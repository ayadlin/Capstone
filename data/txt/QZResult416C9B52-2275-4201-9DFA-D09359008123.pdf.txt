ABSTRACT
New delivery systems including liposomes have been developed to circumvent
drug resistance. To enhance the antitumor efficacy of liposomes encapsulating anticancer agents, we used liposomes externally conjugated to the 20 residue peptide
gH625. Physicochemical characterization of the liposome system showed a size of
140 nm with uniform distribution and high doxorubicin encapsulation efficiency.
We evaluated the effects of increasing concentrations of liposomes encapsulating
Doxo (LipoDoxo), liposomes encapsulating Doxo conjugated to gH625 (LipoDoxogH625), empty liposomes (Lipo) or free Doxo on growth inhibition of either wild
type (A549) or doxorubicin-resistant (A549 Dx) human lung adenocarcinoma. After
72 h, we found that the growth inhibition induced by LipoDoxo-gH625 was higher
than that caused by LipoDoxo with an IC50 of 1 and 0.3 μM in A549 and A549 Dx
cells, respectively. The data on cell growth inhibition were paralleled by an higher
oxidative stress and an increased uptake of Doxo induced by LipoDoxo-gH625
compared to LipoDoxo, above all in A549 Dx cells. Cytometric analysis showed that
the antiproliferative effects of each drug treatment were mainly due to the induction
of apoptosis. In conclusion,liposomes armed with gH625 are able to overcome
doxorubicin resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.

toward cancer cells [1] was demonstrated. An additional
challenge is represented by the intracellular targeting of
key molecules involved in cancer cell regulation once the
efficacious delivery of drugs in cancer cells is achieved. The
encapsulation of drugs in nanometric scaled biocompatible
materials is a potential strategy for the accumulation of the
drugs in the inflamed or tumor tissues through the use of the
so-called and well-known enhanced retention and permeation

INTRODUCTION
One of the most important goals in cancer treatment is
the achievement of pharmacologically active concentrations
of chemotherapy drugs in cancer tissues, avoiding drug
distribution in healthy tissues. In fact, up-to-date a plethora
of pharmacological weapons are available in order to
control cancer growth but for none of these selectivity

effect (EPR) [1]. Once accumulated in tumor tissues
nanocarriers can release the drug or can be internalized in
cancer cells through endocytosis mechanism, resulting in
intracellular trafficking in endosomes. Therefore, cleavage of
the drugs out of nanocarriers and escape from the endosomes
are further critical steps. A complication of cancer therapy
is the potential development of chemoresistance that is due
to the selection of cancer cell clones expressing molecules
that protect tumour cells from anti-cancer agents [2, 3].
In this light, the overexpression of ATP binding cassette
(ABC) transporters - such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp/ABCB1),
multidrug resistance related proteins (MRPs/ABCCs) and
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) - limits
the intracellular retention and cytotoxicity of different
chemotherapy drugs, conferring to tumor cells a multiple
and cross-resistant phenotype known as multidrug resistance
(MDR) [4]. Therefore, after the crossing of the fenestrated
vessels, that are typical of cancer tissues, nanoparticles have
also to overcome cell membrane barriers, release and retain
the drug intracellularly at therapeutic levels for a desired
time. Based on these, cancer cell membranes represent
another critical barrier that affects both drug internalization
and retention in cancer cells.
Among nanosystems used for drug delivery,
liposomes have attracted great attention since they are
ideal for loading and delivery of different molecules,
therefore, offering novel opportunities for cancer
treatment [5–7]. Benefits associated with liposomal
drugs can derive from: i) protection of encapsulated
drugs from chemical and biological degradation into
the blood stream; ii) controlled release and reduced
toxicity through decreased exposure of healthy tissues
to anti-cancer drugs; iii) increased anti-tumor activity
resulting from a relatively long systemic circulation time
(especially in the case of PEGylated liposomes) [8–10];
iv) subsequent extended exposure and accumulation in
growing tumor sites. To enhance the antitumor efficacy
of liposomal drugs and to overcome the obstacle of the
membrane barrier of cancer cells, many research groups
are actively investigating how to improve liposome cell
internalization through the addition of surface ligands.
Recently, several cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) such
as penetratin and Tat have been successfully used for
the intracellular delivery of liposomes [5, 11, 12]. CPPs
are a group of short, positively charged peptides with a
potent ability to penetrate the membrane bilayer, which
are well suited as drug delivery vehicles able to cross the
biological barriers. The advantages of peptides as delivery
enhancers include: i) their relatively small molecular
weight, ii) easy synthesis, iii) relatively low cytotoxicity
and immunogenicity, and iv) in vivo degradation [13].
Cationic cell-penetrating peptide-mediated endocytosis is
one of the mechanisms by which drug carriers cross the
membrane bilayer [14]; subsequently, the cargo is trapped
in endosomes, eventually landing in lysosomes where its
intracellular bioavailability is decreased. In order to avoid
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the endocytic pathway, it is of great importance to discover
new molecules exploiting different mechanisms of uptake.
Hydrophobic peptides that efficiently cross biological
membranes, promoting lipid membrane-reorganizing
processes represent a powerful alternative [15–17]. Viralderived peptides can be useful as Trojan horses due to their
intrinsic properties of inducing membrane perturbations
[16–18].
The twenty residue peptide gH625, previously
identified as a membrane-perturbing domain in the
glycoprotein H (gH) of Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), is able to cross the membrane bilayer [19] and has
been extensively used for vector-mediated strategies
in vitro, which only partially involves the endocytic
pathway [20–24]. We previously showed the drug carrier
ability of gH625 functionalized DOPG based liposomes
encapsulating Doxo and revealed differences between the
uptake mechanisms of free and encapsulated Doxo [22].
Nuclear accumulation of free Doxo was attributed to drug
diffusion, while encapsulated Doxo remained mostly in
the cytoplasm with negligible nuclear accumulation [22].
Here, we investigated the in vitro anti-cancer
activity of Doxo-encapsulating liposomes, constituted
by soy phospholipids, cholesterol and 1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene
glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG), in order to improve
biocompatibility and lead to a prolonged presence in the
systemic circulation.
The anti-proliferative effects of liposomal formu­
lations functionalized or not with gH625 were investigated
on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells
either sensitive or resistant to Doxo. The differential
accumulation and the oxidative stress caused by the two
different formulations in resistant and parental A549 cells
were also evaluated.

RESULTS
Peptide synthesis and conjugation of gH625
to liposomes surface
The peptide gH625-Pra and the liposome component
(C18)2L-N3 were synthesized according to standard solid
phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) protocols with Fmoc/
tBu (tBu = tert-butyl) chemistry. The alkyne moiety of
gH625-Pra was introduced in the peptide sequence at the
C-terminal position as L-propargylglycine. (C18)2L-N3
was synthesized on solid phase following a modified
protocol of the classical Fmoc/tBu strategy [22]. Both
gH625-Pra and (C18)2L-N3 were collected in good yields
(~ 40% and 85%, respectively) after HPLC-RP
purification, and analyzed by mass spectrometry, 1H and
13
C NMR spectroscopy (for (C18)2L-N3), and HPLC to
confirm the compound identity and the purity.
The coupling of gH625 on the surface of preformed
liposomes was performed by click chemistry (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Scheme of the functionalization reaction of gH625 to LipoDoxo.
This procedure involves a copper(I)-catalyzed Huisgen
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of azides and alkynes
yielding 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole-linked conjugates
[25]. The click reaction was performed in an aqueous
solution and was catalyzed by CuI generated, in situ, by
reduction of CuSO4 with ascorbic acid [26]. An equimolar
mixture of NH2-gH625-Pra and azido functions on the
liposome surface were used and the expected gH625functionalized liposomes were obtained with a yield
higher than 90% after 12 h at room temperature. In the
absence of the copper catalyst no reaction was observed.

optimal not only for the more effective extravasation of
liposomes, but also for their longer retention in tumor
tissues. The analysis of the zeta-potential shows a change
between Lipo and LipoDoxo compared to LipoDoxogH625, which indicates a change in the surface of the
liposomes upon functionalization with the peptide.

Release of doxorubicin from liposomes
The release of Doxo was carried out in HEPESNaCl buffer or HEPES-NaCl buffer with 50% FBS and the
results are presented in Figure 2. Free Doxo was used as
control and its release rate was nearly 100% in 2 h, which
means that the release of Doxo from dialysis membrane
to buffer solution is not a restricting factor and the release
of Doxo from the liposomes is the only rate limiting step.
There were no pronounced differences in Doxo release
(Figure 2) from LipoDoxo and LipoDoxo-gH625 at each
time point, indicating that the decoration of the surface
of the liposomes with gH625 did not substantially change
the release kinetics of liposomes. The Doxo release from
liposomes decorated and not with gH625 is less than 30%
within 72 h, indicating their good stability.

Drug loading
Doxo was loaded into soy phospholipid mixture/
cholesterol/DSPE-PEG/(C18)2L-N3 liposomes using
the well-assessed procedure based on the ammonium
sulphate gradient [27]; in particular, a solution containing
Doxo was incubated under stirring for 30 min at 60°C.
Subsequently, unloaded Doxo was removed using a
Sephadex G50 column pre-equilibrated with HEPES-NaCl
buffer (5 mM-100 mM) at pH 7.4. The drug/lipid weight
ratio chosen for the loading experiments was 0.1. The drug
loading content (DLC) was above 90% of the total.
The drug loaded liposomes were then efficiently
modified with the gH625-Pra peptide according to the clickchemistry procedure used in the case of empty liposomes.

Effects of liposomes encapsulating doxorubicin
conjugated or not with gH625 viral peptide on
A549 and A549 Dx cell proliferation
The effects of Doxo, empty liposomes (Lipo)
and liposomes encapsulating Doxo conjugated or not
with gH625 on the proliferation of either parental A549
or Doxo-resistant cells (A549 Dx) were evaluated by
MTT assay as reported in “Materials and Methods”.
Doxo, LipoDoxo and LipoDoxo-gH625 induced a
dose-dependent growth inhibition in both cell lines

Characterization of liposomes
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were
performed on liposomes alone and on gH625 functionalized
liposomes. Table 1 shows that all liposome solutions present
a monomodal distribution with a polydispersity index (PDI)
< 0.2 indicating a narrow and homogenous size distribution,

produced no significant cytotoxic effects in both cell
lines (Figure 3). In Table 2, results are reported as
concentrations inhibiting 50% of cell growth (IC50)
after 72 h of treatment. The IC50 was reached with 0.8
μM and 5 μM of Doxo (Figure 3A and 3B, Table 2),
with 1.6 μM and about 5 μM of LipoDoxo (Figure 3A
and 3B, Table 2), with 1 μM and 0.3 μM of LipoDoxogH625 (Figure 3A and 3B, Table 2) in A549 and A549
Dx cells, respectively. These data suggested that A549
cells were more sensitive to the treatment with Doxo
compared to A549 Dx, confirming the drug-resistant
phenotype of this cell line. Both cell lines were more
responsive to LipoDoxo-gH625 compared to LipoDoxo.
In particular, LipoDoxo-gH625 was able to overcome
resistance in A549 Dx compared to free Doxo. These
data suggested that the conjugation of liposomes with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

gH625 probably facilitated the entry and retention of
doxorubicin in both sensitive and drug-resistant tumor
cell lines allowing an increase of cell growth inhibition.

Doxorubicin accumulation in A549 and A549 Dx
cell lines
The accumulation of doxorubicin, free or
encapsulated in liposomes conjugated or not with
gH625, was investigated by flow cytometry analysis
as reported in “Materials and Methods”. A timedependent accumulation of free and encapsulated
Doxo was observed in A549 and A549 Dx cells and
the maximal levels were reached after 24 h (Figure 4
and 5). Moreover, LipoDoxo-gH625 induced in both cell
lines a greater doxorubicin accumulation than LipoDoxo
(Figure 4 and 5). In details, A549 Dx cells showed an

early accumulation of doxorubicin after 3 h of treatment
with both liposomal formulations and the accumulation
was higher if compared to the one observed in parental
A549 cells (Figure 4 and 5). This effect was more
evident in resistant cells treated with LipoDoxo-gH625
that induced an increase of about 86.9% of MFI against
an increase of about 64.3% of MFI induced in parental
cells (Figure 5 and 4, respectively). Moreover, after
24 h we observed a two-fold increase of percentage of
MFI in A549 Dx cells treated with LipoDoxo-gH625
if compared to those exposed to LipoDoxo (Figure 5).
Similar data were also obtained in parental cells but to
a lesser extent (Figure 4). On the other hand, free Doxo
accumulation was more rapid and slightly higher than
LipoDoxo-gH625 after 12 and 24 h. Therefore, these
data suggested that the conjugation of liposomes with
the viral peptide increased the retention of doxorubicin
into the cells supporting the data obtained on the growth
inhibition.

The effects of Doxo and liposomes encapsulating
doxorubicin conjugated or not with gH625 were also
evaluated for analyzing the accumulation of superoxide
anions (O2−) in either parental or Doxo A549 cells, as
reported in “Materials and Methods”. In both cell lines free
Doxo induced a time-dependent accumulation of superoxide
anions (Figure 6 and 7) significantly lower compared to that
induced by both liposomal formulations. In details, after
24 h LipoDoxo-gH625 and LipoDoxo induced a similar
accumulation of O2− and this effect was maintained up to the
end of treatment (72 h) with LipoDoxo-gH625 differently
from LipoDoxo on A549 cells (Figures 6). On the other
hand, both formulations induced similar effects on A549
Dx cells after 24 h of treatment, but a significant increase
of oxidative stress was observed after 72 h of treatment
with LipoDoxo-gH625 if compared to the one induced

effect on the increase of O2− levels in contrast to H2O2 and
acted as a scavenger in combination with H2O2 (Figures 6

The data obtained on oxidative stress suggested a greater
internalization of LipoDoxo-gH625 than LipoDoxo in A549

“Materials and Methods”. In agreement with the data

LipoDoxo induced late apoptosis in about 5.5% of
A549 cells while necrosis was recorded in about 36.5%
of A549 cells after 24 h of treatment (Figure 8). This
effect was potentiated also in doxorubicin-resistant cells
by LipoDoxo-gH625 that caused about 3.8% of late

Intracellular distribution of Doxo in A549
and A549 Dx cells

21.1% of late apoptotic cells were recorded after 24 h.
This effect was more marked when using LipoDoxogH625 with about 41.8% of necrotic cells and about
23.3% of apoptotic cells (Figure 9). Free doxorubicin
induced more significant effects on A549 cells than on
A549 Dx cells but to a lesser extent. In fact, it caused an
accumulation of about 25.7% and 16.4% of necrotic cells
in A549 and A549 Dx cells, respectively (Figure 8 and
9, respectively).
On the basis of these results, it can be suggested
that LipoDoxo-gH625 induced more significant effects
on cell death in both cell lines, but with different
mechanisms. In fact, we have found that the main
mechanism by which LipoDoxo caused cell death in
parental A549 was necrosis while it caused apoptosis
in doxorubicin-resistant counterpart. These effects were
potentiated by LipoDoxo-gH625 in both experimental
cell models (Figure 8 and 9).

In order to investigate the intracellular distribution
of the different formulations, the Doxo fluorescence
associated to the cells was evaluated by confocal laser
scanning microscopy (CLSM). A549 and A549 Dx
were incubated with IC50s of free Doxo, LipoDoxo and
LipoDoxo-gH625 for 6 and 24 h. After 6 h, free Doxo and
LipoDoxo-gH625 entered A549 cells and translocated
into the nucleus as indicated by the red fluorescence in
the center of the cell body (Figure 10A) while LipoDoxo
accumulate in the cytoplasm, without entering into
the nucleus (Figure 10 A). In fact, cell nuclei are dark
and only few red fluorescent spots, distributed in the
cytoplasm, are visible. No fluorescence was observed
in A549 treated with empty liposome as expected. On
the other hand, in A549 Dx free Doxo was not able
to enter into the nucleus accumulating in perinuclear
region while CLSM results showed a widespread and

multiple myeloma in 2007. In 2013 the use of the
generic version Lipodox was approved for treatment
of ovarian cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma [1]. Doxil is
formulated from a combination of fully hydrogenated soy
phosphatidylcholine (HSPC), cholesterol, and a lipid with
a polyethylene glycol (PEG) head group (DSPE-PEG2k)
in a mole ratio of 56.4:38.3:5.3. The DSPE-PEG provides
a polymer coating that can inhibit protein adhesion and
prolong evasion of mononuclear phagocytic system
(MPS) [4, 12] . Such coatings lead to long circulation halftimes (3–4 days in humans) and are essential to achieve
significant passive accumulation at a tumor site.
Successful design of nanosystems to treat tumor
effectively requires the appropriate surface modification
to enhance the uptake; in fact, the activity of cytotoxic
drugs that are internalized by cells depends also on their
concentration and availability in the cell cytosol and
nuclei. Peptide gH625 represents a novel opportunity
to overcome the known limits of classical CPPs and
proved to be successful for delivery of several molecules,
therefore was chosen in our study to increase the cell
internalization of liposomes into cells.
The different phospholipids used to prepare
the liposomes investigated in the present study are of
paramount importance to determine the uptake and
mechanism of internalization. We have previously reported
preliminary results on the internalization of DOPG
liposomes decorated on their surface with gH625 and we
proved that gH625 allowed to modify the mechanism of
internalization of Doxo, but the eukaryotic membranes
are zwitterionic; thus DOPG, being negatively charged,
does not well mimics eukaryotic cell membranes. In this
study we used liposomes with enhanced biomimetics
characteristics (phospholipids derived by soy) and
functionalized on their external surface with PEG.
Moreover, we examined the potential of gH625
targeted liposomes to efficiently deliver encapsulated
Doxo into target cells and, consequently, to determine
significant cytotoxicity in drug-sensitive cells (A549)
as well as in drug-resistant cells (A549 Dx). The results
described in the present manuscript, suggest that

DISCUSSION
A major challenge in cancer therapy is the inability
to deliver the chemotherapeutic agents to target tumor
cells and tissues selectively, resulting in severe side
effects to normal tissues and organs. Nanotechnology
has the potential to promote delivery of drugs improving
specificity and enhancing the uptake [28–30]. Moreover,
the multidrug resistance (MDR) represents the principal
mechanism by which many cancers develop resistance
to chemotherapy, and poses the major obstacle to the
successful clinical treatments of cancers [31, 32].
Due to these problems, it is highly important to
explore alternative strategies for utilizing currently
available drugs against MDR cancer cells. For many
platforms designed for intracellular delivery, uptake occurs
by an endocytic pathway. Although endocytic pathways
can be very efficient in internalization, drug release and
endosomal escape are key challenges in achieving high
therapeutic efficacy.
Thus, current challenges include developing
platforms with improved biodistribution, pharmacokinetic
properties, and active targeting. While various active
targeting strategies have been explored, there are no FDAapproved platforms [4, 33] highlighting the difficulties in
reliably improving accumulation at the tumor site with
active targeting.

LipoDoxo-gH625 can be used as an in vivo drug delivery
system to bypass P-gp-mediated efflux of Doxo from
the cells, thus circumventing drug-resistance of tumor
cells. The crucial finding of this study was that only the
LipoDoxo-gH625, but not LipoDoxo or free Doxo, led to
substantially enhanced uptake and nuclear accumulation
of encapsulated Doxo in both A549 and A549 Dx cells
but at a higher extent in Doxo-resistant cells. The results
described suggest that LipoDoxo-gH625 is internalized by
cells more efficiently than LipoDoxo. This was supported
by our confocal microscopic study showing that the
LipoDoxo-gH625 was extensively accumulating within
the cell and, above all in the nucleus. This clearly indicates
that gH625 affects the process of liposome internalization
via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The presence of
gH625 on the surface of liposomes favored their uptake
in both sensitive and drug-resistant tumor cell lines
allowing an increase of cell growth inhibition: in fact, a
greater quantity of Doxo from functionalized liposomes
is accumulated into cells compared to not functionalized
ones; however, even with the gH625-targeted liposomes
the extents of Doxo accumulation were slightly lower
than those of free Doxo as shown by FACS analysis. On
the other hand, we observed similar cytotoxicities of free
Doxo alone and gH625 targeted-liposomes on A549 cells
but LipoDoxo-gH625 was much more potent on A549
Dx growth inhibition. Moreover, LipoDoxo-gH625 was
able to induce increased cell death and oxidative stress
compared to LipoDoxo and free Doxo on both cell lines.
In particular, LipoDoxo and LipoDoxo gh625 induced
necrosis in parental cells and apoptosis in resistant cells.
These liposomal formulations are able to induce apoptosis
in resistant cells that are known to be less prone to undergo
apoptosis induced by conventional drugs.
As an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex-I, Doxo
[34] produces ROS that can result in oxidative stress
and subsequent apoptosis. Opening of the mitochondrial
permeability transition pore (MPT) and the disruption of
mitochondrial transmembrane potential are also central
steps in the apoptotic cell death signaling pathway.
However, it has recently become evident that mitochondria
can also play a critical role in primary necrosis. Damage to
mitochondria may result in disruption to the mitochondrial
electron transport chain, which would, in turn, result in
reduced ATP production and consequently in a disruption
of the bioenergetic state of the cells leading to necrotic
cell death [35]. The mechanisms underlying the cell death
mode switch have been analyzed in several cell types, and
a few conclusions have been proposed, including decrease
in the intracellular level of ATP [36]. These liposomal
formulations by generating high levels of ROS that
probably reduced ATP pools induced a switch between
apoptosis and necrosis.
At present, it is not fully understood how ROS
trigger both necrosis and apoptosis, but the ROS quantity
seems to be critical for determining the cell death mode.

A higher oxidative stress is obtained after treatment with
functionalized liposomes for 72 h indicating that probably
also other mechanisms contribute to the activity in presence
of gH625. In addition, drug-free liposomes displayed no
cytotoxicity against A549 and A549 Dx at the evaluated
concentrations, indicating that these formulations were
unable to induce growth inhibition or cell death.
This may mean that the amount of Doxo delivered
in the cells is less important in determining the cytotoxic
potential of the drug than the mechanism by which it is
delivered. We tentatively propose that Doxo entering the
cell by means of Lipodoxo-gH625 is delivered deeper into
the cell interior than free Doxo, conceivably closer to the
nucleus. As a consequence, a major fraction of the drug
escapes expulsion by the P-gp pump and is sequestered by
the nearby nucleus, where it can exert its cytostatic action.
Riganti group characterized A549 and A549 Dx with regard
to the ABC transporter expression [37]. In some instances,
however, the expression of these drug efflux pumps has
no effect on the total cellular accumulation of multidrug
resistance substrates. The net intracellular accumulation of
the anthracycline doxorubicin, for example, is unaltered by
the expression of either MRP1 or Pgp, even if the cellular
toxicity of the drug is mitigated by the presence of these
transport proteins [38]. Rajagopal et al. [38] showed that
the expression of MRP1-EGFP resulted in decreased
nuclear accumulation of doxorubicin. In particular, CLSM
showed that LipoDoxo-gH625 efficiently accumulated in
A549 Dx nucleus compared to LipoDoxo after 6 h and
at higher extent after 24 h while free Doxo was not able
to enter the nucleus and accumulates in the perinuclear
region. FACS analysis demonstrated that intracellular
accumulation of free Doxo in A549 Dx cells was slightly
higher than LipoDoxo-gH625 accumulation analysis but
only LipoDoxo-gH625 was able to reach cell nucleus
inducing apoptosis and oxidative stress.
Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that at least some
drug release occurs already during the binding stage at
the cell surface. Thus, the physicochemical properties of
the liposomes, in addition to the presence of the targeting
device, may be a key factor in determining the extent of
intra-nuclear Doxo accumulation, and hence the cytotoxic
efficiency of the drug.
Above all in the MDR cells the combination of a
high rate of internalization and the subsequent release of
Doxo might overload the capacity of drug efflux by P-gp,
thus contributing to the relief from drug resistance.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, Doxo encapsulated in functionalized
liposomes accumulated in the nuclei of Doxo-resistant
cancer cells indicating that the peptide gH625 was
probably able to induce a greater and more rapid
internalization also in resistant cells, which could
contribute to circumvent multidrug resistance and improve

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fmoc-protected amino acid derivatives, coupling
reagents, and Rink amide p-methylbenzhydrylamine
(MBHA) resin were purchased from CalbiochemNovabiochem (Laufelfingen, Switzerland). Fmocl-propargylglycine (Fmoc-Pra-OH) was purchased
from Polypeptide (Strasbourg, France). Doxorubicin
hydrochloride and the other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma–Aldrich, Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland),
or LabScan (Stillorgan, Ireland) and were used as
received, unless otherwise stated. All phospholipids
were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,
AL); in particular the soybean phospholipid mixture
is composed of Soy PC (3.8 mg) Soy PE (3.0 mg)
Soy PI (1.8 mg) Soy PA (0.7 mg) Soy LPC (0.7 mg)
with 0.1% butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Culture

purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA).
Dihydroethidium (DHE) was purchased from SigmaAldrich (Milan, Italy).

Liposomes preparation
Liposomes were prepared by the thin lipid
film hydration procedure. Mixed aggregates of
soy phospholipid mixture/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG/
(C18)2L-N3 (57:28:5:10 molar ratio) were prepared by
dissolving the lipids in a small amount of chloroform,
and subsequently evaporating the solvent by slowly
rotating the tube containing the solution under a stream
of nitrogen and lyophilized overnight. In this way a thin
film of amphiphiles was obtained. The dry lipid film
was suspended in HEPES-NaCl buffer (5 mM-100 mM)
at pH 7.4 by vortexing for 1 h; then the lipid suspension
was freeze–thawed ten times and extruded ten times
thought a polycarbonate membrane with 100 nm pore
size using a thermobarrel extruder (Northern Lipids).

Solid-phase synthesis of gH625 and AzideAdOO-Lys(C(O)CH2CH2C(O)N-(C18H37)2)-amide

Functionalization of liposomes with gH625
This procedure of functionalization of liposomes
involves a copper(I)-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar
cyclo-addition reaction of azides and alkynes yielding
1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole linked conjugates. The
unreactive nature of both azides and alkynes towards
any other functional group present in the biomolecules,
as well as the thermal and hydrolytical stability of their
cycloaddition product make this reaction particularly
appealing for liposome functionalization with peptides.
The click reaction was carried out on preformed
soy phospholipid mixture/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG/
(C18)2L-N3 liposomes adding CuSO4•5H2O (4.4 equiv),
ascorbic acid (6.7 equiv), and the peptide derivative
(1 equiv). In particular, solutions containing
CuSO4•5H2O (60.5 mM, solution A), ascorbic acid
(81.4 mM, solution B), and the alkyn-modified peptide
(1 mM, solution C) were freshly prepared in water. The
reaction was catalyzed by Cu(I) generated, in situ, by
reduction of CuSO4 with ascorbic acid.
Solution A (11.6 μL), solution B (13.2 μL), and
solution C (145.4 μL) were added to a suspension of azido-

The peptide was synthesized using standard solidphase 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) procedures
with a Syro I MultiSynThec GmbH (Wullener, Germany)
automatic synthesizer using a Rink amide MBHA resin
(substitution: 0.51 mmol/g; synthesis scale: 20 μmol). The
peptide was obtained by repeated cycles of deprotection
and coupling. Coupling: 4 equiv of Fmoc-protected amino
acids relative to resin loading, HBTU (0.5 M in DMF, 4
equiv), HOBt (0.5 M in DMF, 4 equiv), and DIPEA (2 M
in DMF, 8 equiv). Deprotection: 30% piperidine (v/v) in
DMF for 10 min (2 times). All couplings were performed
twice for 0.5 h. Fmoc-Pra-OH was coupled once for 45
min with 2 equivalents of PyBop/HOBt and 4 equivalents
of DIPEA. The peptide was fully deprotected and cleaved
from the resin with a solution of TFA/water/anisole/
thioanisole 93.5/2.5/2.0/2.0 at room temperature for
300 min, and then precipitated with ice-cold ethyl ether,
filtered, dissolved in water, and lyophilized. The crude
peptide was purified by RP-HPLC on a LC8 Shimadzu
HPLC system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan)

concentration of solution C was determined measuring the
absorbance with a UV/Vis Jasco V-5505 spectrophotometer.
The reaction mixture was stirred at 40°C for
30 min and left overnight at room temperature. After the

of fresh medium. The Doxo concentrations were calculated
based on the fluorescence absorbance intensity of Doxo
excited at 485 nm using a previously established calibration
curve. The cumulative amount of Doxo released over the
72 h was quantified, and results were plotted against time.

Doxo encapsulation in liposomes

Human lung adenocarcinoma cell line wild
type (A549) and doxorubicin (Doxo)-resistant (A549
Dx) were kindly provided by Chiara Riganti, MD
(Department of Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry,
University of Turin, Italy). Both cell lines were grown
in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100
mg/mL streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine and 1% sodium
pyruvate. The resistance to Doxo in A549 Dx cell line
was maintained by administering 10 nM of Doxo in
alternating steps. A549 and A549 Dx cells were cultured
at a constant temperature of 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide (CO2).

Cell culture

Doxorubicin was remote-loaded in soy phospholipid
mixture/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG/(C18)2L-N3
liposomes
through the ammonium sulphate gradient method and the free
Doxo was removed by gel filtration. Briefly, the liposomal
film was suspended in an ammonium sulphate solution
(250 mM) at pH 5.5. The external buffer was removed
by ultracentrifugation at 40000 rpm (Beckman Optima
L-70 Ultracentrifuge) at 4°C for 3 h, and liposomes were
resuspended in HEPES-NaCl buffer (5 mM-100 mM) at pH
7.4. A Doxo solution in water was added to the liposomal
solution. This suspension was stirred for 30 min at 60°C.
The unloaded Doxo was removed using a Sephadex G50
column and the Doxo concentration was determined by
UV spectroscopy measuring the absorbance at λ = 480 nm.
The drug loading content (DLC, defined as the weight ratio
of encapsulated Doxo vs. the amphiphilic moieties) was
quantified by subtraction of the amount of Doxo removed
from the total amount of Doxo loaded. Finally, Doxo preloaded liposomes were modified with gH625 using the clickchemistry reaction procedure, as reported above.

Cell proliferation assay
The evaluation of cell proliferation was performed
on human lung adenocarcinoma cell line wild type and
doxorubicin resistant in the presence of increasing
concentrations of LipoDoxo, LipoDoxo-gH625 and
Lipo in a range of 5–0.04 μM or free Doxo in a range
of 3–0.02 μM. A549 and A549 Dx cells were seeded
in 96-well plates in a number of 25 × 102 per well. The
growth inhibition was assessed by MTT viability assay
after 72 h of treatment as previously described [40]. Then
the concentrations inhibiting 50% of cell growth (IC50)
were obtained and these values were used for subsequent
experiments. MTT assay was carried out by triplicate
determination on at least three separate experiments.
All data are expressed as mean ± SD.

Particle size and zeta potential analyses
The hydrodynamic diameters (DH) and polydispersity
index (PDI) of liposomes (Lipo), Doxo-loaded liposomes
(LipoDoxo) and Doxo-loaded liposomes-gH625
(LipoDoxo-gH625) were measured using dynamic light
scattering (DLS) (Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malven,
UK). The zeta potential of LipoDoxo-gH625 was
determined using a Malvern NanoZ (Malvern Zetasizer
Nano ZS, Malven, UK). The analysis were performed with
He–Ne laser 4 mW operating at 633 nm at scattering angle
fixed at 173° and at 25°C. The results were determined
three times for each sample and each measurement was
performed at least in triplicate.

Flow cytometric analysis of Doxo accumulation
The accumulation of Doxo was analyzed by
FACSAria™ (BD Bioscences) after treating A549 and
A549 Dx cells with a fixed concentration (10 μM) of
Lipo, LipoDoxo, LipoDoxo-gH625 and Doxo. Briefly,
A549 and A549 Dx cells were seeded in 6-well plates in
a number of 2 × 105 cells per well and were treated 24 h
later with each formulation and free Doxo. After 3, 6,
12 and 24 h of treatment cells were trypsinezed, washed
twice with PBS 1X and pellets were resuspended in 500
μL of PBS 1X. Doxo fluorescence associated to the cells
was measured using FL2 channel and calculated as mean
fluorescence intensity (MFIs) for each sample. For each
sample, 2 × 104 events were acquired. Analysis was
carried out by triplicate determination on at least three
separate experiments.

In vitro Doxo release from liposomes
The in vitro release of Doxo from LipoDoxo and
LipoDoxo-gH625 was determined using a dialysis method.
Briefly, free Doxo and Doxo-loaded liposomes (with
free Doxo removed) were placed in a dialysis bag (MW
cut off of 1000 Da) and dialyzed against HEPES-NaCl
and HEPES-NaCl with 50% fetal bovine serum under
continuous stirring at 37°C. At predetermined time intervals,
aliquots were withdrawn and replaced with an equal volume

solution and permeabilized for 10 minutes with 0.1%
(w/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
at room temperature. To prevent nonspecific interactions
of antibodies, cells were treated for 2 h in 5% bovine
albumin serum (BSA) in PBS, then cells were incubated
with a specific mouse monoclonal Ab raised against
vimentin (1:1,000 in blocking solution, 3% (w/w) BSA
in TBS-Tween 0.1%, Sigma) for 2 h at 37° C. After
several washes, cells were incubated with a secondary
IgG goat anti-mouse antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) diluted 1:1,000 in blocking
solution for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were
mounted on microscope slides by Mowiol. The analyses
were performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope
equipped with a plan-apochromat objective X 63 (NA
1.4) in oil immersion. The fluorescences of the Doxo
and Alexa Fluor 488 were collected in multi-track
mode using BP550–625 and LP650 as emission filters,
respectively.

The evaluation of ROS accumulation was detected
using dihydroethidium (DHE), a specific marker for
the determination of reactive oxygen species, in detail
superoxide anion. Once oxidized within the cell, DHE is
converted into ethidium (HE) and emits at the wavelength
of 605 nm. Briefly, A549 and A549 Dx cells were seeded
in 6-well plates in a number of 2 × 105 cells per well and
were treated 24 h later with concentration inhibiting 50% of
cell growth of each formulation and Doxo. A549 and A549
DX cells were also treated with 500 μM of H2O2, which
is able to induce superoxide anion formation, 2000 μM of
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as antioxidant agent, and H2O2 in
combination with NAC. At the end of treatments, A549 and
A549 Dx cells were incubated for 1 h with 20 ng/mL DHE
stock solutions (2.5 mg/mL). At the time of processing, cells
were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS 1X and the pellet
was resuspended in 500 μl of PBS 1X. The dye accumulation
was measured using FL2 channel by BD FACSAria™ (BD
Bioscences) analysis and calculated as mean fluorescence
intensity (MFIs) for each sample. For each sample, 2 × 104
events were acquired. Analysis was carried out by triplicate
determination on at least three separate experiments.

Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical
analysis was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with Neumann-Keul's multiple comparison test or
Kolmogorov-Smirnov where appropriate.

Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis
Apoptotic cell death was analysed by Annexin-V–
FITC staining and by propidium iodide (PI) detection
systems (eBioscences, Vienna, Austria). Briefly, A549
and A549 Dx cells were seeded in 6-well plates in a
number of 2 × 105 cells per well and were treated 24 h
later with concentration inhibiting 50% of cell growth of
LipoDoxo, LipoDoxo-gH625, Doxo and 5 μM of Lipo
(concentration proved to be not toxic). After 3 h-6 h-12
h-24 h of treatment cells were trypsinezed, washed twice
with PBS 1X and pellets were resuspended in 200 μL
Binding Buffer 1X. Then, 5 μL Annexin V-FITC were
added to 195 μL cell suspension, mixed and incubated for
10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 200
μL Binding Buffer 1X, resuspended in 190 μL Binding
buffer 1X and 10 μL Propidium Iodide (20 μg/mL) was
added. The detection of viable cells, early apoptosis cells,
late apoptosis cells and necrotic cells were performed by
FACSAria™ (BD Bioscences) by using a blue laser (488
nm) with three detection filters 480/10 (SSC/FSC), 530/30
(FITC) and 610/20 (PI) [41]. For each sample, 2 × 104
events were acquired. Analysis was carried out by triplicate
determination on at least three separate experiments.
