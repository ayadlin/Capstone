Abstract
Human polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (hPNKP) is a
57.1-kDa enzyme that phosphorylates DNA 5¶-termini and
dephosphorylates DNA 3¶-termini. hPNKP is involved in both
single- and double-strand break repair, and cells depleted of
hPNKP show a marked sensitivity to ionizing radiation.
Therefore, small molecule inhibitors of hPNKP should
potentially increase the sensitivity of human tumors to
;-radiation. To identify small molecule inhibitors of hPNKP,
we modified a novel fluorescence-based assay to measure the
phosphatase activity of the protein, and screened a diverse
library of over 200 polysubstituted piperidines. We identified
five compounds that significantly inhibited hPNKP phosphatase activity. Further analysis revealed that one of these
compounds, 2-(1-hydroxyundecyl)-1-(4-nitrophenylamino)-6phenyl-6,7a-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5,7(2H,4aH)dione (A12B4C3), was the most effective, with an IC50 of 0.06
Mmol/L. When tested for its specificity, A12B4C3 displayed
no inhibition of two well-known eukaryotic protein phosphatases, calcineurin and protein phosphatase-1, or APTX,
another human DNA 3¶-phosphatase, and only limited
inhibition of the related PNKP from Schizosaccharomyces
pombe. At a nontoxic dose (1 Mmol/L), A12B4C3 enhanced
the radiosensitivity of human A549 lung carcinoma and
MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells by a factor of
two, which was almost identical to the increased sensitivity
resulting from shRNA-mediated depletion of hPNKP. Importantly, A12B4C3 failed to increase the radiosensitivity of the
hPNKP-depleted cells, implicating hPNKP as the principal
cellular target of A12B4C3 responsible for increasing the
response to radiation. A12B4C3 is thus a useful reagent for
probing hPNKP cellular function and will serve as the lead
compound for further development of PNKP-targeting drugs.

Introduction
Radiation and systemic chemotherapy continue to be important
therapeutic modalities for the treatment of cancer. Nuclear DNA is
considered to be the major cellular target responsible for the
cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation and many conventional antineoplastic drugs. As a consequence, the levels of DNA damage and its
repair are likely to influence cell survival and affect clinical

outcome (1), and the manipulation of DNA repair systems has
recently become the focus of considerable interest as a means of
enhancing the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Particular emphasis has been placed on single- and double-strand
break repair pathways (2). Small molecule inhibitors have now
been developed that target enzymes such as poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, which
are involved in the repair of damaged bases and single-strand
breaks induced by many agents including ionizing radiation
and alkylating agents (1, 3, 4), tyrosyl DNA-phosphodiesterase,
which is required for the repair of strand breaks introduced by
topoisomerase 1 inhibitors such as camptothecin and irinotecan
(5), and ATM and DNA-PK, which regulate the response to DNA
double-strand breaks (6, 7). Inhibitors of PARP are now in clinical
trial (8).
Ionizing radiation and other genotoxic agents often generate
strand breaks with incompatible termini that must be processed
for single- and double-strand break repair pathways to complete
the repair. Among the frequently observed termini are 3¶-phosphate
and phosphoglycolate and 5¶-hydroxyl groups (9–11). These lesions
create a barrier for DNA polymerases and ligases to replace missing
bases and seal the breaks because these enzymes have a strict
requirement for the presence of a 3¶-hydroxyl group and in addition
DNA ligases require a 5¶-phosphate group (12, 13). It is now clear
that the major enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of
5¶-hydroxyl termini and dephosphorylation of 3¶-phosphate termini
in human cells is polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (hPNKP;
refs. 14, 15). In the single-strand break repair pathway, hPNKP acts
in concert with XRCC1, DNA polymerase h, and DNA ligase III
(16–18), whereas PNKP-mediated DNA end processing at doublestrand breaks is a component of the nonhomologous end-joining
pathway and is dependent on DNA-PKcs and XRCC4 (19–21). In
addition to its role in the repair of strand breaks produced directly
by genotoxic agents, hPNKP has been implicated in the repair of
strand breaks produced by DNA glycosylases such as NEIL1 and
NEIL2 (22, 23), and the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin
(24). Given the involvement of hPNKP in several repair pathways, it
is not surprising that its down-regulation by RNAi-sensitized cells
to a variety of genotoxic agents including ionizing radiation,
camptothecin, methyl methanesulfonate, and hydrogen peroxide
(25). It remains to be determined which of hPNKP’s activities,
5¶-kinase or 3¶-phosphatase (or both), is responsible for sensitization to each agent. The two activities are independent with each
active site containing its own DNA binding domain (26), but the
phosphatase reaction seems to proceed ahead of the kinase
reaction (27).
It has recently been suggested that PNKP could be a potential
target for small molecule inhibitors (2, 28). We report here the
development of a fluorescence-based assay for screening chemical

libraries for inhibitors of the phosphatase activity of PNKP and its
application in the screening of a library of drug-like polysubstituted
piperidines. The compound scaffold in this library possesses a
range of stable functionalities such as imide, hydroxyl, and basic
amino groups that confer hydrogen bond donor/acceptor capabilities that could promote interaction with proteins (29). We have
identified several compounds that inhibit hPNKP phosphatase
activity and further show that one of these compounds sensitized
cells to ionizing radiation. It thus has the potential to be a useful
laboratory reagent for studying the role of hPNKP in the cellular
response to ionizing radiation and other genotoxins, and act as the
initial compound in the development of a drug targeting hPNKP in
the course of cancer therapy.

Enzymes. Recombinant hPNKP was purified as described previously
(15, 30) and stored in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mmol/L NaCl,
5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 0.5 mmol/L DTT. Recombinant mouse PNKP was
purified as previously described (26). Schizosaccharomyces pombe PNKP
was purified as described previously (31). Phage T4 polynucleotide kinase
was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. The catalytic subunit of human
protein phosphatase-1g (PP-1cg) was expressed in Escherichia coli and
purified as previously described (32). Rat y-calcineurin protein was
expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (33).
Human recombinant aprataxin (APTX) protein with an NH2-terminal 6
His tag was expressed in BL21-Gold (DE3) E. coli–competent cells
(Stratagene) using the QIAgene expression construct (Qiagen). A single
colony of kanamycin-resistant E. coli was used to inoculate a 200-mL
overnight culture in Luria-Bertani media containing 30 Ag/mL kanamycin.
Four 50-mL fractions of overnight culture were then subcultured into 4  1
L Luria-Bertani without kanamycin. Once the culture reached an
absorbance of f0.6 at 600 nm, protein expression was induced using 0.2
mmol/L isopropyl-1-thio-h-galactopyranoside (Sigma) at 37jC for 2 h. Cells
were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4jC and
resuspended in 40 mL buffer [50 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 250 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; pH 7.9)]. The solution was
then stirred on ice for 30 min in the presence of 30 mg lysozyme and 4 mg
PMSF, and 1 Ag/mL each of pepstatin and leupeptin. The bacteria were then
sonicated 6  30 s allowing 30 s between intervals to cool down. The cell
debris was then spun down at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4jC and the
supernatant collected. The supernatant was then stirred on ice in the
presence of 4 mL Probond resin (Invitrogen) for 1 h and then loaded onto a
column. The resin was washed with 3  5 mL 20 mmol/L imidiazole and
5-mL fractions were collected. Then, 25 mL of 150 mmol/L imidazole was
loaded onto the column and 1-mL fractions were collected. Fractions were
run on a 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue
R-250 (Invitrogen). Fractions (150 mmol/L) showing high concentrations
and single bands were then combined and concentrated using a 30-kDa
cutoff Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter (Millipore) and dialyzed with
50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, and 5 mmol/L MgCl2.
His-APTX concentration was then determined using the Bio-Rad Protein
assay (Bio-Rad).
Cells. A549 (human lung carcinoma cells) and MDA-MB-231 (human
breast adenocarcinoma cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. Cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM/nutrient mixture
F-12 (DMEM/F-12) supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin (50 U/mL),
streptomycin (50 Ag/mL), L-glutamine (2 mmol/L), nonessential amino acids
(0.1 mmol/L), and sodium pyruvate (1 mmol/L), and maintained at 37jC
under 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. All culture supplies were purchased
from Invitrogen. The generation of PNKP-depleted A549 cells has been
previously described (25). The PNKP-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells were
generated in a similar fashion except that the shRNA-expressing pSUPER
vector used on this occasion (pSUPER.neo, OligoEngine) also contained the
cDNA for the G418 selectable marker.

Inhibitor of Polynucleotide Kinase/Phosphatase
Optimization of fluorescence quenching–based assay for PNKP
3¶-phosphatase activity. We modified the Lightspeed assay developed
originally for protein kinases and phosphatases by QTL Biosystems
(This reagent is no longer produced or distributed by QTL Biosystems).
The standard substrate used for this assay was a 20-mer oligonucleotide
(5¶-TAMRA-AAT ACG AAT GCC CAC ACC GC-P-3¶) labeled with
5-(6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) (TAMRA) at the 5¶-end and bearing a
terminal 3¶-phosphate (Integrated DNA Technologies). The TAMRA-labeled
oligonucleotide lacking a 3¶-phosphate served as a control. Four
calibration solutions, consisting of 0%, 25%, 50%, and 100% 3¶phosphorylated oligonucleotide, were prepared by mixing the two
oligonucleotides (i.e., 3¶-phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated oligonucleotides) in respective proportions (0.5 Amol/L total oligonucleotide
concentration). The assay was performed in 384-well white Optiplate
microplates (PerkinElmer) in 70 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 60 mmol/L
MgCl2, 5 mmol/L MnCl2, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.09%
sodium azide. Reaction buffer was prepared by adding 1 mmol/L DTT
immediately before use. Five microliters of 3¶-phosphatase substrate ( final
concentration 0.5 Amol/L) were used per well. In duplicate, 10 AL of
each concentration of hPNKP was added per well. Plates were incubated
for 1 h at 37jC and then 15 AL of 1 sensor solution (provided by QTL)
were added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
Fluorescence (485 nm excitation and 520 nm emission wavelengths) of
each well was read in a FLUOstar Optima (BMG Labtech, Inc.). Data were
analyzed using GraphPad Prism Software.

Acquisition and screening of the small molecule library. A previously
described library of 244 polysubstituted piperidines (29) encompassing
a diversity of functional groups and substituents was synthesized as
described (29) and used for the screening. Small molecules were provided
in powder form and were dissolved in 100% DMSO, and a final
concentration of 100 Amol/L was added to each well and assays were
performed as described above.
After obtaining an optimum calibration curve and enzyme concentration
curve, we used a simplified form of the assay to test the library in a short
time. Only one concentration of hPNKP, 50 ng, was tested and compared
with the control well with no enzyme. The assay was conducted in the same
way as described above with respect to oligonucleotides, buffer, controls,
incubation lengths/temperatures, centrifugations, and sensor addition.
Assay for 3¶-phosphatase activity based on the release of inorganic
phosphate. hPNKP phosphatase reactions (20 AL total volume) were setup
as follows: 1 AL hPNKP (100 ng), 2 AL 10 phosphatase buffer [500 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L spermidine, and 2.5 mmol/L
DTT], 15 AL distilled H2O, and 1 AL small molecule (varying concentrations)
were incubated at 37jC for 5 min, and then 2 AL of 1 mmol/L 3¶-P 20mer
oligonucleotide was added (The oligonucleotide had the same sequence as
that used in the fluorescence quenching assay, but without the TAMRA
substituent). The reactions were then transferred to a clear polystyrene
colorimetric 384-well plate and incubated at 37jC for 30 min. PiColorlock
Gold reagent (Innova Biosciences Ltd.) was prepared shortly before use by
addition of 1/100 vol. of accelerator to PiColorlock Gold reagent as directed

CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega),
better known as the MTS assay. Approximately 2.5  103 A549 cells were

Figure 3. Corroboration of inhibition of hPNKP 3¶-phosphatase activity by
conventional radio-gel assay. A 20-mer oligonucleotide with a 3¶-phosphate was
labeled at the 5¶-terminus with [g 32P]ATP (*p20p), which was acted on by hPNKP,
resulting in the removal of the 3¶-phosphate. This produced *p20, which has a
slower mobility in the gel. Addition of the small molecule inhibitors reduces the
conversion of *p20p to *p20. The figure confirms that A12B4C3 strongly inhibits
hPNKP phosphatase activity, whereas A4B8C2 is inactive (see Fig. 1C).

by the manufacturer. The Gold mix was then added to inorganic
phosphate–containing samples in a volume ratio of 1:4, and the samples
were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before the absorbance was
read at 620 nm using a FLUOstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech, Inc.).
Conventional radio-gel assay for hPNKP 3¶-phosphatase activity.
hPNKP phosphatase activity was determined by monitoring the removal of
the 3¶-phosphate from a 5¶-32P–labeled 20-mer oligonucleotide containing a
3¶-phosphate (5¶-ATT ACG AAT GCC CAC ACC GC-P-3¶) as previously
described (15). Briefly, the 5¶-end of the oligomer was labeled by incubation
with phage T4 phosphatase–free polynucleotide kinase (Roche Diagnostics)
and [g 32P]ATP (PerkinElmer). To the labeled oligomer, hPNKP that had
been preincubated for 5 min at 37jC with varying concentration of small
molecule inhibitor in phosphatase buffer was added, and the reaction was
allowed to proceed for 20 min. The level of 3¶-dephosphorylation was
monitored by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide/7 mol/L urea
sequencing gel for 3 h in 1 Tris-borate EDTA buffer. Gels were scanned
with a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare), and quantified
using Image Quant 5.2 Software (GE Healthcare).
PP-1c; and calcineurin phosphatase inhibition assay. PP-1cg and
calcineurin activity was analyzed, using a colorimetric p-nitrophenol
phosphate assay as previously described (34). Inhibition reactions were
carried out in a 96-well microplate with a final volume of 60 AL containing
40 AL of p-nitrophenol phosphate assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4),
0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 30 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/L MnCl2, 1 mg/mL BSA,
and 0.2% h-mercaptoethanol], 0.03 Ag PP-1cg (specific activity of >30 units
per mg) or a catalytically equivalent quantity of calcineurin and 10 AL of
0.5 mmol/L or 10 AL of 50 Amol/L A12B4C3 in DMSO, or control solvent.
After a 10-min incubation at 37jC, 10 AL of 30 mmol/L p-nitrophenol
phosphate was added to each well and incubated for an additional 60 and
45 min for PP-1cg and calcineurin, respectively. The absorbance at 405 nm
was measured using a SOFTmax 2.35 kinetic microplate reader (Molecular
Devices).
DNA kinase assay. Kinase reactions (20 AL final volume) were set up as
follows: 1 Ag hPNKP was preincubated with increasing concentration of
A12B4C3 in the kinase buffer [80 mmol/L succinic acid (pH 5.5), 10 mmol/L
MgCl2, and 1.0 mmol/L DTT] at 37jC for 5 min and then 20-mer
oligonucleotide substrate (20 nmol) and 3.3 pmol of [g-32P]ATP were added
and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37jC for 20 min. The reaction
was stopped by addition of an equal volume of DNA loading dye (90%
formamide, 0.02% bromophenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol in 1 TBE).
Samples were boiled for 5 min and the products separated on a 12%
polyacrylamide/8 mol/L urea gel. Gels were scanned with a Typhoon 9400
Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare), and quantified using Image Quant
5.2 Software (GE Healthcare).

Reagent was added to each well and cells were incubated for 4 more hours
at 37jC. The absorbance recorded at 490 nm on a FLUOstar Optima plate
reader was used as a representation of the relative number of living cells in
culture.
Cytotoxicity studies. The effect of hPNKP inhibition by A12B4C3 on
cellular survival following exposure to ionizing radiation was measured in
A549, A549yPNKP, and MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231yPNKP cells by
clonogenic assays. Cells were seeded on 60-mm tissue culture plates at
various concentrations to give between 100 to 1,000 colonies per plate
and returned to the incubator overnight to allow the cells to attach.
For radiosensitization studies, the cells were incubated with or without
1 Amol/L A12B4C3 for 2 h before irradiation and then exposed to increasing
doses of g-radiation (60Co Gammacell, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited).
After irradiation, cells were incubated for a further 24 h in the same media
and then washed twice with PBS and incubated in fresh media without the
inhibitor. Colonies were stained with crystal violet after 10 to 14 d and
counted with an automated Colcount colony counter (Oxford Optronix).

failed to inhibit hPNKP. The formal names and chemical structures
of the active compounds are shown in Fig. 2.
Confirmation of inhibition of PNKP phosphatase activity.
A conventional radio-gel assay was used to verify the inhibition of
hPNKP phosphatase activity by these small molecules. This assay
shows a shift on an acrylamide sequencing gel that corresponds to
3¶-phosphate removal from a 20-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide (36). We confirmed that all five of the positively identified
compounds inhibited hPNKP phosphatase activity. We also
examined a number of small molecules shown by the screening
assay not to be inhibitors of hPNKP phosphatase activity, and they
also failed to show inhibition by the radio-gel approach. Examples
of the assay are shown in Fig. 3.
Inhibitory activity and specificity of A12B4C3. To further
assess the activity of the five inhibitory molecules, we made use
of a proprietary colorimetric reagent (PiColorLock Gold) that
measures release of inorganic phosphate (Pi). A drawback encountered with the fluorescence-based approach can be fluorescence quenching arising from direct interaction of the small

Results
Screening of the library by a fluorescence-based assay. The
fluorescence-based phosphatase assay that we adapted was
originally developed to monitor protein phosphatase activity (35).
The assay involves a fluorescent sensor molecule coupled with
trivalent metal ions that bind to phosphate groups. When the
sensor is brought into close proximity with a phosphorylated and
dye (TAMRA)-labeled substrate, superquenching of the sensor
occurs. Removal of the phosphate leads to an elevation of
fluorescence because the sensor is not brought close enough to
TAMRA for its signal to be quenched. We modified the buffer
conditions so that the internucleotide phosphate groups of a DNA
substrate would not interfere strongly with the process of
measuring the presence of a terminal phosphate group as shown
by the standard curve of 0%, 25%, 50%, and 100% phosphorylated
oligo solutions (Fig. 1A). We then determined the amount of
hPNKP required for near complete dephosphorylation of the
oligonucleotide by measuring the fluorescence signal as a function
of hPNKP present in the reaction (Fig. 1B), and as a result, we
chose 50 ng as the standard quantity of hPNKP for each reaction
in the screen. Heat-inactivated hPNKP was used as a control.
We screened a small molecule library consisting of over
200 polysubstituted piperidines (29) for their capacity to inhibit
the phosphatase activity of hPNKP. Five of the compounds,
A12B4C3, A1B4C3, A6B4C3, A26B11C2, and A39B1C2, were
observed to cause significant inhibition as shown in Fig. 1C. Also
shown are the data for three other compounds, A4B8C2, A28B3C1,
and A24B12C3, as examples of the majority of compounds that

molecule with the sensor agent. (Note in Fig. 1C the lower
fluorescence signal of the sensor caused by exposure to some
compounds in the absence of PNKP). This problem is avoided in
the colorimetric assay, which measures the release of inorganic
phosphate from a 20-mer 3¶-P oligonucleotide based on the change
in absorbance of malachite green in the presence of molybdate.
Based on the standard curve obtained using 0%, 25%, 50%, and
100% phosphorylated substrates (Fig. 4A), we found that A12B4C3
was the most potent of the five PNKP inhibitors (Fig. 4B) and
obtained an IC50 dose of 0.06 Amol/L and near maximal inhibition
with a concentration of 10 Amol/L (Fig. 4C). The curve was fitted to
conform to a single site-specific binding with Hill slope. Deviation
from the curve at high concentration of inhibitor most likely
reflects the limitation of the assay when measuring low levels of
released inorganic phosphate. The IC50 value for the next most
active inhibitor, A6B4C3, was determined and found to be
somewhat higher (f0.3 Amol/L).
Specificity of A12B4C3. To determine the specificity of
A12B4C3 for hPNKP phosphatase activity, we examined a
number of closely related phosphatases such as the PNKP enzymes
isolated from bacteriophage T4, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and
mouse, as well as human APTX. We observed that 50 Amol/L
A12B4C3 inhibited phage T4 and the S. pombe PNKPs by f15% and
f30%, respectively, compared with complete inhibition of hPNKP
(Table 1). Not surprisingly, the compound significantly inhibited
mouse PNKP (which shares f80% identity to hPNKP). We also
tested whether A12B4C3 could inhibit APTX, which is another
human DNA 3¶-phosphatase (37). For this experiment, the
oligonucleotide substrate was incubated with equal quantities of
the two enzymes that were purified from bacteria on the same day.
We observed that APTX has a robust phosphatase activity that was
totally refractory to 50 Amol/L A12B4C3 (Table 1). We then
broadened our examination to look at two well-known protein
phosphatases, calcineurin and PP-1g. Neither enzyme displayed
any inhibition when treated with an A12B4C3 concentration as
high as 83.3 Amol/L, whereas the control inhibitor microcystin LR
reduced the activity of PP1 f65% (Fig. 5A).
Finally, the effect of A12B4C3 on the kinase activity of hPNKP
was examined by quantifying the transfer of 32P-labeled phosphate
from radiolabeled ATP to an oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 5B,
there was a concentration-dependent increase in inhibition of the
PNKP kinase activity up to f45% at 50 Amol/L A12B4C3. However,
the inhibition of the kinase and phosphatase activities cannot be
directly compared because the standard assay for kinase activity
uses 10-fold more enzyme than the assay for phosphatase activity.
Cytotoxicity of A12B4C3 and cellular radiosensitization by
A12B4C3. The data presented indicated that A12B4C3 is a potent
inhibitor of hPNKP in vitro. It was therefore important to assess the
compound’s effectiveness as a radiosensitizer. A12B4C3 was first
tested for its inherent toxicity. Cytotoxicity was measured by cell
proliferation assay after exposure of A549 human lung carcinoma
cells and MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells to increasing
doses of the compound for 72 hours (Fig. 6A). We observed a
dose-dependent reduction in cell proliferation up to f50% at
100 Amol/L A12B4C3, which is close to the limit of solubility of the
compound. No significant effect on cell proliferation was detected
after exposure of either cell line to 1 Amol/L A12B4C3. The lack of
cytotoxicity at this dose was confirmed by clonogenic survival
assay following exposure to A12B4C3 up to 24 hours (data not
shown). We then examined the capacity of A12B4C3 to act as a
radiosensitizer. A549 cells were incubated with 1 Amol/L A12B4C3

for 2 hours before irradiation and then maintained in the presence
of the compound for a further 24 hours. The survival curves
indicated that exposure to A12B4C3 almost doubled the radiosensitivity of A549 cells (Fig. 6B). This radiation response was nearly
identical to that seen with cells depleted of PNKP by stable
expression of shRNA (A549yPNKP). On the other hand, A12B4C3
failed to sensitize the PNKP-depleted cells. Similar data were
obtained with wild-type and PNKP-depleted MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
In this report, we describe the initial steps toward the generation
of a selective hPNKP inhibitor because our previous observations
indicated that PNKP depletion, mediated by shRNA, sensitizes cells
to ionizing radiation (25), and would therefore be an appropriate
target for small molecule inhibition. PNKP possesses 5¶-kinase and
3¶phosphatase activity. For this study, we chose to target the latter
activity, because 3¶-phosphate termini are frequently generated by
ionizing radiation (9, 11). This necessitated the development of a
suitable screening assay for inhibitors of the phosphatase activity.
Most fluorescence-based high throughput screening assays for
phosphatase activity have been directed toward protein phosphatases and rely on immunodetection using antibodies to the
phosphorylated peptide substrate. The superquenching assay,
originally devised by Rininsland and colleagues (35), presented an
alternative approach that depended on the presence of a
phosphate group for chemical recognition. It required some
optimization involving protonation of the substrate to enhance
the influence of the terminal phosphomonoester group over the
internucleotide phosphodiester groups of the DNA substrate. Using
this protocol, a Z-factor of 0.68 was obtained, which is considered
sufficient for identification of inhibitors in high throughput screens
(38). The inhibitory activity of compounds identified by the
superquenching assay could be corroborated by the conventional
radio-gel assay and by the PiColorlock colorimetric assay.
The chemical library of polysubstituted piperidines proved
a relatively rich source of inhibitory compounds. Noticeably,
the three most active compounds contain a paranitrophenyl
hydrazine substituent on the ring nitrogen of the six-membered
piperidine ring, as well as an N-phenyl imide unit (Fig. 2). The
importance of these substituents to the binding of the inhibitor to
PNKP remains to be determined through further structure-activity
relationship studies. The library features less chemical diversity
at the position of the N-phenyl imide, which could be the target
of future structure-activity optimization. A12B4C3 was clearly
the most effective inhibitor of PNKP with an IC50 of 0.06 Amol/L
compared with f0.3 Amol/L for the next most active compound
A6B4C3 (Fig. 4C). In addition to the paranitrophenyl hydrazine
substituent, A12B4C3 also features a long hydrophobic alkyl chain,
which may at least be partly responsible for the greater inhibitory
activity displayed by this compound. However, as seen from the
structures of the active compounds shown in Fig. 2, all the
compounds have different substituents at this position, suggesting
that this site may be less critical and consequently it could be a
potential site for bioconjugation required in radiolabeling and
mechanistic studies.
An important issue with all small molecule inhibitors is their
specificity. We examined the response of a number of other
phosphatases to A12B4C3. Phage T4 polynucleotide kinase and
hPNKP share similar nucleic acid kinase and phosphatase

www.aacrjournals.org

activities. However, with the exception of the enzyme active
sites, the proteins bear no recognizable homology (26, 28). The
phosphatase domains of both proteins belong to the haloacid
dehalogenase superfamily (26, 39, 40) with a conserved DxDGT
motif, where the first Asp forms a covalent phospho-aspartate
intermediate with the substrate. The fact that A12B4C3 poorly
inhibited T4 polynucleotide kinase (Table 1) suggests that the small
molecule does not directly interact with this conserved haloacid
dehalogenase motif. The catalytic domain (phosphatase and
kinase) of S. pombe PNKP, on the other hand, shares considerably
more structural similarity with hPNKP than the T4 enzyme, with
127 identical residues, including the haloacid dehalogenase motif
(31). Despite this level of sequence overlap, the inhibition of
S. pombe PNKP by A12B4C3 was very limited (f30%), even at
50 Amol/L inhibitor concentration (Table 1), suggesting that the
compound interacts primarily with a region specific to mammalian
PNKP, hence the strong inhibition of human and mouse PNKP
(Table 1). Because A12B4C3 also inhibits the kinase activity of
hPNKP (Fig. 5B), it is possible that the compound acts as a
noncompetitive inhibitor disrupting the structure of the enzyme.
Indeed, preliminary evidence suggests that this is the case.6.
Given the low level of inhibition of related polynucleotide
kinases/phosphatases, it is not surprising that A12B4C3 displayed
no inhibition (Fig. 5A) of either of the two protein phosphatases
tested, protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1) and calcineurin (protein
phosphatase 2B), which are important members of the eukaryotic
serine/threonine family involved in a broad range of signal
transduction pathways (41). Of course, we cannot rule out the
possibility that A12B4C3 interacts with other protein phosphatases
or indeed other enzymes, but our tests for radiosensitization by
A12B4C3 (Fig. 6B and C) indicated not only that the compound
effectively sensitized wild-type cells to ionizing radiation, but also
revealed that PNKP is most likely the cellular target for A12B4C3 in
human cells because it failed to sensitize the PNKP-deficient cells.
In summary, we have made use of several analytic approaches to
identify a set of polysubstituted piperidine molecules that inhibit
mammalian PNKP in the Amol/L range and may prove to be useful
tools in the study of DNA repair. The most potent of these
compounds, A12B4C3, will serve as a useful lead compound for
future development of potential clinical radiosensitizers.
