and Alfonso Quintás-Cardama, MD3

The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has become an integral component of cancer therapy. Imatinib mesylate, a
breakpoint cluster region-Abelson BCR-ABL1 inhibitor, was the first TKI approved in cancer medicine and has served as
a model for the development of similar agents for other cancers. An important drawback of TKI therapy is the development of resistance, frequently through the acquisition of mutations. Mutations at the gatekeeper residues of BCR-ABL1
(eg, the threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at codon 315) and other oncogenic kinases have proven highly resistant to currently available TKIs. Advances in the structural biology of oncogenic kinases have facilitated the rational development

The Paradigmatic T315I Gatekeeper Mutation
Phosphorylation of specific serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues is germane to cellular growth, and its control relies on
the proper regulation of protein kinases. Protein kinases are plastic molecular switches that oscillate between ‘‘on’’ and
‘‘off’’ conformations according to diametrically opposite catalytical activity states.1 All protein kinases catalyze the transfer
of the c-phosphate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of serine, threonine, or tyrosine. To do so,
they must adopt a catalytically active ‘‘on’’ conformation, which involves changes in the orientation of the C helix in the
small N-terminal lobe and the activation area in the larger C-terminal lobe.2 Kinase activation in the wrong temporospatial context can result in unbridled cell proliferation and malignant transformation. Such is the case in chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML), a clonal malignancy characterized by unchecked myeloid proliferation driven by the constitutively active
kinase activity of the breakpoint cluster region/Abelson murine leukemia 1 (BCR-ABL1) fusion oncoprotein.1 The critical
role of BCR-ABL1 in the pathogenesis of CML is fueled the development of ATP mimetics capable of antagonizing its kinase activity. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can be divided in type I, which compete directly with ATP for the ATPbinding site, and type II, which not only bind to the ATP-binding site but also occupy an adjacent hydrophobic space
only accessible when the kinase is in its inactive conformation.3 The type II BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate
was the first TKI to be approved in cancer medicine and propelled the development of similar therapeutics for other cancer
types. After 8 years of follow-up in the phase 3 International Randomized Study of Interferon versus STI5711 (IRIS) trial,
imatinib therapy produced cumulative rates of complete cytogenetic response (ie, no evidence of the Philadelphia chromosome in the bone marrow) and major molecular response (ie, a BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio 0.1%) of 83% and 86%, respectively, among patients with CML in chronic phase (CP). These responses translated into event-free, progression-free, and
overall survival rates of 81%, 92%, and 85% (93% considering only CML-related deaths), respectively.4 Despite these remarkable results, it is estimated that 20% to 30% of patients eventually will develop resistance to imatinib, which, in
40%, will be associated with the acquisition of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations.5 Although >100 BCR-ABL1 point

mutations have been reported,1,6-11 those at residues
glycine 250 (Gly250), tyrosine 253 (Tyr253), glutamic
acid 255 (Glu255), threonine 315 (Thr315), methionine
351 (Met351), and phenylalanine 359 (Phe359) account
for >60% of all mutations.12 Most troublesome among
all mutations is the substitution of isoleucine (I) at the
315 position of the ABL1 kinase for threonine (T315I).
Thr315 is known as the gatekeeper residue, because it
maps to the periphery of the nucleotide-binding site of
ABL1.1 T315I is associated with an overall survival of 22
months in patients with CML-CP.13 Second-generation
TKIs, such as nilotinib and dasatinib, when used in patients
who have CML that is resistant to imatinib, produce complete cytogenetic response rates of 45% to 50%.14,15 Notwithstanding their remarkable activity against most BCRABL1 mutants, neither nilotinib nor dasatinib is active in
patients who carry the T315I mutation,14,15 supporting
the notion that this mutation represents an important
escape mechanism for CML cells withstanding high levels
of selection pressure imposed by TKI therapy.
Why Is T315I (and, for That Matter, Any
Gatekeeper Mutation) So Difficult to Target
With ATP-Mimetic TKIs?
Structural studies have demonstrated that the location of
the Thr315 residue plays a big role.16 Thr315 locates at
the periphery of the nucleotide-binding site of ABL1
kinase within the hinge region of the enzymatic cleft, stabilizes imatinib binding through hydrogen-bond interactions, and regulates access to a deep hydrophobic pocket
in the active site.1,7 It is noteworthy that, although imatinib and nilotinib bind BCR-ABL1 kinase in the inactive
conformation and dasatinib does so in the active conformation, all 3 TKIs make a critical hydrogen bond with
the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr315.1,17,18 A mutation of the threonine gatekeeper residue to isoleucine
prevents the formation of this critical hydrogen bond.
Second, such mutation also causes steric hindrance
between the large hydrophobic isoleucine residue and
any of the 3 TKIs, thus blocking the access of the latter
to the hydrophobic pocket in the proximity of
Thr315.16 Third, Thr315 participates in a network of
hydrophobic interactions when the kinase is in the
active conformation. Its mutation to isoleucine promotes the assembly of an enzymatically active kinase
conformation through the stabilization a series of
hydrophobic interactions.2,19 Consequently, T315I
results in complete insensitivity to imatinib, nilotinib,
dasatinib, and bosutinib.16,17,20-24

Is It Possible to Target BCR-ABL1T315I With an
ATP-Competitive Small Molecule?
In recent years, a series of dual inhibitors of BCR-ABL1T315I
and Aurora kinases have been tested in clinical trials,
including MK-0457,25 danusertib (PHA-739538),26,27
and XL-228.28 Unfortunately, their administration involved
inconvenient intravenous infusions, and responses were limited and typically short-lived, coinciding with the periods of
drug administration. Furthermore, all of these agents have
been associated with very high rates of grade 3/4 cytopenia
and with significant nonhematologic toxicities from their
activity against both malignant cells and normal cells,
because Aurora kinases are involved in normal cell signaling. Interest in developing T315I inhibitors has been reignited with the irruption of ponatinib (AP24534) into the
clinical arena (Table 1). The TKI ponatinib is obtained
through a structure-guided drug-design strategy aimed at
targeting the inactive conformation of the ABL1 kinase
and at avoiding the interaction with the side chain of
315I.29 Ponatinib potently inhibits both native (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50], 0.37 nM) and T315I
(IC50, 2.0 nM) ABL1 kinases in addition to multiple
BCR-ABL1 mutations that confer high levels of resistance
to other TKIs, SRC family of kinases, vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1,
and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinases, but not Aurora kinases.30 A structural analysis
of the cocrystal structure of the ponatinib analog AP24589
with BCR-ABL1T315I indicated that the ability of ponatinib
to inhibit the gatekeeper mutation resides in its slender, linear, triple-carbon ethynyl linker, which 1) prevents direct
contact with the isoleucine residue and 2) promotes an
extended conformation of the unbound inhibitor that favors
binding to the inactive conformation that T315I adopts.29
We have conducted in silico molecular simulations
that have confirmed the ability of ponatinib to bind in a
highly efficient manner to the T315I mutant isoform of
BCR-ABL1 by virtue of its ethynyl linker, which minimizes steric clash with the bulky isoleucine residue (Fig. 1ac). Indeed, ponatinib derivatives with altered ethynyl linkers exhibit a markedly diminished activity against T315I in
cellular assays, thus highlighting the tremendous importance of this region of the molecule in avoiding the steric
hindrance posed by the mutant isoleucine residue.29 In
cell-based mutagenesis screens, ponatinib completely abrogated the emergence of resistant CML clones at concentrations 40 nM in cell-based mutagenesis screens and
prolonged the survival of mice previously injected intravenously with Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL1T315I.30 In a

Highlights of the interaction of (b) imatinib and (c) ponatinib with the mutant residue I315 of BCR-ABL are shown. Note the difference
in steric clash (portrayed as colored areas), accounting for the preserved affinity of ponatinib for the mutant protein with respect to
the binding failure of imatinib. (d) A computer simulation is shown of ponatinib bound to the BCR-ABL2 T315I/phenylalanine-to-leucine mutation at codon 317 (BCR-ABL1T315I/F317L) double mutant. The mutant residues I315 and L317 are depicted as red and yellow
sticks, respectively. Drug hydrogen atoms, water molecules, and counterions are omitted for clarity. Ponatinib inhibits BCR-ABL1T315I/
F317L
with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 21 nM, which is 2.8-fold greater than the IC50 of BCR-ABL1T315I (7.4 nM).

recently completed phase 1 study, ponatinib was administered orally at doses ranging from 2 to 60 mg daily to 74
patients, including 60 patients with CML (44 in CP, 7 in
accelerated phase, and 9 in blastic phase), 4 patients with
BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),
and 10 patients with other myeloid malignancies. Of the
64 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia, 95% had failed at least 2 TKIs (65% had failed at
least 3 TKIs), and 63% carried at least 1 BCR-ABL1
mutation, including the T315I mutation in 28% of
patients.31 The dose-limiting toxicity was pancreatic,
which was reported in 4 of the 12 evaluable patients who
received 60 mg daily. The most frequent grade 3/4 treatment-related, nonhematologic toxicities were thrombocytopenia (16%), neutropenia (7%), and elevation of lipase
(7%), but only 4% of patients discontinued ponatinib
therapy because of toxicity. Doses >30 mg daily consistently rendered plasma concentrations that were predicted

vitro (>40 nM).31 Among patients with CML-CP, the
complete cytogenetic response rate was 53% (89% in
patients with T315I), and the major molecular response
rate was 42% (78% in patients with T315I), and most
responses were maintained after 12 months of followup.31 These results, although preliminary, are remarkable
and, if confirmed in an ongoing phase 2 study, will establish ponatinib as the drug of choice for patients who carry
the T315I mutation. Furthermore, it is known that
patients who fail sequential TKI therapy accumulate more
than 1 BCR-ABL1 mutation within the same malignant
clone, and it has been demonstrated that this increases
their oncogenicity.10,32 In addition to single point
mutants, our in silico experiments also demonstrated that
ponatinib binds with high affinity several double mutant
isoforms of this protein, mainly by virtue of substantially
reduced steric clashes and preserved favorable interaction
with the mutant residues as well as other amino acids lining the drug binding site (Fig. 1d). A recently published

drug-resistance screen with AP24163, a TKI related to
ponatinib, using randomly mutagenized BCR-ABL1T315I,
indicated that compound mutations involving T315I still
can be recovered.33 However, structural analyses of some of
the most frequently encountered compound mutants identified in patients with imatinib-resistant CML who were
treated at our institution in complex with ponatinib have
indicated that ponatinib is able to bind to all double-mutant BCR-ABL1 isoforms with IC50 values that, although
several-fold higher compared with the single point
mutants, can be reached easily at 45 mg daily, the dose currently being tested in phase 2 studies.
Are There Alternative Ways to Inhibit
Gatekeeper Mutations With TKIs?
Alternate ways to inhibit BCR-ABL1 kinase activity while
avoiding a direct interaction with the T315I gatekeeper
mutation have been reported. One of the most attractive
methods is that of targeting hydrophobic pockets remote
from the catalytic domain, where classic TKIs clash with
gatekeeper mutant residues. DCC-2036, which is in a
novel TKI class known as switch pocket inhibitors, is
undergoing clinical testing in a phase 1 study for patients
who carry T315I or who have failed >2 TKIs. DCC2036 is a multikinase inhibitor that binds to a pocket that
governs the transition between the active and the inactive
states of ABL1, thus locking the kinase into its inactive
state through a non-ATP-competitive mechanism.34 It

296

has been reported that gatekeeper mutants also can be
inhibited by perturbing the flexibility of the P-loop.35
Alternatively, T315I kinase potentially may be inhibited
by binding to the autoregulatory allosteric myristate cleft
at the N-terminus of ABL1, rendering a similar net effect
of freezing the kinase in its inactive state in a selective,
non-ATP-competitive manner.36 Such is the mechanism
of action of GNF-2, although this compound does not inhibit T315.36 However, the GNF-2 analog GNF-5
reportedly synergizes in vitro with nilotinib and imatinib
to inhibit T315I.37 Both DCC-2036 and GNF-5 represent attractive options that warrant clinical testing in
patients with highly resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations; but,
ultimately, these novel agents for the treatment of CML
resistant to conventional TKI therapies provide conceptual experimental templates that can be adapted to the
development of targeted agents for highly resistant
mutants driving the growth of other malignancies. In
addition to TKIs, 2 other alternatives to the treatment of
patients with CML who carry the T315I mutation are
available: First, omacetaxine, a semisynthetic alkaloid
with putative activity against CML stem cells,38,39 has
demonstrated ability to induce cytogenetic and complete
cytogenetic response rates of 41% and 18%, respectively,
among patients with CML-CP who carry the T315I
mutation.40 Second, allogeneic stem cell transplantation
can induce a complete molecular response, particularly in
patients with CML-CP.41

What Are the Implications of These Advances
in CML?
Gatekeeper mutations represent a common mechanism of
escape for cancer cells to overcome the selection pressure
imposed by effective TKIs. Prime examples of the latter
are the PDGFR threonine-to-isoleucine or methionine
mutation at codon 315 (PDGFRT674I/M) in hypereosinophilic syndrome,42 the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) threonine-to-methionine mutation at codon 790
(EGFRT790M) in nonsmall cell lung cancer,43-45 and the
v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene
homolog (KIT) threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at
codon 670 (KITT670I) in gastrointestinal stromal
tumors.46 Experimental modeling of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) kinase gatekeeper mutations suggest that this may also be a
mechanism of TKI resistance in cancer cells driven by mutant BRAF kinase.47 Similar to CML, gatekeeper mutations in these cancers typically are detected in patients
who develop TKI resistance after an initial response to
treatment. The development of ponatinib exemplifies
how drug design driven by meticulous structural analyses
can render compounds that override the hurdles imposed
by gatekeeper mutations. An alternative approach is that
of using functional pharmacologic screens of large libraries of small molecule inhibitors guided by molecular
modeling predictions.48 By means of such an approach, a
covalent, irreversible, pyrimidine EGFR inhibitor with
30-fold to 100-fold greater potency against EGFRT790M
compared with native EGFR recently was identified.48 It
has been reported that a novel class of ATP-competitive
TKIs led by HG-7-85-01 is capable of inhibiting BCRABL1T315I, KITT670I, and PDGFRT674I/M gatekeeper
mutations because of its ability to accommodate both the
native gatekeeper threonine as well as the abovementioned hydrophobic mutant residues. Certainly, the
prospect of a universal gatekeeper mutation inhibitor is
attractive: however, is it realistically possible? The surface
comparison of distinct tyrosine and serine-threonine
kinases has revealed a set of 30 residues with highly conserved spatial positions associated with similar patterns of
protein kinase activation.2 This high level of conservation
across different kinases involved in cancer development
may unveil a vulnerability that could be therapeutically
exploited. After all, the development of a gatekeeper
mutation is a rather predictable (conserved?) process arising in cancer cells driven by oncokinases exposed to high
levels of selection pressure by effective TKIs. The process
customarily involves the substitution of an isoleucine or a

Cancer

January 15, 2012

methionine residue by the native gatekeeper residue. This
remarkably narrow repertoire of substitutions at the gatekeeper position has furnished structural biologists and
chemists the opportunity to design and synthesize compounds, such as ponatinib or HG-7-85-01, versatile
enough to avoid the structural constraints imposed by the
gatekeeper mutants.
Lessons Learned and Unsolved Questions
Although nilotinib and dasatinib have proven more efficacious than imatinib as frontline therapy for CML-CP, a
subset of patients will continue to fail therapy, which, in
many patients, will be associated with the acquisition of
BCR-ABL1 mutations, including T315I. Ponatinib is an
oral TKI that reportedly produced high rates of cytogenetic and molecular response with a favorable toxicity profile in a phase 1 study of patients who were resistant to
multiple TKIs and/or who carried the T315I mutation. It
appears that, almost 1 decade after the initial description
of this gatekeeper mutation, an efficacious, safe, oral TKI
finally will be clinically available. However, several questions still linger: First, what will be the role of ponatinib?
Given its remarkable activity in patients with multi-TKIresistant CML, it is reasonable to believe that its activity
will be even greater as frontline therapy and perhaps
superior to nilotinib or dasatinib. Second, will the use of
ponatinib in the frontline setting prevent the clinical
emergence of BCR-ABL1 mutants? The in vitro characterization of this agent appears to suggest that possibility.
However, it is uncertain whether alternative mechanisms
of resistance will become more relevant, such as the development of complex compound BCR-ABL1 mutations or
mutations in tumor suppressors (eg, p53, ARF [an alternate reading frame product of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A locus], and p16). In that regard, it
must be emphasized that, despite the remarkable preliminary activity demonstrated by ponatinib, a significant
proportion of patients with the T315I mutation fail to
respond appropriately to ponatinib, probably because of
the coexistence of an alternative mechanism of resistance. Third, could ponatinib improve the outcomes of
patients with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL? This may be
possible given its high potency against native BCR-ABL1
kinase, its mild toxicity profile, and its activity against
T315I, a mutation that is particularly prevalent in
patients with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL who fail TKI
therapy. Finally, can ponatinib cure patients with newly
diagnosed CML-CP? It is both tantalizing and naı̈ve, in
equal measure, to believe so.
