Abstract
While a small number of plasma membrane ABC transporters can export chemotherapeutic drugs and confer drug resistance, it is unknown whether these transporters are expressed or
functional in less therapeutically tractable cancers such as
Group 3 (G3) medulloblastoma. Herein we show that among
this class of drug transporters, only ABCG2 was expressed at
highly increased levels in human G3 medulloblastoma and a
mouse model of this disease. In the mouse model, Abcg2
protein was expressed at the plasma membrane where it functioned as expected on the basis of export of prototypical
substrates. By screening ABC substrates against mouse G3

medulloblastoma tumorspheres in vitro, we found that Abcg2
inhibition could potentiate responses to the clinically used
drug topotecan, producing a more than 9-fold suppression of
cell proliferation. Extended studies in vivo in this model conﬁrmed that Abcg2 inhibition was sufﬁcient to enhance antiproliferative responses to topotecan, producing a signiﬁcant
survival advantage compared with subjects treated with topotecan alone. Our ﬁndings offer a preclinical proof of concept
for blockade of ABCG2 transporter activity as a strategy to
empower chemotherapeutic responses in G3 medulloblastoma. Cancer Res; 75(18); 3879–89. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

tine, and cisplatin, but recurrent tumors are further treated with
topotecan (1).
Recent studies identiﬁed four major molecular subgroups of
medulloblastoma: WNT, SHH, Group 3 (G3), and Group 4 (G4),
each of which responds differently to the current therapeutic
regimen (1–3). Human G3 medulloblastomas are characterized
by overexpression of the c-MYC (MYC) oncogene, with ampliﬁcation of the gene in about 17% of cases, and large cell/anaplastic
tumor histology. Overall, human G3 medulloblastomas have the
worst prognosis and are the most difﬁcult to treat (1). Two mouse
models that recapitulate human G3 medulloblastomas were
recently developed (4, 5). Our mouse model was generated by
orthotopic transplantation of granule neural progenitors (GNP)
isolated from the cerebella of 5- to 7-day-old Trp53/;Cdkn2c/
mice in which Myc is overexpressed by retroviral gene transfer (4).
Murine G3 medulloblastoma tumor cells grow as tumorspheres
that can be passaged indeﬁnitely in culture and form secondary
medulloblastoma similar to the primary tumors when transplanted into the cortices of na€ve recipient animals, therefore
providing a unique opportunity to test novel therapies (4).
ATP-binding cassettes (ABC) transporters are specialized membrane proteins (localized to either plasma membranes or membranes of intracellular organelles) that use ATP hydrolysis to move
diverse substances across biologic membranes (6). Within the
mouse, ABC transporters comprise 48 distinct proteins arranged
within families on the basis of sequence and organization of their
ATP-binding domain(s) (7). Some plasma membrane ABC transporters export an array of structurally diverse cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, thereby reducing cytotoxicity. ABCB1, ABCC1, and
ABCG2 are among the most highly studied drug-exporting ABC
transporters, perhaps because they were ﬁrst identiﬁed secondary
to their overexpression in cells that, after sustained chemotherapeutic drug exposure, acquired strong resistance to multiple

Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric
brain tumor arising in the posterior fossa. Current treatment that
cures about 80% of patients includes resection, radiation, and
chemotherapy (1). However, patients who survive often suffer
long-term sequelae due to the toxicity of the current therapy.
While chemotherapeutic regimens vary amongst treatment centers, current therapy is tailored on the basis of patient's age at
diagnosis, tumor histology, presence of metastasis, and, most
recently, molecular subgroup. The current chemotherapeutic regimen for medulloblastoma includes cyclophosphamide, vincris-

drugs. These changes in ABC transporter expression might impact
therapeutic response. Expression of some ABC transporters can be
modulated, either up or down, by oncogenic changes within
tumor cells (8–11). Recent studies have directly linked either
MYC or MYCN transcriptional activation in neuroblastoma to
the upregulation of ABCC1, ABCC4, and ABCG2 (12–14). Unexpectedly, ABCB1 was not a direct MYC target, suggesting that its
upregulation is indirect (12). Despite this knowledge that MYC,
directly or indirectly, regulates ABC transporters, it is unknown
whether the therapeutic response of tumors with increased MYC
expression is impacted by ABC transporter expression.
Because of the aforementioned poor prognosis and treatment
difﬁculties with human G3 medulloblastoma, we hypothesized
that overexpression of ABC transporters might provide a potential
mechanism for the failure of some current chemotherapy treatments (15–17). We here report that ABCG2 could be, in part,
responsible for the resistance of G3 medulloblastoma to current
therapy.

antibody to b-actin (1:2,000; clone AC-13, Sigma-Aldrich) was
used as control.
ABC transporter localization
Cell surface proteins were biotinylated with non-cell-impermeable biotin sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido) ethyl-1, 3dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin), as described earlier
(20). The surface biotinylated proteins were captured on streptavidin agarose beads and immunoblot analysis performed on total
lysates, streptavidin-captured surface proteins, as well as the
supernatants. The plasma membrane levels of the proteins were
represented as percentage of total input protein used in the pulldown assay, and transferrin receptor was used as internal control
for plasma membrane proteins. Brieﬂy, tumorspheres were rinsed
with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 10 mmol/L EZ-Link sulfoNHS-SS-biotin solution in PBS (pH 8.0; Pierce) for 30 minutes at
room temperature. Unreacted biotin molecules were quenched
with ice-cold PBS containing 100 mmol/L glycine for 10 minutes
before cell lysis and streptavidin agarose capture.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Medulloblastoma cells and GNPs were puriﬁed by Percoll
density gradient from primary mouse G3 medulloblastoma (4)
and from the cerebella of 7-day-old Trp53/;Cdkn2c/ mice,
respectively, and cultured as neurospheres, as described previously (4). MB#689 (Myc1) MB# 15486 (Myc2), MB# 9728 (Myc3),
and MB# 9730 (Myc4) are tumorsphere lines derived from two
independently arisen mouse G3 medulloblastoma. All mouse G3
medulloblastoma tumor cells were puriﬁed from tumors growing
into the cortices of mice. Primary tumor lines were tested for their
ability to recapitulate G3 medulloblastoma when reinjected into
the brain of na€ve recipient mice. Tumors were subjected to
Affymetrix gene chip array to conﬁrm that they were G3 tumors.
MB# 2416 (Myc1-luc) is a tumorsphere line derived from Myc1
infected with a virus coexpressing luciferase and the yellow
ﬂuorescent protein (YFP; pCL20-SF2-Luc2a-YFP). Murine erythroleukemia cells (Mel) were cultured, as previously described
(18). The Mel cell line was a gift from Paul Ney (formerly at St.
Jude) and has been maintained at low passage and has not been
tested. Bone marrow was isolated from the femur of Abcg2-null
mice bred in our facility, as described previously.
Microarray gene analysis
Microarray data were extracted from microarray datasets deposited with the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and designated with the following accession numbers: Mouse Affymetrix
chip (HT430PM), GSE33200 and Human Affymetrix chip
(U133v2), GSE37418.
Immunoblotting
Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the following primary antibodies: Abcc4 (puriﬁed
rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against mouse Abcc4 1:1,000;
ref. 19), Abcg2 (1:1,000; Abcam), Abcc1 (1:1,000), Abcb1 (puriﬁed rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against human ABCB1,
1:10,000), and transferrin receptor (1:10,000; Abcam). The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit (1:1,000; GE Healthcare). Proteins were detected by
chemiluminescence using reagents from Bio-Rad Laboratories. An

PMEA accumulation assay
Bis(POM)-PMEA accumulation was performed to assess
Abcc4 function, using mouse G3 medulloblastoma tumorspheres. Brieﬂy, single cells were resuspended in serum-free
media and incubated with Bis(pivaloyloxymethyl)-9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]-adenine [Bis (POM)-PMEA] (with a
trace amount of [3H] Bis (POM)-PMEA) at a ﬁnal concentration
of 10 mmol/L for 6 hours. Tumorspheres were treated with the
Abcc4 inhibitor MK571 (5–50 mmol/L) for 30 minutes before
adding PMEA. After 6 hours, tumorspheres were lysed with 0.5
mol/L NaOH, and the amount of radioactivity in the lysate was
measured by scintillation counting. Intracellular PMEA levels
were normalized to the protein concentration in the lysate
measured by Bradford assay.
Flow cytometric analysis of Abcg2 function and porphyrins
biosynthesis
Abcg2 function in mouse tumorspheres was measured by
Hoechst 33342 exclusion assays using FACS. In brief, cells were
incubated with either vehicle (DMSO) or 5 mmol/L fumitremorgin C (FTC; Enzo Life Sciences), an inhibitor of Abcg2, for 15
minutes at 37 C, followed by addition of vehicle or Hoechst
33342 (1 mmol/L). After 30 minutes of incubation with the dye,
cells were washed and resuspended in fresh media with or without
FTC for 1 hour at 37 C to allow efﬂux of Hoechst 33342. Cells
were washed and analyzed by FACS. For protoporphyrin IX
(PPIX) analysis, neurospheres were incubated with the PPIX
precursor, d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA;1 mmol/L) for 2 hours at
37 C, and intracellular PPIX levels were determined by FACS, as
previously described (21).
Drug screen for Abcg2 substrates
We performed a high-throughput screen of 12 chemotherapeutic drugs that are known ABCG2 substrates on the mouse G3
medulloblastoma Myc1 neurosphere, as previously described
(22). Brieﬂy, 1,000 cells per well were plated in 384-well plates.
After 24 hours, half of the plates were treated with 10 mmol/L of
FTC (Alexis Biochemical), 10 mmol/L of Ko143 (Tocris Bioscience), or 10 mmol/L of Tariquidar (Sigma-Aldrich), incubated for
30 minutes, and all plates were treated with 28 nL of compound in
a dose response (ﬁnal drug concentration, 9.3 mmol/L–0.5 nmol/L).

ABC Transporters in Group 3 Medulloblastoma

After 72 hours, the cell number was determined in each well
using CellTiter-Glo (Promega). The luminescence signal was
measured in an automated Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). Luminescence data were normalized by log10 transformation before calculating the percentage of inhibition using
the following equation: 100  (negative control mean 
compound value)/(negative control mean  positive control
mean). Cells treated with 1% DMSO served as negative control
with 0% inhibition. Cells treated with 35 mmol/L cycloheximide were used as positive control with 100% inhibition.

were the most highly expressed RNAs in human G3 medulloblastoma (Fig. 1A). Affymetrix gene chip array analysis of
puriﬁed tumor cells from 7 independently derived mouse G3
medulloblastoma and GNPs puriﬁed from the cerebella of four

Apoptosis measurement
A total of 5  105 mouse G3 medulloblastoma tumorspheres
were treated with 10 mmol/L FTC or/and 200 nmol/L topotecan for
24, 48, or 72 hours. Apoptosis was measured on 3  105 cells per
treatment condition stained with Annexin V (Pharmingen) and
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and analyzed by FACS.
In vivo efﬁcacy of topotecan in combination with an ABCG2
inhibitor, Ko143
A total of 1  105 mouse Myc1-luc tumorspheres were
implanted in the cortices of recipient CD-1 nude mice, as
previously described (4). For drug efﬁcacy studies, compounds
were injected intraperitoneally) in Myc1-luc–bearing mice 4
days posttumor implantation, when the luminescence signal
reached 5  105 photons. Ko143 (Tocris Bioscience) was
dissolved in saline at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL and
injected intraperitoneally at 10 mg/kg. Ko143 is the non-neurotoxic, but equally effective derivative of the speciﬁc ABCG2
inhibitor, FTC (23). Topotecan (Sigma) was prepared in saline
and injected intraperitoneally at 0.75 mg/kg. Control animals
received saline intraperitoneally. Tumor growth was monitored
by measuring bioluminescence, as previously described (4).
Mice displaying signs of morbidity including head dome, slow
moving, seizure, or >20% weight loss were euthanized, the
tumor removed, and ﬁxed in 10% formalin. Histopathology
was performed to determine tumor grade and presence of
necrotic area. All animal studies were conducted according to
the NIH guidelines and approved by the St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital Animal Care and Usage Committee.
Expression of Ki67, caspase-3, and Abcg2 by IHC
When animals were moribund, brains were collected and ﬁxed
in 10% formalin, sectioned in 4-mm sections, and immunostained
with antibodies to cleaved caspase-3 (CP229C, BioCare Medical;
1:500), Ki67 (TA-125-MH, ThermoShandon; 1:500), and Abcg2
(BXP53, Enzo Life Sciences; 1:10,000).
Topotecan plasma pharmacokinetics in the presence or absence
of Ko143
Pharmacokinetics studies for topotecan with and without
Ko143 were performed in nontumor-bearing mice and are
described in detail in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
ABC transporter expression in human and mouse G3
medulloblastoma
RNA expression of 48 ABC transporters was analyzed in
human G3 medulloblastoma using the Pediatric Cancer
Genome Project database (Supplementary Fig. S1A). These
were classiﬁed as either ABC transporters that transport drugs
or those with a deﬁned biologic function based upon knockout

mice of different litters revealed elevated RNA expression of 6 of
the 10 ABC transporters with consistently high expression of
Abcc4 and Abcg2 but much lower and more variable levels of
Abcb1 and Abcc1 in puriﬁed tumor cells compared with GNPs
(Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1B).
We conﬁrmed protein expression of three ABC transporters by
immunoblotting from total cell lysates from 5 independently
derived mouse G3 medulloblastoma neurospheres, Myc1-5
(Fig. 1C, lanes 1–5) and tumor chunks from three independently
derived mouse G3 medulloblastoma (Fig. 1C, lanes 6–8). Abcc4,
Abcg2, and Abcc1 proteins were expressed in all samples, with
the exception of Abcc1 with lower levels in Myc2 tumorspheres
(Fig. 1C, lane 2).
ABC transporters are functional in mouse G3 medulloblastoma
Protein expression of ABC transporters in tumor cell lysates
does not consider intracellular localization, an important consideration given ABC transporter plasma membrane localization
is affected by oncogenic signals (24). To investigate the localization of Abcc1, Abcc4, Abcg2, and Abcb1 in mouse G3 medulloblastoma–derived tumorspheres, we performed surface membrane biotinylation with non–cell-permeable NHS-SS-biotin, as

previously described (Fig. 2; ref. 20). We found that greater than
50% of total Abcc1 and Abcc4 were expressed at the plasma
membrane in Myc1 tumorspheres (Fig. 2A, left). In contrast, in
the same cells, we detected less than 12% of Abcg2 and 10% of
Abcb1 (Fig. 2A, right). We conﬁrmed the localization of Abcg2 by
IHC on Myc1 tumorspheres and found Abcg2 staining on the
plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. S2,
right).
We assessed the efﬂux function of Abcc4 by measuring PMEA
drug accumulation in the presence and absence of an Abcc4
inhibitor, MK571. Using 10 mmol/L of radiolabeled Bis (POM)
PMEA along with increasing concentrations of MK571 (5–50
mmol/L), we found radiolabeled PMEA accumulation increased
with the dose of MK571 (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results
further conﬁrm that in mouse G3 medulloblastoma tumorspheres, Abcc4 is localized to the plasma membrane and is
functional.
Abcg2 function was evaluated by measuring export of the
ﬂuorescent substrate, Hoechst 33342 using FACS analysis
(Fig. 2C and D). Mel cells were used as positive control
(Fig. 2C, top). Tumorspheres Myc1-luc and Myc2, incubated in
the presence of FTC, an Abcg2-speciﬁc inhibitor (23), accumulated

more intracellular Hoechst 33342 compared with tumorspheres
incubated with the Hoechst dye alone (Fig. 2C, middle and
bottom, respectively). These data were quantiﬁed as shown
in Fig. 2D.
Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), the ﬂuorescent penultimate precursor to heme, is a well-documented, speciﬁc endogenous ABCG2
substrate (21, 25), and tumors accumulate high levels of PPIX,
which might be due to either elevation of heme/porphyrin
biosynthetic genes or reduced expression of ABCG2. We evaluated
the RNA level of genes related to heme/porphyrin biosynthesis
(26, 27), in mouse G3 medulloblastomas and GNPs (Fig. 3A and
Supplementary Table S1). Mouse G3 medulloblastomas had
strong upregulation of this set of heme/porphyrin biosynthetic
genes. We tested whether these genes were functional by brieﬂy
incubating neurospheres with the PPIX precursor, ALA, followed
by FACS analysis to determine cellular PPIX concentrations (Fig.
3B and C; ref. 21). Mel cells incubated with ALA (Fig. 3B, top left),
tumorspheres Myc1 (Fig. 3B, bottom left), Myc1-luc (Fig. 3B, top
right), and Myc2 (Fig. 3B, bottom right) had increased PPIX mean
ﬂuorescence intensity compared with control. PPIX levels were
quantiﬁed in Fig. 3C. Inhibition of Abcg2, by FTC during the ALA
incubation, strongly increased the intracellular PPIX, indicating
that Abcg2 is highly functional in tumorspheres.

ABC transporters and in vitro drug resistance of mouse G3
medulloblastoma
Myc1 was treated with 12 chemotherapeutic drugs, known
ABCG2 substrates (18), in a dose response (1 nmol/L–10
mmol/L), with or without 10 mmol/L of the speciﬁc ABCG2
inhibitor FTC (Fig. 4A; ref. 23). Cell proliferation was measured
by CellTiter Glo 72 hours after addition of the drug. FTC either did
not or minimally changed (<3.5-fold) the EC50 value of 11 of the
chemotherapeutic drugs but enhanced the potency of topotecan
from 110 to 12 nmol/L when tumor cells were pretreated with FTC
(Table 1). A similar screen was performed on Myc1 neurospheres
with 10 mmol/L of Ko143 or Tariquidar (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Addition of Ko143 (green curves) or Tariquidar (red curves)
improved the potency of topotecan from 130 to 39 and 46
nmol/L, respectively. Similar results were observed for mitoxanthrone or methotrexate (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S2). Tariquidar had a more pronounced effect in
potentiating the chemotherapeutic drugs, which might be
explained by the fact that Tariquidar is a dual inhibitor of ABCG2
and Pgp (28).
The reduction in topotecan EC50 by CellTiter Glo values might
be due to either reduced proliferation or increased apoptosis. To
determine whether topotecan and FTC increased apoptosis of

mouse G3 medulloblastoma in vitro, Myc1 cells were treated with
10 mmol/L of FTC, followed by 10 nmol/L of topotecan. Cells were
pelleted 24, 48, or 72 hours after and analyzed for apoptosis by
annexin V staining followed by FACS analysis. Treatment with
FTC alone or topotecan alone did not increase apoptotis compared with control at 24 hours (Fig. 4B, green and blue bars,
respectively), but each compound appeared to produce a slight
increase in apoptosis at 48 or 72 hours, with a strongest effect for
topotecan as single agent. In contrast, topotecan and FTC treatment increased apoptosis, modestly at 24 hours and strongly at 48
or 72 hours (Fig. 4B, red bars).
ABCG2 inhibition increases topotecan cytotoxicity on mouse
G3 medulloblastoma in vivo
To determine the effect of inhibiting ABCG2 function on
topotecan plasma disposition, we used Ko143, as it is the non-

neurotoxic, but equally effective derivative of the speciﬁc ABCG2
inhibitor, FTC (23). We ﬁrst performed a study in nontumorbearing CD1 nude mice by intraperitoneal injection of topotecan
at a dosage of 0.75 mg/kg, as a single agent, or in combination
with 10 mg/kg of Ko143. Topotecan plasma concentration–time
proﬁles were well represented by a 2-compartment model. Topotecan was rapidly absorbed after intraperitoneal dosing, followed
by biphasic disposition (Fig. 5A and B). Pharmacokinetic parameters representing plasma disposition of topotecan are listed in
Supplementary Table S3. We found no signiﬁcant difference (P ¼
0.837) in topotecan plasma exposure when it was administered as
a single agent or in combination with Ko143 (Fig. 5C).
To determine how efﬁcacious topotecan and the ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143 were in suppressing proliferation of mouse G3 medulloblastoma in vivo, we stereotactically transplanted 1  105

cells (Myc1-luc) in the cortices of na€ve recipient mice. We
previously determined that this number of tumor cells induced
medulloblastoma that kill the animals within 15 days posttransplant and that the resulting tumors faithfully recapitulate the
primary tumors (4, 22).
The topotecan schedule and dosage for the efﬁcacy study was
determined on the basis of data published by Thompson and
colleagues (29), simulation of plasma exposure from previous
pharmacokinetic studies in mice (30), and optimal topotecan
exposure required for treatment of patients with pediatric
medulloblastoma (31). The dosing regimen of topotecan used
in the present study of 0.75 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally daily for 5 d/wk for 2 consecutive weeks was estimated to
produce, after a single dose, a topotecan plasma exposure
similar to that reported in pediatric patients (140 ng/mL h;
ref. 31). Tumor development was measured by luminescence
imaging (Fig. 6A). Mice bearing mouse G3 medulloblastoma
line Myc1-luc were treated by intraperitoneal injections of
topotecan at 0.75 mg/kg, Ko143 at 10 mg/kg, or the combination of both drugs 5 d/wk, 2 weeks in a row (Fig. 6A and B).
When combined, administration of Ko143 was given 30 minutes before topotecan to allow Ko143 to take effect before
topotecan treatment.
The in vivo sensitivity of mouse G3 medulloblastoma to
topotecan has not been previously reported. As single agents,
both topotecan and Ko143 restrained tumor growth (Fig. 6A).
The combination of topotecan and Ko143 strongly suppressed
tumor growth. Log transformation of the G3 medulloblastoma
growth curves revealed that the rate of tumor expansion was
profoundly reduced more than 240% when topotecan was
combined with Ko143 (Fig. 6A, insert). In contrast, treatment
with topotecan or Ko143 alone only modestly reduced the rate
of tumor expansion compared with control by approximately
24% (Fig. 6A).
As expected, mice treated with saline only survived 17 days after
transplant (Fig. 6B). While not statistically signiﬁcant, Ko143treated mice increased survival from 17 to 20 days. Topotecan
alone increased survival of the treated mice by 7 days, from 17 to
24 days. Treatment of mice with topotecan and Ko143 had an 11day increased survival (from 17 to 28 days) compared with salinetreated animals (Fig. 6B). Mice tolerated the treatments well and
we saw no changes in their weight regardless of the regimen used
(Supplementary Fig. S4A).

www.aacrjournals.org

We measured the mitotic index by immunostaining of tumors
from animals treated with Ko143, topotecan, or both drugs
together with antibodies to Ki67 to measure proliferation (Fig.
6C and D) and caspase-3 to measure apoptosis (Fig. 6E and F).
Tumors from animals treated with Ko143 alone had a high
mitotic index (91%  2.54%) and few areas of active caspase-3
(6%  2.1%), which is similar to tumors from vehicle-treated
animals (mitotic index, 5.2%  1.22%, caspase-3, 85.03% 
2.52%). In contrast, tumors from mice treated with topotecan
alone displayed a decrease in mitotic index (77%  10.6%) and a
slight increase in caspase-3 staining (12%  2.1%). Tumors from
animals treated with both drugs shared the same mitotic index as
the topotecan-treated tumors (76%  9.8%) but displayed almost
a 3-fold increase in caspase-3 staining (33%  16.1%, P ¼
0.0319).
Topotecan therapy might only eradicate tumors that express
ABCG2. To determine whether topotecan therapy affected Abcg2
protein levels in mouse G3 medulloblastoma, tumors were isolated from moribund animals and immunoblotting performed
on total cell lysates (Fig. 6G and H). Abcg2 expression was similar
among the mice treated with vehicle, Ko143, or topotecan. The
combination of topotecan and Ko143 treatment appeared to
increase Abcg2 expression but not signiﬁcantly. Abcg2 expression
was conﬁrmed by IHC on tumors from control or treated animals
(Supplementary Fig. S4B).

Discussion
We here report the expression and function of ABC transporters, ABCC4 and ABCG2, in G3 medulloblastoma. We
demonstrate that, among ABC transporters of drugs, ABCG2
RNA was highly expressed in both human and mouse G3
medulloblastoma and was functional by using a combination
of speciﬁc substrates and inhibitors. Screening of chemotherapeutic drugs that are known ABCG2 substrates with the
speciﬁc ABCG2 inhibitor, FTC (23), revealed that topotecan
was the most readily modulated in vitro. These studies were
extended in vivo to show that topotecan-induced apoptosis of
mouse G3 medulloblastoma increased when Abcg2 was speciﬁcally inhibited and suggested that Abcg2 expression might
account for the resistance of G3 medulloblastoma to chemotherapy regimens, especially those including drugs that are
substrates for ABCG2 like topotecan.

ABC Transporters in Group 3 Medulloblastoma

ABC transporter expression and function in G3
medulloblastoma versus other subgroups of medulloblastoma,
brain tumors, and other cancers
Since the identiﬁcation of the ﬁrst ABC transporter P-glycoprotein (Ppg/MDR1), a total of 48 ABC transporters have been
identiﬁed, found to be differentially expressed in multiple
tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS), with
increased expression of some related to increased resistance to
chemotherapy and radiotherapy (32). A RNA expression survey
demonstrated that of 10 recognized drug-transporting ABC
transporters in human G3 medulloblastoma, ABCC10, ABCC5,
ABCC1 (MRP1), and ABCG2 (BRCP) were the most highly
expressed, whereas in the mouse G3 medulloblastoma model,
Abcc4 and Abcg2 were consistently expressed and, to a lesser
extent, Abcc1 and Abcb1, but not Abcc10 or Abcc5. Cell surface
expression and functional efﬂux studies with speciﬁc inhibitors
identiﬁed Abcg2 and Abcc4 as the ABC transporters with
potential functional roles in chemotherapeutic resistance in
mouse G3 medulloblastomas. Because ABCG2 was the most
highly expressed in both mouse and human G3 medulloblastoma, it was of particular interest for therapeutic regimens that
might use its substrates.
Topotecan and G3 medulloblastoma
ABCG2, initially cloned from a drug resistant cell line that
did not express either ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) or ABCC1
(MRP1) protein (33), was subsequently found to be strongly
expressed at the apical membrane of polarized cells including
the blood–brain barrier (BBB), limiting penetration of some
drugs to the brain (34, 35). Previous studies showed, in tumor
cell lines, that ABCG2 conferred resistance to various chemotherapeutic drugs, including topotecan (36). However, established tumor cell lines do not always recapitulate ABC transporter expression and function in vivo (37). Topotecan treatment of mice harboring mouse G3 medulloblastoma enhanced
survival when Abcg2 was inhibited by the highly selective
inhibitor Ko143 (23). Strikingly, these in vivo ﬁndings extend
the in vitro results demonstrating that Abcg2 inhibition in G3
medulloblastoma tumorspheres enhanced both topotecaninduced apoptosis and suppression of proliferation. In mice,
topotecan treatment with the Abcg2 inhibitor, Ko143, was well
tolerated with no evidence of enhanced gastrointestinal toxicity
or weight loss (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Topotecan, an inhibitor of topoisomerase activity, is currently used in the treatment
of recurrent medulloblastoma (1, 38). However, the high
expression of ABCG2 in human G3 medulloblastomas suggests
that concurrent addition of a potent and selective inhibitor of
ABCG2, like Ko143, might be warranted to improve outcomes
to topotecan therapy without increasing toxicity.
The almost 3-fold increase in apoptosis of G3 medulloblastoma tumors in vivo, produced by the combination of topotecan and Ko143, is compatible with the suppression of
ABCG2-mediated export of topotecan. However, the salutary
effect of ABCG2 inhibition in vivo is complicated because
Ko143 can have an impact on ABCG2, both in the tumor and
in the BBB (39). However, we have previously demonstrated,
in a SHH intracranial transplant model, that the BBB is
compromised (40). Under these circumstances, Ko143 is likely
blocking tumor-catalyzed Abcg2-mediated export of topotecan. This interpretation is consistent with both the increased
tumor apoptosis in vivo and our ﬁndings in vitro showing

www.aacrjournals.org

Ko143 increased the topotecan sensitivity of G3 medulloblastoma cell 9-fold. Moreover, the overall reduction in Abcg2
expression in tumor samples posttreatment suggests that the
treatment of topotecan and Ko143 eradicates medulloblastoma-expressing Abcg2. While these ﬁndings suggest that this
combination therapy is efﬁcacious, it is unknown whether this
would be effective in the treatment of brain tumors because it
is unclear whether the integrity of the BBB is disrupted in all
children with medulloblastoma (41). Indeed, recent data suggest that the structure and function of the BBB varies markedly
among the various subtypes of medulloblastoma (Richard
Gilbertson, personal communication). Nonetheless, these
ﬁndings suggest more favorable outcomes with topotecan
might be achieved by inhibition of both BBB and ABCG2
function.
Surprisingly, in vitro cytotoxicity screening of the G3 medulloblastoma mouse line (Myc1) for sensitivity to a dozen
ABCG2 chemotherapeutic drug substrates (42) revealed that
tumor sensitivity, for a small subset of these drugs (i.e., mitoxantrone, topotecan, and methotrexate), was only enhanced
by the speciﬁc ABCG2 inhibitor, FTC (23). A variety of potential explanations might account for this unexpected ﬁnding,
including chemotherapeutic drug concentrations below the
afﬁnity of ABCG2 for its drug substrate. However, a simpler
explanation might be that another transporter highly expressed
at the plasma membrane in G3 medulloblastomas might also
transport these drugs, thereby accounting for the unanticipated
lack of a cure when ABCG2 was inhibited. ABCC4 is a good
candidate because it is functional and highly expressed in both
the cultured G3 medulloblastoma lines and the freshly isolated
tumors. ABCC4, originally identiﬁed as a nucleotide exporter
(43), was subsequently shown to confer resistance to a broader
range of chemotherapeutic substrates (e.g., camptothecins;
ref. 19). In addition, ABCG2 and ABCC4 have some similar
substrates (44). Among the ABCC4 substrates tested in the
tumorspheres were an antifolate (methotrexate; ref. 19), kinase
inhibitor (dasatinib; ref. 45), and camptothecin (topotecan).
Topotecan is readily transported by human and murine ABCC4
(19); thus, it is conceivable that a dual inhibitor, producing
combined inhibition of both ABCC4 and ABCG2, might yield
greater overall improvements in survival.
MYC, ABC transporters, and resistance to therapy
Some ABC transporters were previously shown to be overexpressed in primary human pediatric medulloblastoma (32),
but ABCG2 expression in human G3 medulloblastomas was
not evaluated. ABCG2 was of particular interest in G3 medulloblastoma because it is overexpressed in both mouse and
human tumors, is implicated as a cancer stem cell marker
(46), and is responsible for maintaining a nondifferentiating
state (47, 48). Furthermore, solid tumor cells harboring functional ABCG2 exhibit intrinsic properties such as pluripotency,
greater growth capacity, improved survival rate after cytotoxic
drug exposure, and enhanced tumorigenicity (49, 50). G3
medulloblastomas display stem cell behavior that is recapitulated in the mouse model, which might be one reason for its
resistance to current treatment. Indeed, mouse G3 medulloblastomas express several markers of stemness, including
Nestin and Sox2 (4). In addition, overexpression of MYC,
the hallmark of G3 medulloblastomas and MYCN in
recurrent SHH subgroup medulloblastoma, contributes to the

coordinated transcriptional regulation of a large set of ABC
transporters, including ABCG2 (12). Therefore, ABCG2 might
be added as a prognostic marker to identify potentially recurrent or aggressive medulloblastoma.

Conclusion
The identiﬁcation of ABCG2 as a potential factor of chemoresistance in G3 medulloblastoma suggests that potent and selective
inhibitors of ABCG2 could be used to improve response to
chemotherapeutic drug as substrates of ABCG2, including
topotecan.
