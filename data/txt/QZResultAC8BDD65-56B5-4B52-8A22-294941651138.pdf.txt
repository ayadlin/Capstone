Abstract
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for approximately 10% to 15% of breast carcinomas, and although it
responds poorly to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, it appears to respond well to endocrine therapy. Pre- and ontreatment (after 2 weeks and 3 months) biopsies and surgical samples were obtained from 14 postmenopausal
women with estrogen receptor–positive (ERþ) histologically conﬁrmed ILC who responded to 3 months of
neoadjuvant letrozole and were compared with a cohort of 14 responding invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC)
matched on clinicopathologic features. RNA was extracted and processed for whole human genome expression
microarray. Dynamic clinical response was assessed using periodic three-dimensional ultrasound measurements
performed during treatment and deﬁned as a reduction of >70% in tumor volume by 3 months. Pretreatment
proﬁles of ILC and IDC tumors showed distinctive expression of genes associated with E-cadherin signaling,
epithelial adhesion, and stromal rearrangement. The changes in gene expression in response to letrozole were
highly similar between responding ILC and IDC tumors; genes involved in proliferation were downregulated and
those involved with immune function and extracellular matrix remodeling were upregulated. However, molecular
differences between the histologic subtypes were maintained upon treatment. This is the ﬁrst study of molecular
changes in ILC in response to endocrine therapy to date. The genes that change on letrozole are highly consistent
between ILC and IDC. Differences in gene expression between ILC and IDC at diagnosis are maintained at each
time point on treatment. Cancer Res; 74(19); 5371–6. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for approximately 10% to 15% of newly diagnosed breast cancers (1, 2), affecting
roughly 30,000 women annually in the United States (2). ILC is
classically characterized by small, regular uniform neoplastic
cells that invade the stroma in a single-ﬁle pattern with cells
encircling normal breast tissue (1). Inactivation of E-cadherin
(CDH1) by a variety of molecular mechanisms is considered a
deﬁning characteristic of ILC. When compared with the more
common invasive breast cancers of no special type, also known
as invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC), ILC is more likely to be
estrogen receptor–positive (ERþ) and of lower nuclear grade
(3). ILC is often large at diagnosis and there have been
numerous reports on the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It was thought that patients with ILC are signiﬁcantly less
likely to have a pathologic complete response than patients

with IDC; however, a recent study concluded that ILC represents a heterogeneous group of tumors and the difference in
response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is largely explained by
differences in molecular characteristics, particularly hormone
receptor and HER2, and is independent of lobular histology (4).
ILC have been shown to respond well to endocrine therapy (2)
and we recently described the clinical response to neoadjuvant
letrozole in a series of 61 patients (3). The lack of understanding
of how lobular breast cancer responds to treatment is compounded by the paucity of research models (reviewed in ref. 2);
however, a very recent study suggested that E2 and antiestrogens differentially regulate ERa-mediated gene expression in ILC versus IDC cell lines and xenografts (5).
Previous microarray studies of ILC tumors have focused
on transcriptional differences between lobular and ductal
histology before treatment (6–10). To our knowledge, there
have been no previous studies on the molecular response to
endocrine therapy in ILC patient samples. We and others
have characterized the molecular response to endocrine
therapy in breast tumors in previous studies (11–13), but
have not previously considered the effects of histologic
subtype. Comparing pre- and posttreatment biopsies from
the same patients, using the "window of opportunity"
afforded with neoadjuvant therapy is a powerful approach
that can improve statistical power due to reducing patient–
patient variation (14). However, these studies are challenging to perform and are dependent on analyzing sufﬁcient
numbers of suitably appropriate samples.

Patients and Methods
Patients
Samples were selected from a consecutive series of 89
postmenopausal women presenting to the Edinburgh Breast
Unit (Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, United Kingdom)
between 2003 and 2011. Each had a large primary histologically
conﬁrmed invasive breast cancer, immunohistochemically
determined to be ERþ. All patients gave informed consent to
be included in the study that was approved by the local regional
ethics committee (2001/8/80 and 2001/8/81). Patients were
treated within a neoadjuvant protocol, in which letrozole
(Femara, 2.5 mg; Novartis Pharma AG) was given daily.

Tumor samples
Tumor biopsies were taken with a 14-guage needle before
and approximately 2 weeks (range, 10–19 days) and 3 months
(range, 86–142 days) following commencement of continuous
letrozole treatment as described previously (Fig. 1A). Samples
were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and frozen sections were
taken, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and the
cellularity and percentage presence of cancerous tissue within
each specimen were assessed by a pathologist. Two-week
samples were available only for 10 of the 14 patients with ILC.
Response assessment
Clinical response was determined using dynamic changes
in tumor volumes assessed by repeated measurements taken
over the 3-month treatment period. Primary assessment was
based on ultrasound measurements performed by a single

clinician (J.M. Dixon) and these were veriﬁed by mammographic measurements (Fig. 1A). Clinical response was deﬁned as a
reduction of greater than 70% in tumor volume by 3 months.
RNA processing and microarray hybridization
Biopsies were homogenized and RNA was extracted using
the RNeasy Mini Kit with RNAse-free DNAse treatment (Qiagen). RNA quantity and quality were veriﬁed on a Bioanalyzer
2100 with the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent) and Nanodrop
2000c (Thermo Scientiﬁc). RNA was reverse transcribed and
ampliﬁed using the WT-Ovation FFPE System Version 2
(NuGEN), puriﬁed using the Qiaquick PCR Puriﬁcation Kit
(Qiagen), biotinylated using the IL Encore Biotin Module
(NuGEN), puriﬁed using the minElute Reaction Cleanup Kit
(Qiagen) and quantiﬁed once again using the Nanodrop 2000c
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Labeled cDNA was hybridized to Human
HT-12v4 whole-genome expression bead arrays (Illumina)
according to the standard protocol for NuGEN ampliﬁed
samples. The Illumina data have been submitted to NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and are available under GSE55374.
Approximately half of the ILC and IDC samples were processed
on Affymetrix GeneChips within a previous study (12), these
are publicly available from NCBI GEO under GSE20181 and
identiﬁed in the Supplementary Data.
Data analysis
The llumina and Affymetrix data were independently preprocessed and re-annotated to Ensembl gene identiﬁers, then
combined and batch corrected as described previously (15).
Brieﬂy, Illumina probe proﬁles were quantile normalized using
the lumi package and mapped to Ensembl gene sequences
using reMOAT (16), BioMart, and a custom BLAST sequence
search. A custom Chip Deﬁnition File (CDF; ref. 17) was used to
map the Affymetrix data to Ensembl. The Affymetrix portion of
data was normalized by robust multi-array average method
implemented by the affy package. The datasets were ﬁltered
using detection P values, removing probes that were undetected (P > 0.05 in the total minus three samples). Both datasets
were then combined and batch corrected with cross-platform
normalization (XPN; ref. 18). A subset of samples was proﬁled
on both platforms and demonstrated successful minimization
of batch effects (15). Pretreatment tumors were assigned to
molecular subtypes using the Sorlie and colleagues centroids
(19) as described previously (15). Paired and unpaired Rank
Products analysis (20) was used to identify differentially
expressed genes and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was
performed with the phenoTest package. Functional gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID Bioinformatics
Resources 6.7 and the PANTHER Classiﬁcation System. Differences in clinicopathologic features and platforms between the
ILC and IDC samples were assessed with the x2 test.

Results
From a cohort of 61 patients with ILC treated with neoadjuvant letrozole (3), surgery was possible for 24 cancers after 3
months. Sufﬁcient quality and quantity of RNA for gene
expression proﬁling were available for matched pretreatment
and 3-month samples for 14 of these patients with ILC who had

patients with IDC that responded to letrozole. Patients were
matched for clinicopathologic features (Table 1) and response
(Fig. 1B) and the histopathologic status were conﬁrmed by a
pathologist (representative images Fig. 1C). Consistent with
previous studies (6–10), unsupervised hierarchical clustering
of the pretreatment samples using the 500 most variable genes
across samples at pretreatment was able to distinguish
between IDC and ILC with 86% accuracy (Fig. 1D).

Supervised analysis [Rank Products, percent false present

genes that have been highlighted in previous studies, including
E-cadherin (CDH1), osteopontin (SPP1), and epithelial cell
adhesion molecule (EPCAM). Similarly, many of the 136 genes

with signiﬁcantly higher expression in ILC than IDC have
previously been shown to distinguish between these histologic
subtypes (7–10), and include CAV1, AOC3, FAB4, VWF, TF,
CD36, EGR1, IER2, and PLIN1. Over half of the genes found to
be signiﬁcantly differentially expressed between the histologic
subtypes before treatment (including all of those highlighted)
were still signiﬁcantly differentially expressed after 3 months of
treatment (Fig. 2A and B). GSEA conﬁrmed consistency of the
gene lists before and after treatment (P < 0.0001). Therefore,
differences in gene expression between ductal and lobular
carcinomas are maintained during treatment, as illustrated
using multidimensional scaling of the 206 pretreatment genes
with time plotted on the third dimension (Fig. 2C).

pairwise Rank Products analysis (PFP, 0.05) for patients with
ILC and IDC. Over half of the changed genes were signiﬁcantly
up- or downregulated in both histologic subtypes. Figures 3A
and B clearly demonstrates that the molecular effects of
treatment are virtually uniform (even after just 2 weeks), in
the two subtypes, with the same genes up- and downregulated.
This result is somewhat at odds with a very recent study that
found that E2 and anti-estrogens differentially regulate ERamediated gene expression in ILC (MDA-MB-134VI and
SUM44PE) and IDC (MCF7, T47D, and BT474) cell lines (5).
However, we found that the "ILC-speciﬁc" and "IDC-speciﬁc"
genes identiﬁed in this study were not signiﬁcantly changed in
the clinical samples after neoadjuvant letrozole using GSEA to
compare the response between the histologic subtypes (Supplemental Data). Furthermore, none of the differentially regulated genes highlighted in ILC cell lines and represented in
our data (CA12, NEDD9, CXCL12, PDE4B, and NR3C2) were
signiﬁcantly differently regulated between ILC and IDC tumors
treated with letrozole (Supplemental Data). Perhaps not

surprisingly and consistent with previous studies (12, 13), the
genes that were most signiﬁcantly changed in response to
letrozole in both ILC and IDC tumors were characterized by
downregulation of proliferation and upregulation of ECM
remodeling and immune pathways (Fig. 3C).

Discussion
Our study shows for the ﬁrst time that the molecular
response to endocrine therapy in ILCs is highly similar to the
response in IDCs. This is somewhat surprising given that we
and others (7–10) have demonstrated clear molecular differences between tumors before treatment. The present
study demonstrates that these differences are maintained
during treatment. Stratiﬁed medicine seeks to identify
molecular differences between cancers that will allow targeted treatment with speciﬁc agents, yet although these
histologic subtypes of breast cancer are molecularly distinct,
both respond in a highly uniform way to endocrine therapy.
The consistent molecular changes in expression observed in
response to letrozole in both ILC and IDC contrast with a
recent study that found that E2 and anti-estrogens differentially regulate ERa-mediated gene expression in ILC and

www.aacrjournals.org

IDC cell lines (5). Although there are obvious possible
explanations for this apparent discrepancy, including different responses to alternative endocrine agents and the degree
to which a small number cell lines represent the molecular
heterogeneity of primary breast tumors, we believe that our
study demonstrates the value and need for performing
molecular studies in patient samples undergoing treatment,
rather than in cell lines. One of the possible reasons behind
the similar molecular response to treatment observed in
ILC and IDC in this study is that we selected only clearly
responsive tumors from both histologic subtypes.
Previous work from our group has suggested that there is
greater molecular diversity in the gene changes seen
between individual nonresponding tumors when treated
with aromatase inhibitors, whereas in responders the
changes are relatively homogeneous (12). Thus, the resistance mechanisms still may be different between the ILC and
IDC despite the similarities found in responding tumors in
the present study. We were unable to address this issue at
this time, as there were only two nonresponding lobular
tumors with microarray data and therefore they were not
included in this study. An extension of this study focused
on the different resistance pathways in nonresponding

tumors of different pathologic types may be possible in the
future if additional samples can be collected. However, we
have already recorded that some nonresponding tumors
have molecular changes similar to responders; notably,
reductions in estrogen-regulated and proliferation genes,
without a clear clinical response (21).
Although the number of patients in this study is relatively
modest, the ILC and IDC patient groups consist of cancers with
a consistently high Allred ER score of 7 or 8, all were luminal A
subtype, grade 2 or 3, and had similar responses to letrozole.
Relatively high numbers of genes were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed between the two subtypes, demonstrating
clear distinctions between these cancers that were maintained
at all time points. The study also supports the potential value of
cross-platform integration to generate larger datasets with
increased statistical power given that clinical samples are
relatively scarce.
In conclusion, we have performed the ﬁrst study of
molecular changes in ILC in response to endocrine therapy.
The genes that change on letrozole treatment are highly
similar in ILC and IDC although clear molecular differences
between the histologic subtypes are evident between these
two cancer types, and these differences are maintained on
treatment.
