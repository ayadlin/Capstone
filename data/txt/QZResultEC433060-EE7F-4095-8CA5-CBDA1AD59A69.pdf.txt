Abstract
We have investigated the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinases
(PI3Ks) in the in vitro pathophysiology of acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL) and in the response to treatment with
all-trans-retinoic-acid (ATRA), utilizing a range of novel
inhibitors that target individual or all catalytic class I
isoforms of PI3K (p110A, p110B, p110D, and p110;). ATRAinduced phosphorylation of the Akt kinase and ribosomal S6
protein in APL cells was sensitive to class I PI3K, and p110B or
p110D inhibitors, and to the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin. In primary APL, inhibition of
p110B or p110D triggered apoptosis in the absence or presence
of ATRA. Class I PI3K inhibition could also reverse ATRAinduced protection of these cells against doxorubicin and
arsenic trioxide, correlating with impaired induction of the
antiapoptotic MCL-1 protein. The differentiation-inducing
effects of ATRA were not dependent on class I PI3K/mTOR.
In summary, class I PI3K signaling, mediated by p110B and
p110D, plays an important role in basal and ATRA-induced cell
survival mechanisms in APL. Addition of PI3K inhibitors to
induction treatment regimens may provide therapeutic
benefit. [Cancer Res 2009;69(3):1027–36]

Introduction
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the M3 (FAB) subtype of
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), constitutes between 10% and 15%
of adult AML (1). APL cells typically carry a specific reciprocal
chromosome translocation, t(15;17), leading to the expression of
the PML-RARa fusion protein, which plays a key role in
pathogenesis. APL results from a deregulation in the process of
myeloid cell self-renewal and differentiation, and is characterized
by an accumulation of abnormal promyelocytes that fail to
differentiate into neutrophil granulocytes and that are resistant
to apoptosis (2). APL differentiation-based therapy using all-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA) has proven to be efficient at inducing
differentiation of leukemic cells and in combination with cytotoxic
chemotherapy dramatically improves the long-term survival of APL

patients (3). In addition to translocations involving RARa, APL
cases may have deregulated signaling via the FLT3 or RAS pathways
with a mutation rate of f40% (4) and 10% (5), respectively.
Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) catalyze the phosphorylation
at the 3¶ position of the inositol ring in phosphoinositide lipids
and control a variety of functions including proliferation, survival,
migration, and differentiation of many cell types. PI3K dysregulation is linked to the pathogenesis of several human diseases
including inflammatory disorders and cancer (6). Mammals have
eight distinct isoforms of PI3K, divided into three classes (7). The
class I catalytic subunits (p110a, p110h, p110g, and p110y) produce
the PIP3 lipid and are acutely activated by extracellular stimuli, and
signal downstream of Ras (7). Originally, a distinction was made
between class IA (p110a, h, y) and IB (p110g) subsets based on the
putative activation downstream of tyrosine kinases or G protein–
coupled receptors (GPCR), respectively (7). However, this distinction between class IA and IB PI3Ks has recently been blurred, given
the strong evidence for a key role of p110h downstream of GPCRs
(8). p110s are found in heterodimeric complexes with a regulatory
subunit, called p85 in the case of p110a, h, y, and p87/p101 for
p110g. Whereas p110a and p110h are ubiquitously expressed,
p110y and p110g are highly enriched in the hematopoietic system
(9, 10). A combination of genetic (8, 11, 12) and inhibitor-based
studies (13–15) have provided evidence for isoform-specific roles of
the distinct p110s. Activating mutations in catalytic PI3K subunits
have only been found for p110a (16), but overexpression of the
nonmutated forms of the other class I PI3K isoforms can cause
oncogenic transformation in avian cell model systems (17). PI3K
pathways can also be activated by loss-of-function of the negative
regulator PTEN, a lipid phosphatase that degrades PI3K lipids (18).
Interestingly, the frequency of mutations in PTEN and p110a in
hematologic malignancies is negligible (19, 20).3 It is possible that
the PI3K pathway is instead activated as a consequence of
oncogenic activation of upstream pathways (such as FLT3 and
RAS; refs. 4, 5), or by autocrine growth factor signaling (such as
insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I); refs. 21, 22).
Class I PI3K signaling leads to activation of the Akt serine/
threonine kinase. Akt is involved in the control of a number of
signaling modules and one of its key targets is the mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which regulates cell growth
and metabolism. mTOR belongs to a family of PI3K-related Ser/Thr
kinases and resides in two distinct signaling complexes, TORC1
and TORC2 (23–25). mTOR in the TORC1 complex is sensitive to
the actions of the drug rapamycin (26).
Until recently, only broad-spectrum PI3K inhibitors (such as
wortmannin and LY294002) were available, and use of these agents

in vivo is associated with significant toxicities (27). LY294002 not
only blocks PI3K but also inhibits mTOR and various other kinases.
Novel agents that selectively target PI3K isoforms have now been
generated (14). Using isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors for p110y,
we and others have reported that the constitutive activation of
PI3K/Akt signaling in primary AML cells is predominantly
attributable to p110y (28, 29). Pharmacologic inhibition of p110y
can inhibit proliferation and potentiate the apoptotic effect of
etoposide/VP16, without adverse effects on the biology of normal
hematopoietic progenitors (28, 29).
Here, we investigate the roles of PI3K isoforms in APL. Several
reports have provided evidence that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
plays a role in the induction of retinoic acid responses in
promyelocytic leukemic cells (30, 31). For example, Lal and
colleagues (31) showed that ATRA activates Akt and mTOR
pathways in the NB-4 APL cell line. Based on the observation that
ATRA-induced differentiation could be blocked by LY294002, it was
suggested that PI3K/mTOR inhibition could therefore compromise
the efficacy of retinoid therapy. In the last few years, a number of
reports have documented a broad range of inhibitory activities of
LY294002 beyond PI3K, calling into question some of the
conclusions reached in earlier studies utilizing this compound to
evaluate the role of PI3K (14, 32). In the present study, we used
novel selective class I PI3K inhibitors (Table 1), alone or in
combination with ATRA, to evaluate the effects of blocking PI3K
signaling on APL cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation,
using the NB-4 cell line and primary APL samples. We report that
class I PI3K inhibition blocked basal activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling and could reduce proliferation and induce apoptosis.
Treatment of APL cells with ATRA led to the activation of PI3K and
improved cell survival in the presence of cytotoxic agents such as
doxorubicin. This could be reversed by class I PI3K inhibitors
which, somewhat surprisingly, did not affect APL differentiation.
These results suggest that addition of PI3K inhibitors to induction
treatment regimens for APL might be of clinical value.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. PIK4, PI-103, LY294002, and rapamycin were obtained from
Calbiochem; TGX-155 and TGX-221 from Serono and Cayman, respectively;
and IC87114 and AS604850 from Serono. All inhibitors (Table 1) and ATRA
were dissolved in DMSO and stored at 20jC. ATRA, 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), doxorubicin, and arsenic trioxide were obtained

from Sigma. Sources of other reagents are as follows: polyclonal anti–T308pAkt, anti-S473-pAkt, anti–S235/236-pS6, anti-PTEN, anti–cleaved caspase-9,
anti–pro-caspase-9 and monoclonal anti-Akt antibodies (Cell Signaling
Technology), MCL-1 (sc-819; Santa Cruz), BCL-XL (sc-634; Santa Cruz),
monoclonal anti–Bcl-2 and caspase-3 antibodies (BD Biosciences), polyclonal anti-BIM (R & D Systems), monoclonal antibodies against h-actin and
a-tubulin (Sigma), monoclonal antibodies against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam), phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated polyclonal
antibodies against CD11b (DakoCytomation). Polyclonal anti-p110a antibodies were a gift from Calle Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research,
Uppsala, Sweden), polyclonal anti-p110h (sc-602; Santa Cruz) antibodies
were purchased from Santa Cruz, and polyclonal antibodies to p110y have
been described previously (9).
Cell culture. NB-4 cells, an established human APL cell line with t(15;17),
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin/
streptomycin. Patient APL samples from peripheral blood or bone marrow
were obtained from the UK AML tumor cell bank or from patients presenting
to University College Hospital, London. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients. Leukemic blasts were isolated by standard FicollHypaque density gradient centrifugation. All patient samples were used fresh
within 24 h of collection. Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 and 10% FCS
(RPMI/10% FCS). No exogenous cytokines were added. NB-4 and primary
APL cells were cultured in RPMI/10% FCS in the presence of vehicle
(DMSO), PIK4 (0.5 Amol/L), TGX-155/TGX-221 (0.5/1 Amol/L), IC87114
(5 Amol/L), AS604850 (1 Amol/L), PI-103 (0.5 Amol/L), Rapamycin (20 nmol/L;
ref. 31), LY294002 (25 Amol/L), ATRA (1 Amol/L), doxorubicin (0.5 Amol/L),
arsenic trioxide (1 mmol/L) in the indicated combination. The doses of drugs
used throughout the study are as above, unless otherwise indicated, and the
IC50 of each isoform-selective PI3K inhibitor are listed in Table 1.
Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and measurement of mitochondrial
membrane potential assays. Using a cell counter (Casy Model TT; Scharfe
System), NB-4 cell number from aliquots of time course experiments was
estimated after 72 h of continuous treatment. Cell proliferation/survival
assays using the CellTiter96 aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation kit
(Promega), which is based on the MTS (a tetrazolium compound)
colorimetric dye reduction, were performed as in previous studies (29).
The apoptosis assay based on Annexin V cell surface binding [flow
cytometric analysis of FITC-conjugated Annexin V expression and
propidium iodide (PI) exclusion] was carried out according to the
Manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences) and was performed as
previously described (29). For each assay, results were quantitated from 3
to 5 independent experiments to calculate the mean and SE, and values
were normalized to those obtained for control cells. Loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential was detected using the fluorescent dye chloromethylX-rosamine (CMXRos, Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) by incubating primary
APL cells in 200 nmol/L CMXRos for 15 min at 37jC and analyzing for
reduced fluorescence by flow cytometry.

Cell lysis and Western blot analysis. Cell lysis and Western blot
analysis were performed as previously described (29).
Analysis of signaling pathway activation by flow cytometry. APL cells
were incubated F ATRA overnight with the indicated inhibitors or vehicle
control. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Fix & Perm kit
(Caltag/Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primary
antibodies used were anti–pS473-Akt (clone 193H12; unconjugated; Cell
Signaling Technology) and anti–pS235/236-S6 (clone D57.2.2E; Alexa Fluor
488 Conjugated; Cell Signaling Technology). For pAkt staining, secondary
anti–rabbit-APC antibody was used (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). Samples
were analyzed on a Cyan Analyzer (DAKO Cytomation) and results depicted
as median fluorescent intensity of the whole population.
Morphologic assessment of leukemic cells. May-Grunwald Giemsa
staining was used to analyze myeloid differentiation. Cytospins were
prepared from cells cultured in suspension using the centrifugation
(Shandon Cytospin 4; Thermo Electron Corporation) and washed once in
PBS. Cytospins were fixed and stained in May-Grunwald solution (SigmaAldrich) for 5 min, rinsed in water for 5 s, followed by counter-staining of
nuclei with 10% Giemsa solution (Merck kGaA) for 15 min. Photographs
were taken at 250 magnification using a Zeiss microscope coupled to a
CCD camera (AxioCam; HPc; Zeiss).
Measurement of cell surface expression of CD11b. Neutrophil
differentiation was assessed by analysis for the cell surface marker
CD11b, which is associated with myeloid maturation. Cells were washed
in PBS, resuspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1%
sodium azide, and stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD11b polyclonal
antibodies for 30 min at 4jC. After 2 washes in PBS containing 1% bovine
serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide, cells were fixed using CellFix 10
buffer (BD Biosciences). The proportion of cells expressing CD11b and the

www.aacrjournals.org

fluorescence intensity of CD11b were measured by flow cytometry using a
FACS Scan (BD FACSCanto Flow cytometer, BD Biosciences or Cyan ADP
Analyzer, DAKO), using an isotype-matched control antibody (used for
subtraction of background signal). The results were analyzed using BD
FACSDIVA (BD Biosciences) or SUMMIT (DAKO) software and were
quantitated from three independent experiments to calculate mean and SE,
and values were normalized to those obtained for the control cells.
Determination of reactive oxygen species generation. Acquisition of
respiratory burst activity was assessed by the production of hydrogen
peroxide using 2¶7¶dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA; Molecular Probes)
as previously described (33). Briefly, APL cells were loaded with 10 Amol/L
DCFDA for 15 min at 37jC and 5% of CO2, followed by incubation in the
absence or presence of 1 Ag/mL TPA (Sigma) for 5 min at 37jC in 5% CO2.
The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, rinsed, and analyzed by flow
cytometry for green fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 515 nm)
using a FACS Scan (Cyan ADP Analyzer; DAKO). The results were analyzed
using SUMMIT (DAKO) software.

Results
Expression and activity of class IA PI3Ks in APL cells. We
first evaluated the expression levels of class IA PI3K isoforms in the
APL cell line NB-4 and in primary APL samples, by immunoblotting
of total cell lysates (Fig. 1A). The p85 regulatory subunit of
PI3K was found in all APL cells. Whereas NB-4 expressed all 3 class
IA PI3K catalytic subunits, primary APL often lacked detectable
expression of p110a, in contrast to p110h and p110y, which were
always detected. We and others have previously documented that

Class I PI3Ks in APL Survival and Differentiation

p110y was consistently present in primary non-APL subtypes
of AML cells, with more variable expression of p110a and p110h
(28, 29). Thus, whereas expression of p110a and p110y in APL were
analogous to primary non-APL subtypes of AML cells, APL seemed
to have higher expression of p110h. The Oncomine gene expression
profiling database4 also revealed relatively higher p110h mRNA
levels in morphologically or molecularly defined APL, compared
with non-APL cells (Fig. 1B; ref. 34).
Basal PI3K pathway activation in APL cells is blocked by
pan-class I inhibitors, but not by isoform-selective PI3K
inhibitors or rapamycin. To determine PI3K pathway activation,
we analyzed the phosphorylation of the PI3K target Akt by
immunoblotting using antibodies specific for phosphorylated
threonine 308 or serine 473 of this kinase ( further called pT308Akt and pS473-Akt). Basal Akt phosphorylation was detected in
NB-4 cells (Fig. 2A, top) and in six of eight primary APL samples
(Fig. 2B, top and middle; data not shown). This could be fully
inhibited by PI-103 (a pan-class I PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) or
LY294002, suggesting that Akt phosphorylation in these cells
results from the constitutive activation of class I PI3Ks. Modest
inhibition of basal Akt phosphorylation was induced by selective
inhibition of the p110h or p110y isoforms of PI3K (by TGX155 and
IC87114, respectively; ref. 13) or of mTORC-1 [by rapamycin (31),
both in NB-4 cells (Fig. 2A, top) and primary APL cells (Fig. 2B, top
and middle)]. In contrast to the findings in primary APL cells,
previously published data, including from our group, has suggested
that in non-APL AML (28, 29), the p110y isoform of PI3K is mainly
responsible for the basal activation of PI3K/Akt.
ATRA-induced PI3K pathway activation is sensitive to
isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors and rapamycin. ATRA has
been shown to activate Akt and p70 S6 kinase in NB-4 cells, and it
has been suggested, based on the use of LY294002, that the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway is essential for cellular differentiation in
response to ATRA (31). Expression of the class IB PI3K p110g was
slightly increased upon ATRA treatment in NB-4 cells, in keeping
with the results of Scholl and colleagues (30), and in three of four
primary APL samples (Fig. 2B, bottom). However, pharmacologic
inhibition of p110g (using the selective inhibitor AS604850) did not
affect Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, bottom), suggesting that the
ATRA-induced Akt activation is not a consequence of p110g upregulation.
Both in NB-4 cells (Fig. 2A and C) and in 6 of 8 primary APL
samples (Fig. 2B–D; data not shown), ATRA treatment led to
phosphorylation of Akt and S6, in a PI-103– or LY294002dependent manner. In primary APL cells, but not in NB-4, this
ATRA-induced phosphorylation of Akt and S6 was also inhibited by
isoform-selective inhibitors of p110h or p110y but not of p110a
(Fig. 2A–D). Rapamycin partially inhibited ATRA-induced pS473Akt in NB-4 cells (Fig. 2A and C), with an even more significant
effect in three separate primary APL samples (Fig. 2C and D).
Rapamycin also abrogated ATRA-induced S6 phosphorylation in
NB-4 (Fig. 2A and C) and primary APL cells (Fig. 2B–D).
Inhibition of class I PI3K + mTOR impairs NB-4 cell
proliferation in the absence or presence of ATRA but does
not lead to apoptosis. PI-103 and LY294002 strongly inhibited cell
NB-4 cell proliferation over a 72-hour period, with a reduction in
cell numbers (as assessed by CASY cell counting) of 60% and 72%,
respectively (Fig. 3A). MTS assays yielded similar observations,

with a decrease of signal to 41% and 33% of control for PI-103 and
LY294002, respectively (data not shown).
Whereas LY294002 induced a significant proapoptotic effect
(Fig. 3B), PI-103 only induced a minor increase in apoptotic cells
(Fig. 3B), despite reducing Akt phosphorylation to the same extent
as LY294002 (Fig. 2A). Selective inhibitors of p110h, p110y, p110g,
or mTOR all only induced a modest reduction in NB-4 cell
proliferation compared with PI-103 and failed to trigger cell death
(Fig. 3A and B).
Treatment of NB-4 cells with ATRA for a 72-hour period led to a
20% to 30% reduction of proliferation—a similar reduction was also
detected in the presence of PI3K inhibitors or rapamycin (Fig. 3A).
Inhibition of class I PI3K + mTOR induces apoptosis of
primary APL cells in the absence or presence of ATRA.
Incubation of primary patient-derived leukemia cells with a doserange of PI-103 for 5 days led to substantial inhibition in the
MTS signal, with a maximal inhibition at 0.5 Amol/L (Fig. 4A).
Interestingly, selective blockade of p110h, p110y, or mTOR had a
more significant effect on these primary cells than in NB-4 cells,
inducing a reduction in MTS activity approaching the level
observed with PI-103 (Fig. 4B). An inhibitor with selectivity for

RPMI/10% FCS for 5 d F ATRA, in the
presence of (A) increasing concentrations

the indicated PI3K and mTOR inhibitors
(n = 7), followed by MTS staining. Results

cells (D ) were incubated with the indicated
inhibitors for 3 d and examined by flow
cytometry for mitochondrial membrane

immunoblotting for the presence of
proCaspase-9, cleaved Caspase-9, and

cytometric Annexin V/PI assays showed that inhibitors of p110h,
p110y or mTOR, as well as PI-103, potently induced cell death of
primary APL cells (Fig. 4C), indicating that the reduction in the
MTS signal is largely due to induction of apoptosis. Incubation of
primary APL cells with PI3K inhibitors led to a loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential as detected by CMXRos
fluorescence, to a reduction in the level of full length procaspase9 and the appearance of the cleaved, active, caspase-9 fragment
(Fig. 4D). These results indicate that the effects of PI3K inhibitors
are likely to be mediated by the mitochondrial pathway of cell
death.
Treatment of primary APL cells with ATRA increased cell
recovery at the end of the 5 day incubation period, with an increase
in MTS activity (Fig. 4A and B) and a reduction in apoptotic cells
(Fig. 4C), in keeping with previously published data (35, 36). The
presence of ATRA did not significantly rescue the APL cells from
the apoptotic effect of the PI3K and mTOR inhibitors (Fig. 4C).
ATRA-induced chemoresistance and up-regulation of MCL-1
are reduced by inhibition of class I PI3K. ATRA has previously
been shown to attenuate anthracycline-induced cytotoxicity in APL
cells (37). In NB-4 cells, ATRA preincubation significantly reduced
apoptosis induced by the anthracycline doxorubicin but not by

arsenic trioxide, another therapeutic agent used in APL (Fig. 5A).
ATRA was unable to protect NB-4 cells from doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis in the presence of PI-103. Arsenic trioxide induced
apoptosis was enhanced in the presence of PI-103, with or without
ATRA (Fig. 5A).
In primary APL, ATRA consistently reduced the apoptotic
response to doxorubicin and, to a lesser extent, to arsenic trioxide.
The addition of PI-103 and, less markedly, rapamycin, overcame
this protective effect of ATRA, with some variation observed
among patient samples (Fig. 5B).
To investigate the potential mechanism by which ATRA inhibits
cell death, we measured the expression of Bcl-2 family members
following overnight incubation with this compound. ATRA induced
an increase in the level of the antiapoptotic MCL-1 protein, in a PI103–dependent manner (Fig. 5C). ATRA did not affect the levels of
BCL-XL (Fig. 5C), XIAP, or survivin (data not shown), and reduced
the levels of Bcl-2 [as previously reported (37), and of the
proapoptotic protein BIM in a PI-103–independent manner
(Fig. 5C)].
Inhibition of class I PI3K or mTOR does not affect
spontaneous or ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation.

or rapamycin did not affect the basal levels of CD11b and p47/p67phox (cytosolic components of the respiratory burst enzyme
NADPH oxidase) or TPA-induced production of reactive oxygen
species (data not shown).
Incubation of these cells with ATRA increased cell-surface
CD11b expression (data not shown) and resulted in morphologic
maturation (Fig. 6A) and up-regulation of TPA-induced respiratory
burst activity (Fig. 6B and C). Addition of PI-103 or isoformselective PI3K inhibitors or rapamycin did not significantly affect
any aspect of ATRA-induced differentiation (Fig. 6A–C); a 25%
reduction of ATRA-induced CD11b expression was seen with
LY294002 in NB-4 cells (data not shown). These results indicate
that although treatment of APL cells with ATRA increases PI3K/

Akt/mTOR activity, this pathway does not play a significant role in
cell differentiation.

Discussion
In malignant hematologic disease, PI3K signaling is most likely
activated by oncogenic mutations of upstream regulators such as
tyrosine kinases and Ras (38) and/or autocrine growth factor loops
(21). Of the different PI3K isoforms, it has been shown that p110y
plays an important role in cell proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance in AML (28, 29). In this study, we have used a panel of
novel, selective PI3K inhibitors to examine the role of class I PI3K
signaling in APL pathophysiology. Previous work using the NB-4

Figure 6. Effect of class IA PI3K and mTOR inhibition on APL cell differentiation. Primary APL cells were cultured for 5 d, in the presence of compounds as indicated,
followed by cytospin and May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining (A). NB-4 (B) or primary APL cells (C ) were cultured for 5 d in the presence of ATRA and inhibitors as
indicated, followed by DCF-DA loading and TPA stimulation and measurement of respiratory burst by FACS. Results are expressed as a % of control (no ATRA,

APL cell line has shown that ATRA activates PI3K/Akt and mTOR
signaling (30, 31) and studies using the broad-spectrum PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 (which also inhibits mTORC1) have suggested a
role for PI3K/Akt signaling in mediating ATRA-induced APL cell
differentiation (30, 31, 39). The putative involvement of PI3K
signaling in retinoid-induced differentiation of APL cells is of
importance in understanding the mechanisms underlying this
process and may also have implications for the use of PI3K
inhibitors in the treatment of APL, in that agents that interfere
with ATRA-induced differentiation could compromise the therapeutic benefit of ATRA.
In primary APL, we found that in addition to p110y, p110h was
expressed in all cases, whereas p110a expression was more
variable. Analysis of the Oncomine database, a compendium of
cancer transcriptome profiles from published case series, also
shows consistently higher levels of p110h mRNA in APL cases
compared with other FAB subtypes of AML or other cytogenetic
groups (34). As judged by phosphorylation of Akt, the PI3K/Akt
signaling axis is constitutively activated in APL and is further
enhanced upon treatment with ATRA. Both in NB-4 and primary
APL, this enhancement can be blocked by the pan-class I PI3K
inhibitor PI-103 (which also inhibits mTORC1). The mechanism of
ATRA-induced Akt phosphorylation is unclear. It has previously
been suggested that this may be due to up-regulation of the p110g
isoform (30), but this is unlikely to be the main mechanism, given
that we found that a selective p110g inhibitor did not affect Akt
phosphorylation induced by ATRA in NB-4 cells.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (3). February 1, 2009

The mTOR pathway has a complex interrelationship with PI3K/
Akt signaling. Indeed, Akt can activate mTOR (in the rapamycinsensitive mTORC1 complex) via its effects on TSC2/Rheb and this
can cause feedback inhibition of PI3K signaling, predominantly via
p70 S6-kinase–mediated phosphorylation of the IRS-1 adaptor that
is associated with insulin/IGF-I receptors (23). In addition, mTOR
(in the rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2 complex) has been
identified as a kinase that phosphorylates Akt at S473 thereby
resulting in its full activation (24, 25, 40). To add further complexity
to the regulation of Akt activation, prolonged treatment of some
cell types with rapamycin can result in inhibition of mTORC2
assembly and reduction in pS473-Akt (41). The data presented in
this article indicate that ATRA-treated APL cells can be included in
the category of cells where Akt S473 phosphorylation is rapamycinsensitive. Treatment of non-APL AML cells with rapamycin
analogues has been reported to either activate Akt signaling via
derepression of the IGF-I pathway (22) or to reduce mTORC2
signaling and inhibit Akt phosphorylation (42).
LY294002 has been widely used as a tool compound to evaluate
the role of PI3K signaling in a variety of cellular functions.
LY294002 inhibits all classes of PI3Ks and is also known now to
have off-target effects on related kinases such as mTOR and
DNA-PK and unrelated kinases including PIM and CK2 (14).
Using LY294002, a number of investigators have implicated PI3K/
Akt signaling in ATRA-induced differentiation of NB-4 APL cells
(30, 31, 43). Using the more selective class I PI3K inhibitor PI-103
(which also inhibits mTORC1), we show here that ATRA-induced

Class I PI3Ks in APL Survival and Differentiation

phosphorylation of Akt and S6 can be blocked by this compound in
NB-4 cells and primary APL, without any effect on cell
differentiation. We also showed that direct inhibition of mTORC1
using rapamycin did not affect cell differentiation. Taken together,
these results indicate that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
does not play a major role in differentiation signaling downstream
of ATRA in APL cells.
The PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to control apoptosis by
various mechanisms, including via the regulation of Bcl-2 family
members such as Bad, Bim, and Mcl-1 (44). We found that,
although blockade of PI3K/Akt signaling in NB-4 cells inhibits
proliferation, it did not trigger apoptosis. In contrast, class I PI3K
inhibition promotes cell death of primary APL cells in a dosedependent manner. The most potent proapoptotic effect was seen
with combined blockade of all class I PI3Ks + mTOR with the
compound PI-103. Inhibition of individual PI3K isoforms showed
that p110a is not involved in survival signaling in primary APL
cells, likely due to low/absent expression levels, but that p110h and
p110y play a significant part in preventing spontaneous apoptosis.
In primary APL cells, a proapoptotic effect is also seen upon
rapamycin treatment, possibly due to its combined effects on
inhibition of mTORC1 signaling and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, presumably by destabilizing mTORC2.
Consistent with findings from other investigators, we find that
incubation of primary APL cells with ATRA improves viability and
prolongs survival ex vivo (4, 35, 36). The clinical use of ATRA in
APL, in particular as a single agent, can result in increased
numbers of WBC in the initial treatment period before the onset of
apoptosis associated with terminal differentiation (45). This is
linked to clinical complications and the presence of a high
leukocyte count predisposes to the development of the ATRAsyndrome and to premature death (46). In this study, we show that
blockade of PI3K signaling reduces cell number and viability in
response to ATRA in primary APL cells, which may have significant
implications for the clinical use of agents targeting this pathway.
In addition to its effects on basal cell survival, treatment with
ATRA has been shown to impair the cell death response of APL

cells in vitro to clinically relevant therapeutic agents including
anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin) and to arsenic trioxide (37).
The prosurvival signaling effects of ATRA may be partially
explained by ATRA-induced activation of NF-nB signaling
(47, 48). We show that blockade of class I PI3K signaling negates
the prosurvival effects of ATRA and promotes APL cell death when
combined with doxorubicin or arsenic trioxide. ATRA addition to
APL cells leads to an increase in the levels of the antiapoptotic
protein Mcl-1 in a PI3K-dependent manner and the reversal of this
increase with PI-103 may contribute to the proapoptotic effect of
this compound.
In summary, we have shown that the class I PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway plays a major part in controlling basal and ATRAregulated cell proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance pathways in primary APL cells. Despite its potent activation by ATRA,
this signaling module is not involved in APL cell differentiation
processes. Our results suggest that addition of class I PI3K
inhibitors to differentiation induction treatment regimens may be
clinically useful in APL.
