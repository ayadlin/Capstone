ABSTRACT
Network-based strategies provided by systems biology are attractive tools for
cancer therapy. Modulation of cancer networks by anticancer drugs may alter the
response of malignant cells and/or drive network re-organization into the inhibition of
cancer progression. Previously, using systems biology approach and cancer signaling
networks, we identified top-5 highly expressed and connected proteins (HSP90AB1,
CSNK2B, TK1, YWHAB and VIM) in the invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line.
Here, we have knocked down the expression of these proteins, individually or together
using siRNAs. The transfected cell lines were assessed for in vitro cell growth, colony
formation, migration and invasion relative to control transfected MDA-MB-231,
the non-invasive MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line and the non-tumoral mammary
epithelial cell line MCF-10A. The knockdown of the top-5 upregulated connectivity
hubs successfully inhibited the in vitro proliferation, colony formation, anchorage
independence, migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells; with minimal effects in
the control transfected MDA-MB-231 cells or MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells. The in vitro
validation of bioinformatics predictions regarding optimized multi-target selection
for therapy suggests that protein expression levels together with protein-protein
interaction network analysis may provide an optimized combinatorial target selection
for a highly effective anti-metastatic precision therapy in triple-negative breast cancer.
This approach increases the ability to identify not only druggable hubs as essential
targets for cancer survival, but also interactions most susceptible to synergistic drug
action. The data provided in this report constitute a preliminary step toward the
personalized clinical application of our strategy to optimize the therapeutic use of
anti-cancer drugs.

mortality rate has not changed significantly since 1992.
Sadly, because of drug resistance, the vast majority of
BC patients experience tumor progression and relapse
following the first round of chemotherapy. However,
due to recent advances in medical research, tumors can
now be classified according to molecular targets, which
allows personalized treatment with drugs that specifically
inhibit these targets to improve clinical outcomes [2, 3].

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer (BC) accounted for approximately
1.67 million new cancer cases in 2012 (25% of all cancers)
worldwide with an estimated number of 522,000 deaths
[1]. Although significant improvements in diagnosis
and treatment have been made in the past few years, BC
remains the third leading cause of death globally and its

Precision medicine requires the assessment of a substantial
number of molecular combinations resulting from intratumoral heterogeneity and human haplotype variability
that underlie the malignant progression [4–7]. The
shortcomings of one-size-fits-all treatments are well
reflected in the often disappointing outcomes of current
chemotherapies, where drugs directed at an individual
target frequently show limited efficacy and safety due to
factors such as off-target interactions, bypass mechanisms
and cross-talk across compensatory escape pathways [8].
One of the major hallmarks of cancer is
dysregulation of gene expression in malignant cells
[9]. Recent progress in high-throughput generation of
transcriptome, proteome, and interactome data together
with the in silico data mining offers a new and promising
opportunity to identify key protein targets that are of
marginal implications in normal cells, but represent
molecular signaling hubs in cancer cells [10–15]. Ample
body of evidence has shown that an efficacious cancer
treatment requires multi-drug therapeutics [16]. The
question is which of the hundreds of available compounds
should be selected for personalized treatment and what
would be the optimized combination therapy composed
of in order to maximize efficacy and minimize potential
side effects.
The use of systems biology approaches to address
cancer research has been recently proposed both as a
conceptual organizing principle and a practical tool for
therapy selection [17]. It has been recently demonstrated
that the probability of 5-year patient survival [18] is
inversely proportional to the complexity of the signaling
network [17, 19] for the types of cancer considered in this
study.
In order to design a strategy of protein target
identification that would allow the development of
therapeutic strategies with the lowest level of deleterious
side effects possible, we compared the gene expression
pattern of different malignant cell lines representative
of the main forms of breast cancer by subtracting their
gene expression level (RNA-seq) from those of a nontumoral cell line used as a reference. The genes found to
be upregulated in malignant cell lines by comparison to
the reference were considered potential targets for drug
development because the transient inhibition of their
expression should not affect the living condition of the
reference cells. Among the 150-300 upregulated genes in
malignant cells, some have a larger likelihood of being
suitable targets for drug development than the others
because they warrant a larger protein connectivity rate in
the cell-line-specific sub-networks induced by signaling
rewiring during the oncogenesis process [20]. To rank
the likelihood of potential protein target according to
the benefit of their inhibition to patients by a precision
therapy, we used degree-entropy as a measure of protein
connectivity. Proteins acting as connectivity hubs in the
signaling network of malignant cell lines were found by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

comparing transcriptome (RNA-seq) to interactome data.
Normalized RNA-seq data allow the inference of the
signaling proteins that are effectively expressed in a given
malignant cell line by comparison to non-tumoral cell line
used as a reference. The local degree-entropy associated
to each expressed proteins can be calculated from the
interactome data and used to rank the relative connectivity
rate according to the total degree-entropy associated to the
whole network as well as to rank the comparative benefits
of drug cocktails to patients according to the profile of
their upregulated top connectivity hubs [21, 22]. These
analyses identified a network of 5 genes: HSP90AB1 (a
member of the heat shock family of proteins), CSNK2B,
(casein kinase 2β), TK1 (thymidine kinase 1), YWHAB
(a member of the 14-3-3 family of proteins), and VIM
(vimentin, a type III mesenchymal intermediate filament)
that have also been reported to be upregulated in breast
cancer [23–31]. In the present study, we validate the five
upregulated most connected hubs (top-5) in the protein
interactome of MDA-MB-231 as specific targets for
potential therapeutic application in precision medicine
of cancer by their knockdown using interfering RNA
(siRNA) [17, 20–22]. We show that the inactivation
of these 5 targets in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly
decreases cell proliferation, colony formation, anchorageindependent cell growth, cell migration and cell invasion.
This proof-of-concept study can serve as a preliminary
step in the process of drug discovery towards development
of precision therapies.

RESULTS
Protein levels and key target knockdown
We validated the results of our in silico analysis by
processing lysates from MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A
cells for immunoblotting with HSP90AB1, CSNK2B,
TK1, YWHAB, VIM and β-actin (control) antibodies.
The results showed increased protein levels for all targets
except YWHAB in MDA-MB-231 relative to MCF10A cells (Figure 1A). To assess the role of the network
targets in the in vitro tumorigenic and metastatic behavior
of MDA-MB-231 cells, all 5 targets were knocked down
in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells. All cell
lines were transfected with two different concentrations
(50 and 100 nM) of siRNA combination (HSP90AB1,
CSNK2B, TK1, YWHAB, VIM). The downregulation of
the corresponding proteins was assessed after 24 and 48
h using immunoblotting of cell lysates with the respective
antibodies. All proteins were effectively downregulated
(>90%) in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. In MCF-10A
cells, HSP90AB1, CSNK2B, TK1, VIM were also reduced
by >90% whereas YWHAB was decreased by ~60%
(Figure 1B). We then proceeded with functional assays
using individual (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2) as
well as combined (Figures 2–7) network targets knockdown

transfectants. Knockdown of individual member of the
network targets had no observable effect on anchorageindependent/cell growth, survival, foci formation, or cell
migration and invasion. In contrast, the knockdown of the
combined network targets had profound effects on in vitro
growth, migratory and invasive properties of MDA-MB-231
cells suggesting a synergistic rather than an additive effect of
multiple siRNA transfections on malignant signal network.

transfected cultures showed similar growth patterns
whereas cells transfected with target siRNAs grew slower
although not significantly (Figure 2B). In contrast, the
growth of target siRNA transfected MDA-MB-231 cells
was significantly lower (p <0.0001) than the untransfected
or scrambled siRNA transfected cultures (Figure 2C).
To further analyze this difference in growth capacity,
we performed a growth kinetics assay accompanied by
crystal violet incorporation, which correlates with total
cell numbers. Consistent with the previous assay, we noted
a significant reduction in the growth of MDA-MB-231
cultures treated with target siRNAs (Figure 2F) whereas
there were no differences in growth kinetics of MCF-10A
and MCF-7 cells (Figure 2D, E).
The survival of various cell lines after transfection
with scrambled and target siRNAs was also evaluated by an
MTT assay (see Materials and Methods). This assay detected
no difference between untransfected cells and scrambled
or target siRNAs transfected MCF-10A cells (Figure 2G).
MCF-7 cells transfected with the target siRNA also showed
a decrease in survival relative to the untransfected and
scrambled siRNA transfected cells although not significantly
different (Figure 2H). The survival of MDA-MB-231 cells
transfected with the target siRNAs was significantly lower

The expression of the network targets is essential
to MDA-MB-231 cell growth and survival
Increased cell growth is one of the main cellular
events associated with tumor development and
progression. Thus, we asked whether the knockdown
of top-5 network targets modifies the growth behavior
of the breast cell lines under the study. To address this
question, single cell replicates of MCF-10A, MCF-7, and
MDA-MB-231 cells remained untransfected or transfected
with scrambled siRNA or target siRNAs. The trypsinized
cells counted at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h showed no significant
growth differences among untransfected, scrambled or
target siRNAs transfected MCF-10A cells (Figure 2A).
In MCF-7 cells, untransfected and scrambled siRNA

transfected cells (Figure 2I).
We further assessed changes in foci formation
upon network targets knockdown. Focus-forming assays
were performed as described in Materials and Methods.
At the end of 2-weeks in culture, a few small foci were
detected in untransfected as well as scrambled siRNA
and target siRNA transfected MCF-10A (Figure 3A, B,
Top). In contrast, we detected a ~40% reduction in the
number of foci in MCF-7 cells transfected with the target
siRNAs relative to the control and scrambled siRNA
transfected cells (Figure 3A, B, Middle). Knocking down

Knockdown of the key network targets induces
cell death in MDA-MB-231
To assess the effect of network targets knockdown
on cell death, we measured changes in the sub-G1 DNA
content as described in Materials and Methods. In MCF10A cells, ~5% of the cells transfected with target siRNA
exhibited sub-G1 DNA content (Figure 4A, C). A similar

viable cells assessed following trypan blue staining (A-C) or crystal violet staining (D-F) or MTT assay (G-I) as described in Materials and

rate of cell death was found in MDA-MB-231 cells
transfected with scrambled or target siRNAs for 48 h
(Figure 4B, D). However, the number of cells in sub-G1
in this cell line increased with longer Post-transfection
times. By 120 h post-transfection, ~40% of MDA-MB-231
cells had sub-G1 DNA content, indicating inhibition of
cell cycle progression and massive induction of cell death
(Figure 4B, D).

significant reduction in both migration and invasion of
MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with target siRNAs. When
compared to untransfected or scrambled siRNA transfected
cells, MDA-MB-231 network targets knockdowns showed
a 70% and 90% decrease in migration and invasion,
respectively (Figure 5, Migration; Invasion, A, B, MDAMB-231).
The results of the migration and invasion assays
confirmed the biological significance of the in silico
selected network targets [20] in MDA-MB-231 and led
us to further examine the effect of their knockdown on the
anchorage-independent growth of these cells as a measure
of their metastatic potential [32]. We found that the
knockdown of the top-5 network targets had very little or
no effect on the anchorage-independent growth of MCF10A or MCF-7 cells. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 cells
transfected with network targets siRNAs were completely
unable to grow (Figure 6A, 6B).

Knockdown of the key network targets inhibits
MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion
In vitro migration and invasion assays were
performed and quantitated as described in Materials
and Methods. There were no changes in the migratory
and invasive properties of MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells
transfected with network targets siRNAs (Figure 5,
Migration, Invasion; A, B). In contrast, there was a

activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways is
well documented to promote both tumor development
and progression [33]. To this end, we examined if the
knockdown of key network targets genes would modulate
PI3K-Akt and MAPK activity. Forty-eight hours after the
transfection of MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231 cells with
the scrambled or network targets siRNAs, cell extracts
from all transfectants were processed for immunoblotting
with phospho-specific antibodies to detect various
activated signaling molecules as depicted in Figure 7.
The analysis of the immunoblots from MCF-10A lysates
showed no detectable differences between lysates prepared
from scrambled or target siRNA transfected cells (Figure
7, MCF-10A). In contrast, a ~1.5-fold decrease in
phosphorylation levels of Akt (Ser473), GSK3β, PDK1

from RNA-seq analysis [20], in MDA-MB-231 cells

bioinformatics inferences in a protein-protein interaction

demonstrated that the overexpression of the 5 most
connected network targets significantly contribute to the
proliferative and invasive phenotype of MDA-MB-231.
Consistent with the bioinformatics inferences [20], the
knockdown of the network targets had little or no effects
on growth, migration and invasion of the non-invasive
MCF-7 or reference MCF-10A cells.
The components of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK
pathways, including GSK3β, PDK1, and c-RAF
have been reported to be involved in breast cancer
progression. GSK3β is a versatile enzyme involved in
numerous signaling pathways that influence metabolism,
embryogenesis, differentiation, migration, cell cycle
progression, and survival; including those activated
by growth factors, Wnts, cytokines, hedgehog and G
protein-coupled ligands [34, 35]. Recent data indicate
that alteration of PDK1 (Phosphoinositide-dependent
kinase 1) contributes to the oncogenic PI3K signaling in
breast cancer progression [36]. Dupuy et al. [37] showed

that PDK1 is required for efficient formation of liver
metastases. RAF is a component of the MAPK/ERK
signaling pathway that contributes to tumor initiation,
progression and metastasis [38]. MAPK/PI3K cross-talk
regulates Rac/Cdc42/PAK signaling and cytoskeletal
reorganization [39–41]. In the present study, we have
observed that downregulation of signaling network targets
significantly decreased the phosphorylation of Akt (473),
GSK3β, PDK1, and c-RAF in MDA-MB-231. These
observations explain the reduction of cell proliferation,
survival, migration and invasion that we observed upon
network targets knockdown. Although the participation of
key canonical pathways, such as those involving PI3KAkt, MAPK, IGF, FGF, MET and mTOR [2], is well
established in different cancers, these pathways cannot
capture the complex and context-dependent cellular
rewiring patterns behind distinct cancer phenotypes.
For instance, many genes identified through expression
profiling or genomic sequencing are either not druggable,

or are druggable but there are no approved drugs to target
them [20]. With an increasing interest in drug combination
screening, the approach discussed here can be readily used
as an efficient optimization procedure to identify potential
drug targets and their best combinations based on their
selectivity profiles and individual responses in given
cancer samples.
Several studies have reported the individual
expression pattern and function of each hub (TK1,
CSNK2B, VIM, YWHAB and HSP90AB1) in different
tumors and tumor models in vitro [23–31, 42–50].

Here, single siRNA transfections had no detectable
effect on the proliferative and invasive properties of
cell lines under study. These resutts are not necessarily
in contradiction with other studies where inactivation
of these hubs had measurable effects, and may be due
to different cell lines and culture/assay conditions. That
the effect of combination knockdown is larger than that
expected from their sum is most likely a consequence of
cell signaling pathway redundancy in malignant cells.
Consequently, simultaneous inactivation of several hubs
may be necessary for successful elimination of potential

alternative/crosstalking signaling pathways that are
necessary for the maintainance of the maligant phenotype.
Our results are supported by the well-known contribution
of the individual component of the network targets to
cancer development and progression. TK1 promotes cell
proliferation, decreases DNA repair efficiency and induces
cell death [23, 24, 51]. HSP90AB1 promotes angiogenesis
not only as a protein chaperone, but also as an mRNA
stabilizer for pro-angiogenic genes, such as BAZF [43].
Vimentin is a marker of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and promotes invasion and metastasis [25, 52].
YWHAB, a member of the 14-3-3 family of proteins is
involved in the activation of tumor/metastasis pathways
and inhibition of apoptosis [26, 44, 45, 47]. Similarly,
CK-2β promotes EMT and metastasis while inhibiting
apoptosis [30, 46, 48, 50]. It is suggested that the
concurrent inactivation of multiple hubs is more efficient
in the induction of cell death due to the communication
failures between functional modules and the lack of
alternative pathway options [53]. In agreement with this
phenomenon, we observed continued cell death beyond
48 h post siRNA transfection. This observation suggests
that despite the short half-life of the top-5 gene mRNA,
the transient knockdown was sufficient to significantly
affect the stability of a malignant signaling network [54,
55]. Using a modeling approach, Fumiã and Martins [56]
showed that while monotherapies were ineffective, drug
cocktails were highly effective and necessary for efficient
reversal of all hallmarks of cancer. These observations, in
association with the results of our previous studies [20,
21], indicate that top-5 genes identified here are potentially
valuable druggable targets in invasive breast cancer.
Significantly, the entire set of predicted drug targets
identified here has been experimentally validated by
available drugs or siRNAs [31, 57–61]. Thus, conceivably,
the described approach can be implemented for a
substantial number of currently used chemotherapeutic
drugs with well-described mechanisms of action as
reported in various studies [56]. It is hoped that our
strategy will aid in the elucidation of underlying molecular
networks of different tumors and histological subtypes.
As demonstrated here, this strategy is valuable and can,
potentially, add new tools to the armamentarium of drugs
at the disposal of oncologists.
The strong differences in the response of MDAMB-231 and MCF-7 cells to the inhibition of the top5 targets reinforce the concept of precision medicine,
which is considered as a shift away from the one-sizefits-all approach. Additionally, we confirmed the notion
of categorizing the efficacy likelihood of selected hub
targets as high and low according to their connectivity
rate (local network entropy) [21], which suggests that
precision medicine in terms of targeted therapeutics is
a sound new avenue for clinical practice. Indeed, the
significant decrease of cell proliferation, migration and
invasion, and increased cell death in MDA-MB-231,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

show that molecular dissection of tumors and multitarget agents should be classified as high efficacy group
treatment [3], and become a reality in the near future of
personalized therapy. Thus, the integration of interactome
and transcriptome data allows the effective selection
and prioritization of suitable protein targets for drug
development and experimental testing or eventual clinical
translation among the massive number of possible target
combinations.
Compared to conventional cytotoxic drugs that
affect both normal and tumoral cells, synthetic lethality
[62] can address anticancer therapy by optimal hub
targeting according to cancer type while sparing normal
cells. However, despite the advances in siRNA targeting
and compound screening, synthetic lethal interactions
between genes and/or drugs have remained extremely
difficult to predict on a global scale. Network-based
methods provide a convenient platform to find functional
interactions enabling the identification of targets and
drug combinations for effective and personalized cancer
therapies. We were able to induce a maximum of 40%
cell death by transiently inactivating top 5 hub proteins
in a TNBC cell line, which suggests that increasing the
number of deactivated hubs or combining siRNA therapy
with drugs may provide synergistic antitumor effects
with the current protocol of radiotherapy and adjuvant
chemotherapy. According to this rationale, cells sensitized
by top-5 target specific drugs (or more) should allow
for the reduction of cytotoxic drug concentrations of
individual drugs and hence lead to reduced adverse side
effects.

CONCLUSIONS
Based on the analysis of gene expression and
signaling protein-protein interaction networks using
bioinformatics tools, we tested a combinatorial
therapeutic approach, and validated it using cell-based
assays. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness
of this approach to significantly decrease malignant
cell proliferation, migration and invasion without any
noticeable deleterious side effects to the reference cell
line. While these results should be validated in vivo
using animal models, they clearly support the power of
bioinformatics inferences for identification and selection
of druggable hubs as well as formulating synergistic
combination drug therapies for treatment of breast cancer.

plate at 5 x 103 cells/well. At 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, 20 μl
of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) was added to each well, and the plates
were incubated at 37°C for another 4 h at which time
the resulting formazan crystals were solubilized by the
addition of 200 μl of MTT solubilization solution. The
absorbance at 570 nm was recorded using a microplate
reader (Bio Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). Each
experiment for each cell lines was repeated 3-5 times.

Antibodies
Antibodies, their source and respective dilutions
used in this study are listed in Table 1.

siRNA transfection
Table 2 is a list of target specific (HSP90AB1,
CSNK2B, TK1, YWHAB and VIM) and non-specific
(scrambled) siRNAs purchased from Sigma-Aldridch
(MISSION® pre-designed siRNAs). Transfections were
performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,
cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 5 x 105 cells/well and
incubated for 24 h. Replicate cultures remained untreated (i,
control) or incubated with scramble (ii) or individual (iii),
or a combination of network targets (iv) siRNAs at 50-100
nM concentration for 6 h. Transfectants were then rinsed
with PBS, subcultured and processed for various assays 48
h post siRNA transfection.

Cell cycle analysis
Six-well plates were inoculated with 1 x 106 cells/
well. At 48, 72, 96, 104, 112, and 120 h after plating,
cells were trypsinized and washed with PBS and stained
with propidium iodide (50 µg/mL in 3.8 mM sodium
citrate). Cell cycle analysis was performed using a
FACScalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest software (BD
Biosciences).

Preparation of cell extracts and immunoblotting
Confluent 6-well culture dishes were washed with
cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), solubilized in hot
SDS sample buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% (w/v)
SDS, 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mM EDTA, 0.5
mM PMSF) and boiled for 10 min. Protein determination
was done using Bradford (Pierce) assays according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fifty micrograms
of total cellular protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE,
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and processed
for immunoblotting. Membranes were blocked for 1 h
using 5% (W/V) gelatin in Tris buffered saline-Tween 20
(G/TBS-T). Then, membranes were incubated overnight
with primary antibodies (Table 1) in G/TBS-T. After
three washes of 10 min in TBS-T buffer, membranes
were incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody
(Table 1) and developed by LI-COR IR fluorescent dyes.
Immunoblots were performed at least three independent
times and a representative experiment is shown in Figures
1 and 7. To evaluate the efficiency of gene knockdown
at 24 and 48 h post siRNA transfection, transfected
cells were collected to measure the protein level of each
targeted gene. Image J was used to quantify the results.

Focus formation assay
Transfected and non-transfected cells were plated
in six-well plates at 5x102 cells/well. Growth media were
replaced every 2 days. After 2 weeks, cells were rinsed
with PBS, fixed with glutaraldehyde for 10 min, and
stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Foci were visualized
using an inverted microscope and photographed.

In vitro cell migration and invasion assays
Cell migration was measured by inoculating
5x104 cells in the upper chamber of Cultrex Transwell
inserts (polycarbonate membrane, 8 µm pore size) in
a 96-well plate (Trevigen, MD, USA). Culture media
supplemented with 0.5% or 10% FBS was added to
the top and bottom chamber, respectively. Cells were
incubated at 37ºC and allowed to migrate for 24 h.
Migrated cells were detected and quantified using
Calcein-AM according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The fluorescence of migrated cells was recorded using
a 490 nm excitation filter and a 520 nm emission filter
using a microplate reader. Matrigel invasion assays
were performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Cultrex Transwell, Trevigen). For each cell

Cell proliferation and survival assays
For cell growth, replicate cultures were established
48 h after transfection in 24-well plates (Sarstedt, Canada)
