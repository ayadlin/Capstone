BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to confirm whether racial disparity exists with regard to
outcome between black women and white women with ovarian cancer and to identify factors associated
with the administration of adjuvant treatment that had an impact on survival. METHODS: A retrospective
review of 97 black women and 1392 white women with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III/IV ovarian carcinoma was performed. All patients received paclitaxel combined with cisplatin
while participating in 1 of 7 Gynecologic Oncology Group clinical trials. The treatment parameters that were
reviewed included relative dose, relative time, and relative dose intensity. The treatment parameters and
outcomes were compared between black patients and white patients. RESULTS: There were no differences
in relative dose (0.90 vs 0.89), relative time (1.02 vs 0.99), or relative dose intensity (0.90 vs 0.91) received
between black patients and white patients. Black women had less grade 3 and 4 leukopenia (53% vs 63%;
P < .05) and gastrointestinal toxicity (10% vs 19%; P < .05) than white women. Performance status >0, age
70 years, and mucinous histology were associated with not completing treatment (P < .001). The median
progression-free survival was 16.2 months for black patients and 16.1 months for white patients, and the

median overall survival was 37.9 months and 39.7 months, respectively (P > .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS:
When they received similar treatment, there was no difference in clinical outcome between black women
and white women with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer when they received similar treatment as
participants in Gynecologic Oncology Group clinical trials. Black patients may experience less severe gastrointestinal toxicity or leukopenia compared with whites when treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.

KEY WORDS: ovarian cancer, chemotherapy, Gynecologic Oncology Group, racial disparity.

Greater than 20,000 new cases of ovarian cancer are
diagnosed annually in the United States.1 Black women
have a lower incidence of ovarian cancer than white
women, and the age-adjusted rates range from 13.1 per
100,000 for whites to 9.0 per 100,000 for blacks.2
Although improvements in contemporary management
of ovarian cancer (to include optimal surgical cytoreduction and more effective adjuvant chemotherapy) have
accompanied a decline in cancer-related mortality over
the past 30 years, survival does not appear to have
improved for all racial groups.1,3,4 Despite the overwhelming, significant improvements in 2-year and 5-year
survival noted among white women over the past 3 decades, there has not been a similar improvement in survival
among black women over this 30-year period. The 5-year
survival rate for whites diagnosed with ovarian cancer has
increased from 36% to 45% whereas survival for blacks
has decreased from 43% to 39%.1
Possible reasons for worse survival observed among
black women with ovarian cancer compared with white
women include lower rates of surgical staging and adjuvant chemotherapy administration; increased medical
comorbidities; impaired access to care; and more aggressive tumors observed among black women with ovarian
cancer.5-7 Of all of the above-described factors, primary
cytoreductive surgery and exposure to platinum-based
chemotherapy are the most important clinical factors
impacting survival in women with advanced epithelial
ovarian cancer.8 To date, studies that evaluate the impact
of race on ovarian cancer survival have not taken into
account the specific agents that comprise the chemotherapy regimen, nor have they detailed the application or
aggressiveness of surgical debulking5-7,9,10 Chemotherapy
treatment usually is treated as a dichotomized (yes vs no)
variable, and most epidemiologic studies have not
included adjuvant chemotherapy as an analytical variable.5-7,9-12 When it is mentioned, surgical debulking

status also usually is described as a dichotomized variable
(aggressive vs nonaggressive); and, when it is not mentioned, epidemiologic studies of ovarian cancer use International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
(FIGO) stage as a surrogate for surgical debulking status.5-7,9,10,12 Neither approach comments on the patient’s
tumor burden after surgery, that is, whether it is optimal
(1 cm in size for any remaining lesion) versus suboptimal (>1 cm in size for any remaining lesion), which is the
variable with the most powerful impact on survival.8,13
Currently, to our knowledge, no studies of the impact of
race or ethnicity on ovarian cancer survival have included
dose intensity of chemotherapy in a uniformly surgically
staged population. Any racial difference in chemotherapy
response or survival among patients with ovarian cancer
would suggest that a biologic etiology may be associated
in part with the poor outcome observed among black
women with advanced stage ovarian cancer. The objective
of the current study was to determine whether blacks with
advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who were treated as
part of a prospective clinical trial experienced disparities
in the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy compared with whites and whether there were any differences
in survival between blacks and whites that could be influenced by differences in chemotherapy dosing parameters.

were not eligible. The current analysis included only
patients who received a standard intravenous cisplatin/
paclitaxel regimen (paclitaxel, 135 mg/m2; cisplatin,
75 mg/m2 intravenously for 6 cycles) (Table 1). Further
details regarding eligibility, treatment, and outcomes were
published previously.14-19 Data on patient demographics,
tumor characteristics, and course of treatment were collected from a retrospective chart review. Racial designation as black or white reflected a nonuniform collection of
both self-described and investigator-reported methods.
Patients from other racial groups were excluded from this
analysis. All protocols received local institutional review
board approval, and all patients provided written
informed consent to participate in the protocols.
Several parameters of chemotherapy treatment were
evaluated. Relative dose (RD) was defined as the ratio of
actual to expected dose of chemotherapy in standard
chemotherapy regimens. This was calculated for both
paclitaxel and cisplatin, separately for each cycle. The relative time (RT) was defined as the ratio of actual to
expected duration of chemotherapy. RT was calculated
for 6 cycles, and the expected duration of time on chemotherapy was 126 days (21 days [ie, chemotherapy every 3
weeks]  6 [ie, total cycles]). The relative dose intensity
(RDI) was defined as the ratio of RD to RT. Dose adjustments for advanced age, previous radiation therapy, or
body surface area (BSA) >2 mg/m2 were not considered
when calculating the expected dose of chemotherapy for
each treatment cycle; and these adjustments were considered dose reductions, because they differed from the
standard dose of chemotherapy. The completion of 6
cycles of chemotherapy was defined as treatment completion, because this was the proposed number of cycles in
4212

the 7 GOG studies that were included in our analysis and
was the accepted therapy for epithelial ovarian cancer at
the time of study accrual. The average RD, RT, or RDI
calculated based on cisplatin and paclitaxel was used as a
summarized parameter of the combined doublet regimen,
and a ratio <1.0 indicated that the patient received less
intense chemotherapy than was planned.
The baseline PS before the start of chemotherapy
was graded according to GOG criteria as follows: 0, fully
ambulatory with no restrictions; 1, restricted in physically
strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to perform
light work; and 2, ambulatory and capable of self-care but
unable to perform any work activities. The time at risk for
disease progression or death was measured from the date
of treatment randomization. Overall survival (OS) was
measured to the date of death from any cause, and progression-free survival (PFS) was measured to the date of
disease recurrence or death. Adverse effects were graded
according to GOG Common Toxicity Criteria.
Statistical Analysis
The mean RD, RT, and RDI between blacks and whites
were compared using the Student t test. The number of
treatment cycles, cause of treatment incompletion, and
causes of toxicity were compared by using Pearson chisquare tests or Fisher exact tests. The factors associated
with treatment incompletion were identified using a logistic regression model. Associations of RD, RT, or RDI
with survival were estimated using a Cox regression model
that was adjusted for established prognostic factors (age,
PS, stage/debulking status, tumor grade, histology, and
race). The interaction between race and treatment

parameters also was assessed. The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to estimate the cumulative probability of PFS or
OS. Because patients who had disease progression, poor
quality of life, or other unknown adverse factors were
more likely to stop treatment to avoid the ‘‘outcome to
cause’’ bias, the survival analysis on RD, RT, and RDI was
restricted to patients who completed all 6 cycles of chemotherapy, whereas all other analyses were done based on all
patients. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis System software (SAS version 9.1; SAS
Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
In total, 1392 white women and 97 black women with
FIGO stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer were
assigned to receive paclitaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy
(Table 2). Generally, there were no significant differences
in patient characteristics between white patients and black
patients, although no clear cell tumors were observed
among the black women in this study population (Table
2). Most patients (87%) completed all 6 cycles of chemotherapy required by the protocol, and there was no difference in treatment parameters between white patients and
black patients (Table 3). The average RD was 0.89, the
average RT was 0.99, and the average RDI was 0.91.
Ninety-five percent of patients reported at least 1 grade 3
or 4 adverse effect, and there was no difference in this rate
between white patients and black patients (95% vs 92%)
(Table 4). However, there was evidence of less leukopenia
(53% vs 63%) and less gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (10%
vs 19%) among black patients compared with white
patients, respectively (P < .04). The results were consistent when the analysis was adjusted for age, PS, and RD.
Three factors were identified as independently predictive
of treatment incompletion (Table 5): Patients aged 70
years with abnormal PS or with a mucinous cell type were
more likely to be unable to complete the required treatment cycles. Race was not associated with treatment
incompletion.
The survival of patients with advanced ovarian cancer in these trials was not affected by race. There was no
difference in PFS by race (P ¼ .223), and the median PFS
was 16.2 months for blacks versus 16.1 months for whites
(Fig. 1, top). Adjusted for age, PS, stage, debulking status,
and histology, the hazard ratio (HR) (black vs white) for

of PFS (Fig. 2, top) or OS (Fig. 2, bottom) when the analysis was stratified for debulking status. For those patients
who died, 91% died of recurrent cancer, and no difference
in cancer-related death rates were reported between white
women and black women (91% vs 94%). Neither RD,
nor RT, nor RDI was associated with PFS or OS (data not

DISCUSSION
Previous population-based studies of women with
advanced epithelial ovarian cancer have suggested that differences in surgery can lead to differences in outcome.
The extent of cytoreductive surgery has been recognized
for more than 20 years as an important factor in ovarian
cancer survival.8 Prognosis usually depends on the size of
residual disease, and median survival is related inversely to
4214

the size of residual tumor. The observed median survival
was 36 months for patients who had <2 cm residual tumor and 16 months for patients who had >2 cm residual
tumor.8,20 Specifically for patients who had FIGO stage
III disease, the median survival was 71.9 months for those
with microscopic residual tumor, 42.4 months for those
with <1 cm residual tumor, and 35 months for those with
>1 cm residual tumor.13 Data from the current study
indicate that the rates of microscopically debulked
patients were similar between the 2 racial groups, suggesting that these patients were equivalent from a surgical
cytoreductive standpoint (Table 2). In a recently published evaluation of the effect of maximal surgical cytoreduction on platinum resistance at a single institution,
those patients who were left with <1 cm residual tumor
were more likely to obtain a complete response after initial
platinum-based chemotherapy, experienced less platinum
resistance, and had improved PFS and OS compared with
patients who had >1 cm residual tumor.21 Evaluation of
the aggressiveness of surgical effort and inclusion of this
variable in the multivariate analysis of survival in the current study demonstrated that there was no difference in
surgical effort or outcome between blacks and whites who
were treated as a part of a prospective clinical trial,

eliminating this variable as a factor that contributed to
any observed racial disparity in response, toxicity or
survival.
Because the population in the current study was
homogenous with regard to residual tumor volume and
tumor grade, in the current study, we were able to assess
accurately the effect of race and dose intensity on survival
in women with advanced ovarian cancer. The majority of
studies evaluating the impact of race on ovarian cancer
survival are epidemiologic in nature and do not take into
account differences in the chemotherapy agents
received.5,6,11,22 The studies that have examined the
impact of chemotherapy on disparate ethnic and racial
survival outcomes reported chemotherapy treatment
merely as a dichotomized variable.7,10 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database evaluations
consistently have revealed a survival disadvantage for
blacks.5,9,11 The decreased 5-year survival observed for
blacks was similar in these SEER studies, with the median

survival for blacks ranging from 16 months to 22 months
compared with 23 months to 32 months for whites.5,9,11
Although none of the studies specifically addressed the
impact of chemotherapy on survival, the authors attributed the observed discrepancy in survival to older age at
diagnosis, higher grade of tumor, and lack of surgical
debulking procedures to include lymphadenectomy.
A population-based study of cases in the National
Cancer Data Base evaluated chemotherapy as a dichotomized variable and reported that blacks with advanced stage
epithelial ovarian cancer were less likely to receive the
standard combination of surgery and chemotherapy than
whites (61% vs 70%).7 Blacks more frequently underwent
surgery alone for stage I or II disease, (59% vs 47%) and
received chemotherapy alone for stage III or IV disease
(19% versus 17%). Overall, blacks were twice as likely as
whites not to receive appropriate treatment. Although
white patients with stage III disease had a 29% 5-year survival rate, black patient only had an 18% survival rate.7

The authors concluded that blacks received less aggressive
treatment and subsequently had a lower survival rate. An
evaluation of adherence to published recommendations
for chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer revealed
that only 66% of women aged >75 years, 81% of women
with stage II disease, and 81% of black women received
recommended chemotherapy.6 The reasons most frequently reported by clinicians for no chemotherapy treatment were lack of clinical indication and patient refusal.
The current study supports the hypothesis that, when
blacks with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer receive
equal treatment compared with whites, they experience
equivalent survival.
Ethnic disparities in chemotherapy toxicity also
have been reported in the literature. Poor PS and differences in pharmacologic properties have been cited as possible explanations for any disparities in chemotherapy
toxicity.23,24 In a study of patients with stage II and III
colon cancer, investigators observed that black patients
4216

experienced less overall (defined as toxicity events grade
1) GI treatment-related toxicity (ie, diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, and stomatitis) compared with white
patients.25 In the current study, 95% of patients reported
at least 1 grade 3 or 4 adverse effect, and there were no differences in severe adverse events between white patients
and black patients. However, less leukopenia and less GI
toxicity were observed among black patients compared
with white patients even after adjustment for age, PS, and
RD. Differences in toxicity result from differences in the
pharmacologic clearance of certain chemotherapeutic
agents among black patients and white patients. Our current results suggest that, for women with advanced stage
epithelial ovarian cancer, treatment with cisplatin and
paclitaxel is tolerated equally among blacks and whites
and that blacks experience fewer episodes of severe hematologic and GI toxicity.
This is an original report evaluating the potential
contribution of differences in chemotherapy dose intensity to racial disparities in survival observed between black
women and white women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. In a homogeneous population of women with
advanced epithelial ovarian cancer in whom surgical
effort, residual disease, PS, the number of cycles received,
and the percentage of treatment completion were similar
among blacks and whites, we observed no differences in
the RT, RD, or RDI. There was no difference in the ability of whites and blacks to tolerate cisplatin/paclitaxel
chemotherapy, and blacks were less likely to experience
treatment-related toxicity, including leukopenia and GI
toxicity, than their white counterparts. Most significantly,
our study demonstrated that, when they received primary
treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer as part of
a prospective clinical trial, black patients and white
patients experienced no difference in PFS or OS. Given
these results, which differ from those outcomes reported
for black women versus white women in large, population-based observational studies, all minority women who
are diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer should be
encouraged to enroll in cooperative group clinical trials as
1 strategy to reduce and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in survival.
