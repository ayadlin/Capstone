Abstract
Preclinical cellular response profiling of tumor models has become a cornerstone in the development of novel
cancer therapeutics. As efforts to predict clinical efficacy using cohorts of in vitro tumor models have been successful, expansive panels of tumor-derived cell lines can recapitulate an “all comers” efficacy trial, thereby identifying which tumors are most likely to benefit from treatment. The response profile of a therapy is most often
studied in isolation; however, drug treatment effect patterns in tumor models across a diverse panel of compounds
can help determine the value of unique molecular target classes in specific tumor cohorts. To this end, a panel of
19 compounds was evaluated against a diverse group of cancer cell lines (n = 311). The primary oncogenic targets
were a key determinant of concentration-dependent proliferation response, as a total of five of six, four of four, and
five of five phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, insulinlike growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), and mitotic inhibitors, respectively, clustered with others of that common
target class. In addition, molecular target class was correlated with increased responsiveness in certain histologies.
A cohort of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors was more efficacious in breast cancers compared with other tumor types,
whereas IGF-IR inhibitors more selectively inhibited growth in colon cancer lines. Finally, specific phenotypes play
an important role in cellular response profiles. For example, luminal breast cancer cells (nine of nine; 100%) segregated from basal cells (six of seven; 86%). The convergence of a common cellular response profile for different
molecules targeting the same oncogenic pathway substantiates a rational clinical path for patient populations
most likely to benefit from treatment. Cancer Res; 70(9); 3677–86. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The expanding development and use of targeted therapies
for cancer treatment reflects an increasing understanding of
key oncogenic pathways and how the targeted perturbation
of these pathways corresponds to clinical response. Difficulties in predicting efficacy to targeted therapies is likely a
consequence of the limited global knowledge of causal mechanisms for pathway deregulation (e.g., activating mutations and amplifications). Preclinical translational research
studies for oncology therapies focus on determining what
tumor type and genotypes are most likely to benefit from
treatment. Treating selected patient populations may help
maximize the potential of a therapy. The successful transition of preclinical tumor response profiles (i.e., those tumor

cells having maximal efficacy) to the subsequent clinical development is now well established. Numerous specific molecular markers are now used to identify patients most likely to
benefit in a clinical setting. For example, in vitro, imatinib
selectively kills cells with the activated BCR-ABL gene fusion
(1), whereas lapatinib preferentially inhibits proliferation of
ERBB2-overexpressing cells (2). Both have achieved commercial success, benefiting patients with tumors harboring these
genetic aberrations. Although inhibition of activated oncogenic pathways (normally via mutation/amplification) is
thought to be the predominant mechanism of action for
most novel cancer therapies, the diversity of compound selectivity for different targets obscures the logical association
between compound target activity and efficacy in cancer
cells. For example, the in vitro assessment of kinase inhibitory profiles of 38 unique kinase inhibitors revealed great
diversity in selectivity even for those in the same molecular
target “class” (3). The consequences of a single molecule inhibiting multiple kinases are complex and poorly understood
in the context of clinical response. Further, the inhibition of
multiple kinases not associated with the primary therapeutic
target may reveal unexpected relationships in cellular response patterns between tumors. This is likely due to the
existence of many more contributing cancer-promoting
pathways than previously thought—the result of the unique
genomic profile of each tumor. For example, comprehensive

scans for somatic mutations in breast and colon cancers indicate that each tumor harbors an average of 90 nucleotide
changes, ∼10% of which are predicted to be functionally relevant (4). All functionally significant somatic aberrations
likely influence therapeutic response to some degree.
Although the specific “signature” of genetic lesions in each
tumor likely results in a unique but predictable cellular response profile to therapeutics, to date, few have investigated
patterns of cancer cell response between different therapeutics. There is some indication that predictable patterns
may exist. Response of the JFCR39 tumor cell line panel to
a diverse set of 130 chemicals found that a majority of compounds segregate by shared mechanisms of action (5). Early
analyses of the NCI-60 tumor cell line set identified correlated patterns of proliferation response between topoisomerase inhibitors and doxorubicin (6). Identifying negative
relationships is equally as important for implementing pharmacogenomics in cancer treatment. Specific breast tumors
responding to 5-fluorouracil are resistant to Adriamycin
and docetaxel (7). High-throughput screening of a set of
tumor-derived cell lines of diverse origin is a system for studying relationships in cellular efficacy among a set of cancer
therapeutics. Here, we present a meta-analysis of tumor cell
line responsiveness to several general classes of targets, including (a) signal transduction pathway inhibitors, (b) mitotic
inhibitors, and (c) antiangiogenics (Supplementary Table S1).
When taken as a whole, response profiles are highly predictive
of compound therapeutic target class. In the case of inhibitors
of signaling pathways, response profiles correspond to the oncogenic cascade that it targets. Additionally, this study addresses how the relative specificity of individual therapies
(e.g., a lack of specificity in kinase inhibition) affects response
profiles. Finally, both individual tumor types and specific
genotypes (e.g., those harboring specific mutations) seem to
contribute to the degree of responsiveness to compounds of
different therapeutic target class.

Materials and Methods
Human cancer cell line screening panel
A total of 311 unique cancer cell lines were purchased
from several vendors (American Type Culture Collection; Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer Institute; German Resource Centre for Biological Material; and
European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures) and grown to
standard culture media recommended by the vendor (Supplementary Table S2). Typically, this included RPMI 1640
supplemented with a final concentration of 10% fetal bovine
serum, 2 mmol/L glutamax, and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate.
The cell line panel was compiled to effectively represent
common tumor types (e.g., breast, lung, and colon cancers)
as well as those tumor types that may be relevant in drug
development. This was constrained by the availability of cell
lines for certain tumor types (e.g., prostate cancers).
Nineteen compounds representing a diverse panel of cancer therapeutics were either synthesized by the Department
of Medicinal Chemistry at GlaxoSmithKline or obtained commercially (Supplementary Table S1). This includes multiple

compound inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway (n = 5), insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGFIR; n = 4), and those targeting mitosis (n = 5). Additionally,
several inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) were
included in the compound panel. Finally, data from 12 additional compounds were downloaded from resources provided by McDermott and colleagues (8). A second-tier
cluster analysis was done with the 31-compound set. Cell
lines common to both sets were matched by name.
Cell line growth inhibition assays
Phase I. A total of 289 cell lines were seeded into 384-well
microtiter plates at two densities (low and high) ranging from
300 to 3,600, depending on the rate of cell proliferation. Each
density was repeated in triplicate for every cell line. After seeding, the cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 hours. A
total of 12 compounds (Supplementary Table S1, group A)
suspended in DMSO were added to the cells by a Labcyte
Echo550 liquid handler to give final concentrations of
10 μmol/L, 3.1640 μmol/L, 1.0010 μmol/L, 316.9 nmol/L,
100.3 nmol/L, 31.7 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L, 3.2 nmol/L, 1 nmol/L,
0.3 nmol/L, and 0. One set of DMSO controls was analyzed
at the time of compound dosing to generate a time 0 data
point. For the T = 0 samples, the media were aspirated, the
cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI), and the fluorescent intensity was measured using
an InCell1000 High Content Analyzer. The remaining cells
were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. After 72 hours, the media
were aspirated and the cells were stained with DAPI and
quantified by an InCell1000 High Content Analyzer.
Phase II. A CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
kit (Promega Corp.) was used to evaluate the effects on cell
viability of seven additional compounds (Supplementary
Table S1, group B) by measuring ATP levels corresponding
to cell density. The cell lines comprising phase II, largely a
subset of those included in phase I, were selected based on
observations on growth rates and viability from the phase I
study. In addition, those cell lines of similar genetic background (see below), which showed identical response profiles
in phase I, were excluded from screening in phase II. As with
phase I, cell lines were seeded in triplicate into 384-well
microtiter plates at two densities, where each density represented a 2-fold difference for that cell line. A range of 10 concentrations of each compound was added to every culture
as described above. After incubation for 72 hours at 37°C,
100 μL of CellTiter-Glo reagent were added and luminescence was measured with a multilabel counter (Wallac).
The luminescence of compound-treated cells was compared with the average of the 24 DMSO-treated control wells
at each cell density for every concentration of compound for
all triplicate wells. The percent intensity values were used
in model 205 of XLfit in Microsoft Excel to calculate gIC50
values for the low- and high-seeding densities (a fourparameter logistical fit; model details can be found in Supplementary Materials and Methods). Specifically, the midpoint
of the growth window (the gIC50) falls halfway between the
number of cells at the time of compound addition (T = 0) and

the growth of control cells treated with DMSO at 72 hours.
The gIC50 value serves as a metric for measuring the inhibition of proliferation in cancer cells. The curves for each seeding density for every cell line were manually inspected for
both data quality and appropriateness of curve fitting. Where
the starting data were poor, the curve and subsequent gIC50
values were excluded from further analysis. Cell line seedings
were considered of poor quality when the r2 value of the
fitted curve was <0.75. Data of poor quality were removed
from all subsequent analysis.
DNA copy number analysis
DNA copy number alterations were calculated for each cell
line using the Affymetrix 500 K “SNP chip” (Affymetrix, Inc.).
DNA was extracted from each line using Mini DNeasy kit
(Qiagen, Inc.) and purified. Two aliquots (250 ng each) were
digested with the restriction enzyme Nsp or Sty (New England Biolabs). Digested DNA was subsequently ligated to an
adaptor and amplified by PCR using Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), yielding a product of approximately
250 to 2,000 bp. For each enzyme digest, PCR was carried
out in four 100 μL aliquots, pooled, purified, quantified, normalized to 40 μg/45 μL, and fragmented with DNase I to
yield a size range of approximately 25 to 200 bp. The fragmented products were labeled, denatured, and hybridized
to the Affymetrix 500 K chip. On completion of hybridization,

each assay was washed and stained using Affymetrix fluidics
stations. Image data were acquired using the GeneChip Scanner 3000. Genome-wide estimates of DNA copy number were
calculated as described by Greshock and colleagues (9). A
panel of lymphoblastic cell lines (n = 20) was used to calibrate diploid for all cancer cell lines. Additionally, to ensure
the unique genetic identity of each cell line, SNP chip genotypes were calculated using the BRLMM algorithm (10) and
compared between all cell lines. The genetic fingerprint (i.e.,
each genotype) was compared for every cell line to all other
cell lines in the set. Each comparison resulted in a “percent
identity” that represents the genetic similarity of each cell
line, where the potential values range from 0% to 100%. Cell
lines having >80% identity were considered of a similar genetic origin. Additionally, the genotype profiles of this cell
line set were compared with that published by the Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute's Cancer Genome Project (11). Those
cell lines with similar genetic profiles are noted in Supplementary Table S2. Details about the genotype comparisons
can be found in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Gene expression analysis
Transcript abundance was quantified by using the Affymetrix U133 Plus2 GeneChips in triplicate. Briefly, cell lines
were plated in triplicate and lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen Life
Technologies Co.). Lysates were captured with chloroform

NOTE: Response profiles for all compounds are represented by gIC50 values (nmol/L). Where cells were assayed at multiple plating
densities, gIC50s were averaged. Clustering analysis was done with gIC50 scaled by the overall median for each compound to
account for differences in potency. Q1 and Q3 represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, whereas n represents the total
number of cell lines assayed for each compound.

and purified using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was
prepared from 5 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript
Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and amplified using the Enzo BioArray High-Yield RNA Transcript
Labeling kit (Enzo Biochem, Inc.). Finally, the samples were
fragmented and hybridized to the HG-U133 Plus2 GeneChips, stained, and scanned according to the manufacturer's protocols. Transcript abundance was estimated by
normalizing all probe signal intensities to a value of 150
using the mas5 algorithm in the Affymetrix Microarray
Analysis Suite 5.0. Both gene expression and SNP chip data
are publicly available (12).
Compound clustering analysis
For each compound, gIC50s were first normalized to the
overall median for that compound and transformed to a
log10 scale. This produced a scaled proliferation score that
is a potency-independent means of comparing response profiles. All subsequent clustering analysis used Pearson's distance as a metric and was based on the average distance
between nodes [using code provided by de Hoon and colleagues (13)]. Tree plotting was done with the Phylodendron
software package (14).

Results/Discussion
Although all compounds elicited some degree of growth
inhibition in at least a subset of the cell line panel, response
profiles across the compound set were diverse (Supplementary Table S2; summary gIC50 values in Table 1). For example,
BEZ-235 showed relatively strong potency to induce proliferation inhibition, where 96% (188 of 196) of lines had gIC50s of
<500 nmol/L. In contrast, few cell lines showed such response levels to pazopanib (9 of 263; 3%). Overall, the antimitotic compound group induced comparatively high growth
inhibition among compound classes. In every case, the overall median (Q2; 50th percentile) was <150 nmol/L. In addition, the antimitotics exhibited response profiles distinct
from the other compounds, where the highly responsive
majority of cell lines strongly deviate from the few less responsive lines. For example, the mean gIC50 for all lines
<Q3 (75th percentile) for the PLK1 inhibitor GSK461364 is
7.6 nmol/L, whereas those >Q3 was 258 nmol/L (Fig. 1A
and C). By contrast, despite a dynamic range similar to
GSK461364, the dual ERBB1/2 RTK inhibitor lapatinib has
few responsive lines, where the mean gIC50 for those <Q1
was 1,888 nmol/L, and just 5.2% (13 of 267) had gIC50s of

Figure 1. Each of the
19 compounds had unique
proliferation profiles. This is
illustrated by plotting the gIC50
values in order of increasing
resistance. A, the PLK1 inhibitor
GSK461364 potently inhibits
proliferation in a majority of cell
lines (median gIC50 = 9 nmol/L).
B, comparatively, the ERBB1/2
inhibitor lapatinib has few sensitive
cell lines. C, a comparison of the
PLK1 inhibitor GSK461364 and
paclitaxel shows how the
antimitotic profiles were highly
correlated. The small number of
highly resistant cell lines (defined
as those >Q3) was common
between this class of compounds.
D, a quartile comparison for
GSK461364 and paclitaxel
indicates a significant correlation
when analyzed by χ2 (P = 0.002;
cell line gIC50 values are binned by
quartile range for each compound).

Molecular Target Class

Figure 2. Global clustering of scaled
proliferation scores of 19 cancer
compounds delineates positive
correlations between those of similar
therapeutic target. These include
inhibitors of IGF-IR (cluster A),
PI3K/AKT/mTOR (cluster B), and those
compounds targeting mitosis (cluster C).
The compounds with the smallest and
largest Pearson's distance are depicted
as the darkest shades of blue and red,
respectively. The most correlated
compound profiles were the IGF-IR
inhibitors GSK1904529 and PQIP
(Pearson's distance = 0.21), whereas
the most negatively correlated
compounds are GSK1070916 and
TGX-221 (Pearson's distance = 1.25).

<150 nmol/L (Fig. 1B). This suggests that inhibiting mitosis is
more uniformly effective in slowing cellular proliferation for
in vitro tumor models. Conversely, relative to other classes,
inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway showed more diverse potency, where Q3 ranged from <150 nmol/L (BEZ-235)
to >10,000 nmol/L (perifosine). This profound disparity is
likely the result of unique targeting strategies (i.e., where in
the pathway) and differential potency between inhibitors of
this pathway.
Compounds of similar target classes associate by the
hierarchical clustering of their median-scaled proliferation
inhibition scores (Fig. 2). In other words, specific compound
target classes are predictive of which specific cell lines are
most responsive to increasing drug concentrations. The
overall degree of correlation between compounds of similar
target classes is, in part, likely a manifestation of the variable
levels of growth and survival dependence each cell line has
on the activation of different oncogenic pathways. This is
shown by the fact that compounds of a common molecular
target class cluster together due to similar subsets of cell
lines showing high levels of dose-dependent response. For
example, all four inhibitors of IGF-IR cluster together due
to strongly associated in vitro profiles [mean Pearson's
distance of 0.34 (± 0.10; n = 6) compared with an overall
mean distance of 0.88 (± 0.19; n = 145); Fig. 2, cluster A]. In
contrast, although four of five drugs targeting the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway do cluster together (Fig. 2, cluster B), their
association is considerably weaker than that of IGF-IR inhibitors (mean distance = 0.63 ± 0.15; n = 10). This likely reflects
the more diverse means of targeting this pathway by this set
of compounds or that each of these targets (PI3K/AKT/
mTOR) has slightly unique signaling outcomes. Selective inhibitors of AKT and mTOR target this pathway downstream

of those targeting PI3K directly. The two pan-isoform PI3K
inhibitors in this study, BEZ-235 and GSK1059615, have notable and direct inhibition of mTOR kinase, which makes the
relationships of their response profiles with other pathway
inhibitors more complex. The correlation between these inhibitors was not driven by structural similarity. For example,
two more strongly correlated members of this panel of inhibitors, the AKT inhibitor GSK690693 and the PI3K inhibitor
GSK1059615 (Pearson's distance = 0.54), are structurally
distinct (Supplementary Table S3). The mitosis-inhibiting
compounds (PLK/AURK/CENPE/tubulin) also strongly correlate, where five of five members of cluster C (Fig. 2) are
of this class. The mean Pearson's distance for the pairwise
comparison of these is 0.56 (± 0.11; n = 10). The specific
mitotic targets of these compounds are largely unique, and
their clustering is consistent with previous observations that
the biological process targeted (mitosis in this case) can
drive similarities in cellular response (15). The few cell lines
whose proliferation is not affected by treatment with an
antimitotic help define this compound cluster. For example,
the high correlation of those lines >Q3 contributes to the correlation between GSK461364 and paclitaxel (Fig. 1C), a statistically significant relationship by χ2 analysis when binning
cell lines by quartile (γ = 0.34, P = 0.002; Fig. 1D; ref. 16). It
is likely that the medium conditions conducive to high rates
of cellular proliferation produce an artificially high response
rate to those compounds targeting mitosis (17).
Clustering analysis also suggests logical relationships between the response profiles of the compounds not in one
of these major classes. For example, the closest member to
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cluster is lapatinib, an inhibitor of
the ERBB1/2 RTKs that signal through PI3K. Genomic
aberrations to ERBB1/2, which have been correlated with

Greshock et al.

cellular response to lapatinib (2), can activate PI3K signaling. Conversely, direct activation of PI3K via mutations to
PIK3CA confers resistance to trastuzumab, another upstream
inhibitor of ERBB2 (18). In other words, some, but not all,
cell lines that respond to PI3K/AKT inhibition do not
respond to upstream inhibition of the ERBB1/2 RTKs. The
clustering of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)
inhibitor GSK1120212 remains separate from those compounds
targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and lapatinib. This
relationship is likely the result of the high importance of activated RAS/RAF in those cells that are more responsive to MEK
inhibition (19).
The reclustering of the 19 compounds from the initial
study with additional proliferation inhibition data from
12 compounds presented by McDermott and colleagues (8)
further illustrates that therapeutic target selectivity is predictive of cell line response profiles (Fig. 3). For example, the
node containing the ERBB1 inhibitor erlotinib and the
ERBB1/2 inhibitor HKI-272 cluster with the other RTK inhi-

bitor lapatinib (cluster D) in this histologically diverse panel
of cell lines (n = 117). In addition, the lone additional mitotic
inhibitor MK0457, which targets Aurora kinases (AURK),
clusters with the five other mitotic inhibitors. Similarly, the
c-MET inhibitor PHA665752 clusters with GSK1363089 (foretinib), whereas the RAF inhibitor AZ628 clusters with the
MEK inhibitor GSK1120212. Although these results show that
the primary target is the dominant driver of gross cell line
response profiles, the potent inhibition of additional targets
and degree of selectivity play a role in these relationships.
Only two of four compounds known to potently inhibit
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) components
(pazopanib, foretinib, sunitinib, and sorafenib) cluster together (Fig. 3, cluster E). Sunitinib, a potent inhibitor of
VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptors (20), clusters with pazopanib. Sorafenib, a potent
inhibitor of VEGFR, RAF, and numerous other kinases (21),
does not cluster with other inhibitors of VEGFR. This is not
surprising, as a direct comparison of these three inhibitors of
tumor vasculature reveals that each potently inhibits a

Molecular Target Class

Figure 4. Inhibitors of the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are
selectively active in breast cancer
cells, whereas those compounds
targeting IGF-IR more potently
inhibit proliferation in colon cancer
cells. This is shown by a direct
comparison of gIC50 values
of breast, colon, lung, and
hematopoietic tumor cells
(n > 15 cell lines per tumor type).
Bars in this graph represent the
average-scaled gIC50 value for
each compound by tumor type.
Among these four tumor types,
breast cancer cells have the lowest
median-scaled gIC50 values for
four of five PI3K/AKT/mTOR
inhibitors, whereas colon cancer
cell had the lowest scores for all
four IGF-IR inhibitors tested.

unique set of kinases known to be involved in tumorigenesis
and progression (22). It is likely that inhibiting these additional kinases drives proliferation response, as cell lines do
not serve as faithful models of tumor vasculature in twodimensional cell culture. In the case of sorafenib, the inhibition of kinases unique to this compound (compared
with that of foretinib and sunitinib) is more critical in
determining cellular response in vitro. In addition, although
sunitinib and sorafenib show comparable benefit as secondline treatment of cytokine-refractory kidney cancers (23), it
is not known if the same patients would benefit from each
therapy.
Relationships between cluster groups also show rational
patterns of cell line response that are not directly related
to the target but rather the cascading of cellular signaling.
For example, inhibitors of the RTKs ERBB1/2, in addition
to the SRC inhibitor AZD0530 [also shown to selectively inhibit growth of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–
activated cells (8)], cluster with inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/
mTOR. Although it is established that the RTKs inhibited
by these compounds (ERBB1/2) modulate PI3K/AKT/mTOR
in numerous human cancers, the relationship between PI3K/
AKT/mTOR activity and clinical response to RTK inhibition
is complex and only partially understood. For instance, activating mutations of the PIK3CA gene confer resistance to
EGFR inhibition (24) while correlating with sensitivity to
compounds targeting PI3K directly (25).
The observed compound class clustering associations are
consistent with previous pharmacogenomic studies, showing
that cell line response to therapeutics is dependent on
both genotype and cellular origin (8). When considering
the response data for cells of breast, colon, lung, and hematopoietic origin in the original panel of 19 compounds (those

tissue types represented by at least 15 cell lines), inhibitors of
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway show increased selectivity for
inhibiting the growth of breast cells (Fig. 4). Perifosine, which
exhibited little growth inhibition in this cell line panel, was
the lone exception. The selective growth inhibition in breast
cancer cells by this class of compounds is expected, as this
pathway is shown to be frequently activated by mutations
of PIK3CA (26) and is of importance in driving breast cancer
cell growth (27). Hence, breast cancers may represent a
favorable clinical target for this emerging class of therapeutics. Similarly, four of four IGF-IR inhibitors showed uniform
selectivity of colon cancer cell lines when compared with the
other tumor types. The preferential efficacy of IGF-IR inhibition in colon cancer cells is consistent with the frequently
observed expression of the IGF-IR in colon cancers when
compared with other tumor types, where it is not promoting
tumorigenicity (28).
Overexpression of estrogen receptor (ER), which stimulates cell division and DNA replication in ∼70% of breast
cancers, serves as a pathologic marker for diagnosis and
treatment. The discrimination of the luminal A subtype from
other molecular subtypes of breast cancers is defined largely
by overexpression of ER and amplification of ERBB2 (29).
These markers have profound implications for breast cancer
prognosis and survival (18) and correlate with cellular
response to therapeutics such as dasatinib (30) and lapatinib
(2). It is then not surprising that ER-overexpressing breast
cancer cell lines segregate from those with low ER expression
(P = 0.010, Fisher's exact test; Fig. 5). This relationship is
even stronger when considering molecular classifications
defined by Sorlie and colleagues (29), where six of seven
(86%) and nine of nine (100%) cell lines of basal and luminal subtypes cluster with their respective primary tumor

Figure 5. The clustering of median-scaled gIC50 values shows that cellular genotype is a strong driver of organization of 16 breast cancer cell lines
(columns). Luminal breast cancer cells, most of which associate with ER overexpression, segregate from the basal breast cancer lines (P = 0.0009, Fisher's
exact test). Green and red cells represent cell lines with lower and higher gIC50 values, respectively, whereas gray cells indicate missing data. The
organization of compounds (rows) is similar to that when all tumor types are analyzed (e.g., inhibitors of PI3K/AKT and IGF-IR cluster together).

subtypes (P = 0.0009). Notably, luminal cells preferentially respond to the AKT inhibitor GSK690693 and the PI3K inhibitor GSK1069615, whereas the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212
selectively inhibits proliferation in basal breast cancers. This
result is not surprising because PI3K activation can mediate
resistance to MEK inhibition (31). Although, collectively, this
suggests a strongly divergent clinical path for targeting these
pathways in breast cancers, the coinhibition of MAPK and
PI3K may be particularly efficacious in the basal subtype
(32). Mutations in PIK3CA and PTEN do not seem to associ-

ate with compound clusters (P > 0.05), suggesting that these
alterations are of secondary importance to ER and ERBB2
in determining what cell lines are more responsive across
this diverse panel of compounds. Similarly, when analyzing
tumor types with frequent KRAS mutations (colon and
pancreatic cancers), those cell lines harboring mutant KRAS
tended to cluster together (P = 0.14, Fisher's exact test;
Supplementary Fig. S1). This trend is even more profound
when distinguishing those harboring KRAS mutations with
wild-type PIK3CA (P = 0.008, Fisher's exact test). The unique

sensitivity profile of KRAS-mutated cell lines is an expected
result, as mutations to this gene correlate with clinical response patterns, such as resistance to inhibitors of EGFR
(33). The fact that not all KRAS-mutant tumors cluster
together is also concordant with previous observations
that mutations that co-occur with KRAS can drive cellular response to therapeutics, such as the association of
cooperating LKB1/KRAS mutations with more exquisite response to MEK inhibition (34).
This study shows that although kinase selectivity of cancer
therapeutics can vary greatly (3), the predominant targets of
these therapies play a major role in determining inhibition of
cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The
similarity in concentration-response profiles among multiple inhibitors targeting a common oncogenic pathway
emphasizes how inhibition of that specific pathway is a key
cellular response mechanism. In addition, the unique but
consistent profiles from distinct therapeutic target classes
(e.g., PI3K/AKT/mTOR versus IGF-IR) are suggestive of divergent clinical strategies for these compounds. Large panels of
tumor-derived cell lines show response affinities for molecular target classes with specific tumor types (as was the
cases with PI3K/AKT/mTOR and IGF-IR inhibitors for breast
and colon cancer cells, respectively). Further, cellular response profiles among classes show genotype specificity,
exemplified by the congregation of luminal/basal breast
cancer cells across compounds of diverse target classes.
These results also show that cell culture is a largely faithful
model of primary tumors with respect to drug response, par-

ticularly for those compounds targeting signal transduction
pathways. In contrast, hyperphysiologic growth conditions
may hinder the accurate modeling of drug response of some
compound target classes, such as those designed to inhibit
mitosis. This notion may become increasingly important in
the future of cancer drug development as target classes
expand to include those selectively obstructing tumor metabolism because specific cell culture conditions can
drastically affect metabolic activity (35). Collectively, the
high-throughput screening of cancer therapeutics across a
histologically and genetically varied cell line population can
simulate clinical response profiles and identify both tumor
types and genotypes that may benefit most from specific
treatment regimens.
