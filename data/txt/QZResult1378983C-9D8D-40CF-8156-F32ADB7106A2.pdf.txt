Abstract
The Notch pathway plays an important role in the growth of high-grade serous ovarian (HGS-OvCa) and other
cancers, but its clinical and biologic mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we found that the Notch pathway
alterations are prevalent and signiﬁcantly related to poor clinical outcome in patients with ovarian cancer.
Particularly, Notch3 alterations, including ampliﬁcation and upregulation, were highly associated with poor
patient survival. Targeting Notch3 inhibited ovarian cancer growth and induced apoptosis. Importantly, we found
that dynamin-mediated endocytosis was required for selectively activating Jagged-1–mediated Notch3 signaling. Cleaved Notch3 expression was the critical determinant of response to Notch-targeted therapy. Collectively,
these data identify previously unknown mechanisms underlying Notch3 signaling and identify new, biomarkerdriven approaches for therapy. Cancer Res; 74(12); 3282–93. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Notch signaling has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis
processes such as vessel maturation; pericyte recruitment;
branching; and cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival.
In mammalian cells, this pathway comprises ﬁve transmembrane Notch ligands [Jagged-1, Jagged-2, Delta-like ligand
(DLL) 1, DLL3, and DLL4] and four Notch receptors
(Notch1–4). Mature Notch receptors are assembled as heterodimeric proteins, with each dimer comprised of a large extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single-pass transmembrane
domain, and a smaller cytoplasmic subunit (Notch intracellular domain, NICD; ref. 1). The activation of Notch signaling
requires endocytosis and trafﬁcking of both notch receptor
and ligand. Upon ligand–receptor binding, it leads to cleavage
of the Notch receptor via intramembrane proteolysis by the

gamma-secretase complex (including pesenilin, nicastin,
APH1 and PEN2) and results in consequent release of NICD.
The NICD fragment then enters the nucleus and interacts with
nuclear DNA-binding factor, CSL (suppressor of hailess/LAG-1,
RBPJK) to regulate transcription of the basic helix-loop-helix
genes, hairy and enhancer-of-split genes, and Notch target
genes (2, 3).
However, the biologic role of Notch pathway alterations in
cancer growth and the clinical effects of these alterations are
not well understood (4–7). In the present study, we performed
an integrated and systematic analysis of the clinical relevance
of the Notch pathway in high-grade serous ovarian cancer
(HGS-OvCa) and identiﬁed novel mechanisms of Notch3
activation.

Materials and Methods
The Cancer Genome Atlas clinical analysis
Access to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was
approved by the National Cancer Institute. The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center approved a waiver for
performing our survival analysis with deidentiﬁed data. Demographic characteristics and clinical data of patients with HGSOvCa (histopathologic information, treatment, and outcome
parameters) were downloaded from the data portal for TCGA
(http://tcga.cancer.gov; Supplementary Table S1).
The survival analysis output for the 316 study patients
and complete information [overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival duration, expression, mutation, copy
number] were downloaded from the cBio Cancer Portal for
Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/). Also,
complete survival and gene expression information for our
OS and progression-free survival analysis of 453 and 373
patients with HGS-OvCa, respectively, were downloaded
from TCGA. The mean age of the patients at diagnosis and

tumor stage (as deﬁned by the International Federation of
Gynecology and Obstetrics), tumor grade, and surgical outcomes (residual tumor size) reﬂected those in individuals
typically diagnosed with HGS-OvCa. The patients' tumor
specimens had been resected before systemic treatment. All
the patients had received a platinum agent, and 94% had
received a taxane. The platforms used were described in the
TCGA article (4).
Copy-number alterations were analyzed using the Human
Genome CGH Microarrays (244 k, 415 K, or 1 M platforms;
Agilent Technologies), and focally ampliﬁed regions were
identiﬁed using a modiﬁed method (4). Level 3 gene expression
data were generated using three platforms: Agilent Technologies, GeneChip Human Exon ST Array (Affymetrix), and
GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). We
downloaded the Notch2–4 mutation data from TCGA (Supplementary Table S1); these data were generated using the
Genome Analyzer IIx platform (Illumina) and the ABI SOLiD
3 System (Life Technologies/Applied Biosystems).
Cell lines and cell culture
Ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR3, OVCAR5, OVCAR420,
SKOV3, SKOV3 TR, HeyA8, HeyA8 MDR, A2780, IGROV1,
A2774, and HIO180) and the uterine cancer cell line (Ishikawa)
were obtained from the MD Anderson Characterized Cell Line
Core Facility (Houston, Texas), which supplies authenticated
cell lines. The cell lines were routinely tested to conﬁrm the
absence of mycoplasma, and all experiments were performed
with cell lines at 60% to 80% conﬂuence.
OVCAR420, OVCAR3, SKOV3, SKOV3 TR, HeyA8, HeyA8
MDR, A2780, and IGROV1 cells were maintained and propagated in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% to 15%
FBS and 0.1% gentamicin sulfate (Gemini Bio-Products). The
medium used for the HeyA8 MDR and SKOV3 TR cells contained 100 nmol/L docetaxel. OVCAR5 cells were maintained
and propagated in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium/highglucose medium supplemented with 15% FBS and 0.1% gentamicin sulfate. HIO180 and A2774 cell cultures were maintained in 10% Modiﬁed Eagle Medium.
Reagents and antibodies
Gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) was provided by Pﬁzer
(New York, New York). Paclitaxel was purchased from the
MD Anderson pharmacy. Notch3, Jagged-1, RPS6KB1, dynamin (DNM)1–3, control siRNAs, and dynasore were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Primers included PSEN1, APH1A,
NCSTN, APH1B, PSENEN, RPS6KB1, DNM1–3, and 18s were
also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies used in this
study included Jagged-1, Jagged-2, DLL1, DLL4, P70S6K
(RPS6KB1), Notch1–4, and cleaved Notchs and were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-DLL3 antibody was
obtained from Abcam. b-Actin was purchased from SigmaAldrich. CD31 was purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-Ki67
antibody was purchased from Neomarkers. Antibody against
cleaved caspase-3 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated rat antimouse IgG2a was purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for
Science.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed to detect expression of
Notch family members [Jagged-1, Jagged-2, DLL1, DLL3, DLL4,
Notch1–4, and cleaved Notch (NICDs)] in a panel of ovarian
cancer cells. Cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (50 mmol/L
Tris-cl pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride), 1
Roche complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C. Protein concentrations were then
measured using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Hercules, California). After loading the protein (25 mg/well), we separated
bands on an 8% to 10% gel using sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Bands were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% milk for 1
hour at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies against Notch1–4, Jagged-1, Jaged-2, and DLL4 (1:1,000
dilution) and DLL3 (1:2,000 dilution) overnight at 4 C. The
samples were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or
anti-rabbit antibodies (GE Healthcare) for 1 hour at room
temperature. Blots were developed using an enhanced Chemiluminescence Detection Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford,
Illinois). Actin was used as a loading control, and all experiments were performed in duplicate. Densitometry was performed using the ImageJ software program to interpret differences in Western blot analysis results.
RT-PCR
Relative expression of the gamma-secretase complex
(PSEN1, NCSTN, APH1A, APH1B, and PSENEN) were detected
using qRT-PCR. Dynamin expression was detected using RTPCR. Each RT-PCR was carried out with 500 ng of total RNA
isolated from treated ovarian cancer cells using an RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using
an ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems)
with a SensiMix SYBR Low-ROX Kit (Bioline USA). Relative
quantiﬁcation of gene expression was performed using the
2DDCt method. The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
In vitro siRNA transfection
All cell lines were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen) using either control or target siRNAs
(Sigma-Aldrich) as speciﬁed in Supplementary Table S2
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated
in a 6-well plate 24 hours before incubation. For 1-well transfection, we added 2 mg of target siRNA (1 mg/mL) and 6 mL of
Lipofectamine 2,000 to 100 mL of serum-free medium, and the
mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature.
During transfection, we washed the 6-well plates once with
2 mL of PBS and then added 100 mL of the mixture along with
1 mL of serum-free medium to the plates. After 4 to 6 hours
of transfection, the medium was replaced with a medium
containing FBS.
Apoptosis, cell cycle, and anoikis assays
Apoptosis in the ovarian cancer cells was evaluated using an
Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences). Cells
were incubated in trypsin-EDTA, and cell pellets were

suspended in 1 mL of 1 Annexin V binding buffer. We
incubated 100 mL of each cell suspension with 5 mL of Annexin
V and 5 mL of 7-aminoactinomycin D at room temperature
(25 C) in the dark for 30 minutes. Following this incubation,
400 mL of 1 binding buffer was added to each tube, and
specimens were analyzed using an XL 4-color ﬂow cytometer.
Each experiment was repeated three times.
For cell-cycle analysis, we synchronized the treated cells
by maintaining them in serum-free media for 24 hours. The
cells were then trypsinized, washed with PBS, and ﬁxed in
70% cold ethanol overnight at 4 C. Cells were then centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C. After washing
with PBS, cells were suspended in propidium iodide (Roche
Diagnostics) at 50 mg/mL and RNAse A (Qiagen) at 100
mg/ml and incubated in the dark at room temperature. We
then determined the cell-cycle status using ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting.
For anoikis analysis, 2.0  105 ovarian cancer cells were
seeded on a 6-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, cells were
transfected with siRNA. After 24 hours of transfection, 2.5  105
cells were lifted and plated on a 6-well poly(2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate)-treated plate in serum-free mito-PLUS medium
and incubated for 72 hours at 37 C in a 5% carbon dioxide
atmosphere. After incubation, detached and suspended cells
were harvested in RPMI1640 medium and centrifuged at 500 
g for 10 minutes. Pellets were washed with PBS and ﬁxed with
ice-cold 75% (v/v) ethanol overnight at 4 C. After ﬁxation, cells
were washed with PBS and stained with 500 mL of a propidium
iodide solution (50 mg/mL in PBS) containing 25 mg/mL RNase
A. Cells were incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes and analyzed
using ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting.
Cytotoxicity assays
Ovarian cancer cells were plated in a 96-well plate and
cultured overnight. Cells were then exposed to 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2,
4, 6, 8, or 10 mmol/L of GSI for 72 hours. Control cells were
treated with a vehicle at equal concentrations. To assess cell
viability, we added 50 mL of 0.15% MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) to
each well and incubated the well-plate for 2 hours at 37 C.
The medium containing MTT was then removed, and 100 mL
of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each
well. Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 10
minutes. The absorbance was read at 570 nm using a 96-well
Synergy HT multi-mode microplate reader (Ceres UV 900 C;
BioTek). Cell viability was deﬁned as the percentage of viable
cells in the treatment group relative to viable cells in the
control group. The experiments were repeated separately at
least three times.
Microarray analysis of Notch3 downstream genes
We analyzed the silencing of Notch3 with the Illumina cDNA
microarray platform as described previously (8). Brieﬂy, Notch3
in OVCAR3 cells was silenced in vitro using Notch3 siRNAs, and
Notch3 silencing was conﬁrmed via Western blot analysis. For
microarray hybridization, total RNA was extracted from ovarian cancer cells transfected with control siRNA or human
Notch3 siRNA using a mirVana RNA isolation labeling kit
(Ambion). We used 500 ng of total RNA to label and hybridize

3284

the cells according to Illumina's protocols. After we scanned
bead chips (Sentrix HumanHT-12 v3, Illumina) using an Illumina BeadArray reader, we normalized the microarray data
using the quantile normalization method with the Linear
Models for Microarray Data software program in the R language (Denton; ref. 9). The level of expression of each gene was
transformed into a log2 base before additional analysis was
performed. Genes that were differentially expressed in control
and Notch3-silenced cells were identiﬁed using a randomvariance t test; gene expression differences were considered
statistically signiﬁcant if their P values were less than 0.001. A
stringent signiﬁcance threshold was used to limit the number
of false-positive ﬁndings.
In addition, cluster analysis was performed using the Cluster
and TreeView software programs (10). The NetWalker software
program was used for gene network analysis (11).
In vivo mouse models
Female athymic nude mice (NCr-nu) were purchased from
the Animal Production Area of the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research. The animals were kept under
speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions in facilities approved by the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care International and in agreement with current
regulations and standards of the United States Department
of Health and Human Services, the United States Department
of Agriculture, and the NIH. Mice used in these experiments
were 8- to 12-week-old.
To generate tumors in the mice, we trypsinized subconﬂuent
cultures of OVCAR5, A2780, and SKOV3 cells, mixed the cells
with a medium containing 10% FBS, centrifuged the mixture at
1,000 rpm for 5 minutes, and washed the cells in PBS. Mice were
then injected intraperitoneally with 1  106 OVCAR5, A2780, or
SKOV3 cells. In the OVCAR5 and A2780 models, mice were
randomized into four treatment groups of 10 mice each: control
siRNA, control siRNA with paclitaxel, Notch3 siRNA, and Notch3
siRNA with paclitaxel. In the SKOV3 model, mice were randomized into two treatment groups: control siRNA and Notch3
siRNA. Treatments were initiated 8 days after tumor cell injection. Control and Notch3 siRNA were conjugated with chitosan
(CH; ref. 8), which we injected into the tail vein twice weekly (150
mg/kg per mouse). Paclitaxel was administered intraperitoneally
once weekly (4 mg/kg/mouse). Mice were monitored daily and
weighed weekly. All of the mice were subjected to necropsy
when the control mice became moribund, which was approximately 28 days after A2780 cell injection, 35 days after OVCAR5
cell injection, and 38 days after SKOV3 cell injection. Each
mouse's total body weight and the location, weight, and number
of tumors were recorded. Tumor specimens processed for
further analysis were either preserved in optimum cutting
temperature medium (Miles Laboratories; for frozen sectioning)
or ﬁxed in formalin (for parafﬁn embedment).
To further validate target modulation (cleaved Notch3, Hes1,
and RPS6KB1) in the tumor tissues obtained from the in vivo
A2780 model, ovarian cancer cells were injected intraperitoneally into the mice. Three weeks later, the mice were randomly allocated to two treatment groups (n ¼ 5/group):
(i) control, (ii) dynasore (60 mg/kg i.p. for two treatments,

72 hours apart). Tumor tissues were collected for Western blot
analysis.
Immunohistochemical staining
Parafﬁn-embedded orthotopic tumor specimens were used
in immunohistochemical staining to detect cell proliferation
(with Ki67), apoptosis (with cleaved caspase-3), and Notch3
expression. Tumor sections were deparafﬁnized, rehydrated,
and transferred to PBS. After retrieving the antigens with
citrate buffer (pH 6.0), we blocked the sections with 3%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol and protein blocker at room
temperature. The sections were then incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti-Ki67 antibody (1:200; Neomarkers), antiNotch3 antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anticleaved caspase-3 antibody (1:100; Biocare Medical) overnight
at 4 C. After being washed with PBS, the sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG2a (1:100; Harlan Bioproducts for Science).
For CD31 detection, frozen sections were ﬁxed in cold
acetone for 15 minutes, washed with PBS, blocked with protein
blocker (4% ﬁsh gel), and then incubated with rat monoclonal
anti-mouse CD31 (1:800; PharMingen) overnight at 4 C. They
were then washed with PBS and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 hour. Reactive tissues were visualized using
staining with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (Research Genetics) and
followed by counterstaining with Gil hematoxylin (BioGenex
Laboratories).
To quantify Ki67, cleaved caspase-3, and Notch3, the percentage of positive cells was determined in ﬁve random 0.159mm2 ﬁelds at 200 magniﬁcation. To quantify microvessel
density (MVD) for each sample, the microvessels within ﬁve
randomly selected 0.159-mm2 ﬁelds were counted at 200
magniﬁcation. A single microvessel was deﬁned as a discrete
cluster for CD31 positivity.

(deﬁned as ampliﬁcation, upregulation or downregulation of
expression, mutation, or homozygous deletion) most frequently (17%, 16%, 15%, and 9% of cases, respectively; Fig. 1A).
In total, 61% of the HGS-OvCa cases had alterations of at least
one of the Notch pathway–related genes. Patients with these
alterations had shorter OS durations than did those without
the altered genes (median, 36.2 vs. 53.2 months; P ¼ 0.001;
Fig. 1B). The types of alterations for each of the nine genes
are shown in Fig. 1C. Notch pathway alterations were not
signiﬁcantly associated with other clinical parameters, including tumor stage (as deﬁned by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics), grade, and residual
tumor size (Supplementary Table S1A and S1C). Mutations
of Notch2–4 did not occur frequently in HGS-OvCa cases
(Supplementary Table S1B), and there were no alterations in
Notch1 or DLL1.
We next focused speciﬁcally on Notch3 due to its frequent
alterations. Patients with Notch3 alterations had signiﬁcantly
shorter OS durations than did patients without these alterations (median, 35.3 vs. 52.2 months; P ¼ 0.0005; Fig. 2A).
Furthermore, patients with ampliﬁcation, increased expression, and mutation of Notch3 genes had signiﬁcantly shorter OS
durations than did those without these alterations (median OS
duration, 33.6 vs. 53.2 months; P ¼ 0.0014; Fig. 2B). Notch3
ampliﬁcation alone was not associated with OS duration, but
there was a trend of shorter OS duration in patients with
ampliﬁcation (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Notch3 expression was
correlated with its ampliﬁcation (P < 0.001; Fig. 2C), according

Statistical analysis
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to generate time-toprogression and survival curves. The statistical analysis was
performed with the R statistical computing language (version
2.11.0; http://www.r-project.org/), and statistical signiﬁcance
was set at 0.05. For analysis of categorical data (tumor stage,
tumor grade, and residual tumor size), the Fisher exact test was
used to calculate P values. For in vivo data analysis, differences
in continuous variables (mean body weight, tumor weight,
tumor-cell proliferation, and apoptosis) were analyzed using
the Mann–Whitney rank-sum test.

Results
Clinical signiﬁcance of alterations of the core Notch and
related genes
To determine the clinical relevance of alterations of the core
Notch and related genes, including Notch ligands (Jagged-1,
Jagged-2, DLL1, DLL3, and DLL4), Notch receptors (Notch1–4),
and Notch-interacting genes (SNW1, CNTN1), we ﬁrst examined the effect of these alterations on survival duration in 316
patients with HGS-OvCa from the TCGA dataset. We found
that Notch3, DLL3, SNW1, and Jag1 were the genes altered

to Spearman correlation analysis. Notch3 overexpression was
also signiﬁcantly correlated with the GATA2 and C/EBP transcription factors based on Spearman correlation analysis
(Supplementary Table S3). Importantly, we identiﬁed a significant correlation between Jagged-1 and Notch3 expression in
HGS-OvCa samples as well as in breast, uterine, and kidney
cancers (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S1B; Table 1). Notch3
ampliﬁcation and upregulation were also signiﬁcantly correlated with shorter survival in patients with uterine cancer
(median OS duration, 56 months); patients without these
alterations were still alive at the end of this study (P ¼
0.0008; Fig. 2E).
Biologic effects of Notch3 and cleaved Notch3 in cancer
cells
We ﬁrst used Western blot analysis to screen a panel of OvCa
cell lines for expression of Notch family members (Fig. 3A and
B). We selected both cleaved Notch3 (NICD3)-positive
(OVCAR3, OVCAR5, and A2780) and NICD3-negative (SKOV3,

SKOV3 TR, and IGROV1) OvCa cells for additional in vitro and
in vivo studies. After transfecting cancer cells with Notch3
siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2A), we noticed high levels of
apoptosis in the NICD3-positive cells (Fig. 3C–E), but not in the
NICD3-negative cells (Fig. 3F–H); these results suggest that
NICD3 expression is an important determinant of the biologic
functions of Notch3 in cancer cells. Furthermore, compared
with control cells, anoikis increased greatly in NICD3-positive
cells transfected with Notch3 siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Notch3 siRNA also induced cell-cycle arrest in the G2–M phase
in NICD3-positive cells, but not in NICD3-negative cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
To determine whether the cleaved Notch3 is a determinant
of sensitivity to Notch-targeted therapy, we treated human
epithelial OvCa cells (OVCAR5, OVCAR3, SKOV3, HeyA8, and
A2780) with a GSI at various concentrations for 72 hours and
assessed cell viability. The IC50s of GSI ranged from 3.06 to 7.73
mmol/L. The NICD3-positive cells (A2780, OVCAR3, and
OVCAR5) were more sensitive to treatment with GSI than

were the NICD3-negative cells (SKOV3 and HeyA8; Fig. S2D).
GSI-based treatment induced substantially more apoptosis in
the NICD3-positive cells than in the NICD3-negative cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2E).
Because Notch3 siRNA arrested cells in the G2–M phase, we
examined whether Notch3 siRNA could enhance sensitivity to
paclitaxel. We found that silencing Notch3 signiﬁcantly
enhanced the sensitivity of OVCAR3 cells to treatment with
paclitaxel (P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S2F–S2G)
Dynamin-dependent endocytosis is required for Jag1mediated Notch3 activation
Next, we considered potential explanations for selective
cleaved Notch3 expression in cancer cell lines. Given the role
of the gamma-secretase complex (PSEN1, APH1A, NCSTN,
APH1B, and PSENEN) in Notch proteolysis, we ﬁrst used
qRT-PCR to examine the expression of the gamma-secretase
complex in the panel of OvCa cells. These ﬁve genes were not
differentially expressed between the NICD3-positive or -negative cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Because there was no
association between the gamma-secretase complex and
cleaved Notch3 expression, we next used TCGA data and the
Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient to analyze the relationship between Notch3 and its potential ligands in patients with
HGS-OvCa. There was a signiﬁcant correlation between
Notch3 and Jagged-1 expression in HGS-OvCa as well as other
cancers, including cancers of the uterus, breast, and kidney (P <
0.0001; Table 1). Therefore, we next evaluated whether Jagged-1
stimulation could induce Notch3 proteolysis in NICD3-negative SKOV3 cells. Whereas treatment with recombinant human
Jagged-1 (rhJagged-1; 10 mg/mL) at 48 hours increased cleaved
Notch3 expression in these cells compared with controls (Fig.

www.aacrjournals.org

4A), Jagged-1 silencing did not decrease cleaved Notch3 levels
in NICD3-positive cells (Fig. 4B).These ﬁndings prompted us to
consider whether endocytosis may be involved in Notch3
activation.
To determine whether endocytosis is involved in Notch3
proteolysis, OVCAR3 cells were treated with dynasore, a cellpermeable inhibitor of dynamin. Cleaved Notch3 expression
was decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C
and D). Dynasore treatment indeed increased the expression of
full Notch3 expression at lower doses and at 1 to 24 hours, likely
due to its rapid effect on inhibiting Notch3 receptor degradation, but this treatment decreased full Notch3 and Jagged-1 at
higher doses and 48 hours (Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary
Fig. S4A). Importantly, dynasore prevented Jagged-1–stimulated cleaved Notch3 expression in the NICD3-negative cells
(SKOV3 cells, HeyA8, and 2774), suggesting that endocytosis
was required for Jagged-1–mediated Notch3 activation (Fig. 4E;
Supplementary Fig. S4B). Next, to identify which dynamins are
involved in this endocytotic process to activate Notch3, we
screened a panel of OvCa cells for expression of DNM1, DNM2,
and DNM3. Among these, DNM1 and DNM2 were expressed in
all the cells tested, but DNM3 was present only in some cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4C). We then treated the OVCAR3 cells
with DNM1, DNM2, or DNM3 siRNA or pools of two or three of
these dynamin siRNAs (Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Fig. S4D). Treatment with the pools of three dynamin
siRNAs resulted in much lower cleaved expression in the
OVCAR3 cells than did treatment with the individual siRNA
duplexes (Fig. 4F), demonstrating that dynamin-dependent
endocytosis was a critical determinant of Notch3 activation.
To determine whether inhibiting dynamin-mediated endocytosis via dynasore could affect apoptosis, NICD3-positive

treated with dynasore, likely because of the weak expression of
Jagged-1 in these cells (Fig. 5A). Induction of apoptosis by
Dynasore treatment was also noted in uterine cancer cells
(Ishikawa), which express Notch3 and Jagged-1 (Supplementary Fig. S4E and S4F). Dynasore treatment increased Jagged-1
expression in uterine cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S4E),
which may occur due to a possible feedback loop of Notch
inhibition or cross-talk with other pathways such as Wnt/
b-catenin.
Next, we searched for potential Notch3-targeted genes that
could be involved in apoptosis in OvCa cells by hierarchical
clustering analysis following Notch3 silencing. There were 461
genes differentially expressed in the OVCAR3 cells following
Notch3 silencing, when deﬁned as a fold change > 0.7 (Supplementary Table S4). Given the robust induction of apoptosis
in NICD3-positive cells, a pathway analysis focusing on apoptosis was performed. Among the 56 genes in this pathway,

www.aacrjournals.org

RPS6KB1 expression was particularly downregulated in
response to Notch3 silencing (Fig. 5B). Moreover, dynasore
treatment decreased RPS6KB1 expression by 3.0- and 1.3-fold
in OVCAR3 and A2780 cells, respectively (Fig. 5C); we found
that cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase dramatically
increased in OVCAR3 and A2780 cells, but not in SKOV3 cells,
suggesting that RPS6KB1 was a dominant downstream target
of the Notch3 pathway involved in apoptosis. Because it has
been reported that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling could be modulated by direct repression of PTEN via the Notch target gene
Hes1 or cMyc (12), we tested cMyc and HES1 in these cells
following dynasore treatment. Dynasore treatment decreased
cMyc and HES1 levels by 2-fold in the OVCAR3 and A2780 cells,
but not in the NICD3-negative cells (Fig. 5C and D).
We also validated the target modulation in vivo by examining the effects of Dynasore on expression of Jagged-1, cleaved
Notch3, HES1, and RP6SKB1 in the A2780 model. After two i.p.

treated with Dynasore (Fig. 5E).
In vivo targeting of Notch3 with siRNAs
On the basis of our in vitro ﬁndings, we next tested whether
silencing Notch3 could induce apoptosis in vivo and enhance
sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy. For in vivo testing,
the A2780 (NICD3/Jagged-1–positive) and SKOV3 (NICD3/
Jagged-1–negative) models were used. For systemic delivery
of siRNA, the well-characterized CH delivery system (8) was
used. In the A2780 model, tumors treated with Notch3 siRNACH or paclitaxel alone weighed 74.1% (P ¼ 0.0093) and 75.7%
(P ¼ 0.0081) less, respectively, than control siRNA-CH–treated

tumors (Fig. 6A). Combining Notch3 siRNA-CH and paclitaxel
reduced tumor weight by 99.3% (P ¼ 0.003, compared with
tumor weight in control mice). Mice receiving this combination treatment also had signiﬁcantly fewer tumor nodules on
average than did control siRNA-CH–treated mice (P ¼ 0.001).
In the SKOV3 model, Notch3 silencing did not affect tumor
weight or the number of tumor nodules (Fig. 6B). Treatment
with Notch3 siRNA-CH did not signiﬁcantly affect body weight
(Supplementary Fig. S5A). In the OVCAR5 (NICD3-positive)
model, tumors treated with Notch3 siRNA-CH or paclitaxel
alone weighed 49.1% (P ¼ 0.0432) and 60.7% (P ¼ 0.013) less,
respectively, than did the control siRNA-CH tumors (Fig. 6C).
Also, combining Notch3 siRNA-CH and paclitaxel decreased
tumor weights by 78.7% and 72.3%, respectively, from weights

with either treatment alone (P ¼ 0.001 and 0.003, respectively).
Body weight was not signiﬁcantly affected by treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
Notch3 levels were signiﬁcantly decreased in the Notch3
siRNA-CH-treated groups compared with the levels in the
untreated mice (P < 0.01). In the A2780 model, apoptosis was
signiﬁcantly higher in the tumors treated with Notch3 silencing
than in untreated cells (Fig. 6D–G, P < 0.01). Compared with the
controls, proliferation and angiogenesis were signiﬁcantly
decreased in the tumors treated with the combination therapy.
Similar effects were noted in the OVCAR5 model (P < 0.01;
Supplementary Fig. S5B–S5E).

Discussion
The key ﬁndings from our work are that Notch pathway
alterations are prevalent and signiﬁcantly related to poor
clinical outcome in patients with ovarian cancer. Particularly,
Notch3 alterations, including ampliﬁcation and upregulation,
were highly associated with poor survival. Targeting Notch3
inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer and induced apoptosis.
Importantly, we found that dynamin-mediated endocytosis
was required for selectively activating Jag1-mediated Notch3
signaling. Cleaved Notch3 expression was the critical determinant of response to Notch-targeted therapy. Collectively,
these data identify previously unknown mechanisms underlying Notch3 signaling and identify new, biomarker-driven
approaches for therapy.
Why Notch3 expression is preferentially upregulated in
patients with ovarian cancer is not clear. Several mechanisms may contribute to its upregulation. Notch3 upregulation was partially correlated with its ampliﬁcation; Notch3
expression may be caused by transcriptional activation or
loss of negative regulators such as SNW1, because the
ability of NICD3 to recruit coactivators and corepressors
and undergo conformational changes is different from that
of Notch1 and Notch2 (13). However, we cannot rule out a
role for SNW1 in the negative regulation of Notch3 pathway
activation in such cases (14). Unlike the proteolysis ﬁndings
with Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4, we found that Notch3
proteolysis was selectively activated in ovarian cancer cells.
We considered potential explanations for selective cleaved
Notch3 expression in ovarian cancer cells, such as differential expression of the gamma-secretase complex in
NICD3-positive and NICD3-negative ovarian cancer cells,
preferential pairing of ligands and Notch3, and ligand
endocytosis for signaling activation and receptor degradation. Our data did not support an association between the
gamma-secretase complex and cleaved Notch3 expression
in NICD3-positive versus -negative ovarian cancer cells. It
has been suggested that preferential pairing of Notch3
and Jagged-1 or DLL4 can occur in colon cancer cells
(13). We found that Notch3 proteolysis was selectively
activated in ovarian cancer cells in a Jagged-1–dependent
manner, which highlights a critical role for Jagged-1 in
activating Notch3 signaling. Jagged-1 expression has
also been reported to be regulated directly by Notch 3 and
Wnt/b-catenin in ovarian cancer, which might contribute

3292

Cancer Res; 74(12) June 15, 2014

to maintaining long-term Notch3 signaling activation in
cancer cells (15).
The exact function of ligand endocytosis in intracellular
signaling is unknown. Two possible models have been
reported: one that involves ligand-induced Notch signaling
(16–18) and another that involves alternative endocytotic
adaptors such as dynamin, epsins, and actin (17). Before our
work, role of endocytotic adaptors in Jagged-1–mediated
endocytosis in activating Notch3 in ovarian cancer was
unknown. Three different dynamin genes have been identiﬁed
in mammals, including DNM1, DNM2, and DNM3. Dynamin
has been reported as an endocytotic adaptor that functions in
membrane tabulation and ﬁssion of budding vesiculo–tubular
structures and regulates ligand internalization (19). We demonstrated that selective Notch3 activation is dependent on
dynamin-mediated endocytosis and blocking dynamins with
dynamin inhibitor signiﬁcantly increased apoptosis in ovarian
cancer, which represents an innovative strategy for inhibiting
Notch3 activation.
Taken together, our ﬁndings demonstrate that Notch
pathway alterations, especially in Notch3 (ampliﬁcation or
upregulation of expression), are prevalent in HGS-OvCa
cases and shorten OS durations. Cleaved Notch3 is a key
determinant of Notch3 biology, and dynamin-mediated
endocytosis is required for Jagged-1–mediated Notch3 activation. Targeting Notch3 pathway activation with dynamin
inhibitors (20) combined with paclitaxel could be considered
for future clinical investigation.
