ABSTRACT
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a major mediator of the hypoxic response
involved in tumor progression. We had earlier described the interaction between septin
9 isoform 1 (SEPT9_i1) protein and the oxygen-regulated subunit, HIF-1α. SEPT9_i1
is a member of the conserved family of GTP-binding cytoskeleton septins. SEPT9_i1
stabilizes HIF-1α and facilitates its cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation. We utilized split
yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)
methodology to monitor the interaction between HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1 in live cells.
N-terminal (YN) and C-terminal (YC) split YFP chimeras with HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1 on
both their amino and carboxyl termini were generated. HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1 chimeras
were expressed in cancer cells and screened for functional complementation. SEPT9_
i1-YN and YC-HIF-1α formed a long-lived highly stable complex upon interaction. The
BiFC signal was increased in the presence of hypoxia-mimicking agents. In contrast,
YC-∆HLH-HIF-1α chimera, which lacked the helix-loop-helix domain that is essential
for the interaction with SEPT9_i1 as well as the expression of SEPT9_i1 252-379 amino
acids fragment required for the interaction with HIF-1α, significantly reduced the BiFC
signal. The signal was also reduced when cells were treated with 17-N-allylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor that inhibits HIF-1α. It was increased
with fourchlorfenuron, a small molecule that increases the interaction between HIF-1α
and SEPT9_i1. These results reconfirmed the interaction between HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1
that was imaged in live cells. This BiFC system represents a novel approach for
studying the real-time interaction between these two proteins and will allow highthroughput drug screening to identity compounds that disrupt this interaction.

INTRODUCTION

oxygen conditions, HIF-1α is hydroxylated at specific
proline residues (402 and 564), ubiquitinated by the tumor
suppressor protein Von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) and targeted
for proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions,
hydroxylation is inhibited, and HIF-1α rapidly accumulates
in the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus. HIF-1α
then dimerizes with HIF-1β to recruit co-activators and
drive transcription of many genes critical for key aspects
of cancer pathogenesis [6 , 8–10]. Increased levels of HIF1α have been demonstrated in the majority of primary
human cancers and their metastases [11–13], and they
were shown to be related to poor prognosis and treatment
failure [2]. Anticancer effects of HIF-1 inhibition have
been evidenced in mouse models of human cancer (see
review [2]). Considering the profound impact of HIF-1α

Hypoxia is a common finding in advanced
human tumors and it is often associated with metastatic
dissemination and poor prognosis [1]. The primary
mechanism mediating adaptive responses to hypoxia
is the regulation of transcription by hypoxia-inducible
factor (HIF) 1 and 2 [2]. Cancer-specific HIF activity,
especially in regions of intratumoral hypoxia, has been
shown to mediate angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, stem-cell maintenance, invasion, metastasis, and
resistance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy [3–5].
HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed
of a constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit and an
oxygen-regulated HIF-1α subunit [6, 7]. Under normal

on cancer progression, there has been vast growing
interest in the biology of the HIF-1α pathway and in the
development of direct or indirect HIF-1 inhibitors for
cancer therapy [14–17].
Targeting specific protein-protein interactions that
play central roles in the HIF system offer therapeutic
possibilities [18]. We previously described an activation of
HIF-1 pathway that was mediated by septin 9 isoform 1
protein (SEPT9_i1), a member of the mammalian septin
family. SEPT9_i1 is a product of septin 9 variant 1
(SEPT9_v1) mRNA, originally designated as MSF-A
[19]. This interaction increased HIF-1α protein stability
and HIF-1 transcriptional activity in vitro and promoted
proliferation, tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo
[19]. Knocking down SEPT9_i1 or disrupting HIF-1α/
SEPT9_i1 interaction gave reciprocal effects: it led to the
reduction of HIF-1 transcriptional activity and to decreased
tumor growth and angiogenesis [20, 21]. Based on our
accumulative data having indicated that this complex is
important for tumor progression, we now aimed to target
the HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1 interaction in the search for
new inhibitors in the HIF-1 pathway. We chose to use
a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)
assay that enables direct visualization of protein-protein
interactions at high spatial resolution in live cells [22].
To design this BiFC assay, the yellow fluorescent protein
(YFP) was split into two fragments (the N-terminal YN
and the C-terminal YC) that are fused to the protein of
interest (HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1). Reconstitution of the YFP
fluorophore occurs when the two fragments of the split YFP
are approximated to each other as a result of protein–protein
interactions [23]. In this study, we established an in vivo
binding assay for monitoring and imaging the intracellular
localization of HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1 interactions in live
cells. We showed specificity and validity of this assay using
different genetic and pharmacological treatments to serve
as a platform for screening new therapeutic compounds
inhibiting HIF-1α/SEPT9_i1 interaction.

than SEPT9_i1 plasmids (10:1) when co-transfected.
Before visualization, the transfected cells were treated with
CoCl2, an iron chelator that mimics hypoxia and stabilizes
HIF-1α under normoxic conditions [24]. All the different
combinations of HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1 chimeras were
tested for BiFC (data not shown). The pair combination
that gave the best complementation signal wasYC-HIF-1α
with SEPT9_i1-YN (Figure 3), and it was chosen for
further studies. In some cases we noticed some speckles
distributed mainly in the cytoplasm as in Figure 3. These
speckles most likely appeared because overexpression
of the chimeras that tend to aggregate and accumulate in
p-bodies as proposed by Förg T. et al. [25]. To confirm
that the selected chimeras are able to interact with each
other YC-HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1-YN were expressed in
PC-3 cells and processed for immunofluorescence labeling
with antibodies to HA (YC-HIF-1α) (red), and GFP-N’
(SEPT9_i1-YN) (green) as well as with DAPI (blue)
(Supplementary Figure 1). Image analysis showed 70%
colocalization (Supplementary Figure 1). We also examined
whether the two chimeras are transcriptionally active
using a reporter gene assay expressing luciferase under
hypoxia-response elements (Supplementary Figure 2).
HIF-1 transcriptional activity was significantly induced
by hypoxia and further increased in the presence of both
chimeras (Supplementary Figure 2). These results indicated
that the selected chimeras interact with each other as well
as with HIF-1β to be transcriptionally functional.

Characterization of YC-HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1YN interaction in live cells
We had previously identified the domains required
for the interaction of HIF-1α with SEPT9_i1 as being the
HLH domain of HIF-1α and amino acids 252–379 domain
within the GTPase domain of SEPT9_i1 [26]. To confirm
the specificity of the interacting chimeras, we designed
and expressed YC-HIF-1α lacking the HLH domain
(YC-DHLH-HIF-1α) with full-length SEPT9_i1-YN
(Figure 4A). After transfection, the cells were incubated
with another iron chelator dibenzoylmethane (DBM)
[27], which induced a higher fluorescence signal than
that of CoCl2 (not shown) upon complementation. The
BiFC signal was significantly lower when YC-∆HLHHIF-1α was used compared with that of wild-type YCHIF-1α (Figure 4B and 4C). To further characterize the
specificity of the BiFC signal, we used co-expression of
the domain of SEPT9_i1 (252-379aa) that is essential
for the interaction with HIF-1α together with the active
chimeras. SEPT9_i1 252-379aa fragment also reduced the
BiFC signal obtained by YC-HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1-YN
in the presence of DBM (Figure 4D). These results
showed the specificity of the BiFC signal obtained from
this system and re-confirmed our previous observations of
the interacting sites of the two proteins.

RESULTS
Generation of HIF-1α/SEPT9_i1 split-YFP
system
We used YFP-based BiFC methodology in order
to study the interaction between HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1
in live cancer cells. Split-YFP chimeras with either YN
or YC on the N-terminal or C-terminal of each of the
proteins were constructed as illustrated in Figure 1A. A
yellow fluorescence signal is obtained after the interaction
takes place (Figure 1B). The expression of HIF-1α‘s
(Figure 2A) and SEPT9_i1’s (Figure 2B) chimeras was
confirmed using Western blot analysis. Because HIF-1α’s
chimeras are susceptible to continuous degradation under
normoxic conditions, more HIF-1α plasmids were used

HIF-1α stability [28, 29], or with forchlorofenuron (FCF)
that was previously shown to increase HIF-1α/SEPT9_i1

17-AAG decreased the BiFC signal, while FCF
significantly increased the BiFC signal. All signals were

were selected for YC-HIF-1α induction (Figure 6B).
The BiFC signal of these stable cells was higher but only
after DBM treatment (Figure 6C and 6D). Therefore,
we next constructed HIF-1α mutated in its two proline
hydroxylation sites (proline residues 402 and 564 within the
oxygen-dependent degradation domain [ODDD]) termed
double proline mutated (DPM) into the YC vector to create
a YC-HIF-1α-DPM chimera (Figure 7A). This chimera was

indeed stable under normoxic conditions independent of
DBM and with a higher basal BiFC signal (Figure 7B).
Moreover, image analysis showed that the BiFC signal was
mainly nuclear and ~11-fold higher than the BiFC signal
when YC-∆HLH-HIF-1α was used (Figure 7C). We believe
the use of the YC-HIF-1α/SEPT9_i1 BiFC system reflected
real-time protein-protein interaction which can serve as a
platform for further studies in the future.

In the present study, we generated a novel BiFC
system that imaged real-time interaction between HIF-1α
and SEPT9_i1 proteins in live cancer cells (Figures 1–3).
The system proved to be sensitive to pharmacological
treatments that influenced the levels of HIF-1α protein or
disrupted its interaction with SEPT9_i1 protein (Figure 5).

This unique assay reconfirmed our previous finding of
identifying the HLH part of HIF-1α and the GTPase part
of SEPT9_i1 as the interacting domains required for the
protein-protein interaction (Figure 4).
The overexpression of both HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1
has been correlated with tumor progression in numerous
cancers. SEPT9 has been found to be overexpressed in
diverse human tumors, including breast, head and neck,
ovarian, endometrial, kidney, and pancreatic cancer
[31–33], and its overexpression was recently shown to
correlate with high-grade breast cancer [34] and prostate
cancer [35]. HIF-1α up-regulation under normoxic
conditions has been noted with increasing frequency in
many cancers [36]. We had earlier shown that SEPT9_i1
upregulates HIF-1α in an oxygen-independent manner
[21,  26]. Evidently, any interference of this interaction
either by a specific shRNA to SEPT9_i1 [20] or by a
SEPT9_i1 N-terminal peptide, which competes with
SEPT9_i1 in the interaction with the nuclear transporter

importin-α [21], decreases HIF-1 activation, tumor
progression and angiogenesis.
Furthermore, when utilizing another mode of
HIF-1α/SEPT9_i1 complex disruption such as reducing
the dissociation of SEPT9_i1 filaments from the complex
by FCF leads to the inhibition of the HIF-1 pathway and
suppression of tumorigenic properties of prostate cancer
cells [30, 37]. Therefore, we believe that disruption of
the HIF-1α/SEPT9_i1 complex is beneficial for cancer
therapy, and that the BiFC system is vitally important for
evaluating novel compounds capable of disrupting the
protein-protein interaction.
Using the double proline-mutated and nondegradable
species of HIF-1α (Figure 7) adds an advantage to this
system, especially in the search for molecules to disrupt
the interaction per se rather than molecules that accelerate
the degradation of HIF-1α. Secondly, this HIF-1α species
is prevented from degradation under normal oxygen levels
that are optimal for tumor cell growth. The BiFC system is

highly sensitive and can be used in the future to portray the
interaction in living animals. Compared with fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) methodology, BiFC has
a more stable signal and can be used in vivo [38].
Limitations of this system include anticipated
difficulties to pass the cells after multistep transfections

in large quantities until screening. In addition, fluorescent
signals are very sensitive to minimal changes which may
be caused by compounds with insignificant effects on
HIF-1α/SEPT9_i1 interactions. It should also be taken into
account that HIF-1α/SEPT9_i1 complex (BiFC signal)
could be influenced by other cellular functions, such as

the androgen-androgen receptor pathway, which does not
exist in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. It is still encouraging
to document changes after manipulating the interaction
by using small molecule compounds, such as the HSP90
inhibitor 17-AAG, FCF, and DBM. This may reflect the
reliability of the system.
In this study, we have established a novel BiFC
system for studying and visualizing the interaction between
the HIF-1α protein and the SEPT9_i1 protein. This assay
represents a novel approach for studying and further
investigating the real-time interaction between these two
proteins in live cells. In addition, this system will allow
high-throughput drug screening to identity compounds that
disrupt the interaction between HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1. The
distinct advantage of this system is that it will also allow
target validation of identified compounds in the future.

and mouse monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (Covance,
Berkley, CA). Horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary
antibodies were used for Western blotting (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Dibenzoylmethane
(DBM), 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), forchlorfenuron (FCF) and doxycycline (Dox) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Plasmids construction
The human Flag-tagged HIF-1α, ΔHLH-HIF-1α
(HIF-1α truncated at the HLH domain), HIF-1α-DPM
(double proline mutation; HIF-1α mutated in prolines
residues 402 and 564) and SEPT9_v1 used in this study
have been described elsewhere [19, 26]. The split yellow
fluorescent protein (YFP) constructs YN-EE, YC-HA,
EE-YN and HA-YC [39] were a gift from S. Yalovsky
and N. Ohad (Tel Aviv University, Israel) [40, 41]. YN-EE
and EE-YN constructs contain a cDNA encoding for the
N-terminal fragment of YFP (YN; residues 1–154 of YFP)
fused to a 5-amino-acid linker (RSIAT), which, in turn,
is fused to a 9-amino-acid EE tag. YC-HA and HA-YC
constructs contain a cDNA encoding for the C-terminal
fragment of YFP (YC; residues 155–238 of YFP) fused
to a 17-amino-acid linker (RPACKIPNDLKQKVMNH),
which, in turn, is fused to a 9-amino acid HA tag. YNEE and YC-HA were cloned into pCDNA3.1(+) vector
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), while EE-YN and HA-YC
were cloned into pcDNA4A/Myc-His (Invitrogen) using
PCR with the indicated primers and restriction enzymes
(Table 1). Flag-tagged HIF-1α, ΔHLH-HIF-1α, HIF-1αDPM and SEPT9_i1 [26] were re-cloned into these vectors
and verified by sequencing (Table 1). Tet-On-induced
HIF-1α was constructed by re-cloning YC-HIF-1α into a
pcDNA5/TO vector (Invitrogen) (Table 1).

the cells were transfected with SEPT9_i1-YN plasmid

Cells were transiently transfected using Fugene

and the stable clones were selected and cultured in
medium containing 100 µg/ml Zeocin (Bio Basic Canada,
Canada), after which SEPT9_i1-YN expression in single
clones was analyzed by Western blotting. Then, a selected
clone stably expressing SEPT9_i1-YN was transfected
with pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen), and single clones were
selected and cultured in medium containing both 20 µg/ml
blasticidin S (Invivogen) and 100 µg/ml Zeocin. Selected
clones were transiently transfected with pcDNA5/TOYC-HIF-1α. In order to select a single clone expressing
the tet-repressor, the cells were untreated or treated with
1 µg/ml doxicycline for 72 hours and analyzed by Western
blotting. Finally, selected clones expressing both SEPT9_
i1-YN and tet-repressor were transfected with pcDNA5/
TO-YC-HIF-1α. Stable clones were selected in media
containing 250 µg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen), 20 μg/mL
blasticidin S and 100 µg/ml Zeocin. Inducible expression
of YC- HIF-1α was confirmed by Western blotting.

define the nuclear region of interest (ROI). Quantitative
fluorescence data were exported from ImageJ-generated
histograms into Microsoft Excel software for further
analysis and presentation. Mean nuclear staining of all cells
quantified from 4 different fields and under the different
conditions was calculated and compared. The data are
expressed as average of the means ± SD. When the number
of speckles in the cytoplasm was high as in Figures  3
and 7, the quantitative analysis included only nuclear
complementation signals based on DAPI staining. Student’s
t test was used to compare differences between the selected
conditions. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

GRANT SUPPORT

Protein extraction and Western blotting

This project was funded by the Dr. Miriam and
Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Research Foundation
(AMRF).

HEK293 or PC-3 cells were analyzed as previously
described [42]. Protein concentrations were determined
using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL), and 50–70 µg protein were subjected
to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. YN
fragments were detected using anti-GFP-N’ antibody,
and YC fragments were detected using anti-HA antibody,
respectively. The signal was detected using an enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Clarity, Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Richmond, CA) and digitally captured by MicroChemi
(DNR Bio-imaging Systems, Jerusalem, Israel).

Live cell fluorescence confocal microscopy
PC-3 cells were cultured on 35-mm glass-bottom
plates and transiently transfected with the indicated
plasmids. Forty-eight hours following transfection, the cells
were imaged by a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope
for BiFC yellow fluorescence signal and for Hoechst
nuclear staining. Laser and microscope settings were set
to obtain optimal signals, following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Identical parameters (e.g., scanning line, laser
light, contrast, and brightness) were used for comparing
fluorescence intensities of the different conditions. From
4–6 microscopic fields were taken from each sample, and
a representative field is shown in Figures. Western blotting
analysis was performed to confirm the expression of
each chimera or other proteins by. The expression of the
chimeras and SEPT9252–380 was verified by immunoblottig
using the respective antibodies; for SEPT9252–380 antibody
to myc was used according to its c-terminal tag.
