Abstract
To test the ability of nanoparticle formulations to overcome
P-glycoprotein (P-gp)–mediated multidrug resistance, several different doxorubicin and paclitaxel-loaded lipid nanoparticles were prepared. Doxorubicin nanoparticles showed
6- to 8-fold lower IC50 values in P-gp–overexpressing human
cancer cells than those of free doxorubicin. The IC50 value
of paclitaxel nanoparticles was over 9-fold lower than that
of Taxol in P-gp–overexpressing cells. A series of in vitro cell
assays were used including quantitative studies on uptake
and efflux, inhibition of calcein acetoxymethylester efflux,
alteration of ATP levels, membrane integrity, mitochondrial
membrane potential, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity. Enhanced uptake and prolonged retention of doxorubicin were observed
with nanoparticle-based formulations in P-gp–overexpressing
cells. Calcein acetoxymethylester and ATP assays confirmed
that blank nanoparticles inhibited P-gp and transiently
depleted ATP. I.v. injection of pegylated paclitaxel nanoparticles showed marked anticancer efficacy in nude mice
bearing resistant NCI/ADR-RES tumors versus all control
groups. Nanoparticles may be used to target both drug and
biological mechanisms to overcome multidrug resistance via
P-gp inhibition and ATP depletion. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):3918–26]

Introduction
Drug resistance is the major cause of failure of cancer
chemotherapy. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a term used to
describe the broad-spectrum resistance to chemotherapy in human
cancer, which is a complex phenomenon that can result from
several biochemical mechanisms that are still not fully understood
(1). A widely studied mechanism of MDR is that resulting from
altered cell membrane transport. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by
the mdr1 gene is well-characterized and known to be a clinically
important transporter protein belonging to the ATP-binding
cassette family of membrane transporters (2). It has been shown
to pump substrates, including doxorubicin and paclitaxel, out of
tumor cells through an ATP-dependent mechanism that reduces
the effective drug concentrations and consequently decreases the
cytotoxic activity. A large number of P-gp inhibitors have been

developed. However, clinical trials have been disappointing due to
the high inherent toxicities of P-gp inhibitors and/or changed
pharmacokinetics and biodistribution properties of anticancer
drugs coadministrated with P-gp inhibitors (3).
Formulation strategies have been developed to potentially
address P-gp–mediated resistance including colloidal delivery
systems, polymer-drug conjugates, and polymeric-micelles. Certain
drug-loaded liposomes (4, 5) and solid lipid nanoparticles (6, 7)
have been shown to decrease the resistance of P-gp–expressing
cells in vitro, which has been attributed to increased cellular
accumulation of the drug. However, importantly, intracellular drug
was still removed by P-gp efflux because formulations did not
affect P-gp function (8, 9). Anticancer drugs conjugated to
polymers such as N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide have been
shown to effectively kill both sensitive and resistant cancer cells.
Proposed mechanisms for these conjugates in resistant cells
include internalization by endocytosis, partial inhibition of P-gp
gene expression (10), and modification of caspase-dependent
apoptosis signaling pathways (11). Polymeric-micelles based on
Pluronic, coblock polymers composed of poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene) have been used to modulate P-gp in cancer
cells (12, 13). Pluronic micelles have been used to selectively inhibit
the P-gp efflux system by ATP depletion in P-gp cells, as well as to
reduce the glutathione/glutathione S-transferase detoxification
system and to alter apoptotic signal transduction.
Our laboratory has previously developed paclitaxel nanoparticles
wherein the drug was entrapped into nanoparticles having
emulsifying wax as the oil phase and polyoxyethylene 20-stearyl
ether (Brij 78) as the surfactant. These paclitaxel nanoparticles
were used to overcome P-gp–mediated resistance in vitro in a
human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (HCT-15; ref. 14) and in vivo
in a nude mouse HCT-15 xenograft model (15). The purpose of the
present article was to determine how improved paclitaxel nanoparticles and new doxorubicin nanoparticles overcome P-gp–
mediated resistance.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines and cell culture. The P-gp–overexpressing human
ovarian carcinoma cell line NCI/ADR-RES and sensitive cell line OVCAR8 were both obtained from National Cancer Institute. The P-gp–overexpressing human melanoma cell line MDA-MB-435/LCC6MDR1 and
matching sensitive cell line were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Clarke
(Georgetown University, Washington, DC).
Preparation and characterization of doxorubicin and paclitaxel
nanoparticles. Drug-loaded nanoparticles were prepared directly from
warm o/w microemulsion precursors. Doxorubicin nanoparticles were
prepared and characterized as previously described (16). Doxorubicin

Nanoparticles Inhibit P-gp and Deplete ATP
release studies (n = 3) were completed at 37jC using the dialysis method.
Doxorubicin nanoparticles (200 AL) in a cellulose ester dialysis membrane
(MWCO: 100,000) were submerged in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37jC. Released
doxorubicin was measured by fluorescence detection at 480 nm excitation
and 550 nm emission. Paclitaxel nanoparticles were also prepared and
characterized as previously described (17). To prepare pegylated paclitaxel
BTM nanoparticles, Brij 700 (8% w/w ratio of Brij 700 to Miglyol 812) was
added before cooling the microemulsion.
In vitro cytotoxicity studies. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at
1.5  104 cells per well and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were
incubated for 48 h with drug equivalent concentrations of all test articles
ranging from 10,000 nmol/L to 0.01 nmol/L of free drug (corresponding
to 5.45 Ag/mL–5.45 pg/mL for doxorubicin, and 8.54 Ag/mL–8.54 pg/mL
for paclitaxel). The sulforhodamine B assay was performed and
IC50 values were calculated based on the percentage of treatment over
control (18).
Cellular uptake and efflux of doxorubicin in cells. Cells were seeded
in 48-well plates at a density of 2  105 cells per well and incubated
overnight. Confluent cell monolayers were washed with Earle’s balanced salt
solution (EBSS) and treated with test articles. All samples were diluted with
EBSS buffer and adjusted to 5 Ag doxorubicin per milliliter or the
doxorubicin equivalent concentration. Cells were treated with samples at
37jC for 0.5, 1, and 2 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4)
and lysed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 at 37jC for 30 min. For
efflux studies, cells were treated with each sample for 2 h, washed, and then
cells were incubated with EBSS buffer at 37jC for another 1, 2, and 4 h.
Doxorubicin concentrations in cell lysates were measured by HPLC on
an Inertsil ODS-3 column with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1 mol/L
ammonium formate containing 0.14% triethylamine [adjusted pH to 2.4 by
addition of formic acid-acetonitrile-methanol-tetrahydrofuran (60:25:
17.5:2.5, v/v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and doxorubicin was

detected by fluorescence with 480/550 nm excitation/emission. doxorubicin
concentrations were normalized for protein content as measured with the
BCA assay (Pierce; ref. 19)]. The cell efflux rate was calculated as (uptake at
2 h  efflux at 4 h)/4.
Calcein acetoxymethylester assay for P-gp function. A calcein
acetoxymethylester (calcein AM) assay was performed using a modified
method (20). Briefly, cells were seeded in black 96-well plates at a density of
1  105 cells per well overnight and treated with 50 AL of various doses of
test articles diluted in EBSS buffer. After 0.5 h at 37jC, 50 AL of 0.25 Amol/L
calcein AM (Sigma-Aldrich) were added into each well and the fluorescence
of calcein was immediately measured every 5 min for 1 h using a microplate
reader with 485/589 excitation/emission at room temperature. For
pretreatment experiments, cells were exposed to blank NPs #2 for
0.5 h and washed, and then 50 AL of fresh EBSS buffer was added before
addition of calcein AM. The % relative fluorescence (FL) in the cells was
expressed as: % FL = [(FLtreatment  FLnontreatment)/FLnontreatment]  100%.
To assess cell membrane integrity, cells were treated with the same
samples for 0.5 h at 37jC, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
Then, cells were trypsinized and 50 AL of 0.4% trypan blue solution was
added. Membrane integrity was normalized to untreated control and
expressed as (viable cells/total cells)  100%.
ATP and apoptosis assays. An ATP assay was performed as described
previously (21). Cells were seeded in 48-well plates at a density of 2  105
cells per well and incubated overnight. Various doses of test articles in
EBSS buffer were added to cells and incubated at 37jC for 2 h. After
treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with PBS
containing 1% Triton X-100 at 37jC for 30 min. ATP in cell lysates was
then measured using ATPlite 1step Assay kit (PerkinElmer) and
normalized for protein content. Cell apoptosis under the tested conditions
above was measured using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit I
(BD Biosciences).

of nanoparticles and excipients are calculated from the composition shown in Table 1.

To assess whether cells could recover from ATP depletion, cells were
incubated with various concentrations of test articles for 2 h, washed, and
then incubated for another 4 and 13 h, and then ATP levels and total
proteins were measured.
Histology studies by TEM. Cells were washed, scraped, and fixed in 4%
buffered formalin, postfixed in 2% osmium tetraoxide, and dehydrated in
ascending concentrations of ethanol before embedded in Araldite 502.
Blocks were sectioned at 1 Am and 800 Å for light and electron microscopy.
Thin sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate before
examined using a Philips 10 electron microscope operated at 60 kV.
Mitochondrial potential measurement. Cells were seeded in black 96well plates at a density of 1  105 cells per well overnight and treated with
test articles for 2 h at 37jC. After washing, mitochondrial potential was
detected using the JC-1 Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Detection kit
(Biotium). Paclitaxel BTM nanoparticles (1.5 or 0.15 Ag/mL) and 6 Ag/mL of
cyclosporin A were used as positive and negative controls. Mitochondrial
potential was expressed as (red FL/green FL) treatment/(red FL/green FL)

96-well plates as a density of 4  104 overnight and incubated with 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and samples
for 2 h at 37jC. Two hundred microliters of reagent containing 20% SDS, and
50% dimethyl formamide in water was added and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature, and plates were read at 570 nm (test) and 650 nm (reference).

In vivo anticancer efficacy study using pegylated paclitaxel BTM
nanoparticles. Female nude (nu/nu) mice, 4 to 5 wk (Harlan Laboratories),
were housed in a pathogen-free room. All experiments involving the mice
were carried with an approved protocol by the University of North Carolina
Animal Care and Use Committee. The mice were injected s.c. in the
interscapular region with 4  106 NCI/ADR-RES cells suspended in DMEM.
When the tumors exhibited volume between 50 and 150 mm3, the mice
were randomly assigned to different treatments at 2 different paclitaxel
doses of 4.5 and 2.25 mg/kg. Mice were injected with either 100 or 200 AL of
isotonic treatment article by i.v. injection. Tumors were measured in 2
perpendicular dimensions every 2 d for 12 d, and the tumor volume was
calculated using the formula V = (L  W 2) / 2, where L and W are the
longest and shortest diameters, respectively.
Statistical analysis. Statistical comparisons were made with ANOVA
followed by pair-wise comparisons using Student’s t test using GraphPad
Prism software. Results were considered significant at 95% confidence
interval (P < 0.05).

doxorubicin at a mole ratio of 1:1.2 (doxorubicin/STS) and resulted
in an ion-pair complex that had both low solubility in PBS and high
solubility in the melted oil phases. All nanoparticles were stable
over 1 month at 4jC (data not shown).
In vitro cytotoxicity studies. Cytotoxicity data in two pairs of
parental (sensitive) and P-gp cell lines are reported in Fig. 1. As
expected, in the tested doxorubicin concentration range, free
doxorubicin showed no toxicity in NCI/ADR-RES cell line in the
tested concentration range (IC50, >5.45 Ag/mL, corresponding to
>10,000 nmol/L) and very low toxicity in MDA-MB-435/LCC6MDR1
cell line (IC50, 3.62 Ag/mL, corresponding to 6,643 nmol/L; Fig. 1A
and B). Doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles showed a clear dosedependent cytotoxicity against all tested cell lines. In sensitive cell
lines, the IC50 values of doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles were
comparable with those of free doxorubicin. In comparison, the IC50
values of doxorubicin NPs #2 were 8-fold lower in NCI/ADR-RES
cells (IC50, <0.61 Ag/mL, corresponding to 1,111 nmol/L) and in
MDA-MB-435/LCC6MDR1 cells (IC50, <0.45 Ag/mL, corresponding
to 821 nmol/L) than those of free doxorubicin. Blank nanoparticles
did not cause significant cytotoxicity against all cell lines up to a
total nanoparticle dose of 30 Ag/mL.
Interestingly, the postaddition of doxorubicin to blank nanoparticles showed similar cytotoxicity to doxorubicin nanoparticles
in both sensitive and resistant cell lines. Thus, to ascertain if this
phenomenon was drug specific, paclitaxel G78 nanoparticles and
paclitaxel BTM nanoparticles were tested for cytotoxicity in
OVCAR-8 and NCI/ADR-RES cells and compared with Taxol. As
shown in Fig. 1C and D, the IC50 value of Taxol in NCI/ADRRES cells was 495-fold greater (IC50, 3.26 Ag/mL, corresponding
to 3,814 nmol/L) than that in sensitive cells (IC50, 0.00658 Ag/mL,
corresponding to 7.7 nmol/L). Also, the IC50 value of both paclitaxel
nanoparticles was over 9-fold lower than that of Taxol in P-gp
cells. Both blank nanoparticles did not show significant cytotoxicity in these cell lines. Similar to when free doxorubicin was postadded to blank nanoparticles, the postaddition of free paclitaxel to
blank G78 nanoparticles or blank BTM nanoparticles had comparable cytotoxicity to that of paclitaxel entrapped in nanoparticles.
The IC50 values of the postaddition were slightly lower than those
of paclitaxel nanoparticles in both cell lines; however, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) only in the sensitive cells.
Cellular uptake and efflux of doxorubicin. The uptake and
efflux of doxorubicin with various formulations containing 5 Ag/mL
of doxorubicin was examined in both NCI/ADR-RES and MDAMB-468 cells at different temperatures (Fig. 2). Doxorubicin NPs #2
were chosen as the basic nanoparticle formulation for these
studies. The uptake of doxorubicin was time dependent except
when cells were pretreated with blank NPs #2. In NCI/ADR-RES cell
line at 37jC, nanoparticles led to over a 2-fold increase in the
extent of uptake compared with treatment with free doxorubicin
(Fig. 2A). Similarly, all treatments with nanoparticle formulations
enhanced the retention of doxorubicin. After cells were treated
with doxorubicin NPs #2, >15-fold doxorubicin remained in the
P-gp cells and the efflux rate was 1.5-fold lower compared with free
doxorubicin after 4 hours of efflux. Importantly, the postaddition of
doxorubicin to blank NPs #2 also showed enhanced uptake and
retention. To eliminate the possibility that doxorubicin was quickly
bound to the surface of blank NPs #2, cells were pretreated with
blank NPs #2 and washed before the addition of free doxorubicin.
In this treatment, the uptake of doxorubicin was very rapid and
reached a maximum within 0.5 hour, and 7-fold greater
doxorubicin was retained in cells compared with free doxorubicin.

Figure 3. Dose response of blank NPs #2 and surfactants in calcein AM assay in NCI/ADR-RES cells (A), MDA-MB-435/LCC6MDR1 cells (B ), OVCAR-8 cells (C ),
and MDA-MB-435/LCC6 cells (D ). Concentrations are presented as concentrations of blank NPs #2 (sum of mass of oils and surfactants) and as concentrations
of free Brij 78 and TPGS. Points, mean (n = 3); bars, SD.

However, the efflux rate of this treatment [0.19 (doxorubicin)(ng)/
(protein)(Ag)/h] was significantly greater than that of free
doxorubicin [0.13 (doxorubicin)(ng) / (protein)(Ag)/h; P < 0.05;
Fig. 2A]. The uptake of doxorubicin in NCI/ADR-RES cells at 4jC
with doxorubicin NPs #2 and free doxorubicin was 24-fold lower
and 10-fold lower, respectively, than those at 37jC. Unlike the
uptake at 37jC that showed marked differences between nanoparticle groups and free doxorubicin, the differences at 4jC were
significantly reduced (data not shown). The extent of doxorubicin
uptake was also carried out in sensitive MDA-MB-468 cells at 37jC.
Nanoparticle formulations showed greater uptake than free
doxorubicin as shown in Fig. 2B. In fact, the doxorubicin NPs #2
very rapidly entered MDA-MB-468 cells and doxorubicin from
nanoparticles quickly and extensively localized inside the nuclei of
cells by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown).
To confirm that Brij 78 could also enhance doxorubicin uptake
and decrease efflux, NCI/ADR-RES cells were pretreated with
various concentrations of Brij 78 (Fig. 2C). At the concentrations of
Brij 78 that showed ATP depletion, pretreatment of cells with Brij
78 led to comparable doxorubicin uptake enhancement and efflux
reduction compared with blank NPs #2 (Fig. 2A).
Calcein AM assay. The ability of blank NPs #2, and the Brij 78
and d-a-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS)
surfactants to inhibit P-gp was evaluated using the calcein AM
assay in five resistant and sensitive cell lines (Fig. 3). Under all

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

conditions tested, the trypan blue assay confirmed that there was
no significant loss of cell membrane integrity (data not shown). In
resistant cells, the fluorescence caused by intracellular calcein
significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner either in the
presence of blank BTM nanoparticles (data not shown), blank NPs
#2 (Fig. 3A and B), or when cells were pretreated with blank NPs #2
for 0.5 hour (data not shown). Brij 78 and TPGS surfactants also led
to a dose-dependent increase in calcein fluorescence over 1 hour.
In contrast, polystyrene nanoparticles did not increase intracellular
fluorescence. In stark contrast, no treatments led to increased
intracellular fluorescence compared with calcein AM alone in the
sensitive MDA-MB-468 cells (data not shown), OVCAR-8 cells
(Fig. 3C), and MDA-MB-435/LCC6 cells (Fig. 3D). However, the
human melanoma MDA-MB-435/LCC6 cells showed greater
permeability as the uptake of calcein AM was higher in these cells.
ATP and apoptosis assays. To further understand the
mechanisms by which blank nanoparticles and surfactants
inhibited P-gp, intracellular ATP levels in cells were measured
after exposure to various concentrations of blank NPs #2, Brij 78,
and TPGS. In resistant NCI/ADR-RES and MDA-MB-435/
LCC6MDR1 cells, ATP levels decreased in a dose-dependent
manner after treatment with blank BTM nanoparticles, blank
NPs #2, and Brij 78% to 40%, 35%, and 20% of the initial value,
respectively; however, there was no change in ATP levels after
treatment with TPGS (Fig. 4A). Importantly, cyclosporin A and

polystyrene nanoparticles did not decrease ATP levels in the tested
concentration range in NCI/ADR-RES cells. In contrast, over all
tested concentrations in sensitive MDA-MB-468 and OVCAR-8 cells,
only 0.5 and 1 Ag/mL of Brij 78 and blank NPs #2 (doxorubicin
equivalent doses) decreased ATP levels to 86% and 65% of the
initial value, respectively (data not shown). However, ATP levels
decreased in MDA-MB-435/LCC6 cells, which had no significant
difference with those in corresponding resistant cells (data not
shown). Also, TPGS decreased ATP levels in this sensitive cell line
(data not shown). In the presence of 17 Ag/mL of cyclosporin A,
ATP levels further decreased by an additional 20% to 40% at each
concentration tested (data not shown). Finally, ATP recovery
studies showed that after blank NPs #2 and Brij 78 were removed
from NCI/ADR-RES cells, cellular ATP levels returned to 100% after

4 hours for the lower concentrations tested and were completely
restored after 13 hours for all concentrations (Fig. 4B).
Under the conditions analogous to the ATP depletion experiments, 4 concentrations of doxorubicin-equivalent doses (0.5, 1, 2,
and 5 Ag/mL) for the Brij 78 and TPGS surfactants and blank
nanoparticles were tested for their ability to induce apoptosis
versus control cells at 2 hours in NCI/ADR-RES cells. Only blank
nanoparticles at 5 Ag/mL showed significance versus control (P <
0.05), and these differences were modest (8% versus 6.7% for
control).

NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR-8 cells, doxorubicin NPs #2 or blank
NPs #2 treatment induced the most severe changes that included
cytoplasmic accumulation of multivesicular bodies, chromatin
condensation, and varying degree of mitochondrial swelling. After
1 hour of incubation, swollen mitochondria were frequently
observed in the resistant cells treated with doxorubicin NPs #2
or blank NPs #2 (Fig. 4C). However, this effect was not observed
in the sensitive MDA-MB-468 cells. In comparison, Brij 78 also
produced mitochondrial swelling in NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR8 cells (data not shown). In human melanoma cells, MDA-MB-435/
LCC6 and MDA-MB-435/LCC6MDR1, swollen mitochondria were
also observed with the treatment of blank NPs #2 or Brij 78 (data
not shown).
Mitochondrial potential measurement. Mitochondrial potential changed in all tested cells treated with blank NPs #2 and Brij 78
at the same concentrations that depleted ATP (Fig. 4D). TPGS
did not change mitochondrial potential in all cell lines except in
MDA-MDB-435/LCC6. All tested samples changed mitochondrial
potential in MDA-MB-435/LCC6 cells except the treatment with
0.15 Ag/mL of paclitaxel BTM nanoparticles.
MTT assay. To a certain extent, all tested samples including
blank NPs #2, Brij 78, and TPGS decreased MTT reduction in a
dose-dependent manner, except at the lowest concentration of
tested samples (0.05 Ag/mL of doxorubicin equivalent dose) (data
not shown). The minimum value of MTT reduction at 1 Ag/mL of
doxorubicin equivalent dose was 71% F 8% (versus control) and
observed in MDA-MB-435/LCC6 cells treated with blank NPs #2
(30 Ag/mL).
In vivo anticancer efficacy study. Tumor volume increased
with control, Taxol, and blank BTM NPs administration at the two
paclitaxel or paclitaxel-equivalent doses tested. In comparison, a
marked anticancer effect of the pegylated paclitaxel BTM nanoparticles was clearly observed (Fig. 5). The tumor volume in the
two tested pegylated paclitaxel BTM nanoparticles groups almost
did not change during the course of the study. A statistically
significant difference of pegylated paclitaxel BTM nanoparticles
from all other treatments was observed from day 5 and continued
to the end of the study. Blank BTM nanoparticles did not show any
clinical signs of toxicity even at the highest dose of 210-mg
nanoparticles/kg.

Discussion
The objective of the present studies was to investigate the
potential of drug-loaded lipid nanoparticles to overcome P-gp–
mediated drug resistance, and to elucidate possible mechanisms.
The results of the cytotoxicity studies indicate that all tested drugloaded nanoparticles significantly reduced IC50 values in P-gp–
overexpressing ovarian and melanoma cell lines over free drug. Of
interest was that the postaddition of free doxorubicin to blank
nanoparticles also showed similar IC50 values compared with
doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles (Fig. 1). This is a similar
observation as reported by Némati and colleagues (22) in which
doxorubicin-loaded polyalkylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles were
used to treat sensitive and resistant leucemic murine cells. This
observation could be the result of two possibilities: (a) due to
strong adhesive properties, doxorubicin is adsorbed onto the
surface of nanoparticles (23), and (b) blank nanoparticles could
affect P-gp and therefore enhance the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin.
To test these two possibilities, paclitaxel was used because the
neutral paclitaxel would be less likely to adhere to the slightly

(18–19 g) received 4  106 cells by s.c. injection. Mice (n = 4 per group) were

negatively charged nanoparticles. In a similar manner as doxorubicin nanoparticles, free paclitaxel postadded to blank nanoparticles showed comparable cytotoxicity as paclitaxel-loaded
nanoparticles. Temperature-dependent uptake of doxorubicin NPs
#2 in NCI/ADR-RES cells indicates an endocytosis pathway of
nanoparticles uptake. Obviously, nanoparticles not only enhanced
the uptake of doxorubicin but also improved the retention of
doxorubicin in resistant cell lines even if doxorubicin was
entrapped into nanoparticles or physically present with blank
nanoparticles. More importantly, the uptake and retention of
doxorubicin increased when cells were pretreated with blank
nanoparticles or free Brij 78 and then free doxorubicin was added
(Fig. 2A and C). These results are in contrast to a previous study
that showed that the uptake and retention of doxorubicin in MDAMB-435/LCC6MDR1 cells were not improved when free doxorubicin was added to polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (8). These
contrasting studies seem to indicate a different and preferential
mechanism of our nanoparticles from the polymer-lipid hybrid NPs
on P-gp. Taken as a whole, these studies prove that the lipid-based
nanoparticles described in the present studies inhibit the function
of P-gp. Although a prior study suggested that an ion-pair complex
of doxorubicin and polycyanoacrylic acid, a degradation product of
polyalkylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles, may increase the intracellular diffusion of doxorubicin and result in increased efficacy of
doxorubicin nanoparticles in resistant cells (24), the present study
suggested that the ion-pairing agents likely did not affect P-gp
directly because the IC50 of paclitaxel nanoparticles prepared
without ion-pair agents was also low (Fig. 1C and D). According to
the data, the factor that was the most influential was the inclusion
of the surfactant Brij 78 but not necessarily TPGS. In fact, it has
been shown that some surfactants reverse the activity of P-gp and
MRP2 (25). In these studies, we showed that both Brij 78 and TPGS
were able to increase calcein AM influx in P-g cells, but only Brij 78
was found to deplete ATP. Calcein AM is a nonfluorescent
substrate of P-gp that, once in the cells, is irreversibly converted
by cytosolic esterase to calcein, a nonpermeable and fluorescent

molecule. Thus, the increased intracellular fluorescence of calcein
when P-gp cells were exposed to lipid-based nanoparticles
indicates the inhibition of P-gp function. Moreover, the integrity
of membrane confirmed that the inhibition resulted from a
selective interaction with P-gp rather than an unspecific membrane
alteration, which may increase doxorubicin transport in resistant
cells. Additionally, the inhibition of P-gp by blank nanoparticles
was not related to nanoparticle size because polystyrene nanoparticles having the same particle size had no effect on the
intracellular fluorescence (Fig. 3A). Because P-gp efflux is an
energy-dependent process, intracellular ATP levels were investigated. The results of the present studies show that exposure to
blank NPs #2 induces a significant decrease in ATP levels in two
resistant cells without inducing cell apoptosis. The effect of
individual surfactant on ATP levels also was examined. It is clear
that Brij 78, not TPGS, decreased ATP levels in resistant cell lines
(Fig. 4A). Even at a very low actual concentration of 4.5 Ag/mL,
which is well below the critical micelle concentration of Brij 78
(860 Ag/mL), Brij 78 reduced the ATP levels after 2 hours to 78%
of the initial value. The ATP levels in sensitive cells responded
differently to different cells. ATP levels only slightly changed in
MDA-MB-468 and OVCAR-8 cells, whereas ATP levels in MDAMB-435/LCC6 cells decreased to the same extent as with the
corresponding resistant cells after treatment with either blank NPs
#2 or Brij 78. Our findings on ATP depletion are in agreement with
the previous reports from the Kabanov group that concluded that
ATP depletion caused by Pluronic P85 block copolymer was one
of the major reasons for reversal P-gp activity and dominant in
P-gp cells (20, 26). Moreover, Brij 78 had similar influence on
enhanced doxorubicin uptake and retention compared with blank
NPs #2 (Fig. 2C). The results of the present study also suggested
that reversal of P-gp function by ATP depletion caused by nanoparticles was transient and reversible, based on ATP recovery
studies (Fig. 4B) and uptake and efflux studies (Fig. 2A and C).
Our previous studies suggested that Brij 78 could influence the
activity of an alcohol dehydrogenase/NAD+ enzyme system in vitro
(27). The mitochondria are responsible for regulation of cellular
metabolism, and also are the ATP factory in cells. Increase in
matrix volume of mitochondria can be due to energetic stress
inside cells (28, 29). It is important to note that the MTT reduction
may not result from cell death because the apoptosis data and ATP
recovery data showed that cells did not undergo apoptosis and that
the ATP depletion was transient. Therefore, the MTT assay data
more likely suggested a change in the cell metabolic activity or
enzyme activity in the mitochondrial respiratory chain in treated
cells (30, 31). Therefore, it is likely that the metabolic activity was
decreased in all cells treated with blank NPs #2 and Brij 78.
Moreover, mitochondrial potential in resistant and sensitive cell
lines changed at the same concentrations of blank NPs #2 or Brij 78
that depleted ATP. However, the change in mitochondrial potential
and mitochondrial swelling did not destroy mitochondrial function
as ATP levels returned to normal within 4 to 13 hours depending
on the dose (Fig. 4B). It is worthy to note that MDA MB-435/LCC6

cells showed both changes in ATP levels and mitochondrial
potential. These effects may be related to the high permeability of
the cell membrane as observed by the relatively high uptake of
calcein AM (Fig. 3D). The change in the mitochondrial potential
was correlated with mitochondrial swelling in all tested cells in
these studies. Thus, it is possible that Brij 78 and nanoparticles
influence the enzymes involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain,
and consequently produce energy stress in cells. As a consequence,
the mitochondrial potential changes and the mitochondria swell to
meet the energy requirement. These effects are likely pronounced
in Pgp-overexpressing cells as they require more energy for P-gp
expression and function.
The current study suggested that there are at least two major
reasons for enhanced cytotoxicity of doxorubicin or paclitaxelloaded lipid-based nanoparticles in P-gp–mediated resistant cells:
(a) increased extent of drug uptake by endocytosis of nanoparticles, which helps to partially bypass P-gp; (b) decreased efflux
rate of drug through inhibition of P-gp function and ATP depletion
caused by Brij 78, a component of nanoparticles. Both increase
intracellular drug concentrations, which is the key to overcoming
transporter-mediated resistance. In vivo anticancer efficacy in mice
bearing resistant NCI/ADR-RES cell xenografts showed that
pegylated paclitaxel BTM nanoparticles significantly inhibited
tumor growth versus all tested controls. The BTM nanoparticles
also showed the ability to inhibit P-gp function and deplete ATP.
Additional in vivo studies are on-going including pharmacokinetic
and biodistribution studies, as well as additional efficacy studies in
resistant and sensitive tumor mouse tumor models.
In conclusion, both doxorubicin and paclitaxel-loaded lipidbased nanoparticles containing the Brij 78 surfactant were shown
to overcome P-gp–mediated drug resistance. The mechanism of
P-gp inhibition and ATP depletion distinguishes these Brij 78-based
nanoparticles from other known nanoparticles and liposome-based
carrier systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
on nanoparticles that can inhibit P-gp efflux and deplete ATP. Most
importantly, nanoparticle-based carriers that effectively target both
the drug and biological mechanisms to overcome MDR (P-gp
inhibition and ATP depletion) seem to be a novel therapeutic
strategy and additional in vivo work is warranted.
