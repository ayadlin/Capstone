ABSTRACT
There is a critical need for therapeutic agents that can target the amino-terminal
domain (NTD) of androgen receptor (AR) for the treatment of castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC). Calmodulin (CaM) binds to the AR NTD and regulates AR
activity. We discovered that Hydrazinobenzoylcurcumin (HBC), which binds exclusively
to CaM, inhibited AR activity. HBC abrogated AR interaction with CaM, suppressed
phosphorylation of AR Serine81, and blocked the binding of AR to androgen-response
elements. RNA-Seq analysis identified 57 androgen-regulated genes whose expression
was significantly (p ≤ 0.002) altered in HBC treated cells as compared to controls.
Oncomine analysis revealed that genes repressed by HBC are those that are usually
overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and genes stimulated by HBC are those that
are often down-regulated in PCa, suggesting a reversing effect of HBC on androgenregulated gene expression associated with PCa. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed
a role of HBC affected genes in cellular functions associated with proliferation and
survival. HBC was readily absorbed into the systemic circulation and inhibited the
growth of xenografted CRPC tumors in nude mice. These observations demonstrate
that HBC inhibits AR activity by targeting the AR NTD and suggest potential usefulness
of HBC for effective treatment of CRPC.

INTRODUCTION

recurs and progresses to become lethal [3]. This recurring
disease, referred to as castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC), continues to depend on AR signaling,
and becomes resistant to all currently available forms
of androgen-deprivation and AR-antagonistic therapies,
which are designed to target primarily the AR ligandbinding domain (LBD) [4-6]. Therefore, there is a critical
need for AR-antagonists that can inhibit AR activity
through an LBD-independent mechanism for the treatment
of CRPC [7].

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently
diagnosed non-skin cancer and second leading cause of
cancer related deaths in American men [1]. Androgen,
by activating the androgen receptor (AR), plays a pivotal
role in PCa cell proliferation and viability [2]. Hence,
androgen-deprivation is frontline therapy for the treatment
of disseminated PCa. However, this treatment does not
provide a lasting remission as the disease invariably

AR belongs to the steroid receptor family of
transcription factors containing four distinct functional
domains; amino-terminal domain (NTD) containing
activation function (AF-1), DNA binding domain (DBD),
hinge region (HR) containing nuclear localization
sequence, and carboxy-terminal LBD. The AR NTD is
crucial for AR transcriptional activity; while AR devoid
of LBD can be constitutively active, there can be no
transcriptional activity without NTD [8]. A number of
proteins interact with NTD and play an important role in
regulation of AR activity [9]. Calmodulin (CaM) is one
such co-regulator that binds to the AR NTD and regulates
AR activity; CaM-antagonists, including CaM-siRNA
inhibit AR activity and suppress AR protein stability in
PCa cells [10-12]. Thus, targeting CaM may offer a viable
strategy to inhibit AR activity through a mechanism that
does not involve intact AR LBD.
CaM is a ubiquitous calcium-binding protein that has
no intrinsic enzymatic activity but binds to and regulates
the activity of a variety of enzymes involved in cellular
processes such as cell proliferation and viability, and
cancer [13]. CaM is overexpressed in a variety of cancers
including liver, lung and breast [14-16]. Interestingly, CaM
overexpression in breast tumor tissues is associated with
increased estrogen receptor (ER) levels [17]. As in the case
of AR, CaM also binds to ER and regulates its activity [18,
19]. Recently, a novel Curcumin derivative, 4-{3,5-Bis-[2(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-4,5-dihydro-pyra­
zol-1-yl}-benzoic acid (hydrazinobenzoylcurcumin, HBC)
is developed that is shown to bind exclusively to CaM and
antagonize its function [20]. HBC inhibits proliferation of
HCT15 colon carcinoma [20] and suppresses angiogenic
activity of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells
[21]. These anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effects
of HBC are mediated by its inhibitory effect on CaMregulated signaling pathways [20, 21]. A water-soluble
form of HBC, the sodium salt of HBC, NaHBC (also
known as CTK7A), was shown to inhibit the proliferation
of KB oral squamous cell carcinoma cells and suppress the
growth of oral tumor xenografts in mice [22]. This antitumorigenic effect of HBC was shown to be associated
with its inhibitory effect on p300 histone acetyltransferase
activity, which is mediated by nitric oxide synthase [22];
importantly, nitric oxide synthase is a CaM-regulated
enzyme [23].
Since CaM regulates AR activity [10, 12], and HBC
binds exclusively to CaM [20], we investigated the effect
of HBC on AR activity and on the androgen-regulated
transcriptome in PCa cells. In addition, we evaluated the
efficacy of HBC in suppressing the growth of tumors
derived from metastatic CRPC cells in mice. We report
that HBC inhibits AR activity by disrupting AR-CaM
interaction, reverses the expression of androgen-regulated
genes associated with PCa development and progression,
and suppresses the growth of CRPC tumors in mice. These
observations suggest AR-antagonistic effect of HBC

through a mechanism that does not involve AR LBD,
and suggest potential usefulness of HBC for an effective
treatment of CRPC.

RESULTS
CaM is over-expressed in human prostate tumor
tissues
We have shown previously that CaM levels are 2- to
3- fold higher in AR-positive LNCaP cells than in ARnegative PC-3 cells [10]. We now evaluated CaM levels
in human prostate tumor tissues and found a higher level
and increased nuclear localization of CaM in prostate
tumor tissues as compared to non-tumor (benign) prostate
tissues (Fig. 1A). We tested AR and CaM expression in
serial sections of tumor tissues and found a strikingly a
greater nuclear accumulation of CaM in tumors that had a
high level of AR than in tumors with a low AR level (Fig.
1B). As shown in the Table (Fig. 1B lower panel), 3 out of
5 AR_3+ tumors had more than 75% of luminal epithelial
cells with elevated nuclear CaM. By comparison, 4 out of
5 AR_1+ tumors had less than 25% of cells with elevated
nuclear CaM. These observations raise an intriguing
possibility that overexpressed CaM in the nuclei of
prostate tumors may facilitate AR protein stability and
function.

Differential effect of HBC on proliferation of ARpositive vs. AR-negative PCa cells
Since AR plays a critical role in proliferation and
survival of PCa cells and CaM regulates AR activity [10],
we tested the effect of HBC on proliferation of prostate
cancer cells that are AR-positive and depend on AR for
proliferation (LNCaP cells). Treatment of exponentially
growing LNCaP cells with increasing concentrations
of HBC resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the
incorporation of 3H-thymidine into DNA, indicating an
anti-proliferative effect of HBC on LNCaP cells with an
IC50 of ~5 µM (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, a similar treatment
with HBC had no noticeable effect on proliferation of
AR-negative PC-3 cells even at 40 µM concentration
(Fig. 2A). In addition to LNCaP cells, HBC at 20 µM
also inhibited proliferation of androgen-independent
(castration-resistant) C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells that depend
on AR for proliferation (Fig. 2B). By comparison, HBC
had a marginal effect on proliferation of benign prostatic
epithelial BPH-1 cells that lack AR and had a negligible
effect on NIH3T3 mouse embryo fibroblast cells.
Proliferation of BPH-1 and NIH3T3 cells was sensitive
to HBC at higher concentrations ranging from 75 – 150
µM (data not shown), suggesting that the proliferation
of AR-positive androgen-sensitive (LNCaP), as well as
6137

castration-resistant (C4-2B and 22Rv1), PCa cells exhibit
a greater sensitivity to HBC than do AR-negative cells.
The inhibitory effect of HBC on LNCaP cell
proliferation was associated with a corresponding decrease
in cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclin A, cyclin
E and Cdk2, that play an important role in progression
of cells from G1 to S phase (Fig. 2C). HBC also induced
the expression of p53, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1 that negatively
regulate cell cycle progression (Fig. 2C). By comparison,
HBC had no noticeable effect on proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA), a protein associated with DNA
replication, In addition to its effect on cell cycle regulatory
proteins, at higher concentrations, HBC caused PARP1
cleavage (Fig. 2C, arrow), which is a sign of apoptosis.

Although there was no apparent cell death, as determined
by trypan blue exclusion, there was a small increase in the
rounding of cells over a 24 period (Supplementary Fig.
S1), suggesting that at concentrations exceeding 40 µM,
HBC may induce apoptotic cell death.

HBC inhibits AR transcriptional activity
Since CaM binds to AR and regulates AR protein
function and stability [10, 11], we tested the effect of
HBC on AR in LNCaP cells. HBC caused a noticeable
decrease in AR protein levels, particularly, at 30 to 40
µM concentration (Fig. 3A). Importantly, a much lower
concentration of HBC was needed to decrease the level of
prostate specific antigen (PSA), an AR-target gene, than
to decrease the AR protein level (Fig. 3A), indicating that
the decrease in PSA expression is not due to a decrease in
AR protein level and is likely due to the inhibitory effect
of HBC on AR transcriptional activity. The effect on PSA
instead associated with a 2-fold decrease in PSA mRNA
levels (Fig. 3B). The expression of another AR target gene,
NKX3.1, was decreased by 5-fold in these cells (Fig. 3B).
Notably, the inhibitory effect of HBC on the expression of
PSA and NKX3.1 was similar to that seen with Casodex
(bicalutamide) (Fig. 3B), which binds directly to the
LBD of AR and inhibits AR activity. Thus HBC inhibits
AR transcriptional activity as effectively as Casodex in
prostate cancer cells.
In an attempt to identify molecular events
contributing to HBC-induced suppression of AR activity,
we studied the effect of HBC on AR-CaM interaction.
As shown in Fig. 3C, AR-immunoprecipitate (AR-IP)
prepared from control untreated LNCaP cells contained
CaM, indicating AR interaction with CaM as described
previously [10, 11], and this interaction between AR and
CaM was blocked in cells treated with HBC. Similarly,
in a reciprocal analysis, CaM-IP prepared from control
cells contained AR, and HBC disrupted this association
(Fig. 3C), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of HBC
on AR activity may involve disruption of AR-CaM
interaction. By comparison, Casodex did not disrupt AR
interaction with CaM (Fig. 3C). Thus, HBC and Casodex
inhibit AR transcriptional activity by mechanisms that are
different from one another. In order to evaluate the effect
of HBC on the assembly of AR transcription complexes
in chromatin, we then used EMSA to test the effect of
HBC on binding of AR to PSA-ARE. As shown in Fig.
3D, the PSA-ARE oligo bound to LNCaP nuclear extract
(control) and negative controls (omitting extract or using
AR-negative DU145 nuclear extract) indicate this binding
was AR-dependent. HBC caused a 2-fold decrease in this
binding, suggesting a disruptive effect of HBC on the
assembly of AR transcription complexes. Casodex on
the other hand caused <2-fold decrease in this AR-ARE
interaction, suggesting that HBC is more effective than
Casodex in blocking AR-ARE interaction.

HBC inhibits androgen-stimulated activity of AR

expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, viz., cyclin
A, cyclin E, cyclin D1, and Cdk-2, and increased the level
of p53 and PARP cleavage in R1881-stimulated cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, HBC inhibits AR activity
and suppresses androgen-stimulated proliferation of PCa
cells.
The inhibitory effect of HBC on androgenstimulated AR activity is also evident from the observation
that both PSA and NKX3.1 mRNA levels decreased
dramatically when cells in CSS medium were stimulated
with R1881 in the presence of HBC; R1881 alone restored
the expression of both PSA and NKX3.1 in CSS treated
cells to the levels that were in exponentially growing
cells in FCS (Fig. 4B). Since in-vitro EMSA showed an
inhibitory effect of HBC on the binding of AR to PSAARE (Fig. 3D), we tested the effect of HBC on in-vivo
association of AR with PSA-AREs in R1881-stimulated
LNCaP cells in CSS medium. PCR analysis of AR-ChIP
revealed that R1881 induced the association of AR with
ARE-I and ARE-III, and HBC attenuated R1881-induced

We next tested the effect of HBC on AR activity
stimulated specifically by androgen. As expected, hormone
depletion of LNCaP cells, caused by shifting from
hormone-rich fetal calf serum (FCS) containing medium
to hormone-depleted CSS containing medium, resulted
in a dramatic decrease in protein levels of AR and PSA
(Fig. 4A). Treatment of cells in CSS medium with HBC
further decreased AR protein levels. Addition of R1881
alone to the cells in CSS medium was sufficient to restore
AR and PSA to the levels that were in exponentially
growing cells in FCS containing medium. However,
R1881 treatment in the presence of 20 or 40 µM HBC
attenuated the restoration of AR. Importantly, the effect
on PSA was greater than that on AR level in HBC treated
cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting an inhibitory effect of HBC
on AR transcriptional activity. In addition, as seen in
exponentially growing cells (Fig. 2C), HBC decreased the

association of AR with PSA-AREs (Fig. 4C). Thus, HBC
suppresses AR activity by blocking androgen-dependent
association of AR with AREs.
Since Ser-81 phosphorylation is essential for
AR transcriptional activity [24, 25] and is stimulated
by androgen [26], we tested the HBC effect on Ser-81
phosphorylation of AR in R1881-stimulated cells. As

shown in Fig. 4D, hormone-depletion caused a dramatic
decrease in Ser-81 phosphorylation and R1881-induced a
robust phosphorylation of AR Ser-81 within 4- to 6-hour
treatment of cells in CSS medium, indicating androgendependent phosphorylation of AR in LNCaP cells.
Importantly, this R1881-induced phosphorylation of AR
Ser-81 was completely blocked by HBC, suggesting that

were repressed by HBC are often overexpressed in PCa
(Fig. 5A) and, conversely, those that were stimulated by
HBC are often down-regulated in PCa (Fig. 5B). This
indicates a reversing effect of HBC on the expression of
androgen-regulated genes associated with PCa.
The gene expression changes observed in R1881
vs. R1881 + HBC treated cells were validated by RTqPCR analysis of representative genes (Fig. 5C). Among
these genes were some [viz., PSA, NKX3.1, TMPRSS2,
FKBP5, and CaMKK2 (Fig. 5Ca)] that are known to be
AR-targets and contain AREs, and others that are either
overexpressed [viz., MYC, APLN, OR51E1, MCCC2,
and TM4SF1 (Fig. 5Cb)] or down-regulated [viz., ATF3,
DDIT3, and SQSTM1 (Fig. 5Cc)] in PCa but are not
known to contain AREs, and thus may be indirect targets
of AR. In addition, HBC affected the expression of these
genes similarly in exponentially growing androgensensitive (LNCaP) and castration-resistant (22Rv1) PCa
cells (Fig. 5D).
Since HBC inhibits AR activity by binding to
CaM, we employed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to
identify HBC affected genes that are likely to be regulated
by AR and CaM. IPA identified 84 AR-regulated and 19

HBC effect on global transcriptome in androgenstimulated PCa cells
In order to identify HBC effect on androgenregulated gene expression, we sequenced total RNA
isolated from cells that were subjected to androgendeprivation and then stimulated with R1881 in the absence
or presence of HBC. Deep sequencing analysis revealed a
significant change (with p<0.05 and 1.5-fold increase or
1.5-fold decrease) in 1,766 transcripts representing 1,475
genes and their isoforms in androgen-deprived cells treated
with R1881 in the absence vs. presence of HBC (data
not shown). Genes that were altered most significantly
(p <0.002) among these were 29 androgen-stimulated
genes that were repressed by HBC and 28 androgenrepressed genes that were induced by HBC (Table 1). We
analyzed these 57 genes for their expression in cancer vs.
normal prostate tissues using the Oncomine Platform.
Interestingly, these analyses revealed that the genes that

respectively. Cells treated with 40 µM HBC were used for RT-PCR analysis. Band densities were determined by using the ImageJ program

CaM-regulated genes among the genes that were affected
(p<0.05) by HBC (Fig. 5E and Supplementary Table S3).
In addition, there were six genes, viz., CaMKK2, AKT,
MYC, CCNE1, DCAF6, and FLNA, whose expression
known to be regulated both by AR and CaM that were
down regulated in HBC treated cells (Fig. 5E). These six
gene products are regulated through a direct interaction
between them (Fig. 5F). IPA also identified five significant
(p values ranging from 2.9x10-21 to 8.7x10-9) functional
categories of genes modulated by HBC (Table 2). These

functional categories are relevant to the cell survival,
proliferation, and gene expression. Interaction networks
between genes that were most significantly (p<0.002)
affected by HBC in each of the 5 functional categories is
shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. These network analyses
indicate that HBC inhibits the expression of genes that
promote proliferation and survival, and induces the
expression of genes that promote cell death.

HBC inhibits the growth of tumors derived from
castration-resistant PCa cells in nude mice

may include its inhibitory effect on CaM-modulated p300
acetyltransferase activity required for AR-targeted gene
expression.

Since HBC reversed prostate cancer-associated
gene expression (Fig. 5A and 5B), we anticipated an
anti-tumorigenic effect of HBC. Therefore, we tested the
effect of HBC on the growth of tumors derived from the
castration-resistant metastatic PCa cell line C4-2B in nude
mice. We first evaluated plasma and tissue distribution of
HBC in mice injected with a single dose of 100 mg HBC/
kg body weight. Fig. 6A shows the mean concentrationtime profiles of HBC in plasma, tumor, liver, pancreas,
and spleen following i.p. injection. The plasma and
tissue pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in
Supplementary Table S4. Following ip injection, HBC
was well absorbed into the systemic circulation; achieving
the plasma Cmax of 16.44 μg/mL at 1 h. HBC exhibited
an apparent systemic clearance (CL/F, 5.45 L/kg) similar
to the hepatic blood flow in mice (5.4 L/h). HBC was
rapidly distributed into tumor tissues (Tmax, 0.5 h) and
achieved a tumor drug concentration (i.e., Cmax and AUC0) similar to the systemic (plasma) drug concentration
∝
(Supplementary Table S4). Compared to its elimination
from the plasma, HBC was eliminated relatively slower
from normal and tumor tissues (T1/2, 3.3 to 4.7 h) (Fig. 6A
and Supplementary Table S4).
Based on the pharmacokinetic data, we treated
tumor bearing mice with 100 mg/Kg HBC twice daily/5
days/week. This treatment regimen had no significant
effect on either the body weight of mice (Supplementary
Fig. S4A) or on gross morphology of cells in major organs
such as heart, kidney, liver and lungs (Supplementary Fig.
S4B). However, there was a significant decrease (p <0.05)
in tumor volume in mice treated with HBC starting 18
days after initiation of treatment as compared to controls.
At 23 and 26 days, this difference between tumor volumes
in HBC vs. vehicle treated mice was highly significant (p
<0.01) (Fig. 6B). The HBC-mediated suppression of tumor
growth is due to the suppression of proliferation since the
expression of AR and cyclin A required for proliferation
were suppressed and the expression of p27, which
negatively regulates proliferation, was induced in tumor
tissues (Fig. 6C). The anti-proliferative effect of HBC was
also evident from a noticeable decrease in Ki67 staining
in tumors from HBC treated mice as compared to controls.
Recently, p300 acetyltransferase activity has been
reported to be crucial for AR-targeted gene expression
[27]. Interestingly, p300 activity is regulated by nitric
oxide synthase [22], which is a CaM dependent enzyme
[23]. Therefore, we evaluated acetylation of histone
H3K9, one of the targets of p300, in prostate tumors from
mice treated with HBC. As shown in Fig. 6D, there was
a dramatic decrease in H3 acetyl K9 in tumor tissues of
mice treated with HBC as compared to controls. Thus
the anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic effect of HBC

DISCUSSION

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Current strategies for the treatment of metastatic
PCa rely on an intact AR LBD to inhibit AR activity.
However, in CRPC, AR LBD is sometimes deleted or
mutated rendering AR refractory to all forms of androgendeprivation and/or AR-antagonists currently available
[28, 29]. Therefore, agents targeting AR NTD, which
is indispensable for the transcriptional transactivation
function of AR, to inhibit AR activity are critical to
eliminate the disease. This study identified HBC as one
such agent. We have shown previously that CaM binds
to the NTD of AR and plays an important role in AR
transcriptional activity and AR protein stability [10-12].
In the present study, we showed for first time that CaM
is overexpressed in PCa (Fig. 1) and that HBC, which
binds exclusively to CaM [20], inhibits AR activity and
suppresses the growth of CRPC tumors in nude mice.
We observed a selective inhibitory effect of HBC
on proliferation of AR-positive PCa cells (Fig. 2). Since
CaM is a ubiquitous protein that regulates many cellular
processes [13], the lack of HBC effect on proliferation
of AR-negative cells at concentrations that effectively
inhibited proliferation of AR-positive PCa cells (Fig.
2) is actually quite striking. It indicates that HBC does
not inhibit proliferation simply by inhibiting all CaMregulated proteins; if it did, proliferation of AR-negative
cells should have been similarly inhibited. Since the
CaM-binding domains of different CaM–regulated
proteins differ significantly in amino acid sequence
[30] and structural differences among CaM-binding
domains influence CaM affinity for its target [31], it is
likely that not all CaM-regulated proteins are inhibited
equally by an anti-CaM drug. Indeed, myosin lightchain kinase, protein kinase C, calcineurin, and cAMP
phosphodiesterase are all CaM-regulated enzymes, but
their sensitivity to trifluoperazine (TFP), a potent antiCaM drug, varies significantly; TFP inhibits myosin lightchain kinase, protein kinase C, calcineurin, and cAMP
phosphodiesterase with an IC50 of 140 µM [32], 43.9 µM
[33], 20.8 µM [34], and 12.7 µM [33], respectively. In
addition, the potency of CaM antagonists may also depend
on the intracellular calcium and CaM levels; intracellular
calcium levels can affect the binding affinity between CaM
and its targets [35], and the sensitivity of CaM-regulated
enzymes to anti-CaM drugs. For example, the inhibitory
effect of anti-CaM drugs TFP and R24571 on CaMregulated myosin light-chain kinase activity increases
with increasing CaM levels [32]. Therefore, it is possible
that CaM overexpression in AR-positive PCa cells (Fig. 1,
and [10]) may render CaM-dependent AR activity more
sensitive to the inhibitory effect of HBC.

The HBC inhibitory effect on AR activity
was associated with the suppression of AR Ser-81
phosphorylation (Fig. 4) and suppression of AR binding
to AREs (Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting a role of Ser-81
phosphorylation in AR binding to AREs. This is in
agreement with reports that cyclin-dependent kinases, viz.,
Cdk1 and Cdk9, phosphorylate AR Ser-81 and stabilize
AR binding to chromatin [24, 25, 36]. Protein kinases
play an important role in regulation of AR function and
AR protein stability [37]. Protein kinases activated by
growth factors (e.g., EGF and IGF-1) or cytokines (e.g.,
IL-6 and IL-8) are reported to activate AR in the absence
of androgen [38], and several growth factor-stimulated
protein kinases including Akt [39], Aurora A [40], Src [41],
and cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk1 and Cdk9 [24, 25, 36]
that phosphorylate AR depend either directly or indirectly
on CaM for kinase activity. For instance, whereas CaM
binds directly to and regulates the activities of Akt [42],
Aurora A [43], and Src [44] kinases, the activities of Cdk1
and Cdk9 kinases are activated by CaMKII-dependent
Cdc25C [45] and CaMK1D [46], respectively. Therefore,
it was not surprising that we observed a strong inhibitory
effect of HBC on Ser-81 phosphorylation in LNCaP
cells (Fig. 4B). These observations raise an intriguing
possibility that AR-bound CaM may play a role in the
activation of protein kinases that phosphorylate AR and
regulate its function and stability. Future studies will test
this possibility.
Poor solubility and, therefore, poor bioavailability
is a major obstacle when it comes to the usefulness of
Curcumin and its derivatives as therapeutic agents [47].
However, although HBC is a Curcumin-derivative, it is
more water-soluble than Curcumin since it has additional
carboxy and amine groups [20]. Particularly, the sodium
salt of HBC (NaHBC/CTK7A) is highly water-soluble
and cell permeable [22]. Accordingly, we observed that
NaHBC was well absorbed into the systemic circulation
of mice within 30 min after i.p. injection of 100 mg/kg.
The concentration of HBC was ~25 µM in tumor tissues
(Cmax 12.64 µg/ml) within 1 hour of administration (Fig.
6A and Supplementary Table S4). This concentration
is ~5-fold higher than the IC50 required for its antiproliferative effect on LNCaP cells (Fig. 2A), indicating a
pharmacologically relevant diffusion of HBC into tumors.
This is also evident from the strong inhibitory effect of
HBC on the growth of xenografted tumors in mice (Fig.
6B) [22]. The inhibitory effect of HBC on tumor growth
is likely due to a cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic, effect
since TUNEL assay showed no evidence of apoptosis
(data not shown). Cytostatic effect of HBC is evident
from a noticeable decrease in cyclin A (Fig. 6C) and Ki67
(Fig. 6D), markers of cell proliferation, and an increase in
p27 (Fig. 6C), a negative regulator of cell proliferation.
Thus, HBC suppresses tumor growth through an antiproliferative effect at the concentration (~25 µM) that was
observed in tumor tissues (Fig. 6A and Supplementary
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Table S4). With regards to the safety, it is interesting to
note that despite high HBC levels in liver (58 µg/gm at
30 min), pancreas (68 µg/gm at 1 hour), and spleen (52
µg/gm at 1 hour) (Fig. 6A and Table S5), there were no
noticeable changes in gross morphology (Supplementary
Fig. S4B), suggesting that cells in these normal tissues
are insensitive to HBC. The safety of HBC is also evident
from the observation that there was no significant change
in the body weight of mice treated with 100 mg/kg twice
daily/5 days/week for 4 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S4A)
[22].
In summary, these studies demonstrate for the first
time that HBC, which binds exclusively to CaM, inhibits
AR activity and suppresses the proliferation of both
androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant AR-positive
prostate cancer cells. In a xenograft model, HBC inhibits
the growth of CRPC tumors. Thus, these studies establish
CaM as a viable target to inhibit AR activity through an
AR LBD-independent mechanism and provide proof-ofprinciple for safe and effective usefulness of HBC as a
therapeutic agent to inhibit the growth of CRPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies and reagents
Antibodies against AR-N20, cyclin A, cyclin E,
cyclin D1, Cdk2, PCNA, p53, p27, p21, PARP1, Ki67,
PSA, and actin were all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Dallas, TX), cyclin B from BD Biosiences, (San
Jose, CA), AR-pSer81 and calmodulin from EMD
Millipore (Billerica, MA), and H3 (acetyl K9) from

androgen methyltrienolone (R1881) was from Perkin
Elmer (Waltham, MA). HBC was provided by one of
the investigator (HJK). Sodium salt of HBC (NaHBC/
CTK7A) was purchased from EMD Millipore (Billerica,
MA) and also provided by one of the investigators (TKK).
While HBC was used in studies presented in Figs. 2A,
2B, 3A and 3B, all other studies were carried out using
NaHBC/CTK7A.

Cell lines and cell culture
LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC-3, DU145, and NIH3T3 cell
lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Monassas, VA), C4-2B cells were from
Dr. Fazlul H. Sarkar (Wayne State University School of
Medicine, Detroit, MI) and BPH-1 cells from Dr. Simon
W. Hayward (Vanderbilt University Medical Center,
Nashville, TN). LNCaP, C4-2B, 22Rv1 and BPH-1 cells
in RPMI-1640 medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY), and PC-3, DU145 and NIH3T3 cells in DMEM

medium (Life Technologies) were supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch,
GA), 2.5 mM glutamine, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 100
units/ml penicillin, and grown in a humidified incubator
with 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37OC. The medium for C4-2B
cells also contained 10 mM HEPES.
Experiments with LNCaP cells were carried out
when they were at <15 passages from the time of receiving
from ATCC. Cell proliferation was monitored by pulse
labeling with 3H-thymidine for 1 hour as described
previously [10] or by cell count using a Coulter Counter
(Zf Model, Coulter Electronics, Inc., Hialeah, FL). For
hormone deprivation, exponentially growing LNCaP
cells at a density of 50-70% confluence were shifted
into phenol red-free RPMI medium (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 6% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum
(CSS) (Atlanta Biologicals), 2.5 mM glutamine, 100 µg/
ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin for 36 hours.
In order to test the effect of HBC on androgen-stimulated
events, hormone-deprived cells were then treated with 2
nM synthetic androgen R1881 in the absence or presence
of HBC.

test gene relative to GAPDH (reference) mRNA was
determined using the equation 2-ΔCT, where ΔCT = CT, test –
CT, reference [49]. The primers used for PCR and qPCR were
as in Supplementary Table S1.

Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and PCR
analysis of androgen response elements (AREs)
Preparation of soluble chromatin from LNCaP
cells treated without (control) or with HBC, and the
immunoprecipitation of chromatin using antibodies
against AR-N20 or purified IgG (control) was as described
by Jia et al [50]. DNA purified from ChIP samples was
subjected to PCR analysis using the following PSAAREs primers: 5’-tctgcctttgtcccctagat-3’ (forward) and
5’-aaccttcattccccaggact-3’ (reverse) for PSA ARE-I,
and 5’-gcctggatctgagagagatatcatc-3’ (forward) and
5’-acacctttttttttctggattgttg-3’ (reverse) for PSA ARE-III.
Procedures for PCR reaction and visualization of amplified
products were as described previously [48].

Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)

Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
Cell extracts prepared as described previously [11]
were diluted 10-fold in 250 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris
(pH 7.4) and incubated overnight with 4 µg/ml of antiAR-N20 or anti-CaM antibody at 4OC. The immune
complexes were then adsorbed to protein A/G agarose
immunoadsorbent (Pierce, Rockfold, IL) by incubation
for 1 hour at ambient temperature with gentle agitation.
The adsorbed complexes were washed twice in dilution
buffer by centrifugation at 4OC and eluted with PAGE
loading buffer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Control
immunoprecipitates were prepared by using 4 µg/ml
purified rabbit or mouse IgG (Antibodies Incorporated,
Davis, CA) in place of anti-AR or anti-CaM antibodies.
Western blotting of the samples dissolved in PAGE
loading buffer were carried out as described previously
[11].

Soluble nuclear extracts were prepared from
exponentially growing LNCaP and DU145 cells and
EMSA was performed using DIG High Prime DNA
Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN). The sequences of PSA-ARE
probes used in EMSA were: 5’-tgcagaacagcaagtgctagc-3’
(forward) and 5’-gctagcacttgctgttctgca-3’ (reverse).
Digoxygenin (DIG)-labeled probes were incubated with 5
µg nuclear extract in a binding buffer containing 24 mM
HEPES, pH 7.9, 8 mM Tris HCL, pH 8.0, 12% glycerol,
2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiotreitol, 3 µg BSA, and 1 µg
poly [d(I-C)] in a final volume of 20 µl for 30 min on ice.
Samples were then subjected to 6% native polyacrylamide
gel electrophoreses, transferred onto positively charged
nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science), and PSAARE probe signal on nylon membrane was then detected
using an anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and
chemiluminescence.

RNA isolation, RT-PCR and quantitative PCR
analysis

RNA-Seq and data analysis

Total RNA was extracted from cells with RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocols and RT-PCR was performed
as described previously [48]. Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
was carried out using SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Life Technologies) on an Applied Biosystems
7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The cycle number at which the reaction
crossed a threshold fluorescence (CT) was determined
for each transcript, and the level of expression of each

Total RNA prepared as described above was
submitted to Applied Genomics Technology Center,
Wayne State University School of Medicine, where RNA
integrity was confirmed using Agilent 2000 TapeStation
system, sequencing adaptor ligated cDNA libraries were
constructed using TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit
v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and 50 cycle paired-end
sequencing was done on Illumina HiSeq 2500. Details of
RNA-Seq data analysis can be found in Supplementary

Oncomine Analysis

Immunostaining

A set of 57 genes (Table 1), whose expression was
significantly (p<0.002) affected by HBC, were assessed
for differential expression in cancer vs. normal prostate
tissues by using nine reference data sets in the Oncomine
Platform (Oncomine v4.5, Life Technologies, Ann Arbor,
MI). Each of the reference data sets had an expression
profile of more than 8500 genes in at least 54 prostate
samples (Supplementary Table S2).

Benign and tumor human prostate tissue sections
were obtained with approval from the Institutional Review
Board of Henry Ford Health System. Tissue sections
were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval using
DAKO PT LINK Chamber and immunostained on the
DAKO LINK Autostainer using EnVision FLEX reagents
(DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) by following the manufacturer’s
suggested protocol. Primary antibodies used for staining
were rabbit monoclonal antibodies against CaM (Abcam)
diluted 1:3,500, and mouse monoclonal antibodies against
AR (DAKO) diluted 1:75. Immunostaining of mouse
tissue sections with antibodies against Ki67 and H3
(acetyl K9) was performed manually using reagents from
Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) by following the
manufacturer’s suggested protocol.

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
Functional interactions between the set of genes
whose expression was either decreased or increased
significantly (1,475 gene set with p<0.05, and 57 gene
set with p<0.002) in cells treated with R1881 + HBC,
as compared to R1881 alone, was evaluated using the
Ingenuity curated knowledge base as a reference and
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool (Ingenuity
Systems, Redwood City, CA).

Human prostate tumor xenograft mouse model
The animal protocols were reviewed and approved
by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use
Committee of Henry Ford Hospital. Subcutaneous (s.c.)
injection of C4-2B cells (5 x 106) and measurement of the
volume of tumors derived from C4-2B cells in six week
old male athymic nude mice was as described previously
[51]. When xenografts reached a volume of 175 ± 58
mm3, the tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to
a solvent-treated (control) or HBC-treated group and given
either solvent (100 µl PBS) or HBC intra-peritoneally
(i.p.) 100 mg/kg twice daily for 5 consecutive days/week.
The experiment was terminated when the control tumors
reached ~1,100 mm3 (on day 28) and the mice were
sacrificed. Part of each tumor was used to prepare the
tissue extracts and the remainder was fixed and paraffin
embedded. Tissue extracts for Western blotting were
prepared as described previously [51].
