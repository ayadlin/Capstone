Abstract
Farnesol (FOH) and other isoprenoid alcohols induce apoptosis in various carcinoma cells and inhibit tumorigenesis in
several in vivo models. However, the mechanisms by which
they mediate their effects are not yet fully understood. In this
study, we show that FOH is an effective inducer of apoptosis in
several lung carcinoma cells, including H460. This induction is
associated with activation of several caspases and cleavage of
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). To obtain insight into
the mechanism involved in FOH-induced apoptosis, we
compared the gene expression profiles of FOH-treated and
control H460 cells by microarray analysis. This analysis
revealed that many genes implicated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling, including ATF3, DDIT3, HERPUD1,
HSPA5, XBP1, PDIA4, and PHLDA1, were highly up-regulated
within 4 h of FOH treatment, suggesting that FOH-induced
apoptosis involves an ER stress response. This was supported
by observations showing that treatment with FOH induces
splicing of XBP1 mRNA and phosphorylation of eIF2A. FOH
induces activation of several mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathways, including p38, MAPK/extracellular
signal–regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-ERK, and c-jun
NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Inhibition of MEK1/2 by U0126
inhibited the induction of ER stress response genes. In
addition, knockdown of the MEK1/2 and JNK1/2 expression
by short interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively inhibited the
cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP and apoptosis induced by
FOH. However, only MEK1/2 siRNAs inhibited the induction of
ER stress–related genes, XBP1 mRNA splicing, and eIF2A
phosphorylation. Our results show that FOH-induced apoptosis is coupled to ER stress and that activation of MEK1/2 is an
early upstream event in the FOH-induced ER stress signaling
cascade. [Cancer Res 2007;67(16):7929–36]

Introduction
Isoprenoids are important in the regulation of cell proliferation,
apoptosis, and differentiation (1–6). The nonsterol isoprenoid
farnesol (FOH) is produced by dephosphorylation of farnesyl
pyrophosphate, a catabolite of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway
(7, 8).
FOH and the related isoprenoids perillyl alcohol (POH),
geranylgeraniol (GGOH), and geraniol (GOH) are found in a wide

range of fruits and vegetables (9, 10). Each isoprenoid has been
shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in a number of
neoplastic cell lines from different origins (4, 11–14). In addition,
these isoprenoids have been reported to be effective in chemoprevention and chemotherapy in various in vivo cancer models
(10, 12, 15, 16). FOH has been reported to exhibit chemopreventive
effects in colon and pancreas carcinogenesis in rats (9, 17) whereas
phase I and II clinical trials have indicated therapeutic potential
for POH (16, 18). The mechanisms by which these isoprenoids
induce these effects are not yet fully understood. Isoprenoids have
been reported to inhibit posttranslational protein prenylation (19)
whereas other studies have shown that FOH is a potent inhibitor
of the CDP-choline pathway (5, 20, 21). Other effects include
inhibition of phospholipase D (22), inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG CoA reductase) activity (6),
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS; refs. 23, 24), and
disorganization of the cytoskeleton (4). FOH has also been reported
to act as a weak activator of the farnesoid X activated receptor (25).
To obtain greater insight into the mechanism by which FOH
induces apoptosis, we did microarray analysis and compared the
gene expression profiles between vehicle-treated and FOH-treated
human lung adenocarcinoma H460 cells. This analysis showed that a
large number of genes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress response are rapidly induced by FOH treatment,
suggesting that FOH-induced apoptosis is coupled to the ER stress
response. The ER is an organelle responsible for the synthesis,
posttranslational modification, and proper folding of membrane and
secretory proteins. Disturbance of ER homeostasis results in the
activation of the unfolded protein response (26–29). During this
response, several prosurvival and proapoptotic signals are activated
and, depending on the extent of the ER stress, cells survive or undergo
apoptosis. Several (pathologic) conditions, including nutrient deprivation, oxidative stress, changes in calcium homeostasis, failure in
posttranslational modifications or transport of proteins, and
treatment with a variety of agents, can induce ER stress and trigger
the unfolded protein response. ER stress has been implicated in many
disease processes, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and
neurodegenerative disease, ischemia, and inflammation (30–32).
In this study, we further show that FOH treatment of H460 cells
results in the activation of several mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPK), including p38, extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK)-1/2, and c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-1/2.
Treatment with chemical inhibitors and short interfering RNA
(siRNA) knockdown experiments showed that activation of MAPK/
ERK kinase (MEK)-1/2 is an early event that is upstream of the
activation of the ER stress signaling cascade by FOH.

Cancer Research
Cell lines and cell culture. The human lung carcinoma cell lines H460
(adenocarcinoma), H1355 (adenocarcinoma), H82 (small cell carcinoma),
and Calu6 (alveolar anaplastic carcinoma) and the immortalized human
bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection. The carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 100 units/mL each of penicillin and
streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). BEAS-2B cells were grown in KGM
(Cambrex).
Proliferation and cell death assays. Cell proliferation and viability were
evaluated using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (XTT) following the
manufacturer’s protocol (Roche). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm
using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.). Apoptosis was
measured with a Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche).
Flow cytometry. H460 cells treated with FOH for different time intervals
were harvested, resuspended in PBS, and then fixed in 70% ethanol. Fixed
cells were washed twice in PBS and then resuspended in 0.5-mL propidium
iodide solution consisting of 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide, 0.1 mg/mL RNase
A, and 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Cell cycle analysis was done
with a FACSort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Data were analyzed
using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).
Microarray analysis. Total RNA was isolated using TriReagent (Sigma)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression analyses were
conducted by the NIEHS Microarray Group (NMG) on Agilent Whole
Human Genome microarrays (Agilent Technologies). Total RNA was
prepared from H460 cells treated for 4 h with 250 Amol/L FOH or vehicle
(DMSO). RNA from two independent experiments was used and each
microarray analysis was done in duplicate. Further experimental details of
the microarray analysis are provided in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer
containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, and
0.1% SDS, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails
I and II (Sigma). After centrifugation, proteins were examined by Western
blot analysis with the antibodies indicated (Supplementary Materials and
Methods). The blots were developed with a peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was
isolated using TriReagent following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was
separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5% formaldehyde in 1 MOPS
buffer and then transferred onto a nylon membrane (Sigma). After UV crosslinking, the membrane was hybridized to 32P-labeled probes. The
membrane was then washed and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham
Bioscience) at 70jC. Probes used in Northern blot analysis were generated
by PCR as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods. The
nonconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA was examined by reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using 5¶-CCTTGTAGTTGAGAACCAGG and
5¶-GGGGCTTGGTATATATGTGG as primers. This will amplify both
unspliced (XBP1u) and spliced (XBP1s) XBP1 mRNAs.
SiRNA knockdown. Knockdown of MEK1/2 and JNK1/2 expression in
H460 cells was achieved by transfection of siRNAs. The siRNAs of human
MEK-1, MEK-2, JNK-1, and JNK-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. The silencer-negative control siRNA was purchased from
Ambion. Transfection of siRNA was done with DharmaFECT 4 transfection
reagent. H460 cells were plated in six-well dishes at a density 3.3  105
per well. The next day, cells were treated with the siRNA transfection
mixtures following the DharmaFECT General Transfection Protocol. After
48-h incubation, cells were treated with or without FOH as indicated and
harvested for Western and Northern blot analyses.
Statistics. Values are presented as means F SD. Statistical analysis was
done with the Student t test.

cells and of the immortalized human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B
cells with FOH greatly reduced cell proliferation and viability,
extending previous observations (refs. 2, 5, 6, 11, 14, 20, 33; Fig. 1A).
FOH also reduced the growth and viability of lung adenocarcinoma
H1355 and small cell lung carcinoma H82 cells (not shown). The
concentrations at which FOH inhibited cell proliferation ranged
from 100 to 300 Amol/L. FOH inhibited cell proliferation of H460
cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). At 225 Amol/L, FOH
reduced cell viability by f50% after 24 h of treatment, whereas at
250 Amol/L, <10% of the cells were viable. Comparison of the
growth inhibitory effect of FOH with those of GOH, GGOH, and
POH showed that FOH was the most effective in inhibiting the
proliferation of H460 cells followed by GGOH whereas treatment
with GOH and POH had little effect (Fig. 1C).
To determine whether the FOH-induced cell death in H460 cells
involved apoptosis, we analyzed the cell cycle distribution and the
induction of nucleosome fragmentation. Flow cytometric analysis
showed that treatment of H460 cells with 250 Amol/L FOH induced
a change in cell cycle distribution (Fig. 1D). The percentage of
sub-G0-G1 cells in FOH-treated H460 cultures steadily increased
over a period of 24 h whereas the number of cells in G1, S, and
G2-M greatly diminished. At 12 and 24 h, respectively, 49% and 71%
of the cells were in sub-G0-G1. The cell cycle profile did not
significantly change over a 24 h period in cells treated with vehicle
only (not shown). Nucleosome fragmentation analysis determined
by Cell Death Detection ELISA confirmed that H460 cells treated
for 6 h with 250 Amol/L FOH undergo apoptosis (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk
effectively inhibited nucleosome fragmentation, indicating that
FOH-induced cell death is caused by a caspase-dependent
apoptotic pathway.
FOH induces ER stress and unfolded protein response. To
obtain insight into the early events involved in FOH-induced
apoptosis, we did microarray analysis to determine the gene
expression profiles of H460 cells treated for 4 h with vehicle
(DMSO) or 250 Amol/L FOH. Comparison of the gene expression
profiles identified a large number of genes that were induced or
repressed by FOH in H460 cells.3 Of the 1,480 changes in gene
expression, 537 genes were found to be induced z2-fold and 320
genes were down-regulated z2-fold in FOH-treated H460 cells. A
selective list of genes induced or repressed by FOH is shown in
Table 1. Closer analysis of the gene expression profiles revealed that
among the genes highly up-regulated by FOH, many were typical
for ER stress response signaling. These included the transcription
factors DNA damage–inducible transcript 3 [DDIT3; also named
GADD153], activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), and X-box
binding protein 1 (XBP1); the chaperones HSPA5 (also named
GRP78 or BiP) and HSP90B1 (also named GRP94), protein disulfide
isomerase A4 (PDIA4), and homocysteine-inducible, ER stress–
inducible, ubiquitin-like domain member 1 (HERPUD1; also named
HERP); and pleckstrin homologue-like domain family A1 (PHLDA1,
also named TDAG51). The expression of several members of
the Fos/Jun and a number of early response genes, including
the nuclear receptors Nurr1 (NR4A2) and Nur77 (NR4A1), and
members of the Egr family of transcription factors were also greatly

Farnesol-Induced ER Stress Response

Figure 1. FOH induces cell death in lung carcinoma H460 and Calu6 cells and immortalized bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells. A, cells were treated with FOH for
24 h at the concentrations indicated. Viability is calculated as the percent of control (as percent of the viability of vehicle-treated cells). B, H460 cells were treated
with FOH (225 and 250 Amol/L) or vehicle (DMSO) for the times indicated. C, H460 cells were treated with FOH, GOH, GGOH, or POH for 24 h at the concentrations
indicated. Cell viability was determined by the XTT assay. Points, mean of three separate experiments; bars, SD. D, FOH treatment causes an increase in the
percentage of sub-G0-G1 cells and induces internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. H460 cells were treated with 250 Amol/L FOH and, at the times indicated, collected
for cell cycle analysis.

up-regulated. Many of these genes have been reported to act
downstream in the ER stress signaling cascade (26, 28, 29, 32).
The induction of the expression of several ER stress–related
genes by FOH was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Figure 2A
shows a time course of the induction of DDIT3, ATF3, HSPA5,
XBP1, HERPUD1, and PHLDA1 mRNA expression. An increase in
the expression of these mRNAs was observed within 2 h after the
addition of FOH, and the expression of most mRNAs reached a
maximum at 4 h of FOH treatment. These observations suggest
that the FOH-induced cell death program is coupled to activation
of the ER stress signaling pathway.
To compare the ability of several alcohol isoprenoids to induce
an ER stress response, H460 cells were treated with FOH, GOH,
GGOH, and POH for 4 h at the concentrations indicated and the
induction of DDIT3 and ATF3 expression was examined (Fig. 2B).

www.aacrjournals.org

FOH was the most effective inducer of DDIT3 and ATF3 mRNA
expression in H460 cells followed by GGOH. Treatment with GOH
and POH did not induce these ER stress marker genes. These
results correlate with the effects of these isoprenoids on the
viability of H460 cells and suggest that both FOH and GGOH induce
the unfolded protein response.
ER stress triggers several specific signaling pathways including
the unfolded protein response (26–29, 32). The latter involves the
activation of several proteins including inositol requiring protein 1
(IRE1 or ERN1) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK). Activation of the
RNase activity of IRE1 initiates splicing of XBP1u into XBP1s mRNA,
which is subsequently translated into a potent transcription factor
(34, 35). Our results showed that FOH induced the generation of
XBP1s transcripts (Fig. 2A, bottom). The ER stress sensor PERK
induces the phosphorylation and inactivation of the translation

Farnesol-Induced ER Stress Response

Figure 2. Induction of ER stress–related response
and caspase activation by FOH. H460 cells were
treated with 250 Amol/L FOH and, at the times
indicated, cells were collected and RNA isolated.
A, RNA was examined by Northern blot analysis
with radiolabeled probes for ER stress–related
genes (DDIT3, ATF3, HSPA5, XBP1, HERPUD1,
and PHLDA1 ). ER stress–induced alternative
splicing of XBP1 mRNA was analyzed by
RT-PCR. B, H460 cells were treated with different
isoprenoids, FOH (250 Amol/L), GOH (250 and
800 Amol/L), GGOH (250 and 700 Amol/L), and
POH (250 and 800 Amol/L), for 4 h and expression
levels of ATF3 and DDIT3 mRNA were examined
by Northern blot analysis. Bottom, 18S and 28S
rRNA. C, H460 cells were treated with 250 Amol/L
FOH for the times indicated. Phosphorylation of
eIF2a was examined by Western blot analysis with
an anti–p-eIF2a specific antibody. D, H460 cells
were treated with 250 Amol/L FOH and, at the times
indicated, cells were harvested. Cell lysates were
examined by Western blot analysis with antibodies
against PARP and the caspases indicated. Actin

initiation factor eIF2a, resulting in an attenuation of the rate of
general translational initiation (36). As shown in Fig. 2C, FOH
induced phosphorylation of eIF2a in H460 cells in a time-dependent
manner. These observations suggest that FOH induces the activation
of two important unfolded protein response sensors, IRE1 and PERK.
Several caspases have been reported to be activated in the
unfolded protein response (26–29, 37). Examination of caspase
activation in FOH-treated H460 cells showed that caspase-3 and
caspase-9 were significantly activated at 4 h, similar to the time
course of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (Fig. 2D).
In addition, FOH treatment reduced the level of unprocessed
caspase-4 by f70%, indicating that FOH induces activation of
caspase-4. No activation of caspase-8 was detected.
FOH induces activation of p38, ERK, and JNK. Activation of
MAPKs are involved in many aspects of the control of cellular
proliferation and apoptosis and have been implicated in the
regulation of gene expression in the ER stress signaling cascade
(26–29, 32, 38–40). We therefore examined the effects of FOH on
the activation of several MAPK pathways. As shown in Fig. 3A,
treatment of H460 cells with FOH induced the level of
phosphorylated ERK, p38, and JNK whereas it did not change the
level of total ERK, p38, and JNK protein. An increase in ERK
phosphorylation was observed at 5 to 15 min and reached a
maximum at 60 min. This activation seemed to precede the
phosphorylation of p38 and JNK.
To determine the role of the activation of p38 and ERK1/2 in
FOH-induced ER stress response, H460 cells were pretreated with
the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580
and their effects on the induction of several stress response genes
examined. As shown in Fig. 3B, induction of DDIT3, ATF3, HSPA5,

www.aacrjournals.org

HERPUD1, and PHLDA1 mRNA by FOH was effectively inhibited
by U0126. These results suggest that activation of MEK1/2 is
important for FOH-induced ER stress response and is an upstream
event. SB203580 had a small effect on the increase in DDIT3 and
HERPUD1 mRNA expression but significantly reduced the induction of ATF3 expression. The latter is in agreement with previous
observations showing that p38 MAPK is involved in induction of
ATF3 by stress signals (41).
Induction of ER stress response and apoptosis by FOH is
dependent on MEK1/2 activation. To analyze the role of MAPKs
further, we examined the effect of MEK1/2 and JNK1/2 knockdown
by siRNA on the ER stress signaling cascade. As shown in Fig. 4A,
the MEK1/2 and JNK1/2 siRNAs reduced significantly the
expression of MEK1/2 and JNK1/2, respectively. In addition, these
siRNAs very effectively inhibited FOH-induced apoptosis in H460
cells (Fig. 4B) and the cleavage of PARP and several caspases
(Fig. 4C). The inhibition of the apoptotic cascade was confirmed by
morphologic observations (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We next examined the effects of MEK1/2 and JNK1/2 knockdown
on the induction of several ER stress–related genes. As shown in
Fig. 5A, siMEK1/2 significantly reduced the induction of DDIT3,
ATF3, HSPA5, HERPUD1, and PHLDA1 mRNA expression by FOH,
consistent with the observed inhibition by U0126 (Fig. 3B). In
contrast, knockdown of JNK1/2 by siJNK1/2 had little effect on the
expression of these ER stress–related genes. Transfection of
siMEK1/2 also inhibited XBP1 mRNA splicing whereas siJNK1/2
had no effect. These observations suggest that activation of MEK1/2
is upstream of IRE1 activation whereas JNK activation is a
downstream event. The latter conclusion is in agreement with
previous studies (27–29, 32, 39, 40).

Figure 3. Treatment of H460 cells with FOH induces
activation of ERK, p38, and JNK. A, H460 cells were
treated with 250 Amol/L FOH for the time intervals
indicated. Cell lysates were examined by Western blot
analysis with antibodies against phosphorylated ERK
(p-ERK ), total ERK, phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38
MAPK ), total p38 MAPK, phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK),
and total JNK. B, H460 cells were pretreated with MEK
inhibitor U0126 (10 Amol/L) or p38 MAPK inhibitor
SB203580 (10 Amol/L) for 30 min and then treated with
250 Amol/L FOH. Total RNA was isolated 4 h later and
examined by Northern blot analysis with radiolabeled
probes for DDIT3, ATF3, HSPA5, HERPUD1, and PHLDA1
mRNA expression. Bottom, 18S and 28S rRNA.

As expected, knockdown of siMEK1/2 greatly reduced total
MEK1/2 protein and, as a consequence, the level of phosphorylated
MEK1/2. Knockdown of MEK1/2 expression also inhibited the
induction of phosphorylated JNK by FOH without affecting the
total level of JNK1/2 protein (Fig. 5B). In addition, PERK-induced
phosphorylation of eIF2a by FOH was greatly diminished in H460
cells transfected with siMEK1/2. These results are in agreement
with the conclusion that activation of MEK1/2 is upstream in the
ER stress signaling cascade.

Discussion
In this study, we show that FOH is able to induce apoptosis in a
number of human lung carcinoma cell lines, as indicated by the
activation of several caspases, and the induction of PARP cleavage
and nucleosomal degradation. The mechanism by which this
isoprenoid induces apoptosis in a variety of cell systems is not yet
fully understood (4, 5, 11–14). The objective of this study was to
obtain greater insight into the mechanisms involved in the
induction of apoptosis by FOH. We therefore did microarray

analysis and compared the gene expression profiles between
human lung carcinoma H460 cells treated for 4 h with FOH or
vehicle (DMSO). This analysis showed that FOH induced the
expression of a great number of genes typically associated with ER
stress response signaling, including ATF3, DDIT3, XBP1, HSPA5,
HSP90B1, PDIA4, HERPUD1, and PHLDA1 (26, 28, 29, 32). These
observations suggested that FOH induces an ER stress response.
The ER plays a critical role in the regulation of protein synthesis,
protein folding, and trafficking. A wide variety of signals have been
reported to disrupt ER function and induce ER stress, which is
associated with an accumulation of unfolded or malfolded proteins
in the ER (26, 28, 29, 32). Activation of the ER stress response leads
to attenuation of protein synthesis to prevent the accumulation of
more proteins, the translocation of unfolded or malfolded proteins
and their degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system,
induction of chaperone synthesis to increase folding capacity,
and induction of apoptosis. The ER stress response is a balance
between prosurvival and proapoptotic signaling pathways. When
the prosurvivor responses fail, cells undergo apoptosis, as seems to
be the case in FOH-treated H460 cells.

Figure 4. Knockdown of MEK1/2 or JNK1/2 expression by siRNAs inhibits FOH-induced apoptosis. H460 cells were transfected with siMEK1/2, siJNK1/2, or control
(scrambled) siRNAs for 48 h before they were treated with or without 250 Amol/L FOH. A, cell lysates were prepared and examined by Western blot analysis with
antibodies against total MEK1/2 and JNK1/2. B, cells were treated with FOH for 6 h before they were assayed for apoptosis by Cell Death Detection ELISA. C, cells
were treated with FOH for 4 h. Cell lysates were then examined by Western blot analysis to determine the processing of PARP and the caspase indicated. Actin is shown
as a loading control. Columns, mean of three separate experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.0001, versus control siRNA group.

Farnesol-Induced ER Stress Response

Figure 5. Knockdown of MEK1/2 expression by siRNA
reduces the induction of ER stress–related response
by FOH. A, H460 cells were transfected with control
(scrambled) siRNA, siMEK1/2, or siJNK1/2 and, 48 h later,
treated for 4 h with 250 Amol/L FOH. Total RNA was
then isolated and examined by Northern blot analysis for
checking the mRNA level of several ER stress–related
genes. Bottom two, the effect of the siRNAs on ER
stress–induced alternative splicing of XBP1 mRNA
was analyzed by RT-PCR. B, control siRNA and
siMEK1/2-transfected cells were treated with 250 Amol/L
FOH for 1 h. Cell lysates were examined by Western blot
analysis with antibodies against p-MEK1/2, MEK1/2,
p-JNK, JNK, and p-eIF2a. Actin is shown as a control for
equal loading.

ER stress triggers the activation of several sensor proteins,
including PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 (27–29, 32). FOH treatment seems
to activate both IRE1 and PERK because FOH induces splicing of
XBP1 mRNA and phosphorylation of eIF2a. Splicing of XBP1
mRNA has been reported to depend on the activation of the RNase
activity of IRE1 (34, 35) and to result in the synthesis of a potent
XBP1 transcription factor. Phosphorylation of eIF2a is catalyzed
by PERK. Phosphorylated eIF2a causes a decrease in the rate of
translation initiation of many proteins but enhances the translation of the transcription factor ATF4 (26–29, 32, 42). ATF4 and
XBP1 in combination with ATF6 regulate the transcription of
several ER stress–related genes, including ER luminal chaperones
HSPA5, HSP90B1, and PDIA4 and the transcription factor DDIT3.
These observations support the conclusion that FOH induces an
ER stress response.
Treatment with FOH, as has been shown for other ER stress–
inducing conditions, results in the activation of the MAPK family
members p38, ERK, and JNK (29, 32, 39, 40). In response to ER
stress, IRE1 becomes activated through autophosphorylation
and recruits tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 2
(TRAF2), an adaptor protein involved in the signaling pathways of
proinflammatory cytokines. This complex in turn activates
apoptosis signal–regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and subsequently the
MAPK kinase 4-JNK pathway (39, 40) and, possibly, the p38
pathway. The IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1-JNK pathway is an important
pathway in ER stress–induced apoptosis. Our results show that
knockdown of JNK1/2 expression did not inhibit activation of IRE1
but inhibited caspase activation and the induction of apoptosis in
H460 cells by FOH. However, JNK1/2 siRNAs had little effect on
the induction of most ER-stress–related genes analyzed (Fig. 5A).
Our observations are consistent with the concept that JNK
activation is dependent on IRE1 activation and suggest that
activation of IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1-JNK pathway plays a critical role in
FOH-induced apoptosis.

Activation of the MEK-ERK signaling pathway is generally
considered as a prosurvival signal. However, activation of ERK1/2
has been reported to play a significant role in the induction of
apoptosis in renal, neuronal, and hepatoma cells by a variety of
conditions (43, 44). Our study shows the importance of the MEKERK signaling pathway in the FOH-induced ER stress response.
This is indicated by the inhibition of the induction of ER stress–
related genes by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. Moreover, knockdown of MEK1/2 expression in H460 cells by siRNA inhibited the
FOH-induced splicing of XBP1 mRNA, eIF2a phosphorylation,
activation of JNK1/2 and several caspases, the induction of several
ER stress–related genes, and apoptosis. These observations suggest
that activation of the MEK1/2 signaling pathway is an early event
and critical in triggering FOH-induced ER stress.
This raises the question on what mechanism FOH activates the
MEK-ERK pathway. FOH has been reported to generate ROS in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (24, 45) and ROS has been shown to
induce activation of ERK1/2 in mammalian cells under several
conditions (46, 47). Preliminary results showed that FOH enhances
ROS in human lung carcinoma cells.4 Therefore, generation of ROS
by FOH may result in the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway and
subsequently trigger the ER stress response. However, activation of
the ERK1/2 pathway might be related to other actions of FOH,
including inhibition of the CDP-choline pathway (5, 20, 21, 48) and
inhibition of phospholipase D (22) or HMG CoA reductase activity
(6). Future studies have to provide insight into the mechanism by
which FOH activates the MEK-ERK pathway.
FOH also induces the expression of several members of the
Egr family, transcription factors that are important regulators of
apoptosis and cell proliferation. Egr1 has previously been shown to

be induced during ER stress (49) and has been implicated in the
regulation of several genes, including ATF3 (50). Therefore, the
induction of ATF3 in FOH-treated H460 cells might be related to
the observed increase in Egr1 expression. The induction of ATF3 in
FOH-treated H460 cells also depends on the activation of p38
MAPK, in agreement with a previous report showing that ATF3 is a
p38 target gene (41). These observations indicate that the
transcriptional regulation of genes downstream in the ER stress
signaling cascade might be regulated by multiple kinase pathways
and transcription factors that affect their transcription either
synergistically or antagonistically.
In summary, in this study we show that FOH-induced apoptosis
in human lung carcinoma cells is coupled to the activation of an ER

stress response that includes activation of the sensors IRE1 and
PERK. In addition, we show that this induction is dependent on the
activation of the MEK-ERK signaling pathway, suggesting that it is
an early event in FOH-induced ER stress and apoptosis.
