BACKGROUND: An important goal of noncurative therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is tumor burden (TB) control. However, to the authors’ knowledge, the impact of TB characteristics on clinical outcome has not
been studied in patients with mRCC who were treated with vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy.
METHODS: Patients with clear cell mRCC who were treated with sunitinib between June 2004 and October 2007
were retrospectively identified. Computed tomography scans were re-reviewed from baseline, at the time of maximal
TB shrinkage (TS) while receiving sunitinib, and at the time of progressive disease (PD). Measurements were
recorded as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). RESULTS: A total of 69 patients were identified. The majority (54%) were classified as being of favorable risk using Cleveland Clinic Foundation Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitor (CCF TKI) risk group criteria. All patients underwent prior nephrectomy and 77% received prior systemic
therapy. There were a median of 8 metastatic deposits across all organs (range, 1-27 deposits). The median TB at the
initiation of therapy was 14.0 cm (range, 3.0 cm-42.2 cm). On multivariable analysis, baseline characteristics of disease confined to above the diaphragm (P ¼ .03) and a total TB <13 cm (P ¼ .09) were found to be independent positive predictors of progression-free survival. Aþ baseline, total number of metastases <10 (P < .001) and TB above the
diaphragm <6.5 cm (P ¼ .05) were found to be independent positive predictors of overall survival (OS). Increased TS
while receiving sunitinib was found to be significantly associated with OS (P < .001). At the time of PD, tumor location and pattern of disease progression were not found to be associated with survival as measured from the date of
PD. However, total TB (P ¼ .003) and total number of metastatic deposits (12 vs >12; P < .001) were found to be significant predictors of survival after PD. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicate that TB characteristics
are associated with clinical outcome in patients with mRCC who are treated with sunitinib. Cancer 2011;117:1183–9.

KEYWORDS: tumor burden, sunitinib, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, overall survival, progression-free survival.

The management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has undergone significant advancements in recent years.
This has been achieved primarily through the elucidation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway and
its integral role in the biology of RCC. As a result, several VEGF pathway inhibitors have been developed to treat patients
with mRCC. Through several randomized controlled trials, VEGF pathway inhibitors such as sunitinib,1,2 sorafenib,3
bevacizumab,4,5 and pazopanib6 have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes. Given these superior outcomes, VEGF
pathway inhibitors have now become the standard of care in patients with mRCC.
Despite these advances, there is still a great deal of information to be discovered regarding the behavior of mRCC
treated with VEGF-inhibiting agents. Prognostic criteria incorporating baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics
have been developed in the era of VEGF-targeted therapy.7,8 Although these models identify select criteria to help estimate prognosis, to the best of our knowledge, the impact of TB on clinical endpoints such as progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) have not been well studied to date. The idea of tumor burden (TB) correlating with survival was suggested in a study examining growth rate constants of renal carcinomas.9 In this study, an estimate of TB at

the time of death was determined based on the calculated
growth rate and the median survival of patients on the
study. This was used to compare how growth rates and
survival change while patients are on or off treatment
with bevacizumab. Another study retrospectively examined both TB and growth rate constants using computed
tomography (CT) measurements in patients with mRCC
who were treated with ixabepilone.10 Here, TB was identified as having a strong correlation with OS, suggesting that
the amount of tumor impacts clinical outcome in patients
with RCC. Given these observations, it was hypothesized
that the amount and location of mRCC, both before and
during therapy with sunitinib, would be associated with
clinical outcome independent of known prognostic variables. Therefore, a retrospective review of patients with
mRCC who were treated with sunitinib was conducted
comparing TB characteristics with patient outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with clear cell mRCC who were treated with
sunitinib at the Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute
between June 1, 2004 and October 5, 2007 were retrospectively identified. CT images were re-reviewed by an
investigator blinded to clinical outcome from 4 predefined time points: 1) baseline (the CT scan immediately
before the initiation of therapy with sunitinib); 2) at the
time of maximal TB shrinkage (TS) while receiving
sunitinib; 3) at the time of progressive disease (PD) as
per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
(RECIST); and 4) at the time of last radiographic assessment before death/last visit. TB and percentage of TS
were measured as per RECIST (version 1.0).11 Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were collected via
review of the electronic medical record under a protocol
approved by the Institutional Review Board.
Statistical Analyses
PFS and OS were calculated from the date treatment with
sunitinib was initiated to the date of confirmed PD or
death, respectively; both outcomes were summarized
using the Kaplan-Meier method. All patients who developed PD eventually died. In the analysis of survival after
documented PD, survival from PD (SfP) was calculated
from the date of PD rather than from the initiation of
therapy with sunitinib because patients developed PD at
various times and relating factors present at the time of
PD to OS could be biased. A recursive partitioning algo-

rithm was used to identify cutoff points for the different
TB variables studied, which included whether disease was
present above or below the diaphragm (or both); the overall baseline soft tissue TB; the soft tissue TB present above
and below the diaphragm, respectively; the ratio of soft
tissue TB above and below the diaphragm; the number of
organ sites involved; the total number of metastases present; and the number of bony and nonbony metastases present. Univariable analyses of PFS, OS, and SfP were
performed using the log-rank test and Cox proportional
hazards model. Univariable analyses of objective response
(OR) and TS were conducted using chi-square tests and the
Wilcoxon rank sum test. The McNemar test was used to
compare metastatic sites present before the initiation of
sunitinib and those present at the time of PD. Multivariable
analyses of PFS and OS initially considered all the factors in
Tables 1 and 2 and used Cox proportional hazards models
with stepwise variable selection to identify independent
prognostic factors. The analyses of the association between
maximum TS and outcome treated TS as a time-varying
covariate. All tests of statistical significance were 2-sided and
all analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software
(version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 69 patients were identified. Baseline characteristics were typical of a mRCC population (Table 1). The
majority of patients (54%) were classified as being of
favorable risk based on Cleveland Clinic Foundation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (CCF TKI) risk group classification. All 69 patients underwent prior nephrectomy. The
majority of patients (73%) had received some form of
prior systemic therapy, which was predominately immunomodulatory in nature (65%). At the time of last followup, 86% of patients had developed PD at a median of
13.5 months, and 49% of patients had died at a median of
31.0 months.
The lung (87% of patients) and mediastinal lymph
nodes (52%) were the most common sites of metastatic
disease (Table 2). Overall, patients had a median of 3
organ sites of metastatic disease (range, 1-8 organ sites)
regardless of whether one considered sites of bone metastases separately or combined into a single ‘‘site.’’ The median total number of metastases across all organ sites was 8
(range, 1-21 metastases) and the median number of nonosseous metastases was 7 (range, 1-20 nonosseous metastases). The median total TB was 14.0 cm (range, 3.0 cm42.2 cm), with a median TB above the diaphragm of 8.3
cm (range, 0 cm-22.6 cm) and a median TB below the diaphragm of 4.2 cm (range, 0 cm-26.0 cm), with TB above
the diaphragm defined as lung and/or mediastinal metastases and TB below the diaphragm defined as metastases

nodes, kidney, and/or adrenal glands. The ratio of median
TB above the diaphragm to that below the diaphragm was
2.2.
Baseline Characteristics in Relation to
Clinical Outcome
Baseline factors were analyzed to determine their relation
with PFS and OS via both univariable and multivariable
analyses, and the univariable data are summarized in Table 3. On univariable analysis, CCF TKI risk group (P <
.001), 2 sites of disease (P ¼ .004), 6 metastases overall (P ¼ .01), 8 metastases excluding bone (P ¼ .02),
TB 13 cm (P ¼ .02), TB below the diaphragm <3 cm
(P ¼ .02), disease confined to above the diaphragm (P ¼
.02), and a higher ratio of the TB above the diaphragm (P
¼ .03) were found to be associated with improved PFS.
On multivariable analysis, disease confined to above the
diaphragm (P ¼ .03) (Fig. 1 Top), total TB 13 cm (P ¼
.09) (Fig. 1 Bottom), and CCF TKI risk group (P < .001)
were found to be independent predictors of PFS.
Similar results were observed with respect to OS.
Several TB-related factors were found to be associated
with outcome on univariable analysis: CCF TKI risk
group (P < .001), total number of metastases <10 (P <
.001), 2 bone metastases (P < .001), 4 metastatic sites
(P < .001), 8 metastases excluding bone (P ¼ .005),
lower total TB (P ¼ .01), and TB above the diaphragm
6.5 cm (P < .001). However, on multivariable analysis
only total number of metastases <10 (P < .001) (Fig. 2
Top) and tumor volume above the diaphragm 6.5 cm

Tumor burden parameters are presented using the categorization found to be optimal for the particular outcome. However, if a parameter was not associated with an outcome at all, the categorization used with the other outcome is presented. For example, the number of bony metastases was not associated with PFS, but was found to be prognostic for
OS. Therefore, the categorization used in the OS analysis is also presented in the PFS analysis.

TB Characteristics at Best Response in
Relation to Clinical Outcome
The overall RECIST-defined OR rate was 52%, with a
median time to best response of 3.2 months (range, 0.9
months-22.1 months). Approximately 87% of patients
had some degree of TS, with a median TS of 31%. No
baseline TB characteristics were found to be correlated
with OR or TS. To address whether TS while receiving
sunitinib was associated with OS, maximum TS was
treated as a time-varying covariate in a proportional hazards model. From this analysis, increased maximum TS
while receiving sunitinib was found to be significantly
associated with OS (P < .001).

TB Characteristics at Time of PD in
Relation to Clinical Outcome
Approximately 86% of patients had developed PD at the
time of data analysis. The median survival from the time
of RECIST-defined PD was 13.1 months (95% confidence interval, 7.4 months–20.8 months). With the
exception of 1 patient who developed acute cholecystitis
and required surgery, all other patients discontinued sunitinib at the time of RECIST-defined PD. Volume
increases at existing sites of metastases were noted in 83%
of patients, 46% of patients had metastases in different
organs at the time of PD, and 52% of patients had new
metastases in previously involved organs. Table 4 compares the pattern of disease involvement at baseline and at
time of PD. Bone, mediastinal lymph nodes, and the
brain had significantly more involvement at time of PD
compared with at baseline (P ¼ .05, .05, and .005, respectively). The most common sites of new organ involvement
were the spine (20%), brain (15%), and lymph nodes
(mediastinal, 8% and retroperitoneal, 8%). Lung, bone,

and lymph nodes (mediastinal and retroperitoneal) were
the most commonly involved sites both at baseline and at
PD. Tumor location at the time of PD was not found to
be associated with OS from the time of PD. However,
total TB (P ¼ .003) and total number of metastatic deposits (12 vs >12; P < .001) at the time of PD were found
to be significantly associated with OS from the time of
PD.

DISCUSSION
A deeper understanding of RCC characteristics in relation
to outcome with VEGF-targeted therapy is desired to
optimize clinical outcomes with targeted therapy. In this
retrospective analysis of patients with mRCC who were
treated with sunitinib, several features of TB were found
to be associated with clinical outcome after adjustment for
known prognostic variables.
At baseline, a lower total TB, fewer metastatic sites,
and a lower TB above the diaphragm were significantly
associated with improved survival. This may reflect an
inherently more indolent underlying biology because
patients who start therapy with less TB are likely to have

slower growing disease. However, these factors remained
significant even after adjusting for established baseline
prognostic factors, which further supports the observed
association. These data may also have implications for the
timing of the initiation of systemic therapy. There is a
subset of patients with mRCC who present with low-volume, slow-growing metastatic disease. Clinical practice in
a subset of such patients could include an initial period of
observation until an as yet undefined TB threshold or
pace of growth is reached. Recent data have emerged suggesting an association between calculated growth rate
constants and survival in mRCC patients.9,10,12 It is interesting to note that data from 1 of these trials found baseline TB to have a strong correlation with OS but found an
even stronger correlation with OS when growth rate constant and initial TB were combined.10 Although it
requires prospective study, this concept supports the

notion that treatment decisions based on the growth and/
or volume of disease in patients with mRCC may be plausible (eg, delaying the initiation of therapy or allowing
treatment holidays). This is particularly important given
the largely noncurative nature and toxicities of existing
systemic therapies. The biology of a lower TB above the
diaphragm at baseline relating to better outcomes is
poorly understood. Given that disease above the diaphragm is more prevalent in this cohort, it may simply be
a surrogate for overall TB. Conversely, different metastatic sites may indeed have an inherently different biology
as related to response to VEGF inhibition, ultimately
affecting clinical outcome. This is observed through the
empiric observation that patients with liver metastases
tend to have a poorer prognosis in some series compared
with patients with lung or mediastinal involvement. This,
in part, may account for why disease confined to above
the diaphragm was found to be an independent predictor
of PFS. From these observations, it is clear that the biology of individual organ metastases in patients with RCC
requires further investigation.
In addition, these data suggest that a sunitinibinduced decrease in TB is associated with a reduction in
the risk of death. This supports what has been increasingly
recognized with the routine use of VEGF-targeting
agents, namely, that TB reduction not meeting traditional
RECIST criteria for an OR (30%) can be associated
with clinical benefit.13 Furthermore, these data support
that the degree of TB reduction with therapy remains an
important predictor of outcome.

1188

When we assessed patterns of PD, several interesting
features emerged. Although progression of existing sites
accounted for the majority of cases of PD, new organ sites,
namely the bone and brain, represented a substantial and
significant percentage of sites of PD. These data support
in part an organ-specific effect of VEGF-targeting agents,
and possibly that these sites may be sanctuaries in which
the effect of VEGF targeting has a reduced antitumor
effect. To our knowledge, it remains unclear how to manage a patient with an isolated site of PD (eg, bone or brain)
with otherwise adequate control of the remaining TB, and
further investigation is needed. Another plausible hypothesis is that greater overall tumor control with sunitinib
allows patients to develop metastases in organ sites (eg,
bone and brain) that would otherwise not have been
observed with shorter survival. Tumor location at the
time of PD was not found to be associated with survival,
but greater TB and a greater number of disease sites were
significant, underscoring the importance of amount of tumor over tumor location.
There are several limitations to the current study.
This was a retrospective review of a small number of
patients who were treated at a single RCC referral center
and therefore is subject to the inherent limitations of such
a study, including limited power, patient selection bias,
and variable scan interval. In addition, evaluation of the
amount and location of tumor and TB reductions were
assessed by investigators, with radiology reports used as
reference. Such an analysis may not accurately capture the
exact locations of all tumors or the amount of tumor at

each site. Finally, tumor necrosis without size change is
believed to be indicative of an antitumor effect of sunitinib and other targeted agents, but such change would not
be reflected in TB measurements based on size.
Overall, the findings of the current study provide
insight into how TB characteristics over time influence
outcomes in patients with mRCC who are treated with
sunitinib. These data require further evaluation in larger,
prospectively defined data sets to integrate them into the
routine management of patients with mRCC.
