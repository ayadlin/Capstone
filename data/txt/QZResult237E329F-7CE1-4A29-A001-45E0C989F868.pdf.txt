ABSTRACT
Mutations and epigenetic alterations are key events in transforming normal cells
to cancer cells. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the B-cell,
is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis especially for those patients who are
resistant to the frontline drugs. There is a great need to describe the molecular basis
and mechanism of drug resistance in MCL to develop new strategies for treatment.
We reviewed frequent somatic mutations and mutations involving the B-cell pathways
in MCL and discussed clinical trials that attempted to disrupt these gene pathways
and/or epigenetic events. Recurrent gene mutations were discussed in the light of
prognostic and therapeutic opportunity and also the challenges of targeting these
lesions. Mutations in the ATM, CCND1, TP53, MLL2, TRAF2 and NOTCH1 were most
frequently encountered in mantle cell lymphoma. Translational models should be built
that would assess mutations longitudinally to identify important compensatory, prosurvival and anti-apoptic pathways and actionable genetic targets.

INTRODUCTION

great need to overcome resistance and developing new
strategies to improve clinical outcome of these patients.
Genetic alterations might hold the key to understanding
treatment refractoriness.
The objective of this review was to identify
frequent gene mutations in MCL, discuss their potential
as therapeutic targets and summarize the current state
of knowledge about the clinical trials that affect these
mutations through therapeutic agents. Future directions
on how to utilize genetic aberrations in treating MCL is
also discussed.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell, nonHodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) with poor prognosis. Newer
approach to treatment largely focused on modulating the
B-cell signaling pathways to inhibit tumor proliferation
[1-5]. A multitude of drugs have been developed and also
under development that target specific B-cell signaling
pathway components. The spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)
inhibitor, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor,
phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor and the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have
been studied actively in pre-clinical settings and in clinical
trials. Of these, BTK inhibitor ibrutinib showed durable
efficacy in relapsed MCL as a single agent and currently
considered drug of choice in the treatment of relapsed/
refractory cases [6]. However, acquired and primary
resistance to ibrutinib has caused disease progression [7,
8]. As increasing number of patients are being treated
with the frontline agents including but not limited to
ibrutinib, drug resistance is emerging as a bottleneck in
the treatment of and potential cure for MCL. There is a

SOMATIC MUTATION AND EPIGENETIC
EVENTS
Somatic mutation plays a very important role in
transforming normal cells to cancer cells, regardless of
the tissues affected or age of the patients[9]. Apart from
somatic mutation, the epigenetic events such as chromatin
modification and DNA methylation have also been
recognized as key elements in cancer progression [10-12].
Since MCL is a B-cell lymphoma, the B-cell signaling

pathways downstream from receptor activation is crucial
in understanding mechanism of drug resistance. Mutations
could affect the involving pathways either at a receptor
level or downstream. This raises the possibility of cancer
cells evading therapeutic agents that target specific B-cell
pathway components. With the advent of next generation
sequencing (NGS) technologies through whole genome
sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES)
and miRNA expression profiling [13, 14], studies are
increasingly reporting molecular alterations among cancer
cells. This provides a great tool to profile gene mutations
in MCL and to explore the possibility of using the
mutations as prognostic variables. The mutation profiling
could potentially increase the probability of therapeutic
success. Understanding the prevalent gene mutations in
MCL might provide insight into the complex interplay of
genes; their proteins and how to possibly overcome drug
resistance.

mantle cell lymphoma international prognosis index
(MIPI) stratifies MCL patients into low, intermediate
and high risk groups based on clinical prognostic factors
[17]. However, genetic mutations such as TP53, CCND1
have been reported as important molecular markers that
has prognostic value and could improve the MIPI index
[18-20]. The mutational information could correlate
with treatment outcomes providing the opportunity of
“personalized medicine” for patients at different spectrum
of the disease. Greater understanding of genetic mutations
at diagnosis and following treatment could potentially
allow altering treatment path, essentially guiding clinical
practice in MCL in future.

RECURRENT SOMATIC/ EPIGENETIC
MUTATIONS IN MCL
The somatic mutations and epigenetic lesions in
MCL are summarized in Table 1. We reported 11 mutated
and/or deleted genes with rank orders in terms of the most
to the least frequencies as reported by six studies that
described somatic/ epigenetic mutations in MCL. A total of
552 patients samples’ were used for mutational analysis by
all six studies. Bea et al. [21] described somatic mutations
in 29 MCL cases followed by a targeted sequencing of
an independent cohort of 172 MCL patients. Twenty
of 29 (69%) of the samples were collected at diagnosis
while 21% were collected pre-treatment and 10% at
progression/ relapse of the disease. Eighty percent of the
patients were at Ann Arbor Stage IV and most (60%) of
the samples were collected from peripheral blood and
about 30% from lymph nodes [21]. The most frequently

DIVERSE PROGNOSIS OF MCL AND THE
NEED FOR “PERSONALIZED MEDICINE”
The clinical prognosis of MCL is a diverse spectrum
which could be explained by the genetic heterogeneity
of the tumor. At one end we have indolent MCL while
others suffer from very aggressive refractory disease.
Among younger patients, high dose chemotherapy
followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is
considered the standard consolidation therapy [15, 16].
However, majority of MCL patients are older and acute
and late toxicities associated with high dose chemotherapy
question the appropriateness of such approach. The

mutated gene that Bea et al. [21] identified was ATM
(41.4%), CCND1 (34.5%), TP53 (31%), MLL2 (14%),
WHSC1 (10%), BIRC3 (6%), NOTCH2 (5%), NOTCH1
(5%), MEF2B (3%) and TLR2 (1%). Similar frequency
of specific mutations was observed by Greiner et al. [22];
they found mutated and/or deleted ATM (40%) and TP53
(26%) in MCL cases who were cyclin D1-positive among
a cohort of 92 untreated patients [22, 23]. The genetic
landscape of MCL has been described by Zhang et al. [24]
among a cohort of 56 cases of which 44 (78.5%) tumor
samples were collected from lymph nodes with 28 (50%)
corresponding normal tissue, mostly from bone marrow.
Zhang et al reported ATM (42.8%), CCND1 (16%) and
RB1 (10.7%) as the most frequent mutations in MCL.
They included a comprehensive list of 37 mutated genes
identified by the study although we included mutations
that are reported by more than one study in Table 1. Apart
from these somatic genes reported above, the MLL3 (16%)
and TRAF2 (14%) are reported by two separate studies to
be frequently identified in MCL cases [24, 25]. The MLL
is epigenetic modifier whereas the TRAF2 is a somatic
gene involved in the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-KB)
pathway which is discussed below.
Among a cohort of 108 patients, 92% of whom
were biopsied at diagnosis, Kridel et al. [26] reported
NOTCH1 mutation in 12% of the clinical samples.
Similarly, Meissner et al. [27] reported frequency of
somatic mutation among a cohort of 102 patients with
94% samples collected at diagnosis, 79% of the patients
at stage III or IV (Table 1). They reported UBR5 mutation
among 18% of the patients which were not described
in MCL prior to this study. UBR5 could play a crucial
role in the pathogenesis in MCL as it has roles in DNA
damage response, cell cycle control in addition to E3

ligase function [28, 29]. Among the CCND1 positive
patients, the prevalence of MYC and BCL-2 aberration
were reported as 36% and 24% with only MYC being the
independent factor for poor survival [30]. These mutations
could have great implications in the prognosis in MCL as
patients with primary resistance to ibrutinib were reported
to be more likely to express novel mutations [31].
Taking the cue from previously reported somatic
mutations, Rossi et al [32] explored the clinical relevance
of recurrent mutations in MCL. They performed deep
sequencing analysis of a panel of genes (ATM, CCND1,
TP53, MLL2/ WHSC1, BIRC3, TRAF2 and NOTCH1)
in a prospective phase III trial. In their preliminary data,
they concluded that young patients may benefit from
the combination of two genetic biomarkers, TP53 and
MLL2 (also known as KTMD2) in a cytarabine-based
chemotherapy followed by ASCT. In their data, even
intensive chemotherapy was not able to reverse the
negative prognostic impact of TP53 mutation.

MUTATIONS INVOLVING THE B-CELL
SIGNALING PATHWAYS IN MCL
When the receptors presents on the membrane
of the B-cells bind to external ligands, a complex
network of intracellular signaling pathways ensues. The
function and survival of the B-cell is largely dependent
upon these pathways which are interconnected. When
a somatic mutation involves the signaling pathway,
there is disruption to the regulation of the cell activity.
Several B-cell signaling pathways are implicated in the
pathogenesis of MCL. However, we will be focusing on
relevant pathways that were reported to harbor mutations
in MCL. Five main pathways were described in the B-cell
58640

signaling that are targets for somatic mutations: the B-cell
receptor (BCR) pathway, the toll like receptor (TLR)
pathway, the NOTCH signaling pathway, Nuclear factor
kappa-beta (NF-KB) pathway and the mitogen activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway[33]. Although, there
were quite a few genes that were found to be mutated in
several B-cell neoplasms, in MCL the BIRC2/BIRC3, the
TRAF2/TRAF3 and NOTCH1 are the somatic mutations
described to date that affect the B-cell signaling pathways
(Table 2).
The mutations in TRAF2 or BIRC3 are associated
with resistance to ibrutinib therapy. As B-cell receptor
(BCR) modulator, ibrutinib indirectly inhibits the
classical NF-KB pathway. However, the TRAF2 mutant
cells were reported to depend on the alternate NF-KB
pathway which is, inturn, dependent on the activation of
the protein kinase NIK (also known as MAP3K14). Rahal
et al. [25] described the NIK dependency of the BIRC3
or TRAF2. In essence, the loss of function of either of
these two genes (TRAF2 or BIRC3) due to mutation leads
to the NIK activity. Because of this dependency there
is potential for NIK as a therapeutic target among those
patients who are resistant to BCR pathway signaling
inhibitors such as ibrutinib. To date, we do not have a
potent inhibitor of NIK in clinical settings although work
is underway for discovering compounds with potent
activity[34]. In multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines, two
NIK inhibitors were able to demonstrate selective toxicity
for cells that had mutations that activate the alternate NFKB pathway[35]. In the same MM cell lines, cells with
mutation in classical NF-KB pathway were not affected
by the NIK inhibitors demonstrating the NIK dependency
of the alternative NF-KB.
The BIRC3 mutation mentioned above has the
potential for direct transformation to cancer cells
independent of the NF-KB signaling[36]. The BIRC2/
BIRC3 mutated cells lack the RING finger domain;
and there could be molecular targets that mediate these
somatic mutations driven carcinogenicity which is yet to
be described. As a result of this potential direct effect of
the BIRC3 mutation, the approach to overcome ibrutinib
resistance through a combination of NIK inhibitor and
BTK inhibitor could lead to treatment failure among those
patients that harbor the somatic mutation. Future works
should assess the treatment response among patients who
have genetic lesions in TRAF2/BIRC3 and those who do
not harbor mutation in these genes.
The C481S gene located at the binding site of BTK
has been described as the first relapse-specific secondary
gene mutation [37]. Because of the mutation, ibrutinib’s
affinity to the enzyme is weakened which led to ineffective
BTK inhibition. In the persistent BTK and AKT/mTOR
pathways which were secondary to the mutation, the
CDK4 mediated cell proliferation occurred. PD 0332991
known as palbociclib which is a CDK4 inhibitor was able
to induce prolonged G1 arrest in such cells. Thus, those
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients with the mutated BTK (C481S) would benefit
from a combination of ibrutinib and CDK4 inhibitors.

MUTATIONS AND CLINICAL TRIALS IN
MCL
Table 3 summarizes the clinical trials that used drugs
that involve the mutated genes among MCL patients.

ATM
This genetic lesion is the most frequent mutation
described among MCL. The gene, known as the Ataxia
Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) is a tumor suppressor gene
which encodes a protein that signals DNA damage. The
role of ATM mutation alone is debated in MCL and it was
reported that ATM mutation, on its own, may not affect
patient’s overall survival [22, 32]. However correlation
of ATM with TP53 aberration could lead to important
phenotype. As a result of the ATM mutation, cells have
impaired apoptosis and defects in the double strand break
(DSB) repair[38]. The intermediary in the DNA damagerepair process is the enzyme poly ADP-ribose polymerase
(PARP) which recruit proteins to the damaged sites of the
DNA[39]. This provided the opportunity for therapeutic
intervention of the enzyme by PARP inhibitors in ATM
deleted lymphoid tumors. Olaparib and veliparib are
two PARP inhibitors that have been used either alone or
in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents and
enhanced cyto-toxicity in ATM deleted MCL cell lines by
PARP inhibitors were reported [40, 41]. We did not find
any clinical trials among MCL patients that used PARP
inhibitors. However, a phase I trial of veliparib was not
beneficial among two patients with small cell lymphoma
[40]. Another phase I trial of PARP inhibitor CEP-9722,
Gemcitabine and Cisplatin has been completed recently
but no study results are posted yet (NCT01345357).
Cells with ATM deletion/ dysfunction show
increased radio-sensitivity. This is potentially important
as a therapeutic strategy in treating MCL. In clinical
practice, fear of radiotoxicity in normal tissue resulting
from ATM inhibition limits the use of radiotherapy among
patients who have dysfunctional ATM. In an innovative
experiment, Moding el al. showed that ATM deletion
preferentially radio-sensitizes the tumor endothelium
not affecting normal cardiac endothelium in the mice
model [42, 43]. By using the stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT), in which relatively high dose of radiation
(40-60 Gy) is delivered in 1-5 fractions, the tumor cells
can be targeted with a curative intent as described by
Moding et al[44]. While this body of work is in the mice
model, data from MCL patients indicate that radiation
is indeed an effective treatment modality even among
heavily pretreated and chemo-refractory patients [45].
Furthermore, unlike sarcoma MCL is a radiosensitive

Therefore, using radiotherapy with a curative intent in
ATM mutated MCL patients is an attractive strategy.

MCL showed partial response [49] (Table 3). A phase II
trial with larger sample size for MCL (n = 28) conducted
in Canada with single agent flavopiridol did not show
promising outcome. The overall response with no prior
therapy was only 11% (6% with prior therapy), 23 (82%)
of the patients had either partial response or stable disease
for 3.4 months [50]. When combined with fludarabine and
rituximab, MCL patients (n = 10) had 80% ORR [51]. A
combination of flavopiridol and bortezomib achieved no
response in MCL[47]. PD 0332991 (palbociclib)- another
flavopiridol that inhibits the CDK4, has been shown to
cause synergistic induction of PIK3IP1 and inhibit the
PI3K-AKT pathway activation which overcomes the
acquired mutation and resulting resistance to ibrutinib[37,
53].

CCND1
Cyclin D1 is a member of a family of three types
of cyclin genes which is not expressed in normal B-cells.
The epigenetic event in the pathogenesis of MCL is
the common translocation t(11;14) which leads to the
deregulated expression of the cyclin D1 protein and
proliferation of B lymphocytes[46]. The cyclin D1 protein
works in conjunction with cyclin dependent kinases
(CDK) such as the CDK4/ CDK6. The CDK inhibitors
such as flavopiridol have been tried in MCL either alone or
in combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
[47-51]. A natural flavonoid found in turmeric called
curcumin has been shown to down regulate the CCND1 in
MCL cells lines [52].

be an alternative therapeutic strategy for a subset of MCL
patents. High response rate of ABT-199 as a single agent
in relapsed/refractory cases were reported in CLL and
its combination with other agents such as rituximab and
bendamustine has achieved impressive ORR in CLL[69].

malignancies including MCL.

protein and inhibit the HDAC enzyme that regulate
the transcriptional and post translational processes[4].
We reviewed seven clinical trials that used HDAC
inhibitor either alone or in combination with rituximab
or everolimus. Two MCL patients in a phase I study of
vorinostat showed stable disease (SD) and complete
remission (CR) (unconfirmed)[54]. In a phase II study
in Japan, the efficacy of vorinostat (HDAC inhibitor)
alone could not be estimated (the overall response could
be between 0-60%)[55]. For refractory or relapsed cases
of MCL (n = 9) the OS was reported to be 16.9 months
for single agent vorinostat with SD in only one patient
[56]. Vorinostat, in combination with rituximnab achieved
33% overall response rate (ORR) among MCL patients
(n = 3) in a different phase II trial in California, U.S[57].
Panobinostat, another HDAC inhibitor showed 100%
partial response (PR) in combination with everolimus
among three patients with MCL[58]. When combined with
the RICE regimen, vorinostat was 60% sensitive to MCL
cells from five patients[59]. Another single agent HDAC
inhibitor, abexinostat only achieved 15% ORR for MCL in
the preliminary results of an ongoing trial[60]. In a phase
I/II trial, Evans et al [61] reported 27% ORR for single
agent abexinostat among a cohort of 11 MCL patients.

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
We reviewed literature published in the last 10
years that describe recurrent gene mutations in mantle cell
lymphoma and their role in the treatment bottleneck of
drug resistance. We identified from studies that conducted
next generation sequencing of MCL patients’ samples
that ATM, CCND1, MLL2, TP53 and BIRC3 are among
the most frequent recurrent somatic gene mutations in
MCL. One important translational feature is that by
stratifying patients at diagnosis based on their TP53 and
MLL2 mutational status, the benefit of a specific therapy
(cytarabine-based chemotherapy) could be predicted
among young patients[32]. Similar works need to be done
to validate patient-stratification strategies based on tumor
mutation among other patient populations. Of the somatic
mutations that we reviewed, ATM kinase mutation was the
most frequent. This has interesting translational potential
of targeting ATM deleted/ mutated MCL cases with low
dose radiotherapy (RT). RT has been effective in indolent
MCL and also among relapsed/refractory cases [45].
Combining RT along with targeted therapy might provide
durable remission. We have reviewed the ATM mutation
and radio-sensitivity in MCL and the therapeutic potential
of RT elsewhere.
For the B-cell signaling pathways, we reviewed
mutation in the BTK enzyme (C481S), NOTCH1, TRAF2
and BIRC3. Of these, BTK mutation (C481S) is associated
with secondary ibrutinib resistance and thus identifying
this mutation longitudinally might be an effective strategy
to save valuable time and to select other non-BTK options.
Indeed, in the BTK resistant setting, several important
anti-apoptic (such as BCL-2) and B-cell pathways (PI3KAKT)/ (alternative NF-KB) might be up-regulated. The
BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 achieved impressive response in
CLL and studies in MCL are actively pursuing treatment
options with ABT-199 which might provide a treatment
breakthrough. Translational models should be developed
so that these alternative survival mechanisms can be
monitored prospectively. These alternative pathways can
be targeted in the context of drug resistance and such data
may guide clinical decision making. We have developed
first patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model in
MCL previously [70] that used primary cells collected
from patients injected into a fetal bone chip that provided
the tumor microenvironment. The PDX model provided

TP53/NOTCH1/BIRC3/TRAF2
As mentioned before, the TP53 and ATM are
interrelated; both are involved in the regulation of
apoptosis and cell cycle. Targeting the wild type TP53 by
inhibiting the endogenous regulator HDM2 and also by
non-HDM2-mediated peptide inhibitor has been tried in
solid tumors [62, 63]. We did not find any clinical trial
among MCL patients involving these agents.
For NOTCH1 mutation, γ-secretase inhibitor was
used in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia but not in MCL[64].
Similarly, we did not find clinical trials among MCL
patients targeting the BIRC3, or TRAF2/TRAF3 mutations.

BCL-2
BCL-2 is an anti-apoptic protein and which is
highly expressed in NHL. In an ongoing phase I study
(NCT01328626), BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 showed
notable response as a monotherapy in MCL. The ORR
was 48% for nine MCL patients with one complete
remission[65]. Among 56 patient-samples in cell cultures
as well in the xenografted MCL, targeting BCL-2 by ABT199 resulted in synergistic growth inhibition with ibrutinib
[66]. Similar synergistic growth inhibition and induction
of apoptosis was reported by Zhao et al[67] when ibrutinib
was combined with ABT-199 in MCL cells. Indeed, MCL
cell lines and primary MCL cells were highly sensitive
to BCL-2 inhibitor (ABT-199) regardless of ibrutinib
sensitivity[68]. It is possible that in presence of ibrutinib

a suitable platform to test drug efficacy in vivo and also
has excellent clinical potential to guide therapeutic choice
[71]. We are currently initiating the first adaptive trial
in MCL based on the PDX platform and an exploratory
objective of the trial is to evaluate mutations before and
after treatment. This would allow assessing the impact of
gene mutations on success and failure of novel therapies
in MCL and may help unblock the drug-resistance
bottleneck.
It is apparent from our review, that majority of the
somatic mutations described by the studies were either
at diagnosis or pre-treatment phase with only a smaller
subset of patients being relapsed/refractory. Thus, future
works should assess mutations among treatment refractory
patients to better understand the correlation of postulated
survival pathways and clinical heterogeneity. Stratifying
MCL patients by tumor mutations would require validation
from further studies that include diverse sub-groups of
patients. The clinical trials that targeted specific mutation
previously (such as flavopiridol, HDAC inhibitors) have
not led to major improvement in overall survival. With
progression of the disease, one sees increasing number of
genetic aberrations that was not present originally. Thus,
mutations that were present at diagnosis or pre-treatment
should be compared with mutations at disease progression.
These analysis could identify important compensatory,
pro-survival and anti-apoptic pathways and actionable
genetic targets.

Increased reporting of somatic mutations opened
up a great opportunity to profile frequent genetic lesions
in MCL. A combinatory approach with frontline agents
and agents that target specific genetic aberration might be
helpful for durable remission. Since multitudes of drugs
are currently available that target different components of
the cell signaling pathways, dynamic adaptive trials that
could promptly assess patients’ genetic aberrations and
potentially switch treatment is the next cornerstone to
combat drug resistance in MCL.
