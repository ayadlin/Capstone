NF-kB Regulates Radioresistance Mediated By b1-Integrin in
Three-Dimensional Culture of Breast Cancer Cells
Kazi Mokim Ahmed, Hui Zhang, and Catherine C. Park

Abstract
b1-integrin induction enhances breast cancer cell survival after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), but the
mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. Although NF-kB initiates prosurvival signaling pathways post-IR,
the molecular function of NF-kB with other key elements in radioresistance, particularly with respect
to extracellular matrix-induced signaling, is not known. We discovered a typical NF-kB–binding site in the
b1-integrin promoter region, indicating a possible regulatory role for NF-kB. Using three-dimensional
laminin-rich extracellular matrix (3D lrECM) culture, we show that NF-kB is required for b1-integrin
transactivation in T4-2 breast cancer cells post-IR. Inhibition of NF-kB reduced clonogenic survival and
induced apoptosis and cytostasis in formed tumor colonies. In addition, T4-2 tumors with inhibition of NF-kB
activity exhibit decreased growth in athymic mice, which was further reduced by IR with downregulated
b1-integrin expression. Direct interactions between b1-integrin and NF-kB p65 were induced in nonmalignant breast epithelial cells, but not in malignant cells, indicating context-speciﬁc regulation. As b1-integrin
also activates NF-kB, our ﬁndings reveal a novel forward feedback pathway that could be targeted to enhance
therapy. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3737–48. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Aside from well-known genetic and epigenetic alterations,
increasing evidence suggests that microenvironmental factors
substantially contribute to acquired or developed cancer therapy resistance (1, 2). Integrins, a family of transmembrane cell
surface receptors, are composed of 18 a and 8 b subunits, that
critically mediate cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions
(3). b1-integrins are aberrantly expressed in human breast
carcinomas and play multifaceted roles in determining cell
fate, effecting cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion,
metastasis, and tissue organization (4, 5). Similar to other
integrin receptors, b1-integrins are overexpressed in various
cancers, including breast cancers, and have been shown to
mediate tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy (6, 7) and
radiation therapy (8, 9). Therefore, understanding b1-integrin-mediated signaling is crucial for the optimization and
development of innovative chemo- and radiotherapeutic
approaches.

Several experimental models have shown the efﬁcacy of b1integrin inhibitors to inhibit metastasis in colon and breast
models, refractory tumors, and advanced metastatic disease
(10–12). Targeting of b1-integrin has also shown strong potential to sensitize cancer cells to conventional radiotherapies and
chemotherapies (13–15). In addition to preclinical studies,
clinical trials evaluating b1-integrin antagonists are still ongoing. To date, 3 b1-integrin inhibitors have been or are being
evaluated in clinical trials: ATN-161, volociximab (M200), and
JSM6427. In contrast to these anti-integrin monotherapies that
target speciﬁc a/b integrin heterodimers and have only been
tested as monotherapy so far and with limited efﬁcacy, AIIB2
(b1-integrin function–blocking antibody), used in this study,
may be more effective as it targets multiple integrins simultaneously. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms
of b1-integrin-mediated resistance to radiotherapy remain
largely unclear.
NF-kB, a stress-sensitive heterodimeric transcription factor
in the regulation of the stress-responsive genes, is activated
upon phosphorylation and proteolysis of IkB or by an IkBindependent pathway (16). Tumor cells express high levels of
constitutive NF-kB activity (17), leading to increased cell
survival via antagonism of apoptotic pathways (18). NF-kB
has been directly implicated in the cellular resistance to
radiation and chemotherapy (19). IR-induced NF-kB activity
is associated with enhanced survival in human leukemic K562
cells (20) and papillomavirus-transformed human keratinocytes (21). In addition, the link between constitutive NF-kB
activity, basal apoptosis, and radiosensitivity has been
reported in breast carcinoma cell lines (22, 23). Thus, the
elevated NF-kB activity identiﬁed in human tumors may lead
not only to apoptosis suppression but also to radiotherapy

resistance. However, the cooperative function of NF-kB with
other key stress elements in radioresistance remains to be
elucidated.
Recently, we discovered that a typical binding site for NFkB was located in human b1-integrin promoter. In our
previous studies, we have shown that downmodulation of
b1-integrin, via inhibitory monoclonal antibody AIIB2, effectively synergizes with IR to modify Akt-mediated radioresistance in breast cancer cell lines in three-dimensional
laminin-rich extracellular matrix (3D lrECM) cell culture
model (8, 24). In addition, we showed that AIIB2 dramatically enhanced radiotherapy efﬁcacy in human breast cancer
xenografts (13). Thus, we hypothesized that b1-integrinmediated resistance to radiation may be functionally regulated by NF-kB. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the relationship between NF-kB and b1-integrin
pathways in radiation-induced cell death in malignant
breast cells in an in vitro 3D culture and tumor growth in
vivo. Here, we show that upon b1-integrin inhibition, radiosensitization is regulated by NF-kB via increased transcriptional activity, and a loop-like b1-integrin–NF-kB–b1-integrin pathway is activated post-IR. Our results suggest a
promising approach to radiosensitize malignant breast cancers by targeting NF-kB/b1-integrin pathways.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The isogenic cell lines, nonmalignant S1 and malignant
T4-2 cells, from the HMT3522 human breast cancer progression series were maintained as described previously
(25). The cell series was established in an attempt to
recapitulate the stochastic and prolonged nature of breast
cancer progression by continuously culturing S1 cells,
derived from reduction mammoplasty, in the absence of
serum followed by EGF removal and injection into mice, to
give rise to T4-2 cells (26, 27). The S1 cells were propagated
as monolayers on plastic in the presence of 10 mg/mL EGF
(BD Biosciences); the T4-2 cells were grown as monolayers
on dishes coated with collagen type I (Vitrogen 100, Celtrix
Laboratories) in the absence of EGF. Three dimensional
(3D) cultures were prepared by growing S1 and T4-2 cells to
conﬂuence as monolayers, followed by trypsinization and
seeded as single cells (8.5  105 cells/mL) at the density of
2.5  104 cells/mL and 1.8  104 cells/mL, respectively, into
EHS matrices (Trevigen). Human breast cancer cell lines
MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection, and maintained in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM/F12; UCSF Cell Culture
Facility, San Francisco, CA) with 5% FBS and penicillin/
streptomycin.
Apoptosis and proliferation assays
Apoptosis and proliferation were detected using terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and indirect immunoﬂuorescence of Ki-67 nuclear antigen, respectively, in samples taken from 3D lrECM at
day 6 (MCF-7) and 7 (T4-2 and MDA-MB-231; Figs. 2A and 4A)
as described previously (28).

Confocal microscopy
Confocal images were acquired by using a Zeiss LSM 710
inverted laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an
external argon laser. Using a Zeiss Fluor 40W (1.3 numerical
aperture) objective, images were captured at the colony midsection. Relative immunoﬂuorescence intensity of images was
standardized by comparing only cultures that were processed
identically and stained in the same experiment.
Other materials and methods
Radiosensitivity assay, Western blotting, immunoﬂuorescence, NF-kB DNA-binding assays, real-time PCR analysis,
immunoprecipitation, in vivo caspase-3/7 activity assay, tumor
inhibition assay in nude mice, immunohistochemistry stainings, and statistics are described in the Supplementary Information section.

Results
NF-kB inhibition sensitizes human malignant breast
cancer T4-2 cells to ionizing radiation
We have previously shown that malignant T4-2 colonies are
signiﬁcantly more resistant to radiation-induced death compared with nonmalignant counterpart S1 acinar structures in
3D lrECM (13). We used clonogenic survival assays to verify
that malignant T4-2 cells indeed had increased reproductive
capacity compared with S1 cells post-IR (Fig. 1A). In addition,
b1-integrin inhibition by AIIB2 monoclonal antibody increased
radiosensitivity in T4-2 cells (Fig. 1B). It is well documented
that NF-kB is activated by IR and plays a central role in
radiation resistance (23, 29). The activity of NF-kB is largely
regulated by its subcellular localization. Using immunoﬂourescence for p65 (a major subunit of NF-kB), we measured the
effect of IR on the activation of NF-kB in T4-2 and S1 cells in 2dimensional (2D) monolayer culture. In S1 cells, 4-Gy IR rarely
induced nuclear translocation of p65. In contrast, nuclear p65
was observed in 8.6% of Sham-irradiated T4-2 cells and 59% of
T4-2 cells exposed to 4-Gy at 4 hours (Figs. 1C and D). Using a
microwell colorimetric assay, we also found that NF-kB DNAbinding activity was signiﬁcantly increased in a time-dependent manner in T4-2, but not S1, cells after exposure to 4-Gy Xray. To determine the binding speciﬁcity, oligos with intact
binding site for NF-kB (wild-type) or the mutated site (mutated) as a competitor for p65 binding to the NF-kB consensus
sequence were used. The addition of a 10-fold molar excess of
the wild-type oligo signiﬁcantly competed for binding of p65 to
the NF-kB consensus sequence; however, no competition was
observed with a 10-fold molar excess of the mutated oligo (Fig.
1E). In addition, using TFBIND software, we discovered that an
NF-kB–binding site (gggaggcccc; -96 to -87) was located in the
human b1-integrin promoter region (Fig. 1F). These results
indicated that b1-integrin–mediated radioresistance of T4-2
cells is regulated by NF-kB. If NF-kB positively regulates b1integrin, inhibition of NF-kB activity should increase radiosensitivity. To test this, NF-kB activity was inhibited by 4Methyl-N-(3-phenylpropyl)benzene-1,2-diamine (JSH-23) and
then colony formation assay was conducted. As shown in Fig.
1B, JSH-23 resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in surviving clones.
Overall, these ﬁndings show that b1-integrin is a novel target of

NF-kB in radioresistance of breast cancer cells, but not nonmalignant human mammary epithelial cells.
NF-kB activation is required for radiation-induced b1integrin overexpression
In a 3D laminin-rich ECM (lr-ECM)–based cell culture model
(Fig. 2A; experimental schema), which better mimics physiologic growth conditions than 2D cultures (8, 30–32), malignant
breast cancer T4-2 cells showed higher levels of total and
phospho (T788/789) b1-integrins compared with its counterpart nonmalignant S1 cells (Fig. 2B). These protein levels were
further induced in T4-2 cells post-IR (4-Gy X-ray; Fig. 2C).
Interestingly, treatment of T4-2 colonies, formed at day 4, with

NF-kB inhibitors JSH-23 or IMD-0354, resulted in a decrease in
phospho and total b1-integrins, which was further reduced by
IR (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S1A). At 30 mmol/L concentration of JSH-23, which selectively blocks nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 and its transcription activity, both
phospho and total b1-integrins were signiﬁcantly reduced
independently of radiation exposure. (Fig. 2C). IMD-0354, an
IKK-b inhibitor that blocks IkB-a phosphorylation and NF-kB
availability, also signiﬁcantly reduced phospho and total b1integrins by 5 mmol/L and 10–20 mmol/L, respectively, with or
without IR (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similarly, IR-induced
increases in b1-integrin mRNA expression were signiﬁcantly
reduced by JSH-23 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). To

conﬁrm inhibition of b1-integrin activity, phosphorylation of
FAK397, a critical indicator of downstream b1-integrin signaling, was measured. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1B,
inhibition of b1-integrin by NF-kB inhibitor JSH-23 signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of total and phosphorylated FAK.
These results clearly show that IR-induced b1-integrin expression and its downstream signaling are mediated by NF-kB.
Similar to b1-integrin, protein levels of p65/p50, the major
inducible NF-kB dimer, were also higher in T4-2 than S1 cells

(Fig. 2B). We prepared whole-cell lysates for immunoblotting of
p65 and p50 to determine whether NF-kB transactivation
following IR was associated with an increase in p65/p50 levels.
Compared with Sham (0 Gy) IR control cells, a clear increase in
p65/p50 was observed post-IR; in addition, these levels were
decreased by JSH-23 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2E).
Together with Fig. 2C, these results indicate that NF-kB and
b1-integrin are components of a coordinated response to
radiation.

NF-kB Regulates b1-Integrin–Mediated Radioresistance

Next, we asked whether transcriptional activity directed
through NF-kB was involved in the upregulation of b1-integrin
post-IR. To determine this, we conducted an ELISA-based DNA
binding assay in 3D lrECM to quantify the binding of NF-kB to
its binding site identiﬁed in the b1-integrin promoter (Fig. 1F).
A 50 bp oligo containing the kB binding site on the b1-integrin
promoter region was synthesized and then used as a DNA
probe to assess binding of IR-activated NF-kB in T4-2 and S1
cells. As shown in Fig. 2F, NF-kB DNA-binding activity was
much higher (4-fold) in T4-2 compared with S1 cells and 4-Gy
X-ray signiﬁcantly increased binding activity. However, the
binding activities were not induced with or without radiation
when a 50 bp DNA probe containing a mutation in the kB site
was used. To test the generalizability of these results, the
induction of DNA binding activity of NF-kB observed in T42 cells post–4-Gy X-ray was conﬁrmed in another cell line
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Similar to T4-2 cells, binding activities were signiﬁcantly increased (3.8-fold) post-IR in human
malignant breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. As expected, this
induction of DNA binding of NF-kB was abolished when the
mutated probe was used. Together, these data identiﬁed b1integrin as a downstream transcriptional target of NF-kB in 3D
lrECM T4-2 cell cultures.
Inhibition of NF-kB activity reduces colony size via
increasing apoptosis and decreasing proliferation in
malignant breast cancer colonies in 3D lrECM
We showed previously that inhibition of b1-integrin by
monoclonal antibody AIIB2 signiﬁcantly increased TUNELpositive nuclei and decreased Ki-67–positive nuclei in a panel
of malignant breast cancer colonies (28). Figure 2 shows that
NF-kB positively regulates b1-integrin, which suggests that
NF-kB inhibition may reduce the colony size via increasing
apoptosis and decreasing proliferation in malignant breast
cells. To test this hypothesis, malignant T4-2 colonies and
nonmalignant S1 acini on top of 3D lrECM gels with 5%
Matrigel formed at day 4 and 6, respectively, were treated with
NF-kB inhibitor JSH-23 and then exposed to sham or a single
dose of 4-Gy X-ray 24 hours after treatment. Upon NF-kB
inhibition, T4-2 colony size was signiﬁcantly reduced at 48
hours. IR further reduced the size in a dose-dependent manner
(data for 20 and 30 mmol/L were not shown; Figs. 3A and B). The
maximum size difference was reached in colonies treated with
40 mmol/L JSH-23 and exposed to IR, associated with a substantial approximately 40% decrease in the average colony
diameter. In contrast, the average diameter of S1 acini was only
marginally reduced by 20–40 mmol/L JSH alone, and no further
reduction was observed by the addition of IR (data for 10 and 30
mmol/L were not shown; Supplementary Figs. S3A and S3B).
Next, to correlate the decrease in colony size by JSH-23 with
apoptosis and proliferation in malignant breast cells, immunoﬂuorescence (IF) staining for TUNEL and caspase-3/7 activity assay, and IF staining for Ki-67 nuclear antigen, respectively,
were conducted. Consistent with the decrease in size of T4-2
colonies by JSH-23 as described above, TUNEL-positive nuclei
were signiﬁcantly increased in sham-treated colonies and a
further induction was observed after IR exposure (Figs. 3A and
C). At the concentration of 40 mmol/L JSH, a 5.8 times increase

www.aacrjournals.org

in TUNEL-positive nuclei was observed compared with control
cells post-IR (8% versus 49%; Fig. 3C). To verify IR- and JSH-23–
induced apoptosis, we conducted a caspase-3/7 activity assay
(Fig. 3D). A 9-fold induction of caspase activity was observed by
JSH-23 (40 mmol/L) alone, which was further increased with IR.
The combined treatment of JSH-23 or b1-integrin inhibitory
AIIB2 monoclonal antibody with IR was associated with the
highest caspase activity compared with either single agent
used alone. In addition, we analyzed the effect of caspase
inhibition by applying the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK
and found that Z-VAD-FMK reversed apoptosis mediated by
NF-kB inhibition with or without IR, further supporting the
ﬁnding that NF-kB inhibition induces apoptosis of T4-2 cells.
In addition, the induction of apoptosis by JSH-23IR was
associated with a decrease in proliferation. A signiﬁcant
decrease in the percentage of Ki-67–positive cells with JSH23 treatment was observed in sham IR cells, which was further
reduced by IR in a clearly dose-dependent manner (data for 20
and 30 mmol/L were not shown; Figs. 3A and E). The maximum
reduction of proliferation was observed in T4-2 colonies treated with 40 mmol/L JSH-23 compared with control cells post-IR
(33% versus 11%; Fig. 3E). Together with Fig. 2, these results
provide strong evidence that b1-integrin–induced resistance
to IR is regulated by NF-kB.
To test whether the increase in radiosensitivity by NF-kB
inhibition is a common mechanism for other malignant breast
cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were seeded in
3D lrECM (experimental schema is shown in Fig. 4A) to
examine the percentage of TUNEL- and Ki-67–positive cells
with JSH-23 treatment with and without IR. As shown in Figs.
4B and D, the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly increased in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells and
further induced post-IR. We did ﬁnd a differential sensitivity to
JSH-23 among the cell lines. Notably, the level of apoptosis was
lower in MCF-7 cells than T4-2 (34% versus 49%) and MDA-MB231 (34% vs. 44%) cells after treatment with 40 mmol/L JSH-23
post-IR, indicating less relative sensitivity in this cell line. To
reach the percentage of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells that was
similar to T4-2 or MDA-MB-231, a higher concentration of
JSH-23 was required (Figs. 3C and 4B and D). Similar dosedependent ﬁndings were reﬂected in the degree of cytostatic
response, measured by the percentage of Ki-67–positive cells
(Figs. 4C and E). Although we treated MCF-7 cells with higher
concentrations of JSH-23 (60 and 80 mmol/L), the percentage of
Ki-67–positive cells remained higher than T4-2 and MDA-MB231 cells post-IR (Figs. 3E and 4C and E). These results indicate
that b1-integrin may be differentially regulated by NF-kB
among different malignant breast lines.
Interactions of b1-integrin with NF-kB p65 and
a5-integrin are oppositely regulated in S1 and T4-2
cells post-IR
NF-kB physically and/or functionally interacts with many
proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival (23). In
light of our current results that IR-induced b1-integrin is
regulated by NF-kB, we used immunoprecipitation to test
the hypothesis that NF-kB physically interacts with b1integrin. This showed that NF-kB p65 was able to interact

protein levels of b1-integrin and p65 were high in T4-2 and
further induced post-IR compared with S1 cells (Figs. 2B, C,

interaction in T4-2 than S1 cells. However, we found that the
interaction was strikingly absent post-IR in relatively resistant T4-2 cells and was enhanced in nontumorigenic S1 cells
(Supplementary Figs. S4A and S4B; marked with a box).

but not in malignant cells. As we have shown previously (8),
the interaction of b1-integrin with one of its heterodimeric
partners a5-integrin was almost absent in S1, but very high
in T4-2, cells without radiation. Although IR slightly induces
a5b1-integrin complex in both S1 and T4-2 cells, the level of
interaction was much higher in T4-2 than S1 cells post-IR

(Supplementary Fig. S4C; marked with arrows). Together
with Supplementary Figs. S4A and S4B, these results suggest
that the induction of physical interaction of b1-integrin with
a5-integrin, but not with p65, promotes radioresistance in
malignant breast cancer cells in 3D lrECM. The exact mechanism underlying the interaction of b1-integrin with p65 and
a5-integrin in radiosensitivity is the subject of ongoing
investigations.
Inhibition of NF-kB activity results in tumor growth
inhibition in vivo associated with downregulated b1integrin expression
To test whether the in vitro observations in 3D lrECM
culture could be validated in vivo, we examined tumor
growth from mice injected with vehicle or NF-kB–inhibited
T4-2 cells exposed to sham or 4-Gy X-ray. As shown in the
tumor growth curves (Figs. 5A and B), NF-kB inhibition by

20 mmol/L of JSH-23 in T4-2 cells (T4þJSH) signiﬁcantly
delayed the growth of tumors relative to control in athymic
mice. We also found that tumors exposed to IR post-JSH-23
treatment (T4þJSHþIR) grew dramatically slower than control. The signiﬁcant suppression of tumor formation was
observed at day 13 after a subcutaneous injection of T4þJSH
or T4þJSHþIR cells and continued till the day of sacriﬁce
(day 28).
We next tested the expression levels of b1-integrin and NFkB p65 by immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 5C). As seen in
the representative tissue sections, b1-integrin was reduced
in T4þJSH tumors and a severe reduction was observed in
tumors formed by T4þJSHþIR. Similarly, total and nuclear NFkB p65 were also reduced in T4þJSH and a further reduction
was observed in T4þJSHþIR tumors. Then, Western blot
analysis of tumor sections was conducted to further determine
the expression levels of b1-integrin and NF-kB. The Western

data also revealed a decrease in phospho and total b1-integrins
together with p65/p50 in NF-kB–inhibited T4-2 tumors, which
was further reduced by IR (Fig. 5D). The results of these
experiments show that NF-kB inhibition in T4-2 cells with or
without IR decreases the tumor growth via inhibition of b1integrin expression in athymic mice. Together with Figs. 2C–F,
the data in Fig. 5 strongly suggest that b1-integrin expression is
regulated by NF-kB.

that NF-kB is a downstream target of b1-integrin. Inhibition of
b1-integrin also signiﬁcantly reduced IR-induced NF-kB DNAbinding activity (Fig. 6B). Together with Figs. 1B and 2C and F,
these results suggest a loop-like b1-integrin–NF-kB–b1-integrin pathway is activated post-IR to induce radioresistance
in T4-2 cells in 3D lrECM (schematic presentation is shown
in Fig. 6C).

Inhibition of b1-integrin reversed IR-induced NF-kB
protein levels and DNA binding activity in 3D lrECM
The functional role of integrin-induced NF-kB in cell survival was ﬁrst showed by Scatena M and colleagues in a5b3integrin-mediated endothelial cells (33). To determine whether
b1-integrin function blocking monoclonal antibody AIIB2 was
able to inhibit IR-induced NF-kB p65/p50 expression and DNAbinding activity, immunoblotting for p65 and p50, and an
ELISA-based DNA-binding assay were conducted in T4-2 cells
in 3D lrECM. As shown in Fig. 6A, IR-induced p65/p50 protein
levels were signiﬁcantly reduced by 0.2 mg/mL AIIB2, suggesting

Cancer cells dynamically interact with their microenvironment to remodel the surrounding stroma and facilitate
growth and invasion. Tumor ECM has been shown to
increase resistance to cytotoxic cancer therapy including
radiation (6, 7) and has also been associated with poor
outcomes in subgroups of patients with breast cancer
(34). However, the underlying basis for ECM-mediated resistance to therapy, particularly after radiation, has not been
well studied. We have previously shown that targeting b1integrin leads to selective apoptosis and cytostasis in breast
cancer cells in vivo without toxicity. In addition, a number of

studies have shown that b1-integrins regulate radiationinduced prosurvival signaling, leading to increased survivability and reproductive capacity of human cancer cells
exposed to ionizing radiation (8, 9, 13, 14, 28). In
the present study, we wished to further dissect the possible
molecular mechanisms associated with b1-integrin regulation of survival in irradiated cancer cells. We discovered that
a typical NF-kB–binding site was located in the promoter
region of the b1-integrin gene (Fig. 1F). Given the known role
of NF-kB in mediating an acute phase stress response to IR,
we sought to further investigate a potential novel relationship between ECM-directed signaling and b1-integrin-mediated survival. Here, we show that NF-kB directly modiﬁes
b1-integrin expression, in part through transcriptional activation (Figs. 2D and F). This is associated with increased
survival post-IR, and sensitization of cells to IR-induced

death upon inhibition of NF-kB (Figs. 1B and 3C and D).
This pathway is functional in several breast cancer cell lines,
and notably oppositely regulated in normal human mammary epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Finally, inhibition of b1-integrin reverses NF-kB transcriptional activity
(Fig. 6B), suggesting a loop-like b1-integrin–NF-kB–b1integrin regulatory pathway in malignant, but not normal
cells.
b1-integrin signaling has been shown to mediate diverse
roles in cancer progression including invasion, migration, and
metastasis (35, 36). In addition, b1-integrins mediate resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation in several
human cancers (6–9). In addition, we have previously shown
that the combination of b1-integrin inhibitory antibodies with
IR signiﬁcantly reduced the dose that was necessary to achieve
the same growth inhibitory effect in breast cancer xenografts

in vivo, related to regulation of Akt signaling downstream of b1integrin (8, 13). Cordes and colleagues showed a FAK/cortactin-dependent regulation directly linked of b1-integrin-mediated survival post-IR in squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck (9). Thus, increasing evidence indicates that
inhibiting b1-integrins enhance the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
radiotherapy through critical signaling pathways. However,
modulation of gene expression is one of the most important
events because it directly controls cellular adaptation to
genotoxic conditions; yet little is known regarding the potential transcriptional mechanisms involved in the b1-integrindependent survival pathway of cancer cells after IR treatment.
Here, we show that IR induces p65 translocation into the
nucleus (Figs. 1C and D) and concomitantly increases NF-kB
binding to the b1-integrin promoter region (86 bp upstream of
transcription initiation site; Fig. 1E), suggesting that IRinduced NF-kB activity transcriptionally upregulates b1integrin.
To elucidate the functional consequences of this interaction, we measured therapeutic endpoints after inhibition of
NF-kB using JSH-23. We used a clonogenic assay to show
that reproductive capacity was signiﬁcantly reduced in JSH23-treated malignant breast cells after IR (Fig. 1B). In
addition, as we have previously shown that using 3D lrECM
accurately predicted response between normal and malignant cells in vivo, we tested JSH-23 in this context. As shown,
colony size and proliferation were dramatically reduced
while apoptosis was increased in T4-2, but not S1, cells,
consistent with the role of NF-kB in positively regulating b1integrin post-IR in malignant, but not nonmalignant breast
cells (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3). To determine the
broader applicability of our ﬁndings, we tested luminal-like
(MCF7) and basal-like (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell
lines for response to JSH-23 and IR. Interestingly, JSH-23
highly induced apoptosis and reduced proliferation in basallike breast cancers T4-2 and MDA-MB-231 compared with
luminal-like breast cancer MCF-7 cells (Figs. 3C–E and 4),
indicating that basal-like breast cancers may be more
responsive to b1-integrin/NF-kB–targeted therapies. Yamaguchi N and colleagues reported that basal-like breast
cancer cell lines that exhibited higher activation of NF-kB
than luminal subtypes are preferentially involved in proliferation (37). Together, these results are consistent with our
previous ﬁndings that b1-integrin levels are much higher in
basal compared with luminal cell lines, consistent with a
higher dependence on integrin-related prosurvival signaling
(8, 13, 28).
It has been well documented that the stress conditions
induced by radiation can activate a cellular defense system,
including NF-kB, the acute phase transcription factor that
affects the decision of cell fate after IR. NF-kB mediates the
survival response of many signals by inhibiting p53-dependent apoptosis and upregulating antiapoptotic members of
the Bcl-2 family, and caspase inhibitors such as XIAP and
FLIP (29, 38). In addition to antiapoptotic responses, NF-kB
regulates expression of the stress-responsive genes associated with a prosurvival network (39, 40). Inhibition of NF-kB
activity increases the intrinsic radiosensitivity in several

3746

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

(41, 42), but not all, human cancer cell lines (43). This
apparent paradox indicates that IR-induced NF-kB subunits
may cross-talk with other signaling elements and/or may
have distinct tissue-speciﬁcity. To further investigate the
relationship between b1-integrins and NF-kB, we provide
evidence for components of the regulatory network showing
that phosphorylation of T788/789 of the b1-integrin cytoplasmic tail were decreased by NF-kB inhibitors (JSH-23 and
IMD-0354), along with total b1-integrins and the active
components of the NF-kB p65/p50 subunits (Figs. 2C and
E and Supplementary Fig. S1A).
This study also shows interactions of b1-integrin with NF-kB
p65 and one of its heterodimeric partners a5-integrin. Protein–
protein interactions can have positive implications for cancer
prevention and therapy. The studies of Vassilev and colleagues
(44, 45) showed in vivo proof-of-principle that inhibitors of
protein–protein interactions can be efﬁcacious anticancer
drugs. NF-kB physically and/or functionally interacts with
many proteins, including MEK, E2F1 transcription factor, and
PML tumor suppressor, involved in the controlling of cell
proliferation and survival (23, 46, 47). In the present study, we
have shown that the interactions of b1-integrin with NF-kB p65
and a5-integrin were oppositely regulated in malignant breast
cancer T4-2 and its counterpart radiosensitive nonmalignant
breast epithelial S1 cells. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4,
b1-integrin/p65 protein complex signiﬁcantly increased postIR in S1, but not T4-2, cells, indicating that NF-kB may protect
S1 cells against radiation damage via physical interaction with
b1-integrin. Furthermore, IR-induced a5b1-integrin complex
was much higher in T4-2 than S1 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S4C), suggesting that the induction of b1-integrin interaction
with a5-integrin promotes radioresistance of malignant breast
cancer T4-2 cells.
Another important implication of the current results is
the loop-like activation pathway of NF-kB/b1-integrin signaling in breast cancer radioresistance. It is well documented that NF-kB is activated by radiation (23, 29), and NF-kB
is now shown to bind directly to the b1-integrin promoter,
resulting in b1-integrin overexpression and tumor radioresistance. In addition, several previous studies have correlated NF-kB activation with integrin ligation. The functional
role of integrin-induced NF-kB in cell survival was ﬁrst
shown by Scatena and colleagues (33). In Figs. 6A and B,
we showed that IR-induced NF-kB p65/p50 expression and
DNA binding activity were inhibited by b1-integrin function
blocking monoclonal antibody AIIB2. This feed-forward
loop-like b1-integrin–NF-kB–b1-integrin pathway activated
post-IR may cause tumor resistance. A schematic presentation of the b1-integrin–NF-kB–b1-integrin loop in radioresistance is proposed in Fig. 6C. We speculate that activation of this pathway results in the failure of DNA-damaging
anticancer modalities in breast cancers.
In summary, we report here a novel ﬁnding that b1integrin is induced by exposure to radiation through NFkB–mediated gene activation in 3D lrECM breast cancer cell
culture and breast cancer xenografts. NF-kB–mediated b1integrin overexpression is tightly associated with enhanced
clonogenic survival and tumor repopulation. Our results
