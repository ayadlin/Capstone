Abstract
There is a need for technologies to predict the efﬁcacy of cancer treatment in individual patients. Here, we show
that optical metabolic imaging of organoids derived from primary tumors can predict the therapeutic response of
xenografts and measure antitumor drug responses in human tumor–derived organoids. Optical metabolic
imaging quantiﬁes the ﬂuorescence intensity and lifetime of NADH and FAD, coenzymes of metabolism. As early
as 24 hours after treatment with clinically relevant anticancer drugs, the optical metabolic imaging index
of responsive organoids decreased (P < 0.001) and was further reduced when effective therapies were combined
(P < 5  106), with no change in drug-resistant organoids. Drug response in xenograft-derived organoids
was validated with tumor growth measurements in vivo and staining for proliferation and apoptosis. Heterogeneous cellular responses to drug treatment were also resolved in organoids. Optical metabolic imaging shows
potential as a high-throughput screen to test the efﬁcacy of a panel of drugs to select optimal drug combinations.

Introduction
With the ever-increasing number of drugs approved to treat
cancers, selection of the optimal treatment regimen for an
individual patient is challenging. Physicians weigh the potential beneﬁts of the drugs against the side-effects to the patient.
Currently, drug regimens for breast cancer are chosen on the
basis of tumor expression of several proteins, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and high levels of
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), assessed in
the diagnostic biopsy, and drug effectiveness is determined
after weeks of treatment from tumor size measurements. A
personalized medicine approach would identify the optimal
treatment regimen for an individual patient and reduce morbidity from overtreatment.
Current methods to assess therapy response include tumor
size, measured by mammography, MRI, or ultrasound. These
methods evaluate the regimen that the patient received.

Molecular changes induced by antitumor drugs precede
changes in tumor size and may provide proximal endpoints
of drug response. Cellular metabolism may provide biomarkers
of early treatment response, because oncogenic drivers typically affect metabolic signaling (1, 2). Indeed ﬂuoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)–PET has been explored as a predictor of
response but lacks the resolution and sensitivity to accurately
predict therapy response on a cellular level (3, 4).
Optical metabolic imaging (OMI) provides unique sensitivity
to detect metabolic changes that occur with cellular transformation (5–10) and upon treatment with anticancer drugs (11).
OMI uses the intrinsic ﬂuorescence properties of NADH and
FAD, coenzymes of metabolic reactions. OMI endpoints
include the optical redox ratio (the ﬂuorescence intensity of
NADH divided by the ﬂuorescence intensity of FAD), the NADH
and FAD ﬂuorescence lifetimes, and the "OMI index" (a linear
combination of these three endpoints). The optical redox ratio
provides a dynamic readout of cellular metabolism (12), with
increased redox ratio (NADH/FAD; ref. 8) observed in malignant cells exhibiting the Warburg effect (increased glycolysis
despite the presence of oxygen; ref. 13). Fluorescence lifetime
values report differences in ﬂuorophore conformation, binding, and microenvironment, such as pH, temperature, and
proximity to quenchers such as free oxygen (14). OMI endpoints report early, molecular changes due to anticancer drug
treatment (11), and are powerful biomarkers of drug response.
Primary tumors can be cultured ex vivo as organoids, which
contain the malignant tumor cells and the supporting cells
from the tumor environment, such as ﬁbroblasts, leukocytes,
endothelial cells, and hematopoietic cells (15). Interactions
between cancer cells and stromal cells have been shown to
mediate therapeutic resistance in tumors (16). Therefore,
organoid cultures provide an attractive platform to test cancer

Optical Imaging of Organoid Metabolism Predicts Drug Response

cell response to drugs in a relevant, "body-like" environment.
Furthermore, multiple organoids can be generated from one
biopsy, enabling high-throughput tests of multiple drug combinations with a small amount of tissue.
OMI of primary tumor organoids enables high-throughput
screening of potential drugs and drug combinations to identify
the most effective treatment for an individual patient. Here, we
validate OMI in primary tumor organoid cultures as an accurate, early predictor of in vivo tumor drug response in mouse
xenografts, and present the feasibility of this approach on
primary human tissues. The cellular resolution of this technique also allows for subpopulations of cells to be tracked over
time with treatment, to identify therapies that affect all cells in
a heterogeneous population.

Materials and Methods
Mouse xenografts
This study was approved by the Vanderbilt University
Animal Care and Use Committee and meets the NIH guidelines
for animal welfare. BT474 cells or HR6 cells (108) in 100 mL
Matrigel were injected in the inguinal mammary fat pads of
female athymic nude mice (J:NU; The Jackson Laboratory).
Tumors grew to 200 mm3. Tumor-bearing mice were treated
twice weekly with the following drugs: control human IgG (10
mg/kg, i.p.; R&D Systems), trastuzumab (10 mg/kg, i.p.; Vanderbilt Pharmacy), paclitaxel (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.; Vanderbilt Pharmacy), XL147 (10 mg/kg, oral gavage; Selleck Chemicals),
trastuzumab þ XL147, trastuzumab þ paclitaxel, and trastuzumab þ paclitaxel þ XL147. Tumor volume was calculated
from caliper measurements of tumor length (L) and width (W),
(L  W2)/2, twice a week.
Primary human tissue collection
This study was approved by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained
from all subjects. A primary tumor biopsy, removed from the
tumor mass after surgical resection, was provided by an expert
breast pathologist (M.E. Sanders). The tumor was placed immediately in sterile DMEM, transported on ice to the laboratory
(5-minute walk), and generated into organoids within 3
hours of tissue resection. Pathology and receptor status of
the tissue were obtained from the patient's medical chart.
Organoid generation and culture
Breast tumors (xenografts and primary) were washed
three times with PBS. Tumors were mechanically dissociated
into 100 to 300 mm macrosuspensions in 0.5 mL primary
mammary epithelial cell (PMEC) media [DMEM:F12 þ EGF
(10 ng/mL) þ hydrocortisone (5 mg/mL) þ insulin (5 mg/mL)
þ 1% penicillin:streptomycin] by cutting the tissues with a
scalpel or by spinning in a C-tube (Miltenyi Biotec). Macrosuspension solutions were combined with Matrigel in a 1:2
ratio, and 100 mL of the solution was placed on cover slips.
The gels solidiﬁed at room temperature for 30 minutes and
then for 1 hour in the incubator. The gels were over-lain
with PMEC media supplemented with drugs. The following
in vitro drug dosages were used to replicate in vivo doses

(17–19): control (control human IgG þ DMSO), trastuzumab
(25 mg/mL), paclitaxel (0.5 mmol/L), XL147 (25 nmol/L),
tamoxifen (2 mmol/L), fulvestrant (1 mmol/L), and A4
(10 mg/mL; Takis Biotech, Inc.).
Fluorescence lifetime instrumentation
Fluorescence lifetime imaging was performed on a custombuilt multiphoton microscope (Bruker), as described previously (11, 20). Excitation and emission light were coupled
through a 40 oil immersion objective (1.3 NA) within an
inverted microscope (Nikon; TiE). A titanium:sapphire laser
(Coherent Inc.) was tuned to 750 nm for NADH excitation
(average power, 7.5–7.9 mW) and 890 nm for FAD excitation
(average power, 8.4–8.6 mW). Bandpass ﬁlters, 440/80 nm for
NADH and 550/100 nm for FAD, isolated emission light. A pixel
dwell time of 4.8 microseconds was used to acquire 256  256
pixel images. Each ﬂuorescence lifetime image was collected
using time-correlated single-photon counting electronics
(SPC-150; Becker and Hickl) and a GaAsP PMT (H7422P-40;
Hamamatsu). Photon count rates were maintained above 5 
105 for the entire 60-second image acquisition time, ensuring
that no photobleaching occurred. The instrument response full
width at half maximum was 260 picoseconds as measured from
the second harmonic generation of a urea crystal. Daily ﬂuorescence lifetime validation was conﬁrmed by imaging of a
ﬂuorescent bead (Polysciences Inc). The measured lifetime of
the bead (2.1  0.06 nanoseconds) concurs with published
values (10, 20, 21).
Organoid imaging
Fluorescence lifetime images of organoids were acquired at
24, 48, and 72 hours after drug treatment. Organoids were
grown in 35-mm glass-bottom Petri dishes (MatTek Corp) and
imaged directly through the coverslip on the bottom of the
Petri dish. Six representative organoids from each treatment
group were imaged. The six organoids imaged contained
collectively approximately 60 to 300 cells per treatment group
for statistical and subpopulation analyses. First, an NADH
image was acquired and a subsequent FAD image was acquired
of the exact same ﬁeld of view.
Immunoﬂuorescence
A previously reported protocol (22) was adapted for immunoﬂuorescent staining of organoids. Brieﬂy, gels were washed
with PBS and ﬁxed with 2 mL 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
Gels were washed with PBS, and then 0.15 mol/L glycine in PBS
was added for 10 minutes. Gels were washed in PBS, and then
added to 0.02% Triton X-100 in PBS. Gels were washed with PBS
then overlain with 1% fatty acid–free BSA, 1% donkey serum in
PBS. The next day, the solution was removed and 100 mL of
antibody solution (diluted antibody in PBS with 1% donkey
serum) was added to each gel. The gels were incubated for 30
minutes at room temperature, washed in PBS three times, and
then incubated in 100 mL of secondary antibody solution for 30
minutes at room temperature. The gels were washed in PBS
three times, washed in water twice, and then mounted on slides
using 30 mL of the ProLong Antifade Solution (Molecular
Probes).

Walsh et al.

The primary antibodies used were anti-cleaved caspase-3
(Life Technologies) and anti-Ki67 (Life Technologies). Both
were diluted at 1:100. A goat anti-rabbit IgG FITC secondary
antibody was used (Life Technologies). FITC ﬂuorescence was
obtained by excitation at 980 nm on the multiphoton microscope described above, and a minimum of six organoids were
imaged. Positive staining of cleaved caspase-3 and Ki67 was
conﬁrmed by staining mouse thymus and mouse small intestine, respectively. Immunoﬂuorescence images were quantiﬁed by manual counting of the total number of cells and the
number of positively stained cells in each ﬁeld of view. Immunoﬂuorescence results were presented as percentage of positively stained cells, quantiﬁed from six organoids, approximately 200 cells.
Generation of OMI endpoint images
Photon counts for nine surrounding pixels were binned
(SPCImage). Fluorescence lifetime components were extracted
from the photon decay curves by deconvolving the measured
system response and ﬁtting the decay to a two-component
model, IðtÞ ¼ a1 expt=t1 þ a2 expt=t2 þ C, where I(t) is the
ﬂuorescence intensity at time t after the laser pulse, a1 and a2
are the fractional contributions of the short and long lifetime
components, (i.e., a1 þ a2 ¼ 1), t 1 and t 2 are the ﬂuorescence
lifetimes of the short and long lifetime components, and C
accounts for background light. A two-component decay was
used to represent the lifetimes of the free and bound conﬁgurations of NADH and FAD (10, 23, 24) and yielded the lowest
x2 values (0.99–1.1), indicative of an optimal ﬁt. Matrices of the
lifetime components were exported as ascii ﬁles for further
processing in Matlab.
Automated image analysis software
To streamline the cellular-level processing of organoid
images, an automated image analysis routine, as previously
described (25), was used in Cell Proﬁler in Matlab. Brieﬂy, a
customized threshold code identiﬁed pixels belonging to
nuclear regions that were brighter than background but not
as bright as cell cytoplasms. These nuclear pixels were
smoothed and the resulting round objects between 6 and 25
pixels in diameter were segmented and saved as the nuclei
within the image. Cells were identiﬁed by propagating out from
the nuclei. An Otsu Global threshold was used to improve
propagation and prevent propagation into background pixels.
Cell cytoplasms were deﬁned as the cells minus the nuclei.
Cytoplasm values were measured from each OMI image (redox
ratio, NADH t m, NADH t 1, NADH t 2, NADH a1, FAD t m, FAD t 1,
FAD t 2, and FAD a1).
Computation of OMI index
The redox ratio, NADH t m, and FAD t m were norm-centered
across cell values from all treatment groups within a sample,
resulting in unitless parameters with a mean of 1. The OMI
index is the linear combination of the norm-centered redox
ratio, NADH t m, and FAD t m, with the coefﬁcients (1, 1, and
1), respectively, computed for each cell. The three endpoints,
redox ratio, NADH t m, and FAD t m are independent variables
(11) and are thus weighted equally. The signs of the coefﬁcients

5186

were chosen to maximize difference between control and drugresponding cells.
Subpopulation analysis
Subpopulation analysis was performed by generating histograms of all cell values within a group as previously reported
(11). Each histogram was ﬁt to 1, 2, and 3 component Gaussian
curves. The lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) signiﬁed
the best ﬁtting probability density function for the histogram
(26). Probability density functions were normalized to have an
area under the curve equal to 1.
Statistical tests
Differences in OMI endpoints between treatment groups
were tested using a student t test with a Bonferroni correction.
An a signiﬁcance level less than 0.05 was used for all statistical
tests.

Results
Response of BT474 organoids to a panel of anticancer
drugs
Validation of an organoid-OMI screen for drug response was
ﬁrst tested in two isogenic HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer
xenografts. BT474 xenografts are sensitive to the HER2 antibody trastuzumab, whereas HR6 xenografts, derived as a
subline of BT474, are trastuzumab resistant. The following
single drugs and drug combinations were tested: paclitaxel
(P; chemotherapy), trastuzumab (H; anti-HER2 antibody),
XL147 (X; PI3K small-molecule inhibitor; ref. 27), HþP, HþX,
and HþPþX. Paclitaxel and trastuzumab are standard-of-care
drugs, and XL147 is in clinical trials and preclinical studies
support combination therapy of XL147 with trastuzumab
for patients who have developed a resistance to trastuzumab
(27, 28).
Representative redox ratio, NADH t m, and FAD t m images
of BT474 xenograft-derived organoids demonstrate mixed
multicellular morphology and highlight the subcellular resolution of this technique (Fig. 1A–F). A longitudinal study of
tumor growth demonstrated that the BT474 xenografts
responded to each treatment arm (Fig. 1G), with signiﬁcant
reduction in tumor volume, as determined from caliper
measurements, on day 7 for all treatment groups except
trastuzumab, which had signiﬁcant reduction on day 11
(Fig. 1H).
A composite endpoint, the OMI index, was computed as a
linear combination of the mean-normalized optical redox
ratio, NADH t m, and FAD t m for each cell. After 24 hours of
treatment, the OMI index was signiﬁcantly reduced in all
treated BT474 organoids, compared with the control (P <
0.05; Fig. 1I). By 72 hours, the OMI index decreased further in
all the treatment groups (P < 5  107, Fig. 1J). The redox ratio,
NADH t m, and FAD t m values showed similar trends (Supplementary Fig. S1). Changes in short and long lifetime values and
in the portion of free NADH or FAD contributed to the changes
in t m (Supplementary Table S1).
The high-resolution capabilities of OMI allowed single-cell
analysis and population modeling for quantiﬁcation of

cellular subpopulations with varying OMI indices. Visual
inspection of cell morphology suggested that the majority
of cells are tumor epithelial cells; stromal cells with obvious
morphologic differences were eliminated from the analysis.
Population density modeling of cellular distributions of the
OMI index revealed two populations with high and low OMI
index values in all of the BT474-treated organoids at 24
hours (Fig. 1K and Supplementary Fig. S2). By 72 hours, the
XL147-, HþP-, HþX-, and HþPþX-treated organoids have a
single population with narrower peaks (Fig. 1L and Supplementary Fig. S2). The trastuzumab-treated organoids have
two populations at 72 hours, both lower than the mean OMI
index of the control organoids (Fig. 1L). Immunoﬂuorescent
staining of cleaved caspase-3 and Ki67 of BT474 organoids
treated for 72 hours conﬁrmed increased apoptosis and
decreased proliferation in drug-treated organoids, with the
greatest increases in cell death with combined treatments
(Fig. 1M and N).

Response of HR6 organoids to a panel of anticancer
drugs
Next, the OMI-organoid screen was tested on trastuzumabresistant HR6 xenografts (29). Representative images show
HR6 organoid morphology and spatial distributions of OMI
endpoints (Fig. 2A–F). These HER2-overexpressing tumors had
continued growth with trastuzumab treatment (Fig. 2G).
Treatment with paclitaxel and XL147 initially caused HR6
tumor regression (P < 0.05 on day 10 for XL147 and on day
14 for paclitaxel) but then resumed growth (Fig. 2G and H).
Mice treated with the HþP, HþX, and HþPþX combination
therapies exhibited sustained HR6 tumor reduction (Fig. 2G
and H).
After 24 hours of treatment, signiﬁcant reductions in the
OMI index were detected in HR6 organoids treated with
paclitaxel, XL147, HþP, HþX, and HþPþX (P < 0.05; Fig. 2I).
At 72 hours, the OMI index of the paclitaxel- and XL147treated organoids was signiﬁcantly greater than that of the

OMI endpoints identify breast cancer subtypes
We tested these methods on primary breast cancer biopsies
obtained from surgical resection. Tumors were obtained fresh
from deidentiﬁed mastectomy specimens not required for
further diagnostic purposes, and dissociated into organoids
within 1 to 3 hours postresection. Cancer drugs were added
and organoids were imaged with OMI. Representative redox
ratio, NADH t m, and FAD t m images (Fig. 3) demonstrate the
varying morphology of organoids derived from ERþ, HER2þ,
and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC).
When quantiﬁed, the OMI endpoints differed between cancer subtypes. In immortalized cell lines, the redox ratio was
elevated in ERþ/HER2 cells and was greatest in HER2þ cells
(P < 5  105, Fig. 4A). Similarly, NADH t m was increased
in immortalized ERþ/HER2 and HER2þ breast cancer cells
as compared with TNBC cells (P < 5  108, Fig. 4B). FAD t m
was greatest in ERþ/HER2 cells (P < 0.05, Fig. 4C). Overall,
the OMI index was lowest in TNBC and greatest in HER2þ

Organoid response of ERþ primary human tumors
Organoids were generated from four ERþ (HER2) primary
human tumors and treated with the chemotherapeutic drug
paclitaxel, the selective ER modulator tamoxifen, the HER2
antibody trastuzumab, and the pan-PI3K inhibitor XL147.
Organoids derived from the ﬁrst ERþ tumor had signiﬁcantly
reduced OMI index values upon treatment with paclitaxel,
tamoxifen, XL147, HþX, HþPþT, HþPþX, and HþPþTþX for
72 hours (P < 5  105, Fig. 5A). Immunoﬂuorescence of
cleaved caspase-3 showed increased cell death in parallel

Discussion

Organoid Response of HERþ and TNBC primary human
tumors
OMI was also performed on organoids derived from HER2þ
(ER) and TNBC specimens. Organoids derived from the
HER2þ primary tumor were treated with the ER downregulator
fulvestrant, the HER2 antibody trastuzumab, and the antiErbB3 antibody A4 (30). The OMI index was signiﬁcantly
decreased in the organoids treated for 24 hours with trastuzumab and A4 (P < 0.005, Fig. 6A). Subpopulation analysis
revealed shifts in the mean OMI index values with these
treatments within a single population of cells (Fig. 6B). Organoids derived from the TNBC specimen were treated with
tamoxifen, the HER2 antibody trastuzumab, and the combination of trastuzumab plus tamoxifen (HþT). No signiﬁcant
changes were observed with these treatments in TNBC organoids after 24 hours (P > 0.3, Fig. 6C). Subpopulation analysis

Primary tumor organoids are an attractive platform for drug
screening because they are grown from intact biopsies, thus
maintaining the tumor cells within the same tumor microenvironment (15). OMI is sensitive to early metabolic changes,
achieves high resolution to allow analysis of tumor cell heterogeneity, and uses endogenous contrast in living cells for
repeated measurements and longitudinal studies (11). The
OMI index is a holistic reporter of cellular metabolism because
the redox ratio and NADH and FAD lifetimes are independent
measurements (11). The mean lifetime captures not only
changes in free-to-bound protein ratios but also preferred
protein binding and relative concentrations of NADH to
NADPH (31). Cancer drugs have been shown to downregulate
certain metabolism enzymes; for example, trastuzumab downregulates lactate dehydrogenase in breast cancer, and paclitaxel-resistant cells have been shown to have more lactate
dehydrogenase expression and activity (32). The OMI index
captures these drug-induced changes in metabolism enzyme
activity. Organoids remain viable with stable OMI endpoints in
controlled culture conditions (33), thus making them an
attractive system to evaluate tumor response to drugs. We
used OMI to assess the response of primary breast tumor
organoids to a panel of clinically relevant anticancer agents
used singly or in combination. Early OMI-measured response
in organoids (24–72 hours after treatment) corroborated with

standard tumor growth curves in xenografts, and the feasibility
of this approach was conﬁrmed in organoids derived from
primary human breast tumors.
The OMI index was ﬁrst evaluated as a reporter of tumor
response in organoids derived from BT474 (ERþ/HER2þ)
xenografts. Signiﬁcant reductions in OMI index upon treatment with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, XL147, and combinations
thereof, at both 24 and 72 hours, correlated with reduction of
tumor growth (Fig. 1). Biochemically, cellular rates of glycolysis, and NADH and FAD protein-binding decrease with drug
treatment in responsive cells (32), resulting in decreased redox
ratios and NADH t m, and increased FAD t m in agreement with
the decreased OMI index observed in drug-treated BT474
organoids. Signiﬁcant reductions in tumor growth occurred
7 to 11 days after treatment initiation, whereas the OMI index
detected response 24 to 72 hours after treatment. Cellular
analysis revealed an initial heterogeneous response among
cells within organoids treated with paclitaxel and HþP at 24
hours, which, by 72 hours, became a uniform response. The
heterogeneity of trastuzumab-treated BT474 organoids persisted over 72 hours, suggesting an intrinsic subpopulation
more susceptible to acquire drug resistance. This heterogeneity was not seen in the combination treatments, suggesting the
combination treatments trump this drug resistance–prone
subpopulation. OMI-measured response corroborated with
increased cell death and decreased proliferation due to single
and combination drug–treated organoids, measured with
destructive postmortem techniques. The XL147-treated BT474
organoids have a much lower OMI index at 72 hours, but only a
modest increase in cleaved caspase-3 activity. The same
decrease was not observed in the HR6 cells that have alternative metabolism pathways activated because of their acquired
resistance to trastuzumab. The OMI index detects changes in
cellular metabolism that predict drug efﬁcacy, but do not
necessarily correlate with IHC.
In the current standard of care, patients with innate drug
resistance are not identiﬁed a priori. We tested the capabilities
of OMI to predict drug resistance using trastuzumab-resistant
HR6 (ERþ/HER2þ) tumors (29). XL147 is a novel PI3K inhibitor
under investigation for combined therapy with trastuzumab to
improve response of resistant tumors (27). Signiﬁcant reductions in the OMI index of HR6 organoids treated for 72 hours
identiﬁed drug combinations (HþX, HþP, and HþPþX) that
induced a sustained reduction in tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 2).
The reduction in tumor growth upon treatment with HþX was
consistent with previous reports of greater antitumor effects of
the combination over trastuzumab and XL147 alone (27).
Subpopulation analysis revealed multiple responses within the
HR6 organoids after treatment with single drugs and combinations, suggesting increased heterogeneity compared with
the parental BT474 organoids.
The OMI index of paclitaxel- and XL147-treated HR6 organoids initially decreased at 24 hours, and then increased at 72
hours, mirroring the tumor growth in mice after prolonged
therapy, and indicating that the adaptations that allow HR6
cells to survive trastuzumab treatment also affect response to
additional drugs. This relapse of HR6 tumors treated with
paclitaxel and XL147 was not apparent until 2 to 3 weeks of

5192

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

drug treatment; yet, the OMI index identiﬁed a resistant
population within both paclitaxel- and XL147-treated organoids at 24 hours and showed a selection of this population by
72 hours. Subpopulation analysis of the paclitaxel- and XL147treated HR6 organoids revealed heterogeneous responses at 24
hours, suggesting that OMI is capable of early detection of
resistant cells within a heterogeneous tumor. These results
indicate that OMI of primary tumor organoids is able to
identify heterogeneous responses within tumors on a cellular
level, and potentially guide therapy selection early for maximal
response. The ability to detect innate resistance at a cellular
level before treatment may provide leads for identiﬁcation of
drugs that target such refractory subpopulations before they
are selected by the primary therapy.
We next examined the feasibility of this approach using fresh
tumor biopsies obtained from primary tumor surgical resections. OMI measurements in vivo and corresponding measurements from freshly excised tissues within 8 hours of surgery are
statistically identical (20), providing ample time for specimen
acquisition and transport to the laboratory. The morphology of
organoids differed among patients and within breast cancer
subtypes (Fig. 3), demonstrating a greater heterogeneity within
primary tumors compared with xenografts.
Previously published studies report differences in OMI
endpoints due to the presence or absence of ER and HER2
(8, 11, 34). Both ER and HER2 signaling pathways can inﬂuence metabolism: ER by inducing increased glucose transport
(1), and HER2 through activation of PI3K (2), among other
signal transducers. We compared OMI endpoints from
immortalized cells and human tissue-derived organoids of
three subtypes of breast cancer: ERþ, HER2-overexpressing,
and TNBC. The OMI index of immortalized cell lines increased
with ER expression and was highest in HER2 overexpressing
cells (consistent with prior studies (11)), and these trends
were replicated in organoids derived from primary human
tumors. Notably, NADH t m was signiﬁcantly increased (P <
0.05) in the HER2þ organoids compared with ERþ organoids,
but this trend was not observed in the immortalized cell lines.
This difference could be due to molecular changes induced by
the immortalization process, media components, primary
tumor heterogeneity, and/or the heterogeneity within a primary breast tumor. Regardless, the results shown (Fig. 4)
suggest breast cancer subtypes, ERþ, HER2þ and TNBC, have
different OMI proﬁles.
Organoids derived from human breast tumors were treated
with a panel of breast cancer drugs (Figs. 5 and 6). Differences
in the drug response of these organoids suggest heterogeneity
across ERþ/HER tumors. Organoids from one of the four ERþ
tumors did not exhibit reduced OMI indices after treatment
with tamoxifen. Organoids derived from two of the four ERþ
samples did not have reduced OMI indices after paclitaxel
treatment. These variable responses are consistent with variable responses seen with these drugs in the clinic (35–38).
None of the organoids had reduced OMI indices with trastuzumab, which is expected because the organoids were derived
from HER2 tumors. Generally, the OMI index was reduced
further upon treatment with drug combinations, supporting
the use of drug combinations clinically.

Optical Imaging of Organoid Metabolism Predicts Drug Response

Subpopulation analysis revealed cells within organoid treatment groups that exhibit different OMI indices after treatment,
suggesting that subpopulations of cells with different drug
sensitivities preexist and develop within primary tumors. Some
of these cells may represent the cancer stem-like population
with increased renewal capacity, metastatic potential, and
drug resistance (39). The populations of organoids derived
from human tumors have more variability (broader population
curves) than those derived from xenografts, reﬂecting an
inherent greater heterogeneity within primary tumors. This
corroborates previous reports (40) of greater intratumoral
heterogeneity in primary tumors than in xenografts derived
from clonal cell lines. Thus, OMI imaging allows identiﬁcation
of heterogeneous cellular response to drug treatment in a
dynamic population, which potentially enables drug selection
to maximize therapeutic efﬁcacy.
Organoids derived from HER2þ/ER and TNBC primary
tumors have OMI responses consistent with their clinical
characteristics: reduced OMI index with trastuzumab treatment and no change with fulvestrant (ER antagonist) treatment in the HER2þ/ER organoids (41), and no OMI index
reductions after treatment with trastuzumab or tamoxifen in
the TNBC organoids (Fig. 6a and c; refs. 42, 43). HER3 is an
emerging target for breast cancer (30, 44) and the anti-HER3
antibody A4 reduced the OMI index of HER2þ/ER organoids.
The results of this study support the validity of OMI for
monitoring organoid response to anticancer drugs. We demonstrate high selectivity of the OMI index to directly measure
drug response of organoids derived from breast cancer xenografts to single anticancer drugs and their combinations, and
validated OMI measured response with gold standard tumor
growth in two xenograft models. We have shown that the OMI
index measured in primary tumor organoids resolves response
and nonresponse within 72 hours, compared with the 3 weeks
required to resolve this response with tumor size measurements. Furthermore, we extend this approach and generate
drug response information from organoids derived from three

subtypes of primary human tumors, TNBC, ERþ, and HER2þ.
The high resolution of OMI allows subpopulation analysis for
identiﬁcation of heterogeneous tumor response to drugs in
dynamic tumor cell populations. Altogether, these results
suggest that OMI of primary tumor organoids may be a
powerful test to predict the action of anticancer drugs and
tailor treatment decisions accordingly.
