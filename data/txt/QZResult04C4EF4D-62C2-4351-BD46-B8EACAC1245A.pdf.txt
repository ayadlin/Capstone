ABSTRACT
Proton coupled oligopeptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) is a member of the peptide
transporter superfamily and plays important role in the absorption of oligopeptide
and peptidomimetic drugs. Our previous research verified that PEPT1 expressed
specifically in human Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and cell lines and showed
potential transport activity to be a new candidate of the tumor therapeutic target.
In this study, we aim to explore the feasibility of a novel tumor target therapeutic
strategy: Targeting PEPT1 to improve the antitumor efficacy of Doxorubicin in human
HCC therapy. First, Doxorubicin was conjugated with Glycylglycylglycine (Gly-Gly-Gly)
− a tripeptide which was known as the substrate of PEPT1 and characterized by HPLC
and MS successfully. Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate was then observed to clarify
the target delivery by PEPT1 and the antitumor effect on human hepatocarcinoma
in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the improvement of the toxic and side effect of
Doxorubicin after conjugation was also evaluated by some biochemical tests. Our
results reveal that targeting PEPT1 may contribute to the efficient delivery of
Doxorubicin to hepatocarcinoma cells and the reduction of drug toxicity. PEPT1 has
the prospect to be a novel target of HCC therapy.

INTRODUCTION

side effects occurred during and after HCC treatment.
These toxicities usually affect heart, brain, bone marrow
and the consequences of these toxicities are often very
apparent and will lasted for many years after treatment
[2]. Therefore it is urgent to explore the new therapeutic
strategy to improve the efficacy of the antitumor agents.
In recent researches, Target therapy has become a
potent therapeutic strategy for tumor which delivered the
antitumor drug to the lesion directly and accurately and
has the advantage of less toxicity to the normal tissues.
Therefore some antitumor targets such as nanoparticle,
tumor specific antigen, tumor specific receptor are under
investigating and play key role in tumor target therapy
strategy [3, 4]. PEPT1 is one of the four members of
peptide transporter super family in mammalian cells,

HCC is one of the most common malignant tumors
worldwide. China has the high morbidity and mortality
of HCC and the number of the HCC patients in China
account for 54% of the world [1]. Due to the occult onset
and difficult to early diagnosis, most of the HCC patients
missed the optimal operating timing. Thus, non-operative
therapy including chemotherapy is an important treatment
strategy for advanced HCC. But the chemotherapeutic
agents are relatively ineffective and result in many
serious toxic and side effects. Doxorubicin is a traditional
chemotherapeutic agent for a wide variety of cancers.
Despite of being highly effective, the use of Doxorubicin
has many limitations due to the significant toxicity and

Synthesis and identification of Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate

which is expressed predominantly in intestine and is now
recognized as the major route by which dietary nutrients
(di/tripeptide) or peptidomimetic drugs were absorbed
[5]. Because of the capacity of PEPT1 to transport a broad
spectrum of substrates, it has made an attractive target for
drug delivery. Despite of intestine expression, PEPT1 also
be found in some carcinomas such as pancreatic carcinoma,
prostate cancer, gastric cancer et al [6, 7]. Our recent study
also verified that PEPT1 can be specific expressed in
human hepatocarcinoma tissue and cell lines and has the
transport activity to mediate the delivery of oligopeptide
or peptidomimetic molecules. Therefore we speculate that
PEPT1 has the prospect to be a promising target for tumor
target therapy. Those reports involving in PEPT1 mostly
concentrate on the molecular expression and functional
activity investigation but few focus on the application
of PEPT1 in tumor target therapy. The feasibility and
effect of utilizing PEPT1to specific deliver the antitumor
chemotherapy agents to the target cancer cells and reducing
the side effect on the normal site was fewer reported.
In this study, we aim to explore the feasibility of
a novel tumor target therapeutic strategy: Targeting
PEPT1 to improve the antitumor efficacy of Doxorubicin
in human HCC therapy. We conjugate Doxorubicin with
a tripeptide ligand − Gly-Gly-Gly which is a known
substrate of PEPT1 to make it be recognized by PEPT1
and transported into the HCC cells. Then we investigated
the antitumor effect of Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate
on HCC in vitro and in vivo and observed the improvement
of the side effects. According to our study we speculate
that targeting PEPT1 may be a new and efficient strategy
to improve the antitumor effect and overcome the drug
side effect of Doxorubicin on HCC therapy. PEPT1 has the
prospect to be a novel target of HCC therapy.

Doxorubicin was successfully conjugated with a
tripeptide Gly-Gly-Gly, which is a substrate of PEPT1.
Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate was purified and
identified by HPLC and MS. The purity of Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate is 98.00%. The structure and HPLC
chart were as shown below (Figure 2A and 2B).

Inhibitory effect of doxorubicin-tripeptide
conjugate on HCC cells by MTT
The IC50 of Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate
was 0.05 mg/ml detected by MTT. The inhibition effect
of Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate have showed
dose independent. According to the dose equivalent
principle of Doxorubicin and the results of MTT, the
drug concentration chosen in vitro cell experiment
was Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate 0.05 mg/ml and
Doxorubicin 0.01 mg/ml (Table 1).

The observation of doxorubicin-tripeptide
conjugate uptake by HCC cells under
fluorescence microscope
Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate and Doxorubicin
can emit red fluorescence. Based on the above findings,
we confirmed that these two drugs can be transported into
HCC cells as well as Caco-2 cells at the periphery of the
nucleus with red fluorescence aggregation, and the longer
the action time, the stronger the fluorescence density and
strength. Compared with Doxorubicin, in the same drug
action time, the Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate had a
more significant effect (Figure 2C).

RESULTS

The concentration analysis of Doxorubicin in
HCC by HPLC

The molecular expression and transport activity
of PEPT1 in HCC

The chromatographic peak was located in 16.5 min
of Doxorubicin and 8.7 min of Doxorubicin-tripeptide
conjugate. The regression equation of Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate was as bellow: y = 4016.x–48.16
(linearity range 0.051~10.2 ug.ml–1, R² = 0.999), while the
regression equation of Doxorubicin revealed as follows:
y = 2522.x + 16.31(linearity range 0.0495~9.9 ug.ml-1,
R² = 0.999). The following table showed the concentration
of these two drugs in Bel-7402, HepG2 and Caco2 cells
measured by HPLC, which presented that Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate had a higher drug concentration
(Figure 3, Table 2).

Our study reveals that the protein and mRNA
expression of PEPT1 were higher in HCC cells Bel-7402
and HepG2, as well as in Caco-2 cells, compared with
normal liver cell line HL-7702, according to Western
blotting and real-time RT-PCR (Figure 1A and 1B). The
protein expression of PEPT1 in HCC tissues was higher
than that observed in adjacent tissues and normal liver
tissues (P = 0.0193 and P = 0.0057, respectively), which
was detected in our former work with a total of 82 cases
of human HCC tissue (Figure 1C). Additionally, PEPT1
expressed in HCC cells shows the oligopeptide transport
activity. The uptake of Ala-Lys-AMCA, a classic substrate
of PEPT1 was time-dependent and concentrationdependent and shows competitive inhibition by three
known substrates of PEPT1 in Bel-7402, HepG2 and
Caco-2 cells (Figure 1D).

Survival quality
The following observations were made regarding
the general condition of group A mice: Mice showed
slow activity, flagging spirit, loose and dull skin,
decreased appetite, varying degrees of weight loss with
the development of observation period. Group B appeared
lethargy, vomiting and loss of appetite administered
within 3 days, then gradually restored, but with continued
treatment resulted in low spirits, little food intake and
cachexia significantly. The survival quality of group C of
mice was the best. Some mice appear to have an increased
body weight and food intake. The above was more
significant in high dose administration.

Survival time

The Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate can inhibit the
growth of tumor. The tumor inhibition rates were 40.33%,
42.13% respectively comparing with the tumor inhibition
rates of Doxorubicin 32.35% and 25.28% in the high dose
group and low dose group. The subcutaneous tumors
were dissected and weighed at the end of therapy, and the
weight from high to low was the Control group (group A),
the Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate group (Group C)
and Doxorubicin group (group B). As the Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate dose increasing, the inhibition rate of
it on HCC will increase (Figure 5C and 5D, Table 3).

There was no difference in mice weight among three
groups before treatment. After administrated, all group
appeared different degrees of weight loss, among which
group C were the most significant. There was a weight
increase in group B at the early stage of treatment, but a
weight decreased significantly at the late stage of treatment.
Additionally, the dosage increased the above changes were
more obvious (Figure 5B, Table 3).

Drug inhibition rate

In the low dose group (HepG2), the mice in group
B had no death during the treatment of 5W, while group
C with 3 deaths and 1 death respectively in the treatment
of 3W+ and 4W+, group A with 3 deaths in the treatment
of 4W+. The survival time was 29~35 d (median 32d) in
group A, 23~30 d (median 26.5 d) in group C and 35 d
(median 35 d) in group B. The survival time of group B
was 8.57% (3.0 d) longer than that of the group A and

drug dosage was increased, the Doxorubicin-tripeptide
conjugate had more effective in cancer treatment with
fewer side effects, while the tumor inhibition rate of
the Doxorubicin was improved but associated with drug
toxicity increased (Figure 6B and 6C, Table 4, Table 5).

PEPT1 was further verified. It was found that there were
more positive particles in the tumor tissues and partly liver
tissues while less expression of the positive particles in the
heart and jejunum tissues (Figure 6D).

also has the high incidence of HCC [11]. The preferred
treatment for HCC is liver resection, but this treatment
is restricted to the very early stages of HCC [12]. Due to
the difficulty associated with early diagnosis, the rapid
progression of the disease and the fact that the majority
of patients have liver cirrhosis, few patients are able to
undergo the operation, resulting in the majority of patients
having a poor prognosis [13]. Thus, non-operative therapy
is an important treatment strategy for advanced HCC
[14, 15]. However, chemotherapy drugs are not specific to
liver cancer cells, they may also affect normal cells and may
result in serious adverse effects. Therefore, the currently
available therapies offer limited benefits to patients. As a
result, there is an urgent need for the development of novel,
better therapeutic strategies. A targeted drug delivery
system that can be used as an effective specific treatment
may have good application prospects [16]. In particular,
this system has many advantages. For example, the drug
can be specifically transported to the specific location of
a tumor and may achieve directional and focal inhibition
of tumor cells as well as also causing less injury to normal
cells, which may promote the highest treatment effects
with minimal toxic effects on normal cells, resulting in
increases in overall efficacy and safety as well as in patient
compliance with chemotherapy [17]. The search for a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

safe and effective targeted drug carrier is the focus of
ongoing research.
Drug carrier must meet the following conditions:
firstly, the drug can be specific identified and transported
through it. Secondly, it should have targeted performance,
which means deliver drug to specific site combined with
specific cell and ensuring the drug release. The targeting
drug carrier studied widely nowadays include liposomes,
nano materials, polymer materials, monoclonal antibodies,
peptide etc [18]. Nano material carrier has certain
adsorption and drug loading for some small molecule
and peptide drugs with a quickly and sufficient targeted
transport, but at the same time it can be adsorbed easily
by normal tissue which resulted in certain poisonous
effect [19]. Liposomes and polymer materials as targeted
carriers may have targeted and specific defects [20].
Monoclonal antibody carrier accompany with a high cost
and complicated process. What’s more, the targeting effect
of other carriers is not clear yet[21,22,23].
Professor AV Schally, a Nobel Prize winner at the
Tulane University School of medicine, proposed the use
of peptide as a carrier for targeted-therapy to delivery
drug specific and relatively purposeful [24, 25]. A great
deal of studies had found that some peptides existed in
human’s body, which highly expressed in tumor cells

and tissues, while little in normal cells and tissues. The
difference of peptide expression would be the promising
approach for drug targeting therapy by peptide as carrier.
More importantly, these peptides had no immunogenicity,
which can be metabolized and cleared by human body
with no harm [26].
In our previous study, we have proved that PEPT1
was highly expressed in HCC cells but relatively limited
expressed in normal liver tissues. The specific expression
of PEPT1 in HCC cells and tissues had been confirmed by
Western blot, Real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry
in HCC. It is generally recognized that Ala-Lys-AMCA is

a well-known PEPT1 substrate [27] and Caco-2 is an ideal
model for studying the structure and function of PEPT1
[28]. We also verified that PEPT1 which expressed in HCC
has the characteristic of oligopeptide transport activity
through the results of D-Ala-Lys-AMCA uptake test in
model cell Caco2 and HCC cells. Figure 1 showed some
representative data and images, comprehensive results
have been reported in another paper. Basing on the above
findings, we speculate PEPT1 can be used as a carrier of
HCC targeted chemotherapy. In this study we focus on
exploring the feasibility of targeting PEPT1 to improve the
antitumor efficacy of Doxorubicin in human HCC therapy.

The PEPT1 molecule recognizes a wide range of
substrates with a certain structural features [29], such
as di/tripeptide and their analogues [30]. In order to let
Doxorubicin can be delivered by PEPT1, Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate was synthesized with Doxorubicin
and a tripeptides − Gly-Gly-Gly which contained the

structure of recognized and combined by PEPT1 [31]. The
conjugate was successfully synthesized and identified with
the purity of 98%.
We found that Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate
can be transported into liver cancer cells as well as Caco2 cells based on the emission of red fluorescence, and

the longer the action time, the stronger the number and
intensity of red fluorescence. Compared with Doxorubicin,
Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate was more likely to enter
the liver cancer cells with a strong fluorescence intensity
under fluorescence microscopy and a high concentration
by HPLC. These results suggested that the Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate can achieve a good uptake and
absorption of the drug, of course through the PEPT1 carrier.
The effectiveness of drug targeted therapy, in
addition to the specificity of drug carrier, is affected by
environmental factors also. In order to determine the effect
of concentration, pH, action time and inhibitor on the
absorption of Doxorubicin, dynamic experiments, uptake
experiment, substrate competitive inhibition experiment
were proceeded.
The uptake of Ala-Lys-AMCA was time-dependent
and concentration-dependent and affected by pH. Similar
to Ala-Lys-AMCA, the uptake of Doxorubicin-tripeptide
conjugate was also time-dependent and concentrationdependent, but not pH-dependent, the highest uptake
of pH was 6.0. Its uptake was significantly reduced
by inhibitors. Doxorubicin, however, did not have the
above characteristics. On the other hand, these results
proved that the expression of PEPT1 in HCC cells, and
the Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate can indeed be
transported into the liver cancer cells by PEPT1 to play a
anti-tumor action simultaneously.
Small animal imaging techniques were adopted
to evaluate the distribution of the drug in mice. We can
see that Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate was mainly
distributed in subcutaneous tumor tissue and less in
heart tissue, which revealed specificity of this drug
to tumor tissue. Part of the liver tissue also had certain
fluorescence, these tissues was confirmed liver metastases
by the pathology, which further verified the tumor target of
Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate. In the control group of
HepG2 mice, tumor tissue also showed high fluorescence
intensity, maybe it was related to some experimental
error, or maybe influenced by deficiencies of fluorescence
imaging itself, for example weak sensitivity, the effect
of background noise, the differences of exposure time
and location, biological tissue light absorption and light
scattering effect of their own and so on [32].
The antitumor effects of Doxorubicin-tripeptide
conjugate were evaluated by MTT and nude mice
tumor xenograft model experiments in vitro and in vivo
respectively. Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate shows
a better anti-cancer treatment with greater efficacy and
lower toxicity, described as follows:

Doxorubicin. Since the Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate
was synthesized by Doxorubicin and a tripeptide. The
molecular weight of Doxorubicin-tripeptide is larger then
that of Doxorubicin. The higer IC50 of Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate may correlate with the molecular
weight difference between Doxorubicin-tripeptide
conjugate and Doxorubicin. Furthermore, the PEPT1
transport activity also influence the delivery efficiency of
Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate into HCC cells. In vivo
test, according to the dose equivalent principle, we fed the
tumor xenograft model mice with Doxorubicin-tripeptide
conjugate 5 times dose than Doxorubicin. Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate can inhibit the increase of tumor
volume and weight significantly, prolong the survival time
and improve the quality of life of HCC mice. During the
period of this drug, there was no decrease in food and water
intake, some mice present weight and intake increased and
with good spirit and activity.

Toxicity
The main side effects of Doxorubicin were
gastrointestinal symptoms, systemic symptoms, cardiac
toxicity and bone marrow toxicity.
Firstly, with the development of HCC disease, mice
appeared appetite and intake decreased, lethargy, weight
loss gradually, reflecting the malignant consumption
state of tumor. The above was more aggravated after
Doxorubicin applied, but little existed in Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate group.
Secondly, compare the effects of drugs on the heart.
The oxidation and antioxidation system of organisms are
relatively balanced in physiological conditions. When
oxygen free radicals produced too much and antioxidase
activity decreased, destroy of this balance will lead to a
series of lipid peroxidation reaction, eventually leading
to cell damage and even death. This is also one of the
important mechanisms of cardiac toxicity induced by
Doxorubicin [33, 34]. GSH-PX was able to catalyze
reduction reaction of reduced glutathione with hydrogen
peroxide specifically, and remove harmful peroxide
metabolites timely, thereby block a series of lipid
peroxidation and protect structure and function of cell
completely [35]. The activity of SOD indirectly reflects
the ability of removing oxygen free radicals [36]. MDA is
a degradation product of unsaturated fatty acid. Therefore,
the level of GSH-PX, SOD and MDA is related to the
severity of the cardiac disease, and also is a sensitive
indicator of cardiac cell damage [37]. The more serious
myocardial cell injury, the lower the serum levels of GSHPX and SOD, and the higher myocardial enzyme and
MDA level [38]. In this research, the amplitude of elevated
myocardial enzymes, MDA and decreased GSH-PX, SOD
were not obvious in the group of Doxorubicin-tripeptide
conjugate, which suggested that this targeted-drug was less
damage to the heart.

Efficacy
In MTT test, Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate
can inhibit the growth of two hepatocarcinoma cell lines
and the inhibition rate achieved to 68.73%. The IC50 of
Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate was higher than that of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Finally, according to the peripheral blood and bone
marrow smear test, Doxorubicin had obvious inhibitory
effect on bone marrow, whereas this side effect can
significantly reduced by the carrier of PEPT1, which
transported Doxorubicin targeted to tumor tissue with little
action to normal tissues.
Immunohistochemistry proceeded in tumor, liver,
heart and jejunum tissues of mice revealed the positive
expression of PEPT1 in tumor and liver metastasis
tissues, little expression in healthy tissues, which was
also provided the theoretical evidence for PEPT1 as the
carrier of Doxorubicin. It was proved by vivo and vitro
experiment that the safety and efficacy of Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate administrated for HCC through carrier
PEPT1. Furthermore, PEPT1 can be used as a ideal carrier
of doxorubicin in targeted therapy for HCC. In addition,
all of these strategies in this manuscript should be verified
by large sample research and further clinical applications.
In conclusion, this study will provide an experimental
basis for further clarifying the function of the promising
carrier PEPT1 and the efficacy of its targeted drug.

Proliferation inhibition assay by MTT
Cells in the growth log phase were seeded in
96-well plate (200 ul/well) with density 8×103/well for
24 hours, then the drugs were added. The concentration
of Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate was 0.005 mg/ml,
0.01 mg/ml, 0.02 mg/ml, 0.04 mg/ml, 0.06 mg/ml in turn,
while Doxorubicin followed by 0.005 mg/ml, 0.01 mg/ml,
0.02 mg/ml, 0.04 mg/ml, 0.06 mg/ml with a same dosing
volume 100 µl. Each concentration group included five
equal wells and was provided with a control well of
medium alone as a negative control. Add 20 µl of MTT
Reagent ( 5 mg/ml, Sigma) to each well, including
controls and continue to be incubated at 37°C for 4 hours.
Remove the supernatant, drop plus DMSO (200 µl/well)
and measure the OD value in each well, including the
blanks, at 490 nm by a Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek,

half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) according to
the formula: Inhibitory rate =(1-( the dosing group OD/the
control group OD )) × 100%, IC50 = lg-1 (Xm-i (ΣP-0.5))
(Xm: the logarithm of maximum concentration, I: the
logarithm of maximum dose/ adjacent dose, P: the sum of
each group inhibitory rate, Pm: the maximum inhibitory
rate, Pn: the minimum inhibitory rate ).

Uptake Studies
The transport of Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate
by PEPT1 was evaluated by time course, dynamic and
competitive inhibition tests. The uptake study was
performed on the confluent cell monolayer as described
previously [8, 9].
The uptake buffer was HBSS buffer (0.952 mM
CaCl2 , 5.36 mM KCl, 0.441 mM KH2PO4, 0.812 mM
MgSO4, 136.7 mM NaCl, 0.385 mM Na2HPO4, 25 mM
D-glucose, and 10 mM HEPES) adjusted to pH 6.0. First,
the time course test was observed at the same pH value
(6.0) with 0.05 mg/ml Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate
at different time points (0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min).
Then four different initial concentrations (0.025 mg/ml,
0.05 mg/ml, 0.10 mg/ml, 0.15 mg/ml) of Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate were incubated with HCC cell
monolayer at pH 6.0 for 120 min. At last, 0.05 mg/ml
Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate was fed to HCC cells
at different pH uptake buffer (5.4, 6, 7.4 and 8.4) for
120 min. Inhibition tests were conducted by preincubating
the cells with competitive compounds Gly-Sar, Gly-Gln,
Gly-Gly-Gly (0.01 mg/ml) respectively for 30 mins and
then incubated with Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate
(0.05 mg/ml) for 1 h. After removing the buffer and
rapidly washing 3 times with ice-cold PBS, the cellular
uptake was specifically examined with a Multi-Mode
Reader (BioTek, Synergy 2, USA) with Excitation 485/20
and Emission 590/35.

Fluorescence microscope Observation
All cell lines were cultured in 6-well plates for one
day, after the cells were adherent to the plate aspirated the
culture medium and washed with PBS twice. Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate (0.05 mg/ml) and Doxorubicin
(0.01  mg/ml) were added and incubated avoid light at
37°C for 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h respectively. Then
the cells were washed again with PBS and observed finally
under the Fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS IX51).

HPLC analysis
When the density of HCC cells reached to 3 × 106/ml,
they were trypsinized and centrifuge (4°C, 800rpm, 5min),
then discarded the supernatant, dropping medium 3 ml
and evenly mixed. Cell suspension was divided into three
groups (control group, Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate
group and Doxorubicin group). The drug concentration

Ethical standards

Nude mouse tumor xenograft model

All procedures performed in studies involving
human participants were in accordance with the ethical
standards of the research committee of Tianjin Medical
University General Hospital, China. All participants
gave written informed consent before participating in
the study. The research program was approved by the
ethics committee of Tianjin Medical University General
Hospital, China.

An animal model of HCC cells (Bel-7402, HepG2)
transplanted into nude mice was established according to
the method described in ref. 10.

Group-division and treatment
After the HCC mice model was established, the
nude mice were randomly assigned to three groups: Group
A (control group: administration with normal saline 0.2 ml
every time), group B (administration with Doxorubicintripeptide conjugate) and group C (administration with
Doxorubicin). Meanwhile administration was divided
into low dose group (HepG2) with Doxorubicin 40 mg/m2
and Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate 200 mg/m2 and high
dose group (Bel-7402) with Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and
Doxorubicin-tripeptide conjugate 300 mg/m2 by rat tail
vein [10]. Treatment was conducted every 3 weeks for
5 weeks. Pay close attention to the general condition of the
mice and their subcutaneous tumor and draw survivorship
curve. The mice were weighed every 3 days and tumor
volume was measured with a digital caliper using the
formula: volume = (1/6).π. length × width × height. At
the end of the experiment, tumor weight and volume was
measured to obtained the tumor inhibitory rate and actual
volume, which were calculated by the follow formula
respectively: tumor inhibitory rate = (The average tumor
weight of control group-experimental group)/control
group × 100 %. volume = (1/6).π. length × width × height.
