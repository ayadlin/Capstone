ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancers show significant tumor cell heterogeneity within the same
core genetic background. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important
functional aspect of this heterogeneity and hallmark of colorectal cancer progression.
Here, we identify CYB5R1, an enzyme involved in oxidative stress protection and drug
metabolism, as an indicator of EMT in colon cancer. We demonstrate high CYB5R1
expression in colorectal cancer cells undergoing EMT at the infiltrative tumor edge
and reveal an extraordinarily strong association of CYB5R1 expression with two core
EMT gene expression signatures in a large independent colon cancer data set from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that CYB5R1 is required
for an infiltrative tumor cell phenotype, and robustly linked with poor prognosis in
colorectal cancer. Our findings have important implications for colon cancer cells
undergoing EMT and may be exploited for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

in part is reflected in differential tumor cell morphology
within the same genetic background.
Specifically infiltrative tumor cells at the leading
tumor edge are suspected drivers of malignant progression
in CRC [4]. In addition to an undifferentiated morphology,
this tumor cell subset has been demonstrated to partially
lose epithelial characteristics and gain mesenchymal traits,
a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
[7]. Known inducers of EMT in CRC are transcription
factors such as ZEB1 and SNAIL1 which promote colon
cancer cell invasion while increasing the expression of
mesenchymal markers including Vimentin, Fibronectin
and Laminin gamma 2 [8–10]. At the same time, the
expression of the epithelial cell adhesion molecule
E-Cadherin is reduced, apparently allowing tumor cells
to detach from the tumor mass during stromal infiltration
[11]. By promoting invasion, EMT contributes to tumor
progression and metastasis, and is associated with poor
prognosis in colorectal and other cancers [12, 13].

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy
with worldwide incidence rates ranking second in men
and third in women among all diagnosed cancers [1].
The genetic basis of CRC is quite well understood with
a spectrum of accumulating mutations in key signaling
pathways such as WNT, MAPK and TP53 that transform
normal colonic mucosa into invasively growing tumors
[2]. Although key mutations are mostly clonal within each
tumor and affect most tumor cells [3], CRCs are composed
of heterogeneous tumor cell subpopulations with distinct
phenotypes and functions [4]. Tumor cell heterogeneity
can be observed in most CRCs on the histological level,
where cancer cells at the leading tumor edge appear
undifferentiated and infiltrate surrounding stromal tissue
[5]. In contrast, cancer cells of the tumor center are more
differentiated and typically form glandular secondary
structures [6]. This illustrates that tumor cell heterogeneity

Moreover, EMT has been linked to putative cancer stem
cell characteristics and appears to promote chemo- and
radiotherapy resistance of colon cancer cells [14].
Since colon cancer cells undergoing EMT are crucial
for CRC progression, their detection and characterization
might aid the development of therapies that specifically
target EMT, reduce therapy resistance, and improve
patient prognosis [15]. Here, we identify high expression
of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 1 (CYB5R1), an
enzyme about which relatively little is known, and
which is part of an enzyme family involved in oxidative
stress reactions and drug metabolism [16], in CRC cells
undergoing EMT. Moreover, CYB5R1 expression directly
links EMT and poor prognosis in this tumor entity. Our
findings not only indicate high biomarker potential of
CYB5R1, but importantly identify a potential drug target
in tumor cells undergoing EMT at the infiltrative tumor
edge of colorectal cancer.

(68%, score 1) and 36 cases (16%, score 2), respectively,
to strong expression in 4 cases (2%, score 3, Figure 1).
Interestingly, while CYB5R1 marked most tumor cells in
cases with strong expression by definition, cancers with
weak or moderate CYB5R1 expression showed a distinct
intratumoral distribution of this protein: In most of these
tumors (83%), expression was pronounced at the infiltrative
tumor edge, and was most strong in tumor cells that invaded
the surrounding stroma by apparently detaching from the
gland forming tumor mass (Figure 1). Surrounding stromal
cells were negative or only weakly positive for CYB5R1.
Since infiltrative colon cancer cells at the leading tumor edge
are known to partially lose their epithelial phenotype [11],
we next analyzed CYB5R1 expression and the expression of
the epithelial cell adhesion protein E-Cadherin in individual
cases by confocal immune fluorescence. Indeed, CYB5R1
labelled colon cancer cells with decreased or absent
E-Cadherin expression, while gland forming tumor cells
of the tumor center showed the opposite phenotype (Figure
2). Moreover, CYB5R1 co-localized with expression of the
EMT marker Laminin gamma 2 (Figure 2). These findings
suggested that CYB5R1 most strongly marked a subset of
infiltrative, morphologically undifferentiated tumor cells
undergoing EMT at the leading tumor edge of CRC.

RESULTS
CYB5R1 marks colorectal cancer cells
undergoing EMT at the infiltrative tumor edge
To learn about the significance of CYB5R1
in CRC, we initially characterized its expression in
normal mucosa and in a collection of 221 CRC cases by
immunohistochemistry. Normal colonic mucosa, adjacent to
cancer tissues, demonstrated faint CYB5R1 expression that
was confined to few epithelial cells at the crypt base (data not
shown). In CRC, staining revealed a spectrum of CYB5R1
expression, ranging from negative in 31 cases (14%,
score 0), through weak and moderate expression in 150 cases

CYB5R1 gene expression is strongly linked
to EMT in colon cancer
To further examine a possible link of CYB5R1
and EMT in colon cancer, we analyzed independent
gene expression data of 457 colon cancer cases from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In these data, Gene Set
Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) revealed highly significant

(p<0.001) correlations of CYB5R1 mRNA expression and
the expression of two published core EMT gene signatures
[17, 18], strongly linking CYB5R1 and EMT (Figure 3A).
Moreover, markers that induce or indicate EMT in colon
cancer were significantly overexpressed in tumors with
high CYB5R1 levels, including ZEB1 (r=0.20, p<0.0001),
TWIST1 (r=0.22, p<0.0001), and VIM (r=0.29, p<0.0001)
(Figure 3B). In contrast, the epithelial differentiation marker
CDH1 negatively correlated with CYB5R1 in this data
set (r=-0.15, p=0.001, Figure 3B). These findings further
supported the idea that CYB5R1 is an indicator of EMT and
confirmed our in situ findings for CYB5R1 and E-Cadherin
on the mRNA level in a large independent data set.

malignant traits of colon cancer cells. We treated
DLD-1 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines with siRNAs
specifically directed against CYB5R1 mRNA, which
resulted in reduction of CYB5R1 protein levels in both
cell lines, when compared to control siRNA treatment
(Figure 4A). We then seeded cells with and without
CYB5R1 depletion in Boyden Chamber assays, and
observed considerable decreases in transwell migration
and invasion of both cell lines, while these effects were
more pronounced in HCT116 than in DLD-1 colon
cancer cells (Figure 4B, 4C). These findings suggested
that CYB5R1 not only indicated EMT in colon cancer
but also was functionally required for an EMT associated
invasive and migratory colon cancer cell phenotype.

CYB5R1 expression in CRC. In our collection of 221
CRCs, CYB5R1 expression scores (Figure 1) strongly
separated patients with good (score 0, five-year survival
rate 97%), moderate (scores 1 and 2, five-year survival
rates 80% and 74%, respectively), and poor (score 3,
five-year survival rate 25%) cancer specific survival at an
inter-observer agreement of κ=0.56 (Figure 5A). Testing
for disease free survival yielded similar, yet slightly less
stark results (Figure 5B). Based on these findings and
due to low frequency of cases with CYB5R1 score 3, we
then re-classified cases into CYB5R1 negative (score 0)
and CYB5R1 positive (scores 1-3) categories only
(inter-observer agreement κ=0.69). Again, Kaplan-Meier
statistics revealed significantly worse cancer specific
survival and marginally worse disease free survival
of CYB5R1 positive cases (Figures 5C, 5D). Next,
we evaluated co-occurrences of CYB5R1 expression
with other clinical/pathological variables. CYB5R1
positivity was associated with low tumor grade and was
more frequent in cancers of the left colon or rectum,
whereas no correlations with age, gender, or T-category
were found (Table 1). Including these variables into a
proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that
CYB5R1 positivity was an independent predictor of poor
tumor specific survival in CRC, indicating a high relative
risk (hazard ratio 8.5, Table 2). Finally, to independently
validate these findings, we tested for clinical correlations
of CYB5R1 mRNA levels in the TCGA data set of 457
colon cancers. Using ROC curve analyses, we determined
an optimal cutoff score of 584.5 normalized mRNA reads
(Figure 6A), and dichotomal classification of cases by

this score revealed a strong positive correlation of high
CYB5R1 expression and poor cancer specific survival
in Kaplan-Meier statistics (Figure 6B). In line with
these findings, cases with high CYB5R1 expression also
significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis
(Figure 6C) and distant metastasis (Figure 6D). Again,
proportional hazards regression analyses including key
clinical variables proved independent prognostic power of
CYB5R1 expression in this data set (Table 3). Collectively,
CYB5R1 expression is a strong and independent marker of
poor prognosis in CRC.

DISCUSSION
The ability to assume different morphologies and
phenotypes within the same core genetic background
implies substantial tumor cell plasticity of colorectal
cancer cells [19]. In this context, EMT might be the most
significant phenotypic switch, allowing tumor cells at
the leading edge to lose cellular junctions and polarity,
with acquisition of migratory and invasive properties that
eventually enable tumor spread from original to metastatic
sites [9, 20]. Characterizing CRC cells that undergo EMT
therefore appears strategically important to identify
drug-targetable weaknesses of this infiltrative tumor cell
subset, envisioning the development of more effective
therapeutic strategies, especially for late stage disease
[15]. In addition, determining the degree of general EMT
potential in CRCs may allow separating more and less
aggressive tumors with subsequent adjustment of clinical
management.

Here, we establish CYB5R1 as a potential marker for
CRC cells of an infiltrative EMT like tumor cell phenotype
which can be used to easily visualize this tumor cell
subset in situ by immunostaining in primary colon cancer
tissues. Markers that indicate EMT in tissues are sparse,
and detection of typical EMT markers such as ZEB1,
SNAIL1, or Vimentin is difficult in primary colon cancers,
as reflected by few convincing in situ studies [21, 22].
Additionally, interpretation of EMT marker expression often
is confounded by strong labelling of tumor-surrounding
stromal cells in which tumor cells undergoing EMT may be
difficult to identify [23]. CYB5R1 apparently overcomes

some of these restrictions by most strongly labelling
tumor cells at the leading tumor edge, with little or absent
expression in surrounding stromal cells. Nevertheless,
CYB5R1 staining is not absolutely exclusive to infiltrative
dissociating tumor cells but extends to the glandular tumor
cell compartment, especially in cases with strong CYB5R1
expression, which mirrors limited exclusiveness of other
core EMT markers for morphologically dissociating CRC
cells, such as ZEB1 and SNAIL1 [21, 23]. Therefore, it
remains to be determined to what extent infiltrative tumor
cell morphology and EMT phenotypes indicate identical
tumor cell subpopulations in CRC.

The link between CYB5R1 and EMT is greatly
strengthened by our data from gene set enrichment
analyses (GSEA), which revealed an extraordinarily
strong correlation of CYB5R1 mRNA expression, and
the expression of two core EMT gene signatures [17, 18]
in a large independent data set from the TCGA. This not
only implies that CYB5R1 may be specifically useful to
determine the overall degree of EMT and cellular plasticity
of individual colon cancers, regardless of its intratumoral
distribution. It may also indicate significant CYB5R1
enzymatic activity within colon cancer cells undergoing
EMT. CYB5R1 is part of a family of genes encoding for
redox enzymes that are involved in the transfer of reducing
equivalents from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH). These enzymes are found in soluble and in

membrane bound forms, and the latter are expressed in
various tissues where they are involved in oxidative stress
protection, prevention of apoptosis and detoxification
processes [24, 25], but also in drug metabolism of
carcinogenic and anticancer drugs [16, 26]. While this
suggests that colon cancer cells with high CYB5R1
expression undergoing EMT are highly metabolically
active, specifically resistant to apoptosis, and protected
from carcinogenic mutagens, our findings have important
implications for a potential targetability of this tumor
cell subset. The activation of amidoxime prodrugs to
amidines requires mitochondrial activity of cytochrome
b5, its reductases, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing
component (mARC) [27]. If CYB5R1 expression indicates
high activity of this metabolic pathway, we hypothesize

that this may open opportunities for specifically designed
amidoxime drugs targeting EMT in CRC. Moreover,
since our in vitro data suggested dependence of migratory
and invasive colon cancer cell phenotypes on CYB5R1
expression, inhibition of this enzyme may as well hold
potential for therapeutic intervention. In such contexts
CYB5R1 might be an easily assessable biomarker on
the tissue level, in addition to indicating EMT. However,

therapeutic interference with cytochrome reductases in
cancer will require careful evaluation, since for certain
entities tumor suppressor functions of these enzymes were
recently reported [28].
EMT is considered regulator of invasion and
metastasis and thus cancer progression [12], and our data
on CYB5R1 provide additional evidence for this concept.

data, stratified for survival assessment, CYB5R1 proved
to be a useful predictor of poor prognosis. However, since
prognostic markers tested in individual case collections can

be of limited value, we subsequently validated our findings
in the large data set of colon cancers from the TCGA, where
high CYB5R1 expression also was linked to earlier tumor
dependent death, as well as to nodal and distant metastasis.

Importantly, in both case collections, poor survival prediction
by CYB5R1 protein or mRNA was independent of other key
clinical variables, and thus could be useful to complement
cancer staging, when evaluating patient prognosis [29]. High
CYB5R1 expression may therefore identify CRC patients
in need of increased clinical attention that may benefit from
more aggressive or adjuvant treatment strategies. We suggest
that this independent prognostic power of CYB5R1 is due
to gauging EMT, not significantly reflected in other clinical
variables. Nevertheless, before clinical implementation of
CYB5R1 as a prognostic marker, our findings will require
further independent validation. Collectively, we here
demonstrate an important link of CYB5R1, EMT and colon
cancer progression that might be exploited for diagnostic and
eventually therapeutic purposes in CRC patients.

Staining was evaluated independently by two observers
that were blinded from clinical outcome. For each case,
CYB5R1 staining was categorized into complete absence of
staining (negative, score 0), low intensity staining of tumor
cells (weak expression, score 1), high intensity staining of
less than 50 % of tumor cells (moderate expression, score 2),
and high intensity staining of 50 % or more tumor cells
(strong expression, score 3). Inter-observer agreement was
calculated by κ-statistics [31]. For immune fluorescence, 5
μm whole tissue sections were deparaffinized and antigens
were retrieved in TRS6 (Dako Cytomation) for 20 min in
a microwave oven. Slides then were incubated sequentially
with anti-CYB5R1 Ab and mouse anti-Laminin gamma 2
monoclonal Ab (Milipore, D4B5, 1:200), or mouse anti-ECadherin monoclonal Ab (Santa Cruz, 1:50) for 1 h each
at room temperature, washed with PBS, and then with
AlexaFluor 565 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Abcam,
1:500) and AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse
(Invitrogen; 1:500). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI
(Vector Laboratories). Confocal fluorescence images were
taken on a LSM 700 laser scanning microscope using the
ZEN software (Carl Zeiss). Isotype-controls were included
for all antibodies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical samples
CRC specimens from patients that underwent
intentionally curative surgical resection between 1994
and 2006 at the LMU were drawn from the archives of
the institute of pathology. Follow-up data were recorded
by the Munich Cancer Registry. Specimens and data were
anonymized, and the need for consent was waived by the
institutional ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of
the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU).
Inclusion criteria were patients with localized colorectal
adenocarcinomas and absence of nodal (N0) or distant
metastasis (M0) at the time of diagnosis (UICC stage I and
II [30]). None of the patients received adjuvant therapies.
Staging and grading was reviewed for all cases. Tumor
tissues were assembled into tissue microarrays (TMAs)
with representative 1 mm cores, including triplicates of
tumor edges and tumor centers of each case. The final
collection consisted of 221 CRC cases of which in 43 cases
(19%) patients had died of their tumor within the follow-up
period. For tumor specific survival analysis, CRC attributed
deaths were defined as clinical endpoints. For analysis of
disease free survival, tumor progression after surgical
resection was the clinical endpoint, documented as either
tumor recurrence or metastasis. Cancer specific survival
was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and groups were
compared with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards
model was used for multivariate analysis. Statistics were
calculated using SPSS (IBM).

TCGA colon cancer data
Gene expression (RNA-Seq) data and corresponding
clinical data of 457 colon cancer samples were retrieved
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (https://
tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). Patients that died with tumor
being present were defined as the clinical endpoint for
tumor specific survival. For binary classification of cases,
receiver operated characteristics (ROC) curve analysis
were used to determine optimal CYB5R1 cutoff values.
Kaplan-Meier curves, statistics and multivariate analyses
were done as described above.

Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) and
heat maps
Pearson correlations of CYB5R1 expression and
expression of 20,531 genes within the TCGA data set
were calculated and genes were ranked accordingly.
GSEA analyses were conducted using this ranked gene
list against C2 curated gene sets from the Molecular
Signatures Database v5.0 (Broad Institute). The default
parameters of GSEA with gene lists of 15 to 500 genes
were used and analyses were run with 1,000 permutations.
Heat maps and clustering for individual EMT factors were
calculated with the GENE-E software (Broad Institute).

penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Biochrom). For
transient CYB5R1 knockdown or control transfection,
pre-designed siRNAs were purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientific, and transfected into both cell lines at 10 nM
final concentration using HiPerFect (Qiagen).
For immunoblotting, transfected colon cancer
cells were harvested after 48 h, whole cell lysates were
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors
(Roche), and blotted onto PVDF membranes (Merck
Millipore). Membranes then were incubated with rabbit
anti-CYB5R1 polyclonal Ab (1:1000) or mouse antiTubulin monoclonal Ab (1:50000, Sigma). Bands were
visualized using HRP-conjugated secondary mouse
(Promega) or rabbit (Sigma) Ab and Chemiluminescent
HRP Substrate (Millipore).
For transwell migration and invasion assays, 8 μm
ThinCert cell culture inserts (Greiner Bio-One) were used,
which for invasion were coated with 100 μl of 1 mg/ml
growth factor depleted Matrigel (Corning). 1x105 siRNA
transfected cells per well were seeded in serum free medium
in the upper chamber of the inserts, 500 μl serum-free
medium was added to the lower chamber, and replaced 24
hours later by DMEM with 10 % FBS. Inserts were removed
after 1 day for migration and 3 days for invasion. Cells were
fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and methanol, and stained
with crystal violet. Residual cells from the upper chamber
were removed with cotton swabs, and photomicrographs
of migrated or invaded cells were taken. For quantification,
staining from culture inserts was dissolved in 250 μl of 30
% acetic acid, and absorbance was measured at 590 nm on a
