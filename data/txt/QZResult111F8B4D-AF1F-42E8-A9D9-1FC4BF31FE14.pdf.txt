Abstract
The lack of markers to predict chemotherapy responses in patients poses a major handicap in cancer
treatment. We searched for gene expression patterns that correlate with docetaxel or cisplatin response in a
mouse model for breast cancer associated with BRCA1 deﬁciency. Array-based expression proﬁling did not
identify a single marker gene predicting docetaxel response, despite an increase in Abcb1 (P-glycoprotein)
expression that was sufﬁcient to explain resistance in several poor responders. Intertumoral heterogeneity
explained the inability to identify a predictive gene expression signature for docetaxel. To address this problem,
we used a novel algorithm designed to detect differential gene expression in a subgroup of the poor responders
that could identify tumors with increased Abcb1 transcript levels. In contrast, standard analytical tools, such as
signiﬁcance analysis of microarrays, detected a marker only if it correlated with response in a substantial fraction
of tumors. For example, low expression of the Xist gene correlated with cisplatin hypersensitivity in most tumors,
and it also predicted long recurrence-free survival of HER2-negative, stage III breast cancer patients treated with
intensive platinum-based chemotherapy. Our ﬁndings may prove useful for selecting patients with high-risk
breast cancer who could beneﬁt from platinum-based therapy. Cancer Res; 72(9); 2350–61. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Most forms of cytotoxic cancer chemotherapy also hit
normal tissues. This is acceptable when the tumor responds,
but frustrating when the tumor is intrinsically resistant and the
patient only suffers from the side effects of an unsuccessful
treatment. A major goal of molecular oncology is, therefore, to
identify biomarkers that predict the response of tumors before
treatment is started. Such predictive markers have been found
for some targeted therapies in which the target and its interaction with drugs are well deﬁned (1–7). For classical cytotoxic
chemotherapy with DNA damaging drugs or antimitotics,
however, predictive biomarkers have been harder to ﬁnd.

In an attempt to ﬁnd new biomarkers many investigators
have turned to the analysis of genome-wide gene expression
proﬁles. These proﬁles have been successful for predicting
prognosis, that is, whether patients will require adjuvant
chemotherapy after tumor removal (8). Prognostic and predictive biomarkers are fundamentally different, however (9).
To detect predictive markers, considerable effort and money
has been invested in the analysis of human breast cancer
samples (10). In particular, the neoadjuvant setting seemed
attractive to correlate gene expression proﬁles with therapy
outcome. No clear response proﬁle was obtained, however (11,
12). Other studies have gathered a number of unrelated signatures (9). These proﬁles either still await validation in an
independent study; or the sensitivity and speciﬁcity was inadequate for clinical decision making; and some were based on
ﬂawed data (13–15). Moreover, cell line–based approaches to
identify biomarkers suffer from the complication that the
multidrug resistance transcriptome has been substantially
altered during the long-term culture of these cell lines in vitro
(16).
As progress in deﬁning useful biomarkers using human
tumor material has been limited, we have turned to a mouse
model. In recent years, chemotherapy responses have been
investigated in a new generation of genetically engineered
mouse models (GEMM; ref. 17). These models employ conditional, tissue-speciﬁc activation of oncogenes and/or deletion
of tumor suppressor genes in a stochastic fashion. The

Drug Response Prediction of BRCA1-Deﬁcient Tumors

resulting tumors closely mimic the epithelial cancers in
humans. Using the K14cre;Brca1F/F;p53F/F model for hereditary
breast cancer (18), we have shown that these tumors acquire
resistance to classical and novel targeted anticancer drugs such
as the topoisomerase I–targeting camptothecin topotecan, the
topoisomerase II–inhibiting anthracycline doxorubicin, and
the PARP inhibitor olaparib (19–22). We have observed that
the initial response of these tumors is variable, as in human
tumors, thus providing an attractive opportunity to correlate
drug response with gene expression. The tumors are similar, as
they start out with the ablation of the Brca1 and the p53 genes.
Differences between tumors should make it comparatively easy
to sort out which genes determine whether a tumor responds
to drug or not. An advantage of this model is that tumors can be
orthotopically transplanted into syngeneic, immunocompetent animals without losing their molecular ﬁngerprint, morphologic phenotype, or drug sensitivity (19). Using this orthotopically transplantable mouse model, we set out to ﬁnd
predictive markers of cisplatin or docetaxel response.

Materials and Methods
Mice and drug treatments
KB1P mammary tumors were generated, genotyped, orthotopically transplanted, and treated as described (18, 19). Additional details including the generation of KB1PM mammary
tumors can be found in Supplementary Materials. All experimental procedures on animals were approved by the Animal
Ethics Committee of the Netherlands Cancer Institute.
Genome-wide expression proﬁling
RNA extraction, ampliﬁcation, and microarray hybridization using dual channel MEEBO arrays (Illumina BV) were
carried out as described (19, 22, 23). For the gene expression
analysis using single channel 45K MouseWG-6 v2.0 BeadChips
(Illumina), total RNA was processed according to the manufacture's instructions (http://www.illumina.com/products/
mousewg_6_expression_beadchip_kits_v2.ilmn). More details
on the processing and analysis of the microarray data are
presented in Supplementary Materials.
Quantitative RNA analyses using reverse transcription–
multiplex ligation–dependent probe ampliﬁcation or
TaqMan low-density arrays
These procedures were carried out as reported previously
(20, 21, 24). Additional information is presented in Supplementary Materials.
ArrayCGH
ArrayCGH data was available from a recent study (25).
Segmentation of the CGH proﬁles was done with the CGHseg
package (26). The CGHcall R package (v 2.12.0) Bioinformatics.
2007 Apr 1;23(7):892-4 pmid: 17267432 was used to call aberrations in CGH proﬁles.
FISH
Three samples per individual tumor were investigated in a
blinded fashion using tissue microarrays of the trial cohort. At

www.aacrjournals.org

least 100 nuclei per sample were assessed. More information
on the protocol is presented in Supplementary Materials. If the
number of cells with no XIST RNA clouds was more than 60%,
the sample was classiﬁed 0 for "XIST RNA cloud." In the
presence of one X chromosome detected by the RNF12 DNA
probe, XIST RNA was usually absent (loss of Xi). In the presence
of 2 X chromosomes, loss of Xi and a XaXa conﬁguration was
deﬁned as a more than 50% reduction in the number of
expected XIST RNA clouds based on the RNF12 DNA FISH.
Patients
In a previous study, stage III HER2-negative breast cancer
patients were randomly selected from a large randomized
controlled trial (RCT) carried out in the Netherlands between
1993 and 1999 (27) and analyzed for aCGH classiﬁcation (25).
Further details on these patients are presented in Supplementary Materials. All trials described in this article were approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the Netherlands Cancer
Institute.

Results
Brca1/;p53/ (KB1P) mammary tumors show
individual and reproducible differences in docetaxel or
cisplatin sensitivity
We have previously shown that individual KB1P mammary
tumors differ substantially in their response to docetaxel (19).
The response to cisplatin varied as well: although all tumors
were sensitive to cisplatin, the time until relapse differed
between tumors (19). To exploit these intertumoral differences, we analyzed docetaxel or cisplatin responses of 43
individual tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The correlation of drug sensitivities with characteristics of a
particular tumor is only possible if the responses are reproducible. We therefore explored the heterogeneity within a
single tumor by orthotopic transplantation of multiple tumor
fragments (Fig. 1). For this purpose, 3 animals carrying orthotopically transplanted fragments of the same spontaneous
tumor were treated with the maximum tolerable dose of
docetaxel on days 0, 7, and 14. Figure 1A shows that the
docetaxel response was consistent for all 3 fragments derived
from one tumor (T26 was consistently poor, T38 responded
well, and T27 fragments all had an intermediate response). The
rate at which the tumors eventually become completely resistant to docetaxel differs somewhat between fragments from
the same tumor (T38 docetaxel 3 vs. 1 or 2), as previously
observed for doxorubicin (19). The initial drug response is
reproducible, however. Also for cisplatin, we conﬁrmed that
the time to relapse was reproducible (Fig. 1B; T9 tumor
fragments all relapsed early, T13 fragments all relapsed late).
Hence, this tumor model can be used to correlate initial
docetaxel or cisplatin responses with other tumor characteristics, such as gene expression levels.
Supervised gene expression proﬁling does not yield a
general signature that correlates with docetaxel
response
In our model, we used the tumor volume as the basis for a
response classiﬁer. We found that after completion of the

initial docetaxel treatment on day 14, 22 tumors did not shrink
below their original size when treatment was started (100%)
and eventually continued growing ("poor response"). In contrast, 21 tumors regressed to a volume below 50% of the
original size ("good response") and took on average 28 days
(SD 11d) after the last docetaxel treatment to grow back to
100% (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S1). With such an
obvious separation, we expected to identify genes that are
differentially expressed between these 2 groups. To detect
these, RNA of all 43 untreated tumors was analyzed using
39K mouse exonic evidence-based oligonucleotide (MEEBO)
gene expression microarrays and 45K Illumina Sentrix mouse
V6 single-channel bead arrays. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis did not separate good from poor responders
(Supplementary Fig. S2). For the supervised analysis, we used
signiﬁcance analysis of microarrays (SAM; ref. 28), which is
frequently applied to detect differential gene expression. SAM

uses nonparametric statistics to compute for each gene a delta
that measures the strength of the relationship between gene
expression and docetaxel sensitivity. Permutations of repeated
measurements are employed to estimate the false discovery
rate (FDR). Using this approach, we expected to ﬁnd several
differentially expressed genes between good and poor docetaxel responders with a delta >0.7 (FDR < 5%). Remarkably, this
analysis did not detect a single gene that correlated with drug
sensitivity with a meaningful delta (Fig. 2B).
This negative result might be due to the lack of sensitivity of
the gene expression platforms used for genes that are relevant
for drug resistance. This is exempliﬁed by the work of Orina
and colleagues (29) on drug transporters of the ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) family. Using the NCI-60 panel of cell lines, they
showed that TaqMan low-density arrays (TLDA) are more
precise and more sensitive in measuring the expression of
these transporter genes than oligonucleotide arrays (29).

Drug Response Prediction of BRCA1-Deﬁcient Tumors

individual tumors after completion of initial treatment using 25 mg docetaxel per kg intravenously on days 0, 7, and 14. Tumors with a relative volume below
100% (bar) were classiﬁed as good responders, the remaining as poor responders. B, SAM of untreated tumors of good versus poor docetaxel responders (D ¼

docetaxel-resistant tumors and samples from the matched drug-sensitive control tumors. Error bars indicate SD of 3 independent reactions.

Within this ABC family, a number of genes has been associated
with docetaxel resistance, including ABCB1/P-glycoprotein (Pgp; ref. 30), ABCC2 (31), and ABCC10 (32). We therefore
examined whether the more quantitative TLDA analysis of

www.aacrjournals.org

the 49 genes that encode mouse ABC proteins would reveal
differences between poor and good docetaxel responders. As
shown in Fig. 2C and Supplementary Table S2, none was found
at a signiﬁcance level of P < 0.01 (Mann–Whitney U test).

We note in passing that on both platforms used to analyze
gene expression (Supplementary Fig. S2), 2 poor responders
(T26 con and T41 con) form a separate branch which correlates with the sarcomatoid morphology (carcinosarcoma) of
these tumors (Supplementary Table S1). Most likely, these 2
tumors have undergone an epithelial–mesenchymal transition, as in the K14cre;Brca1F/F;p53F/F model the Cre-mediated
deletion of the Brca1 and p53 genes selectively occurs in
epithelial cells driven by the K14 promoter. Whether such a
morphologic change correlates with drug resistance is under
investigation.
Increased gene expression of the Abcb1a and Abcb1b
genes is frequently found in acquired docetaxel
resistance
Because our analysis of gene expression did not turn up a
single gene that correlated with intrinsic docetaxel resistance,
we tested tumors with acquired docetaxel resistance. Genes
responsible for the acquired resistance might also cause
intrinsic docetaxel resistance. We therefore compared RNA
from samples of the same tumor before treatment and after
they had become resistant to docetaxel. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis did not separate sensitive from resistant
tumors. Instead, tumors derived from the same original tumor
were found in close proximity (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Exceptions are tumors T20 and T38, but the docetaxel-resistant versions of these tumors (T20 doce-res or T38 doce-res)
had a high content of stromal tissue (Supplementary Fig. S3B),
explaining the unusual distance between resistant tumor and
docetaxel–sensitive control.
The SAM analysis of docetaxel-resistant tumors versus
matched docetaxel-sensitive control tumors (Fig. 2D) yielded
9 genes that were signiﬁcantly increased in docetaxel-resistant
tumors (in red, see also Supplementary Table S3). Of these, only
the Abcb1b gene–-which encodes the mouse drug efﬂux transporter P-gp—can functionally explain docetaxel resistance.
The other 8 genes (Gng10, Gp49a, lysozyme, Lzp-s, CD18, Trem2,
Lilrb4, and Slc11a1) seem to be linked to macrophages inﬁltrating drug-treated tumors to remove dead cells, as we have
found previously for doxorubicin- or topotecan-resistant
tumors (19, 22). More precise quantiﬁcation of the Abcb1a
and Abcb1b transcripts that encode mouse P-gp by reverse
transcription–multiplex ligation–dependent probe ampliﬁcation (RT-MLPA) conﬁrmed that one or both of the Abcb1 genes
were upregulated at least 3-fold in 14 of the 17 tumors that
acquired docetaxel resistance (Fig. 2E). We also investigated
mouse Abcc1, which is a poor taxane transporter (33). Expression of this control gene was not altered in any of the docetaxelresistant tumors.
Because the expression of Abcb1a was frequently found to be
increased by RT-MLPA in the resistant tumors, it is surprising
that it was not identiﬁed by the SAM analysis shown in Fig. 2D.
This proved to be due to the poor sensitivity of the Abcb1a
probe. When we investigated T18, T20, T22, T24, T31, and T34,
the 6 tumors with a more than 10-fold increase in Abcb1a
transcripts in the resistant tumors, as determined by RTMLPA, Abcb1a was the top hit by SAM (Supplementary Fig.
S4A). However, when we added 4 tumors with only an approx-

2354

Cancer Res; 72(9) May 1, 2012

imately 4-fold increase in Abcb1a expression by RT-MLPA (T6,
T28, T29, and T38), Abcb1a was lost as a signiﬁcant gene
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). This shows that the sensitivity of
the Abcb1a probe is low in the MEEBO arrays.
Increased expression of the Abcb1a and Abcb1b genes can
explain poor docetaxel response of 5 of 22
nonresponders
In addition to conventional SAM analyses, we also tested an
algorithm designed to speciﬁcally detect differential gene
expression that only occurs in a subgroup of tumors within
the nonresponding group (de Ronde and colleagues; submitted
for publication). This algorithm places a threshold on the gene
expression corresponding to the highest expression level in the
docetaxel responder group. For the docetaxel poor responders
that exceed this threshold, the sum of the differences of the
expression is then calculated. Using this algorithm we found
that Abcb1b was among the top outliers and formed a cluster
with several other genes (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S4).
This suggested that Abcb1b is not only involved in acquired
docetaxel resistance but may also contribute to upfront docetaxel resistance of some tumors. To further investigate whether an increased expression of the Abcb1a/b genes can explain
the poor intrinsic docetaxel response of some of the 22 poor
responder tumors (Fig. 2A), we quantiﬁed the RNA levels in the
untreated tumors by RT-MLPA (Fig. 4A). In 5 of 22 tumors, we
found a 7- to 9-fold increase in Abcb1 RNA above the average
level of the good responders. Abcb1a RNA was elevated as well
in these 5 tumors (Fig. 4A). We have previously shown that a
modest upregulation of Abcb1 by a factor of 7 to 9 is sufﬁcient
to cause drug resistance in these tumors (21). Indeed, we found
that the 5 tumors with increased Abcb1 gene expression also
did not respond to the P-gp substrate doxorubicin (Fig. 4B and
Supplementary Fig. S1), whereas the poor docetaxel responders without increased Abcb1 RNA usually shrank below 50%
with doxorubicin (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S1). As
expected, there was no correlation of Abcb1 transcript levels
with cisplatin relapse-free survival (Fig. 4B and C), as cisplatin
is not a substrate of P-gp.
P-gp–deﬁcient mammary tumors are docetaxel
hypersensitive
To improve our ability to detect P-gp–independent mechanisms of docetaxel resistance, we introduced the Abcb1a/b null
alleles into the K14cre;Brca1F/F;p53F/F model. The lack of
functional P-gp did not affect mammary tumor latency or
morphology of the female K14cre;Brca1F/F;p53F/F;Abcb1a/b/
mice (data not shown). P-gp–deﬁcient mice carrying spontaneous mammary tumors cannot be treated with the docetaxel
maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) because P-gp contributes to
the normal disposition of docetaxel in the mouse. We therefore
grafted Brca1/;p53/;Abcb1a/b/ tumors (KB1PM) orthotopically into syngeneic wild-type mice (Fig. 5A). In sharp
contrast to Abcb1a/b wt tumors (KB1P), tumors unable to
make P-gp were hypersensitive to the docetaxel MTD: only 1 of
11 individual KB1PM tumors responded poorly to docetaxel
and the mouse had to be sacriﬁced 40 days after the start of
treatment (Fig. 5B). The median recurrence-free survival (RFS)

Drug Response Prediction of BRCA1-Deﬁcient Tumors

time increased signiﬁcantly (P < 0.0004) from 14 (T7-T43) to 51
days (KB1PM-1 and KB1PM-3 to -11) and for 1 tumor (KB1PM2), no relapse occurred within 250 days, suggesting that this
tumor was even eradicated (Fig. 5B and C). With the exception
of KB1PM-5 none of the P-gp–deﬁcient tumors acquired
docetaxel resistance and, eventually, the mice had to be killed
because of cumulative docetaxel toxicity. The median survival
of animals carrying orthotopically transplanted P-gp–deﬁcient
tumors increased signiﬁcantly (P < 0.0001) to 164 days (69 SD,
n ¼ 11) compared with 45 days (28 SD, n ¼ 37) of animals with
P-gp–proﬁcient tumors (Fig. 5D). These data showed that P-gp
is a major contributor to docetaxel resistance of KB1P mammary tumors in vivo.
Low expression of the Xist gene correlates with high
cisplatin sensitivity of KB1P tumors and predicts beneﬁt
of platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with highrisk primary breast cancer
Because we found variation in the response to drug, not only
for docetaxel but also for cisplatin (Fig. 6A), we wondered

www.aacrjournals.org

whether standard gene expression analyses would also fail to
identify predictive markers for this treatment. All KB1P tumors
were cisplatin sensitive, but 23 tumors relapsed already within
39 days, whereas 12 tumors only grew back to 100% after 49
days. When we stratiﬁed the gene expression proﬁles of the
untreated tumors based on their cisplatin sensitivity (above or
below the mean time to relapse), we found a low expression of
the Xist gene to correlate signiﬁcantly with cisplatin hypersensitivity on 2 independent gene expression platforms (Fig. 6B).
The physiologic role of the noncoding RNA Xist is to coat one
X chromosome of female cells in cis and subsequently trigger
chromatin remodeling to form the heterochromatic Barr body
[condensed inactivated X chromosome (Xi)]. XIST is transcribed exclusively from the Xi to achieve equal X-linked gene
dosage between the sexes. The analysis of genes correlating
with a low Xist expression in our tumor model revealed a
reduced expression of 3 other X-linked genes: Utx, Jarid1c, and
Eif2s3x (Supplementary Fig. S5). As all of these genes are known
to escape X inactivation (34), they are independent markers for
the loss of the Xi.
Given the high frequency of reduced Xist expression in
cisplatin hypersensitive mouse tumors, we tested whether
XIST expression could serve as a biomarker to predict response
to platinum-based chemotherapy in human breast cancer. For
this purpose we took tumor samples of 60 stage III, HER2negative breast cancer patients who had been randomized
between 2 treatment arms: intensive platinum-based chemotherapy or a standard anthracycline-based regimen (conventional chemotherapy; ref. 27). The patient information is
summarized in Supplementary Table S5. To quantify XIST
gene expression levels of FFPE material (>60% tumor cells),
we used RT-MLPA including 2 independent probes hybridizing
to the exon 2–3 or exon 4–5 boundary of XIST cDNA (Supplementary Table S6 and Supplementary Fig. S6). Analysis of the
RFS showed that patients with a low XIST expression significantly beneﬁted from the intensive platinum-based therapy
compared with conventional chemotherapy: the 5-year RFS
increased from 37% to 75% (Fig. 6C, adjusted HR: 0.30, 95%
conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.11–0.82 for the probe of exon 4–5,
Supplementary Table S5B). In patients with XIST gene expression above the cut-off, no signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt was
observed of platinum-based chemotherapy (5-year RFS 33%
both treatment arms, Fig. 6C; adjusted HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.23–
2.89 for the exon 4–5 probe, Supplementary Table S5B). Analyses with the exon 2–3 probe conﬁrmed those obtained with
the exon 4–5 probe (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Table S5B).
To determine whether loss of the XIST gene could explain
the low XIST gene expression detected with both RT-MLPA
probes, we analyzed the DNA of 37 patients with arrayCGH
using probes ﬂanking the XIST locus. Indeed, a XIST gene was
lost in 16 of 37 patients. Loss of XIST DNA correlated significantly with low RNA expression for all 60 patients (P < 0.017 for
the exon 2–3 probe, Fisher exact test). For 24 of the 60 samples,
we also managed to carry out XIST RNA FISH analyses on the
available FFPE material (Fig. 7). A DNA probe targeting RNF12
was taken along as X chromosome marker (Fig. 7A). RNA FISH

combination of RNA and DNA FISH showed for all cases with
aCGH-based XIST deletion that only the Xa was present (Fig.
7B). In several patients with low XIST gene expression, but no
XIST gene deletion detectable by aCGH, we found 2 active X
chromosomes and loss of Xi (Fig. 7B). Together, our data
showed that loss of Xi is the main cause of low XIST gene
expression (P < 0.027, Fig. 7C).
High prevalence of a predictive marker is required for its
detection
Because Xist was readily identiﬁed as predictive marker for
cisplatin sensitivity in our mouse model by SAM, it remains
remarkable that our initial search to detect predictive markers
for docetaxel sensitivity (Fig. 2) failed. When we analyzed only
the tumors with an intrinsically high Abcb1 expression
(T8 con, T9 con, T15 con, T26 con, and T41 con) versus the
21 docetaxel-sensitive tumors as deﬁned in Fig. 2A, Abcb1b was
one of the most signiﬁcantly increased genes on both the
MEEBO and Illumina gene expression platforms (Supplementary Fig. S4C and D). Also the TLDA expression data showed a

signiﬁcant difference for Abcb1a and Abcb1b when only the 5
poor responders were compared with the docetaxel-sensitive
tumors (Abcb1a: P < 0.0064; Abcb1b: P < 0.0043; Mann–Whitney
U test). However, as increased expression of the Abcb1 genes is
only found in a subgroup of the poor docetaxel responders, this
signiﬁcance is lost when samples with other docetaxel resistance mechanisms are added (Supplementary Fig. S7). In fact,
addition of 5 samples without Abcb1 upregulation sufﬁces to
dilute the Abcb1 signal below signiﬁcance.
In contrast to Abcb1b in the case of docetaxel treatment, the
prevalence of low Xist expression was high in cisplatin hypersensitive tumors: 11 (MEEBO platform) or 10 (Illumina platform) of the 12 showed Xist gene expression below the median
(Supplementary Fig. S7).

We have investigated whether predictive markers for
chemotherapy beneﬁt can be identiﬁed in a GEMM using
genome-wide expression proﬁling. GEMMs should be ideal

for this purpose, as they lack the profound genetic heterogeneity of tumors from human patients. The tumors originate from the targeted deletion of Brca1 and p53, and all
differences between tumors originate from random mutations in the period between the initiating deletions of Brca1
and p53 and the development of a mammary tumor. These
additional mutations are responsible for the marked and
stable differences in sensitivity to docetaxel and cisplatin
that we ﬁnd in individual tumors.
Even in this genetically homogeneous tumor system, we did
not ﬁnd a signature predicting docetaxel response, using
genome-wide expression proﬁling. This negative result is
instructive, however, because it has allowed us to delineate
what is required to get useful predictive signatures. In our
collection of 22 poor docetaxel responders, 5 tumors contained
a substantial increase in Abcb1 RNA, known to be sufﬁcient to
cause drug resistance (21). Nevertheless, this increase in Abcb1
RNA was completely missed by 2 independent platforms
measuring gene expression proﬁles. The Abcb1b transcript
was readily detected in the 5 tumors with elevated transcript

levels, as long as these tumors were analyzed as a group.
However, when the results were pooled with those from only
5 tumors without elevated Abcb1b RNA, the positive result was
completely lost. This shows why it is difﬁcult to develop
predictive markers, based on genome-wide expression arrays:
only if the response to a drug is primarily determined by the
expression level of a gene in most tumors, one can expect that
gene to show up in the array-based gene expression analyses.
We found such a gene in analyzing the response of the mouse
tumors to cisplatin. The low Xist expression associated with
tumors hypersensitive to cisplatin was present in 10 of 12
tumors and therefore detectable in our array analysis. The
detection sensitivity can only be increased by the use of special
algorithms that can identify subgroups within the samples. We
show that such an algorithm is able to identify Abcb1b as
outlier within the poor docetaxel responders. However, even
with a more sophisticated analysis, the problem remains that
probes on the arrays are not sensitive enough to detect all
relevant expression differences of genes causing therapy resistance. Gillet and colleagues found in a panel of cancer cell lines

that the expression of the 380 "resistance-relevant" genes could
only be reliably measured by quantitative PCR. For many genes
the results obtained by microarrays were useless because of
low sensitivity (29, 35).
Given all these hurdles in ﬁnding predictive markers for
chemotherapy, it is gratifying that we identiﬁed a gene that
correlated with cisplatin response. It is encouraging that
the low expression of XIST predicting high sensitivity to
cisplatin in drug-naive mouse tumors also predicted an
increased RFS of high risk, primary breast cancer patients
treated with intensive platinum-based chemotherapy.
Although detected in a rather small group of 60 patients,
the effect found is considerable. Intensive chemotherapy
has largely been abandoned for the treatment of breast
cancer because for many patients the therapeutic beneﬁt is
limited (36). Nevertheless, several studies suggest that
there are subgroups of patients that do beneﬁt from this
therapy, but the predictive tests to identify them are
lacking (37, 38). Hence, the analysis of XIST gene expression

may be a useful tool to decide whether intensive platinumbased chemotherapy should be considered as alternative
therapy for patients with HER2-negative, high-risk breast
cancer. Not all patients with a low XIST expression that we
investigated beneﬁted from the platinum-based therapy.
An optimized cut-off for the level of XIST expression,
validated in prospective clinical trials, may increase the
positive predictive value, as may a combination with other
classiﬁers, such as BRCA1-like CGH proﬁles (25).
Why tumors with a low expression of XIST are platinum
hypersensitive is under investigation. Low XIST gene expression may be a ﬂag for genomic instability as we found loss of Xi
as the main cause underlying low transcript levels. The loss of
Xi is most likely the consequence of chromosome segregation
errors, which may be enhanced in BRCA1-defective cells due to
a compromised spindle checkpoint (39). It has recently been
found that mis-segregation stress induces a DNA damage
response (40), and it was observed that aneuploid cells are
more sensitive to antiproliferative drugs (41). Mammary tumor

cells with defects in DNA repair that are additionally stressed
by improper execution of mitosis may therefore be hypersensitive to intensive platinum-based therapy.
The precise mechanism of XIST-mediated X inactivation is
still under debate (42). It was suggested that BRCA1 supports the localization of XIST RNA to the Xi, as the BRCA1deﬁcient cells or tumors examined had lost localized XIST
RNA (43–45). However, this hypothesis was challenged by
others (46, 47). The recent ﬁnding that BRCA1 maintains
heterochromatin integrity (48) supports the idea that BRCA1
contributes to X inactivation after XIST-induced chromatin
condensation. The contribution is not a simple one, however. Despite the large Brca1 deletion present in all mammary tumors of our mouse model, Xist gene expression
varies considerably. Variability of XIST expression was also
present in those human breast cancers in which a BRCA1
mutation was found, or which were classiﬁed as BRCA1-like
by aCGH (25).
Our study shows that GEMMs that resemble breast cancer in
humans are useful to investigate chemotherapy response
prediction. Tools to identify predictive markers can be tested
under controlled conditions, and targeted ablation of genes
helps to dissect mechanisms of resistance. Ultimately, predictive markers identiﬁed in GEMMs may improve the clinical
success rate for chemotherapy in humans.
