Abstract
BCR/ABL kinase–positive chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) cells display genomic instability leading to point
mutations in various genes including bcr/abl and p53,
eventually causing resistance to imatinib and malignant
progression of the disease. Mismatch repair (MMR) is
responsible for detecting misincorporated nucleotides, resulting in excision repair before point mutations occur and/or
induction of apoptosis to avoid propagation of cells carrying
excessive DNA lesions. To assess MMR activity in CML, we used
an in vivo assay using the plasmid substrate containing
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene corrupted by
T:G mismatch in the start codon; therefore, MMR restores
EGFP expression. The efficacy of MMR was reduced f2-fold in
BCR/ABL-positive cell lines and CD34+ CML cells compared
with normal counterparts. MMR was also challenged by
N-methyl-N ’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), which generates O 6-methylguanine and O 4-methylthymine recognized by
MMR system. Impaired MMR activity in leukemia cells was
associated with better survival, accumulation of p53 but not of
p73, and lack of activation of caspase 3 after MNNG treatment.
In contrast, parental cells displayed accumulation of p53, p73,
and activation of caspase 3, resulting in cell death. Ouabainresistance test detecting mutations in the Na+/K+ ATPase was
used to investigate the effect of BCR/ABL kinase–mediated
inhibition of MMR on mutagenesis. BCR/ABL-positive cells
surviving the treatment with MNNG displayed f15-fold higher
mutation frequency than parental counterparts and predominantly G:C!A:T and A:T!G:C mutator phenotype typical for
MNNG-induced unrepaired lesions. In conclusion, these
results suggest that BCR/ABL kinase abrogates MMR activity
to inhibit apoptosis and induce mutator phenotype. [Cancer

Introduction
BCR/ABL oncogenic tyrosine kinase transforms hematopoietic
stem cells to induce chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and
acute lymphocytic leukemia (1). In addition to its capability to
transform hematopoietic stem cells, BCR/ABL kinase can increase

DNA damage and compromise the fidelity of DNA repair, causing
genomic instability (2). Accumulation of genetic abnormalities is
believed to be responsible for resistance to the ABL kinase small
molecule inhibitors, such as imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, and
for transition of a relatively benign chronic phase (CML-CP) to the
aggressive blast crisis (CML-BC).
Point mutations in BCR/ABL kinase sequence play a major role
in resistance to small molecule inhibitors; overall, point mutations
in the kinase domain of BCR/ABL have been detected in 50% to
90% of patients with acquired resistance to imatinib, including
f23% of the imatinib-naive patients (3). In addition, inactivating
point mutations in p53 and Rb may contribute to the transition of
CML-CP to CML-BC (4).
Our recent findings indicated that BCR/ABL-positive leukemia
cells accumulate more DNA lesions due to enhanced levels of
endogenous reactive oxygen species, resulting in point mutations
(5, 6). Mismatch repair (MMR) system maintains genomic stability
by removing mismatched bases from DNA and by inducing
apoptosis in cells with excessive unrepairable DNA damage (7).
Single-base mismatches are recognized by the MSH2-MSH6
heterodimer followed by MLH1-PMS2 heterodimer, which couples
mismatch recognition step to downstream processes that include
the removal of the mismatch from the nascent DNA strand,
resynthesis of the degraded region, and ligation of the remaining
nick. However, MMR also induces accumulation of p53 and p73,
leading to activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis.
MMR activity in CML has been investigated indirectly by
measuring microsatellite instability, which seems to reflect
multiple replication errors because of the defective MMR (8).
Microsatellite instability was not detected in the relatively benign
CML-CP but was present in multiple loci in CML-BC (9). However,
in CML-BC, microsatellite instability might be induced by
secondary aberrations, thus not directly mediated by BCR/ABL.
Results presented here show that BCR/ABL kinase inhibits
MMR, resulting in better survival and accumulation of point
mutations, which may contribute to genomic instability in
Philadelphia chromosome–positive leukemias.

Materials and Methods
Cells. 32Dcl3, BaF3 murine interleukin (IL)-3–dependent cell lines, and
their BCR/ABL-transformed counterparts were described before (6). Cell
lines were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and pretested concentrations of
WEHI-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3 required to maintain the
proliferation of parental cells. CML-CP and CML-BC patient cells were
obtained from the Stem Cell and Leukemia Core Facility of the University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA, and the Institute of Hematology and
Blood Transfusions, Warsaw, Poland, after receiving informed consent.

BCR/ABL Inhibits Mismatch Repair

Figure 1. BCR/ABL-positive leukemia cells display reduced MMR activity. A, experimental model to measure MMR activity as described by Lei et al. (11).
Reporter plasmid containing T:G heteroduplex mismatch and control plasmid containing homoduplex T:A are shown. MMR-mediated repair of T:G to T:A restores
the starting codon and EGFP expression. Control plasmid containing intact EGFP sequence was used to monitor transfection efficiency. B, parental (P) and
BCR/ABL-positive (B/A ) BaF3 and 32Dcl3 cells, B/A-32Dcl3 cells preincubated with 1 Amol/L imatinib (B/A+IM ), and CD34+ bone marrow cells from healthy donors
(H ) and CML-CP patients (CML ) were electroporated with T:G heteroduplex and T:A homoduplex EGFP cDNAs. Relative EGFP expression in each group was
measured 48 h later by flow cytometry. MMR efficiency was calculated as described in Materials and Methods. Results represent mean F SD from four experiments;
P value compared with the corresponding B/A or CML group.

CD34+ CML cells were obtained using human CD34+ selection cocktail
(StemCell Technologies, Inc.). CD34+ normal bone marrow cells were from
Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc. Primary cells were seeded in IMDM
medium supplemented with 10% FBS and conditioned medium from baby
hamster kidney–MKL cells (10%v/v) as a source of stem cell factor and
5 ng/mL of human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and 2 ng/mL of human recombinant IL-3 (PeproTech, Inc.). Cells
were preincubated for 24 h with 40 Amol/L O 6-benzylguanine (Sigma
Chemicals) to inhibit O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase followed by
the treatment with N-methyl-N ’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG; Sigma).
Western analysis. Total cell lysates were prepared as previously
described (10) and analyzed by Western blotting with the use of the
following rabbit antibodies: anti-p73 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p53
(Novocastra), anti-active caspase 3 (Becton Dickinson Biosciences), and
anti-tubulin (Calbiochem).
Ouabain resistance. Na+/K+ ATPase mutagenesis leading to ouabain
resistance was examined as described before with modifications (6). Briefly,
106 cells growing in the presence of 1 Amol/L MNNG were plated in
methylcellulose (StemCell Technologies) supplemented with WEHI-conditioned medium with or without 0.5 mmol/L ouabain (Sigma); colonies were
counted after 7 d. Percentage of resistant cells was calculated as follows:
number of colonies in the presence of ouabain  100/number of colonies
without ouabain. Ouabain-resistant single colonies were harvested,
expanded, and murine a1 subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase was amplified by
reverse transcription-PCR and sequenced.
Construction of T:G heteroduplex- and T:A homoduplex-containing
plasmid substrates. Plasmid substrates used to calculate MMR activity
were constructed as described by Lei et al. (11). Briefly, p95-1 construct
(kindly obtained from Dr. LuZhe Sun, University of Texas Health Science
Center, San Antonio, TX) was digested with ApaI and NruI (Promega). The
larger fragment was isolated from agarose gel with Qiaex II (Qiagen, Inc.).
Purified DNA was divided into three samples to generate a heteroduplex
containing a T:G mismatch, homoduplex containing T:A match, and a
negative control. To construct the T:G heteroduplex plasmid, we used
EGFP3-11 (5-CGGGATCCACCGGTCGCCACCATGGTGAGCAATCG-3) and
EGFP 3-12 (5-CGATTGCTCACCGTGGTGGCGACCGGTGGATCCCGGGCC3) oligonucleotides. The homoduplex plasmid was constructed in the same
way as the heteroduplex plasmid except that the oligonucleotide EGFP3-12
was replaced with oligonucleotide EGFP 3-13 (5-CGATTGCTCACCATGGTGGCGACCGGTGGATCCCGGGCC-3). For negative control,

oligonucleotides were not used. Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated
and annealed to form a double-stranded DNA fragment with T:G mismatch
(heteroduplex) or T:A match (homoduplex). Two microliters of the
oligonucleotide mixture were mixed with 1 Ag of p95-1 larger fragment
and 40 U of T4 ligase. After overnight ligation, DNA was digested with
EcoRV, purified, and used for electroporations.
Electroporation. Parental cells, BCR/ABL-transformed cells, and BCR/
ABL-transformed cells pretreated with 1 Amol/L imatinib (Novartis Pharma
AG) for 24 h were mixed with T:G heterodimer or T:A homodimer and
electroporated at 280 V and 900 F using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). CD34+
human cells were electroporated at 220 V and 900 F. Expression of
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was evaluated 48 h after
electroporation by flow cytometry using EPICS XL (Beckman-Coulter, Inc.).
Calculation of relative EGFP expression. MMR efficiency in each cell
line was measured with relative EGFP expression as described by Lei et al.
(11). It was calculated according to the formula, relative EGFP expression =
(M  I M  N  I N)/(C  IC  N  I N), where M, N, and C are the
percentages of green cells for heteroduplex, negative control (mock
transfection), and homoduplex transfection, respectively. I M, I N, and
I C are the mean fluorescence intensities of positive cells for M, N, and C,
respectively. N  I N was omitted in the calculation when it was negligible.

Results
An assay using T:G mismatch–corrupted start codon of the
EGFP gene was used here to quantitatively measure MMR activity
in living cells (11). The mismatch can be corrected to T:A by MMR;
therefore, MMR activity is determined by flow cytometry
measuring the number of EGFP+ cells and the intensity of EGFP
expression (Fig. 1A). To control the transfection and transcription/
translation efficiencies, expression plasmid containing T:A match
in EGFP start codon was applied. MMR activity was reduced
f2-fold in BCR/ABL-positive BaF3 and 32Dcl3 cells compared
with parental counterparts (Fig. 1B). In addition, CD34+ cells from
CML patients displayed inhibition of MMR activity compared with
CD34+ cells obtained from healthy donors (Fig. 1B). The inhibitory
effect of BCR/ABL on MMR was dependent on ABL kinase because
pretreatment with imatinib restored MMR activity in leukemia cells
to the levels observed in parental counterparts (Fig. 1B).

Cancer Research

Recognition of a mismatch by MMR proteins usually induces
apoptosis by accumulation of p53 and p73, leading to activation of
caspase 3 (7). To determine if BCR/ABL kinase–mediated inhibition
of MMR activity is associated with abrogation of p53/p73-caspase
3-apoptosis pathway, parental and BCR/ABL-transformed 32Dcl3
cells were preincubated or not with O 6-benzylguanine to inhibit
O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase and then treated
with MNNG, a known mutagen and activator of MMR (12).
O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase may remove MNNGinduced base modifications before they are recognized by MMR;
therefore, abrogation of its enzymatic activity eliminates the
potential effect on MMR-dependent effects (13).
BCR/ABL-positive cells were resistant to MNNG compared with
parental counterparts (Fig. 2A). Pretreatment with O 6-benzylguanine did not significantly affect the sensitivity of leukemia and
normal cells to MNNG, suggesting that O 6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase does not play a major role here. As expected,
MNNG-treated BCR/ABL-positive cells displayed robust timedependent accumulation of p53 compared with the modest effect
detected in parental cells (Fig. 2B; ref. 14). Interestingly, MNNG
caused stimulation of p73 and activation of caspase 3 in parental
cells but not in BCR/ABL-transformed counterparts (Fig. 2B). In
concordance, immunofluorescence studies showed MNNG-induced
accumulation of p73 in the nuclei of parental but not BCR/ABLpositive cells (Fig. 2C).
Cells surviving the initial treatment and subsequently growing in
the presence of 1 Amol/L MNNG were plated in methylcellulose in
the presence or absence of 0.5 mmol/L ouabain. Ouabain, a Na+/K+
ATPase inhibitor, is toxic for cells, but amino acid substitutions due
to point mutations in the a1 subunit of the enzyme may cause
resistance to the toxin (15). The percentage of BCR/ABL-positive
clones resistant to ouabain was f15-fold higher than that of
parental clones (Fig. 3A). The same numbers of MNNG-resistant
parental and BCR/ABL-positive cells were used for clonogenic
assay, and the results were expressed as percentages of clonogenic

cells to exclude the possibility that increased mutation rate of BCR/
ABL-positive cells simply reflect their increased survivability. Point
mutations were detected in the a1 subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase gene
in the resistant clones with expected prevalence of G:C!A:T and
A:T!G:C transitions (Fig. 3B).

Discussion
Using the reporter plasmid where MMR can restore functional
EGFP gene by repairing T:G mismatch in the start codon (11), we
showed that BCR/ABL kinase inhibits MMR activity. T:G mismatch
was chosen because it might lead to T!C transition detected in
f25% of bcr/abl mutations in CML stem cell–enriched populations and be responsible for imatinib-resistant BCR/ABL kinase
variants, for example, Y253H and M351T (16).
T:G mismatch could be repaired by MMR or a mismatch-specific
thymidine DNA glycosylase (TDG; ref. 17). However, only MMRdependent pathway would create T:A match if the G is located in
the antisense strand, restore the EGFP start codon, and induce
EGFP expression. Repair of T:G mismatch by TDG would create the
C:G fixed mutation in the EGFP start codon that prevents
expression of the protein.
Reduced MMR activity reported in leukemia cells was usually
associated with down-regulation/loss of at least one of the MMR
proteins (18). However, expression of MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and
PMS2 proteins was not inhibited by BCR/ABL kinase in
hematopoietic cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and CML-CP
and CML-BC cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To study the biological effects of a negative influence of BCR/
ABL kinase on MMR, cells were challenged with MNNG, a mutagen
usually used to study MMR in vivo (12). MNNG produces a variety
of structurally diverse alkyl-DNA lesions, but O 6-methylguanine
and O 4-methylthymine are among the most frequent. These lesions
are very efficiently recognized by MMR, which triggers signaling to
apoptosis and excision removal of these lesions (7, 12). If not

Na+/K+ ATPase encoding resistance to ouabain. A,

repaired, replication may generate O 6-methylguanine:T and
O 4-methylthymine:G mispairs, eventually resulting in point
mutations.
BCR/ABL-positive leukemia cells proliferating in the presence of
MNNG did not display reduced expression of MMR proteins
(Supplementary Fig. S1A and C). Thus, it is unlikely that any effect
of BCR/ABL kinase on MMR was due to selection of clones with
low levels of MMR proteins. Interestingly, the assembly of MLH1PMS2, but not MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer on MNNG-induced DNA
lesions, was abrogated by BCR/ABL kinase in cell lines and CD34+
CML primary cells (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). These
observations suggest that BCR/ABL kinase induces posttranslational modifications of MMR proteins affecting their physiologic
response to mismatched bases.
Using MNNG as a mutagen inducing MMR-sensitive DNA lesions
and ouabain resistance as an indicator of mutagenesis in Na+/K+
ATPase, we showed that mutation rate was f15-fold higher in
BCR/ABL-positive cells than parental counterparts. More than 70%
of mutations in BCR/ABL cells were G:C!A:T and A:T!G:C
transitions, the typical phenotype caused by misrepair of
O 6-methylguanine and O 4-methylthymine lesions (19).
MMR pathway induces not only the repair but also apoptosis (7).
MMR-dependent apoptosis might be mediated by MSH2-MSH6–
dependent activation of p53 and MLH1-PMS2–dependent accumulation of p73, resulting in mitochondrial-dependent robust
activation of caspases 9 and 3. We showed that normal
hematopoietic cells treated with MNNG displayed classic MMRdependent apoptosis involving accumulation of p53 and p73, and
activation of caspase 3. However, although BCR/ABL-positive cells
accumulated p53, thus implicating an intact MSH2-MSH6 induction of apoptosis in leukemia cells, p73 remained inactive in

concordance with the defect of assembly of MLH1-PMS2 proteins
in leukemia cells. The lack of p73 accumulation in leukemia cells
was associated with lack of activation of caspase 3 and leukemia
cells survival.
In summary, reduced MMR activity in CML cells may be directly
responsible for generation of point mutations in bcr/abl kinase
sequence and in other genes such as p53 and Rb, causing
resistance to small molecule inhibitors and malignant progression
of the disease (2). This hypothesis is supported by the report that
imatinib-resistant BCR/ABL mutants were recovered from MMRdeficient bacteria (20). In addition, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, which
induced mutagenesis in MMR-deficient cells, generated imatinibresistant BCR/ABL mutants in experimental conditions (21).
Moreover, Msh2/ bone marrow cells infected by Abelson murine
leukemia virus acquire transforming phenotype and p53-inactivating point mutations with much higher frequency than Msh2 +/+
counterparts (22). It could be also postulated that impaired MMR
could facilitate point mutations acquired during unfaithful
nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination repair
in BCR/ABL-positive leukemias (5, 23). Thus, the precise effect of
BCR/ABL kinase on MMR pathways requires further studies.
