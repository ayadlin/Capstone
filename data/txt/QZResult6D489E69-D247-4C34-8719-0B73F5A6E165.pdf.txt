ABSTRACT
Inspite of effective treatment with imatinib (IM), chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) is still an incurable disease. Some patients became refractory because of IM
resistance. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been implicated a
role in promoting CML cells’ resistance against IM treatment. The detailed molecular
mechanisms, however, remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that BMSCs
increased the expression of FZD7 and activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in
CML cells. BMSCs from CML patients showed increased efficiency to accelerate CML
cell proliferation, enhance the drug resistance of K562 cells and up-regulate the
expression of FZD7. Antagonism of FZD7 expression by shRNA significantly suppressed
proliferation and increased IM sensitivity of CML cells co-cultured with BMSCs cells.
Our findings suggest that FZD7, involved in canonical Wnt signaling pathway, plays
a critical role in mediating BMSCs-dependent protection of CML cells, and potentially
provide a novel therapeutic target for CML.

INTRODUCTION

bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) appear to
be essential for CML cells survival and chemoresistance
[6]. However, the signaling pathway that mediates
the interaction of CML cells with BMSCs and causes
the chemotherapy resistance of CML cells is largely
unexplored.
Wnt/b-catenin signaling is highly evolutionarily
conserved and is involved in embryogenesis and the
maintenance of homeostasis in tissues by regulating
cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation,
survival, and angiogenesis [7]. The Wnt/b-catenin
signaling is initiated by binding of Wnt ligands to
frizzled transmembrane receptors (FZD) and low-density
lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRPs), resulting in
stabilization of β-catenin, which subsequently translocates
to the nucleus. Imported β-catenin forms transcriptional
complex with TCF/LEF to activate transcription of
downstream target genes, such as CD44, cyclin D1
and c-Myc, Survivin, and Trib2 [8–11]. Studies have
showed that BMSCs enhance nuclear translocation and
transcriptional activity of b-catenin in CML cells [12].
However, the molecular basis that how Wnt signaling
activity in CML cells is regulated by BMSCs remains
obscure.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal
myeloproliferative disease which originates from a
primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transformed
by BCR-ABL oncogene. The deregulated tyrosine
kinase activity of BCR-ABL protein leads to increased
proliferation and reduced apoptosis of undifferentiated
myeloid cells [1]. Imatinib mesylate (IM) and other
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been highly efficient
in treatment of CML. However, a significant proportion of
patients do not obtain expected effectiveness, while some
other CML patients become refractory to further treatment
[2]. Moreover, cessation of drug treatment leads to
disease recurrence in most CML patient. Minimal residual
disease (MRD), retained in patients even when they reach
complete remission, may be the source of relapse in CML
patients after TKI discontinuation [3, 4].
Some evidences suggest that disease relapse and
treatment resistance in CML patients are largely due to
the protection of leukemia cells by various components of
the bone marrow microenvironment. Especially indirect
communication through extracellularly secreted growth
factors [5] and direct contact between leukemia cells and

To further confirm our results, relative FZD7 mRNA
levels of BMMCs from the 55 newly diagnosed adult CML
patients and 20 healthy controls were also determined by
real-time RT-PCR. In spite of the wide individual variance,
mean levels of FZD7 were significantly up-regulated in
the CML patients, compared with the normal controls
(p  = 0.012) (Supplementary Figure S4).

In this study, we found that BMSCs could increase
the expression of Frizzled-7 (FZD7) and subsequently
activate Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway in CML
cells. Co-cultured CML cells with  BMSCs showed upregulated FZD7 expression, increased cell proliferation
and decreased drug sensitivity, which could be reversed
by FZD7 knockdown with shRNA. Our findings suggest
that FZD7 plays a critical role in mediating BMSCspromoted CML cells proliferation and drug resistance
through Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, our
work provide a foundation of FZD7 to be a novel therapy
target for CML.

FZD7 is further up-regulated in IM-resistant
CML CD34+ cells
To investigate the expression changes of FZD7 in
response to TKIs therapy, we measured the mRNA and
protein level of FZD7 in IM-sensitive (IMS) patients and
IM-resistant (IMR) patients. As expected, FZD7 mRNA
levels showed higher expression level in CML CD34+
cells from IMR patients (n = 7) than IMS patients (n = 9)
(Figure 2B). Western blot analysis also revealed that FZD7
protein levels were significantly elevated in IMR CML
CD34+ cells, compared to their counterparts (Figure 2C).
These findings raised the possibility that FZD7 could
contribute to the drug resistance of IM in CML patients.

RESULTS
FZD7 along with β-catenin and its downstream
melocules was up-regulated in CML cells
following contact with BMSCs
Studies showed that co-culturing with BMSCs
significantly inhibited CML cells’ apoptosis and protected
CML cells from TKIs exposure [12]. To explore the key
molecules that mediate the interaction between BMSCs and
CML cells, especially those facilitate BMSCs-dependent
CML preservation, we built a system where CML cells
were co-cultured with BMSCs derived from 3 initially
diagnosed CML patients or 2 healthy donors. Western blot
analysis showed that co-culturing with normal BMSCs
or CML-BMSCs sharply increased FZD7, β-catenin, and
Wnt downstream target MDR1 expression in K562 cells
(Figure 1A. left) and primary CML cells (Figure 1A, right),
respectively. Interestingly, the BMSCs from CML patiens
exhibited higher efficiency to promote the expression
levels of these proteins. In agreement with the western blot
data, real-time RT-PCR showed that co-culture with normal
MSCs and CML-MSCs sharply increased Wnt signaling
target genes FZD7, MDR1, Survivin, CD44, c-Myc, and
Trib2 mRNA expression in K562 cells (Figure 1B). These
results indicated that FZD7 might take part in the crosstalk
between CML cells and BMSCs.

Down-regulation of FZD7 suppressed the
proliferation of CML cells
We supposed FZD7 was crucial in preventing the
apoptosis of CML cells or promoting the proliferation of
CML cells, thus loss of FZD7 should suppress the growth
of CML cells. To test this possibility, we transduced
CML cells with short hairpin RNAs that target FZD7
(ShFZD7–1 and ShFZD7–2) or control (ShCtrl) for
3 days. Transfection  efficiency was more tnan 90%
evaluated by fluorescence microscope (Supplementary
Figure S5). Real-time RT-PCR and western blot showed
that both ShFZD7–1 and ShFZD7–2 could efficiently
decrease FZD7 mRNA and protein level in K562 cells
(Figure 3A). We observed that down-regulation of
FZD7 suppressed cell growth of K562 cells, compared
with negative control (Figure 3B). FZD7 knockdown
also resulted less and smaller colony formation of K562
cells (61 ± 14.1 versus 22.6 ± 11.5 for ShFZD7–1, and
21.2 ± 10.1 for ShFZD7–2) (Figure 3C).
We next explored the underlying mechanisms of
proliferative inhibition upon FZD7 down-regulation in
CML cells by detecting the cell cycle with FACS. As
shown in Figure 3E and 3F, down-regulation of FZD7
significantly increased the ratio of cells in G0/G1 phase,
and simultaneously reduced the ratio of cells undergoing
S phase. To further identified genes that are responsible
for the cell cycle arrest caused by FZD7 knockdown,
representative cell cycle regulators were studied. As
shown in Figure 3G, p27 was significantly increased,
while cyclin D1 was noticeably downregulated when
K562 cells were treated with FZD7 shRNAs. These results
provided evidences that FZD7 down-regulation suppressed
proliferation of K562 cells by mediating G0/G1 arrest.

Up-regulation of FZD receptors was observed in
CD34+ cells of CML patients
As FZD7 was highly up-regulated when CML cells
were co-cultured with BMSCs, we examined the potential
role of FZD receptors in CML. First we investigated the
mRNA levels of FZD family in primary CML CD34+
cells by real-time RT-PCR. In normal bone marrow
(NBM) CD34+ cells, all FZD genes were detectable, but
the expression level were variable between genes, with
relatively highest expression level of FZD6 and FZD7.
More importantly, two FZD genes, FZD4 and FZD7 were
differentially expressed in CML CD34+ cells compared
to NBM CD34+ cells, while FZD7 showed the highest
elevation (Figure 2A).

Down-regulation of FZD7 sensitized CML cells
to IM

ShFZD7 enhanced apoptosis induced by IM in K562
cells (Figure  4B  and  4C). We further confirmed our
results by detecting hallmarks of apoptosis, including the
cleavage activation of caspase-3 and PARP-1. The cleaved
caspase-3 and PARP-1 were significantly increased in
K562 cells when FZD7 was knocked down (Figure 4D).
Primary cells from one CML patient was transduced
with ShFZD7–1, ShFZD7–2 or ShCtrl and then treated
with 5 μM IM for 48 hrs. The cell apoptosis was assessed
by annexin V-APC/PI double-staining. The flow cytometry
results showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells were
37.6 ± 8.09% and 40.9 ± 7.48% in ShFZD7–1 and ShFZD7–2
transduced cells, respectively, versus 22.3  ±  6.40% in
ShCtrl transduced cells (P < 0.01, Figure 4E and 4F). Taken
together, our results demonstrated that knockdown of FZD7
increased the sensitivity of CML cells to IM.

As stated above, FZD7 levels were up-regulated
in IM-resistant CD34+ CML cells. One possibility
to explain this phenomenon is that FZD7 could be a
negative regulator of the sensitivity of CML to IM. To
test this possibility, we explored whether knockdown
of endogenous FZD7 could reverse the IM-resistance
induced by BMSCs in CML cells. As shown in Figure 4A,
we found down-regulation of FZD7 enhanced the
inhibitory effects of IM against K562 cells, and the
IC50 (drug concentration leads to 50% decrease of cell
viability) values of ShFZD7–1, ShFZD7–2 and ShCtrl
were 0.103 ± 0.016, 0.072 ± 0.026 and 0.318 ± 0.056 μM,
respectively (P < 0.01). Similarly, we also found

Down-regulation of FZD7 abrogated IM
resistance induced by BMSCs

with negative controls (P < 0.01). Next, we determined the
effect of FZD7 on IM-induced apoptosis in co-cultured
K562 cells by flow cytometry after annexin V/PI staining
(Figure 5B). ShFZD7 or ShCtrl transduced-K562 cells were
co-cultured with normal BMSCs, and exposed to IM for 48
hrs. The mean apoptotic rates of ShFZD7 or ShCtrl group
were 35.1 ± 6.1% and 18.6 ± 4.1%, respectively. The mean
apoptotic rates of K562 cells transduced with ShFZD7–2
and ShCtrl after treated with IM in the presence of CML
BMSCs were 32.9 ± 6.1% and 13.1 ± 3.9%, respectively
(Figure 5C). These results indicated that FZD7 downregulation reversed IM resistance induced by BMSCs.

To further study whether altered response of
leukemic cells to IM by BMSCs was due to the activation
of FZD7/Wnt/β-catenin signaling, FZD7 was downregulated by shRNA lentiviral particles in K562 cells, and
then cell survival of co-cultured K562 cells was examined.
Control or FZD7 shRNA-transduced K562 cells were
co-cultured with BMSCs and exposed to IM for 48 hrs.
As shown in Figure 5A, K562 with FZD7 knocked down
exhibited significantly higher susceptibility to IM compared

Down-regulation of FZD7 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway and abrogates its activation
induced by BMSCs

the expression of CD44 and c-Myc in K562 cells were
significantly decreased when FZD7 was knocked down
(Figure 6C and 6D).
We next analyzed the possible mechanisms of
restoration of sensitivity to chemotherapy of K562 cells by
down-regulation of FZD7 following contact with BMSCs.
Western blot results showed that when FZD7 was downregulated in K562 cells following contact with BMSCs,
the expression of FZD7, β-catenin, and MDR1 was still
remarkably decreased (Figure 7A). we further examined
the mRNA expression levels of FZD7, Wnt downstream
gene MDR1 and CD44 in transduced K562 cells after coculturing with CML or normal BMSCs. We found that
FZD7, MDR1 and CD44 mRNA levels were markedly
reduced by real-time qRT-PCR (Figure 7B). These results
implied that FZD7 played an important role in BMSCsmediated apoptotic resistance by activating Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway.

FZD7 is known as the ligand receptor in the
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is involved in
the chemoresistance of CML cells. We supposed that
FZD7 effected on CML cells through Wnt/β-catenin
signal pathway. Firstly we detected the activity of Wnt
signaling following down-regulation of FZD7 in CML
cells Our results showed that β-catenin in both nuclear
and cytoplasm were attenuated by ShFZD7 comparing
with ShCtrl (Figure 6A). TOPflash luciferase activity was
also found to be markedly reduced by ShFZD7 compared
to negative control (Figure 6B). We then assessed
whether expression of the canonical Wnt pathway target
genes (e.g. c-Myc and CD44) were impaired by FZD7
inhibition. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR revealed that

DISCUSSION

interestingly, FZD7 was up-regulated by BMSCs, and
BMSCs from CML patients showed increased efficiency
to up-regulate the expression of FZD7 along with
increment of β-catenin and Wnt target molecules such
as MDR1, c-Myc, and CD44 in CML cells. As we have
known that the interaction between BMSCs and leukemia
cells may trigger molecular changes of some important
signal pathways that lead to leukemia, such as Notch
signaling [18]. This is the first experimental evidences that
signals from the stromal microenvironment induce FZD7
expression in CML cells. Our data indicated that external
signals from BMSCs may have an important role in the
preserve of CML cells.
FZD7 is reported to promote the growth of
several tumors. In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, the
functional interaction between Wnt3 and FZD7 enhances

FZD7 has been demonstrated as a critical receptor
of the Wnt signaling and involves in tumorigenesis and
metastasis in many cancer types. The expression level
of FZD7 was found up-regulated in several malignant
tumors, such as colorectal cancer, hepatocellular
carcinoma, esophageal cancer, lung cancer and gastric
cancer, etc [14, 15]. Elevated levels of FZD7 protein in
human breast cancer were associated with unfavorable
prognosis and progressive stages of disease [16, 17]. In
our study, we found that the expression of FZD7 was upregulated in CML patients compared with normal controls.
What’s more, the expression level of FZD7 in IMR CML
cells was significant higher that IMS cells, suggesting that
FZD7 may take part in the drug resistance of CML. More

proliferative rate [19]. In triple negative breast cancer,
FZD7 shRNA reduces cell proliferation and colony
formation [20]. In Xenopus laevis, different thresholds
of Wnt-FZD7 activity coordinate with progenitor cell
fate and proliferation rate of endoderm progenitor cells
[21]. As FZD7 was up-regulated in CML cells, we
down-regulated its expression by shRNA to evaluate
the biological effect. We found that down-regulation of
FZD7 impaired cell proliferation in CML cell line by
increasing G0/G1 phase and decreasing S phase cells,
and restored the sensitivity of CML cells to IM. It was
the first time that the effect of FZD7 had been explored
in CML. We further found knockdown of FZD7 in CML
cells decreased protein level of β-catenin, especially
in the nuclear localization, inhibiting TCF luciferase
activity, suggesting the following event responsible for
the effect.

Targeted therapy of CML using TKI have greatly
improved the survival of patients. However, it remains
incurable. Chomel et al. demonstrated the long-term
persistence of a considerable amount of BCR-ABLexpressing stem cells even in the absence of relapse
[22]. LSCs are known to be genetically unstable and
less responsive to TKI treatments, and are of critical
importance in mediating TKI resistance [23]. The bone
marrow microenviroment contributes to the persistence
of LSCs. The bone marrow niche may provide survival
factors to CML stem cells in the context of LSC/
niche cross-talk. For example, Zhang et al. found
that N-cadherin–mediated adhesion played an important
role in protection of CML stem/progenitor cells from TKI
treatment by BM MSCs [12]. Recently the contribution of
leukemia-induced alterations in the BM microenvironment
also attracts lots of attention. CML BMSCs were

demonstrated to reduce the expression of normal BM,
influenced the normal stem cell niche, causing alteration
in the microenvironmental factors [24, 25]. Leukemia BM
decreased CXCL12 expression  and up-regulated G-CSF,
IL-1α, MIP-1β, and MIP-2, compared to normal BMSCs
[26]. In addition, mice with BCR-ABL-transformed
leukemia exhibit analogous alterations of BMSCs and
osteoblastic cells along with their supporting effects on
leukemogenesis [27, 28]. These studies give rise to the
concept of “leukemia-induced microenvironment” [29].
Here, we also found an interaction between the bone
marrow micrienviroment and leukemia cells partially
mediated by FZD7. BMSCs from CML patients was
shown to be more efficient to up-regulate FZD7/β-catenin
siganling in CML cells than normal BMSCs, thus to
accelerate proliferation, enhance IM resistance. This
indicated that remodeled BMSCs by leukemia provided
more survival signals to fuel the growth of leukemia cells
and contribute to the IM resistance. Some scientists are

trying to overcome IM resistance by targeting oncogenic
kinases by different mechanisms such as combined TKI
with geldanamycin(GA) or JAK2 inhibitor [30, 31]. Our
experiment may provide another approach by combination
of TKI with FZD7 inhibitor.
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays
important role in pathogenesis and progression of CML.
Increased activity of Wnt/β-catenin pathway was correlated
with poor response to imatinib and LSCs transformation
in blast crisis CML [32, 33] . In addition, β-catenin
deletion in mice caused a profound reduction in the risk
of CML induced by BCR-ABL [34]. Hu et al. found that
β-catenin was essential for survival and self-renewal
of LSCs [35]. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of
b-catenin contributed to the apoptosis of imatinib-resistant
leukemia stem cells in CML [36]. Potential mechanisms
underlying increased b-catenin in CML cells include
BCR-ABLmediated b-catenin phosphorylation [37] and
GSK3β inactivation [38], leading to protein stabilization of

β-catenin. Here we reported a new mechanism in regard to
the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in CML.
We found FZD7 was overexpressed in CML cells in a coculture system with BMSCs cells, resulting in up-regulated
b-catenin, activated Wnt signaling and increased resistance

to IM, which could be eliminated by antagonism of FZD7
expression. Our study suggested that FZD7 played an
important role in the cross-talk between BMSCs and CML
cells, indicating FZD7 could be a potential therapeutic
target for CML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

were washed with FBS free medium, and K562 or primary
CML cells were seeded onto BMSC monolayers at 4 × 106
cells per mL in RPMI 1640. Co-cultured K562 cells
were separated from BMSCs using a standardized
wash procedure. Detail methods was shown in the
Supplementary Data.

Material and cell lines
K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in an
incubator maintained at 37°C in an atmosphere containing
5% CO2. Primary antibodies for FZD7 were purchased
from Abcam (Austin, TX), those for β-catenin, MDR1,
caspase 3, and cyclin D1 were purchased from CST
(Beverly, MA), that for b-actin was from Sigma-Aldrich
(St Louis, MO), those for PARP-1 and P27 were from
Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). All secondary antibodies
were obtained from Li-Cor Biosciences (Lincoln, USA).

Plasmids and lentiviral particles production
The target shRNA sequences for FZD7 were
chemically synthesized and cloned into pLVTHM
lentiviral vector. Hek293T cells were co-transfected with
a mixture of pLVTHM-shFZD7–1, pLVTHM-shFZD7–2
or pLVTHM, and psPAX2, pMD2.G to package
lentiviral particles. Detailed methods were shown in the
Supplementary Data.

Clinical samples

Colony formation in soft agarose gel, MTT assay,
cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assay

Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) of 55
initially diagnosed CML patients and 20 healthy donors
were obtained after informed consent at Qilu Hospital of
Shandong University from May 2011 to December 2012.
The detailed clinical information of the 55 patients is
are available in Supplementary Table S1. Bone marrow
samples from another 16 newly diagnosed CML patients
prior to TKIs therapy and 6 healthy donors were taken
after informed consent. Subsequent imatinib sensitive
(IMS, n = 9) patients achieved complete hematologic
remission within 3 months, major cytogenetic remission
within 12 months, and complete cytogenetic remission
within 18 months, based on the European Leukemia Net
treatment guidelines [13]. Conversely, imatinib resistant
(IMR, n =7) patients did not achieve these response criteria
or had evidence of loss of response later. Mononuclear
cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO) density gradient centrifugation and enriched
using a human CD34 MicroBead Kit (Miltenyi Biotec,
Germany). All the study protocols involved with patients
and healthy donors were approved by the Medical Ethics
Committee of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University,
Jinan, China, and written informed consents were obtained
from all patients and healthy donors.

Data.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was
applied to extract total RNA from cells or patient samples.
Reverse transcription was performed using M-MLV
reverse transcriptase cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, Japan).
Real-time RT-PCR was carried out on ABI 7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR System (Foster City, CA) with SYBRGreen PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Japan). Melting curves
analysis was applied to guarantee the specificity of
amplification. A comparative CT method (2-ΔΔCT) was used
to analyze the gene expression level. β-actin or GAPDH
was used as the internal control. The primers for real-time
RT-PCR are available in Table 1.

Western blot
The extraction and isolation of nuclear and
cytosolic protein were by Nuclear and Cytoplasmic
Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime, China) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. For western blot analysis,
cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and solubilized in
RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, China) containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). 30μg protein
sample were separated on 10% SDS–polyacrylamide
gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.
Membranes were blocked in 3% non-fat milk for 1 hour
and incubated in primary antibodiesovernight. After
secondary antibody incubation, signals were detected
and analyzed by the Li-Cor Odyssey imaging system
(Lincoln, NE).

BMSCs and co-culture
Bone marrow samples used for BMSCs cultures
were aspirates of healthy donors and CML patients with
written informed consent. Mononuclear cells obtained
after Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation were
suspended in MesenPro RS Medium (GIBCO BRL) at
37°C and 5% CO2. BM non-adherent cells were removed
after 1 days and the culture medium was replaced every
3–4 days until a confluent monolayer had developed
(usually after 1–2 weeks). Passage 3 or 4 BMSCs were
used for the coculture experiments. Adherent BMSCs
