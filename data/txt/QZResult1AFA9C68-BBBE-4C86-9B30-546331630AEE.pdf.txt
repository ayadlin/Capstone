Abstract
Lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–
activating mutations responds favorably to the EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. However, 25% to 30%
of patients with EGFR-activating mutations show intrinsic
resistance, and the responders invariably acquire resistance to
gefitinib. Here, we showed that hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF), a ligand of MET oncoprotein, induces gefitinib
resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells with EGFR-activating
mutations by restoring the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt
signaling pathway via phosphorylation of MET, but not EGFR
or ErbB3. Strong immunoreactivity for HGF in cancer cells
was detected in lung adenocarcinoma patients harboring
EGFR-activating mutations, but no T790M mutation or MET
amplification, who showed intrinsic or acquired resistance to
gefitinib. The findings indicate that HGF-mediated MET
activation is a novel mechanism of gefitinib resistance in
lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR-activating mutations. Therefore, inhibition of HGF-MET signaling may be a considerable
strategy for more successful treatment with gefitinib. [Cancer

Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies and
the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Non–smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for nearly 80% of lung cancer
cases. The median survival of metastatic NSCLC is 8 to 10 months
when treated with the most active combination of conventional
chemotherapeutic agents (1, 2). Recent therapeutic strategies for
NSCLC have focused on the development of molecular targeted
therapies.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of a
family of closely related growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases,
which includes EGFR (ErbB1), HER2/neu (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3),

and HER4 (ErbB4; ref. 3). As EGFR is expressed in the majority of
cases of NSCLC, it is an attractive target for the development of
therapeutic agents. The small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, including gefitinib and erlotinib, have been evaluated in
clinical trials for patients with NSCLC. Both agents cause partial
responses in 10% to 20% of all NSCLC patients (4, 5).
Activating mutations in EGFR have been found in a proportion
of NSCLC (6, 7). Almost 90% of the activating mutations in EGFR
consist of in-frame deletions in exon 19 and L858R point mutation
in exon 21. These mutations are predominantly found in female,
nonsmoking, adenocarcinoma patients and in patients of East
Asian origin, and are associated with favorable response to the
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib (8). Multiple
prospective trials have shown a response rate of 70% to 75%
for patients with tumors harboring these mutations (8, 9). This
indicates, however, that another 25% to 30% of the patients are
intrinsically resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors although
their tumors harbor activating mutations in EGFR. In addition,
even patients who show a dramatic response to initial treatment
also develop acquired resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors almost without exception after varying periods of time (8).
To overcome the intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it is necessary to clarify the molecular
mechanisms of the resistance. Recently, two mechanisms, secondsite point mutation that substitutes methionine for threonine at
position 790 (T790M) in EGFR (10, 11) and amplification of MET
proto-oncogene (12, 13), which contribute to acquired resistance to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been reported. T790 is
located in the ATP-binding pocket of the catalytic region of EGFR
and seems to be critical for the binding of erlotinib and gefitinib
(10). On acquisition of a secondary T790M mutation, the bulkier
methionine residue prevents EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor from
binding with EGFR tyrosine kinases. On the other hand, MET
amplification has been shown to restore the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway mediated by ErbB3 transactivation
and thereby induces acquired resistance to gefitinib. T790M
secondary mutation and MET amplification are found in f50%
and 20%, respectively, of patients acquiring resistance to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (8, 10–13). However, the mechanisms of
intrinsic resistance and the other 30% of cases of acquired
resistance are still unknown.
The MET gene encodes a high-affinity receptor for hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF; refs. 14, 15). HGF, originally cloned as a
mitogenic protein for hepatocytes (16), specifically activates MET
receptor tyrosine kinase and induces pleiotropic biological effects

in a wide variety of cells, including mitogenic, motogenic, morphogenic, and antiapoptotic activities (17, 18). As HGF is expressed
in lung cancer cells and stromal cells (17–19), we investigated
whether HGF is involved in gefitinib resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells with EGFR-activating mutations. In contrast with
MET amplification, we found that HGF induces resistance to
gefitinib by restoring Akt phosphorylation independently of ErbB3
and that HGF can be involved in intrinsic resistance as well as
acquired resistance to gefitinib in lung adenocarcinoma patients
with EGFR-activating mutations.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. The EGFR-mutant human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines PC-9 and HCC827 were purchased from Immuno-

Biological Laboratories Co. and American Type Culture Collection,
respectively. These cell lines were extensively characterized (12, 20, 21).
Human lung squamous cell carcinoma, EBC-1 (22), was purchased from the
Health Science Research Resources Bank (Japan Health Sciences Foundation). PC-9, HCC827, and EBC-1 cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin,
100 units/mL streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L glutamine.
Gefitinib was obtained from AstraZeneca. Recombinant HGF and antiHGF antibody for immunohistochemistry were prepared as reported
previously (23, 24). Recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were obtained from Invitrogen.
Transforming growth factor a (TGF-a) was from Biosource. Goat antihuman HGF neutralizing antibody and control goat IgG were purchased
from R&D Systems.
Sequence analyses. We searched for mutations in the EGFR gene in
lung adenocarcinoma cell lines by sequencing the cDNAs synthesized from

Figure 1. HGF induces gefitinib resistance

induced gefitinib resistance of PC-9 and
HCC827 cells with EGFR -activating

with increasing concentrations of gefitinib
and/or HGF, and cell growth was
determined after 72 h of treatment by MTT
assay. B, pretreatment of HGF with
anti-HGF antibody abrogated HGF-induced
resistance of HCC827 cells to gefitinib.
HGF (20 ng/mL) was pretreated with
control IgG (2 Ag/mL) or anti-HGF antibody
(2 Ag/mL) at 37jC for 1 h. The resultant
solutions were added to the cultures of
tumor cells with or without gefitinib
(300 nmol/L). Cell growth was determined
in the same way as in A. *, P < 0.01
(one-way ANOVA). C, HGF was most
potent in induction of gefitinib resistance
of PC-9 and HCC827 cells. PC-9 and
HCC827 cells were incubated with or
without gefitinib and/or 50 ng/mL of HGF,
EGF, TGF-a, or IGF-I. Cell growth was
determined after 72 h of treatment. The
percentage of growth is shown relative to
untreated controls.

mRNAs. Gene-specific primer pairs were designed to cover the region from
exons 18 to 22 of EGFR , which included all mutations reported to date.
Primers for PCR were 5¶-CCTCTTGCTGCTGGTGGT-3¶ and 5¶-GATTCCGTCATATGGCTTGG-3¶. PCR was done in reaction mixtures containing cDNA,
1 Ex Taq buffer, 0.2 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphate mixture, 1.25
units of Ex Taq HS Enzyme (TaKaRa), and 0.5 Amol/L of forward and reverse
primers in a volume of 50 AL. PCR cycling parameters were one cycle of
94jC for 7 min; 30 cycles of 94jC for 30 s, 58jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 1 min;
followed by one cycle of 72jC for 7 min. The resulting PCR products were
purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), followed by
bidirectional dye-terminator fluorescent sequencing. All sequencing reactions were done in both forward and reverse directions with two primers for
PCR and sequencing primer designed within the amplicon. The sequencing
primer was 5¶-ATGTCCGGGAACACAAAGAC-3¶. Sequencing fragments were
detected by capillary electrophoresis using an ABI Prism 3700 DNA
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). All mutations were confirmed by examination of at least two independently derived PCR products.
Quantitative PCR for analysis of MET genomic amplification.
Quantitative PCR was done on genomic DNA purified with a QIAamp
DNA Mini kit (Qiagen). Primers and probe used for MET were (5¶ to 3¶)
F-TGTTGCCAAGCTGTATTCTGTTTAC, R-TCTCTGAATTAGAGCGATGTTGACA, and FAM-TGGATAATTGTGTCTTTCTCTAG-MGBNFQ (22). Primers
and probe for the single-copy reference gene RNase P, which encodes the
RNA moiety of the enzyme RNase P, were obtained from Applied Biosystems, as well as TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix. Reactions were
done in quadruplicate with 20 ng of genomic DNA, primers at 900 nmol/L,
and probes at 250 nmol/L under standard thermocycling conditions (2 min
at 50jC; 10 min at 95jC; 40 cycles of 15 s at 92jC and 1 min at 60jC). Data
were normalized to RNase P.
Cell proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was measured using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) dye reduction
method (25). Tumor cells (2  103/100 AL/well) were plated into each well
of 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. After 24-h incubation, several
concentrations of gefitinib, cytokines, and/or culture supernatants were
added to each well, and incubation was continued for a further 72 h. Then,
50 AL of MTT solution (2 mg/mL; Sigma) were added to all wells, and
incubation was continued for a further 2 h. The media containing MTT
solution were removed, and the dark blue crystals were dissolved by adding
100 AL of DMSO. The absorbance was measured with a microplate reader at
test and reference wavelengths of 550 and 630 nm, respectively. The
percentage of growth is shown relative to untreated controls. Each
experiment was done at least in triplicate, and thrice independently.
Cell apoptosis assay. Cell apoptosis induced by gefitinib was detected
with an Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences
Pharmingen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly,
aliquots of 5  105 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes and incubated for
24 h at 37jC. On the following day, various concentrations of gefitinib and/
or HGF (20 ng/mL), diluted in culture media, were added to the dishes and
incubated for an additional 36 h. After trypsinization and gently washing
cells once with medium, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then
resuspended, and aliquots of 1  105 cells were transferred into new 5-mL
culture tubes in 100 AL of 1  binding buffer. Then 5 AL of Annexin V-FITC
and 5 AL of propidium iodide were added to the resuspended cells. After
incubation at room temperature for 15 min in the dark, 400 AL of binding
buffer were added to the resuspended cells. The analysis was done on a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).
Antibodies and Western blotting. Tumor cells were incubated in 10 mL
RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS in the presence or absence of HGF and/or
gefitinib. Then, cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer containing phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail and proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), and the protein
concentrations were determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit
(Pierce Biotechnology). Aliquots of 500 Ag of total proteins were
immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies; immune complexes
were recovered with Protein G-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories). For
Western blotting analysis, immunoprecipitates or 40 Ag of total protein
were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) electrophoresis and the
proteins were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes

membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with speciesspecific horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with SuperSignal West Dura Extended
Duration Substrate Enhanced Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology). Each experiment was done at least thrice independently.

Assay for RNA interference and HGF gene transfection. Duplexed
Stealth RNAi (Invitrogen) against MET and ErbB3 and Stealth RNAi
Negative Control Low GC Duplex #3 (Invitrogen) were used for RNA
interference (RNAi) assay. The full-length HGF cDNA cloned into an
expression vector (26) was used for HGF gene transfection assay. One day
before transfection, aliquots of 2  104 tumor cells in 400 AL of antibioticfree medium were plated on 24-well plates. After incubation for 24 h, the
cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA; 50 pmol) or
scramble RNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (1 AL) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. After 24-h incubation, the cells were washed
with PBS and incubated with or without gefitinib (300 nmol/L) and/or
recombinant human HGF (20 ng/nL) for an additional 72 h in antibioticcontaining medium. Cell proliferation was measured with a Cell Counting
Kit-8 (Dojin) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Knockdown of MET and ErbB3 was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) analysis. The sequences of siRNAs were as follows: MET,
5¶-UCCAGAAGAUCAGUUUCCUAAUUCA-3¶ and 5¶-UGAAUUAGGAAACUGAUCUUCUGGA-5¶; ErbB3 , 5¶-GGCCAUGAAUGAAUUCUCUACUCUA-3¶

and 5¶-UAGAGUAGAGAAUUCAUUCAUGGCC-3¶. Each experiment was
done at least in triplicate, and thrice independently.
HGF production. Cells (1  106) were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10%
FBS for 24 h. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 48 h in
RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. Then, culture medium was harvested and
centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored at 70jC until analysis. For
determination of HGF, ELISA was done in accordance with the
manufacturer’s recommended procedures (Immunis HGF EIA, Institute of
Immunology, Tokyo, Japan). All samples were run in triplicate. Color
intensity was measured at 450 nm with a spectrophotometric plate reader.
Growth factor concentrations were determined by comparison with
standard curves. The detection limit was 0.1 ng/mL.
Patients. In total, 20 tumor specimens with EGFR-activating mutations
were obtained from 16 lung adenocarcinoma patients, who provided
written informed consent, at the Tokushima University Hospital (Tokushima, Japan) and Aichi Cancer Center Hospital (Nagoya, Japan) in
Institutional Review Board–approved studies. Of the 16 patients, 3 patients
showed intrinsic resistance and other 13 patients showed partial response

to initial gefitinib treatment. For the 3 patients who showed intrinsic
resistance and 8 of the 13 patients who had shown partial response, tumor
specimens were obtained only before gefitinib treatment. The other 5 had
shown partial response to gefitinib during initial treatment but showed
signs of tumor regrowth (i.e., acquired resistance) while still receiving
gefitinib. For 3 of those 5 patients, we were able to obtain pairs of tumor
specimens before treatment and after the development of acquired resistance to gefitinib. In the other 2 patients, tumor specimens were available
only after the development of acquired resistance to gefitinib. Of 6 tumors
from 5 patients who showed acquired resistance, 4 tumors had T790M
second mutation. No MET amplification was detected in any of these
tumors.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical staining
was carried out on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of
lung adenocarcinoma specimens. Sections of 5-Am thickness were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol.
For detection of MET, sections were retrieved by microwave treatment for
10 min, with immersion in antigen retrieval medium (Immunosaver, Nissin
EM Ltd.). After blocking the endogenous peroxidase activity with 3%
aqueous H2O2 solution for 10 min, the sections were treated with 5% normal
horse serum. The sections were then reacted with primary antibodies (antiHGF antibody, 5 Ag/mL; anti–total MET antibody, 1:100 dilution) at 4jC
overnight. The primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-HGF
antibody (24) and rabbit polyclonal anti-MET antibody (IBL Ltd.). After
washing with PBS, the sections were treated with biotin-conjugated
antirabbit IgG (1:200 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature and allowed
to react for 30 min with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) using a
Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). The DAB (3,3¶-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride) Liquid System (DakoCytomation) was used to detect

immunostaining. Omission of primary antibodies served as negative
control.
Evaluation of immunohistochemical results. Immunoreactivities
were evaluated as follows, in accordance with the method of Nakamura
and colleagues (27). Immunoreactivities for HGF were evaluated as either
high or low, with a cutoff value of 50% of positively stained cancer cells.
Immunoreactivities for MET protein were evaluated as follows: , complete
absence of staining or only focal weak staining; 1+, weak to moderate
staining in <40% of cancer cells; 2+, weak to moderate staining in at least
40% of cancer cells; 3+, strong staining in at least 10% of cancer cells, among
the specimens with weak to moderate staining in at least 40% of cancer
cells. Weak to moderate staining was defined as staining similar to or
weaker than the staining of normal bronchial epithelium; strong staining
was defined as staining clearly more than intense than that of normal
bronchial epithelium. Immunoreactivity was evaluated independently by
two investigators (S.Y. and W.W.). Cases with discrepancies were jointly
reevaluated and a consensus was reached.
Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of differences was
analyzed by one-way ANOVA. In cases in which the P values for the overall
comparisons were <0.05, post hoc pairwise comparisons were done with the
Newman-Keuls Multiple comparison test. Statistical analyses were done
using GraphPad Prism ver. 4.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).

deletions in exon 19 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Consistent with a
previous report (12), neither PC-9 nor HCC827 cells had MET
amplification or T790M mutation in exon 20 of EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S2 and data not shown). Both PC-9 and HCC827 cells
were highly sensitive to gefitinib. HGF alone did not affect
proliferation of PC-9 cells, but it slightly stimulated the proliferation of HCC827 cells. Under these experimental conditions, HGF
induced resistance of PC-9 and HCC827 cells to gefitinib in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1A). The effect of HGF was abrogated by
pretreatment of HGF with anti-HGF neutralizing antibody but
not control IgG (Fig. 1B). In parallel experiments, HGF did not
induce resistance of PC-9 or HCC827 cells to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs such as carboplatin, gemcitabine, docetaxel, or
pemetrexed (Supplementary Fig. S3). We also explored the effects
of other cytokines reported to be related to gefitinib sensitivity.
EGF (28), TGF-a (29), and IGF-I (30) tended to promote resistance
of PC-9 cells to gefitinib, but their effects were marginal (Fig. 1C).
Gefitinib has been shown to induce apoptosis of PC-9 and HCC827
cells (12, 20). Whereas HGF alone had no effect on induction of
apoptosis of PC-9 or HCC827 cells, it prevented gefitinib-induced
apoptosis of these cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
HGF-induced gefitinib resistance is mediated by restoring
phosphorylation of Akt, but not EGFR or ErbB3. MET
amplification has been shown to restore the PI3K/Akt pathway
mediated by ErbB3 transactivation and thereby induces acquired
resistance to gefitinib (12). To investigate the molecular mechanism by which HGF induces gefitinib resistance, we examined the
phosphorylation of MET, EGFR, ErbB3, and the PI3K/Akt pathway
by Western blotting. PC-9 and HCC827 cells expressed EGFR,
ErbB3, and MET proteins, and these molecules were phosphorylated at various levels. These receptors and downstream Akt and
ERK1/2 were also phosphorylated. Gefitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB3, Akt, and ERK1/2, but not MET. HGF
alone did not affect phosphorylation of EGFR or ErbB3, whereas it
stimulated phosphorylation of MET, Akt, and ERK1/2. Importantly,
even in the presence of gefitinib, HGF restored phosphorylation of
Akt and ERK1/2, but not EGFR or ErbB3 (Fig. 2A).

To investigate the mechanism by which PI3K/Akt phosphorylation is restored by HGF, we immunoprecipitated the p85
regulatory subunit of PI3K and examined the association with
MET. In PC-9 and HCC827 cells, ErbB3 was associated with p85,
and this association was inhibited by gefitinib. HGF did not affect
the association of ErbB3 with p85 irrespective of the presence of
gefitinib. MET was constitutively associated with p85, and this
association was unaffected by gefitinib and/or HGF. MET was not
associated with ErbB3, and neither gefitinib nor HGF induced the
association of these two molecules. On the other hand, MET was
constitutively associated with EGFR, and this association was
disrupted by gefitinib, suggesting that the association between
EGFR and MET may be regulated by EGFR phosphorylation status.
However, HGF failed to restore the association inhibited by gefitinib (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that HGF-induced resistance is
mediated by the MET/PI3K signaling axis but not by the ErbB3/
PI3K axis.
Specific down-regulation of MET, but not ErbB3, reversed
gefitinib resistance and phosphorylation of Akt induced by
HGF. We used RNAi technique to confirm this possibility. Downregulation of ErbB3 expression by an ErbB3-specific siRNA did not
affect either HGF-induced resistance to gefitinib or phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 restored by HGF in PC-9 or HCC827 cells.
In contrast, down-regulation of MET expression by MET-specific
siRNA canceled HGF-induced resistance to gefitinib, as well as
phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 restored by HGF (Fig. 3;
Supplementary Fig. S5). These results indicate that HGF induces
gefitinib resistance by restoring the Akt signaling pathway via MET
phosphorylation independently of ErbB3.
High immunoreactivity for HGF in cancer cells of intrinsic
resistant tumors and those with acquired resistance without
T790M second mutation or MET amplification. To assess the
clinical relevance of this resistance mechanism, we examined
whether HGF as well as MET could be detected in tumors with
EGFR-activating mutations obtained from lung adenocarcinoma
patients who showed intrinsic resistance (3 cases) or acquired
resistance (5 cases) to gefitinib, and a comparison was also made

HGF Induces Gefitinib Resistance

with tumors from responders to gefitinib treatment (8 cases).
We analyzed 20 tumors from 16 patients (Table 1). For 3 of 5
patients who developed acquired resistance (i.e., who showed
partial response to gefitinib treatment but showed signs of tumor
regrowth while still receiving gefitinib), we were able to obtain
pairs of tumor specimens before treatment and after the development of acquired resistance to gefitinib. Of 6 acquired resistance
tumors from 5 patients, 4 tumors had T790M second mutation. No
MET amplification was detected in any of these tumors. HGF and
MET immunoreactivity were detected predominantly in cancer
cells, as reported by other groups (27). Immunoreactivity for MET
protein was detected diffusely in all of 20 tumors (Table 1). Importantly, high levels of immunoreactivity for HGF were detected in
cancer cells of 3 of 3 intrinsic resistant tumors and in 1 (patient 7)
of 2 tumors with acquired resistance without T790M second
mutation or MET amplification, whereas only a low level of HGF
immunoreactivity was detected in cancer cells of responders’
tumors (except patient 16) or tumors with acquired resistance with
T790M second mutation (Fig. 4; Table 1). These results strongly
suggest that HGF produced by cancer cells is involved in resistance
to gefitinib in lung adenocarcinomas harboring EGFR-activating
mutations.
HGF derived from tumor cells induces gefitinib resistance of
lung adenocarcinoma cells with EGFR-activating mutation. To
further confirm this, we sought to transfect HGF gene into lung
adenocarcinoma cells. PC-9 and HCC827 cells, which are sensitive
to gefitinib, secreted undetectable levels of HGF (Fig. 5A). PC-9
cells transfected with human HGF gene (PC-9/HGF), but not vector
alone (PC-9/mock), secreted a high level of HGF, and such cells
became highly resistant to gefitinib (Fig. 5A and B), but the
resistance was abrogated by treatment with anti-HGF neutralizing
antibody (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that tumor cell–derived
HGF could induce gefitinib resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells
with EGFR-activating mutations.

Discussion
Both intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors are a serious problem in the treatment of lung cancer
harboring EGFR-activating mutations. In the present study, we
found that HGF induces gefitinib resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cells with EGFR-activating mutations. Despite the limited
number of clinical specimens examined, high levels of HGF immunoreactivity were detected in tumors from patients who showed
intrinsic resistance (3 of 3 cases) or acquired resistance to gefitinib
with no relation to T790M second mutation or MET amplification
(1 of 2 cases). These findings indicate that HGF-mediated MET
activation is one of the novel mechanisms contributing to intrinsic
or acquired gefitinib resistance of lung adenocarcinomas harboring
EGFR-activating mutations.
Engelman and colleagues reported that EGFR is linked to PI3K/Akt
signaling via ErbB3 in NSCLC cell lines that are sensitive to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (31) and that MET amplification leads to
gefitinib resistance by binding and activation of ErbB3 (12). In the
present study, inhibition of ErbB3 with ErbB3 siRNA tended to reduce
the phospho-Akt level and proliferation of both PC-9 and HCC827
cells (Fig. 3C), confirming the importance of ErbB3 in lung adenocarcinoma cells with EGFR-activating mutations. However, HGF
treatment completely restored PI3K/Akt signaling independently of
ErbB3. The results of the present study clearly indicated that HGF
induced gefitinib resistance without the involvement of ErbB3.

Cancer Research

MET can be activated by various mechanisms, including binding
by its ligand, HGF (18), amplification of MET gene itself (12), and
transactivation by other factors such as EGFR (21). We observed
that although human lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 and HCC827 cells
did not show MET amplification or produce detectable levels of
HGF, MET was phosphorylated at an appreciable level, suggesting
transactivation of MET in these cells. Because PC-9 and HCC827
are highly sensitive to gefitinib, MET phosphorylation induced by
transactivation may be insufficient to protect cells from apoptosis
by gefitinib, and thus HGF-induced activation may be necessary in
the presence of gefitinib for survival of lung adenocarcinoma cells
harboring EGFR-activating mutations.
HGF is known to be produced by various stromal component
cells as well as tumor cells. Histologic analyses of clinical
specimens indicated that HGF is expressed by a significant
population of cancer cells, including NSCLC, although HGF is not
expressed in a large population of cancer cell lines of many
different types in vitro (18). In accordance with these reports, we
found that whereas the human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines PC9 and HCC827 did not secrete detectable levels of HGF in vitro, a
high level of HGF was detected predominantly in cancer cells in
clinical specimens (32). Therefore, it will be important to clarify the
regulatory mechanism of HGF expression in lung cancer cells.
Recently, Chen and colleagues (33) reported that cigarette smoking
induced overexpression of HGF in lung cancer cells. Nicotine was
shown to stimulate HGF production in several NSCLC cell lines. In
addition, overexpression of HGF in the tumors was correlated with
history of cigarette smoking in lung cancer patients. It is well
known that nonsmokers with lung cancer show a more favorable
response to gefitinib than smokers (34). Therefore, HGF induced by
cigarette smoking may be involved in gefitinib resistance, at least in
a specific population of lung cancer patients.
Gene alternation of the target itself or its associated molecules,
including secondary mutations (EGFR, KIT, PDGFR , or BCR/ABL)
and gene amplification (MET, KIT, or BCR/ABL), were identified as
mechanisms of acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors in lung
cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia, and gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (10–13, 35–38). Our findings provide the new concept that
receptor (MET) activation by natural ligand (HGF) without gene
mutation or amplification could mediate survival signaling
independently of the target or associated molecules (EGFR and
ErbB3) against tyrosine kinase inhibitor (gefitinib). Moreover, HGFMET signaling is a common pathway that has been reported in a
number of cancers, including lung, breast, colorectal, prostate,
pancreatic, head and neck, gastric, hepatocellular, ovarian, renal,
glioma, melanoma, and a number of sarcomas. Therefore, it will be
valuable to investigate the involvement of HGF-MET–mediated
signaling in acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors in other types
of tumors.

The mechanisms responsible for intrinsic resistance to gefitinib
in lung cancer harboring EGFR-activating mutations are poorly
understood, although several mechanisms of acquired resistance
have been reported (8). To our knowledge, this is the first study to
clarify the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to gefitinib in lung
cancer harboring EGFR-activating mutations. Interestingly, all of
three intrinsically resistant lung cancers examined showed high
levels of HGF immunoreactivity, indicating that HGF plays an
important role in intrinsic resistance to gefitinib. In clinical trials,
25% to 30% of lung cancer patients with EGFR -activating
mutations show intrinsic resistance. Thus, our findings suggest
the usefulness of combined therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor and HGF-MET antagonists in these patients. Moreover,
because HGF also contributes to acquired resistance to gefitinib,
combined therapy may also be applicable for lung cancer showing
acquired resistance without T790M second mutation or MET
amplification.
There are several possible strategies to inhibit HGF-MET
signaling, including anti-HGF neutralizing antibody, HGF antagonist (NK4), and MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (SU11274, PHA665752; refs. 18, 39). We found that anti-HGF antibody as well as
NK4 (data not shown) efficiently abrogated gefitinib resistance
induced by HGF under our in vitro experimental conditions. With
regard to EGF-EGFR targeting, both receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies have been developed for
clinical use. On the other hand, in the case of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF)-VEGF receptor targeting, treatment with
monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab) has been more successful
than with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, further studies
are required to determine which strategy is the most successful for
HGF-MET targeting and in vivo experiments are currently ongoing
in our laboratory.
In conclusion, we show that HGF-mediated MET activation is a
novel mechanism of gefitinib resistance in lung adenocarcinoma
with EGFR-activating mutations. Therefore, inhibition of HGF-MET
signaling may be a considerable strategy for more successful
treatment with gefitinib.
