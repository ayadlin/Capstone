ABSTRACT
AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) activity retards growth of many types
of cancers. Investigating effects of AMPK activation on breast cancer cell signaling
and survival, we found that breast cancer cell lines with amplification and overexpression of HER2 or EGFR are 2- to 5-fold more sensitive to cytotoxic effects of
AICAR, a canonical pharmacological activator of AMPK, than breast cancer cell lines
lacking HER2 or EGFR overexpression. Paralleling effects on cell survival, AICAR
leads to dose- and time-dependent inhibition of HER2 and EGFR in HER2-amplified
breast cancer cells, with activation of AMPK and suppression of HER2/ EGFR activity
preceding commitment to cell death. Transfection of constitutively active AMPKα
also leads to decreased HER2 and EGFR phosphorylation, reduced downstream
signaling associated with these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and reduced breast
cancer cell growth, confirming effects of AMPK activity on HER2/ EGFR. Ensuing coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an interaction of HER2 with AMPK
and an in vitro phosphorylation assay found that HER2 and EGFR contain sequences
that are potential substrates for AMPK. Our results lead us to postulate that AMPK
regulates HER2 and EGFR activity in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells and thus
activation of AMPK might provide therapeutic benefit in such cancers.

INTRODUCTION

factor signaling from oncogene activation as well as
exogenous growth factors [14-16]. Accordingly, AMPK
activity is reduced in many cancers, including breast
cancers where AMPK activation was found to be downregulated in 90% of tumors, and in approximately 20% of
non-small cell lung cancers where the AMPK-upstream
activating kinase LKB1 is genetically inactivated [14,
17]. While AMPK has been proposed as a therapeutic
target in breast cancer and is recognized to inhibit many
of the pathways regulated by tyrosine kinase growth factor
receptors [18], evidence to date has not shown a direct
mechanism for this inhibition. In this article, we describe
evidence that AMPK directly phosphorylates and inhibits
activity of the HER2 and EGFR tyrosine protein kinases.
These important cell signaling interactions between
AMPK and HER2/EGFR have implications with respect
to prevention and treatment of cancer.

As the critical sensor of cellular energy, AMPactivated Protein Kinase (AMPK) is considered to be
the master metabolic regulator of the eukaryotic cell [1].
AMPK is activated in situations that increase the cellular
AMP:ATP ratio, such as exercise, ischemia, glucose
deprivation, and genotoxic and oxidative stresses [2-4].
As a serine-threonine kinase, AMPK regulates a variety
of cellular metabolic pathways with direct downstream
targets that include glycogen synthase [5], HMG-CoA
reductase [6], acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) [7-9],
TSC2 [10, 11], and Raptor [12]. Through these effectors,
AMPK maintains energy homeostasis by turning on
catabolic pathways that generate ATP while switching off
anabolic pathways that consume ATP [13].
Generally, AMPK activity appears to suppress the
development and growth of cancers, overcoming growth

proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells, we first
screened a series of breast cancer cell lines for sensitivity
to AICAR, the canonical activator of AMPK. As shown in
Figure 1A and 1B, we observed considerable variability
in the sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to AICAR
treatment, with breast cancer cell lines known to have high
expression of HER2 (associated with gene amplification)
or EGFR consistently showing greater sensitivity than

cell lines without activation of either of these related
receptor kinase subunits. Relationships between AICAR
sensitivity and HER2 or EGFR activation were observed
in both MTT and clonogenic assays (Figure 1A and 1B),
with representative expression of HER2 and EGFR shown
in Figure 1C.
We then evaluated effects of AICAR on cell cycle
and cell survival by flow cytometry, comparing responses
of HER2-amplified SKBR3 cells to those of HER2/EGFRlow MCF7 cells. Up to 49% of SKBR3 cells showed

sub-G1 nuclear fragmentation after 24 hour treatment with
1mM AICAR with corresponding increases in levels of
cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) (Figure 1D
and 1E), indicative of apoptosis in these cells. By contrast,
we found minimal sub-G1 nuclear fragmentation and no
changes in levels of cleaved PARP in similarly treated
MCF7 cells.
Recognizing that complex genetic differences
among these cancer-derived cell lines are not limited
to the HER2 and EGFR pathways, we then sought to

evaluate how sensitivity to activation of AMPK correlates
with EGFR activity in a syngeneic model using MCF10A
cells, a non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line,
and derivatives of this cell line that were engineered by
retroviral transduction to stably overexpress EGFR [19].
Whereas parental MCF10A cells require high levels of
EGF for proliferation, EGFR-overexpressing derivatives
of MCF10A are capable of proliferating in media with
low EGF [19]. As seen in Figure 1 (panel F), these two
EGFR-overexpressing MCF10A clones showed reduced
ability to proliferate in low-EGF media when treated with
AICAR treatment. By contrast, AICAR treatment did
not affect proliferation of the parental MCF10A cell line,
suggesting that AMPK activation specifically targets the
EGFR pathway in these cells.
We then tested whether activation of EGFR signaling
by exogenous ligand can protect HER2-amplified breast
cancer cells from AICAR-induced toxicity. As shown in
Figure 1G, co-treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer

cells with both EGF and AICAR resulted in significantly
increased survival compared to AICAR treatment alone.
Thus, the effects of AICAR-mediated inhibition of HER2/
EGFR on cell viability can be countered by stimulating
HER2/EGFR signaling through EGF ligand, consistent
with the cytotoxic effects of AMPK activation being
mediated mainly through inhibition of HER2/EGFR
signaling.

AMPK decreases activation of HER2 and EGFR
Given the correlation between high HER2 or
EGFR expression in breast cancer cells and sensitivity
to AMPK activation, we next sought to determine how
AMPK activation might affect kinase activity of EGFR
and HER2. We first confirmed that AICAR’s anti- growth
effect was connected to reduced HER2 and EGFR
signaling by correlating AMPK activation, as assessed by

Figure 3: Effects of activated AMPK on phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR is confirmed by genetic regulation
of AMPK levels and activity. A., B. SKBR3 and HCC1419 cells transfected with constitutively active (CA1–CA4) AMPKα show
decreased phosphorylation of HER2 (Y1248 and Y1196) and EGFR (Y1173), whereas cells transfected with dominant negative (DN)
AMPKα show increased phosphorylation of HER2 (Y1248 and Y1196) and EGFR (Y1173). pAMPK was measured to monitor efficacy of
CA and DN transfections. C. SKBR3 cells were transfected with AMPKα1/2, AMPKβ1, AMPKβ2, or scrambled control siRNA and three
days after transfection, cell lysates were evaluated by immunoblot for HER2, pHER2(Y1248)/pEGFR(Y1173), EGFR, pAMPKα(172),
AMPKα, AMPKβ1/2, and pHER2(Y1221-Y1222). Note increased levels of pHER2 (Y1248)/pEGFR (Y1173) and pHER2 (Y1221-Y1222)
with AMPKβ1 or AMPKβ2 knockdown, while levels of AMPKα and AMPKβ are decreased by corresponding RNAi. D. HCC 1806 cells
were transfected with AMPKβ1, AMPKβ2, or scrambled control siRNA, and three days after transfection, cell lysates were evaluated by
immunoblot for p-EGFR (Y1142) and p-EGFR (Y1068). Note increased levels of EGFR protein phosphorylation at these sites with AMPK
knockdown.

phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase,
with autophosphorylation on sites of HER2 and EGFR that
are linked to kinase activation [20]. As shown in Figure
2, AICAR activates AMPK at doses of less than 1 mM
(Figure 3A and 3B), and this AMPK activation results in
markedly diminished phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR
at activating sites (Figure 2C-2E). Extended treatment
with AICAR also results in decreased levels of total HER2

and EGFR proteins in SKBR3 cells (Figure 2C).
Although AICAR is thought to be relatively
specific for activation of AMPK, we sought to confirm
that inhibitory effects of AICAR on HER2 and EGFR
phosphorylation are mediated by AMPK by transfecting
HCC1419 and SKBR3 cells with AMPKα constitutively
active (CA) and dominant negative (DN) myc-tag
labeled constructs [21]. Clones of cells with myc-

treated with 500µM AICAR for 4 or 8 hours and HCC1806 treated with 1 mM AICAR for 24 hours were immunoprecipitated with antiHER2 (SKBR3) or anti-EGFR (HCC1806) and probed with an antibody specific for phosphorylation of the AMPK consensus sequence
(pACS: LXRXX(p-S/T)). AMPK co-precipitates with HER2 A., and levels of phosphorylated HER2 (Y1248) decrease as seen in other
experiments. Conversely, phosphorylation of the AMPK consensus sequence (pACS) on HER2 and EGFR proteins increases after AICAR
treatment. For both experiments, protein extracts immunoprecipitated with α-rabbit polyclonal antibody alone was used as control. C.

were synthesized and used in in vitro kinase assays. D. In vitro AMPK kinase assay using HER2 peptides (performed in triplicate) show
AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of specific HER2 sequence (designated HER2b). Compound C was used as inhibitor of AMPK kinase
activity, and a variant form (HER2bT→A) of the peptide was used to demonstrate specificity of the phosphorylation site. E. In vitro AMPK
kinase assay using EGFR peptides (performed in triplicate) similarly shows AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of specific EGFR sequence
(designated EGFRb). As above, compound C inhibits AMPK kinase activity, and lack of phosphorylation of a variant form (EGFRbT→A) of
the peptide demonstrates specificity of the phosphorylation site.

tagged expression vectors were isolated under G418
antibiotic selection and analyzed for HER2 and EGFR
phosphorylation status (Figure 3A). Similar to what we
observed after AICAR treatment, AMPK-CA clones of
SKBR3 and HCC1419 cells demonstrated decreased
phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR at sites associated
with kinase activity (Figure 3A). Contrastingly, AMPK
DN clones retained low phosphorylation levels of HER2
and EGFR. As an additional assessment of the link
between AMPK activation and HER2/EGFR inhibition, we
transfected cells with siRNA specific to α- and β-subunits
of AMPK. (Functional AMPK is composed of α, β, and γ
subunits.) We observed AMPK β siRNA to be particularly
efficacious for knockdown of AMPK protein in SKBR3
and HCC1806 cells (Figure 3C and 3D), and we observed
increased activating phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2
after siRNA-mediated AMPK knockdown (Figure 3).
Thus, genetic modulation of AMPK levels affects the
activation status of HER2 and EGFR, supporting our
conclusions that increased AMPK activity inhibits HER2
and EGFR activity.

HER2a, HER2b, EGFRa, and EGFRb (Figure 4D). We
found that sequences designated HER2b and EGFRb
are readily phosphorylated by AMPK in vitro (Figure
4E and 4F). To confirm these sequences as the sites of
AMPK phosphorylation, we synthesized peptides with
modifications of the HER2b and EGFRb sequences, where
the prospective phosphorylated threonines were changed
to alanine: HER2bT→A and EGFRbT→A. The inability of
AMPK to phosphorylate these modified peptides (Figure
4E and 4F) confirmed that HER2 threonine 900 and
EGFR threonine 892 are specific sites for phosphorylation
by AMPK. Thus, our experiments collectively suggest
that AMPK inhibits HER2 and EGFR activity through
direct phosphorylation of specific regulatory sequences
that are distinct from those sequences associated with
kinase activation. Our discovery of AMPK-mediated
regulation of HER2 and EGFR signaling provides a novel
mechanism to explain heightened sensitivity of HER2
and EGFR overexpressing breast cancer cell lines to the
AMPK activating agent, AICAR.

Inhibition of SKBR3 xenograft growth by AICAR
is associated with reduced activity of HER2

AMPK directly phosphorylates HER2 and EGFR
at specific sequences

To determine whether AMPK-mediated regulation
of HER2 and EGFR is relevant to in vivo situations, we
then investigated whether AICAR treatment of mice
bearing SKBR3 xenografts could inhibit the growth of
tumors, and whether growth inhibition would be associated
with inactivation of HER2. For these experiments, NOD
SCID/ IL2 receptor-gamma chain knockout mice (NSG)
were inoculated with SKBR3 cells that had previously
been transfected with pBABE-puro-TdTomato and treated
daily with a single intraperitoneal injection of AICAR.
Remarkably, although AICAR has an in vivo half-life of
only a few hours [25], this once-daily treatment resulted
in significantly inhibited growth of SKBR3 xenografts as
determined by measuring fluorescence in tumor-bearing
mice at 2, 13 and 19 days after tumor cell inoculation
and by measuring tumor weights at the conclusion of the
experiments (Figure 5).
Protein extracted from tumors explanted from
animals one or two hours after AICAR treatment
showed increased phosphorylation of AMPK in parallel
with decreased phosphorylation of HER2 at sites
associated with kinase activity (Figure 5). Confirming
an in vivo effect of AICAR treatment on HER2, we
used immunohistochemistry to assess phosphorylation
of HER2 at tyrosine 1221/1222, as previously reported
[26]. As shown in Figure 5 (panel E) levels of pHER
decreased in tumors from animals two hours after
AICAR treatment, compared to control. Thus, even a suboptimal pharmacological activation of AMPK can result
in decreased HER2 activity and inhibition of growth of
HER2-dependent breast cancer cells.

In light of evidence that AMPK regulates HER2
and EGFR activity, we next questioned whether this
regulation might involve direct phosphorylation of
HER2 and EGFR by AMPK. Previously published data
has shown an ability of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase II to regulate activity of both HER2 and
EGFR proteins by phosphorylation [22, 23], and indeed,
analysis of HER2 and EGFR amino acid sequences
revealed that each of these proteins also has two potential
AMPK substrate consensus sequences, previously defined
as LXRXX(S/T), where X represents any amino acid
[12, 24]. Notably, these sites differ from those identified
previously for phosphorylation by the Ca2+/calmodulindependent protein kinase II. After immunoprecipitating
HER2 and EGFR in HCC1419 and HCC1806 cell extracts,
we used an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated
LXRXX(S/T) AMPK consensus sequence (ACS) to
show that AMPK directly binds to HER2 and EGFR and
to measure phosphorylation of these AMPK substrate
motifs in the HER2 and EGFR proteins (Figure 4A-4C).
Phosphorylation of the LXRXX(S/T) motif increased
with treatment of AICAR, indicating that AMPK directly
phosphorylates HER2/EGFR proteins (Figure 4).
To confirm the ability of AMPK to phosphorylate
HER2 and EGFR, and to determine which of the
two possible phosphorylation sequences on each
of these proteins represents the site of AMPK
phosphorylation, we designed an in vitro kinase assay
using synthesized peptides corresponding to the four
potential phosphorylation sites, which we designated

DISCUSSION

clinical benefit for a variety of anti-EGFR therapies [45].
Consequently, the development of alternative anti-EGFR
therapies is of import for the treatment of TNBC.
Although much is known about EGFR and HER2
activation and subsequent signaling pathways, little is
known about the regulation of EGFR and HER2 under
conditions of metabolic stress. Logically, it would be
expected that cells under metabolic or environmental stress
would not benefit from activation of growth signaling
pathways, and thus inhibition of HER2 and EGFR by
AMPK is consistent with the general anti-anabolic effects
of AMPK on cellular physiology. However, while AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) is known for its varied
functions in regulating lipid, carbohydrate and protein
synthesis [46], our data provide a new understanding of
how AMPK also regulates cellular physiology through
growth factor receptor pathways. Furthermore, our results
suggest a potential therapeutic use of AMPK agonists to
target HER2 or EGFR signaling in cancer.

In summary, we show evidence that activated
AMPK negatively regulates HER2 and EGFR signaling by
phosphorylating both of these proteins at novel regulatory
sites, leading to inhibition of growth and survival of
breast cancer cells that are dependent on these pathways.
Our results thus suggest that AMPK activating agents
have potential therapeutic benefit for HER2- and EGFRdependent breast cancers.
Remarkably, HER2 and EGFR were not identified
as substrates of AMPK by a chemical genetic screen that
did identify twenty eight other previously unrecognized
phosphorylation substrates of AMPK [27]. The inability
of this screen to identify HER2 and EGFR as substrates
of AMPK in this screen was likely because cell lines used
in the experiments did not have high expression of these
protein kinases. Both HER2 and EGFR have importance
in cancer biology, however. For example, HER2 is
amplified and overexpressed in approximately 15% of
breast cancers, as well as some gastric, colon, endometrial,
lung, cervix, esophageal and pancreatic cancers [28], and
EGFR is activated by mutation in some lung cancers and
also overexpressed in many lung, colon, breast, bladder,
kidney, lung, and prostate cancers [29-31]. Thus, EGFR
and HER2, both members of the ErBb family of receptor
tyrosine kinases, are among the most significant protein
kinases implicated in driving human carcinogenesis.
Key players in cancer development and growth,
HER2 and EGFR have emerged as attractive targets for
pharmacological intervention [30, 32]. For example,
trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to HER2
that effectively down-regulates surface HER2, is widely
used in the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer [31, 33-35]. Lapatinib, a small molecule dual
inhibitor of EGFR and HER2, is another therapeutic option
for HER2-positive breast cancer patients [36-38], although
it offers only a 4.3% response rate in patients with HER2positive breast cancer when used as monotherapy [39-41].
While these agents have shown efficacy in the treatment
of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer, not all HER2positive cancers respond even initially to these drugs, and
the development of trastuzumab and lapatinib resistance
is an additional clinical problem [42]. This problem
is exemplified by the number of new approved HER2
directed therapies such as pertuzumab and TDM1, which
can augment trastuzumab’s effectiveness and/or overcome
trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer.
Many breast cancers, particularly those that do
not express estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or
high levels of HER2 (i.e., triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC)) have high levels of expression of EGFR [43].
TNBC is often aggressive, and systemic treatment options
are limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy [44]. Although
anti-EGFR therapy might be expected to be efficacious
for TNBC treatment, clinical trials have thus far shown no

PerkinElmer. ATP and AMP were purchased from
Sigma. In vitro AMPK inhibition was obtained with
the addition of Compound C to the assay. Peptides
were synthesized by the Johns Hopkins Synthesis and
Sequencing Facility as follows: HA Peptide (NH2YPYDVPDYA-OH), HER2#1 (NH2-TLERPKTLSPGRROH), HER2#2 (NH2-SILRRRFTHQSDVRR-OH),
HER2#2A
(NH2-SILRRRFAHQSDVRR-OH),
EGFR#1 (NH2-FLQRYSSDPTGRR-OH), EGFR#2
(NH2-SILHRIYTHQSDVRR-OH), EGFR#2A (NH2SILHRIYAHQSDVRR-OH). Samples were blotted on
P81 Whatman Cellulose Paper (Sigma). Incorporation of
radioisotope was measured by scintillation counting.

Breast cancer xenografts

For xenograft experiments, SKBR3 cells at
~50% confluence were transfected with pBABE-puroTdTomato and selected with puromycin using previously
described methods [47]. NOD-SCID mice (SKCCC
Animal Resources Core Facility) were then inoculated
subcutaneously with 5x106 cells using a Matrigel Matrix
(BD Biosciences, Bedford MA). Beginning one day after
inoculation, mice was randomly divided into groups for
daily intraperitoneal injections of PBS (control) or AICAR
(500 mg/kg). Fluorescence in tumor-bearing mice was
measured at 2, 13 and 19 days after tumor cell inoculation
using the Xenogen IVIS optical imaging system with an
excitation filter 535nm and an emission filter 600nm, and
tdTomato intensity was quantified as total photon counts
using Living Image 2.50 software (Xenogen). Mice were
euthanized 19 days after inoculation, and tumors were
excised, weighed and prepared for protein assays or
immunohistochemistry.
