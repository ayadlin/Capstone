Stabilization to Upregulate Argininosuccinate Synthetase,
Leading to Arginine Deiminase Resistance in Melanoma Cells

Abstract
Melanomas and other cancers that do not express argininosuccinate synthetase (AS), the rate-limiting enzyme
for arginine biosynthesis, are sensitive to arginine depletion with pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20).
However, ADI resistance eventually develops in tumors because of AS upregulation. Although it has been shown
that AS upregulation involves c-Myc, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show that ADIPEG20 activates Ras signaling and the effector extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/GSK-3b kinase cascades, resulting in phosphorylation and stabilization of c-Myc by
attenuation of its ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation mechanism. Inhibition of the induced cell signaling
pathways using PI3K/AKT inhibitors suppressed c-Myc induction and enhanced ADI-mediated cell killing.
Notably, in an animal model of AS-negative melanoma, combination therapy using a PI3K inhibitor plus ADIPEG20 yielded additive antitumor effects as compared with either agent alone. Taken together, our ﬁndings offer
mechanistic insight into arginine deprivation metabolism and ADI resistance, and they illustrate how combining
inhibitors of the Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways may improve ADI-PEG20 anticancer responses.

Introduction
Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin
cancer that accounts for most deaths from skin cancer, and the
cure rates remains less than 10% (1, 2). Effective treatment
modalities for malignant melanoma are urgently needed. It has
been shown that most of malignant melanomas have abnormal
urea cycle metabolism that are unable to carry out de novo
synthesis of arginine (Arg) from citrulline in 2-step reactions
catalyzed by argininosuccinate synthetase (AS) and argininosuccinate lyase (3). AS is the rate-limiting enzyme and malignant melanomas do not express AS and therefore require Arg
from extracellular source for tumor growth. This Arg-auxotrophicity provides a novel approach for using Arg-degrading
enzymes to deplete Arg in the circulation to treat melanoma
and other human malignancies (4). Pegylated recombinant
bacterial arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20), which converts Arg
to citrulline and ammonia resulting in Arg deprivation, has
been under various stages of clinical evaluation for the treat-

ment of malignant melanoma (5). This strategy has also been
used in the treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma (5–8).
Although ADI-PEG20 treatments have shown promising
outcomes in most studies, one important mechanism associated with treatment failure is the development of drug resistance due to reexpression of AS in the tumors. Using cultured
melanoma cells, we previously showed that ADI-PEG20 treatments induced AS expression in A2058 and SK-MEL-2 cells, but
not in A375 cells (9). Induction of AS expression was associated
with upregulation of c-Myc and downregulation of HIF-1a.
HIF-1a functions as a negative regulator by binding to the Ebox at the AS promoter and suppressing AS expression before
the induction. Upon ADI-PEG20 treatment, binding of HIF-1a
at the E-box is replaced by c-Myc, which functions as a positive
regulator for the upregulation of AS. However, the mechanisms
underlying this c-Myc upregulation are unknown. In this study,
we report that upregulation of c-Myc by ADI-PEG20 is due to
enhanced c-Myc protein stability elicited by activation of the
Ras signaling mediated protein kinase cascades. Our ﬁndings
provide a plausible strategy for improving the treatment
efﬁcacy of ADI-PEG20 by intervention in this signal transduction pathway.

Recombinant plasmid DNA encoding dominant negative
(DN) forms of HA-AKT expression was described previously
(10). DN GSK-3b and DN RasN17 expression plasmids were
obtained from Dr. Geoffrey M. Cooper (11, 12) and HA-USP-28
recombinant DNA was from Dr. Stephen J. Elledge (13).
Cell culture, siRNA transfection, and SRB cytotoxicity
assay
A2058, SK-MEL-2, and A375 melanoma cells and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection Center and were not further tested or
authenticated. All cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS at 5%
CO2 atmosphere. For Arg depletion, cells were either maintained in the regular medium containing 0.3 mg/mL ADIPEG20 or cultured in Arg-free DMEM medium containing
10% dialyzed FBS. All transfections were done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
For the cytotoxicity assay, cells were seeded in 96-well
plates (4  103 cells per well) and cultured with different
concentrations of inhibitors with or without ADI-PEG20 for
72 hours. Cells were ﬁxed with 50% trichloroacetic acid
followed by staining with 0.4% SRB in 1% acetic acid for
30 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed 5 times
with 1% acetic acid to remove unbound dye. Bound dye was
dissolved by adding 10 mmol/L unbuffered Tris base. Cell
proliferation was calculated by measuring OD at 564 nm
using a spectrophotometer.
Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and Northern
blot
Procedures for cell extract preparations and immunoprecipitation were previously described (9). Brieﬂy, protein samples were incubated with an antibody and 50 mL 50% protein A
sepharose beads. Protein A beads were collected and the
immunopricipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by
immunoblotting and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
For Northern blotting, cells were harvested by TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was extracted according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total RNA
samples were separated by 2% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized

www.aacrjournals.org

to [a-32P]dCTP-labeled (PerkinElmer) c-Myc cDNA probe
according to the standard procedures.
Mouse experiments
Female athymic NCR nu/nu-nude mice (aged 7 weeks,
weight 20 grams, from National Cancer Institute-Frederick
Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD)
were housed in a pathogen-free environment. The animals
were inoculated subcutaneously with 2  106 A2058 melanoma
cells in 100 mL physiologic buffered saline (PBS) into the right
ﬂank of mice. Ten days later, when the tumor volumes reached
approximately 20 mm3, the animals were randomly divided
into 4 groups with 6 animals per group and the treatments were
initiated by intraperitoneal injections according to the following protocol. The ﬁrst group received 100 mL PBS, the second
group received Ly294002 (25 mg/kg), the third group received
ADI-PEG20 (4 IU or 0.625 mg/100 mL), and fourth group
received Ly294002 (25 mg/kg) plus ADI-PEG20 (4 IU). Each
group of animals received the same doses of drugs twice per
week thereafter. Tumor size was measured by caliper. Tumor
volume was calculated using the formula: (length  width2)/2.
Statistical analysis was done by Student t test using Microsoft
Excel 2007 program. P < 0.05 was regarded as signiﬁcant. Error
bars represent SEM.
Other procedures
Enzymatic activity assays for phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate (10) and PTEN (14), and DNA fragmentation assay (15)
followed the procedures previously described.

Results
ADI-PEG20 induces c-Myc protein stabilization
The enhancement of c-Myc expression by ADI-PEG20 could
be regulated at the transcriptional level or at the posttranscriptional level. To distinguish between these 2 possibilities,
we carried out Northern blotting and Western blotting analyses to evaluate c-Myc mRNA and protein levels,
respectively. Figure 1A shows that although induction of cMyc protein was detectable within 1 hour of treatment and
continued throughout the 8 hours of treatment, no corresponding increases in c-Myc mRNA levels were seen (Fig.
1B). These results suggested that the induction mechanism is
either by enhanced protein synthesis or by reduced protein
degradation. To differentiate between these possibilities, we
treated A2058 cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX
with or without ADI-PEG20. In the absence of ADI-PEG20, cMyc protein levels were reduced rapidly with a half-life (t½) of
approximately 20 minutes (Fig. 1C, top), consistent with the
previous report that c-Myc is a very unstable protein with t½
between 20 and 30 minutes (16). In the presence of ADI-PEG20,
c-Myc degradation was attenuated, and more than 70% of
c-Myc remained even after 4 hours of treatment (Fig. 1C,
bottom). In this experiment, we purposely overexposed the
blot so that c-Myc expression level at the 0 time point could be
visualized, as in contrast to those shown in Fig. 1A. These
results showed that ADI-PEG20 treatment induces c-Myc
protein stabilization.

Figure 1. Induction of c-Myc by ADI-PEG20 is due to inhibition of c-Myc ubiquitination. A, Western blot shows that c-Myc protein was increased in
response to ADI-PEG20, whereas Northern blot (B) shows that c-MYC mRNA levels were not affected by ADI-PEG20 treatment for up to 8 hours in A2058 cells.
C, effects of CHX on c-Myc expression in A2058 cells treated with ADI-PEG20. Cells were incubated with100 mmol/L CHX in the presence or absence of
ADI-PEG20. Protein extracts were obtained at the indicated time points. Expression levels of c-Myc and actin were analyzed by Western blotting.
D, ADI-PEG20 prevented ubiquitination of c-Myc protein. A2058 cells transfected with HA-Ub–encoding plasmid were treated with 10 mmol/L MG-132 in the
absence or presence of ADI-PEG20 for 4 hours. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti–c-Myc antibody, followed by Western blotting with
anti-HA and anti–c-Myc antibodies as indicated. E, ADI-PEG20 induces association of USP-28, Fbw7a, and c-Myc. A2058 cells were transfected with USP-28
and Fbw7a-expressing plasmids for 16 hours. Cells were treated with 10 mmol/L MG-132 in the absence or presence of ADI-PEG20 for 4 hours. Cells were
lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. F, ADI-PEG20 induces
association of endogenous c-Myc and USP-28 in MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with ADI-PEG20 for 1 and 2 hours. Cells were lysed and
cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti–c-Myc antibody. The precipitates and input lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti–c-Myc
(N-262) and anti–c-Myc (9E10) and anti–USP-28 antibodies as indicated. IB, immunoblot; IP, immunoprecipitation.

Activation of Ras/PI3K/AKT for c-Myc Stability by ADI-PEG20

treating the cells with or without ADI-PEG20. Cell lysates were
prepared and c-Myc was immunoprecipitated with anti–c-Myc
antibody using normal rabbit IgG as a negative control. The
immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using
anti-HA antibody. Figure 1D shows that a signiﬁcant amount of
polyubiquitinated c-Myc was present in the ADI-PEG20–
untreated cells; whereas almost no ubiquitinated c-Myc was
detected in the ADI-PEG20–treated cells. These results showed
that ADI-PEG20–induced c-Myc accumulation was due to
inhibition of c-Myc ubiquitination for protein degradation.
One of the important pathways for ubiquitin-dependent
regulation of c-Myc turnover is controlled by the interactions with both USP-28 and Fbw7. Fbw7a is a subunit of the
E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCFFbw7 that recognizes c-Myc
in response to speciﬁc stimuli leading to ubiquitination and
subsequent proteasome degradation of c-Myc (19). In contrast, USP-28, which forms a complex with Fbw7a and
counteracts the degradation of c-Myc by removing ubiquitins conjugated by Fbw7a (20). To investigate the possible
roles of USP-28/Fbw7a in ADI-PED20–mediated c-Myc stabilization, we transfected A2058 cells with recombinant
plasmids encoding Frag-Fbw7a and HA-USP-28, in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132, followed by treatment
with or without ADI-PEG20. c-Myc was subsequently immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting with anti–
c-Myc, anti–USP-28, and anti-Flag antibodies. Our results
showed that ADI-PEG20 treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant association between overexpresssed USP-28 and the
c-Myc/Fbw7a complex (Fig. 1E). We next investigated the
effects of ADI-PEG20 on the interactions between endogenous USP-28 and c-Myc. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
with ADI-PEG20 for either 1 or 2 hours. Cell lysates were
prepared and c-Myc was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti–c-Myc antibody (N-262). The precipitates were
probed with anti-USP-28 antibody, anti–c-Myc antibody
(N-262), and anti–c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10). Figure
1F shows that ADI-PEG20 treatment enhances the interaction between USP-28 and c-Myc. These results suggested the
involvement of USP-28/Fbw7a in the ADI-PEG20–mediated
c-Myc accumulation.
ADI-PEG20–induced c-Myc stabilization is mediated by
the ERK and PI3K/AKT-GSK3b signaling pathways
c-Myc protein is targeted for ubiquitin proteasomal degradation mechanism by phosphorylation at 2 speciﬁc amino acid
residues at the N-terminus, serine 62 (S62) and threonine 58
(T58). S62 is a target of ERK and T-58 is targeted by GSK-3b (21,
22). ERK-mediated phosphorylation of S62 prevents c-Myc
from degradation, whereas GSK-3b–phosphorylated T-58 promotes c-Myc degradation (21, 22). We investigated the possible
involvement of these pathways and found that ADI-PEG20
treatment activated ERK and enhanced c-Myc phosphorylation at S62 in association with increased c-Myc levels (Fig. 2A).
To test for the causal involvement of the ERK signaling, we used
the chemical inhibitor U0126, which speciﬁcally inactivates
MEK1/2 (ERK kinase). Western blot analysis revealed that
U0126 was effective in completely inhibiting c-Myc phosphorylation and reducing c-Myc expression levels (Fig. 2A). These

www.aacrjournals.org

results suggested that ERK is involved in the posttranslational
modiﬁcation and stabilization of c-Myc in response to ADIPEG20.
Phosphorylation of c-Myc at T58 by GSK-3b, a serine/
threonine kinase, is recognized by Fbw7 in the proteasomal
protein degradation signal (22). It has been shown that GSK-3b
itself is a target of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKTmediated phosphorylation at Ser9 position. GSK-3b phosphorylation inactivates its ability of phosphorylating c-Myc(T58),
resulting in stabilization of c-Myc. PI3K/AKT also phosphorylates GSK-3a(Ser21). We asked whether this pathway regulates c-Myc stability in response to ADI-PEG20 challenge in
A2058 cells. Phosphorylation of GSK-3b(Ser9) and GSK-3a
(Ser21) in the ADI-PEG20–treated cells were determined using
anti–p-GSK-3a and anti–p-GSK-3b antibodies, respectively.
We found that ADI-PEG-20 induces phosphorylation of
GSK-3b, but not GSK-3a (using lysate from 293T cells as a
positive control), in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B).
Because phosphorylated c-Myc(T58) levels were not detectable
even in the unstimulated A2058 cells (using lysate from the
c-Myc–transfected A2058 cells as a positive control), we turned to MDA-MB-231 cells and observed that ADI-PEG20 treatment indeed reduced p-c-Myc(T58) expression in these cells
(Fig. 2B, bottom). These results showed that ADI-PEG20 treatment induces GSK-3b phosphorylation in association with
reduced c-Myc(T58) phosphorylation.
We also showed that knockdown of GSK-3b using siRNA led
to increased c-Myc levels even without ADI-PEG20 treatment,
whereas ADI-PEG20 plus GSK-3b siRNA treatments further
increased c-Myc levels (Fig. 2C). Likewise, expression of GSK3b-DN alone enhanced the expression of c-Myc compared with
empty vector–transfected cells, and together with ADI-PEG20
treatment further enhanced the expression of c-Myc in the
GSK-3b-DN–transfected cells (Fig. 2D). In addition, we used a
potent mammalian GSK-3 inhibitor, LiCl, which competes
against the cofactor Mg2þ for GSK-3 activity (23). We found
that LiCl treatment enhanced the expression of c-Myc and its
downstream target AS in ADI-PEG20–treated MDA-MB-231
cells (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results showed that GSK3b plays an inhibitory role in ADI-PEG20–mediated c-Myc
stabilization.
ADI-PEG20–induced phosphorylation of GSK-3b could be
due to activation of PI3K/AKT signaling. To investigate the role
of PI3K/Akt in ADI-PEG20–induced GSK-3b phosphorylation,
we measured PI3K activity in extracts from ADI-PEG20–treated cells using phosphotidylinositol as a substrate. Figure 3A
shows that induction of PI3K activity occurred as early as 15
minutes and persisted throughout the 4 hours of ADI-PEG20
treatment. Activation of PI3K by ADI-PEG20 was also shown by
the induction of Akt(T308) phosphorylation, a downstream
effector of PI3K (Fig. 3B). We further showed that inhibition of
PI3K activity with LY294002 suppressed the ADI-PEG20–
induced phosphorylation of Akt(T308) and GSK-3b(Ser9) and
expression levels of c-Myc (Fig. 3C). Likewise, a DN mutant
form of AKT suppressed the induction of p-GSK-3b(Ser9) and
the expression of c-Myc and AS in a dose-dependent manner in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3D). Activation of PI3K by ADI-PEG20
is apparently not due to downregulation of PTEN, which is a

phosphatase that negatively regulates PI3K signaling (24,
25), as we failed to detect reduction of PTEN expression
levels by Western blotting within the ﬁrst 4 hours of the
treatment (Fig. 3E). Nor did we see reduction of PTEN
phosphatase activities using sodium selenite treatment,
which is known to induce PTEN activity, as a positive control
(ref. 26; Fig. 3E). Overall, these results indicated that upregulation of c-Myc is through the inhibition of GSK-3b
activity, which is mediated by the activation of PI3K/AKT
in response to ADI-PEG20.

Involvement of Ras signaling in ADI-PEG20–induced
c-Myc stabilization and cell line speciﬁcity
One important upstream activator for PI3K/Akt pathway is
Ras. To investigate whether Ras is involved in ADI-induced
PI3K/AKT activation that leads to c-Myc accumulation, we
measured Ras activity in ADI-treated A2058 cells. Figure 4A
shows that induction of Ras activity by ADI-PEG20 occurred as
early as 5 minutes after A2058 cells were exposed to ADIPEG20. Moreover, a DN mutant form of Ras (RasN17) could
reduce the signal of pT308-AKT and c-Myc protein levels in

response to ADI-PEG20 in A2058 cells (Fig. 4B). These results,
collectively, showed that induction of c-Myc expression by
ADI-PEG20 is due to activation of Ras/PI3K/Akt/ERK pathways in A2058 cells.
Our results described thus far were mainly carried out in the

activation of Ras, phosphorylation of AKT, phosphorylation of
GSK-3b, and activation of ERK signals in A2058, SK-MEL-2, and
MDA-MB231 cells, but not in A375 cells. These effects were
correlated with induced expression of c-Myc and AS proteins in
these cells (Fig. 4C). This correlation suggests an important
role of Ras/PI3K/Akt/GSK-3b/ERK signaling in the upregulation of c-Myc under Arg deprivation conditions in multiple cell
lines.
Inhibitors of PI3K/AKT signaling can enhance ADIPEG20–mediated cell killing through apoptosis
The results above suggested that targeting the Ras/PI3K/
AKT pathway may enhance ADI-PEG200 s cell killing capacity
by preventing AS expression. As a proof-of-principle, we tested
2 PI3K inhibitors, Ly294002 and PI103, both are pan-PI3K
inhibitors for class I (PI3Ka/b/g/d; 27). We also included 2
AKT inhibitors, VIII, which is an AKT1 and AKT2 isozymeselective inhibitor (28) and perifosine, which targets the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt, preventing its translocation to the plasma membrane (28, 29). These inhibitors may
have various off-targets when high concentrations (50 mmol/L)
were used. A2058 cells were maintained in normal medium,
ADI-containing medium, or Arg-deﬁcient medium, each with
or without these inhibitors (10 or 5 mmol/L). As anticipated,
cells cultured in Arg-deﬁcient medium, such as those grown in
the ADI-PEG20–containing medium, upregulated AS and cMyc expression (Fig. 5A). All 4 inhibitors suppressed the
induction of pT308-AKT, c-Myc, and AS expression by either

ADI-PEG20 or Arg-negative culture conditions (Fig. 5A).
Although each of these inhibitors shows dose-dependent anticell proliferative activities, when in combination with ADIPEG20, each of these inhibitors showed additive effects on
cell growth as compared with ADI-PEG20 or individual inhibitors alone (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, although we found that
A2058 cells treated with each of these 4 inhibitors or arginine
deprivation for up to 48 hours only produced minimally
detectable DNA fragmentation, combination treatment with
ADI-PEG20 produced signiﬁcant effects on genomic DNA
fragmentation (Fig. 5C). These results showed that inhibition
of PI3K/AKT pathway enhances the cell killing capacity of ADIPEG20.
PI3K inhibitor can enhance antitumor activity of ADIPEG20 in animal tumor model
To test whether PI3K inhibitor would enhance antitumor
activity of ADI-PEG20 in vivo, we treated A2058 xenografts in
animals with vehicle, ADI-PEG20, Ly294002, or combination of
both drugs. Ten days after treatments, we found that the
average tumor volumes were 672.6  80.9, 174.6  38.4,
114.2  17.3, and 51.6  19.5 mm3, in the PBS-, and ADIPEG20-, Ly294002-, and combination of ADI-PEG20 and ADIPEG20)-treated groups, respectively (Fig. 6A). These corresponded to 74% (P < 0.001), 83% (P < 0.001), and 92% (P <
0.0005) reduction of tumor volumes in the ADI-PEG20-,
Ly294002-, and ADI-PEG20þLy294002-treated groups, respectively, as compared with the PBS-treated group. Representative

Discussion
In this study, we elucidated the underlying mechanism
associated with c-Myc induction by ADI-PEG20. Our results,
as schematically summarized in Fig. 7, show that ADI-PEG20
activates Ras signal and its downstream kinase cascades,
resulting in c-Myc stabilization. C-Myc has been recognized
as one of important mammalian transcription regulator.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have revealed that
about 10% to 20% of total cellular genes are regulated by
c-Myc through E-box interactions (30, 31). These genes are
involved in a vast variety of cellular functions including cell
proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, metabolism, invasion, and metastasis (32, 33). Multiple regulation
mechanisms starting from transcriptional initiation to protein turnover are involved in c-Myc expression in response
to various extracellular challenges (18). The molecular
mechanism underlying how c-Myc stabilization is induced
in response to Arg deprivation as elucidated in this study
exempliﬁes the exquisite regulation mechanism of c-Myc
expression in drug resistance research.
At least 8 protein factors (including Fbw7, USP-28, Fbx29,
Skp2, b-TRCP, Truss, Hect-19, and Trim32) have been reported
to control c-Myc stability through ubiquitination (for review,
see ref. 18). Among these, the Fbw7/USP-28 ubiquitination/
deubiquitination system is the best characterized partners.
Whereas Fbw7 binds to phosphorylated c-Myc, USP-28 does
not bind to c-Myc directly but through interaction with Fbw7
and reverses the ubiquitination built by Fbw7 (20, 34), thereby
protecting c-Myc from degradation. These observations suggest that cellular levels of USP-28 have a profound inﬂuence on
Fbw7-mediated c-Myc stabilization. In this study, we found
that ADI-PEG20 treatment drastically increased the association between USP-28 and c-Myc. These ﬁndings underscore the
important role of USP-28 in ADI-PEG20–induced c-Myc accu-

mulation, although it remains possible that other protein
factors could also be involved.
The importance of Fbw7/USP-28 in the ADI-PEG20–dependent c-Myc regulation is also supported by the elucidation of
their upstream signal transduction pathways. The role of PI3K
in regulation of c-Myc has been supported by several recent
reports showing that inhibition of PI3K activity resulted in
ampliﬁcation or overexpression of c-Myc, and that c-Myc
overexpression could confer resistance to PI3K inhibitors,
although the underlying mechanism was not elucidated in
these reports (35–37).
We could detect activation of Ras signaling in melanoma
cells within 5 minutes after ADI-PEG20 treatment. Such rapid
activation suggests an intricate sensing mechanism for Arg
deﬁciency in melanoma cells. Whether the sensing mechanism
involves activation of membrane-bound receptor(s) that transmit signal to Ras resulting in c-Myc accumulation remains to
be investigated (Fig. 7). The Ras pathway is a key regulator of
cancer cell survival and has been shown to be constitutively
active in many cancer types, including the 4 cell lines used in
this study, either by BRAF(V600E) mutations (A2058 and A375)
or Ras mutations (SK-MEL-2), or both (MDA-MB-231; ref. 38).
Notably, we found correlations between Ras/PI3K/AKT/ERK
activation and c-Myc/AS inducibility by ADI-PEG20 among 4
melanoma cell lines. Although the steady-state level of c-Myc
level in A375 cells is higher than those in other 3 cell lines, the
inability of c-Myc/AS induction in A375 cells is due to defective
Ras upstream signal, and elucidation of this defective mechanism is currently underway in our laboratories. We previously
showed that lack of c-Myc/AS induction by ADI-PEG20 in A375
cells is associated with the inability of developing resistance to
ADI-PEG20 (9). Although the number of cell lines used remains
small and further in-depth studies are needed, our current
results suggest that Ras pathway may offer not only as a
potential target for therapeutic intervention but also as a
useful biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes of ADIPEG20 in clinical setting.
Because of the importance of the Ras/PI3K/AKT/ERK pathway in many aspects of human malignancies, including tumor

growth, proliferation, invasion, and sensitivity to therapy,
clinical studies have been done using inhibitors of this pathway
in human cancers (39–41). Examples of these drugs are listed
in Fig. 7. Of particular relevance to malignant melanoma are
those targeting mutant BRAF(V600E), a recurrent mutation
occurs in 50% to 60% of malignant melanomas. Clinical trials of
inhibitors targeting this mutation have shown remarkable
results (42); however, resistance to BRAF(V600E) almost inevitably developed after prolonged treatment, through activation
of alterative/compensatory survival pathways, such as
PDGFRb or N-Ras (43), mitogen-activated protein kinase
(44), and IGF-1R/PI3K (45), and combined treatment with
inhibitors of IGF-1F/PI3K induces cell death in BRAF-resistant
variants (45). The present demonstration that inhibitors of the
PI3K/AKT pathway can enhance the cell killing capacity by
ADI-PEG20 suggests that intervention of this pathway may
have added advantages for ADI-PEG20 cancer chemotherapy.
We envision that inhibitors of BRAF(V600E), such as the
inhibitors of anti-PI3K and anti-AKT that have been shown
in this study, would also enhance cell killing effects of ADIPEG20. These approaches of simultaneously targeting 2 prevalent genetic abnormalities in melanoma (BRAF mutation and
Arg-auxotrophicity) may improve the treatment efﬁcacy of
malignant melanoma.

ADI resistance

Finally, our present study on ADI-PEG20 in melanoma
cells may provide important information for the use of other
Arg-degrading enzymes in cancer chemotherapy, such as
recombinant arginases that convert Arg into orinithine and
urea. Recombinant arginases have also been in various
stages of clinical development for human cancer chemotherapy (46–49).
