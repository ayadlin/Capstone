ABSTRACT
Sarcomas are malignant tumors accounting for a high percentage of cancer
morbidity and mortality in children and young adults. Surgery and radiation therapy
are the accepted treatments for most sarcomas; however, patients with metastatic
disease are treated with systemic chemotherapy. Many tumors display marginal levels
of chemoresponsiveness and new treatment approaches are needed. Deregulation
of the G1 checkpoint is crucial for various oncogenic transformation processes,
suggesting that many cancer cell types depend on CDK4/6 activity. Thus, CDK4/6
activity appears to represent a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
In the present work, we explore the efficacy of CDK4 inhibition using palbociclib
(PD0332991), a highly selective inhibitor of CDK4/6, in a panel of sarcoma cell lines
and sarcoma tumor xenografts (PDXs). Palbociclib induces senescence in these cell
lines and the responsiveness of these cell lines correlated with their levels of CDK4
mRNA. Palbociclib is also active in vivo against sarcomas displaying high levels of
CDK4 but not against sarcomas displaying low levels of CDK4 and high levels of
p16ink4a. The analysis of tumors growing after palbociclib showed a clear decrease in
the CDK4 levels, indicating that clonal selection occurred in these treated tumors. In
summary, our data support the efficacy of CDK4 inhibitors against sarcomas displaying
increased CDK4 levels, particularly fibrosarcomas and MPNST. Our results also suggest
that high levels of p16ink4a may indicate poor efficacy of CDK4 inhibitors.

than 50 benign tumor subtypes [4]. Sarcomas are usually
grouped in two broad categories according to molecular
genetics: sarcomas harboring a diploid or nearly diploid
karyotype and simple genetic driver alterations, such
as Ewing’s sarcoma, or sarcomas with a complex and
imbalanced karyotype, such as osteosarcoma. Both
subgroups include very different clinical entities and are
broadly drawn, not reflecting the genetic diversity among
tumors of a given type or subtype or their diverse tumor
biology [4].
Surgery is the accepted treatment for most sarcomas.
However, for those patients with unresectable disease or
residual tumors following surgery, radiation therapy is
also used. Patients with metastatic disease are treated with
systemic chemotherapy, usually consisting of doxorubicin
and ifosfamide [6]. This approach has been demonstrated

INTRODUCTION
Sarcomas are malignant tumors derived from the
mesenchymal nonepithelial tissue developed from the
embryonic mesoderm [1], comprising less than 10% of
all cancers [2, 3] but account for a higher percentage of
overall cancer morbidity and mortality in children and
young adults than in adults. The overwhelming majority of
sarcomas are sporadic with unknown etiology, but several
well-described genetically linked cancer predisposition
syndromes and well-documented types of environmental
exposure have been associated with specific types of
sarcoma [2, 3]. Sarcomas arise from multiple lineages
and range from indolent to highly invasive and metastatic
[4, 5]. Taxonomical analysis of sarcomas has identified
approximately 60 subtypes of sarcoma, as well as more

to be effective in patients who have localized tumors, and
the long-term survival rates of such patients are increasing
[6]. However, for many tumors that exhibit marginal levels
of chemoresponsiveness and for metastatic disease, new
treatment approaches are needed. Treatments for sarcomas
include doxorubicin, gemcitabine, ifosfamide and the
recently accepted drug trabectedin [7–10]. Currently, few
specific genetic alterations in sarcomas are direct targets
for therapy, in contrast to the circumstance for epithelial
cancers. The exceptions are GISTs, in which the Kit kinase
inhibitor imatinib induces a partial response or stable
disease in approximately 80% of sarcoma patients [4].
Those findings support the hypothesis that widely diverse
sarcoma tumors may share a dependence on a particular
kinase and that inhibiting this kinase may, therefore, be
expected to be effective for all histological subtypes that
are positive for this biomarker.
Aberrant regulation of the cell cycle is a hallmark
of cancer, and multiple mechanisms contribute to the
deregulation of the G1-to-S checkpoint [11, 12]. These
mechanisms include amplification or mutation of the
CDK4 and CDK6 genes, amplification of the genes
encoding D-type cyclins and deletion or silencing of
the CDKN2A/B gene, which encodes for the INK4
inhibitors p16ink4a and p15ink4b [13–15]. Additionally,
the aberrant expression of growth factors or growth
factor receptors and oncogenes can activate downstream
signaling molecules that drive the expression of cyclin
D1 [14]. Cell cycle deregulation is crucial for various
oncogenic transformation processes, suggesting that
many cancer cells depend on high CDK4/6 activity
[16–21]. In contrast, the normal development of most
tissues can occur in the absence of cyclin D-CDK4/6
complexes [22, 23]. Using strains of genetically
modified mice, genetic studies have provided direct
evidence for the role of CDK4 in tumor development.
Mice lacking cyclin D1 were refractory to mammary
tumor development induced by the ErbB2 oncogene, the
ortholog of HER2, which is frequently overexpressed in
human breast carcinomas [19, 24, 25]. Additionally, mice
expressing a mutant form of cyclin D1 that binds to, but
does not activate, CDK4 are resistant to erbB2-induced
tumorigenesis. The ablation of CDK4 using siRNA in
erbB2-induced mammary tumor cells eliminates their
oncogenic properties [18]. The loss of CDK4 has also
been implicated in the inability of KRasG12-induced
lung tumors and c-Myc-induced skin tumors to develop
[16, 21, 26]. CDK4/6 activity thus appears to represent
a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment
[27–29].
Several highly selective inhibitors of CDK4 and
CDK6 are currently being tested in phase II/III clinical
trials against a variety of pRb-proficient chemotherapyresistant cancers (http://ClinicalTrials.gov) [30, 31]. The
broad-spectrum CKI flavopiridol displayed promising
preclinical results in multiple tumor cell types [32–35],
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

but it exhibited adverse effects and high toxicity in
early-phase clinical trials [36]; furthermore, it did
not meet expectations with regard to efficacy against
most tumor types, with the exception of leukemia [34,
37, 38]. Palbociclib (PD0332991) is the first highly
selective inhibitor of CDK4/6 to be tested and approved
in humans for use in combination with letrozole for
the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer
as an initial endocrine-based therapy for metastatic
disease. Palbociclib exhibits an in vitro half-maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10–15 nM for
CDK4/6, compared to 0.5 μM for CDK2 [39–41]. In fact,
palbociclib has been tested in rabdomyosarcoma [42]
and liposarcoma harboring elevated CDK4 expression
[43, 44]. Recently, palbociclib has entered a phase II
trial in patients with advanced CDK4-amplified or well
differentiated liposarcoma [44]. Preclinical studies have
demonstrated that palbociclib induces G1 arrest in pRbpositive cell lines and suppresses the growth of various
xenografted tumors [31, 39–41, 45]. In different cancer
models, treatment with PD0332991 not only exerts a
cytostatic effect but also induces either the senescence
or the apoptotic cell death of tumoral cells [46]. The only
known mechanism of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition
is the loss of pRb function [16, 31, 45, 47]. However,
other mechanisms such as p16ink4a loss, cyclin D1
overexpression of elevated CDK2 expression have been
proposed [31, 48, 49].
In the present work, we tested the suitability of
CDK4 inhibition using palbociclib for sarcomas and
explored possible markers of efficacy that are independent
of the sarcoma tumor type. We found that tumor cells and
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) respond more strongly
to a CDK inhibitor when they express high levels of
CDK4 but exhibit resistance to the CDK inhibitor when
they express high levels of p16ink4a.

RESULTS
Palbociclib induces senescence in sarcoma cell
lines from different origins
To explore the effect of CDK4 inhibition, we used
a panel of 10 low-passaged sarcoma cell lines generated
directly from patient samples and 2 commercial cell
lines of heterogeneous origin and different molecular
karyotypes (Table 1) [53, 54, 57]. We treated these
12 sarcoma cell lines with different concentrations of
palbociclib and obtained an IC50 of for each cell line.
All responses were in the low μM range (Table 1). These
values are higher than the reported in breast tumor cell
lines [40, 58, 59].
To explore in detail the effect of this CDK
inhibitor, we selected four different cell lines and

measured the effect produced by palbociclib. We
found that in all cell lines tested, palbociclib induced
growth arrest at Go/G1 based on the detection of
markers of cellular senescence (Figure 1). After 4
days of treatment, palbociclib induced the formation
of nuclear foci containing the 53BP1 protein (Figure
1A), concomitant with strong SA ß-Gal staining (Figure
1B) and reduced pRb phosphorylation (Figure 1C),
as expected from the CDK4/6 inhibitory activity of
palbociclib. However, we did not detect a significant
change in the p16ink4a levels. Moreover, in the BG
cell line, the only cell line harboring wild type p53,
treatment with palbociclib did not significantly alter
p21waf1 protein expression (Figure 1C).

cells. Initially, we did not find any correlation of the
palbociclib response with tumor type or the complexity
of the karyotype (Figure 2A). It has been reported that
in different cell models, the activity of palbociclib may
be related to the p16ink4a, cyclin D1 or CDK4 levels. The
levels of these factors were characterized in our cell lines
(table 2, Supplementary figure S1), and we analyzed their
correlation with the efficacy of palbociclib. We found
that in vitro, the sensitivity of palbociclib is related to
high CDK4 levels, either at the mRNA (Student’s T test,
p = 0.017) or the protein level (Student’s T test, p = 0.077)
(Figure 2A), but not to the levels of p16ink4a, cyclin D1 or
p53 (Figure 2A).
To further explore the functional relevance of CDK4
levels to the efficacy of CDK inhibitors, we treated a
panel of cell lines with flavopiridol and performed similar
analyses (Supplementary Table S1). We found a similar
correlation between the sensitivity of the cells to the CDK
inhibitor and their levels of CDK4 (Supplementary Figure
S3). As in palbociclib, we did not find any correlation
between sensitivity to flavopiridol in vitro and the levels of
p16ink4a or cyclin D1 or the sarcoma type (Data not shown).

Role of the CDK4 levels in the response
of sarcoma cell lines to palbociclib
Although we examined a limited number of cell
lines, which may limit the relevance of the findings, we
next set up to explore whether the activity of palbociclib
correlates with any molecular characteristics of the

To study the functional relationship between the
CDK4 levels and the cellular response to palbociclib,
we overexpressed wild type CDK4 cDNA in 2 different
sarcoma cell lines, AW and AX (Figure 2B). Because
it has been reported that CDK4R24C, an active mutant of
CDK4, is present in human tumors (athough not reported
in sarcomas) and cannot be inhibited by members of the
INK4 family, we decided to overexpress this mutant in
these sarcoma cells (Figure 2B) in order to gain insight
on palbociclib mechanism by exploring the effect of
CDK4R24C on its cellular response. An increased sensitivity
to palbociclib was observed in cells overexpressing wild
type CDK4, whereas the overexpression of the CDK4R24C
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mutant increased the resistance of both sarcoma cell lines
to palbociclib (Figure 2C).
Next, we analyzed the effect of palbociclib on
these engineered cell lines. We found that palbociclib
induced cellular senescence in parental cells and
in cells overexpressing wild type CDK4 (Figure
3A and 3B). The levels of senescence markers
positively correlated with a reduction in the levels
of phosphorylated pRb and an increase in the p16 ink4a
and p21 cip1 levels (Figure 3C). Alternatively, the
induction of senescence markers was not observed
in cells overexpressing the CDK4 R24C mutant; these
cells preferentially entered apoptosis after palbociclib

such as S29, did not show any effect of to palbociclib
administration on KI67 expression (Figure 5A).
To explore the effect of palbociclib in these tumors
we analyzed the response of cell cycle related proteins to
palbociclib (Figure 5B). Thus, we collected the tumors the
day after treatment from the same tumors and analyzed by
western blot the the cell cycle relates proteins in tumors
untreated and treated with palbociclib (Figure 5B). We
can appreciate that palbociclib induces a decrease in all
cell cycle related proteins, with a clear effect on pRb
phosporylation in all models, either responding or not
responding, as well as CDK4, confirming the activity of
palbociclib in all models.
However, we observed different tumor behavior in
response to the CDK4 inhibitor. Although we observed
an initial inhibition of tumor growth in all tumors (Figure
6), after ending the treatment, the different sarcomas
behaved very differently. The tumors expressing high
CDK4 levels (S11 and S16) responded to the drug (figure
6). S16-derived tumors stop growing and even reduced in
size in response to the treatment; as result, all treated mice
survived. Alternatively, the S11-derived tumors responded
to CDK4 inhibition by greatly delaying tumor growth;
as a result, the treated mice survived almost twofold
longer than the untreated mice (Figure 6). However, the
two tumors expressing high p16ink4a and normal CDK4
levels, (S23 and S27), showed some initial response to
the CDK4 inhibitor, but after ending the treatment, tumor
growth recovered to an even faster rate than that of the
untreated tumors, and the survival of the treated mice was

Effect of CDK4 inhibition on sarcoma PDXs
To explore the effect of CDK4 inhibition in vivo,
we used PDX models produced from a panel of different
types of sarcoma. We selected 6 tumors from different
tissue origins (Figure 4A). The comparison of the entire
transcriptome of these tumor xenografts to the original
human tumor showed between 93 and 98% similarity
(Figure 4B), indicating that the PDX models were almost
identical to the original human sarcomas. From these
sarcomas, we tested 2 samples expressing high levels of
CDK4 and cyclin D1 (S11 and S16), 2 samples expressing
high p16ink4a levels (S23 and S27), and two samples
expressing normal levels of CDK4, low levels of cyclin
D1 and no detectable p16ink4a (S14 and S29) (Figure 4C).
The sarcomas were subcutaneously engrafted and grown
until all tumors reached 50 mm3 in volume. Then, the
animals were treated with palbociclib. On the day after
the final dose, mice harboring each tumor subtype treated
with solvent (untreated) or with palbociclib (treated) were
sacrificed, and the tumors analyzed for the expression of
KI67, a marker of proliferation (Figure 5A). We found
a variable effect of to palbociclib administration on the
different sarcomas. Whereas some PDXs such as S11, S14
and S23 displayed a clear decrease in proliferation, others

very similar to that of the untreated controls (Figure 6).
Finally, the two tumors expressing normal CDK4 levels
but low p16ink4a levels showed heterogeneous responses.
The MPNST-derived S14 PDXs responded to CDK4
inhibition with a clear reduction in tumor growth rate, and
we even observed one tumor that disappeared in a mouse
that survived. Alternatively, the S29-leiomiosarcoma
responded initially to the CDK4 inhibitor, but after ending
the treatment, tumor growth recovered, and the survival of
the treated mice was only slightly longer than that of the
untreated controls (Figure 6). We do not know whether a
second round of treatment with palbociclib would have
been more efficacious in these sarcomas because all of
them appeared to respond to the first round of treatment;
however, in some samples (S29), we did not observe a
clear decrease in the expression of the proliferation marker
KI67 (Figure 5). These data agree with the in vitro cellular
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

data, suggesting that tumors expressing high CDK4 levels
respond more strongly to palbociclib.
At the end of the experiment, we collected all
growing tumors and analyzed the levels of different
proteins that may be involved in the response and/or the
re-growth of the sarcoma. This could help us to determine
whether molecular drift occurred in these tumors in
response to the treatment and to identify possible drug
resistance mechanisms. The tumors, either treated or
untreated, from the same initial engraft were individually
processed, and the levels of certain cell cycle proteins were
analyzed (Figure 7 shows 3 representative untreated and
treated tumors from the 5 models in which we detected
re-growth of the treated sarcomas).
We observed that, in general, untreated tumors
maintained or even increased their levels of CDK4,
whereas most treated counterparts showed greatly reduced

levels of this protein (Figure 7). We also observed some
heterogeneity among the treated tumors, including some
tumors that expressed high CDK4 levels, indicating the
independent evolution of individual clones. We did not
detect any association of palbociclib treatment with the
behavior of phospho-pRb, measured at three independent
sites, as high heterogeneity in the pRb levels was observed
among clones. In our case, an increase in the pRb level
appears not to be a determinant of treated tumor regrowth. Similar results were obtained in the site of CDK4
phosphorylation of p30, other pocket protein of pRb family.
Similarly, we did not detect any association of the p16ink4a,
cyclin D1 or CDK2 levels with the re-growth of treated
tumors (Figure 7). Surprisingly, only an increase in p21cip1
expression was observed in the tumors in treated animals
xenografted with responsive sarcomas (S14 and S11).

the CDK4 pathway for cancer therapy. Several selective
CDK4/6 inhibitors are currently in development, and
these agents appear to be better tolerated than previous
generations of CDK4 inhibitors. Three oral selective
CDK4 inhibitors have entered clinical trials: palbociclib
(PD0332991), LEE011, and LY2835219. CDK4 inhibitors
display in vitro activity against a broad range of cancers
and antitumor activity in patients with breast cancer,
lymphoma, sarcoma, and other tumors [31, 60, 61].
Major efforts are underway to develop biomarkers of
the treatment response and to understand the potential
mechanisms underlying resistance to CDK4 inhibitors
[31, 61].
To study the effect of CDK4 inhibition in sarcoma, a
tumor type with few therapeutic approaches, we examined
the effects of the CDK4 inhibitor palbociclib on sarcoma
cell lines and PDX models. Treating these sarcoma
tumors with the CDK4 inhibitor palbociclib revealed
that tumors expressing high levels of CDK4 mRNA, but
not those expressing low CDK4 and high p16INK4a levels,
responded to palbociclib. On the other hand, we have

found that CDK4-R24C mutant increases resistance to
the drug. Since the only known phenotype associated to
the R24C mutation is the insensitivity to Ink4 inhibitors
the mechanistic basis of this result is unclear. Palbociclib
selectively binds the ATP binding site of the CDK4/6cyclin D complex. It is possible that mutation in R24C of
CDK4 slightly disturbs the ATP-binding pocket providing
lower affinity of palbociclib for mutant CDK4, thus
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

rendering this protein more resistant to its inhibition. We
think that further crystallography studies with the mutant
vs WT CDK4 proteins bound to the drug are necessary.
It has been reported that the efficacy of CDK4
inhibitors requires that the tumor cell express a normally
functioning pRb. If there is loss of the intact pRb, then
the G1 checkpoint becomes unrestricted, rendering the
proliferation of malignant cells CDK4/6-independent

and thus resistant to treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors.
However, some cell lines expressing an intact pRb exhibit
CDK4/6 inhibition insensitivity, suggesting that other
escape mechanisms exist [31]. Increased levels of p16INK4a
may serve as a marker of pRb deficiency [62, 63]. In our
hands, in vivo studies suggest that high levels of p16ink4a
are a marker of poor response to palbociclib, even in the
presence of active pRb in the tumors as demonstrated by
its phosphorylation as diverse sites (Figure 7).
In our in vivo study, a molecular pattern was
related to the response to a CDK4 inhibitor. Whereas two
sarcomas expressing high CDK4 levels responded (S11
and S16), the two sarcomas expressing high p16INK4a and
normal CDK4 levels showed a poor response and early
recovery from treatment. However, among the tumors
with normal CDK4 levels but low p16INK4a, there was
some heterogeneity, as one tumor appeared to respond
(MPNST-S14) but the other (Leiomiosarcoma-S29)
showed similar levels of senescence markers to those
in S14; however, the treatment response and the KI67
expression results were unclear. It is possible that
leiomyosarcomas in general or this specific tumor are
refractory to the drug in vivo. It is also possible that under
possible limiting molecular conditions (normal CDK4
medium/low cyclin D and low p16INK4a), the response
is worse than under conditions of the complete absence
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of p16INK4a. However, although we did not observe a
correlation with tissue origin in the cell line results
(data not shown), the observations that both responsive
tumors originated from myxofibrosarcomas and that
both clear nonresponders originated from pleomorphic
sarcomas suggest that some tumor type-related effect
on the treatment response is possible. Thus, additional
experiments examining a large cohort of these tumor types
are necessary. In line with the results of the responsive
MPNST-S14 sample, it is worth mentioning that MPNSTs
are sensitive to sorafenib, probably due to the inhibition
of MEK and ERK, the suppression of cyclin D1, and
the hypophosphorylation of pRb at CDK4-specific sites,
resulting in cell cycle arrest [64]. The available evidence
suggests that sorafenib, by inhibiting the MAPK pathway,
inhibits CDK4 and that this drug may serve as a novel
treatment for patients with MPNST.
As previously mentioned, increased levels of
p16INK4a may serve as a marker of pRb deficiency [62, 63].
However, high levels of p16INK4a exist also in some tumors
with wild type pRb as in those carrying HPV (E7 protein
targets pRb), or that over express MDM2 [65], commonly
co-amplified with CDK4 in sarcomas. However, in
cells, we did not observe a significant correlation of the
treatment response with high p16INK4a levels (Figure 3),
and we detected pRb in all tumors (Figures 5 and 7).

Figure 7: Levels of different cell cycle-related proteins in the sarcomas grown in untreated or treated mice. At the end of
the experiment, we collected all growing tumors and analyzed the levels of different proteins that may be involved in the response and/or
the re-growth of the sarcoma. The tumors from the same initial engraft in both the treated or untreated groups were individually processed,
and the levels of certain cell cycle proteins were analyzed. Western blots for CDK4, cyclin D1, phosphor-pRb (at Ser807/811; at S780; at
S795), CDK2, p21waf1, p16ink4a, phospho-p130 (at S762), phospho-p107 (at S975) and a-tubulin (loading control) are shown. The figure
shows 3 representative untreated and treated tumors from the 5 models in which we observed re-growth of the treated sarcomas.

On the other hand, we did not observe a clear
increase in pRb in tumors re-grown from treated tumors
or an increase in p16INK4a protein, indicating that other
mechanisms of resistance also exist. Interestingly, we
detected an increase in p21waf1 expression in tumors regrown from treated tumors compared to the corresponding
untreated tumors (figure 7). At this point, do not know
whether this increase is mechanistically shutting down
the cell cycle and inducing delayed tumor growth or only
accompanies the remaining tumor, which re-grows during
the recovery period.
Therefore, it appears that palbociclib can be applied
to other sarcoma types, especially those expressing high
CDK4 levels and low p16INK4a levels. Similar data has been
reported recently for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans [46].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Increased CDK4 activity due to activating
mutations, gene amplification, or the inhibition of CDK4inhibitory signals via the silencing of p16INK4a has been
suggested as a tumor-initiating and/or tumor-promoting
event in different tumor types. The amplification of
CDK4, located on chromosome 12q13-14, has been
reported in sarcomas, glioblastomas and breast cancers
[66–69]. Activating CDK4 mutations have been reported
in melanoma [70]. Both genomic events can lead to
increased CDK4 signaling. Based on the accumulating
evidence that CDK4 gene alterations are associated with
the proliferation of different tumor types, CDK4 inhibitors
are currently being studied in clinical trials.
Activating CDK4 mutations are less frequently
reported in tumors than CDK4 gene amplification, and not
40567

reported in sarcoma tumors. Our data suggest that tumors
carrying these mutants may not be suitable for treatment
with palbociclib.
The amplification of chromosome 12q13-15
has been well documented in different sarcomas [66,
71–73]. Although it was originally thought that CDK4
is co-amplified with other Chr 12q13-15 genes, such
as MDM2, it appears that different genes within this
region are amplified dependent on the sarcoma subtype
[74–76]. CDK4 gene amplification is commonly reported
in atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated
liposarcomas, de-differentiated liposarcomas, and bone
tumors. The overexpression of CDK4 was found to
correspond to the gene amplification status and has been
shown to be an especially useful marker for identifying
well-differentiated and de-differentiated liposarcomas
[77]. CDK4 amplification is correlated with a significantly
poorer progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-free
survival of liposarcoma [78]. Furthermore, in a small
number of MPNSTs, or neurosarcomas, CDK4 gene
amplification and subsequent increased CDK4 expression
are significant predictors of poor patient survival [79].
Very little is known about whether genomic
alterations in CDK4 can predict the tumor response to
CDK inhibitors. Whereas the loss of p16ink4a function
has been consistently associated with sensitivity to CDK
inhibitors, at least in preclinical settings, the association of
increased CDK4 activity with increased drug sensitivity
remains unclear. No completed study has demonstrated
that activating CDK4 mutations affect the sensitivity of
tumors or tumor cells to CDK inhibitors independently of
12q13-15 amplification. Preclinical and clinical studies
of liposarcoma suggested that the amplification of CDK4
may predict an increased response to CDK4 inhibitors [43,
44, 80]. However, CDK4 amplification or overexpression
predicted either CDK inhibitor resistance or showed
no association with the drug response in tumor models
of glioblastoma and melanoma [81]. Our data support
a positive role of high CDK4 levels in the response to
CDK4 inhibitors. There are ongoing trials designed to
test the utility of CDK4 genomic alterations in predicting
the tumor response to CDK inhibitors. It should be noted
that CDK inhibitors are not expected to be effective for
tumors lacking pRb or overexpressing wild-type p16ink4a
[61]. A phase II study demonstrated that the treatment of
liposarcoma patients with palbociclib is associated with
favorable PFS in tumors displaying pRb expression and
CDK4 amplification [44]. Patients treated with palbociclib
demonstrated 66% PFS, which significantly exceeded the
primary study endpoint and included one partial response.
Alternatively, indirectly supporting the data
suggesting CDK4 inhibition as suitable therapeutic
strategy for sarcoma, in a phase 1 clinical trial, flavopiridol
and doxorubicin combination therapy resulted in a disease
control rate of 67% in progressive non-chemotherapyresponsive liposarcoma with likely CDK4 amplification
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[80]. The majority of patients exhibited stable disease at
12 and 24 weeks (PFS12weeks and PFS24weeks), which is a
favorable response rate in this patient population. In vivo
sarcoma xenografts harboring CDK4 amplification also
show significant responses to flavopiridol either as a single
agent or in combination with doxorubicin.
In summary, our data support the efficacy of
CDK4 inhibitors for sarcomas displaying increased
CDK4 expression in general, particularly liposarcomas.
Additionally, our results suggest that high levels of
p16ink4a may indicate a poor effect of these drugs on the
tumor. Additionally, we show that tumors harboring active
mutant CDK4R24C may respond poorly to palbociclib but
may be suitable targets for other CDK4 inhibitors such
as flavopiridol. Our data reinforce previously published
data on the suitability of CDK4 inhibition for cell cycledependent tumors and support the performance of new
molecularly directed clinical trials for other types of
sarcoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tumor samples
Tumor tissues were obtained via the surgical
resection of sarcomas performed at Virgen del Rocio
Hospital (Seville, Spain). All patients provided written
informed consent according to a protocol approved by the
local ethics committee (CEI 2013/PI002). The experiments
were performed according to the European guidelines for
laboratory animal care. This study was approved by the
IBIS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

PDX generation
Sarcoma tissue samples were obtained from a
single tumor area and were preserved in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium nutrient mixture/F10
(DMEM/F12; Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, penicillin, streptomycin and Amphotericin B
(100 mg/ml each; Sigma). The samples were maintained
for less than 2 hours in cell culture medium at room
temperature before implantation. Each tissue was
divided into 2 parts. One part was frozen, and the
remaining part was cut into small fragments of 2–3 mm
in diameter and used for subcutaneous implantation
into 6-week-old Foxn1nu athymic nude female mice
(Harlan Laboratories, Netherlands). Upon reaching a
size of 1,500 mm3, the mice were euthanized, and the
tumors were re-grown in a similar fashion to perform
the indicated experiments.

In vivo treatments
To initiate the experiments, each sample was
xenografted into mice. Once the tumors reached 1500
40568

mm3, the tumors were harvested, cut into 2 × 2 × 2 mm
blocks and implanted. The experiments were performed
using cohorts of 6 animals. Mice were randomly allocated
to the drug-treated and control-treated (solvent only)
groups, and once the tumor grew to 20 mm3, the mice
were treated for 3 weeks (5 days/eek). The mice were
monitored daily for signs of distress and were weighed
twice a week. The tumor size was measured using a
caliper according to the following equation: tumor
volume = [length x width2]/2. The experiments were
terminated when the tumor reached 1500 mm3. The
drug (Palbociclib, PD0332991), was obtained from
Pfizer, freshly prepared and orally administered. The
concentration used in human is 125mg/dose. We have used
higher doses in mice assuming a 70Kg average weight in
humans. We have used 100 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to
2 mg/dose approximately, averaging 25 gr body weights
each mice). This is equal or lower than the dose used in
other xenograft studies but correspond to a 40 fold higher
than the concentration used in humans. We have not found
signs of toxicity.

in blocking solution (PBS containing 3% bovine serum
albumin) at 37°C for 1 hour, followed by incubation for
2 hours at room temperature in an anti-53BP1 antibody
(Novus Biologicals, NB100-304) diluted 1:100. After
washing with PBS, the cells were incubated in a speciesspecific Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody diluted
1:500 in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature
in the dark. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI,
and the slides were mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade
reagent (Life Technologies). The samples were visualized
under a confocal ultra-spectral microscope (Leica TCSSP2-AOBS-UV) via sequential scanning of the emission
channels. The mean fluorescence intensity was measured
for a minimum of 300 cells per condition using Leica
confocal imaging software. The plotted values represent
the means (±SD) of each condition. Statistical significance
was calculated using Student’s t-test.

Senescence-associated ß-galactosidase activity
Senescence-associated
(SA)
ß-galactosidase
(ß-Gal) activity was measured as previously described
[52], except that the cells were incubated in 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl-ß-D-galactopyranoside (XGal) at pH 5.5
to increase the sensitivity of the assay. The percentage of
cells expressing SA ß-Gal was quantified by inspecting >
300 cells in each o three independent experiments.

Western blot analyses
Western blot analyses were performed as previously
described [50, 51]. Briefly, the cells were washed twice
with PBS and lysed via sonication in lysis buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1% NP-40; 1 mM Na3VO4; 150
mM NaCl; 20 mM Na4P2O7; 100 mM NaF; 1% Nadeoxycholate; 0.1% SDS; 1 mM EDTA; phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma)). The samples were separated on 6–15% SDSPAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(Protran BA83, Whatman) and immunostained. The
following primary antibodies and dilutions were used:
Anti-p21 [C-19] 1:200 (Santa Cruz, #sc-397), anti-p53
[FL-393] 1:200 (Santa Cruz, #sc-6243), Anti-p16 (M156) 1:200 (Santa Cruz, #sc-1207), anti-pRb 1:500 (BDPharmingen), anti-phospho-pRb (Ser807/811) 1:1000
(Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-histone H2A.X (Ser139)
1:1000 (Millipore 05–636) and monoclonal anti-α-tubulin
1:1000 (Sigma 9026). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled
rabbit anti-mouse (Amersham, diluted 1:3000) and goat
anti-rabbit (Abcam, #6721, diluted 1:3000) secondary
antibodies were used. The proteins were visualized using
an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).

KI67 staining
From each paraffin block, consecutive 5-μm tissue
sections were cut, mounted, and dried on glass slides.
The tissues were deparaffinized in xylol, followed by
dehydration in graded alcohol solutions. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked using DAKO Blocking
Solution (Agilent Technologies, United States) for 20
minutes at room temperature. Nonspecific protein binding
was saturated using a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
solution containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% bovine
serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 hour at room
temperature. A mouse anti-human Ki-67 primary antibody
(clone MIB-1; DAKO, Agilent technologies, United
States) was used. The primary antibody was applied to
tissue sections, and the slides were incubated overnight
at 4°C. A secondary antibody (Envision/HRI Dako SM
802) was applied for 1 hour at room temperature, and the
immunocomplexes were revealed using Substrate Buffer
SM 803 DAB and the chromogen DM 827 (ENVISION
FLEX DAKO). The tissues were counterstained with
hematoxylin (Dako), rehydrated in a graded alcohol series,
and mounted using coverslips.

Quantitative mRNA determination
Total RNA was isolated via cell lysis in Qiazol
reagent using an RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc.). First-strand
cDNA synthesis was performed using 2.0 μg of RNA,
40569

random primers, a dNTP mix and Multiscribe Reverse
Transcriptase in a total volume of 50 μl (High Capacity
Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems). The series of
conditions used for RT-PCR were as follows: 10 min at
25°C, 120 min at 37°C, and 5 min at 95°C.
To measure human CDK4, cyclin D1 and p16
expression, real-time PCR was performed using an ABI
7900HT PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The qPCR
reactions were performed in 384-well plates via TaqMan
Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems). Gadph
expression was examined as internal control. The relative
mRNA quantities were expressed as 2-ßCt. Relative
mRNA quantification and statistical analysis of qPCR
data were conducted using RQ Manager 1.2.1 software
(Applied Biosystems).

Transfection
Subconfluent AW and AX cells were transfected
using the Lipofectamine method (Effectene, Qiagen)
with 0.4 μg of the empty mammalian expression
plasmid pCMV6-neo or pCMV6-neo containing
either the wild type CDK4 gene (Origene) or the
R24C mutant CDK4 gene [55]. At 24 hours after
transfection, the AW and AX cell lines were cultured
in F-10 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.8
mg/ml G418.

Cytotoxicity assay

Complementary RNA microarray assembly,
hybridization, and analysis

Palbociclib was freshly prepared as a 30 mM stock
solution in sterilized deionized water for each experiment.
Palbociclib was applied to a 96-well master plate at
decreasing concentrations of 1/3, such that 300 μM was
the highest concentration studied. The cell lines were
seeded in 96-well plates (5,000–10,000 cells per well,
depending on the cell size). At 24 hours after seeding,
treatment was applied for 96 hours. Cell proliferation was
determined by MTT assay and confirmed by crystal violet
staining [56]. The IC50 was calculated using GraphPad
Prism software.

To investigate the transcriptional profiles of
the samples, we used a GeneChip PrimeView and
a Human Gene Expression Array GeneChip 3 IVT
PLUS Reagent Kit (Affymetrix, USA). Total RNA
(100 ng) was used for a reverse transcription reaction
in the presence of a poly(A) binding proteins to
generate gene expression profiles from mRNA. RNA
amplification is based upon linear amplification and
employs T7 in vitro transcription (IVT) technology.
In the second step, single-stranded cDNA is converted
to double-stranded cDNA, which acts as a template
for in vitro transcription. The reaction uses DNA
polymerase and RNase H to simultaneously degrade
the RNA and synthesize second-strand cDNA. Labeled
complementary RNA (cRNA) was synthesized and
amplified via IVT of the second-stranded cDNA
template using T7 RNA polymerase, followed by
purification, fragmentation, and hybridization to
the GeneChip PrimeView array. Hybridization was
performed in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 645
instrument at a temperature to 45°C with rotation
at 60 RPM for 16 hours, followed by washing in the
GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 and scanning using a
laser scanner (GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G, Affymetrix).
Finally, the data were collected using Expression
Console software.

Apoptotic assay
Cells were cultured for 16 h, and then, 10 μM
palbociclib was added. Untreated cells were used as
negative controls to define the basal level of apoptotic
and necrotic or dead cells. After 48 h, the cells were
stained using the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection
kit (Immunostep) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, the cells were washed in PBS and
resuspended in Annexin-binding buffer, which included
propidium iodide (PI) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/
ml. Then, Annexin V-FITC was added, and the cells were
incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature (25°C) in
the dark. After incubation, 400 μl of Annexin-binding
buffer were added, and the cells were analyzed via flow
cytometry within one hour using a BD FACS Canto II flow
cytometer. The data were analyzed using BD FACS DIVA
Software v 8.0.
