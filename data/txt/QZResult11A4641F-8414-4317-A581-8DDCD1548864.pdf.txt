in this process (7, 8). In cellular assays, MRP4 is able to confer
resistance to a variety of nucleoside-based agents, including
the anticancer nucleobase analogues, 6-mercaptopurine and
6-thioguanine, the antiviral nucleotide analogue, 9¶-(2¶-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-adenine (PMEA), and other antiviral agents
such as the nucleoside analogue ganciclovir and possibly
3¶-azido-3¶-deoxythymidine (9–14). In addition, MRP4 is widely
distributed in tissues (7), an expression pattern which suggests that
the pump has the potential to broadly affect drug accumulation.
MRP4 is also expressed at locations which are involved in drug
disposition and penetration into anatomic sanctuary sites, such as
the apical (luminal) surfaces of kidney proximal tubules and brain
capillaries, and the basolateral surface of hepatocytes (15–17).
These properties suggest that MRP4 may affect the accumulation of
nucleoside-based agents into tissues, and possibly their penetration
into sanctuary sites, and elimination from the body. However,
with the exception of a report showing that Mrp4 restricts the
penetration of topotecan into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (16),
little is known about the in vivo pharmacologic functions of the
pump. Notably, the ability of MRP4 to affect tissue chemosensitivity
has not been explored to any extent.
Here, we investigate the in vivo pharmacologic function of MRP4,
using Mrp4 / mice as a model system, and PMEA, one of the best
characterized drug substrates of MRP4, as a probe. The results
show that Mrp4 protects the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and
intestine from PMEA-induced damage, and that the pump also
restricts the penetration of PMEA into the brain. This is the first
demonstration that an efflux pump is able to function as an in vivo
resistance factor for a nucleoside-based agent.

Abstract
Nucleoside-based analogues are mainstays in the treatment of
cancer, viral infections, and inflammatory diseases. Recent
studies showing that the ATP-binding cassette transporter,
multidrug resistance protein 4, is able to efflux nucleoside and
nucleotide analogues from transfected cells suggests that the
pump may affect the efficacy of this class of agents. However,
the in vivo pharmacologic functions of the pump are largely
unexplored. Here, using Mrp4 / mice as a model system, and
the nucleotide analogue, 9¶-(2¶-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) as a probe, we investigate the ability of Mrp4
to function in vivo as an endogenous resistance factor. In the
absence of alterations in plasma PMEA levels, Mrp4-null mice
treated with PMEA exhibit increased lethality associated with
marked toxicity in several tissues. Affected tissues include the
bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and gastrointestinal tract. In
addition, PMEA penetration into the brain is increased in
Mrp4 / mice. These findings indicate that Mrp4 is an
endogenous resistance factor, and that the pump may be a
component of the blood-brain barrier for nucleoside-based
analogues. This is the first demonstration that an ATP-binding
cassette transporter can affect in vivo tissue sensitivity towards
this class of agents. [Cancer Res 2007;67(1):262–8]

Introduction
Nucleoside-based drugs are mainstays in the treatment of
cancer, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections. Factors that
govern the intracellular accumulation of these agents may limit
their efficacy by restricting penetration into tumors, inflammatory
cells, and infected tissues, and by functioning as a pharmacologic
barrier at anatomic sanctuary sites (1). This notion is well
established for natural product anticancer agents, for which
MRP1 is an endogenous resistance factor, and P-glycoprotein
restricts oral bioavailability and penetration into the brain and
fetus (2–6). In contrast with natural product agents, the
involvement of primary active transporters in the in vivo
pharmacology of nucleoside-based analogues is not well defined.
Recent in vitro studies in our laboratory and others have implicated
multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4; gene symbol ABCC4), a
member of the C family of ATP-binding cassette transporters,

Materials and Methods
Generation of Mrp4 gene–disrupted mice. A 500 bp fragment of the
5¶ end of the mouse Mrp4 coding sequence was used to screen a mouse
strain 129–derived E phage genomic library. Five overlapping clones
spanning 29 kb and including three upstream exons of the Mrp4 gene were
isolated and characterized. A targeting vector was designed to delete
sequences corresponding to amino acids 77 to 101 of Mrp4. To create the
5¶ arm of the targeting vector, an EcoRI-XhoI fragment was cloned into
corresponding sites of the Bluescript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA),
the XhoI site was modified by the addition of an XhoI-SpeI-XhoI adaptor,
and the fragment was reintroduced into the SmaI and SpeI sites of
Bluescript using an internal SspI site and the SpeI site from the adaptor.
The 3.6 kb fragment was then excised from Bluescript using flanking EcoRI
and XbaI sites and inserted into corresponding sites of the PNT vector. To
create the 3¶ arm, a 3.7 kb XhoI-EcoRI fragment was cloned into the
corresponding sites in the Bluescript vector, the XhoI site and a flanking
NotI site were used to subclone the fragment into corresponding sites of
PNT. The targeting vector was digested with NotI and linearized DNA was

Mice Are Hypersensitive to PMEA

pharmacokinetic properties of PMEA, a combined i.v. loading dose
(20 mg/kg) and constant rate infusion (20 mg/kg/h) regimen of probenecid
was administered to individual mice of both strains. This regimen
was estimated to attain steady-state probenecid plasma concentrations
of f50 Ag/mL. After 2 h of the constant rate infusion of probenecid, a
single 25 mg/kg i.v. bolus dose of PMEA was administered. The probenecid
infusion was continued for an additional 6 h during a blood sampling
period analogous to that used for the single-dose PMEA study described
above. Probenecid plasma concentrations were measured just prior to the
administration of PMEA and at 360 min, the last time point.
For steady-state pharmacokinetic measurements of brain PMEA
concentrations, specific steady-state dosing regimens of PMEA were
designed to achieve plasma concentrations of 5 Ag/mL for each mouse
strain, based on the results from the single-dose PMEA pharmacokinetic
studies. C57BL/6J wild-type mice received a loading dose of 3.83 mg/kg of
PMEA and a constant rate infusion of 0.235 mg/kg/min for 3 h, whereas
Mrp4 / mice were given a loading dose of 3.82 mg/kg of PMEA and
constant rate infusion of 0.217 mg/kg/min for 3 h. Approximately 30 AL of
blood was collected at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min during the infusions, after
which the animals were immediately sacrificed and brain tissue was

electroporated into strain 129–derived R1 embryonic stem cells. Individual
colonies isolated following positive/negative selection with G418 and
ganciclovir were screened by Southern blot analysis using a 5¶ probe and
genomic DNA digested with BamHI, and a 3¶ probe and DNA digested with
Hind III. The absence of randomly integrated vector sequences was
confirmed by Southern blot analysis using a neo probe. Two correctly
targeted ES cell lines were injected into C57/BL6 blastocysts, and the
blastocysts were implanted in pseudopregnant females. Male chimeric
progeny were crossed with female C57BL/6J mice (bred in-house). Germ
line transmission of the targeted allele was confirmed by Southern blot
analysis and subsequent genotyping was accomplished by PCR analysis of
tail DNA. The latter reaction was carried out in a single tube using three
primers: 5¶-ggggactgaactccagatgtctgcaac-3¶, 5¶-cggcagtcctactgttcctga-3¶, and
5¶-gggccagctcattcctcccactca-3¶. The former two primers generate a 360 bp
wild-type product, and the latter two generate a 270-bp product from the
targeted allele.
Animal handling, blood chemistries, and hematology. Animals were
maintained in the Fox Chase laboratory animal facility and housed in
a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment under 12-h light/
dark cycles. Mice were fed a standard rodent diet (Lab Diet 5013, PMI
Nutrition, Brentwood, MO) and had free access to water. The Fox Chase
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the protocol.
Peripheral blood was obtained by orbital bleeding of anesthetized mice.
Blood chemistry and hematologic variables were determined at Antech
Diagnostics (Farmingdale, NY).
Immunoblot analysis. Crude membrane preparations were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
Mrp4 was detected using a previously described rabbit polyclonal Mrp4
antibody (18).
Histopathology and drug sensitivity analysis. Mrp4 / mice on a
mixed C57BL/6J  129 background were used for histopathologic studies
and drug sensitivity experiments. Histopathologic analysis of Mrp4-null
mice revealed normal heart, lungs, thymus, spleen, bone marrow, forestomach, stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, pancreas, kidneys, ureter,
bladder, testes, ovaries, uterus, and brain. For drug sensitivity experiments,
age-matched male mice (n = 6) were treated with single i.p. injections of
PMEA, and observed daily for a period of 2 weeks. For analysis of weight
progression and WBC counts, groups of male mice (n = 4) were treated with
PMEA at 2 g/kg body weight. Mice were weighed and blood samples (20 AL)
were taken by orbital bleeding, for a period of 5 days. WBC counts were
analyzed using a Coulter Z1 Series Particle Counter (Beckman Coulter,
Miami, FL). For histologic analysis, mice were euthanized 3 days after being
treated with 2 g/kg of PMEA. Tissues were harvested and fixed in 10%
phosphate-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained
with H&E.
Pharmacokinetic measurements. Adult male (f25 g body weight)
C57BL/6J wild-type and Mrp4-null mice backcrossed for seven generations
to C57BL/6J were used for all pharmacokinetic studies. Mice were
anesthetized with a 3:2:1 mixture of ketamine hydrochloride/acepromazine
maleate/xylazine hydrochloride (100:10:20 mg/mL), followed by the
implantation of a right common carotid artery and a jugular vein cannula
(0.28 mm inside diameter and 0.64 outside diameter; SCI Micro Medical
Tubing), which were used for blood sampling and drug administration,
respectively. The cannulas were secured and exteriorized at the back of the
neck. Animals were conscious for the pharmacokinetic studies, having been
allowed to recover for at least 12 h before being placed at the start of the
study in individual metabolism cages, which facilitated collection of urine.
For single-dose pharmacokinetic experiments, groups (n = 6–8) of each
mouse strain received either 5 or 25 mg/kg of PMEA, dissolved in isotonic
phosphate buffer (13.5 mmol/L KH2PO4 and 62.5 mmol/L Na2HPO4), by i.v.
injection over 1 min. Serial blood samples (20 AL each) were collected at 2,
5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min, after which plasma was
separated from blood and then stored at 80jC until analyzed by highpressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described below. Urine was
collected on dry ice for f6 h, which enabled renal clearance to be
estimated. The total volume of urine was measured and stored at 80jC
until analyzed by HPLC. To examine the effects of probenecid on the

concentration-time profile using maximum likelihood optimization with a
fractional SD variance model as implemented in the SAAM II program (20).
Each best-fit model yielded a set of model variables that were used to
calculate primary pharmacokinetic variables of total systemic clearance,
volume of distribution at steady-state, and the elimination half-life of
PMEA. Renal clearance was determined by dividing the total amount of
PMEA excreted in the urine in 6 h by the area under the plasma
concentration-time curve over the same time period. For brain PMEA
experiments, individual steady-state brain/plasma PMEA concentration
ratios were calculated.
Statistical analyses. Body weights and WBC counts were analyzed using
the Student’s t test. Mouse survival data were modeled using logistic
regression. The model included PMEA dose, mouse type, and their
interaction. An ANOVA was completed to determine if there were statistical
differences (P < 0.05) between the pharmacokinetic variables as a function
of dose and species and probenecid coadministration. Differences in brain/
plasma PMEA concentrations were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA.

collected. Tissues were rapidly frozen with dry ice and stored at 80jC until
analyzed by HPLC.
HPLC analysis of PMEA and probenecid. HPLC analysis of PMEA was
based on a previously published method developed for human plasma that
used a derivatization step and fluorescence detection (19). Plasma, urine,
and brain tissue samples were prepared as follows: for analysis of PMEA
in plasma, each 10 AL aliquot was mixed with 100 AL of methanol by
vortexing for 1 min. After centrifugation for 3 min at 15,000 rpm, the
supernatant was evaporated under nitrogen at room temperature for
40 min. One hundred microliters of 0.5% chloroacetaldehyde (derivitization
reagent) in 0.1 mol/L sodium acetate (pH 4.5) was added to the residue, and
the solution was incubated at 90jC for 40 min followed by centrifugation at
15,000 rpm for 1 min. A 20 AL aliquot of the supernatant was injected onto
the HPLC system. For analysis of PMEA in urine, each 10 AL aliquot was
mixed with 990 AL of water, and 10 AL of the mixture was added to 100 AL
of 0.5% derivatization reagent. The solution was then incubated and
processed as described for plasma. For the analysis of PMEA in brain tissue,
each aliquot of 60 AL of brain homogenate (10%, 1 g tissue:9 mL water) was
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, followed by the addition of 100 AL of
0.5% derivitization reagent to 40 AL of supernatant. The solution was then
incubated and processed as described for plasma.
PMEA was separated on a C8 column (5 Am, 150  4.6 mm; Phenomenex
Hypersil 5) using a mobile phase of 15:85 acetonitrile/water (5 mmol/L
sodium phosphate, 5 mmol/L tetrabutylammonium chloride, pH 6.93) at a
flow rate of 0.9 mL/min. These conditions afforded PMEA a retention time
of 5.8 min; however, the total run time was set at 20 min to ensure the
elimination of all endogenous materials between sample injections. The
fluorometer was set at an excitation wavelength of 236 nm, with an
emission wavelength of 420 nm. The HPLC method had a wide linear range
from 10 ng/mL to 67.2 Ag/mL in plasma and urine and from 42 ng/mL to
55.0 Ag/mL in brain. The assay was accurate and precise with bias and
coefficient of variation percentages of V15%.
For the analysis of probenecid in plasma, aliquots of 10 AL of mouse
plasma were mixed with 10 AL of methanol and 20 AL of acetonitrile by
vortexing for 1 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 3 min, a 20 AL
aliquot of the supernatant was injected onto the HPLC system. Probenecid
was eluted at 4 min on a C18 column (3.5 Am, 4.6 mm  75 mm; Zorbax SB)
using a mobile phase of 40:60 acetonitrile/30 mmol/L KH2PO4 at a flow rate
of 0.9 mL/min, and detected at a wavelength of 244 nm. This method had a
linear range of 2.8 to 91.9 Ag/mL, and was accurate and precise with
percentages of coefficients of variation of <15%.
Pharmacokinetic analyses. A linear two-compartment open pharmacokinetic model was fit to each individual mouse PMEA plasma

Results
Generation of Mrp / mice. To examine the function of MRP4,
an Mrp4-null mouse was generated by homologous recombination in ES cells, using a vector that targeted sequences encoding
amino acids 77 to 101 (Fig. 1A–C). Immunoblot analyses of several
tissues from Mrp4 / mice, including kidney, spleen, small
intestine, and colon confirmed the absence of Mrp4 protein
(Fig. 1D). Mrp4-null mice appeared normal with respect to fertility,
appearance, behavior, serum chemistry, and hematologic variables,
and histopathologic analysis did not reveal any abnormalities
(data not shown).
Mrp4 / mice are hypersensitive to PMEA. To investigate the
in vivo pharmacologic functions of Mrp4, wild-type and Mrp4-null
mice were challenged with the nucleotide analogue PMEA, an
agent with antiproliferative and antiviral activity that is a well
characterized component of the MRP4 drug resistance profile
(10, 11, 21). Mrp4 / mice exhibited increased sensitivity to this
agent, as indicated by the clear separation of the dose-response
curves (Fig. 2A). The minimal toxic dose for Mrp4 / mice was
0.5 g/kg, or 5-fold lower than that of wild-type mice (2.5 g/kg).
The dose at which 50% of Mrp4-null animals died was f50% of
the corresponding dose for wild-type mice. Notably, at 2 g/kg, all

Mrp4-null mice died, whereas all wild-type mice survived. The
increased sensitivity of Mrp4 / mice treated at this dose was
reflected by their inability to maintain body weight, which was
evident as early as 24 h after treatment (Fig. 2B). By day 5, Mrp4 /
mice lost >20% of body weight. By comparison, wild-type mice lost
<5% of body weight at this time point. In addition, the peripheral
white blood depression was prolonged in Mrp4-null mice, with the
nadir reached at day 4, whereas with wild-type mice, the nadir was
reached 1 to 2 days after treatment (Fig. 2C).
Mrp4 protects bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and intestine.
Histopathologic analysis of wild-type and Mrp4 / mice treated
with PMEA revealed striking changes in many tissues of Mrp4 /
mice, whereas in all cases, the corresponding tissues of wild-type
mice appeared completely normal (Figs. 3 and 4). Intense aplasia
was evident in the bone marrow of Mrp4-null animals (Fig. 3A).
Mrp4-null mice also had smaller spleens in which the lymphoid
follicles were diminished in number and size (Fig. 3B). In addition,
erythroid and myeloid cell populations in the red pulp were
decreased and replaced by stromal cells (seen at higher power
magnification; data not shown). In Mrp4 / mice, there was almost
complete lymphocyte depopulation in the cortical regions of the

thymus (Fig. 3C). Marked toxicity was also apparent in the
gastrointestinal tract of Mrp4-null mice (Fig. 4). Acute mucositis
destroyed the epithelium of the forestomach, leaving only the
horny layer and denuded subepithelial tissue in which there were
inflammatory cells and edematous changes (Fig. 4A). In Mrp4-null
animals, the small intestinal villi were decreased in size, and there
were prominent inflammatory infiltrates in the submucosa
(Fig. 4B). In addition, the basal portions of the glands were dilated.
Mrp4 / animals had severe atrophic toxic colitis characterized by
decreased thickness of colonic mucosa, loss of glands, and the
presence of inflammatory infiltrates (Fig. 4C). Mucous microcysts
were also present.

Discussion

combination with its facility for transporting this compound,
suggested that Mrp4 might be involved in the renal elimination of
PMEA. If this were the case, Mrp4-null mice would be expected to
have higher serum levels of PMEA, and the observed chemosensitivity phenotype of Mrp4 / mice could be attributable to
systemic pharmacokinetic alterations as opposed to increased
inherent tissue sensitivity resulting from loss of a cellular
resistance factor. A pharmacokinetic analysis of PMEA was
therefore conducted to ascertain whether Mrp4 is involved in the
renal elimination of PMEA and whether it affects PMEA serum
levels. These experiments showed that neither urinary clearance
nor plasma concentrations of PMEA were altered in Mrp4 /
mice.
When measured at two different PMEA concentrations, the
plasma-time profiles of wild-type and Mrp4 / mice were
indistinguishable (Fig. 5A; profile for 5 mg/kg not shown), and
significant differences were not observed in overall clearance or
urinary clearance in wild-type and Mrp4 / mice (Table 1).
Probenecid, a general inhibitor of organic anion transporters
including MRP4 (15), significantly decreased urinary clearance in
wild-type mice, with a corresponding decrease in total clearance
and an increase in serum PMEA levels (Fig. 5B; Table 1). However,
genetic ablation of Mrp4 in combination with probenecid
treatment did not decrease total clearance or urinary clearance
of PMEA beyond the effect of probenecid on wild-type mice
(Table 1), demonstrating that whereas PMEA urinary elimination is
mediated by organic anion transporters, Mrp4 is not a rate-limiting
component of this probenecid-sensitive system.
Mrp4 restricts PMEA penetration into the brain. Next, the
ability of Mrp4, which was reported to be expressed on the apical
surfaces of brain capillaries (16), to affect the penetration of PMEA
into the brain was analyzed. Under steady-state conditions, Mrp4null mice had 1.8-fold higher brain/plasma ratios of PMEA
compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 5C), implicating Mrp4 in brain
accumulation of PMEA under conditions analogous to those of
a multiple-dose administration schedule that would be used
clinically.

Investigations of cell lines that overexpress MRP4 have
established that the pump is able to confer resistance to a variety
of anticancer and antiviral agents. However, the facility of MRP4 to
confer in vivo resistance has not been determined. To address this
question, we used an approach involving the analysis of toxicity
and pharmacokinetics in Mrp4-null mice treated with PMEA. We
found that Mrp4 / mice do not exhibit obvious abnormalities,
but they are more susceptible than wild-type mice to challenge
with PMEA. This finding, in combination with the absence of
alterations in plasma PMEA levels, provides the first direct
evidence that Mrp4 functions as an in vivo resistance factor. The
striking pattern of toxicity in hematopoietic, lymphopoietic, and
gastrointestinal sites is consistent with the interpretation that
increased lethality in Mrp4-null mice is attributable to neutropenia
that may be exacerbated by the breakdown of the gastrointestinal
barrier to gut flora. Acute toxicity in Mrp4 / mice was confined to
proliferating tissues. This toxicity pattern likely reflects the known
predilection of cytotoxic agents to affect rapidly dividing tissues, as
opposed to being attributable to the restriction of Mrp4 expression
to affected tissues. This notion is supported, respectively, by the
ability of PMEA to inhibit DNA synthesis (21), and by the absence
of apparent toxicity in kidney, a tissue in which Mrp4 is expressed
at levels that are at least comparable to those in tissues that are
susceptible to damage, such as spleen and gut (Fig. 1D). The wide
distribution of MRP4 in the body suggests that the pump is likely
to affect the levels of nucleotide analogues in tissues in which we
did not observe increased toxicity. Our results also suggest that
Mrp4 may affect in vivo sensitivity to other nucleoside-based
analogues that are part of the resistance profile of the pump, such
as the nucleobase and nucleoside analogues 6-mercaptopurine,
6-thioguanine, and ganciclovir. However, it should be borne in
mind that the pump’s in vivo activity towards these agents may
not be entirely analogous to PMEA because, in contrast with PMEA,
which is an amphipathic anion that is a direct substrate of
the pump, it is the nucleotide metabolites of agents such as
6-mercaptopurine, and presumably, ganciclovir that are susceptible

NOTE: PMEA pharmacokinetic variables in wild-type and Mrp4-null mice were determined at 5 and 25 mg/kg (see Materials and Methods for details).
*The values are means F SD except for T 1/2 values which are expressed as the harmonic mean F pseudo SD (n = 6–8 in each group).
cThe effect of probenecid on PMEA pharmacokinetics was analyzed at a steady-state plasma probenecid concentration of f50 Ag/mL, which was
achieved by a dosing regimen consisting of 20 mg/kg probenecid as an i.v. bolus followed by a constant rate infusion of 20 mg/kg/h for 8 h.

to transport by MRP4, as opposed to their uncharged parent
compounds (13). In addition, there may also be considerations that
pertain to the transport kinetics of the pump. Because PMEA is
relatively nontoxic, high concentrations were required to elicit
toxicity in our experiments, and it is possible that the effects of the
pump may be different in experiments employing lower concentrations of more toxic agents. Additional experiments on Mrp4 /
mice should help to clarify whether there are differences in how the
pump affects various agents in vivo. Finally, our results suggest that
previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABCC4
gene might be of pharmacologic significance (24).
Renal disposition of PMEA is of particular interest because
treatment with this agent is associated with delayed nephrotoxicity
(25). Renal elimination of organic anions such as PMEA involves
the concerted action of basolateral transporters that mediate
uptake into renal tubule cells from the peritubular circulation and
apical transporters that mediate extrusion into the urine. Although
Mrp4 is expressed at the apical surfaces of kidney proximal tubules,
and PMEA is predominately eliminated in the urine, reduced renal
clearance of PMEA was not observed in Mrp4 / mice. This
finding, in combination with the susceptibility of renal PMEA
elimination to inhibition by probenecid, suggests that the ratelimiting components of the probenecid-sensitive system responsible for renal excretion of PMEA may be composed of basolateral
organic anion transporters that are capable of transporting PMEA,
such as OAT1 (26), and possibly apical organic anion transporters
other than Mrp4. Although renal clearance of PMEA was not
affected in Mrp4-null mice, it will be of interest to determine
whether these mice have increased susceptibility to delayed renal
toxicity under conditions of chronic administration.
The finding that Mrp4-null mice have increased concentrations
of PMEA in the brain extends the capabilities of Mrp4 that were

inferred from a study showing that Mrp4 restricts brain
accumulation of the anticancer agent topotecan (16). Our experiments suggest that, in addition to certain natural product agents,
the pump may also affect the accumulation of nucleotide
analogues in the brain by functioning as a component of the
blood-brain barrier. Given that the antiretroviral agent PMPA
(tenofovir), which structurally resembles PMEA, and 3¶-azido-3¶deoxythymidine, are likely to be transported by MRP4 (11), this
finding may be relevant with respect to the treatment of AIDS.
With the success of highly active antiretroviral therapy for the
treatment of systemic HIV infection, the inability to eradicate
latent or slowly replicating HIV in the central nervous system has
emerged as a growing concern (27). Our results, in combination
with the role that P-glycoprotein plays at the blood-brain barrier to
limit the penetration of protease inhibitors (28), suggests that the
levels in the brain of two arms of highly active antiretroviral
treatments may be limited by efflux pumps. Similarly, it is possible
that MRP4 may also affect the treatment of cytomegalovirus
retinitis with ganciclovir in patients with AIDS or other forms of
immunocompromise.
