BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is associated with shortened survival and an
increased risk of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy of romiplostim in
patients who had thrombocytopenia with low-risk=intermediate-1–risk MDS. METHODS: Patients who had thrombocytopenia with
low-risk=intermediate-1–risk MDS (N 5 250) were randomized 2:1 to receive romiplostim or placebo weekly for 58 weeks. RESULTS:
The primary endpoint— the number of clinically significant bleeding events (CSBEs) per patient—had a hazard ratio for romiplostim:placebo of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.05; P 5.13). CSBEs were reduced significantly in the romiplostim group for patients
who had baseline platelet counts 20 3 109=L (P <.0001). For patients who had baseline platelet counts <20 3 109=L, there was no
difference in the number of CSBEs, but the platelet transfusion rates were higher in the placebo group (P <.0001), which may have
affected the overall CSBE results in this group with severe thrombocytopenia. The incidence of bleeding events was reduced significantly in the romiplostim group (relative risk, 0.92), as were protocol-defined platelet transfusions (relative risk, 0.77). Platelet
response rates according to 2006 International Working Group criteria were higher for the group that received romiplostim (odds ratio, 15.6). On the basis of interim data, an independent data monitoring committee advised halting study drug because of concerns
regarding excess blasts and AML rates with romiplostim (interim hazard ratio, 2.51). At 58 weeks, the AML rates were 6% in the romiplostim group and 4.9% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-3.84), and the overall survival rates
were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Romiplostim treatment in patients with low-risk=intermediate-1–risk MDS increased platelet counts and
decreased the number of bleeding events and platelet transfusions. Although study drug was discontinued because of an initial conC 2014 Amgen, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
Thrombocytopenia, which is identified in approximately 50% of patients with low-risk=intermediate-1–risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), is associated with shortened survival and an increased risk of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is part of the natural progression of MDS.1-5 In conjunction with abnormal platelet function,
thrombocytopenia contributes to an increased risk of bleeding.6,7 Disease-modifying therapies, such as hypomethylating
agents, can worsen thrombocytopenia and are not necessarily effective. Thus, platelet transfusions are the only treatment
for thrombocytopenia in MDS.
Romiplostim (Nplate; Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif) is a peptibody approved for use in chronic immune
thrombocytopenia.8,9 Results from trials in patients with lower risk MDS suggest that romiplostim, both as monotherapy

Procedures

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients

This phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind
study consisted of a 26-week placebo-controlled treatment period, a 4-week interim washout, followed by a
bone marrow biopsy, a 24-week extended treatment period as randomized, and another 4-week washout, again
followed by a bone marrow biopsy (Fig. 1), followed by
an ongoing, 5-year survival long-term follow-up (LTFU)
period (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00614523).
Eligible patients were adults diagnosed with MDS
according to 2001 World Health Organization (WHO)
criteria who had an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) classification of low risk or intermediate-1 risk
and platelet counts of <20 3 109=L or 20 3 109=L
with a history of bleeding, as determined by the investigator. Patients underwent a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate within 3 months of starting the study. Exclusion
criteria included receiving any MDS disease-modifying
treatments or hematopoietic growth factors within 4
weeks of the study’s start.
The study protocol and related documents were
approved by study center institutional review boards. This

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive weekly subcutaneous romiplostim, starting at a dose of 750 lg, or
volume-matched placebo. Randomization was facilitated
through the interactive voice response system (IVRS) and
was stratified by baseline platelet count (20 3 109=L or
<20 3 109=L) and IPSS rating (low or intermediate-1).
The romiplostim dose could be adjusted in 250-lg increments (from 250 lg every other week to 1000 lg weekly)
or volume-matched placebo on the basis of platelet
counts. Doses were withheld when the platelet count was
>450 3 109=L and were reinitiated at a reduced dose
when the platelet count was <200 3 109=L; if patients
were receiving 250 lg, then the dose was reinitiated every
other week. If the platelet count was <50 3 109=L for the
first 3 consecutive weeks, then the dose was increased to
1000 lg on the fourth week. Patients who had their dose
reduced could increase to the next highest dose if their platelet count was <50 3 109=L for 3 consecutive weeks.
Supportive care, defined as not including treatments
that affected platelet production, aggregation, activation,
granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factors, or
any other investigational agents, was allowed throughout
the study. In the extended treatment period only, patients
1839

Original Article

could receive any standard-of-care MDS treatments. After
completion of the 58-week study period or early discontinuation of study drug, patients entered LTFU.
The primary endpoint was clinically significant
bleeding events (CSBEs) (grade 2 on the modified
WHO bleeding scale16,17). Bleeding for >7 days was
counted as a separate event every eighth day. Multiple
events from the same organ system on the same day were
collapsed into 1 event. Simultaneous bleeding events from
unique organ systems were counted as individual events.
Protocol-defined platelet transfusion events (PTEs) (ie,
platelet transfusions for a bleeding event or platelets
10 3 109=L), overall bleeding, and platelet response
according to 2006 International Working Group Hematologic Improvement-Platelet (HI-P)18 criteria also were
assessed. Overall survival, MDS progression to AML,
adverse events, and antibodies to romiplostim or thrombopoietin were assessed during the 58-week study period,
which included the time in follow-up for patients who
discontinued study drug early.
Romiplostim can be associated with transient blast
cell count elevations in the absence of progression to
AML. The study-defined criteria for progression to AML
included: 1) confirmation of bone marrow or peripheral
blast cells 20%19,20 at least 4 weeks after the last dose of
study drug and at least 2 weeks after the last dose of hematopoietic growth factors; 2) a pathology report confirming
extramedullary AML; or 3) initiation of treatment for
AML, as designated by the investigator. An independent
safety data monitoring committee (DMC) of 3 experts
external to Amgen oversaw patient safety and met semiannually to review safety data generated by an independent statistics group.

according to treatment group at 58 weeks. Hazard ratios
(HRs) with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated using a Cox proportional-hazards model22
stratified by randomization strata. We summarized the
incidence of study-defined progression to AML at 58
weeks. Patient status information was updated with disease progression information obtained from LTFU. Disease progression, as assessed by increases in bone marrow
blasts, was summarized as an exploratory analysis. For
overall duration of bleeding, the relative risk (RR) was calculated from a Poisson regression model with treatment
and stratification factors as covariates. Common odds
ratios (ORs), adjusted for stratification factors, were calculated for HI-P. All patients who were randomized and
received at least 1 dose of investigational product were
included in the analysis. An unblinded interim analysis to
review safety and efficacy data occurred when all enrolled
individuals had completed the test treatment and interim
washout period (week 30) or had terminated the study
early. The final unblinding and analyses were performed
at Amgen Inc.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics

In total, 250 patients were enrolled (romiplostim,
n 5 167; placebo, n 5 83) at 109 sites in the United
States, Canada, and Europe. The treatment groups were
similar with respect to baseline characteristics, except that
the romiplostim group included proportionally more
patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts 1
(RAEB-1) (14% vs 11%) and fewer with unclassified
MDS (MDS-U) (10% vs 15%) (Table 1).
Disposition

Statistical Analysis

A sample size of 240 was planned for this study. The estimated event rate of CSBE was predicted to be 0.053
events per patient per week for the placebo group and
0.035 events per patient per week for the romiplostim
group in the 26-week treatment period. The sample size
was predicted to provide approximately 83% power to
detect a difference in the total number of CSBEs between
groups at a significance level of .05 (2-sided).
The primary endpoint of total number of CSBEs
during the 26-week treatment period was analyzed using
the Andersen-Gill model.8 A Poisson regression model
was used both for secondary analysis and to calculate the
difference between the rates of PTEs and overall bleeding
in each group. We summarized time-to-event endpoints
using Kaplan-Meier estimates21 and survival curves
1840

In February 2011, based on interim data as of October
2010 from 219 patients, the DMC recommended that all
patients discontinue study treatment. The DMC was concerned that transient increases in peripheral blast cell
counts associated with romiplostim put patients at risk for
diagnosis of and treatment for AML and that the potential
benefit of a reduction in bleeding did not outweigh that
risk. All patients discontinued treatment by February 24,
2011, but remained on study for follow-up. All patients
had received at least 1 dose of investigational product.
Seventy patients (41.9%) who received romiplostim and
39 patients (47%) who received placebo completed the
26-week test treatment period and started the extended
treatment period. Because of the DMC recommendation,
69 patients (27.6%) discontinued study drug early,
including 41 in the test treatment period and 28 in the

patients in the romiplostim group and 20 patients in the

Efficacy in the 26-Week Test Treatment Period:
Bleeding and Platelet Transfusions

During the 26-week treatment period, the mean incidence of CSBEs per patient was less with romiplostim
(1.47) than with placebo (1.94; P 5 .13) (Table 2; Supporting Fig. 1 [see online supporting information]). The
number of CSBEs was lower with romiplostim in patients
who had baseline low-risk MDS (HR, 0.48; 95% CI,
0.29-0.79) or a platelet count 20 3 109=L (HR, 0.34;
95% CI, 0.20-0.58) (Supporting Fig. 2; see online supCancer

porting information). The number of all bleeding events
was lower with romiplostim (RR, 0.922; 95% CI, 0.860.99), as was the overall duration (in days) of all bleeding
events (RR, 0.906; 95% CI, 0.87-0.94).
Annualized rates of protocol-defined PTEs, total
transfusions, and total platelet transfusion unit use were
lower with romiplostim (Table 2). The proportions of
therapeutic transfusions (romiplostim, 44.5%; placebo,
49.6%) and prophylactic transfusion (romiplostim,
47.2%; placebo, 45.9%) were similar. An examination of
bleeding and transfusion events by baseline platelet count
indicated that, for patients who had baseline platelet
counts 20 3 109=L, there were nearly 3-fold fewer
CSBEs with romiplostim, without a notable change in the

incidence of PTEs (Table 2). For patients who had baseline platelet counts <20 3 109=L, the CSBE rate was not
different with romiplostim; however, placebo-treated
patients had significantly more PTEs (RR, 0.71 for
romiplostim-treated patients; 95% CI, 0.61-0.82).
After week 4, median platelet counts were consistently higher with romiplostim (P < .001) (Fig. 3A). Of
the patients who were evaluable for HI-P (platelet
response), a greater proportion of those receiving romiplostim had an HI-P (61 of 167 patients [36.5%] in the
romiplostim group vs 3 of 83 patients [3.6%] in the placebo group). Thirty-seven patients (29 in the romiplostim
group and 8 in the placebo group) discontinued treatment
before receiving 8 weeks of study drug and, thus, could
not be assessed for HI-P. The common OR, which was
calculated with all patients included, was 15.6 (95% CI,
4.7-51.8; P < .001). HI-P was increased with romiplostim relative to placebo. Among 64 patients with HI-P (61
in the romiplostim group, 3 in the placebo group), 8
patients (12.5%) had a CSBE, 42 (65.6%) had any bleeding, 14 (21.9%) had a PTE, and 16 (25%) had any platelet transfusion. The proportions of patients who had a
1842

platelet response at any point in time quickly diverged for
the romiplostim and placebo groups (Supporting Fig. 3;
see online supporting information).
Survival and AML

Similar proportions of patients died on both arms within
the 58-week study period, including 18% of patients in
the romiplostim and 20.5% of patients in the placebo
group (overall survival: HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.48-1.56)
(Fig. 3B). There was no significant difference in disease
progression to AML between treatment groups. Studydefined criteria for progression to AML were met during
the 58-week period by 10 (6%) romiplostim-treated
patients and by 4 (4.9%) placebo-treated patients (HR,
1.20; 95% CI, 0.38-3.84) (Table 3; Supporting Table 1
[see online supporting information]). At the time of the
interim data cut upon which the DMC based its recommendation to discontinue study drug, AML was reported
in 10 patients who had received romiplostim (6%) and in
2 patients who had received placebo (2.4%; HR, 2.51;
95% CI, 0.55-11.47). AML-free survival rates for the
final data were 19.8% (33 patients) for the romiplostim

group and 22.9% (19 patients) for the placebo group
(HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.49-1.51). Of 14 patients who had
AML, 9 were patients whose baseline WHO classification
was RAEB-1=RAEB-2, and 5 fulfilled criteria for AML by
investigator choice to initiate chemotherapy for AML.
Patients with RAEB-1=RAEB-2 (14% of the study population) were more likely to progress to AML and comprised 64% of AML cases. MDS disease-modifying
therapies were received by 3 patients in the romiplostim
group (1.8%) and by 4 patients in the placebo group
(4.8%).
Safety

During the 58-week study period, adverse events were
reported for 157 patients (93.5%) who were receiving
romiplostim and 76 patients (92.7%) who were receiving
placebo. Similar incidences were reported during the 26week treatment period. Overall, 67 patients (39.9%) who
were receiving romiplostim and 22 patients (26.8%) who
were receiving placebo had serious adverse events (95%
CI, 32.4%-47.7% and 17.6%-37.8%, respectively). Serious adverse events that were considered related to romiplostim were reported for 12 patients (7.1%), including
increased myeloblast count, colon cancer, deep vein
thrombosis, extramedullary hemopoiesis, leukocytosis,
myelofibrosis, pneumonia, pyrexia, splenic infarction,
transient ischemic attack, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The most frequently reported adverse events in both study
arms were epistaxis, hematoma, and petechiae (Supporting Table 2; see online supporting information). One
romiplostim-treated patient who had disease progression
had serious grade 3 bone marrow fibrosis reported on day
35 of romiplostim treatment that had a reasonable possibility of being related to romiplostim. A second patient
who had a history of myelofibrosis and had disease progression had grade 2 bone marrow fibrosis noted on day
71 and grade 3 bone marrow fibrosis noted on day 99 of
treatment, although neither event was considered related
to treatment. No patients were positive for neutralizing
antibodies to romiplostim or thrombopoietin.

>10% occurred in 25 (14.9%) romiplostim-treated
patients and 3 (3.7%) placebo-treated patients (95%
CI, 9.9%-21.2% and 0.8%-10.3%, respectively).
Twenty-four of those patients (85.7%) also had immature white blood cell forms in the peripheral blood. In
14 of 16 romiplostim-treated patients with available
follow-up data, blasts decreased after romiplostim discontinuation. The remaining 2 romiplostim-treated
patients had persistent blast cell count elevations. Of
note, 11 of 14 patients (78.6%) who met the studydefined criteria for AML had an increase in immature
white blood cell forms at any time postbaseline, compared with 39% of those who did not develop AML.

DISCUSSION
This study of thrombocytopenic patients with lowrisk=intermediate-1–risk MDS demonstrated that romiplostim monotherapy increased platelet counts, decreased
platelet transfusions, and decreased overall bleeding. The
treatment groups did not differ with respect to the pri1844

mary endpoint: CSBE. There was no demonstrated effect
on survival. The overall incidences of adverse events were
similar, although there were more serious adverse events
with romiplostim (nonsignificant). Because the DMC
recommended early discontinuation of the study drug
based on interim data, thereby decreasing the study’s statistical power, additional study conclusions are limited.
However, platelet count increases and the incidence of
platelet response were greater in romiplostim-treated
patients. Romiplostim decreased overall bleeding events
(P 5 .026) and CSBEs in patients who had baseline platelet counts 20 3 109=L (P < .0001).
The CSBE endpoint is confounded by the significantly greater rate of platelet transfusions received in the
placebo group. In patients with baseline platelet counts
<20 3 109=L, no difference in CSBEs between treatment
groups was observed. However, the percentage of patients
with PTEs was significantly lower in the romiplostim
group overall (P < .001), particularly among patients
with baseline platelet counts <20 3 109=L. It is likely
that PTEs in patients with baseline platelet counts
<20 3 109=L reduced bleeding events, which may
account for the overall lack of difference in CSBEs
between the placebo and romiplostim groups.
A composite endpoint of bleeding and platelet transfusions, similar to that comprising both bleeding and rescue medication use developed for patients with immune
thrombocytopenia,23,24 might aid in the evaluation of
romiplostim in MDS. Additional trials evaluating additional patient populations with endpoints that account
for platelet transfusions and bleeding may be worthwhile.
Although the study drug was discontinued because

with romiplostim, the rates of overall survival and progression to AML-free survival were similar between study
arms. However, the study was not designed or powered to
evaluate AML risk and was truncated early. Two
romiplostim-treated patients who had increases in peripheral blast cell counts initiated treatment for AML without
undergoing bone marrow biopsies 4 weeks after discontinuing romiplostim. Such patients were counted as having
progressed to AML, which could affect interpretation of
the results. In both arms of the study, patients with
RAEB-1=RAEB-2 were disproportionately represented
among those who developed AML. Romiplostim may
stimulate megakaryocytes and other hematopoietic
cells,25-27 which may account for the increases in blast cell
counts observed more frequently with romiplostim and
which often decreased after romiplostim discontinuation.
Additional analysis revealed that, in most of these patients,
romiplostim induced an increase in immature white blood
cell forms and peripheral blood blasts, which could have
led to an incorrect diagnosis of and treatment for AML.
One limitation of this study is the early discontinuation of study drug, which led to a smaller data set. This
reduced power may have contributed to not meeting the
primary endpoint: CSBE. Second, CSBE may have been
confounded by platelet transfusions for which there were
no set guidelines. Third, standard-of-care MDS treatments were allowed in the extended treatment period and
during LTFU. The study was not designed to analyze the
impact of those therapies, so their effects on outcomes
were not evaluated. Finally, the broad criteria for diagnosing AML, some of which did not require bone marrow
evaluation, along with data on transient blast increases,
may account in part for the relatively high rate of AML
observed in this low-risk population.28 Because this represented a homogeneous population of relatively healthy
patients with lower risk MDS, generalization is limited.
Although the data set was affected by the early discontinuation of study drug, the available data indicate
that romiplostim monotherapy increased platelet counts
and decreased platelet transfusions and all bleeding except
CSBEs in thrombocytopenic patients with lowrisk=intermediate-1–risk MDS. The rates of AML and
survival were similar between study arms. Additional data
will be evaluated as LTFU continues, including the effects
of romiplostim on the risk of disease progression to AML.
