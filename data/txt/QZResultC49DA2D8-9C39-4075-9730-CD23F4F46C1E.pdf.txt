Abstract
The results of a phase I clinical trial of the topoisomerase I
(Topo I) poison CPT-11 followed by the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor flavopiridol in patients with advanced solid
tumors indicate that patients whose tumors were wild-type,
but not mutant, for p53 obtained the most clinical benefit
from this combination therapy. We elected to elucidate the
mechanistic basis for this effect in isogenic-paired HCT116
colon cancer cells that were either wild-type (+/+) or null
(/) for p53. With the combination therapy of SN-38 (the
active metabolite of CPT-11) followed by flavopiridol, the
induction of apoptosis was 5-fold greater in the p53+/+ cells
compared with the p53/ cells. This sequential treatment
induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15, which interacted
with Rad51, a DNA repair protein involved in homologous
recombination. Rad51 bound to p53-Ser15 within the first
5 hours of combination therapy, and then was transcriptionally suppressed at 24 hours by flavopiridol only in p53+/+ cells.
Microarray analysis also revealed suppression of Rad51 in a
p53-dependent manner. Depletion of Rad51 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitized both p53+/+ and p53/ cells to
SN-38–induced apoptosis with increase of ;H2AX, a marker of
DNA damage. Conversely, overexpression of Rad51 rescued
p53+/+ cells from SN!F–induced apoptosis. Because flavopiridol inhibits Cdk9, we found that inhibition of Cdk9 by DRB
or by siRNA could recapitulate the flavopiridol effects, with
suppression of Rad51 and induction of apoptosis only in
p53+/+ cells. In conclusion, after DNA damage by Topo I
poisons, flavopiridol targets homologous recombination
through a p53-dependent down-regulation of Rad51, resulting
in enhancement of apoptosis. [Cancer Res 2008;68(7):2312–20]

Introduction
SN-38 (the active metabolite of CPT-11) stabilizes the topoisomerase I (Topo I)–DNA complex, and its collision with the DNA
replication fork leads to the generation of permanent strand breaks
and G2 arrest. Flavopiridol, a pan–cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor, has been reported to induce DNA damage (1) and inhibit
tumor cell growth through cell cycle arrest at G1 or G2 (2). We have
previously reported that flavopiridol at noncytotoxic, nanomolar
concentrations significantly enhances the induction of apoptosis by
the chemotherapeutic agent mitomycin C and paclitaxel in gastric

and breast cancer cell lines (3, 4). Also, the addition of flavopiridol
to HCT116 cells enhanced the induction of apoptosis by SN-38 and
increased the efficacy of CPT-11 in HCT116-treated xenografts (5).
These events were highly sequence dependent such that SN-38 or
CPT-11 needed to be administered before flavopiridol both in vitro
and in vivo to induce this effect.
Based on this preclinical data, a phase I clinical trial of CPT-11
followed by flavopiridol was initiated. This study indicated that
patients whose tumors were wild-type, but not mutant, for p53
obtained the most clinical benefit from this combination therapy
(6). In view of this, we elected to determine the role of p53 in the
enhancement of SN-38–induced apoptosis by flavopiridol. After
DNA damage, the level of p53 increases and induces a range of
responses, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, and
DNA repair. This depends on the type and dose of the genotoxic
stress. Recent studies have shown that p53 represents a central
player in DNA repair by repressing homologous recombination,
counteracting error-prone double-strand breaks, and promoting
genomic stability (7). Activation of p53 is also mediated by
posttranslational modifications by specific kinases, such as the
ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and the ATM and Rad3
related (8, 9). When DNA replication is blocked, p53 becomes
phosphorylated at Ser15 and associates with key enzymes of
homologous recombination, such as the MRN complex, Rad51 and
Rad54 (10, 11). Rad51 is central to homologous recombination–
mediated double-strand break repair, by forming nucleoprotein
filaments and mediating strand exchange between DNA duplexes
(12, 13). Aberrant amounts of Rad51 have been observed in a
number of transformed cell types (14) and may induce malignant
transformation. Biochemical investigations showed that p53
inhibits Rad51-mediated strand exchange in vitro (11, 15, 16).
Furthermore, p53 modulates homologous recombination by the
transcriptional repression of the RAD51 gene (17). Therefore, we
elected to determine whether the enhancement of SN-38–induced
apoptosis was p53 dependent and the role of Rad51 in this process.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells and its p53-null
variant were a gift from Dr. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,
MA). Cells were grown in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. SN-38 (5 mmol/L stock, Pharmacia) was prepared in DMSO.
Flavopiridol (4.5 mmol/L) was prepared in water. z-VAD was purchased
from MBL International. Cycloheximide and Lnll were from Sigma Aldrich.
Apoptosis assays. The measurement of apoptosis by quantitative
fluorescence microscopy (QFM) with 4¶,6¶-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma
Chemical Co.) for nuclear chromatin was performed as previously described
(3). Apoptosis was also measured using Annexin V–FITC Apoptosis
detection Kit II (BD PharMingen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The statistical significance of the experimental results was determined by
the two-sided t test.

Flavopiridol Inhibits DNA Repair by Suppressing Rad51

Figure 1. Flavopiridol induces apoptosis
in SN-38–treated HCTp53+/+ cells. Cells
were treated with SN-38 (20 nmol/L)
followed by drug-free medium (ND ) or
flavopiridol (300 nmol/L). Apoptosis was
scored by QFM analysis (A) or staining
with Annexin V (B).

Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor (Complete Mini, Roche
Diagnostics) and 1 mmol/L NaVO3. Equal amounts of protein were loaded
on 4% to 12% PAGE gels (Invitrogen). The membranes were probed with
antibodies for p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), Rad51 (Calbiochem),
p53-Ser15 (Cell Signaling), and a-tubulin (Upstate Biotechnology). Equivalent amounts of proteins from the cleared lysates were incubated with
Rad51 antibody for 3 h at 4jC. Then, 30 AL of agarose beads (Upstate
Biotechnology) were added for an additional hour. Immunocomplexes were
washed in lysis buffer and suspended in 4 SDS sample buffer for Western
blot analysis.
Quantitative real-time PCR. RNA was extracted with TriPure Isolation
Reagent (Roche Diagnostic). Reverse transcription of 1 Ag of RNA was done
using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. All quantitative real-time reverse
transcription PCR assays were done on the 7300 Real Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems),
which include gene-specific probe and primer sets, were used to detect both
Rad51 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA.
The relative expression of Rad51 was calculated by normalizing to GAPDH
mRNA. Graphs are the means of three separate experiments.

Microarray data analysis. cDNA was synthesized in the presence of
oligo(dT)24-T7 from Genset Corp. cRNA was prepared using biotinylated
UTP and CTP and was hybridized to HG U113A oligonucleotide arrays
(Affymetrix, Inc). Data preprocessing and statistical analysis were carried
out in R3 and Bioconductor.4 The expression intensities were normalized
using the Robust Multiarray Average method (18), which includes (a)
background adjustment, (b) quantile normalization across arrays, and (c)
probe-level expression measure summarization using median polish on
the log 2 scale for each probe set. Differential expression analysis was
performed to identify genes that were differentially expressed between SN
alone–treated versus SN!F–treated samples in the parental cell line and
in the p53-deficient cell line, respectively. An empirical Bayes t test was
applied to each gene (19). This test is a modified version of the
conventional t test and is more suitable for data with small sample size.
A P value cutoff of 0.001 was used to select differentially expressed genes
(P V 0.001), whereas a P value cutoff of 0.50 was used to select

nondifferentially expressed genes (P z 0.50). Unsupervised hierarchical
clustering was done to look for samples and genes with similar gene
expression patterns. The samples were clustered using the Euclidean
distance as the dissimilarity measure and the Ward function as the
joining method; the genes were clustered using the Euclidean distance
and the Complete function. The results of the cluster analysis were
displayed a heat map.
Plasmid and small interfering RNA transfections. Rad51 full-length
cDNA was cloned from HCT116 cells using the Titan One Step reverse
transcription-PCR Kit (Roche Applied Science) and inserted in the
mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The Rad51/P186
mutant (11) was generated using the QuikChange II Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Cdk9 (SMART-Pool) and Rad51 small
interfering RNA (siRNA) were obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. The sequence
for Rad51 siRNA was GAGCUUGACAAACUACUUC. siRNAs were transfected using OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen).

Results
Flavopiridol enhances SN-38–induced apoptosis in a p53dependent manner. Human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells with
wild-type p53 (p53+/+) and its p53 null isogenic sub–cell line
(p53/) were treated with 20 nmol/L SN-38 and 300 nmol/L
flavopiridol individually and sequentially, as SN-38 for 24 hours
(SN24) followed by either flavopiridol (SN24!F24) or drug-free
medium for 24 hours (SN24!ND24). It has been shown that under
these treatment conditions, SN-38 induces DNA damage and a
potent G2 cell cycle arrest in both cell lines at 24 hours, with p53
and p21 up-regulation in the p53+/+ cells (5) and activation of
chk1 kinase in the p53/ cells (20). As determined by QFM
(Fig. 1A), SN-38 or flavopiridol alone did not induce significant
apoptosis. The sequential treatment of p53+/+ cells with
SN24!F24 induced apoptosis in 23.5 F 2.1% of the cells, which
was significantly greater than that observed for SN24!ND24
(3.8 F 1.2%). However, the SN24!F24 treatment induced 4.7 F
1.1% apoptosis in p53/ cells. This was further evaluated with
Annexin V+ staining (Fig. 1B). With this method, 18% to 20% of

both p53+/+ and p53/ cells became positive for Annexin V
after SN-38 treatment. With the addition of flavopiridol, Annexin
V+ increased to 37.6% in the p53+/+ cells (P < 0.001 versus SN-38
alone–treated cells), whereas there was no significant change in
the p53/ cells. Thus, the enhancement of SN-38–induced
apoptosis in G2-arrested cells by flavopiridol seems to be p53
dependent.
In view of this, we investigated the effects of SN-38 and
flavopiridol on p53 induction in the p53+/+ cells. As shown in
Fig. 2A, both conditions up-regulated p53 protein levels over
time. In contrast, with SN-38 for 24 hours followed by drug-free
medium for up to 24 hours (SN24!ND24), there was a timedependent decrease in p53 expression. However, the sequential
treatment of SN-38 for 24 hours followed by flavopiridol for 3 to
24 hours (SN24!Fx ) induced a time-dependent increase in total
p53, as well as the induction of phosphorylated p53 at Ser15.
Under these conditions, Rad51 was induced by SN-38 at 24 hours,
which was sustained when the cells were then changed to drugfree medium. In contrast, Rad51 was down-regulated by flavopiridol, both as a single agent and in sequential treatment with
SN-38 (SN24!Fx ).
Phosphorylated p53 at Ser15 has been found to interact with
Rad51 and inhibit its activity during DNA repair (10). Interestingly,
coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2B, right) showed that
p53 bound to Rad51 after 5 hours of the sequential SN!F5
treatment, but not with SN-38 alone for 24 hours (SN!F0). This
interaction was sustained for the next 16 hours, until Rad51 was
down-regulated at 24 hours by flavopiridol (Fig. 2B).
Flavopiridol down-regulates Rad51 in a p53-dependent
manner. Thus, it would seem that with this sequential therapy
at early time points, Rad51 binds to p53-Ser15; however Rad51
expression is suppressed over time. Rad51 is an important
regulator of homologous recombination and is reportedly
inhibited by p53, not only through physical interaction but also
by transcriptional repression (17). Thus, we tested whether

Flavopiridol Inhibits DNA Repair by Suppressing Rad51

Figure 3. Flavopiridol induces down-regulation of Rad51 in a p53-dependent manner. A, HCTp53+/+ and p53/ cells were treated with SN-38 for 24 h, then released
in drug-free medium or flavopiridol for the indicated times. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for Rad51 and gH2AX expression. B, a series of cell lines
with wild-type or mutant p53 was treated with SN!ND () and SN!F (+) for 24 h and analyzed for Rad51 expression. Tubulin is shown to confirm equal protein
loading. C, identical conditions were used to evaluate these same cell lines for apoptosis by QFM. D, cells were treated SN!F in the presence of 10 Amol/L zVAD or

flavopiridol could differentially regulate Rad51 depending on the
p53 status of the cells. HCTp53+/+ and p53/ cells were treated
with SN-38 for 24 hours followed by flavopiridol for the indicated
times. Rad51 declined in p53+/+ cells, with almost complete
down-regulation after 20 hours of flavopiridol treatment (Fig. 3A).
In contrast, Rad51 continued to be expressed over time in
p53/ cells. In addition, g-H2AX showed a time-dependent
increase only in the p53+/+ cells, consistent with an increase in
double-strand DNA breaks.
To extend these findings for the p53 dependency of Rad51
suppression, we tested the effect of SN-38 and flavopiridol on a
panel of cell lines that differ in their p53 status. As shown in
Fig. 3B, the suppression of Rad51 with the sequential therapy of
SN!F was observed only in cell lines that are wild-type for p53,
including gastric cancer (MKN-74) and melanomas (M173 and
M19). Still, no suppression of Rad51 was observed in three colon
cancer cell lines (H747, HT29, and SW620) that are mutant for

p53. This is in contrast to the HCTp53/ cells, which exhibited
a decrease in Rad51 expression at later time points, suggesting
slight differences in cell-specific responses to flavopiridol among
p53 mutant cell lines. The suppression of Rad51 expression in
the p53 wild-type cell lines again correlated with the enhancement of SN-38–induced apoptosis by QFM (Fig. 3C). In contrast,
there was no increase in apoptosis with SN!F in the p53
mutant cell lines. In control experiments, to exclude proteasomeand caspase-mediated effects on Rad51 down-regulation, we
used the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD or the proteasome
inhibitor Lnll together with the SN!F treatments. Under these
conditions, the time-dependent suppression of Rad51 by SN!F
in the p53+/+ cells could not be restored by the addition of
either compounds (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, Rad51 protein stability
was assessed in both cell lines by adding cycloheximide to the
SN!F treatments, and we found no difference in protein decay
by 6 hours (Fig. 3E).

Next, we compared Rad51 mRNA levels by real-time PCR in both
cell lines. The addition of flavopiridol to the SN-38–treated cells
induced significant reductions in Rad51 mRNA in the p53+/+
cells over time (Fig. 4A). In contrast, Rad51 mRNA levels did not
decrease significantly with flavopiridol in the p53/ cells. To
further investigate the effect of flavopiridol on the expression of
p53-dependent genes, we performed microarray analysis, using
Affymetrix U133A GeneChip arrays, to identify genes that were
differentially expressed between SN-38 alone versus SN!F–treated
samples in the p53+/+ cells, but not in the p53/ cell line. There
are 116 genes that are down-regulated by flavopiridol in the
HCTp53+/+ cell line but unaffected in the HCTp53/ cells,
which we will call ‘‘differentially suppressed genes’’ (Supplementary
Data). Among the 116 genes, an unsupervised hierarchical
clustering was performed to look for samples and genes with
similar expression patterns (Fig. 4B). Some of these differentially
expressed genes encode proteins critical for cell cycle (Cdk2, cyclin
D3, p19), regulation of transcription (GTF2A1, NR3C1, POLR2L,
MED12, ZNF337, DNAJC1), and regulation of apoptosis (FAIM3). We
also found significant suppression of two genes involved in DNA
repair, one of them being Rad51. The other is HMGB1, a member of
the large family of HMG-box proteins, which has been associated
with mammalian excision base repair in the setting of oxidative
stress (21). Taken together, these results suggest that Rad51 is
down-regulated by flavopiridol in a p53-dependent manner.
Furthermore, a survey of genes indicates that Rad51 is the only
gene suppressed in a p53-dependent manner that has been directly
linked to the process of homologous recombination.
The suppression of Rad51 is, in part, mediated by inhibition
of Cdk9. Flavopiridol is a potent inhibitor of Cdk9, which phosphorylates the COOH-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and
promotes initiation and elongation of mRNA transcripts (22).

www.aacrjournals.org

To address the possibility that Cdk9 inhibition by flavopiridol may
directly suppress the expression of Rad51, we used a specific Cdk9
inhibitor, DRB, and a specific Cdk9 siRNA in HCTp53+/+ and
HCTp53/ cells. Both DRB (Fig. 5A) and Cdk9 depletion by
siRNA (Fig. 5C) mimicked flavopiridol effects in SN-38–treated
p53+/+ cells, with down-regulation of Rad51, induction of p53, and
increase in apoptosis (Fig. 5A–D). In p53/ cells, however, Rad51
did not change after Cdk9 down-regulation by siRNA (Fig. 5C),
slightly decreased only at later time points with SN!DRB
treatment (Fig. 5A), and demonstrated no significant increase in
apoptosis (Fig. 5B and D). These results suggest that downregulation of Rad51 by flavopiridol is, at least in part, due to the
inhibition of Cdk9, and that the induction of apoptosis under
these treatment conditions still requires the presence of p53.
Depletion of Rad51 sensitizes HCT116 cells to single-agent
SN-38. Next, we tested whether the depletion of Rad51 would
recapitulate the effect of flavopiridol, in the presence or absence
of p53. Both cell lines were transfected with a specific Rad51 or
control siRNA and then treated with SN-38. As shown in Fig. 6A,
Rad51 was completely down-regulated in both p53+/+ and
p53/ cell lines after siRNA transfection. There was evidence
of induction of gH2AX (Fig. 6A) and low levels of spontaneous
apoptosis in both cell lines (Fig. 6B) when compared with siRNA
controls. Treatment with SN-38 for 24 hours (SN24) induced
23.7 F 1.7% apoptosis in p53+/+ cells and 19.2 F 0.3% in p53/
cells (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that Rad51 plays a role in the
protection from apoptosis to single-agent SN-38 treatment in
both cell lines.
Overexpression of Rad51 results in resistance to SN!F
according to p53 status. The role of Rad51 in SN!F–induced
apoptosis was further investigated by generating Rad51-overexpressing cells. In these experiments, we also used the mutant

Rad51/186P (11), which lacks the ability to bind p53. The
constructs were transfected in p53+/+ cells 24 hours before
SN!F treatment. Rad51 protein levels are shown in Fig. 6C.
Overexpression of Rad51 and Rad51/P186 decreased the percentage induction of apoptosis by SN!F from 21 F 1% of vector
transfectants to 11 F 1% and 8 F 1%, respectively (Fig. 6D).
This also corresponded to a decrease in gH2AX expression,
demonstrating that with SN!F, Rad51 overexpression decreased
DNA damage, especially when it could not bind to p53. Taken
together, these results indicate that Rad51 plays a central role in
the resistance to SN-38 and that flavopiridol induces a p53dependent suppression of Rad51 that results in induction of
apoptosis.

Discussion
Homologous recombination mediates the error-free repair of
DNA, mostly during the late S-G2 phases of the cell cycle (23, 24). In
the presence of high doses of DNA-damaging agents or defects in
the DNA repair machinery, the repair is unsuccessful and this may
lead to permanent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Our studies
indicate that flavopiridol converted Topo I–induced cell cycle
arrest into apoptosis through a p53-dependent transcriptional
suppression of Rad51. This seems to involve two steps. First, with
sequential SN!F treatment, there is early binding of p53-Ser15 to
Rad51, which seems to be sufficient to inhibit the process of Rad51mediated DNA repair that occurs after SN-38–induced DNA
damage. In fact, mutation of Rad51 at its binding domain to p53
significantly prevented the induction of apoptosis with the
sequential therapy. This is then followed by a second event of
down-regulation of Rad51 at the mRNA level.
Our studies indicate that this effect is not due to caspase- or
proteasome-mediated degradation of Rad51 or due to differences

in protein stability. This transcriptional suppression of Rad51
with sequential SN!F and the resulting induction of apoptosis
are absolutely dependent on the presence of wild-type p53. This
p53-dependent effect on Rad51 suppression was further confirmed using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene
expression profiles. Among 116 genes suppressed by flavopiridol
on SN-38–treated HCTp53+/+ cells, only two genes involved in
DNA repair were identified, and one of them was Rad51.
Although these results do not exclude the effect of the transcriptional suppression of these other genes in this combination
therapy, it indicates that when flavopiridol is combined with a
topoisomerase poison the suppression of Rad51 does play a
significant role in the enhancement chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis.
Flavopiridol has been implicated in the transcriptional
repression of numerous genes (25), including the antiapoptotic
genes Mcl-1 (26), the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein
(XIAP), and c-Kit (27). This effect is mediated by inhibition of the
Cdk9/pTEFb complex, which regulates RNA polymerase II (21).
These effects have not being reported as p53 dependent. In fact,
our microarray analysis of genes suppressed in a p53-dependent
manner with SN!F did not indicate differential suppression of
Mcl-1 or any of the Bcl-2 family members. Using siRNA against
Cdk9 and DRB to target Cdk9 with SN-38, we show suppression
of Rad51 in the p53+/+ cells. This would suggest that suppression
of Rad51 by Cdk9 inhibition is a p53-dependent process and that
flavopiridol represents a novel therapeutic approach in the
targeting of this gene.
In the p53+/+ cells, both SN-38 and flavopiridol are shown to
up-regulate p53. However, it is only after SN!F treatment that we
observe sustained p53 phosphorylation. It has been shown that p53
can reduce the activity of a variety of promoters (28), including
those of c-fos (29) and Rb (30). Posttranslational modifications of

Flavopiridol Inhibits DNA Repair by Suppressing Rad51

p53, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, are involved in the
modulation of p53 transcriptional activities (31, 32). This increases
the possibility that p53 in its phosphorylated state may be playing a
role in the transcriptional suppression of Rad51 under these
treatment conditions.
Recently, inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases has been
implicated in the reduction of DNA repair mechanisms. For
example, the pan–cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine
sensitized tumor cell lines to doxorubicin by increasing the amount
of double-strand DNA breaks and reducing the efficiency of
homologous recombination repair (33). This effect seemed to be
predominant in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle, where
homologous recombination was preferentially active. Although
DNA-PK activity was suppressed by roscovitine, the effect of
roscovitine on Rad51 was not explored.
Rad51 activity is essential during homologous recombination–
mediated double-strand break repair, either during replication
(34) or following exposure to DNA-damaging agents. Its central
role in homologous recombination is supported by studies with
Rad51 knockout mice, which showed early embryonic lethality
(35). Furthermore, it has been reported that down-regulation of
Rad51 enhanced the anticancer activities of cisplatin (36) and
increased the radiosensitivity of tumor cells (37). Conversely, a
number of studies showed that high levels of Rad51 caused
resistance to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin (38) and 5-fluorouracil (39). We also found that overexpression of Rad51 significantly protected p53+/+ cells from
SN!F–induced apoptosis.

For flavopiridol, the targeting of Rad51 seems to be critical for the
increase in DNA damage and the enhancement of SN-38–induced
apoptosis. This observation and a mechanistic understanding of this
process should have significant implications for the development of
this agent in solid tumors. Currently, flavopiridol has been shown to
have single activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is
believed to be mediated by the flavopiridol targeting of Cdk9 and the
suppression of Mcl-1 and bcl-2 family members (40). However, the
experience with single-agent flavopiridol in the treatment of solid
tumors has been generally disappointing (41, 42). In contrast, clinical
activity of flavopiridol in combination with chemotherapy has been
observed (6, 43, 44). The ultimate success of this agent will depend
on the identification of subpopulation of patients who will most
benefit from the combination with chemotherapy. A clinical trial to
test this hypothesis with sequential CPT-11 and flavopiridol in
patients with gastroesophageal cancer who are wild-type p53 is now
being planned, and suppression of Rad51 in serial tumor biopsies
will be examined. Therefore, based on these laboratory studies, it is
our hope that the targeting of Rad51 with Topo I inhibitors followed
by flavopiridol will represent a new approach for the treatment of
solid tumors that are wild-type p53.
