BACKGROUND: The outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer treated on early phase clinical trials have not been
systematically analyzed. The purpose of this study was to report the presenting characteristics and outcomes of
patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer treated on phase 1 clinical trials at a single institution.
METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of consecutive patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who were
treated in the Phase I Clinical Trials Program at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from November
2004 to March 2009. Data recorded and analyzed included survival, response, and disease characteristics. RESULTS:
Eighty-three patients were identified. The median age was 62 years (range, 39-81 years). Of 78 patients evaluable for
response, 2 (3%) had a partial response (PR), and 10 (13%) had stable disease (SD) for 4 months. With a median follow-up for survivors of 3.7 months, the median survival from presentation in the phase 1 clinic was 5.0 months (95%
confidence interval [CI], 3.3-6.2). The median overall survival from diagnosis was 22.1 months (95% CI, 17.9-26.5). The
median time to treatment failure was 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.3-1.8). Independent factors associated with lower rates of
PR/SD were liver metastases (P ¼ .001) and performance status >0 (P ¼ .01). Independent factors associated with
shorter survival were liver metastases (P ¼ .007), low calcium level (P ¼ .015), and elevated CEA level (>6 ng/mL) (P
¼ .005). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that phase 1 clinical trials offer a reasonable therapeutic approach for

KEYWORDS: phase 1, pancreatic cancer, survival, response.

Pancreatic cancer is the ninth and 10th most common cancer type in women and men, respectively, but it is the
fourth leading cause of cancer death, with uniformly poor long-term survival.1 It is estimated that approximately 42,500
patients were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2009 and 35,250 died2 in the United States. The median survival is 5 to
7 months,3 and the 5-year survival rate is <5%.4,5 Surgical resection provides the only potential for cure, but because of
the disease’s typically late presentation, only 20% of patients are eligible for pancreatectomy.
The only medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pancreatic
cancer are gemcitabine and erlotinib. Gemcitabine was shown to reduce pain, improve performance status, and help
patients maintain weight,6,7 but the objective tumor response rate was low (5.4%-10.5%).6,7 The addition of erlotinib, an
epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, modestly prolonged survival.8 In a randomized trial, the 1-year survival rates
in the gemcitabine plus erlotinib and gemcitabine alone groups were 23% and 17%, respectively (P ¼ .023).8 Gemcitabine has been combined with other cytotoxins, such as 5-fluorouracil,9 cisplatin,10,11 docetaxel,12-15 oxaliplatin,16,17 capecitabine,18 irinotecan,19 or 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin and epirubicin.20 Meta-analyses demonstrated a survival benefit
with the gemcitabine-based combinations, and in a subset analysis, gemcitabine combinations with platinum compounds
and capecitabine were superior to gemcitabine and irinotecan or 5-fluorouracil combinations.21,22

Original Article

Patients with pancreatic cancer are sometimes
referred for investigational treatment, including phase 1
clinical trials. However, the outcomes of these patients
have not been systematically analyzed. Here we report the
presenting characteristics and outcomes of patients with
locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who were
referred to the phase 1 clinic at The University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed the medical records of consecutive patients
with pancreatic cancer who were treated in the Phase I Clinical Trials Program at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from
November 2004 to March 2009, and we assessed their associated characteristics and clinical outcomes. Data were collected from transcribed notes in the electronic database.
Patient records were reviewed from the time of presentation
in the Phase I Clinical Trials Program.
Patients eligible for phase 1 clinical trial participation
were 18 years old and had metastatic or unresectable pancreatic cancer for which approved curative therapies were no
longer effective. Patients had progressive disease, evidence
of measurable disease according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),23 performance status
0 to 2, and a life expectancy >3 months. Premenopausal
women were required to have a negative pregnancy test and
patients of childbearing potential to use contraception. Further eligibility criteria varied according to the particular
study. All patients provided written informed consent
before enrollment onto a trial. All trials were approved by
the M. D. Anderson institutional review board, which also
granted a waiver of informed consent and a waiver of authorization for this retrospective study.
Phase 1 treatment was determined after clinical, laboratory, and pathologic data were reviewed. The allocation of patients to investigational treatments varied over
time according to protocol availability at the time the
patients were seen. After initiation of an investigational
therapy, patients were evaluated at 3- to 4-week intervals.
At each visit, a history review and physical examination
were performed, and a comprehensive series of metabolic
and hematologic tests was conducted. Patients were
assessed for the onset of new symptoms and medicine
compliance related to the study drug.
Endpoints and Statistical Methods
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the patients’
characteristics. The chi-square test was used to examine

78

the association between 2 categorical variables. The following covariates were analyzed: age; sex; history of smoking; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status (PS); tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen
[CEA], carbohydrate antigens [CAs] CA 19-9, CA 125,
CA 27.29); history of pancreatectomy; number of prior
therapies; local recurrence; metastases in the liver, lung,
lymph nodes, peritoneum, or omentum; number of metastatic sites; leukocyte count; hemoglobin level; platelet
count; and albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and
serum creatinine levels.
Best response was assessed by an M. D. Anderson
radiologist every 2 cycles of therapy (cycle ¼ 3-4 weeks,
depending on the protocol), using RECIST guidelines.23
Partial response (PR) was defined as a 30% decrease in
the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, excluding
complete disappearance of disease. Progressive disease (PD)
was defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined as
small changes that did not meet the criteria for a PR or PD.
Waterfall plot analysis was used to illustrate response, if any,
as previously described.24 Responses shown in the waterfall
plot were also grouped according to RECIST guidelines.23
Survival was measured from the date of presentation
to the Phase I Clinical Trials Program until death from
any cause or last follow-up. Time to treatment failure
(TTF) was measured from the first day of treatment on a
clinical trial in our Phase I Clinical Trials Program to the
date the patient went off study because of toxicity, disease
progression, or death. For patients treated with >1 therapy, data of TTF from the first therapy was used. Toxicities were assessed using the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.25 A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS
9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and S-Plus, version 7.0
(Insightful Corp., Seattle, Wash) software.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Overall, 83 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were
treated on phase 1 trials during the study period. The median age was 62 years (range, 39-81 years). There were 40
men and 43 women. The most common metastatic sites
were liver (54% of patients), lung (51%), lymph nodes
(37%), and peritoneum and omentum (24%) (Table 1).

The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 0-7).
Thirty-two (39%) patients had a history of pancreatectomy.
Sixty-seven (81%) patients had 1 or more comorbidity. The most common comorbidities were cardiovascular (hypertension and/or coronary artery disease, n ¼
35 [42%]), endocrinologic (diabetes mellitus, n ¼ 19
[23%]; hypothyroidism n ¼ 10 (12%), and gastrointestinal (gastroesophageal reflux disease, diverticulitis/diverticulosis, or ulcerative colitis, n ¼ 18 [22%]). Six (7%)
patients had a history of prior cancer (breast, n ¼ 3; prostate, n ¼ 1; squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, n

patients had 2 prior malignancies: 1 with prostate cancer
and follicular lymphoma and the other with prostate cancer and colorectal carcinoma. All prior malignancies were
in remission at the time of diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
Treatment
Sixty (72%) of 83 patients were treated with a single agent

cytotoxic agent. Of 23 patients treated with combination
therapy, 9 were treated with targeted agent combination
therapy, 2 with cytotoxic agent combination therapy, 8
with cytotoxic and targeted agents, and 4 with targeted
and cytokine combination therapies (Table 2).
After treatment failure in the first phase 1 clinical
trial, 25 patients received further treatment. Sixteen
patients enrolled in another phase 1 clinical trial, 8
received single-agent or cytotoxic and targeted combination therapies, and 1 patient underwent surgical excision
of a retroperitoneal metastatic lesion.
Response
Of 83 patients, 78 were evaluable for response. Overall,
62 reached the time of response assessment (after 2 cycles
of therapy), and 16 patients had clinical evidence of
disease progression, including 3 patients who died while
on the investigational therapy (waterfall plot, 20%
response). Five patients were not evaluable for response (2
died from pulmonary embolism, 2 withdrew consent, and
1 was lost to follow-up).
Of 78 patients, the maximum response was PR in 2
(3%) patients and SD in 30 (39%) patients (Fig. 1). Overall, 10 (13%) patients had SD for 4 months.
Factors predicting higher rates of PR and SD were PS
of 0 (P ¼ .02), absence of liver metastases (P ¼ .001), and
normal CA 27-29 values (38 U/mL, P ¼ .03) (Table 1).

median overall survival from the date of presentation to

1-year survival rate was 15.8% (95% CI, 9%-28%). Overall, 63 patients died (37 [80%] of 46 with PD, 22 [69%]
of 32 with PR or SD; 2 patients died of pulmonary disease, and the cause of death was unknown in 2 patients).
When survival was calculated from the time of diagnosis of pancreatic cancer to death or last follow-up, the
median survival duration was 22.1 months (95% CI,

17.9-26.5 months) (Fig. 2B). Survival by response
(RECIST) is shown in Figure 2C. The median survival
durations of patients who had PR, SD, or PD were 8.9
months, 7.7 months, and 3.3 months, respectively
(P<.001). In univariate analysis, factors predicting
shorter overall survival were elevated levels of CEA (>6
ng/mL, P ¼ .02), CA 27-29 (>47 U/mL, P ¼ .02), or
CA 125 (>35 U/mL, P ¼ .02). Liver metastases (P ¼
.10), calcium 8.4 mg/dL (P ¼ .09), and bilirubin >1
mg/dL (P ¼ .08) were marginally associated with shorter
overall survival (Table 1).

TTF
The median TTF for 83 patients was 1.5 months (95%
CI, 1.3-1.8 months) (Fig. 3A). The median TTF for
patients who had PR, SD, or PD was 5.3 months, 2.2
months, and 1.3 months, respectively. Figure 3B shows
that TTF was longer in patients with PR or SD compared
with patients who had PD (P < .001).
In univariate analysis, factors associated with shorter
TTF were smoking history (P ¼ .01), liver metastases (P
¼ .03), and elevated serum levels of bilirubin (>1 mg/dL;
P ¼ .01), LDH (>618 IU/L; P ¼ .03), CEA (>6 ng/mL;
P ¼ .01), or CA 27-29 (>47 U/mL; P ¼ .01) (Table 1).
Of 83 patients, 73 had received systemic antitumor
therapy before referral to the Phase I Clinical Trials Program (10 patients underwent only pancreatectomy and/or

Phase 1 Trials in Pancreatic Cancer/Vaklavas et al

Phase I Clinical Trials Program compared with TTF on a
phase 1 treatment (median TTF, 1.5 months; 95% CI,
1.3-1.8; P ¼ .004; Fig. 3C).
Multivariate Analysis
In multivariate analysis, independent factors associated
with lower rates of PR or SD were liver metastases (P ¼
.001) and PS >0 (P ¼ .01) (Table 3). Independent factors
associated with shorter survival were liver metastases (P ¼
.007), calcium 8.4 mg/nL (P ¼ .015), and elevated serum levels of CEA (>6 ng/mL; P ¼ .005). Independent
factors associated with shorter TTF were history of smoking (P ¼ .009), liver metastases (P ¼ .001), serum
bilirubin levels >1 mg/dL (P ¼ .007), and >1 prior
therapy (P ¼ .002).

DISCUSSION
This is the first study to systematically analyze the clinical
outcomes of patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer referred to a phase 1 clinic. Our analysis demonstrates that treatment on phase 1 clinical trials is a
reasonable approach for these patients. The median TTF
was 1.5 months (range, 1.3-1.8 months). The PR rate was
3% (2 of 78 patients evaluable for response), and 13% of
patients (10 of 78) had stable disease for 4 months.
With a median follow-up of 3.7 months, the median survival from the time of presentation to the Phase I Clinical
Trials Program was 5.0 months (range, 3.3-6.2 months).
Several clinical trials are investigating the role of new
agents or FDA-approved drugs in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.26 More recently, a phase 1/2 clinical trial in
pancreatic cancer demonstrated that the combination of
albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) and gemcitabine27
induced a response rate of 26.5% (RECIST).27 Overexpression of the secreted protein acid rich in cysteine
(SPARC) in pancreatic cancer cells and surrounding
stroma was correlated with clinical outcomes.28 In addition, the molecular elucidation of the pathway of KRAS, a
protein mutated in 90% of pancreatic cancer cases, may
spawn the investigation of novel targeted agents.29
Other investigators have reported on the clinical
outcomes of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
The median survival in the current study (5 months) compares favorably to the median survival reported with best
supportive care (3 months).30 The reported median survival in patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer ranges from 8 to 12 months and from 3 to 6
months, respectively.31 Our findings are consistent with
Cancer

the recommendation by the National Cancer Institute
that patients with advanced pancreatic cancer at any stage
should be considered for clinical trials, before considering
palliative measures.31
The current study identified independent factors
predicting response, survival, and TTF by multivariate
analyses in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Liver
metastases and performance status >0 predicted lower
rates of PR or SD. Independent factors associated with
shorter time to failure were history of smoking, liver metastases, bilirubin levels >1 mg/dL, >1 prior therapy. Independent factors associated with shorter survival were
elevated CEA, liver metastases, and hypocalcemia. The
role of CA 19-9 in pancreatic cancer has been extensively
investigated.32 Although our study did not show that CA
19-9 levels had prognostic significance, it did show that
tumor markers are associated with clinical outcomes.
As expected, the current analysis also demonstrated
that liver metastases are an independent adverse factor for
overall survival and time to treatment failure. This is concordant with the results of a previous analysis in patients
with advanced cancer in which liver metastasis was an independent factor predicting poor survival.33 In addition,
smoking predicted shorter time to treatment failure, but it
did not predict response and survival.
In contrast with other types of cancer treated in our
Phase I Clinical Trials Program, such as thyroid cancer,
which showed superior TTF with phase 1 treatments
compared with prior standard of care therapies,34 phase 1
therapies in pancreatic cancer were not associated with
longer TTF. This observation may be because of late
referral and advanced underlying disease of the patients
referred, as evidenced by the fact that 21% of evaluable
patients (16 of 78) did not reach the time of tumor
response assessment secondary to clinical progression.
Also, patients who received >1 therapy before referral to
the Phase I Clinical Trials Program had shorter TTF in
multivariate analysis (Table 3).
Considering the relatively small number of patients
included in the current series, which precludes robust statistical results, some caution is warranted in the interpretation of some observations. In general, patients with
pancreatic cancer referred to our program had good PS
and adequate organ function. Another limitation of our
study is that quality of life was not assessed.
The fact that the median overall survival duration
from the time of diagnosis was 22.1 months (range, 18.126.5) suggests that there was a selection bias toward more
favorable patients being referred. Even so, our results

suggest that treatment on a phase 1 clinical trial is a reasonable approach for these patients. Identification of molecular mechanisms involved in the development of
pancreatic cancer may lead to the discovery of novel
agents with greater antitumor activity.
