ABSTRACT
Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most frequent bone cancer in childhood and
is characterized by the presence of the balanced translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) in
more than 85% of cases, generating a dysregulated transcription factor EWS/FLI1.
This fusion protein is an essential oncogenic component of ES development which is
necessary for tumor cell maintenance and represents an attractive therapeutic target.
To search for modulators of EWS/FLI1 activity we screened a library of 153 targeted
compounds and identified inhibitors of the PI3K pathway to directly modulate EWS/
FLI1 transcription. Surprisingly, treatment of four different ES cell lines with BEZ235
resulted in down regulation of EWS/FLI1 mRNA and protein by ~50% with subsequent
modulation of target gene expression. Analysis of the EWS/FLI1 promoter region
(−2239/+67) using various deletion constructs identified two 14bp minimal elements
as being important for EWS/FLI1 transcription. We identified SP1 as modulator of
EWS/FLI1 gene expression and demonstrated direct binding to one of these regions
in the EWS/FLI1 promoter by EMSA and ChIP experiments. These results provide
the first insights on the transcriptional regulation of EWS/FLI1, an area that has not
been investigated so far, and offer an additional molecular explanation for the known
sensitivity of ES cell lines to PI3K inhibition.

Extensive evidence supports the notion that
EWS/FLI1 is an essential oncogenic component of ES
development. Its oncogenic activity is thought to be
mediated through inappropriate regulation of target
genes that are crucial for the fully malignant phenotype
[5, 6, 13–17]. So far it is not known which of this target
gene(s) act as crucial oncogenic driver(s). Hence, the
prevalent hypothesis states that EWS/FLI1 is the major
genetic mutation that is necessary for development and
maintenance [18–24] of the tumor although it might not
be sufficient. Since EWS/FLI1 expression is restricted
to tumor cells, it represents an ideal therapeutic target.
However, it acts as transcription factor, which in most
cases are considered undruggable because of lack of
enzymatic activity and their direct pharmacological
inhibition is still challenging. Indeed, EWS/FLI1 behaves
as intrinsically disordered protein and so far cannot be
directly targeted by small molecules in a classical sense.

INTRODUCTION
Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most frequent
bone cancer in childhood. Clinically, ES appears as
very aggressive osteolytic tumor with early tendency for
development of metastasis [1]. It belongs to the group
of small-round-blue-cell tumors and is comprised of
largely undifferentiated cells. The unique feature of this
tumor is the presence of the balanced t(11;22)(q24;q12)
translocation in more than 85% of cases [2]. This gene
rearrangement results in expression of a chimaeric
fusion protein where the RNA binding domain of EWS
is exchanged by the DNA binding domain of the ETS
transcription factor FLI1, thus generating an aberrant
transcription factor EWS/FLI1 [3–6]. More than 18 less
represented alternative translocations involving EWS and
other ETS protein family members have been described
since [7–12].

Therapy of ES today lacks specificity, is ineffective
against metastasis and bears the potential of serious side
effects. In the last few decades there has been considerable
progress in both diagnosis as well as treatment of localized
disease. However, only 15% of patients with metastatic
disease survive and therefore this patient group needs
specific attention. To advance future therapies, one of
the available options lies in a better understanding of the
biology of the fusion protein. Considering the difficulties
in finding direct small molecule inhibitors for transcription
factors, our aim is to study and characterize the cellular
processes affecting or being affected by the fusion protein
and thus providing indirect targeting possibilities. To
identify molecular pathway(s) that might contribute to
the transcriptional activity and oncogenic properties of
EWS/FLI1, we therefore adopted a screening approach
previously described [25], and screened a small molecule
library that includes a broad range of protein kinase
inhibitors covering all major signaling pathways. This
approach led to the identification of SP1 as a direct
regulator of EWS/FLI1 transcription through activation
via the IGF/PI3K/AKT pathway, which is known to play a
role in Ewing sarcoma [26–32] and whose blockage affects
cell growth and survival [33–37]. Hence, we identify a
critical regulatory mechanism upstream of EWS/FLI1.

signaling pathways, both known and unknown to play a
role in sarcomas. The most prominent among them is the
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which was
affected by three different compounds. Inhibition of this
pathway provoked a significant modulation of EWS/FLI1
target genes and a strong inhibition of cell proliferation in
A673. Hence, these experiments identified PI3K signaling
to modulate expression of EWS/FLI1 target genes.
Among the PI3K inhibitors tested was BEZ235,
which is a dual inhibitor of PI3K and the downstream
mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) that induced
the most significant modulation of all three EWS/FLI1
target genes. Hence, we focused on this compound to
further characterize modulation of EWS/FLI1 activity by
the PI3K-mTOR pathway. Interestingly, upon treatment of
four ES cell lines with 500 nM BEZ235 we observed a
decrease of more than 50% of EWS/FLI1 mRNA levels
itself (Figure 1A) that also resulted in a reduction of EWS/
FLI1 protein levels (Figure 1B, 1C and Supplementary
Figure S1) As expected, decrease of EWS/FLI1 mRNA led
to modulation of target gene expression as well (NKX2.2,
NROB1 and PHLDA1). Additional target genes such as
insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3- IGFBP3 [19]
and Lysyl Oxidase -LOX [38], repressed by EWS/FLI1,
and six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate
1-STEAP1 [39] and protein kinase C Beta -PRKCB [40],
activated by EWS/FLI1, were found to be modulated as
well (Supplementary Figure S2A–S2D).
Therefore, this data suggests that PI3K signaling
is involved in transcriptional regulation of EWS/FLI1
expression.

RESULTS
Screening a library of small molecule inhibitors
identifies PI3K pathway as modulator of EWS/
FLI1 expression
To identify molecular pathways that may contribute
to transcriptional activity and oncogenic properties of
EWS/FLI1, we used the previously established and
validated strategy [25] to screen a library of small
molecule inhibitors covering a wide variety of molecular
pathways. The collection of 153 inhibitors (Supplementary
Table S1) was screened for EWS/FLI1 target gene
modulation as primary read out in A673 ES cells at a
final concentration of 500 nM. EWS/FLI1 transcriptional
activity was monitored by expression of the known
target genes pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A,
member 1-PHLDA1 [25], Nuclear Receptor Subfamily
0 Group B Member 1-NROB1 [20], NK2 homeobox
2-NKX2.2 [21] and for EWS/FLI1 itself. Expression
of PHLDA1 is repressed by EWS/FLI1, in contrast
to NROB1 and NKX2.2 which are activated. General
cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined by WST1 assay, a colorimetric assay based on the cleavage of a
tetrazolium salt, to form formazan in viable cells. The final
hit-list was based on significant (p < 0.05, unpaired twotailed t-test) modulation of at least two out of three target
genes compared to untreated controls in A673 cells. The
top 16 inhibitory compounds obtained from the screen are
shown in Table 1 and included inhibitors targeting several

BEZ235 treatment induces cell cycle arrest
As described above, treatment with 500 nM
BEZ235 for 24 hrs resulted in a decrease of EWS/FLI1
protein levels (Figure 1B and 1C) and as a consequence
in PHLDA1 upregulation, which in turn led to a dose
dependent reduction of viable cells compared to nontreated controls (Supplementary Figure S3A). To verify
that the drug affected cell proliferation we stained the
cells with crystal violet after drug treatment with 500 nM
BEZ235 for 24 and 48 hrs. We observed a reduction of
cell numbers by 40% and 70% compared to the DMSO
control in A673 and 48% and 77% in SKNMC cells.
Nevertheless, reduction in cell numbers was much more
pronounced when cells were treated with Staurosporin
or Nocodazole (Supplementary Figure S3B–S3E).
Hence, BEZ235 seems to affect cell proliferation
without decreasing viability. To investigate whether the
compound induces cell death, we investigated PARP
cleavage by Western blot. As shown in Figure 1B
treatment with 500 nM BEZ235 resulted in minor PARP
cleavage only. Subsequently, we investigated Casp3 and
7 activity both with the Casp3/7 Glo assay and at protein
levels (Supplementary Figure S4A and S4B and data not

we conclude that BEZ235 treatment induces a cell cycle
arrest, similar to what has been reported earlier [24].
Since the effect of BEZ235 on cell cycle progression
could be due to inhibition of PI3K pathway or to EWS/
FLI1 reduction, we also investigated the role of EWS/
FLI1 in cell cycle progression. We depleted EWS/FLI1
both in A673 and SKNMC using 10 nM of siRNA for 48
hrs and analyzed the cell cycle distribution. Our results
showed that depletion of EWS/FLI1 does not induce cell
cycle arrest (Supplementary Figure S6A and S6B), but
rather provokes a subG1 peak in SKNMC cells. This
was also validated at protein level where EWS/FLI1
depletion provoked Casp7 activation and PARP cleavage
in SKNMC (Supplementary Figure S6D), but not in
A673 cells (Supplementary Figure S6C). In addition,
crystal violet staining showed a reduction in cell numbers
by 40% in SKNMC cells (Supplementary Figure S6F),
but no effect on A673 cells (Supplementary Figure S6E).
Taken together these data show that BEZ235 affects cell
numbers mainly by inducing cell cycle arrest in ES cells.

due to the presence of EWS/FLI1, we performed the same
assays in prostate cancer cells lacking the fusion protein.
As shown in Supplementary Figure S7B, target genes of
EWS/FLI1, while well expressed at endogenous levels in
this cell type, are not affected by PI3K inhibition.

PI3K signaling controls EWS/FLI1 transcription
at its promoter
Since levels of wt FLI1 did not change upon
inhibition of the PI3K pathway while at the same
time EWS/FLI1 mRNA expression was reduced, we
hypothesized that this control of EWS/FLI1 transcription
occurs within the EWS promoter. To test this notion, we
conducted reporter assays with a plasmid containing the
2.3 kb promoter of EWS in front of the luciferase gene.
A673 ES cells were transfected with this construct and
treated with increasing concentrations of BEZ235 for
24 hrs (Figure 3A). Interestingly, we observed a dose
dependent decrease in luciferase activity which was not the
case for a constitutive promoter thereby excluding effects
of the compound on stability of luciferase itself. Already
50 nM of BEZ235 was able to reduce luciferase activity
by 50% without affecting cell viability implying that
indeed this promoter region contains a regulatory element
responsive to PI3K signaling (Figure 3A). To narrow
down the region of interest we designed several deletion
constructs and performed reporter assays as before. Even
the smallest construct of -275bp still responded to BEZ235
treatment. Hence, a regulatory element must be contained
within this promoter element (Figure 3B).
To pinpoint further this potential regulatory
element within the −275/+67 region of the promoter,
we designed an additional series of deletion constructs
in which 12–14bp were deleted in the context of the full
size promoter (Figure 3C). If the responsible regulatory
element is excised from the promoter we expect to lose
any difference in luciferase activity upon drug treatment.
Indeed, two constructs out of 24 did not respond to drug
anymore, namely deletion 2 and deletion 23 (Figure 3D).
Interestingly, both deletions also lost basal activity by
more than 50% (Figure 3C). Therefore, our results suggest
that inhibition of PI3K pathway affects gene expression of
EWS/FLI1 mainly via two regions of the EWS promoter.

PI3K protein depletion reduces EWS/FLI1
expression
To exclude off-target effects of the small molecule
inhibitor BEZ235, we performed genetic loss-of-function
experiments using siRNA targeting the catalytic domains
α, δ and γ of class I PI3Ks in A673 and SKNMC cells.
Silencing for 48 hrs resulted in down regulation of PI3K α,
δ and γ mRNA by 75% compared to scrambled control as
measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 2A). In silenced
cells PHLDA1 was up regulated by 10 fold, whereas
target genes NROB1, NKX2.2 and Caveolin1 [41] were
repressed by 70%, 55% and 45%, respectively (Figure
2B). Notably, expression of EWS/FLI1 itself was inhibited
by 65%, whereas only a non-significant alteration of wt
FLI1, used as negative control, was observed. These
results were confirmed at the protein level since 48 hrs
after treatment with PI3K specific siRNAs, EWS/FLI1
protein expression decreased while PHLDA1 protein
level increased. As expected, silencing of PI3K decreased
phosphorylation of its downstream effectors AKT, mTOR
and S6 ribosomal protein as shown by phospho-specific
antibodies (Figure 2C). The same result was confirmed
in SKNMC cells where depletion of PI3Kαγδ led to
a decrease of EWS/FLI1 protein levels, whereas the
depletion of each single component did not affect the
fusion protein (Supplementary Figure S7A). In addition,
we performed immunofluorescence analysis to confirm
the reduction of EWS/FLI1 after silencing of the PI3K
components on the single cell level. As shown in Figure
2D (lower panel), after silencing of the three subunits,
EWS/FLI1 is barely detectable anymore. Altogether, these
results confirm regulation of EWS/FLI1 transcription by
the PI3K pathway also at the genetic level. To validate that
the effect on EWS/FLI1 target genes by the compound is

SP1 is involved in transcriptional regulation of
EWS/FLI1
Our results point to an unknown transcription factor
that binds to a specific region in the EWS promoter and
whose activity can be stimulated by the PI3K pathway.
Therefore, we used the sequence covered by Del23 to
identify transcription factor candidates in silico. Using the
programs Alibaba 2.2 and P-Match based on consensus
sequences and Genome Browser based on ChIP datasets,
we identified four potential candidates, C-Rel, YY1,

NFKB and SP1, all known downstream targets of the
PI3K pathway (Figure 4A). To determine which of these
transcription factors might be involved in EWS/FLI1 gene
expression, we performed siRNA depletion of each of
the candidates and measured EWS/FLI1 gene expression
together with its target gene NROB1 by qRT-PCR
(Figure 4B) Knockdown of SP1 led to a reduction of EWS/
FLI1 levels by 50% compared to control also at protein
level (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S8A, S8B),
whereas the other candidates did not affect EWS/FLI1

neither at the level of gene expression nor at protein
level (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S9A–S9D).
Also in this case, immunofluorescence analysis after SP1
depletion revealed barely detectable levels of EWS/FLI1,
further strengthening the previous observation (Figure 4E
and Supplementary Figure S10A and S10B). The same
assays have been performed also in prostate cancer cells
where SP1 depletion did not affect the levels of the target
genes (Supplementary Figure S8C). To further validate
our observations, we combined the knockdown of SP1

with 500 nM BEZ235 treatment for 24 hrs and observed
an additive reduction of EWS/FLI1 levels (Figure 5A
and  5B) both at gene expression and at protein level.
Taken together we conclude that PI3K pathway regulates
gene expression of EWS/FLI1 through SP1 activity.
To better understand the relation between the PI3K
pathway and SP1 in ES cells, we investigated whether
its activity is modulated by PI3K signaling. Since knock
down of PI3K αγδ subunits induces a similar decrease of
EWS/FLI1 mRNA and protein as depletion of SP1 (Figure
4D and 4F), we hypothesized that PI3K could directly
affect SP1 levels. Since SP1 is a transcription factor and
it is mainly located in the nucleus, we investigated SP1
protein levels after treatment for 24 and 48 hrs with either
BEZ235 or Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTORC1
complex, in the nuclear fraction. Indeed, we observed
a clear decrease of SP1 protein (Figure 6A and 6B).
This was confirmed by immunofluorescence stainings
showing a clear decrease of SP1 levels after 500 nM
BEZ235 treatment also in a non-Ewing cell line such
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as human foreskin fibroblasts-HFF (Figure 6C). These
results suggest that inhibition of PI3K pathway reduces
SP1 activity, most likely via phosphorylation dependent
mechanisms.

SP1 directly binds to the Del23 region
To demonstrate direct binding of SP1 to the
Del23 region of the EWS/FLI1 promoter, we performed
electrophoretic mobility shift assays using biotinylated
double strand oligonucleotides covering the DNA
sequence of Del23 (Figure 7A). Addition of nuclear extract
produced a shift that could be competed by addition of
an excess of unlabeled Del23 oligonucleotide (Figure
7B, lanes 2, 3), indicating that the Del23 region is indeed
bound by protein. This shift could also be competed
with an SP1 specific oligonucleotide (lane 4) as well as
with a specific antibody against SP1 (lane 5), but not by
addition of a control antibody (actin, lane 6). Specificity
of the assay was further validated with a mutant Del23

by addition of the SP1 antibody (lane 15, 17). Hence, these
experiments suggest that the Del23 region of the EWS/
FLI1 promoter is bound specifically by SP1 that does not
bind to the Del2 sequence.
To verify this notion, we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays in two different Ewing
cell lines (A673 and SKNMC) (Figure 7C and 7D).
Using oligonucleotides spanning the Del23 region of
the EWS promoter, a fragment could be enriched by
immunoprecipitation with the SP1 antibody as well as
with the control H3 antibody, but not with the unspecific
IgG control. All together, these results indicate that SP1
indeed binds to the Del23 sequence in the promoter of
EWS to modulate its transcriptional expression.

of several enzymes downstream of the EWS/FLI1 fusion
protein, such as IGF1R, and did not attempt to modulate
the activity of this likely most crucial factor for ES
oncogenesis itself.
Here, we conducted a screen of a library of small
molecule targeted inhibitors affecting a broad range of
different signaling pathways in order to define potential
novel nodes directed at the fusion protein. For this, we
employed the previously described and well established
screening approach that uses expression of three EWS/
FLI1 target genes, both repressed as well as activated, as
surrogate markers of EWS/FLI1 activity [25]. As the most
prominent pathway that was able to modulate EWS/FLI1
target gene expression the P3IK pathway emerged. This
came as no surprise, since the importance of the IGFR1PI3K-AKT axis has been demonstrated already in numerous
studies [29, 30, 46–48], and triggered several clinical trials.
However, using BEZ235, a dual PI3K/ mTOR inhibitor,
as the most potent compound in our hit list we observed a
strong decrease in EWS/FLI1 activity and surprisingly this
occurs as consequence of a reduction at protein and RNA
level of the fusion protein. In addition, since there was a

reduction in cell number after treatment, also an effect on
cell cycle progression has been noticed in agreement with
Manara et al [34]. We hypothesize that the G1 arrest is
due to the reduction of EWS/FLI1 levels, whereas further
depletion causes cell death in SKNMC cells which are
more sensitive than A673 (Supplementary Figure S6C).
In agreement with the observed cell cycle arrest, reduced
tumor growth was observed when mice were treated with
BEZ235 after engraftment of TC71 ES cells [34], with
regression induced when combined with vincristine.
Indeed, very little is known about the regulation
of EWS/FLI1 transcription and even less about fusion
protein turnover. So far, only one study was conducted that
implied some possible regulatory regions in the EWSR1
promoter [49]. However, it has been shown previously that
inhibition of mTOR by Rapamycin can decrease EWS/
FLI1 protein levels [50] similar to what we observed with
Rapamycin treatment in A673 cells (Figure 6A).
Inhibition of the PI3K pathway triggered repression
of EWS/FLI1 transcription also when the pathway
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was genetically inhibited by specific siRNA treatment.
However, we found that it was not sufficient to deplete
one PI3K isoform but simultaneous down regulation of
PI3K catalytic subunits α,γ and δ was necessary. This
can probably be explained by the lack of mutations in
any of these subunits in ES. Thus, the application of
more isoform specific inhibitors might be limited and
compensatory effects might explain the superior activity
of BEZ235 from our panel of inhibitors tested.
Several additional inhibitors were identified from
our screen, most notably two γ-secretase inhibitors.
However, efforts to genetically verify a potential role
of Notch receptors in EWS/FLI1 expression were not
successful. This does not exclude a role of the pathway
in ES biology as it has been demonstrate already that
inhibition of notch can trigger neural differentiation of
ES cells [51]. In addition, the most dramatic reduction
in cell proliferation was seen with the survivin inhibitor
YM155. Indeed, survivin protein and mRNA are found
up regulated in ES cells, its expression constitutes a poor

prognostic marker [52] and genetic knockdown reduced
proliferation [53].
We used luciferase reporter assays to characterize for
the first time a direct role of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway
in transcriptional regulation of the EWS/FLI1 promoter.
This effect could be narrowed down to a regulatory element
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

within the promoter, namely the Del23 region, that was
bound by the transcription factor SP1 as shown by gel
shift and ChIP assays. SP1 is ubiquitously expressed, and
binds to GC rich motifs in general. Nevertheless, SP1 did
not bind to additional GC-rich regions in the promoter such
as Del2. SP1 has recently been described to be activated

Quantitative PCR

via phosphorylation by PI3K Cζ [54] and in addition, SP1
inhibitors, such as Mithramycin, have notable effect on
EWS/FLI1 protein activity [55]. Mechanistically, it is still
not entirely clear how SP1 activity is regulated by the PI3K
pathway. However, we found that treatment specifically
reduced SP1 levels, similar to what has been shown
previously [56]. However, whether direct phosphorylation
at one of the many known sites of SP1 is responsible for this
effect, remains to be characterized.
Targeting IGFR1-PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling has
shown promising results in Ewing sarcoma [42, 44, 45,
57]. Our demonstration that inhibition of the pathway
directly impairs expression of the fusion protein itself
provides additional support for its therapeutic development
[58]. Most promising appear to be combinations with other
targeted agents that might modulate EWS/FLI1 activity
such as YK-4–279 [59] or epigenetic modifiers that can
potentially further suppress transcription of the fusion
protein. Hence, elucidating the transcriptional regulation
of EWS/FLI1 might provide additional molecular targets
for this devastating disease.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed
under universal cycling conditions on an ABI 7900
instrument using commercially available target probes
and mastermix (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific AG).
Data were analyzed using SDS 2.2 software (Thermo
Fisher Scientific AG). CT values were normalized to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Relative expression levels of the target genes were
calculated using the ΔΔCT method. All experiments were
performed in triplicate and repeated independently at
least 3 times. Data analysis was done with the GraphPad
prism software (San Diego, CA, USA) and statistical

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines

siRNA treatments

Three type 1 (A673, SKNMC, TC71) and two
type 2 Ewing cell lines (SKES, RDES) were used. TC71
cells were kindly provided by Prof H. Kovar (St-Anna
Children’s Hospital, Vienna, Austria) and SKES and
RDES by Prof. K.L. Schaefer (Institute of Pathology,
Duesseldorf, Germany), A673, HFF and PC3 cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture CollectionATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultivated
on 0.2% gelatin coated plates (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs,
Switzerland) in RPMI medium (DMEM for PC3 cells)
supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich), 1%
Penicillin/Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific AG,
Reinach, Switzerland), 1% L-glutamine (Bioconcept AG,
Allschwil, Switzerland), at 37°C in 5% CO2.

A total of 2 × 106 A673 cells were seeded per 60
mm dish. On the same day, transfection was carried out
using LipofectamineRNAi MAX reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific AG) and 10 nM siRNA of FLI1 (5266), SP1_1
(s13319), SP1_2 (s13320), C-Rel (s11906), NFKB (s9504),
YY1 (s224779) PI3K α (s10520), PI3K δ (s10530), PI3K
γ (s10532). As a negative control scrambled siRNA no. 2
(s4390846) was used. All products were purchased from
Thermo Fisher Scientific AG. Cells were lysed 48 hrs
after silencing and subsequent RNA extraction using RNA
easy mini kit (Qiagen Instruments AG, Hombrechtikon,
Switzerland) was performed followed by cDNA synthesis
with RT kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific AG).

Immunoblotting

Screening assay

Cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested
in lysis buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 150
mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM Na3OV4, 5 mM Napyrophosphate, 40 nM NaF, 1 mM EGTA supplemented
with protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete + 1 mM EDTA,
Roche Diagnostics AG). For the preparation of nuclear
fraction cells were lysed in 0.1% NP40, washed twice
with PBS, centrifuged, and the supernatant discarded.
The nuclear pellet was lysed in Roti-Load 1X (Carl Roth
GmbH+Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany).
Protein concentration was determined by Bradford
(Biorad, Reinach, Switzerland) and BCA (Thermo Fisher
Scientific AG). 10–30 μg of protein extract was resolved
on 4–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose

1.5 × 104 cells were plated in 96-well plates 24 hrs
prior to treatment. A library of 153 commercially available
targeted inhibitors was acquired from AxonMedchem
(Groningen, The Netherlands) and Selleck chemicals
LLC (Munich, Germany) (See Supplementary Table S1).
Compounds were added to cells in complete RPMI
medium at a final concentration of 500 nM for 24 hrs.
Lysis and subsequent cDNA synthesis was performed
using AffinityScript QPCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Agilent
Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland, #600559), followed
by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Cell viability was measured
in parallel using WST-1 cell proliferation kit (Roche
Diagnostics AG, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).

ChIP assay
1 × 107 cells were plated and cross-linked after
24 hrs with 1% formaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific
AG) for 5–10 minutes at RT. Formaldehyde was quenched
by adding 125 mM Glycine (Sigma-Aldrich) for
5 minutes. Cells were collected, washed twice with cold
PBS and lysed in IP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1.0% Triton
X-100). The crude extract was washed twice with IP
buffer and sonicated 15 times for 20s [60]. Samples were
incubated overnight at 4°C with the anti SP1 (Millipore),
anti H3 (Cell Signalling) or anti IgG (Cell Signalling)
antibodies and then immunoprecipitated (Active
Motif kit). Primers (Microsynth AG) were as follows:
CGAGTAAGCGGTGGTTCATC (forward).

Luciferase assays
The promoter region of EWS/FLI1 (Ref. sequence
NM_013986) covering 2.3kb (position -2239/+67 relative
to the transcription initiation site) was cloned in pGL4.19
luciferase vector (Promega AG, Madison, WI, USA)
using Infusion HD cloning kit (Clontech Laboratories,
Inc Mountain View, CA,USA). With the same approach
several deletion constructs of the EWS/FLI1 promoter
were made, namely -1708/+67 -1277/+67, -774/+67,
-275/+67. Using a site directed mutagenesis kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific AG), 24 additional deletion mutants of
the -275/+67 construct were made (see Supplementary
Table S2 for a detailed list of the plasmids). All constructs
were verified by sequencing.
2 × 104 A673 cells per well were plated in 96-well
plate and transfected 24 hrs later using Jet Prime (Polyplus
Transfection, Strasbourg, France) with 100 ng of reporter
construct, or empty vector (pGL4.19) as a negative control.
For normalization, cells were co-transfected with 10 ng of
a renilla luciferase plasmid. After 24 hrs cells were treated
with 50 nM BEZ235 or DMSO. 48 hrs post transfection
they were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the
Dual Glo luciferase reporter system (Promega AG).

Immunofluorescence
Cells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 4%
PFA, washed again with PBS and then with PBS-0.1%
TritonX. Hereafter, they were incubated overnight with
the primary antibody - FLI1 (1:50) (Sigma-Aldrich),
SP1 (1:500) (Millipore), - diluted in PBS-0.1% TritonX
with 4% Horse Serum (Sigma-Aldrich). Afterwards, cells
were washed and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature
with the secondary antibody (1:500) diluted in PBS 4% horse serum (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were washed
twice with PBS and once with distilled water; one drop
of Dapi (Vechtashield H-1200, Vector Laboratories, Inc.
Burlingame, CA, USA) added and analyzed with a Zeiss
inverted microscope.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
1 × 107 cells were plated, washed once with PBS
24 hrs later and lysed in Buffer A (10 mM Hepes pH 7.9,
10 mMKCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT,
0.5 mM PMSF) containing 10% NP40. The nuclear pellet
was transferred to Buffer C (20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 0.4
M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1x complete Mini-Roche tablet).
40 μg of nuclear extract, 100 nM of biotinylated oligo,
4 μM of unlabelled probe, 1 μL of anti-SP1 (Millipore)
or anti Actin antibodies (Cell Signalling) were mixed.
