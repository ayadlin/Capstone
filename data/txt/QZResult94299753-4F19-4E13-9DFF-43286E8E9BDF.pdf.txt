Targeting Lymphomas Through MALT1 Inhibition
Lorena Fontan and Ari Melnick
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most
common form of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, comprises
a heterogeneous group of diseases that can be classified
into at least three different entities with distinct gene
expression signatures. Among these, the activated B
cell-like (ABC)-DLBCLs are the most resistant to
current standard immune-chemotherapy regimens [1].
Development of novel targeted therapies with activity
in this DLBCL subtype is required to improve clinical
outcome for these patients.
Efforts to identify recurrent somatic mutations in
ABC-DLBCLs have revealed common biological themes
despite their considerable genetic heterogeneity. Most
notably frequent activating somatic mutation in B-cell
receptor (BCR) and Toll like receptor (TLR) signaling
pathways, leading to constitutive NF-κB activity [2].
Along these lines the MALT1 paracaspase has emerged as
a key signaling mediator and therapeutic target in ABCDLBCLs due to its role in transducing signals from several
receptors implicated in lymphomagenesis [3]. To carry
out its functions MALT1 assembles into a complex with
CARMA1 and BCL10 (CBM complex), which facilitates
TRAF6 induced activation of IKK and p65/c-Rel signaling
(Figure 1) and triggers MALT1 protease activity. MALT1
is distinct from other caspases; it cleaves after Arginine
residues and targets different substrates. Substrates of
MALT1 include the ubiquitin editase A20/TNFAIP3,
the deubiquitinase CYLD, the MALT1 binding protein
BCL10 and the NF-κB subunit RelB [3]. Cleavage of these
proteins enables NF-κB activation ultimately promoting
cell survival and proliferation [3]. Likely MALT1 may
cleave additional proteins yet to be discovered, with
potential implications in various pathways and biological
processes.
The MALT1 gene itself is affected by translocations
in certain mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas
that may either lead to its deregulated expression or to
gain of function activities [3]. More specifically, API2MALT1 fusion results in a gain of function cleavage of the
kinase NIK by constitutively activated MALT1, leading to
aberrant induction of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway
[3].
Its location downstream of multiple lymphomagenic
pathways makes MALT1 an excellent therapeutic target.
Along these lines, a peptide that can bind and inhibit the
MALT1 catalytic pocket (Z-VRPR-FMK) was shown to
downregulate NF-κB activity, suppress proliferation and
induce apoptosis in ABC-DLBCL cell lines known to

contain mutations in TLR and BCR signaling components
[4, 5]. These data revealed that MALT1 is a bona fide
therapeutic target, inhibition of which may disrupt
oncogenic signaling induced by somatic mutations in
ABC-DLBCLs. However Z-VRPR-FMK is not suitable
as a therapeutic agent due its unfavorable pharmacological
properties.
Fortunately, two recent studies identified small
molecule inhibitors of the MALT1 protease activity
with potent activity against ABC-DLBCL cells both
in vitro and in vivo [6, 7]. One of the studies identified
phenothiazine compounds as mediating reversible MALT1
cleavage inhibition [7]; whereas the other identified a
novel compound termed “MALT1 inhibitor-2” (MI2), that irreversibly binds the active site of MALT1 and
potently suppresses its enzymatic activity at nanomolar
concentrations [6]. Irreversible inhibition of MALT1
by MI-2 is quite appealing since this enables its effect
to be prolonged over time allowing sustained inhibition
of its downstream pathways. It is notable ABC-DLBCL
cell lines with mutations in the BCR pathway upstream
of MALT1 (CD79A/B, CARMA1) or the TLR pathway
(MyD88) were sensitive to MALT1 cleavage inhibition
[6]. In contrast cell lines with mutations downstream of
MALT1 exhibited impaired response to MALT1 cleavage
inhibition [6] suggesting that these should be considered
possible resistance mechanisms. Along these lines Nagel
et al. demonstrated that MALT1 cleavage inhibition
resistance can be induced in cell lines by overexpression
of a constitutively active form of IKKβ that activates
NF-κB downstream of MALT1 [7]. Hence, the rational
translation of MALT1 inhibitors to the clinic will require
the identification of the mutations stimulating aberrant
NF-κB signaling so that the proper therapeutic agents
can be selected to enable maximal efficacy and minimize
tumor resistance.
Inhibition of the BCR signaling mediator BTK
(Bruton Tyrosine Kinase) has emerged as another
promising therapeutic approach for ABC-DLBCLs. The
irreversible BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib has potent activity
in pre-clinical models and promising activity in early
phase clinical trials [8]. However not all ABC-DLBCLs
will benefit from BTK inhibition. For example CARMA1
mutations activate the CBM complex downstream of
BTK and hence render lymphomas unresponsive to BTK
inhibitors, whereas MALT1 inhibitors are still effective
in the presence of CARMA1 mutations. Because recent
data indicate that other B-cell lymphomas are also highly

and proliferation. MALT1 is a mediator of NF-κB activation and indirectly sustains this activation by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling
attenuation mechanisms, A20 and others. Targeting of MALT1 protease activity impairs lymphoma survival by inhibition of NF-κB
signaling, leading to growth inhibition and apoptosis in xenograft models of ABC-DLBCL.

addicted to BCR signaling and may be sensitive to
inhibitors like Ibrutinib (i.e. such as chronic lymphocytic
leukemia), it is likely that MALT1 inhibitors will be
useful beyond ABC-DLBCLs and MALT lymphomas.
Finally, combination of MALT1 and BTK inhibitors or
other targeted anti-lymphoma therapies or chemotherapy
needs to be evaluated to provide maximal suppression
of oncogenic BCR signaling, as well as to suppress
complementary pathways that might enable lymphoma
cell survival (i.e. such as BCL6 and BCL2) and potentially
foster the emergence of resistant clones of lymphoma
cells. .
