Abstract
Clinical studies with bortezomib have validated the proteasome as a therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple
myeloma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. However, significant
toxicities have restricted the intensity of bortezomib dosing.
Here we describe the antitumor activity of PR-171, a novel
epoxyketone-based irreversible proteasome inhibitor that is
currently in clinical development. In comparison to bortezomib, PR-171 exhibits equal potency but greater selectivity for
the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome. In cell
culture, PR-171 is more cytotoxic than bortezomib following
brief treatments that mimic the in vivo pharmacokinetics of
both molecules. Hematologic tumor cells exhibit the greatest
sensitivity to brief exposure, whereas solid tumor cells and
nontransformed cell types are less sensitive to such treatments. Cellular consequences of PR-171 treatment include the
accumulation of proteasome substrates and induction of cell
cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Administration of PR-171 to
animals results in the dose-dependent inhibition of the
chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in all tissues examined
with the exception of the brain. PR-171 is well tolerated when
administered for either 2 or 5 consecutive days at doses
resulting in >80% proteasome inhibition in blood and most
tissues. In human tumor xenograft models, PR-171 mediates
an antitumor response that is both dose and schedule
dependent. The antitumor efficacy of PR-171 delivered on
2 consecutive days is stronger than that of bortezomib
administered on its clinical dosing schedule. These studies
show the tolerability, efficacy, and dosing flexibility of PR-171
and provide validation for the clinical testing of PR-171 in the
treatment of hematologic malignancies using dose-intensive
schedules. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6383–91]

Introduction
The proteasome is a multicatalytic protease complex that is
responsible for the ubiquitin-dependent turnover of cellular
proteins (1–3). Proteasome substrates include misfolded or
misassembled proteins as well as short-lived components of
signaling cascades that regulate cell proliferation and survival
pathways. Inhibition of the proteasome results in the accumulation
of these substrate proteins and leads to cell death (4). The catalytic

core of the proteasome includes three proteolytic activities that are
commonly described by their substrate selectivities (5): chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like. Each proteasome active
site uses the side chain hydroxyl group of an NH2-terminal
threonine as the catalytic nucleophile, a mechanism that
distinguishes the proteasome from other cellular proteases (3).
Clinical validation of the proteasome as a therapeutic target in
oncology has been provided by the dipeptide boronic acid
bortezomib (also known as PS-341 or Velcade; refs. 4, 6).
Bortezomib is a covalent, slowly reversible inhibitor that primarily
targets the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome (7).
Bortezomib has proven efficacious as a single agent in multiple
myeloma (8) and some forms of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL;
refs. 9, 10). The cellular mechanism(s) responsible for the clinical
efficacy of bortezomib remain unclear, but may include disruption
of cell adhesion– and cytokine-dependent survival pathways, in
part through suppression of NF-nB activity (11, 12), inhibition of
angiogenesis (13), and/or activation of a misfolded protein stress
response (14, 15). Although the clinical success of bortezomib is
encouraging, a significant fraction of patients remain refractory to
treatment (8–10). Furthermore, a number of toxicities including
painful peripheral neuropathy (16) and thrombocytopenia (17)
have restricted bortezomib to a biweekly day 1/day 4 dosing
schedule that allows full recovery of proteasome activity between
doses (18, 19). Therefore, clinical evaluation of additional
proteasome inhibitor classes is warranted. Two irreversible
proteasome inhibitors are currently under development: (a)
salinosporamide A (NPI-0052), a natural product related to
lactacytsin (20–22) and (b) PR-171, a modified peptide related to
the natural product epoxomicin.
Epoxomicin was identified based on its in vivo antitumor activity
(23) and subsequently shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor
of the proteasome (24). Epoxomicin and its analogues are
comprised of two key elements: a peptide portion that selectively
binds in the substrate binding pocket(s) of the proteasome with
high affinity and an epoxyketone pharmacophore that stereospecifically interacts with the catalytic threonine residue to irreversibly
inhibit enzyme activity. X-ray crystallography has shown that
epoxomicin forms a dual covalent morpholino adduct with the
proteasome that requires the close juxtaposition of both the side
chain hydroxyl and a-amino groups of the active site threonine
residue (25). This unique mechanism imparts a high degree of
specificity to the proteasome relative to the active sites of other
protease classes.
Medicinal chemistry efforts focused on increasing the potency
and chymotrypsin-like selectivity of epoxomicin resulted in the
identification of YU-101 (26), a synthetic tetrapeptide epoxyketone
analogue. PR-171, a derivative of YU-101 with improved pharmaceutical properties, is currently under evaluation in phase I clinical

trials in multiple myeloma and NHL. In the present study, we
describe the in vitro characterization and preclinical pharmacology
of PR-171. We show that PR-171 is a potent and selective inhibitor
of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome, both in vitro
and in vivo. In addition, we show that proteasome inhibition by PR171 promotes apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell lines, and that
daily dosing schedules that induce high levels of proteasome
inhibition in vivo are well tolerated and result in antitumor activity
in several xenograft models.

Materials and Methods
Materials. PR-171 was synthesized as described by Smyth and Laidig
(27). [3H]-PR-171 was generated by Pd-catalyzed tritiation of a 2-Br-Phe
analogue of PR-171. Bortezomib was purchased from a local pharmacy.
PR-171 and bortezomib stock solutions were prepared in DMSO and were
diluted 100-fold for 20S proteasome assays or 400-fold for cell treatments.
7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)–conjugated fluorogenic proteasome
substrates were acquired from Boston Biochem (succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-TyrAMC and Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC) or Biomol (Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-AMC and Z-ValGly-Arg-AMC). Purified human 20S proteasome, 20S immunoproteasome,
and clasto-lactacystin h-lactone were purchased from Boston Biochem.
Tissue culture media and horse serum were from Mediatech and fetal bovine
serum (FBS) was from HyClone. Primary antibodies recognizing the following
proteins were purchased from commercial sources: h-catenin, p21, cyclin B1,
hsp27 phospho-Ser82, and actin from Cell Signaling Technology; ubiquitin
from Biomol; and hsp27 and hsp70 from Abcam. Horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)–conjugated secondary antibodies were acquired from Biosource.
Cell lines. Tumor cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and were cultured in media recommended by the supplier.
Nontransformed human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) and
normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and their culture media
[endothelial cell medium-2 (EGM-2) and fibroblast growth medium-1
(FGM-2), respectively] were obtained from Cambrex. All cells were
maintained at 37jC in 5% CO2.
Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) and female BALB/c
(7–9 weeks old) and BNX (5–7 weeks old) mice were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories and housed for 1 week before experimentation.
For all experiments, animals had access to food and water ad libitum. All
experiments were done under protocols approved by an institutional animal
care and use committee.
20S proteasome assays. Proteasome chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like,
and trypsin-like activities were determined using succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-TyrAMC (10 Amol/L), Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC (10 Amol/L), and Boc-Leu-Arg-ArgAMC (50 Amol/L), respectively, with purified human 20S proteasome (2, 4,
and 8.0 nmol/L, respectively) or HT-29 cell lysate (0.125, 0.25, and 0.25 Ag
protein/mL, respectively). Assay buffer consisted of TE buffer [20 mmol/L
Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 mmol/L EDTA] with (20S) or without (cell lysate) 0.03%
SDS. Reactions were initiated by enzyme or lysate addition and monitored
for AMC product formation at 27jC with a plate-based spectofluorometer
(Tecan). IC50 values were determined based on the reaction velocity
measured between 60 and 75 min. To evaluate the kinetics of proteasome
inhibition, first-order rate constants (k obs) were derived from reaction
progress curves for each inhibitor concentration. k inact/K i values were
then determined from the slopes of the double reciprocal plot of 1/k obs
versus 1/[inhibitor] according the equation 1/k obs= 1/k inact + K i/k inact
(1/[inhibitor]).
Cell viability and cellular proteasome activity assays. Drug treatments were done in RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin (transformed cell lines), FGM-2 (NHDF) or
EGM-2 (HUVEC). Cells were exposed to compounds or 0.25% DMSO at 37jC
either continuously for 72 h or for a 1-h period followed by three washes
with media (RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS) and incubation for an
additional 72 h. Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo reagent
(Promega). For cellular proteasome activity assays, cell lysates were
prepared by hypotonic lysis either immediately following the 1-h drug

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

treatment or after the washout and incubation at 37jC for an additional 4,
24, or 72 h. Fluorogenic peptide substrates were mixed with the lysates and
proteasome activities determined by the initial rate ( first 10 min) of AMC
product formation. For proteasome activity recovery studies, background
was subtracted based on the slope of fully inhibited samples, and the rates
were normalized to the number of viable cells in each sample as determined
by the CellTiter-Glo assay.
Apoptosis assays. Tumor cell lines were treated with either PR-171,
bortezomib, or 0.25% DMSO for 1 h followed by a washout as described
above. RPMI 8226 and HS-Sultan cells were treated with 500 nmol/L drug,
whereas HT-29 cells were treated with 2 Amol/L drug. Cells were collected
at 24 h (all cell types) and 72 h (HT-29 only) posttreatment. For
measurement of apoptosis, cells were stained for surface annexin V and
propidium iodide permeability using the BD Bioscience Apoptosis kit and
the percentage of annexin V–positive cells was determined by flow
cytometry. Induction of effector caspase activity (caspase 3/7) was
evaluated in HS-Sultan cells exposed to a range of PR-171 concentrations
for 1 h followed by a 5-h washout period. Caspase 3/7 activity was
determined by Z-DEVD-R100 substrate cleavage with the Apo-ONE assay kit
(Promega).
Western blot analysis. RPMI 8226 cells were treated for 1 h at 37jC with
either 500 nmol/L PR-171, 500 nmol/L bortezomib, or 0.25% DMSO. HT-29
cells were treated for 1 h at 37jC with either 2 Amol/L PR-171, 2 Amol/L
bortezomib, or 0.25% DMSO. After compound treatment, the cells were
washed twice with media as described above and incubated at 37jC for an
additional 4 or 24 h. The cells were then washed in PBS and lysed in PBS
containing 0.2% TX-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysate
proteins were resolved on NuPage gels (Invitrogen), transferred to
nitrocellulose, and probed with the indicated antibodies. Immunoreactive
bands were revealed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody staining
followed by chemiluminescence detection (Pierce).
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. For pharmacokinetic
analysis, PR-171 was given to rats (n = 4 per dose group) as an i.v. bolus
(1 mL/kg) at 2, 4.5, and 9 mg/kg in a solution containing 5% (w/v)
hydroxypropyl-h-cyclodextrin (Roquette) and 50 mmol/L sodium citrate
(pH 3.5). Blood samples were collected at 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min
postdose, and plasma PR-171 concentrations were measured in duplicate
by LC/MS-MS. Pharmacokinetic analyses were done using WinNonlin
(Pharsight Corp.). For pharmacodynamic studies, PR-171 was formulated in
an aqueous solution of 10% (w/v) sulfobutylether-h-cyclodextrin (Cydex)
and 10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH 3.5) for administration to rats
(0.1–9 mg/kg) and mice (5–10 mg/kg). Bortezomib was formulated in
saline containing 10 mg/mL mannitol for administration to mice at
1 mg/kg. At selected time points after i.v. drug administration, tissue
samples (adrenal, brain, heart, liver, lung, and tumors) were collected and
frozen at 80jC. After thawing, tissue samples were homogenized in two
volumes of lysis buffer. Whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture into
tubes containing sodium heparin. Rat splenocytes (isolated by mechanical
disruption) and bone marrow ( flushed from the tibia) were washed with
PBS and depleted of erythrocytes by hypotonic lysis (BD Pharmalyse; BD
PharMingen). Whole blood, splenocytes, and bone marrow cells were
washed twice with PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer and frozen at 80jC.
Tissue homogenates and cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and
supernatants were collected for protein quantitation and proteasome
activity determination using fluorogenic peptide substrates as described
above.
Quantitative whole body autoradiography. Radiolabeled [3H]-PR-171
(250 ACi per animal) was given as an i.v. bolus to rats at a total dose of
2 mg/kg. Animals were sacrificed 0.5 h postdose and underwent whole-body
perfusion with saline before being frozen. Sections were taken to identify
organs of interest, and radioactivity levels in tissues were calculated using
the AIS software (Imaging Research Corp.). These studies were done at
Covance Laboratories.
Xenograft studies. Tumors were established by s.c. injection of cell lines
(passage number <9 and viability >95% at the time of implantation) in the
right flank of BNX mice (n = 7 per group). For HT-29 and RL studies, cell
suspensions containing 5  106 and 1  107 cells, respectively, in a volume

of 0.1 mL were injected. Mice were randomized into treatment groups and
dosing initiated when tumors reached f50 mm3 (HT-29) or f90 mm3 (RL).
For the HS-Sultan model, 0.2 mL containing 1  107 cells in a 1:1 mixture
with Matrigel (BD Discovery Labware) was injected. Tumor volume was
measured 1 day after implantation, and mice were randomized to treatment
groups and dosing initiated when the average tumor size exceeded the
average size on Day 1 by f100 mm3. PR-171 and bortezomib were given as
described above for pharmacodynamic studies. In all treatment groups,
tumors were measured thrice weekly by recording the longest perpendicular
diameters and tumor volumes were calculated using the equation V
(in mm3) = (length  width2)/2.
Statistical analysis. For comparisons of treatment groups, a one-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis using GraphPad Prism
Software (version 4.01) was done. Statistical significance was achieved when
P < 0.05.

Results and Discussion
PR-171 selectively inhibits proteasome chymotrypsin-like
activity. The peptide epoxyketone YU-101 is a potent and
selective inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S
proteasome (26). However, the low aqueous solubility of this
compound (<1 Ag/mL) limits its utility in vivo. PR-171 is an
analogue of YU-101 that exhibits improved aqueous solubility
(>1000-fold) due to the introduction of an NH2-terminal
morpholino moiety (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the potency and
selectivity of PR-171 for the three proteasome catalytic active
sites, we monitored the rates of fluorogenic peptide substrate
hydrolysis either by purified 20S proteasome or in a cell lysate.
Like YU-101, PR-171 is potent and highly selective for the
inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome
(Table 1). PR-171 also inhibited the chymotrypsin-like activity of
the immunoproteasome (IC50, 33 nmol/L), an IFN-g–inducible
form of the proteasome (28). The ability of PR-171 to inhibit the
proteasome in intact cells was also examined (Fig. 1B). Incubation
of HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with PR-171 for 1 h
resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of all three proteasome
catalytic activities with the chymotrypsin-like activity exhibiting
the greatest sensitivity (IC50, 9 nmol/L). The caspase-like and
trypsin-like activities were inhibited to a greater extent in the
cellular assay (IC50 values, 150–200 nmol/L) than in the isolated
enzyme assay (IC50 values, >1 Amol/L; Table 1). Whether this
reflects differences in the proteasome (e.g., 26S versus 20S) or
cellular environment (e.g., accumulation) remains to be determined. Similar dose-dependent suppression of proteasome activity
was observed in other cell lines with PR-171 (data not shown).
Although PR-171, bortezomib, and salinosmpramide A exhibit
comparable potency on the proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity,
bortezemib and salinosporamide A inhibit the caspase-like and
trypsin-like activities, respectively, with greater potency than PR-171
(Table 1, Fig. 1B; refs. 20, 22). As a result, bortezomib and
salinosporamide A may have a greater impact on overall protein
turnover (29). Mechanistically, the epoxyketone pharmacophore of
PR-171 is more selective for the unique NH2-terminal threonine active
site of the proteasome than either the boronic acid of bortezomib
or the h-lactone of salinosporamide A (3). Both bortezomib and
salinosporamide A have been shown to inhibit certain serine
proteases with micromolar or submicromolar potencies (7, 20). In
contrast, neither epoxomicin (24) nor PR-1711 has significant activity

on other protease classes at concentrations up to 10 Amol/L. The
selectivity of PR-171 for the chymotrypsin-like activity of the
proteasome as well as its weak activity on other protease classes
may contribute to greater tolerability in vivo (see below).
Cellular proteasome activity recovers following PR-171
treatment. Although both PR-171 and bortezomib form covalent
adducts with the proteasome (25, 30), the hydrolytic stability of the
two inhibitor-enzyme complexes differ: the dual covalent morpholino adduct formed with PR-171 is irreversible, whereas the
tetrahedral intermediate formed with bortezomib is slowly
reversible (3). To evaluate the impact of this difference on the
kinetics of proteasome activity recovery in cells, chymotrypsin-like
activity was monitored over the course of 72 h following inhibitor
treatment (Fig. 1C). Despite the irreversible binding of PR-171 to
the proteasome, the rate of recovery of proteasome activity in
cultured cells (t 1/2 f 24 h) was only moderately slower than that
observed with bortezomib. These results suggest that with both
compounds, recovery of proteasome activity is due primarily to
induction of mRNA transcription and de novo proteasome
synthesis (31, 32).
Brief exposure to PR-171 induces apoptosis and growth
arrest in tumor cell lines. The cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects
of proteasome inhibitors are well established (3, 4, 10, 20, 33).
However, most studies assessing the impact of proteasome
inhibition on cells in culture have used extended treatment periods
(24–72 h) that do not reflect the in vivo exposure that is achieved
with either bortezomib or PR-171 due to their rapid clearance from
plasma (see below and ref. 19). Therefore, we evaluated the
cytotoxic effects of PR-171 and bortezomib on a panel of tumor
cell lines and nontransformed cells treated for 1 h followed by a
72-h washout period (Table 2). Following brief exposure, PR-171
was more cytotoxic than bortezomib regardless of cell type, and
both compounds were generally more cytotoxic to hematologic
tumor lines than either solid tumor lines or nontransformed cells.
No differences have been observed between PR-171 and bortezomib with regard to the onset of proteasome inhibition in a number
of cell lines,1 eliminating the possibility that differences in cell
penetration or proteasome accessibility are responsible for these
observations. It is possible that the somewhat slower rate of
proteasome activity recovery following PR-171 treatment results in
greater cytotoxicity.
To evaluate the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of
PR-171, the impact of brief compound exposure on the induction of
apoptosis and growth arrest in tumor cells was examined.
Following treatment with PR-171 for 1 h, apoptosis was rapidly
induced in the two hematologic tumor cell lines (RPMI 8226
and HS-Sultan) with maximum annexin V staining detected by
24 h (Fig. 2A) and effector caspase activation detected as early as
5 h (Fig. 2B). In contrast, HT-29 cells initially growth arrest at 24 h,
with an accumulation of cells in the G2-M and S phases of the cell
cycle (Supplementary Fig. S1) and only later undergo apoptosis
(by 72 h). Brief treatments with PR-171 were more effective than
equivalent concentrations of bortezomib at promoting both
apoptosis and growth arrest.
Brief exposure to PR-171 promotes accumulation of
proteasome substrates and markers of apoptosis or stress
response pathways. To further investigate the pathways activated
by PR-171, Western blot analysis was done on cell lysates prepared
from either RPMI 8226 (Fig. 2C) or HT-29 cells (Fig. 2D) either 4 or
24 h after a 1-h treatment with compound. The markers examined
included direct proteasome substrates as well as markers that

accumulate as a functional consequence of activation of apoptotic,
growth arrest, or stress response pathways. Each of the markers
has been previously shown to accumulate in cells treated for
extended periods with proteasome inhibitors (12, 31, 33–37). The
effects of proteasome inhibition on the different markers varied by
drug, cell line, and time point of analysis. Although accumulation of
polyubiquitin chains was observed in both cell types within 4 h, the
accumulation of other proteasome substrates was cell type specific,
e.g., cyclin B1 in HT-29 and h-catenin in RPMI 8226. Although p21
levels increased in both cell types, the effect was more rapid in
RPMI 8226 cells. The effects of PR-171 on accumulation of these
markers was more pronounced than with bortezomib, consistent
with the greater effects of brief PR-171 exposure on cell viability,
apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. Heat shock protein induction
is a common response to cellular stress, including perturbation of
proteasome function and accumulation of misfolded proteins
(31, 36, 38, 39). Both hsp27 and hsp70 were elevated at the 24-h time
point in both cell lines and with both drugs, suggesting that this is
a shared, but relatively delayed, response to proteasome inhibition.
However, activation of hsp27 through mitogen-activated protein
kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Ser82 (40) was only observed
in RPMI 8226 cells.
The accumulation of cyclin B1 and p21 in HT-29 cells is
consistent with the initial cell cycle arrest observed in these cells.
However, in RPMI 8226 cells, the accumulation of p21 is apparently
insufficient to maintain a growth arrest, presumably due to
stabilization of other proteins and activation of dominant
proapoptotic pathways. The precise mechanistic differences
responsible for the greater sensitivity to proteasome inhibition
and more rapid apoptotic induction seen in the hematologic tumor
cell lines relative to solid tumor cell lines remain to be established.
Prolonged exposure to PR-171 or bortezomib increases
cytotoxicity. Extending PR-171 and bortezomib treatment from 1
to 72 h (conditions that would be difficult to replicate in vivo due to

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

their rapid clearance) resulted in greater cytotoxicity for both
compounds and eliminated the differentials between the two
molecules and between the different cell types (Table 2). Extended
treatment with bortezomib or PR-171 has also been shown to have
potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on primary
human acute myeloid leukemia cells (41). Suppression of
proteasome activity recovery could be responsible for the increases
in cytotoxicity observed with extended exposure. Alternatively,
because both PR-171 and bortezomib are covalent inhibitors, a
time-dependent increase in the degree of proteasome inhibition
could contribute to greater cytotoxicity. We have found that
extending the length of compound exposure from 1 to 6 h results in
greater total proteasome inhibition with both compounds,
particularly on the trypsin-like and caspase-like active sites.1 The
inhibition of multiple proteasome active sites suppresses total
cellular protein turnover to a greater extent than inhibition of the
chymotrypsin-like site alone (29) and may therefore result in
greater cytotoxicity.
PR-171 is cleared rapidly but promotes a widespread
pharmacodynamic response in rodents. In rats, PR-171 was
rapidly cleared from the plasma compartment following i.v.
administration. Noncompartmental analysis of PR-171 pharmacokinetics revealed an average terminal plasma half-life of f15 min.
The estimated steady-state volume of distribution was much larger
than blood volume, suggesting extensive penetration of PR-171 into
peripheral tissues. To determine the pharmacodynamics of PR-171,
blood and tissues isolated from rats 1 h after drug administration
were analyzed for proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity. PR-171
induced a dose-dependent suppression of activity in all tissues
examined except the brain (Fig. 3A), suggesting that despite rapid
entry into cells, the compound does not readily cross the bloodbrain barrier. Liver was relatively insensitive to the pharmacodynamic effects of PR-171 perhaps due to the competition between
drug metabolism and target binding. As expected, the same tissues

that showed chymotrypsin-like inhibition also showed extensive
penetration by [3H]-PR-171 (Fig. 3B). A similarly rapid clearance
(19) and widespread tissue distribution (33, 42) has been reported
for bortezomib. Although the pharmacokinetics and tissue
pharmacodynamics of salinosporamide A have not been thoroughly characterized, its instability in aqueous environments (42) is
likely to result in brief exposure in animals as well. Unlike PR-171
and bortezomib, i.v. administered salinosporamide A inhibits
proteasome activity in the brain (42).
The in vivo proteasome active site selectivities of PR-171 and
bortezomib were examined in mice 1 h after i.v. drug administration (Fig. 3C ). At doses that induced >80% inhibition of
chymotrypsin-like activity in blood, bortezomib, but not PR-171,
was able to mediate pronounced inhibition of the caspase-like

activity. Neither compound had significant activity on the trypsinlike activity. These results are consistent with the active site
selectivity profiles observed in cells (Fig. 1B). Chauhan et al. (20)
have reported similar results with bortezomib and have also shown
that salinosporamide A, at a dose that fully inhibits proteasome
chymotrypsin-like activity in blood, can also partially suppress the
trypsin-like and caspase-like activities.
Proteasome activity recovers in tissues following PR-171
administration. To evaluate the recovery of proteasome activity in
animals, tissues were examined at varying time points after i.v. PR171 administration. With the exception of whole blood, proteasome
activity recovered by 50% to 100% within 24 h following PR-171
dosing in all tissues examined in both mice (Fig. 3D) and rats
(Supplementary Fig. S2 and data not shown). In whole blood,

PR-171 or bortezomib. Tumor cell lines
were treated with PR-171 (solid columns )
or bortezomib (open columns ) for 1 h at a
concentration of either 500 nmol/L (RPMI
8226 and HS-Sultan) or 2 Amol/L (HT-29
cells). Vehicle consisted of 0.25% DMSO
(hatched columns). Cells were harvested

following treatment and analyzed for
apoptosis by cell surface annexin V
staining. Columns, mean from three
experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05;

Effector caspase activity (caspase 3/7; n)
was measured 5 h after compound
washout and is expressed as fold activation
relative to cells treated with 0.25%
DMSO. For comparison, cell viability (5)
was measured 24 h after compound
washout and is expressed as the percent
relative to cells treated with 0.25% DMSO.
C and D, stabilization and accumulation of
markers in tumor cell lines following brief
exposure to proteasome inhibitors. Lysates
were prepared from RPMI 8226 (C ) or
HT-29 (D ) cells 4 and 24 h following a
1-h treatment with 0.25% DMSO, PR-171,
or bortezomib (500 nmol/L for RPMI 8226
and 2 Amol/L for HT-29). Western blot
analysis was done with antibodies
generated against h-catenin, p21, cyclin
B1, hsp27, hsp27 phospho-Ser82, hsp70,
and ubiquitin. Actin was used to verify
the uniformity of gel loading.

a much slower rate of proteasome activity recovery was observed
following PR-171 treatment (<50% recovery after 1 week), highlighting the impact of an irreversible mechanism of action in a cell
type (erythrocytes) that cannot recover activity by making new
proteasomes. Salinosporamide A, due to its irreversible mechanism
(43), also induces proteasome inhibition in blood that recovers
slowly (20). In contrast, complete recovery of proteasome activity
in blood was achieved by 48 h following bortezomib dosing
(Fig. 3D and ref. 20) due to its slowly reversible mechanism of
action. In tissues, recovery from bortezomib-mediated inhibition
was comparable to PR-171 (t 1/2 f 24 h), but faster than blood
recovery, suggesting that new proteasome synthesis, and not
the slow reversibility of bortezomib, plays a dominant role in
proteasome activity recovery in tissues other than whole blood.
In rats, proteasome inhibition and recovery was also examined
following two (QDx2) or five (QDx5) consecutive daily doses of
PR-171 (Supplementary Fig. S2). There were no significant
differences in either the level of inhibition or rate of recovery of
chymotrypsin-like activity in bone marrow following QDx2 dosing
or QDx5 dosing as compared with a single dose. In contrast, a
cumulative inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity was evident in
blood following QDx2 dosing which was even more pronounced

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

following QDx5 dosing of PR-171. This cumulative inhibition is
likely due to the inability of erythrocytes to recover activity
between doses.
Daily dosing of PR-171 is well tolerated. Despite the sustained
proteasome inhibition in erythrocytes and repeated suppression of
proteasome activity in other tissues achieved with the QDx5
schedule, no changes in hematocrit or hemoglobin concentration
were observed, and no significant weight loss was noted in animals
at doses up to 2 mg/kg (data not shown). These results show that
repeated administration of PR-171 in rodents for up to 5
consecutive days is well tolerated even at doses resulting in peak
inhibition of the proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity in excess of
80% in blood and most other tissues (see Fig. 3A). Daily dosing
schedules that prevent full recovery of proteasome activity between
doses and are more intensive than the recommended clinical
dosing schedule for bortezomib and the preclinical dosing schedule
tested with salinosporamide A (biweekly day 1/day 4; refs. 8, 18, 20).
As noted above, it is possible that the greater biochemical
selectivity of PR-171 for the chymotrypsin-like activity of the
proteasome may contribute to greater tolerability in vivo. Other
factors, including biodistribution differences, could also contribute
to distinct safety profiles for the various proteasome inhibitors.

Antitumor Activity of the Proteasome Inhibitor PR-171

Intensive PR-171 dosing results in improved antitumor
efficacy in human tumor xenograft models. The antitumor
activity of PR-171 was evaluated and compared with bortezomib in
BNX mice bearing established human tumor xenografts derived
from three tumor cell lines: HT-29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma;
Fig. 4A), RL (B cell lymphoma; Fig. 4B), and HS-Sultan (Burkitt’s
lymphoma; Fig. 4C). All PR-171 dosing schedules (up to 5 mg/kg
delivered weekly QDx2) were tolerated in the tumor-bearing
animals, resulting in weight loss of <10% (data not shown). The
bortezomib dose (1 mg/kg on a biweekly day 1/day 4 schedule) was
determined to be the maximum tolerated dose in this mouse strain
(see also ref. 44). In all three models, 5 mg/kg PR-171 delivered i.v.
on a weekly QDx2 schedule was more efficacious than 1 mg/kg
bortezomib delivered i.v. on its standard clinical schedule (biweekly
day 1/day 4). When the same 5 mg/kg dose of PR-171 was given on
a day 1/day 4 schedule or combined into a single weekly 10 mg/kg

dose, efficacy was eliminated in the HT-29 model. In addition,
lowering the PR-171 dose to 3 mg/kg on the weekly QDx2 schedule
reduced efficacy in both the RL and HS-Sultan models. These
results show that the activity of PR-171 is dose and schedule
dependent. Both bortezomib and salinosporamide A are efficacious
in other xenograft models, including multiple myeloma models
(20, 21, 33, 44), but neither has been tested with a weekly QDx2
dosing schedule.
At the doses used in our efficacy studies, both PR-171 and
bortezomib suppressed proteasome activity in blood and adrenals
to an equivalent extent (Fig. 4D). This suggests that the improved
antitumor activity of PR-171 delivered on the weekly QDx2
schedule (relative to biweekly day 1/day 4 dosing of either PR171 or bortezomib) may be due to suppression of proteasome
activity recovery between doses. Antitumor efficacy was achieved
with PR-171 despite the fact that proteasome activity was inhibited

blood at 1- and 24-h time points. For whole
blood, chymotrypsin-like activity was also
measured 72 h and 7 d following drug
administration. Columns, mean activity

in HS-Sultan tumors to a lesser extent than other tissues (Fig. 4D).
Similar observations of low tumor proteasome inhibition have been
reported with both bortezomib (33, 44) and salinosporamide A (42).
This raises the possibility that mechanisms other than direct

cytotoxicity to the tumor cells may contribute to antitumor
efficacy. One such mechanism could be an antiangiogenic activity,
as has been observed with bortezomib (13). Alternative explanations for the low tumor pharmacodynamic response at efficacious

doses include enhanced sensitivity of the tumor cells in vivo to
proteasome inhibition or high local proteasome inhibition within
critical subdomains of the tumor (due to heterogeneous penetration by the drug; ref. 45).
Taken together, the results described in the present study show that
the novel proteasome inhibitor PR-171 has several in vitro and in vivo
properties that distinguish it from bortezomib and salinosporamide A.
Most importantly, PR-171 can be delivered with intensive daily dosing
schedules that inhibit proteasome activity by >80% in most tissues
without excessive toxicity. Furthermore, our xenograft studies show
that more intensive dosing schedules can yield greater efficacy in both
solid and hematologic tumor models. Supported by the preclinical
