BACKGROUND. The management of recurrent or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma
(HL) remains challenging. The objective of this phase 2 trial was to investigate
the activity of gemcitabine in combination with rituximab in patients with recurring or refractory HL.
METHODS. Patients were considered eligible if they had recurring or refractory

HL, had received 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, had an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2, and had adequate organ function. Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 intravenously every
week for 6 weeks. Gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1250 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8, with a week of rest on Day 15 of 21-day cycles in outpatient settings. Response was assessed after 2 cycles of gemcitabine, and those

patients who demonstrated a response continued to receive a maximum of 4
additional courses of gemcitabine.

RESULTS. Thirty-three patients received the study drugs. The median age of
patients was 32 years (range, 19–81 years), and 55% of the patients previously
underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. Grade 3 or 4 (graded according
to the National Cancer Center Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0])
toxic effects included neutropenia (36%) and thrombocytopenia (15%). Objective
responses occurred in 16 patients (48%). Responses were observed regardless of
CD20 positivity in tumor cells. The median duration of failure-free survival was
2.7 months (range, 0.9–18.3 months). Seven patients (21%) eventually proceeded
to either autologous (n 5 2) or allogeneic (n 5 5) stem cell transplantation.

CONCLUSIONS. Combination therapy with gemcitabine and rituximab is active in
previously treated patients with recurrent or refractory HL. The favorable safety
profile and the ease of its administration in outpatient settings warrant investigating it further in combination with other active drugs. Cancer 2008;112:831–6.

A

lthough Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is 1 of the most curable
human malignancies, the management of refractory and recurrent disease remains challenging. To our knowledge, with the exception of high-dose therapy followed by stem cell transplantation,
there is no curative treatment for patients with recurring disease.
New innovative treatment strategies are clearly needed.
The malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of HL
express several receptors that belong to the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) receptor family,1 including CD402 and CD30,3 and exogenous
soluble CD40 ligand (CD154, CD40L) and CD30L (CD153) can
enhance the survival of RS-derived cell lines in vitro. Both CD40L

and CD30L are expressed as transmembrane cell surface proteins on activated T and B cells in patients
with HL.4 In fact, B cells comprise 10% to 70% of the
total cellular component of affected lymph nodes by
HL, which may contribute to the survival of HRS cells
by providing CD30L and CD40L.4–6 Therefore, elimination of B cells from HL lymph nodes by rituximab,
an anti-CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody, may
deprive HRS cells from important survival signals and
lead to their death. Using this hypothesis, the activity
of rituximab in HL has been previously studied, in
which among 22 eligible patients, 5 (22%) achieved a
partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) that
lasted for a median of 7.8 months (range, 3.3–
14.9 months).7 The response was observed regardless
of the CD20 expression status in HRS cells.
Single-agent gemcitabine has demonstrated clinical activity in patients with recurring HL. Santoro
et al.8 recently treated 22 evaluable patients with
recurring HL with gemcitabine at doses of 1250 to
1500 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1, 8, and 15 of
28-day cycles. The overall response rate was 39%
including a CR in 9%. The median duration of
response was 6.7 months (range, 2–331 months).
With the hypothesis that B cell depletion may
enhance the activity of gemcitabine in HL, we performed the current phase 2 study to evaluate the
safety and efficacy of gemcitabine in combination
with rituximab in patients with recurring or refractory HL of the classic type.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
To be eligible for this study, patients were required to
have histologically confirmed recurrent or refractory
classic HL, with a minimum of 2 prior treatment
regimens. Patients were required to have bidimensionally measurable diseases; an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2;
and adequate bone marrow function (white blood
count 3.0 3 109/L, an absolute neutrophil count
[ANC] 1.5 3 109/L, an absolute lymphocyte count
1.0 3 109/L, a platelet count 100 3 109/L, and no
macroscopic evidence of circulating lymphoma
cells), hepatic function (total bilirubin level 2 times
the upper limit or normal; aspartate transaminase
and alanine transaminase levels 3 times the upper
limit of normal), and renal function (serum creatinine level 2 mg/L).
Patients were excluded if they were pregnant,
lactating, had human immunodeficiency virus
infection, had a history of central nervous system
involvement of lymphoma, had previously received
gemcitabine, or had uncontrolled intercurrent ill-

nesses. The trial was performed at the University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board.
All patients provided written informed consent to
participate in the study consistent with all federal,
state, and local requirements before study entry.

Treatment Schedule
Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2
intravenously every week for 6 consecutive weeks in
an outpatient setting. Gemcitabine was administered
on Day 1 at a dose of 1250 mg/m,2 intravenously on
Days 1 and 8, with a week of rest on Day 15 of
21-day cycles. After 2 cycles of gemcitabine, the clinical response was assessed as defined by the International Working Group Criteria published in 1999.9
Patients who achieved a CR, CR unconfirmed (CRu),
or PR continued to receive a maximum of 4 additional courses of gemcitabine. No dose modification
was planned for rituximab. For gemcitabine, if the
ANC was 1000 on Day 1 of the next cycle, the
gemcitabine infusion was delayed until the count
recovered. Prophylactic growth factors (granulocyte–
colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor) were administered
according to American Society of Clinical Oncology
guidelines. If the ANC remained at 1000 for 1 week,
then the gemcitabine dose was reduced by 1 level for
the next cycle. If the platelet count was 50,000 on
Day 1 of the next cycle, gemcitabine infusion was
delayed with until count recovery and the gemcitabine
dose for the next cycle was reduced by 1 level. Dose
levels 0, 21, and 22 of gemcitabine were 1250 mg/m2,
1000 mg/m2, and 750 mg/m2, respectively.
Toxicity and Response Assessments
Toxic effects were graded according to the National
Cancer Center Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 2.0). To assess response, patients were evaluated after the first 2 cycles of treatment with a physical examination as well as a thoracic, abdominal,
and pelvic computed tomography scan. Restaging
was required every 2 cycles thereafter until the
patient went off trial or the completion of the study.
The International Working Group Criteria9 were used
for the definition of responses. If patients achieved a
CR, CRu, or PR they remained on trial and continued
to receive gemcitabine treatment. Patients who had
stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) were
taken off the study.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of this study was an overall
response rate. The secondary endpoints were failure-

free survival (FFS), response duration, and toxicities.
The study used a MiniMax 2-stage design, in which
18 patients were recruited in the first stage. If 5
responses were observed in the first stage, an additional 15 patients were recruited in the second stage.
The 2-stage design was based on an a of 0.05, power
of 0.8, an undesirable response rate of 20%, and a
desirable response rate of 40%. Statistical analysis for
patient characteristics, response rates (CR, CRu, and
PR), and adverse events were descriptive. The FFS
duration was calculated from the time of registration
to the date of initiation of any other treatment or
death, whereas the response duration was calculated
from the time of the first documented response to
the time of disease progression. Those patients who
proceeded to high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell
transplantation without disease progression after the
current study were censored on the day of initiation
of conditioning regimen for calculation of both FFS
and response duration. The FFS and response durations were computed using the Kaplan-Meier
method.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Thirty-four patients with recurrent or refractory classic HL were registered in this study between March
2002 and August 2005. One patient, however, was
found not to have met the eligibility criteria (had
previously received gemcitabine) and did not receive
the study drugs. The characteristics of the remaining
33 patients, who did receive study drugs, are summarized in Table 1. The median age of the patients
was 32 years (range, 19–81 years), and 9% of patients
were age >60 years. All patients had classic HL,
which were previously treated with 2 of regimens
including local radiation therapy (n 5 18; 55%), platinum-containing chemotherapeutic regimens (n 5 24;
72%), rituximab-containing regimens (n 5 5; rituximab plus ABVD [doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine,
and dacarbazine] in 1 patient and single-agent rituximab in 4 patients), and autologous stem cell transplantation (n 5 18; 55%). The median number of
previous regimens was 3 (range, 2–7 previous regimens). Greater than half of the patients (n 5 18;
55%) had resistant disease to the last therapy (PD or
SD). Biopsy samples of the tumors demonstrated
mixed cellularity histology in 2 cases and nodular
sclerosing histology in 29 cases, and 2 cases had
classic HL not further classified due to extensive necrosis. On immunohistochemistry, CD20 was positive
on tumor cells in 5 cases (15%), negative in 27 cases,
and not assessable in 1 case.

Toxicity
A total of 33 patients received at least 1 infusion of
gemcitabine and rituximab and were assessable for
toxicity. Thirty patients completed 2 cycles of the
regimen. Three patients did not complete 2 cycles
due to intercurrent illness (1 patient), grade 3 myalgia (1 patient), and rapid disease progression (1
patient). The median number of cycles administered
per patient was 2 (range, 1–6 cycles).
The toxicities observed are summarized in Table 2.
The most common toxicities were hematologic.
Grade 3 or 4 toxicities observed during the study included hyperbilirubinemia (1 patient), elevated transaminase (1 patient), myalgia (1 patient), dyspnea (1
patient), neutropenia (12 patients), thrombocytopenia (5 patients), anemia (4 patients), and coagulopathy (1 patient). Thirteen patients required dose delay
due to grade 3 of 4 toxicities or active infection. Six
patients required level 21 dose reduction of gemcitabine due to cytopenia, and 2 required level 22 dose
reduction for further courses of therapy.
Responses
All 33 patients who received study drugs were
assessed for treatment responses. A response was

observed in 16 patients (48%; 95% confidence interval, 31–66%) including CR or CRu in 5 patients (15%)
and PR in 11 patients (33%). Responses were
observed both in patients who had previously undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (11 of 18
patients; 61%) and in those who did not (5 of 15
patients; 33%), and both in patients who had
received 3 regimens before the study entry (8 of 19
patients; 42%), and in those who had received 4
regimens (8 of 14 patients; 57%). Furthermore,
responses were observed both in patients with CD20positive HL (2 of 5 patients; 40%) and those with
CD20-negative HL (14 of 27 patients; 52%).
The median duration of FFS in 33 patients was
2.7 months (range, 0.9–18.3 months) (Fig. 1). The duration of FFS was similar in patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation and those
who did not (log-rank test, P 5 .78), with median of
3.6 months and 2.3 months, respectively. In those
who had a response to the therapy, the median duration of the response was 3.7 months (range, 0.4–16.9
months). Seven responders (21%) proceeded to highdose chemotherapy followed by autologous (n 5 2)
or allogeneic (n 5 5) stem cell transplantation.

In the current study, gemcitabine in combination
with rituximab produced an overall response rate of
48% in patients with recurring or refractory HL, confirming prior reports of gemcitabine activity in recurrent HL. This single-agent activity prompted several
investigators to combine gemcitabine with other
active regimens, with promising early results. Baetz
et al.10 reported a GDP regimen, consisting of gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 given intravenously
on Days 1 and 8, dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg
orally Days 1–4, and cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m2
on Day 1, every 21 days. In a total of 23 patients
with recurring or refractory HL who entered that
study, 4 (17%) achieved a CR and 12 (52%) achieved
a PR. No patient developed PD on this regimen and
all patients had successful stem cell mobilization and
underwent transplantation. Chau et al.11 evaluated a
similar regimen on a different schedule, consisting of
gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8,
and 15; methylprednisolone at a dose of 1000 mg on
Days 1 to 5; and cisplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on
Day 15 given every 28 days. In 10 patients with
recurring or refractory HL, 1 achieved a CR and 8
achieved a PR. Another combination regimen, GVD
(gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and liposomal doxorubicin), has been studied by the Cancer and Leukemia
Group B (CALGB).12 This regimen consisted of gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2, vinorelbine at a
dose of 20 mg/m2, and doxorubicin at a dose of
15 mg/m2 for transplant-naive patients, and gemcitabine at a dose of 800 mg/m2, vinorelbine at a dose of
15 mg/m2, and doxorubicin at a dose of 10 mg/m2
for posttransplantation patients, administered on
Days 1 and 8 every 21 days. In the 91 patients
enrolled, the CR and PR rates were 19% and

51%, respectively. The treatment was generally well
tolerated.
In the current study we combined gemcitabine
with rituximab. The original rationale of using rituximab in the current study was to deplete reactive
CD20-positive B cells from the microenvironment
surrounding HRS cells. The hypothesis was that these
reactive cells provide important survival and resistance factors to HRS cells, and that depleting these
reactive cells with rituximab may deprive HRS cells
from critical survival factors, thus making malignant
cells more sensitive to chemotherapy.4 The rationale
for using rituximab in patients with classic HL was
recently strengthened by the finding that HL stem
cells may express the CD20 antigen.13 Furthermore,
animal studies suggested that depleting normal B
cells from tumor-bearing mice enhance antitumor
immune responses to certain tumors by decreasing
interleukin-10 production from B cells.14 To test the
potential contribution of rituximab in the treatment
of patients with classic HL, we first examined its single-agent activity in 22 heavily pretreated patients.7
Rituximab was found to induce a 22% overall
response rate irrespective of CD20 expression on
HRS cells. Encouraged by these data, we then
designed 2 rituximab-based regimens: the first was
rituximab 1 ABVD in newly diagnosed patients15 and
the second was gemcitabine plus rituximab in
patients with recurrent disease, which is the subject
of the current report.
This study included heavily pretreated patients
and the majority of patients (55%) had recurrent disease after autologous stem cell transplantation.
Furthermore, gemcitabine was given only on Days 1
and 8 compared with other gemcitabine studies in
which the drugs were administered on Days 1, 8, and
15 of 28-day cycles. Thus, the 48% response rate
observed in this study compares favorably with other

single-agent gemcitabine studies that used more frequent doses in relatively less heavily pretreated
patients (Table 3).8,16,17 The median response duration in the current study was shorter than those in
other studies, which we believe is mostly due to the
finding that patients had been more heavily pretreated in the current study. Thus, the contribution
of rituximab to chemotherapy in patients with classic
HL can only be answered with certainty in randomized trials. In fact, based on our encouraging data
in the frontline setting, we are currently conducting
a randomized study comparing standard ABVD with
and without rituximab in newly diagnosed patients
who have poor risk features. Results from this prospective randomized trial will hopefully further clarify the role of rituximab in classic HL.
