BACKGROUND. Outcome of patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
remains unsatisfactory. Clofarabine is a nucleoside analog with activity in adult
AML. Combinations with cytarabine in AML are feasible and effective. Idarubicin
is another active AML drug, which has not yet been tested with clofarabine.

METHODS. The authors therefore designed a phase I study of clofarabine  cytarabine, plus idarubicin. Patients with primary refractory or first-relapse AML were
assigned to either clofarabine plus idarubicin (CI) if previously exposed to cytarabine with a response lasting <12 months, or clofarabine and idarubicin plus
cytarabine (CIA) for responses 12 months, or if never exposed to cytarabine. A
standard ‘‘3 1 3’’ phase 1 design was followed to define maximum tolerated dose
(MTD). Forty-four patients were treated (23 CI; 21 CIA).

RESULTS. Dose-limiting toxicities were hyperbilirubinemia and hepatic transaminase elevations for CI-treated patients in addition to mucositis and diarrhea for
CIA-treated patients. MTD for CI was clofarabine 22.5 mg/m2 intravenously daily
3 5 and idarubicin 10 mg/m2 intravenously daily 3 3. MTD for CIA was clofarabine 22.5 mg/m2 intravenously 3 5, idarubicin 6 mg/m2 intravenously 3 3, and
cytarabine 0.75 g/m2 intravenously 3 5 days.

CONCLUSIONS. A phase 2 randomized trial is in process to compare activity

ost patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse and
will require some form of salvage therapy. Whereas response to
salvage therapy depends on duration of a previous remission and
number of preceding salvage attempts, cure rates remain dismally
low, and only few patients enjoy long-term disease-free survival.
There is therefore a continued need to identify and test new agents
in clinical trials so that they can be incorporated into effective salvage regimens for patients.1-3
Clofarabine (2-chloro-20 -fluoro-deoxy-9-b-D-arabinofuranosyladenosine) is a second-generation nucleoside analog, which was
developed as a hybrid molecule to combine the most favorable
pharmacokinetic properties of both fludarabine and cladribine.4
Clofarabine acts as an inhibitor of both DNA synthesis and the
enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Its structural characteristics
render it resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase and
phosphorolytic cleavage by bacterial purine nucleoside phosphorylase.5-8 Clofarabine has been active against a broad range of human
tumor cell lines and human tumor xenograft models.9 A phase 1
trial in adult patients with leukemias and solid tumors showed a

16% response rate in acute leukemia patients.10 Activity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) led to approval by the Food and Drug Administration in December 2004 for the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALL who
have failed to respond to at least 2 prior regimens.11
The focus of clinical development of clofarabine in
adults has shifted to AML. In a phase 2 trial of single-agent clofarabine in relapsed and refractory acute
leukemias, response rates in 31 patients with AML
reached 55% (42% complete response [CR]) and were
reported to be as high as 87% for patients with first
remission durations lasting longer than 12 months.12
Encouraging results from the single-agent experience and preclinical data lending support to biochemical modulation between clofarabine and
intracellular cytarabine-50 -triphosphate (ara-CTP)
levels led to trials of clofarabine combinations with
cytarabine.13,14 Anthracyclines are active in AML
therapy and are the class of agents most commonly
combined with cytarabine. To investigate clofarabine
combinations in AML further, we designed 2 phase 1
trials of clofarabine with idarubicin and idarubicin
plus cytarabine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
Eligible were adults (age, 18 years) with 1) AML in
first relapse or with primary refractory disease, who
were receiving the study drugs as first salvage therapy; and 2) high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome
(10% marrow blasts) and not more than 1 prior
chemotherapy regimen. Patients could have received
additional therapy with biological or targeted therapies (eg, hypomethylating agents, tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, or monoclonal antibodies such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin). Additional eligibility criteria
included adequate hepatic (serum total bilirubin, 2
mg/dL; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase
[SGPT], 4 3 upper limit of normal), renal (serum
creatinine, 2 mg/dL), and cardiac (ejection fraction
>30% by echocardiography or gated cardiac scan)
function, and a performance status of at least 2
(Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group). Patients were
excluded if they had received previous treatment
with clofarabine, had symptomatic central nervous
system (CNS) involvement, or had an active uncontrolled systemic infection.
The study was approved by the institutional
review board (IRB) of the University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center and was conducted in accordance with the basic principles of the Declaration
of Helsinki.

Therapy
The study consisted of 2 phase 1 trials: clofarabine
plus idarubicin (CI), and clofarabine, idarubicin, plus
cytarabine (Ara-C) (CIA). For criteria for allocation to
treatment arm (CI vs CIA) see the section on ‘‘Statistical Methods.’’ The starting doses (cohort 1) of the
CI combination consisted of clofarabine 22.5 mg/m2
administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion daily
for 5 consecutive days (Days 1 to 5) plus idarubicin
12 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes daily for
3 consecutive days (Days 1 to 3). Starting doses for
CIA were as follows: clofarabine 22.5 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 2 to 6, idarubicin 8 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 to 3, and cytarabine 1 g/m2
intravenously over 2 hours on Days 1 to 5. Patients
could receive a maximum of 2 induction cycles or
treatment until a clinical response was documented.
Patients who did not achieve at least a partial
response after a second induction cycle were
removed from the study. All other patients were eligible to receive up to 4 consolidation cycles. Consolidation therapy consisted of the last induction
regimen at a 25% dose reduction for all drugs alternating with standard-dose cytarabine (100 mg/m2 as
a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours over
5 consecutive days). Cycles were repeated every 4 to
6 weeks as indicated by leukemia recurrence and hematopoietic recovery.
Supportive measures for optimal medical care
were provided throughout the study as determined
by the treating physicians and the patients’ medical
needs. Use of colony-stimulating factors was permitted, but not mandated. Prophylactic antibiotics,
antifungals, and antiviral agents (eg, levofloxacin,
itraconazole, valacyclovir) were recommended.
The pretreatment evaluation included history,
physical examination, complete blood counts (CBC)
with differential and platelet count, a complete
chemistry survey, and marrow aspiration with cytogenetic analysis. No marrow was requested if the diagnosis of relapse could be made unequivocally from
a peripheral blood specimen, including immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. An echocardiogram or
gated cardiac nuclear scan (‘‘MUGA’’) to evaluate the
left ventricular ejection fraction was performed
before therapy. Follow-up studies included CBC, differential, and platelet count at least weekly. Marrow
aspirations were repeated starting on Day 21 of therapy and then every 2 weeks until remission or nonresponse.
Response Criteria
A CR was defined as disappearance of all clinical
and/or radiologic evidence of disease with 5% marrow

blasts, neutrophil count 1 3 109/L, and platelet
count 100 3 109/L. A complete remission without
platelet recovery (CRp) had identical marrow results
and neutrophil recovery as for CR, but with platelets
<100 3 109/L and 20 3 10/L. Partial remission
consisted of a peripheral blood recovery as for CR,
but with a decrease in marrow blasts of 50% compared with baseline before therapy and not more
than 6% to 25% blasts in the marrow. All other
responses were considered failures.

Statistical Methods
The study consisted of 2 open-label phase 1 trials
with allocation to the respective treatment arm
depending on assumed responsiveness to cytarabine.
Patients who received a prior cytarabine-based
induction regimen and either were primary refractory
or experienced a CR of <12 months were assigned to
CI, whereas all others received CIA. However, if only
1 treatment arm was open for accrual, all eligible
patients could be accrued on that particular arm
irrespective of pretreatment characteristics. The primary objective of the study was to determine the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT) of the clofarabine salvage combinations. A standard 3 1 3 design was used to
determine cohort expansions and dose escalations.
All grade 3 drug-related, nonhematologic toxicities
that occurred within 14 days of the start of treatment
were considered DLTs with the exception of nausea
and vomiting (if manageable with supportive care
measures), alopecia, drug-related fevers, asymptomatic abnormalities of lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline
phosphatase, and disturbances of electrolytes, as
these are common events in patients with relapsed
leukemias.

RESULTS
Study Group
A total of 44 patients have been treated, 23 with CI
and 21 with CIA (Table 1). The median age of the CI
group was 58 years (range, 24 years-71 years). One
patient had refractory anemia with excess of blasts
(RAEB-2). Nine (39%) patients had primary refractory
disease (ie, lack of response to initial induction regimen, which in all cases except 1 [treatment with tipifarnib] indicated prior cytotoxic chemotherapy), and
14 (61%) were in their first relapse with a preceding
median first remission duration of 7 months (range,
1.9 months-9.3 months). Sixteen (70%) patients had
received at least intermediate doses (1 g/m2/day)
of cytarabine before, and 2 (9%) relapsed from an
allogeneic stem cell transplant. The remainder

CIA. All but 1 of these patients received prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

Determination of MTD, DLTs, and Toxicities
The process of dose escalations and occurrence of
DLTs by dose level for the CI group are detailed in
Table 2 and for the CIA group in Table 3. A summary
of all toxicities (including <grade 3) is provided in
Table 4. In general, skin rashes occurred more frequently with the 3-drug combination, as did grade
3 hyperbilirubinemia. Mucositis (<grade 3) was more
frequent with clofarabine plus idarubicin.
The first dose level in the CI group consisted of
clofarabine 22.5 mg/m2 intravenously daily 3 5 days
and idarubicin 12 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 3
days. The combination of the drugs at these doses
proved to be too toxic. One patient of the first cohort
of 3 developed grade 3 gastrointestinal-related
adverse events (diarrhea and mucositis). Another 2
patients in the expansion group developed grade 3
skin rash and diarrhea, respectively. The occurrence
of 3/6 patients with DLTs therefore required a reassessment of the study and redesign of the dose escalation plan. After IRB approval of the study
amendment, the new starting dose levels were clofar-

abine 15 mg/m2 daily 3 5 days and idarubicin 8 mg/
m2 daily 3 3 days. One patient developed grade 3
hyperbilirubinemia, but no further DLTs occurred in
the expanded group of 6 patients within the 14-day
observation period. No DLTs were observed in the
next 2 dose levels until 2 of 5 patients developed
grade 3 SGPT elevations, and grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia and headaches, respectively. The MTD and
recommended phase 2 doses are therefore the next
lower dose level of clofarabine 22.5 mg/m2 daily 3 5
days and idarubicin 10 mg/m2 daily 3 3 days.
A similar picture was seen in the 3-arm combination of CIA. The initial starting dose level of clofarabine 22.5 mg/m2 daily 3 5 days, idarubicin 8 mg/
m2 daily 3 3 days, and cytarabine 1 g/m2 daily 3 5
days had to be abandoned. One patient aged 78
years developed grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia between
Days 10 and 17 of therapy, with a maximum bilirubin
of 25.2 mg/dL. He died on Day 19 with signs of liver
failure and in acute anuric renal failure requiring
hemodialysis. Autopsy findings included nonbacterial
thrombotic endocarditis, acute tubular necrosis and
vascular thrombi in the kidneys, hepatomegaly with
cholestasis and vascular thrombi, pulmonary congestion with intra-alveolar hemorrhage and focal microthrombi, and no evidence of leukemia in a <5%
cellular marrow. Post autopsy cultures revealed CNS

developed bilirubinemia of up to 11.4 mg/dL
between Days 14 and 22 of therapy. He had ongoing
febrile episodes in the absence of positive cultures
requiring multiple changes in antibiotics. He died on
Day 34 of therapy after suffering bilateral intracerebral hemorrhages, which were considered unrelated
to therapy. The marrow was aplastic at the time of
death. The third patient of 29 years developed grade 3
hyperbilirubinemia starting on Day 7, which resolved
around Day 18 without any further adverse sequelae.
After amendment of the study, the dose levels could
be gradually re-escalated from clofarabine 15 mg/m2
daily 3 5, idarubicin 6 mg/m2 daily 3 3, and cytarabine 0.75 g/m2 daily 3 5 to a maximum of clofarabine
30 mg/m2 daily 3 5, idarubicin 6 mg/m2 daily 3 3,
and cytarabine 0.75 g/m2 daily 3 5. Two patients
experienced DLTs (skin rash/diarrhea and diarrhea/
hyperbilirubinemia, respectively) at the highest dose
levels, so that the MTD and recommended phase 2
doses are the next lower dose levels of clofarabine 22.5
mg/m2 daily 3 5, idarubicin 6 mg/m2 daily 3 3, and
cytarabine 0.75 g/m2 daily 3 5.
Myelosuppression was ubiquitous. Prolonged
myelosuppression (absolute neutrophil count [ANC]
<1 3 109/L and/or platelets <100 3 109/L for >42
days) of responding patients occurred in 3 patients
(13%) treated with clofarabine plus idarubicin. The
median time to CR in this group was 56 days (range,
53 days-58 days). Prolonged myelosuppression with
clofarabine, idarubicin, and cytarabine were observed
in only 1 patient (5%). The median time to CR for
CIA patients was 31 days (range, 24 days-67 days).

Response
Response rates and characteristics of responders are
summarized in Table 5. In the CI group, 3 (13%)

patients achieved CR and 2 (9%) achieved CRp,
which resulted in an overall response rate of 22%. All
responses occurred in patients with AML. Ten
patients (48%) achieved CR in the CIA group, which
included the only patient with a diagnosis of RAEB2. In either group, responses occurred after 1 course
of therapy, and were observed at all dose levels. Median response duration was 4.4 months (range, 2.3
months-8.11 months) for CI and 15.5 months (range,
3 months-27.81 months) for CIA responders. Thirty
percent of patients could be referred for a stem cell
transplant.

DISCUSSION
Clofarabine is a second-generation nucleoside analog
with activity in adult AML. As is a common treatment strategy in AML, experience with single-agent
activity quickly led to combination trials in an effort
to improve clinical efficacy. The first combinations
tested were with cytarabine. Cytarabine is 1 of the
most active antileukemic agents and forms the backbone of many combination regimens for patients
with AML. Furthermore, preclinical evidence suggested a biochemical interaction between the RNRinhibiting properties of clofarabine and the augmentation of intracellular levels of ara-CTP (‘‘biochemical
modulation’’).15,16 The theory was put to test in
clinical trials of clofarabine plus cytarabine in
patients with relapsed AML as well as in specifically
older patients with previously untreated AML. The
clinical experience is summarized in several original
articles and presentations.12-14,17-19 Whereas the contribution of biochemical modulation between clofarabine and cytarabine remains unclear, at least 1
study demonstrated a better response rate with the
combination.18 In this study, 70 patients aged 60
years with frontline AML were adaptively randomized
to low-dose clofarabine (30 mg/m2/dose) versus lowdose clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine (20 mg/m2
subcutaneously daily for 14 days during the induction). The randomization significantly favored the
combination arm, with a CR rate of 63% versus 31%
(P 5 .025), and more favorable event-free survival
(P 5 .04).
In this study, we tried to evaluate the feasibility
of further combining anthracyclines with clofarabine
 cytarabine. Anthracyclines are the most common
combination partner of cytarabine. Anthracycline activity results in DNA strand breaks, and the combination with nucleoside analogs may synergize with
anthracycline activity by inhibiting DNA repair
damage. Interactions of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2CdA, cladribine) with 3 anthracyclines (doxorubicin,

Clofarabine Salvage Therapy in AML/Faderl et al

idarubicin, and mitoxantrone) have been evaluated
on murine leukemias P388 and L1210.20 Combinations of all 3 anthracyclines potentiated the antileukemic activity of cladribine. In case of the
combination of 2-CdA plus idarubicin, an increase in
the life span of the leukemic mice of 60% was
observed, which was significantly higher than any
increase in life span gained on monotherapy schedules. With this background, and as idarubicin has
been the preferred anthracycline for induction and
salvage regimens of patients with AML in our institution, we chose idarubicin as part of the salvage combination program with clofarabine.
This has been the first study to combine idarubicin with clofarabine. DLTs were similar in both treatment groups and included hyperbilirubinemia,
elevation of transaminases, and headaches in the CI
group, and hyperbilirubinemia, diarrhea, and mucositis in the CIA group. The suggested phase 2 doses
for CI are clofarabine 22.5 mg/m2 daily 3 5 plus
idarubicin 10 mg/m2 daily 3 3, and for CIA clofarabine 22.5 mg/m2 daily 3 5, idarubicin 6 mg/m2 daily
3 3, and cytarabine 0.75 g/m2 daily 3 5. The idarubicin combinations proved difficult in the first cohort
of patients, where the dose levels in both treatment
groups proved too toxic. This was especially obvious
with the CIA combination, where the first 2 patients
died on study. These events raise an important issue,
which is not commonly addressed in phase 1 studies.
Phase 1 trials do not usually establish an MTD based
on age. It is very conceivable that DLTs may differ
between younger and older patients, and that a dose
that is effective and feasible in patients younger than
eg, 60 years, may prove too toxic in those who are
older than 70 years. In our example, both of the
patients in the first CIA cohort were 78 years old.
Although both of them had failed only biologically
targeted therapies before (tipifarnib in 1 case and
PTK787 in the other), they were not able to tolerate
intensive chemotherapy combinations. Although the
deaths may be attributed to causes not directly
related to the drug combinations (septic/infectious
complications in the first patient and cerebral hemorrhage in the second), the observed liver toxicities
are almost certainly drug-related. Fewer complications with less serious consequences occurred in
subsequent patient cohorts, who were in general
younger than 70 years, with 1 exception of a 76-yearold patient enrolled in the third dose level of CIA
and who did not experience grade 3 toxicities. In
general our study population is too small to enable
going beyond anecdotal evidence of a difference in
toxicities in patients older than 70 years. Only 2
patients exceeded 70 years in the CI group, and 6

2095

patients who received the 3-drug combination were
at least 70 years old. Comparing the incidence of
grade 3 toxicities in these patients with those of the
whole group (Table 4), we arrive at the following
results: CI, 1 patient with grade 3 skin rash (incidence 50% vs 9% overall); CIA, 1 patient with
diarrhea (17% vs 14%), 3 patients with hyperbilirubinemia (50% vs 33%), and 1 patient with an increase
in creatinine levels/acute renal failure (17% vs 5%).
A larger database of phase I studies would need
to be reviewed with regard to difference in toxicities
by age.
As patients were allocated to treatment combination based on pretreatment characteristics, notably
likelihood of response to cytarabine-containing regimens, it might be criticized that this allocation created patient groups with an inherently skewed
likelihood of developing toxicities. Patients who were
treated with CIA had on average longer first remission durations, which translated into longer treatment-free periods before salvage for some patients.
However, no such effect was evident in our study.
The toxicity profile was similar between the groups
with respect to both type and severity of adverse
events.
No conclusions can be drawn from the differences in response rates between CI and CIA.
Although CR rates of up to 48% in a phase 1 study
are encouraging, the study did not aim to establish
and far less to compare efficacy of the proposed
combinations. Differences in patient selection with
respect to presumed cytarabine responsiveness or
prior exposure to anthracyclines have to be considered when comparing responses between the treatment groups. To answer this question, we are
currently conducting an adaptively randomized 3arm study comparing CI and CIA with clofarabine
plus cytarabine as established in a previous trial.13
