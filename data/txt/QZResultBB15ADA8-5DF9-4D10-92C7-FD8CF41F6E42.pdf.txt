Taxol Resistance in Breast Cancer Cells Is Mediated by the
Hippo Pathway Component TAZ and Its Downstream
Transcriptional Targets Cyr61 and CTGF
Dulcie Lai, King Ching Ho, Yawei Hao, and Xiaolong Yang

Abstract
Taxol (paclitaxel) resistance represents a major challenge in breast cancer treatment. The TAZ (transcriptional
co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) oncogene is a major component of the novel Hippo–LATS signaling
pathway and a transcriptional coactivator that interacts with and activates multiple transcription factors to
regulate various biological processes. Here, we report that elevated levels of TAZ found in human breast cancer
cells are responsible for their resistance to Taxol. DNA microarray analysis identified the oncogenes Cyr61 and
CTGF as downstream transcriptional targets of TAZ. Short hairpin RNA–mediated knockdown of both Cyr61 and
CTGF reversed TAZ-induced Taxol resistance in breast cancer cells. Interaction of TAZ with the TEAD family of
transcription factors was essential for TAZ to activate the Cyr61/CTGF promoters and to induce Taxol resistance.
Our findings define the TAZ-TEAD-Cyr61/CTGF signaling pathway as an important modifier of the Taxol
response in breast cancer cells, as well as highlighting it as a novel therapeutic target to treat drug-resistant breast
cancers that arise commonly at advanced stages of disease. Cancer Res; 71(7); 2728–38. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and
second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women
worldwide (1). However, because of the multifactor and multistage nature of mammary tumorigenesis (2), the successful
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer remain a difficult
task for oncologists. One of the major obstacles for successful
breast cancer therapy is that, although mammary tumors can
sometimes be suppressed by therapeutic drugs, they often
recur and acquire resistance to therapy. Therefore, identification of proteins or biomarkers responsible for drug resistance
is critical for planning and designing alternative breast cancer
treatment strategies.
TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif)
is a WW domain–containing protein that functions as a
coactivator of many transcription factors that are critical
for the development of various tissues (3–7). Recently, TAZ
was identified as a component of the emerging Hippo–LATS
tumor suppressor pathway, which plays important roles in
regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis in both Drosophila

and mammals (8–10). The LATS tumor suppressor can phosphorylate and inhibit TAZ function in mammary cells (11). In
addition, TAZ is overexpressed in about 70% of breast cancer
cell lines and 20% of invasive breast cancer tissues (12).
Overexpression of TAZ has been shown to cause enhanced
cell proliferation and cell migration, transformation, and
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in immortalized
mammary epithelial cells (11, 12), suggesting that TAZ may
function as an oncogene in breast cancer. In this study, we
provided the first evidence that TAZ is also involved in drug
resistance in breast cancer.

Experimental Procedures
Plasmid construction and site-directed mutagenesis
The DNA of Cyr61 [nucleotide (nt) position 163 to þ57]
and CTGF (nt 250 to 1) promoters were amplified by PCR
from genomic DNA extracted from MCF10A mammary cells
(Supplementary Table 1S) and subsequently cloned into pGL3basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Site-directed
mutagenesis was done using the QuickChange Mutagenesis
Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacture's protocol.
Cell culture, transfection, and trypan blue exclusion
assay for cell death
The general methods for cell culture and cell transfection
are as described (13, 14). Human mammary epithelial cells
(HMEC) and Hs574-Mg mammary epithelial cells were
cultured in Mammary Epithelial Growth Media (MEGM; Clonetics). Trypan blue exclusion assay for Taxol (paclitaxel)induced cell death was done as described previously (15).

Cyr61/CTGF Mediate TAZ-induced Taxol Resistance

Antibodies, GST pull-down assay,
coimmunoprecipitation, and Western blot
Mouse monoclonal antibodies to FLAG and HA were M2
(Sigma) and 12C5 (Santa Cruz), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal
antibody to TAZ and mouse monoclonal antibody to E-cadherin were purchased from Cell Signaling and Transduction
Lab, respectively, whereas rabbit polyclonal antibody to Cyr61,
mouse monoclonal antibody to vimentin (V9), and goat
polyclonal antibody to CTGF were purchased from Santa
Cruz. Mammalian cell protein extraction, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP),
and Western blot are as described (13, 14).
Lentiviral production, infection, and establishment of
stable cell lines overexpressing or knocking down
cellular genes
Lentiviral production, titration, and infection are as
described (14). Two MDA-MB231 cell lines stably expressing
short hairpin RNAs [shRNA; shTAZ1: 50 -GCGATGAATCAGCCTCTGAAT-30 (sense); shTAZ2: 50 -GCCCTTTCTAACCTGGCTGTA-30 (sense); Open Biosystems] with the best TAZ
knockdown were established and subsequently used for
further experiments. Similar to TAZ knockdown, a set of
pGIPZ lentiviral vector expressing shRNAs against different
regions of Cyr61 or CTGF mRNAs (Open Biosystems) was also
used for screening of Cyr61 or CTGF knockdown in MCF10ATAZ cells. MCF10A-TAZ cells expressing shRNAs with the best
knockdown for Cyr61 [50 -GGCAGACCCTGTGAATATA-30
(sense)] or CTGF [50 -CCCAGACCCAACTATGATT-30 (sense)]
or Cyr61/CTGF were expanded and used for further experiments.
RNA isolation, microarray analysis, and qRT-PCR
RNA extraction, microarray, and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was done as described (14).
The RNAs were labeled, amplified, and used for the following
microarrays: array 1: WPI/Cy3-CTP, TAZ-1/Cy5-CTP; array 2:
TAZ-1/Cy3-CTP, WPI/Cy5-CTP (flip color); array 3: WPI/Cy3CTP, TAZ-2/Cy5-CTP (biological replicate).
Luciferase assay
Triplicates of 5  104 SK-BR3 cells in a 12-well plate were
transfected with Cyr61-luc or CTGF-luc or their mutants (0.1
mg) alone or together with TAZ (0.2 mg) or TAZ (0.2 mg) plus
TEAD (0.2 mg), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). As an
internal transfection control, 10 ng of Renilla luciferase vector
(pRL-TK) was also cotransfected in each sample. Luciferase
activity was measured 2 days after transfection, using the Dual
Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and the Turner
Biosystems 20/20 Luminometer.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
A ChIP-IT Express kit (active motif) was used for chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of TAZ and Cyr61 promoter interaction. In brief, MCF10A cells expressing WPI
vector or TAZ-HA were treated with 1% formaldehyde, lysed,
and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. DNA was
sheared by sonication and the sheared chromatin was incu-

bated with 2 mg of mouse IgG (Sigma) or anti-HA (F7)
monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed
by PCR by using the primers used for amplification of the
Cyr61 promoter. The PCR products were run on a 3% ethidium
bromide–agarose gel and visualized under UV.

Results
Levels of TAZ in mammary epithelial cells are
negatively correlated with their sensitivity to Taxol
To explore the roles of TAZ in drug resistance of breast
cancer cells, we first examined the level of TAZ in normal,
immortalized, and tumorigenic mammary cells representing
multistage tumorigenesis (Fig. 1A). Although TAZ levels were
low in both normal and immortalized mammary epithelial
cells, they were significantly higher in most of the breast
cancer cell lines examined (Fig. 1A). We subsequently examined the responses of 2 mammary cell lines MCF10A and
MDA-MB231, representing low and high TAZ levels, respectively, to increasing concentrations of Taxol, a chemotherapeutic drug commonly used for the treatment of breast cancer
and other cancers (16). Compared with TAZ-low MCF10A,
TAZ-high MDA-MB231 were significantly resistant to apoptosis induced by Taxol (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the higher
level of TAZ in mammary cells may be responsible for their
resistance to Taxol. To confirm that overexpression of TAZ is
directly responsible for Taxol resistance in mammary cancer
cells, we carried out the following 2 experiments. First, we
stably overexpressed TAZ in TAZ-low/drug-sensitive MCF10A
cells (Fig. 1A), using lentivirus expressing HA-tagged TAZ.
Significantly, compared with MCF10A-WPI control, overexpression of TAZ in MCF10A (MCF10A-TAZ) causes significant
resistance to apoptosis induced by Taxol (Fig. 1C). Second, we
knocked down TAZ in TAZ-high/drug-resistant MDA-MB231
by using lentiviruses expressing shRNAs against different
regions of TAZ mRNA (Fig. 1D). Significantly, knockdown
of TAZ by both shTAZs in MDA-MB231 cells sensitizes their
response to Taxol treatments (Fig. 1D). In summary, our
findings strongly suggest that TAZ is a novel biomarker for
the resistance of breast cancer cells to Taxol.
Identification of Cyr61 and CTGF as major downstream
targets of TAZ
To understand the molecular mechanism underlying TAZinduced drug resistance in mammary epithelial cells, we aimed
to identify the downstream targets of TAZ. Because TAZ is a
transcriptional coactivator (4), we used a whole human genome microarray to identify the transcriptional targets of TAZ.
HA-tagged TAZ was stably expressed in TAZ-low MCF10A cells
(Fig. 2A). Overexpression of TAZ in MCF10A causes EMT
(Fig. 2B) with reduced levels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin
and increased levels of the mesenchymal marker vimentin
(Fig. 2C). Gene expression profiles were subsequently compared between MCF10A-WPI and the 2 lines of MCF10A-TAZ
(Fig. 2A), using 44K whole human genome microarray analysis.
After statistical analysis, 389 cellular genes were transcriptionally activated after overexpression of TAZ (Supplementary
Table 2S). We further confirmed some of the transcriptional

and MDA-MB468) mammary cells. About 10 mg of cell lysate extracted from mammary cells by using lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1.0% NP40, and 1  protease inhibitor) were subjected to Western blot by using rabbit polyclonal anti-TAZ antibody (Cell Signaling).
b-Actin was used as an internal protein loading control. B, trypan blue exclusion analysis of apoptosis induced by Taxol in MCF10A and MDA-MB231
cells. About 2.5  104 cells were seeded into each well of 24-well plate, followed by treatment with increasing amounts of Taxol (0, 0.1, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100
nmol/L) for 72 hours. Because Taxol induces apoptotic cell death in breast cancer cells (16), the trypan blue exclusion assay is used for measuring apoptosis.
Dead cells were stained with 0.2% trypan blue, and the percentage of trypan blue–positive (dead) cells was calculated. Taxol concentrations are
shown in log10 scale. The mean and standard error of 3 independent experiments for each cell line are shown. C, overexpression of TAZ caused Taxol
resistance in MCF10A cells. Protein lysate extracted from MCF10A cells stably expressing WPI lentiviral vector or TAZ were subjected to Western blot by using
anti-TAZ antibody (top). Cell death assay (bottom) was done as described in (B). D, enhanced sensitivity of MDA-MB231 cells to Taxol after TAZ knockdown.
shRNAs against different regions of TAZ mRNA (shTAZ-1 and shTAZ-2) were stably expressed in MDA-MB231 cells. Duplicate protein lysate extracted
from MDA-MB231 cells stably expressing shTAZ were subjected to Western blotting by using anti-TAZ antibody (top). Protein lysate from MDA-MB231 cells
stably expressing shGFP was used as a nontargeting negative control. Procedures and conditions for cell death assay (bottom) are described as in (B).

Significantly, 8 cellular genes identified have higher levels of
mRNA after TAZ overexpression (Fig. 2D).
Next, we further characterized 2 of the most highly activated genes, Cyr61 and CTGF (Fig. 2D). Cyr61 and CTGF are 2
members of the connective tissue factor CCN (Cyr61, CTGF,

matrix proteins that function as ligands of the integrins to
regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration/adhesion,

and angiogenesis (17). Similar to TAZ, Cyr61 and CTGF have
previously been identified as oncogenes that are activated in
breast cancers and cause resistance to apoptosis induced by
Taxol or hypoxia when overexpressed in mammary epithelial
cells (18–28). Recently, CTGF has been identified as a transcriptional target of TAZ (29). However, the functional significance of its activation by TAZ is unknown. Moreover,
Cyr61 has not been identified as a transcriptional target of
TAZ. To confirm that both Cyr61 and CTGF are indeed bona
fide downstream targets of TAZ, we carried out the following
experiments. First, we used western blot analysis to show that

were carried out using a Dual Luciferase Assay Kit. The fold changes in luciferase activity were calculated by normalizing SK-BR3 cells transfected with Cyr61luc or CTGF-luc together with TAZ, TAZ-S89A, or TAZ-D227 to those transfected with Cyr61-luc or CTGF-luc alone.

Cyr61/CTGF Mediate TAZ-induced Taxol Resistance

TAZ overexpression, knockdown of TAZ by 2 shRNAs (shTAZ1 and shTAZ-2) reduced the expression of both Cyr61 and
CTGF in MDA-MB231 cells (Fig. 3B). Third, we found that TAZ
significantly activated the luciferase activity of both Cyr61 and
CTGF promoters (Cyr61-luc or CTGF-luc) 6.8- and 14.3-fold,
respectively (Fig. 3C and D). Cotransfection of a constitutively
active TAZ, TAZ-S89A (a mutant lacking LATS phosphorylation site), further enhanced Cyr61 and CTGF promoter activity
to 9- and 20.7-fold, respectively, whereas cotransfection of
TAZ-D227, a mutant lacking the transactivating domain,
abolished activation of the Cyr61 and CTGF promoters
(Fig. 3C and D), suggesting that the transactivating function
of TAZ is essential for its activation of Cyr61 and CTGF.
Finally, our ChIP assay showed that TAZ could be coimmunoprecipitated with the Cyr61 promoter DNA in vivo (Fig. 3E).
Collectively, these studies strongly suggest that Cyr61 and
CTGF are indeed bona fide transcriptional targets of TAZ.
TAZ activates Cyr61 through interaction with TEADs
Because TAZ is a transcriptional coactivator, it should
activate downstream genes through interaction with transcription factors. Recently, the TEAD family of proteins including TEAD1, 2, 3, and 4 (or TEADs) have been identified as the
transcription factors mediating TAZ functions in cell growth,
oncogenic transformation, and EMT (6, 29, 30). In addition,
TEADs have also been shown to enhance TAZ-induced transcriptional activation of CTGF (29). To examine whether
TEADs mediate TAZ-induced activation of Cyr61, we transfected Cyr61-luc alone, along with each of the TEADs, or with
both TAZ/TEADs into SK-BR3 cells. Although transfection of
any member of the TEAD family alone has no effect on Cyr61
promoter activity (data not shown), cotransfection of TEAD
with TAZ significantly enhanced TAZ-induced activation of
the Cyr61 promoter. On the other hand, cotransfection of
Runx2, another TAZ-interacting transcription factor, has no
effect (Fig. 4A), suggesting that TAZ may directly interact with
the TEADs to activate the Cyr61 promoter.
Next, we further examined whether the interaction of TEAD
with TAZ is essential for TAZ-induced transcriptional activation of the Cyr61 promoter. Because TEAD4 has been shown to
be the most important TEAD in TAZ-induced tumorigenesis
(29, 30), we chose to use TEAD4 in the following experiments.
First, our Co-IP assay clearly showed that, although TEAD4FLAG interacts strongly with TAZ-HA in vivo, a single amino
acid mutation in TEAD4, TEAD4-Y429H corresponding to
TEAD1-Y421H (31), abolished binding to TAZ (Fig. 4B). In
addition, the TEAD4-Y429H mutant also failed to enhance
TAZ-induced activation of the Cyr61 promoter (Fig. 4C),
suggesting that the interaction of TAZ with TEAD is critical
for its effect on activation of Cyr61 transcription.
Identification of the TEAD response element in the
Cyr61 promoter
Previous studies have shown that TEAD activates CTGF
through binding to 3 TEAD response elements (TREs) in the
CTGF promoter (32). Therefore, we wanted to determine
whether TAZ activates the Cyr61 promoter through TEAD
interaction with the TREs. We have also identified 2 putative

www.aacrjournals.org

TREs in the Cyr61 promoter region (Fig. 4D) and mutated the 2
TREs individually (TRE1M or TRE2M) or in combination (TRE1/
2M; Fig. 4E). Our luciferase assay showed that mutation of TRE1,
rather than TRE2, completely abolished TAZ/TEAD-induced
activation of the Cyr61 promoter (Fig. 4F), suggesting that TAZ/
TEAD may bind TRE1 to activate Cyr61 transcription.
TAZ and TEAD interaction is essential for its effects on
the Cyr61 and CTGF promoter and drug response in
mammary cells
Although TEADs have been identified as the critical transcription factors mediating TAZ-induced transformation, it is
still unknown whether TEADs are essential for TAZ-induced
drug resistance in breast cancer cells. To answer this question,
we carried out the following experiments. First, our GST pulldown assay showed that while equal amounts of fusion
protein were used (Ponceau S staining for proteins), wild-type
TAZ-GST rather than TAZD72-GST mutant [corresponding to
TAZ paralogue YAP mutant lacking interaction with TEADs
(33)] could interact with TEAD4-FLAG in vitro (Fig. 5A). In
addition, although overexpression of wild-type TAZ increased
the levels of Cyr61 and CTGF mRNA and protein, overexpression of TAZD72 had no effects (Fig. 5B and E). Moreover,
TAZD72 also failed to activate Cyr61 and CTGF promoter
activity (Fig. 5C and D) and its overexpression in MCF10A
failed to induce resistance to Taxol in these cells (Fig. 5F).
Knockdown of Cyr61 and CTGF reverses the drugresistant phenotypes caused by TAZ
Because enhanced levels of Cyr61 and CTGF have also been
shown to cause drug resistance in breast cancers (17, 23, 25,
34), we wanted to confirm that Cyr61 and CTGF are the major
downstream transcriptional targets mediating TAZ-induced
Taxol resistance. We produced lentiviruses expressing shRNA
against different regions of Cyr61 (shCyr61) or CTGF
(shCTGF) mRNA, which were used for single (TAZ/shCyr61
or TAZ/shCTGF) or double knockdown (TAZ/shCyr61/
shCTGF) in MCF10A-TAZ cells (Fig. 6A and B). As shown
in Figure 6C, whereas knockdown of Cyr61 or CTGF alone
partially, but significantly, sensitized MCF10A-TAZ cells to
Taxol, knockdown of both Cyr61 and CTGF completely blocks
TAZ-induced resistance to Taxol. Together, these results
strongly suggest that Cyr61 and CTGF are 2 of the major
downstream proteins mediating TAZ-induced Taxol resistance in breast cancer cells.

Discussion
TAZ as a novel gene inducing drug resistance
Although tremendous progress has been made toward
understanding the molecular mechanism underlying breast
cancer development and treatment, the overall survival of
breast cancer patients is still significantly hindered because
of the evolution of drug-resistant tumors. Therefore, the
identification of proteins responsible for drug resistance is
critical for successful breast cancer treatment. In this study,
we have for the first time identified TAZ as a novel
gene responsible for drug resistance in breast cancer. By

overexpressing TAZ in TAZ-low/drug-sensitive MCF10A
mammary epithelial cells, we have shown that enhanced
levels of TAZ can directly cause resistance of mammary
epithelial cells to apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic drug Taxol. On the other hand, knockdown of endogenous TAZ in TAZ-high/drug-resistant MDA-MB231 breast
cancer cells sensitized these cells to Taxol. We are currently
examining whether TAZ can be used as a biomarker in

in clinical setting by using tissue microarray samples
obtained from breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutic drugs such as Taxol. If TAZ levels are indeed
correlated with the drug resistance of breast cancer, targeting TAZ in TAZ-overexpressed, drug-resistant patients will
be a novel therapeutic strategy for successful breast cancer
treatment.

Recently, TAZ and its paralogue YAP have been identified as
2 major proteins mediating the effects of the novel Hippo–
LATS tumor suppressor pathway (10, 35). Consistent with our
finding that TAZ is a novel protein responsible for drug
resistance of breast cancer, some of the proteins in the
Hippo–LATS pathway have also been shown to be involved
in the drug resistance seen in human cancers. For example, we
have recently reported that loss of LATS1 and LATS2 tumor
suppressor genes, 2 negative regulators of TAZ (11), induced
resistance of cervical cancer cells to Taxol (15). On the other
hand, overexpression of YAP, a TAZ paralogue, also caused
resistance of breast cancer cells to multiple chemotherapeutic
drug treatments (36). In addition, loss of Mst or RASSF1A,
which are upstream activators of LATS, have also been shown
to cause drug resistance in prostate cancer and hepatocellular
carcinoma (37, 38). Altogether, these studies suggest that the

emerging Hippo–LATS tumor suppressor pathway, which has
been shown to play important roles in tumorigenesis, may also
have significant roles in drug resistance of human cancers.
Therefore, it will be very interesting to examine whether and
how TAZ and other components of the Hippo–LATS pathway
interact to induce drug resistance in breast cancer.
Identification of Cyr61 and CTGF as transcriptional
targets of TAZ
Although TAZ has been shown to be involved in regulating
various biological functions, the downstream transcriptional
targets mediating TAZ function remain largely unknown. By
using a 44K whole genome microarray and real-time qRT-PCR,
we have identified and confirmed many important cellular
genes as novel downstream transcriptional targets of TAZ.
Most interestingly, many of these genes including BMP4,

Cyr61, CTGF, FGF1, and PDGFb are growth factors secreted
from the cells to promote cell proliferation, cell migration/
adhesion, and tumorigenesis of mammary epithelial cells (17,
27, 39–42). Other TAZ downstream genes identified such as
IRS-1, MYLK/MLCK, and PLK2 are also important genes in
tumor development and metastasis (43, 44). Therefore, it will
be very interesting to examine whether these genes mediate
TAZ-induced functions in mammary cells.
In this study, we have characterized and confirmed Cyr61
and CTGF as 2 major bona fide transcriptional targets of TAZ
by the following experiments: First, we have shown that
overexpression of TAZ in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells
caused increased mRNA and protein levels of Cyr61 and CTGF.
Second, we have also shown that knockdown of TAZ in these
TAZ-overexpressing MCF10A reduced the increased Cyr61
and CTGF protein back to normal levels, whereas reduction
of endogenous TAZ by shTAZ in TAZ-high MDA-MB231
reduces Cyr61 and CTGF levels in these cells. Third, we have
shown that TAZ activates Cyr61 and CTGF transcription by
binding to and activating Cyr61 and CTGF promoters.
After confirming that Cyr61 and CTGF are indeed downstream transcriptional targets of TAZ, we then examined
whether Cyr61 and CTGF mediate TAZ-induced drug resistance in human mammary epithelial cells. Significantly, we
found that individual knockdown of Cyr61 or CTGF by shRNA
partially but double Cyr61/CTGF knockdown completely
reversed TAZ-induced Taxol resistance. These studies suggest
that Cyr61 and CTGF are 2 critical TAZ transcriptional targets
mediating TAZ-induced drug resistance in breast cancer cells.

Figure 7. A proposed model for
TAZ-induced drug resistance in
breast cancer cells. In this model,
TAZ and TEAD form a complex
which translocates to the nucleus
and binds to the TRE on the
promoter regions of Cyr61 or
CTGF that leads to their
transcriptional activation. After
proteolytic processing, Cyr61 and
CTGF are subsequently secreted
out of the cells and activate
integrin heterodimers on the cell
membrane, consequently
resulting in enhanced cell survival
and resistance to
chemotherapeutic drug-induced
apoptosis.

Cyr61/CTGF Mediate TAZ-induced Taxol Resistance

Together, our studies provided the first biological evidence
that overexpression of the TAZ oncogene can cause drug
resistance of breast cancer cells through direct activation of
2 secreted and matrix-associated proteins Cyr61 and CTGF.
Consistent with our findings, previous studies have also
shown that Cyr61 and CTGF are indeed oncogenes that caused
resistance of breast cancers to various chemotherapeutic
drugs (17, 23, 25, 34). Further studies also showed that both
Cyr61 and CTGF caused drug resistance by activating integrin
avb3 (Fig. 7), which subsequently activates both MAPK–ERK
and PI3K–Akt signaling pathways or by upregulation of the
antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and cIAP1/XIAP (23, 25, 34). We
have also found that overexpression of TAZ activated both
ERK and PI3K pathways (Lai and Yang, unpublished results).
Therefore, further characterization of how integrin and
MAPK/PI3K pathways mediate TAZ-induced drug resistance
will enhance our understanding of this signaling pathway in
mediating TAZ-induced drug resistance in breast cancer cells.
Identification of TEADs as transcription factors
mediating TAZ-induced drug resistance
In this study, we have identified the TEAD family of
transcription factors as the critical mediators of TAZ-induced
Cyr61 and CTGF transcriptional activation and drug resistance. The interaction between TAZ and TEAD is essential for
its effect on Cyr61 and CTGF transcription and TAZ-induced,
drug-resistant phenotypes. Although the roles of TEADs in
breast cancer has not been reported, TEAD1 and TEAD2 have
been shown to increase both cell proliferation and survival
(45) whereas TEAD4 was found to be the major TEAD
mediating TAZ-induced transformation (29, 30). However, it
remains unknown whether TEADs are also directly involved in
the response of breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drug
treatments. Therefore, further characterization of TEADs in

breast cancer development and drug response will be invaluable for our understanding of the roles of TAZ in mammary
tumorigenesis and drug resistance.
In conclusion, we have provided convincing evidence that
TAZ is a novel gene causing Taxol drug resistance through
activation of Cyr61 and CTGF in breast cancer cells as
illustrated in our proposed model (Fig. 7). Further confirmation of our findings using an in vivo mouse model and
clinical breast cancer patient samples will greatly facilitate
our efforts in the treatment of drug-resistant breast cancers
in the future.
