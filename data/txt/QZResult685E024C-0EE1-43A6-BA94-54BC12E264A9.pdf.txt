Abstract
Neuroblastoma arises from the sympathetic nervous system and accounts for
15% of childhood cancer mortality. Amplification of the oncogene N-Myc is reported
to occur in more than 20% of patients. While N-Myc amplification status strongly
correlates with higher tumour aggression and resistance to treatment, the role of
N-Myc in the aggressive progression of the disease is poorly understood. N-Myc
being a transcription factor can modulate the secretion of key proteins that may
play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. Characterising the soluble secreted proteins
or secretome will aid in understanding their role in the tumour microenvironment,
such as promoting cancer cell invasion and resistance to treatment. The aim of this
study is to characterise the secretome of human malignant neuroblastoma SK-NBE2 (N-Myc amplified, more aggressive) and SH-SY5Y (N-Myc non-amplified, less
aggressive) cells. Conditioned media from SK-N-BE2 and SH-SY5Y cell lines were
subjected to proteomics analysis. We report a catalogue of 894 proteins identified in
the secretome isolated from the two neuroblastoma cell lines, SK-N-BE2 and SH-SY5Y.
Functional enrichment analysis using FunRich software identified enhanced secretion
of proteins implicated in cysteine peptidase activity in the aggressive N-Myc amplified
SK-N-BE2 secretome compared to the less tumorigenic SH-SY5Y cells. Protein-protein
interaction-based network analysis highlighted the enrichment of cathepsin and
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition sub-networks. For the first time, inhibition of
cathepsins by inhibitors sensitized the resistant SK-N-BE2 cells to doxorubicin as
well as decreased its migratory potential. The dataset of secretome proteins of N-Myc
amplified (more aggressive) and non-amplified (less aggressive) neuroblastoma cells
represent the first inventory of neuroblastoma secretome. The study also highlights
the prominent role of cathepsins in the N-Myc amplified neuroblastoma pathogenesis.
As N-Myc amplification correlates with aggressive neuroblastoma and chemotherapybased treatment failure, co-treatment with cathepsin inhibitors might be a better
avenue for disease management.

talk between different cells within the tumour and its
surrounding supporting tissue or tumour stroma is pivotal
[2]. Stromal elements include the extracellular matrix
(ECM), as well as other cell types that are activated and/
or recruited to the tumour microenvironment such as
fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, and immune
cell infiltrates [3]. It is well established that many aspects
of cellular tumourigenicity are profoundly influenced by
reciprocal interactions between the responding normal
cells, their mediators, structural components of the ECM,
and genetically altered neoplastic cells [4-7].
Within the cellular microenvironment, secreted
proteins play a direct role in the regulation of both
physiological and pathophysiological processes [8-10].
These secreted proteins include growth factors, ECMdegrading enzymes, cell motility factors, angiogenic
factors and immunoregulatory cytokines participating in
various physiological processes such as immune defense
and cell signaling [11]. Such bioactive molecules also play
critical roles in pathological processes including cancer
cell differentiation, invasion, metastasis and sustained
angiogenesis by regulating cell-cell adhesion and ECM
interactions [12]. Furthermore, proteins secreted by cancer
cells into the tumour microenvironment (referred to as
cancer secretome) can subsequently enter bodily fluids,
such as blood and urine, and can be exploited as disease
biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes [13].
Hence, a detailed characterisation of secreted proteins
and their critical role in cell physiology and signalling
pathways may increase understanding of the disease and
facilitate development of improved therapies.
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial
solid tumor in childhood [14]. Despite aggressive
treatment strategies, the prognosis of patients with
disseminated neuroblastoma is grim, with a 5-year
survival rate of approximately 30%. The disease initiates
from primitive neuroepithelial cells of the embryonic
neural crest that develop into tumours within the
sympathetic nervous system [14]. Amplification of the
oncogene N-Myc is detected in approximately 20% of
patients, and >10 copies is strongly correlated with higher
tumour aggression and resistance to treatment. Notably,
the presence of the N-Myc oncogene is generally an
indicator for high-risk due to treatment resistance [15].
While the degree of malignancy, prognosis and resistance
to therapy is associated with the amplification of N-Myc,
its expression levels correlate with tumour growth and
invasiveness [16, 17]. By regulating gene expression
through its activity as a transcription factor, N-Myc
plays a key role in signalling cascades involved in cell
proliferation such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR or MAPK/ERK
[18]. Moreover, N-Myc amplification has been associated
with increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) thereby promoting angiogenesis in neuroblastoma
[19].
To date, very little is known about the soluble

Results and discussion
Proteomics analysis of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE2
cell line secretome
Quantitative PCR (Figure 1A) and Western blot
analysis (Figure 1B) of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE2 cells
confirmed the overexpression of N-Myc in SK-N-BE2
cells. To identify the secreted proteins, a proteomic
analysis was performed on the secretome of N-Myc
amplified (SK-N-BE2) and non-amplified (SH-SY5Y)
neuroblastoma cells. Cells were grown in serum-free
media for 24 h and the conditioned media was collected,
concentrated, and subjected to in-gel digestion and mass
spectrometry-based label free quantitative proteomic
analysis. Trypan blue-based cell death assay revealed
more than 8.5% and 7.8% cell death in SH-SY5Y and
SK-N-BE2 cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Overall, 894
secreted proteins were detected (Supplementary Table 1).
Among these, 328 and 179 proteins were unique to the
SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE2 secretome, respectively (Figure
1C). A total of 387 proteins were common between the
cells, among which 49 and 90 proteins were of higher and
lower abundance, respectively, in SK-N-BE2 compared
to SH-SY5Y. In order to identify proteins that are
overrepresented in any functional class, the dysregulated
proteins were subjected to functional enrichment analysis
using FunRich software (Figure 1D-H). According to the
molecular functions, proteins more abundant in the N-Myc
amplified SK-N-BE2 secretome were enriched (compared
to non-N-Myc amplified SH-SY5Y) in cell adhesion (9.6fold), cysteine-type peptidase activity (6-fold), serinetype peptidase activity (8-fold), galactosyltransferase
activity (7.4-fold), ECM structural constituent (6.6-fold)
and receptor binding (7.4-fold) (Figure 1D). By contrast,
proteins identified in SK-N-BE2 secretome were depleted
of RNA and DNA binding proteins (7.9- and 6.1-fold,
respectively), ubiquitin specific protease activity (10fold), and transporter activity (2.7-fold). The increase
in cell death (~1%) in SH-SY5Y cells could have also
contributed to the identification of DNA/RNA binding
proteins in the secretome of SH-SY5Y cells.
Further to this, 14% of proteins more abundant in
SK-N-BE2 secretome were categorised as extracellular

SK-N-BE2 and SH-SY5Y secretome are enriched
in neuroblastoma biomarkers

(Figure 1E). More than 17.8% of the proteins were
identified in exosomes, a class of extracellular vesicles
[20]. Among the pathways, integrin family cell surface
interactions, beta1 integrin cell surface interactions,
L1CAM interactions, TRAIL signaling pathway, C-Myc
pathway and Aplha6 beta4 integrin-ligand interactions
were significantly overrepresented in proteins more
abundant in the SK-N-BE2 secretome (Figure 1F).
Proteins implicated in ECM structure, catalysis,
hydrolysis and serine peptidase activity were significantly
overrepresented in SK-N-BE2 secretome (Figure 1G).
Extracellular matrix components biglycan (BGN) and
Collagen, type VI, alpha 1II (COL6A3) were uniquely
found in SK-N-BE2 secretome. Other ECM components
that were highly abundant and unique to SK-N-BE2
secretome include collagens and proteoglycans such as
COL6A2 (26-fold), HSPG2 (22-fold), COL14A1 (11fold), LUM (9-fold), DCN (7-fold), COL21A1 (5-fold).
In the context of biological processes, proteins involved
in energy pathways, metabolism, cell growth and/or
maintenance and cell communication were enriched in
SK-N-BE2 secretome (Figure 1H).
When only the proteins common to both secretomes
were analysed, extracellular matrix constituents and
cell adhesion molecules were overrepresented. The
extracellular matrix is not a passive structure which solely
acts as a scaffold for the movement of neural crest cells.
Rather, it provides an active input for cell migration from
the neural tube. In this matrix, fibronectin, laminins, and
proteoglycans regulate cell movement [21]. Proteins
involved in laminin-10/11 complexes were also among
the enriched proteins in SK-N-BE2 secretome (LAMC1
by 6-fold and LAMA5 by 3-fold). It is established that
Laminin 10/11 complex is involved in neoplasia by
promoting proliferation and migration [22]. The higher
abundance of proteins that facilitate cell proliferation,
migration and invasion in SK-N-BE2 secretome highlights
the role of these proteins in the aggressiveness and
invasiveness of the N-Myc amplified neuroblastoma cells.
There were 28 proteins, mostly ECM constituents
(i.e. BGN, COL6A3, COL6A2, HSPG2 and THBS2),
that showed more than 15-fold increase (arbitrary cutoff) in SK-N-BE2 secretome compared to SH-SY5Y.
The transmembrane glycoprotein teneurin-4 (ODZ4),
which is a highly expressed cellular signal transducer in
neurons, was the one of the most highly abundant proteins
in SK-N-BE2 secretome. ODZ4 is a positive regulator of
myelination in the CNS and promotes activation of focal
adhesion kinase. Interestingly, among the 28 proteins,
there were several cathepsin family members.

In addition to providing functional clues on
neuroblastoma pathogenicity, the secretome protein
fraction may also contain potential biomarkers
which could be exploited as indicators of the disease
condition. Both SK-N-BE2 and SH-SY5Y secretome
contained proteins that were previously implicated in
neuroblastoma pathogenesis. Granin family members
such as secretogranin II (SgII), chromogranin B (SgI)
and VGF nerve growth factor inducible (VGF) are known
biomarkers of neuroblastoma [23]. Even though VGF and
SgI were common to both secretomes, they were enriched
by 50- and 6-fold, respectively, in SK-N-BE2 cells. SgII
was exclusively identified in SK-N-BE2 secretome (141fold). The observation is consistent with previous findings
that reported high SgII expression levels in SK-N-BE2
cells compared to SH-SY5Y [24]. In addition, SgII has
also been suggested as a marker of human neuroblastoma
cell differentiation [25]. L1 cell adhesion molecule
(L1CAM) was the fourth most abundant protein in SKN-BE2 (72-fold highly abundant compared to SH-SY5Y)
and is known to be an indicator for developing neuronal
cells in more mature stages of neuroblastoma [26]. The
motility, angiogenesis and metastasis-stimulating factor
Autotaxin (ENPP2) [27], was 65-fold enriched in SKN-BE2. Similarly, dopa decarboxylase (DDC) was 28fold highly abundant in SK-N-BE2. High expression of
DDC both in blood and marrow corresponds to metastatic
neuroblastoma at diagnosis, residual disease, and poor
outcome [28].

EMT markers are enriched in SK-N-BE2
secretome
Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)
is a mechanism by which cells lose their epithelial
characteristics and acquire more migratory mesenchymal
properties [29]. EMT is an important mechanism for
both the initiation of tumour invasion and subsequent
metastasis of neuroblastoma [30]. Proteomic analysis
highlighted the abundance of EMT markers such as
Vimentin and SPARC (33- and 14-fold, respectively)
in the more aggressive SK-N-BE2 neuroblastoma cellderived secretome. Similarly, N-Cadherin was 3-fold
more abundant in SK-N-BE2 secretome. In addition,
proteins attributed to the mesenchymal transition signature
(THBS2 (21-fold), BGN (312-fold), LGALS1 (5-fold),
LUM (8-fold), SERPINF1 (12-fold)) were also more
abundant in SK-N-BE2 secretome [31]. MMP2 was a
common mesenchymal transition signature protein that
was present in almost equal amounts in both secretomes.
MMP2 is an important protein in the degradation of
various extracellular matrix molecules, including collagen

type I, IV, V, VII, X, and XI, as well as elastin, gelatins
and laminin [32]. To further validate the EMT phenotype,
qPCR analysis was performed for EMT regulators Snail,
Slug, Twist and ZEB-1. As shown in Figure 2A, Twist
was 8.5-fold upregulated in SK-N-BE2 cells compared
to SH-SY5Y. Similarly, ZEB-1 was 2-fold upregulated
in SK-N-BE2 cells correlating with the EMT phenotype.
However, Slug did not show any significant difference
in the abundance among the two neuroblastoma cells. In
addition, Snail was significantly downregulated in SK-NBE2 cells. These observations clearly highlight that EMT
may also contribute to neuroblastoma aggressiveness.

and neuron projections, axon extension, axis elongation,
extracellular matrix disassembly and glycosaminoglycan
metabolism. Further, the protein-protein interaction
network analysis of these highly abundant proteins depicts
the presence of highly clustered cathepsin modules as well
as other biological modules, which are known to play a
role in the developmental and metabolic process (Figure
2C).
Additionally, using Reactome Plugin in Cytoscape,
a protein interaction network analysis was performed with
the highly abundant proteins in the SK-N-BE2 secretome.
This analysis highlighted the enrichment of the cathepsin
protein network in SK-N-BE2 secretome (Figure 2D).
Proteases of the cathepsin family cleave amide bonds of
peptides and proteins. While cathepsins are predominantly
contained within lysosomes and are active at acidic pH,
they may also be associated with the plasma membrane
or secreted into the extracellular environment [37].
Cathepsins can be divided into three subgroups according
to their active-site amino acid; i.e. cysteine cathepsins (B,
C, H, F, K, L, O, S, V, W and Z/X), aspartic cathepsins
(D and E) or serine cathepsins (A, G). Among the 228
proteins with at least two-fold increase in SK-N-BE2
secretome, 6 were cathepsins, including CTSL1 (29-fold),
CTSD (27-fold), CTSB (20-fold), CTSC (9-fold), CTSA
(6-fold) and CTSL2 (3-fold).
Enhanced secretion of cathepsins in SK-N-BE2
secretome was further validated biochemically (Figure
3). Consistent with the proteomic data, Western blotting
confirmed the secretion of high amounts of pro-cathepsin
L by SK-N-BE2 cells (Figure 3A). Cathepsin B was also
present in its proform in both cell lines; however, SKN-BE2 cells secreted a lower molecular weight species,
which may be the result of increased autocatalytic
maturation or processing by another protease. To assess
levels of active cathepsins, the pH of the conditioned
media was lowered to 5.5 to allow for optimal activation
and an activity-based probe, BMV109, was added
followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorescence detection.
This assay revealed increased activity of cathepsin L
in the secretome of SK-N-BE2 compared to SH-SY5Y
cells (Figure 3B). Subsequent Western blotting revealed
processing of a small amount of cathepsin L to its active
form, which was not observed for cathepsin B. This data
suggests that within a tumour microenvironment in vivo,
where hypoxia and other factors are known to create an
acidic extracellular environment, SK-N-BE2 cells are
likely to secrete cathepsin L capable of proteolytic activity.
Furthermore, the activity and expression
of cathepsins in whole cell lysates from the two
neuroblastoma cells were also analysed (Figure 3C).
Expression of the proform of cathepsin B was relatively
similar between the two whole cell lysates; however, the
SK-N-BE2 line displayed two more mature cathepsin
B species, which correspond to the activated forms.
Expression levels of procathepsin L could not be detected

Several N-Myc targets are dysregulated in SK-NBE2 secretome
Overexpression of N-Myc in SK-N-SH
neuroblastoma cells lacking N-Myc resulted in the
marked increase of insulin like growth factor (IGF)-2,
IGF-1R and IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-2 suggesting
transcriptional regulation of these proteins by N-Myc [33].
Consistent with this finding, N-Myc amplified SK-N-BE2
cells secreted IGF-2 (5-fold) and IGFBP-2 (4-fold) in
higher abundance compared to SH-SY5Y cells. However,
IGF-1R was not detected in SK-N-BE2 secretomes,
though a 4-fold increase in shed IGF-2R domains in the
N-Myc amplified SK-N-BE2 secretome was observed.
It is well established that IGF stimulate proliferation
and differentiation in many cell types and are important
in the progression of neuroblastoma [33]. Additionally,
other known N-Myc targets such as Cathepsin D and
N-CAD [34, 35] were also highly abundant in SK-N-BE2
secretome.
Dihydropyrimidinase-like proteins (DPYSLs) are
a family of proteins developmentally regulated during
maturation of the nervous system. It has been previously
established that DPYSLs are negatively regulated by
N-Myc and reduced expression levels correlate with
poor clinical outcomes [36]. In accordance with this
observation, DPYSL1, 2, 4 and 5 were less abundant in
SK-N-BE2 secretome. DPYSL1, 2, 4 and 5 exhibited
3-, 4-, 12- and 10-fold less abundance in SK-N-BE2
secretome, respectively.

Cathepsins are enriched in N-Myc amplified SKN-BE2 cell-derived secretome
To gain functional insights and to depict the
biological modules in highly abundant SK-N-BE2
proteins, a functional interaction network analysis
approach using ClueGO cytoscape plugin was performed.
The functional networks (Figure 2B) depict the presence of
highly significant functional groups known to be involved
in many developmental and basic metabolic process like

in the whole cell lysates by Western as the expression
levels were below the threshold of detection. Activity of
cathepsins B and L, as assessed by BMV109 labelling,
was increased in SK-N-BE2 compared to SH-SY5Y
cells (Figure 3C). Cathepsin activity could be abolished
by treating the cells with the cysteine cathepsin inhibitor
JPM-OEt prior to adding BMV109 (Figure 3D). As
cathepsins are known to facilitate cancer progression
by protein degradation and ECM remodelling [38], the
higher abundance of active cathepsins in SK-N-BE2
secretome may contribute to cancer aggressiveness and
chemotherapeutic sensitivity in N-Myc amplified SK-NBE2 cells.

different readouts, it is not uncommon to obtain varying
results. On the contrast, consistent with FACS apoptosis
assay, a significant difference in cell proliferation and
metabolic flux was observed for SK-N-BE2 cells treated
with doxorubicin in the presence of cathepsin inhibitors
compared to doxorubicin treatment alone (Figure 4B).
The level of cell proliferation was almost the same for
more drug responsive SH-SY5Y both in the presence
and absence of cathepsin inhibitors with doxorubicin
treatment. These results confirm that cathepsin inhibition
could sensitize the aggressive N-Myc amplified
neuroblastoma cells to doxorubicin.

Cathepsins inhibition affect the migratory
properties of SK-N-BE2 cells more than SH-SY5Y

Cathepsins inhibition sensitizes neuroblastoma
cells to doxorubicin

In addition to chemosensitivity, the role of
cathepsins in cell migration was studied by wound
healing assay. Wound healing assays were performed by
making a uniform scratch on a monolayer of cells at 100%
confluence. The scratches were then observed at different
time points for closure of the wound gap (Figure 5). It was
observed that the wound closure rate was faster in N-Myc
amplified neuroblastoma cells confirming the aggressive
phenotype of the cells (Figure 5A). When wound healing
assay was performed with the presence of cathepsin
inhibitors, the migratory properties of SK-N-BE2 cells
were significantly attenuated in comparison to SH-SY5Y
cells (Figure 5B). The two cathepsin inhibitors reduced
the migration to a similar extent. These data suggest that
cathepsins indeed play a role in migration of the SK-NBE2 cells.
Overall, a total of 894 proteins were identified
in the secretome-based proteomics analysis of the
highly aggressive N-Myc amplified SK-N-BE2 and
less aggressive N-Myc non-amplified SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cells. A following bioinformatics analysis
of the secretome data showed multiple classes of proteins
that are overrepresented in SK-N-BE2 secretome.
Among these, the most significant findings include the
involvement of EMT and the enrichment of the protease
cathepsins. EMT results in the loss of polarity and the
gain of more invasive phenotype which is consistent with
the SK-N-BE2 cells. The mesenchymal attributes thereby
could be one of the main reasons for the aggressive nature
of SK-N-BE2 cells.
In addition to metastasis, recent evidences suggest
that EMT also regulates chemotherapeutic drug resistance
in a number of cancer types. Human colorectal cancer cell
lines KM12L4 and HT29 displayed EMT as a consequence
of oxiplatin resistance by translocating β-Catenin to the
nucleus [41]. Hepatocellular carcinoma cells resistant to
5-FU also showed induction of EMT with the upregulation
of Twist and the down regulation of E-Cadherin [42].
Similarly, activation of Snail in colorectal cancer cell

Chemotherapeutic resistance is the primary cause
of treatment failure in N-Myc amplified neuroblastoma
patients [16, 17]. It has been reported that cellular
cathepsin D play a role in regulating chemotherapeutic
drug resistance in N-Myc amplified Tet21N neuroblastoma
cells [35]. As cathepsins were highly abundant in the
secretome of N-Myc amplified neuroblastoma cells,
the role of cathepsins in regulating sensitivity to a
chemotherapeutic drug was studied. In order to do this,
N-Myc amplified SK-N-BE2 cells were co-treated with
doxorubicin and a cathepsin inhibitor. Two cathepsin
inhibitors namely JPM-OEt, a cysteine cathepsin
inhibitor [39] and antipain dihydrochloride, a reversible
cysteine, aspartic and serine cathepsin inhibitor [40],
were used in this analysis. FACS and MTS assays were
performed to monitor the cell death and proliferation upon
treatment with doxorubicin (Figure 4). Consistent with
previous reports, SK-N-BE2 cells were more resistant to
doxorubicin treatment compared to SH-SY5Y (Figure 4A)
[16, 17]. Cell death assay with propidium iodide uptake
and Annexin V staining was performed with the two
neuroblastoma cell lines treated with doxorubicin in the
presence and absence of cathepsin inhibition. SH-SY5Y
did not show a significant difference in the level of cell
death when co-treated with doxorubicin and antipain.
However, SK-N-BE2 cells exhibited higher levels of
apoptosis when co-treated with doxorubicin and antipain
or JPM (Figure 4A). Cysteine cathepsin inhibitor JPM cotreatment with doxorubicin induced more cell death in SKN-BE2 cells than antipain. Importantly, for the first time,
this data suggests that that cysteine cathepsins B, L and
C may protect the neuroblastoma cells from doxorubicin
induced cell death.
In addition, for unknown reasons, the cell viability
was higher in SH-SY5Y cells when co-treated with JPM
and doxorubicin compared to doxorubicin alone. However,
this trend was not visible in MTS based proliferation assay
(Figure 4B). As MTS and the FACS assays profile for two

lines led to increased motility and invasiveness with
increased resistance to 5-FU [43]. With the light of these
observations, it can be speculated that EMT may also
contribute to the inherent treatment resistance of SK-NBE2 cells.
The most significant findings of the study relate
to cathepsins. For the first time, the secretion of active
cathepsins by neuroblastoma cells is shown in this study.
It is well documented that cathepsins are upregulated
in a variety of cancers resulting in the secretion of both
inactive and active forms during cancer progression
[44]. Secreted cathepsins can function in proteolytic
pathways thereby increasing cancer aggressiveness. Mass
spectrometry-based proteomics analysis highlighted the
secretion of more than six cathepsins by SK-N-BE2 cells.
Most importantly, the detection of active cathepsins in the
secretome suggests the involvement of these proteases in
the tumor microenvironment and in turn in N-Myc-based
neuroblastoma aggressiveness. FACS and MTS based

assays confirmed the involvement of the cathepsins in
treatment resistance to doxorubicin. As N-Myc amplified
neuroblastoma is inherently resistant to doxorubicin,
cathepsin inhibition-based sensitization of N-Myc
amplified neuroblastoma cells provides unparalleled
opportunities to treat neuroblastoma patients effectively.

Conclusions
Secretome profiles of N-Myc amplified (SK-NBE2) and non-amplified (SH-SY5Y) neuroblastoma cells
were identified by high-resolution mass spectrometrybased label-free quantitative proteomics. Functional
enrichment analysis of identified proteins revealed
multiple attributes that are overrepresented in SK-NBE2 secretome. The protein-protein interaction-based
network analysis identified the enrichment of EMT
as well as the cathepsin sub-networks. Inhibition of

previously [45]. Briefly, the gel bands were subjected to
reduction by 10 mM DTT (Bio-Rad), alkylation by 25 mM
iodoacetamide (Sigma), tryptic digestion overnight with
150 ng of trypsin (Promega). Subsequently, the tryptic
peptides were further extracted using acetonitrile (50%
w/v) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%).

cathepsins increased the sensitivity of SK-N-BE2 cells
to doxorubicin and attenuated its migratory properties.
However non-amplified SH-SY5Y cell line remained
unaffected or mildly affected by cathepsin inhibition.
These data indicate the prominent role of cathepsins in the
N-Myc amplified neuroblastoma pathogenesis. As N-Myc
amplification correlates with aggressive neuroblastoma
and chemotherapy-based treatment failure, co-treatment
with cathepsin inhibitors will be a better avenue for
disease management.

LC-MS/MS
Extracted tryptic peptides from each gel band were
concentrated to ~10 μL by centrifugal lyophilisation and
analysed by LC-MS/MS using LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) fitted with nanoflow
reversed-phase-HPLC (Model 1200, Agilent). The nanoLC system was equipped with an Acclaim Pepmap nanotrap column (Dionex – C18, 100 Å, 75 μm × 2 cm) and an
Acclaim Pepmap RSLC analytical column (Dionex – C18,
100 Å, 75 μm × 15 cm). Typically for each LC-MS/MS
experiment, 1 μL of the peptide mix was loaded onto the
enrichment (trap) column at an isocratic flow of 3 μL/min
of 3% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid for 4 min
before the enrichment column is switched in-line with the
analytical column. The eluents used for the LC were 0.1%
v/v formic acid (solvent A) and 100% acetonitrile/0.1%
formic acid v/v. The gradient used was 3% B to 8% B
for 1 min, 8% B to 35% B in 30 min, 35% B to 85% B
in 5 min and maintained at 85% B for the final 5 min.
All spectra were acquired in positive mode with full scan
MS spectra scanning from m/z 300–2000 in the FT mode
at 30000 resolution after accumulating to a target value
of 1.00e6 with maximum accumulation of 500 ms. The
20 most intense peptide ions with charge states ≥2 were
isolated at a target value of 1000 and fragmented by low
energy CID with normalized collision energy of 30 and
activation Q of 0.25. Dynamic exclusion settings of 2
repeat counts over 30 s and exclusion duration of 70 s.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y and
SK-N-BE2 were gifted by Dr. Julie Atkins (Department
of Biochemistry, La Trobe University) and Dr. Loretta
Lau (Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney).
Both the cell lines were grown in DMEM (GIBCO, Life
Technologies) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)
and 100 Unit/mL of penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO,
Life Technologies). The cells were cultured in 5% CO2
atmosphere at 37ºC.

Preparation of conditioned media (CM)
For preparing CM, neuroblastoma cells were seeded
in 150 mm diameter culture dishes (10 dishes per cell line)
in the presence of 25 mL of culture medium. After cell
density reached 70-80% confluence, the cells were washed
twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The cells
were then cultured in 15 mL of DMEM supplemented
with 0.8% Insulin transferrin selenium (ITS) and 100
Unit/mL of penicillin-streptomycin for 24 h. The CM
was collected, centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min to remove
floating cells followed by another centrifugation step at
2,000 g for 20 min. The CM was then centrifuged for
1 h at 100,000 g to remove extracellular vesicles. The
CM was concentrated from 50 mL to ~1 mL using an
Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device with 3,000 Da
nominal molecular weight limit (Millipore) at 4,000 g. The
resulted concentrated CM was stored at -80ºC until further
analysis.

Database searching and protein identification
Peak lists were generated using extract-msn as
part of Bioworks 3.3.1 (Thermo Scientific) using the
following parameters: minimum mass 300; maximum
mass 5,000; grouping tolerance 0.01 Da; intermediate
scans 200; minimum group count 1; 10 peaks minimum
and total ion current of 100. Peak lists for each LC-MS/
MS run were merged into a single mascot generic format.
Automatic charge state recognition was used because of
the high resolution survey scan (30,000). LC-MS/MS
spectra were searched against the NCBI RefSeq database
[46] in a target decoy fashion using MASCOT (v2.4,
Matrix Science, U.K.). Search parameters used were:
fixed modification (carboamidomethylation of cysteine;
+57 Da), variable modifications (oxidation of methionine;
+16 Da), three missed tryptic cleavages, 20 ppm peptide
mass tolerance and 0.6 Da fragment ion mass tolerance.

In gel digestion
Concentrated CM (30 μg quantified by SYPRO
Ruby staining) was electrophoretically separated using
SDS-PAGE and proteins were visualized by staining
with Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain. Gel lanes were cut
into 20 x 2 mm bands using a scalpel blade and proteins
were reduced, alkylated and trypsinised as described

Peptide identifications with mascot ion score greater than

discovery rate was achieved.

for 15 sec using Agilent LC140 qPCR machine. The qPCR
results obtained (with the use of generated cDNA) were
normalized using the Ct values of human ubiquitin.

Functional enrichment and interaction network
analysis

Label-free spectral counting
The relative protein abundance between the samples
was obtained by estimating the ratio of normalized spectral
counts (RSc) as previously described [45].
RSc for protein A = [(sY+c) (TX-sX+c) / (sX+c)
(TY-sY+c)]
Where s is the significant MS/MS spectra for protein
A, T is the total number of significant MS/MS spectra in
the secretome sample, c is the correction factor set to 1.25,
and X and Y are the secretome samples. When RSc is less
than 1, the negative inverse RSc value was used.

The functional networks of identified proteins
was constructed using ClueGO v1.7.1 [47], a Cytoscape
v2.8.3 [48] plugin. Overrepresentation of Gene Ontology
biological process and pathway terms for N-Myc
amplified and non-amplified highly abundant proteins
were identified using the stand-alone enrichment analysis
tool FunRich. The protein-protein physical interactions
for the highly abundant N-Myc amplified genes were
collated from HPRD [49] and BioGRID [50] interaction
databases and the interaction networks were visualized
using Cytoscape v.2.8.3. The protein-protein interaction
networks were further separated into different clusters
and biological significance of these clusters were depicted
using clusterMaker v.1.8 and BiNGO v.2.44 cytoscape
plugins, respectively.

RNA isolation
RNA isolation was performed using TRI reagent®
RT (Molecular research, Inc). The cells were grown to
100% confluence and the medium was removed before
adding 1 mL of TRI reagent. Repetitive pipetting was
performed to obtain homogenized mixture of cells.
The cell lysate was then aliquoted along with 50 µL of
4-bromoanisole (BAN) solution (Molecular research, Inc)
and was subjected to vigorous mixing. To achieve phase
separation, samples were subjected to centrifugation at
12,000 g for 5 min at 4˚C. The top aqueous layer was
separated out and equal volume of isopropanol was
added. The mixture was then incubated for 10 min at room
temperature. RNA pellet was obtained by centrifugation
at 12,000 g for 5 min at 4˚C. Ethanol (75% (v/v)) was
used to wash the RNA pellet, which was then subjected
to centrifugation. The pellet obtained was resuspended in
Ambion® DEPC-treated water (Life technologies) and
stored at -20˚C.

Cathepsin analysis in the secretome and whole cell
lysates
SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE2 neuroblastoma cells
were seeded in equal density in 6-well plates. When cells
reached 80% confluency, 0.1 µM BMV109 pan cathepsin
activity-based probe [51] was added to the cell and
incubated for 1 h. Following incubation cells were washed
thrice with PBS. Cells were then harvested by scraping
and lysed for analysis. Lysis buffer consisted of 50 mM
citrate, pH 5.5, 0.5% CHAPS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 4
mM DTT. The lysates were quantified using BCA assay
and equal amount of sample (30 µg) was analysed on a
gel. For cathepsin analysis, 30 µg of total protein from
each secretome sample was taken and BMV109 probe (0.1
µM) was added to each sample and incubated at 37˚C for 1
h. At the end of the incubation, SDS sample loading buffer
was added to each sample and analysed on a gel. The Cy5
fluorescence of the probe was detected by scanning the
gels under the Typhoon Trio (GE Healthcare) scanner. The
gels was then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and
probed with antibodies against Cathepsin isoforms B and
L (R&D AF1515 and AF965 antibodies, respectively). The
specificity of the probe was tested by growing cells in the
presence of the cysteine cathepsin inhibitor JPM (100 µM)
for 24 h and then incubating with the probe.

cDNA synthesis and qPCR
iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) was used
in synthesizing cDNA, according to manufacturer’s
protocol. Total RNA (2 µg) was used in the cDNA
synthesis with 500 ng/uL as the final concentration of
the reaction. The concentrations of the generated cDNA
were measured using NanoDrop® ND-1000 (Thermo
scientific) spectrophotometer. According to manufacturer’s
instructions, quantitative PCR was carried out using
SensiMix™ SYBR Low-ROX kit (Bioline). For each
reaction, appropriate primers were used. Activation of
polymerase was carried out by heating the final qPCR
mixture at 95˚C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of
amplification at 95˚C for 15 sec, 52˚C for 15 sec and 72˚C

Equal numbers of cells were seeded in 24-well
plates (for cell death analysis) and 96-well plates (for
proliferation analysis). After 12 h, cells were treated
with cathepsin inhibitors (100 µM cysteine cathepsin
inhibitor JPM (Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch,
Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National
Cancer Institute, MD), 250 µM antipain dihydrochloride
(Santa Cruz Biotech) or 10 µg/mL cathepsin inhibitor
peptide (Santa Cruz Biotech). After 24 h of the addition
of cathepsin inhibitors (t=0), cells were treated with 1 µM
doxorubicin (Hospira Inc). Post doxorubicin treatment
at 48 h (t=48), cell viability was measured by propidium
iodide uptake and annexinV-FITC staining by FACS.
The proliferation was detected by MTS assay at 0 h (t=0)
and 48 h (t=48) time points. MTS solution (PMS reagent
(Sigma Life Science®) in DPBS and CellTiter 96®
AQuueous MTS reagent powder (Promega) in DPBS at
the ratio of 1:20, according to manufacturer’s protocol)
was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 1.5 h
after the addition of MTS solution. The absorbance wave
lengths used were 490 nm and 630 nm and the plate was
read using SpectraMaxM5 multi-mode microplate reader
(Molecular Devices). For FACS analysis both the detached
and attached cells were harvested and spun at 2000 g. The
cell pellet was washed and stained with annexin V-FITC
(Invitrogen, Molecular probes) in FACS buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 3.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 7.4
mM HEPES-NaOH, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 0.8 mM K2HPO4)
supplemented with 5% FCS) for 15 min according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Following this step, the cells
were centrifuged and washed once again in FACS buffer.
The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 50 µL of 2.5
ng/µL propidium iodide and the fluorescence was detected
with BD FACS Canto.
