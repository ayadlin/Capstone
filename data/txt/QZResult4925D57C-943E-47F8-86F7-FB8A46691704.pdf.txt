Abstract
CD47, also called integrin-associated protein, plays a critical
role in the innate immune response and is an atypical member
of the immunoglobulin superfamily that interacts with and
activates B3 integrins. B3 integrin / mice have defective
platelet and osteoclast function and are protected from bone
metastasis. The role of CD47 in skeletal homeostasis and
bone metastasis has not been described. CD47 / mice
had increased bone mass and defective osteoclast function
in vivo. Although the number of functional osteoclasts formed
by differentiating CD47 / bone marrow macrophages was
decreased, high doses of RANKL rescued differentiation and
function of CD47 / osteoclasts ex vivo and rescued the
osteoclast defect in CD47 / mice. Inhibition of nitric oxide
(NO) synthase, which is expressed at higher levels in CD47 /
osteoclasts, also rescued the osteoclast defect in CD47 / cells.
We then examined the consequences of this osteoclast defect in
bone metastasis. In a model of tumor metastasis to bone, bone
tumor burden was decreased in the CD47 / mice compared
with wild-type (WT) controls, with no decrease in s.c. tumor
growth in CD47 / mice. There was decreased tumor-associated bone destruction in the CD47 / mice compared with WT
controls, consistent with a defect in osteoclast function that
was not rescued by the presence of tumor. Our data show that
CD47 regulates osteoclastogenesis, in part, via regulation of NO
production, and its disruption leads to a decrease in tumor
bone metastasis. CD47 is a novel therapeutic target to
strengthen bone mass and diminish metastatic tumor growth
in bone. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):3196–204]

Introduction
Bone metastases cause hypercalcemia, bone loss, fractures, and
pain and are thus a significant cause of morbidity and mortality
in cancer patients (1). Several tumor cell types (e.g., breast and
prostate carcinomas and melanomas) metastasize to bone and lead
to bone degradation via activation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts
(1–4). Osteoclasts are formed from the fusion of monocytes/
macrophages and are characterized by their large size, the presence
of multiple nuclei, and positive staining for tartrate-resistant
acid phosphatase (TRAP). Two cytokines, macrophage colonystimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear
factor-nB ligand (RANKL), are necessary for the survival and

differentiation of macrophages into osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo
(5). The osteoclast attaches to bone via the avh3 integrin through
formation of the cytoskeletal organizations called actin rings. The
resorbing osteoclast has a ruffled membrane and expresses
cathepsin K, which is necessary for degrading the organic matrix
of bone, and vacuolar proton pumps (H+-ATPases), which secrete
acid and thus result in bone resorption by dissolving the inorganic
matrix (5).
The presence of tumor cells in the bone microenvironment
results in osteoclast and osteoblast recruitment and activation.
This activation stimulates the release of growth factors from
stromal cells as well as from the bone matrix, which further
promote tumor growth in bone (1–4, 6). This is known as the
vicious cycle of bone metastasis. We have previously shown that
hyperfunctional osteoclasts are permissive for the growth of tumor
cells that home to bone (7, 8). In addition, mice globally deficient
in the h3 integrin, which show a profound defect in platelet and
osteoclast function, are protected from bone metastasis and
tumor-associated bone destruction (9–11).
CD47 (also called integrin-associated protein) was first isolated
through its interaction with the avh3 integrin, which is
prominently expressed on osteoclasts (12–15). Expressed on all
vascular cells, CD47 is an atypical member of the immunoglobulin
superfamily (16) with a single IgV domain, five transmembrane
segments, and a cytoplasmic tail (17). CD47 associates in cis in the
plane of the membrane with avh3 and other integrins (12–15)
and can augment integrin function by this association (18). It
has recently been discovered that CD47, when ligated by
thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), inhibits nitric oxide (NO) signaling in
vascular cells (19). In platelets, TSP1-CD47 signaling opposes the
NO/cyclic guanosine 3¶,5¶-monophosphate (cGMP) inhibition of
integrin activation (20), thus facilitating platelet aggregation. CD47
inhibition of NO signaling has also been shown in several other
in vivo models, suggesting that limiting NO signaling is a primary
function of the TSP1-CD47 system (19–26). Recent data indicate
that the differentiation of bone marrow macrophages into
osteoclast in vitro is sensitive to NO concentration, such that low
levels of NO stimulate osteoclast formation, whereas increased
NO inhibits formation of osteoclast (27). Therefore, CD47 may
modulate NO signaling in osteoclast.
Although CD47 associates with avh3 and augments its function,
h3 / and CD47 / mice have rather different phenotypes. h3 /
mice are a model of Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia, displaying
profound defects in platelet aggregation and clot retraction (10). In
contrast, CD47 / mice have normal bleeding times and a modest
decrease in platelet numbers (28). These differences can be
accounted by the fact that CD47 augments integrin signaling but
is not essential for integrin-mediated adhesion (19). CD47 also has
integrin-independent functions. For example, CD47-SIRP1a interactions are important in innate immune reactions, negatively regulating phagocytosis in vivo. The presence of CD47 on hematopoietic

cells provides them with a ‘‘self-signal’’ that inhibits their phagocytosis (16, 29). The SIRP1a-CD47 interaction has also been postulated to be necessary for macrophage fusion, which is essential
for the formation of osteoclasts (30, 31). Recently, Lundberg and
colleagues (31) reported a defect in formation of osteoclasts from
macrophages in the presence of blocking antibodies to CD47.
Because CD47 is proposed to function in macrophage fusion,
interacts with and activates avh3, and modulates NO signaling, we
hypothesized that CD47 / mice would have altered osteoclast
differentiation and function. Here, we show that CD47 / mice
have a modest increase in bone volume due to defective osteoclast
function in vivo. Furthermore, CD47 / macrophages are defective
in osteoclast formation in vitro. The osteoclast defect is rescued by
increased administration of RANKL both in vitro and in vivo, and
inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) rescues CD47 / osteoclast
differentiation in vitro. To test the role of CD47 in a pathophysiologic context in which osteoclast function is central to disease
pathogenesis, we evaluated bone metastasis and tumor-associated
bone destruction in CD47 / mice.

Materials and Methods
Cells. The B16-F10 C57BL/6 murine melanoma cell line was purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection and modified to express firefly
luciferase (B16-FL; ref. 32).
Animals. CD47 / mice on a pure C57BL/6 background were housed
under pathogen-free conditions according to the guidelines of the Division
of Comparative Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine.
The animal ethics committee approved all experiments. For generation of
CD47 / mice, CD47+/ females were crossed to CD47+/ males and the
females were allowed to have two litters.
Micro–computed tomography. Tibias and femurs were suspended
in agarose and the right proximal tibial and femoral metaphyses were
scanned by micro–computed tomography (ACT; ACT-40; Scanco Medical) as
described previously (33, 34). For image acquisition, the tibias were placed
in a 17-mm holder and scanned. The image consisted of 50 slices. The
trabecular region was selected using contours inside the cortical shell on
each two-dimensional image. The growth plate was used as a marker to
determine a consistent location to start analysis. A three-dimensional
cubical voxel model of bone was built, and the calculations were made as
follows: relative bone volume over total bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular
number, and thickness. A threshold of 300 (of 1,000) was used to
differentiate trabecular bone from nonbone.
Histology, bone histomorphometry, and longitudinal growth
measurements. Mouse tibias were fixed in formalin and decalcified in
14% EDTA. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with H&E and
separately for TRAP. Trabecular bone volume and tumor area were
measured according to a standard protocol using Bioquant Osteo (Bioquant
Image Analysis Corp.). Bone sections were blinded before analysis.
Methylmethacrylate-embedded lumbar vertebral bodies of wild-type (WT)
and CD47 / mice were stained for von Kossa on a counterstain of 0.5%
basic fuchsin. Longitudinal growth was measured by use of calipers on
whole body as well as isolated femurs.
Serum CTX assay. CTX was measured from WT or CD47 / mouse
fasting serum by using a CTX ELISA system (Nordic Bioscience
Diagnostics).
Flow cytometry ( fluorescence-activated cell sorting). Whole bone
marrow was isolated from WT and CD47 / mice and incubated in
blocking medium (2.4G2 hybridoma with 4 mL of mouse IgG) and then
incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse F4/80 or anti-mouse CD47
(miap301) with an anti-rat FITC secondary antibody on ice for 20 min. The
cells were then washed twice and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences).
In vitro osteoclast assays. Whole bone marrow was isolated from WT
C57BL/6 mice and plated in M-CSF containing CMG-14-12 cell culture

supernatant (1:10, v/v) in a-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum in
Petri dishes for 3 d to generate primary bone marrow macrophages.
Bone marrow macrophages were lifted and equal numbers were plated in
48-well dishes in osteoclast medium, a-MEM containing 10% FBS, CMG14-12 supernatant (1:20, v/v), and glutathione S-transferase–RANKL (50 or
100 ng/mL), and incubated at 37jC for 5 d to generate osteoclasts. TRAP
staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Sigma-Aldrich). In Fig. 4, 0, 3, 10, 30, and 100 Ag/mL of N-nitro-L-arginine
methyl ester (L-NAME) were added to cultures at the same time with
M-CSF and RANKL, and medium was changed every day. Osteoclast
cultures were fixed after 4 d in culture and stained for TRAP.
Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR. Reverse transcription
and quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods were carried out as described
previously (8). The following qPCR primers were used: CD47, GGCGCAAAGCACCGAAGAAATGTT ( forward) and CCATGGCATCGCGCTTATCCATTT
(reverse); inducible NOS (iNOS), GGCAGCCTGTGAGACCTTTG ( forward)
and GCATTGGAAGTGAAGCGTTTC (reverse); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, TCAACAGCAACTCCCACTCTTCCA ( forward) and
ACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCGTATTCA (reverse).
Actin ring formation and bone resorption assays. Actin ring
formation and bone resorption assays were performed as described (35).
Briefly, the cells plated on bovine bone slices were fixed with 3%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Filamentous actin was stained with
FITC-labeled phalloidin at 0.3 Ag/mL in PBS. For staining of the resorption
lacunae (pits), the cells were brushed off the bone with a toothbrush. The
slices were incubated with 20 Ag/mL of peroxidase-conjugated wheat
germ agglutinin for 1 h. After washing in PBS, 0.52 mg/mL of 3,3¶diaminobenzidine with 0.1% H2O2 was added onto the bone slices for
15 min. Pit area was determined from five 4 fields by using Osteo software
(Bioquant) blinded to genotype.
In vivo RANKL injections. RANKL (100 Ag) in a volume of 40 AL was
injected subperiostally in the midline calvaria in 8-wk-old mice daily for
5 consecutive days. On the 6th day, serum was collected, mice were
sacrificed, and the calvarial bone was isolated. TRAP staining was
performed on fixed, decalcified, and paraffin-embedded calvarial bone.
Tumor and bone metastasis models. For intracardiac injections, the
operator was blinded to genotype. Mice were anesthetized and inoculated
intracardially via the left ventricular chamber with 105 B16-FL cells in 50 AL
PBS as previously described (7). Bioluminescence imaging was performed
on days 7, 10, and 12 after B16-FL cell inoculation. Mice were sacrificed and
underwent blinded necropsy on day 12 after tumor cell injection. Mice were
discarded from the final analysis if the animal died before day 12 or if
necropsy showed a large mediastinal tumor indicative of injection of tumor
cells into the chest cavity, not the left ventricle.
For intratibial injections, mice were anesthetized, and 1  104 B16-FL
cells in 50 AL PBS were injected into the right tibia. PBS (50 AL) was injected
into the left tibia as an internal control. Animals were radiographed in two
dimensions using an X-ray system to confirm intratibial placement of the
needle (Faxitron Corp.). Bioluminescence imaging was performed on days 7
and 9 after B16-FL cell inoculation. Mice were sacrificed and underwent
necropsy on day 9 after B16-FL inoculation. Mice with i.m. locations of
tumors were discarded from the analysis. For s.c. injections, mice were
anesthetized, and 5  105 B16-FL cells in 100 AL PBS were injected s.c. on
the dorsal surface of the mouse at two sites. Tumor growth was monitored
over the 14-d period after B16-FL injections, and bioluminescence imaging
was performed 5, 7, 10, and 14 d after B16-FL inoculation. The experiment
was terminated due to the presence of large necrotic tumors.
In vivo bioluminescence imaging. Mice were injected i.p. with
150 mg/kg D-luciferin (Biosynthesis) in PBS 10 min before imaging. Imaging
was performed using a charge-coupled device camera (IVIS 100; exposure
time of 1 or 5 min, binning of 8, field of view of 15 cm, f/stop of 1, and no
filter) in collaboration with the Molecular Imaging Center Reporter Core.
Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane (2% vaporized in O2), and C57BL/6
mice were shaved to minimize attenuation of light by pigmented hair. For
analysis, total photon flux (photons per second) was measured from a fixed
region of interest in the tibia/femur, the mandible, or the local s.c. tumor
using Living Image 2.50 and IgorPro software (Wavemetrics).

Results
CD47 / mice have increased bone volume due to dysfunctional osteoclasts. CD47 interacts with and activates h3 integrins.
h3 / mice display osteopetrosis due to osteoclast dysfunction.
Therefore, we hypothesized that CD47 / mice might have an

osteoclast defect. To test this hypothesis, ACT analysis on tibias
from 8-week-old WT and CD47 / littermates was performed.
We observed an increase in trabecular BV/TV in CD47 / mice
compared with WT mice (Fig. 1A and B). There was no change in
trabecular number, but the trabecular thickness was increased in

CD47 / tibias (Fig. 1A and B). Von Kossa staining of the lumbar
vertebral bodies, a marker for mineralized matrix, confirmed
an increase in bone volume and trabecular thickness in CD47 /
mice (Fig. 1B). The increase in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV)
was also confirmed by histomorphometry on histologic sections
(Fig. 1C, a and b). We did not observe a difference in longitudinal
growth of CD47 / mice as measured by femur length and
whole body length (Supplementary Fig. S1). Interestingly, we also
observed that osteoclast perimeter/total trabecular bone perimeter
was not changed in CD47 / mice in vivo (Fig. 1C, c). To confirm
that this increase in BV/TV was due to dysfunctional osteoclasts,
we measured serum CTX, the COOH-terminal telopeptide of
collagen type I that is cleaved on bone resorption by osteoclasts.
We observed a decrease in CTX activity (Fig. 1D), which along with
an increase in trabecular bone volume suggests that the osteoclast
activity was decreased in CD47 / mice in vivo (Fig. 1E).
CD47 / osteoclast defect can be rescued by high doses of
RANKL in vitro. To investigate if the osteoclast defect is cell
autonomous in CD47 / mice, we first determined if macrophages
or osteoclast precursors were decreased in CD47 / bone marrow.
We stained WT and CD47 / whole bone marrow with CD47-FITC

www.aacrjournals.org

as control and F4/80 as a macrophage marker and carried out flow
cytometry. We did not observe a significant difference in F4/80+
cells in CD47 / bone marrow compared with WT controls
(Fig. 2A). To test the differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts,
we cultured whole bone marrow in M-CSF alone for 3 days to
enrich for macrophages. An equal number of macrophages were
then cultured in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL to promote
differentiation into osteoclasts for 7 days. At a dose of 50 ng/mL
of RANKL, we observed induction of CD47 transcript levels over
the course of osteoclast differentiation in WT but not in CD47 /
cells (Fig. 2B). We observed that WT macrophages produced
large, multinucleated, TRAP-positive osteoclasts by day 5, but only
a few osteoclasts formed from CD47 / macrophages. When WT
and CD47 / macrophages were plated onto bovine bone slices,
there was a decrease in the number of multinucleated CD47 /
osteoclasts with multiple actin rings visualized by phalloidin
staining (Fig. 2C). However, when the dose of RANKL was increased
2-fold to 100 ng/mL, the osteoclast differentiation defect was
largely rescued in CD47 / cells. This was reflected in equivalent
numbers of osteoclasts with multiple actin rings formed on bovine
bone from macrophages of both genotypes (Fig. 2C). To determine

midline calvaria of WT (n = 5) and CD47 / (n = 5) mice. Serum CTX was
measured before and after RANKL injections. WT versus CD47 / pre-RANKL,
P < 0.01; WT versus CD47 / post-RANKL, P = 0.74; WT pre-RANKL versus

the functional capacity of CD47 / osteoclasts to resorb bone, we
stained the bones with wheat germ agglutinin to measure the areas
of resorption lacunae after 5 days on bovine bone. There was a
significant decrease in bone resorption by CD47 / osteoclasts in

50 ng/mL RANKL; however, the resorption capacity of CD47 /
osteoclasts was similar to WT at a high dose of RANKL (Fig. 2D).
The osteoclast dysfunction in CD47 / mice was rescued by
in vivo RANKL injections. To determine if RANKL could rescue
CD47 / osteoclast function in vivo as was observed in vitro, we
injected 100 Ag RANKL subperiostally into the midline calvaria
of 8-week-old WT and CD47 / mice. We measured serum CTX
before and after RANKL injections in these mice. Before RANKL
injection, CD47 / mice had lower serum CTX as we have shown
before (Fig. 3A). However, after RANKL administration, osteoclast
activation was not significantly different between WT and CD47 /
mice as measured by serum CTX (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, direct
visualization of osteoclast recruitment by TRAP staining on
histologic sections of calvarial bone in WT and CD47 / mice
confirmed the CTX results (Fig. 3B). We conclude that a high
dose of RANKL rescued the cell-autonomous osteoclast defect in
CD47 / mice.
NOS inhibition restores osteoclast differentiation in CD47 /
cells. Several tissues from CD47 / mice have increased NO
levels (36). We differentiated WT and CD47 / macrophages into
osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL. We observed
that iNOS expression levels were higher in CD47 / osteoclast
cultures compared with WT controls (Fig. 4A). It has been
previously shown that increased levels of NO lead to a block in
osteoclast differentiation (27). We hypothesized that this increase
in NO levels is responsible for the inhibition of osteoclast differentiation in CD47 / cells. We differentiated WT and CD47 /
macrophages into osteoclasts in the presence of L-NAME, a panNOS inhibitor. In CD47 / cells, we observed a dose-dependent
rescue of osteoclast differentiation with L-NAME administration.
We observed a biphasic effect of L-NAME on WT cells, where, at a
low dose of L-NAME, there was modest enhancement of osteoclast
formation and, at a high dose of L-NAME, there was inhibition of
osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 4B). The osteoclast inhibitory dose
of L-NAME on WT cells was enhancing in CD47 / cells. Taken
together, these data support that the increased levels of iNOS in
CD47 / cells negatively affect osteoclast formation.
CD47 / mice have decreased tumor burden and bone loss
in an intracardiac metastasis model. The data above indicate

that, at high doses of RANKL, CD47 was not necessary for
osteoclast differentiation and function. RANKL is produced from
T cells and osteoblasts during inflammatory conditions such as
arthritis and bone metastasis. RANKL is not expressed by B16-FL
cells (data not shown). We thus examined bone metastasis and
osteolysis in CD47 / mice to determine if this local increase in
RANKL is able to rescue the CD47 / osteoclasts in this
pathophysiologic context. We evaluated bone metastasis in WT
and CD47 / mice using murine melanoma B16-F10 cells
engineered to express firefly luciferase (B16-FL). We measured
bone tumor burden by real-time bioluminescence on days 7, 10,

and 12 after intracardiac B16-FL injection, a route of administration that allows for bone metastasis rather than lung infiltration of
injected cells (9, 32). There was a significant decrease in tumor
burden in the femoral/tibial bones and the mandible of CD47 /
mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 5B and C) as measured by
bioluminescence and confirmed by histomorphometric measurement of tumor volume in histologic sections at day 12 after B16-FL
inoculation (Supplementary Fig. S2A; Fig. 5B and C). Tumor cells
are known to secrete factors that activate osteoclasts to degrade
bone and induce osteolysis, which is a significant outcome of
bone metastases (1–4, 6). Trabecular bone volume was measured in

Figure 6. CD47 / mice have decreased tumor burden and bone loss in an intratibial metastasis model but not in a s.c. model. A, B16-FL cells were injected directly
into the tibia of WT (n = 6) and CD47 / (n = 5) mice. Tumor burden in the tibiae was measured by bioluminescence imaging at days 7 and 9 after B16-FL injection
(P = 0.05). Representative bioluminescence images are shown. B, representative images of tibial histologic bone sections at day 9. Tumor volume/total volume
in the tibias of WT (n = 6) and CD47 / (n = 5) mice at day 12 was measured by histomorphometric analysis (P = 0.03). Three independent experiments showed similar
results. C, B16-FL cells were injected s.c. into the hind flank of mice, and tumor burden was measured by bioluminescence imaging at days 5, 7, 10, and 14 after
B16-FL injection.

WT and CD47 / mice injected with B16-FL or saline. Whereas
there was significant bone loss in B16-FL in WT mice, there was no
bone loss in CD47 / bones injected with B16-FL, consistent with
the osteoclast dysfunction in CD47 / mice (Fig. 5B and C). We
did not observe a difference in osteoclast perimeter/trabecular
bone perimeter in tumor-bearing CD47 / bones (Fig. 5D). Thus,
we conclude that CD47 / mice had decreased bone tumor burden
and tumor-associated bone destruction, and the local increase in
RANKL levels in vivo was not sufficient to rescue the osteoclast
defect in CD47 / mice.
CD47 / mice have decreased tumor burden and bone loss
in an intratibial metastasis model but not in a s.c. model. We
have previously shown that platelets are critical for the homing
of tumor cells to bone (9). CD47 / mice have been shown to
have a mild decrease in platelet numbers (28). To further confirm
that this decrease in tumor burden in CD47 / mice after
intracardiac injections of B16-FL cells was not due to compromised homing of tumor cells to bone, we turned to a more direct
model of late-stage bone metastasis that eliminates initial tumorhoming steps of the metastatic process. We injected equal
numbers of B16-FL cells directly into the tibiae of WT and
CD47 / littermates and performed bioluminescence on days 7
and 9 after B16-FL inoculation. Bioluminescence imaging showed
decreased tumor burden over time in the CD47 / mice
compared with WT mice (Fig. 6A). Histomorphometric measurement of tumor volume in histologic sections at day 9 after B16-FL
inoculation confirmed this decrease (Supplementary Fig. S2B;
Fig. 6B).

To confirm that the decrease in bone tumor burden in CD47 /
mice was specific to CD47 function in the bone microenvironment
and not a result of intervention by the immune system or tumorassociated angiogenesis in the CD47 / mice, we measured local
tumor burden in s.c. injected B16-FL cells. We observed no change
in s.c. tumor burden as measured by bioluminescence on days 5, 7,
10, and 14, at which point the experiment was terminated due to
necrotic tumors (Fig. 6C). We conclude that the decrease in tumor
burden in CD47 / mice was specific to the bone compartment
and not due to compromised immunity or platelet interactions.

Discussion
We show here that CD47 / mice exhibited mild osteopetrosis
and decreased osteoclast function in vivo and in vitro. In vitro,
CD47 / macrophages did not form as many multinucleated
spread osteoclasts as WT cells. Bone resorption as measured by pit
staining was decreased in CD47 / cells in vitro. Interestingly, this
osteoclast defect was rescued by delivery of high doses of RANKL
both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that CD47 may cooperate with
RANKL during osteoclast development/function. We observed that
iNOS levels were increased in CD47 / osteoclasts and inhibition
of NOS rescued the osteoclast differentiation defect in CD47 /
cells. We also observed decreased tumor burden and osteolysis in
CD47 / bone after intracardiac or intratibial delivery of tumor
cells.
The first role known for CD47 was based on its physical and
functional interaction with avh3 (37). It is well known that the

integrin avh3 plays a critical role not only in osteoclast function
(11) but also in the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclast
(38). CD47 has been shown to augment avh3 function by physical
association, leading to increased integrin clustering and therefore
increases in avidity. Furthermore, CD47 signals through Gai to
activate avh3 via an ‘‘inside-out’’ signaling pathway analogous to
that used by G protein–coupled receptors on platelets to activate
aIIbh3 via activation of the small G protein Rap1 (20). In platelets,
NO-stimulated cGMP levels oppose Rap1b activation. CD47 acts
to prevent this inhibitory effect of NO, thus allowing more GTP
loading of Rap1b, resulting in aIIbh3 activation (20). It is likely that
CD47 in osteoclasts can activate avh3 in a similar fashion.
Although CD47 could be playing a role in osteoclast differentiation and function by augmenting avh3 signaling, it could also
exert its effects on osteoclasts in a h3-independent manner. The
defect in osteoclast differentiation can be overcome by addition of
high doses of M-CSF to cultures by increasing expression of c-fms
(39). In contrast, we observed that exogenous RANKL administration could rescue the osteoclast defect in CD47 / mice in vivo and
in vitro, suggesting that CD47 might play a role in osteoclastogenesis by enhancing RANKL signaling. It is possible that CD47
and RANKL might stimulate osteoclasts in parallel pathways that
merge at a common signaling molecule. Our data suggest that
the NO/cGMP pathway might be the link between CD47 and
RANKL signaling.
There is a growing literature on the role of NO in osteoclast
differentiation and function. Often, the proposed ‘‘Goldilocks
effect’’ comes into play in NO regulation. NO has been reported
to both promote and inhibit osteoclast differentiation/survival
(27, 40, 41) and osteoclast function (40, 42, 43). Low signaling levels
of NO derived from eNOS (NOSIII) and/or nNOS (NOSI) are most
likely needed to support osteoclast differentiation, whereas higher
levels, such as those produced by iNOS, become inhibitory. We
found that iNOS was significantly induced in CD47 / osteoclast
and inhibition with a NOS inhibitor, L-NAME, rescued CD47 /
osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 4B). Many signaling effects of NO are
mediated via stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase, production
of cGMP, and activation of protein kinase G. However, there are
effects of NO that are accomplished by its direct interaction with
protein thiols (S-nitrosylation) to modify their enzymatic activity
(44, 45). Src, a kinase downstream of RANK signaling known to
have a critical role in osteoclast differentiation and function (46),
is a target of inhibitory S-nitrosylation (47). This modification of
Src by NO in osteoclasts might have a significant effect on
osteoclast function. Such a finely balanced regulatory mechanism

is suggested by our finding that only a 2-fold increase in RANKL
concentration in vitro permits formation of CD47 / osteoclasts
that are as functional as WT osteoclasts.
The second major finding of our study is that the role of CD47 in
osteoclast differentiation/function has a significant effect on the
interaction of tumor cells within the bone microenvironment. The
decreased osteoclast function in CD47 / mice leads to a decrease
in bone tumor burden and osteolysis, consistent with the model
of the vicious cycle of bone metastasis (1–4). Notably, the increase
in bone volume in CD47 / was only f4% compared with WT
mice, not as profound a change as observed in the osteopetrotic
h3 / mice (11). It is interesting that the relatively modest,
rescuable decrease in osteoclast function in CD47 / mice in vivo
could result in a more pronounced decrease in tumor burden and
osteolysis. These results suggest that the relationship between the
osteoclast and the tumor cell with regard to the vicious cycle of
bone metastasis is not one of direct proportionality. The complex
signaling pathways involved in the relationship between tumor
cells and bone cells no doubt involve amplification steps. Both Src
kinase–initiated pathways and the NO/cGMP pathways implicated
here are classic examples of signal amplifiers.
One of the major complications of currently available therapies for
bone metastasis, such as bisphosphonates, is their harsh effect on
bone, leading to conditions such as suppressed bone turnover or
osteonecrosis of the jaw (48, 49). We observed that CD47 / mice
displayed a mild increase in bone volume and a decrease in tumor
burden in bone. Our results suggest the potential for manipulating
CD47 signaling as a novel approach to treatment of osteoporosis
in the general population and to treatment of bone metastasis in
cancer patients without causing severe complications to the skeleton.
