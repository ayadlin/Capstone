ABSTRACT
PPARα belongs to the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)
family, which plays a critical role in inhibiting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis,
while the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Here we report that PPARα serves
as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to govern Bcl2 protein stability. PPARα physically bound
to Bcl2 protein. In this process, PPARα/C102 was critical for PPARα binding to BH3
domain of Bcl2, subsequently, PPARα transferred K48-linked polyubiquitin to lysine-22
site of Bcl2 resulting in its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation.
Importantly, overexpression of PPARα enhanced cancer cell chemotherapy sensitivity.
In contrast, silenced PPARα decreased this event. These findings revealed a novel
mechanism of PPARα governed endogenous Bcl2 protein stability leading to reduced
cancer cell chemoresistance, which provides a potential drug target for cancer
treatment.

apoptosis that is a critical step in tumorigenesis, it is still
unclear the mechanism to govern Bcl2 protein stability.
PPARα belongs to the peroxisome-proliferatoractivated receptors (PPARs) family that contains PPARα,
PPARδ, and PAPRγ [6–8]. PPARα plays a critical role
in inhibiting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. As
a ligand-activated transcription factor, PPARα can be
activated by fatty acids, fatty-acid derivatives LTB4
(leukotriene B4) and synthetic ligands [8, 9]. PPARα is
the first identified PPARs that is expressed in skeletal
muscle, liver, intestine, kidney, heart [10, 11], which
inhibits tumorigenesis in different tissues, including
to colon, breast, lung, lymphocytic leukemia, live, and
ovarian cancer [12–18]. PPARα agonist fenofibrate
induces mantle cell lymphoma apoptosis by activation of
caspase-3 pathway [19]. Consistent with this, fenofibrate
effectively induces primary glial tumor cell apoptosis
by promoting FoxO3A phosphorylation [20]. Further­
more, clofibrate promotes hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cell
apoptosis by increasing PPARα expression [21]. However,

INTRODUCTION
Apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays a critical
role in maintenance of normal tissues homeostasis by
elimination of the unwanted or damaged cells from
organisms [1]. Evasion of apoptosis is a feature of
many cancer cells that is involved in overexpression of
Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) [2]. Bcl2 is a proto-oncogene
to inhibit cell apoptosis in the tumor development.
Deregulated expression of Bcl2 is linked to many human
cancers, such as melanoma, breast, prostate, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, colon, and lung cancer [2–5].
The Bcl2 family proteins contain pro-survival proteins
(Bcl2, Bcl-xl, Mcl1) and pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax,
bad, Bim) [2, 3]. Under normal condition, Bcl2 constrains
the pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak) to maintain the
mitochondrial integrity and cell survival. In contrast,
cytotoxic stimuli (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) activate
pro-apoptotic proteins and induce cell apoptosis [1].
Although deregulated Bcl2 expression leads to impaired

the direct molecular mechanism of PPARα-induced cell
apoptosis is still unclear. Here we found that PPARα
serves an E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce Bcl2 ubiquitination
and degradation leading to cell apoptosis in response to
chemotheraphy drugs.

and real-time PCR shows that PPARα had no effect
on Bcl2 gene expression (Supplementary Figure S3A,
S3B). To further detect whether reduced Bcl2 by PPARα
was involved in proteasome-dependent degradation,
overexpressed PPARα in HeLa cells were treated with
MG132 (proteasome inhibitor). The results show that
PPARα did not reduce Bcl2 protein levels in MG132
treatment cells (Figure 1E), suggesting that PPARα induced
Bcl2 proteasome-dependent degradation. PPARα-induced
Bcl2 degradation was demonstrated by half-life analysis
(Figure 1F). We further detected whether the ligands
of PPARα could effectively increase Bcl2 degradation.
SW480 cells treated with fenofibrate, clofibrate or Wy14,643 had no significantly effect on Bcl2 protein levels
(Supplementary Figure  S4). These findings suggest that
PPARα induced Bcl2 prote­asome-dependent degradation.

RESULTS
PPARα induces Bcl2 degradation
As a nuclear receptor protein, PPARα is expressed
in cytoplasm and nucleus (Supplementary Figure S1). To
detect the interaction of PPARα with Bcl2, SW480 cells
were transfected PPARα shRNA. Western blot shows that
silenced PPARα increased Bcl2 protein levels without
effect on Mcl-1, Bcl-xl and Bcl-w pro-survival protein
levels (Figure 1A). Consistent with this, Bcl2 protein
half-life was significantly increased in PPARα silenced
SW480 cells (Figure 1B). Overexpression of PPARα in
HEK293T cells significantly decreased endogenous or
exogenous Bcl2 protein levels (Figure 1C, 1D), but another
two peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)
family members, PPARγ or PPARδ, had no effect on Bcl2
protein levels (Supplementary Figure S2). We next detected
whether PPARα-reduced Bcl2 protein levels was involved
in Bcl2 transcriptional activity. The analysis of RT-PCR

PPARα serves as E3 ligase to induce Bcl2
ubiquitination
The targeted protein by proteasome undergoes
ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation
[6, 22]. Although PPARα induced Bcl2 degradation, it
is still unclear that whether PPARα could induce Bcl2
ubiquitination. Immunoprecipitation analysis shows that
PPARα significantly induced endogenous and exogenous

was performed. Our results show that UbcH3 but not
UbcH5a/b/c was critical for PPARα-induced polyubiquitin
formation (Figure 2D). Importantly, in vitro binding analysis
shows that PPARα directly bound to UbcH3 (Figure 2E).

As Bcl2 contains two zinc finger domains, the alignment
analysis was performed by using several E3 ubiquitin
ligases with ring domain. The results show that the first zinc

(Supplementary Figure S5). To further identify whether

further detect whether PPARα was the E3 ligase for Bcl2,
in vitro ubiquitination analysis was performed. The results
show that PPARα significantly induced Bcl2 ubiquitination,
but the PPARα/C102A mutant, the enzymic activity site, did
not induce Bcl2 ubiquitination (Figure 2F). Consistent with
this, PPARα/C102A had no effect on Bcl2 ubiquitination
(Figure 2G) and protein half-life (Figure 2H). These
findings suggest PPARα functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase
to induce Bcl2 ubiquitination and degradation.

suggesting that PPARα bound to BH3 domain of Bcl2
(Figure 3C). As C102 of PPARα was the critical enzymic
site for PPARα-induced Bcl2 ubiquitination, further
analysis shows that C102A mutant did not bind to Bcl2
(Figure 3D), suggesting that PPARα/C102 was critical for
binding to Bcl2. These findings suggest that the physical
interaction of Bcl2 with PPARα led to Bcl2 ubiquitination
and degradation.

PPARα interacts with Bcl2

Lysine-22 of Bcl2 is required for PPARα-induced
it ubiquitination and degradation

Although the results have demonstrated that
PPARα induced Bcl2 protein degradation, it is still
unclear the direct interaction of PPARα with Bcl2.
Immunoprecipitation analysis shows that PPARα
physically bound to Bcl2 (Figure 3A). This was also
consistent with overexpression of PPARα binding to Bcl2
(Figure 3B). Bcl2 protein contains BH1, BH2, BH3, and
BH4 domains [3]. To detect the specific binding domain
of PPARα to Bcl2, immunoprecipitation analysis shows
that PPARα did not bind to deleted BH3 domain of Bcl2,

Ubiquitin is attached to the lysine residue on a substrate
that will be recognized and degraded by proteasome pathway
[6, 22]. To identify the specific lysine site for binding to
ubiquitin, the four lysine sites were replaced with arginine
(Figure 4A). Immunoprecipitation analysis shows that
PPARα did not induce Bcl2/K22R mutant ubiquitination
(Figure 4B) and degradation (Figure 4C). Consistent with
this, PPARα did not reduce Bcl2/K22R protein half-life
(Figure 4D). These findings show that lysine-22 was required
for PPARα-induced Bcl2 ubiquitination and degradation.

PPARα/Bcl2 signaling increases cancer cell
sensitivity in response to chemotherapy drugs

as well as increased apoptosis (Figure 5D, Supplementary
Figure S8B). These findings suggest that PPARα induced
Bcl2 ubiquitination and degradation leading to increased
cancer cell chemotherapy sensitivity.

Bcl2 promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis [2].
Our above data have demonstrated that PPARα induced Bcl2
ubiquitination and degradation. We further detected whether
PPARα inhibited Bcl2-mediated cell survival. The results
show that silence of PPARα did not affect cell viability,
but significantly increased cancer cell viability in response
to cytotoxic stimulation (camptothecin, toxal, cisplatin,
etoposide) (Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure S7A, S7B).
As C102 of PPARα was critical for Bcl2 ubiquitination
and degradation, therefore PPARα not C102A significantly
decreased cell viability in response to cytotoxic stimulation
(Figure 5B, Supplementary Figure S8A). Similarly, PPARα
did not reduce Bcl2/K22R mutant cell viability in response
to cytotoxic stimulation (Supplementary Figure S9). As
an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl2 degradation by PPARα
activated the downstream apoptotic signaling in response to
chemotherapeutic agents (caspase-3, PARP-1) (Figure 5C)

DISCUSSION
Evasion of apoptosis is a feature of many cancer
cells that is involved in overexpression of Bcl2, which
inhibits cell apoptosis and enhances chemoresistance
[2]. Aberrant expression of Bcl2 is associated with many
human cancers, such as melanoma, breast, prostate,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon, and lung cancer
[2–5]. Therefore, inhibition of Bcl2 expression contributes
to cancer therapy. Here we show that PPARα serves as
a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce Bcl2 ubiquitination
and degradation. The canonical E3 ubiquitin ligases
contain RING finger domain, which induces the substrate
proteins for ubiquitination and degradation [23]. PPARα

The PPARα E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was identified
by in vitro ubiquitination analysis. The results show that

domain for PPARα E3 ligase activity. Consistent with this,

cancer cell sensitivity in response to hydroxycamptothecin
(HCPT) [24], while the mechanism is still unclear. Further
analysis shows that PPARα significantly increased cancer
cell sensitivity in response to chemotherapy drugs. These
findings were consistent with PPARα-induced Bcl2
degradation. PPARα agonists (fenofibrate, Wyeth14,643,
clofibrate) can induce cancer cell apoptosis and inhibit
tumor angiogenesis in a PPARα dependent or independent
manner [19, 21, 25–27], while our results show that these
ligands had no significant effect on Bcl2 protein levels.
Taken together, PPARα functions as an E3 ubiquitin
ligase to induce Bcl2 ubiquitination and degradation,
leading to increased cancer cell sensitivity in response to
chemotherapy drugs. These findings provide a potential
drug target for cancer treatment.
