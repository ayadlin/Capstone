Abstract
Gambogic acid (GA), the main active compound of Gamboge
hanburyi, has been previously reported to activate apoptosis in
many types of cancer cell lines by targeting transferrin
receptor and modulating nuclear factor-KB signaling pathway.
Whether GA inhibits angiogenesis, which is crucial for cancer
and other human diseases, remains unknown. Here, we found
that GA significantly inhibited human umbilical vascular
endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, migration, invasion,
tube formation, and microvessel growth at nanomolar
concentration. In a xenograft prostate tumor model, we found
that GA effectively inhibited tumor angiogenesis and suppressed tumor growth with low side effects using metronomic
chemotherapy with GA. GA was more effective in activating
apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation and migration in
HUVECs than in human prostate cancer cells (PC3), suggesting
GA might be a potential drug candidate in cancer therapy
through angioprevention with low chemotoxicity. Furthermore, we showed that GA inhibited the activations of vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and its downstream
protein kinases, such as c-Src, focal adhesion kinase, and AKT.
Together, these data suggest that GA inhibits angiogenesis and
may be a viable drug candidate in antiangiogenesis and
anticancer therapies. [Cancer Res 2008;68(6):1843–50]

Introduction
Gambogic acid (GA; C38H44O8, MW 628.76), a polyprenylated
xanthone, is the main active compound of Gamboge hanburyi
(a traditional Chinese medicine) used as detoxification, homeostasis, antiinflammatory, and parasiticide medicines for thousands
of years (1). Previous studies reported that GA-activated apoptosis
in many cancer cell lines and inhibited human hepatoma SMMC7721 tumor growth in vivo in a nude mouse model (2–7). Recent
reports showed the molecular mechanism of apoptosis activation
effect of GA by binding to the transferrin receptor (8) and
suppressing nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) signaling pathway (9).
Whether GA inhibits angiogenesis, a crucial step in tumor growth
and metastasis, is still unknown. Here, we examined the effects of
GA on migration, invasion, and tube formation of endothelial cells
and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.

Recently, increased interests focused on metronomic chemotherapy with comparatively low doses of drug on a frequent or
continuous schedule based on antiangiogenesis. In the chemotherapy with angiogenesis inhibitors, endothelial cells were reported to
be the first to undergo apoptosis compared with cancer cells in the
tumor (10). In preclinical models of tumor treatment, metronomic
chemotherapy showed its advantages of no tumor cell resistance to
the same chemotherapeutics and less acute toxicity (11, 12). There
are several angiogenesis inhibitors in phase I or phase II clinical
trials, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
(VEGFR2) inhibitors (10). To test whether GA inhibits tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth, we used metronomic chemotherapy
method with GA in a xenograft prostate tumor model and found
that GA inhibited tumor angiogenesis and prevented tumor growth.
VEGFRs and their signaling pathways represent rate-limiting
steps in physiologic angiogenesis (13, 14). VEGFRs undergo ligandinduced homodimerization or heterodimerization that activates
their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities (15). VEGFR1 is poorly
autophosphorylated in response to VEGF in endothelial cells and is
weakly involved in transducing the VEGF angiogenic signals (16).
VEGFR3 mainly functions in the establishment and maintenance of
lymphatics (15). In contrast, homodimerization of VEGFR2 leads to
a strong autophosphorylation of several tyrosine residues of
VEGFR2. VEGFR2 is the primary receptor mediating the angiogenic
activity of VEGF through distinct signal transduction pathways that
regulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, differentiation,
and tube formation. Major autophosphorylation sites on VEGFR2
have been described as Y1175 and Y951(15). In particular,
phosphorylation of Tyr1175 is required for activation of AKT, which
is critical for subsequent activation of endothelial cell survival,
migration, and proliferation (17). Phosphorylation of Y951 is
necessary for activation of c-Src, which regulates cell migration.
VEGFR2 regulates cell migration and focal adhesion turnover by
mediating the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK; refs. 15, 16,
18). Here, we examined the effect of GA on the activation of
VEGFR2 and its downstream kinases: c-Src, FAK, and AKT.
In this study, we investigated the effects of GA on angiogenesis,
tumor angiogenesis in the prostate tumor model, and the underlying
molecular mechanisms. We found that GA significantly inhibited
endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tube formation,
angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and tumor-angiogenesis. GA acts as
a VEGFR2 inhibitor and suppressed the VEGFR2 signaling pathway
and its downstream kinases.

the same series of concentrations of gambogic acid. HUVECs were allowed
to migrate for 4 h at 37jC, 5% CO2. After the incubation, cells on the top
surface of the membrane (nonmigrated) were scraped with a cotton swab.
Cells on the bottom side of the membrane (migrated cells) were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed thrice with 1  PBS. The cells
were stained by H&E staining and then destained with 1  PBS. Images
were obtained using an OLYMPUS inverted microscope and with invading
cells being quantified by manual counting. Percentage inhibition of invading
cells was quantified and expressed on the basis of untreated cells (control)
representing 100% (t test, P < 0.01).
Tube formation assay. Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were thawed at 4jC
for overnight, and each well of prechilled 24-well plates was coated with
100 AL Matrigel and incubated at 37jC for 45 min. HUVECs (4  104 cells)
were added in 1 mL ECGM with various concentrations of GA. After 12 to
16 h of incubation at 37jC, 5% CO2, endothelial cell tube formation was
assessed with OLYMPUS inverted microscope. Tubular structures were
quantified by manual counting of low power fields (25), and inhibition
percentage was expressed using untreated wells as 100% (t test, P < 0.001).
Aortic ring assay. Aortic ring assay was performed, as previously
described with some modifications (19, 20). Forty-eight–well plates were
covered with 100 AL of Matrigel at 4jC and incubated at 37jC, 5% CO2 for 30
min. Aortas isolated from mice were cleaned of periadventitial fat and
connective tissues, and cut into f1-mm-long to 1.5-mm-long rings. After
being rinsed five times with endothelial cell–based medium, the aortas were
placed on the Matrigel-covered wells and covered with another 100 AL of
Matrigel. Artery rings were cultured in 1.5 mL of ECGM without serum for 24
h, and then the medium was replaced with 1.5 mL of ECGM with or without
GA. The medium was changed every 2 d with the exact composition as
described above. After 4 d of incubation, the microvessel growth was
quantified by taking photographs with Olympus IX 70 invert microscope
with a 4 objective lens. After images were acquired, the outgrowth area was
delineated and measured with the Pro plus software (Media Cybernetics).
Matrigel plug assay. Matrigel (0.5 mL/plug) with no VEGF or GA, VEGF
(4 ng/mL) but no GA, VEGF (4 ng/mL) and 0.1/0.2 Amol/L GA in liquid form
at 4jC, respectively, were injected s.c. in the midventral abdominal region of
5-week-old to 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice ( five mice for each group). After
7 d, the mice were sacrificed and the plugs were removed. Each group had
four to five Matrigel plugs. The Matrigel plugs were fixed with formalin and

embedded with paraffin. The 5-Am sections were stained with H&E staining.
The number of erythrocyte-filled blood vessels in high power field (HPF;
200 ) was counted (plug number, 4–5; t test, P < 0.005).
Xenograft mouse model. The 5-week-old to 6-week-old severe combined
immune deficiency (SCID) male mice (ordered from NIH) weighing f20 g
were divided into groups with five mice per group. PC3 cells were s.c.
injected (2  106 cells per mouse) into the mice (20). After the tumors had
become established (f50 mm3), the mice were s.c. injected with or without
3 mg/kg GA everyday. The mice body weights and tumor sizes were recorded
everyday, and the tumor sizes were determined by Vernier caliper
measurements and calculated as length  width  height. After 15 d, mice
with s.c. tumors not greater than 1.5 cm in diameter were sacrificed (21).
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Tumors were removed and
fixed with Histochoice MB (Molecular Biology) tissue fixative (Amresco) and
embedded with paraffin. Specific blood vessel staining was performed on
the 5-Am sections with Chemicon’s blood vessel staining kit (von Willebrand
Factor, Chemicon International). Images were taken with ZEISS Axioskop 40
photo microscope. The number of blood vessels was counted (plug number,
4–5; t test, P < 0.005).
VEGFR2 inhibition assay. A 12.5-AL of the 4  reaction cocktail
containing 100 ng VEGFR2 (supplied from the HTScan VEGFR2 kinase
assay kit, Cell Signaling Technology) was incubated with 12.5 AL/tube of GA
for 5 min at room temperature. A 25-AL of 2 ATP/substrate peptide
cocktail was added to the preincubated reaction cocktail/GA compound.
After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, a 50-AL stop buffer
(50 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8) was added per tube to stop the reaction. Then
25 AL of each reaction were transferred with 75 AL H2O/well to a 96-well
streptavidin-coated plate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated at
room temperature for 60 min. After washing the wells thrice with 200 AL/
well PBS/T (0.05% Tween 20 in 1  PBS), a 100-AL primary antibody
[phosphorylated tyrosine monoclonal antibody (pTyr-100), 1:1000 in PBS/T
with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)] was added per well. After being
incubated at room temperature for 60 min, the wells were washed thrice
with 200 AL PBS/T. A 100-AL diluted HRP-labeled antimouse IgG (1:500 in
PBS/T with 1% BSA) was added per well. After incubation at room
temperature for 30 min, the wells were washed five times with 200 AL PBS/T
per well. Then, a 100 AL/well TMB substrate was added per well, and the
plate was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The stop solution

Figure 3. GA inhibits tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo . PC3 cells were injected s.c. (2  106 per mouse) into the 5-week-old to 6-week-old SCID
male mice. After the tumors had established (f50 mm3), the mice were injected with or without 3 mg/kg/d GA. After 15 d, mice were sacrificed and tumors were
removed and taken images by Nikon camera. A, tumors of control group increased from 51.18 F 5.3 to 1144 F 169 mm3, whereas tumors from GA-treated

(100 AL/well) was added and mixed, followed by incubation at room
temperature for 15 min. The plate was then detected at 405 nm with
VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices), and the data (mean F
SE, n = 3) were repeated thrice.
Western immunoblotting. HUVECs pretreated with or without
4 nmol/L VEGF for 5 min were treated with or without GA for another
5 min. A 200-Ag total cellular protein of each sample was immunoprecipitated with anti–c-Src, anti-FAK, and anti-AKT antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotech) and then subjected to the Western blotting. The pTyr antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotech) was used for detecting c-Src phosphorylation, and
pFAK397 antibody (Cell Signaling) was blotted for c-Src–associated FAK
phosphorylation at multiple tyrosine residues. In addition, AKT phosphorylation was examined using pSer473-AKT antibody (Cell Signaling).
Anticleaved caspase-3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech) was used for detecting
cleaved caspase-3 and poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage was
detected by anti-PARP p85 fragment (Promega) in apoptosis assay.
Statistical analysis. The data (mean F SE, n = 3) were repeated thrice
for cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and aortic ring assays.
Statistical significance of differences between control and sample groups
was determined by t test. The minimal level of significance was P < 0.05.

Results
GA inhibits HUVEC migration, invasion, and tube formation. As cell migration is necessary for endothelial cells in

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

angiogenesis and for cancer cells in tumor growth and metastasis
(22, 23), we performed wound healing migration assays to
determine the effects of GA (Fig. 1A) on HUVEC migration and
found 10 nmol/L GA strongly inhibited the migration of inactivated
HUVECs (Fig. 1B). Cell invasion is a critical aspect of endothelial
cells in angiogenesis (24), we performed transwell assays to
evaluate the ability of inactivated HUVECs to pass through the
membrane barrier of the transwell in the presence of GA. As shown
in Fig. 1C, 40 nmol/L GA inhibited almost all invasion activities of
inactivated HUVECs, suggesting that GA significantly inhibited the
invasion properties of endothelial cells at very low concentrations
(nmol/L).
Although angiogenesis is a complex procedure of several kinds of
cells, tube formation of endothelial cells is the key step (25). To further
investigate the effect of GA on endothelial cell tube formation, we
added HUVECs (4  104) in 1 mL ECGM with different concentration
of GA onto Matrigel layers. After 12 to 16 hours of incubation, the
ability of endothelial cells forming tube-like structures was assessed
with an inverted photomicroscope. Approximately, 50 nmol/L GA
inhibited 50% tube formation of HUVEC cells on Matrigel assays and
100 nmol/L GA completely inhibited the tube formation ability of
HUVECs on Matrigel (Fig. 1D).

Gambogic Acid Inhibits Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth

GA inhibits angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. To examine
the inhibitory effect of GA on angiogenesis, we performed aortic
ring assays using isolated aortas from mice. The 1-mm-long to
1.5-mm-long aortic rings were put on Matrigel and covered by
another Matrigel layer and ECGM with or without GA. After
4 days of incubation, the numbers of microvessel growth of
the aortic rings were quantified and compared in the presence
or absence of GA. We found that 10 nmol/L GA (higher concentration not shown) inhibited almost all new microvessel growth
(Fig. 2A), suggesting that GA dramatically inhibited angiogenesis
in vitro.
To further verify the inhibitory effect of GA on angiogenesis, we
used Matrigel plug assay for antiangiogenesis effect of GA in vivo.
We s.c. injected Matrigel (0.5 mL/plug) with no VEGF, VEGF
(4 ng/mL), VEGF (4 ng/mL) and 0.1 Amol/L GA, or 0.2 Amol/L GA
in the midventral abdominal region of 5-week-old to 6-week-old
C57BL/6 mice ( five mice for each group). After 7 days, the mice
were sacrificed and the Matrigel plugs were removed, sectioned,
and H&E stained. As shown in Fig. 2B, 100 nmol/L GA inhibited
VEGF-dependent angiogenesis whereas 200 nmol/L GA totally
abolished angiogenesis in the Matrigel plug assays, indicating GA
strongly inhibited angiogenesis in vivo. Based on the above
analyses, we concluded that GA inhibited angiogenesis in vitro
and in vivo using different angiogenesis assays.
GA inhibits tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo.
Tumor angiogenesis provides oxygen, nutrients, and main routes
for tumor growth and metastasis and acts as a rate-limiting step in
tumor procedures (26). Metronomic chemotherapy is an effective
method to suppress tumor growth for angiogenesis inhibitors with
low dose of drug (10). To determine the effect of GA on tumor

angiogenesis and tumor growth at low dosage, we used a xenograft
mouse prostate tumor model. It has been shown that 4 mg/kg of GA
at a frequency of one treatment every 2 days is a nontoxic dosage
(27). We injected s.c. (2  106 PC3 cells per mouse) into the mice.
After the tumors had become established (f50 mm3), the mice were
s.c. injected with or without 3 mg/kg GA everyday. The mouse body
weights and tumor sizes were recorded everyday, and the tumor
sizes were measured by Vernier caliper and calculated as length 
width  height, as previously described (21). After 15 days, mice were
sacrificed and the tumors were removed. As shown in Fig. 3A, at day
15 after injection of tumor cells, the average tumor size of control
group was 1,144 F 169 mm3, whereas that of GA-treated group was
169.1 F 25.6 mm3. The average tumor weight of control group was
0.28 F 0.08 g, whereas that of GA-treated group was 0.012 F 0.0008 g
(Fig. 3B), indicating that GA significantly inhibited tumor growth
with metronomic chemotherapy.
To examine the inhibitory effect of GA on tumor angiogenesis,
we stained the 5-Am tumor sections with specific blood vessel
staining kit. The average vessel number in tumors of control group
was 14 F 2 (HPF), whereas that in GA-treated group was 1.8 F 1.3
(HPF; Fig. 3C), indicating that GA significantly inhibited tumor
angiogenesis and prevented prostate tumor growth. To evaluate the
side effect or chemotoxicity of GA on mice normal growth, we
recorded the mice body weights everyday. During the 15 days, the
average body weight of control group decreased 1 F 1.3 g, whereas
that of the GA-treated group increased 3.2 F 0.9 g (Fig. 3D),
indicating that 3 mg/kg/day GA for mice is not a toxic dosage or at
least a low-toxic dosage. The observed mouse body weight decrease
in control group is probably due to the tumor burden compared
with the GA-treated group.

GA is more effective in inhibiting cell migration and
proliferation and activating apoptosis in HUVECs than in
PC3 cancer cells. To better understand the inhibitory effects of GA
on angiogenesis/tumorangiogenesis and tumor growth, it is
important to explore whether GA has different effects on cell
migration, proliferation, and apoptosis in endothelial and tumor
cells. Considering that VEGFR2 is the primary receptor through
which VEGFs regulate the angiogenic activities in both normal
angiogenesis and tumor angiogenesis and that HUVECs express
VEGFR2 (KDR/Flk-1) but PC3 cancer cells do not express VEGFR2
(28), we firstly examined the effects of GA on VEGF-dependent cell
migration in HUVEC and PC3 cells. We found 10 nmol/L GA
strongly inhibited VEGF-dependent migration of HUVECs (Fig. 4A),
whereas >100 nmol/L GA was required to inhibit VEGF-dependent
migration for PC3 cancer cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that GA
suppressed VEGF-induced cell migration for both endothelial cells
and cancer cells and that endothelial cells were more sensitive to
GA inhibition compared with PC3 cancer cells. Then we performed
proliferation assays of HUVEC and PC3 cancer cells with GA. We
found that 80 nmol/L GA inhibited 50% HUVEC cell proliferation
(Fig. 4C), whereas >400 nmol/L GA were required to obtain the
same inhibitory effect on PC3 cancer cells (Fig. 4D), indicating that
GA was more effective in inhibiting proliferation of endothelial
cells than that of PC3 cancer cells. Before we examined the effects
of GA in activating apoptosis in HUVEC and PC3 cancer cells, we
identified GA-promoted apoptosis in HUVECs with anticleaved
caspase-3 and anticleaved PARP antibodies (Fig. 4E). Finally, we
measured the apoptotic population of HUVEC and PC3 cancer cells
treated with GA by flow cytometry analysis (fluorescence-activated
cell sorting assays). As shown in Table 1, 80 nmol/L GA induced
40% HUVECs into apoptosis, whereas only 4% of PC3 cancer cells
were induced into apoptosis by the same concentration of GA,
indicating that GA was much more effective on endothelial cells
than on PC3 cancer cells in promoting cell apoptosis. Taken
together, the above different effects of GA on HUVECs and PC3
cancer cells suggest VEGFR2 is primarily, if not exclusively,
expressed on endothelial cells. Thus, the inhibitory effects seen
with PC-3 cell xenografts in mice (Fig. 3) are due to inhibition of
angiogenesis and GA regulates the activity of VEGFR2.
GA is an inhibitor of VEGFR2. VEGFR2 is the primary receptor
in VEGF signaling pathway that regulates endothelial cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, tube formation, and angiogenesis (14, 15). To understand the molecular mechanism of
GA-mediated antiangiogenesis effect, we examined whether GA
inhibits the activation of VEGFR2. We found GA dramatically
inhibited the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 in the assays (Fig. 5A),
suggesting that GA is a potential inhibitor of VEGFR2. To verify
the inhibitory effect of GA on VEGFR2, we further examined the
effects of different concentrations of GA on the specific activation
of VEGFR2 using HTScan VEGFR2 kinase assay kit according to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

suggested methods (Cell Signaling Technology and PerkinElmer
Life Sciences). We found that GA inhibited VEGFR2 kinase
activity with the IC50 of 12 pmol/L (Fig. 5B), indicating GA is a
potent VEGFR2 inhibitor.
GA inhibits VEGFR2 signaling pathway. VEGFR2 regulates cell
migration and proliferation by regulating the activation of FAK and
c-Src (29–31). To understand the inhibitory effects of GA on cell
proliferation and migration, we examined the effects of GA on the
phosphorylation of Src and FAK. As shown in Fig. 5C, GA
significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of both c-Src and FAK
but not affected the total protein expression of c-Src or FAK,
suggesting that GA inhibited cell migration and proliferation by
inhibiting VEGFR2 and its downstream protein kinase activities.
The activation of c-Src with VEGF pretreatment (Fig. 5C, left) was
stronger than that without VEGF treatment (Fig. 5C, right), which
was consistent with VEGF-promoted c-Src activation by stimulating VEGFR2.
The phosphorylation of Y1175 of VEGFR2 mediates the activation
of AKT to regulate cell proliferation (32). To further examine the
downstream signaling pathways mediated by VEGFR2, we
examined the activation of the serine/threonine kinase AKT
(PKB). As shown in Fig. 5C, GA inhibited AKT phosphorylation
(Fig. 5C), suggesting GA inhibited cell proliferation by regulating
the activation of AKT signaling pathways.

Discussion
We identified GA as a novel VEGFR2 inhibitor and comprehensively showed that GA inhibited angiogenesis and tumor progression. Our work focuses on inhibitory effects of GA on HUVEC
proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation—four key
characteristics of endothelial cells in angiogenesis. By directly
blocking VEGFR2 phosphorylation and activation, GA suppressed
the AKT signaling pathway and inhibited cellular proliferation. As a
consequence of VEGFR2 inhibition by GA, the phosphorylation and
activation of c-Src and FAK were blocked. Using nontoxic dosage of
GA, we showed that GA can inhibit tumor angiogenesis and
prostate tumor growth in SCID mouse models.
We showed that GA is a potent VEGFR2 inhibitor, which could
provide a new mechanism of actions for xanthone family members
(33). We observed GA was more effective in activating apoptosis
and inhibiting migration and proliferation in HUVECs than that in
PC3 cancer cells, which was in agreement with previous reports
that HUVECs express VEGFR2 but PC3 cancer cells do not express
it (28). GA also arrested the migration and proliferation of PC3
cancer cells at relatively high concentration, indicating that GA
may not specifically inhibit VEGFR2 and GA may attenuate the
actions of other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) at high doses. As
compounds that act as RTK inhibitors always show inhibitory
characteristics for multiple kinases (34), we will further investigate

whether GA can inhibit other receptor tyrosine kinases. Interestingly, we also found that GA was more effective in inhibiting
HUVEC migration (10 nmol/L) and invasion (40 nmol/L) than in
inhibiting HUVEC proliferation (100 nmol/L) and activating
apoptosis, suggesting that GA could inhibit endothelial cell
migration and invasion before its reported effects on cell
proliferation and apoptosis during angioprevention. These findings
may provide a molecular mechanism for GA as a new antiangiogenesis candidate with low chemotoxicity during chemotherapy.
Phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Tyr1175 is required for the
activation of AKT and endothelial cell proliferation (17). We found

that GA inhibited the activation of VEGFR2 and AKT, as well as cell
proliferation. Phosphorylation of Tyr951 of VEGFR2 is required for
the binding site of TSAD, which mediates its substrate of c-Src and
then regulates cell migration. VEGFR2 also directly regulates the
phosphorylation of FAK and mediates cell migration (22, 35, 36). In
this study, we show that GA inhibits the activation of FAK and c-Src
and cell migration.
Although the relationship between antiinflammation and
angioprevention has not been fully understood, recent studies
have reported several ‘‘classic’’ antiinflammatory drugs lead to
angioprevention (37), such as epigallocatechin gallate in green tea

Figure 5. GA inhibits the activation of
VEGFR2 and its downstream protein
kinases. A, 1 nmol/L GA strongly inhibited
VEGF-induced phosphorylation and
activation of VEGFR2. After starvation
in ECGM without serum for overnight,
HUVECs were washed with 1  PBS twice,
followed by incubation in M199 medium.
Then HUVECs were treated with 1 nmol/L
of GA in the presence or absence of 4
nmol/L of VEGF for 5 min. VEGFR2 was
immunoprecipitated using anti-VEGFR2
antibody. Anti–phosphorylated tyrosine
antibody was used for the detection of
phosphorylation of tyrosine residue of
VEGFR2. B, inhibition of GA on VEGFR2
activation in a specific VEGFR2 inhibition
assay. The calculated IC50 is 12 pmol/L,
and the IC50 was identified as the
concentration of GA to inhibit 50% of the
activity of 100 ng VEGFR2. The data
(mean F SE, n = 3) repeat three times. C,
GA suppressed VEGFR2-mediated protein
kinase activation of c-Src, FAK, and AKT.
HUVECs, pretreated with or without
4 nmol/L VEGF for 5 min, were treated
with GA for another 5 min. D, diagram

(38), through mechanisms that include interference with VEGF
signaling pathway (39, 40). In this study, we showed significant
inhibitory effects of GA, a traditional Chinese medicine used as
antiinflammatory for thousands of years, on angiogenesis in vitro
and in vivo. We identified GA as a VEGFR2 inhibitor for the first
time, which might add a new classic drug member with both
antiinflammatory and antiangiogenesis functions.
Pandey et al. showed GA potentiated tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)–induced apoptosis and inhibits TNF-induced cellular
invasion through NF-nB signaling pathway (9). TNF, via its
receptor 2 (TNF receptor 2, TNFR2), regulates endothelial cell
migration, invasion, and tube formation, but TNFR2 lacks an
intrinsic kinase activity (41, 42). Interestingly, Zhang et al.
reported that the activation of TNFR2 was VEGFR2 dependent
and VEGFR2 inhibitor suppressed the activation of VEGFR2 and
then inhibited activation of TNFR2 (17). We found that GA could
function as a VEGFR2 inhibitor, significantly blocking endothelial
cell migration, invasion, and tube formation. Therefore, it is

possible that GA regulates NF-nB signaling pathway by inhibiting
the activation of VEGFR2 and TNFR2.
In summary, our studies show an axis of action by GA, e.g., GA
functions as an inhibitor of VEGFR2 and its signaling pathway,
leading to the inhibition of angiogenesis and tumorigenesis (Fig.
5D). We showed the previously unreported inhibition of GA on
HUVEC cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, as well as
the antiangiogenesis activity of GA in vitro and in vivo. Our data
suggest a new mechanism of action for the well-known xanthone
family and their potential as antiangiogenesis and anticancer
drugs.
