ABSTRACT
Alterations in the signaling pathways of epidermal growth factor receptors
(HERs) are associated with tumor aggressiveness. Neurotensin (NTS) and its high
affinity receptor (NTSR1) are up regulated in 60% of lung cancers. In a previous
clinical study, NTSR1 overexpression was shown to predict a poor prognosis for 5 year
overall survival in a selected population of stage I lung adenocarcinomas treated by
surgery alone. In a second study, shown here, the frequent and high expression of
NTSR1 was correlated with a pejorative prognosis in 389 patients with stage I to III
lung adenocarcinoma, and was an independent prognosis marker.
Interactions between NTS and NTSR1 induce pro-oncogenic biological effects
associated with neoplastic processes and tumor progression. Here we highlight the
cellular mechanisms activated by Neurotensin (NTS) and its high affinity receptor
(NTSR1) contributing to lung cancer cell aggressiveness. We show that the NTS
autocrine and/or paracrine regulation causes EGFR, HER2, and HER3 over-expression
and activation in lung tumor cells. The EGFR and HER3 autocrine activation is
mediated by MMP1 activation and EGF “like” ligands (HB-EGF, Neuregulin 1) release.
By establishing autocrine and/or paracrine NTS regulation, we show that tumor
growth is modulated according to NTS expression, with a low growth rate in those
tumors that do not express NTS. Accordingly, xenografted tumors expressing NTS
and NTSR1 showed a positive response to erlotinib, whereas tumors void of NTSR1
expression had no detectable response. This is consistent with the presence of a NTS
autocrine loop, leading to the sustained activation of EGFR and responsible for cancer
aggressiveness.
We propose the use of NTS/NTSR1 tumor expression, as a biomarker for the use
of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients lacking EGFR mutation.

INTRODUCTION

by three subtypes of receptor; NTSR1 and NTSR2 exhibit
high (sub-nanomolar) and low (nanomolar) affinity
for NTS, respectively, and belong to the family of G
protein receptors. NTSR3 or gp/95/sortilin is a single
transmembrane domain receptor [17].
Exogenous activation of NTSR1 leads to cell
proliferation, survival, mobility and invasion in cancer
cells from diverse origin [18,19]. These effects are the
result from the activation of kinases and effectors, such
as PKC, MAPK, FAK, RHO-GTPase, RAS and Scr
[20,25]. The PKC activation may induce MAPK by
direct stimulation of Raf-1, or by transactivation of the
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) [20,26,27].
The activation of MAPK via NTSR1 is mainly associated
with uncontrolled cell growth, which aggravates the
growth of tumors [28,29].
We have focused on the contribution of NTS/
NTSR1 complex in breast and lung cancers. In breast
cancer cells, NTSR1 up regulation was the result of beta
catenin cellular and nuclear delocalization [30]. Both
NTS and NTSR1 were expressed in 20 and 40 % of the
tumor breast and lung tumors, respectively. NTSR1 high
expression is a negative prognostic marker in a selected
population of stage I lung adenocarcinomas, treated
by surgery alone, and in ductal invasive carcinomas
[31,32]. The removal of NTSR1 expression in both
lung and breast cancer cells caused a reduction of tumor
growth and metastasis, demonstrating the contribution
of this complex in tumor progression in breast and
lung cancers [31,33]. NTSR1 is a G protein coupled
receptor endocytosed following NTS exposure. We
have shown that intense and chronic NTS exposure
lead to the sustained activation of NTSR1 signaling and
NTS targeted genes [34,36]. These cellular conditions
are similar to autocrine and paracrine exposition that
would occur in human tumor cells since both factors are
expressed in human cancers.
In this study, we highlight the contribution of
autocrine and paracrine NTS regulation to lung cancer
cell aggressiveness. We show that sustained stimulation of
NTSR1 results in the activation of MMP1, the release of
HB-EGF and NGR1 followed by EGFR, HER2 and HER3
overexpression and activation. This cascade results in an
increase in the growth of experimental lung tumors.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in western countries [1,2]. Despite advances in
medical and surgical care, the 5-year overall survival
of NSCLC remains poor (10 to 20%) [3,4]. The stage
of the disease is the most useful parameter in deciding
management and defining prognosis. However, survival
is heterogeneous even within a single stage [3,5].
Therefore, the identification of biological parameters
allowing characterization, and validation of tumor subsets
possessing aggressive phenotypes, is an ongoing challenge
for lung cancer biological studies. In recent years,
significant progress has been made in understanding the
molecular mechanisms of bronchial carcinogenesis. For
example, recent success in new cancer therapies targeting
epidermal growth factor receptors, or their downstream
signalization, illustrated their decisive roles in tumor
aggressiveness [6,7]. Malignant transformation of normal
bronchial cells is a multistep process, characterized by
the accumulation of sequential genetic or epigenetic
alterations [8]. Some of these genetic alterations such as
EGFR mutations, and ALK gene rearrangements offer
opportunities to identify and characterize subpopulations
of patients eligible for specific therapies [9,11].
In tumoral cells, EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4
functions can be abnormally exacerbated because of
genetic defaults, protein over-expression, or overactivation of one or several of these receptors. In tumors,
these regulations are not mutually exclusive and confer
a large magnitude of oncogenic activities. Constitutive
activation of HERs induces sustained proliferative
signaling, and activates invasion and metastasis, both
hallmarks of cancer [8]. Constitutive activation of
HERs becomes installed with the overexpression of
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the subsequent
activation of EGF “like” ligands. Activation of the matrix
metalloproteinases, MMPS and ADAMS, provokes the
shedding of EGF “like” ligands [12], with autocrine or
juxtacrine activation of EGFR and HER3, occurring with
the shedding of HB-EGF, a specific ligand for EGFR, and
neuregulin a specific ligand for HER3 [13]. Whereas, it
is clear that this participates in the aggressive phenotype
of the tumoral cells, it is difficult to target this cascade
with therapeutic molecules because it encompasses many
factors and effectors. Finding an upstream factor which
could be pharmacologically targeted would be a more
successful strategy.
NTS, a 13 amino acids peptide, is present and
biologically active in the central nervous system and in
periphery [14,15]. At the peripheral level, neurotensin is
released by the endocrine cells (N) of the intestinal mucosa
after meals and acts as an endocrine hormone involved in
the postprandial regulation of the motor functions of the
gastrointestinal tract [16]. The effects of NTS are mediated

RESULTS
The NTS/NTSR1 complex enhances cellular
growth
In previous studies, we showed that both NTS
and NSTR1 are concomitantly expressed in human lung
tumors. NTS actions, possibly occurring in tumor, are
therefore mediated through autocrine and/or paracrine
regulation [31]. In order to evaluate the contribution

of NTS in the context of autocrine and/or paracrine
regulation, we studied cellular subpopulations from the
highly metastatic lung carcinoma cell line, LNM-35 [37].
LNM-R cells (expressing NTS and NTSR1) and LNM-F
cells (expressing mainly NTSR1) were isolated from
the parental LNM-35 cells and the observed phenotypes
remained with cultured passages (Figure 1A inset).
We confirmed the differential expression of NTS
in the two subclones by radioimmunoassay. The LNM-R
culture media contained large amounts of NTS, which
accumulated with time (75 to 625 fmol/ml), whereas
the media of LNM-F cells contained 20 fold less NTS
(Figure 1S A). NTSR1 immunocytochemistry experiments
revealed a non-activated NTS/NTSR1 state in LNM-F
cells, with NTSR1 localization at the cell surface. In
contrast, a constitutively activated state of NTSR1 was
found in LNM-R cells as revealed by the localization of
NTSR1 in a peri-nuclear area (Figure 1S B) [36].
We first evaluated the contribution of NTS/NTSR1
complex on cellular growth on the LMN-R cells silenced
for NTS or NTSR1. The clones were named R-SI NTS
and R-SI NTSR1, respectively [31] (Figure 1A inset).
Exogenous chronic treatment (48h) of R-SI NTS cells
with NTS or a low degradable NTS agonist, JMV 449,
induced a two fold increase in the cellular growth (Figure
1 A). In contrast, R-SI NTSR1 cells were not responsive,
as expected, since the NTSR1 was silenced.
To analyze the autocrine/paracrine cooperativity
of the NTS/NTSR1 complex, we created an in
vitro model, by mixing LNM-F and LNM-R cell
subpopulations. Cells were seeded at sub-confluency
with a ratio of 20% of LNM-R and 80% of LNM-F,
(R/F 20/80), and counted after 72h of culture. This
proportion of the cell subpopulations was chosen
because it is similar to the proportion of LNM-R and
LNM-F cells in the parental cell line, LNM-35. We
observed an increase of 60% in the number of cells
of the mix R/F 20/80 compared to LNM-F or LNM-R
culture alone (Figure 1B). Fluorescence activated
cell sorting showed a higher proportion of cells in
S phase and a smaller proportion in G1 phase, as
compared to LNM-F cells cultured alone (Figure
1S C). To confirm the implication of NTSR1 in the
observed growth induction in R/F 20/80, cells were
exposed to BIM 46174 [38], an inhibitor of heterotrimeric
G proteins, SR 48692 [39], a specific NTSR1 antagonist,
and NTS neutralizing antibody. These compounds
abolished the increase of tumor growth observed in the
cell mixture R/F 20/80 (Figure 1C). A contribution of
epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs) to induce
NTS cellular growth was suggested by the abolishing
effect of M475271, a Src kinase inhibitor, AG 1478, a
specific inhibitor of EGFR, and herceptin (trastuzumab),
an antibody specific to HER2, which abrogate the growth

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

enhancement effect (Figure 1D). Chemical inhibitors
confirmed the contribution of NTSR1 and HERs
downstream pathways. Cellular growth amplification
was abolished by a PKC inhibitor, Gö 6976, (Figure
1E), whereas the NO inhibitor, L-NAME, and the PKA
inhibitors, H7, had no effect (Figure 1F). The effect
was also abolished by MEK Inhibitors, U0126 and
PD98059, and the phosphoinositide 3-kinases inhibitor,
the LY294002 (Figure 1E).

The NTS/NTSR1 complex enhances EGFR,
HER2 and HER3 expression and activation
The previous results highlighted a specific effect
of NTS in oncogenic processes occurring through an
interrelation between NTS/NTSR1 and receptor tyrosine
kinase systems. We therefore measured the HERs cellular
protein content in the mixture of R/F 20/80 cells cultured
as previously described. An increase of HER2 and HER3
protein levels, and to a minor extent, EGFR protein levels
was observed (Figure 2A). This effect was abolished
by SR 48692 as shown on gel figure 2B. Surprisingly,
similar mRNA levels were seen for the three receptors
in LNM-R/LNM-F 20/80 as well as LNM-R and LNM-F
cultured alone (Figure 2S). The accumulation of the HERs
protein without transcriptional regulation suggests that the
recycling and degradation of these receptors is altered by
NTS/NTSR1 interaction. This is in line with our previous
findings showing that sustained NTSR1 activation installs
a state of permanent recycling of NTSR1, instead of
agonist induced lysosomal degradation [36].
Western blot analysis of R-SI NTS cells exposed
for 48h to exogenous NTS agonist also showed a marked
increase of HER2 and HER3 protein content. These
increases were totally abolished by SR 48692 treatment
(Figure 2C and inset). No obvious changes was observed,
by immunocytochemistry, in EGFR labeling in R-SI NTS
cells, treated or not with JMV 449. In contrast, HER2
and HER3 staining were more intense at the membrane
and in the cytosol of cell exposed to NTS agonist (Figure
2D). In both experiments, continued exposition to NTS in
cells expressing NTSR1 induced the remodeling of HER2
and HER3 expression associated with more aggressive
phenotype.
To explore if these mechanisms occur in human
tumoral cells, we searched the consecutive slides from
27 specimens with lung adenocarcinoma for clusters of
cells concomitantly labeled for NTS, NSTR1, HER2
and HER3. Concomitant expression was observed in
restrictive areas of 19 specimens, and examples are shown
in figure 2E. However, in 8 other specimens’ concomitant
overexpression could not be observed. These observations
suggest the up regulation of HER2 and HER3 by NTS is
specific of lung tumoral cells.

by HB-EGF would be enhanced by the release of
HB-EGF under the influence of NTS. Similarly, neuregulin
1 (NRG1), a specific ligand for HER3, was found more
intensively released when R-SI NTS cells were treated
with NTS agonist. In LNM-R cells, the NTSR1 antagonist,
SR48692 reduced the amount of NRG1 released in the
culture media. Increased amounts of activated NRG1
sustained the hypothesis of HER3 autocrine regulation
established under NTS exposure (figure 4B). In parallel,
MMP1 was found to be released in the media of R-SI
NTS cells treated with NTS agonist (Figure 4C). In cells
bearing NTS autocrine regulation, MMP1 released was
also decreased in the presence of SR 48692 (Figure 4C).
Several matrix metalloproteases are regulated in
NSCLC including MMP1, which is up regulated in both
adenocarcinomas and squamous cell lung cancer [40].

injecting into the mice. The same rate of tumor growth was
then observed by injecting LNM35 cells (4122 mm3) or
the LNM-F and LNM-R mixture (3782 mm3), as shown
in figure 5A. The tumor weight observed at 28 days postinjection followed the same variation as the tumor volume
(Figure 3S A). NTS and NTSR1 immunohistochemistry
was performed on tumors. The presence of NTSR1 was
seen in both LNM-R and LNM-F tumors (Figure 5B), but
with a granular and irregular intensity of labeling. In order
to better visualize NTS, we used an antibody against a NTS
precursor, which detected the presence of NTS precursor
in LMN-R and its absence in LNM-F tumors (Figure 5B).
We explored the effects of NTS systemic regulation
on the tumor growth enhancement. R-SI NTS cells were
injected subcutaneously into the right flank and R-SI
NTSR1 cells in the left flank of the mice. Figure 5C
shows that the R-SI NTS tumor xenografts reach the
size and weight (Figure 3SB) of the tumors initiated by
the corresponding LMN-R parental cells, whereas R-SI
NTSR1 tumors remain at the same smaller size that was
observed in mice bearing only R-SI NTSR1 xenografts,
suggesting that the circulating NTS produced by the R-SI
NTSR1 tumor enhanced the tumor growth of R-SI NTS
xenografted into the other flank.
We evaluated the relative tumorigenic potential
of the NTS autocrine and/or paracrine regulation. R-SINTS and LNM-R cells were mixed to generate xenografts
bearing autocrine and paracrine NTS regulation as
expressed in the original parental cells LNM35 and in the
mixture LNM-R and LNM-F. Alternatively, we mixed cell
lines not expressing NTS (R-SI NTS and LNM-F cells).
When R-SI NTS and LNM-R cells mixture was injected in
mice, the size of the tumor generated by this heterologous
cell population (4122 mm3) was similar to tumors
generated by the parental LNM35 cells (3885  mm3),
and the mixture of LNM-R and LNM-F (3782  mm3)

NTSR1 activation in experimental tumors
In order to apprehend the contribution of NTSR1 in
lung tumorigenesis, we developed experimental tumors
bearing NTS autocrine, and/or paracrine, or endocrine
regulation. We established the growth rate of LNM35
tumor xenografts in the nude mice, in comparison with
the two derived sub-clones, LNM-R (NTS+) and LNM-F
(NTS-). As shown in figure 5A, LNM35 xenografts
displayed the more drastic tumorigenesis profile with a
final tumor volume of 4122 mm3. The sub-clones LNM-R,
and LNM-F generated smaller tumors with a final volume
of 2582 and 1858 mm3, respectively. The tumor size is
38 and 55% smaller than LNM35 when generated by
LNM-R and LMN-F, respectively. The difference in the
tumor growth rates between the parental cells and the
two subclones suggests a positive cooperativity between
these two cellular populations. To confirm this hypothesis,
we mixed the two subclones at the same density before

(Figure  5D) demonstrating that in all cases, the NTS
autocrine regulation participates with paracrine regulation
to strongly enhance tumor progression. In contrast, when a
mixture of the R-SI NTS and LNM-F cells, not expressing
NTS, was xenografted in nude mice, the tumor volume
was globally 40% smaller than the xenografts bearing
NTS autocrine and paracrine regulation (Figure 5D).
Identical observations were made for the tumor weight
(Figure 3S C). When the cells do not release NTS, there is
no cooperation between cells, and tumor growth is slower.
The overall conclusion of this series of experiments
suggests that NTS participates in enhancing tumor growth
via autocrine, paracrine and systemic pathways.

with advanced NSCLC patients harboring EGFRactivating mutations [41]. Metformin is an antidiabetic
drug, and has recently been proposed as a potential
anticancer compound [42]. Metformin was shown to
disrupt the crosstalk between insulin receptor and NTS
receptor in pancreatic cancer cells [43]. Furthermore,
in addition to inhibiting the mTOR pathway, metformin
prevents ERK activation induced by NTS and insulin [44].

and 612.41 + 104.97 mm3 for metformin treated animals
(P= 0.05 vs control), respectively. Used in co-treatment,
metformin did not improve the response to erlotinib. The
final volume was 318.23 ± 31.56 mm3 (Fig 6 B). The
tumor doubling time was in agreement with the tumor
volume, with 2.87 ± 0.13 days, 3.09 ± 0.07 days, 3.85 ±
0.24 days, and 4.03 ± 0.28 days for the control, metformin,
erlotinib and metformin + erlotinib treated animals,
respectively. The absence of a response of R-SI NTSR1
tumors to erlotinib or metformin, as shown in figure

loop, leading to the sustained activation of EGFR and

the prognostic significance of expression of NTSR1 in a
population of consecutive patients with stage I-III NSCLC
(all histotypes) referred to our institution for surgery.
Firstly, we studied a population of consecutive patients
operated on for NSCLC (all histotypes) between June 15,
2001 and June 14, 2002. Secondly, on the basis of initial
results, only adenocarcinoma patients operated on between
June 15, 2001 and December 31, 2005 were analyzed.
In the first subpopulation (n=271; characteristics
are described in table 1), presence of NTSR1 in more
than 10% of staining cells was detected in 59 % of
cases (160/271), but it was never detected in normal
tissues adjacent to the tumor area. In the NTSR1 semiquantitative evaluation, 111, 126, and 34 patients
were scored as 0, 1 and 2, respectively. In the lung
adenocarcinomas, NTSR1 staining of cancer cells
was granular, intracellular, heterogeneous and rarely
localized at the plasma membrane (figure 7A left). On
the contrary, NTSR1 staining in the squamous carcinoma

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells was often localized at the membrane level (figure 7A
right). Interestingly, NTSR1 positive staining was not
detected in lepidic carcinomas (formerly known as
bronchioloalveolar) or even in the lepidic component of
invasive adenocarcinomas.
NTSR1 score 1 was detected in 48 % of
adenocarcinomas (57/119), 43% of squamous cell
carcinomas (SCC) (46/107), and 39% of large cell
carcinomas (LCC) (14/36). NTSR1 score 2 was detected
in 22% of adenocarcinomas (26/119), 7% of SCC (8/ 107),
and 3% (1/36) of LCC. NTSR1 score 2 was correlated
with adenocarcinoma histological types (p = 0.013), but
not with sex, age, smoking status, stage of disease and
presence of vascular or lymphatic emboli. The prognostic
significance of NTSR1 expression was assessed in 228 of
the 271 patients, due to postoperative deaths (n=20) and
loss at follow-up (n=23). NTSR1 score 2 was associated
with poor 5-year overall survival as compared with
NTSR1 scored 0 or 1 (36.5% [95% CI 22.27% - 53.5%])

8260

patients with adenocarcinomas were analyzed. The NTSR1
score 2 was observed in 19.5 % of patients (76/389).
The correlation between NTSR1 and patient survival
was determined on 363 of the 389 patients. The 5-year
overall survival in this population was 55.3%. 5-year
survival was 71.3%; 54.9%, 38.8%, 32.9% in patients
with pT1, pT2, pT3 and pT4 tumors, respectively (p =
0.0000018). These figures were 65.1%, 50.7%, 34.7% for
pN0, pN1, pN2 disease, respectively (p = 0.0000001). The
NTSR1 score 2 was associated with worse 5-year overall
survival as compared with NTSR1 score 0 and 1 (42.2%
[32.42% - 54.74%] versus 58.5% [52.62% - 64.07%],
p = 0.019) (Figure 7C). Multivariate analysis in all
adenocarcinoma patients showed that pN (p=0.0000001),

versus 55.4% [95% CI 48.2% - 62.31%] respectively,
p = 0.039) (Figure 7B Left). No difference was observed
in survival between patients with NTSR1 score 0 and
those with score 1. Among patients with adenocarcinomas,
NTSR1 score 2 was significantly associated with worse
5-year overall survival as compared with NTSR1 score
0 or 1 (36.1% [95% CI 20.29% - 55.54%] versus 61.2%
[95% CI 50.72% - 70.79%], p=0.028) (Figure 7B center).
In contrast, among patients with either SCC or LCC,
NTSR1 score did not predict survival (Figure 7B right).
The second populations focused only on
adenocarcinoma subtypes. An additional 270 consecutive
patients with adenocarcinoma was added (See patient
baseline characteristics in table 1). Together, a total of 389

degradation-recycling is therefore taking place in the
cells under the influence of NTS. The higher expression
of the HER2 isoform suggests that a larger proportion
of dimers containing HER2 should be activated in the
cell. This context was previously described in breast
cancer cells with HER2 gene amplification. It was shown
that the excess of HER2 intracellular domains impaired
EGFR/HER2 endocytosis [47], by preventing the entry
of activated EGFR into clathrin-coated vesicles and
limiting the action of phosphatases and maintaining EGFR
signaling [48]. In addition, it was also reported that under
HER2 overexpression, the rate of lysosomal targeting was
significantly reduced, and a rapid recycling of activated
EGFR back to the cell surface occurred, as well decreased
ligand dissociation from the EGFR [49]. The necessary
threshold of HER2 expression levels to trigger these
processes is not known.
Interestingly, we show in this report that
NTS chronically activates the release of HB-EGF
concomitantly with neuregulin 1. Consequently, both
EGFR and HER3 autocrine activities are boosted and the
tumoral aggressiveness is potentiated. The contribution
of MMPs and EGF “like” ligands to carcinogenesis and
cancer progression is well known. Therapeutical strategies
targeting these factors have been largely attempted.
However, these factors are also important for many
pathway of the human metabolism, as well as and major
physiological functions, such as healing, angiogenesis,
and gonadogenesis [50], leading to toxic effects when
antagonized. One approach is to specifically antagonize
their effects in cancer cells and to target an upstream
regulatory factor. In this context, the NTS/NTSR1
complex would appear to be convenient, because it is
specifically over-expressed in tumors and its inhibition
should only impair the function of these factors where
they are deleterious. The validity of this concept was
tested with the use of a specific NTSR1 antagonist,
SR 48692, which significantly reduced all of the NTS
induced oncogenic effects [18,51]. The use of new
pharmacological molecules to antagonize or neutralize
intense and constant NTS-NTSR1 activation should
reduce tumor aggressiveness as tumoral cells bearing NTS
and NTSR1 are susceptible to induce sustained activation
of EGFR and HER3 concomitantly, as shown in figure 2E.
The LMN-R cells did not carry activating mutations
in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the EGFR gene that
confers sensitivity to EGFR TKIs. The sustained activation

pT (p=0.00004) and NTSR1 score 2 (p=0.0069) were
independent predictors of worse survival.

DISCUSSION
Genetic defaults carried by tumors, represent
specific biological markers which reveal altered
regulatory pathways. The most well-known examples
include the fusion genes (BCR-ABL and EML4-ALK),
the activating mutations (EGFR, K-RAS, Scr, BRAF),
and genomic amplification (HER2, MET). Accordingly,
specific therapies employing EGFR and HER2 inhibitors
or antibodies have been developed and were shown
to improve the outcome of the disease. In parallel, cell
signaling networks evolve with the accumulation of
genetic and epigenetic alterations in connection with the
local stroma and the immune system. Identification of
contributing factors for tumor cell aggressiveness should
enable to modulate tumor and disease progression.
Here we report that the NTS/NTSR1 complex
contributed to tumor aggressiveness when it is abnormally
over-expressed in tumors. The sustained activation of the
NTS/NTSR1 complex generated cellular modifications
resulting in the overexpression and continued stimulation
of epidermal growth factor receptors. A similar result
was detected using breast cancer cells. When injected
into nude mice, we observed an increase in tumor growth
and metastasis emergence from cells expressing NTS and
NTSR1 as compared to cells expressing NTSR1 alone.
The breast cells and the experimental tumors expressing
NTS also displayed an increase in EGFR, HER2, and
HER3 expression and activation. The latter effect was
correlated with an increase of Hb-EGF, Neuregulin 2, and
MMP9 [55].
Our experimental studies have shown that the NTS
oncogenic action is boosted with a sustained NTSR1
state of activation. In human tumors, both NTS and
NTSR1 are expressed in 40%, 60%, 65%, and 80 % of
breast and lung cancers, mesotheliomas, and head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas, respectively, suggesting
that autocrine and/or paracrine NTS regulation occurs
in tumors [32,45,46]. Sustained activation of NTSR1
induced the overexpression of the two receptors HER2,
and HER3, as well as an autocrine activation of EGFR,
HER2 and HER3. The transcriptional level of these
three receptors was not altered by NTS, suggesting that

CONCLUSION

of EGFR caused by a NTS/NTSR1 autocrine loop,
mimics the effects seen by activating EGFR mutations. As
expected, the tumors expressing the NTS/NTRS1 complex
are responsive to erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor given to
patients with lung cancer bearing EGFR mutations [10].
In contrast, tumors void of NTSR1 expression and borne
by the same mice were not responsive to erlotinib. No
additional responses were seen with the concomitant
treatment of metformin and erlotinib, confirming the
hypothesis that the signaling events are in the same
cascade.
We previously found that NTSR1 expression is
associated with adenocarcinomas prognosis. This result
was confirmed by multivariate analysis, which showed
that among the available clinical and pathologic factors,
the NTSR1 score 2, T, and N were independent predictors
of worse prognosis. High expression of NTSR1 has been
found to be associated to poor survival also in other
cancers. Dupouy et al found that NTSR1 expression
involving ≥ 80% tumor cells was associated with worse
survival in breast cancer [51]. Similarly, in head and neck
cancers, patients with high NTS and NTSR1 expression
had a higher rate of distant metastasis [46]. Therefore, the
prognostic role of the NTS system is probably correlated
with its activation rate. In this context, the difference
in staining between the different histological subtypes
in our series explains the respective prognostic role of
NTSR1. Within adenocarcinomas, NTSR1 staining was
never detected in bronchioloalveolar subtypes or in the
bronchioloalveolar component of mixed adenocarcinoma
but it was often detected in its invasive compartment,
suggesting a role favoring tumor invasion and migration.
In SCC the staining was found primarily at the membrane
as in the non-stimulated cells and was non associated with
survival. In vitro studies have shown that NTS is capable
of modulating the migratory ability of adherent cancer
cells of different origins (colon, ductal pancreatic, head
and neck squamous cell, breast). In addition, it has been
showed that NTSR1 induces and enhances the invasive
phenotype in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) and HNSCC
tumor cells. Involved mechanisms remain unclear but
metalloproteinase are probably involved [46,52].
The NTS/NTSR1 complex could be used as a marker
to identify subsets of human cancers, and thus make
eligible new drugs, kinase inhibitors, or immunotherapy,
targeting HERs protein or their downstream pathways.
The clinical criteria used to propose these therapies are
based on the detection of genetic defaults in the tumor
(HER2 amplification, EGFR mutation). Nevertheless, it
was also observed that other patient subsets could benefit
from these therapies. The challenge is find a criteria to
categorize them. For example, cells with neuregulin 1 high
expression in association with HER3 autocrine activation
and without HER2 amplification, are good responders to
lapatinib or HER2 kinase inhibitors [53].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our findings implicate the NTS/NTSR1 complex
as a contributor to cancer aggressiveness by enhancing
concomitantly the expression and activation of three
receptors EGFR, HER2, HER3. Presently, only EGFR
mutated tumors are eligible to receive EGFR TKI,
representing 10 % of all lung cancer patients [54].
From our findings, we propose that patients bearing this
complex should be responders to kinase inhibitors, and
that inhibition of NTS/NTSR1 complex should reduce the
rate of tumor progression, providing a longer therapeutic
window for the practitioners to treat their patients.
Accordingly, our results indicate that an additional 20%
of patient might benefit for these therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture procedures
The LNM35 cell line was sub-cloned by limiting
dilution, after few days of culture, clones containing
exclusively flat or rounded cells were saved and were
named LNM-F for Flat, LNM-R for Rounded. All cells
were grown at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2.

Cell proliferation assays
20 000 cells/well of lung cancer cells were seeded in
24-well culture plates. Medium was replaced by FCS-free
medium in presence or absence of NTS or JMV449 10-8M.
Cells were counted after 5 days of treatment with a particle
count and size analyzer (Z1 Coulter Particle Counter,
Beckman Coulter). For LNM-F/LNM-R (20/80 %) cell
mixture: Cells were seeded in 48-well culture plates at a
concentration of 40 000 cells/well, media containing 10%
FCS. Media is changed 24h after for a media containing
0.1% FCS cells are counted after 48 hours.

Western blots
2x106 cells were grown for 72h then serumstarved for 48h in a phenol red-free medium in presence
or absence of different concentrations of 5x10-6 M SR
48692 and 25x10-9M MMP inhibitor (Calbiochem),
and lysed (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, 0,5 % NP40, 0.5 % glycerol, 1 mM PMSF,
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail) at 4°C for
30 min. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight
at 4°C according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Total anti-EGFR (1:500), anti-phospho-EGFR (1:500),
anti-phospho-HER2 (1:500), anti-HER3 (1:2000), antiphospho-HER3 (1:1000) were from Cell Signaling
Technology. Total anti-HER2 (1:2000) was purchased

from Neomarkers and anti-βactin (1:50000) from Sigma.
Secondary anti-rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or
anti-mouse (Sigma) antibodies, conjugated to HRP, were
used at 1:2000 dilutions for 1h at room temperature
and visualised by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE
Healthcare).

A two-step procedure was followed. Firstly, we
studied a population of consecutive patients operated on
for NSCLC (all histotypes, including adenocarcinoma) in
the Thoracic Surgery Dpt of the Hôtel-Dieu Hospital, Paris,
France between June 15, 2001 and June 14, 2002. Secondly,
on the basis of initial results, only adenocarcinoma patients
operated on between June 15, 2001 and December 31,
2005 were analyzed. Patient characteristics, treatment
procedures, and short-term and long-term outcomes were
retrospectively collected using a standardized case report
form. Furthermore, a centralized pathological blind revision
of the samples was performed by two expert pathologists
(D.D., A.L.). In this revision, histologic subtype was
determined on the basis of the new International Association
for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/
European Respiratory Society classification.
Adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy was
performed under the care of referring physicians, so no
uniform protocol was employed. Long-term outcome was
assessed by direct telephone interviews with patient or
family (in case of deceased patients). When no clinical
follow-up was available, information on vital status was
obtained through the municipality of birth of the patient.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients. The
research was conducted according to recommendations
outlined in the Helsinki declaration. Institutional Review
Board approval was obtained (CPP Ile de France II, 2012).

Immunofluorescence assays
Cells were seeded on 12 mm-diameter glass slides
for 24 hours, fixed in 5 % paraformaldehyde for 1 hour
at room temperature, permeabilized in PBS /0.5 % Triton
X-100 for 30 min and saturated for 20 min in PBS+
(1:100 (m/v) BSA, 1:250 (v/v) cold fish skin gelatin in
PBS 1X, pH 8.0). Cells were then incubated overnight at
4 °C with the primary antibody diluted to 1:100 in PBS
0.1 % Triton X-100. NTS immunoreactivity was detected
using a rabbit polyclonal anti-NTS immunoglobulin
(NA1230, Tebu-Bio) and NTSR1 with a goat polyclonal
antibody directed against the human COOH terminus of
the receptor (C20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Slides
were incubated for 1 hour with a fluorescent secondary
antibody (1:100) : a cyanin3 anti-rabbit immunoglobulin
or a FITC-coupled anti-rabbit or goat immunoglobulin
(Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclei were counterstained
for 5 min with DAPI 1:50000.

Tumor xenografts
Lung cancer cell xenografts were initiated in nude
mice by subcutaneous injection of 106 cells of LNM35,
LNM-F, LNM-R, or derivative cell clones. For tumors
generated from a cell mixture, 106 cells from each clone
were plated together 72 hours prior to injection. Four to
six series were performed; each series included 5-8 mice.
All procedures were in accordance with the “Guide of the
Care and Use of laboratory Animals”.
For drug treatments, 106 of LNM-R or R-SI NTSR1
cells (LNM-R expressing sh-RNA for NTSR1) were
injected into nude mice by subcutaneous injection, R-SI
NTSR1 cells in the right flank and LNM-R cells in the
left flank. 7 days after injection, 4 groups of 9 mice were
randomized on the size of LNM-R as follows: 19.79 ±
3.00 mm3 for control group, 18.66 ± 2.21 mm3 for erlotinib
group, 16.82 ± 3.32 mm3 for metformin group and 18.82
± 3.00 mm3 for metformin and elotinib group. Mice
were treated for 17 days per os, with water, or 25 mg/
kg erlotinib, or 200 mg/kg metformin or both. A second
experiment was performed 15 days after injection of R-SI
NTSR1 cells. Four groups of 10 mice were randomized
as follows: 161.37 ± 29.13 mm3 for control group, 129.19
± 20.89 mm3 for erlotinib group, 152.76 ± 27.86 mm3 for
metformin group and 145.30 ± 23.4 mm3 for metformin
and erlotinib group. Mice were treated for 24 days per os,
with water, or 25 mg/kg erlotinib, or 200 mg/kg
metformin, or both.

Immunohistochemistry
Procedure is detailed in SI. For all cases histologic
slides of primary tumors were obtained from paraffin
wax embedded tissues. Standard H&E staining was
used to ensure the tumoral character of the specimen.
Deparaffinized tissue sections (4 µm) were incubated at
4°C overnight with primary antibody included anti-NTS
(1:200, SC-20806, Santa Cruz biotechnology®), antiNTSR1 (1:100; C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology®) and
anti-ErbB3 (1:50, NCL-c-erbB-3, Novocastra™), and
anti-ErbB2 (1:400, A0485, Dako) was incubated at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
For prognosis evaluation, all specimens were
scored by an anatomopathologist with special interest in
pulmonary pathology (DD). NTSR1 staining of cancer
cells was scored as positive in the presence of staining cells
> 10 %. Semi-quantitative evaluation was also performed:
0: no staining; 2: more than 50% of tumor cell showing a
positive stain of high intensity; 1: intermediate cases.

Test : ***P<0.001,**P<0.01, and *P<0.05. For human
studies, data processing and analysis were performed with
the statistical software system SEM (SILEX Development,
Mireffleurs, France). Correlations were carried out by
the Spearman rank correlation or H-test, as appropriate.
Survival analysis was carried out by the Kaplan-Meier
method, and univariate comparisons of curves were
performed using log rank tests. Risk factors associated
with outcomes in univariate analysis with a p value <0.05
were entered into a multivariate Cox model analysis, to
identify independent predictors of survival. A p value of
less than 0.05 was considered significant.

NTS Radioimmunoassay (RIA)
RIA was performed on culture media from one
million cells were grown in 60 mm2 Petri dishes for 24, 48,
or 72 hours. RIA was performed as previously described
Scarceriaux V et al Endocrinology 1995;136:2554-60, and
detailed in Alifano M et al Clin Cancer Res 2010;16:4401-10.

Flow cytometry
The assessment of the G1 and S phases of cell cycle
on LNM-R, LNM-F and LNM-F/LNM-R mixtures were
conducted using IP tests. 40 000 cells were seeded in
48-wells culture plates in complete medium. After 24 hours,
medium was replaced by 0.1% FCS-counting medium.
The cells were pelleted, 500 µL of 1nM IP was added to
solubilize the pellet and incubated at 37°C during 10 min.

Additional Methods

Immunohistochemistry

In order to confirm that both cell types were from the
same origin, microsatellite analysis was performed using
D17S250 and D17S513, which showed identical patterns
for LNM-R, LNM-F and LNM35 (data not shown).

Deparaffinized TMA sections (4 µm) were
subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate
buffer (pH 6.0). The sections were labeled for the target
proteins using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex
method. The slides were incubated at 4°C overnight with
primary antibody included anti-NTS (1:200, SC-20806,
Santa Cruz biotechnology®) and anti-ErbB3 (1:50,
NCL-c-erbB-3, Novocastra™), anti-NTSR1 (1:100; C20,
Santa CruzBiotechnology®) and anti-ErbB2 (1:400,
A0485, Dako) were incubated at room temperature for
1 hour and 30 minutes respectively. These slides were
then incubated with appropriate biotinylated secondary
antibodies, NTS (Trekkie Biotinylates rabbit link,
Biocare medical®), NTSR1 (Biotinylated anti-goat IgG,

RT-PCR and quantitative PCR
1µg of total RNA was subjected to reverse
transcription, during 1 hour at 37 °C, using 1 µg of
nonspecific hexameric random primers dN, 1mM dNTP,
10 mM dithiothreitol, 24 units RNaseOUT and 200 units of
M-MLV-RT enzyme (Invitrogen). The PCR amplification
was performed on 1:10 (v/v) of the 1:10-diluted reverse
transcription reaction using 0.2 mM dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2

complex was revealed with avidin-biotinperoxidase
complex, according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
NTSR1 (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector laboratories,
Inc.), NTS and ErbB3 (Trekavidin- HPR label, Biocare
medical®). ErbB2 was biotinylated and revealed with
the NovoLink™ Polymer Detection System (Leica®).
NTSR1 and ErbB2 staining were done with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochlorid, NTS and ErbB3 were
done with aminoethyl carbazole. All slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin.
For prognosis evaluation, NTSR1 immunoreactivity
was detected using a specific antibody against the
carboxy terminus of NTSR1 (1:100; C-20, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). These sections were then incubated
with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:100; Vector
laboratories, Inc). The antigen-antibody complex was
revealed with avidin-biotinperoxidase complex, according
to the manufacturer's instructions for the Vectastain ABC
Kit (Vector laboratories, Inc.). Staining was done with
