Abstract
Daunorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic agent used in
the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. Toxicities
associated with this agent include myelosuppression and
cardiotoxicity; however, the genes or genetic determinants
that contribute to these toxicities are unknown. We present
an unbiased genome-wide approach that incorporates heritability, whole-genome linkage analysis, and linkage-directed
association to uncover genetic variants contributing to the
sensitivity to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. Cell growth
inhibition in 324 Centre d’ Etude du Polymorphisme Humain
lymphoblastoid cell lines (24 pedigrees) was evaluated following treatment with daunorubicin for 72 h. Heritability analysis
showed a significant genetic component contributing to the
cytotoxic phenotypes (h 2 = 0.18–0.63 at 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1,
0.2, and 1.0 Mmol/L daunorubicin and at the IC50, the dose
required to inhibit 50% cell growth). Whole-genome linkage
scans at all drug concentrations and IC50 uncovered 11 regions
with moderate peak LOD scores (>1.5), including 4q28.2 to
4q32.3 with a maximum LOD score of 3.18. The quantitative
transmission disequilibrium tests were done using 31,312 highfrequency single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located in
the 1 LOD confidence interval of these 11 regions. Thirty genes
were identified as significantly associated with daunorubicininduced cytotoxicity (P V 2.0  104, false discovery rate V 0.1).
Pathway and functional gene ontology analysis showed that
these genes were overrepresented in the phosphatidylinositol
signaling system, axon guidance pathway, and GPI-anchored
proteins family. Our findings suggest that a proportion of
susceptibility to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity may be
controlled by genetic determinants and that analysis using
linkage-directed association studies with dense SNP markers
can be used to identify the genetic variants contributing to
cytotoxicity. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5425–33]

Introduction
Daunorubicin is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment
of hematopoietic malignancies, such as acute lymphocytic and
acute myelogenous leukemia, as well as some lymphomas and
breast cancer (1). There are several proposed mechanisms of
daunorubicin, most notably DNA intercalation, with a preference

for dGdC-rich regions flanked by A/T basepairs (2). Daunorubicin
has also been shown to inhibit DNA topoisomersase II by trapping
DNA strand passage intermediates, eventually resulting in DNA
single-strand and double-strand breaks. Recent studies have shown
that the formation of DNA-anthracycline complexes can significantly modify the ability of the helicases to separate DNA into
single strands in an ATP-dependent fashion, thereby hindering
the process of strand separation and limiting replication (3). There
are also reports that this drug can inhibit protein kinase C
pathways (4). Patients often initially respond but then relapse due
to resistance mechanisms, such as P-170 glycoprotein–mediated
drug efflux, altered topoisomerase II activity, or overexpression of
bcl-2 (5).
The cumulative and dose-dependent toxicities that have limited
the usage of daunorubicin are myelosuppression, mucositis, and
cardiotoxicity (6–8). The risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is 10% to 26% and is dependent primarily on dose (9, 10).
Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is thought to be mediated
through reactive oxygen species production. Experiments conducted on rat cardiomyocytes have shown that corticosterone can
inhibit apoptosis induced by doxorubicin, a structural analogue of
daunorubicin. This effect was mediated by the regulation of
multiple genes, including antioxidant/detoxification enzymes,
receptors, signaling molecules, and amino acid and protein
synthesis (11). Furthermore, Yi et al. have identified significant
gene expression changes in mice after doxorubicin treatment,
including a series of genes that encode oxidative stress-related
proteins, signal transduction, and apoptotic proteins (12). Matrix
metalloproteinases 2 and 9 expression levels were enhanced in mice
after acute doxorubicin treatment (13). In humans, tumor necrosis
factor a and phospholipase C-y1 have been shown to be critical in
doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (14). The genes important in
daunorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity have not been well studied.
In this report, we used classic and modern genetic approaches to
identify genes that contribute to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. To this end, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from
large Centre d’ Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) reference
pedigrees of Northern and Western European descent were used to
identify the extent to which heritable factors contribute to drug
cytotoxicity. There have been candidate gene approaches to study
the cellular sensitivity of daunorubicin in multiple tumor cell lines
(15–19). However, our approach uses whole-genome linkage
analysis and linkage-directed association studies to facilitate
identifying regions within the genome that harbor genes contributing to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity.

Materials and Methods

purchased from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research4 (Camden, NJ).
Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech) supplemented with
15% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% L-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cell
lines were passaged thrice per week at a concentration of 350,000 cells/mL
and kept at a temperature of 37jC, with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.
Drug. Daunorubicin (NSC-82151) was kindly provided by the Drug
Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment, National
Cancer Institute (NCI), Bethesda, MD.
Cell cytotoxicity assay. Cell growth inhibition was evaluated at
concentrations of 0, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 Amol/L daunorubicin.
These concentrations were selected through assay optimization over a large
range of daunorubicin treatment concentrations. We chose the daunorubicin
concentrations within the limits of our assay that best characterized the
sigmoid shape of cell growth inhibition. Daunorubicin was prepared in PBS
(pH 7.4; Invitrogen) immediately before use. The cytotoxic effect of
daunorubicin on these CEPH cell lines was determined using the nontoxic
colorimetric-based assay, alamarBlue (Biosource). Cell viability was assessed
on exponentially growing LCLs by trypan blue dye exclusion using the Vi-Cell
XR viability analyzer (Beckman Coulter). Cells (100 AL) with viabilities of
>85% were plated at a density of 1  105 cells/mL (1  104 cells per well), in
triplicate, in 96-well round-bottomed plates (Corning). After 24 h incubation, cells were treated with either vehicle (media contains 0.1% PBS) or
increasing concentrations of daunorubicin for 72 h. At 72-h incubation
time, untreated cells were in exponential growth. AlamarBlue was added
24 h before absorbance reading at wavelengths 570 and 600 nm using the
Synergy-HT multidetection plate reader (BioTek). Percentage survival was
quantified using manufacturer’s protocol.5 Final percentage survival was
averaged from at least six replicates from two independent experiments.
Additionally, the drug concentration required to inhibit 50% of cell growth
(IC50) was determined for each cell line. Unsupervised, global hierarchical
clustering was done on the daunorubicin cytotoxic phenotypes with
percentage survival data for each cell line using the complete linkage method,
as implemented in the Partek Genomics Solution software (Partek Inc.).
Heritability analysis. Heritability analysis was done using Sequential
Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines (SOLAR)6 to estimate narrow sense
heritability (h 2) and test its significance at each treatment concentration.
This analysis allowed us to quantify the proportion of inherited factors
contributing to human LCL variation in sensitivity to daunorubicin. SOLAR
uses likelihood ratio tests to evaluate heritability by comparing a purely
polygenic model with a sporadic model in the case of testing heritability
(20). All phenotype data were transformed using the inverse normalization
of the percentile rank function in Microsoft Excel software. Covariates,
such as age, sex, and age  sex interaction, were tested in the heritability
model. Sex-specific heritability was also analyzed by setting the phenotypes
for one gender to unknown and analyzing the heritability for the other
gender. The significance of differences in male and female heritability
was assessed through randomly permuting male and female genders,
keeping the numbers of males and females within a pedigree constant,
and performing the sex-specific heritability analysis in each replicate.
Error checking. Error checking for Mendelian incompatibility, misspecified relationships, and unlikely recombinations has been done as
described previously (21); however, this study used a much denser map. The
web-based platform integrates and formats data (pedigree, genotype,
phenotype) and executes error checking using PedCheck (22) to detect
genotypic incompatibilities, PREST (23) to detect relationship misspecifications and multipoint engine for rapid likelihood inference (MERLIN)7 (24)
to detect unlikely recombinants before linkage analysis and is enabled to
run linkage analysis on multiple platforms including MERLIN, GENEHUNTER, and SOLAR. From the combined pool of genotyped markers,
7,209 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellite nonredundant markers yielding a very dense genetic map with highly

heterozygous markers (heterozygosity: 1% at <0.7, 7% at 0.7–0.8, 28% at
0.8–0.9, 64% at 0.9–1) were used for linkage mapping studies.
Linkage analysis. The genotypic data and map distances were
downloaded from the CEPH Version 9 database and the Marshfield map
database8 using error-checked markers. MERLIN was used to perform
nonparametric linkage analysis because it is robust to nonnormal
distributions. For quantitative traits, MERLIN uses the following definitions:
SðvÞ ¼ f founder alleles Sallele ðvÞ2 ;
Sallele ðvÞ ¼ f all carriers of allele ðyi  lÞ:
The score for each inheritance vector S(v) is calculated by summing squared
scores for each founder allele. The score for each founder allele is calculated by
summing the mean deviates (yi  l) for all individuals who carry the founder
allele, in which yi is the phenotype for individual i, l is the population mean,
and v is the list of individuals who carry a particular founder allele. Inheritance
vectors are used to construct a likelihood ratio test for linkage.
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms. From the online CEU dataset in the
HapMap project (release 21)9, 31,312 high-frequency SNPs covering 1,278
genes within the 1 LOD confidence interval of linkage regions with LOD
scores of >1.5 were retrieved. To prevent possible genotyping errors, we
excluded the SNPs with Mendelian transmission errors. Remaining SNPs
used were those with three genotypes and two counts per genotype in the
60 unrelated parents of the trios.
Association analysis. Eighty-six HapMap CEU samples (of 90) were
phenotyped for daunorubicin sensitivity. Three samples (GM11839,
GM12716, and GM12717) were not phenotyped due to the inability to
grow the cells above 85% viability. Additionally, another sample (GM12236)
was not available from Coriell at the time of the experiment. The
cytotoxicity values of HapMap CEU cell lines, as part of the CEPH pedigrees,
were also transformed using the inverse normalization of the percentile
rank function in Microsoft Excel software. Population stratification and
total association between the selected 31,312 SNPs and percentage cell
survival at 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 Amol/L daunorubicin and the
IC50 was done using the QTDT program. Gender was used as a covariate to
adjust for the normalized cytotoxicity values. False discovery rate (FDR)
procedure was used to control for multiple testing within each cytotoxic
phenotype using R statistics software10 (25).
Gene ontology classification and pathway analysis. Gene ontology
categories and KEGG pathways11 were determined using DAVID12 (20).
DAVID determines overrepresentation by comparing the positive genes to
the tested genes in the linkage regions using the one-tailed Fisher exact test.

Results
Cell cytotoxicity and heritability analysis. Using a short-term
cytotoxicity assay, 324 CEPH LCLs derived from 24 three-generation
CEPH Utah pedigrees were exposed to increasing concentrations of
daunorubicin (0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 Amol/L). These
families also contained a subset of 86 HapMap CEU which were
used for the association analyses. The mean (FSD) percentage of
survival decreased from 82.7 F 13.4 to 11.4 F 4.8 after 72 h after
exposure to 0.0125 to 1 Amol/L daunorubicin (Table 1). The mean
and median concentration required to inhibit 50% cell growth
(IC50) for these 324 cell lines were 0.051 and 0.046 Amol/L,
respectively. These values were within the range of the IC50’s
determined for a panel of NCI60 human tumor cell lines13 treated
with daunorubicin (range, 0.003–1.58 Amol/L; mean, 0.084 Amol/L).

*Data are presented as mean F SD from either 324 LCLs in 24 three-generation CEPH families or 30 HapMap CEU trios.

The frequency distributions of the percentage cell growth inhibition after daunorubicin treatment for the 324 cell lines are shown
in Supplementary Fig. S1. Six phenotypes (percentage cell survival
at 0.0125, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 Amol/L daunorubicin and IC50 for
324 LCLs) were not normally distributed (P < 0.05) based on
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, whereas percentage survival after
0.025 Amol/L daunorubicin treatment was normally distributed.
All phenotype data were transformed using the inverse normalization of the percentile rank function in Microsoft Excel software.
The variations of the cytotoxic phenotypes within and between
24 CEPH families are illustrated as boxplots and are shown in
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2. There were significant genetic
contributions to all seven cytotoxic phenotypes (h 2 = 0.18–0.63;
Table 1). The heritability for the IC50 (0.051 F 0.048 Amol/L)
phenotype was 0.29 (P = 8  107). There were no sex-specific

heritability effects for any of the daunorubicin phenotypes (data
not shown).
Linkage analysis. Nonparametric linkage analysis was done on
seven daunorubicin phenotypes using 7,209 high heterozygous
SNPs and microsatellite markers. Drug cytotoxicity is a multigenic
trait; therefore, LOD of >1.5 was chosen in an attempt to be
inclusive of genes that may contribute to a small extent. The
findings from MERLIN multipoint analyses, in which LOD scores
exceeded 1.5, are summarized in Table 2. Among the seven
phenotypes, there were 11 linkage peaks with a maximum LOD
score of larger than 1.5 (Supplementary Fig. S3). The highest LOD
score (3.18) that reached genome-wide significance was located on
4q28.2 to 4q32.3 for the 0.05 Amol/L daunorubicin treatment
phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S3, peak D and Fig. 2). It is worth
noting that this region also contained suggestive LOD scores for

other phenotypes corresponding to 0.025, 0.1, and 0.2 Amol/L and
IC50 daunorubicin phenotypes with LOD scores of 1.72, 2.53, 1.91,
and 2.05, respectively (Fig. 2). This implies that the same linkage
region confer sensitivity to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in
all concentrations except the highest and lowest concentration.
Examination of the linkage peaks associated with the lowest
daunorubicin treatment concentration revealed a peak with a
maximum LOD score of 2.11 at 16q23.1 to 16q24.1 (Supplementary
Fig. S3, peak K and Fig. 3), extending from 104 to 118 Mb of
chromosome 16. This concentration-dependent phenomenon is
further supported by a hierarchical cluster view of the seven
daunorubicin phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. S4). Two major
distinguishable groups are formed between the two lowest
daunorubicin concentrations (0.0125 and 0.025 Amol/L) and higher
concentrations including IC50. The middle daunorubicin concentrations (IC50, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 Amol/L) were more closely clustered
together within the subgroup. Not surprisingly, unique genes are
associated with the lowest concentration of daunorubicin,
suggesting that genetic contribution to drug cytotoxicity varies
with drug concentration.
Association results. The association studies were done using
the percentage survival data from seven daunorubicin phenotypes
and 31,312 SNPs in the 1 LOD confidence interval of the 11 linkage
regions (Table 2). These SNPs are located throughout 1,278 genes.
Using an FDR threshold of 10%, a total of 137 SNPs from 30 genes
were shown to be significantly associated with daunorubicin
cytotoxic phenotypes (P V 2  104, FDR V 0.1; see Table 3 and
Supplementary Table S1). An intronic SNP (rs978752) of INPP4B
in the chromosome 4 linkage peak is associated with multiple
concentrations of daunorubicin (0.1 Amol/L, P = 2  104, FDR =
0.1; 0.2 Amol/L, P = 4  105, FDR = 0.22; 1 Amol/L, P = 3  105,
FDR = 0.66; Fig. 2). The genotype CC of SNP rs978752 (INPP4B) is
correlated with greater cell sensitivity to 1 Amol/L daunorubicin
(Fig. 2) and with other daunorubicin concentrations (0.1 and
0.2 Amol/L; Supplementary Table S1). As shown in Fig. 3, multiple
intronic SNPs of CDH13 in the chromosome 16 linkage peak
are significantly associated with 0.0125 Amol/L daunorubicin
(P V 2  104, FDRV 0.1). SNP rs1862831 AA genotype is
associated with greater cell sensitivity to 0.0125 Amol/L daunorubicin–induced cytotoxicity. The linkage-directed association study
in HapMap CEU resulted in significant associations in 9 of
11 linkage regions (Table 3). The two linkage regions that did
not result in significant association signals were at 6p12.3 to
6q14 (LOD, 1.58) and 8q24 to 8q24.2 (LOD, 1.68) for 0.05 and
0.0125 Amol/L daunorubicin, respectively.
Pathway analysis. Using 1,278 genes in 1 LOD confidence
interval of 11 linkage regions as the background, the 30 genes that
were significantly associated with daunorubicin cytotoxic phenotypes were imported for gene ontology and KEGG pathway
analysis. The results showed that phosphatidylinositol signaling
system (P = 0.034; PIK3R1 and INPP4B), GPI-anchored proteins
(P = 0.027; CDH13, GPC5, and LSAMP), and axon guidance pathway
(P = 0.06; NGEF and SLIT3) were significantly or marginally
overrepresented in the candidate gene list (Table 3).

Discussion
Identification of genetic variants that predict chemotherapeutic
outcome is critical for the design of individualized therapy. With
enriched publicly available resources of marker genotypes9,14,15 and
gene transcriptional levels16, the LCL system has been used in the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

mapping of genetic variants influencing cell response to IR-induced
stress (26), cytotoxicity (21, 27), and variation in mRNA expression
level (28). In the current study, we found that daunorubicininduced cytotoxicity is a highly heritable trait, and there are genetic
variants associated with this trait. Our approach decreased
multiple testing problems inherent with whole-genome association
studies by limiting the association studies to genomic regions
identified through linkage analysis. Instead of testing 3.2 million
SNPs throughout the genome, only 31,312 SNPs representing
1,281 genes within linkage regions (LOD z 1.5) were tested, with
30 genes showing significant association with cellular susceptibility
to daunorubicin.
The present study strongly suggests that sensitivity to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity is a polygenic trait with different genes
contributing at different concentrations of drug. The fluctuation
of estimated heritability values at differing drug concentrations
suggests that genetic components contributing to human variation
in daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity are dose dependent. Linkage
peaks differing at low versus high drug concentrations further
imply that some genes are likely turned on at lower concentrations
of drug, whereas others contribute to variation in susceptibility to
cytotoxicity at higher dosages. This is in agreement with previous
work demonstrating that cell-cycle arrest and cell death follow
distinct pathways depending on the daunorubicin concentration
(19) and other investigators showing higher daunorubicin doses
correlating to more rapid caspase-3 induction (29). Our hierarchical cluster view of the seven daunorubicin phenotypes further
support this concept with midrange drug concentration treatment
effects clustering together, whereas the percentage cell survival
at the highest and lowest concentration exhibit distinguishable
patterns.
To date, candidate gene approaches have focused on genes that
most likely play a role in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of daunorubicin. However, evaluation of a genetic
polymorphism within the multidrug resistance 1 gene, whose
expression correlated to daunorubicin resistance (30) in acute
myeloid leukemia cell lines showed a negative correlation between
this polymorphism and response to doxorubicin, an analogue of
daunorubicin (31). In addition, association studies conducted for
genetic variants located in topoisomersase II, c-raf, bcl-2, and p53,
whose expression correlates with resistance to anthracyclines (32),
also yielded negative results (33, 34). There are several reasons for
these discrepancies, including the multigenic nature of sensitivity
of cells to drugs and the cell-specific nature of these candidate
genes. Our whole-genome approach, which makes no a priori
assumptions and gives equal weight to all genes, would more likely
identify genetic polymorphism signatures that are important to
daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. These signatures include all
SNPs within the 30 genes identified using our linkage-directed
association studies.
Dolan et al. (21) and Watters et al. (27) have shown that
sensitivity to cytotoxicity induced by cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and
docetaxel are heritable traits, which might be influenced by many
low penetrance genes. The present study differs from these
previously published studies in several ways: (a) the present
analysis reports heritability, linkage, and association studies of

daunorubicin; (b) the power of the linkage scan is enhanced by a
significant increase in the sample size (24 pedigrees) and the
marker density (7,209 markers), compared with 10 pedigrees and
1,784 markers in our previous study (21); (c) association studies
were not done in previous studies, whereas the present analysis
includes linkage-directed association studies using trios that are
part of the HapMap CEU cell lines, thereby providing dense SNP
coverage; (d) pathway and gene ontology analysis was done,
showing that genes associated with daunorubicin cytotoxicity were
overrepresented in phosphatidylinositol signaling system consistent with literature evidence (35), axon guidance pathway, and GPIanchored proteins family.
Our linkage-directed association analyses identified 30 genes
showing significant association with cellular susceptibility to
daunorubicin and located under the linkage peaks. Although all
30 genes are considered equally important, the SNPs located within
PIK3R1 and INPP4B and corresponding phosphatidylinositol
signaling pathway is of considerable interest. The phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway involves the metabolism of inositol
lipids. The lipid products, such as phosphatidylinositol-3,4biphosphate and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, have
been shown to interact with a large variety of downstream
effectors, including serine-threonine kinase Akt (36). It was
observed that daunorubicin could stimulate the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt-mediated survival pathway in human
acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (37); and PI3K has been shown to
protect cells from another anthracycline, doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis (38). PIK3R1 encodes the 85 kDa regulatory subunit of
PI3K, which was reported to be involved in generating the
antiapoptotic and chemoresistant phenotype associated with
accelerated local tumor recurrence (39). INPP4B encoding inositol
polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II is also involved in phospha-

tidylinositol signaling pathways. Our genetic analysis identifying
the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, particularly PI3K,
is consistent with literature evidence demonstrating that the
pathway contributes to protection from daunorubicin-induced
cytotoxicity (38).
The utility of daunorubicin is limited by a dose-dependent
cardiotoxicity (10) that can lead to long-term side effects and
severe morbidity (8). In a study on childhood leukemia, nearly 60%
of 115 survivors had echocardiographic abnormalities in heart
function (40). Attempts to reduce anthracycline cardiotoxicity
have been directed toward dose and schedule modification,
developing less cardiotoxic analogues and concurrently administering cardioprotective agents to attenuate the effects of
anthracyclines on the heart (41); however, the genetic basis of
anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is largely unknown. Although
our unbiased genetic model uses lymphoblastoid, not cardiac,
cells, the ultimate goal is to identify variants that predispose an
individual to the toxicities associated with daunorubicin. Of the
30 genes we identified in LCLs, 19 were also expressed in human
cardiac tissue as shown in a gene expression study17 carried out
by Shumueli et al. (42). The model provides genetic leads that can
be evaluated in the appropriate tissue of toxicity, such as cardiac.
Particular genes of interest that are expressed in the heart include
CDH13, a member of the cadherin superfamily, encoding a
putative mediator of cell-cell interaction in the heart, although
any of the identified genes or combination of genes could be
important.
Although the full implications and biological significance of
other genes and networks identified through our approach are not

yet completely understood, they may serve as a platform to further
explore relevant mechanisms and improve the understanding of
the molecular basis of daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, this study also highlights similarities and differences among
seven daunorubicin cytotoxic phenotypes at the molecular level.
Because family studies cannot be done in unaffected individuals,
human LCLs represent our best in vitro model with extensive

genotypic information in the public domain. We recognize
limitations, such as differences in expression and posttranslational
modification of genes in various tissues.
In summary, using heritability analysis and whole-genome
linkage scan with linkage-directed association studies, we provide
a balanced approach to decipher the genetic factors contributing
to chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. Our data suggests that

genetic factors contribute to cytotoxicity to a greater degree at
lower concentrations of daunorubicin indicating the relative
contribution of genetic factors and environment may vary
depending on the dosage of daunorubicin. Three overrepresented
pathways and 30 genes are associated with the daunorubicininduced cytotoxicity in the linkage-directed association studies.
Although the relatively small sample size in the association studies
produce results that require confirmation, the findings obtained
may be important in relation to the ongoing search for genes
responsible for the mechanism of daunorubicin-associated toxicity.

Furthermore, this model can be applied to any phenotype that can
be evaluated in LCLs.
