Abstract
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer. Improvement in the clinical outcome
of patients is likely to be achieved by the identiﬁcation of molecular events that underlie the oncogenesis of
ovarian cancer. Here we show that the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is aberrantly activated in ovarian
cancer. Using an unbiased and global phosphoproteomic approach, we proﬁled 69 Chinese primary ovarian
tumor tissues and found ALK to be aberrantly expressed and phosphorylated in 4 tumors. Genetic
characterization of these ALK-positive tumors indicated that full-length ALK expression in two serous
carcinoma patients is consistent with ALK gene copy number gain, whereas a stromal sarcoma patient carries
a novel transmembrane ALK fusion gene: FN1-ALK. Biochemical and functional analysis showed that both
full-length ALK and FN1-ALK are oncogenic, and tumors expressing ALK or FN1-ALK are sensitive to ALK
kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of ovarian tumor tissue microarray detected
aberrant ALK expression in 2% to 4% serous carcinoma patients. Our ﬁndings provide new insights into the
pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and identify ALK as a potential therapeutic target in a subset of serous
ovarian carcinoma and stromal sarcoma patients. Cancer Res; 72(13); 3312–23. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the ﬁfth leading cause of death from
cancer in women, following lung, breast, colon, and pancreatic cancers. In 2011, a total of 21,990 new cases and 15,460
deaths of ovarian cancer were projected in the United States
(The SEER Program of NCI). More than 90% ovarian cancer
cases are epithelial cancer, which represents a series of
molecularly and etiologically distinct diseases (1). Epithelial
ovarian cancer can be grouped into 2 types. Type I tumors
are genetically stable and conﬁned to the ovary at presentation. It includes low-grade serous, low-grade endomeAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts; 2Clinical Center for Gene Diagnosis and Therapy of the State Key

trioid, clear cell, mucinous, and Brenner carcinomas, 90%
of which are curable. In contrast, type II tumors, including
high-grade serous carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma,
and malignant mixed mesodermal tumors are highly aggressive and usually present in advanced stages (2). Most type II
tumors bear TP53 mutations and share no genetic alterations found in type I tumors (2, 3). High-grade serous
carcinoma stands out from other subtypes because it
accounts for 60% to 80% of ovarian cancer cases and most
deaths from ovarian cancer. Recent studies have shown that
high-grade serous carcinoma may arise from fallopian tube
epithelium other than ovary itself (1, 4, 5). Because of the
subtle nature of symptoms and inadequate screening tools,
most serous ovarian carcinoma patients present at advanced
stages with poor prognosis (2, 6). Although initial response
rates to standard surgery and chemotherapy are high, the
disease recurs in the majority of patients and eventually
becomes chemoresistant (7). The fact that the overall survival rate for women with ovarian cancer has not changed
over the last 30 years demands new therapeutic approaches.
With advances in understanding the genetics and molecular
biology of ovarian cancer, targeted therapy will likely have a
signiﬁcant impact on overcoming chemoresistant disease
and improvement of patient outcome (1, 6, 8).
Oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) have been
implicated in many types of solid tumors, including ovarian
cancer. A recent report by Sheng and colleagues showed that
an NRG1-Her3 autocrine loop could promote ovarian cancer
cell proliferation (9). Overexpression of other RTKs, such as

ALK as a Therapeutic Target in Ovarian Cancer

EGF receptor (EGFR), Her2, Her3, platelet-derived growth
factor receptor, and EphA2, was reported in ovarian cancer
(10–13). However, it remains to be determined whether
these RTKs play any roles in tumor initiation and progression in ovarian cancer.
In this article, we used an immunoafﬁnity proﬁling approach
(14–16) to identify activated tyrosine kinases in 69 primary
ovarian tumors. Our results indicate that many RTKs are
aberrantly phosphorylated in tumors. Most interestingly,
phosphorylation of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is
identiﬁed in 3 high-grade serous carcinoma patients and
one stromal tumor patient. When activated by mutations or
translocations, ALK can drive oncogenesis in non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (17), neuroblastoma (18–21), non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) (15, 22), inﬂammatory myoﬁbroblastic tumor
(23), and renal cell carcinoma (24, 25). Our biochemical and
functional analysis suggests that, as it does in other malignancies, ALK is likely driving a subset of ovarian cancers and could
be a new drug target in this devastating disease.

Materials and Methods
Patients, tissue specimens, and pathologic data
Ovarian tissues were collected randomly from 69 ovarian
tumor patients and 19 patients with benign gynecologic conditions who needed oophorectomy in the Xiangya Hospital
(Changsha, Hunan, China) from February 2009 to February
2010 with written consent from the patients (Institutional
Review Board approval). Tissue specimens were taken intraoperatively and were either formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁnembedded (FFPE) or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Histologic
typing and grading were carried out according to International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) guidelines.
General pathologic information of the 69 ovarian tumor
patients is listed in Supplementary Table S1. FFPE ovarian
tumor tissue microarray (TMA) slides were purchased from
Folio Biosciences and Biochain Institute, Inc.
Cell lines and antibodies
Ovarian cancer cell lines Ovsaho, Ovmana, and Ovmiu are
purchased from Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources/
Health Science Research Resources Bank. Antibodies against
ALK (D5F3 XP), phospho-ALK (Y1278/1282/1283), SHC,
phospho-SHC (Y234/240), Erk, phospho-Erk (T202/Y204),
Stat3, phospho-Stat3(Y705), phospho-AKT (S473), phospho-S6 (S235/236), CDC2 (CDK1), phospho-CDC2 (Y15), and
b-actin are from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.
Phosphotyrosine peptide proﬁling by PhosphoScan
An average of 15 milligrams of peptides were prepared
from 0.2 to 0.5 grams of resected frozen ovarian tissues
by homogenization, trypsin digestion, and Sep-pak C18
column puriﬁcation as described previously (14–16). Peptides containing phosphotyrosine were isolated by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against
phosphotyrosine (pY100), concentrated on reverse-phase
micro tips and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (LC/MS–MS). Brieﬂy, samples were col-

www.aacrjournals.org

lected with an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer, using a
top-ten method, a dynamic exclusion repeat count of 1, and
a repeat duration of 30 seconds. MS and MS/MS spectra
were collected in the Orbitrap and LTQ component of the
mass spectrometer, respectively. SORCERER-SEQUEST
(TM, v4.0.3 (c) 2008; Sage-N Research, Inc.) searches were
done against the NCBI human RefPept database downloaded
on January 6, 2009 (containing 37,742 proteins) or March 1,
2010 (containing 36,500 proteins), allowing for serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation (STYþ80) and methionine oxidation (Mþ16) as differential modiﬁcations. The
PeptideProphet probability threshold was chosen to give a
false positive rate of 5% for the peptide identiﬁcation (26).
Clustering and ranking analysis
To assess potentially aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation of
RTK in tumor tissues, spectral counts per RTK were summed
and normalized to the amount of peptide subjected to phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation (15 mg), elevated spectral
count in each tumor sample was calculated by subtracting
average spectral count in 19 normal ovarian tissues. Elevated
phosphotyrosine spectral counts of RTKs, representing elevated tyrosine phosphorylation, observed in 60 tumor samples
were used as basis for hierarchical Clustering using the Pearson
correlation distance metric and average linkage (MultiExperiment Viewer version 4.4). RTKs with elevated phosphorylation in tumors are ranked based on the average value of
elevated spectral count in corresponding tumors.
Western blot
Frozen ovarian tumor tissue were minced in liquid nitrogen
and resuspended in 1 cell lysis buffer. Tissue or cell suspension was then sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. Immunoblot analysis was carried out according to the manufacturer's standard protocol (www.cellsignal.com).
50 -Rapid ampliﬁcation of cDNA ends
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used to extract RNA from
human tumor samples. Rapid ampliﬁcation of cDNA ends
(RACE) was done with the use of 50 -RACE system (Invitrogen) with primer 50 -GCAGTAGTTGGGGTTGTAGTC for
cDNA synthesis and 50 -GCGGAGCTTGCTCAGCTTGT and
50 -TGCAGCTCCTGGTGCTTCC for a nested PCR reaction,
followed by cloning and sequencing the PCR products.
Reverse transcription PCR
RNA was extracted from ovarian tumor tissue or cell lines
using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR), ﬁrst-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 mg of
total RNA using SuperScript III ﬁrst-strand synthesis system
(Invitrogen) with oligo (dT)20. Primer pairs used to amplify
wild-type ALK and FN1-ALK transcripts were 50 -GAGGATATATAGGCGGCAAT, 50 -TGCAGCTCCTGGTGCTTCC, and 50 TAAGCTGGGTGTACGACCAA, 50 TGCAGCTCCTGGTGCTTCC, respectively. Transcripts from the control gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were ampliﬁed
using primer pairs 50 -GATTCCACCCATGGCAAATTCC and
50 -GATTCCACCCATGGCAAATTCC.

Quantitative PCR assay
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) was used to extract
genomic DNA from frozen ovarian tumor samples. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was done using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad). Each qPCR reaction contains 10 mL of SYBR Green Master
Mix, 1 mL of 10 nmol/L forward primer, 1 mL of 10 nmol/L
reverse primer, 6 mL of nuclease free water, and 2 mL of genomic
DNA at 10 ng/mL. qPCR reaction was carried out with the
following parameters: 95 C for 10 minutes followed by 40
cycles of 95 C for 15 seconds and 65 C for 15 seconds. A
dissociation run from 55 C to 95 C was added to the end of
qPCR reaction for melting curve analysis. Nonspeciﬁc ampliﬁcation was not detected with the primers used in the study.
PCR reactions were set up in duplicates for each sample tested.
Data were exported from CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection
System and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. We used an Ultra
Conservative Element (UCE) located on human Chromosome 7
(Chr7: 1,234,865–1,235,026) that has been identiﬁed to have a
copy number of 2 as reference DNA segment and calculated the
DCt by subtracting the Ct value of the UCE reactions from
that of the ALK reactions in each sample. This normalizes the
variation in the amount of templates between samples. We
then used DCt values from each individual to calculate relative
copy number against calibrator DNA isolated from NA10851
(Coriell Cell Repository). Calculations were carried out
to normalize a copy number of 2 to a value of 1 in the bar
graph. SDs were based on normalized Ct values of duplicates.
The sequences of the primers that are used to amplify ALK gene
are 50 -ACAAGGTCCACGGATCCAGAAACA and 50 -AGTCTCCCAGTTGCAACGTTAGGT.
Constructs and the establishment of 3T3 cell lines stably
expressing FN1-ALK and wild-type ALK
The coding sequences of wild-type ALK and FN1-ALK were
cloned from primary tumor samples OC26 and OC19, respectively, into retroviral vector MSCV-Neo. The expression plasmids were transfected into 293T cells by FuGene 6 (Roche
Diagnositcs), and retrovirus was harvested 48 hours later.
NIH3T3 cells were infected with MSCV-neo/ALK or MSCVneo/FN1ALK and selected in G418-containing media for 7
days. The cells were then cultured in soft agar or injected
subcutaneously into nude mice.
Tumor grafts and in vivo drug sensitivity studies
A total of 1.5  106 to 2  106 transduced 3T3 cells expressing
Src, FN1-ALK, or ALK were resuspended in Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously into the upper or
lower right ﬂank of 6 to 8 weeks old female NCR NU-F mice
purchased from Taconic. Mice were randomized to 3 treatment groups (n ¼ 6 per group) once the tumors became
palpable (50 mm3) and gavaged orally with vehicle (10% 1methy-2-pyrrolidinone/90% PEG-300) alone, 100 mg/kg/d crizotinib or 10 mg/kg/d TAE684 (NVP-TAE684) for 7 to 11 days.
Crizotinib and TAE684 were purchased from ChemieTek.
Tumors were measured every other day using calipers, and
tumor volume was calculated as 0.52  width2  length. Mice
were monitored daily for general conditions. The experiment
was terminated when the mean size of the treated or control

Results
Identiﬁcation of ALK phosphorylation in ovarian tumor
tissues by LC/MS–MS mass spectrometry
To identify oncogenic kinases in ovarian tumors, we carried
out immunoafﬁnity proﬁling of tyrosine phosphorylation in 69
tumor and 19 normal tissues with PhosphoScan (14). The
characteristics of the 69 ovarian cancer patients are summarized in Table 1. Most of the 43 serous type tissues were highgrade serous carcinoma characterized by cancerous spreading
in the pelvic area. LC/MS–MS identiﬁed 2,484 tyrosine phosphorylation sites in 1,349 proteins, with global false discovery
rate to be less than 5% using peptide prophet (26). These data
are available at PhosphoSitePlus (www.phosphosite.org). Spectral counts for all phosphotyrosine sites identiﬁed in tyrosine
kinases across the 88 ovarian tissues are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
Previous studies have shown that elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of RTKs may represent aberrant kinase activity
in tumor tissues, which could drive oncogenesis (15). Using
RTK tyrosine phosphorylation in 19 normal ovarian tissues
as basal phosphorylation level, we assessed potentially aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation of RTKs in tumor tissues. As
shown in Fig. 1A, we observed elevated tyrosine phosphorylation in many RTKs across the 60 tumor tissues, including

(Y1507, 1586) are shown.

discoidin domain receptors (DDR), ephrin receptor kinases
(EphA, EphB), as well as EGFR and FGFR family kinases.
Interestingly, ALK was ranked as the top kinase with the
highest elevated tyrosine phosphorylation among other
RTKs (Fig. 1B).
ALK phosphorylation was found in 4 patients, including
3 serous carcinoma patients OC07, OC16, and OC26 and a
stromal sarcoma patient OC19 (Fig. 1C). Hyperphosphorylation of ALK in OC19 is indicated by multiple phosphotyrosine sites in the juxtamembrane, kinase, and C-terminal
regulatory domains, many of which were seen previously
in other type of cancers (data not shown). Phosphorylation
of Y1507, which is equivalent to Y567 in NPM-ALK found
in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, was detected in all 4
patients (Fig. 1C). This phospho site was also observed in
primary tumor tissues and cell lines of NSCLC bearing
EML-ALK fusions, as well as neuroblastoma cell lines bearing ALK-activating mutations (data not shown). Extracted
ion chromatograms, MS2 spectra of 2 tryptic peptides con-

taining phosho-Y1507 indicated the detection of ALK peptides in these patients (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B).
Previous studies have shown that Y1507 (Y527 in NPMALK) located at the carboxyl terminal region of ALK is a
direct docking site for SH2 domain-containing transforming
protein (SHC1). Recruitment and phosphorylation of
SHC1 activate Ras/extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK) pathway and promotes tumorigenesis (27, 28). Consistent with these observations, using label-free quantiﬁcation analysis, we found hyperphosphorylation of SHC1,
mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), and CDK1
at speciﬁc sites (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S3) in the
3 serous carcinoma patients bearing ALK phosphorylation.
In addition, phosphorylation of other ALK downstream
signaling molecules, including those that are involved in
Jak/Stat3, PI3K/AKT pathways, are upregulated in these
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S3). These results
suggested that in serous carcinoma patients OC07, OC16,
and OC26, ALK might contribute to activation of multiple

signaling pathways that promote tumor cell survival, growth,
and proliferation.
Taken together, we found 4 of 69 (5.8%) ovarian cancer
patients carrying phosphorylated ALK at sites that correlate
with ALK oncogenesis, including 3 of 43 (7.0%) serous carcinoma and one stromal sarcoma patients. To our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst time that ALK tyrosine phosphorylation is
described in ovarian cancer.
Using an antibody directed against the ALK intracellular
domain, we examined ALK protein localization and expression
by immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis with
patient tissue (Fig. 2). Similar to neuroblastoma cells and
tumor tissues that overexpress ALK (21), we observed a
diffused ALK staining at the cytoplasm of serous carcinoma
OC26, but not in other serous carcinoma tissues such as OC29a
(Fig. 2A). In the stromal tumor OC19, strong ALK signal is
present at both the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm,
with membrane accentuation in some cells (Fig. 2A). Western
blot analysis detected mature full-length ALK at 220 kDa in
OC16 and OC26, and the potential proteolytically cleaved
140 kDa form (29) in OC26, which might be too weak to be
detected in OC16. We identiﬁed multiple ALK signals of
variable sizes in OC19, with the most prominent signal at
approximately 78 kDa, suggesting the presence of a novel form
of ALK different from the EML4-ALK Variant 3 fusion protein
in the lung cancer cell line H2228 (Fig. 2B). These results
suggested that OC19 might carry a different gene translocation involving ALK.
As a neuronal receptor kinase, ALK is not normally
expressed in the ovary. Expression and phosphorylation of
ALK in 4 ovarian cancer patients prompted us to test whether

the ALK gene in these patients may have undergone genetic
alterations. As the activating mutations previously reported
in neuroblastoma (18–20) were not detected in the cytoplasmic region of ALK in OC07, OC16, OC26, and OC19 (data
not shown), we set out to examine other possible genetic
alterations of ALK.
ALK gene copy number gain in serous carcinoma tissues
In neuroblastoma, ALK was identiﬁed as a recurrent target
of copy number gain and gene ampliﬁcation (18, 19, 21).
Recent study conducted by The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) research network indicated a remarkable degree of
genomic disarray in serous carcinoma (30). To examine
whether there is copy number variation (CNV) of ALK in
ovarian tumors in which ALK phosphorylation was detected,
we used real-time quantitative PCR with genomic DNA
isolated from serous carcinoma OC07, OC16, OC26, and
stromal sarcoma OC19, as well as serous carcinoma OC08,
in which ALK phosphorylation is not detected. Although
no obvious CNV of ALK was detected in OC08 and OC19,
ALK copy number gains of 1.5- and 1.7-fold were detected
in OC16 and OC26, respectively (Fig. 3A). The result is
consistent with our high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis, which indicated a copy number of
3 in the ALK region in patient OC26 (data not shown). The
ALK copy number gain in OC16 and OC26 may account for
the aberrant expression of ALK in these serous carcinoma
patients. Surprisingly, we observed a loss of ALK gene copies
in serous carcinoma OC07 (Fig. 3A), in which ALK phosphorylation (Fig. 1A and C, Supplementary Fig. S1) and
mRNA expression (see below) were detected, suggesting

that aberrant ALK expression and phosphorylation is independent of ALK copy number in this patient.
Identiﬁcation of a novel fusion protein FN1-ALK in a
malignant stromal sarcoma patient
Fusion of ALK kinase domain to a partner protein, resulting
in constitutive activation of ALK and oncogenesis in nonHodgkin lymphoma (17), NSCLC (15, 22, 31), inﬂammatory
myoﬁbroblastic tumor (23), and renal cell carcinoma (24, 25)
has been reported previously. Given the presence of highly
phosphorylated ALK with differing sizes in patient OC19 and
the fact that no ALK mutation or copy number gain was
detected in this patient, we suspected the presence of an ALK
gene translocation. To test this possibility, we carried out 50 RACE with RNA isolated from OC19 tumor. Because the

majority of previously reported ALK fusions have a common
breakpoint between exons 19 and 20 (15, 17, 22–25, 31),
we searched the sequences upstream of this common breakpoint using a primer annealing to the 50 end of exon 20.
Cloning and sequence determination of the RACE product
revealed that ALK is fused in frame to ﬁbronectin 1 (FN1),
encoding a ubiquitous component of extracellular matrix
(ECM) and plasma (32), at a novel breakpoint between ALK
exons 18 and 19. The resultant fusion protein FN1-ALK contains the amino-terminal 1,201 amino acids of FN1 and the
carboxyl-terminal 598 amino acids of ALK, which include the
transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions (Fig. 3B). Encoded by
the ﬁrst 23 exons, the FN1 portion of FN1-ALK retains a
diverse set of binding domains involved in ﬁbronectin selfassociation and interaction with other ECM components,

To examine the FN1-ALK gene fusion at genomic level, we
used PCR primers annealing to the 30 end of FN1 exon 23 and
the 50 end of ALK exon 19 to amplify DNA sequence spanning
the joint of these 2 genes. Sequences of the PCR product
revealed that the ﬁrst 946 base pairs of FN1 intron 23 were
fused to the last 14 base pairs of ALK intron 18 (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Given that ALK and FN1 map to the short and long
arm of chromosome 2 (2p23 and 2q34), respectively, in the
same orientation, it remains to be determined whether the
formation of the FN1-ALK fusion was caused by a large
interstitial deletion spanning the centromere or other chromosomal changes.

which could potentially provide strong activating signal to
ALK (Fig. 3B). Unlike previous ALK fusions, the novel breakpoint in FN1-ALK allows the ALK transmembrane region to
be retained in the fusion protein (Fig. 3B). The predicted
protein sequence of full-length FN1-ALK is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3B.
To test mRNA expression of FN1-ALK or full-length ALK in
tumors with ALK phosphorylation, we carried out RT-PCR
analysis with primers that speciﬁcally amplify fragments from
FN1-ALK or full-length ALK cDNA (Fig. 3C). ALK mRNA
expression was observed in the 3 serous carcinoma patients,
OC07, OC16, and OC26, as well as in 2 ovarian cell lines,
OVMANA and OVSAHO (Fig. 3C). In contrast, only FN1-ALK
mRNA, but not full-length ALK mRNA, was detected in OC19
(Fig. 3C). As expected, neither full-length ALK nor FN1-ALK
mRNA was detected in OC08 and the ovarian cancer cell line
Ovmiu. These results indicated that FN1-ALK fusion is present
in the stromal sarcoma patient OC19, whereas full-length ALK
expression resides in serous carcinoma patients OC07, OC16,
and OC26.

ALK as a Therapeutic Target in Ovarian Cancer

molecular weight: 198.82 kDa), which migrates at approximately 225 kDa, we observed a prominent ALK signal of
approximately 78 kDa in 3T3/FN1-ALK cells, which is a reminiscence of the strong ALK signal in patient OC19 tumor (Fig.
4B, Fig. 2B). We suspected that this approximately 78 kDa
protein is a fragment derived from full-length FN1-ALK. Both
ALK and FN1-ALK showed intracellular reticulum/Golgi
localization (Fig. 4C), as indicated by immunoﬂuorescence
analysis, probably due to a defect of glycosylation of
these overexpressed proteins in 3T3 cells (33). When 3T3/Neo,
3T3/ALK, or 3T3/FN1-ALK cells were injected subcutaneously
into nude mice, we observed tumor growth induced by both
3T3/ALK and 3T3/FN1-ALK cells, with the FN1-ALK tumors
growing more aggressively than the ALK tumors (Fig. 4C).
The average tumor sizes 12 days after injection were around
2,000 mm3 and 100 mm3 for FN1-ALK and ALK tumors,
respectively. If allowed to grow, ALK tumors could reach
approximately 2,000 mm3 20 days after injection (data not
shown). These results indicated that both the full-length ALK
and the FN1-ALK fusion isolated from the ovarian cancer
patients have transforming potential and that FN1-ALK is
more oncogenic than the full-length ALK.
To investigate downstream signaling pathways activated
by full-length ALK and FN1-ALK, we analyzed endogenous
signaling molecules of 293T cells when they overexpress
full-length ALK and FN1-ALK. Both full-length ALK and
FN1-ALK showed constitutive activation as indicated by
the phosphorylation of tyrosine sites in their kinase domain
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly, the 140 kDa cleaved
ALK and the approximately 78 kDa FN1-ALK fragment had
stronger phosphorylation than their full-length forms.
Consistent with ALK activation, phosphorylation of Stat3,
SHC, and Erk was upregulated, with FN1-ALK cells showing
stronger upregulation of these molecules than ALK cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4). ALK inhibitor crizotinib abolished
phosphorylation of both ALK and FN1-ALK. As expected,
phosphorylation of Stat3, SHC, and Erk was also diminished upon crizotinib treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Another ALK inhibitor TAE684 showed similar results (data
not shown). These results indicated that, similar to what we
observed in patient tumors using phosphoproteomic
approach, expression of both ALK and FN1-ALK in 293T
cells leads to activation of multiple downstream signaling
molecules, which can be inhibited by ALK inhibitors. In
addition, the stronger oncogenic activity of FN1-ALK than
full-length ALK might be attributed to its stronger potential
in activating downstream molecules, such as Stat3, SHC,
and Erk, whose activation contributes to cell growth and
proliferation.
ALK and FN1-ALK as potential therapeutic target
Both PF-02341066 (crizotinib) and TAE684 are potent and
selective ALK inhibitors that have been shown to suppress
tumor cell growth in several types of cancers expressing
different ALK fusion proteins (34–38). We tested the effects
of these inhibitors on the growth of ALK and FN1-ALK
tumors in nude mice. As shown in Fig. 5A, administration
of crizotinib (100 mg/kg/d) drastically inhibited the growth

www.aacrjournals.org

of both ALK and FN1-ALK tumors, but not the 3T3/SRC
tumors. Consistent with these observations, Western blot
analysis using antibodies speciﬁc for ALK and phospho-ALK
revealed that crizotinib abolished phosphorylation of both
full-length FN1-ALK and the approximately 78 kDa ALK
variant 24 hours after treatment (Fig. 5B). We also observed
an ALK signal with lower molecular weight next to the fulllength FN1-ALK in crizotinib-treated tumor, which is likely
to be a signal of nonphophorylated FN1-ALK (Fig. 5B).
Similar tumor growth-inhibiting effects were observed with
TAE684 (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results suggested
that ALK and FN1-ALK tumors are highly sensitive to ALK
inhibitors.
Detection of ALK expression in a larger patient cohort
To test possible aberrant ALK expression in a larger patient
cohort, we carried out immunohistochemical analysis on
ovarian TMAs. Similar to what we observed in the Chinese
cohort (69 tumors) using PhosphoScan, although no ALK
staining was detected in normal tissues, granulosa-theca cell
tumors, or clear cell carcinomas, ALK staining was detected in
14 of 353 (4%) serous carcinoma and 3 of 37 endometrioid
carcinoma specimens, with half of the specimens having strong
ALK signal (Fig. 6A and B). We observed mostly weak ALK
staining in some mucinous carcinoma specimens (Fig. 6A,
images not shown). Consistent with what we found in patient
OC26, most of the ALK staining observed in serous carcinomas
in TMA was diffusedly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6B). This
result suggested that ALK might be activated and signaling
in these tumors, similar to what has been observed in neuroblastomas, in which full-length ALK is overexpressed (21).
Considering that a signiﬁcant number of high-grade serous
carcinoma has been misclassiﬁed as endometrioid carcinoma
(1, 39), our data suggested that strong ALK expression resides
mainly in a portion (2%) of serous carcinoma.

Discussion
Oncogenic role of ALK has been well characterized in
many types of hematopoietic and solid tumors, in which
ALK is deregulated by gene translocations, activating mutations, and ampliﬁcation (15, 17–25, 31, 40, 41). Although ALK
transcript was reported to be present in epithelial ovarian
cancer (42), ALK protein expression and phosphorylation
in ovarian cancer has not been reported. Using a phosphoproteomic approach, we identiﬁed ALK tyrosine phosphorylation in 4 of 69 primary ovarian tumor tissues. Further
investigation revealed ALK gene copy number gain in 2
serous carcinoma patients and a novel ALK gene translocation (FN1-ALK) in a stromal sarcoma patient. Mouse 3T3
ﬁbroblasts overexpressing full-length ALK or FN1-ALK generated subcutaneous tumor in nude mice. In addition, we
showed that ALK inhibitors dramatically suppressed the
growth of both 3T3 ALK and 3T3 FN1-ALK tumors. This
study provides new insight into the molecular pathogenesis
of ovarian cancer and compelling rationale for extending
targeted therapy against ALK to this new type of solid tumor.
Oncogenic role of full-length ALK has been implicated in
neuroblastoma (21), glioblastoma (43), and breast cancer (44).

treated with vehicle or 100 mg/kg/d crizotinib by oral gavage when tumors are palpable (50 mm ). The tumors are measured every other day until the mean
tumor size of the vehicle treated mice reaches 1,500 mm3. B, mice carrying FN1-ALK tumors were treated with vehicle or crizotinib for 24 hours before the
tumors were harvested and analyzed by Western blot assay using antibodies against ALK, phospho-ALK (Y1278/1282/1283), and b-actin. Arrows indicate
the positions of the full-length FN1-ALK and the approximately 78 kDa truncated ALK variant. Note an ALK signal with lower molecular weight ( ) next
to the FN1-ALK, which is likely nonphosphorylated FN1-ALK.

Consistent with a recent report from TCGA Research Network,
in which 489 high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas were
analyzed (30), we did not ﬁnd any activating mutation or
signiﬁcant gene ampliﬁcation of ALK in 41 serous carcinoma
patients. However, our data showed phosphorylation of fulllength ALK at Y1507 in 3 serous carcinoma patients, 2 of which
have ALK gene copy number gain. The phosphorylation of
multiple downstream signaling molecules such as SHC1,
STAT3, tyrosine kinases (SYK, FRK, and FYN), SHIP 2 (INPPL1),
MAPK14, CDK1, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), are
upregulated compared with other serous carcinoma patients.
These results indicate that previously reported Ras/ERK, Jak3/
Stat3, and PI3K/Akt pathways, which mediate the effect of ALK
activity and promote tumor cell proliferation and survival (27,
28), are activated in ALK-bearing serous carcinoma patients.
Our proteomic approach also identiﬁed many other molecules
such as NEDD9 and PKCd (PRKCD) that are involved in
transformation (45, 46) in these patients, although their relevance to ALK activity has yet to be determined. Aberrant
expression, phosphorylation, cytoplasmic localization, as well
as activation of ALK downstream signaling pathways suggest
an oncogenic role of full-length ALK in serous ovarian carcinoma. Interestingly, unlike 3T3/FN1-ALK cells, 3T3/ALK cells
did not generate transformed colonies in soft agar assay (data

3320

Cancer Res; 72(13) July 1, 2012

not shown). However, they generated tumors in nude mice. We
suspect that full-length ALK could be activated through paracrine signaling under in vivo conditions. Functional validation
using more pathologically relevant models such as primary
tumor xenografts or fallopian tube secretory epithelial cell (4)
models will be helpful in assessing the transforming effects of
ALK and determine how full-length ALK is activated in serous
carcinomas.
The novel fusion protein FN1-ALK identiﬁed in a stromal
sarcoma patient represents the ﬁrst ALK fusion protein bearing the transmembrane domain of ALK itself. Fusion to the
FN1 gene that encodes a ubiquitously expressed ECM protein
likely causes high-level expression of the ALK kinase. Unlike
most ALK fusion partner proteins that render ALK constitutive activity through homodimerization, FN1 may do so
through its strong interactions with ECM structures and
components such as ﬁbrin, heparin, collagen, and gelatin.
Because ﬁbronectin is subjected to proteolytic breakdown
by a number of neutral proteases (47), the approximately
78 kDa fragment of FN1-ALK that we observed in both the
patient tumor and transfected 3T3 or 293T cells is likely a
proteolytically cleaved product of full-length FN1-ALK
(220 kDa). Strong expression, hyperphosphorylation, and
membrane/cytoplasmic localizations of ALK suggest

constitutive internalization and activation of FN1-ALK, which
may lead to its strong oncogenic potential, as evidenced by the
strong activation of downstream molecules in 293T cells and
the in vivo tumorigenecity assay. Considering the sensitivity of
3T3/FN1-ALK tumors to ALK inhibitors and the recent promising results of treating inﬂammatory myoﬁbroblastic tumor
(IMT) with ALK inhibitor crizotinib (38), we expect optimistic
response of stromal sarcoma patients carrying FN1-ALK to
targeted therapy against ALK. Our discovery broadens the
scope of ALK fusion oncoproteins in human cancer and
identiﬁes a compelling therapeutic target in a new type of
mesenchymal neoplasm.
To overcome chemoresistance and to improve the overall
survival of ovarian cancer patients, targeted therapy has come
to the forefront of investigation. Among reported oncogenes
(8) associated with ovarian cancer identiﬁed to date, EGFR
received substantial attention as a therapeutic target because
of its overexpression in 70% ovarian cancer patients (48).
However, inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies against EGFR
only resulted in marginal efﬁcacy due to toxic side effects and
lack of inhibitor-sensitizing EGFR mutations in ovarian cancer

patients (49). Unlike EGFR, which is ubiquitously expressed in
normal tissue, ALK expression is restricted to certain parts of
the brain (50). This might explain why inhibition of ALK has
little toxic effects in patients (28). As shown recently in NSCLC
and IMT patients, ALK inhibitor crizotinib only showed grade 2
side effects at a dose of 250 mg twice daily (37, 38). Compared
with 10% response rate to second-line chemotherapy, the
response rate of NSCLC patients carrying the EML4-ALK
fusion to crizotinib is 57% (37). Given the presence of an
ALK-driven subgroup of ovarian cancer, especially serous
carcinoma patients, and the fact that crizotinib inhibited ALK
or FN1-ALK tumor growth and activation of downstream
signaling molecules, we speculate that crizotinib or other
ALK-targeting agent may become effective treatment in these
patients.
Besides ALK inhibitors, other therapeutic options for ALK
bearing ovarian cancer patients might also be considered.
First, coexpression/activation of other RTKs in ALK-bearing
serous carcinoma patients, such as Ret (in OC26) (21), suggests
that combinational therapy against multiple RTK could provide better outcome. Second, as ALK expression is tumor
speciﬁc in ovarian cancer, antibody-mediated immunotherapy
against ALK could be highly efﬁcient with little damage to
normal tissue. Third, as previously shown in anaplastic large
cell lymphoma (28), ALK is likely to be highly immunogenic in
ovarian cancer patients and thus could be an ideal target for
antitumor vaccination in these patients.
Combining our results from the Chinese patient cohort and
the immunohistochemical analysis of TMA containing more
than 400 ovarian tumors of a distinct patient cohort, we
estimate that 2% to 4% high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma
patients have aberrant ALK expression. Given the annual
approximately 140,000 worldwide new cases and approximately 7,000 deaths from high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, the
number of patients who might beneﬁt from targeted therapy
against ALK could be substantial.
