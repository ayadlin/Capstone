Abstract:

	
Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has been discussed as a potential anticancer
agent for many years, however initial enthusiasm about its clinical use as a systemic
agent was curbed due to significant toxicities and lack of efficacy. Combination of TNF-α
with chemotherapy in the setting of hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (ILP) has
provided new insights into a potential therapeutic role of this agent. The therapeutic
benefit from TNF-α in ILP is thought to be not only due to its direct anti-proliferative
effect, but also due to its ability to increase penetration of the chemotherapeutic
agents into the tumor tissue. New concepts for the use of TNF-α as a facilitator rather
than as a direct actor are currently being explored with the goal to exploit the ability
of this agent to increase drug delivery and to simultaneously reduce systemic toxicity.
	
This review article provides a comprehensive overview on the published
previous experience with systemic TNF-α. Data from 18 phase I and 10
phase II single agent as well as 18 combination therapy studies illustrate
previously used treatment and dose schedules, response data as well as the
most prominently observed adverse effects. Also discussed, based on recent
preclinical data, is a potential future role of systemic TNF-α in combination
with liposomal chemotherapy to facilitate increased drug uptake into tumors.

Introduction

delivered TNF-α. More encouraging is the current clinical
use of combination TNF-α with chemotherapeutic agents
in the setting of hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion
in limb-threatening soft tissue sarcomas and in-transit
melanoma [3]. Here we review the phase I and phase II
clinical trials of systemic use of TNF-α, the toxicities
and responses observed, and highlight recent scientific
advances that hint at reduced systemic toxicities and
augmentation of the antitumor responses seen with this
agent. Specifically, the recently identified vascular effects
of TNF-α that lead to a targeted intra-tumoral enrichment
of liposomes and macromolecules through an enhancedenhanced permeability and retention effect (E2PR) [4-6].

TNF-α was discovered in 1975 and subsequently
cloned in 1984 [1, 2] and has been the focus of considerable
interest as an anticancer agent. Initial enthusiasm for
TNF-α as a systemic therapeutic agent stemmed from the
observation that it could induce hemorrhagic necrosis in
the tumors of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-primed
and endotoxin treated mice [1]. Recombinant human
TNF-α (rhTNF-α) has been tested as a systemic treatment
in several phase I and phase II clinical trials. These trials,
conducted in the 1980s and 1990s, used TNF-α as both
a single agent and in combination with other cytokines
or chemotherapeutics. However, the initial enthusiasm
for the development of TNF-α as a systemic treatment
has waned in the face of significant toxicities and a lack
of evidence for therapeutic benefit. Nevertheless, these
studies have provided valuable data regarding the toxicity
profile and pharmacological properties of systemically

Biology of TNF-α
TNF-α is a 23 kilodalton (kDa) type II
transmembrane protein arranged in stable homotrimers.
A 51 kDa soluble homotrimeric cytokine is derived from
739

that this sensitivity was greater in colorectal and lung
cancers [18]. In vivo, TNF-α has shown activity against
a wide variety of murine tumor types and human tumor
xenografts [19-21]. Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo
data were suggestive that TNF-α had the potential to be
highly specific anti-cancer therapy, with activity against a
number of tumor types.
Preclinical evidence also suggested a synergistic
effect of TNF-α with a variety of chemotherapeutics
in vitro and in vivo. TNF-α has been shown to enhance
the cytotoxicity of DNA topoisomerase inhibitors
actinomycin D, adriamycin, and etoposide against murine
bladder tumor cell line (MBT-2) in in vitro and in vivo
models [22]. The enhancing effect of TNF-α was not
observed with other cytotoxic agents, such as: bleomycin,
hydroxyurea, cisplatin, mitomycin C, vincristine and
vinblastine. The timing of TNF-α treatment in relation to
chemotherapy seems important with studies suggesting
that the optimal time for TNF-α therapy is 48 hours prior
to initiation of chemotherapy [23]. Interestingly, there are
likely two mechanisms that underlie the importance of
timing in regards to TNF-α treatment. Firstly, inhibitors of
transcription, such as actinomycin D and flavopiridol, are
used before or at the time of TNF-α treatment and block
NF-kB pathway activation, sensitizing cells to the effects
of TNF-α [24]. Secondly, inhibitors of topoisomerase II
can be given at the time of, or after TNF-α and increase
the sensitivity of TNF-α resistant cancer cell lines to
TNF-α [25].
TNF-α also demonstrated enhanced antitumor effects
in vitro when used in combination with other cytokines
[26]. Induction of TNF-α receptors rather than an increased
affinity of already present receptors explained the effect
of IFN-γ on TNF-α binding [26, 27]. Similarly, in vitro
and in vivo studies using the TNF-α resistant melanoma
cell line B16BL6 demonstrated that IFN-γ sensitizes
cancer cells to the effects of TNF-α, inducing necrosis
and tumor response, which were previously absent
[28]. Later, investigators showed that TNF-α induced
synergistic growth inhibition against pancreatic cancer
cell lines when combined with interferon alpha (IFN-α)
and IFN-γ [29]. TNF-α and IFN-γ act against many other
cancer cell lines as well. Orita et al. [30] tested TNF-α
and IFN-γ on 23 cell lines in vitro and demonstrated that
the combination acts synergistically, showing cytostatic
and cytotoxic effects on cell lines previously resistant to
TNF-α and IFN-γ individually.
Combinations of TNF-α with IFN-α and IL-2 also
showed synergistic cytotoxic and cytostatic effects in vitro
and in vivo. Concomitant TNF-α and IFN-α in a murine
lung metastasis model significantly increased survival
[31]. TNF-α and IL-2 in murine models with leukemia,
mastocytoma, melanoma, lymphoma and sarcoma cell
lines also demonstrate combinatorial effects and systemic
immunological memory [32, 33].
The combination of TNF-α and radiotherapy has been

the transmembrane form via proteolytic cleavage by the
metalloprotease TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) [7].
TNF-α is primarily produced by macrophages, but also by
a variety of other cells, including NK cells, T lymphocytes,
smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and others [8]. Release
of TNF-α occurs in response to inflammatory stimuli and
cytokines including peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide
and other bacterial components [9]. Two receptors
exist for TNF-α: 1). Tumor necrosis factor receptor 1
(TNFR1), which preferentially binds soluble TNF-α and
is found almost ubiquitously on the surface of cells, and
2). Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2), which is
found on cells of the hematopoietic lineage and which has
specificity for the transmembrane form of TNF-α [10].
The resulting biological effect of TNF-α binding to its
receptor is depending on the type of receptor activated and
the cellular state during activation. Stimulation of TNFR1
activates downstream inflammatory mediators through
AP1, MAPK and NF-kB pathways [11]. The balance
of activation of these pathways by TNF-α is critical in
determining whether a cell undergoes apoptosis as a late
stage event in TNF-α stimulation. For instance, in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), NF-kB dependent induction
of HO-1 underlies resistance to TNF-α induced apoptosis
[12]. Similarly, inhibition of NF-kB with concurrent TNF-α
stimulation results in caspase activation and apoptosis
[13]. Conversely, the biological role and downstream
effects of TNFR2 stimulation are more poorly understood.
TNFR2 can be up-regulated by cytokine stimulation
and also mediate a variety of downstream inflammatory
mediators [14].

Preclinical evidence for TNF-α
as an anticancer agent
After the initial observation that TNF-α induced
hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors in mice treated with BCG
and endotoxin [1], the potential of TNF-α as a therapeutic
agent was intensely studied in in vitro and in vivo studies.
These studies highlighted the possible role of TNF-α as an
anticancer agent and galvanized support for the numerous
phase I and phase II studies that followed.
In vitro studies demonstrated that TNF-α had a
growth inhibitory effect on SV40-tranformed human
mammary epithelia cells and a cytotoxic effect on breast
cancer cell lines. Interestingly, there was no effect on
normal human mammary epithelial cells [15]. Similarly,
TNF-α showed a cytostatic effect on hepatoma cells
while having little effect on non-tumorigenic liver cells
[16]. Intriguingly, Sugarman and colleagues showed that
the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of TNF-α were cell
line specific, with only a proportion of tumor cell lines
responding to TNF-α [17]. Comparison of the cytostatic
and cytotoxic effect of TNF-α against a wide range of
tumor types demonstrated that approximately a quarter of
tumors (28%) are sensitive to the effects of TNF-α and

less extensively studied. Investigation of the interaction
of TNF-α and radiation in 14 human tumor cells lines
demonstrated synergistic or additive cytotoxicity with
the maximum effect when TNF-α was given 4-12 hours
before irradiation [34]. The mechanism of this synergism
is thought to be due to the induction of oxygen free radical
species and resulting DNA damage.

systemic TNF-α. Studies have encompassed a wide range
of tumor types in both adult and pediatric patients. In
the majority of phase I and phase II studies, TNF-α was
administered as an intravenous bolus injection or infusion.
However, a few phase I studies have evaluated TNF-α
with subcutaneous or intramuscular administration.
Phase I studies conducted with TNF-α are detailed
in Table 1 [35-52]. Eighteen phase I studies were
conducted and published with rhTNF-α as a single
agent systemic therapy, enrolling between 19 and 62
patients per study. Study design varied with single dose
of rhTNF-α, multiple dosing (daily to every three weeks)
and continuous infusion (one to five day duration) being
tested. Overall, it appears that a systemic TNF-α dose of
150-200 µg/m2, given as a 30 minute intravenous infusion
was identified as MTD in several studies. Dose-limiting
toxicities (DLT) as well as other side effects that were
observed seemed to have been universal and in most cases
reasonably well tolerated and reversible. Common DLTs
included: hypotension, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,
neurotoxicity, fever, nausea/vomiting, as well as general
symptoms of malaise and weakness (Table 2). Other
pathological sequelae of a transient hypovolemic episode,
including transient elevation of liver enzymes, were
reported. Tumor responses however, when used as a
single agent, even with more intense treatment schedules,
were rare.
Phase II studies using systemically administered
rhTNF-α are detailed in Table 3 [53-62]. Studies typically
investigated advanced/metastatic cases of: colorectal
cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, malignant
melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. The majority of
studies involved a small number of cases (16-26), an
exception being a phase II study of various malignancies
that enrolled 147 patients [59]. Study design varied, with
150-200 µg/m2 given as a 30 minute intravenous infusion
daily for 3-5 days and repeated every 1-4 weeks being
commonly employed. In all studies, tumor responses
were rare and when they did occur, only partial responses
were observed. In the largest study of 147 cancer patients
treated with 150μg/m2 for 5 days every other week, only
1 partial remission was noted while 13% of patients
experienced a grade 4 or greater toxicity. The most serious
toxicities included respiratory failure and coagulopathies.
Other, less serious and more common side effects
reported include: hypotension (31%), leukopenia (38%),
thrombocytopenia (13%), fever / chills (69%), headache
(25%), nausea / vomiting (69%) and hepatopathy (10%).
However, compared to other phase II studies this regimen
was fairly dose-dense which may have increased the
significant toxicity observed.

and efficacy of systemic rhTNF-α combined with
carmustine [3], actinomycin D [63, 64], carboplatin and
etoposide [65], dactinomycin [66] and doxorubicin [67]
have been reported and are detailed in Table 4. In all
trials, intravenous rhTNF-α was given concurrently or
sequentially to chemotherapeutics on multiple days and
treatments being repeated for a number of cycles. Dose
of intravenous rhTNF-α ranged from 88-200μg/m2 and
was similar to the dose used for rhTNF-α monotherapy.
In one study of rhTNF-α and BCNU in advanced
melanoma, a response rate of 20% was seen with BCNU
alone compared to 10.5% with BCNU and rhTNF-α
[3]. Additionally, treatment of recurrent or refractory
Wilms tumor with dactinomycin and rhTNF-α resulted
in a 15.8% response rate [66]. However, while patients
in this study were previously treated with dactinomycin,
response to therapy was not conclusively due to the action
of rhTNF-α. Together, trials of rhTNF-α combined with
chemotherapeutics have failed to prove that the addition
of rhTNF-α to the treatment regimen improved outcome.

in

combination

with

Three studies that combined rhTNF-α with external
beam radiation have also been reported [77-79] and they
are detailed in Table 6. The most recent studies combined
radiotherapy with both rhTNF-α and the chemotherapeutic
ranimustine for the treatment of malignant astrocytoma
[79]. In these studies DLTs were not observed and
consequently, the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen
was difficult to ascertain. In addition, no synergy in terms
of objective response was noted.

Future directions of systemic
TNF-α
Translation of systemic TNF-α from research to
clinic has been hampered by significant systemic toxicity
and a lack of efficacy at MTD [43, 46]. Future directions
for the development of TNF-α therapy rely on amelioration
of the toxicity seen with systemic therapy and thereby
increasing direct tumor response through higher TNF-α
doses. Alternatively, the exploitation of novel mechanisms
of action may increase efficacy and safety through indirect
tumor effects.
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated proteins have
shown increased retention and decreased immunogenicity
in vivo [80]. Attempts to conjugate rhTNF-α with PEG
has yielded a therapeutic with decreased toxicity and
increased efficacy in murine preclinical models [8184]. Thamm and colleagues conducted a phase I clinical
trial of PEG-rhTNF-α in dogs with spontaneously
occurring tumors [85]. Comparatively, Client-owned
dogs provide an excellent model in which to develop
novel anticancer agents. These dogs are genetically
diverse, immunocompetent, share our environment and
have similar types and size of tumors to people [86].
Interestingly, in this study the MTD of PEG-rhTNF-α

Systemic rhTNF-α in combination with cytokines
Many studies have combined systemic administration
of rhTNF-α with other cytokines such as: IFN-γ [68-72],
IL-2 [73-76] and IFN-α [76], and these are summarized
in Table 5. In general, phase I studies showed a reduction
in the MTD of rhTNF-α when used in combination with
other cytokines for patients with advanced solid tumors.
This was largely due to the overlap in toxicities of these
cytokines, that is: hypotension, fever, thrombocytopenia,
acute renal failure, anemia, cardiac arrhythmias and
pulmonary edema. Disappointingly, few objective
responses were reported and none of the combinations
were tested in larger randomized phase II studies; most
likely because of the toxicity associated with combined
therapy and a lack of efficacy seen in the initial studies.

studies are worthwhile considering the novel mechanism
of synergism between TNF-α and liposomal doxorubicin.

was found to be 26.7μg/kg (approximately 815μg/m2) and
4 of 15 dogs treated had a partial tumor response. DLT
was similar to that observed with unconjugated TNF-α,
with hypotension and coagulopathy being observed. This
study suggests that PEG-rhTNF-α may limit some of the
undesirable toxicity seen with unconjugated TNF-α and
allow for greater antitumor responses.
Asparagine-glycine-arginine conjugated to the
N-terminus of TNF-α (NGR-TNF-α) specifically binds
the aminopeptidase N (CD13) of tumor vasculature [87].
CD13 is required for the pathological development of
vasculature in the disease and presents an ideal target
to modulate the effect of chemotherapeutics [88, 89].
Preclinical studies of NGR-TNF-α showed synergism
with doxorubicin, cisplatin, placitaxel and gemcitabine,
increasing tumor penetration of cytotoxic compounds,
anticancer efficacy and decreasing treatment associated
toxicity [90]. Interestingly, increase in efficacy was seen
in vivo but not in vitro with tumor cell lines, indicating
that this synergism is due to an indirect effect of NGRTNF-α on host vasculature [90]. A recent Phase Ib study
of low-dose NGR-TNF-α with doxorubicin in advanced
solid tumors demonstrated that this combination is well
tolerated with no DLT observed [67]. A phase II dose of
0.8μg/m2 of NGR-TNF-α and 75mg/m2 of doxorubicin
was recommended. The study provided hope for future
development of TNF-α and doxorubicin combination
therapy with 1 of 15 patients achieving a partial response
and 10 of 15 patients with stable disease for a median
duration of nearly 6 months.
An alternative concept for the use of TNF-α in the
treatment of human cancers exists. Preclinical in vivo
studies demonstrated that the uptake of radiolabeled
liposomes in tumors was increased by approximately 6
fold in mice that were concomitantly treated with TNF-α
[4]. The mechanism behind this enrichment is thought to
be mediated through effects on the tumor vasculature and
an enhanced-enhanced permeability and retention (E2PR)
effect. In vivo experiments using the combination of
TNF-α and liposomal doxorubicin showed a significantly
increased survival benefit in tumor-bearing mice treated
with the combination in comparison to mice treated with
either TNF-α or liposomal doxorubicin alone. Although
single-agent liposomal doxorubicin alone delayed
tumor growth and led to improved survival, the tumors
eventually grew back, whereas the combination treatment
with TNF-α and liposomal doxorubicin led to a long-term
survival in 80% of the treated animals. These findings are
in accordance with previously published data showing
improved treatment outcomes in rat osteosarcoma and
murine melanoma tumor models that were treated with lowdose TNF-α plus liposomal doxorubicin in comparison to
TNF-α plus free doxorubicin [5, 91]. The development of
low-dose TNF-α and liposomal doxorubicin may provide
unique synergy to increase efficacy and decrease toxicity
of combination therapy. Clinical studies are necessary to

Conclusion
TNF-α has been proven an effective anticancer agent
in in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Sadly, the promise
of systemic TNF-α has, as of yet, not translated to a patient
therapy and enthusiasm has been curbed due to the toxicity
profile and lack of efficacy at MTD. Combination with
chemotherapy in the setting of hyperthermic isolated limb
perfusion has proven quite successful, based not only on a
direct anti-proliferative effect of TNF-α, but also due to its
ability to increase drug penetration into tumor tissue. The
future development of systemic TNF-α as an anticancer
treatment will rely on exploring ways to reduced systemic
toxicity and exploit novel mechanisms of action to deliver
greater efficacy simultaneously with decreased toxicity. A
number of avenues are currently being explored based on
promising preclinical and early clinical data. The novel
concept of using systemic TNF-α to facilitate increased
tumor penetration of liposomal chemotherapy seems
particularly promising and worth exploring clinically.
