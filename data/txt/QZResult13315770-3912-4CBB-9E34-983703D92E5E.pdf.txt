BACKGROUND: nab-Paclitaxel (ABI-007, Abraxane), a 130-nM, albumin-bound (nab) particle form of Cremophor-free
paclitaxel, is approved for metastatic breast cancer. In the current study, the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel
were evaluated in previously treated and chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). METHODS:
Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed, measurable MM were enrolled. nab-Paclitaxel was administered
intravenously weekly for 3 of 4 weeks at a dose of 100 mg/m2 (in previously treated patients) or 150 mg/m2 (in chemotherapy-naive patients). RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated in each cohort. The response rate was 2.7% in
the previously treated cohort and 21.6% in the chemotherapy-naive cohort; the response plus stable disease rate was
37.8% and 48.6% in the previously treated and chemotherapy-naive cohorts, respectively. The median progressionfree survival (PFS) was 3.5 months and 4.5 months, and the median survival was 12.1 months and 9.6 months, respectively. The probability of being alive and free of disease progression at 6 months was 27% for the previously treated
cohort and 34% for the chemotherapy-naive cohort; the probability of surviving 1 year was 49% and 41%, respectively,
for the previously treated and chemotherapy-naive cohorts. Approximately 78% of the previously treated patients
and 49% of the chemotherapy-naive patients were treated without dose reduction. Eight (22%) chemotherapy-naive
patients discontinued therapy because of toxicities. Drug-related toxicities included grade 3 to 4 (graded according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 3.0]) neuropathy, alopecia, neutropenia, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: nab-Paclitaxel was found to be well tolerated and demonstrated activity in both previously treated and chemotherapy-naive patients with MM. The response rate, PFS, and survival
compared favorably with current standard dacarbazine therapy and combination therapies for melanoma. nabC

KEYWORDS: ABI-007 (Abraxane), nab-paclitaxel, melanoma, overall survival.

There are approximately 8000 new patients diagnosed each year with stage IV metastatic melanoma (MM) in the
United States.1 The current treatment is unsatisfactory, and the long-term survival rate is approximately 10%.2 For
patients with solitary metastases in organs such as the lung and liver, metastasectomy alone is an option and, if complete,
yields a median survival of 20 months and a 5-year survival rate of approximately 15%.3 The accuracy of this conclusion
needs to be confirmed by a prospective study, because the majority of the studies of this type are retrospective.
Chemotherapy and biologic therapy have been explored extensively in melanoma.4 Dacarbazine is commonly used
as a treatment for MM and remains the standard of care for the disease. Although not approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for melanoma, temozolomide is also widely used. In 2 recently conducted, large-scale, front-line phase 3
trials, dacarbazine alone, in the control arm of the studies, was compared with dacarbazine plus oblimersen sodium5 and
with temozolomide,6 resulting in objective response rates of 6.8% and 12.1%, median progression-free survival (PFS)

durations of 1.6 months and 1.5 months, and median
overall survival (OS) durations of 7.8 months and 6.4
months, respectively.5,6 To the best of our knowledge
aldesleukin is the only other agent approved for the treatment of MM; it is not widely used because of toxicity and
difficulty of administration.7 Solvent-based taxanes have
been reported to have some limited activity in malignant
melanoma. Solvent-based paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers
Squibb, Princeton, NJ) was reported to cause objective
responses in 12% to 18% of patients in an initial study,
but some subsequent trials were not as positive.8-11 Solvent-based docetaxel (Taxotere; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) demonstrated low response rates and high
levels of toxicity, particularly grade 4 neutropenia, in
phase 2 studies.12,13
Although solvent-based taxanes are active, both their
high rate of toxicity and their limited efficacy can be
attributed to their water-insolubility, resulting in limited
uptake and adverse reactions to the solvents used in each
formulation. nab-Paclitaxel (ABI-007 [Abraxane],
Abraxis BioScience, LLC, Los Angeles, Calif) is a solventfree, 130-nM albumin-bound (nab) particle formulation
of paclitaxel, in which stable albumin particles complex
noncovalently with paclitaxel.14 nab-Paclitaxel is highly
and readily bioavailable in contrast to other water-insoluble chemotherapy drugs. In animal models, intratumoral
paclitaxel concentrations were 33% higher after the
administration of nab-paclitaxel compared with equal
doses of solvent-based paclitaxel l.15 In addition, compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel was
less toxic, allowing a 50% increase in the equitoxic dose in
animals.15 The maximum tolerated dose in humans
(300 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) was also higher than the maximum tolerated dose of solvent-based paclitaxel.16,17
These improvements in the delivery of nab-paclitaxel have been confirmed by the results of a randomized
phase 3 trial. When compared with solvent-based paclitaxel in women with metastatic breast cancer, nab-paclitaxel was associated with higher objective response rates
and longer PFS without increased toxicity.18 Similar
increased antitumor activity in metastatic breast cancer
has recently been demonstrated versus solvent-based docetaxel.19 These clinical data were predicted by preclinical
models in which nab-paclitaxel demonstrated consistently
better antitumor activity and was associated with a higher
intratumoral concentration of drug when compared with
solvent-based paclitaxel or docetaxel.15
In a phase 1 trial conducted in 39 patients with
advanced solid tumors who received weekly nab-paclitaxel

156

for 3 of 4 weeks, the maximum tolerated doses of nabpaclitaxel were 100 mg/m2 and 150 mg/m2, respectively,
in heavily pretreated and chemotherapy-naive patients.17
Prolonged disease stabilization was observed in 5 of the 14
patients with malignant melanoma, suggesting that nabpaclitaxel had antitumor activity in this disease. This, in
addition to the novel mechanism of action and the results
of the phase 3 trial mentioned earlier, was the basis for
conducting the study reported herein.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was conducted in compliance with the Good
Clinical Practice guidelines of the International
Conference on Harmonization and the Declaration of
Helsinki. The protocol and all related materials were
approved by the University of Arizona Human Subjects
Committee as well as those of each participating institution, and in accord with the assurance filed with
the US Department of Health and Human Services.
Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients before participation.
Patient Population
Eligible patients were men and nonpregnant, nonlactating
women at least aged 18 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant melanoma of any origin
(skin, mucosal, uveal) with evidence of inoperable locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis and having a life
expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Patients were required to
have measurable disease, with no other current active
malignancies and no brain metastases noted on screening
assessments. Patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1, hemoglobin 9 g/dL, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
1.5  109/L, a platelet count 100  109/L, serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, total bilirubin 2 mg/dL, and hepatic transaminases <2.5 the upper limit of normal. If
female, the patient must have been practicing adequate
birth control methods.
Patients were excluded from the trial if they had evidence of brain metastases, had a preexisting grade 2 or
higher peripheral neuropathy, had received prior radiation to a target lesion (unless there has been clear progression of the lesion since radiotherapy), had a history of
allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drug, had a clinically significant concurrent illness, were unlikely to complete the study, or were enrolled in a different clinical
study. A washout period from the last dose of any prior

therapy for melanoma of 28 days was required before initiation of therapy for the previously treated cohort.
Study Design
nab-Paclitaxel was supplied by Abraxis BioScience (Los
Angeles, Calif) and was administered as intravenous infusions over 30 minutes weekly for 3 weeks followed by
1 week of rest (28-day cycles) on an outpatient basis.
Patients who had been previously treated with cytotoxic
chemotherapy were entered into the previously treated
cohort, and patients with no previous chemotherapy treatment were entered into the chemotherapy-naive cohort.
Patients with a history of bio- or immunotherapy as adjuvant treatment for their metastatic disease were accepted
for treatment in both groups. Weekly doses were 100 mg/
m2 for the previously treated cohort and 150 mg/m2 for
the chemotherapy-naive cohort. A dose escalation of 25mg/m2 was permitted in Cycle 2 and onward for the
previously treated cohort in the absence of dose-limiting
toxicities. nab-Paclitaxel was initially administered without antiemetics, antihistamines, or corticosteroids, but
the use of antiemetics was permitted at the investigator’s
discretion based on patient tolerance. Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) treatment was permitted
for neutropenic fever or sepsis.
Patients were withdrawn from the study in the event
they developed progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, if they refused therapy, or at the investigator’s
discretion.
Safety and efficacy analyses were performed on the
treated population (ie, all randomized patients who
received at least 1 dose of study drug).
For the evaluation of safety and tolerability, investigator-assessed incidences of treatment-emergent and
treatment-related adverse events were reported as well as
laboratory abnormalities; nadir of myelosuppression; and
incidence of patients experiencing dose modifications,
dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of
study drug.
The confirmed overall response rate and disease control rate were summarized by the number and percentage
of patients who achieved response as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Disease
control was defined as having confirmed complete or partial overall response or stable disease for at least 16 weeks.
PFS and OS were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods.
For PFS, patients who did not develop disease progression
and had not died were censored at the last known time the

Cancer

patient was free of disease progression. Patients who initiated new anticancer therapy before disease progression
were censored at the time the new anticancer therapy
was initiated. As a measure of duration of response, PFS
was analyzed in patients with confirmed overall
response. Exploratory comparisons of PFS and OS by
baseline level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were
based on the log-rank test.
Assessments
Blood counts and chemistries were measured weekly to
assess bone marrow and hepatic and renal function. In the
case of myelosuppression, nab-paclitaxel was not administered until ANC and platelet counts had recovered to
1.5  109/L and 100  109/L, respectively. Before
dosing within a treatment cycle (Weeks 2 and 3 of each
cycle), ANC and platelet counts were required to be 1.0
 109/L and 75  109/L, respectively. Tumor imaging
studies were performed at baseline; with radiographic
restaging performed every 8 weeks for the first 3 assessments, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Response was
assessed using RECIST criteria.20 Toxicity was graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). Treatment-related toxicities were those toxicities considered by
the investigators to be possibly, probably, or definitely
related to nab-paclitaxel. PFS and OS were analyzed using
Kaplan-Meier methods. Exploratory comparisons of PFS
and OS by baseline level of LDH were based on the logrank test.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Seventy-four patients enrolled in the study and received at
least 1 dose of nab-paclitaxel (Table 1). Of 37 patients in
the previously treated group, 35 patients received prior
chemotherapy, 1 patient received prior neoadjuvant therapy, 4 patients received prior adjuvant therapy, and 31
patients received prior metastatic therapy (mean number
of prior metastatic chemotherapy regimens, 2.1  1.48).
Patients enrolled in this clinical trial had mainly visceral
metastasis (70% among previously treated patients and
81% among chemotherapy-naive patients) and baseline
LDH levels above the upper limit of normal (62% among
previously treated patients and 51% among chemotherapy-naive patients), demonstrating a population of
patients with poor prognosis. All patients had an ECOG
performance status at baseline of 1.

Treatment Administration
Patients received a median of 4.0 cycles of nab-paclitaxel
(range, 1-27 cycles); >50% of the patients in each cohort
received 4 treatment cycles (21 [57%] of the patients in
the previously treated cohort and 22 [59%] of the patients
in the chemotherapy-naive cohort). Seventeen patients in
the previously treated cohort had their dose increased to
125 mg/m2 at Cycle 2 or later as permitted per protocol.
There were 8 (22%) previously treated patients and 19
(51%) chemotherapy-naive patients with at least 1 dose
reduction, and 10 (27%) previously treated patients and
19 (51%) chemotherapy-naive patients with at least 1
dose delay. There were no dose interruptions during the
study. The mean percentage of protocol dose was 91.3%
for previously treated patients and 84.9% for chemotherapy-naive patients.
Patients were not pretreated with antihistamines or
steroids in either cohort, but 17 (46%) patients in the previously treated and 9 (24%) patients in the chemotherapy-naive group received antiemetics.
Safety
Treatment-emergent and treatment-related grade 3 and 4
toxicities are noted in Table 2. The most frequently

158

reported toxicities were anemia (mostly grade 1), sensory
neuropathy, fatigue, leukopenia, and neutropenia. These
events were generally more prominent in patients in the
chemotherapy-naive group receiving a dose of 150 mg/m2
of the drug. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was experienced by
41% of the patients in the chemotherapy-naive group and
14% in the previously treated group. Only 1 patient in
either group experienced febrile neutropenia.
nab-Paclitaxel was well tolerated in this patient
population. Grade 3 sensory neuropathy was experienced
by 2 patients in the previously treated group and 6
patients in the chemotherapy-naive group; 1 patient discontinued therapy because of the event, 1 patient was
dose-reduced and then discontinued therapy after another
grade 3 neuropathy, 3 patients were dose-reduced and
continued therapy, and 3 patients discontinued therapy at
the time of the neuropathy for other reasons (progressive
disease or other toxicity). There was 1 instance of grade 4
sensory neuropathy in the chemotherapy-naive cohort.
(The patient developed grade 3 neuropathy after 3 full
cycles at full dose. Cycle 4 was initiated at a reduced dose,
and the patient was dosed twice, but the neuropathy worsened to a grade 4 at 2 weeks after the 11th dose. The
patient then discontinued therapy because of this event.)
Overall, 19% percent of the patients in the chemotherapy-naive group had grade 3 or 4 sensory neuropathy,
compared with 5% in the previously treated group.
None of the patients experienced a serious hypersensitivity reaction. Eight (22%) patients in the chemotherapy-naive group discontinued because of unacceptable
toxicity, usually neuropathy or myelosuppression.
Activity
The confirmed complete or partial overall response rate
was 2.7% (1 of 37 patients) for the previously treated
cohort (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.1-14.2%)
and 21.6% (8 of 37 patients) for the chemotherapy-naive
cohort (95% CI, 8.4%-34.9%) (Table 3). All responses
were partial responses. The duration of response for the
previously treated patient was 12.9 months; for the chemotherapy-naive patients, the median duration of response
was 24.9 months, and the individual values for the 8
patients in months were 3.9 (censored), 10.0 (censored),
10.8, 13.6, 18.7, 25.5 (censored), 26.8 (censored), and
31.2 months, respectively. The sites of disease in the responders were lung, lymph node with or without soft tissue, abdomen, brain, liver, and peritoneum.

had stable disease for at least 16 weeks. A large proportion
of patients in this clinical trial had a confirmed response
or stable disease for 16 weeks while receiving nab-paclitaxel (37.8% of patients in the previously treated group
and 48.6% of patients in the chemotherapy-naive group
[95% CI, 22.2-53.5% and 32.5-64.8%, respectively]).
The median PFS was 3.5 months for the previously
treated cohort (95% CI, 1.7-5.6 months) and 4.5 months
for the chemotherapy-naive cohort (95% CI, 3.4-6.7
months) (Table 3) (Fig. 1). The PFS probabilities at
16 weeks were .3784 for the previously treated group,
.5392 for the chemotherapy-naive group, and .4726
across all patients. The median OS was 12.1 months for
previously treated patients and 9.6 months for chemotherapy-naive patients (95% CI, 6.5-17.5 months and
6.7-23.7 months, respectively) (Table 3) (Fig. 2). The
probability of being alive and free of disease progression

at 6 months was 27% for the previously treated cohort
and 34% for the chemotherapy-naive cohort; the probability of surviving 1 year was 49% and 41% for the
previously treated and chemotherapy-naive cohorts,
respectively.
As anticipated from other recent studies,4 an exploratory analysis indicated that the baseline level of LDH was
associated with longer PFS and OS in the chemotherapynaive patients with normal baseline LDH compared with
those with an elevated baseline LDH (P ¼ .027 and P ¼
.018, respectively) (Table 3). For example, the OS of the
chemotherapy-naive patients with normal LDH was 26.5
months, compared with 5.6 months in patients with elevated LDH. In the previously treated cohort, PFS was also
found to be significantly longer in patients with normal
baseline LDH compared with patients with elevated
LDH (P ¼ .012).

The time to the initiation of the next program of
therapy after cessation of nab-paclitaxel therapy was
examined. In the chemotherapy-naive group, 43% of
patients went for 2 months without new therapy, 19%
went for 6 months, and 11% went 12 months (Fig. 3).
Overall, 10 previously treated and 16 chemotherapy-naive
patients had remarkably slow progression after disease recurrence, ranging from 2 to 23 months.

DISCUSSION
MM remains a very challenging entity for treatment with
a known short survival. Thus, in several large studies, the
overall median survival has ranged from 6.2 to 7.8
months, and disease progression is usually rapid and unrelenting. In a recent meta-analysis of a large number of

phase 2 cooperative group trials, the median OS in
patients with MM was 6.2 months, and the median PFS
was 1.7 months.21
nab-Paclitaxel was investigated in the current study
because, in a phase 1 study of this formulation given on the
schedule of weekly for 3 of 4 weeks, hints of activity including tumor shrinkage and declines in an initially elevated serum LDH value were noted. In addition, nab-paclitaxel is
at least as active against a variety of metastatic cancers as
Cremophor-formulated paclitaxel.14 It is approved for the
treatment of metastatic breast cancer and is currently under
study for other cancers, including lung cancer, head and
neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, and others.
The current clinical trial enrolled a majority of
patients with poor-prognosis MM, as determined by
elevated LDH and metastasis to visceral organs. Despite
this, in both the previously treated and the chemotherapy-naive groups of patients, the PFS and the OS were
longer than would have been anticipated from prior
studies of other chemotherapeutic agents. The PFS was
3.5 months and 4.5 months, respectively, in the previously treated and chemotherapy-naive patients, whereas
in the literature the PFS in MM patients treated with
dacarbazine or temozolomide has been reported to be
approximately 1.6 months.5,6 Similarly, the OS
was 12.1 months for previously treated patients and
9.6 months for chemotherapy-naive patients, which is
considerably longer than the median survival of <8
months reported for patients treated with dacarbazine or
temozolomide. In this small study, the PFS at 6 months
and the OS at 1 year were higher compared with the
results of a recent review of 42 clinical trials including

greater than 2100 patients with MM participating in
studies from cooperative groups between 1975 and
2005.21 It has been proposed that single-arm clinical trials
that demonstrate either a PFS at 6 months >30% or an
OS at 1 year >45% are useful endpoints for the selection
of regimens to be then tested in phase 3 clinical trials.21
The transcytosis of nab-paclitaxel across the endothelial membrane of the blood vessel to the site of the
tumor is facilitated by the binding of albumin to the gp60
receptor and caveolar transport.15,22,23 After entering the
interstitial space adjacent to tumors, the accumulation of
nab-paclitaxel is possibly mediated by SPARC (Secreted
Protein, Acidic and Rich in Cysteine),24-26 an albuminbinding protein with significant homology to gp60,
which, when overexpressed, is associated with a poor
prognosis in a large number of cancers, including melanoma.26,27 This may be in part responsible for an increase
in intratumoral concentration of paclitaxel,28,29 with resultant improved efficacy.
Another interesting feature of the course of patients
treated with nab-paclitaxel is the slow progression or long
stabilization of disease in a substantial number of patients.
Ten previously treated and 16 chemotherapy-naive
patients had remarkably slow progression after disease recurrence (range, 2-23 months). This might indicate a
change in the biology of the tumor. Approximately 11%
of the chemotherapy-naive patients were stable for at least
12 months, and for as long as 23 months, after cessation
of therapy, despite having radiographically documented
persistence of disease.
Taxanes have demonstrated moderate activity in
melanoma in several previously reported studies, with
response rates reported to range from 12% to 16%.8-13 In
addition, preliminary results of a large phase 2 randomized clinical trial testing a combined regimen of paclitaxel
and carboplatin, with or without sorafenib, in patients
with previously treated MM yielded a response rate of
11% to 12%,30 thereby confirming some antitumor
activity of taxane-containing regimens in patients with
this disease. Indeed, the OS of the patients receiving the
combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel in the abovementioned study was similar to that of patients in the current study. The toxicity of Cremophor, particularly the
14% incidence of acute hypersensitivity reactions, is a
well-known, dose-limiting toxicity. The albumin-bound
particle formulation of the drug avoids this toxicity, and
the drug can be given without any premedication.
The most common and most severe toxicities
noted with the drug are neuropathy and neutropenia,

although the majority of patients develop alopecia as
well. Toxicity in terms of neuropathy was greater in the
chemotherapy-naive group, presumably because of the
higher dose of drug administered compared with the
previously treated group. At the current time, dose
interruption and dose reduction are effective interventions for neuropathy, although therapy eventually needs
to be terminated in a small fraction of the patients. If
neutropenia of grade 3 develops, it can be managed
with filgrastim treatment on Days 2 to 5 or Days 2 to 6
after each dose of nab-paclitaxel. Because thrombocytopenia was not a problem with this agent, and because
the neutropenia is modest and can usually be reversed
with growth-factor treatment, we believe an important
pathway for the further development of this drug is in
combination with other therapies for melanoma, including those that may be myelosuppressive.
Overall, nab-paclitaxel was well tolerated and active
in patients with MM. Both the response rate and PFS
compared favorably with standard dacarbazine therapy,
prior reports of single-agent paclitaxel therapy, other regimens such as combination chemotherapy, and various
other therapies for previously treated patients.
nab-Paclitaxel should be evaluated further in both
chemotherapy-naive and previously treated patients with
MM as both single-agent therapy and in combination
with other chemotherapy, biologic therapy, and targeted
therapy. Because the PFS and OS of the patients in the
previously treated group who received 100 mg/m2 of nabpaclitaxel was similar to that of the chemotherapy-naive
group receiving 150 mg/m2 of nab-paclitaxel, it may be
that future randomized clinical trials of nab-paclitaxel
should use the dose of 100 mg/m2.
