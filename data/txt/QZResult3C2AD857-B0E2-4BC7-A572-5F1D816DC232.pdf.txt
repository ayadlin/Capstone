ABSTRACT
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a therapeutic target (oncotarget)
in NSCLC. Using in vitro EGFR kinase activity system, we identified a novel small
molecule, WB-308, as an inhibitor of EGFR. WB-308 decreased NSCLC cell proliferation
and colony formation, by causing G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, WB-308
inhibited the engraft tumor growths in two animal models in vivo (lung orthotopic
transplantation model and patient-derived engraft mouse model). WB-308 impaired
the phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and ERK1/2 protein. WB-308 was less cytotoxic
than Gefitinib. Our study suggests that WB-308 is a novel EGFR-TKI and may be
considered to substitute for Gefitinib in clinical therapy for NSCLC.

cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is typically diagnosed
at advanced stages [2, 3]. With regards to lung cancer
mortality, 80%–90% of these cases are associated with
metastasis and one of the most common cases is bone
metastasis [4, 5]. Among lung cancer bone metastasis,
the most frequent target organ is the vertebral column,
which causes even more severe consequences to patients’
recovery rate and life quality [6, 7].
Growing evidence reveals that epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a pivotal role in
tumorigenesis, drug resistance, relapse and the metastasis
of various cancers [8–11]. As one of the most common
cell-surface receptor of the epidermal growth factor
family (EGF-family) of extracellular protein ligands, the
epidermal growth factor receptor belongs to the ErbB
family of receptors [12]. The downstream signaling proteins

INTRODUCTION
Despite the large number of clinical trials aimed
at improving patients’ survival, lung cancer remains the
leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide
in both men and women. Lung cancer is composed
of two main types; one type is non-small-cell lung
cancers (NSCLCs; 80% of all lung cancers), including
adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and large
cell carcinomas, and the other type is the small-cell lung
cancers, exhibiting neuroendocrine features. According
to the latest report, the average 5-year survival rate for
NSCLC is only 16% [1]. Over half of lung cancer cases
are diagnosed after metastasis, for which the median
survival time is approximately 8 months. Approximately
80% of all lung cancer cases are categorized as non-small

involved with several signal transduction cascades, such as
the MAPK, Akt, ERK1/2 and JNK pathways, are triggered
by EGFR autophosphorylation. Additionally, they are
associated with tumorigenesis based on their carcinogenic
effects on DNA synthesis and properties that promote
cell proliferation [13]. Meanwhile, mutations that result
in EGFR overexpression or over-activity have also been
implicated in a number of cancers, including lung cancer,
in particular non-small cell lung cancer [14]. Given that
EGFR is one of the most commonly mutated genes in
NSCLC [15], EGFR has been considered as an important
target for NSCLC therapeutics [16]. Meanwhile, Gefitinib
is considered to be the primary selective EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) for NSCLC therapy, which operates
by repression of EGFR oncogenic signaling [17].
Drug resistance to Gefitinib treatment is mostly a
result of mutations occurring within the kinase domain
of EGFR. Since Paez JG initially reported that EGFRrelated mutations alter the effects of drug therapy,
additional drug resistant molecular mechanisms have been
revealed [17]. Among those, EGFR-TKIs mutations that
alter drug sensitivity commonly occur at exons 18–21,
in which 49% contain the exon 19 del (Del E746-A750)
mutation and 45% of these EGFR mutations contain the

point mutation L858R in exon 21 [18]. These two types
of EGFR mutations increase the kinase activity of EGFR,
thus resulting in increased sensitivity of NSCLC patients
to EGFR-TKIs clinical treatment. Furthermore, not all
mutations lead to an increase in sensitivity to treatment.
For instance, mutations that involve insertions at exon
20 impart resistance to the EGFR-TKIs. Nearly half
the drug-resistant NSCLC patients possess the T790M
mutation in exon 20 of EGFR, which has been considered
the main cause of drug resistance [19]. A secondary
mutation at T790M in EGFR has also been associated with
drug resistance, as well as Met amplification [20]. Most
mutations, except T790M or Met amplification, may be
eradicated with the appropriate choice and combinations
of second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such
as Erlotinib and Afatinib. However, there is still no
effective TKI available for NSCLC with the T790M and
Met amplification mutations. Therefore, it is of great
significance to develop new small molecules targeting
EGFR that can overcome the chemotherapy resistance to
combat lung cancer, especially the NSCLC.
In this study, we screened a chemical library of
novel compounds synthesized in our lab and identified a
novel compound, entitled WB-308 (Figure 1A). WB-308

antibodies. (E) WB-308’s inhibition to the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 was directly through EGFR but not Insulin receptor. PC-9

respectively, for another hour. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting analysis with antibodies as indicated.

is a potent inhibitor that is effective against wide type
and mutant EGFR kinase activity, and in turn, exhibits
impressive anti-cancer activities for NSCLC. Additionally,
our results establishes that the unique properties of WB308 rely on its diminished cytotoxicity when compared to
existing EGFR inhibitory compounds, such as Gefitinib.

HCC-827 to test the effect of WB-308 on EGF-induced
EGFR phosphorylation by Western blot analysis. A549
exemplifies the wild type EGFR kinase prototype, while
PC-9 possesses the 19 del (Del E746-A750) mutation of
EGFR, and NCI-H1975, NCI-H1650, and HCC-827 all
contain EGFR with T790M and L858R mutations.
Our data showed that EGF (20 ng/mL for 30 min)
strongly stimulated the phosphorylation of EGFR protein
in 5 NSCLC cells while WB-308 reduced EGF-induced
EGFR phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner
in these NSCLC cell lines (Figure 1D for A549, PC-9,
NCI-H1975 and S1A for NCI-H1650 and HCC-827). And
WB-308 at 10 μM fully blocked EGFR phosphorylation.
Meanwhile, after the treatment of EGF at 20 ng/mL for
30 min, the phosphorylation levels of AKT and ERK1/2
decreased accordingly in the same manner as p-EGFR,
while the total amount of these signaling proteins were
not affected (Figure 1D and Figure S1A). These results
confirm the fact that WB-308 inhibited EGFR and its
downstream signaling pathways.
To further confirm that WB-308’s inhibition to
the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 was directly
through EGFR, but not through other cytokine receptor
pathways, we conducted the same experiments using
EGFR and Insulin, both in PC-9 cells. Insulin did not
serve as the ligand for EGFR and would not induce
the phosphorylation of EGFR, but it could cause the
phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 [23]. As showed
in Figure 1E, after the stimulation of EGF (20 ng/mL),
the phosphorylation of EGFR and its’ downstream
signaling proteins remarkably increased and WB-308
significantly inhibited this increase in a dose-dependent
manner. However, in the presence of Insulin (100 nM),
although the phosphorylation level of EGFR stood
steadily, the phosphorylation levels of AKT and ERK1/2
were up-regulated obviously. Furthermore, pre-treatment
of WB-308 failed to inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT
and ERK1/2 (Figure 1E). Taken together, all these results
indicate that WB-308 impaired the phosphorylation of
EGFR as well as the phosphorylation of many EFGR
signaling pathway proteins in NSCLC cells, therefore
it can be identified as an novel small molecular EGFR
inhibitor.

RESULTS
Screening for EGFR signaling inhibitors
For screening of EGFR signaling inhibitors for lung
cancer therapy, we downloaded the x-ray crystal structure
of EGFR kinase domain from the Protein Data Bank, and
Autodock4.2 software package was employed to perform
the molecular docking modeling assay. From a compound
library of over 50 different compounds for the potential
inhibitors of kinase activity of EGFR synthesized in our
lab, a novel small molecular weight 308, namely WB308, was found to be directly bound with EGFR kinase
active site in the pocket domain. Figure 1A showed the
chemical structure of WB-308 (Figure 1A, left) and
Gefitinib (Figure 1A, right) while Figure 1B demonstrated
the molecular docking modeling result (Figure 1B). From
Figure 1B it could be concluded that the small molecular
WB-308 (green), like Gefitinib (amaranth), inserted into
EGFR pocket domain, which was located at the kinase
active site, thus destroying the kinase activity of EGFR
(Figure 1B). Furthermore, both the two small molecules
exhibited approximately the same binding energy with
EGFR. The above results strongly suggest that EGFR may
function as an EGFR inhibitor, thereby serving the same
role as Gefitinib.

Inhibition of EGFR kinase activity of WB-308
According to the aforementioned bio-informatic
analysis suggestions, the EGFR kinase assay was carried
out in the presence of WB-308 or the well-known EGFR
protein kinase inhibitor Gefitinib. As shown in Figure 1C,
the kinase activity inhibition IC50 for Gefitinib was nearly
21 nM (Figure 1C), which is consistent with a previous
report [21]. The inhibition IC50 for WB-308 was about 43
nM (Figure 1C), suggesting WB-308 directly inhibited
the kinase activity of EGFR at a concentration similar to
Gefitinib.

WB-308 exerts the same molecular mechanism
with Gefitinib in EGFR mutated NSCLC cells
It has been previously reported that EGFR-TKIs
drug sensitivity-related mutations commonly occur at
exons 18–21, 49% of which are exon 19 del (Del E746–
A750) mutations, and 45% of which contain the L858R
mutation at exon 21. When these two types of EGFR
mutations are present, NSCLC cell’s sensitivity to clinical
chemotherapy drugs, including Gefitinib, increases [24]. To
confirm that WB-308 operates via the same mechanism as
Gefitinib in response to EGFR mutations, we employed a

WB-308 suppresses the EGFR signaling pathway
in NSCLC cells
Previous studies revealed that cytokines like EGF
could induce the activation of EGFR kinase activity
and up-regulate the phosphorylation of downstream
signaling pathways, including ERK1/2 and AKT pathways
[22]. Herein we employed 5 different NSCLC cells,
including A549, PC-9, NCI-H1975, NCI-H1650, and

de novo system to test WB-308’s working model in wild
type NSCLC cell line H1299 in order to exclude artificial
results and background. Considering the mutant efficiency
and experiment simplicity, we chose the L858R mutation
to confirm our result because to construct a point mutant
is much easier that to construct a deletion mutant. We
established stable cell lines that could stably express WT
EGFR and L858R-mutated EGFR by transfecting with
plasmid constructs in NCI-H1299 cells, which is an EGFR
low-expressed cell line. The empty vector plasmid was
employed as negative control in this experiment. Western
blotting analysis demonstrated that these 3 stable cell
lines, namely H1299 (vector), H1299 (EGFR–WT), and
H1299 (EGFR–L858R), were successfully established
(Figure 2A). Next we treated these cells with WB-308 and
Gefitinib, respectively. Within our expectations, WB-308
showed the same effects as Gefitinib, further emphasizing
the same effective model, and inhibited the phosphorylation
of EGFR–L858R more than that of EGFR-WT, in a dose
dependent manner. At a concentration of 0.5 μM, WB-308
decreased the level of p-EGFR of EGFR-L858R stable
cells even more severely than that in EGFR-WT stable
cells at the concentration of 5 μM, which indicated that the
NSCLC cell’s sensitivity to WB-308 increased after EGFR
mutation occurred (Figure 2B).
Provided the model that WB-308 inhibits EGFR
signaling pathway to different degrees in the EGFR-WT
cell and EGFR-L858R cell, we examined whether WB308 suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation to different
degrees using the SRB assay, too. As shown in Figure 2C,
like Gefitinib, WB-308 had inhibitive effects on H1299
(vector), H1299 (EGFR-WT), and H1299 (EGFR–L858R)

cells, however, the inhibition effect to H1299 (EGFR–
L858R) cell was the most dramatic. For example, at a
concentration of 5 μM, the percentages of cell viability
of H1299 (vector) and H1299 (EGFR-WT) were about
80%, while that of H1299 (EGFR–L858R) dramatically
decreased to 40% (Figure 2C), which further confirmed
that like Gefitinib, NSCLC cell’s sensitivity to WB308 also increased after the EGFR L858R mutation
was present. In summary, WB-308 operates via a
similar molecular mechanism as Gefitinib, and could be
considered a substitute for Gefitinib.

WB-308 exhibits evidences to be a better
EGFR inhibitor than Gefitinib
The aforementioned results suggest that WB-308
inhibits the proliferation of NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we
questioned if WB-308 had ideal selective effects between
NSCLC cells and healthy human lung tissue cells, such
as the human lung fibroblast cell MRC-5, and the normal
human lung epithelial cells including HFL1, IMR-90 and
BEAS-2B, compared to Gefitinib. Eleven NSCLC cell
lines, including HCC-827, PC-9, NCI-H1650, SPC-A1,
A549, NCI-H1975 and HCC-827GR, together with the
human normal lung tissue cells MRC-5, HFL1, IMR-90
and BEAS-2B, were utilized to conduct the cell viability
assay. A549 and SPC-A1 represent the wild type EGFR
while in PC-9 the 19 del (Del E746–A750) mutation of
EGFR occurs, and NCI-H1975, NCI-H1650, and HCC827 all three possess the T790M mutation of EGFR.
HCC-827GR cells contain Met amplification after the
T790M mutation occurred. SRB assay results clearly

showed that the half maximal inhibitory concentration
for WB-308 inhibition of NSCLC cellular proliferation
was approximately 5 μM, while that of 4 human
normal lung tissue cells were much more than 100 μM
(Figure 3). In short, WB-308 was more toxic to NSCLC
cells than to normal lung tissue cells. Meanwhile, WB308 at all concentrations caused less cytotoxicity to
4 human normal lung tissue cells than did Gefitinib
(Figure 3 for MRC-5, HFL1, IMR-90 and BEAS-2B),
which suggested that WB-308 had higher levels of biosafety than Gefitinib. Although in these 6 EGFR-WT
or EGFR-mutated cells, WB-308 showed comparable
effects to Gefitinib, regardless of cell type. In each of
EGFR-WT cells (SPC-A1 and A549), EGFR T790M
mutant cells (NCI-H1975), or in Met-amplification cells
(HCC-827GR), WB-308 caused severe inhibition effects
when compared with Gefitinib (Figure 3), indicating that
WB-308 should have less toxicity. Therefore, it can be
considered that WB-308 has unique properties compared
to the existing EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib and may serve as
a better EGFR inhibitor than Gefitinib.

decreased number of colonies with the increase of WB-308
concentration (Figure 4A, the upper panel). The bottom
panel of Figure 4A illustrates the enlarged view of the
respective colony. Figure 4B, 4D and 4E show the statistic
results of each colony formation assay, according to the
diagram of colony numbers and colony diameters. The 3-D
colony formation morphology results are demonstrated in
Figure 4C. From Figure 4 we can summarize that WB-308
inhibits colony formation of NSCLC cells.

WB-308 induces NSCLC cell apoptosis
and arrests NSCLC cells at G2/M phase
To further identify whether WB-308 could induce
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, we performed realtime PCR analysis by probing the expression levels of
the following genes: p21, Bcl-2, Bax, Cyclin D1, and
Cyclin D3, all of which are typical markers related with
cell apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoints. As shown in
Figure 5A, WB-308 had little effect on these typical
proteins’ mRNA levels in MRC-5 cells, but had
tremendous influences on PC-9, A549, and H1975
cells. The mRNA levels of p21, Bcl-2, Cyclin D1 and
Cyclin D3 were down-regulated while that of Bax were
upregulated (Figure 5A). Meanwhile, we immunoblotted
the protein levels of apoptosis marker genes, such as
PARP and Caspase-3. Figure 5B demonstrates that
our hypothesis was proven correct. In PC-9 cells, the
cleaved PARP and cleaved Caspase-3 protein levels
correlated directly to increasing concentrations of
WB-308. However, in MRC-5 cells, the situation was
different (Figure 5B). Next we examined the effects
of WB-308 on the cell cycle through analysis by flow
cytometry. Nocodazole treatment was performed for
cell cycle synchronization and subsequent release, and

WB-308 inhibits colony formation
of NSCLC cells
Two kinds of colony formation assays were
performed to test the inhibition effect of WB-308 to
NSCLC cell proliferation. One was the 2-D colony
formation assay and the other was the 3-D colony
formation assay. As Figure 4 shows, WB-308 inhibited
colony formation of NSCLC cells in a concentrationdependent manner, and showed a very significant
difference compared to the control group when at
10 μM. In Figure 4A, after being seeded in 6 cm dishes and
colony formatted for 2 weeks, SPC-A1 cells displayed a

then we tracked the cell cycle distribution at different
time points. Results showed that WB-308 remarkably
changed the cell cycle, when compared with the vehicle
control group (Figure 5C). Statistically, we found that
WB-308 increased cell numbers at G2/M phase from

about 60% to nearly 80% as its release time increased
from 0 hr to 5 hrs in PC-9 cell while the vehicle group
didn’t increase but instead decreased (Figure 5D). In
short, our data elucidated that WB-308 induced cell
apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase.

growth in vivo

these three groups, suggesting low compound toxicity. We
also dissected mice following sacrifice, and the anatomy
results showed no obvious pathological effect on the main
organs (data not shown). Together, our data indicates that
administration of WB-308 therapeutically blocked NSCLC
tumor growth.
Western blot results shows that compared with
control mice tumors, the phosphorylation of EGFR and
ERK1/2 decreased in WB-308-injected mice tumors in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 6C), suggesting that WB308 could suppress the EGFR pathway in vivo. Similar
results were obtained from the analysis of Ki-67 and BclxL expression, which were well-known classical tumor
cell proliferation markers (Figure 6C). Taken together,
these in vivo immunohistochemistry results were in
agreement with our in vitro results and indicated that WB308 suppressed NSCLC tumor growth by suppressing the
EGFR signaling pathway.

The in vivo effects of WB-308 on NSCLC were
rigorously tested using animal models. First, we evaluated
the inhibitory effect of WB-308 on PC-9 orthotopic tumor
growth model in vivo. Initially, we constructed a luciferaseexpressing PC-9 cell line (PC-9-luc). Upon orthotopic
injection into mice lungs from day 0–28, PC-9-luc cells
exhibit bioluminescence which is traced by photon flux
indexes, in turn representing the tumor sizes with use of
the IVIS 2000 Luminal Imager system. Mice were divided
into 3 groups (n = 10 per group) and treated with WB-308
at 10 mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day or vehicle control. In the
control mice, tumor cells were detected in the lung regions
with high levels of bioluminescence, which increased
remarkably with day number increase (Figure 6A, the upper
panel). Treatment with WB-308 statistically reduced the
photo flux indexes (Figure 6A, the middle and the bottom
panel, Figure 6B). As Figure 6B showed, at day 28 the nude
mice were sacrificed. The average normalized photon flux
of the 10 mg/kg/day WB-308 treated group and 50 mg/kg/
day WB-308 treated group was 8 × 106 ± 0.76 p/sec/cm2/sr
and 0.18 × 106 ± 0.03 p/sec/cm2/sr, respectively, while
that of vehicle control group was 28 × 106 ± 0.32 p/sec/
cm2/sr (Figure 6B). Moreover, no statistically significant
difference in mouse body weight was detected among

WB-308 inhibits the growth of patient-derived
NSCLC tumor xenografts
Next, we clinically examined the effect of WB308 on NSCLC tumors. It has been widely accepted that
patient-derived tumor xenograft models can be utilized
as an ideal drug-screening tool for many kinds of cancer
therapy [25–27], including therapy of lung cancer [28].

DISCUSSION

Lung cancer usually causes bone metastases, especially
the vertebral metastasis. Thus, we employed a patientderived NSCLC cell line, which was primarily separated
from an advanced NSCLC patient’s spinal metastasis
in Changzheng Hospital (Shanghai, China), to test if
WB-308 could be clinically beneficial. First, the SRB
assay was performed to identify the effects of WB-308
on this patient-derived NSCLC cell line. As shown in
supplymentary Figure 1B, WB-308 inhibited the cell
proliferation of this cancer cell line in a dose-dependent
manner, and Gefitinib was used here as a positive control
(Figure S1B). Then, we injected this cancer cell line
into nude mice to establish the patient-derived NSCLC
tumor xenograft model. Mice were divided into 3 groups
(n = 10 per group) and treated with WB-308 at 10 mg/
kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day or vehicle control. At the
day 27, mice were sacrificed and the tumor xenograft of
each mouse was dissected (Figure 7A). The average tumor
volume of control group was 654 ± 190 mm3, whereas
tumor size in WB-308-treated group was 289 ± 132 mm3
for 10 mg/kg/day group and 107 ± 46 mm3 for 50 mg/
kg/day group, respectively. And statistical results showed
a significant difference between the drug-treated groups
and the control group (Figure 7B), especially for the 50
mg/kg/day group, the tumor burden of each mouse almost
ceased to grow following the administration of WB-308
(Figure 7B). At the same time, treatment of WB-308 at
the given concentration still had little effect on the body
weights of the WB-308-treated mice, when compared to
the control group (Figure 7C), which further confirmed
that WB-308 had low toxicity to mice at the curative dose.

The EGFR signaling pathway has been shown
to promote tumor progression in many types of human
cancers [29]. EGFR plays a critical role in regulating
cancer cell growth and survival, representing an attractive
therapeutic target in NSCLC and compounds serve as
EGFR-TKIs are attracting even more and more attention
[30]. The first-generation EGFR-TKIs, such as Gefitinib,
have proven to be highly effective for advanced NSCLC.
Although these small molecular targeted agents provide
a significant response and survival benefit, all responders
eventually acquire chemotherapy resistance [31]. What’s
more, when considering the clinical benifits of Gefitinib,
the assessment with evidence of the efficacy and toxicity
of the treatment of NSCLC is one of the most capital
factors restraining its application in the course of treatment
[32]. Till now, many reports focus on both efficacy and
toxicity of the current state of Gefitinib therapy in NSCLC
patients, and some typical adverse effects have been
revealed [33, 34]. Unanswered questions about the optimal
use of Gefitinib still remain open.
To date, most of the known small molecular
EGFR-TKIs are anilinoquinazoline chemotypes, in­
cluding Gefitinib and Erlotinib. The primary objection
of our research is to expand the candidate scope of
leading compounds to substitute existing EGFR-TKIs,
especially Gefitinib. In this study, we identified a novel
small molecule inhibitor, WB-308, which targets the
kinase activity of EGFR and EGFR-mediated tumor
growth-associated gene expression. Moreover, WB-308

suppressed NSCLC cancer cell proliferation, cell viability,
and colony formation ability, and induced cell apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner. In two
different mouse tumor growth models, we also found
that WB-308 therapeutically blocked NSCLC tumor
growth by suppressing the EGFR signaling pathway. In
addition, the maximum effective concentration of WB308 (50 mg/kg/day) did not induce apparent toxicity to
mice. Functionally, WB-308 shows the same anti-cancer
activities as Gefitinib. However, upon comparing the
balance between efficacy and toxicity, the most significant
benefit of WB-308 over Gefitinib is that WB-308 exerts
less cytotoxicity, as observed upon treatment of the four
primary normal human lung tissue cell lines, MRC-5,
HFL1, IMR-90 and BEAS-2B. WB-308 also possesses a
novel chemical backbone structure, which is substantially
different from known typical EGFR-TKIs, which
provides a new structural scaffold for future modification
and development of potential anti-cancer agents against
NSCLC.
Various mechanisms of drug resistance have been
identified in NSCLC for EGFR-TKIs treatment. Small
in-frame deletions at exon 19 and point mutations within
exon 21 (L858R) are the most common EGFR-activating
mutations, which both lead to sustained kinase activity.
The EGFR-T790M secondary mutation is responsible for
half of the cases of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs
and Met amplification, which permits cell survival by
persistent activation of Akt signaling, has been described
for 5 to 15% of cases [20]. Upon WB-308 treatment
of different cell lines that harbor different types of
EGFR mutants, all lines reacted in the same manner to
Gefitinib. This result indicates that WB-308 has the same
efficacy and can be regarded as an ideal substitute for
Gefitinib. Furthermore, WB-308’s low toxicity suggests
that WB-308 might overcome the negative implications
of Gefitinib, allowing it to be a beneficial alternative
candidate for Gefitinib in clinic.
As for NSCLC, about 22%–64% of advanced lung
cancer patients will eventually develop bone metastasis
[35]. In this study, the patient-derived xenograft model
suggested that WB-308 may exert its function in
NSCLC patients. Because the cancer cells were derived
from patients’ spine metastatic tumors, they mimic the
process of cancer cell colony formation and migrate to
target bones in vivo. WB-308 functions sufficiently in
the NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model, thus may
provide evidence for its future clinical applications to cure
NSCLC bone metastasis patients.
However, this study still has a few limitations, and
further comprehensive development of the WB-308 model
is needed. Initially, we have only examined the influence
of WB-308 on the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK-MAPK signaling
pathway and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway,
and have yet not to acknowledge additional pathways,
such as the Src-JAK-STATs signaling pathway and the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PLCγ-PKC signaling pathway, all of which are
downstream of EGFR pathways and associated with
tumor growth. In order to fully understand the molecular
mechanism of WB-308 on the EGFR pathway, it is
necessary to ascertain whether WB-308 further influences
additional EGFR downstream signaling pathways.
Secondly, in the two different tumor growth mouse models,
we treated the mice only by intraperitoneal injection, not
oral or intravenous application of WB-308. The drug
metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics
of this compound need to be further investigated to
determine whether the amount of absorbed WB-308 is
enough to function in NSCLC patients. Meanwhile, the
indices of WB-308’s solubility, stabilization and biological
availability are all needed to be carefully confirmed.
Thirdly, when performing the animal model experiments,
we were not blind to the DMSO-treated control mice
and WB-308-treated mice, which could lead to biased
interpretation of the results. A randomized double-blind
controlled trial of WB-308 on animal model experiments
is going to be necessary. Finally, considering the role of
the EGFR signaling pathway in numerous human cancer
symptoms—for example, cancer metastasis, tumor
invasion and angiogenesis (not including tumor growth),
[29] as well as other types of tumors, including lung cancer
[36], breast cancer [37], prostate cancer [38], colon cancer
[39], gastric cancer [40], glioma [41], melanoma [42],
etc.—it is reasonable to speculate whether WB-308 may
have effects on EGFR signaling pathway-related human
cancer types. Careful evaluation will be further required
in these other EGFR-related cancer types. Regardless, to
firmly establish the clinical significance of WB-308, more
detailed tests are further needed.
In conclusion, our current preclinical study of
WB-308 demonstrated that WB-308, a novel small
molecule inhibitor, functions similarly to Gefitinib, and
impairs the kinase activity of EGFR, thus inhibiting
human NSCLC cell growth. Furthermore, mouse models
have indicated that systemic administration of WB-308
prevents the lung cancer cell xenograft model, especially
the patient-derived xenograft mouse model. Additionally,
WB-308 is unique for its diminished cytotoxicity levels
when compared to Gefitinib. We therefore conclude
that WB-308 may be considered an ideal substitute for
Gefitinib and have potential applications for clinical
treatment in NSCLC therapy.

Molecular docking modeling assay
The X-ray crystal structure of EGFR was obtained
from the Protein data bank (PDB) website (http://www.
rcsb.org/). The structures of the ligands were built and
energy minimized using the Chemoffice software package
(Cambridge). We used Autodock4.2 version developed
by the Scripps Research Institute and Olson lab for free
for docking experiments. All of the water molecules were
removed before the experiments so that our experiments
were performed under non-aqueous conditions. The
primary ligand bound to the binding pocket was the
chosen conformation for the active site. The picture was
prepared using Pymol 1.2R2 version.

SRB cell viability assay
SRB cell viability assays were performed by stained
with Sulforhodamine B. Briefly, 5000 cells per well were
seeded in 96-well plates. After 24 h, cells were exposed to
Gefitinib or different concentrations of WB-308 for 72 h.
Cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h at
4°C, washed five times with flowing water, and air-dried.
Cells were stained with 50 μL 0.4% (w/v) SRB for 20 min
at room temperature, washed five times with 1% acetic
acid, and air-dried. 100 μL 10 mM Tris was added per
well, and absorbance was measured at 515 nm.

In vitro EGFR kinase assay
The half maximal concentration (IC50) values of
WB-308 and positive control Gefitinib against EGFR
kinase activity were carried out using the Promega KinaseGlo kit (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol in the presence of 600 nM
ATP. Data were presented as means and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) from three independent experiments.

2-D colony formation assay
Cells were trypsinized and seeded 2000 per
well in 6-well dishes. Cells were allowed to attach
overnight and then exposed to Gefitinib or different
concentration of WB-308 for 7 days. After being fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room
temperature, cells were stained with 0.2% crystal violet.
The morphology of cell colonies was recorded with photo
imaging and the number of cell colonies were calculated

Western blotting analysis
Cells were lysed with radioimmuno-precipitation
(RIPA) buffer [(50 mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 150
mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100,

to untreated sample. Triplicate wells were set up for each
concentration.

tumor were devided into three groups (n = 10 per group)
randomly and from that day on, the luminal photos were
taken every 7 days and photon flux indexes which could
represent the orthotopic tumor sizes were recorded
every 5 days. WB-308 (10 mg/kg/day per mouse and
50 mg/kg/day per mouse) was injected intraperitoneally
every day. The control group was treated with dimethyl
sulfoxide. 28 days later, the mice were sacrificed,
and tumors in lungs were removed and images were
recorded. The growth rate curve of the tumor xenograft
was evaluated by determining the photon flux indexes.
The mouse body weight was measured every 3 days.
Lung tumor xenografts were fixed and prepared for
immunohistochemistry.

3-D colony formation assay
Cells were trypsinized and seeded at a concentration
of 2000 per well in 6-well dishes that were pretreated with
the mixture of media and agarose with the volume ratio
of 1:1. Additionally, the mixture also contained Gefitinib
or different concentration of WB-308. The cells were
cultivated in this media for 3 weeks. After the colonies
grew to a suitable volume, the morphology of cell colonies
was taken with photo imaging and the numbers of cell
colonies were calculated and analyzed as the ratio of the
number of treated samples to untreated sample. Triplicate
wells were set up for each concentration.

Patient-derived xenograft model

Cells were seeded in 6 cm dish initially. And 24 h
later, cells were treated with Nocodazole (100 ng/ml) for
16 hrs aiming to synchronize cell cycle at the same phase
and then release, then cells were exposed to Gefitinib or
different concentration of WB-308 for accordingly time.
After being washed with PBS and digested with trypsin,
adherent and floating cells were collected, washed once
with PBS, fixed in cold 70% ethanol overnight in 4°C.
After ethanol fixation, cells were washed once in PBS
and resuspended in PBS with 200 μg/ml RNAase and 50
μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) in the dark for 30 minutes.
Then cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS
Calibur; BD Biosciences).

This assay was performed as described previously
with few modifications [44]. Briefly, the patient-derived
cells were injected subcutaneously on the right back sides
of the mice (7 × 106 cells per mouse). After the tumors
reached about 100 mm3, we removed them from the
mice and dissected them into 30 little pieces, equally.
Then these 30 little tumor pieces were subcutaneously
transplantated into the right back sides of nude mice after
anaesthetized by Afferden, randomly. After the tumors
reached about 100 mm3, mice were divided into 3 groups
and received intralesional injection either with DMSO or
WB-308 (10 mg/kg/day per mouse and 50 mg/kg/day per
mouse) every day for 27 days. During the administration
of WB-308, the body weight and the tumor size of the
mice were monitored every 3 days. Mice were continually
observed until they were sacrificed [45].

Establishment of stably transfected cell

Immunohistochemistry staining

The EGFR-WT, EGFR-L858R and the vehicle
over-expressing plasmids were purchased from
Clontech. Generally, the full length EGFR-WT and
EGFR-L858R cDNA were cloned into the vehicle
vector pcDNCA3.1 to generated EGFR-WT and EGFRL858R over-expression plasmids. NCI-H1299 cells was
transiently transfected with the above 3 plasmids using
Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen, MD) and retained in medium
containing 10% FBS and 1 μg/ml puromycin to select
the stable transfected cells.

Immunohistochemistry was performed as reported
previously [46]. In brief, xenograft tumors in lungs
were excised, fixed, and embedded in paraffin. Sections
were stained with anti-proliferating marker Ki-67
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Bxl-xL (CST). And the
phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2 were also stained.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed according
to standard protocol. Images were taken with Leica
microscope (Leica, DM4000B). The results were analyzed
using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software [47].

Cell cycle distribution analysis

Statistical analysis

PC-9-luciferase cell orthotropic transplantation
xenograft model

Results were statistically analyzed using the
Student’s t-test with Microsoft Excel. All experiments
were repeated at least three times. A value of p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

PC-9-Luciferase cells (5 × 105) in 0.02 mL
liquids that were mixed with PBS and Matrigel were
orthotopically transplantated into the lung of nude mice
after anaesthetized by pentobarbital sodium. Seven
days later, based on photon flux indexes detected by
Xenogen IVIS 2000 Luminal Imagier, all mice bearing
