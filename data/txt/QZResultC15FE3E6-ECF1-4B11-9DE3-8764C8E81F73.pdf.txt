BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) recent decision to remove the indication of bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has fueled a debate in the breast cancer community. We conducted a survey to assess the perception of health care workers involved in the management of women with MBC on the FDA’s
decision to ascertain how it will affect practice and to determine how bevacizumab is commonly used in the
community for MBC. METHODS: E-mails were sent out between September and November 2010 using a database of
3000 addresses maintained by the United Arab Emirates Cancer Congress. Individuals working for Roche or
Genentech were excluded. The survey consisted of 22 questions that were divided into 3 parts addressing each
participant’s demographic profile, their opinion of the FDA’s decision, and the typical use of bevacizumab in the community in the setting of MBC. RESULTS: A total of 564 participants were included in the final analysis, contributing to
an 18.8% response rate. Of these participants, 14.6% were from the United States, 7.8% were from Canada, 31.1% were
from Europe, 2.0% were from the United Arab Emirates, 11.1% were from Asia, and 33.3% were from other countries.
The majority of participants believed progression-free survival to be a surrogate for overall survival, that cost played
a role in the FDA’s decision, and that the decision would adversely affect the future of newer drugs currently being
investigated for MBC. The majority of participants indicated that they would use bevacizumab for triple receptor–
negative MBC (46.5%), would use it in a first-line setting (44.7%), and would use it in combination with paclitaxel
(51.9%). CONCLUSION: Our survey results highlight the discord between the opinion of community oncologists and

INTRODUCTION
In 2010, 207,090 women in the United States were estimated to be diagnosed with breast cancer, with approximately
39,840 deaths attributed to this disease.1 Among women diagnosed with primary breast cancer, 20%-50% develop metastatic
disease (MBC) that will be associated with an estimated 5-year survival of 26%.2 Through a combination of efficacious chemotherapeutic agents and aggressive support care services, the survival of women with MBC has improved over the decades.
In a retrospective analysis of women with recurrent breast cancer treated between 1974 and 2000, Giordano et al3 demonstrated a steady and impressive increase in median survival from 15 months among women diagnosed between 1974 and
1979 to almost 58 months among women diagnosed between 1995 and 2000. Perhaps the greatest stride made in the management of MBC was the introduction of trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against HER2-overexpressing tumors.4 In a pivotal trial that led to the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) 1998 approval of

trastuzumab, Slamon et al5 demonstrated a 20% reduction
in the risk of death when trastuzumab was added to chemotherapy as a first-line treatment among women with
HER2-overexpressing MBC.
Since the introduction of trastuzumab, research has
focused on improving outcomes of women with HER2negative MBC specifically focusing on the triple receptor–
negative breast cancer cohort (TNBC), a subgroup that is
known to be associated with a poor prognostic outcome.6
Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that
inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor, a key mediator
of angiogenesis and thus tumor growth, has been actively
investigated among women with HER2-negative MBC.7,8
Three randomized phase 3 clinical trials have evaluated the
addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy.9-11 The Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group E2100 trial demonstrated a
statistically significant improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.9 months when bevacizumab
was added to paclitaxel.9 The results of this trial were
reported 5 years ago and led the FDA to give a conditional accelerated approval of the drug in 2008 for use as a
first-line treatment in women with HER2-negative MBC.
The AVADO (Avastin and Docetaxel) and RIBBON-1
(Regimens in Bevacizumab for Breast Oncology)10,11 trials
were designed to not only validate the findings of the
E2100 trial but to also look at other bevacizumab-chemotherapy combinations. Although the results of the AVADO
and RIBBON trials demonstrated a statistically significant
PFS with the addition of bevacizumab, the results were less
striking than that demonstrated by the E2100 trial, with an
improvement in median PFS of 1.9 months observed in the
AVADO trial and 1.2-2.9 months depending on the chemotherapeutic agent used in the RIBBON-1 trial.10,11
With the additional data of the AVADO and RIBBON-1 trial available, the FDA convened in July 2010 to
re-evaluate the approval of bevacizumab for the treatment
of MBC, with the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee
(ODAC) recommending almost unanimously to remove
the indication from the product’s label.12 In December
2010, the FDA reconvened to finalize its decision and
made the announcement that it would begin withdrawing
the indication of bevacizumab for breast cancer.13 This
was met with a media frenzy that resulted in widespread
speculation of the implications of the FDA’s decision on
the treatment of women with HER2-negative MBC.
From speculation about cost as a factor in the decision
process, to inappropriate evaluation and interpretation of
clinical trial end points, to how physicians and patients
will react to this decision, the media has continued to fuel

Cancer

the debate and controversy surrounding this decision. On
the heels of this controversy, which has affected practice
not only in the United States but also across the globe, we
conducted a survey to determine the perception of health
care workers involved in the management of women with
MBC regarding the FDA’s decision to ascertain how it
will affect practice and to determine how bevacizumab is
commonly used in the community for MBC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The survey questionnaire was designed to be completed in
approximately 10 minutes. The survey consisted of 22
questions that were divided into 3 parts. The first part ascertained the demographic profile of the survey participants.
The second part comprised questions regarding the survey
participants’ opinion of the FDA’s current decision to possibly permanently withdraw approval of the use of bevacizumab for women with MBC (as was the situation at the time
the survey was sent out) and its associated causes and implications. The third part was restricted to physicians involved
in the management of women with breast cancer to determine how bevacizumab is typically used in the community
in the setting of MBC. Before proceeding to the third part
of the questionnaire, participants were asked whether they
treat breast cancer patients. If the answer was ‘‘no,’’ they
were asked to exit the survey at that point. The questions
used in the survey were derived from a literature review of
the ongoing controversy as well as frequently debated issues
surrounding bevacizumab that were presented at meetings
attended. Before the survey was sent out, it was piloted on a
group of 8 general medical oncologists of diverse ethnic origin working in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and was
modified according to feedback.
E-mails were then sent out using a database maintained by the UAE Cancer Congress. The database is
composed of 3000 e-mail addresses of medical and surgical oncologists as well as other health care professionals
involved in the oncology field. E-mail alerts for participation were sent out between September and November
2010. Participants were allowed to answer the survey only
once. No incentives were offered for answering the survey.
Of note, our database could not identify individuals
based on subspecialization, thus we could not restrict our
e-mails to medical oncologists only. Individuals working
for Roche or Genentech were excluded.
All data were extracted and maintained in an Excel
spreadsheet and are summarized using descriptive statistics. We conducted an e-mail survey that was reviewed
and approved by our institutional review board.

RESULTS
Demographics of Survey Participants
After excluding participants working for Roche and Genentech, 564 participants were included in the final analysis
contributing to an 18.8% response rate. Table 1 summarizes the demographic profile of the survey participants.
The majority of participants were aged 35-45 years
(34.8%), were men (70%), were medical oncologists
(77.6%), and were in practice for more than 10 years
(65.2%). Survey participants originated from across the
globe, with 14.6% from the United States, 7.8% from
Canada, 31.1% from Europe, 2.0% from the UAE,
11.1% from Asia, and 33.3% from other countries.
Opinion and Affect of Current FDA Decision
Figure 1 shows the survey participants’ perception of possible reasons behind the FDA’s decision to withdraw its
approval of bevacizumab for use among women with
MBC. Forty-eight percent of participants believed that
although the PFS benefits demonstrated in the AVADO

Figure 1. Graph illustrates survey participants’ perceptions of
the reasons behind and potential affect of the US Food and
Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) decision on bevacizumab approval. (Note that some of the following questions have been
shortened.) Question 1: The FDA are currently considering
withdrawal of approval for bevacizumab in the management
of metastatic breast cancer, as progression-free survival benefit shown by AVADO and RIBBON trials were not of the
same degree shown by the E2100 study. Do you think this is
a valid reason? Question 2: Do you think that the cost of bevacizumab has played a role in the FDA’s panel decision to
consider withdrawal of approval? Question 3: If the FDA
takes the step of withdrawal of approval of bevacizumab for
use in metastatic breast cancer, will this impact the current
trials evaluating its use in the adjuvant setting? Question 4:
Do you think that withdrawal of approval will open the door
for revision of other drugs that have attained approval?
Question 5: Do you think yet to be approved oncology drugs
will be adversely impacted as a result of this decision?

and RIBBON trials were not of the same degree observed
in the E2100 trial, this is a not a valid reason for the FDA to
consider withdrawal of approval, whereas 78% of participants believed that cost played a role in the FDA’s decision.
If the withdrawal of bevacizumab is sanctioned, the majority of participants believed that it would affect current trials
evaluating bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting (66%),
might result in other approved drugs being re-evaluated for
approval (79%), and would adversely affect the future of
drugs that are awaiting approval (45%).
One of the major points of controversy is whether
PFS is a good surrogate for overall survival (OS) in clinical
trials for MBC. When this question was posed to the participants, 57.3% responded that it is a good surrogate for
OS, 34% did not think it to be a good surrogate for OS,
and 8.6% did not know (Figure 2).

indication (Figure 3). Table 2 summarizes how participants involved in the treatment of MBC would use bevacizumab. The majority of participants found the drug to
be useful but not cost effective (36.3%), would use it specifically for triple receptor–negative breast MBC (46.5%),
would use it in a first-line setting (44.7%), and would use
it in combination with taxol (51.9%).

DISCUSSION
The goal of this international survey was to gauge the perception of health care professionals dealing with women
who have MBC regarding the current controversy surrounding the FDA’s decision to rescind its approval of
bevacizumab for the treatment of MBC. The results of
this survey indicate that 48% of community professionals
believed that the reason behind the FDA’s decision may
not be a valid one. The majority of participants believed
that cost probably played a role in the decision, and that
the FDA’s decision would surely adversely affect the
future of newer drugs currently being investigated for
MBC.
Taking a step back: Why did the FDA make such a
decision? When the results of the E2100 trial were
reported, the approval of bevacizumab for MBC was initially rejected, with a 5 to 4 vote against in 2007 by the
ODAC, which cited the trial’s open-label design (and
hence lack of placebo) and voiced concerns about the lack
of overall survival benefit. After an independent thirdparty review of E2100 radiographs proved that the addition of bevacizumab to weekly paclitaxel reduced the risk
of progression by half and doubled the overall response
rates, practically replicating the results initially reported
by the E2100 group, the FDA finally granted a condiCancer

using it in an off-label indication?’’ Answer 1: I do not use this
drug for women with MBC. Answer 2: I will be reluctant to
use it. Answer 3: I will use it in special circumstances. Answer

tional accelerated approval in February 2008.14 The approval was conditional on confirmatory trials, namely
AVADO and RIBBON-1. Although both trials met their
prespecified primary endpoint of statistically significant
improvement in PFS with the addition of bevacizumab to
chemotherapy, the improvements were not as dramatic as
those observed in the E2100 trial. In addition, all 3 trials
notably did not demonstrate an OS benefit. Demonstrating an OS benefit would indeed be difficult, given that it
was not a prespecified primary endpoint in any of the trials, and therefore there may not have been statistical
power to demonstrate a survival benefit. Furthermore, in
a period during which women with MBC received on average 3-6 lines of treatment, the confounding effects of
subsequent lines of treatment can account for the lack of
OS benefit seen. Taking all the additional information
into account the FDA on December 2010, after an overwhelming vote by ODAC of 12-1 against bevacizumab,
decided to begin the process of removing bevacizumab as
an indication for HER2-negative MBC, stating that the
decision was taken ‘‘solely on the scientific risk/benefit
analysis’’ and that ‘‘cost and reimbursement were not
taken into account.’’13 Interestingly, according to the
results of our survey, an impressive 78% of participants
felt that cost probably played a role in the decision-making process by the members of the FDA review panel. The
cost of bevacizumab is approximately $50,000 per year in
the United States, probably being much higher when taking into account ancillary administrative and associated

chemotherapy costs.15 Despite this fact the FDA review
process is in fact independent of economic variables.
The question that now presents itself is whether we
should ignore the results of the E2100 study? The international regulatory bodies and oncology community are certainly split on this issue. The FDA’s answer to the
question is clear. On the other hand, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for breast cancer
have incorporated the combination of paclitaxel and bevacizumab as one of the ‘‘preferred regimens for recurrent or
metastatic breast cancer.’’16 The European Medicines
Agency has recently backed the combination of paclitaxel
and bevacizumab, stating that ‘‘the benefit/risk balance
for this combination remains positive.’’17 On the other
hand, the National institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence in the United Kingdom noted that although

2784

the addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel improved PFS,
it did not improve OS, and taking into account the regimen’s cost estimate per quality adjusted life year in the
United Kingdom (£110,000-£259,000), it is not a ‘‘cost
effective use of the NHS resources.’’18 Certainly, the
results of the AVADO and RIBBON-1 trials do not refute
the results reported by the E2100 trial; however, the magnitude of benefit observed in the AVADO and RIBBON1 trials was not as great as that observed in the E2100 trial.
The investigators of the single-arm, open-label ATHENA
(Avastin Therapy for Advanced Breast Cancer) trial that
was designed to specifically look at the efficacy and safety
of the addition of bevacizumab in a broader-based community practice reported response rates of 52% and a median time to progression of 9.5 months, results that are
similar to those reported in the phase 3 randomized trials.

Cancer

Survey of Bevacizumab Ongoing Controversy/Dawood et al

However, all 3 randomized trials and the ATHENA trial
perhaps give us an indication that the chemotherapy backbone to which bevacizumab should be added needs to be
carefully selected, and as of now the best combination
appears to be the weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab combination. In our study, 51.9% of the survey participants
used bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel in their
community practice.
Is there a subgroup of women with MBC that would
most benefit from the addition of bevacizumab? In all 3
randomized studies (E2100, AVADO, RIBBON-1), the
time to treatment progression was similar among women
with TNBC and those with hormone receptor–positive
disease. With the typically poor prognostic outcome of
women with TNBC,6 research is currently focused on
identifying agents likely to improve outcome in this subgroup of women with MBC. In the absence of any targeted agent that preferentially benefits women with
TNBC, bevacizumab is often considered in this subgroup
and indeed in our survey the majority of participants
(46.5%) used bevacizumab in women with TNBC.
How concerned should we be about the safety profile of bevacizumab? In a recent meta-analysis, Choueiri
et al19 looked at the risk of congestive heart failure among
women with breast cancer receiving bevacizumab. The
authors reported an increased risk of congestive heart failure ranging from 1% to 2% with addition of bevacizumab
compared with chemotherapy alone. In a meta-analysis
conducted by Ranpural et al,20 the investigators looked at
the role of bevacizumab in treatment-related mortality
and reported that the most common causes of fatal related
adverse events were hemorrhage (23.5%), neutropenia
(12.2%), and gastrointestinal tract perforation (7.1%).
Although the results do not necessarily serve to discourage
the use of bevacizumab, nor do they diminish its efficacy,
they indicate that like any other agent used in the treatment of cancer, the drug should be respected and used
with caution, and that algorithms designed to prevent and
treat potential adverse effects should be developed and
incorporated into clinical practice.
In conclusion, it is unlikely that the debate over the
FDA’s decision to withdraw the approval of bevacizumab
as an indication for MBC will end any time soon. Several
issues highlight the cause of the controversy. First, different regulatory bodies have interpreted the results present
differently with the result that different approvals are now
in place across the globe. One would assume that when
analyzing risk and benefit, the interpretation would be the
same regardless of geographical location. Second, a major

Cancer

June 1, 2012

emphasis has been placed on the adverse effect profile of
bevacizumab. Although an important concern, the decision to use or not use bevacizumab would presumably be
made after a thorough discussion between physician and
patient such that an informed decision can be made.
Third, the initial accelerated approval by the FDA was a
provisional one pending results of the AVADO and
RIBBON-1 trials. Although the results were not as striking as the E2100 trial, the 2 subsequent trials met their
primary endpoint of a statistically significant PFS effect.
However, it remains that an overall survival benefit was
not observed. Fourth, the controversy as to whether PFS
is a good surrogate for overall survival among women with
MBC is still ongoing. In a recent review of phase 3 trials
for MBC Verma et al21 reported that among 37 trials conducted in the last 15 years, the FDA approved 12 new systemic therapies, of which 9 were approved based on nonOS outcome thereby highlighting the discord in the FDA
drug approval process. Regardless, as an oncology community, we eagerly await the decision of the current
appeal process for the FDA decision, which will have
implications far beyond that of bevacizumab in breast
cancer. Should the FDA reject the appeal application, our
survey indicates that a good proportion of communitybased oncologists will continue to use bevacizumab in an
off-label indication.
