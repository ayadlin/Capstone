Abstract
The ligand-activated nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor
(PXR) is known to play a role in the regulated expression of
drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Recent studies
suggest a potential clinically relevant role of PXR in breast
cancer. However, the relevant pathway or target genes of PXR
in breast cancer biology and progression have not yet been
fully clarified. In this study, we show that mRNA expression
of organic anion transporter polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2),
a transporter capable of mediating the cellular uptake of
estrogen metabolites, is nearly 10-fold greater in breast cancer
compared with adjacent healthy breast tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed exclusive expression of OATP1A2 in
breast cancer tissue. Interestingly, treatment of breast cancer
cells in vitro with the PXR agonist rifampin induced OATP1A2
expression in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent
manner. Consistent with its role as a hormone uptake
transporter, induction of OATP1A2 was associated with
increased uptake of estrone 3-sulfate. The rifampin response
was abrogated after small interfering RNA targeting of PXR.
We then identified a PXR response element in the human
OATP1A2 promoter, located f5.7 kb upstream of the
transcription initiation site. The specificity of PXR-OATP1A2
promoter interaction was confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Importantly, we used a novel potent and
specific antagonist of PXR (A-792611) to show the reversal of
the rifampin effect on the cellular uptake of E1S. These data
provide important new insights into the interplay between a
xenobiotic nuclear receptor PXR and OATP1A2 that could
contribute to the pathogenesis of breast cancer and may also
prove to be heretofore unrecognized targets for breast cancer
treatment. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9338–47]

Introduction
The pregnane X receptor (PXR; SXR, NR1I2) is a member of the
nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors.
This intracellular receptor has been shown to function as a
xenobiotic sensor importantly involved in drug metabolism and
transport. Indeed, this nuclear receptor is a major regulator of
cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9,

and CYP2B6 (1–5), and drug efflux transporters, such as multidrug
resistance protein 1 (MDR1; ABCB1) and multidrug resistanceassociated protein 2 (MRP2; ABCC2; refs. 6–8). The mechanistic
basis of many drug-drug interactions in vivo can now be explained
by the activation of this nuclear receptor and the resultant
induction of hepatic and intestinal enzymes and transporters. Not
surprisingly, PXR expression has been noted in several tissues
which are exposed to high levels of xenobiotics, such as the liver,
intestine, lung, and kidney (9, 10). Interestingly, PXR expression has
also been detected in normal and neoplastic human breast tissue
(11). Recently, a study by Miki and colleagues noted expression of
PXR and the drug uptake transporter organic anion transporter
polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2) in human breast cancer tissue.
Importantly, OATP1A2 and PXR expression was proposed as a
histopathologic marker of dedifferentiation and progression of
breast cancer (12).
OATP1A2 is a member of the OATP superfamily of transporters
that mediate the cellular uptake of endobiotics and xenobiotics.
OATP1A2 has been shown to be expressed in hepatic cholangiocytes, the capillary endothelia forming the blood-brain barrier (13),
and the apical domain of intestinal enterocytes (14). OATP1A2
expression in normal nonmalignant breast tissue has been noted to
be very low especially compared with other members of the OATP
family, such as OATP-B (OATP2B1), OATP-E (OATP4A1), and
OATP-D (OATP3A1), although OATP1A2 expression in lactating
mammary epithelium cells (MEC) is significantly greater compared
with nonlactating MECs, suggesting regulated physiologic function
of this transporter in breast tissue (15, 16).
Of potential significance to breast cancer, OATP1A2 is known to
mediate the cellular uptake of hormone conjugates (17). Despite
the known ability of this transporter to mediate the cellular uptake
of biologically active hormone conjugates, such as estrone 3-sulfate
(E1S) and estradiol 17h-glucuronide, the possible role of regulated
OATP1A2 expression to hormone-associated progression of breast
cancer has not yet been clarified. It should be noted that exposure
of breast cancer cells to E1S has been shown in vitro to result
in increased cellular proliferation and that this effect could be
modulated by concomitant treatment with bromosulfophthalein, a
known nonspecific OATP inhibitor (18, 19). However, an association of such effect to the uptake transporter OATP1A2 had not
been reported. Note that E1S level is significantly greater in
malignant tissue, resulting in increased levels of biologically active
17h-estradiol (20). Mechanistically, it is plausible that OATP1A2
plays a pivotal role in regulating proliferation and tumor
promotion of breast tissue by enhancing the uptake of estradiol
metabolites, thereby increasing intracellular levels of such hormones that activate the estrogen receptor. Importantly, molecular

mechanisms that determine OATP1A2 overexpression in breast
cancer have not been defined.
In this study, we examined OATP1A2 and PXR expression in
neoplastic and adjacent nonneoplastic breast tissue. In addition,
expression of OATP1A2 and PXR was assessed in a panel of breast
cancer tissues of different tumor stages. To assess whether a direct
link between PXR activation and human OATP1A2 expression
exists, cell-based reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed to identify a PXR response element
in the OATP1A2 gene. In addition, using a breast cancer cell model,
we were able to show OATP1A2 induction results in greater E1S
cellular uptake and enhanced estrogen receptor activation.
Importantly, using a newly identified specific and potent PXR
antagonist, we showed that inhibition of PXR activity attenuates
the proliferative effects of estrogen.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Rifampin, tamoxifen, E1S, and p-nitrophenolphosphate were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Tritium-labeled E1S was obtained from
Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences. The PXR inhibitor A-792611 was provided by
Dr. J. Waring and D. Kempf (Abbott Labs).
Cell culture. MCF-7, T47-D, HeLa, and HepG2 cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection. MCF-7 cells were grown in EMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), nonessential amino acids,
L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. T47-D and HepG2 were maintained in RPMI and DMEM, respectively. Media and supplements were
purchased from Cambrex. Cell culture was performed at 37jC with 5% CO2
in a humidified atmosphere.
Tissue samples. Malignant and adjacent nonmalignant breast tissue
samples were obtained from Vanderbilt Tissue Procurement Core. Paraffinembedded tissue slides were prepared by the Department of Pathology at
Vanderbilt University. Tissue for RNA isolation was snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at 80jC. In addition, a commercially available
TissueScan Real-Time Breast Cancer Disease Panel (Origene) of breast
cancer tissue of different stages was used for quantification of gene
expression.
RNA isolation from tissue samples and cultured cells. For RNA
extraction, the QiaMINI RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was used. Frozen breast tissue
was mechanically homogenized in RLT buffer supplemented with
h-mercaptoethanol. Subsequently, the thawed homogenate was centrifuged
through a QiaShredder column and the eluate was loaded on purification
columns. The following RNA isolation was performed, as described by
the manufacturer. Briefly, phenol-chloroform extraction was performed
to isolate RNA from in vitro experiments using Trizol (Invitrogen). The
integrity and content of the RNA were determined using the Agilent
Bioanalyzer (Agilent). RNA samples were stored at 80jC.
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was reverse transcribed in a 50-AL reaction
volume containing 1,500 ng of RNA with the TaqMan Reverse Transcription
kit (Applied Biosystems) using random hexamers, as described by the
manufacturer. The amount of OATP1A2, PXR, CAR, and 18S were measured
by SYBRgreen quantitative real-time PCR with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence
detection system (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of primers used for
establishing the amount of the transporter, the nuclear receptors and the
endogenous control were as follows: OATP1A2 for 5¶-AAGACCAACGCAGGATCCAT-3¶, OATP1A2 rev 5¶-GAGTTTCACCCATTCCACGTACA-3¶; PXR
for 5¶-CAGCGGAAGAAAAGTGAAC-3¶, PXR rev 5¶-CACAGATCTTTCCGGACCTG-3¶; 18S for 5¶-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCATT-3’; 18S rev 5¶-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3¶; and CAR for 5¶-CCAGCTCATCTGTTCATCCA-3¶,
CAR rev 5¶-GGTAACTCCAGGTCGGTCAG-3¶. The quantitative PCR was
carried out in 25 AL reaction volume containing 300 nmol/L of each primer,
1  SYBRgreen PCR Master Mix, and 40 ng of the reverse transcribed cDNA.
The amount of the transporter and the nuclear receptor were normalized
to 18S-rRNA.
Immunofluorescence. Protein localization of OATP1A2 in human
breast neoplastic and normal tissue was investigated by immunofluores-

cence microscopy. For OATP1A2 detection, a polyclonal antibody raised in
rabbit was used (13). Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were prepared
by standard methods. The tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylol.
Afterwards the tissue sections were incubated in ethanol of declining
concentration from 100% to 50% for rehydratation and then rinsed in
distilled water. For heat-induced epitope retrieval, the tissue sections were
boiled in citrate buffer (10 mmol/L, pH 6.0). After washing twice in ice-cold
PBS, the slides were blocked with 5% FBS-PBS. Thereafter, the slides were
incubated with diluted anti–OATP1A2 antibody (1:50) in a humidified
atmosphere at 4jC overnight. After several washing steps with PBS, the
sections were incubated with the fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody
(Invitrogen). After washing the slides with PBS, the tissue was mounted
in antifading mounting medium containing 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Vector Laboratories). Images were obtained by fluorescence
microscopy. As negative control, the primary antibody was omitted.
Western blot analysis. To determine the effect on OATP1A2 protein
expression, T47-D cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes. After treatment for
24 h, the cells were harvested in 5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). After freezeshock in liquid nitrogen, the cell suspension was homogenized using a
Dounce Potter. Membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at
100,000  g at 4jC, and 50 Ag of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and
electrotransferred to NuPAGE nitrocellulose membrane Western blotting
system (Invitrogen). OATP1A2 in HeLa cells overexpressed using a vtf7
virus, as previously described, was used as positive control (13). Total cell
lysate (15 Ag) of transfected cells was used. To enhance utility of the
OATP1A2-antibody described above (1:1,000), for Western blot analysis,
the antibody was further purified using the Melon Gel IgG purification kit
(Thermo-Fisher). A horseradish peroxidase–labeled antirabbit antibody
(1:2,000; Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary. The immobilized secondary
antibody was detected using the ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection
System (GE Healthcare) and KODAK ImageStation 4000 MM (Mandel).
To normalize sample loading, the blot was reprobed with a monoclonal
antiactin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich).
In silico scan for PXR response elements. A 10-kb fragment upstream
of the transcription start of the OATP1A2 gene was screened for potential
PXR binding sites using the NUBIscan algorithm.4
Plasmids. CYP3A4-XREM-Luc plasmid containing the proximal promoter
( 362/+53) and distal XREM ( 7836/ 7208) inserted in pGL3 basic
(Promega) was used as positive control for PXR response (21). OATP1A2
regulatory regions containing the basal promoter ( 440/+50) and distal
fragments that contained putative PXR response elements (PXRRE), namely
the 1130 to 1960, the 4400 to 3100, the 6600 to 5750, and the
6600 to 5120 segments of the SLCO1A2 gene, were prepared by PCR
using the following primers: 450-OATP1A2 for 5¶-GGGTGTGCGCTCGAGGTCTTACATCTTAGTTTG-’3, +50-OATP1A2 rev 5¶-GGGTGTGCGAGATCTAGAAAATCATGGTGTTAG-’3, 1960-OATP1A2 for 5¶-GGGTGTGCGCCCGGGACTGTGTGGTCCTGGGAG-’3, 1130-OATP1A2 rev 5¶-GGGTGTGCGCTCGAGTAGAAGGAAATGCAATTT-’3, 4400-OATP1A2 for 5¶ GGGTGTGCGACGCGTACTAGCTATCATCATCAC-’3, 3100-OATP1A2 rev

5750-OATP1A2 rev 5¶-GGGTGTGCGACGCGTCAATACTTGTCTGTCTCG’3. The distal fragments of the SLCO1A2 gene were subcloned into pGL3basic, immediately upstream of the basal promoter. MutOATP1A2-5120-Luc
plasmids, containing mutated PXR (DR4, DR3) response elements, were
prepared by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Stratagene).
PXR reporter gene assays. T47-D or HepG2 cells were plated in 24-well
plates. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 250 ng of the reporter vector
(pGL3 basic variants), 25 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega) to normalize
transfection efficiency, and 250 ng of human PXR expression plasmid
(pEF-hPXR) or vector control in 200 AL Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) using
Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated for 16 h with the transfection

mixture and then treated for 24 h with the tested agents. The reporter
enzyme activities were assayed with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system,
as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Luminescence was quantified
using a plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Thermo-Fisher). Luciferase
activities in the presence of transfected PXR were expressed as a percentage
of cells transfected with blank vector.
Estrogen receptor reporter gene assays. T47-D cells were plated in
24 wells in RPMI supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS. After 24 h,
cells were transfected with 250 ng of a commercially available vector
containing a secreted alkaline phosphatase gene, whose expression is
controlled by an estrogen responsive element (ERE; Clontech). After
pretreatment with rifampin or DMSO in RPMI without phenol red
supplemented with L-glutamine and 1% charcoal-stripped FBS (Invitrogen),
the cells were exposed to E1S (10 nmol/L). After treatment, activity of
alkaline phosphatase was determined by combining 30 AL of the sample
with 150 AL of 5 mmol/L p-nitrophenolphosphate prepared in 80 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 9.6) for 60 min at 37jC. The reaction was stopped by
the addition of 20 AL 0.1 mol/L NaOH. The amount of reduced
p-nitrophenolphosphate was determined by UV spectroscopy at 405 nm
using a plate reader (Multiskan Spectrum, Thermo-Fisher).
Cellular modulation of PXR expression with small interfering RNA.
T47-D cells were suspended to a final concentration of 1  105 cells/mL in
growth medium and incubated at 37jC. The lipid-based transfection agent
siPort NeoFX (Ambion) was used for transfection of PXR small interfering
RNA (siRNA; Ambion), as described by the manufacturer. The transfection
was incubated for 12 h at 37jC at 5% CO2. Afterwards, cells were treated
with rifampin (1 Amol/L) or DMSO for 24 h.

E1S uptake experiments. T47-D cells were grown in 12 wells and
pretreated with rifampin or DMSO. Cells were incubated with tritiumlabeled E1S (1 Amol/L, containing 400,000 dpm/well). After 10 min of
incubation at 37jC, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold Opti-MEM
and lysed using 1% SDS. The cellular uptake of E1S was determined using
Ultima Gold scintillation liquid and a liquid scintillation counter (Tri-Carb
2900TR, Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences).
AlamarBlue cell proliferation assay. T47-D or MCF-7 cells were
pretreated with rifampin or DMSO and then exposed to E1S. To determine
cell viability and proliferation, the AlamarBlue assay reagent (Biosource)
was used, as described by the manufacturer. The production of the reduced
product was monitored spectrophotometrically at 570 and 600 nm.
ChIP assay. For DNA cross-linking and ChIP, the EZ ChIP Assay
(Millipore) was used, as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, T47D cells
were cultured in 10-cm dishes and treated for 48 h with DMSO or rifampin
(1 Amol/L). After DNA cross-linking, the cells were lysed. DNA was then
sheared by sonication (Virsonic 100, Virtis). The shearing efficacy was
analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure that the average size of
DNA was 1,500 kb. Thereafter, the sheared and cross-linked chromatin was
incubated with 5 Ag of each antibody overnight at 4jC. Two polyclonal
anti-PXR sera were used (A-20 and N-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). An
anti–acetyl-histone (H3) antibody was used as control.
The antibody-antigen-chromatin complex was gathered with protein G
agarose and centrifugation. After several washing steps, the antibodychromatin complex was eluted and bound DNA was released by incubation
at 65jC overnight after adding 8 AL of 5 mol/L NaCl, treated with RNase A
and proteinase K, and purified. Binding of human PXR to the SLCO1A2 gene

was confirmed by PCR amplification of a 210-bp fragment of genomic DNA
encompassing the putative PXR (DR4-1) binding site. The following primers
were used in the PCR: ChIP for 5¶-CCACCTTTCTTTCTCCATCTT-3¶, ChIP
rev 5¶-TCTAATTTAAGCCACATTTC-3¶. PCR was carried out in 50 AL volume
using the AmpliTaqGold PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The annealing
temperature was 54jC, followed by elongation at 72jC for 30 s. The PCR
was performed at 32 cycles. For the acetyl histone H3, the PCR was
performed, as described by the manufacturer, using the AmpliTaq Gold PCR
system. PCR products were separated on 4% agarose gels.
Statistical analysis. Determination of statistical differences between
group variables was determined using Student’s t test and Mann-Whitney
U test (GraphPad Software, Inc.). A P value of <0.05 was taken to be the
minimum level of statistical significance.

Results
OATP1A2 and PXR expression in malignant and normal
human breast tissue. OATP1A2 and PXR expression was
examined using real-time PCR. Both transcripts were detectible
in all malignant (n = 4) and nonneoplastic (n = 4) tissue samples.
Breast cancer tissue showed an 8-fold higher expression of
OATP1A2 compared with the adjacent normal tissue in all samples
tested (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the level of PXR expression was nearly
8-fold higher in malignant tissue compared with the adjacent
normal tissue of each subject (Fig. 1D). Immunofluorescence
microscopy revealed restricted expression of OATP1A2 in human
malignant breast tissue using a specific antibody against OATP1A2.
Distinct immunofluorescent signals were not observed in normal
human breast tissue and in tumor or normal tissue when the
primary antibody was omitted (Fig. 1B, C).
Detection of OATP1A2 mRNA in breast cancer tissue cDNA
panel. OATP1A2 expression was also assessed in a panel of
different stages of breast cancer by real-time PCR. The number of
OATP1A2 transcripts was greater in tumor stages I and IIA
compared with stage 0 (containing samples of patients with
carcinoma in situ or fibrocystic changes; OATP1A2 expression
relative to stage 0, mean F SD: stage 0, 1.23 F 0.898 n = 4; stage I,
3.03 F 3.37 n = 11; stage IIA, 5.10 F 3.95, n = 15; stage IIB, 1.07 F
0.28, n = 4; stage IIIA, 0.55 F 0.14, n = 4; stage IIIC, 0.88 F 0.41,
n = 2). It is noteworthy that OATP1A2 was undetectable in some
samples of higher stages. In three of seven samples of stage IIB,
in four of eight samples of stage IIIA, and in one of three samples
of stage IIIC, OATP1A2 expression did not reach the minimum level
of detection. The absence of OATP1A2 expression was not related
to estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or Her2 status
reported by the company. PXR-mRNA was detectible in all samples,
and the tumor stage–dependent expression pattern was similar to
OATP1A2 (PXR expression relative to stage 0, mean F SD: stage 0,
1.05 F 0.35 n = 4; stage I, 2.57 F 1.44 n = 11; stage IIA, 4.37 F 2.03
n = 15; stage IIB, 1.82 F 0.52 n = 7; stage IIIA, 1.88 F 2.35 n = 7;
stage IIIC, 3.29 F 1.53 n = 3).
PXR regulates OATP1A2 expression and estrogen-mediated
cell proliferation. To examine the interaction between PXR and
OATP1A2, T47-D breast cancer cells were treated with the known
PXR activator rifampin. Treatment of T47-D cells was associated
with a time-dependent induction of OATP1A2. Increased transporter mRNA levels were evident at 6 hours after initiation of
rifampin treatment and reached maximum levels at 8 hours.
OATP1A2 expression upon PXR activation was concentrationdependent (Fig. 2A). Another estrogen receptor–positive breast
cancer cell line (MCF-7 cells) was used to determine if PXR
expression levels differ compared with T47-D cells, resulting in
changes in rifampin response. We noted no difference in PXR

expression (relative PXR expression F SE: MCF-7 cells, 1.01 F 0.34;
T47-D cells, 1.09 F 0.57). However, the effect of rifampin on
OATP1A2 expression was more pronounced in T47-D cells after
treatment with rifampin for 8 hours (relative OATP1A2 expression
F SE: MCF-7 cells, 8.02 F 0.93; T47-D cells, 13.15 F 2.87).
One of the known effects of the OATP1A2 substrate, E1S, is
the enhancement of cell proliferation in vitro. Cell proliferation
was assessed after pretreatment of T47-D cells with rifampin
(1 Amol/L) or DMSO and subsequent exposure to E1S for 24 hours
(10 nmol/L) using AlamarBlue. As shown in Fig. 2B, T47-D cells
treated with the PXR activator exhibited a significantly higher
ability to metabolize the AlamarBlue reagent compared with cells
exposed to DMSO before the E1S treatment. Similar results were
obtained in MCF-7 cells (cell viability %-DMSO control, mean F SE:
pretreatment with DMSO followed by E1S, 120.31 F 6.38; pretreatment with rifampin followed by DMSO, 94.47 F 11.61; pretreatment
with rifampin followed by E1S, 155.9 F 25.46; data not shown).
Effect of PXR-siRNA and OATP1A2 mediated E1S uptake in
T47-D cells. siRNA-mediated cellular knockdown of PXR was used
to validate the involvement of PXR in regulating OATP1A2
expression and the resultant increase in cellular uptake of E1S.
In siRNA-treated T47-D cells, a marked reduction of PXR level
(Fig. 2C) was associated with the loss of rifampin-induced
OATP1A2 expression (Fig. 2C) and rifampin-stimulated E1S uptake.
Cells transfected with control siRNA and treated with rifampin
(10 Amol/L) exhibited a 1.5-fold induction of E1S uptake compared
with cells treated 24 hours with DMSO (E1S uptake %-DMSO
control, mean F SE: DMSO treated, 100.00 F 12.45; rifampin
treated, 157.18 F 10.73), whereas cells transfected with PXR-siRNA
and treated with rifampin do not exhibit an increase in E1S uptake
(E1S uptake %-DMSO control, mean F SE, DMSO treated, 99.99 F
3.59; rifampin treated, 108.06 F 3.31; Fig. 2D).
Identification of functional PXR response elements in the
SLCO1A2. We next aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms
involved in PXR-mediated regulated OATP1A2 expression. Hence,
a 10-kb fragment of the SLCO1A2 gene was scanned using the
NUBIscan algorithm (18) to reveal potential PXRRE. Included in
the search were known PXR responsive DNA motifs of tandem
hexameric repeats with various spacing and orientation, such as
DR4, DR3, ER6, and ER8. To confirm whether the predicted binding
sites were functional, fragments of the SLCO1A2 gene containing
potential PXRREs were subcloned into a luciferase vector
containing a basal promoter fragment of SLCO1A2 ( 440 to
+50 bp) and assessed in cell-based reporter gene assays.
The promoter constructs were tested by cotransfecting PXR
into T47-D cells. Addition of the known PXR activator rifampin
(10 Amol/L) resulted in PXR-dependent enhanced luciferase
activation of the construct containing the 5120 to 6600 bp
fragment of the SLCO1A2 gene. Rifampin-stimulated, PXR-dependent reporter activity was not observed in other fused reporter
constructs tested (Fig. 3A). However, a slight, but statistically
significant, activation of the basal promoter construct was seen in
rifampin-treated cells. These results are in agreement with previous
findings testing the PXR-dependent activation of CYP3A4, showing
that activation of the basal promoter is significantly increased by
a distal enhancer module containing the actual PXRRE of CYP3A4
(22, 23). We observed similar findings performing the experiment
using hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells or using the PXR
activator tamoxifen (10 Amol/L; data not shown).
Because another reporter construct containing overlapping
sequences from 5790 to 6600 bp was unresponsive to PXR

activation, we focused on possible PXRREs located between 5120
and 5790. Within this region, NUBIscan analysis exposed five
potential PXR binding sites (Fig. 3, insert). These putative PXRREs
were systematically mutated using a site-directed mutagenesis
approach and tested in reporter assays. Interestingly, mutation of
the DR4-1 DNA motif (localized at 5786 to 5801) resulted in the
complete loss of rifampin-stimulated, PXR-dependent, luciferase
reporter activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3B) and T47-D cells (data not
shown). These findings suggest that this DR4 element in the
SLCO1A2 promoter is transactivated by agonist-bound PXR.
ChIP using anti-PXR antibodies. To further confirm the role of
the DR4-1 element in the inductive regulation of OATP1A2
expression, we used antibody-mediated immunoprecipitation of
PXR bound to chromatin. T47-D cells were treated with rifampin
(1 Amol/L) or DMSO, and ChIP analysis was performed on
formaldehyde cross-linked DNA with subsequent immunoprecipitation with two different PXR antibodies (A-20 and N-16). PCR
amplification of a 210-bp fragment of the OATP1A2 gene
surrounding the putative DR4-1 PXRRE from immunoprecipitated
DNA revealed specific signals in cells treated with rifampin, but not
in vehicle-treated cells using both antibodies (Fig. 3C). These
results show that rifampin-activated PXR binds to the OATP1A2
promoter and strongly suggest that the DR4-1 motif is a key
element responsible for OATP1A2 transactivation by PXR.
Pharmacologic modulation of OATP1A2 expression and
function by PXR antagonism. Recently, we have identified a novel
potent and selective PXR antagonist A-792611 (24). As expected,
addition of A-792611 abolished the PXR activation of the OATP1A2
reporter construct (Fig. 4A). Importantly, the inductive effect of
rifampin on OATP1A2 expression could be abolished by treatment
of T47-D cells with A-792611 (Fig. 4B). Similar results were
obtained when OATP1A2 expression was assessed using Western
blot analysis. T47-D cells treated with rifampin exhibited
significantly higher OATP1A2 protein levels compared with those
cells treated with rifampin and A-792611 (Fig. 4C). Cotreatment
with A-792611 abolished the increased cellular accumulation of
E1S associated with rifampin treatment (Fig. 5A).
Stimulated estrogen receptor signaling with OATP1A2
induction is attenuated by PXR antagonism. To determine
whether OATP1A2-mediated E1S transport is associated with
increased estrogenic effects, estrogen receptor–positive T47-D cells
were transfected with an alkaline phosphatase reporter construct
driven by an ERE and then treated with rifampin. When the cells
were exposed to E1S and alkaline phosphatase activity was
determined, estrogen receptor activation was significantly higher

Figure 2. Association of PXR with OATP1A2 expression and activity in
T47-D cells. T47-D cells were treated with different concentrations of
rifampin for 8 h, and the OATP1A2 expression was determined showing a
concentration-dependent effect on transporter mRNA expression (A ). To assess
the effect of the transporter-associated uptake of E1S on the cell viability of
T47-D cells, those breast cancer cells were pretreated with rifampin 1 Amol/L for
24 h, respectively, and then exposed to E1S (10 nmol/L). After 24 h of incubation,
cell proliferation was determined using the AlamarBlue assay reagent (B ). T47-D
cells were transfected with siRNA PXR to validate the interplay between PXR
activation and OATP1A2 expression and function. The efficacy of the cellular
knockdown of PXR was assessed by real-time PCR in cells transfected with
siRNA-PXR (black ) or siRNA-negative control (white, C). The level of OATP1A2
and PXR mRNA expression in cells transfected with the PXR-siRNA was
determined by real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) after 8 h of
incubation with rifampin (1 Amol/L; C ). To assess the effect of the cellular
knockdown of PXR on the rifampin-modulated OATP1A2 function, cells were
transfected with the siRNA and treated with rifampin; subsequently, the cellular
accumulation of [3H]E1S was determined (D). Columns, mean; bars, SD (n = 3).

after pretreatment with the PXR activator rifampin. This increase
of rifampin-stimulated estrogen receptor activity could be reduced
by cotreatment with the PXR inhibitor A-792611 (Fig. 5B).
Determination of responsiveness of the OATP1A2 promoter
fragment to constitutive and activated CAR. To determine
whether the identified PXRRE (DR4-1) in the OATP1A2 promoter
fragment is activated by CAR, a nuclear receptor which shares the
same DNA motif as PXR (25), we performed a reporter gene assay
on the responsive OATP1A2 promoter element. In fact, expression
of CAR in HepG2 cells resulted in a significant induction of
luciferase activity, which increased with treatment of the known
CAR ligand, CITCO (10 Amol/L). This effect was not seen using the
OATP1A2 promoter fragment harboring the mutation in the DR4-1
motif (Fig. 5C).
Expression of CAR in nonmalignant and malignant breast
tissue. Assessing CAR mRNA expression by performing real-time
PCR in human breast cancer tissue revealed significantly higher
expression of CAR in nonmalignant compared with malignant
breast tissue (CAR expression relative to nonmalignant tissue,

mean F SD; nonmalignant tissue, 1.01 F 0.72 n = 4; malignant
tissue, 0.21 F 0.74 n = 4; t test, P < 0.05; data not shown). However,
in T47-D and MCF-7 cells, detection of CAR did not reach the
minimum level of detection, and this is in agreement with the
analysis of OATP1A2 expression in T47-D cells after 24 hours of
treatment with CITCO (1 Amol/L), which failed to result in the
induction of OATP1A2 expression (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
The mammary gland is widely recognized as an estrogen target
tissue. Estrogens are thought to act through the intracellular
estrogen receptors to direct normal lobular development, regulate
epithelial cell growth, and increase the expression of steroid
hormone metabolizing enzymes (26, 27). In addition to those
physiologic processes, the relationship between estrogens and the
development and progression of breast cancer has been widely
studied. Starting with the findings from George Beatson in 1896
reporting improved outcome from breast cancer in a postmenopausal woman after removal of her ovaries, subsequent studies

increased activity of luciferase in T47-D cells transfected with the 5120 to 6600 OATP1A2 promoter fragment after treatment with rifampin (10 Amol/L; A).
In silico analysis of the responsive fragment revealed several potential DNA motifs (insert ). Subsequent mutation of those motifs revealed a loss of transactivation
mediated by rifampin (B) in HepG2 transfected with a construct containing a mutated DR4 motif. To validate the link between OATP1A2 transactivation by PXR, a ChIP
was performed using different anti-PXR antibodies (A-20 and N-16 supplied by Santa Cruz). The PCR detecting a DNA fragment, which includes the identified
DR4 motif, suggests that this DNA motif is involved in the PXR-mediated induction of OATP1A2 (C ). Columns, mean; bars, SD (n = 3). *, P < 0.05, t test.

Figure 4. Inhibition of the PXR effects on OATP1A2, using a specific PXR inhibitor cell-based reporter gene assay in HepG2 cells using the reporter vector containing
the 5120 to 6600 fragment of the OATP1A2 gene, was performed to determine the ability of A-792611 (10 Amol/L) to inhibit the rifampin (10 Amol/L)–associated
PXR-mediated transactivation (A). T47-D cells were treated with rifampin (10 Amol/L) in the presence of different concentrations of A-792611 to determine the
modulation of OATP1A2 expression using real-time RT-PCR (B). Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of rifampin (1 Amol/L) in the presence
and absence of the PXR inhibitor A-792611 (1 Amol/L) on OATP1A2 expression in T47-D cells (C). Cell lysates of HeLa cells transfected with OATP1A2-pEF6 or

have established a clear link between estrogens and the
pathogenesis of breast cancer (28). Several studies have focused
on plasma levels of estradiol and breast cancer risk. However, such
studies have been inconsistent in linking breast cancer risk with
increased plasma levels of estradiol (29, 30). Interestingly,
endogenous E1S levels have been linked with a greater risk of
breast cancer (29). E1S is a major circulating estrogen metabolite
with a long half-live in humans (f9 hours), is found at high plasma
levels in women (280 pg/mL), and is thought to be one of the major
precursors of active estrogen in postmenopausal women (31).
Due to the hydrophilic nature of this compound, it is likely that an
uptake transporter is needed to facilitate the transmembrane entry
into tissues, such as breast.
In this report, we show a tumor-specific overexpression of the
uptake transporter OATP1A2 in breast tissue. Importantly, we show
a PXR-mediated induction of this transporter can markedly
enhance the extent of E1S uptake in breast cancer cells and
significantly increase estrogen receptor–mediated gene transcription. Regulation of gene expression by PXR has been studied for a
few Oatps/OATPs. For example, activation of Pxr in mouse causes
hepatic up-regulation of Oatp1a4 (Oatp2; ref. 32). In rats, Oatp2
(Oatp1a4) gene expression is induced by phenobarbital and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

pregnenolone-16a-carbonitrile, well-known activators of CAR and
PXR (33).
In breast tissues and breast cancer cell lines, including T47-D
and MCF-7 cells, E1S is efficiently converted to bioactive estrone
due to high steroid sulfatases (STS) activity (34, 35). Moreover,
in breast cancer, there is a compelling association of tumor size
and risk of recurrence with STS expression (36). In addition,
pharmacologic targeting of STS is considered to be one of the
potential strategies of breast cancer treatment. In fact, therapeutic
reduction of STS activity resulted in a significant reduction in
tumor growth when assessed using an animal model (37). Estrone
is assumed to be converted to highly biological active 17h-estradiol
by 17h-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD1). Expressed
level of this enzyme between nonmalignant and malignant tissue
revealed not to differ (38). However, recent findings suggest that
gene duplications of HSD1 may result in increased risk of breast
cancer recurrence among estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer
cases (39).
Of relevance to breast cancer biology, it has been shown that
estrone and 17h-estradiol are moderate but sufficient activators of
PXR (40, 41). In addition, several antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen,
are PXR activators. Our data, which show direct functional

OATP1A2 and PXR in Human Breast Cancer

interaction of PXR with promoter elements in SLCO1A2 would
suggest that a feed forward regulation of OATP1A2 by PXR likely
results in greater uptake of E1S. Accordingly, pharmacologic
inhibition of PXR activation may have potential therapeutic effects
by modulating breast cancer progression. Assuming that estrogen
metabolites, such as E1S, are important driving forces in the
development of breast cancer, the effect of uptake transporters in
governing the accumulation of this steroid precursor in estrogenic
target tissues should also be considered as an important pathophysiologic determinant. As shown in Fig. 6, the link between
PXR activation and E1S accumulation may be of clinical relevance
because estrone and 17h-estradiol are activators of PXR and,
therefore, are likely to increase their own cellular uptake in
responsive tissues.
It is of interest to note recent reports describing beneficial
effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in terms of breast cancer
risk (42–44). Efficacy of statins in breast cancer prevention is
assumed to be related to the pleiotropic effects, including
antiproliferative, proapoptotic, anti-invasive, and radiosensitizing

properties of statins (45). In fact, it has been shown that lipophilic
statins (simvastatin and fluvastatin) inhibit the growth of
mammary tumor cells inoculated in neuTg mice. This reduction
seemed to be due to statin-associated reduction in tumor
proliferation and increased apoptosis (46). It should be noted that
OATP1A2 not only transports E1S but also statins (47). Therefore,
one plausible mechanism for their apparent beneficial effect to
breast cancer proliferation might relate to reduced OATP1A2mediated E1S uptake due to competition for uptake by statins.
It should be noted that PXR has also been linked to
antiapoptotic effects in several cell types, including hepatocytes
and prostate cancer cells. Recently, constitutive and pharmacologic
activation of PXR was associated with antiapoptotic effects in
colon cancer cells. Specifically, PXR activation resulted in increased
expression of antiapoptotic genes, including BAG3, BIRC2, and
MCL-1, thereby counteracting the effects of proapoptotic compounds, such as deoxycholic acid, adriamycin, staurosporine, and
dimethylhydracine (48). Accordingly, if such an antiapoptotic effect
is extended to our findings in relation to breast cancer, higher

OATP1A2 interplay in breast cancer. The
interplay of PXR activation and, therefore,
modulation of OATP1A2 expression and
function in breast cancer cells is illustrated.
Induction of OATP1A2 is expected to result
in increased cellular uptake of hydrophilic
estrogen metabolites leading to the
increased estrogenic effects. This interplay

expression of PXR in neoplastic tissue would translate into a higher
proliferative activity due to PXR-mediated activation of antiapoptotic genes.
In summary, we have shown that OATP1A2 expression was
highly increased in malignant human breast cancer tissues.
Expression of the uptake transporter was associated with similarly
elevated expression of PXR in malignant tissue, suggesting an
interplay between the nuclear receptor PXR and OATP1A2. We
show direct transactivation of SLCO1A2 by PXR at a distal PXRRE
and reduced PXR expression via siRNA technology or PXR function
using a novel PXR antagonist significantly reduced the E1Sassociated estrogen receptor signaling in a breast cancer cell line.
In conclusion, the current finding suggests an important role of
the xenobiotic nuclear receptor PXR to the regulated expression of
