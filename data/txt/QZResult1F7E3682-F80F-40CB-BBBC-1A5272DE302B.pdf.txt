ABSTRACT
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a head and neck cancer prevalent throughout
Southern China and Southeast Asia. Patient death following relapse after primary
treatment remains all too common but the cause of NPC relapse is unclear. Clinical and
epidemiological studies have revealed the high correlation among NPC development,
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation and host genomic instability. Previously,
recurrent EBV reactivation was shown to cause massive genetic alterations and
enhancement of tumor progression in NPC cells and these may be required for NPC
relapse. Here, EBV BALF3 has the ability to induce micronuclei and DNA strand breaks.
After recurrent expression of BALF3 in NPC cells, genomic copy number aberrations,
determined by array-based comparative genomic hybridization, had accumulated to a
significant extent and tumorigenic features, such as cell migration, cell invasion and
spheroid formation, increased with the rounds of induction. In parallel experiments,
cells after highly recurrent induction developed into larger tumor nodules than control
cells when inoculated into NOD/SCID mice. Furthermore, RNA microarrays showed
that differential expression of multiple cancer capability-related genes and oncogenes
increased with recurrent BALF3 expression and these changes correlated with genetic
aberrations. Therefore, EBV BALF3 is a potential factor that mediates the impact of
EBV on NPC relapse.

70% after primary treatment. However, the incidence rates
of local-regional relapse and distant metastasis, both of
which are the major risks of patient death, are still more
than 20% [3-7] and the cause remains enigmatic.
EBV is a human γ-herpesvirus that infects more
than 90% of the adult population worldwide. EBV is a
causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and is highly
associated with several human malignancies, including
NPC. The etiological association of NPC with EBV
infection has been strongly supported by various clinical
and epidemiological studies. Viral DNA and lytic gene
products such as early antigen diffuse (EA-D), early
antigen restricted (EA-R), BZLF1, BRLF1, BMLF1,
gp220, lytic latent membrane protein 1, DNase, membrane
antigen, viral capsid antigen (VCA) and BALF1 may
be detected in NPC biopsies [8-14]. Serological studies

INTRODUCTION
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an endemic
cancer, which is distributed predominantly through
certain geographic areas and in particular racial/ethnic
populations. In Southern China and Southeast Asia,
especially among Cantonese men, the incidence rate of
NPC is approximately 10 to 50 per 100,000 person-years;
in addition, it also occurs sporadically in other parts
of the world, including native populations in Canada,
Greenland, Alaska, the Middle East and North Africa
[1, 2]. The endemic nature, as well as carcinogenesis, of
this disease are considered a consequence of Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) infection, together with environmental and
host genetic factors. To date, the 5-year survival rate of
locally advanced NPC patients can reach approximately

have reported that patients with NPC generally exhibit
high levels of IgA antibodies against EBV EA and VCA
[15-21] and elevated titers of neutralizing antibodies
against EBV DNA replication-related enzymes such as
DNase, DNA polymerase and thymidine kinase also are
detectable in the sera of patients with this disease [21-28].
Moreover, the titers of these antibodies increase with the
stage of NPC [16-18, 28] and patients with remission after
effective therapy show a decline of the antibodies over
time. However, a reversal to increasing titers is seen in
long-term survivors with relapse or metastasis [16-18,
20, 23]. Therefore, these prospective and retrospective
investigations suggest that the antibodies against EBV
lytic antigens are indicative serological markers for
the prognosis and diagnosis of NPC. Taking these
observations together, EBV plays a critical role in the
development of NPC.
Genomic instability is defined as an increase in
the frequency of genetic alterations, ranging from the
nucleotide to the chromosome level and including subtle
sequence changes, chromosome number alterations,
chromosome translocations and gene amplifications.
This is an early event and leads to the emergence of the
characteristics of cancer in the cells [29, 30]. In NPC
biopsies, conventional cytogenetic analyses show tumor
cells with the appearance of polyploidy, aneuploidy and
marker chromosomes [31, 32]. High frequencies of loss
of heterozygosity (LOH) are observed for chromosomes
1p, 2p, 2q, 3p, 3q, 5q, 9p, 9q, 11q, 13q, 14q and 17q
[33-39]; moreover, a genome-wide analysis utilizing
comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) identifies
that gains of genomic copy number aberrations (CNAs)
cluster on chromosomes 1p, 1q, 2q, 3q, 5q, 6p, 6q, 7p,
7q, 8p, 8q, 9q, 11q, 12p, 12q, 15q, 17q, 18q, 19p, 19q,
20p and 20q and losses are among 1p, 3p, 5q, 9p, 9q,
11q, 13q, 14q and 16q [40-44]. In addition, the extent of
these alterations is correlated with NPC stage, relapse and
metastasis [39, 40, 43]. Accordingly, genomic instability
occurs comprehensively in NPC and contributes to tumor
progression.
Previously, we found that the EBV latent gene product
LMP1 and EBNA2 are capable of inducing genomic
instability in epithelial cells [45-48]. However, in studies
of the clinical features of NPC, NPC patients with high
titers of antibodies against EBV EA and VCA have tumor
cells with a high frequency of LOH [39, 49]. Elevation of
antibodies against EBV lytic gene products is considered
to be a sign of reactivation of EBV [50-53]. Therefore, we
investigated the lytic induction of EBV in NPC cell lines
and high frequencies of significant increases of micronuclei
and DNA double-strand breaks, relative to latency, were
revealed. With recurrent reactivation of EBV, the occurrence
of micronuclei and structural chromosomal aberrations
accumulate in the cells and frequent CNAs are produced
predominantly on chromosomes 3, 7, 8, 9 and X [54, 55].
These results suggest that EBV reactivation could cause
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

genomic instability in the host cells and is an underlying
factor of NPC relapse. Furthermore, EBV DNase and
BGLF4, lytic gene products, were shown to be able to elicit
genomic instability [56, 57]. EBV BALF3 is expressed after
EBV reactivation and is a terminase, which cleaves newly
synthesized viral DNA and enables the translocation of unit
length genomes into procapsids during the lytic cycle [58].
In addition, our preliminary screening suggests that BALF3
is involved in the induction of host genomic instability.
In this study, we examined EBV BALF3 expressed by
recurrent induction to explore its effects not only on host
genomes but also its tumorigenic properties in NPC cells
and a genome-wide analysis was used to determine the
differentially expressed genes involved, including cancer
capability-related genes and oncogenes.

RESULTS
Effect of EBV BALF3 on genomic instability.
To determine whether EBV BALF3 (NCBI GenBank
accession no. AFY97901) can cause genomic instability in
host cells, TW01 cells were transiently transfected with
pEGFP-C1-BALF3 and were examined for the formation
of micronuclei, which arise during mitosis from acentric
chromosome fragments and lagging whole chromosomes
and are used as a biomarker for chromosome breakage
and loss [59, 60]. A representative immunoblot shows
that increasing GFP-BALF3 expression was detected in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1A) and the numbers
of micronuclei correlated with the expression kinetics
of BALF3, increasing by up to approximately 1.0, 1.9,
2.8, 3.3 and 4.3% with pEGFP-C1-BALF3 at doses of
0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 μg, respectively (Figure 1B).
The phosphorylation of serine 139 in the C-terminal
tail of the histone H2A variant, γH2AX, is initiated
in chromatin by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
[61]. The cells expressing GFP-BALF3 exhibited more
H2AX phosphorylation than the mock and pEGFP-C1
transfections, detected by immunofluorescence staining
with an antibody specific to γH2AX (Figure 1G),
suggesting that EBV BALF3 could induce DSBs.
Moreover, a recent study in our laboratory has shown that
alanine substitution of the glycine residue at amino acid 624
of EBV BALF3 results in reduced endonucleolytic activity
[58]. Therefore, the coding region of BALF3 in pEGFP-C1BALF3 was mutated by replacement of glycine 624 with
alanine, with the result that the occurrence of micronuclei
and H2AX phosphorylation induced by the G624A mutant
was reduced to a significant extent, compared to the wildtype transfection (Figure 1C, D and G), confirming that
EBV BALF3 could generate chromosome breakage and
loss and DSBs. These results were also seen in an additional
NPC cell line, HONE-1 (Figure 1E, F and G). According to
these observations, EBV BALF3 is able to induce genomic
instability in host cells.

For long-term expression experiments, we esta­
blished an EBV BALF3-inducible NPC cell line,
TW01TREx-BALF3, which harbors the BALF3 coding
region with a V5 tag, the expression of this gene product
being induced by DOX treatment. Comparing the
physical properties of TW01TREx-VC and -BALF3 cells,
TW01TREx-BALF3 cells showed more micronuclei
and H2AX phosphorylation after induction and both of
the DNA damage indicators were increased with DOX
at concentrations from 0 to 50 ng/ml (Figure 2A and B).
After more than two rounds of the host cell cycle, the
accumulation of DNA damage was clear and the cell
population with micronuclei increased to approximately
9.2% at 48 h post-induction in TW01TREx-BALF3 cells
(Figure 2C and D). The combination of siBALF3-1 and -2
for gene silencing verified the specific effect of EBV
BALF3 on DNA damage (Figure 2E and F). In addition,
under DOX induction at the maximal concentration of
50 ng/ml, there was no obvious cytotoxicity in the cells
up to 96 h post-induction (Figure 2G). Therefore, this
inducible cell line provides further evidence supporting
the effect of EBV BALF3 on genomic instability and is a
tool for further long-term studies.

TW01TREx-BALF3 (P1), a common reference, a clear
increase of CNAs occurred in TW01TREx-BALF3+DOX
(P15) and these were seen on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22 and X; in contrast, relatively
few CNAs were detected in TW01TREx-VC+DOX
(P15), TW01TREx-BALF3 (P15) and TW01TRExBALF3+DOX (P1) (Figure 3C). Data filtering of array
CGH with high aberration scores, > 10 for amplification
and < -10 for deletion, reveals high-level gains of altered
loci in the TW01TREx-BALF3+DOX (P15) genome,
located on chromosomes 3, 6, 11, 19, 22 and X, and
losses were among chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11,
12, 15, 16, 18 and X, whereas TW01TREx-VC+DOX
(P15), TW01TREx-BALF3 (P15) and TW01TRExBALF3+DOX (P1) had no significant aberrations. These
data are summarized in Table 1. In addition, there was no
apparent CNA generation under DOX treatment, single
induction of BALF3 expression and long-term cell culture.
From the results of micronucleus assay coupled with array
CGH analysis, EBV BALF3 with recurrent expression
may be seen to play an important role in inducing
aggravated genomic instability in the cells.

Contribution of EBV BALF3 to the tumorigenic
properties of NPC cells.

Accumulation of genomic instability after
recurrent expression of EBV BALF3.

Most cancers acquire a number of specific attributes
during their development, including tissue invasion and
metastasis [63]. To determine whether recurrent EBV
BALF3 expression may lead to the malignant development
of NPC cells, the repeatedly induced cell lines were
analyzed for their tumorigenic phenotypes, including
cell migration, cell invasion and spheroid formation.
TW01TREx-BALF3 cells with DOX induction were
subjected to cell migration and invasion assays and the
percentage of closure increased by up to approximately
53.0, 56.7, 58.4 and 65.2% for passages 1, 5, 10 and
15, respectively, relative to the baseline of each group
(Figure 4A and B). In addition, the average number of
invading cells at passages 1, 5, 10 and 15 increased by up
to approximately 649, 1032, 1180 and 1319, respectively
(Figure 4C and D). Therefore, TW01TREx-BALF3 cells
with DOX induction exhibit more migratory and invasive
behavior than the TW01TREx-VC cell groups and cells
with mock induction and there is a high correlation
between these aggravated properties and the number of
rounds of induction.
Most cells are present in three-dimensional
structures in the human body and the formation of
multicellular spheroids represents a tissue-like architecture
and models the response to cell migration and invasion,
as well as intercellular adhesion. Here, in a matrix of
0.7% agarose, TW01TREx-BALF3+DOX (P15) cells
formed spheroids with a diameter of 264.2 μm, which
was larger than those of TW01TREx-BALF3+DOX (P1),

Because EBV reactivation may occur periodically
prior to NPC relapse [62], the expression of EBV BALF3
was induced and recovered to a basal level repeatedly
in TW01TREx-BALF3 cells, with DOX treatment and
removal, to imitate the natural situation. The experimental
protocol is illustrated in Figure 3A. DOX induction at a
concentration of 5 ng/ml for 24 h led to BALF3 expression
and the decrease followed removal of the inducer for a
further 24 h, determining the procedure for recurrent
EBV BALF3 expression in this study (Supplementary
Figure S1). Following this protocol, recurrent induction
was carried out over 15 passages and cells at passages
1, 5, 10 and 15 were harvested for further studies. The
detection of micronuclei in TW01TREx-BALF3 cells
after induction increased by up to approximately 3.7, 5.4,
6.0 and 6.5% for passages 1, 5, 10 and 15, respectively
(Figure 3B). Similarly, micronucleus formation increased
more in HONE-1 cells by five rounds of transfection
of pEGFP-C1-BALF3 than the single transfection and
the controls (Supplementary Figure S2). Furthermore,
array CGH analysis was used for surveillance of CNAs
on the host genome to investigate the effect of recurrent
EBV BALF3 expression on genetic alterations. Here,
this analysis was applied to TW01TREx-VC+DOX
(P15) (TW01TREx-VC cells with DOX treatment
harvested at passage 15), TW01TREx-BALF3 (P1),
TW01TREx-BALF3 (P15), TW01TREx-BALF3+DOX
(P1) and TW01TREx-BALF3+DOX (P15). Compared to

(P15) and the groups with mock induction (Figure 4E and

cells were examined in a harder matrix, 1% agarose,
and aggregated into a cluster, whereas the cells of the
other groups were dispersed on the surface of the matrix
(Figure 4E). These results suggest that the potential
for intercellular adhesion, in addition to cell migration
and invasion, was enhanced by recurrent EBV BALF3
expression.
Based on the dramatically increased tumorigenic
properties of NPC cells induced by recurrent EBV BALF3
expression observed above, the TW01TREx-VC+DOX,
TW01TREx-BALF3 and TW01TREx-BALF3+DOX cells
at passages 1 and 15 were injected subcutaneously into
NOD/SCID mice to evaluate the effect of recurrent EBV
BALF3 expression on tumor growth. Weekly monitoring
of tumor growth revealed that tumors were formed by all
of the cell groups and the size and weight of tumor nodules
from TW01TREx-BALF3+DOX (P15) cells were up to
approximately 2105.1 mm3 and 1523.3 mg, respectively, at
week 6 post-inoculation and developed more actively than
the other cell groups (Figure 5A to C). Therefore, highly
recurrent induction of EBV BALF3 may contribute to the
progressive malignancy of tumors.

features 991 differentially expressed genes, including
428 overexpressed and 563 underexpressed genes,
compared to TW01TREx-BALF3 (P1). The biological
representation of these genes was unified by DAVID, a
bioinformatics resource for functional annotation, and
the terms of gene ontology set were related to capabilities
for the characteristics of cancer, including cell adhesion,
cell death, the immune system, cell migration, cell
growth, vasculature development, precursor metabolites
and energy generation, defense response, cell cycle,
DNA repair and DNA damage response [63]. These sets
included 172 altered genes (Supplementary Table S1).
Furthermore, comparison of the RNA expression array
and array CGH results revealed 62 genes which were
differentially expressed in both. Among 62 altered genes,
16 were overexpressed and 46 were underexpressed and
these are listed in Table S1 (Figure 6A and B). In addition,
5 oncogenes identified by NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm
.nih.gov/gene) and in the relevant literature, EVI1, FIGF,
PAK1, SOX2 and TP63 were overexpressed and present
in the data sets of both arrays (Figure 6C). Therefore,
recurrent expression of EBV BALF3 in NPC cells leads to
differential expression of various cancer capability-related
genes and oncogenes, which may be attributable to genetic
aberrations.

DISCUSSION
The detection of antibodies against EBV antigens
in the sera of NPC patients was reported as early as 1966
[64]. So far, numerous clinical tests have shown that
patients with NPC have EBV lytic gene products and IgA
antibodies against EBV lytic antigens in tumor biopsies
and sera, respectively; in addition, NPC tissues contain
the linear form of viral DNA, which is consistent with
the detection of replicative RNAs [65, 66]. Moreover, the

titers of IgA antibodies against EBV EA, VCA and DNase
are lower in the sera of patients with other EBV-associated
diseases, such as infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt’s
lymphoma and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, than with NPC [16,
22, 67]. Accordingly, these findings indicate significant
levels of EBV reactivation in NPC. Furthermore, NPC
also shows various limited expression patterns of EBV
lytic genes, which account for an incomplete process
of virion production [11, 65], and no viral particles can
be detected in tumor tissues, despite the expression of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lytic gene products and the increased titers of anti-lytic
antigen IgA antibodies [9, 10, 12, 68]. This suggests that
an abortive lytic cycle may occur in NPC and may protect
the cells from death, which could provide an environment
for the occult influence of EBV reactivation on the cells.
EBV BALF3 is required for viral DNA cleavage
and packaging during the lytic cycle. To investigate
the effect of BALF3 on uninfected cells, BALF3 was
expressed alone in NPC cells and these were examined
for genetic alterations using several methods, showing

that the BALF3 expression led to the induction of
micronuclei, DNA strand breaks and genomic CNAs
(Figure 1, 2 and 3). BALF3 has nuclease activity and
the BALF3-mediated nucleolytic reaction occurs not
only in the terminal repeats of the EBV genome, which
contain cleavage/packaging signals, but also in vitro in
plasmid DNA without the terminal repeat sequence [58].
Similarly, nonspecific cleavage also has been reported for
the terminases of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and
bacteriophage T4. HCMV UL56 can cleave plasmid DNA
in vitro in the absence of the a sequence and bacteriophage
T4 gp17 carries out random cleavage of the Escherichia
coli genomic DNA in vivo [69, 70]. In addition,
Figure 1D, F and G reveal that a mutation within
the putative ATP-binding motif of BALF3, which is
responsible for nuclease activity [58], significantly
reduced the numbers of micronuclei and phosphorylation
of H2AX detected following wild-type BALF3 expression.
On this basis, the genetic alterations of cells caused by
EBV BALF3 may be attributed to its nuclease activity.
Phosphorylated H2AX is a mediator in response
to DNA damage, which recruits DNA repair proteins at
the chromatin lesion to carry out repair, and it has been
reported to be associated with numerous cancers, including
oral squamous cell, esophageal, breast, non-small cell
lung, gastric, bladder, colorectal carcinoma, as well as
NPC [71-79], suggesting that DNA damage occurs and
may play a role in the development of cancers although
this correlation remains to be understood. Previously, EBV
infection was found to induce H2AX phosphorylation
in NPC cells through its reactivation [55]. In this study,
NPC cells exhibited γH2AX by expression of EBV lytic
gene product BALF3 and aggravated genomic instability
upon recurrent BALF3 expression. In addition, cancer is
considered a consequence of accumulation of molecular
damage via multiple replication and selection events [80],
suggesting that the progressive tumorigenic features in
NPC cells may be due to accumulation of non-random
genomic instability induced by BALF3. Moreover,
although BALF3 triggered the DNA damage response
(DDR), phosphorylation of H2AX, no conspicuous
cytotoxicity and inhibition of cell proliferation were
shown in host cells in the long-term experiments.
Regarding DDR, γH2AX is not only a biomarker for
DNA damage but also the induction of senescence and
mTOR overactivation, which is defined as pseudo-DDR
[81]. The atypical DDR is induced by various stimuli,
such as senescence and DNA replication stress, which
can be suppressed by blockage of mTOR activity [81-83].
Furthermore, combination of activation of the mTOR
pathway and avoidance of cell cycle arrest account for
carcinogenesis [80]. In NPC cell lines and tissues, factors
involved in the mTOR pathway, such as PI3K and AKT,
are commonly activated [84-87] and mTOR inhibitors
are validated and evaluated for clinical therapies [88-91].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Accordingly, it is also a possibility that activation of
the mTOR pathway might take place in NPC cells after
BALF3 expression, in addition to low-dose DNA damage,
which lead to tumor progression.
Fluctuations of anti-EBV VCA IgA antibody titers
can be seen in healthy individuals and these increase
before the onset of NPC, as well as in patients with relapse
of NPC [62, 92, 93], revealing that EBV reactivation
occurs periodically in nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues. To
imitate the reactivation of EBV in nature, in our previous
study, NPC cell lines bearing the EBV genome were
treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)
and sodium butyrate (SB), known inducers of the EBV
lytic cycle, through repeated cycles of lytic induction
and recovery, resulting in remarkable genomic instability
and tumorigenic phenotypes of NPC cells [55]. Thus, in
this study, the recurrent expression protocol (Figure 3A)
for examining EBV BALF3 in NPC cells was designed
in accordance with the natural process and our previous
study. Moreover, in the long-term experiments, the
expression of BALF3 in TW01TREx-BALF3 cells was
induced by DOX at a concentration of 5 ng/ml. At this
concentration of DOX, the level of BALF3 mRNA was
up to approximately 30.2% of the maximal BALF3 level
in the EBV-positive NPC cell line, NA cells, treated with
40 ng/ml TPA and 3 mM SB for 36 h, as determined by
a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis (data
not shown). This indicates that a lower level of BALF3
expression was examined in this study and this may
represent early or incomplete viral reactivation. This led to
dramatic effects on the cells but did not generate apparent
cytotoxicity detectable by observations of cell growth and
ordinary cell culture under these conditions. On the other
hand, comparing the effects of recurrent EBV BALF3
expression and EBV reactivation induced repeatedly
by 40 ng/ml TPA and 3 mM SB on NPC cells [55], the
effect of whole virus expression gives a greater degree
of genomic instability and tumorigenic phenotypes than
expression of BALF3 alone, suggesting that the induced
expression of EBV BALF3 in this study at lower levels,
as discussed above, or EBV BALF3 might cooperate with
other viral gene products in the EBV-mediated promotion
of NPC relapse.
The malignant features of NPC progressed with
recurrent expression of EBV BALF3 and the various
differentially expressed cancer-related genes identified
above may be involved in this progressive development.
The gene expression profile acquired by RNA expression
array analysis includes 172 altered genes associated
with the features of cancer and 62 of these genes were
consistent with the results of array CGH, excluding their
expression levels relative to the control (Supplementary
Table S1 and Figure 6A and B) and implying that
some indirect contributory factors might be involved
in the regulation of gene expression, such as mutation

within a regulatory region, RNA and protein stability
and chromosome aberrations. We also identified
5 overexpressed oncogenes in both arrays, EVI1, FIGF,
PAK1, SOX2 and TP63 (Figure 6C). EVI1, ecotropic
viral integration site 1 [94], is a transcription factor that
regulates hematopoietic differentiation, cell proliferation
and cell death and is highly expressed in myeloid leukemia
and epithelial cancers. FIGF, c-fos induced growth factor,
or called vascular endothelial growth factor D [95, 96]
is a secreted glycoprotein that activates VEGF receptor
(VEGFR)-2 and -3 on the surface of epithelial cells to
drive the formation of blood vessels and lymphatics.
PAK1, p21-activated kinase 1 [97], is a downstream
effector of GTP-bound Rho GTPase Cdc42 and Rac,
activation of which stimulates cytoskeletal reorganization,
cell survival, cell proliferation, cell migration and antiapoptosis. SOX2, sex determining region Y-box 2 [98],
is a transcription factor that modulates the pluripotency
and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells and the early
development of tissues, as well as the cell proliferation,
cell invasion and apoptosis of several solid tumors. TP63,
tumor protein p63 [99], functions as a transcription factor
to regulate p53 target genes and is associated with the
cell cycle, DNA damage repair and apoptosis in epithelial
cancers. Among these oncogenes, EVI1, FIGF, SOX2 and
TP63 have been reported in and are correlated with NPC
[100-103], suggesting that EBV BALF3 enhances their
expression in the process of NPC relapse. Thus, PAK1 is
also believed to be a potential biomarker for diagnosis of
NPC although this remains to be confirmed.
Although EBV infection has been known for
many years to be closely associated with NPC, how
EBV contributes to NPC carcinogenesis remains to
be elucidated. It has been suggested that latent EBV
may participate in the carcinogenesis of NPC via highgrade preinvasive lesions of nasopharyngeal cells [104].
Moreover, we have shown that the EBV latent gene
product LMP1 and EBNA2 induce genomic instability in
epithelial cells [45, 48]. Considering that almost 100% of
people living in NPC high-risk regions carry latent EBV,
but only a few individuals develop NPC, latent infection
seems not to be the only scenario. Retrospective, crosssectional and prospective studies indicate that individuals
with high levels of antibodies against EBV lytic antigens,
markers of EBV reactivation, tend to have a higher risk
of developing NPC [19, 21, 23, 25, 92, 93, 105, 106],
suggesting that the EBV lytic cycle also may play an
important role in the carcinogenesis of NPC. Furthermore,
the presence of LOH can be detected in histologically
normal nasopharyngeal epithelia and the cases increase
dramatically in the population of NPC patients whether
in high or low-risk regions [107, 108]. In addition,
the titers of IgA antibodies against EBV lytic antigens
increase prior to the development of NPC [19-21, 25, 28,
93, 109], implying that genomic instability emerges at an
earlier time and contributes to the initiation of NPC, in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which EBV reactivation is involved. Thus, we compared
the effects of latency and the lytic cycle of EBV on the
genomic instability of NPC cells and found that recurrent
reactivation of EBV gives rise to a profound enhancement
of the tumorigenic properties of the cells, in addition to
promoting genomic instability [55]. Among the EBV
lytic gene products, we have shown that EBV DNase and
BGLF4 are able to induce genomic instability in NPC
cells [56, 57]. We provide evidence here that BALF3 is
another EBV lytic gene product contributing effectively
to the induction of genomic instability and the consequent
tumorigenicity of NPC cells. Therefore, the findings of
this study might be applied to the elucidation of NPC
carcinogenesis. Because blocking BALF3 retards the
replication of EBV [58], it is possible that EBV BALF3 is
as another target for preventing the development of NPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
NPC-TW01 (TW01) and HONE-1 are human
nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines, derived from the
tumor of a Taiwanese patient and a Chinese patient,
respectively, which have lost the EBV genome [110,
111]. TW01 and HONE-1 cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Biological Industries) and incubated at 37oC and 5%
CO2. TW01TREx-VC and TW01TREx-BALF3 cells
were established from TW01TREx cells, TW01 cells
express stably the tetracycline repressor, transfected with
pLenti4 (Invitrogen) and pLenti4-BALF3, respectively,
and selected by 25 μg/ml blasticidin (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 500 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). TW01TREx-VC
and TW01TREx-BALF3 cells are TW01TREx cells
harboring pLenti4 and pLenti4-BALF3, respectively, and
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine
serum (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37oC and 5% CO2.
In addition, the selected clones were maintained by
supplementation with 12.5 μg/ml blasticidin and
250 μg/ml zeocin. For the induction of BALF3 expression,
TW01TREx-BALF3 cells were treated with doxycycline
(DOX) (Sigma-Aldrich).

Transfection
Cells were transfected with plasmids or small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) using transfection agents
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen).
Briefly, for the expression of EBV BALF3 in TW01 cells,
the cells were transfected with the indicated concentration
of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech Laboratories) or pEGFP-C1BALF3 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 37oC
for 4 h and the culture medium was refreshed prior to

Tet-regulated BALF3 inducible cell lines, TW01TREx
cells were transfected with 3 μg pLenti4 or pLenti4BALF3 using Lipofectamine 2000 at 37oC for 4 h and
the culture medium was refreshed, followed by overnight
incubation at 37oC and antibiotic selection. For the
knockdown of EBV BALF3, TW01TREx-BALF3 cells
were transfected with the indicated concentration of
Stealth RNAi siRNA specific to BALF3 or Negative

expressed as percentages.

Indirect immunofluorescence staining
Slide-cultured cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min
and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 at room
temperature for 5 min. The fixed and permeabilized
cells were blocked in 4% fetal bovine serum at room
temperature for 30 min and incubated with the antiγH2AX antibody (Upstate) at room temperature for 1 h
prior to the incubation of Rhodamine Red-X-labeled goat
anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) at
room temperature for another 1 h. DNA was stained with
Hoechst33258 at room temperature for 30 s. The slides
were covered with mounting medium and photographed
using a fluorescence microscope.

Western blotting

Cell proliferation assay

Cell extracts were harvested by radioimmuno­
precipitation (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris [pH7.5], 150 mM
NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Igepal CA-630 and
protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche Applied Science]) for
20 min on ice and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10
min at 4oC to collect the supernatants. The lysates were
mixed with bromophenol blue buffer and then heated at
95oC for 5 min. The samples were separated by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) at 100 V and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane (GE Healthcare) at 300 mA for 90 min in a
cold room. The membrane was soaked in 5% skim milk at
room temperature for 1 h. After blocking, the membrane
was incubated with primary antibodies specific to green
fluorescent protein (GFP) (Clontech Laboratories), V5
(Invitrogen), γH2AX (Cell Signaling) and glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Biodesign) at 4oC
overnight prior to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory)
at room temperature for 1 h. The signal was detected
by development with an enhanced chemiluminescence
substrate (PerkinElmer) and exposure to X-ray film
(Fujifilm).

Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at 1 × 103
cells/well and incubated at 37oC and 5% CO2 for 0, 24, 48,
72 and 96 h. After incubation, WST-1 reagent (Roche) was
added to the culture medium and incubated for 2 h. The
dye solution produced by metabolically active cells was
quantified by an ELISA reader (Tecan) with absorbance at
440 and 650 nm.

Recurrent expression of EBV BALF3
TW01TREx-VC and -BALF3 cells were seeded
and treated with 5 ng/ml DOX at 37oC and 5% CO2 for
24 h and then the culture medium was refreshed prior
to incubation for another 24 h, which is defined as one
passage (P). After incubation, the cells were trypsinized
and reseeded for the next passage. In this study, the
periodic induction was performed up to 15 passages and
the cells were used for further studies.

Array-based comparative genomic hybridization
(array CGH)
Array CGH was carried out according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Technologies).
Briefly, genomic DNA was purified using a DNeasy
Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to SurePrint G3 Human
CGH Microarray Kit 1 × 1M and TW01TREx-BALF3
without DOX treatment at passage 1 was used as the
common reference in this study. Following hybridization
and washing steps, the array slides were scanned and
features were obtained by Feature Extraction (Agilent
Technologies). The extracted features were subsequently
analyzed by Agilent Genomic Workbench version 7.0.4.0
(Agilent Technologies). The enrichment of aberrant
regions was determined using the Z-score detection

Micronucleus assay
Micronucleus assay was carried out as described
previously [55] with some modifications. Slide-cultured
cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room
temperature for 20 min and then permeabilized in 0.1%
Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. DNA was
stained with Hoechst33258 (Sigma-Aldrich) at room
temperature for 30 s and the slides were covered with
a mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). For the
evaluation of micronucleus occurrence, more than 1 × 103
fixed cells were examined and photographed using

estimated using the following formula: volume = length ×
width2 × 0.52. Sacrifices were performed at week 6 and the
tumors were removed and weighed.

Cell migration assay

RNA expression analysis

Cell migration assay was carried out according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Platypus Techno­
logies). Briefly, cells were seeded onto 96-well plates
containing Oris stoppers and incubated at 37oC and
5% CO2 overnight. After incubation, the stoppers
were removed and the cells were incubated for 12 h to
permit cell migration. The images were photographed
by a optical microscope (Olympus). The area of a
cell-free zone was measured by ImageJ (National
Institutes of Health) and cell migration was presented
as percent closure, which was calculated using the
following formula: [(­pre-migration)area— (migration)area/
(pre-migration)area] × 100.

RNA expression analysis was carried out according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix). Briefly,
RNA was purified by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and singlestranded cDNA was generated using a WT cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Affymetrix) and then fragmented and labeled with WT
Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix). The samples were
hybridized with GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array and
scanned with a GeneChip scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).
Raw data were processed with Partek Genomics Suite
6.6 (Partek) for normalization and gene level analysis.
Gene ontology was determined using the Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID; http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) [112, 113].

Cell invasion assay

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Cell invasion assay was carried out as described
previously [55] with some modifications. Briefly, the
membranes of HTS FluoroBlok inserts (BD Biosciences)
were coated with Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix
(BD Biosciences) and cells were resuspended in 2%
tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum-containing DMEM
and loaded into the upper chambers, which were placed
in 24-well plates with 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine
serum-containing DMEM, and then incubated at 37oC
and 5% CO2 for 12 h. After incubation, the cells on the
membrane were fixed with methanol at 4oC for 15 min and
stained with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) at
room temperature for 10 min. The signal was detected and
photographed using a fluorescence microscope to count
the number of invaded cells.
