BACKGROUND. Despite advances in first-line therapy, there are few data on treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) at recurrence. Temozolomide (TMZ) is
well tolerated and may have activity despite prior TMZ exposure if novel dose
schedules are used.

METHODS. The authors reviewed their experience with a continuous TMZ schedule (50 mg/m2 daily), given at progression after conventional 5-day TMZ. Patients

months-10 months). A median of 5 cycles of TMZ was given, and 6-month PFS
was 57%. In Group 3, 14 patients with a median age of 49 years (range, 34 years56 years) received continuous TMZ; 2 partial responses and 6 with stable disease were seen, with a 6-month PFS of 42%. Toxicities were mild and well
tolerated; lymphopenia was common but no serious opportunistic infections
were identified.

CONCLUSIONS. Although retrospective, our results demonstrate that continuous
daily administration of TMZ is an active regimen despite prior TMZ therapy. The
excellent tolerability of this regimen may allow future combination with other alkylating agents or with novel therapies. Cancer 2008;113:2152–7.  2008 American

T

emozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent indicated for the
treatment of malignant glioma at relapse and, more recently, as
part of the standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). When administered daily, concurrent
with radiotherapy (RT) and followed by adjuvant treatment, temozolomide improves 2-year survival of patients with newly diagnosed
GBM from 11.2% to 27.3%, and 4-year suvival from 3.8% to 12.9%.1,2

Temozolomide in Malignant Glioma/Perry et al

The benefit of TMZ in patients with GBM has been
correlated with epigenetic silencing of the DNA
repair enzyme 06-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) in tumor tissue retrieved at the initial
surgical diagnosis,3 and MGMT status may be an important predictor of prolonged survival.4 Despite
these advances, GBM remains an essentially incurable disease and improvements in both front-line and
salvage therapies are urgently needed.
There is no consensus as to the optimal secondline therapy for patients with recurrent malignant glioma, although lomustine, procarbazine, etoposide,
carboplatin, tamoxifen, and irinotecan are all commonly considered and used.5 Unfortunately, these
therapies have a limited response rate and, even
when effective, the durability of response is modest.
There is growing interest in the use of therapies
targeted at the robust and aberrant vasculature in
malignant glioma. Metronomic chemotherapy, a
term used to describe chemotherapy delivered on a
continuous or near-continuous basis, but below the
typical maximum tolerated dose, is believed to function through an antiangiogenic mechanism.6 Lower
daily doses of chemotherapy on a protracted schedule may inhibit endothelial cell recovery and restrict
mobilization and activity of bone marrow-derived
circulating endothelial precursors, thus contributing
to antiangiogenic activity.7 Few clinical trials have
explored metronomic chemotherapy in the setting of
malignant glioma.
Temozolomide appears to be an ideal drug for
metronomically delivered regimens. It is an oral
agent, well tolerated, and can be given in a variety of
dosing schedules. For example, in addition to the
conventional approved dosing of 150 mg/m2 to 200
mg/m2 given 5 days of each 28-day cycle, novel schedules such as 75 mg/m2 given 21 of 28 days and 150
mg/m2 7 days on/7 days off have been described.
These schedules allow greater TMZ dose intensity
per cycle of delivery; however, these are not continuous regimens and may not be truly metronomic, as
they may allow endothelial and tumor cell recovery
during treatment gaps. In vitro studies of continuously delivered TMZ found 10-fold increased sensitivity of endothelial cells compared with glioma cells
in vitro.7 Both conventional and continuously delivered TMZ have been shown to have similar pharmacokinetic properties, linear kinetics, and similar
cytotoxic activity when tested in xenograft models of
glioma.8
Short-term continuous delivery of TMZ (75 mg/
m2 daily for 6 weeks) has been shown to be effective
and well tolerated during initial therapy when combined with fractionated external beam RT for GBM.1

2153

After completion of this chemoradiation regimen,
patients are offered the conventional adjuvant TMZ
150 mg/m2 to 200 mg/m2 regimen on 5 days of each
28-day cycle. At the time of progression of disease,
either during or after completion of adjuvant treatment, patients are usually offered treatment other
than TMZ under the assumption that drug resistance
to TMZ is present.9 The concept of rechallenging a
patient at recurrence with the same chemotherapy
agent is new in neuro-oncology, but has some precedent in other diseases such as ovarian and colorectal
cancer.10,11 If the available alternative schedules of
TMZ work through different mechanisms of action
than conventional TMZ, it may be possible to offer
TMZ rechallenge in patients with disease progression
during or after their initial therapy.
The rationale for TMZ rechallenge in previously
TMZ-treated patients includes not only the previously discussed potential antiangiogenic mechanism of action of continuously delivered drug, but
also the potential for novel schedules to overcome
TMZ resistance. One of the principal mechanisms of
TMZ resistance is the MGMT repair pathway. TMZ
induces an alkylating lesion at the O-6 position of
methylguanine and, left unrepaired, causes cytotoxicity and apoptosis. High levels of intracellular MGMT
inhibit the therapeutic effect of TMZ by removing
the methyl group resulting from temozolomide alkylation. However, in the process of DNA repair, MGMT
is consumed as a so-called ‘‘suicide protein.’’ The
MGMT pathway therefore represents a target for
therapeutic modulation; perhaps especially for
patients in whom epigenetic silencing of the MGMT
promoter region is not present, and high levels of
MGMT protein remain expressed.12 Novel protracted
schedules of administration of TMZ deplete MGMT
activity detected in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells13; thus, these chemotherapy schedules may
overcome TMZ resistance and restore chemosensitivity and cytotoxic damage in previously resistant cells.
Another rationale for the use of alternative TMZ
regimens is dose intensity. The conventional 5-day
TMZ regimen will deliver 750 mg/m2 to 1000 mg/m2
per month, whereas other schedules allow higher,
well-tolerated dose delivery. For example, the 21-day
schedule delivers 1575 mg/m2 per month, and the 7
day on/off schedule delivers 2100 mg/m2 per month.
In this study, we report our experience with a 50mg/m2 schedule, delivered daily and continuously
throughout therapy; the dose intensity of this schedule is 1400 mg/m2 per 28 days and therefore delivers
1.4 to 1.9 times more TMZ than the conventional
regimen, in addition to having potential antiangiogenic and MGMT-depleting activity.

We reviewed our experience with continuous
TMZ, delivered at the time of progression after failure of conventional 5-day TMZ in patients with malignant glioma, to determine the potential efficacy
and tolerability of this regimen for further evaluation
in a prospective study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Research ethics board approval was obtained for the
purposes of a retrospective chart review of patients
treated with TMZ at Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional
Cancer Centre between January 2001 and July 2005.
We identified all patients treated with the continuous
50-mg/m2 daily regimen and extracted demographic,
treatment, and outcome details. Patients were given
TMZ at 50 mg/m2 daily, rounded to the nearest 5 mg
and seen monthly in clinical follow-up. Dose reduction by 25% was planned for grade 3 or 4 myelotoxicity. Imaging with brain computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging was obtained after every 2 cycles of therapy. Responses were recorded
according to the method of Macdonald et al,14 and
duration of response was determined as time from
the start of therapy to the time of progression. Antiemetic and infectious prophylaxis was not routinely
prescribed.
We grouped patients into 3 categories. The first
group was composed of patients with histologically
confirmed GBM who had surgery and conventional
external beam RT, and were followed without concurrent or adjuvant chemotherapy until their first recurrence. These patients were treated before local
adoption of the TMZ chemoradiation strategy. At first
recurrence, they received conventional TMZ given as
150 mg/m2 to 200 mg/m2 5 days of each 28-day
cycle. When these patients progressed, during conventional TMZ treatment, they were offered a change
to TMZ in the 50-mg/m2 daily regimen.
The second group was composed of patients
with GBM who received surgery, external beam RT
combined with concurrent TMZ, and then adjuvant
TMZ for a complete 6 cycles. At first progression
these patients were offered rechallenge with continuous TMZ at 50 mg/m2. The interval between discontinuation of adjuvant TMZ and time of relapse was
recorded.
The third group consisted of patients with anaplastic gliomas (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic
oligodendroglioma, or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma)
treated at the time of second relapse during conventional TMZ treatment. This group underwent surgery
and RT, and then was followed until relapse, when
they received TMZ at 150 mg/m2 to 200 mg/m2 on 5

days of each 28-day cycle. At the time of progression,
during conventional TMZ treatment, they were
offered continuous 50-mg/m2 TMZ treatment.

RESULTS
Patients With Recurrent GBM at Second Relapse While
Receiving Conventional TMZ Chemotherapy
There were 21 patients in this group of patients with
GBM who were treated with initial RT alone before
adoption of the RT/TMZ strategy. Median age was 54
years (range, 33 years-68 years), 11 had biopsy alone,
and 10 had subtotal surgical resections. All received
50 Gray to 60 Gray external beam RT with conventional fractionation. Patients experienced their first
progression at a mean of 4.5 months (range, 3
months-15 months) after completion of RT. At progression, 150 mg/m2 to 200 mg/m2 TMZ was delivered on 5 days of each 28-day cycle for a median of
3 cycles (range, 2-12 cycles) before second progression was confirmed on imaging studies. These
patients were then treated with temozolomide at 50
mg/m2 daily until progression. The overall clinical
benefit rate was 47% with no complete responses, 3
partial responses (14.3%), and 7 patients having
stable disease (33%) after at least 2 cycles of therapy.
Six-month progression-free survival (PFS) after second relapse was 17%.
Patients With Recurrent GBM at First Progression After
Concurrent Chemoradiation With TMZ and Adjuvant TMZ
There were 14 patients in this group. Median age
was 52 years (range, 38 years-62 years), 9 had subtotal resections, and 5 had a biopsy to establish the diagnosis of GBM. All received concurrent TMZ with
RT followed by 6 cycles of conventionally administered adjuvant TMZ and had at least stable disease
at the time of treatment completion. Patients were
followed with serial neuroimaging studies until first
progression, at which time treatment with TMZ at 50
mg/m2 given continuously was offered. The median
number of months since completion of adjuvant
TMZ was 3 months (range, 2 months-10 months).
The median number of cycles of continuous TMZ
delivered was 5 months, and we observed 2 (14%)
partial responses and 9 (64%) instances of stable disease. Six-month PFS from the time of first relapse
was 57%.
Patients With Recurrent Anaplastic Glioma at
Second Relapse While Receiving Conventional
TMZ Chemotherapy
There were 14 patients in this group; 3 had anaplastic astrocytoma, 4 had mixed anaplastic oligoastro-

Temozolomide in Malignant Glioma/Perry et al

cytomas, and 7 had anaplastic oligodendrogliomas.
Six of the 7 patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas had loss of heterozygosity of the critical regions
of chromosomes 1p and 19q. Median age of these
patients was 49 years (range, 34 years-56 years); all
were treated with surgery (11 subtotal resections, 3
biopsy alone) and initial RT. No adjuvant chemotherapy was used. Patients were followed until first progression, at which point they received adjuvant
chemotherapy with conventional TMZ at 150 mg/m2
to 200 mg/m2 given on 5 days of each 28-day cycle.
The median number of conventional TMZ cycles
administered was 6 (range, 4-12). At the time of second progression, while still on conventional temozolomide, a change to continuous treatment with TMZ
at 50 mg/m2 was offered. We observed 2 (14%) partial responses, and stable disease in 6 (43%), for an
overall clinical benefit rate of 57%. Six-month PFS
from the time of second relapse was 42%.

Toxicity
No nonhematological toxicities were detected during
continuous TMZ treatment. Hematological toxicity,
in particular lymphopenia, was frequent (Table 1).
Twelve (24%) patients had grade 1, 14 (29%) patients
had grade 2, and 5 (10%) patients had grade 3 lymphopenia. No patients received antibiotic prophylaxis, and no serious opportunistic infections
occurred. Six patients received treatment for oral
thrush during continuous TMZ treatment, and 2
patients were recorded as having a herpes zoster
exacerbation.

DISCUSSION
The ease of administration and tolerability of TMZ
makes this drug suitable for testing in a wide variety
of schedules. Our retrospective study of patients treated with continuous TMZ at 50 mg/m2 demonstrates
that this novel ‘‘metronomic’’ schedule is well tolerated and has activity both in patients refractory to
conventionally delivered TMZ and when used as a
rechallenge after a TMZ treatment break.
Rechallenge with TMZ at the time of tumor progression has been previously reported in small case
series. For example, Franceschi et al retrospectively
identified 14 patients with various types of glioma
with a history of response to conventional 5 of 28day TMZ.15 At the time of recurrence, their patients
were rechallenged with the same 5 of 28-day regimen
at a median interval of 12 months (range, 4 months39 months) after the conclusion of treatment. They
observed an overall clinical benefit rate of 43% and
6-month PFS of 36%. These results are comparable

to our similar group of patients rechallenged with
dose-dense metronomic TMZ, although our response
rate (64%) and 6-month PFS (57%) were higher.
Jauch et al recently reported their experience with 54
patients, half with GBM, who were rechallenged with
a variety of TMZ schedules (35 with 5 of 28 days, 7
with 7 days on/off, 4 with 21 of 28 days, and 7 with
continuous treatment).16 The overall clinical benefit
rate in GBM patients was 65%, and median time to
progression 20 weeks. Of patients who progressed
during initial conventional TMZ therapy, 8 of 12
responded to administration of 1 of the alternative
TMZ schedules.
Although many alternative TMZ schedules
appear to be well tolerated and have activity against
malignant glioma, the optimal dosing regimen is
unclear. The continuous TMZ regimen reported in
our study is of interest for several reasons. Protracted
TMZ regimens may overcome MGMT-mediated drug
resistance and offer a higher dose intensity per
month of delivery, and the continuous regimen
reported in our study may add the potential antiangiogenic activity of metronomically delivered chemotherapy.
Kong et al described 12 consecutive patients
offered daily TMZ at a dose of 40 mg/m2 at the time
of first progression after initial therapy.17 Their
patients previously received RT with or without
radiosurgery boost followed by a variety of chemotherapy regimens, including exposure to TMZ in conventional 5 of 28-day cycles. They observed 2
patients with a partial response after changing to the
continuous schedule and a median PFS of 3 months.
No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed in their
study.

TMZ is a generally well-tolerated medication. In
conventional dosing schedules, clinically significant
hematological toxicity is uncommon and usually easily managed. Our experience with continuous TMZ
reveals lymphopenia to be the most common toxicity
with this regimen. Over half of our patients experienced some degree of lymphopenia, although no serious opportunistic infections were encountered.
Immunosuppression is a common problem in
patients with malignant glioma, likely because of
multifactorial and converging risk factors such as the
presence of the disease itself, prolonged use of corticosteroid therapy, and the use of TMZ early in the
course of disease. TMZ is associated with CD41 specific lymphopenia, and the degree of iatrogenic
immunosuppression caused by TMZ requires careful
monitoring of these patients, who are at risk for the
complications of immune deficiency.18 Although it is
used in some centers, we did not routinely offer prophylaxis for infections such as Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia, as very few cases have occurred in
patients from our population base.
Our retrospective series has several limitations,
including potential issues with selection bias, and
incomplete data from the clinical records. We also
did not test for MGMT promoter methylation or
other biomarkers associated with response and
improved prognosis. As this is not a uniform patient
population, the reported rates of response PFS are
uncontrolled observations. Nonetheless our experience suggests that a 50-mg/m2 regimen of daily TMZ
has activity in the setting of recurrent TMZ-treated
malignant glioma, including GBM. We saw responses
and promising PFS in patients with GBM who were
rechallenged with continuous TMZ after a treatment
break, and we saw responses in patients who progressed while on the 5 of 28-day regimen. Continuous administration of TMZ at 50 mg/m2 daily may
act by depleting tumor MGMT, a hypothesis that
must be tested in a prospective setting, ideally with
correlation of serum MGMT activity and direct measurement of MGMT expression in tumor specimens.
Continuous TMZ may also work through an antiangiogenic mechanism, and this may be an advantage
when compared with the other common alternative
schedules, because these others are noncontinuous
and may allow endothelial and tumor cell recovery
between cycles. Correlation of TMZ activity in the
daily schedule with markers of angiogenesis (such as
serum vascular endothelial growth factor or measurement of circulating endothelial precursors) would
lend support to this hypothesis.
TMZ is the drug of choice for malignant gliomas
such as anaplastic astrocytoma at recurrence, and is

standard first-line treatment for glioblastoma multiforme. Optimal second-line therapy after TMZ failure
in these patients has not been defined. The response
rates and 6-month PFS in our patients treated with
continuous TMZ are similar to other conventional
palliative therapies such as lomustine.
Continuous daily TMZ administration appears to
be safe and well tolerated. Alternative dosing regimens of TMZ may well have a role as second-line
therapy of choice after TMZ failure and, given the
tolerability of the regimen, this schedule can be
tested in combination with other cytotoxic and novel
therapies. These results are part of the rationale for
an ongoing Canadian Brain Tumor Consortium 120patient prospective phase II study testing daily TMZ
in patients with recurrent GBM during or after standard chemoradiation.
