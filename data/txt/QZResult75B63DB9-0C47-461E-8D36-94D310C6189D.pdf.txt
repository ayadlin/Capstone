Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR1) is
expressed in cancer cell lines and tumors and, in pancreatic
and colon cancer cells, activation of VEGFR1 is linked to
increased tumor migration and invasiveness. Tolfenamic acid,
a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, decreases Sp protein
expression in Panc-1 and L3.6pl pancreatic cancer cells, and
this was accompanied by decreased VEGFR1 protein and
mRNA and decreased luciferase activity on cells transfected
with constructs (pVEGFR1) containing VEGFR1 promoter
inserts. Comparable results were obtained in pancreatic
cancer cells transfected with small inhibitory RNAs for Sp1,
Sp3, and Sp4 and all three proteins bound to GC-rich elements
in the VEGFR1 promoter. These results show that VEGFR1 is
regulated by Sp proteins and that treatment with tolfenamic
acid decreases expression of this critical angiogenic factor.
Moreover, in vitro studies in Panc-1 cells show that activation
of VEGFR1 by VEGFB to increase mitogen-activated protein
kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and cell migration on collagencoated plates is also inhibited by tolfenamic acid. Thus,
targeted degradation of Sp proteins is highly effective for
inhibiting VEGFR1 and associated angiogenic responses in
pancreatic cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):3286–94]

Introduction
Angiogenesis is a process involving new blood vessel formation
from existing vessels and is essential for tissue regeneration and
remodeling during wound healing and for the female reproductive
cycle (1–3). Angiogenesis also plays a role in several diseases,
including rheumatoid arthritis, proliferative retinopathy, psoriasis,
macular degeneration, and cancer, where this pathway is activated
during tumor progression, growth, and metastasis (1–6). Vascular
permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
was initially identified as a key regulator of angiogenesis and is a
member of the VEGF/platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family
of proteins that include VEGF and related splice variants (VEGF121,
VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206) and VEGFB-E placenta growth
factors 1 and 2 (1–3). These growth factors activate angiogenesis

through their specific interactions with VEGF receptors (VEGFR),
which are transmembrane tyrosine kinases and members of the
PDGF receptor gene family.
VEGFR1 (Flk-1), VEGFR2 (Flt-1/KDR), and VEGFR3 (Flt-4) are
the three major receptors for VEGF and related angiogenic factors.
The former two receptors are primarily involved in angiogenesis in
endothelial cells, whereas VEGFR3 promotes hematopoiesis and
lymphoangiogenesis (2, 3, 7, 8). VEGFR2 plays a critical role in
angiogenesis; homozygous knockout mice were embryonic lethal
[gestation day (GD) 8.5–9.0] and this was associated with the
failure to develop blood vessels (9). VEGFA binds with high affinity
to VEGFR2 and induces formation of a homodimer, which
subsequently activates downstream signaling pathways similar to
other receptor tyrosine kinases. Deletion of the VEGFR1 gene in
mice is also embryolethal at GD of 8.5; however, the embryonic
phenotype is different from that observed in the VEGFR2
knockouts because embryonic endothelial cells are highly overgrown and disorganized (10, 11). There is evidence that VEGFR1
acts, in part, as a decoy receptor that inhibits VEGFR2-mediated
angiogenesis (12–14); however, under some conditions, VEGFR1
may also cooperatively activate angiogenesis with VEGFR2 and this
response is both ligand and cell context dependent (14).
VEGFR1 is also expressed as a soluble truncated (sVEGFR1)
form, which does not contain the intracellular receptor tyrosine
kinase domains, and sVEGFR1 acts primarily to bind VEGF and
inhibit angiogenesis (15–18). VEGFR1 is expressed in a variety of
cancer cell lines and tumors (19–25) and, in colon and pancreatic
cancer cells, activation of VEGFR1 results in epithelial to
mesenchymal transition, which is linked to increased invasion
and migration of tumor cells (23–25). For example, VEGFB induced
phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
enhanced migration in pancreatic cancer cells, and VEGFR1neutralizing antibody inhibited these responses.
To develop agents that will modulate VEGFR1 expression, we
have investigated the molecular mechanism regulation of VEGFR1
expression in pancreatic cancer cells. The VEGFR1 promoter
contains multiple cis elements, including at least three GC-rich
sites that bind Sp proteins and a proximal early growth response-1
(Egr-1) binding sequence (26). Based on results of RNA interference
assays and the effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID) tolfenamic acid, which decreases Sp protein expression
(27), we have now shown that VEGFR1 expression is primarily
dependent on Sp proteins. Moreover, VEGFB-dependent activation
of VEGFR1, which increases MAPK phosphorylation and migration
in Panc-1 cells, is also inhibited by tolfenamic acid. Results of this
study show that, like VEGF and VEGFR2 (27–38), VEGFR1
expression is Sp protein dependent, indicating that agents, such

supplemented with 5% FBS. After 16 to 20 h when cells were 50% to 60%
confluent, reporter gene constructs were transfected using LipofectAMINE
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The effects of tolfenamic acid and
amproxicam on transactivation was investigated in Panc-1 and L3.6pl cells
cotransfected with (500 ng) different VEGFR1 constructs. Cells were treated
with DMSO (control) or with the indicated concentration of NSAIDs for 48 h,
and then luciferase activity of lysates (relative to h-galactosidase activity) was
determined. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) assay, nuclear
extracts from Panc-1 and L3.6pl cells were isolated as described previously
(30, 36), and aliquots were stored at 80jC until used (27).
Western Immunoblot. Cells were washed once with PBS and collected
by scraping in 200 AL lysis buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES, 0.5 mol/L sodium
chloride, 1.5 mmol/L magnesium chloride, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 10% (v/v)
glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 AL/mL Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma
Chemical)]. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h with intermittent
vortexing followed by centrifugation at 40,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. Equal
amounts of protein (60 Ag) from each treatment group were diluted with
loading buffer, boiled, and loaded onto 10% and 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel. Samples were electrophoresed and proteins were detected by
incubation with polyclonal primary antibodies Sp1 (PEP2), Sp3 (D-20),
Sp4 (V-20), HDAC (H-51), VEGFR1 (C-17), ERK1/2, pERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204),
and h-tubulin (H-235) followed by blotting with appropriate horseradish

peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody as described previously (27).
After autoradiography, band intensities were determined by a scanning laser
densitometer (Sharp Electronics Corp., Mahwah, NJ) using Zero-D
Scanalytics software (Scanalytics Corp., Billerica, MA).
EMSA. VEGFR1 oligonucleotides [5¶-CTCGTCGGCCCCCGCCCCTCT-3¶
(sense) and 5¶-AGAGGGGCGGGGGCCGACGAG-3¶ (antisense)] were synthesized and annealed, and 5-pmol aliquots were 5¶-end labeled using T4
kinase and [g-32P]ATP. A 30-AL EMSA reaction mixture contained f100
mmol/L KCl, 3 Ag crude nuclear protein, 1 Ag poly(dI-dC), with or without
unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide, and 10 fmol radiolabeled probe. After
incubation for 20 min on ice, antibodies against Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4 proteins
were added and incubated for another 20 min on ice. Protein-DNA
complexes were resolved by 5% PAGE as described previously (27). Specific
DNA-protein and antibody-supershifted complexes were observed as
retarded bands in the gel.
VEGFB activation of MAPK and cell migration. Panc-1 cells were
pretreated with DMSO, 50 Amol/L ampiroxicam, or 50 Amol/L tolfenamic
acid for 48 h and then treated with 50 ng/mL VEGFB for 5 and 10 min.
MAPK phosphorylation in the various treatment groups was then
determined by Western immunoblot analysis as described above. For
migration assays, Panc-1 cells were seeded in triplicates in six-well collagen
IV–coated plates and then treated with the selected NSAIDs for 24 h before

the scratch was made. A scratch through the central axis of the plate was
gently made using a sterile pipette tip. Cells were 70% confluent when the
scratch was made. Cells were then washed and treated with the DMSO
control, selected NSAIDs alone, or NSAIDs and VEGFB. Migration of the
cells into the scratch was observed at nine preselected points (three points
per well) at 0, 8, and 16 h. Results of this study were obtained at a 16 h time
point and one plate was stained using Diff-Quik.
Immunocytochemistry. Panc-1 cells were seeded in LabTek chamber
slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at 100,000 cells per well in
DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% FBS. Cells were then treated with the
selected NSAIDs, and after 48 h, the medium chamber was detached and
the remaining glass slides were washed in Dulbecco’s PBS. The
immunostaining for VEGFR1 was determined essentially as described
previously (27). Briefly, the glass slides were fixed with cold ( 20jC)
methanol for 10 min, and then slides were washed in 0.3% PBS/Tween 20 for
5 min (twice) before blocking with 5% goat serum in antibody dilution
buffer [stock solution: 100 mL PBS/Tween 20, 1 g bovine serum albumin, 45
mL glycerol (pH 8.0)] for 1 h at 20jC. After removal of the blocking solution,
VEGFR1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was added in antibody dilution buffer
(1:200) and incubated for 12 h at 4jC. Slides were washed for 10 min with
0.3% Tween 20 in 0.02 mol/L PBS (thrice) and incubated with FITCconjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) for 2 h at 20jC.
Slides were then washed for 10 min in 0.3% PBS-Tween 20 ( four times).
Slides were mounted in ProLonged antifading medium with 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole for nuclear counterstaining (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene,
OR), and coverslips were sealed using Nailslicks nail polish (Noxell Corp.,
Hunt Valley, MD). Fluorescence imaging was done using Carl Zeiss
Axiophoto 2 (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) and Adobe Photoshop 5.5
was used to capture the images. Previous studies showed that tolfenamic
acid decreased Sp protein expression in an orthotopic model for pancreatic
cancer, and tumor tissue from these animals was stained for VEGFR1
essentially as described (27).
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Panc-1 cells
were treated with DMSO (control) or with the indicated concentration of
NSAIDs for 24 h before total RNA collection. RNA concentration was
measured by UV 260:280 nm absorption ratio, and 200 ng/AL RNA was
used in each reaction for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). RNA
was reverse transcribed at 42jC for 25 min using oligo d(T) primer
(Promega) and subsequently PCR amplified of reverse transcription
product using 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 Amol/L of each gene-specific primer,
1 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 2.5 units AmpliTaq DNA
polymerase (Promega). The gene products were amplified using 22 to 25
cycles (95jC for 30 s, 56jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 30 s). The sequence of
the oligonucleotide primers used in this study was as follows: VEGFR1 5¶TGGGACAGTAGAAAGGGCTT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGTCCACTCCTTACACGACAA-3¶ (reverse) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) 5¶-AATCCCATCACCATCTTCCA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GTCATCATATTTGGCAGGTT-3¶ (reverse).

Following amplification in a PCR express thermal cycler (Hybaid US,
Franklin, MA), 20 AL of each sample were loaded on a 2% agarose gel
containing ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis was done at 80 V in 1 TAE
buffer for 1 h, and the gel was photographed by UV transillumination using
Polaroid film (Waltham, MA). VEGFR1, GAPDH, Sp1, and Sp4 band intensity
values were obtained by scanning the Polaroid on a Sharp JX-330 scanner;
background signal was subtracted; and densitometric analysis was done on
the inverted image using Zero-D software. Results are expressed as VEGFR1
band intensity values normalized to GAPDH values and then by averaging
three separate determinations for each treatment group.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA
and Scheffe’s test, and the levels of probability are noted. The results of cell
culture studies are expressed as mean F SD for at least three separate
(replicate) experiments for each treatment.

Results
The VEGFR1 gene promoter contains multiple GC-rich sites
that bind Sp proteins (26), and the role of these transcription
factors in mediating VEGFR1 expression was initially investigated
in Panc-1 cells by RNA interference using small inhibitor RNAs for
Sp1 (iSp1), Sp3 (iSp3), and Sp4 (iSp4). In cells transfected with a
construct (pVEGFR1A) containing a 1,160 to +304 VEGFR1
promoter insert linked to luciferase cotransfection with iSp1, iSp3,
and iSp4 significantly decreased luciferase activity (42–33%;
Fig. 1A). Similar results were observed in Panc-1 cells cotransfected with iSp1, iSp3, and iSp4 and deletion constructs
pVEGFR1B and pVEGFR1C, which contain the 886 to +304
and 334 to +304 VEGFR1 promoter inserts, respectively (Fig. 1B
and C). Previous studies have shown that Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 are
expressed in Panc-1 cells (30), and the results suggest that
VEGFR1 expression is Sp dependent. Further confirmation that Sp
proteins regulated VEGFR1 expression was determined in parallel
studies, which show that transfection with the small inhibitory
RNAs iSp1, iSp3, and iSp4 decreased Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins
levels, respectively, compared with cells transfected with a
nonspecific small inhibitory RNA (iNS; Fig. 1D). Moreover,
decreased Sp protein expression was paralleled by decreased
levels of VEGFR1 protein (Fig. 1D), and these results were
observed in three replicate experiments showing that Sp1, Sp3,
and Sp4 proteins were significantly decreased only by their
corresponding small inhibitory RNAs, whereas VEGFR1 was
significantly decreased by iSp1, iSp3, and iSp4 (Fig. 1D).
Previous studies in this laboratory showed that the NSAID
tolfenamic acid induced proteasome-dependent degradation of

Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in pancreatic cancer cells, whereas ampiroxicam
did not affect expression of these transcription factors (27).
Treatment of Panc-1 cells with solvent (DMSO), 50 Amol/L
ampiroxicam, or 50 Amol/L tolfenamic acid resulted in decreased
expression of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, and VEGFR1 proteins as determined by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Replicate (3) experiments showed
that only tolfenamic acid significantly decreased Sp proteins and
VEGFR1 in Panc-1 cells (Fig. 2B), whereas ampiroxicam did not
affect expression of these proteins. A parallel experiment was also
carried out in the highly metastatic L3.6pl pancreatic cancer cell
line, which also expresses Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 (27). The results show
that 50 Amol/L tolfenamic acid but not DMSO or 50 Amol/L
ampiroxicam significantly decreased levels of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, and
VEGFR1 proteins in L3.6pl cells (Fig. 2C and D).
Confirmation that tolfenamic acid decreased VEGFR1 expression
in Panc-1 and L3.6pl cells was determined by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 3). In Panc-1 cells, VEGFR1 immunostaining was

observed in cells treated with DMSO or ampiroxicam, whereas
tolfenamic acid decreased VEGFR1 staining. VEGFR1 expression
was lower in L3.6pl cells; however, the pattern of treatment-related
effects were comparable in both Panc-1 and L3.6pl cells.
The proximal region of the VEGFR1 promoter contains GC-rich
and Egr-1 sites (26), and the effects of tolfenamic acid on VEGFR1
expression through degradation of Sp proteins cannot exclude a
role for Egr-1 in this response. Figure 4A and B compare the gel
mobility shift and antibody supershift patterns of nuclear extracts
from Panc-1 cells bound to the proximal region of the VEGFR1
promoter containing both GC-rich and Egr-1 sites (VEGFR132P)
or GC-rich sites alone (GC/Sp32P). Extracts from cells treated with
DMSO, ampiroxicam, and tolfenamic acid gave similar Sp1, Sp3,
and Sp4-DNA retarded bands using both radiolabeled oligonucleotides (Fig. 4A and B, lanes 1–3); however, the retarded band
intensity was markedly decreased using extracts from cells treated
with tolfenamic acid. Antibodies against Sp1 (Fig. 4A and B,

Sp3 and Sp4 antibodies also induced formation of supershifted
complexes (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). These results show that the
presence or absence of the Egr-1 site did not affect Sp protein
interactions with the VEGFR1 promoter. Moreover, Western blot
analysis of whole-cell lysates from Panc-1 and L3.6pl cells after
treatment with DMSO, ampiroxicam, or tolfenamic acid showed
that only the latter compound decreased VEGFR1 protein levels,
whereas Egr-1 protein was unchanged in all treatment groups
(Fig. 4C and D).
Because Sp proteins regulate expression of VEGFR1, we further
investigated the effects of tolfenamic acid on luciferase activity in
cells transfected with pVEGFR1A, pVEGFR1B, and pVEGFR1C and

on VEGFR1 mRNA levels. Tolfenamic acid but not DMSO or
ampiroxicam decreased luciferase activity in Panc-1 cells transfected with pVEGFR1A, pVEGFR1B, and pVEGFR1C (Fig. 5A–C),
and tolfenamic acid also decreased VEGFR1 mRNA levels in Panc-1
and L3.6pl cells (Fig. 5D).
Previous studies have reported that activation of VEGFR1 by
VEGFB in pancreatic cancer cells results in enhanced phosphorylation of MAPK and increased cell migration and invasion (23).
We therefore investigated the role of Sp proteins in mediating
these responses by determining the effects of tolfenamic acid on
activation of MAPK by VEGFB. Figure 6A and B shows that, after
treatment of Panc-1 and L3.6pl cells, respectively, with VEGFB for 5
or 10 min, there was increased phosphorylation of MAPK1/2 in

cells pretreated with DMSO or 50 Amol/L ampiroxicam for 36 h,
and VEGFR1 and total MAPK1/2 levels were unchanged. In
contrast, pretreatment with 50 Amol/L tolfenamic acid decreased
VEGFR1 expression and this was paralleled by decreased
phosphorylated MAPK1/2, whereas total MAPK protein levels were
not affected. Thus, inhibition of VEGFB/VEGFR1 signaling by
tolfenamic acid was related to decreased VEGFR1 through
degradation of Sp proteins and this inhibitory response was
similar to that observed in a previous study using neutralizing
VEGFR1 antibodies (23). The importance of Sp proteins in
VEGFR1-dependent Panc-1 cell migration was determined using
a cell migration assay on collagen IV–coated plates. The results
show that VEGFB induces Panc-1 cell migration in all treatment
groups (Fig. 6C); however, in cells treated with DMSO (set at 100%),
50 Amol/L ampiroxicam, or 50 Amol/L tolfenamic acid, cell
migration, which was observed in the absence of VEGFB, was
only significantly inhibited by tolfenamic acid (Fig. 6C). VEGFB
enhanced cell migration in this assay and, in cells cotreated with
VEGFB plus tolfenamic acid, the latter compound significantly
inhibited VEGFB-induced cell migration. Previous studies using an
orthotopic model for pancreatic cancer (using L3.6pl cells) showed
that tolfenamic acid (50 mg/kg) but not gemcitabine decreased Sp
proteins, tumor growth, and angiogenesis (27), and tumor tissue
from these animals was also stained for VEGFR1 (Fig. 6D). The
results show decreased VEGFR1 expression only in tumors from
tolfenamic acid-treated mice. These results show that Sp proteins

regulate VEGFR1-mediated responses, including cell migration in
pancreatic cancer cells, indicating that agents, such as tolfenamic
acid that target Sp proteins ( for degradation), are an important
new class of mechanism-based antiangiogenic compounds that
decrease Sp-dependent expression of VEGF, VEGFR2, and VEGFR1.

Discussion
VEGF and related angiogenic growth factors and their
receptors play a critical role in tumorigenesis and contribute
significantly to cancer cell progression and metastasis (1, 4–6).
Not surprisingly, VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathways have been
extensively targeted for cancer chemotherapy. Antiangiogenic
compounds initially discovered in the Folkman laboratory have
multiple mechanisms of action (4, 6); however, several alternative
approaches have also been reported and these include antibodies
that block VEGF and/or VEGFR (39–43) and tyrosine kinase
inhibitors that block VEGFR kinase signaling (44, 45). Other
approaches include development of arginine-rich peptides that
block VEGF action (46) or by blocking downstream factors, such
as Src family kinases that mediate some of the VEGFR1dependent responses in colon cancer cells (47). A construct
expressing domains of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 that tightly
binds VEGF through the extracellular domain of VEGFR1 (VEGFTrap) has also been used to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis
in animal models (48).

Sp Proteins Regulate VEGFR1 Expression

Previous studies have shown that expression of both VEGF and
VEGFR2 in pancreatic and other cancer cell lines was regulated by
Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, and RNA interference with small inhibitory
RNAs targeting these proteins decreased VEGF and VEGFR2
expression (30, 38). We also reported recently that, in pancreatic
cancer cells and tumors, the NSAID tolfenamic acid induced
proteasome-dependent degradation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, and not
surprisingly, tolfenamic acid inhibited angiogenesis and decreased
liver metastasis in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer using
the highly metastatic L3.6pl cells (27). Because VEGFR1 also plays a
pivotal role in pancreatic tumor migration and invasion (23, 25), we
investigated the molecular mechanism of VEGFR1 regulation in
pancreatic cancer cells. Takeda et al. (26) identified VEGFR1 as a
gene regulated by the basic helix-loop-helix endothelial PAS
domain protein 1, which forms a heterodimer with hypoxiainducible factor 1B to activate VEGFR1 and other proangiogenic
genes. However, the VEGFR1 gene has three consensus GC-rich
motifs that bind Sp proteins, and results from RNA interference
studies show that knockdown of Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4 also decreased
VEGFR1 protein expression in pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 1).
Moreover, similar results were observed using a series of deletion
constructs containing VEGFR1 promoter inserts (Fig. 1).
These results suggest that, like VEGF and VEGFR2 (30, 38),
VEGFR1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells is Sp dependent;
therefore, compounds, such as tolfenamic acid, which decrease
Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 (Fig. 3), should also decrease VEGFR1. This was
confirmed in a series of experiments showing that tolfenamic acid
but not the NSAID ampiroxicam (a negative control; ref. 27)
decreases VEGFR1 protein (Figs. 2A and C, 3, and 4) and mRNA
(Fig. 5D) as well as luciferase activity in cells transfected with
VEGFR1 constructs (Fig. 5A and B). Moreover, decreased VEGFR1
expression (Fig. 6D) was observed in pancreatic tumors from
mice treated with tolfenamic acid and this was accompanied by
decreased levels of VEGF and Sp protein in these tumors (27).
Because VEGFR1 mediates VEGFB-induced migration and invasion of pancreatic and colon cancer cells (23–25), we also
investigated the role of Sp proteins in mediating Panc-1 cell
migration in a ‘‘scratch’’ test in monolayer cultures grown on
collagen IV–coated plates (Fig. 6C). Previous reports show that
VEGFA and VEGFB induce migration of colon and pancreatic
cancer cells using a Boyden chamber assay (23–25), and results in
Fig. 6C confirm that VEGFB also induced migration of Panc-1
cells. Inhibition of VEGFB-induced migration of colon and
pancreatic cancer cells was observed in cells treated with the
VEGFR1 antibody (18F1; refs. 23–25), and similar inhibitory
effects were observed in this study in Panc-1 cells cotreated with

VEGFB plus tolfenamic acid (Fig. 6C). In contrast, tolfenamic acid
also inhibited Panc-1 cell migration in solvent-treated (DMSO)
cells, whereas the VEGFR1 antibody did not affect migration of
untreated/solvent control cells. The differences between tolfenamic acid and VEGFR1 antibodies must be due to the overall
decrease in VEGFR1 levels (Fig. 2) in cells treated with tolfenamic
acid, whereas the antibodies do not affect VEGFR1 expression. We
also examined VEGFB-induced phosphorylation of MAPK in
Panc-1 and L3.6pl cells and, like the VEGFR1 antibody (23),
tolfenamic acid decreased MAPK phosphorylation in Panc-1 and
L3.6pl cells (Fig. 6A and B). This was consistent with the parallel
down-regulation of VEGFR1 protein in these cells. Thus, the
inhibition of VEGFB-induced migration of pancreatic cancer cells
by tolfenamic acid is also accompanied by inhibition of VEGFR1dependent downstream signaling. Ampiroxicam, a NSAID that
does not induce Sp protein degradation in Panc-1 cells, was also
used as a control in the cell migration and MAPK phosphorylation studies, and this compound was inactive in all assays.
In summary, results of this study show that, like VEGF and
VEGFR2, VEGFR1 is also regulated by Sp proteins in pancreatic
cancer cells. Although extensive studies have not been carried out
on Sp protein expression in tumors, there is evidence that Sp1 is
overexpressed in cancer cells and tumors (16, 35, 49–52), and this
is also consistent with the up-regulation of angiogenic factor
expression in many cancers. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)
inhibitors have also shown promise as anticancer agents and
these compounds also decrease Sp1 and Sp4 but not Sp3 protein
expression in colon and pancreatic cancer cells (27, 31). Because
the use of Cox-2 inhibitors has now been limited, selective
NSAIDs, such as tolfenamic acid, may be preferable for
applications in cancer chemotherapy. Results of this study on
VEGFR1 coupled with previous reports showing that Sp proteins
also regulate expression of VEGF and VEGFR2 (30, 38) suggest
that compounds, such as tolfenamic acid that target Sp
transcription factor degradation, represent an important class
of antiangiogenic drugs for treatment of pancreatic and other
cancers where Sp proteins play a role in cell growth and
angiogenesis.
