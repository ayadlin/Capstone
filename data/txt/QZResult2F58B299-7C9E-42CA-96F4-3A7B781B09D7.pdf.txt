Abstract
The Yes-associated protein, YAP, is a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway of cell-cycle control that
plays important roles in tumorigenesis. Hippo-mediated phosphorylation YAP, mainly at S127, inactivates
YAP function. In this study, we deﬁne a mechanism for positive regulation of YAP activity that is critical for its
oncogenic function. Speciﬁcally, we found that YAP is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by the cell-cycle
kinase CDK1 at T119, S289, and S367 during the G2–M phase of the cell cycle. We also found that ectopic
expression of a phosphomimetic YAP mutant (YAP3D, harboring T119D/S289D/S367D) was sufﬁcient to
induce mitotic defects in immortalized epithelial cells, including centrosome ampliﬁcation, multipolar
spindles, and chromosome missegregation. Finally, we documented that mitotic phosphorylation of YAP was
sufﬁcient to promote cell migration and invasion in a manner essential for neoplastic cell transformation. In
support of our ﬁndings, CDK1 inhibitors largely suppressed cell motility mediated by activated YAP-S127A
but not the phosphomimetic mutant YAP3D. Collectively, our results reveal a previously unrecognized
mechanism for controlling the activity of YAP that is crucial for its oncogenic function mediated by mitotic
dysregulation. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6722–33. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Studies from Drosophila have deﬁned the Hippo signaling
pathway (1). Genetically engineered mouse models demonstrated that the Hippo pathway is highly conserved in mammals and controls organ size, tumorigenesis, cell contact
inhibition, and stem cell self-renewal by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis (2–4). The core of the Hippo pathway
is a kinase cascade including the tumor suppressors Mst1/2
(Hippo in Drosophila), Lats1/2 (Warts in Drosophila), and the
oncoproteins Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional
coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ; Yorkie in Drosophila). Mst1/2, in complexes with WW45 (Salvador in Drosophila), phosphorylates and activates Lats1/2. Activated Lats1/2
(together with Mob1) phosphorylates and inactivates the
transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ. The transcription factors TEAD1-4 (Scalloped in Drosophila) are the main mediators
for YAP's oncogenic function (5, 6). Recent work has identiﬁed
lysophosphatidic acid, sphingosine-1-phosphate as ligands,
and G-protein–coupled receptors as receptors for the Hippo

pathway (7–9). YAP is phosphorylated at S127 and S381 by
Lats1/2 kinases and inactivated by cytoplasmic sequestration
and ubiquitination-dependent degradation (10–13).
YAP promotes tumorigenesis in several types of cancers,
including hepatocellular carcinoma (13) and skin cancer (14).
It is not surprising that YAP is ampliﬁed or overexpressed/
hyperactivated in many types of human cancers (13, 15).
Accordingly, genetic ablation of upstream tumor suppressors
(e.g., Mst1/2, WW45, and Mob1a/1b) in mice also leads to the
formation of many types of tumors including hepatocellular
carcinoma (16–20).
Although extensive studies have demonstrated the important roles for the Hippo pathway in tumorigenesis, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Interestingly, recent studies
demonstrated that several key members of the Hippo pathway,
such as Mst1/2, Lats1/2, WW45, and Mob1, are involved in
regulating mitosis (21). Aberration of mitosis often causes
genome instability/aneuploidy and subsequent tumor formation. Thus, the Hippo pathway may contribute to cancer
development by regulating mitosis-related events.
We recently reported that KIBRA (an upstream regulator
of the Hippo pathway) is required for chromosome alignment and proper microtubule organization during mitosis
(22). Furthermore, KIBRA is phosphorylated by mitotic
kinases Aurora and CDK1 during mitosis (23, 24). These
studies prompted us to examine whether YAP, the most
critical growth mediator of the Hippo pathway, is regulated
during mitosis. We show that YAP is also hyperphosphorylated during the G2–M phase. We further characterized the
phosphorylation sites, the corresponding kinase, and the
functional signiﬁcance of the phosphorylation. Our data
reveal a new layer of regulation for YAP activity, implicating

that YAP exerts its oncogenic function through dysregulation of mitosis.

Materials and Methods
Expression constructs
YAP-S381A, YAP with mutations in the WW domains, and
YAP-5SA plasmids were purchased from Addgene. pcDNA-YAP
(no tag) expression constructs have been described (13). To
make HA-tagged human YAP, full-length YAP cDNA (IMAGE
clone 5747370, contains two WW domains and 504 amino
acids) was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1þHA vector (25). To
make the retroviral-mediated YAP expression construct, the
above cDNA was cloned into MaRXIV vector (25). Point
mutations were generated by the QuickChange Site-Directed
PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and veriﬁed by sequencing.
Cell culture and transfection
HEK293T, HeLa, MCF-7, and MCF10A cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The
cell lines were authenticated at ATCC and were used at low
(<20) passages. MCF-10A cells were cultured as described (10).
H2229, H1277, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and HCT-116 cell lines
were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. Attractene and HiPerFect (Qiagen) were used for transient overexpression and
siRNA transfections, respectively, following the manufacturer's
instructions. Nocodazole (100 ng/mL for 16–20 hours) and
Taxol (0.1 mmol/L for 16 hours) were used to arrest cells in the
G2–M phase unless otherwise indicated. Etoposide and doxorubicin were also from Sigma. YAP siRNA was synthesized by
GenePharma based on the following target sequence (YAP-1:
50 -CAGGTGATACTATCAACCAAA-30 ; YAP-2: 50 -GACCAATAGCTCAGATCCTTT (selected by Invitrogen online software). All other chemicals were either from Sigma or Thermo
Fisher.
Kinase inhibitors
VX680 (Aurora-A, -B, -C inhibitor), ZM447439 (Aurora-B, -C
inhibitor), and BI2536 (Plk1 inhibitor) were obtained from
Selleck Chemicals. U0126 [MAP–ERK kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal—regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor], SB203580 (p38
inhibitor), LY294002 (PI-3K inhibitor), rapamycin (mTOR
inhibitor), and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) were from LC Laboratories. RO-3306 (CDK1 inhibitor) and roscovitine (CDKs
inhibitor) were from ENZO Life Sciences. MK5108 (Aurora-A
inhibitor) was from Merck. SB216763 (GSK3b inhibitor) and
anisomycin (JNK activator) were from Sigma.
Recombinant protein puriﬁcation
The glutathione S-transferase (GST)–tagged proteins were
bacterially expressed and puriﬁed on GSTrap FF afﬁnity columns (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions. To make His-tagged human YAP, full-length YAP cDNA
was subcloned into the pET-21c vector (Novagen/EMD Chemicals). The proteins were expressed and puriﬁed on HisPur
Cobalt spin columns (Pierce) following the manufacturer's
instructions.

Identiﬁcation of phosphorylation sites by mass
spectrometry
Endogenous YAP from HeLa cells treated with Taxol was
immunoprecipitated and stained with Coomassie blue. The
upshifted YAP bands were sliced and in-gel digested as
described (26). Nano LC-MS/MS (nanoscale liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry) was performed with an in-house built nanoLC system (27) coupled
with an LTQ (linear ion trap)-Velos mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Survey full scan MS spectra (from m/z
375 to 1,700) were acquired in the LTQ-Velos with a resolution
of 6,000. The 20 most intense ions (depending on signal
intensity) were sequentially isolated for fragmentation in the
linear ion trap by collision-induced dissociation. The capillary
was maintained at 200 C, and the spray voltage was kept at
2.3 kV. DeconMSn was used to determine and reﬁne the
monoisotopic mass and charge state of parent ions from the
LTQ-Velos raw data, and to create a peak list of these ions
in .mgf format. The .mgf ﬁles were searched against the human
international protein index (IPI) protein sequence database
(Version 3.52), which contained the normal IPI human proteins, commonly observed contaminants, and the reverse
sequences of all proteins with the OMSSA search engine
(version 2.1.9; National Center for Biotechnology Information;
ref. 28). In the database search, carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as the ﬁxed modiﬁcation. Oxidation of methionine, and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine
were set as the variable modiﬁcations. The precursor tolerance
was set as 1.5 Da and MS2 tolerance was 0.5 Da. The E value
cutoff was set at 0.1. The false discovery rate was made 1% by
ﬁltering on the E-value of all forward and reversed peptide
identiﬁcations. The spectra were manually checked.
In vitro kinase assay
1–2 mg of His-YAP was incubated with 10 U recombinant
CDK1/cyclin B complex (New England Biolabs) or 100 ng
CDK1/cyclin B (SignalChem) or HeLa cell total lysates (treated
with DMSO or Taxol) in kinase buffer (23) in the presence
of 5 mCi g-32P-ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer). MEK1,
ERK1, and p38a active kinases were purchased from SignalChem. Myelin basic protein (Sigma) was used for positive
control. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred
onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (Millipore), and visualized
by autoradiography followed by Western blotting or detected
by phospho-speciﬁc antibodies.
Antibodies
The YAP antibodies from Abnova (H00010413-M01) and
Abcam (52771) were used for immunoprecipitation of
endogenous YAP and for Western blotting, respectively,
throughout the study. Rabbit polyclonal phospho-speciﬁc
antibodies against YAP S367, S289, and T119 were generated
and puriﬁed by AbMart. HA antibodies were from Sigma.
Anti-b-actin, anti-ERK1/2, and anti-cyclin B antibodies were
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Aurora-A, anti-GST,
anti-His, anti-Mst1, anti-Mst2, anti-Lats1, and anti-Lats2
antibodies were from Bethyl Laboratories. Anti-phosphoAurora-A,B,C, anti-phospho-S10 H3, anti-phospho-T202/

and anti-phospho-T210 Plk1 antibodies were obtained from
Biolegend. Anti-a-tubulin (Abcam), anti-b-tubulin (Sigma),
and anti-g-tubulin (Biolegend) antibodies were used for
immunoﬂuorescence staining.
Immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, and
lambda phosphatase treatment
Immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and lambda phosphatase treatment assays were done as previously described
(23).
Immunoﬂuorescence staining and confocal microscopy
Cell ﬁxation, permeabilization, ﬂuorescence staining, and
microscopy were done as previously described (22). For peptide
blocking, a protocol from Abcam website was used. Brieﬂy, the
phospho-YAP antibodies were ﬁrst neutralized by an excess of
immunizing (phosphorylated) peptides (1 mg/mL for 1 hour at
room temperature). The antibody (containing the phosphopeptide) was then used for staining in parallel with staining using
antibodies with no peptide or nonphosphopeptide.
Colony formation, cell migration, and invasion assays
Colony formation assays in soft agar were performed as
described (13). In vitro analysis of invasion and migration was
assessed using the BioCoat invasion system (BD Biosciences)
and Transwell system (Corning), respectively, according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The invasive and migratory cells
were stained with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with 40 ,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The relative invading and
migrating rates were calculated by the number of cells invading
and migrating through the membrane divided by the number
of cells that invaded and migrated in the control group.
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was performed using a two-tailed,
unpaired Student t test.

Results
YAP is phosphorylated during antimitotic drug-induced
G2–M arrest
To further explore whether other members of the Hippo
pathway are regulated during mitosis, we treated HeLa cells
with Taxol or nocodazole (both agents arrest cells in G2–M)
and systematically examined the responses of the Hippo
pathway during G2–M arrest. As shown in Fig. 1A, the most
prominent change we observed was the dramatic mobility
upshift of YAP and, to a lesser extent, of TAZ. The phosphorylation level of YAP at S127 (the major phosphorylation site
regulated by the Hippo pathway) was not altered, suggesting
that the mobility shift of YAP was not likely due to the
phosphorylation at S127. Taxol or nocodazole treatment did
not cause any evident change in the expression levels for NF2,

Mst1/2, WW45, Mob1, or in the activity of Mst1/2 and Lats1/2
revealed by phospho antibodies (Fig. 1A). Consistent with
previous reports, we detected a mobility upshift of Lats1 (due
to mitotic phosphorylation; refs. 29, 30) and a signiﬁcant
increase of Lats2 expression (31) during Taxol or nocodazole
treatment (Fig. 1A). The mobility upshift of YAP was also
evident in breast (MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231), colon
(HCT-116), and lung (H1299 and H2227) cancer cell lines
during Taxol-arrested mitosis (Fig. 1B). The shift was detectable as early as 4 hours after 100-nmol/L Taxol treatment, and
only 10 nmol/L of Taxol (for a 16-hour treatment) was sufﬁcient to induce the shift in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). Taken together,
YAP mobility is signiﬁcantly retarded during antimitotic druginduced G2–M arrest.
YAP is a phosphoprotein whose mobility is retarded on
SDS-polyacrylamide gels when phosphorylated (10, 13). Lambda phosphatase treatment completely converted all slowmigrating bands to fast-migrating bands, indicating that the
mobility shift of YAP during G2–M is caused by phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). To further test whether YAP phosphorylation is
speciﬁc to mitosis, we collected mitotic cells by mechanical
shake-off from Taxol-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, mitotic
cells expressed exclusively phosphorylated YAP, while YAP is
not phosphorylated/shifted in attached nonmitotic cells, suggesting that YAP phosphorylation is speciﬁcally associated
with G2–M cell-cycle arrest.
Previous reports showed that YAP was phosphorylated by
c-Abl, p38, and JNK kinases in response to the DNA damage
(32–34). We further explored whether DNA-damaging agents
can cause such a mobility shift of YAP. As shown in Fig. 2B,
in contrast to YAP shift during mitosis, treatment with doxorubicin, etoposide, UV, or ionizing radiation (IR) failed to
cause any obvious change on the YAP mobility. Increased
activity of Chk1 revealed by phospho-S345 antibody indicated
that these treatments were effective. These data further suggest that the mobility shift/phosphorylation of YAP is a speciﬁc response during cell cycle G2–M.
Identiﬁcation of the corresponding kinase(s) for YAP
phosphorylation
Upon treatment of antimitotic agents, several mitotic
kinases, including Aurora and Plk1, are activated during
mitosis (35). Inhibitors for these kinases are widely used.
Inhibition of Aurora-A (with MK5108), or Aurora-B, C (with
ZM447439), or Aurora-A, B, C (with VX-680) kinases did not
alter the YAP phosphorylation. The treatments with these
inhibitors were effective, as revealed by the phospho-Aurora
antibody (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Addition of BI2536 (an
inhibitor of Plk1 kinase) did not reverse the YAP mobility
shift/phosphorylation either (Supplementary Fig. S1B). It
has been reported that MEK-ERK signaling is also activated
during Taxol treatment (36). However, in our hands, MEKERK activity was strongly inhibited upon treatment with
Taxol (Supplementary Fig. S1C; refs. 24, 37). Thus MEK-ERK
kinases are not likely the kinases responsible for YAP phosphorylation under antimitotic drug-induced mitosis, and
treatment with U0126 (an inhibitor for MEK-ERK kinases)
did not affect the YAP phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig.

S1C). In addition, inhibition of PI-3K (with LY294002), mTOR
(with rapamycin), MAPK-p38 (with SB203580), and GSK-3b
(with SB216763) did not affect the phosphorylation of YAP
induced by Taxol treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
CDK1 is a master regulator of cell cycle and is activated
during normal and drug-arrested G2–M (35, 38). JNK1/2
kinases are also activated upon Taxol treatment (Fig. 2C,
revealed by increased p-c-Jun levels). We tested whether CDK1
and/or JNK1/2 kinases are responsible for YAP phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2C (left panel), both RO3306 (a CDK1
inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK1/2 inhibitor) completely
reverted the mobility shift of YAP. These drugs are known to
induce mitotic exit as shown by the complete loss of phosphoAurora and degradation of cyclin B. We treated the cells with
MG132 along with RO3306 or SP600125 to prevent cyclin B
degradation and cells exiting from mitosis. Under these conditions, RO3306, but not SP600125, was still able to completely
inhibit YAP phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). In the presence of

Mitotic Phosphorylation Regulates YAP Activity

RO3306, YAP was no longer phosphorylated even when
JNK1/2 kinases were strongly activated (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and
7), suggesting that CDK1, but not JNK1/2 kinases, is likely to be
responsible for YAP phosphorylation. Furthermore, another
CDK1 inhibitor (roscovitine) also completely inhibited YAP
phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data strongly
suggest that YAP phosphorylation induced by Taxol treatment
is CDK1 dependent and is independent of JNK1/2 kinases.
CDK1 phosphorylates YAP in vitro
To determine whether CDK1 kinase can directly phosphorylate YAP, we performed in vitro kinase assays with His-tagged
YAP as substrates. Figure 2E shows that Taxol-treated mitotic
lysates robustly phosphorylated YAP and that CDK1 depletion
greatly reduced phosphorylation of His-YAP (top row, compare
lane 4 with lane 3). As expected, puriﬁed CDK1/cyclin B
complex phosphorylated His-YAP in vitro (Fig. 2F). These
results indicate that CDK1 directly phosphorylated YAP

sites (10, 12). The rest of the three sites all ﬁt the prolinedirected consensus sequence (Fig. 3A) of CDK1-phosphorylation sites (39). Interestingly, all these three sites have been
identiﬁed as mitotic phosphorylation sites from large-scale
proteomic studies (40, 41).

Figure 3. CDK1 phosphorylates YAP at T119 and S289 in vitro and in cells. A, HeLa cells were treated with Taxol. YAP was immunoprecipitated,
electrophoresed, excised, and subjected to mass spectrometry for phosphorylation site mapping (see Materials and Methods). Three phosphopeptides and
the phospho sites are shown. B, HeLa cells were transfected with YAP and various nonphosphorylatable mutants. Cells were treated with Taxol at 24 hours
posttransfection. Total cell lysates were probed with the indicated antibodies. C, in vitro kinase assays were done as in Fig. 2F except anti-phospho-YAP T119,
S289, and S367 antibodies were used. D, HeLa (upper part) or HEK293T (lower part) cells were transfected with HA-YAP or HA-YAP mutants. At 30 hours
posttransfection, the cells were treated with Taxol for 16 hours. The immunoprecipitates (with HA antibodies) were probed with anti-phospho-YAP
and subsequent anti-HA antibodies. SE, short exposure; LE, long exposure. E, HeLa cells were treated with Taxol and endogenous YAP was
immunoprecipitated and probed with the indicated antibodies. Total cell lysates before immunoprecipitation were also included. F, HeLa cells were
treated with Taxol for 16 hours and RO3306 (5 mmol/L) or roscovitine (Rosco, 10 mmol/L) was added to cells 2 hours before harvesting as indicated.
Proteasome inhibitor MG132 was also added (together with inhibitors) to prevent cyclin B from degradation and cells from exiting from mitosis. The cells
were treated with l phosphatase (ppase) as needed. Total cell lysates before immunoprecipitation were also analyzed.

Taxol (Fig. 3B, compare lane 8 with lane 2). No further decrease
on YAP mobility was observed when T119 and S289, or S289

double mutation of T119A and S367A or triple mutation of all
three sites largely abolished the mobility shift of YAP, suggesting that T119 and S367 are the main sites responsible for
mobility shift of YAP upon Taxol treatment (Fig. 3B).
For comparison, we also tested whether some other known
phosphorylation or binding sites are involved in the YAP
mobility shift induced by Taxol treatment. Mutating the Hippo

phosphorylation sites (S127, S381, and 5SA: S381A/S164A/
S127A/S109A/S61A; refs. 10, 12, 13) or TEAD binding site
(S94; ref. 5) or the c-Abl phosphorylation site (Y407; ref. 33)
did not affect the YAP shift induced by Taxol in HEK293T
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D). The WW domain mutations
(W199A/P202A and/or W258/P261A) did not affect the Taxolinduced YAP shift either (data not shown). Together, our data
identiﬁed novel phosphorylation of YAP during Taxol-arrested
G2–M.
CDK1/cyclin B complex phosphorylates YAP at T119 and
S289 in vitro and in cells
We have generated phospho-speciﬁc antibodies against
T119, S289, and S367. Using these antibodies, we demonstrated
that CDK1 robustly phosphorylated YAP at T119, S289 and at
S367 as well in vitro (Fig. 3C). Addition of RO3306 abolished the
phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). To explore whether T119 and S289
are also phosphorylated within cells during Taxol-induced
G2–M arrest, we transfected YAP or corresponding nonphosphorylatable mutants into cells, treated the cells with Taxol,
and determined levels of phosphorylation by phospho antibodies. Taxol treatment signiﬁcantly increased the phosphorylation of T119 and S289, and the signal was abolished by
mutating T119 or S289 to alanine (Fig. 3D). Taxol treatment
also signiﬁcantly increased the phosphorylation of T119 and
S289 in immunoprecipitated endogenous YAP (Fig. 3E). As
expected, no signal was detected in control (IgG) immunoprecipitates, suggesting that these antibodies speciﬁcally recognize phosphorylated YAP. Lambda phosphatase treatment
completely abolished the signal, further conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of the phospho-speciﬁc antibodies (Fig. 3F). Using
inhibitors for CDK1 kinase, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of YAP T119 and S289 is CDK1 kinase dependent (Fig.
3F). Taken together, these results indicate that YAP is phosphorylated at T119 and S289 in cells during antimitotic druginduced G2–M arrest in a CDK1-dependent manner.
Phosphorylation of YAP occurs in cells during normal
mitosis
To determine whether mitotic phosphorylation of YAP
occurs during unperturbed/normal mitosis, we collected samples from a double thymidine block and release (22) and
determined the phospho levels of YAP during different cellcycle phases. Figure 4A shows that phosphorylated YAP was
readily detected in cells 8–10 hours after being released from
double thymidine block, which is coincident with increased
levels of cyclin B and phospho-H3 S10 (both of which are
mitotic markers). The signal was diminished when cells exit
mitosis (Fig. 4A, lane 4). These data strongly suggest that YAP is
phosphorylated at T119 and S289 during normal mitosis.
To further investigate the dynamics of YAP phosphorylation
in cells, we performed immunoﬂuoresence microscopy with
these phospho-speciﬁc antibodies. A strong signal was
detected in nocodazole-arrested prometaphase cells for both
antibodies against S289 and T119 (Supplementary Fig. S3A and
S3B, top, red arrows). Very low or no signal was detected in
interphase cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B, yellow
arrows). Importantly, phosphopeptide, but not nonphospho-

6728

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

peptide incubation completely blocked the signal, suggesting
that these antibodies speciﬁcally detect phosphorylated YAP
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B, bottom). The speciﬁcity of
the antibodies was further conﬁrmed by siRNA knockdown of
YAP (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D). We found that the pYAP-S289 signal was clearly increased in prophase and peaked
in prometaphase/metaphase. The signal was then weakened
during metaphase to anaphase transition and further diminished in telophase and cytokinesis (Fig. 4B). Similar staining
patterns were generated with p-YAP-T119 antibody staining
(Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S4). These data further demonstrate that mitotic phosphorylation of YAP occurs dynamically
in cells. Addition of RO3306 or roscovitine largely abolished the
signals detected by p-YAP S289 and T119 antibodies in mitotic
cells, further indicating that the phosphorylation is CDK1
dependent (Fig. 4D).
Phosphomimetic YAP induces mitotic abnormalities in
immortalized cells
Some of the Hippo components regulate mitotic events
including chromosome alignment, centrosome duplication,
and microtubule dynamics (21). We next examined whether
YAP or its phosphorylation is able to trigger mitotic defects.
The immortalized epithelial cell line MCF10A, stably expressing vector, YAP, and YAP3D (a phosphomimetic mutant),
were used for this purpose (Fig. 5A). As expected, immunoﬂuoresence staining with a-tubulin and g-tubulin showed
normal microtubule/spindle formation and centrosome number during mitosis in control cells (Fig. 5B). Overexpression of
wild-type YAP is not sufﬁcient to cause signiﬁcant mitotic
defects in MCF10A cells (Fig. 5D–F). In contrast, mitotic
abnormalities were detected in a signiﬁcant higher percentage
of cells expressing YAP3D (3–4-fold). There is a threefold
increase of number of YAP3D-expressing cells with disorganization of microtubules and formation of multipolar spindles
when compared with control cells (Fig. 5B and D). We also
found the percentage of cells with more than two centrosomes
(g-tubulin staining) signiﬁcantly increased in YAP3D-expressing cells (Fig. 5B and E). As expected, massive chromosome
misalignment, chromosome lagging, and chromosome missegregation were observed in about 25% of YAP3D-expressing
cells (Fig. 5B, C, and F). These data suggest that ectopic
expression of phosphomimetic YAP, but not wild-type YAP,
is sufﬁcient to trigger mitotic abnormalities in immortalized
epithelial cells.
Mitotic phosphorylation of YAP is required for cellular
transformation
Overexpression of YAP transforms MCF10A cells (15). We
further examined the biologic signiﬁcance of mitotic phosphorylation of YAP using these cell lines stably expressing YAP
or YAP mutants (Fig. 6A). MCF10A cells expressing YAP-S127A
formed colonies in soft agar, however, MCF10A-YAP4A
(S127A/T119A/S289A/S367A) cells failed to produce any obvious colonies (Fig. 6B and C). YAP3D overexpression is not
sufﬁcient to stimulate anchorage-independent growth in soft
agar (data not shown). YAP or YAP-3A (T119A/S289A/S367A)
overexpression failed to produce colonies in soft agar (Fig. 6B

and data not shown). Together, these data strongly suggest
that mitotic phosphorylation is required for YAP-mediated
cellular transformation in MCF10A cells.
Mitotic phosphorylation of YAP promotes cell migration
and invasion
Recent reports showed that YAP/YAP-S127A also promotes
migration and invasion in vitro (42) and metastasis in vivo (43).
Interestingly, centrosome ampliﬁcation has been correlated
with cancer invasiveness and enhances migration and invasion
of malignant cells via the modulation of microtubule cytoskeleton (44). We, therefore, tested whether mitotic phosphorylation of YAP is involved in cell motility. As expected, ectopic
expression of YAP and YAP-S127A increased migration
(Fig. 6D) and invasion (Fig. 6E) of MCF10A cells. Mutating
CDK1-mediated phosphorylation sites to alanine (YAP-4A)
dramatically suppressed YAP-S127A-mediated migration
(Fig. 6D) and invasion (Fig. 6E). Interestingly, cells expressing
YAP3D possess much higher migration and invasion activity

than cells expressing wild-type YAP (Fig. 6D and E). These
data suggest that mitotic phosphorylation of YAP promotes
cell motility in immortalized epithelial cells.
The above observations indicate that elimination of phosphorylation of YAP by CDK1 inhibitors reduces YAP-, but not
YAP3D-mediated cell motility. Indeed, addition of RO3306
almost completely suppressed YAP-S127A-driven migration
(Fig. 6F) and invasion (Fig. 6G). Importantly, YAP3D-mediated
migration and invasion was not affected by the presence of
RO3306 (Fig. 6F and G). Collectively, these data strongly
indicate that YAP promotes migration and invasion in a
CDK1-phosphorylation dependent manner.

Discussion
Although the role of the Hippo pathway in tumorigenesis has
been ﬁrmly demonstrated in several types of cancers, the
underlying mechanisms are less clear. Recent reports support
the notion that Hippo pathway plays critical roles in maintaining

normal mitosis and that inactivation of key members of the
Hippo pathway (including Lats2, Mst1/2, Mob1, WW45) leads to
mitotic defects in multiple processes including centrosome
maturation and disjunction, chromosome alignment, and cytokinesis (19, 45, 46). Mitotic aberrations cause aneuploidy or
chromosome instability (47), which is often associated with
tumorigenesis (48). The current study identiﬁed novel phosphorylation of YAP during mitosis and the mitotic phosphorylation controls YAP's oncogenic activity. Importantly, YAP-3D
(a phosphorylation mimetic mutant), but not wild-type YAP,
drives mitotic defects (Fig. 5). Thus, our data suggest that there
may be a positive layer of regulation for YAP activity during
tumorigenesis, and highlight a previously unrevealed mechanism through which YAP exerts its oncogenic function (Fig. 6H).
Interestingly, increased CDK1 activity also promotes defects in
various mitosis-related processes and aneuploidy, and CDK1
overexpression is often observed in many types of cancers (49).
Therefore, it is also possible YAP is one of the critical substrates
of CDK1 that mediates CDK1-driven mitotic defects. There are
several important questions that need to be answered in the
future. For example, does CDK1 phosphorylation of YAP impact
its transcriptional activity? Does this phosphorylation affect
YAP's binding partners, including the transcription factors
TEAD1-4? Furthermore, future studies are required to address
the in vivo relevance of CDK1 phosphorylation of YAP and

whether this phosphorylation occurs in human patients with
cancer. Addressing these unanswered questions should further
strengthen the biologic signiﬁcance of CDK1 phosphorylation of
YAP.
Compelling evidence clearly indicates that supernumerary
centrosome is one of the hallmarks of cancer and has been
correlated with metastatic progression (44, 50). Cell migration
and invasion are critical processes for metastasis, which
accounts for the majority of deaths related to cancer. YAP
hyperphosphorylation induces supernumerary centrosomes
(Fig. 5) and promotes migration and invasion (Fig. 6). These
data suggest a novel mechanism in which YAP promotes
migration and invasion through centrosome ampliﬁcation in
a CDK1-phosphorylation–dependent manner. YAP plays
important roles in cancer development and metastasis in
several types of cancers and remains as an attractive target
for cancer therapy (3). We found that inhibition of CDK1
activity substantially impaired YAP-driven migration and invasion (Fig. 6F and G). Because R-roscovitine (Seliciclib) has been
in phase I clinical trials with low toxicity (51), our ﬁndings
support the feasibility of using CDK1 inhibitors in human
cancers especially for those in which the Hippo-YAP signaling
is dysregulated.
Upon treatment with antimitotic agents, one of the prominent responses of the Hippo pathway is the marked increase

in the phosphorylation of YAP (Fig. 1) and KIBRA (23).
Interestingly, the Hippo pathway core components Mst1/2
and Lats1/2 have also been shown to be regulated during
mitosis. Autophosphorylation (kinase activity) of Mst and
Lats is increased in U2OS cells upon nocodazole treatment
(52). However, we could not detect any signiﬁcant change of
Mst or Lats activity (by phospho antibodies) in HeLa and
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A and data not shown), suggesting that
the mitotic activation of Mst and Lats is cell-type speciﬁc.
Lats2 was also phosphorylated by Aurora-A at the centrosomes during mitosis (53). YAP is a direct substrate of Lats1/
2 (10, 12, 13) and KIBRA associates with Lats1/2 (25).
Interestingly, CDK1 also phosphorylates KIBRA (24) and
Lats1 (30) during mitosis, and one question is whether or
how KIBRA/Lats1/2 is involved in the regulation of mitotic
phosphorylation of YAP. Furthermore, YAP and TAZ are
paralogs and have similar and distinct functions (2, 4). We

treatment (Fig. 1A). Although all three phosphorylation sites
on YAP are conserved in vertebrates, however, surprisingly,
none of the phosphorylation sites of YAP exists on TAZ.
We are currently investigating how TAZ is regulated and
whether TAZ also plays a role in mitosis similar to YAP.
