BACKGROUND: Despite limited preclinical and clinical investigations, milk thistle (MT) is often used for the treatment of
chemotherapy-associated hepatotoxicity. Limited treatment options exist for chemotherapy-related hepatoxicity. Given
the wide use of MT, the authors investigated MT in both the laboratory and a clinical setting. METHODS: In a double-blind
study, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and hepatic toxicity were randomized to MT or placebo orally
for 28 days. Liver function tests were evaluated during the study period. To assess MT in vitro, the authors evaluated
supratherapeutic concentrations in an ALL cell line. RESULTS: Fifty children were enrolled. No significant differences in
frequency of side effects, incidence and severity of toxicities, or infections were observed between groups. There were no
significant changes in mean amino alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), or total bilirubin (TB) at
Day 28. At Day 56, the MT group had a significantly lower AST (P ¼ .05) and a trend toward a significantly lower ALT (P
¼ .07). Although not significantly different, chemotherapy doses were reduced in 61% of the MT group compared with
72% of the placebo group. In vitro experiments revealed no antagonistic interactions between MT and vincristine or L-asparaginase in CCRF-CEM cells. A modest synergistic effect with vincristine was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In children
with ALL and liver toxicity, MT was associated with a trend toward significant reductions in liver toxicity. MT did not
antagonize the effects of chemotherapy agents used for the treatment of ALL. Future study is needed to determine the
most effective dose and duration of MT and its effect on hepatotoxicity and leukemia-free survival. Cancer 2010;116:506–

During the past 2 decades, there has been an increased interest in understanding the mechanisms and clinical applications of milk thistle (Silybum marianum), an herbal plant.1-3 Prior studies have found milk thistle (MT) has both
hepatoprotectant and nephroprotectant activity, thus suggesting its application as a supportive care agent.4 MT is available in the United States as a dietary supplement and most often is used for its effects on the liver. Clinical studies have
investigated MT for the prevention or treatment of liver damage in patients with hepatitis and cirrhosis.3,5 A case report
suggested that MT plays a beneficial role for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity.6
In the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the administration of chemotherapy agents is
frequently interrupted because of liver toxicity, especially during the maintenance phase of treatment. Schmiegelow et al

Milk Thistle (Silybum Marianum) for Hepatotoxicity in Children With ALL/Ladas et al

found that children with ALL who experience a cumulative withdrawal of methotrexate or 6 mercaptopurine of
greater than 10% of the prescribed therapy have an
increased risk of bone-marrow relapse (methotrexate:
complete hematologic remission [CHR], 45%  12%
versus 78%  5%, P ¼ .009; 6 mercaptopurine: CHR
31%  12% versus 77%  5%, P < .00,001).7 Hepatotoxicity was the main reason for cumulative, long-term,
drug withdrawals. More recent investigations have
found that 66.5% of children with ALL encountered
grade 2 or higher liver toxicity at some point during
their therapy.8
Currently, there are no substitute chemotherapy
agents that provide the same effectiveness against ALL yet
preserve liver function. There are also no hepatoprotective
medications that allow chemotherapy to continue to be
administered while preserving liver function. Thus, adjunctive agents that may enable optimal doses of chemotherapy to be administered without necessitating a
decrease in the recommended doses of chemotherapy are
of clinical significance and may further improve survival
in children with ALL. We present the results from a multicenter pilot study that evaluated the safety and feasibility
of MT for the treatment of hepatotoxicity in children
with ALL who were receiving maintenance-phase
chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In Vitro Antileukemic Cytotoxicity Assay
MT (Siliphos; Thorne Research, Sandpoint, ID) is a 1:2
mixture of silibinin, the most active fraction of milk thistle, and soy phosphatidylcholine, a formulation reported
to improve the bioavailability of milk thistle.9 Silibinin is
a mixture of 2 diastereoisomeric compounds, Silybin A
and B. Silibinin was investigated for potential antagonism
of the in vitro cytotoxic effects of selected agents used in
ALL treatment regimens. CCRF-CEM T-cell ALL cells
were concurrently exposed to a dose range of either vincristine or L-asparaginase in the presence of a constant
concentration of 0, 10, or 30 lM silibinin for 72 hours.
These silibinin concentrations were chosen to represent at
least a 10-fold higher concentration than the anticipated
Cmax in the clinical trial. The described in vitro experiments followed previously described methodology.10
Mean percentage survival (þstandard error of the
mean[SD]) for each treatment group was calculated relative to the mean absorbance of vehicle-treated controls.

Clinical Trial
Eligibility

This study was approved by the institutional review
boards of all participating institutions. To meet eligibility
requirements, children with ALL were between the ages of 1
and 21 years, were in the maintenance phase of therapy, and
were treated according to the Children’s Cancer Group or
the Children’s Oncology Group,11,12 or the Dana Farber
Cancer Institute ALL Consortium protocols (Fig. 1).
During the maintenance phase of therapy, patients
are routinely evaluated for liver toxicity at the beginning
of each cycle of chemotherapy. Children were eligible for
participation when they had hepatic toxicity of grade 2 or
greater (National Cancer Institute, Common Toxicity
Criteria, Version 2.0)13 on any 1 of the following 3 tests,
amino alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), or total bilirubin (TB). Patients with extrahepatic biliary obstruction, severe hepatic and/or kidney
failure, gastrointestinal obstruction, or malabsorption
syndromes were excluded from participation.
Study design

The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Fig. 2). Upon informed consent
and assent, patients were randomly selected to receive the
study drug, milk thistle, or a placebo by mouth daily for
28 days. Supplementation with milk thistle began the day
after administration of intravenous chemotherapy. Hepatic toxicity was measured at Day 0, Day 28, and Day
56. To monitor adherence, patients were contacted
weekly by telephone interviews and were asked to return
medication containers. Adherence was defined as having
completed at least 80% of the assigned drug or placebo.
Safety monitoring

The safety of MT was monitored by patient visits, chart
reviews, and patient reports. We monitored for published
side-effects associated with administration of MT.14 A safety
monitoring rule was incorporated into the statistical analysis
to screen for rates of grade 3 and 4 toxicities. We also monitored for any unexpected side effects related to MT through
weekly telephone contact by our research assistant who used
a standardized questionnaire that was administered to the
patient or primary guardian during the intervention period.
Milk thistle

Each MT capsule contained 240 mg of milk thistle,
standardized to 80 mg of silibinin (Silybin A and B). The
target dose of silibinin was 5.1 mg/kg/day. Given capsule
sizes and a wide range in the body weight of study

Both the MT (Siliphos) and the placebo were
donated by Thorne Research (Sandpoint, ID). A certificate of analysis accompanied each shipment of MT and
placebo. To ensure purity, content, and stability, MT and
placebo capsules were analyzed independently at the Natural Products Laboratory at the Research Triangle Institute (Research Triangle Park, NC) by using previously
described methodology.10,15 MT was assessed at study
initiation and at the study’s midpoint. A slight but consistent overfill of each MT capsule was observed (281.6 
3.7 mg) with each MT capsule containing a total of 97.0
mg (5.5 mg); silibinin presented as 42.4 mg (2.2 mg)

Table 1. Demographics by Randomized Group

Variable

Plasma silibinin

Plasma silibinin levels were evaluated in the subset of
patients who had reported taking the final dose of MT or
placebo within 2 hours before their routine blood draw.
Plasma silibinin levels were evaluated at each time point by
using previously described methodology.16 The limit of the
detection for each spiked sample was 15 ng/mL (0.031 lM)
with an average recovery of 52%. The maximal sensitivity of
the assay was 0.06 lM for each compound or approximately
0.12 lM for the silibinin mixture.
Statistical Methods
Demographic information and eligibility criteria were summarized by using descriptive statistics for both the MT and
the placebo groups. The 2 groups were compared on these
variables by using either the 2-sample Student t test or the
chi-square test (or Fisher exact test for sparse data).
The main analysis compared groups on liver toxicity, measured by aspartate amino transferase (AST) and
amino alanine transferase (ALT). A 2-sample Student t
test was used to compare mean AST and ALT levels by
group at each time point and to compare the groups on
mean change in AST or ALT from baseline to Day 28 and
from baseline to Day 56. We analyzed the changes in total
bilirubin (TB) by comparing the percentages of patients
with greater than 50% reduction in TB in the 2 groups by
using the chi-square test. The analyses were conducted
with SAS version 9.1 software (Cary, NC). A P-value of
.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant.
Sample size justification

The primary analysis endpoint was evidence of hepatic toxicity, measured by the liver function tests, ALT,
AST, TB at Day 28 and Day 56. Data from previous studies suggest that liver enzyme measurements are more
nearly normally distributed on the logarithmic scale. To
detect a mean difference from pretreatment to post-treatment liver enzymes of 50%, or 0.7 U on the log scale,
assuming log-scale SD to be 0.7, a 2-sample Student t test
has 90% power when there are at least 23 patients per
study arm. To account for possible data losses, we enrolled
25 patients per arm.

RESULTS
In Vitro
Silibinin did not antagonize the activity of vincristine or

observed. We observed a degree of antileukemic synergy
between silibinin and vincristine. Fixed concentration-ratio experiments and cell-survival data revealed a modest
degree of synergism between vincristine and silibinin as
observed by Chou-Talalay17; combination indices ranging from 0.38 to 0.62 (P < .05) over a 20-fold concentration range of the 2 agents (<1.0, synergy; 1.0, simple
additivity, >1.0, antagonism). No such effect was
observed with L-asparaginase and silibinin. Silibinin did
not antagonize vincristine or L-asparaginase-mediated cell
death in T-cell ALL cell culture studies.
Clinical Study
Patients

Informed consent was obtained for the 50 children enrolled from May 2002 to August 2005, with 26 patients randomly assigned to the placebo arm and 24 to the MT arm.
Of the 50 children, 49 were evaluable. One parent withdrew
her child from participation because the child refused to take
any dose of MT. This patient was excluded from the study
analysis.
Baseline characteristics by group assignment are
described in Table 1. The mean ages were 8.7 and 7.0 years
for the MT and placebo groups, respectively. Of the 50

509

Original Article

children, 58% were males, and more patients were in the
standard-risk group (64%) compared with the high-risk
group. No significant differences for any demographic variable were observed.

We did not observe a significant difference in mean
TB levels at each of the time points. However, at Day 28,
5 patients in the MT group and no patients in the placebo
group had greater than a 50% reduction in total bilirubin
during the intervention period (P < .007).

Eligibility and dosing

Most patients (76%) were enrolled because of elevated
ALT (19 per group). In the MT group, 83% of patients
and, in the placebo group, 96% of patients experienced a
grade 2 toxicity; 17% experienced a grade 3 toxicity in the
MT group and 4% in the placebo group. No patients were
identified for participation due to a grade 4 toxicity. Four
patients in the MT group and 10 patients in the placebo
group received 1 capsule (80 mg) per day; 10 patients in the
MT group and 13 patients in the placebo group received 2
capsules (160 mg) per day; 5 in MT and 3 in placebo
received 3 capsules (240 mg) per day; and 4 in the MT and
2 in the placebo received 4 capsules (320 mg) per day.
Silibinin plasma levels

We analyzed plasma silibinin levels in 18 patients at
each time point (9 patients in each group). Plasma samples were processed for quantification of the silibinin
components, Silybin A and Silybin B. Although our limit
of detection was at least 10-fold below the concentration
reported in publications,16 detectable levels of silibinin
compounds were not observed in any of the plasma samples from our study patients.
Evaluation of Liver Toxicity
We investigated changes in mean transaminase and bilirubin levels in the MT and placebo groups over the course
of the study period. The mean levels of AST, ALT, and
TB at Day 0, Day 28, and Day 56 for the treatment and
placebo groups are presented in Figure 3A-C. Mean baseline values did not differ significantly between the groups
for AST, ALT, or TB at baseline or at Day 28. At Day 56,
the MT group had lower AST than the placebo group
(P ¼ .04).
We evaluated the mean reductions in intraindividual AST and ALT over time by using difference scores
from baseline to Day 28 and from baseline to Day 56. No
significant differences between MT and placebo in AST
or ALT from baseline to Day 28 (P ¼ .55; P ¼ .50,
respectively) were observed. At Day 56, the MT group
had a significantly lower AST (P ¼ .05) and a trend toward a significantly lower ALT (P ¼ .07) from baseline
than the placebo group.

Administration of Chemotherapy
We investigated the effects of MT on median doses and
reductions in doses of chemotherapy and delays in administration of chemotherapy. The median dose (range) of
each chemotherapy agent that was potentially modifiable
for hepatoxicity and administered during the intervention
period in the MT and placebo groups were as follows:
Methotrexate, MT 25 mg/m2/week (10-75 mg/m2/
week); Placebo, 20 mg/m2/week (10-40 mg/m2/week); 6
mercaptopurine, MT 500 mg/m2/week (75-1300 mg/
m2/week); Placebo, 413 mg/m2/week (235-900 mg/m2/
week); and Vincristine, MT 1.7 mg/dose (0.6-2 mg/
dose); Placebo, 1.4 mg/dose (0.8-2 mg/dose). Four of 23
and 3 of 26 patients in the MT and placebo groups,
respectively, experienced a delay in therapy. Fourteen
(61%) of patients in the MT group and 19 (73%) of
patients in the placebo group received a reduction in dose
during the 4-week intervention period. No significant differences in doses of chemotherapy administered, reductions of chemotherapy doses, or delays in treatment
between the 2 groups were observed.
Toxicities and Adherence
No significant differences in chemotherapy-related grade 3
or 4 toxicities were observed between the 2 groups (Table
2). Hematologic and infectious toxicities were observed in 6
patients in the MT group and in 17 patients in the placebo
group. Nonhematologic toxicities were observed in 9
patients in the MT group and 6 patients in the placebo
group. No significant differences in the number or severity
of toxicities or rates of infection were found.
The patient-reported side effects in the MT group
were diarrhea,2 flatulence,1 irritability,2 and stomach ache.2
In the placebo group, patient-reported side effects were
decreased appetite,1 diarrhea,2 stomach ache,2 and soft
stools.1 The patient-reported side effects were mild and
were pre-existing complaints before the initiation of treat-

ment with milk thistle. No significant differences in patientreported side effects were found between the 2 groups.
Adherence to the protocol was 68% for the MT
group and 96% for the placebo group (P ¼ .02). We
observed a significant difference in age between patients
that adhered to the study protocol (mean age, 6.9  3
years) in comparison to patients with poor adherence
(13.1  5.4 years) (P ¼ .01).

DISCUSSION
This is the first randomized, controlled, clinical study to
investigate the feasibility and safety of the herbal plant,
milk thistle, in combination with the administration of
chemotherapy in children undergoing treatment for cancer. We found that a short course of MT can be administered to children in the maintenance phase of treatment
for ALL. No unexpected toxicities, reductions in doses of
chemotherapy, or delays in therapy were observed during
the MT supplementation period, despite the intervention
group receiving slightly higher doses of vincristine and 6
mercaptopurine and experiencing a lower percentage of
chemotherapy dose reductions. Our preclinical data demonstrate that MT does not compromise the anticancer activity of L-asparaginase or vincristine in CCRF-CEM cell
lines.
The administration of a 28-day course of MT was
associated with a significant reduction in AST and a trend
toward a significant reduction in ALT at Day 56 but not
immediately after cessation of supplementation. The
effect observed on AST and ALT could be due to delayed
effects of milk thistle, inadequate dosing, or short duration of supplementation. An evaluation of clinical literature shows a wide range of therapeutic doses and
duration.5 At the time of development of this clinical trial
for supportive care, phase 1 studies were not routinely
developed for investigation of herbal or nutritional

511

Original Article

supplements.18,19 Therefore, we chose a short course of
treatment and a conservative dose, as this was the first trial
conducted among children undergoing treatment for cancer. A recent phase 1 study in men with prostate cancer
suggested a dose of 13 g per day for future trials; thus our
dose may have been too conservative.20 Phase 1 trials are
needed in our patient population to determine appropriate dose and duration for both prevention and treatment
of hepatic toxicity.
Our study was strengthened by the product quality
analysis, stability testing, and the goal of quantifying
plasma levels of silibinin. Although detectable silibinin
plasma concentrations were not observed at the doses prescribed, several hypotheses could account for this. Our
limit of detection was 15 ng/mL (0.03 lM) for each compound with a mean recovery of 52%. This corresponds to
0.06 lM for each Silybin A or Silybin B, or 0.12 lM for
the silibinin mixture. Previous studies in adults who had
been administered a similar dose found total silibinin
plasma concentrations were quite variable and nearly
undetectable (0.3 lM  0.3 lM or 144  144 ng/mL).16
Because silibinin analysis is comprised of 2 compounds
(Silybin A and B) that equate to roughly 72 ng/mL each,
the detectable concentrations of each compound was
approximately 36 ng/mL or within 2-fold of our limits of
detection.
Hoh et al collected blood samples within 1-4 hours
of the final dose.16 In the current study, we relied primarily on patient reporting on the timing of the last dose, and
the time to blood draw was outside the 4-hour range in
several cases. When operating near the limits of detection,
the timing of blood draws may be particularly crucial and
should be closely controlled in future studies.
Finally, no information is available on the metabolism of silibinin in pediatric patients compared with
adults. Children may metabolize silibinin isomers at rates
different from that of adults. Taken together, this combination of confounding variables contributes to the lack of
Silybin A or Silybin B detection in patient plasma
samples.
Our study was weakened by a small sample size.
Based upon previously published studies, our study was
powered to detect a reduction in liver function tests of
50% at minimum. However, analysis of the current data
(data not shown), found that this reduction was only
30%, which was achieved according to AST levels at
Day 56. Therefore, our current study was not sufficiently powered to detect a significant treatment effect
at Day 28.

512

We also found that the MT group had a significantly
lower compliance rate compared with the placebo group.
We hypothesize that the treatment effect would be more
pronounced had the compliance rate been improved in
the MT group. Furthermore, assessment of liver toxicity
by ALT and particularly AST levels are limited by their
lack of specificity for chemotherapy-induced hepatocellular injury.
Despite our study’s limitations, it provides preliminary evidence that MT may be a safe, effective, supportive-care agent. Future investigations are needed to
determine the appropriate dose and duration and to identify populations that may gain the largest clinical benefit.
Possible populations are those undergoing treatment for
acute myelogenous leukemia or stem-cell transplantation
in which hepatotoxicity frequently results in interruptions
of treatment. Hepatoprotectant agents could also advance
the management of patients with total parenteral nutrition-induced hepatoxicity.
In conclusion, this was the first study to evaluate
milk thistle, a commonly used dietary supplement, in a
blinded controlled trial among children undergoing treatment for ALL with biochemical evidence of elevated liver
function tests. Future clinical trials should explore MT in
the setting of patients in which hepatic toxicity prevents
provision of the recommended chemotherapy in individuals with cancer.
