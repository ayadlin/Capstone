Abstract

Author Manuscript

Drug resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains a major problem warranting new
treatment strategies. Wnt/catenin signaling is critical for the self-renewal of normal hematopoietic
progenitor cells. Deregulated Wnt signaling is evident in chronic and acute myeloid leukemia,
however little is known about ALL. Differential interaction of catenin with either the Kat3
coactivator CREBBP (CBP) or the highly homologous EP300 (p300) is critical to determine
divergent cellular responses and provides a rationale for the regulation of both proliferation and
differentiation by the Wnt signaling pathway. Usage of the coactivator CBP by catenin leads to
transcriptional activation of cassettes of genes that are involved in maintenance of progenitor cell
self-renewal. However, the use of the coactivator p300, leads to activation of genes involved in the
initiation of differentiation. ICG-001 is a novel small molecule modulator of Wnt/catenin

signaling, which specifically binds to the N-terminus of CBP and not p300, within amino acids 1–
110, thereby disrupting the interaction between CBP and catenin. Here, we report that selective
disruption of the CBP/β- and γ-catenin interactions using ICG-001 leads to differentiation of pre-B
ALL cells and loss of self-renewal capacity. Survivin, an inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein, was also
downregulated in primary ALL after treatment with ICG-001. Using ChIP assay, we demonstrate
occupancy by CBP of the survivin promoter, which is decreased by ICG-001 in primary ALL.
CBP-mutations have been recently identified in a significant percentage of ALL patients,
however, almost all of the identified mutations reported occur C-terminal to the binding site for
ICG-001. Importantly, ICG-001, regardless of CBP mutational status and chromosomal
aberration, leads to eradication of drug-resistant primary leukemia in combination with
conventional therapy in vitro and significantly prolongs the survival of NOD/SCID mice engrafted
with primary ALL. Therefore, specifically inhibiting CBP/catenin transcription represents a novel
approach to overcome relapse in ALL.

Introduction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Despite significant progress over the last decades, drug resistance remains a major problem
in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (1). The potential for dose
escalation of current chemotherapeutics is limited by acute and chronic toxicity, therefore
new treatment modalities are required. The Wnt pathway has been implicated in the selfrenewal and differentiation of normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (2–4). Aberrant
Wnt/catenin signaling has been described to play critical roles in acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) cells (5), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells (6;7), where leukemic drug
resistant clones have been associated with increased nuclear β-catenin levels (8). However,
little is known about Wnt signaling in ALL. It has been described that Wnt-3a mediates
proliferation of precursor B-ALL cell lines NALM6, REH and LK63 (9) and endogenous
WNT16b expression has been found to be upregulated by the TCF3-PBX1 (E2A-PBX1)
fusion gene (10). siRNA knockdown of WNT16b, decreasing canonical Wnt/β-catenin
signaling, has been shown to initiate apoptosis and reduces the expression of the Wnt
regulated inhibitor of apoptosis protein family member, survivin (BIRC5) (10), implicated in
both the survival and drug resistance of leukemia cells (11–14). The Wnt pathway is
classically mediated through the central signaling effector molecule β-catenin (15). Nuclear
β-catenin recruits the Kat3 transcriptional co-activators, CREBBP (CBP) or its closely
related homolog EP300 (p300), as well as other components of the basal transcriptional
apparatus (16;17). The distinct roles of the co-activators, CBP in self-renewal and p300 in
differentiation of normal hematopoietic cells has been previously described (18). The
controversial dichotomous behavior of Wnt/catenin signaling in controlling both
proliferation and differentiation can be readily explained by differential coactivator usage: i.e. CBP/catenin-mediated transcription maintains cellular potency and that partnering with
p300 is a first critical step to initiate differentiation (19–21). The usage of p300 as a
coactivator can be pharmacologically induced by ICG-001, a novel low molecular weight

small molecule modulator that binds specifically within amino acids 1–110 at the Nterminus of CBP (22). ICG-001 had been previously identified using a secondary structuretemplated chemical library in a forward chemical genomic screen, looking for compounds
that inhibited the β-catenin/T cell factor (TCF)-responsive reporter TOPFLASH in colorectal
cancer cells (22). ICG-001, down-regulates β-catenin/TCF signaling by specifically binding
to cyclic AMP response element-binding protein CREBBP (CBP) thereby disrupting the
CBP/catenin interaction. We hypothesized that disrupting the CBP/catenin interaction could
safely sensitize patient-derived (primary) pre-B ALL cells to conventional chemotherapy via
forced differentiation associated with p300/catenin coactivator usage. Here, we report that
drug resistant primary pre-B-ALL cells can be induced to differentiate using the novel CBPspecific small molecule inhibitor, ICG-001, thereby sensitizing them to either targeted or
conventional chemotherapy, overcoming drug resistance.

Results
ICG-001 blocks the interaction of catenin with CBP in ALL cells

Author Manuscript

Initially, we examined nuclear β- and γ-catenin levels in 13 primary (pre-B) ALL cases
encompassing various cytogenetic aberrations (BCR/ABL1, TEL-AML1, E2A-PBX1,
MLL-AF4, and normal karyotype) and two pre-B ALL cell lines BV173 (BCR/ABL-1) and
380 (t(8;14), t(14;18)). Nuclear β and/or γ-catenin, albeit with variability in expression
levels, were significantly increased compared with normal pre-B cells, as judged by
immunoblot (Figure 1a and supplemental Table S1). As β- and γ-catenin have been
implicated in self-renewal of leukemic cells, we evaluated a small molecule inhibitor of the
CBP/catenin interaction, ICG-001. ICG-001 binds specifically to the N-terminus (amino
acids 1–110) of the coactivator CBP, thereby disrupting CBP/β-catenin, as well as CBP/γcatenin-mediated transcription (22). To confirm biochemically that ICG-001 also disrupts
the CBP/catenin interaction in primary pre-B ALL cells, pre-B ALL cells SFO2 (BCR/
ABL-1+) and LAX7R (normal karyotype) (Supplemental Table S1), who relapsed despite
having received chemotherapy, were treated with ICG-001 (10µM) or vehicle control
(DMSO). Isolated nuclear proteins were immunoprecipitated with CBP or p300 specific
antibodies and probed for catenin. As anticipated, ICG-001 specifically decreased the
binding of catenin, primarily γ-catenin in these cells, with CBP, with a concomitant increase
in p300/γ-catenin association (Figure 1b, 1c; Supplementary Figure S2). As previously
demonstrated in multiple cell types (21;22), ICG-001 also in primary ALL cells binds to
CBP, sequesters the CBP N-terminus, making it less available for binding to catenin, and
thereby enhancing the catenin/p300 interaction.

Survivin/BIRC5, is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, which we have
previously shown to be a CBP/catenin target gene in a number of cancer cell types (21;23).
Survivin is highly expressed in primary ALL cells compared to CD19+ B cells from healthy
donors (Supplementary Figure S3). Treatment with ICG-001 (10µM) demonstrated
significant down-regulation of both survivin mRNA by qPCR and protein by Western
blotting in primary LAX7R (Figure 2a, b; as well as other primary isolates, Supplementary
Figure S4). Coactivator occupancy in LAX7R cells with or without ICG-001 treatment was
assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Without treatment, CBP is

primarily associated with the survivin promoter (Figure 2c). After ICG-001 treatment, there
is dramatically reduced occupancy of CBP at the survivin promoter, with a large
concomitant increase in p300 occupancy. These data are consistent with our previous report
of a repressive complex being assembled in conjunction with p300 recruitment to the
survivin promoter (21). We also determined if a mutant CBP protein can bind to the survivin
promoter utilizing ChIP assay with BV173 ALL cells (Supplementary Table S1). Similarly,
in BV173 cells we found that CBP occupancy at the survivin promoter was decreased by
ICG-001, with a concomitant increase in p300 occupancy (Supplementary Figure S5). We
also observed decreased proliferation of primary pre-B ALL cells (LAX7R) (Figure 2d,
Supplementary Figure S1). However, cell viability remained unchanged after treatment with
ICG-001, as judged by Annexin V staining; demonstrating ICG-001 is not toxic to LAX7R
cells (Figure 2e). Taken together, ICG-001 specifically binds to CBP and potently blocks
catenin (both β and γ)-mediated expression of survivin and proliferation of ALL cells.

ICG-001 decreases self-renewal capacity of ALL cells

Author Manuscript

To determine the effect of ICG-001 on CBP/catenin-mediated self-renewal in ALL, we
developed a colony forming unit (CFU) assay for primary ALL cells supplementing
semisolid agar with an equal number of irradiated OP9 feeder layer cells at the bottom of
each dish to enable the growth of primary ALL cells. Two primary ALL samples (LAX7R,
SFO2) (Figure 3a–f), were treated with ICG-001 (10µM) or control, and plated in methocult.
LAX7R cells showed a significant reduction of colony counts in primary platings after
ICG-001 treatment (Figure 3a, b), as compared with the DMSO controls (p<0.05).
Secondary colony formation was further significantly reduced (Figure 3c). As anticipated,
the DMSO controls, remained re-platable. Similarly, with the second primary leukemia
sample (SFO2), we observed a dramatic reduction in secondary colonies with ICG-001
treatment (10µM), whereas control treated cells continued to be serially re-platable (Figure
3f). Our data indicates that ICG-001 abrogates self-renewal of ALL cells.
ICG-001 differentiates leukemia cells

Author Manuscript

ICG-001 disrupts the interaction between CBP and catenins, resulting in the increased
associations of catenins with p300 in ALL. Usage by catenin of p300 as its coactivator is the
first critical step towards initiating the process of differentiation (19;20). To evaluate
whether ICG-001 would induce differentiation of ALL leukemia cells, we utilized an in
vitro system for inducible pre–B cell differentiation of Ig κ and λ light chain gene
rearrangement (24;25). This system allows for a detailed analysis of the differentiation of
large cycling pre–BII cells (26) to small resting pre–BII cells and ultimately to the immature
B cell stage (27). SLP65−/− bone marrow cells were transduced using a murine stem cell
(MSCV) retrovirus encoding BCR-ABL1 as a positive control (28). BCR-ABL1–transduced
CD19+ B220+ pre–B cells (Figure 4a) were treated with ICG-001 (5µM and 10µM) for 2
days (Figure 4a). Murine leukemia cells differentiated as determined by flow cytometric
analysis of increased κ light chain surface expression (Figure 4b and c) and decreased
proliferation (Figure 4d). As a positive control, BCR-ABL1–transduced pre–B cells (CD19+
B220+) were induced to differentiate by inhibition of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity using
Imatinib (1µM). To address whether this effect of ICG-001 was principally mediated
through ICG-001 reduction of survivin, we examined ICG-001-induced differentiation in

vector control cells or survivin-depleted murine BCR-ABL1+ ALL cells (Supplementary
Figure S6a–d). We observed that κ light chain expression was not affected by survivin
depletion (Supplementary Figure S6c), although survivin-depleted cells showed reduced cell
number compared to survivin-competent cells (p<0.05) (Supplementary Figure S6d). We
also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting that as
anticipated the binding of β-catenin to CBP was dramatically inhibited and concomitantly
the binding of β-catenin to p300 was increased by ICG-001 in BCR-ABL1–transduced pre–B
ALL cells (Figure 4e). These data demonstrate that ICG-001 dose dependently induced the
differentiation of leukemia cells.
ICG-001 synergizes with chemotherapy to eradicate ALL cellsin vitro

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

ICG-001 was not toxic to ALL cells but did induce their differentiation. Therefore, we
examined if combination treatment of ICG-001 and chemotherapy could overcome drug
resistance in primary leukemia cells in vitro. We have shown in Figure 1a, that nuclear β
and/or γ-catenin are significantly increased, albeit at various levels, in both primary pre-B
ALL and two pre-B ALL cell lines, compared to normal pre-B cells. We anticipated that
ICG-001 would be broadly active in ALL regardless of the leukemia subtype. Therefore, we
selected 5 ALL patient samples, from patients at diagnosis who relapsed after therapy, for
treatment with chemotherapy for 19–34 days, with or without ICG-001. VDL was used to
treat the Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph−) ALL cells (LAX7R, SFO3). The tyrosine
kinase inhibitor nilotinib, was used for the Philadelphia chromosome positive, Ph+, ALL
cells (ICN1, TXL3, SFO2) (Supplementary Table S1). Persistent viability of all of the ALL
samples after extended (2 – 4 weeks) treatment indicated that the ALL cells were resistant to
conventional chemotherapy alone (Fig 5a–e). In marked contrast, within the same treatment
period all five primary ALL cells that received a combination of chemotherapy plus
ICG-001 had been eradicated as determined by decreased cell viability and cell number
(Figure 5a–e, Figure S7). Not surprisingly, ICG-001 alone did not lead to elimination of
ALL cells. However, importantly, when the primary pre B-ALL cells (LAX7R) were first
treated with ICG-001 (10µM) as a single agent, followed by addition of VDL with no further
addition of ICG-001 (Figure 5f), the primary ALL cells were also eradicated. The
Combination Index (C.I.) for ED50 (median effective dose to inhibit 50% of cells) (29),
ED75, and ED90 in SFO2 cells demonstrated synergism of ICG-001 with chemotherapy
(Figure 5g). These results demonstrated that ICG-001 by specifically targeting the CBP/
catenin interaction in ALL leads to the differentiation of ALL cells, thereby sensitizing drug
resistant leukemia cells to chemotherapy. This was observed in five out of five cases
examined, either when ICG-001 was given prior to or concomitantly with chemotherapy,
leading to essentially complete ablation of the drug-resistant ALL cell population.

ICG-001 eradicates ALL cells bearing CBP mutations in vitro
Recently, novel sequence or deletion mutations of CBP have been identified in ALL (30;31).
Interestingly, none of these mutations has been found in the extreme N-terminus of CBP, the
site at which both catenin and ICG-001 bind to the coactivator. The majority of mutations
have been mapped to the HAT domain. Nevertheless, we evaluated the efficacy of ICG-001
on two ALL cell lines (380 and BV173) that harbor CBP mutations (Figure 6a) (30). These
ALL cell lines were viable despite chemotherapy, reflecting their resistance to conventional

chemotherapy alone (Figure 6b,c). Monotherapy with ICG-001 alone did not lead to
elimination of these ALL cells. In marked contrast, chemotherapy in combination with
ICG-001, within the same treatment period, completely eradicated both ALL cell lines. As
anticipated, the presence of these mutations did not affect the molecular mechanism or
efficacy of ICG-001, as the mutations are C-terminal to the ICG-001 binding site. Similar
results were obtained for both the five primary ALL cases, for which the CBP mutational
status are unknown (Figure 5), as well as both CBP mutated ALL cell lines, in that they
were resistant to chemotherapy alone, yet eradicated at the end of the combination of
chemotherapy plus ICG-001 (Figure 6 b,c). Our data demonstrates that using ICG-001 to
specifically target the CBP/catenin in ALL cells synergizes with chemotherapy in vitro,
leading to complete ablation of the drug-resistant cell population, even in ALL cells that
harbor CBP mutations.

For preclinical in vivo evaluations of ICG-001, we used a xenograft model as described in
(11;11) with three primary pre-B ALL cases – two Ph− ALLs (LAX7R, LAX3) with normal
karyotype and one Ph+ ALL (TXL3). Cells were injected into sublethally irradiated NSG
mice and treated with ICG-001 (50mg/kg/day for LAX3 or 100mg/kg/day for LAX7R and
TXL3 via subcutaneous osmotic minipump), with or without respective chemotherapy; VDL
for Ph− ALL (via i.p. injection) and Nilotinib (NTB p.o.) for Ph+ ALL. Pooled survival
analysis of the three primary ALLs displayed markedly prolonged survival in the cohort that
received chemotherapy plus ICG-001 (n=15), compared with the chemotherapy only treated
mice (n=13) (Median Survival Time: MST=100 days vs. MST=85 days; p<0001) (Figure
7d). The saline-control treated (PBS) LAX7R mice died rapidly with a MST of 34 days
(n=3). Similarly, ICG-only treated mice died with a MST of 37.5 days (n=4). Combined
VDL and ICG-001 treatment (n=3) significantly prolonged survival, compared to the VDL
only treated animals (n=4) (MST = 76 days vs. MST=66.5 days; p<0.016) (Figure 7a). In a
pilot experiment lentiviral luciferase-labeled LAX7R cells were injected into NOD/SCID
mice to determine reduction in leukemia burden by ICG-001 in combination with
chemotherapy. Bioluminescent imaging demonstrated a significantly reduced leukemic load
in the VDL+ICG-001-treated mice compared to the VDL only-treated mice (Figure S8a,b).
As for the TXL3 (Ph+ ALL) mice, the saline treated group died rapidly (n=2) (MST=62.5
days), the Nilotinib (NTB) only group had a MST=85 days (n=3). Combined NTB+ICG-001
treated mice (n=4) lived significantly longer, as compared to the NTB only treated mice
(MST=114 days vs. MST=85 days; p<0.024) (Figure 7b). Similar outcomes were observed
in the Ph− ALLs LAX3 mice – VDL/ICG-001 treated group (n=8) has MST=98.5 days of
vs. VDL-only treated mice (n=6) with MST=88.5 days; p<0.0001 (Figure 7c). Importantly,
assessment of hematopoietic parameters after treatment of NSG mice with VDL with and
without ICG-001 showed no significant changes (Supplementary Table S2). We interpret
these results that ICG-001 has no deleterious effects on normal hematopoiesis.
In summary, our data clearly demonstrates that specifically targeting the CBP/catenin
interaction using ICG-001 initiates the differentiation of ALL leukemia cells, thereby

Discussion

Wnt signaling is a key signal transduction pathway in both normal and cancer stem cells
(32) and β-catenin has been shown to be critical in the self-renewal of normal hematopoietic
stem cells (2;3). Aberrant Wnt/β- and γ-catenin signaling has been described in the
development of AML (5;33) and has also been identified as a critical pathway in the selfrenewal of CML (6;7). Overexpression of γ-catenin has been observed in numerous cancers
(23;33;34). Furthermore, transduction of γ -catenin into primitive hematopoietic progenitor
cells preserved their immature phenotype during colony growth, which suggests enhanced
self-renewal activity. Furthermore, γ -catenin transduced cells accelerated the development
of leukemia in syngenic murine hosts (33). However, it should be noted that loss of both βand γ-catenin leaves wnt signaling, hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis intact (35), pointing to
a yet uncharacterized catenin-like molecule that can compensate for the loss of both β- and
γ-catenin. The role of Wnt/catenin signaling in ALL, however remains unclear. To generate
a transcriptionally active complex, β-catenin recruits the coactivators CBP or its closely
related homolog p300, as well as other members of the basal transcriptional apparatus
(16;17). Wnt/β-catenin transcription activates a number of downstream target genes (e.g. cmyc, cyclin D1) including survivin (22). Survivin is a Wnt target gene whose expression has
been shown to be CBP/catenin-mediated (21). Recently, it has been demonstrated that
targeting survivin with shRNA or an antisense oligonucleotide increased primary ALL
apoptosis, particularly in combination with chemotherapeutic agents (11;13;14). Targeting
the CBP/catenin interaction with ICG-001, forcing differentiation and additionally downregulating survivin expression, thereby sensitizing the cells to chemotherapy, would appear
to be an attractive strategy to maximize chemotherapeutic potency without increasing
toxicity to treat ALL.

Author Manuscript

The coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 comprise the unique KAT3 family
of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) (36). A crucial role for both p300 and CBP in
development was shown in mice where homozygous deletion of either gene (Ep300 and
Crebbp for the proteins p300 and CBP respectively) resulted in embryonic lethality at a very
early stage (37;38). Interestingly, double heterozygous Ep300+/−/Crebbp+/− mice also die in
utero (37), indicating that a fine-tuned balance in the expression of both proteins is needed
to ensure normal development. We previously demonstrated that CBP and p300 have
distinct functions in the regulation of β-catenin-mediated gene transcription (22;39)
including survivin (21). Rebel et al. (18), using a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) model,
concluded that CBP (and not p300) is essential for HSC self-renewal, whereas p300 is
critical for proper hematopoietic differentiation. Kawasaki et al. (40) found that p300, but
not CBP, is absolutely required for retinoic acid-induced F9 cell differentiation.
Furthermore, both coactivators are critical in peripheral B cells (41). Despite their high
degree of homology and similar ubiquitous patterns of expression, it is clear that CBP and
p300 play unique and distinct roles in gene regulation, which has recently been confirmed at
the genome wide level using ChIP-seq (42). The effects of CBP/catenin antagonism on wnt
target genes are highly promoter-specific, as some wnt/catenin-regulated genes like survivin

apparently utilize CBP as its co-activator for transcription, while others permissively use
either CBP or p300, whereas others appear to utilize p300 almost exclusively (20;39). We
have previously demonstrated reduction of survivin by ICG-001 in vivo in a xenograft model
of colorectal cancer (22). Of note, even though survivin is involved in terminal
differentiation in erythropoiesis (43), we demonstrate that ICG-001 induced ALL
differentiation is independent of survivin reduction, as kappa light chain expression is
similarly induced with or without survivin depletion in BCR-ABL1+ ALL cells
(Supplementary Fig S6a–d). Therefore, survivin reduction is not sufficient to induce
differentiation in ALL cells, demonstrating that decreased survivin is a not the primary
driver for inducing differentiation. Upon inhibition of CBP/catenin binding, several potential
promoter specific outcomes can occur including downregulation of CBP-only regulated
genes, compensatory maintenance by p300 or even upregulation of genes using both CBP
and p300, and finally activation of p300-dependent regulated genes (20;39). Utilizing
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP), we have previously demonstrated that
coactivator switching from CBP to p300 at the survivin promoter is associated with the
recruitment of transcriptionally repressive elements via p300, thereby decreasing gene
expression (20;21).

A variety of ways to inhibit wnt signaling are currently under investigation for
hematological malignancies (44–46). However, CBP/catenin antagonists such as ICG-001,
and the second generation clinical compound PRI-724, are the only well characterized small
molecule-inhibitors, that binds specifically to the N-terminal (a.a. 1–111) of CBP, thereby
blocking the interaction with the C-terminal catenin trans activation domain (647–781),
leaving the rest of the large CBP protein (300kDa) functionally intact (22). In addition, and
of critical importance to its therapeutic utility, despite the close homology of CBP and p300,
the specificity of ICG-001 avoids interference with p300/catenin dependent signaling (22),
thereby allowing for cellular differentiation and maintenance of normal stem cell
populations (20).

In humans, heterozygous point mutations and micro-deletions in CBP and rarely in p300,
have been identified in Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome patients. This rare disorder (~1 in
100,000 live births) is characterized by mental retardation, craniofacial malformations and
increased occurrence of malignancies (47;48). Recently, sequence or deletion mutations of
CBP have also been identified in ALL (30;31). Extensive analysis of an extended cohort of
71 diagnosis-ALL relapse cases and 270 acute leukemia cases that did not relapse found that
18.3% of relapse cases had sequence or deletion mutations of CBP. In addition, inactivating
CBP mutations have been described as a common event in follicular lymphoma and diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (49) the two most frequent forms of B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s
Lymphoma. Interestingly, of the hundreds of sequenced samples, most occurred within the
HAT domain and none were described within the N-terminus of CBP, which constitutes
both the catenin and ICG-001 binding site (Figure 6a). We propose that based upon the
critical role for the CBP N-terminal/catenin interaction in maintaining the leukemia
initiating cells that comprise the drug resistant ALL progenitor population, mutations in this
region of CBP will generally not be selected for. Importantly from a therapeutic standpoint,
we have demonstrated that as anticipated, ICG-001 can also sensitize B-ALL cell lines

harboring CBP mutations to chemotherapy. These defective mutations are located in the
HAT domain. HAT defective CBP may behave as a dominant negative, allowing binding of
CBP to catenin without HAT enzymatic activity, which may be importantly involved in
coactivator switching to p300 and subsequent p300 driven differentiation. ICG-001 does not
work through the HAT domain, as it is located in the extreme N-terminus. ICG-001 by
blocking the CBP/catenin interaction could thus remove the dominant negative HAT
defective CBP from promoters, thereby allowing for enhanced p300 recruitment (Figure 1b).

Author Manuscript

Taken together, these recent findings emphasize an important role for the CBP/catenin
interaction in maintaining drug resistant ALL leukemia initiating cells. The fundamental
therapeutic concept outlined is that CBP/catenin antagonism can deplete drug resistant
leukemia stem/progenitor cells by interruption of self-renewal and shift of catenin/
coactivator function and selective induction of differentiation at the expense of self-renewal
capacity (Figure 3) (20). Here, we demonstrate abrogation of self-renewal by inhibition of
serial replatability of primary ALL cells. As analysis of differentiation of primary human
pre-B ALL cells is difficult, we used an in vitro system for inducible pre–B cell
differentiation and Ig κ and λ light chain gene rearrangement (24–27). ICG-001 induced
dose-dependent differentiation of murine BCR-ABL1–transformed pre–B cells
(CD19+B220+) as determined by analysis of κ light chain surface expression.

Taken together, we have shown that selective suppression of CBP/catenin signaling using
the novel specific small-molecule inhibitor ICG-001 offers the opportunity to safely
abrogate leukemia by disrupting the self-renewal of drug resistant leukemia initiating cells
via forced differentiation, thereby sensitizing them to either cytotoxic or targeted
chemotherapy to eradicate the leukemia. Therefore, inhibition of CBP/catenin driven selfrenewal is a fundamental concept, and targeting it using specific CBP/catenin antagonists in
combination with conventional therapy represents a promising therapeutic strategy to
eradicate drug resistant leukemia initiating cells.

Materials and Methods

Western blotting

Author Manuscript

Nuclear fractions isolated as described above or total cell lysate obtained from lysis in MPER buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) supplemented with a 1% protease inhibitor
cocktail (Pierce, Rockford, IL), were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to PVDF membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The following antibodies were
used: anti-survivin (D-8), anti-β-Actin (AC-15) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA); anti-β-catenin (Clone 14) and anti-γ-catenin (Clone 15) (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA).
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay

Author Manuscript

Nuclear proteins were incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal CBP antibody,
A-22; rabbit polyclonal p300 antibody, N-15; normal rabbit IgG) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) overnight at 4°C. Protein-antibody aggregates were then incubated with
Protein A-agarose (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) for 1 hour. The immunoprecipitated
proteins were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot using mouse
monoclonal anti-β-catenin or γ-catenin (BD Biosciences). For quantification of Western blot
band, we utilized the software Image J (java image processing program). Band densities
were normalized to the corresponding IgG control.
ChIP Assay

Author Manuscript

ChIP assays were conducted essentially as described in Spencer et al. (2003) (50).
Immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies against CBP, p300 and control IgG
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The captured immunocomplexes containing bound
transcriptional DNA fragments were eluted, with recovered DNA fragments used for PCR
amplification, using specific primers for the consensus human BIRC5 promoter, F: 5'ggggcgctaggtgtggg-3' and R: 5'-ttcaaatctggcggttaatggc-3'.
CFU Assays

Author Manuscript

Primary ALL cells were plated with ICG-001 or DMSO vehicle control in triplicate on a
murine OP-9 feeder layer in MethoCult GF+ H4435 (StemCell Tech, Vancouver, BC) and
incubated at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2 for 14–21 days. Colonies were counted under
phase contrast microscopy (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY) and Orca
C4742-80-12AG camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ) at room temperature
under 2.5×. The microscope and camera were controlled by Micro-Manager 1.4 software.
100× magnification photographs for colonies were acquired under light microscope using
QCapture software 2.98 (Quantitative Imaging Corp; Surrey, BC Canada) via a QImaging
QiCam, mounted to an Olympus IX71 microscope.
Flow cytometry
Anti-mouse Ig κ light chain -PE (Clone 187.1) as well as its isotype control Anti-mouse
IgG1-PE (R3–34) antibodies (BD Biosciences) were used for phenotyping murine BCRABL1 p210 ALL cells treated with ICG-001 or Imatinib.

As a positive control for mouse Ig kappa light chain, bone marrow cells from SLP65−/− mice
were harvested and cultured in the presence of 10ng/ml on retronectin (Takara Bio Inc.)coated plates and retrovirally transformed by BCR-ABL1 as described earlier. 11 Ig kappa
light chain was induced by either ICG-001 or imatinib treatment for 48hrs and determined
by flow cytometry. Anti-mouse CD19 and B220 were purchased from eBioScience (San
Diego, CA). PE-conjugated Annexin V and 7-AAD for apoptosis analyses were obtained
from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA).
In Vitro Drug Testing

Author Manuscript

Cells cultured on irradiated murine OP-9 were treated with VDL (Vincristine,
Dexamethasone, and L-Aparaginase) or Nilotinib combined with ICG-001, at various
concentrations. Cell viability was determined by either trypan blue exclusion or flow
cytometry. The Combination Index (C.I.) for ED50 (median effective dose to inhibit 50% of
cells), ED75, and ED90 were calculated using Chou and Talalay median effects analysis
(CalcuSyn2.0 Software; Cambridge, United Kingdom) (29).
Xenograft model of primary leukemia
Primary ALL cells were transplanted into sublethally irradiated (250 cGy) NOD.CgPrkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) or NOD/SCID mice via intravenous injection as described
previously (11).
In Vivo Drug Testing

Author Manuscript

Mice were treated with Nilotinib (p.o.) or VDL (Vincristine, Dexamethasone and LAsparaginase) (i.p.) combined with ICG-001 for 28 days. ICG-001 was delivered via
subcutaneous micro-osmotic pump (Model 1004; Alzet, Cupertino, CA) to ensure stable
plasma dosing levels. Mice were under routine observation with individual weights tracked
and used as criteria for sacrifice, upon 20% percent-loss from initial pre-treatment
recordings. Animal care was in accordance with institutional guidelines.
In Vivo Imaging

Author Manuscript

Primary ALL cells were labeled with a lentiviral firefly luciferase vector by transduction
with pCCL-MNDU3-LUC viral supernatant as described previously (11) and injected into
sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice. Leukemia progression in mice at indicated time
points was monitored using an in vivo IVIS 100 bioluminescence/optical imaging system
(Xenogen). D-Luciferin (Promega) dissolved in PBS was injected intraperitoneally at a dose
of 2.5mg per mouse, 15 minutes prior to measuring the luminescence signal. General
anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane and continued during the procedure with 2%
isoflurane introduced via a nose cone. Mice were monitored for weight loss and other
leukemia symptoms. Moribund mice were sacrificed and tissues were analyzed for leukemia
cell infiltration to confirm leukemia as the cause of death. All mouse experiments were
subject to institutional approval by Children’s Hospital Los Angeles IACUC.

CBC Counts

Author Manuscript

Peripheral blood was withdrawn for CBC analysis via tail vein. Blood samples (~100µl/
sample) were collected in BD microtainer tubes with EDTA (BD Biosciences) and analyzed
by VetScan HM5 cell counter (Abaxis, Union City, CA).
Survivinfl/fl mice

Author Manuscript

Survivin-floxed mice were originally obtained from E.M. Conway (University of British
Columbia, Vancouver, Canada). As previously described (11), survivinfl/fl bone marrow
cells were retrovirally transduced with BCR-ABL1 p210. For competitive growth assays,
oncogenically transformed cells were transduced with either retroviral pMSCV EmptyERt2
or pMSCV CreERt2 followed by puromycin selection (1µg/mL). Conditional deletion was
achieved using tamoxifen (1µM) for 4 days. a. Survivin deleted (CreERt2) and undeleted
(EmptyERt2) cells were then plated in triplicate and treated with either ICG-001 or imatinib
or both for 48hrs prior to flow cytometric assay including apoptosis by Annexin V/7-AAD
and Ig κ light chain expression by anti-mouse Ig κ light chain PE antibody (BD Bioscience).

incubated with CBP and p300 antibody. Western blot was performed using the antibodies
against β-catenin.

ICG-001 combined with chemotherapy eradicates ALLs in vitro. (a) Cell viability of
LAX7R treated continuously with ICG-001 and/or VDL (Vincristine 0.5nM,
Dexamethasone 5pM, 0.0005 IU L-Asparaginase) for 31 days. (b) Cell viability of SFO3
cells treated with either ICG-001 or VDL or both for 22 days. Cell viability of ICN1 (c),
TXL3 (d) and SFO2 (e) are shown, which were treated continuously with Nilotinib (1µM)
and/or ICG-001 (10 µM) until the end of follow-up. (f) Pre B-ALL cells (LAX7R) were
preincubated with ICG-001 (10µM) only for 7 days followed by addition of VDL

Combined ICG-001 and chemotherapy treatment prolongs survival in 3 primary ALL cases.
Kaplan-Meier curves of NOD/SCID IL2Rγ−/− mice recipients of patient-derived LAX7R
(a), TXL3 (b) and LAX3 (c) cells. (d) Pooled Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival for 3
ALL xenografts (LAX7R, LAX3 and TXL3) in NOD/SCID IL2Rγ−/− (NSG) mice are
shown. Mice were treated with Nilotinib (50mg/kg/day) or VDL (Vincristine 0.5mg/kg/day,
Dexamethasone 10.5mg/kg/day and L-Asparaginase 1500IU/kg/day) combined with
ICG-001 (50mg/kg/day for LAX3, while TXL3 and LAX7R received 100mg/kg/day) for 28
days. Pooled MST of the saline group (n=11) was 54 days, of the ICG-001 only group (n=7)
was 38 days, of the chemotherapy (Nilotinib or VDL) only group (n=13) was 85 days. MST
of chemotherapy/ICG-001 treated group (n=15) was 100 days (chemotherapy vs
chemotherapy + ICG-001: p<0.0001).
