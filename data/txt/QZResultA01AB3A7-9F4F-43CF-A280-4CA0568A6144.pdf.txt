Abstract
The gene encoding lysyl oxidase (LOX) was identified as the
ras recision gene (rrg), with the ability to revert Ras-mediated
transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Mutations in RAS genes
have been found in f25% of lung cancers and in 85% of
pancreatic cancers. In microarray analysis, these cancers were
found to display reduced LOX gene expression. Thus, the
ability of the LOX gene to repress the transformed phenotype
of these cancer cells was tested. LOX is synthesized as a 50-kDa
secreted precursor Pro-LOX that is processed to the 32-kDa
active enzyme (LOX) and to an 18-kDa propeptide (LOX-PP).
Recently, we mapped the rrg activity of Pro-LOX to the LOX-PP
in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Ectopic Pro-LOX and LOXPP expression in H1299 lung cancer cells inhibited growth
in soft agar and invasive colony formation in Matrigel and
reduced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) and Akt, with LOX-PP showing substantially higher
activity. Similarly, LOX-PP expression in PANC-1 pancreatic
cancer cells effectively reduced ERK and Akt activity and
inhibited growth in soft agar and ability of these cells to
migrate. Nuclear Factor-KB (NF-KB) and its target gene BCL2,
which are overexpressed in 70% to 75% of pancreatic cancers,
have recently been implicated in invasive phenotype. LOX-PP
substantially reduced NF-KB and Bcl-2 levels. Reintroduction
of Bcl-2 into PANC-1 or H1299 cells expressing LOX-PP
restored the transformed phenotype, suggesting that Bcl-2 is
an essential target. Thus, LOX-PP potently inhibits invasive
phenotype of lung and pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting
potential therapeutic applications in treatment of these
cancers. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6278–85]

Introduction
The RAS gene family (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS) encodes small
GTPase proteins that transduce signals that promote growth and
survival from membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases
(reviewed in ref. 1). Oncogenic mutations of RAS, which prevent
GTP hydrolysis and cause persistent signaling, promote transformed phenotype. Mutated Ras proteins have been detected in
25% of lung cancers and in up to 85% of pancreatic cancers (2–5),

which are two of the most deadly human cancers. The American
Cancer Society estimates that these cancers will be responsible
for f190,000 combined deaths in the United States in 2006 (6).
Oncogenic RAS activates several distinct signal transduction
pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
and Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase pathways (7). These cascades
can activate the Nuclear Factor-nB (NF-nB) family of factors,
which directly induces expression of genes that promote cell
survival and proliferation, resistance to chemotherapy, neoplastic
transformation, and maintenance of invasive phenotype (8–12).
Constitutive activation of the RelA NF-nB subunit, which is also
known as p65, was found in 70% of pancreatic cancers and plays
an important role in pancreatic tumorigenesis (13–15). The
antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 (BCL2) is a tissue-specific NF-nB target
gene, and its up-regulation has been implicated in 75% of
pancreatic cancers (13, 16). Inhibition of constitutive NF-nB
activity by ectopic expression of the specific inhibitory protein
InB-a suppressed the tumorigenicity of the human PANC-1
pancreatic cancer cell line in an orthotopic nude mouse model
and reduced BCL2 expression (17). Furthermore, small interfering
RNA targeting BCL2 was antiproliferative and exhibited proapoptotic effects only in tumor cells, while having little effect in
fibroblasts or nonmalignant tissues (18), and was shown to delay
growth of pancreatic cancer in a xenograft model (18). Of interest,
expression of Bcl-2 in prostate cancer was recently shown to
promote progression to a metastatic phenotype (19).
The LOX enzyme catalyzes lysine-derived covalent cross-links
required for the normal structural integrity of the extracellular
matrix (20, 21). The 50-kDa inactive proenzyme (Pro-LOX) is
secreted into the extracellular environment and then processed by
proteolytic cleavage to a functional 32-kDa LOX enzyme and an
18-kDa propeptide (LOX-PP; ref. 22). The LOX gene was found to
have the capacity to revert Ras-mediated transformation of NIH
3T3 cells and was termed the ‘‘ras recision’’ gene (rrg; refs. 23, 24). In
many cancer cell lines examined, LOX gene expression is downregulated (25–27). In spontaneous revertants or on induced
phenotypic reversion, higher, normal levels of LOX are seen
(23, 28), and antisense lysyl oxidase causes a return to transformed
phenotype (29). Nuclear runoff transcription assays showed a
marked reduction in synthesis of LOX RNA resulting from Ras
transformation. Potential mechanisms for the down-regulation of
LOX gene expression include inactivation by methylation and loss
of heterozygosity (29).
We have shown that ectopic expression of the precursor ProLOX in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells inhibited the activities
of Akt and ERK kinases and downstream induction of p50/p65
NF-nB (30). Subsequently, the LOX rrg activity was mapped to the

LOX Propeptide Inhibits Lung and Pancreatic Cancers

Figure 1. LOX expression is decreased in lung and pancreatic primary tumors and cell lines. A, LOX mRNA expression analysis in primary lung cancer samples.
Box plots of data from the Garber_lung microarray data set (reporter number IMAGE: 341680) were accessed using the Oncomine Cancer Profiling Database
(http://www.oncomine.org) and are plotted on a log scale (http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/241500798/DC1). The data set includes 6 normal lung samples (Normal )
and 40 lung adenocarcinoma patient samples (Tumor ). Line within the box, median expression value for each group. Top edge of the box, 75th percentile of the
distribution; bottom edge, 25th percentile. The lines (whiskers) emerging from each box extend to the smallest and largest observations; for normal lung tissues, the
line is at the top of the box. Black dots outside the ends of the whiskers, outlier data points. A Student’s t test, done directly through the Oncomine 3.0 software,
showed that the difference in LOX expression between the two groups was significant (P = 0.01). B, LOX mRNA expression analyses from microarray data on lung
cancer cell lines (GEO accession number: GDS89). C, data analysis was done on LOX mRNA expression in 8 primary pancreatic tumor samples (D) and 13 pancreatic

propeptide domain of LOX and not the LOX enzyme (31). LOX-PP
reduced Ras-dependent transformation of NIH 3T3 cells as
determined by effects on proliferation, growth in soft agar, and
the inhibition of the PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway and NF-nB activity
(31). In these studies, we have tested whether the LOX-PP rrg
activity functions in human lung and pancreatic cancer cells that
carry NRAS and KRAS mutations, respectively (and mutant P53
genes). The results show that LOX-PP strongly inhibits RAS
signaling and NF-nB activity. Furthermore, we identify Bcl-2 as
an essential target of LOX-PP–mediated inhibition of transformed
phenotype.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatment conditions. H1299 lung cancer and PANC-1
pancreatic cancer cell lines were kindly provided by Zhi-Xiong Jim Xiao
(Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA) and Edward E. Whang
(Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA), respectively. Cells were
grown as described by the American Type Culture Collection. Where
indicated, cultures of stable H1299 or PANC-1 transfectants/infectants were
treated with 2 Ag/mL doxycycline (Sigma) to induce transgene expression.
DNA constructs and transfection and infection analyses. The cDNA
fragments encoding murine Pro-LOX and LOX-PP containing a COOHterminal V5/His tag were cloned into the retroviral vector pC4bsrR(TO)
containing a doxycycline-inducible promoter or vector pCXbsr, which
contains a constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (generously
provided by Tsuyoshi Akagi, OBI, Osaka, Japan) as described previously
(32). H1299 lung cancer stable lines were established by transfection either
with control pC4bsrR(TO) vector [empty vector (EV)] or with pC4bsrR(TO)Pro-LOX or pC4bsrR(TO)-LOX-PP vector plus the regulator vector

pCXneoTR2. Cells were selected with 10 Ag/mL blasticidin (Invitrogen)
and 600 Ag/mL geneticin (Sigma). Single clones of cells expressing LOX-PP
were isolated by limiting dilution. Because of the low transfection efficiency
of PANC-1 cells, stable lines were prepared by retroviral infection. Retrovirus
stocks were generated by cotransfecting 293T cells with amphotropic (pCL
Ampho) vector (Imgenex) and either EV pC4bsrR(TO) or pC4bsrR(TO)LOX-PP. 293T cells were also transfected with the regulator plasmid
pCXneoTR2. After 48 h, PANC-1 cells were dually infected with filtered
culture supernatant from the 293T cells containing viruses that carry the
regulator vector pCXneoTR2 and effector vector pC4bsrR(TO)-LOX-PP or
empty pC4bsrR(TO) and supplemented with 6 Ag/mL polybrene. Infected
cells were selected with 10 Ag/mL blasticidin and 1.2 mg/mL geneticin to
generate pools of stable infectants of LOX-PP and EV control cells, and
single clones were isolated by limiting dilution.
pBABE-Bcl-2 expression vector and pBABE-EV plasmid were kindly
provided by Stanley Korsmeyer (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;
ref. 33). Bcl-2 stable lines were established by transfection of pBABE-Bcl-2
expression vector and pBABE-EV DNA into PANC-1-LOX-PP and H1299LOX-PP clones and H1299-EV lines and selection with 5 Ag/mL puromycin.
For the NF-nB transactivation assay, a six-copy NF-nB element-driven
luciferase reporter construct (kindly provided by G. Rawadi, Hoechst
Marion Roussel, Romainville, France) was used. CMV-driven LOX-PP
construct or EV DNA was used to transiently transfect PANC-1 cells using
LipofectAMINE 2000. An optimized ratio of 1:10 (10 ng of NF-nB luciferase
reporter DNA and 100 ng of LOX-PP) was used for the transfection. pRL
Renilla DNA (10 ng; Promega) was cotransfected to normalize for
transfection efficiency. Seventy-two hours after transfection, a dual
luciferase reporter assay was done according to the manufacturer’s
instruction (Promega).
Immunoblot analysis. To isolate nuclear proteins, washed cells were
lysed by suspension in ice-cold lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.6),

10 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2] plus DTT, 1% NP40, and protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics) for 15 min. Lysis was verified by
crystal violet staining. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min
at 2,500 rpm at 4jC, and the supernatant was discarded. The nuclear pellets
were washed once in lysis buffer without detergent, and proteins were
extracted in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% sodium
lauryl sarcosine, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L EDTA plus DTT, and
protease inhibitor cocktail as above. The extracts were briefly sonicated,
followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000  g at 4jC, and the
supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was removed. For preparation

of whole-cell protein lysates, cells were incubated in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100] plus protease inhibitor
cocktail and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mmol/L NaPP, 10 mmol/L NaF, and
1 mmol/L Na3VO4). Protein concentrations were determined using the
detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Samples (50 Ag) were
subjected to immunoblotting as described (30). The antibody reagents for
Akt, phosphorylated Akt (Ser473P), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Thr202Tyr204),
and ERK1/2 were obtained from Cell Signaling. Antibodies against h-actin
and V5 epitope were from Sigma and Invitrogen, respectively. Antibodies
against p65, InB-a, and Bcl-2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To
detect expression of recombinant proteins in cell culture medium, 1 or 2 mL
of 10 mL culture medium were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a
V5 antibody (Sigma) and protein A-Sepharose (Invitrogen). Immunoblot
analysis was done using anti-V5 antibody followed by incubation with
protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or goat anti-mouse
IgG conjugated to HRP specific for the Fc fragment.
Soft agar growth assay. Stable cell lines or clones were plated at 5,000
cells per well in 0.35% top agarose (SeaPlaque Agarose, FMC BioProducts)
with a base agarose of 0.7% agarose supplemented with complete medium.
Cultures were treated with 2 Ag/mL doxycycline and incubated in a
humidified incubator at 37jC for 2 weeks. Cells were stained with 0.5 mL of
0.0005% crystal violet, and colonies were counted visually. All experiments
were done in triplicate with two independent experiments.
Matrigel outgrowth assay. Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was diluted to a
concentration of 6.3 mg/mL with serum-free medium (DMEM) and stored
at 80jC. Matrigel was thawed on ice overnight. For the bottom layer,
200 AL of Matrigel solution were added into a 24-well tissue culture plate
and incubated at 37jC for 30 min to allow the Matrigel to solidify. A singlecell suspension (2.5  105 cells/mL) in serum-free medium (DMEM) was
made by passing the cell suspension through a 21-gauge needle five times.
Ten microliters (2,500 cells) were mixed with 190 AL Matrigel and plated, in
duplicate, onto the solidified bottom layer. The plates were incubated at
37jC for 30 min to allow the Matrigel to solidify, and complete medium
with 2 Ag/mL doxycycline was then added. Following incubation at 37jC for
5 to 7 days, cell growth was analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M
microscope. Experiments were done twice with similar results.
Migration assay. Suspensions of 1  105 cells, which had been
pretreated with doxycycline for 24 h, were placed in the upper compartments of Transwells (Costar) on an 8-mm-diameter polycarbonate filter and
incubated at 37jC for 6 h. Migration of the cells to the lower side of the
filter was evaluated with the acid phosphatase enzymatic assay using
p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) and A410nm determination.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted and
purified using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples (5 Ag) were reverse
transcribed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) with
random primers. Amplification of the BCL2 cDNA was done with the
following primers: 5¶-CATTTCCACGTCAACAGAATTG-3¶ ( forward) and
5¶-AGCACAGGATTGGATATTCCAT-3¶ (reverse). The primers used for the

amplification of the control GAPDH are 5¶-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3¶
( forward) and 5¶-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3¶ (reverse). PCR was done in a
thermal cycler for 25 cycles for BCL2 and 16 cycles for GAPDH as follows:
94jC for 30 s, 60jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 30 s.

Results
LOX gene expression is reduced in lung and pancreatic
cancers. To determine whether LOX gene expression is reduced in
lung cancer, we analyzed the microarray data of 40 primary lung
adenocarcinoma samples available on the Oncomine Web site4
versus six normal lung tissue samples. As seen in the resulting box
plot, the levels of LOX mRNA were substantially lower in primary
tumor samples versus the normal tissues (Fig. 1A). A Student’s t test,
done directly through the Oncomine 3.0 software, showed that
the difference in LOX expression between the two groups was
significant (P = 0.01). Additional microarray data on nine lung
cancer cell lines revealed similar findings; all but one have low LOX
mRNA levels (GEO accession number: GDS89; Fig. 1B). Similarly,
analysis of data on 8 primary pancreatic tumor samples and 13
pancreatic cancer cell lines in the Stanford Microarray database5
showed that all have low levels of LOX mRNA expression (Fig. 1C).
LOX-PP inhibits anchorage-independent growth and invasive colony formation by H1299 lung cancer cells. To investigate
whether overexpression of Pro-LOX or LOX-PP will inhibit the
transformed phenotype of H1299 lung cancer cells that carry an
NRAS mutation, we used a doxycycline-inducible system. H1299
cells were cotransfected with vectors that expressed either the fulllength proenzyme Pro-LOX or the propeptide portion of the
precursor (LOX-PP), with COOH-terminal V5 tags or with empty
parental retroviral vector pC4bsrR(TO) (EV) DNA and the regulator
vector pCXneoTR2. Stable lines were derived under dual antibiotic
selection, and single clones for Pro-LOX (H1299-Pro-LOX2 and ProLOX4) and LOX-PP (H1299-LOX-PP4 and LOX-PP7) were isolated
to reduce problems with leaky expression. To verify ectopic
expression of the transgene, whole-cell protein extracts and the
culture medium were isolated 24 h after induction with 2 Ag/mL
doxycycline. Ectopic expression of Pro-LOX was detected in the
extracts of the H1299-Pro-LOX2 and Pro-LOX4 cells by immunoblotting with a V5 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2A). The Pro-LOX
(50 kDa) was efficiently secreted into the medium and processed to
the 32-kDa mature LOX enzyme and the propeptide, which is not
detected due to the loss of the tag. Expression of LOX-PP by the
H1299-LOX-PP4 and LOX-PP7 cells, which is efficiently secreted,
was analyzed in the culture medium by immunoprecipitation with
a V5 antibody followed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2B). The
18-kDa LOX-PP was detected as a band of >25 kDa, presumably due
to N-glycosylation, as seen previously (32, 34).
Having established inducible expression in the H1299 cells, the
effects of Pro-LOX and LOX-PP on growth of H1299 cells in soft
agar, a hallmark of transformed phenotype, were evaluated. Growth
of H1299 cells in soft agar was robust (Fig. 2C). Cells expressing the
EV DNA formed large colonies within 14 days of culture. Ectopic
expression of Pro-LOX or of LOX-PP substantially reduced the
ability of H1299 cells to grow in soft agar; only small colonies were
observed with either H1299-Pro-LOX2 and Pro-LOX4 or H1299LOX-PP4 and LOX-PP7 cells (Fig. 2C). Many highly malignant cells
form colonies with an invasive branching appearance when plated

H1299-EV, H1299-Pro-LOX2, H1299-Pro-LOX4, H1299-LOX-PP4, and
H1299-LOX-PP7 cells were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS in the presence of
doxycycline for 24 h. Whole-cell extracts were prepared and samples

Ser473-phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and total Akt (A ) and phosphorylated
Thr202Tyr204 ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and total ERK1/2 (B). C and D, PANC-1 cells
were infected with retroviral constructs and cells stably integrated with empty
parental control vector (EV ) and LOX-PP DNA were obtained. Two clonal
derivatives were isolated from the PANC-1-LOX-PP cells and these were called
PANC-1-LOX-PP7 and PANC-1-LOX-PP8. C, PANC-1-EV, PANC-1-LOX-PP,
PANC-1-LOX-PP7, and PANC-1-LOX-PP8 cells were incubated in the presence
of doxycycline for 24 h. Samples of cell culture medium (2 mL) were subjected to
immunoprecipitation overnight with a V5 antibody followed by further incubation
with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. Immunoprecipitated LOX-PP proteins were
identified by immunoblot analysis using anti-V5 antibody followed by incubation
with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP specific for the Fc fragment.

and photographed as above; bottom, colony numbers were determined by
counting colonies from three random fields. Columns, percentage colony

in Matrigel. The H1299-EV, H1299-Pro-LOX, and H1299-LOX-PP
cells were seeded in Matrigel and grown in the presence of
doxycycline. After 7 days, H1299 EV cells readily formed branching
outgrowth structures in Matrigel (Fig. 2D). Overexpression of
Pro-LOX or LOX-PP potently abolished this feature of mesenchymal cells, consistent with the activity residing within the LOX-PP
domain (Fig. 2D). Expression of mature 32-kDa LOX, without the
propeptide region, was unable to inhibit either growth in soft agar
or branching colony formation in Matrigel (data not shown). Thus,
LOX-PP reduces anchorage-independent growth and invasive
colony formation of these lung cancer cells.
LOX-PP inhibits RAS signaling pathways in lung cancer
cells. The Akt and ERK kinases are two major mediators of RAS
signaling. To examine whether expression of Pro-LOX and LOX-PP
affects activation of Akt and ERK in H1299 cells, immunoblotting
for the active form of Akt and ERK proteins was done using
phospho-specific antibodies. Cells were treated with doxycycline
for 24 h and whole-cell protein extracts were analyzed for levels of
phospho-specific Akt and ERK. Overexpression of either Pro-LOX
or LOX-PP potently reduced activation of Akt and ERK (Fig. 3A
and B). Antibodies against Akt and ERK confirmed essentially equal
protein loading. Thus, Pro-LOX and LOX-PP potently inhibit RAS
signaling via the Akt and ERK pathways. Furthermore, rrg activity
resides within the propeptide domain and was selected for
experiments with the pancreatic cancer cells.
LOX-PP reduces RAS-mediated transformation of pancreatic
cancer cells. Given that LOX gene expression is consistently
reduced in pancreatic cancers (Fig. 1C), which are frequently driven
by RAS mutations, we next evaluated the effects of LOX-PP expression
on PANC-1 cells, which carry a KRAS mutation and express low level
of the LOX gene product.5 PANC-1 cells were infected with empty
pC4bsrR(TO) retroviral DNA (EV) or the retroviral vector carrying
LOX-PP [pC4bsrR(TO)-LOX-PP]. A mixed population expressing
LOX-PP was selected (PANC-1-LOX-PP) from which two stable clones
(PANC-1-LOX-PP7 and PANC-1-LOX-PP8) were isolated to obtain a
higher level of expression. Levels of ectopic LOX-PP expression in the
mixed population and in the two LOX-PP clones were analyzed using
immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting of cell medium
(Fig. 3C). The expression of LOX-PP in the two clones was higher
compared with the mixed population.
To evaluate whether LOX-PP can overcome the transforming
ability of oncogenic RAS signaling in PANC-1 cells, soft agar growth
and cell migration assays were done. For soft agar growth assays, the
mixed population and clonal derivatives of cells expressing LOX-PP
and control EV cells were plated at the density of 5,000 cells per well
in a six-well plate and treated with doxycycline. Whereas PANC-1EV cells readily formed large colonies (Fig. 3D, top), expression of
LOX-PP in the two PANC-1-LOX-PP clones almost completely
inhibited colony formation, and a substantial decrease in colony
number was also observed with the mixed population LOX-PP cells
(Fig. 3D, bottom). The individual clones were selected for further
study. For migration assays, suspension of 1  105 PANC-1-EV,
PANC-1-LOX-PP7, and PANC-1-LOX-PP8 cells was placed in the
upper compartments of Transwells and incubated at 37jC for
6 h (Fig. 4A). Expression of LOX-PP significantly reduced the ability
of PANC-1 cells to migrate compared with the control cells.
We next examined the activity of two major downstream
effectors Akt and ERK. Induction of LOX-PP expression in PANC-1
cells caused a moderate drop in the phosphorylated Akt and a
more profound decrease in phosphorylated ERK levels (Fig. 4B).
Similar results were obtained when cells were serum deprived

photographed as in the legend of Fig. 3D ; bottom, colony numbers were determined by counting three random fields. Columns, percentage colony formation compared

[0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS)] in doxycycline-supplemented
medium for 48 h and then stimulated with fresh medium with 10%
FBS for 1.5 h (data not shown). Thus, LOX-PP effectively reduces
the activity of two major RAS signaling mediators Akt and ERK
and reverses the transformed phenotype of pancreatic PANC-1
cancer cells.
LOX-PP down-regulates NF-KB in PANC-1 cells. As constitutive activation of the p65 (RelA) NF-nB subunit is implicated in
f70% of pancreatic cancers and serves as a downstream effector
for the Akt and ERK pathways (13, 14, 35), we examined the effects
of LOX-PP expression on the p65 NF-nB subunit as well as on its
inhibitory protein InB-a. Nuclear protein extracts or whole-cell
protein extracts were prepared separately from the same cell
sample that had been treated with doxycycline for 24 h and subjected to immunoblot analysis. A substantial reduction in nuclear
levels of p65 was observed in response to overexpression of LOX-PP
(Fig. 4C). Concomitantly, there was an induction in the InB-a
protein levels in the whole-cell protein extracts (Fig. 4C).
Furthermore, ectopic expression of LOX-PP in PANC-1 cells reduced
NF-nB element-driven promoter activity by f73% (Fig. 4D), which
correlated with the decrease in p65 levels. Together, these data
indicate that ectopic LOX-PP potently inhibits both expression and
activity of NF-nB, an important mediator of RAS signaling.
Bcl-2 is an essential target for LOX-PP signaling in
pancreatic and lung cancer cells. Bcl-2, the product of a
tissue-specific NF-nB target gene, is elevated in f75% of
pancreatic cancers (13, 16). Thus, the effects of LOX-PP on Bcl-2

expression were examined. LOX-PP potently reduced levels of Bcl-2
protein and BCL2 RNA as judged by immunoblotting and reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses, respectively (Fig. 4C). Recent
studies have implicated Bcl-2 as playing a role in promoting
transformed phenotype as well as cell survival (36–38). To
investigate whether reintroduction of Bcl-2 into LOX-PP cells
would overcome LOX-PP rrg activity, the Bcl-2 expression vector
pBABE-Bcl-2 and control pBABE-EV plasmid DNAs were transfected into the PANC-1-LOX-PP clones and control PANC-1-EV
cells. Stable transfectants were selected and overexpression of Bcl-2
was confirmed (Fig. 5A). Ectopic Bcl-2 expression significantly
restored the ability of PANC-1-LOX-PP cells to grow in soft agar
(Fig. 5B) and enhanced their ability to migrate (Fig. 5C). Ectopic
Bcl-2 expression did not seem to affect cells with EV in terms of
either the number of colonies formed in soft agar or the ability of
the cells to migrate (Fig. 5B and C).
To determine whether the effects on Bcl-2 could be extended to
lung cancer cells, we first tested the H1299-EV control cells and
H1299-LOX-PP4 and LOX-PP7 clones for effects of LOX-PP on
expression of the p65 NF-nB subunit and Bcl-2. LOX-PP expression
in H1299 cells similarly caused a reduction in these two proteins
(Fig. 6A). We then asked whether ectopic expression of Bcl-2
restored the ability of these cells to form invasive colonies in
Matrigel (Fig. 6B). An essentially complete reversion of invasive
colony formation was seen upon ectopic Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 6C).
Thus, Bcl-2 is an essential target for the antitransforming ability of
LOX-PP.

Discussion
Here, we show, for the first time, the ability of the propeptide
of lysyl oxidase to overcome RAS signaling and transformation of
lung and pancreatic cancer cells that harbor RAS mutations and
identify Bcl-2 as an essential downstream target of LOX-PP. In
H1299 cells, which carry an NRAS mutation, LOX-PP potently
inhibited activation of Akt and ERK, two of the major effectors of
RAS signaling, growth in soft agar, and invasive colony formation
in Matrigel. Similarly, LOX-PP decreased RAS-induced signaling
and the transformed phenotype of PANC-1 pancreatic cancer
cells, which carry a KRAS mutation, as judged by Akt and ERK
activity, decreased ability to grow in soft agar or to migrate. In
both cells, LOX-PP reduced levels of p65 NF-nB and Bcl-2.
Recently, we showed that ectopic expression of LOX-PP effectively
inhibited Her-2/neu signaling, an upstream activator of Ras in
mouse breast carcinoma cells (32). It is also noteworthy that both
H1299 and PANC-1 cells are p53 deficient. More than 50% of all
human cancers bear P53 mutations, and this deficiency renders
them greatly resistant to different means of therapy, including
chemotherapy and irradiation (39–42). Thus, the LOX-PP ability to
overcome RAS-mediated transformation in the absence of a

promotes a less invasive phenotype. A, H1299-EV, H1299-LOX-PP4, and
H1299-LOX-PP7 cells were incubated in the presence of doxycycline for 24 h.
Nuclear extracts (30 Ag protein) were subjected to immunoblotting for the p65
subunit of NF-nB and for h-actin (top ) and whole-cell protein extracts (50 Ag) for
Bcl-2 and h-actin (bottom ). B and C, H1299-EV, H1299-LOX-PP4, and
H1299-LOX-PP7 cells were transfected with the Bcl-2 expression vector
pBABE-Bcl-2 (+, Bcl-2) or with control vector pBABE-EV ( , Bcl-2). B, 48 h after
transfection, cells were replated and cultured overnight. Whole-cell protein
extracts (50 Ag) were subjected to immunoblotting for Bcl-2 and h-actin.
C, alternatively, cells (2,500 per well) were subjected to a Matrigel outgrowth
assay and photographed after 6 d.

functional p53 and in the presence of a mutant Ras protein
suggests further investigation of the therapeutic potential of LOXPP is warranted.
Aberrant activation of NF-nB factors typifies many primary
cancers. Constitutive activation of the p65 NF-nB subunit was
found in 70% of human pancreatic adenocarcinomas and human
pancreatic cancer cell lines but not in immortalized, nontumorigenic pancreatic epithelial cells or normal pancreatic tissue (13, 14,
35, 43). Evidence indicates that the aberrant activation of NF-nB
contributes to pancreatic tumorigenesis (15, 35, 43, 44). As a
multifaceted regulator, NF-nB controls a network of important
proteins that increase metastasis and protect cancer cells from
apoptosis (8, 9, 12, 45). Importantly, many of NF-nB–induced genes
are important drug targets in cancer therapeutic strategies (12),
including Bcl-2. Interestingly, LOX-PP caused comparable
decreases in p65 protein levels in whole-cell and nuclear extract
(data not shown). This implies that the NF-nB regulation mediated
by LOX-PP is not simply due to the sequestration in the cytoplasm
as seen conventionally.
Here, we identify Bcl-2 as an essential target for LOX-PP
antitransformation signaling. LOX-PP potently down-regulated
Bcl-2 protein in PANC-1 and H1299 cells. Recent studies have
linked Bcl-2 to invasive properties and metastasis of tumors
(36, 37). Expression of Bcl-2 in breast cancer cells strikingly
increased their ability to metastasize to the lung upon injection
into nude mice (46). Our data show that overexpression of Bcl-2
potently promotes cell migration, growth in soft agar of PANC-1LOX-PP cells, and invasive phenotype of H1299-LOX-PP clones.
Importantly, BCL2-mediated transformation occurred only in
LOX-PP cells, but not in EV cells, implying that Bcl-2 is an
essential target of LOX-PP, and resumption of Bcl-2 expression is
capable of overcoming the rrg activity of LOX-PP. Two major
mechanisms regulate Bcl-2 levels: (a) control of BCL2 gene
transcription, mediated by several transcription factors, including
NF-nB, and (b) ubiquitin-dependent degradation mediated by
MAPK. Although changes in BCL2 mRNA levels were observed, to
date, we have been unable to find evidence for regulation of Bcl-2
protein stability. LOX-PP failed to alter ubiquitination of Bcl-2
when a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin was expressed and
immunoprecipitation with HA antibody was followed by immunoblot analysis for Bcl-2 (data not shown). These results suggest
that LOX-PP–mediated signaling events may exert control of
BCL2 gene transcription. Lastly, addition of the general caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk had only modest effects on colony formation
by either H1299 or PANC-1 cells following induction of LOX-PP
(data not shown), indicating the propeptide does not induce
significant levels of anoikis. In summary, LOX-PP significantly
inhibits transformed phenotype of both pancreatic and lung
cancer cells that bear mutant RAS and P53 genes. Thus, LOX-PP
may be useful in novel therapeutic strategies for cancer
treatment.
