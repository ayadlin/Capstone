Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cancer genome sequencing has revealed considerable variation in somatic mutation rates across
the human genome, with mutation rates elevated in heterochromatic late replicating regions and
reduced in early replicating euchromatin1-5. Multiple mechanisms have been suggested to underlie
this2,6-10, but the actual cause is unknown. Here we identify variable DNA mismatch repair
(MMR) as the basis of this variation. Analysing ~17 million single nucleotide variants from the
genomes of 652 tumours, we show that regional autosomal mutation rates at megabase resolution
are largely stable across cancer types, with differences related to changes in replication timing and
gene expression. However, mutations arising after the inactivation of MMR are no longer enriched
in early replicating euchromatin relative to late replicating heterochromatin. Thus, differential
DNA repair and not differential mutation supply is the primary cause of the large-scale regional
mutation rate variation across the human genome.
We examined 1Mb mutation densities along 652 fully sequenced human cancer genomes
with >3000 SNVs (single nucleotide variants) per genome, originating from 16 tissues. This
threshold enables more robust estimates of regional SNV densities in the examined samples,
but it excludes cancer types with a very low mutation burden (Methods). Despite vastly
different mutational loads between tissues of origin and between individual tumours11, the
relative regional densities were, overall, consistent between samples. In a principal
components (PC) analysis, the first PC corresponds closely to the average densities over all
samples (R2=0.99) and captures 86.2% of the non-random variability between the 1Mb
windows (Fig. 1a-c). This estimate of baseline variability per PC (Methods) encompasses
the non-biological sources of randomness in the data (e.g. low mutation counts per bin in
some cancer types) but it may also include genuine biological variability, if it is particular to

individual tumour genomes. The second most prominent PCA trend (PC2, 5.9% variability;
Fig 1a, d) precisely captures the known hypermutation of the X chromosome in a subset of
tumours12. Across the 652 tumours, we estimate a further 7.9% of non-random variability
exists that is not explained by the general pattern of regional rates or by the hypermutation
of X (in PC3-8, with 4.4% in PC3 only; Fig. 1a, b).

This signal can, in part, be ascribed to tissue-specific mutation rates: cancer samples from
7/16 tissues were significantly shifted in the distribution of their PC3 loadings (MannWhitney test, FDR<1%). Liver, colorectal and B-lymphocyte tumours were differentiated by
lower PC3 loading scores, whereas melanoma, breast, ovarian and lung tumours had higher
PC3 loadings (tissues highlighted in Fig. 1e). To examine if these significant regional rate
changes are associated to DNA replication timing changes, we used RepliSeq data from
ENCODE cell lines as a proxy for the changes occurring in the cancers of the corresponding
tissues. In all cases, the correlation of the cell line-specific RepliSeq signal to the cancer
type-specific 1Mb mutation rates was most prominent in the cancer type matching the cell
line, with a significant difference from the non-matching cancer types (FDR<10%, Fig. 1f).
Similarly, the changes in average gene expression levels in 1Mb windows in tumour
samples paralleled the changes in mutation rates in the same samples with significantly
stronger correlations for the matching cancer type (FDR<10%, Fig 1g; example in Extended
Data Fig. 1a, b).

Visualizing the cancer samples in a PC plot revealed a group of outliers in a low-density
area of the plot with extreme PC3 and PC4 loadings (box in Fig. 1e). These samples derive
almost exclusively from colorectal, stomach or uterine cancers even though most samples
from these three cancer types clustered elsewhere on the PC plot. One feature particular to
tumours from these three tissues is that they frequently display inactivation of the mismatch
repair (MMR) pathway through mutation of MMR genes or hypermethylation of the MLH1
gene promoter13-15. Inactivation of MMR results in a high incidence of small insertions and
deletions (indels) at simple sequence repeats - referred to as microsatellite instability (MSI)
and used to phenotypically identify MMR deficiency - but also an increased SNV load
(Extended Data Fig. 1c).
The outlier colon, gastric and uterine cancer samples on the PC plot (Fig. 1e, Extended Data
Fig. 1d) were almost always MSI samples (phenotypically scored as MSI-high, MSI-H),
suggesting MMR deficiency as the cause of their unusual regional mutation rate variation.
To understand how the regional mutation rate differs in these samples, we plotted their
mutation densities along the genome. The regional rate variation was substantially decreased
in these tumours compared to in other microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumours from the same
tissues (Fig. 2a-c). The change towards more homogeneous mutation rates in MSI cancers
was significant across many chromosomal regions, with ~72% of the genome being affected
(1977/2748 1Mb windows, Mann-Whitney test on pooled tissues, 10% FDR; examples in
Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 1e, f). Consistently, the regional rates in MSI cancers from
all three tissues correlate poorly to replication timing (Fig. 2e-g), gene expression levels and
heterochromatin (Extended Data Fig. 2a-f). Moreover, the slopes of the regression lines
between binned replication timing and SNV rates revealed consistent changes in MSI cancer
samples when calculated separately for intergenic and for genic (intronic) DNA in the whole

genome sequences (Fig. 2h, i). Very similar trends were observed in a broader set of 950
exome sequences of colorectal, uterine and gastric cancers (Extended Data Fig. 2g-j).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

High mutation rates in uterine and colorectal cancers can also be caused by inactivation of
the proofreading domain of DNA polymerase epsilon13,14 (PolE). Proofreading is a result of
a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity that enhances the accuracy of PolE by excising incorrectly
placed nucleotides during synthesis. MSS PolE tumours exhibited a significantly larger
spread of the regional SNV density distribution than MSI tumours (Fig. 2a, b), even though
their mutational load is typically higher (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Similar conclusions are
reached with stomach cancer15 hypermutators of unknown aetiology (Fig. 2c). Thus,
increased mutation supply does not explain the loss of regional mutation rate variability in
MSI cancers.
The relative frequencies of 5′ and 3′ contexts of different SNVs - the mutation spectrum are informative of the mutational processes operative in a particular cancer type16. We
observed the previously-reported17 signatures of MMR-deficiency in MSI cancers: C>T
transitions in a NpCpG sequence context and C>A transversions at CpCpC (all mutations
considered strand-symmetrically). In addition, we report a general increase in the relative
frequency of transitions in MSI genomes, wherein A>G increases preferentially when
preceded or followed by a C, and C>T clearly increases most in the GpCpN context
(Extended Data Fig. 3a).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We examined how the different mutation spectra are distributed across the genome in MSI
samples. The signatures most characteristic of MMR-deficiency had a considerably flatter
distribution in MSI tumours than in MSS or PolE-mutated tumours whereas this was less the
case for signatures not associated with MMR-deficiency (Fig. 3a, b; Extended Data Figure
3b, c). Indeed, the more abundant a mutational context becomes specifically in MSI
tumours, the more uniformly it is distributed with respect to replication timing in MSI
samples (Fig. 3c, R2=0.45, P<10−6) but not in MSS samples (Extended Data Fig. 3d,
R2=0.01).
Notably, however, many signatures not associated with MMR-deficiency do flatten to some
extent in MSI tumours. This suggests that the residual correlation to replication timing in
MSI cancers (Fig. 2e-g) might derive purely from the mutations originating prior to MMR
inactivation. To test this idea, we used the proportion of mutations in MSI-associated
contexts to sort the MSI samples by the proportion of their history spent in a MMR-deficient
state (Methods). The proportion of mutations in MSI-associated contexts significantly
correlates to how flat the overall regional rates are with respect to replication timing in each
sample (Fig. 3d, R2=0.37, P=0.0017). Importantly, this is also true for mutations in contexts
that increase little or decrease in relative frequency in MSI genomes: all transversions
(excluding C>A in CCN) and the transitions A>G in AAN and C>T in TCN (Fig. 3e,
Extended Data Fig. 3e, f; R2=0.38-0.45, P<0.0015). Thus, the greater the proportion of its
history a tumour has spent in a MMR-deficient state, the flatter its distribution of mutations
across the genome and this flattening is observed for mutations in both MSI-associated and
non MSI-associated contexts.

To more precisely quantify the contribution of MMR to the observed regional mutation
variation across the genome, we next estimated the time spent in the MMR-proficient and
MMR-deficient states in each individual tumour. We used a simple model that assumes that
genome-wide mutation rates for each mutational context are equal across samples but
allowing a distinct rate for each context in the MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient states
(schematic in Fig. 4a, b). We employed a genetic algorithm-based optimization that
minimizes the difference to observed mutational signatures (Methods). After fitting a global
set of rate parameters, this simple model captures 68% of the variance in differential
mutational context usage across the MSI and a set of MSS cancer samples from all three
MSI-prone cancer types (Extended Data Fig. 4). Importantly, the de-convolution
recapitulated the known consequences of MMR deficiency on the mutational spectrum and
the MSI status of each sample (Fig. 4c, d).
The model shows that the earlier MMR fails in the history of a tumour, the flatter its
regional rate landscape is with respect to replication timing (Fig. 4e, R2=0.54, P<10−4;
examples in Fig. 4f). Indeed the inferred time of MMR failure predicts the loss of regional
rate variability better than a simple proportion of mutations in MSI-prone contexts (R2=0.37,
in Fig. 3d). In addition, the 99% confidence interval of a linear fit to the points in Fig. 4e
crosses the horizontal zero line - corresponding to a fully flat regional landscape - prior to
the point where all mutations are predicted to have arrived in the MMR-deficient state. This
indicates that the mutations that arose after the inactivation of MMR in these tumours are
not distributed with the characteristic regional variation across the genome. In the absence of
MMR, mutation rates are not reduced in early replicating euchromatic regions compared to
in late replicating heterochromatin.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

In summary, through an analysis of human tumours we have shown that MMR is more
effective in euchromatic early-replicating regions of the human genome and that this
suppresses the accumulation of mutations in these regions. MMR is known to be coupled to
DNA replication, with elevated repair efficiency during S-phase18,19. Differences in DNA
accessibility to the repair machinery20-22, the coupling of this machinery to the replication
fork, or the time available for repair might contribute to the increased efficiency of repair in
early replicating euchromatin. Across cell types, most active genes performing essential
functions are euchromatic and replicated early23-25. It is thus sensible to envisage that
enhanced MMR in euchromatin is a beneficial trait and one that has been selected for during
evolution.

Methods
TCGA genomes, calling somatic mutations
We downloaded aligned short reads (to hg19/GRCh37) for the available whole-genome
sequences of tumours (n=630) and the matched normal tissue from the TCGA repository at
CGHub. We then called somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in each tumour-normal
pair using Illumina’s Strelka 1.0.6 workflow26. Strelka is a highly accurate caller, with a low
false positive rate of SNVs at the default settings27,28. We further increased the stringency
of Strelka’s post-call filtering to prevent spurious mutation calls. By default Strelka requires
that the overall confidence score (QSS_NT) is ≥15, that the fraction of filtered basecalls at

the site (BCNoise) is <40%, and also that the fraction of reads crossing site with spanning
deletions (SpanDel) is <75%. Here, we allow very few filtered or gapped reads at the site:
BCNoise and SpanDel must both be <3% for the tumour sample and <10% for the normal
tissue. Exceptionally, for extremely high confidence calls (QSS_NT≥45), BCNoise for the
tumour sample may be <6%. For TCGA leukaemia (LAML), we downloaded the called
somatic SNVs from the corresponding publication29 (n=50 samples).
Other whole genome sequences
We downloaded the previously called somatic SNVs for whole genome sequences (n=507)
from the online supplementary material of Alexandrov et al.16; these samples did not
overlap the TCGA dataset. Next, we downloaded the somatic SNVs from the whole genome
sequences in the ICGC v15.1 database, in case the same genome sets were not already
available in Alexandrov et al. or TCGA; this encompasses the ICGC projects RECA-EU,
MALY-DE and EOPC-DE (n=150 genomes). Finally, we removed all samples of B-cell
lymphoma from the Alexandrov et al. set due to a suspected partial overlap with a broader
set in ICGC MALY-DE.
Filtering and dividing the genome into 1Mb windows

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To rule out errors due to misalignment of short reads, we masked out all regions in the
genome defined in the “CRG Alignability 36” track30, requiring a 36-mer to be unique in the
genome even after allowing for two differing nucleotides. Next, we masked out the regions
in the UCSC Browser blacklists (Duke and DAC), chosen for often exhibiting anomalous
signal in next-generation sequencing experiments (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/
hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeMapability). Finally, we discarded the exons (plus flanking 2nt) of
the UCSC gene set to avoid the signal stemming from selection on gene coding regions.
Then we divided the genome into non-overlapping 1Mb windows and discarded those with
<250 kb of DNA passing the above filters; we also exclude the remaining windows on
chromosome Y (n=7) as RepliSeq data was not available for them (see below). This yielded
2748 1Mb windows with an average of 664 kb highly alignable, non-blacklisted, non-exonic
DNA per window. When determining SNV densities, the SNV counts in each window were
divided by its effective length (after masking) to obtain frequencies per MB. The choice of
1Mb resolution is a trade-off between inclusion of low mutation burden tumour samples/
types (better with coarser resolution) and the level of detail in describing the regional
variability (better with finer resolution). Furthermore, replication timing is known to be
organized in megabase-scale domains23,25.
Conditions for inclusion in the final genome set
We merged the three sets of genomes (TCGA, Alexandrov et al. and ICGC) and discarded
the genomes that had less than 3000 SNVs in the alignable regions of the genome in order to
obtain more reliable regional mutation density estimates. This filter will completely remove
the cancer types with very low SNV loads, such as TCGA thyroid, prostate, leukaemia, or
kidney chromophobe. We also removed four cancer types represented by only a single
genome with ≥3000 SNVs (LGG in TCGA, ALL and medulloblastoma in Alexandrov et al.,
and EOPC-DE in ICGC). Three TCGA uterine cancer UCEC genomes (AP-A0L0, B5-

consistent with known artefacts arising due to 8-oxoG in oxidized DNA samples31 and were
thus excluded, arriving to a final set of 652 genomes and 16,962,503 SNVs in the alignable,
non-blacklisted, non-exonic regions of said genomes (data sources listed in Supplementary
Information Table 1).

Microsatellite instability status of samples
The MSI-H, MSI-L or MSS status were taken from the clinical data files on the TCGA FTP
site repository, named nationwidechildrens.org_clinical_patient_xxxx.txt or
nationwidechildrens.org_auxiliary_xxxx.txt, where xxxx is one of coad, read, stad, or ucec,
corresponding to colon, rectal, stomach or uterine cancer. The methods used for PCR
phenotyping are described in the corresponding TCGA publications13-15. Given previous
reports stating that MSI-L samples are much more similar to MSS than to MSI-H in clinical
and genomic features32,33, we grouped MSI-L with MSS in all analyses.
For 10 (of 64) colorectal cancers with the whole-genome sequence available, the MSI
annotations were not supplied in the TCGA and we thus inferred them from them from the
overall load of somatic SNVs and introns called by Strelka (see above). In particular, ADA5EJ and QG-A5Z2 were putatively labelled as MSI tumours (both having >15k small
indels and >40k SNVs) and QG-A5YW, QG-A5YX, A6-A56B, QG-A5YV, A6-A566, QGA5Z1, A6-A567 and A6-A565 were putative MSS tumours (all with <1.5k small indels and
<15k SNVs). In case of uterine and stomach cancers, all samples with whole genome
sequences were assigned a MSI/MSS label by the TCGA.
MSI and MSS polymerase ε (PolE) mutants

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The PolE status of samples was inferred by requiring a nonsynonymous somatic mutation
called in the PolE gene. Consistent with previous reports32, the MSI tumours with a PolE
mutation have an overall mutational load similar to MSI PolE w.t. samples, unlike the PolE
mutated MSS samples which are ultramutated13,14. We thus grouped the MSI PolE mutants
with MSI PolE w.t. samples, except in the case of 2 (out of 3) MSI PolE mutants in uterine
cancer (UCEC: AX-A0J1 and AP-A051). These samples had a much higher mutational load
than other MSI UCEC samples (leftmost UCEC columns in Extended Data Fig. 1c).
Moreover, they also had a mutational signature not consistent with other MSI - in particular,
the relative abundance of A>G transitions was low in these samples (11% and 13%), much
less than in 10 other UCEC MSI (avg. 34%, range: 23-60%). We thus omitted these two
MSI+PolE UCEC samples from all analyses that involved examining mutational signatures
(corresponding to Fig. 3 and 4, and Extended Data Fig. 3 and 4), thus forming the set of 24
MSI samples used therein, of which 10 CRAD, 10 UCEC and 4 STAD.
Cancer exome sequences
The called somatic mutations from exome sequencing (MAF files) was downloaded from
the TCGA for the COAD/READ (=CRAD), UCEC and STAD cancer types in October
2014. For each tumour sample (TCGA patient), we selected the newest available MAF that
had mutation data for that sample, and we did not load further mutation data for that sample
from other MAFs (files listed in Supplementary Information Table 1). Next, we assigned

MSI-H, MSI-L or MSS status of the exomes from the same data sources used for the whole
genomes (see above) and discarded samples where the MSI status was not known. This left
950 samples, of which 195 MSI-H, and the rest MSS or MSI-L (pooled together). PolE
status was not inferred for exomes. The genomic mask for the exome analysis was
constructed differently than for whole genomes: we similarly used the “CRG Alignability
36” filter and the two UCSC blacklists. However, we excluded all DNA except the protein
coding exons (but not exons of commonly mutated cancer genes, which were also excluded).
Finally, we retained only the 1Mb windows with at least 5 kb of alignable, non-backlisted
exonic DNA. This reduced the initial set of 2748 windows (for the whole genome analysis)
to a 1709 windows for the exome analysis. Density of mutations was expressed per Mb of
available DNA in each window, and again normalised by dividing by the average of all
windows in a sample. For the analysis where we considered each exome separately
(Extended Data Fig. 2j), we limited the analysis to exomes with ≥50 SNVs in the selected
genomic windows.
Gene expression data
The expression levels in tumours were downloaded from the TCGA RnaSeqV2 data sets34
where they are expressed as TPM (transcript-per-million35) values for each gene. For 15
TCGA cancer types that had RnaSeqV2 data available, we downloaded TPM levels for
those tumour samples where we had called whole-genome somatic SNVs, in total 8-92
RnaSeqV2 samples per cancer type (average=29). The TPM levels of genes overlapping
(incl. partially) each 1Mb window were averaged for a tumour sample, and we then
averaged over all samples of each cancer type to get the final expression level for that 1Mb
window in that cancer type; if lower than 0.01 TPM, it was adjusted to 0.01 TPM. The
overall, cross-tissue 1Mb expression levels (in Extended Data Fig. 2a-c) are then the
medians across 15 cancer types.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The “tissue specificity” (TS) of gene expression of 1Mb windows for a particular cancer
type (in Fig. 1g) is the log2 ratio of TPM in that cancer type and the average TPM across all
cancer types. In comparing the TS of gene expression to TS of mutation rates, we limited the
analyses to the 2442/2748 1Mb windows that were at least somewhat expressed (>0.01
TPM) in at least one examined cancer type. Moreover, we excluded chromosome Y for
consistent treatment with the replication timing TS analysis (see below). Finally, we
considered only the 8 cancer types (7 tissues) with significant shifts in the PC3 of regional
mutation rates.
Replication timing data
We downloaded the RepliSeq measurements36 (as wavelet-smoothed signal37) of ENCODE
cell lines from the UCSC Genome Browser (also available in NCBI GEO as GSE34399). To
avoid biasing the sample, we excluded multiple lymphoblastoid cell lines and retained
Gm12878 as a representative. We computed the average RepliSeq signal within 1Mb
genome windows of the remaining 11 cell lines, except chromosome Y which was
unavailable in the original data. The resulting values ranged from 0-100, where higher
values indicate earlier replication. The overall, cross-tissue replication timing signal (used

for genome binning in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Extended Data Figs 2 and 3) is the median value
across the 11 cell lines.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The “tissue specificity” (TS) of replication timing in a cell line (in Fig. 1f) is the difference
between the RepliSeq signal of that cell line and the average signal across all cell lines. For
the TS analysis, we considered those cell lines that (i) could be matched to a cancer type,
based on their tissue of origin and that (ii) corresponded to one of the 8 cancer types found
to have a significant shift in PC3 of the regional mutation rates (Fig. 1e). In particular,
replication timing TS in MCF7 cells served as a proxy for BRCA (breast cancer), BJ cells
for SKCM (melanoma), IMR-90 cells for LUSC/LUAD (lung cancers), HEP G2 cells for
LIHC (liver cancer) and Gm12878 for DLBC (lymphoma). For consistency with the gene
expression TS analyses, we considered the same set of 1Mb windows (see above) in the
replication timing TS analysis.
Heterochromatin data
We downloaded RoadMap epigenomics H3K9me3 ChIP-seq signal for a diverse set of
healthy tissues or cell lines from NCBI GEO, encompassing: GSM621651 (adult kidney),
GSM537710 (adult liver), GSM670028 (mesenchymal stem cells), GSM772917 (CD4
naïve), GSM669939 (fetal lung), GSM450266 (H1 cell line), GSM521914 (IMR90 cell
line). In addition, we include the H3K9me3 levels from Barski et al.38 that were previously
shown to have a strong correlation to regional mutation rates in cancer2. We calculated the
mean H3K9me3 signal in 1Mb windows for each sample and trimmed the distribution at the
99.9th percentile. Then we log-transformed the values and found the median over 8 tissues/
cell lines to get the overall H3K9me3 levels used for binning (in Extended Data Fig. 2d-f).
Slopes over genomic bins

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We used the overall, cross-tissue RepliSeq signal to create five equal-frequency (same
number of 1Mb windows) genome bins for further analyses. Additional sets of bins were
created also for the gene expression and for the heterochromatin signal (Extended Data Fig.
2a-f). The slope of a regression line fitted through the average 1Mb relative mutation rates
of each bin is measure of association of mutation rates to replication timing (Figs 2-4). This
measure has the desirable property of being robust to differences in the overall mutation
load between smaller groups of tumour samples or individual genomes, or between
mutational signatures.
For the analysis where intergenic and genic regions were examined separately in MSI and
MSS cancers, we used the UCSC gene set to define these regions. Since the gene exons had
already been excluded in a genome preprocessing step, the genic regions effectively consist
only of introns. Only for the purposes of this intergenic vs. genic analysis, we relaxed the
requirement of ≥250 kb (of total alignable DNA) per 1Mb window to ≥100 kb (either
intronic or intergenic) alignable DNA per 1Mb. When calculating relative mutation rates,
regardless if analyzing intergenic or intronic mutations, each sample was always normalised
by dividing by the mean of the aggregate (intergenic plus intronic DNA) SNVs rates across
all its windows. The five RepliSeq bins were the same as in the whole-genome analysis.

Statistical analysis – general

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed in R 3.1.1 (R Core Team, Vienna,
Austria) and in XLStat 2014.2 (Addinsoft, Paris, France) on the relative 1Mb mutation rates
of each tumour sample, where samples were features (columns in data table), and 1Mb
windows were examples (rows). To find the relative rates, first the SNV densities per Mb of
alignable, non-exonic, non-blacklisted DNA (see above) were determined for each 1Mb
window in every tumour sample. Then, these densities in each sample were normalised by
dividing by the mean SNV density of all windows in that sample. Thus, the relative mutation
frequencies >1 correspond to above-average SNV densities in a tumour sample, and <1 to
below-average densities. The approximate 95% confidence intervals of the median (across
tumour samples: Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 1e, f) for the 1Mb windows were estimated
using the formula ±1.58*IQR/sqrt(n_samp), as defined in the R function boxplot.stats and
references therein. In the PCA, the tumour samples were features (columns) and the 1Mb
windows were examples (rows); therefore, the PCs will be linear combinations of tumour
samples, and the loadings of the samples on PCs 3 and 4 are shown in Fig. 1e. The expected
(baseline) percent variance in each PC stemming from noise in data was estimated using the
‘broken stick’ method, found to outperform related approaches39. The cancer types were
tested for shifts in PC3 loadings using a Mann-Whitney test (two-tailed) where the loadings
of samples in one cancer type were contrasted to the loadings of samples in all other types.
Mutational signatures – general

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

As in previous work16, the mutational signatures are defined as relative frequencies of SNVs
at different nucleotides in all possible 5′ and 3′ nucleotide contexts. The mutations are
counted strand-symmetrically, thus six possible changes exist: C>G, C>A, C>T, A>T, A>C
and A>G. These are equivalent, respectively, to: G>C, G>T, G>A, T>A, T>G and T>C.
Each of the 6 changes has four possible 5′ and four 3′ neighbouring nucleotides, which
amounts to 6×4×4=96 contexts. Extended Data Fig. 3a shows their relative usage, as % of
SNVs observed in each context. The MSI propensities of contexts (in Fig. 3 and Extended
Data Fig. 3) were defined as the log2 ratio of the absolute mutation frequency (per MB) of a
context in the MSI samples to its mutation frequency in the MSS samples.
DNA word frequencies are not necessarily equally frequently occurring in genomes; for
instance, the CpG dinucleotide is rare. Moreover, they may vary in frequency across the
genome, as is most evident in the global G+C content variation. The outcome of analyses
that compare how mutational context usage co-varies with replication timing (Figs 3 and 4,
Extended Data Figs 3 and 4) may be affected by this. Therefore, we normalised the mutation
frequencies in different contexts by dividing each by the number of corresponding
nucleotides-at-risk in each 1MB window (only nucleotides passing the alignability mask
described above). On data normalised thusly, we determined the strength of association to
replication timing via the slope of the line fitted to RepliSeq bins, as described above. (Of
note, as with the full set of mutations, here also all 1Mb windows values were divided by the
genome average prior to binning.) In case different contexts needed to be combined, the
RepliSeq slopes were determined for each context separately and then the slopes were
averaged for the combined context.

Determining time of MMR failure in samples

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We aimed to determine the relative time spent in the MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient
states for each of the 24 MSI samples: 10 CRAD, 4 STAD and 10 UCEC (see “PolE
mutants” section above) by deconvoluting their mutational signatures into MSI and MSS
components. To these 24 MSI samples, we added a further 24 MSS samples, matched by
cancer type, while excluding the PolE ultramutators (in CRAD/UCEC) or otherwise
hypermutated (in STAD) samples.
To reduce the number of parameters that need to be estimated, we pooled the contexts with
different 3′ nucleotides together (this corresponds to how bars are drawn in Extended Data
Fig. 3a). An exception were the NCG>NTG changes (deamination of CpG dinucleotides)
that were kept separate from other NCN>NTN changes, which are here denoted as NCH (H
= A, C or T). This yields a total of 28 contexts, for each of which we estimated a pre-MMR
failure relative mutation rate (a) and a post-MMR failure relative mutation rate (b). The rates
were assumed to be constant across samples and in time. Each sample may, however, spend
a different fraction of time in the pre-MMR-failure state (z). Thus the total number of
parameters to estimate is 28 (a for contexts) + 28 (b for contexts) + 24 (z for MSI samples) +
24 (z for MSS samples) = 104.

For a set of 104 parameters, the expected relative frequency of a context ctx in a sample
samp may be calculated as actx*Zsamp + bctx*(1-Zsamp). A measure of goodness-of-fit for a
candidate set of parameters was the negative root-mean-square difference between these
expected relative frequencies, and the observed relative frequencies of use of 28 different
contexts across the 48 samples. We used a genetic algorithm-based optimization to
maximize the fit to the observed mutational spectra, as implemented in the rgenoud 5.7-12
package40 in R. The parameters were at defaults, except max.generations=500,
gradient.check=FALSE, wait.generations=100 and BFGS=FALSE. The starting populations
of solutions were generated with rnorm(1, 0.2, 0.2) for the rates a, rnorm(1, 0.5, 0.3) for the
rates b and rnorm(1, 0.5, 0.3) for the times z.
The optimization was run 100 times with different random seeds for function genoud. The
algorithm always converged to one of two clusters of very similar solutions with very
similar goodness-of-fit scores and that predicted nearly identical mutational spectra for the
48 tumour samples (Extended Data Fig. 4bcd). Upon examining the coefficients of the
solutions and schematic diagrams of the accumulation of mutations in time (Extended Data
Fig. 4e-j), it becomes evident that the two sets of solutions are equivalent, with symmetrical
a and b mutation rates, and also the pre-MMR failure time (z) and the post-MMR failure
time (1-z) across all samples. As the representative solution used in further analysis, we take
the median a, b and z coefficients across solutions of the cluster where the MSI-specific
mutational signature GCH>GTH is predicted to increase in rate after MMR failure. In no
other way was the algorithm aware of which signatures are specific to MSI tumours, or
which of the 48 samples were MSI and which were MSS. The algorithm could, in principle,
be used to deconvolute other mutational processes which have a distinct time of
(de)activation during carcinogenesis. Its practical use would, however, likely be limited to
those processes which, like MSI, have a very distinct mutational signature.
