Abstract
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase forms two multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and
mTORC2, which regulate cell growth, cell survival, and autophagy. Allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, such as
rapamycin, have been extensively used to study tumor cell growth, proliferation, and autophagy but have
shown only limited clinical utility. Here, we describe AZD8055, a novel ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTOR
kinase activity, with an IC50 of 0.8 nmol/L. AZD8055 showed excellent selectivity (∼1,000-fold) against all class
I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) isoforms and other members of the PI3K-like kinase family. Furthermore, there was no significant activity against a panel of 260 kinases at concentrations up to 10 μmol/L.
AZD8055 inhibits the phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates p70S6K and 4E-BP1 as well as phosphorylation
of the mTORC2 substrate AKT and downstream proteins. The rapamycin-resistant T37/46 phosphorylation
sites on 4E-BP1 were fully inhibited by AZD8055, resulting in significant inhibition of cap-dependent translation. In vitro, AZD8055 potently inhibits proliferation and induces autophagy in H838 and A549 cells. In vivo,
AZD8055 induces a dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effect on phosphorylated S6 and phosphorylated AKT
at plasma concentrations leading to tumor growth inhibition. Notably, AZD8055 results in significant growth
inhibition and/or regression in xenografts, representing a broad range of human tumor types. AZD8055 is
currently in phase I clinical trials. Cancer Res; 70(1); 288–98. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/
threonine kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)–like kinase (PIKK) superfamily of kinases. It
functions as a sensor of mitogen, energy, and nutrient levels
and is a central controller of cell growth and a negative regulator of autophagy (1, 2). Mitogenic signals are transmitted
to mTOR via PI3K and AKT (3, 4). mTOR kinase forms two
distinct multiprotein complexes called mTORC1 (containing
Raptor and PRAS40) and mTORC2 (containing Rictor and
Protor). mTORC1, the molecular target of rapamycin, phosphorylates downstream proteins p70S6K (S6K) and 4E-BP1,
both involved in protein translation (5). mTORC2 phosphorylates AKT on Ser473, increasing its enzymatic activity by

∼5- to 10-fold (6, 7). In normal physiology, mTOR activity is
tightly regulated: Phosphorylation of S6K by mTOR induces
the degradation of IRS1, decreasing insulin-driven AKT activity and, therefore, mTOR activity (8, 9). The activity of mTOR
is also regulated by the energy sensor AMP-activated protein
kinase, which stabilizes the TSC1/TSC2 complex and decreases mTOR activity (10). In cancers, increased signaling
through mTOR can be due to enhanced upstream signaling
through activating mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases
or PI3K, or through loss-of-function mutations in PTEN or
LKB1, all of which are associated with an increase in phosphorylated AKT (pAKT; ref. 11).
mTORC1 controls essential functions in cells, such as protein translation, cell growth, and autophagy. Rapamycin is an
allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1 that does not directly affect
mTORC2, except in a small subset of cell lines where, after
prolonged exposure, it decreases mTORC2 function by decreasing mTOR protein levels (7). Perhaps surprisingly, considering its major effect on cell growth and autophagy in
yeast, rapamycin has limited effect on overall protein synthesis, induces only partial growth inhibition, and is a poor inducer of autophagy in cancer cell lines (5, 12). Recent reports
using ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR kinase suggest
that allosteric inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin does
not recapitulate inhibition of mTOR kinase activity (13–15).
In particular, a decrease in phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at

AZD8055 mTOR Kinase Inhibitor with Antitumor Activity

position 37 and 46 is observed with mTOR kinase inhibitors
but not with rapamycin (14). This leads to a greater inhibition of cap-dependent translation compared with rapamycin.
Additionally, inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin and analogues results in the release of the negative feedback loop
between S6K and IRS1, leading to hyperactivation of AKT
(16). In contrast, mTOR kinase inhibitors inhibit AKT phosphorylation. Rapamycin and analogues have only shown clinical activity as a single agent in a limited number of tumor
types (renal cancer and mantle cell lymphoma; ref. 17).
Cloughesy and colleagues (18) showed that in PTEN-deficient
patients with glioblastoma, hyperactivation of AKT after rapamycin treatment was associated with shorter time to progression, suggesting that the absence of AKT inhibition
through mTORC2 targeting limited antitumor activity.
Historically, several molecules inhibiting both PI3K and
mTOR, such as LY294002 or PI-103, have been used as “probe
compounds” to investigate the biology of the PI3K pathway.
Novel agents with dual PI3K and mTOR pharmacology, such
as NVP-BEZ235 and XL-765, are now in clinical development
in oncology (19). More recently, in vitro data have been reported for the ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitors of
mTOR kinase activity PP242 or Torin1. However, no antitumor
activity or tumor pharmacodynamic effects were reported
(13–15). Herein, we described the preclinical pharmacology
of AZD8055, a first-in-class orally available, potent, and specific inhibitor of mTOR kinase activity with profound growthinhibitory effect in vitro and antitumor activity in vivo.
AZD8055 is currently in phase I clinical development.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. (5-{2,4-Bis[(3S)-3-methylmorpholin-4-yl]pyrido
[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-yl}-2-methoxyphenyl)methanol (AZD8055;
Fig. 1A) was identified through screening of a small library
of compounds based around a pyridopyrimidine scaffold
(to be described elsewhere). For in vitro studies, AZD8055
was prepared as 10 mmol/L stock solution in DMSO and
stored under nitrogen. For studies in mice, AZD8055 was dissolved in captisol (CyDex) and diluted to a final captisol concentration of 30% (w/v). AZD8055 was administered by oral
gavage (0.1 mL/10 g of body weight) once or twice daily.
Antibodies. All antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, except phosphorylated PRAS40 (pPRAS40)
T246 (Biosource) and NDRG1 (total) and phosphorylated
NDRG1 (pNDRG1; Dario R. Alessi, University of Dundee).
Cell culture. Cell lines were cultured as monolayers in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine.
Purified enzyme assays. Inhibition of mTOR was evaluated using two methodologies: The high-throughput assay used
an α screen capture complex technology (Perkin-Elmer) with
a recombinant truncated FLAG-tagged mTOR (amino acids
1362–2549; expressed in HEK293 cells) and a biotinylated
p70 peptide substrate. In addition, native mTOR activity
was assayed using immunoprecipitation of full-length mTOR
from HeLa cytoplasmic extract, and the endogenous mTOR
is in protein complexes with Rictor and Raptor. A kinase

assay was performed in the presence of recombinant 4E-BP1
protein as substrate with detection of the phosphorylated
product through an ELISA format. The activity of the lipid
kinases, class I PI3Ks α, β, δ, and γ, was measured using
recombinant PI3Ks with the lipid PIP2 as substrate. Assays
for the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNAdependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) were performed as
described previously (20). Finally, counterscreen against 260
kinases was carried out at a fixed concentration of 10 μmol/L
AZD8055 (Millipore, Inc.).
Kinetic analysis. The activity of mTOR was assayed using
the recombinant mTOR technique described above. For inhibition experiments, AZD8055 was added to the reaction mixture and preincubated for 10 min before addition of ATP.
Inhibition was performed at 1 to 3,000 nmol/L of AZD8055
in varying concentrations of ATP (40–200 μmol/L).
Cell-based determinations of mTOR inhibition. A highthroughput screening cell-based assay was developed using
MDA-MB-468 cells to detect mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity.
Cells were exposed for 2 h to increasing concentrations of
AZD8055 or rapamycin. At the end of the incubation period,
cells were fixed, washed, and probed with antibodies against
S473 pAKT or against S235/236 phosphorylated S6 (pS6). Levels of phosphorylation were assessed using an Acumen laser
scanning cytometer (TTP Labtech).
Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed on ice with buffer containing 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
1% Triton X-100, 50 mmol/L NaF, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
7.6), 0.1% SDS, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors. Total

protein (20–40 μg) was separated on a 12% Bis-Tris Novex gel
and analyzed by immunoblotting. Membranes were blocked
in 5% nonfat milk in 1× TBS/0.1% Tween 20 and then probed
with the respective primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After
washing and incubation with secondary antibodies, the immunoblotted proteins were visualized using the horseradish
peroxidase SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescence Substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Inhibition of cap-dependent translation. HEK293 cells
were stably transfected with a bicistronic reporter cloned
at AstraZeneca with the Renilla luciferase gene under the
control of a viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and
the firefly luciferase gene under the control of cap-dependent
translation. Cells were treated for 6 h with compounds in medium containing 10% FCS; luciferase activity was then measured using a Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega).
Growth inhibition and autophagy analysis. For growth
inhibition and acridine staining, cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of AZD8055 for 72 to 96 h and
stained for cell nuclei (0.03 mg/mL Hoechst 33342) and acidic vesicles (1 μg/mL acridine orange). Images were captured
at 450 and 536 nm on an ArrayScan II (Cellomics) platform,
and the percentage of acidic vesicles and the number of cells
were quantified. For LC3 assessment, cells were exposed to
e64d/pepstatin (10 μg/mL) for 30 to 90 min before incubation with AZD8055. Cells were lysed on ice and analyzed by
immunoblotting.
In vivo studies. Specific, pathogen-free, female nude mice
(nu/nu:Alpk) were housed and maintained in specific,
pathogen-free conditions. The facilities have been approved
by the Home Office and meet all current regulations and
standards of the United Kingdom. The mice were used between the ages of 8 and 12 wk in accordance with institutional guidelines, and all procedures were carried out under
United Kingdom Home Office Project Licence 30/2934.
Tumor cells (106 for U87-MG, 5 × 106 for A549) were injected s.c. in a volume of 0.1 mL, and mice were randomized
into control and treatment groups when tumor size reached
0.2 cm3. AZD8055 was formulated in 30% (w/v) captisol (pH
3.0). The control group received the vehicle only. Tumor volumes (measured by caliper), animal body weight, and tumor
condition were recorded twice weekly for the duration of the
study. The tumor volume was calculated (taking length to be
the longest diameter across the tumor and width to be the
corresponding perpendicular diameter) using the following
formula: (length × width) × √(length × width) × (π/6).
For pharmacodynamic studies, animals were randomized
when tumor size reached 0.5 cm3. The treatment groups
received a single dose of AZD8055 and the control group received vehicle only. Tumor samples and blood were collected
at various times after drug administration. The expression of
pAKT and pS6 was determined in xenograft tissue by immunoblotting as described above. Ki67 nuclear staining was carried out using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded A549
xenografts. Ki67 immunohistochemical nuclear staining was
scored using an algorithm developed for scoring percentage
positive nuclei on an ACIS II image analyzer (ChromaVision
Medical Systems, Inc.) using standard threshold settings.

Plasma pharmacokinetic analysis. Plasma samples were
extracted by protein precipitation in acetonitrile. Following
centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with water in
a ratio of 1 in 5 (volume for volume). Extracts were analyzed
by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using a reversed-phase Synergi Hydro-RP column (Phenomenex) and a gradient mobile phase containing water/
acetonitrile/formic acid. Peaks were detected using a Micromass ZQ2000 mass spectrometer. The assay had a range of
0.02 to 17 μg/mL.
Statistical analysis. In vivo studies: Growth inhibition
from the start of treatment was assessed by comparison of
the differences in tumor volume between control and treated
groups. Because the variance in mean tumor volume data increases proportionally with volume (and is therefore disproportionate between groups), data were log transformed to
remove any size dependency before statistical evaluation.
Statistical significance was evaluated using a one-tailed,
two-sample t test.

Results
AZD8055 is a selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of
mTOR kinase in vitro. AZD8055 was identified through
screening of a small library of compounds based around a
pyridopyrimidine scaffold (Fig. 1A). The inhibitory activity
of AZD8055 against mTOR was evaluated using two different
assays. Using the truncated recombinant mTOR enzyme, the
IC50 for AZD8055 was 0.13 ± 0.05 nmol/L. Using native mTOR
enzyme complexes extracted from HeLa cells, the IC50 was
0.8 ± 0.2 nmol/L (Supplementary Table S1). Homology
models and structure-activity relationship data suggest that
AZD8055 binds to the ATP binding cleft of mTOR kinase
in an analogous manner to that seen for LY294002 in PI3Kγ
(21). Enzymatic reactions carried out using 40 to 200 μmol/L
of ATP resulted in a linear increase in the IC50, indicating
that AZD8055 binds competitively with ATP (Fig. 1B). The
Ki for AZD8055 was identified to be 1.3 nmol/L. AZD8055
was counterscreened against the most closely related kinases, class I and class III PI3K lipid kinases and the PIKK
family members ATM and DNA-PK, where it exhibited at
least a 1,000-fold differential in potency (Supplementary
Table S1). Finally, AZD8055 showed no significant activity
against a commercially available panel of 260 kinases at
10 μmol/L (data not shown).
AZD8055 inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 and prevents
feedback to AKT. Cellular active mTOR compounds were detected using a high-throughput immunocytochemical screening assay in MDA-MB-468 cells. Phosphorylation of AKT was
measured at Ser473 (mTORC2 substrate) and phosphorylation
of ribosomal protein S6 was measured at Ser235/236 (indirect
substrate of mTORC1). The direct substrate of mTORC1,
p70S6K, was not used for the immunocytochemical assay
due to detection of nonspecific proteins by the antibody.
However, immunoblotting indicates that inhibition of phosphorylation of Ser235/236 on ribosomal S6 protein occurs with
a similar dose dependency to inhibition of Thr389 on p70S6K
in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 2A, inset). The cellular IC50s for

dependent manner; 5 nmol/L AZD8055 resulted in 70% to

mirroring those resulting in inhibition of phosphorylated 4EBP1 (p4E-BP1) Thr37/46 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, rapamycin did
not affect translation, consistent with lack of inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation.
In all cell types, AZD8055 inhibited phosphorylation of
AKT on Ser 473 more potently and completely than on
Thr 308 [Figs. 2A (inset) and B and 3B], indicating that
AZD8055 inhibits mTORC2 but does not directly affect
PDK1; this is consistent with other mTOR inhibitors and genetic mTORC2 knockout (13, 15, 22). Simultaneous inhibition
of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by AZD8055 prevented feedback to
AKT Ser473. There was no evidence of induction of pAKT
Ser473 by AZD8055 at either 2 hours (Figs. 2B and 3A) or 24
hours (Fig. 2D) in MCF-7 and all other cell lines studied. In
contrast, treatment of MCF-7 cells for 24 hours with rapamycin resulted in a significant increase in the phosphorylation
of AKT on Ser473 (Fig. 2D), consistent with the release of the
negative feedback loop between S6K and IRS1 previously reported (16, 23). We conclude that AZD8055 inhibits mTOR
kinase activity in cells, which results in a more complete inhibition of mTORC1 than with rapamycin, and the inhibition
of mTORC2 prevents phosphorylation of AKT through the
IRS1 feedback loop.
Effect of AZD8055 on mTORC2 downstream signaling.
Genetic knockout of mTORC2 impairs both AKT and SGK
function (15, 22). In the case of AKT, it predominantly affects
the phosphorylation of the AKT substrate FoxO but not the
AKT substrates PRAS40, TSC2, and GSK3β (22). The effect of
AZD8055 on AKT substrates was evaluated in cell lines with
a range of genetic alterations: HEK293, U87-MG (PTEN null),
A549 (Kras and LKB1 mutant), MCF-7 (PIK3CA mutant,
p70S6K amplified), and U2OS (PTEN null). In all cell types,
AZD8055 induced a concentration-dependent decrease of
pPRAS40 T246 with a maximum inhibition of 70% to 95% depending of the cell line (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of phosphorylation of pTSC2 on T1462 and GSK3β on S9 was detected to
varying levels, and in some cell lines, inhibition of GSK3β
on S9 was relatively weak (e.g., inhibition reached <30% in
U87MG cells). The effect of AZD8055 on FoxO was assessed
in U2OS cells engineered to express FoxO1GFP (BioImage).
AZD8055 decreased the phosphorylation of exogenous FoxO1GFP on T24 and S256 and endogenous FoxO1 T24 (very
weak bands) and FoxO3a T32 in a dose-dependent manner,
resulting in a concentration-dependent relocalization of FoxO1GFP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig. 3B). The drug
concentration leading to a nuclei-to-cytoplasm ratio of 50%
was 67 ± 26 nmol/L (n = 3).
The effect of AZD8055 on SGK activity was evaluated using
the SGK substrate NDRG1 because endogenous SGK is not
readily detectable by Western blotting (15). NDRG1 phosphorylation is inhibited in Rictor- and Sin1-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) and has been reported to be a useful
surrogate for SGK activity and a marker of mTORC2 function
(15). AZD8055 results in a concentration-dependent decrease
in pNDRG1 in U2OS cells (Fig. 3B).
AZD8055 induces growth inhibition and autophagy

of cell growth and autophagy in both Saccharomyces

cerevisiae and mammalian cells (12). Interestingly, rapamycin has shown some discrepancy between inhibition of the
pathway, inhibition of cell growth, and induction of autophagy in mammalian cells (24). This might be due to its limited effect on mTORC1 (partial inhibition of p4E-BP1) and its
lack of effect on mTORC2. The effect of AZD8055 on cellular
proliferation was measured in H838 and A549 [both non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines] and U87MG (glioblastoma; data not shown) determined by nuclear staining
after 72 h of exposure to increasing concentrations of
AZD8055 (Fig. 4A). Drug concentrations inducing 50% inhibition of proliferation were 53 ± 13 nmol/L in U87MG and 50 ±
9 nmol/L and 20 ± 10 nmol/L in A549 and H838, respectively.
Rapamycin has been shown to induce autophagy; hence,
we evaluated whether AZD8055 would affect this process.
The effect of AZD8055 on autophagosome formation in
H838 and A549 cells was first assessed by measuring the formation of punctate acidic vesicles in the cytoplasm detected
by acridine orange as an indicator of autophagy (25). A concentration-dependent increase in acridine staining localized
to punctate cytoplasmic structures was observed after 72 hours
of exposure to AZD8055, suggesting the presence of autophagosomes (Fig. 4B). The maximum increase in acridine staining
was observed with 1 μmol/L AZD8055. Furthermore, immunostaining with antibodies to light chain 3 (LC3) indicated a
concentration-dependent increase in this staining pattern,
consistent with LC3 being localized to these acidic vesicles
(Fig. 4C). Finally, LC3-I is normally converted into LC3-II
(LC3-I covalently bound to phosphatidylethanolamine) during
autophagosome formation but is converted back to LC3-I by
protease cleavage during autophagosome maturation. The
overall formation of LC3-II was detected by preincubating
cells with E64d/leupeptin, inhibiting protease-induced reconversion of LC3-II into LC3-I. AZD8055 increased LC3-II levels
in H838 and A549 cells, and this increase was more pronounced in the presence of E64d/leupeptin, consistent with
an increase in autophagosome formation (Fig. 4D).
AZD8055 induces significant tumor growth inhibition in
a broad range of human tumor xenografts. In mice bearing
U87-MG (PTEN null) glioblastoma xenografts, oral treatment
with AZD8055 resulted in a dose-dependent tumor growth

inhibition of 33%, 48%, and 77% with 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/d
twice daily, respectively (Fig. 5A). A similar dose dependency
was observed in nude mice bearing A549 xenografts: tumor
growth inhibition was 44%, 55%, and 93% after 2.5, 5, and
10 mg/kg/d twice daily, respectively (Fig. 5B). AZD8055 also
resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth and/or
regression in breast, lung, colon, prostate, and uterine
xenograft models when administered either twice daily at
10 mg/kg or daily at a dose of 20 mg/kg (Table 1). Consistent
with rapalogues, AZD8055 results in a transient modest increase in glucose in mice (data not shown).
AZD8055 induces a pharmacodynamic effect on both
pS6 and pAKT in U87-MG and A549 xenografts. The pharmacodynamic effects of AZD8055 were determined in mice
bearing U87-MG xenografts after a single oral administration of AZD8055 at either 2.5 or 10 mg/kg. The levels of
pAKT (S473; corrected for total glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase protein) decreased to 5% and 28% of control levels 20 minutes after drug administration of 10 and
2.5 mg/kg of AZD8055, respectively (Fig. 5C). The inhibition of pAKT was >50% for at least 8 hours in animals
receiving 10 mg/kg AZD8055. A similar pattern was observed for pS6 (S235/236) with levels down to 21% and 67%
of control levels 20 minutes after administration of 10 and
2.5 mg/kg AZD8055, respectively (Fig. 5C). Phosphorylation
of S6 recovered slightly faster than AKT with treated levels being 63% of control levels 8 hours after drug administration.
Free concentrations of AZD8055 of 90 and 291 nmol/L were
observed 20 minutes after administration of 2.5 and 10 mg/kg,
respectively (Fig. 5D). The pharmacodynamic activity tracked
well with the concentrations of the compound in plasma: A
mean-free drug concentration of ∼12 nmol/L was sufficient
to decrease the phosphorylation of AKT by at least 50% in
U87-MG xenografts. This was consistent with a concentration sufficient to inhibit pAKT in U87-MG cells in vitro
(∼10 nmol/L).
The level of proliferation was determined by Ki67 staining
in A549 xenografts 4 hours after four daily doses of 20 mg/kg
AZD8055. The percentage of positive nuclei decreased from
32 ± 2% in xenografts from animals treated with vehicle only
to 10 ± 1% in xenografts from animals treated with 20 mg/kg

Discussion
The present study describes AZD8055 as an orally bioavailable, potent, and selective mTOR kinase inhibitor with
∼1,000-fold selectivity against PI3K isoforms or related
PIKK family members. AZD8055 inhibits tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In some cell lines, it also induces
the formation of acidic vesicles, consistent with a process of
macroautophagy.
Rapamycin and analogues have proven that mTOR is an
attractive target in cancer. The relative limited clinical utility
of rapalogues was, until recently, thought to be largely due to
the release of the S6K, IRS negative feedback loop, and lack of
inhibition of mTORC2 and, therefore, increase in AKT activity. Indeed, Cloughesy and colleagues (18) reported that rapamycin treatment induces an increase in pAKT and the
AKT substrate pPRAS40 in a subset of patients with PTENdeficient glioblastoma. Moreover, increase of pPRAS40 was
associated with shorter survival (18). Dual specificity inhibitors, which target the activity of PI3K lipid kinases and
mTOR (BEZ235 and XL-765), have entered clinical development (19). These agents inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2 but
also inhibit a broad range of PI3K isoforms. In contrast,
AZD8055 potently and selectively inhibits mTOR kinase activity (∼1 nmol/L Ki) without inhibiting PI3K. Recently, the
in vitro biochemical profile of three selective mTOR kinase
inhibitors (Torin1, PP242, and Ku-0063794) has been described in model systems, including MEFs, L6 myotubes,
and human embryonic kidney cells (13–15). Surprisingly,
mTOR kinase inhibitors result in differential effects on both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 compared with rapamycin. We have
extended these findings to a broad range of human cancer
cell models both in vitro and in vivo in preparation for clinical
development of AZD8055 as an anticancer agent.
AZD8055 potently inhibits phosphorylation of AKT on the
mTORC2 site, Ser473, in all cell types studied; in addition, the
T308 site is also inhibited in some cell types, although not as
potently as S473. This is in contrast to genetic knockout of
Sin1 or Rictor, where phosphorylation of S473 is ablated but
the T308 site remains phosphorylated (22, 26). The inhibition
of T308 probably reflects a decrease in the ability of PDK1 to
phosphorylate AKT on T308 when S473 phosphorylation is
transiently but fully inhibited; similar findings have been reported with PP242 and Ku-0063794 (13, 15). This hypothesis
is supported by studies using cells transfected with S473A
and S473D mutants of AKT (to mimic phosphorylation of
S473), where little or no inhibition of T308 occurs with the
selective mTOR kinase inhibitors PP242 (structurally distinct) and Ku-0063794 (structurally similar to AZD8055; refs.
13, 15). The inhibition of AKT phosphorylation induced by
AZD8055 was associated with a decrease in phosphorylation
of AKT downstream substrates PRAS40, TSC2, GSK3β, and
FoxO1/3a. It is interesting to note that AZD8055 resulted
in an unequal magnitude of inhibition of these AKT substrates, pPRAS40T246 was particularly sensitive in all cell

296

types, whereas pTSC2T1462 and pGSK3βS9 were inhibited
more weakly and inhibition varied in a cell type–specific
manner. Phosphorylation of FoxO was studied in U2OS cells;
phosphorylation of endogenous pFoxO3aT32 and pFoxO1T24
was inhibited more potently by AZD8055 than pTSC2T1462
and pGSK3βS9, but the differences were not as extreme as
seen in genetic knockouts. Previous reports using insulinstimulated mTORC2-deficient MEFs (Sin1, mLST8, or Rictor
null) have described FoxO3 phosphorylation on T32 to be significantly inhibited by loss of mTORC2 function, whereas
pTSC2T1462 or pGSK3βS9 remain relatively unaffected (22,
26). Because the AKT substrates PRAS40 and TSC2 control
the overall activity of mTORC1 (27), inhibition of mTORC2
activity by AZD8055 is likely to also indirectly affect mTORC1
activity. Further study in this area may be instructive in differentiating mTOR kinase inhibitors from rapamycin and direct inhibitors of AKT kinase.
AZD8055 binds to the mTOR kinase domain and therefore
directly affects mTORC1 and has a more profound effect on
mTORC1 than rapamycin. Several functions of mTORC1 are
indeed controlled by mTOR but are unaffected by rapamycin.
One of the main functions of mTORC1 is the control of
mRNA translation (5). A recent study showed that 5′TOP
mRNA translation is highly dependent on mTOR kinase activity rather than Rictor or Raptor and that rapamycin had
limited or no effect on this process (28). mTOR also affects
translation by modulating the phosphorylation of S6K on
T389 and 4E-BP1 on T37, T46, S65, and T70. The phosphorylation of these sites on S6K and 4E-BP1 is dependent on an
interaction with Raptor, indicating they are mTORC1 substrates (29). Surprisingly, although rapamycin induces a sustained inhibition of S6K phosphorylation, it has limited effect
on the growth factor–sensitive phosphorylation sites of 4EBP1 (T37/46) and even hyperphosphorylates 4E-BP1 over time
(30). This translates into a modest inhibition of cap-dependent
translation. The present study shows that AZD8055 significantly decreases the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on the
rapamycin-insensitive T37/46 sites and potently inhibits
cap-dependent translation at low nanomolar concentrations,
consistent with the concentrations that inhibit proliferation.
Studies using the mTOR kinase inhibitors PP242, Ku-0063794,
and Torin1 have shown the T37/46 site of 4E-BP1 to be independent of mTORC2 because phosphorylation was unaffected by Sin1 and Rictor knockout but dependent on
Raptor and because phosphorylation was significantly decreased by Raptor RNA interference (13–15). This suggests
that the ATP-competitive inhibitors have differential effects
on mTORC1 compared with rapamycin (13–15). The inhibition of phosphorylation on T37/46 has been associated with
a greater effect on cap-dependent translation, growth inhibition, and potentially autophagy (5). More recently, eIF4GI
was shown to be a major factor linking inhibition of capdependent translation and biological effect such as growth
inhibition and autophagy (31). Rapamycin affects the growth
factor–sensitive phosphorylation sites on eIF4GI (32). In
most cell lines studied in vitro, rapamycin and analogues
induce a partial growth inhibition and limited autophagy
(12, 33). Conversely, AZD8055 induces a profound growth

inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. mTORC1 also controls
autophagy directly by phosphorylating Atg1, although Atg1
might exert a negative feedback loop on mTOR. mTOR indirectly regulates autophagy, as the negative feedback loop
controlled by S6K may control the basal level of autophagy
(34–36). In some cell lines, AZD8055 induces the formation of
acidic vesicles associated with LC3, consistent with the induction of autophagosome formation. Inhibition of mTORC1
via inhibition of mTOR kinase is therefore likely to be responsible for the greater induction of autophagy induced by
AZD8055 compared with that observed with rapamycin.
However, further studies are needed to clarify the effect of
AZD8055 on proteins such as Atg1.
In vivo, AZD8055 was well tolerated and induced a dosedependent growth inhibition and/or regression in a broad
range of tumor xenografts. This was associated with a rapid
and dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effect on both pS6
and pAKT. To date, the mTOR kinase inhibitors PP242,
Ku-0063794, and Torin1 have not reported in vivo activity
in tumor models (13–15). PP242 induces pharmacodynamic
effects in fat, muscle, and liver tissue (13). Further studies are
needed to confirm whether a pharmacodynamic effect of
PP242 in xenograft tumors is associated with antitumor
effect while maintaining a therapeutic index.

In summary, AZD8055 is a potent and selective mTOR
kinase inhibitor that acts on both mTORC1 and mTORC2
and downstream substrates. AZD8055 is orally bioavailable
and induces a dose-dependent growth inhibition of tumor
cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. AZD8055 is currently being
evaluated in phase I studies in a variety of tumors.
