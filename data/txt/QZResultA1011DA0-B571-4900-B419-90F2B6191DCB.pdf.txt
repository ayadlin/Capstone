Abstract
The establishment of the role of MET in human cancer has led to the development of small-molecule inhibitors, many of which are currently in clinical trials. Thus far, nothing is known about their therapeutic
efficacy and the possible emergence of resistance to treatment, a problem that has been often observed with
other receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors. To predict mechanisms of acquired resistance, we generated
resistant cells by treating MET-addicted cells with increasing concentrations of the MET small-molecule inhibitors PHA-665752 or JNJ38877605. Resistant cells displayed MET gene amplification, leading to increased
expression and constitutive phosphorylation of MET, followed by subsequent amplification and overexpression of wild-type (wt) KRAS. Cells harboring KRAS amplification progressively lost their MET dependence and
acquired KRAS dependence. Our results suggest that MET and KRAS amplification is a general mechanism of
resistance to specific MET inhibitors given that similar results were observed with two small inhibitors and in
different cell lines of different histotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that overexpression of wt KRAS can overcome the inhibitory effect of a RTK inhibitor. In view of the fact that cellular models
of resistance to inhibitors targeting other tyrosine kinases have predicted and corroborated clinical findings,
our results provide insights into strategies for preventing and/or overcoming drug resistance. Cancer Res; 70(19);

Introduction
The frequent alteration of tyrosine kinases in human malignancies led them to be considered as targets for antineoplastic therapies; this resulted in the development of several
inhibitors that have shown a strong clinical activity (1–5).
The concept of “oncogene addiction” has added further
rationale to the use of targeted therapies (6, 7). In general,
targeted therapies induce tumor regression in a good percentage of patients. However, almost invariably, responsive
patients develop resistance to the treatment and undergo
tumor relapse (8). A challenge associated to targeted therapies is, therefore, to predict mechanisms that could cause
resistance to the treatment and to find ways to circumvent
these hurdles.

The recent introduction in cancer therapy of several selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has had a dramatic
effect in oncology. However, after the first excitement following the initial results, the problem of acquired drug
resistance has become more and more important and still
represents a crucial limitation. The use of in vitro and
preclinical models, as well as the evaluation of clinical
samples, allowed the identification of several molecular
mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance to
TKIs (8).
The receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), encoded
by the MET gene, which is deregulated in many tumors, is
becoming an important candidate for targeted therapies
(9, 10). Recent studies by our and other groups have shown
that tumor cells displaying MET amplification, which results in receptor overexpression and ligand-independent
activation, feature oncogenic addiction. In these tumors,
inhibition of MET results in impairment of cell growth
and in cell death, both in vitro and in vivo (11–16). In recent times, agents targeting MET—the majority being
small-molecule kinase inhibitors—have entered in clinical
trials (17–19).
In our work, we have established cell lines resistant to
long-term treatment with MET inhibitors and studied the
molecular mechanisms involved in the onset and the development of resistance. We show that prolonged treatment
with specific MET inhibitors drove amplification, overexpression, and constitutive activation of the receptor.
Moreover, we observed that cells progressively amplified

KRAS, resulting in increased expression and activation of
wild-type (wt) KRAS and in activation of the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We show that
amplification of wt MET and KRAS is found in cells of diverse histotypes, resistant to different inhibitors. Moreover,
unexpectedly, we observed that resistance to treatment
was reversible and that the alterations leading to resistance
were lost after drug withdrawal.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
GTL16 and EBC-1 cell lines, which harbor MET amplification, were cultured in either DMEM or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. GTL16 cell line is
a clonal cell line established in our lab (as described in
refs. 20, 21, derived from the poorly differentiated gastric carcinoma cell line MKN45). After cloning, multiple vials of
GTL16 cells were frozen; on thawing, cells were kept in culture for not more than 20 passages. No further characterization of this cell line has been performed, except for the
analysis of the karyotype. EBC-1 cell line, derived from a
metastatic skin tumor of a patient with lung squamous cell
carcinoma, was purchased in 2008 from the Japan Cancer
Research Resources Bank. To characterize the cells, the cell
bank performed isoenzyme analysis. On arrival, cells were
not kept in line for more than 20 passages. Further authentication of the cell line has not been performed by the
authors. Resistant cells were generated by exposure to increasing doses of the inhibitor. See Supplementary Materials
and Methods for detailed information.
mRNA and genomic DNA analysis
Total mRNA extracts were obtained using Trizol extraction kit (Ambion–Applied Biosystems). RNA (1 μg) was retrotranscribed using M-MLV retrotranscriptase minus H
(Promega) in a final volume of 40 μL, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genomic DNA was extracted using Wizard SV Genomic DNA Purification System (Promega). cDNA
(1 μL) or genomic DNA (50 ng) was amplified and analyzed
using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) by real-time quantitative PCR using ABI Prism
7900HT (Applied Biosystems). Specific primers were designed using Primer3 web tool (22). Sequences are available
on request.
Gene expression and gene copy number fold increase were
determined by using the following formula: fold increase =
2∧ − [(Ct of target gene − Ct of control gene)resistant − (Ct of
target gene − Ct of control gene)parental], where Ct means
cycle threshold.
Genomic sequence analysis
Exon sequencing of MET (13–20), EGFR (18, 19, and 21),
PI3KCA (9 and 20), B-RAF (15), KRAS (2–3), and HRAS (2–3)
was performed by automated sequencing by ABI Prism 3730
(Applied Biosystems).

Western blot analysis
Whole-protein extracts were prepared, quantified using
the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce), and analyzed using the
chemiluminescence ECL kit (Amersham). Primary antibodies
anti–phospho-AKT (Ser473), anti-AKT, anti–phospho-p44/42
MAPK, and anti-p44/42 MAPK were purchased from Cell Signaling. Antibodies anti–phospho-MET1234-1235 and antiphosphotyrosine were from Upstate. Antibodies against
KRAS (F234) and anti–β-actin (I-9) were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibodies anti-MET DL21 was
obtained as described (23). Secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham.
Pull-down assay for RAS
Pull-down assays were performed using glutathione
S-transferase (GST)–RAF–CRIB, which specifically binds to
the GTP-bound form of RAS, and Western blots were developed using anti-KRAS antibody (F234).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for KRAS
(RP11-295I5) were purchased from Blue Gnone. Probes for
the MET locus (LSID7S522, spectrum orange), CEP7, and
CEP12 (spectrum green) were purchased from Vysis Abbott.
Comparative genomic hybridization analysis
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses were
performed by NimGenetics. Analyses were performed by
comparing genomic DNA from GR150 versus GTL16 wt
and GR300 versus GR150 using a 244K CGH array developed
by Agilent, Inc.
Biological assays
For growth curve and cell viability assays, cells were seeded in 96-well plastic culture plates (3000 per well) in the presence of the indicated drugs or vehicle (DMSO). Resistant cells
were kept in the presence of PHA-665752 (Tocris Bioscience).
Cell viability was assessed using a luminescence assay
(CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell viability Assay, Promega).
Anchorage-independent growth in soft agar was performed
as described (24), and colony formation was quantified with
the Alamar Blue indicator dye (Trek Diagnostic Systems).
All the measurements were recorded using a DTX 880
Multimode plate reader (Beckman-Coulter). Small interfering
RNA (siRNA) against MET [previously described (11)] was
electroporated using Amaxa Technology (Instrumentation
Laboratory), and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against KRAS
sequence (5′-GUGCAAUGAGGGACCAGUA) was cloned into
an inducible lentiviral vector as previously described (11). wt
KRAS cDNA was cloned into the pRRL2 lentiviral vector by
following a directional cloning strategy using a BamHI-XhoI
digestion. MAPK inhibitors were purchased from Sequoia Research Product (sorafenib), Promega (U0126), and Cayman
Chemicals (PD0325901).
Xenograft transplantation experiments
All animal procedures were approved by the Ethical Commission of the University of Turin and the Italian Ministry of

Health. GTL16 wt or GR300 cells (3 × 105) were injected s.c.
into the right posterior flanks of 6-week-old female CD-1
nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories). Treatment with
JNJ38877605 at half of the maximum tolerated dose or vehicle
was initiated after early tumor appearance (approximate volume, 10 mm3). Tumor volume was monitored every 3 or
4 days for 24 days, calculated as described (25).
Statistical analyses
For experimental data, two-tailed Student's t tests were calculated using GraphPad Prism web tool software. A P value of
<0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Establishment of cell lines resistant to MET inhibitors
GTL16 gastric cancer cells are the prototype of “METaddicted cells,” displaying MET amplification (26), overexpression, and constitutive activation (27, 28). Targeting
MET in GTL16 cells leads to a strong impairment of their
viability and growth ability (11, 13–16).
To study possible mechanisms of acquired resistance to
MET kinase inhibitors, we exposed GTL16 cells to increasing concentrations of the MET inhibitor PHA665752 (29, 30), generating several cell lines resistant to
different increasing doses of this inhibitor. Resistant cells
were analyzed for their biological and biochemical properties.
The growth rate of the resistant cells, which were always kept
in the presence of PHA-665752, was only slightly decreased in
comparison with wt cells (a representative example is shown
in Fig. 1A). Moreover, resistant cells displayed a significant
increase in the IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration)
when compared with wt cells (Fig. 1B), and were able to grow
in anchorage-independent conditions in a similar manner as
parental cells (Fig. 1C).
To evaluate cross-resistance between PHA-665752 and
other MET inhibitors, we treated PHA-665752–resistant
GTL16 cells with comparable doses of JNJ38877605, a specific
MET inhibitor of the same class, currently undergoing clinical trials (31), and found that cells showed a similar behavior
in terms of cell viability and MET status when treated with
either compound (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B).
To evaluate if the resistance to PHA-665752 generated
in vitro was also maintained in vivo, we performed xenografts
in nude mice. Because PHA-665752 has poor pharmacokinetic properties and low oral bioavailability (17), we daily treated the grafted animals with the orally available JNJ38877605,
to which the cells are cross-resistant (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B). As shown in Fig. 1D, mice injected with
GTL16 wt cells did not develop tumors in the presence of
JNJ38877605 (P = 0.0015), whereas resistant cells were able
to originate tumors (P = 0.0222), which were only slightly
smaller than those generated by wt cells in the absence of
JNJ38877605 (P = 0.1659) or by the same resistant cell growing in the absence of the inhibitor (P = 0.3347). These results
indicate that resistant cells generated in vitro are able to originate tumors in vivo in the presence of therapeutic doses of
the MET inhibitor.

Resistance to MET inhibitors correlates with MET gene
amplification
The biochemical analysis of resistant cells showed an increased amount of MET protein, which initially paralleled the
increase in the concentration of the drug (Fig. 2A, top), thus
allowing the maintenance of the basal phosphorylation levels
(Fig. 2A, middle). This was concomitant with an increment in
MET mRNA, evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR (qRT-PCR; Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Treating the resistant cells with concentrations of inhibitor higher than that used to establish the resistance led to
abrogation of MET phosphorylation and to the decrease of
MAPK and AKT activation (Supplementary Fig. S2B). This
is in concordance with previous clinical findings using imatinib, suggesting that, in these conditions, increasing the
dose is an effective strategy to overcome resistance (32).
To evaluate if the observed MET overexpression was due
to gene amplification, a known mechanism of resistance to
small inhibitors (8), we performed qRT-PCR on genomic
DNA and found an increase in gene copy number in the resistant cells when compared with the parental ones (Fig. 2B).
The number of gene copies progressively increased to reach a
maximum in cells resistant to 150 nmol/L PHA-665752
(GR150) and started to decrease in cells resistant to higher
doses of the drug.
MET overamplification was confirmed by FISH and CGH
analysis on PHA-665752–resistant cells. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2C, CGH analysis of GR150 cells displayed a
gain in the genomic area comprising the MET locus when
compared with wt cells. On the contrary, cells resistant to
a higher dose of PHA-665752 (300 nmol/L, GR300) displayed
partial loss of the same genomic area. These observations
agree with the results obtained by qRT-PCR (see Supplementary Fig. S3 for complete CGH analyses).
In GTL16 wt cells, MET is already amplified (11 copies) and
the amplicon is localized outside the chromosome 7 (33) on a
marker chromosome (M1; ref. 26). Performing FISH analysis,
we found that, also in resistant cells, the increased MET copies were not located on chromosome 7 (Fig. 2C).
Acquired resistance to MET inhibitors is an
adaptive process
To discriminate whether the observed amplification was
due to selection of a preexisting subpopulation or if it was
acquired during the treatment, we isolated different clones
of GTL16 wt cells by limiting dilution and treated two of
them (clones 16.1 and 16.2) with increasing doses of the inhibitor to induce resistance (as described in Supplementary
Materials and Methods). We found that, in resistant cells obtained from both clones, the number of MET copies rose with
the increase of the inhibitor concentration, similarly to what
was observed in the bulk population of GTL16 wt cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A). This finding reveals that the observed
genomic alterations were acquired during the selection.
We also induced resistance in GTL16 wt cells with
JNJ38877605, another MET-specific kinase inhibitor, using
the same procedure described for PHA-665752. We thus obtained cell lines resistant to different concentrations of the

MET and KRAS Amplification Mediates Resistance to MET TKI

were evaluated by cell viability assays in GTL16 wt cells and resistant to 300 nmol/L PHA-665752 (GR300). Resistant cells were always kept in the
presence of the inhibitor. D, mice s.c. injected with either wt or PHA-665752–resistant GTL16 cells were subjected to the indicated treatments. Mean tumor

drug. Analysis of JNJ38877605-resistant cells revealed an increase in MET copy number (Fig. 2D), suggesting that MET
amplification is not a specific response to PHA-665752 treatment but a more general mechanism of resistance to selective MET TKIs.
A second hit is responsible for resistance to high doses
of MET inhibitors
As previously mentioned, MET phosphorylation was maintained up to 150 nmol/L PHA-665752. In cells resistant to
higher doses, the level of MET and its phosphorylation
started to decrease (Fig. 2A). Moreover, after silencing MET
in GR300 cells using siRNAs, we observed that cell viability
was almost unaffected compared with what observed in wt
and GR150 cells, which are still dependent on MET signaling
(Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S2D; P < 0.0001). The cells resistant to higher doses of the drug showed a sustained activation of MAPK [extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) 1/2] even if the levels of MET phosphorylation were
low (Figs. 2A and 3B).
All these data suggest that in cells resistant to high concentrations of inhibitor, a new molecular event has taken

www.aacrjournals.org

place and MET activation is no longer the event mediating
resistance. To further investigate this possibility, we first
discarded the presence of mutations in the receptor by sequencing all the transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions
of MET in the parental and derived cell lines. In addition,
no mutations were found in the signal transducers that
are more frequently aberrantly activated in human tumors
and are responsible for increased activation of ERK1/2, such
as EGFR, KRAS, HRAS, B-RAF, and PI3KCA (Supplementary
Fig. S5).
To evaluate if other tyrosine kinases were differentially activated in resistant cells, we performed anti-phosphotyrosine blots
on proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine
antibodies, finding no qualitative differences in tyrosine phosphorylation patterns (Supplementary Fig. S4C); this result
suggests that it is unlikely that other tyrosine kinases (receptor
or cytoplasmic) were significantly activated in resistant cells.
In particular, we also looked at the activation of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members, known to
cross talk with MET, and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor,
but we did not find increased phosphorylation in GR300 cells
(data not shown).

The analysis of the qRT-PCR and CGH data showed the amplification of the genomic region containing KRAS in GR300
cells (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Figs. S3 and S6A). FISH analysis
showed that the extra copies of KRAS were progressively
acquired as double minutes outside chromosome 12 (where
KRAS is positioned; Fig. 3D).
The levels of expression of KRAS in GR300 cells were
strongly increased, whereas the levels of HRAS were unchanged (Fig. 4A, i; P < 0.0001). As shown in Fig. 4A (i and
ii), KRAS protein progressively increased with increasing
doses of the drug. Moreover, pull-down experiments conducted with GST-RAF showed that the augmented expression of KRAS was paralleled by its enhanced activation,
without substantial changes in the ratio of the active molecule (Fig. 4A, iii). Likewise, we found a progressive increase
in the number of KRAS copies in resistant GTL16 clones
(16.1 and 16.2; Supplementary Fig. S4B). This finding reveals
that amplification of both MET and KRAS was acquired during the treatment. Moreover, also cells resistant to high
doses of JNJ38877605 displayed an increase in KRAS copy
number (Fig. 4B).
To prove that the increase of KRAS-mediated signaling
was involved in resistance, we silenced KRAS expression by

transducing the cells with an inducible (Tet-ON) system containing a short-hairpin RNA against KRAS (Supplementary
Fig. S6B). Although KRAS silencing was almost ineffective
in wt cells (Supplementary Fig. S6C), it resulted in decreased
ability of resistant cells to grow in anchorage-independent
manner in soft agar (Fig. 4C; P < 0.0001). As a mirror experiment, GTL16 cells overexpressing exogenous wt KRAS developed resistance to PHA-665752 (Fig. 4D).
To further validate our observations, we induced resistance
to PHA-665752 in the non–small cell lung carcinoma cell
line EBC-1, which displays MET amplification and high sensitivity to MET inhibitors. Resistant cells displayed an increased
expression and phosphorylation of MET (Fig. 5A, top; Supplementary Fig. S7A), as a result of a further MET amplification (Fig. 5B). Moreover, resistance to increasing doses of
inhibitor was coupled to high ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 5A,
bottom) sustained by increased levels of KRAS (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S7B) due to KRAS amplification (Fig. 5B).
MET and KRAS amplification was confirmed by FISH analyses
(Fig. 5C and D).
All these results suggest that amplification of both MET
and KRAS can be a general mechanism of resistance to selective MET TKIs.

Acquired resistance to MET inhibitors retains
dependence on the MAPK pathway
Because resistant cells display a strong activation of ERK1/2,
we wondered if they were still responsive to MAPK inhibitors. Therefore, wt and resistant cells were treated with the
specific MAPK inhibitors U0126 and PD0325901, or sorafenib
(initially identified as a RAF inhibitor and now used in clinics
as a multitarget inhibitor), and their ability to grow in either
anchorage-dependent or anchorage-independent conditions
was evaluated. MAPK inhibitors effectively decreased the
anchorage-independent growth ability of resistant cells
(Fig. 6A) as well as their viability in anchorage-dependent
(adherent) conditions (Supplementary Fig. S8A–C). Western
blots to confirm the effects of MAPK inhibitors on MET downstream pathways are shown in Supplementary Fig. S8D. These
results suggest that blocking pathways downstream to KRAS

www.aacrjournals.org

could be an option to overcome the KRAS-mediated resistance to MET inhibitors.
Acquired resistance to MET inhibitors is reversible
To evaluate if resistant cells have acquired a permanent resistant phenotype, we cultured the GR300 cells in the absence
of PHA-665752 (GR300-0PHA). Approximately 1 month later,
we analyzed these cells and found that they had lost the
increased expression of both MET and KRAS (Fig. 6B). The
decreased level of protein expression was accompanied
by loss of gene copies for both MET and KRAS (Fig. 6C; P <
0.0001), reaching a number of copies similar to that of
the wt cells. Likewise, clones of GR300 obtained by singlecell dilution that underwent withdrawal of the inhibitor
displayed a significant decrease in KRAS copies (Supplementary Fig. S9; P < 0.0001). To show that cells kept in the absence

of PHA-665752 had lost their resistance to the inhibitor,
we treated them again with the drug. As shown in Fig. 6D,
the cells were no longer able to grow in the presence of
the same doses of drug to which they had been previously
resistant, thus behaving as wt cells. A similar behavior was
also observed in cells explanted from tumors resistant to
JNJ38877605 in vivo. When tumors were excised and cells were
put in culture, in the absence of the inhibitor, they lost resistance to the drug.

Discussion
The tyrosine kinase receptor for HGF, encoded by the
MET gene, has very recently become a target for molecular
therapies. Because little is known thus far on the possible
mechanisms of resistance to treatment with MET inhibitors, we generated in vitro resistant cells by using a protocol
similar to those used to establish cells resistant to other
TKIs. We thus treated MET-addicted cells with increasing

the drug. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for resistance, at first, we ruled out the presence of newly occurring mutations that could potentially interfere with the
interaction between the receptor and the drug. Instead,
we found that resistant cells show a progressive increase
in the amount of MET protein that, even in the presence
of sustained concentrations of drug, allows the maintenance
of a level of tyrosine phosphorylation (and hence pathway
activation) comparable with that observed in parental un-

treated cells. By silencing MET expression in these resistant
cells, we observed a strong impairment of their growth, indicating that these cells were still addicted to MET. We
found that this increased protein expression was due to
MET gene amplification, leading to a total copy number
of ∼60. A similar mechanism of resistance has been observed
in the case of other tyrosine kinases, such as Bcr-Abl in patients affected by chronic myelogenous leukemia, where the
amplification of the Bcr-Abl gene is responsible for loss of response to imatinib, and the increase in the dose of the drug
can confer again responsiveness to treatment (34).

In our models, FISH analysis showed that the acquired
copies of MET are not located on chromosome 7 (where
the MET gene is positioned; ref. 33) but on a marker chromosome (26). This suggests a mechanism of progressive acquisition of additional MET copies as a consequence of
asymmetric partitioning of the marker chromosome at mitosis. It is likely that cells gaining MET extra copies have a selective advantage under the selective pressure of the drug.
The observed increase of gene copies is not due to selection
of a preexisting population of cells, but rather to an adaptive
process, because the MET gene underwent amplification also
in a clonal population (generated by limiting dilution cloning
of wt GTL16 cells) exposed to the drug.
It is puzzling to note that the most frequent genetic alteration of MET in human tumors is gene amplification, rather
than mutation (35). This behavior is quite different from

that of other tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR or c-Kit, which
are more frequently mutated in cancer. Interestingly, MET
amplification takes place also in tumors treated with inhibitors of other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and mediates
resistance to treatment (36–38). An example is the case of
some lung cancers treated with gefitinib, where MET amplification and overexpression leads to ERBB3 transphosphorylation, thus inducing resistance to inhibitors of the EGFR
family (39). One possible explanation for MET being frequently amplified relies on the fact that the MET gene is located
within a known chromosomal common fragile site, FRA7G
(33). Hellman and colleagues have shown that conditions
that interfere with DNA replication (called “replication
stress”) induce a perturbation of chromatin organization of
this region, predisposing it to breakage (40). In their work,
they hypothesize that this replication stress exerts a selective

of the inhibitor. A, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar of parental GTL16 and GR300 cells is severely impaired in the presence of U0126,

MET and KRAS Amplification Mediates Resistance to MET TKI

pressure for gene amplification that disappears once the oncogene has attained sufficient amplification. The increased
number of MET copies, counteracting the activity of the
anti-MET drug, rescues cell proliferation.
Interestingly, the number of MET copies increased with
the dose of the inhibitor up to a threshold, after which it
started to decrease. This decrease was accompanied by a reduction of the amount of the MET protein and of its total
phosphorylation. At this point, a second unrelated event took
place in the cells, which had become independent from MET
expression (shown by the fact that MET silencing did not severely impair their viability). We have identified this second
event in the progressive amplification of KRAS, driving receptorindependent MAPK activation. Amplification of KRAS led to
an increased expression and activation of the KRAS protein.
Moreover, parental cells overexpressing exogenous wt KRAS
were capable to overcome the effects of MET inhibitors. In
the same line, previous works published by our group
showed that overexpression of constitutively active KRAS,
bRAF, or AKT could induce the onset of biological resistance
to MET inhibitors (41).
The impaired viability of resistant cells on KRAS silencing
indicates their dependence on KRAS. On the other hand,
parental cells were unaffected by KRAS silencing, likely due
to redundant roles of HRAS and KRAS in these cells. This
phenomenon, known as “oncogene switch,” has already been
reported as a consequence of inhibition of different tyrosine
kinases, but it usually involves the activation of other kinases,
driving parallel signaling pathways (42). In human tumors,
KRAS is almost invariably activated as a consequence of point
mutations, with only a few cases where KRAS gene amplification has been described (43, 44). It is interesting to note that,
as for MET, also the KRAS gene is located inside a chromosomal common fragile site, on chromosome 12 (45), and thus,
it is likely that the same mechanisms responsible for MET
amplification can account also for this second event.
Because specific anti-RAS drugs are not available, we
tested the ability of compounds acting downstream RAS (such
as U0126, PD325901, and sorafenib) to impair cell viability. We
observed that cells resistant to MET inhibitors that underwent KRAS amplification are indeed sensitive to these drugs.
All the molecular events that we have described were
not restricted to a single cell line or to a single inhibitor,
which indicates that they can represent a more general
mechanism to generate cell resistance to small kinase inhibitors against MET.
Finally, we have observed that these cells lost their acquired resistance to MET inhibitors in the absence of the

selective pressure. After culture in the absence of PHA665752, resistant cells lost the acquired amplification of both
MET and KRAS and once again became sensitive to MET inhibition. One possible explanation for this finding relies on
the fact that the amplified oncogenes MET and KRAS are extrachromosomal in the cells examined. Removal of the inhibitor results in an excess of signal transduction that may
induce cellular stress, known to lead to loss of extrachromosomal DNA (46, 47). Cells that underwent loss of MET and
KRAS extra copies have thus an advantage and become the
prevalent population in the absence of MET inhibitor. These
observations suggest that the mechanism of resistance we observed may be less stable than others already described (such
as the appearance of point mutations) and that, possibly, an
intermittent therapy, favoring loss of amplified copies, could
give better results. Reversibility of the resistant phenotype after drug withdrawal has been previously observed by other
groups using other inhibitor for RTKs (48).
This is one of the first preclinical studies highlighting mechanisms of resistance to long-term exposure to selective
MET kinase inhibitors (49, 50) and the first report, to our
knowledge, showing that amplification of MET and KRAS
genes mediates resistance to MET kinase inhibitors. The prediction of molecular mechanisms of resistance to MET inhibitors may provide insights to strategies aimed at preventing
and/or overcoming drug resistance.
