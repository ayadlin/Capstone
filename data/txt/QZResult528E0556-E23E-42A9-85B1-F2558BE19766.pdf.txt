Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms have emerged as essential regulatory elements controlling
cellular levels of Smads and TGFβ-dependent biological outputs such as epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). Here, we identify a HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase known as WWP2 (Full-length
WWP2-FL), together with two WWP2 isoforms (N-terminal, WWP2-N; C-terminal WWP2-C), as
novel Smad binding partners. We show that WWP2-FL interacts exclusively with Smad2, Smad3
and Smad7 in the TGFβ pathway. Interestingly, the WWP2-N isoform interacts with Smad2 and
Smad3, whereas WWP2-C interacts only with Smad7. In addition, WWP2-FL and WWP2-C have
a preference for Smad7 based on protein turnover and ubiquitination studies. Unexpectedly, we
also find that WWP2-N, which lacks the HECT ubiquitin ligase domain, can also interact with
WWP2-FL in a TGFβ-regulated manner and activate endogenous WWP2 ubiquitin ligase activity
causing degradation of unstimulated Smad2 and Smad3. Consistent with our protein interaction
data, overexpression and knockdown approaches reveal that WWP2 isoforms differentially
modulate TGFβ-dependent transcription and EMT. Finally, we show that selective disruption of
WWP2 interactions with inhibitory Smad7 can stabilise Smad7 protein levels and prevent TGFβinduced EMT. Collectively, our data suggest that WWP2-N can stimulate WWP2-FL leading to
increased activity against unstimulated Smad2 and Smad3, and that Smad7 is a preferred substrate
for WWP2-FL and WWP2-C following prolonged TGFβ stimulation. Significantly, this is the first
report of an inter-dependent biological role for distinct HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase isoforms, and
highlights an entirely novel regulatory paradigm that selectively limits the level of inhibitory and
activating Smads.

signalling is also implicated in many human diseases including fibrosis, heart disease and
cancer. These pathologies are increasingly being linked to the TGFβ-dependent induction of
cellular trans-differentiation and EMT (Xu et al., 2009b; Zavadil et al., 2005). TGFβs signal
through Ser/Thr kinase receptors that phosphorylate TGFβ/activin/BMP pathway restricted
R-Smads (Smads 1, 2, 3, 5, 8). Receptors for activin/TGFβ activate Smad2 and Smad3, and
receptors for BMPs activate Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8. Down-regulation of TGFβ
signalling is achieved, in part, by feedback mechanisms involving the inhibitory Smad6 and
Smad7. Deciphering mechanisms that fine-tune and modulate Smads is critical for
understanding TGFβ biological activity and complexity, and ubiquitin-dependent
mechanisms have emerged as key regulatory elements in the control of cellular levels of
both TGFβ receptors and Smads (Lönn et al., 2009).

Protein ubiquitination involves a cascade of events catalysed sequentially by E1 (ubiquitinactivating), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) enzymes. The human
genome contains two E1 ligases generated by alternate splicing of a single gene,
approximately thirty E2 ligases, and over six hundred E3 ligases (Li et al., 2008). E3
ubiquitin ligases are key to target substrate specificity, and these can be segregated primarily
into RING type and HECT domain ligases. Within the HECT-domain E3 ligases is a small
sub-group known as the NEDD4 family. Smurf1 is a NEDD4 family E3 ligase, and this was
the first E3 ligase to be implicated in the TGFβ signalling pathway. Smurf1 binds and
regulates levels of un-stimulated BMP-regulated Smads 1 and 5 (Zhu et al., 1999). Smurf2
binds and ubiquitinylates primarily phospho-Smads 1 and 2 (Bonni et al., 2001), but is also
recruited to the type 1 TGFβ receptor via Smad7 (Kavsak et al., 2000). The NEDD4 subgroup of HECT E3 ligases comprise three functional domains: an N-terminal Ca2+/
phospholipid-binding C2 domain for membrane binding, a central region containing up to
four WW (double-tryptophan) domains, and a C-terminal HECT domain for ubiquitin
protein ligation (Bernassola et al, 2008). The WW domains are essential for target
specificity and they interact with PPXY (also known as –PY−) motifs, phospho-Ser-Pro and
Pro-Arg containing sequences in target substrates (Lu et al., 1999; Pirozzi et al., 1997).
WWP2, which contains four WW domains, is the least well characterised of the HECT subfamily, although it has been implicated in regulating the turnover of the epithelial sodium
channel (McDonald et al, 2002), the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Li et al., 2007),
divalent metal ion transporter DMT1 (Foot et al., 2008), and the stem-cell specific
transcription factor Oct4 (Xu et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2009a).
Here we identify full-length WWP2 (WWP2-FL) and two novel WWP2 isoforms, WWP2-N
and WWP2-C as Smad interacting proteins that selectively bind Smad2/3 and Smad7 and
regulate TGFβ-induced biological responses. Mechanistically, we show that expression of
WWP2-N can modulate TGFβ signalling activity by interacting with WWP2-FL and
activating it’s intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity. Collectively, our data indicate that the
regulation of WWP2 isoform expression could provide a novel switch mechanism
controlling cell context-dependent and disease-specific TGFβ signalling activity.

RESULTS
WWP2 interacts with Smad2, Smad3, and Smad7

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The WWP2 HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase emerged as a candidate Smad3 binding partner in a
previous yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse brain cDNA expression library using the MH1
and linker regions of Smad3 as bait (Wicks et al., 2005). Scrutiny of Mammalian Gene
Collection (MGC) databases containing sequence-validated full-length protein-coding
cDNA clones identified a unique and interesting feature of WWP2 in that there are three
WWP2 isoforms arising from the same gene locus: full-length WWP2 (WWP2-FL, 870aa),
an N-terminal isoform (WWP2-N, 336aa) presumably generated by failure to splice-out
intron 9-10, and a C-terminal isoform (WWP2-C, 440aa) that is likely to be generated from
a second promoter within intron 10-11 (Figure 1a). To independently confirm expression of
these distinct and novel WWP2 isoforms we first used isoform-specific primers and RTPCR to detect transcripts in Colo-357 pancreatic carcinoma cells that are know to be TGFβ
responsive (Levy and Hill, 2005). Interestingly, expression of FL-WWP2 appears to be
induced by TGFβ, peaking after 2 days stimulation and is absent after 4 days (Figure 1b). In
contrast, WWP2-N expression does not change following TGFβ treatment, but does also
disappear after 4 days (Figure 1b). Thus far, we have not been able to clearly detect the
WWP2-C isoform in Colo-357 cells under the same experimental conditions, although we
have seen robust expression in cartilage-derived ATDC5 cells that differentiate following
prolonged exposure to insulin (Figure 1c). Therefore, these data demonstrate that all three
WWP2 isoforms exist, and also suggest that they may be regulated independently in a cellcontext-dependent manner.

To further characterise and confirm interactions between Smads and FL-WWP2 identified
during the yeast two-hybrid screen, we then used co-expression of epitope-tagged proteins
and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoprecipitation of WWP2 from cell lysates
revealed strong binding of WWP2-FL to Smad2, Smad3 and Smad7, but not to BMPregulated Smad1 and Smad5 (Figure 1d). Flag-WWP2-FL interactions with HA-Smad2 and
HA-Smad3, and to some extent HA-Smad7, were also enhanced when cells were TGFβ
stimulated (Figure 1d). Next, we examined whether WWP2 interacts with Smads
endogenously at physiological levels of expression. In anti-WWP2 immunoprecipitates of
lysates from Colo-357 cells, we observed both Smad2 and Smad3 co-precipitating with
WWP2 in a TGFβ-dependent manner (Figure 1e). Specificity of these interactions was
confirmed using stable and inducible shRNA-mediated knockdown of WWP2-FL in which
Smad2 and Smad3 are both absent in WWP2 immunoprecipitated complexes (Figure 1e).
Smad7 also bound to WWP2 endogenously although there are higher molecular weight
Smad7 reactive bands following TGFβ stimulation that are not seen in WWP2-FL
knockdown cells (Figure 1f). This may reflect low and undetectable levels of Smad7 due to
enhanced Smad7 turnover following exposure to TGFβ, or that endogenous Smad7 bound to
WWP2 is predominantly polyubiquitinated.
WWP2 isoforms bind differentially to R-Smads and I-Smads
Since individual N- and C-terminal WWP2 isoforms contain separate and distinct WW
domains, we next examined whether these domains conferred any differential binding

specificity for individual Smad proteins. We co-expressed Flag-WWP2-FL, Flag-WW2-N or
Flag-WWP2-C together with HA-Smad3, immunoprecipitated cell lysates with HA antibody
and then probed Western blots with FLAG antibody. Interestingly, WWP2-N as well as
WWP2-FL, but not WWP2-C, interact with Smad3 in a TGFβ-dependent manner (Figure
2a). Since WWP2-N contains the C2 domain and only a single WW domain (WW1), we
surmise that WW1 in WWP2-N harbours the Smad3 interaction motif. We then used a series
of Smad3 deletion constructs to map the region in Smad3 that binds the WW1 domain of
WWP2-N. Truncated HA-Smad3 mutants comprising either residue 1-395, 1-240 or 1-180
were co-expressed in HEK-293 cells with Flag-WWP2-N, cell lysates immunoprecipitated
with HA antibody and Western blots probed with Flag antibody. Smad31-395 and
Smad31-240 bound efficiently to WWP2-N but not Smad31-180 (Figure 2a). The site in
Smad3 that binds to WWP2-N is therefore within residues 180-240 which includes the WWbinding -PPGY- motif in the linker region. Interestingly, Smad3 C-terminal deletion proteins
Smad31-395 and Smad31-240 interact independently of TGFβ stimulation. It is likely that this
is due to removal of the receptor phosphorylation sites at the C-terminal -SSVS- motif
relieving auto-inhibitory MH1/MH2 domain interactions that normally repress Smad3
function (Hata et al., 1997), and this supports our finding that the interactions between
WWP2 isoforms and Smad3 is TGFβ-dependent. We next examined WWP2 isoform
interactions with Smad2 and Smad7 using the same co-immunoprecipitation approach.
Smad2 bound to WWP2-FL and WWP2-N, but not WWP2-C (Figure 2b). However, it is
WWP2-C together with WWP2-FL, but not WWP2-N, which interact with Smad7 in a
TGFβ-dependent manner (Figure 2c). Smad7 GST pull-down studies confirmed that WW4
domain in WWP2 interacts with the -PPXY- motif in Smad7 (Supplementary Figure S1).
Therefore, it is the WW4 domain of WWP2-C that interacts with Smad7, and this difference
in WW domain binding specificity may be due to the different composition of the PPXY
motif sequence in Smad7 relative to Smad2 and Smad3.

WWP2 promotes Smad protein turnover and ubiquitination
WWP2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is able to ubiquitinate target substrates and can
accelerate proteosomal-dependent protein turnover. To test whether Smad turnover rates are
affected by WWP2, we performed cycloheximde chase experiments in HEK-293 cells
expressing Flag-tagged Smads. Expression of WWP2 significantly enhanced turnover of
Smad2, Smad3 and Smad7 proteins in a TGFβ-dependent manner (Figure 3a). The
acceleration of Smad7 turnover was more pronounced than both Smad2 and Smad3, and
following 6 hours cycloheximide chase Smad7 was undetectable (Figure 3b). We then tested
whether increased levels of ubiquitination could explain the enhanced turnover of Smads in
the presence of WWP2. HEK-293 cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin, Flag-tagged
WWP2 and Flag-tagged Smads 2,3, or 7, and cells were stimulated with TGFβ for up to 6
hours followed by anti-HA immunoprecipitation and anti-Smad immunoblotting. Coexpression with WWP2 followed by TGFβ stimulation clearly enhances the formation of
Smad2- and Smad3-ubiquitinated complexes (Figure 4a). Interestingly, Smads 2 and 3 both
appear to primarily undergo mono-ubiquitination within 6 hours of TGFβ stimulation,
whereas we find typical high molecular weight laddering and smears with Smad7 within 4
hours suggesting increased polyubiquitination (Figure 4b). Although we have focussed on a
timeframe for TGFβ stimulation that correlates with our protein turnover experiments, we do

also find Smad2 and Smad3 polyubiquitination following prolonged stimulation (>16hours)
with TGFβ (Supplementary Figure S2). Therefore, it is likely that mono-ubiquitinated
Smad2 and Smad3 represent transient intermediates, and that more pronounced Smad7
polyubiquitination by WWP2 does indeed reflect preferred substrate specificity. We next
examined whether Smad7 ubiquitination could also be induced by the WWP2-C isoform
since WWP2-C interacts exclusively with Smad7 and also contains the E3 ubiquitin ligase
catalytic domain. Interestingly, we found that WWP2-C can efficiently induce TGFβdependent Smad7 polyubiquitination, and this modification is more pronounced when
compared alongside WWP2-FL in the same experiments (Figure 4c). To confirm our
findings in transfected cells, we next used in vitro ubiquitination experiments with
bacterially expressed WWP2 isoforms and GST-Smad fusion proteins to examine WWP2FL ubiquitinylating activity against Smad substrates. Smad7 undergoes pronounced polyubiquitination in the presence of WWP2-FL and more so with WWP2-C (Figure 4d).
Smad3-GST undergoes moderate ubiquitination in the presence of WWP2-FL and,
interestingly, in these in vitro studies this is enhanced in the presence of the WWP2-N
isoform that interacts selectively with R-Smads (Figure 4e).
WWP2-N directly modulates WWP2-FL and induces breakdown of unstimulated R-Smads

Since the WWP2-N isoform, which lacks the functional HECT E3 ligase domain, influenced
the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of WWP2-FL towards Smad3 in vitro, we next examined
whether WWP2-N expression could influence Smad steady-state levels in the presence of
WWP2-FL. Interestingly, dose-dependent expression of WWP2-N can potently reduce
Smad2/3 steady-state levels in the presence of WWP2-FL, and independently of TGFβ
stimulation (Figure 5a), and cycloheximide chase experiments confirm these findings
(Supplementary Figure S3). In contrast, increased expression of WWP2-N has no effect on
Smad7 levels (Figure 5a). Recent observations suggest that the C-terminal and N-terminal
domains of related HECT ligases can form intramolecular auto-inhibitory links (Mund and
Pelham, 2009; Wiesner et al., 2007). We therefore postulated that truncated WWP2
isoforms might associate with WWP2-FL, and could potentially interfere with
intramolecular auto-inhibitory interactions. To test this possibility, we overexpressed Flagtagged WWP2-FL with HA-tagged isoforms, and used co-immunoprecipitation to identify
direct interactions. In the absence of TGFβ, WWP2-FL clearly associates with itself and
with WWP2-N, and these interactions are disrupted following 1hour treatment of cells with
TGFβ (Figure 5b). The appearance of high molecular weight species also suggests that
WWP2-N might regulate WWP2-FL auto-ubiquitination (Figure 5b), a modification in
WWP2 that is associated with ligase domain auto-activation (Mund and Pelham, 2009). To
address whether the reduced levels of Smads in the presence of WWP2-N might reflect
enhanced WWP2-FL auto-activation, we examined WWP2-FL auto-ubiquitination using in
vitro ubiquitination experiments and find that WWP2-N, as well as WWP2-C, can promote
WWP2-FL auto-ubiquitination (Figure 5c). We then assessed whether the reduced levels of
Smads in the presence of WWP2-N might reflect enhanced WWP2-FL auto-activation in
vivo, and expressed WWP2-FL together with WWP2-N in the presence of HA-tagged
ubiquitin. Immunoprecipitation of HA-ubiquitin modified Smad2 and Smad3 demonstrates
that expression of WWP2-N can increase the level of Smad ubiquination by endogenous
WWP2 (Supplementary Figure S4). Enhanced WWP2-FL activity is concomitant with

increased protein turnover seen in cycloheximide chase experiments (Supplementary Figure
S5), and this is likely to reflect increased WWP2-N-mediated WWP2-FL autoubiquitination. Collectively, these data support the notion that WWP2-FL interacts with
WWP2-N to induce WWP2-FL auto-activation, and that this complex is released following
TGFβ stimulation (Figure 5d), presumably due to TGFβ-mediated R-Smad phosphorylation
and preferential binding of phospho-R-Smads with WWP2.
WWP2 isoforms differentially modulate TGFβ-dependent transcription and EMT

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To characterise the effect of WWP2 isoforms on TGFβ-dependent biological responses, we
first used CAGA12-luc and DE-luc luciferase reporter plasmids to measure effects on
Smad3- and Smad2-dependent gene expression, respectively. In both instances, there is a
significant reduction in TGFβ-dependent gene expression in cells overexpressing WWP2-FL
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6a). Furthermore, ablation of endogenous WWP2 by
transfection of cells with siRNA targeting WWP2 enhances TGFβ-dependent CAGA12-luc
(Smad3) and DE4-luc (Smad2) activity, supporting the notion that WWP2 isoforms can
modulate Smad transcriptional responses (Figure 6b). However, since the WWP2 siRNA
could potentially affect endogenous levels of all three WWP2 isoforms, we cannot rule out
differential effects on TGFβ-dependent gene expression by individual WWP isoforms.
Therefore, we next expressed WWP2-C or WWP2-N isoforms and examined their effect on
endogenous Smad3-dependent transcription using the CAGA12-luc reporter. Interestingly,
over-expression of WWP2-N decreased CAGA12-luc activity following TGFβ stimulation
for 6 hours in contrast to WWP2-C that showed an opposite response (Figure 6c). Moreover,
expressed WWP2-N showed similar effects on Smad-driven DE4-luc and CAGA12-luc
activity following Smad2 and Smad3 overexpression, respectively (Figure 6d). However, we
cannot exclude effects of the truncated WWP2 isoforms acting independently of endogenous
WWP2-FL, although this seems unlikely since in vitro ubiquitination erxperiments do
indeed support the idea that WWP2-N functions by activating WWP2-FL (see Figure 4). To
test whether the ubiquitin ligase activity of WWP2 is required for its effect on Smadmediated transcription we next used a catalytically inactive Cys-838-Ala WWP2 mutant.
We find partial reduction in the inhibitory effect on Smad2 and Smad3 gene reporter activity
with this mutant compared to wild-type WWP2 (Figure 6e). This response may be due to
activation of endogenous WWP2-FL wild-type enzyme by the overexpressed WWP2mutant, in keeping with our observation that WWP2 dimerisation is associated with WWP2
auto-activation (see Figure 5).
To examine further the biological role of WWP2 isoforms in the TGFβ pathway we next
assessed the effects of WWP2 isoform expression on TGFβ-driven epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT represents an important differentiation programme
that converts static epithelial cells into highly motile and invasive mesenchymal cells, a
process that has been linked to cancer cell proliferation, dispersion and metastasis. We used
the Colo-357 pancreatic carcinoma cell line that is known to undergo full EMT upon TGFβ
stimulation (Ellenreider et al., 2001; Levy and Hill, 2005; see also Supplementary Figure 6).
Firstly, we found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of WWP2 in Colo-357 cells treated with
TGFβ enhances the expression of Vimentin by approximately 3-fold based on Western
blotting of cell lysates and causes a moderate increase in Smad 2/3 levels (Figure 7a). We

then analysed effects of WWP2-FL expression in Colo-357 cells on the TGFβ-dependent
induction of EMT markers by RT-PCR. To allow for gene-specific temporal differences in
expression patterns during EMT, cells were next pre-treated with TGFβ for 1, 3, or 4 days
prior to transfection with WWP2-FL. The TGFβ-dependent induction of Vimentin, Snail and
Fibronectin were significantly inhibited in the presence of WWP2-FL, although these effects
were more pronounced following 4 days of pre-treatment with TGFβ (Figure 7b). This
inhibition of TGFβ-induced Vimentin expression in the presence of expressed WWP2-FL
was confirmed by Western blot analysis and correlates with a slight reduction in Smad 2/3
levels (Figure 7c). We then examined whether WWP2-FL expression 3 days after prior
TGFβ stimulation could affect a TGFβ-mediated EMT program that is already underway,
and at the same time also looked at the effect of WWP2-N and WWP2-C expression.
Interestingly WWP2-FL, but not WWP2-N, can effectively block TGFβ-induced Vimentin
expression whereas WWP2-C sustains moderately high Vimentin levels (Figure 7d).
Interestingly, and in complete contrast to WWP2-FL expression, treating cells with a small
molecule TGFβ receptor kinase inhibitor (SB431542) is not able to reverse a TGFβmediated EMT program that is already in progress (Figure 7d). Pre-treatment of cells with
SB431542 also prevents any WWP2 isoform-mediated effects on Vimentin expression,
presumably due to the TGFβ-dependent requirement for WWP2 isoform association with
Smads.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Since WWP2-C contains a single WW4 domain that mediates interactions between WWP2C (or WWP2-FL) with inhibitory Smad7, we next examined whether TGFβ-induced EMT
could be moderated by expression of an individual WW4 domain. We therefore expressed
an isolated WWP2 WW4 domain tagged with Flag in a dose-dependent manner 24 hours
after prior stimulation of Colo-357 cells with TGFβ, and 48 hours later examined expression
levels of both Vimentin and Smad7. We find a clear dose-dependent increase in the levels of
Smad7 in the presence of WW4 and a concomitant reduction in Vimentin (Figure 7e).

DISCUSSION
We have identified the WWP2 ubiquitin ligase as a novel Smad binding partner that
selectively interacts with and ubiquitinates Smads 2, 3, and 7 in the TGFβ pathway.
Furthermore, we have characterised two additional WWP2 isoforms generated from the
WWP2 gene locus, WWP2-N and WWP2-C, and shown isoform-specific interactions with
Smad2/3 (WWP2-N) and Smad7 (WWP2-C). Intriguingly, WWP2-N also interacts with
WWP2-FL, and this complex is rapidly dissociated after TGFβ stimulation. Taken together,
our data suggest that WWP2-N can stimulate WWP2-FL auto-activation and autoubiquitination in the absence of TGFβ leading to increased activity against target substrates
Smad2 and Smad3 (but not Smad7), and that Smad7 is a preferred substrate for WWP2-FL
and WWP2-C following TGFβ stimulation.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of an inter-dependent biological role for distinct E3
ligase isoforms, and demonstrates an entirely novel regulatory mechanism that selectively
fine-tunes levels of both activating and inhibitory Smads. Based on our analysis, we propose
a model in which expression of individual WWP2 isoforms could serve to drive tissue- and
disease-specific changes in TGFβ signalling dynamics and biological responses such as

EMT (Figure 8). Firstly, our data suggests that WWP2-N expression will deplete cellular
levels of unstimulated Smads 2/3 presumably due to WWP2-N-dependent disruption of
WWP2-FL auto-inhibitory interactions, and subsequent breakdown of these receptorregulated Smads. Then, following TGFβ stimulation, WWP2-N is released from WWP2-FL
to interact preferentially with Smads 2/3. Biologically, we predict that this will stabilise the
early phase of pathway activation by WWP2-N competing for WWP2-FL:R-Smad
interactions, in a process that would be further encouraged by the WWP2-FL-dependent
breakdown of inhibitory Smad7 which we find to be a preferred substrate for WWP2. In the
context of a prolonged TGFβ-induced EMT differentiation programme over several days,
and the apparent disappearance of WWP2-N expression after 4 days of TGFβ exposure (see
Figure 1b), the disruption of Smads2/3 interactions with WWP2-FL by WWP2-N would no
longer occur, and this would then further stimulate Smad2/3 breakdown as the EMT
differentiation programme comes into completion. Finally, expression of WWP2-C could be
responsible for localised temporal activation of the TGFβ pathway due to efficient and
selective breakdown of inhibitory Smad7.

The interconnections between Smad stability and individual WWP2 isoforms reported here
could also provide a novel cross-talk mechanism linked to other signalling pathways that
might control WWP2 isoform-specific expression. It is likely that WWP2-N is produced by
an alternate splicing event that retains intron 9 in the mature transcript, enabling the use of
an alternate polyadenylation site and premature stop codon. Regulation of alternate splicing/
polyadenylation is a complex and poorly understood biological phenomenon that involves
cell/tissue-specific expression of mRNA binding proteins and splicing factors (Lutz, 2008;
Nilson and Graveley, 2010). These events are often controlled by extracellular stimuli and
growth factor input, and abnormal splice factor activity is often the hallmark of disease
states Danckwardt et al., 2008; Tazi et al., 2009). It is intriguing that the expression of
WWP2-N disappears towards the final stages of TGFβ-induced EMT suggesting the
existence of mechanisms that tightly control WWP2-N expression, at least during the
progression and execution of this cellular differentiation programme. Although the
generation of the WWP2-N transcript can be explained by alternative splicing events, the
presence of a C-terminal isoform downstream of a TATA sequence and a putative start ATG
codon suggests that like other proteins such as transcription factors p53/p73 (MurrayZmijewski et al., 2006), WWP2-C isoform may arise due to the presence of intronic
promoter activity. Other NEDD4 isoforms, variants of WWP1 and Nedd4-2 lacking the Nterminal regions have been described previously (Flasza et al., 2002; Raikwar et al., 2008),
although these have not been ascribed biological functions. At present, the regulation of
WWP2-C expression remains unclear and is the focus of on-going studies, although
abundant expression has been detected in chondrocyte cell lines.
Elevated TGFβ signalling activity is associated with the pathobiology of many human
diseases including fibrosis, heart disease and cancer metastasis. The main findings in this
study highlight a key role for WWP2 in TGFβ-dependent EMT, and information reported
regarding WWP2 isoform-specific interactions with activating Smads2/3 and inhibitory
Smad7 could provide a novel approach to selectively moderate levels of R-Smads and ISmads. Significantly, we have shown that over-expression of an isolated WWP2-WW4

domain can increase cellular levels of I-Smad7 and prevent EMT, presumably by disrupting
interactions between Smad7 and both WWP2-FL and/or WWP2-C isoforms. Interestingly,
elevating Smad7 levels is known to have therapeutic potential by inhibiting EMT (Javelaud
et al., 2007; Valcourt et al., 2005), and supporting apoptotic events involving TNF, ATM
and p53 in hyper-proliferating cells (Hong et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2006). Therefore,
similar benefits could be achieved in future strategies that specifically target Smad7
interactions with the WW4 domain in WWP2 and/or WWP2-C that would then stabilise
inhibitory Smad7 levels.
In summary, this is the first characterisation of a regulatory mechanism involving individual
E3 ubiquitin ligase isoforms that modulate TGFβ-induced EMT by selectively targeting
activating and inhibitory Smads. In future studies, it will be important to address further the
biological roles of individual isoforms using mis-expression approaches in stable cell lines.
Additionally, it will be vital to establish normal and disease expression patterns of all three
WWP2 isoforms, with particular emphasis on metastatic disease.

Rabbit anti-Smad3 (Chip grade, Abcam), Rabbit anti-Smad2 (Cell Signalling), Mouse antiSMAD7 (New England Biolabs), high affinity Rat anti-HA (Roche), M2 Mouse anti-Flag
(Sigma), mouse anti-human Vimentin (Sigma), mouse anti-β actin (Sigma) and goat antiWWP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as recommended by the manufacturers.
Scrambled (SCR) and siRNA for WWP-2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Plasmids encoding the Flag-tagged derivatives of human WWP2, obtained from Fiona
McDonald (University of Otago, NZ), were constructed by PCR cloning into pRK5
followed by the insertion of the Flag coding sequence at the 5′ terminal. Derivation of
human HA-/Flag-tagged Smad2, Smad3 and Smad7 is described elsewhere (Wicks et al,
2005). Human HA-tagged ubiquitin (expressed in pCDNA3.1+) was a kind gift from Dirk
Bohmann (University of Rochester, USA). MG132 was purchased from Sigma reconstituted
in DMSO and used at 10μM, and SB431542 was purchased from Tocris Ltd and used at
10μM concentration. TGFβ and Bone Morphogenetic Protein-4 (BMP-4) were from R&D
systems. For bacterial WWP2 expression plasmids, the WWP2 coding sequences were PCR
amplified (see Supplementary Information) and cloned into pET28A (Novagen) or
pGEX5X-1. Stable expression shRNA encoding plasmids specific for WWP2-FL were
generated by annealing and cloning phosphorylated complementary oligonucleotides into
Bgl II cleaved plasmid pTER (see supplementary information), and used to generate stable
Colo-357-Tet repressor expressing cells (as described in Levy and Hill, 2005). Expression
was induced by stimulation of cells with 2μM Doxycycline (Melford Laboratories) for 48
hours.
Semi-Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from mammalian cells (Promega SV40 Total RNA Isolation) and
1μg converted to cDNA using random-hexamer primers and reverse transcriptase

as template in a 50μl reaction using specific primers (see Supplementary Information).
Immunoprecipitation Assays

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Transfected cells treated with either 10μM MG132 for 5 hours in DMEM medium
containing 2 % FCS and treated +/− 5ng/ml TGFβ for 1hr, washed in cold PBS, lysed in 1%
v/v Igepal-630, 50mM Tris pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 5mM EDTA, 1mM
NaF, 1mM Na3VO4 and protease inhibitors (1% NP-40 LB), in the ratio 1 tablet (Roche): 30
ml 1% NP-40LB. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with 0.5μg high
affinity anti-HA antibody (Roche) and 20μl of protein-G agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4°C.
Immune-complexes were harvested (2000 rpm; 30 sec), and repeatedly washed using 0.1%
NP-40 LB. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 15μl Laemelli buffer (+10mM DTT),
and samples analysed by Western blotting.
Cycloheximide Chase
HEK293 cells were transfected and after 48 hours were pre-treated with 10μM MG132 for 5
hours in DMEM (+ 2% serum). Cycloheximide (20μM) was added and cells incubated for 1
hr. The medium was removed and replaced with DMEM medium (+2% serum) and 20μg/ml
cycloxeximide, and cells harvested at specified time-points. Cells were washed in ice cold
PBS, lysed in 1% NP-40LB and analysed by Western blotting.
Bacterial WWP2 expression and in vitro ubiquitination assay

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

WWP2-pET28A protein expression was induced in BL-21 Lys-S (Novagen) cells and
proteins purified using Ni-NTA agarose as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen).
Approximately 100ng of each purified protein was incorporated into the in vitro
ubiquitination assay using 1μg of GST-Smad substrate and the quantities of His-Ub, rabbit
E1, His-Ub-carrier protein 6 under conditions previously reported (Xu et al., 2004).
Following incubation (30°C), each reaction divided into 2, and each half analysed by
Western blotting for Smad and WWP2.
Luciferase Reporter Assays
The Smad3 reporter construct (pCAGAC12-luc) and the Smad2-specific reporter plasmid
DE-luc were kindly provided by Caroline Hill (CRUK Laboratories, UK). For each plasmid
transfection, 250ng pCAGAC12-luc and 15ng pRSV-β-galactosidase (pRSV-βgal) encoding
plasmid were used in conjunction with Smad encoding plasmids as described previously
(Wicks et al, 2005). Values were averaged, luciferase activity standardised for βgalactosidase activity and data expressed as relative fold changes in luciferase activity over
basal activity. 250ng of DE-luc, 50ng pMIXER and 15ng pRSV-bgal were used in
conjunction with other Smad expression plasmids for detection of Smad2-specific activity as
described above.
Induction of EMT in Colo-357 cells
Colo-357 cells were seeded at 104 cells per 35 mm plastic well (Nunclon) and the next day
left unstimulated, stimulated with 5ng/ml TGFβ, 5ng/ml TGFβ+SB431542, and everyday

Figure 8. A model of WWP2 isoform action on TGFβ signalling activity and EMT

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

In the absence of TGFβ, WWP2-N expression causes rapid breakdown of unstimulated
Smads 2/3 due to WWP2-N-dependent disruption of WWP2-FL auto-inhibitory interactions.
Following TGFβ stimulation, WWP2-N is released from WWP2-FL to interact
preferentially with Smads 2/3, initially slowing down R-Smad turnover. In the context of a
prolonged TGFβ-induced EMT differentiation programme over several days, and the
apparent disappearance of WWP2-N expression after 4 days of TGFβ exposure (see Fig 1b),
the blockade of Smads2/3 interactions with WWP2-FL by WWP2-N would no longer occur,
and this would then further stimulate Smad2/3 breakdown as the EMT differentiation
programme comes to completion. Finally, expression of the WWP2-C isoform could be
responsible for localised temporal activation of the TGFβ pathway due to efficient and
selective breakdown of inhibitory Smad7.
