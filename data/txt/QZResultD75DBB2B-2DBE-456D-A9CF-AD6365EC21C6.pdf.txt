ABSTRACT:

RNAi screening holds the promise of systemizing the search for combination
therapeutic strategies. Here we performed a pooled shRNA library screen to
look for promising targets to inhibit in combination with inhibition of the mitotic
regulator polo-like kinase (PLK1). The library contained ~4,500 shRNAs targeting
various signaling and cancer-related genes and was screened in four lung cancer
cell lines using both high (IC80) and low (IC20) amounts of the PLK1 inhibitor
GSK461364.
The relative abundance of cells containing individual shRNAs
following drug treatment was determined by microarray analysis, using the mock
treatment replicates as the normalizing reference. Overall, the inferred influences
of individual shRNAs in both high and low drug treatment were remarkably similar
in all four cell lines and involved a large percentage of the library. To investigate
which functional categories of shRNAs were most prominent in influencing drug
response, we used statistical analysis of microarrays (SAM) in combination with
a filter for genes that had two or more concordant shRNAs. The most significant
functional categories that came out of this analysis included receptor tyrosine
kinases and nuclear hormone receptors. Through individual validation experiments,
we determined that the two shRNAs from the library targeting the nuclear retinoic
acid receptor gene RARA did indeed silence RARA expression and as predicted
conferred resistance to GSK461364. This led us to test whether activation of RARA
receptor with retinoids could sensitize cells to GSK461364. We found that retinoids
did increase the drug sensitivity and enhanced the ability of PLK1 inhibition to
induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis. These results suggest that retinoids could
be used to enhance the effectiveness of GSK461364 and provide further evidence
that RNAi screens can be effective tools to identify combination target strategies.

INTRODUCTION

potential to systematize the search for genes to target
in combination with specific anti-cancer agents. Initial
screens have pinpointed checkpoint kinase inhibition as
an effective combination with gemcitabine treatment in
pancreatic cancer cells [2], MEK inhibition as an effective
combination with EGFR inhibition in KRAS wild-type cells
pancreatic cancer cells [3], and inhibition of Wnt/Ca2+/
NFAT signaling as an enhancer of BCR-ABL inhibition

Developing combinations of chemotherapeutic
agents that increase tumor cell toxicity was a major
milestone in cancer treatment [1]. Testing for
advantageous combinations continues to be a driver
in improving cancer care, but is limited by a lack of
comprehensive methodology. RNAi screening has the

RESULTS

in CML cells [4]. Here we used RNAi screening to look
for sensitizers to the candidate cancer drug GSK461364A,
a potent inhibitor of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) [5]. PLK1
is expressed during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle
and together with the Cdk1/Cdc2 kinase regulates key
events in mitosis [6]. Mitotic arrest and apoptosis have
been observed in preclinical studies using either RNAi,
GSK461364A, or other small molecules that inhibit PLK1
[6]. Initial motivation for developing inhibitors of PLK1
as candidate cancer drugs was the potential to avoid the
toxicities of traditional antimitotics that target tubulin
structures equally in both cancer and nondividing cells
[6, 7]. Perhaps a more compelling rationale is based on
findings that PLK1 inhibition is selectively potent for cells
harboring mutant TP53 or mutant KRAS [8-10], which is
the reverse of the usual situation where altered TP53 and
mutant KRAS confer drug resistance.
Several PLK1 inhibitors are in phase I or II clinical
studies and some patients have achieved clinical response,
although sometimes only when dosed above the maximum
tolerated dose defined in the study [6]. Based on this,
PLK1 inhibitors may need to be used in combination with
an approved cancer drug in order to be clinically useful.
In this study looked for PLK1-combination targets in
non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC), a clinically
important tumor type that is driven to a significant degree
by mutations in TP53 and KRAS and that as a whole are
particularly sensitive to PLK1 inhibition [7].

We focused on four NSCLC cell lines, two that
harbor mutant KRAS but are wild-type for TP53 (A549
and NCI-H460) and two that harbor mutant TP53 but are
wild-type for KRAS (NCI-H522 and NCI-H322). Based on
the belief that high or low concentrations of a drug could
make a significant impact on the RNAi screening results,
we want to screen each of the four cell lines for shRNAs
that could influence the response to GSK461364A at both
low and high doses (IC20/IC80). Therefore we determined
the concentrations of GSK461364A that could cause 20%
and 80% of maximal growth inhibition. All four cell lines
were sensitive to GSK461364A, but one TP53 mutant and
one KRAS mutant cell line (NCI-H322 and NCI-H460)
were more sensitive with IC20/IC80 values of 1 nm / 10
nM, compared to the other pair (NCI-H522 and A549),
which both required higher doses to reach 20% and 80%
maximal inhibition (30 nM / 100 nM).
The RNAi screening methodology we employed
was the pooled multiplex approach where each shRNA
is tagged with a molecular barcode that together with
the shRNA insert itself serve as microarray hybridization
probes to deconvolute the relative abundance of the
individual shRNAs (Figure 1) [11]. The 4,603-shRNA
library was constructed in the retroviral vector MLP that
expresses shRNAs with endogenous miR-30 flanking
sequences [12]. This library targets 1,657 genes from
three functional classes (kinases, cell cycle genes,
functional cancer genes) with an average of 2 to 3 distinct
shRNAs per gene [11]. We transfected the shRNA library
into human cancer cells at a low multiplicity of infection

(0.25) to ensure that each cell on average was transfected
with only one distinct shRNA, and for each cell line
in total we transfected twelve 150 mm. plates each
containing approximately 107 subconfluent cells [11].
Based on averages, each individual shRNA in the library
was present in approximately 1000 cells. We selected
for stable transfectants using puromycin (3- 5 days) and
then used three plates to prepare genomic DNA for three
biological replicates for the initial time point (t = 0). We
divided the remaining nine plates into three groups; the
high and low drug groups which received GSK461364A
and the mock treatment group (see Methods).
To readout the relative abundance of individual
shRNAs by microarray, we used vector primers to PCR
amplify the shRNA and barcodes from genomic DNA
prepared from human cells after selection and different
treatments, and the resultant PCR product was labeled with
Cy3 dye (Figure 2). We used the same primers to amplify
the shRNA and barcodes from the library DNA prepared
in E. coli, and used this as the common Cy5-labeled
reference hybridization probe. We used competitive twocolor hybridization to a custom microarray to readout
the relative abundance of individual shRNAs following

integration into the recipient cell line and its treatment
with drug or mock treatment (Figure 2).
Following standard microarray data processing steps
including PCA analysis to exclude poor hybridizations
and exclusion of hybridization probes with signals close
to background levels, we obtained reliable data for 3,003
shRNAs for all hybridizations except for the three for the
high-dose GSK461364A treatment of NCI-H322, which
were excluded. To focus our attention strictly on the drug
related effects of the individual shRNAs, we normalized
the log2 fluorescent ratios to the average value of the
mock treatments, so that on average the log2 ratios of
mock treatments would be zero. To look at the structure
of the resultant data, we performed hierarchical clustering
of both the samples and the shRNAs and visualized the
results with a heatmap, such that shRNAs that conferred
sensitivity to GSK461364A are shown in blue, shRNAs
that conferred resistance to GSK461364A are displayed
in red, and shRNAs with neutral effects are shown in
white (Figure 3). As expected, the individual mock treated
samples appeared largely neutral, and the individual
replicates for the four different cell lines all clustered by
cell line identity. However, we were surprised to see that

there was little if any difference between the IC20 or IC80
treatments, such that for each cell line the two treatment
groups were intermingled (Figure 3). Therefore it appears
that, at least for the response to GSK461364A, there is
not a significant difference between high or low drug
concentrations in terms of impact on the RNAi screening
results.
We next turned our attention to the individual
shRNAs. The visual impression (Figure 3) that a major
portion of the shRNAs had an appreciable effect on
response to GSK461364A was confirmed by calculating
the percentage of shRNAs that were significantly gained
or lost relative to mock treated cells (44%; p < 0.05). This
high percentage is perhaps not too surprising given that
the genes targeted by this library encode either functional
cell cycle or cancer genes, or kinases [11]. The most
distinct cluster of shRNAs is a set of approximately 300
shRNAs (on the bottom of the heatmap, cluster 5) that
appeared to confer resistance to GSK461364A (Figure 3).
This group included two shRNAs targeting RARA. This
H460

group behaved similarly in all four cell lines, indicating a
relative uniformity of response to the individual shRNAs.
The next most distinct cluster is a set of approximately
600 shRNAs that for the most part appeared to uniformly
confer sensitivity to GSK461364A (cluster 4) (Figure
3). The remaining clusters included a cluster of weaker
resistance shRNAs (cluster 2), weaker sensitizer shRNAs
(cluster 3), and a group of shRNAs that appeared to
have more variable effects on response to GSK461364A
depending on the cell line (cluster 1) (Figure 3).
We used the statistical technique SAM to more
rigorously determine which shRNAs were the most
significant for causing resistance or sensitivity to
GSK461364A. Based on the extensive similarity of
shRNAs in both low and high drug concentrations, these
treatments were grouped together for all cell lines into
one class and compared to all the mock treatments as the
other class. Using a false-discovery rate of 3.5%, 816
shRNAs were found to significantly affect the response
to GSK461364A in the four lung cancer cell lines. To

EGFR and IGFR1, where the shRNAs targeting these
genes enhanced the response to GSK461364A [Table 1].
The second group, comprised of 25 protein kinase genes,
contained mostly sensitizer and a few resistance genes
[Table 1]. The third group contains four mitotic proteins
(ANAPC5, CDC16, CDC20, CDC27) and shRNAs
targeting these mitotic genes are predicted to sensitize
cancer cells to GSK461364A [Table 1]. The fourth and
fifth groups are nuclear hormone receptors and protein
tyrosine phosphatases [Table 1]. Of particular interest to
us were the five nuclear hormone receptors involved in
retinoic acid signaling: TR2 [14], TR4 [15], NURR1 [16],
NOR1 [17], and the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene,
RARA. Retinoids that activate retinoic acid receptor alpha
have been shown to be safe and shown some efficacy in
clinical trials with NSCLC [18]. Based on these findings
and the relative safety of retinoids, we decided to further
study this potential for a combination therapy with
GSK461364A.
We first validated that the two shRNAs pinpointed
by the screen did indeed silence expression of RARA

help rule out off target effects of individual shRNAs,
we focused on the subset of the 816 significant shRNAs
where there were two or more that targeted the same gene
and caused the same effect (resistance or sensitivity). 201
shRNAs met this criteria, the majority of which conferred
sensitivity, although not as uniformly as those conferring
resistance (Figure 4).
To gain insight into the biological functions affecting
by these 201 shRNAs, we examined the corresponding 97
genes using the DAVID Gene Functional Classification
Tool, which utilizes multiple sources of functional
annotation [13] (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov). For an
appropriate background set of genes for which to perform
the statistical enrichment tests, we used all 693 genes
that are targeted by two or more shRNAs in the library.
This analysis yielded five groups of related genes that
represented biological processes enriched in the 97 out of
693 genes [Table 1]. Here we briefly describe these groups
and postpone addressing biological implications until the
discussion section. The first group, cell surface receptor
linked signal transduction, includes eight genes including

and showing consistently lower relative abundance or higher relative abundance. The shRNAs (rows) of the heatmap were not clustered

and confer resistance to GSK461364A when assayed
individually (Figure 5). We reasoned that if silencing
RARA could confer resistance to GSK461364A that
activating its protein product with ligands could confer
sensitivity. To test this idea, we examined the ability
of ligands to sensitize lung cancer cells to different
concentrations of PLK1 inhibitor. We found that the
combination of RAR-alpha ligand (ATRA) and RXRalpha ligand (9-cis-retinoic acid) were more potent at
sensitizing cells to GSK461364A than single ligand (data
not shown), in agreement with a previous report [19].
Using the combination of ATRA and 9-cis-retinoic acid,
we found that the four lung cancer cell lines displayed on
average a one-log increase in sensitivity to GSK461364A
(Figure 5). Perhaps of greater significance in terms of
therapeutic benefit is the apparent increase in number
of cells killed at higher doses of GSK461364A for three
of the four lung cancer cell lines (Figure 5). Encouraged
by these results, we next examined whether ATRA and
9-cis-retinoic acid potentiated cancer cell inhibition by
GSK461364A by enhancing its previously demonstrated
ability to cause mitotic arrest and apoptosis. After three
days of treatment, we examined A549 lung cancer cells
by flow cytometry to determine their position in the
cell cycle and by immunofluorescence using antibodies

a

to the mitotic marker histone H3 and apoptotic marker
active caspase-3 to measure mitosis-associated apoptosis.
This analysis showed that ATRA and 9-cis-retinoic acid
enhanced the ability of GSK461364A to induce cell
cycle arrest in G2/M and also significantly increased
the percentage of cells undergoing mitotic-associated
apoptosis, from less than 5% for GSK461364A alone to
32% of the cells (Figure 5). Thus ATRA and 9-cis-retinoic
acid does not appear to change the cellular mechanism
of action of GSK461364A but instead act as sensitizers.
As discussed below, these results establish retinoids are
interesting candidates for combination therapy strategies
with GSK461364A.

DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that shRNA screening is an
effective method for identifying the biological processes
that are potentially important in anti-cancer drug action as
well as for identifying combination cancer drug strategies.
One of the most critical steps in our analysis of the arraybased screening results for the four different lung cancer
cell lines was to normalize the individual shRNA readouts
for the drug treatments to the average value of the mock
treatments. This step eliminated much of the cell line

variability that existed for individual shRNAs and enabled
us to determine that a substantial portion of shRNAs in
the library did affect response to the PLK1 inhibitor
GSK461364A. As our library was focused on kinases
and cell cycle genes, whether such a high percentage
of biologically active shRNAs would be observed in
a true genome-wide shRNA screen is far from certain.
Nevertheless, by focusing on the statistically significant
shRNA changes and by filtering against off-target effects
by requiring two or more significant shRNAs targeting
the same gene to have the same effect, we were able to
identify a set of 97 genes that were enriched for important
biological functions that are likely important mediators
of the ability of GSK461364A to inhibit cancer cell
proliferation. Amongst these functions was cell-surface
tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, including the EGFR
and IGFR1 genes. It was somewhat surprising that our
results predicted that silencing EGFR or IGFR1 would
have an effect in our cell line panel since two cell lines
harbor mutant KRAS and the current paradigm is that
mutant KRAS obviates any dependency upon upstream
receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. However, phenotypic
effects of inhibiting these two genes in mutant-KRAS
NSCLC cell line have been observed, suggesting that this
paradigm may not always accurately reflect cancer biology
[20]. Another key functional group included the anaphase
complex proteins CDC20, CDC16, CDC27, and APC5.
That loss-of-function of these proteins would enhance

the effects of inhibiting polo-kinase 1 is in line with the
notion that one PLK1 primary function is to promote the
activation of the anaphase complex during mitosis [6].
Another key group were nuclear hormone receptors
that affect retinoic acid signaling, including retinoic
acid receptor alpha (RARA). We picked this group for
follow-up studies based on the possibility of combining
GSK461364A with relatively non-toxic retinoids, which
had previously been established as being tolerated and
potentially effective in NSCLC [18]. Two shRNAs
designed against RARA that were pinpointed by the
array study were validated for their ability to silence
RARA expression and confer resistance to GSK461364A.
Conversely, we showed that activating RARA with
retinoids induced increased sensitivity by an order of
magnitude to GSK461364A, an effect seen in all four lung
cancer cell lines. These results provide a strong rationale
for including a retinoid arm in future clinical trials of
PLK1 inhibitors.
In conclusion, our results provide further evidence
for the utility of shRNA pooled screening in designing
combination therapy strategies for cancer drugs. Several
aspects of pooled shRNA screening are being further
optimized and should lead to even more effective ability
to uncover combination strategies. These optimizations
include the use of larger libraries that encompass more of
the whole genome [21] and next generation sequencing

effect and so on. The spatial correction used a window of
300 probes. Within each window, the intensity of the inside
probes was scaled to make sure the median probe intensity
in the window was equal to the median on the whole array.
We then applied a background filter: for each probe set,
we calculated the median intensity of background probes
in each channel for each sample in the mock treatment
group. These medians are taken to be estimations of the
background. Next, we removed probes from the dataset
whose intensity was less than 1.5 times of background in
red or green channel in more than half of the samples in
the mock treatment group. We then applied global loess
normalization to remove the imbalance between the red
and green channels, using the R package limma (version
2.8.1) and the function ânormalizeWithinArraysâ. The
parameter âmethodâ in that function is chosen as âloessâ.
After normalization, we obtain a log (base 2) ratio between
green channel and red channel for each probe.
Following normalization, we processed the shRNAs
that have both barcode probe and half hairpin probe
printed on the array. To collapse the data from the probe
level into the shRNA level, one choice would be to take
the mean of the probe ratios. But as the two types of
probes are different in probe length and nucleotide

METHODS
RNAi screen and computational analysis
The RNAi screen was performed according to the
protocol published by Silva et al. using multiplex Agilent
microarrays [11]. Probe intensity files for the microarrays
were generated from Agilentâs Feature Extraction
software, and we used the column âgMeanSignalâ as test
channel signal, and column ârMeanSignalâ as reference
channel signal. Probes from shRNAs not used in our
library were used as negative probes for background
estimation. The array contained two types of probes:
barcode probes (60 mers) and half hairpin probes (21
mers). As these probes behaved differently, the barcode
probe set and half hairpin probe set; they were processed
separately during the background filter and normalization
steps. We performed spatial correction to remove spatial
effects resulting from uneven washing, evaporation edge

retinoids. Panel B. The effects of ATRA on the ability of GSK461364A to induce mitosis-associated apoptosis three days post-treatment.

The concentration of retinoids used was ATRA and 9-cis-retinoic acid both at 1 micromolar and for GSK461364A was 10 nM. A549 cells
were fixed and reacted sequentially with anti-phosphohistone H3 (phospho-Ser10; Abcam), anti-active Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling), and
secondary antibodies with fluorescent labels Alexa 488 (for anti-phosphohistone H3) and Alexa 568 (anti-active Caspase3) (Molecular
Probes). The cells then were counter-stained with DAPI, mounted, sealed, and photographed using a Zeiss AxioVision (20x). 200 cells
were scored for each condition, and the background percentage of mitotic-associated apoptotic cells for mock treatment was 1%, 4% for
treatment with 10 nM GSK461364A, 2% for treatment with retinoids alone, and 33% for treatment with both GSK461364A and retinoids.

sequence, they might have different measurement errors
and qualities. If we take the average, the good probe might
be compromised by the relatively bad probe. So we sought
to use the probe with higher signal to noise to represent
the shRNA. To determine which probe has higher quality,
we define an index SNR (signal to noise ratio) as:
between group variability

Cell biology assays
GSK461364A treatment was for three days followed
by a washout of the compound and recovery in growth
medium for three to seven days. GSK461364A was
removed from plates by three washes with 20% FBSsupplemented complete medium. To test for combination
treatment of retinoids with GSK461364A, 1,000-3,000
cells were plated in clear-bottom 96-well plates (Corning).
Following retinoid (1 micromolar All-trans-retinoic acid,
ATRA; 1 micromolar 9-cis-retinoic acid, 9cRA, Sigma)
pre-treatment for 96 hours, the cells were cultured in the
presence of retinoids and GSK461364A or DMSO vehicle
for 72 hours. The drugs were then removed by washing 3X
with cell culture medium supplemented with 20% FBS,
followed by post-treatment with retinoids or DMSO for
an additional 72 hours. The cells were stained with MTT
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] colorimetric reagent and solubilized following
the manufacturerâs instructions (Roche) and subjected
to automated plate reading (Victor3, PerkinElmer) at
OD 595nm following the manufacturerâs instructions.
To assay for mitotic arrest and apoptosis, A549 cells
were plated on cover slips followed by treatment of 1
micromolar retinoids plus GSK461364A (IC20), retinoids
alone, or GSK461364A alone, or DMSO. 72 hours
post drug treatment, the cells were ethanol-fixed and
propidium iodide stained, followed by flow cytometry
analysis for DNA content distribution. In parallel, 72
