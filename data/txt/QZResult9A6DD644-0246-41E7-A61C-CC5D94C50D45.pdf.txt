Abstract
TGF-b derived from bone fuels melanoma bone metastases by inducing tumor secretion of prometastatic
factors that act on bone cells to change the skeletal microenvironment. Halofuginone is a plant alkaloid
derivative that blocks TGF-b signaling with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties. Here, we show for
the ﬁrst time that halofuginone therapy decreases development and progression of bone metastasis caused by
melanoma cells through the inhibition of TGF-b signaling. Halofuginone treatment of human melanoma cells
inhibited cell proliferation, phosphorylation of SMAD proteins in response to TGF-b, and TGF-b–induced
SMAD-driven transcription. In addition, halofuginone reduced expression of TGF-b target genes that enhance
bone metastases, including PTHrP, CTGF, CXCR4, and IL11. Also, cell apoptosis was increased in response to
halofuginone. In nude mice inoculated with 1205Lu melanoma cells, a preventive protocol with halofuginone
inhibited bone metastasis. The beneﬁcial effects of halofuginone treatment were comparable with those
observed with other anti–TGF-b strategies, including systemic administration of SD208, a small-molecule
inhibitor of TGF-b receptor I kinase, or forced overexpression of Smad7, a negative regulator of TGF-b
signaling. Furthermore, mice with established bone metastases treated with halofuginone had signiﬁcantly
less osteolysis than mice receiving placebo assessed by radiography. Thus, halofuginone is also effective in
reducing the progression of melanoma bone metastases. Moreover, halofuginone treatment reduced
melanoma metastasis to the brain, showing the potential of this novel treatment against cancer metastasis.

Introduction
Melanoma, a malignant tumor that originates in melanocytes, is the sixth most common cancer in the United States (1).
The majority of patients with melanoma initially present with
localized disease; however, in advanced melanoma, cancer
cells metastasize to lungs, liver, brain, and frequently to bone
(2). Once melanoma metastasizes to bone, it is incurable. The
metastases cause severe pain, fractures, hypercalcemia, nerve
compression syndromes, and paralysis (3, 4). Melanoma cells in
bone secrete multiple factors that induce osteoclastic bone
destruction to release and activate growth factors stored in
mineralized bone matrix, which in turn stimulate tumor
growth and further bone destruction (5). TGF-b is the major

bone-derived factor responsible for driving a feed-forward
cycle of cancer metastasis in bone. TGF-b, stored in the bone
matrix, is released and activated during osteoclastic bone
resorption, and further induces tumor production of osteolytic
and prometastatic factors, such as parathyroid hormone–
related protein (PTHrP) and interleukin (IL)-11, which stimulate bone destruction, connective tissue growth factor
(CTGF) and VEGF-regulating angiogenesis, and the chemokine
receptor CXCR4, which causes tumors to home to bone (6, 7).
Although TGF-b is a tumor suppressor in normal epithelial
cells, it becomes a prometastatic factor in advanced cancer,
where it activates the epithelial–mesenchymal transition,
tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression.
Disruption of TGF-b signaling or neutralization of TGFb–regulated genes in cancer cells decreases bone metastases
in preclinical models (8–11).
Melanoma, like other human malignant tumors, secretes
large amounts of TGF-b, which in turn promotes resistance to
the TGF-b growth inhibitory effects (12–14) and metastatic
progression (15, 16). Elevated plasma concentrations of TGF-b
are associated with melanoma progression, and high levels of
TGF-b2 expression in malignant melanoma correlate with
tumor invasion in patients (17, 18). Preclinical studies showed
that treatment with the TbRI kinase inhibitor, SD208, caused a
reduction in osteolytic bone metastasis and TGF-b–regulated
metastatic genes in mice with melanoma and bone metastases

(10). Overexpression of the TGF-b–signaling inhibitor Smad7
in 1205Lu melanoma cells prevented metastasis to bone in
mice, and delayed the establishment and growth of melanoma
bone metastases (9). However, the in vitro and animal studies
described above have not yet led to clinical application. Indeed,
the treatment of metastatic melanoma has not changed substantially in more than a decade, and new strategies are
urgently needed.
Halofuginone is a modiﬁed plant alkaloid ﬁrst identiﬁed as
an inhibitor of ﬁbrosis that decreases type I collagen synthesis
(19, 20); it was tested in a recently completed phase II clinical
trial in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma and showed
efﬁcacy to reduce Kaposi sarcoma lesions (21). Halofuginone
inhibits TGF-b–dependent phosphorylation of Smad2/3 proteins and increases Smad7 expression (22). We hypothesize
that it could be effective against metastatic melanoma. Findings from extensive studies in animal models suggest that
halofuginone might be effective for the treatment of cancer and
ﬁbrotic diseases. Halofuginone decreased the growth of bladder carcinoma (23), glioma (24), prostate cancer (25), hepatocellular carcinoma (26), Wilms tumor (27), and malignancies of
brain (28) and pancreas (29).
Here, we investigated the potential of halofuginone to
reduce bone metastases from melanoma in a murine model.
Our ﬁndings suggest that halofuginone is a promising agent to
decrease metastasis of melanoma to bone.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
Human 501 mel and 888 mel cells were obtained from and
validated by the American Type Culture Collection by DNA
proﬁling. They were grown in RPMI medium supplemented
with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Human melanoma cell lines
1205Lu and WM852, derived from WM793 by serial passage
through athymic mice and selection of cells metastatic to the
lungs, and nodular melanoma metastases, respectively, were a
kind gift from Dr. M. Herlyn, Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA)
and have been previously described (10, 30). They were grown
in W489 medium composed of 3 parts MDCB153 and 1 part L15
with 4% FBS and antibiotics. The Smad7 overexpressing clone
(1205Lu-Smad7) was described previously (31). Halofuginone
(dl-trans-7-bromo-6-chloro-3-[3-(3-hydroxy-2piperidyl) acetonyl]-4(3H)-quinazolinone hydrobromide) was a gift from
Intervet Innovation GmbH. Stock solutions for in vitro studies
of 2 mg/mL were prepared by dissolving halofuginone in a
lactic acid buffer (0.44 mol/L, pH 4.3), and stored at 20 C (22).
For in vivo experiments, halofuginone (1 or 5 mg/0.1 mL) was
resuspended in PBS. SD208 was obtained from Scios, Inc.
Recombinant human TGF-b1 was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc.
Dual luciferase assay
Melanoma cells were transfected with pGL3-luc constructs
(Promega) expressing ﬁreﬂy luciferase either constitutively or
under the control of a TGF-b–induced reporter (CAGA)9-luc
(32) and with a phRL-CMV plasmid constitutively expressing
renilla luciferase (Promega) for normalization. Twenty-four
hours later, cells were pretreated with halofuginone for 4 hours,

followed by TGF-b1 (5 ng/mL) for 24 hours. Cells were lysed
using Passive Lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were
determined using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega).
Proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was assessed using a colorimetric assay
(MTT assay). 1205Lu cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of halofuginone (50–300 nmol/L)  TGF-b
(5 ng/mL). Next, MTT reagent (20 mL, 5 mg/mL) was added
to each well and incubated for 5 hours at 37 C followed by a
stop buffer (100 mL of HCl 0.01mol/L-10% SDS) to lyse the cells.
Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a Synergy HT
spectrophotometer (Biotek).
Apoptosis assay
Cell apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin V-EGFP Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioVision). Melanoma 1205Lu cells were
treated with increasing concentrations of halofuginone (50–
300 nmol/L) for 24, 48, or 72 hours. Melanoma 1205Lu cells
treated with H2O2 (8 mmol/L) overnight served as a positive
control. Cells were trypsinized and counted, and 5  105 cells
were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 mL of
binding buffer. Next, 5 mL of Annexin V-EGFP and 5 mL of
propidium iodide (PI) were added and incubated at room
temperature for 5 minutes in the dark. Cells were quantiﬁed
using a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Experiments were carried out in triplicate and for each sample and
15,000 events were collected and analyzed using FlowJo
software.
Western blot analysis
Cells were pretreated with halofuginone (200 nmol/L) for
4 hours followed by TGF-b1 (5 ng/mL) for 24 hours.
Samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE minigels and transferred
onto a Hybond-P membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Membranes were blocked in TBS-T-milk (5%) for 1 hour,
incubated overnight with primary antibody and for 1 hour
with secondary antibody. Protein detection was conducted
using Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore).
Antibodies against Phospho-Smad2 (Ser465/467), PhosphoSmad3 (Ser423/425), Smad2, and Smad3 were purchased from
Cell Signaling; anti b-actin antibody (Cell Signaling) was used
for normalization.
Gene expression analysis: RNA extraction and real-time
PCR
1205Lu cells were treated with halofuginone (200 nmol/L)
for 4 hours followed by TGF-b1 (5 ng/mL) for 24 hours. Total
RNA was isolated using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and reversetranscribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen). Resulting
cDNAs were processed for real-time PCR using QuantiTect
SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) and analyzed using a MyiQ
Single-color-Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) for
40 cycles (95 C for 15 s/58 C for 30 s/72 C for 30 s) after an
initial 15 minutes incubation at 95 C. Primers were optimized for real-time PCR (ampliﬁcation efﬁciency 100  5%).
Primer sequences used for the analysis were: PTHrP (sense,

Target gene
expression was normalized using housekeeping gene ribosomal protein L32 (RPL32). Samples were analyzed in triplicate and data analyzed using the DDCt method (33).
Animal experiments
Animal experiments were carried out at the University of
Virginia (Charlottesville, Virginia). Animal protocols were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
and were done in accordance with National and International
guidelines.
Intracardiac inoculation of tumor was conducted as previously described (34). Brieﬂy, 1205Lu melanoma cells were
resuspended to a ﬁnal concentration of 105 cells in 100 mL in
PBS. Tumor inoculation into the left cardiac ventricle was done
on an anesthetized mice positioned ventral side up. Development of osteolytic lesions in mice was followed weekly by
radiography using a Faxitron MX-20 with digital camera
(Faxitron X-ray Corporation). Lesion area was quantiﬁed using
the image analysis system MetaMorph software (Universal
Imaging Corporation).
Experimental design
Prevention protocol. Female nude mice were divided
into 6 groups (n ¼ 15 per group) identiﬁed as (i) PBS (vehicle
control), (ii) halofuginone 1 mg/mouse/d, (iii) halofuginone 5
mg/mouse/d, (iv) methylcellulose (1%), and (v) SD208 (60
mg/kg/d), according to the respective treatment. Groups 1
to 5 were inoculated with 1205Lu melanoma cells into the
left ventricle. Group 6, identiﬁed as Smad7, received 1205Lu–
Smad7 cells, a stable clone that overexpresses the inhibitory
protein Smad7, as previously described (31). All treatments
were initiated 2 days before melanoma cell inoculation. PBS
and halofuginone treatments (100 mL) were administered
daily by intraperitoneal injection. SD208 and its methylcellulose vehicle were administered daily by oral gavage. For
survival studies, mice were monitored daily and euthanized
when they presented signs of tumor-associated morbidity
such as severe loss of body weight, breathing troubles, or
paralysis.
Therapeutic protocol. Female nude mice were divided
into 3 groups (n ¼ 15 per group) and inoculated in the left
ventricle with 1205Lu cells. Osteolytic lesion progression in the
hindlimbs of the mice was followed using X-ray. Treatment
with PBS (100 mL) or halofuginone (1 or 5 mg/mouse/d)
intraperitoneally was initiated after osteolytic lesions were
detected (about 13  1 days after the intracardiac inoculation)
and continued until the end of the study.
Bone histology and histomorphometry
Hindlimbs were ﬁxed in formalin (10%) for 48 hours, decalciﬁed in EDTA (10%) for 2 weeks, and embedded in parafﬁn

for sectioning. Longitudinal, mid-sagittal sections 3.5 mm in
thickness were cut from the tibia and femur using an automated Microm HM 355S microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or for TRAP activity to
identify osteoclasts. All sections were visualized on a Leica DM
LB compound microscope (Leica Microsystems) with a QImaging Micropublisher Cooled charge-coupled device color
digital camera (Vashaw Scientiﬁc Inc.). Images were captured
and analyzed using BIOQUANT OSTEO software (Image Analysis Corporation). Tumor burden per bone was deﬁned as the
area of tibial and femoral bone occupied by cancer cells.
Osteoclast number at the tumor/bone interface (OC/mm bone
surface) was measured on TRAP-stained slides of femur and
tibia at 40 magniﬁcation.
Brain and soft tissue histology
In the prevention protocol, brain were collected from 5 mice
per group and ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin. Each brain was
cut coronally into 4 quarters and stained for Ki-67, a tumor cell
proliferation marker, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Abcam). We counted clusters of Ki-67–positive tumor
cells per total area in the cerebral cortex.
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were determined by 1-way or 2way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni posttest. Kaplan–Meier
survival curve data were analyzed by log-rank test. All the
results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v4.0 software,
expressed as mean  SEM, and P < 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.

Results
Halofuginone inhibits TGF-b signaling in 1205Lu human
melanoma cells
The effect of halofuginone on TGF-b signaling was examined using 1205Lu human melanoma cells transfected with
TGF-b-induced reporter (CAGA)9–luc (32), and treated with
increasing concentrations of halofuginone in the presence or
absence of TGF-b for 24 hours. As shown in Fig. 1A, halofuginone dose dependently inhibited TGF-b–induced promoter activity. Next, we determined by Western blotting the
effect of halofuginone pretreatment of 1205Lu cells at 3
different time points (1, 4, and 12 hours) on the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 protein in response to TGF-b. Halofuginone pretreatment by 4 and 12 hours followed by 30 minutes
of TGF-b treatment decreased the levels of phosphoSmad2
and phosphoSmad3 levels, whereas total Smad2/3 levels
remained unchanged (Fig. 1B). Halofuginone can induce the
mRNA expression of the TGF-b signaling inhibitor Smad7
in epithelial and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (22). Thus,
we studied the ability of halofuginone to induce expression
of Smad7 mRNA in melanoma cells. As shown in Fig. 1C,
halofuginone pretreatment of human 1205Lu cells for 4
hours followed by TGF-b treatment for 15 to 60 minutes
signiﬁcantly increased expression of Smad7 mRNA, whereas
the higher Smad7 mRNA expression was observed with
TGF-b treatment for 45 minutes or longer in the presence
of halofuginone.

Halofuginone reduces proliferation and induces
apoptosis of 1205Lu human melanoma cells
Halofuginone (50 or 100 nmol/L) signiﬁcantly reduced the
proliferation of 1205Lu cells when compared with untreated
cells (Fig. 1D). Treatment with higher doses of halofuginone
(200–300 nmol/L) completely prevented cell proliferation.
Presence or absence of TGF-b did not change the effect of
halofuginone on the proliferation of 1205Lu (Fig. 1D).
To determine whether halofuginone induce apoptosis in
1205Lu melanoma cells, cells where incubated with increasing
concentrations of halofuginone (50–300 nmol/L) and a ﬂow
cytometric annexin V-PI assay was conducted after 24, 48, and
72 hours. Halofuginone 200 and 300 nmol/L treatments for 48
and 72 hours signiﬁcantly induced cell death (Fig. 1E).
Halofuginone blocks TGF-b signaling in multiple human
melanoma cell lines
We tested the effects of halofuginone in 3 additional TGFb-responsive human melanoma cell lines: WM852, 501 mel,
and 888 mel (13). Halofuginone (200 nmol/L) treatment for 24
hours signiﬁcantly inhibited TGF-b–induced activity of the
(CAGA)9 promoter in all the melanoma lines analyzed (Fig. 2).

In contrast, halofuginone had no effect on cells transfected
with a constitutively active promoter, showing that at the
concentration tested, halofuginone was not having nonspeciﬁc
transcriptional effects. Furthermore, TGF-b–induced Smad2
phosphorylation was decreased by halofuginone treatment in
all 3-cell lines (Fig. 2).
Halofuginone reduces mRNA expression of TGFb–regulated bone metastasis–speciﬁc genes
Previous work identiﬁed a group of TGF-b–induced genes
that promote bone metastasis in breast cancer cells (6) as
well as in melanoma cells (9, 10). We examined whether
halofuginone can modulate the expression of bone metastasis–speciﬁc genes in 1205Lu melanoma cells. TGF-b treatment of 1205Lu cells resulted in the induction of mRNA
levels of PTHrP, CTGF, CXCR4, and IL11 (Fig. 3). Meanwhile,
cells treated with TGF-b in the presence of halofuginone
showed a reduction of mRNA levels of bone metastasis genes
compared with TGF-b alone (Fig. 3). Halofuginone-mediated
downregulation of the expression of TGF-b–regulated metastatic genes was similar to that of other TGF-b inhibitors
including the small-molecule inhibitor of TGF-b receptor I

Preventive treatment with halofuginone reduces
osteolytic metastases
To investigate the ability of halofuginone to prevent melanoma bone metastases in vivo, we used nude mice inoculated
with 1205Lu melanoma cells into the cardiac left ventricle (9).
Two doses of halofuginone (1 or 5 mg/mouse/d) were evaluated
in this prevention protocol. Drug treatment started 2 days
before intracardiac inoculation of cells and was continued
daily throughout the experiment. To compare the efﬁcacy of
halofuginone with another inhibitor of the TGF-b signaling
pathway and bone metastasis, mice were treated with SD208
(60 mg/kg/day, per os) as well as mice receiving the methylcellulose vehicle. In addition, mice were inoculated with
1205Lu–Smad7 cells that overexpressed the TGF-b signaling
inhibitor, Smad7, as a further control. Figure 4A and B shows

animals treated with PBS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
4A–B). As previously reported (10), treatment with SD208
signiﬁcantly decreased osteolytic lesions compared with vehicle-treated mice to a level comparable to 5 mg of halofuginone.
Similarly, overexpression of Smad7 protein protected the mice
from developing melanoma bone metastasis, as described
previously (9). Treatments with halofuginone or SD208 did
not increase the overall survival of the mice (Fig. 4C). However,
mice inoculated with 1205Lu cells overexpressing Smad7 had
signiﬁcantly improved survival compared with controls (Fig.
4C).
Halofuginone reduces the progression of established
osteolytic bone metastases
Next, we tested the ability of halofuginone to reduce osteolytic metastasis in a therapeutic protocol. Halofuginone was
administered after osteolytic lesions were detected on radiographs, 13 days after tumor cell inoculation. Nude mice were
then inoculated intraperitoneally daily with PBS or halofuginone (1 or 5 mg/mouse/d). Animals were euthanized at the
same time point to compare tumor burden between PBS- and
halofuginone-treated groups. Both doses of halofuginone

signiﬁcantly reduced the area of osteolytic lesions measured on
radiographs (Fig. 5A and C). Histomorphometric analysis
conﬁrmed that halofuginone reduced tumor area signiﬁcantly
(Fig. 5B and D). Because TGF-b–stimulated cancer cells
increase osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, we
measured the number of osteoclasts at the tumor–bone interface. Mice treated with halofuginone (5 mg/d) had a signiﬁcantly lower osteoclast number at the tumor–bone interface
compared with PBS-treated mice (Fig. 5E). Halofuginone
treatment did not have any effect on the total bone area when
compared with mice treated with PBS (Fig. 5F). These results
suggest that halofuginone inhibits melanoma bone metastases
through reduction of osteoclasts in addition to its action on
tumor cells.
Halofuginone decreases brain metastasis of 1205Lu
melanoma cells
1205Lu melanoma cells metastasize preferentially to bone,
but can also metastasize to other organs, including adrenal
glands, lungs, liver, skin, and brain after inoculation into the
cardiac left ventricle (9). We visualized 1205Lu cells on brain
tissue sections using Ki-67 immunostaining, a marker of
proliferating tumor cells. Mice were treated with or without

halofuginone (5 mg/mouse/d) or SD208 (60 mg/kg/d) in a
preventive protocol. We counted the number of tumor cell
clusters per total area.
Halofuginone treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the number of
brain metastases compared with mice treated with vehicle
(Fig. 6). In contrast, SD208 treatment did not reduce the
number of metastases to the brain, consistent with previous
ﬁndings that SD208 effects were speciﬁc to bone (10).

Discussion
Bone metastases are frequent complications of cancer,
occurring in up to 80% of patients with advanced breast or
prostate cancer, and in approximately 50% of patients with
advanced malignant melanoma (4, 35). TGF-b is a multifunctional cytokine with an established prometastatic role in
advanced cancer (36, 37). Blockade of TGF-b function can
interrupt multiple events important for the establishment and
maintenance of tumors (38, 39).
Previously, we showed that TGF-b plays a key role in the
establishment and progression of melanoma bone metastasis.
The overexpression of TGF-b signaling inhibitor Smad7 (9) or
the systemic administration of SD208, the small-molecule
inhibitor of TbRI kinase (10), inhibited TGF-b signaling,

thereby reducing expression of TGF-b–regulated metastatic
genes and delaying the progression of melanoma–bone metastasis. In this work, we searched for a pharmacologic way to
induce the inhibitory molecule Smad7 and focused on halofuginone, a plant alkaloid derivative that blocks TGF-b signaling in epithelial cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation and
activation of Smad2 and Smad3, and inducing Smad7 expression (22). Effects of the compound on tumor metastasis to bone
have not previously been reported. Here, we show for the ﬁrst
time that halofuginone is effective in an animal model of bone
metastasis produced by melanoma.
Inhibition of TGF-b signaling by halofuginone in melanoma
cells was shown as follows: (i) dose-dependent reduction of a
TGF-b–responsive reporter (CAGA)9-luc; (ii) inhibition of
Smad2/3 phosphorylation induced by TGF-b; (iii) induction
of Smad7, an inhibitor of TGF-b signaling, by halofuginone
alone and enhanced in the presence of TGF-b; and (iv)
inhibition of TGF-b–regulated genes PTHrP, CTGF, CXCR4,

and IL-11 that encode for metastatic and osteolytic factors
required for the establishment and development of bone
metastasis (6). Halofuginone inhibited cell proliferation and
induced apoptosis in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. In contrast to myeloma and leukemia cells, where
halofuginone induced apoptosis after 48 hours of treatment
(40, 41), the effect of halofuginone on 1205Lu melanoma cells
was mainly observed after 72 hours. This is consistent with the
fact that melanoma 1205Lu cells are often considered more
resistant to apoptosis than other cancer cell lines (42, 43). High
concentrations of halofuginone did not induce more than 20%
of cell death, suggesting that apoptosis is not the sole mechanism of action of halofuginone, yet it may contribute together
with inhibition of TGF-b signaling to the experimental therapeutic efﬁcacy of halofuginone against bone metastases.
In a mouse model of bone metastasis, systemic halofuginone
treatment reduced the establishment of melanoma bone
metastases, signiﬁcantly reducing osteolytic lesion area.

Halofuginone inhibitory effects on skeletal metastasis of melanoma cells were similar to those of SD208 or Smad7 protein
overexpression by a stable cell clone (9, 10). Halofuginone
treatment did not improve mouse survival, although in this
setting, there was no signiﬁcant effect on the survival of mice
using SD208 treatment. Notably, mice inoculated with cancer
cells overexpressing Smad7 protein survived for more than 2
months, as seen in past studies (9), compared with mice treated
with halofuginone or SD208, that started dying after 5 weeks.
These results suggest that the effect of halofuginone on bone

6254

Cancer Res; 72(23) December 1, 2012

metastases may not be entirely due to Smad7, or that pronounced overexpression of Smad7 in excess of that achieved
with halofuginone may have independent effects on tumor
metastases. Halofuginone has systemic effects and could
induce Smad7 in the host as well as the tumor, whereas Smad7
overexpression in the tumor cells alone may result in tumor
cell–speciﬁc alterations, which may explain differences in
survival.
Indeed, the precise mechanism of action of halofuginone
still remains unclear and could involve factors other than
Smad7. Roffe and colleagues showed that halofuginone modulates the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways causing the
inhibition of Smad3 phosphorylation (44). In mouse models of
pancreatic ﬁbrosis and acute promyelocytic leukemia, halofuginone treatment increased N-terminal phosphorylation of cjun kinase, inhibiting TGF-b signaling and cell proliferation
(40, 45). In recent studies, halofuginone activated the amino
acid starvation response pathway in vivo, and altered differentiation of TH17 cells (46). Whether halofuginone activates
this starvation response in melanoma cells and whether this
can affect the development of bone metastases has not yet been
studied. Furthermore, TH17 cells have been implicated in
tumor immunology and may be a target for cancer therapy.
Increased inﬁltration of IL-17þ T cells correlated with poor
survival in patients having hepatocellular carcinoma (47), and
IL-17 from T cells protects breast cancer cells from apoptosis
and increases metastases (48). However, our experimental
model used nude mice lacking T cells. We would need to use
a syngeneic model to determine the effect of halofuginone on
TH17 and the development of bone metastases.
A highlight of our ﬁndings with halofuginone was its ability
to reduce tumor growth and tumor progression when bone
metastatic lesions were already established. Current therapies
for the treatment of bone metastases (e.g., bisphosphonates
and anti-RANKL antibody) improve the skeletal morbidity but
do not cure or cause regression of the established bone
metastases, so more effective therapies are needed. Halofuginone treatment reduced the number of osteoclasts at the
tumor–bone interface, which could be due to decreased
expression of pro-osteolytic genes by cancer cells treated with
halofuginone or to a direct effect of halofuginone on osteoclast
and their precursors. TGF-b signaling also stimulates osteoclastogenesis, and inhibitors of TGF-b decrease bone resorption and osteoclast number in normal bone (49). Thus, halofuginone may be beneﬁcial alone or in combination with other
bone-targeted antiresorptive therapy.
Halofuginone also reduced melanoma metastasis to the
brain, showing that its effects are not limited to bone and
bone metastases, unlike the effects of other inhibitors of TGF-b
signaling. In mice, disruption of TGF-b signaling with a truncated form of TGF-b type II receptor in breast cancer cells, with
overexpression of Smad7 in 1205Lu melanoma cells, or with
SD208, a speciﬁc inhibitor of TGF-b type I receptor kinase
domain, did not have anticancer effects outside of bone. Thus,
the anticancer effect of halofuginone cannot be explained
solely by the inhibition of TGF-b signaling pathway.
In summary, halofuginone inhibits TGF-b signaling and
TGF-b–regulated prometastatic genes in vitro. Systemic

administration of halofuginone in a mouse model reduced the

cells. More importantly, halofuginone therapy reduced the
progression of established osteolytic bone metastasis in mice,
showing its potential as a therapeutic agent. Halofuginone is a
novel treatment for metastases that could rapidly be brought
to the clinic for the treatment of patients with malignant
melanoma.
