Abstract
Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is a promising drug target in malignancy. The
structure of MT1-MMP includes the hemopexin domain (PEX) that is distinct from and additional to the catalytic
domain. Current MMP inhibitors target the conserved active site in the catalytic domain and, as a result, repress
the proteolytic activity of multiple MMPs instead of MT1-MMP alone. In our search for noncatalytic inhibitors of
MT1-MMP, we compared the protumorigenic activity of wild-type MT1-MMP with an MT1-MMP mutant lacking
PEX (DPEX). In contrast to MT1-MMP, DPEX did not support tumor growth in vivo, and its expression resulted in
small ﬁbrotic tumors that contained increased levels of collagen. Because these ﬁndings suggested an important
role for PEX in tumor growth, we carried out an inhibitor screen to identify small molecules targeting the PEX
domain of MT1-MMP. Using the Developmental Therapeutics Program (National Cancer Institute/NIH), virtual
ligand screening compound library as a source and the X-ray crystal structure of PEX as a target, we identiﬁed and
validated a novel PEX inhibitor. Low dosage, intratumoral injections of PEX inhibitor repressed tumor growth and
caused a ﬁbrotic, DPEX-like tumor phenotype in vivo. Together, our ﬁndings provide a preclinical proof of
principle rationale for the development of novel and selective MT1-MMP inhibitors that speciﬁcally target the
PEX domain. Cancer Res; 72(9); 2339–49. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is
an archetype of membrane-type MMPs (1). MT1-MMP expression is associated with multiple pathophysiologic conditions,
including tumor cell invasion (2–6). In migrating cells, MT1MMP accumulates at the leading and trailing edges to contribute efﬁciently to matrix cleavage and cell locomotion (7, 8).
MT1-MMP is regulated both as a proteinase and as a membrane protein by coordinated mechanisms including activation of the MT1-MMP proenzyme, inhibition by tissue inhibitor
of metalloproteinase (TIMP), self-proteolytic inactivation,
homodimerization, trafﬁcking throughout the cell to the plasma membrane, the internalization into the transient compartment inside the cells and recycling back to the plasma membrane [reviewed in (9, 10)]. These events stimulate intracellular
cytoskeleton rearrangements and set in motion cellular invasion machinery.
There is a consensus among researchers that invasionpromoting MT1-MMP plays the pivotal and multiple roles in

tumor progression and metastasis, especially in cell invasion
and directional cell motility (6). The MT1-MMP multidomain
structure includes the N-terminal prodomain, the catalytic
domain (CAT), the hinge linker, the hemopexin domain (PEX),
the transmembrane, and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains
(11). MT1-MMP is synthesized as a latent zymogen that
requires proteolytic processing of the N-terminal inhibitory
prodomain to generate the mature enzyme (12, 13).
CAT is the most important domain for the protumorigenic
MT1-MMP function (14–16). PEX, however, is also crucial for
many speciﬁc MMP functions (17–19). In MMPs, including
MT1-MMP, the PEX structure is a 4-bladed b-propeller (20).
PEX is essential for the association, the lateral diffusion, and
the proteolysis of the underlying collagen substratum by MT1MMP (19, 21). PEX is directly involved in MT1-MMP homodimerization and interactions with CD44, TIMP-2, and MMP-2
(22–24). According to the results by others, blade IV of PEX is
necessary for MT1-MMP homodimerization while blade I is
required for heterodimerization with CD44 (20, 25). In the
symmetrical MT1-MMP homodimer, blades II and III of
the ﬁrst monomer seems to interact with blades III and II of
the second monomer while in the asymmetrical homodimer
the contacts involve blades I/II and I/II/III/IV of the monomers
(20). The requirement of PEX in the MMP-2 activation process
also remains insufﬁciently understood. In a few studies, MT1MMP lacking PEX was capable of accomplishing MMP-2
activation (26, 27). Other studies suggested that homodimerization and MMP-2 activation were interconnected (20, 28, 29).
To shed more light on PEX's function, we compared
the proinvasive, protumorigenic capacity of the wild-type

MT1-MMP and MT1-MMP mutant lacking PEX. Because our
results pointed to an important, albeit underestimated, role of
PEX in the MT1-MMP–dependent tumorigenesis, we also
identiﬁed a small molecule, PEX-targeting inhibitor. This
inhibitor selectively targeted PEX and, as a result, repressed
the protumorigenic function of MT1-MMP.

Materials and Methods
General reagents and antibodies
Reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless indicated otherwise. Murine monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal
MT1-MMP antibodies (3G4 and Ab8345, respectively) and a
hydroxamate inhibitor (GM6001) were from Chemicon. Rat tail
type I collagen (COL-I) was from BD Biosciences. Rabbit
polyclonal antibodies to Ki-67 and COL-I were from Thermo
Scientiﬁc and Novus Biologicals, respectively. A murine monoclonal V5 antibody was from Invitrogen.
Cells
All of the original cell lines were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection in 2011. Human breast carcinoma
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's
modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM)-10% FBS. Human mammary epithelial 184B5 cells were maintained in mammary epithelial cell growth medium (MEGM; Invitrogen). 184B5 cells
stably transfected with the original pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO lentiviral vector (184B5 cells) or the lentiviral vector encoding the
MT1-MMP C-terminally tagged with a V5 tag (185B5-MT cells)
were constructed earlier (30). MCF-7 cells stably expressing the
wild-type MT1-MMP (MCF7-MT cells), MT1-MMP C-terminally tagged with a V5 tag (MCF7-MT-V5 cells) or the b3
integrin subunit (MCF7-b3/zeo cells) alone or coexpressing
the latter with MT1-MMP (MCF7-b3/MT cells) or the MT1MMP mutant lacking the 319–508 PEX sequence (MCF7-b3/
DPEX cells) were obtained earlier (12, 27, 30–32).
Cleavage of ﬂuorescent peptide
CAT was expressed in E. coli, puriﬁed from the inclusion
bodies, and refolded to restore its native conformation (33).
The activity assay was conducted at 37 C in triplicate in
wells of a 96-well plate in 0.2 mL 50 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.5
containing 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 50 mmol/L ZnCl2, 20% glycerol,
the (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-(3-[2,4dinitrophenyl]-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl)-Ala-Arg-NH2 ﬂuorescent substrate (10 mmol/L; Bachem) and CAT (10 nmol/L;
ref. 34). Reaction velocity was monitored at lex ¼ 320 nm and
lem ¼ 400 nm. The increasing concentrations of the compounds were coincubated for 30 minutes with CAT at ambient
temperature. The residual activity of CAT was measured. IC50
values were calculated by determining the compound concentrations that inhibited the cleavage activity by 50%.
Cell viability assays
Assays were conducted in wells of a 96-well ﬂat bottom,
white wall plates. 184B5-MT and MCF7-b3/MT cells (5  104)
were grown for 16 hours in MEGM-10% FBS and DMEM-10%
FBS, respectively. 184B5-MT cells were replenished with fresh

2340

MEGM (0.1 mL per well) and incubated for an additional 24
hours in the presence of the compounds (100 mmol/L) or
vehicle (1% dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO). MCF7-b3/MT cells
were replenished with fresh DMEM-10% FBS (0.1 mL per well)
and incubated for an additional 6 hours in the presence of the
compounds (400 mmol/L) or vehicle (2% DMSO). The viable
cells were counted using a luminescent ATP-Lite assay (PerkinElmer). Each datum point represented the results of at least
3 independent experiments carried out in triplicate.
Migration assays
Assays were conducted in wells of a 24-well, 8 mm pore size
Transwell plate (Corning Costar). A 6.5-mm insert membrane
was coated with 0.1 mL COL-I (300 mg/mL in MEGM) and then
air dried for 16 hours. The collagen coating was rehydrated for
1 hour in 0.2 mL MEGM. The inner chamber contained MEGM10% FBS as a chemoattractant. The compounds (10–100 mmol/
L) or DMSO (0.1%–1%) were added to both inner and outer
chambers. Before plating in the outer chamber, cells (5  104)
were coincubated for 20 minutes with the compounds or
DMSO in MEGM. Cells were allowed to migrate for 16 to 18
hours. The cells remaining on the top surface of the membrane
were removed with a cotton swab. The cells on the bottom
surface of the membrane were ﬁxed and stained (0.2% crystal
violet). The incorporated dye was extracted with 1% SDS and
the A570 was measured. Data are means  SE from 3 individual
experiments conducted in triplicate.
Adhesion assays
Assays were conducted in wells of a 96-well clear bottom
well plate. Wells were coated for 16 to 18 hours at 4 C using 150
mL COL-I, Matrigel, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions
(50 mg/mL, 100 mg/mL and 1%, respectively, in PBS). Wells were
blocked for 1 hour with 1% BSA. Cells were coincubated for 15
minutes at 37 C with the compounds (25–100 mmol/L). Cells
(1  105/0.1 mL) were then allowed to adhere to the wells for 1
hour at 37 C. Unattached cells were removed by washings.
Attached cells were ﬁxed and stained (0.2% crystal violet). The
incorporated dye was extracted using 1% SDS and the A570 was
measured. Data are means  SE from 3 individual experiments
carried out in triplicate.
Collagen degradation assays
Assays were conducted in wells of a 24-well culture plates.
Wells were coated for 1 hour at 37 C with neutralized, chilled
rat tail COL-I (0.2 mg/mL, 0.25 mL in DMEM). Cells were
coincubated for 20 minutes at 37 C with the compounds (100
mmol/L) or 1% DMSO. Cells (2.5  104 per well) were then
seeded on COL-I and cultured for 3 days. Cells were detached
with 2 mmol/L EDTA. Collagen was ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with Coomassie Blue, and the images were
captured using a Nikon TE-2000 microscope with a 20
objective and a CCD camera.
Pull down and Western blotting
Cells grown in wells of a 12-well plate were lysed with 50
mmol/L N-octyl-b-D-glucopyranoside in TBS supplemented
with 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulphonyl ﬂuoride, 10 mmol/L

EDTA, and a protease inhibitor cocktail set III (buffer A).
Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 
g; 15 minutes). The supernatant aliquots (4 mg total protein)
were analyzed by Western blotting with the MT1-MMP, FLAG,
V5, and actin antibodies followed by the secondary horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch)
and a SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate kit
(Pierce). Where indicated, GM6001 (50 mmol/L) was added to
the cells 24 hours before cell lysis.
For pull-down experiments, MCF7-MT and MCF7-MT-V5
cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA3.1-zeo
plasmid encoding the FLAG-tagged MT1-MMP construct
(32). Cells were coincubated for 24 hours with the compounds (100 mmol/L) or DMSO (1%). In 48 hours posttransfection, the cells were lysed with buffer A. Insoluble material
was removed by centrifugation (14,000  g; 15 minutes). The
supernatant aliquots (200 mg total protein) were coincubated for 16 hours with the FLAG M2 antibody beads (10 mL;
50% slurry). The beads were collected by centrifugation and
washed in buffer A. The FLAG construct was eluted from the
beads using the FLAG peptide (20 mL; 150 mg/mL; 1 hour).
The beads were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant
samples were then analyzed by Western blotting with the V5
antibody.
Gelatin zymography
Cells (2  105) were grown for 24 hours in DMEM-10% FBS
in wells of a 24-well plate. The medium was replaced with
fresh DMEM (0.2 mL per well), and cells were incubated for
16 to 18 hours. Where indicated, the medium was supplemented with the MMP-2 proenzyme (0.5 nmol/L). In 24
hours, medium aliquots (20 mL) were analyzed by gelatin
zymography.
To analyze the status of MMP-2 in tumor xenografts, snapfrozen tumors (0.1 mg tissue) were extracted in 1 mL 20
mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, a protease inhibitor cocktail set III, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, and 10
mmol/L EDTA. The pellet was removed by centrifugation
(14,000  g; 30 minutes). The protein concentration was then
equalized among the samples (1 mg/mL). To determine the
status of MMP-2, the samples (5 mg total protein) were analyzed by gelatin zymography.
Tumor xenografts
On day 1, MCF7-b3/WT and MCF7-b3/DPEX cells (4 
105) were injected subcutaneously in 0.1 mL DMEM containing 3 mg/mL Matrigel into the mammary tissue of athymic
BALB/c nu/nu 4-week-old female mice (Charles River).
Because young, 4-week, female mice produce high levels of
estrogen, no additional estrogen supplementation is
required to support the growth of estrogen-dependent MCF7
cells. Tumors were measured weekly by caliper measurements of 2 perpendicular diameters of xenografts (D1 and
D2). Tumor volume was calculated with the formula: V ¼ p/6
(D1  D2)3/2. Starting on day 29, mice received intratumoral
injections of compound 9 (0.5 mg/kg; 3 times per week).
Control animals received vehicle injections (2% DMSO). On

www.aacrjournals.org

day 46, animals were sacriﬁced according to the NIH guidelines. Tumors were excised and either freeze molded in
optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura
Finetek) or embedded in parafﬁn. Tumor sections were
stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and with the
antibodies to MT1-MMP, Ki-67, and COL-I followed by the
secondary antibody conjugated with red Alexa Fluor 594
(Molecular Probes). Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI.
The ﬂuorescence images were acquired using an Olympus
BX51 ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a MagnaFire
camera.
RT-PCR
To measure the expression levels of human MT1-MMP, Ki67, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (loading
control), total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and
tumors using TRIzol reagent and additionally puriﬁed using
the RNeasy columns (QIAGEN). The RNA purity was estimated
by measuring the A260/280 and the A260/230 ratios. The integrity
of the RNA samples was validated with an Experion automated
electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). The RNA templates (50 ng)
were used in the 25 mL reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR reactions supplemented with the corresponding forward and
reverse primers (0.6 mmol/L each) using the OneStep RT-PCR
system (QIAGEN; ref. 12). After the completion of the ﬁrst
strand synthesis, RT-PCR was carried out for 35 cycles (denaturation at 95 C, annealing at 55 C, and elongation at 72 C; 30,
30, and 60 seconds, respectively). The ampliﬁed products were
separated with agarose gel electrophoresis.
Protein-ligand docking
The protein-ligand docking simulations were carried out
with the MT1-MMP crystal structure coordinates from PDB
3C7X as a target and an approximately 275,000 compound
library of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP)
National Cancer Institute/NIH as a source of small-molecule
ligands. The docking into the druggable pocket was carried out
using Q-MOL modeling package (35). The PDB 3C7X molecule
preparation included adding of hydrogen atoms and the
assignment of the standard Optimized Potential for Liquid
Simulations (OPLS) atom types (36). The ligand structures
were prepared for docking using the Q-MOL small-molecule
minimization protocol. Polyphenols and compounds with
either a molecular mass below 220 Da or chlorine atoms
attached to aliphatic carbons and compounds that failed
minimization were discarded. The crystal structure was treated as a set of grid-based potentials. The minimized ligand
structures were docked with a Monte Carlo simulation in the
internal coordinate space of the crystal structure. The identiﬁed hits were ranked according to their binding energy. The
resulting hits with the lowest binding energy were selected for
our further studies.
Compound databases
The compound databases were obtained from "The DTP/
NCI Open Chemical Repository." The compounds were more
than 95% pure as certiﬁed by the DTP/NCI Services. The
ligands were dissolved in 100% DMSO and stored at 20 C.

Structure modeling
The predicted binding mode of compound 9 in a complex
with PEX (PDB 3C7X) was built using the Q-MOL full atom
ﬂexible protein-ligand docking in the internal coordinates. The
protein y, j, and c angles of all of the amino acid residues,

which are within a 7.5A distance from ligand atoms, were
allowed to change while the positional and rotable torsion
variables of a ligand molecule were unﬁxed.

Results
Role of PEX in tumor growth
To investigate the tumorigenic role of PEX, we selected
MCF7-b3/MT and MCF7-b3/DPEX cells. Normally, nonmigratory MCF-7 cells do not express MMP-2, MT1-MMP, and the b3
integrin. Expression of the b3 integrin subunit reconstitutes
the avb3 integrin on the MCF-7 cell surface. Compared with
the MT1-MMP expression alone, coexpression of MT1-MMP
with the b3 integrin subunit confers an invasive phenotype on
MCF-7 cells (31, 37, 38). MCF7-b3/MT and MCF7-b3/DPEX
cells expressed a similar level of the mature MT1-MMP enzyme
(as detected by the 3G4 antibody to CAT). Because of MT1MMP self-proteolysis, degradation species were present in
both MCF7-b3/MT and MCF7-b3/DPEX cells (as detected by
the Ab1815 antibody to the hinge). According to the gelatin
zymography analysis, both cell types were similarly efﬁcient in
activating the MMP-2 proenzyme. The expression level of MT1-

2342

Cancer Res; 72(9) May 1, 2012

MMP and the ability to activate MMP-2 by MCF7-b3/zeo cells
were negligible (39; Fig. 1A).
In our in vivo studies, cells (4  105) were embedded in
Matrigel and then xenografted into young immunodeﬁcient
female mice (n ¼ 5–6). The size of the developing tumors was
measured weekly for 46 days. Following an approximately 20day lag period, MCF7-b3/MT xenografts acquired a rapid
growth rate. In turn, the size of MCF7-b3/DPEX tumors
(25–30 mm3) remained continually low. At day 46, the
MCF7-b3/MT tumor volume was approximately 40-fold larger
than that of MCF7-b3/DPEX tumors (Fig. 1B).
Microscopic examination revealed extensive vascularization
and inﬁltration of T cells in MCF7-b3/MT xenografts both at
the periphery and in the central regions of the tumors. There
was a limited development of blood vessels in the central
regions of MCF7-b3/DPEX tumors. The inﬁltration of T cells
was also reduced in MCF7-b3/DPEX tumors compared with
MCF7-b3/MT xenografts. There were additional differences
between the 2 tumor types. Thus, MCF7-b3/DPEX tumors
seemed ﬁbrotic with an increased level of the stroma and
connective tissues, but with less tumor cells (Fig. 1C).
Immunostaining conﬁrmed the presence of high levels of
COL-I in MCF7-b3/DPEX tumors. In turn, the reduced levels of
COL-I were evident in MCF7-b3/MT xenografts. MT1-MMP
immunoreactivity was detected in the central and peripheral
regions in MCF7-b3/MT tumors. MT1-MMP was mainly
observed at the edges of MCF7-b3/DPEX xenografts. Ki-67

immunostaining conﬁrmed the presence of proliferating
human carcinoma cells in both tumor types (Fig. 2A).
Gelatin zymography of MCF7-b3/MT and MCF7-b3/DPEX
tumor extracts supported these observations. Although the
normal mammary tissue specimens did not activate the 68 kDa
MMP-2 proenzyme, the 62 kDa MMP-2 mature enzyme was
readily observed in MCF7-b3/DPEX xenografts and, especially,
in MCF7-b3/MT tumors. The presence of the human MT1MMP and Ki-67 transcripts in MCF7-b3/MT and MCF7-b3/
DPEX xenografts were also conﬁrmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 2B).
We concluded that PEX is essential for both the efﬁcient
MT1-MMP proteolysis and the tumor growth. Naturally, if PEX
was absent in the MT1-MMP structure, the proteolytically
competent MT1-MMP DPEX mutant was largely incapable of
degrading COL-I and promoting tumor growth. Our results
support and extend the ﬁndings by others who suggested that
PEX was essential for cleaving COL-I ﬁbers at the cell surface
(22).
Small-molecule compounds targeting PEX
We hypothesized that it would be exceedingly difﬁcult to
identify small-molecule inhibitors that would directly bind the
PEX dimerization interface and that would interfere with the
multicontact PEX homodimerization interface. Instead, we
attempted to identify allosteric rather than competitive inhibitors of homodimerization. For this purpose, we selected a
druggable pocket-like site in the center of the PEX structure.
This site is largely formed by b-strands 1 of blades I to IV and it
is distinct from the PEX dimerization interface (Fig. 3A).
The diverse 275,000 compound DTP/NCI database was
screened using the Q-MOL software against the docking site
using the X-ray structure of MT1-MMP (PDB 3C7X). As a result,
top ranking 19 hits were identiﬁed, ordered from the DTP/NCI,
and analyzed further. To select the most efﬁcient compound
(s), we used multiple enzyme and cell-based tests, which are
summarized in Fig. 3B and shown in more detail in Figs. 4
and 5.
First, we determined whether the compounds were capable
of interacting with CAT and inhibiting its catalytic activity. On
the basis of our measurements, we discarded compounds 2, 3,

www.aacrjournals.org

6–8, 10, 11, 18, and 19 the IC50 values of which were below 20
mmol/L (Fig. 4). Compounds 1, 5, 9, and 12–17, which did not
affect the cleavage activity were studied further.
Next, we determined whether the compounds affected cell
viability. Because normal cells are more sensitive relative to
cancer cells, we used normal mammary epithelial 184B5-MT
cells in our tests. The original 184B5 cells were obtained from

normal augmentation mammoplasty material and immortalized by exposure to benzo(a)pyrene (40). These normal cells are
neither malignant nor tumorigenic in immunodeﬁcient mice
(30). Compounds 16 and 17 exhibited cell toxicity and were
then discarded. Compounds 1, 5, 9, and 12–15 were analyzed
further (Fig. 5A).
We then established if the compounds were capable of
affecting cell migration on COL-I. Nonmigratory MCF-7 cells
could not be rationally used in these experiments. Instead, we
used migratory 184B5-MT cells that stably expressed high
levels of MT1-MMP (Fig. 5B). Original 184B5 cells do not
produce MT1-MMP and do not migrate on COL-I. Following
transfection with MT1-MMP, the resulting 184B5-MT cells
expressed high levels of the proteinase and acquired an ability
to migrate on COL-I. Among the 7 compounds we tested,

2344

Cancer Res; 72(9) May 1, 2012

compounds 5, 9, and 14 repressed migration of 184B5-MT cells
on COL-I in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). We next
retested the inhibitory potency of compounds 5, 9, and 14
using breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells. These cells are
naturally invasive regardless of minor levels of MT1-MMP (Fig.
5B). Compounds 9 and 14, as expected, did not show any
inhibitory effect in MDA-MB-231 cells. Compound 5, however,
inhibited migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting an offtarget effect (Fig. 5D).
We next determined the ability of compounds 5, 9, and 14 to
inhibit adhesion of 184B5-MT on the Matrigel and COL-I

not affect cell adhesion, compound 5, because of its off-target
effect, inhibited adhesion of cells on both substrates (Fig. 5E).
The data in MDA-MB-231 cells were similar (not shown). Based

on these results, we discarded compound 5. Compounds 9 and
14 were studied further.
Compound 9 affects the PEX function
We next determined whether compounds 9 and 14 affected
homodimerization of MT1-MMP. For this purpose, we used
MCF7-MT-V5 cells that were transiently transfected with the
MT1-MMP-FLAG construct. MCF7-MT cells that expressed
MT1-MMP without a V5 tag served as a control. In 24 hours
posttransfection, the cells were coincubated with compounds
9 and 14 for the next 24 hours and then lysed. The MT1-MMPFLAG construct was pulled down with anti-FLAG beads. The
levels of coprecipitated MT1-MMP-V5 were then measured in
the pull down samples using Western blotting with the V5
antibody. Compound 9, but not compound 14, signiﬁcantly
reduced the levels of coprecipitated MT1-MMP-V5 in the pull
down samples (Fig. 5F). We concluded that compound 9
directly interacted with PEX in the full-length MT1-MMP

structure and that these interactions affected PEX
homodimerization.
To conﬁrm that the catalytic activity of cellular full-length
MT1-MMP was not affected by compound 9, we coincubated
184B5-MT cells with both the MMP-2 proenzyme (23) and
compound 9. The activation level of MMP-2 was then
observed with gelatin zymography. This test conﬁrmed that
compound 9 did not inhibit the catalytic function of cellular
MT1-MMP (Fig. 5G). In addition, compound 9 did not inhibit
the catalytic activity of MMP-2 (not shown). As a result of
our tests, compound 9 was selected over 14 for our subsequent xenograft studies in mice.
Compound 9 affects protumorigenic MT1-MMP in vivo
The in vivo effects of compound 9 were assessed with MCF7b3/MT cells. Cells (4  105) were embedded in Matrigel and
xenografted into immunodeﬁcient mice (n ¼ 5). On day 29,
when the tumors reached a 40 to 80 mm3 size, a low, 0.5 mg/kg,

amount of compound 9 (from a 400 mmol/L stock in PBS) was
injected intratumorally. Because of its limited solubility, higher
concentrations of compound 9 in aqueous solutions could not
be reached. Control mice received vehicle alone. Injections
were continued 3 times per week for an additional 2 weeks. A
signiﬁcant reduction in tumor size (366  123 mm3) was
observed in the experimental group, while the tumor size
reached 933  169 mm3 in the control. We also showed that
compound 9 (400 mmol/L) did not show any cytotoxicity in
MCF7-b3/MT cells, suggesting that cancer cell death did not
affect tumor growth (Fig. 6A). At the end of the experiments,
MCF7-b3/MT xenografts were excised and analyzed.
Gelatin zymography of tumor extracts conﬁrmed that compound 9 did not affect the ability of MT1-MMP to activate
MMP-2 (Fig. 6B). H&E staining did not reveal any signiﬁcant
effect of compound 9 on xenograft angiogenesis when compared with control mice (Fig. 1C and 6C). There was no physical

damage and necrosis in the tumors following the compound 9
injections. Similar levels of the MT1-MMP and Ki-67 immunoreactivity were observed in the experimental and control
tumors. In turn, both the immunoreactivity and levels of COL-I
were signiﬁcantly enhanced in the experimental group (Fig.
6D). Notably, the collagen staining pattern in mice treated with
compound 9 became comparable with that in MCF7-b3/DPEX
tumors (Fig. 2A and 6D) suggesting that compound 9 repressed
the collagenolytic function of PEX.
To corroborate these results, we used a COL-I degradation
assay and MCF7-b3/MT cells to assess an inhibitory potency
of compound 9. As additional controls, we used MCF7-b3/
zeo cells that do not express MT1-MMP and MCF7-b3/DPEX
cells. Both MCF7-b3/zeo and MCF7-b3/DPEX cells were
incapable of COL-I degradation. In turn, MCF7-b3/MT cells
efﬁciently degraded the COL-I matrix. Compound 9 dramatically reduced the collagenolytic activity in MCF7-b3/MT

cells (Fig. 6E). This result was consistent with our
expectations.
PEX-ligand complex modeling
To visualize the interactions of compound 9 with PEX, we
modeled the compound-PEX complex using the PDB 3C7X as a
template (Fig. 7). Our results suggested that compound 9 is in a
vicinity of Met-328, Arg-330, Asp-376, Met-422, and Ser-470 of
the druggable pocket. The latter is formed by the internal
portions of the 4 polypeptide chains the external portions of
which shape blades I to IV. Based on our modeling, it is
tempting to hypothesize that the binding of compound 9
affected the conformation and ﬂexibility of blades I to IV of
the b-propeller and, as a result, decreased the PEX-dependent
homodimerization of cellular MT1-MMP.

Discussion
MT1-MMP is essential to pericellular proteolysis and cell
invasion (1). MT1-MMP is a multidomain enzyme that exhibits
several structural domains. These domains are additional to
and distinct from CAT. The role of these domains in the net
proinvasive, protumorigenic function of MT1-MMP remained
unclear, especially for PEX. To record the function of PEX, we
designed the MT1-MMP construct lacking PEX and then, for
the ﬁrst time, characterize the DPEX mutant in the MT1MMP–dependent model of tumor growth. In contrast with
malignant cells, which expressed the wild-type MT1-MMP and
which generated the rapidly growing xenografts, the DPEX
tumors ceased growing after reaching a 25 to 30 mm3 size.
Additional distinctions were observed in the ﬁbrotic phenotype, the abundance of COL-I, and the reduced angiogenesis in
the DPEX tumors compared with the wild-type MT1-MMP
xenografts. These observation combined with the results by
others (19, 20, 22, 25, 28) led us to suggest that the DPEX mutant
was largely incapable of COL-I degradation and, hence, that
efﬁcient MT1-MMP proteolysis of COL-I was essential for
tumor growth in vivo.
It is established that homodimerization of MT1-MMP takes
place via PEX (22). The structure of PEX has been solved
recently (20). It became apparent that homodimerization
involves multiple residue interactions between the PEX monomers. Furthermore, homodimerization occurs in the course of
exocytosis of the de novo synthesized MT1-MMP rather than at
the cell surface (22). For this reason, we focused on the

www.aacrjournals.org

druggable pocket that was distinct from the PEX dimerization
interface.
For this purpose, we used virtual ligand screening using the
275,000 compound DTP/NCI library as a ligand source and the
X-ray structure of PEX as a target. Compounds were docked in
silico to the druggable pocket-like site. This pocket is distinct
from the PEX dimerization interface and localized in the center
of PEX at a roughly equal distance from blades I to IV. As a
result of our screens, we selected the top-ranking compounds,
ordered them from DTP/NCI, and tested using multiple in vitro
and cell-based assays. Consequently, we identiﬁed a novel
inhibitory compound that selectively targeted PEX, reduced
PEX homodimerization, and repressed MT1-MMP-mediated
cell migration and degradation of COL-I. This compound,
however, did not exhibit any observable off-target effects and
did not inhibit the cleavage activity of CAT, the efﬁciency of
MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP and cell adhesion to the COL-I
substratum.
The antitumor efﬁcacy of this PEX-targeting compound 9
(NSC405020) was directly shown in the in vivo tests. The low, 0.5
mg/kg, intratumoral injections of the compound signiﬁcantly
repressed tumor growth. Compound 9 injections also caused a
ﬁbrotic tumor phenotype and increased the level of COL-I. The
ﬁbrotic phenotype caused by the compound was similar to that
we observed in the DPEX tumors. These ﬁndings suggested
that the compound affected PEX and the ability of MT1-MMP
to function properly in degrading COL-I to support tumor cell
invasion. We have already identiﬁed additional, potent compounds of the same scaffold (Supplementary Table S1). Based
on our ADME studies, we are conﬁdent that compound
derivatives rather than the original compound 9 will be most
suitable for the subsequent systemic administration and the in
vivo PK studies.
We believe that our study, especially when combined with
the results of others (25, 41, 42), provides proof of concept for a
design of those non-CAT inhibitors that will selectively target
PEX and that will affect protumorigenic MT1-MMP in a
clinically beneﬁcial manner. In addition, as shown by the
pioneering work by others (18, 25, 41, 42), targeting PEX seems
to be a novel and promising approach to modulating the
function of other MMPs, including MMP-9, rather than
MT1-MMP alone. Overall, our proof of principle work provides
conceptual support to probe MT1-MMP PEX with small-molecule ligands and a rationale for design of selective PEXtargeting drugs.
