Abstract
In this study, we compared the effects of interleukin-2 (IL-2),
IL-15, and IL-21 on gene expression, activation of cell
signaling pathways, and functional properties of cells derived
from CD4+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Whereas both
IL-2 and IL-15 modulated, in a CTCL cell line, the expression
of >1,000 gene transcripts by at least 2-fold, IL-21 up-regulated
<40 genes. All three cytokines induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak3 in CTCL cell lines and native leukemic
(Sezary) cells. However, only IL-2 and IL-15 strongly activated
signal transducers and activators of transcription 5, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and mitogen-activated protein/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase/ERK signaling pathways in the cell lines and mitogen-primed native
cells. In contrast, IL-21 selectively activated signal transducers
and activators of transcription 3. Whereas all three cytokines
protected CTCL cells from apoptosis, only IL-2 and IL-15
promoted their proliferation. The effects of the cytokine
stimulation were Jak3 kinase– and Jak1 kinase– dependent.
These findings document the vastly different effect of IL-2 and
IL-15 versus IL-21 on CTCL cells. They also suggest two novel
therapeutic approaches to CTCL and, possibly, other CD4+
T-cell lymphomas: inhibition of the Jak1/Jak3 kinase complex
and, given the known strong immunostimulatory properties of
IL-21 on CD8+ T, natural killer, and B cells, application of this
cytokine to boost an immune response against malignant
CD4+ T cells. [Cancer Res 2008;68(4):1083–91]

and h chains and, similar to IL-2, also uses the third, IL-15–specific,
nontransducing a chain. Consequently, IL-2 and IL-15 share a
number of properties, including stimulation of T-cell, natural killer
(NK)–cell, and B-cell proliferation and functional maturation, but
certain features unique to each of these cytokines have also been
described (1, 2). IL-21 is also quite pleiotropic and displays a
spectrum of effects on immune cells (3), with its ability to increase
cytotoxicity of both NK (4) and CD8+ T cells (5) being the best
defined. The IL-21 receptor has, in addition to the gc, its own
distinct signal-transducing a chain. All three cytokines activate
Jak1 and Jak3 kinases that phosphorylate and, hence, activate the
respective cytokine receptors, as well as the signaling proteins that
dock to the activated receptors.
T-cell lymphomas represent a heterogeneous group of biologically and clinically distinct lymphoproliferative disorders with the
majority derived from the CD4+ helper/inducer T-cell subset.
Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) represent the most
frequently occurring type (6, 7); they display a tendency to progress
over time to the more advanced forms including development of
peripheral blood involvement, a leukemic phase also called Sezary
syndrome. The current study was aimed at comparing the effects of
IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21 on the CTCL cells with regard to modulation
of the gene expression, activation of signaling pathways, and cell
function. We have used in the study two CTCL-derived, IL-2–
dependent cell lines, Sez-4 (8) and SeAx (9), as well as the primary
leukemic (Sezary) CTCL cells.

Materials and Methods
Introduction
Among the several cytokines that signal through the receptors
that share the common g chain (gc), interleukin-2 (IL-2) is by far
the best characterized. It signals through the receptor that, in
addition to the gc chain, contains h chain, the second signaltransducing component and, in the case of high-affinity receptors,
also the IL-2–specific nonsignaling a chain. In normal immune
cells, IL-2 has been shown to activate Jak/signal transducers and
activators of transcription (STAT) signaling, phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK signaling pathways (1). IL-15 shares with IL-2 signaling via receptor with both gc

CTCL cell lines and patients and healthy donor CD4+ T cells. IL-2–
dependent T-cell lines Sez-4 and SeAx were derived from CTCL patients
(8, 9). The cell lines were cultured at 37jC and 5% CO2 in the presence of
200 units of IL-2 in standard RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sez-4) or 10% heat-inactivated human
serum (SeAx), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone mixture, and 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients and healthy
donors were obtained after Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation from
heparinized blood samples. The CTCL patients were diagnosed as having
peripheral blood involvement (leukemic phase/Sezary syndrome) on the
basis of clinical, histopathologic, and immunophenotypic criteria. The
leukemic CTCL cell populations of the four patients analyzed were >90%
pure as determined by flow cytometry analysis using the CD4/CD8 ratio and
CD7 and/or CD26 loss by the CD4+ T-cell population as the criteria. The
control, normal CD4+ T cells were purified from the mononuclear cell
population by negative purification using CD4+ T-cell isolation kit (Miltenyi
Biotec). The kit permitted removal of the non-CD4+ T lymphocytes by
applying a cocktail of biotin-conjugated antibodies against CD8, CD14,
CD16, CD20, CD36, CD43, and CD235a (glycophorin A) and avidin-coated
magnetic microbeads. To obtain primed cells, leukemic CTCL cells were
cultured for 7 days in the presence of a mitogen phytohemagglutinin

Figure 1. Expression profile of the genes induced by the gc-signaling cytokines
in CTCL cell line. CTCL-derived, IL-2–dependent Sez-4 cell line was deprived of
IL-2 for 16 h and cultured for 4 h in triplicate with medium or pretested saturating
doses of IL-2 (200 units), IL-15 (20 ng/mL), or IL-21 (100 ng/mL). After cell
harvest and total RNA isolation, the samples were checked for RNA quality,
reverse-transcribed to cDNA with simultaneous labeling, and hybridized to
Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2 arrays that contain DNA probes corresponding to
>47,000 gene coding sequences. The results were processed in GeneSpring
and further analyzed using Partek Genomics Suite, Spotfire, and GeneSpring
programs. A, gene expression pattern in the triplicate samples stimulated with
the depicted cytokines or medium alone (top ). Bottom, RNA quality control of the

(PHA-L; Sigma) used at 5Ag/mL. Donation of blood by patients and healthy
donors was conformed to the University of Pennsylvania Institutional
Review Board–approved protocols, and informed consent was obtained.
Cytokines. Recombinant human rhIL-2 (Bender MedSystems) was used
at the dose of 200 units, rhIL-15 (R&D Systems) at the dose of 20 ng/mL, and
rhIL-21 (Biosource) at 100 ng/mL.
Kinase inhibitors. Pan-Jak (Jak I; Calbiochem) is a quinolin derivative
with the structure 2-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-9-fluoro-3,6-dihydro-7H-benz[h]imidaz[4,5-f] isoquinolin-7-one. It inhibits enzymatic function of all four
members of the Jak family with the IC50 of 15 nmol/L for Jak1, 1 nmol/L for
Jak2, 5 nmol/L for Jak3, and 1 nmol/L for Tyk2 in in vitro kinase activity
inhibition assay (10). Jak3-specific inhibitor was synthesized according to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

the published structure (11) and displays the in vitro IC50 kinase activity
inhibition of Jak3 at 2 nmol/L for Jak3, 20 nmol/L for Jak2, and 100 nmol/L
for Jak1.
Gene expression analysis. Sez-4 cell line was starved of IL-2 for 16 h,
washed twice, and placed into six-well plates in 10 mL RPMI (10% FBS) for
2 h followed by addition of IL-2 (200 units), IL-15 (20 ng/mL), or IL-21
(100 ng/mL) or medium alone for 4 h. In the Jak-signaling inhibition
experiments, IL-2–starved Sez-4 cells were pretreated for 30 min with panJak (300 nmol/L), Jak3 (300 nmol/L), or drug solvent and cultured with IL-2
(200 units) or medium alone for 4 h. All experimental groups were examined
in triplicates. Cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated using a
TRIZOL and Qiagen RNeasy protocol from the Penn Microarray Facility.
RNA integrity and quality were assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent). The mRNA was reverse-transcribed using a poly(t)-T7 promoter
primer, amplified in a linear fashion by in vitro transcription with biotin
labeling and hybridized to the U133 Plus 2.0 array chips that contain >54,000
probe sets covering >47,000 transcripts. The chips were washed, stained,
and scanned according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Normalized
expression values were calculated using GCRMA (GeneSpring GX 7.3.1,
Agilent). Present/absent/marginal flag calls were calculated using the MAS5
algorithm (GeneChip Operating Software, Affymetrix) and all MAS5 quality
control variables were within reference ranges. Genes that appeared with a
present flag in all three samples of at least one condition in the experiment
were taken for further analysis. Principal component analysis was used to
assess variability of data. Differentially expressed genes were identified
using ANOVA. False discovery rate test correction was performed using
Benjamini-Hochberg step-up method (Partek Genomics Suite 6.2, Partek,
Inc.). For further analysis, we used gene lists that are estimated to have 1%
false positive genes ( false discovery rate, 0.01).
Western blot. The cells were washed briefly in PBS, centrifuged, and
lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
7.4), 1% NP40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA] supplemented with 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II from Sigma and protease inhibitor
cocktail from Roche, according to the manufacturer’s specifications. For
normalization of the gel loading, the protein extracts were assayed with
Lowry method (Bio-Rad Dc protein assay). Typically, 5 to 50 mg of the
protein per lane was loaded. To examine protein phosphorylation, the
membranes were incubated with the antibodies specific for Jak1 Y1022/
1023, STAT3 Y705, STAT5 Y694, Akt Thr308, ERK1/2 T202/Y204 (all from
Cell Signaling). 4G10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) mouse monoclonal
antibody was used to detect total tyrosine phosphorylation. To detect total
protein, we used anti-Jak1 (Cell Signaling), anti-Jak3 (Santa Cruz), and antiactin (Santa Cruz) antibodies. The membranes were incubated with the
appropriate secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. The blots were
developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) plus Western
blotting detection system from Amersham.
Immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer that contained
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Next, immunoprecipitation with the
Jak3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) and 20 AL protein G agarose
(Life Technologies-Bethesda Research Laboratories) was performed for 1
h at 4jC. Immunoprecipitates were washed, boiled, suspended in reducing
SDS loading buffer, separated on an 11% polyacrylamide/SDS gel, and
transferred electrophoretically to hybridization transfer membranes. The
membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBST buffer for 30 min and
incubated with relevant primary antibody overnight. Then they were
washed, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and
washed again. Blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence
reagent (Pierce).
Small interfering RNA assay. Mixture of four Jak1-specific or Jak3specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) or nonsense siRNA (all purchased
from Dharmacon) was introduced into cells at 100 nmol/L by lipofection
with the new generation Lipofectamine (DMRIE-C; Invitrogen). The
procedure was repeated after 24 h, and the cells were cultured for
additional 24 h. The cells were harvested at one time point 48 h after first
transfection. Cells were cultured in the presence of IL-2. Cells were
extensively washed after 48 h and placed in six-well plates for 2 h; IL-2 and

IL-21 were added for 20 min for Western blot analysis and for 24 h for the
cell proliferation and apoptosis assays.
Cell proliferation assay. After the cell culture for 24 h in presence of
IL-2, IL-15, or IL-21, cell proliferation was evaluated by detection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation using the commercially available
kit cell proliferation ELISA (Roche) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
In brief, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Corning) at concentration of
1  104 cells per well in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
labeled with BrdUrd (Roche) for 4 h. After the plate centrifugation (10 min
at 300  g ), supernatant removal, and plate drying, the cells were fixed
and the DNA was denaturated by addition of 200 mL FixDenat reagent.
The amount of incorporated BrdUrd was determined by incubation with a
specific antibody conjugated with peroxidase followed by colorimetric
conversion of the substrate and absorbance evaluation in the ELISA plate
reader.
Cell apoptosis (TUNEL) assay. We used the ApoAlert DNA fragmentation assay kit from BD Bioscience according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. In brief, cells were cultured at 0.5  106 cells/mL for 24 h with IL-2
or IL-21. The cells were collected, washed twice in PBS, and fixed with 1%
formaldehyde/PBS. After the wash, cells were permeabilized with 70% icecold ethanol for at least 2 h, washed, and incubated in TdT incubation
buffer for 1 h at 37jC. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 mmol/L
EDTA, and the cells were washed twice in 0.1% Triton X-100/bovine serum
albumin/PBS. Finally, samples were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PI/RNase/
PBS, collected and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSort BD) using the
CellQuest PRO software.

Results
Gene expression profiling of cultured CTCL in response to
stimulation by IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21. To determine expression of
which gene is modulated in CTCL cells by the key gc-signaling

cytokines, we performed whole-genome gene expression analysis in
the CTCL-derived, IL-2–dependent Sez-4 cell line after IL-2
withdrawal and subsequent stimulation with IL-2, IL-15, IL-21, or
medium alone. As shown in Fig. 1A, IL-2 and IL-15, which act via
receptors that share the entire gc/h chain signal transducing
complex, were potent modulators of gene expression in these
cultured CTCL cells. In contrast, IL-21 that uses a heterodimeric
receptor composed of the gc and IL-21–specific a chain showed a
very limited stimulatory capacity. Similar results were obtained in
separate experiments, as well as with another CTCL-derived cell
line SeAx (data not presented). The correlative intensity plot
analysis of the results (Fig. 1B) showed that the overall gene
expression patterns induced by IL-2 and IL-15 were indistinguishable from each other but markedly differed from the expression
patterns seen in the IL-21–stimulated and medium-stimulated
cells. In turn, direct comparison of the IL-21–treated and mediumtreated cells revealed great similarity in the gene expression
patterns between these two groups. IL-21–induced cells were,
however, less different from the IL-2–induced and IL-15–induced
cells than the medium-treated cells, indicating that IL-21 affects
expression of a subset of genes modulated by the other two gcsignaling cytokines. Applying filter thresholds of at least 2-fold
change in gene expression and a false discovery rate of 0.01, >1,000
gene transcripts were identified as modulated by both IL-2 and IL15 with >700 being up-regulated and >300 being down-regulated. In
striking contrast, IL-21 modulated expression of <40 gene transcripts, all of which were up-regulated. The entire microarray data
set is available in GEO database under the accession number
GSE8685.

IL-15 (20 ng/mL), or IL-21 (100 ng/mL) for 20 min. The cell lysates were either directly analyzed by Western blotting with phosphorylated specific antibodies against the
depicted tyrosine or threonine moieties of the listed proteins and control total actin-specific antibody or (A, bottom ) immunoprecipitated with an anti-Jak3 antibody

By mining KEGG and Gene Ontology databases using the
Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery
tool (12), we assigned some of the IL-2/IL-15–modulated genes into
signaling and metabolic pathways, as well as functional groups
(Table 1). The most prominent group represented the cytokine/
cytokine receptor genes, suggesting that IL-2 and IL-15 strongly
affect the ability of the cells to respond to the other cytokines.
Many of the currently classifiable genes represented the known
targets of the Jak/STAT and mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling pathways, confirming the role of IL-2 and IL-15
as potent inducers of these pathways (1). The cytokines also
exerted an effect on genes involved in purine and pyrimidine
metabolism, suggesting the presence of a proproliferative signal
induced by IL-2 and IL-15. Accordingly, many of the modulated
genes were assigned to cell proliferation and cell cycle progression
programs. In addition, a set of the modulated genes grouped within
the apoptotic cell death program suggested the capacity of IL-2 and
IL-15 to protect cell viability. Due to their very low number,
categorization of the IL-21–modulated genes was much more
difficult. However, several (CD25, Pim-1, Pim-2, BATF, STAT3, IL-5)
could be identified as targets of STAT3 (8, 13–15) and, with
exception of IL-5, assigned to the cell apoptosis program (16–20).
Impact of IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21 on activation of Jak/STAT,
PI3K/Akt, and MEK/ERK signaling pathways and cellular
growth and survival. To examine directly the effects of the gcsignaling cytokines on cell signal transduction pathways in the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

malignant T cells, we determined, in the two CTCL-derived, IL-2–
dependent cell lines Sez-4 and SeAx, the activation status of key
pathways upon cell stimulation with IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21 (Fig. 2A).
Similar to the gene expression data, there were profound differences between IL-2 and IL-15 compared with IL-21 in activation of
the Jak/STAT, PI3K/Akt, and MEK/ERK pathways. Whereas IL-2
and IL-15 induced strong phosphorylation of STAT5, Akt, and
ERK1/2 and very weak phosphorylation of STAT3, IL-21 strongly
phosphorylated STAT3 but not STAT5, Akt, or ERK1/2. As
expected, the cytokines phosphorylated Jak1 and Jak3, although
to a different degree. To show that a similar pattern of differential
activation of signaling pathways is induced by the gc-signaling
cytokines also in the uncultured, freshly isolated CTCL cells, we
examined circulating malignant cells from four patients with the
leukemic phase of the lymphoma (Fig. 2B). As with the CTCLderived cell lines, the primary malignant cells displayed strong
phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to IL-21 and strong
phosphorylation of STAT5 upon stimulation with IL-2 or IL-15.
Interestingly, essentially no phosphorylation of either Akt or
ERK1/2 in response to any of the cytokines could be detected.
These findings raised at least two interesting questions. First,
whether the differential pathway activation by IL-2 and IL-21 is the
distinct feature of CTCL cells or can be seen in CD4+ T cells in
general. Second, what is the possible cause of the difference in the
PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathway activation between the CTCLderived cell lines and primary CTCL cells. To answer the former

Effects of IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21 on CD4+ CTCL

question, we examined CD4+ T cells isolated from a healthy
individual. As shown in Fig. 2C, the pathway activation pattern was
the same as that of the native CTCL cells with IL-21 inducing
strong phosphorylation of STAT3 and IL-2 and IL-15 stimulating
strongly STAT5. This observation indicates that the differential
response to the cytokines is an intrinsic feature of CD4+ T cells
rather than a unique property of the malignant CTCL cells. In
regard to the differential activation of the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK
pathways by the primary and cultured CTCL cells, we reasoned
that this might reflect a difference in the cell activation status with
the circulating leukemic cells being in the more quiescent state. To
address this possibility, we preactivated the leukemic CTCL cells
with a mitogen (PHA) for 7days. As shown in Fig. 2D, the
preactivation with PHA changed the cytokine response pattern of
the leukemic CTCL cells. Similar to the CTCL-derived cell lines
and in contrast to the freshly isolated cells, the primed cells
phosphorylated both Akt and ERK1/2 in response to IL-2 and
IL-15 but not to IL-21.
To determine the biological effects of IL-2 and IL-21 on the CTCL
cells, we examined their influence on cell growth and survival.
Whereas IL-2 strongly stimulated proliferation of both cultured
(Fig. 3A) and primary (Fig. 3B) CTCL cells, IL-21 had very limited to
absent effect on their proliferation. In contrast, both cytokines

displayed similar degree of antiapoptotic activity in these cells
(Fig. 3C and D).
Role of Jak1 and Jak3 kinases in IL-2–mediated and IL-21–
mediated cell activation. We next examined the role of Jak1 and
Jak3 in response to the gc-signaling cytokines of the CTCL cells by
taking advantage of the availability of highly potent and specific Jak
inhibitors. Whereas the kinases, in particular Jak3, play a critical
role in the function of normal T lymphocytes, their relative
importance in malignant T cells remains poorly characterized (8,
21, 22). Initially, we performed gene expression analysis in the Sez-4
cells stimulated with IL-2 in the presence of pan-Jak and Jak3
inhibitors. Whereas the former inhibits in vitro kinase activity of all
four members of the Jak family at low nanomolar doses (IC50
inhibition at 15 nmol/L for Jak1, 1 nmol/L for Jak2, 5 nmol/L for
Jak3, and 1 nmol/L for Tyk2; ref. 10), the latter is as potent but
much more specific for Jak3 (IC50 for Jak3 at 2 nmol/L, 20 nmol/L
for Jak2, and 100 nmol/L for Jak1; ref. 11). As schematically
depicted in the similarity matrix plot analysis (Fig. 4A), both panJak and Jak3 inhibitors very profoundly suppressed the IL-2–
mediated modulation of gene expression (see GEO database,
accession number GSE8687, for the entire data set). The overall
gene expression pattern of cells treated with IL-2 along with the
pan-Jak or Jak3 inhibitor was not only indistinguishable from each

leukemic (Sezary) CTCL cells were cultured with medium alone or stimulated with the depicted gc-signaling cytokines and examined for proliferative rate in a

Figure 4. Effects of Jak inhibitors on gene expression, signal transduction, and biological functions of cytokine-stimulated CTCL cells. A, IL-2–depleted Sez-4
cells were cultured in triplicates, pretreated for 30 min with pan-Jak (300 nmol/L) inhibitor, Jak3 inhibitor (300 nmol/L), or drug vehicle alone and stimulated by IL-2
(200 units) added for 4 h to all but the control cultures. After cell harvest and total RNA isolation, all samples were checked for the RNA quality, converted to
cDNA amplified and labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2 arrays. The results are depicted as intensity plot of the gene expression data correlation.
The color scale represents the range of the pair-wise correlations among the samples. B-D, IL-2–starved Sez-4 and mitogen-primed leukemic CTCL cells were cultured

other but also from the control, IL-2 untreated cells. From >1,000
gene transcripts modulated by IL-2, there were only 35 and 14
different transcripts for pan-Jak and Jak3 inhibitor, respectively,
expression of which differed by >2.0-fold from the control, mediumtreated cells. However, for most of these relatively few genes, there
was a profound decrease in expression compared with the IL-2
only–treated cells, e.g., expression of IL-2Ra gene dropped from
>17-fold above the background to <4-fold and expression of CISH
from >26-fold to around 3-fold upon cell treatment with either of
the Jak inhibitors. This substantial decrease suggests an incompleteness of Jak inhibition rather than the presence of Jakindependent signaling involved in modulation of these genes.
Regardless, the observed profound suppression of the IL-2–
modulated genes indicates that Jak kinases or at least Jak3 is
critical for the IL-2–induced changes in gene expression in the
CTCL cells.

To characterize in greater detail the role of Jaks in the gctransduced signaling in CTCL cells, we examined the effect of the
Jak inhibitors used at various concentrations on activation of
STATs and ERK and modulation of cell functions in response to
IL-2 and IL-21. When applied at 300 nmol/L, both pan-Jak and
Jak3 inhibitors profoundly suppressed in the Sez-4 cells the IL-21–
induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 4B, top). The same inhibitor concentrations abrogated the IL-2–induced phosphorylation of
STAT5 and ERK1/2. Similar results were obtained with the primary
mitogen-preactivated CTCL cells (Fig. 4B, bottom). On the cell
function level, the inhibitors displayed similarly profound suppression of the IL-2–induced cell proliferation (Fig. 4C) and of the IL-2–
mediated or IL-21–mediated protection from apoptosis (Fig. 4D).
To determine the role of Jak1 in the gc-transduced signaling and
to confirm the key role of the Jaks by a different experimental
approach, we treated Sez-4 cells with Jak1 and Jak3 siRNA. As

shown in Fig. 5A, depletion of either of the kinases markedly
inhibited IL-2–induced phosphorylation of STAT5 and ERK1/2 and
the IL-21–induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Loss of Jak1 and Jak3
expression also affected to a similar degree the IL-2–induced cell
proliferation (Fig. 5B), as well as the IL-2–promoted and IL-21–
promoted cell survival (Fig. 5C). These observations show that both
Jak1 and Jak3 play a critical role in IL-2–induced and IL-21–
induced cell signaling in CTCL cells.

Discussion
In this study, we have characterized the effect on the CTCL cell
lines and primary leukemic (Sezary) cells of three key cytokines
that signal through receptors containing the gc chain and are
critical for development and function of various normal immune
cells. We have found that IL-2 and IL-15 markedly changed
expression by of >1,000 gene transcripts (with over 700 being upregulated and over 300 being down-regulated) in a CTCL-derived
cell line. In contrast, IL-21 increased expression of <40 genes.
Proteins encoded by some of the IL-2/IL-15–regulated genes
belonged to the Jak/STAT and MAPK signaling pathways, and many
were classifiable as the pathway-induced members of the cell
proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis functional programs. At least
five of the IL-21–modulated genes represented known targets of
STAT3, and their protein products are known to protect cells from
apoptosis. Whereas all three cytokines induced Jak1 and Jak3
phosphorylation, IL-2 and IL-15 induced strong STAT5 but not
STAT3 phosphorylation. In contrast, IL-21 had the opposite effect
on STAT3 and STAT5. Furthermore, IL-2 and IL-15, but not IL-21,
activated PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways as determined by Akt
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Similar observations were made in

the primary CTCL cells derived directly from patients with the
leukemic form of the lymphoma (Sezary syndrome) with the caveat
that the leukemic primary cells required mitogen-induced priming
to activate the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways. As expected, IL2 and IL-15 induced proliferation of both cultured and native CTCL
cells and protected them from the apoptotic cell death (23),
whereas IL-21 had essentially no proproliferative effect but
protected the cells from apoptosis. The CTCL cell signaling in
response to the cytokines was entirely Jak1 and Jak3 kinase
dependent because high-specificity pan-Jak and Jak3 inhibitors
abrogated the IL-2–induced gene expression modulation, as well as
the IL-2–triggered and IL-21–triggered signal transduction by not
only the Jak/STAT but also, in the case of the IL-2, MEK/ERK
pathway. Jak inhibitors suppressed also the IL-2–promoted and IL21–promoted cell proliferation and protection from cell apoptosis.
Jak1 and Jak3 siRNA-mediated depletion inhibited all the examined
signaling pathways, as well as cell growth and survival.
Although there are some biological differences in the function of
IL-2 and IL-15 (1, 2), it is not particularly surprising that IL-2 and
IL-15 modulated in the CTCL cells essentially overlapping sets of
genes and activated the same signaling pathways, given that their
receptors share the entire signal transduction complex of the h and
gc chains. A similar overlap in the gene expression pattern (24) and
signaling pathway activation (2, 25, 26) was found also in normal
murine CD8+ T cells stimulated with these cytokines. Both
cytokines are also highly mitogenic for these cells (2, 26) and
CTCL cells (23). The detailed study of the biochemical mechanisms
underlying the noted differences of IL-2 and IL-15 effects on
murine CD8+ T cells has found that the differences affect protein
synthesis, are quantitative rather than qualitative in nature, and
tend to occur upon prolonged cell stimulation likely due to the

transduction and biological functions of cytokine-stimulated
CTCL cell line. Sez-4 cells were pretreated at 0 and 24 h
with 100 nmol/L of nonsense (control) or Jak1-specific or
Jak3-specific siRNA mixes and cultured in the presence of
IL-2 for additional 24 h and in its absence for additional
2 h. A, the cell lysates obtained after 20 min of stimulation
with IL-2 or IL-21 were analyzed by Western blotting with
the listed control and phosphorylated specific antibodies.
Proliferative (B ) and apoptotic (C ) cell rates were determined
after 6 and 24 h of the cytokine stimulation, respectively.

differential ability of these cytokines to regulate sustained
expression of their respective IL-2–specific and IL-15–specific achain receptor subunits (2).
It is remarkable that, in contrast to STAT5 activation, the
primary leukemic CTCL cells required transient preactivation to
efficiently activate the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways in
response to IL-2. This observation is very reminiscent of the
finding that normal murine CD4+CD25+ T cells also required
priming to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway upon IL-2 stimulation
(27). These combined observations indicate that the final effect of
IL-2 and likely other cytokines and cellular stimuli are dependent
on the discrete functional status of the targeted cells.
The profound difference in the effect on the CTCL cells of IL-21
compared with IL-2 and IL-15 was quite surprising considering
that not only their respective receptors share the gc chain but
also that IL-21 receptor’s a chain displays a high degree of
homology to the IL-2 and IL-15 receptor’s h chain. Consequently,
both types of receptors have very similar signaling units and
activate the same members of the Jak kinase family Jak1 and Jak3.
The weak response to IL-21 seems, however, strictly cell type–
specific because in naive murine CD8+ T cells, IL-21 activated at
least as many genes as IL-15 (5). Although, similar to our findings,
IL-21 induced strong phosphorylation of STAT3 in the murine
CD8+ T cells, it also induced somewhat weaker phosphorylation
of STAT5, STAT1, Src homology and collagen, and Akt (26).
Finally, IL-21 promoted functional maturation and proliferation of
the cells (5, 26).
Despite the overall very limited effect of IL-21 on the CTCL cells,
our data show that the cytokine is active in such cells given its
effect on gene expression, cell signaling, and protection from
apoptotic cell death. The results also indicate that STAT3 is the key
effector protein of the IL-21–induced signaling in the CTCL cells. In
addition to STAT3 being strongly and selectively phosphorylated,
the ‘‘gene expression signature’’ of STAT3 was the only one we
could discern within the set of genes regulated by IL-21 as
presented in the Results. Furthermore, many of the STAT3
signature genes have well-documented antiapoptotic effect
(16–20). Our recent observation that siRNA-mediated STAT3
depletion performed in the CTCL cells that display persistent
activation of the factor triggered massive apoptotic cell death (28)
strongly supports this notion.

Our findings that IL-2 and IL-15 are highly stimulatory for CTCL
cells and that IL-21 is not may have important translational
implications for CTCL and, possibly, other CD4+ T cell–derived
lymphomas. Namely, they provide rationale for targeting the Jak1/
Jak3 complex associated with the gc-containing cytokine receptors,
on one hand, and for applying IL-21 as a booster of the immune
response, on the other hand. As we show, the small molecule
inhibitors that target either the entire Jak family (10) or highly
selectively Jak3 (11) profoundly inhibit gene expression, cell
signaling, and function of CTCL cells. The fact that the Jak3
inhibitor was at least as effective as the pan-Jak inhibitor indicates
that targeted inactivation of Jak3 is sufficient to suppress in CTCL
cells signals generated by the IL-2 type, gc-signaling cytokines.
Given the high specificity of the Jak3 inhibitor, originally developed
as an immunosuppressive agent to prevent transplant rejection
(11, 29), and the highly restricted expression of the gc to immune
cells, targeting Jak3 therapeutically in CTCL possibly, other CD4+
T-cell lymphomas might prove particularly effective and relatively
devoid of side effects. In regard to IL-21, its very limited effect on
the CTCL cell gene expression, cell signaling, and proliferation
coupled with the highly stimulatory effect of the cytokine on
normal immune CD8+ T cells (5, 26, 30) and NK cells (31) strongly
suggest that IL-21 may prove highly efficacious in therapy of this
type of T-cell lymphoma despite the noted antiapoptotic effect on
the CTCL cells (Fig. 3). The IL-21–promoted long-term survival of
mice bearing various tumors including a wide spread, systemic
lymphoma (30–36) strongly supports this notion. Finally, it is also
conceivable that the appropriately timed application of the Jak3
inhibitor to suppress growth and survival of the CTCL cells
alternated with IL-21 administration to boost the antilymphoma
immune response may display a particularly beneficial therapeutic
effect in CTCL and similar T-cell lymphomas.
