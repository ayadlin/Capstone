Cancer chemoprevention uses natural, synthetic, or biological substances to reverse,
suppress, or prevent either the initial phase of carcinogenesis or the progression of
neoplastic cells to cancer1. It holds promise for overcoming problems associated with the
treatment of late-stage cancers. However, the broad application of chemoprevention is
compromised currently by limited effectiveness and potential toxicity. In an effort to
overcome these challenges, we developed a new chemoprevention approach that specifically
targets premalignant tumor cells for apoptosis. This procedure is based on our finding that a
deficiency in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and subsequent activation of βcatenin lead to the repression of cellular caspase-8 inhibitor cFLIP expression through
activation of c-Myc and that 9-cis-retinyl acetate (RAc) independently upregulates tumor
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) death receptors and suppresses
decoy receptors. Thus, the combination of TRAIL and RAc induces apoptosis in APCdeficient premalignant cells without affecting normal cells in vitro. In addition, we show that
short-term and non-continuous TRAIL and RAc treatment induces apoptosis specifically in
intestinal polyps, strongly inhibits tumor growth, and prolongs survival in multiple intestinal
neoplasms C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J (ApcMin) mice. With our approach, we further demonstrate
that TRAIL and RAc induce significant cell death in human colon polyps, providing a
potentially selective approach for colorectal cancer chemoprevention by targeting APCdeficient cells for apoptosis.
TRAIL, or Apo2L, is a membrane-bound TNF family ligand2,3. While TRAIL induces
apoptosis in cancer cells, it does not harm normal cells4,5. To test the response of
premalignant tumor cells to TRAIL, we isolated primary adenoma cells from intestinal
polyps (benign adenomas) of ApcMin mice6-8. We also isolated intestinal epithelial cells
from wild-type mice as controls (Supplementary Fig. 1a). TRAIL treatment did not induce
any apoptosis in the isolated epithelial cells (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Previous

reports indicate that certain retinoids synergize TRAIL-induced apoptosis in some cancer
cell lines by inducing either TRAIL or its death receptors 9-11. We explored the effect of
RAc on TRAIL sensitivity in isolated primary adenoma and normal epithelial cells.
Although RAc alone had no effect on the survival of either normal cells from control mice
or adenoma cells, it specifically sensitized the adenoma cells to TRAIL-induced cell death
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1b). These results show that RAc and TRAIL
synergistically induce apoptosis in intestinal adenoma cells derived from ApcMin mice.
The major difference between adenoma cells and normal cells is the loss of the wild-type
APC allele in adenoma cells12. To test the role of APC in cell sensitivity to TRAIL and
RAc, we knocked down APC expression in an immortalized normal human colon epithelial
cell line, NCM356, using APC small interfering RNA (APC-siRNA) (Fig. 1b). We observed
that knockdown of APC and treatment with TRAIL and RAc resulted in caspase 8 cleavage
and an increase in caspase 3/7 activity (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1c). Furthermore,
caspase 8 inhibitor Z-IETD blocked caspase 3/7 activity (Supplementary Fig. 1c),
suggesting that caspase 8 processing resulted in its activation. Similar results were obtained
using an immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B-BW1799 or
BW1799) (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that APC deficiency is the key
factor in sensitizing normal cells to apoptosis induced by the combination of TRAIL and
RAc.

Inactivation of APC leads to stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin and
transcriptional activation of target genes, such as c-Myc and cyclin D113. To investigate the
signaling events in the APC pathway required for sensitizing cells to TRAIL and RAc, we
transfected either stabilized β-catenin14 or full-length c-Myc into NCM356 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 3a and b). Expression of either β-catenin mutant or c-Myc led to
TRAIL- and RAc-mediated caspase 8 cleavage and activation (Fig. 2a and Supplementary
Fig. 3c). Transfection of cyclin D1 had no effect on TRAIL- and RAc-induced apoptosis in
NCM356 and other cells (data not shown). We then determined the requirement of c-Myc
for sensitizing cells to TRAIL and RAc. Knockdown of APC led to an increase in c-Myc
expression, as expected. Co-transfection of c-Myc-siRNA blocked APC deficiencymediated c-Myc induction and caspase 8 cleavage/activation in response to TRAIL and RAc
(Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3c). We further confirmed these observations using
independent siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results indicate that the effect of APC
on cell response to TRAIL and RAc is largely dependent on APC/β-catenin-mediated
activation of c-Myc.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Other studies have shown that c-Myc directly suppresses expression of cFLIP and that this
activity correlates with TRAIL sensitivity15. NCM356 cells expressed readily detectable
cFLIP and transfection of c-Myc resulted in a significant decrease in cFLIP expression and
caspase 8 cleavage (Fig. 2c). While direct suppression of cFLIP expression by cFLIP-siRNA
led to caspase 8 cleavage and activation in NCM356 cells treated with TRAIL and RAc,
rescue of cFLIP expression by transfection of a cFLIP expression plasmid prevented c-Mycinduced caspase 8 processing and activation in response to TRAIL and RAc (Fig. 2c and
Supplementary Fig. 3c). Similar results were obtained in BW1799 cells (Supplementary Fig.
5). In addition to suppressing cFLIP expression, c-Myc could also act on mitochondria to
facilitate TRAIL-induced apoptosis16. To test this possibility, we performed rescue
experiments using Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Overexpression of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL did not
inhibit c-Myc-mediated caspase 8 processing and activation in response to TRAIL and RAc
(Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3c). These results indicate that APC deficiency sensitizes
normal cells to TRAIL and RAc by suppressing cFLIP expression through the activation of
β-catenin and c-Myc.

Previous reports have shown that certain retinoids sensitize some cancer cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis by upregulating either TRAIL or TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 9,10. To
test the effect of RAc on normal cells in our setting, we examined the expression of TRAIL
receptors in NCM356, BW1779, and another immortalized normal human colon epithelial
cell line CRL1831 cells after RAc treatment. Although RAc did not induce TRAIL
expression (data not shown), it induced DR4 or DR5 expression in these cells (Fig. 2d and
Supplementary Fig. 6a). Interestingly, RAc strongly suppressed DcR1 expression in these
cells (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 6a). In addition, the DcR2 expression was inhibited by
RAc in NCM356 cells (Fig. 2d). We further showed that RAc caused similar changes in
mRNA levels in NCM356 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6b), suggesting that RAc modulates
TRAIL receptor expression at the levels of mRNA.
Overexpression of DR5 sensitized APC-knockdown cells to TRAIL-induced caspase 8
cleavage and activation (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 6c). Pretreatment of APCknockdown cells with a DcR1-neutralizing antibody to block TRAIL-DcR1 interaction also
partially induced caspase 8 cleavage and activation after TRAIL treatment, and this effect
was further enhanced in DR5-transfected cells (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 6c). Similar
results were obtained in BW1799 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d and e). These data suggest
that both induction of DR5 and suppression of DcR1 contribute to the effect of RAc in
sensitizing APC-deficient cells to apoptosis.

We next tested the effect of TRAIL and RAc in ApcMin mice in vivo. We first treated the 3month-old ApcMin mice with TRAIL and low-dose RAc for 15 treatment cycles over six
weeks. We observed that TRAIL and RAc significantly inhibited the growth of intestinal
polyps as compared to controls (Fig. 3a). Histological analysis of tumors and adjacent
normal tissues in treated mice showed that many cells in tumors, but not in normal tissues,
contain condensed nuclei, suggesting that cells in the tumors are dying (Fig. 3b). This
observation was confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) analysis (Fig. 3b). When the total numbers and sizes of the polyps were
compared 1 month after the six week treatment period, the treated mice displayed an average
4- to 5-fold decrease in the total number of polyps relative to the mice treated with PBS
control (Fig. 3c). The reduction in large polyps (≥2 mm) was much more pronounced (to
about 1/30 of control) (Fig. 3c). These data demonstrate that the combination of TRAIL and
RAc induces apoptosis specifically in Apc-defective polyps and effectively suppresses the
tumor growth.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Biochemically, accumulation of soluble β-catenin and induction of c-Myc expression were
seen in the polyps of ApcMin mice but not in normal tissue (Supplementary Fig. 7a). cFLIP
protein was readily detectable in normal tissue, while it was significantly reduced in polyps
(Supplementary Fig. 7b). Consistent with our in vitro observations, RAc induced DR5
expression and repressed DcR1 in both the polyps in ApcMin mice.
Since TRAIL and RAc together target APC-deficient cells for apoptosis, this combination
has the potential to achieve chemoprevention in short-term therapy. To test this, we applied
two short consecutive TRAIL and RAc treatment cycles to ApcMin within a week and
analyzed the intestinal tumors 2 weeks after treatment. After only two treatments, we
observed a 69% reduction in the number of polyps when 3 mg/kg of TRAIL and 68 μg/kg of
RAc were injected into ApcMin mice (Fig. 3d). The tumor numbers were further reduced to
10% of the control when 10-fold higher doses of TRAIL and RAc were used (Fig. 3d).
These data indicate that short-term treatment with TRAIL and RAc is capable for inhibiting
growth of premalignant cells in ApcMin mice. To test the effect of TRAIL and RAc
treatment on the survival of ApcMin mice, we applied 5 non-consecutive TRAIL and RAc
treatments to ApcMin mice within 4 months (average 1 treatment every 3 weeks). All mice in

the control group treated with PBS died within 7 months; however, five of the seven treated
mice survived beyond 8 months (P≤0.001) (Fig. 3e) demonstrating that non-continuous
TRAIL and RAc treatment yields a long-term survival benefit for ApcMin mice. While it is
likely that the two early deaths in the treatment group resulted from a late start in treatment,
it cannot be ruled out that intrinsic resistance, heterogeneity, genetic or epi-genetic changes
of premalignant cells can influence the effect of TRAIL treatment. Further study will
provide a more in-depth assessment.

As a first step to demonstrate the efficacy and relevance of TRAIL and RAc treatment in
humans, we treated biopsy samples of both normal and tumor regions from consenting
familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients under organ culture conditions as
reported 17,18. A cross section of normal colon tissue showed a round and defined structure
of individual villus consisting of a monolayer of colon epithelial cells and membrane βcatenin staining pattern, while dysplastic colon polyps showed much larger villi, bigger
nuclei, an irregular structure consisting of multiple epithelial layers, and enhanced nuclear
β-catenin staining (Fig. 4a). Treatment of normal tissue slices with TRAIL and RAc did not
induce significant cell death, while the same treatment in the polyp samples resulted in
significant cell death, as detected by TUNEL assay (Fig. 4a). Quantification of TUNELpositive cells showed that TRAIL and RAc killed an average of 57% of the cells in the
human colon polyps (Fig. 4b). These results verify that TRAIL and RAc are effective
against human polyps from FAP patients in vitro and that our approach holds promise for
the chemoprevention of colon cancer in humans.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A major concern in chemoprevention is potential toxicity associated with treatment. We
have shown that TRAIL and RAc target the APC-β-catenin-c-Myc signaling pathway for
apoptosis. Since activation of β-catenin is involved in stem cell self-renewal and
maintenance in adult tissues19, TRAIL and RAc could possibly interact in a detrimental way
with stem cells. In order to investigate this, we first tested the effect of TRAIL and RAc on
intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in ApcMin mice. Using a putative ISC marker leucine-richrepeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor (Lgr5)20, we noted that most of the Lgr5
positive cells in the normal sections were located at the bottom of the crypt as reported20
(Fig. 4c). Staining of active caspase 3 revealed extensive staining in tumor sections similar
to the findings shown in Figure 3b (Fig. 4c). More importantly, no staining was detected in
serial sections from the normal region, including Lgr5+ cells in the crypt regions where the
ISC resides (Fig. 4c). We also studied the effect of long-term TRAIL and RAc treatment on
tissue-resident stem cells isolated from pararenal adipose tissue (mASCs) of ApcMin mice21
(Supplementary Fig. 8). We found no detectable effect on morphology (data not shown),
neural differentiation (data not shown), proliferation and apoptosis, senescence,
osteogenesis, and adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo (Supplementary Fig 9 and 10).
Taken together, these results suggest that TRAIL and RAc exert no negative effect on stem
cells (ISCs and mASCs) in mice.
In summary, we discovered a synergistic interaction among TRAIL, RAc, and tumor
suppressor APC, which results in the specific induction of apoptosis in APC-deficient cells
by TRAIL and RAc (Supplementary Fig. 11). Induction of apoptosis represents a most
potent cellular mechanism against cancer, and selectively eliminating premalignant tumor
cells by TRAIL and RAc is an effective method of chemoprevention. More importantly, we
demonstrate that the chemopreventive effect of TRAIL and RAc can be achieved by shortterm intermittent and non-continuous treatment cycles. Thereby, the potential side effects
and costs often associated with long-term treatment could be minimized and controlled.

Methods Summary
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recombinant soluble human TRAIL was prepared according to a published method22. For
TRAIL and RAc treatment, the cells were first treated with RAc (6.8 ng/ml) for 48 h, and
then TRAIL (50ng/ml or 500ng/ml) was added. Cell viability was determined using Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Sigma). Caspase 3/7 activity was measured using ApoONE Homogeneous Caspase 3/7 assay kit (Promega). Transfection and Western blotting
were performed as described previously23. The apoptotic cells in tumor samples were
detected by TUNEL assay using an apoptosis detection kit (R&D Systems) or caspase 3
staining using an anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody (Cell Signaling). ApcMin mice were
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. For treatment, ApcMin mice at 3 months of age
were first given RAc via i.p. injection at 68 μg/kg. After 48 h, TRAIL was injected i.p. at 3
mg/kg. After 24 h, RAc was injected again, followed by TRAIL injection. The procedure
was repeated for 6 weeks resulting in a total of 15 treatment cycles. Whole intestines were
collected immediately after euthanasia and opened longitudinally so that polyps could be
counted and measured. Tissues were processed by either formalin fixation or by being
frozen in liquid nitrogen for tissue protein extraction, H&E staining, immunohistochemical
analysis, and TUNEL assay. All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center. Fresh human tissue samples were obtained from consenting FAP patients
according to an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol.

Primary mouse intestinal epithelial cells and adenoma cells were isolated from either normal
C57/B6 mice or ApcMin mice as reported24. Briefly, the small intestine or polyps were cut
into 2- to 3-mm segments. The tissues were transferred to a 15-ml tube, washed at least 10
times in 10 ml of fresh Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) with vigorous shaking, and
diced into <1-mm3 pieces using a sharp scalpel blade. The tissue pieces were transferred to a
15-ml tube with 10 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 100 U/ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The mixtures were allowed to settle under gravity
for 1 min and all but a small amount at the bottom was carefully removed. This procedure
was repeated 5 times. The mixtures were then washed with DMEM 3 times and the pellet
was resuspended in the epithelial cell medium containing equal volumes of DMEM and
Ham's F-12 medium with the following additives: 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml epidermal
growth factor, 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 2 mM
glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.2% D-glucose, and 2% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). CRL1831 cells were obtained from ATCC. NCM356 cells were
obtained from INCELL (San Antonio, TX) and grown in A52 medium supplemented with
30 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 8 μg/ml vitamin C, 2 mM glutamine and 1 nM

Plasmids and vector-based siRNA construction
The c-Myc, β-catenin, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL expression plasmids were described
previously14,23,25. DR5 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Wafik El-Deiry of
the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The full-length cFLIP cDNA was
generated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of total RNA from HeLa cells.
All siRNAs except APC-siRNA(2) and c-Myc-siRNA(2) were generated in pSUPER as
described elsewhere23. The target sequence of human APC is 5′-ggaagtattgaagatgaag-3′, of
human cFLIP 5′-agaggtaagctgtctgtcg-3′, and of human c-Myc 5′-ttcaagaga-3′. The APCsiRNA(2) and c-Myc-siRNA(2) were purchased from Open Biosystems with target
sequences of 5′-gctgtgaaattcacagtaata-3′ and 5′-ccgagaacagttgaaacacaaa-3′, respectively.
Quantitative PCR

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Invitrogen). The cDNA was prepared using SuperScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen).
Quantitative PCR was performed using the SYBR Green Quantitative PCR kit from Thermo
Scientific in a Bio-Rad C1000TM Thermal Cycler following the manufacturer's protocol.
Amplification was carried out in a total volume of 20 μL for 40 cycles of 15 seconds at
95°C, 20 seconds at 60°C, and 30 seconds at 72°C. Samples were run in triplicate and their
relative expression was determined by normalizing expression of each target GAPDH.
These were then compared with the normalized expression in Control untreated sample to
calculate a fold change value. Primer sequences were as follows: human GAPDH 5'TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3' and 5'-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3'; human
DR4 5'-TGTACGCCCTGGAGTGACAT-3' and 5'-CACCAACAGCAACGGAACAA-3';

Paired tumor and adjacent normal samples from consenting patients (male and female)
undergoing colonoscopy at the MD Anderson Cancer Center Gastrointestinal Oncology and
Digestive Diseases endoscopy and surgical unit were collected, transferred to research lab in
cold media, and processed within 1 h in a sterile tissue culture hood. The culture condition is
modified based on previous reports17,18. Briefly, the culture medium consists of a 1:1
mixture Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium and Ham's F12 with 5% fetal calf serum
(FCS), 10mM HEPES, 0.5% DMSO, 0.5ug/ml Hydrocortisone, 1% MEM vitamins solution,
5μg/ml insulin, 5μg/ml transferin, 5ng/ml selenium, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml
streptomycin, 15 μg/ml gentamicin and 15 μg/ml Ciproxin. The tissue is washed five times
in culture media. The tissue is placed in a sterile glass dish where all necrotic and visible
connective tissue is removed. The tissue is sliced gently into very thin pieces using a blade
and placed in a 6-well tissue culture dish with one ml of growth media. The dish is placed in
a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h. It is inspected visually for contamination and the media
is pulled off and replaced after every 2 days. After 1 day in culture, the tissue slices were
subject to various treatment protocols.

Isolation and culture of adipose tissue-derived stem cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from three mice (one wild-type and two ApcMin)
or ApcMin mice that had received 5 cycles of TRAIL and RAc treatment within 4 months
following our institutional guidelines. Cells were isolated from adipose tissue as described
previously 26,27. Adipose tissue was minced and incubated for 90 min at 37°C on a shaker
with Liberase Blendzyme 3 (Roche) at a concentration of 4 U/g fat tissue in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). The digested tissue was sequentially filtered through 100-μm and 40μm filters (Fisher Scientific) and centrifuged at 450 g for 5 min. The supernatant containing
adipocytes and debris was discarded; the pelleted cells were washed twice with HBSS
(Cellgro) and finally resuspended in stem cell growth medium (SCGM), which contained
alpha-modification of Eagle's medium (αMEM, Cellgro), 20% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), 2
mM glutamine (Cellgro), and 100 U/ml penicillin with 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Cellgro).
Cells adhering to plastic were designated mice adipose tissue-derived stem cells (mASCs)
and grown in Nunclon culture flasks (Nunc) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2, followed by daily washes to remove red blood cells and non-attached cells. After
the mASCs became confluent (passage 0), cells were digested and seeded at a density of
3,000 cells/cm2 (passage 1).
Assays of mASCs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For in vitro treatment assays, mASCs were cultured in the presence TRAIL (50ng/ml), or
RAc (6.8 ng/ml), or both for two months (about 60 doublings). For effect of TRAIL and
RAc treatment in vivo, mASCs were harvested from ApcMin mice that had received 5 cycles
of treatments with TRAIL (3 mg/kg) and RAc (68 μg/kg) in 4 months. Cell proliferation
was determined by counting live cells. Apoptosis was measured using Annexin V staining
(BD Biosciences) using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and Cell Quest
software (Becton Dickinson). Cell senescence was determined by β-galactosidase activity at
pH 6 using the Senescent Cells Staining Kit (Cell Signaling) according to the provided
protocol. Osteogenic differentiation of mASCs was induced in osteogenic medium
containing high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1 μM dexamethasone, 200
μM L-ascorbic acid, and 10 mM β-glycerol phosphate (Sigma). The medium was changed
every 3 days for 2 weeks. In the control experiment, mASCs were cultured in control
medium containing high-glucose DMEM plus 10% FBS for 2 weeks. To assess
mineralization, calcium deposits in cultures were stained with Alizarin Red S (Sigma). The
osteogenic efficiency was then determined using Osteogenesis Quantitation Kit (Chemicon)
following the manufacture's instructions. The adipogenic ability of mASCs was induced in
adipogenic medium for up to 2 weeks as described previously26,27. The adipogenic medium
contained low-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml
penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Cellgro), 100 μM L-ascorbic acid, 1 μM
dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 100 μM indomethacin, and 10 μg/ml
insulin (Sigma). mASCs of the control group were cultured in low-glucose DMEM plus
10% FBS (control media). The medium was changed every 3 days. Adipogenesis of cells
was assessed by incubating cells with Oil Red O solution (Sigma) to stain neutral lipids in
the cytoplasm. The adipogenic efficiency of mASCs was then determined using
Adipogenesis Quantitation Kit (Chemicon) according to the protocol provided by the
manufacturer.
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence staining
Tissues in paraffin block were sectioned at 4-μM in thickness. After deparaffinization,
Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer (Vector lab, Burlingame, CA) heated in
a pressure cooker for 25 min and then cooled to room temperature. Blocking of endogenous
peroxides was accomplished by incubating sections in 3% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) for 5
min. Antibodies were incubated with sections overnight at 4°C. Immunostaining was

performed by using DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) or AEC (3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole)
(Dako) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin for 1 min, rinsed in water and cover slipped permanently for light microscopy.
The mASCs cultured on glass cover slips were washed 3 times with PBS and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times
with PBS alone or PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and blocked by treatment
with 10% donkey serum for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with
primary antibodies fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse CD14 and CD31 or
phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse CD44 and CD90 in a humidified chamber for 1 h at
37°C. Thereafter, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain the cell nuclei.
The images of cells were taken under a fluorescence microscope.
Statistical analysis
The two-tailed Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
compare differences between groups. Values with P<0.05 were considered statistically
significant. Survival analyses were performed using SPSS software (Version 16.0).

Figure 1. TRAIL and RAc induce apoptosis in APC-deficient cells

(a) Primary epithelial cells were isolated from normal mouse intestine and polyps from
ApcMin mice and treated with TRAIL (50 ng/ml for 24 h), RAc (6.8 ng/ml for 48 h), or both
(RAc for 48 h then TRAIL for 24 h). Cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and
propidium iodide. Early apoptotic cells (annexin V positive, PI negative) were counted. The
data represent results from three independent experiments. Average and standard deviation
are shown. (b) Immortalized normal human colon epithelial cells (NCM356) were
transfected with either nonspecific Ns-siRNA or APC-siRNA, and APC protein was
detected 48 h after transfection by Western blotting. (c) The transfected NCM356 cells were
treated and harvested, and both full-length pro-caspase 8 and cleaved forms (p44/42 and
p18) were detected by Western blotting.

Figure 2. Down regulation of cFLIP by APC/β-catenin-mediated activation of c-Myc and
modulation of TRAIL receptor expression by RAc contribute to the activation of TRAIL
signaling

(a) NCM356 cells were transfected with either β-catenin or c-Myc and treated with TRAIL,
RAc, or both. Cleavage of caspase 8 was detected by Western blotting. (b) NCM356 cells
were transfected with Ns-siRNA, APC-siRNA (GFP tagged), or APC-siRNA and c-MycsiRNA. The transfected cells were treated with RAc and TRAIL, and photographs were
taken. Expression of APC, c-Myc, and caspase 8 was detected by Western blotting. (c)
NCM356 cells were transfected with c-Myc, cFLIP-siRNA, c-Myc and cFLIP, c-Myc and
Bcl-2, or c-Myc and Bcl-XL. The transfected cells were treated with RAc and TRAIL.
Expression of c-Myc, cFLIP, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and caspase 8 was detected by Western
blotting. (d) NCM356 cells were treated with RAc for 48 h, and expression of DR4, DR5,
DcR1, and DcR2 was detected by Western blotting. (e) NCM356 cells were transfected with
either APC-siRNA or APC-siRNA and DR5 or were pretreated with an anti-DcR1 antibody
after APC-siRNA transfection. Nonspecific Ns-siRNA was used as control. Transfected
cells were treated with TRAIL alone or with TRAIL and RAc, as indicated. Cleavage of
caspase 8 was detected by Western blotting.

Figure 3. Treatment with TRAIL and RAc induces cell death in the polyps, inhibits tumor
growth, and promote survival in ApcMin mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(a) The ApcMin mice were treated with either control phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or
TRAIL and RAc for 15 treatment cycles. Intestinal polyps were examined 1 month after the
treatment and photographs were taken. (b) The polyp samples and adjacent sections were
stained by H&E and TUNEL stain. Surrounding normal tissue was used as the control.
Representative photographs are shown. (c) Intestinal polyps in the entire intestinal track
were examined and counted. Each treatment group contained 5-7 mice. Average and
standard deviations are shown. An asterisk indicates P<0.005. (d). The ApcMin mice were
treated with either 1X or 10X doses of TRAIL and RAc for two cycles within a week. The
intestinal polyps in the entire intestinal track were examined and counted. Each treatment
group contained 5-7 mice. Average and standard deviation are shown. An asterisk indicates
P<0.005. (e) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of ApcMin mice. ApcMin mice at 4 month were
treated with either TRAIL (3 mg/kg) and RAc (68 μg/kg) or control PBS every 3 weeks for
5 times. The endpoint was reached when mice were either moribund or at day 243. Mean
survival time was 212.8 ± 5.9 in TRAIL and RAc group (7 mice) and 186 ± 2.6 in the PBS
treated group (8 mice) with log-rank test p≤0.001. All statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS software (version 16.0).

Figure 4. Effect of TRAIL and RAc on human colon polyps and ISCs, and synthetic lethal
interaction of TRAIL, RAc and APC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(a) Tissue slices from both the normal region and colon polyps from FAP patients were
treated with RAc (6.8 ng/ml) for 48 h and then with TRAIL (100 ng/ml) for an additional 24
h (TRAIL+RAc). The samples treated with vehicle were used as controls (C). H&E staining,
β-catenin staining, and TUNEL assay (green) were performed. Nuclei were revealed by
DAPI staining (blue). Scale bar equals 100 μm. Representative photographs are shown. (b)
TUNEL-positive cells (green) were counted against the number of nuclei in multiple fields
under a microscope. Average and standard deviations are shown. The data are derived from
samples of 4 patients. (c) ApcMin mice were treated with 5 non-continuous cycles of TRAIL
and RAc. Both the normal tissue and polyps of the intestine were serially sectioned and
stained with either Lgr5 (brown), or activated caspase 3 (red), or both. Multiple serial
sections were analyzed and representative photographs are shown.
