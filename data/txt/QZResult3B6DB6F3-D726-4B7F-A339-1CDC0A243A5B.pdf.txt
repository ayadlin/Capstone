Abstract
Clusterin is a secretory heterodimeric glycoprotein and the overexpression
of secretory clusterin (sCLU) promotes cancer cell proliferation and reduces
chemosensitivity. Therefore, sCLU might be an effective target for anticancer
therapy. In the current study, we identified eIF3f as a novel CLU-interacting protein
and demonstrated its novel function as a CLU inhibitor. The overexpression of eIF3f
retarded cancer cell growth significantly and induced apoptosis. In addition, eIF3f
interacted with the α-chain (1–227) of sCLU. This interaction blocked modification of
psCLU, thereby decreasing the expression and secretion of α/β CLU. Consequently, the
overexpression of eIF3f suppressed Akt and ERK signaling and subsequently depleted
CLU expression. In addition, eIF3F stabilized p53, which increased the expression of
p21 and Bax. Interestingly, the expression of Bax was increased without the activation
of p53. eIF3f injected into a xenograft model of human cervical cancer in nude mice
markedly inhibited tumor growth. The identification of this novel function of eIF3f
as a sCLU inhibitor might open novel avenues for developing improved strategies for
CLU-targeted anti-cancer therapies.

Introduction

signal peptide. Therefore, α/β cleavage and glycosylation
do not occur. pnCLU is located in the cytoplasm normally;
it then undergoes glycosylation to form the 55-kDa nCLU,
which is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in
response to cell damage [6, 7].
CLU expression is a key factor in tumorigenesis
and metastasis. Elevated CLU mRNA and protein levels
have been reported in various human cancers, including
prostate [8], breast [9], bladder [10], lung [11], renal [12],
colon [13], ovarian [14], and cervical [15, 16] cancers. In
particular, compared with normal tissues, sCLU and nCLU
are overexpressed and downregulated in malignancies.
sCLU functions as a pro-survival factor, whereas nCLU
has a pro-apoptotic role [17, 18]. For example, in LNCaP
prostate cancer cells, sCLU was associated with tumor
progression, and it protected cells from the effects of
chemotherapeutic drugs [19]. In addition, the knockdown
of sCLU in osteosarcoma cells sensitized cells to
chemotherapy and oxidative stress signals [20]. Therefore,
sCLU is an attractive target for cancer treatment.
In the current study, we clarified the molecular
regulation and role of different CLU isoforms in cancer

Clusterin (CLU), also known as apolipoprotein J
(APO J), sulfated glycoprotein (SGP-2), or testosterone
repressed prostate message-2 (TRPM-2), is a glycoprotein
that acts in a variety of physiological processes such as
the cell cycle, DNA repair, tissue remodeling, membrane
recycling, lipid transport, immune system regulation, cell
adhesion, and apoptosis [1-5]. There are two isoforms of
CLU in human cells: secretory CLU (sCLU) and nuclear
CLU (nCLU). sCLU is translated into a 60-kDa sCLU
precursor protein (psCLU) from the first AUG codon. This
protein is then translocated directly into the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) by a leader signal peptide, where it is
glycosylated and cleaved into α- and β-chains in the
trans-Golgi compartments. Finally, the α- and β-chains
are held together by five disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm,
and the protein is then secreted from the cell [1, 3]. The
nCLU isoform is 55 kDa in size; it is generated initially
as a 49-kDa nCLU precursor protein (pnCLU) from the
second AUG codon by an alternative splicing event that
eliminates exon II, which encodes the first AUG codon and

Expression of eIF3f and CLU

development by performing Y2H screening, which
revealed that eIF3f is a CLU-interacting protein. eIF3f
is a subunit of the eIF3 complex, which consists of 13
non-identical subunits (eIF3 a-m). Together with eIF1,
eIF1A, and eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi, eIF3 binds to the
40S ribosomal subunit, which promotes the binding of
methionyl-tRNA and mRNA [21-24]. eIF3f expression is
downregulated in most cancer cells because of the loss of
the eIF3f allele [25-27]. eIF3f interacts with heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) and induces rRNA
degradation by interfering with the interaction between
hnRNP and rRNA, which subsequently inhibits protein
translation [25, 28]. Increased expression of eIF3f reduces
cellular growth by inducing apoptosis in melanoma and
pancreatic cancer cells [23-25]. In contrast, knocking
down eIF3f using siRNA in normal pancreatic HPDE
cells increased cell proliferation, migration, and
chemotherapeutic resistance [28]. This suggests that eIF3f
might be an important negative regulator of cell survival
and carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism
by which the increased expression of eIF3f induces
apoptosis is poorly understood. In the current study, we
found that eIF3f induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor
growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we assessed how
eIF3f affects cancer cell growth as well as its relationship
with CLU, and revealed the potential of eIF3f as an
effective cancer therapeutic target.

The cell lines used in the present study were selected
by examining the expression of eIF3f and CLU. Previous
studies revealed that eIF3f expression was downregulated
in most human tumors compared with normal tissues using
a cancer profiling array and qRT-PCR [25]. Therefore, we
compared eIF3f mRNA levels in six human cancer cell
lines (Miapaca-2, BxPc-3, HeLa, CASKI, SKOV3, and
2774) and a normal cell line (HEK293a) using qRT-PCR.
Miapaca-2 cells were used as a negative control [25],
and eIF3f mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH.
Consistent with a previous study [25], eIF3f mRNA
was decreased significantly by 60-80% in cancer cells
compared with normal cell line (Figure 2A). In addition,
the same cancer cell lines expressed different levels of
endogenous CLU protein; among these, HeLa cells had
the highest CLU expression (Figure 2B). Therefore, HeLa
and BxPc-3 cells were used in subsequent experiments
because of their relatively decreased eIF3f expression and
increased CLU expression.

The overexpression of eIF3f inhibits cancer cell
growth and induces apoptosis
Previously, qRT-PCR experiments revealed that
eIF3f was downregulated significantly in cancer cell lines
(Figure 2A). This suggests that decreased eIF3f expression
might play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Therefore, we
next evaluated the effect of eIF3f on cancer cell growth by
transfecting HeLa and BxPc-3 cells with empty vector or
an eIF3f expression vector, and then monitored the growth
rates for 24-72 h. Data revealed that eIF3f transfection
retarded cell growth compared with control cells in
a time-dependent manner. The eIF3f-induced growth
inhibition was ~40% more effective in HeLa than BxPc-3
cells after 72 h (Figure 3A, 3B). However, other cell lines
that express only low levels of CLU exhibited relatively
low growth inhibition in the presence of eIF3f (data not
shown). We then examined whether the inhibited cell
growth induced by eIF3f overexpression was associated
with increased apoptosis using flow cytometry. Data
revealed that apoptosis was increased significantly in HeLa
cells transfected with eIF3f compared with empty vector
alone (Figure 3C). To confirm these observations, cleaved
PARP, which is a marker of apoptosis, was analyzed by
Western blotting. Data revealed that the overexpression of
eIF3f increased cleaved PARP levels in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 3D, 3E). These results suggest that the
overexpression of eIF3f induces apoptosis in cancer cells,
and that the reduced number of eIF3f-transfected cells was
due to an increased level of spontaneous apoptosis.
We further compared the ability of these cell lines to
form colonies. Consistent with the cell growth data, eIF3ftransfected HeLa cells formed significantly fewer colonies

Results
eIF3f interacts with CLU in the cytoplasm
We first performed yeast two-hybrid screening to
identify novel CLU-interacting partners in cells. CLU
was used as the bait, and a human cDNA library was
used as the prey, and the results revealed that eIF3f was
a CLU binding partner (data not shown). The interaction
between CLU and eIF3f was confirmed by growth assays
and ß-galactosidase assays using a yeast two-hybrid
system. Co-transformants of CLU and eIF3f grew only
on leucine-deficient plates or appeared blue in color on
plates containing x-gal (Figure 1A). To further confirm
this observation, their interaction was assessed in vitro
using co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Figure 1B,
eIF3f was detected in immunoprecipitates using CLU
antibodies and vice versa in HEK293a cells. These results
suggest that CLU can bind directly to eIF3f. We next
assessed the subcellular localization of eIF3f and CLU
using immunocytochemistry. Figure 1C shows that eIF3f
and CLU were co-localized mainly in the cytoplasm.
Therefore, these results suggest that eIF3f and CLU
strongly interact with each other in the cytoplasm.

was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure 3F). Therefore,
eIF3f reduced cancer cell proliferation significantly.

with eIF3f, whereas the region between amino acids 1
and 169 of eIF3f interacts directly with CLU and was
phosphorylated by CDK11p46 during apoptosis [29, 30]
(Figures 4A, 4B). These results suggest that eIF3f might
affect the function of CLU by interacting with the α-chain
of sCLU (1-227 amino acids).

eIF3f interacts with the α-chain of sCLU
To identify the specific region responsible for the
interaction between CLU and eIF3f, we generated four
deletion constructs for CLU and eIF3f each and performed
yeast two-hybrid assays. As shown in Figure 4, the region
between amino acids 1 and 227 of CLU interacts directly

were isolated from HeLa and BxPc-3 cells transfected with
CLU or eIF3f and then analyzed by Western blotting using
CLU antibodies. High levels of psCLU and α/β CLU were
detected in whole cell lysates of CLU-transfected cells.
In contrast, eIF3f-transfected cells expressed decreased
levels of both psCLU and α/β CLU. In addition, cotransfection with CLU and eIF3f resulted in a depletion of
sCLU expression compared with transfection with CLU
only (Figure 5A).
The secretion of sCLU was confirmed in culture
medium from cells treated under the same conditions.
Similarly, the overexpression of CLU increased the
secretion of sCLU, whereas the overexpression of eIF3f
decreased the secretion of sCLU significantly (Figure
5B). These results suggest that eIF3f might interact with
CLU protein to reduce the expression of sCLU in both

intracellular and extracellular compartments by preventing
structural changes.

eIF3f overexpression activates p53 and Bax and
inhibits Akt and ERK signaling
To assess whether the overexpression of eIF3f
inhibits the function of CLU, we next measured the
expression of several proteins that induce apoptosis.
HeLa cells were cultured in the absence or presence
of eIF3f for 24 and 48 h. As shown in Figure 6, eIF3f
transfection in HeLa cells upregulated the expression
of the apoptotic proteins p53, p21, and Bax (Figure
6A). Conversely, depletion of sCLU caused by eIF3f
overexpression reduced the phosphorylation of both Akt

with CLU or eIF3f expression vectors. Forty-eight hours after transfection, whole cell lysates A. and culture media B. were harvested. The
expression and secretion of sCLU were detected using Western blotting. GAPDH blots and Coomassie staining confirmed equal protein

and ERK compared with control HeLa cells. In addition,
eIF3f decreased the phosphorylation of GSK-3β and
expression of Elk-1 and Egr-1, downstream factors of Akt
and ERK, respectively (Figure 6B). This suggests that
eIF3f overexpression suppressed the signaling pathways
activated by sCLU. Therefore, eIF3f inhibits cancer
cell growth and induces apoptosis by inhibiting sCLU
function.

Therefore, HeLa cells were treated with cycloheximide to
inhibit protein translation, and then the p53 degradation
rate was compared between eIF3f- and control-transfected
cells. As shown in Figure 7B, eIF3f increased and
stabilized the levels of endogenous p53. These results
suggest that eIF3f promotes the tumor suppressor function
of p53 by increasing the stability of p53 protein.
We next defined the relationship among p53, p21,
and Bax during eIF3f-induced apoptosis. SKOV3 p53−/−
cells were transfected with eIF3f or p53. Transfection
with eIF3f resulted in the accumulation of p21 in p53transfected cells, whereas Bax was activated in both
p53-transfected and un-transfected cells. In addition,
Bax expression was increased to a greater extent in cells
transfected with both p53 and eIF3f compared with p53
alone. Western blotting then revealed that the upregulation
of p21 after eIF3f overexpression was p53-dependent,
whereas Bax activation was both p53-dependent and
-independent (Figure 7C).

eIF3f increases the stability of p53
A previous result revealed that eIF3f increases
p53 protein levels (Figure 6A). Therefore, we assessed
how eIF3f inhibits p53 expression using qRT-PCR and
cycloheximide (CHX) assays. We first measured whether
eIF3f affects p53 levels. qRT-PCR revealed that eIF3f
did not stimulate the upregulation of p53 mRNA (Figure
7A), suggesting that eIF3f does not inhibit p53 levels.
Therefore, we hypothesized that eIF3f might stabilizes
p53, because sCLU inhibits the p53 stability [31].

with pcDNA4-eIF3f, and harvested at 24-h intervals. The expression of eIF3f, psCLU, α/β-CLU, p53, p21, and Bax A. and phosphorylated

eIF3f-induced apoptotic signal is related to
inhibition of CLU

eIF3f inhibits tumor growth in vivo
We next explored whether eIF3f inhibits tumor
growth in vivo. Exponentially growing HeLa cervical
cancer cells were transfected transiently with eIF3f
expression or control vector, and the cells were injected
subcutaneously into immune-deficient BALB/c nude mice.
Animals (5-7 per group) were then monitored for tumor
growth and morphology for 33 days. Figure 9A shows that
the tumor mass in mice transfected with pCDNA3-eIF3f
was diminished significantly compared with tumors in
mice transfected with control vector. Collectively, these
results suggest that eIF3f had obvious antitumor effects.
Paraffin sections of tumor tissue were stained by H&E
for histological analysis. The control showed high-grade
carcinoma with an irregular cell distribution. In contrast,
eIF3f treated tumor exhibited large areas of apoptotic cells
(Figure 9B). We next investigated the inhibitory effect of

The previous figures show that eIF3f inhibited CLU
expression and induced apoptotic signal. So, we examined
whether this effect is especially mediated by inhibition of
CLU. Knockdown of eIF3f in the HEK293a cells increased
the CLU expression at 72h post transfection (Figure 8A).
As shown in Figure 8B, CLU expression was diminished
in eIF3f overexpressed HeLa cells, wheras it was restored
to its original expression by transfection of eIF3f siRNA.
Furthermore, expression of downstream factors of CLU
was also returned to their intrinsic expression, together.
These results suggest that anti-proliferative effect of eIF3f
is caused by inhibition of CLU.

siRNA (siCON) or eIF3f siRNA (sieIF3f) for 72h. Whole cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting. B. HeLa cells were transiently

eIF3f on CLU expression and Akt and ERK signaling
pathway in tumor tissues harvested from control and
eIF3f treated mice. eIF3f transfection was observed to
significantly decrease the psCLU and α/β CLU expression
and inhibit Akt and ERK phosphorylation. And the cleaved
PARP, a apoptosis marker level was increased (Figure 9C).
Collectively, these results clearly demonstrate that eIF3f
can be a potent tumor suppressor in this animal model.

(data not shown). Therefore, because eIF3f interacts with
CLU, the effect of eIF3f on cell proliferation requires the
expression of CLU.
To assess how eIF3f inhibits CLU activity, we
generated several deletion constructs and analyzed the
specific sites responsible for the binding between eIF3f
and CLU. Data revealed that eIF3f binds with the α-chain
of sCLU encoded by amino acids 1-227 (Figure 4).
Generally, sCLU is expressed highly in cancer, in which
it plays roles as a pro-survival factor in tumor progression
and metastasis [38, 39, 40]. sCLU is generated as an
unglycosylated precursor protein (psCLU) that is cleaved
proteolytically into α- and β-subunits, which are then held
together by disulfide bonds, and the protein is secreted
[1, 3]. Therefore, we hypothesized that eIF3f disrupts
the cleavage of sCLU or the interaction between the αand β-subunits by interacting directly with the α-subunit.
Indeed, increasing the expression of eIF3f reduces the
amount of sCLU precursor, α/β-CLU expression, and
sCLU secretion from the cell (Figures 5, 6A). These results
suggest that eIF3f activates the structural modification of
sCLU into its mature form, which results in decreased
sCLU expression and secretion. In addition, the CLU
promoter is activated by IGF-1R/Src/MAPK signaling
[41]. Decreased sCLU levels in cells overexpressing
eIF3f inhibit ERK activation and Egr-1 expression (Figure
6B). These data suggest that depleted Egr-1 expression
reduces psCLU expression by inhibiting CLU promoter
transcriptional activity.
In osteosarcoma U2-OS cells, sCLU depletion
induced Bax activation by suppressing Bcl-2 protein and
stabilizing p53, which leads to the activation of p21 and
Bax genes [31]. Moreover, sCLU regulates mitochondrial
apoptosis by stabilizing the cytosolic Ku70-Bax protein
complex. Bax is maintained in an inactive form in the
cytosol by binding to Ku70. sCLU stabilizes the Ku70Bax complex and inhibits the conformational change in
Bax and its subsequent translocation to the mitochondria
[31, 42]. In addition, α-chain of sCLU binds directly
with activated Bax and prevents the oligomerization of
Bax, thereby suppressing the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
[43]. Consistent with previous reports, the current study
demonstrated that the overexpression of eIF3f enhanced
p53, p21, and activated Bax levels in a time-dependent
manner in HeLa cervical cancer cells (Figure 6A). In
addition, eIF3f elevated p21 in only a p53-dependent
manner in SKOV3 p53-/- cells but elevated Bax in both
p53-dependent and -independent manners (Figure 7C).
Therefore, we hypothesized that eIF3f disrupts the
stability of the Ku70-Bax complex because eIF3f binds
to sCLU to deplete the expression of sCLU. However,
it remains unclear whether eIF3f disrupts this complex.
Furthermore, the present study identified a previously
unrecognized pathway that links sCLU depletion to p53
activation. Interestingly, eIF3f did not alter the levels of
p53 mRNA but stabilized p53 protein (Figure 7A,7B).

Discussion
Changes in CLU expression were related to tumor
stage and grade [17]. The upregulated expression of CLU
was associated with highly aggressive breast carcinoma [9,
32] and with tumor progression and recurrence in bladder
cancer [33]. The overexpression of CLU was detected
in metastatic ovarian and cervical cancer compared
with matched normal tissues [15, 34]. In addition, the
transfection of CLU into human renal carcinoma cells
enhanced cancer cell survival and metastatic potential
[35, 36]. Moreover, CLU gene silencing in human bladder
and prostate cancers inhibited growth and increased their
chemosensitivity [33, 37]. Although a number of studies
analyzed CLU expression in relation to tumorigenesis, the
details of its biological roles and regulatory mechanisms
in human cancer cells remain unknown. Therefore,
understanding the mechanism of action of CLU in cancer
cells is essential for the development of novel effective
cancer treatments.
This study shows the crucial function of eIF3f as a
novel potent antitumor agent that inhibits the function of
anti-apoptotic factor CLU. Herein, we suggest a possible
mechanism behind the eIF3f-induced inhibition of tumor
growth that involves the direct binding of eIF3f to CLU,
which inhibits sCLU-induced activation of Akt and ERK
signaling.
eIF3f is a subunit of the mammalian eIF3 complex,
which binds to the 40S ribosome and promotes the
binding of methionyl-tRNA and mRNA [21]. However,
loss of the eIF3f gene has been observed in melanoma and
pancreatic cancer, which results in the downregulation
of eIF3f [26, 27]. Similarly, several previous studies
reported that eIF3f expression was reduced in cervical and
ovarian cancer by ~60-70%. Moreover, increased eIF3f
inhibits translation and cell growth and induces apoptosis
in melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells [25]. These
reports suggest that the downregulation of eIF3f might
be the major cause of cancer pathogenesis. However, its
function in cancer remains unclear. The current results
revealed that eIF3f expression was decreased dramatically
in human pancreatic, cervical, and ovarian cancer cells
(Figure 2), consistent with the above mentioned studies.
In addition, eIF3f reduces cell growth and increases
apoptosis significantly in HeLa and BxPc-3 cells (Figure
3). However, interestingly, these effects were minimal
in cell lines that express low levels of endogenous CLU

However, understanding the mechanism behind these
effects requires further investigation.
The current data in HeLa cells revealed that
transfection with eIF3f reduced the phosphorylation of
Akt and ERK and inhibited the downstream pathways
pGSK-3β, Elk-1, and Egr-1. However, there are several
pathways downstream of Akt and ERK. Therefore, the
identification of other effects requires further study.
Recently we reported PACAP as a CLU binding protein
[44]. Interestingly, eif3f interacts with α-chain but PACAP
binds with β-chain of CLU. And PACAP showed weaker
but similar CLU suppression function with eif3f. So the
further study of the regulatory mechanism of eif3f and
PACAP on CLU may valuable.
In conclusion, the current study revealed a novel
function of eIF3f as a regulator of the survival factor
sCLU in human tumors. The data also suggest that eIF3f
inhibits cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis by
blocking the function of sCLU, thereby suppressing the
inactivation of p53 and Bax as well as the Akt and ERK
pathways. This newly discovered mechanism might lead
to the future development of effective CLU-targeting
therapies for cancer patients

Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)

Materials and Methods

Cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (20mM
Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150mM NaCl, 1% Nonident P-40, 1mM
PMSF) for 30min on ice. Extracts were centrifuged at
13,000rpm for 10min at 4oC, and the protein concentration
was measured using the Bradford assay. Each cell lysate
(1.5mg) was incubated with CLU polyclonal antibody
(Santa cruz) or flag monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for
overnight at 4oC. Following incubation, protein was
immunoprecipitated using protein A/G agarose beads
(Santa cruz) for 3hr at 4oC with gently rotation. The
immunoprecipitates was washed three times with lysis
buffer and boiled in 40oC of 1X SDS sample buffer for
5min at 95oC. After centrifugation, the supernatant was
analyzed by Western blot.

Cell culture and transfection
HEK293a, HeLa, BxPc-3 and SKOV3 cell
lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were incubated at 37oC
in a humidity 5% CO2 incubator, and cultured in each
recommended medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, WelGENE) and 1% Amphotericin
B/Streptomycin/Penicillin (Gibco). Cell transfection
was performed using the X-tremeGENE HP reagent
(Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Immunocytochemistry (ICC)

Construction of plasmids

Cells were grown on 18mm diameter cover glass
(Marienfeld). After 48hr incubation, the cells were
rinsed twice with 1X PBS and fixed and permeabilized
in methanol-acetone mixture (1:1) for 7min at -20oC.
Fixed cells were blocked with 5% BSA/PBS-T (PBS,
0.2% Tween-20) for 1hr at room temperature, and then
incubated with CLU polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution)
and eIF3f polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution) for
overnight at 4oC. The cells were washed three times with
1X PBS for 5min each and incubated with alexa fluor 488
goat anti-rabbit IgG (Green) and alexa fluor 568 donkey
anti-goat IgG (Red) antibody (Invitrogen, 1000:1 dilution)
in darkness for 1hr at room temperature. Finally, the cells

pOTB7-eIF3f plasmid was provided from Korea
Human Gene Bank, Medical Genomics Research center,

temperature and mounted on slides. The signals and colocalization were detected using the confocal fluorescene
microscopy.

The cell viability was examined by the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. HeLa and Bxpc-3 cells
were seeded in 96-well plates and transiently transfected.
CCK-8 reagent was treated to each well and incubated
for 1hr at 24hr intervals. The O.D value was measured at
450nm in triplicate.
For colony formation assay, transfected cells were
grown at 1,000 cells per 100mm cell culture dish in
triplicate. Then, the cells were incubated to allow colonies
to form for 2weeks. After the incubation, cells were
washed twice with 1X PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(Sigma) for 15min, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet
(in D.W, Sigma) at room temperature for 15min. The
plates were rinsed with water and total colony number
was counted.

Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR)
All RNA from cells was extracted by using TRIZOL
reagent (Invitrogen), and the cDNA was synthesized with
1 μg of total RNA using IscriptTM select cDNA synthesis
kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was performed using 2X
SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in MiniOpticonTM
system. All experimental procedures were carried out
according to the manufacturer’s standard protocols.
The PCR reaction mixture (total volume of 20 μl) was
consisted of the following: 5ng of cDNA, 10 μl of 2X
SYBR Green Supermix and 5pM of both forward and

Preparation of protein extracts

Knockdown of eIF3f expression by siRNA

Cell pellets were resuspended in RIPA buffer (50mM
Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5mM PMSF) for 30min on ice.
The extracts were centrifuged at 13,000rpm for 10min at
4oC , and the protein concentration was determined using
the Bradford assay.
Secreted protein in medium was prepared using the
TCA (trichloroacetic acid) precipitation. 1ml of culture
medium was precipitated with 250 μl of 100% TCA for
30min on ice. Pellet was washed twice with pre-cooled
acetone, dried at 95oC for 5min, and resuspended in 100
μl of 1X SDS sample buffer by neutralizing with 1M TrisHCl (pH 8.0). After centrifugation, the supernatant was
used for Western blot.

eIF3f siRNA and scramble siRNA were synthesized
by siRNA kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. The target sequence of the eIF3f is:
5’-AAAGGTGTCAGCTGACAATAC -3’. Scramble
siRNA oligonucleotide was included in the kit. eIF3f
siRNA or scramble siRNA was transfected in to the cells
using the Lipofectamine RNAi/Max reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were
harvested and cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was performed using the
Excel software (Microsoft Excel, 2010). Differences
between experimental groups were compared by ANOVA
and t-test. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Each experiment was repeated more than three
times and the data were presented as mean±SD.

Western blot
Protein extracts were prepared as described
above, then separated by SDS-PAGE using 8 to 15%
polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane (Bio-Rad, 0.45µM). The membranes were
blocked for 1hr in 5% skim milk and incubated at 4oC
for overnight with specific primary antibody. Antibodies
against CLU (sc-6419), p53(sc-6243), p21 (sc-397), Bax
(sc-493), pERK (sc-7383), Elk-1 (sc-355), Egr-1 (sc189), GSK-3β (sc-8257) and GAPDH (sc-25778) were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies
against p-Akt (#4060), pGSK-3β (#9331) and cleaved
PARP (#9541) were purchased from Cell signaling.
Antibodies against eIF3f (638202), Akt (1085-1) and
flag (F1804) were purchased from Biolegend, EPITMICS and Sigma aldrich, respectively. Following
primary antibody incubation, the membranes were
washed three times for 5min in 1X TBS-T, incubated for
1hr with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody. Immunoreactivity was detected using ECL
chemiluminescent solution (advansta) and exposed by
Chemidoc (Bio-Rad).
