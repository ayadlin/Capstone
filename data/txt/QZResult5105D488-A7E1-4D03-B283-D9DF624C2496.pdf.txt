ABSTRACT
Despite its relative rarity, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts
for a large percentage of cancer deaths. In this study, we investigated the in vitro
efficacy of OSI-027, a selective inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin complex
1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2, to treat PDAC cell lines alone, and in combination with
gemcitabine (GEM). Similarly, we tested the efficacy of these two compounds in a
xenograft mouse model of PDAC. OSI-027 significantly arrested cell cycle in G0/
G1 phase, inhibited the proliferation of Panc-1, BxPC-3, and CFPAC-1 cells, and
downregulated mTORC1, mTORC2, phospho-Akt, phospho-p70S6K, phospho-4EBP1, cyclin D1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) in these cells. Moreover, OSI027 also downregulated multidrug resistance (MDR)-1, which has been implicated
in chemotherapy resistance in PDAC cells and enhanced apoptosis induced by GEM
in the three PDAC cell lines. When combined, OSI-027 with GEM showed synergistic
cytotoxic effects both in vitro and in vivo. This is the first evidence of the efficacy of
OSI-027 in PDAC and may provide the groundwork for a new clinical PDAC therapy.

first-line chemotherapy, but gemcitabine (GEM), another
nucleoside analogue, has shown greater efficacy and has
usurped the former as the standard chemotherapy [5].
However, even with GEM treatment, 5-year survival rates
from PDAC remain still low at just over 20% [6].
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is
an atypical serine/threonine kinase that amalgamates
many different cellular processes, including cell
growth and metabolism [7, 8]. mTOR pathways
are often aberrantly activated in a wide variety of
tumors, and the hyperactivated mTOR pathways
contribute to tumor proliferation and survival [9,
10, 11, 12]. mTOR consists of two complexes,
mTOR complex (C) 1, and mTORC2, the former
being implicated in protein synthesis [13, 14, 15],
while the latter regulates the cytoskeleton [13, 14, 15].

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the
twelfth most common cancer worldwide, with an incidence
of 6 to 8 people per 100, 000 males in developed countries
[1, 2]. However, despite its relatively low incidence,
PDAC is the fourth most deadly cancer [3], and more than
95% of patients are expected to die from it in five years
[4], which is a consequence of its asymptomatic nature
and thus it is often diagnostic after it is well-advanced [2].
Although surgical resection is the preferred
treatment for PDAC, the advanced stage at diagnosis
renders most tumors inoperable. Thus, there has been
much research investigating novel treatments for this
disease. Fluorouracil (5-FU) was traditionally used as

mTORC1 forms a complex with various proteins,
mainly regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor),
while mTORC2 combines with rapamycin-insensitive
companion of mTOR (Rictor). Rapamycin (RAPA), the
drug of the mTOR namesake, inhibits mTORC1 and
has shown some promise for treating metastatic renal
cancer [16], prostate cancer [17], and PDAC [18, 19].
However, it does not suppress mTORC2. Recent studies
have shown that inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2 is
advantageous for treating leukemia and other cancers
[20, 21].
OSI-027 is an orally bioavailable, specific and
potent ATP-competitive mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor
that is currently in phase II clinical trials. It has shown
greater promise than RAPA in preclinical studies involving
a variety of tumor types, such as Leukemia [22, 23],
lymphomas [24], hepatocellular carcinoma [25], and
colorectal cancer [26]. However, the effect of OSI-027 in
PDAC remains unclear. Thus, in this study, the effects of
OSI-027 were examined in vitro and in an in vivo PDAC
model in combination with GEM.

important in the regulation of cell cycle. RAPA only
inhibited mTOR (ser2481) and p70S6K phosphorylation
(P < 0.05); however, it up-regulated p-Akt and had no
significant effect on 4E-BP-1 phosphorylation, and the
expression of Cyclin D1 and CDK4 (Figure 2B).

Effects of Raptor and Rictor on cell cycle in
PDAC cells
In order to confirm the role of mTOR pathway in the
regulation of cell cycle, we performed small interfering
(si) RNA knock-out in Panc-1, BxPC-3, and CFPAC-1
cells, and found that siRNA application successfully
knocked down the expression of mTOR, Raptor (mTOR1)
and Rictor (mTOR2) in these cells. Cell cycle analyses
showed that Raptor siRNA had no effect on the cell cycle;
however, Rictor siRNA, total mTOR siRNA, and Akt
siRNA all significantly increased the proportion of cells
in the G0/G1 phase (Figure 3A), suggesting that ibhibit
mTOR2 in PDAC may be a viable approach to inhibit
cell growth. Western blot analyses revealed that while
Raptor siRNA increased Akt phosphorylation, it exerted
no effect on Cyclin D1 or CDK4 expression (Figure 3B).
Conversely, Rictor siRNA and mTOR siRNA both
inhibited Akt phosphorylation and downregulated Cyclin
D1 and CDK4 expression. When Akt was knocked out in
the pancreatic three cell lines, the expression of Cyclin D1,
CDK4, and MDR1 were all subsequently downregulated
(Figure 3C).

RESULTS
The effects of OSI-027 and RAPA on PDAC cell
line viability and cell cycle
OSI-027 significantly reduced cell viability in
PDAC cell lines (Panc-1, BxPC-3, and CFPAC-1)
compared to controls after 24 hours of treatment, whereas
RAPA had little effect (P < 0.05; Figure 1A). The IC50 of
OSI-027 is shown in Table 1. The cytotoxicity of OSI-027
(10 μM) was time-dependent and RAPA still had no effects
on PDAC cells after 48 and 72 hours drug treatment
(Figure 1B). Edu incorporation showed that OSI-027 also
significantly inhibited DNA synthesis. Conversely, RAPA
had little effect on the proliferation of these PDAC cells
(P < 0.05; Figure 1C). Flow cytometry assay showed 5
μM OSI-027 induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase
in Panc-1, BxPC-3, and CFPAC-1 cells, whereas RAPA
had little effect on cell cycle. Moreover, 10 μM OSI-027
further upregulated the proportion of cells arrested in G0/
G1 phase (Figure 2A).

The effects of OSI-027 and GEM on PDAC cell lines
In the test of synergistic effect of OSI-027 and
GEM, CCK-8 assay revealed that the combination of
OSI-027 and GEM was more cytotoxic in all three cell
lines compared to either treatment alone (Figure 4A).
Moreover, CI analysis showed that combination
treatment had a synergistic killing effect in all three cell
lines (Table 1).
Apoptosis analysis revealed that OSI-027 could
not induce cell apoptosis; however, when combined with
GEM, it significantly enhanced apoptosis induced by
GEM (Figure 4B).

The effects of OSI-027 and combination

To further investigate the underlying mechanism
by which OSI-027 induced cell cycle arrest, we tested the
changes of mTOR pathway proteins after treatment of OSI027 and RAPA, Western blot analyses showed that both
5 μM and 10 μM OSI-027 inhibited phosphorylation of
mTOR (ser2481), mTOR (ser2448), Akt, and downstream
effectors of the mTOR pathway, including p-4E-BP-1 and
p-p70S6K. Moreover, OSI-027 significantly downregulated
the expression of Cyclin D1 and CDK4, which was

MDR1 mRNA and the MDR1 protein were significantly

expression induced by CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor,
in Panc-1, BxPC and CFPCA-1. Moreover, OSI-027
reversed the upregulation of MDR1 expression induced
by MG123, which is a protein degradation inhibitor
(Figure 4E), suggesting that OSI-027 downregulated the

(0.24 ± 0.09 g) compared to either treat­ment alone (Figure
6A–6C). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed OSI-027 could
not induce PDAC cells apoptosis; however, it enhanced
the apoptosis induced by GEM. Immunohistochemical
assay showed that both OSI-027 and GEM could inhibited
the proliferation of PDAC cells compared to control, and
combined treatment with OSI-027 and GEM showed a
greater capacity to proliferation inhibition than monotherapy (Figure 6D). Moreover, OSI-027 mono-therapy
had little effect on the body weight of experimental mice
and did not increase the body weight loss induced by
GEM. Besides the influence on body weight, OSI-027
had no effect on the AST and ALT in nude mouse blood
samples and did not increase the AST and ALT raise
induced by GEM. Neither mono-therapy nor combined
therapy had effects on BUN (Figure 6E).

PDAC is a deadly disease with limited treatment
options. Moreover, surgical tumor removal, heralded as
the most effective treatment, is suitable in less than 20% of
patients [5]. Although there has been some progress with
respect to the development of novel, targeted therapies in
PDAC, such as GEM, more therapeutics are desperately
needed. One such potential molecule, OSI-027 has been
shown to inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2, which are
aberrantly activated in the vast majority of pancreatic
tumors [9, 10]. Moreover, OSI-027 has shown promise for
the treatment of several malignancies, including head and
neck, bladder, and breast cancer [21, 27, 28]. Therefore,
we investigated, for the first time, the in vitro and in vitro
effects of OSI-027 in pancreatic cell lines and in a PDAC
xenograft model.

OSI-027 reduced MDR-1 expression at both the protein and RNA level (**P < 0.01). E. CHX with OSI-027 significantly reduced MDR1

the control.

Herein, we showed that OSI-027 was more effective
than RAPA, which is known to only inhibit mTORC1, at
inhibiting the proliferation of three distinct pancreatic cell
lines. Moreover, studies have shown that greater RAPA
sensitivity in cell lines results in greater Akt activation,
thereby attenuating treatment efficacy [29]. Thus, we
further investigated the implications of OSI-027 treatment
on downstream Akt effectors. As a consequence of
blocking mTORC1 and mTORC2, unlike RAPA that only
blocks mTORC1, cell cycle regulators and downstream
effectors of Akt activation, including cyclin D1 and CDK4,
were downregulated. Thus, the two-pronged mTOR
approach with OSI-027 appears more beneficial than only
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

targeting mTORC1 with RAPA in PDAC. Evidence from
other cancers support this theory, as mTORC2 inhibition
has been shown to be effective for inhibiting colon cancer
cell proliferation [30]. Moreover, in leukemia, targeting
both mTORC1 and mTORC2 exhibited significant
suppressive effects, decreases Akt activation, and induces
apoptosis [20, 31, 32].
We also investigated the effects of OSI027 combination therapy with the first-line
chemotherapeutic agent GEM; in vitro and in vivo
experiments both showed synergistic effects. In vitro,
OSI-027 downregulated MDR1, which has been shown
to suppress apoptotic stimuli [33]. Thus, we believe

that OSI-027 enhanced the killing effect of GEM by
downregulating MDR-1 expression. Moreover, although
most pancreatic tumors initially show sensitivity to
GEM therapy, patients quickly become resistant to this
treatment [34], in which MDR-1 is typically implicated
[35]. Thus, in addition to increasing the effectiveness
of the cell killing effect of GEM, OSI-027 may also
delay drug resistance, a hypothesis that requires further
investigation. In head and neck cancer, it was shown
that inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC1 increased
sensitivity to epidermal growth factor inhibitors; thus,
we believe that OSI-027 should be used with other
chemotherapy agents, such as GEM, to increase their
efficacy [21].
In a xenograft mouse model using Panc-1 cells,
the combination treatment of OSI-027 with GEM
significantly reduced tumor weight and volume relative

to either treatment as a mono-therapy. As a common
side-effect of GEM therapy is difficulty eating and
weight loss, we were further encouraged by the lack of
additional weight loss when GEM was combined with
OSI-027.
This study is not without several limitations. For
instance, in order to determine the effects of mTORC2
on cell cycle, we only downregulated its expression using
OSI-027; it remains to be seen whether upregulation
of mTORC2 has a positive effect on cell proliferation.
Secondly, we only observed the relationship between
phospho-Akt and MDR1; more in depth analyses
are required to further elucidate the implications and
mediators of this interaction.
In this study, we explored the important
roles of mTORC1 mTORC2 in the proliferation of
PDAC cells, and provided evidence of the efficacy

of a new compound, OSI-027, in PDAC. Moreover,
downregulating mTORC1/mTORC2 may also reduce
drug resistance in PDAC, which is a common occurrence
in the clinic. Finally, OSI-027 combined with GEM
showed synergistic killing action, suggesting that it
might be a potent combination in the fight against PDAC
and should be tested in further studies.

cultured in high glucose DMEM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco)
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA). BxPC-3 was cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and were transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked
with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 containing 5%
bovine serum albumin and were incubated with specific
primary antibodies (all 1:1, 000 dilution). Six hours later,
membranes were washed (3 times; 30 minutes) with Trisbuffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 followed by incubated
with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibodies (all 1:2, 000 dilution). All antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology except
anti-Cyclin D1 (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA) and the
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Beyotime Institute
of Biotechnology, Shanghai, People’s Republic of China).

Effects of OSI-027 and RAPA on PDAC cells
Prior to experimentation, cells were plated at a density
of 3000 cells per well in 96-well plates and the media was
removed and replaced by serum free media; 24 hours later
the serum free media was replaced by complete media with
the addition of OSI-027 (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and
80 μM; Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) or RAPA
(0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μM; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA). Using the Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8
(KeyGEN BioTech, Nanjing, People’s Republic of China),
we determined cytotoxicity and the half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) at 24 hours. In order to detect the
cytotoxicity of OSI-027 and RAPA at different time points,
PDAC cells were cultured as previously described, and the
serum free media was replaced by complete media with
the addition of OSI-027 (10 μM) and RAPA (100 nM), the
cytotoxicity of OSI-027 and RAPA was tested at 24, 48,
and 72 hours after drug treatment. Cell proliferation was
determined using different concentrations of OSI-027 (5
and 10 μM in Panc-1, BxPC-3, and CFPAC-1) and RAPA
(100 nM) with the Cell-light EdU Apollo 488 in vitro kit
(RIBOBIO, Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China) as per
the manufacturer’s instructions.

mTOR knockdown in pancreatic cell lines
Using siRNA, the expression of mTOR, mTOR1 and
mTOR2 was knocked down in PDAC cell lines. Transfections
were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Six hours later, the transfection medium was
replaced by complete medium. mTOR siRNA (GenePharma,
Shanghai, China), mTOR1 siRNA (GenePharma, Shanghai,
China), mTOR2 siRNA (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) and
negative-control siRNA (GenePharma, Shanghai, China)
were transfected into cells at a concentration of 100 nM. The
efficiency of siRNA interference was evaluated using Western
blot as previous described.

OSI-027 and GEM
Next, we tested the cytotoxicity of OSI-027 (0,
1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 μM) , GEM (0, 0.125, 0.25,
0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 μM) and the combination of OSI-027 and
GEM in the three PDAC cell lines to determine if they
had a synergistic effect according to combination index
(CI; CI = (IC50)C1/(IC50)S or P+(IC50)C2/(IC50)D. Where CI ≤
0.9, > 0.9 and < 1.1, ≥ 1.1 indicate synergism, additive
effect, and antagonistic effect, respectively), which was
introduced by Chou and Talalay [36]. We also used
flow cytometry to assess apoptosis; PDAC cell lines
were treated with GEM (Panc-1: 40 μM; BxPC-3 and
CFPAC-1: 1 μM), OSI-027 (Panc-1: 20 μM; BxPC-3
and CFPAC-1: 10 μM) and their combination, 24 hours
later cells were harvested and washed twice with icecold PBS, stained by Annexin V-PE/7AAD apoptosis kit
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s introduction, and analyzed by a
BD FACS Caliber flow cytometer using BD Cell Quest
software.

Effects of OSI-027 and RAPA on cell cycle
In order to determine the effects of OSI-027 and
RAPA on cell cycle, we performed flow cytometry. Briefly,
PDAC cells were treated with OSI-027 (Panc-1, BxPC3, and CFPAC-1: 5 and 10 μM) and RAPA (100 nM), 24
hours later cells were washed three times with ice-cold
PBS, DNA was stained with propidium iodide (PI; Dawen,
Shanghai, China) and flow cytometry. Quantitative cell
cycle analysis was conducted using ModFit software (Verity
Software House, Topsham, ME, USA). Cell proliferation
was expressed as the percentage of S + G2/M phase cells.

as previously described.
As the Akt pathway has been shown to regulate
MDR1 activity [37], we knocked down Akt expression
in these same cells using Akt siRNA (GenePharma,
Shanghai, China), and observed MDR1 changes in order
to determine if OSI-027 regulated MDR1 expression
through Akt. Moreover, we assessed MDR1 levels via
Western blot in cells that were treated with the following
drug combinations: OSI-027 (Panc-1: 20 μM; BxPC-3
and CFPAC-1: 10 μM) + cycloheximide (CHX; 1 μM;
Sigma-Aldrich); OSI-027 (Panc-1: 20 μM; BxPC-3
and CFPAC-1: 10 μM) + MG-132 (100 μg/mL; SigmaAldrich); MG-132 mono-therapy; and CHX monotherapy.
As with Akt, CHX (synthesis inhibition) and MG-132
(protein degradation) were selected to determine if OSI027 suppressed MDR1 via inhibiting its synthesis.
In order to confirm that OSI-027 enhanced the
sensitivity of PDAC to GEM was through inhibiting
MDR1 levels, we knocked down MDR1 expression using
siRNA, and determined the effects of this treatment on
genetic and protein levels. We also determined the IC50
of the OSI-027 + GEM combination (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10,
20, 40, 80 μM; and 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 μM,
respectively) on cell lines that had previously been treated
with MDR1 siRNA using CCK-8 as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.

combination group). The GEM group was injected with
GEM (25 mg/kg/d; dissolved in PBS) via caudal vein;
OSI-027 group was treated with OSI-027 (30 mg/kg/d;
dissolved in 20% Trappsol [CTD Holdings Inc, Alachua,
FL, USA]) orally; the combination group was treated
with GEM (25 mg/kg/d) and OSI-027 (30 mg/kg/d) as
previously described; and the control group was injected
with equal quantity of vehicle via caudal vein. Changes
in mouse body weight were monitored throughout the
study, tumor growth was observed every 2 days and was
calculated by the formula: tumor volume = length × width ×
height/2. Mice were sacrificed at day 16, tumors were
excised, weighed, and volume was measured for between
group comparisons. Finally, 0.5 mL of blood was obtained
from each nude mouse by cardiac puncture and send to
clinical laboratory to detect liver and kidney function.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and
immunohistochemical assay
Tumor tissues were fixed in 10% formalin before
embedded in paraffin and4 μm thick sections were
prepared. The In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN,
USA) was used to detect cellular apoptosis in tumor
tissue according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells
with brown stained were considered apoptotic cells.
For immunohistochemistry staining, the slides were
incubated with human anti-Ki67 (Sigma-aldrich, USA)
(1:400) antibody followed by incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit
immunoglobulin using Histostain-Plus Kit (Haoran-Bio,
Shanghai, China), Finally, the sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin and incubated the negative controls with
PBS instead of the specific primary antibody. Five sections
per tumor tissue were examined.

Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR
Cells were treated with vehicle or OSI-027
(Panc-1, BxPC-3 and CFPAC-1: 10 and 20 μM) for 24
hours or interfered using MDR1 siRNA as described
in section 5. Total RNA was extracted and reverse
transcribed using TRIzol Reagents (Invitrogen,
Shanghai, China) and Prime Script reagent RT Kit
(Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers for MDR1
were designed and obtained from Takara (forward,
5ʹ-TGACTCAGGAGCAGAAGTTTGAACA-3ʹ; reverse,
5ʹ-AAATACATCATTGCCTGGGTGAAG-3ʹ).
Realtime qPCR was performed on the ABI Prism 7900HT
Real-Time System (Applied Biosystems Inc, Shanghai,
People’s Republic of China), and MDR1 mRNA
expression level was normalized to that of β-actin
(forward, 5ʹ-TGGCACCCAGCACAATGAA-3ʹ; reverse,
5ʹ-CTAAGTCATAGTCCGCCTAGAAGCA-3ʹ).

Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated at least three times
and data are presented as means and standard deviation
(SD) values. Prism5 (GraphPad, SanDiego, CA, USA) was
use to perform Statistical analysis. Statistical significance
was defined as P-value < 0.05 using Student’s t-test
between different groups.
