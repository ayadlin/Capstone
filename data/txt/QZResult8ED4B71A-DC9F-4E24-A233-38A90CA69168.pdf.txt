BACKGROUND. Survival rates for gastrointestinal (GI) and bronchopulmonary (BP)
neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have not significantly altered (overall 67%, 5-year
survival) in 30 years (1973-2004), whereas the incidence has increased
(  1000%) in the same time frame. No effective or specific antineoplastic agent
is available for treatment, although somatostatin analogs inhibit tumor secretion.
Given the coexistence of somatostatin and dopamine regulatory receptors on
NET cells, the antiproliferative efficacy as well as the signaling and transcrip-

METHODS. The cytotoxic effects of 12 somatostatin/dopamine compounds were
enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay studies were performed to delineate antiproliferative signaling pathways.
RESULTS. The atypical BP-NET, NCI-H720, was most sensitive to the sst5 analog
BIM23206 (half-maximal concentration, 2.4 pM) and demonstrated similar sensitivity to lanreotide and the sst2 analog BIM23120. The typical BP-NET, NCI-H727,
was most sensitive to BIM23120 (0.7 nM) and to the pan-somatostatin receptor
analog (BIM23A779). The GI-NET, KRJ-I, was most sensitive to sst2,5 analogs lanreotide (1 nM) and BIM23244 (7.4 nM). Lanreotide activated extracellular signal
regulated kinase-1/2 phosphorylation and p21WAF1/CIP1 transcription, but inhibited Ki-67 transcription. NCI-H720 was most sensitive to the sst2,5- and D2-selective compound BIM23A761 (4.2 nM), as was NCI-H727 (5.5 nM). KRJ-I did not
respond to any chimeric analog. BIM23A761 activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase
signaling and caused inhibition of Ki-67 transcription. P21WAF1/CIP1 transcription
was activated only in NCI-H727 cells.

CONCLUSIONS. The different responses of each individual cell line suggested that
NETs from different locations arising from different neuroendocrine cells may
require cell-specific antiproliferative agents based on the unique receptor profile
of individual lesions. Cancer 2008;113:690–700.  2008 American Cancer Society.

euroendocrine tumors (NETs)—previously considered ‘‘carcinoids’’—account for 0.66% of all malignancies; however, it is
noteworthy that the incidence has increased 3% to 10% per year
over the last 30 years.1,2 Although they predominantly occur in the
gastrointestinal tract (67.5%), a substantial percentage is found in
the bronchopulmonary system (25.3%).3 A paucity are evident in the
ovaries (1.01%), testes (0.07%), or thymus (0.38%), but they can
occur in any location that contains cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system.1 In rare circumstances (<10%), such tumors may pres-

ent as metastatic disease from an unknown primary
site.4 Of note is the high proportion (22.4%) of associated noncarcinoid malignancies that occur concurrently with NETs, especially of the small bowel.1
It is also noteworthy that there has been no
improvement in survival in the last 3 decades (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database
1973-2004),3,5 and to our knowledge there exists no
effective, safe, and targeted therapy for the disease.
The overall 5-year survival rate for gastrointestinal
NETs is 67.2%,5 and for bronchopulmonary NETs it is
50% to 88%,3 with a worse prognosis for atypical
lesions that are defined by a higher mitotic count (210 mitoses per square millimeter in 10 high-power
fields) and/or the presence of necrosis.6 Given the
increasing incidence of these lesions and the failure
to improve outcome, there is a substantial need to
identify more effective treatment modalities.1,5
Although the only curative therapy for NETs is
surgery, >85% of NETs are metastatic at diagnosis,
hence ab initio, <15% of patients have any likelihood
of having curative intervention.7 Currently available
therapy (biotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical resection,
and debulking) focuses on disease stabilization and
symptom control. Tumor regression is very rare and
estimated at 2% to 5%.7 The majority of contemporary therapy for NET disease is based on empiric data
derived from experience with adenocarcinomas; to
our knowledge few adequately powered prospective
studies exist, and it is unclear at a cellular and molecular level how the individual NETs studied differ
from each other.5
The most thoroughly investigated group of agents
are the long-acting somatostatin analogs, which
include lanreotide and octreotide. These compounds,
which have been assessed in phase 3 clinical studies,8
are effective in controlling most symptoms associated
with the hypersecretory activity of NET cells. Lanreotide is effective in the treatment of active postoperative
acromegaly,9 but the antiproliferative role of both lanreotide and octreotide in gastrointestinal and bronchopulmonary NETs is limited. Direct mechanisms of
somatostatin analog action require the activation of 5
receptors (sst1-5), belonging to the family of G-protein
coupled receptors, and the induction of cell cycle
arrest or apoptosis, mainly through the regulation of
phosphotyrosine phosphatase and mitogen-activated
protein kinase activities.10 The indirect mechanisms
involve inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and secretion
of factors that are required for tumor growth.
Dopamine regulates secretion and gene expression mediated by D2 receptors coupled to Gai proteins, with a resultant inhibition of adenylyl cyclase,

tion, and suppression of activated phosphokinase
A.11 Recently, chimeric molecules that possess
potent, selective agonist activity for both somatostatin and dopamine receptors have been synthesized.
These compounds have been shown to be more
effective in suppressing growth hormone and prolactin secretion from cultured human growth hormone–
secreting pituitary adenomas than either octreotide
or mono-receptor ligands alone.11-13 To our knowledge these agents have not been evaluated against
human NETs of the gastrointestinal and bronchopulmonary system.
We analyzed the effects of 12 novel somatostatin
analogs and somatostatin/dopamine chimeric compounds (Table 1) on 3 human NET (carcinoid) cell
lines (an atypical bronchopulmonary NET: NCIH720; a bronchial NET: NCI-H727; and a small intestinal NET: KRJ-I14,15) to investigate whether different
NETs require cell-specific antiproliferative agents
based on the unique receptor profile of individual
lesions. In addition, we examined the antiproliferative signaling mechanisms of somatostatin- and dopamine-mediated cell inhibition in each NET type.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Culture Conditions
KRJ-I and NCI-H720 cells were cultured as floating
aggregates at 378C with 5% carbon dioxide. KRJ-I
cells were kept in Ham F12 medium (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, Mo), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin
(100 mg/mL).15-17 For NCI-H720, a 1:1 solution of Ham
F12 and Dulbecco minimal essential medium was
supplemented with final concentrations of FBS (5%),

were kept at 378C in RPMI-1640 medium containing
final concentrations of FBS (10%), L-glutamine (2
mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), and glucose (2.5 g/
L).14 For further processing, NCI-H727 cells were
washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before
trypsin–ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid was applied.

Proliferation Studies
After being spun for 5 minutes at 1500 3 g, the pellets of the 3 cell lines were resuspended in each medium to a concentration of 5 3 105 cells/mL and
seeded in 96-well plates at 100 mL with 5 3 104 cells/
well (2 plates used per experimental condition). Lane
1 and 2 contained negative (medium only) and positive (pure cell suspension) controls.17 The BioMeasure
(BIM) compounds were provided by IPSEN (Milford,
Mass). Drugs were diluted in PBS and applied every
24 hours in final concentrations from 10212 to 1026.
Agent Profiles
The agent profiles and somatostatin and dopamine
receptor subtype specificities (half-maximal concentration [IC50]) of each of the tested compounds are provided in Table 1. All compounds are stable in vitro and
degradation is not an issue (unpublished data).
MTT Assay
After 72 hours of incubation (378C; 5% carbon dioxide) with each compound, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was

added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL per well
followed by additional incubation for 3 hours.17,18 The
reaction was stopped, and the formazan dye was solubilized by adding an equal volume (100 mL) of acidisopropanol (0.01 N HCl in isopropanol). The optical
density was read at 595 nanometers (nm) using a
microplate reader (Bio-Rad 3500, Richmond, Calif).16,17

Enzyme-Linked Immunoadsorbent Assay (CASE) Assay
The effects of somatostatin analogs, BIM23926 (sst1),
BIM23120 (sst2), BIM23023, BIM23244 (both sst2,5),
and BIM23206 (sst5), were measured on the extracellular signal regulated kinase-1 (ERK1/2) signaling
pathway as described.19 In separate studies, the
effects of lanreotide on ERK1/2 signaling pathway
and BIM23A761 on ERK/protein kinase B (AKT)/cJun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor jB
(NFkB) signaling pathways were evaluated.19 Cells
were stimulated with IC50 concentrations (from proliferation studies, Table 2) for 30 minutes. To assess
the specificity of ERK pathway activation, cells were
preincubated with PD98059 (30 mM) (an inhibitor of
ERK1/2 phosphorylation) for 10 minutes before addition of lanreotide and BIM23A761. ERK, AKT, JNK
and NFkB phosphorylation were measured using an
enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA)
(CASE, SuperArray, Hamburg, Germany) as per the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, stimulated cells were
fixed (4% formaldehyde), and stained with primary
antibodies against either the nonphosphorylated or
phosphorylated forms of each protein (60 minutes,
room temperature [RT]). After washing and secondary antibody application (60 minutes, RT), cells were
incubated with color developer (10 minutes, RT), and
plates were read at 450 nm. Thereafter, protein was

D2, D4, and D5 receptors were present in NCI-H727 cells (E and F), whereas inhibitory D2 and D4 receptors were identified in NCI-H720 (G). D5 receptors were

assayed in each well (protein development reading at
595 nm). Results were calculated as antibody reading
(at 450 nm)/protein concentration (measured at 595
nm) and normalized to unstimulated cells. Phosphorylated signal was compared with total nonphosphorylated signal.

Real-Time PCR
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from 2 3 106
NCI-H70, NCI-H727, and KRJ-I cells in log phase
growth (n 5 3) or from normal brain (n 5 3) (TRIZOL,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif), and cleaned (Qiagen
RNeasy kit and DNeasy Tissue kit; Qiagen Inc., Germantown, Md) to minimize contaminating genomic
DNA. RNA (2 mg) was converted to cDNA (High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit; Applied Biosystems).17,20,21
Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed using Assays-onDemand products and the ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System according to the manufacturer’s suggestions.17,20,21 Cycling was performed under standard
conditions (TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix Protocol), and data were normalized using geNorm22 and
expression of the novel house-keeping genes, ALG9,
TFCP2, and ZNF410.17,21
Receptor Profile
Levels of sst1-5 and D1-5 were measured in NCI-H720,
NCI-H727, and KRJ-I cell lines. Normal brain was
used as a control. Receptor probes were used to
quantify the presence of somatostatin and dopamine

receptors in each cell line. Transcript levels of <0.1
normalized geNorm were considered absent.

Cell Cycle Markers
Ki-67 and p21WAF1/CIP1 transcripts were measured in
response to lanreotide and BIM23A761. NCI-H720,
NCI-H727, and KRJ-I cells were stimulated with IC50
concentrations of lanreotide and BIM23A761, respectively. Cells were cultured for 24 hours before RNA
extraction. RNA was isolated using the standard PCR
protocol.17,20,21
Statistical Evaluation
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 4
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif). Sigmoidal
dose responses and nonlinear regression analyses
were calculated to identify half-maximal concentrations (IC50) for each drug. Alterations in signal transduction and transcriptional activation were assessed
using 2-tailed Student t test for paired data.

RESULTS
Receptor Profile by PCR
Analysis of somatostatin and dopamine receptor levels
using real-time PCR in each cell line demonstrated a
different expression profile for each cell line.
NCI-H720
This cell line was derived from an ‘‘atypical’’ bronchopulmonary NET.14 It is specific for somatostatin

receptors 2 and 5 as well as the dopamine receptors
2 and 4 (Fig. 1). The somatostatin/dopamine receptor profile of NCI-H720 is thus designated as sst2,5/
D2,4.

NCI-H727
NCI-H727 is a cell line derived from a ‘‘typical’’ bronchial NET.14 It is positive for sst1-3,5 in addition to
D1,2,5. Very low levels of D4 (<0.1 normalized geNorm) were also identified (Fig. 1). The receptor profile of NCI-H727 is therefore sst1,2,3,5/D1,2,5.
KRJ-I
KRJ-I is derived from a ‘‘typical’’ small intestinal
NET.15 It is positive for sst1-3,5 as well as low levels of
D5 ( 5 0.1 normalized geNorm) (Fig. 1). The receptor
profile of KRJ-I is sst1,2,3,5/D5.
Antiproliferative Effects of Somatostatin and
Somatostatin/Dopamine Chimeras
NCI-H720
Proliferation of this cell line is inhibited by the sst5
agonist, BIM23206 (IC50 5 2.4pM), with a comparable sensitivity to lanreotide (sst2,5 agonist, 6.5 pM)
and the sst2 agonist, BIM23120 (IC50 5 41 pM) (Table 2). NCI-H720 cells were less responsive to the
sst2,5 agonist, BIM23244 (IC50 5 0.11 nM) and did
not significantly respond to the sst1 agonist,
BIM23926. These results are consistent with the somatostatin receptor profile of the NCI-H720 cells
(Figs. 1A, 1B, and 1D) and with ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by these somatostatin analogs (Table
2). Of the 2 pan-somatostatin receptor agonists
tested, NCI-H720 cells were most sensitive to
BIM23A719 (pan-somatostatin receptor agonist 1,
IC50 5 6.2 nM).
Cell proliferation was also inhibited by the dopamine agonist, BIM53061 (IC50 5 0.23 nM) and both
BIM23A760 (sst/da agonist 2, IC50 5 18.3 nM) and
BIM23A761 (sst/da agonist 3, IC50 5 4.2 nM).
NCI-H727
The typical BP-NET was most sensitive to the sst2
agonist, BIM23120 (IC50 5 0.7 nM) and to the pansomatostatin agonist 2, BIM23A779 (IC50 5 1.9 pM)
(Table 2). Neither sst1, sst2,5, nor any of the sst2, 5
agonists caused inhibition of proliferation despite
expression of transcripts for these receptors (Figs. 1A,
1B, and 1D). These results are consistent with the absence of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by these agents
(Table 2).
Cell proliferation was also inhibited by the sst2,5- and
D2-selective compound BIM23A761 (IC50 5 5.5 nM).

KRJ-I
KRJ-I was most sensitive to lanreotide (IC50 5 1 nM),
BIM23244 (sst2,5 agonist, IC50 5 7.4 nM), and BIM
23926 (sst1 agonist, IC50 5 8.5 nM), but was not responsive to either a pure sst2 (BIM23120) or sst5
(BIM23206) agonist (Table 2). The cell proliferation
inhibitory effects were consistent with ERK1/2 phosphorylation by these compounds; neither BIM23120
nor BIM23206 induced phosphorylation (Table 2).
KRJ-I cells were sensitive to both pan-somatostatin
receptor agonists, but were most sensitive to the type
1 agent (BIM23A719).
KRJ-I cell proliferation could not be effectively
inhibited by either the dopamine agonists (IC50 5 0.7
mM) or the sst/da agonist chimeras, which reflects the
absence of significant transcripts for the inhibitory
dopamine receptor (type 2) on this cell line (Fig. 1F).
Effects of Lanreotide and BIM23A761 on
Cell Signaling Pathways
NCI-H720
Lanreotide activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (182  35%, P\0.01 vs control) through phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which
could be inhibited (65  17, P \.01 vs lanreotide) by
the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059 (Fig.
2A). This is consistent with the inhibitory effects of
lanreotide on NCI-H720 cell proliferation. When cells
were stimulated with the type 3 sst/da chimera,
BIM23A761, ERK was not phosphorylated. In contrast, the JNK pathway was activated by this compound; phosphorylated JNK levels were elevated
(61  4%, P \.05 vs control) (Fig. 3A). Neither NFkB
nor AKT were significantly altered by BIM23A761.
NCI-H727
Lanreotide had no effect on ERK phosphorylation
(Fig. 2B), which is consistent with the observation
that proliferation could not be inhibited (Table 2).
The BIM23A761 sst/da chimera was associated, as in
NCI-H720 cells, with significant activation of JNK
phosphorylation (475  27%, P \ .01 vs control; Fig.
3B). Although ERK1/2 signaling was inhibited
(17  3, P \ .05 vs control), neither the NFkB nor
AKT signaling pathways were significantly activated.
KRJ-I
Lanreotide activated ERK1/2 signaling by 25%  8%
(P 5 .05 vs control), which could be inhibited by the
MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (Fig. 2C). BIM23A761 did
not significantly alter phosphorylation of any of the
signaling pathways, which was consistent with the
lack of any demonstrable effect of this sst/da chimera on KRJ-I cell proliferation (Table 2).

Effects of Lanreotide and BIM23A761 on Downstream
Transcriptional Targets
NCI-H720
Real-time PCR analysis of cells incubated with lanreotide for 24 hours demonstrated that Ki-67 transcript levels were significantly decreased (45%  7%)
compared with unstimulated cells (P \.01) (Fig. 4A).
This is consistent with the observation that lanreotide inhibits NCI-H720 proliferation. The effect was
specific, because it could be inhibited by PD98059
(6%  2%, P \ .05 vs lanreotide alone). Lanreotide
significantly increased p21WAF1/CIP1 transcript levels
compared with unstimulated cells (140%  27%, P \
.01 vs control), and this increase was reversible by
PD98059 (P \ .05 vs lanreotide alone) (Fig. 4D).
These results are consistent with the antiproliferative
effects of this compound on NCI-H720.
Real-time PCR analysis of BIM23A761-stimulated
cells demonstrated that Ki-67 transcript levels were
decreased 99%  17% (P \ .01 vs controls) (Fig. 5A),
confirming that this compound inhibited NCI-H720
cell proliferation. In addition, and in contrast to
the effects of lanreotide in these cells, p21WAF1/CIP1
transcript levels were significantly decreased (74% 
27%, P < .05 vs control).
NCI-H727
Real-Time PCR analysis of the effect of lanreotide on
Ki-67 demonstrated that this was not significantly

decreased compared with control cells (Fig. 4A), and
p21WAF1/CIP1 transcripts were not significantly upregulated (Fig. 4E), results consistent with the absence of an inhibitory effect of lanreotide on NCIH727 proliferation.
PCR assessment of BIM23A761 demonstrated
significant (P \ .01) down-regulation of Ki-67 transcript levels (80%  12% change vs control) (Fig. 5B),
whereas p21WAF1/CIP1 transcripts were elevated
(1082%  97%, P \.01 vs control).

KRJ-I
Real-time PCR measurements of Ki-67 transcript
levels demonstrated that lanreotide down-regulated
Ki-67 (73%  12%; P \ .01 vs control) (Fig. 4C), and
this was inhibited by PD98059 (P \ .05 vs lanreotide
alone). Transcripts for p21WAF1/CIP1 were significantly
elevated (175%  21%, P \ .01 vs control) (Fig. 4F),
results consistent with the antiproliferative effects of
this compound on KRJ-I.
In BIM23A761-treated KRJ-I cells, neither Ki-67
nor p21WAF1/CIP1 transcript levels were significantly
decreased (Fig. 5C and 5F), consistent with observations that BIM23A761 did not inhibit KRJ-I cell proliferation.

This study reveals that individual lung and gastrointestinal NET cell lines exhibit substantially different

receptor expressions for somatostatin and dopamine
receptors, which are differently coupled to the ERK
and JNK signaling pathways. In addition, somatostatin analogs and somatostatin/dopamine chimeric
compounds are potent inhibitors of NET cell proliferation, and cell lines from the same organ (lung,
typical vs atypical NET) were differently sensitive to
receptor targeting. These molecular observations
confirm the need to individualize therapeutic strategies based upon analysis of the receptor profile of a
specific lesion as opposed to a global strategy based
purely on a histopathological characterization or
classification. The differences in ERK signaling activation to specific somatostatin analogs suggest that
defining the receptor profile alone may not be sufficient to predict NET responsiveness to these analogs.
This is highlighted by the results with lanreotide,
BIM23244, and BIM23023, which are all predicted to
inhibit cell function through activation of sst2,5. In
the current study, lanreotide was the most effective
inhibitor in NCI-H720 and KRJ-I cells. In contrast,
and despite expression of sst2,5, none of these compounds inhibited NCI-H727 cell proliferation. The
absence of an effect in this cell line may suggest either abnormal receptor expression (cell membrane/
protein level), as has been noted in acromegalic
tumors,23 or receptor coupling resulting in nonfunc-

tional and divergent signaling pathways, as noted in
rat somatotrophs.24 Because ERK1/2 phosphorylation
studies demonstrated no responses to sst2,5 ligands
in NCI-H727 cells, but did demonstrate an effect in
NCI-H720 and KRJ-I cells, we conclude that effective
receptor signaling may be a prerequisite for appropriate inhibition of NET proliferation.
An examination of pan-somatostatin receptor
agonists demonstrated that the type 1 (BIM23A719)
was most effective in NCI-H720 and KRJ-I cells (IC50
in NCI-H720 5 6.2 nM and IC50 in KRJ-I 5 0.53 nM),
whereas the type 2 agonist (BIM23A779) was most
effective in NCI-H727 cells (IC50 NCI H727 5 1.9
pM). Of note is the finding that the pan-somatostatin
receptor agents were not as effective as individualized somatostatin agonists in the atypical bronchopulmonary NET (NCI-H720), as in the ‘‘typical’’
bronchopulmonary NET. The sensitivity of the latter
to a pan-somatostatin compound conforms to a previous study demonstrating that SOM230 was more
effective than octreotide in inhibiting NCI-H727 proliferation.25 This also confirms our observation that
NCI-H727 cells are not effectively inhibited by an
sst2,5 compound, despite expressing these receptors.25,26

proliferative effects are not well characterized, particularly on lung and gastrointestinal NETs. Targeting
D2, which is coupled to Gai and through coupling to
phosphodiesterase activity reduces intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate,27 is associated with
inhibition of MAPK signaling.28 Activation of inhibitory D2 receptors would therefore be predicted to inhibit cell proliferation. In the current study, NCIH720 cells that express the inhibitory dopamine
receptors (D2,4R) exhibit a decrease in cell proliferation when exposed to BIM53061 (IC50 5 21 nM).
This compound also inhibits KRJ-I (mM concentrations) but not NCI-H727 cell proliferation. These differences could reflect expression of the stimulatory
D1,5 receptors in these cell lines, and suggests that a
D2 agonist would most likely be ineffective in neoplastic neuroendocrine cells expressing multiple dopamine receptor subtypes.
Somatostatin/dopamine chimeras target multiple
receptor complexes to effect growth inhibition.13 Proliferation of NCI-H720 was inhibited by both sst/da
agonists 2 and 3 (IC50: 4.2-18 nM). These agents,
however, were less effective (<100-fold) than targeting specific somatostatin receptors alone, eg, sst5 or
the pan-somatostatin receptor agonist 1 on NCIH720 cells. Targeting the dopamine in addition to somatostatin receptors is not therefore additionally
inhibitory in this cell line. In NCI-H727 cells, sst/da
agonist 3 was an effective inhibitor of proliferation.
The KRJ-I cell line was not effectively inhibited by
any of the sst/da compounds.
Having determined that NET cells lines were differentially sensitive to somatostatin analogs and sst/
da chimeras, we next evaluated the mechanisms (signaling pathways, downstream transcriptional targets)
by which 2 agents, lanreotide (sst2,5) and BIM23A761
(sst/da agonist 3), inhibited cell proliferation. These
agents were chosen because they were both potent
(lanreotide: 6.5 pM NCI-H720 and 1 nM KRJ-I;
BIM23A761: 4.2 nM NCI-H720 and 5.5 nM NCIH727) and they significantly inhibited only 2 (lanreotide: H720 and KRJ-I; BIM23A761: NCI-H720 and

FIGURE 6. Somatostatin and sst/da chimera receptor signaling pathways in
NET cell lines are shown. Somatostatin receptor activation (largely via sst2)
results in MEK activation and downstream phosphorylation of ERK (A). Activated
ERK phosphorylates and activates the cdk inhibitor P27KIP1 and up-regulates
P21WAF1/CIP1, while inhibiting transcription of the cyclin, Ki-67. The combination
of cdk inhibitor up-regulation and a decrease in Ki-67 results in growth arrest.

NCI-H727) of the 3 cell lines; 1 cell line therefore
could be used as a negative control.
Lanreotide stimulated ERK1/2 activity in
both NCI-H720 and KRJ-I cells, but not in NCI-H727
cells. This resulted in a decrease in transcripts for
Ki-67 and an elevation of the cell cycle inhibitor,
p21WAF1/CIP1. Preincubation with the MEK inhibitor,
PD98059, decreased these lanreotide-mediated
alterations in p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. In studies in
Chinese hamster epithelial ovary CHO-K1cells, lanreotide-stimulated ERK activity led to accumulation
of phosphorylated P27Kip1, inhibition of cyclinE-cdk2
kinase activity, accumulation of hypophosphorylated
p105Rb, and cell cycle arrest.29,30 Over-expression
of P21WAF1/CIP1, a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor, leads to G1 and G2 or S-phase arrest.31 Our
findings indicate that the inhibitory effects of lanreotide on H720 and KRJ-I are associated with cell
cycle arrest, at least via p21WAF1/CIP1 transcriptional
up-regulation.
In NCI-H720, BIM23A761 did not phosphorylate
ERK1/2, AKT, or NFkB but activated JNK phosphorylation. JNK was also phosphorylated in BIM23A761treated NCI-H727 cells, but phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 was inhibited. Although BIM23A761 caused a
decrease in transcripts for Ki-67 in both cell lines, an
elevation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 was
only detected in NCI-H727 cells. In contrast, expression of this cdk inhibitor was significantly decreased
in NCI-H720 cells. This seemingly discrepant observation raises the issue of the precise role of JNK signaling in apoptosis, because JNK has been reported
to function as both a pro- and antiapoptotic agent.32
JNK induces phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63, a site
important for c-Jun–dependent transcriptional activity,33 and the combination of c-Jun activation and
p21WAF1/CIP1 suppression stimulates P53-dependant
apoptosis.31 Our finding of suppressed levels of
P21WAF1/CIP1 in NCI-H720 cells is consistent with a
role for BIM23A761 in inhibiting cell proliferation via
a P53-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, BIM23A761mediated growth inhibition in NCI-H727 cells,
similar to lanreotide in NCI-H720 and KRJ-I cells, is
associated with P21WAF1/CIP1-mediated cell cycle inhibition through the retinoblastoma pathway.29,30 It
is thus likely that individual NETs will not share
completely similar transduction mechanisms for proliferative regulation, and that specific assessments
will be necessary to identify and predict the most efficacious therapeutic agent.
Synthetic derivatives of somatostatin, such as
octreotide, are in common clinical use as therapy for
acromegaly and gastroenteropancreatic tumors.34
Although effective in the inhibition of the secretion

699

of bioactive products and the amelioration of symptomatology,35 they have been disappointing as antiproliferative agents in vivo.7 The reasons for this are
not known, but it indicates that secretory regulation
of NET cells is an intrinsic property, whereas the proliferative drive may comprise many agents (angiogenic factors, growth factors) and has a substantial
extrinsic basis, likely from the tumor micro-milieu.
We have used an in vitro model to study the
effects of selective somatostatin and dopamine compounds on NET cells. With the caveat that our studies cannot measure the effects of these compounds
on cells, eg, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the
NET microenvironment that regulate NET proliferation and secretion,5,36,37 we demonstrate that targeting specific receptor subtypes on tumor cells, with
selective somatostatin agonists, may be more advantageous in ‘‘atypical’’ bronchopulmonary NETs than
a single generic compound. In contrast, bronchopulmonary NETs and gastrointestinal NETs with an
extensive somatostatin receptor expression profile
may be more responsive to a pan-somatostatin analog.25 Because some NETs express somatostatin and
D2 receptors, it is has been suggested that sst/da chimeric compounds may prove to be valuable in the
management of NETs that exhibit both receptor profiles.38 Our results support this observation, because
somatostatin/dopamine chimeric compounds are as
effective as pan-somatostatin analogs in inhibiting
NET cell proliferation. They do, however, appear to
be less effective than single receptor targeted somatostatin agonist therapy for ‘‘atypical’’ bronchopulmonary NETs.
In conclusion, individual (site and cell specific)
NETs respond differently to specific somatostatin
analogs and sst/da chimeric compounds, depending
on the somatostatin and dopamine receptor profile
coupling to signaling pathways. Antiproliferative
effects are because of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and
JNK signaling and activation of cdk inhibitors with a
decrease in Ki-67 (Fig. 6). If a therapeutic strategy
that embraces receptor targeting is used for NETs, it
will require prior delineation of the specific receptor
profile of the tumor and the selection of ‘‘receptortailored’’ pharmacotherapy to optimize effective
treatment.
