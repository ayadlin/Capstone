ABSTRACT
Emerging evidence has suggested that leptin, an adipokine related to energy
homeostasis, plays a role in cancer growth and metastasis. However, its impact on
pancreatic cancer is rarely studied. In this study, we found that leptin’s functional
receptor Ob-Rb was expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Treatment with leptin
enhanced the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells but did not affect the
proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells. Leptin up-regulated the expression
of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
The overexpression of leptin was shown to significantly promote tumor growth and
lymph node metastasis in a subcutaneous model and an orthotopic model of human
pancreatic cancer, respectively. Furthermore, in human pancreatic cancer tissues, the
expression of Ob-Rb was positively correlated with the MMP-13 level. The increased
expression of either Ob-Rb or MMP-13 was significantly associated with lymph node
metastasis and tended to be associated with the TNM stage in patients with pancreatic
cancer. Our findings suggest that leptin enhances the invasion of pancreatic cancer
through the increase in MMP-13 production, and targeting the leptin/MMP-13 axis
could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

has also been associated with increased lymph node (LN)
metastasis in patients with resected pancreatic cancer [7].
Moreover, both obesity and diabetes have been associated
with decreased survival among pancreatic cancer
patients [7, 8]. However, the mechanisms underlying
their influence on pancreatic cancer development and
progression remain poorly understood. Obesity-induced
alterations in the adipocytokine milieu have been linked
to several systemic diseases [9]. Leptin is one of the
most studied adipocytokines, and its peripheral level has
been demonstrated to be substantially increased in obese
humans [10, 11], as well as in patients with diabetes [12].
As an important adipocyte-derived peptide hormone,
leptin functions in regulating food intake and energy
metabolism [13]. It is also produced by non-adipose

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant
neoplasms among all gastrointestinal cancers, with a
5-year survival rate below 6% and a median survival
period of less than 6 months [1, 2]. In the past decades,
none of the novel approaches have added meaningful
clinical or survival benefits in this patient population [3].
The lack of effective therapy is partly due to the aggressive
tumor biology, but also reflects the current insufficient
understanding of the mechanisms of pancreatic cancer
growth and dissemination.
Etiological studies have provided evidence
supporting that obesity and diabetes are independent risk
factors for developing pancreatic cancer [4-6]. Obesity

tissues [14], and may function in the modulation other
biological processes, such as angiogenesis, hematopoiesis,
reproduction, and bone formation [15-17]. Importantly,
emerging evidence suggests that leptin plays an important
role in cancer proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [18].
Given that obesity and diabetes have been associated with
the development of numerous cancers [19, 20], leptin may
act as a link between metabolic disorders and cancer.
The role of leptin signaling in cancer has been
explored in various studies. Leptin exerts its biological
activity through its specific receptor (Ob-R), which
belongs to the class I cytokine receptor family [21].
Although there are at least six receptor isoforms that
have been identified, only the full long form of the
leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) contains the intracellular motifs
necessary for the initiation of intracellular leptin signaling
[21]. Ob-Rb was detected in diverse cell lines derived from
various cancers, such as liver cancer [22], ovarian cancer
[23], colorectal cancer [24], and cholangiocarcinoma
[25]. Additionally, treatment with leptin was shown to
significantly stimulate the proliferation and/or invasion of
malignant cells in vitro [22-26]. Moreover, the growth of
colon tumors was substantially retarded in leptin-deficient
(ob/ob) or leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice [27],
suggesting an important role for leptin signaling in tumor
regulation in vivo.
A recent study reported that the leptin receptor was
detected in pancreatic cancer cells, and hypoxia inducible
factor (HIF)-1α could directly regulate its expression [28].
However, the biological consequences and molecular
mechanisms underlying the activation of the leptin
signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cells have not
been investigated in detail. In this study, we investigated
the role of leptin signaling in pancreatic cancer cells
through in vitro and in vivo studies. More importantly,
we assessed the relationship between Ob-Rb and the
clinicopathological characteristics of pancreatic cancer.

At the protein level, Ob-Rb was detected via western
blotting using the antibody that recognizes only the long
form of the leptin receptor (Figure 1B). These results
confirmed that Ob-Rb, a functional receptor responsible
for intracellular signal transduction [21], is present in
pancreatic cells.
We next investigated the influence of leptin on the
proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells. Serumstarved PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells were treated with 100
ng/ml of recombinant human leptin. At this concentration,
leptin has been reported to significantly stimulate the
growth of various cancer cells [22, 23, 25, 29]. However,
as shown in Figure 1C, the treatment with leptin had no
influence on the proliferation of either the PANC-1 or
AsPC-1 cells.
As both the migration and invasion of tumor cells
contribute to the metastasis of pancreatic cancer [30],
we next addressed whether leptin could influence the
migration and invasion potential of human pancreatic
cancer cells. Using a scratch assay, the numbers of both
the PANC-1 (P < 0.01) and AsPC-1 cells (P < 0.01) that
migrated to the scratched area were greater in the cells
treated with leptin than in those without leptin treatment
(Figure 1D). Additionally, the leptin significantly
accelerated the invasion of the pancreatic cancer cells
through a Matrigel-reconstituted basement membrane
matrix towards the bottom chamber (Figure 1E). Crystalviolet staining of the invaded cells exhibited significant
invasions of both the PANC-1 (P < 0.01) and the AsPC-1
cells (P < 0.01) in response to the leptin treatment (Figure
1F). Collectively, our data suggest that leptin can promote
the migration and invasion of human pancreatic cancer
cells but has no effect on cell proliferation.

Leptin activates the JAK2/STAT3 signaling
pathway in the enhancement of the migration and
invasion of pancreatic cancer cells

RESULTS

The intracellular signaling of leptin is considered
to be primarily transmitted through the JAK/STAT
pathway [31]. Therefore, we examined whether the JAK/
STAT signal pathway is also involved in leptin’s action
in pancreatic cancer cells. Total protein lysates of PANC1 cells treated with leptin for various time periods were
collected to detect the phosphorylation level of STAT3. As
shown in Figure 2A, leptin stimulated the phosphorylation
of STAT3 in a time-dependent manner. The phosphorylated
STAT3 (pSTAT3) was increased significantly during the
first 30 min and was maintained for at least 24 h after the
treatment (Figure 2A).
We then tested the effect of the JAK2 inhibitor
AG490 on the leptin-induced enhancement of the
migration and invasion of the pancreatic cancer cells.
The treatment of the cells with AG490 significantly
decreased the intracellular level of pSTAT3 stimulated

Leptin promotes the invasion and migration, but
not the proliferation, of pancreatic cancer cells in
vitro
Because leptin exerts its biological effects via
binding to specific receptors [21], we first determined
whether leptin receptors (Ob-Rs) existed in the human
pancreatic cancer cells PANC-1 and AsPC-1. The ObRs mRNA was measured via reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR) using specific primers targeting the total
isoforms (Ob-Rt) and the full long isoform (Ob-Rb) of
the leptin receptor. As shown in Figure 1A, the predicted
PCR products of Ob-Rt (273 bp) and Ob-Rb (1,071 bp)
were observed in both the PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells.

phosphorylation significantly attenuated the enhancement
of the migration (Figure 2C) and invasion (Figure 2D)
induced by leptin in both the PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells.
These data suggest the involvement of the JAK2/STAT3
pathway in the leptin-induced enhancement of migration
and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells.

involved in the pancreatic cancer cell invasion triggered
by leptin, we analyzed the expression change of MMP2, MMP-7, MMP-9 and MMP-13 before and after leptin
treatment. As shown in Figure 3A, the treatment with
leptin resulted in a significant increase in the MMP13 mRNA expression in both the PANC-1 and AsPC-1
cells but did not change the mRNA levels of MMP-2,
MMP-7 or MMP-9. At the protein level, there was also
significantly increased expression of MMP-13 in response
to the leptin treatment (Figure 3B). Furthermore, collagen
zymography demonstrated a similar enhancement of the
MMP-13 enzyme activity in the supernatants of the leptintreated cells (Figure 3C). To test whether the activation
of JAK2/STAT3 contributed to the upregulation of MMP13, we applied the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 in the study.
As shown in Figure 3B to 3D, blocking the JAK2/STAT3
pathway using AG490 significantly attenuated the leptininduced enhancement of the MMP-13 expression and
activity, suggesting that MMP13 is regulated by JAK2/
STAT3 after leptin stimulation.

Leptin signaling has been reported to regulate the
production of various MMPs, including MMP-2 [32,
33], MMP-7 [34], MMP-9 [33], and MMP-13 [35].
MMPs play an important role in tumor metastasis due
to their ability to degrade the extracellular matrix [36].

Although MMP-13 has been suggested to be
linked to the metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer via
immunohistochemistry analysis and cDNA array assay
[37, 38], this has never been proven experimentally. To
investigate whether MMP-13 can increase the mobility of
pancreatic cancer cells in vitro, we overexpressed MMP13 in PANC-1 cells (PANC-1-MMP13) using lentiviral
vectors (Figure 3E). The overexpression of MMP-13
significantly promoted the invasion of the PANC-1 cells
but did not affect their migration potential (Figure 3F). We
further used the MMP-13 inhibitor CL82198 to confirm
that leptin’s action on the pancreatic cancer cells was
mediated by MMP-13. As shown in Figure 3G and 3H,
CL82198 significantly antagonized the increased invasion,
but not the migration, induced by leptin in both the PANC1 and AsPC-1 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that
MMP-13 may serve as a downstream effector of the leptin

-JAK2/STAT3 cascade responsible for pancreatic cancer
cell invasion.

Leptin promotes the growth and metastasis of
pancreatic cancer in vivo
To investigate the in vivo impact of leptin on
pancreatic cancer, we established a PANC-1 pancreatic
cancer cellline stably overexpressing leptin (PANC-1Leptin). Western blot analyses demonstrated the increased
concentration of leptin in both the cell lysates and
supernatants of the cultured PANC-1-Leptin cells (Figure
4A), confirming the exogenous expression and secretion
of leptin in the PANC-1-Leptin cells. Meanwhile, the
overexpression of leptin was coupled with the upregulation
of MMP-13 (Figure 4A), and it significantly enhanced the
cell migration and invasion in vitro (Supplementary Figure

euthanized at 53 days post-inoculation, and we did
not find any significant differences in the orthotopic
tumor weights between the groups (Figure 4G and
4H). However, interestingly, more mice bearing leptinoverexpressing tumors (8 out of 10) developed celiac
lymph node metastases compared to the control mice
(3 out of 10; Figure 4I). And the average number of
metastatic lymph nodes in the leptin-overexpressing
mice was also significantly greater than in the control
mice (Figure 4J and 4K). However, we did not observe
metastasis to the liver, lung, or spleen in either group. In
addition, we detected increased expression of MMP-13 in
the metastatic tumors overexpressing leptin (Figure 4L),

S1). The PANC-1-Leptin and the control PANC-1-Lv cells
were then inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice, and
the tumor growth was monitored once per week. The
leptin-overexpressing xenografts had a significantly faster
growth rate than the controls (Figure 4B). At the time of
euthanasia, the mean volume of the leptin-overexpressing
tumors was significantly larger than that of the tumors
in the control group (Figure 4C and 4D). Similar to the
tumor volume, the tumor weight was increased by 81.6%
in the leptin-overexpressing tumors (Figure 4E). In both
the leptin-overexpressing cells (Figure 4A) and tumors
(Figure 5F), MMP-13 was consistently upregulated.

in the patients with lymph node metastasis than in those
without lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001, Figure 5B &
Table 1), and it tended to be stronger in the patients with
advanced-stage pancreatic cancer than in those with the
early stages of the disease (P = 0.09, Table 1). Moreover,
as shown in Figure 3C, the Ob-Rb levels were significantly
correlated with the MMP-13 levels in the pancreatic
cancer tissues (r = 0.59, P < 0.001). Consistently, we also
found the association of MMP-13 expression with lymph
node metastasis and the pathological stage (Figure 5D &

axis in pancreatic cancer metastasis.

DISCUSSION

receptor antagonist may become a new strategy for the
treatment for pancreatic cancer.
Leptin has been reported to have different effects
on cancer cell proliferation. In most cancers, such as
breast, prostate, lung and colorectal cancer, leptin acts as
a growth factor that has the capability to promote cancer
cell proliferation [17, 18]. However, in one in vitro study,
leptin was shown to inhibit the growth of pancreatic
cancer cells [50]. Such an inhibitory effect of leptin on
pancreatic cancer was not observed in our study. In our in
vitro experiment, the growth curves were almost identical
between the leptin-treated or non-treated groups in both
the PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells. The in vivo experiments
confirmed that leptin has no inhibitory effect on pancreatic
cancer. In a subcutaneous transplanted tumor model,
leptin even promoted the growth of cancer xenografts.
The factors contributing to this discrepancy are not clear
from the current data. A possible explanation is that the
leptin concentration we and many others [22-24, 26]
have used to treat the cells was 50-100 ng/ml, while in
the study showing that leptin inhibited pancreatic cancer
cell growth [50], the authors used 0.4-4 ng/ml of leptin
for stimulation. Because the physiological levels of
circulating leptin in humans is approximately 4 ng/ml,
whether leptin has a divergent function on cell growth
at elevated or reduced pathological concentrations is an
interesting issue and warrants further investigation. It
will aid in the understanding of the differential oncogenic
impacts of hyperleptinemia during the pre-cancer stage
and hypoleptinemia during the advanced stages of
pancreatic cancer.
The impact of leptin on cancer metastasis has
never been investigated in pancreatic cancer. Although
the leptin-stimulated enhancement of cell migration and
invasion has been reported before in various cancers,
the evidence was obtained from the in vitro experiments
such as wound healing or Transwell assay [22, 26, 32,
34, 35]. Thus, our in vivo results were novel not only
for pancreatic cancer, but also for other types of cancers.
Another novel finding of this study is that MMP-13 may
play an important role in leptin-induced pancreatic cancer
metastasis. Human MMP-13, also known as collagenase-3,
is a matrix metalloproteinase originally identified in breast
carcinomas [51]. Recent studies have revealed that this
enzyme is also produced by a variety of malignant tumors,
including head and neck, breast and colorectal cancer
[52-54]. In all of the cases, the expression of MMP-13
is associated with aggressive tumors. Pancreatic cancer is
known to be an extremely lethal neoplasm that has a high
potential for invasion and metastasis. In the present study,
we compared the expression levels of MMP-2, MMP7, MMP-9 and MMP-13 in pancreatic cancer cells with
and without leptin treatment. We found that only MMP13, but not MMP-2, MMP-7 or MMP-9, was altered
following the leptin stimulation. The leptin-induced
MMP-13 expression was blocked when a JAK2/STAT3

Substantial evidence indicates that obesity and
diabetes mellitus are two risk factors for pancreatic
cancer [4-6]. However, the molecular connection between
metabolic diseases and pancreatic cancer is obscure.
Leptin, a 16-kDa protein encoded by the ob gene, is
predominantly produced by adipocytes [13]. It was
originally described as a circulating hormone involved
in feeding behavior and energy homeostasis through its
actions on the hypothalamus, where Ob-Rs are highly
expressed [39, 40]. Later, Ob-Rs were found to have a
wide distribution in different tissues [16], suggesting
that leptin may have numerous peripheral effects.
Indeed, leptin has since been found to be able to regulate
numerous biological processes, including inflammation,
angiogenesis, and proliferation [15-17]. In this study,
we focused our interests on leptin’s effect on pancreatic
cancer. We demonstrated that the leptin receptor Ob-Rb
is present in pancreatic cancer cells, and the activation
of Ob-Rb can enhance the invasion of pancreatic cancer
via upregulating MMP-13 production. These findings
highlight the potential of leptin/Ob-Rb as a novel
therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.
The deregulation of leptin and Ob-Rs has been
shown in various cancers [17]. As for pancreatic cancer,
there is a lack of convincing clinical investigations on
the relationship between circulating leptin levels and
cancer, until now. From the existing results, it appears that
patients with pancreatic cancer had a lower concentration
of circulating leptin compared to the controls [41-43].
However, it should be noted that all of the available
studies are cross-sectional studies, where the circulating
leptin levels were evaluated after the diagnosis of
pancreatic cancer. Because pancreatic cancer patients
usually have pathological weight loss or cachexia, the
decreased leptin concentrations may be secondary to the
loss of body fat mass [42]. The real correlation between
the circulating leptin and pancreatic cancer still requires
data from prospective cohort studies. On the converse, it
is also possible that the carcinogenic effect of leptin on the
pancreas is induced by an overabundance of local rather
than systemic leptin [44]. For these reasons, we focused
our study on the leptin receptor instead of leptin itself.
The leptin receptor has been reported to be
necessary for maintaining the cancer cell’s stem cell-like
properties in triple-negative breast cancer cells [45]. The
aberrant expression of Ob-Rb in cancer cells has been
suggested to be a useful prognostic marker in ovarian,
breast, and endometrial cancer [46-48]. However, limited
data are available on the state of Ob-Rb and its clinical
relevance in pancreatic cancer. Therefore, our findings
presented in this study are novel and interesting. Given
that leptin receptor antagonists effectively inhibit breast
cancer in mouse models [49], it is promising that utilizing
a synthetic analog or monoclonal antibody as a leptin

inhibitor was introduced into the experiments, confirming
that MMP-13 is a responsive downstream molecule of
leptin. In addition, in both mouse transplanted pancreatic
cancer and human clinical pancreatic cancer tissues, we
observed a correlation between Ob-Rb and MMP-13.
Therefore, the conclusion that leptin regulates MMP-13 in
pancreatic cancer is solid. Previously, leptin was reported
to be able to increase the expression of MMP-2, MMP7 or MMP-9 in different cancer cells [32-34], as well
as the expression of MMP-13 in glioma cells [35]. This
suggested that leptin’s regulation of MMPs is in a tissuespecific manner. In glioma cells, the up-regulation of
MMP-13 by leptin was mediated through p38 MAP kinase
and NF-κB pathway [35], while in pancreatic cancer cells,
we found that the expression of MMP-13 was regulated
through JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in response to
leptin stimulation. Recently, Tan et al compared the global
gene expression of two pancreatic cancer cell lines with
different potentials for invasion-metastasis using cDNA
microarray technique [38]. They found that the expression
of MMP-13 was markedly increased (30-fold) in the
highly invasive/metastatic cells compared with the weakly
invasive/metastatic cells [38]. The translational value of
MMP-13 in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of
pancreatic cancer is definitely worth further exploration.
The limitation of this study is that we did
not simultaneously test the leptin expression using
immunohistochemistry in the pancreatic cancer tissues
due to the secretory nature of leptin, which makes
quantitative analysis a challenge. Therefore, it remains to
be determined whether the action of leptin in pancreatic
cancer is exerted via an autocrine, paracrine or endocrine
mode.
Taken together, this study provides the in vitro and
in vivo evidence, for the first time, that leptin signaling
contributes to the invasion and metastasis of pancreatic
cancer. It also suggests a novel JAK2/STAT3/MMP-13
axis by which leptin exerts its action on pancreatic cancer
metastasis (schematic diagram in Supplementary Figure
S2). This study suggests leptin signaling as an attractive
target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, especially
for patients with metabolic disorders. Recently, studies
from Blagosklonny’s group have found that intermittent
administration of rapamycin could prevent weight gain
and reduce peripheral leptin level in mice on high-fat diet
without changing metabolic parameters such as insulin,
glucose, triglycerides and insulin-like growth factor 1
[55, 56]. Another study has shown that in a rat model
of obesity, rapamycin was able to normalize elevated
serum leptin by alleviating obesity and decreasing
leptin synthesis in white adipose tissues [57]. Therefore,
rapamycin may be used as an anti-leptin agent for the
prevention and intervention against obesity-related
pancreatic cancer. Interestingly, a pilot study has already
shown that rapamycin could effectively inhibit pancreatic
cancer growth in diet-induced obese mice [58]. Although
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the tumor suppressive effect of rapamycin was thought
to be mediated through PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway,
our current findings suggest that downregulation of leptin
levels may also contribute to the rapamycin-induced
pancreatic cancer suppression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and antibodies
The recombinant human leptin was purchased from
R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The JAK2 inhibitor
AG490 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA), and the MMP-13 inhibitor CL82198 was
obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The following
antibodies were used in the study: the antibody for the
long form of the leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) was purchased
from Proteintech Group (Chicago, IL); the STAT3 and
phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3Try705) antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology; the MMP-13
antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA);
the leptin antibody was purchased from BioVendor (Brno,
Czech Republic); and the β-actin antibody was purchased
from Sigma.

Cell culture and treatment
The human pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and
AsPC-1 were acquired from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM and
RMPI-1640 medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA),
respectively. For the treatment, the human pancreatic
cancer cells were serum starved for 16 h and were then
treated with recombinant human leptin at 100 ng/ml in the
absence or presence of AG490 (100 μmol/l) or CL82198
(10 μg/ml) for the indicated durations.

RNA isolation and RT-PCR
The total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) and was subjected to reverse
transcription using the FastQuant RT kit with gDNase
(Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). The synthesized
cDNA was used as a template for the semiquantitative
PCR detection of the mRNA expression of Ob-Rt and
Ob-Rb as previously described [22]. A quantitative realtime PCR analysis of the mRNA expression of the MMPs
was performed using the FastStart Universal SYBR Green
Master kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)
using the StepOne Plus Real-time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The relative expression
levels of the target genes were calculated following

primers for the semiquantitative or quantitative PCR are
provided in Supplementary Table S1.

Cl82198 along with the leptin. After 24 h of incubation,
the cells remaining on the upper surface of the insert
membrane were gently removed using a sterile cotton
swab. The cells that had invaded through the Matrigel and
adhered to the bottom of the insert membrane were fixed
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% methanol.
The cell invasion was quantitated by counting the number
of invaded cells. The data were expressed as the relative
changes in the cell invasion.

Western blot
Whole-cell lysates were prepared using RIPA
buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), and the proteins were
quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Equal amounts of proteins were separated
using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and were blotted onto
PVDF membranes. After blocking with SuperBlock
blocking buffer (Thermo Scientific), the blots were probed
with the antibodies described above. The immunodetection
was performed using Pierce SuperSignal West Pico
chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific).

Collagen zymography
Samples of the supernatant medium that were
conditioned using different cell cultures were centrifuged
to remove any cell debris and were then concentrated
using Amicon Ultra 10K Centrifugal Filters (EMD
Millipore, Billerica, MA). Equal volumes of each sample
were subjected to collagen zymography using an MMP
Zymography (MMP-1/MMP-13) Assay Kit (GENMED,
Shanghai, China) according the manufacturer’s protocol.
The location of the collagenolytic activity was visualized
as clear bands against a blue background.

Cell proliferation assay
Approximately 5 × 103 serum-starved cells were
cultured in the presence of leptin for 24, 48, or 72 h in
96-well tissue culture-plates. The cell proliferation was
assessed using the CellTiter 96 MTS Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI) according to the vender’s instructions.
The 490-nm absorbance was measured after a 2-hour
incubation with the MTS reagent.

Lentivirus vector construction and transduction
The full-length human leptin or MMP-13 genes
(Genechem, Shanghai, China) were subcloned into
the expression lentivector pCDH-CMV-MCS (System
Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) between the NheI and
SalI sites. Packaging of the lentivirus was performed
using the pPACKH1 Lentivector Packaging kit (System
Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The infectious lentiviral particles were concentrated via
centrifugation with an Amicon Ultra 100K Centrifugal
Filter (EMD Millipore). The PANC-1 cells were then
transduced with the recombinant lentivirus carrying
the human leptin or MMP-13 gene to generate stable
transduced PANC-1-Leptin or PANC-1-MMP13 cells.
The PANC-1 cells were also infected with an empty virus
and used as control cells (PANC-1-Lv). The primers for
cloning are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Cell migration assay (scratch assay)
The cell migration was measured using a scratch
wound-healing assay. After 16 h of serum starvation, the
confluent cell monolayers were wounded by scratching
with a sterile pipette tip. Then, the cells were washed
with serum-free medium to remove any debris and were
subsequently treated with leptin in the absence or presence
of AG490 or CL82198. At time 0 and after 12 or 24 h, the
plates were examined and photographed using a phasecontrast microscope. The cell migration was quantitated
by counting the number of cells that had migrated into the
wound. The data were expressed as the relative changes in
the cell migration.

Animal experiment

Cell invasion assay

The male athymic BALB/c nude mice (5-6 weeks
old) used in this study were maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions, and were manipulated in
accordance with the ethical guidelines provided under the
protocols approved by the Medical Experimental Animal
Care Commission at Shanghai Jiaotong University.
For the subcutaneous model of pancreatic cancer,
the mice were randomly divided into groups and were
subcutaneously injected in their right flanks with 3 × 106
PANC-1-Lv or PANC-1-Leptin cells. The tumor growth

For the in vitro tumor cell invasion studies, a
Matrigel-based invasion assay was performed using
8-μm pore-size culture inserts (BD Biosciences, Bedford,
MA) coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The
control cells or the leptin-treated cells were suspended
in serum-free medium and seeded into upper inserts at 1
× 105 cells per insert, and a 10% FBS medium was used
as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber. In some of
the experiments, the cells were treated with AG490 or

was monitored once a week and the tumor volume was
calculated according to the following formula: volume
= π/6 × width2 × length. The mice were sacrificed when
moribund (day 63), and the tumors were excised and
weighed.
For the orthotopic models of pancreatic cancer,
the tumor cells were injected into the mouse pancreases
according to a previously described method [59]. Briefly,
the animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal
injection of pelltrobarbitalum natricum. A small incision
was made and 1 × 106 PANC-1-Lv or PANC-1-Leptin
cells suspended in 50 μl of a Matrigel mixture (1:1
volume) were injected into the head/neck region of the
pancreas. At the end of the experiment (day 53), the mice
were euthanized. The tumor-bearing pancreases were
excised from each mouse, and the primary tumors were
then identified and weighed. The other organs, including
the liver, spleen, lung, and celiac LNs were checked
for metastasis. The metastatic LNs were counted and
confirmed histologically.

25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), or 4 (76-100%). The final
expression scores (ranging from 0 to 12) for each sample
were determined as the product of the intensity score and
the percentage score.

Statistical analysis
The data were presented as the mean ± SEM
unless indicated otherwise. The statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS software version 19.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL). The significance of the differences
between groups was assessed using Student’s t test (for the
normally distributed variables) or the Wilcoxon rank sum
test (for the non-normally distributed variables) unless
otherwise noted, and the level of significance was set at
0.05 for all of the analyses.

Patients and pancreatic cancer tissues
A total of 60 pancreatic cancer tissue specimens
were collected from patients who underwent surgical
treatment at the East Surgery Department of Renji
Hospital (Shanghai, China) between 2012 and 2013. The
60 pancreatic cancer patients, none of whom had received
chemotherapy prior to the surgery, included 27 males
and 33 females (median age 63 years, ranging from 37
to 91 years). All of the tissue specimens were routinely
fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered neutral formalin and were
embedded in paraffin. At least one pathologist examined
the H&E-stained sections to ensure the presence of >85%
tumor cells. The use of the tissue specimens in this study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of Renji Hospital,
and informed consent was obtained from each patient.

Histological analyses
The tissue samples were fixed in 4% phosphatebuffered neutral formalin (for at least 72 h), embedded
in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. The sections were
stained with H&E as per standard procedures. For
the immunohistochemical staining, the sections were
incubated with an anti-leptin antibody (1:400) or an antiMMP-13 antibody (1:200) at 4°C overnight. The primary
antibodies were detected using the Impress Universal kit
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with NovaRed
(Vector Laboratories) as a substrate. The human pancreatic
cancer tissue sections were blindly examined and scored
concurrently by two observers. The intensity of the
immunostaining was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2
(moderate), or 3 (strong). Additionally, the percentage of
positive tumor cells was scored as 0 (no stained cells), 1 (<
