Abstract

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

As a sensor of cellular energy status, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is believed to act
in opposition to the metabolic phenotypes favored by proliferating tumor cells. Consequently,
compounds known to activate AMPK have been proposed as cancer therapeutics. However, the
extent to which the anti-neoplastic properties of these agonists are mediated by AMPK is unclear.
Here we examined the AMPK-dependence of six commonly used AMPK agonists (metformin,
phenformin, AICAR, 2DG, salicylate and A-769662) and their influence on cellular processes
often deregulated in tumor cells. We demonstrate that the majority of these agonists display
AMPK-independent effects on cell proliferation and metabolism with only the synthetic activator,
A-769662, exerting AMPK-dependent effects on these processes. We find that A-769662 promotes
an AMPK-dependent increase in mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity (SRC). Finally, contrary
to the view of AMPK activity being tumor suppressive, we find A-769662 confers a selective
proliferative advantage to tumor cells growing under nutrient deprivation. Our results indicate that
many of the anti-growth properties of these agonists cannot be attributed to AMPK activity in
cells, and thus any observed effects using these agonists should be confirmed using AMPKdeficient cells. Ultimately, our data urge caution, not only regarding the type of AMPK agonist
proposed for cancer treatment, but also the context in which they are used.

Introduction
AMPK is a highly conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase complex that monitors the bioenergetic
state of a cell. AMPK is a heterotrimeric kinase complex composed of a catalytic α subunit
and two regulatory subunits, β and γ. AMP or ADP binding to the γ subunit of the AMPK
complex promotes increased kinase activity of the α subunit and phosphorylation at Thr-172
by upstream kinases.1–3 AMPK activation promotes ATP conservation by inhibiting cell
growth and proliferation.4 AMPK also inhibits anabolic/growth-promoting pathways
including lipid biosynthesis,5 TORC1-dependent protein biosynthesis,6, 7 and cell
proliferation.8, 9 Thus, under nutrient stress, AMPK promotes a metabolic and proliferative
phenotype unfavorable to proliferating cancer cells and as such is thought to negatively
impact tumorigenesis.10

One tangible link between AMPK and tumor suppression is the fact that the upstream
AMPK kinase LKB1 is a tumor suppressor.11 LKB1 is inactivated in patients with PeutzJegher’s syndrome,12 a condition that predisposes these individuals to gastrointestinal
polyps and malignant tumors.13, 14 Recent clinical studies have also identified LKB1 as the
second most frequently mutated tumor suppressor in sporadic human lung cancer.15 AMPK
activity is dramatically reduced in both human and mouse tumors lacking LKB1,16, 17
providing evidence that LKB1 loss reduces AMPK pathway activity in tumors. We have
recently shown that loss of AMPK can cooperate with Myc to accelerate
lymphomagenesis,18 indicating that AMPK itself can act as a tumor suppressor. Thus,
stimulating the anti-tumor activity of AMPK has been proposed as a possible anti-neoplastic
therapy.19

Interest in the therapeutic advantages of activating AMPK with chemical agonists has
increased as more evidence has emerged supporting an anti-tumorigenic role for the kinase.
The most convincing data that AMPK agonists may function as anti-cancer agents has been
through experiments using biguanides, such as metformin and phenformin, in therapeutic
settings. Metformin is a first-line therapy for type II diabetes that functions by inhibiting
complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.20, 21 Metformin-dependent
inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) promotes an increase in intracellular
ADP and AMP, leading to indirect AMPK activation. Retrospective analysis of tumor
development in type II diabetics revealed evidence that patients on metformin were
associated with a significantly lower cancer incidence than those patients on other
medication.22, 23 Furthermore, treatment of animals harboring tumor xenografts with
metformin or phenformin has been shown to delay progression of established tumors.24–26
Several prospective clinical trials examining anti-neoplastic effects of metformin are
currently ongoing.27
Other AMPK agonists, such as the AMP mimetic AICAR and the synthetic activator
A-769662, are commonly used in the laboratory to activate AMPK, and have also been
explored as anti-neoplastic agents. AICAR is metabolized in cells into the
monophosphorylated nucleotide ZMP, which can bind the γ subunit in place of AMP,28
leading to AMPK activation. Various studies have shown that AICAR can inhibit tumor cell
proliferation.9, 29, 30 A-769662 activates AMPK directly in cell-free assays independently of

adenylate levels.31 It was recently discovered that salicylate, the metabolic derivative of
aspirin, can activate AMPK by binding the same site on the AMPKβ1 subunit as
A-769662.32 Both A-769662 and salicylate can promote whole-body fat oxidation in mice in
an AMPK-dependent manner.32 For many years salicylate has been known to possess antitumor properties;33 however, it has several cellular targets in addition to AMPK, and it is not
known to what extent, if at all, these effects are dependent on AMPK activation.

In this study, we have systematically assessed the impact of six common AMPK agonists on
a defined set of tumor cell phenotypes. We examined the effects of the chemical agonists on
mTOR signalling, proliferation, apoptosis, viability, and cellular metabolism, and used nontransformed and transformed cells lacking AMPK expression to verify the specificity of
these effects to AMPK. We find that while these agonists exert significant effects on
proliferation and metabolism, many of these effects are AMPK-independent, with only
A-769662 displaying AMPK-specific effects on proliferation and metabolism. This study
provides a reference point for the use of chemical AMPK agonists as research tools, and
catalogs the effects of these compounds on cellular processes and their dependence on
AMPK.

Results
Agonists activate AMPK in a dose-dependent manner and stimulate downstream signalling

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

AMPK agonists are commonly used in the laboratory to assess the impact of AMPK
signalling. Here we investigated the cellular effects of six AMPK agonists that activate
AMPK either directly (A-769662 and salicylate) or indirectly (metformin, phenformin, 2DG
and AICAR) (schematic in Figure 1A). We first examined the effect of these agonists on
AMPK signalling in HEK293 cells and immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs)
lacking both catalytic isoforms of AMPK (AMPKα1/α2−/−, labelled hereafter as DKO) via
immunoblot. HEK293 cells were pre-treated with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
kinase 2 (CAMKK2) inhibitor STO-609 prior to stimulation to reduce basal AMPK
phosphorylation, as has been done previously.6 In HEK293 cells, each agonist induced
phosphorylation of the AMPK downstream substrate ACC, which is widely used as a
biomarker for AMPK activity.34 AMPK phosphorylation at Thr-172 was minimally induced
by each agonist in most cases (Figure 1B) (see discussion). In wild type (WT) MEFs, each
agonist induced phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in a dose-dependent manner, whereas
AMPK and ACC phosphorylation were completely absent in DKO MEFs, as was AMPKα
expression (Figure 1C).
One of the main downstream effects of AMPK signalling is the inhibition of mTORC1
activity.10 Thus, we investigated the AMPK-specific effects of each agonist on mTORC1
signalling using WT and DKO MEFs. All agonists except metformin promoted increased
phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate raptor in WT but not DKO MEFs (Figure 2).
Phosphorylation of the downstream mTORC1 substrate p70S6K (S6K) was reduced by all
agonists to varying degrees (with the exception of 2DG), with phenformin, salicylate and
A-769662 promoting the greatest decreases in pS6K levels. This is consistent with the large
increase in raptor phosphorylation induced by phenformin, salicylate and A-769662. Total
S6K levels were also decreased by salicylate and phenformin treatment in DKO cells,

despite the lack of functional AMPK activity in these cells. Treatment with all agonists, with
the exception of metformin, promoted hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1, as indicated by the
presence of lower molecular weight bands on the immunoblot in WT MEFs (Figure 2).
Phenformin promoted hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 to the greatest extent, although this
effect was also partially observed in AMPK-deficient MEFs, suggesting that phenformin
may also affect 4E-BP1 phosphorylation through AMPK-independent mechanisms (Figure
2).
The majority of AMPK agonists inhibit cell proliferation in an AMPK-independent manner

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Activation of AMPK has previously been linked to reduced proliferation and cell cycle
arrest.8, 9, 35 Thus, we assessed HEK293 cell proliferation using crystal violet staining
following 48h of culture with the various AMPK agonists. Similar to our results with mTOR
signaling, all agonists except metformin reduced HEK293 cell proliferation (Figure 3A).
The anti-proliferative effects of these agonists were largely dose-dependent, with only
AICAR failing to act in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). We next assessed the
AMPK-dependence of these agonists on cell proliferation by conducting growth assays
using WT and DKO MEFs. Phenformin, AICAR, 2DG and salicylate reduced the
proliferation of WT MEFs in a largely dose-dependent manner, but also had a dramatic
suppressive effect on the proliferation of AMPKα-null cells (Figure 3B). These results were
confirmed by cell counting assays for WT and DKO MEFs over a range of agonist
concentrations at 24, 48 and 72h (Figure S1A).
To further examine the impact of AMPK agonists on cell proliferation we conducted cell
cycle analysis of WT and DKO MEFs using propidium iodide (PI) staining (Figure 3C and
S1B). To evaluate the distribution of actively dividing cells before the induction of cell death
we harvested cells 24h after treatment with the various compounds. Phenformin treatment
promoted an increase in the proportion of cells in G1 phase, while AICAR treatment led to a
decrease in the proportion of cells G2/M, and these effects were observed in both WT and
DKO MEFs (Figure 3C and S1B). Incubation with 2DG did not significantly affect the cell
cycle profile in WT MEFs (slight increase of cells in S phase, with a reduction in the
percentage of G2/M phase cells), whereas 2DG promoted a decrease in the proportion of
DKO cells in S phase, suggesting 2DG treatment promotes cell cycle arrest in DKO cells
(Figure 3C and S1B).

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

We next assessed the effect of A-769662 on the proliferation of WT and DKO MEFs. In
contrast to other AMPK agonists, A-769662 reduced the proliferation of WT MEFs by 20–
30%, but did not affect the proliferation of DKO MEFs (Figure 3D). Cell cycle analysis of
WT MEFs treated with A-769662 indicated a decrease in the proportion of G2/M phase cells
combined with an increase in G1 phase cells, which was not observed to the same extent in
DKO cells (Figure 3E and S1C).
To assess whether AMPK agonists could induce apoptosis in HEK293 and MEF cells, we
assayed for active (cleaved) caspase 3 in compound-treated cells. We first assessed the extent
of caspase 3 cleavage in HEK293 cells following 48h of culture with the various AMPK
agonists. All agonists except metformin led to a mild, dose-dependent increase in caspase 3

cleavage (Figure 4A), mirroring our cell proliferation results (Figure 3A). Phenformin
treatment led to the greatest increase in caspase 3 cleavage in HEK293 cells (Figure 4A).
We next assessed whether the effect of these agonists on apoptosis was AMPK-dependent by
measuring levels of active caspase 3 in WT and DKO MEFs. Consistent with the reduced
proliferation observed in DKO cells (Figure 3B), phenformin, AICAR, 2DG and salicylate
mildly increased caspase 3 cleavage in WT MEFs, but promoted a dramatic dose-dependent
increase in caspase 3 activation in DKO MEFs (Figure 4B). In addition, DKO cells
displayed increased levels of dead cells in response to phenformin, AICAR, 2DG, and
salicylate treatment (Figure 4C), indicating increased sensitivity to apoptosis by these
agonists in AMPKα−/− cells.
We next assessed the effect of A-769662 on the viability of WT and DKO MEFs. In contrast
to other AMPK agonists, A-769662 treatment led to a small increase in caspase 3 cleavage
in WT MEFs and no change in DKO MEFs (Figure 4D). The reduced proliferation of WT
cells induced by A-769662 was not accompanied by increased cell death (Figure 4E),
suggesting an overall effect of A-769662 on cell proliferation and but not cell viability.

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Finally, we assessed the impact of AMPK agonists on tumor cell proliferation using
HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. Consistent with our results using HEK293 cells and MEFs,
phenformin, 2DG and salicylate exhibited the greatest suppressive effect on cell proliferation
under anchorage-independent conditions (Figure 5A). We next measured the level of AMPK
activation and activity in HCT116 cells expressing AMPKα1/2 shRNAs18, 36, 37 to
determine the AMPK-dependence of the results observed in Figure 5A. All AMPK agonists
tested induced AMPKα phosphorylation at Thr-172 as well as phosphorylation of
downstream substrates ACC and raptor in HCT116 cells, and the effect of these agonists on
mTORC1 or AMPK signaling were reduced in HCT116 cells expressing AMPKα1/2
shRNAs (Figure 5B). AMPKα1/2 shRNA-expressing HCT116 cells displayed increased
sensitivity to cell growth arrest in response to AICAR, 2DG and salicylate treatment relative
to control cells (Figure 5C). Of note, A-769662 had little effect on tumor cell growth in this
assay. Downregulation of AMPK signaling did not significantly change the sensitivity
HCT116 cells to growth arrest induced by phenformin (Figure 5C, black bars, and Figure
S2).
AMPK agonists differentially affect glycolysis

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

We recently demonstrated that loss of AMPK promotes an increase in aerobic glycolysis,18 a
metabolic profile of tumor cells also known as the Warburg effect.38 One inference from
these data is that AMPK may function as a negative regulator of glycolysis. Thus, we
examined the metabolic impact of AMPK agonists on proliferating cells. HEK293 cells were
cultured for 48h with the various AMPK agonists, and then glucose consumption (Figure
6A) and lactate production (Figure 6B) by cells was measured. Interestingly, AMPK
agonists displayed differential effects on glycolytic metabolism. Metformin and phenformin
increased both glucose consumption and lactate production by HEK293 cells, while AICAR
and 2DG treatment reduced glucose consumption and lactate production. In contrast,
salicylate and A-769662 exerted no significant effects on glucose uptake or lactate
production.

We next cultured WT and DKO MEFs with AMPK agonists to assess the AMPKdependence of the changes in glucose metabolism observed in Figures 6A and 6B.
Metformin and phenformin elevated glucose consumption independent of AMPKα
expression after 24h (Figure S3C) or 48h (Figure 6C) of culture, and did so in a dosedependent manner (Figure S3A). Consistent with our previous observations,18 lactate
production was elevated in DKO MEFs relative to WT MEFs (Figure 6D). However, similar
to glucose consumption, lactate production was increased by biguanide treatment regardless
of AMPKα expression (Figure 6D, S3B, and S3D). We also measured the extracellular
acidification rate (ECAR), an indicator of glycolytic rate, of WT and DKO MEFs following
6h incubation with these compounds. Biguanide treatment promoted an increase in ECAR in
both WT and DKO MEFs (Figure 6E), indicating that the pro-glycolytic effects of
biguanides are AMPK-independent. In contrast, AICAR and 2DG reduced glucose
consumption (Figure 6F and S3C), lactate production (Figure 6G and S3D) and ECAR
(Figure 6H) in both WT and DKO MEFs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S3A and
S3B). Salicylate and A-769662 induced a small reduction in glucose consumption in
HEK293 cells (Figure 6A), but this effect was not observed in MEFs (Figure S3E).

AMPK agonists differentially affect mitochondrial respiration

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Given the links between AMPK and oxidative metabolism,39 we next assessed the impact of
AMPK agonists on mitochondrial respiration using a Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer.
We first assessed the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and level of coupled respiration in
WT and DKO MEFs treated with AMPK agonists. Coupled respiration is the proportion of
mitochondrial respiration coupled to ATP production as opposed to the consequence of
proton leak (uncoupled), which does not generate ATP. To differentiate between these two
states, we measured the OCR of MEF cells treated acutely with oligomycin (an ATP
synthase inhibitor) followed by rotenone and antimycin A (to block mitochondrial electron
transport). Consistent with their roles as complex I inhibitors,20, 21 metformin and
phenformin reduced the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and proportion of coupled
respiration in both WT and DKO MEFs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 7A and B).
Similar to the function of biguanides, 2DG reduced OCR in both WT and DKO MEFs
(Figure S4B), while having no impact on the level of coupled respiration (Figure S4A). As
reported,40, 41 salicylate promoted the uncoupling of cellular respiration expression (Figure
7A), but did not alter cellular OCR (Figure 7B). DKO MEFs displayed a slight resistance to
salicylate-dependent mitochondrial uncoupling (Figure 7A).
We next examined the impact of A-769662 on mitochondrial bioenergetics. Treatment of
WT MEFs with A-769662 promoted a 60% drop in OCR, while having little effect on DKO
cells (Figure 7C). In addition, A-769662 promoted a 4-fold increase in mitochondrial spare
respiratory capacity (SRC) in WT cells (Figure 7D). SRC is the reserve mitochondrial
capacity available for energy promotion and is an index of cellular metabolic fitness.42 In
contrast to WT MEFs, SRC in DKO cells was approximately 60–70% of that of control cells
and was unaffected by A-769662 treatment (Figure 7D). Of the AMPK agonists tested, only
A-769662 displayed AMPK-specific changes in SRC. The observed effect of A-769662 on
SRC of AMPKα-expressing cells was dose-dependent and maximal between 12.5 – 25μM
(Figure 7E).

A-769662 promotes tumor cell growth under low glucose conditions
To investigate the impact of AMPK activation on mitochondrial respiratory capacity in
cancer cells, we examined the SRC of HCT116 colon carcinoma cells and H1299 non-smallcell lung carcinoma cells following treatment with A-769662. SRC increased in a dosedependent manner in both HCT116 and H1299 cells, achieving a maximum level between
12.5 and 25μM (Figure 8A). To investigate whether the increase in SRC promoted by
A-769662 could affect cell proliferation under nutrient-limiting conditions, we cultured
HCT116 and H1299 cells under non-adherent conditions in full glucose (25mM) or glucosefree conditions and co-cultured in the presence or absence of A-769662. As seen in Figure
8B, both HCT116 and H1299 cells displayed a ~30% increase in cell proliferation under
glucose-free conditions specifically when treated with A-769662. In contrast, A-769662
treatment did not affect the proliferation of HCT116 or H1299 cells expressing AMPKα1/
α2 shRNAs (Figure 8B).

Discussion
PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Chemical agonists of AMPK have been frequently used to research the cellular effects of
AMPK activation. Recent work linking AMPK activation to inhibitory effects on cell growth
and proliferation has increased interest in exploring the use of AMPK agonists for anticancer therapy,19 particularly biguanides.27 In this study, we systematically examined the
effect of 6 AMPK agonists (metformin, phenformin, AICAR, salicylate, 2DG and
A-769662) on cellular functions associated with proliferating cells. We focused our work on
processes often deregulated in tumorigenesis: mTORC1 signalling (Figure 2), proliferation,
apoptosis and viability (Figures 3 – 5), glycolysis (Figure 6), and mitochondrial respiration
(Figure 7). Given that many of these agonists promote AMPK activation by indirect
mechanisms (with the exception of salicylate and A-769662) (Figure 1A), allowances must
be made for ‘off-target’ or AMPK-independent effects of these compounds. Many of these
compounds have been shown to possess anti-proliferative activity;19 thus, it is important to
establish whether their cellular effects can be attributed to AMPK. We have attempted to
clarify these issues using a specific AMPK agonist (A-769662) and cells lacking AMPK
expression. We show here that all AMPK agonists used (with the exception of A-769662)
have significant AMPK-independent effects on proliferation, cell viability and metabolism.
Only A-769662 exhibited specific AMPK-dependent effects on cell growth and metabolism.
Our findings are summarized in Table 1.

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

The AMPK agonists used in this study all activated AMPK in a dose-dependent manner, as
determined by phosphorylation of both AMPKα and its downstream target ACCα. We
observed no effect of the agonists on ACCα phosphorylation in DKO MEFs, consistent with
ACCα being a reliable biomarker for AMPK activity.34 We found that the dose-dependent
induction of ACCα phosphorylation was often a better readout of agonist exposure than
phosphorylation of AMPK itself. Indeed, a high background of AMPK phosphorylation has
been observed in many cell types. For example, high AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation has
been reported in HEK293T cells due to constitutive activity of CAMKK2,6 which is also an
AMPK kinase.43 Moreover, the effects of A-769662 on AMPK phosphorylation are small
relative to its effects on ACC phosphorylation (Figure 1C and previous reports44). Our

results indicate that raptor phosphorylation at Ser792 is also a reliable readout of AMPK
activation by multiple agonists. Thus, to assay affects of agonists on AMPK function, we
recommend measuring phosphorylation of both AMPK and downstream targets (such as
ACC and raptor), and to confirm results using cells lacking AMPK expression as specific
controls for activity.

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

A key tumor suppressor function exerted by AMPK is the inhibition of mTORC1 activity.
AMPK inhibits mTORC1 signalling through multiple mechanisms, including
phosphorylation of the upstream regulator TSC27 and the mTORC1 subunit Raptor.6
A-769662, AICAR and 2DG induced AMPK-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 signalling,
whereas the effects of phenformin exhibited only partial AMPK dependence. The AMPKindependent effects of phenformin on mTORC1 signalling may be due to the increased
potency of the drug relative to metformin, but also argue that these compounds may function
through additional mechanisms to inhibit mTOR. Indeed, biguanides (metformin and
phenformin) have previously been shown to inhibit mTORC1 signaling in an AMPKindependent fashion through their effect on the Rag GTPases.45 Of note, metformin was a
poor inhibitor of mTORC1 in our cell systems. Metformin has previously been shown to
downregulate mTORC1 signalling, albeit at much higher doses than used here.46
Phenformin is 50-fold more potent than metformin,47 and unlike metformin, does not
require the expression of the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) to be transported into
cells,48 which may explain the limited efficacy of metformin in our assays. Thus, one must
consider the dose and length of biguanide treatment when considering its effects on cellular
assays.

AMPK activation has also been linked with induction of cell cycle arrest. AMPK activation
has been shown to suppress cell proliferation through multiple mechanisms including
stabilization of p538, 9 and regulation of the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors
p21WAF1 and p27CIP1.35 Of the AMPK agonists tested here, we found that only the direct
AMPK activator A-769662 displayed a small but AMPK-dependent effect on proliferation
and cell cycle progression in MEF cells without causing apoptosis. In contrast, Zadra et al.
have recently shown that MT-38, a direct chemical agonist of AMPK, induces mitotic arrest
and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells,49 suggesting that the induction of apoptosis in
response to AMPK activation may be cell-type dependent. Of note, A-769662 has been
shown in vivo to delay tumor onset in PTEN+/− mice.50 Loss of PTEN promotes increased
PI3K signalling in tumors, leading to increased Akt and mTORC1 signalling that drives
tumor progression. Our data suggest that activating AMPK (via A-769662) may have a
significant anti-tumor effect on PTEN-null tumors by shutting down amplified signalling
networks, specifically mTORC1 signalling, in this tumor type.
In contrast to A-769662, phenformin, AICAR, salicylate and 2DG increased caspase 3
activation and reduced cellular viability in addition to effects on proliferation. Rather than
this effect being dependent on AMPK, this effect was actually enhanced in cells lacking
AMPK expression. Treatment of cells with phenformin, AICAR, salicylate and 2DG applies
a metabolic stress to cells, either by reducing cellular ATP levels or mimicking an increase
in AMP levels. We and others have shown that cells lacking AMPK are unable to adapt to
energetic stress, and as a consequence are more sensitive to apoptosis induced by treatment

with these compounds.17, 24, 36 Recently, Shackelford et al. have shown that KRAS-driven
tumors lacking LKB1 are sensitive to the ATP-depleting effects of phenformin in vivo.51
Our results suggest that the effectiveness of these compounds on tumor growth in vivo may
be due to defective responses to energetic stress rather than cell cycle arrest programs. In this
light, these compounds may be specific agents for treating LKB1-deficient tumors or those
with low LKB1 or AMPK activity.

One important phenotypic change in tumors is the reprogramming of cellular metabolism to
support unrestrained cell growth.52 One of the primary metabolic changes associated with
proliferating tumor cells is the upregulation of glycolytic metabolism.38, 53 We recently
demonstrated that tumor cells lacking AMPK display enhanced rates of glycolysis at
baseline, linking AMPK to control of the Warburg effect in tumors.18 We hypothesized that
AMPK agonists may antagonize tumor cell growth by suppressing the Warburg effect and
metabolic potential of tumor cells. However, the data here indicate that AMPK agonists have
differential effects on glycolysis and oxygen consumption, and that these processes are
largely AMPK-independent. Biguanides increased glycolysis, while AICAR and 2DG
decreased glycolysis, despite the fact that AMPK was activated under all conditions (Table
1). Moreover, the effect of these agents on glucose metabolism was also observed in
AMPKα-deficient cells. Biguanides likely trigger increased glycolysis in response to
reduced OXPHOS due to complex I inhibition. Likewise, 2DG is a non-metabolizable
glucose analog and functions to block glycolysis. AICAR has been shown previously to
inhibit glycolysis in the liver,54, 55 which has been attributed to diminished glucose
phosphorylation by glucokinase and decreased concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate
(reducing allosteric activation of phosphofructokinase 1), which are both induced by the
accumulation of z-nucleotides.55 Notably, A-769662 treatment had no effect on glycolysis.
Thus, while AMPK loss promotes increased glycolysis through increased HIF-1α activity,18
acute activation of AMPK (by A-769662) appears to have no impact on glycolysis under
nutrient-replete growth conditions.

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

In contrast to glycolysis, our data indicate that AMPK activation can specifically impact
mitochondrial bioenergetics. Treatment with A-769662 reduced mitochondrial respiration in
an AMPK-dependent manner (Figure 7C). This reduction in OXPHOS may result from
AMPK-dependent inhibition of mTORC1, which has recently been shown to stimulate
OXPHOS by promoting the transition of nuclear-encoded components of the electron
transport chain that support OXPHOS.56 However, A-769662 treatment also stimulated an
AMPK-dependent increase in mitochondrial respiratory capacity. SRC is a measure of the
maximal bioenergetic capacity of the cell, and indicates the cell’s ability to respond to an
increase in energy demand.57 Stimulating SRC was a unique feature of A-769662, and may
function to prepare cells for future energetic stress.
While A-769662 is mildly anti-proliferative under high glucose conditions, cells treated with
this compound displayed a proliferative advantage when grown under glucose-free, but not
in nutrient-replete, conditions. The mechanism(s) driving this phenotype remain to be
determined. One possibility is that increased SRC stimulated by A-769662 may facilitate
increased OXPHOS and ATP production under low nutrient conditions. Alternatively,
AMPK activation may promote tumor cell viability in response to glucose deprivation by

maintaining intracellular NADPH levels, which antagonize rising reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in nutrient starved cells.58 In this context, AMPK activation by A-769662 may
paradoxically exert pro-tumorigenic properties under nutrient limitation.52 Indeed, studies in
glioblastoma59 and prostate cancer60 suggest that AMPK signalling can promote cell
survival depending on environmental context. Our data argue that more extensive
characterization of direct AMPK activators on tumor cell growth under conditions of
nutrient limitation is warranted.

In summary, we have sought to clarify the AMPK-dependent effects of defined “AMPK
agonists” on cellular function. Our results demonstrate that compounds commonly used to
activate AMPK exhibit variable effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism.
Moreover, the majority of the effects of these agonists on cell physiology are AMPKindependent. Our work suggests that the anti-growth properties of many of these compounds
(notably the biguanides, salicylate and 2DG) may be due to the induction of metabolic stress
in cells. We believe that the use of these compounds should primarily be associated with
their ability to induce cellular metabolic stress, with AMPK activation being one
consequence of their global actions on cellular bioenergetics. Attributing anti-neoplastic
properties of these compounds to AMPK should be done with caution, and results confirmed
using cells lacking AMPK activity. Our data indicate that only A-769662 exerts AMPKspecific effects on mTORC1 suppression, proliferation, and mitochondrial function. Thus,
we suggest that A-769662 be used over AICAR or biguanides to study AMPK-dependent
effects on cellular function. One specific effect of acute A-769662 treatment is an AMPKspecific effect on mitochondrial SRC, suggesting a potential mechanism for AMPKdependent bioenergetic adaptation to cells growing under metabolic stress. Together our
findings suggest that AMPK can exert growth-suppressive or growth-promoting effects on
tumor cells depending on context, and that AMPK activation may actually enhance tumor
cell growth under certain conditions. Thus, the context of using specific AMPK activators
(such as A-769662) will be important when considering its dual effects on the proliferation
and metabolism of tumor cells.

were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere supplemented with 5% (v/v) CO2.
Validation of AMPKα knockdown in HCT116 and H1299 cells has previously been
described.18
Western blots
Cells were lysed in CHAPS buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, 1mM MgCl2, 1mM EGTA, 0.5mM
CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 5mM NaF) supplemented with protease and phosphatase tablets
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland), DTT (1μg/ml), and benzamidine (1μg/ml). Cleared lysates
were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with primary
antibodies. Primary antibodies to AMPKα (pThr172-specific and total), ACC (Ser79specific and total) p70 S6-kinase (pThr389-specific and total), raptor (pSer792-specific and
total), 4E-BP1 (total) and Actin, as well as an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary
antibody were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).
Adherent growth assays

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Cells were either seeded in 96 (8000 cells/well) or 384 well plates (500 cells/well) in growth
medium. After 24h medium was replaced with fresh growth medium containing AMPK
agonists or vehicle. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 24, 48 or 72h. Cells were
either stained with crystal violet (0.05% (w/v) crystal violet and 20% (v/v) 95% ethanol) and
analyzed at 595nm on a Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) Spectramax plate reader
or Hoechst DNA stain to determine cell number by nuclei counting. Images were taken
using an Operetta High Content Imaging System and analyzed using Harmony High Content
Imaging and Analysis Software, both from Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA, USA).
Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was carried out as previously described.62 Briefly, cells were trypsinized
and fixed using 100% ethanol before staining with propidium iodide (40mg/ml). Cells were
treated with RNase A (Worthington Biochemicals, Lakewood Township, NJ, USA)
(0.5ug/ml) before samples were analyzed by an LSRII flow cytometry system (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
Cleaved caspase-3 assay

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Analysis of caspase 3 cleavage was carried out as described.16 Cells were seeded (8000
cells/well) in a 96-well plate. After 24h, medium was replaced with fresh growth medium
containing AMPK agonists or vehicle. Cells were fixed after 48h and incubated with cleaved
caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, #9661, Whitby, ON, Canada) followed by a
secondary HRP-conjugated antibody, chemiluminescent reagent was added and detected
using a Synergy HT plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). The resulting
chemiluminescent signals were normalized to cell number, determined by crystal violet
staining.
Determination of cell viability
Cells were trypsinized, harvested and stained using PI. Cell size of viable cells was
measured by flow cytometry and quantified as the mean fluorescence intensity for FSC. All

flow cytometry was conducted using Gallios (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) flow
cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo software.
Anchorage-independent growth assay
Soft agar growth assays were carried out as described in.63 Briefly cells were trypsinized
and suspended (15000cells/well) in 0.4% (w/v) noble agar in growth medium containing
AMPK agonists or vehicle. Suspension cultures were incubated for 5days at which point
10% by volume of Alamar Blue (Serotec, Kidlington, UK) was added to the wells and the
cultures incubated for 2–5h. Living cells convert Alamar Blue to a fluorescent indicator and
this is proportionate to cell number. Fluorescence was analyzed using a Synergy HT plate
reader with 544nm excitation and 590nm emission filters. Images were taken using the
Operetta High Content Imaging system.
Metabolic Assays

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Glucose production and lactate consumption was measured using a NOVA Bioanalysis flux
analyzer or the Eton Bioscience kit (Eton Bioscience, Charlestown, MA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. OCR and the ECAR of cells were measured using an XF96
Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Boston, MA, USA) as described.64 In
brief, cells were plated at 15000cells/well in growth medium for 24h. Cells were incubated
for either a further 6h or 24h in medium containing AMPK agonists or vehicle prior to
loading into the XF96 apparatus.
Statistical Analysis
Statistics were determined using paired Student’s t test using Prism software (GraphPad, San
Diego, CA, USA). Data are calculated as the mean ± SEM. Statistical significance is
represented in figures by: *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; ***, p<0.001; ****, p<0.0001.

leading to AMPK activation. Metformin and phenformin inhibit complex I of the electron
transport chain leading to an elevation in the AMP/ATP ratio and subsequent AMPK
activation. 2DG also elevates the AMP/ATP ratio by inhibiting glycolysis. Both salicylate
and A-769662 activate AMPK directly, binding to the β subunit. B) Immunoblot for ACC
(Ser79 and total), AMPKα (Thr172 and total) and actin on lysates from HEK293 cells.
HEK293 cells were pretreated with STO-609 (25μM) for 30min before incubation with
metformin (5mM), phenformin (1.25mM), AICAR (1.25mM), 2DG (12.5mM), salicylate
(2.5mM) or A-769662 (25μM) for 1h. C) Immunoblot for ACC (Ser79 and total), AMPKα
(Thr172 and total) and actin on lysates from wild-type (WT) or AMPKα-deficient (DKO)
MEFs. Cells were incubated with metformin, phenformin, AICAR, 2DG, salicylate or
A-769662 for 1h at the indicated concentrations.
