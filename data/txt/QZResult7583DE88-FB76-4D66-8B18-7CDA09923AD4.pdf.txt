Suppressing ATR Catalytic Activity

Abstract
Resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapy is a barrier to effective treatment that appears to be augmented by
p53 functional deﬁciency in many cancers. In p53-deﬁcient cells in which the G1–S checkpoint is compromised,
cell viability after DNA damage relies upon intact intra-S and G2–M checkpoints mediated by the ATR (ataxia
telangiectasia and Rad3 related) and Chk1 kinases. Thus, a logical rationale to sensitize p53-deﬁcient cancers to
DNA-damaging chemotherapy is through the use of ATP-competitive inhibitors of ATR or Chk1. To discover small
molecules that may act on uncharacterized components of the ATR pathway, we performed a phenotype-based
screen of 9,195 compounds for their ability to inhibit hydroxyurea-induced phosphorylation of Ser345 on Chk1,
known to be a critical ATR substrate. This effort led to the identiﬁcation of four small-molecule compounds, three
of which were derived from known bioactive library (anthothecol, dihydrocelastryl, and erysolin) and one of which
was a novel synthetic compound termed MARPIN. These compounds all inhibited ATR-selective phosphorylation
and sensitized p53-deﬁcient cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents in vitro and in vivo. Notably, these compounds
did not inhibit ATR catalytic activity in vitro, unlike typical ATP-competitive inhibitors, but acted in a
mechanistically distinct manner to disable ATR–Chk1 function. Our results highlight a set of novel molecular
probes to further elucidate druggable mechanisms to improve cancer therapeutic responses produced by DNAdamaging drugs. Cancer Res; 74(24); 7534–45. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Genotoxic stresses, including ionizing radiation (IR), UV
irradiation, and many chemotherapeutic agents, elicit DNA
damage checkpoints that promote cell-cycle arrest and DNA
repair (1). ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR
(ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related) are key protein kinases
that sense DNA damage and phosphorylate their downstream
targets to activate DNA damage checkpoints. IR and doxorubicin cause DNA double-strand breaks and primarily activate
the ATM–Chk2–p53 pathway. UV and hydroxyurea cause
stalled replication forks and primarily activate the ATR–Chk1

pathway. However, there is extensive crosstalk between these
two pathways (2). The resultant signaling is affected by diverse
factors, including types and doses of stress as well as timing.
Most types of genotoxic stress activate both pathways to some
degree.
Targeting DNA damage checkpoints could be beneﬁcial to
cancer treatment (3–5). In normal cells, DNA-damaging agents
activate ATM and/or ATR pathways that mediate G1–S, intra-S,
and G2–M checkpoints to arrest cell-cycle progression and
allow extra time for DNA repair. Many cancers are deﬁcient in
the G1–S checkpoint, including those with defective p53 (6, 7).
This results in reliance on later checkpoints for DNA repair and
cell survival, including the ATR pathway. If the ATR pathway is
inhibited in G1 checkpoint-deﬁcient cells in the presence of
DNA damage, cells will not elicit cell-cycle arrest for DNA
repair, leading to cancer cell death (8). Thus, inhibiting the ATR
pathway has been an appealing strategy to selectively sensitize
p53-deﬁcient cells to chemotherapeutic agents that damage
DNA (3, 4, 9).
Because ATR inhibition can sensitize cancer cells to DNAdamaging agents (8, 10, 11), inhibitors that target the ATR–
Chk1 pathway are of great interest for cancer therapy, and
some Chk1 inhibitors have entered clinical trials (4, 5, 9).
Caffeine is widely used as a nonselective ATM/ATR inhibitor
(IC50 of 200 mmol/L for ATM; IC50 of 1,100 mmol/L for ATR;
ref. 12), but more selective and potent ATR inhibitors have been
long sought to better understand DNA damage response

Identiﬁcation of ATR–Chk1 Pathway Inhibitors

pathways and to use as chemosensitizers in combination with
chemotherapeutic agents (13). Recently, schisandrin B, a
dibenzocyclooctadiene derivative isolated from an herb, has
been identiﬁed as a potent ATR-selective inhibitor (IC50 of 7.25
mmol/L for ATR; ref. 14). In addition, aminopyrazine derivatives, compound 45 (IC50 of 0.012 mmol/L for ATR; ref. 15) and
VE-821 (IC50 of 0.026 mmol/L for ATR; ref. 16), have been
identiﬁed as highly potent ATR-selective inhibitors. These
compounds sensitized cancer cells to cisplatin, while sparing
normal cells (15, 16), further supporting the potential utility of
ATR inhibition to sensitize cancer cells to death.
The mechanism of ATR activation is complex, requiring
recruitment of more than 10 proteins at sites of DNA damage
for optimal kinase activation (17). Brieﬂy, a replication fork
stalls at DNA lesions, while helicases continue to separate DNA
strands, generating single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) coated with
RPA (replication protein A; ref. 17). Multiple proteins, including
the 9–1–1 complex, TopBP1, and Claspin, are then recruited
to RPA-coated ssDNA. Thus, not only ATR kinase but also a
handful of known proteins involved in ATR pathway activation
could be targets for suppression of the ATR pathway. Most
compounds that target this pathway are believed to act as
ATP-competitive inhibitors of ATR kinase activity, such
as caffeine, schisandrin B, or VE-821. Compounds that target
other components of the ATR pathway are few in number and
typically affect nonspeciﬁc processes such as protein chaperones and stability. For example, Hsp90 inhibitors (geldanamycin and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin) deplete
Chk1 and hence block ATR pathway function, as well as many
other targets (18, 19).
A chemical genetic screen is a powerful approach to discover
small-molecule compounds that perturb cellular processes
and elucidate biologic systems (20, 21). Small molecules that
suppress the ATR–Chk1 pathway without inhibiting ATR could
be identiﬁed through pathway-targeted screening. Such compounds could uncover previously unknown but druggable
targets in signaling pathways or reveal known targets for which
no small-molecule inhibitors have been identiﬁed. To discover
novel DNA damage response inhibitors that target the ATR
pathway, we performed cell-based, high-content screening of
small-molecule compounds. Following biologic assays for validation, we found four novel small-molecule compounds that
inhibit the ATR–Chk1 pathway. Importantly, these four compounds did not directly inhibit ATR kinase catalytic activity in
vitro but had chemosensitization effects, especially in p53deﬁcient cells in vitro. One compound, dihydrocelastryl, was
also tested in a xenograft model and showed selective inhibition of p53-deﬁcient tumor growth in vivo. Identiﬁcation of
these mechanistically distinct inhibitors of DNA damage
checkpoints allows their use as probes to further elucidate
checkpoint function.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions
HeLa and 293T cells were obtained from the ATCC, authenticated through short tandem repeat proﬁling by the ATCC,
and cultured in DMEM (#11995; Invitrogen) supplemented

www.aacrjournals.org

with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (PS; Invitrogen). HCT116 p53þ/þ cells and
the isogenic p53/ cells were gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein
(Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; ref. 22) and cultured
in McCoy's 5A Medium (#16600; Invitrogen), supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% PS. p53 expression in HCT116 p53þ/þ and
p53/ cells was validated by Western blot analyses. Upon
receipt of all cell lines, frozen stocks were made at low passage
and thawed for short-term culture (less than 3 months). All
cells were maintained at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of
5% CO2.
Small-molecule screening by automated cell imaging
Screening was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and
Harvard using its small-molecule libraries, comprising known
bioactive and novel synthetic compounds. Primary screen data
were deposited to ChemBank (http://chembank.broadinstitute.org) under the project name "DNADamageImagingScreen." HeLa cells (4,000 cells/well) were plated onto 384-well
ﬂat clear bottom black polystyrene tissue culture treated
microplates (#3712; Corning) and incubated at 37 C overnight
in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2. Compound mixture of
hydroxyurea and a test compound for cell treatment was
prepared in a separate 384-well plate: 100 mmol/L hydroxyurea
was diluted with cell culture medium (DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% PS) to a ﬁnal concentration of 3 mmol/L
in 45 mL medium in each well, and a single small-molecule
compound was added to each well by 100 nL pin-transfer
(CyBio) of a compound stock solution in DMSO. Culture
medium was aspirated, and 45 mL of compound mixture was
added to each well that also contained 5 mL of residual culture
medium (total 50 mL/well). Because the average compound
concentration of stock solution was 10 mmol/L in DMSO,
the ﬁnal compound concentration for cell treatment was
20 mmol/L in test wells (ﬁnal DMSO 0.2%). Cells were incubated
with 3 mmol/L hydroxyurea and a single small-molecule compound in each well at 37 C for 2 hours in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 5% CO2. For immunoﬂuorescence, cells were
ﬁxed by adding 15 mL per well of 16% paraformaldehyde
(formaldehyde) aqueous solution (#15710; Electron Microscopy
Sciences) to 50 mL medium in each well (ﬁnal 4% formaldehyde)
and incubating at 4 C overnight. Fixed cells were treated with
2N HCl (50 mL/well) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells
were washed twice with 50 mL per well of TBS (50 mmol/L Tris,
150 mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.4) and treated with 50 mL per well of TBS
supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes at room
temperature. Cells were washed with 50 mL per well of TBS and
treated with 50 mL per well of TBS supplemented with 0.1%
sodium borohydride (#452882; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 minutes at
room temperature. Cells were washed twice with 50 mL per well
of TBS and treated with 50 mL per well of TBS supplemented
with 3% BSA (A9647; Sigma-Aldrich; 3% BSA–TBS) for 10
minutes at room temperature. Cells were incubated with 20
mL per well of 1:150 dilution of anti–phospho-Chk1 (pChk1–
Ser345) [133D3] rabbit mAb (#2348; Cell Signaling Technology)
in 3% BSA–TBS at 4 C overnight. Cells were washed with 50 mL
per well of 3% BSA–TBS and incubated with 20 mL per well of
1:150 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody

temperature. Cells were washed with 50 mL per well of 3% BSA–
TBS and incubated with 20 mL per well of 1:10 dilution of
VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium with DAPI (1.5 mg/mL
DAPI; H-1200; Vector Laboratories) in 3% BSA–TBS for 30
minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with 50
mL per well of 3% BSA–TBS and twice with 50 mL per well of
TBS. Immunoﬂuorescent images of cells stained with antipChk1 antibody and DAPI in each well were acquired by
automated ﬂuorescence microscopy using DAPI and FITC
ﬁlters (ImageXpress; Molecular Devices) and analyzed by
MetaXpress (Molecular Devices). To detect pChk1 signals only
from nuclei and eliminate background signals from cytoplasm
and the surface of cell culture wells, pChk1 nuclear signal
intensity in each well was quantitated within all nuclei of HeLa
cells (determined by DAPI-positive areas). To normalize cell
number differences among wells of screening plates, average
pChk1 nuclear signal intensity for one test compound in each
well was calculated by dividing pChk1 nuclear signal intensity
from all nuclei in each well by the number of nuclei (DAPIpositive areas). For hit compound selection, the average of
pChk1 intensities among all 384 wells of each plate (whole plate
average intensity) was deﬁned as 100% (because most compounds had a little or no effect on hydroxyurea-induced Chk1
phosphorylation), and compounds whose average pChk1
nuclear signal intensities were <85% were chosen for follow-up.

Results
A cell-based screen for novel ATR pathway inhibitors
To discover DNA damage response inhibitors that suppress
the ATR pathway and to gain insight into replication checkpoint signaling, we performed a cell-based, high-content
screen of small-molecule libraries using an automated cell
imaging platform. The speciﬁc small-molecule screen involved
detection of hydroxyurea-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 at
Ser345, a downstream target of ATR, as an indicator for ATR
pathway activation (23, 24). Hydroxyurea inhibits DNA synthesis and stalls replication forks. This replication stress
activates the ATR pathway, leading to phosphorylation of
Chk1. In this screen, HeLa cells were plated onto 384-well
plates and treated with hydroxyurea and a single small-molecule compound in each well (Fig. 1A). HeLa cells were selected
for this cell imaging assay, because this cell type demonstrated
a robust signaling response and remained adherent during
washing steps required for immunoﬂuorescence. Cells were
stained with anti–phospho-Chk1 (pChk1–Ser345) antibody
and DAPI for nuclear staining, and the immunoﬂuorescent
images of cells in each well were acquired by automated
ﬂuorescence microscopy. Subsequently, the acquired images
were analyzed to quantitate pChk1 signal intensities within
nuclei that were deﬁned by DAPI-positive areas. Compounds
that suppressed hydroxyurea-induced Chk1 phosphorylation
were selected as putative ATR pathway inhibitors.

Using this approach, hydroxyurea-induced pChk1 was reliably detected as a signiﬁcant increase in pChk1 nuclear signal
intensity (middle bar in Fig. 1B) compared with untreated cells
(left bar). Addition of 3 mmol/L caffeine (right bar) suppressed
hydroxyurea-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 to 85% of
pChk1 intensity of hydroxyurea-treated cells. This effect on
pChk1 signal intensity in cells was consistent with Western
blot results using the same pChk1 antibody (Fig. 1B), although
untreated cells showed no pChk1 signal in a Western blot
analysis. Despite relatively high nonspeciﬁc background
immunoﬂuorescence in the microscopy assay, cell imaging at
the single-nucleus level was reliable in detecting phosphoChk1 signals in a high-throughput manner.
Figure 1C shows a representative result of one 384-well plate
from the primary screen. Average pChk1 intensity of 384 wells
was set to 100% (whole-plate average shown as a solid horizontal line), presuming that the majority of compounds were
not ATR pathway inhibitors, and thus the whole-plate average
was virtually the same as the level of pChk1 induced by
hydroxyurea alone. Compounds that decreased the nuclear
pChk1 signal below 85% (dotted horizontal line) of the wholeplate average were more potent than 3 mmol/L caffeine, and
thus were selected for follow-up. From the example plate
shown in Fig. 1C, dihydrocelastryl was selected for follow-up
whereas teniposide, thiram, and bleomycin showed high levels
of pChk1 intensity (Fig. 1C). These latter three compounds are
indeed known DNA-damaging agents that activate DNA damage response pathways, suggesting that this assay could appropriately detect both activating and inhibitory compounds.
In a secondary screen, we performed dose–response experiments in triplicate by the same automated cell imaging assay
(Fig. 2A). Increasing doses of caffeine inhibited hydroxyureainduced pChk1 as a positive control. The four novel compounds (anthothecol, dihydrocelastryl, erysolin, and MARPIN:
"ATM and ATR pathway inhibitor") also inhibited phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, all of which were significantly more potent than caffeine.
Because we performed a small-molecule screen detecting
hydroxyurea-induced pChk1, we needed to exclude the possibility that these novel compounds could be merely modulators
of hydroxyurea-induced signaling, not ATR pathway inhibitors.
In a tertiary screen, we performed Western blot analyses to
validate the inhibitory effects of novel compounds on pChk1
induced by two mechanistically distinct ATR pathway activators: hydroxyurea (acts by nucleotide depletion) and UV irradiation (acts by generating polymerase-blocking thymine
dimers). Hydroxyurea-induced pChk1 was inhibited by these
novel compounds in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) as was
UV-induced pChk1 (Fig. 2C). These ﬁndings conﬁrmed that
these compounds are indeed ATR pathway inhibitors, not
merely modulators of hydroxyurea-induced signaling.
In total, we screened 9,195 compounds from two distinct
small-molecule libraries, comprising known bioactive and
novel synthetic compounds (Fig. 2D). The average compound
concentration in this cell-based screen was 20 mmol/L following pin transfer of the compounds into test wells. Test compounds that did not show dose-dependent inhibition of
hydroxyurea-induced pChk1 in the secondary and tertiary

Identiﬁcation of ATR–Chk1 Pathway Inhibitors

Figure 1. A high-content imaging screen for discovery of ATR pathway inhibitors. A, schematic of a cell-based, phenotypic screen for compounds that inhibit
hydroxyurea (HU)-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 (pChk1) at Ser345. B, Chk1 phosphorylation was quantitated within the nuclei of HeLa cells (determined
by DAPI-positive areas) following 2-hour incubation with hydroxyurea and/or caffeine (Caf) as indicated. Representative cell images are shown (top). The
mean of pChk1 nuclear intensity was calculated among 128 wells for each of three conditions (middle); error bars, SEM (n ¼ 128 wells). The pChk1 signal in
hydroxyurea-treated wells was deﬁned as 100%. Background immunoﬂuorescence signal in this assay was 76% in the absence of hydroxyurea. Western blot
analysis using clariﬁed cell lysates indicates that this relatively high-immunoﬂuorescence background is not due to baseline Chk1 phosphorylation (bottom).
C, representative data from one 384-well plate from the primary screen. Each dot is the average pChk1 nuclear signal intensity (pChk1 signal normalized
across all nuclei) from one well in which cells were treated with hydroxyurea plus one test compound. The average of pChk1 intensities among all 384 wells
of each plate (solid horizontal line) was deﬁned as 100%. Most compounds had little or no effect on hydroxyurea-induced Chk1 phosphorylation. The
threshold for selecting compounds that inhibited Chk1 phosphorylation was set to 85% (dotted horizontal line) or below, because 3 mmol/L caffeine
(effectively inhibits ATR at this concentration) typically suppressed HU-induced Chk1 phosphorylation to 85%.

screens were eliminated from further investigation. After these
screens by cell imaging and Western blot analyses, we eventually identiﬁed four novel ATR pathway inhibitors from 9,195
compounds.
Chemical structures of these novel ATR pathway inhibitors
and caffeine are shown in Fig. 2E. The four novel ATR pathway
inhibitors were structurally different from each other and from
caffeine. Anthothecol, dihydrocelastryl, and erysolin were
derived from libraries of known bioactive compounds and are
commercially available. The fourth inhibitor, identiﬁed from a
diversity-oriented synthetic library, was named MARPIN (ATM

and ATR pathway inhibitor) based on its ability to inhibit both
the ATM and ATR pathways, as determined in subsequent
experiments. MARPIN's chemical name is methyl (1R,6aR)-2benzoyl-1-(4-ﬂuorobenzyl)-6-methylene-5-oxo-1,2,3,5,6,6ahexahydrocyclopenta[c]pyrrole-1-carboxylate [ChemBank ID
1965360, PubChem Substance ID 11253916, PubChem Compound ID 3247230]. To the best of our knowledge, none of these
four compounds have been previously reported to be DNA
damage response pathway inhibitors. The hit rate from the
known bioactive compounds library (0.12%) was much higher
than that of the synthetic library (0.015%). This difference in hit

Identiﬁcation of ATR–Chk1 Pathway Inhibitors

(Fig. 2E). Thus, the novel compounds were at least 100 times
more potent than caffeine for ATR pathway inhibition in cells.
Novel ATR pathway inhibitors abrogate G2–M
checkpoint induced by IR
A pivotal function of DNA damage response kinases is to
elicit cell-cycle checkpoint signaling and stop cell-cycle
progression, allowing time for DNA repair (4). To determine
whether novel inhibitors functionally suppress cell-cycle
arrest, the effect of these compounds on the IR-induced
G2–M checkpoint was assessed by measuring the percentage
of cells positive for phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) with 4N
DNA content as an indicator of mitosis. After 2 hours, 2 Gy of
IR decreased the percentage of mitotic cells from 2.2% to
0.1% (Fig. 3A), indicating that IR activated the G2–M checkpoint and inhibited mitotic entry. Known inhibitors of ATM
and/or ATR abrogated the IR-induced G2–M checkpoint,
including caffeine (dual ATM/ATR inhibitor), KU-55933
(ATM-selective inhibitor), and VE-821 (ATR-selective
inhibitor; Fig. 3). These data suggest that the IR-induced
G2–M checkpoint is mediated via both ATM and ATR,
consistent with prior studies (25, 26). Furthermore, all four
novel ATR pathway inhibitors we discovered abrogated IRinduced G2–M checkpoint in a dose-dependent manner

(Fig. 3), supporting that these inhibitors functionally block
the induction of cell-cycle arrest, a pivotal role for DNA
damage response pathways.
Novel ATR pathway inhibitors do not directly suppress
ATR catalytic activity
To investigate whether novel compounds directly inhibit the
catalytic activity of ATR kinase, we performed in vitro ATR
kinase assays using immunopuriﬁed ATR proteins (Fig. 4).
Known nonspeciﬁc ATR inhibitors, caffeine (12) and wortmannin (27), suppressed ATR kinase activity, validating the
ATR kinase assay. However, none of the four novel compounds
suppressed ATR kinase activity in vitro even at far higher
concentrations of these compounds than were required to
inhibit hydroxyurea-induced pChk1 in cells. These results
suggest that the novel inhibitors are mechanistically distinct
from caffeine in their mode of suppressing ATR signaling in
cells.
Inhibition of ATR- and ATM-selective phosphorylation
by novel compounds
To examine whether these novel inhibitors suppress ATR- or
ATM-dependent phosphorylation events or both, we carefully
selected conditions under which signaling is predominantly

these two pathways (2). To this end, we used siRNA against
ATR or ATM to determine the extent to which a signaling event
was dependent on either of these kinases. This survey examined approximately 700 phospho-speciﬁc events under various
conditions or time points: Three different cell types (HeLa,
293T, and HCT116), ﬁve DNA-damaging agents (hydroxyurea,
UV, IR, bleomycin, and doxorubicin), three doses of each agent,
ﬁve time points, and six different phosphorylation sites on four

(Ser15 and Ser20), Chk2 (Thr68), and ATM (Ser1981)] for their
dependence on either of these kinases. We ultimately identiﬁed
hydroxyurea-induced phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) and phosphop53 (Ser15) at 2 hours in 293T cells as the most ATR-selective
phosphorylation events (Fig. 5A). The most ATM-selective
signaling event was phospho-Chk2 (Thr68) induced by low
dose (2 Gy) of IR at an early time point (15 minutes) in HCT116
p53þ/þ cells (Fig. 5B). We then used these optimized, pathwayselective conditions to test the extent to which the novel
inhibitors suppressed signaling via the ATR and ATM pathways. All four compounds inhibited ATR-selective phosphorylation events (hydroxyurea-induced phospho-Chk1 and phospho-p53) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Erysolin and
MARPIN inhibited IR-induced phospho-Chk2 in a dose-dependent manner, but anthothecol or dihydrocelastryl did not

7540

inhibit this ATM-selective phosphorylation event (Fig. 5D).
Taken together, all four compounds are ATR pathway inhibitors, two of which also have the ability to suppress the ATM
pathway at an early time point.
Novel ATR pathway inhibitors sensitize p53-deﬁcient
cells to DNA damage
G1 checkpoint-deﬁcient cells, particularly those deﬁcient in
p53 function, are resistant to DNA-damaging agents but can be
sensitized by ATR (8) or Chk1 (28, 29) inhibition. Therefore, we
tested whether these novel ATR pathway inhibitors would also
sensitize cancer cells to DNA damage. To investigate whether
these ATR pathway inhibitors can overcome the chemoresistance of p53-deﬁcient cells, we examined cell viability after
treating cells with combinations of DNA-damaging agents with
novel ATR pathway inhibitors. We used HCT116 cells (human
colorectal cancer cell lines), because the isogenic p53/ cells
are available (22), and we can readily compare p53 wild-type
(p53þ/þ) and p53-deﬁcient (p53/) cells.
First, we investigated whether novel ATR pathway inhibitors
sensitize cancer cells to cisplatin, a DNA crosslinker. Cisplatin
was selected because other studies have shown that it synergizes effectively with ATR inhibition in killing cancer cells
(11, 30). In p53 wild-type cells, cisplatin alone (10 mmol/L)
decreased cell viability (to 75%), whereas p53-deﬁcient cells

Identiﬁcation of ATR–Chk1 Pathway Inhibitors

were resistant to cisplatin (92% cell viability; Fig. 6A). Cisplatin
plus anthothecol (1 mmol/L) showed a marked synergistic
decrease in cell viability, especially in p53-deﬁcient cells
(15% cell viability).
Because ATR inhibition potentiates the effects of various
classes of chemotherapeutic drugs (11, 31), we also examined
whether these novel ATR pathway inhibitors sensitize cancer
cells to camptothecin, a Topoisomerase I poison that results in
S phase slowing. Camptothecin alone (120 nmol/L) decreased
cell viability, especially in p53 wild-type cells (53% cell
viability; Fig. 6B), but p53-deﬁcient cells were relatively resistant to camptothecin (73% cell viability). Although 1 mmol/L
dihydrocelastryl had no effect in either cell type if given alone, it
fully reversed the camptothecin-resistant phenotype of p53deﬁcient cells (73% cell viability with camptothecin alone vs.
21% when dihydrocelastryl was added).
To precisely examine whether novel ATR pathway inhibitors
show synergistic effects on decreasing cell viability in combination with DNA-damaging agents, we extensively tested
various concentrations of compounds (Supplementary Fig.
S1). These cell viability data were used to calculate synergistic
effects on decreasing cell viability (see example in Fig. 6C). All
novel ATR pathway inhibitors and caffeine showed signiﬁcant
synergistic lethality with cisplatin (Fig. 6D) and camptothecin
(Fig. 6E), especially in p53-deﬁcient cells. In contrast, an ATMselective inhibitor KU-55933 (32, 33) showed a modest synergistic effect on cisplatin treatment, implying that ATR inhibition plays a more important role in sensitizing cancer cells to
cisplatin. These results demonstrate that chemoresistant p53deﬁcient cells can be sensitized by these novel ATR pathway
inhibitors. As single agents, these compounds showed modest

cytotoxicity in HCT116 cancer cells at concentrations that
caused synergistic sensitization effects in HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1) but no cytotoxicity in normal cells (primary
human keratinocytes at 24 hours).
The doses of novel inhibitors required for effective synergistic lethality at 48 hours (1–8 mmol/L; Fig. 6) were approximately 8- to 60-fold lower than doses required for inhibition of
hydroxyurea-induced pChk1 at 2 hours (15–60 mmol/L; Fig.
5C). To verify that such very low doses of novel inhibitors that
were used for synergistic lethality experiments can suppress
cisplatin-induced pChk1, we used ﬂow cytometry (a highly
sensitive assay) to detect pChk1 status. Flow cytometry–based
measurement of pChk1 was validated by detecting the inhibitory effect of VE-821 (established ATR-selective inhibitor) on
hydroxyurea-induced pChk1 (Supplementary Fig. S2A and
S2B). Cisplatin induced phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser345
predominantly in S phase, although pChk1 induction by 10
mmol/L cisplatin was subtle, compared with pChk1 induced by
3 mmol/L hydroxyurea (Supplementary Fig. S2). At the very low
doses that showed synergistic lethality, all four novel ATR
pathway inhibitors weakly but reproducibly suppressed cisplatin-induced pChk1 (Supplementary Fig. S2D). This suggests
that low levels of ATR–Chk1 pathway inhibition are sufﬁcient
to sensitize cells to DNA-damaging agents after 48 hours,
exhibiting effective synergistic lethality.

Because novel ATR pathway inhibitors indeed sensitized
cancer cells to DNA damage in vitro, we investigated the in vivo
antitumor activity of a novel ATR pathway inhibitor and its

line (HCT116), which we had also used for cell viability studies.
This HCT116 xenograft model has been widely used to study
antitumor activity of small-molecule compounds (34). We used
both HCT116 p53-intact (p53þ/þ) cells and the isogenic p53null (p53/) cells to elucidate p53 dependency on eliminating
cancer cells. Because high doses (4 or 8 mg/kg/d) of cisplatin in
our injection schedule resulted in severe body weight loss, we
used 2 mg/kg/d of cisplatin that did not cause loss of body
weight. Dihydrocelastryl at 0.1 mg/kg/d also did not cause loss
of body weight. Cisplatin alone inhibited growth of p53þ/þ
tumors (52% tumor volume compared with vehicle treatment),
and the addition of dihydrocelastryl had no effect (Fig. 7A).
Importantly, p53/ tumors were relatively resistant to cisplatin (85% tumor volume compared with vehicle treatment),
and dihydrocelastryl sensitized p53/ tumors to cisplatin,
suppressing tumor volume to 60% (Fig. 7B). Thus, dihydrocelastryl demonstrated synergistic suppression of chemoresistant p53/ tumor growth in vivo.

Discussion
Because of potential chemotherapeutic (sensitization of
chemoresistant cells to death; refs. 3, 4) and chemopreventive
(skin cancer prevention; ref. 35) implications, ATR pathway
inhibitors have long been sought. Caffeine has been widely
used as an ATM/ATR inhibitor, but caffeine requires millimolar levels to inhibit ATR and has several other targets (12, 36).
Previous attempts to discover novel DNA damage response
inhibitors have focused on ﬁnding better ATP-competitive
inhibitors of kinases in this pathway. In the present study, we
used a phenotype-based screening approach to identify ATR

pathway inhibitors, potentially mechanistically distinct from
typical ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors. Because the ATR
activation mechanism is complex and requires multiple proteins to be recruited to damaged DNA, any of these components of the ATR pathway could potentially be a target of the
identiﬁed small-molecule inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, unlike traditional biochemical screening, this phenotype-based approach
allowed us to discover novel ATR pathway inhibitors that are
bioactive and do not act as direct ATR kinase catalytic
inhibitors.
Mutations of p53 are the most common genetic abnormality
in human cancers. The prevalence of p53 dysfunction is
approximately 50% in major human cancers, including lung,
colon, and skin cancers (6). p53-deﬁcient cells are resistant to
DNA-damaging agents (37), and there is, thus, a need to
sensitize p53-deﬁcient cells for effective cancer therapy.
Because ATR inhibition can sensitize G1 checkpoint-deﬁcient
cells to DNA-damaging agents (8), we investigated the chemosensitization abilities of novel ATR pathway inhibitors in
the present study. The ATR pathway inhibitors demonstrated
synergistic effects on cancer cell killing in p53-deﬁcient cells.
Despite the fact that these compounds did not directly inhibit
ATR kinase catalytic activity, the compounds blocked ATR
pathway function and promoted sensitization of drug-resistant p53-deﬁcient cells. Previous studies demonstrated that
loss of ATM sensitizes p53-deﬁcient cells to camptothecin, but
not cisplatin (38), whereas ATR inhibition can sensitize cancer
cells to both camptothecin (31) and cisplatin (11). In particular,
p53-deﬁcient cells are preferentially sensitized to cisplatin by
ATR inhibition (39). The inhibitors we describe here sensitized
p53-deﬁcient cells to both cisplatin and camptothecin. This

wide range of chemosensitization effects of the ATR pathway
inhibitors is potentially advantageous to cancer therapeutic
applications.
Certain barriers often block translation of a given smallmolecule compound to the in vivo setting even if the compound
has desired in vitro effects. These barriers include solubility of
the compound, in vivo stability, drug delivery to tumors, and
toxicity (40). To investigate the in vivo characteristics of a novel
ATR pathway inhibitor, we tested one compound, dihydrocelastryl, using a xenograft model. Dihydrocelastryl was selected
for xenograft experiments, because it showed strong chemosensitization for p53/ cells in the cell viability study and in an
in vivo pilot study. Dihydrocelastryl overcame these barriers
and synergistically sensitized p53-deﬁcient tumors in combination with cisplatin in vivo without severe body weight loss or
any other overt health concerns. This synergistic effect on
antitumor efﬁcacy in vivo is meaningful for reducing the dose of
cisplatin to minimize undesired toxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents, because higher doses of cisplatin (4 or 8 mg/kg/
d) were toxic to mice in this experimental setting, inducing
cachexia. Thus, ATR pathway inhibitors have the potential to
improve the efﬁcacy of existing chemotherapeutic agents that
cause DNA damage.
Three of the novel ATR pathway inhibitors that we discovered were from a library of known bioactive compounds.
Anthothecol is a limonoid of Khaya anthotheca (the mahogany
family Meliaceae) and has antimalarial activity (41). Dihydrocelastryl is structurally similar to celastrol, a triterpene
extracted from the root bark of the Chinese medicine "Thunder
of God Vine." Celastrol is a potent proteasome inhibitor and
suppresses human prostate cancer growth in nude mice (42).
Erysolin is structurally similar to sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate that has antimicrobial activity and shows cancer-preventive effects (43). Sulforaphane is abundant in broccoli
sprouts. Sulforaphane and erysolin induce detoxiﬁcation
enzymes (44). The induction of detoxiﬁcation enzymes may
be a signiﬁcant component of the anticarcinogenic action of
broccoli. Importantly, on the basis of PubMed/literature
searches, we were unable to ﬁnd prior studies, which suggest
that any of these compounds may act as inhibitors of DNA
damage checkpoint function.
Because these novel compounds inhibited the ATR pathway
without directly affecting ATR kinase catalytic activity, it is
plausible that the compounds may inhibit a mediator protein
involved in this signaling pathway. Previous studies showed
that ATM and ATR functions could be suppressed by downregulating a protein required for their signaling such as BRCA1
(45), protein phosphatase 5 (46, 47), or Timeless (48, 49). Thus,
it is possible that the ATR pathway inhibitors target a non-

kinase component of the ATM/ATR pathways to suppress
signal transduction. Further investigation to elucidate direct
molecular targets of these novel ATR pathway inhibitors is
ongoing, with a particular focus on target identiﬁcation for
MARPIN using structure–activity relationship studies and
MARPIN-immobilized beads to pull down relevant binding
proteins (50).
In conclusion, a cell-based phenotypic screen yielded novel
ATR–Chk1 pathway inhibitors that are mechanistically distinct from typical kinase inhibitors and effectively sensitize
p53-deﬁcient cells not only in vitro but also in an in vivo
xenograft model. This phenotype-based approach has the
advantage that it can identify bioactive small-molecule compounds that could target any aspect of the ATR pathway, rather
than focusing only on ATR kinase catalytic activity. Importantly, these compounds that are not ATR catalytic inhibitors
will be useful as probes to better understand DNA damage
response pathways. Detailed characterization of the mechanisms of action will further elucidate ATR pathway function in
response to various types of DNA damage, and may identify
novel druggable proteins for cancer prevention and therapy.
