Abstract
Although studies of cell cycle perturbation and growth inhibition are common practice, they are unable to properly measure the activity of cell cycle checkpoints and frequently
convey misinterpretation or incomplete pictures of the response to anticancer treatment. A measure of the strength
of the treatment response of all checkpoints, with their time
and dose dependence, provides a new way to evaluate the
antiproliferative activity of the drugs, fully accounting for
variation of the cell fates within a cancer cell line. This is
achieved with an interdisciplinary approach, joining information from independent experimental platforms and interpreting all data univocally with a simple mathematical model of
cell cycle proliferation. The model connects the dynamics of
checkpoint activities at the molecular level with populationbased flow cytometric and growth inhibition time course
measures. With this method, the response to five drugs, characterized by different molecular mechanisms of action, was
studied in a synoptic way, producing a publicly available
database of time course measures with different techniques
in a range of drug concentrations, from sublethal to frankly
cytotoxic. Using the computer simulation program, we were
able to closely reproduce all the measures in the experimental
database by building for each drug a scenario of the time and
dose dependence of G1, S, and G2-M checkpoint activities. We
showed that the response to each drug could be described as
a combination of a few types of activities, each with its own
strength and concentration threshold. The results gained
from this method provide a means for exploring new concepts regarding the drug–cell cycle interaction. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Pharmacodynamics, intended in a broad sense as the study of
the efficacy of a drug in cancer or in cancer biological models, is
object of research from the molecular scale, focused on inhibition
of specific targets, up to large-scale tumor growth inhibition
in vivo. However, only simple relationships between drug concentration and growth inhibition are usually assumed, neglecting the
dynamics of cytostatic and cytotoxic effects and the complexity of
their dose dependence.

Studies of the proliferation of a cancer cell population are done
at an intermediate scale, distinct from the molecular level, because
the behavior of a group of cells is not a straightforward consequence of how a single (or “typical” or “average”) cell functions,
as studied in molecular research. This intermediate level is where
in vitro toxicity tests are done and “probabilistic” quantities, such
as the percentage of surviving cells, are measured. Noticeably, at
this level of the biological scale, cytometric techniques can provide
a large amount of data because they are specifically designed to
retrieve the frequency distribution of the cell content of specific
constituents such as DNA and to detect inter-cell differences
and heterogeneity. In a study of the cell population response
to anticancer drugs, the time course of percentages of cells in
G 1 , S, and G 2 -M phases is readily measured, and this can be
complemented by measures of DNA-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
and absolute cell count. However, each measure conveys only
one piece of information, which may be misinterpreted if taken
individually because different combinations of underlying cytostatic and cytotoxic effects can lead to the same result. The “macroscopic” variations of these measurable quantities are in fact
the result of superimposition of the effects of cell cycle block
and cell loss, their dynamics in the times before the measure,
and the proliferation of surviving cells. Thus, rough data depend
on, but do not provide a direct measure of, the activities of the
molecular networks regulating G1, S, and G2-M checkpoints, which
in turn are the results of complex molecular interactions studied
by systems biology.
We attempted to link the molecular and cellular biological
scales using a simulation approach (Fig. 1), entwining a detailed
model of cell cycle kinetics with models of cytostatic and cytotoxic
effects of drugs in each phase to simulate experimental results
(1–3). This simulation partly bridges the gap between the molecular and cellular levels, deciphering cell cycle percentages and any
other quantity measurable at the “cell population” level, in terms of
parameters that directly represent the global activities of G1, S, and
G2-M checkpoints, each governed by a specific molecular network.
The model incorporates inter-cell heterogeneity of unperturbed
and drug-perturbed proliferation as a key feature connecting the
two biological scales.
Although, at the present stage, the “model” is not intended
for prediction of results of future experiments, it supports data
interpretation and integrates all observations into a coherent
scenario to comprehend the response to treatment. We applied
our modeling approach on the measures taken with different
techniques after treatments with five “classic” anticancer drugs,
at concentrations spanning the whole range of drug efficacy,
and at several times after drug exposure. Specific comments
to cell cycle effects of each drug and possible connections to
molecular mechanisms of action were discussed in other publications (1–5). Exploiting the fact that the cell line, the experimental

Unraveling the Dynamics of Cell Cycle Checkpoints

Flow Cytometric Analyses
Cells were harvested and prepared for flow cytometric analysis as previously described (3). DNA histograms were analyzed as described (6).
BrdUrd pulse-chase analysis. Short-term perturbations were investigated by BrdUrd pulse-chase analysis: 30 μmol/L BrdUrd (Sigma), which
is an analogue of thymidine, was added to the cell culture during the last
20 min of treatment. After drug and BrdUrd washout, the cells were left in
drug- and BrdUrd-free medium for 6 ± 1 h.
Cytochemical preparations for flow cytometric detection of DNA/
BrdUrd and apoptotic cells were made as previously described (5).

Computer Simulation of Cell Cycle and Drug Effects

interaction(s) with molecular targets, signals are transduced to the cell cycle

plan, and techniques were the same, we were able to create a
database including data on all the drugs together, and we analyzed
the results synoptically to extract the general features of the
dynamics of G1, S, and G2-M checkpoint activities.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Drug Treatment
IGROV1 cells were maintained as previously described (3). Exponentially
growing cells were treated for 1 h with different drug concentrations of
doxorubicin (generously provided by Nerviano Medical Sciences), topotecan (generously provided by Glaxo SmithKline), paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers
Squibb), cisplatin, and melphalan (Sigma).
After treatment, the cells were washed twice with warm PBS and left in
drug-free medium for 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. At each time, cells from three
replicated flasks were detached, counted, then pooled and fixed as previously described (3).

The cell cycle mathematical model (Fig. 2) is based on the theory of agestructured cell populations (7–10), and the underlying equations (1) describe the time course of the variables N G1 (aG1 ,t), N S (aS ,t), and N G2M
(aG2M,t) representing the number of cells of age a in a given cell cycle phase
at time t. In practice, in each phase, the simulation follows the cohorts of
cells with the same age (±15 min) while they mature (by increasing their
age).
The drug effects were superimposed on the cell cycling model, using specific parameters describing cell cycle arrest or delay (cytostatic effect) and
cell killing (cytotoxic effect) in each phase.
Further details of the model are reported in Supplementary Methods.

Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis
We adopted a principle of parsimony for the best fitting of the experimental data with the fewest parameters. Minimal models with few parameters (such as a simple block in one or two phases) were initially
tested, then the number of parameters was judiciously increased until
satisfactory fits were reached, in keeping also with qualitative information on the presence or absence of cell loss and its monotonic dose
dependence.
Because we could not find a satisfactory function of merit for fitting together all the measures obtained with different techniques and precision,
and we wanted to take account of qualitative information too, we renounced to perform a standard nonlinear fitting and we adopted an integer
penalty score with the supervised trial-and-error fitting procedure described in detail in Supplementary Methods.

Figure 3. Dynamics of G1 blocking activity. G1 checkpoint activity was measured by the “probability of G1 block” (pBlG1; i.e., the probability that G1 cells are intercepted by
the checkpoint and remain in G1 instead of entering S phase). A, three-dimensional representation of pBlG1 versus time at low concentrations (mainly cytostatic):
melphalan (PAM), 10 μmol/L; cisplatin (DDP), 10 μmol/L; doxorubicin (DOX), 3 μmol/L; topotecan (TPT), 0.2 μmol/L; and paclitaxel (TAX), 0.05 μmol/L. B, threedimensional representation of pBlG1 versus time at concentrations near maximum checkpoint activity: melphalan, 100 μmol/L; cisplatin, 100 μmol/L; doxorubicin,

bands constructed including values simulating the data with 3% tolerance for flow cytometric percentages or 20% for cell count. D, pBlG1 versus drug concentration in the
24- to 48-h interval (long-term block). All dose responses were sigmoid and were fitted using Hill functions (continuous lines). Fit of very low parameter values (<0.2) was
not always good, but we do not introduce more complex functions to fit them precisely as they represent minor effects.

Results
Experimental data. The data set used for this study are reported
as Supplementary Table. It includes time courses of absolute cell
counts and cell cycle percentages and short-time pulse-chase
BrdUrd data. All treatments were on ovarian cancer cells (IGROV1)
in standardized conditions of exponential growth. For each drug,
doxorubicin, cisplatin, topotecan, paclitaxel, and melphalan, 1-hour
treatment with several concentrations was analyzed to span the
whole range of efficacy.
Time course plots of absolute cell number, %G1, %S, and %G2-M
for each drug were reported in Supplementary Figure, together
with their best-fit model.
Mathematical modeling. Mathematical modeling of unperturbed cell proliferation was done using a separate age structure
for G1, S, and G2-M phases. Drug effects, namely block in G1 and
G2-M, recycling from block, S-phase delay, and cell loss in each
phase, were each described by a distinct model parameter
(Fig. 2). All experimental data were fitted by the model, giving a
scenario of the response to each drug based on the time and dose
dependence of model parameters. BrdUrd experiments distinguish
the effects specifically occurring in cells treated in S phase (BrdUrd

positive), and the model can catch this additional level of complexity. Only for melphalan and topotecan, S phase–specific effects had
to be considered to explain the data (discussed in refs. 3, 5), whereas for cisplatin, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin, the simple time dependence of the effect was enough for fitting.
G 1 checkpoint activity. Figure 3 shows the time course of
checkpoint activity after treatment with the five drugs, as measured by the model parameter pBlG1 (i.e., the fraction of cells actually intercepted and blocked among those crossing the G 1
checkpoint between two experimental time points).
There were two bursts of G1 checkpoint activity in the time dependence of the parameters (A and B): one short-term, immediately after treatment (in the 0–6 hour interval), and the second after
24 hours. At suitable concentrations (B), we observed both kinds of
G1 block with doxorubicin and topotecan, only the short-term one
with cisplatin and only the long-term one with paclitaxel, whereas
G1 activity remained weak in melphalan-treated cells. Considering
cell kinetics, this first burst (0–6 hours) mainly involved cells treated in G1 and some that were in G2-M; no cell treated in S had time
to reach the G1 checkpoint in 6 hours. Thus, the results indicate
that cisplatin, doxorubicin, and topotecan were able to damage

cells in G1 and rapidly activate the G1 checkpoint. In contrast, G1
cells treated with melphalan and paclitaxel gave only a weak response, and most of them were able to proceed into S phase.
Figure 3 also shows the dose dependence of the short-term (C)
and long-term G1 block (D). All dose responses were sigmoid and
were fitted using a Hill function. Fitting the short-term block indicated a 10-fold concentration range before this effect reached its
maximum, whereas the long-term block gave a steep increase,
strongly suggesting a threshold concentration. Two, not exclusive,
explanations of the gradual increase of the short-term block are
possible. The first is that at increasing drug concentrations, more
and more cells were damaged enough to trigger the checkpoint.
The second is that the checkpoint is triggered at the beginning
of the increase, but the blocking activity is reduced by the presence
of cells exiting the block before 6 hours, possibly due to repair. In
this view, the efficacy of the repair is progressively lost as the concentration increases, but remains detectable over a wide range of
concentrations.
G2-M checkpoint activity. The model parameter pBlG2M represented the probability that the cells crossing G2-M checkpoint
were intercepted and remained blocked there instead of dividing
and entering G1 phase. In samples treated with low drug con-

centrations (Fig. 4A), G2-M blocking activity reached its maximum or near maximum in the first interval (0–6 hours),
decreasing and exhausting itself by 6 or 24 hours. When the
drug concentration was higher, the blocking in this phase became stronger and longer (Fig. 4B). With melphalan, the onset
of the block was delayed, indicating that cells treated in G2-M
or late S, which reached the G2-M checkpoint in the first 6 hours,
were not blocked. Instead, cells treated in earlier cell cycle phases,
reaching the checkpoint later, were blocked and >50% of cells
crossing G2-M continued to be intercepted there up to the end of
the observation.
With regard to concentration dependence, the fitting indicated
that in most cases, the long-term G2-M response was much steeper
than the short-term one (Fig. 4C and D), with different behavior
only in cells treated with topotecan.
S checkpoint activity. The model parameter associated with
the S checkpoint is the fractional reduction of the average DNA
synthesis rate (pDS) compared with untreated cells. Figure 5 shows
the time course and the concentration dependence of pDS.
At low concentrations (A), S phase was not immediately delayed,
but after 6 or 24 hours, the DNA synthesis rate was reduced with
most drugs. At higher drug concentrations (B), DNA synthesis was

immediately reduced with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and topotecan,
whereas the short-term S-response remained weak for melphalan
and paclitaxel. S-phase checkpoint activity was sustained after 24
hours with all drugs.
The shape of the concentration dependence of this parameter
(C and D) was similar to that observed for pBlG1 and pBlG2M,
with a gradual dose-dependent increase at short times after
treatment, and a steep dose response 24 hours from the end
of treatment.
Order of checkpoint activation. Table 1 shows the threshold
concentrations necessary to trigger G1/S/G2-M responses, the 4 panels reporting the responses 0 to 6, 6 to 24, 24 to 48, and 48 to 72
hours after treatment. This enabled us to follow the order in which
the different responses were activated, from sublethal to lethal
drug concentrations.
Sublethal (<10 μmol/L) cisplatin concentrations immediately
activated the checkpoints in all phases (A), then cells probably
repaired their damage before division because no cell kill was
observed. Much higher concentrations of cisplatin were required
to sustain the response for >24 hours in S and G2-M (C and D). Cell
kill occurred at the same concentrations.
Melphalan triggered short-term G2-M block and persistent S delay at sublethal concentrations (between 5 and 10 μmol/L), but
these responses were selective for BrdUrd-negative cells, whereas

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (12). June 15, 2009

BrdUrd-positive cells were not delayed. At moderately lethal concentrations (20–40 μmol/L), long-term G2-M block and S delay
were active (C and D). Very high concentrations (>100 μmol/L)
were required to trigger a G1-S short-term response, and long-term
G1 block was never observed.
With paclitaxel, a short-term G2-M block was triggered at very
low concentrations (<0.01 μmol/L; A). At higher but still sublethal
concentrations (0.02–0.05 μmol/L), a G1 block and an S delay were
also triggered, which, differently from G2-M, persisted for a long
time. At concentrations of at least 0.1 μmol/L, a G2-M block was
active between 6 and 48 hours and cell kill occurred.
In doxorubicin-treated cells, sublethal concentrations (<0.5 μmol/L)
only activated a temporary S delay and G1 block in the 6- to 24-hour
interval. Then, all main responses were activated in a short concentration range (1–4 μmol/L), producing moderate lethality.
Topotecan induced a short-term S/G2-M response at very low
concentrations (<0.05 μmol/L; A). The effects were restricted to
BrdUrd-positive cells. Then, at ∼0.1 μmol/L, S delay became
long-lasting and a long-term G1 block appeared. At immediately
higher but still sublethal topotecan concentrations (0.25 μmol/L),
we observed a short-term G1 block of BrdUrd-negative cells. Then,
at ∼1 μmol/L, cell kill came in play. At higher concentrations, we
observed additional cytostatic effects in both BrdUrd-negative and
BrdUrd-positive cells.

Unraveling the Dynamics of Cell Cycle Checkpoints

Discussion
We adopted an interdisciplinary approach to measure the dynamics of checkpoint activities, joining information from independent experimental platforms and interpreting all data univocally
with a simple mathematical model of cell cycle proliferation.
The model belongs to the class of age- and phase-structured
models with compartments of cells out of cycle (8, 9, 11, 12). Other
authors designed specific models of the anticancer therapy (13, 14),
some theoretical, others oriented to fit data, and some including a
modelization of cell proliferation through the cell cycle.
Data-oriented models were used to interpret tumor growth/regression curves (15), pulse-labeled mitosis (16), or flow cytometric
experiments (12, 17, 18). Several researchers used such models to
evaluate the response to treatment at different scales and with or
without cell age or G1-S/G2-M structure (19–24). Our data-oriented
modeling approach was initially developed as a tool to support a
more correct interpretation of flow cytometric DNA histograms,
where the presence of G2-M, but not G1, block can be easily detected and the heterogeneity of the response can be overlooked.
Despite several refinements, our model is based on the simple concept of cells flowing through cell cycle phases (of known duration),
which encounter a checkpoint where a fraction of them is stopped.
As we deal with age cohorts of thousands of cells, this fraction
gives the probability that cells are intercepted while crossing the
checkpoint, thus measuring checkpoint activity at a specific time.
In other words, the activity of a checkpoint is high when the probability to arrest cells is close to 1 (almost all cells crossing the
checkpoint are arrested) and low when it approaches zero. Then,
such stopped cells may reenter in cycle or die, with given probabilities. The computer program we use is a flexible framework
where the user can design simple as well as quite sophisticated
models, simulate the cell cycle proliferation, and evaluate outputs
corresponding to different kinds of experimental data.
The value of this descriptive approach is not only a correct data
interpretation. Modeling a phenomenon using parameters with a
clear biological meaning (the functioning of G1, S, G2-M checkpoints
in our case) leads to a quantitative understanding of the behavior of
specific “modules” (e.g., checkpoint networks) of the system, which
is beyond direct experimental observation capabilities.
We analyzed the results obtained with our model with five drugs
belonging to different classes of molecular mechanism of action.
The cell cycle effects of these drugs have been studied for a long
time now (25). Our results were not conflicting with most of the
literature on the cell cycle effects of the drugs, but describe together many of the phenomena in play, whereas other published works
often focus only on some of them. For instance, doxorubicin was
shown to produce cell cycle perturbations in all phases by several
authors, stressing G2-phase (26, 27), G1-phase (28, 29), or S-phase
effects (30, 31). However, previous studies lack in the description of
the time and dose dependence of these effects and how they combine, which is the aim of our work.
Comparing the five drugs, we found that it is possible to define a
few types of response. In general, the time dependence highlighted
two waves of checkpoint activity, one short term and the other
long term, in each phase. The dose response in most cases was
fitted well by Hill-type functions, consistent with the concept that
this kind of function may be a general form of response in complex
enzymatic systems (32). The overall response of each drug is made
up of the combination of these activities, which operate at different
strengths, and with specific drug concentration thresholds. However, we did not find a common phase sequence for checkpoint

activation, and in most cases, the response involved different cell
cycle phases, and more than one checkpoint may be sequentially
or simultaneously activated, depending on drug concentration
(33). These findings also suggest that individual cells undergo multiple checks in subsequent cell cycle phases. Thus, the association
between maintenance of cells in a single blocking phase and completion of the repair process may be less strong than was commonly
believed, eventually weakening the concept of checkpoint itself.
According to this analysis, statements such as “the drug acts by
blocking in phase G1, S, or G2-M” may be inadequate to describe
the response to a drug challenge. This does not mean to deny the
concept of phase specificity, but this study should help to take account of the complexity of the cell kinetics and of the dynamics of
checkpoint activities, avoiding too simplistic interpretation of experimental data (3, 34). Moreover, only a fraction of cells is intercepted and blocked at checkpoints, the others go further, and then
blocked cells repair and recycle with different rates, a fraction being eventually committed to death. Inter-cell heterogeneity of response has been a somewhat neglected issue in vivo [as recently
pointed out by Minchinton and Tannock (35)] and has been even

NOTE: Cell cycle checkpoint was considered activated when the related parameter (delay or block probability) was ≥0.2. The concentrations of activation were obtained by linear interpolation between
the highest experimental concentration where the effect was not observed (i.e., delay or block probability <0.2) and the lowest experimental concentration where the effect was observed (i.e., delay or block
probability ≥0.2). In case of different response of BrdUrd-positive and
BrdUrd-negative cells, both are reported, separated by a slash:

more neglected by researchers dealing with ideally “homogeneous”
cell lines in vitro growing in a homogeneous environment. How‐
ever, this is not really surprising, considering that in vitro, too, the
intracellular levels of a drug vary widely among cells of the same
culture (36), and so do cellular levels of proteins (37–39), including
those relevant to checkpoint functioning, repair, and apoptosis.
The probabilistic meaning of the parameters describing checkpoint activities reflects this heterogeneity in our mathematical
model. Different models can be drawn in principle to mimic the
heterogeneity in different mathematical ways, and other optimization procedures, such as EM methods and genetic algorithm, could
be used to mine these data, which were not yet explored. We hope
that public access to our database (Supplementary Table) will contribute to further theoretical investigations, stimulating the search
for alternative models to find meaningful characteristics of the response besides those emerging from the present study, reaching
new insights in these phenomena.
Although the reported measures of checkpoint activities should
be considered specific for IGROV1, there is no reason to believe
that cell cycle perturbations are any simpler with other cell lines.
Each cell line may use the same bricks to build up the drug response with different strength, or not use one brick at all if the line
is defective for important proteins of the associated network. Similar studies with other cell lines have qualitatively confirmed the

responses with IGROV1 (5) and revealed the contribution of particular molecular defects in each checkpoint activity (4).
This article addresses cell cycle responses to short (1 hour) drug
treatments. From here, more complicated issues can be addressed
on solid ground toward understanding dose-response relationships
with any drug scheduling, with drug combinations, and the transfer of these concepts to the interpretation of in vivo experimental
models. The model also offers a first step to connect the “cell population” level of research to the more microscopic molecular level.
The dynamics of checkpoint activity shown here constitute a
challenge for molecular systems biology to integrate molecular interaction schemes with quantitative descriptions of the activity of
the specific molecular networks.
