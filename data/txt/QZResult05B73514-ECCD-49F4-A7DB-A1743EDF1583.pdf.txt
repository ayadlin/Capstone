Abstract
HER2 overexpression in breast cancer confers increased tumor aggressiveness. Although anti-HER2
therapies have improved patient outcome, resistance ultimately occurs. PARP inhibitors target homologous
recombination (HR)-deﬁcient tumors, such as the BRCA-associated breast and ovarian cancers. In this study,
we show that HER2þ breast cancers are susceptible to PARP inhibition independent of an HR deﬁciency.
HER2 overexpression in HER2 negative breast cancer cells was sufﬁcient to render cells susceptible to the
PARP inhibitors ABT-888 and AZD-2281 both in vitro and in vivo, which was abrogated by HER2 reduction. In
addition, ABT-888 signiﬁcantly inhibited NF-kB (p65/RelA) transcriptional activity in HER2þ but not HER2
negative breast cancer cells. This corresponded with a reduction in phosphorylated p65 and total IKKa levels,
with a concomitant increase in IkBa. Overexpression of p65 abrogated cellular sensitivity to ABT-888,
whereas IkBa overexpression reduced cell viability to a similar extent as ABT-888. Therefore, susceptibility of
HER2þ breast cancer cells to PARP inhibition may be because of inhibition of NF-kB signaling driven by
HER2. Our ﬁndings indicate that PARP inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic strategy for sporadic HER2þ
breast cancer patients. Cancer Res; 72(18); 4796–806. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a
proto-oncogene that belongs to a family of 4 transmembrane
receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate the growth, differentiation, and survival of cells. Overexpression of the HER2 protein,
ampliﬁcation of the HER2 gene, or both, occur in approximately a 3rd of breast cancers and are associated with aggressive behavior in the tumor (1). This may be, in part, because of
activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway by HER2, which
enhances cell proliferation, invasion, and resistance to therapies (2–4). HER2 activation of NF-kB requires IKKa, and this
activation leads to an increase in cytokine and chemokine
expression, as well as an increase in invasive phenotype (3). In
addition, activation of NF-kB depends on PARP (5, 6). Targeted
therapy against HER2 has been shown to beneﬁt patients with
HER2þ breast cancer (1). However, a signiﬁcant number of
patients either do not respond or quickly relapse and exhibit
resistance to therapy. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are
needed.

PARP inhibitors have shown initial promise in clinical trials
for their single-agent activity in BRCA-associated breast and
ovarian cancers, based on synthetic lethal interactions between
PARP inhibition and homologous recombination (HR) repair
defects (7–9). This is because of the conversion of single-strand
DNA breaks into double-strand breaks in PARP inhibited cells,
which is normally repaired by HR. However, because BRCAassociated tumors are deﬁcient in HR, the double-strand break
persists and is lethal to the tumor cell. Normal tissues still
possess intact HR, which explains why minimal side effects
have been observed in these patients. However, very few studies
report the efﬁcacy of PARP inhibition alone in sporadic cancers, presumably because of their intact HR repair. Instead,
numerous trials incorporate PARP inhibitors because of their
ability to enhance the action of other DNA damaging agents.
Thus, the use of PARP inhibitors as part of novel therapeutic
combinations is currently under extensive investigation.
In this study, we unexpectedly observed exquisite susceptibility of HER2þ breast cancer cells to PARP inhibitors alone
independent of an inherent HR deﬁciency. HER2 overexpression itself was sufﬁcient to render breast tumor cells susceptible to PARP inhibition. The mechanistic insight of this
intriguing sensitivity is described in this report and involves
attenuation of NF-kB signaling driven by HER2. Our results
suggest that PARP inhibitors may be useful for sporadic
HER2þ breast cancer patients.

key DNA repair and NF-kB signaling proteins, such as BRCA1,
p53, p21, HER2, PAR, PARP, EGFR, p65, IkBa, and IKKa, as well
as the growth characteristics and their response to genotoxic
agents, was tested most recently on February 2012 using
Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and colony
formation assays. All experiments were carried out within
10 passages, and no cell lines were kept in culture for more
than 3 months after receipt or resuscitation. Cells obtained
from the ATCC were also initially tested by ATCC via cytogenetic analysis and STR analysis.

Cell viability was measured using the ATP Lite 1 step luminescence assay (Perkin Elmer) following the manufacturer's
directions. Details are provided in Materials and Methods.
Immunoﬂuorescence
To assay HR-mediated DSB repair capacity in breast cancer
cell lines immunohistochemistry for radiation-induced rad51
foci was evaluated as previously described (13, 14). Immunoﬂuorescence for HER2 expression in MCF7 HER2 tumor xenografts and H&E staining was carried out as previously
described (15).

Chromosomal HR-mediated repair analysis
MDA-MB-361 cells were transfected with DRGFP substrate
and stable integrant were selected with 2 mg/mL of puromycin
(Sigma) for 3 weeks. Puromycin-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded. Chromosomal HR-mediated repair capacity
was determined as described previously (12). Cells were transfected with either an empty vector, ISce-1 expression vector to
measure HR-mediated repair capacity, or a GFP expression
vector to measure transfection efﬁciency. %GFPþ cells were
detected by ﬂow cytometry. HR relative to total transfected
cells was determined by division of the %GFPþ cells from each
ISce-1 transfection by the % GFPþ cells from a parallel GFP
transfection. Details are provided in Materials and Methods.
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously
(13). Antibodies used are described in Materials and Methods.
HER2 knockdown
Endogenous HER2 was knocked down using SignalSilence
HER2/ErbB2 siRNA I (catalog no. 6283; Cell Signaling Technology). Scrambled siRNA (catalog no. 6568; Cell Signaling
Technology) was used as a control.

NF-kB transcriptional activity was measured using the NFkB Secreted Luciferase Reporter System (catalog no. 631728;
Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Tumor growth delay
Three- to four-week-old female NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice
were obtained from Jackson Labs and allowed a 1-week acclimatization period. Mice were anesthetized and supplemented
with 0.72 mg 17b estradiol pellets from Innovative Research.
After recovery from pellet implantation, 2.5  106 cells were
injected into the mammary fat pad. Once the tumors were
palpable (5 mm) mice were randomized into groups (n ¼ 8):
control and ABT-888 (100 mg/kg). ABT-888 was administered
twice daily by oral gavage for 34 consecutive days. Tumor size
was measured using digital calipers on alternate days and tumor
volume was calculated using the following formula: 1/2  length
 width2. Tumor size was measured for 35 days after which
mice were sacriﬁced. All animal procedures were approved by
the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (Animal protocol no. 101109241).
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed via ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni
post-test using GraphPad Prism version 4.02 (GraphPad Software). Data presented as average  SEM.

Figure 1. HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells are susceptible to PARP inhibition alone. A, ABT-888 with or without lapatinib reduces the colony-forming
ability of HER2-overexpressing BT-474 human breast cancer cells. Cells were seeded for colony formation assay and treated with 10 nmol/L lapatinib or
vehicle control. Sixteen hours after initial treatment, the cells were exposed to different doses of ABT-888 or vehicle control. Shown is the mean
survival fraction (SEM) from at least 3 independent experiments (P < 0.01). B and C, other HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells are also exquisitely
susceptible to ABT-888. Breast cancer cell lines were seeded for ATP lite 1 step luminescence assay (B) and colony formation assays (C) and exposed
to various doses of ABT-888 or vehicle control. As expected, the HER2 negative MCF7 and T47D cell lines failed to exhibit cytotoxicity to ABT-888. Shown is
the mean survival fraction (SEM) from at least 3 independent experiments (P < 0.01). D and E, HER2-overexpressing cells are susceptible to ABT-888
and AZD-2281 but not BSI-201. Cell viability was measured using ATP Lite assay after 24 hours treatment with various doses of ABT-888, AZD-2281, BSI-201,
or vehicle control. Both BT-474 (D) and MDA-MB-361 (E) were susceptible to ABT-888 or AZD-2281 alone but not BSI-201. Shown is the average fold change
in cell viability (SEM) from at least 3 independent experiments carried out in quadruplicate (  P < 0.01).

Results
HER2þ breast cancers are susceptible to PARP inhibitors
alone independent of steroid receptor or p53 status
We recently reported that cetuximab, which inhibits the
EGFR (HER1) signaling pathway, can generate a DNA repair
defect in head and neck cancer cells and subsequently induce a
contextual synthetic lethality with the PARP inhibitor ABT-888
(veliparib; ref. 13). We thus hypothesized that lapatinib, a dual
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that interrupts the HER1/HER2
growth receptor pathways, would generate a similar DNA

repair deﬁcit and induce susceptibility to ABT-888 in human
HER2þ breast cancer cells. Consistent with our hypothesis,
lapatinib indeed signiﬁcantly reduced HR-mediated repair
capacity in the well-characterized BT-474 human HER2þ
breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A; ref. 16). However,
unexpectedly, ABT-888 alone caused similar levels of cytotoxicity as the combination treatment of lapatinib and ABT-888
(Fig. 1A). A subtherapeutic dose of lapatinib (10 nmol/L)
alone, which was chosen to test for synergy with PARP inhibition, produced a 30% reduction in the survival fraction of
these cells.

Figure 2. Susceptibility of HER2þ breast cancer cells to PARP inhibition is
independent of a homologous recombination (HR) defect. HR repair
capacity was measured in BT-474 (A) and MDA-MB-361 (B) human
HER2þ breast cancer cell lines by assessing radiation-induced rad51
foci, a well-characterized marker for HR repair. Brieﬂy, cells were exposed
to mock or 4-Gy irradiation (IR) and subsequently subjected to
immunoﬂuorescence staining for rad51 foci. Shown is the representative
data of 3 independent experiments the % of cells (mean  SEM) with
rad51 foci (  , P < 0.01 compared with vehicle). Inset, representative
staining of a cell exhibiting rad51 foci (top) with the nucleus stained with
DAPI (middle). A merged image is also shown (bottom). C, chromosomal
HR repair capacity was directly measured in MCF7 and MDA-MB-361
cells stably expressing the DRGFP repair substrate. Forty-eight hours
after transfection with ISce-1 or control vector, cells were subjected to
ﬂow cytometry for GFP expression. Shown is the representative data of 3
independent experiments the %GFPþ cells (mean  SEM) (  P < 0.01
compared with vector control). D, ABT-888 does not induce an HR defect.
MDA-MB-361 cells expressing DRGFP were treated with 10 mmol/L of
ABT-888 or vehicle control. Eight hours after the treatment period, cells
were transfected with ISce-1 or control vector. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, cells were subjected to ﬂow cytometry for GFP expression.
Shown is the representative fold induction in GFP (mean  SEM) from at
least 3 independent experiments.

To further conﬁrm our observations that ABT-888 alone was
cytotoxic to HER2þ breast cancer cells, the effects of ABT-888
on cell viability (Fig. 1B) were assayed using ATP Lite 1 step
luminescence assay on four other HER2-overexpressing cell
lines of various steroid receptor (estrogen and progesterone,
ER/PR, respectively) and p53 status (Supplementary Table S1),
including MDA-MB-361, HCC1954, SKBR3, and ZR-7530 (16).
Intriguingly, all HER2þ breast cancer cell lines showed exquisite susceptibility to ABT-888.
Because assays of cell viability are often a measure of cellular
metabolic activity and not necessarily cytotoxicity, and
because PARP activity can change cellular levels of NADþ and
ATP (17), the effects of PARP inhibition in our assays may be
because of alterations in metabolic processes rather than cell
death itself. Thus, to validate PARP inhibitor-mediated susceptibility of HER2þ breast cancer cells, we used the gold

www.aacrjournals.org

standard cytotoxicity assay, the colony formation assay. As
shown in Fig. 1C, ABT-888 also signiﬁcantly reduced the
survival fraction of all HER2-overexpressing cells tested in a
dose-dependent manner but, as expected, showed minimal
cytotoxicity in non-HER2-overexpressing MCF7 and T47D cells
(P < 0.01). These results conﬁrmed our cell viability data that
HER2þ breast cancer cells are susceptible to PARP inhibition.
Thus, for the remainder of our susceptibility experiments, we
utilized the ATP Lite 1 step luminescence cell viability assay.
To further assess whether susceptibility of HER2þ breast
cancer cells to ABT-888 can be generalized to other PARP
inhibitors, we next tested the efﬁcacy of BSI-201 (iniparib) and
AZD-2281 (olaparib), currently used in clinical trials, in BT-474
and MDA-MB-361 HER2þ breast cancer cells. Similar to results
observed with ABT-888, BT-474 (Fig. 1D), and MDA-MB-361
(Fig. 1E) cells were susceptible to AZD-2281 alone. However,
consistent with recent reports that BSI-201 is not a bona ﬁde
PARP inhibitor, HER2þ breast cancer cells did not exhibit
signiﬁcant cytotoxicity after BSI-201 treatment (18, 19). These
novel and intriguing results suggested that indeed, human
HER2þ breast cancer cells are susceptible to PARP inhibitors
alone independent of ER, PR, and p53 status.
HER2þ breast cancer cells do not possess an inherent or
induced HR-mediated repair deﬁciency
PARP inhibitors have been previously shown to target HRdeﬁcient cells (20–22). Our unanticipated and novel results of
susceptibility of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells to
ABT-888 and AZD-2281 as a single agent put forth the intriguing hypothesis that HER2þ breast cancer cells may possess an
inherent HR-mediated DNA repair defect despite not harboring
BRCA mutations. Thus, to assess the inherent HR repair
capacity of HER2þ cells, we ﬁrst analyzed rad51 foci, a wellestablished functional marker of HR repair activity (13, 14).
Because basal levels of HR repair are typically very low, radiation was used to create additional DNA damage and amplify
the HR response. As shown in Fig. 2, a robust induction in rad51
levels was observed in both BT-474 (72% after radiation treatment vs. 2.1% in control; Fig. 2A) and MDA-MB-361 (64% after
radiation treatment vs. 1.6% in control; Fig. 2B) cells (P < 0.01).
As a positive control, the HER2 negative MCF7 cells, which are
repair proﬁcient, also exhibited robust induction in rad51 after
radiation (70% after radiation treatment vs. 6.8% in control;
Supplementary Fig. S2). This suggested that HER2þ breast
cancer cells do not harbor defects in HR-mediated repair.
To further substantiate intact HR-mediated repair in these
cells, we also directly measured HR using a GFP-based chromosomal HR repair assay (12). MDA-MB-361 cell lines stably
expressing the DRGFP HR repair substrate were generated and
transiently transfected with the ISce-1 endonuclease, which
induces a DNA double-strand break. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, GFPþ cells, indicative of HR-mediated repair of
the ISce-1–induced DSB, were sorted by ﬂow cytometry. As
shown in Fig. 2C, a signiﬁcant increase in GFPþ cells was
observed in ISce-1–transfected cells compared with vector
alone. As a positive control, the well-characterized MCF7
DRGFP cells (12), which possesses only a single integrated
copy of DRGFP, were also analyzed for chromosomal HR repair

capacity. These results reafﬁrmed that HER2-overexpressing
cell lines do not possess an inherent repair deﬁciency.
We next hypothesized that it may be possible that ABT-888
induced an HR deﬁcit as previously reported (21). As shown
in Fig. 2D, no signiﬁcant difference in HR capacity as measured
by the %GFPþ cells was observed after ABT-888. Thus, the
vulnerability of HER2þ breast cancer cells to PARP inhibitors
alone appeared to also be independent of an induced HR repair
deﬁciency.
HER2 overexpression itself is sufﬁcient to confer
susceptibility to ABT-888
Because the susceptibility of HER2þ breast cancer cells to
PARP inhibitors was not because of an inherent or induced HRmediated repair deﬁciency, we postulated that one mechanism
may involve HER2 itself, because HER2 negative cells maintain

resistance to PARP inhibition alone. To test our hypothesis, we
assessed cellular susceptibility to PARP inhibitors in MCF7
cells (non–HER2-overexpressing) engineered to stably overexpress HER2 (MCF7 HER2; refs. 10 and 11) and compared with
its isogenic control (MCF7 NEO; courtesy of Drs. K. Osborne
and R. Schiff). These cells have been previously shown to
express functional HER2 levels comparable to BT-474 cells
and, as typical of HER2þ cells, are sensitive to HER inhibition
with lapatinib and trastuzumab (Herceptin; refs. 10 and 11).
Similar to our previous results with "native" HER2-overexpressing cells, MCF7 HER2 showed exquisite susceptibility to
ABT-888 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A; P < 0.01).
However, ABT-888 showed no effect on MCF7 NEO breast
cancer cells. Similar results were obtained with AZD-2281
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). HER2 overexpression was
thus sufﬁcient to convert cellular susceptibility to these agents.

hours later, luciferase activity was assayed in BT-474 (A), MDA-MB-361
(B), MCF7 HER2 (C), and MCF7 NEO (D) cell lines. Shown is the average
fold change in reporter activity (SEM) from at least 3 independent
experiments carried out in quadruplicate (  , P < 0.01). E, ABT-888 alters
levels of proteins involved in NF-kB–mediated signaling. Exponentially
growing breast cancer cells were seeded and subjected to either
10 mmol/L ABT-888 or vehicle control. Protein lysates were harvested 24
hours after the treatment and levels of IKKa, phospho p65, total p65, and
IkBa were detected by immunoblotting. A dramatic reduction in IKKa and
phospho P65 levels with a concomitant increase in IkBa levels and no
alteration in total P65 levels was observed in the HER2-overexpressing
BT-474, MDA-MB-361, and MCF7 HER2 cells. No alternations were
observed in the non-HER2-overexpressing MCF7 NEO cells.

To further validate our hypothesis that HER2 overexpression conferred susceptibility to ABT-888, we transiently
silenced HER2 expression using siRNA and subsequently
assessed ABT-888–mediated cytotoxicity. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3C, a signiﬁcant (but incomplete) reduction in HER2 levels was observed 24 hours after HER2 siRNA
transfection in BT-474, MDA-MB-361, and MCF7 HER2 cells,
but not in control scrambled siRNA transfected cells. Similar
to our results with a subtherapeutic dose of the HER
inhibitor lapatinib, HER2 knockdown mildly reduced cell
viability of HER2þ breast cancer cells. Importantly and
consistent with our hypothesis, HER2 knockdown induced
resistance of BT-474 (Fig. 3B), MDA-MB-361 (Fig. 3C), and

www.aacrjournals.org

MCF7 HER2 (Fig. 3D) cells to ABT-888. No effect was
observed in non-HER2–overexpressing MCF7 NEO control
cells (Fig. 3E). Taken together, our ﬁndings support that
HER2 itself was sufﬁcient to confer susceptibility to ABT-888
in breast cancer cells.
NF-kB signaling is signiﬁcantly inhibited by ABT-888
NF-kB (p65/RelA), a key transcription factor that can
initiate prosurvival signals, is activated in many cancer cells
overexpressing HER2 (4, 23). A possible cooperation between
HER2 and NF-kB signaling in HER2þ breast tumor formation and resistance has also been previously reported (23,
24). Moreover, PARP and NF-kB have also been linked.
Speciﬁcally, PARP1 is a coactivator of NF-kB and is required
for its activity (5, 6). Thus, we hypothesized that 1 mechanism of ABT-888–mediated cell death may involve abrogation of NF-kB–mediated transcriptional activity. To test
this hypothesis, we utilized an NF-kB–driven luciferase
reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 4, addition of ABT-888
signiﬁcantly reduced luciferase activity by >95% in the
HER2-overexpressing cell lines BT-474 (Fig. 4A), MDA-MB361 (Fig. 4B), and MCF7 HER2 (Fig. 4C) but not in the HER2
negative MCF7 NEO cell line (Fig. 4D). These results conﬁrmed our hypothesis that indeed, ABT-888–mediated cytotoxicity corresponds to a reduction in NF-kB–mediated
transcriptional activity. Further support of PARP inhibitor-mediated suppression of NF-kB–mediated transcription
was found with reduction of levels of the NF-kB–regulated
protein c-Myc (Supplementary Fig. S4; ref. 25).
Because NF-kB transcriptional activity was signiﬁcantly
inhibited by ABT-888, we proceeded to verify whether key
proteins of the NF-kB–mediated growth pathways (p65, IKKa,
IkBa) were also altered by ABT-888. As shown in Fig. 4E, the
reduced NF-kB transcriptional activity corresponded with
reduced levels of phosphorylated p65, decreased total IKKa,
and a concomitant increase in the NF-kB inhibitor IkBa in
HER2-overexpressing BT-474, MDA-MB-361, and MCF7 HER2
cells. Importantly, no changes in the protein levels were
detected in MCF7 NEO control cells, further verifying the effect
of ABT-888 on NF-kB signals only in the HER2-overexpressing
cells.
If inhibition of NF-kB is an important mediator in HER2þ
breast cancer cellular susceptibility to ABT-888, we hypothesized that overexpression of p65 would induce resistance to
ABT-888. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5A to S5C, transient
overexpression of p65 resulted in increased NF-kB–driven
luciferase activity in HER2þ breast cancer cells. Consistent
with our hypothesis, this ectopic overexpression of p65 abrogated sensitivity to ABT-888 in BT-474 (Fig. 5A), MDA-MB-361
(Fig. 5B), and MCF7 HER2 (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, increased
NF-kB expression had minimal effects on cell viability or NFkB–driven luciferase activity in MCF7NEO controls (Fig. 5D
and Supplementary Fig. S5D).
Conversely, we hypothesized that overexpression of IkBa,
a regulatory protein that inhibits NF-kB, would reduce
cell viability of HER2þ breast cancer cells to a similar extent
as ABT-888. As expected, transient transfection of IkBa
reduced NF-kB–mediated luciferase activity (Supplementary

susceptibility of HER2þ breast cancer cells to PARP inhibition,
ectopic overexpression of IkBa induced similar levels of cytotoxicity as ABT-888 alone in BT-474 (Fig. 5E), MDA-MB-361

controls (Fig. 5H and Supplementary Fig. S5H). Interestingly,

augment cytotoxicity, further supporting the notion that ABT888–mediated cell death involved inhibition of NF-kB. Taken
together, susceptibility of HER2þ breast cancer cells to PARP
inhibition may be, in part, because of inhibition of NF-kB that is
driven by HER2.

ABT-888 delays growth of HER2-overexpressing tumors
in vivo
To validate our observed effects in vivo, we assessed tumor
growth delay in mice bearing orthotopic xenografts of the
isogenic pair of MCF7 HER2 or MCF7 NEO. This pair was
speciﬁcally chosen because our in vitro data not only point to
HER2þ breast cancer cellular susceptibility to PARP inhibitors,
but also that HER2 itself was sufﬁcient to confer this cytotoxic
response. Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
images of MCF7 HER2 and MCF7 NEO tumor xenografts are
shown in Fig. 6A. HER2 expression in MCF7 HER2 xenografts
was also veriﬁed by immunoﬂuorescence (Fig. 6B). As shown

overexpression itself conferred increased tumor aggressiveness as reﬂected by a more disaggregated and invasive
appearance on histology as well as the faster growth of MCF7
HER2 tumors in mice compared with MCF7 NEO. In addition,
administration of ABT-888 signiﬁcantly delayed tumor growth
of MCF7 HER2 xenografts (5-fold tumor growth delay in ABT888 treated, P < 0.01). No signiﬁcant tumor growth delay was
observed in MCF7 NEO after ABT-888 treatment. Thus, these
results validated the signiﬁcant cytotoxic response of HER2þ
breast tumors in vivo to ABT-888.

Discussion
PARP inhibitors have gained recent press because of their
unique selectivity against HR-mediated DNA repair deﬁcient
tumors, although maintaining minimal toxicity in HR-proﬁcient normal tissues (7–9). Despite the fact that the enrolled
patients were heavily pretreated and had poor prognoses, the

www.aacrjournals.org

tumor response rates were signiﬁcantly better than the
expected 20% or less with cytotoxic chemotherapy (8, 9).
Importantly, these agents were well tolerated and produced
minimal adverse events. However, this approach is only applicable to a small percentage of cancers, and much effort has
been undertaken to expand the utility of PARP inhibitors
beyond the realm of BRCA-associated tumors by combining
with agents that alter the DNA damage/repair pathways.
Indeed, PARP inhibitors have been reported to enhance cytotoxicity in sporadic tumors when combined with other DNA
damaging agents, such as with platinum-based chemotherapy
in breast cancer or with temozolamide in prostate and brain
cancers (26–28). However, our results from this study implicate
possible novel interactions of the PARP inhibitors ABT-888 and
AZD-2281 with HER2 and NF-kB signaling that may have
important therapeutic implications. Speciﬁcally, PARP inhibitors may be effective for HER2þ breast cancer patients to not
only improve outcomes but also maintain patient quality of life.
There have been several reports that suggest sporadic tumor
susceptibility to PARP inhibition alone (29, 30). The tumor
suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is frequently lost in cancer cells resulting in genomic instability and
subsequent altered radiation and drug sensitivity. It was shown
that tumors harboring PTEN mutations are susceptible to
PARP inhibition both in vitro and in vivo because of generation
of a DNA repair deﬁciency (29). However, the role of PTEN in
DNA repair is controversial. Recent studies in prostate cancer
cells indicate that PTEN did not regulate rad51 expression or
HR-mediated repair and did not confer susceptibility to PARP
inhibition. Thus, it seems that PTEN mutation may not be an
optimal biomarker for tumor sensitivity to PARP inhibition
(31). Our results are likely unrelated to PTEN mutations,
because the cells tested do not harbor PTEN mutations and
were HR proﬁcient (32–34). In addition, our results reveal for
the ﬁrst time a DNA repair independent mechanism of susceptibility to the PARP inhibitors ABT-888 and AZD-2281.
The micromolar doses of PARP inhibitors used in our study
are compatible with those in other published reports (35–37).
Speciﬁcally, for ABT-888, although pharmacokinetic studies in
a Phase 0 trial revealed that a single 50 mg dose yielded a peak
plasma concentration of 1 mmol/L (38), current clinical trials
are now utilizing ABT-888 at 400 mg twice daily. In addition,
our in vivo results in mice using 100 mg/kg twice daily suggest
the tumor effects of ABT-888 are achievable. Thus, we believe
the doses used in our studies remain clinically relevant.
We also report that HER2 overexpression at a level that does
not cause oncogene-induced senescence was sufﬁcient to
confer this susceptibility independent of HR defects (10, 11).
As HER2 overexpression is also seen in ovarian, stomach, and
aggressive forms of uterine cancer, such as uterine serous
endometrial carcinoma, it will be interesting to assess susceptibility to PARP inhibitors in these HER2-overexpressing
tumors (39–41). We are currently actively investigating this
question.
Our results also reveal that estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor status likely does not play a role in the sensitivity
to PARP inhibition, because susceptibility to PARP inhibition was observed in cells with various receptor status

(Supplementary Table S1). The outcomes seem to also be
irrespective of p53 status. This is not unexpected given the
recent report of both p53 dependent and independent mechanisms of cell death caused by PARP inhibition (42).
Intriguingly, sensitivity may be, in part, because of inhibition
of NF-kB–driven by HER2. Figure 7 depicts a simpliﬁed overview of the proposed pathway. HER2 activates NF-kB through
the canonical pathway involving IKKa, and knockdown of
IKKa has been reported to signiﬁcantly decrease transcription
levels of multiple NF-kB–regulated cytokine and chemokine
genes (3, 23). In addition, IKKa knockdown reduced formation
of HER2þ tumors in mice (4). These results suggest that
HER2þ tumors may possess an oncogenic addiction to NFkB signals for proliferation and survival. This is further supported by sensitivity of HER2þ breast cancer cells to the NF-kB
inhibitor velcade (43). These observations may then explain
our observation that HER2þ breast cancer cells are exquisitely
sensitive to PARP inhibition, because PARP inhibition also
attenuates NF-kB pathways. Studies to examine the mechanisms by which PARP regulates NF-kB–mediated transcription
are currently ongoing. In addition, a role of altered DNA
damage response cannot be ruled out, because an interaction
between ATM and NF-kB has been previously reported (44, 45).
However, our data supports an HR-independent mechanism,
because the HER2þ breast cancer cells used in our study are
HR proﬁcient as evidenced by robust induction of radiationinduced rad51 foci and by the GFP-based HR repair assay.
Interestingly, activation of NF-kB has been shown to block
apoptosis in HER2 expressing cells and thus may contribute to
tumor resistance. Speciﬁcally, therapeutic resistance to HER2targeted agents may be because of upregulation of NF-kB–
induced genes (2, 24). Thus, the combination of PARP inhibition with HER2-targeted therapies may delay the onset of
resistance and warrants further investigation.

Survival

Figure 7. A simpliﬁed model of the
proposed mechanism of HER2þ
breast cancer susceptibility to
PARP inhibition. HER2
overexpression confers oncogenic
addiction to NF-kB–mediated
signaling pathway. HER2 activates
IKKa, which in turn phosphorylates
and dissociates the NF-kB and
IkBa complex. IkBa is
subsequently degraded by the
proteasome, whereas NF-kB
translocates to the nucleus to
activate prosurvival pathways.
PARP is a coactivator of NF-kB and
thus inhibition of PARP abrogates
NF-kB–mediated transcription,
which subsequently inhibits the
oncogenic pathway to which
HER2þ breast cancer cells may be
addicted.

Recent negative results in clinical trials with BSI-201 (iniparib) have raised concerns about the usefulness of inhibiting
PARP as a therapeutic strategy (26). BSI-201 was initially
reported to possess PARP inhibitory activity by covalently
binding to the zinc ﬁnger of PARP1 (46). However, recent
reports suggest that its effects are unlikely to reﬂect PARP
inhibition and should not be used to guide decisions about
other PARP inhibitors. This is supported by our current results
of BSI-201 not having any effect on HER2þ cancer viability,
although the other 2 bona ﬁde inhibitors, AZD-2281 and ABT888, caused signiﬁcant cytotoxicity.
In summary our intriguing and novel results point to a
broader utility of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of breast
cancer beyond hereditary BRCA1- and BRCA2-deﬁcient types.
In addition, these observations suggest a DNA repair independent action of PARP inhibition. Further mechanistic studies
are thus needed to understand the full spectrum of cancer
types for which chemical inhibition of PARPs might be therapeutically beneﬁcial. Biomarkers to predict therapeutic
response to PARP inhibitors are also warranted, and HER2
overexpression may be one such marker. In addition, clinical
studies will be required to assess the efﬁcacy in vivo. Nonetheless, inhibition of PARP is indeed a promising therapeutic
approach that may ultimately maximize the therapeutic ratio.
