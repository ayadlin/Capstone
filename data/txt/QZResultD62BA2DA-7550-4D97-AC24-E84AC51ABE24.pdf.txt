ABSTRACT:
Beyond their ability to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis, the statins have pleiotropic
effects that include anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Statins
could have clinical utility, alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics,
in the treatment of cancer. The mechanisms that underlie the anti-tumor activity
of the statins are nonetheless poorly defined. No studies have analyzed how they
alter the tumor-associated leukocyte infiltrate, a central factor that influences tumor
stroma and cancer evolution. Here we used HER2/neu transgenic (Tg-neu) mice to
analyze the effect of lovastatin (Lov) on the inflammatory reaction of spontaneous
mammary tumors. Lov treatment of tumor-bearing Tg-neu mice did not alter growth
of established tumors, but significantly reduced the number of new oncogenic lesions
in these mice. Moreover, Lov inhibited the growth of newly implanted Tg-neu tumors
in immunocompetent but not in immunodeficient mice. We found that Lov enhanced
tumor infiltration by effector T cells, and reduced the number of immunosuppressive
and pro-angiogenic M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Concomitantly,
the drug improved the structure and function of the tumor vasculature, measured as
enhanced tumor oxygenation and penetration of cytotoxic drugs. Microarray analysis
identified a Lov-elicited genetic program in Tg-neu tumors that might explain these
effects; we observed Lov-induced downregulation of placental growth factor, which
triggers aberrant angiogenesis and M2-like TAM polarization. Our results identify a
role for lovastatin in the shaping and re-education of the inflammatory infiltrate in
tumors, with functional consequences in angiogenesis and antitumor immunity.

INTRODUCTION

3]; in contrast, massive accumulation of cells of the innate
immune system, particularly macrophages, is linked to
poor prognosis [4-7]. Tumor-associated macrophages
(TAM) nonetheless have contrasting activities, depending
on their differentiation state. Progressing tumors skew
TAM differentiation towards an alternatively activated
(M2-like) state that induces angiogenesis and aids tumor
cell evasion of antitumor immunity. In non-progressing or
regressing tumors, however, TAM tend to a classic, pro-

The progression or inhibition of a tumor is
intimately linked to the integration of complex signals
delivered from its microenvironment. Evidence indicates
that immune cells in the tumor vicinity are major
regulators of the outcome. Tumor infiltration by cells
of the adaptive immune arm is associated with good
prognosis in glioblastoma, colon and ovarian cancers [1www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inflammatory (M1-like) program that promotes adaptive
immune responses and tumor lysis [5, 6]. The ability to
regulate the type of inflammatory infiltrate as well as its
differentiation program is thus central to the way that
inflammation affects tumor evolution.
Given the strong influence of inflammation on tumor
biology, anti-inflammatory drugs are being screened for
antitumor activity. The statins are a family of inhibitors
of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase enzyme, which converts acetyl-CoA into
mevalonic acid. Since HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the
rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol
biosynthesis in the liver, it was thought that the major
clinical benefit of statins was to reduce cholesterol levels
in the bloodstream [8]; statins are thus in wide clinical
use for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular
disease [9]. Nonetheless, mevalonate is also the precursor
of isoprenoid compounds, which are substrates for posttranslational modification of many proteins involved in cell
signaling. Blockade of isoprenoid synthesis might explain
the pleiotropic effects reported for statins in extrahepatic
tissues, including inhibition of pathogen infection as well
as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities
[10-15].
Many studies indicate that statins might also
have anti-tumorigenic activity, including inhibition of
angiogenesis [16, 17] and direct cytotoxicity of tumor
cells [18-20]. Breast cancer cells bearing mutated p53
upregulate the mevalonate pathway to disrupt mammary
acinar morphology and promote tumorigenesis, suggesting
that statins can be useful for tumors with mutations in
this suppressor gene [21]. Although these studies and
some epidemiological analyses suggest a preventive
role for statins in human cancer, randomized clinical
trials indicate that statins are not potent anti-cancer
agents in monotherapy-based regimes (reviewed in
[22]). Statins can also potentiate other cytotoxic drugs
[23-25], however, which prompted a number of ongoing
phase I/II clinical trials to test whether statins improve
chemotherapeutic effectiveness of other anti-cancer drugs
in skin (NCT00966472), gastric (NCT01099085), prostate
(NCT01220973), and breast cancers (NCT00354640)
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). The mechanisms that
underlie statin synergy with cytotoxic drugs are diverse
and not fully known. Statins overcome tumor cell
resistance to cytotoxic drugs by targeting multidrug
resistance-associated proteins, and alleviate the secondary
effects of chemotherapy in kidney and heart (reviewed
in [25]). Recent evidence suggests that statins increase
penetration of cytotoxic compounds into the tumor by
regulating endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and
oxidative stress; this in turn normalizes tumor blood
vessel morphology, maturation and function [26]. Statins
nonetheless induce pericyte apoptosis in vitro [27]; this
apparent contradiction implies complexity in the way
statins alter the tumor vasculature.

Although a major pleiotropic activity of statins is
the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses,
the relevance of these statin-mediated effects in cancer
has not been studied in detail. Pravastatin was reported
to downregulate expression of pro-inflammatory and
pro‑angiogenic factors, which correlated with tumor
growth inhibition in syngeneic mice [17]. In experimental
models of autoimmunity and chronic inflammation,
statins provoke a shift in T cell polarization towards a
Th2 phenotype, and increase regulatory T (Treg) cell
differentiation and recruitment (reviewed in [14]. These
activities could be thought to have a negative impact
on the potential immune response to tumors, and thus
promote oncogenesis and tumor progression. Whether
statin treatment impairs immune function in tumor models
has not been reported.
We administered the natural statin lovastatin (Lov)
to transgenic FVB/N-Tg(MMTVneu) mice (Tg-neu),
which overexpress the HER2/neu proto-oncogene and
develop spontaneous mammary tumors. Compared to
tumor graft models, in which implantation causes tissue
damage and hence inflammation, Tg-neu tumors generate
an inflammatory response that better resembles that of
sporadic human tumors. Tg-neu mice develop an immune
response to neu antigen, which is functionally suppressed
as in human tumors [28]; the residual neu-specific T cell
repertoire can be reactivated to restrict tumor growth
[29]. We found that Lov treatment of tumor-bearing Tgneu mice did not alter growth of established tumors, but
significantly reduced the onset of new oncogenic lesions.
Lov inhibited TAM polarization toward a pro-tumorigenic
M2-like phenotype and increased T cell infiltration into
the tumor. These changes paralleled the stabilization of
tumor blood vessel structure; indeed, Lov treatment
reduced tumor hypoxia and enhanced doxorubicin
penetration into Tg-neu tumors. Expression profiling
identified a genetic program elicited by Lov treatment
in these tumors, which included downregulation of
placental growth factor (PlGF), an inducer of vasculature
abnormalization as well as M2-like TAM polarization in
tumors [30]. These combined Lov activities might create a
hostile inflammatory environment for the tumor, in which
antitumor immunity dominates over immune evasion,
explaining the reduced tumor multiplicity in Lov-treated
Tg-neu mice.

randomly assigned for treatment with vehicle (Vhcl) or
Lov as soon as lumps were detected by palpation (Fig.
1A). The Lov dose used (10 mg/Kg every 3 days, i.p.)
is comparable to that for humans treated with 40 mg/day
[31].
In this model, Lov injection did not affect growth
kinetics of primary tumors (Fig. 1B) or their weight
at endpoint (Fig. 1C) compared to Vhcl treatment.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed no differences in
the apoptotic cell fraction between Vhcl- and Lov-treated
tumors (Fig. 1D; TUNEL+ cells/field, 0.37 ± 0.01 Vhcl
vs. 0.29 ± 0.01 Lov, p = 0.7; n = 6/group). Although we
generally noted a slight reduction in the proliferating cell
fraction (phosphohistone H3; p‑H3+) in tumors from Lovtreated mice, these differences were not significant (Fig.
1E, F; p = 0.5, n = 6/group). Macroscopic lung metastases
were not detected in these mice.
Tg-neu-treated mice initially developed focal
adenocarcinomas; multifocal lesions nonetheless appeared

at longer latency periods. Although Lov treatment did
not impair growth of the primary tumor, it significantly
reduced tumor multiplicity (mean number of affected
glands/mouse) compared to controls (Fig. 1G). At 6
weeks after initial lump detection, 100% of Vhcl-treated
mice showed tumors in at least two mammary glands and
25% developed tumors in up to six; in contrast, 46% of
Lov-treated mice had only one affected mammary gland,
with a maximum of lesions in three glands (30% of the
mice). Treatment of sporadic mammary tumors with high/
medium Lov doses thus did not reduce tumor growth,
but precluded promotion of new oncogenic lesions in the
mammary gland.

Lovastatin potentiates tumor chemotherapy by
increasing drug delivery into tumors
Statins can enhance the activity of several cytotoxic
drugs, including the anthracyclins [25]. We thus tested

Lovastatin restores correct structure to tumor
vasculature

whether Lov intensified the chemotherapeutic activity
of doxorubicin (Doxo) in mice with spontaneous Tgneu mammary tumors. Tg-neu tumors treated with a
suboptimal Doxo dose (0.5 mg/Kg, twice weekly) or
with Lov alone showed rapid growth despite treatment
(Fig. 2A). Co-administration of Doxo (0.5 mg/Kg) + Lov
significantly inhibited tumor growth at levels comparable
to those found after 2.5 mg/Kg Doxo administration
(Fig. 2A). In addition, Doxo+Lov treatment significantly
reduced tumor multiplicity in Tg-neu mice (Fig. 2B).
The Lov-induced enhancement of Doxo
chemotherapeutic activity might be due to potentiation
of Doxo cytotoxic activity or to increased Doxo
perfusion into the tumor parenchyma. To explore the
latter hypothesis, we used high-performance liquid
chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection
(HPLC-FD) to analyze Doxo levels in extracts of tumors
treated with Doxo (0.5 mg/Kg) +Vhcl or +Lov, using
daunorubicin as an internal standard (Fig. 2C). Compared
to Vhcl treatment, Lov co-administration significantly
enhanced Doxo levels in tumors (Fig. 2D). Lov thus
increased chemotherapy efficiency by improving delivery
of this drug into the tumor.

Improved drug perfusion into tumors is associated
with changes in tumor blood vessel structure and
function; we thus tested whether Lov treatment affected
angiogenesis in our model. Histochemical analysis showed
clear differences in the number and morphology of CD31+
tumor blood vessels after Lov treatment (Fig. 3A). Vessels
in Vhcl-treated tumors were less abundant (Fig. 3B) and
their diameter was heterogeneous (Fig. 3C) compared
to those in Lov-treated tumors, which were longer and
thinner (Fig. 3C). Reduced vessel diameter in Lovtreated tumors compared to controls was also observed
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 3D, E).
Ultrastructural analysis of Vhcl-treated tumors showed
many of the phenotypic abnormalities of endothelial cells
(EC) described in other tumor models, including irregular
borders and discontinuities or gaps in the EC layer (Fig.
3F, G), which suggests EC hyperactivity. This contrasted
with the regular, continuous, tightly packed EC in Lovtreated tumors (Fig. 3H, I), which lend an appearance of
“smoothness” to the vessel lumen.

Lovastatin increases pericyte coverage and tumor
perfusion
Morphological irregularities in EC are often
associated to poor coverage by mural cells [32]. Staining
for CD31 and the intermediate filament nestin showed that
Lov treatment significantly enhanced mural cell coverage
(Fig. 3J, K). Analysis of tumor sections from mice
perfused with FITC-lectin showed that Lov treatment also
increased the percentage of vessels that double-stained for
lectin and CD31 compared to controls (Fig. 3L-N). Lov
treatment therefore improved tumor perfusion, probably
by increasing vessel stability and maturation.

Lovastatin improves tumor oxygenation
Enhanced perfusion and increased blood vessel
number should improve oxygenation of Lov-treated
tumors. Hematoxylin/eosin staining showed that tumors
from Vhcl-treated mice had large necrotic areas, which
were not observed in those treated with Lov (Fig. 4A).
Necrotic regions also showed enhanced autofluorescence
(Fig. 4A); the extension of these fluorescent areas was
significantly smaller in Lov-treated tumors (Fig. 4B).
“Blood lakes”, which are associated with impaired vessel
function and oxygenation [33], were usually found near
the necrotic areas (Fig. 4A, arrowheads).
To further study tumor oxygenation, Vhcl- and Lovtreated mice received injections of the hypoxia marker
pimonidazole (Fig. 4C). Pimonidazole-stained areas were

condition (Table S1, S2); 75% of the upregulated and 95%
of the downregulated genes were validated.
Gene ontology analysis of differentially regulated
transcripts predicted a number of biological processes
significantly altered by Lov treatment (Fig. 5A, B; FDR
<0.05). Lov-affected processes included oxidation/
reduction, which concurs with the changes in tumor
oxygenation, metabolism, including the downregulation
of the glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructokinase/
fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (pfkfb3) gene, as well as the
downmodulation of positive regulators of angiogenesis.
We found that Lov downregulated the placental growth
factor (plgf) gene, whose elevation is associated with
the abnormalization of tumor vessels [34]. Lov-induced
downregulation of PlGF was validated at the mRNA
(Table S2) and protein levels (Fig. 5C). VEGF mRNA
levels were comparable in Vhcl- and Lov-treated tumors
(Fig. 5D), suggesting that the Lov effect was specific for
PlGF expression.
To further study the PlGF-producing cell types in
the tumor parenchyma, we combined magnetic beads and
FACS to isolate the three major cell populations in Tgneu tumors, CD24+ tumor cells (luminal origin), CD31+
(endothelial cells) and CD45+ (hematopoietic cells). Lov
treatment reduced PlGF mRNA levels in all three fractions
(Fig. 5E), although this tendency was not statistically
significant in any case. These results suggest that Lov

Lovastatin downregulates PlGF expression in
mammary tumors
To identify unique gene expression signatures
responsible for Lov-induced vascular changes, we
performed microarray analyses with mRNA isolated
from tumors of Vhcl- and Lov-treated mice (n = 5/
group). Genes showing a ±2-fold difference and a
p‑value <0.002 were considered to be differentially
regulated by Lov. Based on these criteria, Lov treatment
upregulated 39 (Table S1) and downregulated 49 genes
(Table S2) compared to Vhcl; none of the differentially
regulated genes were significant at a false discovery rate
(FDR) <0.25. Based on their treatment-induced up- or
downregulation or on biological significance, we selected
28 genes for assay by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR
in a set of six independent tumors for each treatment

Lovastatin shapes the inflammatory infiltrate

downregulates PlGF by concerted inhibitory activity in
the parenchymal and stromal compartments.

Our results could explain the Lov effect on the
tumor vasculature, but not the reduced tumor multiplicity
associated with Lov treatment in Tg-neu mice (Fig. 1G).
This prevention of tumorigenesis might be due to Lovinduced changes in inflammation and immune responses,
two biological processes markedly affected by Lov
treatment (Fig. 5B). We used FACS to analyze infiltration
of Vhcl- and Lov-treated tumors by T (CD3+) and B cells
(CD19+), TAM (Mac3+), granulocytes (Gr1+), dendritic
(DC, CD11c+), natural killer (NK1.1+) and NK T cells
(NK1.1+/CD3+). Tg-neu tumors in control mice were
massively infiltrated by TAM (~50% of CD45+ cells) and
to a lesser extent by T lymphocytes (~30%; Fig. 6A). Lov

DISCUSSION

treatment significantly enhanced infiltration of T cells
compared to TAM (Fig. 6A), particularly CD8+ T cells
(Fig. 6B); Treg cell numbers were nonetheless unchanged
in Vhcl- and Lov-treated tumors, as determined by FoxP3
mRNA analysis (not shown). Staining of tumor sections
confirmed a significant increase in CD3+ cell infiltration
in Lov-treated tumors (Fig. 6C, D), which reversed the T
cell/TAM ratio in Vhcl-treated controls (Fig. 6E).
PlGF skews TAM towards a protumor,
proangiogenic M2-like phenotype, which triggers
angiogenesis and suppresses T cell-mediated immunity
[30]. Since Lov downregulated PlGF in our model
(Fig. 5), this treatment might also inhibit M2-like TAM
polarization. M2-like TAM have high levels of mannose
receptor-1 (MRC1/CD206), arginase-1 (Arg1), IL-10
and chemokines CCL22 and CCL17, whereas anti-tumor
M1-like TAM express high interferon (IFN)γ and IL-1α/β
levels; TNFα marks both M1- and M2-polarized TAM [6].
Analyses of purified tumor-infiltrating CD45+ cells
indicated that Lov treatment increased mRNA levels
for M1 markers, which was statistically significant for
IFNγ and IL-1β, whereas it downregulated M2-like
markers (with significant differences for IL-10, CD206
and CCL22; Fig. 6F). Lov treatment also reduced TNFα
mRNA, which concurs with the reduced TAM infiltration
in these tumors (Fig. 6F). CD206+ TAM number was
lower in sections from Lov-treated tumors than those from
controls (Fig. 6G, H), again indicating that Lov treatment
prevented TAM polarization to the M2-like phenotype.
Lov treatment thus increased effector T cell infiltration and
prevented tumor-mediated skewing of TAM, two factors
associated with enhanced anti-tumor immunity.

A tumor-associated inflammatory response boosts
incipient neoplasia acquisition of several cancer hallmarks,
including angiogenesis and evasion of the immune
system [35]. This inflammation is incongruous, since
the immune cells responsible for surveillance to prevent
nascent tumor development are co-opted to promote
them. Reprogramming the tumor-induced inflammatory
reaction to “immunological killing” activity could thus
present a barrier to tumor formation and progression.
Our results indicate that lovastatin is able to induce such
reprogramming in spontaneous mammary tumors in Tgneu mice.
Based on studies of numerous acute and chronic
inflammation models, the Lov-induced changes in
antitumor immunity in Tg-neu mice were unanticipated.
A general phenomenon in these models is the Lov-induced
shift from Th1 to Th2 responses (reviewed in [14]), which
leads to upregulation of immunosuppressive cytokines
(such as IL-10) and downregulation of those with antiviral
and antitumor activities (such as IFNγ). In Tg-neu mice,
however, Lov triggered IL-10 downregulation and IFNg
upregulation in CD45+ cells, suggesting a bias toward a
Th1 antitumor response. Statins are also reported to reduce
Th2 cytokine levels in several models of Th2-mediated
inflammation [36, 37]. The statins thus appear to promote
a shift in the dominant immune phenotype, from Th1 to
Th2 in autoimmune and acute inflammatory conditions,
and from Th2 to Th1 in Th2- and tumor-associated
inflammation.
Another striking observation in our study was the
distinct Lov effect on tumor infiltration by lymphoid and
myeloid cells. A consistent result of in vivo statin treatment
is a decrease in leukocyte infiltration into inflamed
tissue, through mevalonate-dependent and ‑independent
mechanisms [14]. In late-stage Tg-neu tumors, Lov
treatment did not alter total numbers of tumor-associated
leukocytes (not shown), but selectively enhanced
infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ and to a lesser extent, of
CD4+ and double-negative T cells. Lov also induced a
consistent, although not significant, reduction of TAM
infiltration into tumors; the mechanism that underlies this
differential Lov effect on leukocyte infiltration requires
further research. Some Lov-targeted molecules involved in
transendothelial migration, including certain selectins and
leukocyte integrins, participate in lymphoid and myeloid
cell diapedesis [38]. Lov might also alter the expression
of chemoattractants implicated in the specific infiltration
of myeloid or lymphoid cells; for instance, Lov enhances
specific infiltration of Treg cells into inflamed footpads
by upregulating CCL1 expression in endothelial cells [31]
as well as macrophage emigration from atherosclerotic
plaques by upregulating CCR7 [39]. Expression profiling
in whole tumors showed no Lov-regulated chemokines
(Suppl. Table S1, S2). In the CD45+ cell fraction, Lov

Lovastatin inhibits growth of newly formed
tumors only in immunocompetent hosts
Although Lov elicits a genetic program that fosters
antitumor immunity, this treatment did not affect growth
kinetics of established Tg-neu tumors (Fig. 1B). Tumor
multiplicity was nonetheless reduced (Fig. 1G), suggesting
that Lov treatment prevents growth of newly-formed
tumors. To mimic this condition, we generated tumors
by injecting the syngeneic N202.1A mammary tumor cell
line into Tg-neu mice, and Lov treatment was initiated the
same day. In this model, Lov administration significantly
inhibited tumor growth kinetics as well as final tumor
weight (Fig. 7A, B). As for spontaneous mammary tumors,
Lov enhanced T cell infiltration into N202.1A-induced
tumors (Fig. 7C), thus increasing the CD3+ cell/TAM
ratio in Lov- compared to Vhcl-treated tumors (Fig. 7D).
N202.1A tumor growth kinetics was independent of Lov
treatment when cells were implanted in immunodeficient
RAG2-/- mice (Fig. 7E). This links the adaptive immune
system to Lov-mediated inhibition of N202.1A tumor
growth.

induced downregulation of CCL22, an attractant for Treg
cells [40]; however, we found no differences in FoxP3
mRNA levels between Lov- and Vhcl-treated tumors.
Parallel to Lov-induced enhancement of T cell
infiltration, we identified a role for this statin in TAM
polarization. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating CD45+
leukocytes showed consistent Lov-mediated upregulation
of IFNγ and IL-1β (M1 markers) and downmodulation
of IL-10, CD206 and CCL22 (M2 markers). Moreover,
microarray analysis showed Lov-induced downregulation
of chitinase 3-like 3 (Chi3l3, Ym1), a gene associated
to M2 macrophages [41]. This shift in macrophage
polarization in Tg-neu tumors contrasts with statin
potentiation of alternative M2 macrophage activation in
experimental glomerulonephritis models [42] and in the
vascular wall of patients with aortic aneurysm [43]. The
Lov effect on the TAM phenotype is nonetheless atypical;
Lov did not significantly alter IL-1α or IL-12 levels, which
are associated with M1 polarization, or those of Arg1 or CCL17, representative of the M2-like phenotype.
It appears that Lov treatment does not cause full TAM
reprogramming, but induces a specific genetic signature
that reduces TAM differentiation to the pro-tumorigenic
M2-like phenotype.
We propose that this M2-to-M1 shift in TAM
polarization is mediated largely by Lov-induced
downregulation of PlGF, a factor that drives TAM to the
M2-like phenotype in tumors [30]. Since PlGF is also
involved in aberrant tumor angiogenesis [34, 44], its
downregulated expression in Lov-treated tumors might
explain the improvement in perfusion and normalization
of blood vessel structure. These changes in tumor
vasculature indeed underlie the Lov-induced potentiation
of the Doxo effect in Tg-neu tumors, as indicated by
enhanced tumor parenchyma penetration by the cytotoxin.
Based on these findings, we propose that improved
vascular function and TAM bias away from the M2-like
phenotype are mutual feedback processes, linked through
PlGF downmodulation. Nevertheless, other Lov-induced
changes in the tumor environment, including increased
infiltration of immune effector cells, could contribute to
tumor vessel normalization and the reprogramming of protumorigenic TAM [45, 46].
An evident question is whether the Lov-induced
changes in the inflammatory response are relevant to
tumor biology. The combination of M1-biased TAM
and the increase in T cell infiltration could be predicted
to enhance antitumor immunity. The growth kinetics of
established Tg-neu tumors was nonetheless unaltered
by Lov administration, indicating that the effects are
insufficient to overcome the immune editing induced by
late-stage tumors. In contrast, Lov treatment effectively
reduced the number of new spontaneous tumors in
Tg-neu mice and inhibited N202.1A tumor growth in
immunocompetent, but not in immunodeficient mice.
We speculate that these alterations in immune system
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

polarity have a protective function, which would explain
the reduced tumor multiplicity in Lov-treated Tg-neu
mice. A recent study associated statin use with improved
progression-free survival in inflammatory breast cancer
patients [47]. The role of statins in the prevention of
human cancers is nevertheless debated [22, 48-50]. The
partially protective effect of Lov on tumor onset in our
murine model, suggests additional tumor mechanisms to
bypass this preventive activity.
In summary, our findings indicate that statin
treatment elicits a triple program that (1) improves
vascular function, hence increasing the penetration of
cytotoxic drugs into the tumor parenchyma, (2) enhances
CD8+ T cell infiltration into the tumor, thus altering the
effector:suppressor cell balance in the tumor stroma,
and (3) re-educates TAM to an M1-like phenotype,
which might rectify aberrant angiogenesis and create
an environment prone to antitumor immunity rather
than immune suppression. Our findings support the use
of statins in cancer therapy, particularly in combination
with immune-based strategies or drugs that induce
immunogenic tumor cell death.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture.
N202.1A mammary cancer cells, derived from a
Tg-neu tumor [51], were provided by Dr Vincenzo Bronte
(Verona University, Italy) and cultured as described [29].

Tumor induction and drug treatment.
FVB/N-Tg(MMTVneu) 202Mul/J (Tg-neu) mice
were from The Jackson Laboratory and Rag2-/- FVB
mice were described elsewhere [52]. Mammary tumors
in Tg-neu mice were detected by weekly palpation, after
which mice received a dose of Lov (10 mg/Kg, i.p.;
Sigma-Aldrich) or Vhcl (5% ethanol) 3 times/week for 6
weeks (until killing). Where indicated, Lov treatment was
combined with administration of doxorubicin (Doxo; 0.5
or 2.5 mg/Kg, 2 times/week, i.p.; Farmitalia Carlo Erba).
N202.1A cells were inoculated s.c. in the right flank of
the Tg-neu and Rag2-/- mice (0.5 x 106 cells); mice were
treated with Lov or Vhcl from the day of cell injection,
according to the schedule indicated above. Tumors were
measured weekly (Tg-neu) or twice per week (N202.1A)
with calipers and volume calculated (width2 x length/2).
Live animal experiments were supervised by the CNB
Ethics Committee, according to national and European
Union guidelines.

tumors.

each tumor was cut in half; one remained in the fixative
mixture and the other was cryoprotected with 30% sucrose
and frozen by immersion in dry ice-cooled isopentane.
Frozen tumor pieces were fractured by striking a sharp
blade placed on the specimen surface, then defrosted
by immersion in chilled PBS. Frozen and non-frozen
samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS
(1 h), rinsed in distilled water, dehydrated in an acetone
gradient, which was replaced with liquid carbon dioxide
and completely evaporated by critical point drying. To
enhance conductivity, samples were graphite-coated in
a high vacuum evaporator and then gold-covered in a
sputtering device. The vascular network was analyzed in a
JEOL JSM 6400 scanning electron microscope.

Cryopreserved tumor sections (10 µm) were
acetone-fixed and stained with anti-phospho-histone H3
(#06-570; Millipore), followed by an amplification step
with biotinylated secondary antibody and streptavidinCy3; 0.2% Triton X100 was included in all steps. For
TUNEL, sequential tumor sections were fixed with 4%
PFA (20ºC) and stained with the MEBSTAIN Apoptosis
kit II (MBL International).

Hypoxia analyses.

Doxorubicin quantification.

Necrotic areas were determined in sections (5 µm)
from tumors fixed with neutral-buffered formalin (SigmaAldrich) before paraffin inclusion. Images of hematoxylin/
eosin staining and autofluorescence, used for quantification
(ImageJ, NIH), were acquired in a Leica (DM RB)
microscope with a DP70 Olympus camera. Hypoxic areas
were detected by injecting pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe-1
Omni kit; Natural Pharmacia International) 30 min before
killing mice by cervical dislocation, followed by staining
with anti-pimonidazole antibody; hematoxylin was used
to counterstain. Images were acquired as above, and
quantified with Image-Pro Plus software. Tumor lactate
levels were measured with the Lactate Colorimetric Assay
kit (Abcam).

Tumor extracts (100 mg) were homogenized in 0.5
ml PBS with daunorubicin (625 pmol) as internal standard.
The homogenate (0.1 ml) was treated with 4 volumes of
cold acetone and the mixture kept at -20ºC for 150 min.
After centrifugation of the precipitated proteins (16,000 g,
10 min), the organic solution was recovered and acetone
evaporated under a nitrogen stream. The resulting residue
was dissolved in the mobile phase (0.2 ml) and injected
(0.1 ml) into an HPLC (Waters 2690 Alliance System)
coupled to a Waters 2475 fluorescence detector (480
nm (excitation) and 560 nm (emission) wavelengths).
Empower Software (Waters Corporation) was used for
instrument control and data acquisition and processing.
Molecules were separated on a C18 reverse-phase column
(Kromasil 100 C18 15 x 0.4 cm, 0.5 µm; Teknokroma),
with a 22:78 acetonitrile:water mixture, both containing
0.2% formic acid and 0.2% ammonium formate, as the
mobile phase. Chromatographic areas corresponding
to Doxo were compared to those of daunorubicin,
and amounts were calculated from a calibration curve
constructed by mixing different Doxo amounts (5, 10, 20,
40 and 80 pmol) with a fixed quantity of daunorubicin (40
pmol).

Tumor perfusion and blood vessel parameters.
Tumor-bearing mice were injected (i.v.) with FITClectin (100 µg; Vector Laboratories), killed after 10 min,
and heart-perfused with 10% neutral-buffered formalin.
Tumors were snap-frozen in tissue freezing medium
(OCT; Jung) and 50 µm sections stained with anti-CD31
antibody (MEC13.3; BD Biosciences Pharmingen) and
analyzed with a Radiance 2100 confocal system (BioRad)
on an Axiovent 200 microscope (Zeiss). FITC-lectin+
and CD31+ vessels were determined with NIH-Image J
software. Pericyte coverage was analyzed by staining
with anti-CD31 and -nestin antibodies (ab6142; Abcam),
and colocalization (Pearson’s coefficient) determined with
ImageJ (JACoP plug-in). Vessel number and area were
quantified from anti-CD31-stained samples using ImageJ.

Microarray analyses.
Total RNA was obtained from Lov- and Vhcltreated Tg-neu tumors (n = 5/treatment) using TriReagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and further cleaned using
RNeasy (Qiagen). RNA quality was confirmed by
electropherogram analysis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer).
cDNA was synthesized from 4 µg total RNA using OneCycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents (Affymetrix)
to produce biotin-labeled cRNA. cRNA preparations
(10 µg) were fragmented (94ºC, 35 min) into 35- to 200base fragments. Fragmented, biotin-labeled cRNA (10
µg) was hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430
2.0 GeneChip array containing 39,000 transcript variants

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Mice were perfused transcardially with heparinized
saline (50 ml) and then with fixative (1% PFA, 1%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer; 100 ml) at a
constant pressure of 120 mm Hg. Tumors were dissected
out and immersed overnight in the same fixative (at 4%
PFA, 4% glutaraldehyde). After several washes with PBS,

from 34,000 well-characterized mouse genes. Each
sample was added to a hybridization solution containing
100 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, 1 M
Na+, and 20 mM EDTA with 0.01% Tween-20, to a final
cRNA concentration of 0.05 µg/ml. After hybridization
(16 h, 45ºC), each microarray was washed and stained
with streptavidin-phycoerythrin in a Fluidics station 450
(Affymetrix) and scanned at 1.56 µm resolution in a
GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G System (Affymetrix).
Raw intensity values were summarized and
normalized by the Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA)
algorithm [53]. After data processing, each probe was
tested for expression changes over replicates using
empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics [54]. To control
the false discovery rate (FDR), p-values were corrected
using the Benjamini-Hochberg method [55]. The FIESTA
viewer
(http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/FIESTA),
developed by J.C. Oliveros (CNB Bioinformatics Core
Facility), was used to visualize all microarray results and
to evaluate the numerical thresholds applied for selecting
differentially expressed genes. Original archives and
normalized intensity values are deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus database (NCBI-GEO; Acc. Code
GSE42787, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Functional
analyses of biological processes were determined by
Genecodis, which indicates the significantly enriched gene
ontology terms in the list of gene targets [56, 57].

Leukocyte infiltration was analyzed in Tg-neu
tumors digested (90 min, 37ºC) with collagenase P (1
mg/ml; Roche) and DNase I (100 µg/ml, Roche); cell
suspensions were filtered through a 30 µm cell strainer
and stained with anti-CD45 (clone I3/2.3), -CD19 (1D3),
-Mac3, (M3/84), -NK1.1 (PK136) (BD Pharmingen),
-CD3 (145-2C11), -CD8 (53-6.7), -CD11b (M1/70),
-CD11c (N418) (eBioscience), -CD4 (GK1.5) and -Gr1
(RB6-8C5) (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed by FACS
(Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter).
Immunohistochemistry was carried out in acetonefixed, cryopreserved tumor sections (10 µm) stained with
anti-CD3 (Dako), -CD11b (M1/70, Beckman Coulter),
-F4/80 (BM8, eBioscience) and -CD206 (MR5D3,
Serotec), followed by appropriate secondary antibodies or
streptavidin-Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were
counted and staining area determined with Image J. TAM
polarization was quantified as the percentage of CD206+stained area relative to that of F4/80+.

Statistical analysis.
Data represent mean ± SEM of replicate values
from independent experiments. Statistical significance
was calculated with the two-tailed Student’s t-test or
Mann-Whitney test for comparison between two groups.
One-way ANOVA with Dunnett post-hoc tests was used
for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered
statistically significant when p <0.05.

Quantitative PCR.
Cell populations from tumors were purified as
described [58]. Total RNA from total tumor samples or
tumor cell fractions was extracted with Tri-Reagent or
with the Easy RNA kit (Qiagen, when recovered cells
≤5 x 105) and used to synthesize the first cDNA strand
(High-capacity cDNA Archive Kit, Applied Biosystems)
using random primers. Genes selected from the microarray
analysis, and VEGF, cytokines, chemokines, and specific
TAM markers were quantified by qRT-PCR in an ABI
PRISM 7900HT System (Applied Biosystems) using a
SYBR Green-based reaction mix (FluoCycle; EuroClone);
β-actin amplification was used to normalize cDNA in
each sample and to calculate ∆Ct values. Unless otherwise
indicated, relative quantity (Rq) for each gene was
calculated as 2‑∆∆Ct relative to the sample with the lowest
expression.
