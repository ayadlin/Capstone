BACKGROUND: Influence of potential clinical prognostic factors on overall survival (OS), local progression-free survival (PFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (MFS) in patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer
treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HFX RT) with or without concurrent chemotherapy was investigated. METHODS: Three phase 3 and 2 phase 2 studies have been designed and executed with a total of 600
patients. HFX RT alone was given in 127 and HFX RT-chemotherapy was given in 473 patients. HFX RT doses were either 64.8 grays (Gy) or 69.6 Gy using 1.2 Gy twice daily, or 67.6 Gy using 1.3 Gy twice daily. Chemotherapy consisted
of concurrent carboplatin and etoposide in 409 patients and concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel in 64 patients.
Sex, age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), weight loss (>5%), stage, histology, interfraction interval, and treatment (the addition of concurrent chemotherapy) were investigated as potential prognostic factors. RESULTS: The
median OS, median local PFS, and median distant MFS times were 19, 21, and 23 months, respectively. Five-year OS,
local PFS, and distant MFS rates were 19%, 29%, and 35%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed
that only age did not influence OS and local PFS, whereas female sex, lower KPS, less pronounced weight loss, lower
stage, squamous histology, shorter interfraction interval, and treatment independently predicted better OS and local
PFS. Only age and treatment did not influence distant MFS, whereas histology was of borderline significance. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified independent prognosticators of treatment outcome. These results may have implicaC 2011 American Cancer Society.

Lung cancer is among the major health problems worldwide. The majority of patients have nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), and of them, the vast majority are diagnosed as locally advanced (stage III) and metastatic (stage IV) disease.
For such patients, radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy have mostly been used in the past.
Nowadays, only a minority of patients with stage III disease are treated with a combined modality approach incorporating surgery. The remaining majority is treated with either RT alone, chemotherapy alone, or with increasing frequency
in the past 2 decades, with combined RT-chemotherapy as the dominant approach in a curative setting. Although induction chemotherapy followed by a radical RT1-3 has been shown to be an improvement for a combined regimen, concurrent
RT-chemotherapy has also been shown to be superior to RT alone in clinical trials,4 including recent a meta-analysis.5
Finally, the data from 2 more recent meta-analyses6,7 clearly showed the superiority of concurrent RT-chemotherapy over
induction chemotherapy followed by radical RT.
To optimize treatment approach in stage III NSCLC, we have performed a series of prospective studies8-12 exploring
various aspects of concurrent RT-chemotherapy regarding total RT dose and dose per fraction, as well as timing and dose

of concurrent chemotherapy given during the course of
radical RT. Our results have helped establish concurrent
RT-chemotherapy as the standard treatment approach in
this disease.
In addition to investigation of various treatment
approaches to optimize outcome, identification of prognostic factors should be attempted because of their key
role in the treatment decision-making process, as the current therapeutic approach uses a risk stratification paradigm. Prognostic factors facilitate risk assessment and
guide decisions on whether to initiate therapy, including
also the influence they exert on the choice of therapy to
administer. The use of 1 or more of these factors, however, has become confusing, producing conflicting results.
In addition, some of prognostic factors may be significant
by random chance alone, as their importance is rather difficult to evaluate without verification in multiple studies.
It was shown in various studies that the characteristics of
patients can influence their clinical course,13,14 and it is
observed that the magnitude of differences in outcome for
categories of the strongest prognostic factors can be larger
than those for the type of therapy used in various
studies.15
Therefore, we underwent current analysis to identify
prognostic factors influencing outcome of patients with
stage III NSCLC treated with hyperfractionated (HFX)
RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy. We have
focused on clinical prognostic factors because they are
easy to observe and note. They can also be collected early
in the course of the disease/diagnosis, before we decide
upon the optimal treatment approach in this disease, as
well as easily monitored during the latter part of the
course of the disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Over a period of 10 years (1988-1998), a total of 600
patients were treated according to 5 prospective study protocols. Three prospective phase 3 and 2 prospective phase
2 studies8-12 were performed in adults with confirmed
stage III NSCLC, a Karnofsky performance score (KPS)
score of at least 50%, and no previous therapy. Exclusion
criteria included postoperative thoracic recurrence or a
history of any prior or concurrent cancer (except that of
the skin), unless the patient had shown no evidence of disease for >5 years; patients with malignant pleural effusion
were excluded as well. Uniform diagnostic and staging
procedures (medical history, physical examination, complete blood count, biochemical screening tests, chest radi-

ography, and computed tomography [CT] of the thorax
and upper abdomen were used; brain CT scanning and
pulmonary function tests were performed whenever possible), including follow-up schedules and procedures.
Exceptions to this were Study 1,8 where CT scans of the
thorax and brain and pulmonary function tests were performed when possible, whereas abdominal CT scan was
not a part of the initial evaluation and was performed only
in patients with recurrence, and Study 5,12 where eligibility criteria included KPS of 70%, and weight loss of
<5%. RT was administered with 6 to 10 MV photons
using linear accelerators. In Study 1,8 total RT dose was
64.8 grays (Gy), in Studies 2 to 4,9-11 it was 69.6 Gy, in
all these cases using 1.2 Gy twice daily fractionation, and
in Study 512 total dose was 67.6 Gy using 1.3 Gy twice
daily. The primary tumor was encompassed with a minimum 2 cm margin, as was the entire mediastinum from
the suprasternal notch to a level 6 cm below the carina
(upper and middle lobe lesions), or to the diaphragm
(lower lobe lesions); the ipsilateral hilum was encompassed with a 2 cm margin and the contralateral hilum
with a 1 cm margin. The ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa
was included in the treatment field only when the primary
tumor was located in the upper or middle lobe. The initial
target volume was treated with a minimum dose of 50.4
Gy (Studies 1-4) or 49.4 Gy (Study 5), after which the
RT field was reduced but still included all detectable
tumors (total dose, 64.8 Gy [Study 1], 69.6 Gy [Studies
2-4], or 67.6 Gy [Study 5]). The maximum dose of 21.6
Gy (Studies 1-4) or 20.8 Gy (Study 5) was planned for
the contralateral lung, 45.6 Gy (Studies 1-4) or 44.2 Gy
(Study 5) for the entire heart, 50.4 Gy (Studies 1-4) or 52
Gy (Study 5) for the spinal cord, and 60 Gy (Studies 1-4)
or 57.2 Gy (Study 5) for the esophagus. An interfraction
interval of 4.5 to 5 hours (short) or 5.5 to 6 hours (long)
was nonrandomly assigned to each patient, and under no
circumstances was it allowed to change from the shorter
interval to the longer interval or vice versa.
Details of chemotherapy were given in details in
original reports and in Table 1. These studies were performed after approval was obtained from the institutional
ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained from
all patients.
Patients were examined at regular intervals using
standard diagnostic criteria. Symptomatic biopsies were
not performed routinely, but were recommended if signs
of tumor persistence or recurrence were present. Restaging
at the time of any progression was performed using CT
scans of the thorax, brain, and abdomen; bone scan;

bones, whenever necessary, in addition to the previous
procedures.
Survival and relapse-free survival rates were calculated from the first day of treatment by the Kaplan-Meier
method. In calculating local progression-free survival
(PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (MFS) rates,
patients who developed either type of failure were considered at risk for the other endpoint and censored at the
time of last evaluation. Univariate and multivariate Cox
analysis was used to test the difference between outcomes
and to test for independent influence of potential prognostic factors on OS, local PFS, and distant MFS.

RESULTS
During a period of 10 years, a total of 600 patients with
stage III NSCLC were enrolled and treated in 3 phase
38,9,11 and 2 phase 210,12 studies at our institution. Overall survival (OS) for all 600 patients included a median
survival time of 19 months, and the 5-year survival rate
was 19%. Corresponding figures for local PFS were 21
months and 29%, respectively. For distant MFS, they
were 23 months and 35%, respectively.
Regarding various potential prognostic factors of
OS (Table 2), females did better than males (P < .0001),
but there was no difference regarding age (P ¼ .36).
Patients having a KPS of 50 to 60 fared significantly worse
than those with a KPS of 70 to 100 (P < .0001), as well as
did those with pronounced weight loss when compared
with those without it (P < .0001). Similarly, patients with
stage IIIA did better than those with IIIB (P < .0001).
Histology also influenced survival (P < .0001), with
patients having squamous cell cancer (SCC) having significantly better OS than those with other histologies,
whereas there was no difference between 3 non-SCC histologies. Interfraction interval also influenced survival,
Cancer

with patients being treated with the shorter interfraction
intervals (4.5-5.0 hours) faring better than those treated
with longer interfraction intervals (5.5-6.0 hours; P <
.0001). Finally, addition of concurrent chemotherapy to
HFX RT led to significantly better OS when compared
with HFX RT alone (P < .0001).
When influence of the same factors was investigated
using the local PFS as an endpoint (Table 3), the same
was found: significantly superior local PFS for females,
patients with KPS 70 to 100, patients without pronounced weight loss, patients with SCC histology,
patients with stage IIIA, patients treated with a shorter
interfraction interval, and those treated with concurrent
RT-chemotherapy. The same was found when distant
MFS was used as an endpoint (Table 4).
Cox multivariate analysis was used to identify those
potential prognostic factors that may have independently
influenced the 3 endpoints initially investigated. Of all
investigated potential prognostic factors, female sex, KPS
of 70 of 100, weight loss of <5%, stage IIIA, and short
interfraction interval independently predicted improved
OS, local PFS, and distant MFS. Administration of RTchemotherapy predicted superior OS and local PFS, but
not distant MFS, whereas histology predicted OS and
local PFS (favoring SCC), but was only a marginally insignificant predictor of distant MFS. The only potential
prognosticator that was not shown to influence any of the
3 endpoints was age. No significant difference between
patients <60 years and those 60 years of age in KaplanMeier and univariate analysis was observed, and consequently age was not entered into a multivariate model.

DISCUSSION
Prognostic factors are used to divide the population into
subgroups to realize the benefits of prognostic stratification,16 including improved medical decision making,17
improved personal decision making beyond the treatment

decision, more appropriate research design and analysis,
and more appropriate health policy development.18
However, there are inherent problems with integration and clinical application of prognostic factors. Existing literature is markedly heterogenous for several
criteria,19,20 and the quality of published reports is variable.21 The breadth of prognostic factors studied is extensive and growing, whereas the scope of prognostic factors
evaluated in individual studies is often inappropriate. Few
studies attempt to integrate newly described factors with
significant factors identified in earlier studies. Also, there
is still bias among researchers favoring survival over other
endpoints that may be important for patients and their
physicians. Finally, relatively little research has focused on
patients at time points beyond their initial presentation.
In addition to these, we clearly acknowledge that HFX
RT may not necessarily be a part of the standard therapeutic lexicon in locally advanced NSCLC. Also, there are
potential biases that exist in every single-institution effort.

2998

We designed this retrospective analysis to delineate
prognostic factors associated with the use of HFX RT in
locally advanced NSCLC to optimize therapeutic decision
making as an additional effort to our first prognostic factors analysis.22 In particular, the lack of contemporary
studies focusing on locally advanced (stage III) NSCLC
treated with RT-chemotherapy prompted us to undertake
current analysis because of the finding that concurrent RTchemotherapy is nowadays considered the standard treatment approach in this disease. However, 12 years elapsed
since the closure of the last study, during which many new
technological and biological advances became available and
in widespread use. It is not unreasonable to speculate that
they may have largely enabled better diagnosis/staging and
more efficient (better local control, less toxicity) treatment
outcome and therefore to question the use of HFX RT.
Age as a prognostic factor was occasionally evaluated
in studies using multivariate analysis, with conflicting
results. Whereas 2 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group

(RTOG) database evaluations23,24 showed that age >70
years is an adverse prognostic factor of survival, some25,26
did not find its influence, including 1 of our own studies,
which used 60 years as the cutoff point.9 Contrary to that,
our first analysis22 showed that age <60 years (vs >60
years) carried better prognosis, as we confirmed in our
previous study.9 Interestingly, subsequent analysis of
RTOG 941027 showed better survival for the elderly,
which subgroup analysis of the meta-analysis5 reconfirmed. In the absence of proven influence of increased
treatment-related toxicity and with the current lack of any
information suggesting that tumors may have different biological characteristics and clinical course in the elderly
versus the nonelderly, age cannot be considered as an important prognosticator in this disease; the current analysis
reconfirmed this finding.
Investigation of sex as a prognostic factor also
brought conflicting results. Whereas Cancer and Leuke-

Cancer

July 1, 2011

mia Group B (CALGB)25 and RTOG analyses23,24 did
not find its influence, another RTOG analysis in patients
with supraclavicular lymph node metastasis treated with
combined modality therapy showed that females had
improved prognosis.28 This was a consistent finding in
our own studies,9,22 including the current one. Again, it
may be that this prognostic factor can be considered as
weak, because of lack of any explanation as to why this disease can be easier to cure in female patients, although long
ago it was documented in noncombined modality studies29 that sex may have an independent influence on
survival.
Performance status seems to be the earliest recognized prognostic factor.29,30 Various studies, regardless of
the stage of the disease or treatment used, generally confirmed these observations. In particular, in 2 major data
analyses of RTOG using recursive partitioning analysis,
performance status was always the strongest

prognosticator that was used to develop classes.23,24 Performance status confirmed its leading role in predicting
survival in patients treated with RT and/or chemotherapy
in 1999 patients enrolled in several studies,24 although
not unequivocally.26,28,31 CALGB25 however, showed its
strong independent influence on survival, as did Firat et
al,32 a finding we have previously observed,8,9 including
in the current study. Its place among other factors is likely
to be the leading one.33
Another factor, which has frequently been evaluated,
is weight loss. Different cutoff values have been used, such
as 5% or 8%. Whereas Stanley et al30 identified weight
loss as an important prognostic factor in 5000 patients
with lung cancer, giving it universal meaning, some contemporary studies failed to observe this.25,29,31 However,
a majority did so,23,24,33 including our previous studies,8,9
as was the case with the current study.
Similarly to our previous findings,8,9 the current
study showed improved survival for stage IIIA patients.

3000

This can be seen as indirect confirmation of an earlier observation by Stanley,30 although a recent CALGB study25
surprisingly showed better outcome for stage IIIB
patients. As the authors rightly pointed out, inadequacy of
the current staging system and the stage groupings made
in recent staging efforts may be a large contributing factor,
as size and not the volume of the tumor and/or nodes was
included in designation process. In addition, tumor volume may actually be a more important means of investigating influence of T and N components and therefore
stage. It was clearly showed that both total tumor volume
and primary tumor volume26 can be considered independent prognostic factors of survival. However, in that
study26 other endpoints (local/regional PFS) were not
used to prove this relationship in a causal way, as improvement in local/regional level should lead to an improvement in OS. Contrary to that, Ball et al31 failed to show
an independent influence of T stage on survival in their
study.

Prognostic Factors in Stage III NSCLC/Jeremić et al

Whereas some26,28 showed no influence of histology, our study results are in agreement with those of
Werner-Wasik of RTOG,24 who clearly identified nonlarge cell histology as having better prognosis. In our
study, large cell carried poor prognosis, whereas overall
results of SCC versus non-SCC proved to be an important
finding. In another RTOG study,34 histology was related
to pattern failure. Adenocarcinoma had greater risk for
distant metastasis than SCC, similarly to our study,
although large cell carcinoma in our study fared even
worse. Also, they have shown that adenocarcinoma progressed at the primary site more often than either SCC or
large cell carcinoma, which is only partially in agreement
with our study findings. The RTOG study34 clearly called
for recognizing the importance of influence of histology
on treatment outcome and suggested separation of squamous cell carcinoma from both adenocarcinoma and large
cell carcinoma. Our study findings are in complete agreement with theirs, as SCC always achieved the best results,
except in distant MFS, where it was of borderline
significance.
Of treatment-related factors, we have investigated 2
that have shown their influence earlier. Interfraction interval was shown to be an independent prognosticator in this
series as well, confirming our previous findings.35,36 Contrary to our repeated findings, RTOG37 did not show an
influence of interfraction interval on treatment outcome.
However, the RTOG study suffered from serious shortcomings that we identified earlier.36 Actual interfraction
interval was used, being defined as the mean of all daily
interfraction intervals, irrespective of duration of each
daily interfraction interval; also, several chemotherapy
regimens were used, both concurrent and induction.
Patients with stage II were included as well, and no separate analysis was provided for them. No information on
the influence of interfraction interval other than on esophageal acute and late toxicity was provided, and only 3 pretreatment prognostic factors were correlated with 2
treatment-related (chemotherapy and interfraction interval) factors. Also, no information on the influence of
interfraction interval was made using a multivariate analysis for the HFX RT/chemotherapy group of patients
because of insufficient data. Finally and most importantly,
no information was provided on the influence of interfraction interval on local control, a vital part of this analysis, because interfraction interval should influence OS by
influencing local control first.
Concurrent chemotherapy was proven to be an independent prognosticator of survival in the current analy-

sis. This is in contrast with the findings of Ball et al31 and
Basaki et al,26 but is in agreement with the available data
from RTOG and CALGB,24,25 including findings of our
previous studies.8,9 This has recently been reconfirmed by
the outcome of a meta-analysis that showed a significant
advantage of concurrent RT-chemotherapy over RT
alone.5 Together with the findings of the 2 most recent
meta-analyses6,7 showing its superiority over induction
chemotherapy followed by RT, they established concurrent RT-chemotherapy as the current standard treatment
in this patient population.
One of the advantages of the current analysis is that
it not only included OS, as did other studies, but added 2
important endpoints, namely local PFS and distant MFS.
Results of multivariate analysis of local PFS mimicked
those of OS, and confirmed our previous findings,25
whereas in distant MFS the findings remained the same
with the exception of concurrent chemotherapy, which
lost its significance, and with histology becoming of borderline significance. Failure of concurrent low-dose daily
chemotherapy to achieve improvement in distant MFS
somewhat falls within expectations of its presumed lower
activity, as it was not expected to act on a distant but
rather on a locoregional level.
As far as our knowledge is concerned, the current
study represent the largest single-institutional study ever
published on prognostic factors drawn exclusively from
prospective studies in a well-defined cohort of patients
with stage III NSCLC treated with HFX RT with and
without concurrent low-dose daily chemotherapy. Our
results help better identify potential prognostic factors to
be used in clinical research and optimize treatment of
locally advanced NSCLC with RT-chemotherapy.
