Abstract
Targeting cancer cell metabolism is a new promising strategy to fight cancer. Metformin, a widely used
antidiabetic agent, exerts antitumoral and antiproliferative action. In this study, the addition of metformin
to 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in prostate cancer cells leading
to a severe depletion in ATP. The combination of the two drugs was much more harmful for cancer cells than
the treatment with metformin or 2DG alone, leading to 96% inhibition of cell viability in LNCaP prostate
cancer cells. In contrast, a moderate effect on cell viability was observed in normal prostate epithelial cells.
At the cellular level, the combination of metformin and 2DG induced p53-dependent apoptosis via the energy
sensor pathway AMP kinase, and the reexpression of a functional p53 in p53-deficient prostate cancer cells
restored caspase-3 activity. In addition to apoptosis, the combination of metformin and 2DG arrested prostate
cancer cells in G2-M. This G2-M arrest was independent of p53 and correlated with a stronger decrease in cell
viability than obtained with either drug. Finally, metformin inhibited 2DG-induced autophagy, decreased beclin 1 expression, and triggered a switch from a survival process to cell death. Our study reinforces the growing
interest of metabolic perturbators in cancer therapy and highlights the potential use of the combination of
metformin and 2DG as an anticancerous treatment. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2465–75. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Current treatments for advanced prostate cancer are limited, with drug resistance and toxicity requiring novel molecular therapeutics drugs directed against new cellular targets.
Alterations in cancer cell metabolism are intricately linked to
the principal hallmarks of cancer (1). The first tumor-specific
alteration consists of an increase in glycolysis, which is maintained even in high oxygen conditions (2). As a consequence,
most cancer cells use elevated amount of glucose for anabolic reactions and are more dependent on aerobic glycolytic

metabolism to generate ATP than on mitochondrial metabolism. These biological alterations present a major challenge
in cancer treatment, as exemplified by the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy
in hypoxic environment (1). Furthermore, the increased dependency on glycolysis for energy generation provides a biochemical basis to preferentially kill the malignant cells by
inhibition of glycolysis.
2-Deoxyglucose (2DG) is an inhibitor of glucose metabolism, because it inhibits hexokinase, the first rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis (3). It leads to intracellular ATP depletion
(4) and induction of autophagy, a cell survival process in
response to nutrient deprivation (5). Because of the tumor
dependence on glycolysis, 2DG has been considered as a potential anticancer agent and association of chimiotherapeutic agents and 2DG has been used successfully in mice (6).
Metformin is a widely used antidiabetic drug prescribed to
almost 120 million people for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It lowers hyperglycaemia by inhibiting hepatic glucose
production (7). Recently, numerous studies have shown that
metformin decreases cancer cell viability and tumor growth
in xenograft models (8–11). Furthermore, retrospective epidemiologic studies revealed a decrease in the incidence of
cancer in patients treated with metformin (12–14). Similarly
to 2DG, metformin inhibits the energy-sensitive signaling
pathway mTOR and affects cell metabolism. It hampers the
respiratory chain complex 1 in hepatocytes (15) and inhibits

oxygen consumption in colon cancer cells (9), which is consistent with the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation.
We decided to combine 2DG and metformin, two drugs
that target the two sources of cell energy and may represent
a major advantage over traditional chemotherapies. However, the effect of this combination on cancer cell metabolism and growth is presently unknown.
Here, we show that metformin and 2DG act synergistically
to induce a massive ATP depletion in prostate cancer cells. It
led to a stronger inhibitory effect on cell viability than the
drugs alone. When used individually, metformin arrested cell
cycle in G0-G1 and 2DG induced autophagy; their combination blocked cell cycle in G2-M and induced p53-dependent
apoptosis via the AMP kinase (AMPK) pathway. Finally, we
showed that metformin shifted the 2DG response from autophagy to apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. LNCaP and P69 cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 and PC-3 and DU145 in DMEM
containing 25 mmol/L glucose supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL
streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L glutamine at 37°C and 5% CO2.
The P69 cell line was derived by immortalization of human
primary prostate epithelial cells with SV40 T antigen (16). All
prostate cancer cells were a gift of Dr D. Mercola (University
of California-Irvine).
Chemicals. 2DG and metformin (Sigma Chemical Co.) and
AICAR (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.) were dissolved in
culture media. Z-Vad-fmk (R&D Systems) was dissolved in
DMSO.
Western blotting analysis. Cell lysates were prepared as
described previously (17). Immunoblotting was performed
with antibodies against caspase-3, P-AMPK, and P-S6 ribosomal (Cell Signaling Technology), LC3 (Novus), cyclin A
(Novo Castra), cyclin B1, p53, beclin1, BCL2, and HSP90 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and α-tubulin (Sigma Chemical Co.).
Cell cycle analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
Cells were resuspended in 200 μL citrate buffer [250 mmol/L
sucrose, 40 mmol/L trisodium citrate buffer (pH 7.6), 5%
DMSO]. Propidium iodide (32 μg/mL) solution was added
for 45 min in the dark at 4°C before fluorescence-activated
cell sorting analysis (Becton Dickinson).
Cell viability assay. Cells (3 × 103 per well) were incubated
in medium containing 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours later,
cells were treated with the indicated agents. After 3 d, viable
cells were counted after trypan blue staining or 2,3-bis[2methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt (XTT) assay was performed (8).
Cell transfection with RFP-LC3 construct and confocal
analysis. LNCaP cells were transfected with RFP-LC3 construct (a gift of Dr Colombo) using Lipofectamine 2000, treated with agents for 24 h, fixed, and analyzed by confocal
analysis at the C3M MicorBio Cell Imaging Facility.
Electron microscopy. Cells were fixed with 1.6% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer at room temperature

2466

and then for 16 h at 4°C. Samples were rinsed with the same
buffer and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and 1% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer for 1 h at
room temperature. Cells were rinsed with distillated water,
embedded in epoxy resin, conventionally processed for thin
sectioning, and observed with a JEM1400 transmission electron microscope (Jeol) equipped with Morada CCD camera
(Olympus SIS).
Determination of complex 1 activity and ATP concentration. Complex 1 activity was determined with the Dipstick
Assay Kit Mitosciences. ATP concentration was measured by
luciferase activity using the kit from Roche Applied Science.
Caspase-3 assay. Caspase-3 activity was fluorimetrically
measured in presence or not of Ac-DEVD-CHO (caspase-3
inhibitor). Enzyme activities were expressed in relative intensity per minute and per milligram of protein (8, 18).
Cell transfection and transduction. LNCaP was transfected with α1 and α2 AMPK siRNA (Invitrogen) or a control
siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The drugs were
added 48 h after the transfection. Cells were transduced with
2 × 102 plaque-forming unit adenovirus encoding the green
fluorescent protein gene (control) or p53. Forty-eight hours
later, cells were treated with either metformin, 2DG, or both.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed
using Student's t test and Mann-Whitney nonparametric test.

Results
Metformin hampers prostate cancer cell metabolism
and aggravates ATP depletion induced by 2DG. To determine whether metformin affects cancer or normal prostate
cell metabolism, we analyzed its effects on mitochondrial
complex 1 activity in LNCaP and the normal P69 cell line
(immortalized human primary prostate epithelial cells). Metformin decreased complex 1 activity by 70% in LNCaP cells,
whereas it had a modest effect in P69 cells. Rotenone, a specific inhibitor of complex 1, inhibited the activity in both cell
lines (Fig. 1A). When mitochondrial oxidation is impaired,
cells compensate and increase aerobic glycolysis to improve
their bioenergetics (19). In agreement, metformin accelerated
glucose depletion from medium more severely in LNCaP
than P69 cells (Fig. 1B) and consequently lactate concentration (one of the end products of aerobic glycolysis) augmented
by 73% in the culture medium of LNCaP compared with 28%
in P69 (Fig. 1C). These results show that, as a consequence
of complex 1 inhibition, metformin significantly increases
glycolysis in prostate cancer cells and to a lesser extent in
normal cells. To block this effect, cells were treated with
2DG, an inhibitor of glycolysis. 2DG (1 mmol/L) decreased
lactate production and prevented metformin-induced lactate production in LNCaP and P69 (Fig. 1C). Altogether, these
results suggest that metformin and 2DG inhibit the two main
sources of cellular ATP. This was indeed the case because
metformin and 2DG alone decreased intracellular ATP concentration by 60% in LNCaP and had a slight effect in
P69 (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the combination of the two drugs
robustly diminished ATP concentration by >90% in LNCaP

The Combination of Metformin and 2DG Induces Apoptosis

cells and ∼50% in other prostate cancer cell lines (DU-145
and PC3) but only by 20% in P69 (Fig. 1D; Supplementary
Fig. S1). These results show that metformin and 2DG initiate
a strong metabolic stress in prostate cancer cells compared
with normal cells.
The combination of metformin and 2DG exerts a deleterious effect on cancer cell viability. To determine if this effect on metabolism affects cell viability, we analyzed cell
viability by trypan blue staining using two concentrations of
metformin (1 and 5 mmol/L) and 1 mmol/L 2DG in LNCaP
and P69 cells. The combination of the two drugs induced a
95% inhibition of cell viability in LNCaP, whereas metformin
(5 mmol/L) and 2DG alone decreased cell viability by 70% and
37%, respectively (Fig. 2A). In P69 cells, metformin had almost
no effect whereas 2DG inhibited cell viability by 28%, and the
combination of the two drugs led to a small additive inhibitory effect compared with 2DG alone. Similar results were obtained using XTT cell viability (data not shown). These results
show that the combination of metformin and 2DG is very toxic for cancer cells but had few effects in normal cells.
To establish a direct relationship between the decrease in
cell viability and the inhibition of cell proliferation, cell viability was followed over 3 days after the addition of metformin and/or 2DG in LNCaP and P69 cells. We did not observe
any effect of the drugs alone, whereas the combination slightly decreased cell viability in P69 cells. By contrast, metformin
and 2DG alone similarly reduced cell viability compared with
control, and their combination decreased cell viability below
cell seeding density in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting
a massive cell death. These results show that the combina-

tion of metformin and 2DG displays strong antiproliferative effects. Furthermore, it establishes a correlation between
a strong metabolic stress and an important antiproliferative effect.
The combination of metformin and 2DG induces apoptosis via AMPK. To determine if the deleterious effect of
the combination of the drugs is due to apoptosis, we analyzed caspase-3 activity in LNCaP cells. Metformin or 2DG
did not activate caspase-3 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the combination of metformin and 2DG increased caspase-3 activity
and Annexin V–positive cells and initiated caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 3A, C; Supplementary Fig. S2A, B). As expected AICAR (control) induced a strong increase of caspase-3 activity.
Z-VAD-fmk (a pan-caspase inhibitor) abolished caspase-3 activity in cells treated with the combination of metformin and
2DG, as well as AICAR (Fig. 3A). We then analyzed the expression of major proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes by
quantitative reverse transcription–PCR using a dedicated
“apoptosis plate” (20). We found that proapoptotic genes
were upregulated after cotreatment with metformin and
2DG, whereas antiapoptotic genes were downregulated. In
accordance, BCL2 and GADD45 expression was abolished
or upregulated, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2C). To determine the implication of apoptosis, we treated cells with
the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, which had no effect
on cell viability per se and did not alter the effect of metformin or 2DG. Importantly, the caspase inhibitor prevented
the additive effect of the combination of metformin and 2DG
and restored cell viability to the level of metformin or 2DG
treatment (Fig. 3B). To examine if AMPK, the major energy

sensor kinase, is implicated in metformin/2DG-induced apoptosis, we analyzed the phosphorylation of AMPK. The combination of metformin and 2DG induced a stronger
activation of AMPK and a total inhibition of phosphorylated
S6 ribosomal (a marker of mTOR activity; Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S3) compared with the drugs alone, suggesting
a correlation between the level of ATP depletion and activation of AMPK. To determine if AMPK is involved in apoptosis
induced by the combination of the drugs, we knocked down
the α1 and α2 catalytic unit of AMPK (8). siRNAs partially
inhibited total AMPK-α and AMPK phosphorylation; however, this inhibition was sufficient to prevent caspase-3 cleavage and activity (Fig. 3C, D). To confirm the implication of
AMPK, we used compound C, an AMPK inhibitor (21), which
prevented the inhibition of PS6 ribosomal and inhibited caspase-3 cleavage (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggest that apoptosis induced by the energetic stress caused
by the combination of metformin and 2DG is mediated
by AMPK.
p53 regulates metformin/2DG induction of apoptosis.
We asked whether p53, which plays a central role in apoptosis (22), is required for metformin/2DG-induced apoptosis in
LNCaP cells. 2DG alone did not affect p53 protein level,
whereas metformin slightly increased its expression. Interestingly, their combination strongly induced p53 expression
(Fig. 4A). To determine the role of p53 in metformin/2DG-induced apoptosis, we measured caspase-3 activity in prostate

cancer cells deficient (PC3) or mutated (DU145) for p53. The
combination of metformin and 2DG did not affect caspase-3
activity in both cell lines, whereas staurosporine strongly induced it (Fig. 4B). Therefore, functional p53 seems to be important for metformin/2DG-induced apoptosis. To confirm
this role, we expressed wild-type p53 in DU145 and PC3 using
an adenoviral vector (Fig. 4C). The reexpression of p53 induced capsase 3 activity in PC3 and DU145 cells upon metformin/2DG treatment, whereas no caspase activity was
detected in cells transduced with the control adenoviral vector (Fig. 4C). Altogether, these results suggest that p53 is required for apoptosis induced by the combination of
metformin and 2DG.
Metformin/2DG treatment induces cell cycle arrest in
G2-M independently of p53. Because the decrease in cell viability induced by the combination of metformin and 2DG is
not entirely due to apoptosis (Fig. 3B), we asked whether cell
cycle was affected. LNCaP cells were treated for 24 h in the
presence of metformin or/and 2DG. Metformin or 2DG led to
a cell cycle arrest in G0-G1 (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the combination of metformin and 2DG led to the accumulation of
LNCaP in G 2 -M with 32% of cells arrested at this stage
(Fig. 5A). To determine if cells were arrested in mitosis (M),
we analyzed microtubules organization by confocal microscopy with α-tubulin antibodies but did not find accumulation of mitotic cells (data not shown). We then examined
the protein level of cyclins B1 and A in proliferating cells.

was performed. The results are expressed as

addition of the agents at day 1.

After 24 hours, cyclin B1 was slightly decreased by metformin, and was notably reduced in cells treated with the combination of metformin/2DG (Fig. 5B). Cyclin A was decreased
with metformin or 2DG and strongly affected in metformin/
2DG-treated cells after 24 hours (Fig. 5B). These results show
that, in addition to apoptosis, the combination of metformin
and 2DG blocked cell cycle in G2.
To test whether p53 is required for the G2-M arrest, cell
cycle was analyzed in DU145 and PC3. 2DG did not affect cell
cycle, whereas metformin induced a slight increase in the
percentage of cells in G0-G1 in DU145 and cells accumulated
in G2-M in PC3 (Fig. 5C; data not shown). Importantly, the

G2-M arrest in p53-deficient cells (Fig. 5C) and a decrease
in cyclin B1 expression (data not shown). In conclusion,
these results suggest that p53 is not required for cell cycle
arrest in G2-M.
To determine if this blockade is associated with an effect
on cell viability, we treated DU145 and PC3 with metformin

either drug with a decrease in cell viability of 75% and 51% in
PC3 and DU145, respectively (Fig. 5D). Although the effect on
cell viability was less important in PC3 and DU145 than in
LNCaP (75% and 51% versus 95%), our results show that

p53 was not required for the additive effect of the combination. These data suggest that the effect of the combination of
metformin/2DG may also be due to a G2-M cell cycle arrest
which occurs independently of the status of p53.

Metformin inhibits 2DG-induced autophagy. PC3 and
LNCaP cells induce autophagy as a survival response to
2DG (5). We assessed 2DG induced autophagy using different
approaches. First, we showed by electron microscopy that
2DG (20 or 1 mmol/L) induced the formation of autophagosomes (Fig. 6A). Second, 2DG induced the accumulation of
LC3 II, the autophagic form of LC3 (Fig. 6B; Supplementary
Fig. S4). Finally, following transfection of LNCaP with RFPLC3 construct, the formation of RFP puncta in cells treated
with 2DG was observed (Fig. 6D).
We then investigated the effect of metformin on the autophagic response. Unlike 2DG, metformin did not induce the
accumulation of LC3 II (Fig. 6B). However, interestingly,
the addition of metformin to 2DG led to a total extinction
of LC3-I and LC3-II (Fig. 6B), suggesting that metformin inhibits autophagy. To confirm this effect, we analyzed the expression of beclin 1, a major regulator of autophagy (23).
Cells were treated with 2DG and metformin (0.5, 1, and
5 mmol/L). Metformin decreased LC3 protein levels in a
dose-dependent manner and diminished beclin 1 expression
in cells treated with 2DG (Fig. 6C). Noteworthy, we observed
the same inhibition in PC3 cells (data not shown), suggesting
that this effect is not dependent of p53. We then visualized
the formation of RFP puncta, and in accordance with our
previous results, metformin decreased 2DG induced autophagy as measured by the quantification of cells with RFPLC3 positive dots (Fig. 6D). These results show that metformin
inhibits 2DG-induced autophagy and suggest that inhibition
of autophagy could trigger apoptosis in LNCaP cells.

Discussion
Metformin alone exhibits a strong antiproliferative action
in numerous cancer cell lines (8, 9, 11, 24), and 2DG by itself
sensitizes cancer cells to the action of radiation or chemotherapeutics agents (25–29). Here we show that the combination of the two drugs has a much stronger deleterious
effect than either drug. Combining metformin and 2DG
led to a drastic reduction of intracellular ATP through the
inhibition of the mitochondrial complex 1 and glycolysis.
Similarly, 3-bromopyruvate, which inhibits glycolysis and
mitochondrial respiration (30), inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth (31) and displays antitumoral action in liver
(32). However, its action on other cancers has not been proved
yet, and as an alkylating agent, it causes numerous side effects.
Metformin and 2DG have the clinical advantage of inducing
no adverse side effect per se, although metformin could very
rarely cause lactic acidosis (33).
Our study suggests that the induction of apoptosis is correlated with a drop in ATP. Indeed, metformin or 2DG induces a moderate decrease of ATP, a slight activation of
AMPK, and a modest decrease of mTOR activity compared
with the strong effect of their combination, which induces
apoptosis. In P69 cells, where the combination of the drugs
decreases moderately the intracellular ATP concentration,
cell viability was moderately affected. Therefore, in agreement with others, we propose that the ATP level regulates
the onset of apoptosis (34, 35). Furthermore, we make a con-

2472

nection between the metabolism-sensitive pathway AMPK
and apoptosis. The decrease in ATP concentration induces
apoptosis, and the inhibition of the “metabolic sensor” kinase
AMPK blocks caspase-3–dependent cell death. Such implication of AMPK in apoptosis has already been described for
AICAR, which mimics energy depletion and induces apoptosis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and pancreatic
β cells (36, 37). Induction of apoptosis is a major challenge,
because it may improve the effects of classic anticancer
agents. Noteworthy, ongoing clinical trial are currently testing the association of metformin and chemotherapy in breast
cancer (14), whereas others have concluded for a beneficial
effect of 2DG in combination with radiation in glioma (28).
Because we show that the combination of metformin and
2DG induces apoptosis and exerts an additive antiproliferative compared with either drug, we expect a more efficient
effect on cancer.
Although the combination of metformin and 2DG did not
induce apoptosis in p53-deficient cells, the combination of
the two drugs has a significant and additive effect on cell viability in these cells. This additive effect may be due to the
strong accumulation of cells in G2-M. Indeed, cell cycle arrest
(and more specifically G2 -M arrest) is associated with a
strong inhibition of cell viability. Thus, Adriamycin, a chemotherapeutic agent, induces a more stringent cell cycle arrest
in G2 than in G1 in synchronized cells (38). Noteworthy, the
G2-M arrest is the main molecular mechanism of action of
Taxol derivatives, the most efficient and most frequently
used chemotherapeutic agents in prostate cancer therapy
(39). G2-M is also characteristic of the induction of senescence (40), which is controlled by p53, but metformin and
2DG did not induce senescence in LNCaP cells (data not
shown).
We show in accordance with Di Paola and colleagues (5)
that 2DG alone induced autophagy in PC3 and LNCaP cells.
When cells are cultured in the absence of nutrients, a survival
process is induced to recycle essential metabolites such as
lipids and amino acids for fuelling their bioenergetic machinery (41). Here, we show that the addition of metformin to
2DG induces a shift from a survival process to cell death in
LNCaP and PC3 cells. In accordance with our observation,
inhibition of autophagy by ATG5 shRNA or chemical inhibitors results in tumor cell death by apoptosis in vitro and in
animal models (42, 43). Metformin induces a decrease in beclin 1 expression, a protein required for autophagy (44). Beclin 1, a tumor suppressor gene, overexpression reduces the
malignant phenotype and the ability for anchorage-independent growth in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (23). This role is in
contradiction with the effect of metformin, which reduces
beclin 1 expression and triggers apoptosis in combination
with 2DG. Thus, we suggest that beclin 1 has a survival function by blocking the onset of the apoptotic cascade and metformin is the trigger of apoptosis in cells engaged in the
survival response induced by 2DG. Similar conclusion has
been made in breast cancer cells in response to DNA damage
after downregulation of beclin 1 expression with shRNA (45).
Metformin as an activator of AMPK and an inhibitor of
mTOR should potentially induce autophagy. However, only

one study shows that metformin induces autophagy in cancer cells (9), suggesting that, depending on cell type, activation of AMPK is not automatically associated with the
induction of autophagy. Other activators of AMPK, such as
AICAR, do not induce systematically autophagy and are even
reported to inhibit autophagy (46).
Our observations highlight the importance of confirming
the antitumoral effect of the combination of metformin
and 2DG in vivo. Indeed, the remarkable efficiency of their
combination to affect cell viability by inducing apoptosis
and/or blocking cell cycle may have important implications
in the treatment of prostate cancer.
