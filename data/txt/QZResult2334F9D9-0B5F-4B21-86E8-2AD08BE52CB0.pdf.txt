Abstract
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignancy of stem cells with an unlimited capacity for self-renewal. MUC1
is a secreted, oncogenic mucin that is expressed aberrantly in AML blasts, but its potential uses to target AML
stem cells have not been explored. Here, we report that MUC1 is highly expressed on AML CD34þ/lineage/
CD38 cells as compared with their normal stem cell counterparts. MUC1 expression was not restricted to AML
CD34þ populations as similar results were obtained with leukemic cells from patients with CD34 disease.
Engraftment of AML stem cell populations that highly express MUC1 (MUC1high) led to development of leukemia
in NOD-SCID IL2Rgammanull (NSG) immunodeﬁcient mice. In contrast, MUC1low cell populations established
normal hematopoiesis in the NSG model. Functional blockade of the oncogenic MUC1-C subunit with the peptide
inhibitor GO-203 depleted established AML in vivo, but did not affect engraftment of normal hematopoietic cells.
Our results establish that MUC1 is highly expressed in AML stem cells and they deﬁne the MUC1-C subunit as a
valid target for their therapeutic eradication. Cancer Res; 73(17); 5569–79. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disorder of
hematopoietic stem cells that have an unrestrained proliferative capacity (1, 2). Patients with AML often achieve complete
remissions with induction chemotherapy; however, the majority relapse and succumb to their disease (3). The leukemic stem
cell (LSC) population is considered to be resistant to chemotherapy and responsible for disease relapse (2). LSCs have been
characterized by a CD34þ/CD38 phenotype and the capability of generating leukemia in immunodeﬁcient mice (4, 5).
Nonetheless, the leukemic CD34þ/CD38 cell population can
be heterogenous and include normal hematopoietic stem cells.
LSCs can also exhibit varying levels of CD34 and CD38 expression (6, 7). Moreover, AML-CD34 populations have been
shown to contain leukemia-initiating cells (8). For these reasons, a functional deﬁnition of leukemic engraftment in immunocompromised mice has been adopted to further deﬁne the
LSC population (7–9). Markers of LSCs, such as CD32, CD35,
the interleukin (IL)-3–receptor alpha chain and CD47, have

been identiﬁed on the basis of their selective expression in
LSCs compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells (10–12).
In addition, CD32 and CD35þ LSCs initiate AML in mice and
exhibit chemoresistance in vivo (12). Intermediate levels of
aldehyde dehydrogenase activity have also been incorporated
to distinguish CD34þ/CD38 LSCs from their normal counterparts that exhibit relatively higher levels of activity (13). These
ﬁndings have collectively supported the delineation of LSC
markers and have provided potential targets for selective LSC
treatment.
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a heterodimeric-epithelial cell glycoprotein that is aberrantly expressed in AML cell lines and primary
blasts from patients (14, 15). MUC1 is translated as a single
polypeptide that undergoes autocleavage into 2 subunits,
which in turn form a stable noncovalent heterodimer (16).
The MUC1 N-terminal subunit (MUC1-N) is the glycosylated
mucin component of the heterodimer that resides at the cell
surface in a complex with the C-terminal transmembrane
subunit (MUC1-C; ref. 16). MUC1-C includes a 58-amino acid
(aa) extracellular domain, a 28-aa transmembrane domain, and
a 72-aa cytoplasmic tail. The MUC1-C subunit interacts with
receptor tyrosine kinases at the cell membrane and localizes
to the nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors,
such as NF-kB and the b-catenin/TCF4 complex that have
been linked to transformation (17–19). Localization of MUC1C to the nucleus is dependent on the formation of homodimers
through a CQC motif in the MUC1-C cytoplasmic tail (20).
Accordingly, the cell-penetrating peptide, designated GO-203,
was developed that binds to the CQC motif and blocks MUC1-C
homodimerization and function (21). Treatment of AML cell
lines and primary blasts with GO-203 was associated with
increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), arrest of growth,

and induction of terminal differentiation (21). These ﬁndings
provided support for the MUC1-C subunit as a target for
inhibiting the self-renewal capacity of AML cells.
The present studies show that MUC1 is highly expressed by
leukemic CD34þ/lineage/CD38 and CD34/lineage cells
as compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells. We
show that the AML MUC1high, but not MUC1low, cells initiate AML in the NSG mouse model and that treatment with
the MUC1-C inhibitor depletes engrafted AML cells in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Isolation of AML cell populations
Bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples were
obtained from patients with AML as per an institutionally
approved protocol (Table 1). Mononuclear cells were isolated
by Ficoll density centrifugation. For assessment of MUC1
expression, CD34þ cells were isolated using the MiniMacs
CD34 Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). As controls, CD34þ
populations were isolated from (i) mobilized peripheral
blood stem cell products obtained from healthy donors and

(ii) bone marrow aspirates from patients with lymphoid malignancies without evidence of marrow involvement. For
in vivo experiments, CD34þ/lineage and CD34/lineage cells
were isolated from bone marrow samples from patients with
AML using ﬂow cytometric sorting (FACSAria). Lineage is
deﬁned as negative for CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, and
CD56.
Detection of MUC1 expression by ﬂow cytometry
AML CD34þ/lineage/CD38, CD34þ/lineage/CD38þ, and
CD34/lineage cells were analyzed for MUC1 expression by
multichannel ﬂow cytometric analysis. Normal CD34þ/lineage/CD38 cells were used as controls. Cells were incubated
with monoclonal antibody (mAb) DF3 (anti-MUC1-N; ref. 22)
or a control mouse IgG1 for 30 minutes, followed by secondary
labeling of the cells with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG for an additional 30 minutes. The cells were
then incubated with APC-conjugated anti-CD34, PE-Cy7–conjugated anti-CD38, or anti-lineage MAbs (CD3, CD14, CD16,
CD19, CD20, and CD56) and ﬁxed in 2% paraformaldehyde.

MUC1 Is a Target for AML Stem Cells

Stained cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry using FACScan
and CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences).
Immunohistochemistry
Cytospins of CD34þ cells were prepared after isolation using
anti-CD34 magnetic beads. Cells were stained with anti-MUC1
(MAb DF3) or goat-anti-mouse IgG using the Vectastain ABC
Kit (Vector Laboratories). The cells were then ﬁxed in 2%
paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and visualized by phasecontrast light microscopy (Olympus AX70 microscope) using
an oil immersion objective lens (100).
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis
Total cellular RNA was extracted in TRIzol reagent (RNeasy
Mini Kit) and dissolved in RNase-free water. One microgram
of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and PCR
ampliﬁcations were conducted in a programmable thermal
cycler. MUC1-speciﬁc primers (50 -TGTCAGTGCCGCCGAAAGAAC-30 and 50 -CAAGTTGGCAGAAGTGGCTGC-30 ) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers (50 CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-30 and 50 -CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-30 ) were designed to yield PCR products of 203 and 195
bp, respectively. Ampliﬁed fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels.
Assessment of donor/recipient chimerism following
allogeneic transplantation
CD34þ cells isolated from a female patient with AML
following sex-mismatched allogeneic transplantation were
analyzed by immunohistochemical staining with mAb DF3,
followed by FISH analysis with probes identifying the Y and X
chromosomes. Cells were then analyzed using the BioView
Duet automated scanning system. A total of 100 interphase
nuclei were scored.
FISH analysis
Cytospin cell preparations were ﬁxed by immersion in 3:1
methanol:acetic acid for 1 to 2 hours and stored at 20 C until
use. The cytospin slides were treated with pepsin (Digest-All 3;
Invitrogen) for 5 minutes at 37 C, followed by rinsing for 5
minutes at room temperature and dehydration in ethanol.
Appropriate commercially available FISH probes (Abbott
Molecular) were selected to detect the chromosomal abnormalities reported in cytogenetic analyses of the patient AML
samples (Table 1); for example, the mixed-lineage leukemia
(MLL) Dual Color Break Apart Probe was used to detect the
MLL rearrangement. The remainder of the FISH procedure was
conducted as described in the protocol provided with each
probe. Hybridized slides were examined on an Olympus BX-51
microscope equipped with appropriate ﬁlters and images
captured with CytoVysion (Leica) imaging software. One hundred nuclei were scored, except where indicated, for each
specimen.
Leukemia engraftment by MUC1high and MUC1low AML
progenitors
CD34þ or CD34 lineage/MUC1high and lineage/MUC1low
cells were isolated from patients with AML by ﬂow cytometric

sorting. The cells were inoculated retro-orbitally (0.5–1  106
cells/0.2 mL/mouse) into sublethally irradiated (300 rads)
NOD-SCID IL2Rgammanull (NSG; 6-week-old female) mice
(Jackson Laboratories). After sacriﬁce, bone marrow and
spleen cells were harvested and the red blood cells (RBC) were
removed using RBC lysis buffer (Sigma). Engraftment, as
deﬁned by >1% human hCD45þ cells in the bone marrow,
was detected by staining cells with PE-conjugated anti-hCD45
and, as a control, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse mCD45. In
certain experiments, the cells were also analyzed for hCD34,
hCD11C, hCD19, or hCD20 by multichannel ﬂow cytometry
using CellQuest or Diva software. Cell populations were then
isolated using ﬂow cytometric sorting (FACSAria) and the
preparation of cytospins for morphologic assessment and FISH
analysis.
GO-203 treatment of NSG mice
In a prevention model, CD34þ/lineage/MUC1high and
CD34/lineage/MUC1low cells were inoculated (0.5–1  106
cells/0.2 mL/mouse) into sublethally irradiated (300 rads) NSG
mice. After 24 hours, the mice were injected subcutaneously
every 24 hours with PBS or 14 mg/kg GO-203 for 21 days. The
mice were sacriﬁced at 8 to 9 weeks after completing treatment. Leukemia cells were detected by dual staining for hCD45
and mCD45 by ﬂow cytometric analysis. In a treatment model,
mice were inoculated with MUC1high- and MUC1low-AML
progenitors. Treatment with GO-203 was initiated on day 60
after inoculation when circulating hCD45þ cells were detected
by ﬂow cytometric analysis. The mice were then injected
subcutaneously every 24 hours with PBS or 14 mg/kg GO203 for 21 days. Bone marrow and spleen cells were analyzed as
described above.

Results
Expression of MUC1 by AML CD34þ cells
AML blasts obtained from a patient with approximately 90%
involvement of the bone marrow were analyzed for MUC1 and
CD34 expression. As determined by ﬂow cytometry, MUC1 and
CD34 were coexpressed in 65% of the blasts (Fig. 1A, left). In
comparison, a similar analysis of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells from a normal donor showed that 2% of cells
coexpress MUC1 and CD34 (Fig. 1A, right). These ﬁndings were
conﬁrmed by immunohistochemical analysis of these cells for
MUC1 expression, which showed staining of the AML-CD34þ
and not the normal CD34þ, cell populations (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, analysis by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR conﬁrmed
prominent expression of MUC1 in the AML-CD34þ cells and a
low to undetectable level in normal CD34þ cells (Fig. 1C). On
the basis of these ﬁndings, we analyzed bone marrows from 20
patients with active AML for whom the clinical features,
cytogenetic proﬁles, and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Analysis of CD34þ/lineage/CD38 cell
populations showed that MUC1 is expressed in all of the
samples, ranging from 15% to 96% (mean 64%) for the individual patient cell preparations (Fig. 1D). Similar results were
obtained for the CD34þ/lineage/CD38þ cell populations (Fig.
1D). These ﬁndings were in contrast with those obtained with
CD34þ/lineage/CD38 stem cells from the peripheral blood

AML (left) and mobilized peripheral blood stem cells from a normal donor (right) were isolated with anti-CD34 magnetic beads and analyzed for
MUC1 and CD34 expression by ﬂow cytometry (A). The percentage of MUC1þ cells is highlighted in the top right. The AML CD34þ and normal CD34þ
cells were also analyzed by immunohistochemical staining for MUC1 (B) and by RT-PCR using primers for MUC1 and, as a control, GAPDH (C). D, AML
cells from 20 patients with CD34þ active disease were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry for MUC1 expression on CD34þ/lineage/CD38 and CD34þ
/lineage/CD38þ populations. Each symbol represents the individual patients. Peripheral blood stem cells from 7 normal donors and bone marrows from
3 patients with lymphoid malignancies without evidence of tumor involvement were also analyzed for MUC1 expression as controls. The results
are expressed as the percentage of cells that are MUC1þ, with the horizontal bars representing the mean percentage of MUC1 expression for the
different groups. E, CD34/lineage AML cells from 6 patients with CD34 active disease were analyzed for MUC1 expression. The results are expressed
as the percentage of cells that are MUC1þ, with the horizontal bar representing the mean percentage of MUC1 expression.

of normal donors and bone marrows from patients with
lymphoid malignancies without evidence of bone marrow
involvement (Fig. 1D). Studies have shown that leukemiainitiating cells are not restricted to CD34þ population and
have been identiﬁed in CD34 AML (8). Accordingly, we
analyzed CD34/lineage populations from 6 patients with
CD34 AML (Fig. 1E). Here, we also found that the CD34
/lineage cells express MUC1 (range 20%–92%; mean 51%).
These ﬁndings thus show that MUC1 is selectively expressed by
both CD34þ and CD34AML cells as compared with normal
hematopoietic stem cells.
Assessment of MUC1-positive leukemic cells in a
chimeric-bone marrow population
The selective expression of MUC1 by AML as compared with
normal hematopoietic cells was further assessed in studies of a
patient who had undergone an allogeneic transplant from her
HLA-matched brother. In the posttransplant recovery period,
CD34þ cells isolated from the patients' bone marrow were
analyzed for MUC1 expression. Flow cytometry of the CD34þ

cell population clearly showed the presence of MUC1þ cells
(Fig. 2A). In addition, RT-PCR analysis of the isolated CD34þ
population conﬁrmed the detection of MUC1 expression (Fig.
2B). To deﬁne the derivation of the MUC1þ cells, we used the
BioView Duet System in which isolated CD34þ cells were
analyzed by concomitant immunohistochemical staining for
MUC1 and cytogenetic detection of sex chromosomes (Fig. 2C).
Of the 100 CD34þ cells that were analyzed, MUC1 expression
was detectable in 41 cells, of which 39 were of female or
recipient origin. In contrast, 11 of 13 CD34þ cells identiﬁed
as of male or donor origin were negative for MUC1 expression.
The correlation between MUC1 expression and recipientderived cells was statistically signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.04). These
ﬁndings supported the premise that in the setting of posttransplant persistent disease, MUC1 expression differentiated
the recipient-derived leukemia cells (MUC1þ) from normal
donor hematopoietic stem cells (MUC1). In concert with
the presence of recipient-derived leukemia cells following
transplantation, this patient relapsed one month after the
above analysis.

Engraftment of AML CD34þ MUC1high and MUC1low cells
in NSG mice
The LSC population is deﬁned in part by the functional
capability for engraftment of AML in immunocompromised
mice (7–9). To assess the leukemia-initiating capacity of
MUC1þ AML cells, we isolated the CD34þ/lineage population from the bone marrow of patient #1 with AML, who had
blasts that uniformly expressed CD34 and sorted into
MUC1high and MUC1low cells (Fig. 3A). The MUC1high cells
were inoculated into NSG mice, which were then followed for
90 days. At that time, analysis of the bone marrow showed
the presence of human CD45þ cells (Fig. 3B, left). Furthermore, analysis conﬁrmed that the human CD45þ population
was also positive for CD34 (Fig. 3B, right). Assessment of the
isolated human CD45þ/CD34þ cells showed morphologic
characteristics consistent with leukemic blasts (Fig. 3C).
Similar ﬁndings were obtained in 4 of 5 mice inoculated with
MUC1high cells and the one remaining mouse had no evidence
for engraftment. Of the 4 mice with engraftment, human
CD45þ/CD34þ cells in the bone marrow reached a mean
of 33% of the total mononuclear cell population. In contrast,
of 5 mice inoculated with MUC1low cells, engraftment was
observed in 2 mice. One of the 2 mice had engraftment of both
human CD45þ/CD34þ and CD45þ/CD34 cells (Fig. 3D, left
and right). The other mouse had engraftment of only human
CD45þ/CD34þ cells. For hCD45þ/hCD34þ cells, mean involvement in the bone marrow of both mice was only 1.7% of
the mononuclear cell population. Moreover, analysis of the
hCD45þ/hCD34 population showed a morphology consistent with normal cells (Fig. 3E). To extend these observations,
cells from AML patient #20 with trisomy 14 were sorted into
CD34þ/lineage MUC1high and MUC1low cells and each of
these 2 populations were inoculated into 6 NSG mice. Here,

www.aacrjournals.org

the MUC1high cells failed to engraft, consistent with the lack
of engraftment encountered with certain AML samples
(9, 11, 23). However, 5 of 6 mice inoculated with MUC1low
cells engrafted with cytogenetically normal CD19þ lymphocytes (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
Engraftment of AML CD34 MUC1high and MUC1low cells
As noted above, blasts from patients with CD34 AML also
express MUC1. In this context, we analyzed MUC1high and
MUC1low populations from patient #25, who had CD34 AML
blasts that harbored a rearrangement of the MLL gene, making
it possible to distinguish the leukemic cell population by
detection of the abnormal karyotype. Flow cytometric sorting
was conducted to isolate the (i) CD34/lineage MUC1high and
(ii) CD34/lineage MUC1low cell populations (Fig. 4A). In
addition, approximately 0.1% of the MUC1low cells were identiﬁed as having a CD34þ/lineage phenotype (Fig. 4A). FISH
analysis showed that 99% of the CD34/lineage MUC1high
cells harbored the MLL gene rearrangement (Fig. 4B). Similar
results were obtained with the CD34/lineage MUC1low cells,
indicating that both MUC1high and MUC1low cells originate
from the leukemic clone (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the few CD34þ/
lineage MUC1low cells had a normal karyotype (Fig. 4B) and
thereby represented residual normal hematopoietic stem cells.
The isolated lineage MUC1high cells were inoculated into 6
NSG mice and after 90 days, the bone marrows were analyzed
for AML engraftment. Analysis of a bone marrow from a
representative mouse showed the presence of 36% human
CD45þ cells (Fig. 4C, left) that all expressed human CD11C
and not CD20 (Fig. 4C, right), consistent with a myeloid
phenotype. Morphology of the human CD45þ/CD11Cþ cells
was also consistent with AML cells (Fig. 4D, left). Moreover, the
engrafted hCD45þ/hCD11Cþ population had the MLL gene

rearrangement in concert with the leukemic genotype (Fig. 4D,
right). Notably, all of the 6 inoculated mice exhibited leukemic engraftment with a mean of 66% involvement of blasts in
the bone marrows. FISH analysis further showed that these
cells contained the MLL rearrangement, indicating the absence
of normal hematopoietic cells. In comparison, the lineage
MUC1low cells were inoculated into 6 mice. Analysis of the bone
marrows after 90 days showed that all of these 6 mice also had
engraftment of human CD45þ cells (Fig. 4E, left). However, in
contrast with the MUC1high cells, engraftment with MUC1low
cells consisted of predominantly human CD20þ and not
CD11Cþ cells, supporting a lymphoid population (Fig. 4E,
right). Indeed, morphology of the CD45þ/CD20þ cells was
consistent with normal lymphocytes (Fig. 4F, left) that lacked
the MLL gene rearrangement (Fig. 4F, right). Mean human
normal cell involvement of the bone marrows from the 6 mice
was 11%. These ﬁndings and those described above with
CD34þ/lineage cells support the contention that MUC1high
cells engraft with leukemia, whereas MUC1low cells predominantly engraft with normal hematopoietic cells.
Targeting MUC1 abrogates AML CD34þ cell engraftment

The demonstration that MUC1high cells confer the engraftment of leukemia in NSG mice invoked the possibility that

targeting MUC1 could be effective in preventing the establishment of disease. To address the effects of targeting MUC1, we
inoculated 10 mice with CD34þ/lineage MUC1high cells from
patient #1. After 24 hours, the mice were treated with PBS, the
vehicle control, or with GO-203, a cell-penetrating peptide
inhibitor of the oncogenic MUC1-C subunit. GO-203 consists
of a poly-Arg cell transduction domain linked to the CQCRRKN
sequence that binds to the MUC1-C cytoplasmic tail ([R]9CQCRRKN; all D-amino acids; ref. 24). Subcutaneous administration of GO-203 was continued for 21 days and then the
mice were followed for an additional 70 days. Analysis of the
bone marrow from a PBS-treated mouse showed the presence
of human CD45þ cells (Fig. 5A, left) that were also CD34þ (Fig.
5A, right). In contrast, analysis of the bone marrow from a GO203–treated mouse showed few, if any, detectable human
CD45þ/CD34þ cells (Fig. 5B, left and right). As compared with
the control mice, treatment with GO-203–abrogated leukemic
engraftment in 4 of the 5 GO-203–treated mice (Fig. 5C). The
bone marrow from the ﬁfth mouse treated with GO-203 had
1.9% involvement of the mononuclear population with human
CD45þ/CD34þ cells (Fig. 5C). Bone marrows of the GO-203–
treated mice had a mean of 0.5% involvement with leukemic
cells as compared with 27% for the 5 PBS-treated mice (Fig. 5C).
To assess the effects of treating established leukemia, we

#19. Over 90% of this CD34þ/lineage population expressed
high levels of MUC1, which was inoculated into 16 mice. At
60 days postinoculation, the mice were treated with PBS or
GO-203 for 21 days. Analysis of the bone marrow from a
PBS-treated mouse showed the presence of human CD45þ
cells (Fig. 5D, left) that had morphologic characteristics
consistent with leukemic blasts (Fig. 5D, right). In comparison, GO-203 treatment was associated with a signiﬁcant
decrease in human CD45þ leukemic cells (Fig. 5E and F),
indicating that targeting MUC1 decreases the engrafted
human leukemic cell population.
Targeting MUC1 is effective in the treatment of
established CD34 AML in NSG mice
To extend the above ﬁndings, blasts from patient #25 with
CD34 AML were sorted into lineage MUC1high and MUC1low
populations. The lineage MUC1high cells were inoculated into
NSG mice and after 2 months, treatment was initiated on the
basis of the detection of hCD45þ cells in the peripheral blood.
Treatment with PBS and GO-203 was continued for 21 days, at
which time the mice were sacriﬁced for analysis. The bone
marrow of a representative PBS-treated mouse had 74%

involvement with hCD45þ cells that also expressed hCD11C
and not hCD20 (Fig. 6A, left), and had leukemic cell morphology. Similar ﬁndings were obtained for involvement of leukemic cells in the spleen (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In a representative GO-203–treated mouse, there were few if any hCD45þ
cells in the bone marrow (Fig. 6A, right) and 0.4% involvement
of hCD20þ cells in the spleen (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Comparison of the bone marrows from the GO-203–treated
mice showed a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in hCD45þ cell
involvement compared with that obtained for the PBS-treated
mice (Fig. 6B). In contrast with the above results obtained with
MUC1high cells, studies of mice inoculated with MUC1low cells
showed engraftment of hCD45þ cells that expressed in part
CD20 in both the bone marrow (Fig. 6C, left) and spleen
(Supplementary Fig. S2C), and had a normal lymphoid morphology. Notably, treatment with GO-203 had no apparent
effect on the engraftment of normal hematopoietic cells in the
bone marrow (Fig. 6C, right) and spleen (Supplementary Fig.
S2D). These results were conﬁrmed with analysis of the bone
marrows of the GO-203–treated mice, which showed no signiﬁcant difference when compared with that obtained with

from that found in the bone marrows of the PBS-treated

Discussion
MUC1 is a heterodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed on
the apical borders of normal epithelial cells (16). With progression to carcinomas and loss of polarity, MUC1 is aberrantly
expressed at high levels over the entire cell surface and contributes to the malignant phenotype (16, 25). Somewhat surprisingly for this epithelial cell protein, expression of MUC1
was identiﬁed in blasts from patients with AML (14). In
addition, subsequent studies showed that MUC1 is detectable

5576

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

in certain CD34þ cells found in human cord blood and at
higher levels in AML CD34þ populations (15). In the present
work, AML CD34þ/lineage/CD38 cells from patients with
active disease were studied to determine whether this population, which has been associated with LSCs (5, 26), also
expresses MUC1. Our ﬁndings from the analysis of 20 patients
with AML showed the consistent expression of MUC1 in the
CD34þ/lineage/CD38 cell population. Speciﬁcally, the fraction of CD34þ/lineage/CD38 cells that expressed MUC1
ranged from 15% to 96% with a mean of 64%. AML CD34þ/
CD38 cells have characteristics of malignant stem cells in that
they have the capacity to generate AML, to give rise to
progenitor leukemic cells, and to self-renew (27, 28). However,
the CD34þ/CD38 population can include normal hematopoietic stem cells, invoking the possibility that MUC1 expression
as detected here could be also attributable to this population.
In that sense, we found that CD34þ/lineage/CD38 cells from
transplant donors express MUC1, but at low to undetectable
levels. Indeed, the fraction of MUC1þ normal CD34þ/lineage/
CD38 cells was less than 3%, indicating that MUC1 expression
is substantially higher in the leukemic CD34þ/lineage/CD38
population.

The CD34þ/CD38 cell phenotype has been associated
with leukemia-initiating cells that give rise to CD34þ/CD38þ
progenitors and more differentiated blasts (5). In certain
AML samples, the leukemic CD34þ/CD38þ progenitor population also contains leukemia-initiating cell capacity (29). In
this respect, we found that CD34þ/lineage/CD38þ-progenitor cell populations from patients with AML express MUC1
over a similar range of percentages as that obtained for the
CD34þ/lineage/CD38 cells. Leukemia-initiating activity
has also been identiﬁed in CD34 cell populations. For example, nucleophosmin (NPM) is a frequently mutated protein in

www.aacrjournals.org

AML and NPM-mutated leukemia is associated with attenuated expression of CD34 (30, 31). Moreover, NPM-mutated
AML samples have leukemia-initiating cells in the CD34
population (8). Accordingly, we studied 5 patients with
NPM-mutated CD34 AML and found MUC1 expression in
each of the CD34/lineage cell populations. Another patient
with AML cells harboring the MLL gene arrangement had
blasts that were CD34 and here MUC1 expression was also
detectable in the CD34/lineage population. On the basis
of these ﬁndings, we conclude that MUC1 is expressed in both
AML CD34þ and CD34 cells.

Given the phenotypic heterogeneity of AML stem cells, the
available evidence has supported their functional deﬁnition
based on the capacity for engraftment in immunodeﬁcient
mice. For this reason, we conducted studies to determine
whether leukemic CD34þ/lineage cells that express MUC1
engraft in NSG mice. Inoculation of MUC1high cells was
associated with the engraftment of leukemic cells. In comparison, MUC1low cells were ineffective in conferring AML
in vivo or this population engrafted with normal hematopoietic cells of lymphoid origin. In support of these results,
we studied engraftment of leukemic CD34/lineage cells
with the MLL gene rearrangement. Here, the MUC1high
population engrafted with leukemic cells that contained the
genetic alteration. Notably, however, the MUC1low population engrafted with normal hematopoietic cells, based on
absence of the MLL gene rearrangement and the detection of
cells with a lymphoid phenotype and morphology. These
ﬁndings indicate that the MUC1high, as compared with the
MUC1low, leukemic population is functional in initiating
leukemia in the NSG model. Engraftment of human leukemic
cells in immunocompromised mice is variable and may be
dependent on aggressiveness of disease (9, 11, 23). Given the
limited number of leukemic samples analyzed for leukemiainitiating activity and the selection of MUC1high cells, the
present studies have not determined whether levels of MUC1
expression in patient samples can predict success of engraftment. As found in the present work for MUC1, other studies
have showed that CD32 and CD25 are highly expressed in
leukemic CD34þ/CD38 stem cells that are functional in
engraftment in NSG mice (12). CD47 is also highly expressed
on AML stem cells and targeting CD47 blocks engraftment in
vivo (11). Thus, MUC1 represents another potential target on
the AML stem cell population and one that functions as an
oncoprotein, and contributes to the growth and survival of
malignant cells. In this context, targeting the oncogenic
MUC1-C subunit in AML cell lines and primary blasts with
GO-203 was found to be associated with loss of self-renewal
capacity (21).
Our ﬁndings that MUC1 is expressed in AML stem cell
populations that engraft in NSG mice prompted further studies
to determine whether targeting MUC1-C has therapeutic
potential in this model. MUC1-C promotes growth and blocks
death in the response to DNA damage, ROS, and other forms of
stress (32, 33). These MUC1-C functions are dependent on its
homodimerization (16, 25). Thus, agents, such as GO-203, that
block MUC1-C homodimer formation increase ROS levels in
AML cells and thereby induce death (21). In the present study,
GO-203 treatment blocked engraftment of AML CD34þ/lineage/MUC1high cells when administered at 24 hours after
inoculation. In addition to preventing engraftment, GO-203
was effective in treating leukemia that was established in NSG
mice inoculated with the AML CD34þ/lineage/MUC1high
population. In this way, GO-203 treatment was associated with
a marked decrease in AML cell involvement in the bone
marrow as compared with that in the control mice. These
ﬁndings were extended to studies of targeting MUC1-C in
leukemia established in NSG mice after inoculation of
CD34/lineage/MUC1high cells. Here, GO-203 treatment was

5578

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

also highly effective in decreasing leukemic cell involvement in
bone marrows and spleens. In addition, GO-203 had little if any
effect on normal hematopoiesis established by inoculation of
the CD34/lineage/MUC1low population, consistent with the
low to undetectable levels of MUC1 expression in normal
hematopoietic stem cells.
The precise mechanism by which MUC1-C inhibition
results in loss of engraftment potential by leukemia-initiating cells remains to be elucidated. Modulation of ROS has
been shown to be a critical factor for supporting the longterm repopulation capacity of leukemia stem cells (34).
Exposure of primary AML cells to GO-203 induces an upregulation of ROS, cell differentiation and death. In contrast,
concurrent blockade of ROS with NAC diminishes the lethal
effect of MUC1 inhibition on AML cells (21). The effect of
GO-203 on other downstream signaling pathways linked
with leukemia stem cell function such as b-catenin is
currently being explored.
In summary, our ﬁndings provide evidence that MUC1 is
highly expressed on AML stem cells as compared with their
normal counterparts and that MUC1 is a selective target for
the treatment of AML in the engrafted NSG mouse model.
GO-203 is under clinical evaluation in a phase I trial for
patients with refractory solid tumors. The experimental
results presented here provide the rationale for deﬁning the
effects of GO-203 in targeting the LSCs for the treatment of
patients with AML.
