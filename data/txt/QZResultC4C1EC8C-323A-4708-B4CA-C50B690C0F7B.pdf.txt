ABSTRACT
Gemcitabine is an important anticancer therapeutics approved for treatment of
several human cancers including locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Its clinical effectiveness, however, is hindered by existence
of intrinsic and development of acquired resistances. Previously, it was found that
14-3-3σ expression associates with poor clinical outcome of PDAC patients. It was
also found that 14-3-3σ expression is up-regulated in gemcitabine resistant PDAC
cells and contributes to the acquired gemcitabine resistance. In this study, we
investigated the molecular mechanism of 14-3-3σ function in gemcitabine resistance
and found that 14-3-3σ up-regulates YAP1 expression and then binds to YAP1 to
inhibit gemcitabine-induced caspase 8 activation and apoptosis. 14-3-3σ association
with YAP1 up-regulates the expression of ribonucleotide reductase M1 and M2, which
may mediate 14-3-3σ/YAP1 function in the acquired gemcitabine resistance. These
findings suggest a possible role of YAP1 signaling in gemcitabine resistance.

that 14-3-3σ expression is upregulated via epigenetic
regulation and contributes to the acquired gemcitabine
resistance in the gemcitabine-selected PDAC G3K cells
[8]. In addition to the acquired gemcitabine resistance
in PDAC cells, 14-3-3σ has been implicated in acquired
doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells [9] and in
cisplatin resistance of colon cancer cells [10]. Although
14-3-3σ is known to belong to the highly conserved 143-3 protein family that binds to many phosphoserine/
phosphothreonine proteins important in multiple
biological processes such as signal transduction, cell
cycle control, and survival [11-14], how its increased
expression contributes to acquired drug resistance in
general and gemcitabine resistance more specifically is
largely unknown.
One of the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine
protein partners of 14-3-3 family proteins is YAP1, a
transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo/YAP pathway,
which binds to and activates several transcription factors
including Runx [15] and the highly conserved TEAD/
TEF transcription factors [16]. Once phosphorylated at
a key serine residue (Ser127), YAP is sequestered in the
cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 proteins, where it can no

INTRODUCTION
Gemcitabine is a deoxycytidine analogue approved
as the first-line chemotherapeutic drug for patients
with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) [1, 2], one of the cancers having
poorest prognosis with 5-year survival rate hovering only
around 7% [3]. One of the major causes for the poor
prognosis of PDAC is that it is intrinsically resistant or can
acquire resistance to treatments including gemcitabine.
Several molecular mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance
have been identified including dysregulation of enzymes
participating in gemcitabine metabolism, down-regulation
of gemcitabine importer hENT1, down-regulation of ratelimiting enzyme dCK, and up-regulation of gemcitabine
target, ribonucleotide reductase M1 and M2 (RRM1 and
RRM2) [4]. RRM has also been suggested to mediate
C-MYC-dependent suppression of senescence [5].
It has also been shown previously that increased 143-3σ expression associates with poor prognosis of PDAC
[6, 7]. Recently, using a newly established gemcitabine
resistant PDAC cell line, G3K derived from MiaPaCa-2
cells via stepwise gemcitabine selections, we showed

longer function to promote target gene expression [17].
The crystal structure of 14-3-3σ/YAP1 phosphopeptide
complex has been resolved at 1.15Å resolution, suggesting
the interaction between YAP1 and 14-3-3σ [18]. In this
study, we show that 14-3-3σ not only interacts with
YAP1 but also regulates YAP1 expression. The increased
14-3-3σ and YAP1 expression cooperates to contribute
to the acquired gemcitabine resistance by inhibiting
gemcitabine-induced caspase 8 activation possibly via
up-regulating the expression of gemcitabine target protein
RRM1 and RRM2.

resistance if it works together with 14-3-3σ. To test this
possibility, we took advantage of MiaPaCa-2 cells with
stable over-expression of Flag-14-3-3σ (MiaPaCa-2/σ
cells) and over-expressed GFP-YAP1 followed by survival
assay in the presence of gemcitabine. As shown in Figure
2C, over-expression of GFP-YAP1 significantly increased
gemcitabine resistance of the MiaPaCa-2/σ cells. Thus,
it is possible that YAP1 up-regulation contributes to the
acquired gemcitabine resistance in G3K cells but it may
require the presence of 14-3-3σ for this function.

14-3-3σ and YAP1 are inter-dependent in
gemcitabine resistance

RESULTS

To further investigate if YAP1 requires 14-3-3σ in
gemcitabine resistance, we transiently over-expressed
GFP-YAP1 in MiaPaCa-2/σ cells followed by knocking
down 14-3-3σ and survival assay. As shown in Figure
3A, GFP-YAP1 over-expression significantly increased
gemcitabine resistance of MiaPaCa-2/σ cells as expected.
However, knocking down 14-3-3σ in MiaPaCa-2/σ cells
with GFP-YAP1 over-expression completely eliminated
the GFP-YAP1 over-expression-induced increase
in gemcitabine resistance. It is noteworthy that the
gemcitabine resistance of the 14-3-3σ knockdown cells
is significantly lower than the control MiaPaCa-2/σ cells,
demonstrating that the basal resistance induced by 14-33σ over-expression in MiaPaCa-2/σ cells is reduced by
14-3-3σ knockdown. This observation is consistent with
our previous findings demonstrating the role of 14-3-3σ in
gemcitabine resistance [8]. Similarly, YAP1 knockdown
in MiaPaCa-2/σ cells also eliminated 14-3-3σ-induced
gemcitabine resistance (Figure 3B). These findings suggest
that YAP1 and 14-3-3σ may depend on each other for their
functions in gemcitabine resistance.
To better address this hypothesis, we performed
double knockdown experiments in G3K cells. As shown
in Figure 4A, YAP1 and 14-3-3σ could be simultaneously
knocked down. While knocking down 14-3-3σ or YAP1
individually significantly reduced gemcitabine resistance
of G3K cells, which is consistent with above findings, the
double knockdown of 14-3-3σ and YAP1 did not result
in further reduction in gemcitabine resistance. It is also
noteworthy that the double knockdown did not affect the
proliferation of G3K cells (data not shown). To ensure the
above observation on gemcitabine resistance is not due to
the use of a specific gemcitabine-selected cell line G3K, we
performed a similar experiment using another PDAC cell
line, ASPC-1, that expresses endogenous 14-3-3σ. As shown
in Figure 4B, individual knockdowns of 14-3-3σ or YAP1
resulted in significant reduction in gemcitabine resistance
in ASPC-1 cells. Similar to G3K cells, double knockdown
did not result in further reduction in gemcitabine resistance
in ASPC-1 cells. Hence, 14-3-3σ and YAP1 may cooperate
and require each other in pancreatic cancer cell survival
against gemcitabine treatment.

YAP1 over-expression in G3K cells and its
regulation by 14-3-3σ
To determine the potential role of YAP1 in
14-3-3σ-mediated gemcitabine resistance, we first tested
the level of total YAP1 and pYAP1 (Ser127 phosphorylated)
in the parental MiaPaCa-2 and its gemcitabine resistant
derivative G3K cells. As shown in Figure 1A, both
YAP1 and pYAP1 proteins as well as YAP1 mRNA were
significantly increased in G3K compared with MiaPaCa-2
cells. Because 14-3-3σ expression is also up-regulated in
G3K cells (Figure 1A), we next investigated if 14-3-3σ and
YAP1 expression is related by first knocking down 14-33σ in G3K cells and testing its effect on YAP1 expression.
Figure 1B shows that 14-3-3σ knockdown significantly
reduced YAP1 mRNA and protein levels. Ectopically
over-expressing 14-3-3σ in the parental MiaPaCa-2 cells
increased YAP1 mRNA and protein levels (Figure 1C).
However, knocking down YAP1 had no effect on 14-3-3σ
expression (Figure 1D). These findings suggest that 14-33σ may regulate YAP1 expression but not vice versa.

Role of YAP1 in gemcitabine resistance
To determine if the increased YAP1 expression
in G3K cells potentially contributes to the acquired
gemcitabine resistance, we first knocked down YAP1
in G3K cells followed by examining the difference in
gemcitabine resistance using MTT assay. As shown in
Figure 2A, YAP1 knockdown was successfully achieved
without affecting 14-3-3σ expression and it dramatically
reduced gemcitabine resistance of G3K cells. Unlike 14-33σ over-expression in the parental MiaPaCa-2 cells, which
resulted in increased gemcitabine resistance [8], ectopic
over-expression of GFP-YAP1 in MiaPaCa-2 cells did not
significantly influence the gemcitabine response (Figure
2B). This observation is intriguing and inconsistent with
our findings of YAP1 knockdown in G3K cells (Figure 2A).
Because YAP1 does not affect 14-3-3σ expression
and the parental MiaPaCa-2 cells express little or no
14-3-3σ, YAP1 over-expression alone in the parental
MiaPaCa-2 cells may not be able to induce gemcitabine

14-3-3σ and YAP1 co-localize and interact with
each other

they protect PDAC cells against gemcitabine-induced
apoptosis. As shown in Figure 6A, 14-3-3σ knockdown
in G3K cells led to dose-dependent increase in
gemcitabine-induced PARP-1 cleavage, an indicator
of apoptosis. To confirm this finding and to ensure the
effect was not due to off-target effect of the siRNA used,
we performed apoptosis assay using the Cell Death
Detection ELISA kit that quantifies the level of DNA
fragmentation in a stable 14-3-3σ knockdown clone of
G3K cells [8]. Figure 6B shows that the stable 14-33σ knockdown using shRNA with a different targeting
sequence from the siRNA used in the above experiments
also significantly increased gemcitabine-induced
apoptosis of G3K cells. Meanwhile, 14-3-3σ overexpression in the parental MiaPaCa-2 cells eliminated
gemcitabine-induced PARP1 cleavage (Figure 6C–6D).
Similar to 14-3-3σ knockdown, YAP1 knockdown
in G3K cells also led to dose-dependent increase in
gemcitabine-induced PARP1 cleavage (Figure 6E).
Thus, both YAP1 and 14-3-3σ helps protect PDAC cells
against gemcitabine-induced apoptosis.

To further test the cooperativity between 14-3-3σ
and YAP1, we tested if they co-localize and possibly
interact with each other. As shown in Figure 5A, both
YAP1 and 14-3-3σ co-localized in the cytoplasm of
G3K cells. We next performed co-immunoprecipitation
analysis of 14-3-3σ and GFP-YAP1. As shown in
Figure 5B, immunoprecipitation of 14-3-3σ resulted
in co-precipitation of the phosphorylated YAP1.
Immunoprecipitation of YAP1 also resulted in coprecipitation of the ectopically over-expressed Flag-14-33σ in G3K cells. Thus, 14-3-3σ likely can bind to and form
a complex with pYAP1.

have shown previously that the gemcitabine-resistant G3K
cells also over-express RRM1 and RRM2 [8] (see also
Figure 7A). To determine if there is a potential relationship
between RRM1/RRM2 and 14-3-3σ/YAP1, we first tested
RRM1 and RRM2 expression in MiaPaCa-2 cells with
stable 14-3-3σ over-expression. As shown in Figure 7A,
both RRM1 and RRM2 are up-regulated by 14-3-3σ overexpression and down-regulated by 14-3-3σ knockdown
using siRNA. Similarly, stable 14-3-3σ knockdown in G3K
cells using shRNA also reduced expression of RRM1 and
RRM2 (data not shown). Furthermore, 14-3-3σ knockdown
also reduced the expression of both RRM1 and RRM2
in G500 and G1K cells with intermediate gemcitabine
resistance, which were produced during selection of G3K
cells [8], suggesting that 14-3-3σ regulation of RRM1 and
RRM2 expression is not specific to G3K cells. Similar to
14-3-3σ knockdown, YAP1 knockdown also reduced the
expression of both RRM1 and RRM2 in G3K cells (Figure
7C). Thus, RRM1 and RRM2 may be the downstream
mediators of 14-3-3σ/YAP1-induced gemcitabine resistance.
More importantly, consistent with the prior findings that
double knockdown of 14-3-3σ and YAP1 simultaneously
did not further reduce gemcitabine resistance (Figure 4),
simultaneous knockdown of 14-3-3σ and YAP1 fails to
further reduce the expression of both RRM1 and RRM2
compared with single knockdowns (Figure 7D). Thus,
RRM1 and RRM2 may be the key downstream mediators
of 14-3-3σ/YAP1-induced gemcitabine resistance.

To investigate the specific apoptotic pathway
that 14-3-3σ and YAP1 interferes, we first analyzed
caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation following
gemcitabine treatment in G3K cells. As shown in
Figure 6, gemcitabine-induced caspase-8 cleavage and
activation was dramatically elevated in YAP1 (Figure
6E) and 14-3-3σ (Figure 6F) knockdown G3K cells and
dramatically reduced in the 14-3-3σ-over-expressing
MiaPaCa-2 cells (Figure 6C) compared with their
respective control cells. However, caspase-9 activation
was not affected (data not shown). It is noteworthy
that G3K cells with stable 14-3-3σ knockdown using
shRNA (Figure 6F) with different targeting sequence
from siRNA (Figure 6A) also caused similar increase in
gemcitabine-induced PARP1 cleavage, consistent with
the findings shown in Figure 6B. Thus, likely 14-3-3σ
and YAP1 may protect against gemcitabine-induced
apoptosis by attenuating gemcitabine-induced caspase-8
activation.

Role of 14-3-3σ and YAP1 in regulating RRM1
and RRM2 expression
To understand how 14-3-3σ and YAP1 interfere with
gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in PDAC cells, we resorted
to the previously well known mechanisms of gemcitabine
resistance, namely the over-expression of ribonucleotide
reductase M1 and M2 (RRM1 and RRM2) [19, 20]. We

DISCUSSION

YAP1 expression has not yet been studied, analysis of
human YAP1 promoter sequence shows potential binding
site for p53, AP-1, and c-Jun (unpublished observations).
Because MiaPaCa-2 cells carry an inactive mutant
p53, 14-3-3σ unlikely regulates YAP1 transcription
via p53 although 14-3-3σ has been shown to positively
regulate p53 [25]. Whether other transcription factors
such as AP-1 and c-Jun mediates 14-3-3σ regulation of
YAP1 transcription remain to be determined. We also
found that pYAP1 was dramatically altered by 14-3-3σ.
While the increased pYAP1 may be due to the increased
total YAP1 expression, it is also possible that 14-3-3σ
binding to pYAP1 stabilizes pYAP1, which contributes
to the increased level of total YAP1 although this may be
unlikely since 14-3-3σ knockdown did not reduce ectopic
GFP-YAP1 (Figure 3A).
14-3-3σ and YAP1 over-expression-induced
gemcitabine resistance appears to be via protecting cells
against gemcitabine-induced caspase-8 activation and
apoptosis. This observation is consistent with a previous
report that gemcitabine induces caspase-8 activation
in H292 cells and enhances cell sensitivity to Fasmediated cytotoxic activity [26]. Although it remains
to be determined how gemcitabine induces caspase-8
activation, it has also been reported that gemcitabine
induces apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
cells by increasing expression of functionally active Fas
(CD95, APO-1) and up-regulating Fas ligand (FasL)
[26, 27]. However, it remains to be determined if 14-

While 14-3-3σ expression has been found to
increase in cancer cells that have acquired drug resistant
phenotype and contribute to the resistance, the detailed
molecular mechanisms of its function in drug resistance
remain elusive. Previously, it has been suggested that
increased 14-3-3σ expression may cause resistance to
drug-induced apoptosis [9], possibly by binding to and
arresting cyclin B1 and CDC2 [21, 22] and pro-apoptotic
proteins such as Bax and Bad [23, 24] in cytoplasm.
Somatic knockout of 14-3-3σ in colon cancer cells has
been shown to cause drug-induced mitotic catastrophe
by reducing cellular ability to arrest in G2/M phase in
response to DNA damage [21]. In this study, we identified
a novel mechanism of 14-3-3σ-induced gemcitabine
resistance in PDAC. As shown in Figure 7E, 14-3-3σ
over-expression may promote YAP1 expression and
interact with YAP1. The inter-dependent 14-3-3σ/YAP1
interaction contributes to acquired gemcitabine resistance
by attenuating gemcitabine-induced caspase-8 activation
and apoptosis, possibly via enhancing the expression of
RRM1 and RRM2, which are well known mechanisms in
gemcitabine resistance.
In this study, we found that 14-3-3σ not only
interacts and binds to YAP1, it also regulates YAP1
expression. Because YAP1 mRNA level was also
changed by 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3σ may regulate YAP1
transcription. Although transcriptional regulation of

3-3σ/YAP1 up-regulation contributes to inhibition of
gemcitabine-induced caspase-8 activation by affecting
Fas or FasL.
One of the major targets of gemcitabine is RRM1
and RRM2, which ensure sufficient supply of dNTP
pool for DNA synthesis of proliferating cancer cells.
Increased expression of RRM1 and RRM2 has been
shown to contribute to acquired gemcitabine resistance
[19, 20]. The finding that 14-3-3σ/YAP1 increases
RRM1 and RRM2 expression is very intriguing while
this finding suggests that RRM1 and RRM2 may be
possible downstream mediators of 14-3-3σ/YAP1induced gemcitabine resistance. However, it remains
to be determined how 14-3-3σ/YAP1 up-regulates
RRM1 and RRM2 expression. Because both 14-3-3σ
and YAP1 exert their functions by binding to other
proteins, it is tempting to speculate that the increased
14-3-3σ/YAP1 complex may increase RRM1 and RRM2
stability. Because YAP1 binds to other transcription
factors and regulate gene transcription, 14-3-3σ/YAP1
complex may also regulate the transcription of RRM1
and RRM2. One such potential transcription factor
is NF-κB, which has been shown to regulate RRM2
expression in gemcitabine-resistant human oral cancer
KB cell line [28]. It has also been found that depleting
glucose in culture media reduces RRM1 expression in
PDAC cells [29]. However, it remains to be determined
if 14-3-3σ/YAP1 participates in this regulation of
RRM1 expression. Furthermore, CBL0137, a curaxin
that inhibits chromatin remodeling complex FACT,
sensitizes gemcitabine resistance in PDAC cells
possibly by reducing RRM1 and RRM2 expression
[30]. Interestingly, we previously observed that 143-3σ up-regulation in the gemcitabine resistant G3K
cells was due to reduced gene methylation. It is, thus,
of interest to determine if CBL0137 affects 14-3-3σ
expression by inhibiting chromatin remodeling, which
in turn down-regulates RRM expression and increases
gemcitabine sensitivity.
In summary, 14-3-3σ may have multiple
mechanisms of function in contributing to drug
resistance. This multifaceted property may be derived
from its activity being able to interact with multiple
proteins. However, it remains to be determined if 143-3σ plays an important role in clinically acquired or
intrinsic gemcitabine resistance in PDAC or clinical
drug resistance in general although increased 14-3-3σ
expression has been found in PDAC samples and appears
to associate with poor prognosis of PDAC [6, 7]. It also
remains to be determined if 14-3-3σ can be established
as a potential target for drug discovery to sensitize drugresistant human cancers in combinational chemotherapy.
We are currently working toward addressing these
questions.

Cell lines, cultures, and transfections
The gemcitabine resistant human PDAC cell lines
G500, G1K and G3K cells were generated by stepwise
selection of MiaPaCa-2 cells using increasing concentrations
of gemcitabine and cultured in DMEM medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2.5% horse
serum in the presence of gemcitabine as previously described
[8]. Human PDAC cell line ASPC-1 was from ATCC and
cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal

Cultured cells were harvested, washed with PBS,
and lysed in TNN-SDS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% SDS,
and 2 mM phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 minutes
at 4°C with constant agitation. The cell lysates were then
sonicated briefly and followed by centrifugation (14,000×g
at 4°C) for 15 minutes to remove insoluble materials. The
protein concentrations of supernatants were measured by
Bradford assay.
Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to a PVDF membrane followed by a 2-hr
incubation in blocking solution (PBS-buffered saline
containing 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20)
and a 2-hr incubation with primary antibodies. After
extensive washes, immunoreactivity was detected with
specific secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase. Signals were captured using ECL x-ray
film.

Immunofluorescence and confocal
microscope imaging
1-2 × 105 G3K cells were seeded on a glass
coverslip in a six-well tissue culture plate. After the
culture reaches confluence, the cells were washed 3
times with ice-cold PBS and fixed with acetone/methanol
(1:1) at room temperature for 15 min and incubated with
blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for
1 h. The cells were then probed with primary antibody
YAP1 (1:200) for 2 hrs followed by incubation with
FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2fragment
(Sigma) (1:1000 dilution) for 30 min. After being washed
3 times with blocking solution, the cells were re-probed
with another primary antibody 14-3-3σ (1:50) for 2 hrs
followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 647 dye (Life
Technologies) for additional 30 min. Then, after being
washed 3 times, the cell nucleus was counterstained with
DAPI (25 μg/ml) for 20 min. The coverslips were then
mounted on the slides before viewing with Olympus 2
confocal microscope. The laser excitation lines are as
follows: 405 nM for DAPI, 488 nM for FITC, and 635
nM for Alexa Fluor 647. The image was then virtualized
by Olympus Fluoview Ver.3.0 viewer (FV10-ASW 3.0
viewer).

Survival and apoptosis assay
Survival assay was performed as previously
described using MTT colorimetric assay [7, 33]. Briefly,
cells were seeded in 96-well plate at 2000-3000 cells/
well and cultured for 24 hrs followed by treatment
with different doses of anticancer drugs and incubated
continuously for 3 days followed by addition of MTT
(5 mg/ml) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and
incubation of the plates at 37°C for 4 hours. The OD570nm
and OD630nm were measured using an automated plate
reader and analyzed using GraphPad Prism software
to generate fitted curve and IC50. Relative resistance
factor (RRF) is calculated using the following formula:
RRF=IC50(test)/IC50(control). For apoptosis assay, photometric
enzyme immunoassay using a Cell Death Detection
ELISA Plus kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN)
was performed for quantitative in vitro determination
of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments and
apoptosis as previously described [34].

Immunoprecipitation assay
Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously
described [37]. Briefly, 1 mg of cell lysates were first
pre-cleaned by incubation with 1 μg of normal mouse
IgG at 4 °C for 1 h, then mixed with 150 μL of protein
G agarose beads (50% slurry) and incubated at 4 °C for
2 hrs followed by centrifugation at 500× g for 5 min.
The cleared supernatants were split into two equal parts
incubated with either normal mouse IgG (as a negative
control) or incubated with primary antibodies (anti-Flag,
anti-YAP1, anti-pYAP1, or anti-GFP) at 4°C for 3 h, then
each part was mixed with 50 μL of protein G agarose
beads. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the reaction
was centrifuged to collect precipitates which were then
washed five times with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100)
before being subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis for Western
blot analysis.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as
described previously [35, 36]. Briefly, total RNA
was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit followed
by reverse-transcription using iScriptTM cDNA
synthesis kit and quantitative PCR using the SYBR
Green PCR master mix. The primer pairs used are:
5′-TAGGCGCTGTTCTTGCTCCAA-3′ (forward) and
5′-ACCAGTGGTTAGGTGCGCTCA-3′ (reverse) for 143-3σ; 5′-AAGAGCAGCGTGCCAGAGAT-3′ (forward)
and 5′-ACACATCAAAGACCAGTCCTGATTAG-3′
(reverse) for RRM1; 5′-TCTGGCTTTCTTTGCAG
