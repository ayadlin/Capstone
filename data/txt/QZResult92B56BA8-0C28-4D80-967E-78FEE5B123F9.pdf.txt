Abstract
CBP-93872 was previously identiﬁed as a G2 checkpoint inhibitor using a cell-based high-throughput
screening system. However, its molecular actions as well as cellular targets are largely unknown. Here, we
uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying abrogation of the G2 checkpoint by CBP-93872. CBP-93872
speciﬁcally abrogates the DNA double-stranded break (DSB)–induced G2 checkpoint through inhibiting
maintenance but not initiation of G2 arrest because of speciﬁc inhibition of DSB-dependent ATR activation.
Hence, ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Nbs1 and replication protein A 2 upon DSB was strongly
suppressed in the presence of CBP-93872. CBP-93872 did not seem to inhibit DNA-end resection, but did
inhibit Nbs1-dependent and ssDNA-induced ATR activation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Taken
together, our results suggest that CBP-93872 is an inhibitor of maintenance of the DSB-speciﬁc G2 checkpoint
and thus might be a strong candidate as the basis for a drug that speciﬁcally sensitizes p53-mutated cancer
cells to DSB-inducing DNA damage therapy. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3880–9. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Maintaining the genomic stability of both normal cells and
cancer cells depends on coordinated networks of different
forms of the DNA damage response, which execute various cell
activities such as cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and premature
senescence (1). Abrogation of these systems likely leads to
extensive genomic instability and subsequent cell death upon
DNA damage. Cell-cycle arrest in response to DNA damage
plays a key role in increasing cell survival and is mediated in
mammals by at least two distinct pathways; one via ATM-p53p21 (2, 3) and the other via ATM/ATR-Chk1-Cdc25 (4, 5). The
former mediates both G1 and G2 arrest and the latter mediates
G2 arrest (6–8). Given that most cancer cells have genetic
alterations in p53, their survival in the presence of DNA
damage depends on a functional Chk1-mediated G2 checkpoint, suggesting that reagents capable of inhibiting this
checkpoint would be promising drugs for producing synthetic
lethality to p53-deﬁcient cancer cells.

Signals initiated by DNA damage sensors are rapidly transduced to downstream targets in a manner dependent on the
type of damage. For example, signals from DNA double-stranded break (DSB) sensors are rapidly transduced to an ataxia
telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase (9) and a DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) that in turn
leads to the processing of DSBs by nucleases generating an
ATR-activating structure (10–12). In contrast, a broad spectrum of DNA damage changes, such as a structure consisting of
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a junction between ssDNA
and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), can directly activate ATMand Rad3-related (ATR) kinases in a replication protein A
(RPA)- and Rad17-dependent manner, respectively (13). The
activated ATM and/or ATR transduce the damage signals to a
large number of downstream effectors, such as p53, Chk1, and
Chk2, and execute G1 and G2 DNA damage checkpoints (1).
On the basis of the absolute requirement for the G2 DNA
damage checkpoint for p53-deﬁcient cancer cell survival upon
DNA damage, various G2 checkpoint inhibitors have been
developed and proposed for clinical application. Among them,
caffeine is one of the most extensively investigated agents that
inhibits ATM and ATR kinases and increases sensitization of
p53-deﬁcient cells to IR irradiation. Chk1 inhibitors, such as
UCN-01 (14), CEP-3891 (15), and AZD7762 (16) are also
proposed to be potent G2 checkpoint suppressors. However,
the kinases ATR and Chk1 are essential for mammalian cell
survival (17–21) and ATM is also required for maintaining
genomic integrity during normal cell growth (22). Therefore,
these drugs would have unexpected deleterious effects on
normal cell function, diminishing the possibility of their
clinical application.

CBP-93872 Is an Inhibitor of DSB-Speciﬁc Activation of ATR

We have previously identiﬁed CBP-93872 as a promising
G2 checkpoint inhibitor using a high-throughput screening
system that detected abrogation of the G2 checkpoint in IRirradiated HT-29 cells (23). However, molecular mechanisms
underlying G2 checkpoint inhibition by this drug are largely
unknown. Importantly, treatment with this drug markedly
sensitized p53-mutated cancer cells to DSB-inducing DNA
damaging agents. In this study, we investigated the molecular
basis of G2 checkpoint inhibition by CBP-93872 in p53-deﬁcient
cancer cells and found that CBP-93872 speciﬁcally inhibited
DSB-mediated and Nbs1-dependent activation of ATR.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and drug treatment
HT29 and HCT116 cells were grown in McCoy's 5A (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovin serum (FBS) and 1%
penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen). NCI-H460, A549 and
MCF7 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. All
cells were cultured at 37  C under 5% CO2.
Inhibitors used in this study were as follows: CBP-93872 (20
mmol/L; kindly supplied by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.),
UCN01 (300 nmol/L; Sigma-Aldrich), caffeine (2 mmol/L;
Sigma-Aldrich), KU-55933 (20 mmol/L; Sigma-Aldrich), and
Nocodazole (500 nmol/L; Sigma-Aldrich).
MMS (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 200 mmol/L and hydroxyurea (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at different concentrations.
Plasmid construction
To generate lentivirus shRNA constructs, an shRNA-coding
fragment with a 50 -ACGTGTGCTGTCCGT-30 loop was
digested into pENTER4-H1tetOx1 (a gift of H. Miyoshi). To
insert the H1tetOx1-shRNA into a lentivirus vector, the vector
pENTER4-H1tetOx1-shRNA was mixed with CS-RFA-ETBsd
(a gift of H. Miyoshi) and treated with Gateway LR clonase
(Invitrogen).
The full-length cDNA of wild-type human Nbs1 was obtained
by RT-PCR, and ligated into pcDNA3.1-myc-His vector. To
construct Tet-on inducible lentivirus vectors, a cDNA fragment
of Nbs1 containing the myc-His epitope was inserted into a
pENTER1A vector (Invitrogen). shRNA-resistant mutations
and an EDE mutation of pENTR1A Nbs1-myc-His were generated by inverse PCR with a Site-Speciﬁc Mutagenesis Kit
(Toyobo). The resultant plasmids were mixed with CS-IV-TRERfA-UbC-Puro vector (a gift of H. Miyoshi), and treated with
Gateway LR clonase to generate the lentivirus vectors.
Virus generation and infection
Lentiviruses expressing the respective shRNAs were generated by cotransfection of 293T cells with pCMV-VSV-G-RSVRevB (a gift of H. Miyoshi), pCAG-HIVgp (a gift of H. Miyoshi),
and the respective CS-RFA-ETBsd using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. HT29 cells infected with the
viruses were treated with 10 mg/mL blasticidin (Invitrogen) for
3 days.
For the generation of cells depleted of endogenous Nbs1 and
expressing ectopic Nbs1Wt-myc-His or Nbs1EDE-myc-His,
HT29 cells expressing shNbs1 were infected with lentiviruses

www.aacrjournals.org

expressing pENTR1A Nbs1Wt-myc-His or pENTR1A Nbs1EDEmyc-His containing an shRNA-resistant mutation. Infected
cells were treated with 10 mg/mL blasticidin and 2 mg/mL of
puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich).
To express the inducible shRNA and gene, doxycycline
(Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated in the medium at a concentration of 1 mg/mL for 3 days.
shRNA target sequences
The targeting sequences used in preparing shRNA were as
follows: ATR, GCCGCTAATCTTCTAACATTA; CtIP, GCATCATCCTTCAGCCCTTGA; Nbs1, GGAGGAAGATGTCAATGTTAG; and control, CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA.
Measurement of mitotic indices
Cells were treated with IR, UV, or MMS, and ﬁxed with 70%
ethanol at speciﬁc times. Nocodazole was added 1 hour after
treatment. Fixed cells were then stained with antibodies to
phospho-histone H3 at S10 (H3 pS10; 1:200; Millipore) for 1
hour, followed by 30-minute incubation with Alexa Fluor 488
secondary antibodies (1:100; Invitrogen). DNA was counterstained with 0.1 mg/mL propidium iodide containing RNase
for 30 minutes at 37  C. Flow cytometry was performed using a
FACSCanto II ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Antibodies
Antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary
Table S1.
Immunoblotting
For preparation of whole cell extracts, cells were lysed
with immunoprecipitation kinase buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES,
pH 8.0, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L EDTA
1 mmol/L DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol) containing a
cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates
were boiled with SDS sample buffer (45 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH
6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 50 mmol/L
DTT). Proteins in the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes.
Membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies, followed by 1 hour incubation with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies.
Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as previously described (24). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed
in immunoprecipitated kinase buffer containing a cocktail of
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were incubated with primary antibodies at 4  C for overnight, followed by
incubation with protein G-agarose (GE Healthcare) for 1 hour.
Immunoprecipitates were thoroughly washed three times with
immunoprecipitation kinase buffer and resuspended in 2
SDS sample buffer.
Immunohistochemical analysis
Cells on cover slips were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10
minutes at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes, and incubated in blocking buffer

(PBS þ 5% bovine serum albumin þ 0.1% Tween 20) for 30
minutes. The cells on the slips were then incubated with antiRPA2 and anti-g-H2AX antibodies diluted in blocking buffer
(1:500) for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by incubation with anti-rat IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Life
Technologies) and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor
594 (Life Technologies) secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (1:400) for 1 hour at room temperature. Nuclei were
counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (1:1,000).
In vitro kinase assay
ATR kinase assays were performed essentially as previously
described (25) with the following modiﬁcations. HEK293E cells
were transfected with Flag-ATR– and His-ATRIP–expressing
plasmids, and Flag-ATR was immunoprecipitated with antiFlag M2 antibody in TGN buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L phosphoglycerol, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 20, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride
(PMSF), 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L DTT, and
protease inhibitors]. The precipitates were washed twice with
the TGN buffer, once with the TGN buffer supplemented with
0.5 M LiCl, and twice with the reaction buffer [10 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 50 mmol/L
glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L DTT, and protease inhibitors]
without ATP. The in vitro kinase reactions were conducted in
the presence of 50 mmol/L ATP and puriﬁed GST-Rad17. Phosphorylation of Rad17 was monitored using phospho-Rad17
(Ser645) antibody (Bethyl).
Preparation of nuclear extracts
HCT116 cells were grown to 80% conﬂuence, trypsinized,
and centrifuged (200  g for 3 minutes at room temperature),
then washed in PBS. The cell pellets were suspended in a 5
packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer A (10 mmol/L HepesKOH, pH 7.9, 10 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/L
DTT, and 0.5 mmol/L PMSF) supplemented with a cocktail of
protease inhibitors (Nakalai Tesque) and incubated on ice for
5 minutes. Cells were then centrifuged at 500  g for 5
minutes at 4 C, suspended in a 2 packed cell volume of
buffer A and lysed by Dounce homogenization using a tightﬁtting pestle. Nuclei were collected as a pellet by centrifugation at 4,000  g for 5 minutes at 4 C and extracted in an
equal volume of buffer C (20 mmol/L Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 600
mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 25%
glycerol, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, and 0.5 mmol/L PMSF) supplemented with a protease cocktail, and mixed on a rotator at
4 C for 30 minutes. Nuclear extracts (supernatants) were
recovered by centrifugation (16,000  g for 15 minutes at
4 C) and dialyzed using Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassettes
(3,500-D protein molecular weight cutoff; Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) against buffer D (20 mmol/L Hepes-KOH, pH
7.9, 100 mmol/L KCl, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5
mmol/L DTT, and 0.5 mmol/L PMSF). Dialyzed nuclear
extracts were centrifuged (16,000  g for 30 minutes at 4 C)
to eliminate residual precipitates. The protein concentration
of the clear supernatant was determined using Bradford's
estimation method, and aliquots were snap frozen and stored
at 80 C.

Extract-based ATR activation assay
An extract-based ATR activation assay was performed
essentially as previously described (26) with the following
modiﬁcations. Nuclear extracts were pretreated with 10
mmol/L of KU-55933 and NU7026 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15
minutes on ice to inhibit ATM and DNA-PKcs, and supplemented with the reaction buffer (buffer R), which brought the
ﬁnal buffer compositions to 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.6), 50
mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L phenylmethanesulfonylﬂuoride, 0.5 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/L ATP, 10

Results
CBP-93872 speciﬁcally suppresses the DSB-induced G2
checkpoint
To clarify the molecular basis of G2 checkpoint abrogation
by CBP-93872 (Fig. 1A), we ﬁrst examined whether the effect of
this drug on the G2 checkpoint was dependent on the type of
DNA damage. HT-29 cells lacking functional p53 were treated
with IR, UV, or MMS in the presence or absence of CBP-93872,
and the cell cycle before entry into mitosis arrest was evaluated
by determining mitotic indices using phospho-histone H3 at
serine 10 (H3 pS10) as a mitotic marker. CBP-93872 effectively
suppressed G2 arrest induced by IR treatment whereas it did
not affect that induced by UV or MMS (Fig. 1B). In contrast,
UCN-01 effectively suppressed G2 arrest induced by UV and
MMS. Consistent with this, upon IR treatment, Chk1 phosphorylation at serines 317 and 345 was notably compromised
in the presence of CBP-93872 (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, CBP93872 did not suppress ATM activation (phosphorylation of
ATM at S1981; ATM pS1981) and subsequent phosphorylation
of Chk2 after IR treatment. In addition, this drug did not affect
Chk1 phosphorylation upon UV, MMS, or HU treatment (Fig.
1D–F). Taken together, these results suggested that the cellular
target of CBP-93872 should exist downstream of DSB-induced
ATM activation.
CBP-93872 does not inhibit initiation but does inhibit
maintenance of the DSB-induced G2 checkpoint
To examine the mode of G2 checkpoint suppression by CBP93872, we examined the percentage of H3 pS10-positive cells by
ﬂow cytometry. Mitotic indices, in the presence of CBP-93872,
of HT29, A549, and NCI-H460 cells were signiﬁcantly decreased
at 1 hour after IR treatment, but increased at 16 hours (Fig. 2A).
In contrast, reduction of these indices in the presence of
caffeine or UCN-01 was only minimal at 1 hour and markedly
increased at 12 hours. In MCF7 cells that possess functional

p53, mitotic indices in the presence of CBP-93872 were continuously low. These results suggested that CBP-93872 abrogates maintenance of the G2 checkpoint, but not its initiation,
whereas caffeine and UCN-01 inhibit both its initiation as well
as its maintenance. Consistent with this, immunoblotting
revealed that the level of H3 pS10 in the presence of CBP93872 was reduced at 4 hours and was elevated again at 8 hours
after IR treatment (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the levels of H3 pS10
were almost constant in the presence of UCN-01 and KU-55933,
an ATM-speciﬁc inhibitor. As expected, KU-55933 inhibited IRinduced ATM pS1981 and subsequent phosphorylation of
Chk2. UCN-01 did not inhibit IR-induced ATM pS1981 and
Chk2 phosphorylation, but rather enhanced Chk1 phosphorylation at S317 and S345.
CBP-93872 suppresses DSB-induced ATR activation
We then examined whether CBP-93872 was inhibitory
upstream or downstream of ATR activation. ATR activation
was detected by its auto-phosphorylation at T1989 (25).

T1989 as well as Chk1 phosphorylation were readily detected
after doses of 1 Gy or more IR treatment (Fig. 3A). CBP-93872
strongly inhibited DSB-induced ATR activation and subsequent Chk1 phosphorylation. Importantly, UV treatment
activated ATR in a dose-dependent manner and this activation as well as UV-induced Chk1 phosphorylation were not
affected by the treatment with CBP-93872 (Fig. 3B). Treatment with CBP-93872 did not affect S-phase progression with
or without UV treatment, eliminating the possibility that the
inability of CBP-93872 to inhibit UV-induced Chk1 phosphorylation was an indirect consequence of an altered progression
of S phase (Supplementary Fig. S1). We then examined
whether CBP-93872 directly inhibited ATR activity. An in vitro
kinase assay using recombinant wild-type ATR and ATRIP
complex revealed that CBP-93872, even at a maximum concentration (200 mmol/L), failed to inhibit ATR activity whereas
VE-821, an ATR-speciﬁc inhibitor, did so effectively, indicating that CBP-93872 is not a direct inhibitor of ATR (Fig. 3C).
Taken together, a molecular target of CBP-93872 should
exist during the process occurring between ATM-dependent

generation of the ATR-activating DNA structure and ATR
activation.
CBP-93872 did not inhibit DNA-end resection at DSB sites
ATR activation in response to DSB requires conversion of
ATM-activating DSB structures into ATR-activating structures
(25, 26). DNA-ends at DSBs sites are rapidly processed by
nucleases in combination with CtIP, generating ssDNA and
a junction between ssDNA and dsDNA (27). ssDNA is bound by
RPA, forming nuclear foci. Therefore, we used an immunohistochemical analysis using anti-RPA2 antibodies to determine
whether CBP-93872 blocked DNA-end resection at DSB sites. In
control cells, RPA2 foci formation was readily detectable after
IR treatment. These nuclear foci were colocalized with gH2AX
foci, suggesting that RPA2 foci represented ssDNA regions
generated by DNA-end resection at DSB sites. Depletion of CtIP
almost completely compromised RPA2 foci formation (Fig.
4A). In contrast, RPA2 foci were readily detectable in cells
treated with CBP-93872. Interestingly, in response to DSB,
depletion of CtIP showed an abrogation of the G2 checkpoint
similar to that upon treatment with CBP-93872 (28). Depletion
of CtIP did not inhibit ATM autophosphorylation at S1981, but
it did compromise Chk1 phosphorylation at S317 and S345 and

RPA2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). As with the CBP-93872 treatment, DNA-end resection at DSB sites seemed to be required
for maintenance of the G2 checkpoint in response to DSB (Fig.
4C). These results suggested that molecular targets of CBP93872 exist between DNA-end resection and ATR activation.
CBP-93872 inhibited ATR-dependent phosphorylation of
Nbs1 at S343
Importantly, checkpoint activation, which is evaluated by
Chk1 phosphorylation, seemed to be dependent on either Nbs1
or Rad17 depending on the type of DNA damage. On UV
treatment, Chk1 phosphorylation at S317 and S345 was almost
completely abrogated when Rad17, but not Nbs1, was depleted,
whereas on IR treatment these phosphorylations were dependent on the presence of Nbs1 but not Rad17 (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Treatment with CBP-93872 speciﬁcally inhibited
NBS1-dependent, but not Rad17-dependent phosphorylation
of Chk1 at S317 and S345 upon IR treatment, showing that the
inhibitory effect of CBP-93872 was only a minimal in cells
depleted of Nbs1. Consistent with this, 2 distinct modes of ATR
activation have been recently proposed (29, 30). One is dependent on Rad17-TopBP1 circuitry and the other is dependent
on the ssDNA-bound MRN complex. The former has been

CBP-93872 (Fig. 5B), suggesting that this phosphorylation is
involved in the maintenance but not the initiation of the G2
checkpoint. Importantly, CBP-93872 did not affect the complex
formation of Nbs1 with Mre11 and Rad50 (Fig. 5B and C). CBP93872 speciﬁcally inhibited IR-induced, but not UV-induced
Nbs1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5C).
An Nbs1 mutant lacking RPA binding showed a defect in
maintenance of the G2 checkpoint
Given that RPA binding of Nbs1 is required for MRNmediated ATR activation (29), we asked whether an Nbs1
mutant lacking RPA binding (EDE mutant) would exhibit a
defect in the maintenance of the G2 checkpoint as with CBP93872 treatment. Depletion of Nbs1 resulted in the defect in
initiation and maintenance of the G2 checkpoint, as shown by
the fact that the mitotic index was not decreased at 1 hour and
was increased at 24 hours after IR treatment (Fig. 5D). Ectopic
expression of wild-type Nbs1 in endogenous Nbs1-depleted
cells restored the ability to arrest the cell cycle before mitosis,
even at 24 hours after treatment. In contrast, as with CBP93872 treatment, expression of the EDE mutant restored the
ability to initiate G2 arrest in response to DSB, but failed to
maintain it. Consistent with this, as with CBP-93872 treatment,
expression of the EDE mutant restored autophosphorylation of
ATM (ATM pS1981) at 1 hour, but failed in phosphorylation of
Chk1 at S345 at 24 hours (Fig. 5E). Complex formation of the
EDE mutant with Mre11 and Rad50 was conﬁrmed by immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting analysis using Mre11 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5F). Taken together, these results indicated
that a defect in MRN-dependent activation of ATR had a
similar phenotype to that seen with CBP-93872 treatment.

proposed to be involved in mechanisms underlying initiation
of ATR checkpoint signaling on a junction between ssDNA and
double-stranded DNA, and the latter to be involved in the
mechanism by which the ATR checkpoint signal is ampliﬁed on
ssDNA. Therefore, we hypothesized that DSB-induced phosphorylation of Nbs1 at S343 was at least in part caused by
activated ATR during ampliﬁcation of the checkpoint signal. As
shown in Fig. 5A, depletion of ATR strongly suppressed IRinduced Nbs1 phosphorylation at S343. Intriguingly, treatment
with CBP-93872 also markedly inhibited this phosphorylation.
Analysis of the kinetics of DSB-induced Nbs1 phosphorylation
revealed that phosphorylation increased at 2 hours and
reached a maximum at 4 to 8 hours, which was inhibited by

www.aacrjournals.org

CBP-93872 directly inhibited ssDNA-induced ATR
activation in vitro
Finally, we examined whether CBP-93872 suppressed
ampliﬁcation of ATR checkpoint signaling on ssDNA or the
ssDNA/dsDNA junction using a recently developed in vitro
assay (29). In this system, ssDNA or the ssDNA/dsDNA
junction alone when incubated with nuclear extract was
sufﬁcient to induce RPA2 S33 phosphorylation and this
phosphorylation was dependent upon ATR, TopBP1, and
Nbs1. CBP-93872 inhibited RPA2 phosphorylation at S33 in
the nuclear extract incubated with ssDNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A, left). However, CBP-93872 did not
affect RPA phosphorylation at S33 in the extract incubated
with the ssDNA/dsDNA junction (Fig. 6A, right). In addition,
treatment with CBP-93872 in HT29 cells strongly suppressed
RPA2 phosphorylation at S33 (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these
results suggested that CBP-93872 directly inhibited ampliﬁcation of ATR checkpoint signaling by suppressing ssDNAdependent activation of ATR.

Discussion
Numerous G2 checkpoint inhibitors have been developed
and many have been proposed as potent candidates for DSB
sensitization of p53-deﬁcient cancer cells on the basis of the
concept that survival of p53-mutated cancer cells relies on the

Chk1-mediated G2 checkpoint upon DSB. For example, Chk1
seems to be a promising target because this kinase is essential
for G2 arrest in response to various genotoxic stressors. Several
small molecules exhibiting inhibitory activity toward Chk1
have been identiﬁed, such as UCN-01 (14). ATM and ATR are
also candidates as targets of G2 checkpoint inhibitors. In
addition, a Wee1 inhibitor, MK-1775, has been developed as
a potentiator of DNA damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy (31). However, the majority of these inhibitors interact with
the ATP binding site of the kinase and it would be difﬁcult to
obtain highly selective ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors as
the ATP binding site has a very similar structure in all kinases.
Furthermore, in normal cells, most of their molecular targets
play a key role in the survival and maintenance of genomic
integrity. Therefore, these inhibitors can easily cause unexpected deleterious effects on normal cell function, diminishing
the possibility of their clinical application.

Cancer Res; 74(14) July 15, 2014

To obtain G2 checkpoint inhibitors with a novel mode of
action, a high-throughput screening system using p53-deﬁcient HT29 cells was used and CBP-93872 was identiﬁed as a
potential candidate for use as a G2 checkpoint inhibitor,
although the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition
are largely unknown. In this study, we found that CBP-93872
inhibited ATR activation speciﬁcally following DSB. ATR activation in response to DSB requires ATM activation and the
subsequent processing of DSB ends by nucleases, generating
ssDNA regions and ssDNA/dsDNA junctions that function as
ATR-activating structures. Importantly, although ATR and
ATM themselves play key roles in cell survival and maintenance of genomic integrity, respectively, during the normal cell
cycle (19, 22), the molecular pathway between ATM activation
and ATR activation seems not to be essential for normal cell
growth. Therefore, molecules that target this pathway would
be most the desirable for use as drugs, because they have far

Figure 5. CBP-93872 inhibited ATR-mediated Nbs1 phosphorylation at S343, and a mutant Nbs1 lacking the ability to bind to RPA2 showed a similar
G2 checkpoint abrogation to that with CBP-93872 treatment. A, HT29 cells were infected with Tet-on inducible lentiviruses expressing shControl or
shATR. These cells were cultured in the presence of doxycycline (1 mg/mL) for 3 days. Cells were treated with or without IR (10 Gy) in the presence or absence of

antitumor efﬁciency of DNA-damaging agents.
Very recently, it was reported that ATR activation following
DSB is regulated by two distinct modes (29, 30). After DNA-end
resection is initiated, the Rad17–RFC complex recognizes
generated ssDNA/dsDNA junctions and subsequently recruits
Rad9–Rad1–Hus1 (9-1-1) complexes and TopBP1 onto the
junctions. This recruitment leads to the initiation of ATR
activation. Continued DNA-end resection results in lengthened

ssDNA regions that recruit RPA and ATR-ATRIP. MRN complexes then directly bind to RPA-ssDNA through the EDE
domain of Nbs1 and recruit TopBP1, activating ATR-ATRIP.
This mode of action seems to function in the ampliﬁcation and
maintenance of ATR checkpoint signaling (32). CBP-93872
speciﬁcally inhibited maintenance, but not initiation, of ATR
checkpoint signaling, suggesting that it functions in Nbs1dependent ATR activation (Fig. 6C). Intriguingly, CBP-93872
directly inhibited ssDNA-induced but not ssDNA/dsDNA

treatment with CBP-93872 suppressed ATR-dependent Nbs1

In conclusion, although the detailed mechanism underlying
inhibition of ssDNA-induced ATR activation by CBP-93872,
including its structural basis, remains elusive, our results
showed that ssDNA-induced ATR activation is a promising
molecular target for a G2 checkpoint inhibitor that speciﬁcally
sensitizes p53-mutated cancer cells to DSB-inducing DNA

schematical presentation of the
molecular basis underlying
checkpoint inhibition by CBP93872. ATR activation following
DSB is regulated by two distinct
modes. After DNA-end resection is
initiated, Rad17-(9-1-1)-TopBP1
leads to the initiation of ATR
activation. Continued DNA-end
resection recruits RPA–Nbs1
complexes and further activates
ATR. ATR activation following
ssDNA or cross-linking DNA
generated by DNA damage or
stalled DNA replication is mainly
mediated by the Rad17-(9-1-1)TopBP1 axis independently of
Nbs1. In this way, CBP-93872
speciﬁcally inhibits Nbs1dependent ATR activation.
