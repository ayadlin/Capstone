BACKGROUND. ABT-510 is a substituted nonapeptide that mimics the antiangiogenic activity of the endogenous protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). The current
study was designed to establish the safety of ABT-510 in the treatment of patients
with advanced malignancies on a once-daily (QD) and twice-daily dosing
schedule.

METHODS. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 dosing regimens: 20 mg,
50 mg, or 100 mg QD or 10 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg twice daily. ABT-510 was administered by subcutaneous bolus injection in cycles of 28 days. Tumor response

and disease progression were monitored at 8-week intervals by computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging.

RESULTS. Thirty-six patients were randomly assigned in equal numbers to the 6
study regimens, with an additional 13 patients randomized to the 10-mg-twicedaily and 50-mg-twice-daily ABT-510 regimens. The expected pharmacokinetic
target was achieved at all dose levels tested. The majority of adverse events were
grade 1 or 2 (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
[version 2]) and were not found to be dose related. The most frequently reported
adverse events that were possibly related to ABT-510 included injection site reactions, asthenia, headache, and nausea. Grade 3 events considered to possibly be
related included nausea, dyspnea, bone pain, constipation, vomiting, asthenia,
and chills and tremors. One partial response was observed in a patient with carcinosarcoma who received 20 mg QD. The 6-month progression-free survival rate
was 6%. Approximately 42% of patients (21 of 50 patients) had stable disease for
3 months.

CONCLUSIONS. ABT-510 can be administered at doses of 20 mg/day to 100 mg/
day without significant toxicity. In the current study, minimal antitumor activity

here is abundant evidence that primary tumor growth and metastatic progression require new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis).1 Tumors secrete multiple inducer proteins, including basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), that activate microvascular endothelial cells, causing
them to proliferate, migrate, and organize into capillary structures.2
Activated endothelial cells also enhance malignant progression by
producing cytokines that inhibit programmed cell death (apoptosis).3

factor inhibitors cause significant tumor growth
delay.4,5 Antiangiogenic therapy targets genetically
stable endothelial cells; therefore, the resistance typically observed after cytotoxic chemotherapy is not
anticipated.6 Moreover, angiogenesis inhibitors should
not have the intrinsic toxicity of cytotoxic chemotherapy. These properties of angiogenesis inhibitors are
consistent with the goal of using such agents synergistically with conventional cytotoxic or hormonal therapies and using these agents for a prolonged term to
suppress tumor growth and metastasis.
To our knowledge, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)
was the first natural angiogenesis inhibitor to be discovered. TSP-1 is a large, multifunctional protein that
is transcriptionally activated by the tumor suppressor
gene product p537 in fibroblasts and by other tumor
suppressors in other cell types. Recent evidence indicates that the activity of TSP-1 depends on its interaction with the receptor CD36 or closely associated
proteins on the surface of endothelial cells.8 TSP-1
rapidly inhibits endothelial cell migration and
enhances the rate of endothelial cell apoptosis by p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase and activating caspase-3-like activity.9 Normal tissue expression of TSP1 limits neovascularization.10,11 TSP-1 is transcriptionally activated by the tumor suppressor gene product
p53, and therefore is down-regulated in p53-defective
tumors.12 In rodent tumor models, the ectopic overexpression of TSP-1 inhibits the malignant phenotype,
as does the direct administration of TSP-1 into the circulation. However, to our knowledge, the direct clinical use of TSP-1 has not been feasible because of its
large size and multiple functions.13-16
The antiangiogenic activity of TSP-1 has been
localized to the properdin (type-1) repeats within the
50,000-molecular weight N-terminal stalk region of
the protein.17 Small synthetic peptides from within
this region have only weak antiangiogenic activity,
but a single D-amino acid replacement, (D-iosleucine) of a particular properdin-region heptapeptide
was reported to enhance activity by 1000-fold.18 ABT510 is a parenterally available nonapeptide analog of
this substituted heptapeptide and mimics its antiangiogenic properties. It is soluble and stable in water
and is supplied for clinical use as an acetate salt in
5% dextrose solution.
Preclinical studies have indicated that ABT-510
exhibits the features of an antiangiogenic cancer
therapeutic. In vitro, ABT-510 inhibits the chemotactic VEGF-stimulated migration of human microvascular endothelial cells.19 In vivo, ABT-510
administered subcutaneously at a dose of 10 mg/kg/
day blocks the normal vascularization of mouse cornea in response to the surgical placement of VEGF or

3421

bFGF pellets.19 In addition, ABT-510 reportedly has
antitumor activity in several murine and human
xenograft models.19
In a single-dose phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, ABT-510 was found to be well tolerated at doses
up to 130 mg (Abbott Laboratories IND 63,154).
Adverse events were generally mild in nature and of
uncertain clinical relevance. A maximum tolerated
dose was not identified. In a dose-escalating phase 1
study in patients with advanced cancer, doses of 100
mg to 260 mg per day administered as subcutaneous
bolus injections were evaluated. A dose of 260 mg per
day was determined to be the maximum clinically
practical dose because of the large injection volume
required (2 injections of 1.3 mL per day).
In preclinical models, doses of ABT-510 as low as
0.3 mg/kg/day demonstrated significant antitumor
activity. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
modeling of preclinical efficacy identified a minimum pharmacokinetic target of plasma concentrations exceeding 100 ng/mL for 3 hours.20 Human
pharmacokinetic modeling suggests ABT-510 doses
as low as 20 mg/kg/day would achieve these exposures in humans.
The purpose of the current study was to establish the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of ABT510 when administered at doses designed to target
the minimum plasma concentrations required for
antitumor activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This phase 1, randomized, open-label, dose-ranging
study of ABT-510 was conducted at 2 sites of the Arizona Cancer Center. The primary objective of the
study was to establish the safety profile of 3 doses of
ABT-510 in patients with advanced malignancies when
administered as once-daily (QD) or twice-daily subcutaneous bolus injections. The secondary endpoints
were to correlate pharmacokinetics with pharmacodynamic markers and to evaluate antitumor activity in
treated patients. Patients were recruited between January 3, 2002 and April 14, 2004. The institutional review
board of the University of Arizona reviewed and
approved the study, and all patients provided written
informed consent before study enrollment.
Patient Selection
Patients were required to be aged 18 years and
have a measurable, histologically or pathologically
documented advanced solid tumor that was refractory to standard therapy and for which there was no
effective life-prolonging therapy. Patients were also
required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology

Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 to 2 and a
predicted life expectancy 3 months. Patients were
not to have received antitumor radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational drugs
within 4 weeks or antitumor hormonal therapy
within 1 week of ABT-510 administration. Patients
were to be clinically stable and capable of receiving
subcutaneous injections. Patients with clinically significant disease unrelated to the primary malignancy
and those with primary brain tumors or previously
treated central nervous system metastases were
excluded from participation. Pregnant or lactating
women were also excluded. Strictly defined clinical
laboratory parameters were not included as part of
the eligibility criteria. Additional eligibility decisions
used the clinical judgment of the investigator based
on the patient’s medical history, physical examination, and laboratory profile.

Treatment Plan
Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment
regimens: 20 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg QD or 10 mg, 25
mg, or 50 mg twice daily. At least 6 patients who met
the enrollment criteria were enrolled into each dose
cohort. ABT-510 was originally supplied in 5% dextrose in single-use vials at 100 mg/mL (1.1 mL/vial).
Later supplies were produced at 40 mg/mL (0.75
mL/vial). ABT-510 was self-administered as a subcutaneous bolus injection. Patients were dosed for 28
consecutive days, after which they were allowed to
continue into an extension period at their current
dose and regimen, provided their safety assessments
were acceptable. At the time of completion of the
enrollment of 36 patients, additional patients were
scheduled for randomization in equal numbers to
the 10-mg-twice-daily and 50-mg-twice-daily ABT510 regimens to further evaluate the safety of these 2
doses, which were chosen to be evaluated in phase 2
studies based on their pharmacokinetic profiles and
preliminary efficacy data.
Study Evaluation
Patients were screened over a 14-day period; tumor
assessments were made within 4 weeks of the initiation of the study. Patients visited the study site for
assessment weekly during the first 28 days, then at
Weeks 6 and 8, and monthly thereafter. Tumor
response and disease progression as defined by
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
were monitored using either computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging every 8 weeks. Blood
samples for serial pharmacokinetic evaluations were
collected on Days 1 and 22. Plasma concentrations of
ABT-510 were measured using a liquid chromatogra-

phy with a mass spectrometric detection (liquid chromatography followed by mass spectroscopy/mass
spectroscopy in tandem [LC/MS/MS]) assay method
developed by Abbott Laboratories. Serial blood samples for the pharmacodynamic analysis of circulating
endothelial cells (CECs) were obtained before dosing
on Days 1 and 22, at Week 8, every 8 weeks thereafter,
and at the time of the final visit. The number and percentage of patients reporting treatment-related adverse
events were tabulated using the fifth edition of Coding
Symbols for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms
(COSTART), with a breakdown by dosage and dosing
frequency (QD or twice daily).
Patients were withdrawn from the study if any of
the following events occurred: disease progression;
the patient requested withdrawal; >1 dose reduction
or interruption in administration of the study drug
was required; radiotherapy, surgery, or therapy with
alternate antineoplastic agents was initiated; the
patient became pregnant; or the investigator believed
that it was in the best interest of the patient to discontinue treatment with the study drug. Procedures
outlined for the final visit were to be completed
within 72 hours of the last dose of study drug.

Quantification of CECs
Blood was collected by standard peripheral venipuncture into a Vacutainer (BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ) containing acid citrate dextrose (ACD) and
assayed for CECs within 24 hours of collection by
flow cytometry. A total of 100 lL of ACD anticoagulated blood was incubated with 10 lL of anti-CD31PE (BD PharMingen), 10 lL of anti-CD45-FITC (BD
PharMingen, San Diego, Calif), and 10 lL of a 4-lg/
lL solution of LDS-751 (Molecular BioProducts, Inc,
San Diego, Calif). Tubes were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and then 100 lL of a 5X
solution of BD FACS lysing solution (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, Calif) was added to lyse erythrocytes and
fixate cells. Tubes were analyzed within 4 hours on a
BD FACScan (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calf). CECs
were defined as a population of nucleated cells (positive LDS-751 staining) that were negative for the hematopoietic marker CD45 and positive for the
endothelial cell marker CD31 (PECAM). The number
of CECs/lL of whole blood was determined by the
following equation: (white blood cell count/lL) 3
(%CEC/100).
Pharmacokinetic and Statistical Analysis
Concentration-time profiles throughout the dosing
interval were determined for each subject by fitting a
compartmental pharmacokinetic model to the
observed data. Noncompartmental methods were

cycle without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities
(DLTs). Three patients discontinued the study prematurely secondary to adverse events unrelated to ABT510. Of the 50 patients enrolled in the study, all
50 (100%) experienced at least 1 treatment-related
adverse event. A total of 441 nonserious adverse
events were reported. The majority of events (90%)
were mild to moderate (grade 1-2) in severity.
Approximately 76% of these events were determined
to be not related (61%) or most likely not related
(15%) to ABT-510 therapy. The most frequent ABT510-related adverse events included mild injection
site reactions, asthenia, headache, and nausea (Table
3). Injection site reactions were typically mild and
characterized by a 1-cm to 2-cm erythematous lesion
associated with mild pruritis that lasted approximately 1 hour after injection.
A total of 32 serious adverse events were
reported in 14 patients. Three of the events—dehydration, vomiting, and a gastrointestinal bleed—were
experienced by patients undergoing screening evaluation before exposure to the study drug and therefore were not considered to be related to the study
drug. Of the remaining 29 events, none was considered by the investigators to be possibly or most likely
related to the administration of ABT-510 and were all
believed to be related to the patient’s underlying
malignancy. No deaths were reported during the
current study.

Five patients in this study experienced a total of
7 grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events that were considered possibly or most likely related to ABT-510. These
events included bone pain (1), constipation (1), nausea and vomiting (1), chills (1), aggravation of existing anemia (1), aggravation of existing asthenia (1),
and dyspnea (1). None of these adverse events were
considered to be serious.
A total of 12 grade 3 or grade 4 laboratory
abnormalities were identified in 8 patients in the
study; 1 abnormality was reported as an adverse
event. Three patients experienced lymphopenia
during treatment with ABT-510; however, 1 of the
patients entered the study with grade 3 lymphopenia
that did not significantly change during the course of
therapy. Other laboratory findings found to occur in
>1 patient were hyperglycemia in 2 patients and
hypokalemia in 2 patients.

Pharmacokinetics
ABT-510 pharmacokinetics were determined in all 50
patients. The pharmacokinetic data are summarized
in Table 4. The mean ABT-510 plasma concentrationtime profiles are presented in Figure 1.
When administered as a subcutaneous bolus
injection, ABT-510 was rapidly absorbed, with a Tmax
of approximately 0.5 hours. Thereafter, ABT-510 concentrations decreased, with a t1/2 of approximately

Across regimens, there were no statistically significant trends with dose noted in the ABT-510 dosenormalized AUC, Tmax, or b (P  .07). The dose-normalized ABT-510 Cmax on Day 1 decreased somewhat
with increasing dose (approximately 20% from 10 mg
to 100 mg; P  .03). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the dose-normalized
ABT-510 Cmax noted between the 10-mg and 100-mg
dose groups (P 5 .12). There was no statistically significant trend with dose noted in the Tmax, or dosenormalized ABT-510 Cmax on Day 22 (P  .11). The
ABT-510 dose-normalized Cmax and dose-normalized
AUC decreased with increasing weight (approximately 50% from 50 kg to 100 kg; P  .01). Females
had larger b values than males (P 5 .01); however,
ABT-510 t1/2 values averaged between 1 hour to
1.5 hours for both sexes. ABT-510 pharmacokinetics
were similar on Day 1 and Day 22. Variability in the
ABT-510 pharmacokinetics between individuals was

relatively low. Across dose groups, coefficients of variation in the ABT-510 Cmax and AUC averaged
approximately 40%. After multiple subcutaneous
bolus doses in patients with cancer, ABT-510 clearance (CL/F) averaged 22 L/hour (mean  standard
deviation; N 5 12) and the apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) averaged 33 L.

coma of the parotid gland and metastases in the
lung who received 20 mg of ABT-510 QD had a confirmed partial response beginning at the 8-week tumor evaluation; the response was equivalent to an
overall decrease in tumor volume of >60% at the 56week assessment. This patient remained on study for
65 weeks until disease progression.
CECs were quantified in patients at baseline, at
Week 3, at Week 8, and at the time of disease progression. Of the 165 specimens drawn for CEC analysis, only 114 were considered interpretable (69%),
with the remaining specimens considered to be
uninterpretable secondary to poor specimen viability
(25%) or protocol deviations (6%). For comparison of
CEC trends over time, patients were divided into 2
groups: those patients with rapid disease progression
as defined as remaining on study 8 weeks (n 5 29
patients) versus patients who remained on study for
>12 weeks (n 5 14 patients). There was no statistical

difference noted with regard to the median number
of CECs/lL at baseline for patients with rapid disease progression versus those who were on study for
>12 weeks (27 CECs/lL vs 18 CEC/lL). However, at
the later time points of 3 weeks and 8 weeks, there
was a suggestion of increasing CECs in those patients
whose disease progressed rapidly versus those who
remained on study for >12 weeks (Fig. 3). The difference in CEC levels did not reach statistical significance (P 5 0.2); however, the number of blood
samples from the patients who remained on study
>12 weeks was small.

DISCUSSION
The results of the current phase 1 study demonstrated that ABT-510 can be administered at doses
ranging from 20 mg/day to 100 mg/day without significant toxicity. The pharmacokinetic target thresh-

old of ABT-510 (ie, ABT-510 at 100 ng/mL for a
minimum of 3 hours per day) was achieved for all
the dose regimens evaluated in this study. No DLT
was observed at the doses and schedules studied.
In animal toxicology studies, ABT-510 is reported
to have a favorable profile.20 The only significant toxicity noted was renal tubular epithelial damage,
which was observed in rats in whom ABT-510 was
administered by bolus injection at a dose of 75 mg/
kg/day for 1 week. No toxicities were observed in
rats or monkeys at Cmax and plasma exposures
(AUCs) >10-fold higher than those observed at the
highest clinical dose tested.
ABT-510 has been administered to >300 patients
with cancer at doses ranging from 20 mg to 260 mg
per day for up to 17 months.21-25 Overall, the safety
profile has been favorable. The majority of adverse
events related or possibly related to ABT-510 have
been reported as grade 1 or 2 toxicities (mild or
moderate). Those toxicities considered possibly or
most likely related to ABT-510 were injection site
reaction (100%), asthenia (52%), nausea (34%), and
headache (35%). To our knowledge, no correlation
between dose and adverse events has been identified
to date, and a maximally tolerated dose has not been
determined. No laboratory abnormalities related to
ABT-510 have been reported in ongoing advanced
cancer studies. To our knowledge, there also has
been no evidence of drug-related renal toxicity, myelosuppression, or hypertension, toxicities that are
commonly associated with other antiangiogenic
agents, observed to date. Dose escalation was

stopped at 260 mg per day, the maximum clinically
practical dose.
ABT-510 pharmacokinetics were found to be dose
proportional and independent of time across the
range tested. After subcutaneous dosing, ABT-510 was
rapidly absorbed, with the Cmax most frequently
observed 0.5 hours after dosing. ABT-510 was eliminated with a t1/2 of approximately 1 hour. The minimal accumulation of plasma concentrations after QD

and twice-daily dosing was consistent with the t1/2
and stable pharmacokinetics over time. In the current
study, ABT-510 pharmacokinetics were similar to
those previously observed in healthy subjects and in
prior studies of patients with advanced cancer.21 All
ABT-510 dose regimens administered in the current
study achieved the potential pharmacokinetic endpoint of maintaining plasma concentrations >100 ng/
mL for at least 3 hours per day,20 ranging from 3.6
hours per day for the 20-mg-QD dose to 10.9 hours
per day for the 50-mg-twice-daily dose schedule.
Although to our knowledge ABT-510 drug-drug
interaction studies have not been conducted in
human patients to date, the effects of ABT-510 on
cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity have been evaluated
in vitro. At concentrations of 30 lM (approximately
30 lg/mL), ABT-510 did not alter cytochrome P450dependent monooxygenase activities in pooled
human liver microsomes, including CYP3A, 2D6, 2A6,
2C9, 2C19, 2E1, and 1A2.19 Metabolism-based interactions are not anticipated between ABT-510 and
drugs whose clearance is mediated predominately
via metabolism by these cytochromes.
Preliminary data on tumor assessment for the 50
patients who received ABT-510 indicate that 28
patients (56%) had stable disease at the 8-week tumor evaluation, 10 patients (20%) had stable disease
at the 16-week tumor evaluation, and 6 patients
(12%) had stable disease at the 24-week evaluation.
Minimal single-agent activity was observed that may
be secondary to the cytostatic nature of antiangiogenic agents, the redundancy of antiangiogenic pathways in heavily pretreated patients and those with
refractory disease, or the inactivity of the drug at the
doses or schedules tested. This level of antitumor activity is similar to the results obtained with other
antiangiogenic agents in monotherapy phase 1/2
clinical trials, including bevacizumab.26-28 Although
the data are limited, stabilization in the number of
CECs also appeared to be correlated with prolonged
disease stabilization in the patients in the current
study and suggests that our results with ABT-510
treatment may be secondary to antiangiogenic rather
than other antitumor effects. Other groups have
documented that decreases in CEC levels are correlated with responses to antiangiogenic therapies
while increasing levels are predictive of progressive
disease.29-31 To our knowledge the best method or
subgroup of CECs for monitoring antiangiogenic
effects is still controversial.32,33 Recent publications
have suggested that analysis of the apoptotic fraction
of CECs or measurement of CEC precursors (CEP)
may be superior biomarkers for antiangiogenesis
monitoring rather than quantification of the total

number of CECs.34,35 CEC levels also can decrease in
response to effective antitumor therapies that do not
target angiogenesis and thus alternative mechanisms
for disease stabilization observed with ABT-510 therapy are possible.
In summary, the thrombospondin-mimetic peptide ABT-510 is a potent, pleiotropic inhibitor of
angiogenesis. The pharmacokinetic profile of ABT510 makes it appropriate for once-daily or twicedaily subcutaneous injection, and ABT-510 has an acceptable safety profile when administered using daily
subcutaneous bolus injection in patients with cancer.
The toxicities associated with other antiangiogenic
agents, including hypertension and proteinuria, have
not been observed to date with the use of ABT-510.24
Future phase 2 studies in both solid tumors and
hematologic malignancies therefore are justified. The
safety and metabolic profile of ABT-510 make it an
attractive agent for use in combination with cytotoxic
chemotherapy. It is in this role, combined with
chemotherapy for use as first-line or second-line
treatment of solid tumors, that we will best determine its ultimate efficacy as an antiangiogenic agent.
