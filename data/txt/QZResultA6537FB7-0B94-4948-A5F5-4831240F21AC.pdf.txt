ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal cancers, has very poor 5-year survival
partly due to gemcitabine resistance. Recently, it was reported that chemotherapeutic
agents may act as stressors to induce adaptive responses and to promote
chemoresistance in cancer cells. During long-term drug treatment, the minority of
cancer cells survive and acquire an epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype with
increased chemo-resistance and metastasis. However, the short-term response of most
cancer cells remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the short-term response
of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine stress and to explore the corresponding
mechanism. Our results showed that gemcitabine treatment for 24 hours enhanced
pancreatic cancer cell invasion. In gemcitabine-treated cells, HAb18G/CD147 was upregulated; and HAb18G/CD147 down-regulation or inhibition attenuated gemcitabineenhanced invasion. Mechanistically, HAb18G/CD147 promoted gemcitabine-enhanced
invasion by activating the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)-STAT3 (signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3) signaling pathway. Inhibition of EGFRSTAT3 signaling counteracted gemcitabine-enhanced invasion, and which relied on
HAb18G/CD147 levels. In pancreatic cancer tissues, EGFR was highly expressed and
positively correlated with HAb18G/CD147. These data indicate that pancreatic cancer
cells enhance cell invasion via activating HAb18G/CD147-EGFR-pSTAT3 signaling. Our
findings suggest that inhibiting HAb18G/CD147 is a potential strategy for overcoming
drug stress-associated resistance in pancreatic cancer.

investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved
in gemcitabine resistance is urgently needed for developing
successful treatments for pancreatic cancer.
Currently, chemo-radiotherapy is the standard
cytocidal therapy, which primarily concerns on the ability
of a drug to induce cancer cell death. Researchers have
focused on developing therapeutic agents that are more
effective to eliminate the maximum number of tumor
cells [4]. Unfortunately, although great achievements
were reached in the beginning, recent studies have
revealed that current therapeutic approaches that aim to
eradicate the primary tumor may only have short-term
benefits and eventually lead to increased tumor cells

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly
aggressive solid tumor and the fourth cause of cancer-related
death [1]. Despite new therapeutic strategies, PDAC has a
5-year survival of less than 5% and a median survival of just
over 6 months [2]. Surgical resection is rarely possible for
advanced PDAC; thus, the genotoxic DNA-damaging agent
gemcitabine has historically been the first-line therapeutic
agent. However, most patients with unresectable PDAC
either do not respond or respond transiently and modestly
to gemcitabine and ultimately die because of therapeutic
resistance and subsequent metastatic disease [3]. Therefore,

resistance and metastasis [4, 5]. For example, multiple
metastases are induced by the VEGFR kinase inhibitor
sunitinib/SU11248 or VEGFR-speciﬁc antibodies [6, 7],
and the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 induces metastasis
in RAS- or BRAF-mutant melanoma [8]. We have also
observed post-radiation tumor recurrence in pancreatic
cancer [9]. The failure of current therapeutic approaches
is partly due to a lack of understanding of the molecular
signaling pathways utilized by cancer cells to actively
respond to therapeutic pressures [4, 10]. Accumulating
evidence has indicated that chemo-radiotherapy may not
kill all the cancer cells but may act as a stressor on the
surviving cells, inducing active counter-defense responses
that protect cells from drug stress and lead to drug
resistance through selection [11, 12]. Thus, elucidating the
mechanisms by which tumor cells counteract drug stress
may contribute to the development of therapeutic agents
that reverse gemcitabine resistance.
Based on the severity and duration of stress, drugs
can force cells to adapt, escape, or die. Specifically,
cells can succumb to drug stress via apoptosis when the
stress is harsh and the protective response is unsuccessful
(apoptosis), cells can survive and adjust to the original site
when the stress is persistent and less severe via a series of
protective responses (stay and adapt), or cells can move
from a hostile niche to a more favorable one when the
stress is less severe without eliciting a protective response
(avoid and escape) [5, 10]. Due to genetic and epigenetic
instability, malignant tumor cells are predisposed to resist
drug stress via adaptation procedures or stress avoidance
mechanisms. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
a hallmark of cancer metastasis, is a typical adaptive
response to therapeutic induced-DNA damage. EMT
influences the cellular sensitivity to gemcitabine and
endows pancreatic cancer cells with a drug resistance
phenotype [13]. Chemotherapy-induced cell death
generally occurs with 48 hours of treatment [14]; however,
EMT confers to improved cell survival over a long-term
adaptation, which is usually detectable after 3-4 days of
treatment. Simply interfering with EMT cannot effectively
alter the treatment response, as EMT occurs after
tumor cell death decisions are made. Thus, identifying
the short-term cellular response to drug stress and
determining whether this short-term response promotes
chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer are important.
HAb18G/CD147, which belongs to the CD147
(also called EMMPRIN or basigin) family, is a cancerassociated biomarker for detection [15] and an effective
target for treatment [16, 17]. Licartin, an antibody against
HAb18G/CD147, has been approved to treat primary
hepatocellular carcinoma and to prevent tumor recurrence
after liver transplantation or radiofrequency ablation
in China [16, 17]. Our previous studies have shown
that HAb18G/CD147 facilitates cancer metastasis and
progression by inducing MMP secretion and cell motility
[18] and that HAb18G/CD147 promotes chemoresistance
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by functioning as a novel unfolded protein response
transducer in response to anti-cancer drug-induced
cellular stress [19]. HAb18G/CD147 expression also
correlates with other cellular stress responses, such as
EMT [20], autophagy [21], and anoikis resistance [22,
23], suggesting that HAb18G/CD147 may involve in
cellular responses to drug stress. Recently, others and we
reported that CD147 is overexpressed in highly aggressive
pancreatic cancer and acts as a novel upstream activator
in STAT3-mediated pancreatic tumor development [24,
25]. CD147 knock-down via RNA interference increases
the chemosensitivity of human pancreatic cancer cells to
gemcitabine [26]. Anti-CD147 antibodies have been used
as positron emission tomography probes for imaging [27]
or in gemcitabine-based combination therapy [28] for
pancreatic cancer. However, whether HAb18G/CD147 is
involved in the short-term stress response of pancreatic
cancer cells to gemcitabine is unclear.
This systematic study aimed to investigate the shortterm response of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine,
to explore the role of HAb18G/CD147 in this response
and to determine the corresponding molecular mechanism
of action. In response to short-term gemcitabine stress,
pancreatic cancer cells accelerate invasion by upregulating HAb18G/CD147 expression and activating
HAb18G/CD147 downstream of EGFR-pSTAT3
signaling. Thus, the activation of early cellular responses
protects pancreatic cancer cells from drug stress-induced
cell death and may facilitate tumor resistance to therapy.
Blocking the short-term response by inhibiting the
HAb18G/CD147 signaling pathway may provide a
novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming gemcitabine
resistance in pancreatic cancer.

RESULTS
Gemcitabine enhances the migration and
invasion of pancreatic cancer cells
We first determined the chemo-sensitivity of
pancreatic cancer cell lines to gemcitabine, which was
assayed by cell growth inhibition at 72 hours. The IC50
(drug concentration that caused 50% growth inhibition)
values for MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells were 0.03 ±
0.01 μM and 1.62 ± 0.91 μM, respectively (Supplementary
Figure S1A). For an optimal time course of gemcitabine
cytotoxicity, we treated MIA PaCa-2 cells for 8-72 hours
at concentrations of 0.1–10 μM. The cell relative viability
of all dosages was above 80% within 8-24 hours but was
below 60% beyond 24 hours (Supplementary Figure S1B).
Thus, to explore the short-term cellular response to drug
stress, we investigated the migration and invasion by
treating cells with 0.1-10 μM gemcitabine for 24 hours.
As PANC-1 cells were more resistant to gemcitabine, we
increased the minimum and maximum gemcitabine doses
to 1 μM and 100 μM. At the 24-hour time point when
62178

the cells were analyzed for migration and invasion, the
cell viability at different gemcitabine concentrations was
above 90% (Supplementary Figure S1C). However, the
migration potential of gemcitabine-treated cells increased
significantly in a dose-dependent manner compared to
untreated cells, with significant increases occurring at
10 μM for MIA PaCa-2 and at 10 μM and 100 μM for
PANC-1 cells (Figure 1). A similar increasing trend was
also observed in the invasion assay, with more significant
enhancement occurring at the same concentration. At 1
μM, gemcitabine did not significantly stimulate migration

but did enhance invasion in both PANC-1 and MIA
PaCa-2 cells, indicating that invasion potential was a more
obvious response to gemcitabine stress than migration. We
then adopted in vitro invasion assay as a representative
means to explore the short-term cellular response to
gemcitabine. Together, our results showed that pancreatic
cancer cells responded to short-term gemcitabine treatment
by enhancing migration and invasion, with more migration
and invasion occurring at higher concentration, indicating
a potential early active escape mechanism in response to
gemcitabine stress.

Figure 1: Gemcitabine enhances the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells
were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 μM gemcitabine for 24 hours and then were seeded on non-coated (migration) and Matrigel-coated
(invasion) upper chambers. Cells that migrated/invaded to the lower surface of the filter were fixed, stained, imaged, and counted in 10
random fields. Bars = 500 μm as indicated. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 compared with control.

HAb18G/CD147 is required for gemcitabineenhanced migration and invasion in pancreatic
cancer cells

protein levels after gemcitabine treatment. The protein
levels of pSTAT3, but not of total STAT3, increased in
a dose-dependent manner in both pancreatic cancer cell
lines after 24 hours of gemcitabine treatment (Figure
3A). The pSTAT3-specific inhibitor WP1066 inhibited
cell invasion in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal
inhibition occurring at 1 μM (Supplementary Figure
S3A). Moreover, 1 μM WP1066 significantly abolished
gemcitabine-enhanced invasion in both pancreatic cancer
cell lines, although the degree of inhibition differed
(Figure 3B). By contrast, WP1066 treatment resulted in
greater suppression of gemcitabine-related invasion in
MIA PaCa-2 cells (45%) than in PANC-1 cells (28%),
consistent with the fact that the pSTAT3 expression level
is higher in MIA PaCa-2 cells than in PANC-1 cells [24].
Therefore, pSTAT3 appears to be involved in gemcitabineenhanced migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer
cells.
In Figures 1, 2D and 2E, we noticed that
gemcitabine-resistant EGFR-mutant PANC-1 cells
exhibited greater gemcitabine-enhanced invasion than
gemcitabine-sensitive EGFR-wild type MIA PaCa-2 cells,
indicating that EGFR might be related to gemcitabineenhanced invasion. As STAT3 is activated by EGFR [31],
we examined whether EGFR is involved in gemcitabineenhanced invasion by activating STAT3. As shown in
Figure 3A, a dose-dependent increase in pEGFR, together
with pSTAT3, was observed in 0-10 μM gemcitabinetreated pancreatic cancer cells. However, unlike pEGFR,
total EGFR was not changed upon gemcitabine treatment.
Moreover, time-dependent increases in pEGFR and
pSTAT3 were observed in MIA PaCa-2 cells as early as 4
and 6 hours, respectively; both were later than the increase
in CD147, which occurred at 2 hours (Figure 3C). Treating
cells with the EGFR inhibitor PD153035 resulted in dosedependent inhibition of pSTAT3 levels, but not total
STAT3 levels (Supplementary Figure S3B), indicating
that EGFR is involved in gemcitabine-enhanced invasion
via STAT3. Thus, the EGFR-STAT3 signaling pathway
contributes to gemcitabine-enhanced invasion.

Recently, HAb18G/CD147 was shown to be highly
expressed in pancreatic cancer cells; and HAb18G/CD147
is widely involved in metastasis and chemoresistance and
correlates with cellular stress responses [24, 26]. Therefore,
we explored the role of HAb18G/CD147 in gemcitabineenhanced migration/invasion by exposing pancreatic
cancer cells to 0-10 μM gemcitabine for 24 hours. As
shown in Figure 2A and 2B and in Supplementary Figure
S2A, gemcitabine up-regulated HAb18G/CD147 protein
expression in a dose-dependent manner in both pancreatic
cancer cell lines, with the maximal enhancement occurring
at 10 μM gemcitabine. The up-regulation of HAb18G/
CD147 protein expression was also time-dependent;
increased HAb18G/CD147 protein expression occurred
as early as 12 hours, before the increases in migration and
invasion (Figure 2C). However, HAb18G/CD147 mRNA
expression was increased as late as 24 hours, indicating
a non-transcription-based mechanism for up-regulating
HAb18G/CD147 protein levels at 12 hours.
To further determine whether HAb18G/CD147
is required for gemcitabine-enhanced migration and
invasion, we adopted a loss-of-function strategy using
the pLKO lentiviral vector [24]. When HAb18G/CD147
expression was effectively silenced (typically 60-80%
reduction in protein expression), which was validated by
western blot and flow cytometry, gemcitabine-enhanced
invasion was significantly attenuated in both PANC-1
and MIA PaCa-2 cells (Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure
S2B). Moreover, the anti-HAb18G/CD147 monoclonal
antibody HAb18IgG (30 μg/mL) significantly counteracted
gemcitabine-enhanced invasion in both cell lines (Figure
2E, Supplementary Figure S2C). These results strongly
suggest that HAb18G/CD147 is required for gemcitabineenhanced migration/invasion in pancreatic cancer cells
and that HAb18G/CD147 correlates with the cellular
response to gemcitabine stress and the related resistance.
HAb18IgG effectively abolished gemcitabine-enhanced
migration/invasion, suggesting the therapeutic potential
of this antibody in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer.

HAb18G/CD147 activates pSTAT3 signaling via
EGFR
As shown above, HAb18G/CD147 and EGFR activate
STAT3 signaling, contributing to gemcitabine-enhanced
invasion. Therefore, we examined whether HAb18G/CD147
activates gemcitabine-enhanced pSTAT3 signaling via EGFR
or vice versa. As the time-dependent increase in pEGFR
occurred later than that in HAb18G/CD147, we deduced
that HAb18G/CD147 might activate pSTAT3 signaling
via EGFR. To elucidate this possibility, we knocked down
HAb18G/CD147 expression using siCD147 and then treated
cells with or without PD153035. As shown in Figure 3D,
pSTAT3 levels greatly decreased in both siCD147- and
PD153035-treated cells; and pSTAT3 levels further decreased

EGFR-STAT3 signaling is involved in
gemcitabine-enhanced migration and invasion
We recently reported that HAb18G/CD147 is an
upstream activator of STAT3 signaling in pancreatic
cancer; the STAT3 pathway is a critical pathway that is
activated in gemcitabine-resistant cells [24, 29]. STAT3
activity is also necessary for pancreatic cancer cell
invasion via MMP7 [30]. To investigate whether pSTAT3
is also involved in gemcitabine-enhanced migration
and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells, we examined
phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and total STAT3

in response to combined siCD147 and PD153035 treatment,
suggesting that the PD153035-induced decrease in the
pSTAT3 level correlated with HAb18G/CD147 expression.
As the CD147 activation and knock-down influenced the
pEGFR levels accordingly (Figure 3D), EGFR-activated
pSTAT3 signaling depended on HAb18G/CD147 levels.
To further explore the relationship between HAb18G/
CD147 and EGFR, we tested whether CyPA, a natural ligand
for HAb18G/CD147 [24], could up-regulate EGFR levels
in pancreatic cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4A, CyPA
stimulation caused dose- and time-dependent increases
in pEGFR levels. Next, we determined whether the above
CyPA effects were HAb18G/CD147 dependent or not
by knock-down or knock-in of CD147. Both EGFR and
pEGFR protein levels were reduced after HAb18G/CD147
knock-down; moreover, CyPA-induced pEGFR protein
expression was attenuated by HAb18G/CD147 knock-down
(Figure 4B). In contrast, EGFR and pEGFR protein levels
were significantly increased by HAb18G/CD147 knockin in HEK293 cells, indicating that the CyPA-mediated
increase in pEGFR/EGFR protein expression correlated with
HAb18G/CD147 levels. Using immunofluorescence staining,
we observed that both HAb18G/CD147 and EGFR were
evenly distributed on the cell membrane in control vectortransfected PANC-1 NTC cells. However, EGFR membrane
expression was significantly reduced after HAb18G/CD147
knock-down in A6 cells (Figure 4C). These results suggest
that HAb18G/CD147 activates EGFR protein expression and
phosphorylation.
To evaluate whether HAb18G/CD147 functionally
influences EGFR in pancreatic cancer cells, we
performed cell growth assays after exposing cells to
CyPA and the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib. Gefitinib (80
μM) significantly inhibited CyPA-induced cell growth
to the level of control in both cell lines (P = 0.0027 and
P = 0.0403 for MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1, respectively,
Figure 4D). Furthermore, the cell growth inhibition by
gefitinib correlated with HAb18G/CD147 levels: cell
growth decreased 1.96-3.95 fold in cells with HAb18G/
CD147 knock-down and increased 1.62-fold in cells with
HAb18G/CD147 knock-in (Figure 4E), indicating that
EGFR acts downstream of HAb18G/CD147 in pancreatic
cancer cells. Together, these results suggest that HAb18G/
CD147 contributes to gemcitabine enhanced-invasion via
activating EGFR-STAT3 signaling.

average compared to those in adjacent non-tumor tissues
(P = 0.0973, n = 7). Moreover, EGFR mRNA levels
significantly correlated with HAb18G/CD147 mRNA
levels (Spearman r = 0.8829, P = 0.0123, Figure 5B).
We then analyzed EGFR protein expression in
179 pancreatic tissues. In a pancreatic tissue microarray
(TMA) of 179 samples, EGFR was positively expressed in
20.8% (10/48) of normal pancreatic tissues and in 71.4%
(5/7), 66.7% (14/21) and 78.6% (81/103) of the chronic
pancreatitis, pancreatic preneoplasia and PDAC samples,
respectively (Figure 5C, Table 1). The positive ratios
of EGFR expression in chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic
preneoplasia and PDAC were significantly higher than
those in adjacent non-tumor tissues (P = 0.019, P < 0.001,
and P < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the intense staining
ratio of EGFR in PDAC (40.8%) increased by 1.43- and
2.15-fold compared with chronic pancreatitis (28.6%) and
pancreatic preneoplasia (19.0%), respectively, although
these differences did not reach statistical significance.
Next, we analyzed the co-expression of EGFR
and HAb18G/CD147 in 47 normal pancreas and 102
pancreatic cancer tissues with positive staining for both
antigens. As indicated in Table 2, a significantly higher
incidence of high expression of both EGFR and HAb18G/
CD147 was found in pancreatic cancer tissues compared
with normal tissues (71.57% [73/102] vs. 17.02% [8/47],
P < 0.001). The incidence of HAb18G/CD147highEGFRhigh
(71.57%) in pancreatic cancer tissues was significantly
higher than that of HAb18G/CD147lowEGFRlow (4.90%),
HAb18G/CD147high (15.69%), or EGFRhigh (7.84%) (P <
0.001 for all three groups). Furthermore, high HAb18G/
CD147 expression was significantly correlated with high
EGFR expression (Spearman r = 0.3086, P = 0.0016),
suggesting that the high expression levels of both
HAb18G/CD147 and EGFR might have important roles
in promoting pancreatic cancer progression.

HAb18G/CD147 is essential for gemcitabineenhanced invasion in mice
Above studies showed that short-term gemcitabine
exposure can rapidly enhance in vitro cell invasion
through up-regulating CD147 expression. Whether
this scenario actually existed in vivo is unclear yet.
Therefore, we examined the response of tumor cells to
gemcitabine chemotherapy in mice. MIA PACa-2 NTC
or CD147 knock-down A6 cells were inoculated into
ﬁve- to six-week-old female nude mice subcutaneously.
When tumors reached a mean volume of 100mm3, we
treated tumor-bearing mice with 100mg/kg gemcitabine
or saline. 24 hours later, tumor cells were isolated to
assess cell invasion. Our results showed that MIA PaCa2 NTC cells from the gemcitabine-treated mice gained
signiﬁcantly increased invasion ability and significantly
increase of CD147 membrane expression when compared
with MIA PaCa-2 NTC cells from the vehicle-treated

mice (Figure 5D and 5E). On the contrary, CD147 knockdown A6 cells from the gemcitabine-treated mice and the
vehicle-treated mice almost lost the invasion ability. This
result provides the in vivo evidence that gemcitabinetreatment induces an increase of the invasion ability of
tumor cells, and HAb18G/CD147 plays an important role
in tumor cells evasion of gemcitabine stress in vivo.

short-term gemcitabine stress, HAb18G/CD147 was upregulated and promoted invasion. Inhibition or blocking
HAb18G/CD147 via knock-down or antibody treatment
attenuated gemcitabine-enhanced invasion. We also found
that the EGFR-STAT3 signaling pathway was activated
in response to short-term gemcitabine treatment and
that inhibition of EGFR-STAT3 signaling counteracted
gemcitabine-enhanced invasion, which correlated with
HAb18G/CD147 levels. In pancreatic cancer tissues, high
HAb18G/CD147 expression was significantly correlated
with high EGFR expression, and high expression of both
HAb18G/CD147 and EGFR was observed in 71.57% of
pancreatic cancer samples. Taken together, these data
revealed that pancreatic cancer cells actively defend

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that pancreatic cancer
cells escape short-term gemcitabine-enhanced stress by
increasing invasion rather than by succumbing to stressinduced death or in situ adaptive survival. In response to

against gemcitabine stress by accelerating cell invasion
via activating HAb18G/CD147-EGFR-pSTAT3 signaling.
An antibody against HAb18G/CD147 could be a potential
therapeutic agent for overcoming gemcitabine stressassociated resistance in pancreatic cancer.
Our results and others’ show that current
therapies, such as the genotoxic DNA-damaging agent
gemcitabine, show efficacy in early stages of cancer
but may increase oncogenic characteristics such as
invasiveness and metastasis later on [32]. Normally, the
response to therapy (inhibition of growth and/or survival
of cancer cells) and selection for resistance will occur
simultaneously [33]. While therapy-induced killing of
cancer cells results in therapeutic response and cancer
remission, they simultaneously select for drug resistance
[11, 12]. These resistant cells proliferate, forming a
resistant tumor in relapse, accompanying by tumor
progression [33]. Actually, anticancer drugs may promote
the emergence of resistance and tumor recurrence [4,
12]. Thus, in addition to drug cytotoxicity, the cellular
responses to a given drug must also be considered. We
need to reach a balance between the cellular response to
a drug and the cytotoxic effects of a drug. Our results
clearly illustrate this point by revealing that gemcitabine
enhanced pancreatic cancer cell invasion and migration
in a dose-dependent manner, with greater invasion and
migration in response to higher doses of gemcitabine.
The drug stress stimulated invasion was altered
according to the intensity of the drug-related stress.
Hence, elucidating the mechanisms to counteract the
early responses of tumor cells to drug stress may provide
strategy for suppressing drug stress-associated resistance
while still attacking the cells and may provide further
predictive information for determining the response of
tumor cells to a particular drug.
Tumor cells evade or adapt in response to drug
stress. In this study, we observed increased cell invasion
after gemcitabine treatment for 24 hours, which enabled
cancer cells to escape drug-induced cell death; however,
we did not observe a typical change of EMT markers
expression (Supplementary Figure S4B). Our results
revealed another mechanism of stress-associated drug
resistance that results from a short-term stress escape
response; the increased invasion capability was the cause,
not the result, of drug resistance. Similar results were
also reported by Arora et al., who found that both the
up-regulation of CXCR4 expression and the subsequent
increased invasiveness served as counter-defense
mechanisms against gemcitabine [32]. These protective
evasion responses permit short-term cancer cell survival
before the onset of cell death and extend cell viability if
the environment becomes permissible. However, whether
the migrated cells can resist further long-term drug
treatment is unclear. Furthermore, the molecular circuits
that connect the cross-talk between early stress responses
and long-term adaptation remain poorly understood.

Gemcitabine, a genotoxic DNA-damaging agent,
directly incorporates into DNA or inhibits ribonucleotide
reductase to prevent DNA replication, thus inducing cell
death and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, gemcitabine has
been reported to inhibit pancreatic cell invasion at a low
dose of 50 nM [34, 35] or have no effect at a dose of 100
nM [36, 37]. However, gemcitabine at a higher dose of
10 μM in vitro or in a bolus injection at the maximum
tolerated dose of 500 mg/kg in vivo facilitated cell invasion
and accelerated metastasis in mice, respectively [32, 38,
39]. These results suggest that the cellular response to
short-term, high-dose chemotherapy promotes invasion
and metastasis, which is consistent with our present
results. In our study, PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were
treated with 1-10 μM gemcitabine, which significantly
increased the invasion capacities of both cell lines. The
doses of 1-10 μM are significantly higher than the IC50 of
gemcitabine in MIA PaCa-2 cells but are equal to the IC50
in PANC-1 cells. A relatively lower dose of gemcitabine
was used in PANC-1 cells than in MIA PaCa-2 cells, but
a greater increase in invasion was observed in PANC-1
cells. The different genetic backgrounds of the two cell
lines potentially explain this difference, i.e., PANC-1
cells express mutated EGFR, whereas EGFR is wild type
in MIA PaCa-2 cells. Taken together, both a higher dose
of gemcitabine and the genetic background of the cells
contribute to the in vitro active cellular stress response of
increased invasion.
We previously showed that the cell adhesion
molecule HAb18G/CD147 stimulates cellular stress
responses, such as unfold protein response [19], EMT
[20], autophagy [21], and anoikis resistance [22, 23]. In
this paper, we report that HAb18G/CD147 is up-regulated
in response to drug stress and is required for gemcitabineenhanced invasion. Furthermore, rather than being a
cell death signal, HAb18G/CD147 up-regulation was a
protective pro-survival response. In addition to cancer,
CD147 has been reported to protect neurons against in
vitro cholesterol and amyloid-b stress [40], oxidative and
ischemic injury [41] and focal cerebral ischemia [42]. All
these studies suggest that CD147 has a cytoprotective
role in response to various injuries, including drug stress
and that CD147 may be a stress response protein. To the
best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to
demonstrate that CD147 functions in chemoresistance
partly by actively responding to cellular stress, in addition
to its roles in regulating hyaluronan signaling [43] and
ABCG2 cellular localization and dimerization [44].
Regarding the mechanism of CD147 up-regulation,
our previous publication demonstrated that the HAb18G/
CD147 promoter contains a hypoxia-inducible factor
response element, which enables increased transcription in
response to hypoxia [45]. However, in our present study,
the up-regulation of CD147 occurred at the protein level,
specifically at the membrane protein level, indicating
a completely different scenario. As the up-regulation of
62187

Oncotarget

CD147 occurred as early as 2 hours post-gemcitabine
treatment, we can reasonably infer that the rapid recycling
of CD147 to the plasma membrane and impaired
degradation may contribute to this rapid induction [46].
Consequently, CD147 can respond quickly to drug stress
by influencing cell adhesion and migratory properties.
The detailed mechanism by which CD147 is rapidly upregulated remains under active investigation.
We previously reported that HAb18G/CD147
promotes pSTAT3-mediated pancreatic cancer progression
via CD44s [24]. In this study, we show that HAb18G/
CD147 contributes to gemcitabine stress-enhanced
invasion by activating pSTAT3, indicating a novel role for
CD147 in STAT3-mediated chemoresistance in addition
to promoting PDAC. Among the STAT3 upstream
membrane proteins that may associate with CD147, we
determined that EGFR was activated in response to shortterm gemcitabine treatment. Therefore, we propose that
in response to gemcitabine stress, pancreatic cancer cells
first up-regulate HAb18G/CD147 expression and then
activate EGFR-STAT3 signaling via phosphorylation
at tyrosine 705 to promote the transcription of STAT3
target genes, such as MMP and cyclin D1/survivin, and
ultimately to increase cell survival and invasion (Figure
5F). Our previous findings and literature both suggest that
HAb18G/CD147 activated EGFR signaling in pancreatic
cancer cells may depend on CD44 [24, 47]. For the
cellular response to gemcitabine stress, furthermore, we
actually observed a slightly increase of CD44 expression
upon gemcitabine treatment, as shown in Supplementary
Figure S4A. Therefore, the activation of EGFR signaling
by CD147 in gemcitabine-enhanced invasion process
possibly depended on CD44 expression.
In human pancreatic cancer, high EGFR expression
is required for both the initiation and survival of ADM
(and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia [PanIN]) lesions,
and EGFR ablation restricts the development of PDAC
[48]. Inhibiting EGFR signaling has also been reported to
improve the efficacy of gemcitabine in human pancreatic
tumor xenograft models [49]. Erlotinib, an EGFR kinase
inhibitor, sensitizes metastatic pancreatic cancer patients to
gemcitabine; the combination of erlotinib and gemcitabine
was approved as a therapy for PDAC based on a survival
benefit of approximately two weeks [50]. However, only
limited efficacy was shown [51]. Our study may provide
a strategy for counteracting gemcitabine stress-associated
resistance by inhibiting EGFR upstream signaling.
In conclusion, our study suggests that pancreatic
cancer cells actively respond to short-term gemcitabine
stress by inducing invasion via up-regulating HAb18G/
CD147 and activating downstream EGFR-pSTAT3
signaling. Our results will be valuable for obtaining a
better understanding of the flexibility and interplay of
the balanced biosystem between tumor cells and drug
stress and the powerful potential of tumor cells to adapt to
environmental stress. In addition, our results establish that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibiting HAb18G/CD147 before gemcitabine treatment
may provide a novel combination strategy to overcome
gemcitabine stress-associated resistance in pancreatic
cancer.

surface of the filter in 10 different areas using a Nikon
ECLIPSE Ti inverted light microscope (Pudong New
District, Shanghai, China). Each assay was performed in
triplicate in three separate experiments.

RNA interference

For the flow cytometric analysis, 106 cells were
incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-human CD147
antibody in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Gibco)
containing 2% FBS at 4°C for 30 min. Isotype-matched
mouse immunoglobulin served as the control. Samples
were analyzed using a FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer and
CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
As for flow cytometry analysis of EMT marker
staining, cells with or without gemcitabine treatment were
blocked with 1% BSA in PBS on ice for 30 min. The
cells were then incubated on ice with individual antibody
N-cadherin (1:100), SNAI1 (1:100), Vimentin (1:100)
for 1 h. After washing twice with PBS, goat anti-mouse
DyLight 488 or goat anti-rabbit DyLight 488 at a dilution
of 1:200 were incubated for another 30 min. Finally, cells
were suspended in PBS containing 2% FBS, and analyzed.

Flow cytometry analysis

Chemically synthesized, double-stranded CD147
siRNAs were purchased from GenePharma Co., Ltd
(Shanghai, China). The sequence for CD147 siRNA
(siCD147) is 5’- GUUCUUCGUGAGUUCCUCtt-3’ [18].
Silencer negative control siRNA (sncRNA) was used as a
negative control.

Cell growth assay
Cells were plated in 24- or 96-well plates; cell
viability was determined by using a hemocytometer or
by measuring WST-8 dye absorbance at 450 nm. For
cytotoxicity assays, cells were exposed to different
concentrations of gemcitabine. Chemo-sensitivity values
were expressed as IC50 values. To determine the growth
inhibition effect of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, cells were
serum-starved for 24 hours before the addition of 80 μM
gefitinib for one hour followed by a 72-hour treatment
with 100 nM CyPA. The results are presented as relative
cell growth inhibition normalized to their individual
controls. To determine the effect of CD147 knock-down
or knock-in on gefitinib-mediated growth inhibition, NTC
or A6 cells were treated with 80 μM gefitinib for 48 hours
and then analyzed. The cell growth inhibition ratio of
gefitinib is indicated with an arrow in the figures.

Western blot analysis
Whole cell extracts from cultured cells were
prepared by adding phos-RIPA lysis buffer (1 M TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 5 M NaCl, 0.01% NP-40, 0.5 M EGTA,
and 10% SDS) supplemented with Halt phosphatase
inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) and
complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN) to the cell monolayer. Proteins were separated on 10%
polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes.
Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk for 1 hour.
Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with each
individual antibody overnight at 4°C and then with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or antirabbit IgG for 2 hours. Finally, signals were developed
using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). To demonstrate
equal loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed
with a monoclonal antibody against b-actin or a-tubulin.

In vitro migration and invasion assay
In vitro migration and invasion assays were
performed using 24-well BioCoat Matrigel Invasion
Chambers (BD Biosciences Cat No. 354480) containing
BD Falcon Cell Culture Inserts with an 8-μm-diameter
pore size PET membrane that were coated without
(migration) or with (invasion) Matrigel matrix. To perform
the assays, the inserts containing Matrigel were hydrated
using 500 μL of warm culture medium without serum
at 37°C for 2 hours. After hydration, the medium was
removed from the chambers, and the inserts were placed
on top of each well containing 3-8×104 cells pre-treated
with gemcitabine or WP1066. Media containing 10%
FBS was added to the lower chamber, and the cells were
incubated for 16 hours. Cells that remained on the upper
surface of the insert membrane were completely removed
with a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated or invaded
through the membrane/Matrigel to the bottom of the insert
were fixed, stained with 0.2% crystal violet and imaged.
The invasive potential of the cells was determined by
counting the number of cells that had invaded to the lower

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were
performed as previously described [9]. qPCR ampliﬁcation
was performed using the Stratagene Mx3005P Multiplex
quantitative PCR system (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA) with gene-specific primers for HAb18G/CD147:
forward: 5’-TCGCGCTGCTGGGCACC-3’; reverse:
5’-TGGCGCTGTCATTCAAGGA-3’. Genes of interest
were normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S RNA:
forward: 5’-CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTC-3’; reverse:
5’-TTGGCAAATGCTTTCGCTC-3’. Relative mRNA
levels are presented as unit values of 2−ΔCt = 2−(Ct (HKG) − Ct (GOI)).

cases of normal pancreatic tissue and 7 cases of pancreatitis;
the “tumor tissue array” included 2 cases of PanIN, 4 cases
of cystadenoma, 15 cases of intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasm (IPMN) and 103 cases of PDAC.

Cells grown on chambered cover slips were fixed,
blocked and probed with the anti-HAb18G/CD147
antibody HAb18IgG and anti-EGFR antibody. The
signals were detected with fluorochrome-conjugated
FITC and Texas Red. Cover slips were counterstained
with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Invitrogen)
to visualize the nuclei. Cell images were observed
and acquired using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon
ECLIPSE Ti, Pudong New District, Shanghai, China).

Animal studies
All animal experiments were performed in
accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee approved protocols. For the localized
subcutaneous xenograft mouse model, 1×106 MIA
PACa-2 NTC or CD147 knock-down A6 cells in 0.2mL
DMEM were inoculated into ﬁve- to six-week-old
female nude mice subcutaneously. When tumors reached
a mean volume of 100mm3, mice were randomized
into four groups (n=5 mice per group). Tumor volume
was measured using vernier calipers twice a week and
the tumor volume was calculated using the formula
described by us previously [24]. Gemcitabine (100 mg/
kg) or saline (control group) was administered as a single
intraperitoneal injection. 24 hours later, the subcutaneous
tumors were harvested from the flanks of the mouse by
blunt dissection. Tumors were mechanically minced and
incubated at 37°C for 2 hours in the cell dissociation
buffer (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillinstreptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 200 U/mL
collagenase type IV (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 0.6
U/mL dispase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The cell
suspension was then passed through a 70-μm filter (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the cells were collected
for the invasion assay [52].

Immunohistochemistry staining
TMA staining was performed using standard
immunohistochemical staining procedures. To confirm
the specificity of the primary antibodies, tissue sections
were incubated with control mouse IgG in the absence of
primary antibody. The number of positively stained cells
and the intensity of positive staining on epithelium cells
were independently scored by 2 pathologists in a blinded
manner. The percentage of positive cells was scored as
follows: 0, 1-25%, 26-75% and > 75%. The intensity of
positive immunostaining was graded by an experienced
pancreatic pathologist in a blinded manner and was
classified into four categories: 0 (no visible staining),
1 (light brown staining), 2 (medium brown staining),
and 3 (dark brown staining), with the same intensity
covering more than 75% of the stained area. For tissue
samples with surface-bound HAb18G/CD147 and EGFR,
samples with no staining were classified as negative or
no staining; samples with 1+ staining in ≤ 50% of cells
or 2+ staining in ≤ 25% of cells were classified as light
staining; samples with 1+ staining in > 50% of cells, 2+
staining in 26-75% of cells or 3+ staining in ≤ 25% of cells
were classified as intermediate staining; and samples with
2+ staining in > 75% of cells or 3+ staining in > 25% of
cells were classified as intense staining. For the statistical
analysis, the stained tumor tissues were divided into two
groups: the low-expression group and the high-expression
group. The low-expression group included cases with a
negative staining intensity score; the high-expression
group included cases with staining intensity scores of light
staining, intermediate staining and intense staining.

Statistical analysis
All the data are presented as the mean ± SD
of triplicate values from three separate experiments.
Independent Student’s t tests or one-way ANOVAs were
used to compare the continuous variables between 2
groups or more than 2 groups, and categorical variables
were compared using the χ2 test. Spearman rank
correlation was conducted to analyze the correlation
between the expression of HAb18G/CD147 and EGFR
mRNA. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
13.0 (IBM) and Prism 5.0 (GraphPad). *P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
