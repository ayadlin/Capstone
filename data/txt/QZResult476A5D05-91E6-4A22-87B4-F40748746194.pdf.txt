ABSTRACT:
Mutations of the PI3K, TOR, iNOS, and NF-κB genes increase lifespan of model
organisms and reduce the risk of some aging-associated diseases. We studied the
effects of inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin), TOR (rapamycin), iNOS (1400W), NFκB (pyrrolidin dithiocarbamate and QNZ), and the combined effects of inhibitors:
PI3K (wortmannin) and TOR (rapamycin), NF-κB (pyrrolidin dithiocarbamates) and
PI3K (wortmannin), NF-κB (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamates) and TOR (rapamycin) on
Drosophila melanogaster lifespan and quality of life (locomotor activity and fertility).
Our data demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of PI3K, TOR, NF-κB, and iNOS
increases lifespan of Drosophila without decreasing quality of life. The greatest
lifespan expanding effect was achieved by a combination of rapamycin (5 μM) and
wortmannin (5 μM) (by 23.4%). The bioinformatic analysis (KEGG, REACTOME.PATH,
DOLite, and GO.BP) showed the greatest aging-suppressor activity of rapamycin,
consistent with experimental data.

INTRODUCTION

application of compounds in low concentrations may
reduce the risk of side effects. Another problem is that
drugs may demonstrate gender-specific efficiencies
and sex-dependent side effects [24, 25]. The aging is
a complex process that involves many intracellular
signaling pathways, we made the assumption that the
most pronounced effect on lifespan will have a combined
inhibition of aging-associated signaling pathways.
The aging process is associated with hyperactivation
of TOR and PI3K [26], as well as NF-κB [27] and iNOS
[28, 29], leading to cellular senescence, age-related
pathologies, and oncogenesis. Therefore, many anticancer
agents are inhibitors of the same enzymes as agingsuppressors, including TOR [26, 30-32], PI3K [33], NFκB [34] and iNOS [35]. This is entirely consistent with the
theory that considers cellular senescence as age-dependent
hyperactivation of pro-aging signaling pathways [26, 36].
Thus, the molecular mechanisms of aging and
carcinogenesis are interrelated. In particular, long-living
mammals, such as the naked mole rat, mole rat and the

According to Build 16 of GenAge database (http://
genomics.senescence.info/genes/), it is known more
than 1700 genes associated with longevity in model
organisms, and their number is constantly increasing
[1]. Among the most known evolutionarily conserved
longevity genes are TOR (target of rapamycin) [2-4],
PI3K (phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase) [5], NF-κB (nuclear
factor-kappaB) [6, 7] and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide
synthase) [8, 9]. Therefore, we selected the products of
these genes as targets for pharmacological inhibition.
Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of the activity TOR
[10-19], PI3K [12, 20, 21], NF-κB [22] and iNOS
[23] increases the lifespan in yeasts, worms, flies and
mammals.
However despite the significant progress the effects
of low concentrations of inhibitors of longevity genes
products, sex-specific effects, and combination effects
of different inhibitors remain unclear. We suggest that

whale, have reduced cancer incidence [37-40]. Another
long-living mammal - microbat Myotis brandtii, as
we found out, has multiple extra copies of the oncosuppressor gene FBXO31, and probably also resistant
to tumorigenesis [41]. Bioinformatic analysis of the
relationship between longevity- and cancer-associated
genes/proteins revealed remarkable trend from yeast
to humans: tumor suppressors orthologs are associated
with lifespan extension, whereas the proto-oncogenes
orthologs are associated with reduced lifespan [42]. For
example, pro-longevity function is appropriate for tumor
suppressors FOXO3a [43], PTEN [44], p53 [45], however
gerontogenes PI3K and mTOR promote oncogenesis [46,
47].
Most of the 9 age-related disorders (genomic
instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of
proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial
dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion,
and altered intercellular communication), as well as one
additional - chronic inflammation may be potentially
corrected by pharmacological interventions [48].
Phenotypic screening of compounds that increase

gerontogenes products and using of gerontogenes products
as targets for molecular modeling techniques (computeraided drug design) could be the first steps for the
development of new drugs for treating aging-associated
diseases, including various cancers [49].
The purpose of this study was to examine agingsuppressor properties of specific kinase inhibitors TOR
(rapamycin), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (wortmannin)
(PDTC and QNZ) and inducible NO synthase iNOS
(1400W) on the lifespan, locomotor activity and fertility
of Drosophila melanogaster.

RESULTS
Effects on the lifespan and life quality
In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive
study of aging-suppressor properties of 5 inhibitors and
their combinations in several nano and micro molar
concentrations. The targets of studied inhibitors are the
products of gerontogenes such as TOR, PI3K, NF-κB

and iNOS.
Exposure to rapamycin (0.005 µМ) caused a
statistically significant (p <0.01) increase in median
lifespan in males (by 14%) and females (by 12%) (Table
1, Fig. 1). Rapamycin in concentration of 0.005 µМ
increased activity in negative geotaxis test in males, and
significantly increased fertility of females (Table 1, Fig.
2 and S1).
Wortmannin in concentration of 5 µМ increased the
median lifespan of males by 5% (p <0.05), but decreased
in females by 8.2% (p <0.05). In concentration of 0.005
µМ wortmannin had no statistically significant effect on
lifespan (Table 1, Fig. S2). Treatment with wortmannin in
a concentration of 5 µМ decreased spontaneous locomotor
activity in females during the second half of life, however,
however the end of life activity in treated females was
higher than in the control. Wortmannin in concentrations
of 0.005 and 5 µМ increased the reproductive period in
females (Table 1, Fig. S3). Wortmannin in concentration
of 0.005 µМ and 5 µМ in males and 5 µМ in females
significantly increased activity in the test on negative
geotaxis (Table 1, Fig. 3 and S4).
In males treatment with PDTC in concentrations of
1.25, 12.5 and 125 µМ resulted in increasing of median
lifespan by 6-10% (p<0.01) and increasing of the age
of 90% mortality by 2 and 6 %, respectively (Table 1).

In females PDTC in concentration of 125 µМ increased
median lifespan by 12% (Table 1, Fig. S5). PDTC in
concentration of 12.5 µМ increased female fertility (Table
1, Fig. S6). PDTC in a concentration of 1.25 µМ increased
the locomotor activity of males (Table 1, Fig. S7).
However in concentrations of 12.5 and 125 µМ PDTC did
not affect the locomotor activity of males (Table 1, Fig. 4
and S8).
Application of QNZ did not affect the lifespan of
males in all studied concentrations (3, 0.3, 0.03 µМ). In
females QNZ induced decreasing of lifespan (Table 1, Fig.
S9). QNZ in concentrations of 3, 0.3, 0.03 µМ increased
female fecundity (Table 1, Fig. 5). QNZ in concentration
of 0.03 µМ increased the locomotor activity of females
(Fig. 6) and in the concentration of 3 µМ activity of the
males (Fig. 7). Treatnent with QNZ in concentration of 0.3
µМ did not affect activity of males or females (Fig. S10)
In males 1400W in concentrations of 0.03 and 3
µМ and significantly increased the median lifespan (by
3 and 7%, respectively) and the age of 90% mortality
(by 13 and 5%, respectively). In females we observed a
decrease in median lifespan (by 2-5%) and the age of 90%
mortality (by 4-5%) when exposed to 1400W at different
concentrations (Table 1, Fig. S11). In concentrations
of 0.3 and 3 0.03 µМ 1400W increased the locomotor
activity of the males (Fig. 8, S12 and S13). In females

locomotor activity increased only when exposed to 1400W
in concentration of 0.3 µМ (Fig. 8, S12 and S13). 1400W
in concentration of 0.3 µМ increased female fertility

We examined 2 types of mixtures with a high
concentration of PDTC (125 µМ) and low concentrations
of wortmannin and rapamycin (0.005 µМ) as well as

mixture with the same concentrations of wortmannin and

mortality by 23.4% in females. The median lifespan of
males increased by 2.4% (Table 1, Fig. 10).
A mixture of PDTC (125 µМ) with wortmannin
(0.005 µМ), and PDTC (125 µМ) with rapamycin (0.005
µМ) increased the median lifespan in males (by 10%) and
females (by 10 and 12%, respectively). We also observed
an increase in the age of 90% mortality in females by
11.3% and 8.1% respectively (Table 1, Fig. 11 and 12).
The study of age-related dynamics of female fertility
revealed no adverse effects of mixtures of PDTC (125
µМ) with rapamycin (5 µМ) and PDTC (125 µМ) with
wortmannin (5 µМ) (Table 1, Fig. S14). When flies were
exposed to mixtures of PDTC (125 µМ) with wortmannin
(5 µМ) and PDTC (125 µМ) with rapamycin (5 µМ) we
observed a significant increase in locomotor activity of
males and females in the test on negative geotaxis and

increasing of spontaneous activity in females (Table 1,
Fig. 13 and 14).

Bioinformatic analysis
Bioinformatic analysis of the target of rapamycin,
wortmannin, PDTC and 1400W, retrieved from the
ChEMBL database, is presented in Table. 2 and 3.
According to KEGG, rapamycin affects the activity
of largest number of targets (84) and aging-associated
signaling pathways (10) if compare with other studied
substances (Table 2). Wortmannin and PDTC activated 38
and 32 targets, 6 and 4 signaling pathways, respectively.
12 targets and 9 aging associated pathways were activated
by 1400W (Table 2). The MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling

pathways were activated by all substances. Caffeine
metabolism pathway is activated after exposure to
rapamycin, PDTC and 1400W. Signaling pathways Hippo,
Hedgehog, Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity,
and TGF-β are common to rapamycin and wortmannin,
whereas Circadian rhythm - for rapamycin and PDTC.
According to REACTOME.PATH the strongest
pharmacological activity was revealed for rapamycin,
PDTC and W1400. It should be noted the effect of
rapamycin, PDTC and 1400W on the activity of
proteasome, NF-κB and ornithine decarboxylase, as
well as on the regulation of endocytosis, cell cycle and
mitosis in humans (Table 3). Treatment of rapamycin and
wortmannin affect the glyoxylate metabolism and cellular
uptake of glucose in humans (Table 3). In Drosophila
wortmannin affect the metabolism of DNA and RNA (the
catabolism of purines and pyrimidines) (Table 3). DOLite
identified associations between wortmannin, rapamycin
and different tumor types, which characterizes them as
antitumor drugs (Table 3). GO.BP shows the effect of
rapamycin, PDTC and 1400W on cell metabolism, DNA
damage response and cell cycle control (Table 3).

can prolong the lifespan of model organisms. However,
the increase of lifespan with aging-suppressor substances
rarely exceeds 40% [50, 51], which greatly less than
effects (up to 1000% or more) caused by mutations in
the regulatory genes, which are the key switches of cell
program to maintain growth or resist to stress, such as gene
of PI3Ksubunit [52]. We proceeded on the assumption
that a more effective aging-suppressor drugs may be
substances with specificity to the products of genes that
control the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of aging,
mutations in which have the greatest effect on lifespan
and the aging rate. In this regard, we investigated the
aging-suppressive properties of specific pharmacological
inhibitors of aging associated gene products TOR, PI3K,
NF-κB and iNOS. To date, in Drosophila melanogaster
described homologs of TOR [53], PI3K [54] and NF-κB
orthologs Relish [55] and Dorsal [56]. Drosophila NO
synthase gene dNOS encodes a protein that bears a strong
resemblance to all three NOS isoforms of mammalshas
[57]. The presence of target proteins in Drosophila make
possible to use it as a model for pharmacological screening
of substances with the proposed aging-suppressor activity.
In this study, we revealed the aging-suppressive
effect of rapamycin in nanomolar concentrations (0.005
µМ), in which it significantly increases the median
lifespan of females (by 14%) and females (by 12%) and
improves quality of life in test on locomotor activity.
Previously it was shown that pharmacological inhibition
of TOR prolongs lifespan in yeast [58], fruit flies [11, 12]
and mice [16, 18]. It has been shown the aging-suppressor

activity of rapamycin in concentrations of 10, 20 and 40
nM in yeast [58]. In Drosophila the lifespan increasing
effect of rapamycin was accompanied by resistance to
oxidative stress and starvation [11], and mice observed
increase in locomotor activity aging males [18]. However,
in Drosophila the lifespan increasing effect of rapamycin
in concentrations of 50, 200 and 400 μM was accompanied
by a significant reduction in fertility [11]. This data
demonstrate that lifespan increasing effect of rapamycin
in micromolar concentrations may be due to redistribution
of resources from reproduction to longevity and stress
resistance. We found out that in nanomolar concentrations
rapamycin increase lifespan without negative effect on
fertility.

concentration of 0.005 µМ do not lead to a statistically
significant effect on lifespan. Wortmannin at a
concentration of 5 µМ increased the median lifespan of
males (by 5%), but decreaseв it in females (by 8.2%).
At the same time wortmannin in concentrations of 0.005
µМ and resulted in increased locomotor activity in males.
The wortmannin toxicity that was observed in females in
a relatively high concentration 5 µМ may be related to
its irreversible binding of the drug to essential proteins
other than PI 3-kinase (wortmannin is known to bind
irreversibly to its target [59]).
We have previously shown that wortmannin (0.5
µМ) as well as another PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (5 µМ)
increased the median and maximal lifespan in Drosophila
males and females [12, 21]. Additionally, treatment with

wortmannin (5 µМ) and LY294002 (5, 100 µМ) resulted
in an increase in survival of Drosophila male and female
after acute exposure to ionizing radiation in a dose of 30
Gy [60]. Thus, the lifespan effect of the PI3K inhibitors
is concentration dependent and is apparently determined
by involvement of this enzyme in maintaining of delicate
balance between the development/reproduction on the one
hand and stress/longevity on the other. In addition to the
concentration dependence we observed the differences of
PI3K inhibition effects in different sexes.
According to literature data, specific inhibition of
PI3K by LY294002 leads to increasing of lifespan in
rotifers [61], induces dauer formation, thermotolerance
and longevity in nematodes [20]. Caenorhabditis elegans
strains bearing homozygous nonsense mutations in the
age-1 gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of PI3K
(PI3KCS), produce extremely long-lived progeny with
nearly 10-fold extension of both median and maximum
adult lifespan relative to N2DRM, a long-lived wildtype stock into which the null mutant was outcrossed
[52]. At the same time PI3K-null worms have prolonged
developmental times, increased resistance to oxidative
and electrophilic stresses [52]. The ablation of insulinlike peptide-producing median neurosecretory cells in
Drosophila brain leads to reduced fecundity, and reduced
tolerance of heat and cold [62]. However, ablated flies
show an extension of median and maximal lifespan and
increased resistance to oxidative stress and starvation [62].
In all variants of our experiments treatment by NFκB inhibitor PDTC (1.25, 12.5 and 125 µМ) increased
the median lifespan of males (by 6-10%). PDTC in
concentrations of 1.25 and 12.5 µМ decreased median
lifespan of females by 2%, but in 125 µМ increased by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

12%. Treatment with QNZ (0.03, 0.3, 3 µM) did not
affect the lifespan of males. In females, treatment with
0.03, 0.3 and 3 µM of QNZ reduced median lifespan by
4-15%. The differences in the effects of PDTC and QNZ
may be associated with different molecular mechanisms
of action of these compounds. While PDTC inhibits NFκB activation by preventing degradation I-κB [63, 64],
QNZ inhibits the NF-κB at the transcriptional activity
level [65]. Furthermore, PDTC has antioxidant and metal
chelating properties [63, 64], which may enhance its
aging-suppressive action.
Recent studies suggest that the NF-κB transcription
factor controls age-dependent changes in inflammation
genes expression. For example the increase of NF-κB
dependent genes expression in human blood vessel
endothelium with age is primarily linked to decreased
IκB-mediated NF-κB inhibition [66]. With age expression
of NF-κB dependent genes contributing to progression of
atherosclerosis in rat glomeruli increases [67]. However,
selective inhibition of NF-κB activity in blood vessel
endothelial cells prevents atherosclerosis progression [68].
Genetic blockade of NF-κB in the skin of chronologically
aged mice reverses the global gene expression program
and tissue characteristics to those of young mice [69,
70]. Chronic NF-κB mediated immune system activation
enhanced pathogen resistance, however significantly
reduced lifespan [71]. Extensive evidence has now
emerged indicating a critical role for NF-κB in promoting
oncogenic conversion and in facilitating later stage tumor
properties such as metastasis [34]. Pharmacological
inhibitors of NF-κB pathways often, but not always,
suppress cancer growth [34]. Decrease of NF-κB activity
level impedes progression of degenerative phenotype in
1518

mice with knocked out Sirt6 sirtuin gene that is involved
in the base excision repair [72]. It is suggested that the
most important homeostatic function of SIRT6 is in the
prevention of NF-κB dependent gene overactivation via
deacetylation of lysine 9 of the H3 histone (H3K9) on the
promoters of NF-κB target genes, whereas overactivation
of NF-κB promotes normal and accelerated aging [72].
Pharmacological inhibition of IκB kinase (IKK) leads to
a delay of the development of age-related pathologies in
mice with progeria, reduces the level of oxidative DNA
damage and prevents stress-induced cellular senescence
[73]. Recently it was revealed that IKK-β and NF-κB
inhibit gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to
mediate ageing-related hypothalamic GnRH decline [27].
After age-dependent inhibition of IKK-β activation and
NF-κB in the hypothalamus or in the brain of mice delay
the aging process and increase the lifespan (by 20%) [27].
Thus IKK-β and NF-κB mediate the programmatic role
of hypothalamus in ageing development via immuneneuroendocrine integration [27]. Overactivation of innate
immune-response pathways in the brain is responsible for
neurodegeneration [74]. In Drosophila neurodegeneration
is dependent on the NF-κB transcription factor, Relish
[74]. In our earlier studies it has been shown the lifespan
increasing in Drosophila when exposed to PDTC in a
concentration of 125 µМ [22].
The observed increase in lifespan in males and its
decrease in females inhibiting iNOS with (0.03, 0.3, 3
µМ) may be due to the ambiguous role of this enzyme in
aging and longevity. For example, iNOS gene knockout
mice have reduced lifespan, but the increased activity of
this gene leads to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases
[75]. Pharmacological inhibition of iNOS leads to reduced
risk of cardiovascular disease in rats [76]. Consequently,
as overactivation well as complete suppression of iNOS
lead to negative effects. Since females consume more
food than males, they get more substance during lifetime
[77]. This can lead to excessive inactivation of dNOS and
negative effects on lifespan and locomotor activity. The
lifespan decreasing in females may be caused by an upregulation of reproduction. Thus, it can be assumed that
the lifespan effect of 1400W in different concentration
was gender specific and associated with the amount of
consumed substance and rate of reproduction.
Nitrosative stress is now considered as an important
cause of physiological decline that characterizes the
aging of many tissues [29, 78]. Age related changes in
nitric oxide synthase activity and/or expression and the
consequent changes in NO production and biological
activity, apparently contribute to this reduction [29, 78].
Several recent studies suggest that NO and iNOS could
be involved in aging-induced insulin resistance [79] as
well as in cardiovascular, pulmonary, musculoskeletal
neurological dysfunction, and cancer [78, 80]. It has
been shown that iNOS activation can inhibit DNA
repair pathways including direct DNA repair, base and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

nucleotide excision repair [80]. As it is well known DNA
repair pathways play the crucial role in aging process
and development of age-related pathologies [81]. Thus,
genetic, pharmacological, and physiological iNOS
inhibition may contribute to the combat against agerelated diseases and lifespan increasing.
Since the aging is a complex process that involves
many intracellular signaling pathways, we made the
assumption that the most pronounced effect on longevity
may be achieved by simultaneous inhibition of several
aging-associated signaling pathways. According to our
data, the combined effects on longevity of rapamycin
(5 µМ) and wortmannin (5 µМ) and the combination
of PDTC (125 µМ) with rapamycin (0.005 µМ) and
wortmannin (0.005 µМ) is female-biased. In males, the
combined application of substances increase lifespan no
greater than each of the inhibitors tested separately. The
gender difference of the observed effects may be due to
the initially existing sex differences in drug metabolisms
[25], stress resistanse [82] reproductive strategies [83].
It is shown that combined treatment of nematodes by
curcumin and thioflavin T did not demonstrate additive
effect on the lifespan [84].

Bioinformatic analysis
Analysis of targets that are affected by drugs
according KEGG shows, that compounds affect MAPK
and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (all compounds),
Caffeine metabolism (rapamycin, PDTC and 1400W)
and Circadian rhythm pathways (rapamycin and PDTC)
that are involved in lifespan control [5, 85, 86] and
cancer development [87-89]. Rapamycin and wortmannin
affected Hippo and Hedgehog that are tumor suppression
and longevity associated pathways [90, 91].
REACTOME.PATH analysis showed that
rapamycin, PDTC and 1400W influence such agingrelated processes such as activation of NF-κB, regulation
of endocytosis, cell cycle and mitosis. Furthermore
rapamycin, PDTC and 1400W affect regulation of
ornithine decarboxylase, associated with aging and
Alzheimer’s disease [92], lymphoma [93] and breast
cancer [94]. Rapamycin and wortmannin affect the
regulation of the cellular uptake of glucose and glyoxylate
metabolism. Expression of the main glyoxylate enzyme is
up-regulated in daf-2 and age-1 long-lived Caenorhabditis
elegans mutants [95, 96]. Wortmannin affects the
catabolism of purines and pyrimidines involved in the
processes of aging through DNA and RNA metabolism,
maintaining energy balance [97].
Analysis of gene-associated diseases by DOLite also
reveals an association of rapamycin and wortmannin with
genes involved in the molecular mechanisms of different
types of cancer. Wortmannin is associated with skin tumor,
while rapamycin with skin tumor, histiocytosis, infiltrating
cancer, sarcoma. These data confirm the anti-cancer
1519

properties of these aging-suppressor drugs and a close
relationship between aging and carcinogenesis.
According to GO.BP analysis rapamycin activates
the DNA damage response that triggers p53-dependent
cell cycle arrest. While arresting cell cycle, p53 may
simultaneously suppress the senescence program,
thus causing quiescence. p53 suppresses senescence
presumably by inhibition of mTOR [98, 99]. Senescence
occurs when p53 fails to inhibit mTOR. In addition it
was shown that rapamycin extended the mean lifespan of
p53+/‐ mice and decreased the incidence of spontaneous
tumors [17]. Thus, rapamycin may compensate decreasing
of р53 function, that prevents senescence, extends lifespan
and decreases the rate of tumors via TOR-dependent
mechanism. Recently, we found that overexpression of
the GADD45 gene leads to an increase in longevity and
stress resistance of Drosophila [100, 101]. GADD45A in
mammals is a p53-activated gene [102]. In this context the
p53-dependent activation of GADD45 may complete the
anti-aging and stress resistance effects of p53.
The bioinformatic analysis of data obtained from
KEGG, REACTOME.PATH, DOLite and GO.BP revealed
the highest activity of rapamycincin in comparison with
wortmannin, PDTC and 1400W.
The promising strategy to slow down ageing and
prevent or delay the onset of age-related diseases is that
of mild stress-induced hormesis by using hormetins
[103]. Previously we observed lifespan expanding effect
of radiation hormesis [104], that may be mediated by
FOXO, SIRT1, JNK, ATM, ATR, and p53 genes [105] as
well as heat shock proteins and heat shock factor [106].
The results of bioinformatics analyses demonstrate that
rapamycin, wortmannin, PDTC, QNZ and 1400W induce
aging suppressive effects as hormetins that inhibit the
aging-associated pathways [107]. Obviously that studied
drugs inhibit the hyperactivity of pro-aging signaling.
Thus our data fully agree with hyperfunction theory of
Mikhail Blagosklonny [26, 36].
Thus, we conducted a comprehensive study of
rapamycin, wortmannin, PDTC, QNZ and 1400W effects
in different concentrations and combinations on the life
span and quality of Drosophila. Our data demonstrates
that inhibiton of PI3K, TOR, NF-κB and iNOS may
increase life span without decreasing of the life quality
(fertility and locomotor activity). The low concentrations
of inhibitors are less likely induce negative effects on
the quality of life. Also, we found significant differences
in the effects of inhibitors treatment between males and
females. In females, we observed a more negative effects
on longevity without reducing the locomotor activity or
fertility. In all experimental variants treatment of males
increased life span and locomotor activity was not lower
than in the control group. It has been found that the
combined effect of drugs has the largest positive effect on
the life span of females. The differences observed between
males and females may be due to the functional features
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the sexes at the level of the genome, transcriptome and
metabolome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drosophila strains
We used wild-type Canton-S flies for the
experimental procedures (provided by the Bloomington
Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University,
Bloomington, Indiana, USA).

Treatment with inhibitors
We greased fly medium by paste of hydrolyzed
yeast containing one of the substances. Control untreated
animals were fed by yeast past without substances. To
make the hydrolyzat yeast were boiled in water bath for 30
minutes. To prepare the 100 ml of paste 50 g of dry yeast
per 60 mL of water were used.
The following compounds were fed to imago flies
through yeast paste in a throughout the lifetime:
- rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (Rapa) – TOR
inhibitor [108], 0.005 µМ;
- wortmannin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (Wm) – PI3K
inhibitor [109], 0.005 and 5 µМ;
- pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA)
(PDTC) – NF-κB inhibitor [63, 64], 125 µМ; 12.5 µМ;
1.25 µМ;
-N4-[2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethyl]-4,6quinazolinediamine (Merck KGaA, Germany) (QNZ) –
ингибитор NF-κB inhibitor [65], 3 µМ, 0.3 µМ, 0.03 µМ;
- N-(3-(Aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (Merck
KGaA, Germany) (1400W) – iNOS inhibitor [110], 3 µМ,
0.3 µМ, 0.03 µМ;
- mix 5 µМ Rapa + 5 µМ Wm;
- mix 125µМ PDTC + 0.005 µМ Rapa;
- mix 125µМ PDTC + 0.005 µМ Wm.

Lifespan analysis
Control and experimental flies were maintained
at 25±0.5°C in a 12 h-12 h light/dark cycle on a sugaryeast medium covered with the yeast paste. To estimate
the longevity 250-450 flies were collected during 24 h
since the onset of eclosion (about 30 adult flies per 120 ml
vial) for each experimental variant. Males and non-virgin
females were kept separately. Flies were transferred to a
fresh medium two times a week. Dead flies were counted
daily. For each experimental variant 2 biological replicates
were pooled.
Survival functions were estimated using the
Kaplan–Meier procedure and plotted as survival curves
1520

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 1507-1526

[111]. Median lifespan and the age of 90% mortality
were calculated. The statistical analysis of survival
data was conducted using nonparametric methods.
Comparison of survival functions was done using the
modified Kolmogorov–Smirnov test [112]. The statistical
significance of differences between the mean life spans
for the experimental and control variants was determined
using the Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon [113] and Mantel–
Cox tests [114]. To test the statistical significance of
differences in maximum lifespan (age of 90% mortality),
the Wang–Allison test was used [115]. The Kaplan-Meier
curves were plotted using STATISTICA, version 6.1
(StatSoft Inc, USA). Calculation of lifespan parameters
and their statistical analysis were performed in the R
software environment for statistical computing and
graphics (http://www.r-project.org/).

KEGG - is a method of molecular pathways annotations
where particular gene is involved in, that provided by
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (www.
genome.jp/kegg) [118]. Also the information from
REACTOME.PATH, DOLite и GO.BP databases were
used. The basic unit of the REACTOME.PATH database
is reaction. The reactions are grouped in the causal chain
in the form of a path (http://www.reactome.org) [119].
DOLite - is a database of gene-disease associations,
which allows to track the relationship between genes and
pathologies (http://fundo.nubic.northwestern.edu/) [120].
GO - is a project to unify the representation of gene and
gene product attributes across all species (http://www.
geneontology.org/) [121]. The objectives of the GO project
are to compile annotations to the genes and products,
maintaining and updating a clearly defined list of gene
attributes and their products in the domains «biological
process», «molecular function», «cellular component».
Obtaining of gene ontologies for lists of considered genes
was performed in the R package BioMart [122, 123].
Analysis and comparison of the investigated substances
were performed in the R package GeneAnswers for
annotation of the molecular mechanisms proposed by
REACTOME.PATH, DOLite and GO.BP [124].

Fertility assay
Fertility by number of laid eggs and number of
pupae was estimated. The flies were kept under the
same conditions (10 females and 10 males per vial) and
transferred to a fresh medium twice a week. Daily egg
production by females was calculated once a week. After
10 days, formed pupae were counted. The significance of
differences between fertility of control and treated flies at
different ages was evaluated using the χ2-test.

NF-κB and COX) on the maximum lifespan”, the RFBR
grant N 11-04-00956 and CrowdAge initiative.

Locomotor activity assay
To estimate the locomotor activity parameters, 90
flies were collected (30 flies per vial) for each experiment.
Flies were kept under identical conditions and transferred
to a fresh medium twice a week. Males and females were
studied separately. Measurements of locomotor activity
were carried out using the Drosophila Population Monitor
(TriKinetics Inc, USA). For the evaluation of spontaneous
activity the total activity of the 30 flies for 3 minutes was
taken into account. To test negative geotaksis flies were
flicked on the bottom of the vial and the movement was
measured during 20 seconds. The arithmetic mean of three
replicates was considered. The significance of differences
between locomotor activity (a total number of infrared
beam crossings) in sample groups at different ages was
evaluated using the χ2-test [116].
