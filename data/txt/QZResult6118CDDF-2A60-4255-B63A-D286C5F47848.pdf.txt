worldwide. Five-year survival rates for localized, regional, and
distant disease are 90%, 60%, and 9%, respectively (1, 2). RCC is
refractory to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Encouragingly, two
targeted therapeutics, sunitinib (Sutent) and sorafenib (Nexavar),
which target multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and Raf kinases,
have shown better response than other agents in clinical trials
and have recently been approved to treat advanced human RCC
(3–5).
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases (MKK) are
crucial enzymes at the intersection of several biological pathways
that regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival (6, 7).
In response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, MKKs become
activated and then phosphorylate MAPKs, including extracellular
signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun-NH2 kinase (JNK),
and p38 MAPK (p38). Mutations of proteins in this pathway have
been found to contribute to f20% of all human cancers (8, 9).
MKK/ERK signaling has been shown to play a crucial role in
tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis (10–12). Activated ERK or
elevated ERK expression has been detected in a variety of human
tumors, including breast carcinoma, glioblastoma, and primary
tumor cells derived from kidney, colon, and lung tissues (13–16).
Sustained activation of ERK has been established as a requirement
for angiogenesis (17–21). Overexpression of MKK was also found in
human RCC cases (52%; ref. 22).
In this study, we first found significantly high expression of
MKK1 and ERK2 in human clear cell RCC relative to normal
controls. We therefore hypothesize that targeting this pathway may
be of therapeutic value against ccRCC. To test this hypothesis, we
used anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) as an inhibitor to block multiple
MAPK signaling pathways. LeTx is an exotoxin produced by the
Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis and comprises two
proteins: protective antigen and lethal factor. Protective antigen, by
itself, is not toxic; it serves to translocate lethal factor to the cytosol.
Lethal factor is a Zn2+-metalloprotease, which specifically cleaves
the NH2-termini of MKK1, MKK2, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, and MKK7,
but not MKK5 (23–25). Cleavage results in loss of kinase function of
MKKs (26). It has been shown that LeTx reverts the transformation
of V12 H-ras–transformed NIH 3T3 cells in vitro and inhibits their
growth and vascularization in vivo (27). Inhibition of MAPK
signaling with either LeTx or a small-molecule MKK inhibitor
triggers apoptosis in human melanoma cells (28, 29). LeTx also
causes tumor regression in human melanoma xenograft models
(28, 30).
In summary, in this paper, we show that there is an overexpression of MKK and MAPK in clear cell RCC, and inhibition of
MKK signaling by LeTx suppresses RCC growth, as well as disrupts
tumor vascularization in vivo.

Abstract
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways play essential roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. Recent studies also show the activation of MAPK
signaling pathways in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and angiogenesis of multiple human malignancies, including renal cell
carcinoma (RCC). To assess the role of this pathway in
regulating the proliferation and survival of RCC cells, we first
examined the expression of MAPK kinase (MKK) and MAPK in
clear cell RCC and confirmed the overexpression of MKK1 and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) in these tumors.
We then tested the effects of pharmacologic inhibition of MKK
on human RCC cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo, using
anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx), which cleaves and inactivates
several MKKs. Western blotting showed that the phosphorylation levels of ERK, c-Jun-NH2 kinase, and p38 MAPK
decreased after 72 h of LeTx treatment. Exposure to LeTx for
72 h reduced cell proliferation by 20% without significant
effects on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Anchorageindependent growth of RCC cells was dramatically inhibited
by LeTx. In vivo studies showed that tumor growth of RCC
xenografts could be suppressed by LeTx. Extensive necrosis
and decreased tumor neovascularization were observed after
LeTx treatment. LeTx also showed direct inhibition of
proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro. Our results suggest
that suppression of one or more MAPK signaling pathways
may inhibit RCC growth through the disruption of tumor
vasculature. [Cancer Res 2008;68(1):81–8]

Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) arises in the renal cortex and
comprises 80% to 85% of all kidney cancers. Although it only
accounts for f2% of all cancers, the incidence of kidney
malignancies has increased over the past three decades. Annually,
there are over 36,000 newly diagnosed cases in the United States
and nearly 210,000 new cases worldwide. Mortality is f12,600
deaths each year in the United States and 102,000 deaths

Biosciences).
Tumor implantation and growth in RCC xenograft model. All animal
studies were in compliance with VARI Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee policies. Six-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu nude mice (Charles
River) were given s.c. injections of 2  106 ACHN or A-498 cells in the right

(Mitutoyo) that have an accuracy of F0.02 mm, and tumor volume was
calculated as length  width  height  0.5. Tumor growth ratio is

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Protective antigen, lethal factor, and E687C (an inactive form
of lethal factor) were purified from cultures of B. anthracis, as described
(31). U0126 was purchased from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences) and
prepared as 10 mmol/L stock solution in DMSO.
Expression of MKK and MAPK in clear cell RCC. The mRNA
expression of MKK-related and MAPK-related genes was measured in 174
clear cell renal tumors and 15 normal kidney samples using Affymetrix
HGU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays, as described elsewhere (32).
Cells and cell culture. ACHN, A-498, 786-O, 769-P, SW156, Caki-1, and
Caki-2 RCC cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. UO-31, TK-10, SN12C, and RXF393 cells were kindly provided by
Dr. George Vande Woude (Van Andel Research Institute); SKRC39 cells were
obtained from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The cells were
maintained in DMEM or RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at
37jC. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC) were obtained
from Clonetics and maintained in Clonetics EBM-2 medium supplemented
with EGM-2 singlequots (Cambrex).
Cell proliferation assay
(a) Cell growth. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (8,000 cells per mL)
24 h before initiation of treatment with LeTx (1 Ag/mL protective antigen
plus 0.5 Ag/mL lethal factor) or U0126 (10 Amol/L from 10 mmol/L stock
solution in DMSO) for 8 days. E687C (0.5 Ag/mL) plus protective antigen
(1 Ag/mL), 0.1% DMSO, and untreated cells served as controls. Medium
containing inhibitors was replaced every 3 days during each experiment.
Each day, one plate of cells was trypsinized and the number of cells was
counted. Each treatment was performed in duplicate, and each experiment
was repeated thrice.
(b) Cell viability. Cell viability was determined with a colorimetric 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS; Promega) assay. Briefly, 3,000 exponentially growing cells
were seeded per well in 96-well plates and treated with 10 Ag/mL protective
antigen alone, or 10 Ag/mL protective antigen plus 0 to 50 Ag/mL lethal
factor, or DMSO or U0126 (0–50 Amol/L) for 48 or 72 h. Twenty microliters
of MTS reagent plus 100 AL of fresh culture medium were added to each
well. After a 2-h incubation period, optical absorbance at 490 nm and a
reference wavelength at 690 nm were measured. Results were expressed as
percentage of viable cells relative to cells treated with protective antigen
alone. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least
thrice.
Soft agar colony formation assay. RCC cells were cultured in a twolayer agar system to prevent their attachment to the plastic surface. Cells
(4  104) were trypsinized to single-cell suspensions, resuspended in 0.4%
agar (Sigma), and added to a preset 1% bottom agar layer in six-well plates.
The top agar cell layers were covered with culture medium containing 10%
FBS and either LeTx (1 Ag/mL protective antigen plus 0.5 Ag/mL lethal
factor), E687C (1 Ag/mL protective antigen plus 0.5 Ag/mL E687C), U0126
(10 Amol/L), or 0.1% DMSO or were left untreated. The top medium
containing inhibitors was changed twice per week. Cells were incubated in
5% CO2 at 37jC for 14 days, and colonies were stained with 0.005% crystal
violet in methanol. The colonies with a diameter exceeding 100 Am were
counted on micrographs using ImageJ v1.37v software. Experiments were
performed in triplicate and repeated thrice.
Western blot analysis. Cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes as
described above and harvested after 72 h of treatment. Protein was
extracted from cell pellets with a lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate in the
presence of protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche Diagnostics]. Samples
containing equal amounts of protein (30 Ag) were separated by
electrophoresis on 10% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with TTBS (TBS +
0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk, the membranes were
incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated

Figure 2. The effect of LeTx on proliferation of RCC cells. Viability of ACHN cells and A-498 cells after treatment with (A) LeTx [10 Ag/mL protective antigen (PA) plus
0–50 Ag/mL lethal factor (LF )] or (B) U0126 (0-50 Amol/L) was determined by MTS assay. Cells were treated for 48 or 72 h at the indicated concentration of LeTx
or U0126. C, growth curve of ACHN and A-498 cells treated with LeTx (1 Ag/mL protective antigen plus 0.5 Ag/mL lethal factor) or U0126 (10 Amol/L).

presented as mean F SD and normalized to the initial volume when
treatment began. When tumors had grown to an average volume of
100 or 300 mm3 for ACHN or A-498 xenografts, respectively, tumorbearing mice were separated into three groups of 10 animals. For ACHN
tumors, all groups received i.p. injections of LeTx every other day with
2.5 standard doses for one group and two standard doses for the other
(1 standard dose = 10 Ag protective antigen plus 2 Ag lethal factor) for a
total of eight injections per group; the third group received the HBSS
only (vehicle control group). For A-498 tumors, two groups received i.v.
injections of LeTx thrice per week with two and one standard dose for
each group for a total of five injections per group and the third group
received HBSS as a control. Mice were euthanized at the end of the
treatment period. Plasma samples were collected and stored at 80jC
for further studies. Tumors were removed, cleaned from adjacent tissues,
fixed in 4% polyformadehyde, and paraffin-embedded, and then
4-Am-thick sections were prepared. Some sections were stained with
H&E, and the others were used for subsequent immunohistochemical
analysis.
Immunohistochemistry. Sections from the formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tumor tissues were cut to 4 Am and deparaffinized in xylene,
followed by treatment with a graded series of ethanol solutions and
rehydration in PBS. Immunohistochemistry staining for p-ERK (Venetana),

p-JNK (Cell Signaling), and p-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling) were performed
using optimized standard protocols on a Ventana Discovery XT staining
system (Ventana). Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated UltraMap antimouse IgG or UltraMap anti-rabbit IgG (Ventana) were used with DAB to
develop color. The proliferative index of tumor sections was determined
by staining with a rabbit polyclonal proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) antibody (Abcam). To measure the effect of LeTx treatment on
microvascular density, tumor sections were stained for endothelial cells
using a rat monoclonal anti-mouse CD34 antibody (MEC 14.7, Abcam).
Briefly, the slides were deparrafinized and rehydrated as described above.
For CD34 staining, the slides were incubated with citrate buffer (pH 6.0;
Zymed) at 95jC for 30 min to expose the antigen. Next, sections were
immersed in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase
activity and then incubated in 5% goat or rabbit serum. The sections were
then incubated with PCNA or CD34 antibodies overnight at 4jC in primary
antibody diluting buffer (Biomeda). After washing with TTBS, sections were
incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector). After washing
with TTBS, sections were incubated with Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector).
The immune complex was visualized using DAB substrate solution (Vector).
To determine the apoptotic index, TUNEL staining was also performed on
tumor sections according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Roche
Diagnostics).

For PCNA and TUNEL staining, pictures of five fields (0.09 mm2 each) per
slide were taken using a Nuance multispectral imaging system (CRi) at
400 magnification and multispectral acquisition software. The images
were processed by Nuance image processing software 1.6.8 to measure the
spectral absorbance curve of each of the stains and then were unmixed. The
percentage of positive staining (DAB) was then quantified using
Imagine_0.16 software (developed by our laboratory) and expressed as the
percentage of positive pixels to total pixels of the analyzed area. For CD34
staining, pictures of five fields per slide were taken at 200 magnification.
Microvessel density was determined in a blinded manner by counting using
Imagine_0.16, for each tumor, the total number of vessels in five fields
(0.36 mm2 each) showing the highest vascular density (33). For other
antibodies, the whole section was reviewed and scored semiquantitatively
using a visual grading system based on the intensity of staining ( , negative;
+, weak; ++, modest; +++, strong), and the percentage of staining
(0, 1–25%, 26–50%, 51–75%, >75%) according to the intensity of chromogen

checked the expression levels of MKKs and MAPKs in 174
human clear cell RCC samples by Affymetrix microarray analysis. We found that MKK1 and ERK2 were significantly elevated
in human ccRCC samples compared with normal controls
(P < 0.001; Fig. 1A and B). We also examined the basal activation
of MAPKs in RCC cell lines by Western blotting. Constitutive
activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK were observed in RCC cell
lines (Fig. 1C).
LeTx showed modest effect on proliferation of RCC cells
in vitro. Because signaling through MKK is thought to play an
essential role in the proliferation of cancer cells, we evaluated the
effect of inhibition of MKK, using either LeTx or U0126 (a specific
MKK1/2 inhibitor), on the proliferation of RCC cells in vitro.
Previous studies about how lethal factor enters the cell and inhibits
MKKs have shown that protective antigen forms heptamer while
binding to lethal factor, so the ideal working molecule ratio of
protective antigen and lethal factor is 5:1 to 7:1. Therefore, we used
10 Ag/mL protective antigen (enough for most lethal factor doses)
plus 0 to 50 Ag/mL lethal factor in proliferation assay (MTS).
Proliferation of ACHN cells was inhibited by 20% to 30% by LeTx
relative to controls, but little effect was observed on A-498 cells
after 72 h of LeTx treatment (Fig. 2A). The effect of LeTx on other

stimulating effect of multiple growth factors existing in complete
medium, we also checked the effect of LeTx on activation of
MAPKs under serum-starved condition. Similar results were found
(Supplementary Fig. S2). LeTx could also inhibit the constitutively
activated MAPKs.
LeTx inhibited anchorage-independent growth of RCC cells.
Anchorage-independent growth is a characteristic of transformed
cells. Intrinsic anchorage-independent growth activity in vitro
closely reflects the tumorigenicity of epithelial cells. Loss of
anchorage dependence leads to reversible growth arrest of
fibroblasts and apoptosis of epithelial and endothelial cells
(35, 36). After 14 days of exposure, LeTx inhibited the anchorageindependent colony formation of ACHN and A-498 cells by 90%
at 0.5 Ag/mL (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with U0126
(10 Amol/L).
LeTx inhibited RCC tumor growth and neovascularization
in vivo. RCC xenografts are slowly growing tumors. We tested
the effect of LeTx on established tumors after s.c. inoculation of
the cancer cells in the right flank of nude mice. Treatment
began when the average tumor volume reached 100 or 300 mm3
for ACHN or A-498 xenografts, respectively. I.p. injection of LeTx
was performed in the ACHN xenograft model. The tumor growth
was inhibited by 90% using 2 and 2.5 standard doses of LeTx
(referred as 2 and 2.5 LeTx in Supplementary Fig. S3). For
A-498 xenograft model, i.v. injection was performed. The tumor
growth was inhibited by one standard dose of LeTx (referred as
1 LeTx), and tumor regression was observed with two standard
doses of LeTx (referred as 2 LeTx in Fig. 5) treatment. The
in vivo dose was based on the result of previous studies that
have shown using 10 Ag protective antigen plus 2 Ag lethal
factor per mouse, effective but not lethal, as the standard dose

tested; the proliferation of only 4 of 10 other RCC cell lines could be
inhibited by 20% to 30% after 72 h of LeTx exposure (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Exposure to U0126 gave similar results (Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S1B). The growth curves of ACHN and A-498
cells treated with LeTx or U0126 were shown in Fig. 2C. LeTx and
U0126 showed robust inhibition on the proliferation of ACHN and
A-498 cells after a longer period of treatment (8 days) relative to
E687C and DMSO controls. We also got similar result with MTS
assay after the cells were treated with LeTx for 7 days
(Supplementary Fig. S1C).
LeTx inhibited phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38
MAPKs in RCC cells in vitro. We then tested whether the
inhibitory effect on cell proliferation by LeTx was associated with
the reduced phosphorylation levels of MAPKs in RCC cells. The
major function of MKKs is to phosphorylate and activate
downstream MAPKs, and cleavage of MKKs by LeTx will result
in loss of this function. Measuring the phosphorylation levels of
MAPKs could therefore reflect the inhibition of MKKs. There are
three major MAPKs: ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK (p38). We used
0.5 Ag/mL lethal factor plus 1 Ag/mL protective antigen and
10 Amol/L U0126, which was shown as the most effective dose in
proliferation assay (see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1) to treat
the cells. Moreover, 10 Amol/L U0126 has also been shown to be
sufficient to inhibit ERK phosphorylation in melanoma cells (28).
After treatment with LeTx for 72 h, phosphorylation of ERK,
JNK, and p38 kinases in ACHN and A-498 cells was inhibited,
relative to E687C and untreated controls (Fig. 3A and B). U0126
showed similar result on phosphorylated ERK. The cleavage of
MKK1, MKK3, and MKK6 was also confirmed by Western blotting
using an NH2 terminal–specific antibody. All MKKs were
effectively cleaved by LeTx treatment (Fig. 3C). To rule out the

We used PCNA staining as a marker for proliferating cells in
tumor sections. For the A-498 xenografts, the number of PCNApositive cells (as shown by proliferation index) decreased slightly
after LeTx treatment when compared with the controls (Fig. 5C).
Extensive DNA fragmentation may occur in late stages of necrosis
(37, 38), which would also be positive in TUNEL staining. The
large necrotic area after LeTx treatment was also positively
stained by the TUNEL method. Therefore, we only count TUNELpositive cells in the viable tumor section (rim) to calculate the
percentage of apoptosis induced by LeTx in vivo. In both ACHN
and A-498 xenografts, no increase of apoptotic cells (as shown by
apoptosis index) was found after LeTx treatment (Fig. 5C and
Supplementary Fig. S3C). But an increased area of necrotic cells
(also TUNEL positive) was observed in the tumor sections treated
by LeTx.

for in vivo experiment (27, 28). Another study done by Abi-Habib
et al. also showed that 5:1 ratio of protective antigen to lethal factor
produced significant tumor growth inhibition on melanoma (30).
An increased necrotic area was observed in LeTx-treated sections
compared with vehicle controls after H&E staining (note the
decreased viable rim in Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S3B).
To confirm that the growth inhibition effect was correlated with
MKK signaling inhibition, we performed phosphorylated MAPK
staining in the tumor sections. Modest or strong staining of
phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated JNK, and phosphorylated p38
were found in viable tumor sections of HBSS-treated controls,
whereas only weak or modest staining of the above antigens
were found in viable tumor sections of LeTx-treated tumors,
especially in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S3B).

are also activated by MKK3 (43, 44). We reconfirmed the cleavage of
MKK3 and MKK6 kinases using their NH2-terminal antibodies and
found that both MKKs were cleaved by LeTx treatment. Decreased
phosphorylation of some isoforms of p38 kinase may be due to the
inhibition of certain phosphorylation sites.
The proliferation of RCC cells was only inhibited modestly after
treatment with LeTx for 72 h in vitro, but if the cells were treated
for a longer duration (see Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S1C);
robust inhibition of proliferation was observed relative to controls.
The doubling time of RCC cells in vitro is f48 h. LeTx may only
slow down cell cycle progression rather than killing the cells, so it
took several cell cycles to reflect this effect, i.e., decrease in cell
number. No significant effect on cell cycle distribution and
apoptosis was observed from LeTx treatment both for 72 h and
7 days (Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). U0126 showed similar
results as LeTx, but was less effective, which shows that inhibition
of multiple MKK signaling is of more value to RCC cell proliferation
than a single MKK/ERK pathway.
In vivo, we observed similar result. Proliferation of A-498 cells,
but not ACHN cells (as shown by PCNA staining), was partially
inhibited by LeTx treatment without induction of apoptosis
(as shown by TUNEL staining). The activation of MAPKs was also
inhibited, especially in the cytoplasmic compartment, leaving a
smaller portion of activated MAPKs in the nucleus after LeTx
treatment. Despite the weak antiproliferation effect of LeTx on
RCC cells, profound tumor growth inhibition was observed after
LeTx treatment in RCC xenograft models. Extensive necrosis was
also observed in the center of tumors after four to five treatments
with LeTx. Because we observed weak or modest effects of LeTx on
tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis, the antitumor effect in vivo
is most likely caused by the antiangiogenic effect. The extensive
tumor necrosis may be a result of the interruption of tumor
vasculature.
Previous studies have shown that activation of MKK signal
transduction pathways in endothelial cells is required for
angiogenesis. MKK activity regulates vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (45). The role of ERK activation in angiogenic
growth factor signaling has been well established (46). ERK
activation is probably required for the growth factor–induced
secretion of angiogenic factors from tumor cells (47). Here, we
examined the direct effect of inhibition of MAPKs signaling with
LeTx on endothelial cell proliferation. LeTx showed robust
inhibition of endothelial cells, which is consistent with the findings
of others (29, 39, 48).
Frequent VHL mutation, which leads to the overexpression of
VEGF through HIF signaling, was found in the majority of clear cell
RCC patients and may contribute to angiogenesis in tumors.
Because growth factors often act through autocrine and/or
paracrine routes, we also investigated the production of VEGF by
RCC cells and/or host cells both in vitro and in vivo. But the
secretion of VEGF by A-498 and ACHN cells both in vitro and
in vivo was not inhibited by LeTx treatment, whereas the
production of VEGF by mouse stromal cells in vivo was slightly
inhibited by LeTx treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6). The fact that
LeTx failed to inhibit the secretion of VEGF by RCC cells suggests
that LeTx may act directly on endothelial cells in vivo. These data
indicate that the antitumor efficacy of LeTx may be primarily
attributable to angiogenesis inhibition resulting from the inhibition
of MKK signaling in endothelial cells. More studies are needed to
validate this hypothesis.

Figure 6. Effect of LeTx and U0126 on proliferation of HUVEC cells. Viability
of HUVEC cells after treatment with LeTx (10 Ag/mL protective antigen plus
0–50 Ag/mL lethal factor) or U0126 (0–50 Amol/L) was determined by MTS
assay. Cells were treated for 48 or 72 h at the indicated concentration of LeTx
or U0126.

We observed the extensively necrotic areas in LeTx-treated
tumor sections. Because LeTx only modestly inhibited tumor cells
proliferation but did not induce apoptosis, we speculate that the
antitumor effect may be mainly caused by inhibition of tumor
angiogenesis. Therefore, we used CD34, a vascular endothelial cell
biomarker, to stain the tumor sections and counted the microvessel density. The microvessel density was significantly decreased after LeTx treatment when compared with HBSS-treated
controls (P < 0.001; Fig. 5C). We also examined the direct effect of
LeTx on endothelial cell proliferation in vitro; LeTx showed more
profound inhibition on endothelial cell proliferation than U0126
(Fig. 6).

Discussion
The role of RAS/RAF/MKK/ERK signaling in tumorigenesis and
metastasis has been well established. Further studies have
suggested that other MKK pathways may also play a role in
angiogenesis (39–42). MKK inhibition is an attractive anticancer
strategy, as it has the potential to block inappropriate signal
transduction regardless of the upstream position of the oncogenic
aberration. As a multiple MKK inhibitor, LeTx is different from
most small-molecule MKK inhibitors, which only block MKK1/
MKK2 activity. LeTx acts through the cell surface receptor, cleaving
and inactivating multiple MKKs.
Our cellular study showed that LeTx could inhibit phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs in RCC cells under both normal
and serum-starved conditions, but we also observed an extra band
of phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Fig. 3A and B), which might be
differentially phosphorylated isoforms of p38 MAPK. Four isoforms
of p38 kinase (a, h, g, and y) have been defined in mammalian
cells. All four isoforms can be activated by MKK6; p38a and p38g

In conclusion, in this study we show that LeTx exhibits
significant antitumor activity in RCC xenograft models via an
antiangiogenic effect. Previous studies have shown that LeTx
induced dramatic apoptosis and cell death in melanoma cells and
indicated that LeTx may be useful as a therapeutic agent in clinical
trials of melanoma. The potent antiangiogenic effects of LeTx that
we showed here suggest that its use in clinical settings may not
restrict in melanoma. Given the highly vascularized nature of RCC,
LeTx warrants further study as a therapeutic agent for RCC.
