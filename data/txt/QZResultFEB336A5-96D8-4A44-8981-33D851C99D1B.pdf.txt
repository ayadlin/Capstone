Complex

Abstract
Most squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) overexpress ERBB1/EGFR, but EGF
receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies have yielded disappointing clinical results in treatment of this cancer.
Here, we describe a novel interaction between EGFR and the ligand EphrinB1 (EFNB1), and we show that
EFNB1 phosphorylation and downstream signaling persists in the presence of cetuximab. Mechanistically,
cetuximab drives a shift in EGFR dimerization partners within the signaling complex, suggesting that
targeted drugs may trigger partner rearrangements that allow persistent pathway activation. EFNB1
attenuation slowed tumor growth and increased survival in a murine model of HNSCC, suggesting a
substantial contribution of EFNB1 signaling to HNSCC development. Together, our ﬁndings suggest that
EFNB1 is part of the EGFR signaling complex and may mediate drug resistance in HNSCC as well as other
solid tumors. Cancer Res; 73(18); 5787–97. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
A greater understanding of the molecular pathways driving
tumor initiation and proliferation has heralded an age of targeted therapies for cancer. The therapeutic successes of these
drugs are satisfying from both the scientiﬁc and medical perspectives. Their failures indicate an incomplete understanding of macromolecular complexes, the oncogenic pathways
they drive, their cross-talk, and drug-driven compensatory
mechanisms. We have recently identiﬁed a novel component
of one such macromolecular complex in breast cancer (1).
Here, we further characterize its role in the context of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC).
In human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated HNSCC, the
high-risk HPV type 16 (HPV16) E6 oncoprotein targets the
cellular phosphatase, PTPN13, for degradation (2, 3). PTPN13
functions as a tumor suppressor (4–9), yet the molecular
mechanisms it modulates and how they become altered in
cancer remain unclear. One important PTPN13 phosphatase
substrate that may inﬂuence cancer initiation and/or progression is the signaling ligand EphrinB1 (EFNB1). EFNB1 belongs
to a ligand family that binds and activates Eph receptor
tyrosine kinases. Unlike most ligands, Ephrin ligands initiate
their own downstream signaling following receptor engage-

ment, a process called "reverse signaling" (10). PTPN13 transiently interacts with phosphorylated EFNB1, shutting "reverse
signaling" off (11). Thus, in tumors with impaired PTPN13
expression or function, EFNB1 signaling may persist. In addition, Ephrin ligands are promiscuous in their associations (12,
13); for example, EFNB1 interacts with ERBB2 (14). Moreover,
EFNB1 activation correlates with phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 (14). Together, these
studies suggest that the complex consisting of ERBB2/EFNB1
together with PTPN13 regulates intracellular signals critical for
epithelial tumorigenesis.
ERBB2 belongs to the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine
kinases, which includes ERBB1/EGFR/HER1. More than 90%
of HNSCC cases show upregulation of ERBB1 (15, 16), which
may impact tumor growth and patient outcomes. ERBB1targeted therapies such as cetuximab (Erbitux), a chimeric
anti-ERBB1 monoclonal antibody, and erlotinib (Tarceva), an
ERBB1 kinase inhibitor, are used as therapies in patients with
HNSCC although with modest clinical outcomes (17). These
clinical ﬁndings emphasize the need to better deﬁne components of macromolecular complexes active in disease, understand the molecular pathways they drive, and characterize how
they inﬂuence tumor initiation and progression. In the case
of HNSCC, these types of studies may help deﬁne what role,
if any, ERBB1 upregulation plays in disease initiation and/or
progression.
Our previous ﬁnding that EFNB1 associates with ERBB2
prompted us to ask whether it associates with other ERBB
family members. Here, we report that, like ERBB2, ERBB1
associates with EFNB1. Moreover, in the absence of PTPN13
function, EFNB1 phosphorylation is enhanced and ERK1/2
signaling is potentiated. These data suggest that EFNB1 exists
in a complex together with ERBB1, ERBB2, or both. A combination of these associations likely exists that together regulate

complex intracellular signals potentiated in the absence
of PTPN13 function. Importantly, we show that while antibody therapies such as cetuximab (Erbitux, anti-ERBB1) and
trastuzumab (Herceptin, anti-ERBB2) potently block receptor
activation, they do not attenuate EFNB1 activation or ERK1/2
phosphorylation. Moreover, we show that these ERBB-targeted
drugs promote the shifting of partners within ERBB/EFNB1
complexes and suggest that this mechanism supports persistent EFNB1 signaling despite potent ERBB receptor blockade. Thus, we propose that EFNB1 activation mediates signal
transduction and drug resistance. In addition, we show that
knockdown of EFNB1 signiﬁcantly slows tumor growth and
improves survival in a murine model of HNSCC. Together, our
ﬁndings support a tumor-suppressive role for PTPN13, suggest
that EFNB1 may be a useful therapeutic target in HNSCC and
other solid tumors, and explain at least one mechanism by
which HNSCCs fail cetuximab therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
HEK293, SCC1, and SCC47 cells were maintained with
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal
calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Primary murine
tonsil epithelia (1 MTE) and human tonsil epithelia (1 HTE)
were maintained with Keratinocyte Serum-Free Medium.
1MTE stably expressing HPV16 E6 and E7 together with RAS
and luciferase (MEERL cells) and 1 HTE stabley expressing
HPV16 E6 and E7 alone (HEE cells) were maintained with
E-medium (DMEM/Hams F12, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 8.4 ng/mL
cholera toxin, 5 mg/mL transferrin, 5 mg/mL insulin, 1.36 ng/mL
tri-iodo-thyonine, and 5 ng/mL EGF). HEE cells were generated
from 1 HTE cells harvested from tonsillectomies conducted for
noncancerous reasons and collected under Institutional Review
Board approval with written consent at the University of Iowa
(Iowa City, IA; ref. 3). The stable HEE cells were generated as
previously described (3, 18). We have authenticated these cell
lines by short-tandem repeat (STR) DNA proﬁling and veriﬁed
them with the reference STR proﬁle. Authentication was carried
out in the summer of 2012 at Genetica DNA Laboratories
(http://www.celllineauthentication.com/).
Plasmids
EFNB1-mutant constructs and PTPN13C/S have been previously described (6, 14). Wild-type (wt) human ERBB1 cDNA was
obtained from Addgene (#11011) and cloned by PCR into
pCMV-HA (Clontech). ERBB1 transmembrane mutants were
generated from the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wt ERBB1
construct using the QuickChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies).
Transfection
HEK293 cells were transfected using PolyFect Transfection
Reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 7.5,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mN Na3VO4, 100 mmol/L

NaF, 10 mmol/L NaPPi, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) and
soluble proteins assayed by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal
total protein was used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis by standard methodology. Antibodies for
immunoprecipitation were as follows: anti-ERBB1 (Becton
Dickinson), anti-ERBB2 (Dako), and anti-EFNB1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); antibodies used for immunoblot were as follows: anti-ERBB1 (Upstate), anti-ERBB2 (Invitrogen), antiphospho-tyrosine (Upstate), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Ambion), anti-EFNB1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-EFNB1 (Sigma), anti-phospho-ERK1/2
(Cell Signaling Technology), anti-ERK1/2 (Calbiochem), antiphospho-Tyrosine317 EFNB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-HA (Sigma), and anti-FLAG (Sigma).
Immunoﬂuorescence and proximity ligation assay
Antibodies for immunoﬂuorescence were as follows: antiERBB1 (Becton Dickinson), anti-ERBB2 (Dako), anti-HA (Sigma), anti-EFNB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-EFNB1
(Sigma). Surface EphrinB ligands were bound by EphB1-Fc
(R&D Systems) on unﬁxed, unpermeabilized cells and detected
with Millipore anti-human immunoglobulin G–ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate (IgG-FITC). Antibodies used for proximity ligation assay (PLA) were as follows: anti-ERBB1 (Becton Dickinson), anti-ERBB2 (Dako), anti-ERBB2 (Invitrogen), and antiEFNB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Standard immunoﬂuorescence and PLA protocols were followed.
Quantiﬁcation of PLA
PLA-positive signals (visualized as ﬂuorescent red dots)
were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Olympus FluoView1000, 60 oil objective, 2.5 magniﬁed; Alexa Fluor 568
detector). At least three stacked Z series for each condition
were analyzed, confocal IOB ﬁles converted to tiff format, and
then analyzed by DuoLink Imagetool software (Olink Biosciences). The number of PLA-positive signals from at least
three different Z-stacked images per condition was averaged.
Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar
results. Student t test was used to analyze the data and test for
signiﬁcance.
Targeted therapy treatment
Cells were grown on 60-mm tissue culture dishes to 80%
conﬂuence and treated with recombinant EGF (SAFC Biosciences) in the presence or absence of cetuximab (20 mg/mL;
Imclone), trastuzumab (10 mg/mL; Dako), or their combination
for 1 hour at 37 C. Control cells received either no treatment or
EGF alone. Cells were harvested as described earlier and
analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis.
For analysis by PLA, cells were seeded on 16-well chamber
slides and treated as described followed by processing for PLA
(as described earlier).
Generating stable cell lines
Cells were seeded onto 6-well tissue culture dishes and
transfected using PolyFect Transfection Reagent as described earlier. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were
placed under antibiotic selection with Zeocin (250, 500, or

1,000 mg/mL; Invitrogen), clones were picked and transferred
to 48-well dishes, maintained under selection, and passaged
up to 100-mm dishes, at which time one dish was lysed for
biochemical analysis and another frozen for later use.
In vivo studies
All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Cells were
trypsinized and harvested from tissue culture plates and
resuspended. An 18-gauge needle with 100,000 cells was
injected subcutaneously into the right hind limb of each
C57Bl/6 mouse (N ¼ 5/group). C57Bl/6 male mice were 4 to
6 weeks of age, weighed at least 20 to 25 g, and were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory. Injected cells included: parental
cells, nonsilencing, wt mEfnB1, or short hairpin (sh) EfnB1.
Weekly caliper measurements were taken and tumor volume
was calculated as follows: (width)2(depth). Mice were humanely euthanized when tumors reached 2 cm in the greatest
dimension or the animal became emaciated or had functional
impairment of the leg.

Results
EFNB1 associates with ERBB1 and ERBB2
To test whether ERBB1 and EFNB1 interact, two HNSCC cell
lines were processed for immunoﬂuorescence: the SCC1 cell
line is HPV negative (HPV), whereas the SCC47 cell line is
HPV-positive (HPVþ). Surface, rather than total, EphrinB was
localized because cells robustly express intracellular EphrinB
ligands making the distinction of surface expression difﬁcult.
EphB1-Fc binding followed by IgG-FITC localizes surface
EphrinB ligands. Both cell lines express ERBB1 and EphrinB,
which colocalize at cell–cell borders (Fig. 1A and B).
To verify that the colocalization by immunoﬂuorescence
involved ERBB1 and EFNB1 speciﬁcally, PLA and coimmunoprecipitation studies were conducted. Figure 1C shows positive
PLA signals for EFNB1 and ERBB1 in SCC1 (HPV) and SCC47
(HPVþ) cells. The previously discovered ERBB2/EFNB1 association (14) was conﬁrmed and the presence of ERBB1/ERBB2
heterodimers was determined (Fig. 1C). In addition, stained Zstacked images in the XZ plane indicate that these interactions
are not restricted to the cell surface but also occur within the
cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). These intracellular PLA signals likely
represent internalized complexes. Importantly, PLA quantiﬁcation shows that infection with HPV16 correlates with
enhanced ERBB/EFNB1 interactions (Fig. 1E). EFNB1, ERBB1,
and ERBB2 protein levels in SCC1 (HPV) and SCC47 (HPVþ)
cells are very similar (Fig. 3), thus increased protein expression
cannot account for the enhanced interactions evident in SCC47
(HPVþ) cells.
EFNB1 and ERBB1 association is likely mediated via
their transmembrane domains
Because of the overwhelming expression of ERBB1 in
HNSCCs, we focused further analysis on ERBB1 and EFNB1.
To deﬁne the domains necessary and sufﬁcient for ERBB1/
EFNB1 association, we generated deletion mutants (Fig. 2A).
All ERBB1 mutants, including the full-length wt, were HAtagged; constructs express well, run at the predicted molecular

www.aacrjournals.org

weight, and possess the HA tag (Fig. 2B). To test whether any of
the ERBB1 deletions compromise its interaction with EFNB1,
HEK293 cells were transfected, lysates immunoprecipitated for
EFNB1 and immunoblotted for HA. Surprisingly, no loss of
coimmunoprecipitation with any ERBB1 mutants occurred,
suggesting that the extracellular ligand-binding domains of
ERBB1 are not required for its association with EFNB1 (Fig. 2B).
These data are consistent with our previous ﬁnding for the
ERBB2/EFNB1 interaction (14). EFNB1 deletion mutants and
wt constructs have been previously described and were all
FLAG-tagged (14). Brieﬂy, either the entire extracellular
domain (EFNB1-ED) or just the intracellular PDZ-binding
motif (EFNB1-PDZ) of EFNB1 was deleted. HEK293 cells were
transfected with the EFNB1 constructs. Because HEK293 cells
express nearly undetectable endogenous ERBB1, cells were
also transfected with untagged wt ERBB1. Immunoprecipitation for ERBB1 followed by Western blot analysis for FLAG
shows no loss of coimmunoprecipitation with any of the
EFNB1 mutants, suggesting that neither the extracellular
domain nor the PDZ motif is required for its association with
ERBB1 (Fig. 2C).
ERBB receptor transmembrane domains mediate homoand hetero-dimerization (19, 20). In fact, ERBB transmembrane
domains contain two motifs: one mediating heterodimerization, the other homodimerization (21). To test whether
ERBB10 s transmembrane domain mediates its interaction with
EFNB1, two additional ERBB1 mutants were generated: one
within the ﬁrst transmembrane motif and another within the
second transmembrane motif. These constructs were HAtagged and transfected into HEK293 cells. Control cells were
transfected with wt HA-tagged ERBB1 or enhanced GFP
(eGFP). Lysates were immunoprecipitated for EFNB1 and
analyzed by Western blot analysis for HA. Although the ﬁrst
ERBB1 transmembrane motif mutant, T648I G652I, retains
coimmunoprecipitation with EFNB1, mutation within the
second transmembrane motif (A661I G665I) loses it (Fig.
2D). These data were veriﬁed by immunoﬂuorescence. HEK293
cells were transfected as described and cells processed for
immunoﬂuorescence using an anti-HA antibody for ERBB1
detection and an anti-EFNB1 antibody for EFNB1 detection.
Expression of the ERBB1 T648I G652I mutant (green) colocalizes with endogenous EFNB1 (red), evident in the merged
panel (yellow). Expression of the ERBB1 A661I G665I (green)
does not colocalize with EFNB1 (red; Fig. 2E). Together, these
data suggest that ERBB10 s second transmembrane motif mediates the EFNB1 association.
Expression of HPV oncogenes correlates with EFNB1 and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HNSCC. We and others have
shown that PTPN13 regulates EFNB1 phosphorylation. Moreover, the loss of PTPN13 expression, as seen in basal-like breast
cancer, correlates with enhanced EFNB1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (14, 22). Importantly, breast tumors compromised
for PTPN13 expression are associated with decreased overall
survival (23). A similar dysregulation in signaling occurs in
HNSCC, both in a human cell line (SCC84) and a murine model
of head and neck cancer (14). Thus, we wondered whether
EFNB10 s phosphorylation state modulates its interactions with
ERBB receptors. In addition, given that tonsil epithelial cells

EFNB1 interactions exist in these cells. Thus, 1 HTE and HTEs
stably expressing HEE were tested. Consistent with our previous studies, ERBB1 and ERBB2 associate with EFNB1 in both
cell types (Fig. 3A). In addition, expression of E6 correlates with
enhanced phosphorylation of EFNB1 and ERK1/2 consistent
with previous reports (2, 3). These data show that ERBB1 and
ERBB2 associate with EFNB1 in primary human tonsil cells as
well as those expressing HPV oncogenes. Moreover EFNB1
associates with its ERBB partners regardless of its phosphorylation status. Importantly, expression of HPV16 oncogenes
(HEE cells) enhances EFNB1 activation and subsequent ERK1/
2 phosphorylation. These data are consistent with our previous
ﬁndings that EFNB1 signals down the mitogen-activated pro-

in 1 MTE cells and a previously characterized mouse model of
HPV-related HNSCC (MTEs expressing MEERL cells; Supplementary Fig. S1; refs. 18, 24, 25).
PTPN13 regulates EFNB1 phosphorylation and reverse
signaling
HPV16 E6 mediates the degradation of PTPN13 (2, 3). The
data suggest that enhanced EFNB1 activation and downstream
signaling are a consequence of this degradation (Fig. 3A).
To directly test this, we conducted a series of transfections
in HEK293 cells, which express nearly undetectable ERBB
receptors allowing us to control expression of the proteins
involved. Brieﬂy, HEK293 cells were transfected with wt ERBB1,

PTPN13C/S) and lysates analyzed by Western blot analysis. In
eGFP-transfected controls, endogenous EFNB1 is phosphorylated (Fig. 3B). The multiple bands likely represent different
phosphorylated forms of EFNB1 as suggested by Xu and
colleagues (26). In addition, a low level of EFNB1 coimmunoprecipitations with ERBB1 yet ERK1/2 is not phosphorylated.
Transfection with wt ERBB1, wt EFNB1, and wt PTPN13
decreases EFNB1 phosphorylation without altering its association with ERBB1; ERK1/2 remains unphosphorylated.
Interestingly, transfection with wt ERBB1, wt EFNB1, and
PTPN13C/S, a phosphatase null PTPN13-mutant, increases
EFNB1 phosphorylation as well as its association with ERBB1
and initiates ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Together, these data
are consistent with those of others showing that PTPN13
regulates EFNB1 phosphorylation. In addition, the data suggest that phosphorylated EFNB1 associates more readily with
ERBB1 and that the loss of PTPN13 function potentiates not
only EFNB1 phosphorylation but also ERK1/2 signaling.

ERBB1 and ERBB2 antibody blockade do not attenuate
downstream signaling
ERBB1- and ERBB2-targeted therapies are in clinical use for
treatment of a variety of solid cancers including HNSCC. Our
data suggest that PTPN13 modulates EFNB1-mediated signaling and that EFNB1 associates with ERBB1 and ERBB2. To test
whether ERBB1- and/or ERBB2-targeted therapies alter EFNB1
activation and downstream signaling, we analyzed SCC1
(HPV) and SCC47 (HPVþ) cells. Cells were treated with EGF
to stimulate ERBB receptor activation and then segregated
into the following groups: (i) untreated (EGF alone, control),
(ii) treated with cetuximab, (iii) treated with trastuzumab, or
(iv) treated with both cetuximab and trastuzumab. Unstimulated (no EGF) and untreated cells (EGF alone) served as
control. Figure 4 shows Western blot analysis of these groups.
Both SCC1 (HPV) and SCC47 (HPVþ) cells show nearly undetectable endogenous ERBB1 or ERBB2 phosphorylation
(unstimulated). In addition, and consistent with clinical data,
cells abundantly express ERBB1 and modestly express ERBB2

(15, 16, 27–31). EGF stimulation activates ERBB1 and ERBB2,
suggesting that at least a fraction of ERBB1 heterodimerizes
with ERBB2. Treatment with cetuximab alone potently attenuates EGF-mediated ERBB1 and ERBB2 phosphorylation, suggesting that ERBB2 phosphorylation following EGF stimulation occurs via heterodimerization with ERBB1. As expected,
trastuzumab has no effect on ERBB1 phosphorylation but
attenuates ERBB2 activation. Treatment with a combination
of cetuximab and trastuzumab is not additive. In other words,
treatment with drugs in combination does not enhance the
effect of each drug when given in isolation. Importantly,
despite the ability of cetuximab and trastuzumab to attenuate
receptor activation, neither showed an effect on ERK phosphorylation; that is, ERK1/2 remains phosphorylated despite
the presence of drug. These data suggest that downstream
signaling persists despite ERBB1 and/or ERBB2 blockade. This
ﬁnding is consistent with previous reports (32). Importantly,
while EGF stimulation enhances phosphorylation of EFNB1 on
tyrosine 317, neither cetuximab nor trastuzumab (alone or in
combination) attenuate this. On the basis of our previous
ﬁnding that EFNB1 signals via the MAPK pathway (14), these

data suggest that persistent signaling via EFNB1 drives ERK1/2
phosphorylation despite blockade of ERBB1 and ERBB2.
Treatment with cetuximab or trastuzumab (together or
in combination) drives the shifting of partners within
ERBB/EFNB1 complexes
Given that EFNB1 associates with ERBB1 and ERBB2, we
wondered whether treatment with targeted drugs mediates
changes in partner associations within these complexes that
might account for sustained signaling in the presence of drug.
To test this, the experiments carried out in Fig. 4 were duplicated on 16-well chamber slides, cells were processed for PLA,
and quantiﬁed. In SCC1 (HPV) cells, stimulation with EGF
alone (control; light gray) results in modest association of
ERBB1 with EFNB1 (Fig. 5A). ERBB2 interactions with EFNB1
are more abundant in comparison, suggesting that the preferred partner for EFNB1 is ERBB2. In addition, ERBB1 and
ERBB2 heterodimers are in the minority. Treatment of cells
with EGF þ cetuximab (black bars) leads to a signiﬁcant
increase in ERBB1/EFNB1 interactions (P ¼ 0.03), a signiﬁcant
decrease in ERBB2/EFNB1 interactions (P ¼ 0.0001), whereas

Figure 4. EFNB1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation persist in presence of
cetuximab and trastuzumab therapies. SCC1 and SCC47 cells were
treated with EGF alone (control) or in combination with cetuximab (cetux),
trastuzumab (traztuz), or both (cetuxþtrastuz) and analyzed by Western
blot analysis as indicated. Cells alone (unstimulated) served as an
additional control. IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblot.

ERBB1/ERBB2 heterodimerization is signiﬁcantly enhanced
(P ¼ 0.04). On the other hand, treatment with EGF þ trastuzumab (blue bars) has no effect on the number of interactions
formed between ERBB1 and EFNB1; however, EFNB10 s association with ERBB2 decreases (P ¼ 0.03), whereas ERBB1/ERBB2
heterodimers signiﬁcantly increase (P ¼ 0.01). Finally, treatment with a combination of EGF, cetuximab, and trastuzumab
(dark gray bars) also results in partner shifts. ERBB1/EFNB1
associations decrease (P ¼ 0.01), whereas ERBB1/ERBB2 heterodimerization increases (P ¼ 0.03). Interactions between
ERBB2 and EFNB1 remain unchanged. In SCC47 (HPVþ) cells
(Fig. 5B), treatment with targeted drugs showed similar trends
as those evident with SCC1 (HPV) cells though signiﬁcance
was not reached in any condition. Nonetheless, these PLA data
together with the biochemical analysis of these experiments
(Fig. 4) suggest that partner shifting occurs in the presence of
targeted therapies and may explain the sustained activation
of EFNB1 and ERK1/2 evident in the presence of drug.
Loss of EFNB1 decreases tumor growth in an in vivo
model of HNSCC
The data suggest that EFNB1 associates with ERBB1 and
ERBB2 (alone or in combination) and that PTPN13 modulates
these interactions by regulating EFNB1 phosphorylation and
downstream signaling. Although ERBB1 and ERBB2 roles in
tumor growth have been appreciated for some times, we
wanted to directly test EFNB10 s function in tumor growth
using a previously described murine model of HPVþ HNSCC
(18, 24, 25). In these cells, HPV16 E6–mediated degradation of
PTPBL (the murine homolog of PTPN13) results in enhanced
EFNB1 phosphorylation and downstream ERK1/2 signaling
(14). Brieﬂy, MTE cells stably expressing MEERL cells were
transfected with the pcDNA3.1 Zeocin expression vector con-

taining either wt murine Efnb1 (wt mEnfb1) or an short hairpin
RNA (shRNA)-targeting Efnb1 (shEfnb1). Transfection with a
nonsilencing shRNA (nonsilencing) as well as the parental cells
served as controls. Cells were ring-cloned and clones tested
biochemically. More than 50 clones were analyzed by Western
blot analysis with only modest overexpression or knockdown
of EFNB1 evident. However, immunoﬂuorescence localization
of surface expression shows abundant increase in wt mEfnb1
clones and decrease in shEfnb1 clones (Fig. 6A). These ﬁndings
are consistent with our previous observations that abundant
intracellular EFNB1 expression precludes Western blot analysis detection of surface expression changes. Thus, selection of
clones was based predominantly on immunoﬂuorescence
surface EFNB1 localization. To test the role of EFNB1 in tumor
growth in vivo, 100,000 cells of each clone were injected into the
hind limb of C57Bl/6 mice, N ¼ 5 mice per group. Tumor
growth was measured weekly. wt mEfnb1 tumors grew significantly faster than parental and shEfnb1 tumors (P < 0.001).
However, tumor growth of the wt mEfnb1 group was not
signiﬁcantly different than that of the nonsilencing control
group (P ¼ 0.42). Given that the wt mEfnb1 group was
signiﬁcantly different than the parental group, we speculate
that the nonsilencing construct mediates off-targets effects
that account for this difference in tumor growth with the wt
mEfnb1 group. Importantly, mice bearing shEfnb1 tumors had
signiﬁcantly slower tumor growth compared with all other
groups (P < 0.001) at all time points up to 20 days, at which time
mice from the other groups reached sacriﬁce criteria (Fig. 6B).
Consistent with tumor growth, mice bearing parental tumors
survived signiﬁcantly longer than those bearing wt mEfnb1 or
nonsilencing tumors (P < 0.001), whereas shEfnb1 bearing mice
survived signiﬁcantly longer (P < 0.001) than the other groups
(Fig. 6C). These data show that EFNB1 signiﬁcantly affects
tumor growth and survival, suggesting it is a good candidate for
therapeutic targeting in HNSCC and other solid tumors.

Discussion
We describe a novel association in HNSCC consisting of
ERBB1 and EFNB1. ERBB2 is also a part of this complex,
consistent with previous ﬁndings (14). Loss of PTPN13 function increases EFNB1 phosphorylation, enhances EFNB10 s
interaction with ERBB1, and correlates with potentiated
ERK1/2 activation. Our data do not test whether ERBB1
directly phosphorylates EFNB1 or whether other components
exist within this complex that mediate EFNB1 phosphorylation. However, previous studies suggest that SRC kinase
phosphorylates EFNB1 following cognate receptor engagement (10) and our previous studies support this role for SRC
(14). Whether SRC is recruited to EFNB1 when complexed to
ERBB1 remains to be tested. Regardless of the mechanism,
increased EFNB1 phosphorylation correlates with ERK1/2
phosphorylation.
Importantly, we show that ERBB10 s transmembrane domain
mediates the association with EFNB1. These data predict that
ERBB1-targeted therapies (which bind extracellular, cetuximab, or intracellular, erlotinib, epitopes) alone will be inefﬁcient in blocking intracellular signaling mediated by this
complex, as EFNB1 is likely impervious to them. Cetuximab's

binding site on ERBB1 has been solved (33). The extracellular
domain of ERBB1 is subdivided into four subdomains (I–IV;
ref. 34). EGF binds epitopes on domains I and III, whereas
cetuximab binds only to domain III, yet overlaps with the
domain III epitope bound by EGF. Thus, cetuximab binding is
sufﬁcient to sterically inhibit EGF binding. ERBB10 s extracellular domains do not mediate its interaction with EFNB1,
strongly suggesting that cetuximab binding will not inhibit it.
Trastuzumab binds an epitope within the juxtamembrane
region of extracellular domain IV of ERBB2 (35). Our previous
ﬁndings show that ERBB20 s extracellular domains do not
mediate its association with EFNB1 (14), and therefore, trastuzumab binding likely will not affect this interaction.
In cancers with decreased or lost PTPN13 function, ERBB/
EFNB1 associations and signaling may be potentiated. We
tested these possibilities and found that indeed, while treatment with cetuximab potently blocked ERBB1 activation,
EFNB1 phosphorylation persisted as did that of ERK1/2.
Trastuzumab treatment yielded similar results and the com-

bination of these targeted therapies showed no ill effect on
EFNB1 phosphorylation or downstream signaling. The ﬁndings
were strikingly similar in both HPVþ and HPV cells suggesting that HPV status does not alter drug efﬁcacy. However, the
PLA data show that HPV infection promotes ERBB/EFNB1
interactions (Fig. 1E), whereas analysis of these interactions in
the context of drug treatment showed no signiﬁcant differences in the HPVþ cells (Fig. 5B). We speculate this is a
reﬂection of the increased number of associations due to HPV
infection in these cells and suggest that a maximal threshold of
total ERBB/EFNB1 interactions per cell may exist such that
once this threshold is reached, conditions that would otherwise drive signiﬁcant changes become difﬁcult to discern. In
addition, we noted a higher variability in the number of
interactions for some conditions, which also affected attainment of statistical signiﬁcance. Taken together, however, these
data explain, at least in part, the modest clinical beneﬁts
evident with cetuximab in the HNSCC setting. In addition, the
data suggest that dual targeting of ERBB1 and ERBB2 likely will

not yield better results than either drug alone. This has in fact
been shown for HNSCC cell lines (36). Moreover, a randomized
phase II study using lapatinib, a dual ERBB1 and ERBB2
inhibitor, showed no signiﬁcant difference in objective
response rate between lapatinib and placebo (37). These ﬁndings are not unique to HNSCC but seem to be the rule rather
than the exception in a majority of solid tumors. For example,
in a subset of molecularly classiﬁed breast tumors that overexpressed ERBB2, trastuzumab therapy proved beneﬁcial for

www.aacrjournals.org

only a minority of patients, whereas most showed de novo or
acquired trastuzumab resistance (38).
The ﬁnding that targeted drugs promote shifting of partners
within ERBB/EFNB1 complexes emphasizes the complexity of
macromolecular complexes, their roles in disease and suggests
that targeted drugs may drive the progression of tumors. As
with other solid tumors, it is increasingly evident that targeting
a single element lacks long-term clinical efﬁcacy. These ﬁndings strongly show that silencing or eliminating a single
oncogenic driver merely imposes evolutionary forces that
promote alternative mechanisms to maintain, or even potentiate, the cancerous phenotype. This may be best exempliﬁed
by non–small cell lung cancer in which patients with classic
ERBB1 mutations (L858R and exon 19 deletions) initially
respond to ERBB1-targeted therapies, yet eventually acquire
a secondary mutation, T790M, which confers resistance (39).
Multipronged approaches for effective treatment have been
proposed for several cancers (40–43). Our current ﬁndings that
targeted therapies drive shifting of partners within a multikinase/ligand/phosphatase complex strongly support these
proposals. Along these lines, the use of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab shows promise for patients with
HER2 breast cancer (44, 45). Pertuzumab binds an extracellular
epitope within domain II of ERBB2 and blocks dimerization
with other ERBB family members (46). Our data show that in
SCC1 cells, ERBB1/2 heterodimers are in the minority and only
become a major dimer group following cetuximab treatment
(Fig. 5A). The current study did not evaluate ERBB3 or ERBB4,
therefore it is unclear what role they may play in the multikinase/ligand/phosphatase complex described. However, given our ﬁnding that the transmembrane domain of ERBB1
mediates the association with EFNB1, it seems unlikely that
pertuzumab will abrogate ERBB/EFNB1 interactions. The role
of ERBB transmembrane domains in mediating dimer formation is well established (47–49). Our ﬁnding that the transmembrane also is critical for EFNB1 associations, strongly
suggests that small molecules able to abolish transmembrane
interactions may effectively block dimer associations of multiple signaling molecules not limited to the ERBB family. Such
drugs may have potent clinical efﬁcacy. Our data also suggest
that EFNB1-targeted therapy may be of clinical value. In all, the
data suggest that blocking formation of the complex as
opposed to blocking individual components within the complex may provide better tumor growth control and clinical
outcomes.
In summary, the present ﬁndings are consistent with published data and support a tumor-suppressive function for
PTPN13 (2, 14). These studies conﬁrm our previous ﬁndings
that EFNB1 associates with members of the ERBB receptor
tyrosine kinases. For those cancers with upregulation of ERBB1
(such as HNSCC), its association with EFNB1 may signiﬁcantly
affect tumorigenesis. Moreover, acquisition of PTPN13 loss-offunction mutations or its decreased expression (due to HPV
infection or epigenetic silencing) may further enhance ERBB1/
EFNB1–mediated signals. Our study suggests that EFNB1 is an
important target for therapeutic intervention and that combinatorial targeted therapy approaches must include ERBB1,
ERBB2, as well as EFNB1 and possibly SRC for quenching

focus on HNSCC, EFNB1 complexes with ERBB2 in breast
cancer where loss of PTPN13 correlates with decreased overall
survival (14) and thus, we speculate that a similar complex
exists in breast tumors (and possibly other solid tumors),
suggesting that a multitargeted drug approach may be beneﬁcial in this setting as well.
