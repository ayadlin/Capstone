ABSTRACT
Background: EDC1 is a novel type of antibody-drug conjugate which binds and
inhibits the Na,K-ATPase on the surface of cancer cells expressing dysadherin. The
purpose of this study was to determine the expression of dysadherin in different types of
thyroid carcinoma, and evaluate the therapeutic potential of EDC1 for thyroid carcinomas.
Methods: Thyroid tissues from 158 patients were examined for dysadherin
expression and correlation with clinicopathological features. Thyroid cancer cell lines
were examined for the expression of dysadherin and effective dose range of EDC1.
Results: One in 53 benign thyroid tissues and 62% of thyroid cancers expressed
dysadherin. All anaplastic and a majority of papillary thyroid cancers overexpressed
dysadherin, while 25% of follicular thyroid cancers was found to be positive for
dysadherin. Dysadherin expression significantly correlated with extrathyroidal
extension and lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid cancer. Five of six human
thyroid cancer cell lines analyzed expressed high levels of dysadherin. Of those cells
lines sensitive to EDC1, half maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were observed
to be between 0.125 nM and 1 nM.
Conclusions: EDC1 showed selective inhibition of growth in thyroid cancer cells
with moderate to high expression of dysadherin, thus could be a specific and effective
treatment.

from the lack of the sodium/iodide symporter (SLC5A5)
[7, 8, 9], resulting in decreased survival [8, 10]. Unlike
its well-differentiated counterparts, the prognosis for
aggressive thyroid cancers is dismal [6, 11] and new
treatment modalities are needed in light of the limited
options for these patients [12, 13, 14].
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) have been
discovered as successful options for treating human
malignancies. ADC allows the targetted delivery of a
highly cytotoxic agents to antigens specifically expressed
by cancer cells but not by normal cells. The high clinical
efficacy of two ADCs lead to their approvals by the Food

INTRODUCTION
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine
malignancy and the most rapidly increasing cancer
in the U.S [1]. While generally thyroid cancers are
highly curable with the recommended treatment of
thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation [2],
anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and about 20% of welldifferentiated thyroid cancers present a more aggressive
phenotype of distant metastasis or recurrence associated
with increased mortality [3–6]. Many of these aggressive
thyroid cancers do not concentrate radioactive iodide

and Drug Administration (FDA); brentuximab vedotin
targets CD30 expressed in Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and
ado-trastuzumab emtansine targets the HER2 antigen
expressed in some metastatic breast cancer [15–18].
Similar to CD30 and HER2, dysadherin is a cell
membrane glycoprotein recentyly discovered on variety
of malignant cells, including thyroid [19], colorectal,
pancreatic, esophageal, gastric, cervical, testicular, breast,
head and neck carcinomas, and malignant melanoma
[20–30]. Although the biological role of dysadherin is still
being elucidated, previous studies show that it promotes
invasiveness by up regulating CCL2 and down regulating
E-cadherin1, enhances the activity of the NF-κB pathway,
and promotes metastasis through a mechanism that
involves enhanced AKT activation [31, 32].
Interestingly, dysadherin surface expression is
limited on normal cells and rarely expressed on nonneoplastic cells of the types associated with dysadherin
positive malignancies studied to date. This feature of
specificity makes dysadherin a very promising target for
ADC development. We therefore utilized a highly potent
type of ADC called EDC1. EDC1 is a non-internalizing
extracellular drug conjugate composed of an antidysadherin antibody (NCC-M53) conjugated to CEN-106,
a novel Na,K-ATPase inhibitor known to induce necrosis
in human cancer cell types [33].
This study more comprehensively examined the
expression of dysadherin in different types of thyroid
pathologies and assessed the potential for EDC1 as a
treatment for aggressive thyroid cancers by evaluating the
efficacy of EDC1 on human thyroid cancer lines.

in Table 1. Among all the cases evaluated, there were
10 normal thyroids, 10 nodular goiters, 11 Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis (HT), 32 follicular adenomas (FA), 28
papillary carcinomas (PTC), 29 follicular variant papillary
carcinoma (FV-PTC), 28 follicular carcinomas (FTC)
and 10 anaplastic carcinomas (ATC), with a total of 63
benign and 95 malignant thyroid pathologies. Female
predominance was seen in each group. As expected, the
ATC patients were older (mean age of 70 years old) than
patients with HT, FA, and well-differentiated thyroid
carcinomas.

Expression in different pathological types and
representative patterns
The most representative areas of the formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded thyroid tissues were assembled in
tissue microarray (TMA) and the expression of dysadherin
was examined by immunohistochemistry. Table 2 lists
the most common intensity of dysadherin in all the
positive cases observed in the different types of thyroid
carcinomas. Dysadherin expression was not detectable in
most non-malignant thyroid tissues including all normal
thyroid, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and follicular adenoma
(representative tissue samples shown in Figure 1A, 1C
and 1D, respectively). Only 1 out of 10 nodular goiter
showed a weak dysadherin expression (1+) in the cell
membrane of thyroid follicular cells (Figure 1B). On
the other hand, most of the malignant thyroid tumors
(59/95) demonstrated moderate (2+) to strong (3+) cell
membrane immunoreactivity for dysadherin (62% vs. 2%
in benign group, p<0.001) with diffused pattern localized
predominantly to the cell membrane. Dysadherin was
strongly expressed (3+) in all ATCs (100%, Figure 1H)
while moderate positivity (2+) was seen in 7 FTCs (25%,
Figure 1F). ATC showed the most intense and the most
diffuse pattern of dysadherin expression. A total of 42
PTCs (74%) showed positive staining for dysadherin

including 24 classic PTCs and 18 FV-PTCs. A slight

classical and follicular variant of PTC. Less patients with

anaplastic (8505C) thyroid cancer cell lines (Figure 2),
consistent with the immunohistochemistry data. However,
there was a moderate expression of dysadherin in FTC133
and no expression in HTh7 thyroid cancer cells.
We also characterized the human thyroid cancer
cells by immunofluorescence for dysadherin. As
shown in Figure 3E, 8505c cells have a strong specific
immunofluorescence signal, both in the cytoplasm and
the cell membrane, while HTh7 cells (Figure 3F) have
a markedly diminished immunofluorescence, which is
consistent with the Western blot results. Both papillary
and follicular cell lines expressed a more modest amount
of immunofluorescence. All the cell lines that expressed
dysadherin stained positively in the cytoplasm, but TPC1
and 8505c cells exhibited a stronger signal from the cell
membrane. As expected, there was no immunofluorescence
in the negative controls of the respective cell lines.

Clinical relevance of dysadherin expression
The clinical utility of using dysadherin expression as
a potential marker for aggressive characteristics of thyroid
cancer and adverse clinical outcomes was examined. Our
relatively larger sample size of PTC tissues allowed for
the correlation of tumor characteristics with dysadherin
expression within the same pathology. Majority of
classical and follicular variant of PTC (86% and 62%
positivity respectively) overexpressed dysadherin.
The clinicopathological correlations with dysadherin
overexpression in PTCs are summarized in Table 3. In
PTCs, the overexpression of dysadherin was significantly
associated with the presence of extrathyroidal extension
and lymph node metastases (p=0.045 and p=0.017
respectively), but not with older age, gender, tumor size,
focality, or distant metastases. For both extrathyroidal
extension and lymph node metastasis, positive expression
of dysadherin was seen in 93% and 95% of the cases
respectively. However they also exhibited moderate false
positive rate (67% and 63% respectively).

EDC1 inhibited growth in dysadherin positive
cell lines
We hypothesized that while EDC1 would target the
warhead drug to dysadherin expression cell, the warhead
drug conjugated to a non-specific polyclonal antibody
(negative control) would be less cytotoxic to thyroid cancer
cells. To demonstrate the potency of EDC1 on thyroid
cancer cytotoxicity, we examined the six human thyroid
cancer cell lines using the MTT cellular growth assay.
All the significantly affected cell lines achieved their half
of the maximal inhibitory effect (EC50) in the nanomolar
range of ECD1 and expressed at least a moderate amount
of dysadherin on Western blot analysis (Figure 2). Both
8505c (ATC) and BCPAP (PTC) thyroid cancer cell lines
achieved EC50 at doses below 0.2 nM (Figure 1A and 1C).
As previously noted, these cell lines demonstrated strong
expression of dysadherin on their cell membranes. TPC1
(PTC) and FTC236 (FTC) thyroid cancer cell lines showed
moderate expression of dysadherin and were sensitive to
EDC1, demonstrating EC50 below 1.7nM (Figure 4B and

Dysadherin expressed in human thyroid cancer
cell lines
Six established unique human thyroid cancer cell
lines were tested for the baseline level expression of
dysadherin as a potential target for ADCs. Western blot
using mAb NCC-M53, a monoclonal antibody against
dysadherin, showed that dysadherin is highly expressed
in papillary (TPC and BCPAP), follicular (FTC236) and

4E). No effect was observed in FTC133 which moderately
expressed dysadherin (Figure 4F).
To show that the growth suppressive effect
of EDC1 is specific to dysadherin positive cells, an
MTT assay was also performed on a dysadherin nonexpressing cell line HTh7 (Figure 4D). As expected,
EDC1 in doses as high as 8nM had no effect on cellular
proliferation in HTh7. The antibody by itself has already
been demonstrated to have no effect [33]. In addition,

when all thyroid cancer cell lines were treated with the
same drug that was conjugated to a non-specific antibody
(negative control), no effect was observed on cell
proliferation in any of the six thyroid cancer cell lines
as expected. This illustrates that the cytotoxicity of the
warhead drug is limited by conjugation to an antibody,
and that its anti-proliferative effect only occurs in cancer
cells that specifically express the target of the conjugated
antibody.

DISCUSSION

When human umbilical artery endothelial cell line
(UAEC), umbilical vein endothelial cell line (UVEC), and
renal epithelial cell line (REC) were treated with EDC1 in
the same manner (Figure 5), very limited cytotoxicity was
observed (EC50 = 52nM, 37nM, >100nM respectively)
with the EC50 much higher compared to those of the
thyroid cancer cell lines. Taken together, these results
suggest that EDC1 is more potent against thyroid cancer
cells than against non-cancerous cells.

The incidence rate of thyroid cancer more than
doubled since 1999 and more than tripled since 1973,
reaching 15.07 per 100,000 [34]. An increase has been
also evident worldwide [35]. Approximately 90% are
classified as well-differentiated, including PTC and FTC
[36]. The most common variant of PTC is the follicular
variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FV-PTC) which
may account up to 41% of PTCs [2]. While these welldifferentiated thyroid cancers are highly treatable,
undifferentiated thyroid cancers such as ATC and 20%
of well-differentiated thyroid cancers do not respond to
conventional treatments, manifest with metastatic and/or
recurrent disease, and lead to increased mortality [3, 6].
Though anaplastic cancers only make up less than 2% of
all the cases of thyroid cancer, they represent over half of
the thyroid cancer-related deaths, and the mean survival
time is less than 6 months from diagnosis [5]. These
aggressive thyroid cancers are still a clinical challenge and
the research of new treatment strategies is ongoing.

The cell surface molecule dysadherin gained
a widespread attention after the discovery that its
overexpression is highly associated with metastatic
potential and poorer prognosis in breast cancers [37].
Subsequent studies established the expression patterns
and clinical correlations of dysadherin in many other
cancers, exploring its value as a potential drug target and/
or prognostic marker [32]. For example, studies examining
squamous cell carcinoma [29] and cutaneous malignant
melanoma [27] showed that dysadherin expression is
an indepdentent predictor of poor survival. In majority
of the cancers, dysadherin expression is correlated with
local invasion, distant metastasis, and higher tumor
grade [20–30]. In our current study, we show that
dysadherin is highly expressed in all ATCs, moderately
expressed in tissue samples of PTCs (85%) including
FV-PTCs (62%), and seldom expressed in FTC (25%),
which are consistent with a previous study [19]. We also
demonstrate that these immunohistochemistry findings
are consistent with Western blot and immunofluorescence
detection of dysadherin in human thyroid cancer cell
lines. Furthermore, dysadherin expression in PTCs was
associated with extrathyroidal extension and lymph node
metastases, but not with older age, tumor size, focality, or
distant metastases.
Previous studies have shown that both differentiated
and undifferentiated thyroid cancers also express
dysadherin [19, 38] and that its expression is higher in
aggressive undifferentiated thyroid cancers compared to
the differentiated subtypes. In these studies, its expression
correlated with tumor size, distant metastasis, regional
lymph node metastasis, and disease specific survival
in thyroid cancer, which is similar to the findings in
our current study with the exception of the negative
association of dysadherin overexpression with tumor size
and distant metastases. The difference may stem from
the fact that the previous study correlated the presence
of distance metastasis and tumor size with the degree
of dysadherin expression across both differentiated and
aggressive undifferentiated thyroid cancers while our
study solely analyzed PTCs which are known to be welldifferentiated and unaggressive. In our study only one of

57 PTCs showed distant metastases, which overexpressed
dysadherin.
Given the association between dysadherin
expression and aggressive thyroid cancers and the
limited expression of dysadherin in normal cells,
dysadherin could potentially serve as an additional
adverse prognostic marker for thyroid cancers. However,
dysadherin expression may need to be interpreted in
conjunction with other factors such as E-cadherin status,
another cell membrane protein associated with dysadherin
whose dysfunction lead to progression of benign tumor
to aggressive metastatic cancer [39]. In another study,
E-cadherin level was found to be lower than dysadherin
level in undifferentiated thyroid cancers but higher in
differentiated thyroid cancers [19]. Dysadherin seem
to downregulate E-cadherin, and the measurement of
E-cadherin expression can improve the prognostic power
of dysadherin expression [32]. Regarding the value of
using dysadherin expression as a prognostic marker,
differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancers perhaps
are best analyzed separately because of their different
behaviors, pathologies, and relative E-cadherin expression
which may affect metastatic potential and prognostic
utility [28, 38].
Dysadherin expression has another clinical utility
in that it is expressed predominantly on cancer cells
and almost never in normal cells, which makes it an
attractive target for targeted drug therapy including EDCs
[33]. EDCs offer a theoretical synergy of mechanically
combining the tumor-targeting properties of antibodies to
the potent cytotoxic effect of a linked molecule leading to
increased therapeutic potential while avoiding its harmful
effects on normal cells. In the present study we show that
no normal thyroid tissue express dysadherin and only 1 of
53 benign thyroid conditions (nodular goiter, Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis, and follicular adenoma) weakly expressed
dysadherin while majority of thyroid malignancies
showed moderate or strong expression. We also show that
dysadherin is overexpressed in the majority of aggressive
thyroid cell lines.
Using the overexpressed dysadherin on aggressive
thyroid cancers as a target, a new anti-thyroid cancer

therapy was created using the EDC technology. EDC1
is a novel conjugate composed of a novel inhibitor of
the Na,K-ATPase (CEN-106) conjugated to an antidysadherin antibody via a long non-cleavable linker.
While other Na,K-ATPase inhibitors such as digitoxin
have been used for the treatment of heart pathologies
for centuries, it was not until 1964 when researchers
discovered that a class of naturally occuring inhibitors of
the Na,K-ATPase known as cardiac glycosides were potent
anti-cancer drugs [40, 41]. This line of research eventually
lead to a series of Phase I clinical trials examining such
Na,K-ATPase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.
Unfortunately, these trials all failed to show significant
clinical benefit, most likely due to the fact that all cells
express the Na,K-ATPase. Therefore, to better target
the Na,K-ATPase inhibitory power of CEN-106, we
conjugated it to a targeting antibody. Our choice of the
EDC1 antibody stem from the discovery that dysadherin is
a subunit of the Na,K-ATPase [42, 43] and overexpressed
on metastatic cancer cells [37]. We have shown previously
that CEN-106 is active on numerous human cells with
EC50s between 1 and 5nM [33]. Conjugates where the
antibody bound to targets expressed on cells but not colocalized with the Na,K-ATPase were shown to have very
poor activity in vitro and in vivo on multiple cell lines.
Together, these two extracellular targets make EDC1 both
highly potent and highly specific.
Our cell proliferation assays demonstrate that in
sub-nanomolar concentrations, EDC1 shows selective
and dose dependent inhibition of thyroid cancer cell
growth when they express moderate to high levels of
dysadherin, leaving cells that do not express dysadherin
unharmed. Fortunately, EDC1 showed a very limited
cytotoxic effect against non-cancerous cells. The targeted
nature of EDCs may favor the use of drugs like EDC1
over more traditional cytotoxic therapies for aggressive
thyroid cancers. Interestingly FTC133 which has a
moderate expression of dysadherin did not respond to
ECD1. A possible explanation is that the level of both
the antibody target and the drug target affect the potency
of the antibody-drug conjugate. ECD1 is more potent
in cells where the expression of Na,K-ATPase is much
lower relative to dysadherin; the ratio of the two targets
needs to favor the antibody target [33]. We suspect that
the dysadherin expression is far less than that of Na,KATPase in FTC133.
Despite the above findings, this study does possess
some limitation. It is unknown whether the FV-PTC
samples in our study are truly FV-PTC or noninvasive
follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear
features (NIFTP) based on the new criteria published
on August of 2016 [44]. As the tissue microarrays were
constructed retrospectively, we were unable to assess all
the criteria to classify some FV-PTC as NIFTP. In some
cases, the entire capsule was not submitted for microscopic
examination which precludes the assessment of capsular
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

invasion. Additionally, in several cases the tumors were
encapsulated, but there were multiple tumors present in the
same lobe including papillary thyroid microcarcinomas.
While the percentage of dysadherin positive FV-PTC
and PTC were similar in our study, future studies should
classify FV-PTC according to the new criteria.
While we have demonstrated that EDC1 is cytotoxic
to thyroid cancer cells in subnanomolar concentrations,
another limitation is the lack of data on EDC1’s toxicity
in vivo since many cardiac glycosides failed clinical
trials due to side effects as mentioned earlier. We have
previously demonstrated limited drug toxicity in small
animals [33]. However, given that mice used in human
xenograft studies are immunocompromised and that CEN106 kill cells by a process resembling necrosis that induce
the immune system, we are working on advanced in vivo
models to better understand the true efficacious activity of
these EDCs. Additionally, we are in the processes to test
drug toxicities in primates.
In summary, dysadherin is expressed in aggressive
thyroid cancers, especially anaplastic thyroid cancers,
and its expression is associated with poor prognosis.
Additionally, conjugation of anti-dysadherin monoclonal
antibodies to novel and potent cytotoxic Na,K-ATPase
inhibitors presents an innovative targeting modality for
highly effective and safe anticancer agents. Therefore,
EDC1 warrants further investigation for treating patients
with aggressive thyroid cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board. Patients diagnosed with follicular thyroid carcinoma
(FTC), papillary thyroid carcinoma – both the classical
(PTC) and the follicular variant (FV-PTC) – and anaplastic
thyroid carcinoma (ATC) were identified using a surgical
pathology database in UW Hospital, Madison, WI, USA.
The hematoxylin and eosin-stained histological slides were
reviewed to confirm the initial diagnosis by the attending
pathologists at the time of the surgery. The clinical
pathologic data from the patients with thyroid cancer were
obtained, which included the age at diagnosis, gender,
primary surgery type, evidence of metastasis, evidence
of recurrence, and the date of last follow-up or death. The
information on tumor size, multifocality, extrathyroidal
invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and lymph node
metastasis was obtained from the surgical pathology
reports. The tumors were classified according guidelines
published by the American Thyroid Association [45].
All patients received post-operative evaluation
using a combination of radioactive iodine, thyroglobulin
levels, ultrasound, computed tomography, and fine
needle aspiration to detect persistence, distant metastasis,
and local recurrence. Persistence was defined as any

overnight at 4°C at half the dilution used for automated
immunostaining.
The following day the slides were washed and
incubated for 30 min with the ImmPRESS Universal
Peroxidase Reagent Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA) and developed with the ImmPACT DAB Kit (Vector
Laboratories) and Gills Hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories)
incubating each for 1 min.
Two independent observers (D.B. and R.V.L.)
scored the immunohistochemistry staining of the
thyroid cancer tissues using conventional bright field
microscopy. Differences in interpretation were reviewed
for consensus. The membranous staining for dysadherin
was interpreted based on the intensity as negative, weak
(1+), moderate (2+) and strong (3+). The pattern of
expression was considered restricted, focal, or diffuse if
the staining involved less than 2% of all the tumor cells in
the tissue microarray sample, 2-25%, and more than 25%
respectively.

Tissue microarray construction
The most representative areas of the formalinfixed paraffin-embedded thyroid tumors were organized
on a tissue microarray in triplicate 0.6mm cores using
manual tissue microarrayer (Beecher Instruments,
Sun Prarie, WI, USA) after the confirmation of the
thyroid cancer diagnosis. Normal thyroid controls were
obtained from tissues incidentally removed from patients
undergoing surgery for hyperparathyroidism or from the
histologically normal thyroid tissues on the opposite lobe
of the malignancy. Thyroid tissues involved in follicular
adenoma, nodular goiter, and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
were collected for benign thyroid disease control. Sections
of 5μm were cut for immunohistochemical analysis.
Hematoxylin and eosin stain was used to confirm the
placement of the tissue cores on the recipient block of the
microarray.

Cells and reagents
Human derived thyroid cancer cells TPC-1
(papillary), BCPAP (papillary), FTC133 (follicular),
FTC236 (follicular), HTh7 (anaplastic), and 8505C
(anaplastic) were used. All six cell lines were authenticated
and confirmed with their unique identify by DNA profiling
[46]. TPC-1 (provided by Dr. Daniel Ruan, Brigham and
Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA), HTh7 (provided by
Dr. Rebecca Schweppe, University of Colorado, Denver,
CO) and 8505C (Dr. Daniel Ruan) were maintained in
RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. FTC133 and
FTC236 were purchased from European Collection of Cell
Cultures (ECACC) and maintained in DMEM/Ham’s F-12
medium (1:1; Invitrogen) with 10% FBS, 5mg/500mL
insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 5u/500ml thyrotrophic hormone
from bovine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. UAEC,
UVEC, and REC cell lines were grown in Endothelial Cell
Growth Medium 2 and Renal Epithelial Growth Medium
2 (PromoCell GmbH). All cell lines were grown in 5%
CO2 at 37°C.

Immunohistochemistry
Automated immunostaining was done by first
deparaffinizing the previously mentioned 5μm thick tissue
microarray sections followed by heat-induced epitope
retrieval using Lab Vision PT module (Thermo Scientific)
with Lab Vision citrate buffer pH 6.0. Immunolabeling
was done at room temperature using the Lab Vision 360
LV-1 Autostainer system (Thermo Scientific). All reagents
were obtained from Biocare Medical, Chicago IL, USA.
Nonspecific protein binding was blocked by Sniper and
nonspecific avidin was blocked using the Avidin-Biotin kit,
incubating 15min for each reagent. NCC-M53 (antibody to
dysadherin) was kindly provided by Dr. Setsuo Hirohashi
(National Cancer Center in Tokyo, Japan). The antibodies
were incubated for 60 min followed by incubation
with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG for 15 min and
subsequent 4plus Streptavidin–HRP treatment for 15 min.
BetazoidDiaminobenzidene and Mayer’s Hematoxylin
were each incubated for 1 min. Primary antibodies were
omitted in negative controls, which resulted in no staining.
For positive controls, thyroid tumors previously shown to
express the antigen of interest by immunohistochemistry
and by RT-PCR.
For manual immunostaining, full tissue sections of
the ATC were deparaffinized followed by microwave heatinduced epitope retrieval with 10mM citrate buffer pH 6
for 20 min. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 15 min followed by a nonspecific
protein block with a 2.5% normal horse serum for 30
min. The primary antibodies to dysadherin was incubated

Immunofluorescence
The six cell lines previously mentioned were plated
on 8-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) in RPMI medium
containing 10% FBS. The cells were then rinsed and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature.
After permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes
at 4ºC and blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin and
3% donkey serum in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature,
the cells were incubated with dysadherinmAb NCC-M53
antibodies, diluted 1:1000, overnight at 4°C. Antigens were

visualized using Alexa-488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse
and Alexa-555–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:300, 30
minutes) secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Nuclear staining
was conducted with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were
acquired with a Nikon Eclipse E800 upright microscope
and attached RetigaEXi CCD digital camera. Images were
processed and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.

The data obtained from patient medical records was
analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS for Windows, version 17.0; Chicago, IL). Unless
specifically noted, continuous data were presented as mean
± SEM. Student t-test (two-sided) and One-way ANOVA
were used to evaluate differences between two groups and
among multiple groups, respectively. Tests of survival
equality were performed by the log-rank test. P <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Western blot
Total cellular proteins were isolated from all six
human thyroid cancer cell lines as previously described
[47]. Protein concentrations were quantified by BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Denatured proteins (20μg) from each sample were
resolved by gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad Laboratories)
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad Laboratories). Protein-bound membranes were
blocked in 5% nonfat milk solution and incubated with
dysadherinmAb NCC-M53 antibodies, diluted 1:1000,
overnight at 4°C. The next day, the nitrocellulose
membranes were washed and incubated for 1 hour at
room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA). Immunoreactive protein bands were detected by
Immunstar (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

and NIH T35 DK062709 Surgery Summer Research
Experience for Medical Students (SJ).

Cell proliferation assays and EC50 calculations
All human thyroid cancer cell lines were treated
with EDC1 (produced as described [33]) and/or
negative control (CEN-106 conjugated to a non-specific
antibody) in varying doses to examine its effect on cell
proliferation and to determine the half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (EC50) with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The cell
lines were plated in quadruplicates on 24-well plates and
incubated overnight to allow cell attachment. EDC1 was
added in fresh medium (0-8nM) and incubated for 72 hrs.
On the day of measurement, the treatment medium was
removed, phenol red-free medium containing 0.5 mg/mL
MTT was added to each well and incubated for 3 ½ hours
at 37°C. The MTT formazan crystals were dissolved by
adding DMSO into each well and the absorbance was
measured at 540nm in a spectrophotometer (μQuant;
Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). The Cell Titer-Glo
assays (Promega) were done in non-cancer cell lines in
a similar manner. The Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell
Viability Assay was performed 72 hrs after treatment.
Wallac Victor2 Model 1420-041 assay plate reader (Perkin
Elmer, Gaithersburg, MD) was used for luminescence
measurements. The EC50 values were calculated using
GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad).
