ABSTRACT
Nodal is highly expressed in various human malignancies, thus supporting the
rationale for exploring Nodal as a therapeutic target. Here, we describe the effects
of a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb), 3D1, raised against human Nodal. In vitro
treatment of C8161 human melanoma cells with 3D1 mAb shows reductions in
anchorage-independent growth and vasculogenic network formation. 3D1 treated
cells also show decreases of Nodal and downstream signaling molecules, P-Smad2
and P-ERK and of P-H3 and CyclinB1, with an increase in p27. Similar effects were
previously reported in human breast cancer cells where Nodal expression was
generally down-regulated; following 3D1 mAb treatment, both Nodal and P-H3 levels
are reduced. Noteworthy is the reduced growth of human melanoma xenografts in
Nude mice treated with 3D1 mAb, where immunostaining of representative tumor
sections show diminished P-Smad2 expression. Similar effects both in vitro and in
vivo were observed in 3D1 treated A375SM melanoma cells harboring the active
BRAF(V600E) mutation compared to treatments with IgG control or a BRAF inhibitor,
dabrafenib. Finally, we describe a 3D1-based ELISA for the detection of Nodal in
serum samples from cancer patients. These data suggest the potential of 3D1 mAb
for selecting and targeting Nodal expressing cancers.

INTRODUCTION

1970’s, dacarbazine (DTIC) has been the reference drug
for patients with metastatic melanoma [2]. Despite the
questionable survival benefit of DTIC therapy compared to
supportive care [3], this drug is still listed as a therapeutic
option for advanced stage or metastatic melanoma [4].

Melanoma is the most aggressive and deadly form
of skin cancer with a median overall survival for advanced
stage metastatic disease of less than 6 months [1]. Since the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

For decades no new therapeutic agent has been approved
for metastatic melanoma by the FDA until a recent study,
which showed survival benefit of a monoclonal antibody
targeting a regulatory checkpoint, CTLA-4, in T-cells [5]
and led to the approval of ipilimumab in 2011. A series
of subsequent breakthroughs in targeted therapy also led
to the approval of agents targeting BRAF (vemurafenib
and dabrafenib) [6, 7] in patients harboring active BRAF
V600 mutations in melanoma and of those targeting
MEK (trametinib) [8], as well as the programmed death 1
pathway (PD-1) [9]. Enthusiasm, however, for the initial
increased objective response rates in patients treated with
these new targeting agents has diminished as follow-up
data are demonstrating progression of disease and the
inevitable development of resistance to these drugs. To
address the challenge of drug resistance, combinatory
approaches are under investigation and initial results are
showing some improvement in progression free survival
compared to monotherapy [10]; however, even with this
approach, reactivation of MAPK, for example, can lead
to early resistance [11]. Of special note are recent studies
showing that targeting both PD-1 and CTLA-4 together in
patients with metastatic melanoma resulted in higher rates
of objective response and significantly longer progressionfree survival than targeting CTLA-1 alone [12]. Continued
follow-up will determine if this anti-immune checkpoint
combinatorial approach will also lead to increased overall
survival.
It appears, therefore, that the selective pressure
exerted by the signaling pathway targeting agents can lead
to activation or overexpression of alternative signaling
events, all too common in melanoma, resulting in
resistance and disease progression [13, 14]. Efforts to fine
tune the clinical management of melanoma by determining
ideal combinatorial regimens and timing of therapies
will most likely lead to improvement in outcomes [15].
Nevertheless, the search for additional therapeutic targets
and relative inhibitory agents will undoubtedly enrich the
therapeutic armamentarium for melanoma by increasing
the available options for concomitant or sequential
targeting of pathways and growth factors as they become
biologically relevant in melanomagenesis and disease
progression [16].
Our studies have shown how Nodal, an embryonic
growth factor of the transforming growth factor-beta
(TGFB) superfamily, can play an important role in
aggressive human cancer, specifically underlying tumor
growth, metastasis and the cancer stem cell phenotype
[17]. Typically, Nodal signaling occurs via binding to
a receptor complex consisting of the EGF-like protein
Cripto-1 and type I (ALK4/7) and type II (ActRIIB)
activin-like kinase receptors [18]. This binding triggers
intracellular phosphorylation of the Smad2/3/4 complex,
which subsequently translocates to the nucleus, activating
the transcription of genes that include Nodal itself and the
Nodal antagonist, Lefty [18]. However, DNA methylation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the Lefty promoter in certain cancer cells including
melanoma has been shown to represent a possible
mechanism leading to unregulated Nodal expression and
signaling [19].
Our findings as well as others have shown
significant levels of Nodal expression in cancers of the
prostate, breast and ovary, melanoma and others (Table 1).
Since Nodal is not typically observed in most normal adult
tissues, it has the potential as an attractive prognostic and
predictive biomarker [20]. In fact, Nodal levels correlate
with advanced stage disease in breast and prostate cancer
and melanoma [21-23]. Studies have shown the feasibility
of targeting Nodal in vitro and in vivo using either a
polyclonal anti-Nodal antibody or shRNA approach,
resulting in significant reduction in tumor cell activity
and tumor volume [24, 25]. In a recent combinatorial
study, we also describe the value of targeting Nodal in
cells previously treated with DTIC [26]. Specifically,
we showed that DTIC did not target the Nodal-positive
subpopulation among the viable cells resistant to treatment.
More importantly, we observed that tissue samples from
patients with melanomas refractory to DTIC therapy
showed positive immunostaining for Nodal, in both preand post-DTIC treated tumors. Also, in vitro experiments
showed that combining DTIC treatment with a polyclonal
anti-Nodal antibody decreased cell growth and increased
apoptosis synergistically, at concentrations incapable of
producing meaningful effects as monotherapy. Finally,
we demonstrated that Nodal expression is maintained and
targetable in BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive melanoma
cells surviving anti-BRAF treatment with vemurafenib.
Collectively, these observations strongly support ongoing
efforts to develop clinically feasible approaches for
targeting Nodal in melanoma as well as other aggressive
cancers.
Here, we describe the functional characterization
of a novel mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to
human Nodal, its biological effects on human tumor cells
both in vitro and in vivo, and its potential as a capture
antibody in an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent based
assay (ELISA) for the detection of Nodal in biological
samples. This is the first description of a Nodal functionblocking mAb that could be further developed for clinical
application.

RESULTS
Expression of Nodal in various human tissues
Our initial experiments tested a series of normal
human tissue extracts for Nodal expression by WB
analysis. Compared to Nodal detected in lysates from the
H9 human embryonic stem cell line (H9) used as control,
which is known to show robust expression of Nodal [23],

Generation and characterization of anti-Nodal
mAbs

we noted no appreciable Nodal protein expression in the
major organs of brain, kidney, liver, pancreas or heart
(Figure 1). A band with a similar molecular weight as that
detected in H9 and C8161 cell lysates but with appreciably
lower intensity was observed, however, in lysates from
one of two skeletal muscle samples tested. Especially
noteworthy are the findings from many laboratories
reporting Nodal reexpression in several different types of
human malignancies both in vitro and in vivo (Table 1).
These data suggest that Nodal may represent a promising
new therapeutic target specific to cancers.

Production and selection of anti-Nodal mAbs
3D1 production and generation has been previously
described [27]. 3D1 binds the original antigen hNodal
[44-67], whereas it recognizes less robustly the mutated
peptide variant hNodal [44-67] E49A-E50A (Figure 2A),
suggesting that it preferentially interacts with the two
glutamic residues involved in the binding with Cripto-1
and potentially has a neutralization activity for the Nodal/
Cripto-1 receptor complex interaction [28] .

Figure 1: Nodal expression in normal human tissue lysates. Commercially available Western blot grade normal human tissue
lysates were analyzed for Nodal expression. Lysates from H9 hESCs were used as positive control for Nodal in the first lane. Nodal is not
detected in lysates from normal human brain, kidney, liver, pancreas and heart. Low expression was detected in normal skeletal muscle
sample 1, but no expression was detected in normal skeletal muscle sample 2. Nodal is highly expressed in C8161 human metastatic
melanoma cells.

interaction between the 3D1 mAb and the protein.

The ability of 3D1 to bind rhNodal was assessed
by SPR by immobilizing the protein on Biacore sensor
chips and injecting the purified antibody at increasing
concentrations (Figure 2B). Association and dissociation
rate constants together with thermodynamic dissociation
constants (KD) were determined for each run and averaged.
A KD value of 1.42 nM was estimated in this way for the

Competition assays were performed using Biacore
sensor chips derivatized with rhCripto-1. For this test,
we first assessed the binding between immobilized
rhCripto-1 and rhNodal by injecting solutions of the
Nodal protein at increasing concentrations [28]. We

next incubated rhNodal at 5 nM with 3D1 mAb at
concentrations matching 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2 molar ratios
(protein:mAb). As shown in Figure 2C, the 3D1 mAb at
5 nM (1:2 molar ratio) inhibited the binding of Nodal to
Cripto-1 by approximately 70%. This is the first evidence
demonstrating the ability of 3D1 to block the interaction

decrease in anchorage independent growth) compared
to untreated cells and cells treated with IgG control
(Figure 3A). Nodal has been shown to underlie tumor cell
plasticity associated with a cancer stem cell phenotype
[29]. In particular, Nodal can induce phenotypic switching
whereby melanoma cells are capable of assuming an
endothelial-like phenotype via formation of capillary-like
structures in a process known as vasculogenic mimicry
(VM), which can be recapitulated in a three-dimensional
(3D) culture system for in vitro studies [30]. When C8161
cells were treated with 4mg/ml of either 3D1 mAb or
IgG control, and then grown in 3D cultures for 24 hours
to measure their ability to engage in VM, the 3D1 mAb
treated tumor cells were unable to form complete networks
characteristic of VM, as measured by the reduced number
of junctions and tubules using the AngioSys software
package, compared to control (Figure 3B).

Function-blocking effects of 3D1 mAb in vitro
To determine whether the 3D1 mAb had the potential
to affect C8161 melanoma tumor colony forming ability,
untreated cells, or cells treated with either IgG control or
3D1 mAb for 72 hours were cultured in soft agar for three
weeks (measuring anchorage independent growth). Cells
treated with 3D1 mAb demonstrated a reduced ability
to form non-adherent spheroidal clusters (signifying a

3D1 mAb effects on Nodal signaling and cell cycle
regulators

Breast cancer cells
Based on our previous findings showing downregulation of Nodal expression in human breast cancer
cells results in decreased CyclinB1 and increased p27
[25], we extended our analysis to include the treatment of
MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells with 3D1 mAb
for the same time period. These results show a noteworthy
reduction in Nodal expression as well as P-H3 by WB
(Supplementary Figure 1).
Taken together, these results indicate that 3D1
mAb treatment diminishes Nodal expression, as well as
downstream phosphorylation of Smad2 and ERK1/2, and
reduces Cyclin B1 while increasing p27 in melanoma cells
and that similar effects can be observed in breast cancer
cells.

Melanoma cells
Treatment of C8161 cells with 4µg/ml of 3D1 mAb
caused a reduction in phosphorylation of the Nodal related
signaling molecules, Smad2 and ERK1/2, that was evident
after 4 hrs and maintained through 72 hrs duration of the
experiment (Figure 4A). Also, after 72 hrs of 3D1 mAb
treatment, there was an associated reduction in Nodal
expression (Figure 4B). Cyclin B1, a regulatory protein
involved in mitosis and highly expressed in actively
proliferating cells, was also reduced in C8161 cells treated
with 3D1 mAb for 72 hrs (Figure 4B). Concomitantly,
increases in p27, a cell cycle inhibitor protein that causes
cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and the mitosis specific
proliferation marker phospho-Histone H3 (P-H3) were
observed in the same 3D1 treated C8161 cells versus
control (Figure 4B).

Effect of 3D1 mAb in vivo
The inhibitory effects of 3D1 mAb described
thus far in vitro led to the investigation of potential
anti-tumor effects in vivo. To this end, several different
xenograft models were established in Nude mice. First, an

orthotopic model of cutaneous melanoma was established
by injecting C8161 cells subcutaneously. Once appreciable
tumors were detected in the mice, we initiated treatment
with 3D1 mAb or control IgG via direct intratumoral
injection. From days 8 to 14 of the experiment tumor
volumes were significantly smaller in the 3D1 mAb
treated mice compared to the IgG treated controls (Figure
5A). Sections of representative tumors formed by C8161
cells in these mice were analyzed to determine the

effects of 3D1 mAb on Nodal signaling. IHC staining for
P-Smad2 in these sections showed a significant reduction
in the mean percentage (± SEM) of cells with strong
positive nuclear P-Smad2 staining in the 3D1 mAb treated
animals compared to the IgG treated control [IgG = 83%
± 8.2% (N = 4) versus 51.3% ± 3.3% (N = 4); P < 0.05]
(Figure 5B). Since metastatic melanoma represents the
most aggressive and clinically challenging form of the
disease, we established a relevant metastatic model in

model, we have previously shown that C8161 cells readily
colonize the lung within 7-10 days post-injection and that
it is possible to target these cells using a commercially
available polyclonal antibody against Nodal [24]. In the
current study, when Nude mice treated with IgG control

are compared to those treated with 3D1 mAb, a significant
reduction in the mean percentage (± SEM) of lung tissue
occupied by the C8161 colonies (lung tumor burden)
was observed (Figure 5C) [3D1 mAb = 25.8% ± 4.6%

lung colonies from 3D1 mAb and IgG treated mice were
processed for IHC staining to determine the effects on
Nodal related signaling. As with the subcutaneous tumors,
the sections of lung from 3D1 mAb treated Nude mice
showed significantly lower mean percentage (± SEM) of
cells with nuclear localization of P-Smad2 compared to
lung colonies in sections of the IgG control treated mice
[3D1 mAb = 39 ± 8.9 (N = 6) versus IgG control = 59.4 ±
9.9 (N = 6); P < 0.01] (Figure 5E). Additional staining in
these lung colony sections showed a significant decrease
in the 3D1 mAb treated Nude mice of the percentage (+/SEM) of cells staining for Cyclin B1 [3D1 mAb = 25.9%
± 9.4% (N = 6) versus IgG control = 38.8% ± 10.5% (N
= 6); P < 0.001], along with a significant increase in 3D1
treated Nude mice of the mean percentage (± SEM) of
cells staining for p27 [3D1 mAb = 39.5% ± 17% (N = 6)
versus IgG control = 21% ± 15.3% (N = 6); P < 0.001]
(Supplementary Figure 2).
Previously, we showed that Nodal expression in
melanoma cells harboring the active BRAF mutation
is unaffected when these cells are treated with a BRAF
inhibitor (BRAFi) [26]. Here, we show that when the
human melanoma cell line A375SM (containing the active
BRAF mutation) is treated with the BRAFi dabrafenib,
P-ERK1/2 is significantly reduced, as expected, but
Nodal expression is relatively unaffected (Supplementary
Figure 3A). However, Nodal expression is significantly
reduced in A375SM cells when treated with 3D1 mAb
(Supplementary Figure 3B). Furthermore, tumor volumes
of A375SM orthotopic xenografts formed in Nude mice
are significantly reduced in 3D1 mAb treated mice
compared to BRAFi treated or IgG control treated mice
(Figure 6A). IHC staining of P-Smad2 in representative
tissue sections from these treated animals (Figure 6B)
show a significant reduction of the mean percentage (±
SEM) of nuclear P-Smad2 in 3D1 treated mice compared
to mice treated with either the BRAFi or IgG control [3D1
= 28.1% ± 2.6% (N = 4); BRAFi = 68.7% ± 6.3% (N = 4);
IgG = 50.2% ± 7.3 (N = 4); P < 0.05]. Collectively, these
findings show the Nodal function-blocking activity and
tumor diminishing effect(s) of 3D1 mAb treatment in vivo.

biomarker. Using this ELISA, Nodal was detected in 15/23
(65%) serum samples. When the serum samples were
categorized based on the aggressiveness of the disease
(Figure 7B), a trend for higher Nodal levels was noted
in the invasive compared to noninvasive breast cancer
patient sera [median for invasive breast cancer = 6807
(range: 0 - 23467; N = 12) versus median for noninvasive
breast cancer = 3509 (range: 0 - 11541; N = 11)]. Thus,
these results show that Nodal can be detected in sera from
cancer patients with our novel 3D1 mAb based ELISA.

DISCUSSION
Within just a few years the outcomes for the
treatment of metastatic melanoma has evolved from
little to no difference compared to palliative care, to
substantially improved response rates and quality of
life of affected patients - thanks to the introduction of
novel targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors
[31]. Not all patients, however, are candidates for these
promising new drugs. Moreover, development of drug
resistance is often the culprit for failure of targeted
therapy, which justifies ongoing efforts to shed light on
the kinetics of in vivo resistance mechanisms. Molecular
heterogeneity and high rates of somatic base mutations in
melanoma can explain, at least in part, the selection of
drug resistant clones of those melanoma cells that can
ultimately lead to disease progression [32]. The cancer
stem cell theory also suggests that within this continuously
mutating heterogeneous tumor population reside subsets of
cancer cells with stem cell-like characteristics that include
drug resistance, and which have the potential for disease
relapse and metastatic spread. In fact, growth factors and
cell signaling events characteristic of stem cells have been
shown to reemerge in some of these more stem cell-like
cancer cells [33]. For instance, Nodal, a TGFB member,
is predominantly expressed during early embryonic
development and plays an important role in embryonic
stem cell maintenance and during body axis establishment
[18, 34]. Importantly, Nodal is not typically observed in
most normal adult tissues (Figure 1). However, in this
study a band corresponding to Nodal molecular weight
was detected by WB in one of two skeletal muscle tissue
lysates purchased from a commercial source. Since no
information, other than the qualification of “normal
tissue” was available from the vendor regarding clinical
information or the context in which these samples were
obtained, given the soluble nature of Nodal, one could
speculate that Nodal, in this particular tissue sample,
may have derived from an adjacent cancer tissue. Further
investigation of Nodal expression in a third normal skeletal
muscle tissue by IHC did not reveal any Nodal expression
(Supplementary Figure 4). Nevertheless, Nodal is certainly
reactivated in various types of advanced-stage cancers like
metastatic melanoma and breast cancer, as well as others
(Table 1). It is not known whether Nodal can play a role

ELISA detection of soluble Nodal
Since our previous study showed Nodal expression
in tissue samples from a sizable cohort of breast cancer
patients [21], the Nodal ELISA was developed to
determine whether Nodal can be detected in serum
samples from breast cancer patients. A typical calibration
curve using a sandwich ELISA for detecting soluble
recombinant Nodal is depicted in Figure 7A. Initially,
conditioned medium from Nodal secreting H9 cells was
employed to test the validity of the assay in evaluating
secreted Nodal by ELISA. These findings supported a
viable approach that led to the testing of biological fluids
(i.e. serum) to identify secreted Nodal as a potential

cell aggressiveness in vitro and reduced tumor growth in
in vivo xenograft models [23-25, 29]. More recently, we
showed that the combination of a commonly used albeit
poorly effective, chemotherapeutic agent DTIC with
anti-Nodal antibodies results in synergistic decreased
cell growth and increased apoptosis, at concentrations
incapable of producing meaningful effects as monotherapy
[26]. Moreover, that same study showed that Nodal
expression was not affected in melanoma cells expressing
a BRAF mutation when treated with a BRAFi. Thus,
these observations suggest that a combinatorial approach
involving Nodal targeting may improve treatment in a
broader population of melanoma patients, regardless of
BRAF mutation status.

in conferring drug resistance in cancer cells, particularly
with respect to the newly developed targeted agents,
such as BRAFi. Indirect evidence, however, may support
efforts towards investigating this possibility. For instance,
EMT-like phenotype switching has been implicated in
the development of drug resistance, including resistance
to BRAF inhibitors [35], and Nodal has been shown to
promote cellular invasion and EMT-like phenomena via
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 [36]. In addition, the same
TGFB receptor signaling shown to mediate resistance to
the BRAFi vemurafenib [37] is employed for Nodal signal
transduction in melanoma [38].
Studies have shown that it is possible to target
Nodal in metastatic melanoma resulting in inhibition of

In this study, we describe the production and
functional validity of 3D1, a novel mAb capable of
targeting and functionally blocking human Nodal. We
show that 3D1 mAb is capable of robust binding of Nodal
and that it binds in proximity to the Cripto-1 co-receptor
interacting region encompassing Glu49 and Glu50 [39,
40]. The antibody also very efficiently blocks the in vitro
binding of Nodal to Cripto-1, thus suggesting it can prevent
the Cripto-1 co-receptor complex-dependent Nodal
downstream signaling. Melanoma cells treated in vitro
showed significant reduction of Nodal protein expression
levels and reduction of the activated (phosphorylated)
forms of SMAD2 and ERK1/2. This treatment was also
accompanied by reductions in anchorage independent
growth and vasculogenic mimicry, and decreased levels
of the cell proliferation-associated molecules Cyclin
B1 and P-H3, complemented by an increase of the
cell cycle inhibitor p27. Most noteworthy, Nude mice
xenograft models, both subcutaneous orthotopic and
lung colonization models, treated with 3D1 mAb showed
antitumor effects in terms of reduced tumor volume and
lung tumor burden, respectively. Equally important,
analysis of IHC staining for P-Smad2, p27 and Cyclin B1
in tumor sections confirmed the in vitro results. Also of
significance is the effect of 3D1 treatment of breast cancer
cells showing the down-regulation of Nodal expression
and the accompanying decrease in P-H3. These findings
validate key observations of a previous investigation
where shRNA knockdown of Nodal expression in MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-468 aggressive breast cancer cells
resulted in decreased CyclinB1 and upregulation of p27,
concomitant with decreased tumorigenicity [25]. These
data suggest that Nodal may represent a promising new
therapeutic target specific to cancers.
From a translational perspective, in addition to types
and rates of responses in patients for evaluating clinical
outcomes, it is desirable that therapies have specific
biomarkers for determining efficacy of treatment or
disease relapse. For instance, obtaining circulating tumor
cells from patients receiving targeting agents has been
proposed for monitoring the emergence of new mutations,
which in turn can be targeted with other available agents
in a sequential or combinatorial manner [13]. Increased
lymphocyte counts have also been suggested to serve as
a potential biomarker for positive response(s) in patients
treated with checkpoint inhibitors [41]. In this study, we
describe the first application of 3D1 mAb in developing
an ELISA based assay with the potential for detecting
Nodal in biologic fluids. Since Nodal is a secreted protein,
it is conceivable that patients with high Nodal expression
during advanced stage tumor progression may also have
detectable levels of circulating Nodal. In fact, here we
show for the first time that this novel 3D1 mAb based
Nodal sandwich ELISA is capable of detecting Nodal
in serum from breast cancer patients. Future studies
on a large cohort of serum samples from breast cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients at different stages of disease will be needed to
determine whether serum Nodal expression can be used
as a biomarker for staging in breast cancer or whether
serum Nodal levels are affected by specific therapies.
Nevertheless, we were able to determine from our
preliminary analysis of 23 serum samples that Nodal tends
to be expressed at higher levels in serum from patients
with invasive breast cancer. With respect to melanoma,
Nodal expression in melanoma tissue would not only
justify selection of patients for anti-Nodal therapy, but this
novel 3D1 mAb-based ELISA could provide the ability to
assess pre-therapeutic Nodal levels, important for dosing
and scheduling of the Nodal targeting agent for reasons
mentioned previously. More importantly, these levels can
provide a baseline for comparison with post-therapeutic
levels of circulating Nodal useful as a surrogate biomarker
indicative of a reduction of Nodal expressing melanoma
cells and efficacy of anti-Nodal therapy.
Our previous studies have shown that Nodal has
the potential as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in
several types of human cancers, i.e. patients with high
levels of Nodal expression have more aggressive disease,
and targeting Nodal in aggressive cancer cells leads to
reduced cell proliferation and tumor growth both in vitro
and in vivo [20, 21]. Here, we describe a novel Nodal
blocking mAb capable of anti-tumor effects demonstrated
in melanoma models both in vitro and in vivo. Since
Nodal is significantly expressed in melanoma and has
been shown to play an important role in its aggressive
behavior, this 3D1 mAb holds promise as a novel targeting
agent. Nodal expression appears to be independent of the
expression of currently targeted molecules and represents
a potential alternative or complementary target in noncandidate and candidate melanoma patients for these new
therapies. Future pre-clinical studies will determine the
optimal dosing schedule with or without sequential or
combinatorial associations with other targeting agents to
define the best therapeutic approach in aggressive cancers
expressing Nodal based on these new scientific findings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
TRIzol and restriction endonuclease enzymes were
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The
protein G column was purchased from GE Healthcare. SPR
analyses were performed on a Biacore 3000 instrument
from GE Healthcare, using CM5 sensor chips and certified
HBS buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2, P20,
0.005%). Recombinant human Nodal (rhNodal) and
human Cripto-1 (rhCripto-1) were from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). The following antibodies
were used for WB: rabbit anti-Nodal (H-110; Santa Cruz
34081

Oncotarget

Biotechnology, Dallas TX); rabbit anti-P-Smad2 (44244G; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY); rabbit antiSmad2/3 (07-408; Millipore, Lake Placid, NY); rabbit
anti-P-p44/42 MAPK (P-ERK1/2) (9101S; Cell Signaling,
Beverley, MA); rabbit anti-p44/24 MAPK (ERK1/2) (44654-G; Life Technologies); mouse anti-actin (MAB1501;
Millipore, Temecula, CA). The following antibodies were
used for immunohistochemistry: goat anti-human Nodal
antibody (LS-B3955; LifeSpan Biosciences, Seattle, WA)
1:150; rabbit anti-P-Smad2 (AB3849; Millipore) 1:100 1:250; anti-p27 (2552; Cell Signaling) 1:400; rabbit antiCyclinB1 (ab32053; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) 1:200.

µL) in HBS at increasing concentrations (6.0 nM - 100
nM). A 10 mM NaOH solution was used to regenerate
the chip surface. For competition assays, rhCripto-1 was
covalently immobilized at 5 µg/mL in 10 mM Sodium
Acetate buffer pH 4.5 at a flow rate of 5 µL/min onto a
CM5 sensor chip, reaching an immobilization level of 600
RU. rhNodal at 5 nM in HBS was incubated with 3D1 at
increasing concentrations, so to achieve Nodal:antibody
final molar ratios of 1.0:0.5, 1:1 and 1.0:2.0. Each mixture
was incubated for 30 min at room temperature before
passing on the sensor chip. 60 µL of each solution was
injected at a flow rate of 20 µL/min. On every biochip,
an underivatized surface was prepared and used as
control blank. All analyses were carried out at a flow rate
of 20 µL/min, injecting a constant volume of 60 µL of
antibody or competition solutions opportunely diluted in
the HBS running buffer at various concentrations. The
contact time was 3 minutes for the binding. Dissociations
were monitored for at least 3 additional minutes. For
every single analysis, experimental sensorgrams were
aligned, subtracted of blank signals and overlapped. All
mathematical manipulations and fitting were performed
using the BiaEvaluation software, vers. 4.1 from GE
Healthcare. All experimental data gave optimal fittings
when processed assuming a 1:1 Langmuir binding
interaction.

Generation and analytical characterization of 3D1
The 3D1 mAb antibody generation and production
have been previously described in detail [27]. Briefly,
the 3D1 antibody was generated against region 44-67
of human Nodal, which has been reported as potentially
involved in the Nodal-Cripto-1 interaction [39]. The
antigen contains two glutamic residues, E49 and E50,
crucially involved in the binding with the co-receptor
Cripto-1. To select anti-Nodal antibodies able to recognize
these two hot-spot residues, we screened clones using
both hNodal[44-67] and a mutated peptide, named
hNodal[44-67]E49A-E50A, in which E49 and E50 were
replaced with two alanines. In typical ELISA assays,
peptides were coated at 0.18 µg/mL (60 nM) and binding
was probed using the antibody at increasing concentrations
between 1.0 and 67 nM. Only antibodies binding the wild
type peptide were further developed and tested for binding
against the full length recombinant Nodal by both ELISA
and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The 3D1 antibody
was purified to homogeneity by two chromatographic
steps including protein G affinity chromatography and gel
filtration of bound fractions. The procedure for the binding
between 3D1 and peptides has also been previously
described in detail [27].

Cell lines
The C8161 human melanoma cell line used was
obtained from the University of Arizona, while the highly
metastatic A375SM human melanoma cell line, which
harbors the active BRAF(V600E) mutation [43], was a
kind gift from Dr. Menashe Bar-Eli, University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center. The breast cancer cell
line MDA-MB-231 was purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). Cell lines
were authenticated by short tandem repeat genotyping
at the Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago molecular
diagnostics core, routinely tested for mycoplasma
contamination with a PCR ELISA kit (Roche Applied
Science) and maintained as previously described [44-46].

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses
All SPR analyses were performed at 25 °C using
HBS as running buffer. Protein immobilization was carried
out following the canonical amine coupling chemistry
using the surface immobilization wizard procedure,
operating at 5 µL/min. Channels were activated with EDC/
NHS [N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N’-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride(EDC)/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide(NHS)
[42] for 7 min; for the binding assays, rhNodal,
appropriately diluted in the pre-selected sodium acetate
buffer pH 4.5, was coupled until a 4000 RU level
was achieved. Residual reactive groups on the sensor
chip surface were deactivated by addition of 1.0 M
ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. Antibody binding
was tested at 20 µL/min injecting solutions of 3D1 (60
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Anchorage independent growth assay
C8161 melanoma cells (5,000 cells/well) were
suspended in 0.35% agarose, RPMI 1640;10% serum
with of either 4µg/ml mouse IgG control (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or 3D1 mAb (2.8
µg/ml) and were then overlayed onto a solidified layer of
0.5% agar; RPMI 1640; 10% serum in 6-well dishes. Cell
clusters were allowed to form and were scored (50 cells or
larger clusters) after 3 weeks in culture. Triplicate wells
were averaged from separate experiments and presented
as a percentage (mean ± SEM) of IgG control.

Vasculogenic network formation assay

at low power (10X objective) in lungs from at least 4
separate mice for each group and performed by 2 different
observers. A final mean ± SEM was calculated from the
separate means determined by the individual observers.
A second experiment was carried out to determine
the in vivo effects of 3D1 mAb on primary melanoma.
To this end, 500,000 C8161 cells were injected
subcutaneously in Nude mice. Palpable tumors were
then injected directly with either 700 µg of total 3D1
mAb (N = 6) or IgG control (N = 4) antibody (alternate
day intratumoral injection of 100µg over 14 days). Mice
were then sacrificed and subcutaneous tumors harvested
and processed as previously described. To evaluate the
effect of 3D1 mAb in the presence of the BRAF(V600E)
mutation, a third orthotopic xenograft model was
established in Nude mice via subcutaneous injection
of approximately 150,000 A375SM human metastatic
melanoma cells. Mice were treated IP with 3D1 mAb or
IgG control, as described above, or 3mg/kg of dabrafenib.

Three-dimensional matrices were prepared by
spreading 75 µl of ice-cold Matrigel (average 12-15 mg/
ml; Corning, Bedford, MA) into 12-well culture dishes
and polymerized for one hour at 370C. C8161 human
melanoma cells (1 x105 cells/well) were then plated onto
the prepared Matrigel matrices in the presence of either
4µg/ml mouse IgG control or 3D1 mAb (2.8 µg/ml). No
additional antibody was added. Tubular network formation
was then observed after 24 hr and images captured
digitally using a Zeiss model 25 inverted microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Inc, Thornwood, NY) and Hitachi HV-C20
CCD camera (Hitachi Denshi Ltd., Woodbury, NY).
Mean values were calculated from images of at least four
different fields of both the IgG control and 3D1 mAb
treated cultures, and then analyzed using the AngioSys
software package (TCS CellWorks, Ltd., Buckingham,
UK) with the mean number (± SEM) of junctions and
tubules calculated from the analyzed fields.

Immunohistochemistry

Western blot analysis

Four micron thick, formalin fixed, paraffin
embedded tissue sections were prepared and
immunohistochemistry was carried out on a Dako Plus
autostainer (DAKO, Inc, Carpenteria, CA) as previously
described [23]. Briefly, following antigen retrieval and
blocking steps, sections were incubated in primary
antibody for 60 mins, followed by appropriate biotinylated
secondary antibody (Biocare Medical, Conrad, CA),
and then streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Thermo
Scientific Lab Vision). Color was developed with
3,3’-diaminobenzidine substrate (Thermo Scientific Lab
Vision) and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin
(Biocare Medical, LLC). As a negative control, adjacent
serial sections were incubated with species appropriate
irrelevant IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) at the
same concentration as primary antibodies. Similar to the
lung tumor burden evaluation described above, mean
percentage of positive staining ± SEM was determined by
2 different observers, each calculating the ratio of positive
cells/total number of cells X 100 for 4 separate high power
fields (63X objective) from at least 2 different mice per
group.

To determine the level of Nodal expression in brain,
kidney, liver, pancreas, heart and skeletal muscle ready
to use adult tissue extracts for Western blotting (WB)
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For WB
experiments of cell lines, whole cell lysates were prepared
and quantified as previously described [29]. SDS-PAGE
gel electrophoresis and WB were performed using standard
techniques. PVDF membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk or 5% BSA and antibodies diluted in either 5%
non-fat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin overnight at
4oC, depending on the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Signal was detected using West Pico chemiluminescence
reagent (Thermo Fisher) and exposure to x-ray film.

In vivo experiments
To evaluate the in vivo effects of 3D1 mAb,
a metastatic melanoma lung metastasis model was
established by injecting 250,000 C8161 cells intravenously
in Nude mice. After 4 days during which cells were
allowed to colonize the lungs, mice were separated
into treatment and control groups. The treatment group
received a total of 500µg of 3D1 mAb versus 500µg of
irrelevant isotype IgG in the control group administered
over 10 days (alternate day intraperitoneal injection (IP)
of 100µg of either 3D1 mAb or IgG). At the end of the
treatment period, mice were sacrificed and lungs harvested
and processed for histologic evaluation of lung tumor
burden and immunohistochemistry. Lung tumor burden
was determined by evaluating the mean percentage of
lung tissue occupied by C8161 in at least 4 separate fields
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Sandwich ELISA
By epitope mapping of commercially available
Nodal antibodies and 3D1 mAb, the latter was chosen
as the capture antibody for coating ELISA dishes, while
a rabbit monoclonal anti-Nodal (Abcam) served for
detecting the bound Nodal. The immune complex was
subsequently quantified using a horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit antibody in conjunction with
QuantaRed enhanced chemifluorescent horseradish

peroxidase substrate (ThermoFisher). The established
sandwich ELISA assay could detect Nodal as a
recombinant protein in conditioned media from human
embryonic stem cells and in biological fluids with a
detection limit (calculated using recombinant Nodal) of
75 pg/well. Human serum samples from breast cancer
patients were purchased from BioOptions (Brea, CA).
