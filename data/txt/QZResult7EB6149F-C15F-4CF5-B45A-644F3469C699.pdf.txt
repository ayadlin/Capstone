BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no consensus guidelines regarding the best therapeutic option for
patients with extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
type. METHODS: Patients with systemically untreated or de novo extranodal MALT lymphoma received rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 and fludarabine 25 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 through 5
(Days 1-3 in patients aged >70 years) every 4 weeks, for 4 to 6 cycles. After the first cycle, oral fludarabine
could be given orally at 40 mg/m2 on the same schedule. After 3 cycles, a workup was done. Patients who
achieved a complete remission (CR) received an additional cycle, and patients who achieved a partial
remission (PR) received a total of 6 cycles. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were studied, including 12
patients with gastric lymphoma and 10 patients with extragastric MALT lymphoma. Six patients (27%) had
stage IV disease. In total, 101 cycles were administered (median, 4 cycles per patients). After the third cycle,
13 patients (62%) achieved a CR, and 8 patients (38%) achieved a PR. Primary extragastric disease was an
adverse factor to achieve CR after 3 cycles of chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 23.3; 95% confidence interval,
2.0-273.3). At the end of treatment, the overall response rate was 100%, and 90% of patients achieved a
CR. The progression-free survival rate at 2 years in patients with gastric and extragastric MALT lymphoma
was 100% and 89%, respectively. Toxicities were mild and mainly were hematologic. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with rituximab and fludarabine is a very active treatment with favorable safety profile as

KEY WORDS: B cells, fludarabine, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, rituximab.

Mucosa -associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma1 represents 8% to 10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas.2,3 This type of lymphoma usually affects elderly
patients, and the clinical course is indolent, mainly involving the stomach, parotid or salivary glands, skin, lung,
and many other extranodal sites.4-6 Although the majority
of patients are diagnosed with localized disease, sometimes, advanced stages with multifocal involvement can
be observed.7
Early stage gastric MALT-type lymphomas associated with Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection are treated
first with specific antibiotic therapy against the bacilli,
and complete regression of the lymphoma is achieved in
up to 75% of patients.8-11 However, currently, there are
no widely accepted therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of patients with primary gastric MALT lymphomas
who have failed after antibiotics, patients with HP-negative lymphomas, patients with multifocal or disseminated
disease, and patients with primary extragastric MALT
lymphoma. Several therapeutic options are available for
treating these patients. Surgery has been abandoned in
recent years.12,13 Radiation therapy has been used either
as sole treatment or as an adjunct to surgery and had produced good control of the disease in patients who have
localized lymphoma.14,15
Several prospective studies have produced encouraging results with chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, 2-chorodeoxyadenosine (2CdA),
and combinations with fludarabine or other drugs.16-22
Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has
demonstrated activity in patients with recurrent/refractory
gastric MALT lymphoma who underwent anti-HP therapy or who were not eligible for anti-HP therapy.23-25
The combination of rituximab with chemotherapy
achieved better results that either option separately, similar to the results observed in follicular or diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma and without a significant addition of
toxicity.26,27 Recently, it was demonstrated that oral fludarabine phosphate is safe and effective for patients with
recurrent, indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.28-30

In addition, oral formulation is more convenient, because
it can be administered in an outpatient setting.31,32
Therefore, in the current article, we present our experience with rituximab plus fludarabine as first-line treatment in patients with chemotherapy-naive, extranodal
MALT lymphoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This multicenter, open-label, single-arm, nonrandomized
phase 2 trial was approved by the local investigational
review board. Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients before enrolment. The study was carried
out in 5 University Medical Centers in Spain.
Patient Eligibility
Eligible patients had to have histologically confirmed,
extranodal, marginal zone, B-cell, MALT-type lymphoma
with positive CD20 immunohistochemistry; an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2; age 18 years; adequate bone marrow,
hepatic, and renal function; and a life expectancy >3
months. Patients were ineligible if they had uncontrolled
infections, human immunodeficiency virus infection,
viral hepatitis, or immunosuppression; if they had
received previous chemotherapy for other tumors, if they
were pregnant or were breast feeding, if they had a history
of another malignancy within the past 5 years, if they had
psychiatric disorders, or if they had transformation to
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients with gastric
MALT lymphoma could enter into the study if they had
recurrent/refractory lymphoma after anti-HP therapy or
of they were not eligible for anti-HP because they had
HP-negative lymphoma. Patients also were required to
have symptomatic or progressive disease.
Previous Treatment
Eleven of 12 patients (92%) with MALT gastric lymphoma
had documented HP infection at diagnosis and received
5211

Original Article

eradication antibiotic therapy as their sole initial treatment.
All 3 patients with cutaneous MALT lymphoma had
received several types of local therapy, including surgical
removal, radiotherapy, topical corticosteroids, psoralene
plus ultraviolet A light treatment, or other treatments.
Chemotherapeutic Regimen
Patients received rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on
Day 1 and fludarabine 25 mg/m2 intravenously or 40 mg/
m2 orally daily on Days 1 through 5. In patients with gastric
lymphoma, the first cycle of fludarabine was given intravenously to guarantee drug absorption. In patients aged >70
years, fludarabine could be reduced to a total of 3 days
(Days 1-3). All treatments were given in an outpatient setting. The regimen was administered in 28-day cycles up to
a maximum of 6 cycles. After the third cycle, restaging was
performed. The patients who were in complete remission
(CR) received a fourth cycle of combined rituximab and fludarabine, and the patients who had a partial response
received a total of 6 cycles. Patients who had less than a partial response after the third cycle were excluded.
A subsequent cycle was administered if the absolute
neutrophil count (ANC) was >1  109/L and if the platelet count was >100  109/L. For patients who had an
ANC <1  109/L and/or platelets <50  109/L, the next
treatment cycle was delayed by 1 week until normal values
were achieved. A 20% reduction in the fludarabine dose
was recommended for the subsequent cycles. Treatment
was stopped if the delay in administering the subsequent
cycle exceeded 2 weeks. Prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole
was received according to the physician’s preference.
Granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor and antiviral prophylaxis were not considered routinely. Safety evaluation,
which consisted of a physical examination, full blood cell
counts, and routine chemical values, were measured
before each cycle.
Baseline and Outcome Assessments
All patients underwent a disease extension study that
included medical history, physical examination, and laboratory and x-ray studies before entry onto the study. These
tests included a complete blood count with differential; tests
for electrolytes, renal and liver parameters, lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, b2 microglobulin, and immunoglobulins;
a direct antiglobulin test; computed tomography scans of
5212

the chest, abdomen and pelvis; and a bone marrow biopsy.
In patients who had lymphoma restricted to the stomach,
upper endoscopy and upper ultrasound endoscopy were
performed.33 Additional radiologic studies were performed
according to the primary anatomic site of disease, such as
magnetic resonance imaging of the salivary glands or orbit.
Stage was determined according to the Lugano system.34
All patients were re-evaluated after the third cycle post-therapy, every 6 months during the first 2 years, and annually
thereafter. Procedures included computed tomography
scans and upper endoscopy with multiple biopsies in
patients with gastric lymphoma.
All patients who received at least 1 cycle of therapy
were considered assessable for response and for toxicity.
Response was classified according to the definitions recommended by the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphomas.35 In
gastric lymphomas, histologic responses were defined
according to the criteria of Copie-Berman et al for the
posttreatment evaluation of MALT lymphoma.36 Toxic
effects were evaluated throughout treatment using the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria
version 3.0.37
The t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation was analyzed
on diagnostic pretreatment specimens using fluorescent in
situ hybridization with the commercially available breakapart locus-specific identifier/MALT1 (LSI-MALT1)
probe (Vysis, Downers Grove, Ill) or by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for the
apoptosis-inhibitor 2/MALT1 (API2/MALT1) fusion
product, as described previously.38

Statistical Analysis
Univariate analysis for response after 3 cycles of combined
rituximab and fludarabine was performed through logistic
regression analysis. The actuarial probability of survival
was calculated with survival tables using SPSS software
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill).

45% of patients were men. The baseline characteristics of
all 22 eligible patients are summarized in Table 1. It is
noteworthy that 12 patients (55%) had primary gastric
involvement, including 8 with stage I1 disease and 4
patients with stage II1 disease according to the Lugano
classification system. Three of 12 patients who had gastric
involvement had t(11;18)(q21;q21).

Response and Survival Data
The number of cycles of chemotherapy was <4 cycles in 2
patients (10%), 4 cycles in 12 patients (54%), and 6 cycles
in 8 patients (36%).
Response evaluation was feasible in 21 patients,
because 1 patient with gastric lymphoma refused her consent after 3 cycles. After the third cycle, 13 patients (62%)
achieved a CR, and 8 patients (38%) achieved a partial
remission; thus, an objective response was obtained in all
patients. At the end of therapy, 19 patients (90%) had
achieved a CR, and 2 patients (10%) had achieved a partial remission; thus, an objective response was obtained in

100% of patients. Univariate analysis identified primary
nongastric disease as an adverse factor to reach CR after 3
cycles of combined rituximab and fludarabine (hazard ratio, 23.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-273.3). No
other variables were associated with response after 3 cycles
of combined chemotherapy. All 7 patients who had gastric
stage I1 tumors achieved a CR after 3 cycles compared
with 3 of 4 patients (75%) who had stage II1 disease,
although the differences were not significant (P ¼ .165).
In patients who had extragastric disease, no differences in
the CR rates after 3 cycles of chemotherapy was observed:
1 of 4 patients (25%) and in 2 of 6 patients (33%) who
had stage I and II cancer and stage III and IV cancer,
respectively (P ¼ .778). It is interesting to note that 2 of 3
patients (67%) who had primary cutaneous involvement
achieved a CR with 3 cycles of rituximab and fludarabine.
Complete and overall response rates did not differ significantly between patients with gastric lymphoma and
patients with nongastric lymphoma at the end of treatment (Table 2). In addition, the 3 patients who had a
t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation achieved CR after 3
cycles (2 patients) and 6 cycles (1 patient).
The median follow-up was 23 months (95% CI,
18-27 months). Two patients with parotid gland and submaxillary gland involvement at diagnosis developed recurrent disease relapsed at 6 months and 18 months. One
patient received further treatment with immunochemotherapy and was free of disease at the last follow-up. The
second patients did not receive treatment, and she had stable disease at the last follow-up. The progression-free survival (PFS) rate for the entire series at 24 months was 88%

(95% CI, 80%-100%). PFS at 24 months in patients with
gastric and nongastric MALT lymphoma were 100% and
79%, respectively. All patients were alive at the last follow-up. Therefore, the actuarial overall survival (OS) rate
at 24 months was 100%.

Toxicity
In total, 101 cycles of combined rituximab and fludarabine were given to the 22 patients (median, 4 cycles per
patient; range, 2-6 cycles per patient). Oral fludarabine
was administered in 65 cycles. Toxicities generally were
mild and mainly were hematologic. Overall, 9 patients
(41%) had any grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity (Table
3), and 3 patients (14%) patients had any nonhematologic toxicity (Table 4). Grade 1 nausea was reported in 2
patients, both of whom were receiving intravenous fludarabine. Standard infusion-related reactions during the first
infusion of rituximab occurred. Prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole was received by 16 of 22 patients (73%). No
episodes of febrile neutropenia leading to hospitalization
occurred. Only 1 patient had to be admitted because of
grade 3 diarrhea without neutropenia or fever, and a lower
intestinal endoscopy in that patient revealed diverticulitis.
One patient had an episode of herpes zoster 2 months
after concluding therapy. No cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia developed. Treatment was discontinued in
only 1 patient who had an episode of grade 4 neutropenia;
she recovered despite the neutropenia and was in good
health, and she received no further treatment because of
her advanced age and her status of CR after 2 cycles of
chemotherapy. Two patients had prolonged, mild thrombocytopenia after finishing the treatment, and 1 patient
had prolonged, mild neutropenia. Bone marrow aspirates
revealed no signs of myelodysplasia, and cytogenetic studies were normal. Compared with mean pretreatment lym5214

phocyte levels (1.97  109/L; 95% CI, 1.51-2.45  109/
L), marked decreases in total lymphocyte counts were
observed at the end of rituximab and fludarabine therapy
(0.76  109/L; 95% CI, 0.56-0.96  109/L), at 6 months
(1.07  109/L; 95% CI, 0.92-1.22  109/L), at 12
months (1.33  109/L; 95% CI, 1.11-1.54  109/L), and
at 18 months (1.4  109/L; 95% CI, 1.16-1.69  109/L).
Quantitative serum immunoglobulin levels were stable in
12 of 14 patients who had sequential samples taken over
time. In 3 patients, therapy was given from Day 1 to Day
3 in the first cycle because of advanced age. Two other
patients had reductions in the planned dose because of hematologic toxicity after the second and third cycles of
treatment.

DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in combination with fludarabine can be
administered safely in chemotherapy-naive patients who
have extranodal MALT lymphoma. This regimen yields
an overall response rate of 100% and a CR rate of 90%.
To our knowledge, the current study represents the first
evidence of clinical activity of immunochemotherapy
with rituximab in combination with fludarabine in this
type of lymphomas. Although a profound change in therapeutic approaches to MALT lymphoma has occurred in
recent years, data on chemotherapy are still scarce in the
literature, and only 3 prospective series have been published. Hammel et al reported a 75% CR rate in 24
patients who had MALT lymphoma.18 Those patients,
who had predominantly gastric involvement, were
received treatment with either oral chlorambucil or
Cancer

cyclophosphamide administered on a daily basis for 12
months to 24 months. The event-free survival rate at 5
years was 50% in that study. Jager et al reported an 84%
CR rate in 26 patients who received systemic treatment
with the nucleoside analogue 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine
(2CdA) administered for 4 to 6 cycles.19 However, striking differences were observed in the CR rate between
patients with gastric and extragastric disease (100% vs
43%, respectively). More recently, rituximab was reported
as a promising agent against MALT lymphoma.23 In that
study, which included 27 patients with gastric MALT, 12
patients achieved a CR, and 8 patients had a partial
response (overall objective response rate, 77%). It is noteworthy that none of the 4 patients in that study who had
stage IV disease achieved CR. In our experience, rituximab and fludarabine produce a higher CR rate, and
patients reach this status in less than 3 months, a time
frame similar to that observed with 2CdA19 or rituximab23 (2 months and 2.3 months, respectively) and faster
than that observed with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide18 (9 months in patients with localized disease and
15 months in patients with advanced disease). In addition,
our results produced a longer PFS compared with these
schemas. However, longer follow-up will be necessary to
determine whether this benefit will translate into a longer
OS, as in the case of other lymphoid entities such follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Two situations merit special consideration. First, all
of our patients who had skin involvement maintained their
CR status although they all had numerous recurrences after
they received several lines of local therapies. Second, our 3
patients who had gastric lymphoma and t(11;18)(q21;q21)
translocation achieved CR, and neither developed recurrent
disease. Therefore, contrary to the negative impact of this
translocation for lymphoma regression after eradication
therapy or alkylating agents, t(11;18)(q21;q21) does not
appear to affect outcomes when immunochemotherapy
with rituximab and fludarabine is administered to patients
with gastric MALT lymphoma. These results are in concordance with those reported by Streubel et al.39 with
2CdA and by Conconi et al.25 with rituximab and with
our previous observations.38 Monitoring of minimal residual disease is ongoing.
Combined rituximab and fludarabine generally was
well tolerated, and many patients favored the oral formuCancer

lation. Infusion-related toxicity associated with rituximab
was in line with expectations. Toxicities were mainly hematologic. Rituximab causes profound and prolonged
depletion of B lymphocytes,40,41 and fludarabine causes
profound and prolonged depletion of T cells.28 Combining fludarabine and rituximab in CLL was associated with
excess neutropenia when administered in either a concurrent or sequential regimen. In contrast, grade 4 neutropenia in our study was lower than that reported in CLL40
and did not predispose patients to an excess number of
neutropenic fever episodes or life-threatening infections.
Infectious toxicity generally was mild, and only 1 patient
had to be admitted to hospital. Only a few patients
required treatment delays or dose modifications. It is
noteworthy that >66% of our patients received only 4
cycles of rituximab and fludarabine. The lowering of the
cumulative dose of fludarabine potentially may reduce the
hematopoietic stem cell damage or the risk of
myelodysplasia.
Some previous studies reported an increased risk of
opportunistic infections observed with fludarabine-based
therapies.42 Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci was
given to 73% of our patients, and we did not observe any
episodes of pneumocystis infection. Considering the profound lymphocytopenia observed with rituximab and fludarabine, routine prophylaxis against P. jiroveci seems to
be a safe and reasonable preventive measure in this setting,
at least during treatment and up to 6 months later. We
noted only 1 case of herpetic infection in our study. This
is in contrast to a higher number of herpes virus infections
in previously untreated patients with CLL who received
rituximab and fludarabine, suggesting that the regimen
produces a more profound, innate immunosuppression in
CLL.40 Two episodes of prolonged, mild thrombocytopenia and 1 episode of prolonged, mild neutropenia were
observed at the end of treatment. However, no evidence
of myelodysplasia has been observed in these patients to
date. In addition, the low rate of side effects also was
observed in elderly patients, and no apparent difference in
toxicities were reported between the 5 patients aged >70
years and the young patients in our study.
In conclusion, the current results indicate that
immunochemotherapy with combined rituximab and fludarabine achieves a high CR rate in both gastric and extragastric MALT lymphoma. Patients with gastric MALT
respond faster, and approximately 66% require only 4

cycles. This regimen is well tolerated, and granulocytopenia is the main adverse event. However, establishing the
long-term benefit of this therapy will require continued
follow-up examining both PFS and OS.
