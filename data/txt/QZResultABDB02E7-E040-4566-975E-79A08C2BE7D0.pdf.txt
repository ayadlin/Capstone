Abstract
Fatty acid synthase (FAS), the cellular enzyme that synthesizes
palmitate, is expressed at high levels in tumor cells and is vital
for their survival. Through the synthesis of palmitate, FAS
primarily drives the synthesis of phospholipids in tumor cells.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the FAS inhibitors
induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in tumor cells.
Treatment of tumor cells with FAS inhibitors induces robust
PERK-dependent phosphorylation of the translation initiation
factor eIF2A and concomitant inhibition of protein synthesis.
PERK-deficient transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts and
HT-29 colon carcinoma cells that express a dominant negative
PERK (#C-PERK) are hypersensitive to FAS inhibitor–induced
cell death. Pharmacologic inhibition of FAS also induces the
processing of X-box binding protein-1, indicating that the IRE1
arm of the ER stress response is activated when FAS is inhibited.
Induction of ER stress is further confirmed by the increased
expression of the ER stress–regulated genes CHOP, ATF4, and
GRP78. FAS inhibitor–induced ER stress is activated prior to
the detection of caspase 3 and PARP cleavage, primary
indicators of cell death, whereas orlistat-induced cell death is
rescued by coincubation with the global translation inhibitor
cycloheximide. Lastly, FAS inhibitors cooperate with the ER
stress inducer thapsigargin to enhance tumor cell killing. These
results provide the first evidence that FAS inhibitors induce
ER stress and establish an important mechanistic link between
FAS activity and ER function. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1262–9]

Introduction
Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a multifunctional enzyme that
catalyzes the terminal steps in the synthesis of the 16-carbon fatty
acid palmitate in cells (1, 2). In normal tissue, the FAS expression
levels are relatively low because fatty acid is generally supplied
by dietary fatty acids. On the other hand, FAS is expressed at
significantly higher levels in many tumors including those of the
prostate, breast, colon, ovary, and others (3–5). This expression
profile suggests that tumors require higher levels of fatty acids than
can be supplied from the circulation. Several reports have shown
that FAS expression levels correlate with tumor progression,
aggressiveness, and metastasis (5–7). In fact, FAS expression levels

are predictive of the progression from organ-confined prostate
cancer to metastatic prostate cancer (6), indicating that FAS
provides a metabolic advantage to tumor cells. Because of the
strong link between FAS expression and cancer, FAS has become an
attractive target for therapeutic intervention.
The functional connection between FAS and tumor progression
has been provided by the discovery and design of small molecule
drugs that inhibit the catalytic activity of FAS (8, 9). Cerulenin and
C75, which target the keto-acyl synthase domain of FAS, were the
first small molecules to be described as inhibitors of FAS activity
in human tumor cells. These pharmacologic agents inhibit FAS
activity and induce cell death in many tumor cell lines in vitro
(5, 7). The compounds are also effective at inhibiting the growth of
human tumor xenografts in vivo and have chemopreventive
abilities (10–12). We were the first to describe orlistat as an
inhibitor of the thioesterase domain of FAS (13). Orlistat inhibits
FAS activity and induces cell death in a variety of tumor cell lines
and is able to effectively inhibit the growth of prostate tumor
xenografts in mice (13–15). The data linking FAS function and
tumor cell survival emphasizes the relevance of FAS as an attractive
antitumor target. The importance of fatty acid synthesis in tumor
cells is further underscored by data demonstrating that pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of two upstream enzymes in the fatty
acid synthesis pathway, ATP citrate lyase and acetyl CoA
carboxylase, also induces cell death in tumor cell lines (16–18).
Because FAS is a target for therapeutic intervention, it is
important to fully understand the role of FAS in tumor cells as well
as the antitumor effects of FAS inhibitors. Given that the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major site for phospholipid
synthesis in cells, it is not surprising that previous studies have
identified a link between pathways that regulate lipid synthesis and
the ER stress response (19–21). Fatty acid synthesis in general, and
FAS activity in particular, drives phospholipid synthesis which
primarily occurs in the ER (22). Because of the direct connection
between FAS activity and phospholipid synthesis, we tested the
hypothesis that pharmacologic blockade of FAS activity might
induce ER stress in tumor cells (22). The data presented herein
shows for the first time that inhibition of FAS induces ER stress
specifically in a variety of tumor cells and not in normal cells.
Importantly, we also show that FAS inhibitors cooperate with a
known ER stress inducer, thapsigargin, to induce cell death. The
data also provide evidence that FAS inhibitors might be combined
with PERK inhibitors to more effectively treat cancer. The evidence
suggests that increased FAS expression in tumor cells is important
for ER function to maintain membrane biogenesis and suggests a
role for ER stress in the antitumor effects of FAS inhibitors.

Fatty Acid Synthase Inhibitors Induce ER Stress in Tumor Cells
Antibodies against eIF2a, phospho-eIF2a, cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved
PARP were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Antibody
against FAS was from BD Transduction Labs (San Diego, CA). Antibody
against h-tubulin was from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). TRIzol was from
Invitrogen. Avian myeloblastosis virus–reverse transcriptase and Taq
Polymerase were from Promega (Madison, WI). 35S-Methionine and 14Cacetate were purchased from GE Healthcare ( formerly Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), except for those designed for short
interfering RNA (siRNA), which were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette,
CO). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO),
Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), or Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA).
Cell culture and drug treatments. Prostate tumor cell lines were
maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at
37jC and 5% CO2. Wild-type and PERK / mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEF), obtained from David Ron (Skirball Institute of Biomolecular
Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY), HeLa
cervical cancer cells, and FS-4 human foreskin fibroblasts were maintained
in DMEM-high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HT-29
colon carcinoma cells were maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HT-29 cells expressing the pBabe-puro
empty vector or the pBabe-puro-DC-PERK construct were maintained with
1 Ag/mL of puromycin and supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum,
nonessential amino acids, and 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were treated for the
indicated times and drug concentrations as indicated. Orlistat was
extracted from capsules in ethanol as described previously and stored at
80jC (13). Further dilutions were made in DMSO.
Generation of #C-PERK–expressing cells. To generate human tumor
cells with deficient PERK signaling, HT-29 cells seeded in six-well plates
were transfected with 1 Ag of pBabe-puro or pBabe-puro-DC-PERK using
LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). These plasmids have been described previously (23). Stable populations of each construct were selected by incubating
transfected cells with 3 Ag/mL of puromycin for 48 h. The transfected cell
populations were then maintained in 1 Ag/mL of puromycin for subsequent
experiments in the medium described above.
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were harvested after the indicated treatments, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton
X-100 and a complete protease, kinase, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail.
Protein samples were electrophoresed through 7.5%, 10%, or 12% SDSpolyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, except for blots to
detect phospho-eIF2a and eIF2a, which were transferred to Immobilon-P
membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride). Immunoreactive bands were
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences,
Inc., Boston, MA).
Metabolic labeling of protein and fatty acid synthesis. To measure
fatty acid synthesis, 1  105 cells per well were seeded in 24-well plates.
Cells were treated with C75 (10 Ag/mL), orlistat (25, 50 Amol/L), or
cerulenin (5, 10 Ag/mL) for 2 h. 14C-Acetate (1 ACi) was added to each
well for 2 h. Cells were collected, washed, and lipids were extracted and
quantified as previously described (13). To measure new protein synthesis,
PC-3 cells were seeded in six-well plates. Orlistat (50 Amol/L) and
thapsigargin (1 Amol/L) were added for the indicated times. After
incubation with orlistat or thapsigargin, the cells were switched to
methionine-deficient medium although maintaining the drug concentrations. Methionine-deficient medium supplemented with 100 ACi/mL of 35Smethionine was added to the cells for 30 min to label newly synthesized
proteins. After the labeling period, cells were washed, lysed, and samples
were resolved by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.
The gel was then stained with Coomassie, dried, and the relative protein
synthesis of each sample was quantified after scanning with a Typhoon 9210
(Amersham) using ImageQuant software.
Clonogenic survival assays. Cells were plated in six-well plates at a low
density depending on the individual cell type. PC-3 cells were plated at a
density of 800 cells per well, except for the experiment combining C75 with
thapsigargin, for which PC-3 cells were plated at 3,000 cells per well. HT-29
and MEF cells were plated at a density of 400 cells per well. Human tumor
cells were plated 48 h prior to each experiment, whereas MEFs were plated

24 h prior to treatment. Fresh medium containing the indicated drugs was
added at the indicated concentrations for 12 to 20 h as indicated. The
medium was then removed, the wells were washed and fresh medium
was added. Plates were incubated until macroscopic colonies formed. To
visualize colonies, the wells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed
for 10 min with a 10% methanol/10% acetic acid solution. Colonies were
stained with a 0.4% crystal violet/20% methanol solution for 10 min. The
crystal violet solution was removed, the wells were washed with water to
remove excess dye, and dried at room temperature overnight. Colonies were
quantified by counting and by solubilization in 33% acetic acid followed by
spectrophotometric analysis at 540 nm. The survival of treated cells was
normalized relative to vehicle-treated cells and statistical significance was
determined by two-tailed Student’s t tests.
Detection of X-box binding protein-1 splicing and ATF4, GRP78,
CHOP, and GADD34 expression. Cells were exposed to the various drug
treatments or transfected with siRNA for the indicated times. Total RNA
was isolated from cells using TRIzol according to the manufacturer’s
directions. cDNA was generated from 2 Ag of total RNA using Avian
myeloblastosis virus–reverse transcriptase. X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1)
was amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase using the oligonucleotides
AAACAGAGTAGCAGCTCAGACTGC (sense) and TCCTTCTGGGTAGACCTCTGGGAG (antisense). The XBP-1 products were resolved on
2% Tris acetate-EDTA agarose gels and imaged on the Typhoon 9210 at
610 nm. The expression of CHOP, ATF4, GRP78, and GADD34 was determined by semiquantitative PCR using RNA collected as described above.
Multiple cycles were tested for each gene to determine the optimum cycles
in the linear range. The oligonucleotide sequences used were: CHOP,
CAGAACCAGCAGAGGTCACA and AGCTGTGCCACTTTCCTTTC; GRP78,
CTGGGTACATTTGATCTGACTGG and GCATCCTGGTGGCTTTCCAGCCATTC; ATF4, CTTACGTTGCCATGATCCCT and CTTCTGGCGGTACCTAGTGG; and GADD34, GTGGAAGCAGTAAAAGGAGCAG and
CAGCAACTCCCTCTTCCTCG. The CHOP, GRP78, and ATF4 products were
resolved on 1% Tris acetate-EDTA agarose gels and imaged on the Typhoon
9210 at 610 nm.
Suppression of FAS expression with siRNA. A paired siRNA
oligonucleotide against the FAS gene (FAS1 sense, GUAGGCCUUCCACUCCUAUU) and one siRNA against luciferase as a negative control (Luc sense,
CUUACGUGAUACUUCGAUU) were designed and synthesized by Dharmacon. The individual siRNAs (30 nmol/L) were transfected into cells upon
plating with siPORT NeoFX transfection reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Cells were collected at the
indicated times after transfection and then harvested for RNA to perform
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) or protein for immunoblot analysis.

Results
Pharmacologic inhibition of FAS induces phosphorylation
of eIF2A in tumor cells. Several studies have shown that lipid
composition is important for maintaining ER function (19–21,
24, 25). Other studies have shown that FAS drives phospholipid
synthesis in tumor cells (22). Because of this fact, we hypothesized
that FAS inhibitors might induce ER stress. One hallmark of ER
stress is the PERK-dependent phosphorylation of the translation
initiation factor eIF2a. We first examined the phosphorylation
status of eIF2a in cells treated with three different pharmacologic
inhibitors of FAS (Fig. 1A). PC-3 cells were treated with orlistat
(12.5–50 Amol/L, left) or cerulenin (5 or 10 Ag/mL, middle) for 16 h,
or C75 (10 Ag/mL) for 8 to 24 h (right). Each FAS inhibitor induced
robust phosphorylation of eIF2a at each concentration after 16 h of
treatment, as did thapsigargin (data not shown). Similarly, all three
inhibitors induced eIF2a phosphorylation regardless of tumor cell
type tested (data not shown). Likewise, fatty acid synthesis was
inhibited to similar degrees by each treatment, as measured by
14
C-acetate incorporation into total cellular lipids (Fig. 1B, left).
Because the phosphorylation of eIF2a leads to the inhibition of

Figure 1. FAS inhibitors induce
phosphorylation of eIF2a in tumor cells.
A, PC-3 cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of orlistat (left ) or cerulenin
(middle ) for 16 h, or C75 (10 Ag/mL) for 8 to
24 h (right ). Samples were resolved by
SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride and the membrane was probed with
antibodies specific for phospho-eIF2a, total
eIF2a, and h-tubulin. B, PC-3 cells were
treated for 2 h with C75 (10 Ag/mL), orlistat
(25 and 50 Amol/L), or cerulenin (5 and
10 Ag/mL), then incubated with 14C-acetate
(1 ACi) for 2 h. Cells were collected, washed,
and lipids were extracted and quantified
relative to vehicle-treated control (left ).
PC-3 cells were treated with orlistat (50 Amol/L)
for the indicated times or thapsigargin
(Tgn , 1 Amol/L) for 1 h and then pulsed with
10 ACi of 35S-methionine for 30 min. Protein
aliquots were then resolved by SDS-PAGE
and new protein synthesis was quantified by
scanning on a Typhoon 9210. Quantification
was relative to vehicle-treated controls (right ).
C, PC-3 cells were transfected with siRNA
against FAS or luciferase (Luc) for the
indicated times and analyzed by immunoblot.
D, FS-4 normal foreskin fibroblasts were
treated with orlistat (25 Amol/L) for 24 h or Tgn
(1 Amol/L) for 1 h side by side with PC3 cells
and prepared for immunoblot analysis.

protein synthesis, we did a 35S-methionine labeling experiment to
measure the levels of newly synthesized proteins in cells treated
with orlistat. PC-3 cells were treated with orlistat (50 Amol/L) for
12 and 24 h or thapsigargin (1 Amol/L) as a positive control for
1 h (Fig. 1B, right). Orlistat treatment reduced protein synthesis by
56% after 12 h and by 73% at 24 h, similar to treatment with
thapsigargin. Therefore, orlistat treatment is sufficient to induce
the phosphorylation of eIF2a and, subsequently, inhibit protein
synthesis. To further confirm our findings, a genetic approach was
also used to inhibit FAS expression. PC-3 cells were transfected
with FAS-specific siRNA or siRNA against luciferase as a negative
control. Immunoblot analysis showed a nearly 70% reduction of
FAS protein in the samples 48 h after transfection, which continued
through 72 h (Fig. 1C). Consistent with our findings using
pharmacologic inhibitors, the reduction of FAS expression levels
resulted in the detection of significant levels of phosphorylated
eIF2a at 72 h (Fig. 1C). Conversely, treatment of normal human
foreskin FS-4 fibroblasts with the FAS inhibitor orlistat did not
result in the phosphorylation of eIF2a (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these
data indicate that eIF2a phosphorylation induced by FAS
inhibition is, indeed, specific to both FAS and tumor cells.
PERK mediates eIF2A phosphorylation in response to
orlistat treatment. There are four known eIF2a kinases: PERK,
GCN2, PKR, and HRI; however, PERK is the kinase that
phosphorylates eIF2a during the ER stress response (26, 27). To
determine whether PERK is the kinase responsible for the
phosphorylation eIF2a in response to FAS inhibition, wild-type
and PERK / MEFs transformed with Ki-Ras V12 were obtained and
tested for their sensitivity to orlistat (27). The wild-type and

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

PERK / MEFs were treated with orlistat (12.5 Amol/L) for 8, 16,
and 24 h (Fig. 2A) or treated with thapsigargin (1 Amol/L) for
1 h (data not shown). In the wild-type MEFs, orlistat induced the
phosphorylation of eIF2a within 8 h (Fig. 2A), consistent with our
findings in prostate tumor cell lines (Fig. 1A). On the other hand,
no significant phosphorylation of eIF2a was evident during the
same time course of orlistat treatment in the PERK-deficient cells
(Fig. 2A). As expected, thapsigargin only induced phosphorylation
of eIF2a in the wild-type and not the PERK / MEFs (data not
shown). These data indicate that FAS inhibition results in PERKdependent phosphorylation of eIF2a.
It has been shown that PERK-deficient cells are hypersensitive to
ER stress–induced apoptosis (28). Because of this, we tested
whether PERK / MEFs were hypersensitive to orlistat-induced
cell death using clonogenic survival assays. Wild-type and PERK /
MEFs were treated with vehicle, orlistat (25 Amol/L), or thapsigargin (100 nmol/L) for 16 h (Fig. 2B). As expected, the PERK /
MEFs were hypersensitive to thapsigargin-induced cell death as
shown by a 3-fold decrease in clonogenic survival (P < 0.005).
Similarly, the PERK / MEFs showed hypersensitivity to orlistat
treatment, showing reduced clonogenic survival of wild-type–
transformed MEFs to 70% of vehicle-treated cells. On the other
hand, clonogenic survival was decreased nearly 4-fold to <20%
(P < 0.005) in the PERK / MEFs following orlistat treatment.
These data indicate that the inhibition of FAS activity induces ER
stress which is exacerbated by the loss of PERK.
To further support the results obtained in MEFs, we generated
stable populations of HT-29 colon carcinoma cells transfected with
a dominant negative PERK construct that lacks the kinase domain

(DC-PERK) or the corresponding empty vector (23). These cells
were seeded at a low density and treated with C75 (9 Ag/mL),
orlistat (25 Amol/L), or thapsigargin (10 nmol/L) to assess
clonogenic survival. As expected, the HT-29 DC-PERK cells were
hypersensitive to thapsigargin as shown by a nearly 3-fold
reduction in clonogenic survival (Fig. 2C, P < 0.005). Similarly,
the HT-29 DC-PERK cells were also hypersensitive to both orlistat
and C75 compared with the empty vector–transfected cells.
Clonogenic survival was reduced >2-fold in C75-treated cells and
nearly 4-fold in orlistat-treated cells (Fig. 2C, P < 0.005). These
results confirm that PERK function is important for an adaptive
response in tumor cells when FAS activity is inhibited.

Figure 3. FAS inhibitor treatment activates processing of XBP-1. A, PC-3
cells were treated with orlistat (50 Amol/L) for the indicated times or Tgn
(500 nmol/L) for 8 h. B, PC-3 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations
of cerulenin for 16 h or Tgn (500 nmol/L) for 8 h. C, HeLa cells were transfected
with siRNA against FAS or luciferase (Luc ) for the indicated times. D, PC-3
and FS-4 cells were treated with orlistat (50 Amol/L) for 16 h or Tgn (1 Amol/L)
for 1 h. Total RNA was collected and RT-PCR was done as described in
experimental procedures. XBP-1 is indicated by the 473 bp product and
XBP-1(s) is indicated by the 447 bp fragment.

Figure 2. PERK phosphorylates eIF2a in response to, and protects cells
against, orlistat treatment. A, wild-type (WT ) and PERK / MEFs transformed with
with Ki-Ras V12 were treated with orlistat (12.5 Amol/L) for the indicated times.
Samples were analyzed with antibodies specific for phospho-eIF2a and total
eIF2a. B, clonogenic survival assays were done in WT and PERK / MEFs,
treated with vehicle, orlistat (25 Amol/L), or Tgn (100 nmol/L) for 16 h, in triplicate.
The surviving fraction was normalized relative to vehicle-treated controls.

survival was normalized relative to vehicle-treated controls and statistical
significance was determined by two-tailed Student’s t tests.

Treatment with orlistat induces processing of XBP-1. In
addition to the PERK-regulated arm, the ER stress response can
also be mediated by IRE1, a kinase with endonuclease activity that
facilitates the splicing of XBP-1 mRNA to yield the splice variant
XBP-1(s) during ER stress (29). To determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of FAS also activates the IRE1 pathway, the status of
XBP-1 mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR using oligonucleotides
which flank the splice site in the XBP-1 mRNA. Total RNA was
collected from PC-3 cells treated with orlistat (50 Amol/L) for 8 to
24 h (Fig. 3A) or with cerulenin (5 or 10 Ag/mL) for 16 h (Fig. 3B).
Thapsigargin treatment resulted in a loss of the 473 bp product
associated with unspliced XBP-1 and the appearance of the
processed 447 bp form associated with XBP-1(s) that is produced
only in response to ER stress (Fig. 3A). Similarly, orlistat treatment
resulted in the appearance of the 447 bp XBP-1(s) product in as few
as 8 h with maximum processing by 16 h (Fig. 3A). Cerulenin also
induced the processing of XBP-1 (Fig. 3B). To further confirm the
role of FAS inhibition in the processing of XBP-1 to XBP-1(s), HeLa
cells were transfected with FAS-specific siRNA or siRNA against
luciferase as a negative control and collected for RT-PCR (Fig. 3C).
The 447 bp fragment that corresponds to the ER stress–specific
XBP-1(s) product was detected at 72 h in the FAS-specific siRNA
samples. Although PC-3 cells exhibit XBP-1 splicing after both
orlistat and thapsigargin treatment, FS-4 cells exhibited only minor
induction of XBP-1 and no splicing in response to orlistat (Fig. 3D).
These results suggest that the IRE1 pathway of the ER stress

response is activated in parallel to the PERK pathway when FAS is
inhibited in tumor cells.
Inhibition of FAS activity induces expression of ER stress–
regulated genes. Activation of the ER stress response induces the
expression of a number of genes associated with adaptation and
cell death, including CHOP, GRP78, and ATF4. CHOP has been
implicated in ER stress–dependent apoptosis and CHOP / cells
are mildly resistant to apoptosis following treatment with ERstressing agents (30). The mRNA expression of CHOP is induced in
DU145 cells treated with orlistat (50 Amol/L) or C75 (9 Ag/mL;
Fig. 4A). Similar effects were seen in PC-3 cells (data not shown).
CHOP mRNA expression was also induced following siRNAmediated knockdown of FAS expression in PC-3 cells (Fig. 4B).
Increased mRNA expression of CHOP may indicate that ER stress
could play a role in cell death induced by FAS inhibition (30). The
mRNA expression of GRP78, an ER stress–regulated chaperone, is
also induced in orlistat-treated cells (Fig. 4C; ref. 31). Furthermore,
mRNA expression of the transcription factor ATF4, which is
dependent on eIF2a phosphorylation, was also induced by orlistat
treatment (Fig. 4C). Collectively, the data in Figs. 1–4 show that FAS
inhibitors induce the ER stress response.
ER stress is an early event in cells treated with FAS
inhibitors. To determine whether phosphorylation of eIF2a and
subsequent indications of the ER stress response events coincide or
precede cell death induced by FAS inhibition, we analyzed the
temporal phosphorylation of eIF2a and markers of caspase activity
and cell death. In PC-3 cells treated with orlistat, phosphorylation
of eIF2a was evident at 16 h of treatment, whereas significant
cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP are not detectable until 24 and
48 h, respectively, consistent with previous reports (13). These data

semiquantitative RT-PCR was done with oligonucleotides specific for CHOP
(A and B ), GRP78 and ATF4 (C ), or h-actin (A–C ).

Figure 5. Phosphorylation of eIF2a is an early event in cells treated with FAS
inhibitors. A, PC-3 cells were treated with 50 Amol/L of orlistat for the indicated
times and samples were collected for immunoblot analysis and probed with
antibodies specific for phospho-eIF2a, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3, and
h-actin. B, PC-3 cells were treated with DMSO, cycloheximide (CHX, 1 Ag/mL),
orlistat (25 Amol/L), or orlistat with cycloheximide for 16 h. Clonogenic survival
was normalized relative to vehicle-treated controls. C, PC-3 cells were treated

of orlistat and cycloheximide for 16 h. Samples were collected for immunoblot

and h-tubulin.

indicate that the ER stress response is induced prior to caspase 3
activation and PARP cleavage. These data are further supported by
the timeline of XBP-1 processing following orlistat treatment
(Fig. 3A). Previous studies have shown that inhibition of protein
translation with cycloheximide can ameliorate the effects of ER
stress, likely by decreasing protein burden on the ER (28).
Clonogenic survival assays and immunoblot analysis were done
in PC-3 cells treated with vehicle control, cycloheximide (1 Ag/mL),
orlistat (25 Amol/L), or orlistat with cycloheximide (Fig. 5B and C).
Cycloheximide treatment rescued clonogenic survival of PC-3 cells
treated with orlistat (Fig. 5B), and also inhibited orlistat-induced
phosphorylation of eIF2a (Fig. 5C). These data are consistent with
previous reports on the protective effect of cycloheximide on cells
under ER stress and suggest that reduced protein burden on the ER
or reduced expression of a specific proapoptotic factor could be
responsible.
Cooperation between FAS inhibitors and thapsigargin. At
least one study has shown that ER stress can have a negative effect
on the activity of chemotherapeutic drugs (32). To determine the
effect of ER stress on FAS inhibitor–induced cell death, clonogenic
survival assays, immunoblot, and RT-PCR analysis were done on
tumor cells treated with orlistat or C75 in combination with the ER

Fatty Acid Synthase Inhibitors Induce ER Stress in Tumor Cells

cooperate with thapsigargin. A, PC-3 cells
were treated with DMSO, C75 (9 Ag/mL),
Tgn (25 nmol/L), or the combination of each for
12 h and clonogenic survival was normalized
relative to vehicle-treated controls (left ). Times
and doses of these various experiments were
selected to achieve minimal cell death from
single agents, so that the effect of the
combination would be most clear. PC-3 cells
were treated with DMSO, C75 (9 Ag/mL),
Tgn (25 nmol/L), or the combination of both
for 20 h and samples were subjected to
immunoblot analysis (top right ), or RNA was
collected and semiquantitative RT-PCR was
done using primers specific for GADD34 or
h-actin (bottom right ). B, HT-29 were treated
with DMSO, orlistat (25 Amol/L), Tgn
(25 nmol/L), or the combination of each for
12 h (left). Cells were treated with DMSO, C75
(9 Ag/mL), Tgn (25 nmol/L), or the combination
of each for 12 h (right ). Clonogenic survival

stressing agent, thapsigargin (Fig. 6A and B). Lower doses of FAS
inhibitors and thapsigargin were used to achieve reduced cell
killing by either single agent in order to maximize the effect of the
combination of the two drugs. PC-3 cells were seeded at a low
density and treated with C75 (9 Ag/mL), thapsigargin (25 nmol/L),
or the combination of both for 12 h and assayed for clonogenic
survival. The clonogenic survival of cells treated with the
combination of drugs was significantly reduced compared with
either agent alone (Fig. 6A, left). This coincides with immunoblot
data demonstrating that levels of cleaved PARP are highest in
lysates from cells treated with both drugs (Fig. 6A, top right).
Interestingly, whereas both C75 and thapsigargin induced the
phosphorylation of eIF2a separately, the level of phosphorylated
eIF2a was significantly reduced in cells treated with the two agents
combined, with no change in total eIF2a levels (Fig. 6A, top right).
This data suggests that the combined agents facilitated a more
rapid progression of the ER stress response and induction of the
GADD34 feedback loop (33). In support of this, mRNA expression
of GADD34 was increased in PC-3 cells treated with both agents,
as compared with either agent alone (Fig. 6A, bottom right).
Confirming that the effects of this combination of drugs are not
cell type–specific, clonogenic survival was assessed in HT-29

cells treated with one of two combinations: either (a) orlistat
(25 Amol/L), thapsigargin (25 nmol/L), or the combination of
both for 12 h (Fig. 6B, left); or (b) C75 (9 Ag/mL), thapsigargin
(25 nmol/L), or the combination of both for 12 h (Fig. 6B, right).
Although clonogenic survival only indicates an additive interaction,
these data, importantly, show that ER stress does not inhibit the
actions of FAS inhibitors and may actually enhance their efficacy.

Discussion
The ER stress response is a choreographed series of cellular
events activated by specific insults that result in altered ER
function (26, 34). The combined effect of this response is the
activation of genes that are specifically expressed to engage an
adaptation protocol. Upon prolonged stress, the adaptation mechanism of the ER stress response is saturated, thus, activating cell
death. Several studies have developed important connections
between lipid synthesis pathways and the ER stress response
(19–21, 35). Inhibition of phospholipid synthesis, especially that of
phosphatidylcholine, induces ER stress–related pathways (20).
Similarly, altering phospholipid metabolism by manipulation of
phospholipase activity amplifies the ER stress response in h-cells

(36). In addition, the accumulation of the GM1-ganglioside activates
the ER stress response in neurons, indicating that sphingolipid
levels are also important for regulating ER function (35). Recent
studies have shown that cholesterol-induced apoptosis in macrophages is triggered by ER stress induction, and small molecule
inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis activate the integrated stress
response (24, 25). There are also direct links between the individual
ER stress components and lipid synthesis pathways. For instance,
overexpression of the ER stress–specific XBP-1(s) expands ER
volume by increasing the activity of enzymes responsible for
phosphatidylcholine synthesis (19). Moreover, mice that are null for
XBP-1 have underdeveloped ER (37, 38). Collectively, these data
show that lipid and sterol levels are important for maintaining ER
function.
Because FAS inhibitors are being developed as antitumor agents,
it is important to understand the effects these drugs have on both
normal and tumor cells. The evidence here shows that FAS
inhibitors induce the ER stress response in a variety of tumor cells,
but not in normal cells. A model summarizing these data is
presented in Fig. 6C. Our results suggest that in a proliferating
tumor cell, FAS activity drives phospholipid synthesis, which
facilitates ER homeostasis and function. When FAS activity is
inhibited in tumor cells, the result is PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2a, a concomitant attenuation of protein synthesis
and the IRE1-mediated processing of XBP-1. Interestingly,
phosphorylation of eIF2a persists for as long as 48 h with no
attenuation (Fig. 5A), suggesting that protein phosphatase 1
activity is not activated or that GADD34 is not induced as is
evidenced by the lack of expression in Fig. 6A. Downstream of
PERK and IRE1 activation, inhibiting FAS activity also induces
mRNA expression of canonical markers of the ER stress response
pathway including CHOP, GRP78, and ATF4. The precise role of
these players has not been determined in cells that have been
treated with FAS inhibitors. However, it has previously been shown
that ATF4 acts to protect cells from ER-generated reactive oxygen
species (40). Another report showed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of FAS or acetyl CoA carboxylase in breast cancer cells results
in cell death that is mediated by reactive oxygen species and is
attenuated by supplementation with the antioxidant vitamin E,
which suggests that the ER stress response in general, and ATF4
expression specifically, may be a response to changes in the redox
status of FAS inhibitor–treated cells (18). These data are consistent
with the hypothesis that the ER stress response initially acts to
protect cells from FAS inhibitors, but do not rule out that ER stress
could also facilitate cell death after prolonged stress.
It is interesting to note that several indicators of ER stress,
including phosphorylation of eIF2a, inhibition of protein synthesis,
and XBP-1 processing are detected well before the canonical

hallmarks of apoptosis, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP. This
indicates that the ER may be an early sensor of fatty acid and
phospholipid levels in tumor cells. When the ER stress response is
unable to fully restore ER function perturbed by FAS inhibition,
it is possible that this could lead to the initiation of a cell death
program. Consistent with this notion, cycloheximide is able to
inhibit the orlistat-induced cell death and phosphorylation of
eIF2a. These data do not conflict with previous reports demonstrating that FAS inhibitors activate the intrinsic cell death
pathway and that ceramide accumulation contributes to FAS
inhibitor–induced cell death (34, 41). In fact, a previous study
showed that ceramide accumulation was also associated with
thapsigargin-induced ER stress and apoptosis (36). It is possible
that FAS inhibitor–induced ER stress may result in ceramide
accumulation which is important for cell death; however, the
relationship between FAS inhibition, ER stress, and subsequent
downstream events remain to be determined. Given the importance of phospholipid synthesis during S phase of the cell cycle,
showing that FAS inhibitors induce ER stress in tumor cells also
compliments a previous study which established that FAS
inhibitors induce apoptosis during S phase (42, 43). Collectively,
the data presented herein fill a critical gap in our understanding of
how endogenous fatty acid synthesis is required to maintain proper
ER integrity and function.
We have shown that inhibiting FAS activity in tumor cells induces
an ER stress response. Based on these findings, we propose that one
teleologic explanation for high FAS levels in tumors is to provide
support for a dynamic ER in rapidly proliferating cells. Furthermore,
we hypothesize that the ER acts as a sensor of FAS activity and
resulting phospholipid levels. In addition, we show that orlistat and
C75 cooperate with the ER stressing agent thapsigargin to enhance
cell death in vitro. Although thapsigargin is highly toxic and not a
likely candidate for tumor therapy, these data imply that tumor
microenvironment–induced ER stress will not hinder the efficacy of
FAS inhibitors (44). The data also suggests that FAS inhibitors might
be combined with PERK inhibitors to enhance tumor cell
cytotoxicity. In summary, these data provide the first evidence that
FAS inhibitors induce ER stress, which may explain some antitumor
effects of FAS inhibitors, and they also establish an important
mechanistic link between FAS and ER function in tumor cells.
