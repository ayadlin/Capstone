BACKGROUND: Targeting a single pathway in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) is unlikely to affect its natural history. We tested the
hypothesis that simulataneous targeting of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor receptor–1
(IGF-1R) pathways would significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) by abrogating reciprocal signaling that promote drug
resistance METHODS: This was a phase Ib/II study testing cixutumumab, combined with erlotinib and gemcitabine (G) in patients
with untreated metastatic PC. The control arm was erlotinib plus G. The primary end point was PFS. Eligibility included performance
status 0/1 and normal fasting blood glucose. Polymorphisms in genes involved in G metabolism and in the EGFR pathway were also
studied RESULTS: The phase I results (n 5 10) established the safety of cixutumumab 6 mg/kg/week intravenously, erlotinib 100 mg/
day orally, and G 1000 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. In the RP2 portion (116 eligible patients; median
age, 63), the median PFS and overall survival (OS) were 3.6 and 7.0 months, respectively, on the cixutumumab arm, and 3.6 and 6.7
months, respecively, on the control arm. Major grades 3 and 4 toxicities with cixutumumab and control were elevation of transaminases, 12% and 6%, respectively; fatigue, 16% and 12%, respectively; gastrointestinal, 35% and 28%, respectively; neutropenia, 21% and
10%, respectively; and thrombocytopenia, 16% and 7%, respecively. Grade 3/4 hyperglycemia was seen in 16% of patients on cixutumumab. Grade 3 or 4 skin toxicity was similar in both arms of the study (< 5%). No significant differences in PFS by genotype were seen
for any of the polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Adding the IGF-1R inhibitor cixutumumab to erlotinib and G did not lead to longer

INTRODUCTION
Survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) remains very poor because of the presence of metastatic disease
in the majority of patients at the time of diagnosis.1 Its marked resistance to conventional therapies characterizes the disease, and, unfortunately, a number of targeted agents have failed to demonstrate activity in PC patients.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)– and insulin like growth factor–1 receptor (IGF-1R)–mediated signaling
have widely been considered attractive targets for anticancer therapy.2,3 These pathways regulate cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and invasion.4-6 Further, there is preclinical evidence that aberrations in these pathways play a role in
tumor maintenance of PC.7,8 A phase III trial of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib added to gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone resulted in an improvement of 12 days in median survival time (6.24 vs 5.9 months) in favor of erlotinib,
with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69-0.99; P 5 238).9 However, in another phase III trial, the anti-EGFR

monoclonal antibody cetuximab, when added to gemcitabine, failed to provide any benefit compared with gemcitabine alone.10 A recent randomized phase II trial of
gemcitabine plus AMG479, a monoclonal antibody that
targets the IGF-1R, showed improvement in overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.41-1.04; P 5 .12)
when compared with gemcitabine alone.11
Unlike other cancers, PCs lack the activating mutations in the EGFR that would select patients who may
benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors.12 There is ample
evidence to indicate that blockade of a single receptor tyrosine kinase is insufficient to produce enough inhibition
of the downstream signaling to translate into a meaningful
clinical benefit. The redundancy and cross talk between
signaling pathways are at least partly responsible for the
failure of targeted therapies in patients with cancer.13,14
The rationale for this study was preclinical studies,
suggesting that simultaneous targeting of the EGFR and
IGF-R pathways resulted in more effective growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in various cancer cell
lines.15-19 Experimental findings suggested that inhibiting
either receptor alone resulted in reciprocal activation of
the downstream pathways that are shared by both receptors, which may explain resistance to either drug when
administered alone. Cixutumumab is a fully human
IgG1/k monoclonal antibody targeting IGF-1R with preclinical activity against pancreatic cancer.20 The recommended dose of a single agent for phase II studies was 6
mg/kg intravenously every week. In this study, a phase Ib
investigation of a cohort of patients to determine the optimal dose of cixutumumab in combination with erlotinib
and gemcitabine was completed prior to the randomized
phase II portion of the trial. The primary end point of the
phase II part of the trial was progression-free survival,
with overall survival and objective tumor response as secondary end points. Polymorphisms in genes involved in
gemcitabine metabolism, (ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1, deoxycytidine deaminase) and in EGFR-related
pathway (EGF, EGFR, IGF1, FCGR2A/3A, IL-8) were
selected for testing to explore any potential predictive or
prognostic impact.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients

Patients with metastatic histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who were previously not treated with
systemic therapy were eligible (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00617708). Patients were to have a Zubrod performance status (PS) 1, have evaluable or measurable

disease, and be without major comorbidities that would
preclude treatment with study medications. Patients were
to have adequate organ function determined by the following parameters: AST/ALT 2.5 times the upper limit of
normal, bilirubin within the normal range, creatinine
1.5 mg/dL, neutrophil count 1500/mm3, platelet
count 100,000/mm3, and fasting blood glucose within
the normal limits. Patients with a history of diabetes mellitus were allowed entry into the study, provided it was well
controlled. Patients who had received prior therapy with either gemcitabine or EGFR-targeting agents were not eligible. All patients provided signed informed consent in
accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.
Treatment

Patients received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously
over 30 minutes administered once weekly for 3 of 4
weeks. Erlotinib 100 mg was administered orally once per
day continuously. In the phase Ib portion of the study cixutumumab 6 mg/kg (starting dose level) was administered
on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle in addition
to the gemcitabine and erlotinib. The starting dose of cixutumumab (6 mg/g) in the combination was determined
to be sufficiently safe, and was used in the randomized
phase II portion of the study. The doses of cixutumumab
were planned to be reduced if sufficient adverse events
occurred in dose levels 1, 2, and 3 of 6, 4, and 3 mg/kg,
respectively. For phase II, patients were randomly
assigned to receive gemcitabine and erlotinib with or
without cixutumumab. Standard antiemetics were used
prior to the administration of gemcitabine. A treatment
cycle was 28 days. Treatment was continued until disease
progression, undue toxicities, or patient refusal.
Statistical Considerations

The primary end point for the phase II portion of this trial
was progression-free survival (PFS), with overall survival
(OS) as a secondary end point. Based on a type 1 error of
10% and 90% power, approximately 106 patients were
needed to detect improvement from 2 to 3.3 months (corresponding to a hazard ratio of 1.65). This sample size also
had approximate 82% power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.6
for OS (corresponding to improvement from a median of 6
months to a median of 9.6 months). PFS was calculated
from date of registration to date of first documentation of
progression or symptomatic deterioration (as defined
above), or death because of any cause. Patients last known
to be alive and progression free were censored at date of last
contact. OS was measured from date of registration to date
of death from any cause. Patients last known to be alive

On-Study Evaluations

Patients were evaluated by history and physical examination at baseline and at each clinic visit (approximately at 4week intervals). Zubrod performance status was determined at each visit. At the beginning of each cycle, patients
underwent evaluation of serum biochemistry including
fasting blood glucose. Cross-sectional imaging with either a
computerized tomographic (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed every 8 weeks.

Polymorphisms

Eighty-nine of 114 eligible patients’ genomic DNA was
extracted from peripheral white blood cells using a
QIAamp kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The samples were
tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction
fragment-length polymorphism technique. Briefly, forward and reverse primers were used for PCR amplification. PCR products were digested by restriction enzymes
(New England Biolab, Ipswich, MA); alleles were separated on 4% NuSieve ethidium bromide–stained agarose
gel, and/or samples were analyzed by direct sequencing.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. A total of 134
patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma were
registered in the study between March 1, 2008, and September 1, 2010. Ten evaluable patients were accrued into
the phase I b portion of the study. In the randomized phase
II part of the study 124 patients were enrolled. Eight
patients were considered ineligible because of inadequate
hematologic function (2 patients), inadequate coagulation

function (2), inadequate hepatic function (2), poor performance status (1) and lack of documented metastatic disease (1). The median age of eligible patients was 63 years.
In the cixutumumab arm, 60% of patients were female versus 42% in the control arm. Both arms of the phase II study
were balanced with respect to known prognostic factors.
Two eligible patients in the control arm did not receive
protocol treatment and thus were not evaluable for adverse
event assessment. They are included in the efficacy analyses
according to the intent-to-treat principle.
Determination of the Recommended Phase II
Dose of Cixutumumab

Ten patients were treated in the phase Ib portion of the
study. All patients received cixutumumab at a dose of 6
mg/kg (dose level 1) in combination with gemcitabine
and erlotinib. There was only 1 dose-limiting toxicity, in
a patient who experienced an infusion-related allergic
reaction. It was therefore decided that the dose of cixutumumab at 6 mg/kg represented a safe dose to proceed
with the randomized phase II portion of the study.
Efficacy Parameters

One hundred and sixteen patients who participated in the
randomizd phase II part of the study were assessed for outcome. Median progression-free survival in both arms of
the study was 3.6 months (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.68-1.44;
P 5 .97; Fig. 1). Median overall survival in patients who
revived gemcitabine, erlotinib, and cixutumumab was
7 months versus 6.7 months in those who received gemcitabine and erlotinib (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.75-1.61;
P 5 .64; Fig. 2). There were 7 objective responses (2 confirmed) in the cixutumumab arm and 9 (3 confirmed) in
the control arm.

Toxicity Profile

The toxicity profile is presented in Table 2. NCI Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version
4.0 was used for reporting of adverse events. Patients
(n 5 114) who received any drug medication in the randomized phase II part of the study were eligible for toxicity evaluation. The median number of cycles administered was 3 and
2 in the experimental and control arms, respectively. The
most common adverse events in both arms of the study were
elevation of transaminases, fatigue, gastrointestinal, and hematologic. In patients who were assigned cixutumumab, the
most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity was hyperglycemia (Table 2). Hyperglycemia grades 1-4 were seen in 45% of
patients treated with cixutumumab, of whom 28% were
grade 3 or 4. Nineteen percent of patients in the control arm
had hyperglycemia, 1 patient with grade 4. No patients discontinued treatment on protocol because of hyperglycemia.

Gemcitabine Metabolism and EGFR Pathway
Polymorphisms

Patients in this molecular correlates study were similar to
the overall data set in demographics and outcomes. No significant differences in PFS by genotype were seen for any of
the 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this
data set. The only nominally significant difference was in
IGF1, with control-arm patients showing a hazard ratio
(95% CI) comparing GG with AA/AG of 2.00 (1.063.78); P 5 .033. Among patients in the cixutumumab arm,
it was 0.87 (0.44-1.73); P 5 .69. This was the only SNP
with some hint of interaction with the treatment arm,
although the evidence was pretty weak (P 5 .066).
DISCUSSION
The demonstration of benefit from systemic therapy in
advanced pancreatic cancer remains very challenging.
Multiple trials testing conventional cytotoxic drugs and
even targeted agents have failed to show a major impact
on the natural history of this disease.2 Erlotinib, an oral
EGFR kinase inhibitor, was associated with marginal benefit when combined with gemcitabine in patients with
advanced disease. However, cetuximab, a monoclonal
antibody against EGFR, failed to demonstrate any benefit
in a similar patient population. Collectively, these results
suggest that in unselected patients, targeting the EGFR
pathway alone has a very small impact on patients with
stage IV pancreatic cancer. Possible explanations for this
include the high frequency of oncogenic KRAS mutations
present in pancreatic cancer, de novo resistance to antiEGFR drugs, and the absence of activating mutations of
the receptor in patients with pancreatic cancer.
Another recognized mechanism of resistance to targeting the EGFR pathway is signaling through the IGF-1R-

driven pathway and vice versa. Preclinical work supports the
simultaneous blockade of both receptors to achieve more
effective inhibition of cell proliferation and survival by abrogating downstream signaling shared by both receptors.21-27
The effectiveness of dual blockade is thought to be a consequence of the inhibition of reciprocal downstream signaling
through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/
ERK pathways that occurs when either receptor is individually blocked by a single targeted therapy.
This study failed to demonstrate any benefit with the
addition of cixutumumab to the combination of erlotinib
and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas based on any of the proposed efficacy
parameters. Progression-free survival, the primary end point
of this study, was identical in both arms. The dose of cixutumumab was the maximum tolerated single dose of the drug
established in previous phase I studies. There was no
increase in toxicity with the addition of the experimental
drug that would have reduced exposure to treatment relative
to the control arm of the study. In particular, the incidence
and severity of hyperglycemia were not dose limiting, with
28% of patients experiencing a grade 3 or 4 toxicity.
A potential explanation for the lack of benefit when
targeting either EGFR or IGF-1R remains the high frequency of downstream KRAS mutations in patients with
pancreatic cancer. Such mutations result in increased signaling by the KRAS gene product that may not be responsive to blockade of the upstream EGFR or IGF-1R. Given
the very low frequency (20%) of the wild-type KRAS genotype in pancreatic cancer, it would be very difficult to
test with a reasonable degree of certainty the influence of
KRAS mutation status on the outcomes of this study.28
Moreover, the identical outcomes of the primary end point
in the 2 study arms makes further molecular exploration of
archived tumoral material from study participants less
likely to produce a subgroup that exhibits a meaningful
association between a certain molecular profile and treatment outcome. In this study, the strategy of targeting 2 cell
surface receptor molecules did not demonstrate the validity
of such a treatment approach. A possible explanation would
be the inability of this strategy to overcome growth and
survival-promoting signals from downstream mutations
involving molecules other than KRAS, such as those in the
PI3K/AKT axis.29 Other mechanisms of resistance to the
EGFR blockade may include the epithelial-tomesenchymal transformation and activation of signaling
pathways such as the c-MET-driven pathway that would
entail different combination therapies.30-33 The S1115
study conducted by SWOG, will test inhibition of KRAS
effector pathways by dual targeting of MEK and Akt in
2984

patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01658943).
This study explored the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of genes associated with gemcitabine metabolism
and the EGFR-related pathway with clinical outcomes.34-38
None of the 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms tested was
significantly associated with PFS in either treatment arm. A
false-egative result cannot be excluded given the limited number of patients in the study, which was further limited by
stratifying both treatment arms. Further, a larger biomarkerembedded clinical trial is needed to confirm the predict/prognostic role of these polymorphisms.
The outcome of this study provides further evidence
of the difficulty in successfully developing targeted therapies in patients with pancreatic cancer in the absence of
molecular determinants of response and/or resistance to
the tested drug or drug combinations. At this time, there
are no biomarkers that predict benefit from drugs targeting EGFR or IGF-1R pathways, and the role of KRAS
mutations remains poorly defined.39,40 Therefore, future
testing of combinations of targeted agents will require a
better selection of targets and must be based on stricter
preclinical testing in multiple pancreatic cancer tumor
models.
