Frequency in Colorectal Tumors with Oncogenic KRAS
Mutations

Abstract
KRAS mutations are frequent in colorectal cancer (CRC) and are associated with clinical resistance to treatment
with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–targeted monoclonal antibodies. Delta-like 4 ligand (DLL4) is
an important component of the Notch signaling pathway and mediates stem cell self-renewal and vascular
development. DLL4 inhibition in colon tumor cells reduces tumor growth and stem cell frequency. Considering
the need for new drugs to treat colon cancers with oncogenic KRAS mutations, we examined in this study the
efficacy of anti-DLL4 antibodies in KRAS mutant tumors in a panel of early passage colon tumor xenograft models
derived from patients. Consistent with clinical findings, mutant KRAS colorectal xenograft tumors were
insensitive to the EGFR therapeutic antibody cetuximab, whereas KRAS wild-type tumors responded to
cetuximab. In contrast, anti-DLL4 was efficacious against both wild-type and mutant KRAS colon tumors as
a single agent and in combination with irinotecan. Further analysis of mutant KRAS tumors indicated that the
anti-DLL4/irinotecan combination produced a significant decrease in colon cancer stem cell frequency while
promoting apoptosis in tumor cells. Our findings provide a rationale for targeting DLL4-Notch signaling for
improved treatment of CRC patients with activating KRAS mutations. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1520–5. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the
HER-ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, plays an important role in modulating cellular proliferation, adhesion, angiogenesis, migration, and survival in colorectal cancer (CRC; ref. 1).
Agents that are directed against the EGFR signaling cascade
have showed significant clinical benefit in CRC; however, the
response rate in the overall population is limited to approximately 10% (2, 3), in part due to the complexity of EGFR signaling
pathways and alteration of downstream molecules.
KRAS is an intracellular signaling molecule that functions
downstream of EGFR and other receptor tyrosine kinases.
Oncogenic mutation of KRAS by amino acid substitution at
codons 12, 13, and 61 results in constitutively active protein
(4). KRAS mutations are found in approximately 40% of colorectal tumors (5). The presence of mutant KRAS in colon
tumors correlates with poor prognosis and is associated with

treatment resistance to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies
cetuximab or panitumumab (6–9). These clinical findings have
led the European Medical Agency (EMEA) to restrict the use of
anti-EGFR antibodies to CRC patients with wild-type KRAS.
Similarly, based on a comprehensive review of the relevant
literature, the American Society of Clinical Oncology released
a Provisional Clinical Opinion recommending that metastatic
CRC patients with a KRAS mutation in codons 12 or 13 should
not receive anti-EGFR antibody therapy (10). Therefore, there
is a critical need for new therapies to treat the large segment of
CRC patients with activating KRAS mutations.
Accumulating evidence has indicated that epithelial
tumors, such as CRC, are frequently composed of heterogeneous cell types that vary in their ability to initiate new tumor
growth and that cancer stem cells (CSCs, also referred to as
tumor-initiating cells) drive tumor growth and progression,
and are preferentially resistant to many current therapies (11).
The Notch pathway has been shown to be involved in the
development of normal tissues and is frequently dysregulated
in cancer; in particular, Notch signaling is known to play an
important role in normal colon development and in colon
cancer (12, 13). Delta-like 4 ligand (DLL4) is an important
component of Notch-mediated stem cell self-renewal and
vascular development. Inhibition of DLL4 has been shown
to result in broad spectrum of antitumor activity due to
dysfunctional angiogenesis (reviewed in ref. 14). We identified
another mechanism of action of anti-DLL4 directly acting on
tumor cells and reducing cancer stem cell frequency in colon
and breast tumors (15). In the present study, we evaluated the

Anti-DLL4 Is Active in KRAS Mutant Tumors

antitumor effect of anti-DLL4 on colorectal tumors bearing
oncogenic KRAS mutations using colorectal human tumor
xenograft models derived from patient samples.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies
The generation of anti-human and anti-mouse DLL4 antibodies was described previously (15).
Mutation analysis
The purified genomic DNA sequence data were obtained by
amplifying genomic DNA samples with the Repli-G Mini Kit
(Qiagen) followed by PCR amplification, purification, and
sequencing with the ABI 3730xL DNA Sequencer (Applied
Biosystem).
In vivo animal studies
The establishment and characterization of colon xenograft
models from patient specimens were described previously (15).
All xenograft tumors were generated at OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. except UM-C4, which was obtained from the University of Michigan. Tissue samples were provided by the
Cooperative Human Tissue Network, which is funded by the
National Cancer Institute. Other investigators may have received
specimens from the same subjects. Information on tissue origin
and histopathologic diagnosis was evaluated by pathologists.
Frozen cells or freshly dissociated single cells (see details in
Supplementary Materials and Methods section for preparation
of single cell suspension) were injected subcutaneously to NOD/
SCID mice for efficacy studies. Treatment started when
the mean tumor volumes reached about 100 mm3. Irinotecan
(7.5 mg/kg), cetuximab (10 mg/kg), and anti-DLL4 antibody
(1:1 mixture of anti-human and anti-mouse DLL4 antibodies at
10 mg/kg final concentration) were administered intraperitoneally once a week throughout the course of study.
In vivo limiting dilution assay
The procedures for tumorigenicity study were described
previously (15) and detailed in Supplementary Materials and
Methods section.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Tumor RNAs were isolated using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue
Mini Kit (Qiagen) with DNAse I treatment. Total RNA (about
0.5 mg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA. Quantitative realtime (RT) PCR was done in an ABI 7900 HT Fast Real-Time
PCR System and analyzed using the SDS software v2.3
(Applied Biosystems). The results were normalized with the
housekeeping gene GADPH. All primer and probe sets were
obtained from Applied Biosystems.
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections were
cut 4–5 mm thick. Immunohistochemistry was done by dewaxing sections, performing HIER using pH6 buffer in a pressure
cooker, blocking for endogenous peroxidase, and then overnight (PBS, 10% horse serum, 1% BSA, and 0.1% Tween-20).

The primary antibodies used in this study included anti Ki-67
mAb, clone MIB-1 (Dako), and anti-cleaved caspase-3, clone
FA1E (Cell Signaling Technologies). Slides were visualized
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies
using Nova Red substrate (Vector Laboratories), counterstained with hematoxylin.
Flow cytometric apoptosis assays
Single cell suspensions depleted of mouse cells (cell isolation described in Supplementary Materials and Methods
section) from control and treated tumors were fixed and
assayed for active caspase-3 (FITC Active Caspase-3 Apoptosis
Kit, BD Biosciences), and costained with an APC-conjugated
EpCAM mAb (Miltenyi Biotec) or by the TUNEL method, APODIRECT Kit (BD Biosciences), per manufacturers protocol.
Events were acquired on a BD FACSAria II flow cytometer and
analyzed on BD FACSDiva.
Protein preparation, ELISA, and immunofluorescence
assays
See Supplementary Data.
Data analysis
In vivo data are expressed as mean SEM. Differences in
mean values between groups were analyzed by two-way
ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Bonferroni post
tests. Ex vivo data are expressed as mean SD. Differences in
mean values between groups were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Tukey's post
tests. Differences of P < 0.05 are considered significantly
different. Statistical analysis was done with GraphPad Prism5
(GraphPad Software Inc.).

Results and Discussion
Sensitivity of KRAS wild-type and mutant colorectal
xenograft tumors to cetuximab
On the basis of sequence analysis, a number of colorectal
xenograft tumors with wild-type KRAS, KRASWT (OMP-C8 and
-C40) and mutant KRAS, KRASMT (UM-C4, OMP-C9, -C12, and
-C22) were identified (Supplementary Table S1). We next
evaluated the effect of anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab on
the growth of KRASWT and KRASMT colorectal xenograft
tumors. As seen in Fig. 1A and Table 1, cetuximab was
efficacious against KRASWT OMP-C8 and -C40 colon tumors,
reducing tumor volume to about 50% compared with control
mAb-treated tumors. In contrast, cetuximab was ineffective in
all 4 KRASMT colon tumors examined (Fig. 1B and Table 1).
There was no correlation between cetuximab sensitivity and
EGFR protein expression (data not shown). For example, both
KRASWT OMP-C40 and KRASMT UM-C4 expressed similar
EGFR protein levels; although KRASWT OMP-C40 tumor
was sensitive to cetuximab-mediated growth inhibition,
KRASMT UM-C4 was nonresponsive to cetuximab. Our findings were consistent with clinical analysis demonstrating no
association between EGFR expression and response to cetuximab (16). The antagonist activity of cetuximab was validated
in xenografts, as shown by the decrease of EGFR expression

and signaling (Supplementary Fig. 1). The lack of a growth
inhibitory effect against KRASMT colon tumors by cetuximab
was likely due to the inability of cetuximab to inhibit EGFR
signaling in the presence of a constitutively active RAS protein
downstream of the receptor (Supplementary Fig. 1B). These
data support the current hypothesis that an oncogenic KRAS
mutation but not EGFR expression correlates with cetuximab
sensitivity. Furthermore, these findings indicate that we were
able to recapitulate the efficacy of anti-EGFR inhibitors
observed clinically in preclinical models using primary colorectal xenograft tumors.
Irinotecan is a standard-of-care agent for the treatment of
CRC. In combination with cetuximab, it has showed an
improved progression-free survival, and overall survival in
some cases, in wild-type but not in mutant KRAS tumors
(17). We sought to evaluate the antitumor effect of this
combination in the primary colorectal xenograft tumors
mentioned above. Our data indicated that irinotecan was

1522

Cancer Res; 71(5) March 1, 2011

efficacious as a single agent against both KRASWT and
KRASMT colorectal xenograft tumors. However, the combination of irinotecan with cetuximab did not show a significant additive effect compared with single agent
irinotecan in all tumors examined except in KRASWT
OMP-C40, where the combination produced a statistically
significant greater antitumor effect than either agent used
alone. In KRASMT OMP-C12, combining cetuximab with
irinotecan resulted in reversing the antitumor response of
irinotecan alone. Our preclinical findings were consistent
with literature reports where the combination of irinotecan
and cetuximab provides no clinical benefits for KRASMT CRC
patients (16).
Effect of anti-DLL4 antibody on growth of KRAS wildtype and mutant colorectal xenograft tumors
On the basis of the above findings, we next evaluated
whether there was a therapeutic benefit of combining the

anti-DLL4 antibodies with irinotecan in KRASWT and in
KRASMT tumors. As seen in Table 1 and Fig. 1A and B,
anti-DLL4 was efficacious as a single agent in KRASWT tumors
and 2 of the 4 KRASMT tumors, OMP-C9 and OMP-C12.
In contrast to cetuximab, anti-DLL4 plus irinotecan produced a statistically significant antitumor effect greater than
irinotecan alone in all 6 tumors evaluated and this activity was
similar in KRASWT and KRASMT tumors. Histological analysis
indicated that treatment with anti-DLL4 reduced the frequency of proliferative cells and induced hyperproliferation
of tumor vasculature in both classes of CRC tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, the combination of anti-DLL4
and irinotecan resulted in tumor regression at the end of the
study in 4 of these 6 tumors, irrespective of KRAS status.
Taken together, the above findings indicated that anti-DLL4,
alone and in combination with irinotecan, was efficacious
against KRASWT and KRASMT CRC xenograft tumors.
Effect of anti-DLL4 antibody on KRAS-mutated colon
cancer stem cell frequency
It has been reported that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are
preferentially resistant to many standard therapies and that
CSCs mediate tumor recurrence following such treatments
(18). We previously showed that anti-DLL4 in combination
with chemotherapeutic agents reduced CSC frequency in
colon and breast xenograft tumors (15). Our previous studies
on colon CSCs were carried out with OMP-C8 tumors which
are wild type for KRAS. To extend these findings and to
determine whether the anti-DLL4-mediated growth inhibitory
effect in KRASMT colon xenograft tumors is associated with an
effect on tumor-initiating cells, we evaluated the effect of antiDLL4 on CSC frequency by serial in vivo transplant, limiting
dilution assay (19). This functional assay measures in vivo
tumorigenicity and makes no assumptions about the frequency, FACS marker profile, or heterogeneity of the

tumor-initiating cell population. KRASMT OMP-C9 tumors
were harvested at the end of 4-week treatment as shown in
Fig. 1B. As seen in Supplementary Fig. S3 and summarized in
Fig. 1C, control mAb treated tumors had a CSC frequency of 1/
149. Irinotecan treatment had no significant effect on CSC
frequency, slightly increasing the frequency to 1/105. On the
other hand, anti-DLL4 treatment alone decreased cancer stem
cell frequency by 2-fold versus control mAb-treated tumors.
Importantly, the combination of anti-DLL4 and irinotecan
produced a further decrease in tumor-initiating cell frequency,
about 4-fold lower than the control and irinotecan-treated
group and 2-fold lower than the anti-DLL4 treated tumors.
To investigate the mechanism of action of anti-DLL4 in
KRASMT tumors, gene expression analyses were carried out.
These analyses indicated that anti-DLL4 treatment altered gene
expression indicative of inhibiting Notch signaling and promoting colon cell differentiation (ATOH1 and CHGA) in OMP-C9
KRASMT tumors in a similar manner as in OMP-C8 KRASWT
tumors (15). In UM-C4 tumors where the combination treatment induced tumor shrinkage, irinotecan increased expression of the antiapoptotic gene HSPA6, whereas it decreased
levels of the proapoptotic gene PDCD4 (Fig. 2A). The combination of anti-DLL4 and irinotecan downregulated the induction
of HSPA6 and upregulated the expression of PDCD4 relative to
irinotecan alone, potentially leading to sensitization of tumor
cells to cell death and tumor regression and providing insight
into the mechanism for the synergy of these agents. To further
confirm that anti-DLL4/irinotecan-induced apoptotic gene
changes lead to cell death, a separate experiment was conducted in UM-C4 xenograft tumors. Apoptosis was analyzed by
flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analyses. We
observed an increase in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S4A) and a corresponding elevation in late-stage
apoptotic DNA fragmentation by anti-DLL4 and irinotecan
combination (Fig. 2C). The apoptotic induction by the combi-

In summary, our findings provide a rationale for targeting
CSCs and tumor vasculature through inhibiting DLL4 as a new
therapeuticapproachin thetreatment ofCRC. IncontrasttoantiEGFR, anti-DLL4 was equally efficacious in both KRASWT and
KRASMT tumors. Our findings suggest that targeting DLL4 may
improve the efficacy of current treatments for the large segment
of colon cancer patients with oncogenic KRAS mutations.
