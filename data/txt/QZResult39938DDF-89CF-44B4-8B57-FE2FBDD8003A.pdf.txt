ABSTRACT
Histone acetylation marks have an important role in controlling gene expression
and are removed by histone deacetylases (HDACs). These marks are read by
bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins and novel inhibitiors of these
proteins are currently in clinical development. Inhibitors of HDAC and BET proteins
have individually been shown to cause apoptosis and reduce growth of melanoma
cells. Here we show that combining the HDAC inhibitor LBH589 and BET inhibitor
I-BET151 synergistically induce apoptosis of melanoma cells but not of melanocytes.
Induction of apoptosis proceeded through the mitochondrial pathway, was caspase
dependent and involved upregulation of the BH3 pro-apoptotic protein BIM. Analysis
of signal pathways in melanoma cell lines resistant to BRAF inhibitors revealed that
treatment with the combination strongly downregulated anti-apoptotic proteins and
proteins in the AKT and Hippo/YAP signaling pathways. Xenograft studies showed
that the combination of inhibitors was more effective than single drug treatment
and confirmed upregulation of BIM and downregulation of XIAP as seen in vitro.
These results support the combination of these two classes of epigenetic regulators
in treatment of melanoma including those resistant to BRAF inhibitors.

these groups. The writers and erasers establish what is
referred to as a “histone code” that is “read” by a third
class of proteins that recognize the histone code and act
to focus large protein complexes including transcription
factors to those sites [7, 8]. These protein complexes
determine the gene expression status such as repression
or activation and may differ depending on the particular
tissues involved [9, 10].
We have shown previously that pan-HDAC
inhibitors can induce apoptosis in melanoma that is
associated with upregulation of BIM, BAX and BIK and

INTRODUCTION
Dysregulation of chromatin structure is a frequent
event in melanoma [1–3] and underlies many aspects
of melanoma biology including resistance to targeted
therapies [4, 5] and melanoma invasiveness [6]. The
regulation of chromatin structures is largely under the
control of several protein classes that modify histones.
These include proteins that add acetyl, methyl or other
groups to histones (writers) or “erasers” such as histone
deacetylases (HDACs) and demethylases which remove

downregulation of Bcl-XL and XIAP [5, 11, 12]. Such
inhibitors were also strongly synergistic with selective
BRAFi in induction of apoptosis of melanoma [4, 5].
Particular interest has focused on the development of
inhibitors against a highly conserved class of “reader”
proteins referred to as bromodomain and extra-terminal
(BET) proteins. Members of the BET family, which
consists of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and the testis specific
BRDT, have two bromodomains in the N-terminal
region which bind to acetylated lysines in histones and
a C-terminal (CT) region which binds to transcription
elongation factors (TEFs) [13, 14]. The bromodomains
act to target protein complexes to particular chromosomal
regions involved in gene transcription and act as
coregulators of transcription [14–16]. We have previously
shown that the BET protein inhibitor I-BET151 described
by Nicodeme et al. (2010) exerts anti-melanoma activity
by inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and inhibition of
tumor growth of xenografts in vivo [17, 18]. Additionally
I-BET151 has strong inhibitory effects on activation of
NF-kB [19].
In the present study we have examined whether
combining the HDAC inhibitor LBH589 (panobinostat)
and the BET protein inhibitor I-BET151 can potentiate the
changes seen when the inhibitors are used as single agents.
We report that combination of these two inhibitors has
strong synergistic effects in induction of apoptosis, cell
cycle arrest and against growth of melanoma xenografts.
Moreover apoptosis was mediated by the mitochondrial,
caspase-dependent pathway and involved downregulation
of the AKT and Hippo/YAP signaling pathway.

lines including melanoma cell lines from patients resistant
to treatment with the BRAFi vemurafenib (Patient-1-post
and Patient-3-post) which were relatively resistant to
both drugs alone (Figure 1B). To test if the induction of
apoptosis was synergistic rather than merely additive, we
performed a combination index (CI) study and calculated
synergy using CalcuSyn software. A CI less than 1.0 was
obtained in all tested cell lines, indicating a synergistic
interaction of both inhibitors with Patient-1-post cells
showing the strongest synergistic effect (Figure 1C, 1D).
Studies on the melanoma cell growth showed that
the combination of I-BET151 and LBH589 inhibited
cell growth and resulted in changes in cell morphology
characterized by enlarged and flattened cell bodies
(Supplementary Figure 2A). Cell cycle analysis showed
the expected sub-G1 population associated with
apoptosis and an increase in cells with either 2N DNA
content or 4N DNA content, suggestive of arrest in G0–1
or G2-M respectively (Supplementary Figure 2B-2C).
Alone, I-BET151 treatment predominantly increased the
percentage of melanoma cells with 2N DNA content
(G0–1 phase) while reducing the percentage of S-phase
cells. LBH589-treated cells increased the proportion of
cells with 4N DNA content. This increase in cells with 4N
DNA content may indicate cells arrested in G2-M or cells
which have failed to undergo cytokinesis and then arrested
in G1 but with a 4N DNA content. A similar increase in
cells with 4N DNA content was observed in combinationtreated cells (except Patient-1-post) suggesting that this
growth inhibitory effect is mostly a result of LBH589
inhibitor treatment. Treatment with I-BET151 increased
the 4N population in melanocytes. Cell cycle arrest was
associated with increases in the cell cycle inhibitor p21
(Supplementary Figure 2D) which was shown previously
to be responsible for cell cycle arrest by I-BET151 [17].
Taken together, these results indicate that the combination
of I-BET151 and LBH589 synergistically induces
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in melanoma, even in cells
with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.

RESULTS
Combined treatment with I-BET151 and
LBH589 synergistically induces apoptosis in
melanoma cells
To determine whether combined treatment of
I-BET151 and LBH589 can potentiate sensitivity of
melanoma cells to apoptosis we examined the cytotoxic
capacity of both inhibitors in a panel of melanoma
cell lines. Dose response curves in a number of cell
lines revealed dose-dependent cytotoxicity of the
drugs individually or in combination (Supplementary
Figure 1A). For subsequent experiments, 2 μM I-BET151
and 30 nM LBH589 were chosen as these concentrations
were only slightly toxic individually, but highly cytotoxic
in combination. Melanoma cells were treated with these
concentrations for 48 h before apoptosis was measured by
Annexin-V/PI staining. As shown in Figure 1A single drug
treatment of Me1007 cells with I-BET151 or LBH589
showed slight induction of Annexin-V/PI positive cells
when compared to DMSO treated cells. Treatment with
a combination of both inhibitors markedly increased cell
death. The same effect could be shown in other tested cell

Apoptosis induced by co-treatment with
I-BET151 and LBH589 is caspase dependent and
associated with mitochondrial depolarization
The presence of Annexin-V positive, PI-negative
cells following combined drug treatment (Figure 1A)
was suggestive of apoptosis – a form of cell death that
may be mediated by mitochondrial depolarization or
direct activation of caspases by cytoplasmic membrane
bound death receptors. We examined whether the
intrinsic mitochondrial pathway was involved by
use of the cell permeant dye JC-1 to measure loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔMOMP) in drugtreated melanoma cells. Flow cytometry data revealed that
single drug treatment only slightly induced mitochondrial
depolarization in melanoma cells (Figure 2A). However

BIM expression (Supplementary Figure 3A; 3B). BIM
is known to be one of the target genes regulated by the

other factors were involved in induction of apoptosis.

decrease in expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2,
Bcl-XL and XIAP. To give these findings wider relevance we
examined The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data (http://
cancergenome.nih.gov/) for the prognostic significance
of BIM and cleaved caspase 7 expression. As shown in
Supplementary Figure 3D, Kaplan-Meier survival curves
associated with TCGA protein data (RPPA) report that
overexpression of BIM and cleaved caspase 7 protein
is strongly correlated with improved patient survival.
We suggest that if the combination of drugs in this study
increases BIM and cleaved caspase 7 levels in melanoma
patients, as we have observed in mice and in vitro, this may
be associated with improved clinical outcomes.

Treatment of melanoma cells with the
combination of drugs results in downregulation
of proteins in the AKT and Hippo/YAP
signaling pathways
To elucidate which signaling pathways drive
induction of apoptosis by the drug combination, a reverse
phase protein array (RPPA) was performed. Cell lines
including Patient-1-pre and two of the vemurafenibresistant cell lines (Patient-1-post, Patient-3 post) were
either treated with DMSO, single drug or combination
and total protein lysates were prepared after 24 h. A RPPA
heatmap of the top 23 proteins changed by combined
I-BET151 and LBH589 treatment of all tested cell lines
is shown in Figure 4A. This revealed that most of the
proteins reduced by combination treatment were in the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (PRAS40_pT246, Akt_pS473,
Akt_pT308, 4E_BP1_pS65) or the Hippo/YAP pathway
(YAP_pS127, FoxM1, YAP) suggesting an involvement of
both pathways in combination-induced apoptosis. Proteins
upregulated included the pro-apoptotic BH-3 only protein
BIM and cleaved caspase 7.
To validate and extend the RPPA results we performed
western blotting on drug treated Patient-1-post and Me1007
cells to measure expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic
proteins. BIM was consistently upregulated in cells treated
with single drug or combination (Figure 4B). Additionally,
there were slight or variable changes in BAK and NOXA
expression and varying degrees of downregulation of BAX,
BAD and PUMA. There were consistent decreases in
expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and of the inhibitor of apoptosis
(IAP) protein XIAP and variable changes in MCL-1 and
cIAP (HIAP) protein expression (Figure 4C). Changes in
BIM, XIAP, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were also observed in other
cell lines tested (Supplementary Figure 3C). To determine
whether these observed changes of pro- and anti-apoptotic
protein expression were of relevance in mediating apoptosis,
we compared their expression in melanocytes that did not
undergo apoptosis when treated with the combination
(Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 2B). Protein expression of
pro-apoptotic BIM was increased 3-fold in melanocytes by
treatment with the combination (Figure 4D, 4E). However,
this was much less than that observed in Patient-1-post
and Patient-3-post cells where BIM increased by 6-fold
and 11-fold, respectively (Figure 4E). In contrast, protein
expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, XIAP and cIAP remained
unchanged in melanocytes, suggesting that expression of
the anti-apoptotic proteins prevented melanocytes from
undergoing apoptosis. Taken together these results indicate
that effectiveness of combination treatment on melanoma
cells is due to an induction of BIM and a simultaneous
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Induction of apoptosis is associated with
suppression of AKT and Hippo/YAP
signaling pathway
To obtain evidence for the importance of
downregulation of these pathways in the induction of
apoptosis we carried out western blots of key proteins
in both pathways. Consistent with the RPPA data, the
combination induced strong downregulation of p-AKT,
YAP1, p-YAP1 and p-PRAS40 protein expression in
Me1007 and Patient-3-post cells and other melanoma
cell lines, whereas no change in protein expression
could be observed in melanocytes (Figure 5A,
Supplementary Figure 4). To analyze the role of YAP1,
we further examined YAP1 mRNA expression by
quantitative RT-PCR analysis. This revealed a consistent
downregulation of YAP1 mRNA expression both in
melanoma cell lines Patient-1-post and Me1007 cells,
indicating that the combination of I-BET151 and LBH589
reduces YAP1 expression at the transcriptional level
(Figure 5B). Taken together these data indicate that the
drug combination inhibits two pathways known to be
involved in progression of melanoma.

Combination of I-BET151 and LBH589 inhibits
melanoma growth and prolongs survival in a
melanoma xenograft model
To determine whether combination of I-BET151
and LBH589 is effective in vivo, a subcutaneous
xenograft mouse model engrafted with Patient-1-post
cells was used, and mice treated with either vehicle
control, drugs alone or in combination (ten mice per
treatment arm). As shown in Figure 6A, treatment with
I-BET151 or LBH589 alone inhibited tumor growth
by 44.3% (p < 0.01, ANOVA, Dunnett’s post-hoc test)
and 22.3% (ns), respectively on day 15 when compared
to vehicle treated tumors. Combined treatment with
I-BET151 and LBH589 reduced tumor growth further
by 65.4% (p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival
of the mice revealed that, as compared to vehicle
control, treatment with I-BET151 (p < 0.01, Mantel
21515

Cox log rank test) but not LBH589, prolonged the
survival (as defined by time to an ethical tumor volume
endpoint) of mice. Combined treatment with I-BET151
and LBH589 further prolonged survival as compared
with I-BET151 alone (Figure 6B) (p-value < 0.05).
These results were extended using clonogenic assays
on Me1007, Mel-RM and Patient-1-post cells which
showed that the combination was superior to that of
individual drugs (Supplementary Figure 5A; 5B).
Consistent with in vitro analysis, immunohistochemical
staining confirmed induction of BIM and cleaved
PARP and a decrease of XIAP in tissue sections of
xenografts harvested from mice in the survival study
following euthanasia. Again, the strongest effects on
BIM, cPARP and XIAP expression level were observed
in the combination-treated cells (Figure 6C, 6D).
Moreover a separate experiment investigating short term
effects on xenografts following drug treatment showed
induction of BIM mRNA and a reduction of YAP1
mRNA expression in combination-treated tumor tissue
xenografts (Figure 6E). Taken together, these findings
indicate that combined treatment with I-BET151 and
LBH589 inhibits tumor growth in vivo and prolongs
survival of mice with melanoma xenografts.

described to mediate G0–1 and/or G2-M arrest in different
tumors [24–27] by induction of the cell cycle inhibitor
p21 [27]. In the present studies the combination of
LBH589 and I-BET151 caused enhanced expression of
p21 compared to each drug alone and an increase in the
number of cells with 4N DNA content, suggestive of arrest
predominantly in the G2-M phase.
Similarities in the proteins targeted by the two drugs
are perhaps not unexpected as both drugs act by targeting
acetylated histones. Previous studies have also reported
that inhibitors of BET proteins and histone deacetylases
share transcriptional signatures for genes involved in
cell cycle and apoptosis [28]. Studies on a wider range
of proteins by RPPA revealed strong downregulation
of proteins in the AKT pathway that was not evident
in studies on melanocytes. This was reported by others
[29, 30] and results from acetylation of Hsp90 and thereby
loss of its chaperone activity against proteins like AKT,
EGFR and STAT3 [24, 30, 31]. Both I-BET151 treatment
alone and in combination with LBH589 increased BIM
mRNA, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism driving
the increase in BIM protein levels.
Given that AKT is a major regulator of cell
survival and apoptosis [32], its downregulation could
promote apoptosis by a number of mechanisms. This
includes phosphorylation of the transcription factor
FOXO3a which prevents its entry into the nucleus and
thereby its upregulation of BIM [32]. Our data showing
upregulation of BIM is consistent with this and further
supported by studies showing that knockdown of
FOXO3a prevented upregulation of mRNA for BIM
by the drug combination. The exact involvement of
FOXO3a requires further study however as while both
siRNA molecules reduced BIM mRNA expression by
a similar amount, one was less effective at preventing
apoptosis. A number of factors could cause this,
including differential effectiveness of the siRNA to
reduce FOXO3a protein levels and BIM independent
effects of FOXO3a. Induction of BIM is certainly not
the only mechanism by which the drug combination
induces cell death. This is demonstrated by the fact
that knockdown of BIM by siRNA failed to completely
prevent apoptosis, indicating that other factors were
involved such as the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic
proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and XIAP. This interpretation
was consistent with studies on melanocytes that had no
decrease in anti-apoptotic proteins and did not undergo
cell death despite a 3-fold increase in BIM protein
expression. Sustained PI3K activity was also reported
to protect melanocytes from apoptosis [33, 34]. The
importance of changes in anti-apoptotic proteins in the
induction of apoptosis by HDACi was supported by
previous studies showing that overexpression of Bcl-2
and Bcl-XL suppressed apoptosis induced by the histone
deacetylase inhibitors LAQ824 and LBH589 [35].
Several questions raised from the RPPA studies remain

DISCUSSION
HDACs are frequently components of protein
complexes that repress gene expression by removing
acetyl groups from histones [5]. BET proteins on the
other hand are components of complexes that target
transcription factors to acetylated histones particularly
at sites of so called super enhancers [20, 21]. We
reasoned that HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), by increasing
acetylation of histones, would increase interaction with
BET proteins and increase the sensitivity of cells to BET
protein inhibitors. Our results support this hypothesis
and the combination of these drugs was more effective
than either drug alone in inducing apoptosis and arresting
tumor growth in melanoma. Apoptosis was mediated by
classical mitochondrial and caspase dependent pathways
and involved upregulation of the BH3 pro-apoptotic BIM.
This was accompanied by downregulation of a range of
anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and XIAP.
These results are consistent with our previous
studies on the individual inhibitors which showed that
HDAC inhibitors resulted in upregulation of several
pro-apoptotic proteins and downregulation of Bcl-XL
and XIAP [5, 11, 12]. Similarly we found that I-BET151
induced BIM expression (but not NOXA or PUMA) as
well as downregulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and XIAP [17].
In addition to effects on apoptosis, cells cultured in the
drug combination underwent morphological changes
of flattening and spreading as well as cell cycle arrest.
Single drug treatment with I-BET151 induced G0–1 arrest
[17, 22, 23]. In contrast, LBH589 treatment has been

unanswered. One is the role of strong downregulation
seen of YAP and phosphorylated YAP induced by the
combination in induction of apoptosis. These proteins
are in the Hippo pathway which appear important in
progression of uveal melanoma. Dephosphorylation
of YAP by the mutant Gq11 component of G protein
coupled receptors allows its entry into the nucleus
[36]. On entry into the nucleus it acts as a co-factor
with transcription factors such as TEADs and SMADs
to induce genes involved in cell cycle regulation such
as FOXM1 and Cyclin D1 [37] and to inhibit apoptosis
by regulation of IAP proteins [38]. It was notable in the
present studies that these proteins were downregulated
in melanoma cells treated by the combination of HDAC
and BET protein inhibitors and questions whether these
changes contributed to apoptosis. Downregulation of the
YAP proteins appeared to be transcriptional as shown
by the marked downregulation of YAP mRNA and
not due to binding to intra-cytoplasmic proteins that
regulate entry into the nucleus, such as 14-3-3 proteins
[38]. Given YAP’s involvement in uveal melanoma
further studies appear warranted to assess effects of the
combination on uveal melanoma.
Another question is why many changes seen in
melanoma cells are not seen in normal melanocytes.
Similar findings were reported in studies on isogenic
normal and transformed cells treated with HDACi which
showed a tumor selective pro-apoptotic gene signature [39].
Presumably, epigenetic mechanisms that are targeted by the
two inhibitors have been selected to protect the melanoma
cells against apoptosis and in maintaining their proliferation.
These questions are the subject of ongoing studies.
The availability of protein arrays in the The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) data allowed us to examine
whether the changes in proteins seen in our studies
with this combination of drugs might have prognostic
significance in larger populations of patients. This showed
that high levels of BIM and cleaved caspase 7 were highly
associated with improved survival, implying that changes
induced by the combined drugs may have beneficial
effects on survival. These conclusions were supported
by the results of the studies on melanoma xenografts in
NOD/SCID mice which showed that the combination of
I-BET151 and LBH589 significantly improved survival of
the mice challenged with the vemurafenib-resistant Patient1-post melanoma cell line compared to either drug alone.
The same synergistic effects of the drug combination
were seen in colony formation assays. In vivo responses
were accompanied by similar changes in protein levels of
BIM and XIAP as found in vitro. The present finding of
synergistic effects between these two classes of drugs are
consistent with similar findings in studies on human acute
myelogenous leukemia cells showing that the combination
of the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 and HDACi
LBH589 was superior to treatment with either agent alone

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in inducing apoptosis and survival of NOD/SCID mice
engrafted with acute myelogenous leukemia cells [23].
In summary this study shows that combined
inhibition of HDAC and BET proteins has synergistic
effects in the treatment of melanoma in vitro and in vivo
which are associated with more marked increases
in upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM and
downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2,
Bcl-XL and XIAP than seen with the single drugs alone.
The treatment combination was associated with marked
downregulation of the AKT pathway and of YAP
proteins in the Hippo pathway. Further studies are
needed to understand how these pathways are regulated
epigenetically. These preclinical studies provide a basis for
considering combinations of these epigenetic inhibitors in
new treatments for melanoma particularly those resistant
to BRAFi.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Melanoma cell lines Patient-1-pre, Patient-1-post,
KMJR138, Patient-3-post, Me1007 and Mel-RM
have been described previously [40]. Patient-1-pre,
Patient-1-post, and Patient-3-post are patient cell lines
established before treatment or during relapse from
treatment with vemurafenib, labeled “pre” and “post”,
respectively, as described elsewhere and are all BRAFV600E
mutant cell lines [41]. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptavidin
(AusGeneX, Brisbane, Australia). Human melanocytes
(HEM) were purchased from Life Technologies (Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and cultured in Media 254 complemented with
Human Melanocyte Growth Supplement (Gibco, Victoria,
Australia).

Chemicals and transfection
I-BET151 was supplied by GlaxoSmithKline
(Brentford, UK). LBH589 (Panobinostat) was purchased
from Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA). Cells were
treated with either with 2 μM I-BET151, 30 nM LBH589
or combination and control cells were treated with
DMSO. For inhibition of caspase activity, 10 μM of
Q-VD-OPh (SM Biochemicals, Anaheim, CA, USA)
was added to culture medium 30 minutes before other
additional treatment. For gene knockdown studies, cells
were transiently transfected with siRNA of BCL2L11
(siRNA#1: SI04951968; siRNA #2: SI02655359 Qiagen,
Venlo, Netherlands), FOXO3a (siRNA #1: SI04916366,
siRNA #2: SI04916387) or a non-silencing control
(1027281, Qiagen) using Lipofectamine RNAiMax
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the

21517

Oncotarget

manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were transfected 24 h
before being drug-treated for a further 48 h.

(Littleton, CO, USA), pYAP1 (pS127, ab76252) from
abcam (Cambridge, UK), cIAP/HIAP-2 (AF 8181)
from R&D (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and alpha-Tubulin
(B-5-1-2) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). After
washing, membranes were probed with the appropriate
secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
Antibody binding was visualized using ClarityTM Western
ECL substrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Band
intensities were quantified by using ImageJ software.

Analysis of cell death, synergy, cell cycle and
mitochondrial membrane potential
Percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using
Annexin-V/Propidium Iodide (PI) staining following the
manufacturer’s instructions (Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, CA, USA) and analyzed employing a Becton
Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest
Pro software. Synergy of drug interactions was calculated
using the fixed ratio/combination index method [42].
Apoptotic cells were measured by Annexin-V/PI staining
and combination index (CI) calculated using CalcuSyn
software Version 2.1 (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). CI with
values < 1.0 indicate a synergistic interaction of both drugs
in the combination and CI values < 0.5 indicate strong
synergy. For cell cycle analysis, cells were stained with
PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle was fitted
to viable cells using ModFit LT software (Verity Software
House). Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential
(ΔMOMP) were stained with the membrane determined by
staining cells with JC-1 as described by the manufacturer
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) followed by flow
cytometry analysis.

qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy
Plus mini prep kit (Qiagen), quantitated using a Nanodrop
(Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and 1 μg
RNA reverse transcribed with SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen).
cDNA was amplified on AB7900 (Applied Biosystems,
Mulgrave, VIC) using Universal PCR Master Mix and
Taqman probes specific for BIM (Hs00708019_s1),
YAP (Hs00371735_m1), Foxo3a (Hs00818121_m1) and
normalized to levels of endogenous 18S (Hs99999901_s1)
(Applied Biosystems).

In vivo experiments
All animal experiments were performed with
approval from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre
Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee. Female
NOD/ SCID mice (Animal Resources Centre, Western
Australia) were injected subcutaneously into the flank
with 4 × 106 Patient-1-post cells in 50% Matrigel. Once
tumors had grown to approximately 130 mm3, mice
were randomized into four groups of ten mice and each
group administered 15 mg/kg I-BET151 via oral gavage
daily, 4 mg/kg LBH589 via ip injection days 1–5 each
week, drug vehicles or the combination of both drugs.
Tumor volumes were determined thrice weekly and
mice were euthanized once tumors exceeded 1200 mm3
or the animals showed signs of distress. Following
euthanization, tumours from 4 mice per treatment arm
were randomly chosen for IHC analysis. Additionally,
a separate, short term experiment was performed in
which mice harbouring xenograft tumours were given
a single dose of each drug or combination before
being euthanized and sacrificed after 3 h. Fresh frozen
tumour sections were collected for mRNA analysis. This
experiment was performed on 3–4 mice per treatment
group.

Reverse phase protein array (RPPA)
Cell lines were either treated with DMSO, 2 μM
I-BET151, 30 nM LBH589 or combination for 24 h.
Lysates were prepared as recommended by MD Anderson
Cancer Center (Houston, Texas, USA), arrayed on
nitrocellulose-coated slides, probed for a standard list of
antibodies at the MD Anderson Cancer Center and results
were quantified and normalized using their procedure
[43]. Genes with insufficient signal were filtered out. For
heatmaps, differential protein expression was calculated
by subtracting log2 transformed protein levels of control
(DMSO) treated cells from treated cells.

Western blotting
Tumor cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose
membranes and probed with the following primary antihuman antibodies: BIM (C34C5), Bax (2772), PUMA
(4976), caspase 7 (9492), caspase 9 (9502), AKT (9272)
and phospho AKT (pS473, 9271), pPRAS40 (pThr 246,
2997) all from Cell Signaling Technology (Cambridge,
UK), Bcl-2 (C-2, sc-7382), Bcl-XL (H-5, sc-8392), Bak
(G-23, sc-832), caspase 3 (sc-7148), PARP (F-2, sc-8007),
GAPDH (sc-32233), YAP1 (sc-15407) from Santa Cruz
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-MCL-1 (559027) and antiXIAP, (610716), BAD (610392) from BD Bioscience
(San Jose, CA, USA), NOXA (114C307.1) from Imgenex
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin
fixed, paraffin embedded xenograft tissue and then
constructed into a tissue microarray (TMA). Where
feasible three tissue cores 1 mm in diameter were taken
from the donor paraffin block using the marked section
21518

Oncotarget

as a reference and arranged in a blank paraffin block
utilising a TMArrayerTM (Pathology devices, Westminster,
USA). Sections were incubated with the respective
primary antibodies at the following dilutions: BIM
(1:100, CS2933), cPARP (1:100, CS9541), XIAP (1:200,
BD610716). Antibody detection was performed on a
Dako Autostainer Plus (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) using
the MACH 3 visualization kit (M3R530 and M3R531,
Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturers’ protocols.

Quantitative image analysis
TMA sections were scanned using the
multispectral Vectra slide scanner (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, USA). Brightfield images were captured
at 20 nm intervals from 420 nm to 720 nm at 4x and 20x
magnifications for low power and high power images
respectively. The captured images were analyzed using
the quantitative InForm image analysis software [44].
Dependent on the immunostain present, the software
could then measure and score the intensity of the
immunostaining on a cell by cell basis and an H-score
(scale 0–300) which considers both the intensity and
percentage of cells staining at each intensity bin (0 + to
3 +) [45] or percentage positive/negative ratio was
reported.
