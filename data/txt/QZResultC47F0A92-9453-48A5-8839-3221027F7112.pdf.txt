Abstract
Despite recent advances, treatment options for advanced prostate cancer (CaP)
remain limited. We are pioneering approaches to treat advanced CaP that employ
conditionally replication-competent oncolytic adenoviruses that simultaneously
produce a systemically active cancer-specific therapeutic cytokine, mda-7/IL-24,
Cancer Terminator Viruses (CTV). A truncated version of the CCN1/CYR61 gene
promoter, tCCN1-Prom, was more active than progression elevated gene-3 promoter
(PEG-Prom) in regulating transformation-selective transgene expression in CaP and
oncogene-transformed rat embryo cells. Accordingly, we developed a new CTV,
Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7, which displayed dose-dependent killing of CaP without harming
normal prostate epithelial cells in vitro with significant anti-cancer activity in vivo
in both nude mouse CaP xenograft and transgenic Hi-Myc mice (using ultrasoundtargeted microbubble (MB)-destruction, UTMD, with decorated MBs). Resistance
to mda-7/IL-24-induced cell death correlated with overexpression of Bcl-2 family
proteins. Inhibiting Mcl-1 using an enhanced BH3 mimetic, BI-97D6, sensitized CaP
cell lines to mda-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis. Combining BI-97D6 with Ads expressing
mda-7/IL-24 promoted ER stress, decreased anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 expression and
enhanced mda-7/IL-24 expression through mRNA stabilization selectively in CaP
cells. In Hi-myc mice, the combination induced enhanced apoptosis and tumor growth
suppression. These studies highlight therapeutic efficacy of combining a BH3 mimetic
with a novel CTV, supporting potential clinical applications for treating advanced CaP.

INTRODUCTION

when CaP has metastasized to bones and distant organs
[1]. For that reason, it is imperative to find a means of
preventing or treating CaP after it has metastasized.
Some success in treating advanced CaP patients with
bone metastases has been achieved using external beam
radiation therapy, hormonal-therapy and chemotherapy
with bisphosphonates, which target bone remodeling

Prostate cancer (CaP) is the leading cause of
cancer deaths in men in the USA despite improvements
in chemo-, radio-, and hormonal-therapies. The 5-year
survival of CaP patients with loco-regional disease is >
95%, but survival rates decrease dramatically to < 28%

a new class of CTV, i.e., Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7).
To optimize the utility of viruses for gene therapy
it is essential to develop approaches to systemically
administer these agents in a manner that limits nonspecific trapping in non-target organs (such as the liver)
and elimination by the immune system. To address these
impediments to effective gene therapy we have developed
a “stealth delivery approach”, called ultrasound-targeted
microbubble-destruction (UTMD), to systemically
deliver viruses such as CTV-m7 [12, 22, 23]. Further
improvements in tumor-specific delivery can be achieved
using MBs by functionalizing with linkers or ligands to
form targeted or decorated MBs (D-MBs) [24, 25] to
specifically bind to the tumor vasculature and inflamed
tissues around the tumor. In principle, D-MBs coupled
with the UTMD approach will provide an effective
means of releasing the CTV-m7 payload specifically at the
tumor region following sonoporation [22-25] leading to
oncolysis at the site of direct infection and mda-7/IL-24induced cell death in adjacent and distant tumor cells.
Considering the slow growing and progressive
nature of CaP and also the development of resistance to
conventional treatment with a single agent, employing a
combinatorial approach with agents affecting different
cancer-specific pathways may be required to effectively
treat advanced CaP. Moreover, it was found that ectopic
expression of Mcl-1 or Bcl-2 family of proteins in prostate
cancer cells led to resistance to mda-7/IL-24-induced cell
death [23]. The Bcl-2 family of proteins is commonly
over-expressed in prostate cancers especially in advanced
hormone refractory prostate cancer [26]. BH3 mimetics,
which function as inhibitors of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
proteins, were able to sensitize CaP cells to chemotherapy
[23, 27]. To further validate this hypothesis, it is necessary
to confirm cancer-selective activity in appropriate
pre-clinical animal models, including those with a
compromised immune system (permitting growth of
human CaP cells) and immune-competent genetically
engineered transgenic mouse models of CaP. We now
demonstrate that CTV-m7 (Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7) delivered
by a UTMD approach using D-MBs in combination with
small molecule inhibitors of Mcl-1 (e.g., BI-97C1 and BI97D6) [27, 28], promotes CaP regression in multiple preclinical animal models. These provocative observations
provide a path for potentially translating this combinatorial
approach and innovative therapeutic strategy into the
clinic for the treatment of advanced hormone refractory
CaP.

[2]. Although the effectiveness of these combination
treatment strategies appeared promising they were limited
to the areas of bone they target and were ineffective at
later stages of metastasis. Additionally, the side effects
of current treatment approaches mandate innovative and
improved strategies to treat CaP, especially advanced CaP.
Viral-based gene therapy is currently considered an
attractive tactic to treat various cancers. However, since
CaP is a relatively slow growing disease, it may require
repeated gene therapy applications over the life span of
the patient to be effective. In these contexts, conditionally
replication competent adenoviruses (Ads) (CRCA) that
selectively induce cytolysis in prostate cancer cells with
concomitant production of a therapeutic gene represent a
potential treatment option for patients with CaP, including
those with metastatic disease. The therapeutic potential
of oncolytic Ads or CRCAs has been evaluated in human
clinical trials [3, 4]. They were found to be safe and well
tolerated in patients with advanced cancers [5, 6], although
therapeutic efficacy as single agents was not promising.
The route of administration of oncolytic viruses has
predominantly involved intratumoral injection [7], and
restricted effectiveness potentially resulted from limited
intratumoral spread from the injection site [8].
Therapeutically armed bipartite conditionallyoncolytic Ads, such as Ad.PEG-E1A-mda-7 (Ad.PEGCTV-m7 or Ad.CTV-m7) [9-12] in which replication is
controlled by the progression elevated gene-3 promoter
(PEG-Prom) resulting in simultaneous production of
mda-7/IL-24, have wider applications for cancer therapy
showing enhanced activity in killing cancer cells in vivo
as compared to single conditionally-oncolytic Ads [9, 13,
14]. The improved therapeutic potential of Ad.CTV-m7
is mediated by the mda-7/IL-24 transgene, which when
translated produces and secretes MDA-7/IL-24 protein
that induces “bystander” [15, 16] cancer-specific cytotoxic
effects eliminating both primary transduced tumor cells as
well as adjacent non-transduced tumor cells and distant
metastases [11, 12, 15, 17]. In vitro cell culture and in vivo
pre-clinical animal studies support the use of CTV-m7
as a potential reagent to treat local as well as advanced
CaP [11-13], providing proof-of-concept for CTV as an
efficacious reagent for cancer therapy.
The CCN1/CYR61 gene displays elevated expression
as a consequence of oncogenic transformation in various
cancers including CaP [18, 19], and expression increases
with aggressiveness of the transformed cells [19, 20].
Regulation is predominantly controlled at a transcriptional
level [19, 21]. Based on these considerations, we
evaluated the CCN1-Prom for cancer-selective expression
and identified a truncated version of this promoter
(tCCN1-Prom) as a potential genomic reagent to develop
conditionally replication-competent Ads. Ads were
engineered in which the tCCN1-Prom controls Ad E1A
expression and the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter
(CMV-Prom) controls mda-7/IL-24 expression resulting in

of c-Jun, which is a cofactor for AP-1 binding, in a
panel of CaP cell lines. As compared to normal immortal
prostate epithelial cell lines, RWPE-1 and P69, CaP cells
including PC-3, PC-3ML, DU-145 and ARCaP-M showed
higher expression of c-Jun (Fig 1A). This observation
suggested that the tCCN1-Prom could serve as a cancerselective prom for making cancer-selective oncolytic
Ads and potentially CTVs. To monitor promoter activity
quantitatively we cloned the 5’-flanking promoter region
of the tCCN1-Prom (approximately 830-bp of the full
length CCN1-Prom), inserted it upstream of a luciferase
reporter gene and evaluated cancer-selective activity
of this tCCN1-Prom in CaP cell lines. As predicted,

Construction and characterization of Ad.tCCN1CTV-m7
CCN1/CYR61 is an early response gene regulated
transcriptionally in a protein kinase C (PKC)- and cyclic
AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)dependent manner, which is often elevated in diverse
cancers including CaP [18, 19, 29, 30]. Since the tCCN1Prom has AP-1 binding sites, we determined expression

higher in Ad.tCCN1-luc-injected tumors as compared to
Ad.PEG-luc-injected tumors (Fig. 1D and 1E). Based
on these observations, we constructed Ad.tCCN1-E1Amda-7 (Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7), a conditionally replicationcompetent Ad (CRCA) in which the tCCN1-Prom controls
the Ad replication genes E1A and E1B and a CMV-Prom,
a ubiquitous expressing promoter, controls mda-7/IL-24.
This was accomplished using two shuttle vectors, pE1.2
and pE3.1-CMV, as shown in Suppl. Fig. 1.
As shown in Suppl. Fig. 2A, enhanced expression
of MDA-7/IL-24 was evident in Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7infected CaP cells as compared to a normal immortal
prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE-1. In contrast, when
using a constitutive non-cancer specific promoter, such as
CMV, expression of the transgene (in this case mda-7/IL24) was evident in RWPE-1 cells, even when infected at
low MOI (Supp. Fig. 2A). At a higher MOI (i.e., 1,000 vp/
cell), MDA-7/IL-24 expression was lower in Ad.tCCN1CTV-m7-treated CaP cells (Suppl. Fig. 2A), possibly
due to pronounced oncolysis. Since MDA-7/IL-24 is a
secretory cytokine, we quantified MDA-7/IL-24 protein
levels in the conditioned medium (CM) by ELISA. MDA7/IL-24 protein in the CM of Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7-treated
DU-145 and PC-3 cells was significantly higher (p<0.001)
as compared to non-replicating Ad.mda-7-treated DU-145

transfection with pGL3.tCCN1-luc resulted in elevated
luciferase expression in CaP cells as compared to RWPE-1
or P69 cells. Moreover, in the ARCaP series of CaP cells,
ARCaP-M cells derived from androgen repressed human
CaP (ARCaP) cells with bone metastatic capacity in vivo
and a mesenchymal phenotype had higher tCCN1-Prom
expression as compared to its epithelial-like counterpart,
ARCaP-E (Fig. 1B). CCN1-Prom activities were also
elevated in a series of single-oncogene transformed
Fischer rat embryo cell (CREF) lines (CREF-src, CREFraf, CREF-ras and CREF-HPV) [20, 31-33] as compared
to the immortal non-transformed parental CREF cell line
[34] and activity increased with the addition of tumorpromoting phorbol ester TPA (Fig. 1C), further supporting
the elevated activity of tCCN1-Prom in cancer progression
and metastases. Interestingly, in metastatic cells, e.g., PC3, PC-3ML and ARCaP-M, tCCN1-Prom activity was
significantly higher than the cancer-specific PEG-Prom
[35], which also shows elevated cancer-specific expression
in human CaP cells (Fig. 1B). To confirm these in vitro
observations, comparative in vivo promoter studies were
performed in nude mice containing DU-145 xenografts by
injecting 1010 vp of either Ad.tCCN1-luc or Ad.PEG-luc
intratumorally into the left or right flank, respectively, of
the same mouse. BLI signals were significantly (p=0.035)

CTV-m7, rather than by the ‘bystander’ effects produced
by secreted MDA-7/IL-24. A significant difference
(p<0.05) was evident between Ad.vec-infected and
Ad.tCCN1-CRCA- (Ad.tCCN1-E1A) and Ad.tCCN1CTV-m7-infected CaP cells, even with as little as 100
vp/cell. However, no significant difference was apparent
between Ad.vec-, Ad.tCCN1-CRCA- or Ad.tCCN1CTV-infected RWPE-1 cells at lower MOI (100 vp/
cell), supporting the cancer-selective properties of these
conditionally oncolytic viruses.

and PC-3 cells infected with similar MOI (100 vp/cell)
(Suppl. Fig. 2B). Additionally, the expression of secretory
MDA-7/IL-24 protein in the CM of RWPE-1 did not show
any significant changes between Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 vs.
Ad.mda-7-infected groups, indicating diminished tCCN1Prom activity leading to diminished Ad replication and
MDA-7/IL-24 secretion in normal epithelial prostate cells.
Previously, we showed that Ad.PEG-CTV-m7
reduced tumor burden at the injection site as well as
decreased tumor size at a distant location [10-12, 22] using
in vivo xenograft models. In order to determine whether
increased promoter activity of tCCN1 as compared
to PEG-3 would enhance cancer-selective activity by
reducing tumor burden in CaP, DU-145-luc cells were
injected s.c. in both flanks of male nude mice. When
the tumors reached ~100 mm3 in size with distinct BLI
signals, mice were randomly divided into four groups that
received (i) Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7, (ii) Ad.PEG-CTV-m7 (iii)
Ad.vec (control) or (iv) Ad.tCCN1-E1A intratumorally
(i.t.) only in the right flank as indicated in Materials and
Methods. Although in the treatment protocol both CTVs
diminished tumor burden in the primary and secondary
site (un-injected tumor) as compared to control groups,
Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 was more potent at a similar MOI
than Ad.PEG-CTV-m7 in reducing tumor size as measured
by BLI, especially in the un-injected secondary tumor as
observed after 28 days of treatment (Fig. 1F and 1G).
Moreover, we observed that both Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 and
Ad.tCCN1-E1A (CRCA) reduced the size of the primary
tumor (injected tumor), but the reduction of the secondary
tumor was more prominent with Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7
and Ad.PEG-CTV-m7 as compared to Ad.tCCN1-E1A
(CRCA lacking mda-7/IL-24) infected mice, supporting
the superiority of a CRCA with an additional therapeutic
arm, such as mda-7/IL-24, e.g., Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 and
Ad.PEG-CTV-m7 (our previously generated CTV), in
diminishing tumor growth at distant sites.

Apogossypolone derivative BH3 mimetics
sensitize CaP to mda-7/IL-24-mediated killing
CaP tumor samples from patients often overexpress
specific Bcl-2 family member proteins, especially Mcl1 and Bcl-xL [36-38]. Accordingly, expression of antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and apoptotic
proteins, Bax and Bak, in CaP and RWPE-1 cells was
determined using Western blotting analysis (Fig. 3A). As
shown in Fig. 3A, both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL were elevated
in CaP cells as compared to RWPE-1 cells. These Bcl-2
family proteins contain hydrophobic clefts as studied by
X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) that are able to bind the BH3 dimerization domain
of pro-apoptotic molecules. This strategy led to the
development of a series of BH3 mimetics or pan-Bcl-2
inhibitors, including Apogossypol, Apogossypolone and
derivatives [28] as shown in Suppl. Fig. 3. To examine the
apoptotic potential of Apogossypol and Apogossypolone
derivatives, we treated CaP cells, including DU-145, PC3, ARCaP, ARCaP-E, ARCaP-M, and normal immortal
prostate epithelial cells, RWPE-1, with BI-97C1 or BI97D6 [28] and found that both compounds inhibited cell
growth in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 values of
BI-97C1 and BI-97D6 in inhibiting cell growth of DU145, PC-3, ARCaP, ARCaP-E, ARCaP-M and RWPE-1 are
shown in Fig. 3B and Suppl. Fig. 4. The optically active
Apogossypolone derivative BI-97D6 was more potent
in inducing CaP-cell killing than BI-97C1. Additionally,
the IC50 value of BI-97D6 for CaP cells was significantly
different vs. RWPE-1.
In previous studies, we demonstrated that
suppression of Bcl-2 family member proteins is necessary
to promote the growth suppressing potential of mda-7/
IL-24 [23, 38]. Interestingly, forced expression of Mcl1 reduced mda-7/IL-24-mediated apoptosis in CaP cells,
which was reversed upon combined treatment with BI97D6 and mda-7/IL-24 (Fig. 3C and 3D) [20, 39, 40].
Considering these observations, we hypothesized that
combining a BH3 mimetic, such as BI-96C1 or BI-97D6,
with Ad.mda-7 would inhibit CaP cell growth and viability
and the combinatorial effect would be enhanced further
with Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 as compared to the replication
incompetent Ad.mda-7, specifically at a lower MOI.

Dose-dependent growth inhibition of CaP cells by
Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7
To test efficacy and selectivity of an Ad.tCCN1E1A (CRCA) and Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7, we infected a
panel of CaP cell lines with Ad.vec (Ad) (10,000 vp/cell),
Ad.tCCN1-E1A (CRCA) (10-1,000 vp/cell), replication
incompetent Ad.mda-7 (2,500-10,000 vp/cell) and
Ad.tCCN1-E1A-mda-7 (Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7) (10-1,000
vp/cell) for 72 h. As anticipated, the Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7
was more efficient in growth inhibition of CaP cells than
either Ad.vec or replication incompetent Ad.mda-7 (Fig.
2). Both Ad.tCCN1-E1A (CRCA) and Ad.tCCN1-E1Amda-7 (Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7) induced selective growth
inhibition in CaP cells in a dose-dependent manner.

apoptosis by enhancing ER stress-regulated
protein expression and translation of mda-7/IL24 mRNA into protein

non-replicating Ad.mda-7, a conditionally replicating
Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 was superior in inhibiting CaP cell
growth. The IC50 of Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7-infected CaP cells
was ~100-fold lower as compared to the non-replicating
Ad.mda-7. This is clinically relevant, since administering
a sufficient titer of CTV-m7 can easily be achieved based
on its cancer-selective replication at the tumor site, which
is not achievable with a non-replicating Ad.mda-7, and
activity can be further potentiated by using BH3 mimetics,
e.g., BI-97D6.
Experiments were next performed to interrogate the
potential molecular mechanism by which the combination
of mda-7/IL-24 and BI-97D6 affects the growth and
survival of CaP cells. We observed an increase in
phosphorylation of p38 as well as the ER stress marker
GRP-94 following Ad.mda-7 or Ad.CCN1-CTV-m7
infection and a decrease in expression of the anti-

of BI-97D6 and mda-7/IL-24 on cell growth, CaP cells
were infected with either Ad.mda-7 or Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7

growth was significantly decreased in DU-145, PC-3 and
ARCaP-M cells treated with Ad.mda-7 plus BI-97D6, as
compared to Ad.mda-7 treatment alone (Fig. 4). Similarly,
combining Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 with BI-97D6 enhanced
the decrease in cell growth as compared to cells treated
singly with Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7. As compared to the

infected with Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 was extremely low
as compared to both DU-145 and PC-3 (Suppl. Fig 5),
reflecting the cancer-selective replication of Ad.tCCN1CTV-m7 with concomitant production of MDA-7/IL-24
protein. The selective replication of Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7
in CaP cells was also confirmed by the detection of E1A
expression in infected DU-145 and PC-3 as compared to
RWPE-1 (Fig. 5A). The cancer-selective apoptosis by
mda-7/IL-24 along with the cancer-selective oncolytic
effects of Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 were more pronounced after
a longer incubation, as the CTVs were able to replicate
exponentially with time thereby producing elevated levels
of secreted MDA-7/IL-24 protein (Suppl. Fig. 5).
MDA-7/IL-24 levels were measured with a h-IL24 ELISA kit using several fold dilution of the lysates
as well as conditioned medium to define the relative
amounts of MDA-7/IL-24 in the detection range of
the kit. The level of expression of MDA-7/IL-24 was
enhanced by treatment with BI-97D6 when cells were
treated with Ad.mda-7 plus BI-97D6 vs. Ad.mda-7
alone (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, BI-97D6 also
enhanced mda-7/IL-24 mRNA levels. Similar results
were obtained with another class of BH3 mimetics, BI97C1 (Sabutoclax), suggesting that this phenomena may
be related to inhibition of Mcl-1 expression (Suppl. Fig.

apoptotic Mcl-1 protein. MDA-7/IL-24 expression in cell
lysates was lower in Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 as compared to
Ad.mda-7 infected cells at 48 h, which was partially due to
the lower MOI (100 vp/cell) of Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 used as
compared to the higher MOI (5,000 vp/cell) of Ad.mda-7,
and also a consequence of the pronounced oncolytic effect
that diminished cell survival and protein production.
However, both infective doses promoted similar levels
of induction of ER stress proteins, i.e., p38 and GRP-94,
which was enhanced further when viruses were combined
with BI-97D6 leading ultimately to apoptosis (Fig. 5A).
Apoptotic death was the preferred mode of cell killing in
DU-145 cells as evidenced by PARP cleavage (Fig. 5A),
whereas minimum cell death was observed in RWPE-1
cells. PARP cleavage was not as prominent in PC-3 as
compared to DU-145 using a similar MOI of Ads. This
may be due to intrinsic therapy- and apoptosis-resistance
of PC-3 as compared to DU-145. Moreover, PC-3
expresses reduced CAR resulting in restricted entry of Ad
and consequently lower transgene expression [41, 42], but
interestingly the apoptosis-inducing combinatorial effect
of Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 and BI-97D6 was also evident in
PC-3 as compared to either agent alone.
Interestingly, as predicted, the level of secreted
MDA-7/IL-24 protein in CM of normal RWPE-1 cells

changed following Mcl-1 inhibition, we tested promoter
activity of the CMV-Prom and mda-7-Prom following BI97D6 treatment and found that the regulation of mda-7/
IL-24 was not altered at a transcriptional level (Fig. 5D).
This prompted us to investigate the level of MDA-7/
IL-24 at a post-transcriptional level. DU-145 cells were
treated with Ad.mda-7 and/or BI-97D6 for 24 h followed
by addition of Actinomycin D (5 µg/ml) to stop new
mRNA transcription and mRNA stability was monitored.
The cells were collected at different time points posttreatment with Actinomycin D, mRNA was isolated and
qPCR was performed using an mda-7/IL-24 probe, and a
GAPDH probe was used as loading control. The half-life
(t1/2) of mda-7/IL-24 mRNA was ~120 min, which was

increased to ~240 min by the addition of BI-97D6 (Fig.
5E). These results suggest that BI-97D6, which inhibits
Mcl-1 expression, enhances the steady state level of mda7/IL-24 mRNA.

potential utility of the cancer-selective tCCN1-Prom for
developing oncolytic viruses with concomitant production
of a therapeutic cytokine, a CTV-m7 in this model.
The UTMD approach [22, 23] was used with
targeted/decorated MBs (D-MBs), complex, Biotin-antiV-CAM-1-Streptavidin-MBs (MB-SA-B-anti-VCAM-1;
D-MBs), to deliver Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 as described
in Materials and Methods. D-MBs were treated with
complement prior to injection into the tail vein of Hi-myc
mice, which partially shielded the Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 in
the circulation, avoiding direct activation of the immune
system [47-49]. The viral particles were then released at

as well as involvement of components of the immune
system [44, 45], it is essential to validate efficacy in an
immune-competent CaP animal model, such as the Himyc mouse [46]. Hi-myc transgenic mice share molecular
characteristics of human CaP. They develop prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) as early as 2 weeks
and invasive prostate adenocarcinoma by 6 months of
age [46]. Interestingly, CCN1 protein becomes elevated
in 6-month old Hi-myc mice as they develop locally
invasive prostate cancer (Fig. 6A). Expression of CCN1 is
significantly elevated in Hi-myc(+) mice vs. age-matched
groups of normal or Hi-myc(-) mice, suggesting the

the target site by sonoporation using ultrasound [22, 23].
To investigate the antitumor effects of Ad.tCCN1CTV-m7, alone or in combination with BI-97D6, 5-6
month old Hi-myc mice were divided into 4 groups
(n=5): i) Ad.vec; ii) Ad.vec + BI-97D6; iii) Ad.tCCN1CTV-m7; and iv) Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 + BI-97D6. Ad.vec
or Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 were mixed with D-MBs and
the resultant complexes, i.e., D-MB/CTV-m7 or D-MB/
Ad.vec, were systemically administered via tail vein
injection and sonoporated as described in Materials and
Methods. BI-97D6 was i.p. injected (3X per week for
a period of 4 weeks) at a dose of 3mg/kg mouse body
weight. The experiment was terminated after 4 weeks
and mice were sacrificed and the prostate tumors were
collected. There was a significant decrease in tumor size
in the Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7-treated group as compared to
the Ad.vec-treated group (Fig. 6B). Tumors were weighed
and showed a significant decrease in tumor weight
(p<0.01) in the Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7-treated group as
compared to Ad.vec-treated group with a further decrease
in tumor weight (p<0.001) in the Ad.tCCN-CTV-m7
+ BI-97D6-treated group (Fig. 6B). H&E staining of
sections prepared from the treated mice further confirmed
the efficacy of the single and combination treatments.
Invasive prostatic adenocarcinomas were observed in
Ad.vec-treated 6-month old Hi-myc mice, whereas the
invasive prostatic adenocarcinomas displayed decreased
size in the Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7-treated group and were
barely detectable in the combination-treated groups. The
prostate glands of 6-month old Hi-myc mice receiving the
combination of Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 + BI-97D6 appeared
normal in comparison with matched age group wild type
or Hi-myc (-) mice (Fig. 6C) with minimal symptoms of
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). These results
indicate that prostate pathology observed in Hi-myc mice
can be inhibited by treatment with Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7+
BI-97D6, suggesting potential clinical significance of this
combination in treating CaP.
The decrease in tumor size was associated with a
reduction in cell proliferation as evidenced by lack of
PCNA expression and increased cell death reflected by
positive TUNEL staining (Fig. 6D). The expression of
MDA-7/IL-24 in the prostate gland was also evident in
Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7- and combination-treated animals
(Fig. 6D). Although, there was cell death and inhibition of
cell proliferation in the single-treated group (i.e., Ad.vec
+ BI-97D6 or Ad.CCN1-CTV-m7), the effect was more
pronounced and robust in the combination-treated group
(Fig. 6D).

clinical trials [50]. However, the efficacy of these viruses
in treating various cancers has been limited [13, 14, 51,
52]. In order to increase the selectivity, efficacy and safety
of viral CaP therapy, organ-specific promoters targeting
prostate epithelial cells have been utilized to drive
prostate-specific replication competent Ads, e.g., CV706
or Ad(I/PPT-E1A) or CG7870 [5, 53, 54], which appeared
safe and promoted a tumor response when injected intraprostatically [5, 53, 54]. Although organ- or tissue-based
promoters may be effective in the treatment of primary
tumors when delivered directly into the tumor, efficacy is
compromised when they are administered systemically to
treat primary tumors and metastatic disease [13, 14, 23].
To enhance the cancer therapeutic efficacy
of CRCAs, particularly in the context of metastatic
disease, we developed unique bipartite CRCAs
displaying cancer-specific replication and simultaneous
production of a therapeutic cytokine [11-14, 17, 49].
This was accomplished by using a ubiquitous cancerselective minimal promoter derived from rodent
progression elevated gene-3 (PEG-3) [35] to control
E1A expression, with concomitant production of the
IL-10 gene family member mda-7/IL-24 that induces
cancer-selective apoptosis and toxic autophagy [45,
55], referred to as a Cancer Terminator Virus (CTV;
Ad.PEG-E1A-mda-7; Ad.PEG-CTV-m7) [10-14, 22].
Previous studies indicated that the CCN1/CYR61 gene
and its promoter are upregulated in various cancers and
responsible for malignant and metastatic transformation
[19, 20]. Clinical studies suggest that the expression of
CCN1 correlates with tumor stage, size, lymph node
involvement, and represents a poor prognostic factor in
various cancers, including prostate [18, 19, 56]. Based
on these considerations, we determined the activity of a
truncated tCCN1-Prom in a collection of CaP cells. As
predicted, the tCCN1-Prom was upregulated in all CaP
cells in comparison to RWPE-1 normal prostate epithelial
cells. Moreover, the activity of tCCN1-Prom was more
prominent in metastatic CaP cell lines, e.g., PC-3, PC3ML and ARCaP-M, as compared to less aggressive CaP
cells. Additionally, the tCCN1-Prom had higher activity
(p<0.05) as compared to the PEG-Prom in CaP metastatic
cells, supporting the potential utility of the tCCN1-Prom
in generating engineered CRCAs and CTVs. In this report,
we have generated a CTV in which the tCCN1-Prom
drives replication with simultaneous production of mda-7/
IL-24, e.g., Ad.tCCN1-E1A-mda-7 (Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7).
Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 displays enhanced activity in CaP
both in vitro and in vivo as compared to Ad.PEG-CTV-m7
and Ad.mda-7 [10, 22, 49] (Figs.1 and 2).
The inability to efficiently and selectively
administer CRCAs systemically has restricted their
ability to successfully treat patients with cancer, including
primary tumors and metastases [13, 14, 22, 47]. To
mitigate these hurdles we are using complement-treated
polycarbonate microbubbles (MBs) and ultrasound, i.e.,

the Agogossypol derivative BI-97C1 (Sabutoclax) in
inhibiting the binding of BH-3 peptides to Bcl-xL, Bcl2, Mcl-1 and Bfl-1 [28]. In this context, we hypothesized
that BI-97D6 might prove more potent than BI-97C1
(Sabutoclax) in abrogating the activities of the protective
Bcl-2 family of proteins especially Mcl-1. Indeed we
showed that BI-97D6 selectively induced CaP cell death
(Fig. 3), reversed therapy-resistance and enhanced mda7/IL-24-mediated cell killing (Fig. 4). Additionally,
we showed that BI-97D6 and Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7
cooperatively induced ER stress-mediated apoptosis.
Interestingly, our observations indicated that BI-97D6
also stabilized mda-7/IL-24 mRNA, thus enhancing the
production of MDA-7/IL-24 protein and concurrently
mda-7/IL-24-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5). mda-7/IL-24
contains a 3’UTR with AU-rich elements (ARE, which
lead to unstable mda-7/IL-24 mRNA [60]). mda-7/IL-24inducers regulate the expression of this transgene at the
post-transcriptional level by stabilizing its mRNA [60, 61].
These previous findings are compatible with our current
results, which establish BI-97D6 as an inducer of mda7/IL-24. Our data also supports the use of Ad.tCCN1CTV-m7 in complex with decorated microbubbles using
the UTMD approach to effectively target the prostate
gland in immunocompetent Hi-myc mice. This was
confirmed by expression of MDA-7/IL-24 followed by
cell death in CaP sections from the Hi-Myc mice that
lead to diminished prostate tumor size, all of which were
further enhanced by BI-97D6 (Fig. 6).
In summary, the significant CaP antitumor
effects observed following combination treatment with
Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 + BI-97D6 is a summation of
multiple independent biological attributes of these agents
including: a) cancer-selective oncolytic activity mediated
by Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7; b) cancer-selective antitumor
effects mediated by both Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 and BI97D6; and c) ‘bystander effects’ mediated by Ad.tCCN1CTV-m7 through production and the secretion of MDA7/IL-24 protein. Considering the safety profile and
initial promising results of BH3 mimetics and oncolytic
Ads when combined with standard chemotherapeutic
regimens, defining the correct combination of agents will
be pivotal to enhancing anti-tumor effects in the clinic.
In principle, a combination of a BH3 mimetic, such as
BI-97D6 with more pronounced Bcl-2/Mcl-1 inhibitory
activity, with a CRCA such as Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7
expressing a systemically active cytokine, mda-7/IL24 [62-64], should elicit profound efficacy toward both
primary and metastatic tumors in the clinic. Of particular
clinical relevance is our demonstration that decorated
(targeted) MBs can be used to encapsulate Ad.tCCN1CTV-m7 and deliver this virus systemically in animals
resulting in profound anti-cancer activity in Hi-myc mice,
which is enhanced further when animals also receive i.p.
injections of BI-97D6 (Fig. 6). Future studies are required
to determine the clinical utility of this combination and the

ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD),
to reduce trapping of viruses non-specifically in organs
such as the liver and to diminish immune detection and
clearance [12, 22, 23]. The UTMD approach has been
used to selectively deliver in a “stealth manner” both
non-replicating viruses and CTVs systemically to tumors
in both nude mice containing human CaP xenografts and
immune competent transgenic animals developing CaP,
resulting in significant pre-clinical anti-cancer activity
[22, 23]. To refine further the UTMD approach, we have
now used modified (decorated) microbubbles (D-MBs)
in which biotinylated anti-V-CAM-1 is complexed with
streptavidin microbubbles (MB-SA), resulting in D-MBs,
i.e., biotin-anti-V-CAM-1-streptavidin-MBs. These
D-MBs accumulate in the tumor vasculature and after
US the contents of the MBs, which contain either Ad.vec
or Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7, are released and can now infect
prostate cells in the Hi-myc mice (Fig. 6). This strategy
has wide applicability for delivering therapeutic agents
(including viruses, therapeutic nucleic acids, drugs) to
tumor cells and when combined with the ability to produce
and secrete a therapeutic cytokine (such as mda-7/IL-24 in
the CTV) engenders this approach with the ability to treat
both primary and metastatic tumors.
The effectiveness of CRCAs as cancer therapeutics
in both pre-clinical and clinical settings is enhanced when
used in combination with other therapeutic modalities,
including chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy
and radiation therapy [57, 58]. A critical determinant of
combinatorial efficacy is the choice of the most appropriate
therapeutic agent to use with the CRCA for a specific
cancer indication. The Bcl-2 family of proteins, especially
Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, were found to be elevated in CaP and
higher expression correlated with therapy resistance, thus
representing a potential target for primary cancer treatment
and combinatorial treatment with CRCAs [36-38 59]. Bcl2 family proteins contain a hydrophobic cleft that binds
with only BH3-motif containing pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins (Bax, Bak, Bad), antagonizing apoptosis
and enhancing cell survival. Structural analyses using
X-ray crystallography and NMR assisted in designing
various chemically synthesized BH3 mimetics that inhibit
the binding of BH3-containing pro-apoptotic proteins with
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, thereby inducing apoptosis
via a Bcl-2-dependent pathway.
We demonstrated previously that mda-7/IL-24induced ER-stress response caused apoptosis in CaP
cells by inhibiting Mcl-1 translation, which was reversed
by overexpression of Mcl-1 [38]. These observations
suggested that BH3 mimetic Mcl-1 inhibitors and mda-7/
IL-24 might cooperate synergistically to induce apoptosis
in CaP. This hypothesis has been validated by the findings
that the Apogossypol derivative BI-97C1 (Sabutoclax),
which targets Mcl-1, sensitized CaP cells to mda-7/IL-24mediated toxicity [23]. The Apogossypolone derivative
BI-97D6 is potentially ~5-10-fold more active than

For this therapeutic experiment, spontaneous CaP
developing Hi-myc male mice of 5-6 months of age were
used. Hi-myc mice were randomly divided into 4 groups
(n=5): i) Ad.vec; ii) Ad.vec + BI-97D6; iii) Ad.tCCN1CTV-m7; and iv) Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 + BI-97D6. Ad.vec
or Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 were mixed with D-MBs and the
resultant complexes, i.e., D-MB/Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 or
D-MB/Ad.vec, were systemically administered via tail
vein injection (2 X week for a period of 4-weeks) and
sonoporated as mentioned above in the prostate region.
BI-97D6 was i.p. injected (3 X per week for a period of
4-weeks) at a dose of 3-mg/kg mouse body weight. The
experiment was terminated after 4-weeks and mice were
sacrificed and the prostate tumors were collected.

Athymic nude mice were injected s.c. in both flanks
with 2 X 106 DU-145 cells. When tumors reached ~100
mm3 in size, 1010 vp of Ad.PEG-luc or Ad.tCCN1-luc
were injected i.t. (intratumorally) in the right and left flank
tumors, respectively. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was
done using an IVIS spectrum (Califer Life Sciences, Inc.,
Hopkinton, MA) [12] 72-h post injection.
Athymic nude mice were injected s.c. in both flanks

or visible by BLI, mice were randomly divided into four
subgroups (n=5) receiving injections i.t. only in the right
flank of either Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7, Ad.PEG-CTV-m7,
Ad.tCCN1-E1A or Ad.vec (control) at a dose of 1010 vp per
