TGFb/TNFa-Mediated Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition
Generates Breast Cancer Stem Cells with a Claudin-Low
Phenotype

Abstract
Breast cancer recurrence is believed to be caused by a subpopulation of cancer cells that possess the stem cell
attribute of treatment resistance. Recently, we and others have reported the generation of breast cancer stem
cells (BCSC) by epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), although the physiologic process by which these cells
may arise in vivo remains unclear. We show here that exposure of tumor cells to TGFb and TNFa induces EMT
and, more importantly, generates cells with a stable BCSC phenotype which is shown by increased self-renewing
capacity, greatly increased tumorigenicity, and increased resistance to oxaliplatin, etoposide, and paclitaxel.
Furthermore, gene expression analyses found that the TGFb/TNFa-derived BCSCs showed downregulated
expression of genes encoding claudin 3, 4, and 7 and the luminal marker, cytokeratin 18. These changes indicate a
shift to the claudin-low molecular subtype, a recently identified breast cancer subtype characterized by the
expression of mesenchymal and stem cell-associated markers and correlated with a poor prognosis. Taken
together, the data show that cytokine exposure can be used to generate stable BCSCs ex vivo, and suggest that
these cells may provide a valuable tool in the identification of stem cell-directed biomarkers and therapies in
breast cancer. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4707–19. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer recurrence is believed to be caused by a
subpopulation of cancer cells possessing stem cell attributes
of tumor initiation, resistance to chemotherapy, radiation,
and other forms of treatment (1–3). Breast cancer stem cell
(BCSC) characteristics can be induced through genetic and
epigenetic mechanisms or extrinsically by microenvironmental stimuli, conferring many unique properties such
as ability to seed tumors at sites distant from the primary
tumor, resistance to apoptosis-inducing drugs, and
enhanced migratory and metastatic potential (3–6). Current
challenges in BCSC research include identifying unique and
reliable molecular markers for BCSC isolation and generating stable, homogeneous BCSCs for propagation in culture
for drug screening and identifying therapeutic targets. Several techniques have been used to enrich BCSCs, including
sorting for CD24/lowCD44þ cells, selecting for side population cells that exclude Hoechst dyes, isolating spheroids
(mammospheres) from suspension cultures, or isolating

ALDH1 positive cells (7–10). Recently, we and others (11–
13) have showed the generation of cancer stem cells through
induction of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a
biological process involving coordinated molecular, biochemical, and cellular changes resulting in the loss of
cell–cell adhesion, apical–basolateral polarity, and epithelial
markers, but acquisition of motility, spindle cell shape, and
mesenchymal markers (14–16).
Defining how EMT processes contribute to BCSC phenotypic characteristics in vivo has been limited by the lack of
experimental models that recapitulate the processes known to
induce EMT in vivo. Prior studies have shown that stable BCSC
populations can be produced by forcing expression of key
transcription factors (12). By contrast, induction with TGFb, a
major inducer of EMT during tumor progression (14–18) had
previously led to only transient activation of BCSC characteristics (12). In our previous report, we showed that in vivo
generation of stable BCSCs required CD8 T cells suggesting
that multiple pathways must be activated in addition to TGFb
(11). Given that prior studies have shown that TNFa, an
inflammatory mediator associated with cell-mediated immunity, results in a stable EMT phenotype when used with TGF-b
(17), we speculated that this combination of cytokines also
results in stable generation of cells with the BCSC phenotype.
To test this, we exposed breast cancer cells derived from an
epithelial breast tumor to the cytokine combination and
derived stable cell populations with BCSC characteristics.
Furthermore, the ex vivo generated BCSCs had characteristics
of the claudin-low breast cancer subtype. These findings
provide key insight into BCSC development in vivo and

establish a new in vitro experimental model for generating
mesenchymal BCSCs for evaluation of characteristics and
methods of therapeutic targeting.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
Mouse mammary carcinoma cell line (MMC) is an epithelial tumor cell line established from a spontaneous tumor of
a neu-transgenic (neu-tg) mouse as previously described
(11). Both MMCTT and ETTM were generated twice by
treatment of MMCs with 100 ng/mL TGFb and 50 ng/mL
TNFa for 30 and 60 days, respectively. MMCTTE cells were
epithelial cells derived from MMCTT cells upon withdrawal
of TGFb and TNFa treatment and subsequent culture for 30
days. Antigen-negative variants (ANV) cells are mesenchymal breast cancer stem-like tumor cell lines produced in vivo
by injection of MMC cells into nontransgenic parental FVB/
N mice (11). Derivation of ANV5 was confirmed by using
fluorescent in situ hybridization of the rat neu gene and
karyotyping analysis (11). MMC and ANV5 cells were tested
for mycoplasma by using PCR-based IMPACT Profile III test
(RADIL) and together with the in vitro derived MMCTT and
ETTM cell lines maintained in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamate, and antibiotics. MCF10A cells were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas) and immediately
resuscitated and expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM)/F12 medium containing 5% horse serum,
epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, hydrocortisone, and
antibiotics. ATCC conducted authentication on MCF10A cell
lines through short tandem repeat profiling, karyotyping,
and cytochrome c oxidase I testing. Test for bacterial and
fungal contamination was carried out by ATCC by using
current United States Pharmacopeia methods for viral testing adhering to United States Code of Federal Regulation (9
CFR 113.53) guidelines, mycoplasma testing via direct culture and Hoechst DNA staining and Limulus amoebocyte
lysate assay to measure endotoxin values. The cells were
then split when enough cells were obtained and then immediately treated with the cytokines or frozen as seeding
stocks. All cell lines were treated with Placmocin (InvivoGen) every 2-weeks to prevent mycoplasma contamination.
MCF10ATT cells were generated in duplicate by treatment of
MCF10A cells with same doses of TGFb and TNFa for 40
days. TGFb and TNFa were purchased from R&D System (St
Paul).
RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and qPCR
Total RNA was purified from cells by using RNeasy Plus kit
(Qiagen). RNA quantity and purity were determined by using a
NanoDrop ND-1000, and RNA integrity was assessed by
determining the RNA integrity number and 28S/18S ratio
by using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). PCR
primers were designed with PrimerQuest (IDT, Inc.). Reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out by using SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) by
using 200 ng of RNA in a Bio-Rad MyCycler. PCR samples

4708

Cancer Res; 71(13) July 1, 2011

were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels and imaged on a Gel Doc
XR (Bio-Rad). First strand cDNA for quantitative PCR (qPCR)
was synthesized by using the RT2 First Strand cDNA Kit
(SABiosciences). Gene expression and signaling pathway analyses were done by using RT2 Profiler PCR Array qPCR kit and
detected with the RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix
(SABioscience) according to the manufacturer's protocol
and run on ABI 7900HT with standard 96 block (Applied
Biosystems). Expression analysis was conducted by using
the manufacturer's online analysis tool and gene expression
was normalized to housekeeping genes. Differential expression is measured as fold expression relative to the MMC
cell line.
Immunoblot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared with standard radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and after determining protein concentration, equal protein amounts of samples were resolved by
SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes, blocked with 5% nonfat milk in tris-buffered
saline and Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibody
at room temperature for 4 hours or overnight at 4 C. After
incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking buffer, protein
expression was detected by using SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Primary polyclonal
antibody to E-cadherin, N-adherin and b-actin-HRP, and
secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-b-actin was used as a loading
control.
Mammosphere formation assay and cell imaging
For mammosphere formation, MMC, MMCTT, ETTM,
MCF10A, and MCF10ATT cell lines were grown in 4 mL
DMEM/F12 media with 1:50 B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL
EGF, 20 ng/mL, 10 mg/mL insulin, penicillin, streptomycin,
and amphotericin B in 12-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells/
mL as described previously (19). Additional 0.5 mL of media
was added every 3 days for 15 days. The number of mammospheres formed were observed and counted under a Leica DC
200 microscope (Leica Microsystems). Images of spheroids
and adherent cells were obtained with a Leica DC 200 microscope (Leica Microsystems) and Fujifilm FinePix 6800 Zoom
camera (Fujifilm).
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
Cell surface expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, CD24,
and CD44 on MMC, MMCTT ETTM, MCT10A, and
MCF10ATT cells was determined by flow cytometry analysis
on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Cells were incubated
with conjugated or nonconjugated primary antibodies at
4 C for 30 minutes, washed, and then stained with secondary
antibody for 30 minutes. The cells were then fixed with
washing buffer containing 0.5% formaldehyde and run on a
BD FACScan flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson and Company). Sorting of CD24/CD44+ cells was done on a BD
FACSVantage Cell Sorter, and data were analyzed by using
WinMDI version 2.8 software (http://en.bio-soft.net/other/

WinMDI.html). Antibodies used included anti-CD24 PE
(eBioscience), anti-E-cadherin phycoerythrin (PE), anti-E-cadherin fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and anti-CD44 FITC
(BD Pharmingen), and anti-N-cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibody FITC goat anti-rabbit IgG were
from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Isotype antibodies were PE Rat IgG2b (eBioscience) and FITC Rat IgG2b
(BD Pharmingen).
In vivo tumorigenicity
Female neu-tg mice on the FVB/N background were maintained as a colony and in vivo tumorigenicity assays were
conducted according to Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) policy. Appropriate numbers of MMC,
MMCTT, and ETTM cells were injected subcutaneously into
the mice and tumor size measured until the mice were
sacrificed. Tumors were measured every other day with vernier calipers, and volumes were calculated as the product of
length  width  height  0.5236.
In vitro cell migration and invasion assay
Migration of MMC and ETTM cells were assessed by using
noncoated membrane transwells (24-well insert; pore size, 8
mm; BD Biosciences). About 5  104 cells suspended in serumfree medium were plated in the top chamber, and medium
supplemented with serum was used as a chemoattractant in
the lower chamber. The invasion assay was conducted as
described for migration assay by using 1.5  105 cells and
Matrigel-coated membrane (24-well insert; pore size, 8 mm; BD
Biosciences). After 24 hours of incubation, cells remaining on
top of the membrane and not migrating were removed by
using a cotton swab. Migrated cells on the lower surface of the
membrane were stained with Hema 3 Stain (Fisher Scientific),
photographed, and counted.
Chemotherapy and cytotoxicity assays
Etoposide and paclitaxel were from Selleck Chemical;
oxaliplatin was purchased from Sigma Aldrich). Chemoresistance of MMC and ETTM cells was determined by measuring cell viability by using the Xcelligence system (Roche
Applied Science). The instrument measures cell status (given
as cell index) in a form of electrical impedance which is
determined by cell morphology, cell adhesion, and cell
viability. As cells attach to the bottom of the plate coated
with electrodes, a change in local ionic environment occurs
resulting in increased impedance. Measurements were carried out according to the instructions of the supplier. After
seeding 100 mL of suspension of 20,000 MMC and ETTM cells
into the 16-well of the E-plates, the cell index was taken
every 5 minutes for about 18 hours for the cells to reach log
phase. The cells were then exposed to increasing doses of
oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, and etoposide and the cell index read
again for additional 60 hours.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted by using GraphPad Prism
version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software). Two-tailed
Student's t-test, the Mann–Whitney U test, or the 2-way

www.aacrjournals.org

ANOVA was carried out to determine statistically significant
difference. P < 0.05 was considered as significant.

Results
TGFb and TNFa generate mesenchymal tumor cells
with BCSC characteristics
We previously isolated MMCs from tumors developing in
neu-Tg mice (20). We found that MMC cells had epithelial cell
characteristics and rapidly formed tumors when reinjected
into neu-tg mice, but when injected into syngeneic wild-type
mice, showed an immune-mediated initial delay followed by
rapid development of tumors which had undergone EMT and
had lost expression of the neu antigen, generating ANVs (11,
20). We sought to define a culture model of the MMC/ANV
conversion process, and focused on TGFb and TNFa as key
immunologic agents. When MMC cells were cultured with
TGFb and TNFa for extended periods, they were converted to
stable mesenchymal cells (named ETTM cells), showing the
characteristic change in cell morphology from rounded to
elongated, consistent with EMT (Fig. 1A), which was accompanied by loss of expression of the epithelial marker, Ecadherin, and a gain in expression of mesenchymal markers,
N-cadherin, Snail, Twist, and Zeb1 (Figs. 1A–C). At earlier time
points of treatment with TGFb/TNFa, the cells showed an
intermediate phenotype (named MMCTT cells) where
although the cells had acquired mesenchymal features, gene
expression analysis by immunoblot, RT-PCR, and flow cytometry showed only a partial loss of E-cadherin and partial gain
of N-cadherin suggesting incomplete EMT (Figs. 1A and B).
Although removal of TGFb/TNFa from the culture media led
to reversion of MMCTT cells to an epithelial phenotype
(named MCTTE cells), the ETTM cells showed a complete
and stable conversion. To assess the ability of ETTM cells to
redifferentiate in vivo, they were injected into neu-tg mice and
after tumor formation, removed and reassessed for expression
of EMT markers. We found that the tumors expressed both Eand N-cadherin indicating that, despite the stable culture
phenotype, they were able to reestablish heterogeneous
tumors with epithelial characteristics. Interestingly, the cells
isolated from these tumors, when replated in culture, readily
reverted to a mesenchymal phenotype (i.e., N-cadherin positive and E-cadherin negative), similar to the injected ETTM
cells suggesting that the cells possess both the ability to
differentiate into E-cadherin expressing epithelial cells as well
as maintaining strong self-renewal capacity (Fig. 1D).
TGFb/TNFa-mediated EMT was further confirmed by
evaluating EMT genes by PCR pathway analysis. The results
showed differential expression of EMT genes including
higher levels of Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a2, MMP9, and MMP3,
whereas epithelial genes like Ocln, Erbb3, Tspan13, and Bmp7
were reduced in ETTM cells (Fig. 1E). Overall, these results
show exposure of MMC tumor cells to TGFb, and TNFa
results in the generation of stable mesenchymal cells capable of reestablishing heterogeneous tumors with epithelial
characteristics.
Because EMT induction by overexpression of Snail, Twist,
or K-ras resulted in generation of cell populations with BCSC

characteristics in prior studies, we questioned whether TGFb/
TNFa-generated mesenchymal cells also have these BCSC
characteristics, such as enhanced self-renewal, a CD24/lowþ
CD44 phenotype, ability to potently establish heterogeneous
tumor, and resistance to chemotherapy (7, 11, 12). Selfrenewal was examined by assessing for an increased ability
of the MMCTT (incomplete transition) and ETTM cells to
form mammospheres compared with the MMCs. The results
showed that ETTM cells were the most efficient in mammosphere formation, producing more compact and rounded
spheroids than MMCTT cells. MMCs, in contrast, were least
efficient in forming mammospheres (Fig. 2A). Representative
staining for CD24 and CD44 showed that the CD24/lowCD44þ
population within cultures increased with combined TGFb
and TNFa treatment from 33% in the MMCs, to 77% in the

4710

MCTTs, and 100% in the ETTMs (Fig. 2A). The observation
that 33% of MMCs were CD24/lowCD44þ despite a poorer
mammosphere forming efficiency suggests that many of the
CD24-/CD44þ cells are not mammosphere-forming cells,
which is consistent with the work of Al-Hajj and colleagues
also showing that only a subset of human CD24/lowCD44þ
cells are BCSCs (7).
By using the mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumor
cell line, MMCTT, we evaluated the morphology and mammosphere formation efficiency of isolated CD24þ/CD44þ
and CD24/CD44þ subpopulations to confirm that the
mesenchymal and self-renewing phenotype is associated
with the CD24/CD44þ subset. Results in Figure 2B show
that only CD24/CD44þ cells had a mesenchymal phenotype and effectively formed mammospheres (Fig 2b).

A recently identified molecular subtype of breast cancer,
claudin-low, is associated with increased expression of
mesenchymal markers and correlates with poor prognosis
(21, 22). Additionally, residual subpopulations of breast cancer
cells that evade chemo- and endocrine therapy, in humans,
have a claudin-low and BCSC phenotype characterized
by reduced levels of claudin 3, 4, and 7, enrichment of
CD24/lowCD44þ cells, and increased expression of stem
cell-related genes (23). Parallel to these studies, we observed
that ETTM cells have considerably reduced expression of
claudin 3, 4, and 7 and the luminal marker KRT18, relative
to the parental MMC tumor cells (Fig. 2D). Furthermore,
pathway analysis showed enriched expression of stem cell-

MCF10A cells with the cytokines for 40 days, giving rise to
MCF10ATT cells. As expected, exposure to TGF and TNF led
to acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype accompanied by

differentially expressed (Fig. 4B), whereas analysis of Hedgehog
and Notch signaling genes identified differential expression of
Wnt6, BMP4, Wnt10a, Gas1, Gli3, Ptchd2, Ptch1 Wisp1, Notch4,
Fosl1, Fzd1, Notch3, and Hey1 (Fig. 4C and D). These observations indicate widespread regulation of stem-associated genes
in ETTM BCSCs. Overall, these observations together show that
TGFb/TNFa mediate EMT leading to the generation of CD24/
CD44þ cells BCSCs with a claudin-low phenotype.
TGFb/TNFa-mediated EMT results in increased tumor
aggressiveness
Mesenchymal BCSCs are known to have increased aggressiveness relative to epithelial tumor cells. Important characteristics include high tumorigenicity nature as well as
enhanced migration, invasion, and chemoresistance (12, 13,
27). Consistent with their mesenchymal phenotype, ETTM
cells showed enhanced migration and invasion compared with
MMCs (Fig 5A). Relative to MMC and MMCTT, ETTM cells
were also much more tumorigenic than the MMCTTs (Fig. 5B).
Furthermore, serial dilution of the ETTM cells showed ability
to form tumors with as low as 100 cells compared with the
MMCs which could only form tumors at high cell numbers
(ref. 11; Fig. 5C).
Human CD24/lowCD44þ BCSCs are known to have a
metastatic gene signature and are associated with a poor
prognosis (28). Analysis of expression of metastasis-associated
genes in ETTM cells revealed higher levels of Ccl7, Mmp13,
Mmp9, Mmp3, Cdh11, Hgf, Mmp10, Ctsk, and Cdh6 as well as
lower levels of Mcam and Tnfsf10, as compared with MMC
(Fig. 5D). In addition, assessment of oncogenes and tumor
suppressor gene expression signatures showed higher expression of S100a4, Tnf, kitlg, P53, Mycn, and Est1 as well as lower
levels of Myb, Serpinb5, Cdh1, and Kit (Fig. 5E). Overall, these
results showed that ETTM cells, like previously reported CSCs,
are substantially more aggressive than their epithelial differentiated counterparts.
ETTM BSCSs are chemoresistant
A clinically important attribute of CSCs is their resistance to
conventional therapies such as chemotherapy (2, 29). Prior
works by us and others have shown that CD24/lowCD44þ
BCSCs have elevated levels of drug pumps and DNA repair
proteins, thereby conferring profound resistance to chemoand radiotherapies (11, 30). To assess the resistance of ETTM
and MMC cells, they were treated with increasing doses of
oxaliplatin, aclitaxel, and etoposide (11) and growth measured
in real-time (31). As shown in Fig. 6A–C, BCSCs generated with
TGFb/TNFa were more resistant to chemotherapy as compared with epithelial MMC.
Analysis of drug resistance genes showed increased expression of ABC transporter genes, Abcb1b, Abcc3, and Abcc5, as
well as resistance genes Hif1a, and Pparg but lower levels of
Erbb3 and Tnfrsf11a (Fig. 6D). Analysis of apoptotic genes
showed higher expression of Bcl2l2, Birc3, and Traf1 genes but
decreased expression of Bcl2, Bcl2l1, Mme5, and Dapk1 (Fig
6E). DNA damage and repair signaling such as P53, Rad9b, and
Rad51L1 were higher whereas Gadd45a, Rad50, and Rad54l1
were lower (Fig. 6F).

ETTM cells show altered expression of breast cancer
and cell survival pathways
A number of signaling pathways including chemokine pathways have a role in breast cancer pathogenesis. Studies have
shown a correlation between chemokine-secreting tumorinfiltrating macrophages and poor prognosis of breast cancer
(32, 33). Assessment of chemokine receptor signaling genes in
ETTM showed increased expression of Ccl13, Cxcr7, Ccl11,
Cxcl12, and Tnf as well as downregulation of Cxcr4 relative to
MMC (Fig. 7A). We also observed higher amounts of inflammatory cytokines and receptor genes Ccl2, Ccl5, Ccl6, Ccl7,
Ccl8, Ccl11, Ccr1, Ccr7, and Il1r1 but lower Ccr3, Cxcl1, Il1f6,
and Ccl20 (Fig. 7B). In breast cancer, expression of estrogen
receptors is both a predictive and prognostic marker as well as
an effective means of targeting hormone-dependent breast
cancers (34). Gene analysis of breast cancer estrogen receptor
signaling identified differential expression of Thbs2, Serpine1,
Serpineb5, Cldn7, Krt18, and Kit genes (Fig. 7C). Cell cycle
regulators are implicated in cancer initiation, progression, and
resistance to therapy, and were also found to be differentially
expressed in ETTM (Fig. 7D; ref. 35). Finally, higher levels of
angiogenesis genes were observed with generation of ETTM
cells (Fig. 7E). The results of these gene expression analyses of
breast cancer and cell survival-associated pathways supports
the genotype and phenotype of the ETTM cells as BCSCs.

Discussion
The key BCSC characteristics are increased tumorigenicity,
ability to reconstitute a heterogeneous tumor, self-renewal,
and resistance to therapies. We have shown here that treatment of epithelial MMCs with TGFb/TNFa generates stable
mesenchymal BCSCs, which have increased expression of
mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin, Snail, Slug, Twist,
Zeb1, Mmp3, and Mmp9. Different cancer cell lines have
different degrees of sensitivity and resistance to TGFbinduced EMT (36–40). The incomplete and reversible EMT
observed in MMCTT cells, in contrast to complete and stable
ETTMs, generated from the cell epithelial MMC cells present
an intriguing observation, suggesting that although EMT can
begin within a few days of exposure to cytokine, complete
EMT involves not only early regulation of actin cytoskeleton as
evident in cell morphologic changes, but is associated with
regulation of a plethora of genes and activation of an array of
molecular pathways leading to a transformation of epithelial
cells to more migratory and invasive mesenchymal cells. Thus,
EMT may not be a rapid but rather a long-term process
involving regulation of many genes which act in concert to
produce the profound observed cellular, molecular, phenotypic, and functional changes.
The generation of BCSCs by treatment with TGFb/TNFa
suggests that factors secreted by the immune system play an
important role in breast cancer progression, which is consistent with our prior in vivo studies (11). It also implicates
inflammation-induced EMT in cancer metastases and recurrence. TGFb is a potent growth inhibitor which normally
functions to regulate aberrant growth of epithelial and
hematopoietic cells (41). However, TGFb can also induce

Breast cancer and estrogen receptor
signaling genes

Figure 7. Breast cancer and stem cell-associated genes are regulated in ETTM cells. qPCR analysis of chemokine receptor genes (A), inflammatory cytokine

subvert immune-mediated elimination, thereby permitting
long-term survival, which would be consistent with long-term
recurrence risk among treated breast cancer patients.

understanding how to inhibit the growth and regeneration
of BCSCs (43). Identification of cell surface markers
of BCSCs for accurate identification and isolation is essential if BCSC research is to make an impact in patient
care. In addition, identification of functionally relevant
biological targets for development of monoclonal antibodies or small molecule inhibitors to target BCSCs in combination with conventional treatments could provide the
breakthrough needed to minimize metastatic recurrence of
breast cancer.
We observed upregulation of signaling pathways linked to
stem cells including Homeobox, hedgehog, TGFb/BMP,
Notch, and chemokine and chemokine receptors. These pathways are subjects of ongoing research to identify possible
targets. Chemoresistance to cytotoxic drugs such as oxaliplatin, etoposide, and paclitaxel is a crucial property of CSCs
which is central to their survival and evasion. The robust
chemoresistant and regulation of genes and pathways associated with stemness and survival underscores the major
problem posed by CSCs, specifically their ability to be eradicated with existing therapeutic modalities.
There is increasing evidence of the importance of EMT in
the generation of the claudin-low subtype (22). The claudinlow subtype is a recent addition to the 4 major subtypes of
breast cancer, namely luminal A, luminal B, basal like, and
ERBB2 positive subtypes (44). This new subtype exhibits stem
cell characteristics with increased expression of immune
response genes, EMT genes, and lower expression of luminal
differentiation genes (45). The claudin-low subtype also constitutes the residual subpopulation of breast cancer cells that
survived after chemo- and endocrine therapy and are enriched
in CD24/low/CD44þ cells (23). Our results show that TGFb/
TNFa treatment of breast cancer cells with a predominant
luminal phenotype results in generation of the claudin-low

cells and suggests that targeting proteins involved in the
induction or survival of this subtype could be a therapeutic
strategy for improving survival of breast cancer patients
regardless of the primary subtype.
In conclusion, this study provides new information on the
role of the cytokines, TGFb and TNFa in EMT. It also provides
initial evidence linking immunity (i.e., cytokines) to the generation of the BCSC through EMT. The ex vivo generation of
BCSCs cells with cytokines may enable a better understanding
of the biology of CSC, identification of definitive biomarkers,
and the discovery of biological targets and pathways for
development of effective therapies. It could also be useful
for drug screening to determine the effectiveness and required
doses of CSC-targeted therapies.
