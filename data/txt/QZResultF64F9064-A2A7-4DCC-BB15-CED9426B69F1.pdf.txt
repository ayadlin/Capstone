ABSTRACT
In recent years, not only has the role of miRNAs in cancer become increasingly
clear but also their utilization as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets has
gained ground. Although the importance of dietary stilbenes such as resveratrol and
pterostilbene as anti-cancer agents is well recognized, our understanding of their
miRNA-targeting capabilities is still limited. In our previous study, we reported that
resveratrol downregulates PTEN-targeting members of the oncogenic miR-17 family,
which are overexpressed in prostate cancer. This study investigates the resveratrol and
pterostilbene induced miRNA-mediated regulation of PTEN in prostate cancer. Here, we
show that both compounds decrease the levels of endogenous as well as exogenously
expressed miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106b thereby upregulating their target PTEN.
Using functional luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrate that ectopically expressed
miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106b directly target PTEN 3’UTR to reduce its expression,
an effect rescued upon treatment with resveratrol and pterostilbene. Moreover, while
stable lentiviral expression of miR-17/106a significantly decreased PTEN mRNA and
protein levels and conferred survival advantage to the cells, resveratrol and more so
pterostilbene was able to dramatically suppress these effects. Further, pterostilbene
through downregulation of miR-17-5p and miR-106a-5p expression both in tumors
and systemic circulation, rescued PTEN mRNA and protein levels leading to reduced
tumor growth in vivo. Our findings implicate dietary stilbenes as an attractive miRNAmediated chemopreventive and therapeutic strategy, and circulating miRNAs as
potential chemopreventive and predictive biomarkers for clinical development in
prostate cancer.

of the mechanisms of miRNA action has considerably
increased. In general, miRNAs bind to sequences in
the 3′UTR (3′ untranslated region) of target genes and
decrease the stability of nascent mRNA or /and protein
translation, which results in decreased production of the
target protein [6].
Most importantly, miRNAs have a number of
desirable characteristics for clinical application: disease
specificity, exceptional stability in various types of clinical

samples, and ability to respond to therapy [7]. These
features together with presence of circulating miRNAs in
cell-free fraction of blood, i.e. serum and plasma, make
miRNAs incomparable potential biomarkers for cancer
diagnosis, prediction, and prognosis, which in turn, mark
them as valuable targets for the clinical development of
anticancer agents [7–9].
In prostate cancer, changes in expression of
miRNAs are associated with clinicopathological
parameters such as Gleason score and recurrence
[8, 10–12]. In particular, there is an overexpression
and amplification of oncogenic miR-17~92 and
miR-106b~25 clusters in prostate cancer [10, 13, 14].
We too, using miRNA profiling in LNCaP cells, reported
significant expression of oncogenic miR-17~92,
miR-106a~363, and miR-106b~25 clusters, some
members of which target the tumor suppressor gene
PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog) [15]. PTEN
is frequently defective in prostate cancer as its deletions/
mutations are found in primary and metastatic disease
[16]. It was speculated that PTEN heterozygosity, when
accompanied by miRNA-mediated down-regulation,
might be more effective at promoting tumorigenesis
than complete homozygous loss of PTEN [17]. Since
homozygous PTEN deletion is not common in human
prostate cancer, the role of epigenetic regulators, such
as miRNAs, becomes more important in contributing
to PTEN expression and activity. This, in turn, opens
the door for potential epigenetic therapies, including
dietary compounds with the ability to modulate PTEN
abundance by suppressing oncogenic miRNAs.
Our knowledge of anticancer therapies,
especially dietary compounds that can control aberrant
miRNA expression is relatively limited [18, 19].
Dietary stilbenes, such as resveratrol (Res) (trans-3,
5, 4′-trihydroxystilbene) and its potent natural
analog pterostilbene (Pter) (trans-3, 5-dimethoxy4′-hydroxystilbene), are known for their antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective and anticancer
activities [20–22]. Both compounds have pleiotropic
anticancer activities that include induction of apoptosis
and inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis [23–31].
Since miRNAs regulate all aspects of cancer biology, one
mechanism of anticancer effects of dietary stilbenes may
as well be through modulation of miRNAs.
We previously showed that resveratrol significantly
altered miRNA profiles in prostate cancer, including
members of the oncogenic miR-17 family, predicted to
target PTEN [15]. Upregulation of PTEN protein levels
by resveratrol in prostate cancer have been reported
earlier [15, 32]. One mechanism of PTEN upregulation
by resveratrol, reported by us recently, is inhibition
of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1)-mediated
deacetylation and inactivation of PTEN [27]. However,
the role of dietary stilbenes such as resveratrol and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pterostilbene in modulating miRNA-mediated regulation
of PTEN in prostate cancer has not been investigated.
In the current study, we hypothesized an
oncomiR-mediated inhibition of PTEN and provided
experimental validation on the ability of resveratrol and
pterostilbene to rescue this effect. Our results indicate that
both resveratrol and pterostilbene exert their anticancer
effects, at least in part, via repression of several members
of the oncogenic miR-17 family. We show that by
inhibiting these oncomiRs, resveratrol and pterostilbene
rescue the expression of PTEN tumor suppressor. This
is the first report on dietary stilbenes’ miRNA-mediated
regulation of PTEN in prostate cancer.

RESULTS
Resveratrol rescues miR-mediated downregulation of PTEN in prostate cancer cells
Previous report from our laboratory showed
that the expression levels of miRs from oncogenic
miR-17~92, miR-106a~363 and miR-106b~25 clusters
were downregulated in LNCaP and DU145 PCa cells
treated with 50 μM resveratrol [15]. Based on their seed
sequences, the miRNAs of these clusters are grouped
into four families, one of which is the miR-17 family
that consists of miR-17, miR-20a and b, miR-106a and
b and miR-93 [33]. According to miRanda/MicroCosm
[34], TargetScan [35] and Diana-microT-CDS [36]
prediction algorithms, miRs-17, -20a and -106a and
b target tumor suppressor PTEN gene. Independently,
we observed an upregulation of PTEN protein
levels in DU145 and 22Rv1 cells [15, 27] leading to
downregulation of PI3K-Akt signaling by resveratrol [27]
and hypothesized that this effect could be regulated, at
least in part, by resveratrol-modulation of PTEN-targeting
miRNAs. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that
both resveratrol and its natural analog pterostilbene
significantly downregulated miRs-17, -20a, -106a and
-106b in DU145 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells that
express wild type PTEN (Figure 1A).
To establish a direct effect of resveratrol on
miRNAs, we examined whether resveratrol regulates
ectopically expressed miRs in prostate cancer cells.
Resveratrol treatment decreased ectopic miRNA
expression similar to its effect on endogenous
miRNA (Figure 1B). Further, ectopic overexpression
of miRs -17 or -20a or -106b alone resulted in
downregulation of their target PTEN mRNA and protein
in DU145 cells, which was rescued by treatment with
50 μM of resveratrol (Figure 1C and 1D). Cumulatively,
these results suggest that resveratrol’s rescue of PTEN
mRNA and protein is mediated, at least in part, through its
ability to downregulate oncomiRs of the miR-17 family
involved in targeting PTEN.

Resveratrol and pterostilbene reverse targeting
of PTEN 3′UTR by oncomiRs

(Figure 2D) significantly suppressed the luciferase activity,
indicating that these miRs directly target the 3′UTR of
PTEN. When cells were treated with either resveratrol
or pterostilbene, there was a reversal of miRs’ inhibitory
effects with wild type 3′UTR (Figure 2B and 2C) and no
changes with mutant 3′UTR (Figure 2D). These results
indicated that stilbenes can reverse the targeting of PTEN
3′UTR by these miRNAs.

To validate whether PTEN is a direct target gene
of miRs-17, -20a and -106b, we employed the dualluciferase reporter assay. For this, PTEN 3′UTR sequence
(535 bp) (Supplementary Figure S1) containing either the
wild type seed match for all three miRs (GCACTTT) or
its mutant (mut) form (GGAGTAT) was amplified and
cloned into the pMIRGLO vector, downstream of the
luciferase reporter gene. The overall target specificity
for miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106b defined by miRanda
(http://www.microrna.org) was comparable for these three
miRs (Figure 2A). The data showed that the co-expression

referred here after as miR-17/106a MIMIC
(Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). Stable
overexpression of miR-17/106a caused a significant
downregulation of  PTEN mRNA and protein levels
(Figure  3A). Moreover, resveratrol efficiently
downregulated the levels of ectopically expressed
miRs (Figure 3B) resulting in rescue of PTEN mRNA
(Figure 3C) and protein (Figure 3D). As seen in Figures
3C and 3D, pterostilbene demonstrated marginally stronger
effect in restoring both PTEN mRNA and protein levels.
In addition, we observed that overexpression of miRs
confers survival advantage to these cells, and the inhibitory
effects of both agents on cell growth were more pronounced
in miR-17/106a MIMIC cells compared to empty vector
(EV) control (Supplementary Figure S2C).These results
suggested that the stilbenes rescue PTEN expression by
downregulation of miR-17-5p and miR-106a-5p.

Meta-analysis for correlation of miR-17 and -106a
expression in prostate cancer samples [37] clearly
indicated a significant overexpression of these miRs
in prostate cancer patients compared to normal cohort
(Supplementary Figure S3) indicating their clinical
significance in PCa and therefore the therapeutic value of
targeting these miRNAs. In preclinical studies, to examine
the miR-mediated anticancer efficacy of pterostilbene
in vivo, we implanted DU145-Luc EV and miR-17/106a
overexpressing cells on the right flank of male nude
mice and treated them with vehicle (10% DMSO) or
pterostilbene (50 mg/kg bw). We chose pterostilbene
based on its better effects on miR downregulation

leading to PTEN rescue (Figure 1A, Figure 3C, 3D) and
its known potent pharmacokinetics including superior
bioavailability and more effective tissue distribution
over resveratrol [22, 30, 38–42]. Tumor growth was
monitored weekly by both bioluminescent imaging
and caliper measurements, which complemented each
other, until day 39 when mice were sacrificed and
tumors and sera collected for analysis (Figure 4A).
Tumor measurements by bioluminescent imaging in the
first 18 days clearly revealed that ectopic expression
of miR-17/106a promotes tumorigenic properties of
cells as evident by accelerated tumor progression and
larger tumor volumes in miR-17/106a overexpressing
xenografts as compared to the EV group (Figure 4B).
Although still not reaching statistical significance at
that time, miR-17/106a vehicle-treated tumors exhibited
steady growth but revealed non-consistent measurements
due to limitations of photon emission detection of large
s.c. tumors that consist of necrotic areas and infiltrating

host cells [31, 43–45]. On the other hand, caliper-based
measurements were feasible only after day 18, after
which they were more reliable than bioluminescent
measurements and demonstrated statistically significant
differences between miR-overexpressing tumors and
EV by day 39 (Figure 4C). Importantly, pterostilbene
treatment significantly decelerated tumor growth in miR17/106a overexpressing xenografts without any obvious
adverse effects on mice (Supplementary Figure S4A).
Pterostilbene treatment downregulated miRs-17 and 106a
more efficiently in miR-17/106a overexpressing tumors
(Figure 4D) while simultaneously enhancing PTEN mRNA
(Figure 4E) and protein expression by approximately
three fold (Figure 4F). Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed a decrease in PTEN expression along with a
five-fold increase in Ki-67 and a three-fold decrease
in cleaved Caspase-3 staining in miR-overexpressed
tumors compared to that in controls (Figure 5A and 5B).

reversed these effects and demonstrated more potent
effects in miR-overexpressing tumors (Figure 5A and 5B).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that pterostilbene
could target overexpressed miR levels and still restore
PTEN expression leading to a decrease in tumor growth.
A number of studies have assessed the potential
of circulating miRNAs to diagnose early-stage prostate
cancer [7–9]. The ability of circulating miRNAs as
predictors to treatment response or as chemopreventive
markers is understudied. We questioned whether
pterostilbene can diminish the abundance of secreted
miRNAs and whether detection of changes in circulating
miRs in response to treatment may be useful in the
future clinical applications. To this end, we analyzed
the relative abundance of circulating miR-17 and -106a
in the sera from both groups of xenografts treated with
pterostilbene. First of all, miR-17-5p and miR-106a-5p
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

were highly expressed in sera collected from mice
that were injected with miR-17/106a MIMIC cells
compared to those that were carrying EV MIMIC cells
(Supplementary  Figure  S4B). The results shown in
Figure  5C indicated that in response to pterostilbene
treatment reduction in circulating miR-17-5p and
miR-106a-5p were more prominent in sera from ectopic
miR-expressing xenografts compared to their control
counterparts. This implied that beneficial anticancer
effects of pterostilbene may be reflected through changes
in levels of circulating miRs detected in serum.

From a therapeutic perspective, dietary agents are
being intensively studied for their anticancer properties.

are focusing on bioactive dietary factors-induced
beneficial changes in gene expression through epigenetic
modifications [46]. Several studies have recently
highlighted the anti-cancer role of dietary compounds
via their effect on microRNAs aberrantly expressed
in malignant cells [18, 19, 47]. An initial large scale
miRnome analysis of lung, breast, stomach, prostate,
colon and pancreatic tumors revealed high expression
of miR-17 and miR -20a among others [2]. Among these
oncomiRs, miR-17~92 cluster, described as oncomiR 1
has been shown to be overexpressed in several cancers
[48]. We detected significantly increased expression of
miRs-17, -20a, -106a and -106b and the ability of dietary
resveratrol to downregulate these oncomiRs in miRNA
profiling studies of prostate cancer cells [15].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our current work expands on these initial findings
by demonstrating direct association between oncomiRs
and their target, functional involvement of miRNAs in
tumor manifestation, and, importantly, the ability of
resveratrol and its potent analog pterostilbene to reverse
silencing effects of miRNAs on tumor suppressor PTEN.
Although oncogenic potential of miR-17~92 and
miR-106b~25 clusters in targeting 3′UTR of PTEN mRNA
has been recently reported [13, 48], we investigated
the ability of resveratrol and pterostilbene to counteract
oncomiRs. Indeed, while ectopic overexpression of
miRs  -17, -20a and -106a induced a significant loss in
PTEN 3′UTR luciferase activity with miR-17 revealing most
striking down-regulation, both resveratrol and pterostilbene
rescued this loss of luciferase signal in a dose-dependent

Proof-of concept in vivo studies using miR-17/106a
overexpressing tumor cells clearly showed accelerated
tumor development in immunocompromised mice that
was efficiently counteracted upon pterostilbene treatment,
which resulted in enhanced PTEN expression and
apoptosis. This provides substantial preclinical evidence
for the therapeutic ability of dietary stilbenes in regulating
tumor development and progression via miR-mediated
mechanisms.
Finally, to further potentiate the importance of our
finding for relevance to clinical application, we determined
the changes in circulating levels of miRs-17 and -106a
from sera of tumor bearing mice. We found a three-fold
higher expression of these tumor-derived oncomiRs in the
sera of miR-overexpressing mice compared to their empty
vector counterparts, which was efficiently downregulated
by pterostilbene. Detection of serum circulating miRNAs
in prostate cancer animal models and clinical cohorts
of prostate cancer patients has been reported [7–9, 53],
however, the regulation of circulating miRs in serum
by dietary compounds has not been investigated. In this
report, we demonstrated that pterostilbene treatment not
only leads to reduction of tumor growth but also affects
the levels of circulating miRs, which can be utilized as
chemopreventive and predictive markers in prostate
cancer.
In conclusion, we show here that high miRs-17,
-20a, -106a and -106b expression is strongly correlated
with prostate cancer progression, and confirm PTEN
tumor suppressor as a key target of these oncomiRs
in prostate cancer cells. Importantly, we demonstrate
oncomiR-mediated anticancer effects of resveratrol
and pterostilbene, which suggest that restoring PTEN
expression may be a feasible approach for prostate cancer
chemoprevention and therapy (Figure 5D). To the best
of our knowledge, our study is the first to address the
functional consequences of onco-miRNA downregulation
by dietary pterostilbene in vivo. Also, for the first time,
we demonstrate the modulation of circulating oncomiRs
in murine serum in response to treatment by natural
agent, which opens possibilities for miRNA utilization
as chemopreventive biomarkers in prostate cancer. These
findings provide a novel perspective on how dietary
stilbenes may function as chemopreventive and anticancer
agents by modulating miRNAs, alterations of which can
be responsible for prostate cancer predisposition and
progression.

manner, indicating that there is a direct effect of treatment
on ectopically overexpressed miRNAs. As expected, the
inhibitory effect of resveratrol and pterostilbene treatment on
these oncomiRs was reflected in the elevated PTEN mRNA
and protein expression levels.
Of note, resveratrol diminished the abundance
of ectopically overexpressed oncomiRs in transiently
transfected DU145 cells almost with the same potency
as it did the endogenous expression of miRs-17
and -20a, indicating that there could be a possible
affinity of resveratrol for a pool of oncomiRs, which are
overexpressed in a system such as in transformed cells.
This hypothesis is attested by our findings of relatively
higher abundance of these oncomiRs and their better
targeting by resveratrol in DU145 prostate cancer cells
compared to “normal” RWPE-1 cells (data not shown).
Since commercially available synthetic miRNAs are
described as pre-miRs, which after introduction in the
cellular system undergo processing by Dicer to generate
mature miRNAs, it is plausible that resveratrol acts either
directly on mature miRNAs and/or on the molecular
substrates responsible for generating the mature miRNAs.
There are evidence in literature for both possibilities.
Hagiwara et al., have shown that resveratrol and more
so pterostilbene enhances the transcriptional activation
of certain tumor suppressive miRNAs and Argonaute-2
(Ago-2), a key regulator of miRNA homeostasis and
biogenesis [49]. On the other hand, direct interaction of
resveratrol with mature miRNAs, which could potentially
alter their interaction with the target mRNA, was reported
recently by Baselga-Escudero and colleagues [50]. No
data is available on regulation of Dicer, Drosha or other
miRNA machinery-related genes by dietary compounds
in prostate cancer. We believe that there is a possibility
for stilbenes to regulate other microRNA processing
components including Dicer, which have been shown to
be upregulated in prostate cancer [10, 51], subsequently
diminishing cellular pools of oncomiRs. However,
based on the differential effect of resveratrol on the
expression of oncomiRs (downregulation) and tumor
suppressor miRNAs (upregulation), it would be safe to
assume that the specificity of the resveratrol-mediated
downregulation of miR-17 family could come from
resveratrol’s regulation of some transcription factor(s)
that regulate the transcription of these miRNA genes
(unpublished data).
The more potent anticancer properties of
pterostilbene can be explained by its chemical structure
differences from resveratrol where two hydroxyl groups
of resveratrol are replaced by two methoxy groups,
which makes pterostilbene more stable, lipophilic and
membrane-permeable [52]. We and others have reported
earlier a more effective inhibition of prostate tumor
cell growth in vitro and in vivo by pterostilbene, and
essentially, greater accumulation of pterostilbene in serum
and tissues compared to resveratrol [30, 38–41].

repeat profiling at Research Technology Support Facility,
Michigan State University in July 2014. Resveratrol and
pterostilbene treatment were carried out as previously
described [28–31].

DU145-Luc cells were stably transduced
with commercially available miRIDIAN shMIMIC
lentiviral microRNA particles expressing miR-17/106a
(hsa-miR-106a miRIDIAN shMIMIC), termed as miR17/106a MIMIC and Empty shMIMIC lentiviral particles,
termed as EV MIMIC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
USA). MiR-17 and miR-106a share the same seed
sequence except for a cytosine residue in miR-17replaced
by an adenine in miR-106a at the 5′ end. The plasmid is
based on the pSMART vector with a puromycin selection
and GFP cassette. Cells were transduced using OptiMEM
medium (Life Technologies, NY, USA) which contained
6 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, Indianapolis, USA)
with lentiviral particles at multiplicity of infection
(MOI) = 8. On day 4 post-transduction, puromycin
(Sigma-Aldrich, Indianapolis, USA) selection was
initiated and GFP-positive clones were selected using
cloning cylinders. Cells were plated in 24-well plates
for expansion and propagated at a final concentration of
200 μg/ml puromycin.

Cloning and dual- luciferase reporter assay
We amplified a 535 bp region of the PTEN 3′UTR
encompassing the miR-17, -20a and -106b seed sequence
and cloned into the Sac I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
USA) site of pMIRGLO vector (Promega, Madison,
USA) downstream of the Firefly luciferase gene using the
InFusion HD cloning kit (Clontech, Mountain View, USA).
The orientation of the insert was verified by sequencing
(Davis Sequencing). To introduce three-point mutations
into the seed sequence of the miRs binding site, we used
the InFusion mutagenesis method (Clontech, Mountain
View, USA) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The wild
type primers used were as follows: forward, 5′- CTA GTT
GTT TAA ACG AGC TCT CTG ACA CCA CTG ACT
CTG ATC CA- 3′; reverse, 5′- GAC TCG AGG CTA
GCG AGC TCA GTA GGC TTT GAA GGA CAG CAG
GA- 3′ (bold letters represent Sac I cloning site). The
mutated primers used were as follows: forward, 5′ -GGA
TTA ATA AAG ATG GGA GTA TCC CG- 3′; reverse, 5′
-TTT CTG AGC ATT CCC TCC ATT CCC- 3′ (underlined
indicates mutated nucleotides). Luciferase reporter assay
was performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega, Madison, USA). After cells were
co-transfected with either wild type or mutant 3′UTR
PTEN (800 ng) and 50 nM synthetic Pre-miRs -17 or -20a
or -106b or with non-targeting miR Negative #1 (miR-NC,
negative control, Life Technologies, NY, USA) treated
with resveratrol/pterostilbene, luciferase activity was
measured on a Synergy 4 plate reader (Biotek Instruments).
Firefly luciferase activity was normalized for transfection
efficiency to Renilla luciferase activity. The ratio of PTEN
3′UTR alone to Empty Vector (EV) alone (3′UTR/EV)
was set as control (Ctrl = 1) and all changes in luciferase
activity were calculated relative to Ctrl.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
RNA was isolated from DU145 and 22Rv1 cells
using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as previously
described [15]. Real-time PCR was performed using
custom primers specific for hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR20a, hsa-miR106a-5p, hsa-miR-106b and miRCURY
LNA™ Universal RT microRNA PCR kit (Exiqon,
Vedbaek, Denmark). SNORD44 was used an internal
reference. Specific PrimeTime™ human PTEN primers
were used: forward 5′-GAACTTGTCTTCCCGTCGT-3′
and reverse 5′-AATGTTCAGTGGCGGAACT-3′
(Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, USA). For
estimation of tumor-derived circulating miRNAs in
murine serum, miRNA isolation was performed with
50 μl of sera. Each sample was spiked with 5 nM of
Cel-miR-39 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville,
USA) from Caenorhabditis elegans as an internal
reference control (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark). Fold
changes in miRNA/mRNA expression was estimated by
the 2-ΔΔCt method [55].

Western blot
Whole-cell lysis was performed as previously
described [15, 27]. The membranes were probed
with anti-PTEN (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Danvers,
USA) and anti-β-actin antibodies (1:2500, Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies, Dallas, USA). Signals were visualized
using the SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescence kit

GEO database analysis

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and imaged on
a Chemidoc gel imager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Images
were quantified using the Image J software (NIH).

The data related to GSE21036 were acquired from
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website. We used
the Bioconductor and GEO query package to access
the expression data, platform and clinical data of the
study. The expression data were log2-transformed and
processed by the between-array variance stabilization
normalization. The expression levels of given microRNA
were summarized by boxplot in the tumor and normal
sample subgroups separately.

Cell viability assay
Proliferation of cells treated with resveratrol and
pterostilbene was determined by MTT (Sigma-Aldrich,
Indianapolis, USA) assay as described [56]. Absorbance
of the formazan was measured using Synergy-4 plate
reader after 72 h of treatment. IC50 values were calculated
by the linear interpolation method using MS Excel.

Statistical analysis

Prostate cancer xenografts

The differences between groups were analyzed
by the two-sample two-tailed Student’s t test. For
animal studies, one-way ANOVA was used to assess
the difference in mean among given groups. Levene’s
test was performed to test equal-variance assumption.
The Welch’s one-way ANOVA method was used when
unequal variances were present. The pairwise comparison
was conducted when significant differences in mean were
verified. Bonferroni adjusted p values were reported
in pairwise comparisons. Statistical significance was
set as p ≤ 0.05. All data are cumulative of at least three
independent experiments.

Fox n1nu/nu male mice were purchased from Harlan
Laboratory at seven weeks of age. Housing and care
of all animals were in accordance with the guidelines
established by the University’s Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. Upon arrival, all animals were given
a phytoestrogen-free AIN-76A diet (Research Diets,
New Brunswick, USA) ad libitum. Mice were randomly
divided into two groups of 16 mice each for both cells
lines. 2 x 106 DU145-Luc EV MIMIC or miR-17/106a
MIMIC cells in combination with 50% matrigel (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, USA, total volume 200 μl) were
inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) on the dorsal right flank
of mice. On day 4, bioluminescence was measured in all
animals and based on the total flux signal intensities, mice
in each group were randomized into two subgroups each
(n = 8): vehicle (10% DMSO) and treated with pterostilbene
(50 mg/kg bw). Intraperitoneal injections (i.p.) were
performed daily, 5 days a week, for 39 days. Bioluminescent
and caliper measurements were taken weekly as previously
described [29–31]. Calculation of tumor volume by digital
Vernier caliper measurements were done by using formula
as before [29, 31]. The mice were sacrificed at day 39 and
tumors were excised. Total RNA and protein were isolated
and the remaining tissue was placed in 10% formalin for
histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis.
Blood was also collected at sacrifice, and serum samples
were stored at -80°C until further analysis.
