ABSTRACT
Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of malignancy in long-term dialysis
patients and kidney transplant recipients in Taiwan. mTORCs (mammalian target of
rapamycin complexes) and EGF are important in urothelial carcinoma. To identify the
regulation of mTORCs upon EGF stimulation is necessary. mTOR integrates signals
from growth factors via mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).
The mechanism of mTORC1 action has been widely studied; however, the regulation of
mTORC2 has not been well studied. Here, we demonstrate that Gab1 is an important
upstream regulator in EGF-mediated activation of mTORCs. In our study, we confirm
that mTORCs translocate from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane via the PH
domain of Gab1 upon EGF stimulation. Moreover, Gab1 associates with mTORCs. This
association stabilizes the integrity of mTORCs and induces mTORC activity. Compared
to normal bladder tissue, the expression of Gab1 and activity of mTORCs are elevated
in urothelial carcinoma. Collectively, our results suggest that Gab1 is an essential
regulator of the EGF-mediated mTORC pathways and may potentially be used as a
biomarker for urothelial carcinoma to predict diagnosis and drug response.

Accordingly, mTOR is important in urothelial carcinoma
and identification of the mechanism of mTOR regulation
in urothelial carcinoma is necessary.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a
serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a critical role in the
downstream networks of many growth factor receptors [3, 4].
Two major regulators of the mTOR complex (mTORC)
signaling pathways are mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1

INTRODUCTION
Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of
malignancy in long-term dialysis patients and kidney
transplant recipients in Taiwan [1]. Recently, we
demonstrate that rapamycin, the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, exhibits potent anti-tumor
properties against BBN-induced urothelial carcinoma [2].

is rapamycin-sensitive and contains mTOR, raptor and
mLST8, while mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8
and sin1 [5]. mTORC1 promotes mRNA translation via
p70S6K to regulate protein synthesis and cell metabolism
[6]. mTORC2 plays an important role in phosphorylation
and subsequent activation of AKT to promote cell survival
and proliferation [7–9].
It is known that mTORC1 is regulated by activation
of PI3K, AKT, Rheb and inhibition of tuberous sclerosis
protein 1/2 (TSC1-TSC2); however, the regulatory
mechanisms of mTORC2 have not been completely
elucidated [10]. PI3K plays a crucial role in mTORC2
activation. In an in vitro mTORC2 kinase assay, mTORC2
was directly activated by PI3K-phosphatidylinositol-3,
4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in HEK293T cells [11].
Ribosomes induced by insulin associate with mTORC2
and lead to activation of mTORC2 [12]. Recently, we
demonstrated that mTORC2-dependent AKT activation
in a rat model of urothelial carcinoma is a consequence
of mTORC1 inhibition [2]. mTORC1 activates p70S6K
to phosphorylate rictor at Thr1135, leading to a reduction
in mTORC2 activity [13]. Indeed, mTORC1 also plays
an important role in mTORC2 regulation. ER stress
activates GSK3β to phosphorylate rictor at Ser1235
and subsequently reduces mTORC2 activity [14]. In
addition to phosphorylation of rictor, phosphorylation
of sin1 attenuates mTORC2 activity. p70S6K and AKT
induce phosphorylation of sin1 on Thr86 and Thr398
to dissociate sin1 from the mTORC2 complex [15].
According to these studies, the phosphorylation of rictor
and sin1 appears to inhibit the activity of mTORC2;
however, the role of the phosphorylation sites on rictor
and sin1 remains unclear. The small GTPase Rac1
regulates both mTORC1 and mTORC2 in response to
growth factor stimulation. Rac1 binds directly to mTOR
independently of the GTP-bound state of Rac1 and
mediates membrane localization of mTORCs [16]. The
TSC1-TSC2 complex, a negative regulator of mTORC1,
is required for activation of mTORC2. This complex
associates with mTORC2 but not mTORC1, inhibiting
mTORC1 and activating mTORC2 [17].
Previous reports have shown that epidermal
growth factor (EGF) induce the activation of mTORC2
[18]. Downstream of the EGF receptor (EGFR), Grb2associated binder 1 (Gab1) is a major adaptor protein for
the EGF-mediated signaling pathway [19, 20]. Evidence
suggests that Gab1 may potentially be an important player
in the regulation of mTORC2 after EGF stimulation
[18]. Gab1 belongs to a family of docking proteins that
includes Gab2 and Gab3 [21], and it contains an NH2terminal pleckstrin homology domain, a Met-binding
domain, 3 proline-rich sequences and 16 potential tyrosine
phosphorylation sites that represent Src-homology (SH)
2 domain-binding motifs [19, 21]. The PH domain is
a common structural element in Gab family members

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that can recognize and bind to membrane proteins [22].
Moreover, the PH domain of Gab1 binds to PIP3, and
is responsible for its membrane localization. It has been
reported that the PH domain of Gab1 appears to be
required for Gab1 protein function [23–25]. A PH domain
deletion mutant of Gab1 is defective in EGFR and c-MET
signaling [24].
A high percentage of EGFR-positive cases (up to
50% of cases) were observed in high-grade urothelial
carcinoma [26]. These data suggest that EGFR plays
a crucial role in urothelial carcinoma. However, the
mechanism of Gab1 action in EGF-mediated activation
of mTORC2 is unclear. In the present study, the critical
role for Gab1 in EGF-mediated activation of mTORC
pathways and the importance of Gab1 and mTORCs in
urothelial carcinoma were investigated.

RESULTS
Elevated expression of Gab1 is associated with
increased activation of mTORCs in urothelial
cell carcinoma
Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type
of malignancy in long-term dialysis patients and
kidney transplant recipients in Taiwan [1]. Recently,
we reported significant activation of mTORCs in
urothelial carcinoma [2]. In this study, we used
urothelial carcinoma cells to demonstrate that Gab1
was important for mTORC activation. Here, we
examined the expression of Gab1 in many cells lines
from different grades of urothelial carcinoma. Indeed,
the expression level of Gab1 was found to be weaker
in normal urothelial cell lines (E6, normal) and lowgrade urothelial carcinoma cell lines (RT4, Grade
I; TSGH8301, Grade II) and higher in high-grade
urothelial carcinoma cell lines (J82, T24, Grade III)
(Figure S1A). We then examined human bladder tissues
with urothelial carcinoma (Figure 1A and 1B) and rat
bladder tissues with urothelial carcinoma induced by
0.05% N-butyl- N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN)
(Figure 1C and 1D). As expected, immunohistochemical
staining showed significantly increased expression
of Gab1, phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2481 and
phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 in both human and
rat bladder tumor tissues but not in normal bladder
tissues. Western blot analysis also confirmed these
findings. Not only the mTORC2 activity, the mTORC1
activity (phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 and
phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr389) also significantly
increased in both human and rat bladder tissues.
Furthermore, knockdown of Gab1 inhibited T24 cells
colony formation (Figure S1B) and migration (Figure
S1C). Taken together, our results indicate that both Gab1
and mTORCs are important in urothelial carcinoma.

Gab1 is important for plasma membrane

membrane translocation of mTOR and raptor after EGF
stimulation (Figure 3A). In contrast, expression of a Gab1
mutant lacking the PH domain (Gab1ΔPH) or treatment
with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 suppressed membrane
translocation of both proteins after EGF stimulation (Figure
3A). Interestingly, mTORC2 showed the same result upon
EGF stimulation (Figure 2B and 3B). These findings provide
evidence demonstrating that Gab1 regulates mTORCs by
translocating to the plasma membrane after EGF stimulation.

In the EGFR signaling pathway, Gab1 is a major
downstream docking protein triggered by EGF [19, 20].
After EGF stimulation, Gab1 translocates to the plasma
membrane and activates downstream signaling pathways
[23]. Moreover, mTORC2 is directly activated by PIP3 in
HEK293T cells [11]. In the current study, we used Gab1
siRNA to knock down endogenous Gab1 in T24 cells, and
we found that mTOR and raptor could not translocate to
the plasma membrane after EGF stimulation (Figure 2A).
Next, we overexpressed exogenous Gab1 in E6 cells, which
have lower levels of Gab1 expression compared to T24
cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of green fluorescent
protein-fused Gab1 (GFP-Gab1) in E6 cells facilitated the

These data provide direct evidence demonstrating that
Gab1 is essential for the activation of mTORC1 and
mTORC2 after EGF stimulation.

mTORCs occurs via Gab1 after EGF stimulation (Figure
2 and 3). We next questioned how Gab1 regulates the
plasma membrane translocation of mTORCs. As shown
in recent studies, many proteins, such as RalB and Rac1,
may associate with mTORCs and regulate the plasma
membrane translocation of mTORCs [16, 27]. To identify a
potential association between Gab1 and mTORCs, we used
co-immunoprecipitation. First, we found that Gab1
associated with mTORCs after EGF stimulation (Figure 5A
and 5B). Interestingly, Gab1 also associated with mTORCs

in the absence EGF stimulation. These data suggest that
Gab1 had previously associated with mTORCs in cells.
Then, we also knocked down Gab1 in T24 cells. We
found that knockdown of Gab1 decreased the integrity of
mTORCs in T24 cells (Figure 5A and 5B). Knockdown
of raptor or rictor decreased the integrity of mTORCs and
also decreased the association of Gab1 with mTORCs
(Figure 3A and 3B). According to these data, Gab1 not only
regulates the plasma membrane translocation of mTORCs
but also stabilizes the integrity of mTORCs. Furthermore,
we overexpressed Gab1 in E6 cells, and we found that Gab1
overexpression increased the amount of mTOR complexes
in cells (Figure 5C). Thus, we demonstrated that Gab1
associated with mTORCs and stabilized their integrity.
Furthermore, these functions were EGF-independent.

report also showed similar findings, in which rapamycin
inhibited mTORC1 and induced phosphorylation of
AKT at Ser473 in urothelial carcinoma [2]. In addition
to mTORC1, Chen et al. (2011) also revealed that ER
stress inhibits mTORC2 through GSK-3-mediated
phosphorylation of rictor at Ser1235 [14].
However, it has been reported that mTORC2
is directly activated by PIP3 in HEK293T cells [11].
Thus far, there is no evidence to indicate that signaling
extends beyond PIP3 in the activation of mTORC2.
Cao et al. (2009) revealed that EGF exerts its effects
via Gab1 by means of an unidentified mechanism to
regulate mTORC2 activity [18]. In fact, Gab1 is a major
protein that associates with PIP3 after EGF stimulation
[19]. In this study, we provide evidence to support the
hypothesis that Gab1 associates with mTORC2 and
regulates mTORC2 membrane translocation. When
PI3K is inhibited, mTORC2 does not translocate to the
plasma membrane after EGF stimulation. Moreover, Gab1
also associates with mTORC1 and regulates mTORC1
membrane translocation. We also revealed that PI3K
activates mTORCs via the PH domain of Gab1, which
binds to PIP3.
Interestingly, Gab1 not only associates with
mTORCs and regulates their plasma membrane
translocation but also stabilizes the integrity of mTORCs.
Only the components of mTORCs (raptor, rictor and sin1)
have been known to regulate the integrity of mTORCs [5].
In fact, there are two endogenous inhibitors of mTORCs,
DEPTOR and XPLN. Depletion of DEPTOR activates
mTORCs, and mTOR negatively regulates the protein and
mRNA expression of DEPTOR [33]. XPLN is a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho GTPases and is
a partner of mTORC2 but not mTORC1. Knockdown of
XPLN enhances the activity of mTORC2 [34]. However,
DEPTOR and XPLN are not similar to raptor, rictor and
sin1. DEPTOR and XPLN interact with mTORCs and
inhibit their activity. In this study, we found that Gab1
associates with mTORCs and regulates their integrity.
Thus, we suggest that Gab1 is an endogenous enhancer
of mTORCs.
Translocation of mTORCs is important for their
activation after growth factor stimulation. In this study,
we presented evidence to suggest that mTORCs might
translocate to the plasma membrane via Gab1-PIP3
binding after EGF stimulation. A recent study indicated
that the WD40 domain in raptor binds the lipid PI(3,5)
P2, suggesting that mTORC1 translocates to the plasma
membrane [35]. However, it has previously been shown
that mTORC1 is activated directly by GTP-bound Rheb
on the surface of lysosomes [36]. PI(3,5)P2 is generated in
lysosomes and at the plasma membrane after stimulation
with amino acids and growth factors, and PI(3,5)P2
binding could also contribute to lysosome translocation.
Another mechanism of mTORC1 membrane translocation
occurs via RalB. Martin et al. (2014) revealed that RalB

DISCUSSION
Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of
malignancy in long-term dialysis patients and kidney
transplant recipients in Taiwan [1]. mTORCs pathway
is important in urothelial carcinoma [28] and it already
known that EGF triggers mTORCs activation [18].
A high percentage of EGFR-positive cases (up to
50% of cases) were observed in high-grade urothelial
carcinoma [26]. These data suggest that EGFR plays
a crucial role in urothelial carcinoma and Gab1 is a
major downstream protein in EGFR signal transduction
pathway. Therefore, Gab1 may play an important role in
regulating EGF-mediated mTORC activity in urothelial
carcinoma. Not only urothelial carcinoma, it has been
reported that mTORCs are activated in many different
carcinomas, such as renal cell carcinoma, melanoma
and prostate tumors [29, 30]. mTORC1 promotes
HIF-1α and VEGF protein and mRNA expression
to induce angiogenesis in renal cell carcinoma [31].
Through the activation of AKT and SGK, mTORC2
may directly drive tumorigenesis. AKT promotes
proliferation, survival and nutrient uptake in tumor cells
[32]. Furthermore, rictor promotes the assembly and
activity of mTORC2, which is required for the growth
of various tumor cell lines and for the growth of prostate
tumors in PTEN-deficient mice [30]. In this study, we
indicate the importance of regulation of mTORCs via
Gab1 after EGF stimulation.
Several studies have indicated that growth factor
stimulation is involved in the regulation of mTORC2.
Currently, it is thought that mTORC2 is activated via
the PI3K pathway. Zinzalla et al. (2011) revealed that
in the PI3K pathway, the association with ribosomes
generates signals that are transduced to the mTORC2
signaling pathway [12]. In fact, mTORC2 is also regulated
by mTORC1. Julien et al. (2009) and Liu et al. (2013)
revealed that mTORC1-activated p70S6K phosphorylated
rictor at Thr1135 and phosphorylated sin1 at Thr86 and
Thr398 to inhibit mTORC2 activity [13, 15]. Our previous

regulates serum-induced mTORC1 plasma membrane
translocation and the activity of mTOR1 in HEK293T
cells [27]. Regarding mTORC2, it has been reported that
both mTORC2 and AKT were isolated from lipid rafts,
which traditionally associate with the plasma membrane
[37]. Furthermore, mTORC1 and mTORC2 colocalized
with Rac1 at the plasma membrane after serum treatment,
and deletion of Rac1 prevented membrane localization
of mTORCs [16]. However, knowledge regarding the
membrane translocation of mTORCs is minimal.
Based on in vivo and in vitro studies, we
have identified increased expression of Gab1 and
phosphorylation of mTORCs in rats with urothelial
carcinoma and human urothelial carcinoma tumor tissues.
Taken together, our results highlight the unique role of
Gab1 in the regulation of mTORCs after EGF stimulation
(Figure 6) as well as the crucial role of Gab1 in urothelial
carcinoma. We believe that Gab1 may be a biomarker
to predict the diagnosis and drugs response of urothelial
carcinoma.

CA) using the INTERFERin siRNA reagent according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Polyplus-transfection,
New York, NY).

(Control group, 10 rats and BBN group, 10 tars) were
sacrificed under pentobarbital anesthesia after 20 weeks of
treatment. The protocol was approved by the Animal Care
and Research Committee of Taichung Veterans General
Hospital (permit number: La-96409).

Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
For western blotting, the cells and patient
samples were lysed in RIPA buffer (Millipore, Billerica,
Massachusetts) with HaltTM protease & phosphatase
inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). For
immunoprecipitation, the primary antibodies (Gab1, 1:50
and rictor, 1:50) were incubated with Dynabeads® Protein
G (Invitrogen Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway) for 1 h at 25°C,
followed by incubation with the cell lysates (500 μg-4 mg)
for 2 h at 25°C. Total cell extracts and immunoprecipitated
proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed
by immunoblotting. The blots were visualized with
SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and detected using
X-ray film (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo). The quantitation of
the western blot was quantified by Multi Gauge V3.0. The
experiments were repeated in triplicate.

Human tumor specimens
All urothelial carcinoma samples and normal
bladder tissue from patients were obtained from the
Department of Urology at the Taichung Veterans General
Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, with the approval of the
Institutional Review Board (IRB number: CG11044).

Statistics
All data are expressed as the mean ± standard
deviation. All statistical analyses were performed using
the Statistical Program of Social Sciences software
(SPSS version 13.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL). Student’s t-test was used to determine whether
there was a significant difference between two means.
Statistical significance was defined as a P value less
than 0.05.

Morphometric analysis and
immunofluorescence stain

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

After fixing bladder tissue in 10% formalin, the
lumen was inspected for grossly visible lesions. All
immunohistochemical studies were performed on paraffinembedded sections. The 4-μm-thick deparaffinized
sections were incubated with the primary antibodies Gab1
(1:250), AKT-pS473 (1:250) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and mTOR-pS2481 (1:250)
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA). As a negative control, the
primary antibody was replaced with normal rabbit IgG,
and staining was not performed. All slides were scanned
with a Leica DM750. For the immunofluorescence
staining, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 30 min and incubated in 1% Triton-100 for 30 min at
25°C. The primary antibodies Gab1 (1:100) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), rictor (1:1000)
and mTOR (1:500) (GeneTex, Hsinchu, Taiwan) were
incubated overnight at 4°C. The secondary antibodies
Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit; Alexa
Fluor® 546 goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit; and Alexa
Fluor® 647 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY)
were incubated for 1 h at 25°C, and the coverslips were
mounted in DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech,
Birmingham, Alabama) and scanned by laser-scanning
confocal microscopy (OLYMPUS FLUOVIEW FV1000).
The experiments were repeated in triplicate.
