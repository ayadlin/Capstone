Abstract
Glioblastomas multiforme (GBM) contain highly tumorigenic, self-renewing populations of stem/initiating
cells [glioblastoma stem cells (GSC)] that contribute to tumor propagation and treatment resistance. However,
our knowledge of the speciﬁc signaling pathways that regulate GSCs is limited. The MET tyrosine kinase is known
to stimulate the survival, proliferation, and invasion of various cancers including GBM. Here, we identiﬁed a
distinct fraction of cells expressing a high level of MET in human primary GBM specimens that were preferentially
localized in perivascular regions of human GBM biopsy tissues and were found to be highly clonogenic,
tumorigenic, and resistant to radiation. Inhibition of MET signaling in GSCs disrupted tumor growth and
invasiveness both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that MET activation is required for GSCs. Together, our ﬁndings
indicate that MET activation in GBM is a functional requisite for the cancer stem cell phenotype and a promising
therapeutic target. Cancer Res; 72(15); 3828–38. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and
lethal primary brain tumor with a median survival of 14.6
months despite maximal therapy (1). As included in classiﬁcation criteria for GBMs, excessive and unstable blood vessel
formation and tumor necrosis associated with hypoxia are key
pathologic characteristics of GBMs (2). GBMs heavily inﬁltrate
into the neighboring brain parenchyma and are almost uniformly resistant to standard therapeutic regimes such as
irradiation and chemotherapy (3). These biologic characteristics of GBMs are major reasons of lethality and need to be
targeted for therapy.
Cancer stem cell hypothesis posits that a subpopulation
of cancer cells is highly enriched with tumorigenic potential
(3–7). Compared with bulk tumor cells, glioblastoma stem cells

(GSC) survive better against irradiation and chemotherapies,
thereby contributing to therapeutic resistance and tumor
recurrence (8, 9). In addition, GSCs frequently reside in perivascular and hypoxic regions, actively promoting angiogenesis
and facilitating the survival in harsh environment (10–12).
However, the underlying molecular pathways that govern these
processes in GSCs are poorly understood.
The MET receptor tyrosine kinase regulates cell growth
and motility. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor
is a cognate ligand for MET signaling (13, 14). MET pathway
activation induces glioma cell proliferation, survival, and
migration (15, 16). We and others reported that MET overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and tumor
invasiveness in GBM patients (17, 18). Large-scale genomic
studies conﬁrmed frequent MET pathway activation and
genomic ampliﬁcation of MET in GBMs, indicating that
aberrant activation of MET is an important genetic event
in GBMs (19–21).
As hypoxia directly induces MET expression and HGF
induces expression of VEGF in glioma cells, MET signaling
may be particularly important for tumor cell survival in
hypoxia and co-option with angiogenesis (15, 22, 23). In
addition, it was reported that MET signaling is a key mechanism to maintain stem cell niche in brain (24). A recent study
reported that MET signaling enhances GSC populations, suggesting a link between MET signaling and GSCs (25). The
precise roles of MET signaling operated in GSCs, however,
remain unclear (25).
On the basis of this background, we hypothesized that MET
signaling promotes self-renewal and therapeutic resistance of
GSCs. By extensive in vivo and in vitro studies using a large
number of freshly isolated patient-derived GBM cells, we
provide evidence suggesting that MET signaling plays critical
roles in GSC maintenance, migration, and resistance to
radiation.

MET Signaling in Glioblastoma Stem Cells

Materials and Methods
Isolation of primary GBM cells and establishment of
short-term cultured GSCs
Following informed consent, glioblastoma specimens were
obtained from patients undergoing surgery at the Samsung
Medical Center in accordance with the Institutional Review
Boards. Tumor specimens were classiﬁed as GBM based on
World Health Organization criteria by examination of pathologists (2). Tumor specimens were enzymatically dissociated
into single cells and cultured, following the procedures previously reported (26, 27).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and sorting
Patient GBM-derived tumor cells were dissociated into single
cells and labeled with the following antibodies; anti-MET (R&D
Systems), anti-CD133–PE (Miltenyi Biotec), and anti-CD15–
FITC (MMA clone, BD Biosciences; ref. 28). For MET staining
and sorting, one million cells were labeled with 2 mg of antibodies
at 4 C for 10 minutes. Antibodies against mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to PE or ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were
used as antibody isotype controls (BD Biosciences). The stained
cells were analyzed on the FACS Aria (BD Biosciences). CellQuest Acquisition and Analysis software (BD Biosciences) was
used to acquire and quantify the ﬂuorescence signal distributions and intensities from individual cells.
Antibodies
The following antibodies were used as primary antibodies:
MET (Zymed and Santa Cruz for detection of total MET
protein; Cell Signaling for detection of phosphorylated MET
proteins), Nestin, Sox2 (R&D Systems), GFAP (Dako), TuJ1
(Covance), O4 (Chemicon), a-tubulin and b-actin (Sigma), and
AKT and Erk (Cell Signaling).
Tumorsphere forming limiting dilution assay
Tumor cells were dissociated into single-cell suspensions,
sorted for MET expression, and then plated into 96-well plates
with various seeding densities (1–500 cells per well depending
on the experiment, more than 30 wells for each condition).
Intracranial tumor cell injection into NOD/SCID Il2rg/
mice
Unsorted GBM cells or the sorted METhigh and METlow/
tumor cells were resuspended in 5 mL of HBSS and injected
stereotactically into the striatum of adult nonobese diabetic/
severe combined immunodeﬁciency mice lacking interleukin2 gamma receptor (NOD/SCID Il2rg/) mice by using a
stereotactic device (Kopf instruments; coordinates: 2 mm
anterior, 2 mm lateral, and 2.5 mm depth from the dura). Mice
with neurologic signs were killed for the analysis of tumor
histology and immunohistochemistry. All mice experiments
were carried out according to the guidelines of the Animal Use
and Care Committees.
In vivo delivery of MET siRNA-polyelectrolyte–micelle
complexes
For the conjugation of MET siRNA or nontargeting siRNA
with polyethylene glycol 5000 (PEG5K), we followed the

www.aacrjournals.org

procedures as previously described (29). PEG-MET siRNA
or PEG-control siRNA (0.5 mg/kg body weight) complexes
were delivered through tail vein injections twice a week for
4 weeks.
Determination of intracranial tumor volumes
To estimate the size of intracranial tumor, we carried
immunohistochemical analysis using an anti-human nuclei
speciﬁc antibody (Chemicon) on the serial brain sections.
Staining images were analyzed by ImageJ software (NIH), and
the number of immunopositive cells and the total number of
cells in a given ﬁeld were calculated. The volume of the
intracranial tumor was estimated by the largest width2 
length  0.5.
Statistical analysis
All values are shown as mean  SD. For group comparison,
paired t test (2 group comparison) or ANOVA (more than 3
group comparison) were used. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
was done using Prism 4.0 software.

Results
MET-positive tumor cells are preferentially located in
perivascular regions of human GBM specimens and
coexpress GSC markers
We reasoned that components of a GSC regulator pathway
would be preferentially expressed in perivascular regions and
hypoxic edges, the proposed in vivo niches for GSCs (10). By
immunohistochemical analysis using human GBM patient
specimens (n ¼ 93), we determined the expression patterns
and intensities of various growth factor receptors, oncogenes,
and stem cell–associated proteins.
High frequency of cells positive for MET (more than 10%
of tumor cells) in GBM specimens was positively correlated
with the shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) of the patients, suggesting a potential role of
MET overexpression in malignancy (Fig. 1A and B). We also
determined whether high expression of MET mRNA in GBM
specimens portends poor patient survival by the analysis of
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 19). Patients with high MET mRNA expression have shorter PFS and OS, however, the prognostic
value was marginal although signiﬁcant (Supplementary
Fig. S1).
We found that MET protein expression displayed inter- and
intratumoral heterogeneity. Interestingly, cells strongly
stained for MET were predominantly located near blood
vessels and hypoxic edges (Fig. 1C and D). To quantify the
proximity between MET-positive cells and endothelial cells in
primary GBM specimens, we carried out dual immunoﬂuorescence for CD31 (endothelial marker) and MET using the
frozen sections derived from 4 GBM patient specimens (Fig.
1E–G). MET-positive cells were located closely to the nearest
blood vessels, compared with MET-negative cells (Fig. 1G). In
addition, a subset of tumor cells express both GSC enrichment
markers CD133/CD15 and MET (Supplementary Fig. S2;
refs. 7, 28).

MET Signaling in Glioblastoma Stem Cells

To obtain more quantitative results, we determined the
expression level of MET in the freshly dissociated cells
obtained from 23 different GBM patients by ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Fig. 2A). The percentages of MET-positive cells vary between the samples (3.7%–
76.4% of bulk cells; SD 16.1%). In 15 of 23 samples, the
percentages of MET-positive cells are between 10% to 30% of
the bulk cells. The cells dissociated from nontumor epileptic
brain specimens did not have any distinct MET-positive population (data not shown). To determine whether there are
distinct subpopulations expressing both MET and CD133 and/
or CD15, we carried out dual FACS staining on the freshly
isolated GBM cells derived from 14 different patients (Fig. 2A
and Supplementary Table S1). CD133- and/or CD15-positive
cells were enriched (2- to 7- fold) in MET-positive subpopulation compared with the bulk tumor cells. Conversely, METpositive cells were enriched in CD133þ or CD15þ populations
(Supplementary Table S1).
To corroborate these ﬁndings, we extended our analysis to
the previously characterized GSCs derived from human GBM

specimens (26, 28). GSCs and their derivatives used in this
study are described in supplementary information (Supplementary Table S2). We fractionated these short-term cultured
GSCs by FACS and carried out immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2B).
MET protein was highly expressed in CD133þ (or in CD15þ)
subpopulations compared with the corresponding negative
populations in all 3 GSCs (Fig. 2B). Total MET and activated
MET protein (Y1234) were preferentially expressed in GSCenriched population compared with GSC-depleted cells (Fig.
2C). Collectively, these data indicated that MET-positive GBM
cells have activated MET signaling and that they signiﬁcantly
overlap with CD133þ and/or CD15þ GBM populations.
METhigh cells sustain in vitro growth and are highly
clonogenic compared with METlow/ cells
To determine whether METhigh GBM cells have cellular
characteristics associated with GSC phenotypes, we used FACS
using an antibody recognizing the extracellular domain of MET
protein and prospectively isolated METhigh and METlow/
subpopulations from the patient GBM specimen 448. We
operationally deﬁned METhigh cells as the cells with top 10%
to 20% highest intensities out of total MET-positive cells. After
conﬁrming the purity and viability of these sorted populations
by FACS reexamination, we ﬁrst determined the growth kinetics of each subpopulation by culturing these cells in the
standard stem cell culture condition. METhigh cells readily
formed neurosphere-like aggregates and continued to proliferate, whereas METlow/ cells failed to sustain active cell
growth in vitro (Fig. 3A–C).
Clonogenic growth as neurospheres is an in vitro indicator of
self-renewal in normal neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC) and
GSCs. To determine the clonogenic potentials of METhigh and
METlow/ populations, we carried out limiting dilution assays
(LDA) using both 448 freshly isolated GBM cells and 206 shortterm cultured GSCs (Fig. 3D). FACS-sorted METhigh and
METlow/ cells were plated into 96-well plates with various
seeding densities and allowed to grow. Neurospheres were
readily formed by METhigh cells but not by METlow/ cells (Fig.
3D). In addition, we carried out a competitive growth assays in
which METhigh and METlow/ cells were differentially labeled
with GFP and red ﬂuorescence protein (RFP), respectively,
mixed at various ratios, and then cultured for additional 2
weeks. Even when the initial fraction of METhigh GFP cells was
10%, more than 85% of the resultant cells after the culture were
GFP positive (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data indicated
that METhigh GBM cells are highly clonogenic and sustain in
vitro growth of total population.
To determine whether the HGF/MET signaling pathway is
functional in GSCs, we examined the activation status of MET
downstream effectors (Supplementary Fig. S3A). GSCs displayed basal activation of MET, suggesting the presence of an
autocrine loop with further response to the addition of exogenous HGF. Treatment with exogenous HGF further increased
activated MET (Y1234 and Y1349), AKT (S473), and ERK (16).
Consistent with this, we detected high levels of the secreted
HGF protein in GSC-conditioned media (7 of 11 GSCs) by
ELISA assays (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Finally, we determined
whether HGF could induce the proliferation of GBM cells by

carrying out LDA. Similar to EGF, HGF increased the clonogenic growth of GBM cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Collectively, these data indicated the presence of active HGF/MET
signaling in GSCs.
METhigh GBM cells are highly tumorigenic in orthotopic
transplantation models
Tumorigenicity in vivo is the gold standard for determining
cancer stemness. We injected METhigh and METlow/- cells into

3832

Cancer Res; 72(15) August 1, 2012

the brains of highly immunodeﬁcient NOD/SCID Il2rg/ mice
and monitored tumor formation (30). METhigh cells from 4
GBMs (448 and 464, freshly isolated patient GBM cells; 822 and
206, short-term cultured GSCs) generated tumors more efﬁciently than their corresponding METlow/ cells (Fig. 4A and B).
Of note, all of the above GBM cells express HGF (data not
shown). To estimate the relative enrichment of tumorigenicity
in METhigh cells compared with METlow/ cells, we carried out
in vivo tumorigenicity titration assays (Fig. 4C). Varying numbers of METhigh and METlow/ cells isolated from primary GBM
specimen (559 and 905) were injected into brains of NOD/SCID
Il2rg/ mice. Two of 5 mice injected with 100 METhigh cells
developed tumors and so did all the mice (n ¼ 5) that had 1,000
METhigh cells (median survival of 88 days). In contrast, all the
mice that received 100 METlow/ cells and 4 of 5 mice injected
with 1,000 METlow/ cells showed no sign of tumor development 6 months after the injection (Fig. 4C). Kaplan–Meier
survival analysis further showed signiﬁcant survival differences between animals receiving these subpopulations (Fig.
4D and E).
Similar to the parental GBM tumor, 448 METhigh cell–
derived xenograft tumors harbored a mixture of METhigh cells
and METlow/ cells, indicating the reconstitution of tumor
heterogeneity (ref. 31; Supplementary Fig. S4). In addition,
immunohistochemical analysis on the xenograft tumors
revealed that METhigh cells were preferentially located near
the blood vessels and inﬁltrating edges of tumors (Fig. 4F–H).
Robust expression of tumor-derived HGF was also detected in
xenograft sections by immunohistochemical analysis, suggesting an active HGF/MET signaling in these tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5).
METhigh cells are efﬁcient in tumor formation regardless
of CD133 expression
Our data showed that some of METhigh cells coexpress
CD133 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S1). To determine
whether MET expression alone can enrich GSCs, we fractionated GBM cells into 4 subpopulations (CD133þ/METhigh,
CD133/METhigh, CD133þ/METlow/, and CD133/METlow/
cells) and determined their tumor formation efﬁciencies. Both
CD133þ/METhigh and CD133/METhigh cells, derived from the
freshly isolated GBM cells (060) and GBM xenografts (559 and
464), were highly efﬁcient in tumor formation, whereas
CD133þ/METlow/ and CD133/METlow/ cells were not
(Fig. 5A). In vitro clonogenic potential of each subpopulation
correlated with in vivo tumorigenicity of the corresponding
cells (Fig. 5B). These data suggested that MET, but not CD133,
is a major determinant for GSC enrichment at least in these
GBMs.
MET inhibition decreases the survival, migration, and
clonogenicity of GSCs
To interrogate the role of MET in GSC biology, we inhibited
MET by short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated knockdown and
evaluated its effects on GSCs. To ensure the speciﬁc knockdown of MET, we used 2 independent sequences of shRNA
directed against MET mRNA. Both MET shRNA constructs led
to a signiﬁcant reduction in MET protein compared with the

decreased cell proliferation. MET knockdown signiﬁcantly
decreased the clonogenicity of various GSCs, determined by
LDA (Supplementary Fig. S6D and E). We also tested whether
pharmacologic inhibition of MET signaling can decrease GSC
clonogenicity. GSCs treated with SU11274, a widely used MET
kinase inhibitor (25, 32), were less efﬁcient in tumor-sphere
formation compared with the control (Fig. 6A).

5 months. B, limiting dilution sphere forming assays to determine the
clonogenic potentials of each subpopulations from 060 and 090, the

plates with various seeding densities (1–500 cells per well, 24 wells
per each condition).

HGF is an effective chemokine for glioma cell migration
(13, 33). To test whether MET signaling mediates invasive
growth of GSCs, we carried out transwell-based in vitro
migration assays (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B). We plated
control shRNA- or MET shRNA–transduced GBM cells in
serum-free media and added serum (or HGF)-containing
media on the other side of the transwell membranes to
stimulate migration. MET knockdown decreased the number
of migrating/invading cells up to 70% compared with the
control (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B). In addition, we
carried out ex vivo brain slice assays that simulate in vivo

migration behavior much better than transwell assays
(Supplementary Fig. S7C). RFP-expressing GSCs were treated with a chemical MET inhibitor PHA665752 for one day,
mixed with GFP-expressing GSCs treated with the vehicle
control, and then implanted into the cortex region of 300-mm
thick brain slices. Three days after, more than 90% of the
migrated cells were GFP positive, suggesting that MET
inhibition decreases glioma cell invasion (Supplementary
Fig. S7C and D). Together, these data showed that MET
signaling is required for the self-renewal, proliferation, and
migration of GSCs.
In vivo MET targeting via liposome-conjugated siRNA
increases the survival of tumor bearing mice
By using GSC-derived tumors as a clinically relevant model
system, we wanted to test whether MET targeting in vivo could
provide therapeutic beneﬁt. Polyelectrolyte complex micelles
are stable in vivo and efﬁcient for intracranial delivery of siRNA
because of the highly lipophilic nature of brain tissues (29). We
conjugated MET siRNA or nontargeting siRNA with polyethylene glycol 5000 (PEG5K) and mixed with small liposomes
(29). Intracranial tumors were generated from 3 freshly isolated
GBM cells (559 and 578, 5 for each group; 464, 4 for each group).
These cells express both MET and HGF at high levels, determined by Western blot analysis and HGF ELISA (data not
shown). Once tumors were established in the mouse brains, we
initiated the administration of either PEG-MET siRNA or PEGcontrol siRNA (0.5 mg/kg body weight) intravenously twice a
week for 4 weeks. Compared with the tumors from the control
siRNA-treated mice, tumor cells in MET siRNA-treated mice
revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in MET staining positivity (Fig.
6B). After 4 weeks of treatment, we monitored the size of
tumors by MRI (Fig. 6C) and brain histology section (Fig. 6D
and Supplementary Fig. S8). All of MET siRNA–treated groups
showed a signiﬁcant decrease in tumor volumes, indicating the
efﬁcacy of in vivo MET targeting in intracranial GSC-derived
tumors (Fig. 6E).
Irradiation induces MET upregulation and MET
targeting decreases the clonogenicity of surviving GBM
cells
Irradiation treatment decreases tumor burden and prolong the survival of GBM patients. However, patients eventually succumb because of tumor recurrence. Given the
observations that GSCs preferentially survive radiation and
that MET targeting disrupted GSC self-renewal and clonogenicity, we hypothesized that combination of radiation and
MET inhibition in GSCs might be an effective therapeutic
approach (9, 34, 35). Cells of a short-term cultured GSC (822)
were irradiated in vitro with doses of 5 or 10 Gy and
harvested 2 days later. We found about a 3-fold increase in
the number of MET-positive cells and upregulation of MET
protein in irradiated cells compared with nonradiated control (Fig. 7A and B). To determine the clonogenic potentials
of METhigh and METlow/ GBM cells after radiation treatment, we sorted METhigh and METlow/- cells from the freshly
isolated 448 GBM cells, exposed them to radiation, and
immediately seeded at the clonal density for LDA assays.

METhigh cells remained highly clonogenic after radiation
treatment, whereas irradiated METlow/ cells were signiﬁcantly impaired in the ability to generate subsequent colonies (Fig. 7C). To determine whether MET is directly
involved in the clonal regrowth after radiation, we carried
out the similar clonogenic assays by MET knockdown or
treatment with SU11274. Cells with MET inhibition were
hardly able to generate spheres after radiation treatment,
suggesting that MET inhibition signiﬁcantly sensitizes GBM
cells to radiation (Fig. 7D and Supplementary Fig. S9).
The above data raise the possibility that MET upregulation
after radiation can be a prognostic biomarker for the GBM
patients who have received radiation therapy. We acquired 14
matched sets of pre- and postirradiated (recurrent) tumor
specimens from the same GBM patients (Supplementary Table
S3). All the patients were diagnosed as de novo primary GBMs
and received radiation as a front-line therapy after initial

protein by immunohistochemical analysis on the sections from
pre- and postradiated GBM specimens. In 4 sets, MET expression in postradiated GBM specimens was signiﬁcantly
increased (>2-fold increase in the number of MET-positive
cells) compared with the untreated specimens. The remaining
10 sets showed either unchanged or modest changes in MET
expression. Notably, the patients showing the signiﬁcant MET
induction had worse prognosis (median survival of 55 days after
recurrence) than the other group (median survival of 189 days; P
< 0.01; Fig. 7E), suggesting that MET upregulation after radiation is associated with aggressive growth of recurrent tumors.

GSCs remains controversial because of unresolved questions with regard to the frequency of these cells, the surface

cell(s) of origin (31, 36). Previous reports have identiﬁed a series
of GSC enrichment markers, including CD133, CD15, CD44,
and A2B5 (7, 28, 37, 38). Although useful for the prospective
isolation of putative GSCs, it is unclear whether these markers
have distinct functions pertinent to GSC phenotypes (39, 40).
Therefore, our screening approach in search for a GSC regulator was focused on the protein expression pattern in patient-

are highly enriched in perivascular regions of human GBMs in

In this study, we identiﬁed a distinct fraction of cells
expressing high level of MET in various human primary GBMs
and showed that these subpopulations have key characteristics
of GSCs. Through extensive in vivo limiting dilution tumor
formation assays, we have shown that METhigh GBM cells are

highly enriched with tumor stem/propagating populations,
supporting that MET is a key regulator of GSCs. We showed
the importance of MET in GSC biology by showing that MET
inhibition disrupts the clonogenicity, radioresistance, and
tumorigenicity of GSCs. Co-option with angiogenesis and
tumor cell survival in hypoxia are critical for tumor growth,
and MET signaling is known to play important roles on these
processes. Therefore, high MET expression in GSCs can be
viewed as an adaptive response of cancer cells to their microenvironment (42, 43).
Numerous small molecule inhibitors and antagonistic antibodies targeting the HGF/MET pathway are at advanced stages
of clinical development (44–48). Understanding of the molecular determinant(s) of response and resistance to HGF/MET
targeting therapeutic agents is one of the most critical unmet
needs in clinical research. A few of biomarkers to predict
therapeutic response have been proposed, including genomic
ampliﬁcation of MET, HGF levels, or MET expression (total and
phosphorylated MET), and PTEN status (33, 49, 50). Robustness of these biomarkers in GBM needs further validation. For
example, genomic MET ampliﬁcation seems to predict sensitivity to MET inhibition in gastric cancers but less likely in
GBMs (33). A recent paper reported that HGF autocrine status
may correlate with MET activity in GBM and predict sensitivity
to MET inhibitors (33). We have determined the correlation
between tumor-derived HGF and sensitivity to MET inhibition.
Our ongoing studies so far indicated that high HGF-producing
GBM cells seem to be more sensitive to MET inhibition
compared with the little or no HGF-expressing GBM cells,
consistent with the previous report (data not shown; ref. 33).
Further studies are warranted to determine the role of HGF in
GSC biology, the effects of HGF targeting on GSC self-renewal
and tumorigenicity, and the correlation between HGF and GSC
sensitivity to MET inhibition in vivo.

In conclusion, we show that MET is an enrichment marker
for GSCs and a functional requisite for cancer stem phenotype. Not only will these data provide a clue for a more
thorough understanding of cancer stem cell biology but also
they further implicate MET as a promising therapeutic
target.
