Maintenance of Androgen Receptor Inactivation by
S-Nitrosylation
Yu Qin, Anindya Dey, Hamsa Thayele Purayil, and Yehia Daaka

Abstract
Antiandrogens target ligand-binding domain of androgen receptor (AR) and are used as ﬁrst-line therapeutics
to treat patients diagnosed with locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. Although initially beneﬁcial as
judged with actual tumor mass shrinkage, this therapy invariably fails and the cancer reappears as castrationresistant disease. Here, we report that increased intracellular nitric oxide (NO) levels lead to growth inhibition of
both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate tumors through a mechanism that involves AR
function inactivation by S-nitrosylation of a single C601 residue present in the DNA-binding domain. AR
S-nitrosylation does not impact its subcellular distribution but attenuates its ability to bind AR-responsive
elements in promoter region of target genes. Mechanistically, AR is transnitrosylated by its partner HSP90 protein.
Ubiquitous small-molecule NO donors promote the AR S-nitrosylation and inhibit growth of castration-resistant
prostate tumors. These ﬁndings reveal a new mechanism of regulating AR function and suggest that sequential
targeting of distinct domains of AR may extend therapeutic efﬁcacy for patients with advanced prostate cancer.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed malignancy in males
and the second leading cause of male cancer–related mortality
in majority of Western countries (1). Patients with cancer
conﬁned to the prostate gland have several treatment options,
including watchful waiting, surgery, and radiation. Pathologic
growth of the prostate is controlled mainly by steroid androgens and locally advanced and metastatic diseases are treated
with endocrine therapies aimed to decrease circulating androgen levels via castration, or block androgen receptor (AR)
activation with ligand antagonist antiandrogens (2). A limitation of the hormonal therapies is that they offer only a
temporary relief in that the disease progresses to castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC) characterized by aggressive
growth and invasion of distal organs, predominantly the bone
(3–5) and to date, there is no cure for CRPC.
Factors involved in the transition of prostate cancer from
androgen-dependent to CRPC are not well established and
present an obstacle to improving disease outcome. Emerging
evidence implicates AR not only in the initiation but also
progression of the disease to CRPC. Available work has iden-

tiﬁed activating mutations in AR, and model transgenic mice
harboring mutated AR develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia that progress to invasive cancer (6). CRPC lesions exhibit
frequent mutations in AR, which allow it to be activated by
steroids other than androgens, or even antiandrogens. Also, AR
can be transactivated by factors other than androgens, including peptide growth factors (7) that exert their effects on target
cells by activating cognate plasma membrane-anchored receptors. These laboratory and clinical results ﬁrmly implicate AR
in prostate carcinogenesis.
AR is an androgen-dependent transcription factor (8) that
manifests its effects on target cells by controlling expression of
speciﬁc genes through association with protein coregulators in
the form of coactivators and corepressors (9, 10). In general,
multi-protein complex formation is controlled by posttranslational changes of partner proteins, and AR has been reported
to undergo several posttranslational modiﬁcations, including
phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and acetylation that impact
its subcellular localization, stability, and overall transcriptional
activity (11–13). Here, we tested the idea that AR undergoes the
S-nitrosylation modiﬁcation, that is, covalent attachment of a
nitric oxide (NO) group to a cysteine thiol, and determined the
effect on AR signal transduction and consequent growth of
prostate tumors.

Materials and Methods

LNCaP, PC3, 22Rv1, and HEK293 cells were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection. LNCaP C4-2 cells were
obtained from MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX).
LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% HEPES, 1% D-glucose, and 1% sodium

S-Nitrosylation Attenuates AR DBD Function

supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 mg/mL insulin, 13.65 pg/mL
triiodothyronine, 5 mg/mL apo-transferrin, 0.244 mg/mL a-biotin, and 25 mg/mL adenine (all from Sigma). PC3 and HEK293
cells were maintained in Ham's F12 and Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium (DMEM), respectively, supplemented with 10%
FBS. Androgen deprivation was accomplished by incubation in
phenol red–free culture medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped serum. Stable overexpression of endothelial nitric
oxide synthase (eNOS) in LNCaP cells was achieved by transfecting cells with pcDNA3-HA-eNOS. Transfected cells were
propagated in the presence of G418 (1 mg/mL) for selection
for 4 weeks. Positive clones were pooled and maintained with
G418 (100 mg/mL). Transient forced overexpression of AR in PC3
cells was done by transfecting cells with pcDNA3-Flag-AR. Stable
knockdown of eNOS was achieved by infection of short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) constructs (Open Biosystems) in lentiviral pLKO
vector plus equal concentration of vesicular stomatitis virus G
and D8.9 vector into packaging HEK293T cells. Lentivirus-containing medium was harvested, mixed with polybrene, and used
to infect LNCaP cells. The infected polyclonal cells were selected
with 2 mg/mL puromycin for 2 weeks and maintained in medium
containing 1 mg/mL puromycin. Cell growth and doubling time
analyses were done with WST-1 reagent.
Real-time PCR
Cells were cultured in starvation medium for 24 hours
followed by stimulation with R1881 (1 nmol/L) in the presence,
or absence, of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) for 48 hours. Total
RNA was isolated using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit
(Roche) and mRNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using
the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad). Prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA; in LNCaP) and FKBP51 (in PC3)
gene levels were measured by iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) and iQ5 thermal iCycler detection system. Glyceraldehyde–3–phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an
internal control. The primer sequences were as follows: PSA
(sense) 50 -AGA ATC ACC CGA GCA GGT GC-30 ; PSA (antisense) 50 -CAG AGG AGT TCT TGA CCC CA-30 ; FKBP51 (sense):
50 -CCA AAG CTG TTG AAT GCT GTG A-30 ; FKBP51 (antisense): 50 -CAA ACT CGT TCA TGA GC A GCT G-30 ; GAPDH
(sense) 50 -CAT GGG TGT GAA CCA TGA GAA-30 ; GAPDH
(antisense) 50 -GGT CAT GAG TCC TTC CACGAT-30 .
Western blotting
Appropriately treated cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE.
Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and
immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibody (used at a
1:1,000 dilution except anti-b-actin antibody that was used at a
1:5,000 dilution) at 4 C overnight. Horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated anti-mouse (1:30,000 dilution) or anti-rabbit
(1:20,000 dilution) secondary antibodies were used and proteins were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Biotin switch assay
Protein S-nitrosylation reactions were performed exactly
as described before (14, 15). For protein transnitrosylation,

www.aacrjournals.org

puriﬁed recombinant HSP90b and AR were dialyzed into
Hepes-EDTA-neocuproine buffer. Equimolar amounts of each
protein were exposed, or not, to CysNO (100 mmol/L) for 30
minutes at 37 C in the dark. The resultant S-nitrosylated
proteins were desalted and then used as NO donors to their
un-nitrosylated puriﬁed protein counterpart. Resultant samples were subjected to the NO-biotin switch assay to monitor
transnitrosylation of each protein.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Cells were subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) analysis using the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Kit
(Millipore), according to the manufacturer's instructions. AntiAR (clone N20) or equal amount of isotype control antibody
was added to puriﬁed DNA and incubated overnight at 4 C
with rotation. Protein G agarose beads were added to pellet
protein–DNA complexes followed by sequential washing once
with ice-cold low salt, once with high salt, once with LiCl, and
twice with Tris-EDTA buffers. DNA–protein cross-link was
reversed and chromatin DNA was puriﬁed and measured by
PCR. Primers were as followed: PSA promoter (sense) 50 -TCT
GCC TTT GTC CCC TAG AT-30 ; PSA promoter (antisense) 50 AAC CTT CAT TCC CCA GG ACT-30 ; FKBP51 promoter (sense)
50 -GAG CCT CTT TCT CAG TTT TG-30 ; FKBP51 promoter
(antisense) 50 -CAA TCG GAG TGT AAC CAC ATC-30 . DNA
products were used for quantitative PCR analyses by iQ SYBR
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and iQ5 thermal iCycler detection
system or separated on agarose gel, stained with ethidium
bromide, and visualized under UV light.
Electromobility shift assay
Sequence of the FKBP51 consensus binding site oligonucleotides was 50 -ACA TTC AGA ACA GGG TGT TCT GTG CTC30 . Double-stranded oligonucleotides (100 ng) were endlabeled with [g-32P]-ATP (speciﬁc activity, 3,000 Ci/mmol)
using polynucleotide kinase. For the electromobility shift assay
(EMSA) reaction, 1 ng of labeled probe was mixed with 5 mg of
nuclear extracts in 20 mL EMSA buffer containing 20 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mmol/L KCl, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L
EDTA, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 1 mg poly(dI-dC), and 8% (v/v)
glycerol. Anti-AR-N20 (0.5 mg) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for detecting AR–ARE complex supershift.
Animal studies
Severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories. The Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee preapproved all animal procedures.
LNCaP cells (106 in 50 mL phenol red–free RPMI-1640) were
mixed with equal volume of Matrigel and the mixture was
inoculated subcutaneously into the right ﬂank region of mice.
Tumor dimensions were determined with caliper and tumor
volume (v) was estimated using the equation v ¼ p/6  L  S2,
where L is the long and S the short lengths of the tumor mass.
Tumor growth rate was measured weekly. When tumor size
reached 100 to 200 mm3, animals were randomly divided into
three treatment groups: (i), Control; (ii), luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH); and (iii), GSNO. Control mice were
injected with vehicle PBS. Animals were treated daily with

with GSNO (10 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally for 7 days.

dissected and analyzed for PSA levels by Western blotting.
Experiments were repeated three times and each datapoint

Results
Elevated NO expression attenuates prostate tumor
growth
Deregulated NO levels have been implicated in human
disease, most notably those of the cardiovascular and immune
systems. Less, however, is appreciated about potential role of
ubiquitous NO in tumorigenesis (16). NO has been reported to
exert pro- and antigrowth effects in a manner that is dependent
upon cellular localization and expression level of NOSs and
exposure duration to NO (17). NOSs expression is increased in
prostate cancer (18), and increased expression of eNOS in
prostate cancer tissues highly correlates with decreased
patient survival (19). Impact of elevated expression of NOSs
or NO in CRPC remains unclear. We determined effect of model
NO-donor diethylenetriamine NONOate (DETA-NO) on the
growth rate of prostate cancer cells. Growth of androgendependent LNCaP (Fig. 1A) as well as castration-resistant
22Rv1 (Fig. 1B) cells that endogenously express AR was signiﬁcantly attenuated in response to treatment with DETA-NO.
Similar treatment of PC3 cells that do not express AR with
DETA-NO for up to 24 hours did not evidence a statistically
signiﬁcant effect on the cell proliferation (Fig. 1C), consistent
with previous results (20). Treatment of PC3 cells with DETANO for 48 hours, however, exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease in
the cell proliferation. The treatment with DETA-NO showed no
effect on the LNCaP cell apoptosis, as assessed with PARP
cleavage (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results support the
conclusion that, at concentrations used here, DETA-NO targets
the proliferation machinery of prostate cancer cells.
To test that intracellular NO impacts the cell growth, we
generated a LNCaP cell line that stably overexpressed eNOS
(LNCaP-eNOS; Supplementary Fig. S2A). LNCaP-eNOS cells
evidenced a prolonged doubling time of 95.7 hours, in comparison with the faster doubling time of 55.2 hours for the
control empty-vector (LNCaP-EV) cells (Fig. 1D). Conversely,
the stable knockdown of endogenous eNOS expression with
shRNA (LNCaP-sheNOS; Supplementary Fig. S2A) accelerated
the cell doubling time to 22.7 hours (Fig. 1D). Moreover,
androgen-induced proliferation of LNCaP-eNOS cells was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with LNCaP-EV cells (Fig. 1E).
Together, these results establish exogenously supplied and
endogenously produced NO as proliferation suppressor of
AR-expressing prostate cancer cells.
Effects of modulating NO levels on LNCaP tumor growth in
animals were measured next. LNCaP-EV, LNCaP-eNOS, and
LNCaP-sheNOS cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the
ﬂanks of SCID mice. Results show that while knockdown of
endogenous eNOS accelerated the tumor growth rate, forced
overexpression of eNOS inhibited it, in comparison with control LNCaP-EV tumors (Fig. 2A). Analysis of tumor tissue

6692

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

showed that expression of AR-controlled PSA was reduced in
LNCaP-eNOS, but increased in LNCaP-sheNOS samples (Supplementary Fig. S2B), implying an effect of endogenously
synthesized NO on AR function.
GSNO inhibits castration-resistant prostate tumor
growth
We used LNCaP and LNCaP-derived C4-2 cells as models of
androgen-dependent and ensuing castration-resistant, respectively, prostate cancer to elucidate possible distinguishing
effects of NO on the tumor growth. Tumor-bearing SCID mice
were randomly divided into three groups that were treated
with vehicle (Veh), LHRH, the ﬁrst-line hormone deprivation
therapy for advanced prostate cancer, or GSNO, the most
abundant form of physiologic NO-donor in mammalian cells
(21). Consistent with clinical outcomes, treatment with LHRH
suppressed growth of parental LNCaP tumors but showed no
effect on the growth rate of LNCaP C4-2 tumors (Fig. 2B).
Remarkably, the treatment with GSNO inhibited growth of
both LNCaP and LNCaP C4-2 tumors (Fig. 2B), but showed no
effects on the overall health of animals as measured with intact
body weight and physical activity. Furthermore, pathology
review of heart, lung, spleen, and liver tissue sections indicated
lack of GSNO toxicity, consistent with previous results (22).
Cotreatment of animals harboring LNCaP C4-2 tumors with
LHRH and GSNO did not further decrease the tumor growth
rate in comparison with treatment with individual LHRH or
GSNO, suggesting they act upon common effector(s). These
results establish that endogenously produced as well as exogenously added NO inhibits growth of both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate tumors.
NO attenuates AR activity
LNCaP cell growth is dependent upon AR signaling, and we
tested the idea that NO impacts AR activity. Androgen-induced
activation of endogenous AR, as measured with PSA expression, was signiﬁcantly impaired upon treatment with escalating doses of GSNO (Fig. 3A). Conﬁrmatory results showed that
androgen-induced AR activation, as measured with ARresponse element (ARE)–controlled luciferase reporter, was
also reduced in LNCaP cells treated with GSNO or DETA-NO
(Supplementary Fig. S3A), and mirroring results were obtained
in LNCaP-eNOS cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Concordantly,
the knockdown of endogenous eNOS expression increased PSA
levels, but had no effect on total AR protein expression (Fig.
3B). These results suggest that NO represses the inducible
activation of AR in prostate cancer cells.
AR-null prostate cancer PC3 cells were used to illustrate
whether AR is directly regulated by NO. AR activity was
measured by detection of endogenous AR-regulated FKBP51
gene. FKBP51 mRNA was detected only in cells expressing AR
and treated with R1881 (Fig. 3C), justifying use of this assay to
measure AR activation. Signiﬁcantly, the androgen-induced
FKBP51 mRNA levels were dose-dependently decreased upon
treatment with GSNO in PC3-AR cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting the
effect of NO is directly through modulating AR signaling.
Similarly, PSA gene levels were attenuated in LNCaP cells
treated with GSNO (Fig. 3D).

Activated AR translocates to the nucleus and binds to ARE
in the regulatory regions of AR-target genes. Treatment
with GSNO (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B) or forced overexpression of eNOS (Supplementary Fig. S4C) showed little
effect on the androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation in
LNCaP cells, consistent with previous results (20). However,
the forced overexpression of eNOS (Fig. 3E), like the treatment
with GSNO (Fig. 3F and Supplementary S5A and S5B), significantly reduced the androgen-mediated AR binding to ARE in
the PSA promoter, as determined by ChIP. Also, GSNO dosedependently inhibited the basal AR binding to PSA ARE in
LNCaP cells (Fig. 3G), conﬁrming that NO inhibits AR activity
through interference of its binding to promoter elements in
target genes.

been suggested to mediate NO effects on target cells (21, 23, 24).
Biotin switch assay (25) was performed using prostate cancer
cells treated with escalating doses of NO-donor S-nitrosocysteine (CysNO), a cell-permeable and byproduct of endogenous
GSNO (26). Results establish the posttranslational S-nitrosylation of AR in both LNCaP (Fig. 4A) and 22Rv1 (Fig. 4B) cells. In
addition to full-length AR, the 22Rv1 cells express splicevariants that encode truncated proteins lacking ligand-binding
domain (AR-V) and our results show that both forms of AR
were modiﬁed by S-nitrosylation (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, the Snitrosylation of AR inversely correlates with its transcriptional
activity and is regulated by androgen: treatment with R1881
promoted a reciprocal decrease (2-fold) of AR S-nitrosylation
content and increase (3-fold) of PSA levels (Supplementary Fig.
S6A). Forced overexpression of eNOS resulted in more basal
level SNO-protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S6B) in
comparison with control LNCaP-EV cells, which was further
supported by the measurement of SNO-AR in LNCaP tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S6C).

GSNO inhibits LNCaP C4-2 tumor growth. LNCaP and LNCaP C4-2 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into SCID mice. When tumors formed (about
3
100 to 200 mm ), randomly grouped animals were treated daily with LHRH (100 mg/kg body weight) subcutaneously for 14 days, GSNO (10 mg/kg
body weight) intraperitoneally for 7 days, or vehicle PBS. Tumor volume changes were measured and compared with values before treatment. A Bonferroni
post hoc test following a two-way ANOVA was performed to compare the groups.  , P < 0.05 compared with corresponding control (Veh) tumors. All
results represent three independent experiments.

To identify the cysteine residue(s) corresponding to S-nitrosylation site(s) of AR, S-nitrosylation site identiﬁcation (27)
was performed. Puriﬁcation efﬁciency of AR protein was
conﬁrmed by Coomassie blue staining (Supplementary Fig.
S7A) and Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S7B), and
puriﬁed AR protein S-nitrosylation was demonstrated using
the biotin switch assay (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS)
analysis (22, 28) revealed three cysteine residues (C518,
C601, and C784) as putative S-nitrosylation sites in AR (Supplementary Fig. S7D). Replacement of the individual residues
with serine followed by subjugation of the mutated AR protein
to biotin switch assay indicated C601 as the primary candidate
S-nitrosylation site in AR (Fig. 4C). Notably, both full-length AR
and AR-V proteins contain the C601 residue and are modiﬁed
by S-nitrosylation (Fig. 4B).
We hypothesized that the mutation of S-nitrosylated cysteine residue in AR increases AR activity. However, androgeninduced FKBP51 gene expression conﬁrmed that C601S mutation abolished AR activation (Fig. 4D). C601 resides in the
second zinc ﬁnger of AR DNA-binding domain (DBD), and
mutated C601S AR lacked transcriptional activity (Fig. 4D),
most likely as a result of its inability to coordinate Znþ2 and
bind promoter elements in target genes. In addition to cysteine
thiol, Znþ2 may coordinate two cysteine thiols and two histidine imidazole nitrogens to form a transcriptionally competent zinc ﬁnger domain (29) and we replaced C595 and C601
with histidines (C595/601H) in an attempt to maintain ARbinding ability to ARE. ChIP assays were performed using ARnull PC3 cells ectopically expressing wild-type or C595/601H
mutated forms of AR (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S8A).
Treatment with GSNO signiﬁcantly reduced the wild-type AR
binding to ARE (in FKBP51 promoter), and the binding of
mutated C595/601H AR form was absent. We used EMSA to
conﬁrm the effect of GSNO treatment on AR binding to ARE

6694

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

using nuclear extracts from the PC3 cells expressing wild-type
or C595/601H forms of AR. Mirroring the ﬁndings of the ChIP
assay (Fig. 5A), results show that treatment with GSNO signiﬁcantly decreased the binding of AR to ARE and, again, the
binding of C595/601H AR was absent (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S8B). In agreement with these results, treatment with
GSNO impaired ability of estrogen receptor (ER) to bind EREs
and consequent gene transcription (30) and the S-nitrosylation
of p50 subunit of NF-kB inhibited its binding to target DNA
(31). Together, these ﬁndings evidence the AR S-nitrosylation
that, in turn, impairs its ability to bind ARE, which is required
for target gene expression.
HSP90 transnitrosylates AR
A remaining question is just how NO promotes the AR Snitrosylation. One possibility is that NOS directly binds to AR,
leading to increased local NO levels and AR S-nitrosylation.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments of endogenous AR and
eNOS (that is expressed in LNCaP cells at higher levels than
inducible NOS or neuronal NOS) proteins disputed this idea.
Another possible mechanism is that eNOS regulates AR Snitrosylation indirectly through the binding of common partner HSP90 protein that has been shown to activate eNOS (32)
and to be S-nitrosylated in endothelial cells (33). In epithelial
prostate cells, HSP90 associates with AR and this complex is
maintained in the cytoplasm. Coimmunoprecipitation results
conﬁrmed that HSP90b (the constitutively expressed form of
HSP90) forms a complex with both AR and eNOS (Fig. 6A).
Recent reports have suggested a novel mechanism of NO group
transfer between partner proteins as a general signal transduction mechanism, termed transnitrosylation (34–36). We
hypothesized that AR becomes S-nitrosylated as a result of NO
transfer from S-nitrosylated HSP90. To test this idea, we
incubated puriﬁed AR or HSP90b proteins with CysNO to form
SNO-AR or SNO-HSP90b, respectively. To measure potential

of NO is unidirectional. The transfer of NO from SNO-HSP90b
to AR was observed using puriﬁed proteins, suggesting the
reaction is thermodynamically favorable.
We examined feasibility of AR transnitrosylation by SNOHSP90b under in situ conditions. PC3 cells ectopically expressing Flag-AR alone (Fig. 6D) or together with Myc-HSP90b (Fig.
6E) were treated, or not, with CysNO, followed by biotin switch
assay. Relative levels of SNO-AR and SNO-HSP90b were used to
calculate the relative redox potential (DE0 ) and the associated
change in Gibbs free energy (DG0 ), as described previously
(35). The results show a DE0 of 22.38  3.11 mV and a DG0 of
2.16  0.3 kJ/mol, conﬁrming a net energy gain for the
transfer of NO from SNO-HSP90b to AR and supporting the
conclusion that the transnitrosylation reaction occurs spontaneously in cells.

Discussion
AR plays a central role in the initiation and progression of
prostate cancer and serves as a primary target for developing
drugs to treat patients with advanced disease. AR consists of
three demarcated domains: a variable N-terminus domain that
is involved in receptor transactivation and cofactor recruitment, a centrally located DBD that contains two zinc ﬁnger
motifs, and a C-terminus that encompasses the ligand binding
domain (LBD). Although initially effective in the treatment of

6696

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

locally advanced and metastatic diseases, antiandrogens that
target LBD have failed to achieve sustained inhibition of AR
signaling, or to cure prostate cancer (4). Recently developed
next generation antiandrogen MDV3100 (37) evidenced added
survival beneﬁt to patients with CRPC, but the clinical
improvements remain short-lived (4, 38), providing rationale
to ﬁnd other targets in AR to better treat patients with
advanced disease.
Metastatic and CRPC lesions express AR deletion mutant
forms (collectively referred to as AR-V) that lack the LBD (39,
40), and recent work shows AR-V to be transcriptionally active
(41, 42). Emerging clinical outcomes suggest that expression of
AR-V is increased in CRPC and metastatic lesions, and may
facilitate progression of prostate cancer in patients undergoing
hormonal therapy (40, 43). In animals, interference of AR-V
activation attenuates growth of model CRPC tumors (41).
Hence, in addition to full-length AR, AR-V may serve as drug
targets to inactivate the receptor. Our results show that Snitrosylation of C601, located in AR DBD and shared by fulllength AR and AR-V, inhibits AR function and growth of CRPC
tumors. The sequential targeting of distinct domains in AR may
provide a more sustained beneﬁt to patients diagnosed with
metastatic and CRPC diseases.
Our data show that C601 is a primary target of NO, and that
S-nitrosylation at this site inhibits AR activity. C601 is located
in the second zinc ﬁnger motif of the AR DBD and is required

prostate cancer with low-dose and sustained delivery of NOdonor nitroglycerin signiﬁcantly inhibited disease progression
as measured with a decrease in PSA doubling time (45),
implying that NO abundance inhibits prostate cancer in men.
Results of perturbing endogenous levels of NO on the tumor
growth rate support the conclusion that NO acts directly on the
cancer cells; forced overexpression of eNOS in the cancer cells
inhibits tumor growth, whereas knockdown of endogenous
eNOS expression accelerates it. However, it remains feasible
that the cell-permeable NO impacts other constituents in the
tumor mass, such as vascular cells and supporting stroma.
In summary, our results show that increased levels of
intracellular NO promotes AR inactivation by S-nitrosylation
of a single C601 residue present in the AR DBD and inhibits

for AR binding to AREs. The S-nitrosylation of C601 effectively
inhibits AR transcriptional activity, likely as a result of NO
destroying zinc-sulfur clusters (44). In the absence of androgen
stimulation, AR is expressed in the cytoplasm in complex with
HSP90. Available evidence shows that HSP90 binds eNOS and
undergoes the S-nitrosylation modiﬁcation (32), and our
results show that SNO-HSP90 transnitrosylates AR. Hence,
HSP90 may contribute to maintenance of AR inactivation by
a two-step mechanism; sequestration in the cytoplasm and Snitrosylation. Androgen-induced activation of AR, therefore,
may involve AR signal disinhibition as a result of AR dissociation from HSP90 in the cytoplasm, translocation to the
nucleus and denitrosylation. Indeed, our preliminary results
support the idea that stimulation with androgen provokes a
decrease in nuclear AR S-nitrosylation content and a concomitant increase in PSA expression.
The preclinical studies show that systemic treatment of
animals harboring xenograft prostate tumors with exogenously supplied NO (i.e., GSNO) inhibits growth of both androgendependent and castration-resistant tumors. Remarkably,
results of a nonrandomized phase II trial show that treatment
of patients who failed primary therapy for clinically localized

a result of being sequestered in the cytoplasm and transnitrosylated by HSP90. Sequential targeting of individual AR
domains with pharmacologically distinct agents may provide
a better treatment outcome to more effectively abrogate
aberrant and sustained AR signaling in advanced prostate
cancer.
