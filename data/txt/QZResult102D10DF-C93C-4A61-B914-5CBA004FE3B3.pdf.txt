ABSTRACT
In spite of advances in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL), a significant number of children with ALL are not cured of their disease. We and
others have shown that signaling from the bone marrow microenvironment confers
therapeutic resistance, and that the interaction between CXCR4 and stromal cellderived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12) is a key mediator of this effect. We demonstrate
that ALL cells that upregulate surface CXCR4 in response to chemotherapy treatment
are protected from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis when co-cultured with bone
marrow stroma. Treatment with the CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor diminishes stromal
protection and confers chemosensitivity. Using xenograft models of high-risk
pediatric ALL, plerixafor plus chemotherapy induces significantly decreased leukemic
burden, compared to chemotherapy alone. Further, treatment with plerixafor and
chemotherapy influences surface expression of CXCR4, VLA-4, and CXCR7 in surviving
ALL blasts. Finally, prolonged exposure of ALL blasts to plerixafor leads to a persistent
increase in surface CXCR4 expression, along with modulation of surface expression of
additional adhesion molecules, and enhanced SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis, findings
that may have implications for therapeutic resistance. Our results suggest that while
CXCR4 inhibition may prove useful in ALL, further study is needed to understand the
full effects of targeting the leukemic microenvironment.

INTRODUCTION

chemokine SDF-1 is thought to be an essential component
of these interactions. CXCR4 is commonly expressed on
the surface of ALL and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
cells.[11] Similar to its role in hematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) regulation, activation of CXCR4 by SDF1 is critical for the migration and retention of leukemia
cells within the bone marrow and may play a role in
extramedullary spread.[12] Because the SDF-1/CXCR4
axis is important in attracting and retaining leukemia
cells within the bone marrow microenvironment, CXCR4
inhibition could allow leukemia cells to be released
from protective niches that contribute to chemotherapy
resistance. Plerixafor (Mozobil, formerly AMD3100) is
a reversible inhibitor of CXCR4 that is approved by the

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the
most common childhood cancer. Due to advances in
diagnosis and treatment, over 80% of children with
ALL are cured with contemporary treatment regimens.
However, a significant proportion of pediatric ALL recur
due to chemotherapy resistance. We and others have
demonstrated that signaling between leukemia cells and
stromal cells in the bone marrow microenvironment
contributes to leukemia cell growth and survival, and
that co-culture with normal human bone marrow stroma
mediates therapeutic resistance.[1-10] The association

between cell lines (Fig. 1A). Next, we treated the cell
lines with the highest and lowest surface expression of
CXCR4 with a dose range of plerixafor over a 24 hour
time course to determine the potency, onset, and duration
of CXCR4 inhibition. To assess the ability of plerixafor
to inhibit surface CXCR4, we stained cells with the
12G5 clone of the anti-CXCR4 antibody, which attaches
to the SDF-1 and drug-binding site of CXCR4. In spite
of variations in baseline surface CXCR4 expression, the
ability of plerixafor to inhibit 12G5 antibody binding
was consistent across cell lines, with dose-dependent
inhibition of 12G5 antibody binding starting at 1 hour that
was maintained through 24 hours (Figs. 1B-1C). We also
found that plerixafor was able to inhibit 12G5 antibody
binding in the remaining 3 cell lines (Supplemental
Figs. 1A-1C), suggesting that plerixafor can inhibit
CXCR4 effectively at various levels of baseline surface
CXCR4 expression. Next, we wanted to model a
treatment-refractory or residual disease state by treating
ALL cell lines with non-lethal doses of chemotherapy
and determining if the surviving cells show increased
interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment. We
chose Nalm-6 and RS4;11, which had the highest baseline
surface CXCR4 expression, to investigate our hypothesis.
Our treatment schema is shown in Fig. 2A. Pretreatment
with chemotherapy led to an increase in surface CXCR4
expression in surviving cells, compared to pretreatment
with vehicle control (Figs. 2B-2C). Next, we exposed
the pretreated cells to dose ranges of chemotherapy
in 3 culture conditions: 1) off stroma, 2) on stroma, or
3) treated with plerixafor and then plated on stroma
(Fig. 2A). After treatment, we measured apoptosis and
calculated inhibitory concentration values (IC10 through
IC90). Using the IC values, we calculated a Protective
Index (PI) and a Reversal Index (RI). We defined the PI
as the IC values on stroma divided by the IC values off
stroma; therefore, PI >1 indicated stromal protection.[10]
For the RI, we divided the IC values of the plerixafor +
stroma condition by the IC values off stroma; thus, RI

HSC mobilizing agent. Preclinical studies[3,6-10,13,14]
and clinical trials[15-17] using plerixafor have suggested
that CXCR4 inhibition is an effective means to enhance
sensitivity to anti-leukemic therapies and mobilize
leukemic blasts.
Therapy resistance in high-risk, relapsed, and/
or refractory pediatric ALL may be partly mediated by
increased interaction between residual leukemic blasts
and the bone marrow microenvironment. Therefore,
interruption of these interactions through CXCR4
antagonism could augment the effects of chemotherapy
and improve overall outcome in these children. In this
study, we demonstrate that chemotherapy-induced
upregulation of surface CXCR4 expression in surviving
leukemic blasts is a mechanism of therapeutic resistance
in ALL. We also show that this therapeutic resistance
can be reversed with plerixafor. Using a xenograft model
of high-risk pediatric ALL, we also demonstrate that
CXCR4 inhibition with plerixafor enhances sensitivity
to chemotherapy. We also show that in vivo treatment
with chemotherapy and plerixafor leads to modulation
of surface expression of CXCR4 and other adhesion
molecules in surviving leukemic blasts. Finally, we offer
evidence that prolonged inhibition of CXCR4 leads
to an increase in surface CXCR4 expression as well as
modulation of additional adhesion pathways, suggesting a
mechanism of resistance to CXCR4 inhibition.

chemotherapy in an in vivo NSG xenograft model (Table
1 for sample characteristics). We used primary samples
of infant MLL-R ALL because these patients have a
very poor outcome, and these samples readily engraft
in immunodeficient mice and demonstrate enhanced
survival with stromal co-culture.[9] After a two-week
period of engraftment, we treated the mice with vehicle
control, plerixafor, or cytarabine using two different
dosing schedules. We chose cytarabine because of its
efficacy against infant ALL.[18] In dosing schedule A, we
administered single doses of vehicle control, plerixafor
(5 mg/kg), cytarabine alone (100 mg/kg), or plerixafor
followed four hours later by cytarabine in order to allow
maximum interruption of leukemia-stromal interactions
(Fig. 3A). Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after treatment
and cells were isolated from bone marrow, spleen, liver,
and peripheral blood and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Overall, leukemic burden in the bone marrow was similar
in control-, cytarabine-, and plerixafor-treated mice,
consistent with conservative dosing of cytarabine and
minimal direct anti-leukemic effect of plerixafor (Fig.
3B). Interestingly, both plerixafor alone and cytarabine
alone induced increased leukemic burden in the spleen

protected control-pretreated Nalm-6 (Fig. 2D) and RS4;11
(Fig. 2E) from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Notably,
stroma differentially protected chemotherapy-pretreated
cells from additional chemotherapy-induced apoptosis,
suggesting that chemotherapy-induced upregulation of
surface CXCR4 led to higher protective indices. Further,
plerixafor preferentially decreased stromal protection to a
greater degree in chemotherapy-pretreated cells, compared
to control-pretreated cells (Figs. 2D-2E), suggesting that
the degree of surface CXCR4 upregulation potentiates
the ability of plerixafor to reverse stromal protection.
Our findings suggest that chemotherapy exposure induces
an increase in stromal protection that is at least in part
mediated by CXCR4.

experiments,[9] we used three treatment cohorts for these
experiments: vehicle control, cytarabine alone (200 mg/
kg), and plerixafor (5 mg/kg) followed by cytarabine four
hours later (Fig. 3C). This treatment strategy was much
more effective, as cytarabine significantly decreased
leukemic burden in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, and
peripheral blood, compared to vehicle control. Notably,
the combination of plerixafor and cytarabine significantly
reduced leukemic burden, compared to both vehicle
control and to cytarabine alone (Fig. 3D), suggesting
that plerixafor enhanced sensitivity to cytarabine in
this model. The efficacy of this treatment strategy was
variable by patient sample but, in general, each sample
showed increased efficacy of plerixafor and cytarabine
(Supplemental Figs. 2A-2D). Histopathologic examination
of the bone marrow and spleen also demonstrated
restoration of normal hematopoietic elements and
normalization of splenic architecture in mice treated with
plerixafor and cytarabine (Supplemental Fig. 2E). From
these experiments, we concluded that CXCR4 inhibition
may be an effective strategy to increase chemosensitivity
in infant MLL-R ALL.

compared to control-treated mice. Further, this treatment
strategy showed minimal effects on circulating leukemic
blasts. However, even with the use of a modest dose of
cytarabine, the combination of plerixafor and cytarabine
resulted in significantly decreased leukemic burden in
the spleen and liver, as well as a trend toward decreased
leukemic burden in the bone marrow, compared to
cytarabine alone.
In dosing strategy B, we increased the dose of
cytarabine and intensified the overall therapy by treating
on three consecutive days for two weeks (Fig. 3C). Given
that plerixafor did not significantly affect leukemic burden
in the bone marrow in these experiments and our prior

alpha subunit of VLA-4, which is an integrin that binds
to fibronectin and VCAM-1 among other ligands in the
bone marrow microenvironment.[19,20] CXCR7 is the
second receptor for SDF-1 and is also a receptor for the
chemokine CXCL11.[21] We found that CD49d surface
expression was highest in leukemic blasts residing in the
bone marrow, followed by spleen, liver, and peripheral
blood, which was the opposite pattern of CXCR4 (Fig.
4C). In contrast, surface expression of CXCR7 was
lowest in leukemic blasts isolated from the bone marrow
and relatively similar among the other organs (Fig. 4D).
Interestingly, treatment with cytarabine with or without
plerixafor led to statistically significant increases in both
CD49d (Fig. 4E) and CXCR7 surface expression (Fig.
4F). In summary, these findings suggest that anti-leukemic
therapies affect surface expression of multiple adhesion
molecules in surviving leukemic blasts, perhaps as a
compensatory response to CXCR4 inhibition.

We wanted to verify our in vitro findings that
chemotherapy modulated surface CXCR4 expression in
our in vivo model. Therefore, we measured surface CXCR4
expression in leukemic blasts at the time of sacrifice. In all
primary samples, surface CXCR4 expression in controltreated mice was highest in leukemic blasts harvested
from the peripheral blood, followed by liver, spleen,
and bone marrow (Fig. 4A). Surface CXCR4 expression
of control-treated cells did not appear to correlate with
engraftment or response to therapy. However, surface
CXCR4 expression was significantly modulated by
cytarabine treatment with or without plerixafor (Fig. 4B),
suggesting that anti-leukemic therapies may affect surface
expression of CXCR4 in surviving leukemic blasts in vivo.
Specifically, we observed consistent downregulation of
CXCR4 by cytarabine treatment in blasts taken from the
liver and blood; this pattern was not significant in blasts
isolated from the bone marrow or spleen. Given these
findings, we performed an extended analysis on two of
the primary samples to determine if we could observe
patterns of expression of other adhesion molecules.
Specifically, we measured surface expression of CD49d
and CXCR7 by flow cytometry. CD49d is the integrin

from each treatment condition for an additional 72 hours to
determine if these changes in surface CXCR4 expression
persisted and if they led to functional consequences.
After withdrawal of plerixafor, 12G5 binding increased
to untreated levels between 4 and 24 hours, while 1D9
and 2B11 binding decreased to untreated levels between 4
and 72 hours (Supplemental Figs. 5A-5D). To determine
if these observed increases in surface CXCR4 expression
were functional, we measured migration of washed cells
from each treatment condition through a permeable
membrane toward medium containing SDF-1α or medium
alone. Despite CXCR4 inhibition for 72 hours, all
plerixafor-treated cells migrated in response to SDF-1α. In
addition, some plerixafor-treated cells exhibited increased
SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis compared to control-treated
cells (Figs. 6C-6D). These findings imply that increases
in surface CXCR4 induced by 72 hours of treatment with
plerixafor are functional. Our results are in stark contrast
to a previous report showing that short-term treatment
with plerixafor results decreased SDF-1α-induced
chemotaxis.[3] Therefore, we hypothesized that there is
a therapeutic window for the use of plerixafor, during
which an overall increase in surface CXCR4 expression
is balanced by inhibition at the SDF-1 binding site. To
investigate this, we treated Nalm-6 and HB-1119 with
plerixafor for 72 hours and collected cells at multiple time
points for flow cytometry and chemotaxis. We found a
rapid and potent inhibition of 12G5 antibody binding that
was paralleled by an increase in 1D9 and 2B11 antibody
binding. However, over time, inhibition of 12G5 antibody
binding waned while increases in 1D9 and 2B11 binding
persisted (Figs. 6E-6F). We were able to demonstrate
that these differences in 12G5 antibody binding were
functional in short chemotaxis assays (Figs. 6G-6H), but
that a 24-hour chemotaxis assay had an opposite effect
(Figs. 6I-6J), likely due to a washout of CXCR4 inhibition
and an overall increase in surface CXCR4. In summary,
our data demonstrate that plerixafor is an effective
inhibitor of CXCR4 in pediatric ALL and that the timing
of administration may be critical to optimizing its use as a
chemosensitizing agent in leukemia.

cytarabine led to modulation of surface CXCR4, CD49d,
and CXCR7 expression in residual leukemic blasts, we
hypothesized that exposure to plerixafor may have led to
increased interactions between surviving leukemic blasts
and the bone marrow microenvironment. To investigate
this, we treated pre-B ALL cell lines with a dose range of
plerixafor over a brief period of time and measured surface
expression of CD49d and CXCR7 by flow cytometry.
CD49d was highly expressed at baseline (Supplemental
Fig. 3A), while CXCR7 was expressed to a lesser degree
(Fig. 5A). Treatment with plerixafor led to no significant
modulation of CD49d surface expression (Supplemental
Figs. 3B-3C). However, plerixafor treatment consistently
led to increased surface CXCR7 expression across cell
lines, suggesting that inhibition of CXCR4 induces
increased surface expression of the second receptor of
SDF-1 (Figs. 5B-5C).
Next, to determine the effects of extended exposure
to plerixafor and subsequent withdrawal, we treated ALL
cell lines with plerixafor for 72 hours. We measured
surface expression of surface CXCR4 using three different
antibodies: 12G5, which attaches to the SDF-1 and drugbinding site of CXCR4, and 1D9 and 2B11, which do not
compete with SDF-1 or drug binding. In pilot experiments,
we verified that the 2B11 antibody bound to human
CXCR4 as previously reported (data not shown).[22]
Immediately after 72 hours of treatment with plerixafor,
12G5 binding was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner
as expected. Surprisingly, 1D9 and 2B11 binding were
increased in an inversely proportional manner to 12G5
binding, suggesting not only that plerixafor caused an
actual increase in surface CXCR4 over time but that the
increase in CXCR4 was directly related to the degree of
CXCR4 inhibition (Figs. 6A-6B). We confirmed these
increases in surface CXCR4 by qRT-PCR (Supplemental
Figs. 4A-4B). Measurement of VLA-4 and CXCR7 by
flow cytometry and qRT-PCR also showed modulation
after 72 hours of treatment with plerixafor (Supplemental
Figs. 4C-4J).
Next, we washed the cells, resuspended them in fresh
medium without plerixafor, and analyzed aliquots of cells

DISCUSSION

grown in co-culture with normal bone marrow stroma.
In this study, we hypothesized that chemotherapyinduced increases in surface CXCR4 expression may
mediate chemotherapy resistance in ALL. Interestingly,
cells with higher levels of surface CXCR4 upregulation
had higher Protective Indices compared to cells with
lower surface CXCR4 upregulation, suggesting that the
degree of surface CXCR4 upregulation is predictive
of the degree of stromal protection. Cells with higher
surface CXCR4 upregulation also had greater differences
between the Protective and Reversal Index, suggesting that
plerixafor diminishes stromal protection more effectively
in leukemias that highly upregulate surface CXCR4 in
response to chemotherapy. These findings are in concert
with our previous findings in AML.[10]
We had previously shown that treatment with

High level surface expression of CXCR4 has been
associated with inferior outcome in pediatric ALL.[23,24]
In this study, we offer further evidence that CXCR4
is an important functional determinant of treatment
response in pediatric ALL. We and others have previously
shown that anti-leukemic agents can modulate CXCR4
expression in ALL,[10,25] AML,[10] chronic lymphocytic
leukemia,[26] and chronic myelogenous leukemia.[27]
Therefore, initial levels and changes in levels of CXCR4
in leukemia cells may affect the protection conferred by
bone marrow niches. In addition, we have previously
demonstrated that AML cases that upregulate surface
CXCR4 in response to chemotherapy are differentially
protected from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis when

plerixafor renders infant MLL-R leukemic blasts more
susceptible to the FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib in a
xenograft model.[9] To increase the applicability of this
treatment strategy in this difficult-to-treat population,
we combined a standard chemotherapeutic agent with
plerixafor in a xenograft model of infant MLL-R ALL.
Our first treatment strategy was minimally effective, likely
due to low intensity of the treatment regimen. Our second
treatment strategy, however, was much more effective and
the combination of plerixafor and cytarabine demonstrated
a significant improvement in leukemic control compared
to cytarabine alone, suggesting that inhibition of the bone
marrow microenvironment may be a means to improve
upon the poor overall and disease-free survival in infant
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MLL-R ALL. Using the xenograft model, we measured
surface expression of CXCR4, VLA-4 (CD49d), and
CXCR7 in surviving leukemic blasts to learn more about
the potential for surviving blasts to interact with the bone
marrow microenvironment.
Surface CXCR4 expression did not correlate with
response to therapy in our xenograft model. This may
be due to a small sample size and we plan to explore
the role of CXCR4 expression in clinical outcome in a
larger cohort of patient samples in future experiments.
Interestingly, surface expression of CXCR4 and CD49d in
leukemic blasts appeared to be in an inverse relationship.
Specifically, CXCR4 expression was highest in leukemia
cells circulating in the peripheral blood and lowest
8954

in those localized to the bone marrow, while CD49d
expression was highest in the bone marrow and lowest
in the peripheral blood. Downregulation of a receptor
often occurs when the ligand is in excess. Thus, it follows
that CXCR4 is lowest where the concentration of SDF1α is the highest (i.e., the bone marrow). In addition, it is
possible that blasts migrating out of the marrow upregulate
surface CXCR4 as they home to new niches. Previous
studies have also suggested that the functions of CXCR4
and VLA-4 are linked. For example, treatment of pre-B
ALL cell lines or primary samples with SDF-1α, which
causes activation and internalization of CXCR4, resulted
in increased adhesion to fibronectin, laminin, and VCAM1, suggesting that SDF-1α and CXCR4 influence the
functionality of VLA-4.[28] Another study showed that
treatment of neutrophils with SDF-1α also led to increased
adhesion to VCAM-1.[29] Therefore, it is possible
that the pattern in organ-specific surface expression of
CXCR4 and CD49d in control-treated mice is part of a
homeostatic relationship. Further, high concentrations of
SDF-1α in the bone marrow may have led to activation
and ligand-receptor-mediated internalization of CXCR4,
which resulted in lower surface CXCR4 expression as well
as activation and increased surface expression of CD49d.
Evidence of the importance of VLA-4 in ALL is shown
in a study demonstrating that treatment of pre-B ALL cell
lines and primary samples with antibodies against VLA4 led to significantly impaired bone marrow homing in
a transplant model using NOD/SCID mice.[30] We also
observed that our treatment led to increases in surface
expression of CD49d and CXCR7. Upregulation of
surface CD49d expression in surviving blasts may be a
compensatory mechanism to overcome CXCR4 inhibition.
Similarly, surviving blasts may have increased CXCR7
surface expression to circumvent CXCR4 antagonism and
to provide additional cell surface receptors to respond to
SDF-1 in the bone marrow microenvironment. CXCR7 is
a scavenger of SDF-1 and participates in SDF-1-mediated
signaling and chemotaxis in concert with CXCR4.[21,31]
Therefore, an increase in surface CXCR7 in residual
leukemic blasts may lead to increased interactions with
the bone marrow microenvironment. More study is needed
to fully understand these phenomena.
We investigated these ideas by treating ALL cells
with plerixafor alone at various doses and periods of
time. Short-term treatment with plerixafor induced an
increase in surface CXCR7 expression, while extended
treatment led to increased CD49d expression. Remarkably,
prolonged exposure to plerixafor led to an overall increase
in surface CXCR4 expression, as measured by 1D9
and 2B11 antibody binding, with a simultaneous dosedependent decrease in 12G5 antibody binding, which
measures blockade of the SDF-1 binding site on CXCR4.
Further, increases in surface CXCR4 expression persisted
for up to 72 hours after withdrawal from plerixafor and
plerixafor-treated cells demonstrated continued and, in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

some cases, enhanced SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis. Shortterm treatment with plerixafor inhibited SDF-1α-induced
chemotaxis in a brief assay, but chemotaxis was enhanced
by SDF-1α over a longer chemotaxis period. These
findings suggest that these increases in surface CXCR4
are functional and that plerixafor-treated ALL blasts may
have the potential to have increased interactions with the
bone marrow microenvironment, highlighting a possible
mechanism of resistance to CXCR4 inhibition. Therefore,
the dosing of plerixafor (i.e., daily or constant exposure vs.
intermittent or short-term exposure) is likely to impact its
effectiveness as a chemosensitizing agent in ALL.
We and others have demonstrated that inhibition of
CXCR4 enhances sensitivity to anti-leukemic therapy, and,
CXCR4 inhibition has the potential to improve outcome in
both high-risk ALL and AML. For example, we previously
demonstrated that inhibition of CXCR4 with plerixafor
enhances the cytotoxic effects of FLT3 inhibitors in
MLL-R infant ALL[9] and chemotherapy in AML with
internal tandem duplications of FLT3.[10] CXCR4
inhibition as a chemosensitization strategy has also
moved into clinical trials. A phase 1/2 study that combined
plerixafor with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine
in adults with relapsed or refractory AML demonstrated
tolerability and a complete response (CR) rate of 39%
and a combined CR and CR with incomplete blood count
recovery (CRi) rate of 46%.[15] The preliminary results
of two other clinical trials have been reported in abstract
form. A phase 1 study in adults with newly-diagnosed
AML tested the combination of plerixafor with the
standard “7+3” regimen of cytarabine and daunorubicin.
Preliminary results from 21 patients demonstrated a CR
rate of 67% and a CR+CRi rate of 76%.[16] A phase 1 trial
in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory
ALL, AML, or myelodysplastic syndrome combined
plerixafor with high-dose cytarabine and etoposide. The
regimen was well-tolerated and there were no doselimiting toxicities. The combined CR+CRi rate in this
heterogeneous patient population was 16.7%.[17] All
of these trials administered plerixafor for at least five
consecutive days. While these results are promising for
this strategy, the leukemic microenvironment is complex
and has many other interactions that are of potential
importance. We have shown that continuous CXCR4
inhibition with plerixafor may cause unintended effects
on expression of molecules that mediate cell migration
and adhesion, which may then influence how surviving
blasts interact with the bone marrow microenvironment.
It is possible that intensification of the anti-leukemic
treatment backbone and/or the inclusion of additional
microenvironment-targeted agents may overcome these
potential shortcomings. Therefore, additional careful
studies of CXCR4 inhibitors and other microenvironmenttargeted agents must be performed in order to determine
their optimal use in ALL.

METHODS

culture. The 96 well plate stroma cultures were washed
3 times with PBS prior to the addition of leukemia cells.
Cells were then harvested and stained with Annexin V-PE
and 7-AAD, evaluated by flow cytometry, and analyzed
with FlowJo. Inhibitory concentration (IC) values were
calculated using Calcusyn (Biosoft, Cambridge, U.K.)
and used to calculate the Protective Index and Reversal
Index.[10]

Cell culture
ALL cell lines (697, HB-1119, Nalm-6, RS4;11,
and SEMK2) were purchased from ATCC and DSMZ.
Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento,
CA), 1% 100x penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and
1% 200 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen). Normal human
bone marrow was collected from healthy adult bone
marrow transplant donors according to a Johns Hopkins
institutional review board-approved protocol. Stromal
cells were isolated and maintained as previously described
and plated into 96-well tissue culture plates for leukemiastroma co-culture experiments.[9,10]

Xenograft model: primary transplant, secondary
transplant, treatment
Diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood
samples were collected under institutional review boardapproved protocols from newly diagnosed children with
ALL. At the time of collection, mononuclear cells were
isolated by Ficoll density centrifugation and red blood cell
lysis. Mononuclear cells were then viably cryopreserved in
90% FBS with 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen.
Vials of primary ALL cells were thawed and resuspended
in RPMI, counted, and resuspended in cold PBS. Prior
to transplant, the percentage of leukemic blasts in each
sample (co-expressing human CD45 and human CD19)
was determined by flow cytometry. Adult NOD/SCID/
γcnull mice (NSG, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME)
were sublethally irradiated (200 centiGray) 4 hours prior
to transplantation and 1x106 primary ALL cells were
transplanted via tail vein injection. All NSG mice were
started on Uniprim medicated feed (Harlan Laboratories,
Frederick, MD) at least 24 hours prior to transplantation
to decrease opportunistic infections. Four to six weeks
post-transplant, peripheral blood was collected via
cheek venipuncture and analyzed by flow cytometry for
the presence of leukemic blasts. The xenografts were
sacrificed two to four weeks after successful engraftment
and leukemic cells were harvested from the spleen and
bone marrow: flow cytometry was performed at the time
of harvest to quantify the percentage of leukemic blasts.
Leukemic blasts (1x106 per mouse) were then secondarily
transplanted into sublethally irradiated NSG mice for
treatment experiments. After a two-week period of
engraftment, treatment was initiated as described above.
After treatment, cells were isolated from the bone marrow,
spleen, liver, and peripheral blood and flow cytometry was
performed.

Flow cytometry
Cells were stained with various antibodies (CXCR4
12G5-APC, eBioscience, San Diego, CA; CXCR4
12G5-PE-Cy5; CXCR4 1D9-PE; CXCR4 2B11-APC,
eBioscience; CD49d-PE-Cy5; CXCR7-PerCP, R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and read on a FACSCalibur
(BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). All antibodies were
purchased from BD Biosciences unless otherwise
noted. Results were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star,
Inc., Ashland, OR). Gates were drawn around the live
populations as determined by forward scatter and side
scatter properties, and the geometric mean fluorescence
index (MFI) of live cells was calculated. MFI results
were normalized to the MFI of the corresponding isotype
control.

Apoptosis assays
Stock solutions of cytarabine (AraC), daunorubicin,
and vincristine were prepared according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) and stored at -80°C until ready for use. Cell lines
were pretreated with chemotherapy or vehicle control for
72 hours. After pretreatment, density centrifugation with
Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ)
was used to enrich for viable cells. Flow cytometry was
performed using aliquots from each pretreatment condition
to measure surface CXCR4 expression. Additional
aliquots from each pretreatment condition were treated
with dose ranges of chemotherapy or vehicle control for an
additional 72 hours in three different treatment conditions:
no stromal support, stromal co-culture, or treatment
with plerixafor 5 µM (kindly provided by Genzyme,
Cambridge, MA) for 30 minutes followed by stromal cowww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Chemotaxis
Cells were treated with plerixafor or vehicle control,
washed, resuspended in serum-free RPMI, and seeded
into Millicell hanging cell culture inserts (8 µM pore size,
Millipore, Billerica, MA). Chemotaxis toward serumfree media or serum-free media with human recombinant
SDF-1α (150 ng/mL) (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was
measured as previously described.[10]
