ABSTRACT:
Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for nononcogene- addicted non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and the analysis of multiple
DNA repair genes could improve current models for predicting chemosensitivity. We
investigated the potential predictive role of components of the 53BP1 pathway in
conjunction with BRCA1. The mRNA expression of BRCA1, MDC1, CASPASE3, UBC13,
RNF8, 53BP1, PIAS4, UBC9 and MMSET was analyzed by real-time PCR in 115 advanced
NSCLC patients treated with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients
expressing low levels of both BRCA1 and 53BP1 obtained a median progression-free
survival of 10.3 months and overall survival of 19.3 months, while among those with
low BRCA1 and high 53BP1 progression-free survival was 5.9 months (P <0.0001)
and overall survival was 8.2 months (P=0.001). The expression of 53BP1 refines
BRCA1-based predictive modeling to identify patients most likely to benefit from
platinum-based chemotherapy.

association of inhibitors of PKCσ [1].
The protein BRCA1 plays an important role in the
repair of bulky DNA adducts by nucleotide excision repair
(NER), mainly in the sub-pathway repairing the damage
on actively transcribed DNA (transcription-coupled NER)
[2, 3]. BRCA1 is also a main component of DNA doublestrand break repair through the error-free mechanism
of homologous recombination [4]. The pivotal role of
BRCA1 in double-strand break repair may be modulated
by interaction with other components of homologous
recombination [5]. In preclinical models, BRCA1
expression conferred resistance to cisplatin and sensitivity
to taxanes [6-10], and its predictive role has been
confirmed in several solid tumors, including NSCLC [1115]. In particular, the results of a prospective phase II trial
demonstrated the feasibility of assessing BRCA1 mRNA
expression by real-time PCR in the clinical setting, and
additional retrospective analyses indicated that other DNA
repair components could modulate the BRCA1 predictive
model. The retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in
the trial showed that mRNA expression levels of receptor
associated protein 80 (RAP80), which is involved in the
recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA damage sites, was able
to refine the BRCA1-based predictive model in patients
expressing low levels of BRCA1 treated with platinumbased chemotherapy [16].
The protein BRCA1 is recruited at the sites of DNA
damage through a mechanism that includes the localization
of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex at doublestrand break sites, the activation of phosphoinositide-3kinase-like kinases (PIKKs), including ATM and DNAPK, and the phosphorylation of histone H2AX proteins
[17]. This process leads to the binding of mediator of
DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1), which initiates
the assembly of the DNA repair complexes. The protein
MDC1 is also a target for specific cleavage by CASPASE
3, a major component of the apoptotic pathway. This
specific cleavage between the forkhead-associated (FHA)
and breast cancer C-terminal (BRCT) domains can prevent
the activation of DNA damage repair [18]. MDC1 also
recruits the UBC13-RNF8 complex, which facilitates the
accumulation of BRCA1 at damaged DNA through posttranslational protein modification (ubiquitination) [17, 19,
20] (Figure 1).
The 53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) plays an important
role in modulating BRCA1-driven DNA damage response
[21, 22]. 53BP1 was originally identified as being able
to bind to wild-type – but not to mutant – p53 [23].
Later, preclinical data showed that 53BP1 is also able to
mediate double-strand break repair, particularly through
error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) [24].
53BP1 modulates the chromatin structure at DNA damage
sites and contributes to maintaining genomic stability
[25]. In addition, it negatively regulates homologous
recombination repair by inhibiting CTIP [22], which
creates a complex with BRCA1 to promote homologous
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

recombination. While 53BP1 has been found to localize
at both endogenous and exogenous double-strand breaks
in a cell-cycle dependent manner, the phosphorylated
forms have been detected only in response to exogenous
double-strand breaks generated by ionizing radiation and
mediated by ATM and DNA-PK [26].
The 53BP1 pathway is activated after the
recruitment of RNF8-UBC13 by MDC1, but it can also
be mediated by methyltransferase multiple myeloma SET
domain (MMSET), which is overexpressed in several solid
tumors [27, 28] (Figure 1). The function of 53BP1 in DNA
repair is also positively modulated by sumoylation, a posttranslational protein modification induced by PIAS4 and
UBC9 [29] (Figure 1).
However, to the best of our knowledge, the potential
predictive role of the 53BP1 pathway has not yet been
examined in advanced NSCLC in the clinical setting.
In order to shed light on the potential influence
of components of the 53BP1 pathway on the BRCA1
predictive model, we retrospectively analyzed the
expression levels of BRCA1, MDC1, CASPASE3, RNF8,
UBC13, 53BP1, PIAS4, UBC9 and MMSET (Figure 1)
in tumors from advanced NSCLC patients and correlated
our results with outcome to first-line platinum-based
chemotherapy.

RESULTS
Clinical outcome
The median PFS of the overall study population
(115 patients) was 7 months (95% CI, 6.6-7.5) and the
median OS was 11 months (95% CI, 7.9-14) for all 115
patients (Figure 2). Radiological response was assessed
in 102 patients (89%). The overall response rate was
35%, including 3 complete radiological responses, and
37% of patients had stable disease as the best radiological
response (Table 1). Performance status (PS) of 0-1 and
female gender were clinical markers of better prognosis.
PFS and OS for the 83 patients with PS 0-1 were 7.4 (95%
CI, 6-8.8) and 12 (95% CI, 5.4-18. 4) months, respectively,
compared to 3 (95% CI, 1-2.5) and 3.8 (95% CI, 2.55) months, respectively, for the 26 patients with PS 2
(P<0.001) (Supplementary Appendix, Figure S1). Female
patients had longer PFS and OS than males (P=0.003)
(data not shown). No association was observed between
smoking status or chemotherapy regimen and outcome
(data not shown).
Six (5%) tumor samples harbored EGFR mutations:
four exon 19 deletions and two L858R mutations in exon
21. The presence of EGFR mutations was not associated
with outcome. At the time of data collection, one of the
six patients had received erlotinib as second-line treatment
for more than one month and another had received

were observed between BRCA1 and 53BP1 (ρ:0.37,

The mRNA expression levels of BRCA1, 53BP1
and UBC9 were significantly higher in tumors with
squamous than in those with non-squamous histology
(Figure 3). This difference was especially striking for
BRCA1, where mRNA levels (expressed as ∆∆CT) were
33.8 for squamous histology and 8.9 for non-squamous
(P<0.0001) (Figure 3). The mRNA expression of BRCA1
also correlated with smoking status; non-smokers had
significantly lower levels of BRCA1 mRNA (5.5 vs 13;
P=0.04) (Supplementary Appendix, Figure S2).
No association was observed between the mRNA
expression of any of the individual genes and PFS or OS.

Based on the rationale of the biological model
shown in Figure 1 and on preclinical data showing
a potential influence of 53BP1 on the sensitivity of
BRCA1-depleted cells to DNA-damaging agents and on
their capacity for homologous recombination repair [22,
30], we then examined the effect on PFS and OS of the
mRNA expression levels of both BRCA1 and 53BP1 in
combination. In particular, we hypothesized that 53BP1
could affect the platinum sensitivity of tumors already
classified according to their levels of BRCA1 mRNA
expression. We, therefore, examined the effect of 53BP1
expression levels on the outcome of patients expressing
low levels of BRCA1 and, separately, on that of patients
expressing high levels of BRCA1. The mRNA expression
of 53BP1 mRNA was successfully analyzed in 74 cases,
and BRCA1 expression was successfully analyzed in 67
(Supplementary Appendix, Table S2). Expression levels
of both genes were available in 62 cases.
Among the patients expressing low levels of
BRCA1, the median PFS was 10.3 months (95% CI,
5.4-15.1) for patients with low levels of 53BP1 and 5.9
months (95% CI, 4.4-7.4) for those with high 53BP1
levels (P<0.0001) (Figure 4A). The median OS was
19.3 months (95% CI, 9.8-28.7) in the presence of low
levels of 53BP1 but decreased to 8.2 (95% CI, 3.9-12.5)
when 53BP1 levels were high (P=0.001) (Figure 4B). In
contrast, among patients with high levels of BRCA1, the
53BP1 mRNA expression did not affect the outcome. The
median PFS was 8.6 months (95% CI, 5.2-12) for patients
with high 53BP1 expression and 3.8 months (95% CI,
0-7.7) for those with low 53BP1 expression (P=0.65)
(Figure 5A). OS was approximately 10 months in both
sub-groups (P=0.62) (Figure 5B).
Overall disease control (including complete
response, partial response and stable disease) was 75% in
the group of patients with low levels of both BRCA1 and

analysis of patients according to histology, and this issue
warrants further investigation.
We found no association between any of the
individual genes and outcome to platinum-based
chemotherapy, which reflects the complexity of the
biological model at the center of the study (Figure 1).
However, we have identified a novel two-gene predictive
model for platinum-treated advanced NSCLC, based
on the mRNA expression of BRCA1 and 53BP1. The
patients who benefited most from first-line platinum-based
treatment were those expressing low levels of both BRCA1
and 53BP1, who attained an impressive median PFS of
10.3 months and OS of 19.3 months. Importantly, these
outcomes were attained in spite of the inclusion of PS 2
patients, which indicates the strength of the predictive
model.
The proteins BRCA1 and 53BP1 are recruited at
DNA damage sites by mainly overlapping mechanisms,
and it seems plausible that the two pathways interact,
modulating the response to double-strand breaks and
creating a balance between error-free homologous
recombination repair and error-prone NHEJ [22] (Figure
1). The 53BP1 nuclear foci formation is specifically
induced by double-strand breaks [33], and a direct
interaction between BRCA1 and 53BP1, the two
protagonists of double-strand break repair, has been
demonstrated in preclinical models, where 53BP1 has
been shown to be a positive transcriptional regulator of
the BRCA1 promoter [34, 35]. In the experimental setting,

53BP1, compared to 60% in patients with low BRCA1 and
high 53BP1 expression.

DISCUSSION
While preclinical findings and retrospective studies
have indicated that BRCA1 is a differential modulator of
outcome to taxane- and platinum-based chemotherapy
[7, 8, 10, 11, 31], to date no results are available to
support the routine clinical use of BRCA1 expression as a
predictive marker. At the same time, increasing knowledge
concerning DNA repair pathways suggests the potential
predictive role of additional DNA repair components
that modulate BRCA1 function. We have examined the
potential predictive role of the mRNA expression of
several genes involved in the 53BP1 pathway.
We observed a different expression pattern
according to histology, with higher levels of BRCA1,
53BP1 and UBC9 expression in squamous cell carcinomas.
These results are consistent with recently published data
on a panel of potential predictive markers of platinum
sensitivity in resected NSCLC patients, where some
DNA repair genes had predictive value only in squamous
cell carcinomas [32]. However, histology did not affect
patient outcome in the present study, suggesting that
perhaps future analyses should be performed separately in
squamous and non-squamous histologies. The low number
of squamous cell carcinomas in our study precluded a sub-

recruits the mediators of DNA repair through ubiquitination, in which RNF8 and UBC13 are involved. This leads to the assembly and the
activation of both the BRCA1 and the 53BP1 pathways. 53BP1 can also be induced by MMSET activation and needs post-translational
modifications induced by PIAS4 and UBC9.

the loss of 53BP1 reduces genomic instability and could
partially restore the homologous recombination capacity
of cells in the absence of BRCA1 [21, 22]. Nevertheless,
experimental models of cells depleted of both BRCA1
and 53BP1 showed high levels of sensitivity to cisplatin
and other agents – greater than that of cells depleted of
only BRCA1 [30] – even though the cells demonstrated a
similar capacity for homologous recombination to that of
cells expressing the two genes [22].
In the present study, we have demonstrated in
the clinical setting that low levels of 53BP1 mRNA are
essential to maintain cisplatin sensitivity in the presence of
low BRCA1 levels, which is consistent with the biological
model (Figure 1). This suggests that in the absence of
BRCA1, the repair of interstrand crosslinks can occur

in a homologous recombination-independent manner,
which could be affected by 53BP1 (Figure 6). In contrast,
in patients expressing high levels of BRCA1, 53BP1
expression did not affect outcome to platinum-based
chemotherapy. We can speculate that in the presence of
high BRCA1 expression, which confers high capacity for
homologous recombination – and consequently, greater
tumor resistance to platinum therapy – 53BP1 might not
be essential for determining platinum sensitivity.
In addition to its predictive value, the model
suggested by the present study could represent a novel
model of synthetic lethality and could be exploited from
the therapeutic point of view as is the case with BRCA1-2
mutated tumors treated with Poly ADP-ribose polymerase
(PARP) inhibitors. In this case, the inhibition of PARP

leads to the accumulation of single-strand breaks that are
converted to double-strand breaks through the stalling and
collapse of replication forks. BRCA1-2 mutations cause
deficient homologous recombination and consequent
unrepaired double-strand breaks, which cause cell death
[36, 37]. This deficient homologous recombination
sensitizes tumor cells to PARP inhibition. Interestingly, the
synthetic lethality attained with PARP inhibition may also
be driven by molecular alterations in genes involved in

homologous recombination, including decreased BRCA1
mRNA expression [38]. In particular, aberrations of the
Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex sensitized cells to
PARP inhibition, even in BRCA1-2 wild-type tumors [39].
The potential therapeutic applications of synthetic lethality
models could involve the clinical development of PARP
inhibitors in the setting of molecularly-driven disease as
well as the use of molecules inhibiting specific BRCA1
protein domains [5].

METHODS

The present study has some limitations, including
its retrospective nature and the relatively small number
of patients with mRNA expression data available for both
BRCA1 and 53BP1. Nevertheless, the highly significant
results and the great difference in the absolute values
of PFS and OS according to mRNA levels of 53BP1
among patients with low BRCA1 expression show a
clear predictive potential for this novel two-gene model.
Our model warrants validation in a larger patient cohort,
and the influence of other biomarkers of sensitivity to
gemcitabine and pemetrexed should also be taken into
account.
In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study to examine the potential predictive role in
lung cancer of a series of DNA repair genes involved in
the 53BP1 pathway. While BRCA1 expression in isolation
was not able to predict sensitivity to platinum-based
chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, we have identified
a novel predictive two-gene model based on the impact
of 53BP1 on BRCA1 function. These findings confirm
biological data on the complex interplay between BRCA1
and 53BP1 and the effect of 53BP1 in cells with low
homologous recombination capacity. They pave the way
for future studies of 53BP1 and other genetic events in
NSCLC that may modulate the gene landscape imposed
by BRCA1.

Study population
Tumor samples from 115 patients with advanced
NSCLC were collected retrospectively. Fifty-two patients
were from the Istituto Oncologico Veneto (Padova, Italy),
51 from the Hospital Sant Pau (Barcelona, Spain), seven
from the Hospital du Cluzeau (Limoges, France), and five
from the Hospital General de Alicante (Alicante, Spain).
Table 1 shows patient clinical characteristics.
The main inclusion criteria were: stage IIIB or IV
NSCLC (sixth TNM staging system); first-line treatment
with carboplatin or cisplatin plus gemcitabine or
pemetrexed; no previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy;
available tumor tissue and clinical data. Informed consent
was obtained from all patients or their guardians. All
the samples were screened for the presence of EGFR
mutations.

from the beginning of treatment to death from any cause.
Radiological response was assessed according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
version 1.0. Median PFS and OS were estimated with
the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with a twosided log-rank test. The Mann-Whitney test was used for
continuous variables and the Chi-Square or Fisher exact
test for categorical variables. Spearman’s correlation
coefficient analysis was used to determine the correlation
among different genes. The association between each
potential prognostic factor and PFS or OS was assessed
with a univariate Cox regression analysis. All analyses
were performed using Statistical Package for Social
Science (SPSS) for Windows version 17 (Chicago, IL).
Significance was set at P≤0.05.
