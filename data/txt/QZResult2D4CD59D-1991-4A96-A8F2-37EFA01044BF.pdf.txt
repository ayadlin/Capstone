Abstract
Tumor cells display progressive changes in metabolism that correlate with malignancy, including
development of a lipogenic phenotype. How stored fats are liberated and remodeled to support
cancer pathogenesis, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that the enzyme
monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is highly expressed in aggressive human cancer cells and
primary tumors, where it regulates a fatty acid network enriched in oncogenic signaling lipids that
promotes migration, invasion, survival, and in vivo tumor growth. Overexpression of MAGL in
non-aggressive cancer cells recapitulates this fatty acid network and increases their pathogenicity
-- phenotypes that are reversed by an MAGL inhibitor. Interestingly, impairments in MAGLdependent tumor growth are rescued by a high-fat diet, indicating that exogenous sources of fatty
acids can contribute to malignancy in cancers lacking MAGL activity. Together, these findings
reveal how cancer cells can co-opt a lipolytic enzyme to translate their lipogenic state into an array
of pro-tumorigenic signals.

The conversion of cells from a normal to cancerous state is accompanied by reprogramming
of metabolic pathways (Deberardinis et al., 2008; Jones and Thompson, 2009; Kroemer and
Pouyssegur, 2008), including those that regulate glycolysis (Christofk et al., 2008; Gatenby
and Gillies, 2004), glutamine-dependent anaplerosis (DeBerardinis et al., 2008;
DeBerardinis et al., 2007; Wise et al., 2008), and the production of lipids (DeBerardinis et
al., 2008; Menendez and Lupu, 2007). Despite a growing appreciation that dysregulated
metabolism is a defining feature of cancer, it remains unclear, in many instances, how such
biochemical changes occur and whether they play crucial roles in disease progression and
malignancy. Answers to these questions are important for identifying metabolic pathways
that are vital to the pathogenesis of cancer.
Among dysregulated metabolic pathways, heightened de novo lipid biosynthesis, or the
development a “lipogenic” phenotype (Menendez and Lupu, 2007), has been posited to play

a major role in cancer. For instance, elevated levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme
responsible for fatty acid biosynthesis from acetate and malonyl CoA, are correlated with
poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, and inhibition of FAS results in decreased cell
proliferation, loss of cell viability, and decreased tumor growth in vivo (Kuhajda et al.,
2000; Menendez and Lupu, 2007; Zhou et al., 2007). FAS may support cancer growth, at
least in part, by providing metabolic substrates for energy production (via fatty acid
oxidation) (Buzzai et al., 2005; Buzzai et al., 2007; Liu, 2006). Many other features of lipid
biochemistry, however, are also critical for supporting the malignancy of cancer cells,
including: 1) the generation of building blocks for newly synthesized membranes to
accommodate high rates of proliferation (DeBerardinis et al., 2008; Deberardinis et al.,
2008), 2) the composition and regulation of membrane structures that coordinate signal
transduction and motility [e.g., lipid rafts (Gao and Zhang, 2008), invadopodia (Stylli et al.,
2008), blebs (Fackler and Grosse, 2008)] and 3) the biosynthesis of an array of protumorigenic lipid signaling molecules. Prominent examples of lipid messengers that
contribute to cancer include: 1) phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3],
which is formed by the action of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and activates protein kinase
B/Akt to promote cell proliferation and survival (Yuan and Cantley, 2008; Zunder et al.,
2008); 2) lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which signals through a family of G-protein coupled
receptors to stimulate cancer aggressiveness (Mills and Moolenaar, 2003; Ren et al., 2006);
and 3) prostaglandins formed by cyclooxygenases, which support migration and tumor-host
interactions (Gupta et al., 2007; Marnett, 1992).

Lipogenesis may thus contribute to cancer by multiple mechanisms. Considering, however,
that newly synthesized fatty acids are rapidly incorporated into neutral- and phospho-lipid
stores (Menendez and Lupu, 2007), each of the aforementioned models necessitates that
cancer cells also possess a complementary lipolytic pathway to liberate stored fatty acids for
metabolic and signaling purposes (Prentki and Madiraju, 2008; Przybytkowski et al., 2007).
The biochemical pathways that regulate lipolysis in cancer cells remain poorly understood.
Here, we use functional proteomic methods to discover a lipolytic enzyme,
monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), that is highly elevated in aggressive cancer cells from
multiple tissues of origin. We show that MAGL, through hydrolysis of monoacylglycerols
(MAGs), controls free fatty acid (FFA) levels in cancer cells. The resulting MAGL-FFA
pathway feeds into a diverse lipid network enriched in pro-tumorigenic signaling molecules
and promotes migration, survival, and in vivo tumor growth. Aggressive cancer cells thus
pair lipogenesis with high lipolytic activity to generate an array of pro-tumorigenic signals
that support their malignant behavior.

RESULTS
Activity-Based Proteomic Analysis of Hydrolytic Enzymes in Human Cancer Cells
To identify enzyme activities that contribute to cancer pathogenesis, we conducted a
functional proteomic analysis of a panel of aggressive and non-aggressive human cancer cell
lines from multiple tumors of origin, including melanoma [aggressive (C8161, MUM2B),
non-aggressive (MUM2C)], ovarian [aggressive (SKOV3), non-aggressive (OVCAR3)], and
breast [aggressive (231MFP), non-aggressive (MCF7)] cancer. Aggressive cancer lines were
confirmed to display much greater in vitro migration and in vivo tumor-growth rates
compared to their non-aggressive counterparts (Figure S1), as previously shown (Jessani et
al., 2004; Jessani et al., 2002; Seftor et al., 2002; Welch et al., 1991). Proteomes from these
cancer lines were screened by activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) using serine
hydrolase-directed fluorophosphonate (FP) activity-based probes (Jessani et al., 2002;
Patricelli et al., 2001). Serine hydrolases are one of the largest and most diverse enzyme
classes in the human proteome (representing ~ 1–1.5% of all human proteins) and play

important roles in many biochemical processes of potential relevance to cancer, such as
proteolysis (McMahon and Kwaan, 2008; Puustinen et al., 2009), signal transduction
(Puustinen et al., 2009), and lipid metabolism (Menendez and Lupu, 2007; Zechner et al.,
2005). The goal of this study was to identify hydrolytic enzyme activities that were
consistently altered in aggressive versus non-aggressive cancer lines, working under the
hypothesis that these conserved enzymatic changes would have a high probability of
contributing to the pathogenic state of cancer cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Serine hydrolase activities were identified from aggressive and non-aggressive cancer cell
proteomes by enrichment with a biotinylated FP probe (Liu et al., 1999) and
multidimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (Jessani et al., 2005).
Among the more than 50 serine hydrolases detected in this analysis (Tables S1-3), two
enzymes, KIAA1363 and MAGL, were found to be consistently elevated in aggressive
cancer cells relative to their non-aggressive counterparts, as judged by spectral counting
(Jessani et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2004). We confirmed elevations in KIAA1363 and MAGL in
aggressive cancer cells by gel-based ABPP, where proteomes are treated with a rhodaminetagged FP probe and resolved by 1D-SDS-PAGE and in-gel fluorescence scanning (Figure
1A). In both cases, two forms of each enzyme were detected (Figure 1A), due to differential
glycoslyation for KIAA1363 (Jessani et al., 2002), and possibly alternative splicing for
MAGL (Karlsson et al., 2001). We have previously shown that KIAA1363 plays a role in
regulating ether lipid signaling pathways in aggressive cancer cells (Chiang et al., 2006). On
the other hand, very little was known about the function of MAGL in cancer.
The heightened activity of MAGL in aggressive cancer cells was confirmed using the
substrate C20:4 MAG (Figure 1B). Since several enzymes have been shown to display
MAG hydrolytic activity (Blankman et al., 2007), we confirmed the contribution that
MAGL makes to this process in cancer cells using the potent and selective MAGL inhibitor
JZL184 (Long et al., 2009a). JZL184 (1 μM, 4 hr) dramatically reduced the MAG hydrolytic
activity of cancer cells (Figure 1B) and selectively blocked the FP-rhodamine signals for
both the 33 and 35 kDa forms of MAGL (Figure 1A). In contrast, JZL184 treatment did not
alter the hydrolytic activity displayed by cancer cells for several additional classes of lipids,
including diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, lysophospholipids, and phospholipids (Figure
S1). These data demonstrate that aggressive cancer cells display highly elevated MAG
activity and most, if not all, of this activity originates from the MAGL enzyme.
MAGL Regulates Free Fatty Acid Levels in Aggressive Cancer Cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MAGL is perhaps best recognized for its role in degrading the endogenous cannabinoid 2arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG, C20:4 MAG), as well as other MAGs, in brain and peripheral
tissues (Dinh et al., 2002; Long et al., 2009a; Long et al., 2009b; Nomura et al., 2008).
Consistent with this established function, blockade of MAGL by JZL184 (1 μM, 4 hr)
produced significant elevations in the levels of several MAGs, including 2-AG, in each of
the aggressive cancer cell lines (Figure 1C and Figure S2). Interestingly, however, MAGL
inhibition also caused significant reductions in the levels of FFAs in aggressive cancer cells
(Figure 1D and Figure S2). This surprising finding contrasts with the function of MAGL in
normal tissues, where the enzyme does not, in general, control the levels of FFAs (Long et
al., 2009a; Long et al., 2009b; Nomura et al., 2008).
Curiously, we noted that, with the exception of C20:4 FFA and MAG, the magnitude of
reduction of FFAs greatly exceeded the corresponding elevation in MAGs (~5000–6100
pmol and 41–75 pmol, respectively, for C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1 lipids). We hypothesized
that this apparent discrepancy in mass balance might be accounted for by the conversion of
elevated MAGs to alternative metabolites in JZL184-treated cancer cells. Consistent with
this premise, lipidomic analyses revealed significant increases in two major classes of

lysophospholipids – lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) and lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine
(LPE) – in JZL184-treated cancer cells (Figure S1 and Table S4). The cumulative magnitude
of elevation of these lysophospholipids (4100–6500 pmol), matched closely the reduction in
FFAs observed in JZL184-treated cells. Notably, we did not detect C20:4 lysophospholipids
in cancer cells, providing a likely explanation for why JZL184 caused similar magnitudes of
elevation and reduction in C20:4 MAG and FFA, respectively. Metabolic labeling studies
using the non-natural C17:0-MAG confirmed that MAGs are converted to LPC and LPE by
aggressive cancer cells, and that this metabolic transformation is significantly enhanced by
treatment with JZL184 (Figure S1). Finally, JZL184 treatment did not affect the levels of
MAGs and FFAs in non-aggressive cancer lines (Figure 1C, D), consistent with the
negligible expression of MAGL in these cells (Figure 1A, B).
We next stably knocked down MAGL expression by RNA interference technology using
two independent shRNA probes (shMAGL1, shMAGL2), both of which reduced MAGL
activity by 70–80% in aggressive cancer lines (Figure 2A, D and Figure S2). Other serine
hydrolase activities were unaffected by shMAGL probes (Figure 2A, D and Figures S2),
confirming the specificity of these reagents. Both shMAGL probes caused significant
elevations in MAGs and corresponding reductions in FFAs in aggressive melanoma (Figure
2B, C), ovarian (Figure 2E, F), and breast cancer cells (Figure S2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Together, these data demonstrate that both acute (pharmacological) and stable (shRNA)
blockade of MAGL cause elevations in MAGs and reductions in FFAs in aggressive cancer
cells. It is furthermore noteworthy that aggressive cancer cells were found to express higher
basal levels of FFAs (and conversely lower levels of MAGs) than non-aggressive cancer
cells (Figure 1C, D), and this altered metabolic profile was largely eradicated by MAGL
inhibition. These intriguing findings indicate that MAGL is the principal regulator of FFA
levels in aggressive cancer cells. Finally, we confirmed that MAGL activity (Figure 3A, B)
and FFA levels (Figure 3C) are also elevated in high-grade primary human ovarian tumors
compared to benign or low-grade tumors. Thus, heightened expression of the MAGL-FFA
pathway is a prominent feature of both aggressive human cancer cell lines and primary
tumors.
Disruption of MAGL Expression and Activity Impairs Cancer Pathogenicity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

shMAGL cancer lines were next examined for alterations in pathogenicity using a set of in
vitro and in vivo assays. shMAGL-melanoma (C8161), ovarian (SKOV3), and breast
(231MFP) cancer cells exhibited significantly reduced in vitro migration (Figure 4A, F and
Figure S2), invasion (Figure 4B, G and Figure S2), and cell survival under serum-starvation
conditions (Figure 4C, H and Figure S2). Acute pharmacological blockade of MAGL by
JZL184 also decreased cancer cell migration (Figure S2), but not survival, possibly
indicating that maximal impairments in cancer aggressiveness require sustained inhibition of
MAGL.
shMAGL-C8161 and SKOV3 cancer cells also exhibited markedly reduced tumor growth
rates in subcutaneous xenograft transplantation studies performed in immune-deficient mice
(Figure 4D, I). Similar impairments in tumor growth rates were observed in C8161 and
SKOV3 xenograft-transplanted mice administered JZL184 once per day (40 mg/kg, p.o.)
(Figure 4E, J), a treatment regime that was confirmed to block MAGL activity in tumors
(Figure S3). Notably, MAGL-disrupted tumors possessed lower FFA levels (Figure S3),
indicating that MAGL maintains its control over fatty acid metabolism in cancer cells grown
in vivo.
Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that MAGL activity supports
several of the aggressive properties exhibited by malignant cancer cells.

MAGL Overexpression Increases FFAs and the Aggressiveness of Cancer Cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next asked whether expressing MAGL in non-aggressive cancer cells might alter their
lipid metabolic profiles and pathogenicity. Stable MAGL-overexpressing (MAGL-OE) and
control [expressing an empty vector or a catalytically inactive version of MAGL, where the
serine nucleophile was mutated to alanine (S122A)] variants of MUM2C and OVCAR3
cells were generated by retroviral infection and evaluated for their respective MAGL
activities by ABPP and C20:4 MAG substrate assays. Both assays confirmed that MAGLOE cells possess greater than 10-fold elevations in MAGL activity compared to control cells
(Figure 5A and Figure S4). MAGL-OE cells also showed significant reductions in MAGs
(Figure 5B and Figure S4) and elevated FFAs (Figure 5C and Figure S4). This altered
metabolic profile was accompanied by increased migration (Figure 5D and Figure S4),
invasion (Figure 5E and Figure S4), and survival (Figure S4) in MAGL-OE cells. None of
these effects were observed in cancer cells expressing the S122A MAGL mutant, indicating
that they require MAGL activity. Also consistent with this premise, both the metabolic and
pathogenic effects observed in MAGL-OE cells were reversed by a single treatment with
JZL184 (1 μM, 4 h) (Figure 5 and Figure S4). Finally, MAGL-OE MUM2C cells also
showed enhanced tumor growth in vivo compared to control cells (Figure 5F). Notably, the
increased tumor growth rate of MAGL-OE MUM2C cells nearly matched that of aggressive
C8161 cells (Figure S4), indicating that MAGL is sufficient to induce a highly tumorigenic
phenotype in melanoma cells. Collectively, these data indicate that the ectopic expression of
MAGL in non-aggressive cancer cells is sufficient to elevate their FFA levels and promote
pathogenicity both in vitro and in vivo.
Metabolic Rescue of Impaired Pathogenicity in MAGL-Disrupted Cancer Cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MAGL could support the aggressiveness of cancer cells by either reducing the levels of its
MAG substrates, elevating the levels of its FFA products, or both. Among MAGs, the
principal signaling molecule is the endocannabinoid 2-AG, which activates the CB1 and
CB2 receptors (Ahn et al., 2008; Mackie and Stella, 2006). The endocannabinoid system has
been implicated previously in cancer progression and, depending on the specific study,
shown to promote (Sarnataro et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2005) or suppress (Endsley et al.,
2007; Wang et al., 2008) cancer pathogenesis. We therefore tested whether enhanced
endocannabinoid signaling (resulting from elevated levels of 2-AG) might mediate the antimigratory effects observed in MAGL-disrupted cancer cells. However, neither a CB1 nor
CB2 antagonist rescued the migratory defects of shMAGL cancer cells (Figure S5). CB1
and CB2 antagonists also did not affect the levels of MAGs or FFAs in cancer cells (Figure
S5). These findings, combined with the low expression levels of CB1 and CB2 receptors in
aggressive cancer cells (Figure S5), argue that MAGL s effects on cancer aggressiveness
were not mediated by endocannabinoid signaling.
Turning our attention to the products of MAGL-catalyzed reactions, we reasoned that, if the
pro-tumorigenic effects of MAGL were mediated by FFAs (or their secondary metabolites),
then the impaired pathogenicity of shMAGL cancer cells might be rescued by treatment with
exogenous sources of fatty acids. In support of this premise, addition of palmitic or stearic
acid (C16:0 and C18:0 FFAs, respectively; 20 μM, 4 h), two principal FFAs regulated by
MAGL in aggressive cancer cells, to shMAGL or JZL184-treated MAGL-OE cancer cells
fully restored their migratory activity (Figure 6A, B and Figure S2). C16:0 and C18:0 FFAs
were also found to stimulate the migratory activity of the non-aggressive cancer cells
MUM2C and OVCAR3 (Figure 6B). We then determined whether increased FFA delivery
could rectify the tumor growth defect observed for shMAGL cells in vivo. Immune-deficient
mice were fed either a normal chow or high-fat diet throughout the duration of a xenograft
tumor growth experiment. Notably, the impaired tumor growth rate of shMAGL-C8161 cells
was completely rescued in mice fed a high-fat diet. In contrast, shControl-C8161 cells

showed equivalent tumor growth rates on a normal versus high-fat diet. The recovery in
tumor growth for shMAGL-C8161 cells in the high-fat diet group correlated with
significantly increases levels of FFAs in excised tumors (Figure 6D).
Collectively, these results indicate that MAGL supports the pathogenic properties of cancer
cells by maintaining tonically elevated levels of FFAs. We next asked whether this
metabolic profile might impact the larger lipid networks of aggressive cancer cells.
MAGL Regulates a Fatty Acid Network Enriched in Pro-Tumorigenic Signals

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We first considered whether the MAGL-FFA pathway might serve as a means to regenerate
NAD+ (via continual fatty acyl glyceride/FFA recycling) to fuel glycolysis, which has been
hypothesized to explain a need for elevated neutral lipid hydrolase activity in cancers
(Przybytkowski et al., 2007). Arguing against this model, though, the NAD+/NADH ratios
and pyruvate and lactate levels were unaltered in shMAGL and MAGL-OE cells relative to
control cells (Figure S5). Another possible reason for increased lipolysis could be to
generate FFA substrates for β-oxidation, which may serve as an important energy source for
cancer cells (Buzzai et al., 2005). However, inhibitors of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1
(CPT1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in β-oxidation (McGarry and Brown, 1997),
did not affect the migratory activity of cancer cells (shControl, shMAGL, or MAGL-OE)
(Figures S5). CPT1 blockade also failed to alter FFA levels in cancer cells, with the
exception of C20:4 FFA, which was elevated only in shControl cells (Figure S5). Additional
studies revealed reduced expression of CPT1 in aggressive cancer cells (data not shown), as
has been reported previously (Deberardinis et al., 2006), providing further evidence against
a role for β-oxidation as a downstream mediator of the pathogenic effects of the MAGLfatty acid pathway.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Considering that FFAs are fundamental building blocks for the production and remodeling
of membrane structures and signaling molecules, perturbations in MAGL might be expected
to affect several lipid-dependent biochemical networks important for malignancy. To test
this hypothesis, we performed lipidomic analyses of cancer cell models with altered MAGL
activity, including comparisons of: 1) MAGL-OE versus control cancer cells (OVCAR3,
MUM2C), and 2) shMAGL versus shControl cancer cells (SKOV3, C8161). Organic
extracts of cancer cells were analyzed using an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) platform that profiles several major lipid families (Chiang et al.,
2006; Saghatelian et al., 2004), and metabolites with significantly altered levels between the
comparison groups were identified using the XCMS software (Smith et al., 2006).
Complementing these global profiles, we also conducted targeted measurements of specific
bioactive lipids (e.g., prostaglandins) that are too low in abundance for detection by standard
lipidomic methods. The resulting data sets were then mined to identify a common signature
of lipid metabolites regulated by MAGL, which we defined as metabolites that were
significantly increased or reduced in MAGL–OE cells and showed the opposite change in
shMAGL cells relative to their respective control groups (Figure 7A, B and Table S4).
Most of the lipids in the MAGL-fatty acid network, including several lysophospholipids
(LPC, LPA, LPE), ether lipids (MAGE, alkyl LPE), phosphatidic acid (PA), and
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), displayed similar profiles to FFAs, being consistently elevated and
reduced in MAGL-OE and shMAGL cells, respectively. Only MAGs were found to show
the opposite profile (elevated and reduced in shMAGL and MAGL-OE cells, respectively).
Interestingly, virtually this entire lipidomic signature was also observed in aggressive cancer
cells when compared to their non-aggressive counterparts (e.g., C8161 versus MUM2C and
SKOV3 versus OVCAR3, respectively; Table S4). These findings demonstrate that MAGL
regulates a lipid network in aggressive cancer cells that consists of not only FFAs and
MAGs, but also a host of secondary lipid metabolites. We were further intrigued to find that

acute inhibition of MAGL by JZL184 produced a distinct secondary lipidomic signature. As
was observed in shMAGL cells, JZL184 treatment caused reductions in LPA and PGE2 in
each of the cancer lines expressing high levels of MAGL (Figure 7C, D and Table S4). In
contrast, and as noted earlier, increases (rather than decreases) in LPCs and LPEs were
observed in JZL184-treated cells (Figure S1 and Table S4). These data indicate that acute
and chronic blockade of MAGL generate distinct metabolomic effects in cancer cells, likely
reflecting the differential outcomes of short- versus long-term depletion of FFAs. Finally,
several additional classes of lipids, including phosphatidylcholines,
phosphatidylethanolamines, ceramides, sphinogine-1-phosphate, cholesterol,
diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols, were not affected by reductions or elevations in
MAGL activity (Table S4), thus underscoring the restricted composition of the fatty acid
network regulated by this enzyme.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Within the MAGL-fatty acid network are several pro-tumorigenic lipid messengers,
including LPA and PGE2, that have been reported to promote the aggressiveness of cancer
cells (Gupta et al., 2007; Mills and Moolenaar, 2003). Metabolic labeling studies confirmed
that aggressive cancer cells can convert both MAGs and FFAs (Figure S1) to LPA and
PGE2 and, for MAGs, this conversion was blocked by JZL184 (Figure S1). Interestingly,
treatment with either LPA or PGE2 (100 nM, 4 hr) rescued the impaired migration of
shMAGL cancer cells at concentrations that did not affect the migration of shControl cells
(Figure 7E). Conversely, the enhanced migratory activity of MAGL-OE cancer cells was
completely blocked by the Gi/Go inhibitor pertussis toxin (Figure 7F). Finally, the degree of
stimulated migration observed in MAGL-OE cells equaled the maximal effect produced by
exogenous addition of LPA (Figure 7G). Taken together, these data suggest that MAGL
contributes to cancer pathogenicity, at least in part, by elevating the production of bioactive
lipids that act on G-protein-coupled receptors to promote high migratory activity. To assess
whether the MAGL-fatty acid network interacts with other pro-tumorigenic signaling
systems, we treated shMAGL and shControl cells with an inhibitor of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR). shMAGL cells show significantly heightened sensitivity to the antimigratory (Figure 7H and Figure S6) and anti-survival (Figure S6) effects of EGFR
blockade. These data are consistent with previous findings indicating substantial crosstalk
between LPA and EGFR signaling pathways in cancer cells (Bektas et al., 2005; Gschwind
et al., 2002).

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Heightened lipogenesis is an established early hallmark of dysregulated metabolism and
pathogenicity in cancer (Menendez and Lupu, 2007). Cancer lipogenesis appears to be
driven principally by FAS, which is elevated in most transformed cells and important for
survival and proliferation (De Schrijver et al., 2003; Kuhajda et al., 2000; Vazquez-Martin et
al., 2008). It is not yet clear how FAS supports cancer growth, but most of the proposed
mechanisms invoke pro-tumorigenic functions for the enzyme s fatty acid products and their
lipid derivatives (Menendez and Lupu, 2007). This creates a conundrum, since the fatty acid
molecules produced by FAS are thought to be rapidly incorporated into neutral- and
phospho-lipids, pointing to the need for complementary lipolytic pathways in cancer cells to
release stored fatty acids for metabolic and signaling purposes (Prentki and Madiraju, 2008;
Przybytkowski et al., 2007). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that acute treatment
with the FAS inhibitor C75 (40 μM, 4 h) did not reduce FFA levels in cancer cells (data not
shown). Furthermore, aggressive and non-aggressive cancer cells exhibited similar levels of
FAS (data not shown), indicating that lipogenesis in the absence of paired lipolysis may be
insufficient to confer high levels of malignancy.

Here we show that aggressive cancer cells do indeed acquire the ability to liberate FFAs
from neutral lipid stores as a consequence of heightened expression of MAGL. MAGL and
its FFA products were found to be elevated in aggressive human cancer cell lines from
multiple tissues of origin, as well as in high-grade primary human ovarian tumors. These
data suggest that the MAGL-FFA pathway may be a conserved feature of advanced forms of
many types of cancer. Further evidence in support of this premise originates from gene
expression profiling studies, which have identified increased levels of MAGL in primary
human ductal breast tumors compared to less malignant medullary breast tumors (Gjerstorff
et al., 2006). The key role that MAGL plays in regulating FFA levels in aggressive cancer
cells contrasts with the function of this enzyme in normal tissues, where it mainly controls
the levels of MAGs, but not FFAs (Long et al., 2009b). These data thus provide a striking
example of the co-opting of an enzyme by cancer cells to serve a distinct metabolic purpose
that supports their pathogenic behavior.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We determined that MAGL is both necessary and sufficient to elevate FFAs and confer high
migratory and tumorigenic activity in cancer cells. Blockade of MAGL impaired not only in
vitro migration, but also in vivo tumor growth, and both phenotypes were rescued by
exogenous sources of FFAs. These data, in combination with the lack of effect of
cannnabinoid receptor antagonists on migration, indicate that the mechanism of MAGLstimulated cancer aggressiveness involves the action of FFA-derived products, rather than
reductions in MAGL substrates, such as the endocannabinoid 2-AG. Additional studies
argued against a major role for β-oxidation or glycolysis in mediating MAGL-dependent
aggressiveness. Instead, we found that MAGL regulates a host of secondary lipid
metabolites that include key signaling molecules, such as LPA and PGE2, known to support
cancer malignancy. Our finding that impairments in the MAGL–FFA pathway can be
rescued by exogenous fatty acids, including a high-fat diet in vivo, has provocative
implications for the crosstalk between obesity and tumorigenesis. It has been postulated that
excessive fat accumulation may exacerbate the development and progression of cancer
(Calle and Kaaks, 2004; Calle et al., 2003), and, conversely, reductions in caloric intake
have been shown to impede tumor growth (Kalaany and Sabatini, 2009). Our data suggest
one mechanism whereby a high-fat diet might promote malignancy, namely, by stimulating
the growth and migratory activity of cancer cells that do not themselves exhibit high rates of
lipolysis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Taken together, our results indicate that MAGL serves as key metabolic hub in aggressive
cancer cells, where the enzyme regulates a fatty acid network that feeds into a number of
pro-tumorigenic signaling pathways. Additional studies will be required to determine
precisely how FFAs are converted to pro-tumorigenic lipid transmitters, although some
obvious candidate pathways can be schematized (Figure 7I). It will be interesting to
determine whether any of the enzymatic components of these pathways are also
dysregulated in pathogenic cancers. One might also anticipate that cancer cells could exhibit
heightened levels of additional hydrolytic activities (e.g., di- and tri-acylglycerol hydrolysis)
to further capitalize on their lipogenic state, although we should note that the aggressive
cancer cells examined herein displayed much lower di- and tri-acylglycerol lipase activity
compared to MAGL activity, and these former activities did not differ between aggressive
and non-aggressive cancer cells (Figure S1). Finally, considering that endocannabinoids
(Wang et al., 2008), β-oxidation (Buzzai et al., 2005; Liu, 2006), and fatty acid-sustained
glycolysis (Przybytkowski et al., 2007) have each been described as potential contributing
elements to tumorigenesis, it is possible that these pathways may prove relevant for MAGLdependent aggressiveness in other types of cancer. Independent of which of these
mechanisms is operational in specific cancers, our data suggest that they would each
function downstream of MAGL, thus designating this enzyme as a potentially exciting
pharmacological target for future cancer therapy.

Experimental Procedures
Pharmacological Inhibition of MAGL in Cancer Cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Pharmacological inhibition studies were conducted as described previously (Chiang et al.,
2006). Cells were incubated in serum-free media with JZL184 (1 μM) or vehicle (DMSO)
for 4 h, after which the cells were harvested and analyzed. See Supplemental Experimental
Procedures for more detail.
ABPP and Hydrolytic Activity Assays of Cancer Cell Proteomes
Identification and comparative quantitiation of serine hydrolase activities from cancer cell
proteomes by ABPP-MudPIT or gel-based ABPP was conducted as previously described
using FP-biotin (5 μM) and FP-rhodamine (2 μM), respectively (Jessani et al., 2002; Jessani
et al., 2005). C20:4 MAG hydrolytic activity assays were performed as described previously
(Blankman et al., 2007). See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more detail.
RNA Interference Studies in Human Cancer Cell Lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RNA interference studies were conducted as described previously (Chiang et al., 2006). See
Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more detail. Short-hairpin RNA constructs were
subcloned into the pLP-RetroQ acceptor system, and retrovirus was generated by using the
AmphoPack-293 Cell Line (Clontech).
Overexpression Studies in Human Cancer Cell Lines
Stable MAGL overexpression was achieved by subcloning the MAGL gene into the
pMSCVpuro vector (Clontech), generating retrovirus using the AmphoPack-293 Cell Lines.
See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more detail.
Lipid Measurements in Cancer Cells
Lipid measurements were conducted similarly to protocols described previously (Chiang et
al., 2006). Briefly, cell metabolomes were extracted with 2:1:1 chloroform:methanol:Tris
buffer. The organic layer was extracted, followed by acidification of the acqueous phase and
reextraction with chloroform. The organic phases were combined, dried under N2 and
resuspended in chloroform for LC-MS analysis. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures
for more detail.
Cell Migration, Cell Survival, Invasion, and Tumor Xenograft Studies

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Migration, cell survival, invasion, and tumor xenograft studies of cancer cells were
performed as described in the Supplementary Methods. Migration assays were performed in
Transwell chambers (Corning) coated with 10 μg/ml collagen. Cell survival assays were
performed using the Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1 (Roche). Invasion assays were
conducted using the BD Matrigel Invasion Chambers. Human cancer xenografts were
established by transplanting cancer cell lines ectopically into the flank of C.B17 SCID mice.

MAGL is elevated in aggressive cancer cells, where the enzyme regulates monoacylgycerol
(MAG) and free fatty acid (FFA) levels. (A) ABPP of serine hydrolase activities in nonaggressive (blue) and aggressive (red) human cancer cell lines. Serine hydrolase activities
were labeled in whole cell proteomes with the activity-based probe FP-rhodamine and
detected by SDS-PAGE and in-gel fluorescence scanning (fluorescent gel shown in
grayscale). Highlighted in red boxes are two enzymes, MAGL and KIAA1363 that are
consistently elevated in aggressive versus nonaggressive cancer cells. Proteomes were also
prepared from cancer cells pretreated with DMSO or the selective MAGL inhibitor JZL184
(1 μM, 4 h) to confirm that the 33 and 35 kDa FP-rhodamine-labeled bands represented
MAGL. See Figure S1 for quantification of FP-rhodamine labeling signals for MAGL and
KIAA1363 across the panel of cancer lines and Tables S1-3 for a global analysis of FPbiotin-labeled serine hydrolase activities detected by ABPP in cancer cells. (B) C20:4 MAG

JZL184 (1 μM, 4 hr). (C, D) Inhibition of MAGL (JZL184 1 μM, 4h) raises MAG (C) and
lowers FFA (D) levels in aggressive, but not nonaggressive cells. Note that aggressive
cancer cells possess basally higher levels of FFAs (and lower levels of MAGs) compared to
non-aggressive cancer cells, reflecting their respective MAGL activities. * p < 0.05, ** p <

mutant (S122A), respectively. Western analysis confirmed the overexpression of the S122AMAGL mutant, which did not show any activity as judged by ABPP and C20:4 MAG
hydrolysis assays. (B, C) MAGL-OE cells contain lower MAG (B) and higher FFA (C)
levels compared to EV control and S122A cells. These metabolic effects were reversed by in
situ treatment with JZL184 (1 μM, 4 h, maroon bars). (D, E) MAGL-OE MUM2C cells
show increased migration (D) and invasion (E) compared to EV and S122A control cells.
This enhanced migration and invasion was reversed by JZL184 (1 μM, 4 h). Representative
migration panels are shown (D). (F) MAGL-OE MUM2C cells show a significantly
enhanced tumor growth rate compared to EV or S122A control cells in SCID mice
(orthotopically implanted with 2 × 106 cells). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 for MAGL-OE- versus
control groups. Data are presented as means ± SEM; n = 4–6/group.

Recovery of the pathogenic properties of shMAGL cancer cells by treatment with
exogenous fatty acids. (A) The reduced migration of shMAGL cells is reversed by treatment
with palmitic or stearic acid (20 μM, 4 h, hatched red bars). (B) Addition of palmitic or
stearic acid (20 μM, 4 h) increases the migration of MUM2C and OVCAR3 cells and
rescues the reduced migration in JZL184-treated MAGL-OE cells. (C) The reduced tumor
growth of shMAGL-C8161 cells is reversed by treatment with a high-fat diet (HFD) (60
kcal % fat). Mice were placed on normal chow (NC) or HFD two weeks prior to flank
injection of cancer cells and maintained on these diets throughout the tumor growth time
course. Inset, body weights for animals throughout time course. (D) Explanted shMAGL
tumors from the HFD-group (hatched red bars) contain elevated FFA levels compared to
shMAGL tumors from the NC-group (red bars). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 shMAGL versus
shControl groups. ## p < 0.01 for palmitic or stearic acid- or HFD-treated shMAGL groups
versus shMAGL control groups (DMSO- and NC-treated groups, respectively). Data are
presented as means ± SEM; For (A), n = 4–5/group; for (B, C), n = 7–8/group.

MAGL regulates a lipid network enriched in pro-tumorigenic signaling molecules. (A, B)
Lipidomic analyses of cancer cell models with altered MAGL activity comparing MAGLOE versus EV control (A) and shMAGL versus shControl (B) cells. The metabolites shown
are those that were increased (red) or decreased (blue) in MAGL-OE (both MUM2C and
OVCAR3) versus EV control cells (A) and showed the opposite profile in shMAGL (both
C8161 and SKOV3) versus shControl cells (B). Parent masses of metabolites are provided,
and the size of circles indicates the relative magnitude of change. Quantitation of lipid levels
are provided in Table S4. (C, D) Quantitation of C16:0 LPA and PGE2 levels in cancer cell
models. (E) Treatment of shMAGL cancer cells with C16:0 LPA (100 nM, 4 h) or PGE2
(100 nM, 4 h) rescues their defective migration compared to shControl cells. (F) Pertussis
toxin (PTX) (100 ng/ml, 4 h) reverses the increased migration of MAGL-OE cancer cells.
(G) Concentration-dependent stimulation of migration by LPA in EV control versus MAGLOE cells. Note that the maximal stimulation of migration induced by LPA In EV control
cells matches the basally enhanced migration observe din MAGL-OE cells, and LPA does
not further increase the migration of MAGL-OE cells. (H). Sensitivity of shControl versus
shMAGL cancer cells to the EGFR inhibitor tyrphostin AG-1478, expressed as percentage
of migration impairment. The absolute numbers of migrated cells and the effect of
tyrphostin on cell survival are shown in Figure S6. IC50 values for the anti-migratory effects
of tyrphostin are provided in the panels. (I) Scheme showing a possible metabolic network
connecting the MAGL-FFA pathway to other pro-tumorigenic lipids. For (A) and (B), data
are presented as mean relative changes between comparison groups; n = 4–5/group. For (C–
G), * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 for MAGL-OE or shMAGL versus respective control cell groups
(C–G), JZL184-treated versus DMSO-treated control cells (C, D). ##, p < 0.01 for parental
