Induction of Apoptosis by Celecoxib in
Cell Culture: An Uncertain Role
for Cyclooxygenase-2
To the Editor:
A recent report by Kern et al. (1) described molecular mechanisms of apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines
in response to treatment with the selective cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) inhibitor (coxib), celecoxib. In their study, the authors
treated Huh7 and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with
up to 100 Amol/L of celecoxib and found that this treatment led
to tumor cell death via the activation of death receptor signaling
and apoptosis originating from mitochondria; critical to these
processes was the down-regulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1
(Mcl-1) protein, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. The
authors concluded that the observed effects were mediated via
the inhibition of COX-2.
In my laboratory, we have done similar experiments with the
same and other cell lines that point to the opposite conclusion, i.e.,
that the effects of celecoxib are independent of any involvement
of COX-2.
It has been well established that in cell cultures, coxib
concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 Amol/L are generally sufficient to
rapidly and effectively block prostaglandin E2 production in
different types of cells, including tumor cells with varying levels
of overexpressed COX-2 ( for example, see ref. 2). Therefore, one
would expect that those drug effects that are dependent on COX-2
inhibition should be detectable at very low micromolar concentrations, and, furthermore, that they should be mimicked by other
COX-2 inhibitors, such as the coxib rofecoxib or some of the

traditional COX-1/COX-2 inhibitory nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In contrast, structural analogues of celecoxib that lack
the ability to inhibit COX-2 (3) should not be able to duplicate the
COX-2–dependent effects of celecoxib.
We treated Huh7 and HepG2 cell lines with celecoxib,
rofecoxib, indomethacin (a traditional COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor
with an IC50 towards COX-2 that is comparable to celecoxib), or
with 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib (DMC, a close structural analogue of
celecoxib that lacks COX-2–inhibitory activity; ref. 4). As shown
in Fig. 1A, celecoxib and DMC, but not rofecoxib or indomethacin, greatly reduced the viability of these cells; celecoxib and
DMC of <100 Amol/L killed the vast majority of the cell
population, whereas rofecoxib and indomethacin—even at 250
Amol/L—did not potently stimulate cell death. When the levels of
Mcl-1 protein in drug-treated cells were analyzed, it became
apparent that only celecoxib and DMC, but not rofecoxib or
indomethacin, were able to down-regulate this antiapoptotic
protein (Fig. 1B).
We repeated the above approach in a number of tumor cell lines
with varying levels of COX-2 expression and obtained essentially
the same results, i.e., that celecoxib and DMC, but not rofecoxib
and indomethacin, potently down-regulated Mcl-1 protein expression and caused growth arrest and apoptosis. For example, as shown
in Fig. 1, BxPC-3 and MIA-PaCA-2 pancreatic carcinoma cells
responded nearly identically to these drugs, even though COX-2
protein is absent in the former and was expressed at very high
levels in the latter (5).
Therefore, in consideration of the above-presented rationale for
using these four drugs in parallel, in combination with their
application to COX-2–positive and COX-2–negative cell lines, one
would conclude that the observed effects of celecoxib on cell death
and Mcl-1 are independent of COX-2—in agreement with

Figure 1. Huh7, BxPC-3, and
MIA-PaCa-2 cells were treated in
parallel with either celecoxib, rofecoxib,
indomethacin, DMC, or DMSO (vehicle
only). A, cells were exposed to various
concentrations of these drugs for 48 h,
and cell survival was determined with the
conventional MTT assay. B, cells were
treated with 100 Amol/L of each drug
for 4 h, and Mcl-1 protein levels were
examined by Western blot analysis (Huh7
cells, top ). With the use of a cell death
ELISA, it was further confirmed that
celecoxib and DMC, but not rofecoxib
and indomethacin, potently stimulated
apoptosis at 75 Amol/L (data not shown).
All these experiments were also done with
HepG2 cells, which yielded very similar
results (data not shown). Experiments
