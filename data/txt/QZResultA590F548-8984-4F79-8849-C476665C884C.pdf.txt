Abstract
Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a conserved serine/threonine
kinase that plays an essential role in regulating the many
processes involved in mitotic entry and progression. In
humans, Plk1 is expressed primarily during late G2 and M
phases and, in conjunction with Cdk1/cyclin B1, acts as
master regulatory kinases for the myriad protein substrates
involved in mitosis. Plk1 overexpression is strongly associated
with cancer and has been correlated with poor prognosis in a
broad range of human tumor types. We have identified a
potent, selective, reversible, ATP-competitive inhibitor of
Plk1, GSK461364A, capable of inhibiting cell growth of most
proliferating cancer cell lines tested. We observe distinct cell
cycle effects of GSK461364A depending on the dose used. The
predominant phenotype for cells treated with GSK461364A is
prometaphase arrest with characteristic collapsed polar polo
spindle. At high concentrations, GSK461364A delays mitotic
entry in G2 followed by gradual progression into terminal
mitosis; in some cell lines, this correlates with decreased
apoptosis. Cell culture growth inhibition by GSK461364A can
be cytostatic or cytotoxic but leads to tumor regression in
xenograft tumor models under proper dose scheduling.
Finally, we describe pharmacodynamic biomarkers of
GSK461364A activity (pHH3 and Plk1) that are currently being
evaluated in human cancer clinical trials. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Agents targeting microtubule dynamics, such as taxanes and
Vinca alkaloids, are widely used in the clinic against multiple types
of cancer. However, they carry substantial liabilities such as
significant and variable dose-limiting toxicities. The potential for
new selective drugs to target alternative mitotic mechanisms offers
the possibility not only to overcome certain limitations of current
tubulin-targeted antimitotic drugs but to expand the scope of
clinical efficacy that those drugs have established (1). The serine/
threonine Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) represents a compelling mitotic
target due to its multiple roles at key steps of mitosis and its
involvement in cancer progression. Plk1 plays a role in mitotic

entry (2–5), centrosome maturation and chromosome movement
(6–9), direct and indirect activation of the anaphase promoting
complex/cyclosome (10–13), formation of bipolar spindles, and accumulation of spindle assembly checkpoint proteins at the
kinetochores (14–18). Overexpression of Plk1 is transforming (19),
and several studies have shown correlations between Plk1 expression, histologic grade, and poor prognosis in various cancers (20).
Several Plk1 inhibitors (21–29) are currently under investigation
in clinical trials. Here we describe the identification and
characterization of the imidazotriazine GSK461364A, an inhibitor
of Plk1 kinase activity. GSK461364A is an ATP competitive, highly
selective Plk1 inhibitor producing mitotic arrest with the hallmark
polo spindle morphology in tumor cells. GSK461364A inhibits
cancer cell line proliferation from multiple origins with minimal
toxicity in nondividing human cells. Consistent with the multiple
known functions of Plk1 throughout mitosis, we observed dosedependent differences in the nature of cell cycle arrest and the
consequent cell fate. Finally we show that GSK461364A showed
clear antitumor activity in human tumor xenograft models, and
that the dose-dependent biological effects seen in vitro were
recapitulated in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Enzyme assays. Kinase reactions were performed in a final assay volume
of 10 AL using the Z¶-Lyte Assay kit (Ser/Thr peptide 16, Invitrogen). Briefly,
reactions contained 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.01% Brij 35, 0.01 mg/mL casein, 200 Amol/L ATP,
200 Amol/L Polo Box peptide (NH2-MAGPMQS[pT]PLNGAKK-OH, 21st
Century Biochemicals), and 6 nmol/L recombinant Plk1 (H6-tev-PLK 1-603,
GlaxoSmithKline). Plk1 was preincubated for 60 min in the presence or
absence of 0 to 1,000 nmol/L GSK461364A (GlaxoSmithKline). Reactions
were then initiated by the addition of 2 Amol/L peptide. After 15 min
at 23jC, reactions were quenched and processed according the Z¶-Lyte
protocol and read on an EnVision plate reader. Raw fluorescence values
were converted to concentration of product formed using substrate and
product standards. IC50 values were determined using a two-parameter fit
(Hill coefficient and IC50) using GraFit software (Erithacus). Because the
potency of inhibition for GSK461364A was observed to vary as a function of
the ATP concentration in a manner consistent with an ATP-competitive
mode of inhibition (data not shown), an upper limit for the K*app
for
i
GSK461364A was determined by applying the Cheng-Prusoff relationship
for a competitive inhibitor (ref. 30; ATP K m*app = 16 Amol/L) to the IC50
value obtained with 60 min preincubation of GSK461364A.
Plk scintillation proximity assays. Full-length Plk1 (Cell Signaling)
assays were performed as described (31) with minor changes. The enzyme
activity was measured in a reaction buffer containing 25 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.2), 15 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 Amol/L ATP, 0.2 ACi/well [g-33P]ATP
(10 Ci/mmol), 1 Amol/L substrate peptide (Biotin-Ahx-SFNDTLDFD: from
21st Century Peptides), 0.15 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 1 mmol/L DTT,

and 12.5 nmol/L full-length Plk1. Reactions were performed at room
temperature in total volume of 20 AL using white 96-well plates. After
120 min, 100 AL of stop mix [33 mmol/L EDTA, 3.0 mg/mL streptavidin
scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) PBS,
50 Amol/L ATP] were added to each well and left for 20 min. Aliquots
(100 AL) were then transferred to GF/C filter plates, and the beads were
washed four times with 100 AL PBS solution using vacuum filtration. Plates
were sealed and placed in a Packard TopCount (GMI, Inc.) running a
standard 33P SPA protocol reading each well for 60 s. Percentage inhibition
was then calculated relative to control reactions containing either no
inhibitor (signal max) or 50 mmol/L EDTA (background).
Kinase selectivity assays. To determine the kinase selectivity of
GSK461364A, the inhibition of 48 recombinant protein kinases was
characterized at GlaxoSmithKline according to standard biochemical
procedures. As much as possible, the assays were configured so that the
IC50 values approximate the intrinsic binding constant (K i or K d) of
GSK461364A to each enzyme and can therefore be compared for selectivity
against these kinases. However, the selectivity in cells may be different
because inhibitor potency will be affected to differing degrees based on the
ATP K m values for each kinase.
Cell culture, proliferation assay, and caspase activity assay. Cell lines
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown in the
recommended media at 37jC, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were
plated in triplicate 96-well microtiter plates at 1,000 cells per well in culture
media. GSK461364A dissolved in DMSO or negative control (0.1% DMSO)
were added the following day, and one plate was harvested with 50 AL of
CellTiter-Glo (Promega) for a time 0 (T = 0) measurement. Remaining
duplicate cell plates were typically incubated for 72 h. Cells were then lysed
with 50 AL CellTiter-Glo, and chemiluminescent signal was read on the
Wallac EnVision 2100 plate reader. All data were normalized to signal at
time of compound addition (T = 0). Curves were analyzed using the XLfit
(IDBS Ltd.) curve-fitting tool for Microsoft Excel to determine the gI50
(concentration of 50% growth inhibition relative to T = 0 and Y max values),
the gI-maximum (concentration giving maximum growth inhibition), and
the Y min (bottom of the four-parameter curve at gI-maximum). Based on
Y min value, we defined the maximum biological response for each cell line as
‘‘cytotoxic’’ (a Y min < 100% reflecting a net-cell decrease), ‘‘cytostatic’’ (Y min =
100–200%, wherein cells undergo one or fewer complete divisions), or
‘‘resistant’’ (Y min > 200%). For measure of caspase-3/caspase-7 activity, cells
were prepared and treated as above but were then harvested with 100 AL of
CaspaseGlo (Promega) and chemiluminescent signal read as above.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells treated with GSK461364A in cell culture
slides (NalgeNunc) were fixed first with 3.7% formaldehyde in Dulbecco’s
PBS (without Ca/Mg) and then with 20jC methanol with several PBS
washes in between. Cells were permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS.
Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating for 30 min at 37jC with 5%
normal donkey serum (Jackson) in PBS (blocking buffer). A primary
antibody mixture of mouse anti–g-tubulin (Abcam AB11316) and rabbit
anti–a-tubulin (Abcam AB15246) was added in blocking buffer and allowed
to bind overnight at 4jC. After several washes with blocking buffer, 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories) and secondary
antibodies rhodamine red-donkey anti-mouse IgG and CY2-donkey antirabbit IgG (Jackson) were added in blocking buffer for 30 min at room
temperature. After additional washes, coverslips were mounted with antifade medium (Invitrogen). Microscopy was performed using an Olympus
IX71 fluorescent microscope under the 60 oil objective. Images were
captured and analyzed with Image-Pro Plus 5.1 software.
Phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser10; pHH3) ELISA. Briefly, 96-well
ELISA plates (Corning) were coated with 2.5 Ag/mL anti-Pan histone
(Millipore) capture antibody in PBS (with Ca/Mg) overnight at 4jC. Plates
were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) for 1 h at room
temperature and then washed repeatedly with PBS containing 0.05% Tween
20 (PBST). Cells treated with GSK461364A in 96-well microtiter plates
(Nunc) were lysed at room temperature for 30 min with CelLytic-M Cell
Lysis Reagent (Sigma) containing 100 nmol/L calyculin A, 1 mmol/L sodium
fluoride, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 20 Ag/mL DNase I (Roche), and
1 EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche). Lysates were transferred

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

to the ELISA plates and allowed to bind for 1 h at room temperature. Plates
were washed, and the anti-pHH3 (Ser10; Abcam) detection antibody was
applied at 1:1,000 in 1% nonfat dry milk/PBST. After 2 h of room
temperature incubation and wash, the secondary antibody was applied
(1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed again, and
BM POD (Roche Applied Science) chemiluminescent substrate was added.
Luminescent signal was detected on the Wallac EnVision 2100 plate reader
(Perkin-Elmer).
Immunohistochemistry. Tissue from Colo205 tumor xenograft model
was harvested at 24 and 48 h postdose with GSK4613464A or vehicle. Tumor
tissue cut to f100 mm3 samples was fixed in 10% formalin (neutralbuffered, VWR; VW3239-7) for 24 h and then transferred to 70% ethanol
before paraffin embedding. Paraffin-embedded blocks were sectioned to
6 Am. Sections were rehydrated, and an antigen retrieval step was
incorporated to improve detection of pHH3 (3-min microwave of slides
immersed in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer, pH 6.0). Antibodies were pHH3 (Ser10;
Upstate Biotech, 06-570), Plk1 (Calbiochem, 35-206), and Ki-67 (DAKO,
MIB-1), and DNA was counterstained with hematoxylin. Sectioned slides
were shipped to Mosaic Laboratories for staining, imaging, and quantitation.
DNA content analysis. Cells were treated with serial dilutions of
GSK461364A for 24 h, fixed in chilled 70% ethanol for 2 h, washed with PBS,
and stained with a propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) solution containing
20 Ag/mL propidium iodide, 0.2 mg/mL Rnase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in
PBS. Data were acquired on a FACSCalibur and analyzed with the FlowJo
software package (Tree Star, Inc.).
Cyclin B1-GFP U2OS cell line. The stable cyclin B1-GFP expressing
U2OS cell line was obtained from GE Healthcare Life Sciences. The cell line
encodes a fused cyclin B1-GFP protein under the cyclin B1 promoter, which
defines the phase of individual cells in the cell cycle based on cell cycle–
dependent expression, destruction, and localization of cyclin B1-GFP fusion
protein. Cells were treated with serial dilutions of GSK461364A for 24 to
72 h, counterstained with the DNA dye Draq5, and imaged and analyzed
with the In Cell Analyzer 3000 (GE).
Tumor xenograft studies. Cells were implanted in Nude mice and
grown as tumor xenografts. Dosing began when tumors achieved
f100 mm3. GSK461364A or the vehicle [4% DMA/Cremaphore (50:50),
pH 5.6] was given i.p. to mice every 2 d (q2dx6, q2dx12) or every 4 d (q4dx3)
at nominal dose levels of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/dose. Results are reported
as median tumor volume for n = 7 to 8 mice. Paclitaxel (Mead Johnson;
30 mg/kg i.v.; q4dx3) was used as a positive control for comparison. Tumors
were measured thrice a week with Vernier calipers, and tumor volume was
calculated from two-dimensional measurements using an equation
approximating the volume of a prolate ellipsoid [tumor volume mm3 =
(length  width2)  0.5]. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as the
highest dose that produced >20% mortality or >20% weight loss (f4 g).
Antitumor activity was defined as tumor growth delay (TGD), partial
regression (PR), or complete regression (CR). TGD represents the time
differential between the treated and control tumors to reach a predetermined tumor volume of 1,000 mm3. PR was defined as a decrease in an
individual tumor volume to one-half the initial starting volume for at least
1 wk (three consecutive measurements). CR was defined as a decrease in an
individual tumor volume to <13 mm3 for at least 1 wk.

Results
Identification and biochemical characterization of
GSK461364A. GSK461364A was identified after a library screening
campaign using a Plk1 scintillation proximity assay, accompanied
by lead optimization of the identified chemical entity (structure/
activity relationship), leading to the identification of GSK461364A
(32). When evaluated against full-length Plk1 in an in vitro
biochemical assay, inclusion of a 60-minute preincubation step
significantly increased the compound potency (Supplementary
Fig. S1), suggesting a time-dependent mechanism of inhibition with
an apparent dissociation constant (K*app
) value of <0.5 F 0.1 nmol/L

(Supplementary Table S1). Upon rapid dilution of a preformed

Concentration-Dependent Effects of GSK461364A

enzyme-inhibitor complex into a substrate mix with saturating
ATP, a qualitatively slow recovery of activity was observed (data
not shown), indicating that the dissociation of the compound was
reversible although not instantaneous and confirming the observed
time-dependent inhibition. These data also confirm that the true
potency for Plk1 could be substantially lower than the K*app
i
determined above.
When evaluated against Plk2 and Plk3 (Supplementary Table S1),
GSK461364A was significantly less potent (K*app
: 860 and 1,000
i
nmol/L, respectively). To further explore selectivity, GSK461364A
was tested against an in-house panel of 48 kinases. GSK461364A
had at least 1,000-fold selectivity for Plk1 over the majority of
kinases tested (Supplementary Fig. S2). GSK461364A was further
screened against a commercial panel of recombinant kinases
(KinaseProfiler, Millipore). In this screen, 37 of 262 kinases
showed >50% inhibition with only six kinases inhibited by >90%
at 10 Amol/L (>5,000-fold of the IC50 for Plk1; Supplementary
Table S2). Taken together, these data show that GSK461364A is a
potent, selective, reversible, ATP-competitive inhibitor of Plk1 with
a prolonged rate of dissociation from the enzyme.
GSK461364A causes prometaphase arrest in vitro. To study
the consequence of GSK461364A exposure on cell cycle, a NSCLC
line A549 was treated with serial dilutions of GSK461364A for
20 hours and propidium iodide stained, and DNA content was
analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A). Concentrations at above
10 nmol/L GSK461364A caused increased 4N DNA content
indicating G2-M arrest. With extended exposure duration,
increased sub-2N DNA indicating increased cell death is observed
for GSK461364A concentrations of >10 nmol/L (data not shown).

The mitotic phenotype caused by this Plk1 inhibitor was
confirmed by cell staining. A549 cells treated for 16 hours with
GSK461364A were fixed and immunostained for a-tubulin, gtubulin, and DAPI. At 20 nmol/L GSK461364A (approximately gI50),
a significant increase in mitotic cells is evident. At this relatively
low active concentration, mitotic cells exhibit a mixture of aberrant
bipolar and monopolar spindles (Fig. 1B). Where cells exhibit
bipolar centrosomal separation, chromatin is incompletely aligned
at the metaphase plate. For these cells, g-tubulin staining at the
centrosomes is evident but relatively reduced. At higher concentration GSK461364A (313 nmol/L; approximately gI-maximum),
we observed primarily monopolar/apolar spindles with no evident
g-tubulin staining at centrosomes. Notably, chromatin is not
organized in a rosette around the monopolar spindle (characteristic of the KSP\Eg5 inhibitor monastrol), suggesting a lack of
syntelic microtubule-kinetochore attachments; instead, the chromatin is highly condensed and disorganized around the aberrant
mitotic spindle. In addition, DAPI staining shows significant
micronucleation in those cells that survived mitotic arrest and
underwent aberrant mitotic exit with tetraploidy, termed mitotic
slippage (Fig. 1C). With prolonged drug treatment, micronucleation
is observed in virtually all surviving cells.
GSK461364A broadly inhibits cancer cell proliferation with
differential survival outcome. In a proliferation assay,
GSK461364A causes cell growth inhibition in a majority of the
74 tested cancer cell lines. In this assay, a measurement was
performed at the time of compound addition (T = 0) and after
72 hours drug incubation. Results (Fig. 2) show that 89% of cell
lines (66 of 74 lines) responded to GSK461364A with a gI50

Figure 1. Plk1 inhibitor GSK461364A causes aberrant mitotic arrest and micronucleation. A, A549 lung carcinoma lines were treated for 20 h with serial dilutions
of GSK461364A, and DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry propidium iodine staining. GSK461364A at concentrations of >20 nmol/L blocks cells in G2-M
phase with reduction of cells in G1 phase. Maximum G2-M arrest is observed at concentrations of z39 nmol/L. B, A549 cells were treated for 16 h with different
concentrations of GSK461364A and analyzed by immunofluorescence for a-tubulin (green ), g-tubulin (red), and chromatin (DAPI; blue ). GSK461364A causes mitotic
arrest at concentrations of 20 nmol/L with mitotic spindle aberrations at higher concentrations of 313 nmol/L. These aberrations were principally in the form of
spindle monopolarity and chromatin disorganization. C, micronucleation is evident at z20 nmol/L GSK461364A by DAPI staining.

(concentration required to inhibit 50% cell growth) of V100 nmol/L.
Notably, although the rate of cell doublings did not generally show
strong correlation with gI50 values, cell lines that exhibited almost
no cell growth during the 72-hour assay did show correspondingly
little effect from GSK461364A exposure (data not shown). A
comparison of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells cultured
in subconfluent or confluent nondividing conditions confirms that
cell division is necessary for the activity of GSK461364A
(Supplementary Fig. S3), in that there is no apparent toxicity on
human normal nonproliferating cells.
A comparison of the maximum drug effect (Y min of the fourparameter growth inhibition curve) normalized to T = 0 value
allows a useful determination of the relative cytotoxic or cytostatic
outcome GSK461364A caused for a given cell line. Broadly, we
considered a Y min of <100% to reflect a net cell decrease indicating
population cytotoxicity; similarly we defined cytostasis as Y min =
100% to 200%, wherein cells undergo one or fewer complete
divisions. Data show (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S3) that at
maximum effective drug concentrations 42% of cell lines treated
with GSK461364A had net cytotoxicity, 45% had net cytostatic
response, and 13% showed cell growth greater than 1 doubling

(Y min > 200%). These results show that GSK461364A potently
inhibits cell proliferation of multiple cancer cell lines, but that
survival outcomes can vary depending on the individual cell line
tested. Whereas this method of binning cell response in cultured
cells clearly indicates differences in outcome, its utility for
predicting in vivo efficacy is limited: essentially all tumor xenograft
models tested showed degrees of tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 5D),
but the degrees did not correlate strongly with the in vitro binning.
However, it is worth noting that among the xenograft tumor lines,
those with the most cytotoxic response in cell culture (least Y min),
MDA-MB-231 and Colo205, also had the largest TGD, and
conversely the most resistant cells (greatest Y min), MX-1, had the
smallest TGD.
GSK461364A blocks cells in G2 and M phases of the cell cycle
and causes M-phase caspase-3/caspase-7 activation. Whereas
GSK461364A results in a normal sigmoidal dose-response curve on
many cancer cell lines (40%), many other cell lines (60%), such as
the human breast cancer ZR-75-1 cells, respond to Plk1 inhibitor
GSK461364A in a biphasic manner (Fig. 3A). Cell lines with a
biphasic response pattern exhibit maximum growth inhibition at
‘‘low-active’’ drug concentrations between 10 and 250 nmol/L but

Figure 2. Activity of Plk1 inhibitor on cancer cell lines from different tissue of origin. A, GSK461364A activity was tested against 74 cancer cell lines from different
tissues of origin using a 72-h growth assay. Sensitivity to Plk1 inhibitor was segregated by gI50 (greater or less than 100 nmol/L) and by the maximum net cell change
(defined by the Y min of a four-parameter-fit curve) relative to the T = 0 starting population: cytotoxic (Y min < 100%, T = 0), cytostatic (Y min = 100–200%, T = 0), or
resistant (Y min > 200%, T = 0). B, examples of the alternative net responses are shown for MDA-MB-231, A549, and PC3 cell lines; T = 0 and Y max values are indicated
with dotted and solid gray lines, respectively.

Concentration-Dependent Effects of GSK461364A

Figure 3. Concentration and time-dependent growth
inhibition and caspase-3/caspase-7 activation by
GSK461364A. ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines were
treated with GSK461364A at different concentrations
and quantitated for cell number (CellTiter-Glo, A) and
caspase-3/caspase-7 activation (CaspaseGlo, B ) at
different time points. At low-active (10–250 nmol/L)
and high-active (>250 nmol/L) concentrations of Plk1
inhibitor, different biological outcomes are evident.
On day 3, caspase activation and growth inhibition
are maximally observed at 10 to 250 nmol/L
GSK461364A; >250 nmol/L GSK461364A results
in reduced apoptosis and a residual viable but
nondividing cell population. Prolonged drug treatment
of 5 to 7 d results in some increased caspase
activation at the high-active drug concentrations.

seem to have a residual viable cell population at ‘‘high-active’’
concentrations of >250 nmol/L. Furthermore, caspase-3/caspase-7
is maximally activated at a low-active concentration of GSK461364A
corresponding to maximal growth inhibition (Fig. 3B). Notably,
the viable cells at high-active concentrations do not seem to grow
beyond one cell division (200% of T = 0) assaying out to 7 days.
These data suggest GSK461364A dose-dependent differences in
outcome due to extent of Plk1 inhibition, with maximum apoptosis
resulting from low-active drug concentrations.
To further investigate this concentration-dependent outcome to
Plk1 inhibition, we used an engineered U2OS (osteosarcoma) cell
line expressing a fused cyclin B1-GFP protein under the cyclin B1
promoter in which the G2 and M phases can be differentiated using
an image-based analysis. After 24 h of exposure to GSK461364A,
cells were blocked primarily in mitosis and, to a lesser extent, in
G2 at low-active concentrations of GSK461364A (10–250 nmol/L;
Fig. 4A). However, at increasing GSK461364A concentration
(>250 nmol/L) the percentage of G2 cells exceeds the percentage
of mitotic cells. Notably by 48 hours, the majority of cells at the
high-active concentrations are mitotic (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the
G2 delay is transient, preceding mitotic progression and arrest.

www.aacrjournals.org

To confirm that this concentration-dependent cell cycle arrest
was not unique to U2OS cells, analysis was performed on
additional cell lines detecting levels of phosphorylated histone
H3 (Ser10; pHH3) as a biomarker for mitosis. U2OS, A549, HT29
(colon cancer), and MDA-MB-468 (breast cancer) cell lines were
treated for 19 hours with serial dilutions of GSK461364A and pHH3
levels measured by ELISA. In each cell line, the level of pHH3
peaked at low-active concentrations GSK461364A (10–250 nmol/L)
and then decreased slightly at higher concentrations (Fig. 4C).
These results support the conclusion that the predominant effect of
GSK461364A is mitotic arrest but that at sufficiently high
concentrations GSK461364A may delay entry into mitosis. This
G2 delay seems to be transient and in the short-term may be
protective from apoptosis.
GSK461364A is efficacious in xenograft tumor models.
GSK461364A was dosed i.p. in mice bearing Colo205 (colorectal)
xenograft tumors, and several dosing schedules were tested (Fig. 5).
Higher intermittent dosing with a q4dx3 (one dose every 4 days
repeated thrice) schedule at 100 mg/kg (Fig. 5A) resulted in 18 days
TGD and one PR out of five mice treated. More frequent lower
dosing with 50 mg/kg q2dx6 schedule (Fig. 5B) resulted in longer

TGD (39 days) and 2PR. Extending the schedule of 50 mg/kg q2dx12
resulted in longer TGD (62 days) with one CR and 3PR observed
(Fig. 5C), efficacy approaching the antitumor activity of the positive
control agent paclitaxel. On the q2d treatment schedules, 100 mg/kg

were not tolerated after the third drug treatment (with >15% body
weight loss and mortality of two of five mice). For all schedules of
GSK461364A, tumors decreased in mass during the treatment
period, but tumor growth resumed upon cessation of treatment.
The optimal dosing schedule of 50 mg/kg q2dx12 showed various
degrees of TGD in multiple xenograft tumor models tested (Fig. 5D).
To confirm that the efficacy observed in xenograft tumor models
was due to Plk1 inhibition, tumors from animals treated with
GSK461364A were harvested at 24 and 48 hours posttreatment and
evaluated immunohistochemically for pharmacodynamic biomarkers of mitotic arrest pHH3 (phosphorylated during M phase)
and Plk1 (expressed primarily during late G2 and M phases) and
counterstained for proliferative biomarker Ki67. Ki67 was unchanged after a short-term Plk1 inhibitor treatment (Fig. 6A). As
expected, GSK461364A at 50 and 100 mg/kg resulted in significant
increases in cells positive for the mitotic analytes pHH3 and Plk1.
At the efficacious dose of 50 mg/kg, the levels of pHH3 and Plk1
significantly increased 24 hours posttreatment and decreased to
untreated vehicle control levels by 48 hours posttreatment,
confirming that the inhibitory effects of GSK461364A are reversible
by 2 days posttreatment. Notably, at the 100 mg/kg dose (not
tolerated on long term), the levels of pHH3 and Plk1 increased
at 24 hours posttreatment but to a lesser extent than with the lower
dose of 50 mg/kg treatment; however, at 48 hours postdose
with 100 mg/kg, levels of pHH3 and Plk1 increased further.
This delay in pHH3 increase observed for the 100 mg/kg dose was
also confirmed by immunoblotting tumor lysates for pHH3
(Supplementary Fig. S4). These data suggest, as we observed in
cell culture, a transient G2-phase delay preceding mitotic arrest at a
high-active dose of GSK461364A.
In addition to the dose-dependent increase in the percentage of
positive cells for the mitotic analytes pHH3 and Plk1, hematoxylin
staining reveals dose-dependent differences in the mitotic chromatin. Chromosome alignment at the metaphase equatorial plate is
clear in mitotic cells of tumors from mice treated with vehicle,
indicating a bipoloar spindle (Fig. 6B). Similar metaphase-aligned
chromatin is evident in tissue dosed up to 50 mg/kg. However at 50
to 100 mg/kg, the predominant phenotype transitions to disorganized condensed chromatin staining consistent with ‘‘polo’’ spindles.
These data confirm that GSK461364A is efficacious in vivo and may
suggest that the optimal dosing schedule in vivo produces biological
effects consistent with the low-active concentrations of
GSK461364A in vitro wherein peak apoptosis was observed.

Discussion

Figure 4. Plk1 inhibitor GSK461364A causes mitotic arrest at low concentrations
and G2 delay at high concentrations. An engineered U2OS cell line encoding a
fused cyclin B1-GFP protein under the cyclin B1 promoter was used to define
the phase of individual cells in the cell cycle based on cell cycle–dependent
expression, destruction, and localization of cyclin B1-GFP fusion protein after
treatment with Plk1 inhibitor GSK461364A. A, after a 24-h treatment, cells are
blocked in mitosis at low concentration of Plk1 inhibitor (10–100 nmol/L) and in G2
at >250 nmol/L. B, after a 48-h treatment, a concentration of >500 nmol/L cells
progressed from G2 block to M phase of cell cycle. C, various cancer cell lines
were treated for 19 h with Plk1 inhibitor at different concentrations and harvested,
and phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser10, pHH3) levels measured by ELISA.
Maximum level of pHH3 is generally observed at mid-dose of GSK461364A
(10–100 nmol/L), indicating M-phase arrest. At higher concentrations, pHH3
levels are relatively lower, suggesting elevated G2 phase arrest.

We have detailed here the activity of GSK461364A, a highly
specific, ATP competitive Plk1 inhibitor. Our data confirms the
essential cellular function of Plk1, as the majority of proliferating
cell lines tested are growth-inhibited by GSK461364A with a gI50 of
V100 nmol/L. Consistent with the mechanism of action, cell lines
with inherently or induced slow doubling rates were relatively
insensitive to GSK461364A; furthermore, xenograft tumor models
indicated that GSK461364A is most efficacious with a sustained
schedule of frequent low doses. These data suggest that sustained
clinical exposure may be optimal for effective antiproliferative
activity of GSK461364A.
Inhibition of Plk1 has been extensively explored using a number of
molecular techniques including antibody microinjection (6), antisense (33), expression of a dominant negative (34), RNA interference
(35), and most recently using small molecule inhibitors of this

Concentration-Dependent Effects of GSK461364A

Figure 5. GSK461364A activity in xenograft tumor models favors frequent lower dosing. TGD in Colo205 tumor model was determined for GSK461364A (i.p.
administration) for q4dx3 (A) or q2dx6 (B ) schedule. Extending the duration of the dosing to q2dx12 (C ) resulted in improved antitumor activity with increased complete
and PRs observed. D, GSK461364A was given i.p. at 25 or 50 mg/kg using a q2dx12 schedule. The maximum antitumor response is reported.

enzyme (28, 29, 31). Over time our knowledge of the number of
mitotic events regulated by Plk1 and the number of Plk1 substrates
has ballooned. Phosphoproteomic analysis of purified mitotic
spindles alone identified 62 phosphorylation sites with the Plk1
conserved phosphorylated motif (8.4% of mapped phosphorylated
sites; ref. 36). Because that study likely captured only a window of
mitotic progression and only a fraction of the cell (the Taxolstabilized mitotic spindle and associated structures), it likely
underestimates the true number of mitotic phosphorylated proteins.
The true number of substrates regulated by Plk1 may be far higher.
Consistent with the myriad regulatory activities attributed to
Plk1 during mitosis, the biological effects of Plk1 inhibitor
GSK461364A are highly dose, time, and cell line dependent. At
low-active concentrations of GSK461364A (near gI50) mitotic
spindles accumulate with mixed bipolar and monopolar phenotypes; at higher concentrations (around gI-maximum), the
predominant phenotype is mitotic arrest with characteristic ‘‘polo’’
monopolar (or collapsed bipolar) spindles. In these cells, microtubules radiate from unseparated centrosomes that lack g-tubulin
accumulation, and chromatin is highly condensed, ball-shaped, and
disorganized around the mitotic spindle. At increasingly high
concentrations (>250 nmol/L), GSK461364A induces G2 delay in
mitotic entry in some cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

Assays measuring proliferation and apoptosis suggest that high
concentrations of GSK461364A were relatively less cytotoxic
compared with lower active concentrations. One hypothesis for
this differential effect is that cells delayed initially in G2 at high
inhibitor concentration may trigger a stress response resulting in
expression of proteins which later permit a better mitotic injury
survival response. It has been shown, for example, that antiapoptotic proteins like Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 can significantly influence
survival during mitotic arrest (37, 38); expression of these or other
survival proteins in G2-delayed cells may better prepare cells to
survive when they eventually enter and arrest in mitosis. Another
hypothesis is that the eventual mitotic arrests observed for cells
treated at higher or lower active Plk1 inhibitor concentrations
differ in their injury and survivability. In this hypothesis, the
transient G2 arrest at high concentrations does not influence
differential survival. Instead, when the cells eventually enter and
arrest in mitosis, complete Plk1 inhibition at higher active
concentration may produce a more complete early mitotic arrest,
whereas partial Plk1 inhibition at lower active concentration may
result in more damaging abortive attempts to progress in mitosis.
We observed similar dose-dependence in vivo, with differences in
the cell cycle phenotype in tumor xenograft models. It remains
unclear whether the protective effect observed in vitro has

Figure 6. Immunohistochemical staining of GSK461364A-treated tumor xenografts. A, quantitation of immunohistochemistry shows an increase of mitotic analytes
Plk1 and pHH3 at 50 mg/kg at day 1 postdosing and decrease by day 2. Notably, day 1 Plk1 and pHH3 are slightly lower at 100 mg/kg dose, but increase by day 2. Ki67
levels were unchanged. B, images of tumor sections from Colo205 xenografts harvested 24 h after treatment with vehicle, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg GSK461364A.
Immunohistochemical staining for pHH3 (brown) and hematoxylin (blue ) shows a dose-dependent increase in mitotic cell accumulation. Chromosome alignment at the

significant effect on the ultimate outcome for the population of
treated cells, but it is notable that in a Colo205 xenograft model
more frequent dosing was more effective than higher intermittent
dosing ( for equal total doses), consistent with maximum tumor cell
apoptosis occurring at intermediate active concentrations.
The complexity of investigating the effect of a Plk1 inhibitor is
further complicated by the observed differences in outcome for
different cell lines. Whereas 89% of the cell lines we tested showed
growth inhibition with gI50 V 100 nmol/L, there were substantial
differences across cell lines as to whether the effect was primarily
cytotoxic (42%) or only cytostatic (45%). These findings agree with
a recent examination of interline and intraline responses to other
mitotic inhibitors including the tubulin toxins nocodazole and
Taxol, and the Eg5 inhibitors monastrol and AZ138 clearly
confirmed differential outcome both across cell lines and among
individual cells (37). The factors affecting the differential outcome
involve multiple checkpoint and apoptotic pathways. Efficacy of
multiple mitotic inhibitors is generally compromised by deficiencies in the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (38–40). For cells
that survive mitotic arrest, mitotic slippage has been shown to
result in a p53/p21–dependent tetraploid G1 arrest (termed the
postmitotic checkpoint) that can affect the number of rounds of
mitotic injury that cells undergo (41–43). Finally, levels of

mitochondrial factors of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway including
prosurvival Bcl-XL and proapoptotic Bax can significantly shift the
outcome of mitotic inhibitors, tipping mitotic arrest toward
apoptosis or survival (44–46). These suggest the likely complexity
of predicting responsive tumor populations, but also indicate the
potential for combining a Plk1 inhibitor with apoptotic potentiators currently in clinical development.
GSK461364A is broadly antiproliferative for tumor cell lines
in vitro and efficacious in multiple in vivo tumor models. Use of
clinical pharmacodynamic biomarkers may enable dosing patients
at effective drug concentrations, potentially reducing unwanted
toxicity and maximizing the antitumor activity. Finally, the use of
predictive clinical biomarkers to selectively target a responsive
patient population remains a highly desirable goal under ongoing
investigation.
