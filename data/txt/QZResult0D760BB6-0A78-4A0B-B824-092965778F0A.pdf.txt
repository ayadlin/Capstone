Abstract
Malignant transformation in melanoma is characterized by
a phenotype ‘‘switch’’ from E- to N-cadherin, which is
associated with increased motility and invasiveness of the
tumor and altered signaling, leading to decreased apoptosis.
We hypothesized that the novel pentapeptide (ADH-1), which
disrupts N-cadherin adhesion, could sensitize melanoma
tumors to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. N-cadherin–
expressing human melanoma-derived cell lines were used to
generate xenografts in animal models to study isolated limb
infusion with melphalan and systemic chemotherapy with
temozolomide. We report here that melphalan in combination
with ADH-1 significantly reduced tumor growth up to 30-fold
over melphalan alone. ADH-1 enhancement of response to
melphalan was associated with increased formation of DNA
adducts, increased apoptosis, and intracellular signaling
changes associated with focal adhesions and fibroblast growth
factor receptors. Targeted therapy using an N-cadherin
antagonist can dramatically augment the antitumor effects of
chemotherapy and is a novel approach to optimizing treatment for melanoma. [Cancer Res 2008;68(10):3777–84]

Introduction
The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing at a rate
faster than any other cancer with an expected 60,000 new cases
diagnosed this year in the United States (1). Melanoma that has
spread to distant sites is rarely curable—treatment options are
limited and response rates are poor and short-lived (2, 3). There
have been few changes to treatment strategies for these patients in
nearly 40 years and expanding therapeutic options will be essential
for improving outcomes.
Melanoma is characterized by a switch in expression of the
cadherin family of cell adhesion molecules from a largely
E-cadherin–expressing phenotype to a predominantly N-cadherin–
expressing one (4, 5) as it progresses from a preinvasive to a
metastatic form. In normal melanocytes, E-cadherin expression
provides for high-affinity anchoring to neighboring keratinocytes
and serves as a tumor suppression mechanism (4). With malignant
transformation, generally at the vertical growth phase transition,
N-cadherin is up-regulated as a dominant phenotype. Transformed

melanocytes acquire invasive migratory capabilities, an ability to
transit the endothelial vascular barrier and undergo epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (6–8). Src tyrosine kinase has been
shown to be activated during transendothelial migration of melanoma cells, and other intracellular signaling pathways may also be
altered by this switch with downstream consequences such as
increased proliferation, survival and angiogenesis, and decreased
apoptosis (9).
ADH-1 is a novel cyclic pentapeptide that contains the cell
adhesion recognition site (His-Ala-Val) important in N-cadherin
adhesion. Previous reports showed that peptides containing this
sequence disrupt cell adhesion, induce apoptosis, and alter the
intracellular distribution of h-catenin and actin in endothelial cells
(10). The antitumor effects of N-cadherin disruption with ADH-1
are thought to occur by two mechanisms—altering intracellular
signaling pathways coupled to the cadherin adhesion complexes
and disrupting heterotypic cell-cell contacts between the tumor
cells and surrounding endothelial cells. Although ADH-1 has been
well-tolerated in phase I clinical trials, its antitumor efficacy as a
single agent has been modest (11, 12). However, given its wide
distribution in the majority of metastatic melanoma lesions, the
signaling pathways connected to it and the role of N-cadherin
adhesion in tumor survival mechanisms, N-cadherin satisfies
several of the criteria that would make it an ideal candidate for
targeting as a means to sensitize tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects
of concurrently administered chemotherapy.
Using a panel of melanoma xenografts, we have studied the
effects of ADH-1 on tumor response rates to two chemotherapy
reagents. We report here that response to therapy with either
regionally administered melphalan or systemically administered
temozolomide is enhanced when used in combination with
systemic ADH-1. ADH-1 when used in combination with chemotherapy lead to increased apoptosis and DNA adduct formation
as well as changes in intracellular signaling associated with
focal adhesions, the Abl kinase, and the fibroblast growth factor
(FGF) receptor.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines and xenograft studies. Tumor cell lines derived from
human malignant melanomas (DM lines) were courtesy of Dr. H. Seigler
(Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). All other cell lines were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured
in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum,
2 mmol/L glutamine, 1,000 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin
and grown at 37jC and 5% CO2.
Female nude rats (6-wk-old; Charles River Laboratories International,
Inc.) were injected s.c. in the right hind limb with 5  106 cells. Tumor
volume was calculated as: [(length)  (width)2]/2. Treatment began when
tumor volume was 100 mm3. The rat protocol was approved by the Duke

University and Durham VA Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committees.
For systemic studies, female nude mice (HRLN nu/nu) were injected s.c.
in the right flank with 1  107 cells DM366. A375 was maintained in athymic
nude mice by serial engraftment; a tumor fragment (1 mm3) was implanted
s.c. into the right flank. On day 1 of the study (tumor volume, f150 mm3),
mice were assigned to treatment groups. All mouse studies were performed
following an approved animal protocol at Piedmont Research Center.
Temozolomide (Temodar; Schering Corp.) and melphalan (GlaxoWellcome, Inc.) were purchased. A 10 mg/mL temozolomide stock solution
was prepared fresh; 10 mL/kg body weight was given via i.p. injection
( final dose, 100 mg/kg). A 22.5 mL isolated limb infusion (ILI) infusate of
0.9% sodium chloride solution containing 90 mg/kg melphalan was
prepared fresh. ADH-1, kindly provided by Adherex Technologies, Inc.,
was prepared in PBS, and 10 mL/kg body weight was given via i.p. injection
( final dose, 100 mg/kg).
ILI was performed as described previously (13–15). The femoral artery
and vein were cannulated. The arterial catheter was attached to a peristaltic
pump while venous drainage flowed by gravity into a reservoir. A tourniquet
was placed around the thigh. A 15-minute melphalan infusion (1.5 mL/min)
was followed by a 1 min saline wash-out (3.0 mL/min).
Response to drug treatment was followed until tumor volume reached
5,000 mm3 or 60 d for regional studies, or tumor volume reached 2,000 mm3
for systemic studies. Response was evaluated by the percent increase in
tumor volume, tumor quintupling time, maximal decrease in tumor volume,
number of tumor regressions, and response to treatment for 6 (regional
melphalan) or 10 (systemic temozolomide) animals per group.
Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and expression analysis. For
protein analysis, tumor was lysed in a modified radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting.
Antibodies used were as follows: Akt, pAKt (Ser473), phosphorylated Paxillin

(pPaxillin; Tyr188), pCrkL (Tyr207), CrkL, and E-Cadherin (Cell Signaling
Technology); FGFR-1 (Flg) and cSrc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.);
N-Cadherin and Paxillin (Zymed Laboratories); Abl and Akt (BD
Biosciences); and actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was
performed as previously described (16, 17). Treated and nontreated
melanoma was used as positive and negative control for the MP5/73
antibody (kindly provided by Dr. M.J. Tilby, Northern Institute for Cancer
Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom; refs.
18–20). Tissue sections stained for Klenow Frag-EL (Oncogene) were stained
according to the manufacture’s instructions. RNA was isolated using the
Qiagen RNeasy mini kit.
Statistical analysis. The tumor response to chemotherapy was assessed
by ANOVA. Student’s t test was performed for tumor regressions. P values of
<0.05 were considered significant. Correlation coefficients were obtained
using a regression analysis.
See Supplementary Data for additional details.

Results
Expression of N- and E-cadherin. Expression of N- and
E-cadherin was evaluated across a panel of melanoma cell lines to
identify the degree to which these melanomas have undergone a
‘‘switch’’ in cadherin expression (Fig. 1A). Gene expression data
were confirmed at the level of protein expression across a subset of
these melanomas (Fig. 1B). In general, there was a strong
correlation between relative protein and relative RNA expression
when compared across the 13 cell lines evaluated. In some
examples (i.e., DM6 and DM646), relative protein expression was
lower than expected based on relative RNA expression. This is not
unexpected as translational regulation of cadherins is likely to vary

Targeting N-Cadherin to Enhance Cytotoxic Chemotherapy

across cells (21). All but one cell line (DM733) expresses
N-cadherin, and for three (DM175, DM366, and DM751), only
N-cadherin expression was detectable. The observed pattern of
cadherin expression is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that loss of E-cadherin with a concomitant gain of
N-cadherin is common in melanoma (5, 22). Representative IHC
staining of N- and E-cadherin is shown in Fig. 1C for two
melanoma xenografts—DM738 and DM366. Although N-cadherin
expression is clear in xenograft DM366, there was no detectable
N-cadherin expression in xenograft DM738 as measured by IHC.
Matched Western blots for DM366 and DM738 cell line and
xenograft samples (Fig. 1D), however, showed clear expression of
N-cadherin across all samples. Notably, staining for N-cadherin was
lower in xenografts compared with the matched cell line and may
represent reduced expression of N-cadherin after s.c. injection and
in vivo growth. The negative IHC results for DM738 N-cadherin
expression may represent reduced sensitivity in IHC measurements
compared with direct protein analysis. Results, however, were
consistent with protein and RNA analysis in cell lines in that
N-cadherin staining was higher in DM366 then in DM738, whereas
E-cadherin was higher in DM738 compared with DM366.
Inhibition of N-cadherin binding augments chemotherapy.
To study the effects of N-cadherin antagonism, we used an animal
model of regional therapy (ILI) for extremity melanoma (15, 23),
melphalan, and the treatment protocol illustrated (Fig. 2A). ADH-1
alone had a nonsignificant effect on tumor growth rate in DM366,
a high N-cadherin–expressing xenograft (Fig. 2B). Although DM366
responded well to melphalan, the combination of ADH-1 with
melphalan was significantly (P < 0.005) more effective (Fig. 2B and
C). We evaluated the extent to which ADH-1 can overcome
resistance to melphalan with the xenograft DM738, which does not
respond to melphalan alone (Fig. 2D). ADH-1 alone had a
nonsignificant tumor growth–accelerating effect; however, when
ADH-1 was used in combination with melphalan, tumor growth
was significantly (P < 0.005) slowed. Table 1 summarizes these
results. ADH-1 was not cytotoxic or associated with any adverse
events (nadir body weight did not exceed 5% from baseline for
animals treated with ADH-1 alone). Melphalan in combination with
ADH-1 was significantly more effective than melphalan alone when
evaluated across multiple variables including percent change in
tumor volume, partial and complete response rates, and regression.
To study the effects of N-cadherin antagonism in combination
with systemic chemotherapy with temozolomide, we used a mouse
model of melanoma. Xenograft DM366 was moderately sensitive
to temozolomide alone (Fig. 3A). When temozolomide was used
in combination with ADH-1 (Fig. 3B), there was a slight, not
statistically significant improvement in response (Fig. 3A; P = 0.16).
We evaluated the degree to which N-cadherin disruption can
overcome resistance to temozolomide with the melanoma
xenograft A375, an N-cadherin–expressing (ref. 22; Fig. 1A) and
temozolomide-resistant xenograft. The treatment protocol
(Fig. 3D) included three daily ADH-1 doses before initiating
chemotherapy with temozolomide. Neither temozolomide nor
ADH-1 alone had an effect on tumor growth rate (Fig. 3C);
however, when temozolomide was used in combination with
ADH-1, tumor growth was slowed (P < 0.05). These results are
summarized in Table 1. As in the regional studies, ADH-1 was not
cytotoxic or associated with any adverse events.
Inhibition of N-cadherin binding alters intracellular signaling and increases apoptosis. To identify intracellular signaling
changes that could account for these responses to ADH-1, we

performed a series of nonsurvival studies using xenograft DM366
and our animal model of regional ILI with melphalan (Fig. 2A).
There was a marked increase in apoptosis in melphalan plus
ADH-1 compared with melphalan or ADH-1 alone as measured
using immunohistochemical staining of fragmented DNA ends
(FragEL; Fig. 4A). To test whether this increased apoptosis was due
to increased formation of DNA adducts, we used the antibody
MP5/73, which is specific for melphalan-DNA adducts (18, 20).
There was an increase in the number of cells staining positively
for adducts at 24 h post-ILI in melphalan plus ADH-1 compared
with melphalan alone (Fig. 4A). As expected, there were no adducts
formed in either saline or ADH-1 alone.
To gain further insight into the mechanism by which ADH-1 in
combination with melphalan leads to increases in apoptosis, cell
death, and tumor regression, we measured the expression of several
signaling proteins 4 h after completion of ILI (Fig. 4B). Expression
of N-cadherin and h-catenin, which is associated with the
intracellular domain of N-cadherin adhesion complexes, did not
change in response to treatment (data not shown). Focal adhesion
kinase and Src kinase, important in the transduction of signals
from sites of cell adhesion (24), showed no change in expression in
response to treatment nor did the levels of their phosphorylated
forms (data not shown).
N-cadherin functionally interacts with and stabilizes the FGF
receptor type 1 (FGFR-1; ref. 25), which can lead to increased
survival and invasiveness of the tumor cell (26). Although FGFR-1
expression did not change with either melphalan or ADH-1 alone, it
decreased markedly in the melphalan plus ADH-1 treatment group
(Fig. 4B). The adaptor protein paxillin is important in the linking of
signals from integrins and growth factor receptors to actincytoskeletal structures and, ultimately, to cell motility and
migration (27). Whereas expression of total paxillin did not change
in response to treatment, pPaxillin decreased slightly in ADH-1
alone and markedly in melphalan plus ADH-1 (Fig. 4B). The

adaptor proteins Crk and Crk-like (Crk/CrkL), similar to and often
in association with paxillin, play a critical role in the regulation of
actin cytoskeleton, cell migration, and survival (28). Phosphorylation of Crk/CrkL is regulated by both Abl kinase (29) and epidermal
growth factor receptor–dependent phosphorylation (30). Expression of Abl kinase and the associated Arg kinase did not change
across the treatment groups (Fig. 4B). Expression of CrkL
decreased in the ADH-1 and melphalan plus ADH-1 treatment
groups, whereas phosphorylated Crk/CrkL increased slightly in
ADH-1 alone and markedly in the melphalan plus ADH-1 treatment
groups (Fig. 4B). It has been shown that engagement of N-cadherin
adhesion complexes can inhibit apoptotic signaling by way of the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway (31).
Although we observed no change in the expression of total Akt,
there was a marked increase in phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) in
melphalan plus ADH-1 (Fig. 4B).

Discussion
We have shown that the pentapeptide ADH-1 can enhance the
effectiveness of regional or systemic chemotherapy in melanoma.
The mechanism by which this occurs is complex and may involve
increased formation of melphalan-DNA adducts and alterations in
focal adhesions and FGFR signaling.
In this study, two animal models were used in combination
with a panel of melanoma xenografts—a model of regional
chemotherapy with ILI of melphalan and a murine model of
systemic chemotherapy with temozolomide. The advantage of the
regional therapeutic strategy is that modulators, such as the
N-cadherin antagonist ADH-1, can be given systemically in
combination with high doses of regionally administered chemotherapy. Melphalan, a phenylalanine derivative and alkylating
agent, is one of the drugs of choice for regional infusion (32, 33)
chemotherapy for in transit, extremity melanoma. Temozolomide

is a methylating and monofunctional alkylating agent with a
mechanism of action similar to dacarbazine, currently the most
widely prescribed drug for systemic treatment of patients with
metastatic melanoma (34). Although not Food and Drug Administration–approved for melanoma temozolomide is increasingly
used due to its oral formulation and ability to penetrate the blood
brain barrier. Response rates of 13.5% have been reported for
temozolomide when used as a single agent (35).
There are several drugs in various stages of clinical trials that
selectively target pathways frequently dysregulated in cancer (2).
Targeted therapeutics are often not inherently cytotoxic, and
although response rates to these drugs alone have been modest, it
is likely that when used in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, response rates will be enhanced. Our results clearly show
the therapeutic potential of combination treatment strategies.
ADH-1 was neither cytotoxic nor associated with any adverse
events in these studies when used alone or in conjunction with
either regionally administered melphalan or systemically administered temozolomide.
ADH-1 alone showed negligible effects on tumor growth in both
the DM366 and A375 xenografts when compared with salinematched controls. We did note a slight, not statistically significant
(P > 0.1), increase in tumor growth after treatment with ADH-1
alone in the DM738 xenograft. Across all models studied, the
therapeutic advantage of ADH-1 came when it was used in
combination with chemotherapy. The slight enhancement of
DM738 tumor growth with ADH-1, if real, may represent a unique

www.aacrjournals.org

signaling event in response to ADH-1 disruption of N-cadherin
adhesion complexes. Future studies will monitor the growthpromoting effects of ADH-1 as a single agent to determine the
extent to which it occurs, whether there is a relationship between
this response and the molecular properties of the tumor and the
nature of the intracellular signaling pathways that confer this
response.
The response to ADH-1 in combination with regional chemotherapy with melphalan was more dramatic than the response to
ADH-1 in combination with systemic chemotherapy with temozolomide. Comparing responses to chemotherapy in combination
with ADH-1 in our two most resistant xenografts, there was a
30-fold reduction in percent change in tumor volume at day 20
when melphalan was used (DM738 xenograft), whereas there was
only a 2-fold reduction in this same response measured at day 23
when temozolomide was used (A375 xenograft). The difference in
the ability of ADH-1 to enhance responsiveness in chemoresistant
tumors may be a function of the properties of each of these
xenografts. However, the less chemoresistant xenograft, DM366,
which was studied with both chemotherapy agents, likewise
showed reduced responsiveness in the setting of systemic
chemotherapy with temozolomide (compare Figs. 2B and 3A).
This suggests that the drug (melphalan versus temozolomide) and/
or drug delivery (systemic versus regional infusion) may be
important factors in the enhanced response to chemotherapy.
Doses of chemotherapy given in the regional setting compared with
the systemic setting are much higher, and it is possible that better

Figure 4. Altered intracellular signaling in response to ADH-1. A, IHC of tissue slices taken from saline, melphalan, ADH-1, and melphalan plus ADH-1 treated
samples. Apoptosis was measured as the number of FragEL (left ), whereas melphalan-DNA adducts were measured using the antibody MP5/73 (right ). The fraction of
apoptotic cells (left) was higher in the melphalan plus ADH-1 treatment group as evidenced by the prominent staining of FragEL (brown ) and the nearly total
absence of nuclear (blue, hematoxylin) staining. DNA adduct formation (right ) was higher (brown stain ) in the ADH-1 plus melphalan–treated samples compared
with the melphalan alone–treated samples. As expected, no DNA adduct staining was seen in samples that were not exposed to melphalan. B, clarified cell lysates
(10–20 mg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the following antibodies: FGFR-1, paxillin, pPaxillin, pY207CrkL/pY221Crk, CrkL, Abl/Arg, pAkt,
Akt, and Actin, as a loading control. Bound antibodies were detected using a chemiluminescence visualization kit.

systemic responses might be seen with either higher dosing or
repeated cycles of systemic chemotherapy. The mechanism of
action of melphalan and temozolomide are different as is cellular
uptake where amino acid transport is important for melphalan but
not for temozolomide (36)—these factors may effect the effectiveness of ADH-1 in combination with chemotherapy. Further studies
will help elucidate the mechanism by which ADH-1 enhances
chemotherapy and how this may depend on the chemotherapy
agent and mode of delivery.
The cytotoxic actions of melphalan derive from the formation of
DNA adducts and subsequent initiation of apoptosis and cell death
(37, 38). The increased formation of DNA adducts in the melphalan
plus ADH-1–treated xenografts suggests that the increased
apoptosis observed in these xenografts was at least in part a
consequence of enhanced adduct formation. Potentially contributing further to the enhanced cytotoxic action of melphalan were
changes in several signaling proteins. CrkL and Crk are downstream targets of Abl/Arg nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (39, 40), and
the increased phosphorylation of the CrkL/Crk proteins we
observed suggests an increase in the activity of Abl or Arg kinase.
Downstream consequences of the increased phosphorylation in
CrkL/Crk proteins are complex but could include inhibition of cell
migration and survival, disassembly of focal adhesions, and
increased apoptosis (40)—actions that are consistent with the

increased apoptosis and tumor regression observed in the
melphalan plus ADH-1 treatment groups. Like CrkL/Crk proteins,
paxillin serves largely as an adaptor protein in focal adhesion
complexes (27). pPaxillin is important in the regulation of focal
adhesion assembly and associates with Crk/CrkL—important for
cell motility (41, 42). Decreased phosphorylation of paxillin in
response to ADH-1 could lead to both a loss of integrity of focal
adhesion complexes and decreased association with Crk/CrkL,
which could lead to increased apoptosis. Further studies will help
clarify the link between N-cadherin disruption, increased CrkL/Crk
phosphorylation, decreased paxillin phosphorylation, and why, in
the presence of a DNA-damaging agent, such as melphalan,
apoptosis and tumor regression increased so dramatically.
The observed changes in FGFR-1 expression after disruption of
N-cadherin binding are consistent with previous reports (43), which
showed that FGFR-1 stability at the membrane is dependent on its
association with N-cadherin. These results hint that ADH-1 is
disrupting extracellular N-cadherin adhesion, altering the association of N-cadherin and FGFR-1, and destabilizing FGFR-1.
Potential downstream consequences of a loss of expression of
FGFR-1 include altered signaling in the Ras g protein pathway,
inhibition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (44, 45), and
decreased cell survival (46) consistent with the observed increases
in cell death and tumor regression.

Targeting N-Cadherin to Enhance Cytotoxic Chemotherapy

The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, which is downstream of
the PI3K signaling pathway, is an important cell survival protein
and in its active or phosphorylated state (pAkt) can inhibit
apoptosis. Our observation that pAkt increased in response to
ADH-1 plus melphalan, although not consistent with the observed
increase in apoptosis, may represent a compensatory mechanism
in response to cell stress. Furthermore, it has been reported that
high activity of Akt in breast cancer cell lines was not associated
with decreased susceptibility to apoptosis nor did inhibition of Akt
act to increase susceptibility (47).
Our results show for the first time the marked effectiveness of a
novel therapeutic approach to melanoma treatment involving
targeted therapy against the N-cadherin molecule to synergistically
help improve both regional and systemic chemotherapy responses.
ADH-1, a unique peptide designed to target N-cadherin adhesion
complexes, shows minimal antitumor affects alone but dramatically
improves tumor response in two different melanoma models using
two different chemotherapies. ADH-1 treatment seems to make
tumor cells more susceptible to apoptosis, which in the setting of
regional therapy with melphalan is secondary to increased DNA
adduct formation and activation of signaling pathways that may
lower cellular threshold to apoptosis. As further studies focus on
more clearly defining the mechanism behind the synergistic

response, clinical phase I studies have already begun in both the
regional and systemic settings with combination ADH-1 and
chemotherapy. Given that the mean survival for patients with
metastatic melanoma is only 6 to 9 months, new approaches such as
targeting N-cadherin provide hope for improvement in current
chemotherapeutic strategies.
