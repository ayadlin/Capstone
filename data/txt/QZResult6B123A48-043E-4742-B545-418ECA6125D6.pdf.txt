Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Targeted therapies have demonstrated efficacy against specific subsets of molecularly defined
cancers1–4. Although most patients with lung cancer are stratified according to a single oncogenic
driver, cancers harbouring identical activating genetic mutations show large variations in their
responses to the same targeted therapy1,3. The biology underlying this heterogeneity is not well
understood, and the impact of co-existing genetic mutations, especially the loss of tumour
suppressors5–9, has not been fully explored. Here we use genetically engineered mouse models to
conduct a ‘co-clinical’ trial that mirrors an ongoing human clinical trial in patients with KRASmutant lung cancers. This trial aims to determine if the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244)10
increases the efficacy of docetaxel, a standard of care chemotherapy. Our studies demonstrate that
concomitant loss of either p53 (also known as Tp53) or Lkb1 (also known as Stk11), two
clinically relevant tumour suppressors6,9,11,12, markedly impaired the response of Kras-mutant
cancers to docetaxel monotherapy. We observed that the addition of selumetinib provided
substantial benefit for mice with lung cancer caused by Kras and Kras and p53 mutations, but
mice with Kras and Lkb1 mutations had primary resistance to this combination therapy.
Pharmacodynamic studies, including positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed
tomography (CT), identified biological markers in mice and patients that provide a rationale for
the differential efficacy of these therapies in the different genotypes. These co-clinical results
identify predictive genetic biomarkers that should be validated by interrogating samples from
patients enrolled on the concurrent clinical trial. These studies also highlight the rationale for
synchronous co-clinical trials, not only to anticipate the results of ongoing human clinical trials,
but also to generate clinically relevant hypotheses that can inform the analysis and design of
human studies.
Activating KRAS mutations are found in 15–30% of all patients with non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), and predict poor outcome in response to conventional treatment
regimens13,14. Preclinical studies have suggested that inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase
(MEK) may be effective against KRAS-mutant NSCLC15, prompting an ongoing human
clinical trial comparing docetaxel monotherapy (standard of care) to docetaxel combined
with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244). Although the sole genetic entry criteria for

patients on this trial is the presence of KRAS mutations, the complexity of NSCLC dictates
that many tumours will harbour concomitant genetic alterations that may modulate response
to therapy. To mirror this human clinical trial in a murine co-clinical trial, and to investigate
the modulating effects of concomitant tumour suppressor loss, we generated cohorts of
genetically engineered mice with either Kras, Kras and p53 (Kras/p53) or Kras/Lkb1 mutant
lung cancers. Activation of Kras(G12D) and inactivation of p53 or Lkb1 in the lung
epithelium was achieved using nasal instillation of adenovirus encoding the CRE
recombinase7. Mice with established disease, defined by tachypnoea, hypoxaemia on pulse
oximetry16, and bulk disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)17, were randomized to
receive either docetaxel 16 mg kg−1 every other day by intraperitoneal injection18
(Supplementary Table 1), selumetinib at 25 mg kg−1 daily by oral gavage19, or docetaxel in
combination with selumetinib. Treatment response was determined by serial MRI. Tumour
volumes were reconstructed from the MRI images (Supplementary Fig. 1a) with a high level
of interoperator reliability (Supplementary Fig. 1b; 95% confidence interval, −25.6% to
+31.4%). On the basis of these performance metrics, and paralleling human response
criteria, we used a threshold of 30% change in tumour volume to define progressive disease
and partial response.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For tumours with only Kras mutation, treatment with docetaxel monotherapy resulted in a
modest rate of response, with 30% of mice achieving a partial response (Fig. 1a, c). Mice
bearing Kras tumours with concurrent loss of p53 or Lkb1 had markedly lower response
rates to docetaxel treatment (5% and 0%, respectively), and more of these animals
demonstrated progressive disease on MRI or progression to moribundity (Fig. 1a and
Supplementary Table 2). The addition of selumetinib to docetaxel treatment provided
substantial benefit (Fig. 1b, c), with the overall response rate increased to 92% in Krasmutant cancers (P =2.8 × 10−5, Fisher exact test compared to docetaxel alone) and 61% in
Kras/p53 mice (P =2.7 × 10−4). In contrast, for Kras/Lkb1 mutant cancers the addition of
selumetinib to docetaxel led to only a modest improvement in overall response, with 33% of
the mice achieving a partial response (Fig. 1b, c). Compared to the other genotypes, Kras/
Lkb1 mice had a significantly lower rate of response to combined treatment with
selumetinib and docetaxel (P =0.0009, 3 ×2 contingency Fisher exact test).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The magnitude of change in volume confirmed that tumours with Kras or Kras/p53
mutations were considerably more responsive to combination therapy compared to docetaxel
alone. In contrast, the addition of selumetinib did not significantly reduce the volume of
tumours with compound Kras/Lkb1 mutations (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1c, d).
Concordantly, histopathological assessments of tumours collected after two doses of
treatment revealed that the combination treatment increased apoptosis (Fig. 1e and
Supplementary Fig. 2a) and reduced proliferation(Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2b) in the
Kras and Kras/p53 tumours compared to docetaxel alone, but this was not observed in Kras/
Lkb1 tumours (Fig. 1e, f and Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). These results demonstrate that
combined treatment with selumetinib and docetaxel induces apoptosis and decreases
proliferation in Kras and Kras/p53 tumours, leading to antitumour efficacy, but that
concomitant mutation of Lkb1 confers primary resistance to the combination treatment.
Because repeated tumour biopsies are difficult in patients, we explored the use of 18Ffluoro-2-deoxy-glucose PET (FDG-PET) as an early response indicator that could be used in
the clinic. Comparison of FDG avidity, quantified by standardized uptake value (SUV)20,21
in lung cancers across the three different genotypes showed an overall higher FDG uptake in
both Kras/p53 and Kras/Lkb1 tumours compared to Kras tumours (Fig. 2a; P =0.02, oneway ANOVA). Expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 (also known as SLC2A1) was
elevated in Kras/Lkb1 mutant tumours (Supplementary Fig. 3a), consistent with the
increased baseline FDG-PET signal. To determine if this finding was applicable to human

patients, we determined the pre-treatment FDG avidity in nine patients with KRAS-mutated
lung cancer. Tumours from three patients positive for LKB1 immunostaining had a mean
maximum SUV (SUVmax) of 2.33, whereas tumours from six patients negative for LKB1
immunostaining had a mean SUVmax of 8.75 (Fig. 2b; P = 0.048, two-sided Wilcoxon).
We next used FDG-PET to assess early tumour metabolic changes after initiation of therapy.
Treatment with docetaxel alone did not result in significant changes in tumour
hypermetabolism in Kras-, Kras/p53-or Kras/Lkb1-tumour-bearing mice (Fig. 2c, d). Of
note, some of the murine Kras lung cancer nodules were not FDG avid (Fig. 2a) and these
were the most sensitive to single-agent docetaxel (data not shown). In contrast, within 24 h
of the first dose of treatment with docetaxel and selumetinib, tumour hypermetabolism was
markedly suppressed in both Kras and Kras/p53 mice (Fig. 2c, d). However, Kras/Lkb1mutant tumours had no appreciable decrease in FDG avidity when treated with the
combination (Fig. 2c, d). Together, these results demonstrate that early changes in tumour
metabolism measured by FDG-PET (Fig. 2c, d) are concordant with histopathological
analysis of apoptosis and proliferation (Fig. 1e, f) and predict antitumour efficacy (Fig. 1a–
c) of docetaxel and selumetinib in treating Kras-mutant lung cancers.

To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of treatment on the MEK–ERK signalling axis, we
assayed pathway activation using phospho-ERK immunostaining of lung cancer nodules. At
baseline, the ERK pathway was most activated in Kras/p53-mutant tumours (Fig. 3a, b). We
observed substantially less phospho-ERK staining in Kras/Lkb1 tumours, suggesting that the
MEK–ERK pathway is not highly activated in these cancers. Treatment with docetaxel did
not alter phospho-ERK staining, but, as expected, the addition of selumetinib decreased
MEK–ERK signalling in the Kras and Kras/p53 tumours (Fig. 3a, b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We further evaluated cellular signalling from short-term-treated lung cancer nodules by
immunoblotting tumour lysates. Concordant with immunostaining (Fig. 3a), elevated
phospho-ERK and phospho-90RSK were observed in Kras/p53 tumours relative to the other
genotypes (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 4a). Kras/Lkb1 tumours displayed low basal
activation of the MEK–ERK pathway (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 4a), consistent with
immunostaining (Fig. 3a). Treatment with docetaxel had no discernable impact on the
MEK–ERK pathway in any genotype (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Although
selumetinib alone resulted in decreased phospho-ERK, residual activity was still present
(Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Treatment with both docetaxel and selumetinib more
effectively eradicated phospho-ERK activity (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 4b).
Pharmacokinetic studies suggested that selumetinib levels were elevated in the serum and
tumours of mice treated with selumetinib combined with docetaxel compared to selumetinib
alone (Supplementary Table 3), perhaps providing a mechanism for the more potent
suppression of MEK–ERK signalling by the combination (Fig. 3c). The potential relevance
of these findings to human disease was investigated by assessing phospho-ERK staining in a
set of 57 human NSCLC tumour samples with known KRAS, p53 and LKB1 mutation
status. Consistent with our findings in murine tumours, of seven patients harbouring the
KRAS activating mutation, the three patients with concurrent p53 loss showed higher
phospho-ERK activity (Fig. 3d).
The decreased activation of ERK phosphorylation in Kras/Lkb1 tumours suggests that the
proliferation of these tumours may be driven through other signalling pathways. On the
basis of our prior studies19,22, we investigated the activity of AKT and SRC in Kras/Lkb1
mutant tumours. Immunoblotting with activation-state-specific antibodies revealed that
Kras/Lkb1-mutant tumours have heightened activation of both AKT and SRC
(Supplementary Fig. 3a, b), consistent with the finding of increased FDG avidity in Kras/
Lkb1 tumours (Fig. 2a, b), because PI3K regulates expression of GLUT1 (Supplementary

Fig. 3a). These results suggest that concomitant mutation of Kras and Lkb1 may alter the
signalling circuitry in tumour cells from one dependent on MEK–ERK (in Kras and Kras/
p53 tumours) to one that has more active AKT and SRC pathways, resulting in primary
resistance to docetaxel and selumetinib.
The concurrent human clinical trial does not include a treatment arm in which patients are
treated with selumetinib alone, based on lack of efficacy in a phase II clinical trial in patients
with NSCLC23, and on our preclinical data in Kras genetically engineered mice19. In mice
with Kras, Kras/p53 and Kras/Lbk1 tumours, treatment with selumetinib alone resulted in a
heterogeneous reduction in FDG-PET uptake (Supplementary Fig. 5a), consistent with
pharmacodynamic evidence that selumetinib alone partially attenuates MEK–ERK
signalling within tumours (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). However, no partial
responses were achieved in any genotype with selumetinib monotherapy, although there was
attenuation of tumour growth compared to untreated controls (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
Together, these data suggest that selumitinib as monotherapy modulates MEK–ERK
signalling in Kras-driven tumours, but is insufficient for clinical benefit in mice and humans.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We determined the long-term benefit of combined treatment with docetaxel and selumetinib
in the Kras- and Kras/p53-mutant mice compared to chronic treatment with docetaxel
monotherapy. We did not assess long-term treatment outcome in Kras/Lkb1 animals given
the primary resistance to both treatments in these animals (Figs 1–3). In mice with Kras
tumours, treatment with docetaxel alone stabilized disease for several weeks, whereas the
addition of selumetinib caused frank tumour regression and slower tumour re-growth (Fig.
4a and Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Accordingly, the addition of selumetinib to docetaxel
significantly prolonged progression-free survival (Fig. 4b). In mice with Kras/p53 tumours,
treatment with docetaxel alone largely resulted in progressive disease, whereas animals
treated with a combination of docetaxel and selumetinib had initial disease regression before
progression (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 6c), resulting in prolonged progression-free
survival (Fig. 4c). These results demonstrate that the enhanced response to treatment with
combined therapy translates to improved progression-free survival, albeit not outright cure,
in mice bearing Kras- and Kras/p53-mutant tumours.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate mechanisms of resistance upon disease progression, tumour nodules were
isolated from moribund animals after long-term treatment with docetaxel and selumetinib. In
all animals examined (5/5 in Kras/p53 and 11/11 in Kras), tumour nodules showed
recrudescence of ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 7a), suggesting that
acquired resistance could be partly due to reactivation of MEK–ERK signalling despite
ongoing treatment with selumetinib. We evaluated treatment-resistant nodules for ERK
amplification (Supplementary Fig. 7b), activation of parallel signalling pathways
(Supplementary Fig. 7c), and drug pharmacokinetics (Supplementary Fig. 7d), and did not
find consistent changes, suggesting more than one mechanism for pathway reactivation.
Efforts to identify the diversity of mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance are
ongoing.
This co-clinical study provides several insights and predictions that affect the interpretation
of the concurrent human clinical trial. First, these results predict that combination therapy
with docetaxel and selumetinib will be more effective than docetaxel alone in several
subclasses of KRAS-mutant NSCLC. These data are consistent with the results of the human
phase II clinical trial described in a recent press release
(http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=123810&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1611800).
However, our studies predict that concurrent mutation of LKB1 will confer primary
resistance to combination therapy, possibly through activation of parallel signalling
pathways such as AKT and SRC. As LKB1 status is not being prospectively assessed in the

ongoing human clinical trial, inclusion of patients with cancers harbouring concurrent LKB1
mutations may blunt differences between treatment arms based solely on KRAS status.
These results suggest that a retrospective analysis of p53 and LKB1 status in samples from
the concurrent human clinical trial is warranted, and lead us to advocate prospective analysis
in future clinical trials with sufficient enrolment to all strata to enable sufficiently powered
sub-group analyses.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Beyond assessing genetic modulators, co-clinical studies allow for validation of biomarker
strategies and discovery of mechanisms of resistance that may benefit future clinical trials.
In this study, we observed the potential utility of FDG-PET imaging as a biomarker strategy
for identifying an enriched responder population and predicting long-term outcome. Prior
studies have suggested that lung tumour hypermetabolism at the time of diagnosis predicts
poor outcome in response to conventional therapies20,24, our current study further suggests
that high baseline FDG avidity may predict poor response to targeted therapy with
selumetinib combined with docetaxel. Specifically, loss of LKB1 function appears to confer
increased FDG avidity, probably through upregulated expression of glucose transporters. As
current approaches for assessing LKB1 status are not comprehensive, FDG-PET imaging
may represent a practicable patient stratification strategy. Furthermore, the current
preclinical study suggests a role for repeat FDG-PET imaging early in the course of
treatment as a potential predictor of outcome, as metabolic changes may be apparent within
24 h of initiating therapy. In these studies, we also observed reactivation of the MEK–ERK
signalling pathway in mice that became resistant to the combination of selumetinib and
docetaxel. Although the exact mechanisms responsible for pathway reactivation remain to
be elucidated, mechanisms of resistance discovered in co-clinical studies should be
confirmed in human clinical trials by examining biopsy samples from patients who relapse
on therapy. The ability to assess mechanisms of resistance in the preclinical setting may
uncover rational combinatorial strategies that can be implemented in future clinical studies.
Building upon prior success using genetically engineered mouse models25–27, the current
study demonstrates that co-clinical trials can provide data that has value beyond predicting
the outcome of clinical trials, and can rapidly generate new clinically relevant hypotheses
that can affect how the concurrent human clinical trial is analysed, and inform the design of
future clinical studies. As similar efforts are undertaken in other cancer disease types, we
anticipate that murine co-clinical trials will enable more effective oncology drug
development.

METHODS SUMMARY
Mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mouse strains harbouring a conditional activating mutation (G12D) at the endogenous Kras
locus, conditional Lkb1 knockout, and conditional p53 knockout were described
previously7. Genotypes were confirmed by PCR (Supplementary Fig. 8). All studies were
performed on protocols approved by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and University of North
Carolina Animal Care and Use Committees, and all mice used are listed in Supplementary
Table 4.
MRI quantification
3D Slicer was used to reconstruct MRI volumetric measurements28,29 (Supplementary Fig.
1a). To assess variation between independent operators, Bland–Altman analysis was
performed using quantification results from the two operators on a total of 16 MRI scan
images (Supplementary Fig. 1b).

Pharmacokinetics

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Docetaxel concentrations in serum, lung, and tumour nodules was determined using
published doses (8 and 16 mg kg−1). Drug concentration was determined 3 h after the last
dose (Supplementary Table 1). All serum concentrations were within the range found in the
clinical setting30. Selumetinib was administered as previously described19, and
pharmacokinetics in mice were also documented (Supplementary Table 3).
PET/CT studies
All murine FDG-PET/CT studies were performed with a pre-clinical small animal PET/CT
system (Siemens Inveon) after injection with 14 MBq of 18F-FDG. Mice used for PET/CT
studies are listed in Supplementary Table 5.
Human samples and clinical information
All human samples and clinical information were obtained under Institutional Review Board
approved protocols (02-180 and 07-0120), and patient information is listed in
Supplementary Tables 7 and 8. A tissue microarray (TMA) was generated from genotyped
human lung cancer samples as previously described7. The TMA was immunostained for
phospho-ERK and scored by a pathologist blinded to patient information.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemistry staining
Immunohistochemical analyses assessing phospho-ERK, activated caspase 3, and Ki-67
were performed as previously described19. Scoring was done by a pathologist, using the
same parameters used for scoring human specimens.

Figure 1. Docetaxel and selumetinib combination therapy is more efficacious than docetaxel
monotherapy in Kras and Kras/p53 lung cancers

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, Waterfall plot showing tumour response after 2 weeks of docetaxel treatment at 16 mg
kg−1 every 2 days. Each column represents one individual mouse, with data expressed
relative to the pre-treatment tumour volume. b, Waterfall plot showing tumour response
after 2 weeks of docetaxel treatment at 16 mg kg−1 every 2 days in combination with daily
selumetinib at 25 mg kg−1. c, Response rate of docetaxel and selumetinib combination
therapy and docetaxel only in mice bearing tumours with different genotypes. d, Box plot
showing tumour response for different genotypes with either docetaxel monotherapy (D) or
combination treatment (DS). Lines depict median response, small circles indicate outliers.
Estimated magnitude of difference between single and combination treatment within each
genotype and corresponding one-sided P values obtained by likelihood ratio test. e, f,
Number of activated caspase-3 (e) and Ki-67 (f) positive cells per microscopic field in mice
of different genotypes after short-term treatment. Data represent the average of 5 different
fields ± standard deviation (s.d.) from 1–3 different mice (see Supplementary Table 6 for

Figure 2. FDG-PET predicts treatment response

a, FDG-PET signal intensity (SUVmax) in Kras, Kras/p53 and Kras/Lkb1 mutant mice.
Statistical significance determined by rank sum test, with *P <0.05 for Kras compared to
Kras/p53 mutant mice (P =0.019), and Kras compared to Kras/Lkb1 mutant mice (P
=0.014). b, FDG-PET signal intensity in patients with KRAS or KRAS/LKB1 mutant
tumours. Statistical significance determined by two-sided Wilcoxon with *P = 0.048. c,
Comparisons of changes in FDG uptake by PET imaging after 1 day of treatment. Data are
represented as mean ± s.d. d, Representative FDG-PET/CT images of mice from different
genotypes at baseline and 1 day after initiation of treatment. For each animal, the baseline
and post-treatment (post-Rx) PET images are depicted with identical scales. The
pseudocoloured FDG-PET images are fused with the grey-scale cross-sectional CT images.

a, Immunostaining of phospho-ERK before and after treatment with docetaxel alone or in
combination with selumetinib. Scale bar, 50 μm. b, Pathology score of phospho-ERK
staining of mouse tumours shown in a. Both percentage of phospho-ERK positive cells and
average intensity of phospho-ERK staining were scored for individual nodules, with a
composite score derived by multiplying phospho-ERK positive percentage and average
intensity. All samples were stained in the same batch. D, docetaxel; DS, docetaxel plus
selumetinib; No Rx, untreated. c, Mice were subjected to treatment (two doses in 24 h) as
indicated, and killed 3 h after the second dose. Western blot was used to analyse tumour
lysates with the indicated antibodies. d, Human NSCLC patients grouped by mutation status
as indicated in the first column. Mean phospho-ERK (pERK) score from immunostaining is
shown for each subset.

Figure 4. Long-term treatment outcome in Kras and Kras/p53 mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, Tumour volume was longitudinally assessed by MRI imaging in Kras and Kras/p53 mice
treated with either docetaxel or docetaxel plus selumetinib. Data points represent median
tumour volume relative to start of treatment for all available data at the indicated time point.
b, Progression-free survival for Kras mice treated with either docetaxel or docetaxel plus
selumetinib. Median survival for single and combination treatments was 6 weeks and 12
weeks respectively, with ***P =0.0003 by log-rank test. c, Progression-free survival for
Kras/p53 mice treated with either docetaxel or docetaxel plus selumetinib. Median survival
for single and combination treatments was 2 weeks and 4 weeks, respectively, with ***P
<0.0001 by log-rank test. Progression was defined as the time point when total tumour
volume exceeded the baseline volume. d, Immunostaining of activation-specific phosphoERK of tumours from Kras/p53 and Kras mice with acquired resistance to docetaxel and
selumetinib treatment.
