BACKGROUND. The feasibility and accuracy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy
in patients with breast cancer after preoperative chemotherapy has been demonstrated in a number of large, single-institution studies. However, a relative contraindication to SLN biopsy after preoperative chemotherapy is the presence of
axillary metastases at initial diagnosis. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and accuracy of SLN biopsy after preoperative chemotherapy
in patients with documented axillary metastases at presentation.

METHODS. Between 1994 and 2002, 69 patients who had axillary metastases identified by ultrasound-guided, fine-needle aspiration underwent SLN biopsy after
treatment on prospective, preoperative chemotherapy protocols. All but 8
patients underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Those 8 patients ei-

RESULTS. The median patient age was 49 years, and the median primary tumor
(48.4%) had successfully mapped, positive SLNs. Sixty-one patients underwent
ALND, including 5 patients who did not have an SLN identified. In the 56
patients in whom a SLN was identified and an ALND was performed, 10 patients
had a false-negative SLN (25%).

CONCLUSIONS. SLN biopsy was feasible after preoperative chemotherapy, even in
patients who initially presented with cytologically proven, lymph node-positive
disease. However, the false-negative rate of SLN biopsy in this group of patients
was much higher than that observed in clinically lymph node-negative patients.
Based on the current results, the status of the SLN cannot be used as a reliable
indicator of the presence or absence of residual disease in the axilla in this
patient population. Cancer 2007;109:1255–63.  2007 American Cancer Society.

ne of the most important advances in the staging and surgical
treatment of patients with early-stage breast cancer has been
the introduction of lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node
(SLN) biopsy as an alternative to axillary lymph node dissection
(ALND). SLN biopsy provides a minimally invasive approach to
detecting lymph node metastases, thus defining a group of lymph
node-negative patients who may be spared the morbidity associated
with an ALND.1–4 In addition, because the SLN is sectioned serially
and is examined more thoroughly than the lymph nodes that are
recovered from a standard ALND, SLN biopsy also can improve the
accuracy of staging by increasing the detection of micrometastatic

disease that likely would have been missed with
standard pathologic assessment of the ALND specimen.5 Several single-institution and multicenter studies have demonstrated the staging accuracy and low
morbidity of lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy in
clinically lymph node-negative patients with earlystage breast cancer, with reported identification rates
and false-negative rates ranging from 84% to 100%
and from 0% to 13%, respectively.6,7
Preoperative chemotherapy, also known as
neoadjuvant or induction chemotherapy, is recognized as the standard of care for patients with locally
advanced breast cancer. In addition, because indications for systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy have broadened to include all invasive tumors that measure
>1 cm in greatest dimension regardless of axillary
status, increasing numbers of patients with earlystage breast cancer (stage I-IIB) currently are considered candidates for preoperative chemotherapy.8,9
Although large, multicenter studies have not demonstrated a disease-free or overall survival advantage
for preoperative chemotherapy versus conventional
postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, the use of preoperative chemotherapy does have several potential
advantages.8 First, decreasing the size of the primary
tumor with preoperative chemotherapy can convert
inoperable disease to operable disease and can allow
breast-conservation surgery for patients in whom
mastectomy initially was the only option for control
of local-regional disease.9–11 Second, preoperative
chemotherapy allows for an opportunity to evaluate
the in vivo chemosensitivity of the primary tumor
and, eventually, to correlate tumor response with
long-term outcome.12,13 In this way, patients who
have tumors that demonstrate an incomplete
response to preoperative chemotherapy are identified
as being at high risk for failure and can be offered alternative adjuvant chemotherapy regimens.14–16
Despite the increasing use of both SLN biopsy
and preoperative chemotherapy in the management
of breast cancer, there is still limited information on
the feasibility and accuracy of SLN biopsy after preoperative chemotherapy. It has been suggested that
chemotherapy may lead to fibrosis in the regional
lymphatics, and concerns have been raised regarding
the possibility of increased false-negative SLNs, inaccurate staging, and subsequent under treatment (eg,
omission of ALND or postoperative adjuvant therapy).17,18 To date, 16 single-institution or multicenter,
retrospective studies have been published that examined the feasibility and accuracy of SLN biopsy after
preoperative chemotherapy.17–32 SLN identification
rates range from 84% to 98%, and reported false-negative rates range from 0% to 20%. The overall accu-

racy of SLN biopsy after preoperative chemotherapy
for breast cancer ranges from 88% to 100%. A recent
meta-analysis of the published data suggested that
SLN biopsy is an accurate staging investigation of
the axilla after primary chemotherapy.33 However, all
of those studies were performed in patients who had
clinically negative lymph node status and excluded
patients with suspected or proven axillary metastases
prior to preoperative chemotherapy. Despite the finding that preoperative chemotherapy eradicates biopsy-proven axillary metastases in up to 40% of
patients,9,15,16,34 in most institutions, those patients
routinely undergo ALND. In theory, those patients
may not require ALND, because the axillary lymph
nodes are rendered clinically and pathologically negative.
At our institution, patients undergo a thorough
diagnostic evaluation at presentation prior to receiving preoperative chemotherapy. Patients with an
indeterminate or suspicious lymph node either on
physical examination or on diagnostic imaging
undergo fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of that
abnormal lymph node to document the presence of
metastatic disease. At the completion of preoperative
chemotherapy, patients are re-evaluated, and
patients who have a clinical response in the axilla
are offered lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy in
addition to standard ALND in an effort to improve
pathologic staging by identifying for the pathologist
the lymph nodes that are most likely to harbor metastatic disease.
The objective of the current study was to examine our experience with SLN biopsy after preoperative chemotherapy in this unique subset of patients
who present with cytologically proven axillary metastases. Specifically, we sought to answer 2 questions:
1) Can the SLN be identified reliably after preoperative chemotherapy; and 2) does the disease status of
the SLN, as determined by histologic examination,
accurately predict the axillary lymph node status? If
the value of SLN biopsy is demonstrated in this setting, then a proportion of initially lymph node-positive patients eventually could be spared from an
ALND if their involved SLNs are rendered disease
free after the administration of preoperative chemotherapy.

FNA biopsy was performed for clinically or ultrasonographically suspicious axillary lymph nodes. Sixtynine patients had axillary metastases identified, and
these patients formed the current study population.
To evaluate the feasibility of SLN biopsy in this particular population, patients with or without residual
adenopathy on physical examination after preoperative chemotherapy were included. Clinical response
also was assessed by axillary ultrasonography and
was categorized as normal/fatty-replaced lymph
nodes, indeterminate lymph nodes, and minimal
response/suspicious for residual disease. Because we
were uncertain about the reliability of physical examination and/or ultrasonography after chemotherapy,
we included patients who had residual adenopathy
based on physical examination or indeterminate
lymph nodes based on ultrasound examination.
Intraoperative lymphatic mapping was performed
after peritumoral injection of isosulfan blue dye alone,
technetium-labeled sulfur colloid alone, or a combination of both. Patients received 4 injections around the
primary tumor site, and nonpalpable tumors were
injected under mammographic or ultrasound guidance. All patients were offered concomitant ALND. A
false-negative event was defined as a negative SLN in
a patient with disease detected in 1 non-SLN.

RESULTS
Patient and Tumor Characteristics at Initial Presentation
The median patient age at the time of diagnosis was
49 years (range, 30–76 years). The majority of
patients were Caucasian (69.6%), 7 patients were
African American (10.1%), 8 patients were Hispanic
(11.6%), 5 patients were Asian (7.2%), and 1 patient
was of Middle Eastern descent (1.5%). Twenty-eight
patients (40.6%) were premenopausal, and the
remaining 41 patients were either perimenopausal or
postmenopausal (59.4%). Twenty-seven patients
(39.1%) had a family history of breast cancer in a
first- or second-degree relative.

Surgical Treatment and Pathologic Results
All 69 patients underwent attempted lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy. The majority of patients
(82.6%) underwent lymphatic mapping using a combination of radioactive colloid and blue dye (Table
5). Overall, there were 64 successful lymphatic mappings (92.8%) and 5 unsuccessful lymphatic mappings (7.2%). In 4 of 5 unsuccessful mappings
(80.0%), a combination of radiocolloid and blue dye
was used for SLN localization. In 3 patients, the axillary dissection specimen yielded axillary metastases.
In the 4 patients who underwent unsuccessful mapping with palpable adenopathy prior to the initiation
of chemotherapy, 2 patients continued to have a
clinically positive axilla at the time of surgery (Table 6).
Univariate analysis of clinicopathologic features associated with failure to identify an SLN revealed that
skin involvement (T4 disease) at the time of initial
presentation was associated significantly with a
decreased likelihood of identifying an SLN (66.7% vs
98.3%; P ¼ .002). Patient age, body mass index, history of a prior excisional biopsy, tumor location,
initial lymph node tumor burden, and surgeon experience were not correlated with the success of lymphatic mapping.
In the 64 patients who had successful mapping
procedures, there was a median of 2 SLNs removed
per patient (range, 1–10 SLNs removed per patient).
Thirty-one patients (48.4%) had 1 positive SLN;
and, in 8 of those patients (25.8%), the SLN was the
only positive lymph node. Ten patients had falsenegative findings, and the overall calculated falsenegative rate was 25.0% (Table 4). All of the patients
with false-negative SLN biopsy results had tumors
that measured 2 cm in greatest dimension. Of
6 patients who presented initially with palpable adenopathy prior to initiating chemotherapy, all of them
had complete resolution of their palpable adenopathy at the time of surgery (Table 7). Univariate analy-

sis of the standard clinicopathologic features
associated with a false-negative SLN failed to identify
any predictive factors.
Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were available for review from 24 patients with negative SLNs.
Detailed pathologic evaluation of those 24 patients
revealed that 1 of 10 patients with false-negative SLNs
had focal fibrosis that involved <5% of 1 lymph
node, whereas 9 of 14 patients with true-negative
SLNs had either fibrosis, a histiocytic infiltrate with
an adjacent thickened capsule, or fat necrosis with fibrosis in 1 SLN. These findings in true-negative
SLNs involved <5% of an SLN in 2 patients and from
5% to 50% of 1 SLN in 7 patients. Thus, there was
some histologic evidence of treatment effect (eg, fibrosis, a foamy histiocytic infiltrate, or fat necrosis
with fibrosis) in only 10% of patients with false-negative SLNs compared with 64% of patients with truenegative SLNs.

DISCUSSION
Axillary lymph node staging plays a critical role in
the management of patients with invasive breast
cancer. A standard level I and level II ALND provides
prognostic information, may guide subsequent chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment decisions,
and achieves durable regional control in patients
with axillary disease.19 However, significant morbidity
has been associated with ALND, including but not
limited to nerve injury, paresthesias, lymphedema,
and poor range of motion about the shoulder.35 In
early-stage breast cancer, where there is a lower likelihood of lymph node metastases, combined lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy is an accurate
predictor of the histopathologic status of the axillary
lymph nodes and rapidly is gaining acceptance as
the axillary staging procedure of choice in women
undergoing primary surgical therapy.1–7 However,

some have speculated that the disease status of the
SLN in patients who receive preoperative chemotherapy does not reflect accurately the disease status of
the entire axilla.13,17 Some reasons why lymphatic
mapping may not be successful or accurate after preoperative chemotherapy include 1) blockage of the
lymphatic channels by tumor emboli, inflammation,
or fibrosis, which may distort or impede the flow of
radiolabeled colloid or dye; 2) blockage of lymphatic
channels with viable or dead cellular material; 3)
patients who are selected for preoperative chemotherapy are more likely to have larger tumors, which
may have multiple sources of lymphatic drainage;
and 4) in patients who receive preoperative chemotherapy, the cytotoxic effect on the tumor may not
be uniform, with regression of metastatic disease in
some axillary lymph nodes but not in others.13,17
These factors could lead to both decreased SLN identification and increased false-negative SLNs. Nevertheless, published retrospective reviews of singleinstitution experiences and multicenter series and a
recent meta-analysis have shown that SLN identification rates and false-negative rates after preoperative
chemotherapy are comparable to the rates reported
in patients who did not receive preoperative chemotherapy.17–33
Preoperative chemotherapy with anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and taxane-containing regimens has been shown to sterilize involved axillary
lymph nodes in approximately 35% to 40% of
patients.15,16,34 Newer regimens in combination with
novel biologics likely will increase the conversion
rate even further. Thus, for patients with documented, positive axillary lymph node status (positive
FNA), preoperative chemotherapy and SLN biopsy
potentially could spare some patients an ALND. The
results of the current study indicate that combined
lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy is feasible in
patients with breast cancer who have demonstrated
axillary metastases at presentation and who are treated with preoperative chemotherapy, although the
false-negative rate is higher than the currently
accepted rate suggested for patients with early-stage
disease.
In the current study of 69 patients with metastatic disease in the axilla who underwent SLN biopsy after receiving preoperative chemotherapy, the
overall SLN identification rate was 92.9%, which is
similar to the rate reported in other series that
described SLN biopsy in patients with early-stage
breast cancer1–7 and in publications that described
SLN biopsy in patients with clinically lymph nodenegative breast cancer who received preoperative
chemotherapy.17–32 The SLN identification rate was

SLN After Preoperative Chemotherapy/Shen et al.

significantly lower in patients who had skin involvement at the time of initial presentation. We observed
no significant differences in the SLN identification
rate according to age, body mass index, clinical tumor size, tumor location, lymphatic mapping
method used, or surgeon experience. We did observe
a trend toward lower identification rates in patients
who had persistent, palpable lymphadenopathy after
they received preoperative chemotherapy (82.4% vs
96.2%; P ¼ .09), although the clinical status of the
lymph node basin itself was a poor indicator of the
pathologic status of the lymph nodes.
Unlike previously reported studies of lymphatic
mapping and SLN biopsy,1–7,17–32 the patients in the
current study all had cytologically documented positive lymph nodes at the time of initial presentation.
Although SLN identification technically was feasible,
the false-negative rate of 25% reported here is much
higher than that reported for other series on lymphatic mapping in breast cancer. Univariate analysis
of standard clinicopathologic features failed to identify any clinicopathologic characteristics or technical
variations that were predictive of an increased likelihood of a false-negative SLN. The presence of skin
involvement did not have an impact on the accuracy
of the SLN biopsy in this setting.
Patients who had negative SLN status were reevaluated histologically to determine whether there
were any pathologic characteristics that may be able
to distinguish a true-negative SLN from a false-negative SLN. We observed that false-negative SLNs were
less likely to display histologic evidence of treatment
effect than true-negative SLNs. If a complete
response to preoperative chemotherapy is accompanied by either fibrosis (ranging from 5% to 50%), a
foamy histiocytic infiltrate, or fat necrosis with fibrosis, then true-negative SLNs that are identified accurately after preoperative chemotherapy should have
1 more of these features. Non-SLNs may or may
not have been positive initially; therefore, if the identified SLN is actually a non-SLN, then it would be
less likely to have any of these features. Although the
number of patients is small, our findings support the
hypothesis that the lack of treatment effect in a
negative SLN is likely to be a surrogate for a falsenegative SLN. These patients should undergo a
completion ALND, because the identified SLN is
not a reliable indicator of their axillary lymph node
status.
There are several limitations as well as strengths
in our study. The limitations include the small sample size and the lack of a predetermined protocol
dictating the method of lymphatic mapping. In addition, because SLN biopsy generally was performed in

1261

the setting of a planned completion ALND, there was
no requirement for the surgeons to look at all of the
hot and/or blue lymph nodes prior to proceeding to
a completion lymph node dissection. The strengths
of our study include the fact that our practice setting
is a large-volume breast care practice with surgeons
who have substantial experience with lymphatic
mapping and SLN biopsy. In addition, the current
data were collected uniformly as part of a prospective database, which included a large number of
patients who underwent SLN biopsy.
Studies have shown that clinical examination
and ultrasound imaging of the axilla are not reliable
enough to predict precisely the pathologic status of
the axilla.36 Similarly, in our study, the absence of
palpable adenopathy and suspicious sonographic
findings were poor predictors of axillary lymph
node status after chemotherapy. Because some
patients who present initially with palpable adenopathy will not have any histologic evidence of
metastasis on final pathology, we used ultrasound
examination as an additional tool for evaluation of
these patients. Some patients continued to have
palpable adenopathy after chemotherapy but had a
sonographically negative axilla based on the standard criteria used at our institution. In addition,
some of our patients without palpable adenopathy
had indeterminate lymph nodes on ultrasound after
chemotherapy. We elected to include these patients
in our study population to determine whether
physical examination or ultrasound would be more
reliable for clinical assessment after chemotherapy.
It is possible that ultrasonography after chemotherapy would have been more reliable if we had used
FNA of any indeterminate or suspicious lymph
nodes. We realize that ultrasound examination is
subjective to false-negative results; however, with
the benefit of a pretreatment study for the purposes
of comparison, we believe that ultrasound is the
best imaging test available for the clinical assessment of lymph node disease after chemotherapy.
Clearly, new imaging modalities with better sensitivity and specificity need to be incorporated into
our clinical evaluation. Other diagnostic imaging
studies, including computed tomography, magnetic
resonance imaging, positron emission tomography,
and technetium-99m sestamibi imaging, all are limited in their sensitivity and specificity for determining the presence or absence of axillary lymph node
metastases.37–42 With a false-negative rate of 25%,
the SLN cannot be considered a reliable indicator
of the presence or absence of residual disease in
the axilla after chemotherapy in patients who present initially with lymph node-positive disease.

ALND remains the gold-standard axillary staging
procedure after chemotherapy for women who present with documented axillary metastases. Such an
approach, however, does not take advantage of the
fact that some patients will achieve eradication of
their lymph node disease with chemotherapy and
probably will not benefit from ALND. With reported
pathologic complete response rates of up to 40% in
the axilla after preoperative chemotherapy, our findings warrant continued investigation of lymphatic
mapping and SLN biopsy or alternative staging procedures in this population. If the false-negative
lymph nodes can be recognized by pathologic characteristics, then it may be possible to avoid axillary
dissection in women who truly have tumor-free
SLNs. This could reduce the morbidity of surgical
treatment while preserving postchemotherapy staging accuracy in this group of women with high-risk
breast cancer who have tumors that respond to
chemotherapy.
