ABSTRACT
Doxorubicin is a conventional and effective chemotherapy drug against
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, during long-term doxorubicin monotherapy,
HCC cells may eventually develop acquired-resistance to doxorubicin which results in
recurrence and a poor prognosis. Salinomycin, an ionophore antibiotic, was recently
reported to selectively kill human cancer stem cells (CSCs) which were response for
chemoresistance. In this study, salinomycin was found to exert synergistic cytotoxicity
with doxorubicin in HCC cells and be capable of inhibiting doxorubicin-induced
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an important cellular process involved in
the acquired chemoresistance of tumors. Further experiments revealed that FOXO3a,
a multifunctional transcription factor that can be activated by salinomycin, was vital
in mediating doxorubicin-induced EMT. In addition, activated FOXO3a disturbed the
interaction between β-catenin and TCF and inhibited the expression of β-catenin/TCF
target genes (ZEB1, c-Myc and CyclinD1), which played important roles in doxorubicininduced EMT in HCC cells. Finally, the enhanced curative efficacy of combination
treatment of doxorubicin and salinomycin for HCC was confirmed in established
xenograft models. In summary, the present study identifies a new doxorubicinbased chemotherapy for advanced HCC and provides a potential anti-cancer strategy
targeting FOXO3a and related cell pathway molecules.

Introduction

efficacy, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is
the only treatment that has shown a consistent survival
benefit in patients with intermediate HCC, and is currently
considered as the standard treatment for this population
in clinical guidelines [4]. Doxorubicin, an anthracyclinebased agent, is one of the most widely used anti-HCC
drug systematically or locally [5]; especially it is the
first-line chemotherapy agent for TACE [2-4]. However,
during long-term doxorubicin chemotherapy, HCC cells
may eventually develop acquired chemoresistance,

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
most intractable cancers worldwide, and has persistently
increasing rates of both incidence and mortality [1].
Treatments such as surgical resection, liver transplantation
or local ablation are available for early HCC, whereas for
intermediate and advanced HCC, chemotherapy may be
the only approach to control tumor progression [2, 3].
Although various chemotherapies have shown some

thereby leading to recurrence and a poor prognosis. In the
treatment of multiple tumors, combining doxorubicin with
other agents such as selenocystine [6], 20(S)-ginsenoside
Rg3 [7], JI-34 [8] and ganetespib [9], was found to exert
synergetic anticancer effects and improved doxorubicinbased chemotherapy. These reports indicated us that drug
combinations may potentially be a viable strategy to
improve the present situation of doxorubicin-resistance in
HCC cells.
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a
biological process during which polarized epithelial
cells transform into motile mesenchymal cells, plays
important roles in many processes during the progression
of malignant tumors, including proliferation, invasion
and migration [10]. Recent evidence indicates that
acquisition of EMT features in tumor cells during
chemotherapy may further promote chemoresistance [11,
12]. Moreover, related researches demonstrated that the
EMT process of cancer cells was involved in the formation
of chemoresistance during doxorubicin therapy in many
malignant tumors, including breast cancer [13], pancreatic
cancer [14] and HCC [15, 16]. Further research of the
precise regulatory mechanism of doxorubicin-induced
EMT, which still remains unclear, may provide a potential
underlying target of overcoming doxorubicin resistance in
HCC.
Salinomycin, an ionophore antibiotic, reported
to selectively kill human cancer stem cells (CSCs), is
considered as a promising drug to address the issue of
cancer chemoresistance [17, 18]. CSCs are defined as a
subpopulation of tumor cells with the capacities of selfrenewal and tumor initiation, which resist conventional
chemotherapy [19]. EMT is regarded as an important
pathway that causes cancer cells to gain stemness and
is intimately associated with tumor chemoresistance
[18]. However, to date it remains inconclusive whether
salinomycin is capable of regulating EMT in cancer
cells. Recent research demonstrates that salinomycin
downregulates the expression of EMT activators such as
zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), resulting
in suppression of the EMT in mantle cell lymphoma [20].
Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of salinomycin has been
reported on cell proliferation, migration and invasion
in endometrial CSCs in which EMT is an important
characteristic [21]. These discoveries prompted the current
study to investigate the ability of salinomycin to influence
the EMT process induced by doxorubicin in HCC cells
and to explore a new antitumor chemotherapy.
FOXO3a, an important member of the Forkhead
box O subfamily, is deemed a transcription factor at the
interface of crucial cellular processes, such as metabolism,
proliferation, survival and stress tolerance [22]. However,
there are few reports on the function of FOXO3a during
chemotherapy in HCC cells. Due to the various cellular
functions mediated by FOXO3a and the lack of research
in this field, the role of FOXO3a in EMT process of HCC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells was required to investigate. Hence, in this study,
the ability of salinomycin to enhance the cytotoxicity of
doxorubicin in HCC cells was assessed, along with the
underlying mechanisms focusing on EMT and FOXO3a. 

Results
Salinomycin sensitizes HCC cells to doxorubicin
in vitro
To investigate whether salinomycin could increase
the sensitivity of HCC cells to doxorubicin therapy,
CCK-8 assay was performed to measure cell viability
following different treatment protocols. As shown in
Figure 1, doxorubicin plus salinomycin treatment for 48
h led to a significant decrease in cell viability compared
with doxorubicin or salinomycin treatment alone in HuH7, HepG2, SNU-449 and SNU-387 cells. To demonstrate
directly whether doxorubicin and salinomycin exerted a
synergetic effect with each other in HCC cells, the half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and combination
index (CI) values were calculated based on the doseeffect curves (Fig. 1). The IC50 values for doxorubicin
at 48 h in HuH-7, HepG2, SNU-449 and SNU-387 cells
were 0.86, 0.11, 1.98 and 1.47μg/ml, respectively. When
used in combination with salinomycin, the IC50 values
for doxorubicin at 48 h were significantly lower than in
single use, changing into 0.43, 0.07, 0.36 and 0.34μg/ml,
respectively (Table 1). In addition, the CI values for these
four HCC cell lines for 48 h were 0.57, 0.68, 0.31 and
0.28, respectively, indicating synergism of doxorubicin
and salinomycin (Table 1). Meanwhile, the cytotoxicity
of different treatment protocols in HCC cells at more
time points (12 h, 24 h and 72 h) was examined (Fig. S1).
The corresponding CI values indicated additive effect of
doxorubicin and salinomycin at 12 h and 72 h. And at
the point of 24 h, salinomycin exerted a slight synergetic
effect with doxorubicin; however, the cytotoxicity of
doxorubicin did not maximize (Table S1). Hence, 48 h was
selected as a reasonable time point in the following study.

FOXO3a plays a critical role in the doxorubicininduced EMT

motile mesenchymal morphology of SNU-449 and SNU387 cells, whereas salinomycin altered them to a relatively
close-connected morphology (Fig. S2).
Furthermore, doxorubicin significantly reduced
the expression of E-cadherin and upregulated Vimentin
in HCC cells compared to the untreated control,
whereas salinomycin reversed doxorubicin-induced
expression changes of EMT-markers (Fig. 2A and
B). In addition, the expression of E-cadherin was
detected by immunofluorescence, to further confirm
the above-mentioned EMT in HCC cells regulated by
doxorubicin and salinomycin (Fig. 2C). The results of
immunofluorescent staining were consistent with the
western blotting.
Moreover, cell invasion and cell migration of
different HCC cells treated with doxorubicin, doxorubicin
plus salinomycin or salinomycin alone for 48 h were
assessed by transwell assay and wound healing assay,
respectively. As shown in Fig. S3A and B, doxorubicin
significantly enhanced invasion ability of HCC cells
compared to the untreated control, whereas salinomycin
reversed the doxorubicin-induced enhancement of cell
invasion. The migration ability of HCC cells assessed by
wound healing assay was consistent with the results of
transwell assay (Fig. S3C and D).

The role of FOXO3a in the EMT process of
HCC cells influenced by doxorubicin or salinomycin
was then investigated. The expression of FOXO3a
and phosphorated-FOXO3a was examined, as well as
the subcellular localization of FOXO3a in HCC cells
treated with doxorubicin, doxorubicin plus salinomycin
or salinomycin alone for 48 h (Fig. 3A and B). The
expression of AKT, the most important upstream regulator
of the activation of FOXO3a [23, 24], was also detected.
These results suggested that doxorubicin treatment
significantly upregulated expression of phosphorylated
FOXO3a and AKT in HCC cells, and promoted cytoplasm
translocalization of FOXO3a, whereas salinomycin
reversed the enhanced phosphorylation of FOXO3a and
AKT and accelerated nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a
(Fig. S4A and B).
Furthermore, the role of FOXO3a as the key
regulator of doxorubicin-induced EMT was investigated
by altering the expression of FOXO3a. FOXO3a-TM
plasmid and FOXO3a-siRNA were used to upregulate
and downregulate FOXO3a expression, respectively.
The efficacy of FOXO3a-TM plasmid and FOXO3asiRNA were tested in advance by measuring the relative
expression levels of FOXO3a via western blotting (Fig.

S5A and B). After upregulating or downregulating the
active FOXO3a, the expression of EMT markers in HCC
cells treated with vehicle control, doxorubicin alone or
doxorubicin plus salinomycin for 48 h was examined.
The results demonstrated that in HCC cells with FOXO3a
knocked down, salinomycin failed to reverse expression
changes of EMT-markers induced by doxorubicin (Fig.
3C). Meanwhile in HCC cells that overexpressed active
FOXO3a, whether combined with salinomycin or not,
doxorubicin could not induce significant changes in the
expression of EMT-makers (Fig. 3D). In addition, CCK-8
assay was performed to investigate whether salinomycin
enhanced cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in HCC cells with
upregulation or downregulation of active FOXO3a. In
HCC cells transfected by FOXO3a-siRNA, salinomycin
failed to enhance the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin
(Fig. S6A). In contrast, in HCC cells transfected by
FOXO3a-TM plasmid, doxorubicin alone exerted similar
cytotoxicity as when combined with salinomycin (Fig.
S6B). The CI values in different HCC cells were also
calculated based on the dose-effect curves in Fig.S6A and
S6B. All the CI values were greater than 0.9, indicating an
additive effect of doxorubicin and salinomycin (Tables 2
and 3).

Recent studies have demonstrated that FOXO3a
competed with T-cell factor (TCF) for binding to
β-catenin, an important signaling molecule in the
canonical Wnt pathway, in colon carcinoma cells [25].
Whether FOXO3a regulating doxorubicin-induced EMT
in HCC via changing the interaction of β-catenin/TCF4
complex, which was involved in the EMT process of
various cancers [26, 27], was investigated in the following
study.

The β-catenin/TCF complex is absolutely essential
to the doxorubicin-induced EMT
To examine the role of the β-catenin/TCF complex
in doxorubicin-induced EMT, the expression of β-catenin,
EMT-markers and interaction of TCF4 with β-catenin in
HCC cells treated with doxorubicin in the presence or
absence of PKF 118-310, a small-molecule antagonist
of the β-catenin/TCF4 complex [28], was assessed. In
addition, the mRNA expression levels of TCF4-dependent
genes, such as ZEB1 [29], CyclinD1 and c-Myc [30, 31]
were detected by RT-PCR. As shown in Figs. 4A and
S7A, increased expression of β-catenin and β-catenin/

TCF4 complex was observed in mesenchymal cells like
SNU-449 and SNU-387, compared to epithelial cells.
As expected, doxorubicin increased the β-catenin/TCF4
interaction in HCC cells, whereas PKF 118-310 disrupted
the β-catenin/TCF complex. Furthermore, β-catenin/TCF
complex target genes (ZEB1, CyclinD1 and c-Myc,) which
were increased by doxorubicin, were downregulated
following the disruption of β-catenin/TCF4 interaction in
HCC cells (Fig. 4B). The doxorubicin-induced expression
changes of E-cadherin and Vimentin in HCC cells could
also be reversed by PKF 118-310 (Fig. 4C). In addition,
CCK-8 assay was performed to detect whether the
acquired-resistance of doxorubicin in HCC cells was
improved after disrupting the β-catenin/TCF complex
by PKF 118-310. As shown in Figure 4D, combined
chemotherapy for 48 h led to a significant decrease in cell
viability compared with doxorubicin alone. The calculated
CI values of HuH-7, HepG2, SNU-449 and SNU-387,
were 0.77, 0.87, 0.65 and 0.44, respectively, indicating
synergism of doxorubicin and β-catenin/TCF4 complex
antagonist (Table 4).

the ability of FOXO3a to affect the interaction of the
β-catenin/TCF complex and the β-catenin/TCF target
genes was further investigated. Binding of FOXO3a
and TCF4 to β-catenin in HCC cells transfected with
FOXO3a-siRNA or FOXO3a-WT plasmid was assessed,
and mRNA expression levels of β-catenin/TCF target
genes were measured. Results showed that upregulation of
FOXO3a led to increased β-catenin/FOXO3a interaction,
decreased β-catenin/TCF4 interaction and reduction
of mRNA expression of TCF4 target genes, meanwhile
downregulation of FOXO3a led to the opposite changes
(Figs. 5A, B and S7B). In addition, the binding of TCF4
to β-catenin in HCC cells treated with doxorubicin was
assessed in the presence or absence of salinomycin for
48 h, and mRNA expression levels from β-catenin/TCF
target genes were measured. As expected, doxorubicin
caused increased β-catenin/TCF4 interaction and enhanced
expression of TCF4 target genes, whereas salinomycin
reversed these changes (Figs. 5C, D and S7C). Taken
together these data suggest that FOXO3a and TCF4
compete for binding to β-catenin, and FOXO3a inhibits
the transcription of TCF4-dependent genes which were
reported relative with EMT in HCC cells.

FOXO3a reduces binding of β-catenin to TCF and
inhibits β-catenin/TCF target genes in HCC cells

in doxorubicin-induced EMT was confirmed above,

Salinomycin enhances the curative efficacy of
doxorubicin for HCC in vivo

effects of traditional monotherapeutic drugs in clinic
like doxorubicin are not satisfactory. Recent reports
demonstrated that certain agents such as selenocystine
[6], 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 [7], and MK-2206 [32], exert
synergetic anticancer effects with doxorubicin and may
potentially improve doxorubicin-based chemotherapeutic
efficacy in HCC treatment. This study demonstrated the
synergism of salinomycin with doxorubicin for HCC
cells and the underlying mechanism focused on EMT and
FOXO3a.
Salinomycin, a traditional anticoccidial drug, has
recently been shown to possess anticancer and anti-CSC
effects, as well as the capacity to overcome multi-drug
resistance [17-19]. Mechanisms to explain the specificity
of salinomycin on CSCs and multidrug resistant cancer
cells remain unclear. Gupta et al. observed the appearance
of CSC like cells when EMT transformation proceeded
in HMLER breast cancer cells [18]. This discovery
demonstrated that EMT may be a vital pathway for
salinomycin effects in CSCs. In fact, there have been
few studies reported to investigate the relationship
between salinomycin and EMT to date. In the current
study, doxorubicin was observed to significantly reduce
expression of E-cadherin and upregulate Vimentin in
HCC cells, whereas salinomycin reversed doxorubicininduced expression changes of EMT-markers, indicating

To investigate the in vivo effects of doxorubicin and
salinomycin combined therapy for HCC, we established
xenograft models via subcutaneous injection of HuH-7
cells into nude mice and monitored tumor growth under
different treatments every other day. We found that
intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin or salinomycin
alone for two weeks inhibited the growth of tumors, while
combined treatment resulted in a significantly increased
inhibition of tumor-growth (Fig. 6A and B). Following
two weeks of chemotherapy, the mice were euthanized
and the tumors were dissected and weighed. Tumor
regression rates for different treatments were calculated,
and salinomycin was found to significantly enhance the
curative efficacy of doxorubicin for HCC in vivo as shown
in Fig. 6C and D.

Discussion
Chemotherapy is an important component of
postoperative or preoperative therapy for HCC, and
may be the only approach for patients suffering from
intermediate or advanced HCC. However, the curative

salinomycin as an EMT suppressor.
As an important signaling molecule in crucial
cellular processes, FOXO3a is involved in metabolism,
protein homeostasis, damage repair, stress resistance and
cell fate decisions [22]. It has been reported that FOXO3a
activity is suppressed in drug-resistant cancer cells [33,
34], whereas acquired chemoresistance is intimately
associated with EMT in multiple tumors [11, 12].
However, the precise role of FOXO3a in the EMT process
of cancer cells still remains unclear. Ni et al. recently
discovered that FOXO3a inactivation leads to decreased
expression of snail family zinc finger 1 (SNAIL1), an
E-cadherin repressor, resulting in EMT in renal clear cell
carcinoma [35]. Activated FOXO3a has also been shown
to reverse the EMT by activating ERα signaling in breast
cancer cells [36]. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK
suppresses EMT by modulating the Akt-MDM2-Foxo3
signaling axis in breast and prostate cancer cells [37].
However, the relationship between FOXO3a and EMT in
HCC cells is not clear. Interestingly, FOXO3a activation
was observed to be downregulated in doxorubicin-treated

HCC cells in the current study, and salinomycin was found
to enhance cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in HCC cells by
preventing the EMT process via the activation of FOXO3a.
Knockdown of FOXO3a resulted in salinomycin failing to
reverse the EMT and overexpression of active FOXO3a
caused doxorubicin to lose the capacity of inducing EMT
in HCC cells. These results indicated that activation of
FOXO3a by salinomycin is required to prevent the EMT
process of HCC cells in doxorubicin treatment.
The transcriptional activity of FOXO3a is mainly
regulated through post-translational modifications (PTMs)
and nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttle, meanwhile PI3K/
AKT pathway-regulated phosphorylation of FOXO3a is
the most important type of PTMs to regulate FOXO3a
subcellular localization [23, 24]. In this study, doxorubicin
treatment was observed to induce upregulation of
expression of activated AKT and led to retention of
FOXO3a in the cytoplasm, whereas salinomycin reversed
these changes. Although phosphorylation modification is
the most important PTMs, nucleus/cytoplasm shuttling of
FOXO3a is still affected by other mechanisms and further

experiments are required to clarify the precise mechanism
of regulation of activity of FOXO3a in HCC cells.
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a key
pathway in multiple aspects of cell processes, including
cell proliferation, differentiation and morphogenesis
[38]. The aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
contributes to EMT via extremely complex mechanisms
resulting in carcinogenesis and progression of multiple
tumors [26, 27]. In the canonical Wnt pathway, Wnt
ligands bind to the Frizzled/LRP co-receptor complex
leading to the stabilization and nuclear translocation
of β-catenin, a powerful transactivator of LEF/TCF
transcription factors, which regulate important downstream
target genes [38]. The β-catenin/TCF4 complex, a critical
oncogenous complex, binds directly to the ZEB1 promoter
and activates its transcription, thereby leading to EMT in
colorectal cancer [29]. The results from the current study
revealed that in HCC cells the β-catenin/TCF4 complex
played critical roles in doxorubicin-induced EMT, and
disruption of the β-catenin/TCF complex by PKF 118310 could prevent the EMT process. As a conventional
transcriptional activator of multiple genes, FOXO3a
protein also co-operates with other transcription factors
and modulates downstream effectors [39-41]. Diana et al.
reported that FOXO3a competed with TCF for binding
to β-catenin, thereby inhibiting TCF transcriptional
activity and suppressing endogenous TCF target genes
in colon carcinoma cells [25]. In HCC cells, β-catenin
was also observed switching from TCF4 to FoxO3a,
which contributed to the IFN-a2b-mediated effects on
cellular proliferation and apoptosis [42]. The results of the
current study demonstrate that along with the activation
of FOXO3a by salinomycin treatment or consistent
activation of FOXO3a by transfected with FOXO3aTM in HCC cells, the association of the β-catenin/TCF4
complex was decreased and TCF4 target genes such as
ZEB1, c-Myc, CyclinD1 were inhibited, indicating that
FOXO3a functions as an inhibitor of the classical Wnt
signaling pathway.
In summary, this study identified a new doxorubicinbased antitumor chemotherapy which may improve
curative efficacy of chemotherapy for intermediate
or advanced HCC. In addition, this study provides a
potential strategy that drugs targeting FOXO3a and
related cell pathway molecules will benefit for anti-cancer
chemotherapy. However, the mechanism of FOXO3a
inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Fig. S8)
is only a small part of the complex network of cytokines
and growth factors involved, therefore further research
into FOXO3a is required.

Cell lines and cultures
Human hepatocarcinoma cell lines (HuH-7, HepG2,
SNU-449, SNU-387) were purchased from the Shanghai
Institute for Biological Science (Shanghai, China). HepG2
and HuH-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Minimal
Essential Medium (DMEM; Gibco; Carlsbad, CA, USA)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 100
U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. SNU-449
and SNU-387 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2
and 95% air.

Drugs and antibodies
Salinomycin, doxorubicin and PKF 118-310
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA). Total-FOXO3a (t-FOXO3a), phospho-FOXO3a
(Thr32; p-FOXO3a), total-AKT (t-AKT), phosphoAKT (Ser473; p-AKT), E-cadherin, Vimentin, β-catenin
and TCF4 primary antibodies for western blotting,
immunoprecipitation or immunofluorescence were
obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA).
GAPDH primary antibodies were obtained from Kangchen
Biotechnology (Sichuan, China). The HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies, goat-anti-mouse second antibody

Transfection of FOXO3a overexpression plasmid

[Drug] is the concentration (μg/ml or μM) of doxorubicin,
salinomycin or PKF 118-310.

FOXO3a overexpression plasmid, FOXO3aTM, in which the three AKT phosphorylation sites are
mutated encoding constitutively active FOXO3a protein,
was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA).
HCC Cells were transfected with negative control
vectors (NC-Vectors) or FOXO3a-TM plasmid using
Lipofectamine-2000 for 6h and all experiments were
performed 72 h after transfection. The transfection efficacy
of FOXO3a-siRNA and FOXO3a-TM plasmid were
assessed by examining the relative FOXO3a expression
levels by western blotting.

Western blot assay
HCC cell lysates were washed twice in ice-cold
PBS and resuspended in 100μl cell lysis buffer (Cell
Signaling; Danvers, MA, USA) per treatment. The protein
concentrations were quantified using the BCA Protein
assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.; Rockford, IL,
USA). Prepared protein lysates were mixed with NuPage
loading buffer (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA), denatured
by boiling for 10 minutes, separated using 10% SDSPAGE gels, and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes (Millipore; Billerica, MA, USA).
After blocking with sealed liquid for 2 h, membranes
were incubated with primary anti-t-FOXO3a, anti-pFOXO3a (Thr32), anti-t-AKT, anti-p-AKT (Ser473), antiE-cadherin, anti-Vimentin, anti-GAPDH antibodies at 4°C
overnight. The membranes were washed three times with
tris buffered saline with 1% Tween 20 (TBS/T), incubated
with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
for 2 h at room temperature. Protein bands were developed
by chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare; Piscataway, NJ,
USA) and visualized using an autoradiography kit (Kodak;
Rochester, NY, USA). Band densities were estimated
using Image Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Inc.; Bethesda,
MD, USA), while relative protein expression levels were
normalized to GAPDH.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was measured using Cell Counting
Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo; Kumamoto, Japan) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. HCC cells were plated
into 96-well plates (3000 cells/well; 100μl media).
Following overnight cultured, the media was removed
and replaced with conditioned media containing different
concentrations of doxorubicin (0, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25,
0.5, 1μg/ml), salinomycin (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40μM) or
PKF 118-310 (0, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1μM). The
cells were cultured for 48 h, then 10μl CCK-8 solution
was added per well and the plates were incubated for 3 h.
Absorbance was then measured at 450 nm using a MRX II
microplate reader (Dynex, Chantilly, VA, USA). Relative
cell viability was determined as a percentage of untreated
control HCC cells.

Transwell assay

Combination analysis

Invasion activity of cells in vitro was examined by
their ability to pass through a gel matrix (Matrigel; BD;
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). In brief, 6.5 mm diameter
polycarbonate filters (8 μm pore) of the transwell
chambers (Corning; NY, USA) for use in 24-well plates
were coated with 65 ml of working matrigel solution (1:5
diluted with FBS-free DMEM) and were placed at 37°C
for at least 0.5 h to dry. Cells were subjected to different
treatments as indicated and were then seeded at a density
of 2 × 105 per chamber, and FBS-free DMEM was added
into the upper compartments of the chambers. Meanwhile,
the lower compartments of the chamber were filled with
DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 48 h, non-invasive
cells on the upper surface of the filters were removed
completely by wiping the filter surface with cotton swabs.
Viable invasive cells adhering to the lower surface of the
filter were fixed using 4% polyphosphate formaldehyde
(Beyotime; Shanghai, China). The invaded cells were
stained using crystal violet (Beyotime; Shanghai, China).
The number of stained cells in five 100× vision fields of
each treatment was counted. Average cell numbers of
these five fields were calculated and then normalized to
control. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and

Chou and Talalay introduced combination index
(CI) for quantification of synergism or antagonism of
two drugs in 1983. CI = (D)1/(Dx)1+(D)2/(Dx)2. Where CI
<1, =1, and>1 indicate synergism, additive effect, and
antagonism, respectively. In the denominator, (Dx)1 is
for D1 “alone” that inhibits a system x%, and (Dx)2 is for
D2 “alone” that inhibits a system x%. In the numerators,
(D)1+(D)2 “in combination” also inhibit x%. The goal is
to achieve the maximal effect of drugs tested on HCC
cells, therefore we specified 50 for this value of “x”: CI
= (IC50)C1/(IC50)S or P+(IC50)C2/(IC50)D. Where CI ≤0.9,
>0.9 and <1.1, ≥1.1 indicate synergism, additive effect,
and antagonism, respectively [43]. In the denominator,
(IC50)S or P is for salinomycin or PKF 118-310 “alone” that
inhibits a system by 50%, and (IC50)D is for doxorubicin
“alone” that inhibits a system by 50%. In the numerators,
(IC50)C1+(IC50)C2 “in combination” also inhibit by 50%. In
addition, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
was determined by f﻿﻿itting data to the equation: V% = 100/
(1+10[Drug]log IC50), where V% is the percentage viability and

Wound healing assay

Total RNA was isolated from HuH-7,
HepG2,SNU-449 and SNU-387 cells treated for 48 h using
Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA), and then
reverse transcribed using Prime Script Reagent RT Kit
(Takara Biotechnology Co.; Dalian, China) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. The PCR-primers for FOXO3a,
ZEB1, CyclinD1 and v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral

reverse:
5-CGCAGTAGAAATACGGCTGCAC-3).
RT-PCR was performed using ABI 7900 Prism HT
(Applied Biosystems Inc.; Shanghai, China) followed
by melting curve analysis. FOXO3a, ZEB1, CyclinD1
and c-Myc mRNA expression was normalized to β-actin
(forward: 5-TGGCACC
CAGCACAATGAA-3;
reverse:
5-CTAAGTCATAGTCCGCCTAGAAGCA-3).

Cells were subjected to different treatments as
indicated and were then seeded in 6-well plates. After
reaching 90% confluence, the cell monolayers were
wounded with sterile plastic tips and were cultured in
FBS-free DMEM. Cell migration was observed 24 h later
by microscopy (Nikon; Tokyo, Japan), and the wound area
was assessed by using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (IPP;
Media Cybernetics; Acton, MA), normalized wound area
was calculated by (wound area of 24 h / wound area of 0
h), which was then normalized to control.

Immunofluorescence assay
HCC cells were plated into glass bottom cell
culture dishes (10, 000 cells/dish), allowed to adhere
overnight and then treated in conditioned media for 48
h. HCC cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde before
being permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min.
Following blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin for
1h at room temperature, HCC cells were incubated with
anti-E-cadherin or anti-FOXO3a primary antibody at 4°C
overnight. After washing three times in ice-cold PBS for
5 minutes, the cells were incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa
Fluor 488 secondary antibody at 4°C for 2 h, followed
by incubation in PI for 5 min at room temperature for
nuclear counterstain. Immunofluorescent imaging was
performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope
(Leica; Wetzlar, Germany). The subcellular localization
of FOXO3a was quantified by calculating the percentage
of nuclear localized FOXO3a of 100 cells from five
randomly selected views in each sample.

Subcutaneous mouse xenograft of HuH-7 cells
Animal research was performed in compliance
with the Guide for the Care and Use of the Animal
Ethics Committee of Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, PR
China). Male nude mice (Shanghai Experiment Animal
Centre; Shanghai, China), 3-4 weeks old and weighing
15-20 g, were used in the study, raised under pathogenfree conditions with irradiated fodder. Twenty-four nude
mice were injected and randomly subdivided into four
groups. Prepared HuH-7 cells (1×106) resuspended in
100μl PBS were injected subcutaneously into the right
axillary fossa of each mouse. Tumor length (L) and width
(W) were measured with sliding caliper every other day,
and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula
(L×W2)/2 [44]. Drug treatment was initiated when
tumor volumes reached 50-100 mm3. Four subgroups
underwent different treatments: three experimental
groups including doxorubicin (4 mg/kg), salinomycin
(4 mg/kg) and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) combined with
salinomycin (4 mg/kg), as well as one vehicle-treated
control group (equal volume of diluents). Drugs were
delivered intraperitoneally every 2 days for 2 weeks. After

Co-immunoprecipitation assay
Prepared HCC cell lysates were incubated with
anti-β-catenin primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The
immune complex was then precipitated at 4°C for 2 h
by pre-washed Protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; Dallas, Texas, USA). The proteins bound
to β-catenin primary antibodies and Protein A-Sepharose
beads were washed, separated using 10% SDS-PAGE
Gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and then incubated
with anti-FOXO3a or anti-TCF4 primary antibody and
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoreactive
bands were analyzed as western blots.
