BACKGROUND. Microsatellite studies in histologic types B3 and C thymic neoplasia detected gains on chromosome 17q, which contains the Her-2/neu and its
juxtaposed topoisomerase 2a (T2a) genes. The study aimed to evaluate their
impact on tumor biology and survival of advanced thymic neoplasia patients.

METHODS. From 1991 to 2005, 36 consecutive stage IV thymic carcinoma patients
were treated, 18 men and 18 women, aged 11 to 84 years. There were 22 thymic
carcinoma, 13 type B3, and 1 type B2 thymoma. Patients received treatment consisting of surgical resection, combination chemotherapy with the CAP (cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, cisplatin) regimen, or radiation therapy potentiated
by high-dose weekly 5-fluorouracil infusion. Permutations of these 3 treatment
modalities were prescribed as necessary.

RESULTS. T2a gene amplification was detected in 4 of 14 thymic carcinoma and
1 of 15 type B3 thymoma. Three thymic carcinoma patients had Her-2/neu
coamplification and these 3 patients had rapidly growing tumor and extensive
disease at initial diagnosis. CAP was prescribed in 28 patients and 20 patients

nvasive thymomas and thymic carcinomas are relatively uncommon tumors: 80 to 120 such patients are reported annually in Taiwan, with a population of 23 million people.1 In 1999 the World
Health Organization classified thymic epithelial tumors (TET) histologically into types A, AB, B1, B2, B3, exhibiting organotypic
thymus-like architectural features, and type C thymoma, which encompasses all histologic carcinomas growing in the anatomical thymus.2–4 The 2004 update further accommodates identified genetic
alterations in TETs: the terminology ‘‘type C’’ has been replaced by
‘‘thymic carcinoma,’’ covering thymic carcinoids, neuroendocrine
tumors, and a few new entities.3,4
Masaoka staging is the most significant determinant of survival
for patients with TETs. In 273 Japanese TETs, stages I, II, III, IVa,
and IVb patients numbered 124, 70, 63, 10, and 6 patients, respectively, with corresponding 20-year survival rates of 89%, 91%, 49%,

0%, and 0%.5 In 200 Chinese TET patients, 13 stage
IV patients attained a median survival of under
2 years because they received only surgical resection.6 In 228 German TET patients, 25 stage IV
patients had a median survival of 7 years, attributed
to the addition of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.7
The second most important determinant for survival
is histology. Types A, AB, and B1 enjoy prolonged recurrence-free survival,7 whereas the 5-year survival
rates were 59% and 36%, respectively, for types B2
and B3 Japanese TET patients,5 and 70% and 48%,
respectively, for types B3 and C Chinese TET patients.6 Stage IV cases make up approximately 8% (54
of 701) of reported TET patients.5–7
Comparative genomic hybridization8 studies
have ascertained chromosome loss from 6q25 as an
early event that can be found in 10.8%, 12.6%, 20%
to 26%, and 35% of types A, AB, B2/3, and C thymomas, respectively.4,8,9 In thymic carcinomas, chromosome gains on 1q, 17q, and 18 have been
documented in 56%, 33%, and 33% of cases, respectively.8 Microsatellite (site-specific localization) analysis can identify amplifications or deletions of a gene
to the order of tens of base pairs: specific markers
were selected to detect genetic changes at target sites
on chromosome loci 3p, 4q, 5q, 6q, 7p, 8q, 9p, 10q,
11, 12q, 13q, 14q, 15q, 16, 17p, 18q, and 19q; it
should be noted that 17q was omitted from this
study.2 Candidate genes identified include the IGF2R,
MAP3K5, ZAC genes on 6q25, APC gene on 5q21, p53
gene on 17p13.1, retinoblastoma gene on 13q14, and
the gene for tumor necrosis factor a, CDKN1A, and
MHC on 6q21.2 Chromosome 17q21 happens to be
the location of Her-2/neu and its juxtaposed
topoisomerase2a (T2a) oncogene.10 Her-2/neu amplification adversely modifies the tumor biology and
behavior of a tumor by increasing its metastatic
potential and drug resistance.11 The T2a gene codes
for production of the T2a enzyme, which is the cellular target for anthracyclines and epidophyllotoxins.12
In the Her-2/neu-amplified breast cancer cell line
UACC812, concurrent amplification of the T2a gene
with overexpression of the T2a protein makes it exquisitely sensitive to doxorubicin (IC50 <4 ng/mL),
whereas the MDA-MB-361 cell line with constitutive deletion of the T2a gene and low expression of the T2a
protein is very resistant (IC50 >24 ng/mL).10 Concurrent
amplification of the 2 genes significantly influence the
efficacy of T2a targeting drugs and trastuzumab.10–14
A review of chemotherapeutic regimens used in
TETs over the years repeatedly confirmed the high
efficacy of a CAP (cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin,
and cisplatin)-based regimen. Response rates from
50% to 90% have been reported in 185 patients (stage

503

I-IV), median time to progression ranging from 11 to
72 months.15–24 Reports on the efficacy of other
drugs, such as cisplatin monotherapy25 and ifosfamide,26,27 are limited. More recently, agents such as
octreotide28 and imatinib,29 which respectively target
the type II somatostatin receptor and mutant c-kit
receptor, have achieved success in highly selected
patients.
At the Taipei-Veterans’ General Hospital, patients
with thymic neoplasia receive multimodal therapy
consisting of surgical resection, radiotherapy potentiated by 5-fluorouracil (5FU), or combination
chemotherapy with the CAP regimen, the most consistently efficacious regimen from our literature
search. None or all of the 3 treatment modalities may
be prescribed. 5FU is not conventionally prescribed
for TETs, although it has proven efficacy in this disease.30 5FU can also potentiate radiotherapy.31
The aim of this study was to ascertain the role
played by the Her-2/neu and T2a oncogenes in chromosome 17q gains of thymic neoplasia, its impact
on tumor biology, possible and likely relation between T2a and response to the CAP regimen, and
survival. Retrospective evaluation of Her-2/neu and
T2a gene amplification by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) was performed followed by determination of protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for T2a protein; excision repair
cross-complementing protein-1 (ERCC-1) overexpression portends resistance to platinum drugs32; and
thymidylate synthase (TS) overexpression portends
resistance to 5FU.33

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
From 1991 to 2005, 36 (Unique Patient Number
[UPN] 1–36) stage IV patients (Table 1) were documented and treated. Patient management was conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration and
existing rules for good clinical practice and informed
consent was signed before all therapeutic manipulations. Specimen for marker studies were retrieved
retrospectively, and was available in at most 29 cases
operated on in our institution. Markers evaluated
include Her-2/neu FISH (21 cases), T2a FISH (29
cases), T2a IHC (26 cases), TS (26 cases), and ERCC-1
(25 cases).
Chemotherapy administered was CAP (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, Adriamycin 50 mg/m2, and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 for 3 weeks), and the weekly (given
alone) or biweekly (concurrently with radiotherapy)
high dose 5FU-leucovorin (HDFL) (5-fluorouracil 2600

dilution, the TS Ab-1 at 1:40 dilution, and the ERCC1 Ab-2 at 1:100 dilution, all from Lab Vision (Fremont, CA). Briefly, 4–5-mm-thick paraffin sections
were cut and plated on organosilane-coated slides,
baked overnight, and deparaffinized, with application
of the chosen primary antibody overnight at 48C,
using the DAKO LSAB-2 system (DakoCytomation,
Glostrup, Denmark) for detection, then counterstained for visualization. A hundred cells were
counted in a representative area of the slide and a
positive report required 10% nuclei to be stained
for T2a (MDA-MB361, a T2a deleted cell line, was
the negative control; positive control was SKBR3, T2a
normal cell line). TS, a predominantly cytoplasmic
stain, where only positive or negative was reported,
and the MCF-7 cell line were used as a positive control.36 ERCC-1 utilization, a known archival breast

cancer specimen, was used as positive and negative
controls.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were done using GraphPad PRISM.
4.05 (San Diego, CA). Interaction between the different
molecular markers and response to CAP therapy was
done with the Fisher exact test in a univariate analysis.
A multivariate regression analysis was conducted according to the Cox proportional hazard model using
SPSS for Windows, v. 11.5.0 (Chicago, IL). The KaplanMeier method was used to calculate survival and a logrank test to evaluate its statistical significance. A P-value
of less than .05 was considered significant.

RESULTS
From 1991 to 2005, 36 stage IV (22 IVa, 13 IVb) TET
patients were treated, ranging in age from 11 to 84

men (Table 1). The patients presented with a wide
range of autoimmune diseases, including 6 myasthenia gravis, 2 autoimmune thyroiditis, 2 pure red cell
aplasia, 1 nephrotic syndrome, and 1 systemic lupus
erythematosis. UPN 19 was a hepatitis C carrier and
liver function derangement was detected after 3
courses of CAP; treatment was terminated before
response documentation. UPN 11 achieved CR with
resolution of metastatic bone disease, but while still
in remission he died from fulminant reactivation
hepatitis B.
Initial pathology specimens were obtained through
R1 (maximal resection with only microscopic disease
remaining) or R2 resection (maximal resection with
macroscopic residual disease) in 8 (all B2/B3 thymoma) and 2 (1B3 thymoma, 1 thymic carcinoma)
patients, respectively; 22 patients received only a biopsy and 4 patients had inadequate specimen for
study (Table 1). Histologically, there were 1 B2, 14 B3,
and 20 thymic carcinomas.
A median of 4 courses (2–6 courses) of CAP
chemotherapy was administered to 28 patients.
There were 3 CR and 17 PR out of a total of 28

toxicity was limited to grade 4 nausea and vomiting
in 1 patient only, and there were no mortalities.
HDFL was given without radiotherapy in 21 patients and patients received up to 26 weeks of therapy.
There was 1 complete (UPN 7) and 2 partial remissions,
giving a response rate of 14.3% (95% CI ¼ 4.1% to
35.5%). UPN 7, a type B3 thymoma patient with extensive pleural involvement, achieved CR on the high-dose
5FU/leucovorin (HDFL) regimen alone, with a sustained
progression-free survival of 10 years (Table 1).
The median follow-up time for 36 patients was
4 years (range, 1.5–15 years), and median survival has
not yet been reached at 4.5 years. In Table 2 the
most significant favorable prognostic factor influencing survival was resectability (P ¼ .001), also type
B2/3 histological type (P ¼ .0039), and absence of
Her-2/neu gene amplification (P ¼ .0081). A multivariate analysis revealed that tumor resection was the
only significant factor associated with prolonged survival (P ¼ .013).
T2a gene (located at chromosome 17q21-22)
amplification was clearly documented in 5 of 29
patients, with concurrent amplification of the Her-2/
neu gene (at chromosome 17q11.2-q12) in 3 patients

(Fig. 1). Only UPN 1 had a tumor specimen obtained
after an R1 resection. Biopsy specimens were obtained
from the other 4 patients because of advanced bone
(UPN 2), liver (UPN 3) metastases, and large vessel
encasement (UPN 4,5). T2a protein overexpression
was detected in 84.6% (22 of 26) of available specimens;
15.4% (4 of 26) showed almost no detectable T2a
protein (Table 1, Fig. 1). TS was overexpressed in 73%
(19 of 26) of specimens, and not detectable in 7 specimens. ERCC1 was overexpressed in 28% (7 of 25) of
specimens.
In-depth analysis of markers predicting response
to the CAP regimen showed that T2a protein overexpression is a very significant predictor of response to
CAP (P ¼ .001 in Table 3), whereas amplification of
the Her-2/neu or T2a gene and expression of the
ERCC1 or TS protein bore no correlation to CAP
response (Table 3). However, response to CAP did
not significantly improve survival (P ¼ .1739 in Table
2). Absence of TS expression does not predict
response to the HDFL regimen (P ¼ .5439 in Table 3),
nor can any of the other markers (data not shown).
In addition, response to HDFL did not improve survival (P ¼ .1197 in Table 2).

DISCUSSION
Elucidation of chronological genetic events involved
in the initiation, progression, prognostication, and
therapeutic manipulation of TETs has been fascinating. This study included 36 stage IV patients, making
it 1 of the largest series of stage IV patients reported
in the literature. Low amplification of the Her-2/neu
gene (2–2.5-fold) was found in 3 thymic carcinoma
patients who all had rapidly growing, large tumor
loads, and poor performance status at diagnosis,
making them reluctant to consent to any invasive
diagnostic procedure, which could potentially make
this subset of Her-2/neu amplified patients underrepresented in archival specimens. UPN 3 died a year
after diagnosis from disease progression, and the
other 2 patients (UPN 2, 4) received trastuzumab
therapy. To our surprise, 5 patients, including
2 patients without Her 2 amplification, had T2a gene
amplification (3–4-fold), occurring in 1 of 15 type B3
thymoma and 4 of 14 thymic carcinoma. Frequency
of T2a gene amplification agrees with CGH studies
reporting gains at 17q in 1 of 17 type B3, and 3 of 10
thymic carcinomas,8 microsatellite studies omitted
17q,37 but we firmly believe the Her-2/neu and T2a
genes to be the candidate genes at this site.
Good response was attained in all 4 of the T2a
amplified patients who received CAP therapy, but the
responses were not durable: progression in bone

507

(UPN 2) and liver (UPN 3) recurred 12 and 6 months
after completion of CAP therapy, respectively. Survival analysis of the CALGB 8541 trial demonstrated
that node-positive Her-2 amplified breast cancer
patients benefited from a higher adjuvant Adriamycin dose of 60 mg/m2,13 which should also be considered for our Her-2 and T2a amplified patients.
The addition of trastuzumab incurs a survival advantage in Her-2/neu amplified breast cancer patients in
the neoadjuvant,38 adjuvant,14 and metastatic39 settings, and may have potential benefit for Her-2/neu
amplified thymic carcinoma patients in similar scenarios.
Many classes of protein markers have been studied in thymic epithelial tumors: bcl-2 was found to
be associated with advanced disease,40 strong p53
expression portends unresectability,40,41 Her-2/neu
and the apoptosis markers Bcl-X, p21, and cyclin D1
were seldom found in archival specimens,41 EGFR
protein overexpression was common, but no mutations or deletions have been reported.42 None of
these markers would be considered useful in the
selection of appropriate chemotherapy, but trastuzumab and Adriamycin have both been proven in
Phase III randomized clinical trials to benefit breast
cancer patients with Her-2/neu and T2a amplification, respectively.
With the documentation of T2a and Her-2/neu
gene amplification, the next logical step was to evaluate protein markers relevant to CAP and HDFL
response in this group of patients. All 16 patients
(except UPN 18 with hepatitis) with overexpression
of the T2a protein responded to CAP, and 4 patients
with no detectable T2a protein progressed on treatment (P ¼ .001). No other marker evaluated showed
any correlation to CAP response (Table 3). A
response rate around 70% to CAP is comparable to
literature reports of 50% to 92%, even though the
response data should be interpreted with caution
because this was not a prospective clinical trial. Median survival has not been reached at 4.5 years; this
is an improvement on a previous report of 2 years
for untreated patients.6 Neoadjuvant CAP can convert an inoperable tumor to operable; with appropriate postoperative radiotherapy, 4 patients have
remained disease-free. UPN 17 and 27 both
responded to single-agent Adriamycin alone, so that
it is highly likely that Adriamycin plays a pivotal role
in the CAP regimen for treatment of patients with
thymic neoplasia.
HDFL attained a 27% response rate, overexpression of TS was detected in 19 of 26 specimens, but
could not be correlated to HDFL response. TS and
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase mRNA levels have

508

been confirmed to be high in neoplastic compared
with normal thymic tissues,43 so that 5FU is probably
not efficacious in most TET patients and its prescription requires careful patient selection.
In conclusion, coamplification of the Her-2/neu/
T2a genes occurs in TETs. This agrees with previous
reports of chromosome gains on 17q in the advanced
stages of TETs.44 Coamplification of the 2 oncogenes
confers a rapidly growing phenotype, with a propensity for distant metastases or inoperable local disease
at initial diagnosis. The CAP regimen is very effective
in tumor control, with potential to convert an inoperable tumor to become operable, and resectability is
the most important factor for survival. Even without
T2a gene amplification, overexpression of the T2a
protein can predict response to the CAP regimen,
and, importantly, low or absent expression of the
T2a protein should act as an early warning to change
from a CAP regimen to an alternative, more effective
and less cardiotoxic regimen if the patient is not
improving.
