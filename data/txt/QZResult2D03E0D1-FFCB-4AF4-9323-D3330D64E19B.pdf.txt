ABSTRACT
The SGK1 kinase is pivotal in signal transduction pathways operating in cell
transformation and tumor progression. Here, we characterize in depth a novel potent
and selective pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-based SGK1 inhibitor. This compound, named
SI113, active in vitro in the sub-micromolar range, inhibits SGK1-dependent signaling
in cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We recently showed that SI113
slows down tumor growth and induces cell death in colon carcinoma cells, when
used in monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel. We now demonstrate for the
first time that SI113 inhibits tumour growth in hepatocarcinoma models in vitro and
in vivo. SI113-dependent tumor inhibition is dose- and time-dependent. In vitro and
in vivo SI113-dependent SGK1 inhibition determined a dramatic increase in apotosis/
necrosis, inhibited cell proliferation and altered the cell cycle profile of treated
cells. Proteome-wide biochemical studies confirmed that SI113 down-regulates the
abundance of proteins downstream of SGK1 with established roles in neoplastic
transformation, e.g. MDM2, NDRG1 and RAN network members. Consistent with
knock-down and over-expressing cellular models for SGK1, SI113 potentiated and
synergized with radiotherapy in tumor killing. No short-term toxicity was observed in
treated animals during in vivo SI113 administration. These data show that direct SGK1
inhibition can be effective in hepatic cancer therapy, either alone or in combination
with radiotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

We recently identified a small molecule, SI113, that
is particularly effective in inhibiting SGK1 kinase activity,
while being much less effective on AKT1, ABL and SRC
activities [31, 32]. SI113 was able to induce cell death
in various malignant cell lines, including MCF7 breast
carcinoma, A-172 malignant glioma and RKO colon
carcinoma and synergized with paclitaxel in induction of
apoptosis [31]. We now present in vitro data obtained in
HepG2 and HuH-7 cell lines, as well as in vivo data from
HCC xenografts in NOD/SCID mice, indicating that SI113
inhibits liver cancer cell proliferation, induces apoptosis
and necrosis and potentiates the effects of radiotherapy,
mimicking some of the effects of SGK1 knock-down.
Based on the apparent lack of toxicity and the consistent
effectiveness of SI113 in mice, this molecule is of potential
value in the treatment of human HCC, either alone or in
combination with radiotherapy.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health
problem, accounting for more than 782,000 new cases per
year worldwide [1,2].The disease is generally diagnosed
at advanced stages and lacks effective treatment [3].
Therefore, it is important to elucidate molecular
mechanisms that can be used to identify pharmacological
targets for the treatment of HCC [4]. Increasing efforts
have been recently devoted to the development of
radiotherapy-based approaches for conservative or rescue
treatment of HCC [5]. Focal irradiation and/or resection
are indicated in very early to intermediate stages. HCC
patients unsuitable for conservative therapies are then
ideal candidates for experimental, combined radiobiological approaches.
The serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase
1 (SGK1) is a member of the AGC (protein A, G, C,
families) kinase group, and shares structural and
functional similarities with the AKT family of kinases
[6]. mTORC2 phosphorylates the SGK1 hydrophobic
motif (H-motif) on serine 422 [7], thus priming the
kinase for phosphorylation by 3-phosphoinositidedependent kinase-1 (PDK1) [8]. SGK1 is regulated
by insulin, IGF-1, cAMP, glucocorticoids [9–12] and
IL-2 [13] and transduces survival signals in normal and
cancer cells. Increased SGK1 expression has been found
in several human tumors, including prostate carcinoma
[14],non-small cell lung cancer [15] and HCC [16–18].
Conversely, SGK1 knock-out models were shown to be
resistant to chemically-induced colon carcinogenesis
[19]. SGK1 regulates cell survival, proliferation and
differentiation via phosphorylation of Mouse Double
Minutes 2 (MDM2), which leads to the ubiquitylation
and proteosomal degradation of p53 [20]. SGK1 also
activates transcription of RANBP1, a major regulator
of the RAN GTPase, thus affecting mitotic stability
and paclitaxel sensitivity in colon carcinoma cells
[21]. Finally, SGK1 activates N-Myc down-regulated
gene 1 (NDRG1), by catalysing its phosphorylation on
threonine 346. The NDRG1 factor is considered to be a
specific SGK1 substrate [22]. However, in some breast
cancer cells lines displaying low/undetectable levels of
SGK1, and sensitive to Akt1 specific inhibitors, a marked
phosphorylation of NDRG1 was detected, that was
suppressed by Akt inhibitors, differently from resistant
cells [23], suggesting that under certain conditions Akt
can also phosphorylate SGK1 targets. NDRG1 has an
important role in cell proliferation and differentiation
[24,25] and a debated role in oncogenesis, as it mainly
behaves like an oncosuppressos in several tumor
models [26, 27], yet appears to be a key determinant of
resistance towards alkylating chemotherapy in malignant
gliomas [28] and is associated with aggressive tumor
behavior in HCC [29], where NDRG1 suppression
induces apoptosis [30].

RESULTS
SI113, a new inhibitor of SGK1, strongly reduces
cell viability in HCC cells
HepG2 and HuH-7 cell lines were plated
(see Methods section). After 24 h, when cells were
approximately 60% confluent, SI113 was added in
increasing concentrations (12.5, 25 and 50 μM), and cell
viability was estimated after 48 and 72 h. In both cell
lines, SI113 yielded a significant time- and dose-dependent
reduction in the number of viable cells (Figure 1, panel A
and B). All subsequent experiments were performed using
12.5 μM SI133, unless otherwise indicated.

SI113 inhibits cell cycle progression and induces
apoptosis in HuH-7 and HepG2 cell lines
in a time-dependent manner
We used flow cytometry to assess whether SI113
affected cell cycle progression. SI113 inhibited cell cycle
progression in both HepG2 and HuH-7 cell systems.
In HepG2, a significant reduction of cell population in
the G2/M phase was observed after 72 h of treatment,
concomitant with a significant increase in the percentage
of <G1 hypodiploid cells (Figure 2, panel A). In HuH-7
cells, the effect of SI113 was already evident after 48 h and
more significant at 72 h (Figure 2, panel C, Supplementary
File S2 for quantitative data and significance, and
Supplementary Figure S1–S4 for cell cycle and Guava
graphs). HepG2 and HuH-7 cells treated with SI113 for
24, 48 and 72 h were also analyzed by Guava Nexin Assay.
A significant increase in total cell death was demonstrated
in SI113-treated cells at each time point in both HepG2
and HuH-7cultures (Figure 2, panel B and D).
In particular, in HepG2 cells (Figure 2, panel B),
treatment with SI113 for 24 h yielded a significant increase
in early apoptotic cells, which gradually became more

significant as the treatment was prolonged to 48 h and 72
h. In HuH-7cells treated with SI113 (Figure 2, panel D),
late apoptotic cells increased progressively after 48 and
72 h. All differences with the corresponding controls
were highly significant, as indicated in Figure Legends
and Supplementary File S2. These data indicate therefore
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that SI113 gradually suppressed the fraction of cycling
cells and concomitantly activated the apoptotic response
pathways over time. These results were further confirmed
in Guava-based multi caspase assays and Western blot for
active caspase 3, which showed a clear pro-apototic effect
of SI113 (Supplementary Figure S5).

Evidence for selectivity of SGK1 targeting
by SI113

Stable Scrl or shSGK1-expressing HuH-7 cells
treated with SI113 for 72 h were also Guava Nexin
assayed (Figure 3, panel C). The early apoptosis fraction
significantly increased in ShSGK1-HuH-7 compared with
Scrl-HuH-7 cells, consistent with previous observations
[21]. SI113 treatment for 72 h increased all stages of cell
death, i.e. early apoptotic, late apoptotic and necrotic/
dead cells, selectively in Scrl-HuH-7. SI113 had instead
no pro-apoptotic effect in ShSGK1-HuH-7cells, in
which a modest decrease in late apoptotic cells - if any was recorded compared with vehicle-treated controls.
All differences with the corresponding controls were
significant and are indicated in Figure Legends and
Supplementary File S2. Taken together, these data strongly
suggest that SGK1 function is necessary for SI113 to elicit
its pro-apoptotic effect.

To verify the functional SGK1 specificity of SI113dependent effects on cell proliferation and survival, we
produced HuH-7 cell clones stably expressing either the
shRNA for SGK1 (ShSGK1-HuH-7cells) or a scrambled
shRNA (Scrl-HuH-7cells). SGK1 silencing was verified by
Western blot using anti-SGK1 antibodies (Figure 3, panel A).
Considering the low proliferation rate and increased
apoptosis typically observed in SGK1-silenced cell lines
[20], different cell numbers were plated. ScrlHuH-7 (1.5 ×
104 cells) and ShSGK1 (2.5 × 104 cells) were plated and,
after 24 h (when approximately 60% confluent), SI113 or
vehicle were added. Cell proliferation and viability were
estimated after 72 h, when both vehicle-treated cultures
had reached comparable cell numbers (ScrlHuH-7 cultures:
571333 ± 38456 cells; ShSGK1-HuH-7 cultures, 557333
± 44779 cells). We found that SI113 did not affect the
viability of ShSGK1 cells (dashed right histogram), while
significantly affecting that of Scrl-HuH-7 cells, in which
the number of viable cells decreased to 30% upon SI113
treatment (P = 0.008) (Figure 3, panel B).

down-regulated or up-regulated upon SGK1 specific
RNA silencing. Among those, we focused on the RAN/

SI113 and protein expression in HepG2
and HuH-7 cells

RANBP1 network, which pointed to SGK1 as a key
regulator of mitotic stability and paclitaxel resistance
[21,31]. We now extended our proteomic analysis
to HCC cells treated for 72 h with either SI113 or
vehicle alone.
After automatic spot detection, background
subtraction and volume normalization, we detected about
650 protein spots in HuH-7 cells treated with SI113 and
620 protein spots in vehicle-treated HuH-7cells. The
groups were thus compared, and 87 spots of interest
(matches) were used for tandem mass spectrometry
analysis. Only reproducibly detected spots were
subjected to statistical analysis. A list of significant upor down-regulated proteins is provided (Supplementary
Figure S6). Among differentially expressed proteins,
RAN-specific GTPase-activating protein (spot #22) and
GTP-binding nuclear protein RAN (spot #76) appeared
to be down-regulated following SI113-dependent
inhibition of SGK1 (Figure 4, panel A), mimicking
what was previously detected upon SGK1 specific RNA
silencing [21].

We also analyzed the expression of proteins that
are SGK1 targets and/or substrates by mono-dimensional
SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by
Western blot.
After treatment of HuH-7 and HepG2 cells with SI113
for 72 h, the expression of RAN, RANBP1, p-NDRG1,
NDRG1, pMDM2 and MDM2 was examined (Figure 4,
panels C and D). In treated samples, expression of RAN and
RANBP1 as well as phosphorylation of p-MDM2 (serine
166) were reduced, consistent with previously published
observations [20,24]. Phosphorylation of pNDRG1 was
clearly reduced in HuH-7 cells (Figure 4, panel D), whereas
in HepG2 cells it paralleled the reduction in NDRG1 total
abundance (Figure 4, panel C).

SI113 treatment produced a consistent tumor
suppression activity in HCC xenografts
in immunocompromised mice
HuH-7 cells (2.5 × 106) were implanted in the flanks
of NOD/SCID female mice for in vivo treatment with
SI113. We carried out two sets of experiments. In the
first one, 10 mice were used, randomly subdivided into
two batches. Treatment with SI113 started when tumor
volume reached 100 mm3, as assessed by manual caliper
measurement. The drug (or vehicle) was administered
daily and tumor growth was monitored every 4 days.
Mice were sacrificed when at least one tumor in either of
the two groups reached the volume of 700 mm3. Tumors
were then excised and weighed, while samples were
prepared for histology. An impressive reduction in tumor
growth was recorded in the treated batch compared with
controls (Figure 5, panel A, left). The difference was
already significant on the fourth day after the treatment
start and remained significant throughout the duration
of the experiment. On day 20, mice in the control group
reached the pre-set volume end point (688.57 ± 75.4 mm3),
whereas mice in the treated group showed a remarkably
smaller tumor volume (108.48 ± 22.9 mm3, P = 0.0009).
Measurements of the tumor weights (2.17 ± 0.29 g in
controls and 0.75 ± 0.10 g in the treated group, P = 0.007)
further confirmed the effectiveness of the treatment
(Figure 5 panel A, right). In tumor samples analyzed
by H&E staining (Figure 5, panel B), necrotic and dead
cells were significantly less represented in samples from
control compared with treated animals (P = 0.01). Data
automatically analyzed for staining intensity and specificity
are shown in graphic form (Figure 5, panel B, right).
In a second experimental set, 20 mice were enrolled
and randomly divided into two batches. HuH-7 cells
(3.5 × 106) were implanted in the flank of female NOD/
SCID mice as above, but tumors were allowed to grow
for 6 days before starting the treatment. CT scanning

Pathway analysis
The software IPA (Ingenuity® Systems, http://
www.ingenuity.com) was used to evaluate significant
pathways and networks associated with the differentially
expressed proteins. We first explored the network
characteristics of the differentially expressed proteins in
treated HCC cells relative to their controls. IPA analysis
predicted five networks (Supplementary Figure S7) of
interacting protein clusters according to the identifiers’
HomoloGene to the ortholog information in the
Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IKB). Network 1, with
a score of 63, comprised 27 nodes that had functions
associated with carbohydrate metabolism, energy
production, nucleic acid metabolism (Supplementary
Figure S8). Network 2 had functions associated with
amino acid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry,
cellular growth and proliferation (Figure 4, panel B
and Supplementary Figure S10). Next, we explored the
statistically enriched Molecular and Cellular Functions
(P value ≤ 0.05, Fisher’s exact test implemented in the
IPA, corrected with Benjamini-Hochberg method), and
identified functions, including: I) Post-Translational
Modification (P = 1.49−6), II) Protein Synthesis
(P = 1.49−6), III) Amino Acid Metabolism (P = 6.94−6),
IV) Small Molecule Biochemistry (P = 6.94−6), V)
DNA Replication, Recombination, and Repair (P =
1.37−5). Last, we searched for links to diseases and
bio-functions and found that differentially expressed
proteins were connected with: I) Cancer (n molecules
= 67, P = 3.19−2), II) Cellular Growth and Proliferation
(n molecules = 35, P = 6.56−5), III) Cell Death and
Survival (n molecules = 30, P = 1.10E-03), respectively.

was performed immediately before and on the last day of
treatment, before sacrifice (Figure 5, panel C). At treatment
onset, the mean tumor volume was 761 ± 40.4 mm3. Mice
were randomly assigned to either treatment or control
groups, as before. SI113 or vehicle were administered for
12 days and tumor volumes were recorded every 3 days,
until at least one tumor in either of the two groups reached
a volume of 4500 mm3 (Figure 5, panel D, top/left).
Tumor volumes in the treated group were already
significantly smaller than in the control group on the third
day of treatment and remained significantly smaller until
the mice were sacrificed. Weights of the excised tumors
(Figure 5, panel D, bottom/left) confirmed that mean value
of the tumors from the treated group was significantly
smaller than that from the control group (1.38 ± 0.17 g
vs. 3 ± 0.39 g, respectively; P = 0.001). Representative
images of the two tumor groups are provided in Figure 5,

dermatitis, ulceration, or signs of liver failure were noted
in SI113 treated mice. Differences in tumor volumes at
various times are detailed in the Figure.

or radiation, as single agents, significantly reduced the
number of viable cells, as expected. The combination of
SI113 and radiation reduced the number of viable cells
more than either agent alone (Figure 6, panel B).
We also examined the effects of SI113 and radiation
on the induction of apoptosis in both cell lines using the
Guava Nexin assay, as described above. In both cell lines,
treatment with either SI113 or radiation significantly
increased apoptosis. Treatment with both agents together
determined a more pronounced response than either agent
alone, reaching 93.5% in cells treated with SI113 plus 10
Gy radiation (Figure 6, panel C). Slightly different results
were obtained in HuH-7 cells, as total cell death (early
apoptosis, late apoptosis and necrosis) recorded with
single treatments increased significantly only when SI113
was added. The combined treatment also dramatically
increased the percentage of total dead cells in this cell line,
suggesting that the combination determined progression
through advanced phases of apoptosis and caused the
death of those cells that survived radiation administration
protocols (Figure 6, panel C). The actual differences in
the percentage of cells in the different phases of apoptosis,
together with the level of significance are detailed in
Figure Legend, and the graphs listed in Supplementary
Figure S10.
MDM2 phosphorylation experiments provided
mechanistic insight into the apoptotic process triggered by
treatment with SI113 or radiation. SGK1 stabilizes MDM2
via phosphorylation on serine 166, thereby facilitating
p53-dependent death [20]. Consistently, we found that
treatment of both HepG2 and HuH-7 cells, with either
SI113 (72 h) or 8 Gy radiation, significantly reduced
MDM2 phosphorylation on serine 166. The combined
treatment with SI113 and 8 Gy radiation induced a further
reduction in serine 166 phosphorylation, suggesting that
radiation synergizes with SGK1 inhibition in reducing
MDM2 phosphorylation and stability (Figure 6, panel D).

Synergy of SI113 with radiation-induced growth
inhibition and cell death indicates a possible role
of SGK1 in radio-resistance
The data so far indicate a detrimental effect of
SI113 on HCC progression. We therefore explored the
possibility that SI113-dependent inhibition of SGK1
might synergize with radiation therapy in HCC treatment.
Curves of sensitivity to ionizing radiations for HepG2 and
HuH-7 cells demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on cell
viability (details in Supplementary Figure S9).
To verify whether the level of SGK1 expression
affected radiosensitivity of liver cancer cell lines, we used
lentiviral vectors to produce stably transduced HepG2
and HuH-7 cell lines expressing either SGK1 specific
ShRNA (ShSGK1 cells) or wild type SGK1 (p-HivEGFP-SGK1 cells) to induce SGK1 silencing or over
expression, respectively. After irradiation, cell viability
in these cell lines was compared to that of ShSCRL cells
and p-HIV-EGFP lines, respectively. With both 8 and
10 Gy doses, SGK1 silencing determined a significant
reduction in the number of viable cells, whereas SGK1
overexpression determined a protective effect, denoted
as a significant increase in the number of viable cells,
compared with control cells (Figure 6, panel A). The
actual differences in cell number between engineered cells
lines and their corresponding controls, together with the
level of significance, are detailed in Figure Legend and in
Supplementary File S2.
We then evaluated the effect of SI113 on
radiosensitivity in HepG2 and HuH-7 cells 24 h after
plating. Cells were exposed to no radiation (0 Gy), 8 Gy
or 10 Gy, with or without treatment with SI113 (72 h),
and assayed for cell viability. In both cell lines, SI113

DISCUSSION
SGK1 has been recently attributed a role in
neoplastic transformation [11–14], and SGK1 specific
inhibitors have been tested in several neoplastic models,
including colon carcinoma [33–35]. In HCC, SGK1
expression is particularly relevant in highly malignant
tumors characterized by epithelial-to-mesenchimal
transition (EMT) that supports the underlying liver
cirrhosis [17]. A new SGK1 inhibitor [31] has now been
tested in two well-established cellular models of HCC, i.e.
HepG2 and HuH-7.
We show that SI113-dependent SGK1 inhibition
recapitulates the effects of SGK1-specific silencing on cell
cycle [20,21]. In both cell lines, SI113 treatment reduced the
fraction of cycling cells transiting through G2/M phase and
induced a concomitant increase in cell death, consistent with
the ability of SGK1 to regulate transcription of RANBP1

[21], a key regulator of the mitotic machinery [36–40]. We
also report the identification of 85 proteins differentially
modulated by SGK1, some of which are related to RAN
and RANBP1 (Supplementary Figure S6). SGK1 inhibition
results in down-regulation of RHOA [41,42], PAK2 [43]and
PHB [44], all of which are involved in progression through
G2/M. These proteins are also over-expressed in conditions
associated with liver metastasis, mitotic instability and drug
resistance [42–44]. On the other hand, ST-13 [45,46] and
MLC [47], two down-regulated proteins in HCC, appear to
be over-expressed upon SI113-dependent SGK1 inhibition.
Our previous work suggests that SI113 inhibits
SGK1 [31,32]. In the present paper, we demonstrate
that the expression of SGK1 is mandatory for SI113 to
decrease HCC cell viability and trigger apoptosis; these
effects are instead not detected in ShSGK1 cells. In these
cells, in fact, SI113 had no pro-apoptotic effect, whereas
a modest decrease in late apoptotic cells was recorded
compared with vehicle-treated SGK1 silenced cells.
These apparently incongruous results clearly indicate
that SGK1 expression is necessary for SI113 to elicit
its pro-apoptotic effect. On the other hand, however,
it is possible that, in the absence of SGK1, other
unknown SI113 molecular targets exert some effect.
This possibility must be taken into account in case of
tumors that are insensitive to SI113 or do not express
a functional SGK1. SGK1 pharmacological inhibition
also recapitulates the effects of SGK1 specific silencing,
on p53 degradation, enhancing the apoptotic response
to cellular stresses. Post-translational modifications
of p53, which may be important in HCC regulation of
cell metabolism in non-transformed hepatocytes [48],
are probably crucial in regulating cell proliferation
[49, 50]. Both RANBP1/RAN and MDM2/p53 pathways
are attributed a central role in cell transformation, in
regulation of cell proliferation and in response to mitotic
errors. Since SGK1 acts as a critical regulator in both
these pathways, we consider that SGK1 overexpression
may also have a central role in cancer.
The expression level of MDM2 affects cell
radiosensitivity, where decreased levels of MDM2
sensitize cells to ionizing radiations [51], especially
in tumors expressing wild-type p53. It is therefore
conceivable that the level of expression of SGK1 also
affects radiosensitivity. Indeed, we found that SGK1 gene
silencing yielded a clear-cut increase in radiosensitivity,
whereas its overexpression induced radioresistance.
Moreover, SI113-dependent inhibition of SGK1
synergized with radiotherapy in reducing the fraction of
viable cells and causing necro/apoptosis. Interestingly,
the combined radiation/SI113 therapy induced an almost
complete dephosphorylation of MDM2 on serine 166. We
also demonstrate that SI113 treatment inhibits NDRG1
phosphorylation in HuH-7 cell lines and yields a decrease
in NDRG1 overall abundance in HepG2 cells. This finding
may add another possible mechanism through which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

SGK1 inhibition might be beneficial in hepatocarcinoma
treatment; indeed, NDRG1 has been proposed as a
potential therapeutic target for HCC [29].
We finally present in vivo assays to test the effect
of SI113 in human hepatocarcinoma cells xenografted
in immunodeficient mice. The analysis of tumor volume
and weight demonstrates that SI113 arrests tumor growth,
whereas histology demonstrates high levels of necrosis
in tumors from treated animals. No signs of toxicity
were observed by histological examination of the livers
from S113-treated mice, nor did the mice show signs of
generally adverse side effects.
In conclusion, SI113, alone or in synergy with
radiotherapy, arrests tumor growth and induces apoptosis
and necrosis. These effects are specifically related to
SGK1 inhibition, which ultimately turns off several
pathways (e.g. RAN/RANBP1, MDM2/p53, NDRG1)
that represent convergent targets of the oncogenic
function of SGK1.
These results have potential relevance to possible
applications in human cancer therapy. In recent years,
several drugs have been developed to target the mTOR/
AKT1 pathways [52]. These drugs appear to be less
effective in tumors characterized by high levels of
SGK1 expression [23], moreover they are endowed
with intrinsic toxicity, as expected on the basis of the
phenotypes observed in mTOR and/or AKT1 knock-out
murine models [53, 54]. In contrast, SGK1 knock-out mice
display very subtle phenotypes, elicited in the presence
of particular metabolic conditions or cellular stresses
[19, 55]. Although more exhaustive toxicity studies of
SI113 are needed, from a theoretical point of view, SGK1
inhibition is predicted to be quite safe in normal cells, yet
is expected to be powerful in inhibiting proliferation and
survival in cancer cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
HCC cell lines
Human HCC cell lines HuH-7 and HepG2
were obtained from ATCC (Georgetown University
in Washington, DC) and cultured as indicated in
Supplementary File S1.

Recombinant DNAs
pHIV-EGFP-SGK1 for SGK1 expression and
pLKO.1-puro-ShSGK1 for RNA interference experiments
were prepared as indicated in Supplementary File S1
and used to generate lentiviral particles in HEK293T
packaging cells. Details for the preparation of virus
particles are provided in Supplementary File S1. For
negative controls, viral particles were produced in
HEK293T cells using either ShScrl (Sigma SHC002V) or
pHIV-EGFP, as indicated.

containing DMEM without serum and Matrigel solution
(BD Collaborative Research), in the dorsal posteriorlateral right region. Tumors were allowed to grow for
different times in separate experiments, as indicated in the
Results section. Mice were randomly assigned to 2 groups
of five or ten animals each and administered with either
SI113 (treated group) or vehicle alone (DMSO, control
group) for five days/week. Tumors were measured every
3 or 4 days by caliper in two perpendicular diameters
(a = smaller diameter; b = larger diameter) and the tumor
volume was calculated in accordance with the formula: V
= π/6 × a2 × b. Mice were subjected to CT scan (Toshiba
CT System, Model TSX-021B) after anesthetic induction,
before and after the treatment. Mice, under general
anesthesia, were sacrificed by vertebral dislocation.

ShSGK1-HuH-7/HepG2 cells
Supernatants from ShSGK1-HEK293T cells were
collected and used for transduction of HepG2 and HuH7 cells in the presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene (Sigma)
and selected in the presence of puromycin (1.2 μg/mL).
Transduced cells (ShSGK1-HuH-7/HepG2 cells) were
compared with control cells (ShScrlHuH-7/HepG2 cells).
pHIV-EGFP-SGK1 HuH-7/HepG2 cells
Supernatants from pHIV-EGFP-SGK1-HEK293T
cells were collected and used for transduction of HepG2
and HuH-7cells in the presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene
(Sigma). Transduced cells (pHIV-EGFP-SGK1HuH-7/
HepG2 cells) were compared with control cells (pHIVEGFP HuH-7/HepG2 cells).

Immunoblot analysis
SGK1 kinase activity on MDM2 and NDRG1 was
evaluated by Western blotting using phospho-specific
antibodies, according to previously published methods
[20,22]. The inhibitory effect of SI113 on MDM2 and
NDRG1 phosphorylation was monitored as detailed in
Supplementary File S1.

SI113 treatment
SI113 was developed as previously reported [32].
The drug was diluted (10 mM) in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and stored at −20°C for in vitro studies. For
in vivo experiments, SI113 (50 mM in DMSO) was
diluted 1:5 with saline solution to bring the final
concentration to 10 mM. Forty-three μl of this solution
were injected by intraperitoneal administration in
xenografted NOD/SCID female mice, to obtain a
final in vivo concentration of approximately 12.5 μM
corresponding to 8 mg/kg/day, assuming a volume of
drug distribution into the animal of 35 ml.

Proteomic analysis, nanoscale LC-MS/MS
analysis and pathway analysis
Proteomic analysis and pathway analysis were
performed according to previously published methods [56–58],
see Supplementary File S1 for a detailed description.

Proliferation assays

Cell cycle analysis

Cell proliferation was evaluated by measuring the
total number of cells with a Burker chamber. Unless
otherwise specified, HCC cells were plated at a density
of 2 × 105 cells/ml in six-well plates. Viability assays by
trypan blue exclusion dye was performed on adherent
cells incubated in the absence or presence of SI113, as
indicated. Viable cells at each time point were expressed
as the percentage of viable cells compared with the
vehicle-treated controls.

Propidium iodide staining was used to evaluate cell
cycle effects of SI113 alone or in combination with radiation.
HuH-7 and HepG2 cells were treated with SI113 as indicated.
Cells, fixed in 70% ethanol, were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature in PBS containing propidium iodide (20 μg/
ml), 0.1% NP40 and 40 μg/ml ribonuclease, and analyzed
by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis using
a FACScan© cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest
software according to previously published methods.

Mouse xenograft model and tumor growth delay
experiments

Apoptosis assay
Guava Nexin Assay was performed as previously
published [31]. Four populations of cells can be
distinguished in this assay: non-apoptotic cells Annexin
V(−) and 7-AAD(−); early apoptotic cells Annexin V(+)
and 7-AAD(−); late stage apoptotic cells Annexin V(+)
and 7AAD(+); necrotic/dead cells Annexin V(+) and
7AAD(−). The results include counts and percentages
of cells in each of the quadrant-defined populations, as
well as the mean fluorescence intensity of Annexin V and
7-AAD for each population.

Female NOD/SCID mice (4-week-old, Harlan,
Indianapolis, IN) were maintained under pathogen-free
conditions and given food/water ad libitum. Experiments
were carried out in accordance with the Catanzaro
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
guidelines, using an approved protocol. At 6 weeks
of age, mice were subcutaneously injected either with
2.5 × 106 or 3.5 × 106 HuH-7 cells, depending on specific
experimental design, suspended in 200 μl of a 1:1 solution
