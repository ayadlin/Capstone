Abstract
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) comprise targeting antibodies armed with potent small-molecule payloads. ADCs
demonstrate speciﬁc cell killing in clinic, but the basis of their
antitumor activity is not fully understood. In this study, we
investigated the degree to which payload release predicts ADC
activity in vitro and in vivo. ADCs were generated to target
different receptors on the anaplastic large cell lymphoma line
L-82, but delivered the same cytotoxic payload (monomethyl
auristatin E, MMAE), and we found that the intracellular
concentration of released MMAE correlated with in vitro
ADC-mediated cytotoxicity independent of target expression
or drug:antibody ratios. Intratumoral MMAE concentrations
consistently correlated with the extent of tumor growth inhibition in tumor xenograft models. In addition, we developed a

robust admixed tumor model consisting of CD30þ and CD30
cancer cells to study how heterogeneity of target antigen
expression, a phenomenon often observed in cancer specimens,
affects the treatment response. CD30-targeting ADC delivering
membrane permeable MMAE or pyrrolobenzodiazepine
dimers demonstrated potent bystander killing of neighboring
CD30 cells. In contrast, a less membrane permeable payload,
MMAF, failed to mediate bystander killing in vivo, suggesting
local diffusion and distribution of released payloads represents
a potential mechanism of ADC-mediated bystander killing.
Collectively, our ﬁndings establish that the biophysical properties and amount of released payloads are chief factors determining the overall ADC potency and bystander killing. Cancer

Introduction

afﬁnity, potency of the payload, receptor expression level, internalization rate, trafﬁcking, multiple drug resistance (MDR) status,
and other factors have all been implicated to inﬂuence the
outcome of ADC treatment in vitro (4–7). Thus, it is difﬁcult to
compare activity of different ADCs across cell lines, due to
multiple variable parameters. Indeed, two studies found no
correlation between cell surface CD22 expression and the activity
of ADCs targeting CD22 (using either MMAE or DM1; refs. 8, 9),
demonstrating the complexity of the multiple mechanisms contributing to ADC activity.
In addition to the direct killing of antigen-positive tumor
cells, ADCs also have the capacity to kill adjacent antigennegative tumor cells: the so-called "bystander killing" effect
(10). In vitro, this capacity has been observed in colony assays
and coculture systems. For example, huC242-DM1 ADCs were
found to mediate bystander killing using a colony coculture
assay in vitro and an admixed tumor model in vivo (11).
Similarly, intracellular released MMAE was reported to mediate
bystander killing in a coculture system (12). Recently, Breij and
colleagues suggested such bystander activity is relevant in
patient-derived xenograft models (13). Although these studies
provide examples of bystander killing, the underlying factors
controlling this property remain to be deﬁned. Here, we studied
two key parameters of ADCs: (i) the relationship between the
concentration of the released payload and ADC potency in vitro
and in vivo and (ii) the relationship between the membrane
permeability of the released payload and the extent of ADC
bystander killing. By targeting different receptors capable of
internalization and lysosomal trafﬁcking on L-82 cancer cells

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are targeted therapies consisting of three components: an antibody targeting a speciﬁc
tumor antigen, a linker, and a potent payload. Recent advances
in these ADC technologies have resulted in two FDA-approved
drugs (ADCETRIS and KADCYLA) and more than 30 ADCs in
clinical trials (1). The remarkable clinical response to ADCETRIS
validates the potential of ADCs as cancer drugs (2, 3).
Currently, payloads utilized in ADCs primarily include microtubule-disrupting agents [e.g., monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE)
and maytansinoid-derived DM1 and DM4] and DNA-crosslinking agents [e.g., calichaemicin and pyrrolobenzodiazepines
(PBD) dimers]. Although ADCs have demonstrated clinical and
preclinical activity, it has been unclear what factors determine
such potency in addition to antigen expression on targeted tumor
cells. For example, drug:antibody ratio (DAR), ADC-binding

Released Payload Impacts ADC Activity and Bystander Killing

using ADCs with various drug:antibody ratios (DAR), we determined how the concentration of the released MMAE correlated
with in vitro cytotoxic response and in vivo antitumor activity.
We found that intratumoral MMAE concentration correlated
with antigen-speciﬁc antitumor activity in vivo. Furthermore, we
established a robust admixed tumor model consisting of
CD30þ Karpas 299 cells and CD30, cAC10-vcMMAE–resistant
Karpas-35R cells, in which we observed potent bystander killing
of CD30 cells with ADCs containing MMAE or PBD dimers.
The roles of linker chemistry and the biophysical nature of the
payload in this bystander killing were also studied.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Karpas 299 and L-82 cells were obtained from Dr. Abraham
Karpas of the University of Cambridge and from the German
Collection of Microorganisms and cultures (DSMZ). The Karpas35R cell line was derived from Karpas 299 by continuous exposure
to cAC10-vcMMAE, and they were conﬁrmed as derivative of
Karpas 299 using SNP ﬁngerprint analysis by the ATCC. Cells
were grown in RPMI1640 media (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS
and 100 U/mL Penicillin and Streptomycin in a 37 C humidiﬁed
incubator with 5% CO2. For cytotoxicity assays, cells were plated
at an average density of 7,000 to 10,000 per well in 96-well tissue
culture plates and incubated with ADCs for 72 hours or 96 hours.
Each assay was performed in triplicate. Cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo (Promega), and IC50 values were
calculated using GraphPad Prism.
In vivo antitumor activity study
All animal studies were conducted following Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. For xenograft studies,
5 million Karpas 299 or Karpas-35R cells were implanted subcutaneously into SCID mice (Harlan). The admixed tumor model
was implanted with a mixture containing 2.5 million Karpas 299
and 2.5 million Karpas-35R cells. To titrate CD30þ cells in
admixed tumor model, a total of 5 million cells were implanted
in each mouse, whereas the number of Karpas 299 and Karpas35R cells was adjusted to achieve the ratios of 10%, 25%, and 50%
CD30þ Karpas 299 cells. One million L-82 cells were implanted
subcutaneously to NOD SCID IL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice for
xenograft studies (Jackson Laboratory). Treatment was initiated
when the average tumor size reached at least 100 mm3 for tumor
efﬁcacy studies. To measure released payload in tumors, treatment
was initiated at 250 to 400 mm3. Tumors were measured twice a
week, and the volume was calculated with the formula volume ¼
1/2  length  width  width.
Flow cytometry
Receptor expression on Karpas 299, Karpas-35R, and L-82 cells
was quantiﬁed using QIFIKit following the manufacturer's
instructions (Dako). The monoclonal antibodies used to measure
CD30, CD70, and CD71 surface expression were BerH2 (BD
Biosciences), h1F6 (14), and chimeric OKT9. Chimeric OKT9
was developed from mouse hybridoma cell line OKT9 (ATCC).
Flow cytometry of CD30 on Karpas-35R cells and admixed tumors
was performed using mouse monoclonal antibody BerH2 conjugated with R-phycoerythrin or isotype control (BD Biosciences),
and CD45 conjugated with allophycocyanin (BD Biosciences).
Stained cells were analyzed on FACS Calibur (BD).

Immunohistochemistry
Tumors were ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in parafﬁn, and sections were cut at 4-mm thickness. Staining
including de-parafﬁnization and heat-induced target retrieval in
the presence of EDTA was done on a Bond autostainer (Leica
Biosystems). Bond autostainer reagents were used for antibody
detection, nuclear counterstain, and buffer rinses. The following
primary antibodies were applied: rabbit anti-CD71 polyclonal
antibody (Proteintech Group) and mouse monoclonal antiCD30 Clone BerH2 (Dako). For detection, horseradish peroxidase-3,30 -diaminobenzidine (HRP-DAB) was used for CD30 IHC
(Bond Polymer Reﬁne DAB Kit), and alkaline phosphatase-fast
red was used for CD71 (Bond Polymer Reﬁne Red Kit). Hematoxylin was used to counter stain nuclei. Images were acquired on
an Olympus BX41 microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-Fi1
camera.
Antibody-drug conjugation
The syntheses of MMAE, MMAF, and PBD dimers have been
described previously (6, 15, 16). ADCs were prepared using
valine-citrulline (vc)–PAB linkers with an average drug loading
of 4 (15), unless speciﬁed otherwise. The glucuronide linker and
PBD linker conjugation has been described elsewhere (16, 17).
Intracellular and intratumoral drug measurement by LC-MS
Cell pellets were collected 24 hours after ADC treatment. Cell
count, diameter, and circularity were determined on Vi-Cell
Counter (Beckman Coulter). MMAE extraction and quantiﬁcation
method was identical to the protocol described in Okeley and
colleagues (12). Brieﬂy, tumors or cell pellets were homogenized
with methanol and acetonitrile containing internal standard (d8MMAE for MMAE detection and 13C-MMAF for MMAF detection).
The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm to precipitate
protein and protein-bound payloads. The supernatant was then
subjected to solid phase extraction, and signals of MMAE and
MMAF were detected by LC-MS.
Measurement of ADCs in plasma
Micro-titer plates were coated overnight with a murine IgG1
mAb with speciﬁcity to human light chain kappa (Jackson ImmunoResearch), or an anti-idiotype mAb that binds to cAC10.
Samples were diluted into the dynamic range of the assay with
na€ve mouse plasma. After a 1:40 dilution into assay diluent,
standards, controls, and samples were incubated on the coated
and blocked plates. Bound ADCs were detected with HRP-conjugated goat polyclonal antibody reagent with speciﬁcity to the Fc
region of human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After incubation and subsequent washing, 3,30 ,5,50 tetramethylbenzidine was
applied to the wells and the signal measured by absorbance at
OD450 nm–OD630 nm.

Results
The intracellular concentration of released MMAE drives ADC
cytotoxicity and potency in vitro
It has been shown that ADCs bind to tumor cells in vitro and
release payload inside cancer cells upon trafﬁcking to the appropriate subcellular organelles, e.g., lysosomes (12, 18, 19). Since
the released payload is the active component of the ADC, we
sought to evaluate whether the amount of released payload is
correlated with ADC activity by targeting the anaplastic large cell

lymphoma (ALCL) cell line L-82, which expresses CD30, CD70,
and CD71 (transferrin receptor) simultaneously (Fig. 1A;
ref. 20). An in vitro cytotoxicity assay of ADCs targeting CD30
(cAC10-vcMMAE, with a DAR of 2, 4, or 8), CD70 (h1F6vcMMAE with a DAR of 4), or CD71 (cOKT9-vcMMAE with a
DAR of 4) was used to determine the in vitro potency of these
ADCs. Their IC50 values varied from 2 ng/mL to 55 ng/mL,
which may reﬂect the variance of antigen expression level,
internalization rate, and DAR (Fig. 1B), consistent with our
previous report (21).
We then assessed how much MMAE was released inside L-82
cells after the treatment with these ﬁve ADCs at their respective
IC50 concentrations. Interestingly, the intracellular MMAE concentrations from these ADCs were similar, ranging between 98
nmol/L to 150 nmol/L, a variance of only approximately 1.5-fold
in contrast with the >20-fold difference in their IC50 values (Fig.
1C). These results indicate that the concentration of released

MMAE determines the extent of cell killing in vitro, independent
of antigen expression level or DAR.
The intratumoral concentration of MMAE correlates with ADC
antitumor activity in vivo
We then evaluated whether released MMAE correlates with
ADC potency in vivo. To minimize the effects of drug loading on
ADC pharmacokinetics in vivo (21), we only tested ADCs with four
MMAE molecules per antibody, conjugated to cAC10, cOKT9, or
h1F6. After a single dose of cAC10-vcMMAE treatment, L-82
tumors either had no response (0.5 mg/kg), growth delay (1
mg/kg), or complete remission (3 mg/kg). Similarly, cOKT9vcMMAE and h1F6-vcMMAE demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor response in the L-82 xenografts (Fig. 2A). Interestingly,
despite their different in vitro potencies (Fig. 1A and B), L-82
xenografts responded similarly to cAC10-vcMMAE, h1F6vcMMAE, and cOKT9-vcMMAE (Fig. 2A).

We also used LC-MS to measure the concentration of MMAE in
a parallel cohort of L-82 tumors with an identical treatment
regimen. Although tumor volume was not different among treatment groups 3 days after dose, the intratumoral MMAE measurement revealed two patterns (Fig. 2B). First, intratumoral MMAE
concentration increased proportionally to the ADC dose, which
corresponded to stronger antitumor activity. Second, the intratumoral MMAE concentration obtained from treatment with both
cOKT9-vcMMAE and cAC10-vcMMAE was similar at each dose,
consistent with the observation that tumor responded similarly to
these two ADCs (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that the intratumoral concentration of MMAE determines the antitumor activity
of ADCs in vivo, independent of antigen expression level, as was
the case for in vitro treatments.

299 tumor-bearing SCID mice with cAC10-vcMMAE, or nonbinding IgG-vcMMAE, followed by measurement of plasma
ADC, plasma MMAE, as well as intratumoral released MMAE
concentration. A single dose of 2 mg/kg cAC10-vcMMAE treatment resulted in tumor regression within 10 days, whereas IgGvcMMAE had no impact on tumor growth (Fig. 3A). This
observation is consistent with our previous report of cAC10vcMMAE–speciﬁc antitumor activity in Karpas 299 cell model
(22). Concordantly, intratumoral MMAE concentration measurement revealed a clear separation between cAC10-vcMMAE
and IgG-vcMMAE–treated animals (Fig. 3B). Approximately
300 nmol/L intratumoral MMAE was detected in tumors 3
days after cAC10-vcMMAE treatment. In contrast, the highest
concentration was only at 50 nmol/L in the group received IgGvcMMAE treatment. Overall, cAC10-vcMMAE yielded 5-fold
greater MMAE exposure than IgG-vcMMAE in tumors (area
under curve: 1,628 vs. 328 day.nmol/L).

activity. The proﬁles of cAC10-vcMMAE and IgG-vcMMAE were
similar in plasma, with an average half-life of 6.7 days for cAC10vcMMAE (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The plasma concentration of
MMAE in both treated groups was around 2 nmol/L at 4 hours
after dose, but cleared quickly in circulation (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). These data collectively show: (i) targeted ADCs deliver a
high concentration of MMAE to tumor, (ii) the amount of
intratumoral released MMAE correlates with ADC antitumor
activity, and (iii) the amounts of released MMAE determined the
extent of cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo.
Development of admixed tumor model with heterogeneous
CD30 expression
We have recently developed Karpas-35R cells (resistant to
cAC10-vcMMAE treatment) from the Karpas 299 cell line through
continuous exposure to SGN-35 (23). This derivative cell line has
lost surface CD30 expression but has retained CD71 expression as
conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometric analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
The absence of CD30 prevented cell killing by cAC10-vcMMAE or
cAC10-vcMMAF (IC50 > 5 mg/mL) in vitro. However, Karpas-35R
cells remain sensitive to CD71 binding ADCs such as cOKT9vcMMAE and cOKT9-vcMMAF (IC50 14 ng/mL; Fig. 4A). In vivo,
Karpas-35R tumors and Karpas 299 tumors grew at similar rates
when implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice. Karpas-35R cells
remained CD30 negative and hence were insensitive to cAC10vcMMAE treatment in vivo, while they were eradicated by cOKT9vcMMAE (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
These results prompted us to mix Karpas 299 and Karpas-35R
cells to develop a tumor model consisting of both CD30þ and
CD30 cells. A 1:1 ratio mixture of Karpas 299 and Karpas-35R
cells grew together at a similar rate to those tumors from individual cell lines (Fig. 4B). IHC staining revealed a heterogeneous
CD30 expression pattern in the admixed tumors, unlike the
homogeneous CD30 expression in Karpas 299 tumors or absence
of CD30 in Karpas-35R tumors (Fig. 4C). Importantly, the CD30þ
and CD30 cells formed an interspersed pattern, resembling the

2714 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

distribution seen in analyses of human tumors (24). IHC analysis
also conﬁrmed comparable CD71 expression in Karpas 299,
Karpas-35R, and the admixed tumors (Fig. 4C). FACS analysis
also demonstrated coexistence of CD30þ and CD30 cells in
admixed tumors (Supplementary Fig. S3A)
MMAE, but not MMAF, mediates bystander killing in vivo
We then studied the in vivo bystander killing potential of two
potent auristatin payloads, MMAE and MMAF, in this admixed
tumor model. MMAE and MMAF are structurally similar, and
cAC10-vcMMAE and cAC10-vcMMAF were both potently cytotoxic to Karpas 299 cells (Fig. 4A). However, MMAF is a more
hydrophilic molecule and less membrane permeable than MMAE
(6). In general, MMAF has a higher IC50 than MMAE in cell lines
(Fig. 5A), consistent with its lower membrane permeability.
After cAC10-vcMMAE (3 mg/kg, once i.p.) treatment, the
admixed tumors underwent complete remission within 1 week
after dose. Three of the ﬁve tumors remained in remission for 4
weeks. In contrast, cAC10-vcMMAF caused only a moderate
growth delay but no complete remissions (Fig. 5B). Nontargeting
controls IgG-vcMMAE or IgG-vcMMAF did not affect tumor
growth of the admixed tumors, whereas positive controls
(cOKT9-vcMMAE and cOKT9-vcMMAF) targeting CD71 led to
complete remissions (Fig. 5B). This experiment indicated that
complete tumor remission could result from bystander killing of
MMAE.
IHC analysis revealed that nonbinding control-treated tumors
consist of both CD30þ and CD30 cells, presumably because they
do not kill either CD30þ or CD30 Karpas 299 cells. Only CD30
cells were found in cAC10-vcMMAF–treated tumors, illustrating
that cAC10-vcMMAF eliminated most CD30þ cells (Fig. 5C).
Interestingly, the two tumors that relapsed from cAC10-vcMMAE
treatment were also found to be CD30 by the end of study,
indicating a small fraction of CD30 cells might have escaped
from bystander killing in these two remaining tumors (Fig. 5C).
We also performed LC-MS analysis of admixed tumors treated

with cAC10-vcMMAE or cAC10-vcMMAF and found the ADCs
released comparable amount of intratumoral drug (360 nmol/L
MMAE vs. 200 nmol/L MMAF; Supplementary Table S1). Continuous tumor growth in the cAC10-vcMMAF treatment group
was therefore likely because released MMAF could not diffuse into
neighboring CD30 cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate
intratumoral released MMAE, but not MMAF, can mediate potent
bystander killing in vivo.
Conjugation of MMAE using a glucuronide linker maintains
bystander killing in vivo
Encouraged by the result that the admixed tumor model can
differentiate a payload's bystander killing property, we then evaluated the role of the linkers in bystander killing by comparing MMAE
conjugated to cAC10 using either peptide (cAC10-vcMMAE) or
b-glucuronide (cAC10-glucMMAE; Fig. 6A; ref. 17) linkers. Complete remission of the admixed tumors was observed after a single
dose of cAC10-vcMMAE or cAC10-glucMMAE (Fig. 6B). As a control, intratumoral MMAE measurement conﬁrmed 320 nmol/L and
490 nmol/L MMAE was released from cAC10-vcMMAE and cAC10glucMMAE, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). These results
suggest that both of the cleavable linkers are releasing MMAE and
can mediate bystander killing in vivo.
Potent bystander killing activity of PBD conjugates in vivo
The DNA cross-linking PBD dimers have empowered ADCs to
overcome the multiple drug resistance phenotype observed in
acute myeloid leukemia (5, 16). Based on their membrane per-

www.aacrjournals.org

meable nature in vitro (5), we hypothesized that PBDs may also
have bystander killing potential. We engineered the cAC10 antibody to enable site-speciﬁc conjugation of two PBD molecules per
antibody by replacing the heavy chain serine residue at position
239 with a cysteine (cAC10ec-PBD; Fig. 6C; ref. 5). Remarkably,
cAC10ec-PBD treatment (0.1 mg/kg, once i.p.) resulted in complete remission of the admixed tumors in 5 of 5 (100%) animals
(Fig. 6D). In contrast, nonbinding IgGec-PBD did not delay tumor
growth. These data demonstrate that PBD-based ADCs can initiate
potent local bystander killing in vivo.
Antigen expression for PBD and MMAE-mediated bystander
killing
The high potency of a PBD payload suggested that it may
require fewer antigen-positive cells to enable bystander killing
activity than MMAE. To test this, admixed tumors were generated
with a titration comprising Karpas 299 cells from 10% to 25% and
50%. CD30 IHC of the resulting admixed tumors (200 mm3)
conﬁrmed a corresponding increase in CD30þ cell percentage
(Fig. 7A). Flow cytometric analysis of dissociated tumors also
conﬁrmed increasing CD30þ cell percentage in the admixed
tumors (34%, 61% and 69% CD30þ cells, respectively; Fig. 7B
and Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, tumors consisting of
69% and 61% CD30þ Karpas 299 cells underwent remission after
cAC10-vcMMAE or cAC10ec-PBD treatment. However, tumors
consisting of 34% Karpas 299 cells regressed subsequent to
cAC10ec-PBD treatment, whereas cAC10-vcMMAE only caused
a growth delay (Fig. 7C–E). These results argue that PBD ADCs

may require fewer CD30þ cells to mediate bystander killing in
vivo, presumably due to its superior potency.

Discussion
With recent approval of ADCETRIS and KADCYLA, ADCs have
become major players in oncology drug development pipelines,
as a result of the advancement in areas such as antigen selection,
linker chemistry, and payload optimization (25). However, the
challenge remains to select the appropriate cancer target, payload,
and linker to identify lead ADC candidates, mainly due to the
incomplete understanding of what factors drive of ADC activity in
the tumor microenvironment.
Released drug and ADC activity correlation
Here, we studied the role of released payload within the L-82
cell line by alternating target antigen and drug loading. This
allowed us to compare ADC activity of multiple ADCs without
other variables such as drug sensitivity and efﬂux status, which
may have confounded studies comparing multiple cell lines (8,
9). While our data suggest that antigen expression and DAR can
affect ADC potency, these factors are not restrictive. In contrast,
intracellular released payload appears to determine ADC potency
in vitro. Importantly, the amount of released MMAE also determines the antitumor activity of ADC in vivo, independent of
antigen expression, suggesting the ADC design shall aim to
improve intratumoral payload delivery. For example, a recent
conjugation method allowing higher drug antibody ratio may
help deliver more drug to tumors (26).

2716 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

It has been challenging to predict pharmacodynamics
responses using traditional pharmacokinetic parameters such as
total antibody and small-molecule concentrations (27, 28). Our
parallel measurement of plasma ADC, plasma MMAE, and intratumoral released MMAE suggests that intratumoral released
MMAE concentration correlates best with antitumor activity in
xenograft models. Although this observation is encouraging,
correlation between the intratumoral released payload concentrations and the clinical response to ADCs in patients remains to
be tested.
Modeling bystander killing in vivo
Part of the remarkable clinical response to cAC10-vcMMAE has
been attributed to the bystander killing effect of ADCs (2, 29). This
capacity may distinguish ADCs from each other in solid cancers,
where target heterogeneity is common (11, 30). There is an
absolute requirement for target expression in order to obtain
antitumor activity. Therefore, several studies have tried to understand bystander killing in vitro and in vivo (11–13, 30, 31). While in
vitro studies are informative, they often lack the close cell-to-cell
contact, which may limit the study of the phenotype. Admixed
tumor models mimicking heterogeneous expression have been
reported (11, 13). However, we have discovered that mixing two
distinct cell types, one expressing the target of interest and the
other does not, often led to outgrowth of a single-cell population
or spatial segregation of antigen-positive and -negative cells as
reported in other studies [data not shown (11)]. Here, we take
advantage of the Karpas-35R cells, which are essentially syngeneic
as Karpas 299 cells except for the CD30 expression. This can be

critical to develop admixed tumor models. Recently, a related
approach employing HT-26 cells engineered to overexpress
mesothelin was used to study the bystander killing of BAY 949343, an anti-mesothelin maytansine ADC (31). Based on these
observations, we propose these criteria for robust bystander
killing models: (i) the targeted cell line expresses the antigen of
interest in their cell surface; (ii) the bystander cell line lacks the
targeted antigen and is insensitive to the testing ADC; (iii) testing
doses are within the speciﬁc range where nonbinding ADCs are
not active on either cell line; and (iv) the target-positive and targetnegative cells are interspersed throughout the tumor.
The role of linker, payload, and target cells in bystander killing
Intratumoral MMAE released from cAC10-vcMMAE kills both
CD30þ cells and CD30 cells in vivo, whereas another auristatin
payload, MMAF, lacked such capacity. These data argue that
membrane permeability and the ability of the released payload
to diffuse through the tumor are required for bystander killing. In
line with this argument, the membrane permeable PBD dimer was
also found to mediate bystander killing. Therefore, it is important
to evaluate engineered payload for their membrane permeability
and bystander killing.
The role of linkers in bystander killing has been unclear, partly
due to introduction of "non-cleavable" linkers. For example, it has
been reported that a noncleavable linker may abolish the bystander killing capacity of DM1 (11). However, it is important to note
that this noncleavable linker releases a modiﬁed payload (e.g., T-

www.aacrjournals.org

DM1 releases lysine-MCC-DM1 instead of DM1; ref. 32); the
membrane permeability and potency of lysine-MCC-DM1 may be
drastically different from that of DM1. In the present study, we
found two different linkers (b-glucuronide and vc-PAB), both
release MMAE and mediate bystander killing similarly in vivo.
These results demonstrate that the bystander killing property is
mainly determined by the biophysical properties of the released
payload, as opposed to the speciﬁc details of the linker and the
mechanism of drug release.
The role of antigen-positive cancer cells in bystander killing is
also evaluated in this study. As expected, a higher percentage of
target-positive cells in admixed tumors leads to more pronounced
tumor regression. Interestingly, the extent of bystander killing can
be related to payload potency. Our results suggest that PBD-based
ADCs can mediate bystander killing in admixed tumors with as
little as 34% antigen-positive cells while MMAE-based ADCs
required higher percentages. Hence, the abundance of antigenpositive cell required for bystander killing may vary according the
payload potency.
These ﬁndings collectively argue that the locally released payload
from the ADC determines the activity of killing of tumor cells and
bystander cells. This is particularly important for selecting appropriate payload for novel tumor antigens. Heterogeneity of antigen
expression often presents obstacle for ADC development in solid
tumors; therefore, a membrane permeable payload may provide
maximal killing of tumor cells (11). In contrast, when antigen
expression is homogeneous on cancer cells (e.g., CD19 and CD79b
