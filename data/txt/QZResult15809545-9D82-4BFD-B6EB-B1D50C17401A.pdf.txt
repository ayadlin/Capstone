BACKGROUND: Metastatic tumor antigen 1 (MTA1) overexpression is closely associated with postoperative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been suggested that pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) can prevent the occurrence of HCC in patients who
have chronic viral hepatitis. In this study, the authors examined whether postoperative adjuvant Peg-IFN therapy can reduce the
recurrence of MTA1-positive HCC after curative surgical resection. METHODS: In this case-control study, 93 patients with MTA1-positive HCC who underwent curative surgical resection were prospectively enrolled. The median patient age was 53 years (range, 27-78);
there were 65 men and 28 women; the etiology was hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 77 patients, hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 6 patients, and
V
non-HBV/non-HCV in 10 patients; 31 patients received Peg-IFN (Peg-INTRON ) subcutaneously at a dose of 50 lg per week for 12
months (the Peg-IFN group); and the remaining 62 patients were followed only and did not receive any adjuvant therapies (control
group). Patients were followed every 1 to 3 months for a median of 24 months. RESULTS: HCC recurred postoperatively in 26 of 93
patients (28%), and 9 patients (10%) died during follow-up. The overall cumulative recurrence rates were significantly lower in the
Peg-IFN group than in the control group (7% and 14% vs 24% and 34% at 1 year and 2 years, respectively; P <.05). In addition, the 1year and 2-year cumulative survival rates were higher in the Peg-IFN group compared with the control group (100% vs 93% and 100%
vs 87%, respectively; P <.05). In multivariate analysis, the receipt of adjuvant Peg-IFN therapy, in addition to having a lower Cancer of
the Liver Italian Program score and being a woman, was an independent, favorable factor for a lower risk of postoperative recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: The current data indicate that adjuvant Peg-IFN therapy may reduce the recurrence of HCC in patients who have

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by its high prevalence and aggressiveness, which accounts for a major
cause of death in the Far East and in sub-Saharan Africa.1,2 Clinically, only less than 10% to 20% of patients with HCC
have previously been considered candidates for surgical resection.3-5 Furthermore, frequent marginal or remote recurrence
of HCC in the remnant liver is another insurmountable problem in light of long-term prognosis.6,7 According to previous
studies, postoperative recurrence rates after surgical resection reached approximately 50% to 80%, whereas our recent
studies reported relatively lower recurrence rates.8-12
Metastatic tumor antigen 1 (MTA1) plays an important role in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of various human
malignancies, such as liver, breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, and gastric cancers.13,14 Our recent study demonstrated that
MTA1 overexpression is associated with frequent postoperative recurrence as well as microvascular invasion compared
with negative MTA1 status and, consequently, can be used a valuable predictor of worse postoperative outcomes for
patients who have HCC with respect to recurrence and survival.15 Such findings are in accord with previous findings indicating that MTA1 is overexpressed in HCC with overgrowth and/or vascular invasion.16,17

Figure 1. The enrollment of patients in the pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) group is illustrated. MTA1 indicates metastatic tumor
antigen 1.

Such a high recurrence rate after curative resection
for HCC has resulted in many efforts to design several
adjuvant therapies as preventive strategies, especially in
selected patients at a high risk of postoperative recurrence,
although, to date, no definite adjuvant therapy has been
identified. Of these, a few recent studies have demonstrated that interferon (IFN), a kind of antiviral agent, has
antitumorigenic effects in hepatocarcinogenesis, even for
those patients who do not achieve complete viral eradication.18-20 In light of the effects of adjuvant IFN therapy
on HCC recurrence after surgical resection, it has been
suggested that adjuvant IFN therapy may reduce late
recurrences after surgery or prolong the disease-free
survival, although this has not been validated statistically
in a general study population.4,21
Taken together, we believe that these findings
deserve a careful re-evaluation to determine whether adjuvant IFN therapy may prevent or retard HCC recurrence
in a particular subgroup that has a very high risk of recurrence. Thus, the objective of the current study was to
investigate whether postoperative, adjuvant pegylatedIFN (Peg-IFN) therapy can reduce the rate of recurrence
after curative surgical resection in patients with MTA1positive HCC who are at high risk of recurrence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

This was a phase 2 clinical trial of Peg-IFN with a group
of historic controls, which included 93 patients who had
MTA1-positive HCC and underwent curative surgical
resection (31 patients in the experimental group vs 62
patients in the control group). To recruit the adjuvant
Peg-IFN treatment group (the Peg-IFN group), 276
consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection
for HCC were prospectively screened for MTA1 status
from March 2008 to October 2009 at Asan Medical
Center (Seoul, Korea). First, 77 of these patients who
did not meet the criteria for curative surgical resection,
as described in Figure 1, were excluded. Then, immunohistochemical staining for MTA1 was performed, and
67 of the remaining 199 patients (34%) were identified
as MTA1-positive. Of those 67 patients, 31 were finally
included in Peg-IFN group. The algorithm for the
enrollment of patients for the Peg-IFN group is
displayed in Figure 1. Another 62 patients with MTA1positive HCC who underwent curative surgical resection
between January 2007 and February 2008 were selected
consecutively as historic controls (the control group) at a
proportion of 1:2.

Adjuvant Therapy for MTA1-Positive HCC/Lee et al

All patients fulfilled the following requirements: 1)
ages 20 to 75 years, 2) histologically confirmed HCC
based on surgical specimens, 3) underwent curative surgical resection, and 4) immunohistochemistry revealed the
overexpression of MTA1 in tumor tissues based on the
previously published criteria.15,22 Exclusion criteria were
as follows: 1) hepatic decompensation at enrollment indicated by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, gastroesophageal
varices, serum bilirubin >3.0 mg/dL, or serum albumin
<3.0 g/dL; 2) renal impairment defined as a serum
creatinine concentration >1.4 mg/dL; 3) hematologic
abnormalities, such as an absolute neutrophil count
<1,000/mm3 or a platelet count <50,000/mm3; 4) other
contraindications to IFN therapy, such as hypersensitivity, psychiatric illnesses, or uncontrolled thyroid diseases;
5) pregnancy or currently breast feeding; or 6) unwillingness to participate in the study. Curative surgical resection
was affirmed both histologically and radiologically when
all HCCs were completely resected, including 1) a free
resection margin, 2) no evidence of remaining intrahepatic tumors, 3) no macrovascular or microvascular invasion, 4) no lymphatic invasion, and 5) no distant
extrahepatic metastases.
The level of MTA1 expression was evaluated by
immunohistochemical staining with tumor and nontumor tissues using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex
method with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine as chromogen and
an LSAB (labeled streptavidin biotin) kit (DAKO,
Carpinteria, Calif). The detailed methodology of immunohistochemical staining was described in our previous
study.15,22 The intensity of MTA1 staining in tumor cell
nuclei was evaluated by an experienced pathologist in a
blind fashion. The areas of the most intense staining and
predominant patterns were scored. Staining intensity was
graded as negative (0% [2]), weakly positive (<50%
[1]), and strongly positive (>50% [11]), depending on
the proportion of positive tumor cells.
Strategy of Adjuvant Pegylated Interferon
Therapy and Assessment of its Adverse Events

The Peg-IFN group received Peg-IFNa-2b (PegINTRONV; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) subcutaneously at a dose of 50 lg once weekly for 12 months.
The dose of Peg-IFNa-2b was fixed according to the dose
used in previous reports.5,23 Peg-IFN injection was started
within 8 weeks after surgery. Peg-IFN therapy was
discontinued if life-threatening adverse events or hepatic
decompensation developed. It was also stopped if
HCC recurred, if the absolute neutrophil count was
<500/mm3, or if the platelet count was <30,000/mm3.

In the control group, patients were followed only and
received no adjuvant therapy.
Adverse events in the Peg-IFN group were evaluated
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Event (CTCAE) version 3.0. This study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the Asan Medical Center
and the Korea Food and Drug Administration. Written
informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Endpoints of the Study and Follow-Up

All patients in the Peg-IFN group were followed at 1
month and 3 months postoperatively and then were
examined regularly at intervals of 3 months during the
period of Peg-IFN treatment. After the completion of
adjuvant Peg-IFN therapy, the patients attended an outpatient clinic at every 3 to 6 months. Patients in the control group also received an evaluation at 1 month and
then at 3-month to 6-month intervals. At baseline, tumor
characteristics, such as size and number, were obtained.
We also assessed the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program
(CLIP) score, which comprise Child-Turcotte-Pugh class,
tumor morphology, serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) level, and
the presence of vascular invasion.24 At every visit, a history
and physical examination, hematology, coagulation, serum biochemistry, and serum AFP levels were obtained.
Dynamic computed tomography scans or magnetic
resonance images were obtained every 3 to 6 months for
surveillance of HCC recurrence during follow-up. Recurrent HCC was diagnosed clinically based on the typical
hypervascular pattern observed on dynamic images as well
as serum AFP levels according to practice guidelines of the
American Association for the Study of Liver Disease. The
primary study endpoint was the recurrence of HCC after
curative surgical resection, and the secondary endpoint
was HCC-related death.
Statistical Analyses

All data reported are expressed as the median (range) or
number (%), as appropriate. Follow-up duration was calculated from the date of surgery to the patients’ last visit
or death. The time to recurrence and overall survival duration were measured from the date of operation to time of
HCC recurrence and death, respectively. To identify predisposing factors for the postoperative recurrence of
HCC, the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and a
Cox proportional hazards model was used. All analyses
were performed in the overall study population according
to the intention-to-treat principle. All significance tests
were 2-tailed, and P values < .05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics of Enrolled Patients

Baseline demographic, laboratory, and clinical characteristics (n 5 93; 31 in the Peg-IFN group vs 62 in the control
group) are listed in Table 1. The median follow-up period
was 24 months (range, 1-47 months), the median age was
53 years (range, 27-73 years), there was a predominance of
men (70%). Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
accounted for HCC etiology in 83% of patients. Nearly all
patients had relatively well preserved liver function with
Child-Turcotte-Pugh Class A (92 of 93 patients). The majority of patients had single and nodular type HCC, and the
median tumor size was 3.3 cm in greatest dimension. The
CLIP score ranged from 0 to 2. Patients who had either histologic or radiologic evidence of microvascular or macrovascular invasion were excluded. There were no other
remarkable differences in biochemical, serologic or clinical
features between the two groups; and the distribution in the
intensity of MTA1 overexpression in HCC tissues did not
differ from each other group significantly.
Adverse Events on Adjuvant Pegylated
Interferon Therapy

The most common adverse event of adjuvant Peg-IFN
therapy was thrombocytopenia <150,000/mm3 (93%),
followed by neutropenia (74%), and flu-like symptoms
(61%), such as a myalgia, febrile sense, chills, or anorexia.

Recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma After
Curative Surgical Resection

During follow-up, HCC recurred in 28% of patients overall
(26 of 93 patients). The median duration from the date of
operation to the detection of recurrent HCC was 20.5
months (range, 1.3-45.5 months). The overall cumulative
HCC recurrence rates were 18% at 1 year, 27% at 2 years,
and 32% at 3 years. HCC recurred most commonly within
the liver (n 5 22) but was distantly metastasized to lung (2

higher CLIP scores corresponded with higher recurrence
rates of HCC (16%, 36%, and 38% for CLIP scores of 0,
1, and 2, respectively, at 2 years; P 5 .023). However,
other baseline characteristics, including age, serum AFP
levels, and the presence of cirrhosis, in addition to tumor
characteristics, such as size, the presence of multiple
tumors, type, and histologic differentiation, were not
associated significantly with HCC recurrence.
In multivariate analysis, adjuvant Peg-IFN therapy
was identified as an independent, favorable predictor of
less frequent recurrence after curative surgical resection in
patients with MTA1-positive HCC (P 5 .044). Conversely, being a man (P 5 .046) and higher CLIP scores
(P 5 .037) were identified as significant independent risk
factors for frequent HCC recurrence (Table 3).

31 patients (13%) in the Peg-IFN group developed recurrent HCC, and 22 of 62 patients (35%) in the control
group developed recurrent HCC.
Factors Predisposing Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Recurrence After Curative Surgical Resection in
MTA1-Positive Patients

The overall cumulative recurrence rates of HCC were significantly lower in the Peg-IFN group than in the control
group (7% and 14% vs 24% and 34% at 1 year and 2
years, respectively; P 5 .029) (Fig. 2). Clinical
parameters, such as being a man and a higher CLIP scores,
also were associated with frequent HCC recurrence: The
1-year cumulative recurrence rate was higher in men than
in women (20% vs 11%, respectively; P 5 .018), and

Subgroup Analysis of Recurrence in Patients
With Hepatitis B Virus-Associated
Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Among 77 patients who had HBV-associated HCC, 22
patients developed recurrent HCC after undergoing
curative surgical resection. The Peg-IFN group had
significantly lower recurrence rates of HCC compared with
the control group (8% and 13% vs 26% and 34% at 1 year
and 2 years, respectively; P 5 .027) (Fig. 3). In addition,
being a man (P 5 .024) and higher CLIP scores (P 5 .038)
were associated significantly with frequent recurrence rates
of HCC in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis also
identified adjuvant Peg-IFN therapy as a significant factor
for a lower rate of recurrent HCC in patients with HBV
infection (P 5 .049) (Table 4).
Survival of Patients With Hepatocellular
Carcinoma who Underwent Curative
Surgical Resection

During follow-up, 9 patients in the control group died of

with metastatic tumor antigen 1 (MTA1)-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent curative surgical resection in relation to the study groups.

The overall cumulative death rates were 4% at 1 year, 9% at

In terms of study groups, the 1-year and 2-year

tend to have lower survival rates compared with patients
who had smaller tumors (94% vs 100% at 1 year and 89%

rates were not associated significantly with age, baseline

DISCUSSION
Perioperative outcomes after hepatic resection for HCC
have been markedly ameliorated thanks to improved surgical techniques and up-to-date perioperative management.25,26 Nevertheless, a rather frequent occurrence of
recurrence, even after curative surgical resection, remains
a troublesome hindrance to be challenged in patients with
HCC. This is why hepatologists and oncologists draw
attention to adjuvant therapies after curative resection
of HCC.
Peg-IFN a-2b is a covalent conjugate of recombinant
IFN-a2b with a monomethoxy polyethylene glycol in a
1:1 M ratio that produces a 31,000-Da molecule.27,28 PegIFN has a longer serum half-life and produces more potent
therapeutic effect than a classic type of IFN. Either PegIFN or classic IFN is regarded as a multifunctional cytokine
that possesses antiproliferative activity and antiangiogenic
effect as well as antiviral or immunoregulatory activities.28-30
Currently, it is reported that IFN has highly suppressive
effects not only at the early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis
but also on the recurrence of HCC after curative treatment
in patients with chronic viral hepatitis.31-34 Although these
suppressive effects of IFN on recurrence of HCC are still
controversial, several meta-analyses have demonstrated that
IFN has a significant beneficial effect after curative treatment for HCC in terms of both survival and tumor recurrence.2,35 Such various results regarding IFN therapy
suggest that IFN used postoperatively may inhibit or at
least retard HCC recurrence in part if applied carefully
under highly selected conditions, like MTA1-positive
HCC, and is not for all patients. On the basis of this hypothesis, for the current study, we enrolled only patients
who had a high risk of a postoperative HCC recurrence
and who were screened for MTA1 overexpression.

Adjuvant Therapy for MTA1-Positive HCC/Lee et al

Our previous study clearly demonstrated that MTA1
overexpression is associated with frequent postoperative recurrence of HCC through a multistep processes.15 Basically, MTA1 increase angiogenesis by stabilizing the
hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) protein and
enhancing transcriptional activity of HIF-1a.13 Subsequently, HIF-1a induces angiogenesis in hypoxic conditions within the liver by increasing the expression of
angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).17 These findings suggest that MTA1 plays a
crucial role in angiogenesis, which is one of the main mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Peg-IFN may exert
its antiangiogenic activity through VEGF suppression, by
down-regulating HIF-1a expression and inhibition of the
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and/or mitogen-activated
protein kinase signaling pathways.36 In addition, Peg-IFN
reduces proliferating cell nuclear antigen and G1 cyclin
expression; thus, it has a stronger effect on growth inhibition and apoptosis. In accordance with the given mechanism, our Peg-IFN group in the current study had
significantly a lower postoperative recurrence rate of HCC
than the control group, although both groups had MTA1positive HCC and had a high risk of recurrence. The beneficial effect of adjuvant Peg-IFN therapy may result from
both antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects, especially
in patients who have MTA1-positive HCC—a selected
group with a particular feature of HCC.
The postoperative HCC recurrence rate among
MTA1-positive patients also was affected by CLIP score
and sex along with adjuvant Peg-IFN treatment. In the
current study, we observed that higher CLIP scores and
being a man were other independent predictors of recurrent HCC in MTA1-positive patients after curative resection. These results are consistent with previous reports on
recurrent HCC.37,38 Conversely, in our current study,
tumor characteristics, such as the number and type of
tumors, that were poorly distributed or tended to flow in
a certain direction toward early stage, resectable HCC,
rendered previously well known risk factors of HCC
recurrence statistically insignificant.
Another finding of importance is that the cumulative survival rates tend to be higher in the Peg-IFN group
than in the control group, although this was not a significant independent factor in multivariate analysis (data not
shown). It may be attributable to the relatively short duration of follow-up, the small number of patients (31
patients in the Peg-IFN group and 62 patients in the control group), and pattern of recurrence. First, we followed
the patients for a median of only 24 months, which was
not long enough to attain a statistical difference in surCancer

HCC, 22 had an intrahepatic recurrence alone. In other
words, they were not only clinically controllable at the
time of recurrence, but they also did not influence the survival analysis during the relatively short follow-up.
In light of IFN-induced side effects, adjuvant PegIFN therapy at a dose of 50 lg appeared well tolerated in
our study group. Among 31 patients who received PegIFN, the adverse events most commonly experienced were
thrombocytopenia, followed by neutropenia, and/or flulike symptoms, all of which were mild (grade 1-2) and
transient in most patients; no patients had to discontinue
adjuvant Peg-IFN therapy. This means that low-dose
Peg-IFN therapy is generally safe and tolerable in patients
with HCC after curative surgical resection.
There is a limitation of this study, which was not a
randomized controlled trial but a kind of preliminary
study. In such a case-control study, a certain selection bias
may affect clinical outcomes in addition to the treatment
modality. In addition, this type of phase 2 trial may cause
an imbalance in some clinical variables, such as age, sex ratio, and tumor size, and it may affect recurrence rates,
although no significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. However, such a
case-control study should be performed before a largescale enrollment followed by randomization, especially
for a study in which it is not easy to include highly selected
patients who have HCC with both positive MTA1 status
(approximately 34% of all HCCs) and the potential to
achieve curative surgical resection (<20% of all HCCs).
To compensate for this limitation, we enrolled patients
both consecutively and prospectively to perform the study
without a bias if possible. Another limitation is the relatively lower recurrence rate after surgical resection in the
control group compared with the recurrence rates in previous reports. Our patients fulfilled very strict criteria for
enrollment, which excluded patients with microvascular
and macrovascular invasion, as discussed above. Moreover, in this study, follow-up duration was relatively short
(median, 24 months). This suggests a possible reason why
our study reflected relatively lower recurrence rates.
In conclusion, our data suggest that adjuvant PegIFN therapy may reduce the recurrence of HCC after curative surgical resection in patients with MTA1-positive
HCC—a carefully selected group with a high risk of
HCC recurrence. In addition, high CLIP scores and being
a man may be other useful clinical markers to predict
postoperative recurrence in patients with MTA1-positive
HCC. To move forward, randomized, multi-institutional
trial may be an appropriate next step.
