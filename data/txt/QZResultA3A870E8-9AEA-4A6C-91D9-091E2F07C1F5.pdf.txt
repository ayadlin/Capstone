ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Calcium antagonists play an important role
in clinical practice. However, most of them have serious side effects. We have
synthesized a series of novel calcium antagonists, quaternary ammonium salt
derivatives of haloperidol with N-p-methoxybenzyl (X1), N-m-methoxybenzyl (X2)
and N-o-methoxybenzyl (X3) groups. The objective of this study was to investigate
the bioactivity of these novel calcium antagonists, especially the vasodilation activity
and cardiac side-effects. The possible working mechanisms of these haloperidol
derivatives were also explored.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Novel calcium antagonists were synthesized by
amination. Compounds were screened for their activity of vasodilation on isolated
thoracic aortic ring of rats. Their cardiac side effects were explored. The patch-clamp,
confocal laser microscopy and the computer-fitting molecular docking experiments
were employed to investigate the possible working mechanisms of these calcium
antagonists.
RESULTS: The novel calcium antagonists, X1, X2 and X3 showed stronger
vasodilation effect and less cardiac side effect than that of classical calcium
antagonists. They blocked L-type calcium channels with an potent effect order of
X1 > X2 > X3. Consistently, X1, X2 and X3 interacted with different regions of Ca2+-CaMCaV1.2 with an affinity order of X1 > X2 > X3.
CONCLUSIONS: The new halopedidol derivatives X1, X2 and X3 are novel calcium
antagonists with stronger vasodilation effect and less cardiac side effect. They could
have wide clinical application.

spastic diseases [1, 2]. Calcium channel blockers for clinical
usage are categorized as dihydropyridines, phenylalkylamine
or benzothiazepines. They are not recommended for patients
with heart failure, sinus node or atrioventricular node
dysfunction due to some unwanted serious side effects [3–5].
This has led to limited or completely restricted use of certain

calcium antagonists. Therefore, identifying novel calcium
channel blockers with vasodilation activity and less cardiac
side effects are needed.
Haloperidol is a classic antipsychotic drug
belonging to the butyrophenones group. Our previous
study revealed that quaternary ammonium salt
derivatives of haloperidol could partly antagonize the
contraction of coronary artery and protect myocardial
cell against ischemia-reperfusion injury [6, 7].
Subsequent to these findings, a series of derivatives
were synthesized, and screened for their vasodilation
activity. These haloperidol derivatives were found to
have vasodilation effect [8]. It was also noted that some
of these derivatives have less cardiac side effects.
In this study, we synthesized three new haloperidol
derivatives X1, X2 and X3, with para- meta-, and orthosubstituted N-methoxy-benzyl group respectively. We
studied their Ca2+ antagonistic effect and cardiac side effect
in comparison with traditional calcium antagonists. We
explored their possible working mechanisms. The results
have potential use for developing novel calcium antagonists
with stronger activity and less cardiac side effects.

0.5  mg/kg and 1 mg/kg reduced heart rate (HR), left
ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) and ± dp/dtmax, and
simultaneously increased left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure (LVEDP), to different levels. Nifedipine lowered
LVSP and ± dp/dtmax and simultaneously increased
LVEDP to different degree. Due to a compensatory
reaction, nifedipine slightly increased HR at 0.5 mg/kg
and slightly reduced HR at 1 mg/kg. These changes were
considered as adverse effects on the heart [16]. However,
X1, X2 and X3 had less effect on HR at all concentrations.
At concentrations of 0.25 mg/kg and 0.5mg/kg, X1, X2
and X3 did not affect LVSP, ± dp/dtmax and LVEDP. At 1
mg/kg, the X1 and X2 temporarily reduced the LVSP and
+dp/dtmax, increased LVEDP, but did not affect -dp/dtmax
(Table 1). In summary, X1, X2 and X3 showed fewer side
effects on heart.

Vasodilation on rat aortic rings
The vasodilation activity of X1, X2 and X3 were
investigated. The rat model of KCl-induced aortic ring
contraction is the classic model in vitro for screening the
vasodilation drugs [17, 18]. The X1, X2 and X3 at 0.1 to
10 μM showed vasodilation activity to varying degrees
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1). The IC50 of
X1, X2 and X3 were 0.432, 4.22 and 7.42 μM (P < 0.01),
respectively. The maximum inhibition on the vascular ring
contraction was 92.5%, 67.08% and 48.66%, respectively
for X1, X2 and X3. The order of vasodilation activity was
X1 > X2 > X3 (P < 0.01).

RESULTS
Synthesis of para-, meta- and ortho-substituted
N-methoxy-benzyl haloperidol derivatives
(X1, X2, X3)
The raw material haloperidol was reacted with para-,
meta- and ortho-substituted benzyl chloride to form the target
compounds X1, X2 and X3 (Scheme 1). These compounds
were identified by IR, HNMR and MS (Table S1, S2).

Inhibition of KCl-induced rat myocardial
extracellular calcium influx
The effect of X1, X2 and X3 on calcium influx was
investigated on rat myocardiocytes. In this experiment,
60 mM KCl was added to induce the myocardial extracellular
calcium influx. Ca2+ fluorescent intensity increased when
KCl was added. The verapamil (10 μM) was used as
positive control. It reduced Ca2+ fluorescence intensities by
86%, most likely due to block calcium channels and inhibit

the KCl-induced extracellular calcium influx [22]. Under
the same conditions, use of X1, X2 and X3 (0.1–10 μM)
in incubated cells reduced Ca2+ fluorescent intensity in a
maximum degree by 76.5%, 53.6% and 24.53% respectively
(Figure 2). These results demonstrated that the X1, X2 and X3
can inhibit the KCl-induced myocardial intracellular calcium
concentration. The inhibitory effects were in the order of X1
> X2 > X3. These results were in consistent with their effects
of vasodilation activity.

70.2%, and the IC50 was 0.472, 0.493 and 0.721 μM
respectively for X1, X2 and X3. It was noted that X1, X2
and X3 uniformly blocked the L-type calcium current at
different levels of membrane potential in the order of
X1 > X2 >  X3, but did not change the maximum
activation potential and the reversal potential of the
calcium channels. These results implicated that X1,
X2 and X3 can block the L-type calcium channels in
rat ventricular myocytes. This was also in consistent
with the result of confocal laser scanning microscopy
in which X1, X2 and X3 lowered the concentration of
calcium in ventricular myocytes. This result suggested
that the underlying mechanism of vasodilation might
be related to the characteristics of the L-type calcium
channel blockers. To further confirm this, we compared
the inhibition of L-type calcium current between
X1, X2, X3 and classical calcium antagonists Ver

Inhibition of L-type calcium current in rat
myocardiocytes
In the current study, we observed that X1, X2 and
X3 (0.1 to 10 μM) reduced the amplitude of the L-type
calcium current in rat myocardiocytes (Figure 3).
The maximum inhibition rate was 97.2%, 82.8% and

0.524 uM respectively. It was showed that the IC50 of
X1 and X2 were less than that of Ver and Nif, and the
maximum inhibition rate of X1 was same as that of Ver,
maximum inhibition rate of X2 was almost the same as
that of Nif, while maximum inhibition rate of X3 was
weaker than that of Ver and Nif (Figure S2).

The automatic detection of Ca2+-CaM-CaV1.2
(preIQ-IQ motif) of the L-type calcium channel found
the binding sites AS1, AS2 and AS3, as well as their best
docking conformation of haloperidol derivatives (Figure 4).
The docking scores of each haloperidol derivative were
higher at the binding site AS1 than that in the others
(Table 2). These findings suggested that AS1 was the most
likely binding site of haloperidol derivatives and AS1 was
selected for the subsequent binding mode analysis. The
mode of binding of each haloperidol derivative to Ca2+CaM-CaV1.2 (preIQ-IQ motif) is shown in Figure 5A.

B. Being differ from X1 and X3,the A ring and D ring of
the compound X2 were located in the positively-charged
domain and involved in the cation-π interaction. The
positively-charged nitrogen of these three compounds had
a similar mode of interaction and was in close proximity
to the carboxyl group of C-chain Lys148, about 5.5Å in
distance, making a strong Coulomb force interaction. In
addition, the hydrogen bonding also played an important
role in the interaction of the haloperidol derivatives and
Ca2+-CaM-CaV1.2 (preIQ-IQ motif) as Figure 5B. These
results showed that X1, X2 and X3 had a strong interaction
with the important complex Ca2+-CaM-CaV1.2 (preIQ-IQ
motif) of L-type calcium channel. The affinity of the three

structure and activities, three new ones X1, X2 and X3
were synthesized. Compared  to previously synthesized
haloperidol derivatives, X1, X2 and X3 showed stronger
biological activity, and their water solubility increased.
In the present study, we investigated the side effects
of these molecules on the heart. Comparing with classical
calcium antagonists, although the potency of X1, X2 and
X3 is less than that of verapamil, these novel antagonists
neither caused tachycardia nor bradycardia. In contrast,
classical calcium antagonists, such as nifedipine activate the
sympathetic nervous system and cause tachycardia, while
verapamil and diltiazem cause bradycardia and conduction
block. Therefore classical calcium channel blockers were not
recommended for patients with heart failure, sinus node or
atrioventricular node dysfunction. Since X1, X2 and X3 had
little side effect on the heart and did not affect the diastolic
function, they could be widely used in clinical practice.
The model of KCl-induced aortic ring contraction
is the classic method in vitro for screening vasodilation
drugs. The present study showed that X1, X2 and X3 had

demonstrated that the contraction of vascular smooth
muscle is initiated by increased intracellular calcium
level [20–22], which may be achieved by two ways:
extracellular Ca2+ influx from voltage-depend calcium
channel (VDCCs) evoked by depolarization with high
potassium concentration and intracellular Ca2+ release
from intracellular storage [6, 23, 24]. It is known that
vasoconstriction induced by KCl (60 mM) was due to the
influx of extracellular Ca2+ [10]. The X1, X2 and X3 caused
the same vasoconstriction in both endothelium-intact
and endothelium-free rat aortic rings (data no shown). It
indicated that this kind of vasoconstriction was not related
to vasodilation factor NO of vascular endothelial cells
[12,  13], but related to the influx of extracellular Ca2+
which is induced by KCl (60 mM).
In order to study the effects of haloperidol
derivatives on extracellular calcium influx, the laser
scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) was used to
observe the changes of intracellular calcium concentration
after extracellular calcium influx. The results of the effect
on KCl-dependent Ca2+ signaling indicated that X1, X2
and X3 decreased the influx of extracellular Ca2+ caused
by depolarization in myocardial cell.
The extracellular calcium influx through the
voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel plays
the most important role in the regulation of a stable
level of free calcium in cells [21]. There are 6 types
of calcium channels, i.e. L, T, N, P, R, and Q types. In
myocardiocytes, L- and T-types are the most common
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ones [23]. L-type calcium channel is the main channel
responsible for extracellular calcium influx and cell
contraction [24]. L-type channel is particularly sensitive
to calcium channel blockers [25]. The whole cell patch
clamp recording is usually used to observe the electric
current of a certain type of ion channels carried on the
membrane. This technique is supposed to be the most
direct means to study the effects of drugs on the activity
of ion channel [26]. In the current study, we investigated
the L-type calcium current by setting the holding potential
to - 40 mV to exclude the impact of T-type calcium current
and sodium current. Tetraethyl ammonium was added in
the extracellular fluid and 4-AP in the pipette solution to
block the impacts of multiple types of potassium current.
The recorded current was blocked by the positive control
drug verapamil [27]. Our results demonstrated that the
underlying mechanism of vasodilation of X1, X2 and X3
was related to the characteristics of the L-type calcium
channel blockers.
We used H9c2 cell and calcium channel deleted
cells, the H9c2 cell (Cacnalc-/-) and performed the
hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) experiments. We observed
the changes of LDH which is a classic indicator of
myocardial cell injury under H/R. The result showed that
LDH decreased in in H9c2 cell, and remained unchanged
in Cacnalc-/- H9c2 cells upon treatment with X1, X2 and
X3. This result indicated that the effect of X1, X2 and X3
against injury under H/R was attributed to the blocking of
L-type calcium channel.

The effect of haloperidol derivatives on rat
hemodynamics

In order to analyze the mechanism for the inhibition
of L-type calcium channels by haloperidol derivatives, the
important regulatory complex Ca2+-CaM-CaV1.2 (preIQIQ motif) of the L-type calcium channel was selected
as the docking receptor, followed by molecular docking
analysis. The results showed that X1, X2, X3 had a strong
interaction with the important complex Ca2+-CaM-CaV1.2
(preIQ-IQ motif) of L-type calcium channel. Ca2+-CaM
and CaV1.2 interaction is a dual-direction regulation
on L-type calcium channel, including Ca2+-dependent
facilitation (CDF) and Ca2+-dependent inactivation
(CDI). Past studies reported that the CaV1.2 preIQ
interacting  with Ca2+-CaM involves in the regulation
of CDI [29–31]. The docking results showed that the
haloperidol derivatives stabilized the Ca2+-CaM/preIQ
complexes by hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonds,
so that Ca2+-CaM/preIQ complexes sustained the function
of CDI, thereby inhibiting extracellular calcium influx.
The docking results showed that the affinity of the three
haloperidol derivatives to Ca2+-CaM-CaV1.2(preIQ-IQ
motif) was in the order of X1 > X2 > X3. Accordingly, the
effects of these three haloperidol derivatives on L-type
calcium channels were X1 > X2 > X3.
In summary, the N-methoxy-benzyl haloperidol
quaternary ammonium derivatives are a structurally
novel class of calcium antagonists. They reduced the
concentration of intracellular calcium by inhibiting
extracellular calcium influx. The SAR of result showed
that the activities of X1, X2 and X3 were closely related to
the interactions between the compounds and the L-type
calcium channel proteins. The findings of this study
provide a new idea for developing a structurally novel
class of calcium antagonists with less cardiac side effects.

SD rats of either sex weighing between 220–250 g
were anesthetized with intravenous pentobarbital
sodium (30 mg/kg). A cannula were linked to a pressure
transducer  (PT14M2, Fudan university, China) filled
with 40 IU/ml of sodium heparin. It was inserted into
the femoral artery to monitor mean arterial pressure and
inserted into the left ventricle through right common
carotid artery to measure the left ventricular pressure.
The changes of hemodynamics, including left ventricular
systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure (LVEDP), ± dP/dtmax and heart rate (HR) were
recorded with MS302 recording-and-analyzing system
software (Guangdong Medicine College, China) at
baseline and 3 min after administration of drugs.

Vasodilation activity on rat aortic ring
The vasodilation activity of compounds was
evaluated in isolated rat thoracic aortic rings according
to the methods of Greenwood and Polster et al [9, 10].
The aortic rings were allowed to equilibrate in Krebs
bicarbonate solution ((PSS), containing118.0 mM NaCl,
4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4.7H2O,
5.0  mM glucose, 25.0 mM NaHCO3, and 2.5 mM
CaCl2.7H2O at 37°C and were gassed with 95% O2 and
5% CO2 for 90 min at a testing tension. KCl (60 mM) was
used to depolarize the aortic rings. When the amplitude of
the contraction reached a plateau, compounds X1, X2, X3
were added. Cumulative concentration-response curves
to all compounds were determined in the absence and
presence of endothelium. Using tips of forceps, the
endothelium was mechanically removed from some rings
by gently rubbing the lumen, if absence of endothelium is
needed. Acetylcholine was used to confirm the removal of
endothelium from the aortic rings [11].

Inhibition of KCl-induced rat myocardial
extracellular calcium influx

The heating reflux equipment was from Dafeng
glassware Co., Ltd, China. It consisted of a heater, an
evaporator, a condenser and a cooler. Haloperidol (10 mM)
was dissolved in the corresponding benzyl chloride
(4 ml). The mixture was heated in an oil bath for 24 h
to maintain reflux and then cooled to room temperature.
The filtered solid was recrystallized from an ethanolwater mixed solvent to a crystalline product. 1H NMR
spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 spectrometer
(400 MHz) (Bruker, Switzerland). Yields are within 90%
of the theoretical values. The purity of all compounds
were  determined to be about 95% using analytical
reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC) (Waters 600 / 2478, USA) and detected with
MS for details. No UV-active impurities were observed at
245 nm with RP-HPLC-UV.

Fluorescence intensity of Ca2+ in myocardial cell
was determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy
(ACAS/ULTIMA312, Meridian Instruments) as previously
described [12]. Rat myocardiocytes were grown on 24-mm
glass coverslips in 6-well plates in DMEM containing
10% FBS. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with Fluo
3-AM (20 μM ) for 60 min in the dark at 37°C. Then,
the cells were washed with HBSS three times to remove
extracellular Fluo 3-AM. HBSS (HEPES-buffered

The computer-fitting molecular docking with
L-type channel proteins

monitored at 530 nm. KCl was added into the cultured
cells to induce the influx of extracellular Ca2+ in HBSS and
changes in fluorescence were recorded. Myocardiocytes
were incubated for 30 min with 0.1,  1, and 10 μM
compounds before adding KCl. Effect of compounds on
KCl-induced changes in fluorescence was investigated.

Ligands and receptors
X-ray crystal structures of these three haloperidol
derivatives were used as initial structures for molecular
structure optimization. The optimization of the
molecules was carried out using a Powell method with
a convergence limit of 0.05 kcal/mol/Å. The Tripos
force field and Gasteiger–Hückel partial charges were
applied in the calculations. Then a molecular database of
haloperidol derivatives was set up. The crystal structure
of Ca2+-CaM/CaV1.2 (preIQ-IQ motif) complex was
downloaded from the Protein Database Bank (PDB ID:
3G43). Removing chain A and waters, the complex
was prepared by adding terminators, hydrogen, charges
and fixing side chains using the Biopolymer Structure
Preparation Tool in SYBYL X 1.2. The structure of
complex was optimized using the Powell method and
with a convergence limit of 0.05 kcal/mol/Å. Amber
FF99 and Amber partial charges were applied for
calculations.

Inhibition of L-type calcium current in rat
Myocardiocytes
The patch-clamp technique in the perforatedattached configuration [13] was used to study Inward
barium (IBa) currents in single cells. Records were made
using a Biologic RK-300 amplifier, filtered (23 dB,
5-pole Tchebicheff filter) at 1 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz.
Currents were recorded from holding potential 240 mV
during linear voltage ramps from 240 to +60 mV, with
10 mV increments. Patch pipettes filled with the pipette
solution containing 125 mM NaCl, 10.8 mM BaCl2,
1.0  mM MgCl2, 5.4 mM CsCl, 10 mM glucose, and
10 mM Hepes, pH = 7.4. The electrode resistance ranged
from 2–5 MV. Drugs were applied in the bath solution.
The final concentration of ethanol and the diluent was
0.1% (v/v). The pClamp 8.1 software (Axon Instruments)
was used for sampling and data analysis.

Molecular docking
Molecular docking was performed using the
Surflex-Dock algorithm, which is available in the
SYBYL X 1.2. Surflex-Dock is a fast, flexible docking
method that employs an idealized active site ligand
(called protomol) as a target for generating putative
poses of molecules. These putative poses are scored
using the Hammerhead scoring function. The scoring
function contains the hydrophobic, polar, repulsive,
entropic, solvation and crash terms. The scores are
expressed in units of –log(Kd) to represent binding
affinities. The binding sites of haloperidol derivatives
were detected automatically by Surflex-Dock. After
generation of protomols, the Surflex-Dock Geom X
mode was applied to perform a high precision docking,
leveled all parameters in their default values. The
docked poses with the highest docking scores were
selected for further analysis of binding modes.

Measurements of Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
in myocardiocytes culture medium
Myocardiocytes H9c2 cell and the one which
the L-type calcium channel gene was knock-out, the
H9c2 (Cacnalc-/-) were incubated separately in culture
plates. When cell confluence reached 85%, the cells
were incubated for another 12 hours in DMEM medium
with 0.5% FBS. Then cells were randomly divided into
6 groups, namely the control group, H/R group, DMSO
group, H/R+X1(1 × 10-6 mol/L) group, H/R+X2 (1 × 10-6
mol/L) group and H/R+X3 (1 × 10-6 mol/L) group. The
hypoxic DMEM culture medium and reoxygenation
medium were used in H/R process. The final volume was
500 uL. The compounds (X1,X2,X3) were administered
continuously during the hypoxia/reoxygenation process.
Finally, cell supernatant was collected and LDH was
measured by colorimetric method according to the Kit
instruction by manufacturer (Nanjin Jiancheng Lit. China).
