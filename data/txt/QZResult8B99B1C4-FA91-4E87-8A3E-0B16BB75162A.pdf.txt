Abstract
Structural and functional abnormalities in tumor blood vessels impact the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to
solid tumors, resulting in chronic and cycling hypoxia. Although chronically hypoxic regions exhibit treatment
resistance, more recently it has been shown that cycling hypoxic regions acquire prosurvival pathways.
Angiogenesis inhibitors have been shown to transiently normalize the tumor vasculatures and enhance tumor
response to treatments. However, the effect of antiangiogenic therapy on cycling tumor hypoxia remains
unknown. Using electron paramagnetic resonance imaging and MRI in tumor-bearing mice, we have examined
the vascular renormalization process by longitudinally mapping tumor partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and
microvessel density during treatments with a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. Transient improvement
in tumor oxygenation was visualized by electron paramagnetic resonance imaging 2 to 4 days following
antiangiogenic treatments, accompanied by a 45% decrease in microvessel density. Radiation treatment during
this time period of improved oxygenation by antiangiogenic therapy resulted in a synergistic delay in tumor
growth. In addition, dynamic oxygen imaging obtained every 3 minutes was conducted to distinguish tumor
regions with chronic and cycling hypoxia. Sunitinib treatment suppressed the extent of temporal fluctuations in
tumor pO2 during the vascular normalization window, resulting in the decrease of cycling tumor hypoxia.
Overall, the findings suggest that longitudinal and noninvasive monitoring of tumor pO2 makes it possible to
identify a window of vascular renormalization to maximize the effects of combination therapy with antiangiogenic drugs. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6350–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Tumors can grow up to 2 to 3 mm3 in size by relying on
passive supplies of nutrients and oxygen. For further growth,
tumors activate angiogenesis pathways to develop new
vascular networks (1). In normal processes such as wound
healing, angiogenesis is tightly regulated and creates a
balance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors. However

in tumors, the balance is tilted toward promoting angiogenesis, causing the development of architecturally and
functionally abnormal vasculature (2, 3). The aberrant tumor
blood vessel is neither as efficient nor well organized in
delivering oxygen and nutrients (4–6). The consequent hypoxic and acidotic microenvironment diminishes tumor
responsiveness to treatments (7).
Tumor hypoxia can be categorized into 2 types: chronic or
cycling hypoxia. Chronic hypoxia exists in tumor regions
beyond the diffusion distance of oxygen. Longitudinal oxygen gradient, where the vascular oxygen concentration
remains low, in tumor blood vessels makes the radial oxygen
diffusion distance shortened, leading to chronic hypoxia (8).
Cycling hypoxia, also known as acute or intermittent hypoxia, has been attributed to fluctuations in tumor perfusion
and erythrocyte flux (9, 10). Chaplin and colleagues reported
in preclinical studies that at least 20% of solid tumor cells
experience cycling hypoxia (11). One consequence of cycling
hypoxia is increased resistance to treatments by conferring
tumor cells and endothelial cells of tumor blood vessels with
enhanced prosurvival pathways (12, 13). These observations
make cycling hypoxia a common hallmark existing in a
tumor microenvironment. Baudelet and colleagues have
noninvasively observed the characteristic fluctuations of
transversal relaxation time (T2*)-weighted MRI signal in
solid tumors attributed to physiologic noise that in turn

may correlate with instability of tumor oxygenation (14).
These fluctuations were suppressed by treatments including
carbogen combined with nicotinamide and flunarizine. Although the signal interpretation of T2*-weighted MRI is
complex with regard to the absolute value of partial pressure
of oxygen (pO2), such noninvasive and longitudinal imaging
approaches to study the temporal dynamics of pO2 would be
useful to identify effective treatments targeting cycling
tumor hypoxia.
Antiangiogenic drugs have been shown to exhibit efficacy in
selectively destroying tumor blood vessels in experimental
animals and in humans (1). Although as a monotherapy,
antiangiogenic agents yielded modest success in human trials,
they are being explored in combination therapies with cytotoxic cancer therapies (15, 16). Although decrease in delivery
of oxygen and therapeutics to the tumor should be expected
on antiangiogenic treatments, numerous reports point to the
significant benefit in patient survival when used with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, suggesting an improvement of tumor
oxygenation and perfusion (17–19). To explain this paradox,
Jain and colleagues put forward a hypothesis that tumor
vasculature transiently normalizes during the course of antiangiogenic treatments, where the immature and ineffective
vessels get pruned, making the residual vessels structurally
competent with improved function (20). Further research
was carried out to serially monitor changes in the vascular
normalization process that identify a window, in which
chemotherapy or radiotherapy was delivered with maximal
therapeutic gain (17, 21, 22). A major challenge identified in
this effort is the development of noninvasive imaging biomarkers of the vascular normalization process in tumors (20).
Optimization of antiangiogenic therapies is complicated by
the fact that these agents are not directly cytotoxic to malignant cells, making tumor growth kinetics an unreliable approach to identify the vascular normalization window (23).
Useful criteria for an imaging modality would be noninvasive
and capable of longitudinally monitoring tumor physiology
and would provide a surrogate quantitative biomarker for
tumor blood flow/perfusion (18, 20, 22).
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a spectroscopic
technique similar to nuclear MRI but detects paramagnetic
species. Recent availability of triarylmethyl (TAM) radical
derivatives as in vivo compatible paramagnetic tracers made
EPR imaging (EPRI) capable of mapping tissue pO2 (24, 25).
The sequential imaging with EPRI for tissue oxygen and
conventional MRI for anatomy in a system operating at a
common resonance frequency provides anatomically overlaid pO2 maps with tumor microvessel density maps (25). In
the present study, we report the results from the imaging
experiments monitoring tumor pO2 to identify the tumor
vascular renormalization window and optimize sequence of
combination therapy of antiangiogenic drugs and radiation.
The normalization window in tumor oxygenation in
response to antiangiogenic treatment was noninvasively
visualized, and radiation treatment during this narrow time
period resulted in synergistic tumor growth delay. Furthermore, the temporal resolution of EPRI made it feasible to
obtain 3-dimensional (3D) pO2 maps every 2to 3 minutes

and enabled to distinguish the phenomenon of cycling
hypoxia (12, 26). The results show that the consequence
of sunitinib treatment is a decrease in the extent of cycling
hypoxia in tumors.

Materials and Methods
Tumor implantation
We established SCCVII tumors (obtained from Dr. T.
Phillips, UCSF, San Francisco, CA, and was tested in 2011
by RADIL using a panel of microsatellite markers) in mouse
hind leg as described previously (25). Tumor-bearing female
C3H mice were treated daily with oral administration of 50mg sunitinib (LC Laboratories) per kg body weight 6 or
10 days after tumor implantation. X-ray irradiation (10 Gy)
was delivered 6 or 10 days after tumor implantation using an
X-RAD 320 (Precision X-ray Inc.) with or without pretreatment of sunitinib. We carried out all our procedures in
compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animal Resources (27), and experimental protocols were
approved by the National Cancer Institute Animal Care
and Use Committee.
EPRI for pO2
Technical details of the EPR scanner and oxygen image
reconstruction were described in Supplementary Data S1.
Parallel coil resonators tuned to 300 MHz were used for EPRI
and MRI. After the animal was placed in the resonator, TAM
(1.125 mmol/kg bolus) was injected intravenously under isoflurane anesthesia. The repetition time was 6.0 microseconds.
The free induction decay (FID) signals were collected following the radiofrequency excitation pulses under a nested looping of the x, y, and z gradients and each time point in the FID
underwent phase modulation enabling 3D spatial encoding.
Because FIDs last for 1 to 5 microseconds, it is possible to
generate a sequence of T2* maps, that is, EPR line width maps,
which linearly correlate with local concentration of oxygen
and allows pixel-wise estimation of pO2.
MRI for anatomy and blood volume
MRI scans were conducted using a 7T scanner (Bruker
BioSpin MRI GmbH). T2*-weighted anatomic images were
obtained using a fast spin echo sequence (RARE) with an
echo time of 13 milliseconds, repetition time of 2,500 milliseconds, RARE factor 8, and resolution of 0.125  0.125 mm.
For convenience of coregistration with EPRI, all MRI images
had the same slice thickness of 2 mm and field of view of
3.2 cm with 16 slices or 2.8 cm field of view with 14 slices. For
blood volume calculation, spoiled gradient echo sequence
images were collected before and 5 minutes after ultrasmall
superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO; BioPAL Inc., colloidal
size of 30 nanoseconds) injection (1.2 mL/g body weight) with
the following parameters: matrix ¼ 256  256; echo time ¼ 5.4
milliseconds; and repetition time ¼ 250 milliseconds. The
percentage of tumor blood volume was estimated as described
previously (28). Coregistration of EPRI and MRI images was
accomplished using code written in MATLAB (MathWorks) as
described previously (25).

Immunohistochemical analysis
Tumor tissues were excised on hour after intravenous
injection of a pimonidazole (60 mg/kg). Tumor tissues were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and frozen, and 10 mm thick
sections were obtained. After blocking nonspecific binding
sites, the slides were covered by CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences; 1:250) combined with aSMA antibody (Abcam Inc.;
1:250) or rabbit anti-pimonidazole antisera (Natural Pharmacia International, Inc.; 1:250) overnight at 4 C. The sections
were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rat and Alexa Fluor
555 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen; 1:500).

Statistical analysis
All results were expressed as the mean  SEM. The differences in means of groups were determined by the Student t
test. The minimum level of significance was set at P < 0.05.

EPR line width distribution of TAM, an in vivo pO2 map can be
generated where TAM is present at detectable levels (25).
Figure 1A (top) shows anatomic images taken on days 8, 10,
and 12 and an image representing the microvessel density
(MRI) taken on day 12 of a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
tumor–bearing control (untreated) mouse. The corresponding
pO2 maps from the same time points are shown in Fig. 1A
(bottom), along with an independent immunohistochemical
analysis of microvessel density (CD31, green) and pericytes
(aSMA, red). Longitudinal pO2 imaging showed that the
extent of hypoxia increased with tumor size. The hypoxic
fraction (pO2 <10 mmHg) was 24.2%  6.8% on day 8 and
increased to 40.9%  6.1% and 47.4%  8.3% on days 10 and
12, respectively. Blood volume images obtained by MRI using
the blood pool contrast agent USPIO as an in vivo marker of

microvessel density (28) showed substantial vascularization in
this tumor. However, immunohistochemical analyses indicated that the tumor blood vessels had inadequate pericyte
coverage, suggesting inefficient oxygen delivery by these vessels (4, 6), consistent with the hypoxic nature of this tumor.
Early treatment with an antiangiogenic drug delays
progression of tumor hypoxia
In earlier preclinical studies with antiangiogenic drugs, a
renormalization of tumor vasculature along with a transient
improvement in oxygen status was observed (17, 22). We
hypothesized that if the vascular normalization is occurred
by sunitinib treatment, tumor oxygenation improves simultaneously with reduced vascular microvessel density under
the assumption of unchanged cellular oxygen consumption.
To noninvasively study this phenomenon, daily sunitinib

treatment was initiated at an early stage before tumors became
hypoxic (6 days after SCC tumor implantation, hypoxic fraction
<3%). In mice receiving early antiangiogenic treatment initiation, sunitinib significantly delayed the SCC tumor growth
(Fig. 1B). When the pO2 status and microvessel density were
evaluated by consecutive EPRI and MRI scans, a different
pattern emerged. The pO2 levels in treated tumors were
transiently higher than in untreated mice (P < 0.01) followed
by a monotonous decrease (Fig. 1C), whereas approximately
40% reduction in the microvessel density as assessed by MRI
(Fig. 1D) and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1B, bottom) was
observed after 2 to 6 days of sunitinib treatment. The increase
in tumor pO2, which was accompanied by a decrease in
microvascular density, after sunitinib treatment compared
with untreated controls may be attributed to a phenomenon
known as transient vascular renormalization, where the delivery of nutrients including oxygen improves as a result of
pruning immature blood vessels and the subsequent recruitment of pericytes (19, 22). Further continuation of sunitinib
treatment resulted in hypovascularity for up to 2 weeks after
initiating treatment, at which time the tumors became severely
hypoxic compared with the size-matched control tumors.
Antiangiogenic treatment at a later stage improves
tumor oxygenation by vascular normalization
In addition to vascular normalization, sunitinib-induced
suppression of tumor growth might contribute to the improved

tumor oxygenation. To investigate this, sunitinib treatment
was initiated at a later stage (SCC day 10), when the tumors
became significantly hypoxic (hypoxic fraction 35%). Figure 2
shows images of tumor pO2 and microvessel density from SCC
tumors treated with sunitinib 10 days after tumor implantation. day 0 corresponds to images before treatment. The other
images were taken on days 2 and 4 after initiating sunitinib
treatment. Even in this tumor, which had significant hypoxic
regions, tumor oxygen levels increased 2 and 4 days after
sunitinib treatment compared with oxygen level before treatment (Fig. 2A, top). It should be noted that no significant
change in tumor size occurred during these time points (835 
44 mm3 before treatment and 822  89.5 mm3 4 days after
treatment), despite a 45% reduction in tumor blood volume
[Fig. 2A (bottom) and E]. In frequency histograms of this tumor,
a right shift of tumor pO2 was observed (Fig. 2B) with a
concomitant left shift of the blood vessel density (Fig. 2C).
The transient increase in tumor pO2 was quantified (Fig. 2D), as
was the loss in microvessel density (Fig. 2E).
In 2 instances (Figs. 2A and 3A), the tumor size and shape
difference between before and 4 days after sunitinib treatment
were less than 3%. This permitted monitoring individual
voxel-based changes in pO2 (Fig. 3A) and blood volume
(Fig. 3B) before and after sunitinib treatment. In the scatter
plot of data from these 2 experiments (Fig. 3C), a left shift of
the data in each row from the untreated (left column) to
the treated (right column) indicates a decrease in tumor

microvessel density and an upward shift of the data from the
left column to the right column in each row would indicate an
improvement in tumor pO2. The analyzed data were classified
into 4 groups on the basis of pO2 levels before and after
sunitinib treatment as follows: (i) pO2 levels more than 10 mm
Hg before and after treatment (black circles), which may
represent tumor regions that are normoxic and covered with
functional vessels; (ii) pO2 levels less than 10 mm Hg before
and after sunitinib treatment, which may represent hypoxic
regions whose vasculature was not responsive to sunitinib
treatment (red circles); (iii) pO2 levels less than 10 mm Hg
before and more than 10 mm Hg after sunitinib treatment
(blue circles), which may represent regions with normalized
vasculature after sunitinib treatment; and (iv) pO2 levels more
than 10 mm Hg before and less than 10 mm Hg after sunitinib
treatment (green circles), regions where sunitinib may have
destroyed the vasculature substantially such that the effect of
the hypovasculature may have overwhelmed the beneficial
effect of vascular normalization. The results from mouse 1 (the
same mouse shown in Fig. 2) showed that a significant fraction
of pixels in the tumor that was hypoxic before sunitinib

treatment (blue circles) displayed pO2 increase to a level more
than 10 mm Hg with a concomitant decrease in blood vessel
density. In addition, the average pO2 values of all groups
showed an increase, suggesting a global vascular normalization in the tumor (Supplementary Data S2). Similar results
were observed in mouse 2 (Fig. 3C), but the improvement in
tumor pO2 was relatively limited and also some regions of
significant hypoxia were established after treatment (green
circles).
Vascular normalization with sunitinib increases oxygen
diffusion distance and reduces hypoxic fraction in
tumors
The noninvasive observation of transiently improved tumor
oxygenation by EPRI after antiangiogenic treatment was
further validated by histologic analysis. Immunohistochemical
evaluation of pimonidazole (Fig. 4A), a hypoxia marker, shows
that the hypoxic fraction of SCC tumors decreased by 9% and
7% after 4 days of sunitinib treatment initiated at days 6 and
10, respectively. Microvascular density (CD31 staining, Fig. 4B)
decreased 40% 4 days after sunitinib treatment, whereas no

significant change was observed in the number of pericytes
(aSMA, Fig. 4C). The average distance between microvessels
(CD31) and the edge of hypoxic regions (pimonidazole) was
measured to represent oxygen gradient distance and was
determined to be 75 mm in untreated control tumors, which
increased to 110 mm 4 days after sunitinib treatment (Fig. 4B
and C). These histologic results are consistent with previous
observations and support noninvasive assessment of transient
vascular normalization and resultant improvement of tumor
oxygenation after antiangiogenic treatment.
Transient increase in tumor oxygenation by
antiangiogenic treatment enhances outcome of
radiotherapy
As hypoxic cells show resistance to radiation, a transient
increase in tumor oxygenation has a potential to improve
treatment effect of radiation. A combination of 10 Gy radiation
at the end of 4 days sunitinib treatment synergistically delayed
the tumor growth (8 days) compared with monotherapy of
radiation (2-day delay) or 4 days of sunitinib treatment (2-day
delay, Fig. 5). Collectively, microenvironmental changes resulting from normalization of tumor blood vessels by antiangiogenic treatment contributed to the augmented efficacy of
radiotherapy during the window of improved tumor oxygenation that can be directly monitored with EPRI.
Vascular normalization with sunitinib suppresses
cycling hypoxia
In recent studies (12, 26), the temporal fluctuations of
tumor pO2 in the various tumor subregions were examined
to distinguish chronically hypoxic tumor regions from transiently hypoxic regions, a phenomenon known as cycling
hypoxia. It was found that there was a significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the dynamics of tumor pO2. To examine
the effect of antiangiogenic agents in modifying these spatiotemporal fluctuations in tumor pO2, dynamic oxygen imaging
experiments were carried out in treated and untreated mice.
Figure 6A shows a series of snapshot EPRI images taken every
3 minutes over a period of 30 minutes in untreated animals.
For the 4 regions of interest (ROI), marked ROI-1 to ROI-4, the
temporal pO2 changes are displayed in Fig. 6B. The results
show that there were no significant temporal fluctuations in

ROI-2, typical of chronically hypoxic regions, whereas ROIs 1, 3,
and 4 displayed features characteristic of cycling hypoxia, with
pO2 fluctuations of approximately 20 mm Hg were noticed.
When similar experiments were carried out on sunitinibtreated animals and the various ROIs examined (Fig. 6C), it
can be seen that in addition to the chronically hypoxic region,
ROI-2, which displays steady levels of pO2 less than 10 mmHg,
ROIs 1, 3, and 4 show an improved and more stable pO2 levels
(Fig. 6D). Similar results were obtained in 4 independent mice
for both untreated and sunitinib-treated groups. Figure 6E
shows SDs of tumor pO2 (pO2 SD) maps of the treated and
untreated mice calculated from the 10 images taken in the 30minute time window. This parametric image can visualize the
locations and extent of temporal pO2 fluctuations, and regions
with high pO2 SD (>6 mmHg) were observed in the large
majority of untreated tumors whereas limited area of high
pO2 SD in sunitinib-treated tumors. Averaged pO2 SD values in
tumor regions decreased by 25% 4 days after sunitinib treatment compared with size-matched untreated control tumors
(Fig. 6E, right). This observation from EPRI experiments provides new information that the vascular normalization by
antiangiogenic treatment minimizes cycling hypoxia resulting
from temporal pO2 instability.

Discussion
The transient vascular normalization resulting from
antiangiogenic cancer treatments presents a window of opportunity to augment treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy to realize additive or synergistic responses in
treatment (20–22). Noninvasive imaging biomarkers that
can quantitatively and longitudinally monitor physiologic
changes in tumor microenvironment in response to antiangiogenic therapies will be of significant value where the classic
endpoints in cancer treatment such as tumor shrinkage may
not apply (23, 29). Such capabilities will be especially useful
when planning combination therapies (1, 22). By using the
image contrast provided by molecular oxygen to a paramagnetic tracer such as TAM, EPRI can provide quantitative maps
of tissue pO2, a key determinant of radiotherapy. Anatomic
guidance with MRI allows the spatial coregistration of tissue/
tumor oxygenation in a straight forward manner (25).

Sunitinib Suppresses Cycling Tumor Hypoxia

The results from the present imaging and histologic studies
show that, after starting sunitinib treatment, there is a time
window when tumor oxygenation in treated mice is significantly
higher than in the untreated controls. The improved oxygenation, which is accompanied by a decrease in blood vessel
density, suggests that the residual blood vessels had improved
function in terms of delivering oxygen and nutrients, in agreement with earlier reports (17, 22, 30). Interestingly, Ansiaux and
colleagues reported that antiangiogenic drugs SU5416 and
vandetanib increased tumor oxygenation by a decrease in
oxygen consumption (31, 32). Such other mechanism of transient increase in tumor oxygenation may be also involved in the
case of sunitinib and further investigations remain required.
Even when sunitinib treatment was started at a later stage in the
tumor growth where there is already significant hypoxia, a
similar profile of improved oxygenation was observed. The large
proportion of hypoxic tumor regions that became oxygenated
after sunitinib treatment (blue circles in Fig. 3C) represent
tumor regions that can be expected to be responsive to radiotherapy. In addition, a synergistic delay in tumor growth was
observed when radiation was delivered during the improved
tumor oxygenation after 4 days of sunitinib administration

(Fig. 5). These results support the capability of EPRI to longitudinally and noninvasively visualize tumor pO2, allowing us to
monitor and adjust the impact of antiangiogenic drugs on
individual tumors and optimize benefit of combined therapy
of antiangiogenesis and other treatments.
Cycling hypoxia is now a well-recognized hallmark of solid
tumors (9, 12). The cycle of hypoxia/normoxia induces accumulation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 in both
tumor cells as well as supporting endothelial cells, promotes
cancer cell phenotypes with enhanced prosurvival pathways,
and acquires resistance to therapy with increased malignant
potential (13, 33, 34). However, until now, treatments currently
did not consider the existence of cycling hypoxia, nor examine
the consequence of antiangiogenic agents on cycling tumor
hypoxia. The phenomenon of cycling hypoxia has been originally observed as a consequence of radiobiological experiments and investigated in detail using histologic approaches
and subsequent window-chamber experiments (9, 33). Because a priori knowledge of location and frequency of cycling
hypoxia may help plan the treatment regimens, noninvasive
imaging techniques are being actively explored to monitor this
phenomenon with required spatial and temporal resolutions

(12). EPRI provided a noninvasive capability to obtain 3D pO2
maps within 3 minutes. Serial oxygen mapping with EPRI in a
time window of 30 minutes enabled to spatially distinguish
cycling hypoxic regions from chronically hypoxia regions in the
tumors (26). To quantitatively visualize the extent of cycling
hypoxia, the parametric image (SD of pO2 map) was calculated
from 10 individual images in 30-minute time window. The
results in this study show, for the first time, that cycling hypoxia
in tumors can be suppressed by sunitinib. Thus antiangiogenic
treatment might, in addition to its well-known modes of action
alone or in combination therapy, prevent prosurvival pathways
that can be acquired by cycling hypoxia.
Jain and colleagues reported that the combination of MRIbased parameters with circulating collagen IV can predict
survival of glioblastoma patients after anti-VEGF treatment
(30). Combination of such blood markers with the pO2 and
blood vessel density values may improve the accuracy of
these types of predictions. The present study showed that
the methodology developed here has the capability to noninvasively and longitudinally monitor spatial and temporal
changes in tumor pO2 before and after antiangiogenesis
treatment and to successfully visualize the improvement in

cycling hypoxia during the vascular normalization window,
which results in enhanced efficacy of combined radiation
therapy. EPRI can use the experience from MRI to scale up
for human use, making it a promising modality for integration
into clinical settings.
