Current and Emerging Targeted Therapies
for Metastatic Breast Cancer
Edith A. Perez, MD1 and Jean-Philippe Spano, MD, PhD2

The success of endocrine therapies for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and trastuzumab and lapatinib for
targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumors has paved the way for the clinical development of several other metastatic breast cancer (MBC)-targeted therapies. Although the benefit of the anti-VEGF
(vascular endothelial growth factor) monoclonal antibody bevacizumab in the MBC setting has become a topic of
debate, clinical trial results are accumulating, and phase 3 evaluations are ongoing for newer HER2-targeted agents
(pertuzumab and trastuzumab-maytansine immunoconjugate) and VEGF-targeted agents (aflibercept), as well as
dual, epidermal growth factor receptor/HER2-targeted agents (afatinib [BIBW 2992] and neratinib), multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib and pazopanib), and mammalian target of rapamycin (everolimus) and poly (ADPribose) polymerase 1 inhibitors (iniparib, olaparib). These agents as well as other novel classes of anticancer agents
are being tested in clinical trials with the potential of addressing unmet therapeutic needs in the MBC patient populaC 2011 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in developed and developing countries, although incidence is
much higher in the developed world.1 However, mortality rates are higher in the developing world,1 possibly because of
lack of affordability for treatment and lower access to mammography screening and tumor-receptor testing.2 In the
United States, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women, with a 5-year survival rate of only 23%
for patients diagnosed with distant metastases.3 This review focuses on the development of new targeted therapies with the
potential to improve these outcomes.
Evolving Management of Metastatic Breast Cancer
Numerous single-agent and combination chemotherapy regimens have activity against metastatic breast cancer (MBC),4 a
biologically heterogeneous disease for which molecular characteristics have been identified to further guide therapy. Several receptors whose downstream signaling mediators promote proliferation and cell survival are routinely screened in all
patients with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer. These include 2 hormone receptors, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor, and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).4 Triple-negative breast cancer, a breast cancer subtype clinically negative for ER, progesterone receptor, and HER2, is associated with poorer clinical outcomes and
accounts for about 15% of all breast cancers.5 Up to 10% of breast cancers are because of specific hereditary mutations in
single genes such as breast cancer genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, which encode proteins involved in DNA repair.5 Historically,
patients harboring BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are more likely to have triple-negative disease and have not received

individualized treatment, but recent research suggests that
agents targeting DNA repair mechanisms may provide
greater therapeutic activity in this subset of patients.5
HER2-targeted therapy

HER2, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor
belonging to the family of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), is overexpressed in approximately 15% to
20% of breast cancers, is associated with poor clinical outcome,6 and is more common in younger patients.7 For
patients with HER2-positive tumors, trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif) as a single
agent or in combination with chemotherapy has demonstrated efficacy, with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as a
standard first-line treatment option for patients with
HER2-positive MBC.4,8-10 For HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive disease, initial treatment with endocrine therapy should be considered for patients without
visceral crisis or with symptomatic metastases.4
For patients with breast cancer whose disease progresses with trastuzumab or who develop metastatic disease after adjuvant trastuzumab, continuing HER2targeted therapy has demonstrated benefit.11,12 Lapatinib
(Tykerb; GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK), a reversible inhibitor of EGFR/HER1 and HER2,13 is approved for use
with capecitabine for treating HER2-positive MBC after
chemotherapy and trastuzumab failure. Approval was
based on interim analysis of 324 patients in a phase 3 trial
of lapatinib in HER2-positive advanced disease progressing after anthracycline/taxane/trastuzumab-based therapies, showing that adding lapatinib to capecitabine
significantly prolongs median time to progression (TTP)
versus capecitabine alone (8.4 vs 4.4 months; P < .001).14
In another phase 3 study (N ¼ 580), 86 patients with
HER2-positive MBC receiving first-line lapatinib/paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone had significant improvements
in the primary endpoint of TTP (median, 36.4 vs 25.1
weeks; P ¼ .005) and secondary endpoints of response
rate (RR; RR ¼ complete response [CR] þ partial
response [PR]; 63.3% vs 37.8%; P ¼ .023) and clinical
benefit rate (69.4% vs 40.5%; P ¼ .011), benefits that
were not observed among the subset with HER2-negative
disease.15 In a phase 3 comparison of lapatinib plus letrozole (Femara; Novartis, Cambridge, Mass) versus letrozole alone in hormone receptor-positive MBC (N ¼
1286), lapatinib/letrozole recipients with HER2-positive
disease had significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS; median, 8.2 vs 3.0 months; P ¼ .019), RR
(28% vs 15%, P ¼ .021), and clinical benefit rate (48% vs
Cancer

29%; P ¼ .003), with similar outcomes between the study
regimens in the HER2-negative subset.16
Combining lapatinib with trastuzumab has also
shown activity in trastuzumab-refractory MBC.17 In an
open-label phase 3 trial of 296 trastuzumab-pretreated
patients, lapatinib/trastuzumab significantly prolonged
PFS (median, 12.0 vs 8.1 weeks; P ¼ .008), the primary
endpoint, and clinical benefit rate (24.7% vs 12.4%; P ¼
.01), the secondary endpoint. The combination was associated with numerically but not significantly increased RR
(10.3% [15 of 146] vs 6.9% [10 of 145]; P ¼ .46) and
overall survival (OS; median, 51.6 vs 39.0 weeks; P ¼
.106), both secondary endpoints. In the Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Optimization (ALTTO;
NCT00490139) trial, lapatinib and trastuzumab are
being evaluated alone, in combination, and sequentially,
as adjuvant therapy. In addition, preliminary data from
the NeoALTTO trial of neoadjuvant lapatinib/trastuzumab/paclitaxel, trastuzumab/paclitaxel, and lapatinib/
paclitaxel show a significant improvement in the lapatinib/trastuzumab combination arm compared with either
targeted agent plus paclitaxel (P < .01 for each); both
studies will prospectively investigate potential biomarkers
(eg, v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog,
p95HER2, phosphatase and tensin homolog) for their
value in predicting response to lapatinib and
trastuzumab.18
Cardiac toxicity emerged as an unexpected trastuzumab-associated toxicity. In a meta-analysis of phase 3 clinical trials of adjuvant trastuzumab for early stage breast
cancer, there were significantly increased risks of grade
III/IV congestive heart failure (CHF; 1.61% absolute
increase; P < .00001) and asymptomatic left ventricular
ejection fraction reduction (7.20% absolute increase; P <
.00001).19 In a pooled analysis of 3689 lapatinib recipients (including 2275 patients [62%] with advanced breast
cancer) across 44 clinical trials in which it was given as
monotherapy or combined with endocrine therapy,
chemotherapy, or trastuzumab (taxane), a total of 62
cardiac events occurred among 60 patients, for a 1.6%
incidence overall that was similar to the 0.7% incidence
for the nonlapatinib control arms.20 The symptomatic
CHF and asymptomatic cardiac event rates among lapatinib-treated patients were low at 0.2% and 1.4%, respectively. Long-term follow-up is necessary to better
characterize the safety risks associated with lapatinib therapy. In addition, the abovementioned meta-analysis of
phase 3 trials also found an increase in the incidence of
brain metastases with adjuvant trastuzumab (0.62

absolute increase; P ¼ .033).19 It has been hypothesized
that this may be due in part to improved disease control
afforded by trastuzumab therapy; before its availability,
patients may have died from systemic disease before developing brain metastases.
Vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted
therapy

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) overexpression is common in breast cancer and associated with
poor clinical outcomes.21 Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech), a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF,
was granted accelerated approval in the United States for
the first-line treatment of MBC in combination with
paclitaxel in 2008. Initial approval was based on the
results of a phase 3 study (E2100 [N ¼ 772]), in which
paclitaxel plus bevacizumab significantly prolonged PFS
versus paclitaxel alone (median, 11.8 vs 5.9 months; P <
.001) and increased the RR (36.9% vs 21.2%, P < .001),
with a significantly higher 1-year OS rate (81.2% vs
73.4%; P ¼ .01) but not significantly longer median OS
(26.7 vs 25.2 months; P ¼ .16).22 However, the original
regulatory approval has since been called into question in
the United States. Two phase 3 trials (AVADO23 and
RIBBON-124) conducted since E2100 have not reported
significant improvements in OS with bevacizumab; however, patients in both trials who progressed on chemotherapy alone were allowed to receive bevacizumab as part of
second-line therapy, which may have confounded these
results.23,24 In Europe, bevacizumab use in MBC is restricted to combination with paclitaxel or capecitabine (as
of April 2011), but the US Food and Drug Administration is considering the removal of its indication for MBC
entirely; until these proceedings are concluded, however,
bevacizumab remains approved for use in the United
States in combination with paclitaxel.25
Results of a pooled analysis of E2100,22 AVADO,23
and RIBBON-124 confirmed the significant PFS benefit
of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy
alone (median, 9.2 vs 6.7 months; P < .0001). Although
an OS benefit was not apparent based on median durations (26.7 vs 26.4 months; P ¼ .56), patients receiving
bevacizumab plus chemotherapy had a significantly
higher 1-year survival rate of 81.6% versus 76.5% for the
control arms (P ¼ .003).26
Investigational Targeted Treatments for MBC
Several new potential therapeutic targets have recently
been indentified among the multiple signaling pathways

3016

involved in the development, growth, and survival of
breast cancer cells (Fig. 1). The subsequent sections of this
review article discuss the currently available efficacy results
and ongoing trials of targeted therapies for MBC; the
safety results associated with these agents are included in
Table 1.
HER2-targeted therapy

HER2, also known as ErbB2, is among the most
studied molecules in cancer research, with the clinical success of trastuzumab in HER2-expressing breast cancer
demonstrating the benefit of targeting this receptor; however, its limitations with respect to cardiac toxicity, development of tumor resistance, and lack of action on brain
metastases27,28 has prompted the search for newer HER2targeted agents.
Pertuzumab (Genentech) is a humanized monoclonal antibody to the HER2 receptor. In a phase 2 trial of
pertuzumab plus trastuzumab in patients with HER2positive, trastuzumab-progressive MBC, there were 5 CRs
(7.6%) and 11 PRs (16.7%) among 66 evaluable patients
and 17 patients (25.8%) with stable disease (SD) for >6
months.29 In the phase 2 NeoSphere trial30 of neoadjuvant trastuzumab/docetaxel, pertuzumab/trastuzumab/
docetaxel, pertuzumab/trastuzumab, and docetaxel/pertuzumab, the RR was significantly higher with pertuzumab/
trastuzumab/docetaxel versus trastuzumab/docetaxel (P ¼
.014) and with trastuzumab/docetaxel versus pertuzumab/trastuzumab (P ¼ .031). A placebo-controlled phase
3 trial of trastuzumab/docetaxel with or without pertuzumab in previously untreated HER2-positive MBC is
ongoing (CLEOPATRA/NCT00567190).
Trastuzumab-DM1 (Genentech) is an immunoconjugate combining trastuzumab with the chemotherapeutic agent maytansine (DM1). In a phase 2 study of
112 patients with HER2-positive MBC who progressed
after previous treatment with a HER2-directed agent and
chemotherapy, trastuzumab-DM1 was associated with an
RR of 25.9% and a median PFS of 4.6 months; median
duration of response was not reached.31 Preliminary
results of a phase Ib/II study of trastuzumab-DM1 with
pertuzumab in a HER2-positive, trastuzumab-pretreated
advanced disease population included 9 PRs (7 unconfirmed) among the first 23 evaluable patients.32 Preliminary results of a phase 2 study of trastuzumab-DM1
versus trastuzumab/docetaxel in first-line HER2-positive
MBC indicated comparable RRs of 48% and 41%,
respectively33; however, a more recent update indicated
that PFS was significantly longer with trastuzumab-DM1

this rationale, agents targeting EGFR and other compensatory signaling pathways have been developed. Erlotinib
(Tarceva; Genentech) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that
selectively targets EGFR/HER1. In a phase 2 study of the
combination of erlotinib and weekly docetaxel in MBC
patients who had not received prior chemotherapy for recurrence or metastases, preliminary results included PR
and SD rates of 55% (11 of 20) and 35% (7 of 20),
respectively, with median OS of 23 months.37 Numerous
ongoing phase 2 trials are evaluating erlotinib in patients
with MBC, including as monotherapy (NCT00739063;
NCT00597597) or in combination with endocrine therapies (NCT00611715; NCT00570258) or maintenance
bevacizumab (NCT00733408) specifically for triple-negative disease.
EGFR/HER2 inhibitors

Afatinib (BIBW 2992; Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) is an irreversible inhibitor of EGFR/

tive patients (n ¼ 21) and clinical benefit for 4 cycles in
triple-negative patients (n ¼ 29). Preliminary results indicated no objective responses in either cohort, with median
PFS of 54 days for the HER2-negative, hormone receptorpositive patients and 52 days for the triple-negative
patients. Three triple-negative patients had SD for 4
cycles, with a median duration of 184 days (range, 132-335
days).38 In a preliminary analysis of a phase 2 study of afatinib in patients with HER2-positive MBC that progressed
after trastuzumab therapy, there were 4 PRs and 8 patients
with SD among 34 evaluable patients.39 Preliminary results
of a phase 2 study involving postmenopausal patients with
ER-positive, hormone-sensitive MBC (irrespective of
HER2 status) treated with afatinib plus letrozole after prior
letrozole failure showed 5 of 28 evaluable patients exhibited
SD for 16 weeks (range, 163-443 days).40 Two patients
were diagnosed with progressive disease on days 113 and
116, respectively.40 A phase 3 study is evaluating vinorelbine plus either afatinib or trastuzumab in patients with
HER2-positive MBC failing trastuzumab (LUX-Breast 1/
NCT01125566).
Neratinib (Pfizer, New London, Conn) is an irreversible inhibitor of EGFR/HER1 and HER2. In a phase 2

study, neratinib monotherapy showed clinical activity
among patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who
were pretreated with trastuzumab (n ¼ 66) or trastuzumab
naive (n ¼ 70); for these cohorts, 16-week PFS rates were
59% and 78%, median PFS was 22.3 weeks and 39.6
weeks, RRs were 24% and 56%, and clinical benefit rates
were 33% and 69%, respectively.41 The responses were
PRs, except for 1 CR in the trastuzumab-naive cohort. A
phase 3 study is currently evaluating paclitaxel plus either
neratinib or trastuzumab as first-line treatment of HER2positive advanced disease (NEFERTT/NCT00915018).
Selected additional VEGF-targeted therapies

Aflibercept or VEGF Trap (Regeneron, Tarrytown,
NY) is an antiangiogenic peptide-antibody fusion containing portions of human VEGF receptor 1 and 2.42 Single-agent activity was very modest in a phase 1 trial of
patients with advanced solid tumors42; however, a phase 2
trial (NCT00369655) evaluated aflibercept in patients
with taxane- and/or an anthracycline-pretreated MBC,
results of which are forthcoming. Vascular disrupting
agents (eg, ombrabulin; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France),
another class of antiangiogenic therapy, are expected to be
evaluated in MBC this year.
Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors

Several small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which target numerous other receptor tyrosine kinases
(TKs) in addition to VEGF receptors, are currently under
investigation as MBC therapy. In an exploratory study of
continuous sunitinib (Sutent; Pfizer) plus weekly paclitaxel
as first-line therapy for MBC, 2 CRs and 5 PRs were
observed among 18 patients with measurable disease (39%
RR), and 5 additional patients (28%) had SD for 6
months, with median PFS and OS of 33 and 66.6 weeks,
respectively. Three of the clinical responses were observed
among 9 patients with triple-negative disease.43 In a phase
2 study in 64 patients with anthracycline/taxane-pretreated
MBC who received sunitinib on a 4 weeks on/2 weeks off
schedule, 7 patients had a PR (11% RR), and 3 patients
had SD for 6 months (5%), for a 16% clinical benefit
rate. RRs were 15% (3 of 20) for triple-negative patients
and 25% (3 of 12) for trastuzumab-pretreated, HER2-positive patients. For all patients, median TTP and OS were 10
weeks and 38 weeks, respectively.44 However, 2 phase 3 trials of sunitinib in advanced breast cancer, 1 in combination
with docetaxel as first-line therapy and the other in combination with capecitabine in previously treated patients,

3020

were recently reported not to have met their primary
endpoints.45,46
In a phase 2 study of sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) monotherapy involving 54 patients pretreated with 1 chemotherapy regimen, PR lasting 256
days was observed in 1 patient (2%) and SD for 8 weeks
in 20 patients (37%), 12 of whom had SD for 16 weeks.47
Median TTP was 58 days, and OS was 259 days. In another
phase 2 study (NCCTG/Mayo Clinic N0336) involving 23
patients previously exposed to anthracyclines or taxanes,
there were no objective responses with sorafenib monotherapy among 20 evaluable patients during the first stage (2
patients had SD for >6 months), and therefore the study
did not proceed to accrual in the second stage.48 Several
phase 2 trials of sorafenib in MBC are ongoing, including
placebo-controlled trials with gemcitabine or capecitabine
for bevacizumab-progressive disease (NCT00493636), with
paclitaxel as first-line therapy for HER2-negative disease
(NCT00499525), and with endocrine therapy for postmenopausal patients (NCT00573755).
Combination therapy with axitinib (Pfizer) plus
docetaxel demonstrated a significantly higher RR relative
to docetaxel alone (40% vs 23%, P ¼ .038) in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial involving 168
patients with untreated MBC, with a longer median TTP
in the former arm that was borderline significant (8.2 vs 7
months; P ¼ .052).49
Vandetanib (Zactima; AstraZeneca, Wilmington,
Del) has shown limited activity as monotherapy in
patients with anthracycline/taxane-pretreated MBC, with
no objective responses and 1 case of SD for 24 weeks
among 44 evaluable patients in a phase 2 trial in this setting.50 Placebo-controlled phase 2 studies of vandetanib
in combination with fulvestrant (Faslodex; AstraZeneca)
are ongoing (ZAMBONEY/NCT00811369 [boneprominent disease]; ZACFAST/NCT00752986).
Interim analysis of 62 patients in a randomized
phase 2 trial evaluating pazopanib (Votrient; GlaxoSmithKline) plus lapatinib versus lapatinib alone as firstline treatment for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer
demonstrated RRs of 44% and 30% and 12-week progressive disease rates (primary endpoint) of 19% and 27%
with lapatinib/pazopanib and lapatinib alone, respectively.51 An open-label phase 3 trial is evaluating pazopanib alone or with lapatinib for HER2-positive
inflammatory breast cancer (NCT00558103).

mechanisms of cell growth, including temsirolimus (Torisel; Pfizer), everolimus (Afinitor; Novartis), and ridaforolimus (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ), are under
investigation in breast cancer. In a phase 2 study of 109 previously treated patients (2 prior chemotherapy regimens
for advanced disease), weekly temsirolimus 75 or 250 mg
induced RRs of 10.9% (6 of 55) and 7.4% (4 of 54; overall
RR, 9.2%), SD (24 weeks) rates of 3.6% (2 of 55) and
5.6% (3 of 54), and TTP of 9.9 and 14.3 weeks, respectively.52 Preliminary results of a randomized phase 2 study
suggested a PFS benefit for intermittent dosing of temsirolimus/letrozole versus letrozole monotherapy (median,
13.2 vs 11.6 months; 16-month PFS, 45% vs 27%) as firstline or second-line therapy of postmenopausal advanced
breast cancer.53 However, a phase 3 trial of letrozole alone
or with temsirolimus was terminated early because of lack
of benefit from the combination in the first 992 patients,
with median PFS of 9.2 months and RR of 24% per arm
(including 2% CR rate in each).54 Regarding everolimus,
in a randomized phase 2 trial of daily versus weekly dosing
after 1 chemotherapy regimen for advanced or recurrent
disease, there were 4 responses among 33 daily recipients
(12% RR), but none among the 16 weekly recipients.55 In
a phase 1 trial of everolimus plus weekly paclitaxel/trastuzumab in heavily pretreated patients with trastuzumab-resistant disease, the RR of 44%, disease control for 6 months
rate of 74%, and median PFS of 34 weeks suggest a potential benefit for everolimus with respect to reversing trastuzumab resistance.56 Everolimus is being evaluated in
combination with weekly paclitaxel/trastuzumab in a phase
2 trial in patients with taxane/trastuzumab-resistant,
HER2-overexpressing MBC; among the first 25 evaluable
patients, 5 (20%) achieved PRs, and 14 (56%) had SD.57
Neoadjuvant letrozole plus either placebo or everolimus
was evaluated in a phase 2 trial of patients with ER-positive
breast cancer; RRs were 68.1% and 59.1% with everolimus
versus letrozole alone, respectively.58 In the TAMRAD
study, which evaluated tamoxifen alone or with everolimus
in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative MBC, the rate of clinical benefit (defined as absence of
progression) was higher with everolimus (61.1% vs 42.1%)
at a median follow-up of 13 months.59 Results are awaited
from placebo-controlled phase 3 trials of everolimus
combined with weekly paclitaxel/trastuzumab for HER2positive disease (NCT00876395; BOLERO-1), exemestane for letrozole-refractory or anastrozole-refractory
disease (NCT00863655; BOLERO-2), and trastuzumab/
vinorelbine for taxane-pretreated, trastuzumab-refractory
disease (NCT01007942; BOLERO-3). Ridaforolimus is

currently under investigation in a phase 2 study in combination with trastuzumab for trastuzumab-refractory MBC
(NCT00736970).
Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) has been detected in approximately 80%
of breast cancers.60 Cixutumumab (ImClone Systems,
New York, NY), a human monoclonal antibody to IGF1R, is currently being tested as MBC therapy in phase 2
studies alone and in combination with antiestrogens in
antiestrogen-progressive disease (NCT00728949), temsirolimus
in
chemotherapy-pretreated
disease
(NCT00699491), or capecitabine/lapatinib for HER2positive disease progressing after trastuzumab plus an
anthracycline and/or taxane (NCT00684983). Another
IGF-1R–targeting monoclonal antibody, AMG 479, was
evaluated in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant
in a phase 2 trial with reportedly no improvement in PFS
with AMG 479.61 Other signaling mediators that function downstream of EGFR, IGF-1R, and other receptors,
including the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
(MEK) pathways, are also under investigation as potential
targets for the treatment of breast cancer.62
Overexpression of v-src sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Src), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, has been detected
in breast cancer tissue.63 Dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers
Squibb, New York, NY), a small-molecule inhibitor of several Src-TKs, demonstrated activity in hormone receptorpositive and HER2-positive progressive advanced breast
cancer, with 3 PRs and 6 cases of SD at 16 weeks among
59 evaluable patients in a phase 2 trial.64 In another phase 2
trial, dasatinib was evaluated in patients with anthracycline/
taxane-pretreated advanced or metastatic triple-negative disease, requiring a dose reduction (100 mg twice daily to 70
mg twice daily) to improve tolerability. Of 36 radiographically assessed patients, 2 had a confirmed PR, and 2 had SD
lasting >16 weeks.65 Randomized phase 2 trials are evaluating dasatinib for MBC with bone disease (NCT00410813)
and in combination with fulvestrant (NCT00754325;
NCT00903006), exemestane (NCT00767520), or letrozole (NCT00696072).
The proteasome, which plays a key role in the degradation of proteins involved in cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, is a target for anticancer therapy.
Phase 2 data suggest limited activity as monotherapy for
MBC with bortezomib (Velcade; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass), with no responses observed
among the first 12 patients in a phase 2 trial prompting its
early closure.66 However, phase 1-2 dose-escalation studies in patients with anthracycline-pretreated advanced

Review Article

disease suggest activity for the combinations of bortezomib plus docetaxel (overall RR, 29% [14 of 48])67 or
capecitabine (overall RR, 15% [5 of 33]).68 A phase 2 trial
will evaluate fulvestrant alone or with bortezomib in ERpositive postmenopausal MBC (NCT01142401).
Inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 are also being
evaluated in MBC. Tanespimycin (Bristol-Myers Squibb)
plus trastuzumab exhibited activity in patients with
HER2-positive trastuzumab-progressive MBC, with 5
confirmed PRs among the first 21 evaluable patients
(24% RR) in a phase 2 study.69 Retaspimycin (Infinity
Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass) is also being investigated in combination with trastuzumab in trastuzumabpretreated MBC (NCT00817362).
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) influence gene transcription and represent a promising target for anticancer
therapy. In a California Cancer Consortium phase 2 study
of monotherapy with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat
(Zolinza; Merck) as first-line therapy or after 2 lines of
chemotherapy (trastuzumab), SD was observed in 4 of
14 patients (29%); these 4 patients had a median PFS of
8.5 months versus 2.6 for all 14 patients.70 In another
phase 2 study, 6 of 29 patients (21%) receiving vorinostat/tamoxifen for ER-positive MBC achieved an objective response, and 3 (10%) had SD for 3 months despite
progressing on prior endocrine therapy and 3 lines of
chemotherapy.71 Median PFS was 8.5 months for
responding patients and 2.6 months overall, with median
OS of 24 months for all patients. Phase 1-2 trials in MBC
are evaluating vorinostat in combination with paclitaxel/
bevacizumab (NCT00368875) or weekly capecitabine
(NCT00719875), with a phase 2 trial in MBC and other
advanced cancers evaluating response and biomarkers for
vorinostat/lapatinib
in
HER2-positive
disease
(NCT01118975).
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, an enzyme that
promotes repair of DNA damage, has been associated
with triple-negative breast cancers.5 In a phase 2 study in
86 patients with triple-negative MBC and 2 prior chemotherapeutic regimens, addition of iniparib (SanofiAventis) to gemcitabine/carboplatin significantly
improved the clinical benefit rate (52% vs 12%; P ¼
.0012), PFS (median, 211 vs 87 days; P ¼ .0003), and OS
(median, >254 vs 169 days; P ¼ .0012) versus chemotherapy alone.72 However, a phase 3 trial of gemcitabine/
carboplatin alone or with iniparib in patients with triplenegative MBC (2 prior nongemcitabine/carboplatincontaining chemotherapy regimens) was recently reported
not to have met its co-primary endpoints of PFS and

3022

OS.73 In a 54-patient phase 2 trial in patients with
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation-associated, chemotherapyrefractory advanced breast cancer, olaparib (AstraZeneca)
400 mg once daily (cohort 1) and 100 mg twice daily
(cohort 2) produced RRs of 41% (11 of 27) and 22% (6
of 27), respectively.74 Olaparib is being further evaluated
for BRCA1/BRCA2-associated MBC in a phase 2 trial that
is also enrolling patients with other BRCA1/BRCA2-associated cancers (NCT01078662), with a phase 1 trial of
olaparib/carboplatin in BRCA1/BRCA2-associated breast
or ovarian cancer or sporadic triple-negative breast cancer
underway (NCT00647062).
Clinical Perspective
An improved molecular understanding of breast carcinoma biology has led to the development and approval of
single-targeted and multitargeted agents for the treatment
of breast cancer. Because of the emergence of targeted
therapy and anthracycline-taxane–based chemotherapy,
the standard of care for patients with breast cancer has
dramatically changed and improved over the past decade.
However, optimal treatment remains a significant personal and clinical challenge, and much work remains to be
completed. The clinical evaluation of combinations of targeted agents and newer multitargeted agents may further
contribute to optimization of patient selection for trials
and clinical practice. Hopefully these new strategies will
yield improved outcomes for patients with this disease,
and a more individualized approach to breast cancer therapy will become the new standard of care. Results of
ongoing clinical trials in MBC are awaited.
Conclusions
Overall, the selection, dosing, and administration of
breast cancer regimens is complex, with modifications of
drug schedules and initiation of supportive care often
required because of drug toxicities, interpatient variability
in clinical response, and comorbidities. Management of
breast cancer, therefore, warrants the input of an experienced multidisciplinary team.4,75 Treatment of MBC can
prolong survival and improve quality of life, but it is not
curative; therefore, treatments with minimal toxicity are
preferred.4 As there is still room for much improvement
in optimizing efficacy of MBC treatment, new therapy
options are urgently needed.
The clinical success of trastuzumab, coupled with
the improved understanding of signaling pathways
involved in oncogenesis, has lead to the research and development of a wide range of targeted agents for the

Cancer

treatment of MBC. Combinations of different drugs with
different molecular targets, or against the same target but
using complementary mechanisms of action, might maximize the efficacy of treatment regimens. Novel targeted
therapies could offer an attractive approach to the future
treatment of MBC, and further research may lead to the
possibility of individualized therapy based on genetic
expression profiles or clinical characteristics.
