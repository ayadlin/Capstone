ABSTRACT
DNA damage responses contribute to cisplatin resistance; however, therapeutic
strategies to overcome cisplatin resistance have not yet been established. Here, we
demonstrate that inhibition of ATR-Chk1 pathway with the potent inhibitor WYC0209
sensitizes bladder cancer cells to cisplatin. In the clinical microarray profile, high
ATR expression is associated with poor prognosis in bladder cancer patients who
receive chemotherapy. We show that pharmacological and genetic suppressing
of ATR sensitized cells to cisplatin. Treatment with WYC0209 or siATR increased
levels of cisplatin-DNA adducts, concomitant with decreased levels of p-glycoprotein
expression. Additionally, Combinations of cisplatin and WYC0209 show synergistic
activity against bladder cancer. Ultimately, WYC0209 enhanced the anti-tumor effects
of cisplatin and suppressed p-glycoprotein expression in bladder cancer xenografts.
These results indicate that inhibiting ATR-Chk1 activation with WYC0209 suppresses
p-glycoprotein expression and increases cisplatin activity in bladder cancer. Our
findings collectively suggest that ATR-Chk1 is a target for improving the efficacy of
cisplatin in bladder cancer.

INTRODUCTION

transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT),
distant recurrences occur in many patients after primary
treatment. The incidence of bladder recurrence within 5
years can be up to 20% to 75% worldwide [2]. From a
clinical point of view, muscle-invasive bladder cancers
have been associated with progressive disease with a poor
prognosis, and treatment options have become limited

Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a common malignant
type of bladder cancer in the developed world. Bladder
cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer in men,
accounting for 7% of all cancer cases and 4% of all
cancer deaths [1]. Despite the surgical treatment of

[3]. Presently, cisplatin-based therapy is considered the
standard-of-care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer [4].
Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy has improved
the clinical outcome of patients with muscle-invasive
bladder cancer, the major challenge of treatment remains
cisplatin resistance [5]. Patients treated with cisplatinbased chemotherapy still have a poor outcome, and the
therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin is limited, suggesting that
some mechanisms remain unclear [3, 5]. DNA damage
responses mediated through the ATR-Chk1 pathway are
important factors for a therapeutic response and, therefore,
are targets for new drug development [6-8]. However, the
role of Chk1/2 signaling in the regulation of the cisplatin
response in bladder cancer has largely been unexplored.
Although DNA repair is important to cisplatin resistance,
other mechanisms are involved. For example, substantial
attention has been given to ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters, such as p-glycoprotein (also known as
MDR1), which is commonly overexpressed in cancers
[9, 10]. High p-glycoprotein expression was shown
to correlate with a poor prognosis in bladder cancer
patients after cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy
[11]. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that
repressing p-glycoprotein via gene-silencing strategies is
able to enhance the effects of cisplatin in hepatocellular
carcinoma [12].
We and others have reported that the inhibition
of ATR-Chk1 pathways could sensitize cancer cells to
cisplatin treatment [13-15]. Although a partial response
to the Chk1 inhibitor LY 2603618 was observed in
a phase I clinical trial, the effect was moderate [16].
Recent approaches to the combination of these ATRChk1 inhibitors with chemotherapy have been evaluated
in preclinical and clinical studies [17, 18]. However, how
these combinations sensitize cancer cells to cisplatin
therapy and whether these drug combinations are effective
in clinical practice are unknown. Despite these potential
strategies, there remains no effective therapy currently
available for the treatment of bladder tumors expressing
p-glycoprotein. Recent studies have revealed the inhibitory
effects of flavonoid compounds on p-glycoprotein that are
likely due, in part, to the multiple targets affected by its
polyphenol structure [19]. Additionally, flavonoids can
act as the core structure for designing modulators against
p-glycoprotein activity [20]. This observation has led
to the options for developing new anti-cancer agents.
Therefore, we used a xenograft model to demonstrate
that the flavonoid derivative WYC0209, when used in
combination with cisplatin, might also have significant
therapeutic activity.
Because multiple mechanisms may be responsible
for the response to cisplatin treatment, the strategy that
additional drug combinations will lead to the improvement
of the therapeutic response is an important question in the
development of new agents to enhance cisplatin activity.
So far, the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with cisplatin remains a major challenge in developing
effective drug combination strategies. We postulated that
therapeutic targets for enhancing the effects of cisplatin
may offer new opportunities for intervention.
In this study, we sought to identify therapeutic agents
to enhance the sensitivity of cisplatin in bladder cancer.
Here, we reported that the activity of cisplatin can be
pharmacologically enhanced by WYC0209. Unexpectedly,
we have found that WYC0209 suppressed the levels of
p-glycoprotein and increased the levels of cisplatin-DNA
adducts, triggering significant DNA damage and cell
death. These results indicate that WYC0209 can suppress
p-glycoprotein expression and serve as a potential lead for
combating cisplatin resistance.

RESULTS
WYC02 and WYC0209 are anti-cancer agents
that induce cell death in human bladder cancer
cells
Previously, we found that the natural product
protoapigenone WYC02 is a potent anti-cancer agent
using cell-based screening [21]. WYC02 inhibited
cancer cell proliferation and increased cell death through
the induction of ROS-mediated DNA damage and
the activation of MAPK signaling pathways [22, 23].
Although these compounds showed growth inhibition
in various cancer cell lines [21], their activity in bladder
cancer has remained unknown. As shown in Figure 1A,
the inhibitory activity of WYC02 and WYC0209 on cell
viability in BFTC 905 and 5637 cells was examined. After
treatment, WYC0209 robustly inhibited the viability of
bladder cancer cells with an inhibition of cell viability
(IC50) value of 0.49±0.03 μM and 0.32±0.09 μM in
BFTC 905 and 5637 cells, respectively (Figure 1A).
Notably, the activity of WYC0209 was 2-fold higher
than that of WYC02 (IC50: 0.97±0.05 μM in BFTC 905
cells; 0.89±0.04 μM in 5637 cells). We next examined the
ratio of death and viability using the live/dead assay. Cell
viability was measured by the detection of the calceinAM hydrolysis product calcein, which is an indicator
of esterase activity, and cell death was measured by the
detection of the EthD dye, which is an indicator of the
damage of the plasma membrane. We found that WYC02
and WYC0209 potently affect cell viability and death as
shown by calcein-AM activity and EthD staining (Figure
1B). At 1 μM, however, WYC02 did not induce cell death
in BFTC 905 cells after a 48-h treatment, as revealed by
the induction of 13.67±0.85% EthD-positive cells, but
significantly increased cell death in 5637 cells (Figure 1B).
Consistent with the viability results, the number of EthDpositive cells from WYC0209-treated cells was 2-fold
higher in BFTC 905 and 5637 cells than in WYC021948

sensitivity than BFTC 905 cells to WYC0209 (Figure 1B).
The induction of cell death was further confirmed through
the analysis of the cell cycle distribution. WYC0209
triggered an increase in the fraction of cells in sub-G1
up to 56.3±0.04% and 86.43±0.26% in BFTC 905 and
5637 cells, respectively (Figure 1C). By contrast, WYC02
induced a slight increase in the sub-G1 fraction in 5637
cells.

Response (DDR) pathway activation that can alter the
sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents [9, 24]. The ATM/
ATR signaling cascades are important pathways of the
DNA damage response, and these signals lead to ATRmediated Chk1 activation and ATM-mediated Chk2
activation, followed by the regulation of cell cycle
progression and apoptosis [9]. Because cisplatin-based
chemotherapy is the standard of care for muscle-invasive
bladder cancer, it raises an interesting question of whether
ATR expression correlates with patient outcome. To
determine the clinical relevance of ATR’s role in bladder
cancer treatment, we assessed a gene expression dataset
of 165 bladder cancers [GSE13507]. As shown in Figure
2A, high ATR expression was not significantly correlated
with poor prognosis. However, it is interesting to note
that patients receiving chemotherapy with high ATR

expression in the tumors had a significant reduced survival
time (p = 0.039). Cox hazard regression analysis revealed
that high ATR expression was associated with higher risk
of death (HR: 2.117; 95% CI: 3.854-1.163; p = 0.014).
Taken together, these finding suggested that ATR might
be targeted to improve therapeutic outcome in patients
receiving cisplatin.

test whether these synthesized compounds, WYC02
and WYC0209, would enhance cisplatin-induced DNA
damage, we initially treated bladder cancer cells with
WYC02 or WYC0209 and measured the level of p-histone
H2A.X. We also assessed the cleaved caspase 3 and
cleaved PARP-1. Cisplatin had a modest effect on the
induction of histone H2A phosphorylation at 10 μM. As
predicted, the effects of these compounds on the cleaved
caspase 3 and cleaved PARP-1 paralleled its effects on
p-histone H2A.X induction in 5637 cells (Figure 3).
Notably, treatment with WYC02 or WYC0209 had the
moderate effect on the induction of cleaved caspase 3 and
cleaved PARP-1 in BFTC 905 cells (Figure 3), suggesting
that a distinct mechanism underlying these effects may
decrease the activity of these compounds.

ATR-Chk1 inhibition with WYC0209 improves
cisplatin-induced DNA damage
As we and others have published previously [7, 13,
17], inhibition of the ATR-Chk1 pathway with selective
inhibitors can sensitize cells to cisplatin. We then
determined whether WYC0209 inhibited the activation
of ATR-Chk1 selectively in bladder cancer cells; thus,
strategies capable of inhibiting the DNA damage responses
(DDRs) may be effective in muscle-invasive bladder
cancer. As shown in Figure 3, treatment with WYC0209
inhibited cisplatin-induced ATR-Chk1 activation in
bladder cancer cells. Notably, this activity was selective
for Chk1, since the phosphorylation of Chk2 was elevated
by treating with WYC0209. Note that WYC02 had little
effect on the inhibition of Chk1 phosphorylation. To

WYC0209, but not WYC02, increases cisplatinadduct DNA levels and inhibits p-glycoprotein
expression and function
Given our finding that ATR was associated with
a poor prognosis and that WYC0209 can enhance
cisplatin-induced DNA damage in bladder cancer cells
promote us to test whether inhibition of ATR-Chk1

pathway with WYC0209 can alter cell susceptibility to
cisplatin. Because both WYC02 and WYC0209 structure
shares a similar pharmacological core, which contains
4-hydroxy-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one moiety that exhibits
multiple biological and pharmacological effects [25,
26], the mechanism underlying the WYC compoundmediated effects in bladder cancer cells remains unclear.
We assessed the levels of cisplatin-DNA adducts, major
determinants of cisplatin on-target effects. As shown in
Figure 4A, cisplatin adduct levels were elevated in bladder
cancer cells when cisplatin and WYC0209 were combined.
The cisplatin-modified DNA-positive (cisplatin-DNA+)

cells were increased from 24.11±0.39% to 63.53±0.21%
in 5637 cells when cisplatin treatment was combined
with WYC0209. However, unexpectedly, WYC02 did not
increase the levels of cisplatin-DNA+ cells (Figure 4A).
We conclude that WYC0209 is more effective than its
parental compound WYC02 in enhancing the effects of
cisplatin in bladder cancer.
Our finding of increased cisplatin activity in
WYC0209-treated cells prompted us to investigate
how WYC0209 enhances cisplatin activity. Because
ABC transporters are thought to play a critical role in
reducing the levels cellular chemotherapeutic drugs

[9, 10], we assessed the levels of p-glycoprotein after
combined WYC0209/cisplatin treatment. Analysis of
protein expression in the membrane fractions using
immunoblotting revealed that p-glycoprotein was
suppressed by treatment with WYC0209 in 5637 cells
(Figure 4B). Having demonstrated that WYC0209
effectively inhibited the levels of p-glycoprotein, we
investigated the functional activity of p-glycoprotein
using the rhodamine 123 fluorescent dye, a p-glycoprotein
substrate. We assessed the efflux of rhodamine 123 as
shown by FACS analysis. We analyzed both rhodamine
123-positive cells and the mean fluorescence intensity
values after 24-h exposure to WYC02 or WYC0209.
Analysis of FACS histograms showed that the
accumulation of rhodamine 123 in cells was increased
after WYC0209 treatment at the doses of 1 μM and 2 μM
in 5637 cells (Figure 4C). However, consistent with the

expression level of p-glycoprotein results showing that
BFTC 905 cells were resistant to WYC0209, the efflux
of rhodamine 123 showed no significant difference in
the mean fluorescence intensity values after WYC02 or
WYC0209 treatment in BFTC 905 cells (Figure 4C). In
5637 cells, WYC0209-treated cells exhibited a significant
increase in the intracellular rhodamine 123 levels
compared with WYC02-treated cells and control cells.
Similarly, following WYC0209 treatment, approximately
13% and 25% of WYC02-treated cells showed high
rhodamine 123 levels at the doses of 1 μM and 2 μM
compared with WYC02 treatment or control (Figure 4C).
These results demonstrated that WYC0209 can attenuate
p-glycoprotein activity and expression.
Since inhibition of ATR appears to sensitize tumors
to cisplatin-induced cell death [15], the elevated cisplatinDNA adducts evident here might be either an indirect

off-target effect due to inhibition of p-glycoprotein or
an indirect on-target effect on the inhibition of ATRChk1 pathway. To distinguish between two possibilities,
we examined whether the increased cisplatin-DNA+
cells is a direct effect of ATR knockdown. Knockdown
of ATR using siRNA resulted in a significant increased
cisplatin-DNA+ cells up to 72.46±2.11% at 10 μM
cisplatin treatment compared with cells transfected with
siControl (30.57±0.01%; Figure 5A), demonstrating that
the ability to increase cisplatin-DNA adducts is a direct
effect from inhibition of ATR expression. While the
increased cisplatin-DNA adducts is likely to reflect the
downregulation of p-glycoprotein after treatment with
WYC0209, we speculated that the increased cisplatinDNA adducts is associated with the downregulation of
p-glycoprotein and the inhibition of ATR. Knockdown
of ATR using siATR affected p-glycoprotein levels in
cells (Figure 5B). Treatment with siATR in the presence
of cisplatin decreased the expression of p-glycoprotein
(Figure 5B). Next, to determine if p-glycoprotein has a
functional role in cisplatin treatment, we knock down
the expression of p-glycoprotein using siRNA to test
the response to cisplatin. As shown in Figure 5C,
p-glycoprotein knockdown slightly enhance the activity of
cisplatin. Additionally, the data showed that p-glycoprotein
knockdown did not enhance the activity of WYC0209 and
cisplatin combination (Figure 5C). Because expression
of p-glycoprotein was not completely inhibited, we still
cannot rule out the effect of ATR inhibition to DDRs in
response to cisplatin. Together, these findings indicated
that the efficacy of cisplatin could be improved, at

least in part, by inhibition of ATR-Chk1 pathway. We
hypothesize that combination of cisplatin plus WYC0209
could enhance cisplatin-induced cell death and that this
combination might result in synergism. Therefore, the
effects of WYC02 or WYC0209 combined with cisplatin
were evaluated by using values of combination index
(CI). As shown in Figure 6A, the interaction between
WYC0209 and cisplatin was synergistic, whereas
combination between WYC02 and cisplatin exhibited the
addictive interaction. At 50% inhibitory effects, CI values
for WYC0209/cisplatin were ranged from 0.83±0.18 to
0.48±0.12 (Figure 6A).

WYC0209 reduces p-glycoprotein and inhibits
tumor growth in vivo
Given the observation that inhibition of ATR
suppresses the expression of p-glycoprotein, we
hypothesize that ATR-Chk1 pathway was partly
responsible for cisplatin resistance and that ATR-Chk1
pathway may be therapeutic targets for enhancing
response to cisplatin. Thus, to address whether this
combination strategy was effective in vivo, the nude mice
bearing 5637 xenografts were treated with WYC0209
alone, cisplatin alone, and their combination. Mice
treated with cisplatin or WYC0209 alone showed the
moderate effect on the inhibition of tumor progression
(Figure 6B). A combination treatment with WYC0209
and cisplatin robustly delayed the tumor growth in
comparison to control group (Figure 6B). We then
further test whether treatment with WYC0209 affects

the expression of p-glycoprotein in vivo, we performed
immunohistochemical experiments and semiquantitative
histologic score (H-score) analysis. IHC analysis revealed
that downregulation of p-glycoprotein was observed in
xenografts treated with WYC0209 alone (median H-score
= 78.6±3.8) or in combination with cisplatin (median
H-score = 81.2±1.1) in comparison with vehicle control
(median H-score = 99.6±4.4) or cisplatin alone (median
H-score = 96±5.1; Figure 6C). Taken together, these data
provide a possibility that inhibition of ATR-Chk1 with
WYC0209 effectively enhance the activity of cisplatin,
and cause a significant downregulation of p-glycoprotein.

agents [17], indicating an approach for cisplatin-based
therapies. Notably, targeting DDR-related pathways has
been proven to have clinical benefits for patient outcomes
[28]. However, whether these findings can be extended
to advanced bladder cancer is not fully understood. A
combination with cisplatin and WYC0209 was sufficient
to induce significant H2A.X phosphorylation (Figure
3). Notably, WYC0209, but not WYC02, effectively
sensitized cells to cisplatin, as evidenced by elevated
DNA-cisplatin adducts (Figure 4A). The data provided in
the present study will undoubtedly provide insight into the
treatment of advanced bladder cancer.
Additionally, ATR knockdown with siRNA resulted
in an increase in cisplatin-DNA adducts (Figure 5A). These
findings indicate the possibility that suppressing ATRChk1 signaling with WYC0209 enhances cisplatin activity
through elevated DNA adducts and may synergize with
other genotoxic drugs. Our previous findings demonstrated
that MAP kinase, particularly p38, plays a critical role in
WYC02-mediated effects [22]. Consistent with this, it has
been reported that ATR is required for p38MAPK/MK2
activation and consequently is important for cell survival
following drug-induced DNA damage in p53-deficient
cells [29]. Therefore, the mechanism by which WYC0209
mediates enhancement of cisplatin activity is an important
question for the current drug combination.
Cisplatin-induced p-glycoprotein activity has been
well studied [10]. Overexpression of p-glycoprotein
has been implicated in resistance through drug efflux,
endowing cancer cells with the ability to survive even
a high dose of cisplatin and consequently limiting
the therapeutic outcome. These results highlight the
potential mechanism to identify new agents involved in
indirectly regulating the level of p-glycoprotein rather
than directly inhibiting the activity of p-glycoprotein.
Intriguingly, we showed that WYC0209 can suppress
the expression of p-glycoprotein in cell membrane
(Figure 4B). Drug transporters have been considered
an important mechanism conferring pre-target cisplatin
resistance through the efflux of cisplatin [9]. Notably, the
downregulation of p-glycoprotein by WYC0209 or siATR
was observed, and is accompanied by increased levels
of cisplatin-DNA adducts (Figure 4 and Figure 5). We
propose that the response to cisplatin could be enhanced
through a combination treatment with WYC0209 and
cisplatin. Therefore, we suggest two hypotheses for
the enhancement of cisplatin activity. First, ATR-Chk1
signaling is engaged in DNA repair, and inhibition of
ATR-Chk1 pathway may affect the repair of cisplatinDNA adducts. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated
that homologous recombination repair is inhibited by
WYCs, and the process may be important to the functions
that render cancer cells more susceptible to cisplatin [13].
Second, inhibition of ATR-Chk1 activation may impact
the levels of p-glycoprotein through a distinct mechanism
that causes an increase in cisplatin in cells. The data

DISCUSSION
Resistance to cisplatin represents a major
challenge for advanced bladder cancer. Earlier studies
of ATR demonstrated a critical role for the DNA
damage response following chemotherapy [24]. We
have previously described a flavonoid class of anticancer agents comprising WYC02 and WYC0209 that
effectively inhibited the ATR-Chk1 signaling cascade [13].
Consistently, the role of ATR in regulating DDR factors,
such as Chk1 and Wee1, associated with DNA repair
and apoptosis, is well established [6, 8]. We show here
that inhibition of ATR-Chk1 pathway provides marked
improvement in the response to cisplatin in bladder cancer.
Importantly, although ATR-Chk1 signaling
components have been developed as therapeutic targets
and the associated inhibitors are currently being entered
into clinical trials for evaluation [27], a role for ATR in the
progression of bladder cancer remains unknown as well as
the exact mechanism by which ATR-Chk1 pathway affects
the response to cisplatin. Interestingly, analysis of the
dataset (GSE13507) showed that ATR mRNA expression
correlated with overall survival in the patients treating
with chemotherapy (Figure 2), suggesting that high ATR
expression could serve as a marker for sensitivity to
cisplatin in patients with bladder cancer. We propose the
hypothesis that if cancer cells rely on ATR signaling for
DNA repair, they are susceptible to genotoxic agents at
least due in part to defects in DNA repair functions. Our
findings showed that cisplatin-induced histone H2A.X
phosphorylation on Ser 139 was elevated upon exposure
to WYC02 or WYC0209. Similar results have also been
observed with other inhibitors of ATR [7, 17]. These
findings provide a combination strategy for bladder cancer
with defects in DNA repair signaling.
Dysregulated DNA repair signaling appears to
contribute to chemoresistance [9, 24]. Based on our
previous findings, the mechanism by which WYC0209
mediates chemosensitization appears to involve the
ATR-related homologous recombination repair process
[13]. Mechanistic studies have found that the inhibition
of Chk1 activation, which functions downstream of
ATR, triggers synergistic effects with DNA-damaging

reported here show that cisplatin in combination with
WYC0209 has a synergistic anticancer effect (Figure 6A).
Additionally, a combination therapy with cisplatin and
WYC0209 has a significant improvement of anti-tumor
activity (Figure 6B).
Taken together, our studies reveal a critical role for
ATR-Chk1 signaling in mediating cisplatin resistance.
We have identified a potential small-molecule inhibitor
of ATR-Chk1 signaling as an attractive treatment for
advanced bladder cancer. In combination with cisplatin,
WYC0209 appears to selectively inhibit the ATR-Chk1
pathway, resulting in a significant enhancement of
cisplatin activity. Similarly, others have also noted that
ATR-Chk1 pathway inhibitors sensitize cancer cells
to cisplatin independent of ATR kinase activity [17].
Given that ATR knockdown suppresses p-glycoprotein
expression, cisplatin and WYC0209 combination may be
useful for treating bladder cancer. In this study, we propose
a strategy to improve cisplatin efficacy by combining the
drug with an ATR-Chk1 pathway inhibitor.

cells were added to an MTT working solution (3 mg/ml)
at 37°C. After 1 h, the MTT solution was removed, and
the insoluble formazan was dissolved by DMSO. The
absorbance at 550 nm was read using an ELISA reader.
The cell viability was calculated using the following
formula: (A sample-A blank)/(A control-A blank)×100%. The cells
treated with the vehicle DMSO served as the control
group.

Live/dead assay
Cellular viability and cytotoxicity were evaluated
using the Live/Dead assay kit (Invitrogen) as evident
by fluorescence intensity (calcein AM fluorescence in
live cells and ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD) in dead
cells). Briefly, the bladder cancer cells were washed
with PBS to remove the culture medium. The cells were
incubated with 2 µM calcein AM and 4 µM EthD-1 in
100 µL of working solution for approximately 40 min.
Following incubation, cells were washed with PBS. For
measurement, fluorescence was detected and imaged using
Tali image-based cytometry (Invitrogen).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Propidium iodide staining

Materials

Late-phase apoptosis was assessed by cell cycle
sub-G1 analysis. Briefly, the cells were treated with
WYC02 or WYC0209. The cells were washed with
PBS and then fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with
staining buffer (0.5% TritonX-100, 50 mg/ml PI, and 1 μg/
ml RNase) at 37°C for 30 min. Apoptosis was measured
by the proportion of the sub-G1 population using flow
cytometry and the ModFit program (BD Biosciences).

WYC02 (protoapigenone) and WYC0209 were
chemically synthesized as described previously (Figure
1A) [30]. All chemical compounds were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and Acros Organics.

Cell cultures and drug treatments
The human bladder cancer cell lines BFTC 905
and 5637 were purchased from Bioresource Collection
and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). For BFTC 905
cells, RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone) was supplemented
with 15% FBS and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate. 5637 cells
were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 15% FBS (GIBCO), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM
sodium pyruvate. Cells were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. The compounds WYC02 and WYC0209 were
dissolved in DMSO to prepare stock solutions that were
stored at -80°C. The compounds were diluted in medium,
and the final DMSO concentrations were less than 0.2%.

Gene expression analysis
The microarray dataset and clinical information
was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus
(GSE13507,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/
acc.cgi?acc=GSE13507) [32]. To normalize the intensity
values of each sample, the raw microarray dataset were
processed using R and Bioconductor. The expression
values for ATR were stratified as low or high ATR
expression using the median value. The difference
between low and high ATR expression was analyzed by
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis determined by log-rank
test. Cox regression analysis was performed to quantitate
a hazard ratio (HR) and p value for each factor.

Cell viability assay
BFTC 905 and 5637 bladder cancer cells were
seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well and
incubated in culture medium for stabilization. The culture
medium was then replaced with medium containing the
indicated treatment for 3 days. Cell viability was assessed
using the MTT assay as described previously [31]. Briefly,

Cisplatin-DNA adduct staining
The method used for assessing cisplatin adducts
was described previously [33]. Briefly, cells treated with
siRNA or WYCs were incubated with staining solution

containing anti-cisplatin-modified DNA antibody (clone
CP9/19; Abcam) and 100 mg/ml digitonin for 12 h. Cells
were then incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h.
The signals were analyzed using flow cytometry (BD
Biosciences) and FCS Express v3.0 (De Novo Software).

Signaling), pThr68-Chk2 (Cell Signaling), Chk1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), Chk2 (Abcam), p-glycoprotein
(GeneTex), and β-actin (GeneTex). The bands were
detected using a chemiluminescent substrate (Millipore).
The expression of p-glycoprotein was evaluated by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) of xenograft tumor tissue.
Antigen retrieval was performed in a pressure cooker
for 20 min. The primary antibody against p-glycoprotein
(Abcam) was applied at a dilution of 1:50 for 1 h. The
tissue was incubated with Antibody Amplifier Quanto
(Thermo) for 10 min and with HRP Polymer Quanto for
10 min. The slides were incubated with DAB Quanto
Chromogen/substrate (Chromogen:substrate = 1:30)
for 3 min. The slides were rinsed with water and were
counterstained with hematoxylin for 2 min. The slides
were dehydrated at 60°C for 10 min and were mounted for
analysis. P-glycoprotein expression was determined using
the semiquantitative H-score (0-300) obtained by scanning
the slides and analyzing them using ImageScope (Aperio;
Leica Biosystems).

P-glycoprotein activity assay
The assessment of p-glycoprotein activity was
detected by the efflux of rhodamine 123. Cells (105)
cells were treated with WYC02 or WYC0209 for
24 h. Additionally, cells were then treated with the
p-glycoprotein substrate rhodamine 123 (20 µM) for
30 min. After treatment, cells were refreshed in culture
medium for 2 h. Cells were then collected and washed
with PBS. The levels of rhodamine 123 were analyzed
by flow cytometry and FCS Express v3.0 (De Novo
Software).

siRNA knockdown

Xenograft studies

Cells
were
treated
with
siRNA
(for
ATR,
siATR
sequence:
5’AAAUCAAGCAACAUCACGGAGGUUUG-3’;
for
p-glycoprotein,
siPgp
sequence:
5’-AAUGCAAUCACAGUUCUAAUUGCUG-3’;
and for Scrambled control siRNA, siControl:
5’-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3’), purchased
from GeneDire X. For the transfection of siRNA,
cells (106) were seeded into 6-well plates and then
were transfected with siRNA in diluted Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX containing Opti-MEM Medium (Invitrogen).
siControl nontargeting siRNA was used as the negative
control.

Xenograft experiments were performed at the
China Medical University. All animal experiments
were performed according to the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of China Medical
University guidelines. The mice were fed sterilized food
and autoclaved water. Five-week-old BALB/c nu-nu mice
were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal and
Research Center (Taipei, Taiwan) and maintained under
pathogen-free conditions. Bladder cancer 5637 (5×106)
cells were resuspended in saline buffer and Matrigel (1:1)
and then implanted s.c. into the right flank. Tumor growth
was monitored daily. The tumor size was measured using
calipers and determined by the following formula: volume
(mm3) = length×width2/2. Once the tumor volume was
greater than 100 mm3, the mice were segregated into four
groups randomly (n = 5). The mice were intravenously
injected with a). Control group: solvent (5% DMSO, 35%
cremophor, and 60% saline); b). WYC0209 group: 2mg/
Kg WYC0209 qw (135); c). Cisplatin group: 2 mg/kg
cisplatin qwk; d). Combo group: 2 mg/kg cisplatin qwk
and 2 mg/kg WYC0209 qw (135). The animals were
sacrificed using carbon dioxide asphyxiation according to
institution guidelines.

Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical (IHC)
analyses
Immunoblotting was performed as described
previously [13, 31]. Total cell lysates were lysed in RIPA
buffer containing 100 µM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM
PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail. Additionally,
membrane fractionations were performed using the
Mem-PER plus membrane protein extraction kit (Pierce).
The membrane proteins were separated according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Protein concentrations were
determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce).
The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then
transferred to PVDF membranes. The levels of protein
expression were detected using primary antibodies against
p-Histone H2A.X (Cell Signaling), cleaved caspase-3
(Cell Signaling), cleaved PARP-1 (Cell Signaling), ATR
(Abcam), ATM (Abcam), pSer428-ATR (Cell Signaling),
pSer1981-ATM (GeneTex), pSer345-Chk1 (Cell
