Advanced prostate adenocarcinomas enriched in stem-cell features, as well as variant androgen receptor (AR)-negative
neuroendocrine (NE)/small-cell prostate cancers are difﬁcult to treat, and account for up to 30% of prostate cancer-related deaths
every year. While existing therapies for prostate cancer such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), destroy the bulk of the ARpositive cells within the tumor, eradicating this population eventually leads to castration-resistance, owing to the continued survival
of AR-/lo stem-like cells. In this study, we identiﬁed a critical nexus between p38MAPK signaling, and the transcription factor
Forkhead Box Protein C2 (FOXC2) known to promote cancer stem-cells and metastasis. We demonstrate that prostate cancer cells
that are insensitive to ADT, as well as high-grade/NE prostate tumors, are characterized by elevated FOXC2, and that targeting
FOXC2 using a well-tolerated p38 inhibitor restores epithelial attributes and ADT-sensitivity, and reduces the shedding of circulating
tumor cells in vivo with signiﬁcant shrinkage in the tumor mass. This study thus speciﬁes a tangible mechanism to target the AR-/lo
population of prostate cancer cells with stem-cell properties.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) progression to metastatic disease accounts for
410% of all cancer-related deaths in men. Androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT) remains the principal treatment for PCa. While this
results in initial tumor regression, the majority of these patients
become noncompliant to this line of treatment, owing to the
emergence of androgen-independent mechanisms promoting
tumor cell growth. Moreover, although most initially diagnosed
PCas are acinar adenocarcinomas that display elevated expression
of the androgen receptor (AR) and its target gene prostate-speciﬁc
antigen (PSA), a substantial proportion of patients present atypical
clinical features, and are characterized by the blatant absence
of AR and PSA, but instead display immunoreactivity to neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation markers such as chromogranin A,
synaptophysin, CD56 and neuron-speciﬁc enolase. While these
AR/PSA-negative NE PCas (NEPC) (or small-cell prostate carcinomas)
are rare at the time of initial diagnosis, they however, account for
10–30% of advanced recurrent castration-resistant PCas (CRPC,
high-grade Gleason) following ADT.1 These variant ‘AR-negative
PCa’ or NEPCs are extremely aggressive, androgen-independent,
metastatic and therapy resistant, with their 5-year overall survival
being dismal at 12.6%, which categorizes them as the most deadly
subset of all PCa.2 Currently, there are no targeted therapies
available for this class of patients; their AR-negativity presents a
major therapeutic challenge.
It has long been recognized that androgens and AR exhibit key
tumor suppressive effects in the prostate. Genetic ablation of AR

in prostate epithelial cells has actually been demonstrated to
promote the development of invasive prostate tumors,3 while
targeting AR with siRNA has been shown to promote metastasis
through enhanced macrophage recruitment via STAT3 activation.4
Moreover, AR expression is signiﬁcantly reduced in metastatic
hormone-resistant PCa,5 while AR signaling was found to be
severely attenuated in some advanced PCa.6 Collectively, this
argues that restoration of AR and AR signaling could indeed have
beneﬁcial effects for the select class of PCa patients (such as those
diagnosed with NEPC/small-cell prostate carcinomas, or even
advanced adenocarcinomas displaying NE differentiation following ADT) that feature loss of AR or its downstream molecular
targets.
Emerging evidence implicates the existence of a subpopulation
of androgen-insensitive stem-like cells in prostate tumors (PCaSCs)
that may potentially aid in tumor recurrence, metastatic progression and therapy-resistance.7–10 However, the origin of these cells
and the molecular factors governing their stem-cell behavior are
still poorly understood, although there have been suggestions
that PCaSCs may be NE in nature (and hence AR/PSA-/lo).11
In a recent report aimed at characterizing the cancer stem-cell
(CSC) pool from PCa explants, drug-resistant sphere cultures were
found to be particularly enriched for cytokeratin 18, suggesting
their epithelial origin.7 Further, elevated expression of Zeb1,
an epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) transcription factor
associated with stem-cell properties, in androgen-independent
PCa cells as well as in prostate tumors of castrated PTEN

of CSC markers Zeb119,20 and FOXC2 in PSA-/lo cells (Figure 1d).
These results suggest that even in the androgen-dependent
LNCaP cell line, the PSA-/low cells resembling stem-like cells,
display the EMT phenotype as well as NE-like features.

conditional knockout mice advocates that PCaSCs are possibly
products of EMT.12
EMT refers to a complex cellular reprogramming process that
facilitates the conversion of differentiated epithelial cells into
loosely organized, highly migratory and invasive mesenchymal
cells. Although there are multiple suggestions that deviant
activation of EMT pathways may facilitate the development of
PCa, and possibly, aid in its progression to the advanced therapyresistant state,12–14 the precise molecular mechanisms that dictate
the EMT/CSC-mediated shift to altered AR signaling as well as to
androgen-independence, and the source of stem-cells in PCa
progression, remain largely undeﬁned.
Employing a PSA promoter-driven lentiviral EGFP reporter
system, we previously demonstrated that in both primary
PCa tissues, and in established PCa cell lines, the PSA-/lo cells
represent a functionally unique subpopulation that is selectively
enriched for cells characteristic of castration-resistant PCaSC.15
This undifferentiated pool of cells expresses classical PCaSC
markers (ALDH, CD44, α2β1-integrin), and undergoes asymmetric
cell division to generate the PSA+/differentiated counterpart of
prostate epithelial cells. Further, these cells are endowed with
elevated clonogenic potential and tumor-propagating capacity,
thereby highlighting the potential clinical beneﬁt of effectively
targeting this subpopulation of PCa cells. In a distinct set of
studies, we previously identiﬁed the central EMT regulator
Forkhead Box Protein C2 (FOXC2) as an independent factor
necessary and sufﬁcient to bestow carcinoma cells with CSC
features, as well as with migratory and invasive capacities required
for tumor progression in vivo.16,17
In this manuscript, we demonstrate a direct link between PSA-/lo
PCa cells, the EMT/CSC archetype and regulated AR expression,
and establish a vital role for FOXC2 in the induction and
maintenance of ADT-resistant PCaSC attributes. Further, we
describe the use of a novel approach to target FOXC2 expression/function as an effective method of inhibiting the generation/
function of tumor-promoting PSA -/loAR-/lo stem-like cells, while
simultaneously restoring epithelial attributes in these cells, hence
resensitizing them to ADT.

Androgen-independent metastatic PCa cell lines possess
increased EMT/stem-cell features
While LNCaP cells are androgen-dependent and poorly invasive,
the androgen-independent DU145 and PC3 cells are far more
invasive and harbor signiﬁcantly higher metastatic potential.21 We
observed that LNCaP cells predominantly exhibited epithelial
features including expression of AR/PSA and E-cadherin
(Figures 1e and f). DU145 and PC3 cells, on the other hand,
exhibited signiﬁcantly increased expression of EMT-associated
mesenchymal markers, as well as NE differentiation markers,
with simultaneous loss of E-cadherin levels (Figures 1e and f).
Interestingly, expression of FOXC2 was restricted to the androgenindependent metastatic cell lines DU145 and PC3, and almost
undetectable in the weakly invasive non-metastatic LNCaP cells
(Figure 1f).
Since FOXC2 is known to empower tumor cells with stem-cell
attributes in breast carcinoma,17 we tested these PCa cell lines for
stem-cell properties including their ability to form prostospheres,
and expression of stem-cell-related cell-surface markers CD44
and CD24.22 In correlation with their reduced sphere-forming
capacity in non-adherent cultures, the poorly invasive LNCaP
cells harbored o 1% CD44hi/CD24lo stem-cell-enriched fraction
(Figures 1g and h). In contrast, more than 85% of the metastatic
DU145 cells were CD44hi/CD24lo (Figures 1g and h), consistent
with increased expression of other known stem-cell markers, Bmi1
and Sox2 (Figure 1e). We also observed that the two PCa cell lines
expressing high levels of endogenous FOXC2—DU145 and
PC3—formed signiﬁcantly higher number of tumorspheres
(Figure 1i), indicating higher stem-like potential compared with
LNCaP cells, which have very low FOXC2 expression. Interestingly,
the PCa cells that have higher metastatic potential and
augmented stem-cell properties consistently lack AR/PSA expression (Figures 1e and f).

RESULTS
PSA -/lo PCa stem-like cells exhibit augmented EMT properties
We have recently shown that the PSA-/lo subpopulation of cells
from primary human prostate tumors, as well as from various PCa
cell lines, represent self-renewing, tumor-propagating cells resembling PCaSC.15 We have also previously demonstrated that in
breast carcinoma, EMT constitutes a major source for the
generation of such tumor-propagating stem-like cells.17 To
investigate the relationship between EMT and PSA, we isolated
PSA+ and PSA-/lo sub-fractions, from the androgen-responsive
LNCaP cell line expressing the PSA promoter driving green
ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) expression, as described previously,15
and analyzed the expression of well-characterized EMT markers. In
comparison to the PSA+ (GFP+) fraction, the PSA-/lo (GFP-/lo) cells
clearly appeared more mesenchymal (Figure 1a). Quantitative
reverse transcription–PCR (qRT–PCR; Figure 1b) and western blot
(Figure 1c) analyses revealed that the stem-like PSA-/lo cells
exhibited markedly diminished expression of prostate epithelial
differentiation markers AR and PSA, as expected, with simultaneously elevated expression of known stem-cell markers, Bmi1
and Sox218 as well as NE differentiation markers 2 (Figure 1b).
In addition, PSA-/lo cells also exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced
expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased
expression of mesenchymal markers and the central EMT
regulator, FOXC2 (Figures 1b and c). Immunoﬂuorescent staining
further conﬁrmed the loss of expression and plasma membrane
localization of E-cadherin, with concomitant increase in expression

FOXC2 expression heralds the androgen-independent state
associated with loss of AR/PSA expression, poor Gleason scoring
and recurrent PCa
We previously discovered that FOXC2 is not expressed in
differentiated breast cancer cells but is markedly upregulated
following EMT, and is enriched in CSC fractions.23 We therefore
examined whether induction of EMT in PCa cells would similarly
result in upregulation of FOXC2. Indeed, we found that overexpression of Snail or Zeb1 results in induction of EMT and NE
trans-differentiation, and most importantly a signiﬁcant upregulation of FOXC2, with concomitant loss of AR/PSA expression in
androgen-dependent LNCaP cells (Figures 2a, c and d). Conversely,
inhibition of EMT-inducing genes such as Snail, or Zeb1 in
highly metastatic DU145 cells, results in a striking loss of
FOXC2 expression or NE-like features, with restoration of
AR/PSA expression (Figures 2b, e and f). Collectively, these ﬁndings
suggest that FOXC2 possibly functions downstream of various
EMT pathways in PCa cells.
To further investigate the physiological signiﬁcance of FOXC2 in
prostate tumor progression, we analyzed the GDS4109 GEO
database that contains non-recurrent and recurrent PCa samples.
Notably, FOXC2 expression was signiﬁcantly higher in the
recurrent samples (Figure 2g). Moreover, we found a direct
correlation between markedly increased FOXC2 levels and high
Gleason grading, in two independent publicly available data sets
(GSE17356 (Figure 2h) and TCGA (Figure 2i)). To conﬁrm the
relevance of these observations, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses for FOXC2 protein in patient-derived

of FOXC2 (Supplementary Figure S2). Similarly, in patient-derived
xenograft models of human prostate tumors exempliﬁed by
castration-resistance, NE features and loss of AR,24,25 we consistently observed increased FOXC2 expression (Supplementary
Figure S3). Together, these data suggest that expression of FOXC2
in PCa cells segregates with the androgen-independent state that
is associated with increased stemness.
Enforced expression of FOXC2 induces the EMT/CSC phenotype
and increased drug-resistance
Since FOXC2 is induced downstream of several different EMT
inducers, and is by itself capable of potentiating the effects of
multiple independent EMT signals,17,26 we queried how ectopic
expression of FOXC2 would impact the behavior of epithelial-like
LNCaP cells, which are androgen dependent. In fact, overexpression of FOXC2 resulted in the generation of cells that displayed
the classic mesenchymal phenotype (Figure 3a, upper panel) and
induced the expression of EMT markers (Figures 3b and c), along
with signiﬁcant upregulation of known stem-cell markers, Bmi1
and Sox2 (Figure 3b), as well as common clinical NE markers
(Figure 3b). This was also accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase in
tumorsphere formation (Figure 3d), suggesting enhanced stemcell function. Again, FOXC2-induced EMT was associated with a
reduction in PSA promoter activity (as determined by loss of GFP)
(Figure 3a, lower panel), as well as loss of AR expression
(Figures 3b and c). We also observed that FOXC2 expression
rendered androgen-dependent LNCaP cells increasingly resistant
to Enzalutamide (Figure 3e) (a common anti-androgen) and
Docetaxel (Figure 3f) (a common chemotherapeutic used in PCa),
using the MTS cell survival assay.
Inhibition of FOXC2 reduces stem-cell properties, and restores
AR/PSA expression as well as drug sensitivity
To conﬁrm the contribution of FOXC2-mediated EMT in the
generation and maintenance of stem-cell attributes in PCa cells,
we stably knocked down FOXC2 expression in androgenindependent DU145 cells, which we have shown (Figure 1) to
contain a signiﬁcantly high stem-cell-enriched fraction. Loss of
FOXC2 expression resulted in the acquisition of a uniform
epithelial phenotype in DU145 cells, which are otherwise known
to possess a heterogeneous morphology (Figure 3g), as well as
reversal of EMT and NE-like features (Figures 3h and i).
Interestingly, we observed a signiﬁcant upregulation in AR/PSA
levels when FOXC2 expression was lost (Figures 3h and j). This was
accompanied by a massive reduction in self-renewal potential and
stem-cell properties in DU145 cells (Figures 3k–m), including
expression of Bmi1 and Sox2 (Figure 3h). DU145 cells are
androgen-independent and insensitive to the AR inhibitor
Enzalutamide, even at 10 μM.27 However, suppression of FOXC2
in these cells rendered them more sensitive to Enzalutamide even
at 100 nM, as determined by the MTS cell survival assay (Figure 3n).
Emergence of Docetaxel-resistance in PCa remains an important
therapeutic hurdle, and DU145 cells represent a good model
system to study mechanisms altering Docetaxel-resistance.28
Interestingly, loss of FOXC2 expression rendered DU145 cells
more susceptible to 100 nM Docetaxel treatment (Figure 3o).
Together, these results suggest that FOXC2 expression is
necessary and sufﬁcient for the induction of PCaSC attributes
associated with loss of AR/PSA expression and emergence of
androgen-independence and chemo-resistance.
FOXC2 regulates AR via Zeb1, a known transcriptional repressor
It is notable that although FOXC2 functions as a transcriptional
activator in most cell types studied, its expression in PCa cells,
however, causes a drastic loss of AR/PSA levels. In this context, it is
pertinent to reveal parallel studies from our laboratory performed

in breast cancer cells, which demonstrate that FOXC2 exerts its
repressive effects indirectly through Zeb1, a known transcriptional
repressor (Werden et al., under review). We therefore investigated
if similar links are operative in PCa cells. In LNCaP cells
overexpressing FOXC2, we observed that enforced loss of Zeb1
drastically obliterates the AR-repressive effect of FOXC2
(Figure 4a), as well as their stem-cell properties (Figure 4b), and
resistance to Enzalutamide (Figure 4c). Further, overexpression of
Zeb1 in DU145 cells lacking FOXC2 expression was sufﬁcient to
cause a signiﬁcant downregulation in AR levels (Figure 4d), with
restoration of sphere-forming capacity (Figure 4e) and resistance
to Enzalutamide (Figure 4f). These data suggest that FOXC2dictated PCaSC attributes associated with loss of AR expression
and emergence of ADT-resistance are mediated by Zeb1.
Activation of p38MAPK signaling correlates with FOXC2-associated
EMT/stem-cell features
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are known to play
key roles in cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis,
invasion and migration—attributes that are all signiﬁcantly altered
during the course of cancer progression.29 In a parallel study using
breast cancer cells, we found that FOXC2 not only possesses
functional phosphorylation sites for p38MAPK14, but that
both FOXC2 and the active form of p38 (phospho-p38) are
consistently high in cells that have undergone EMT, as well as in
CSC-enriched cell populations (Werden et al., under review).
In fact, we observed that PCa cells with inherent mesenchymal
and stem-cell properties (DU145/PC3 relative to LNCaP or
PSAhi relative to PSA-/lo) exhibit signiﬁcantly increased p-p38
and its direct target, Activating Transcription Factor-2 (pATF2)
(Figures 5a and d), which strongly correlates with FOXC2
expression (Figures 1b, f and 5c, d).
We further tested this correlation between FOXC2 expression
and p38 activation in yet another model of prostate EMT
induction, using Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGFβ1). TGFβ1
is a well-characterized activator of p38 signaling, and has been
shown to induce EMT in a variety of epithelial cell types including
the prostate.29,30 Treatment of LNCaP cells with TGFβ1 resulted in
moderate induction of EMT, FOXC2 expression, as well as
concurrent activation of p38 signaling (Figure 5e), and increased
stem-cell function (Figure 5f). On the contrary, suppression of
TGFβ1 signaling in DU145 cells using LY364947, resulted in a
concomitant loss of FOXC2 expression and p38 signaling
(Figure 5e), with markedly reduced tumorsphere-forming capacity
(Figure 5f). Together, all the above data suggest that targeting
FOXC2, by interfering with p38 signaling, may provide a
therapeutic solution to preventing CSC generation/function in
androgen-insensitive PCa cells.
Interestingly, we discovered a potential p38 phosphorylation
site harbored within a consensus sequence on human FOXC2
protein (Figure 5g). We next investigated the functional relevance
of this putative site in facilitating FOXC2-mediated stem-cell
functions in PCa cells. While expression of the S367E-FOXC2
mutant, which mimics constitutive p38 phosphorylation,
enhanced sphere formation and Zeb1 expression associated with
loss of AR, the S367A-FOXC2 mutant, which represents the nonp38-phophorylatable form of FOXC2, resulted in a loss of stem-cell
function and Zeb1 expression, with concomitant restoration in AR
expression (Figures 5h and i). These results suggest that FOXC2
may be a direct target of p38 in PCa cells, and further that the
S367 site plays a key role in mediating FOXC2 functions in
these cells.
Suppression of p38 signaling results in reversal of EMT and
signiﬁcant decrease in stem-cell properties
Treatment of DU145 cells with SB203580, a speciﬁc chemical
inhibitor of p38 signaling, for 7 days resulted in their acquisition of

resensitized these cells to subsequent co-treatment with
SB203580 and either Enzalutamide (Figure 6j) or Docetaxel

effective in targeting highly invasive PCa cells that are resistant to
ADT and standard chemotherapy.

Interestingly, inhibition of p38 signaling and FOXC2 expression using SB203580 resulted in restoration of AR and PSA
expression in DU145 cells (Figures 6d, e and i). qRT–PCR
performed progressively from days 0–7 after SB203580 treatment revealed that expression of AR, PSA and E-cadherin
consistently increased right after 48 h, but reached highest

Combinatorial suppression of p38 signaling with Enzalutamide
treatment signiﬁcantly reduces tumor size
To investigate the effect of inhibition of FOXC2-dependent
EMT/CSC attributes on tumor formation in vivo, we s.c. injected
NOD/SCID mice with DU145 cells and began treatment in vivo,
after formation of palpable tumors. The treatment plan/schedule
is depicted in Figure 7a. While there was no appreciable change
in tumor size in mice treated singly with either SB203580 or
Oncogene (2016) 5963 – 5976

Enzalutamide compared with the vehicle-treated group, mice
treated with a combination of SB203580 and Enzalutamide
showed a signiﬁcant decrease in tumor volume and weight
(Figures 7b and e, Supplementary Figure S5). This suggested that
although parental DU145 cells are Enzalutamide-resistant to
begin with, co-treatment of cells with the p38 inhibitor and
Enzalutamide, once again confers susceptibility to ADT. In direct
corroboration of our in vitro results (Figure 6), such a combinatorial

FOXC2 determines EMT and stem-cell features in PCa

treatment in mice bearing aggressive DU145 tumors, reduced
FOXC2 expression and consequent EMT/CSC/NE features, and
facilitated restoration of AR/PSA expression in the tumors
(Figures 7f and g).
EMT has long been recognized to provide a ‘passport’ to tumor
cells allowing their invasion of tissue boundaries and entry into
circulation. These ‘altered’ circulating tumor cells (CTC) then go on
to sow the seeds for distant metastasis. In support of an important
role for FOXC2-mediated EMT/CSC properties facilitating prostate
tumor cell shedding into circulation, we indeed observed that
combinatorial treatment markedly reduced the number of CTCs in
mice, quantiﬁed as red ﬂuorescent protein (RFP)-positive CTC
colonies isolated from blood (Figure 7h).
DISCUSSION
Multiple recent efforts have collectively proposed that androgen
depletion (the mainstay treatment for PCa) results in the induction
of tumor-promoting EMT, suggesting that patients undergoing
ADT might beneﬁt from concurrent treatment with an inhibitor of
EMT signaling.13,31,32 However, effective administration of antiEMT therapies constitutes a substantial challenge. Among the
most attractive targets are EMT transcription factors (such as Snail,
Twist or Zeb1).12,33,34 Unfortunately, they are not readily
‘targetable’ therapeutically. Furthermore, contemporary treatment
regimens, besides facilitating EMT in PCa cells, also promote
adaptive tumor plasticity via NE trans-differentiation, a process
that is associated with resistance to therapy, visceral metastasis
and aggressive disease.35 We therefore sought to develop an
alternative method that relies on the proclivity of cancer cells to
drastically alter their cellular signaling pathways to fuel growth
and survival; most importantly a tangible method designed to
eliminate the source/generation of PCa stem-like cells, the tumor
cell subpopulation that critically determines tumor initiation,
recurrence, castration-resistance and metastatic progression.
Our current studies using patient-derived prostate tissue
samples as well as human PCa cell lines with differing properties
of androgen-dependence and drug-resistance, establish the
strong correlation between FOXC2 (a known EMT transcription
factor)17 expression and loss of AR function associated with
castration-resistant prostate tumor progression. We therefore
queried the possibility of using signaling inhibitors impacting
FOXC2 expression/function to thwart CSC features in metastatic
androgen-insensitive PCa cells. One such ‘targetable’ regulator of
FOXC2 we have identiﬁed is the p38MAPK, a family of key serine/
threonine kinases controlling cellular responses to cytokines and
stress. Interestingly, the p38 signaling cascade has been previously
implicated in facilitating multiple aspects of PCa progression.36–41
p38MAPK can be effectively inhibited by small molecule
therapeutics, which have already been shown to exhibit favorable
activity in phase II clinical trials, for other medical conditions such
as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease
and rheumatoid arthritis.42–44 In this report, we propose a novel
extension of its application to androgen-insensitive, drug-resistant
PCas harboring stem-like attributes.
Intriguingly, Khandrika et al.40 have reported that activation of
p38 signaling in PCa cells may represent an adaptive response to
hypoxic stress. Our studies done under normoxic conditions
suggest that PCa cells activate p38 signaling on induction of EMT
and consequent acquisition of stem-cell features, probably reﬂecting
the early stages of transition to androgen-independence, wherein
hypoxic stress is not yet pronounced. However, we predict that
intervention by blockade of such a key signaling pathway leading
to FOXC2-mediated stabilization of CSC attributes, is bound to be
beneﬁcial even at later stages of PCa progression, especially since
invasive CTCs with stem-cell features have been detected in men
with advanced metastatic CRPC.9

It is important to note that suppression of FOXC2 in invasive
AR-/lo DU145 PCa cells was sufﬁcient to restore AR expression and
function, as judged by upregulation of its downstream target, PSA
(Figures 3, 6 and 7). Restoration of AR/PSA expression and the
associated epithelial state with loss of stem-cell functions (either
using SB203580, or directly, through FOXC2 suppression) rendered
these androgen-independent cells once again sensitive to
Docetaxel and Enzalutamide, with substantial loss of tumorigenic
NE-like features (Figures 3, 6 and 7). These observations lend
further support to the view that androgens and AR demonstrate
crucial tumor suppressive effects in the prostate. It is in this
context that we propose the concomitant use of the p38 inhibitor,
which offers the dual beneﬁt of impeding FOXC2-mediated
EMT/CSC attributes, while simultaneously restoring AR-derived
protection.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that FOXC2 is an important
determinant of PCa stem-cell attributes, dictating the biochemical
shift to ADT- and chemo-resistance (Figure 7i). We propose a novel
and tangible method to target FOXC2 functions in vivo, at least in
part, through systemic inhibition of p38 signaling. Targeting
FOXC2 curtails prostate tumor cell plasticity, by preventing both
EMT, as well as NE trans-differentiation. Our future efforts will be
directed to examining the molecular basis of FOXC2 function. We
believe this represents a cornerstone to our understanding of the
fundamental mechanisms dictating stem-cell function and tumor
progression in a signiﬁcant subpopulation of patients harboring
variant forms of PCa (such as NEPC or small-cell prostate
carcinomas) that are deﬁned by lack of AR/PSA expression, as
well as in metastatic CRPCs that arise following ADT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Authenticated LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells were procured from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA and cultured in RPMI
with 10% fetal bovine serum with penicillin/streptomycin. Cells overexpressing EMT transcription factors and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were
also cultured in the same media. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM
with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. All cell lines used
for this study were recently conﬁrmed negative for mycoplasma
contamination. TGFβ1, LY364947 and SB203580 were used at a ﬁnal
concentration of 5 ng/ml, 1 μM and 5 μM, respectively.

Inhibitor experiments—cell culture
For assessing the effect of inhibition of p38MAPK signaling, cells were
treated for 7 days with 5 μM SB20358045 (EMD-Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA)
dissolved in water. For assessing the combined effect of p38MAPK
inhibition and the AR antagonist Enzalutamide27,46 (SelleckChem, Houston,
TX, USA) or the chemotherapeutic Docetaxel28 (LC Laboratories, Woburn,
MA, USA), cells were co-treated with SB203580 and either Enzalutamide/
Docetaxel for 7 days. It is important to note that the concentration of
SB203580 used to treat PCa cells in our experiments, results in selective
inhibition of p38MAPK signaling, as also suggested in the study by Davies
et al.45 We did not observe any appreciable changes in the phosphorylation of Akt1, another potential target (data not shown).

Vectors
The use of the pCS-PSAP-EGFP-DsRed vector has been described
previously.15 pQXIP-Zeb1 was provided by Dr Harikrishna Nakshatri
(Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA), and pBabePuro-Snail,
pBabePuro-FOXC2 and pMIG-FOXC2 by Dr Robert Weinberg (Whitehead
Institute, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA). S367E-FOXC2 and S367A-FOXC2
mutant constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and
subcloned into the retroviral vector MSCV-IRES–GFP. The pLKO1 lentiviral
vector with shFOXC2 is previously described.16 The pGIPZ lentiviral vectors
with shSnail and shZeb1 were procured from MD Anderson shRNA Core
Facility, Houston, TX, USA. Two independent shRNA sequences targeting
different regions of FOXC2 5′ untranslated region were used for FOXC2
knockdown, with similar results (data shown are representative from one
of them). Similarly, for shSnail and shZeb1 as well. shRNA targeting ﬁreﬂy

luciferase (shFF3) was used as a control. Sequence details are provided in
Table 1.

Isolation of CTCs
Immediately after sacriﬁcing the mice, ~ 100 μl blood was isolated via
venipuncture in EDTA-treated collection tubes and stored on ice. Within
30 min, the blood was spun down at 1200 r.p.m. for 5 min, and the pellet
resuspended in 1 ml ACK-lysing buffer (Life Tech) and further incubated for
3–5 min. Cells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in RPMI with 10%
fetal bovine serum and pen/strep, and cultured on 10-cm tissue culture
dishes. RFP-positive colonies (originating from the labeled DU145 cells
injected into mice) were counted after 3–4 days in culture and quantiﬁed.

Immunoblotting, immunoﬂuorescence, RT–PCR, wound healing
and tumorsphere assays
Immunoblotting, immunoﬂuorescence, RT–PCR, wound healing and
tumorsphere assays were performed as previously described.17,47 Antibody
and primer details are provided in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Cell viability
(MTS) was assessed using the CellTiter96 Aqueous One-Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA).

Immunohistochemistry
Human prostate tumor tissue samples representing benign prostatic
hyperplasia, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, advanced Gleason Grade 7
and NEPC were obtained from Drs Nupam and Kiran Mahajan. Pathological
evaluation was performed by two independent pathologists who agreed
on the IHC scoring and the positive pattern expression of the markers. The
IHC scoring per se was performed in a ‘blinded’ manner (wherein the
scorers did not have access to disease classiﬁcation/group allocation
information) using the H-score system, including intensity (from 0 to 3+)
Oncogene (2016) 5963 – 5976

and percentage of positive cells (from 0 to 100%), with a ﬁnal scoring
ranging from 0 to 300.

Flow cytometry
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting for PSAHi & PSA-/lo cells and CD44Hi &
CD24Lo cells was performed as described previously15,17 using BD Inﬂux
sorter (San Jose, CA, USA).

Animal experiments
Approximately 4-week-old male NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MI, USA). All animal
procedures were veriﬁed and approved by the Institutional Animal care
and Use Committee of UTMDACC. To study primary prostate tumor
formation, 2 × 106 RFP–luciferase-labeled DU145 cells were injected s.c. on
both the ﬂanks of 6-week-old male NOD/SCID mice. Once palpable tumors
were discernable, tumor-bearing mice were randomly segregated into four
groups, and drug treatment was initiated every 24 h for 5 days per week.
SB203580 (0.2 μmol in 100 μl per ~ 20 g mouse), Enzalutamide (10 mg/kg)
or a combination of both drugs (or vehicle) were administered s.c., and
tumor growth was assessed as described previously.17 Investigators were
blinded to the group allocation while assessing experimental outcomes. At
the end of the treatment period, tumors were excised, average diameter
calculated using calipers and tumor weight noted. Tumors were then
processed for RNA isolation and/or ﬁxed in formalin, parafﬁn-embedded,
sectioned and stained with hematoxylin/eosin and pATF2, AR and FOXC2
antibodies.

Statistical analyses
Unless otherwise stated, all samples were assayed in triplicate. All in vitro
experiments were repeated at least three independent times, and all
