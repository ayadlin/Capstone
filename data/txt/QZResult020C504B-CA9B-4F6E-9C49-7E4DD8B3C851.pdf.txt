Abstract
Tumor vascular endothelium is rather resistant to the
cytotoxic effects of radiation. The HIV protease inhibitors
(HPI) amprenavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir have previously
been shown to sensitize tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of
radiation. Additionally, this class of drug has been shown to
inhibit angiogenesis and tumor cell migration. Therefore, in
the current study, we wanted to determine whether HPIs could
enhance the effect of radiation on endothelial function. Our
study shows that HPIs, particularly nelfinavir, significantly
enhance radiation’s effect on human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVEC) and tumor vascular endothelium. We show that
pretreatment of HUVEC with nelfinavir results in enhanced
cytotoxicity, including increased apoptosis, when combined
with radiation. Moreover, using several functional assays, we
show that combination treatment effectively blocks endothelial cell migration and organization. These findings were
accompanied by attenuation of Akt phosphorylation, a known
pathway for radioresistance. Last, in vivo analysis of tumor
microvasculature destruction showed a more than additive
effect for nelfinavir and radiation. This study shows that HPIs
can enhance the effect of ionizing radiation on vascular
endothelium. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration–
approved drug, nelfinavir, may be an effective radiosensitizer
in the clinic. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4886–93]

Introduction
HIV protease inhibitors (HPI) mimic endogenous peptides and
inhibit the active site of HIV aspartyl protease, a viral enzyme
responsible for cleaving the gag-pol polyprotein (1). This class of
drug has been very effective in controlling the effects of HIV in
patients. Although these molecules were designed to specifically
inhibit viral enzymes, this class of drug affects many metabolic
processes. Long-term side effects of treatment include hyperbilirubinemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and bone disease (2).
Recently, HPIs have been shown to have antitumor effects.
Kaposi’s sarcoma is an AIDS-defining illness characterized by
proliferation of highly vascular tumor nodules (3, 4). Use of HPIs
has a well-documented ability to inhibit the growth of these lesions
in patients (5). Initially, it was believed that a restoration of
immune function was the contributing mechanism; however,
studies using non-HIV–infected models have shown that HPIs
directly affect tumor cell proliferation and related angiogenesis
(6, 7). Further research has shown that HPIs inhibit tumor cell
proliferation in non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma (5), multiple myeloma

(8), prostate carcinoma (9), breast carcinoma (10), head and neck
carcinoma (11), and other forms of cancer. Although the mechanism of action is unknown, this class of drug has been shown to
affect a number of molecular targets, including Akt (9, 10, 12),
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk; ref. 8), signal transducers
and activators of transcription 3 (8, 9), nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB;
ref. 13), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP; ref. 14), basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; ref. 15).
In addition to blocking tumor cell proliferation, HPIs enhance
the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation (12, 16). Gupta et al. (12)
showed that amprenavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir attenuated Akt
activation and sensitized cell lines with a constitutively active
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to the cytotoxic effects of
ionizing radiation. Phosphorylation of Akt after radiation is known
to induce survival signaling pathways, including the inhibition of
GSK-3h and activation of p53 and NF-nB (17). Targeting this
pathway has the potential to affect the cellular response to ionizing
radiation.
We and others have shown that radiation-induced signal
transduction through the PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to
endothelial cell viability (18, 19). Furthermore, the inhibition of
VEGF receptor signaling affects radiation-induced destruction of
tumor vasculature by blocking PI3K/Akt signaling (20–22). Most
recently, nelfinavir has been shown to down-regulate VEGF
expression in tumor cells via hypoxia-inducible factor 1a to
contribute to radiation sensitivity (23). Therefore, because HPIs
have been shown to have antiangiogenic properties (6, 11) and
attenuate Akt activation in tumor cells, we decided to investigate
them within irradiated vasculature. In the current study, we
examined the effect of HPIs on irradiated vascular endothelial cells
and the ability of these inhibitors to enhance the effects of ionizing
radiation on endothelial function.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were
obtained from Clonetics and maintained in EBM-2 medium supplemented
with EGM-2 MV Singlequots (Cambrex). Lewis lung carcinoma cells were
obtained from American Type Tissue Culture and maintained in high
glucose (4.5 g) DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin. All cell lines were incubated at 37jC in a 5% CO2
incubator. Only cell passages 3 to 5 were used.
Amprenavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir were obtained from the Vanderbilt
University Medical Center pharmacy and stored in the dark at 4jC.
Amprenavir and saquinavir gel capsules were punctured and diluted to
10 Amol/L in ethanol. Nelfinavir pills were crushed and diluted to 5 Amol/L
in ethanol. Drugs were administered to cells 30 to 60 min or 18 h before
irradiation. A Mark-1 irradiator 137Cs (JL Shepard and Associates) was used
to irradiate HUVEC cultures at a dose rate of 1.897 Gy/min.
Cell proliferation assay. Passage 3 to 5 HUVECs were grown to 70%
confluency, suspended, and subcultured into a 96-well plate at a
concentration of 5,000 cells per well. The following day, cells were treated

with the inhibitors at several dilutions. Twenty-four or 48 h later, 10 AL
WST-1 reagent (Rapid Cell Proliferation kit, Calbiochem) were added to
each well. The plates were incubated for 1 h and then absorbance was
analyzed with a microplate reader at a wavelength of 460 nm. The mean and
SE were calculated for each condition.
Cell lysis and immunoblot analysis. HUVECs were treated with or
without protease inhibitors and incubated for 18 h. Cells were then irradiated
and processed at the indicated times. During processing, cells were washed
twice with PBS followed by 150 AL M-PER lysis buffer. Protein concentration
was quantified by the Bio-Rad method. Twenty-five to 40 Ag of total protein
were loaded into each well of an 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE gel and separated.
Protein was transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore)
and blocked for 1 h using 5% milk in 1 TBST. These blots were then probed
with antibodies for actin, phospho-Akt (S473/T308), Akt, phospho-Erk
(T202/Y204), Erk, caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology) in a 5% milk TBST solution. Membranes were then washed thrice for
10 min in 1 TBST and then probed with horseradish peroxidase–labeled
mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were
washed thrice for 10 min in 1 TBST and developed using NEN enhanced
chemiluminescence. Films were scanned into Photoshop software and
processed for analysis. ImageJ v. 1.37 was used to calculate densitometry.
Experiments were done at least thrice to ensure reproducibility.
Clonogenic survival. Passage 3 to 4 HUVECs were grown to 70% to 80%
confluency. Cells were washed with PBS, suspended with trypsin, and
adjusted to specific densities for each condition. The cells were then plated
on fibronectin-lined plates (BD Biosciences) and allowed to attach for 4 h.
Inhibitors were added at a 1:1,000 dilution followed 60 min or 18 h later by
0, 2, 4, or 6 Gy. The medium was changed after irradiation. Ten to 14 days
later, plates were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with 1% methylene
blue. Colonies over 50 cells were counted with a dissection microscope.
Surviving fraction was calculated as (number of colonies / number of cells
plated) / (number of colonies for corresponding control / number of cells
plated). These results were then plotted in a semilogarithmic format using
Microsoft Excel software. Dose enhancement ratios were determined by
dividing the dose (Gy) for radiation alone by the dose for radiation plus
nelfinavir (normalized for plating efficiency of nelfinavir) for which a
surviving fraction of 0.2 is achieved.
Apoptosis assays. Cells were assayed for apoptosis with 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of nuclei. Seventy percent to 80% confluent
HUVECs were treated with or without nelfinavir, incubated for 60 min, and
then irradiated at 3 Gy. Cells were incubated for 24 h then stained with
DAPI. One hundred cells were counted by an observer who was blinded to
the experimental conditions for each of the cultures. The percentage of cells
undergoing apoptosis was quantified in three separate experiments. The
mean and SE were calculated for each treatment group.
Tubule formation in Matrigel. Passage 3 to 5 HUVECs were grown to
70% to 80% confluency. Seventy-five microliters of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were plated in each chamber of a 96-well plate and allowed to
polymerize at 37jC. HUVECs were washed with PBS, suspended with
trypsin, and adjusted to a density of 4  104 to 6  104 cells/mL. Two
hundred microliters of cell suspension (8  103–12  103 cells) were added
to each well. Thirty minutes later, inhibitors were added at a 1:200 dilution
followed 30 min later by treatment with 3 Gy. Once tubules were formed in
control plates (4–6 h), digital photographs were taken of each well. Using
Microsoft Paint software, the tubules were outlined by an observer unaware
of the treatment conditions. ImagePro software was then used to quantify
the total length of tubules for each treatment condition and the mean and
SE were calculated (n = 4).
Endothelial cell migration. Passage 3 to 5 HUVECs were grown to 70%
to 80% confluency. Cell were washed with PBS, suspended with trypsin, and
then adjusted to 2.5  104 to 5  104/mL in starvation medium. Eightmicron, six-well plate inserts (BD Biosciences) were inserted into a six-well
plate. Two milliliters of fresh complete HUVEC medium were added to the
bottom chamber and 2 mL of cell suspension were added to the top
chamber. Cells were allowed to attach for 30 min. Inhibitors were added at a
1:1,000 dilution to both chambers, and the plates were irradiated 60 min
later with 3 Gy. Twenty-four hours later, the top layer of cells (nonmigrated

www.aacrjournals.org

cells) was removed with a cotton swab. The insert chambers were washed
with PBS, fixed in methanol, and stained with DAPI. Five high-power fields
from each sample were counted by fluorescent microscopy.
Endothelial closure assay. Passage 3 to 5 HUVECs were grown to 70%
to 80% confluency. Four parallel wounds were created on each plate using a
200 AL pipette tip. Inhibitors were added at a 1:1,000 dilution and irradiated
60 min later by 3 Gy. Twelve or 24 h later, plates were fixed with 70% ethanol
and stained with 1% methylene blue. Photographs were taken and relative
cell density was calculated as follows: (number of cells / original wound
area) / (number of cells / nonwound area).
Tumor vascular window model. We studied the time- and dosedependent response of tumor blood vessels to radiation using the window
model as previously described (24). Briefly, three mice were studied in each
of the treatment groups. Nelfinavir (30 mg/kg) was administered by p.o.
gavage 60 min before irradiation. The vascular windows were treated with
2 Gy of superficial X-rays using 80 kVp (Pantak X-ray Generator, East Haven,
CT). The window frame was marked with coordinates, which were used to
photograph the same microscopic field each day. Tumor blood vessels were
quantified using the ImagePro software by determining the vascular length
density of blood vessels within the microscopic field. The mean and SE of
vascular length density for each treatment group were calculated. All
animals used were cared for according to the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committees guidelines.
Tumor immunohistochemistry. Lewis lung carcinoma cells were
injected s.c. into the hind limb of C57/BL6 mice. After tumors grew to
200 mm3 (f1 week), the mice were treated with five consecutive daily
treatments of 30 mg/kg p.o. nelfinavir followed 30 min later by 2 Gy
irradiation using an 80 kVp superficial X-ray generator. Twelve hours after
the last treatment, mice were sacrificed and tumors were harvested, fixed in
paraffin, and sectioned by the Vanderbilt University Immunohistochemistry
Core Facility. These sections were stained for anti-CD34 (1:100; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and anti–von Willebrand factor (1:900; Dakocytomation) as
we have done before (25, 26). Microvascular photos were analyzed using
ImagePro software to quantify staining.
Statistical analysis. The mean and SE were calculated using Microsoft
Excel software. Student’s t test was used to determine P values between
treatment groups. P values V0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Effect of HPIs on endothelial cell proliferation. To determine
which HPI shows the greatest effect on endothelial cells, we studied
proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro. HUVECs were subcultured
in 96-well plates, treated with 0 to 100 Amol/L of amprenavir,
nelfinavir, and saquinavir. Twenty-four hours later, cells were
stained with WST-1 reagent and absorbance was analyzed by a
fluorescent plate reader. Figure 1A shows the effect of various
concentrations of HPIs on endothelial cell proliferation. A 50%
reduction in absorbance was seen after treatment with 5 Amol/L
nelfinavir, 40 Amol/L saquinavir, and 100 Amol/L amprenavir.
Treatment with >10 Amol/L nelfinavir resulted in minimal cell
proliferation. The effect of HPIs on endothelial cell proliferation
was verified using manual cell counts 48 h after treatment (data
not shown). Therefore, nelfinavir was selected as the best inhibitor.
Nelfinavir sensitizes endothelial cells to the cytotoxic effects
of ionizing radiation. To determine whether nelfinavir can
sensitize endothelial cells to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing
radiation, HUVECs were plated onto fibronectin-lined culture
dishes at specific densities. Once cells attached, nelfinavir was
added for 1 or 18 h followed by irradiation with 0, 2, 4, or 6 Gy. Two
weeks later, cells were fixed and stained and the surviving fraction
was determined. Figure 1B shows the mean surviving fraction and
SE (n = 3) for each treatment condition. Use of nelfinavir for 1 and
18 h before radiation caused a downward shift in the dose-response
curve, indicating a radiosensitizing effect. Treatment with nelfinavir

for 18 h was more effective than 1 h; however, both treatments
resulted in a statistically significant difference at 2, 4, and 6 Gy
(P < 0.05). The dose enhancement ratios for 1 and 18 h nelfinavir
were 1.31 and 1.58, respectively. Treatment with amprenavir
resulted in no significant change, whereas treatment with
saquinavir resulted in no colony formation in nonirradiated and
irradiated groups (data not shown).
Effects of HPIs on radiation-induced signal transduction. To
determine the mechanism of interaction between nelfinavir and
radiation, Western blot analysis was done to study the effect of
protease inhibition on radiation-induced signal transduction.
Because nelfinavir seemed to have the most efficacy in the

proliferation assay, we selected nelfinavir for the subsequent assays.
HUVECs were treated with either vehicle control (ethanol) or
5 Amol/L nelfinavir for 18 h followed by sham irradiation or 4 Gy
then processed immediately (0 min), 5, 15, and 30 min later.
Figure 2A shows immunoblots using phospho-Akt, total Akt,
phospho-Erk, total Erk, and actin antibodies for radiation induced
phosphorylation of Akt and Erk in HUVEC after 18 h preincubation
with nelfinavir. Treatment with nelfinavir effectively attenuated
radiation-induced Akt activation after 18 h pretreatment, which
correlates with the clonogenic data shown in Fig. 1. Densitometric
analysis of three separate experiments (Fig. 2B) shows that nelfinavir
attenuated both basal and radiation-induced Akt activation. The
effect of nelfinavir on Erk signal transduction was less pronounced.
Of note, the phospho-p42Erk (bottom band) has greater density
than the p44Erk (top band). This seems to be tissue and species
dependent as other groups have shown a similar pattern (27–29).
HPIs enhance radiation-induced apoptosis. Vascular endothelium show little apoptosis in response to 4 to 6 Gy but inhibition
of Akt signaling enhances radiation-induced apoptosis (19, 30). To
determine whether nelfinavir enhances radiation-induced apoptosis, we studied caspase activation and pyknotic nuclei. HUVECs
were treated with HPIs for 1 h followed by 4 or 6 Gy. Six hours later,
cells were harvested and processed for Western blot analysis.

Nelfinavir Enhances the Effect of Irradiation

Figure 3A shows the resulting immunoblot using anti–caspase 3,
cleaved caspase-3, and actin antibodies. Treatment with radiation
resulted in caspase cleavage at 6 h and treatment with nelfinavir
before radiation enhanced this response. Using the same treatment
conditions, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI 18 h after irradiation
and pyknotic nuclei were quantified by microscopy (Fig. 3B).
Treatment with nelfinavir alone resulted in a significant increase
in the percentage of apoptotic nuclei compared with controls
(P = 0.05), whereas treatment with irradiation alone was not
statistically different from controls. When cells were treated with
nelfinavir followed by radiation, the level of apoptosis was
significantly increased by a factor of 4 for 4 Gy (P = 0.04) and
factor of 8 for 6 Gy (P = 0.01) compared with control.
HPIs and radiation attenuate tubule formation. To determine the effects of HPIs on physiologic function of endothelial
cells, tubule formation in Matrigel was studied. HUVECs were
plated onto Matrigel-lined wells, were treated with or without
5 Amol/L nelfinavir, followed by sham irradiation or 3 Gy, and then
monitored for tubule formation. Shown are representative photographs (Fig. 4A) and the mean and SE (n = 4) for each treatment
condition (Fig. 4B). The use of radiation alone did not have a
significant effect on tubule formation. However, use of nelfinavir
alone reduced the number of tubules by f20% (P = 0.05) and
combined treatment significantly reduced the number of tubules
formed by 50% (P < 0.001). The reduction seen with combined
treatment was greater than what would be predicted by an additive
effect of either agent alone.
Effect of HPIs on endothelial cell migration. To determine
the effect of HPIs on endothelial cell migration, we studied
migration using both Boyden chambers and endothelial cell
closure assays. HUVECs were plated onto an 8 Am pore membrane
then treated with nelfinavir and/or radiation. Twenty-four hours

later, cells that had migrated across the membrane were fixed and
stained. Figure 5A shows the mean and SE (n = 4) of the number of
migrated cells per high power field. Use of radiation alone or
nelfinavir alone significantly decreased endothelial migration by
25% (P = 0.03) and 15% (P = 0.04), respectively. Combined
treatment inhibited endothelial cell migration by 60% compared
with control (P < 0.001), suggesting a more than additive effect.
Endothelial cell closure assay was studied in HUVECs grown to
80% confluency on 6-cm plates. A wound area free of cells was
created using a 200 AL pipette tip. Plates were then treated with
nelfinavir followed 1 h later by 3 Gy. Cells were fixed and stained 12
and 24 h later. Figure 5B shows representative photographs for
each treatment condition. The mean relative cell density in the
wound area and SE (n = 4) for each treatment condition are shown
in Fig. 5C. By 24 h, control plates had 100% closure. Use of radiation
alone resulted in a reduced number of cells 24 h after treatment;
however, when normalized for this reduction, the amount of
closure was comparable with control. Treatment with nelfinavir
alone attenuated wound closure at 12 and 24 h by f50% compared
with control plates at the corresponding time points (P < 0.001).
Combined treatment with nelfinavir and 3 Gy synergistically
attenuated endothelial closure by over 80% at 12 h (P < 0.001)
and 75% at 24 h (P < 0.001) compared with controls.
Effect of nelfinavir on blood vessel destruction in the
vascular window model. To determine the effect of nelfinavir on
blood vessel destruction in vivo, we studied both tumor vascular

window model and density of tumor microvasculature on histologic
sections of tumor. The vascular window is a transparent chamber
inserted onto the dorsal skin fold of mice allowing for visualization
of blood vessel formation and destruction. Mice were fitted with the
window chamber and injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells.
Once vessels formed, mice received one treatment of 30 mg/kg
nelfinavir via gastric gavage followed 1 h later by 2 Gy. Treatment
with nelfinavir alone attenuated blood vessel growth but had a
minimal effect of vessel destruction. Compared with either control,
combined treatment with radiation and nelfinavir resulted in a
lower density of blood vessels at each time point and nearly
obliterated visible blood vessels 72 h after treatment. Representative
photographs are shown in Fig. 6A. Figure 6B shows the average
vascular length density and SE (n = 3) for each treatment condition.
The effect of nelfinavir on blood vessel density was studied in
tumor xenografts. Lewis lung carcinoma cells were grown in the
hind limb of C57BL6 mice. Once tumors were formed, the mice

were treated with five consecutive treatments of nelfinavir and/or
2 Gy fractions of ionizing radiation. The tumors were then harvested and stained with anti-CD34 antibodies. Figure 6 shows
representative photographs (C) and the mean and SE (D) for each
treatment condition. Use of irradiation or nelfinavir alone significantly reduced the amount vasculature by 50% (P = 0.025) and 20%
(P = 0.03) compared with control, respectively. Treatment with
both nelfinavir and radiation reduced the level of CD34 staining by
over 90% (P = 0.002). These data suggests that nelfinavir attenuates
blood vessel formation and this effect is enhanced by radiation.

Discussion
Patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy often have
serum concentrations of protease inhibitors in the 1 to 10 Amol/L
range. In the current study, we analyzed the effect of HPI
concentration on endothelial cell proliferation. Nelfinavir was the

most effective at inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation at these
physiologic concentrations, whereas amprenavir and saquinavir
required concentrations four to five times higher to have similar
effects. These data indicate that nelfinavir effectively attenuates
endothelial cell growth and is more effective at concentrations
routinely reached in patients than the other protease inhibitors.
There are f10 HPIs that have been Food and Drug Administration
approved and dozens more that have been developed. The HPIs
chosen in this study have been previously shown to affect the PI3K/
Akt pathway in tumor cells. It is possible that other HPIs are as
effective as nelfinavir.
Irradiation of endothelium induces signal transduction through
the PI3K/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk pathways.
Compounds that block these pathways have been shown to be
effective radiosensitizers. Previous studies have indicated that HPIs
can attenuate Akt (31) and Erk activation (8). Furthermore, a recent
report suggests that HPIs have the ability to sensitize tumor cells
with constitutively active PI3K signaling to the cytotoxic effects of

www.aacrjournals.org

ionizing radiation (12). We and others have previously shown that
the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in HUVECs after ionizing
radiation (18, 22, 30, 32, 33) and compounds that inhibit this
pathway sensitize endothelial cells to radiation. In the current
study, nelfinavir was found to attenuate the phosphorylation of Akt
as well as Erk to a lesser extent after 3 Gy, a clinically relevant dose.
The other HPIs were less effective at inhibiting these pathways.
Because the PI3K/Akt pathway is stimulated by radiation and
this pathway is active in endothelial cells, we expected to find that
nelfinavir sensitizes endothelial cells to radiation. In the clonogenic
assays, treatment with nelfinavir for either 1 or 18 h before
radiation achieved radiosensitization. Interestingly, treatment with
nelfinavir for 18 h produced a greater radiosensitizing effect. The
enhancement with increased treatment time suggests that the
mechanism could be multifactorial, possibly involving genetic and/
or epigenetic changes. Previous studies have attributed the
radiosensitizing effects of HPIs to down-regulation of hypoxiainducible factor 1a and VEGF (23) and an inhibition of proteasome

function affecting NF-nB activation (16). However, one possible
mechanism is that of inhibition of Akt. Several groups have shown
nelfinavir-induced Akt inhibition in a variety of cell types, including
INS-1h cells (34), prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC3 (9),
3T3-L1 adipocytes (31), L6 myotubes (35), as well as SQ20B and
A549 head and neck and lung cancer cell lines, respectively (12, 23).
For all of these studies, the effects were seen after 18 h of nelfinavir
incubation, which is consistent with our data.
The process of angiogenesis involves invasion, migration, and
proliferation (15). HPIs have been shown to attenuate angiogenesis in numerous tumor models. Previous reports have shown
that attenuating the PI3K/Akt pathway enhances the antiangiogenic effect of ionizing radiation (15, 22, 30, 36, 37). In the current
study, we examined the effect of HPIs and radiation on
endothelial cell function. Three in vitro functional assays were
done using low-dose radiation. A dose of 3 Gy alone had minimal
effect on endothelial cell function; however, use of HPIs before
treatment attenuated tubule formation, cell migration, and wound
closure independent of cell death. The effect seen in these studies
was greater than what would be predicted by an additive effect of
either agent alone. Although nelfinavir was most effective in
blocking endothelial cell function, the other protease inhibitors
showed similar antiangiogenic and migratory effects (data not
shown). Because amprenavir and saquinavir had minimal effects
on attenuating radiation-induced Akt phosphorylation (data not
shown), the mechanism behind this response is likely multifactorial. Indeed, several reports have shown that HPIs inhibit MMP
degradation, alter levels of bFGF and VEGF, and affect activation
of NF-nB (23, 38).
To determine efficacy in vivo, two models of vascular formation
were studied. The vascular window model is an effective means
to quantify the effects of a compound on angiogenesis and blood
vessel destruction in vivo. In the current study, a single p.o. dose
of nelfinavir followed by 2 Gy obliterated tumor blood vessels
within 72 h. Treatment with 2 Gy alone or nelfinavir alone had
minimal effect on blood vessel destruction during the same time
course. The in vitro studies indicated that nelfinavir in
combination with irradiation directly affects endothelial function.
Previous reports have further shown the protease inhibitors can
attenuate bFGF- and VEGF-induced angiogenesis (15). Both the
direct effects on endothelial cells and indirect effects through
tumor cells and surrounding connective tissue are likely affecting
angiogenesis.

The toxicity profile of this class of drug and the long-term effects
on metabolism suggest that HPIs affect many cellular processes of
normal tissue. Indeed, HPI-induced insulin resistance, lipodystrophy, and accelerated atherosclerosis have been shown in
patients in what is sometimes described as highly active
antiretroviral therapy–associated metabolic syndrome. Multiple
potential mechanisms have been suggested, including increased
free fatty acid production, decreased perilipin, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species, and inhibition of GLUT4, PKC, and
Akt (39). As such, there is the possibility of normal tissue toxicity
from concomitant nelfinavir and radiation treatment. However,
nelfinavir seems to have less normal vascular toxicity compared
with other HPIs based on studies in porcine coronary arteries (40).
In addition, some of the studies that have shown significant
apoptosis and reactive oxygen species production after nelfinavir
treatment used doses up to four times higher than what was used
in our study (39). In our study, although nelfinavir alone had some
biological effects on the endothelial cells, dramatic effects were
only seen when used in combination with radiation. The clinical
data for radiation treatment in combination with highly active
antiretroviral therapy is limited but promising. Retrospective
reviews have not only shown better survival outcomes but also
less treatment-related toxicity with the addition of highly active
antiretroviral therapy to chemoradiation for HIV-positive patients
with anal carcinoma (41, 42).
HPIs have over 10 years of safety data. The side effects of these
compounds are tolerable and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been well characterized. For these reasons, this
class of drug has potential as an antineoplastic agent. In the current
study, concentrations of amprenavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir
routinely achieved in HIV patients were used in a HUVEC model
and in the in vivo vascular window model. The compounds
effectively enhanced the antiangiogenic effect of ionizing radiation
and are promising agents for future clinical trials.
