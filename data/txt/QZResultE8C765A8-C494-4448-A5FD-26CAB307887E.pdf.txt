Abstract:

A key aberrant biological difference between tumor cells and normal differentiated
cells is altered metabolism, whereby cancer cells acquire a number of stable
genetic and epigenetic alterations to retain proliferation, survive under unfavorable
microenvironments and invade into surrounding tissues. A classic biochemical
adaptation is the metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis rather than mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation, regardless of oxygen availability, a phenomenon
termed the “Warburg Effect”. Aerobic glycolysis, characterized by high glucose
uptake, low oxygen consumption and elevated production of lactate, is associated
with a survival advantage as well as the generation of substrates such as fatty
acids, amino acids and nucleotides necessary in rapidly proliferating cells.
This review discusses the role of key metabolic enzymes and their association
with aerobic glycolysis in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), an aggressive,
highly glycolytic and deadly brain tumor. Targeting key metabolic enzymes
involved in modulating the “Warburg Effect” may provide a novel therapeutic
approach either singularly or in combination with existing therapies in GBMs.

and functional mitochondria, tumor cells divert more of
the generated pyruvate to extra-mitochondrial breakdown
to lactate, the product of anaerobic glycolysis. There are
several advantages for this switch to aerobic glycolysis by
tumor cells, as discussed below. In addition, the increased
aerobic glycolysis in cancer is exploited for diagnostic
purposes. For example, Positron Emission Tomography
(PET) takes advantage of the increased glucose uptake by
using 2-Deoxyglucose labeled with 18F radioemitter, to
distinguish regions of tumor from non-tumor or necrotic
regions. Non-invasive MR techniques such as H-MR
spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain also takes advantage of
this increased aerobic glycolysis by gliomas, measuring
increases in choline and lactate levels with reduction
of N-acetyl aspartate, the latter associated with normal
neurons. In fact, the MRS profile correlates to grade of
gliomas, with the most poorly and unfortunately the most
common Grade IV glioma (also known as Glioblastoma
Multiforme, GBM) having the highest levels of choline
and lactate [2, 3].

INTRODUCTION
Metabolic remodeling is a predominant phenotype in
cancer cells and refers to the alterations in the utilization
and/or synthesis of important metabolites including
glucose, glycogen, fatty acids, amino acids, and glutamine
by tumor cells. In the early 1920s, Otto Warburg was the
first to describe a metabolic adaptation that occurs within
solid tumors, for which he ultimately received a Nobel
Prize [1]. Warburg noticed that normal tissues generally
use glycolysis to generate about 10% of the total cellular
ATP with the mitochondria generating the remaining
90%, the latter involving a process termed oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS). However, in many tumor
tissues, more than 50% of cellular ATP can be generated
from glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen, thus
termed aerobic glycolysis. By using aerobic glycolysis
(or “Warburg Effect”) even in the presence of oxygen

(pO2 = 10%) [4]. GBMs upregulate glycolysis more
than three times that of normal brain tissue, measured by
increased lactate:pyruvate ratio [5]. Using stereotactic
microdialysis of tumor and normal brain in GBM patients
the ratio of lactate:pyruvate was higher in tumor tissue
compared to adjacent brain [6].
Several in vitro studies have demonstrated large
variability in mitochondrial respiration and glucose
dependency in cell lines derived from GBM tissues and
xenografts [7-9]. The ability to modulate mitochondrial
respiration is an important component of tumor cell
survival under hypoxic conditions [10-12]. Although

GBMs are the most common primary human
malignant brain tumor, highly therapeutically resistant
and have a median survival of 12-16 months despite
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. GBMs are
characterized by pathological heterogeneity with regions
of pseudopalisading perinecrotic cells under moderate
levels of hypoxia (pO2 = 2.5-5%) and infiltrating tumor
cells into normal brain under normal oxygen conditions

result in the accumulation of substrates and diversion of
carbon towards R5P. The non-oxidative arm of PPP seems
to be more important for tumor cells based on higher
expression and activity of transketolase (TKTL1) found
to correlate with rate of tumor growth in some cancers
including GBMs [21, 22]. A further level of regulation
for R5P synthesis is the ratio of NADP+:NADPH in cells
through the oxidative arm at the initial step of PPP. The
reversible reduction of glucose-6-phosphase (G6P) by
G6P dehydrogenase is associated with reduction of NADP
to NADPH, an important reducing agent for several
reactions including fatty acid synthesis.
Tumor cells also employ glucose to assist in the
generation of fatty acids (Figure 1). Tumor cells require
fatty acids to alter membrane-targeted proteins in cell
signaling and for de novo membrane synthesis. Towards
the importance of lipid synthesis, perturbations in
enzymes involved in lipid synthesis inhibit tumorigenesis.
For example, depletion of ATP citrate lyase (ACL), the
enzyme that converts citrate into the lipid precursor
cytosolic acetyl-coA, results in decreased GBM growth
[23]. Acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid
synthase (FAS) are upregulated in many cancers and also
play a role in tumorigenesis [24, 25]. FAS synthesizes long
chain fatty acids (e.g. palmitate) from malonyl-coA and
NAPDH. Regulation by signaling pathways, such as the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway also modulate lipid synthesis.
Activation of this pathway increases nuclear localization
of the transcription factor sterol response element binding
protein-1 (SREBP-1), which then induces expression of
lipogenic genes like ACL, ACC and FAS [26].
In addition to enhanced glucose uptake and growth
factor signaling, fatty acid synthesis also requires two
supporting pathways: the generation of NADPH and
anaplerosis. A large amount of NAPDH is required for
the synthesis of fatty acids (e.g. the 16-carbon fatty acid
palmitate requires 14 molecules of NAPDH). Anaplerotic
reactions are those that form intermediates of the TCA
cycle, which require replenishing when extracted for
biosynthesis. For example, the export of mitochondrial
citrate for fatty acid synthesis requires the replacement
of oxaloacetate (OAA) by anaplerosis to replenish the
exported citrate. Glutaminolysis is an important metabolic
pathway in tumor cells, which can augment generation
of NAPDH and also replenish TCA intermediates
(anaplerosis), as demonstrated in Figure 1. The rate of
consumption of glutamine by tumor cells is much higher
than required for protein synthesis [27]. The first step
of glutaminolysis is the deamidation of glutamine to
glutamate via the enzyme glutaminase (GLS), and then
the conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)
via glutamate dehydrogenase. Glutamine-derived α-KG
is a TCA intermediate and the major source of OAA,
which replenishes the exported citrate for fatty acid
synthesis, in some tumor cells. For example, 13C labeled
NMR spectroscopy in human GBM cells demonstrate

not specific to GBMs, considerable evidence also exists
supporting metabolic cross-talk between stromal and
tumor cells. For example, lactate generated from stromal
cells can be taken up by tumor cells, which over-express
lactate transporters, and be used as fuel for metabolism
[13]. In addition, lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis
in stromal and tumor cells within hypoxic regions can be
used as an oxidative substrate by tumor cells in adjacent
regions where oxygen supply is greater [8, 14]. In addition
to enhanced glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis,
GBM cells also exhibit altered glutamine catabolism,
particularly within myc expressing cells [15, 16]. How
increased glutaminolysis and aerobic glycolysis contribute
to metabolic remodeling and provide growth and survival
advantage, is discussed below.

Putative
advantages
of
metabolic remodeling in GBMs
It was originally hypothesized that the predominant
advantage of the Warburg Effect was enhanced glycolytic
flux resulting in significantly faster production of ATP
per mole of glucose. This would ensure that ATP levels
met the demands of highly proliferating tumor cells,
particularly in an hypoxic environment. However,
evidence suggests that no matter the extent of cell division,
tumor cells maintain high ATP to ADP ratios as well as
NADH/NAD+, supporting that ATP is never limiting in
these cells [17, 18]. Furthermore, under non-stressful
conditions when resources are not scarce, ATP would be
more efficiently provided by OXPHOS. This suggests
other growth and survival advantages exist for tumor cell
metabolic remodeling.

Substrates for biosynthetic/anabolic pathways
In order for tumor cells to proliferate, they require
nucleotides, fatty acids, membrane lipids, and proteins
in addition to ATP. Therefore, alterations in tumor
cell metabolism assist in the synthesis of biosynthetic
precursors [19] to make these macromolecules. Increased
glutaminolysis and accelerated aerobic glycolysis
provides a constant supply of metabolic intermediates
necessary for macromolecule biosynthesis that facilitates
cell growth and proliferation [20]. Two major biosynthetic
activities required by proliferating cells is the production
of ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) for nucleotide biosynthesis
and fatty acids for lipid synthesis (Figure 1).
To generate R5P towards nucleic acid synthesis,
tumor cells divert carbon from glycolysis into the
oxidative or non-oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate
pathway (PPP). Tight regulation at different steps of
glycolysis, including the enzymes phosphofructokinase
1 (PFK1 by TIGAR), phosphoglycerate mutase (by p53)
and pyruvate kinase M2 (by growth factor signaling), can

glutamine to contribute to the bulk of anaplerotic carbon
to the TCA cycle [15, 28]. In addition, glutaminolysis also
results in export of glutamine-derived malate for NAPDH
production by cytoplasmic malic enzyme (ME1 gene)
which converts malate to pyruvate and is also a SREBP-1

target. In summary, glutamine metabolism as an anaplerotic
precursor and source of NAPDH results in the secretion of
a large quantity of glutamine-derived carbon and nitrogen
as lactate and alanine. There are other potential sources
of NAPDH including G6PD from the oxidative arm of

TCGA (http://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/tcga/dataAccessMatrix.htm?mode=ApplyFilter&showMatrix=false). In Brief, array files from TCGA batch
8 (HG-U133A Affymetrix Array platform) which contains 25 GBM samples (group1) and 10 Normal brain samples (group2) were imported
into Affymetrix Gene Expression Console. Normal brain and GBMs were compared against each other for differential gene expression using
significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) (False Discovery Rate of 10% and a minimum fold change of 2). Genes of various metabolic
processes from the significantly identified gene list were extracted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. This analysis does not discern differentially
expressed genes at the protein level, protein modifications or mutations. See Supplemental Table for TCGA sample ID’s used in this review.

PPP and cytosolic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2. The
relative importance of these metabolic pathways and
their associated enzymes in tumor remodeling and tumor
growth is currently unclear and under study.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has characterized
a large cohort of human GBM tumors with respect to
transcript and microRNA expression, chromosomal copy
number, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), methylation,
and sequencing. Early reports from the TCGA reinforce
previous knowledge of the importance of deregulation
of Rb, p53 and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/PI3K/
Ras pathways in GBMs [41]. The large-scale analysis
also highlighted the importance of NF1 deletions and
inactivation mutations of PIK3CA among others in GBM.
The array files from TCGA batch 8 (HG-U133A
Affymetrix Array platform) were mined to look at
differentially up- and down-regulated metabolism
associated genes relative to normal brain with respect
to: 1) glucose metabolism 2) fatty acid metablism 3)
nucleotide metabolism 4) glutamine metabolism, and
evaluated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Table
1 depicts a subset of significantly up- and down-regulated
genes relating to these four metabolic processes according
to IPA. For enzymes related to glycolysis, Hexokinase
2 (HK2) was significantly up-regulated while normal
brain HK1 is down-regulated. Isocitrate dehydrogenase
1 (IDH1) transcript levels are also elevated while
mitochondrial IDH3a are down-regulated. Of interest,
several of the enzymes required for glutaminolysis are
down-regulated in GBMs including glutaminase (GLS)
and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (GLUD1,2). The
role of many of these differentially expressed metabolic
related genes in GBM growth and survival remains to be
discovered.

Cell survival
In addition to providing substrates for biosynthetic
reactions, aerobic glycolysis provides a cell survival
advantage to tumor cells through several different, yet
interrelated mechanisms. This metabolic remodeling to
aerobic glycolysis facilitates adaptation of tumor cells
to conditions of fluctuating oxygen levels resulting from
altered vascularity [29]. First, the glycolytic phenotype
is associated with enhanced mitochondrial membrane
polarization (i.e. hyperpolarized) and resistance to
mitochondrial membrane permeability [30, 31].
Glycolytic enzymes directly regulate the mitochondrial
permeability transition pore (PTP) by interacting with the
voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC). For example,
the glycolytic enzyme Hexokinase 2 (HK2) can localize
to the outer mitochondrial membrane and interact with the
mitochondrial PTP, in response to Akt pathway activation,
thereby regulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [32,
33]. Our experiments demonstrate this also to occur in
GBMs, which aberrantly overexpress HK2, compared
to lower grade gliomas or normal brain. Complete or
even partial loss of OXPHOS by metabolic remodeling
of tumor cells to aerobic glycolysis can also induce
resistance to apoptosis by suppressing the activation of
pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, important mediators
of mitochondrial membrane permeability (MMP) [34].
Second, the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), which promote apoptosis, is decreased by tumor
cell remodeling to aerobic glycolysis. The resultant
decreased ROS and generation of lactate by aerobic
glycolysis protects tumor cells from oxidative stress [35,
36]. Other mechanisms of modulating ROS levels include
loss of p53 regulation of the enzyme TIGAR, resulting in
enhanced apoptosis likely due to increases in ROS [37].
Additionally, enhanced formation of G6P results in greater
flux into the PPP to generate NAPDH, which reinforces
the tumor cells antioxidant defenses and protects them
from ROS mediated apoptosis [37, 38].
Furthermore, by favouring aerobic glycolysis,
tumor cells generate bicarbonic and lactic acids. These
are exported from the cell and render the extracellular
environment more acidic, potentially favouring tumor
invasion by pH-dependent activation of cathepsins and
metalloproteinases [39] and suppressing anti-cancer
immune effectors such as T cells [40].

The
molecular
basis
of
metabolic remodeling: the role
of metabolic enzymes in GBM
The molecular basis of altered metabolism is likely
to be multi-factorial and cancer type dependent. Several
reviews have been published detailing the role of the
tumor microenvironment and stabilization of HIF1α [42],
growth factor/PI3K/AKT [43], and p53 [44] in metabolic
remodeling. However, specific metabolic enzymes
have been implicated downstream in establishing the
Warburg effect. Primary mutations, altered isoform
expression profile, and altered regulation/function
secondary to oncogenic signaling pathways or the tumor
microenvironment are potential mechanisms resulting
in the deregulation of metabolic enzymes with ensuing
metabolic modification.

Mutant IDH1
Altered metabolism has the potential of both
1) initiating carcinogenesis and 2) being crucial for
the progression of cancer. Mutations of the IDH
metabolic enzyme family is very frequent and an

early genetic alteration in lower grade astrocytomas
and oligodendrogliomas [45, 46]. Other than gliomas,
mutations in IDH1 have only been reported in Acute
Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) [47], suggesting a
potential role in tumor initiation. This mutation was
identified at residue R132 in IDH1 (and analogous R172
in IDH2) located within the isocitrate (substrate) binding
site, and is commonly mutated to histidine (R172H).
The somatic mutation of R132 residue occurs in greater
than 80% of lower grade II and III astrocytomas and
oligodendrogliomas as well as secondary GBMs that
develop from these lower grade lesions [45, 46, 48-51].
Mutation analysis of IDH2, which are much rarer, revealed
somatic mutations at the analogous R172IDH2 residue,
with most mutations occurring in tumors that lacked
IDH1 mutations [46, 48]. Of interest, TCGA analysis has
grouped GBMs into four subtypes including classical,
mesenchymal, proneural and neural, with some associated
molecular characteristics and clinical prognostics to the
groups. IDH1 mutations were predominantly associated
with the proneural subtype, which does have a better
overall prognosis [52].
Watanabe and colleagues reported that IDH1
mutations always preceded acquisition of TP53
mutations (in astrocytomas) and loss of 1p/19q (in
oligodendrogliomas) [51]. These results suggest that
IDH mutations are early genetic events in a cell of origin
that gives rise to both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.
Clinically, GBM patients with IDH mutations are
significantly younger and have a median overall survival
of 31 months compared to 15 months in patients with
wild-type IDH [46]. Multivariate analysis confirmed that
IDH1 mutations are an independent favourable prognostic
indicator even when adjusting for age, MGMT status, and
treatment [53]. As a whole, it appears that IDH1 and IDH2
mutations may define a specific subtype of disease with a
specific pattern of genetic mutations (e.g. TP53) not seen in
primary GBMs (e.g. PTEN, EGFR, CDKN2A/CDKN2B).
This data has to be taken in the context of the well-known
fact that secondary GBMs have a better prognosis than the
primary GBMs, which are most prevalent and hence by
itself does not provide clear evidence that IDH1 mutation
is somehow involved in more favourable GBM biology. Of
interest, IDH mutations have not been reported in pediatric
GBMs, furthering the thesis that pediatric GBMs, which
are much more rare but relatively a common and lethal
pediatric CNS tumor, arises from different molecular
pathways than adults. Much research is required for our
understanding of the molecular biology of these pediatric
GBMs, as they do not respond to therapies which have
shown some efficacy in adults.
IDH1 mutations occur in only a single allele
(i.e. heterozygotic), suggesting the mutation acts in an
oncogenic manner rather than being part of a typical
tumor suppressor mutation to promote tumorgenesis. The
mechanism(s) of this hypothesized oncogenic activity of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the mutation is currently not well-known and subject of
much research. First, IDH1 mutation impairs the ability
of IDH1 to convert isocitrate to KG [46, 54] and results in
decreased generation of αKG and subsequent stabilization
of HIF1α [54], which is well known to promote
angiogenesis and invasion. Second, IDH1 mutations
result in the neomorphic enzyme catalyzing the NADPHdependent reduction of αKG to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate
(2HG) [55]. 2-HG metabolite levels are elevated in glioma
specimens [55], with increased 2HG having several
potential effects on tumor cells: 1) increased ROS levels
due to decreased NADPH, 2) toxicity from competitively
inhibiting αKG and glutamate using enzymes including
a) transaminases necessary for utilization of glutamate
nitrogen for amino and nucleic acid biosynthesis, b) prolyl
hydroxylases that regulate HIF1α. To date, it remains
unclear how 2HG accumulation promotes the Warburg
effect in GBMs, if at all. Elevated 2HG levels in tumor
tissues with associated sera may be a potential biomarker
to help identify GBM patients with IDH1 mutations, but
to date this has not proven true in GBMs, unlike AML
patients sera, which of course is markedly different as a
liquid rather than solid cancer.
Of great interest is the observation that production
of 2HG does not solely arise from mutations of IDH1 and
IDH2. Patients suffering from hereditary Hydroxyglutaric
aciduria have loss of function in genes involved in the
oxidation of 2HG to αKG. These patients are deficient for
either L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (L2HGDH)
or R-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (R2HGDH).
Patients deficient in L2HGDH carry an increased risk for
developing brain tumours [56]. Using this as a rationale
to explain alternate methods of 2HG production, a recent
study examined secondary GBMs and other CNS tumours
for inactivating mutations of D2HGDH or L2HGDH.
This study was unable to identify any somatic mutations,
tumour associated polymorphisms or epigenetic silencing
of D2HGDH or L2HGDH [57] in patients lacking IDH1
or IDH2 mutations [57]. Originally identified as somatic
mutations, a separate study has detected heterozygous
germline mutations in IDH2 that alter enzyme residue
R140 in 15 unrelated patients with d-2-hydroxyglutaric
aciduria. This may support recent lines of evidence that
IDH1/2 mutations may be causal of tumour initiation in
germline syndromes such as hydroxyglutaric aciduria
[58]. The impact of IDH1/2 mutations on metabolic
remodeling and aerobic glycolysis remains an avenue of
intense investigation.

Hexokinase 2
If IDH1 mutations play an important role in the
Warburg effect and metabolic remodeling, the clear
evidence for which is lacking, this would still only explain
less than 10-15% of all GBMs, implying a role for other
regulators. An important role of the glycolytic enzyme

HK2 was first demonstrated in hepatomas in which it was
shown that the glucokinase isoform expressed in liver
is substituted by HK2 [59]. Similarly, several reports
including TCGA dataset support up-regulation of HK2 in
GBMs [60] and our own work (Wolf et al., under review),
with variable levels of HK1 expressed in normal brain. As
the first enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, HK controls
glucose flux into glycolysis or the PPP. HK2 is a highly
regulated form of hexokinase, whose transcript is regulated
by HIF1α, glucose, insulin, glucagon, cAMP, p53, among
others [61]. Mitochondrial binding of HK2 to the outer
membrane promotes its stability and reduces feedback
inhibition from its product G6P [62]. HK2 interacts with
VDAC at the mitochondria and regulates the release of
cytochrome c and intrinsic apoptosis, although the exact
mechanisms of this association are not well understood
[32, 63].
Our data supports that HK2 plays an important role
in establishing the glycolytic phenotype in GBMs. We
have shown that stable depletion of HK2 in GBM cells
inhibits aerobic glycolysis and promotes normal oxidative
glucose metabolism, reflected by decreased extracellular
lactate, increased expression of OXPHOS proteins and
increased O2 consumption (Wolf et al, under review).
Associated with a return in oxidative glucose metabolism
is a sensitization to cell death inducers including radiation
and temozolomide. Over-expression of HK2 in GBM
cells promotes proliferation and lactate formation and
is dependent on both its mitochondrial localization and
kinase activity. The addition of the isoform HK1 to cells
depleted of HK2 does not rescue the aerobic glycolytic
phenotype despite a return in total hexokinase activity,
supporting a unique role of HK2 over HK1 in GBM
growth. Reduction of HK2 expression in GBM cells has a
pronounced impact on in vivo anti-tumorgenicity in both
subcutaneous and intracranial xenograft models (Wolf
et al, under review). Furthermore, HK2 translocation to
the mitochondria is regulated by growth factor induced
oncogenic signaling pathways, such as increased EGFR
and PI3K/AKT activation, known to be aberrant in GBMs
[64].
Interestingly, in a recent report comparing the
expression profile of primary breast cancers with unlinked
brain metastasis, HK2 was found to be consistently upregulated in the brain metastatic tumors but not the
primary breast cancers. This supports that there are
important micro-environmental influences perhaps unique
to the brain that may be promoting HK2 expression and
tumor growth [65].

(L, R, M1 and M2). PKM1 and PKM2 are alternatively
spliced transcripts of the PKM2 gene. PKM1 is primarily
expressed in the brain and muscle while PKM2 is found in
proliferating tissues including embryonic tissue and tumor
cells [66]. Cantley and colleagues reported the preferential
expression of the embryonic PKM2 splice variant, rather
than adult PKM1, in a panel of cancer cell lines [17]. The
tumor specific PKM2 oscillates between an active tetramer
and a less active dimer, regulated by phosphotyrosine
binding, although the details of this regulation have yet
to be deciphered [67, 68]. The decreased activity of the
PKM dimer may result in shunting of upstream glycolytic
intermediates into biosynthetic pathway, including lipid
synthesis [68]. Furthermore, it is not clear how tumor cells
generate lactate if glucose is shuttled into biosynthetic
pathways, although anaplerotic reactions may be crucial.
PKM2-expressing cells with reduced PK activity may
favour the PEP-dependent histidine phosphorylation of the
glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM1),
providing an alternative glycolytic pathway favouring
anabolic metabolism [69]. Isoform selective inhibition
of PKM2 using small molecular inhibitors is reportedly
feasible by targeting its unique region for allosteric
regulation with limited effects on PKM1 [70]. GBM cells
do express high levels of PKM2 but also express PKM1
supporting an incomplete switch in splice isoforms. Knock
down of total PKM2 does not favour the switch in GBM
metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS, unlike
knockdown of HK2 (Wolf et al., under review).

PDK
Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a mitochondrial
multi-enzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidative
decarboxylation of pyruvate, whose enzymatic activity is
regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle.
The mitochondrial matrix protein Pyruvate dehyrogenase
kinase (PDK1 to 4) is an important inhibitor of OXPHOS
via its phosphorylation of the E1 alpha subunit of PDH.
HIF1α transactivates PDK1 resulting in decreased
conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coA and compromising
OXPHOS [71]. Treatment of cancer cells with the small
molecule inhibitor of PDK dichloroacetate (DCA),
currently employed for the treatment of congenital lactic
acidosis, was found to activate OXPHOS and promote
apoptosis in cancer cells [72]. DCA is believed to
sensitize to apoptosis via two mechanisms: 1) enhanced
flux of electrons through the ETC resulting in greater
depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, which is
generally hyperpolarized in tumor cells, and enhanced
release of apoptotic cytochrome c; 2) return in OXPHOS
function generating greater ROS, up-regulating voltagedependent K+ channel leading to an efflux of K+ and
activation of caspases [72]. DCA, which crosses the
blood-brain barrier, has been administered in a small
number of GBM patients with limited toxicity aside

PKM2
Pyruvate kinase (PK) is the last irreversible step
of glycolysis, catalyzing the reaction of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate. Humans contain two
PK genes (PKLR and PKM2) and four PK isozymes

from a dose-dependent, reversible peripheral neuropathy
[73]. However, large, randomized controlled trials are
warranted to ascertain its effectiveness in GBM patients.
Furthermore, whether DCA can sensitize GBM cells to
temozolomide or radiation remains to be determined.

Therapeutic targeting in GBM
The metabolic divergence between GBM and
normal cells may provide novel therapeutic strategies
to be exploited. Increasing tumorigenicity correlates
with greater sensitivity to glycolytic inhibitors [74]. As
depicted in Figure 1, any number of steps in glucose
metabolism may act as putative therapeutic targets, with
varying extent of side effects. However, upon screening of
TCGA data, only a few enzymes are strongly up-regulated
relative to normal brain, which includes HK2.
Selective targeting of HK2 may have dual effects on
cells by inhibiting glycolysis and promoting OXPHOS
thereby impacting proliferation as well as dissociating
the anti-apoptotic interaction between HK2 and VDAC.
Current agents targeting HK2 (e.g. 3-bromopyruvate,
2-deoxyglucose) have limited clinical potential in GBMs
due to non-specificity (e.g. impact on HK1 or other
metabolic proteins) and systemic toxicity. Newer agents
are currently under development aimed at interfering
more selectively the interaction between HK2 and VDAC
(e.g. methyl jasmonate) [75]. However, to date, no specific
inhibitor of HK2 has been developed. It also remains to
be investigated whether combined targeting of metabolic
enzymes, including inhibitors to HK2, PKM2 and DCA
for PDK, will further enhance GBM cell death.
Future studies should strive to investigate the
impact of inhibition of specific enzymes (e.g. with DCA)
on metabolic network as a whole including fatty acid,
nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Metabolomics
can assist in the quantification of metabolites in cells,
tissues or sera, which may be particularly informative in
pathologically heterogeneous human GBM tissues. The
metabolomic profile could then be correlated with the
transcript or proteomic profile of corresponding tissues,
potentially yielding novel diagnostic or prognostic
markers. Understanding how these metabolic networks
vary and their importance for proliferation and resistance
to cell death may identify further targeted therapeutic
strategies for GBM patients.
