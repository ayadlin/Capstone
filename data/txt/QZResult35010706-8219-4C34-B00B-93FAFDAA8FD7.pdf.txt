Abstract
Administration of caffeine was shown in earlier studies to
enhance UVB-induced apoptosis and inhibit UVB-induced
carcinogenesis in hairless SKH-1 mice. Here, we describe
a potential mechanism for these in vivo effects. A single
irradiation of mouse skin with UVB activated the ataxiatelangiectasia mutated– and Rad3-related (ATR) pathway,
causing a severalfold increase in keratinocytes with phosphoChk1 (Ser345) and a marked decrease in mitotic keratinocytes with cyclin B1 compared with baseline. When given in
the drinking water for 1 to 2 weeks before UVB, caffeine
(0.4 mg/mL) markedly inhibited the UVB-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser345 and caused premature expression of
cyclin B1 in the epidermis. Normal keratinocytes had delayed
mitotic entry for >10 h following UVB. Caffeine administration
reduced this mitotic delay to only 4 h and caused markedly
increased apoptosis by 6 to 10 h after UVB. p53 knockout mice
were used to determine the role of p53 in these processes.
Irradiation with UVB markedly decreased the number of
mitotic keratinocytes with cyclin B1 in p53 knockout mice,
and topical caffeine immediately after UVB abrogated this
response and increased UVB-induced apoptosis severalfold.
These effects of caffeine in knockout mice were substantially
greater than in wild-type mice. The ability of caffeine to
promote the deletion of p53/ keratinocytes may be relevant
to its inhibitory effect on UVB-induced skin cancer. Our
studies indicate that administration of caffeine enhances
the removal of DNA-damaged cells by inhibiting the ATRmediated phosphorylation of Chk1 and prematurely increasing the number of cyclin B1–containing cells that undergo
lethal mitosis. [Cancer Res 2008;68(7):2523–9]

Introduction
In earlier studies, we showed an inhibitory effect of p.o.
administration of green or black tea on the formation of UVBinduced keratoacanthomas and squamous cell carcinomas in
SKH-1 hairless mice (1, 2). The regular teas were more effective
than the decaffeinated teas, adding back caffeine to the decaffeinated teas restored their inhibitory activities, and administration of
caffeine alone strongly inhibited tumor formation (3, 4). These
results indicated that caffeine is a major component of tea
responsible for its inhibitory effect on UVB-induced tumor

formation in mice. Mechanistic studies indicated that p.o.
administration of green tea or black tea to tumor-bearing mice
enhanced apoptosis in skin tumors and inhibited their growth
(5, 6). P.o. administration of green tea or caffeine for 2 weeks before
a single irradiation with UVB enhanced UVB-induced increases in
epidermal wild-type p53 protein and apoptosis in the epidermis of
SKH-1 mice (7). In addition, topical application of caffeine
immediately after a single irradiation with UVB also enhanced
UVB-induced apoptosis, but this treatment had only a small
stimulatory effect on UVB-induced increases in wild-type p53 in the
epidermis (8). In this study, caffeine was given immediately after
UVB to prevent a possible sunscreen effect. P.o. or topical
administration of caffeine had a selective proapoptotic effect on
UVB-treated skin and did not affect apoptosis in the epidermis of
normal non–UVB-treated skin (7, 8). In additional studies, we found
that topical application of caffeine to p53/ or bax/ mice
enhanced UVB-induced apoptosis by a p53- and bax-independent
mechanism (9).
Cell culture studies indicate that DNA damage activates a wildtype p53-dependent G1 checkpoint and a p53-independent G2
checkpoint. Activation of these checkpoints inhibits cell division
and allows time for DNA repair before mitosis, thereby preventing
the propagation of DNA-damaged cells. Cell culture studies have
also shown that treatment of DNA-damaged cells with caffeine
overrides the G2 checkpoint, thereby preventing cells from arresting
in G2, and this effect of caffeine results in attempted replication of
the DNA-damaged cells that results in cell death (10–13).
Cell culture studies indicate that cyclin B1 accumulates during
the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, and these changes
are associated with an increase in cyclin B1 mRNA levels
(14) and a decrease in protein degradation (15–18). Treatment
of the cells with a DNA-damaging agent, such as hydroxyurea
or UV, decreases the level of cyclin B1 as well as mRNA for
cyclin B1, and these treatments prevent entry into mitosis by
both an ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATM- and Rad3related (ATR)–dependent and an ATM/ATR-independent
mechanism (15).
Because most (but not all) cell culture studies suggest the
importance of the ATR/Chk1/cyclin B1 signal transduction
pathway for the effects of caffeine in overcoming the DNA
damage–induced G2 cell cycle arrest (see Discussion), we hypothesize that a key component of the proapoptotic effect of caffeine
in the epidermis of UVB-treated mice is inhibition of the
UVB!ATR!Chk1!cdc25c! cdc2!cdc2/cyclin B1 pathway that
normally results in a decrease in cdc2/cyclin B1 activity (increased
phospho-cdc2/cyclin B1 and decreased dephospho-cdc2/cyclin B1)
and an arrest before mitosis. In the presence of caffeine, this arrest
should be abrogated (cdc2/cyclin B1 level should be increased
despite UVB) and cells should proceed into mitosis prematurely
leading to p53-independent chromatin condensation and cell death
(13, 19), probably by mitotic catastrophe followed by apoptosis, as

suggested by Brown and Attardi (20) and by others (see Fig. 1;
refs. 21–23). The results described here provide support for this
hypothesis by indicating that administration of caffeine stimulates
UVB-induced apoptosis, inhibits UVB-induced phosphorylation of
Chk1 on Ser345, and curtails the UVB-induced decrease in mitotic
cells with cyclin B1 in the epidermis that occurs shortly after UVB
irradiation.

Materials and Methods
Exposure of mice to UV and the preparation of serial sections of
skin. Female SKH-1 hairless mice, 6 to 8 wk of age, were fed a Purina
Laboratory Chow 5001 diet and irradiated with UV lamps (FS72T12-UVBHO; National Biological Corp.) that emit UVB (280–320 nm; 75–80% of total
energy) and UVA (320–375 nm; 20–25% of total energy) as described in our
earlier studies (1). Skin samples (20 mm long; 5 mm wide), which also
contained associated dermis, were taken from the middle of the back and
placed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin at 4jC for 18 to 24 h followed by
washing and storing in 75% ethanol until the samples were processed for
histology as described earlier (7).
All histologic and immunohistochemical determinations were performed
with 400-fold magnification and scored blind by two investigators (Y-P.L.
and Y-R.L.), who evaluated coded samples randomly. Good agreement was
obtained between the two investigators, and the mean value obtained from
the examination of multiple fields by each investigator was determined for
each mouse and used in the calculation of mean F SE for the mice in each
group. Each microscope field (40-fold magnification) was approximately
equivalent to a 0.5-mm length of epidermis.

Figure 1. Proposed effects of UVB and caffeine on the ATR/Chk1/cyclin B1
pathway and premature chromatin condensation. The signal that DNA synthesis
is not complete (and that chromatin condensation and mitosis should not start)
is sent by ATR after it is recruited to stalled replication forks that have been
coated by replication protein A. ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 results
in a decreased level and function of cyclin B1, which delays mitotic entry and
prevents premature chromatin condensation and mitosis. Inhibition of the
ATR/Chk1 pathway in UVB-treated cells should result in a premature increase
in cyclin B1 and premature chromatin condensation, mitosis, and cell death,
probably by mitotic catastrophe followed by apoptosis, as suggested by
Brown and Attardi (20). Adapted with permission from Nghiem et al. (13).

Measurement of apoptotic and mitotic cells in the epidermis.
Identification of apoptotic sunburn cells was based morphologically on cell
shrinkage and nuclear condensation attributable to fragmentation of the
cells (24, 25). Earlier studies showed that sunburn cells are indeed apoptotic
cells (26). Apoptotic sunburn cells were identified in the epidermis by their
intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm and small, dense nuclei, which were
observed in H&E-stained histologic sections of the skin using light
microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic sunburn cells in the epidermis
(basal plus suprabasal layers) was calculated from the number of these cells
per 100 cells counted from the entire 20-mm length of epidermis for each
skin section.
Cells undergoing mitosis were determined as described earlier (6).
Mitotic cells were determined by observing (a) chromosome condensation
together with breakdown of the nuclear envelope, (b) alignment of the
chromosomes on the spindle equator, (c) separation of sister chromatids,
and (d) movement to their respective spindle poles. Two separate
nonadjacent skin sections from each mouse were analyzed, and an
average value for the mitotic index and percentage of apoptotic cells was
calculated.
Phospho-Chk1 and cyclin B1 immunostaining in the epidermis. The
antibody used for the immunohistochemical detection of phospho-Chk1
(Ser345) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (cat. no. sc-17922), and the
antibody used for the immunohistochemical measurement of cyclin B1 was
from Abcam (cat. no. ab72).
Skin sections were stained by the Biotin-Streptavidin Amplified System
(alkaline phosphatase–conjugated streptavidin) using StrAviGen Super
Sensitive Universal immunostaining kit purchased from Biogenex, with
some modifications. Paraffin sections were first treated with 0.01 mol/L
sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven at high temperature for
10 min for phospho-Chk1 or cyclin B1 staining. The sections were then
incubated with a protein block (normal goat serum) for 10 min at room
temperature. The sections were incubated with phospho-Chk1 antibody
(1:100 dilution) or cyclin B1 antibody (1:500 dilution) for 1 h at room
temperature. The samples were then incubated with a biotinylated antirabbit secondary antibody for 5 min at 37jC followed by incubation with
conjugated streptavidin solution for 5 min at 37jC. Color development was
achieved by incubation with New Fuchsin Substrate Pack (containing
0.6 mg/mL levamisole solution; Biogenex) for 20 min at room temperature.
The slides were then counterstained with hematoxylin and dehydrated, and
coverslips were added for permanent mounting.
A positive reaction was shown as a brown precipitate in the cells. The
percentage of phospho-Chk1 or cyclin B1–positive cells in the epidermis
(combined basal and suprabasal layers) was calculated from the number of
phospho-Chk1–stained (nuclear staining) or cyclin B1–stained (staining in
nucleus and cytoplasm) positive cells per 100 cells counted from the entire
20-mm length of epidermis for each skin section.
Measurement of phospho-Chk1 (Ser345), phospho-Chk2 (Thr68),
cyclin B1, and phospho-cyclin B1 (Ser147) in the epidermis by Western
blots. Dorsal skin samples were removed and immediately placed in a
buffer solution containing 75 mmol/L dibasic sodium phosphate and
monobasic potassium phosphate (pH 7.7) at 52jC for 20 s. The samples
were then submerged immediately in an ice bath containing the same
buffer for 1 min. The epidermis was scraped from the dermis and placed in
1.2 mL of lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L Na2EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mmol/L sodium
pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 Ag/mL
leupeptin, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.). The epidermis was sonicated five times (5 s each time) at
4jC. Samples were centrifuged at 17,800  g for 20 min at 4jC. Equal
amounts of supernatant protein (40 Ag) were separated by SDS-PAGE (4%
stacking and 4–15% gradient) and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane. The blots were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBSTween 20 for 1 h and incubated with phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) antibody (1:250
dilution), phospho-Chk2 (Thr68) antibody (1:150 dilution), and cyclin B1
antibody (1:150 dilution). Blots were washed in PBS-Tween 20 and then
incubated with a 1:1,500 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody (Amersham) in PBS-Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Blots

were again washed in PBS-Tween 20 and then developed by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Amersham).
The antibody used for the measurement of phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) by
Western blot was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (cat. no. 2341),
and the antibody used for the measurement of phospho-Chk2 (Thr68) was
obtained from Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc. (cat. no. 600-401-280). The
antibody used for the measurement of cyclin B1 by Western blots was
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (cat. no. sc-752), and the antibody
used for the measurement of phospho-cyclin B1 (Ser147) by Western blots
was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (cat. no. 4131).

Results
Inhibitory effect of administration of caffeine or caffeine
sodium benzoate on UVB-induced increase in the level of
phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) in the epidermis of SKH-1 mice. In
recent studies, we identified caffeine sodium benzoate as a
complex of caffeine and sodium benzoate that is more active than
caffeine at enhancing UVB-induced apoptosis (27). Our hypothesis
predicts that administration of caffeine or caffeine sodium
benzoate will inhibit UVB-induced activation of the ATR/Chk1
pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser345,
thereby leading to increased cyclin B1, premature chromatin
condensation, premature mitosis, and cell death in DNA-damaged
cells (see Fig. 1).
P.o. administration of caffeine (0.4 mg/mL, 2.1 mmol/L) or
caffeine sodium benzoate (2.1 mmol/L) in the drinking water to
SKH-1 mice for 1 week before exposure to UVB (30 mJ/cm2)
markedly inhibited the UVB-induced increase in the level of
phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) at 6 h after UVB, but there was little or no
effect on the level of phospho-Chk2 (Thr68) as measured by
Western blots (Fig. 2). Administration of caffeine or caffeine
sodium benzoate had little or no effect on the level of phosphoChk1 (Ser345) in the absence of UVB (Fig. 2). Densitometry
measurements on Western blots from the epidermis in three
separate experiments indicated that treatment with UVB plus
caffeine or UVB plus caffeine sodium benzoate decreased the level
of phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) by an average of 82% and 99%,
respectively, compared with animals that received only UVB
irradiation at 6 h after UVB (Fig. 2B).
In a time course study, p.o. administration of caffeine (0.4 mg/mL
in the drinking water) to SKH-1 mice for 2 weeks increased UVBinduced apoptosis at 6 to 10 h after UVB (Fig. 3A) and inhibited the
UVB-induced increase in the number of phospho-Chk1 (Ser345)–
positive cells at 6 to 16 h after UVB (Fig. 3B).
Effect of administration of caffeine or caffeine sodium
benzoate on UVB-induced changes in cyclin B1 and mitotic
cells with cyclin B1 in the epidermis of SKH-1 mice. We
evaluated the possibility that administration of caffeine enhanced
UVB-induced apoptosis through abrogation of the cell cycle
blockade at the G2-M checkpoint by elevating epidermal cyclin
B1 prematurely, thereby causing premature and lethal mitosis in
the epidermis of UVB-treated animals (see Fig. 1). Irradiation of
control mice with UVB (30 mJ/cm2) in the absence of caffeine
resulted in a 38% decrease in the number of cyclin B1–positive cells
(nuclear staining) at 6 h after UVB, and there was an even greater
decrease in the number of mitotic cells with cyclin B1 (Fig. 3C
and D). Irradiation with UVB (30 mJ/cm2) decreased the number of
epidermal mitotic cells with cyclin B1 by 61% at 2 h after UVB, 62%
at 4 h after UVB, 75% at 6 h after UVB, and 75% at 10 h after UVB
(Fig. 3D), which allowed time for DNA repair before increased
mitosis that occurred at later times after UVB exposure. P.o.

before UVB irradiation blocked the normal UVB-induced decrease

to 10 h after UVB as measured by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3C

stained for cyclin B1 is shown in Fig. 4.
Our results show that p.o. administration of caffeine for 2 weeks
before UVB irradiation increased the number of cyclin B1–stained
cells in UVB-treated mice compared with control mice irradiated
with UVB, and the time course for this effect of caffeine
administration on cyclin B1 was similar to the time course for
the inhibitory effect of caffeine on the UVB-induced increase in
phospho-Chk1 (Ser345; Fig. 3B and C) and for the time course for
the stimulatory effect of caffeine on UVB-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 3A). Enhanced chromatin condensation (attempted mitosis)
of DNA-damaged cells before repair and at an inappropriate early
stage of the cell cycle would be expected to enhance cell death
(Fig. 1). Our results indicate that administration of caffeine

overcame the prolonged UVB-induced decrease in the percentage
of mitotic cells with cyclin B1 that normally occurred after UVB
(Fig. 3D). This effect of caffeine was associated with an increased
level of cyclin B1 and enhanced early and inappropriate mitosis in
the caffeine-treated mice.
It was of interest that the total number of mitotic cells in the
epidermis after UVB or in the epidermis of mice pretreated with
caffeine before UVB irradiation closely resembled the number of
mitotic cells with cyclin B1 (data not presented). These results
indicate that most mitotic epidermal cells in this study also had
elevated cyclin B1.
P.o. administration of caffeine or caffeine sodium benzoate to
SKH-1 mice for 1 week before exposure to UVB increased the level
of cyclin B1 at 6 h after UVB when compared with the level of
cyclin B1 in control mice irradiated with UVB as measured by
Western blots at 6 h after UVB (Fig. 2). This treatment with caffeine
or caffeine sodium benzoate, however, had little or no effect on the
level of phospho-cyclin B1 (Ser147; Fig. 2). Densitometry measurements on Western blots from the epidermis in three separate
experiments as shown in Fig. 2 indicate that treatment with UVB
plus caffeine or UVB plus caffeine sodium benzoate increased the
level of cyclin B1 by an average of 153% and 201%, respectively,
above the level of cyclin B1 in the epidermis of animals that
received only UVB irradiation.
In another study, topical application of caffeine or caffeine

B1 (relative to UVB-treated control animals) all started at 6 h after
UVB, and the greatest differences between UVB-treated control
animals and UVB plus caffeine–treated animals occurred between
6 and 10 h after UVB (Fig. 3). Although the caffeine-induced
increase in apoptosis in UVB-irradiated mice was maximal between
6 and 10 h after UVB and then declined (Fig. 3A), caffeine
continued to affect UVB-induced changes in phospho-Chk1 (Ser345)
and cells with cyclin B1 beyond 10 h (Fig. 3B and C). Decreases in
apoptosis before the peak effects of caffeine on phospho-Chk1 and

cyclin B1 may occur because of an antiapoptotic response after
10 h (such as an increase in E2F1, activated AKT, or survivin).
Treatment of SKH-1 mice with caffeine enhances UVB-induced
apoptosis by both enhancing the level of p53 (7) and by a p53independent pathway involving premature mitosis (Figs. 3 and 5).
p53 is not required for caffeine-induced premature mitosis after
UVB irradiation as indicated in p53 knockout mice (Fig. 5). It is
important to note that the presence of a peak of cyclin B1–positive
cells does not by itself lead to apoptosis, but rather, cyclin B1–
positive cells that arise before 16 h after UVB (premature increase
in cyclin B1 and premature mitosis) is what leads to apoptosis in
caffeine-treated mice. In UVB plus water–treated mice, there is no
increase in cyclin B1–positive cells (mitotic cells with cyclin B1)
before 16 h (Fig. 3C and D). This indicates a functional ‘‘replication
checkpoint.’’ At 16 h, the water-treated mice had keratinocytes that
were undergoing mitosis as indicated by cyclin B1 expression; yet,
because they had 16 h to recover from UVB damage, there was no
corresponding increase in apoptosis (Fig. 3A, apoptosis is markedly
declining by 16 h). In contrast, caffeine caused ‘‘premature mitosis’’
(visible at 6 and 10 h after UVB), and it is this early mitosis that
then led to increased apoptosis in the caffeine-treated mice. The
fact that the caffeine-treated mice went on to have a peak in cyclin
B1–positive cells at 16 h but did not lead to apoptosis was because
these cells began mitosis later and had had sufficient time to
recover from UVB damage.
The data described in Fig. 3 at early time intervals after UVB
irradiation provide support for our hypothesis that caffeine
abrogates the UVB-induced blockade of the cell cycle at the
G2-M checkpoint by inhibiting the ATR/Chk1 pathway and
prematurely elevating cyclin B1 and mitosis, thereby resulting in
cell death (shown in Fig. 1).

Effects of caffeine on the time course for UVB-induced
changes in apoptosis and mitotic cells with cyclin B1 in the
epidermis of p53 knockout mice. In an earlier study, we found
that topical application of caffeine enhanced UVB-induced
apoptosis in p53/ C57BL/6J mice (9). In the present study, we
used stored paraffin blocks from our earlier study to determine
the time course for the effect of caffeine on UVB-induced changes
in the percentage of mitotic cells with cyclin B1 (Fig. 5D). The
results indicate a dramatic UVB-induced decrease in the
percentage of mitotic cells with cyclin B1 in p53/ mice between
2 and 16 h after UVB, and this decrease was abrogated starting at
6 h after UVB in mice that were treated topically with caffeine
immediately after UVB irradiation (Fig. 5D), indicating a p53independent effect of caffeine in enhancing the number of mitotic
cells with cyclin B1 at early times after UVB irradiation. The time
course for the stimulatory effect of caffeine administration on the
percentage of mitotic cells with cyclin B1 in p53 knockout mice
treated with UVB paralleled the time course for the formation of
apoptotic sunburn cells (Fig. 5C and D). The results also indicate
that the magnitude of the caffeine effect is greater in p53/ mice
than in their littermate wild-type mice (Fig. 5A and B versus
C and D).

In earlier studies, we found that p.o. administration of caffeine
inhibited UVB-induced carcinogenesis (3) and enhanced UVBinduced apoptosis by p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms (7–9). In the present study, we investigated the effect of
caffeine administration on UVB-induced activation of the p53independent ATR/Chk1 pathway that normally inhibits mitosis at
the G2-M checkpoint after exposure to UVB, thereby allowing the
cells time to repair their damaged DNA.
The mechanisms and molecular targets for the proapoptotic
effect of caffeine after DNA damage have been investigated in
cultured cell lines. A recent study indicated that ATR is an
important proapoptotic target for caffeine in human osteosarcoma
cells (13), and loss of p53 function sensitized these cells to
premature chromatin condensation caused by the ATR inhibitor
caffeine (13, 19). These investigators found that activation of ATR
after DNA damage prevented premature chromatin condensation
via Chk1 protein kinase regulation, and caffeine abrogated this
effect, which resulted in premature chromatin condensation (13).
Other studies indicated that caffeine directly disrupts the ATR/
Chk1 checkpoint pathway (28). The ATR protein has higher affinity
for DNA in UVB-damaged cells than for undamaged DNA, and
damaged DNA stimulates the kinase activity of ATR to a
significantly higher level than undamaged DNA (29).
Although the present study and others suggest that caffeine
overcomes the G2 checkpoint block by inhibiting the ATRdependent phosphorylation of Chk1, other mechanisms may also
play a role. A recent study indicated that although caffeine
inhibited ATM and ATR kinase activity in vitro, studies done with
cultured cells unexpectedly indicated that treatment with 2 to
8 mmol/L caffeine in combination with hydroxyurea stimulated
ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser345 (30). One
possible interpretation of this paradoxical result is that inhibition
of ATR by caffeine causes stalled replication forks to convert to
more severe forms of damage such as double-strand breaks,
paradoxically augmenting damage signaling (31). In a recent study,
5 mmol/L caffeine enhanced apoptosis in mitotic checkpoint-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

arrested HeLa cells by mechanisms that seem to be independent of
the ATR/Chk1/cyclin B1 signal transduction pathway (32).
Inhibition of p21-activated PAK1, with an antiapoptotic function,
was identified as a possible contributor to caffeine-induced
apoptosis (32). It is important to point out that most cell culture
studies used millimolar concentrations of caffeine that are 50- to
100-fold higher than what is achievable after p.o. administration of
caffeine to mice or humans, although these concentrations are
achievable after topical application.
In a recent study, we found that topical applications of caffeine
to mice with patches of epidermal cells with one or more UVBinduced p53 mutations enhanced the elimination of these patches
of p53-mutant cells (33). Interestingly, caffeine administration had
selectivity and enhanced the elimination of cells with a p53
mutation on both alleles to a greater extent than cells with a p53
mutation on only one allele (34). These in vivo results are
consistent with prior in vitro data that suggest a greater sensitivity
to cell death by caffeine or ATR inhibition in p53-defective cells
than in p53 wild-type cells (13).
Our results provide the first demonstration of an in vivo effect
of caffeine administration on the ATR/Chk1/cyclin B1 pathway in
animals, and this effect parallels the stimulatory effect of caffeine
administration on UVB-induced apoptosis. In the present study,
caffeine in the drinking water (0.4 mg/mL) given for 2 weeks
before UVB treatment inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of
epidermal Chk1 and abrogated the UVB-induced decrease in
mitotic cells with cyclin B1 as well as the decrease in total mitotic
cells. This is consistent with a model in which caffeine promotes
premature mitosis and apoptosis through blocking ATR function
as shown in the model in Fig. 1. Based on this model, we
anticipated that caffeine-induced increases in epidermal cyclin B1
may be associated with changes in cyclin B1 phosphorylation.
However, this was not observed using an antibody that can detect
phosphorylation at Ser147. It seems that the phosphorylation of
cyclin B1 at positions other than Ser147 plays an important role in
the control of the cell cycle as shown by the work of Yang et al.
(35). Cyclin B1 sites that are phosphorylated to promote nuclear
import include Ser94, Ser96, Ser101, and Ser113 (35); however,
phosphospecific antibodies have not been developed to investigate
this process.
We explored the possibility that the effects of caffeine on UVBinduced carcinogenesis were mediated by inhibition of phosphodiesterase and an increased level of cyclic AMP (cAMP). Topical
applications of 125 nmol of cAMP twice a day, 5 days a week for 21
weeks, to UVB-initiated high-risk mice had no effect on the percent
of mice with tumors or the number of tumors per mouse but tumor
size was increased (data not presented). In additional studies,
treatment of mice with topical applications of dibutyryl cAMP or
other compounds that increase cAMP had no effect on UVBinduced carcinogenesis (36). These studies indicate that alterations
in cAMP levels that could occur after caffeine administration are
not important for the inhibitory effect of caffeine on UVB-induced
carcinogenesis.
The dose of p.o. caffeine used in the present study (0.4 mg/mL in
the drinking water) as well as in earlier studies where caffeine
inhibited UVB-induced carcinogenesis gave an average plasma level
of f16 Amol/L (37), which is similar to that observed in people
drinking three to five cups of coffee per day, and some coffee
drinkers had much higher plasma levels of caffeine (38).
Epidemiology studies suggest that coffee drinkers and tea drinkers
have a lower risk of skin cancer (39–41). Whether drinking these

caffeine-containing beverages modifies UVB-induced apoptosis and
the ATR/Chk1 pathway in humans is unknown. Studies from our
laboratory showed that administration of caffeine or caffeine
sodium benzoate has sunscreen activity, increases the elimination
of DNA-damaged cells by apoptosis, and inhibits UVB-induced
carcinogenesis in SKH-1 mice (3, 4, 7, 8, 27, 42). Topical
applications of caffeine or caffeine sodium benzoate to UVBpretreated high-risk mice inhibited carcinogenesis in the absence
of further UVB treatment (4, 27, 42), and administration of caffeine
also enhanced apoptosis in the tumors (42). The results of these
studies suggest that caffeine and caffeine sodium benzoate may be
mechanistically novel agents for inhibiting sunlight-induced skin
cancer.

In summary, the present study indicates that administration of
caffeine to SKH-1 mice inhibits UVB-induced phosphorylation of
Chk1 and prematurely increases the number of mitotic cells with
cyclin B1 that are likely to go on to apoptosis. These effects are
associated with an increase in UVB-induced apoptosis and
inhibition of UVB-induced carcinogenesis.
