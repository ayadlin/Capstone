Abstract
Combination of innocuous dietary components with anticancer drugs is an emerging new strategy for cancer chemotherapy to increase antitumor responses. Tangeretin is a citrus
flavonoid known to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Here,
we show an enhanced response of A2780/CP70 and 2008/
C13 cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells to various
combination treatments of cisplatin and tangeretin. Pretreatment of cells with tangeretin before cisplatin treatment synergistically inhibited cancer cell proliferation. This combination
was effective in activating apoptosis via caspase cascade
as well as arresting cell cycle at G 2 -M phase. Moreover,
phospho-Akt and its downstream substrates, e.g., NF-κB,
phospho-GSK-3β, and phospho-BAD, were downregulated
upon tangeretin-cisplatin treatment. The tangeretin-cisplatin–
induced apoptosis in A2780/CP70 cells was increased by
phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibition and siRNAmediated Akt silencing, but reduced by overexpression of
constitutively activated Akt and GSK-3β inhibition. The overall results indicated that tangeretin exposure preconditions
cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells for a conventional response to low-dose cisplatin-induced cell death occurring through downregulation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
Thus, effectiveness of tangeretin combinations, as a promising
modality in the treatment of resistant cancers, warrants systematic clinical studies. [Cancer Res 2009;69(23):8910–7]

Introduction
Majority of patients with ovarian cancer are not effectively treated with standard cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II)] regimens primarily due to the obstacle posed by development of
drug resistance (1). Like most malignancies, intrinsic drug resistance of ovarian cancers could be attributed to multiple genetic
and/or epigenetic alterations resulting in the loss of tumor suppressor functions or dysregulation of survival signals (2). Identification and reversal of these traits offer valuable targets for
modulating the response of cancer cells. Development of new ef-

fective strategies based on transient targeted response modulation
is now in the forefront of cancer research to overcome drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy.
Among the current chemotherapy drug regimens, cisplatin represents one of the clinically most important antineoplastic agent
with anticancer activity against a wide variety of solid tumors (3).
The antineoplastic effect of cisplatin is mediated by the formation
of functionally lethal intrastrand DNA cross-links. These lesions activate damage response pathways that result in diverse effects including DNA synthesis inhibition, RNA transcription suppression,
cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Several mechanisms are responsible for cisplatin resistance. These include reduced platinum accumulation, enhanced platinum detoxification and metabolism,
altered DNA damage repair and, more importantly, the activation
of phospholipid kinase, phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt,
and other cellular survival signaling pathways ultimately causing
dysregulation of apoptotic pathway (4).
PI3K/Akt signal transduction plays a critical role in the control
of cell growth and proliferation (5). The increased Akt activation or
dysregulation due to elevated Akt expression and indirect changes
in Akt regulators results in stronger cell survival signaling, which is
a common feature in various forms of human cancers, including
human ovarian carcinoma (6, 7). Dozens of downstream substrates
of Akt kinase have been identified including those related to chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer cells, e.g., GSK-3β, BAD, and
transcription factor NF-κB, etc. These substrates directly or indirectly regulate apoptosis. GSK-3β, for example, is phosphorylated
by Akt, and GSK-3 itself is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, antiapoptotic pathways, and cell cycle progression (8–10).
BAD, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member (11), is an Akt target directly implicated in regulating cell survival (12). Phosphorylation of
BAD changes its affinity to Bcl-2 molecules and phospho-BAD (pBAD) is unable to inhibit Bcl-2 function (13, 14). Akt also regulates
NF-κB pathway via phosphorylation and activation of inhibitory
κ-B kinase and RelA (15, 16). The NF-κB transcription factors
themselves regulate several important physiologic processes, e.g.,
inflammation and immune responses, cell growth, and apoptosis.
Thus, inhibition of NF-κB activation offers a potential strategy for
treatment of different malignancies (17, 18).
Newer approaches using dietary flavonoids in combination therapies are being increasingly explored to achieve greater efficacy for
drug-resistant cancer cells. For instance, soy isoflavone genistein
has been shown to increase apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents in human cancer cells through inactivation of NF-κB via
downregulating Akt pathway (19). Flavonoids alone have also been
shown to induce apoptosis in some cancer cells, while sparing
normal cells (20). Several mechanisms have been suggested for flavonoid-induced apoptosis, including inhibition of topoisomerase I/II

Tangeretin-Mediated Cisplatin Sensitization

Figure 1. Synergism of tangeretin-cisplatin combination is dependent on the drug administration sequence. A2780/CP70 (A) and 2008/C13 (B) were treated with
different concentrations of cisplatin and tangeretin in the indicated drug administration sequences. Cells were allowed to grow for 72 h and cell growth was determined by
MTT assay. CI and normalized isobologram were calculated and processed using CalcuSyn software. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, CI of drug combination where cisplatin to
tangeretin ratios were 1:16.67, 1:25.00, 1:33.33, 1:50.00, and 1:25.00, respectively. C, cells were treated with tangeretin 24 h before cisplatin (columns 5 and 6) or with

activity (21–24), regulation of expression of heat shock (25) and Bcl-2
family proteins (26–29), activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (22),
and modulation of Akt signaling and NF-κB activation (30).
Tangeretin (Supplementary Fig. S1), a polymethoxylated citrus
flavonoid, exhibits antiproliferative, anti-invasive, antimetastatic,
and antioxidant activities (20, 31). The molecular mechanisms
and potential applications of tangeretin and other citrus flavonoids
in therapy have been reviewed (20, 31, 32). In this study, we tested
the potential of tangeretin to sensitize cisplatin-resistant human
ovarian cancer A2780/CP70 and 2008/C13 cells to cisplatininduced cell death using different combination schedules and identified the underlying mechanism of its action. The results showed
that tangeretin pretreatment synergizes the low-dose cisplatininduced cancer cell death. The synergistic effect is mediated
through the downregulation of PI3K/Akt pathway. Based on these
observations, tangeretin-cisplatin combination may offer a promising new approach in effective treatment of human ovarian cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. Human ovarian cancer cells A2780 and its
cognate cisplatin-resistant A2780/CP70 were provided by Dr. Paul Modrich
(Duke University, Durham, NC). Another pair of cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cell lines 2008 and 2008/C13 was
provided by Drs. Francois Claret and Qingxiu Zhang (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.

and SignalSilence Akt small interfering RNA (siRNA) kit were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against β-actin and lamin-B
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against
CyclinB1 and Cdc25c were purchased from Abcam, Inc. Antibody against
p53 was purchased from Neomarkers. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–
conjugated secondary antibodies, protease inhibitor, and the Cell Death
ELISA Plus kit were from Roche. Chemiluminescence substrate was
obtained from Pierce. The DC Bio-Rad protein quantitation reagents were
from Bio-Rad. Plasmid 14751, harboring a constitutively active mutant Akt
gene, was purchased from Addgene.
Cell growth and MTT cytotoxicity assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well
plates, treated with different concentration of cisplatin or tangeretin, and
maintained in culture for 72 h. For the combination experiments, A2780/
CP70 and 2008/C13 cells were treated with tangeretin (150 μmol/L) either
24 h before or after cisplatin (3 or 6 μmol/L) treatment. Drug-treated cells
were incubated for 72 h and then MTT was added to the cultures for an
additional 2 h. The medium was replaced with acidified isopropanol for
1 h and the absorbance was determined by Spectramax M5 microplate
reader (Molecular Devices). Drug interactions and isobologram were analyzed using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft).
DNA fragmentation analysis for detecting apoptosis. Cells were treated with 150 μmol/L tangeretin or vehicle for 24 h and then exposed to 3 or
6 μmol/L cisplatin or vehicle for another 72 h. Adherent and floating cells
were recovered and DNA was isolated and evaluated for fragmentation as
described earlier (33).
Quantitative measurement of apoptosis by Histone/DNA ELISA. Cell
death ELISA plus kit was used for detection of apoptosis according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were treated with tangeretin and cisplatin
as described above. The cytoplasmic histone/DNA fragments in cell lysates were

lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Samples were subjected to SDSPAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies at
4°C overnight, washed with TBST buffer, and incubated again with an
appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at 37°C for 1 h. The membranes were washed and examined by chemiluminescence detection.
Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis. Tangeretin and/
or cisplatin-treated cells were collected and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol
overnight at −20°C. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in a mix of propidium iodide and RNase A, and incubated at 37°C for 40 min. Cells were
pelleted, washed, and resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 1 ×
106/mL and analyzed using BD FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences).
Transfection of constitutively active Akt plasmid. Cells were seeded
in an antibiotic-free medium at 37°C for 24 h and transfected with constitutively active Akt plasmid 14751 or empty vector DNA using
Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's
instructions. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated as described
above and analyzed for cellular proteins and apoptosis.
Akt siRNA transfection. The Akt siRNA kit was used to silence Akt expression according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were grown
for 24 h to ∼50% confluency and medium was replaced with 500 μL of an
antibiotic-free medium. siRNA-transfection reagent mixture was applied to
cultured cells for 48 h. Cells were then treated as described above and analyzed for cellular proteins and apoptosis.

tive effect of cisplatin and tangeretin was examined in cisplatinresistant A2780/CP70 and 2008/C13 human ovarian cancer cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S2). Next, we tested whether tangeretin
can sensitize cells to low-dose cisplatin-induced death. Cells were
exposed to varying concentrations of tangeretin (25–150 μmol/L)
and cisplatin (1.5–6 μmol/L) under two different drug administration scenarios: an initial 24-hour tangeretin exposure followed by
72-hours cisplatin treatment and vice versa. The cell growth was
determined and the values of combination index (CI), a quantitative measure of drug interaction, were calculated (Supplementary
Table S1; Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, pretreatment of cells with tangeretin for 24 hours synergized the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin. The
CI ranged from approximately 0.5 to 0.7 for every tangeretincisplatin combination tested. On the other hand, when cisplatin
was administered before tangeretin, CI was between 1 and 1.1, indicating additive rather than synergistic effects. We selected two
cisplatin doses (3 and 6 μmol/L) that kill about 20% to 30% of resistant cells and combined them with 150 μmol/L tangeretin to
further test whether this combination can enhance the growth inhibition of cisplatin-resistant cells. Figure 1C shows that pretreatment of cells with tangeretin increased the potency of cisplatin
over 2-fold. For instance, single treatment of cells with 3 and 6
μmol/L cisplatin caused approximately 19% and 31.4% growth inhibition in A2780, respectively. However, the growth inhibition increased to 60% and 72.9% when the cells were pretreated with
tangeretin. For the drug administration sequences, using cisplatin

Tangeretin-Mediated Cisplatin Sensitization

before tangeretin, the growth inhibition was only 42.1% and 57.9%
for 3 and 6 μmol/L cisplatin, respectively. A similar response was
seen with 2008/C13 cells. Treatment of 2008/C13 cells with 3 and 6
μmol/L cisplatin caused about 21% and 33% inhibition of cell survival. The inhibition was increased further from 41% and 49% to
58% and 66%, respectively, upon tangeretin pretreatment compared with when tangeretin was added 24 hours after cisplatin administration. These effects were confirmed by colony forming
assay (Supplementary Fig. S2). Taken together, the results indicated that the combination of tangeretin with low dose of cisplatin
elicits significantly higher cytotoxic response in cisplatin-resistant
human ovarian cancer cells.
Tangeretin enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis via a
caspase-dependent mechanism. Cellular apoptosis was assessed
first by gel electrophoretic analysis of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation as well as by a quantitative ELISA assay measuring cytoplasmic histone/DNA fragments. Treatment of A2780/CP70 and
2008/C13 cells with single exposures of tangeretin or cisplatin
showed the presence of mostly high molecular weight DNA as seen
with untreated control. However, a DNA ladder pattern, the typical
feature of apoptosis, was distinctly observed upon combination of
tangeretin with different concentrations of cisplatin. This apoptotic response was reversed upon pretreatment with the general caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 2A, lanes 5, 6, 13, and 14 versus
lanes 7, 8, 15, and 16). The quantitative measurement of apoptosis
showed that tangeretin alone caused negligible increase in cell
death over the background. Also, treatment with cisplatin up to
6 μmol/L revealed a minimal extent of cell death. On the other

hand, tangeretin before cisplatin treatment caused a robust increase in apoptosis index of treated cells (Fig. 2B, columns 5, 6,
13, and 14) that was reversed upon caspase inhibition (Fig. 2B, columns 7, 8, 15, and 16). Moreover, the cleavage of PARP, a hallmark
of caspase-dependent apoptosis, and activation of the caspase-7
and caspase-3 were also seen in parallel for the same combination
treatments. Consistent with cell growth inhibition, the cleavage of
caspase-7, caspase-3, and PARP were abolished by z-VAD-FMK, indicating that the apoptosis was specifically mediated through activation of the caspase pathway. Notably, the overall apoptotic
response was significantly higher in combined tangeretin and
3 μmol/L cisplatin dually exposed than in 6 μmol/L cisplatin singly
treated cells. Thus, these results also suggested a synergized
apoptotic effect of tangeretin-cisplatin combination on cisplatinresistant A2780/CP70 and 2008/C13 cells.
Tangeretin-cisplatin combination arrests resistant cells in
G2-M phase. Asynchronously growing A2780/CP70 cells, treated
with 150 μmol/L tangeretin followed by 3 μmol/L cisplatin, were
examined for their cycle progression by flow cytometry (Fig. 3A
and B). In untreated control, the percentage of cells in G1, S, and
G2-M phases were 63.47%, 21.22%, and 10.51%, respectively. Single
exposure with cisplatin had no significant effect on the cell cycle,
whereas tangeretin caused a small redistribution to G2-M-phase.
The tangeretin-cisplatin treatment, however, resulted in a pronounced G2-M arrest. The percentage of G1-, S-, and G2-M–phase
cells following tangeretin-cisplatin treatment was 15.95%, 14.82%,
and 51.98%, respectively. Thus, the accumulation of G2-M-phase
cells was largely at the expense of cells failing to cycle into G1

Figure 4. Tangeretin-cisplatin combination downregulates p-Akt and its
downstream substrates. The A2780/CP70 and 2008/C13 cells were treated with
either 150 μmol/L tangeretin or its vehicle for 24 h and then treated for another
72 h with cisplatin or its vehicle. The cellular proteins p-Akt, Akt, p-Bad, Bad,
NFκB, p-GSK-3β, and GSK-3β were determined by Western blot analysis.

phase. As expected, flow cytometry revealed the presence of a high
proportion of sub–G1-phase population (apoptotic cell) in cultures
treated with tangeretin-cisplatin combination. Consistent with the
flow cytometric analysis, tangeretin-cisplatin treatment reduced
the levels of Cdc25C and cyclin B1, whereas the p53 level was constitutively elevated in these cells (Fig. 3C).
p-Akt and its substrates are downregulated by tangeretincisplatin combination. Because cisplatin resistance of human
ovarian cancer is related to activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (4), we wanted to determine the potential attenuation of this
pathway by tangeretin-cisplatin treatment. Western blot analysis
(Fig. 4) showed a specific reduction in the p-Akt protein in
A2780/CP70 and 2008/C13 cells treated with tangeretin-cisplatin,
compared with that of untreated as well as singly treated controls.
The total Akt level, however, remained unaffected by all treatment

conditions. Relatively insignificant decrease of p-Akt by tangeretin
was consistent with the high IC50 observed for this treatment. The
expression levels of Akt downstream substrates NF-κB, BAD, and
GSK-3β were also assessed. The level of NF-κB p65 showed the expected decrease by tangeretin-cisplatin combination. The combination treatment also decreased p-BAD and p-GSK-3β without
affecting their nonphosphorylated forms. Taken together, these data suggested that regulation of Akt pathway is intimately associated with tangeretin-cisplatin–induced growth inhibition, apoptosis
and G2-M arrest.
Tangeretin-cisplatin combination induces apoptosis in resistant cells by downregulating Akt signaling. To understand
whether modulation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in
tangeretin-cisplatin–induced apoptosis in resistant cells, we performed a series of experiments based on PI3K inhibition, siRNAmediated Akt silencing, and ectopic Akt overexpression in
A2780/CP70 cells. We pretreated the cells with PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 before drug administration. The results showed that
PI3K inhibition induced a dose-dependent PARP cleavage and
DNA fragmentation in tangeretin-treated cells (Fig. 5A, lanes and
columns 7 and 8), indicating that PI3K acts as an upstream factor
in tangeretin-induced cellular proapoptotic signaling. Moreover,
pretreatment of the cells with PI3K inhibitor alongside tangeretincisplatin combination treatment caused a dramatic increase
of PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5A, lanes and
columns 10 versus lanes and columns 2, 5, 7, and 9). These data
clearly identified PI3K as the upstream regulatory factor for invoking the tangeretin's effect in augmenting the cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity and apoptosis.
Next, we investigated the functional relevance of Akt to sensitization of A2780/CP70 cells by tangeretin-cisplatin treatment.
A2780/CP70 cells were transfected with Akt siRNA before drug
treatment and quantitative Akt knockdown was confirmed by
Western blot analysis. Akt knockdown induced a dose-dependent

Tangeretin-Mediated Cisplatin Sensitization

GSK-3β is PI3K/Akt downstream effector of tangeretincisplatin–induced apoptosis. Because PI3K/Akt influences
apoptosis through multiple auxiliary pathways, we wanted to assess the extent of contribution of GSK-3β in tangeretin-cisplatin–
induced apoptosis. A2780/CP70 cells were pretreated with a specific GSK-3β inhibitor, SB216763, before the tangeretin-cisplatin
treatment for measuring the effects on apoptosis parameters.
The inhibition of GSK-3β resulted in complete blockage of tangeretin-cisplatin–induced PARP cleavage and apoptosis (Fig. 6A and B,
lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, quantitative measurement of DNA fragmentation showed that GSK-3β inhibitor
blocked ∼60% of apoptosis resulting from the combination treatment. These data indicated that GSK-3β is another major target
of acquired cisplatin resistance through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
and its downregulation, through inactivating PI3K/Akt signaling,
contributes significantly to tangeretin-cisplatin–induced apoptosis.

Discussion

PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation in tangeretin-treated cells
(Fig. 5B, lanes and columns 7 and 8), indicating that Akt is also
an upstream factor of tangeretin-induced cellular proapoptotic
signaling. Akt silencing resulted in partial PARP cleavage by
3 μmol/L cisplatin treatment, which was prominently elevated
upon tangeretin-cisplatin combination treatment (Fig. 5B, lanes
and columns 9 and 10 versus lanes and columns 4 and 5). The
results of PARP cleavage were corroborated by parallel measurements of apoptosis. These results firmly emphasize the central
role of Akt in regulation of apoptotic response in resistant
A2780/CP70 cells to tangeretin-cisplatin treatment.
Finally, we transfected Akt expression construct into A2780/
CP70 cells to test if ectopically overexpressed, constitutively active
form of Akt can block tangeretin-cisplatin–induced apoptosis.
Western blotting confirmed that Akt was significantly overexpressed in A2780/CP70 cells compared with vector DNA transfected controls (Fig. 5C). Here, the combination treatment of the
controls exhibited the signature PARP cleavage and apoptosis responses. However, in cells overexpressing Akt, both PARP cleavage
and DNA fragmentation were dramatically blocked in tangeretincisplatin treated cells (Fig. 5C, lanes 5 and 6). These results showed
that Akt expression overrode the effect of tangeretin treatment and
prevented the drug-treated cells from undergoing apoptosis. The
results further suggested that the p-Akt and its downstream substrates were vital signaling pathway components responsive for
tangeretin-cisplatin treatment. We surmised that PI3K/Akt signaling is a key mediator of cisplatin resistance of A2780/CP70 cells.
Downregulation of PI3K/Akt pathway by tangeretin-cisplatin treatment eliminates the downstream apoptosis inhibitory signals, e.g.,
NF-κB and activated BAD, and consequently renders the resistant
A2780/CP70 cells susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin.

Although cisplatin has been widely used for decades to treat a
wide range of cancers, de novo and acquired resistance, restricting
the successful use of this potent chemotherapeutic agent continues to pose a major clinical challenge. The dose escalation necessary to overcome even a small increase in cellular resistance can
cause severe cytotoxicity to dose-limiting normal tissue. Thus,
strategies using dual agents that act through distinct molecular
mechanisms, rather than using single agents, represent the most
useful alternatives for achieving higher curability with least toxicity
during cancer chemotherapy. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in evaluating synergistic cancer cell cytotoxicity from
combining chemotherapeutic agents with highly promising and
relatively innocuous dietary flavonoids (34, 35). In this study, we
investigated the potential of a dietary flavonoid, tangeretin, to
sensitize the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells to cisplatininduced cytotoxicity. We have showed that tangeretin reduces
the recalcitrance of human ovarian cancer cells to low-dose
cisplatin-induced cell death through downregulation of PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway.
A recent report has identified tangeretin as belonging to a superior cancer-preventive flavonoid subclass that exhibits antiproliferative activity against several human cancer cell lines (20). Its
antiproliferative effects have been attributed to alteration of activities related to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. However, the underlying molecular events mediating growth inhibition, especially the
basis of synergized antiproliferative effects on cancer cells, are not
completely understood. Tangeretin has been reported to induce G1
cell cycle arrest in human breast and colon cancer cells (36). In
human colorectal carcinoma cells, tangeretin increases the cellular
expression of p21 and p27 (37). We, however, observed an accumulation of G2-M cell population in tangeretin–singly treated as well
as the tangeretin-cisplatin–treated A2780/CP70 cisplatin-resistant
human ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 3). Similar to our data, tangeretin
has been reported to induce G2-M arrest in p53-null HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (38). As G2-M arrest is typically linked
to DNA damage response, we posit that pretreatment with tangeretin sensitizes these cells to respond to DNA damage especially in
the context of their p53 function. The A2780/CP70 cell line initially
developed their resistance to cisplatin from repeated exposures of
the parental A2780 cells to challenge doses of cisplatin. Despite severe and cumulative genotoxic exposures, A2780/CP70 cells retain
their wild-type p53 gene sequence. Nevertheless, these exposures

render p53 protein transcriptionally inactive in A2780/CP70 cells.
For instance, DNA damage fails to induce the accumulation of p21
protein in cisplatin-resistant parental cells, and this induction is
normal in cisplatin-sensitive parental cells (39).1 More importantly,
A2780/CP70 cisplatin-resistant cells constitutively express p53 protein in both wild-type as well as mutant conformation as detected
by conformation-specific pAb240 antibody (39). The A2780 cells, on
the other hand, express functional p53 protein recognizable by
pAb1620 antibody. Moreover, transfection of V143A mutant p53 into A2780 cells increase resistance of the cells to DNA-damaging
agents but not to paclitaxel (40). It is possible that the inherently
altered conformation of p53 associated with the abrogated p53
function occurred in A2780/CP70 cells, contributing to their cisplatin resistance (39). The changes in p53 functional status in
A2780/CP70 cisplatin-resistant cells could also make them amenable to the observed G2-M arrest in response to tangeretin-cisplatin
treatment.
Increased apoptosis induced by cisplatin is another feature of
cellular response to combined tangeretin and cisplatin treatment,
which manifests as the synergetic growth inhibitory effect on
cisplatin-resistant cells. Here, we have shown that specific PI3K inhibition by LY294002 induced a tangeretin dose–dependent PARP
cleavage and DNA fragmentation in the tangeretin-treated cells.
Furthermore, pretreatment of the cells with PI3K inhibitor caused
a dramatic increase of PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation in
tangeretin-cisplatin–treated A2780/CP70 cells. In parallel, knockdown of Akt had a similar effect on tangeretin-cisplatin–induced
apoptosis. In contrast, the overexpression of constitutively active Akt
expression overrides the proapoptotic effect of tangeretin-cisplatin
treatment and prevented drug-treated cells from apoptosis. These
results showed that PI3K/Akt signaling pathway mechanistically
regulates the tangeretin-cisplatin–induced apoptosis. Besides, clear
downregulation of p-Akt and its downstream substrates NF-κB,
p-GSK-3β, and p-BAD were only observed in tangeretin-cisplatin–
treated cells. Tangeretin treatment alone did not appreciably alter
the cellular levels of these cell survival regulators. Given that tangeretin potentiates growth inhibition of cells caused by cisplatin in a
drug administration sequence–dependent manner, we reason that
tangeretin pretreatment could condition the cells to respond to
cisplatin-induced DNA damage by muffling the constitutive activation of p-Akt. The A2780/CP70 and 2008/C13 cells express high
levels of p-Akt (Fig. 4), indicating that the cells have a constitutively activated cell survival signaling. Such a scenario of activated signaling in cells would inevitably institute an enhanced
survival and impose a barrier for desired killing effects of DNAdamaging therapeutic agents. Consistent with this notion, the
A2780/CP70 cells are not only resistant to cisplatin, but also
cross-resistant to irradiation, melphalan, and Adriamycin (41).
Therefore, implementing tangeretin pretreatment would condition
A2780/CP70 and 2008/C13 cells, via downregulated Akt-mediated

cell survival signaling, to become increasingly susceptible to cisplatin as well as other therapeutic agents. It should be noted that
tangeretin suppresses IL-1β–induced Akt activation in human
lung carcinoma cells (42). Thus, it is envisaged that the downregulation of p-Akt and its downstream substrates, NF-κB, p-GSK-3β,
and p-BAD, by combined treatment reflects the synergy between
tangeretin and cisplatin in modulation of Akt phosphorylation
(activation).
Among many downstream factors of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, we have only examined the contribution of GSK-3β inhibition
to tangeretin-cisplatin–induced apoptosis. However, GSK-3β is not
the only PI3K/Akt downstream culprit factor involved in regulating
cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In fact, GSK-3β inhibitor blocked only
∼60% of tangeretin-cisplatin–induced apoptosis. Other downstream factors of PI3K/Akt pathway could also participate and
account for the rest of the observed apoptotic effect. We also
observed downregulation of NF-κB, p-GSK-3β, and p-BAD by
tangeretin-cisplatin treatment. At present, it is difficult to attribute
the extent of individual contribution of these regulatory factors to
tangeretin-cisplatin–induced apoptosis. However, it is certain that
modulation of Akt activation by the combined treatment represents a major intracellular switch to mechanistically control the
tangeretin-cisplatin–induced tumor cells apoptosis.
In summary, our data experimentally showed that tangeretin
pre-exposure can overcome resistance of human ovarian cancer
cells to growth inhibition by cisplatin. From a mechanistic standpoint, tangeretin-cisplatin combination downregulates PI3K/Akt
pathway, leading to the sensitization of cancer cells to cisplatininduced cell death through apoptosis. The data provide a firm
molecular basis for the pharmacologic effect underlying the use
of tangeretin as a valuable therapeutic adjuvant. Given the
broad-spectrum organ safety of tangeretin, already shown in laboratory animals in vivo (43, 44), the present work should expedite
the exploration and use of tangeretin in enhancing the efficacy
of cisplatin in experimental animal studies as well as clinical trials,
with the caveat of successfully attaining effective tangeretin doses
through human consumption of citrus fruits. It would also be appealing to determine whether tangeretin interacts with additional
physical and chemical therapeutic agents in killing a variety of other
drug-resistant cancer cells.
