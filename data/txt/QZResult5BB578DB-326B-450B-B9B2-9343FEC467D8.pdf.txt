Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes are both commonly altered during carcinogenesis. For
oncogenes and other genes that drive growth, targeting mutated or activated forms (such as the
EGFR-Her2/Nneu pathway) has been shown to be an effective anti-cancer approach.
Pharmacologically targeting tumor suppressor genes has not been as fruitful, as many tumor
suppressor genes are irreversibly silenced through somatic mutation or entirely deleted during
carcinogenesis, thereby making it difficult to restore gene function. BRM, a key SWI/SNF
complex subunit and a putative tumor suppressor gene, is inactivated in 15–20% of many solid
tumor types. Unlike other tumor suppressor genes, the loss of BRM has been shown to be a
reversible epigenetic change, rather than an irreversible genetic alteration. Using a high
throughput drug screen, we identified a number of compounds that could effectively restore BRM
expression and function. Two of these compounds, RH (RH02032) and GK (GK0037), were
found to be such reactivating agents. Both compounds led to robust re-expression of BRM,
induced downstream expression of BRM-dependent genes and inhibited BRM-dependent growth
across a wide range of BRM-deficient cancer cell lines of different origins. We therefore show, for
the first time, that pharmacologic reversal of epigenetic changes of the SWI/SNF chromatic
remodeling complex subunit, BRM, is a potentially viable and novel therapeutic approach.

Introduction
Targeted cancer therapy is focused on blocking or interfering with key molecular alterations
that give cancer cells a growth advantage and allow them to escape the normal control
mechanisms. Both small-molecule inhibitors and antibodies have been devised to block the
function of cell-surface receptors, such as HER2 and EGFR2, and inhibiting certain
intracellular kinases, such as Bcr-Abl, have also been successful as targeted therapies (for

example, imatinib). In general, these new cancer drugs have focused on blocking oncogenic
molecular changes. Yet, cancer evolves not only because of unfettered growth mechanisms,
but also because of the loss of proteins involved in growth-inhibition—that is, tumor
suppressors. When oncogenes are amplified, altered or mutated, the resultant genes usually
have acquired constitutive or enhanced growth-promoting properties that can serve as
targets. In contrast, tumor suppressors are not simply mutated, but are deleted in the majority
of cases, rendering them exceedingly difficult to target. However, in a subset of cases,
certain tumor suppressor proteins are not mutated, but rather silenced, raising the possibility
that their expression can be restored. Such suppression is often called epigenetic because the
mechanism of silencing requires ancillary or additional proteins. In theory, although it may
be feasible to restore epigenetically suppressed proteins, the practical application of such
approaches has lagged far behind those that target oncogenic proteins.

Our pursuit to study the SWI/SNF complex involvement in cancer stemmed from the initial
observation that the INI1(BAF47) proteins were likely bona fide tumor suppressors. In vivo
murine knockout studies of this protein show that homogenous loss of BAF47 is highly
tumorigenic—indeed, 100% of mice develop tumors within a median time of 10 weeks
(Roberts et al., 2002). BAF47 is only one subunit of the SWI/SNF complex (Wang et al.,
1996a, b), and in yeast the complex requires the bulk of subunits to be present (Carlson and
Laurent, 1994); thus, we and others reasoned that other SWI/SNF units could be involved in
cancer development. We found via western blot analysis in a variety of cancer cell lines that
the SWI/SNF ATPase homologues Brahma (BRM) and Brahma-Related Gene 1 (BRG1)
were missing in at least 10% of cancer cell lines and up to 30–40% of lung cancer cell lines
(DeCristofaro et al., 2001; Reisman et al., 2003). Immunohistochemical staining of primary
lung cancers showed that BRG1 is lost in 15% of lung cancers, whereas BRM is lost slightly
more often, about 17–18% (Glaros et al., 2007) (unpublished data). Moreover, BRM has
been found to be silenced in 10–20% of lung, breast, colon, esophageal, ovarian, bladder,
prostate, gastric and head/neck tumors (Glaros et al., 2007; Yamamichi et al., 2007; Shen et
al., 2008; Reisman et al., 2009), suggesting that this protein has a general role in cancer. Reexpression experiments showed that, like BAF47, restoring either BRG1 or BRM in
deficient cell lines inhibits growth (Betz et al., 2002; Sansam and Roberts 2006). Moreover,
BRG1 and BRM are known to bind to Rb and its family members, and BRG1 or BRM is
specifically required for Rb-mediated growth inhibition (Dunaief et al., 1994; Strober et al.,
1996; Reisman et al., 2002, 2009). Subsequent studies have linked SWI/SNF to anticancer
cellular functions, such as DNA repair, cellular adhesion, differentiation and development
(Peterson and Workman, 2000; Klochendler-Yeivin et al., 2002; Morrison and Shen, 2006;
Simone, 2006; Reisman et al., 2009). Hence, the inactivation of SWI/SNF through the loss
of one of its key ATPases, BRG1 or BRM, would likely spur the development of cancer.
These studies together, therefore, indicate that BRM and BRG1 are likely tumor
suppressors.
Mutations are likely the prominent reason for loss of BRG1 expression, similar to many
other tumor suppressors (Wong et al., 2000; Medina et al., 2008). In contrast, mutations are
not associated with loss of BRM protein expression, and BRM is epigenetically silenced
(Mizutani et al., 2002; Yamamichi et al., 2005; Glaros et al., 2007). Recently, several groups
have shown that the suppression of BRM in cancer cell lines can be restored with histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (Bourachot et al., 2003; Yamamichi et al., 2005; Glaros et
al., 2007). However, Bourachot et al. (2003) clearly demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors,
when applied to cancer cells, induce the acetylated form of BRM, thereby inactivating the
function of BRM. Thus, HDAC inhibitors can induce BRM and thereby demonstrate that
BRM can be restored, but because they inhibit BRM function, they cannot be practically
used to restore BRM in a clinical setting. As reactivation of BRM can inhibit growth and
thus could be clinically advantageous, a major goal of our work has been to find novel

small-molecule compounds that can restore both the expression and the function of BRM.
This would represent that, potentially for the first time, a tumor suppressor pathway, rather
than an oncogene, could be used as a targeted therapy. Here, we show the results of a high
throughput drug screen identifying a number of compounds that not only restore BRM
expression but its function as well. Moreover, we highlight the advantages of restoring
BRM, as we found that ectopic as well as pharmacological restoration of BRM induced
growth inhibition. Together, these findings demonstrate the initial step to showing to the
feasibility of restoring an epigenetically suppressed protein, BRM. Like targeted therapy for
oncogenes such as EGFR or HER2, restoration of epigenetically lost pathways could add to
our arsenal of cancer fighting.

Results and discussion
Reversal of BRM silencing by infection of BRM-containing vectors resulted in growth

The first step toward assessing whether activating BRM could be used as a form of therapy
is to show that there are compounds that can restore not only BRM expression, but also
BRM function. Hence, an initial goal of our research was to identify agents that can
reactivate BRM for therapeutic purposes. For these studies, we took advantage of the fact
that the glucocorticoid receptor is SWI/SNF dependent. We stably integrated the MMTV
(glucocorticoid-sensitive) promoter linked to the luciferase gene into the BRG1/BRMdeficient cell line, SW13. With the addition of the glucocorticoid agonist, dexamethasone,
this reporter cell line yields high levels of luciferase only if and when the BRM gene is
induced by a given compound. Hence, we used this reporter construct to screen and identify
compounds that could pharmacologically restore a functional BRM protein. Further details
of this high throughput screening are described elsewhere (Gramling and Reisman, 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For this purpose, we developed a high throughput ‘BRM-functional’ cell-based assay to
screen for BRM-reactivating agents from a number of drug libraries, including the
ChemDiv, MayBridge and ChemBridge chemical libraries at the Life Science Institute at the
University of Michigan and Michigan High Throughput Center (Kalamazoo, MI) (Gramling
and Reisman, 2011). Approximately, 1% of the agents were screen-positive and further
testing of a subset of these hits showed that two compounds (RH02032 [RH] and GK00397
[GK]) readily induced BRM, with relatively low toxicity (see Supplementary Figure 1 for
the structures). As HDAC inhibitors maximally induce BRM protein and mRNA by 72 h
(Glaros et al., 2007), we used a 72-h time point to conduct dose-response curves to
determine the lowest concentration, providing the maximal induction of BRM mRNA (data
not shown). At the optimal concentrations of these compounds (50 μM of RH and 200 μM
of GK), we saw little-to-no toxicity over 72 h. In contrast, the induction of BRM proteins
lagged behind the induction of BRM mRNA and required between 5–6 days to be
maximally induced. During this timeframe, these concentrations of RH and GK did cause
some toxicity (cell death), but this was minimized (~15–20%) if we used higher cell density
and if the media (with compounds) was changed after 72 h. Application of these two
compounds (50 μM of RH and 200 μM of GK) produced 10–12-fold induction of BRM
mRNA over 72 h (as measured by quantitative PCR; Figure 1a) and robust induction of
BRM protein levels (via western blotting; Figure 1b) after 5–6 days. The induction of both
BRM mRNA and protein was essentially completely blocked by the introduction of antiBRM short hairpin RNA interference (shRNAi) into these cell lines (Figures 1a and b). The
efficiency of anti-BRM shRNAi can be seen in the knockdown of BRM (90–95%) of the
BRM-positive cell line H460 (Supplementary Figure 1).
To show that the induced endogenous BRM is functional (and not inactive, as is the case of
some HDAC inhibitors (Glaros et al., 2007)), we examined the C33A and SW13 BRMOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 July 23.

negative cell lines treated with RH or GK for the induction of a number of BRM-dependent
genes (DDX58, P8, XAF1 and LGAL). The BRM dependency of these genes was
previously shown through microarray experiments on C33A and SW13 at 72 h after
transfection with BRM (unpublished data). After 72 h of RH or GK exposure in
BRM:BRG1-deficient cell lines (SW13 and C33A), DDX58, P8, XAF1 and/or LGAL genes
were all induced a minimum of two ΔCT values (Figures 2a–d), or at least four- to five-fold.
To demonstrate that this induction was due to BRM and not some other effect of these
compounds, we stably infected both cell lines with anti-BRM shRNAi. We then repeated
this experiment using SW13 and C33A infected with anti-BRM shRNAi and observed
minimal induction of these genes, <1 ΔCT value or less than two-fold (Figures 2a–d),
thereby demonstrating that the induction of these genes is BRM dependent. In turn, the
induction of these genes shows that BRM is functional when induced by these compounds
and that pharmacological restoration of BRM can occur. This is a novel advance, as no other
agents to date have been able to restore BRM functionality. This discovery opens the door
for possibly developing BRM as a form of targeted therapy.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Previously published data have shown that introducing BRM or BRG1 into BRG1:BRMdeficient cell lines (SW13) arrests growth (Dunaief et al., 1994; Strober et al., 1996;
Muchardt et al., 1998). However, these data are derived from only a few (~2) cell lines. To
determine if the same is true in other BRM-deficient cells, we introduced BRM by viral
infection into nine BRM-deficient cell lines and two (control) BRM-positive cell lines using
pBABE-BRM. As a control, we also infected these cells with the empty vector version of
pBABE. In each case, significant growth inhibition occurred when pBABE-BRM was reintroduced into the BRM-deficient parental line, with the vast majority of the cell lines
having growth inhibition between 85–95% (Figure 3a; reference: pBABE (empty vector)
infected daughter lines). In contrast, when pBABE-BRM was introduced in the BRMpositive cells (H460 and Calu-6), only ~20% growth inhibition was observed. In the control
experiments, essentially no growth inhibition was observed when only pBABE (empty
vector) was introduced into either BRM-negative or BRM-positive cells. These data and
previously published data (Dunaief et al., 1994; Muchardt et al., 1998) show that restoration
of BRM expression can lead to growth inhibition in BRM-deficient cancer cell lines.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to restoring BRM expression, we tested whether RH and GK could inhibit
growth akin to the viral introduction of exogenous BRM. We evaluated the growth of BRMdeficient cells (C33A and SW13) upon exposure to RH and GK, and found that, indeed, RH/
GK caused these cell lines to undergo growth arrest and flatten, akin to the experimental
induction of the BRM gene (Figure 3b). Both cell lines may have also increased cellular
adhesion, as the cells were much harder to remove from their plastic dishes after
pharmacological intervention; this observation is not surprising since restoration of BRM
can induce CD44, E-cadherin, CEACAM1 and a number of integrin adhesion molecules
(unpublished data). When BRG1 is ectopically expressed, a similar inhibitory effect on
growth is seen and similar cadres of adhesion proteins are induced (Dunaief et al., 1994;
Strober et al., 1996; Liu et al., 2001; Hendricks et al., 2004). To test whether the observed
growth arrest was due to BRM re-expression, we blocked expression by infecting these
parental BRMdeficient cell lines with anti-BRM shRNAi (Figure 3). When BRM expression
was inhibited by shRNAi, neither RH nor GK effectively inhibited growth when applied for
5 days. These data suggest that RH and GK inhibit cellular growth in BRM-deficient cell
lines by inducing BRM expression; if BRM is abrogated, the growth inhibition seen with the
application of RH, GK, or both, is also abrogated. Hence, pharmacological restoration of
BRM seems to be a viable therapeutic avenue worth further experimental exploration.
As RH and GK become increasingly more toxic with prolonged exposures, these
compounds, although valuable experimental tools, are probably not feasible drug candidates.

Further work will be required to determine how and why BRM is suppressed, and part of
this puzzle are two BRM polymorphisms, which have high morphology to MEF2-binding
sites and correlate very tightly with BRM loss in cell lines and primary lung tumors. It is
likely that these polymorphisms are functionally linked to the loss of BRM in cancers.
Moreover, as these polymorphic sites are potentially correlated with lung cancer risk, BRM
loss may be a precursor to cancer development. This observation (in turn) opens the door for
pharmacological BRM restoration as a means to potentially modify cancer risk, in addition
to being a primary form of targeted therapy for established cancers.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In summary, our results begin to lay the groundwork to pursue BRM reactivation as a form
of clinical therapy. Restoring anticancer proteins may be a viable and reasonable therapeutic
approach to complement the inhibition of oncogenic changes. We also showed, using two
example compounds (RH and GK), that BRM can be effectively pharmacologically restored.
In previous work, we have shown that BRM expression is absent (or suppressed) in a fifth of
all tumor types (Reisman et al., 2009), which is a sufficiently large enough fraction
(compared with subsets of lung, colorectal, and breast cancer patients that are defined by
somatic alterations in EGFR, KRAS or HER2neu, respectively) to make such approaches
prudent and economical. Moreover, we have sequenced both tumors and cell lines, and have
not found any mutations (Glaros et al., 2007), thereby providing evidence that epigenetic
silencing is the main method of suppression of BRM in cancer cells. Our data provide a
foundation and basis for further study of BRM as a potential target for therapeutic
intervention across many different tumor types.

RH 50 μM (a, b) or GK 200 μM (c, d) for 72 h. The DDX58, P8 LGAL and/or XAF1 genes
were significantly induced in the C33A (a, c) and SW13 (b, d) cell lines, although these
genes were not significantly induced in the anti-BRM shRNAi-derived C33A and SW13
daughter cell lines. The standard error shown represents six experiments for each bar on the
graph.

(a) The effect of restoring BRM expression on growth. We virally infected BRM-deficient
cell lines, Panc-1, H1299, H522, SW13, A427, H23, H1573, H125 and C33A (white bars)
and BRM-positive cell lines H460 and Calu-6 (black bars) with BRM, using pBABE-BRM
and pBABE-empty vector. After infection, we selected for 48 h with puromycin to eliminate
uninfected cells, and confirmed BRM re-expression in each cell line through quantitative
PCR. We then measured growth inhibition by MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (using a BioTek plate reader, Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA) or
by flow cytometry with trypan blue exclusion after either viral infection or pharmacological
treatment with RH (50 μM) or GK (200 μM). For virally infected cell lines, we measured
the number of cancer cells that were present 5 days after infecting with BRM (pBABE-BRM
infected; Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA), comparing them to the same cancer cells
infected with empty vector (pBABE empty vector; Addgene). To eliminate uninfected cells,
infected cultures were grown in the presence of 7.5 μg/ml of puromycin for 2–5 days after
infection. In each case, BRM reexpression significantly inhibited the growth of BRMdeficient cell lines, whereas positive BRM cell lines were only mildly inhibited. The effect
of RH and GK on growth inhibition. (b) The BRMinducing agents RH and GK also
inhibited growth when applied for 3 days to the BRM-deficient cell lines C33A and SW13,
whereas the anti-BRM shRNAi-infected SW13 and C33A daughter cell lines were not
significantly inhibited with the application of RH and GK.
