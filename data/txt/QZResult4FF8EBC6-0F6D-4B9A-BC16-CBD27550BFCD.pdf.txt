Abstract
Resveratrol, a natural phytoestrogen found in red wine and a
variety of plants, is reported to have protective effects against
lung cancer; however, there is little work directed toward
the understanding of the mechanism of its action in this
disease. In this study, we used a combination of experimental
approaches to understand the biological activity and molecular mechanisms of resveratrol. Microarray gene expression
profiling and high-throughput immunoblotting (PowerBlot)
methodologies were employed to gain insights into the
molecular mechanisms of resveratrol action in human lung
cancer cells. In this report, we confirm the up-regulation of
p53 and p21 and the induction of apoptosis by the activation
of the caspases and the disruption of the mitochondrial
membrane complex. We show the arrest of A549 cells in the
G1 phase of cell cycle in the presence of resveratrol and also
report alterations in both gene and protein expressions of
cyclin A, chk1, CDC27, and Eg5. Furthermore, the results
indicated that resveratrol action is mediated via the transforming growth factor-B pathway, particularly through the
Smad proteins. Results showed the down-regulation of
the Smad activators 2 and 4 and the up-regulation of the
repressor Smad 7 as a result of resveratrol treatment. Resveratrol is a potent inhibitor of A549 lung cancer cell growth,
and our results suggest that resveratrol may be a promising
chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent for lung cancer.

Introduction
Resveratrol (3,5,4¶-trihydroxy-stilbene) is a phytoalexin found in
red wine and a variety of plants, including grapes, peanuts,
mulberries, and legumes (1). Phytoalexins are produced in response
to stress, injury, fungal infection, or UV exposure (1, 2). Resveratrol
is found in both the trans- and the cis-isomeric forms, although
trans-resveratrol is thought to be the biologically active isoform
due to steric stability (3). The biological importance of resveratrol
first emerged when it was found present in red wine and was found
to be used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine (4). Many
studies have been published to date demonstrating the beneficial
effects of resveratrol in cellular systems. Epidemiologic studies
revealed an inverse correlation between red wine consumption and
cardiovascular disease in France (known as the ‘‘French Paradox’’)
(5). Other studies have shown resveratrol to be associated with
lipids and to inhibit lipid oxidation (6, 7). Additionally, resveratrol

has been found to inhibit platelet aggregation (8) and also to have
antioxidant properties (9).
During the past 25 years, studies on identifying cancerchemopreventive agents have received considerable attention.
Numerous natural and synthetic chemopreventive agents have
been established as a result of their efficacy in experimental
carcinogenesis models (10). In the first report of resveratrol as a
possible cancer chemopreventive agent, Jang et al. (11) reported
that resveratrol exerts antitumor properties at all three stages
of skin carcinogenesis, including initiation, promotion, and
progression. Since then, other studies have confirmed this work,
and resveratrol has been shown to have chemopreventive
properties in many cancer types, including mammary, prostate,
colon, and lung carcinogenesis (12–15). Its role in prevention and
therapy of cancers of several target organs has been extensively
reviewed (1, 16–19).
Interestingly, an epidemiologic study has recently reported that
high intake of beer or spirits is correlated with increased relative
risk of lung cancer, whereas consumption of red wine is correlated
with a reduced risk (20). This protective effect is attributed to
resveratrol and flavonoids present in red wine. Resveratrol has
already been established as an antiproliferative agent in A549
human lung cancer cells, and this effect has been correlated with
the suppression of phosphorylation of Rb protein and transcription
factors such as nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) and activator protein-1
(AP-1) (21). Kim et al. also showed that this suppression is
accompanied with the induction of p21WAF1/CIP and an increased
activity of caspase-3, which results in increased apoptosis. In
human epidermoid A431 cells, resveratrol treatment resulted in
growth arrest in G1 (22). Consistent with the results reported for
lung cancer, in these cells, induction of p21/WAF1 was observed.
Despite these promising leads, there is very little work directed
toward understanding the mechanism of action of resveratrol in
lung cancer.
In the present study, we orchestrated a dual/combined
experimental approach to identify novel mechanisms of resveratrol
action in human lung cancer A549 cells. We compiled gene
expression profiles using a cDNA microarray and altered expression of proteins as a result of resveratrol treatment using a highthroughput immunoblotting technique known as PowerBlot.
Analyses of these data provided new insights into the molecular
mechanisms of resveratrol action on lung cancer. To our
knowledge, this is the first report that uses the dual microarray—
PowerBlot approach to match gene and protein alterations to
elucidate mechanisms of action of resveratrol in lung cancer
prevention/therapy.

cells were maintained at 37jC with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere
and routinely passaged twice to thrice per week. Resveratrol was obtained
from the National Cancer Institute. For experimental use, resveratrol was
dissolved in ethanol with concentrations in the media not exceeding 0.1%.
Cell proliferation studies. Cells were seeded (5,000 cells per well) in
24-well plates (Corning Inc.) and treated with ethanol (control) or
resveratrol for the indicated times and dosages. Crystal violet assays were
used to measure cell growth. After treatment, the cells were fixed in 1%
glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Crystal violet solution
(0.1%) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Excess
dye was discarded, and 0.2% Triton X-100 was added to each well.
Absorbance was measured at A590 using a microplate reader.
Cell cycle analysis. For DNA content analysis, A549 cells were treated
with ethanol (control) or with resveratrol (25 Amol/L) for 48 h. The cells
were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol at the end of the treatment. The nuclei
were prepared for DNA analysis as previously described (23). Briefly, the
cells were washed in PBS and suspended in citrate buffer [250 mmol/L
sucrose, 40 mmol/L trisodium citrate, 0.05% DMSO (pH, 7.6)]. The nuclei
were trypsinized with buffer containing 1.5 mmol/L spermine tetrahydrochloride, 0.1% NP40, 3.4 mmol/L trisodium citrate, 0.5 mmol/L trizma, and
0.3 mg/mL trypsin (pH, 7.6). Before propidium iodide (0.416 mg/mL)
staining, proteolysis was stopped with buffer containing trypsin inhibitor
(0.25 mg/mL) and 0.1 mg/mL RNase A. Preparations were then analyzed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.
Terminal nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling assay.
A549 cells were seeded (5,000 cells per chamber) on poly–L-lysine–coated
Lab-Tek II Chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) and treated with
ethanol control or resveratrol (25 Amol/L) for 48 h. Following the treatment,
the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at
room temperature, and permeablized in 100% methanol for 6 min at
20jC. DNA fragmentation was detected immunohistochemically using
the In situ Cell Death Detection-POD kit (Roche) as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
Poly caspase FLICA. Cells were seeded and treated on poly–L-lysine–
coated Lab-Tek II Chamber slides as above. The poly caspase FLICA assay
was done as per manufacturer’s instructions (Immunohistochemistry
Technologies, LLC). Briefly, following treatment, cells were incubated with
the poly caspase FLICA reagent for 1 h at 37jC and 5% CO2 and analyzed
directly under a fluorescence microscope to view the green fluorescence
of caspase-positive cells.
Mito-PT assay. Cells were seeded and treated on poly–L-lysine–coated
Lab-Tek II Chamber slides as above. The Mito-PT assay was done as per
manufacturer’s instructions (Immunohistochemistry Technologies, LLC).
Briefly, following treatment, cells were incubated with the Mito-PT reagent
for 15 min at 37jC and 5% CO2 and analyzed directly under a fluorescence
microscope to view changes in the mitochondrial permeability transition as
indicated by the red fluorescence in the cells.
Western blotting. A549 cells were treated with ethanol (control) or
25 Amol/L resveratrol for 48, 72, and 96 h. Cells were lysed at each time
point with 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA; 1 TBS, 1%
NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.004% sodium azide; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail,
2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell lysates were analyzed using the
Lowry protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE,
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with mouse
monoclonal p53 (1:1,000 dilution; Ab-6, Oncogene), rabbit polyclonal p21
(1:200 dilution; C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit polyclonal p27
(1:200 dilution, C-19 sc-528, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) Membranes were
then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
PowerBlot analysis. For the PowerBlot analysis (high-throughput
Western blot screening), A549 cells were treated with ethanol control or
resveratrol (25 Amol/L) for 48 h. Following treatment, cells were incubated
in lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris (pH, 7.4), 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
1% SDS]. The lysates were passed 10 times through a 25-gauge needle to

sheer the cellular DNA. Samples were frozen at 80jC and analyzed by BD
Biosciences Transduction Laboratories. The lysates were separated on highresolution gradient gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.
Each membrane was divided into 40 lanes by applying a chamber-forming
grid. To each chamber, a mixture of monoclonal antibodies was added
(BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories). After 1 h of incubation at
room temperature, the membranes were rinsed and incubated with
secondary antibodies. Resulting images from the Western blot screening
were acquired with an IR scanner (Li-Cor), and the molecular mass of each
band was assessed using specialized software at BD Biosciences
Transduction Laboratories and recognized by an individual antibody in
the specific antibody cocktail used. Control and resveratrol samples were
run in triplicate. The data received from BD Biosciences Transduction
Laboratories was scrutinized in our laboratory and was found to be
accurate. Biological processes were analyzed with the PANTHER (Protein
Analysis through Evolutionary Relationships) pathway analysis (22). Each
protein was categorized and inputted into PANTHER using its associated
Locus Link gene identification number. Proteins that met the fold change
cutoff of 1.25 and whose associated locus link ID was associated with a
biological process with a known GO identification number were considered
for analysis by PANTHER.
RNA isolation, microarray analysis, and real-time reverse
transcription-PCR. A549 cells were treated with ethanol control or
25 Amol/L resveratrol for 48 h. One replicate of control cells and three
replicates of resveratrol-treated cells were analyzed. At the 48-h time point
1 mL TRIzol was added to each culture flask and incubated, and insoluble
material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4jC.
RNA was isolated and precipitated by mixing with isopropanol (0.8 mL) and
centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4jC. The RNA pellet was washed
with 75% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in Rnase-free water. Cleanup of the
RNA was done using an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen). The control sample
and three treated samples were hybridized to the Human Genome U133
Plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) by the University of Chicago’s Functional
Genomics Facility. In GeneSpring v7.2 (Agilent Technologies), cell files were
preprocessed using the robust multichip average (RMA), genes were
normalized to the mean expression of the control sample, and detection
cells were used to filter for probe sets present of marginal in one-fourth of
the arrays. Fold change values for each experimental sample were exported
to Excel for mean and SD calculations. Canonical pathways were analyzed
through the use of the software package Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).1
Genes from that data set that met the fold change cutoff of 1.2 and were
associated with a canonical pathway in the IPA knowledge base were
considered for the analysis. Biological processes were analyzed with
PANTHER. Genes that met the fold change cutoff of 1.2 and were
associated with a biological process with a known GO identification
number were considered for analysis.
Total RNA extraction and the RT reaction were done as described
previously (24). RNA was further subjected to DNase I (Ambion) digestion
and purification using an RNease Mini Kit (Qiagen) before the RT reaction.
Real-time PCR was done with 2 AL diluted RT product in a MyiQ Real-time
PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) using iQTM SYBR Green PCR Supermix
(Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer’s guidelines. The PCR cycling
conditions used were (15 s at 95jC, 15 s at 60jC, and 20 s at 72jC) for
40 cycles. Fold inductions were calculated using the formula 2 (DDCt), where
DDCt is DCt(treatment) DCt(control), DCt is Ct(target gene) Ct(actin) and Ct is
the cycle at which the threshold is crossed. The gene-specific primer pairs
(and product size) for the genes analyzed are as follows: Smad2 forward

Results
Resveratrol inhibits growth of A549, NCI H460, and NCI H23
cells in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of various
concentrations of resveratrol (1–100 Amol/L) on cell proliferation
were examined on A549, NCI H460, and NCI H23 human lung
cancer cells. Resveratrol mediated growth inhibition of A549
cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), significantly inhibiting
growth at 25 Amol/L after a 48-h incubation (IC50, 50 Amol/L)
as shown by crystal violet assay. A linear growth inhibition was
observed up to 100 Amol/L resveratrol, and thereafter, no
significant difference in growth inhibition was shown. Additionally,
several grapeseed extract–derived compounds (25) did not
significantly inhibit cell proliferation (data not shown). Similar
effects were also evident in NCI H460 and NCI H23 human lung

cancer cell lines, with resveratrol being the only compound to
significantly inhibit cellular growth (Fig. 1A).
Effects of resveratrol on the cell cycle progression. To
determine the phase of the cell cycle at which resveratrol exerts its
growth-inhibitory effect, A549 cells were treated with resveratrol,
stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry.
The effect of resveratrol (25 Amol/L for 48 h) on cell cycle
progression is shown in Fig. 1B. Resveratrol arrested A549 lung
cancer cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle: 70% of A549 cells
were found in the G1 phase after 48 h resveratrol treatment in
comparison to only 50% of control cells observed to be in G1 after
48 h.
Effects of resveratrol on the induction of apoptosis. Three
separate assays were used to investigate the induction of apoptosis
in A549 cells by resveratrol (Fig. 1C). The cells were treated for
48 h with 25 Amol/L resveratrol and analyzed for apoptosis by
the terminal nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling
(TUNEL), Poly Caspases FLICA, and Mito-PT assays. Resveratrol
treatment induced features characteristic of apoptosis as shown
by the TUNEL assay [Fig. 1C(i) and (ii)]. These apoptotic
features include brown-stained fragmented nuclei, irregular-shaped
cells, and irregular cytoplasmic membranes observed in the

resveratrol-treated cells [Fig. 1C(ii)]. The Poly Caspases FLICA
assay was used to determine apoptosis via active caspases
[Fig. 1C(iii) and (iv)]. A green fluorescent signal within the cell
indicates that an active caspase has formed a covalent bond with
the FLICA probe. As can be seen from Fig. 1C(iv), A549 cells treated
with resveratrol fluoresce green, hence illustrating apoptosis by
the activation of the caspase cascade. The Mito-PT assay [Fig. 1C(v)
and (vi)] was used to test for mitochondrial functionality and
non–caspase-mediated apoptosis with the Mito-PT reagent. Nonapoptotic healthy control cells [Fig. 1C(v)] exhibit red aggregates
inside intact mitochondria. Apoptotic resveratrol-treated cells,
however, are observed at varying stages of mitochondrial permeability and are identified as the Mito-PT reagent is dispersed
throughout the cells [Fig. 1C(vi)].
Effects of resveratrol on the expression of p53, p21, and p27
mRNA and protein. We next examined the expression changes of
mRNA and proteins that are known to be involved in the inhibition
of cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis. Changes in p53, p21,
and p27 at both the mRNA and protein levels were studied by realtime reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot
analysis, respectively. Results showed an accumulation of p53 in
resveratrol (25 Amol/L)–treated A549 cells, with a 1.62-fold increase
in p53 mRNA levels over control levels by real-time RT-PCR
(Fig. 2A). This increase in p53 mRNA levels was accompanied by an
increase in p53 protein levels observed in total cell lysates (Fig. 2B).
This could be seen as early as 48 h, and the p53 protein level
remained elevated to 96 h (Fig. 2B). p53 up-regulation within the
cell induces p21 expression, which can lead to a p21-mediated
inhibition of cyclin D/cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) and arrest in
G1. A p21 mRNA up-regulation of 6.81-fold over the control mRNA
was seen in the resveratrol-treated A549 cells (Fig. 2C). p21 protein
levels also increased from 24 to 96 h as can be seen in Fig. 2D.
Although we observed a 1.62-fold up-regulation in p27 at the
mRNA level after resveratrol treatment, this up-regulation was not
seen at the protein level (data not shown).
Protein screening by high-throughput Western blot (PowerBlot). A large-scale Western blot–based screening process was

employed to identify new targets of resveratrol modification from a
group of well-characterized signal transduction proteins. Proteins
in the form of total cell lysates were purified from control and
resveratrol-treated (25 Amol/L, 48 h) A549 cells and analyzed by
PowerBlot analyses. The assay uses 996 individual monoclonal
antibodies, of which 841 cross-react with human proteins. Computerassisted and subsequent manual examination of detected signals
revealed 653 protein bands from the PowerBlot screening. When
control expression of protein was compared with the protein
expression in resveratrol-treated cells, 170 protein bands were
identified to be differentially expressed. Based on the confidence
with which the identity of the proteins could be deduced, the
results were further categorized as follows: Bands that passed a
computer-assisted analysis and also passed a manual (visual)
positive in all nine of nine comparisons were grouped by specific
fold change. One hundred and twenty seven protein bands had a
fold change of 1.25 or higher, whereas 89 protein bands had a fold
change of 1.5 or higher. These 89 proteins that were altered by
resveratrol treatment in A549 cells are listed, along with their
specific fold change, respective function, and gene-related locus
link identification in Table 1.
Gene expression changes. Using the Affymetrix human genome
U133 Plus Array, we screened more than 47,000 transcripts for
alterations in A549 mRNA expression after resveratrol treatment
(GEO accession number GSE9008). A549 mRNA was harvested
after 48 h resveratrol treatment at 25 Amol/L. When compared
with the untreated control group, 5,916 genes were found to have
altered expression levels of 1.2-fold or more in the resveratroltreated group. When the fold change cutoff was raised to 1.5-fold,
946 genes were found to have altered expression levels in the
resveratrol-treated group. One hundred and fifty-seven genes had
fold changes greater than 2-fold.
Using the 1.2-fold change cutoff, the 5,916 genes were imported
into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 4.0. This enabled the identification
of biological mechanisms, pathways, and functions most relevant
to the genes of interest altered by resveratrol treatment in A549
cells. We identified an array of canonical pathways regulated by

Figure 2. Regulation of p53 and p21
mRNA and protein levels in A549 human
lung cancer cells by resveratrol
(25 Amol/L). mRNA levels were analyzed
by real-time PCR at 48 h (A and C).
Protein levels were monitored by Western
blot analyses over a 96-h time period
(B and D).

resveratrol in human lung cancer cells. The G1-S cell cycle
checkpoint pathway was a canonical pathway identified by
Ingenuity to be altered by resveratrol action. This correlated with
our previous findings above. In addition, the G2-M cell cycle
checkpoint pathway, as well as the apoptosis cell death cascade
pathway, was identified to be altered by resveratrol treatment in
A549 cells. The identification of gene alterations in the transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) pathway was identified by the
microarray screen and highlighted by Ingenuity as shown in Fig. 3.
The TGF-h pathway activators, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 were
found to be down-regulated by resveratrol, whereas the TGF-h
pathway repressor Smad7 was found up-regulated at the mRNA
level. Down-regulation of mRNAs for Smad2 and Smad4 and the
up-regulation of mRNA for Smad7 were further ascertained by realtime PCR (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescence results using antibodies
against each of the Smad proteins suggest the up-regulation of
Smad7 protein expression and the down-regulation of nuclear
Smad2 and Smad4 in A549 cells after resveratrol treatment, which
is in accordance with the microarray and RT-PCR results (data not
shown). In addition, canonical pathways of the NF-nB pathway and

the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/c-jun-NH 2-kinase
(MAPK/JNK) signaling pathway were also altered by resveratrol.
Combined analysis of PowerBlot and Microarray results.
The PANTHER classification system is a large database of protein
families that have been subdivided into functionally related
subfamilies. Proteins are classified into families of shared function,
which are then categorized by molecular function and biological
process ontology terms (26).
We analyzed the microarray results with PANTHER using a
1.2-fold change cutoff and categorized the mRNA changes into
biological processes. Similarly, substituting the Locus Link gene ID
for each of the PowerBlot proteins, we introduced the results of
the PowerBlot using the 1.25-fold change cutoff (127 proteins) and
categorized these changes into biological processes. Each biological
process has been determined by PANTHER from ontologies similar
to ‘‘GO Gene Ontologies’’; however, the PANTHER biological
processes are simplified to allow for high-throughput analyses.
Our results show that the top biological processes found in the
gene array complemented those found in the PowerBlot analysis
(Table 2). When considering both microarray and PowerBlot

results, the top biological processes altered by resveratrol in A549
cells were those of nucleic acid metabolism, protein metabolism,
cell cycle, and cell proliferation/differentiation signaling pathways.
The proteins/genes that belong to these PANTHER categorized
biological processes include a long list of macromolecules (data not
shown).
Due to the fact that the top biological processes altered by
resveratrol in A549 cells were similar at both the mRNA and
protein levels, we focused on the specific genes/proteins regulated
in these processes. Specifically, for each individual PowerBlot
protein that was identified to be altered by resveratrol, we
determined whether its corresponding mRNA was also affected
in the same manner as assayed by the microarray. Comparing the
microarray and PowerBlot results using a fold change cutoff of
1.2-fold for both the microarray and PowerBlot, we identified 23
genes/proteins that were regulated in a similar manner (Table 3).
These analyses revealed genes/proteins, including cyclins, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), Eg5, ASS, Chk1, integrins, FAK, and
others that were modulated by resveratrol. Thus, the approach of
combining genes/protein expressions provides a selective and
highly informative list to identify signaling pathways for mechanism(s) of chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agents such
as resveratrol.

Discussion
The functional activities of a protein, such as substrate
phosphorylation and levels of activated protein, are arguably
the best estimate of biological activity in a given cellular system
(27, 28). Besides these, a highly valued and accepted form of
analysis of biological activity is an estimate of the actual levels of
mRNA or protein within a cell. In this study, we have undertaken a
combined experimental approach to understand the biological
activity and molecular mechanisms of resveratrol in A549 lung
cancer cells. Using the high-throughput techniques of both
microarray and PowerBlot, we measured mRNA and protein
expression, respectively. These techniques, when combined,
generated a large body of biological data, which, when evaluated,
provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms of
resveratrol action in human lung cancer.
In this report, we observed that resveratrol induces gene and
protein expression involved in multiple biological processes in
A549 lung cancer cells (Table 2). Many of the gene/protein
expression changes such as the up-regulation of p53 and p21 and
the activation of the caspases identified in the present report have
been reported previously. In addition, we also report new signaling
pathways as identified from the gene array and PowerBlot analyses
in A549 cells.

Cancer Research

The roles of resveratrol both as a chemopreventive as well as a
chemotherapeutic agent have previously been reported (29). These
growth-suppressing properties are confirmed for A549 cells in this
report. The flow cytometry analyses suggested that resveratrol
arrested cells in the G1 phase. Previous studies, on the other hand,
have reported that resveratrol or its related stilbenoids arrested
cells in the S or G2-M phases of the cell cycle (21). The changes in
both gene and protein expression, such as the up-regulation of p53
and p21 and the down-regulation of cyclin A, chk1, CDC27, and
Eg5 (a mitotic motor protein; see Tables 1 and 3) indicate that
resveratrol may have a regulatory role both in G1 as well as in the S
and G2-M phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the microarray
results, when analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, also
indicated that resveratrol mediated alterations in both the G1
and the G2-M cell cycle canonical pathways. In the literature,
reports indicate that resveratrol affects different stages of the
cell cycle depending on the cancer cell type. The significance of
differential regulation by resveratrol in different tissue types is not
clear (1). However, chemopreventive agents have been known to
show target organ specificity and different modes of action.
We have used two novel assays to determine the route of
apoptosis in A549 cells by resveratrol. The poly caspase FLICA and
the Mito-PT assays verify the activation of the caspase and the loss
of the mitochondrial permeability transition, respectively. These
results are consistent with previously reported results in A549 cells
(20, 25) and in cancer cells of other organs such as breast, colon,
and leukemia (1).
The present study highlights the findings of resveratrol action on
the TGF-h pathway, particularly the Smad proteins (Fig. 3). TGF-h
binds to both types I and II receptors (TGF-h-RI and TGF-h-RII),

respectively. TGF-h-RII is constitutively active and phosphorylates
TGF-h-RI. TGF-h-RI, in turn, activates the receptor-regulated Smad
proteins, Smad2 and Smad3, whereas Smad5 and Smad8 are
regulated by bone morphogenetic proteins. There are a number of
mutations identified in human tumors, many of which result in
the loss of selective Smad proteins. This ultimately alters TGF-h
signaling. TGF-h plays a crucial role in tissue homeostasis through
the activation of the intracellular Smad proteins (30). The Smad
transcription factors and Smad-ubiquitin regulatory factor
(Smurf1) are involved in early embryonic morphogenesis of lungs
(31). However, the role of Smads and TGF-h signaling pathways has
not been reported in lung carcinogenesis or its prevention or
treatment (32, 33). Furthermore, alterations in the TGF-h pathway
affecting Smad proteins by resveratrol have not been investigated.
We illustrate that at the mRNA level, the Smad activators, Smad2
and Smad4 are down-regulated, and that the repressor Smad7 is
up-regulated following resveratrol treatment. Consistently, the
PowerBlot results showed the down-regulation of Smad2/3 at
the protein level. We hypothesize that this altered regulation of
the Smads leads to a block in the nuclear signaling of the TGF-h
pathway, which, in turn, results in the inhibition of A549 cell
proliferation.
Using this dual microarray-PowerBlot approach, we examined
the pathways of resveratrol-induced gene and protein expression
with two software packages, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and
PANTHER. The pathway results of the microarray complimented
those of the PowerBlot and vice versa (Table 2). Results showed
that altered expression changes matched between the microarray
and PowerBlot in a total of 23 genes/proteins that were on both
templates (Table 3). The discrepancies between the microarray

Molecular Mechanism of Resveratrol in Lung Cancer

(mRNA expression) and PowerBlot (protein expression) techniques
could represent altered posttranslational regulation or inherent
inaccuracies of these high-throughput techniques.
This in vitro study suggests that resveratrol is a potent inhibitor
of A549 lung cancer cell growth. A recent in vivo study by Berge
et al. (34) reported that resveratrol has no preventive effect on
benzo(a)pyrene-induced lung tumorigenesis in mice. The bioavailability of resveratrol to the lungs after being administered in the
diet in this study is probably the factor responsible for this
discrepancy. Resveratrol is known to be cleared from tissues
rapidly after p.o. administration in mice (35), and it is possible the
route/mode of administration needs to be altered for efficacy.
Moreover, benzo(a)pyrene induces lung adenoma in mice. It is
possible that resveratrol may not be efficacious against benign
adenoma induction in the lungs in this model. In addition, Berge
et al. in this study found no resveratrol or resveratrol conjugates
in the lung tissue of the mice following resveratrol treatment.

In conclusion, we have shown that resveratrol alters a large
number of genes and proteins and inhibits A549 cell proliferation
by inducing cell cycle arrest, inducing apoptosis, and by altering
the intracellular Smad signaling of the TGF-h pathway. Although
there are additional pathways identified by this combined
approach, their description is beyond the scope of this article.
Nevertheless, the benefits of using dual high-throughput techniques to unravel the molecular mechanisms of resveratrol is
emphasized in this report.
