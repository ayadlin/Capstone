Abstract
It has become clear that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway
is central for promoting both tumor and tumor stroma and is
therefore a major target for anticancer drug development.
First- and second-generation rapalogs (prototypical mTOR
inhibitors) have shown promise but, due to the complex
nature of mTOR signaling, can result in counterproductive
feedback signaling to potentiate upstream Akt signaling. We
present a novel PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor, Palomid 529
(P529), which inhibits the TORC1 and TORC2 complexes and
shows both inhibition of Akt signaling and mTOR signaling
similarly in tumor and vasculature. We show that P529
inhibits tumor growth, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability. It retains the beneficial aspects of tumor vascular
normalization that rapamycin boasts. However, P529 has the
additional benefit of blocking pAktS473 signaling consistent
with blocking TORC2 in all cells and thus bypassing feedback
loops that lead to increased Akt signaling in some tumor cells.

Introduction
In cancer, signaling alterations are evident in multiple components of the microenvironment. For example, we have found that
Akt signaling is increased in the tumor endothelium, likely from the
constant bombardment of growth factors from the activated tumor
and stroma. Importantly, inhibition of this pathway normalizes the
vasculature both structurally and, more importantly, from the
perspective of vascular function and barrier properties (1). Notably,
vascular normalization is proposed to be a key component of the
ability of bevacizumab (Avastin) to synergize with chemotherapy
and radiation (2). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is also a central
point of dysregulation in many cancer cells due to direct activating
mutations in the kinases or deletion of the PTEN phosphatase that
functions to negatively regulate this signaling pathway (3). Because
of the link between critical cancer cell receptors such as epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members, PI3K-Akt signaling
can be a complication in resistance to inhibitors of the EGFR

pathway in some tumors (4). In glioblastoma, it is not uncommon
to find both activating mutations in EGFR combined with deletion
of PTEN and increased efficacy has been shown by combining
EGFR inhibitors with rapamycin (5, 6). One of the major
downstream parts of the pathway is mTOR pathway, and this
pathway has been targeted by the mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and
more recent rapalogs (7, 8). However, the effects on signaling by
rapamycin are complicated by positive and negative feedback loops
from mTOR to Akt in different components of the tumor
microenvironment (9). TORC1 inhibition of rapamycin can lead
to increased Akt signaling due to relief of the S6K suppression of
IRS1, causing potentiation of PI3K signaling in many tumor cells
(10). On the other hand, stromal Akt signaling is repressed by the
same doses of rapamycin that lead to tumor up-regulation of Akt
signaling (11). This is possibly due to cell-specific sensitivities that
lead to indirect inhibition of TORC2 assembly (12, 13). Dual mTORPI3K or mTOR-Akt inhibitors may be a solution to these feedback
loops; however, in this article, we describe a novel inhibitor that is
both a TORC1 and TORC2 inhibitor and consistently downregulates Akt and mTOR signaling both in a PTEN mutant glioma
tumor cells and in endothelial cells. This drug is both antitumor
growth and antiangiogenic.

Materials and Methods
Animals and materials. Four- to 6-wk-old female athymic nu/nu mice
(National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) were used in our experiments.
Nonreplicating adenoviral vector was engineered to express the murine
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A164 isoform as described
previously (14). Recombinant vascular permeability factor/VEGF was
obtained from R&D Systems. Palomid 529 (P529) was provided from
Paloma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Wortmannin and okadaic acid (OA) were
purchased from Calbiochem, Inc. All antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology, except anti-h-actin, which was purchased from
Sigma. Animal protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Estrogen receptor binding assays. The proteins were produced with
rabbit reticulocyte lysates as supplied by Promega Corp. (TNT kit) that
couples transcription and translation in a single reaction. The amount of
template used in each reaction was determined empirically and expression
was monitored in parallel reactions where [35S]methionine was incorporated into the receptor followed by gel electrophoresis and exposure to film.
Binding reactions of the estrogen receptors (ER) and P529 were carried out
in 100 mL final volumes in TEG buffer [10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 1.5 mmol/L
EDTA, 10% glycerol]. In vitro transcribed-translated receptor (5 AL) was
used in each binding reaction in the presence of 0.5 nmol/L [3H]estradiol
(E2). All compounds were routinely tested from 10 11 to 10 6 mol/L and
diluted in ethanol. The reactions were incubated at 4jC overnight and
bound E2 was quantified by adding 200 mL dextran-coated charcoal. After a
15-min rotation at 4jC, the tubes were centrifuged for 10 min and 150 mL of
the supernatant were added to 5 mL scintillation mixture for determination

of cpm by liquid scintillation counting. The maximum binding was
determined by competing bound E2 with only the ethanol vehicle. Controls
for background were included in each experiment using 5 mL unprogrammed rabbit reticulocyte lysate. This value, typically 10% to 15% of the
maximal counts, was subtracted from all values. The data were plotted and
K i values were calculated using the Prism software. Experiments were
conducted at least thrice in duplicate.
Human umbilical vascular endothelial cell proliferation. Human
umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the required medium
complements were purchased from Cascade Biologics, and the growth and
maintenance of the cultures was as described by the manufacturer. The
proliferation assay was carried out by seeding the HUVECs in 96-well plates
at a density of 1,000 per well in complete medium. Following a 24-h plating
period, the cells were starved for 24 h in 0.5% serum before being treated
with P529 in the presence of 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)
or VEGF in complete medium. After 48 h, cell number was determined
using a colorimetric method as described by the supplier (Promega). The
results were expressed as the percentage of the maximal bFGF or VEGF
response in the absence of P529. Nonproliferating endothelial cells were
assayed by growing HUVECs to quiescence in 96-well plates and treating
with P529 for 48 h. Initially, 5,000 cells per well were seeded and confluence
was achieved the next day. The plates were incubated for another 24 h to
ensure growth arrest before treatment with P529. Cell number was
determined as outlined above.
HUVEC apoptosis. Cell death was monitored by quantifying the amount
of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments that accumulated in the
cell, method as described by the supplier (Roche). The method uses ELISA
detection with a monoclonal anti-histone antibody. Briefly, HUVECs were
trypsinized, diluted, and aliquoted into microfuge tubes at a concentration
of 50,000 per tube. Treatments were made with P529 at 10 mmol/L,
camptothecin at 4 mg/mL, or no addition for 6 h at 37jC followed by cell
lysis and analysis using the detection kit according to the manufacturer.
Apoptosis was quantified calorimetrically at an absorbance of 405 nm.
Cell culture. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs)
were isolated as previously described (15). HDMECs were cultured in EGM-2
medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and growth factors
(Clonetics) at 37jC and 5% CO2. C6V10 cells (rat C6 glioma cells) and U87 cells
(human glioma cells) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.
HDMEC and C6V10 cells were serum starved in EGM-2 medium
supplemented with 2% FCS and DMEM containing 2% FBS, respectively,
and pretreated with P529 (20 Amol/L) for 16 h. Before growth factor
stimulation for 15 min, cells were pretreated with wortmannin (50 nmol/L)
for 30 min or OA (100 nmol/L) for 2 h.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Proteins were extracted
from mouse tissue using T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent Buffer
(Pierce) containing 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 Ag/mL leupeptin, 0.5% aprotinin, and 2 Ag/mL
pepstatin A and from cultured cells using cell lysis buffer [20 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 mol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 Ag/mL
leupeptin, 0.5% aprotinin, and 2 Ag/mL pepstatin A]. Equal amounts of
protein were separated by NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen Corp.)
and transferred into nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes
were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4jC after blocking
with 5% milk in TBS-Tween 20 and then detected using horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(Amersham Biosciences UK), respectively, and SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate system (Pierce). All experiments were carried
out independently at least thrice. For immunoprecipitations, C6 glioma cells
were serum starved for 24 h. Before insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I
stimulation, cells were pretreated with P529 (20 Amol/L) for 2 or 24 h. Cell
lysis buffer consisted of 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.3% CHAPS, 25 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 1 Ag/mL leupeptin. Protein
(1.5 mg) diluted to 1 mL with cell lysis buffer was centrifuged at 10,000  g
for 10 min at 4jC to remove cellular debris. mTOR (1:100) antibody was
added and immune complexes were allowed to form by incubating with

rotation for overnight at 4jC. A 50% slurry (25 mL) of protein G-Sepharose
was then added and the incubation was continued for 3 h. Immunoprecipitates were captured with protein G-Sepharose, washed four times with cell
lysis buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting.
Tumor growth. Four- to 6-wk-old female nude mice were pretreated
with P529 (200 mg/kg/2 d, i.p.) for 1 wk, and then 1  105 C6V10 rat glioma
cells were injected s.c. (16). Treatment continued while tumors were
allowed to grow for 21 d. U87 cells (3  106/100 AL) were injected s.c. into
nude mice. From day 3 after injection of tumor cells, mice were treated by
micronized P529 at doses of 50 mg and 25 mg/kg/2 d i.p., respectively. Mice
without drug treatment served as controls. U87 tumors were allowed to
grow for 24 d. During drug treatment, tumor volumes were measured with a
caliper and estimated as length  width  width  0.53. Animals were
euthanized and the tumors were taken for immunohistologic and
immunoblotting studies.
Ad-VEGF–induced angiogenesis. Nonreplicating adenoviral vector
engineered to express the predominant (164 amino acids) murine isoform
of VEGF-A (1  107 plaque-forming units) was injected i.d. into the dorsal
ears of athymic nu/nu mice as described previously (14). P529 at 200 mg/
kg/2 d was administered i.p. into mice (n = 12) 1 wk before adenovirus
VEGF-A injection. Mice were harvested at day 5 after adenovirus injection.
Ears were mounted flat under the glass slide with immersion oil and
photography using a Wild M-400 photomicroscope. For evaluation of
permeability in the ears, mice were injected with 0.1 mL of 0.5% Evans blue
dye in saline i.v. After 30 min, ears were evaluated by photographed. For
quantitative analysis of vascular permeability, six mouse ears from P529treated and untreated mice were punched by 8-mm punch biopsy 30 min
after injection of Evans blue dye. Biopsies were incubated at 56jC water
bath for 48 h in 1 mL formamide. Amount of extracted Evans blue dye was
detected by absorbance at 620 nm in 96-well plate. For Miles vascular
permeability assay, 4- to 6-wk-old female athymic nu/nu mice were
pretreated 1 wk with P529 at 200 mg/kg/2 d i.p. before the Miles assay was
performed. Briefly, Evans blue dye (100 AL of a 1% solution in 0.9% NaCl)
was injected i.v. into mice. After 10 min, 50 AL of human VEGF165 (1 ng/AL)
or 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was injected i.d. into the back skin as a
control. After 20 min, the animals were euthanized, and an area of skin that
included the entire injection sites was removed and photographed.
Immunohistochemistry. Mouse tissues were immersed in freshly
prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.02 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)
for 4 h at room temperature, washed in PBS, and embedded in paraffin. For
phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and phosphorylated S6 (pS6) immunostaining,
tissue sections were hydrated and incubated in 3% H2O2 in methanol for
20 min, washed in water, and boiled in 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0) for 15 min.
Sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories)
and then incubated with primary antibody to pAkt (1:100 dilution) and pS6
(1:500 dilution) overnight at 4jC. Tissue sections were incubated with
secondary antibodies (1:400; Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room
temperature and detected by avidin-biotin complex method (ABC) kit
(Vector Laboratories). For CD31 immunostaining, 6-Am frozen sections
embedded in OCT were collected. After washing with PBS and blocking
with 5% goat serum, tissue sections were incubated with CD31 antibody
(1:300 dilution; BD Biosciences) overnight at 4jC. Then, sections were
washed by PBS again and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:400;
Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature and detected by
ABC kit.

Anticancer Properties of the P529 TORC1/TORC2 Inhibitor

ERs (ERa and ERh) were used as templates for in vitro
transcription and translation of radioactively labeled receptor
proteins for use in in vitro estrogen (E2) binding assays. The
maximal E2 binding was determined by competing bound E2 with
the ethanol vehicle. Values for percent inhibition were calculated
based on the maximal E2 binding. P529 was unable to bind ERa or
ERh, confirming that P529 no longer retained estrogen antagonism
functionality (Fig. 1A). The structure of this P529 is shown in
Fig. 1B.
To confirm that P529 retained antiangiogenic activity, however,
we used a variety of conventional endothelial assays. P529 inhibited
both VEGF-driven (IC50, 20 nmol/L) and bFGF-driven (IC50,
30 nmol/L) endothelial cell proliferation and retained the ability
to induce endothelial cell apoptosis (Fig. 1C). The added sensitivity
observed in stimulated cells suggests that P529 function is
dependent on signaling pathways stimulated by growth factors.
Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that P529 reduced
VEGF-A–driven phosphorylation of pAktS473, pGSK3hS9, and pS6.
However, P529 inhibited neither phosphorylated mitogen-activated
protein kinase (pMAPK) nor pAktT308 as potently as pAktS473. As
expected, wortmannin reduced phosphorylation of both pAktS473
and pAktT308 similarly. Furthermore, P529 was able to successfully
compete with OA to reduce phosphorylation of pAktS473, pGSKS9,
and pS6 but not pAktT308 (Fig. 1D). Together, these data implicate

P529 in the inhibition of AktS473 signaling in a relatively specific
manner.
We examined the antiangiogenic and antivascular function of
P529 in several in vivo assays. One commonly used assay for
pathologic angiogenesis is the oxygen-induced retinopathy in the
neonatal mouse (17). In this assay, neonatal P7 mice are placed into
hyperoxia (70% oxygen) where they experience loss of retinal blood
vessels. Following return to ambient oxygen 5 days later, there is
insufficient blood oxygen due to vessel loss to meet the demands of
the highly metabolically active retina, leading to a ‘‘relative’’
ischemia that triggers a pathologic angiogenic response. The
pathologic angiogenesis is characterized by the proliferation of
incompletely formed and aberrant vascular structures termed
glomeruloid tufts and highlighted by arrows in Fig. 2A. P529 not
only reduced the proliferative response in the ischemic retina but
also improved the organization and structure of the vessels that did
form (Fig. 2B). This result suggested that P529 might have activity
in multiple settings of pathologic angiogenesis, including cancer.
The second assay that was performed was the response to
VEGF-A in vivo, administered by adenovirus injection to the ear
(18). Figure 3A shows a dose-dependent inhibition of the Ad-VEGFA–driven angiogenesis following P529 treatment. In this assay, we
can harvest the ear tissue for analysis of signaling pathways. We
found that pAktS473 but not pAktT308 was potently inhibited by

compared with wortmannin and OA. MAPK signaling is shown as an example of an independent VEGF-A–driven signaling pathway not inhibited by P529.

P529 when assayed in whole ear lysates (Fig. 3B). Once again, there
did not seem to be an alteration in MAPK signaling. Histologic
analysis also revealed reductions in pAkt and pS6 antibody staining
in blood vessels (Fig. 3C). We also observed an overall reduction in
the number and sizes of blood vessels (detected with anti-CD31),
and an overall reduction in the thickness of the ear tissue and
tissue edema, which can indicate decreased vascular permeability.
Vascular permeability was assayed in two ways. First, a reduction
in Evans blue extravasation following drug treatment was
visualized in the ears and quantified by extraction of Evans blue
from ear tissue (Fig. 4A and B). However, in this assay, it is difficult
to eliminate the possibility that reduced extravasation was not
simply secondary to the changes in vascular density. Therefore, we
used the Miles assay to assess the effects of P529 on VEGF-induced
acute microvascular permeability in a 30-minute response in wildtype mice. This assay uses a small dermal injection of VEGF-A in
mice that have been previously injected with Evans blue i.v. The
response is photographed immediately following euthanization
and opening of the dorsal skin. The control for nonspecific
extravasation or bleeding to the i.d. injection is BSA, and this
typically gives a variable but small blue spot (both examples of BSA
treatment in this figure are within the reference range). In contrast,
VEGF-A (similar to other potent inducers of microvascular
permeability) reliably gives a very intense blue staining. After
pretreatment with P529, the intense VEGF response was greatly
reduced and not much greater than what we can observe with BSA
(Fig. 4C). Because there is no opportunity to alter the vasculature
density in this short assay, these results strongly implicate P529 in
directly reducing VEGF-driven vascular permeability.
Both the inhibition of vascular proliferation and the reduction of
permeability are expected to have an effect on cancer. It has been

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

suggested that a significant portion of the efficacy of bevacizumab
(Avastin; a VEGF-A antibody) is due to a reduction in permeability
in the tumor vessels, which in turn reduces interstitial pressure and
improves perfusion and drug delivery to the central parts of the
tumor (8). To test the potential of P529 as an anticancer drug, we
pretreated C6V10 glioma tumor cell cultures (19) with P529 and
stimulated with IGF (Fig. 5A). Similar to what we observed in VEGFtreated endothelial cells, P529 reduced phosphorylation of
pAktS473, pGSK3hS9, and pS6 but neither pMAPK nor pAktT308.
We also observed consistent results with wortmannin and OA in
tumor cells when compared with endothelial cells (compare with
Fig. 1). Because of the disconnection between inhibition of pAktS473
and pAktT308, we entertained the possibility that P529 may be a
TORC2 inhibitor (13). Based on the structure of P529, it is unlikely
that it represents a true ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor, but we
hypothesized that it may be an inhibitor of protein-protein interactions within the TORC2 complex that includes mTOR, rictor,
mLST8, and SIN1. Previously, TORC2 assembly was quantified by
immunoprecipitation of mTOR followed by Western blotting of
rictor (12). Therefore, we repeated this assay in the presence and
absence of P529 following IGF-I stimulation of C6V10 cells (Fig. 5B).
P529 inhibited the association of mTOR with rictor within 2 h.
Consistent with the efficient inhibition of S6 phosphorylation of
P529, we also observed inhibition in mTOR-raptor association,
suggesting that P529 inhibits both the TORC1 and TORC2 complexes.
These data predicted that P529 would likely inhibit the growth of
C6V10 tumor cells in mice due to its dual inhibition of tumor
and endothelial cell signaling. Figure 5C shows that P529 inhibited
C6V10 glioma tumor growth in nude mice following i.p. dosing.
Analysis of signaling within the tumor lysates revealed that P529
also reduced AktS473 but not AktT308 signaling in vivo (Fig. 5D).

Representative images are shown.

Examination of the tumor histology also revealed some
interesting findings that may have implications for therapeutic
use of P529. We used the C6 variant C6V10, which is transfected
with exogenous mouse VEGF-A164 for these studies, because we
have previously found them to have a more accurate vascular
pathology to represent high-grade glioblastoma, including glomeruloid vessels, which are not commonly found in mouse tumors.
Tumors from animals treated with P529 had reductions in tumor
vascular density as seen by staining tumor sections with anti-CD31
(Fig. 6A). Besides reductions in overall vascular density, we
observed a specific reduction in the size of glomeruloid vessels in
these tumors (Fig. 6B). Glomeruloid vessels are a hallmark of
glioblastoma (as they are of oxygen-induced retinopathy; see Fig. 2)

and can be partially recapitulated in these C6V10 glioma tumors
(note arrows). Glomeruloid vessels are characterized as large
disorganized patches of cells, including endothelial cells, pericytes,
and leukocytes, and surprisingly have stronger expression of pAkt
and pS6 than the surrounding tumor cells. This expression pattern
may explain their hypersensitivity to P529. In treated tumors, the
size and staining intensity of pAktS473 and pS6 were reduced.
Due to consistent difficulties with the solubility of P529, recent
micronization has led to a formulation with more potent efficacy
on C6V10 tumors in both i.v. and p.o. administration (data not
shown). We have never observed significant weight loss, lethargy,
or other indications of animal toxicity. However, these C6V10
tumors are relatively fast growing and we wanted to test P529 on a

slower-growing and independent glioma cell line. Using the
micronized formulation, we were able to potently inhibit tumor
growth of the human U87 cells at greatly reduced drug concentrations. This is a slower-growing tumor and treatment with 25 and
50 mg/kg/2 days dose dependently reduced tumor growth. Even
after 27 days of treatment, the animals still showed no signs of
toxicity (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, we conclude that P529 is a
novel and potent anticancer and antiangiogenic drug whose efficacy
in reducing glioma growth warrants additional investigation.

Discussion
In both tumor cells and endothelial cells, P529 similarly
reduces signaling from Akt pS473 in a relatively specific manner.
Previous studies on the Akt pathway in the tumor vasculature
suggest that Akt signaling promotes vascular dysfunction marked
by hyperpermeability (1, 16, 20). Reduced Akt-mTOR pathway
signaling was correlated to vascular normalization, which is
expected to enhance drug delivery to the tumor center (2). The
observations that signaling from Akt pS473 is more dramatically

Anticancer Properties of the P529 TORC1/TORC2 Inhibitor

Figure 6. P529 inhibited the Akt signaling and size of glomeruloid vessel
structures in C6V10 glioma tumors. A, representative tumor tissue sections from
untreated and P529-treated C6V10 glioma xenografts were stained with (A)
antibody to CD31 to visualize blood vessels (magnification, 10) and (B)
antibodies to pAkt and pS6 to highlight signaling in glomeruloid-like vessels.

reduced than Akt pT308 suggested the possibility that P529 is
competing directly with TORC2 (the mTOR-rictor complex that
phosphorylates pAktS473) or promoting activation of a specific
pAktS473 phosphatase such as PHLPP1/2 (13, 21, 22). Our studies
favor the former hypothesis because we find that P529 inhibits
coimmunoprecipitation of mTOR and rictor similar to what was
observed with long-term rapamycin treatment (12). However,
different from rapamycin, the disruption of TORC2 that occurs

within 2 h of P529 treatment is of similar efficiency as the
disruption in TORC1. The mechanism of rapamycin action is via
binding FKBP12 and interaction with TORC1 and not TORC2 (23).
In the study of rapamycin, it has been observed that inhibition of
pAkt occurs only as a secondary effect after prolonged treatment
and is less robust than inhibition of pS6K (12). In the case of
P529, we observe a comparable blockade of mTOR association
with both rictor and raptor, although we also do not have
detailed information on the specific molecular interactions that
prevent these mTOR interactions. Some possible mechanisms
include binding to mTOR to inhibit complex assembly or a
disruption of previously assembled complexes. Future studies of
structure and function of P529 in combination with TORC1/
TORC2 will be needed to firmly establish how P529 inhibits these
complexes. Although further studies are needed to fully elucidate
the mechanism of P529 action, it is clear that this inhibitor is a
novel tumor therapeutic with efficacy in the inhibition of tumor
cell growth, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability and can be
considered a TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor. Such a compound has the
potential to bypass complications of rapalogs where feedback
loops lead to a differential response in tumor and stromal cells,
similar to what has been sought by the design of dual mTOR/
PI3K inhibitors.
