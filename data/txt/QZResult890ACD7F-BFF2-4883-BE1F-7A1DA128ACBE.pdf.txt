ABSTRACT
Investigating existing drugs for repositioning can enable overcoming bottlenecks
in the drug development process. Here, we investigated the effect and molecular
mechanism of the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine (CPZ) and identified its potential
for treating colorectal cancer (CRC). Human CRC cell lines harboring different p53
statuses were used to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of CPZ. CPZ effectively
inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in CRC cells in a p53-dependent
manner. Activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was crucial for CPZ-induced
p53 expression and the subsequent induction of tumor apoptosis. Induction of p53
acetylation at lysine382 was involved in CPZ-mediated tumor apoptosis, and this
induction was attenuated by sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase. By
contrast, knocking down SIRT1 sensitized tumor cells to CPZ treatment. Moreover,
CPZ induced the degradation of SIRT1 protein participating downstream of JNK, and
JNK suppression abrogated CPZ-mediated SIRT1 downregulation. Clinical analysis
revealed a significant association between high SIRT1 expression and poor outcome
in CRC patients. These data suggest that SIRT1 is an attractive therapeutic target for
CRC and that CPZ is a potential repositioned drug for treating CRC.

and result in the inhibition of normal p53 function and loss
of suppressor function [2].
Several cellular stresses, such as oxidative stress,
hypoxia, DNA damage, and chemotherapeutics, can
activate p53. Once activated, p53 can execute its
cellular functions through a transcription-dependent or
-independent mechanism. In p53-dependent apoptosis,
p53 transactivates proapoptotic genes, including BAX,
PUMA, NOXA, and P21Waf1/Cip1. The p53 protein level can
be negatively modulated by MDM2 and MDMX, two
E3 ubiquitin–protein ligases that mediate p53 protein
degradation through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis [3].
Other posttranslational modifications of p53, such as

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common cancer
and the second cause of cancer-related death worldwide.
Genetic mutation is the major cause of colorectal
oncogenesis, and TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutation
occurs in approximately 40%–60% of patients with colon
cancer [1]. The protein p53 (encoded by the TP53 gene)
plays a crucial role in preventing cancer development and
progression by inducing growth arrest, senescence, or
apoptosis or by impeding tumor migration, invasion, or
angiogenesis. Approximately 75% of TP53 gene mutations
are point mutations, which lead to amino acid substitutions

acetylation, sumoylation, and phosphorylation, also
regulate p53 activity. Acetylation of p53 by p300/
CREB binding protein prevents MDM2-mediated
p53 degradation and increases p53 activity [4, 5]. By
contrast, deacetylation of p53 by deacetylases such
as histone deacetylase (HDAC) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)
destabilizes it and facilitates MDM2-mediated protein
degradation [6, 7]. Although wild-type p53 is expressed
in approximately 50% of patients with cancer, it
remains dysfunctional in these tumor cells because of
abnormally elevated levels of p53 suppressors such as
MDM2, MDMX, SIRT1, and HDACs [8–10]. Therefore,
several studies have emphasized the need to discover
small molecules that can inhibit p53 suppressors for
potential application in therapies for p53-harboring
cancers [11–13].
Developing new drugs for cancer treatment is a
time- and cost-intensive process. Unexpected toxicity
at any stage may cause failure during development.
Therefore, examining existing drugs for drug
repositioning is an effective strategy for accelerating
drug development and reducing investment risk [14].
Numerous studies have scanned existing drugs for
new indications in cancer therapy. For instance, the
antiinflammatory drug licofelone suppressed pancreatic
cancer progression [15]. Cholesterol biosynthesis
inhibitors, statins, suppressed tumor growth and
metastases in several types of cancer cells [16–18].
The type 2 diabetes drug metformin exhibited potent
antitumor activity against breast and brain cancer stem
cells [19–22]. These findings indicate that repositioning
drugs is a promising approach for cancer treatment. With
a recent advance in genomics, the Connectivity Map
database reveals potential connections between small
molecules and diseases. Among these small molecules,
antipsychotic drugs exhibited tumor suppression activity
[23, 24]; however, their detailed inhibitory activity and
mechanism remain unclear. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is
an FDA-approved phenothiazine derivative used to
treat schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. The
pharmacological mechanism of CPZ in schizophrenia
treatment is mediated through the blockage of dopamine
receptors. However, CPZ also exhibited antiproliferative
activity against brain tumors, probably through the
suppression of AKT/mTOR activation or the upregulation
of p21Waf1/Cip1 expression [25, 26]. However, the effect of
CPZ on CRC and its inhibitory mechanism have not been
reported.
This study investigated the molecular mechanism of
CPZ in CRC treatment. We observed that CPZ-induced
tumor apoptosis depended on p53 protein expression.
CPZ-induced p53 upregulation and acetylation were
mediated through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)dependent SIRT1 inhibition in CRC cells.

Identification of CPZ as a potent anti-coloncancer drug
CPZ (Figure 1A) is a phenothiazine derivative used
to treat psychotic disorders. To determine whether CPZ
has antitumor activity against CRC, HCT116 cells were
treated with 2.5–40 μM CPZ for 24 and 48 h. Results of
an MTT assay revealed that cell viability substantially
decreased after CPZ treatment. CPZ IC50 values at 24 and
48 h were 11.6 and 3.7 μM, respectively (Figure 1B). By
contrast, CPZ exhibited no obvious cytotoxic effect on
normal lung fibroblast WI38 cells up to a concentration
of 20 μM (Supplementary Figure S1). To determine
whether CPZ causes tumor apoptosis, HCT116 cells
were stained with 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). CPZ treatment induced a significant increase
in condensed nuclei, an indicator of cellular apoptosis
(Figure 1C). Results of flow cytometry obtained using
annexin V-propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells further
revealed that treatment with 5–20 μM CPZ increased
tumor apoptosis from 10% to 83% compared with that of
untreated cells (Figure 1D). Correspondingly, apoptotic
protein markers, as characterized by an increase in PARP
and caspase 3 cleavage and a decrease in the levels of the
antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-x, were detected
in a concentration- and time-dependent manner after
CPZ treatment (Figure 1E). However, pretreatment with
a caspase 3 inhibitor, z-DEVD-FMK, suppressed CPZinduced PARP and caspase 3 cleavage and suppressed cell
death (Figure 1F).

CPZ induces p53-dependent apoptosis in CRC
To determine whether CPZ induces tumor apoptosis
through a p53 mechanism, we treated HCT116 cells with
CPZ and analyzed them using Western blotting. The
results revealed that CPZ induced p53 protein expression
in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 2A). In
addition, CPZ treatment dose-dependently increased
p53 transcriptional activity (Figure 2B) and induced the
expression of p53 downstream target genes, including
TP53, p21, BAX, and NOXA (Figure 2C). CPZ slightly
increased p53 and p21 mRNA levels and significantly
induced BAX and NOXA expression. To verify that p53
is crucial for CPZ-mediated cell death, we analyzed the
responses of p53 and its downstream targets p21Waf1/Cip1,
BAX, and PARP to CPZ in different CRC cell lines. As
expected, protein levels of p53, p21waf1/Cip1, Bax,
and cleaved PARP increased in HCT116 and LoVo
cells, which contain wild-type p53. However, this effect
was not observed in p53-null HCT116 (p53 − / − ) and
HCT15 (MT p53) cells (Figure 2D). Similarly, results

than HCT116 (p53 − / − ), HCT15 (MT p53), and HT29

p53 participates in CPZ-mediated cell death.

of SIRT1-H363Y plasmid, a mutated SIRT1 without
deacetylase activity, did not prevent CPZ-induced p53
Lys382 acetylation and protein expression of p53, p21
Waf1/Cip1
, and PARP (Figure 4E upper panel). Similarly, the
overexpression of mutated SIRT1 failed to protect the cells
from CPZ-mediated cell death (Figure 4E lower panel).
To further delineate the crucial role of SIRT1 in
suppressing CRC apoptosis, SIRT1 was knocked down
in HCT116 cells and the cells were treated with CPZ.
The results indicated that CPZ treatment induced p53
acetylation and protein expression in mock knockdown
cells. However, CPZ treatment of SIRT1-knockdown
cells failed to induce further p53 protein expression
and acetylation. SIRT1 silencing robustly increased the
basal level and acetylation of p53 protein without CPZ
treatment (Figure 4F), and these data were consistent with
previous findings that SIRT1 negatively regulates p53
acetylation and protein stability. Nevertheless, knocking
down SIRT1 markedly enhanced CPZ-induced apoptotic
protein expression (Figure 4F) and enhanced susceptibility
to CPZ-elicited cell death (Figure 4G).

JNK activation is crucial in CPZ-mediated p53
expression and tumor apoptosis
Several lines of evidence have identified the
importance of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) family in p53 regulation [27]. To investigate
the signaling underlying CPZ-induced p53 expression,
we treated cells with inhibitors of the MAPK family.
Pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 abrogated
CPZ-induced p53 protein expression (Figure 3A).
Treatment with PD98059 and SB203580, inhibitors of
ERK and p38, respectively, did not suppress p53 protein
expression (Figure 3A). In addition, JNK phosphorylation
was detected in CPZ-treated cells (Figure 3B), and
SP600125 pretreatment suppressed CPZ-induced JNK
phosphorylation, which was accompanied by a reduction
in apoptotic protein levels elicited by CPZ (Figure 3C).
By contrast, neither PD98059 nor SB203580 treatment
suppressed CPZ-induced p53 and apoptotic protein
expression in both HCT116 and LoVo cells (Figure 3C).
Consistently, treatment with SP600125, but not SB203580
or PD98059, significantly blocked CPZ-induced
cytotoxicity in HCT116 cells (Figures 3D and 3E).
Overall, these data suggest that JNK activation is crucial
for CPZ-mediated tumor apoptosis.

CPZ induces SIRT1 protein degradation
To clarify the regulatory mechanism of CPZ in p53
acetylation, we analyzed the effects of CPZ on SIRT1. The
results of Western blotting showed that CPZ treatment
reduced the SIRT1 protein level in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 5A left panel). SIRT1 protein expression
decreased substantially 12 h after CPZ treatment,
whereas the SIRT1 mRNA level was unaffected by CPZ
treatment (Figure 5A right panel), suggesting that CPZ
attenuates SIRT1 protein stability. To test this hypothesis,
HCT116 cells were pretreated with cycloheximide, a
protein synthesis inhibitor, and then treated with CPZ.
As expected, CPZ promoted SIRT1 protein degradation
in the presence of cycloheximide (Figure 5B), and the
CPZ-elicited decrease in SIRT1 expression was recovered
in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132
(Figure 5C). Moreover, results of coimmunoprecipitation
analysis revealed that CPZ induced SIRT1 ubiquitination;
however, SP600125 pretreatment suppressed SIRT1
ubiquitination (Figure 5D and Supplementary Figure
S2A) and diminished CPZ-mediated SIRT1 suppression
(Figure 5E). These results indicate that CPZ induction of
p53 acetylation and tumor apoptosis might be mediated
through SIRT1 protein level suppression.

CPZ induces p53 acetylation, which is repressed
by SIRT1
Previous studies have reported that the acetylation
of p53 increases its transcriptional activity; therefore,
we investigated whether CPZ affects p53 acetylation.
HCT116 and LoVo cells were treated with CPZ and
subjected to Western blot analysis using a specific
antiacetylated p53 lysine382 (Lys382) antibody. Results
showed that CPZ induced p53 Lys382 acetylation in a
dose- and time-dependent manner (Figures 4A and 4C
upper panel). However, p53 Lys382 acetylation was
inhibited by the addition of SP600125, but not PD98059
or SB203580 (Figures 4B and 4C lower panel). Because
Lys382 is specifically deacetylated by SIRT1, we
examined whether SIRT1 overexpression diminishes the
effect of CPZ. SIRT1 overexpression affected the p53
protein level to a lesser extent than that observed in mock
cells, whereas it substantially reduced CPZ-induced p53
Lys382 acetylation and affected downstream targets of
p53, reducing p21Waf1/Cip1 expression and inducing PARP
cleavage (Figure 4D upper panel). Moreover, CPZ-elicited
growth inhibition was restored in SIRT1-overexpressing
cells (Figure 4D lower panel). By contrast, overexpression

activity of CPZ, we injected HCT116 (p53+/+) cells into

increased p53 protein expression and p53K382 acetylation
(Figure 6D). Conversely, the proliferative cell marker Ki67
decreased in CPZ-treated tumors (Figure 6D). In addition,
CPZ treatment induced tumor apoptosis, as observed in
terminal-deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays (Figure 6D). An
analysis of the protein levels in tumor extracts yielded
similar results; CPZ reduced SIRT1 and PCNA protein
expression, whereas it increased p53 and p21 expression,
p53K382 acetylation, and caspase 3 cleavage (Figure 6E).

had side effects on embryonic development. We used

significant phenotypic change between vehicle- and CPZtreated zebrafish embryos was observed throughout the

that CPZ effectively suppresses tumor growth and
induces apoptosis.

Clinical relevance of SIRT1 expression in CRC

cells [31], suggesting that CPZ is a potential agent for
cancer chemotherapy. We found that CPZ induced tumor
apoptosis and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in colon
cancer. Moreover, it induced tumor apoptosis in a p53dependent manner. The inhibitory activity of CPZ showed
specificity toward tumor cells and did not affect normal
fibroblasts. Moreover, CPZ had low toxicity in mice and
zebrafish embryos, suggesting that CPZ is highly toxic to
tumor cells. Nevertheless, further studies are required to
confirm these results.
SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase belongs to
the class III HDAC. SIRT1 is upregulated in patients with
prostate, breast, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers and
plays a critical role in tumor initiation, progression, and
drug resistance [32–35]. SIRT1 binds to and deacetylates
p53, thereby downregulating p53 transcriptional activity.
In addition to p53 deacetylation, Ku70, E2F1, and FOXO
deacetylation by SIRT1 is also involved in blocking
cellular senescence, differentiation, and apoptosis [36,
37]. Because of its overexpression in various malignancies
and its role in preventing apoptosis, SIRT1 is attractive
as a druggable target. For instance, tenovins and inauhzin
inhibit SIRT1, thus increasing p53 activity and suppressing
tumor growth [38, 39]. Inauhzin combined with
chemotherapeutic agents sensitizes cells to p53-depedent
cytotoxicity and tumor suppression [40]. Moreover, SIRT1
inhibition enhances the elimination of leukemia stem cells
in combination with imatinib [41] and sensitizes natural
compound-induced cell death in lung cancer cells [42].
SIRT1 was overexpressed in advanced-stage CRC tissues,
and SIRT1 overexpression was associated with decreased
survival in CRC patients, suggesting that high SIRT1
expression is associated with poor patient outcomes in
CRC and that SIRT1 is an attractive therapeutic target for
CRC. In the present study, CPZ-increased p53 Lys382
acetylation and transcriptional activity were associated
with SIRT1 inhibition, whereas ectopic SIRT1 expression
abolished CPZ-mediated p53 activation and tumor
apoptosis. Acetylation of p53 prevents its degradation
by MDM2 and increases its transcriptional activity [4].
In addition, acetylated p53 is required for Bax activation
through transcription-independent apoptosis regulation
[43]. Furthermore, CPZ reduced the SIRT1 protein level
in both p53 wild-type (HCT116 and LoVo) and mutant
(HCT15) cells (Supplementary Figure S2B), suggesting
that CPZ is a SIRT1 inhibitor and can treat p53 mutant
CRC cells by attenuating other SIRT1-dependent
oncogenic signaling pathways; however, additional
evidence supporting these inferences is required.
SIRT1 activity can be regulated through
posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation
and sumoylation [44, 45]. Previous studies have reported
that AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylates and
inactivates SIRT1, resulting in increased p53 acetylation
in liver cancer [46, 47]. Similarly, JNK activation induced

To validate the clinicopathological role of SIRT1 in
CRC progression, we examined the SIRT1 protein level in
a CRC tissue microarray by using immunohistochemistry.
SIRT1 was highly expressed in approximately 65%
(69 of 106) of CRC specimens, as demonstrated by strong
immunoreactivity (Figure 7A). Moreover, SIRT1 protein
expression was significantly elevated in advanced tumor
stages (75%, 37 of 49 cases) compared with that in stage
I + II (54%, 31 of 57 cases) (Figure 7A). We also analyzed
the prognostic value of the SIRT1 mRNA level on the
basis of two independent cohort studies and observed a
significant correlation between high SIRT1 expression and
decreased disease-free survival (pooled GSE14333 and
GSE17536 CRC data sets, P = 0.011; HR = 1.663, 95%
CI of ratio = 1.123–2.457; n = 351). Notably, patients with
a high SIRT1 level exhibited poor cancer-specific survival
(GSE17536 CRC data sets, P = 0.016; HR = 1.863, 95%
CI of ratio = 1.12 − 3.09; n = 177) (Figure 7B). These data
suggest that high SIRT1 expression contributes to CRC
progression.

DISCUSSION
Although the TP53 tumor suppressor gene is
frequently mutated in CRC, approximately 50% of
cancer patients still have wild-type p53; thus, targeting
the p53 pathway is a promising approach for cancer
therapy. However, several p53 negative regulators, such
as MDM2, MDMX, SIRT1, and HDACs, are abnormally
elevated in tumor cells [8, 9], inactivating p53. Therefore,
identifying drugs that can target these p53 suppressors
and be used in monotherapy or combination therapy is
an alternative approach [28–30]. However, traditional de
novo drug discovery often takes more than 15 years, and
the probability of success is lower than 10%. Repositioned
drugs can be used to reduce the development time and
risks because these drugs have already been used in
clinics; thus, their toxicology, safety, and pharmacokinetic
profiles have been studied extensively. In this study,
we found that the antipsychotic drug CPZ effectively
suppressed CRC growth by inducing the p53-dependent
apoptotic process. CPZ induced JNK activation, which
destabilized the SIRT1 protein level, increasing p53
acetylation and activation and consequently promoting
tumor apoptosis (Figure 8).
CPZ is an FDA-approved antipsychotic drug used
to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and has shown
potent antitumor activity in recent studies. CPZ inhibited
cell-cycle progression in rat glioma C6 cells by inducing
p21Waf/Cip1/Egr1 expression [25] and induced autophagic
cell death by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway in human
glioma U87-MG cells [26]. In addition, CPZ enhanced
therapeutic efficacy in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer

by insulin treatment promotes SIRT1 degradation and
inactivation in hepatocytes [48]. By contrast, Nasrin
and colleagues reported that JNK phosphorylates and
increases SIRT1 enzymatic activity in response to
oxidative stress [49], contradicting our finding that
JNK activation is crucial for CPZ-mediated SIRT1
ubiquitination and degradation. Our data showed
that treatment with a JNK inhibitor suppressed CPZinduced tumor apoptosis and abolished CPZ-elicited
SIRT1 degradation and p53 acetylation. In addition,

JNK activation has been demonstrated to be crucial for
p53 protein phosphorylation and transcriptional activity.
Our study showed that CPZ activated JNK, at least partly,
by inhibiting the SIRT1 protein level, thus increasing
p53 acetylation and promoting tumor apoptosis. In
conclusion, our study provides new insight into the
repositioning of antipsychotic drugs for CRC treatment.
CPZ exerts proapoptotic activity in CRC through JNKmediated SIRT1 inhibition and p53 activation and could
be a promising therapeutic agent and supplement for CRC

in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. The HCT15,
HT29, and LoVo cells were maintained in RPMI at 37°C
in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. All culture
media were supplemented with 7% heat-inactivated FBS,
100 units (U)/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin
(Gibco). The cell lines were authenticated using a short
tandem repeat profiling analysis to ensure that no culture
contamination occurred.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and cell lines
CPZ was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
PD98059, SB203580, SP600125, and MG132 were
obtained from Merck Millipore. The human CRC cell lines
HCT116 (wild-type p53), LoVo (wild-type p53), HCT15
(mutant p53), and HT29 (mutant p53) were purchased
from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center
(Hsinchu, Taiwan). The HCT116 cells were maintained
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Plasmids and transfection
Wild-type and mutant (H363Y) SIRT1-expressing
vectors (gifts from Michael Greenberg; Addgene #1791
and #1792) were subcloned into the pCMV6-entry vector
(Origene). To establish a stable SIRT1-knockdown cell

line, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with hairpin
pLKO-shSIRT1 vectors (National RNAi Core Facility,
Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan), a packaging plasmid
(pCMV-∆R8.91), and an envelope (pMDG) plasmid.
Transduced cells were selected using puromycin (2 μg/
mL) [50]. To measure the effect of CPZ on p53 activity,
HCT116 cells were seeded into 24-well plates and
transfected with a PG13-luc plasmid containing 13 copies
of the wtp53-binding sites (a gift from Bert Vogelstein;
Addgene plasmid #16442). CPZ was then added, the cells
were incubated for 18 h, and p53 activity was measured
using a luciferase assay kit (Promega).

priate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Genetex) for 1 h at room temperature, and
proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Millipore). Protein expression was quantified
using ImageJ software. Data are expressed as the mean ±
standard error (SE) and represented as fold changes relative to the control, n = 3. Details on the antibodies used are
listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plus Mini
Kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was
performed using the resulting cDNA, a LightCycler 480
SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche), and a LightCycler
480 System (Roche). The results were calculated using
the equation for ∆∆CT and are expressed as fold changes
relative to the control sample. GAPDH was used as
an internal control for normalization. Specific primer
sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2.

Cell viability
Cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a
concentration of 1 × 105 cells per well. The cells were
refed with a complete growth medium containing CPZ
(0–40 μM) or pretreated for 1 h with caspase 3 inhibitors
(z-DEVD-FMK) or MAPK (PD98059, SP600125, and
SB203580). After 24–48 h of incubation, the growth
medium was removed and the cells were refed with
a growth medium containing MTT (50 μg/mL) and
incubated further for 1 h. Formazan crystals were
dissolved in isopropanol, and absorbance was determined
using an ELISA reader (Dynatech MR-7000; Dynatech
Laboratories) at a wavelength of 600 nm. Cell viability
was expressed as a percentage of untreated control cells.

Animal study
HCT116 (2 × 106) cells were injected into the dorsal
flank of 6- to 8-week-old NOD/SCID mice (n = 6 in each
group). When the tumor volume reached 300 mm3, the
mice were intravenously administered CPZ (10 mg/kg)
or PBS (vehicle control) every 2 or 3 days for 3 weeks.
The body weights and tumor burdens of the mice were
monitored every 3 days during the experiments. Tumor
volume was calculated using the following equation:
length × (width)2 × 0.52. All animals were cared for in
a specific-pathogen-free room and treated in accordance
with the animal care protocol approved by an animal
committee.

Apoptosis detection
HCT116 cells (105/well) were seeded onto cover
slides and treated with CPZ for 24 h. The slides were fixed
in methanol and stained with DAPI at room temperature
for 30 min. Apoptotic nuclei were observed using a
fluorescent microscope and determined by calculating the
percentage of bright and condensed nuclei among the total
number of cells. To detect cellular apoptosis, the HCT116
cells were treated with CPZ for 24 h and incubated with
annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and PI solutions (BD
Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The cells were analyzed using the FACSCanto II flow
cytometry system and FACSDiva software v6.1 (BD
Biosciences).

Immunohistochemistry
A colon cancer tissue microarray (BC51110) was
purchased from Biomax. The slides were deparaffinized,
rehydrated, and heated in a sodium citrate buffer (0.01 M,
pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. The slides were incubated
with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol and 1% BSA to
block endogenous peroxidase activity and nonspecific
binding, respectively. The slides were then incubated
overnight with SIRT1 antibodies at 4°C and washed three
times by using PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. The slides
were treated with a polymer-HRP IHC detection reagent
(BioGenex), and 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine was used as a
chromogen to visualize peroxidase activity.

Western blotting
The cells were lysed using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl at
pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
and 0.1% SDS) containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Equal amounts of proteins were
separated using SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The
membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/
TBST and incubated overnight with specific primary antibodies. The membranes were then incubated with approwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Clinical relevance of SIRT1
Two CRC microarray data sets, GSE14333 [51] and
GSE17536 [52], were downloaded from the Gene Expression

and data on the SIRT1 mRNA level (probe ID: 218878_s_at)
were extracted. SIRT1 mRNA levels higher than the average
value were classified into a SIRT1-high group, whereas
others were classified into a SIRT1-low group. A Kaplan–
Meier survival curve was constructed using GraphPad
Prism 5 software. P values were analyzed using the log-rank
