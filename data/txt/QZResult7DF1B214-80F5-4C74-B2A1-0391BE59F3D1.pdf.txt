Abstract
A critical first step in the personalized approach to cancer treatment is the
identification of activated oncogenes that drive each tumor. The Identification of
driver oncogenes on a patient-by-patient basis is complicated by the complexity of
the cancer genome and the fact that a particular genetic alteration may serve as a
driver event only in a subset of tumors that harbor it. In this study, we set out to
identify the complete set of functional oncogenes in a small panel of breast cancer
cell lines. The cell lines in this panel were chosen because they each contain a
known receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) oncogene. To identify additional drivers,
we integrated functional genetic screens with copy number and mutation analysis,
and cancer genome knowledge databases. The resulting functional oncogene
signatures were able to predict responsiveness of cell lines to targeted inhibitors.
However, as single agents, these drugs had little effect on clonogenic potential.
By contrast, treatment with drug combinations that targeted multiple oncogenes
in the signatures, even at very low doses, resulted in the induction of apoptosis
and striking synergistic effects on clonogenicity. In particular, targeting a driver
oncogene that mediates AKT phosphorylation in combination with targeting the
anti-apoptotic BCL2L1 protein had profound effects on cell viability. Importantly,
because the synergistic induction of cell death was achieved using low levels of each
individual drug, it suggests that a therapeutic strategy based on this approach could
avoid the toxicities that have been associated with the combined use of multipletargeted agents.

Introduction

has become a cornerstone for the development of targeted
cancer therapeutics because it results in cells that are
dependent on the oncogene for survival, and increases
the sensitivity of the addicted cells to oncogene-targeted
drugs which provides the therapeutic index needed for
cancer cell specific effects on viability [2]. There is ample
evidence in support of this hypothesis from laboratory
studies, but the most compelling evidence comes from
clinical studies involving targeted agents such as imatinib
[3–6], trastuzumab [7–9], erlotinib [10], and vemurafinib

Cancer is a genomic disease that results from the
progressive acquisition of dominant genomic alterations
in driving oncogenes and recessive mutations in tumor
suppressor genes. Laboratory and clinical investigations
have demonstrated that human cancer cells become
dependent on the activity of driver oncogenes for the
expression of transformed phenotypes and for their
survival. This idea, known as oncogene addiction [1, 2],

[11] which have yielded dramatic clinical responses
when the cognate driving oncogene is present in the
treated cancer cells. However, it has also been repeatedly
observed that clinical responses to these targeted agents,
even when they are dramatic, are transient and followed
by recurrences of the disease. It is increasingly clear
that multiple driver oncogenes become activated during
the evolution of most solid tumors, resulting in cancer
cells that harbor complex oncogene signatures, and we
hypothesize that these complex oncogene signatures help
to explain the transient response of cancer cells to attack
on a single oncogene.
In this study, we set out to identify the complete set
of driver oncogenes that are functioning in a small panel
of breast cancer cell lines. We refer to this complete set of
oncogenes as the functional oncogene signature of the cell
line.   In order to determine functional oncogene signatures
for each cell line, we combined results of genome-wide
functional genetic screens with copy number analysis,
exome sequencing data, and cancer knowledge databases. 
Elucidation of functional oncogene signatures allowed us
to identify novel driver oncogenes in each cell line, and
accurately predicted the responsiveness and sensitivity of
the cell lines to targeted drugs. The oncogene signatures
also allowed us to identify drug combinations that resulted
in striking, synergistic effects on breast cancer cell
viability. Our results specifically support a therapeutic
strategy targeting a driver oncogene that mediates AKT
phosphorylation in combination with targeting the antiapoptotic BCL2L1 protein when it is part of the functional
oncogene signature. The synergy observed using this
approach suggests that an effective response can be
achieved using low levels of each individual drug and
thereby avoid toxicities that have hampered the use of
combination therapies in the clinic.

amplified genes are likely to be functioning as activated
driver oncogenes, with the remaining alterations being
likely passenger genes.  
To determine which of the amplified genes in each
cell line play a functional role in driving cell growth
and viability, and are therefore likely activated driver
oncogenes, we performed a genome-scale shRNA growth
and viability screen on each cell line. For each screen,
cells were transduced with a library of 82,000 lentiviral
vectors expressing shRNAs targeting 15,377 cellular
genes, with a minimum of four shRNAs per gene. Cells
were harvested at day 3 after selection and again after
approximately 5–7 population doublings. The abundance
of shRNAs at both time points was determined by
next-generation sequencing of PCR-amplified shRNAassociated barcodes.  Fold depletion values were used to
calculate a gene level score for each gene and gene level
scores were then used to identify significantly depleted
genes (See Methods and [16, 17]) (Supplementary Tables
5–8).
Integrating the data from the shRNA screens with
the gene copy number data allowed us to identify the copy
number amplified genes that were also essential for growth
and viability of the cells. Tables 1–4 show the results of
this analysis for each of the four cell lines.  This analysis
dramatically reduced the number of candidate oncogenes
in each of the cell lines from hundreds, to less than 50.
Interestingly, we observed that in all four cell lines, the
majority of amplicons harbored multiple genes that
were hits in the screen. This result is consistent with the
hypothesis that amplicons are selected for during cancer
evolution because they harbor multiple genes important to
the growth and survival of the cancer cells.
Next, to define functional oncogene signatures
with the greatest relevance to human cancer generally,
we filtered the list of amplified genes that were hits in
the shRNA screen using the Genomic Identification of
Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) database (http://
www.broadinstitute.org/tcga/home) [18, 19] and the
cancer Gene Ranker database (http://cbio.mskcc.org/
tcga-generanker/batch.jsp) (Tables 1–4).  This approach
allowed us to focus on candidate oncogenes that are
located in regions of recurrent amplification in primary
human cancers as defined by GISTIC, and are considered
to be important cancer genes as determined by Gene
Ranker (Gene Ranker score ≥ 1).   This analysis again
significantly reduced the number of candidate oncogenes
in each of the cell lines (Table 5).
Point mutations are another mechanism by which
oncogenes can become activated.  To include oncogenes
activated by point mutation in the functional oncogene
signatures, we integrated the shRNA screen data with
exome sequencing data.   Before integrating the exome
sequencing data with the shRNA screen data, the exome
sequencing data was first filtered using the Catalog of
Somatically Mutated Genes in Cancer (COSMIC; cancer.

Results
Elucidation of functional oncogene signatures in
a small panel of breast cancer cell lines
A primary goal of the experiments reported here
was to elucidate complete functional oncogene signatures
for a small panel of SUM breast cancer cell lines [12],
each of which is known to harbor a driving RTK oncogene
activated by amplification (SUM-52/FGFR2, SUM-185/
FGFR3, SUM-225/HER2, SUM-190/HER2) [13, 14].  In
order to elucidate the functional oncogene signature for
each of these cell lines, we first determined gene copy
number status in each cell line because gene amplification
is a common mechanism of oncogene activation. Array
comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed that
each cell line harbors hundreds of genes that are copy
number amplified (Supplementary Tables 1–4). This
large number of amplified genes is a common feature of
breast cancers [15]; however, only a small number of the

sanger.ac.uk) [20] database to identify only the variants
that have been shown to be recurrent somatic mutations in
human cancer.  In each cell line, this reduced the number
of genes harboring mutations to less than 30. In the
SUM-190 and SUM-185 cell lines, merging the mutated
gene lists with the shRNA screen hits identified a single
gene, the well-characterized driver oncogene PIK3CA
[21–24].  Both cell lines harbor the H1047R substitution
mutation, which is one of the most commonly reported
activating mutations for PIK3CA in breast cancer [21,
25, 26].  The SUM-52 and SUM-225 cell lines also each
contained a single point mutated gene that was a hit in
the shRNA screen although in both cases the identified
mutation was only rarely observed in primary cancers.
Combining this analysis of point mutated genes with the
analysis of copy number amplified genes resulted in a final
functional oncogene signature for each cell line (Table 5). 

revealed that 430/1105 (39%) samples harbor BCL2L1
copy number gain and 23/1105 (2%) harbor a high-level
focal amplification as determined by GISTIC (Figure 1C).
Additionally, there is a trend towards increased expression
with increasing levels of gene copy number which is a
characteristic of driver oncogenes that are activated by
amplification (Figure 1C). Taken together, these results
suggest that functional oncogene signatures can accurately
predict drug sensitivity and specifically support a role
for BCL2L1 as a novel driver oncogene and potential
therapeutic target in a subset of breast cancers.
In order to further test the ability of the functional
oncogene signatures to predict sensitivity to targeted
therapies, we examined the response of our cell line
panel to inhibitors that target each of the remaining
druggable driver oncogenes. The SUM-52 and SUM185 cell lines each have FGFR family members in their
oncogene signatures and we and others have demonstrated
previously the extreme sensitivity of SUM-52 cells to
FGFR2 inhibitors [28–30]. Treating the cell line panel
with the small molecule FGFR inhibitor, PD173074 [31],
showed that SUM-52 and SUM-185 cells were both
highly sensitive to this drug with IC50 values ~.05uM
(Figure 2A). Thus, for these two cell lines, having an
FGFR family member as part of the functional oncogene
signature was predictive of sensitivity to the appropriate
targeted drug.
The SUM-225 and SUM-190 cell lines were
chosen for these studies because they were known to
harbor an amplification and overexpression of the HER2
oncogene [14]. Interestingly, whereas HER2 (as well as
its neighbor on the amplicon GRB7) was a hit in the SUM225 shRNA screen, HER2 was not a hit in the SUM-190
screen. Examining the sensitivity of the cell line panel
to the HER2 inhibitor CP724721 [32] showed that while
SUM-52 and SUM-185 cells were unresponsive to this
drug, SUM-225 cells were highly sensitive (Figure 2B).
By contrast, while SUM-190 cells were responsive to
this inhibitor, the IC50 value was 10-fold greater than for
SUM-225 cells. This result helps to explain why HER2
was not a hit in the shRNA screen in SUM-190 cells, as
these cells are relatively resistant to targeting HER2.
Examining the sensitivity of the cell line panel to the
small molecule PIK3CA inhibitor A66 showed that SUM185 cells which harbor an activating PIK3CA mutation
were indeed, more than 10-fold more sensitive to A66 than
any of the other cell lines, including SUM-190 (Figure 2C).
The SUM-190 cells exhibited the same sensitivity to this

Oncogene signatures predict sensitivity to
molecularly targeted drugs
We hypothesized that the identified functional
oncogene signatures would be able to accurately predict
sensitivity to targeted therapies. To test this hypothesis,
we identified genes in each functional oncogene signature
that have an available targeted inhibitor. Six genes were
identified overall (BCL2L1, CDK6, PIK3CA, FGFR2,
FGFR3, and HER2), with each cell line signature
containing at least one druggable driver oncogene. The
BCL2L1 gene, which is part of the SUM-185 functional
oncogene signature, was of particular interest because
a role for amplified BCL2L1 as a driver oncogene in
breast cancer has not been previously characterized. We
therefore tested the cell line panel for sensitivity to the
BCL2L1-targeted drug Navitoclax [27]. As predicted
from the functional oncogene signature, SUM-185 cells
were highly sensitive to this drug and were the most
sensitive cell line in our panel with an IC50 in a growth
assay of approximately 0.1 µM (Figure 1A). Because
BCL2L1 has not been previously characterized as a
driver oncogene in breast cancer, we used the TCGA cell
line database (http://www.cbioportal.org/) to identify an
additional breast cancer cell line, HCC38, which also
harbors a focal amplification of BCL2L1. Interestingly,
treatment of HCC38 cells with Navitoclax revealed a high
level of sensitivity that was equivalent to that of SUM185 cells (Figure 1B). Querying the TCGA database

drug as SUM-52 and SUM-225 cells even though they
also harbor an activating PIK3CA mutation. It is possible
that the presence of PIK3CA mutations in the context of
HER2 amplifications could result in reduced sensitivity to
either drug target alone by compensating for each other in
the presence of a single agent [33].
Finally, since CDK6 was part of the functional
oncogene signature in SUM-52 cells, we examined the
cell line panel for sensitivity to the CDK4/6 inhibitor
palbociclib [34]. All four cell lines displayed similar
sensitivity to palbociclib thus, in this case, CDK6 being a
functional oncogene did not predict enhanced sensitivity
to palbociclib (Figure 2D). Looking only at shRNA screen
data, CDK6 was a hit in both the SUM-52 and SUM-185
cell lines but not in the SUM-190 or SUM-225 cell lines.
Therefore, the shRNA screen data alone was also not
predictive of response to palbociclib.

therefore performed experiments to determine if targeting
multiple oncogenes in a signature would yield synergistic
interactions specific to an individual cell line. For these
experiments we performed clonogenic survival assays
(colony-forming assays) to determine if drug combinations
could have irreversible effects on the proliferative capacity
of the cells. We have previously demonstrated that for
SUM-52 cells, 72 hour exposure to the FGFR inhibitor
PD173074, while resulting in complete inhibition of
proliferation, had only a small effect on colony-forming
ability once the drug was removed [17], indicating that the
effects of this drug on growth were reversible. We have
reported similar results with other small molecule kinase
inhibitors in other breast cancer cell lines [43]. Thus, the
experiments reported here were aimed at identifying drug
combinations that would result in irreversible effects on
growth and clonogenicity.
The SUM-185 cell line functional oncogene
signature suggested an obvious combination strategy
involving small molecule inhibitors that target each of
three oncogenes in the signature, FGFR3, PIK3CA and
BCL2L1. We therefore performed a clonogenic survival
assay in which SUM-185 cells were treated with IC50
concentrations of the FGFR, PI3’K, or BCL2L1 inhibitors
alone, or the two- and three-drug combinations. As
expected from previous experiments, we observed that
treatment with individual drugs resulted in little or no
effect on colony forming ability (Figure 3A and 3B). In
stark contrast, combined treatment of SUM-185 cells

Beyond predicting sensitivity to individual targeted
agents, elucidation of functional oncogene signatures
offers an opportunity to correctly predict effective
targeted drug combinations.
Combining multiple
targeted therapies has been proposed as an approach for
improving patient response rates and also for serving as
a barrier to the development of resistance [35–42]. We

by approximately 50-fold. The similarity of the results
for the FGFR and PI3’K inhibitors in combination
with the BCL2L1 inhibitor is in agreement with our
recently published results showing that in SUM-185
cells, FGFR3 and PIK3CA both function to drive AKT
phosphorylation [44]. These results suggest that, in the

functional oncogenes resulted in an 800 fold reduction in
colony forming (Figure 3A, 3B and 3D). Examining the
results of the two-drug combination treatments revealed
that combining Navitoclax with either the FGFR or the

context of a functional oncogene signature, targeting
a driver oncogene that mediates AKT phosphorylation
in combination with targeting BCL2L1 has synergistic
effects on cell viability even when the drugs are used at
low doses. Importantly, treatment of the non-transformed
breast epithelial cell line MCF10A with these drug
combinations showed no effect on colony-forming ability
(Figure 3C and 3D), demonstrating the specificity of this
response for transformed cells. Treatment of SUM-185
cells with the three-drug combination induced changes
in cell morphology indicative of an apoptotic response
(Supplementary Figure S1) and subsequent examination
of cell extracts indeed showed potent activation of caspase
3 even at the earliest time point (Figure 3E) suggesting
that the observed loss of cell viability was due to induction
of apoptosis.

(Figure 4). For these experiments, we examined levels of
AKT phosphorylation in each cell line following treatment
with an inhibitor of the RTK oncogene (PD173074
or CP724721), a pan-PI3’K inhibitor (BKM-120), a
PIK3CA specific inhibitor (A66), or an allosteric AKT
inhibitor (MK-2206). In SUM-52 cells, treatment with
the FGFR inhibitor resulted in effective inhibition of AKT
phosphorylation similar to what was observed in SUM-185
cells (Figure 4A and 4B). We therefore tested the effect of
the FGFR/BCL2L1 combination therapy in a clonogenic
survival assay on SUM-52 cells but because SUM-52 cells
were more resistant than SUM-185 cells to the BCL2L1
inhibitor (Figure 1A and 1B), we tested Navitoclax at both
1µM and at the IC50 concentration for SUM-185 cells
of 0.1 µM. The results of this experiment demonstrated
that, similar to what we observed for SUM-185 cells,
there was a synergistic effect of the FGFR/BCL2L1 drug
combination on colony-forming ability (Figure 5A and 5B).
The synergy was more profound at the higher Navitoclax
dose of 1µM however, it should be noted that this level of
Navitoclax treatment also reduces colony-forming ability
in the non-transformed MCF10A cell line (data not shown).
In SUM-190 cells, treatment with a 1uM dose of
the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206 effectively inhibits
AKT phosphorylation (Figure 5C). Combined treatment
of SUM-190 cells with 1uM MK-2206 and the BCL2L1
inhibitor did not result in a synergistic effect on colonyforming ability. Similarly, in SUM-225 cells 1uM MK-

Based on the results described above, we
hypothesized that inhibition of AKT phosphorylation
in combination with BCL2L1 inhibition may induce
synergistic cancer cell death in other cancer cell lines.
In order to test this hypothesis, we first identified small

2206 effectively inhibited AKT phosphorylation (Figure
5D) and combining this treatment with the BCL2L1
inhibitor did not result in a synergistic effect. These results
indicate that the synergistic response to dual inhibition of
BCL2L1 activity and AKT phosphorylation is cancer cell
line-specific and can be predicted by the presence of drug
targets in the cell line functional oncogene signature.

drugs that target functional oncogenes. Thus, the SUM52 and SUM-185 signatures contain FGFR2 and FGFR3
respectively and these cells are exquisitely sensitive to the
small molecule FGFR inhibitor PD173074. Similarly,
SUM-185 cells, which have a PIK3CA mutation were
most sensitive to the PI3’K inhibitor A66. SUM-225 cells,
with HER2 (and GRB7) in the oncogene signature were
highly sensitive to the HER2 specific drug CP274174.
Interestingly, SUM-190 cells also have a HER2
amplification and over-expression, but neither HER2 nor
GRB7 were hits in the screen, and thus neither gene is part
of the SUM-190 functional oncogene signature. SUM190 cells, while responsive to the HER2 inhibitor, were
10-fold more resistant than SUM-225 cells. SUM-190
cells also harbor an activating PIK3CA mutation and,
surprisingly, were no more sensitive to PI3’K inhibitors
than other cell lines without PIK3CA mutations. Also,
in that regard, CDK6 amplification was not predictive of
increased sensitivity to palbociclib.
Among the novel breast cancer oncogenes identified
in this study was the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2L1.
BCL2L1 plays a role in promoting survival in several solid
tumor types [45–48] and has been recently implicated as
an amplified driver oncogene in colorectal cancer and

Discussion
In this study, we defined functional oncogene
signatures for a panel of breast cancer cell lines that share
the common feature of each having one known amplified
and over-expressed RTK oncogene. To define functional
oncogene signatures, we integrated genomic profiling for
each cell line with genome-wide functional genetic screens
and data from cancer knowledge databases. This analysis
identified known as well as novel driver oncogenes for
each cell line. Using the functional oncogene signatures,
we accurately predicted sensitivity to small molecule
inhibitors and rationally designed combination therapies
that synergistically induced cancer cell death.
In most, but not all cases, the functional oncogene
signatures accurately predicted increased sensitivity to

gastric cancer [18, 49–51]. Small molecules that bind
to and inhibit the anti-apoptotic function of BCL2L1
and the related BCL2 protein have been developed and
are currently in phase I/II clinical trials. In our study, we
observed that BCL2L1 was amplified and over-expressed
in the SUM-185 cell line and was also a strong hit in the
functional genetic screen (5th ranked gene out of 1266
hits). Growth assay experiments showed that SUM185 cells were highly sensitive to the BCL2L1 inhibitor
Navitoclax, which is consistent with a role for BCL2L1 as
a driver oncogene in this cell line. We also identified an
additional breast cancer cell line with amplification and
over-expression of BCL2L1 and showed that this cell line
was similarly sensitive to BCL2L1 inhibition. Data from
the TCGA database indicates that a significant portion of
breast cancers harbor amplification and/or overexpression
of BCL2L1. These results suggest that BCL2L1 is a
driver oncogene in a subset of breast cancers and that
those patients with BCL2L1 as part of their oncogene
signature may benefit from therapies targeting BCL2L1.

We also found that when multiple oncogenes in
the oncogene signature were targeted, cells were not
only inhibited in their proliferation, but their clonogenic
capacity was dramatically reduced. This was particularly
true when a drug that targeted a driving oncogene that
resulted in down-regulation of AKT-phosphorylation
was combined with inhibition of BCL2L1. In a previous
study, we demonstrated that amplified FGFR2 and mutant
PIK3CA were linked to AKT phosphorylation in SUM185 cells, and that targeting either oncogene alone induced
potent inhibition of cell proliferation. However, this
growth inhibition was reversible as indicated by small
decreases in clonogenic capacity following drug removal
[44]. By contrast, simultaneous inhibition of FGFR2 and
BCL2L1, or PIK3CA and BCL2L1 in SUM-185 cells
resulted in dramatic reductions in clonogenic survival.
Interestingly, targeting BCL2L1 alone at concentrations
that inhibited cell proliferation had only marginal effects
on clonogenic capacity. This result suggests that AKT
activity can support cell survival in the presence of

BCL2L1 inhibition, and vice versa, but that simultaneous
inhibition of both oncogenes results in profound and
irreversible loss of proliferative capacity. Extending this
result to SUM-52 cells which do not harbor BCL2L1
amplification but in which BCL2L1 was a hit in the
shRNA screen, we found that we could induce synergistic
loss of clonogenic capacity by combining the FGFR
inhibitor with Navitoclax, but because BCL2L1 was
not part of the oncogene signature in these cells, higher
concentrations of drug were required to achieve a strong
effect. Finally, combined inhibition of BCL2L1 activity
and AKT phosphorylation did not result in synergistic
effects in either the SUM-190 or SUM-225 cell lines,
which is consistent with the failure of BCL2L1 to be a
hit in the shRNA screen in these cell lines. Synergistic
responses are therefore cell type-specific and depend on
the addiction of the breast cancer cells to the targeted
functional oncogenes.
Recently, Engelman et al. performed a genome-wide
screen to identify genes that, when inhibited, cooperate
with MEK inhibitors to kill KRAS mutant cancer cells
[52]. The top hit identified in this screen was BCL2L1.
Grant et al. [53] also observed potent synergy from
combining BCL2L1 inhibitors with inhibition of AKT in
leukemias and have suggested this as a strategy to treat
AML. Taken together, these results and ours provide
strong rationale for the development of combination
therapies that target BCL2L1 and AKT, particularly in
light of the observed synergy which allows for the use of
very low doses of the targeted drugs.
AKT is an important protein that regulates, among
other things, cell survival, and is considered a potential
therapeutic target. However, given the importance of
AKT activity in many cellular pathways, targeting AKT
directly is often associated with significant side effects.
Thus, it is preferable, from a therapeutic standpoint, to
inactivate AKT indirectly by targeting the oncogene
that is responsible for its activity. This approach will
allow cancer cell-specific inactivation of AKT, which is
vital to obtaining a high therapeutic index. Our results
demonstrate that functional oncogene signatures can
identify driver oncogenes that are responsible for driving
AKT signaling and in turn allow for rational targeting of
AKT through these drivers.
A personalized medicine approach for cancer
treatment holds the promise of treating patients with
highly effective targeted therapeutics that are tailored to
the genetic alterations that drive their cancer. Realizing
this promise will require accurate identification of the
complete set of oncogenes to which each patient’s cancer
cells are addicted. Understanding the complete set of
activated oncogenes that drive a patients’ tumor will allow
for rationally designed combination therapies that induce
profound decreases in clonogenic survival with minimal
effects on normal cells and tissues.

Reagents and cell lines
All inhibitors were purchased from Selleckchem.
The PathScan® (#5301) and Caspase-3(#9665) antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling. The SUM breast
cancer cell lines were maintained as described previously
[14, 54, 55]. MCF10A cells were a gift from Dr. Herb
Soule at the Michigan Cancer Foundation [56].

Array comparative genomic hybridization
Microarrays with an average resolution of 35 kb
(Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray 44k chip) were
hybridized after direct labeling of DNA with fluorescent
dyes. DNA extraction was performed using standard
column purification (Qiagen) and normal human female
DNA was used as the reference. Dye-reversed replicates
were performed. Regions of chromosomal amplification
and deletion were determined based on circular binary
segmentation provided by the Bioconductor DNA copy
library.

Genome-scale RNAi-based growth and viability
screen
Virus pools expressing shRNA constructs were
prepared according to the Cellecta Pooled Lentiviral
shRNA Libraries User Manual protocol (www.cellecta.
com). HEK 293T cells were transfected with each of
the three Cellecta library plasmid DNA pools (Human
Modules 1-3) and the Cellecta Ready-to-Use Packaging
Mix (Cat #CPCP-K2A). For each module, virus was
titered and used to transduce 5 × 10^7 target cells at
an MOI of ~.5 in the presence of 5ug/ml polybrene.
Following transduction, cells were cultured for 3 days
to allow expression of the resistance marker and nontransduced cells were eliminated from the culture by
addition of the selective agent puromycin to the growth
media at 6 ug/ml for SUM-52 cells or 2 ug/ml for SUM185, SUM-190, and SUM-225 cells. Three days after the
addition of puromycin, cells were trypsinized and one
half of the total population was harvested for genomic
DNA preparation. This DNA served as the reference time
point DNA. The remaining cells were plated and grown
for ~5–7 population doublings before harvesting for
genomic DNA preparation. Genomic DNA was prepared
by phenol:chloroform extraction according to the Cellecta
Pooled Lentiviral shRNA Libraries User Manual protocol.
Barcode sequences were amplified from genomic
DNA by two rounds of PCR. For first round PCR, 50–100
µg of genomic DNA was used for 4 × 100 µl PCR reactions.
Each 100 µl reaction contained 2 µl Titanium Taq polymerase
(Clontech Catalog #639210), 200 nM dNTP mix (Clontech

36149

Cat# 639210) and 10 µM of each primer (FWDHTS
5′-TTCTCTGGCAAGCAAAAGACGGCATA-3′
and
RevHTS1 5′-TAGCCAACGCATCGCACAAGCCA-3′).
First round PCR reactions began with activation of
the polymerase by incubation at 94°C for 3 minutes
followed by 16 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec,
annealing at 65°C for 10 sec, and elongation at 72°C for
20 sec. Final extension was performed by incubation
at 68°C for 2 minutes. First round PCR reactions were
pooled and 100 µl was used to seed a 4 × 100 µl second
round PCR reaction. Each 100 µl second round reaction
contained 2 µl Titanium Taq polymerase, 200 nM
dNTP mix and 10 µM of each primer (FWDGEX
5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGA-3′ and RevGEX
5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGA-3′). Second round
PCR reactions began with activation of the polymerase by
incubation at 94°C for 3 minutes followed by 12 to 16 cycles
of denaturat′ion at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 65°C for 10
sec, and elongation at 72°C for 10 sec. Final extension was
performed by incubation at 68°C for 2 minutes.
Amplified barcode sequences were run on a
3.5% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Isolated barcode sequences were further
purified using the PureLink Quick PCR Purification
Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
For sequencing, purified barcodes
were diluted to .75 ng/µl using buffer EB (Qiagen).
Amplicons were clustered at 17 pM including 30%
(v/v) PhiX to add sequence diversity. Single end (SE)
clustering was performed on a Cbot according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA). A
total of 36 cycles of SE sequencing were performed on
an Illumina HiScanSQ. Custom primer GexSeqS (5′
AGAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGAA-3′, HPLC
Purified) was added to the Illumina sequencing primers
at 0.5 µM. Fastq files were generated using CASAVA
1.8.2 and processed using Trimmomatic software (www.
usadellab.org) to trim read lengths to 18 nucleotides.
Trimmed reads were deconvoluted using Cellecta Barcode
Analyzer and Deconvoluter software. Fold depletion
scores for each shRNA were calculated as the ratio of the
read count at the reference time point versus the final time
point.
In the Cellecta shRNA library, the vast majority
of genes were targeted by either 5 (67%) or 6 different
shRNAs (32%), and a small fraction of genes (1%) were
targeted by 2 to 69 different shRNAs. The genes targeted
by large numbers of shRNAs were housekeeping genes
that would be expected to be hits in most, if not all, cell
lines tested. Luciferase, which was used as the nonsilencing control was also targeted by over 60 shRNAs
and helped to establish the range of scores for known
negative hits. Because of the varying numbers of shRNAs
per gene, simply ranking hits based on the 2nd highest
score or on a weighted average of the top two genes would
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have biased analysis towards genes with a larger number
of shRNAs per gene. To account for this potential bias,
log-transformed depletion scores and a quantile estimation
approach in which the 80th percentile for each gene was
calculated from its empirical distribution were used. This
avoided the bias induced by the varying number of scores
per gene and accounted for the skewness of the empirical
distributions. Genes were then ranked by this log-quantile
score and the empirical distribution of the log-quantile
score was calculated.
To generate a null distribution of log fold-depletion
scores, it was assumed that the majority of genes (> 95%)
would not be depleted, and their log-quantile scores would
have a normal distribution. Based on this assumption,
the median of the empirical distribution was used as an
estimate of the mean of the null distribution. The estimate
of the standard deviation of the null distribution was
defined as the 97.5th quantile minus the 2.5th quantile,
divided by 4. This was based on the knowledge that 95%
of the data in a normally distributed variable falls between
+/– two standard deviations from the mean. Using this null
distribution, all genes having log-fold depletion scores that
were larger than the 95th percentile of the null distribution
were identified as ‘hits’. Using this method, all genes that
were hits in the screen had at least two, and usually more,
shRNAs with depletion scores above the cut-point.

Exome sequencing
Exome sequencing of SUM cell line DNA was
performed essentially as described previously [57].
Briefly, Agilent Sure Select XT reagents were used
to prepare sequencing libraries. Hybrid capture was
performed using Agilent Sure SelectXT Human All
Exon V4+UTRs, and 100 bp paired-end sequencing was
performed on a HighSeq2000.

Small molecule inhibitor dose response assays
Cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of
15–30,000 cells per well. Cells were allowed to recover
for 4 days before being treated in triplicate with the
indicated inhibitors or DMSO control every 24 hours for
4 days. On the 5th day cell number was determined by
harvesting and counting nuclei on a Z1 Coulter Counter
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). To prepare nuclei
for counting, cells were washed three times with PBS,
incubated on a rocker table with 0.5 ml per well Hepes/
MgCl2 buffer (0.01 mM HEPES and 0.015 mM MgCl2)
for 5 minutes and lysed for 10 minutes with ethyl
hexadecyldimethylammonium solution.

Clonogenic survival assays
Cells were seeded at clonal density in triplicate
in 6-well plates and treated with the indicated small

At 72 hours cells were washed and cultured in normal
growth media until colony sizes reached ~50–100 cells.
For staining, colonies were fixed with 1 mL/well 3.7%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT. Colonies were
stained with 1 mL/well 0.2% crystal violet for 15 minutes
at RT and de-stained with dH2O. Colony counts were
