Abstract

Author Manuscript

Extracellular ATP has been shown to either inhibit or promote cancer growth and migration;
however the mechanism underlying this discrepancy remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the
divergent roles of ATP and adenosine released by bone osteocytes in breast cancers. We showed
that conditioned media (CM) collected from osteocytes treated with alendronate (AD), a
bisphosphonate drug, inhibited the migration of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells.
Removal of the extracellular ATP by apyrase in CM abolished this effect, suggesting the
involvement of ATP. ATP exerted its inhibitory effect through the activation of purinergic P2X
receptor signaling in breast cancer cells evidenced by the attenuation of the inhibition by an
antagonist, oxidized ATP, as well as knocking down P2X07 with siRNA, and the inhibition by an
agonist, BzATP. Intriguingly, ATP had a biphasic effect on breast cancer cell behavior–lower
dosage inhibited, but higher dosage promoted its migration. The stimulatory effect on migration
was blocked by an adenosine receptor antagonist, MRS1754, ARL67156, an ecto-ATPase
inhibitor, and A2A receptor siRNA, suggesting that in contrast to the action of ATP, adenosine, a
metabolic product of ATP, promoted migration of breast cancer cells. Consistently, nonhydrolyzable ATP, ATPγS, only inhibited, but did not promote cancer cell migration. ATP also
had a similar inhibitory effect on the Py8119 mouse mammary carcinoma cells; however,
adenosine had no effect due to the absence of the A2A receptor. Consistent with the results of
cancer cell migration, ATPγS inhibited, while adenosine promoted anchorage-independent growth
of breast cancer cells. Our in vivo xenograft study showed a significant delay of tumor growth
with the treatment of ATPγS. Moreover, the extent of bone metastasis in a mouse intratibial model
was significantly reduced with the treatment of ATPγS. Together, our results suggest the distinct

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Bone metastases are major, potentially fatal complications associated with advanced cancers
including breast cancer1,2,3,4. Bone tissues are preferred sites of cancer metastasis due to
their microenvironment, which provides a fertile setting in which tumor cells can grow5.
There are three major cell types in bone tissues: osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts.
Osteocytes comprise over 95% of total bone cells and play an essential role in orchestrating
the bone remodeling process by coordinating activities from the osteoclasts and
osteoblasts6,7. The roles of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bone metastasis have been linked
to the release of growth factors from the bone matrix, which stimulates tumor growth4.
However, the role of osteocytes, the most abundant cell type in bone tissue, in bone
metastases remains unexplored.

Bisphosphonate drugs are commonly used to treat skeletal complications such as bone pain,
pathological fracture, osteopenia and osteoporosis. This class of drugs is also used to treat
bone cancer metastasis and is associated with decreased tumor growth in addition to reduced
bone destruction and pain8. It has been reported that alendronate (AD), a bisphosphonate
drug, induces the opening of hemichannels, a channel permeable to small molecules (Mr < 1
kDa) in osteocytes9. In addition, osteocytes permit the release of ATP in response to
mechanical loading10. However, it is unknown whether the ATP molecules which are
released from osteocytes mediate the inhibitory effect of bisphosphonates on bone
metastasis.

Several studies have established the anti-neoplastic activity of extracellular ATP to inhibit
the growth of several cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer cells, colon
adenocarcinoma cells, melanoma cells, and bladder cancer cells11,12,13. Previous studies
point to the possibility that ATP, through its binding to P2 purinergic receptors, exhibits an
anti-cancer effect12. The activation of purinergic signaling is also reported to inhibit
proliferation and migration of human acute myeloblastic leukemia cells in immune-deficient
mice14. Additionally, in vivo studies show that daily injections of ATP significantly inhibit
tumor growth, prolong survival time and inhibit weight loss in mice15. However, the effect
of adenosine nucleotides on cancer bone metastasis is largely unexplored. Our study
demonstrates that ATP released from bone osteocytes exerts inhibitory effects on breast
cancer cells. ATPγS, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, has a similar inhibitory effect on
breast cancer cell migration. In contrast to the effect by ATP, adenosine, a metabolic
product, promoted human breast cancer cell migration, and this stimulatory effect was
attenuated with an adenosine receptor antagonist. Moreover, we showed the inhibitory effect
by ATP and the stimulatory effect by adenosine were primarily mediated by the activation

of P2X7 and A2A receptors, respectively. These results suggest that adenosine nucleotides
released from osteocytes and their activating signaling mechanisms have significant impacts
on the migration and growth of tumor cells and cancer metastasis to the bone.

RESULTS
ATP released by AD-treated osteocytes inhibits the migration of human breast cancer cells

To determine the underlying mechanism of the bisphosphonates in suppressing cancer
metastasis to the bone, we treated osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells with AD and collected CM. The
result from the transwell cell migration assay showed that CM collected from the MLO-Y4
osteocytes treated with AD significantly decreased the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells
(127±12 cells to 38±12 cells) (Figure 1A). To eliminate the possibility of any effects from
proliferation, the WST-1 cell proliferation assay was performed by incubating the MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells in the identical CM and time duration as used in the transwell
migration assay. The proliferation of the MDA-MB-231 cells incubated in CM from MLOY4 cells treated with 20 μM AD (CM-AD) was similar to that of the MDA-MB-231 cells
incubated in untreated CM (CM) (Figure 1B). To determine whether ATP released from
osteocytes would have an effect on MDA-MB-231 cell migration, we depleted ATP from
the CM collected from MLO-Y4 cells using apyrase, an ATP hydrolyzing enzyme. The
addition of apyrase increased MDA-MB-231 cell migration by 2.5 fold in untreated CM and
7.7 fold in CM-AD (Figure 1A). To exclude the possibility that AD might have direct effects
on MDA-MB-231 cells, we performed the transwell cell migration assay with the MDAMB-231 cells with AD added directly to the CM collected from MLO-Y4 cells. The results
showed that there was no difference in migration when incubated with AD (Figure 1C).
These results suggest that ATP released from osteocytes upon AD treatment can inhibit the
migration of human breast cancer cells.
To test the effect of purinergic signaling activated by ATP on breast cancer cell migration,
we treated the CM with oxidized ATP (oATP), a potent inhibitor of P2X purinergic
receptors. The addition of oATP significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of CM-AD on
MDA-MB-231 cell migration (Figure 2A). Consistently, the addition of BzATP, a
nonhydrolyzable P2X7 receptor agonist, caused a significant, dose-dependent decrease in
breast cancer migration (0 μM = 110±11.6 cells, 10 μM = 99±7.8 cells, 100 μM = 64±4.4
cells, 200 μM = 39±2.6) (Figure 2B). The result from the WST-1 assay showed that the
treatment with BzATP at concentrations 1–200 μM had minimal effects on cell proliferation,
and a significant reduction was only observed at 400 μM (Figure S1). These data support an
inhibitory role for P2X receptor activation in the migration of human breast cancer cells.

ATP inhibits, but adenosine promotes the migration of breast cancer cells
To determine the direct involvement of ATP, we applied ATP into the CM. Surprisingly, the
treatment of 200 μM ATP did not decrease, but increased the migration of MDA-MD-231
cells in both CM collected from AD and non-AD-treated MLO-Y4 cells (153±21.1 vs.
88±10.7 and 188±33.5 vs. 127±2, respectively) (Figure 3A). To further test the effect of
ATP, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with ATP at varying concentrations (Figure 3B). We
found that the inhibitory effect of ATP was only observed at lower concentration (0 μM =

150±4.8 cells vs 50 μM = 100±17.7 cells), but higher concentration instead promoted cancer
cell migration (200 μM = 257±26 cells, 400 μM = 240±0.9 cells). The effect of ATP on cell
migration was not caused by alterations of cell proliferation (Figure S2). This increase in
migration is possibly due to higher levels of adenosine formed as a product of the increased
break down of ATP at higher concentrations, since extracellular ATP is known to be readily
hydrolyzed to adenosine by a group of enzymes known as ectonucleotidases16. To test for
the possible effects of adenosine as a result of ATP hydrolysis, a potent adenosine receptor
antagonist, MRS1754 was used. As a selective adenosine receptor antagonist, MRS1754
specifically inhibits A2B receptors at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations,
MRS1754 is known to inhibit other P1 receptors (A1 and A2A). The addition of high
concentration (500 nM) of MRS1754 attenuated the stimulatory effect of ATP on the
migration (Figure 3A). Moreover, MRS1754 further augmented the inhibitory effect of CMAD on cell migration, suggesting these adverse effects were mediated by adenosine. To
verify the effects of MRS1754 by itself on MDA-MB-231 cell migration and to reveal the
specific P1 receptor(s) involved, we treated the media directly with a low concentration (2
nM) and high concentration (500 nM) of MRS1754 (Figure S3A). There was no significant
difference in migration with the low concentrations (A2B receptors blocked), but at high
concentrations (A1, A2A, and A2B receptors blocked), the migration was reduced by over 2.6
fold (Figure S3A). The cell viability was not affected by the different concentrations of
MRS1754 (Figure S3B). As further confirmation, we applied an ecto-ATPase inhibitor,
ARL67156, which prevents the breakdown of ATP. The addition of ARL67156 attenuated
the stimulatory effect of higher dosage of ATP on the migration of the breast cancer cells
(Figure 3C). The addition of ARL67156 to media also triggered a decrease in migration
(Figure S4A). However, the effect of ARL67156 on cell migration was not caused by
changes in cell proliferation (Figure S4B). To demonstrate the effect of ATP in the absence
of its break down, we used a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, ATPγS, which is a broad
agonist of P2 receptors. The application of this reagent to control CM significantly reduced
the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells (112±2.4 cells to 63±9.6 cells) (Figure 3D). The
significant reduction of cancer cell migration by ATPγS was further demonstrated in a dosedependent manner (0 μM = 69±3.8 cells, 50 μM = 46±9.3 cells, 100 μM = 33±3.3 cells, 200
μM = 11±1.7, 400 μM = 9±1.5 cells) (Figure 3E). These data confirm the inhibitory role of
ATP on breast cancer cell migration and imply the opposite role of adenosine.

Author Manuscript

We further tested the effect of adenosine on MDA-MB-231 cell migration. CM collected
from MLO-Y4 cells were treated with or without adenosine. MRS1754 was also added to
verify the specific effect from adenosine. The treatment of adenosine increased MDAMB-231 cell migration, whereas this increase was completely attenuated with the addition of
500 nM MRS1754 (Figure 4A). The enhanced cell migration by adenosine was not a result
of increased cell proliferation since the treatment of adenosine at various concentrations had
minimal effects on cell proliferation (Figure S5). These data indicated the possible
involvement of A1 and A2A receptors. To further determine if a similar effect was also
observed with the hydrolysis of ATP, we added apyrase to the CM. Consistently, the
increase of the migration as a result of apyrase treatment was significantly attenuated by
MRS1754 (Figure 4B). To ascertain the specific P1 receptor subtype which is stimulated by
adenosine to enhance breast cancer cell migration, we utilized a selective A2A receptor

antagonist, ANR94. The viability of MDA-MB-231 cells is unaffected by ANR94 up to
concentrations of 100 μM; therefore, we used this concentration in future experiments
(Figure S6). The blocking of A2A receptors by ANR94 dramatically decreased the migration
of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Based on these data, we concluded that adenosine has a
stimulatory role on breast cancer cell migration and this effect is likely mediated through the
adenosine A2A receptor. These results further suggest the divergent roles of ATP and
adenosine on breast cancer cell migration; the inhibitory role by ATP and the stimulatory
role by adenosine.

Author Manuscript

The levels of ATP and adenosine in the CM (MLO-Y4 cells treated with AD for 48 hr) were
measured by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). 10 μM or 20 μM AD
increase the ATP by 102.1±17.85 or 221.6±18.45 fold compared to the control CM,
respectively. Adenosine levels were also increased in the CM from MLO-Y4 cells treated
with 20 μM AD, to a lesser degree compared with ATP levels (4.8±0.1 fold compared to
control CM). This data further supports the notion that ATP released by osteocytes treated
with AD is responsible for the inhibitory effect on the breast cancer cells. On the other hand,
the lesser increase of adenosine possibility due to the hydrolysis of ATP in CM-AD failed to
exert a predominant effect on promoting breast cancer cells.
P2X7 mediates the migration-inhibiting effects from ATPγS, while A2A mediates the
migration-promoting effects from adenosine in MDA-MB-231 cells

Author Manuscript

We investigated the specific involvement of P2X7 in the ATP-induced inhibition of
migration as well as A2A receptors in adenosine-induced increase of migration by silencing
the expression of P2X7 and A2A using siRNA. We confirmed that mRNA expression of
P2X7 and A2A receptors were decreased by transfection with a P2X7 and A2A siRNA,
respectively (Figure 5A). In P2X7 knocked down cells, ATPγS failed to induce a decrease in
migration, whereas a dramatic decrease is seen with control siRNA transfected cells (Figure
5B). Additionally, adenosine failed to promote migration in A2A knocked down cells, while
control cells transfected with control siRNA exhibited significant increase in migration
(Figure 5C). These results indicate the specific involvement of P2X7 and A2A receptors in
ATP and adenosine-mediated migration effects, respectively.
ATPγS inhibits, but adenosine promotes anchorage-independent growth of human breast
cancer cells

Author Manuscript

To determine if ATP and adenosine have similar effects on the anchorage-independent
growth of human cancer cells, we cultured MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in soft agar
(Figure 6). Similar to their effects on the cell migration, ATPγS significantly inhibited
colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cells (82±4.5 colonies to 47 ± 6.2 colonies), while
adenosine had an opposite effect by significantly promoting colony formation (132 ± 13.7
colonies). These results suggest that ATP and adenosine not only affect cell migration, but
also have a major impact on human cancer cell growth.
ATP and ATPγS inhibited the migration of mouse mammary carcinoma cells

has been used as an in vivo metastatic model17. ATP at varying concentrations was added to
the CM collected from MLO-Y4 cells treated with (CM-AD) or without (CM) 20 μM AD.
The transwell cell migration assay was conducted with Py8119 cells incubated in these CM.
With the increase of dosage, the migration of the Py8119 cancer cells decreased, with the
most significant effect at 400 μM (254±25.9 cells to 159±7.8 cells with CM and 127±.3 cells
to 88±10.3 cells for CM-AD) (Figure 7A). The migration of Py8119 cells was also
decreased with the treatment of ATPγS (Figure 7B). These results suggest that similar to
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, ATP has an inhibitory role on Py8119 mouse mammary
carcinoma cells and further implies a broad role of ATP on breast cancer bone metastasis.
We then tested whether adenosine has a similar stimulatory effect on the Py8119 cells as it
had on the MDA-MB-231 cells. The transwell migration assay was conducted with Py8119
cells incubated in media containing various concentrations of adenosine (Figure 7C). We
found that the migration of Py8119 cells was not changed, regardless of the concentration of
adenosine added. Furthermore, Py8119 cell migration was unaffected by either low or high
concentrations of MRS1754 (Figure S3C). Blocking the specific A2A receptors with ANR94
treatment did not affect migration patterns either (Figure 7D). This indicates that unlike the
human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, the migration of the mouse mammary
carcinoma cell line Py8119 is not sensitive to adenosine.

Author Manuscript

The insensitivity of Py8119 cells to adenosine could be caused by the absence of certain
adenosine receptors. To investigate the specific purinergic receptor subtypes which are
expressed on MDA-MB-231 and Py8119 cells, we examined the mRNA expression of all P1
and several P2 receptors. We chose P2X5, P2X7, P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y11, as these are the
P2 receptor subtypes most implicated in cancer11,12. MDA-MB-231 cells express all P1
receptors but A3, as well as all 5 P2 receptors assessed (Figure S7). Py8119 cells express all
P1 receptors except A2A, as well as P2X5, P2X7, and P2Y2. Receptor P2Y11 was not
evaluated in Py8119 cells as there has not been a rodent ortholog of P2Y11 reported18.
These results suggest that the different response of Py8119 cells to adenosine stimulation
could be due to its lack of the A2A receptor since this receptor subtype as shown above is
responsible for the effect of adenosine on MDA-MB-231 cells.
ATPγS inhibited the tumor growth of human mammary carcinoma cells in nude mouse
xenografts

Author Manuscript

Our in vitro data demonstrated the inhibitory effect of ATP on breast cancer cell growth and
migration. To test if ATP has a similar, inhibitory effect on tumor growth in vivo, we used
an orthotopic mouse model. MDA-MB-231 cells were orthotopically implanted into the
mammary fat pads of athymic female nude mice. After the mice were randomly assigned
into 3 different treatment groups, the mice were treated with or without ATPγS or
adenosine. Dosages were determined by a previous study showing no toxicity from IP
injections of up to 50 mM of adenine nucleotides into mice for 10 days15. At the end of the
study, the tumors were excised and weighed. We found that the mice treated with ATPγS
exhibited significantly reduced tumor growth rate in comparison to the control group, while
the adenosine treated mice had an increase in tumor growth rate (Figure 8A). The reduced
mean tumor volume of the treatment group was statistically significant after 17 days of
ATPγS treatment. In post mortem analysis, the tumors excised from the mammary fat pads

showed significantly (over 4 fold) decreased sizes in the ATPγS-treated group as compared
to the control group. Additionally, the adenosine-treated group had 50% increased tumor
sizes compared to the control group tumors (Figure 8B). These results reveal that systemic
administration of ATPγS had an inhibitory effect on the growth of human breast cancer cells
in vivo.
ATPγS inhibited the tumor growth and metastasis of mouse mammary carcinoma cells in
vivo

Author Manuscript

To assess how systemic treatment with ATPγS may affect the growth of breast cancer cells
in the bone microenvironment of a syngeneic host, we performed intratibial injections in
wild-type C57bl/6 female mice using the mouse mammary carcinoma cell line Py8119. The
mammary tumor cells were injected into the right tibias of the female mice, and the tumor
growth was monitored with whole animal imaging once a week for 4 weeks.
Bioluminescence analysis of the animals revealed that treatment with ATPγS significantly
inhibited tumor growth in the tibias (Figure 9). Our results indicate that mice injected with
ATPγS had a dramatic reduction in tumor burden after 4 weeks of treatment as reflected by
bioluminescence signals from the images taken in both the dorsal (right panels) and ventral
(left panels) positions. Quantification data (lower panels) further confirmed the significant
decrease of tumor growth in bone with the treatment of ATPγS.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The growth and migration of tumor cells are largely influenced by their microenvironment,
and bone is one of the most preferred sites for cancer metastasis4. Osteocytes, the most
abundant bone cell type, are known to release several factors, including prostaglandin, nitric
oxide and ATP by mechanical stimulation19. Although osteocytes comprise over 95% of
total cells in the bone, their involvement in cancer bone metastasis is unknown. We
observed that CM collected from AD-treated osteocytes decreased numbers of breast cancer
cells migrating to the other side of the transwell membrane. This decrease is caused by a
reduction of cell migration but not a reduction of cell viability, as the WST-1 assay failed to
detect any alteration in cell number. Furthermore, direct treatment with AD did not result in
any change, indicating that the decrease in cell migration was not due to direct effects from
AD. The inhibitory effect is likely to be mediated by ATP since depletion of ATP by
apyrase or application of an antagonist of P2X receptors completely attenuated such effects.
Additionally, the use of a P2X7 agonist and P2X7 siRNA inhibited the migration. We would
expect that direct treatment with ATP could inhibit the migration. However, we observed a
biphasic effect of ATP on the migration of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells; low
concentration inhibited, but high concentrations promoted. Extracellular ATP can be
hydrolyzed by ectonucleotidases released from the cell16. We suspected that products of
ATP hydrolysis, such as adenosine, might exert an inverse effect from ATP on cancer cell
migration. Indeed, prevention of ATP hydrolysis by an ecto-ATPase inhibitor, ARL67156,
averted the stimulation of higher dosage of ATP on breast cancer cell migration. Moreover,
treatment with non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues, ATPγS or BzATP, significantly attenuated
this adverse effect. Additionally, ATPγS reduced MDA-MB-231 cell growth assessed by the
soft agar colony formation assay. Consistently, we showed that adenosine has an opposite

effect from ATP in promoting the growth and migration of human breast cancer cells. The
treatment of an adenosine receptor antagonist or A2A siRNA attenuated the stimulatory
effect of adenosine on cancer cells. Therefore, we have to be cautious when investigating the
involvement of ATP on tumorigenesis or other diseases since it could largely depend on the
stability of this molecule in the body.

Extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides have been shown to participate in signal
transduction through purinergic receptors and affect a variety of cellular functions and
processes such as inflammation, development and regeneration, and cancer20. Several
previous studies have shown the increased levels of adenosine nucleotides in the tumor
microenvironment. Adenosine concentrations increase under metabolically unfavorable
conditions, such as cancer. Studies have demonstrated higher levels of extracellular
adenosine in a solid tumor microenvironment compared to normal tissue (about two-fold
increase)21. The physiological ATP concentration in human blood is normally
submicromolar (20 – 100 nM), and it is estimated that the pericellular ATP concentration is
in the low nanomolar range. Based on one study, tumor cells generate a microenvironment
in which the ATP concentration is in the hundred micromolar range22. We quantified the
ATP and adenosine in our CM and discovered over a hundred fold increase in ATP levels
into the media from osteocyte release after AD treatment. The increased adenosine level was
much less dramatic, although it was several fold difference compared to untreated
osteocytes. The levels of ATP and adenosine released from the osteocytes into the CM are
comparable to what is found in the aforementioned studies. This suggests that adenosine
nucleotides may have a role in bone metastasis.

Author Manuscript

The main pathway leading to high adenosine levels is the hydrolysis of ATP by
ectonucleotidases, such as CD39 and CD73. CD73 catalyzes the conversion of AMP to
adenosine and has been associated with a pro-metastatic phenotype in breast cancer. CD73
is overexpressed in ER negative breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples23. Its
expression is upregulated in both primary tumors and lymph node metastases. Additionally,
knocking down CD73 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells leads to growth suppression and
inhibition of invasion and migration both in vivo and in vitro24. Furthermore, CD73
promotes the migration and invasion of both T47D and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as
confirmed with the use of overexpression and inhibition, revealing that adenosine increases
the mobility of T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells25. As an enzyme that produces adenosine,
CD73 is able to tightly regulate adenosine receptor interaction in many tissues. Therefore, it
is important to not exclude the possibility that the stimulatory effects that we observe in
breast cancer cell migration and invasion may be partly due to the ectonucleotidase control
of adenosine signaling.

Previous literature reported conflicting observations with regard to the roles of ATP and
purinergic receptors in tumorigenesis. In accordance with our study, published studies have
indicated biphasic effects of ATP on cancer cells. Multiple studies indicated that the action
of ATP on P2 purinergic receptors leads to an anticancer effect12. On the other hand, other
studies have shown that activation of P2 receptors in some breast cancer cell lines could
cause an increase in cell migration and invasion26. This discrepancy could possibly be due
to varying expression levels of P2 ATP receptors reported among different breast cancer

cells types or activation of P1 adenosine receptors due to the ATP hydrolyzation by
endonucleases. Additionally, there is increased expression of certain P2X receptors in breast
tissue undergoing malignant change compared to normal breast tissue12.

Author Manuscript

Consistent with our observation of human breast cancer cells, a similar stimulatory effect of
adenosine on cancer cell chemotaxis has been observed previously for A2058 melanoma
cells and this response was inhibited by adenosine receptor antagonists27. Bladder and
prostate carcinomas seem to be inhibited by the activation of the P1 adenosine receptors, and
anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic and pro-necrotic effects have been reported in several other
different cell types11,13. It has also been reported that human primary breast tumor tissues
express higher levels of P1 adenosine receptors than in matched normal breast tissues28.
However, none of the published reports uncovered the biphasic effects of ATP as a result of
its degradation and the adverse effect of adenosine in the same cancer cells. We found that
the treatment with adenosine promoted human breast cancer cell migration. To further
determine the specific roles of P2X7 and A2A receptors in influencing breast cancer cell
migration, we used an RNAi method to knock down the expression of P2X7 or A2A with
siRNA transfection. We found that the downregulation of P2X7 in MDA-MB-231 cells
resulted in no effect when a P2 receptor agonist, ATPγS, was added. Furthermore,
downregulation of A2A lead to no effect when a P1 receptor agonist, adenosine, was added.
These data indicate the specific roles of P2X7 and A2A receptors in the inhibition and
promotion of MDA-MB-231 cell migration, respectively.

We sought further confirmation of the role of ATP/adenosine in breast cancer cells by using
an additional mammary carcinoma cell line from mouse, Py8119. Intriguingly, in contrast to
the observation in MDA-MB-231 cells, Py8119 cell migration was inhibited by ATP, even
at high concentrations. Through further investigation, we found that this discrepancy is due
to the insensitivity of Py8119 cell migration to adenosine. MDA-MB-231 migration was
inhibited by P1 receptor antagonists, such as MRS1754 (blocks A1, A2A, and A2B) and
ANR94 (blocks A2A), whereas Py8119 cell migration was unaffected by treatment with
either pharmacologic antagonist. Consistent with this, assessment of the purinergic receptor
mRNA expression in both MDA-MB-231 and Py8119 cells revealed that Py8119 cells lack
A2A expression, suggesting a possible reason for the lack of response to adenosine. These
results suggest that A2A receptors could be the major purinergic receptor subtype involved
in mediating the effect of adenosine in promoting breast cancer migration. Further
investigation is warranted to determine the involvement of this receptor in other breast
cancer cells as well as during cancer progression and metastasis.

We used two in vivo models to demonstrate the differential effects of adenosine nucleotides
on breast cancer growth and bone metastasis. Firstly, we applied a breast cancer xenograft
model where MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were orthotopically injected into the
mammary fat pad of nude female mice. This method is often used to examine primary tumor
growth29. We chose this model to study the influence of adenosine nucleotides on breast
cancer cell growth. Consistent with our in vitro observation of the anchorage-independent
cell growth assay, human breast cancer cell growth was significantly attenuated with the
treatment of ATPγS, while adenosine inversely enhanced the tumor growth in situ. The
intracardiac metastasis model is often used to study the metastatic behavior of cancer cells

into different organs30. However, due to the difficulty of producing bone metastases using
the intracardiac injection metastasis model with breast cancer cells, we opted for the
intratibial injection method. Intratibial injections are often performed for the purpose of
studying the relationship of cancer cells and bone after a tumor has already metastasized to
bone29. We directly injected tumor cells into the bone marrow cavity of the tibia to study the
effects of ATPγS on the growth of mammary tumor cells in a bone microenvironment. Our
in vivo studies demonstrate that systemic administration of the nonhydrolyzable ATPγS had
an inhibitory effect on breast cancer growth and migration in both the human MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells as well as the mouse Py8119 mammary carcinoma cells.

Clinically, intravenous ATP has been safely trialed in patients with advanced lung cancer31.
In another randomized controlled trial, ATP infusions in patients with advanced non-small
cell lung cancer had significantly increase overall survival at 9.3 months for ATP-treated vs.
3.5 months for control-treated patients32. There was a particularly significant survival
benefit in the subgroup of patients with stage IIIB non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma, as
opposed to stage IV, suggesting that the treatment is more effective at earlier stages. In
another study, ATP treatment in 99 preterminal cancer patients (life expectancy <6 months)
increased the short-term (0–8 weeks) and long-term (0–6 months) survival33. Although the
exact mechanism of the patient response remains unclear, it is evident that ATP has
considerable effect on survival. Together, our results point to the differential roles of
adenosine nucleotides and purinergic receptors in breast cancer invasion and metastasis, and
imply the possibility of utilizing these purinergic receptors as potential targets in cancer
metastasis therapeutics.

Conditioned Media (CM) preparation

Author Manuscript

MLO-Y4 cells were seeded onto 150 mm dishes (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) and
incubated for 24 hr to allow attachment, after which media was removed and changed with
α-modified essential medium (α-MEM) without phenol red (Gibco) supplemented with
2.5% FBS and 2.5% bovine calf serum (BCS) (Hyclone). MLO-Y4 cells were incubated in
the absence or present of 20 μM AD in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 48 hr and the CM
was collected.
Cell proliferation assay

Author Manuscript

Cell proliferation was assessed using the WST-1 (Water Soluble Tetrazolium salts) assay
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). A single cell suspension was plated in 96-well plates at 2.0 ×
104 cells/well and allowed to attach to the plates at 37°C for 2 hr. The cells were then treated
with CM collected from MLO-Y4 cells treated with or without 20 μM AD for 18 hr. After
the treatment, cell viability was measured by adding 10 μl of Cell Proliferation Reagent
WST-1 to each well and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cell
proliferation was measured at an emission wavelength of 450 nm with a Synergy HT MultiMode Microplate Reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA).
Cell migration assay

Author Manuscript

Migration assays were performed in transwell membrane filter inserts in 24-well tissue
culture plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The transwell membrane filter inserts
contained 6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore size, 10-nm thick polycarbonate membranes. The
breast cancer cell lines were harvested and resuspended in CM from MLO-Y4 cells with or
without other compounds. Five-hundred microliter breast cancer cell suspensions were
added to the upper side of the inserts at a density of 10 × 104 cells/insert and 750 μl CM with
or without other compounds was added to the lower wells. Cells were incubated at 37°C for
18–20 hr. Cells that did not migrate through the filters were removed using cotton swabs,
and cells that migrated through the inserts were fixed and stained with Hema 3 Stat Pack
(Fisher Scientific). The number of migrated cells in 5 fields of view per insert was counted
under a light microscope at magnification 10X.
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection

Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with 90 nM of P2X7 siRNA, 60 nM of A2A siRNA, or
90 nM Silencer Negative Control siRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) using DharmaFECT 4
Transfection Reagent (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Decreased mRNA expression of P2X7 or A2a was confirmed at
48 hr after transfection.
RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from MDA-MB-231 and Py8119 cells using the GeneJet RNA
Purification kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). cDNA was synthesized by
incubating 11 μl RNA (50 ng/μl) with 1μl Random Primers (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA)
at 70°C for 10 min, transferred to ice for 3 min, and then was incubated with 4 μl of 5X First
Buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP mix, and 2μl of 0.1 M DTT

(Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). The reaction mix was incubated at 42°C for 5 min and then
was incubated with 1 μl Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
at 42°C for 1 hr. The reaction was terminated by incubating at 70°C for 15 min and then
with 1 μl RNase H (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37°C for 20 min. Primer
pairs for PCR were designed and verified by basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) to
detect specific P1 and P2 receptors (Table 1). Optimal annealing temperatures for each
primer pair was determined by testing PCR with genomic DNA using annealing
temperatures ranging from 55 to 64°C. PCR was performed using JumpStart Taq DNA
polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and PCR products were separated on 2%
agarose gels. Negative controls comprised of no template (water) to monitor for PCR
product contamination. Genomic DNA was used as the positive control.
Soft agar colony formation assay

Author Manuscript

For anchorage-independent cell growth, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in 0.4% agarose
with complete medium supplemented with either 100 μM ATPγS or 200 μM adenosine on
top of a 0.8% agarose base supplemented with complete medium. Cells were maintained for
about 2 weeks before staining with p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO). The pictures were taken by scanner and the numbers of colonies were counted.
Quantification of ATP and adenosine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS)

Author Manuscript

ATP and adenosine were measured from the CM directly after filtering through a_5,000
NMWL Ultrafree-MC filter unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA) containing adenosine-13C10,
15N5-triplosphate (ATP13C, 15N) as internal standard, modified from Zhang et al (2011)34.
LC-MS analysis was conducted on a Thermo Fisher Q Exactive mass spectrometer with online separation using a Thermo Fisher/Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC. HPLC conditions were:
Waters XTerra-MS C18 column (3.5 μm, 150 mm × 2.1 mm i.d.); mobile phase A, 5 mM
Hexylamine and 0.5% diethylamine in water, pH10; mobile phase B, 50% acetonitrile in
water; flow rate, 400 μL/min; gradient, 1% B to 20% B over 10 min and followed by 20% B
to 30% B over 10 min. Full scan mass spectra were acquired in the orbitrap using negative
ion detection over a range of m/z 300 – 800 at 70,000 resolution (m/z 300). Identification
was based on the metabolite accurate mass (± 5 ppm) and agreement with the HPLC
retention time of authentic standards. Quantification was made by integration of extracted
ion chromatograms of ATP and adenosine followed by comparison with the corresponding
standard curves.
Animals

Author Manuscript

Four-week-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan Sprague–Dawley, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
were used for the mammary fat pad injections. Four- to five-week old female C57bl/6 mice
were used for the intratibial injections. Animals were maintained under the care and
supervision of the Laboratory Animal Research facility at the University of Texas Health
Science Center, San Antonio, Texas. The animal protocol was approved and monitored by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

In vivo xenograft experiment

Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-231 cells were injected subcutaneously in the mammary fat pad of 4-week-old
female nu/nu athymic nude mice. Each mouse received bilateral subcutaneous inoculation in
both the left and right inguinal mammary fat pad areas with 100 μl of cell suspension
containing ~1 × 107 cells/ml in serum-free media. Animals were randomly assigned to 3
different groups, and solid tumors were allowed to form up to about 5 mm3 volume before
treatments began. ATPγS, at 400 μmol/500 μl saline, adenosine, at 400 μmol/500 μl saline,
or 500 μl of saline, were administered intraperitoneally (IP) three times a week for 3 weeks.
The growth of xenograft tumors was monitored twice a week and tumor size was measured
with a caliper in two dimensions. Tumor volumes were calculated with the equation V =
(L×W2) × 0.5 (mm3), where L is length and W is width of a tumor.
Intratibial injections

Author Manuscript

Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane and were also given buprenorpine-HCl (0.3 mg/ml) as
an analgesic. Intratibial injections were performed as described previously35. Py8119 cells
expressing Luc-GFP (1 × 105 in 20 μl of PBS) were inoculated into the bone marrow area of
right tibias through the pre-made hole by a Hamilton syringe fitted with a 30-gauge needle.
PBS was injected into the left tibias as control. ATPγS, at 400 μmol/500 μl saline or 500 μl
of saline, was administered IP twice a week for 5 weeks, beginning from day 1. Intratibial
tumor growth was monitored with bioluminescence imaging with a Xenogen IVIS-Spectrum
imaging system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA, USA) every week starting from 3 days after tumor
cell inoculation.
Bioluminescence imaging analysis

Author Manuscript

Mice were anesthetized and D-luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda, CA) was injected
IP at 75 mg/kg in PBS. Xenogen IVIS Spectrum Imaging system was used to acquire
bioluminescence images at 10 min after injection. Acquisition time was set at 60 sec at the
beginning and reduced later on in accordance with signal strength to avoid saturation.
Analysis was performed using LivingImage software (Xenogen) by measurement of photon
flux (measured in photons/sec/cm2/steradian) with a region of interest (ROI) drawn around
the bioluminescence signal to be measured. Tumor burden was taken by drawing an ROI
around the major bioluminescence signal from the hind limb.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Unless otherwise specified in the Figure Legends, the data are presented as the mean ±
S.E.M. of at least three determinations. Asterisks indicate the degree of significant
differences compared with the controls (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001). Oneway
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student Newman-Keuls test were used to compare
groups using GraphPad Prism 5.04 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).
