Abstract
Understanding the molecular basis and target of traditional medicine is critical for drug development.
Celastrol, derived from Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F. (“Thunder of God Vine”), a traditional Chinese medicine
plant, has been assigned anticancer activities, but its mechanism is not well understood. Here, we investigated
whether Celastrol could inhibit angiogenesis-mediated tumor growth and, if so, through what mechanism.
When given s.c. to mice bearing human prostate cancer (PC-3 cell) xenografts, Celastrol (2 mg/kg/d) significantly reduced the volume and the weight of solid tumors and decreased tumor angiogenesis. We found that
this agent inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–induced proliferation, migration, invasion, and
capillary-like structure formation by primary cultured human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) in
a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Celastrol abrogated VEGF-induced sprouting of the vessels from aortic rings and inhibited vascular formation in the Matrigel plug assay in vivo. To understand the molecular
mechanism of these activities, we next examined the signaling pathways in treated HUVECs and PC-3 tumor
cells. Celastrol suppressed the VEGF-induced activation of AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and
ribosomal protein S6 kinase (P70S6K). Additionally, we found that Celastrol inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and induced apoptosis, and these effects correlated with the extent of inhibition of AKT/
mTOR/P70S6K signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that Celastrol targets the AKT/mTOR/P70S6K
pathway, which leads to suppression of tumor growth and angiogenesis. Cancer Res; 70(5); 1951–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Traditional medicines provide highly fertile ground for
modern drug development, but first they must proceed along
a pathway of discovery, isolation, and mechanistic studies
before eventual deployment in the clinic (1). Celastrol, known
as a tripterine, is a functional ingredient that was originally
identified and extracted from traditional Chinese medicine
named Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F. (“Thunder of God
Vine”) and shows potential in treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders, such as arthritis (2, 3), lupus erythematosus (4), lateral sclerosis (5), and Alzheimer's disease (6). It
also potentiates apoptosis in numerous tumor cells through
inhibition of IκBα kinase (7, 8), proteasome (9), topoisomeAuthors' Affiliations: 1Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of

rase (10), heat shock protein (11–13), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR) expression (14).
Although Celastrol has already shown to be promising in
tumor prevention, direct targets remain elusive. Whether
Celastrol could modulate tumor angiogenesis has not been
validated yet.
It is estimated that >90% cancer deaths that occur are due
to angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of cancer to vital
organs. Angiogenesis is one of the key processes that mediate metastasis, in part through the interaction of human vascular endothelial cells with VEGF. Although antibodies
against VEGF (called avastin) have already been approved
for human use by Food and Drug Adminsitration (FDA), safer and more efficient inhibitors are still needed. VEGF mediates its signals through the interaction with three distinct
receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3. These receptors
mediate their signals through activation of various cell signaling intermediates, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The latter has become an extremely
important drug target in cancer therapy recently (15). The
mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase, stands in a central position on the crossroad of various signal pathways (Ras, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT, hypoxia-inducible factor-1,
NF-κB) toward mRNA, ribosome, protein synthesis, and
translation of significant molecules (16). Through activation of its downstream ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (S6K1)

and hyperphosphorylation of the 4E binding protein (4E-BP1),
mTOR is critical for cellular proliferation and growth in endothelial cells and various tumor cells (17, 18). Overactivation in
mTOR signaling is frequently associated with tumorigenesis,
angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis (15, 19, 20). In recent years, drugs known as mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin, and
the newly developed rapamycin analogues have shown promise in the ongoing and recently completed cancer trials of
treatments for hematologic malignancy and transplant rejection (21, 22). And temsirolimus (Torisel), an mTOR inhibitor, is
currently approved by FDA as clinical anticancer therapy. Discovering additional safe and affordable inhibitors of the mTOR
pathway is of great attraction. Here, we report that Celastrol
effectively inhibited tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth by
targeting the AKT/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies. A 50 mmol/L stock solution
of Celastrol (obtained from Cayman Chemicals) was prepared and frozen at −20°C in small aliquots until needed.
Bacteria-derived recombinant human VEGF (VEGF 165 )
was a gift from the experimental branch of NIH. Growth
factor–reduced Matrigel was purchased from BD Biosciences. The antibodies against β-actin were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibodies anti-AKT, antimTOR, anti-p70S6K1, anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP), phosphorylated-specific anti-AKT (Ser 473 ), antimTOR (Ser2448), anti-p70S6K1 (Thr421/Ser424), anti-p70S6K1
(Thr389), and anti-VEGFR2 (Tyr1175) were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology.
Cell lines and cell culture. Primary human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were kindly provided by Dr.
Xinli Wang (Cardiothoracic Surgery Division of Michael E.
DeBakey Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine).
HUVECs were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium
(ECGM) as described previously (23). Human prostate cancer
(PC-3) cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HUVECs and PC-3 cells were
cultured at 37°C under a humidified 95%:5% (v/v) mixture of
air and CO2.
Human prostate tumor xenograft mouse model. All the
mice used in this study were maintained in a laminar airflow
cabinet under specific pathogen-free condition in a
12-h light-dark cycle. Experiments and managements were
followed in accordance with Texas A&M University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines at M.D.
Anderson; Animal Care and Use Committee typically approves animal protocols. Xenograft human prostate mouse
model was constructed as previously described (24). Sixweek-old male BALB/cA nude mice (National Rodent Laboratory Animal Resources, Shanghai Branch) weighing ∼28 g
were randomly divided into two groups of five each. PC-3
prostate cancer cells were s.c. injected into the mice (5 × 106
per mouse). After tumors grew to ∼130 mm3, the mice were
then s.c. treated with or without Celastrol (2 mg/kg/d). The
body weight of each mouse was recorded, and tumor volume

was determined by Vernier caliper everyday, following the formula of A × B2 × 0.52, wherein A is the longest diameter of tumor and B is the shortest diameter. After 16 d, the mice were
killed and solid tumors were removed.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Solid tumors were
fixed with 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. To
identify infiltrating blood vessels, immunohistochemistry
was carried out on 5-μm deparaffinized sections using a specific blood vessel staining kit (von Willebrand Factor; Millipore). Images of the stained blood vessels were taken using a
Leica DM 4000B photo microscope (magnification, ×200).
The Image-Pro plus 6.0 software package (Media Cybernetics,
Inc.) was used to determine the mean absorbance of blood
vessel staining.
Wound-healing migration assay. Wound-healing migration assay was performed as described previously (25). Briefly, HUVECs were starved to inactivate cell proliferation and
then wounded by pipette tips. ECGM containing 0.5% FBS
was added with or without 10 ng/mL VEGF and different dilutions of Celastrol. Images of the cells were taken after ∼8 to
10 h of incubation. Migrated cells were quantified manually,
and percentage inhibition was expressed using untreated
wells at 100%. Three independent experiments were performed.
Transwell migration assay. Transwell migration assay
was performed as described previously (25). Briefly, HUVECs
(2 × 104 per Transwell) along with the indicated concentrations of Celastrol were seeded into the upper chambers. The
bottom chambers were filled with 500 μL ECGM supplemented with 10 ng/mL VEGF. After 8 to 10 h of incubation, migrated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
stained with 1% crystal violet. Images were taken using an
Olympus inverted microscope (magnification, ×100). The percentage inhibition of migrated cells in treated groups was recorded.
Capillary-like tube formation assay. Tube formation was
assessed as described previously (25). Briefly, HUVECs were
pretreated with various dilutions of Celastrol for 30 min and
then seeded onto the Matrigel layer in 24-well plates at a
density of 4 to 7 × 104 cells. ECGM was with or without 10
ng/mL VEGF. After 6 h, tubular structure of endothelial cells
was photographed using an inverted microscope (Olympus;
magnification, ×100). Three independent experiments were
performed.
Cell viability assay. HUVECs or PC-3 cells (5–7 × 103 per
well) were treated with or without VEGF (10 ng/mL) and Celastrol for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by MTS (inner
salt) method, as described previously (24, 25).
Rat aortic ring assay. Rat aortic ring assay was performed
as described previously (26). In brief, aortas isolated from
Sprague-Dawley rats (NIH) were cleaned of periadventitial
fat and cut into rings at 1 to 1.5 mm in circumference. The
aortic rings were randomized into Matrigel-coated wells and
sealed with a 100-μL overlay of Matrigel. VEGF, with or without different dilutions of Celastrol, was added to the wells. As
a control, medium alone was assayed. After 6 d, we fixed the
microvessel sprouting and photographed it using an Olympus inverted microscope (Olympus; magnification, × 100).

Celastrol Inhibits Tumor Angiogenesis

The assay was scored from 0 (least positive) to 5 (most positive) in a double-blinded manner. Two independent experiments were performed.
Matrigel plug assay. Matrigel plug assay was performed as
described previously (26). Briefly, we s.c. injected 0.5 mL of
Matrigel containing 100 ng VEGF and 20 units of heparin with
or without 10 μg of Celastrol into the ventral area of C57/BL/6
mice (NIH). Five mice were used for each group. After 6 d, the
mice were killed and intact Matrigel plugs with different
treatments were removed. H&E staining was performed to
identify the formation and infiltration of new microvessels.
Functional microvessels with intact RBC were quantified
manually using a microscope (magnification, ×200).

Western immunoblot analysis. To determine the effects
of Celastrol on the VEGFR2-dependent mTOR signaling pathway, HUVECs were first starved in serum-free ECGM for 6
h and then pretreated with or without Celastrol for 30 min,
followed by stimulation with 50 ng/mL of VEGF for 2 min (for
VEGFR2 activation) or 15 to 20 min (for mTOR pathway kinase activation). To examine the mTOR pathway in prostate
tumor cells, normal cultured PC-3 cells were directly treated
with indicated dilutions of Celastrol for 4 h. The whole-cell extracts were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mmol/L Tris, 2.5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1%
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 40 mmol/L NaF, 10 mmol/L Na4P2O7,
and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented

of cellular protein of each sample were applied to immunoblot
using 6% to 12% SDS-polycrylamide gel and probed with specific antibodies. The intensity of immunoreactivity was measured using densitometer and Image J software (Version
1.34e; NIH).

Results
The goal of this study was to investigate whether Celastrol,
a triterpene from traditional Chinese medicine, can suppress
angiogenesis and, if so, through what mechanism. For this,
we used a wide variety of in vitro and in vivo assays. These
included tumor angiogenesis in vivo, cell proliferation, inva-

sion, and migration of VEGF-induced endothelial cells in vitro,
VEGF microvessel tubule formation, VEGF-induced microvessel sprouting, and VEGF-induced blood vessel formation
ex vivo. We also investigated the effect of Celastrol on VEGFinduced cell signaling pathways and on the survival of prostate
cancer cells.
Celastrol inhibits tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis
in a xenograft mouse model. To investigate the effect of Celastrol on tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in vivo, we
applied different concentrations of Celastrol in a prostate tumor (PC-3) xenograft model. We found that administration of
2 mg/kg/d Celastrol for 16 days substantially suppressed tumor volume (Fig. 1A) and reduced tumor weight (Fig. 1B).
The average tumor volume in the control mice increased from
130.63 ± 37.62 to 330.74 ± 72.20 mm3 after 16 days, whereas the
average tumor volume in the Celastrol-treated mice decreased
from 129.36 ± 37.35 to 35.49 ± 9.71 mm3. Additionally, the average tumor weight in the control group was 110.16 ± 47.73 mg,
whereas the average tumor weight in Celastrol-treated group

was only 9.46 ± 8.46 mg (Fig. 1B), a significant inhibition in tumor growth. However, the same dose of Celastrol had no significant effect on the body weight of mice (Fig. 1C), suggesting
low toxicity of Celastrol at the test dosage and conditions. A
lower dose of Celastrol (0.5 mg/kg/d) had little effect on the
tumor growth (data not shown).
To investigate whether Celastrol inhibited tumor growth
through the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, we used a
blood vessel staining kit to stain solid tumor sections in
the xenograft mouse model. We found that the mean absorbance of blood vessels in Celastrol-treated group was 29.96 ±
15.29/HPF compared with 100 ± 17.87/HPF in the control
group (Fig. 1D), indicating that Celastrol significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis.
Celastrol inhibits VEGF-induced chemotactic migration,
capillary structure formation, and viability of HUVECs
in vitro. To assess the antiangiogenic property of Celastrol
in vitro, we examined its inhibitory effects on the chemotactic
motility of endothelial cells using the wound-healing migration assay and Transwell assay, respectively. We showed that
Celastrol at 1 μmol/L significantly inhibited VEGF-induced
HUVEC migration in the wound-healing migration assay
(Fig. 2A). Using the Transwell assays, we further showed that
Celasrol dramatically reduced cell invasion (Fig. 2B). Both
effects were dose dependent, with significant inhibition
first occurring at ∼1 μmol/L of Celastrol.
To further determine the effect of Celastrol on angiogenesis, we examined how Celastrol regulates capillary tubule formation of HUVECs. When HUVECs were seeded on

growth factor–reduced two-dimensional Matrigel, robust tubular-like structures were formed in the presence of VEGF.
However, treatment with 1 or 2 μmol/L Celastrol abolished
the VEGF-induced tubule formation of HUVECs (Fig. 2C),
suggesting the potential effect of Celastrol on angiogenesis.
Angiogenesis requires the proliferation of endothelial cells.
We next examined whether Celastrol modulates VEGFinduced proliferation of endothelial cells by the MTS assay.
As shown in Fig. 2D, 1 μmol/L Celastol significantly decreased the VEGF-induced proliferation of HUVEC (Fig. 2D).
Together, these results indicated that Celastrol could block
VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro by inhibiting cell motility, cell proliferation, and endothelial cell tubular structure
formation.
Celastrol inhibits VEGF-induced microvessel sprouting
ex vivo. To study whether Celastrol affects VEGF-induced
angiogenesis ex vivo, we examined the sprouting of vessels
from aortic rings in the presence or absence of Celastrol.
VEGF (20 ng/mL) significantly stimulated microvessel
sprouting, leading to the formation of a network of vessels
around the aortic rings (Fig. 3A). Addition of different concentrations of Celastrol antagonized the VEGF-induced
sprouting in a dose-dependent manner, and 2 μmol/L Celastrol completely blocked microvessel sprouting (Fig. 3B).
Celastrol inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo.
Matrigel plug assay has been used to evaluate the effects of
Celastrol on VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo. As shown in
Fig. 4A, Matrigel plugs containing VEGF alone appeared dark
(Fig. 4A) and were filled with intact RBC, indicating that

functional vasculatures had formed inside the Matrigel via
angiogenesis triggered by VEGF. In contrast, addition of different concentrations of Celastrol dramatically inhibited vascular formation. As a result, the color of the Matrigel plugs
of Celastrol-treated group became much lighter (Fig. 4A).
H&E staining of the functional vasculature in Matrigel
plugs (Fig. 4B) showed that Celastrol at a dose of 10 μg dramatically blocked VEGF-induced vasculature formation
in vivo (Fig. 4C).
Celastrol inhibits the activation of AKT/mTOR/P70S6K
pathway in endothelial cells. Interaction of VEGFR2 with
VEGF led to the activation of various downstream signaling
molecules responsible for endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and survival. To further delineate the mechanism that
underlies the antiangiogenic effect of Celastrol, we examined
the signaling molecules and pathways using Western blotting
assays. As shown in Fig. 5A, the phosphorylation of VEGFR2
was suppressed by Celastrol in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 5A). Thus the antiangiogenic property of Celastrol
may be at least partially due to VEGR2 inhibition.
When examined for the key pathway components that regulate the endothelial cell function in angiogenesis, we found
that Celastrol effectively suppressed VEGF-triggered activation of mTOR signaling cascade, including AKT, mTOR,
and S6K kinase in HUVECs in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 5B), suggesting that Celastrol inhibit tumor angiogenesis through blocking of the mTOR signaling pathway.

Celastrol induces cell apoptosis and inhibits AKT/
mTOR/P70S6K pathway in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. As
shown in our xenograft prostate cancer model, tumor growth
was strongly suppressed by Celastrol administration, suggesting Celastrol also have direct cytotoxic effects on cancer
cells besides its antiangiogenic effect on endothelial cells. To
test this hypothesis, we examined tumor cell viability and the
potential signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells. Our results show that Celastrol significantly decreased PC-3 cell viability (Fig. 6A) and induced tumor cell apoptosis by
detecting full-length PARP1 (116 kDa) and its large cleavage
fragment (89 kDa; Fig. 6B). Furthermore, Celastrol also inhibited the activation of AKT, mTOR, and P70S6K in a concentration-dependent manner in normal cultured PC-3 cancer
cells (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the mTOR pathway is also a
possible target of Celastrol in tumor cells.

Discussion
In the present report, we have shown that Celastrol, a
component of traditional Chinese medicine, can inhibit the
growth of human prostate cancer in a xenotransplant mouse
model. One of the major mechanisms by which Celastrol
mediates its effects against prostate cancer seems to be
through suppression of angiogenesis. We found that Celastrol targeted AKT/mTOR/P70S6K (S6K1) signaling pathway
in a relatively specific manner both in endothelial cells and

in prostate tumor cells. Celastrol effectively inhibited microvessel sprouting ex vivo and angiogenesis in vivo. Once angiogenesis was blocked by Celastrol, tumor growth was
substantially suppressed.
Previous studies have shown that Celastrol suppresses
the growth of human tumors in nude mouse models. Yang
and colleagues showed that Celastrol could inhibit the
growth of human prostate cancer through suppression of
proteasomal pathway (9). Zhang and colleagues, however,
showed the inhibition of human pancreatic cancer growth
and metastasis by Celastrol through the suppression of heat
shock protein Hsp90 (12). These studies differ from that of
Huang's group, which showed the suppression of human
gliomas by Celastrol through the downregulation of expression of mRNA and protein for VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 (14).
The effect on VEGFR2 is in agreement with our studies,
as shown in Fig. 5A, that Celastrol inhibits VEGFR2 activation in endothelial cells. However, in the present study, we
further found that triterpenoid mediates antitumor effects
through suppression of both angiogenesis and tumor
growth. Additionally, our results suggested that VEGF receptor is not the principle target of Celastrol in suppression
of tumor angogenesis and tumor growth, because PC-3
prostate cancer cells express little Flt-1 (VEGFR1) and
KDR (VEGFR2), as reported previously (27).

Importantly, our study is the first to show the effect of
Celastrol on AKT/mTOR/S6K pathway. We showed Celastrol similarly and consistently reduces signaling from AKT
pS473 in a relatively specific manner in both prostate tumor cells and endothelial cells, which suggests the possibility that Celastrol is competing directly with TORC2 (the
mTOR-rictor complex that phosphorylates Akt at Ser473).
Other potential targets of Celastrol include HSP90-cdc
(28), topoisomerase II (10), Kir 2.1 and hERG potassium
channels (29), downregulation of expression of adhesion
molecules (30), and suppression of transforming growth
factor-b1 expression (31). A contribution of these targets
to the antitumor effects of Celastrol cannot be ruled out
in our studies. Additionally, we have shown that Celastrol
is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation (8). The latter is
known to regulate the expression of antiapoptotic and angiogenic gene products. Thus, the suppression of AKT/
mTOR/S6K pathway may also contribute to the antitumor
effects of the tripterine. Probably, all the above mechanisms might lead to synergic effect on angiogenesis in vitro
and ex vivo.
Dysregulation of mTOR signaling frequently leads to tumorigenesis (16, 19, 32). mTOR inhibitors are currently
being applied to malignant tumors in clinical trials (33),
suggesting that agents targeting mTOR signaling are

several studies have shown the role of p70S6K1, a direct
downstream target of the mTORC1 (mTOR, GβL, and raptor),
in modulating cell migration (34, 35). Phosphorylation of
p70S6K1 is sufficient to induce actin filament remodeling,
form lamellipodia and filopodia structures, and decrease actin stress fibers (36). In accord with this evidence, our results
in the VEGF stimulation models in vitro showed that Celastrol
at lower concentration of 1 μmol/L could effectively inhibit
endothelial cell migration, invasion, and capillary structure
formation.
In conclusion, our results have shown that Celastrol can
suppress tumor growth through inhibition of tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo via targeting AKT/mTOR/S6K
kinase signaling pathway. Our discovery of this novel mechanism of Celastrol in anticancer actions not only confirms
its ethnopharmacologic value but also contributes to modern
drug developments.
