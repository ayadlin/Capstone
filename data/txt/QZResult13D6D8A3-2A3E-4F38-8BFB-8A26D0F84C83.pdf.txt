ABSTRACT:
Cancer cells expressing constitutively active phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)
are proliferative regardless of the absence of insulin, and they form dietary restriction
(DR)-resistant tumors in vivo. Because the binding of insulin to its receptors
activates the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade,
activating mutations in the PIK3CA oncogene may determine tumor response to DRlike pharmacological strategies targeting the insulin and mTOR pathways. The antidiabetic drug metformin is a stereotypical DR mimetic that exerts its anti-cancer
activity through a dual mechanism involving insulin-related (systemic) and mTORrelated (cell-autonomous) effects. However, it remains unclear whether PIK3CAactivating mutations might preclude the anti-cancer activity of metformin in vivo. To
model the oncogenic PIK3CA-driven early stages of cancer, we used the clonal breast
cancer cell line MCF10DCIS.com, which harbors the gain-of-function H1047R hot-spot
mutation in the catalytic domain of the PI3KCA gene and has been shown to form
DR-refractory xenotumors. To model PIK3CA-activating mutations in late stages of
cancer, we took advantage of the isogenic conversion of a PIK3CA-wild-type tumor
into a PIK3CA H1047R-mutated tumor using the highly metastatic colorectal cancer

cell line SW48. MCF10DCIS.com xenotumors, although only modestly affected by
treatment with oral metformin (approximately 40% tumor growth inhibition), were
highly sensitive to the intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of metformin, the anticancer activity of which increased in a time-dependent manner and reached >80%
tumor growth inhibition by the end of the treatment. Metformin treatment via the i.p.
route significantly reduced the proliferation factor mitotic activity index (MAI) and
decreased tumor cellularity in MCF10DCIS.com cancer tissues. Whereas SW48-wildtype (PIK3CA+/+) cells rapidly formed metformin-refractory xenotumors in mice,
ad libitum access to water containing metformin significantly reduced the growth
of SW48-mutated (PIK3CAH1047R/+) xenotumors by approximately 50%. Thus,
metformin can no longer be considered as a bona fide DR mimetic, at least in terms of
anti-cancer activity, because tumors harboring the insulin-unresponsive, DR-resistant,
PIK3CA-activating mutation H1047R remain sensitive to the anti-tumoral effects of
the drug. Given the high prevalence of PIK3CA mutations in human carcinomas and
the emerging role of PIK3CA mutation status in the treatment selection process, these
findings might have a significant impact on the design of future trials evaluating the
potential of combining metformin with targeted therapy.

INTRODUCTION

consequent hyperinsulinemia can promote carcinogenesis
directly through the insulin receptor or indirectly by
increasing the levels of insulin-like growth factors or
promoting persistently elevated plasma glucose, the
association between metformin consumption and the
reduced risk of cancer among type 2 diabetic patients
may be explained simply by the metformin-driven
improvement of insulin levels and blood glucose [1922]. Indeed, the serum insulin- and IGF-1-lowering
effects of metformin have been thought to explain why
the administration of metformin suppresses tumor
development or growth in multiple experimental models,
including colon, hematopoietic, and mammary cancer
models. However, decreases in hyperglycemia and
hyperinsulinemia are not always correlated with the
anti-cancer efficacy of metformin, as can be observed
in non-diabetic mouse models. Thus, the anti-tumoral
action of metformin is not precluded in PTEN+/- [23, 24],
HER2 [25, 26], and APCmin/+ [27] mouse tumor models,
in which insulin-related markers are not significantly
attenuated by treatment with metformin. The notion that
metformin suppresses cancer growth through pathways
other than insulin/IGF-1-dependent, indirect drug
action has recently been supported by experiments in
liver IGF-1-deficient (LID) mice, which had naturally
decreased lung tumor multiplicity and burden compared
with wild-type mice [28, 29]. In this model, metformin
further decreased tobacco carcinogen (NNK)-induced
lung tumorigenesis without affecting IGF-1 levels. The
authors demonstrated that metformin can act through IGF1-independent mechanisms by promoting the systemic
inhibition of circulating growth factors and local receptor
tyrosine kinase signaling in cancer tissues [28]. Although
these findings suggest an insulin-independent, direct
anti-tumoral activity for metformin, it remains unknown
whether cancer cell-autonomous alterations that are known
to drive insulin/IGF-1-independent, DR-resistant tumors

The most hotly debated and yet unresolved
issue in the area of employing calorie restriction (CR)
mimetics (CRMs) as anti-cancer agents with mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR)-inhibiting activity is the
relative effects of nature versus nurture, i.e., the relative
contributions of systemic factors versus cancer cellautonomous effects [1-3]. The comparison of energybalance regimens, such as CR, and pharmacological
interventions with well-established mTOR inhibitors has
revealed that rapamycin conspicuously mimics CR in its
ability to decrease the mammary tumor burden in obese
animals [4-6]. However, constitutively active mTOR has
been found to fully ablate the beneficial effects of CR
on mammary tumor growth [7]. Similarly, tumors with
constitutively active phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)
have been found to be refractory to the anti-cancer activity
of dietary restriction (DR) [8, 9]. Because the binding of
insulin to its receptors activates the PI3K/AKT pathway,
which is known to stimulate mTOR activity, Kalaany
and Sabatini’s observations that tumor cells bearing
constitutively activated PI3K mutations are proliferative
in vitro in the absence of insulin or IGF-1 and form DRresistant tumors in vivo [8] clearly suggest that cancer
cell-autonomous alterations (e.g., activating mutations of
PI3K) may ultimately determine the response of cancer
cells to CR, DR, or CRMs.
One mTOR-inhibiting drug with great promise as
an anti-cancer CRM is metformin [10-16], a biguanide
drug that is commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes.
Epidemiological studies have consistently suggested
that type 2 diabetic patients treated with metformin have
a lower risk of developing and dying from cancer than
do diabetic patients receiving sulfonylurea, insulin, or
other therapies [17, 18]. Because insulin resistance and

We recently proposed that CR/DR-unresponsive
tumors with activating mutations in the PIK3CA oncogene
should be monitored for their responsiveness to clinically
relevant concentrations of metformin. We now present
evidence that human cancer xenotumors harboring
the insulin-unresponsive PIK3CA-activating mutation
H1047R remain sensitive to metformin. Our data confirm
that metformin cannot be considered a bona fide CRM,
at least in terms of its anti-cancer activity. Given the
high number of PIK3CA mutations in human cancer, this
finding could have a significant impact on the design of
metformin-based therapies that aim to influence both
the early stages of tumor formation and progression and
cancer recurrence in advanced tumors.

weeks of treatment with oral metformin exhibited slightly
decelerated tumor growth, with a final mean tumor
volume of 1186±293 mm3 (Fig. 1A). However, none of
the differences between the untreated controls and the
oral metformin-treated xenotumors over time reached
statistical significance. This finding was better reflected
by the percent MCF10DCIS.com tumor growth inhibition,
which was calculated as follows: 1-treated/control volume
ratio (1-T/C). The inhibitory effect of oral metformin was
modest, reaching a maximum of 43% at 4 weeks after cell
inoculation and decreasing toward the end of the treatment
(approximately 30-35%).

com xenotumors and found that i.p. metformin was highly
effective. Compared with the mean xenograft tumor
volume (approximately 1800 mm3) in the untreated control
animals, daily i.p. treatment with metformin resulted in
a dramatic reduction in mean tumor volume to 280±171
mm3 (Fig. 1A). Notably, the anti-tumor activity of i.p.
metformin at only 7 days after cell inoculation (49%) was
already greater than the maximum activity achieved at
any time with oral metformin. Moreover, the inhibitory
effect of i.p metformin increased in a time-dependent
manner, reaching a maximum of 84% at 42 days after cell
inoculation.

com cancer tissues. We analyzed MCF10DCIS.com tumor
xenografts to investigate the potential proapoptotic and/
or anti-proliferative effects of metformin; these effects
may have played a role in the overall anti-tumor efficacy
of the drug. No significant differences were observed in
the number of apoptotic cells between control tumors
and the tumors from the two therapeutic regimens (i.e.,
mice treated with oral metformin and mice treated with
i.p. metformin). We then compared the mitotic counts in
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained paraffin-embedded
sections according to the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson
histoprognostic grading system, as modified by Elston and
Ellis (Fig. 1B). For the first protocol, microscopic analysis
of the H&E staining of MCF10DCIS.com tumors showed
a moderate decrease (21%) in average mitotic counts
in the oral metformin group (26±8) compared with the
untreated control (33±1), but this difference did not reach
statistical significance (p=0.5). For the second protocol,
however, the quantification of average mitotic counts
revealed a statistically significant (p=0.01) 42% decrease
in the mitotic activity index in the i.p. metformin group
(19±1) compared with the control group.

MCF10DCIS.com xenotumors are highly sensitive to
intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered metformin. To model
the oncogenic PIK3CA-driven early stages of human
cancer, we employed the clonal breast cancer cell line
MCF10DCIS.com, which was derived from a xenograft
originating from premalignant MCF10AT cells that were
injected into SCID mice. The MCF10DCIS.com cell line
has been shown to have a missense mutation, H1047R, in
the kinase domain of PI3K. This gain-of-function mutation
is one of the “hot-spot” mutations in the catalytic domain
p110α of the PI3KCA gene, and it generates the most
potently oncogenic PI3K that is found with high frequency
in various cancers. More importantly for this study,
MCF10DCIS.com cells have been shown to proliferate
regardless of the presence or absence of insulin in vitro
and form tumors that are refractory to DR in vivo [8].
Two different metformin treatment protocols were
tested (n=5 mice per group). In the first protocol, mice
were exposed to control (water) or metformin (250 mg
kg-1) ad libitum 1 week prior to tumor cell inoculation.
The water was changed twice weekly and provided
continuously for a total of 56 days. In the second protocol,
metformin was administered by i.p. injection, and mice
were treated daily with 200 mg kg-1 metformin beginning
1 week before cell inoculation. This i.p. schedule with
metformin was continued for a total of 56 days. Metformin
was well tolerated in both treatment regimens, and it did
not significantly affect the weight (Supplementary Fig. 1)
or the diet consumption profiles (data not shown) of the
mice throughout the course of treatment.

pleomorphism, and abundant central necrosis (i.e., Grade
3 invasive ductal carcinomas; Fig. 1C, panels a and a’).
Anatomopathological examination of MCF10DCIS.com
breast xenotumors in animals treated with oral metformin
revealed that the cancer tissues remained poorly
differentiated, despite visual evidence of a reduction in
tumor size (Fig. 1C, panels b and b’). Interestingly, in the
very small MCF10DCIS.com tumors that developed in
the presence of daily i.p. metformin, a significant trend
of decreasing cellularity, accompanied by an increase in
the amount of extracellular connective tissue matrix, was
observed (Fig. 1C, panels c and c’).
Insulin-independent growth of PIK3CA H1047Rmutated tumor cells is inhibited by metformin in vitro.
Because the constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway
drives MCF10DCIS.com cells to form DR-resistant
tumors in vivo and to grow in an insulin-independent
manner in vitro, we determined whether exogenous

supplementation with metformin significantly affects
tumor cell unresponsiveness to insulin in vitro. DRresistant MCF10DCIS.com cells grew similarly in
culture in an insulin-independent fashion, i.e., insulin
failed to cause a dose-dependent increase in cell number.
Metformin did not act as an insulin sensitizer for insulinresistant PIK3CA H1047R-mutated MCF10DCIS.com
cells; rather, it acted as a growth inhibitor in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2).
Isogenic conversion of a PIK3CA-wild-type
tumor into a PIK3CA H1047R-mutated tumor promotes
sensitization to the anti-cancer effects of metformin. To
model PIK3CA-activating mutations in the late stages
of human cancer, we used two types of cancer cells
derived from the highly metastatic SW48 colorectal
cancer cell line. These cell lines were isogenic, except
that one line (SW48-WT) carries a wild-type allele
of the PIK3CA oncogene, and the other (SW48-Mut)
carries a constitutively active mutant allele (H1047R). In

xenograft studies, the subcutaneous injection of SW48WT or SW48-Mut cells into nude mice yielded tumors
of approximately equal volume within 27 days (Fig.
3, left panel). The administration of an oral regimen of
metformin to xenografted mice beginning 1 week before
tumor cell injection failed to significantly alter tumor
size in SW48-WT xenotumors over time. In contrast,
SW48-Mut cells formed metformin-sensitive tumors that
showed significant decreases in tumor volume under the
metformin feeding condition. Compared with the mean
xenograft tumor volume (1138±188 mm3) in the untreated
control animals, oral treatment with metformin resulted in
a notable reduction in the mean tumor volume, to 572±134
mm3 (Fig. 3, right panel). Indeed, the inhibitory effect of
oral metformin against SW48-Mut xenotumors increased
in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum of
approximately 50% at 21 days after cell inoculation.

promising results have been obtained from cultured cells,
animal models, and human trials. Although drugs targeting
the cancer metabolic phenotype are expected to be “magic
bullets” because many cancers show similar metabolic
characteristics, it is important to note that molecular
markers that can distinguish between CRM-sensitive and
CRM-resistant tumors are lacking.
When searching for a cellular mechanism to explain
the effect of DR on tumors, Kalaany and Sabatini found
that DR reduces the activity of insulin-mediated signaling
[8]. This signaling involves the activation of cell-surface
receptors by insulin and the triggering of a downstream
signaling cascade in the cell. This cascade is mediated by
the enzyme PI3K and its suppression by DR enhances cell
death and reduces tumor size in several, but not all, types
of tumor cells. Cancer cell lines with mutations that cause
the constitutive activation of PI3K (or loss-of-function
mutations in PTEN, which normally antagonizes PI3K)
are fully refractory to the tumor growth-inhibitory effects
of DR. These findings are consistent with the effects of
DR on the growth of early tumors due to both systemic
changes in the host (e.g., circulating levels of insulin or
IGF-1) and signaling events that are intrinsic to the tumor
cells (e.g., those involving AMPK, mTOR, or SIRT1,
all of which interact with the PI3K pathway at multiple
levels). In this scenario, the pivotal involvement of the

DISCUSSION
The metabolism of tumors deviates significantly
from that of corresponding normal cells and tissues
[30-37]. Accordingly, the therapeutic use of DR/CRmimetic agents to exploit the differential susceptibility
of malignant versus normal cells to achieve energy
metabolism inhibition is attracting great interest, and

insulin-mediated pathway in determining the ability of
DR to induce anti-tumor effects supports the hypothesis
that drugs that ameliorate insulin resistance in type 2
diabetes might be beneficial in preventing cancer, even
in non-diabetic patients. The same model, however, can
be used to predict which tumors would be vulnerable to
such DR-mimicking pharmacological treatments based
on their mutation profiles, particularly in the genes
encoding PI3K and PTEN. Because it is now evident
that cancers of the liver, colon, and breast are the most
likely to harbor PIK3CA mutations [38-44], with average
mutational frequencies (across reported studies) of 36%,
26%, and 25%, respectively, a lack of responsiveness of
PI3K-mutated carcinomas to putative DR mimetics such
as metformin could have a substantial impact on the evergrowing number of randomized trials that are underway
to evaluate whether and how metformin influences both
the early stages of tumor formation and progression and
cancer recurrence in advanced tumors [45-50].
Here, for the first time, we reveal that PIK3CA
H1047R-mutated,
DR-resistant
MCF10DCIS.com
xenotumors are highly sensitive (>80% tumor growth
inhibition) to the daily i.p. administration of metformin.
Because the oral dosing schedule of metformin only
modestly affected tumor growth (approximately 40%
of tumor growth inhibition), it is tempting to suggest
that i.p. injections of metformin provoke peak plasma
concentrations that are higher than the levels achieved
with oral administration [29]. Pharmacokinetic
analyses are currently underway to confirm whether
the i.p. administration of metformin produces higher
plasma levels of metformin, which might cause more

significant anti-tumor effects. Nevertheless, there was a
correlation between the metformin-stimulated decrease
in proliferation factor mitotic activity index (MAI) in
orally or intraperitoneally treated tumors and the overall
efficacy of the route of metformin administration in
preventing tumor growth in DR-resistant MCF10DCIS.
com xenotumors. Because the significant decrease in
the number of mitotic figures in tumors treated with i.p.
metformin compared with untreated controls was not
coupled with a change in the number of apoptotic cells,
these findings suggested that the antitumor activity of i.p.
metformin against MCF10DCIS.com breast cancer tumor
growth mainly involved the inhibition of cell proliferation.
Moreover, tumors treated with i.p. metformin showed a
relatively substantial increase in stromal connective tissue
that was not supportive of tumor growth [51], as this
increase was accompanied by a decrease in mitotic figure
numbers and reduced cellularity in the small amount of
tumor tissue that remained at the end of the treatment.
Proliferation factor MAI is the strongest prognostic factor
in early breast cancer [52-54], a loss of cellularity has
been shown to correlate with better prognosis and clinical
outcome [55-57], and, ideally, a combination of residual
tumor size and changes in tumor cellularity is useful in
documenting treatment response and outcome. For these
reasons, the response of PIK3CA H1047R-mutated breast
cancer xenotumors to the anti-cancer effects elicited by
the i.p. administration of metformin might be predictive
of more favorable patient outcomes in a clinical setting.
It would be interesting to investigate whether longer
i.p. metformin regimens could still suppress PIK3CA
H1047R-mutated tumors or whether tumors recur after

some interval. Future studies should elucidate whether
responsive tumors harboring PI3K-activating mutations
will become resistant to the beneficial effects of
metformin with time, as most tumors acquire resistance
to chemotherapy.
At advanced tumor stages, signaling pathways other
than the PI3K pathway have been suggested to play key
roles in mediating the anti-cancer effects of DR. Hence,
DR may no longer modulate signaling in advanced tumors
once these tumors activate growth and survival pathways
in a growth factor-independent fashion. This study is the
first to reveal that, remarkably, the isogenic conversion
of a PIK3CA-wild-type tumor into a PIK3CA H1047Rmutated tumor is sufficient to promote sensitization to the
anti-cancer activity of metformin in an in vivo model of
metastatic colon cancer. Considering the emerging role
of PIK3CA mutation status in the treatment selection
process [58-60], these findings might have a significant
impact on the design of future trials evaluating the
potential of combining metformin with targeted therapy.
The hyperactivation of PI3K signaling downstream of
the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2, either through lossof-function PTEN mutations or dominant activating
mutations in the catalytic subunit of PI3K, has been shown
to significantly impair the efficacy of HER2-targeted drugs
such as trastuzumab [61-68]. Accordingly, PI3K inhibitors,
mTOR inhibitors, and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are
being evaluated as effective therapies for overcoming
trastuzumab resistance. In this regard, it is interesting that
the JIMT-1 breast cancer cell line, a model of intrinsic
resistance to trastuzumab that harbors an activating
mutation in the PIK3CA gene and low expression of
PTEN [69], was notably responsive to metformin in
vitro and in vivo [70, 71]. Moreover, when trastuzumab
was combined with metformin to treat PIK3CA-mutated
HER2+ breast carcinomas, tumor volume decreased
sharply, thus suggesting that metformin is sufficient
to overcome in vivo primary resistance to trastuzumab
in these tumors [71]. Because of the accumulating
evidence that PIK3CA mutation/PTEN expression status
predicts colon carcinoma response to the EGFR inhibitor
cetuximab [72-74], we are currently investigating whether
the combination of cetuximab with metformin could be
an effective therapeutic option in PIK3CA-mutated colon
cancer.
After the TP53 suppressor gene, PIK3CA is one of
the most frequently mutated (gain-of-function) genes in
several human carcinomas. A landmark study by Buzzai
et al. [75] used the paired isogenic colon cancer cell
lines HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53-/- to test systemic
treatment with metformin (250 mg kg-1 administered
by daily i.p. injections). Using the clonal breast cancer
cell line MCF10DCIS.com, which harbors the gainof-function H1047R hot-spot mutation in the catalytic
domain of the PI3KCA gene and has been shown to form
DR-refractory xenotumors [8], and taking advantage of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

isogenic conversion of a wild-type tumor into a PIK3CA
H1047R-mutated tumor using the highly metastatic SW48
colorectal cancer cell line, we have shown that metformin
can no longer be considered a bona fide DR mimetic,
at least in terms of anti-cancer activity. In particular,
tumors harboring the insulin-unresponsive, DR-resistant,
PIK3CA-activating mutation H1047R remain sensitive
to the anti-tumoral effects of the drug. Given the high
prevalence of PIK3CA mutations in human carcinomas,
and considering the emerging role of PIK3CA mutation
status in the treatment selection process, these findings
may have a significant impact on the design of future
trials evaluating the potential of combining metformin
with targeted therapy.

Asterand, Inc. (Detroit, MI, USA). X-MAN™ isogenic
cell lines were obtained from Horizon Discovery Ltd
(http://www.horizondiscovery.com). The X-MAN™
isogenic cell line SW48 PI3Kα (H1047R/+), heterozygous
knock-in of PIK3CA kinase domain activating mutation,
was used in this study (HD103-005). The parental cell line,
SW48 PI3K (+/+) was also used. Cells were maintained
according to the supplier recommendations.

Tumor xenograft study.
Mice were randomly divided into groups of five
mice each and orally or intraperitoneally treated as
described in the Results section. To produce xenografts,
approximately 5 × 106 cells were subcutaneously injected
into the dorsal flanks of female athymic nude mice
(4-5 weeks old, 23-25 g; Harlan Laboratories). In both
treatment regimens, body weight and diet consumption
was determined weekly after dosing; tumor size was
measured daily with electronic calipers; and tumor volume
was calculated using the following formula: volume (mm3)
= length × width2 × 0.5. The experiments were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of the Institut d’Investigació Biomèdica
de Bellvitge (IDIBELL; Animal Use Protocol #6302
authorized by the Animal Experimental Commission of the
Catalan Government, Barcelona, Spain). After 56 days of
metformin treatment, the mice were euthanized by cervical
dislocation. The tumors were excised and weighed, and
one portion of the tissue was fixed in buffered formalin,
whereas the remaining portion was stored at -80°C for
further analysis. Tumor volumes were compared using
Student’s t-test. At the end of the tumorigenesis studies,
plasma was isolated by centrifugation of blood samples,

and the levels of circulating insulin were measured using
the Rat/Mouse Insulin ELISA Kit (Millipore, Billerica,
MA).

cell line was used as a baseline day 0 measurement of cell
number without addition of the assay media. Cell numbers
were counted at days 0, 2, 4, and 6 using a Coulter Counter
(Coulter Electronics, Inc.).

Histology.

Cell viability assays.

At the appropriate time points, animals were
euthanized, and tumors were removed and cut in half. One
half was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and the other was
snap frozen. To assess apoptosis and mitosis in the tumor
tissues, sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
xenograft tissues were stained with H&E.

The effect of metformin on cell viability in the
absence or presence of insulin was determined using a
standard colorimetric 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay. For
each treatment, the percent cell viability was calculated
using the following equation: (OD570 of the treated sample/
OD570 of the untreated sample) × 100.

MAI.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

The mitotic figures observable following the H&E
staining protocol were defined according to van Diest
et al. [52], with some modifications, as follows: a) the
absence of nuclear membrane signifying the end of
prophase, and b) the presence of condensed chromosomes
that were clustered together (beginning metaphase),
arranged in a plane (metaphase or anaphase), or in
separate clusters (telophase) all counted as one mitotic
figure. Hyperchromatic nuclei, fragmented chromatin, and
apoptotic nuclei were ignored. All H&E-stained sections
were examined carefully (magnification, ×400), and the
section showing the highest proliferation was selected
for an assessment of mitotic activity. Starting from the
subjectively most mitotically active area of the tumor
and moving between consecutive fields, approximately
10 consecutive high-power fields (HPFs) were counted
with an Olympus BH-2 microscope. No attempts were
made to maximize counting by selecting those fields with
a greater number of mitotic figures. Mitotic counts were
performed without the knowledge of the treatment groupbased immunohistochemical staining. MAI activities were
compared using a two-tailed, two-sample, equal-variance
Student’s t-test.

Proliferation assay.
On day 0, cell lines were seeded in the appropriate
media in 24-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells/well,
and all plates were incubated overnight. On day 1, the
assay plates for each cell line were washed twice with
regular medium in the absence of serum, and the medium
was replaced with medium supplemented with 0.1% serum
alone, 0.1% serum and one of two different concentrations
of insulin (100 and 1,000 ng/mL), 0.1% serum and one of
seven different concentrations of metformin (10 nmol/L,
100 nmol/L, 1 µmol/L, 10 µmol/L, 100 µmol/L, 1
mmol/L, and 10 mmol/L), or a combination of insulin and
metformin, as specified. Three wells per media condition
were included in each plate. An additional plate for each
