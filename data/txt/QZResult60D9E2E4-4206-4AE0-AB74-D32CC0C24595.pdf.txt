Abstract
Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), calling for new strategies to bypass resistance.
Here, we provide first evidence that small-molecule X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) inhibitors in combination with
the death receptor ligand tumor necrosis factor–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) present a novel approach
to trigger apoptosis in CLL, including subgroups with resistant disease or unfavorable prognosis. XIAP, cellular IAP
(cIAP) 1, and cIAP2 are expressed at high levels in primary
CLL samples. Proof-of-concept studies in CLL cell lines show
that subtoxic concentrations of XIAP inhibitors significantly
enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis and also sensitize for
CD95-mediated apoptosis. Importantly also in primary CLL
samples, XIAP inhibitor acts in concert with TRAIL to trigger
apoptosis in 18 of 27 (67%) cases. This XIAP inhibitor–induced
and TRAIL-induced apoptosis involves caspase-3 activation
and is blocked by the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. The cooperative interaction of XIAP inhibitor and TRAIL is even evident
in distinct subgroups of patients with poor prognostic features
(i.e., with 17p deletion, TP53 mutation, chemotherapy-refractory
disease, or unmutated VH genes). Interestingly, cases with
unmutated VH genes were significantly more sensitive to XIAP
inhibitor–induced and TRAIL-induced apoptosis compared
with VH gene–mutated samples, pointing to a role of B-cell
receptor signaling in apoptosis regulation. By showing that
XIAP inhibitors in combination with TRAIL present a new
strategy to trigger apoptosis even in resistant forms and poor
prognostic subgroups of CLL, our findings have important
implications for the development of apoptosis-based therapies in CLL. [Cancer Res 2009;69(23):8977–86]

Introduction
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common type
of leukemia in adults in western societies (1). CLL is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of malignant monoclonal B
cells, which has been largely attributed to defective apoptosis
programs rather than aberrant proliferation (2–4). Indeed, the
vast majority of clonal B cells of CLL are arrested at the G0-G1
phase of the cell cycle, with only a very small population that actively proliferates (5). One of the key factors that contribute to
malignant B-cell longevity is the misbalance between prosurvival

and prodeath molecules (2). Thus, new strategies to reactivate apoptosis may be crucial for the development of molecular targeted
therapies in CLL.
Two principal pathways are involved in the initiation of apoptosis [i.e., the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway or the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway (6, 7)]. Ligation of death receptors
of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, such
as CD95 (APO-1/Fas), by their cognate ligands or agonistic antibodies results in caspase-8 activation at the death-inducing signaling complex, which induces direct cleavage of downstream
effector caspases, such as caspase-3 (8). In the mitochondrial
pathway, the release of cytochrome c, second mitochondriaderived activator of caspase (Smac)/direct inhibitor of apoptosis
(IAP) binding protein with low isoelectric point (DIABLO), or
Omi/high-temperature requirement protein A2 (HtrA2) from
mitochondria into the cytosol results in caspase-3 activation
via formation of the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9–containing
apoptosome complex and via Smac-mediated neutralization of
caspase inhibition by IAP proteins (9).
The concept of inducing apoptosis in cancer cells by ligation of
death receptors is of special interest for cancer therapy because
death receptors are directly linked to the intrinsic death program
of the cell (8). The death-inducing ligand TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) is a prime candidate for clinical development because it has been reported to induce apoptosis in a wide
spectrum of cancer cell lines with no or minimal toxicity on normal human cells (10). Recombinant TRAIL or fully human monoclonal antibodies that specifically target one of the two agonistic
TRAIL receptors are currently evaluated in early clinical trials (10).
However, many human tumors, including hematologic malignancies, are partially or completely resistant to monotherapy with
TRAIL, limiting its therapeutic utility (8, 10–12). CLL cells have previously been reported to be inherently refractory to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis despite the constitutive expression of the apoptosisinducing TRAIL receptors (13–16). This highlights the demand to
develop TRAIL-based combination therapies that counter resistance mechanisms of CLL cells toward TRAIL.
The molecular details that cause resistance of human cancers,
including CLL, to TRAIL are still only partially understood (17). Increasing evidence suggests that high levels of IAP proteins may represent a key antiapoptotic mechanism in cancer cells (18, 19).
Among the IAP family members, it is especially X-linked IAP (XIAP)
that is known for its antiapoptotic function (20). Interestingly, high
levels of XIAP were detected in CLL cells, possibly as part of a NFκB–regulated survival program (20–22). Because XIAP blocks apoptosis at a central point via inhibition of caspases, there is currently
much interest to exploit XIAP as a molecular target in human cancers (19). This has led to the development of small- molecule inhibitors or antisense strategies directed against XIAP (18). We
previously showed proof-of-concept that Smac peptides that antag-

onize XIAP can be used to enhance TRAIL-induced killing in vitro
and in vivo in a glioblastoma model (23). However, the question
whether targeting XIAP is a suitable strategy to prime CLL cells
for TRAIL-induced apoptosis has not yet been addressed. Therefore,
we investigated the effect of small-molecule XIAP inhibitors on
TRAIL-mediated antitumor activity in CLL in the present study.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. CLL cell lines (MEC1, JVM2, and JVM3), which were
established from the peripheral blood of patients with CLL by EBV
transformation (24, 25), were obtained from the German Resource Centre for Biological Material and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS (Life Technologies), 1 mmol/L
glutamine (Life Technologies), 1% penicillin/streptavidin (Life Technologies), and 25 mmol/L HEPES (Biochrom). TRAIL was obtained from
R&D Systems, Inc., and the broad-range caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) was obtained
from Bachem and used to determine the dependency of apoptosis on
caspase activity. XIAP inhibitor 1, XIAP inhibitor 2, and control compound correspond to compounds 2, 11, and 15, respectively, described
by Oost and colleagues (26), and XIAP inhibitors 3 and 4 were described by Chao and colleagues (27) and kindly provided by Idun Pharmaceuticals (now Pfizer, Inc.). The control compound, which is a close
structural analogue that binds to the BIR3 domain of XIAP with a
>100-fold lower affinity (26), was used to correlate the binding affinity
of the XIAP inhibitors to the BIR3 domain of XIAP to their ability to
induce apoptosis. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed as
described previously (28) using the following antibodies: mouse anti–
caspase-8 (ApoTech Corp.), rabbit anti–caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), mouse
anti-XIAP (BD), rabbit anti-Smac (MBL), rabbit anti–cellular IAP (cIAP) 2
(Epitomics), goat anti-cIAP1 and rabbit anti-survivin (R&D Systems), or
mouse anti–β-actin as loading control (Sigma) followed by goat antimouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG or donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated
to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for detection (Amersham Biosciences).
Determination of caspase activity. Caspase activity was determined in
living nonfixed, nonlysed cells as described (29) using the following caspase
substrates conjugated to rhodamine R110: N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-GluVal-Asp-fluoromethylketone-R110 (zDEVD-R110) as caspase-3 substrate
and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethylketone-R110
(zIETD-R110) as caspase-8 substrate (Molecular Probes).
Determination of apoptosis. Apoptosis was determined by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (FACScan, BD Biosciences) of DNA
fragmentation of propidium iodide–stained nuclei or by forward/side scatter analysis as described previously (28, 30) or by Annexin V staining (Roche)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Light scatter analysis is a
FACS-based method to detect apoptotic cells (31).
Determination of TRAIL receptors. To determine surface receptor expression, cells were incubated with mouse anti-human TRAIL-R1, mouse
anti-human TRAIL-R2, mouse anti-human TRAIL-R3, or mouse antihuman TRAIL-R4 (all from ApoTech) monoclonal antibodies for 30 min
at 4°C, washed in PBS containing 1% FCS, incubated with rabbit antimouse F(ab′)2 IgG/biotin (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at 4°C in the dark,
washed in PBS containing 1% FCS, incubated with streptavidinphycoerythrin (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at 4°C in the dark, and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Analysis of CLL patients and primary B cells. A cohort of 27 CLL patients from our institution was analyzed after obtaining informed consent
and approval of the Ethical Committee at Ulm University in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. Criteria for patient selection were a high lymphocyte count and a percentage of lymphocytes in excess of 80%. Clinical and
genetic characterization was performed as previously described and is provided in Table 1 (32–34). Lymphocytes were isolated from blood samples

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (23). December 1, 2009

with Biocoll solution and aliquots were frozen viably at −196°C. Primary B
cells were isolated from buffy coats of healthy donors over the age of 58 y
by Ficoll separation (Biochrom) and magnetic bead isolation using human
CD19 Micro Beads (Miltenyi Biotec) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Biochrom)
supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t
test or Fisher's exact test, where appropriate, using Winstat (R. Fitch Software) or Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS GmbH Software)
software. Interaction between XIAP inhibitors and TRAIL was analyzed by
the combination index (CI) method using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft). A
CI of 0.3 to 0.7 indicates synergism and a CI of 0.1 to 0.3 indicates strong
synergism.

Results
XIAP inhibitors sensitize CLL cell lines for TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. In a first approach to investigate the role of XIAP
in the regulation of apoptosis in CLL, we performed pilot experiments in CLL cell lines. Western blot analysis showed that the
IAP proteins XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, and survivin as well as the endogenous IAP antagonists Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 were all
expressed in CLL cell lines (Fig. 1A, left). Next, we examined the
effect of small-molecule XIAP inhibitors on apoptosis induction
in CLL cell lines using two distinct small-molecule XIAP inhibitors that bind to the BIR3 domain of XIAP with high affinity at
nanomolar concentrations (26). As control, we used a close structural analogue that weakly binds to the BIR3 domain of XIAP
(26). Treatment with XIAP inhibitors as single agents caused no
detectable increase in apoptosis in CLL cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S1), whereas we previously reported that they induce apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells at nanomolar to micromolar concentrations (29).
CLL cells have been described to be inherently resistant to
the death receptor ligand TRAIL (13, 14), calling for strategies
to enhance the efficacy of TRAIL in CLL. We therefore asked
whether XIAP inhibitors could lower the threshold for TRAILtriggered cell death in CLL cells. To address this question, we
first examined expression of TRAIL receptors in CLL cell lines.
Surface staining by flow cytometry showed high membrane expression of the agonistic TRAIL-R2 on all CLL cell lines, whereas TRAIL-R1 and the antagonistic TRAIL receptors TRAIL-R3
and TRAIL-R4 were expressed at much lower levels (Fig. 1A,
right). Importantly, nontoxic concentrations of XIAP inhibitors
significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1B). They also significantly increased
CD95-mediated apoptosis, whereas they did not alter the susceptibility toward the chemotherapeutic agents fludarabine or chlorambucil (Supplementary Fig. S2). Analysis of DNA fragmentation,
one of the biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis, confirmed that
XIAP inhibitor 2 in combination with TRAIL enhanced apoptotic
cell death (Fig. 1C). Similarly, several structurally distinct XIAP
inhibitors cooperated with TRAIL in a dose-dependent manner
to trigger apoptosis (Fig. 1D). Monitoring of caspase activation
by Western blotting showed that XIAP inhibitor 2 substantially
enhanced TRAIL-induced cleavage of caspase-3 into active p17/
12 cleavage fragments, whereas it had no detectable effect on
the processing of caspase-8 (Fig. 2A). Analysis of caspase activity
by enzymatic caspase assay similarly showed that XIAP inhibitor
2 significantly increased TRAIL-induced caspase-3 activity, whereas it did not further augment caspase-8 activity compared with
treatment with TRAIL alone (Fig. 2B). These findings are in line
with a model that inhibition of XIAP primarily promotes activa-

tion of effector caspases such as caspase-3 (20). Addition of the
broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk almost completely
blocked apoptosis in response to the combined treatment with
TRAIL and XIAP inhibitor 2 (Fig. 2C). Together, this set of experiments shows that XIAP inhibitors act in concert with TRAIL to
induce caspase-3 activation and caspase-dependent apoptosis in
CLL cell lines.
XIAP inhibitor acts in concert with TRAIL to induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells. In a second approach, we extended our
studies to primary CLL cells to validate the results obtained in
cell lines. Patients' characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Western blot analysis showed that XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, and
Smac were all expressed in primary CLL cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). By comparison, survivin was expressed at low or undetectable levels in primary CLL cells compared with the CLL cell
line MEC1 (Supplementary Fig. S3), consistent with a previous
study of low survivin expression in primary CLL cells (35). Importantly, XIAP inhibitor 2 acted in concert with TRAIL to induce apoptosis in 18 of 27 (67%) primary CLL samples (Fig. 3A;
Table 1). Analysis of apoptosis by Annexin V staining yielded
similar results compared with forward/side scatter analysis, confirming that apoptotic cell death was induced (compare patient
3 in Fig. 3A and B). Of note, the cooperative interaction of XIAP
inhibitor 2 and TRAIL was even evident in patients with an un-

favorable prognosis, for example, in all four patients with 17p
deletion (patients 3, 14, 16, and 26; Fig. 3A; Table 1), the subgroup with the worst outcome (36). Furthermore, XIAP inhibitor
2 and TRAIL triggered apoptosis in patients with TP53 mutation
(patients 3 and 14; Fig. 3A; Table 1), fludarabine-refractory disease (patients 3, 17, and 22; Fig. 3A; Table 1), and, strikingly, in
almost all patients with unmutated VH genes (patients 3, 4, 5, 6,
10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 26; Fig. 3A; Table 1). Interestingly,
cases with unmutated VH genes were significantly more sensitive
to XIAP inhibitor–triggered and TRAIL-triggered apoptosis compared with those with mutated VH genes (P = 0.04, Fisher's exact
test), although these patients bear a worse prognosis (36). Moreover, XIAP inhibitor 2 induced apoptosis also as single agent in
several primary CLL samples, whereas treatment with TRAIL
alone caused no or minimal apoptosis in CLL samples, with
the exception of patient 26 (Fig. 3A). Although the control compound showed some apoptosis-inducing activity alone or in
combination with TRAIL, this effect was much weaker compared
with XIAP inhibitor 2 (Fig. 3A), consistent with the strongly
reduced ability of the control compound to bind to the BIR3
domain of XIAP (26). One patient was studied at an interval
of 6 months and no difference in the response to treatment
with XIAP inhibitor and TRAIL was observed (Fig. 3A, patients
2a and 2b).

Targeting XIAP in CLL

on treatment with XIAP inhibitor 2 and TRAIL compared with
either treatment alone (Fig. 5C). To directly test the requirement
of caspases for apoptosis induction, we used the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. Addition of zVAD.fmk almost completely inhibited apoptosis on treatment with XIAP inhibitor 2 and
TRAIL, showing that apoptosis occurred in a caspase-dependent
manner (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S7). Of note, the cooperative
effect of XIAP inhibitor 2 and TRAIL to trigger proteolytic activation of caspase-3, enhanced caspase-3 activity, and caspasedependent apoptosis was even observed in a patient with 17
deletion (patient 16 in Fig. 5A–C), the subgroup with the worst
prognosis (36), and occurred irrespective of high Bcl-2 expression
in primary CLL cells (Supplementary Fig. S8). Together, this set of
experiments shows that the XIAP inhibitor acts in concert with
TRAIL to induce caspase-3 activation and caspase-dependent apoptosis in primary human CLL cells even in subgroups with unfavorable prognosis or resistant disease.

Discussion
Defective apoptosis is an inherent feature of CLL and contributes to the accumulation of malignant monoclonal B cells as well
as to treatment resistance (2, 3). Thus, novel approaches are required to restore apoptosis programs in CLL.
XIAP inhibitors sensitize CLL cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. Here, we provide for the first time evidence that
small-molecule XIAP inhibitors in combination with the death receptor ligand TRAIL present a promising new strategy to trigger
apoptosis in CLL, including poor prognostic and chemotherapyresistant subgroups. This conclusion is supported by data obtained in a large panel of primary CLL samples showing that
the XIAP inhibitor cooperates with TRAIL to induce apoptosis
in 18 of 27 (67%) primary CLL cases. The mechanistic basis for
this cooperative interaction was found to involve increased caspase-3 activation and caspase-dependent cell death. This is consistent with the concept that inhibition of XIAP relieves the

XIAP-imposed break on caspase-3 activation, which in turn promotes the effector phase of apoptosis and cell death execution
(18, 19).
It is particularly worth to note that the cooperative interaction of XIAP inhibitor and TRAIL was observed in different subgroups of patients with unfavorable prognosis (36), including all
four investigated patients with 17p deletion, the subgroup with
the worst outcome (31), as well as cases with TP53 mutation,
chemotherapy-resistant disease, or unmutated VH genes. This
suggests that the combination of XIAP inhibitor and TRAIL
may be effective in at least some resistant forms of CLL. Because TRAIL has previously been described to trigger apoptosis
independently of p53 (8), TRAIL in combination with XIAP inhibitors may present an alternative strategy to induce cell death
in cases with TP53 mutation instead of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, which rely on intact p53 for cell death execution. Interestingly, our study reveals that CLL cases with
unmutated VH genes, a feature linked to poor prognosis (1),
were significantly more sensitive to XIAP inhibitor–induced
and TRAIL-induced apoptosis compared with those with mutated VH genes. This finding is in line with the concept that CLL
cells with unmutated VH genes are more prone to respond not
only to survival but also to apoptotic stimuli, and points to a
role of B-cell receptor signaling in the regulation of apoptosis
(1). We observed no differences in Bcl-2 expression or the phosphorylation status of Akt or extracellular signal-regulated kinase
between cases with unmutated V H genes, which responded
to XIAP inhibitor and TRAIL, and nonresponsive cases with
mutated VH genes (data not shown). It therefore remains to
be determined in future studies which signal tranduction events
are involved in the regulation of apoptosis sensitivity in CLL
cells with unmutated VH genes. Nevertheless, the IgVH mutation
status may serve as a biomarker to predict the responsiveness of
CLL patients toward the combination therapy with XIAP inhibitor and TRAIL, a hypothesis to be confirmed in a larger group
of CLL patients.

High expression of XIAP has previously been reported in CLL,
possibly as part of a NF-κB–regulated survival program (20–22).
In addition, XIAP has recently been implicated in apoptosis resistance that is imposed by constitutively activated Notch signaling in
CLL cells (37), further indicating that XIAP may be a relevant target in CLL. However, the functional relevance of XIAP in the resistance of CLL toward TRAIL has not yet been explored. Thus, the
present study is the first report that inhibition of XIAP by small
molecules sensitizes CLL cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Evasion of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in CLL has previously been

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (23). December 1, 2009

linked to low TRAIL receptor expression in one study (13), whereas
constitutive expression of both TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 and no
correlation between agonistic TRAIL receptors and the sensitivity
of CLL cells to TRAIL were observed in other studies (14, 15).
Further, high levels of the antiapoptotic death effector domain–
containing proteins c-FLIP and PED were reported to interfere
with activation of caspase-8 at the receptor signaling complex in
CLL (13, 15, 16). Moreover, impaired mitochondrial signaling because of high expression levels of Bcl-2 has been implicated in apoptosis resistance in CLL (38, 39). To this end, it is important to

Targeting XIAP in CLL

note that the combination of XIAP inhibitor and TRAIL triggered
apoptosis in primary CLL cells irrespective of high Bcl-2 levels, a
characteristic feature of CLL (38, 39). These findings are in line
with our recent results that XIAP inhibitors and TRAIL bypass
Bcl-2–mediated resistance to TRAIL by directly triggering the effector
phase of apoptosis (40).
Of note, our results also show that apoptosis sensitization by
XIAP inhibitors is not restricted to TRAIL and extends to CD95
as another death receptor system. This suggests that the neutralization of XIAP more broadly enhances the susceptibility of CLL
cells toward death receptor–mediated apoptosis. This notion is
further supported by a report showing that phenylurea-based compounds that target the BIR2 domain of XIAP enhance the sensitivity of CD40-stimulated CLL cells to CD95-triggered apoptosis (41).
Compared with death receptor stimulation via CD95 or TRAIL receptors, we observed no sensitization for apoptosis on treatment
with commonly used chemotherapeutic agents such as fludarabine
or chlorambucil. Along these lines, Silva and colleagues reported
that the expression of XIAP, cIAP1, or cIAP2 in CLL cells did not
correlate with sensitivity to fludarabine-induced apoptosis (42). Although the underlying mechanisms of this differential sensitization
for death receptor–mediated versus chemotherapy-mediated cell
death have not yet been identified, these findings indicate that inhibition of XIAP may be particularly promising to lower the threshold for death receptor–mediated apoptosis in CLL cells, which may
also have implications for immune-mediated tumor control. Compared with CLL cells, nonmalignant B cells showed a lower susceptibility to the combined treatment with XIAP inhibitors and TRAIL.
The molecular basis for this differential sensitivity is subject to future investigations.

Beyond CLL, XIAP inhibitors have recently been reported by our
group and other investigators to act in concert with TRAIL to trigger apoptosis in childhood acute leukemia, pancreatic, colon, or
breast carcinoma cells (29, 43, 44). In addition, low–molecular
weight Smac mimetics displayed antitumor activities as single
agents in multiple myeloma and several solid cancers (45–49).
These results highlight the therapeutic potential of small-molecule
XIAP inhibitors to promote apoptosis in cancer cells. Because IAP
inhibitors and TRAIL receptor agonists are currently under evaluation in early clinical trials (10, 18), it is crucial to identify those
cancers that may benefit from these new treatment options. As
the present study indicates that the combination of XIAP inhibitors and TRAIL presents a new approach to bypass apoptosis resistance in CLL, our findings have important implications for the
development of apoptosis-targeted therapies in CLL.
