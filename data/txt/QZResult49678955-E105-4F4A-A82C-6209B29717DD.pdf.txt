ABSTRACT:

The PIM family of oncogenic serine/threonine kinases regulates tumour cell
proliferation. To identify proliferative signaling pathways that are regulated by PIM
kinases we analyzed gene expression differences in DU-145 and PC3 prostate cancer
derived cells induced by treatment with the recently developed highly selective PIM
kinase inhibitor M-110. This identified 97 genes the expression of which is affected
by M-110 in both cell lines. We then focused on the M-110 induced up regulation of
the MIG6 gene that encodes a negative regulator of EGFR signaling. Here we show
that M-110 and the structurally unrelated PIM kinase inhibitor SGI-1776 up regulate
MIG6 in DU-145 and PC3 cells. Knockdown of PIM-1 but not of PIM-2 or PIM-3 also
up regulates MIG6 expression, which identifies MIG6 as a PIM-1 regulated gene. In
agreement with the role of MIG6 protein as a negative regulator of EGFR signaling we
found that M-110 treatment inhibits EGF induced EGFR activation and the activation of
the downstream ERK MAPkinase pathway. The biological significance of these findings
are demonstrated by the fact that co-treatment of DU-145 or PC3 cells with the EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gefitinib and M-110 or SGI-1776 has synergistic inhibitory
effects on cell proliferation. These experiments define a novel biological function of
PIM-1 as a co-regulator of EGFR signaling and suggest that PIM inhibitors may be used
in combination therapies to increase the efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

2 are implicated in prostate cancer development [2, 3],
PIM-1 is over expressed in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma and bladder cancer [4, 5] and PIM-3 is over
expressed in colorectal, pancreatic and hepatocellular
carcinoma [6-8]. PIM-1 and PIM-2 over expression in
prostate cancer correlates with tumour progression [2]
and over expression of exogenous PIM-1 or PIM-2 in
prostate cancer cell lines increases cell proliferation [9,
10]. The molecular mechanisms by which PIM kinases
regulate tumour cell proliferation may include the
phosphorylation and inactivation of cell cycle inhibitors
p27Kip1 [10] or p21cip1 [11] or the activation of molecules
that positively regulate cell cycle progression such as
CDC25A, CDC25C or the kinase C-TAK1[12]. PIM
kinases may regulate cell viability by phosphorylating

The PIM family of oncogenic serine/threonine
kinases consists of three members, PIM-1, PIM-2 and
PIM-3. The pim-1 proto-oncogene was first identified
as a locus frequently activated by proviral integration
in Moloney murine leukemia virus induced mouse
T-cell lymphomas and pim-2 was identified as a gene
frequently activated in secondary transplants of virus
induced lymphomas. Pim-3 was identified as a Pim1 and Pim-2 related kinase. The oncogenic nature of
Pim-1 and Pim-2 was confirmed by the observation that
transgenic mice over expressing these kinases in the
lymphoid system developed lymphomas. Simultaneous
over expression of c-myc further increased the frequency
of lymphomagenesis [1]. PIM kinases are also involved
in the development of solid tumors. PIM-1 and PIMwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the apoptotic proteins BAD and ASK1 [13, 14] and are
involved in the regulation of drug resistance [15].
In addition to the identification of individual PIM
substrates, the major proliferative signaling pathways
that are regulated by PIM kinases are beginning to be
identified. We have recently characterized a novel small
molecule designated M-110, as a highly selective inhibitor
of all three PIM kinase isoforms and showed that M-110
inhibits, through inhibition of PIM-3, but not of PIM-1
or of PIM-2, the phosphorylation of STAT3 on tyrosine
residue 705 in the prostate cancer derived cell line DU145 and the pancreatic cancer derived cell line MiaPaCa2
[16]. STAT3 is an oncogenic transcription factor that is
activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine residue 705 and
the importance of STAT3 signaling in cell proliferation
is well documented [17, 18]. STAT3 is activated by
stimulation of IL-6 which is an important autocrine/
paracrine growth factor for prostate cancers and M-110
was shown to interfere with IL-6 induced activation
of STAT3. However, not all prostate cancer cell lines
that are sensitive to M-110 treatment express activated
STAT3. For instance the proliferation of 22Rv1 and PC3
cells is inhibited by M-110. However, 22Rv1 cells do not
express active STAT3 but express active STAT5 that is
not affected by M-110 treatment [16]. PC3 cells do not
express STAT3 because of a genomic deletion containing
the STAT3 gene [19]. Therefore it is likely that the M-110
induced inhibition of cell proliferation is mediated through
inhibition of multiple proliferative pathways in a cell type
dependent manner.
EGFR over expression or mutations leads to
abnormal EGFR signaling which is linked to the
development of many tumours [20]. For instance EGFR
expression is increased in a significant proportion
of prostate cancer patients and increased expression
correlates with increased risk of relapse and progression
to castration resistant disease [21-23]. Binding of EGF
to the EGFR (ErbB1) results in homodimerization

RESULTS
PIM-1 regulates expression of the ERBB inhibitor
MIG6
To identify signaling pathways that are affected by
M-110 treatment of prostate cancer cells, we used micro
array analyses to determine changes in gene expression
induced by M-110 treatment of two prostate cancer
cell lines, DU-145 and PC3. Cells were treated with 10
µM M-110 or with vehicle only (DMSO) for 8 hrs, and
RNA was extracted from 4 independent experiments and
analyzed for genome wide changes in gene expression
using Agilent 28004 Whole Human Genome expression
microarrays. Analyses showed that the expression of
257 probes representing genes changed > 2-fold after
treatment of DU-145 cells with M-110 compared to
treatment with DMSO only. In PC3 treated cells, 113
gene expression differences were identified and 97 gene
expression differences were common among DU-145 and
PC3 cells Of these, 59 were up regulated and 38 were
down regulated by M-110 treatment in both cell lines

or heterodimerization of the EGFR with any of three
EGFR related receptors ErbB2-4. Dimerization leads to
phosphorylation of a number of tyrosine residues present
in the cytoplasmic portion of the EGFR by the intracellular
receptor tyrosine kinase domain. Intracellular proteins
with SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding motifs are then
recruited to the activated tyrosine phosphorylated receptor
to activate a number of proliferative signaling pathways
such as the ERK MAPkinase and the PI3-kinase/AKT
pathways. Signaling through the EGFR is limited by a
number of negative feedback inhibitory proteins that are
induced by EGF signaling [24]. One such protein is MIG6
(also known as RALT or ERRFI1) that binds preferentially
to the activated EGFR and inhibits its kinase activity
[25, 26]. MIG6 may also regulate the internalization
and degradation of the EGFR [27, 28]. Here we report
that treatment of prostate cancer cells with M-110 or a
structurally unrelated PIM kinase inhibitor SGI-1776
increases the expression of MIG6 RNA and protein and
inhibits EGF induced activation of the EGFR and the
downstream ERK MAPkinase pathway. Knockdown of
PIM-1 but not of PIM-2 or of PIM-3 up regulates MIG6
expression. This identifies a novel biological function of
PIM-1 as a positive co-regulator of the EGF/EGFR/ERK
MAPkinase pathway. Furthermore we show synergistic
effects of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gefitinib and
PIM kinase inhibitors on prostate cancer cell proliferation.
These results provide new insights into the oncogenic
action of PIM kinases and support the development of
PIM isoform specific inhibitors as anti-cancer agents to
increase the efficacy of EGFR targeted chemotherapy.

(Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1). RT-qPCR assays
for expression of genes included in the 97 common gene
set validated the microarray results for 8 genes analyzed
(Supplementary Figure 1), showing that the microarray
results are of high quality and can be used to predict
M-110 induced gene expression differences in DU-145
and PC3 cells with high confidence.
M-110 is a selective inhibitor of PIM kinases and
therefore we expected that a significant fraction of gene
expression differences would involve genes that are
targets of transcription factors that are modulated by PIM
kinases. An extensive literature review suggest that this is
the case because 36 genes in the 97 common gene set (~
40 %) affected by M-110 treatment have previously been
identified as targets for the PIM modulated transcription
factors c-myc [29, 30], c-myc and PIM-1 [31] , FOXO3a
[32], c-Myb [33, 34] or RUNX1-3 [35, 36] (Table 1).

Several genes in the common 36 gene set may contribute
to M-110 mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, but we
focused on the expression of MIG6, because it encodes
an important inhibitor of EGFR signaling [37, 38],
suggesting that M-110 treatment of prostate cancer cells
negatively affects signaling through the EGFR. Figure
2A shows that M-110 treatment for 8 hrs up regulates
MIG6 RNA in PC3 and DU-145 cells, validating the
micro array results obtained after 8 hr of treatment. We
also included a 4 hr treatment which showed that the
effect of M-110 treatment on the expression of MIG6 is a
relatively early event. Treatment with M-142, an inactive
derivative of M-110 that does not inhibit PIM kinase or
cell proliferation [16] had no effect on the expression of
MIG6 RNA suggesting that up regulation of MIG6 RNA
is a consequence of M-110 mediated PIM inhibition. To
further support the involvement of PIM kinases in the

regulation of MIG6 we also treated DU-145 and PC3
cells with SGI-1776, a well defined PIM kinase inhibitor
that is not structurally related to M-110 [39]. As shown in
Figure 2A treatment of PC3 cells for 4 hr or 8 hr with 10
μM SGI-1776 up regulates MIG6 RNA expression to a
similar extent as treatment with M-110. Treatment of DU145 cells with SGI-1776 also up regulates MIG6 RNA
after 4 hr but the response of DU-145 cells to 10 μM SGI1776 appears more transient than the response to 10 μM
M-110. Nevertheless the fact that PC3 cells and DU-145
cells up regulate MIG6 expression after treatment with
two unrelated PIM kinase inhibitors, but not with M-142
strongly suggests a role for PIM kinases in the regulation
of MIG6 expression. To determine whether one or more
PIM isoforms are involved in the regulation of MIG6
gene expression we used PIM isoform specific siRNAs to
selectively knockdown PIM-1, PIM-2 or PIM-3. We used
these isoform specific PIM siRNAs previously to show
that PIM-3 is a positive regulator of STAT3-tyrosine 705
phosphorylation [16]. Figure 2B shows that MIG6 RNA
is up regulated in DU-145 and PC3 cells treated with
siPIM-1 but not in cells treated with siPIM-2, siPIM-3,
or a control siRNA. These results show that PIM-1 but

The up regulation of MIG6 RNA by M-110 results
in a robust increase in MIG6 protein as determined by
Western blotting of M-110 and M-142 treated PC3 and
DU-145 cells (Figure 2C). The specificity of the antiMIG6 antibodies was verified by analyzing siMIG6
treated DU-145 cells which identified MIG6 as a ~ 52Kd
protein (Supplementary Figure 2B). To determine whether
the MIG6 protein functions as a negative regulator of
EGFR activation, we down regulated expression of MIG6
RNA and tested whether this resulted in increased EGFR
activation as measured by the expression of p-EGFRtyr1068.

specificity of the PIM isoform specific siRNAs is shown
in Supplementary Figure 2A. The up regulation of PIM-2
and PIM-3 by siPIM1 has been observed before [16] but
is unlikely to impact the conclusion that MIG6 is a PIM-1
regulated gene as the PIM-2 and PIM-3 siRNAs have no
effect on MIG6 expression.

well with EGFR activation [40]. Figure 2D shows that
treatment of DU-145 or PC3 cells with MIG6 siRNA but
not with control siRNA resulted in increased response to
EGF, which shows that the MIG6 protein functions as a
negative regulator of EGFR signaling in prostate cancer
derived cells. Therefore the M-110 induced up regulation
of MIG6 is expected to inhibit EGFR activation in PC3
and DU-145 cells. Supplemental Figure 3A,B shows that
both cell lines respond robustly to EGF stimulation. To
determine whether M-110 treatment leads to inhibition
of EGFR activation we pre-treated PC3 or DU-145
cells with M-110 for 16 hrs followed by 15 min of
EGF stimulation. We then measured both the changes
in tyrosine phosphorylated EGFR as well as possible
changes in the expression of total EGFR protein because
of the potential for MIG6 to increase EGFR internalization
and degradation. Treatment with M-110 before addition
of EGF significantly inhibits the EGF induced increase
in EGFRtyr1068 in PC3 as compared to pre treatment with
DMSO, the vehicle for the compounds used (Figure 3A,C)
or DU-145 cells (Figure 3D,F). Pre-treatment of PC3 and
DU-145 cells with M-110 also reduces the expression

of total EGFR protein (Figure 3B,C and E,F). Since the
decrease in p-EGFRtyr1068 is greater than the decrease in
total EGFR (P<0.05 for both cell lines) the decrease in
activated, tyrosine phosphorylated EGFR in PC3 and DU145 cells may in part be due to decreased phosphorylation
and in part to down regulation of the receptor protein. As
expected, pre-treatment with M-142 had no significant
effect on subsequent EGF stimulation. To determine the
effect of decreased EGFR activation on downstream
signaling events, we also measured the effect of M-110
treatment on EGF induced activation of the ERK MAP
kinase pathway. EGF treatment of PC3 and DU-145 cells
increases the expression of phosphorylated activated
MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 (Supplementary Figure 3C-F) and
treatment with M-110 but not with DMSO or M-142
significantly inhibits the EGF induced activation of both
components of the ERK MAPkinase pathway (Figure 4).
Collectively these results show that M-110 inhibits EGF
signaling through the EGFR as shown by inhibition of
EGF induced EGFRtyr1068 expression and of EGF induced
ERK MAPkinase pathway activation.

PIM inhibitors increase the efficacy of the EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gefitinib

in panels A and B with the highest concentrations at 4x
their respective IC50s. PC3 and DU-145 cells were
then treated with two-fold serial dilutions of these drug
combinations or of the single agents and the CI values
were calculated at different effect levels (affected fraction
or Fa) using the CompuSyn software developed by
Chou and Martin. The CI-Fa plots presented in Figure
5C,D show that the CI values are < 1 over a large range
of Fa values indicating synergistic interactions between
Gefitinib and SGI-1776 or M-110. It is not clear why the
Gefitinib / PIM kinase combinations show only additive
or even significant antagonism at low Fa values. However
these Fa values have little potential clinical applications
and our experiments clearly demonstrate that under
conditions where cell proliferation is inhibited by > 80
% Gefitinib and PIM kinase inhibitors act synergistically.

Both M-110 and SGI-1776 treatment up regulates
MIG6 expression, which results in inhibition of EGFR
tyrosine kinase activity. Therefore, our results suggest
that the efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
such as Gefitinib is increased by the addition of M-110
or SGI-1776. To test this hypothesis we first treated PC3
and DU-145 cells with Gefitinib, SGI-1776 or M-110
as single agents or with combinations of Gefitinib and
M-110 or Gefitinib and SGI-1776. The concentrations of
the compounds used as single agents or in combinations
were used at suboptimal concentrations close to 0.5x
their respective IC50s for growth inhibition. The IC50s
are shown in Table 2. Figure 5A,B shows that the effects
of the combination treatments are significantly greater
than the effects of the single agent treatments suggesting
additive or synergistic interactions. In a second set of
experiments we then determined whether the interactions
between Gefitinib and the two PIM kinase inhibitors are

These experiments illustrate the biological significance
of our finding that MIG6 is a PIM-1 regulated gene and
suggests a way to increase the efficacy of EGFR inhibitor
based chemotherapy.

that PIM-3 but not PIM-1 or PIM-2 is a co-regulator of
STAT3 activation in DU-145 cells [16]. Combined with
our current data that PIM-1 but not PIM-2 or PIM-3 is coregulator of EGFR activation in DU-145 and PC3 cells,
it is evident that PIM-1 and PIM-3 can independently
regulate two important proliferative signaling pathways
even when expressed in the same cells. The mechanisms
underlying the PIM-1 isoform specific regulation of MIG6
are unknown. MIG6 is a RUNX1 regulated gene [36] and
PIM-1 is known to phosphorylate RUNX3 in vitro and in
HEK293 cells. PIM-1 was also shown to phosphorylate
RUNX1 in vitro [44, 45]. The PIM-1 phosphorylation
sites on RUNX1 have not been rigorously identified but it
is possible that the isoform specificity is determined at the
level of RUNX1 phosphorylation. One could speculate
that PIM-1 and PIM-3 phosphorylate different residues
of RUNX1 that may have different consequences for the
activity of RUNX1. If so, the differences are likely to be
quantitative rather than qualitative as was shown for the
phosphorylation of the BAD protein in which different
residues are phosphorylated by PIM-1 and PIM3 with
PIM-1 displaying a preference for residue Ser112 and
PIM-3 displaying a preference for Ser136 and Ser155
[46]. However it should be noted that RUNX1 does not
contain an amino acid sequence with high homology to
the Lys/Arg rich PIM consensus phosphorylation site and

DISCUSSION
Our results document two important new findings.
First, using two structurally unrelated and highly selective
small molecule PIM kinase inhibitors and PIM kinase
isoform specific siRNAs we show that the regulation of
MIG6 involves PIM-1 but not PIM-2 or PIM-3. Together
with the negative effect of M-110 on EGFR activation this
defines a novel biological function for PIM-1 as a positive
co-regulator of signaling through the EGFR. Second, we
show that PIM kinase inhibitors increase the efficacy of
the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib.
The finding that PIM-1 but not PIM-2 or PIM3 is involved in the regulation of MIG6 expression is
significant as little is known about PIM isoform specific
functions. Two rare examples of studies that were able to
define PIM isoform specific functions showed that PIM1 but not PIM-2 regulates CXCR4 membrane expression
[42] and that PIM-2 but not PIM-1 confers resistance
to rapamycin mediated inhibition of IL-3 stimulated
bone marrow cell growth [43]. The role of PIM-3 was
not specifically addressed in these studies. Using PIM
isoform specific siRNAs we have previously shown

the phosphorylation of RUNX1 by PIM-1 at an atypical
site may be PIM-1 specific.
The MIG6 gene expression is also up regulated
by EGF/EGFR stimulation in an ERK MAPkinase
dependent manner [47] an observation that prompted the
classification of MIG6 as a negative feedback inhibitor of
EGF/EGFR signaling. To rule out that the EGF induced
up regulation of MIG6 influences our measurements
of the effect of M-110 or SGI-1776 on up regulation of
MIG6, we determined the time course of EGF induced
MIG6 RNA expression by RT-qPCR in DU-145 and PC3
cells and found that increases in MIG6 RNA are first
detectable between 30 and 60 min after addition of EGF
(Supplementary Figure 4). It is thus unlikely that our
results on PIM inhibitor mediated inhibition of EGFR
activation measured after 15 min of EGF stimulation are
influenced by EGF up regulated MIG6.
Consistent with the known functions of MIG6,
down regulation of MIG6 by siRNA increased EGF
induced activation of EGFR. Signaling through the EGFR
is involved in many aspects of tumour development,
contributing to cancer cell proliferation, cell survival
and cell motility and invasion [20, 48]. For instance,
growth of early prostate tumours is androgen dependent
and is therefore sensitive to androgen ablation. However
upon relapse the disease almost invariably progresses to
castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in which prostate
tumours acquire the capacity to grow in castrate levels
of hormone. Expression of the EGFR is up regulated in
CRPC [22, 23] suggesting that growth of these late stage
tumours is at least in part driven by exaggerated signaling
through the EGFR. Antibodies against the ligand binding
domain of EGFR (Erbitux) or small molecules that
inhibit the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (Gefitinib,
Erlotinib) have been developed as therapeutic agents for
treatment of EGFR driven tumours and these reagents are
successfully employed in the clinic, especially against
subsets of patients with NSCLC. However the results
of EGFR kinase inhibitors for the treatment of CRPC
have been somewhat disappointing [49, 50]. This lack
of in vivo efficacy is reflected by the high in vitro IC50
values of Gefitinib for growth inhibition of DU-145 and
PC3 cells. Thus our results that combinations of Gefitinib
and PIM inhibitors show synergistic effects on growth
inhibition therefore has potential therapeutic implications
for treatment of CRPC patients since the effective dose
of Gefitinib in combination with PIM inhibitors can be
lowered to 2.5 μM, a concentration that may be attainable
in plasma of patients treated with high dose once daily
Gefitinib [51]. In addition to the potential use of Gefitinib
/ PIM kinase inhibitor combination in the treatment of
CRPC, this combination may be especially attractive
in treatment of EGF driven tumours such as NSCLC in
which Gefitinib as a single agent already has significant
activity. Adding a PIM inhibitor leading to up regulation of
MIG6 may have a broader effect on EGFR signaling than
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatment with EGFR specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors
alone because MIG6 also inhibits signaling through the
EGFR related receptor ERBB2 [52]. Up regulation of
ERBB2 is an important factor of the acquired resistance to
EGFR targeted therapies. Thus addition of PIM inhibitors
not only increases the initial efficacy of EGFR targeted
therapies but by inhibiting HER2 may also significantly
increase the disease free interval between treatment and
relapse.
The identification of PIM-1 as a positive regulator
of EGF/EGFR signaling expands our knowledge of
oncogenic signaling pathways that are controlled by single
PIM kinase isoforms. This suggest that developing PIM
isoform specific inhibitors will not only allow a further
characterization of PIM isoform specific functions but
also allow a targeted approach to cancer treatment through
the rational design of combination therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microarray Analyses
200 ng of starting material for each sample as well
as Human Universal Reference RNA were amplified
and labeled with Cy5 and Cy3 dyes, respectively, and
hybridized to Agilent 28004 Human Whole Genome
microarrays according to the standard manufacturers
protocols. Microarray slides were scanned on a G2565C
DNA Scanner and quantified using Feature Extraction
Software version 10.7.1.1.3 (Agilent). Quality of
individual samples was assessed in R (v2.10) using the
ArrayQualityMetrics Bioconductor package [53]. Data
were then imported into GeneSpring (v11.5.1, Agilent)
for further analyses.
Normalization consisted of an Agilent Spatial
Detrending normalization followed by a median centred
“per-gene” normalization. All statistics were carried out
on log base 2 converted data. Data were first filtered such
that only probes that were in the upper 80th percentile of
measured expression in 75 percent of the samples for any
1 out of the 4 categories (PC3 or DU145 M110 treated or
DMSO control) were used, leaving 37678 probes out of
the 42545 probes found on the array for further analysis.
Statistical testing consisted of a 2-way ANOVA (treatment
type and cell type) with a Benjamini and Hochberg [54]
multiple testing correction False Discovery Rate set
to p<0.05. 7988 probes were found to be significantly
different between the cell types and 401 were found
between the treatment versus control category. Of the 401
probes found different between the M110 treatment and
DMSO control, 257 probes in the DU145 cell type and
113 in the PC3 cell type were greater than 2 fold different
and 97 probes were found in common between the two
cell types.
