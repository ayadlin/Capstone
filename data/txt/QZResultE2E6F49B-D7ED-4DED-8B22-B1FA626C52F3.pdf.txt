Abstract
Previous studies suggest that carotenoids and tocopherols
(vitamin E compounds) may be inversely associated with
prostate cancer risk, yet little is known about how they
affect prostate cancer progression and survival. We investigated whether serum A-tocopherol, B-carotene, and retinol
concentrations, or the A-tocopherol and B-carotene trial
supplementation, affected survival of men diagnosed with
prostate cancer during the A-Tocopherol, B-Carotene Cancer
Prevention Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled primary prevention trial testing the effects
of B-carotene and A-tocopherol supplements on cancer
incidence in adult male smokers in southwestern Finland
(n = 29,133). Prostate cancer survival was examined using
the Kaplan-Meier method with deaths from other causes
treated as censoring, and using Cox proportional hazards
regression models with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for family history of prostate
cancer, age at randomization, benign prostatic hyperplasia,
age and stage at diagnosis, height, body mass index, and
serum cholesterol. As of April 2005, 1,891 men were diagnosed
with prostate cancer and 395 died of their disease. Higher
serum A-tocopherol at baseline was associated with improved
prostate cancer survival (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45–1.00),
especially among cases who had received the A-tocopherol
intervention of the trial and who were in the highest quintile
of A-tocopherol at baseline (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.20–0.90)
or at the 3-year follow-up measurement (HR, 0.26; 95% CI,
0.09–0.71). Serum B-carotene, serum retinol, and supplemental B-carotene had no apparent effects on survival. These
findings suggest that higher A-tocopherol (and not B-carotene
or retinol) status increases overall prostate cancer survival.
Further investigations, possibly including randomized studies,
are needed to confirm this observation. [Cancer Res
2009;69(9):3833–41]

Introduction
Although rates vary throughout the world, prostate cancer is the
most common cancer diagnosed in the United States, accounting
for an estimated 186,320 new cases and 28,660 deaths annually (1).
The few well-established risk factors for prostate cancer incidence
include increasing age, race/ethnicity (being African American or

Jamaican), and having a positive family history (1, 2). Additional
factors such as height, physical activity, body mass index (BMI),
hormones, and diet are under investigation (2–4). Environmental
factors such as diet are thought to be significant contributors as
migrants tend to take on the prostate cancer risk profiles of their
new country after arriving. In one study of Japanese men who
emigrated to Los Angeles, incidence rates were four to nine times
higher for the first generation immigrants compared with men
living in Japan, and by the second generation, the rates were
approximately the same as the general U.S. population (5).
Fortunately, 5-year survival is almost 100%, when diagnosed with
localized or regional disease, and there are f2 million prostate
cancer survivors in the United States. (1, 6). Yet, little is known
about how diet affects prostate cancer progression and survival.
Most studies have investigated diet as an etiologic factor
for prostate cancer and a considerable number have focused
on carotenoids and tocopherols but with mixed results. Two
large cohort studies, NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study and the
a-Tocopherol, h-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study,
reported protective associations of a-tocopherol with advanced
prostate cancer (7, 8), whereas no associations were seen between
overall prostate cancer risk and individual carotenoids, retinol, or
tocopherols in the European Prospective Investigation Cohort (9)
or the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening
Trial (10). Vitamin E was protective in smokers, as were h-carotene
supplements in men with low h-carotene intake, in the Prostate,
Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian trial (10). Currently, several
suspected risk factors, such as BMI, soy, fish oil, meat intake,
calcium, lycopene, vitamins C and E, and selenium, are also being
studied in relation to prostate cancer progression and survival
(11–13). However, such research investigating carotenoids and
tocopherols is scant. One notable exception came from a cohort of
health professionals that examined prediagnostic and postdiagnostic diet and found that consumption of tomato sauce and fish
were protective against disease progression, although tocopherols
and individual carotenoids were not assessed (14).
Carotenoids and tocopherols (vitamin E) are thought to affect
disease risk, progression, and survival through several mechanisms.
Carotenoids, the naturally occurring pigments found in many fruits
and vegetables, have the antioxidant capacity to quench singlet
oxygen and, thus, are thought to prevent conditions related to
oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular disease and many cancers
(15). Vitamin E consists of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols, of
which, a-tocopherol is the most biologically active form in humans
and is present in plant and seed oils, nuts, margarine, seeds, and
cereal grains. Also an antioxidant, a-tocopherol is hypothesized to
prevent cancer by inhibiting formation of carcinogens such as
nitrosamines, by decreasing cell proliferation, or by increasing
antibody production and enhancing cell-mediated immunity (16).

In this report, we prospectively examined whether serum
a-tocopherol, h-carotene, and retinol measured at study entry
and after 3 years affected survival time in men diagnosed with
prostate cancer while enrolled in the ATBC Study from 1985
to 2005.

Materials and Methods
Study population. Data were from the ATBC Study, which was a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial
designed to study the effects of h-carotene and a-tocopherol supplements
on cancer incidence in 29,133 Caucasian male smokers ages 50 to 69 y in
southwestern Finland enrolled between 1985 and 1988 (17). Men who had
prior cancer or serious illness or who reported current use of dietary
supplements with >20 mg vitamin E, >20,000 IU vitamin A, or >6 mg
h-carotene were ineligible. Enrolled men were randomly assigned to
one of 4 groups based on a 2  2 factorial design: (a) a-tocopherol
(dl-a-tocopherol acetate, 50 mg/d), (b) h-carotene (20 mg/d), (c) both
supplements, or (d) placebo capsules for 5 to 8 y until death or trial closure.
Although the trial ended on April 30, 1993, on-going follow-up continues
through the Finnish Cancer Registry. As of April 30, 2005, there were 1,891
men diagnosed with prostate cancer and 395 deaths due to prostate cancer.
The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the U.S.
National Cancer Institute and the National Public Health Institute of
Finland, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant
before randomization.
Case identification. Incident prostate cancer cases (International
Classification of Diseases 9, code 185), diagnosed by April 30, 2005
(i.e., up to 20 y of follow-up), were identified through the Finnish Cancer
Registry, which provides nearly 100% case ascertainment (18). For cases
diagnosed through September 2001, the medical records were reviewed

centrally by one or two study oncologist(s) for diagnostic confirmation and
staging, and cases with available histopathologic or cytologic specimens
were reviewed and confirmed by pathologists. Prostate cancer cases
diagnosed after September 2001 had only the Finnish Cancer Registry data
for site, histology, and date of diagnosis. Advanced cases (n = 397) were
defined as those cases with stage III or IV of the tumor-node-metastasis
staging system, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (19).
Stage information was only available for those cases diagnosed through
September 2001; all cases without stage information were analyzed as a
separate missing category. Finland has not adopted population-based
prostate-specific antigen screening programs, and only 1 of 246 cases that
occurred during the trial period was detected by prostate-specific antigen
screening (20). Based on data on the prostate cancers diagnosed by
September 2001, we estimate that f10% or fewer of the prostate cancer
cases were initially detected through an elevated prostate-specific antigen
screen. Deaths were identified from the Register of Causes of Death. Specific
causes were derived from the official underlying cause of death.
Data collection. At baseline, study subjects completed general risk
factor, smoking, and medical history questionnaires, a food frequency
questionnaire of the previous 12 mo, and an exam where height and weight
were measured by specially trained registered nurses (21). Participants also
provided an overnight fasting serum sample, at baseline and 3 y, that
was protected from light and stored at 70jC until it was analyzed for
a-tocopherol, h-carotene, and retinol using high-performance liquid
chromatography (22). Total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
concentrations were measured using an enzymatic assay (CHOD-PAP
method; Boehringer Mannheim; ref. 23).
Statistical methods. Follow-up time was calculated from the date of
diagnosis to the earliest of death from prostate cancer, death from
nonprostate cancer causes, and the censoring date (April 30, 2005). Deaths
from nonprostate cancer causes were treated as independent censoring
events. All men diagnosed with prostate cancer (n = 1,891) were included in

analyses of baseline serum biomarkers, but only those diagnosed after 3 y
(n = 1,557) were included in analyses with serum biomarkers at 3 y. Baseline
descriptive characteristics are presented as means (continuous variables) or
proportions (categorical variables) for prostate deaths and survivors and
compared using Student’s t test or m2 test. Survival was evaluated using
Kaplan-Meier survival plots and Cox proportional hazards regression
models for each quintile of serum a-tocopherol, h-carotene, and retinol
measured at baseline and 3 y. The quintile cut-points, which were estimated
from baseline analyte distributions in survivors, were 9.4, 10.9, 12.2, and
14.9 mg/L for a-tocopherol, 104, 155, 210, and 299 Ag/L for h-carotene, and
492, 554, 613, and 691 Ag/L for retinol. The quintile cut-points used to
classify serum a-tocopherol measured 3 y after accrual were 11.5, 13.5, 16.0,
and 19.0 mg/L. The proportional hazards assumption was tested by
examining Schoenfeld residuals and was upheld in all analyses. Adjusted
hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using
Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for age at

randomization, BMI, age at diagnosis, advanced stage at diagnosis, number
of years smoked, and serum cholesterol in a-tocopherol analyses, as it
affects bioavailability (24). To account for missing data, we adjusted stage at
diagnosis in three categories: (a) before September 2001 and stage I or II, (b)
before September 2001 and stage III or IV, and (c) after September 2001 or
missing. Additional covariates that were considered but not included were
daily number of cigarettes, age at smoking initiation, weight, height, family
history of prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, physical activity
(no activity or light-to-moderate work activity and more than or equal to
moderate leisure activity), urban residence, education, marital status, and
dietary intakes of protein, fat, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin C, and
lycopene. Effect modification was evaluated in stratified multivariate
analyses and also tested by adding product interaction terms and
comparing P values for the likelihood ratio tests (<0.05) for the models
with and without interaction terms. We examined whether the association
with survival differed by several factors, including treatment arm, BMI,

height, smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity, family history of
cancer, and self-reported dietary intake of alcohol, fish, red meat, dietary
fats, fruits, vegetables, and several micronutrients. All statistical tests were
two-sided and P values of V0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Data analyses were conducted using Stata (version SE 9, STATACorp).

Results
Of the 29,133 men enrolled in the ATBC Study, 1,891 were
diagnosed with prostate cancer during 1985 to 2005; 89 of these
diagnoses were made within 3 years of accrual. Of the 1,891 with
prostate cancer, 395 died from prostate cancer, 527 died from
nonprostate cancer causes, and 969 were alive on April 30, 2005.
Median follow-up time was 3.4 years (range, 0–15.8) for prostate
cancer deaths, compared with 4.1 years (range, 0–17.8) for those
who died from other causes or survived through the analysis period
(referred to here as ‘‘survivors’’). Comparisons of baseline
characteristics between those with fatal prostate cancer and
survivors are presented in Table 1. Overall, survivors were slightly
younger upon enrollment (mean, 57.9 versus 59.6 years), older upon
diagnosis (mean, 70.5 versus 68.2 years), and had a shorter smoking
history (35.7 versus 37.6 years). Survivors were also more likely to
be physically active (21% versus 14%), less likely to have advanced
prostate cancer at diagnosis (21% versus 69%), more likely to have
missing information on stage at diagnosis (47% versus 15%),
and also more likely to elect radical surgery (23% versus 4%).
In the intervention trial, those with fatal prostate cancer were
slightly more likely to have been assigned to the h-carotene only
group (31%), but there was no significant difference among
the other intervention groups (placebo, a-tocopherol only, or both
h-carotene and a-tocopherol). There were also no statistically

significant differences in baseline serum nutrient biomarkers
between groups.
Table 2 describes demographic, dietary, and biomarker characteristics for each quintile of baseline serum a-tocopherol. Men in
the higher quintiles of baseline serum a-tocopherol tended to be
more physically active, more likely to live in an urban residence,
and have more formal education than those in the lower quintiles.
Conversely, most of the self-reported dietary intakes examined
were significantly associated with the quintile of baseline serum
a-tocopherol. Vitamins C, D, and E, selenium, a-tocopherol,
h-carotene, polyunsaturated fat, a-linolenic acid, vegetables, fruits,
and fish were positively associated with baseline serum atocopherol quintiles, whereas saturated fat was inversely associated. Associations were similar for serum a-tocopherol measured at
3 years, although with some attenuation for vitamin C, selenium,
and h-carotene (data not shown). Serum baseline concentrations of
h-carotene, retinol, and total cholesterol were positively associated
with serum baseline concentrations of a-tocopherol, whereas
serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was inversely associated.
Although missing stage at diagnosis and radical surgery election
were more likely among survivors in Table 1, there was no
association with either factor and quintile of serum a-tocopherol
at baseline or 3 years.
Adjusted HRs for prostate cancer mortality were examined by
baseline serum a-tocopherol, h-carotene, and retinol (Table 3).
Higher baseline serum a-tocopherol was associated with improved
prostate cancer survival (P trend = 0.03). Neither serum h-carotene
nor retinol had a demonstrable effect. Those with a-tocopherol
levels above the second quintile at baseline, which corresponds to
concentrations of z10.9 mg/L, had a HR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.57–0.93),
which is suggestive of a possible threshold effect. Figure 1A shows

Vitamin E and Prostate Cancer Survival

a comparison of the survival curves for those in the top three
quintiles versus those in the bottom two quintiles.
Although there were no statistically significant interactions,
there seemed to be a considerable difference in survival by
a-tocopherol supplementation status (Table 4). Longer prostate
cancer survival was observed for those who received
a-tocopherol supplementation (either a-tocopherol only or atocopherol and h-carotene combined) and had higher serum
a-tocopherol at baseline (P trend = 0.04). The strongest relationship was seen for those who received a-tocopherol supplementation and were in the highest serum a-tocopherol quintile
(HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.20–0.90). Higher baseline serum h-carotene,
regardless of supplementation status, had no effect on prostate
cancer survival. We also restricted the analyses to those
receiving the single nutrient supplement to assess the whether
the combined a-tocopherol and h-carotene supplement acted
differently. The overall trend was the same; only those who
received a-tocopherol supplements had significantly improved
survival with the strongest effect seen for the highest serum atocopherol quintile (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11–0.74).

To examine possible trial effects seen elsewhere (25), survival
was also compared by supplementation status and the period of
time in which prostate cancer was diagnosed: during the
controlled trial (before May 1993), 6-year posttrial follow-up
(through April 30, 1999), and through April 30, 2005 (12-year
posttrial). The a-tocopherol supplementation death HRs were
0.60 (95% CI, 0.29–1.24) during the trial, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.38–1.30)
in the 6-year posttrial period, and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.43–2.25) in the
12-year posttrial period. For h-carotene, the corresponding HRs
were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.56–1.84), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.58–1.57), and 1.17
(95% CI, 0.57–2.39).
Prostate cancer survival was examined by quintile of serum
a-tocopherol measured 3 years into the study, after the onset of
supplementation (Table 5). The results were similar to those for
baseline measurements, with higher on-study a-tocopherol levels
being related to improved overall survival (P trend = 0.12),
particularly for cases in the highest quintile who were receiving
the a-tocopherol supplementation (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09–0.71).
However, the highest three quintiles did not have significantly
improved prostate cancer survival compared with the bottom
two quintiles (P = 0.52; Fig. 1B). Compared with a common
reference of no a-tocopherol supplementation/lowest serum
quintile, the only statistically significant association was poorer
survival for those in the lowest quintile and receiving supplementation (HR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.11–7.15). Although, cases in most other
categories experienced increased survival, the interaction test was
not significant.
Potential associations between prostate cancer survival and
treatment status; BMI; height; smoking status; alcohol use;
physical activity; and dietary intake of vitamins C, D, and E, fish,
fruits, vegetables, calcium, selenium, lycopene, total carotenoids,
a-linolenic acid, and polyunsaturated fat were also examined
(data not shown). Overall, none of these associations were
statistically significant, but there were trends toward greater
prostate cancer survival for men who were taller than 178 cm, with
a HR of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.56–1.02), and trends toward poorer survival
for men in the highest quartile of pack-years smoked, with HR of
1.30 (95% CI, 0.99–1.72).

Higher serum and supplemental a-tocopherol seemed to
improve overall prostate cancer survival in this investigation.
Overall, estimates were similar for the baseline and 3-year serum
a-tocopherol determinations, suggesting both dietary and
supplemental vitamin E may contribute to improved prostate
cancer survival. Baseline serum values reflect dietary intake as
men who reported taking supplements above minimum limits
upon enrollment were not eligible to participate in the trial,
whereas 3-year serum concentrations resulted from dietary
intake and the intervention supplementation. The strongest
survival associations were seen for men who received atocopherol supplementation and had high serum a-tocopherol
concentrations at baseline or 3 years, as well as during the first
6 years after the trial supplementation. Neither serum nor
supplemental h-carotene or serum retinol had apparent effects
on survival.
These findings build upon previous research showing a 41%
reduction of prostate cancer mortality in response to a-tocopherol
supplementation in the controlled trial component of the ATBC
Study from 1985 to 1993 (20). The data presented here included an

additional 12 years of follow-up. Our findings stand in contrast to
those recently reported for two large, randomized controlled
studies, the Physicians’ Health Study (PHS) II and the Selenium and
Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT). PHS II tested
vitamins C and E and found no effect of vitamin E supplementation
on prostate cancer mortality (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.64–1.58) or
incidence (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.85–1.09) after up to 10 years of
intervention (26). Similarly, SELECT tested selenium and vitamin E
in over 35,000 healthy men and resulted in a nonsignificant
increased rate of prostate cancer among the men receiving the
supplemental vitamin E (HR, 1.13; 99% CI, 0.95, 1.35) compared
with those receiving the vitamin E placebo (27). The dose of
vitamin E used in the PHS II was 400 IU synthetic a-tocopherol
every other day, half the effective daily dosage of 400 IU daily all
rac-a-tocopheryl acetate used in SELECT. Several factors could
account for these differing results. First, our analysis was based on

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

measured serum a-tocopherol, whereas PHS II and SELECT tested
and reported on their supplementation groups. The intervention
dose in the ATBC Study was 50 IU dl-a-tocopherol acetate per day,
4 to 8 times lower than the other trials and also had a longer period
of follow-up (up to 20 years). PHS II and SELECT evaluated much
higher dosages for shorter periods and have not yet reported on
prospectively measured vitamin E blood levels, which could reveal
a different association compared with the high-dose supplementation. Second, PHS II and SELECT were conducted in the United
States where prostate-specific antigen testing is common and those
enrolled in SELECT were required to undergo prostate cancer
screening before study entry in contrast to the ATBC Study. If
vitamin E affects advanced prostate cancer in particular, as has
been observed (8), then an unscreened population would likely
show a stronger beneficial relationship. Third, both recently
reported trials were composed of more diverse study populations

Vitamin E and Prostate Cancer Survival

with relatively few smokers compared with the ATBC Study
participants. It is possible that the survival benefit of vitamin E is
only experienced by smokers.
There are few other studies investigating vitamin E and prostate
cancer survival. Two studies included daily vitamin E supplements
within their interventions; one found improved survival in
combination with N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (27, 28) and
another concluded that a vegan diet with soy, fish oil, and several
micronutrient supplements delayed disease progression (29).
Although each study showed sizable effects, it is not possible to
distinguish the contribution of supplemental vitamin E from the
other dietary intervention components. However, dietary agents
have been shown to affect prostate cancer survival. An investigation within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study examined
prediagnostic and postdiagnostic diet and found high intake of
tomato sauce (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38–0.82) and fish (HR, 0.73; 95%
CI, 0.52–1.02) were protective against disease progression (14). As
prostate cancer is a disease with relatively good survival, there is

interest in other causes of death in men diagnosed with prostate
cancer. We found a trend toward protection for all-cause mortality
(including prostate cancer; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.87 for highest
versus lowest quintile; P trend = 0.01), which was slightly attenuated
when those who died of prostate cancer were excluded (HR, 0.70;
95% CI, 0.46–0.98 for highest versus lowest quintile; P trend = 0.11),
suggesting a possible effect for a-tocopherol on other causes of
death in men with prostate cancer. Although meta-analyses suggest
vitamin E has no effect on all-cause mortality (30), lower mortality
rates were observed for men with higher serum vitamin E at
baseline in another analysis within the ATBC data (31).
There is considerably more evidence available for the relationship between vitamin E and prostate cancer risk than for survival.
Several, but not all, observational and intervention studies have
shown a strong inverse association between a-tocopherol and the
risk of developing prostate cancer, particularly for advanced
cancers or among smokers (32). For example, analysis from the
Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian trial found no association

with risk in the general population, but vitamin E was strongly
protective in smokers (relative risk, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12–0.68; ref. 10).
Similar work using the ATBC Study with 19 years of follow-up
found that serum a-tocopherol was associated with reduced risk of
prostate cancer (relative risk, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66–0.96 for highest
versus lowest quintile), especially advanced disease (relative risk,
0.56; 95% CI, 0.36–0.85; ref. 8), whereas the original effect seen in
the trial period of the study was a 32% reduction in prostate cancer
risk with a-tocopherol supplementation (20). New observational
studies are needed to tease apart the relationship between prostate
cancer risk and a-tocopherol from supplementation versus serum
levels as well as the possible interactions with smoking. Similar
investigations are needed to determine the role of nutritional
factors in prostate cancer survival.
The mechanisms through which vitamin E might affect the
development and progression of prostate cancer are not fully
understood; however, a number of biologically plausible pathways
have been suggested. a-Tocopherol is thought to affect carcinogenesis by detoxifying oxidizing radicals via its antioxidant
properties, inducing cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells (33),
decreasing cell growth by down-regulating the phosphoinositide
3-kinase pathway (34), enhancing cell-mediated immunity (16),
targeting transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-nB, that
contribute to malignant transformation and cell growth (35), and
decreasing serum androgen concentrations (36). Many of these
biological actions are likely to be involved in prostate cancer
survival.
Prostate cancer survival was greater for men with baseline
serum a-tocopherol of z11 mg/L, regardless of supplementation
status, but there was slightly better survival for those receiving
the vitamin E supplementation (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.27–0.96).
Similar results were seen after 3 years among those in the highest
a-tocopherol quintiles who received supplementation had considerably better survival (HR, 0.29–95% CI, 0.10–0.82). Vitamin E
supplementation has been associated with decreased prostate
cancer risk in several cohort studies, which reflects self-selected
supplement use rather than randomized assignment in an
intervention trial. Long-term (10 years average) supplement use
of vitamin E (z400 IU) was associated with the reduced risk of
advanced prostate cancers (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19–1.00) in the
VITamins And Lifestyle cohort study (37). A similar nonsignificant
trend was seen for advanced cases in nonsmokers but not current
or former smokers in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a large
cohort study of men ages 50 to 71 years; however, supplemental
vitamin E intake was unrelated to prostate cancer risk in the total
population (7). Other recent analyses suggest possible harm from
such supplements (38, 39). Our analyses suggest that both dietary
vitamin E, as evidenced by baseline levels, and supplemental
vitamin E as reflected in on-study serum concentrations at 3 years,
affected survival favorably.
When all categories of serum a-tocopherol at 3 years and
supplementation were compared with men in the lowest quintile
without supplementation, there seemed to be a nonsignificant trend
with better survival in the highest quintiles. Unexpectedly, however,
the poorest survival was seen for men in the lowest quintile of serum
a-tocopherol who had received supplementation, and not all men
who received supplements were in the higher a-tocopherol quintiles
at 3 years, although supplemental vitamin E contributes much more
to biochemical status than do dietary sources (40). It is important to
note that there were very few participants (n = 27, including 5 cases)
in this category, however, and the finding could be due to chance. It is

also foreseeable that less healthy men may be less likely to take
supplements, yet compliance, as measured by capsule adherence
and number of visits, was no different for these 27 participants than
the general study population. Finally, it is possible that these men
may be more likely to have a genetic polymorphism that is related to
both survival and vitamin E metabolism. Vitamin E levels have been
shown to modify prostate cancer risk for polymorphisms in
magnanese-superoxide dismutase and XRCC1, for example, with
stronger associations seen for aggressive cancers (41–43). At present,
genotyping data to test this hypothesis are not available for all cases.
Our findings that serum h-carotene and retinol were unrelated
to prostate cancer survival mirror other observational and
intervention studies that generally found no association with
either nutrient and prostate cancer risk (9, 44). Results for
h-carotene and prostate cancer risk have been inconsistent. There
was no association detected in the Physicians Health Study
(relative risk, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9–1.1; ref. 45), a randomized trial of
aspirin and 50 mg h-carotene on alternate days, but h-carotene
was associated with an increased risk of aggressive prostate
cancer in a nested case-control study using data from the Prostate,
Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Trial (relative risk, 1.67; 95% CI,
1.03–2.72; ref. 46).
There are several notable strengths of this study. The availability
of a large number of prostate cancer cases with considerable
postdiagnosis follow-up provided substantial power to detect
potential associations with survival that may have been obscured
in smaller studies. The use of serum nutrient biomarkers reduces
the measurement error associated with self-reported data for
dietary and supplement intake. Participants were exceptionally
adherent during the trial period, with 96% of supplement capsules
taken as scheduled, and there was no off-trial supplement use
reported. Finally, because prostate-specific antigen screening was
not widely used at the time of the ATBC trial, the potential for
lead-time bias caused by overdiagnosis of cancers that are not
clinically relevant was low.
Limitations of the study include its being conducted in a relatively
homogeneous cohort of male Finnish smokers, which limits the
generalizability of our findings to nonsmokers and other races and
ethnicities. We did not have comprehensive data concerning
prostate cancer treatment; however, surgery was distributed equally
across categories of serum a-tocopherol (baseline and 3 years) and
supplementation status among those who died of prostate cancer.
Another limitation was lack of detailed data on stage and grade of
prostate cancer in those diagnosed after September 2001. However,
cross-tabulations of a-tocopherol levels by stage in those diagnosed
at or before September 2001 failed to reveal a correlation of
a-tocopherol levels with stage. Thus, stage is unlikely to confound
our results. Moreover, we adjusted stage and period of diagnosis in
three categories [(a) before September 2001 and stage I or II, (b)
before September 2001 and stage III or IV, and (c) after September
2001 or missing]. Gleason score, a strong predictor of survival, was
available only for cases diagnosed before May 1, 1993 (<10% of cases),
and thus, not included in these analyses. An examination of available
data showed that Gleason score was strongly associated with
survival as expected but was not associated with serum
a-tocopherol or h-carotene at either baseline or 3 years reducing
concerns about potential confounding. We did not have information
on serum levels or diet after 3 years on-study or posttrial supplement
use; thus, changes in diet or supplement use could have resulted in
misclassification that would have biased our results to toward the
null. This was an observational study of prostate cancer cases,

Vitamin E and Prostate Cancer Survival

although it was conducted within the ATBC cohort for a randomized
trial. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding
by unmeasured or unknown characteristics, especially clinicopathologic factors that may be related to survival, although we adjusted
for a number of potential confounders.
In summary, our results suggest dietary and supplemental
a-tocopherol may improve prostate cancer survival. Data from
similar studies in other populations would be useful. Considering
the large number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer, such
nutritional modifications could have a significant effect if
subsequent randomized trials in men with newly diagnosed
prostate cancer prove a benefit.
