BACKGROUND. The purine analogs pentostatin and cladribine have revolutionized
the treatment of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) with overall responses in greater than
85% of patients and a median progression-free survival of up to 15 years. They
continue to be effective at second- and even third-line therapy; however, alternative treatments are needed for patients who are or have become refractory to
these agents or whose remissions are shorter with each course of therapy.

METHODS. The authors conducted a retrospective review of 8 patients who
received pentostatin or cladribine combined concurrently (n 5 6 patients) or
sequentially (n 5 2 patients) with rituximab at second-line therapy (n 5 3
patients) and at subsequent lines of therapy (n 5 5 patients). Results from a pre-

airy cell leukemia (HCL) is an indolent disease that is highly responsive to the purine analogs 20 -deoxycoformycin (DCF) (pentostatin. Nipent; Supergen, Dublin, Calif) and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine
(2CdA) (cladribine, Leustatin; Ortho Biotech, Bridgewater, NJ), which
produce overall responses in > 85% of patients1–6 and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of up to 15 years.3,5 Nevertheless, a minority of patients fail to respond to primary purine analog therapy or
show short-lived responses with multiple recurrences. In addition,
there are growing numbers of patients who received treatment some
years ago who now have recurrent disease and are showing a lower
CR rate2,3,5,7–9 and shorter PFS5 at second- and third-line therapy
when they are treated only with single-agent purine analogs. There-

fore, several novel agents for treating HCL have been
investigated, including the monoclonal antibodies
rituximab (anti-CD20, Mabthera; Hoffman-La Roche,
Basel, Switzerland)10–17 and alemtuzumab (anti-CD52,
Campath; Berlex, Montville, NJ)18 and the immunotoxins BL22 (anti-CD22)19,20 and LMB-2 (anti-CD25).21 Efficacy of these agents has been reported in terms of
response rates, because follow-up has been too short
to compare survival data. The benefit of any novel
treatment in HCL will be demonstrated if it yields
results that are either equivalent and less toxic or
superior to the results obtained when patients receive
the standard treatment with pentostatin or cladribine
only.
Data concerning second-line and subsequent
treatments for HCL with purine analogs are scant.
Excluding our own results, to our knowledge,
reported series range from 5 to 59 evaluable patients at second-line therapy (total, 193 patients),
with overall response rates (ORR) from 83% to 100%
and complete response (CR) rates from 52% to
89%,2,3,7–9,22,23 from 2 to 9 patients at third-line
therapy (total, 20 patients), with a combined ORR of
85% and a combined CR rate of 55%.2,7,22,23 Recurrence rates and PFS from those series were reported
variously and cannot be compared.
The Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) study of 219
patients with HCL is one of the largest series with a
long follow-up (median, 12.5 years from diagnosis).5
It includes 73 patients who received second-line purine analog therapy, of whom 20 patients also went
on to receive third-line therapy. In addition, because
1) diagnoses were reviewed centrally to exclude
patients who had the variant form of HCL or splenic
marginal zone lymphoma; 2), both pentostatin and
cladribine were used with standard protocols and
response criteria; and 3) the outcomes of therapy
were in line with other published series, these
patients may be used as a control group against
which to assess novel agents. Results from this series
are shown in Table 1.
We and others have demonstrated that attainment
of high-quality remissions should be the objective in
treating patients with HCL.2,3,5 In an effort to improve
on our results and increase the patients’ chances of
obtaining a durable CR, we investigated the use of
pentostatin or cladribine in combination with rituximab at second-line and subsequent lines of therapy.
High expression of CD20 antigen on hairy cells,24,25
together with the synergy and safety of rituximab
when used in other B-cell disorders in combination
with chemotherapy (including pentostatin and cladribine),26–32 provided the rationale for the use of purine
analogs combined with rituximab in HCL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Diagnosis
HCL was diagnosed in accordance with World Health
Organization criteria. Peripheral blood counts and
morphology were used in conjunction with immunophenotyping of blood and/or bone marrow aspirates
and bone marrow and/or spleen tissues using immunohistochemistry. Immunophenotyping included
antibodies against CD25, CD11c, CD103, and CD123;
and, for immunohistochemistry, we used, among
other B- and T-cell antibodies, CD20, anti-DBA44,
and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP).
Patients
Eight patients (6 from the RMH series and 2 from
Siena) who developed recurrent disease after first-line
therapy (n 5 3 patients) or after subsequent lines of
therapy (n 5 5 patients) with single-agent pentostatin
or cladribine were retreated with 1 of these agents
with the addition of rituximab. This was a retrospective review of the data after treatment was completed
and was not a clinical trial. The patients were not
treated uniformly: Five patients received pentostatin,
and 3 patients received cladribine; 6 patients received
rituximab concurrently with the purine analog, and

2 patients received it sequentially. The 73 patients
with recurrent/refractory disease in our series who
were treated with single-agent purine analogs5 formed
a historic control group.

Therapies
Pentostatin was administered at a dose of 4 mg/m2
intravenously every 2 weeks until maximum
response; then, 2 more doses were given (in the absence of toxicity) to consolidate response. Cladribine
was given at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg per day either intravenously (Patients 6 and 8) or subcutaneously
(Patient 3) for 5 to 7 days (Table 2). Prophylaxis
against pneumocystis (septra/pentamidine) and/or
herpes virus (aciclovir) was given. Rituximab was
given intravenously at a dose of 375 mg/m2 concurrently with pentostatin every 2 weeks (Patients 1, 2,
4, and 7) or sequentially for 8 weekly doses, beginning 1 month after the completion of pentostatin

treatment (Patient 5). With cladribine, rituximab was
given weekly either from the start (Patients 6 and 8)
or from 2 months after the end (Patient 3) of cladribine treatment. A median of 7 doses (range, 4–8
doses) of rituximab were administered for all
patients.

Response
A CR was defined as morphologic absence of hairy
cells from blood and bone marrow biopsy with normalization and/or improved blood cell counts
(neutrophils > 1.5 3 109/L, hemoglobin 12g/dL for
men and 11 g/dL for women, and platelets
100 3 109/L) and no organomegaly. A partial
response (PR) was defined as a 50% improvement
in any of these criteria without meeting the criteria
for a CR. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was
assessed by using morphology and immunophenotyping of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow aspi-

rates and immunohistochemistry of bone marrow
trephine biopsies. In 2 patients, clonality for immunoglobulin H (IgH) rearrangement was assessed by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the BIOMED2 protocols and GeneScan assays33 with an ABI Prism
310 Genetic Analyzer (Applera Italia, Applied Biosystems, Milano, Italy). Three-color immunophenotyping was performed gating on CD19-positive cells and
analyzing coexpression of CD103/CD123, CD22 (intensity)/CD25, and CD20/CD11c. Samples were
described as MRD-negative if there were no detectable circulating hairy cells and no fluorescent activity
observed in the CD19/CD103/CD123 population.
Because persistent bone marrow fibrosis posttherapy
and hemodilute aspirates may limit the utility of bone
marrow aspirate assessment by morphology and flow
cytometry, immunohistochemistry was included in
assessing response and residual disease. According to
immunohistochemical standards, any clustering of
CD20- and/or DBA44-positive cells with hairy-cell
morphology was considered to demonstrate residual
disease (prerituximab therapy). After rituximab, a CR
(MRD-negative) was defined by the absence of
DBA44- and/or TRAP-positive cell clusters.

Statistical Analysis
PFS and recurrence rates were measured from the
start of treatment and were estimated by using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Analyses were performed
using the Statistica software package (StatSoft, Tulsa,
Okla).

RESULTS
Eight patients (6 men and 2 women) received salvage
combination therapy with a purine analog and rituximab at a median of 9 years (range, 2–23 years) from
diagnosis (Table 2). The median age at the start of
this combination therapy was 55 years (range, 32–69
years). All patients were pretreated and had received
between 1 and 4 previous courses of purine analogs
and between 2 and 7 courses of any previous therapy, including vincristine with cyclophosphamide
and prednisolone, a-interferon, splenectomy, and
single-agent rituximab. This was a particularly resistant cohort: Only 3 of these 8 patients had previously
achieved a CR (2 patients had achieved a CR twice),
and the median PFS after a CR was only 85 months
(range, 28–111 months). Patient 4, who had the
shortest first-line CR, obtained only a PR at secondline therapy (duration, 17 months) despite a repeated
course of cladribine at 5 months and single-agent
rituximab after another 5 months, and thus demonstrated active, refractory disease. The other 5 patients

2243

had between 1 and 4 PRs each with a median PFS of
24 months (range, 9–48 months). Thus, 6 patients
had only limited, short-lived responses to singleagent purine analogs. Large hairy cells with nucleoli
and blastic morphology were observed in the bone
marrow biopsies from 2 patients (Patients 4 and 7).
All 8 patients responded to therapy. There were 7
CRs, all of which were MRD-negative (assessed by
immunohistochemistry), and there was 1 PR (Patient
4). In Patient 5, the use of sequential rituximab after
12 courses of pentostatin converted a PR (residual
15% bone marrow infiltration) into a CR (MRD-negative). Molecular analysis did not reveal a clonal rearrangement of IgH in the 2 patients who were
assessed by PCR; therefore, this result was consistent
with MRD negativity. In all patients, response quality
was equivalent (n 5 3 patients) or superior (n 5 5
patients) to the response achieved with the previous
course of therapy. At a median follow-up of 29
months (range, 5–39 months), all 7 patients who
achieved a CR remained in remission. Follow-up was
too short in 5 of 8 patients to compare PFS with that
from previous courses; however, 2 patients (Patients
7 and 1) had longer PFS compared with their previous maximum (by 3 months and 25 months, respectively). Only 1 patient developed recurrent disease
(Patient 4, refractory) after a PR that lasted 10
months (18 months short of his previous maximum
PFS). Both patients who received sequential rituximab therapy (Patients 3 and 5) were among those
who attained an MRD-negative CR, and both
remained in remission at 7 months and 34 months,
respectively.
The overall response and CR rates, together with
the recurrence rates at 2 years, are summarized in
Table 3. Comparing the results in these 8 patients
with those from our published series5 of 73 patients
with recurrent/refractory disease who were treated
with single-agent purine analogs (Table 1), there was
evidence of benefit. Among patients at the time of
second-line therapy, the CR rate was 100% (n 5 3
patients) versus 70% (n 5 73 patients) in the historic
control group. The CR rate at the third, fourth, and
fifth lines of therapy was 80% (n 5 5 patients) versus
45% (n 5 20 patients) in the historic control group at
third-line therapy alone. All 8 patients had equivalent
or improved responses compared with their previous
line of therapy compared with only 81% of the control group. The recurrence rate at 2 years was 20%.
This also suggested a benefit compared with the control group, with a recurrence rate of 0% (only 1
patient assessable to date) versus 15% by 2 years after second-line therapy and 25% (1 of 4 patients) versus 33% after third- and fourth-line therapy. The

median PFS had not been reached at the time of last

Toxicity was minimal, with only 1 reported significant adverse event—asymptomatic eosinophilia—
which resolved spontaneously after a brief discontinuation of rituximab. One patient in this cohort died
3 years later (Patient 4; PR) because of refractory,
progressive disease.

DISCUSSION
Despite the success of pentostatin and cladribine in
treating HCL, PFS curves have revealed no plateau in
long-term follow-up studies,5,9,22 and patients have
developed recurrent disease at up to 17 years.5 In
addition, there is a small subset of patients with
more resistant disease who have either a multiply
recurring course or, rarely, primarily refractory disease. The presence of large cells with blastic morphology has been recognized in this aggressive
phenotype.34
The optimal salvage therapy for such patients
has not been resolved. Randomized controlled trials
are difficult given the rarity of the disease and the
prolonged follow-up needed. Treatment with the alternative purine analog, or even with the same agent
again, can be effective particularly if initial responses
were long-lasting. CR rates, however, are lower with
each successive course of therapy, and remissions
are less durable.2,3,5,7–9 Moreover, although purine
analogs generally are safe and well tolerated, toxicity
from them may be a problem, largely because of
immunosuppression related to T-cell lymphopenia.
Exposure to multiple sequential courses of these
agents increases the risk of prolonged immunosuppression.

The chimeric anti-CD20 antibody rituximab is
established widely in the treatment of B-cell disorders. It acts by both complement- and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and by blocking
signaling pathways to induce apoptosis.6 Hairy cells
highly express CD2024,25 and, thus, are an ideal target
for rituximab. The use of single-agent rituximab in
patients with multiply recurrent HCL was described
first in 3 case reports.10–12 Subsequent studies have
confirmed the efficacy of single-agent rituximab
given as a weekly infusion of 375 mg/m2 for 4 weeks
in treating patients with recurrent/refractory HCL.
Overall response rates from 25% to 64% with CR
rates from 13% to 55% have been reported.12–14 In 1
study, extended treatment of 8–12 weeks was given
and resulted in a response rate of 80% and a CR rate
of 53%.15
Although none of the studies of single-agent
rituximab demonstrated a superior benefit compared
with the purine analogs in terms of the response
rate, advantages of this agent include its safety, tolerability, and nonoverlapping mechanism of action.
Because rituximab does not lead to long-term bone
marrow hypoplasia, it may be an ideal agent for
patients who have poor bone marrow reserves after
multiple previous therapies. In addition, the B-cell
depletion-induced immunosuppression observed
with rituximab is less profound and shorter than the
T-cell-related immunosuppression induced by the
purine analogs.35–37
Cervetti et al. treated 10 patients with HCL by
using rituximab at a median of 5.7 months (range, 3–
70 months) after the end of cladribine induction
therapy.16 Of 8 evaluable patients in their study, 2
patients already were in CR, but a PR or nonresponse
to cladribine was converted into a CR in the other 6
patients. Toxicity was very mild, and 5 of the 8
patients were MRD-negative after 12 months.
Ravandi et al. investigated treatment with cladribine
followed 1 month later by 8 weekly doses of rituximab in 12 newly diagnosed patients and 1 previously
treated patient.17 All of those patients achieved a CR.
There was no unexpected toxicity, and no further
declines were observed in the absolute numbers of
CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes after the initiation of
rituximab therapy. Eleven of 12 evaluable patients in
that study had no residual disease detectable by
PCR, and none had developed recurrent disease at a
median follow-up of 14 months (range, 6–16
months).17 Except for the 1 previously treated patient
in this series, to our knowledge, there are no other
reports of rituximab in combination with purine
analogs used at second-line or subsequent lines of
therapy.

Rituximab in Recurrent HCL/Else et al.

Our findings support the safety of combining
rituximab with purine analogs. Furthermore, the current results provide evidence of an added benefit
over single-agent purine analogs when this combination is used in patients with recurrent/refractory
HCL at second-line therapy and at subsequent lines
of therapy. In 2 patients (Patients 4 and 7), large cells
with blastic morphology heralded an aggressive and
advanced status of disease. Despite this, Patient 7
achieved a CR and remained in remission at 39
months. Patients 4 and 8 had failed to respond to
rituximab as a single agent (4 doses) but, respectively, achieved a PR after 4 doses of rituximab combined with pentostatin (at third-line therapy) and an
MRD-negative CR after 8 doses of rituximab with cladribine (at fifth-line therapy). The use of rituximab
for both first-line and recurrent/refractory HCL with
a greater number of doses than in previous studies
establishes it as a very effective compound for eradicating hairy cells because of their high expression of
CD20. The synergistic role of chemotherapy with
rituximab parallels reports in other B-cell disorders.
Although the numbers were too small to draw firm
conclusions, the overall response, CR, and 2-year recurrence rates in these 8 combination-treated
patients were superior to those achieved in our published retrospective report of second-line therapy
and subsequent treatments with purine analogs
alone (compare Table 1 with Table 3). All 8 patients
who were included in the current study had
responses to therapy that were either equivalent or
superior to the responses they attained at the previous line of therapy. Moreover, the 87.5% CR rate in
these multiply treated patients was higher than that
achieved with single-agent purine analogs at secondline therapy (70%) and was much higher than that
achieved at third-line therapy (45%).
MRD may be present in patients who attain a
clinical CR by standard criteria. MRD can be
detected in bone marrow by immunohistochemical
staining or in blood or bone marrow aspirates either
by sensitive immunophenotypic analysis (flow cytometry) or by PCR. An association between positive
MRD status and shorter PFS has been suggested but
has not been established firmly in HCL.7,16,17,38–44 As
was demonstrated in Patient 5 from the current
study, rituximab can eliminate MRD remaining after
purine analog treatment and, thus, potentially may
delay disease recurrence.16,17 Despite the limited
quality and duration of response to previous lines of
therapy observed in most of these patients, 7 of
8 patients attained an MRD-negative CR; and, to
date, none of those 7 patients has developed recurrent disease.

2245

Experience in other B-cell disorders,26–32 together
with the results reported by Cervetti et al. and
Ravandi et al.,16,17 suggest that the addition of rituximab to purine analog therapy in patients with newly
diagnosed HCL may be expected to improve CR rates
and induce MRD negativity. It is likely that longer
remissions will result.2,3,5,38–44 In settings in which
the additional cost burden is an issue, it is not yet
clear whether rituximab can be justified with firstline therapy in all patients given the good quality
and long duration of most responses. The identification of patients who have a poor prognosis may
help, although current information on prognostic
factors is scant (for review, see Dearden and Else44).
Rituximab should be considered in newly diagnosed
patients who fail to attain a CR after purine analogs,
although it may be too late for best effect. Byrd
et al.29 reported a higher CR rate (47%) in patients
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who received
rituximab concurrently with fludarabine compared
with patients who received it sequentially (28%);
although, at a median follow-up of 43 months, the
PFS and overall survival rates were similar for the 2
groups.45 We observed no difference in outcome
between the 6 patients who received rituximab concurrently and the 2 patients who received it sequentially, but these numbers were too small to draw any
inference. Rituximab certainly should be considered
in patients with recurrent disease, particularly those
who have short remissions.
In conclusion, we have analyzed the results from
a small series of patients with recurrent/refractory
HCL who received treatment with rituximab in combination with either pentostatin or cladribine at second-line therapy and at subsequent lines of therapy
(Table 3). By comparing these with the results from
our series of patients with HCL who received multiple treatments with pentostatin and/or cladribine as
a baseline for comparison (Table 1), we have demonstrated at least equivalent efficacy and safety. Moreover, the current results suggest evidence of an
added benefit compared with single-agent purine
analog therapy. Longer follow-up and the addition of
more patients will be needed to confirm this benefit.
Further prospective studies also may identify subsets
of patients that are most likely to benefit from rituximab and establish its ideal timing in relation to
purine analogs.
