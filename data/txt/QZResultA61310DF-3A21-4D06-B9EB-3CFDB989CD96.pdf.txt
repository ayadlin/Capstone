Abstract
The molecular mechanism by which epidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI)
induce apoptosis in non–small cell-lung cancer (NSCLC) cells that are positive for activating mutations of the
EGFR remains unclear. In this study, we report the effects of the EGFR-TKI gefitinib on expression of the
antiapoptotic protein survivin that have functional consequences in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells.
Immunoblot analysis revealed that gefitinib downregulated survivin expression, likely through inhibition of the
PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, in NSCLC cells positive for EGFR mutation. Stable overexpression of survivin
attenuated gefitinib-induced apoptosis and also inhibited the antitumor effect of gefitinib in human tumor
xenografts. Furthermore, the combination of survivin overexpression with inhibition of the gefitinib-induced
upregulation of the proapoptotic protein BIM attenuated gefitinib-induced apoptosis to a greater extent than
either approach alone. Our results indicate that downregulation of survivin plays a pivotal role in gefitinibinduced apoptosis in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells. Furthermore, they suggest that simultaneous
interruption of the PI3K-AKT-survivin and MEK-ERK-BIM signaling pathways is responsible for EGFR-TKI–
induced apoptotic death in these cells. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10402–10. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)
family of proteins and has been shown to inhibit caspases
and to prevent caspase-mediated cell death (1–3). Survivin is
abundant in many types of cancer cells but not in the
corresponding normal cells (4, 5). In nonmalignant proliferating cells, the expression of survivin is regulated in a cell
cycle-dependent manner (6, 7). The upregulation of survivin
expression in tumors does not seem to be dependent solely
on the cell cycle, however, given that it occurs in tumor cells
that are not actively cycling (4, 8, 9). Indeed, growth factors
have been found to regulate survivin expression in endothelial cells and neuroblastoma cells (10, 11). Although expression of survivin has been demonstrated in non–small celllung cancer (NSCLC; refs. 12–14), the mechanism by which
such expression is regulated in NSCLC cells has remained
unknown.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor
tyrosine kinase that is abnormally amplified or activated in a
variety of tumors including NSCLC, and it has therefore been
identified as an important target in cancer treatment (15–17).
Inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR (EGFR-TKI),
which compete with ATP for binding to the tyrosine kinase
pocket of the receptor, have been extensively studied in
patients with NSCLC (18, 19). Several prospective clinical
trials have revealed marked antitumor activity of EGFR-TKIs
in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations. The therapeutic
benefit of these drugs is much greater than that historically
observed with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced
NSCLC. NSCLC cells with EGFR mutations manifest activation
of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)–AKT and MEK–
ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signaling pathways
under the control of EGFR, and exposure of such cells to
EGFR-TKIs blocks signaling by both pathways and induces
apoptosis (20–22). The precise molecular mechanism by
which EGFR-TKIs induce apoptosis has remained unclear,
however. We have therefore now examined the effect of the
EGFR-TKI gefitinib on survivin expression as well as further
investigated the mechanism of gefitinib-induced apoptosis
in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
The human NSCLC cell lines PC9, HCC827, NCI-H1975
(H1975), A549, and H1299 were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection. The NSCLC line PC9/ZD was obtained as

described previously (23). All cells were cultured under a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 C in RPMI 1640
medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Gefitinib was obtained from Kemprotec, U0126 and LY294002
were from Cell Signaling Technology and BEZ235 and
AZD6244 were from ShangHai Biochempartner.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in
a solution containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/
L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmol/L sodium
pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and
leupeptin (1 mg/mL). The protein concentration of the cell
lysates was determined with the use of the Bradford reagent
(Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were subjected to
SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then exposed
to 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature
before incubation overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies.
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human phosphorylated EGFR
(pY1068), to XIAP, to phosphorylated and total AKT, to
phosphorylated and total ERK, to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), to caspase-3, and to BIM were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology; those to survivin were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; those to cIAP-1 were from R&D Systems; and
those to b-actin were from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to EGFR were obtained from Invitrogen. All antibodies
were used at a 1:1,000 dilution, with the exception of those to
b-actin (1:200). The nitrocellulose membrane was then
washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 before incubation for 1 hour at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit (Sigma) or mouse
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) immunoglobulin G. Immune complexes were finally detected with chemiluminescence reagents
(Perkin-Elmer Life Science).

analyzed for fluorescence with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur) and Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson).

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, fixed with 70%
methanol, washed again with PBS, and stained with propidium iodide (0.05 mg/mL) in a solution containing 0.1%
Triton X-100, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, and RNase A (0.05 mg/mL).
The stained cells were then analyzed for DNA content with
a flow cytometer and Modfit software (Verity Software
House).
Establishment of cells stably overexpressing survivin
A full-length cDNA fragment encoding human survivin was
obtained from HCC827 cells by reverse transcription and PCR
with the primers survivin-forward (50 -GCGGCCGCGGCGGCATGGGTGCCCCGACGTTG-30 ) and survivin-reverse (50 -GGATCCTCAATCCATGGCAGCCAGCTGCTCG-30 ). The amplification product was verified by sequencing after its cloning
into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The survivin
cDNA was excised from pCR-Blunt II-TOPO and transferred to
the pQCXIH retroviral vector (Clontech). Retroviruses encoding survivin were then produced and used to infect PC9 and
HCC827 cells as described (24). Cells stably expressing survivin
were then isolated by selection with hygromycin at 300 mg/mL
(Invivogen).

Gene silencing
Cells were plated at 50% to 60% confluence in 6-well plates
or 25-cm2 flasks and then incubated for 24 hours before
transient transfection for the indicated times with small
interfering RNAs (siRNA) mixed with the Lipofectamine
reagent (Invitrogen). The siRNAs specific for AKT (AKT-1,
50 -CCAGGUAUUUUGAUGAGGA-30 ; AKT-2, 50 -CAACCGCCAUCCAGACUGU-30 ), survivin (survivin-1, 50 -GAAGCAGUUUGAAGAAUUA-30 ; survivin-2, 50 -AGAAGCAGUUUGAAGAAUU-30 ), or BIM (BIM-1, 50 -GGAGGGUAUUUUUGAAUAA-30 ) mRNAs as well as corresponding scrambled
(control) siRNAs were obtained from Nippon EGT.

Growth inhibition assay in vivo
All animal studies were performed in accordance with the
Recommendations for Handling of Laboratory Animals for
Biomedical Research compiled by the Committee on Safety
and Ethical Handling Regulations for Laboratory Animal
Experiments, Kinki University (Osaka, Japan). The ethical
procedures followed conformed to the guidelines of the United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Prevention
Research. Tumors cells (5  106) were injected subcutaneously
into the axilla of 5- to 6-week-old female athymic nude mice
(BALB/c nu/nu; CLEA Japan). Treatment was initiated when
tumors in each group of 6 mice achieved an average volume of
200 to 400 mm3. Treatment groups consisted of vehicle control
and gefitinib (10 or 25 mg/kg). Gefitinib was administered by
oral gavage daily for 4 weeks, with control animals receiving a
0.5% (w/v) aqueous solution of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
as vehicle. Tumor volume was determined from caliper measurements of tumor length (L) and width (W) according to the
formula LW2/2. Both tumor size and body weight were measured twice per week.

Annexin V binding assay
The binding of Annexin V to cells was measured with the
use of an Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining Kit (Roche). Cells were
harvested by exposure to trypsin-EDTA, washed with PBS, and
centrifuged at 200  g for 5 minutes. The cell pellets were
resuspended in 100 mL of Annexin-V-FLUOS labeling solution,
incubated for 10 to 15 minutes at 15 C to 25 C, and then

Statistical analysis
Quantitative data are presented as means  SE from 3
independent experiments or for 6 animals per group unless
indicated otherwise. The significance of differences in the
percentage of Annexin V-positive cells was evaluated with the
unpaired 2-tailed Student's t test. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

were incubated in complete medium and in the presence of the indicated concentrations of gefitinib for 24 hours. Cell lysates were then prepared

b-actin (loading control). Data are representative of 3 independent experiments.

Results
Gefitinib downregulates survivin expression in EGFR
mutation-positive NSCLC cell lines
We first examined the effects of the EGFR-TKI gefitinib on
the expression of IAP family members in a subset of NSCLC
cell lines (PC9, HCC827, PC9/ZD, H1975, A549, and H1299) by
immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1). PC9 and HCC827 cells harbor an
EGFR allele with an activating mutation, whereas A549 and
H1299 cells express wild-type EGFR and PC9/ZD and H1975
cells harbor an EGFR allele with both an activating mutation
and a mutation (T790M) that confers resistance to EGFRTKIs. In PC9 and HCC827 cells, gefitinib induced the dephosphorylation of EGFR and reduced the abundance of survivin in
a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, in cells
expressing wild-type EGFR or harboring the T790M resistance
mutation, gefitinib did not affect the phosphorylation level of
EGFR or the expression of survivin. The expression of other
IAP family members, including XIAP and cIAP-1, was not
substantially affected by gefitinib in any of the cell lines
examined. These data thus showed that gefitinib downregulated survivin expression in NSCLC cells with an activating
mutation of EGFR.
Inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway results in survivin
downregulation in EGFR mutation–positive cells
To identify the signaling pathway (or pathways) responsible for downregulation of survivin by gefitinib, we exam-

ined the effects of specific inhibitors of MEK (U0126 and
AZD6244) and PI3K (LY294002 and BEZ235) in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells (PC9 and HCC827). Each of the
PI3K inhibitors reduced the abundance of survivin, whereas
the MEK inhibitors had no such effect (Fig. 2A), suggesting
that the regulation of survivin expression is mediated by
PI3K rather than by MEK in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC
cells. Given that the protein kinase AKT is an important
downstream target of PI3K, we examined whether the PI3Kdependent survivin expression is also dependent on AKT.
Depletion of AKT by transfection of cells with 2 different
siRNAs specific for AKT mRNA (AKT-1 and AKT-2 siRNA)
resulted in downregulation of survivin expression in both
PC9 and HCC827 cells (Fig. 2B). These results thus suggested
that gefitinib might regulate survivin expression through
inhibition of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in EGFR
mutation–positive NSCLC cells.
Knockdown of survivin expression induces apoptosis in
EGFR mutation–positive cells
To investigate whether downregulation of survivin by gefitinib is related to gefitinib-induced apoptosis, we transfected
PC9 or HCC827 cells with 2 independent siRNA specific for
survivin mRNA (survivin-1 and survivin-2 siRNAs). Depletion
of survivin resulted in generation of the cleaved forms of both
caspase-3 and PARP in both cell lines (Fig. 3A). Staining with
Annexin V also revealed that the proportion of apoptotic cells
was markedly increased by transfection with the survivin

BEZ235 (0.2 mmol/L), U0126 (20 mmol/L), or AZD6244 (0.2 mmol/L) for
24 hours, after which cell lysates were prepared and subjected to

forms of AKT or ERK, to survivin, or to b-actin. B, Cells were transfected (or
not) with 2 different AKT (AKT-1 or AKT-2) or scrambled (control)

siRNAs (Fig. 3B). In addition, depletion of survivin resulted in
an increase in the size of the sub-G1 (apoptotic) cell population, as revealed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3C). These data
suggested that downregulation of survivin induces apoptosis
in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells.
Overexpression of survivin inhibits gefitinib-induced
apoptosis in EGFR mutation–positive cells in vitro
To examine further the role of survivin in gefitinibinduced apoptosis, we established PC9 and HCC827 sublines
(PC9S7, PC9S8, HCC827S6, and HCC827S7) that stably overexpress survivin as a result of retroviral infection. The
abundance of survivin in these sublines was substantially
greater than that in cells infected with the empty virus (PC9Mock and HCC827-Mock; Fig. 4A). In addition, gefitinib
markedly reduced the level of survivin expression in PC9Mock and HCC827-Mock cells but not in the corresponding
sublines overexpressing survivin (Fig. 4B). Immunoblot ana-

lysis of the cleaved forms of caspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 4B) as
well as staining with Annexin V (Fig. 4C) also revealed that
overexpression of survivin resulted in marked inhibition of
gefitinib-induced apoptosis. Examination of the effect of
gefitinib on cell cycle distribution revealed that gefitinib
increased the proportion of cells in G0–G1 phase and
reduced that in S phase at 24 hours in a manner independent
of survivin overexpression (Fig. 4D). The survivin-overexpressing sublines, however, showed a smaller time-dependent increase in the size of the sub-G1 cell population than
did cells infected with the empty virus. These results thus
further indicated that downregulation of survivin by gefitinib contributes to the proapoptotic action of this drug in
EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells.
Overexpression of survivin inhibits the antitumor effect
of gefitinib on EGFR mutation–positive cells in vivo
To investigate whether the antitumor effect of gefitinib on
EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells might be affected by
survivin overexpression in vivo, we injected HCC827-Mock
cells or cells of the survivin-overexpressing subline HCC827S7
into nude mice for elicitation of the formation of solid tumors.
When the tumors became palpable (200–400 mm3), mice were
divided into 3 groups and treated with vehicle (control) or
gefitinib at a daily dose of 10 or 25 mg/kg by oral gavage for 4
weeks. Gefitinib treatment at either dose eradicated tumors in
mice injected with HCC827-Mock cells (Fig. 5A and C). In
contrast, tumors in mice injected with survivin-overexpressing cells were not eradicated by gefitinib even at the dose of
25 mg/kg per day, although tumor growth was partially
inhibited by gefitinib in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B
and C). These results showed that survivin overexpression
inhibits the antitumor effect of gefitinib on EGFR mutation–
positive NSCLC cells in vivo.
Effect of attenuation of BIM induction on gefitinibinduced apoptosis in EGFR mutation–positive cells
overexpressing survivin
Survivin overexpression did not completely eliminate gefitinib-induced apoptosis in PC9 and HCC827 cells, suggesting
that other signaling pathways might contribute to this process. Induction of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein BIM has
been found to be important for EGFR-TKI–induced apoptosis
in EGFR mutation–positive lung cancers, and inhibition of the
EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is required for BIM induction (25–27). We therefore examined whether survivin overexpression in combination with specific inhibition of BIM
induction results in an additive antiapoptotic effect in EGFR
mutation–positive NSCLC cells. We transiently transfected
survivin-overexpressing sublines of PC9 or HCC827 cells with
an siRNA specific for BIM mRNA. Transfection with the BIM
siRNA specifically inhibited the induction of BIM expression
by gefitinib in both mock-infected and survivin-overexpressing sublines (Fig. 6A). Staining with Annexin V further
revealed that the combination of survivin overexpression
and attenuation of BIM induction resulted in a greater level
of inhibition of gefitinib-induced apoptosis than that observed
with either approach alone (Fig. 6B). These data were

confirmed with a second BIM siRNA to rule out off-target
effects (Supplementary Fig. 1). These results thus suggested
that both survivin downregulation and BIM induction contribute independently to gefitinib-induced apoptosis in EGFR
mutation–positive NSCLC cells.

Discussion
EGFR-TKIs induce marked clinical responses in patients
with NSCLC positive for activating mutations of EGFR (1–3). In
vitro experiments have shown that EGFR-TKIs induce a substantial level of apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines expressing
mutant EGFRs (4). However, the key downstream mediators

10406

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

of EGFR-TKI–induced apoptosis in EGFR mutation–positive
cells have remained unidentified. We have now found that
gefitinib downregulated survivin expression in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC cells but not in NSCLC cells expressing
wild-type EGFR or EGFR with the T790M resistance mutation.
With the use of specific PI3K inhibitors and siRNAs specific for
AKT mRNA, we further showed that the downregulation of
survivin expression by gefitinib is likely mediated through
inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling. Human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)–targeting agents such as lapatinib
and trastuzumab were previously found to induce downregulation of survivin through inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway in breast cancer cells positive for HER2 amplification

(28, 29). Given that downregulation of survivin through inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway was induced by EGFR-TKIs in
EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells and by HER2-targeting
agents in breast cancer cells positive for HER2 amplification,
the expression of survivin is likely dependent on PI3K-AKT
signaling that operates downstream of receptor tyrosine
kinases and is essential for cell survival. This hypothesis is
further supported by the observation that transfection of
EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells with an siRNA specific

for EGFR mRNA resulted in marked inhibition of survivin
expression, whereas transfection of cells expressing wild-type
EGFR had no such effect (Supplementary Fig. 2). The PI3KAKT pathway has been implicated in the regulation of survivin
expression by cytokines, growth factors, and chemotherapeutic drugs (8, 10, 30). Although no direct correlation has been
established between downregulation of survivin and inhibition of EGFR signaling, these previous findings support the
notion that inhibition of the EGFR-PI3K-AKT pathway

contributes to downregulation of survivin expression by
EGFR-TKIs in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells.
Survivin has been implicated in resistance of cancer cells to
apoptosis, although the effect of survivin expression on gefitinib-induced apoptosis in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC
cells has not previously been examined. We have now shown
that survivin overexpression inhibited gefitinib-induced apoptosis in such cells. Inhibition of the PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK
pathways was previously found to account for much of the
proapoptotic activity of EGFR-TKIs in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells (31). We further found that overexpression of
survivin resulted in inhibition of apoptosis induced by a
combination of PI3K and MEK inhibitors in such cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). Increased AKT activity as a result either of
the loss of PTEN or of expression of a constitutively active

form of AKT was previously found to be associated with a
reduced sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR mutation–positive
NSCLC cells (32). However, the principal molecular target
underlying the response to inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling
by EGFR-TKIs has remained to be elucidated. In the present
study, we show that the sensitivity of EGFR mutation–positive
NSCLC cells to EGFR-TKIs depends, at least in part, on
survivin downregulation through inhibition of the PI3KAKT pathway. In our xenograft model, we showed that survivin overexpression inhibited the antitumor effect of gefitinib
on EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells. The extent of the
clinical benefit of EGFR-TKIs varies among NSCLC patients
harboring activating EGFR mutations, and the efficacy of these
drugs is limited by either de novo resistance or resistance
acquired after the onset of therapy (33). Although several

mechanisms of acquired resistance have been described, it
remains of clinical concern that molecular markers for
prediction of de novo resistance to these drugs have not been
well delineated (23, 34–38). It will therefore be of interest to
determine whether increased survivin expression in tumors is
clinically useful as a negative predictive marker of sensitivity
to EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR mutation–positive
NSCLC.
Our observations revealed that survivin overexpression did
not completely abolish gefitinib-induced apoptosis, suggesting that another proapoptotic regulator activated after EGFR
inhibition might contribute to EGFR-TKI–induced apoptotic
cell death. Previous studies have shown that gefitinib induces
BIM expression via inhibition of the MEK-ERK pathway and
that BIM induction plays a key role in EGFR-TKI–induced
apoptosis in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells (25–27). We
have now shown that inhibition of both survivin downregulation and BIM induction attenuated gefitinib-induced apoptosis to a greater extent than did inhibition of either process
alone. The recent preclinical study showing that the combination of a PI3K inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor, but neither agent
alone, induced substantial growth inhibition in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC cells (31) supports the notion that both
the PI3K-AKT-survivin and MEK-ERK-BIM pathways contri-

gefitinib-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we found that survivin
downregulation and BIM induction are independently
required for EGFR-TKI–induced apoptosis. Our results thus
show that simultaneous upstream interruption of the PI3KAKT-survivin and MEK-ERK-BIM pathways mediates EGFRTKI–induced apoptosis.
