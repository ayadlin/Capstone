BACKGROUND: Population-based studies have shown improved survival for patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer over time,
presumably because of the availability of new and more effective therapies. The objective of the current study was to determine whether
survival improved for patients who developed distant recurrence of breast cancer after receiving adjuvant therapy. METHODS: Adjuvant
chemotherapy trials coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group that accrued patients between 1978 and 2002 were reviewed.
Survival after distant disease recurrence was estimated for progressive time periods, and adjusted for baseline covariates in a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Of the 13,785 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy in 11 trials, 3447 (25%) developed distant disease recurrence; the median survival after recurrence was 20 months (95% confidence interval, 19 months-21 months). Factors associated
with inferior survival included a shorter distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI), estrogen receptor-negative and progesterone receptor-negative disease, the number of positive axillary lymph nodes present at the time of diagnosis, and black race (P < .0001 for all). When the time
period of recurrence was added to the model, it was not found to be significantly associated with survival for the general population with
disease recurrence. Survival improved over time only in those patients with hormone receptor-negative disease with a DRFI  3 years, both
among the 5 most recent and the entire trial data sets (P ¼ .01 and P ¼ .05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to reports from population-based studies, no general improvement in survival was observed over the last 30 years for patients who developed distant disease recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy after adjusting for DRFI.

INTRODUCTION
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains the second leading cause of cancer death in women, with > 40,000 dying each
year in the United States and > 400,000 dying globally each year.1 Although breast cancer mortality rates have declined in
the United States because of screening and improved systemic adjuvant therapy,2 the disease remains incurable for those
patients with distant metastases.3 Evidence suggests that survival has modestly improved in the era of modern systemic
therapy,4-6 indicating that further improvement may be possible with new therapeutic approaches. A potential secondary
benefit is that the identification of effective new agents for the treatment of MBC may produce survival gains when used as
adjuvant therapy for patients with localized disease: notable examples include anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab.7-9
To determine whether survival has improved for patients who developed distant disease recurrence after receiving
adjuvant therapy, we undertook a review of adjuvant phase 3 trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) over a period of approximately 30 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Population

Eleven phase 3 adjuvant breast cancer trials conducted by ECOG that treated patients using adjuvant chemotherapy and
had at least 5 years of follow-up were identified and included in the current analysis (Table 1).10-21 Participants who did
not receive adjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from this analysis.

Statistical Analysis

The primary study endpoint was survival after distant disease recurrence, defined as the time from the date of distant disease recurrence to the date of death (or date
patient was last known alive). Survival after distant disease
recurrence was determined with adjustment for baseline
covariates in a Cox proportional hazards model. The
models included calendar year of (distant) recurrence, age
at diagnosis of recurrence, estrogen receptor (ER) and
progesterone receptor (PgR) status, number of positive axillary lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis, size of the primary tumor at diagnosis, race, and distant recurrence-free
interval (DRFI). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was not available for inclusion in the model.
DRFI was defined as the time from study entry to the date
of distant disease recurrence. Because DRFI is strongly
associated with survival after recurrence and the potential
for ‘‘gap time’’ bias,22 log-rank tests for other covariates
were computed stratified on DRFI (0-3 years, > 3 to 6
years, and > 6 years). Estimates of survival after distant
disease recurrence were weighted averages of the KaplanMeier estimates computed within DRFI groups. TheraCancer

peutic intervals of interest were identified between the first
on-study date (1978) and the last point at which data
were censored (2010). Recurrences were assigned to 1 of 6
time periods: 1978 to 1983, 1984 to 1988, 1989 to 1993,
1994 to 1998, 1999 to 2003, and 2004 to 2010. The
most recent time period (2004-2010) was used as the
comparator. Analyses were based on all 3447 patients
with distant disease recurrence. In addition, we examined
the outcomes for 2237 patients who received ‘‘recent’’
chemotherapy regimens (E3189, E5188, E2190, E2197,
and E1199) between 1989 and 2002, given that the type
of adjuvant chemotherapy used might influence resistance
in the metastatic setting.

RESULTS
Characteristics of Included Trials

The study population included 13,785 patients enrolled
on 11 adjuvant ECOG trials between 1978 and 2002 (Table 1). Among the 13,785 patients enrolled, 3447 (25%)
had distant recurrences, 814 (5.9%) had local recurrences
only, and 20 (0.1%) had unknown sites of disease

Information was missing for certain variables in some patients within the entire cohort and within the cohort with recurrent disease, including age at the time
of the initial diagnosis (33 from the entire adjuvant cohort, 4 in the cohort with recurrent disease, and 0 from the cohort in the recent studies with recurrent disease), age at distant recurrence (not provided, 4, and 0, respectively), ER expression (85, 22, and 21, respectively), PgR expression (932, 386, and 33, respectively), tumor size (121, 22, and 19, respectively), LN status (76, 12, and 6, respectively), and race (301, 45, and 43, respectively).

recurrence. Table 2 shows the characteristics of both all adjuvant participants and the subset of patients with distant
recurrence. The median survival after distant recurrence in
the 3447 patients was 20 months (95% confidence interval, 19 months-21 months). Estimated 5-year and 10-year
survival rates were 16.3% and 6.4%, respectively.
Analysis of Distant Recurrence

Covariates found to be significantly associated with
inferior survival after distant disease recurrence included
ER-negative and PR-negative disease (Fig. 1A). However,
DRFI was found to be the most strongly associated with
survival after disease recurrence (Figs. 1B and 1C). Black
race and increasing number of positive axillary lymph
nodes at the time of diagnosis were also found to be
significant.
Table 3 shows the estimated hazards ratio (HR)
from the Cox proportional hazards model. Patients with a
1142

shorter DRFI fared significantly worse than those with a
longer DRFI (HR of 2.44 for DRFI > 6 years vs  3 years
[P < .0001] and HR of 1.43 for DRFI > 6 years vs > 3 to
6 years [P < .0001]). Patients with ER-negative and PRnegative disease also were found to have significantly
shorter survival after recurrence (HR, 1.35 [P < .0001]
and HR, 1.33 [P < .0001], respectively), as did patients
of black race (HR, 1.34; P < .0001) and those with more
positive lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis (HR of 1.17
for 1-3 lymph nodes vs 0 lymph nodes; HR of 1.35 for
4-9 lymph nodes vs 0 lymph nodes; and HR of 1.33 for
> 9 lymph nodes vs 0 lymph nodes [P < .0001]). Age,
primary tumor size, and year of disease recurrence were
not found to be statistically significant.
If survival after distant recurrence was evaluated
without stratification for DRFI for all 11 studies, survival
was found to significantly improve over time (Fig. 2A).
However, once stratified by DRFI, there was no

significant improvement in survival over time noted (Fig.
2B). The improvement observed in the unadjusted analysis for the entire population most likely reflects patients
with more favorable characteristics who were recruited by
later adjuvant trials (recent adjuvant trials selected for
more patients with ER-positive disease). Table 4 illustrates this point. Survival after distant disease recurrence
by time period of recurrence stratified by DRFI and hormone receptor status is shown in Figures 3A to 3D. Only
among patients with hormone receptor-negative disease
who developed disease recurrence within 3 years did there
appear to be any improvement in survival over time.
Analysis of Recent Trials Only

In the 5 most recent trials studied, factors found to be
associated with survival after distant disease recurrence
included DRFI, ER/PR expression, and race (Fig. 2C)
(Table 3). However, in contrast to the entire study population, older age at the time of disease recurrence and time
period of recurrence beginning in 1999 (compared with
before 1994) were found to be significantly associated
1144

with improved survival. However, this improvement over
time was again confined to those patients with hormone
receptor-negative disease who developed disease recurrence within 3 years of diagnosis (Figs. 4A-4E).
DISCUSSION
Among the many phase 3 MBC trials performed over the
past 30 years, survival was found to significantly improve
in only a small number of cases.23-26 Despite the difficulty in demonstrating improved survival in individual
trials, population-based studies suggest that MBC patients
now survive modestly longer than in the past.4-6 This
improvement could be because of the increased availability of drugs that when used individually have minimal
effect in prolonging survival but when used sequentially
may produce modest survival gains. Other suggested
explanations include the impact of improved imaging.4
Better imaging may lead to an apparent prolongation in
the interval between the diagnosis of disease recurrence
and death by identifying MBC at earlier time points.

Better imaging also increases the percentage of women
with de novo MBC (women with recurrent breast cancer
have inferior survival compared with women with de
novo disease).3
To determine whether the perceived improvement
in survival demonstrated by population-based studies also

was evident in clinical trial populations, we evaluated survival after recurrence among participants in ECOG clinical trials who received adjuvant chemotherapy. The
results of the current analysis suggest that for women who
develop distant recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy,

not broadly translated into improved survival. The exception appears to be among patients with hormone receptor-negative disease, who develop disease recurrence
within 3 years of diagnosis, where survival improved for
the period of recurrence beginning in 1999 (compared
with prior to 1994). Therefore, we hypothesize that this
may reflect an effect of trastuzumab rather than improved
cytotoxic therapy: trastuzumab became commercially
available in 1998, and HER2-positive disease is associated
with early recurrence.
Table 5 summarizes the characteristics of this and
other reports evaluating trends in metastatic survival.
There are several key differences between the current analysis and the other reports studied.4-6,27-29 First, we
included only patients whose disease recurred after they
received adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer and thus were more likely to have drug-resistant disease (de novo disease was included in other analyses.)
Second, we adjusted for multiple prognostic covariates in
multivariate models, including DRFI. Giordano et al4
noted large differences in outcome by the year of recurrence, which was not evident when the analysis was
adjusted for DRFI. However, not all of the prior analyses
shown in Table 5 were adjusted for DRFI and other covariates. This may have contributed to the improved survival
over time observed by others. Indeed, survival was found
to improve over time in our data set if the survival analysis
was not stratified by DRFI, thereby highlighting the importance of controlling for this variable when evaluating
survival over time.
The current study has several strengths and limitations. Strengths include the large sample size, long followup, the fact that it was conducted by the same group of

investigators, and its use of standardized treatment regimens and prospective data collection. The heterogeneity
of the population over time is a limitation imposed by
evolving eligibility criteria for the 11 adjuvant trials. To
account for this, the analysis was not based on the time period of enrollment but rather on the time period of recurrence while controlling for factors such as age, ER/PR
expression, and race. Other limitations include a lack of
information regarding sites of disease recurrence, treatments used after recurrence, and the potential for leadtime bias because of improved imaging. In addition, information regarding HER2 status and anti-HER2 therapy
was absent. Although we hypothesized that the survival
benefit for those patients diagnosed with an early recurrence after 1999 was because of the availability of trastuzumab, it is not possible for us to determine with certainty
that this finding reflects the improved survival for patients
with HER2-positive disease demonstrated in prospective
clinical trials.23,30,31
The results of the current study provided evidence
over a 30-year time period of an improvement in survival
among patients with hormone receptor-negative disease
who developed disease recurrence within 3 years after adjuvant chemotherapy for localized disease, but not for the
population as a whole. Survival appeared to improve over
the past 30 years for the entire population, but this effect
was not found to be persistent when the survival analysis
was adjusted for DRFI and other covariates. This suggests
that the survival improvements observed among population-based studies may not reflect outcomes for all subsets
of women whose disease recurs after adjuvant chemotherapy. There remains a critical need for the development of
more effective therapies for patients with MBC, especially
