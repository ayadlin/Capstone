ABSTRACT
A pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), obtained from a patient, was grown
orthotopically in the pancreatic tail of nude mice to establish a patient-derived orthotopic
(PDOX) model. Seven weeks after implantation, PDOX nude mice were divided into the
following groups: untreated control (n = 7); gemcitabine (100 mg/kg, i.p., once a week
for 2 weeks, n = 7); cobimetinib (5 mg/kg, p.o., 14 consecutive days, n = 7); trametinib
(0.3 mg/kg, p.o., 14 consecutive days, n = 7); trabectedin (0.15 mg/kg, i.v., once a
week for 2 weeks, n = 7); temozolomide (25 mg/kg, p.o., 14 consecutive days, n = 7);
carfilzomib (2 mg/kg, i.v., twice a week for 2 weeks, n = 7); bortezomib (1 mg/kg,
i.v., twice a week for 2 weeks, n = 7); MK-1775 (20 mg/kg, p.o., 14 consecutive days,
n = 7); BEZ-235 (45 mg/kg, p.o., 14 consecutive days, n = 7); vorinostat (50 mg/kg,
i.p., 14 consecutive days, n = 7). Only the MEK inhibitors, cobimetinib and trametinib,
regressed tumor growth, and they were more significantly effective than other therapies
(p < 0.0001, respectively), thereby demonstrating the precision of the PDOX models of
PDAC and its potential for individualizing pancreatic-cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Clinically-relevant mouse models of pancreatic
cancer could enable precision therapy based on the
individual patient tumor. For this purpose, our laboratory
pioneered the patient-derived orthotopic xenograft
(PDOX) nude-mouse model with the technique of surgical
orthotopic implantation (SOI), including breast cancer
[19], ovarian cancer [20], lung cancer [21], cervical
cancer [22], colon cancer [23–25], stomach cancer [26],
melanoma [18, 27–29], sarcoma [30–34], as well as
pancreatic cancer [35–38]. The PDOX model, developed
by our laboratory over the past 28 years, has many
advantages, including a patient-like metastatic pattern,
over subcutaneous-transplant models which are growing
ectopically under the skin and very rarely metastasize [39].

Gemcitabine (GEM) is first-line therapy for pancreatic
cancer [1, 2] with a poor response rate of approximately
10% [3]. Novel drugs tested on pancreatic cancer include
MEK inhibitors (cobimetinib [COB], trametinib [TRA])
[5–8], an PI3K/mTOR inhibitor (BEZ-235) [4–9], an
HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) [10], proteasome inhibitors
(bortezomib, carfilzomib) [11, 12], a Wee-1 inhibitor
(MK-1775) [13], temozolomide (TEM) [14] and trabectedin
(TRAB) [15–17]. Whether a patient’s tumor is sensitive
to any of these drugs is not knowable a priory. Genetic
profiling can provide important information, but does not
necessarily match drug sensitivity [18].

In a previous PDOX study of a BRAF-V600Emutant melanoma, TRA, an MEK inhibitor, was the only
agent of the 4 tested that caused tumor regression. Another
MEK inhibitor, COB, could slow but not arrest growth
or cause regression of the melanoma. The patient in this
study had a BRAF-V600E-mutant melanoma and would
be considered to be a strong candidate for vemurafenib
(VEM) as first-line therapy, since VEM targets this
mutation. However, VEM was not effectivein the PDOX
model. The PDOX model thus helped identify the veryhigh efficacy of TRA against the melanoma PDOX
and is a promising drug for this patient. These results
demonstrated the powerful precision of the PDOX model
for cancer therapy, not achievable by genomic analysis
alone [18].
Therefore, in the present study, in a PDOX nudemouse model with pancreatic cancer from a patient we
evaluated TRA and COB and 8 other drugs to find the
best treatment strategy for this patient and demonstrate the
precision of the pancreatic-cancer PDOX model. As with
the melanoma PDOX, TRA and COB were most effective
in the pancreatic cancer PDOX.

precise, individualized therapy, especially for recalcitrant
disease such as pancreatic cancer [18].
Previously-developed concepts and strategies of
highly-selective tumor targeting can take advantage of
molecular targeting of tumors, including tissue-selective
therapy which focuses on unique differences between
normal and tumor tissues [40–45].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Athymic nu/nu nude mice (AntiCancer Inc., San
Diego, CA), 4–6 weeks old, were used in this study.
Animals were housed in a barrier facility on a high efficacy
particulate arrestance (HEPA)-filtered rack under standard
conditions of 12-hour light/dark cycles. The animals were
fed an autoclaved laboratory rodent diet. All mouse surgical
procedures and imaging were performed with the animals
anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of a ketamine
mixture (0.02 ml solution of 20 mg/kg ketamine, 15.2 mg/
kg xylazine, and 0.48 mg/kg acepromazine maleate). The
response of animals during surgery was monitored to ensure
adequate depth of anesthesia. The animals were observed
on a daily basis and humanely sacrificed by CO2 inhalation
if they met the following humane endpoint criteria: severe
tumor burden (more than 20 mm in diameter), prostration,
significant body weight loss, difficulty breathing, rotational
motion, and body temperature drop. All animal studies were
conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures
outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Animals under Assurance Number A3873-1
[18, 27–29].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
All tested drugs, including GEM, COB, TRA, TRAB,
TEM, carfilzomib, bortezomib, BEZ-235, vorinostat,
inhibited tumor growth in the pancreatic cancer PDOX
compared to untreated control (p < 0.0001, respectively)
on day 14 after treatment initiation. However, only the
MEK inhibitors, COB and TRA, regressed tumor growth
and they were significantly more effective than other drugs
(p < 0.0001, respectively) including GEM that is widely
used as first line standard therapy for pancreatic cancer
(p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between
COB and TRA (p = 0.0988) (Figures 1, 2).
The relative body weight on day 14 compared with
day 0 did not significantly differ between any treatment
group or untreated control (Figure 3). There were no
animal deaths in any groups.
Histologically, the untreated control tumor was
mainly comprised of viable cells, in contrast, necrosis was
observed in the tumor treated with COB (Figure 4).
GEM is first-line therapy for pancreatic cancer, but
the response rate is only approximately 10% [3]. In the
present study, GEM could not arrest or regress the tumor
growth but showed inhibition compared to the untreated
control. In contrast, COB and TRA regressed the tumor
and were significantly more effective than GEM. These
results suggest that MEK inhibitors might be used as first
line therapy for this patient.
Although, the present patient’s tumor was sensitive
to MEK inhibitors in the PDOX models. Other patients’
tumors may be sensitive for other drugs such as TRAB,
TEM, carfilzomib, bortezomib, MK-1775, BEZ-235,
or vorinostat, as well as GEM. A PDOX model enables

Patient-derived tumor
The pancreatic cancer was resected in the
Department of Surgery, University of California, San
Diego (UCSD). Written informed consent was provided
by the patient, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)
of UCSD approved this experiment.

Establishment of PDOX models of pancreatic
cancer by surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI)
A fresh sample of pancreatic cancer of the patient
was obtained and transported immediately to the
laboratory at AntiCancer, Inc., on wet ice. The sample was
cut into 5-mm fragments and implanted subcutaneously in
nude mice. After five weeks, the subcutaneously-implanted
tumors grew to more than 10 mm in diameter. The
subcutaneously-grown tumors were then harvested and
cut into small fragments (3 mm3). After nude mice were
anesthetized with the ketamine solution described above,
a 1–2 cm skin incision was made on the left side abdomen
through the skin, fascia and peritoneum and pancreas was

Histological examination

(50 mg/kg, i.p., 14 consecutive days, n = 7). Tumor length
and width were measured both pre- and post-treatment.
Tumor volume was calculated with the following formula:
Tumor volume (mm3) = length (mm) × width (mm) × width
(mm) × 1/2. Data are presented as mean ± SD. The tumor
volume ratio is defined at the tumor volume at a posttreatment point relative to pre-treatment tumor volume.

Fresh tumor samples were fixed in 10% formalin
and embedded in paraffin before sectioning and staining.
Tissue sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized in xylene and
rehydrated in an ethanol series. Hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining was performed according to standard
protocols. Histological examination was performed
with a BHS System Microscope (Olympus Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan). Images were acquired with INFINITY
ANALYZE software (Lumenera Corporation, Ottawa,
Canada) [18, 29].

Imaging of the pancreatic cancer PDOX model
Imaging of the macroscopic tumor was performed with the
OV100 Small Animal Imaging System (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, the PDOX model identified the
ability of MEK inhibitors to regress a pancreatic cancer
PDOX. That COB and TRA caused tumor regression
indicated their potential efficacy for the patient donor of
the PDOX in the present study. These results demonstrate
the powerful precision of the PDOX model to distinguish
the most effective of the 10 drugs tested.
Future experiments will test the present and other
pancreatic cancer PDOX models with various therapies
and compare the results with clinical outcome.
