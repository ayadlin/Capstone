Abstract

Author Manuscript

Translational control at the initiation step has been recognized as a major and important regulatory
mechanism of gene expression. eIF3a, a putative subunit of eIF3 complex, has recently been
shown to play an important role in regulating translation of a subset of mRNAs and found to
correlate with prognosis of cancers. In this study, using nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells as
a model system we tested the hypothesis that eIF3a negatively regulates synthesis of nucleotide
excision repair (NER) proteins and, thus, NER activities and cellular response to treatments with
DNA damaging agents such as cisplatin. We found that a cisplatin-sensitive subclone S16 isolated
from a NPC cell line CNE2 via limited dilution has increased eIF3a expression. Knocking down
its expression in S16 cells increased cellular resistance to cisplatin, NER activity, and synthesis of
NER proteins XPA, XPC, RAD23B, and RPA32. Altering eIF3a expression also changed cellular
response to cisplatin and UV treatment in other NPC cell lines. Taken together, we conclude that
eIF3a plays an important role in cisplatin response and NER activity of nasopharyngeal
carcinomas by suppressing synthesis of NER proteins.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Translational control plays a major role in regulating gene expression and occurs primarily
at the initiation step involving multiple eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) (Dong
and Zhang, 2006; Mathews et al., 2000). eIF3a, the largest subunit of eIF3 complex, has
been suggested to play roles in regulating translation of a subset of mRNAs and in
regulating cell cycle progression and cell proliferation (Dong et al., 2009a; Dong and Zhang,
2006). Suppressing endogenous eIF3a expression has been shown to reverse malignant
phenotype of human cancer cells (Dong et al., 2004) while over-expression of ectopic eIF3a
has been shown to promote malignant transformation of mammalian cells (Zhang et al.,
2007). eIF3a expression has also been correlated with better prognosis of human cancer
patients and eIF3a up-regulation in lung cancer patients correlates with their response to
platinum-based chemotherapy and contributes to increased cisplatin sensitivity (Yin et al.,
2010). These observations suggest that eIF3a plays an important role in tumorigenesis and in
cancer cell response to chemotherapeutics, possibly by regulating gene expression.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a high incidence in South China although it is a rare
disease in other parts of the world. The first treatment choice for NPC is radiation therapy,
which has given satisfactory outcomes in early stage of NPC (Xiao et al., 2009). However,
approximately 70% of patients with newly diagnosed NPC present locally advanced, nonmetastatic stage III or IV diseases (Agulnik and Siu, 2005) and experience poor prognosis
from radiation therapy with a 5-year overall survival rate varying from 37%–61% (Afqir et
al., 2009; Agulnik and Siu, 2005). Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is now considered as a
standard treatment approach for locally advanced NPC and cisplatin-based regimen has been
identified as the best protocol by meta-analysis (Baujat et al., 2006; Thephamongkhol et al.,
2004). Compared with radiotherapy alone, combination of cisplatin-based chemotherapy
with radiation improved 5-year overall survival by 6% (from 56% to 62%) and 5-year
disease-free survival by 10% (from 42% to 52%) for locally advanced NPC (Baujat et al.,
2006). Unfortunately, many NPC patients do not benefit much from the concurrent chemoradiotherapy, possibly due to variation in treatment responses and cisplatin resistance.
Clearly, finding the underlying mechanisms of chemosensitivity/resistance in NPC will
likely help predict potential responses of NPC patients for better clinical outcome with less
toxicity to the patients.
Toward this goal, we have selected a cisplatin sensitive S16 clone from an NPC cell line via
limited dilution and demonstrated that eIF3a expression is increased and contributes to
cisplatin sensitivity in S16 clone. Knocking down eIF3a expression in S16 cells up-regulates
cellular nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity via increasing the synthesis rate of NER
proteins such as XPA, XPC, RAD23B, and RPA. These observations suggest that eIF3a may
be a major candidate contributing to cisplatin sensitivity of NPC and implicates that eIF3a

may be used as a biomarker predicting treatment outcome of cisplatin-based chemotherapy
for locally advanced NPC.

Results
Selection and characterization of a cisplatin-sensitive clone S16 from NPC CNE-2 cells

Author Manuscript

Previously, stepwise selections with anticancer drugs have been used as a standard method
to create model cell lines for laboratory studies of acquired drug resistance. However, tumor
heterogeneity could be a natural intrinsic cause of resistance (or sensitivity) in response to
drug treatment. To investigate the mechanism of cisplatin sensitivity/resistance of NPC
cells, we performed a study using an approach, different from the standard stepwise drug
selection, by clonal selection using limited dilution. With this approach, a cisplatin-sensitive
clone, S16, was selected from the parental CNE-2 cell line. S16 is about 3-fold more
sensitive to cisplatin than the parental CNE-2 cells with IC50 2.5±0.31 μM for S16 vs
8.7±0.75 μM for CNE-2 (Fig. 1A).
To verify that the S16 clone is authentically originated from CNE-2, we examined their p53
mutation and short tandem repeat (STR) profiles. Both S16 and CNE-2 harbor an identical
point mutation at codon 280 (exon 8) of p53 with a change of AGA (arginine) to ACA
(threonine). The short tandem repeat (STR) profiles of CNE-2 and S16 cells are also the
same, except lost allele 216 at D21S11 locus for S16 cells (supplemental Table S1), showing
a spontaneous genetic alteration which can be common in cancer cell lines. These findings
suggest that S16 is likely derived from CNE2 but with an increased sensitivity to cisplatin.

Author Manuscript

To determine if the increased cisplatin sensitivity of S16 cells is due to increases in
cisplatin-induced apoptosis, S16 and its parental cell line CNE-2 were treated with cisplatin
at 8.7 μM for 24 and 48 hrs followed by DAPI staining analysis of disintegrated nuclei, an
indicator of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1B and 1C, S16 cells have significantly more cells
with disintegrated nuclei compared with CNE-2 cells at both 24 and 48 hrs of cisplatin
treatment. The cisplatin-induced apoptosis can be reversed by pretreatment with z-VADfmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor. These observations suggest that S16 cells are more
sensitive to cisplatin-induced apoptosis than its parental CNE-2 cells.
Contribution of eIF3a over-expression to cisplatin sensitivity of S16 cells

Author Manuscript

Previously, it has been shown that cervical and esophageal cancer patients with high eIF3a
level have better relapse-free and overall survival than those with low eIF3a expression
(Chen and Burger, 1999; Dellas et al., 1998). Since cisplatin is a primary anti-cancer drug
for treating these cancers, it is conceivable that eIF3a may contribute to cisplatin response of
these cancers. Indeed, it was recently found that eIF3a up-regulation in lung cancer patients
correlated with their response to platinum-based chemotherapy and contributed to increased
cisplatin sensitivity (Yin et al., 2010). Based on these previous observations, we propose
that eIF3a expression may be up-regulated in S16 cells compared with CNE-2 and
contributes to the increased cisplatin sensitivity of S16 cells.
To test this hypothesis, we first examined eIF3a expression level in S16 and CNE-2 cells
using Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2A, S16 cells clearly have more eIF3a than CNE-2

cells. We next examined if the up-regulated eIF3a expression possibly contributes to the
increased cisplatin sensitivity of S16 cells by knocking down eIF3a expression in S16 cells
followed by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, eIF3a is successfully knocked down as
determined using Western blot. S16 cells with reduced eIF3a expression are also more
resistant to cisplatin than the control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 2B) with
~3.5-fold increase in relative resistance factor as determined using MTT assay (Fig. 2D).
Similar results were also observed using colony formation assay (data not shown),
eliminating the possible contribution of cell proliferation on drug sensitivity. Thus, the upregulated eIF3a level likely contributes to the increased cisplatin sensitivity of S16 cells
compared to its parental CNE-2 cells.

Author Manuscript

To confirm the above conclusion, we next performed a reverse experiment by increasing
eIF3a expression in the parental CNE-2 cells and determined if the increased eIF3a level
would cause increased cisplatin sensitivity in CNE-2 cells. For this purpose, a pool of stable
CNE-2 cells transfected with eIF3a cDNA for ectopic eIF3a over-expression was selected
and subjected to MTT assay (Fig. 2C). It was found that the CNE-2 cells with stable eIF3a
over-expression were more sensitive to cisplatin with a 2-fold decrease in relative resistance
factor (RRF) compared to the control cells transfected with vector (Fig. 2D). Taken together,
we conclude that eIF3a over-expression contributes to the increased cisplatin sensitivity of
S16 cells.
The contribution of eIF3a to cisplatin sensitivity is not cell line specific

Author Manuscript

To rule out the possibility that the contribution of eIF3a to cisplatin sensitivity is specific to
CNE-2 and its derivative cell lines, we next tested another NPC cell line, SUNE-1, by
knocking down eIF3a expression followed by MTT assay. For this experiment we also
included the parental CNE-2 cell line to determine if knocking down eIF3a expression
would further increase its cisplatin resistance. As shown in Fig. 3A, eIF3a expression is
successfully knocked down by siRNA in both cell lines as determined using Western blot.
Both cell lines with reduced eIF3a level are also more resistant to cisplatin (Fig. 3B) with
~2-fold increase in RRF compared to their respective control cells transfected with
scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3C). Thus, the role of eIF3a in cisplatin sensitivity is likely not cell
line specific and decreasing its level in the parental resistant CNE-2 cells could further
increase its cisplatin resistance.
The up-regulated eIF3a level contributes to the increase in cisplatin-induced apoptosis of
S16 cells

Author Manuscript

As discussed above, S16 cells have an increased sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis
compared to its parental CNE-2 cells (Fig. 1). To determine if eIF3a up-regulation mediates
this process, we first examined if knocking down eIF3a level in S16 cells would reduce
cisplatin-induced apoptosis by analysis of disintegrated nuclei as described above. As shown
in Fig. 4A, S16 cells transfected with eIF3a siRNA clearly have significantly less apoptosis
following cisplatin treatment than the control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. We
next examined cleavage of PARP, a 115-kDa protein substrate of caspases during execution
of apoptosis. Cleavage of PARP by caspases yields an 85-kDa fragment. As shown in Fig.
4B, S16 cells transfected with eIF3a siRNA generate much less cleaved 85-kDa PARP

product than the control cells following cisplatin treatment. Thus, the up-regulated eIF3a
level in S16 cells likely mediates the increase in cisplatin-induced apoptosis of S16 cells
compared to its parental CNE2 cells.
eIF3a down-regulates NER activity and expression of NER proteins

Author Manuscript

Cisplatin causes cytotoxicity by causing DNA damages with formation of cisplatin-DNA
adducts. To survive this DNA damage, cells use mainly nucleotide excision repair (NER) to
remove cisplatin-DNA adducts. Thus, we hypothesize that eIF3a expression may reduce
NER activities, which in turn increases cisplatin sensitivity and cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
To test this hypothesis, we first examined if eIF3a expression affects cellular response to UV
treatment which causes DNA damages that are also repaired by NER. For this purpose, S16
cells transfected with eIF3a or scrambled control siRNA were subjected to UV treatment
followed by analysis of apoptosis using ELISA. As shown in Fig. 4C, S16 cells transfected
with eIF3a siRNA are significantly more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis than the control
cells at both 30 and 60 J/cm2.

Author Manuscript

Next, the effect of knocking down eIF3a expression in S16 cells on NER activity was
determined using host cell reactivation (HCR) assay (Qiao et al., 2002). For this purpose, a
plasmid containing luciferase reporter was first UV-irradiated to generate DNA adducts. The
damaged reporter plasmids were then transfected into S16 cells with reduced eIF3a
expression followed by analysis of luciferase activity with the assumption that the damaged
reporter plasmid will give the expression of luciferase only after its UV-induced damages
are repaired by the cellular NER mechanism (Qiao et al., 2002). As shown in Fig. 5A,
knocking down eIF3a expression significantly increases NER activities by ~1.5 fold. Thus,
the up-regulated eIF3a expression in S16 cells likely suppresses cellular NER activity,
which in turn contributes to the increased sensitivity to cisplatin or UV-induced apoptosis.

Author Manuscript

NER represents one of the known major DNA repair mechanisms and it involves several
key DNA repair proteins (Sancar et al., 2004; Zou et al., 2006). Because eIF3a has been
shown previously to play important roles in regulating gene expression by controlling
protein synthesis (Dong and Zhang, 2006; Yin et al., 2011), we hypothesize that the
increased eIF3a level in S16 cells likely down-regulates the synthesis of NER proteins
which in turn down-regulates NER activity. To test this hypothesis, we first determined the
effect of eIF3a on the expression of NER proteins following eIF3a knockdown using
Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5B, knocking down eIF3a expression clearly
increases the level of key NER proteins XPA, XPC, RPA32, and RAD23B. However, the
mRNA level of these NER proteins is not affected by knocking down eIF3a expression (Fig.
5C). Thus, the effect of eIF3a on the expression of NER proteins is likely at their protein
levels.
To further determine if eIF3a possibly regulates the synthesis but not stability of these
representative NER proteins, we performed pulse and pulse-chase labeling in combination
with immunoprecipitation and autoradiography to measure the synthesis and half life of
these NER proteins. As shown in Fig. 6, eIF3a knockdown in S16 cells has no effect on the
half-life of these NER proteins but dramatically increases their synthesis rate as determined
using pulse-chase and pulse labeling experiments, respectively. Taken together, these

findings suggest that eIF3a negatively regulates the synthesis of NER proteins by
suppressing the translation of their mRNAs without affecting their transcription to produce
mRNAs or stability (or degradation) of these proteins. It is noteworthy that the degradation
of these NER proteins may occur differently with XPA and XPC in bi-phase while RPA32
and RAD23B in mono-phase mode. Regardless, eIF3a does not appear to have any effect on
their degradation.

Discussions

Author Manuscript

In this study, we have successfully selected a cisplatin sensitive NPC cell clone, S16, from
CNE-2 cell line by limited dilution and demonstrated that eIF3a over-expression contributes
to the increased cisplatin sensitivity in S16 cells by suppressing synthesis of NER proteins
which, in turn, contributes to the increase in cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cisplatin
sensitivity. This outcome establishes eIF3a as a potential marker predicting cisplatin
responses and helping guide future treatment of NPC patients.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we have successfully generated a cisplatin sensitive clone, S16, from a NPC
cell line CNE-2 by limited dilution. S16 appears to be generated authentically from CNE-2
possibly due to spontaneous genetic changes. This argument is supported by the finding of
only a partial incompatibility at D21S11 locus between S16 and its parental CNE-2 cells.
The finding of increased eIF3a expression also supports the above argument. However, it is
currently unknown how eIF3a expression is up-regulated in S16 cells. Previously, increased
expression of eIF3a has been found in various human cancers compared to normal tissues
(Bachmann et al., 1997; Chen and Burger, 1999; Chen and Burger, 2004; Dellas et al., 1998;
Pincheira et al., 2001). It is possible that the increased eIF3a expression in these systems
uses similar mechanisms of up-regulation. Future studies investigating the mechanism of
eIF3a expression regulation will be beneficial to address this issue.

eIF3a was initially thought to be essential for global translation initiation process. However,
accumulating evidences suggest that eIF3a may play a more important regulatory role in
mRNA translation. It was first found that the eIF3 complex lacking eIF3a worked without
distinction from eIF3 complex containing eIF3a in forming pre-initiation complexes
(Chaudhuri et al., 1997). Later, it was found that knocking down eIF3a expression did not
severely suppress global mRNA translation but, in fact, it increased synthesis of proteins
such as p27 while suppressing synthesis of ribonucleotide reductase M2 (Dong et al., 2004).
The finding in this paper that knocking down eIF3a increased the synthesis of NER proteins
further enforces the possible regulatory role of eIF3a in translational control. Furthermore,
we have also observed previously that knocking down or ectopically over-expressing eIF3a
does not affect the expression of other putative eIF3 subunits, suggesting that the regulatory
role of eIF3a may not involve the change in expression of other putative eIF3 subunits
(Dong et al., 2004).
It is still not yet understood how eIF3a participates in translational control. The finding that
eIF3a possibly regulates the synthesis of a group of proteins in NER is also puzzling.
Nevertheless, it has been suggested previously that the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of mRNAs under
eIF3a regulation may mediate this regulatory process. For example, the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of

p27 and ribonucleotide reductase M2 appeared to be responsible for eIF3a regulation of the
translation of these genes (Dong et al., 2004). Recently, it was found that the synthesis of
phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 (PRL-3) was suppressed by PolyC-RNA-binding protein
1 (PCBP1) via PCBP1 binding to a triple GCCCAG motifs in the 5′-UTR of PRL-3 mRNAs
(Wang et al.). Thus, it is possible that the mRNAs under eIF3a regulation may have a
consensus sequence motif in their UTRs that can possibly bind to eIF3a. This possibility is
waiting to be tested.

Cisplatin is an anticancer drug used to treat many types of cancers including
nasopharyngeal, lung, ovarian, cervical, and esophageal cancers. Unfortunately, lack of
response to cisplatin frequently occurs, which limits successes in the treatment of these
cancers. Increase in DNA damage repair is one of the mechanisms of cisplatin resistance
(Siddik, 2003). NER is the main pathway for the repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage
(Neher et al., 2010a; Neher et al., 2010b; Nouspikel, 2009), which functions by recognizing
DNA adducts via XPC-RAD23B subcomplex and forming NER complex through the
binding of XPA, RPA, and other proteins (Friedberg, 2001). NER pathway defect results in
cellular hypersensitivity to cisplatin, and restoring NER activity will increase cellular
resistance (Furuta et al., 2002; Siddik, 2003). The current finding that eIF3a expression
negatively regulates the expression of NER-related proteins (XPA, XPC, RAD23B and
RPA) and contributes to cisplatin sensitivity suggests that assessing eIF3a level may help
predict cisplatin responses and design individualized treatment strategies for patients with
these cancers. Previously, it has been observed that cervical and esophageal cancer patients
with high eIF3a level had better relapse-free and overall survival than that with low eIF3a
expression (Chen and Burger, 1999; Dellas et al., 1998). Since cisplatin is a primary anticancer drug for treating these cancers, it is conceivable that eIF3a may contribute to cisplatin
response in these cancer patients. It is also tempting to speculate that eIF3a expression may
contribute to cellular response to cisplatin in any cancers that are treated with this drug and
that assessing eIF3a level may help predict response and design treatment strategies for
these cancers.

Cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays

Author Manuscript

Cytotoxicity of cisplatin was determined using MTT and colony formation assays as
previously described (Li et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2007; Yang
et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2010). Briefly, stable cell lines or cells harvested
from transient transfection were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 2000 cells/well for
24 hours and then treated with cisplatin at various concentrations for three days (MTT) or 8–
11 days (colony formation). Viable cells were stained with MTT followed by determination
of OD570 nm with a reference wavelength at 630 nm or stained with crystal violet for colony
counting. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism4 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA) to obtain an IC50. The relative resistance factor was calculated by dividing the IC50 of
cells with altered eIF3a expression by the IC50 of control cells.
Apoptosis analysis by DAPI or Hoechst 33342 staining of disintegrated nuclei was
performed as previously described (Koo et al., 1999). Briefly, both floating and adherent
cells following cisplatin treatment were harvested and stained with DAPI or Hoechst dye.
The stained cells were mounted onto a polylysine-coated slide by centrifugation and
examined under a fluorescent microscope. A total of 300~400 nuclei from five randomly
chosen fields were examined and the nuclei displaying distinctive apoptosis-associated
morphologic changes were scored. Apoptosis was expressed as a percentage of the total

Apoptosis analysis using Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) was
performed as instructed by manufacturer. Briefly, S16 cells were plated in six-well plate at
2.5×105 cell per well and cultured for 24 hours before being transfected with eIF3a or
scrambled control siRNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, media were replaced with
fresh complete media and the cells were irradiated with various doses of UV light followed
by continuous culture for 24 hours. Cells were then harvested and about 1×104 cells were
lysed and analyzed for apoptosis. PARP cleavage, indicator of apoptosis, was analyzed
using Western blot probed with an antibody that detects mainly the large fragment of
cleaved PARP to avoid potential confusion from detection of uncleaved PARP.

Host-cell reactivation assay (HCR)

Author Manuscript

The firefly luciferase assay-based HCR was performed as previously described (Qiao et al.,
2002). Briefly, the pCMVluc plasmid (50 μg/ml) in a 48-well plate was UV irradiated on ice
using a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). UV-induced damages
were verified using PCR as previously described (Yin et al., 2010). The UV-damaged or unirradiated control plasmids (0.2 μg) were used to transfect 4×104 cells in a 24-well plate
using Lipofectamine. A pCMV-SPORT-βgal (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) plasmid
encoding β galactosidase was used as a control for transfection efficiency. Forty hours after
transfection, cells were harvested for analysis of firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase
activities as previously described (Dong et al., 2004).
Pulse and pulse-chase labeling of cells

Author Manuscript

Pulse and pulse-chase labeling of cells were performed as previously described (Dong et al.,
2004; Dong and Zhang, 2003). Briefly, the transiently transfected cells were cultured for
additional 48 hrs and washed twice with PBS, once with DMEM medium lacking
methionine, followed by incubation for 2 hrs in the same medium supplemented with 7.5
μCi/ml [35S]methionine. The pulse-labeled cells were then washed three times with PBS and
harvested for cell lysate preparation and immunoprecipitation. To chase the labeling, cells
were washed twice with PBS and once with DMEM medium following the 2 hr pulselabeling. The cells were then cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml cold
methionine up to 8 hours. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were harvested for
cell lysate preparation and immunoprecipitation.
Immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

Following pulse or pulse-chase labeling, cells were harvested and lysed in TNN-SDS buffer
without DTT as described above. The lysates were then incubated with 1 μg of normal
mouse IgG at 4° C for 2 hrs followed by incubation with 50 μl of 50% protein G-agarose
slurry at 4° C for addition 3 hrs and centrifugation at 500×g for 5 min to remove nonspecific bound proteins. The supernatants were then incubated with 5 μg of primary
antibodies against XPA, XPC, RAD23B, and RPA32 at 4° C for 2 hrs before mixing with 50
μl of protein G-agarose beads. The mixtures were incubated at 4° C overnight followed by
washing for five times with lysis buffer. The final precipitates were separated by SDSPAGE and signals were detected by ECL system.
