Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The cancer genome is moulded by the dual processes of somatic mutation and selection.
Homozygous deletions in cancer genomes occur over recessive cancer genes, where they can
confer selective growth advantage, and over fragile sites, where they are thought to reflect an
increased local rate of DNA breakage. However, most homozygous deletions in cancer genomes
are unexplained. Here we identified 2,428 somatic homozygous deletions in 746 cancer cell lines.
These overlie 11% of protein-coding genes that, therefore, are not mandatory for survival of
human cells. We derived structural signatures that distinguish between homozygous deletions over
recessive cancer genes and fragile sites. Application to clusters of unexplained homozygous
deletions suggests that many are in regions of inherent fragility, whereas a small subset overlies
recessive cancer genes. The results illustrate how structural signatures can be used to distinguish
between the influences of mutation and selection in cancer genomes. The extensive copy number,
genotyping, sequence and expression data available for this large series of publicly available
cancer cell lines renders them informative reagents for future studies of cancer biology and drug
discovery.
The genome of a cancer cell usually carries several somatic changes1. A subset, termed
‘driver’ mutations, confer clonal growth advantage, are positively selected and are causally
implicated in cancer development. The remainder are ‘passengers’.
A central challenge presented by catalogues of structural abnormalities from cancer
genomes is distinguishing drivers from passengers. One approach is to assume that
passenger mutations are randomly distributed, while drivers are restricted to a subset of
genes. Thus mutational catalogues from several cancer samples will show non-random

accumulation of drivers in certain genes. However, the underlying assumption that
passengers are randomly distributed need not always be correct. A cluster of somatic
mutations may also be attributable to an increased local mutation rate. Passenger mutations
arising in these circumstances may be confused with drivers.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

This problem may apply to any type of structural alteration. For example, clusters of base
substitution somatic mutations occur in some lymphoid neoplasms owing to a hypermutation
phenotype involved in the generation of immune diversity2,3. Similarly, small insertions and
deletions occur at polynucleotide tracts in cancers with defective DNA mismatch repair.
Some, within the coding exons of genes, have been proposed as drivers4-6. However, the
presence of probable passenger insertions and deletions at similar frequencies in intronic and
intergenic polynucleotide tracts renders this interpretation uncertain.
Distinguishing driver from passenger mutations has particularly compromised the search for
somatically mutated recessive cancer genes (tumour suppressor genes). Large homozygous
deletions (HDs) of recessive cancer genes result in their inactivation and are driver
mutations. The identification of several recessive cancer genes including CDKN2A7, RB1
(ref. 8), SMAD4 (ref. 9), SMARCB1 (ref. 10), MAP2K4 (ref. 11) and PTEN12 has primarily
depended on detection of HDs in cancer genomes. However, similar HDs in cancer genomes
occur over common fragile sites—regions that show increased rates of chromosome
breakage in normal cells in response to agents causing replicative stress13.
One approach to distinguish between HD clusters due to recessive cancer genes and fragile
sites is to investigate the presence of alternative inactivating changes such as proteintruncating point mutations. These are expected in recessive cancer genes but not in fragile
sites. However, the prevalence of truncating point mutations in recessive cancer genes is
variable, limiting the utility of this approach. Here we have characterized copy number
changes at high resolution in a large series of cancer cell lines and extracted structural
features that facilitate discrimination between HDs over recessive cancer genes and fragile
sites.

Genomic features of cancer cell lines
We analysed 746 publicly available cancer cell lines derived from many different cancer
classes (Supplementary Table 1). The series includes most lines used in studies of cancer
biology or cancer drug sensitivity, notably the NCI-60 set that has been exposed to tens of
thousands of potential anti-cancer compounds.
DNA was hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0 arrays to extract information on genotype status
and copy number changes. A total of 121,340 breakpoints were detected, each mapped to an
average resolution of <5 kilobases (kb). These breakpoints mark the boundaries of segments
of copy number increase (including amplifications), reduction (including hemizygous and
homozygous deletions) and losses of heterozygosity (LOH) (Supplementary Figs 1–3 and
Supplementary Table 2). We observed 1,198 individual regions of >10-fold amplification
(Supplementary Table 3). Of these, 138 were over MYC, MYCN, ERBB2, MYCL1, EGFR,
MDM2, AKT2, ALK, MITF and REL, cancer genes that are known to contribute to
oncogenesis through amplification (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/). The
746 cancer cell lines have also been sequenced for mutations in the coding exons of 46
known cancer genes and analysed for gene expression. In total, 1,753 putative oncogenic
mutations were identified including 1,302 point mutations and 378 HDs in addition to the
amplifications described earlier (Supplementary Tables 3–5; http://www.sanger.ac.uk/
genetics/CGP/CellLines/, http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/genetics/CGP/cghviewer/

The landscape of HDs in cancer genomes
The detection of HDs in primary cancers is compromised by the presence of non-neoplastic
tissue. Cancer cell lines are free of this confounder, providing advantageous reagents with
which to study the origins of HDs, even though further genomic alterations may have
occurred during culture14.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

A total of 6,058 HDs were observed. DNA from normal tissue from the same individual is
not available for most lines, therefore it is not possible to evaluate directly whether either or
both of the deletion events constituting a HD were somatically acquired or were present in
the germ line. To address this, we analysed 466 DNAs from normal tissues (Supplementary
Table 6) and derived filters discriminating between germline and somatic deletions.
We classified 3,630 HDs as germ line. These formed 205 clusters of two or more HDs and
109 singletons. In total, 23 megabases (Mb) of the reference human genome fell within HDs
of germline origin, containing part or all of 246 (1%) protein-coding genes.
In total, 2,428 HDs were classified as somatic (Supplementary Table 7). In aggregate, these
delete 519 Mb (17.3%) of the reference genome and contain part or all of the coding
sequences of 2,369 (11%) protein-coding genes that are presumably not mandatory for the
survival of human cells in tissue culture. Somatic HDs were ~10-fold larger than those of
germline origin (average size 510 kb compared to 49 kb).
The distribution of somatic HDs across the genome is illustrated in Fig. 1. On the basis of
overlapping genomic footprints, 1,689 out of 2,428 (70%) fell into 206 clusters, and 739
(30%) were singletons overlapping no other deletion (Supplementary Fig. 4). We were able
to attribute the likely underlying cause to 38 of the 206 (18%) clusters.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Fourteen (including 389 HDs) were located over the known recessive cancer genes
CDKN2A, PTEN, RB, SMAD4, NF1, MAP2K4, MSH2, TP53, NF2, MLH1, SMARCB1,
PIK3R1, BMPR1A and CDH1 (Supplementary Tables 2, 4 and 7). CDKN2A (p16) exhibits
more HDs than other recessive cancer genes (Fig. 1). This may be because it is adjacent to a
large gene desert and therefore HDs are associated with less negative selection. However, it
is also possible that inactivation of CDKN2B (which is adjacent to CDKN2A) and p14ARF
(which shares an overlapping coding sequence) confers further selective advantage15. This
combination of inactivated genes is more likely to occur through large deletions overlying
CDKN2A than by point mutations in its coding sequence.
Nineteen of the 38 HD clusters (including 419 HDs) were over the 39 fragile sites whose
genomic location has been fine-mapped (Supplementary Table 7). There was considerable
variation in the activity of fragile sites in cancer genomes. For example, many HDs were
observed over FRA2F, FRA3B, FRA4F, FRA5H and FRA16D, but few over FRA2B,
FRA4B and FRA16C (Fig. 1).
Five of the 38 HD clusters (38 HDs) mapped over regions known to be somatically
rearranged in lymphoid cells to generate immunological diversity. The deepest of these is
over the T-cell-receptor-α gene on chromosome 14. Most HDs in these clusters (33 out of
38) are in cancers of haematological or lymphoid system origins.
There were 168 (82%) clusters (including 843 HDs) and 712 singletons that were
‘unexplained’. Some include large numbers of HDs (Fig. 1). The possibility that this
distribution of unexplained HDs across the genome has been randomly generated was
excluded by simulations (P < 0.0001).

Structural signatures of HD clusters

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We compared the patterns of homozygous and hemizygous deletion over known recessive
cancer genes and fragile sites (Fig. 1). For these analyses, hemizygous deletions were
separated into two classes: small hemizygous deletions (less than 1 Mb) that require two
DNA breakage events close to each other and therefore reflect local fragility, and large
hemizygous deletions (greater than 1 Mb) that are due to several mechanisms including
whole chromosome loss (Fig. 2).
Over known recessive cancer genes there were 298 HDs and 70 small hemizygous deletions
(ratio of 4.3). In contrast, over known fragile sites there were 193 HDs and 320 small
hemizygous deletions (ratio of 0.6). The difference probably reflects the influences of
selection and mutation rate at the two classes of locus. Over recessive cancer genes the rate
of generation of small deletions is low and most do not confer selective growth advantage
because the second allele is still wild type. Therefore, small hemizygous deletions over
recessive cancer genes are rarely seen in cancer genomes. However, when converted into
HDs by loss of the other allele they confer clonal selective advantage and thus manifest
frequently.
In contrast, over fragile sites the rate of DNA breakage is high. Consequently, small
hemizygous deletions are observed in cancers, despite the fact that they do not result in
homozygous inactivation of an underlying gene. By chance, however, some are converted to
HDs by a small or a large deletion on the other parental chromosome and the observed
frequency of HDs reflects the rates of these two processes. The deepest unexplained HD
clusters observed, on chromosomes 1 (72 Mb), 3 (118 Mb), 4 (181 Mb), 8 (5 Mb), 9 (12
Mb), 16 (6 Mb) and 20 (15 Mb), are all co-located with deep clusters of small hemizygous
deletions (Fig. 1) and show a ratio of homozygous to hemizygous deletions (0.7) similar to
fragile sites.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To explore these signatures further, we examined the nature of the two deletions that
constitute each HD (Fig. 3). Over recessive cancer genes, most HDs were composed of a
large deletion on one parental chromosome and a small deletion on the other. Only 5.7%
were constituted of two small deletions. In contrast, over fragile sites 33.7% were
constituted of two small deletions, a pattern consistent with an increased rate of local
breakage. Over the deepest of the unexplained HD clusters, the fraction composed of two
small deletions was 32.6%, similar to fragile sites.
We also searched for truncating point mutations on the retained allele opposite small
hemizygous deletions by sequencing the 746 cancer cell lines through 19 known recessive
cancer genes, two genes that lie within fragile sites, and two genes that lie within clusters of
unexplained HDs. In 25% (15 out of 59) of samples with a small hemizygous deletion over a
recessive cancer gene, a truncating point mutation was found on the other allele. In contrast,
in two genes that lie within known fragile sites, FHIT (FRA3B) and WWOX (FRA16D), we
found no truncating point mutations in the retained allele opposite 149 small hemizygous
deletions (P < 0.001). Two deep unexplained HD clusters fall completely within the
genomic footprint of single genes, NEGR1 (chromosome (chr) 1, 72 Mb) and MACROD2
(chr 20, 15 Mb). Only one truncating point mutation was found in the retained allele
opposite 87 small hemizygous deletions in these two genes (1%) a similar pattern to fragile
sites (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9).
Thus, the deepest unexplained HD clusters bear structural features reminiscent of fragile
sites. Some may represent fragile sites that have previously been localized cytogenetically
but lack higher resolution mapping information. Others, however, are distant from any
known fragile site and may reflect regions with a cancer-specific propensity for DNA

double-strand breakage. To evaluate this possibility further we examined cytogenetically the
genomic regions containing unexplained HD clusters on chromosomes 3, 4, 9, 16 and 20 for
chromosome breakage in lymphoblasts under aphidicolin-induced replicative stress (Table
1). None showed evidence of fragility in this assay. Therefore, their fragility may be limited
to the internal milieu of cancer cells.

Ranking homozygous deletion clusters
At any autosomal position in the genome each sample can be classified into one of six states
(Fig. 2). The observed frequency of each state in the set of cell lines at a particular genomic
position will depend on the local small and large deletion rates and the effects of positive
and negative selection. To assess individual HD clusters, we constructed a statistical model
that allows the small deletion rate ( ) and the selection pressure relative to the average for
fragile sites (λ) to be estimated from the observed counts (Table 2 and Supplementary Table
7). These are indicators of local fragility and positive selection over recessive cancer genes
respectively.
Deletion clusters over fragile sites generally showed a high rate of small deletion and low
selection. Conversely, clusters over known recessive cancer genes had the opposite profile, a
low deletion rate with high selection. The exception to this rule was TP53. This seems to be
due to the coincidence of an exceptionally high prevalence of inactivating point mutations
(63%), leading to selection of occasional small hemizygous deletions that occur on the other
allele, coupled to a disproportionately small number of HDs over this gene.
A few unexplained HD clusters exhibited a signature indicative of a recessive cancer gene
(Table 2). The three deepest HD clusters with this pattern were over TGFBR2, CDKN2C
and CTNNA1 (Table 2 and Figs 1 and 3), all of which have been proposed previously as
recessive cancer genes but for which the evidence is incomplete.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

TGFBR2 encodes a cell-surface receptor for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). The
TGF-β-regulated pathway is frequently inactivated in cancer and TGFBR2 often exhibits
truncating somatic mutations in gastrointestinal cancers. However, these are usually
deletions or insertions at polynucleotide tracts in tumours with defective DNA mismatch
repair16, therefore their status as driver or passenger mutations has been unclear.
CDKN2C encodes p18, a cell-cycle control protein. We recently provided functional
evidence for CDKN2C as a recessive cancer gene in glioma17. However, truncating point
mutations in CDKN2C were not found previously18 and we only detected a single
homozygous protein truncating variant among 786 cancer cell lines (Supplementary Table
9).
CTNNA1 encodes α-catenin, which interacts with CDH1, the product of a known recessive
cancer gene involved in maintaining cell adhesion19. Two truncating point mutations in
CTNNA1 have previously been reported20,21 together with biological evidence supporting
its role as a recessive cancer gene22. We sequenced the coding exons of CTNNA1 through
746 cancer cell lines and 354 primary cancers. Only two proven somatic mutations were
found, in a primary renal cell cancer and a breast cancer cell line, but both are predicted to
cause premature protein truncation (Supplementary Table 9) and three further homozygous
truncating variants were found among the cell lines. Thus, for all three genes the structural
signatures of their HD clusters provide persuasive support for the otherwise inconclusive
evidence that they function as recessive cancer genes.

Discussion

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We have shown that simple structural signatures can provide clues to the dominant forces
underlying clusters of HDs. The results provide supporting evidence for TGFBR2, CTNNA1
and CDKN2C as recessive cancer genes. However, many unexplained HDs in cancer
genomes have signatures indicative of fragility. In support of this conclusion, some
unexplained HD clusters overlie gene-free regions (for example, chr 16, 6 Mb) and others
overlie genes with large genomic footprints (MACROD2, 2 Mb) a known feature of fragile
sites. Indeed, recent analyses of fibroblasts treated with aphidicolin provide independent
support for the fragility of some of the unexplained HD clusters reported here23.
Several genes located under unexplained HD clusters have been previously proposed as
recessive cancer genes. For example, PTPRD partially overlaps the deepest unexplained HD
cluster at chr 9 (12 Mb). An in vitro study has provided evidence of tumour-suppressor
activity associated with PTPRD24. However, our results indicate that this region is fragile.
Moreover, screening for truncating point mutations in PTPRD in hundreds of samples has
shown only three heterozygous truncating and a few somatic missense variants24-27, and
PTPRD knockout mice have the same cancer incidence as wild-type animals (N. Uetani and
M. L. Tremblay, personal communication).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

It is possible, however, that by coincidence some genes located in fragile regions may also
confer clonal growth advantage and contribute to cancer development when inactivated by
HDs. This has been proposed for FHIT (FRA3B) and WWOX (FRA16D) for which
knockout mice show a modestly increased tumour burden at long latency28.We did not find
evidence of more selection over FHIT and WWOX than over other fragile sites. However, it
remains possible that the low levels of positive selection conferred by HDs over these genes
are not detectable using our model. Moreover, our analysis applies exclusively to the
selective advantage conferred by biallelic inactivation of classical recessive cancer genes.
The conclusions do not pertain to putative haploinsufficient cancer genes or dominant
cancer genes that might be activated through deletions. Indeed, DNA double-strand breaks
at fragile sites may, by themselves, contribute to oncogenesis by triggering genomic
instability, without any selective advantage conferred by inactivation of genes they have
disrupted29.
The structural features that determine fragility and the underlying defects in cancer cells that
result in the accumulation of deletions over fragile sites are not well understood30. ATR is
involved in detection and repair of DNA damage occurring during replication of these
regions, and absence of ATR31 or other components of DNA double-strand break repair32,33
leads to expression of fragile sites. Because some cancer genes are known to be implicated
in DNA repair, we investigated whether fragility in the 746 cancer cell lines was associated
with cancer-causing mutations in any of the 46 known cancer genes sequenced
(Supplementary Table 4). We found no clear associations, although the gene set does not
include ATR or many of its downstream targets.
The forces of mutation and selection that shape cancer genomes are complex. Mutational
signatures remain clues that require cautious and informed interpretation in the light of all
available information. Nevertheless, with complete cancer genome sequencing on a large
scale, a realistic prospect over the next few years, increasingly informed and sophisticated
structural signatures will provide the primary, pragmatic approach to the identification of
driver mutations, after which they can be subjected to more detailed evaluation by functional
experiments.

METHODS
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Samples
Analysis was performed on 746 cancer cell lines, most of which were sourced from public
repositories, and 466 DNA samples from normal tissue (Supplementary Table 1 and http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP).

Mapping of fragile sites and known recessive cancer genes
In total, 127 fragile sites were identified from either the NCBI (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) or the literature (Supplementary Table 10), and 95 of these were
classified as common fragile sites. All the fragile sites are mapped to cytogenetic bands, the
sequence coordinates of which were obtained using Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/
Homo_sapiens/Info/Index, release 52 (December 2008)) based on the NCBI 36 assembly of
the human genome (November 2005).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Refined mapping positions were obtained from the literature for 38 of the common fragile
sites mapping to the autosomal chromosomes. Positions of these sites were mapped onto the
NCBI 36 assembly of the human genome using the mapping information (clones/genes)
present in the relevant paper. Where possible, the extent of fragile sites was taken as those
probes, distal and proximal to the fragile site that showed no indication of breakage in
metaphase chromosomes when grown under conditions of replicative stress (see
Supplementary Table 10 for a full list of the publications used). The criteria used here in
defining the fragile sites may lead to a larger apparent footprint for some fragile sites for
which refined mapping has localized the hotspot of fragility to a small genomic region
(notably FRA3B and FRA16D). However, such mapping data are not present for all fragile
sites. We have therefore used the wider definition to maintain consistency. However,
restricting the definitions of well-mapped fragile sites to hotspots of fragility was not found
to alter the results of the analysis. HD clusters were assigned to known fragile sites if they
overlapped partially or completely with the interval of the fragile site.
The list of known recessive cancer genes was taken from the Cancer Gene Census (http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/), and represents those genes known to be somatically
mutated in cancer (n = 38). Mapping positions given were obtained from Ensembl (http://
www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index, release 52 (December 2008)) based on the
NCBI 36 assembly of the human genome (November 2005).

PCR and sequencing
PCR primers were designed to amplify the exons and flanking intronic sequences of the 46
cancer genes together with two genes from known fragile sites (FHIT in FRA3B and
WWOX in FRA16D) and two genes from unexplained deletion clusters (NEGR1 and
MACROD2). PCR products were 500 bp in length, with several overlapping amplimers for
larger exons. PCR amplification of genomic DNA templates and bidirectional direct
sequencing were done as described previously35.
Sequence traces were analysed using in-house software, AutoCSA35, followed by manual
inspection of putative variants. All putative disease-causing mutations were confirmed by
bidirectional sequencing of a second independently amplified PCR product. Matched normal

cell lines were available for 40 of the cell lines. The somatic status of variants in these 40
cell lines was determined by sequencing DNA from the corresponding normal.

Classification of sequencing results for the 46 known cancer genes
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Putative oncogenic mutations are classified as either likely oncogenic mutations (LOM) or
tentative oncogenic variants (TOV). LOM are sequence changes that have previously been
shown to be somatic mutations in human cancer and/or those consistent with the position
and type of mutations for a given gene. This class includes homozygous and compound
heterozygous inactivating mutations and splice site mutations affecting positions −1, −2, +1,
+2 or +5 (where the wild-type nucleotide is a G) in tumour-suppressor genes. TOV are
inactivating mutations present as heterozygous variants in tumour-suppressor genes (other
than missense mutations in TP53 and FBXW7 that are included in the LOM class).

Multiplex PCR detection of HDs
Exon deletions in CDKN2A (p14, Ensembl transcript ID (build 52) ENST00000380150;
p16, ENST00000304494), PTEN (ENST00000371953), RB1 (ENST00000267163), STK11
(ENST00000326873), MAP2K4 (ENST00000353533) and SMAD4 (previously known as
MADH4; ENST00000342988) were identified by multiplex PCR. The primer sequences
together with PCR conditions are given in Supplementary Table 11. Control PCR amplimers
were designed for β-actin and random intergenic genomic sequences. PCR products were
resolved on 2% agarose gels. All multiplex PCR experiments were done in duplicate.

Copy number and genotype analysis
The SNP6 Genome Wide Affymetrix arrays were segmented with a Bayesian hidden
Markov model (PICNIC34, http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgp/software/PICNIC). This enabled
simultaneous identification of actual allelic copy numbers (including LOH) and genotypes.

Copy number polymorphism identification (filters)
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

DNA from normal tissue from the same individual is not available for most of the cancer
cell lines, therefore it is not possible to evaluate directly whether either single hemizygous
deletions or overlapping hemizygous deletions that give rise to a HD were somatically
acquired or were present in the germ line. To address this, we used several different analyses
to identify probable copy number polymorphisms (CNPs).
A series of 466 normal DNAs (Supplementary Table 1) was analysed and regions of copy
number alteration of less than 1 Mb were classed as CNPs. CNPs were also taken from the
ref. 36 CNP analysis of the 270 HapMap samples available from Affymetrix. These CNPs
were remapped on to build 36 of the genome. Segments within the series of cancer cell lines
that matched within ±5 features of one of these ‘known’ CNPs were flagged as CNPs.
Segments of less than 1 Mb that occurred more than once with identical boundaries within
the cancer cell line data set were also flagged as CNPs.
Some other segments within the data set were excluded from the analysis, although not
classed as CNPs. These included regions that matched (±5 features) segments of less than 30
Mb that were scored as having copy neutral LOH within the normal samples. Also,
segments of less than 1 Mb that shared (±1 feature) either the start or end of a previously
identified CNP.

Array validation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To assess the effectiveness of the CNP filters, we examined 141 putative somatic HDs found
in 40 cancer cell lines for which a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same individual is
available. Only 10 (7%) were found in the lymphoblastoid cell lines, indicating that the
filters are successful in limiting the extent of misclassification. These remaining CNPs are
rare and dispersed through the genome, and hence do not significantly influence the analysis
of HD clusters in cancer genomes.
The sensitivity and specificity of the Affymetrix SNP6 array for identification of HDs was
determined against those HDs identified by multiplex PCR. In this analysis, most of the
coding exons of six recessive cancer genes (CDKN2A, MAP2K4, PTEN, RB1, SMAD4 and
STK11) together with the CDKN2C were screened through the series of 746 cancer cell
lines (81 exons in total, of which 79 worked). Two multiplex PCR assays were also
performed for each of four of the common fragile sites (FRA3B, FRA16D, FRA6E and
FRA6F). The results from these genomic loci were compared against the HDs identified
using the SNP6 array. Of the 398 HDs identified by multiplex PCR, 327 were also detected
using the SNP6 array, giving a sensitivity of 82.2%. Of the 71 deletions not picked up by the
SNP6 array, 24 (34%) were single exon deletions. Some deletions within the SNP6 data
overlapping these loci were not identified in the multiplex analysis (n = 13), giving an
estimate for specificity of 96.2%.

Classification of genomic amplifications
A genomic amplification was defined as a region containing one or more contiguous
genomic segments defined by PICNIC34 that had a total copy number of ten or more. If an
extended region of such segments was split by a genomic segment below total copy number
of ten then this would be classed as two or more independent amplicons and counted
separately.

Statistical significance of HD clustering
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The significance of genomic clustering of HDs was assessed as follows. All deletions
occurring within the footprint of clusters involving known fragile sites and recessive cancer
genes were removed. The positions of all the deletions were randomized (ensuring that they
did not overlap the removed known clusters). For each cluster of overlapping deletions
(including occurrences of a single deletion), the genomic position of the 100-kb window that
overlapped the maximum number of deletions was obtained, and the number of overlapping
deletions recorded. This associated each cluster with an overlap statistic. This process was
repeated approximately 1,000 times to obtain the null distribution of the overlap statistics.
The significance of each overlap statistic for all the original clusters was then derived from
this distribution. To identify the clusters with significant overlap, the Benjamini–Hochberg
algorithm was used37 with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1%.

Patterns of hemizygous and homozygous deletions
To analyse patterns of deletions (both hemizygous and homozygous deletions arising from
two overlapping deletions) we classified deletions into two classes. These were small
deletions less than 1 Mb in size and large deletions greater than 1 Mb that included loss of
chromosome arms and whole chromosome loss. The cut-off was set at 1 Mb as it best
differentiated known fragile sites from known recessive cancer genes (Fig. 2). Hemizygous
deletions were defined as the loss of a genomic region from one parental chromosome
giving rise to a region of loss of heterozygosity, and included the full range of such possible

events from whole chromosome loss to small hemizygous deletions of less than 1 Mb.
Consistent with this definition, copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity was also classed
as a hemizygous deletion. However, such events did not contribute substantially to the
overall results and most hemizygous deletions were associated with a reduction in copy
number.

Modelling selection and mutation
Any cluster of homozygous or hemizygous deletions results from processes of selection and
mutation. The mutation process will generate hemizygous deletions at a locus. In some
samples both chromosomal copies at this locus will be deleted resulting in homozygous
deletion. If the region in question does not contain a recessive cancer gene, for example,
clusters arising owing to fragility, the ratio of homozygous to hemizygous deletion will be
indicative of the expected value independent of selection. Conversely, the presence of a
recessive cancer gene will mean that HDs will be observed in cancer more frequently than
expected, resulting in an increase in this ratio. The relative increase in this ratio can be used
to represent the strength of the selection at this locus. Although it is possible that
haploinsufficiency may result in a degree of selection on hemizygous deletions at recessive
cancer genes, we have made the simplifying assumption that selection at recessive cancer
genes is on HDs. Thus, selection due to haploinsufficiency has not been modelled.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To investigate these effects in more detail we have introduced a model that resolves the
deletion counts into measurements of mutation rate and relative selection pressure. In this
context, a mutation rate represents the probability that a randomly chosen chromosome from
the set of cancer cell lines will contain a deletion at a locus at completion of oncogenesis,
and the selection pressure measures the relative increase in these rates compared to the
expected. These counts were observed to be variable across the genomic footprint of
individual clusters, so the 100-kb window within each cluster overlapping the maximum
number of deletions was selected to represent the probable target of selection/fragility. The
homozygous and hemizygous deletion totals were then obtained by counting the number of
such deletions overlapping this window. To calculate selection pressure we took the average
ratio of homozygous to hemizygous deletions over all fragile sites as a benchmark. The
increase of the ratio of homozygous to hemizygous deletions of any cluster compared to this
benchmark represents the relative selection at this cluster. However, this is complicated by
two confounding factors. First, deletion rates differ depending on both the size of the
deletion and the sample in question. To adjust for the size variation we considered two
classes of deletion, depending on whether their size is smaller or larger than 1 Mb. This
results in small and large deletion rates. These have mean values (
), when averaged
across samples. We capture the variation in these rates arising from sample differences with
a dispersion parameter (ε). Second, although HDs are clearly positively selected by
recessive cancer genes, we observed that very large HDs generally tend to be selected
against, presumably due to inactivation of neighbouring genes that reduces cell viability. To
account for this we incorporated an HD selection pressure (λ) and a cell-viability parameter
(γ). We make the simplifying assumption that both of these measurements of selection are
constant across all samples. Using this model the HD selection pressure (λ) and the small
averaged deletion rate ( ) can be estimated for any HD cluster as shown in Table 2 and
Supplementary Table 7.
We now describe the model in more detail. We make the simplifying assumption that two
chromosomes are present and each chromosome can contain one of three states: no deletion
(w), a small deletion (s) or a large deletion (l). We use W, S and L to represent the

categories. The number of samples in each category can then be calculated (Fig. 2).

are unlikely to be constant across samples because different samples probably have different
rates of deletion. We capture this variance by assuming these probabilities arise from a
Dirichlet distribution:

) and ε is a dispersion

Then we construct the multinomial conditional likelihood:

Where we have:

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The deletion rate parameters , and are assumed to vary by cluster, reflecting the
inherently distinct deletion rates across clusters. The dispersion parameter captures sample
variation in these parameters and is assumed fixed across the genome.
To estimate the dispersion parameter, deletion counts from clusters over the (assumed)
selective neutral fragile sites were calculated and the empirical Bayes estimate of ε was
calculated. This was assumed to be constant in all subsequent analyses.
To extend this model to incorporate selection we proceed as follows. If C denotes the event
that a particular deletion type results in an observed cancer sample, we assume that: Pr (C|
WW) 1, Pr (C|WL) 1, Pr (C|WS) 1, Pr (C|LL) γλ, Pr (C|LS) λ and Pr (C|SS) λ.
The selection pressure parameter λ models the increased likelihood of observing HDs at
recessive cancer gene loci. The viability parameter γ models selection against large
deletions in the genome, in which the increased size of HDs may disrupt a plethora of gene

functions and negatively affect cell viability. Both these parameters are unity under a neutral
model of evolution. Then a Bayes law inversion gives us, for each cluster:

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The parameters were given uninformative priors and the maximum a priori estimates and
confidences were obtained from 100,000 Metropolis–Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo
iterations.
In particular, this produces the small deletion rate and HD selection pressure for each
cluster, as displayed in Table 2 and Supplementary Table 7.

Analysis of truncating point mutations
The observed counts of truncating point mutations of the known tumour suppressor genes
were compared to the mutation counts of the WWOX and FHIT genes within fragile sites
(allowing for differences in hemizygous status) using an exact Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel
test.

Estimation of fragility in the presence of aphidicolin

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Mapping of new fragile sites was performed on two Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed
lymphoblast cell lines (GM10851 and GM15510), obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories.
Cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 16% fetal calf serum, 100 U
ml−1 penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin. The induction of fragile sites and metaphase
preparation essentially followed ref. 38. In brief, 24 h before collection the DNA polymerase
inhibitor aphidicolin (Sigma) was added to cell cultures in the presence of 0.5% ethanol at
final concentrations of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 μM. Chromosome spreads were prepared according
to the conventional cytogenetic techniques.
Human bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) corresponding to unexplained HD clusters
and control fragile sites were chosen according to their positions in the hg17 genome
sequence assembly using the UCSC Genome Browser. All BAC clones were provided by
the clone archive team of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. BAC DNA was extracted
using the PhasePrep BAC DNA kit (Sigma) following the protocols provided by the
manufacturer.
Probe labelling, and FISH were carried out as described previously39,40. In brief, 10–20 ng
DNA from each BAC clone was first subject to a round of amplification using a wholegenome amplification kit WGA2, (Sigma), then labelled with Cy3-, Cy5-dUTP (GE
Healthcare), Spectrum Green-dUTP (Abbott Molecular) or Chromatide Texas Red-12-dUTP
(Invitrogen) using a modified whole-genome reamplification kit without dNTP WGA3
(Sigma). Approximately 100 ng of each labelled probe was used in multi-colour FISH
experiments. After post-hybridization washes, slides were mounted with SlowFade Gold
mounting solution containing DAPI (4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Invitrogen).
Metaphases were examined with a Zeiss Axioplan Imaging microscope. Images were
captured and processed with the Smart Capture software (Digital Scientific).

METHODS SUMMARY

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Analysis was performed on 746 cancer cell lines (Supplementary Table 1 and http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP). Genotyping/copy number analysis was performed
using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and expression analysis using
the HT-HU133A expression array. Copy number and genotype analysis were performed
using PICNIC34 (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Software/PICNIC/), which uses
hidden Markov models to allow estimation of absolute copy number of each parental
copy at each point in the genome. The locations of fragile sites used in this study were
obtained from the literature (Supplementary Table 10). Known cancer genes were
screened by PCR amplification/sequencing and by multiplex PCR (Supplementary Table
11). Genome fragility was assessed in metaphases derived from two lymphoblastoid lines
grown in the presence on 0.6 μM aphidicolin.

Figure 2. Deletion patterns arising from small and large hemizygous deletions

At any locus each parental chromosome can have one of three deletion states: wild type (W);
large deletion (>1 Mb, L); or small deletion (<1 Mb, S). Therefore, in principle, six
combinations can exist in a diploid genome: WW, both chromosomes are wild type; WL,
one chromosome has a large hemizygous deletion; WS, one chromosome has a small
hemizygous deletion; LL, homozygous deletion in which both chromosomes have large
overlapping deletions; LS, homozygous deletion in which one chromosome has a large
deletion overlapping a small deletion in the other; SS, homozygous deletion in which both
chromosomes have small overlapping deletions.

Small deletion rate ( p s ,%)

Homozygous and small hemizygous deletion counts (overlapping a 100-kb window) for all HD clusters with six or more HDs at recessive cancer genes (RCG), fragile sites (FRA) or unexplained loci. The
HD selection pressure (λ) is determined by comparing the ratio of the homozygous to hemizygous deletions for a cluster against the average ratio over all fragile sites. A change in this ratio represents the
relative selection at this cluster. The small deletion rate is estimated from the observed counts and is an indicator of local fragility.
