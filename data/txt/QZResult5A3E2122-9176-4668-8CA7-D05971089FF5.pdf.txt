Antiangiogenesis Agents in the Treatment of
Soft Tissue Sarcomas
Kristen Ganjoo, MD and Charlotte Jacobs, MD

Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that includes >50 different subtypes, each
with unique clinical and pathologic qualities. In general, there is a 50% cure rate, and most cures are achieved with
complete surgical resection with or without radiation therapy. The results from chemotherapeutic agents for unresectable or metastatic disease have been disappointing with minimal long-term benefit. New targeted and novel
agents are needed to improve response and survival. Tumor angiogenesis has been an intense focus in cancer therapy over the past decade. Several of numerous antiangiogenesis agents have been developed, and many already
have been approved for the treatment of both solid and liquid tumors. Certain STSs are highly vascular tumors that
often demonstrate angiogenesis markers. The objective of this review was to evaluate these angiogenesis markers in
defining the role of angiogenesis in the treatment of patients with STS. In addition, the authors conducted an indepth review of the results from using key antiangiogenesis agents in the treatment of STS. Cancer 2010;116:1177–83.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are tumors of mesenchymal origin with more than 50 different subtypes. These tumors are
uncommon, and the mainstay of treatment is complete surgical resection, with or without radiation therapy, which results
in a 50% cure rate. The outcome for patients with unresectable or metastatic disease, however, is unacceptably poor. Chemotherapeutic agents result in short-lived responses and generally do not improve survival. Novel and targeted agents are
needed to improve the outcome of these patients.
It has been demonstrated that angiogenesis plays an important role in the growth and metastasis of several solid
tumors. The response rates (RRs) to single-agent angiogenesis inhibitors generally are low; however, in combination with
chemotherapy, these agents have produced improvements in overall survival in several solid tumors, including colon cancer and lung cancer.1,2 Several of these agents have been approved for the treatment of cancer over the past decade. Angiogenesis markers can aid in defining the importance of angiogenesis in each tumor type, and several surrogate markers of
angiogenesis have been evaluated extensively.3 In this report, we update implications of these markers for outcome and
review current clinical trials with antiangiogenesis agents.
Tumor Vascularity
Microvessel density (MVD) is 1 of the first markers of angiogenesis that seem to correlate with outcome in some solid
tumors. However, the value of MVD as a prognostic factor in STS is controversial. Comandone and colleagues correlated
MVD and survival in 45 patients with extremity STS, mostly liposarcoma (LPS) and malignant fibrous histiocytoma
(MFH).4 At a median follow-up of 23 months, patients who had low MVD had improved median disease-free survival
(DFS) (24 months vs 15 months) and mean overall survival (OS) (62.7 months vs 36 months) compared with patients
who had high MVD. In contrast, West et al observed no correlation between MVD and either the metastatic rate or OS in
a study of 42 patients with extremity STS who had high-grade, deep, and large tumors (>5 cm).5 In their study, leiomyosarcoma (LMS) was the most common subtype, and it had a significantly high MVD. In addition, Saenz et al observed
that MVD, as measured by factor VIII staining, did not correlate with outcome of a series of patients with high-grade

extremity STS.6 Similar findings were reported by Yudoh
et al in biopsies from 115 patients with STS.7 Those
authors observed that MVD had no prognostic significance in these patients irrespective of subtype.
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
Another measure of angiogenesis is vascular endothelial
growth factor A (VEGF) and the receptors (VEGF-R1,
VEGF-R2, and VEGF-R3). VEGF isomer activates
VEGF-R1 (Flt-1), which is a decoy receptor and is
involved mostly in embryonic angiogenesis.8 In addition,
VEGF activates VEGF-R2 (Flk-1/KDR), which is the
most important receptor in tumor angiogenesis, promoting vascular proliferation, survival, and metastasis.
VEGF-R3 (Flt-4) is involved mostly in lymphangiogenesis, promoting lymphatic vessel proliferation and lymph
node metastasis.
The expression of tumor VEGF and high levels of
serum VEGF have been correlated with outcome in many
solid tumors, including STS. VEGF was overexpressed in
68 of 273 patients (25%) with STS in 1 study.9 Patients
who had VEGF-positive STS had a shorter OS than
patients who had VEGF-negative STS (31 month vs 45
months), although the difference did not reach statistical
significance. However, in a subgroup analysis, patients
with LMS who had VEGF-positive tumors (9 of 36
patients) had a much shorter OS (8 months vs 30 months;
P < .01) than patients who had VEGF-negative tumors.
In another study, VEGF was correlated with tumor
grade. Intermediate or high-grade tumors had a high rate
of VEGF positivity (53 of 66 tumors; 84%) compared
with 6 of 13 low-grade tumors (46%).10 VEGF expression
was correlated with grade, but it was not correlated independently with OS. Iyoda and colleagues reported the
correlation between VEGF overexpression and survival in
27 patients with STS of the thorax.11 In those patients,
the tumors were located in the lung (n ¼ 13), the chest
wall (n ¼ 9), or the mediastinum (n ¼ 5). Most patients
who had grade 3 tumors had strong overexpression of
VEGF (83%) compared with patients who had grade 1
histologies (30%). Patients with absent or faint VEGF
expression had a 5-year DFS rate of 83.3% compared
with 13.2% for those with strong VEGF expression (P <
.05). The results indicated that strong staining for VEGF
was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in patients
with STS of the thorax.
These contradictory results between studies may
reflect the lack of consistency in grading VEGF between
different pathologists. Measurements of serum VEGF lev-

1178

els may avoid these variations. Graeven and colleagues
evaluated serum VEGF levels in 85 patients with STS
before surgical resection.12 In addition, 33 patients had
samples evaluated 3 weeks after surgery. High serum
VEGF levels were correlated strongly with tumor grade
and mass, with the highest levels observed in poorly differentiated tumors. It is noteworthy that serum VEGF levels
did not change in the 33 patients who had samples drawn
3 weeks after surgery. The authors attributed this to
wound healing and concluded that the levels should have
been measured a few months after surgery.
Inhibitors of Angiogenesis
There are several ways to inhibit angiogenesis in STS,
including blocking of VEGF, VEGF receptors, tyrosine
kinase downstream signaling pathways, and endothelial
inhibition. The treatment of STS with antiangiogenesis
agents is relatively recent; thus, the results from most of
the studies mentioned below have not been published but
have been reported only at national meetings.
Antivascular endothelial growth
factor antibodies

Bevacizumab (Bev) (Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif) is a humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody. In theory, chemotherapy delivery to areas of high
tumor vascularity could be compromised because of high
interstitial pressure of deranged vessels. Antiangiogenesis
agents could normalize the interstitial pressure by blocking the proliferation of tumor blood vessels. Although it
has low activity as a single agent, when it was given with
chemotherapy, Bev improved survival and/or RRs of
patients with colon, nonsmall cell lung, and breast cancers
in randomized studies.1,2,13 Currently, Bev is approved
for these cancers in combination with chemotherapy.
Single-agent doxorubicin is currently the standard
of care for the treatment of patients with STS and has produced RRs of 20% to 25%. Although combination therapies with other agents, mostly ifosfamide, increase RR,
they have failed to demonstrate an improvement in OS. A
phase 2 study of Bev combined with doxorubicin was conducted by D’Adamo et al14 In that study, 17 patients
received doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 intravenous (iv) push and
Bev 15 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks for up to 11 cycles (range,
1-11 cycles) followed by Bev maintenance. Dexrazoxane
was administered after a total of 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. Eleven of those 17 patients had LMS mostly of uterine origin. The RR was 12% (2 partial responses [PRs];
95% confidence interval, 1%-36%) with a median OS of

16 months. Six of 17 patients experienced cardiomyopathy, and it was unclear whether this was because of high
doses of doxorubicin or because of the combination therapy. Cardiac toxicities have been reported for Bev/doxorubicin combinations. In a retrospective study, pegylated
doxorubicin was administered with Bev to 20 patients
with STS but resulted in an RR of only 15%.15 These disappointing results with RRs lower than those achieved
with single-agent doxorubicin may be attributed to poor
patient selection. Clearly, better therapeutic agents are
needed to improve response and outcome in STS.
More recently, the combination of gemcitabine (G)
and docetaxel (D) has become attractive in STS, because
an RR of 53% was reported in uterine LMS, and the combination also demonstrated activity in other STS.16,17 Bev
has been combined with G and D in a phase 1/2 study in
patients with previously untreated STS.18 G was administered at doses of 1000 mg/m2, 1250 mg/m2, or 1500
mg/m2 in escalating cohorts; D was administered at a
dose of 50 mg/m2; and Bev was administered at a dose of
5 mg/kg. All drugs were given at 2-week intervals until
patients experienced unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Seven of 23 patients received this combination
as neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. Patients were
assessable if 2 full treatments were given, and the recommended dose was G 1500 mg/m2, D 50 mg/m2, and Bev
5 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The overall RR was 40% with 3
complete responses (2 angiosarcoma [AS] and 1 MFH)
and 5 PRs (1 MFH, 2 LMS, 2 others). Grade 4 toxicities
included pneumothorax and bowel perforation (4%
each). There was no grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity;
however, it is unclear whether granulocyte growth factors
were given. A randomized study needs to be done to
clearly define the additive effect of Bev. A selection of
available trials with Bev in STS is summarized in Table 1.
Small-molecule vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors

Sunitinib (Sutent; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) is a
multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It binds to
the adenosine-triphosphate domain of kit and plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). It also blocks
Flt-3, neurotrophic factor receptor, and colony-stimulating factor-1. In addition, it has antiangiogenesis activity
by blocking VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, and VEGF-R3. This
property is not shared by imatinib. The RR to sunitinib
has been evaluated in 36 patients with nongastroinstestinal stromal tumor (non-GIST) STS (12 LMS, 12 LPS, 11
MFH, 1 fibrosarcoma).19 The drug was well tolerated,

although 1 patient developed congestive heart failure, and
1 patient developed pulmonary emboli. There was 1 PR,
and 29 of 36 patients had stable disease (SD) for at least
12 weeks. In another phase 2 study, patients were grouped
based on their histology with (Group 1) or without
(Group 2) a known prior response to TKI.20 Eleven of 20
patients in the first group had SD, including 5 patients
with LMS and 1 patient with AS, 3 of which were sustained at the Week 16 follow-up. There was 1 PR in the
second group that was sustained at Week 32. SD was
observed in 6 of 19 patients, and 4 of those patients
remained stable at Week 16. There are multiple phase 2
studies ongoing with sunitinib in STS (Table 1).
Sorafenib (Nexavar: Onyx, Emeryville, Calif and
Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) is also a multitargeted TKI.
It specifically inhibits Raf, PDGFR, VEGF-R2, VEGFR3, and c-kit. An attractive mechanism of action of sorafenib is simultaneous targeting of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathways. Two phase 2 studies have been reported with singleagent sorafenib in STS. In the first study, patients
who had different subtypes were entered in 6 groups, each
with a separate Simon 2-stage design, depending on
response.21 Patients received sorafenib at 400 mg orally
twice a day. Two of 37 patients (6%) with LMS had a PR
with a median time to progression of 5.2 months. Five of
37 patients (14%) with AS had a response (4 PRs, 1 complete response) with a median time to progression of 5.5
months. Although 78 of 122 patients (64%) needed a
dose reduction, the steady-state pharmacokinetics were
similar between full dosed and dose-reduced patients.
Two fatalities were reported because of hemorrhage and
intestinal perforation. Grade 3 or 4 hypertension and cardiomyopathy also were observed.
In an intergroup study (Southwest Oncology Group
study 0505), 37 patients received sorafenib; and, although
there were no confirmed responses, 7 of 9 patients with
vascular tumors had SD with a median progression-free
survival (PFS) of 4.7 months and median OS of 13.5
months.22 The most common adverse events were fatigue,
diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome. Currently, there are
multiple trials ongoing with sorafenib in combination
with chemotherapy and/or radiation in STS (Table 1).
Dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New
York, NY) is another multiple TKI with unique qualities.
Dasatinib inhibits PDGFR, epidermal growth factor
receptor, VEGF-R2, and cellular focal adhesion kinase.
The Src family results in over activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which subsequently increases VEGF
expression through tumor hypoxia.23,24 It has been

demonstrated that dasatinib inhibits Src in 12 human sarcoma cell lines and subsequently inhibits cell migration
and invasion.25 A cooperative group study is ongoing in
the Sarcoma Alliance of Research through Collaboration
to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of dasatinib in STS
and osteosarcoma. Combination studies also are under
way (Table 1).
Pazopanib (GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, Pa) is a
new multi-TKI that blocks VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2,
VEGF-R3, PDGFR, and c-kit. This drug has demonstrated activity in other solid tumors. A phase 2 study was
reported in intermediate or high-grade, metastatic or
advanced STS.26 The primary endpoint was PFS at 12
weeks. The drug was given orally at 800 mg daily to 4
groups of patients with STS stratified by histology. At 12
weeks, 27 of 80 patients were progression free. Clinical
benefit was observed in patients with LMS, in patients
with synovial sarcoma, and in the miscellaneous group,

1180

but not in patients with LPS. A randomized study with
pazopanib versus placebo is ongoing in STS because of
the encouraging phase 2 results (Table 1).
Thalidomide

Thalidomide is an oral agent that changes the microenvironment of the tumor through cytokines. Thalidomide also improves the oxygenation of the tumor vascular
bed during the first few days and sensitizes the tumor to
radiation therapy.27 In addition, it inhibits VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor, leading to inhibition of angiogenesis. In 1 clinical trial, 29 patients with refractory
uterine LMS received thalidomide, and 24% experienced
stabilization of disease.28 The median PFS of 1.9 months
was disappointing, and the median OS was 8.3 months. It
is worth noting that the most common grade 3 adverse
events were neurologic toxicity and dyspnea. Thalidomide
in combination with temozolomide has been evaluated in

Cancer

a phase 2 study in patients with unresectable or metastatic
LMS.29 Temozolomide was given at a dose of 150 mg/m2
daily for 7 days followed by 1 week off and thalidomide at
200 mg daily. The RR was 10%, and 24% of patients
achieved SD. Thalidomide had to be dose reduced or discontinued in many patients because of toxicity. The role
of thalidomide in patients with STS is unclear. A phase 2
combination therapy study is ongoing (Table 1).
Taxanes

Paclitaxel is a taxane that inhibits microtubular assembly. This drug has antiangiogenesis effects by inhibiting endothelial motility and proliferation as well as
invasiveness.30 The drug also lowers the interstitial pressure and induces endothelial apoptosis.31 In general,
paclitaxel has not been effective in STS with the exception of AS. A prospective study of paclitaxel in AS (the
ANGIOTAX study) was reported for patients with unresectable AS.32 Paclitaxel was administered over 60
minutes at a dose of 80 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. The primary endpoint was the nonprogression rate after 2 cycles. Thirty patients with AS were
treated, including 10 patients who had AS of the breast.
Ten patients had radiotherapy-induced AS, including 9
patients who had a history of breast adenocarcinoma.
The nonprogression rate at 2 months was 74%, and 5 of
27 evaluable patients had a PR (18%). It is noteworthy
that 3 patients were able to undergo complete resection
of their residual tumor, and 2 of 3 patients currently are
alive with no evidence of disease. Combination studies
with other chemotherapeutic agents are ongoing (Table
1). This is a great example of selecting a drug that is suitable for a specific sarcoma subtype.
Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) controls the production of HIF-a and HIF-b (hypoxia inducible factor), which, as transcription factors, mediate the
expression of several angiogenic genes. These genes produce VEGF and angiopoietin-2, which, in turn, form new
blood vessels and new vessel extensions or sprouting.33 In
addition, mTOR plays a role in cell proliferation, motility, metabolism, adhesion, and survival.33-35
There are several mTOR inhibitors in clinical
trial for sarcomas, notably, ridaforolimus (deforlimus;
AP23573), everolimus (RAD 001), and temsirolimus
(CCI-779). Oral ridaforolimus (AP23573; Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass) has been evaluated in a
phase 1 study that included 85 patients with recurrent or

Cancer

refractory sarcoma.36 A clinical benefit response (SD or
better) was reported in 23 of 85 patients (27%). The
dose-limiting toxicity was aphthous, ulcer-like mouth
sores, but it was well tolerated otherwise. A large, prospective phase 2 trial of AP23573 in STS revealed a clinical
benefit rate of 29% (n ¼ 212).37 The authors of that study
suggested that patients who achieve a clinical benefit have
an improved OS. In contrast, a phase 2 trial of CCI-779
in STS failed to demonstrate meaningful efficacy in 41
patients with advanced STS.38
To establish the role of these agents in STS, a phase
3 trial with AP23573 has been initiated in patients with
metastatic soft tissue or bone sarcomas. The SUCCEED
(Sarcoma Multicenter Clinical Evaluation of the Efficacy
of Ridaforolimus) trial is a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study evaluating the PFS and OS in
patients who have achieved a good response after
chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
This is the era for angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer therapy. The importance of these agents in STS treatment has
been highlighted in this article. Most antiangiogenesis
agents do not have single-agent activity according to
standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST).39 These tumor measurements are 1-dimensional, and the tumor activity measured by positron emission tomography scanning is not taken into account with
RECIST. However, the Choi criteria measure tumor density as well as size to assess response and currently is the
accepted method of response assessment in patients with
GIST.40 The Choi criteria are more sensitive than
RECIST and are correlated significantly with the time to
progression and disease-specific survival.41 It is possible
that the response to antiangiogenesis agents should be
measured according to Choi criteria, because some
patients benefit clinically but have no response according
to RECIST. Sarcoma researchers should attempt to standardize the assessment of these agents not only in terms of
criteria for response but also in terms of what constitutes a
meaningful response.
Antiangiogenesis agents should be combined with
other novel or chemotherapeutic agents to improve
response. Antiangiogenesis agents can stabilize the interstitial pressure of the tumor vasculature and allow
better chemotherapy delivery to the tumor bed. Ultimately, randomized studies are needed to demonstrate
the benefit of angiogenesis inhibitors combined with

1181

Review Article

chemotherapy. However, STSs are uncommon cancers,
and large studies are difficult to complete. Therefore, it
may be impossible to demonstrate the kinds of small
and meaningful benefits that have been produced in
lung or colon cancer studies.
It is premature to speculate which inhibitors appear
most promising. One major impediment is the large number of STS histologic subtypes, each with different tumor
characteristics and clinical behaviors. Not all subtypes
would be expected to respond to an antiangiogenesis
approach, and different types may respond to different
inhibitors. Targeted agents must be identified individually for specific subtypes to maximize results. Trials
should focus on sarcoma subtypes with a likely possibility
to respond to angiogenesis inhibitors. MVD or VEGF
may prove to be prognostic factors in certain STS types,
such as LMS, and efforts should be made to investigate
this further. However, it has not yet been determined
whether MVD or VEGF will predict response to these
antiangiogenesis agents. This has not been the case in
other malignancies.
Angiogenesis inhibitors provide a new and exciting
therapeutic option for patients with STS. The angiogenesis pathway in STS needs to be explored further to identify
the most effective agent for specific STS subtypes.
