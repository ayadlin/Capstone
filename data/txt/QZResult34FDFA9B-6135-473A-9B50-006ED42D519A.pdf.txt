BACKGROUND: Tasisulam sodium (hereafter, tasisulam) is a novel anticancer agent that induces apoptosis through
the intrinsic pathway and has antiangiogenic activity in preclinical models. Tasisulam demonstrated activity across a
broad range of tumors, including melanoma. The primary objective of this phase 2 study was to determine the objective response rate (ORR) in patients who had received 1 previous systemic chemotherapy for unresectable/metastatic
melanoma; secondary objectives were to evaluate the clinical response rate (CRR), progression-free survival (PFS),
overall survival (OS), duration of response, safety, and pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Tasisulam was administered
intravenously on Day 1 of 21-day cycles according to a lean body weight-based dosing algorithm targeting a peak
plasma concentration (Cmax) of 420 lg/mL. RESULTS: In 68 enrolled patients, the median age was 59 years (range,
26-83 years). No patients had a complete response (CR), 8 patients had a partial response (PR), and 24 patients had
stable disease (SD); the ORR (CR þ PR) was 11.8%, and the CRR (CR þ PR þ SD) was 47.1%. The median PFS was 2.6
months, and the median OS was 9.6 months. The predominant treatment-related grade 3/4 toxicity was thrombocytopenia (20.6% of patients). Tasisulam exhibited a biexponential disposition with a predicted distribution half-life of
0.3 hours to 2.8 hours and a median terminal elimination half-life of 10 days (consistent with the turnover of albumin),
suggesting that tasisulam is very tightly bound to albumin. CONCLUSIONS: Tasisulam administered at a targeted
Cmax of 420 lg/mL on Day 1 of 21-day cycles demonstrated activity and tolerable toxicity as second-line treatment in
C 2011
malignant melanoma. These results led to a registration trial in metastatic melanoma. Cancer 2011;117:4732–9. V

The incidence of melanoma has increased faster than that for any other cancer, with more than 160,000 new cases per

year worldwide and an estimated 68,720 cases in the United States in 2009.1,2 The median survival of patients with stage
IV disease is approximately 6 months, <10% of patients achieve long-term survival, and only 6% survive to 5 years.3,4

Phase 2 Study of Tasisulam in Melanoma/Kirkwood et al

Several new agents recently have been evaluated in
phase 3 trials. Oblimersen is a proapoptotic antisense oligonucleotide that targets Bcl-2. When combined with dacarbazine, which is a standard of care for metastatic
melanoma, oblimerson significantly improved progressionfree survival (PFS) (2.6 months vs 1.6 months; P < .001)
and the response rate (13.5% vs 7.5%; P ¼ .007) versus
dacarbazine alone in chemonaive patients with advanced
melanoma, but it did not improve overall survival (OS) (9.0
months vs 7.8 months; P ¼ .077).5 Sorafenib, a multikinase
inhibitor, has demonstrated modest activity as a single agent
in advanced melanoma.6 When added to carboplatin and
paclitaxel as first-line or second-line therapy in phase 3 trials,
no added PFS or OS benefit was observed over carboplatin/
paclitaxel.7,8 In addition, temozolomide, an oral alkylating
agent that has been investigated in metastatic melanoma,
offers little evidence of improved efficacy over dacarbazine.3
Tasisulam sodium (benzamide, N-[(5-bromo2-thienyl)sulfonyl]-2,4-dichloro-sodium salt [hereafter
referred to as tasisulam]) is a novel acylsulfonamide antineoplastic agent.9 When it was evaluated in vitro against
60 cell lines (including leukemia, melanoma, nonsmall
cell lung cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, and breast cancer) in a National Cancer Institute
(NCI) COMPARE analysis,10 the activity profile of tasisulam appeared unique. Data from preclinical in vitro
studies suggest that tasisulam promotes apoptosis of
tumor cells11 through the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway and blocks G2/M phase of the cell cycle; however, the
precise cellular target remains under investigation. Tasisulam also has demonstrated antiangiogenic activity in preclinical models of angiogenesis (Eli Lilly and Company,
Indianapolis, Ind; data on file).
A recently conducted phase 1 study of tasisulam
revealed significant intrapatient/interpatient variability in
patient tolerability, tasisulam plasma concentration (Cmax)
with repeated flat dosing, and an unexpectedly high degree
of albumin binding (range, 99.7%-99.9%).12 Dosing
modifications implemented during that study included
doses that were based on lean body weight (LBW),13 with
the administration of a loading dose in Cycle 1 followed by
a lower chronic dose in later cycles. Altogether, these
changes reduced pharmacokinetic (PK) variability and
allowed the determination of a maximum tolerated dose
for tasisulam (targeted Cmax of 420 lg/mL),12 which was
brought forward into phase 2 development.
The primary objective of the current phase 2 study
was to assess the objective response rate (ORR) in patients
who received 1 prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimen

for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Secondary
objectives were to assess the clinical response rate (CRR),
PFS, OS, duration of response, PK, and the safety of tasisulam in this patient population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patients aged 18 years with a histologically or cytologically documented diagnosis of malignant melanoma that
was unresectable or metastatic were eligible to participate
in this study. Patients had to have a performance status of
0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale
and adequate bone marrow, kidney, and liver functions.
Patients must have received 1 previous systemic chemotherapeutic regimen. An immunotherapy or antibodybased regimen (including vaccination-based treatment)
was not considered prior treatment for determining study
eligibility unless it was combined with a chemotherapeutic
regimen for melanoma. At least 4 weeks before study enrollment, discontinuation of and recovery from all previous
therapies (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or other
investigational therapy) was required. Patients’ serum albumin levels had to be 30 g/L (3.0 g/dL). Patients who had
active brain metastasis (documented central nervous system
or leptomeningeal metastasis) at study entry or who were
actively receiving warfarin therapy (2 patients who were
receiving warfarin in phase 1 had an elevated prothrombin
time [PT]/international normalized ratio [INR],12 and warfarin appears to compete for the same albumin-binding site)
were excluded from study participation.
Written informed consent was obtained from each
patient before study participation. The study was
approved by institutional review board(s) and was conducted according to applicable laws and regulations, good
clinical practices, and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Treatment Plan and Dose Adjustments
In this open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, tasisulam
was supplied by Eli Lilly and Company as a lyophilized
formulation containing 500 mg of tasisulam sodium. Tasisulam was reconstituted with 20 mL of sterile water for
injection (final concentration, 25 mg/mL) and was stored
at room temperature for up to 24 hours. This compound
was administered as an intravenous infusion over 2 hours
(10 minutes) at a targeted Cmax dose of 420 lg/mL on
Day 1 of 21-day cycles. A loading dose was administered
in Cycle 1 and was followed by a chronic dose of 65% of

4733

Original Article

the loading dose in subsequent cycles. Amendments to the
study are ongoing and are exploring alternative dosing
regimens of tasisulam.
To receive additional cycles of treatment beyond
Cycle 1, a patient’s absolute neutrophil count and platelet
count had to be 1.0  109/L and 100  109/L,
respectively. All nonhematologic toxicities had to recover
to grade 0/1 or to the baseline value according to the NCI
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE) (version 3.0, 2003). Treatment could be
delayed up to 3 weeks; if it was delayed for >3 weeks,
then the patient was removed from the study.
Dose adjustments after Cycle 1 were allowed for
patients who developed unacceptable toxicity based on
nadir counts, nonhematologic toxicity, or other severe,
drug-related events from the preceding course of therapy.
Dose reductions based on nadir counts were 75% of the
chronic dose for platelets <50  109/L and/or absolute
neutrophils <1.0  109/L for 7 days. Dose reductions
were also 75% of the chronic dose for febrile neutropenia,
neutropenic sepsis, or grade 3 (or severe) nonhematologic
toxicities, and 50% of the chronic dose for grade 4 nonhematologic toxicities (except nausea and vomiting, alopecia, or allergic reaction for grades 3 and 4). Dose
omissions were not permitted during the trial.
Baseline and Treatment Assessments
A physical examination, tumor measurement of palpable
or visual lesions, and recording of performance status
were performed at baseline and at every cycle. Prealbumin, coagulation tests (PT/INR and activated partial
thromboplastin time [aPTT]), and urinalyses were performed at baseline; and complete blood counts and serum
chemistry were performed at baseline, before each cycle,
and post-therapy. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms were
conducted at baseline, during Cycles 1 and 2, and posttherapy. Radiologic imaging (computed tomography
scans or magnetic resonance imaging) was conducted at
baseline and at every other cycle to assess response to
treatment.
Data from all patients who received 1 dose of
study drug were included in the efficacy analyses. The
ORR (investigator determined) was based on patients’
best response across the study treatment cycles and was calculated as the number of responders (complete responses
[CR] þ partial responses [PR])/number of patients who
received 1 dose of tasisulam. The CRR was calculated as
the number of patients who were free from progression
(CR þ PR þ stable disease [SD]) for 2 cycles/number of

4734

patients who received 1 dose of tasisulam. Response rates
were determined according to the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines.14
The duration of response was measured from the
date of CR or PR to first date of documented progressive
disease or death and was censored at the date of the last
assessment visit for responders who remained alive and
did not have documented progressive disease. PFS was
measured from the date of the first dose to disease progression or death and was censored at the date of last contact
for patients who remained alive and did not progress. OS
was measured from the date of the first dose to death and
was censored at the date of last contact for patients who
remained alive.
Data from all patients who received 1 dose of
study drug were included in the safety analyses. Safety
analyses included summaries of CTCAE grades for laboratory and nonlaboratory parameters, treatment-emergent
adverse events, and dose adjustments. Treatment-related
toxicity was based on investigator assessment as possibly
related to study drug.
PK Evaluations
To evaluate the PK parameters of tasisulam, blood samples were collected at the following time points: predose,
end of infusion, and 2 hours after the end of infusion on
Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 and 2 and predose and after
the end of infusion in subsequent cycles. Because this
study had a sparse PK data collection strategy, a population PK analysis approach was adopted using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling program NONMEM (version
6) with PREDPP (Version V),15 and the results from this
study were combined with results from the previous phase
1 study.12 The PK model used to characterize tasisulam
was a 2-compartment total drug model that was parameterized in terms of a clearance, initial volume of distribution, peripheral volume of distribution, and
intercompartmental clearance.
Statistical Considerations
The primary objective of the study was to determine the
ORR. In patients with second-line, metastatic melanoma,
a 10% response rate was considered sufficient to warrant
further study. Approximately 60 patients were planned to
be enrolled in the study to allow for at least 50 patients to
complete the first on-study radiologic imaging assessment
at the end of Cycle 2. If the true ORR (CR or PR) was
10%, then there was an approximately a 60% probability

peripheral sensory neuropathy (1 patient; Cycle 8) and
thrombocytopenia (2 patients; Cycle 3). Toxicities that
resulted in dose delays were injection site irritation, rash,
and infusion site pain (1 patient each; Cycle 1); dose
delays did not result in discontinuation from the study.
The most common treatment-related toxicity overall
was fatigue, which occurred in 28 patients (41.2%), and
most nonhematologic toxicities were grade 1/2 (Table 3).
The predominant grade 3/4 toxicity was hematologic,
namely, thrombocytopenia (20.6% of patients) followed
by neutropenia (16.2% of patients) (Table 3). Another
patient had grade 4 leukopenia. Two patients developed
treatment-related febrile neutropenia (grades 1 and 3, respectively). Thirteen patients required 1 or more transfusions
while on study (packed red blood cells [11 patients], platelets
[7 patients], and/or fresh frozen plasma [1 patient]). Treatment-related bleeding (grade 1) occurred in 1 patient. There
was no treatment-related grade 3 of 4 nausea or vomiting.
Four patients were discontinued from treatment because
of adverse events (all treatment-related): grade 4 thrombocytopenia (Cycle 1), grade 3 fatigue (Cycle 3), grade 3
sensory neuropathy (Cycle 8), and grade 4 aspiration
(associated with pneumonia, Cycle 5). The thrombocytopenia and aspiration required hospitalization.
Two patients died during the study from adverse
events. One patient was hospitalized for abdominal pain
and renal failure and was thought to have had an abdominal catastrophe with tumor and/or bowel infarction. The
cause of death in that patient was reported as abdominal
catastrophe and cardiac collapse secondary to multisystem
failure (Cycle 13), and the investigator could not exclude

the possibility of relatedness to the study drug. The other
patient who died was hospitalized for management of
grade 3 stomatitis, anemia, and hypotension. Evaluation
revealed renal failure, acidosis, and hyperkalemia; and renal ultrasound revealed bilateral hydronephrosis and a
large pelvic mass. The patient then developed hematemesis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a bleeding gastric ulcer and findings consistent with gastric metastases.
The bleeding was not associated with thrombocytopenia.
The cause of death was reported as acute gastrointestinal
bleed (main event), hyperkalemia (contributing cause),
and multiorgan failure (Cycle 1). The investigator considered these events unrelated to the study drug; however,
the sponsor upgraded the gastrointestinal bleed to possibly related to study drug because of the temporal relationship with study drug administration and the potential
antiangiogenesis activity of the drug. One additional
patient died during the study from metastatic melanoma.
Four patients died from metastatic melanoma
within 30 days after discontinuing treatment. Thirty-six
patients died after 30 days of treatment discontinuation,
including 33 patients who died of metastatic melanoma, 1
patient who died of another cause, and 2 patients who
died for unknown reasons.
PK Analyses
Consistent with previous findings,12 the current study
indicated that tasisulam has a biexponential disposition
pattern with a predicted distribution half-life ranging
from 0.3 hours to 2.8 hours and a median terminal elimination half-life of 10 days, consistent with the turnover rate

4737

Original Article

of albumin (9-12 days).17 The total plasma clearance of
approximately 0.027 L per hour was low, and the volume
of distribution at steady state probably was limited to the
distribution volume of albumin (approximately 8-10 L;
data not shown).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first article to summarize
results from a phase 2 study of tasisulam, a novel antitumor
agent that appears to have a unique mechanism of action.10
In this study of 68 patients, tasisulam was administered every 21 days using an innovative dosing paradigm that was
developed in a phase 1 trial12 in which the dose was based
on LBW and a targeted Cmax of 420 lg/mL.
Of the 68 evaluable patients in the current study,
the ORR was 11.8%, and 8 patients achieved a PR. In
total, 24 patients had SD, for a CRR of 47.1%. Eleven
patients received at least 10 cycles of tasisulam before disease progression. Although only 8 patients were classified
as responders (CR or PR), waterfall plot analyses indicated
that 30 of the 64 patients (47%) who had complete baseline and postbaseline tumor assessments had some tumor
reduction, indicating a potential clinical benefit from
therapy with tasisulam despite the lack of formal PR criteria. In the current study, the median PFS was 2.6 months,
and the median OS was 9.6 months.
The most frequent treatment-related toxicities were
associated with bone marrow suppression; namely, grade
3/4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, and grade 3
fatigue was the most common nonhematologic toxicity.
Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic treatment-related toxicity
was relatively uncommon. There were no reports of grade
3 or 4 nausea or vomiting.
Metastatic melanoma remains a challenge to medical oncologists. To date, no agent has been approved for
the treatment of melanoma on the basis of improved OS
after failure of front-line treatment. Whereas during the
conduct of the present trial there were no phase 3 trials
showing improvement in PFS or OS compared with best
supportive care, the US Food and Drug Administrationapproved agents for glioblastoma, dacarbazine and temozolomide, are used commonly in first-line treatment of
metastatic melanoma in the European Union and the
United States,3,18 respectively. In addition, fotemustine is
used in certain countries,19 including Australia. Results
from the current study are encouraging, because the
cohort treated was composed of patients who received 1
prior systemic chemotherapy without benefit, and dem-

onstrate response rates that compare favorably with antitumor response rates in first-line therapy, with a tolerable
safety profile.
Historically, phase 2 studies have evaluated the
objective tumor response rate; and, to date, that rate has
not been correlated with a meaningful survival benefit. As
recently reported,20 the phase 3 trial of the anti-CTLA4
blocking antibody, ipilimumab (MDX 020), has shown a
significant reduction in mortality (HR ¼ 0.66), but a
response rate of only 5% to 10% in metastatic melanoma.
A recent meta-analysis of cooperative group trials in metastatic melanoma from 1975 to 2005 suggests that a
6-month PFS rate of 15% and a 1-year OS rate of 25%
were reasonable benchmarks for success for a phase 2
study.21 By these standards, this study provides encouraging results, and the observed antitumor activity of tasisulam (6-month PFS rate of 24% and 1-year OS rate of
36%) provide a rationale for further study.
In conclusion, tasisulam administered at a targeted
Cmax of 420 lg/mL on Day 1 of 21-day cycles demonstrated antitumor activity and tolerable toxicity as secondline treatment in patients with metastatic melanoma. The
results of this trial led to the initiation (in December
2009) of a phase 3 registration trial of tasisulam versus
paclitaxel in patients with metastatic melanoma who had
received 1 prior regimen of dacarbazine-based or temozolomide-based chemotherapy.
