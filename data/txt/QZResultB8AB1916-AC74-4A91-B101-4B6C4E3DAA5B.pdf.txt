BACKGROUND: A retrospective meta-analysis of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was performed to determine if differences in outcome exist following treatment on pediatric versus adult oncology treatment regimens.
METHODS: Outcomes were compared of 517 AYAs with AML aged 16 to 21 years who were treated on Children’s Oncology Group
(COG), Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) frontline AML trials from 1986 to 2008.
RESULTS: There was a significant age difference between AYA cohorts in the COG, CALGB, and SWOG trials (median, 17.2 versus 20.1
versus 19.8 years, P <.001). The 10-year event-free survival of the COG cohort was superior to the combined adult cohorts (38% 6 6%
versus 23% 6 6%, log-rank P 5.006) as was overall survival (45% 6 6% versus 34% 6 7%), with a 10-year estimate comparison of
P 5.026. However, the younger age of the COG cohort is confounding, with all patients aged 16 to 18 years doing better than those
aged 19 to 21 years. Although the 10-year relapse rate was lower for the COG patients (29% 6 6% versus 57% 6 8%, Gray’s P <.001),
this was offset by a higher postremission treatment-related mortality of 26% 6 6% versus 12% 6 6% (Gray’s P <.001). Significant
improvements in 10-year event-free survival and overall survival were observed for the entire cohort in later studies. CONCLUSIONS:
Patients treated on pediatric trials had better outcomes than those treated on adult trials, but age is a major confounding variable,

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) affects patients of all ages, and survival rates in general decrease with advancing age; many
factors might contribute to this fact. Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with AML are cared for by both pediatric and
adult oncologists, with dose intensity higher in pediatrics. AYAs with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved
survival when treated on pediatric treatment regimens compared to regimens designed for older adults.1,2
Two small preliminary studies have addressed whether AYAs have better outcomes on pediatric or adult AML trials.
AYAs treated on one Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) trial3 did better than AYAs treated with adult therapies at the MD
Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC),4 but the CCG patients were younger than those at MDACC. Patients younger than
21 years treated at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and MDACC demonstrated that survival decreased with advancing age, with minimum examination of results by treatment regimens.5
This report compares the relative effectiveness of adult and pediatric AML therapy in AYA patients using data from
Children’s Oncology Group (COG), Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), and Southwest Oncology Group
(SWOG) frontline studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All patients provided informed consent according to federal and institutional guidelines and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All COG, CALGB, and SWOG studies included in this analysis were performed using protocols

approved by institutional review board. The later studies
were registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov since its inception in 2000.
Childhood Trials

A total of 281 patients aged 16 to 21 years were enrolled
on CCG-2861,6 CCG-2891,3,7 CCG-2941,8 CCG2961,9 and COG AAML03P110 studies from 1986 to
2008, with details in the references and Table 1. The first
4 trials each used an “intensive-timing” induction, and for
postremission therapy compared outcomes of patients
receiving aggressive high-dose cytarabine, and in 2 cases
autologous transplantation, to those assigned to allogeneic
blood or marrow transplantation (BMT). In COG
AAML03P1, induction was intensified using a UK Medical Research Council approach.11
Adult Trials

During 1986 to 2008, 149 patients aged 16 to 21 years
were enrolled on sequential CALGB trials for newly diagnosed AML, including CALGB 8525,12 CALGB 9022,13
CALGB 9222,14 CALGB 9621,15 and CALGB 19808.16
All used daunorubicin/cytarabine-based induction and
high-dose cytarabine-based intensification. In the
CALGB 9621 and CALGB 19808 trials, autologous
transplantation was performed in patients without corebinding factor cytogenetics, with no allogeneic transplants
offered. SWOG enrolled 87 AYAs on 3 frontline trials for
AML from 1986 to 2008: SWOG 8600,17 SWOG
9500,18 and SWOG S0106.19 All studies used daunorubicin and cytarabine, and in one case, this therapy plus gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Neither autologous nor allogeneic
transplantation were offered except that allogeneic transplantation be considered for patients with high-risk cytogenetics and a matched sibling donor in SWOG S0106.
Statistical Analysis

CCG-2861 was current as of September 21, 2001,
CCG-2891 was current as of January 14, 2004; CCG2961, November 6, 2009; CCG-2941, April 14, 2005;
and COG AAML03P1, May 12, 2010. Data from
CALGB and SWOG studies were current as of June 28,
2010, and May 12, 2010, respectively. The significance of
observed differences in proportions was tested using the
chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test when data were
sparse. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine
the significance between differences in median values.
Study entry characteristics analyzed included sex, white
blood cell count, bone marrow blasts percentage, FAB
(French-American-British) classification, and weightCancer

related groups defined by body mass index (BMI) percentage. Median times from diagnosis to study entry for
the COG, CALGB, and SWOG studies were 1, 1, and 2
days, respectively. Race and ethnicity were not analyzed
due to differences in data collection among the groups.
Weight groups were defined as either underweight
(BMI < 11%), middleweight (11%-94%), or overweight
(BMI  95%) using accepted American standards. For cytogenetics, patients were classified as per the Byrd classification system20 as favorable [t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16)],
adverse [complex karyotype  3 abnormalities, inv(3) or
t(3;3), t(6;9), t(6;11), 27, 18 sole or with one other abnormality not favorable, or t(11;19)], or intermediate (all
others).
Overall survival (OS) was defined as time from study
entry to death. Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as
time from study entry until death, relapse, or failure to
achieve complete remission (CR) after receiving up to 2
courses of induction therapy, except for patients who enrolled on SWOG S9500 who received only one course of
induction. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was defined as time
from end of induction (EOI) for patients in CR, censoring patients who died without an intervening relapse.
Relapse risk (RR) was measured from end of induction for
patients in CR to relapse where deaths without a relapse
were considered competing events. Postremission
treatment-related mortality (TRM) was recorded from
EOI for patients in CR to death without a relapse, censoring relapses. AYAs lost to follow-up were censored at their
date of last known contact. Patients who received allogeneic BMTs were not censored in these analyses, with the
exception of the indicated RR and TRM, and some OS
and EFS analyses in which COG patients were censored
at the time of study transplant because few patients on the
adult trials received an allogeneic transplant and were
unidentified.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS
and EFS. Estimates include 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) using Greenwood’s estimate of the standard error.
Cumulative incidence of TRM and RR were estimated
using the method of Kalbfleisch and Prentice.21 The significance of predictor variables was tested with the logrank statistic for OS and EFS. Gray’s statistic was used to
compare cumulative incidence curves for RR and TRM.22
Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate
hazard ratios (HR) for cohorts of patients defined by age
and cooperative group and for analyzing age as a continuous variable for univariate and multivariate analyses of
OS, EFS, and RFS. The proportional hazards assumption
was tested for all covariates. Analyses of OS that compared

16- to 18-year-old patients versus 19- to 21-year-old
patients or patients from COG versus CALGB and
SWOG studies violated the proportional hazards assumption, and therefore a direct comparison between the 10year estimates of OS were summarized instead of the logrank statistic.

Remission Induction

The CR rate after receiving up to 2 courses of induction
was 79% for the entire cohort. These rates were significantly different among all 3 groups (COG, 82%;
CALGB, 76%; SWOG, 71%; P 5 .045), and there were
no differences in actuarial survival at 60 days (92%, 95%,
and 95%, respectively).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Overall Survival and Event-Free Survival

Patient characteristics are shown in Table 2. Overall, there
were 517 patients included in the analysis, with a median
age of 18 years, with the range in all 3 groups from 16 to
21 years. However, the COG cohort was significantly
younger with a median age of 17.2 years, P < .001, with
94% of the COG patients younger than 19 and only 1
patient at 21 years. The median ages of the CALGB (20.1
years) and SWOG (19.8 years) patients were comparable;
only 4 were 16 years old.
The median white blood cell count and blast percentage at diagnosis were 19.1 3 109/L and 73%, respectively, with no differences by cooperative group in these
or in the FAB classification distribution. Cytogenetic data
are reported in Table 3. There was an even distribution
across the 3 cooperative groups in the proportion of
patients in each risk group for all endpoints except for a
paucity of patients in the adverse risk group from SWOG.
Cytogenetic results were unknown on almost half the
patients. Molecular data were incomplete during the
study period, especially in the early years, and were not
analyzed.

Ten-year OS was higher for the COG cohort (Fig. 1A)
than for the 2 adult cohorts, 45% 6 6% versus 34% 6
7% with a 10-year estimate comparison of P 5 .026. The
adult trials had similar OS, 35% 6 8% for CALGB and
33% 6 12% for SWOG, P 5 1.00. Similarly, the 10-year
EFS was 38% 6 6% for the 281 AYAs on COG trials
compared to 23% 6 6% for the patients on the adult trials
(log-rank P 5 .006; Fig. 1B). Results from CALGB
and SWOG were comparable, at 24% 6 8% and
21% 6 10%, respectively; hence, for all other analyses,
the adult groups were combined for a single comparison
to COG. When we repeated the OS and EFS analyses censoring the COG transplant recipients (N 5 77), the overall results were similar. EFS for COG chemotherapy-only
patients was 36% 6 7%, P 5 .023 versus 23% on adult
trials; and OS 44% 6 7%, P 5 .053 versus 34% on adult
trials.
In examining age, OS at 10 years for the 16- to 18year-old patients was 43% 6 6% compared with
32% 6 8% for those aged 19 to 21 years (P 5 .034) when
comparing 10-year estimates (Fig. 1C). Figure 1D shows

those treated on adult trials, 57% 6 8% (Gray’s P < .001
for both comparisons). Younger patients on both the pediatric and adult trials had fewer relapses, at 34% 6 6%
versus 58% 6 10% for the older AYAs (Gray’s P < .001).
Both age groups treated on COG trials had much lower
relapse rates than patients on the adult trials regardless of
age (Fig. 2B).

Treatment-Related Mortality

Because of differences in the definition of TRM among
the cooperative groups during induction therapy, we analyzed TRM only from EOI. AYAs treated on the more
myelosuppressive COG protocols had a higher degree of
TRM (26% 6 6%) than those treated on the adult protocols (12% 6 6%, Gray’s P < .001). Censoring BMT
patients on COG trials only reduced the TRM to
22% 6 7%, still P < .001 compared to adult trials. Figure
2C shows the TRM stratified by both cooperative groups
and age (Gray’s P < .001 overall). Age played less of a
4176

role in TRM compared to the dramatic differences seen
in RR.
Role of Confounding Variables, Especially Age

Patient characteristics were examined as potential confounders to the superior outcomes of patients on pediatric
trials. Cox linear regression analyses were performed using
age as a continuous variable examining endpoints (Table
4). No significant differences were seen for OS. However,
increasing age was a significant risk factor for EFS and
RFS, despite a lower TRM associated with increasing age.
Looking at the adult and pediatric groups individually,
only EFS in the COG studies demonstrated poorer outcomes with increasing age (HR 5 1.16, P 5 .038). No
other patient characteristics examined were prognostic
except for adverse cytogenetics, which was highly significant (P < .001). There was a lower incidence of TRM for
patients with favorable cytogenetics on both pediatric and
adult trials (HR 5 0.53, P 5 .014).
Univariate and multivariate analyses were done for
EFS from study entry looking at age in 2 discrete cohorts

as above, and pediatric versus adult studies (Table 5).
Increased age and being on adult studies were risk factors
for outcome. However, in the multivariate analyses, neither age nor studies used showed a significant difference,
because there was such a strong correlation between age
and pediatric versus adult trials. Multivariate analysis of
OS was not appropriate due to nonproportional hazards.
Finally, we looked at just the 16- to 18-year-old cohort
comparing patients treated on either COG or CALGB/
SWOG trials. OS for those treated on the COG protocols
(N 5 263) was 44.9% 6 6.6% at 10 years versus
39.5% 6 11.6% for the 78 patients treated on the adult
trials (P 5 .417). There remained a significant reduction
in relapse risk for patients treated on the COG protocols,
whereas the TRM was significantly higher for the same
patients on COG trials.
Multivariate analyses were run to determine if the
period of study (early, 1986-1995; late, 1996-2008) or cytogenetics played any confounding role. Only adverse cytogenetics was confounding in the limited subset of
patients having known cytogenetics. After adjusting for
cytogenetics in multivariate models, 19- to 21-year-olds
(HR 5 1.24, 95% CI 5 0.92-1.68, P 5 .165) and
patients on adult studies (HR 5 1.32, 95% CI 5 0.991.77, P 5 .062) had nonsignificantly worse EFS.

Effect of Trial Era on Outcome

Finally, we compared the outcomes of studies before
1996 to studies from 1996 forward. OS at 10 years
increased from 34% 6 6% to 48% 6 6% (P 5 .045); and
EFS from 26% 6 6% to 33% 6 8% (P 5 .039) in later
studies. Unfortunately, TRM doubled from 12% 6 5%
to 26% 6 6% (Gray’s P < .001), but the relapse rate

DISCUSSION
There has been increasing attention given to the outcome
of AYAs with cancer. In the United States, lesser improvements in survival have been found in younger adults compared to either children or older adults. This fact may be
driven in part by a much lower participation rate in clinical trials, as noted for some cancers.23 However, treatment
effects probably play the largest role. As noted, AYA
patients with ALL will do substantially better if treated on
pediatric protocols.1,2 Patients in this age group with
common pediatric tumors such as rhabdomyosarcoma24
and Ewing’s sarcoma25 also seem to fare better when
treated on pediatric protocols. However, for cancers common in both age groups, eg, Hodgkin lymphoma, results
are comparable.26 AYAs with adult-type cancers may
actually fare better in the hands of adult oncologists.27
Small preliminary studies in de novo AML were
inconclusive regarding the optimum approach of treating
AYAs on childhood or adult protocols.4,5 Age was found
to be an important prognostic factor in patients aged 0 to
55 years treated on a common UK Medical Research
Council protocol.28 When pediatric-like therapy was
administered to adult patients younger than 50 years,
increased death from toxicity counterbalanced an
improvement in leukemia-free survival.29
We investigated AML outcomes of 517 AYAs from
3 large cooperative groups (COG, CALGB, and SWOG)
making this the largest attempt at comparing pediatric
and adult therapy. We took into account all potential
4177

measurable variables that could skew results. With the
exception of age, none of the other characteristics seemed
to play a role in the results obtained. In the limited subset
of patients with adequate cytogenetics, multivariate analyses revealed that adverse karyotypes were an important
prognostic factor, but hazard ratios for older age (1.24)
and adult studies (1.32) remained high, albeit with limited power. The OS and EFS were superior for patients
treated on COG protocols, but significantly more patients
on the adult trials were older, and those patients did worse
than younger adolescents regardless of protocol. Even in
this small age range of 6 years, the influence of increasing
age on lowering survival rates was noteworthy. We found
this fact most surprising, but appeared to be from both
higher relapse rates and higher TRM among the 19 to 21
year olds. Our best explanation is that this 6-year period is
a microcosm of overall results in AML between children
and older adults.
However, we noted striking differences between
causes for mortality. The more myelosuppressive pediatric
protocols had more anti-leukemia efficacy than the adult
trials, with halving of relapse rates; but the marked toxicity
that ensued was also clearly apparent with TRM of 26%
compared to 12% for the adult trials (P < .001).
Aggressive pediatric AML protocols are better tolerated in young children, with better survival than adults
enrolled on trials designed for middle-aged adults, which
must modify therapy for tolerability. Pediatric trials
would be superior for AYAs if the TRM with current therapy could be lowered. Molecular markers and inhibitors
are allowing treatment to be further stratified, sometimes
with greatly improved outcome without major myelosuppression.30 But for the vast majority of patients with
AML, it is not yet feasible to reduce profoundly myelosuppressive therapy and obtain optimal cure rates. In one
of the pediatric trials cited herein, CCG-2961, a dramatic
improvement in overall TRM resulted when an amendment requiring specific mandatory supportive care measures was implemented.9 Furthermore, the improvement
in TRM specifically among the AYAs on CCG-2961 was
even more dramatic, 43% for preamendment versus 22%
postamendment (P 5 .03).31 Overall OS improved from
43% to 57%, and the results also documented a “learning
curve,” reflected by a lowering of TRM with time, even
before the supportive care amendment was implemented.
This has been noted in adult trials,32 where traditionally
supportive care is left to institutional guidelines, with
results generalizable to community/standard practice. It is
recommended that adult AML patients be cared for by
physicians who are experienced in treating leukemia. The
4178

pediatric protocols have in general been more specific in
outlining such guidelines.
Until more highly effective molecular inhibitors of
specific AML subtypes are discovered, pediatric and adult
oncologists taking care of these patients should focus their
attention on supportive care measures to lower TRM. Perhaps an intergroup trial of AML in 16- to 30-year-olds
could be implemented to better understand age-related
differences in outcome, laying the groundwork for future
AYA trials.
