ABSTRACT
We previously reported that dietary methylselenocysteine (MSC) inhibits
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU)-induced mammary tumorigenesis by resetting
circadian gene expression disrupted by the carcinogen at the early stage of
tumorigenesis. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we developed a circadian
reporter system comprised of human mammary epithelial cells with a luciferase
reporter driven by the promoter of human PERIOD 2 (PER2), a core circadian gene.
In this in vitro model, NMU disrupted cellular circadian rhythm in a pattern similar to
that observed with SIRT1-specific inhibitors; in contrast, MSC restored the circadian
rhythms disrupted by NMU and protected against SIRT1 inhibitors. Moreover, NMU
inhibited intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio and reduced NAD+-dependent SIRT1 activity
in a dose-dependent manner, while MSC restored NAD+/NADH and SIRT1 activity in
the NMU-treated cells, indicating that the NAD+-SIRT1 pathway was targeted by NMU
and MSC. In rat mammary tissue, a carcinogenic dose of NMU also disrupted NAD+/
NADH oscillations and decreased SIRT1 activity; dietary MSC restored NAD+/NADH
oscillations and increased SIRT1 activity in the mammary glands of NMU-treated rats.
MSC-induced SIRT1 activity was correlated with decreased acetylation of BMAL1 and
increased acetylation of histone 3 lysine 9 at the Per2 promoter E-Box in mammary
tissue. Changes in SIRT1 activity were temporally correlated with loss or restoration
of rhythmic Per2 mRNA expression in NMU-treated or MSC-rescued rat mammary
glands, respectively. Together with our previous findings, these results suggest that
enhancement of NAD+-dependent SIRT1 activity contributes to the chemopreventive
efficacy of MSC by restoring epigenetic regulation of circadian gene expression at
early stages of mammary tumorigenesis.

cells, the periodicity of circadian clock is regulated by
interconnected transcriptional/translational feedback
loops. Heterodimers of circadian transcription factors,
BMAL1 (Brain-Muscle Arnt-Like protein 1) and either
CLOCK or NPAS2, regulate transcription by binding
to E-box elements in the promoters of core circadian

INTRODUCTION
The circadian clock regulates a wide range of
cellular and physiological processes in a precise and
sustained rhythm with a periodicity of ~24 hrs. The clock
comprises molecular oscillators functioning in both the

genes (CGs) [e.g., Period (Per) gene], and numerous
circadian-controlled genes (CCGs) (e.g., hormone
receptors, growth associated genes and DNA damage
response and repair genes) [1]. As circadian proteins
accumulate in the cell, they are post-translationally
modified and transported to the nucleus to repress or
activate Clock:Bmal1 transcriptional activity. In this
way, core circadian genes limit their own transcription
and set up the rhythmic expression of CGs and CCGs
[2]. These intrinsic molecular oscillators can be reset by
external signals including light, genotoxic stress, nutrients,
hormones, and environmental signals [1–4]. Thus,
circadian clocks integrate a wide variety of environmental
and cellular inputs to maintain normal cellular and
physiological homeostasis under changing conditions.
One of the important functions of circadian clock is
to regulate the organism’s response to genotoxic stress (e.g.,
carcinogen exposure). The circadian clock regulates the
transcription, translation, and post-translational modification
of ~10% genes involved in DNA damage response and
repair and cell-cycle progression [5]. Circadian rhythm
also can be reset or disrupted by genotoxic agents,
increasing the susceptibility of cells to DNA damage and
carcinogenesis [6–8]. As a result, disruption of circadian
rhythm by lifestyle, occupational, and genetic factors has
been associated with an increased risk of various types of
cancers, including breast cancer [9, 10].
The promoting effect of circadian disruption on
carcinogenesis is consistent with the finding that Per2 has
tumor suppressing activity [2]. Knocking out or mutating
Per2 increases cancer cell growth, and accelerates
spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumor development
in rodents. By contrast, normal or ectopic expression of
clock genes induces cell cycle arrest and sensitizes cancer
cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis after exposure to
genotoxic stress. Decreased expression of circadian genes
is observed in various human cancers, including breast
cancer, and genetic variants, mutations, and epigenetic
modifications of CGs are associated with invasive and
aggressive breast cancer [2, 11, 12]. In addition, Per2
links the circadian cycle to estrogen receptor signaling
[13, 14]. These findings indicate that maintenance of
normal rhythmic expression of CGs (e.g., Per2) plays an
important role in suppression of mammary tumorigenesis.
Restoration of normal circadian rhythm has been
linked to chemopreventive activity of dietary organic
selenium (Se) in our recent studies [13, 15]. Selenium
is a trace element essential to numerous biological
processes, including antioxidant defense systems, thyroid
hormone metabolism, and immune function [16]. Both
epidemiology and animal studies have revealed that
selenium compounds have chemopreventive activity
against various cancers, including breast cancer. In
particular, L-methyl-selenocysteine (MSC) and its
metabolites showed the greatest inhibitory effect on
mammary and prostate tumorigenesis, especially during
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

early stages, in rodent models [16, 17]. Furthermore,
MSC also improves therapeutic efficacy and ameliorates
systemic toxicity of anticancer drugs in various animal
models [18, 19]. Multiple mechanisms have been
proposed to explain selenium-mediated chemoprevention;
however, many unsuccessful clinical trials indicated that
more mechanistic studies are needed for development
of effective intervention strategies [20]. Recent in vitro
studies showed that selenium compounds protect against
peroxynitrite-induced DNA damage through glutathionemediated redox cycling [21]. MSC induces cell senescence
through activation of the ATM-mediated DNA repair
upon exposure to genotoxic and oxidative stresses [22].
The latter effects are supported by clinical intervention
studies showing that selenium supplementation reduced
oxidative DNA damage and cancer incidence in carriers
of BRCA1 mutations [23]. Moreover, selenium modulates
multiple transcription factors activities involved in cellular
responses to stress, including NFĸB [24], p53 [25], and
BMAL1 [18]. Selenium compounds also up-regulate
tumor suppressor gene expression by inhibiting the
activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs) [26] and DNA
methyltransferases [27].
Our previous studies demonstrated that in vivo
exposure to carcinogen disrupts the circadian clock
of target tissues. Our studies were the first to link
chemopreventive efficacy of organic selenium to
restoration of circadian clock in carcinogen-exposed
rats [13, 15]. Exposure to a single carcinogenic dose of
N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) resulted in an apparent
disruption in the rhythmic expression of CGs and CCGs in
the mammary glands of female Fisher rats at day 30 postexposure. Dietary MSC, given at chemopreventive dose
for 30 days beginning after carcinogen exposure, reduced
the incidence of mammary adenocarcinoma by ~60%
[15, 28]. MSC also reset and enhanced the rhythmic
expression of CGs, especially Per2, and CCGs, including
several growth-regulatory genes and DNA damage
responsive and repair genes [13, 15]. In the present study,
we investigated the mechanisms by which MSC is able
to reset and to enhance CG expression disrupted by the
carcinogen. The protracted time course and reversibility of
NMU-initiated effects by MSC suggested that both NMU
and MSC might alter epigenetic regulation of circadian
gene expression [29]. Consistent with this possibility,
previous studies implicated phosphorylation of histone
3 (H3) at serine 10 as a regulator of circadian gene
expression [30]. Further studies documented rhythmic
acetylation of H3 on circadian gene promoters, with a
peak acetylation corresponding with peak transcription
[31]. The discovery that the circadian transcription factor,
CLOCK, has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity
further implicated chromatin remodeling in regulation of
CGs and CCGs [32]. The NAD+-dependent deacetylase,
Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) counterbalances CLOCK-directed
acetylation of its hetero-dimerization partner, BMAL1 at

lysine 537, and histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) [33]. Genetic
ablation or pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 activity
disturbs circadian acetylation of H3 and BMAL1 [33].
Given that the SIRT1 activity is regulated by intracellular
NAD+/NADH, we investigated the effects of NMU and
MSC on the NAD+-SIRT1 pathway and their impact on
mammary circadian clock using both in vitro and in vivo
models.

respectively.

MSC counteracts NMU to restore SIRT1 activity
and NAD+/NADH ratio in mammary epithelial
cells in vitro
In order to test our hypothesis that NMU and
MSC modulate the mammary circadian clock by altering
NAD+-SIRT1 pathway in mammary epithelial cells,
we further determined the SIRT1 activity in the human
mammary epithelial cells after treatment with MSC for
72 hours following exposure to NMU for 1 hour. Our
results indicated that NMU induced a dose-dependent
decrease in SIRT1 activity, while addition of MSC at
the concentration (12.5 μM) that can restore the cellular
circadian rhythm disrupted by NMU or SIRT1 inhibitors,
significantly increased SIRT1 activity in the cells treated
with 0.5 mM NMU, without a significant effect on the
untreated control cells (Fig. 2A). These results suggested
that the inhibitory effect of NMU on SIRT1 activity may
be at least partially responsible for the disappearance of
the second peak of cellular circadian rhythm in the reporter
cells, while induction of SIRT1 activity by MSC rescued
the second cycle of rhythm disrupted by NMU (Fig. 1).
These findings demonstrate that NMU and MSC alter
cellular circadian rhythm by modulating SIRT1 activity.
However, increasing doses of either NMU (0–1 mM)
or MSC (0–25  μM) showed no significant effect on
purified recombinant SIRT1 enzyme activity ex vivo (data
not shown), indicating that neither compound directly
modulates SIRT1 protein deaceylase activity.
We further observed that the intracellular
NAD+/NADH ratio was decreased as a function of
increasing dose (0–0.5 mM) of NMU. MSC significantly
increased NAD+/NADH in a dose-dependent manner in
the cells pretreated with NMU, but not in untreated control
cells (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that NMU and MSC
modulate SIRT1 activity by changing NAD+/NADH in
mammary epithelial cells.

RESULTS
MSC restored cellular circadian rhythms
disrupted by NMU and SIRT1 inhibitors in
mammary epithelial cells in vitro
We previously reported that dietary MSC inhibits
NMU-induced mammary tumorigenesis by resetting
circadian gene expression disrupted by the carcinogen
at early stages of tumorigenesis. To investigate the
underlying mechanisms, we developed a circadian
reporter system comprising human mammary epithelial
cells with a destabilized firefly luciferase reporter driven
by the promoter of human PER2. The PER2 promoter was
selected as a surrogate for circadian gene expression in
our in vitro system, because it has been demonstrated in
our previous in vivo studies to be the major clock gene
linking the circadian rhythm and chemoprevention and
it is known to be directly regulated by the circadian
transcription factor, BMAL1:CLOCK. Using this reporter
system, we were able to monitor the cellular circadian
rhythm of gene expression in vitro for couple of days after
synchronization.
Untreated, transiently transfected cells (control
group) showed two complete cycles of luminescence
signaling after synchronization (Fig. 1A). Treatment with
0.25 mM NMU did not disrupt the cellular circadian
rhythm. Exposure to 0.5 mM NMU initially delayed
and later abolished circadian rhythm, as indicated by
disappearance of the second peak of luminescence at
~50 hours post-treatment. Inhibition of SIRT1 activity with
20 nM Ex257 (SIRT1 specific inhibitor) or 1 μM cambinol
(SIRT1 and SIRT2 dual inhibitor) similarly disrupted
circadian rhythm by dampening the subsequent circadian
cycle (Fig. 1A①). Importantly, addition of MSC (12.5 μM)
into culture medium restored circadian rhythm in NMUtreated cells towards the normal in both first and second
cycles. MSC not only restored the rhythm disrupted by
NMU but also prevented the disruptive effects of SIRT1
inhibitors, Ex257 and cambinol (Fig. 1A②).
In stably transfected cell lines, both NMU and SIRT1
inhibitors disrupted circadian rhythm, albeit at higher
concentrations than that observed in transient transfectants
(Fig. 1B①). MSC (12.5 μM) restored circadian rhythms in
the cells pretreated with 1 mM NMU (Fig. 1B②). More
importantly, MSC also restored circadian rhythms in the
cells treated with SIRT1 inhibitors, including EX257

MSC restored the NMU-disrupted circadian
expression of Per2 mRNA in rat mammary
glands in vivo
To test whether the effects of NMU and MSC on
cellular circadian rhythm in vitro can also be observed
in vivo, we examined the rhythmic expression of Per2 in
mammary glands of pubertal female rats at day 2 or 30
following exposed to NMU and maintained on MSCenriched diet or control diet. An apparent circadian
rhythm of Per2 mRNA expression was observed in
mammary glands of control rats. Exposure to a single
carcinogenic dose of NMU induced a gradual and
persistent, time-dependent decrease in the rhythmic
expression of Per2 mRNA in mammary glands of rats.

The slight disruptive effect of NMU on the rhythmic

after exposure, and it progressed to complete disruption by
day 30 (Fig. 3A). A dietary supplement of MSC given for
30-days after NMU not only prevented and/or reversed the
disruptive effects of NMU on circadian rhythm, but also
significantly enhanced the rhythmic expression of Per2

and reproduced our previous observation in vivo [13].

the in vivo studies were consistent with the findings in our
in vitro studies. These results connect the effect of MSC
on NAD+-dependent SIRT1 activity in the present study
to its previously reported chemopreventive activity via the
restoration of circadian expression of Per2 [13].

To further investigate the mechanisms by which
the NMU- and MSC-induced alterations in SIRT1
activity modulate circadian gene expression, we used a
Chromatin Immunoprecepitation (ChIP) assay to evaluate
their effects on acetylation of BMAL1 and histones
at E-box and Exon 1 within the Per2 promoter in vivo
(Fig. 5A). The analysis showed that AcBMAL1 bound
preferentially to the E-box relative to Exon 1 in Per2
promoter, indicating that circadian transcription of Per2
is associated with AcBMAL1 at Per2 promoter E-Box
in mammary glands, as reported for other organs [32]. In
controls, AcBMAL1 binding to the Per2 promoter was
higher during the day (ZT0-12) than at night (ZT16-20),
with the Per2 expression peaking at ZT16 (Fig. 5B &
Fig. 3). At day 30 post-exposure to NMU, we observed
that binding of AcBMAL1 was delayed by 4–8 hours, with
peak binding at ZT12. Importantly, MSC advanced the
phase of AcBMAL1 binding by 4–8 hours to match that

Next, we examined if the effects of NMU and
MSC on NAD+/NADH and SIRT1 activity that we
observed in vitro also happened in rat mammary tissue
in vivo during mammary tumorigenesis. NAD+/NADH
in mammary glands of control rats showed a normal
circadian pattern over a 24-hour period, with a peak at
ZT4–8. At day 30 after exposure to NMU, the circadian
oscillation in the NAD+/NADH was ablated as compared
to the control. However, dietary MSC restored both the
rhythm and the levels of NAD+/NADH to those seen in
control rats, and reset the circadian phase, with the peak
at ZT8 (Fig. 4A). Consistent with decreased levels of
NAD+/NADH, mammary glands of NMU-treated rats
showed decreased SIRT1 activity as compared to control
rats. By contrast, SIRT1 activity was significantly higher

comparison, NMU-treated rats maintained on MSC-enriched
diet showed diurnal changes in AcH3K9 at both Exon1 and
E-box sites, with peak values at ZT 8-12 (Fig. 5C & Fig. 3).
These results suggest that circadian pattern of AcH3K9 at
the E-box is temporally correlated with the rhythm, while
AcH3K9 at Exon1 is correlated with the change of level in
Per2 mRNA expression (Fig. 5C & Fig. 3). While NMU

observations indicated that MSC counteracts the effect
of NMU on AcBMAL1 at E-box to induce Per2 mRNA
expression in vivo (Fig. 5B & Fig. 3).
Since acetylation status of histones was shown to
be associated with the circadian transcription of Per2
and the acetylation process is also under circadian control
[32], we next examined acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 9
(AcH3K9) on the E-box and Exon1 of the Per2 promoter
after exposure to NMU and MSC. ChIP assay results
showed that in controls, the peak of highest AcH3K9
level at E-box occurred at ZT12, four hours prior to
the peak in Per2 mRNA; peak AcH3K9 level at Exon1
occurred at ZT16, corresponding to the peak Per2 mRNA
transcription. In NMU-treated rats on control diet, there
was no detectable AcH3K9 at the E-box and no rhythmic
expression of Per2 mRNA expression; AcH3K9 was
detectable at Exon1 although the change in level did not

DISCUSSION
Both epidemiology and animal studies have
indicated that selenium reduces the incidence of various
cancers, stimulating several large-scale intervention trials
42885

using various organic selenium compounds [16, 34].
Unfortunately, none of these interventions showed
protective effects of selenium compounds, highlighting
the need for defining and matching the mechanistic
underpinnings with compounds that target patients with
specific exposures and/or risk factors. The present study
investigated the mechanism by which MSC restores
circadian gene expression, with the goal of using
mechanistic insights to develop intervention strategies to
reduce the risk of breast cancer associated with exposures
that disturb circadian rhythm.
A wide array of metabolic and physiological
processes display daily oscillations [35, 36], and an
interplay exists between circadian clocks and metabolic
rhythms in all organisms [37]. Metabolic rhythms connect
the circadian clock via cycles of epigenetic modification.
Two of these, the NAD+ and acetylation cycles, affect the
amplitude of circadian gene expression [32]. Correlation
between DNA damage-associated NAD+ depletion and
decrease of SIRT1 activity in older rats suggested that
NAD+ is important for cancer prevention and longevity
[38]. The repair of single-strand DNA breaks by base
excision is facilitated by poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP), which uses NAD+ as a substrate. Since NAD+ also
serves as an important redox carrier to power oxidative
phosphorylation and ATP production, prolonged activation
of PARP depletes NAD+ and causes cell death [39].
We hypothesize that exposure to DNA-damaging
agents depletes intracellular NAD+ and decreases SIRT1
activity, attenuating circadian rhythm, reducing the
ATM/CHEK2-mediated DNA repair, which in turn
activates PARP to further deplete NAD+. NMU is a potent
alkylating agent. Base excision repair is the principal
mechanism by which mammalian cells repair alkylated
DNA. Depleting of cellular NAD+ is therefore a plausible
mechanism by which NMU could ablate epigenetic
regulation of circadian genes. Excision repair–induced
depletion of NAD+ could decrease SIRT1 activity, leading
to increased AcBMAL1 at the corresponding time point
and repressed circadian expression of Per2 and CCGs,
including DNA repair genes and tumor suppressor genes
[13]. This hypothesis is supported by our observation
from both in vitro and in vivo assays. Mammary cell
death and inflammation after NMU exposure could also
contribute to the disruption of circadian rhythm in vivo at
the early time point [40], but are unlikely to precipitate the
observed progressive and persistent circadian disruption
over 30 days.
Selenium compounds protect cells against
peroxynitrite-induced DNA damage through glutathionemediated redox cycling and enhance cellular defenses
against oxidative DNA damage [21]. Accordingly,
selenium supplementation decreased oxidative DNA
damage and reduced breast cancer risk in recent
intervention trials [23]. The selenium-modulated cycling
of GSH/GSSG is coupled to NADP+/NADPH and NAD+/
NADH, suggesting that selenium affects levels of NAD+
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metabolites through its antioxidant properties [21]. We
found that MSC regulates redox cycling (NAD+/NADH),
increasing NAD+-dependent SIRT1 activity and expression
of the major CGs, Per2. Since the expression of ~10%
of genes involved in DNA repair and cell proliferation
is controlled by circadian rhythm [2], MSC-induced
circadian expression might enhance ATM/CHEK2mediated DNA repair to reduce DNA damage and prevent
NAD+ depletion. Selenium compounds have also been
shown to activate ATM-mediated repair in response to
genotoxic and oxidative stresses, which could contribute
to prevent NAD+ depletion and reset circadian rhythm,
enhancing barriers to tumorigenisis [22].
Further mechanistic studies indicated that the MSCinduced increase of SIRT1 activity correlated temporally
with decreased AcBMAL1 at the E-box element of
Per2 promoter. These changes correlated with enhanced
circadian Per2 transcription, supporting the contention
that SIRT1 is required for circadian transcription of
major CGs (e.g., Per2). These findings are consistent
with previous studies showing that SIRT1 uses NAD+
to remove acetyl groups from BMAL1, decreasing
AcBMAL1 and leading to enhanced CLOCK/BMAL1
binding to E-boxes, acetylation of H3 and transcription of
Per2 [33, 41]. Alternatively, enhanced deacetylation and
degradation of PER2 protein by increased SIRT1 activity
could also be a mechanism underlying the restoration of
rhythmic Per2 mRNA expression [42]. Additional studies
will be required to fully understand the mechanism by
which the reduced (or enhanced) NAD+-SIRT1 activity
caused disruption (or restoration) of rhythmic expression
of Per2 mRNA in mammary epithelial cells.
Significantly, we observed similar results in
mammary cells both in vitro and in vivo. By contrast,
in vitro studies in mouse embryo fibroblasts indicated
that SIRT1 inhibitors actually enhanced the rhythmic
expression of the Dbp gene during the circadian first
cycle post serum shock [33]. We detected a similar
effect when mammary epithelial cells were treated with
NMU or SIRT1 inhibitors in vitro. These observations
suggest that the initial response to agents that perturb
circadian regulation may be induction of compensatory
mechanisms. However, our in vitro results indicated
that despite this initial adaptive response, cells treated
with NMU or SIRT1 inhibitors immediately showed
dampening of subsequent circadian cycles. The inability
to reestablish a second cycle suggests that imbalance
in the circadian clock machinery compromises
amplitude control and/or the cells were unable to
sustain the initial compensatory response [43]. In the
case of genotoxicants, this could be due to depletion of
intracellular NAD+ by DNA repair processes. Increase
of NAD+/NADH by MSC could prevent depletion
of intracellular NAD+, allowing the circadian gene
expression to persist in subsequent cycles. Nonetheless,
further investigations are needed to address these
differences.

It is important to note that the regulation of circadian
gene expression can vary significantly among cell types,
species and even strains of mice [44, 45]. Of particular
note is that regulation of circadian gene expression is
independent of melatonin in many mouse strains [45].
The absence of the melatonin-mediated circadian control
leads to a compensatory substitution of energy balance/
food intake as a mediator of circadian regulation [46]. As
a result, the primary circadian regulatory mechanisms and
responses to stressors may show commensurate variations.
In our studies, MSC-induced SIRT1 activity
was correlated with restoration and enhancement of
circadian histone acetylation (AcH3K9). These findings
are consistent with previous studies showing that
inhibition of SIRT1 activity in vitro abolished rhythm
of AcK3K9 at the E-box motif of the circadian outcome
gene, Dbp [33]. In addition, the rhythmic AcH3K9 not
only regulates the rhythmic mRNA expression of Per2
gene, but is also controlled by the circadian clock [31].
The enhanced AcH3K9 rhythm might thus be regulated
by increased circadian rhythm that was modulated by
decreased-AcBMAL1 resulting from increased NAD+dependent SIRT1 activity by MSC. Alternatively, the
inhibitory effect of MSC on other histone deacetylases
could also contribute to the increased level of AcH3K9
in vivo [26]. These results suggest that enhancement of
NAD+-dependent SIRT1 activity by MSC can restore

circadian gene expression following carcinogen exposure.
The resulting increase in molecular circadian oscillation
may resynchronize the AcH3K9 cycling in the promoters
of CGs and CCGs to further amplify the rhythmic gene
expression (Fig. 6). Regardless of a precise molecular
mechanism, our observation on the ability of selenium to
modulate circadian transcriptional activity is supported
by a previous report indicating that selenium modulates
the circadian clock to protect mice from the toxicity of a
chemotherapeutic drug [18].
Together with our previous findings in
chemoprevention studies [13, 15], these results indicate
that MSC enhances NAD+/NADH oscillation and SIRT1
activity to increase circadian expression of genes involved
in DNA repair and tumor suppression, contributing to
early barrier to tumorigenesis. Although the role of SIRT1
gene in carcinogenesis remains controversial [47], studies
in various in vitro studies and in vivo models have found
a significant association between the increases in NAD+
level and SIRT1 activity by fasting, exercise, and other
chemopreventive regimens and the prevention of agingrelated diseases, including cancer and metabolic syndrome
[48–50]. Increased SIRT1 activity may prevent the early
stage pathogenesis by restoring or enhancing circadian
rhythms. These findings suggest that the ability of various
SIRT1 activating compounds, including plant polyphenols,
niacin vitamins, and nicotinamide riboside, to prevent

Figure 6: Mechanistic diagram of NAD+/NADH and SIRT1 in regulation of circadian rhythm by MSC. Enhancement
of NAD+-dependent SIRT1 activity by MSC restores circadian rhythm via restoring epigenetic regulation of Per2 expression, which may
contribute to chemopreventive activity of MSC at the early stage of tumorigenesis.

stress-related disease processes may be partially mediated
through their effects on circadian rhythm [51]. The
ability of dietary MSC to modulate circadian rhythm by
enhancing SIRT1 activity may have therefore significant
implication in chemoprevention of cancer and other agingrelated chronic diseases. Testing of a large panel of cell
lines and animal models would be needed to determine
how universal the restoration effect of dietary MSC on
circadian rhythm disrupted by environmental factors
is. Further studies are warranted to assess whether the
chemopreventive potential of MSC can be enhanced when
used in combination with other agents that prevent NAD+
depletion and activate SIRT1 activity during the early
stage of tumorigenesis.

NMU, 20 nM EX527 (a SIRT1-specific inhibitor, Sigma),
or 1 μM cambinol (inhibit both SIRT1 and SIRT2, Sigma)
for 1 hour in MEBM. After washing with PBS, recording
medium [MEBM supplemented with 20% of normal
concentrations of growth supplements, 6.5 mM sodium
bicarbonate, 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.2), 0.1 mM
Luciferin (Promega), and 50 units/ml penicillin and
50 μg/ml streptomycin] containing 12.5 μM MSC alone,
or in combination with 20 nM EX527 or 1 μM cambinol
was added. Plates were sealed with a sterile glass cover
slide using silicon grease and subjected to continuous
monitoring by an LumiCycle 32TM (Actimetric). Stably
transfected MCF10A/PER2-dLuc cells selected with
1000  μg/ml of G418 (Gibco) were treated with NMU
at 0.5, 1, or 2 mM, EX527 at 40 nM, or Cambinol at
2.0 μM for 1 hour after synchronization with 50% HS,
and then the cells were incubated in recording medium
containing 12.5 μM of MSC and monitored by LumiCycle
for 4–5 days. By using LumiCycle Analysis Software
(Actimerics), the data were detrended (running average)
and then best-fits to a sine wave were estimated by a
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for measurement of
period, phase, amplitude, and damping rate as reported
previously [52]. All treatment concentrations used were
lower than LC30 after incubation for the time indicated.
All experiments were conducted three times and the
representative results were presented.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and treatment
Immortalized, non-tumorigenic human mammary
epithelial cell line (MCF10A) was purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), where cells
were cytogenetically tested and authenticated with short
tandem repeat analysis before freezing. Each vial of
frozen cells was thawed and maintained in culture for a
maximum of 8 weeks. Cells were cultured in mammary
epithelial cell growth medium (MEGM) (Lonza),
containing mammary epithelial basal medium (MEBM)
and growth supplements provided in SigleQuots Kit
(Lonza) (including 0.4% bovine pituitary extract, 0.1%
insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone, 0.1% human epidermal
growth factors, and 0.05% gentamycin sulfate and 0.05%
amphotericin-B). Cholera toxin (Sigma) was also added to
MEGM at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Cells were
incubated at 37°C, 95% humidity and 5% CO2.
For NAD+/NADH and SIRT1 activity assays, cells
were treated with NMU (0.25 or 0.50 mM) or vehicle
control (0.1% DMSO) for 1 hour at 37°C. After washing
with 1XPBS, cells were treated with MSC (6.3 or
12.5 μM) or vehicle control (0.1% ethanol) for 72 hours.

Animal treatment and sample collection
Experiments were performed in AAALAC accredited
facilities at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey
using protocols approved by our Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. Female Fisher (F344) rats (Harlan
Laboratories) were acclimatized to a powdered ration
(Tekland). Rats were maintained on the powdered diet (i.e.,
standard AIN-76A diet containing 0.01 ppm selenium as
sodium selenite) for one week. The MSC-enriched diet
was produced by admixing L-Se-methylselenocysteine
(Selenium Technologies) with the control diet to a
concentration of 3 ppm selenium. Animals were housed
under controlled conditions with a 12 hour light/12 hour
dark cycle. Zeitgeber Time 0 (ZT 0) was set at 7 AM
(light on); ZT12 was set at 7 PM (light off).
NMU (Sigma) was dissolved in acidified saline
(pH 5) to a concentration of 10 mg/ml immediately before
injection. For time course studies, 63 female F344 rats
(aged 55 ± 2 days, 155–175 g) treated with NMU by a
single intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection (50 mg/kg body
weight), were randomized to 3 groups (21 rats per group).
Groups 1, 2, and 3 were sacrificed at days 0, 2, and
30 post-exposure, respectively. For mechanistic studies,
42 NMU-treated rats were randomized into two groups
of 21 animals and maintained on control diet or MSCenriched diet for 30 days. Twenty-one vehicle controls
maintained on standardized diet served as the control
group. Three rats per group were sacrificed by CO2

Cellular circadian rhythm assay
A fragment (947 bp) of the promoter region of
human PER2 (hPER2P) containing 3 of BMAL1 binding
motifs (CAC/TGTG) was obtained from a plasmid,
pLS[hPER2P/rLuc/Puro] (LightSwitch Genomics).
hPER2P was subcloned into destabilized firefly luciferase
(dLuc) vector with neomycin selection gene [pGL(Luc2P/
Neo)] (Promega), producing a pGL[hPER2P(Luc2P/Neo)]
construct. MCF10A cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes at
2 × 105 cells per dish and transfected with 1 μg of vector
using FuGene HDTM transfection reagent (LightSwitch
Genomics). After 48 hours post-transfection, cells were
starved from growth factors in MEBM for 24 hours. After
synchronization with 50% horse serum (HS) (Invitrogen)
for 2 hours, cells were treated with 0.25 mM or 0.5 mM

asphyxiation every 4 hours over a 24-hour period,
beginning at 7 AM (ZT0). All mammary glands at each
side of individual rats were carefully dissected, combined
into a pool of left or right mammary gland tissue sample.
Tissue samples were snap-frozen on dry ice, and then
stored at −80°C.

Pooled frozen right-side mammary tissue samples
from three rats (100 mg mammary gland per rat) per group
at each time point were used for ChIP assay. Frozen tissues
were pulverized and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde,
followed by quenching with 125 mM glycine. Cell pellets
were homogenized with cold cell lysis buffer containing
protease inhibitor cocktails I & II (Sigma) and processed
using EZ-ChIPTM kits (Millipore). Briefly, nuclear and
membrane pellets were lysed and sonicated to chromatin
fragments of ~200–1000 base pairs. Cross-linked chromatin
was pre-cleared and incubated with anti-acetylated
BMAL1 (AcBMAL1) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech) or
anti- acetylated H3K9 (AcH3K9) antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotech) at 4°C overnight. Normal rabbit IgG served as
negative control and anti-RNA polymerase II as positive
control. After protein-DNA cross-links were reversed;
resolved, purified DNA was used for PCR. PCR was
performed with primers targeting the E-box (CACGTG)
(sense, 5′-AGCTGGGCTATAGAGGTGCTGA-3′; antisense, 5′-CACCGTCTCTGTGGCACGT-3′) or Exon1
region (sense, 5′- AATCAGCTTTCCAAACTGGTTCC-3′;
anti-sense,
5′-TGGAGCAGTCACGTCATCCTT-3′)
in the Per2 promoter. PCR conditions were as follows:
1 cycle at 95°C for 1.5 min, 35 cycles of inactivation at
95°C for 45s, annealing at 60°C for 60s, and extension at
72°C for 60s, and 1 final cycle for extension at 72°C for
5 min. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis and
photographed.

NAD+/NADH quantification
Assays were performed with frozen rat mammary
gland samples or cultured cells. Frozen right-side mammary
gland samples (~50 mg) from 3 rats per group per time were
used for NAD+/NADH assay. Tissue samples or cell pellets
were homogenized, extracted, and filtered using 10 Kd spin
column (BioVison) to remove enzymes that rapidly consume
NADH. NAD+/NADH ratios were determined using NAD+/
NADH Quantification KitTM (BioVision) according to the
manufacturer instruction. The NAD+/NADH was calculated
with the formulation (NADt-NADH)/NADH, where NADt
is total of NADH and NAD+. Three independent samples
per group per time were analyzed in triplicate.

SIRT1 activity assay
Total protein extracts were prepared from a small
piece (~50 mg) of tissue from right-side mammary
gland of individual rats sacrificed at ZT12 on the day
30 post-exposure, or from cultured cells with RIPA
buffer. SIRT1 deacetylase activity was determined with
SIRT1 Fluorimetric Drug Discovery KitsTM (Enzo Life
Sciences). Briefly, initial deacetylation rates of SIRT1
were determined at 1 unit human recombinant SIRT1
enzyme, 25 μM deacetylase substrate, and 25 μM NAD+
(37°C) in the absence (control) or presence of 10 μl of
extracted protein. Fluorescence signal was measured with
a microplate reader at 360 nm excitation and 460 nm
emission wavelengths. Standard curve was produced
with serially diluted-deacetylation standard. Activity
was normalized to protein concentration and expressed
as deacetylated product (μmol)/ protein (μg). Three
independent samples per group were analyzed in triplicate.
To determine if NMU and MSC affected SIRT1
activity directly, we also performed SIRT1 activity assay
with different concentrations of NMU (0, 0.25, 0.5,
1 mM) or MSC (0, 6.3, 12.5, 25 μM) in the presence of
purified human recombinant SIRT1 enzyme but absence of
extracted tissue protein ex vivo.

Statistical analyses
Animal number N = 3 was used in vivo studies.
All experiments were performed in triplicate in in vitro
studies. Intergroup differences were evaluated using oneway ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. We
used alpha = 0.05 or 0.01 as the level of significance for
hypothesis testing.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from a small piece
(~50 mg) of frozen tissue from right-side mammary glands
of rats sacrificed on days 0, 2, and 30 post-exposure to
NMU with or without MSC-enriched diet. Per2 mRNA
expression levels were determined using real-time
quantitative RT-PCR as described previously [13].
