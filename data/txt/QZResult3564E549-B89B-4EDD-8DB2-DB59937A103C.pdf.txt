Abstract
The cell surface transmembrane receptor TM4SF5 has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
but its candidacy as a therapeutic target has not been evaluated. Building on ﬁndings that immunization with
a peptide vaccine targeting human TM4SF5 can exert prophylactic and therapeutic effects in a murine model
of HCC, we developed a monoclonal antibody to characterize expression of TM4SF5 in HCC and to target its
function there as an anticancer strategy. We found that the antibody modulated cell signaling in HCC cells
in vitro, reducing cell motility, modulating E-cadherin expression, altering p27kip1 localization, and increasing
RhoA activity. Using a mouse xenograft model of human HCC, we documented the in vivo efﬁcacy of the
antibody, which suppressed tumor growth in either tumor prevention or treatment designs. Our work offers a
preclinical proof of concept for TM4SF5 as a promising target for antibody therapeutics to treat HCC. Cancer

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers and the second or third most frequent cause
of cancer-related death worldwide (1, 2). HCC is also the
most common type of liver cancer and is usually associated
with prior hepatitis virus infection or liver cirrhosis. The
primary treatment for HCC is surgical resection; however,
the high frequency of recurrence and poor liver function
following the removal of liver tissue are signiﬁcant obstacles
to recovery (3). Furthermore, HCC is frequently resistant
to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy (4). Therefore, understanding the signaling pathways involved in
HCC development and developing targeted therapies is
likely to be an important strategy for the effective treatment
of HCC (3, 5).

Tetraspanins, also known as transmembrane 4 superfamily
(TM4SF) members, mediate signal transduction events that
regulate cell differentiation, activation, growth, and migration
(6, 7). For example, TM4SF4 regulates endocrine pancreas
differentiation and inhibits Rho family of GTPase-activated
cell migration and actin organization in a Rho kinase (ROCK)–
independent fashion (7). The diverse activities of tetraspanins
seem to be related to their capacity to associate with various
molecules, including integrins and other tetraspanins (8, 9).
Lately, tetraspanins have also gained attention as both suppressors and promoters of metastasis depending on the particular tetraspanins (10). Therefore, tetraspanins have emerged
as diagnostic and prognostic markers, as well as therapeutic
targets for preventing tumor progression (10, 11).
TM4SF5 is highly expressed in colon carcinomas, pancreatic
tumors, and HCC (12, 13). Lee and colleagues showed that
TM4SF5 is involved in HCC development, speciﬁcally by
inducing morphological elongation, epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT), uncontrolled cell proliferation, and angiogenesis (13, 14). A synthetic inhibitor targeting TM4SF5, 40 -(ptoluenesulfonyl-amido)-4-hydroxychalcone (TSAHC), has
been shown to inhibit HCC growth and metastasis in vitro
and in vivo (15). Therefore, TM4SF5 seems to play an important
role in HCC formation, and it is a rational molecular target for
the clinical development of HCC therapeutics (16).
In previous studies, we produced a TM4SF5-speciﬁc monoclonal antibody by immunizing mice with a peptide corresponding to a B-cell epitope of human TM4SF5 (denoted the
hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide); this peptide was coencapsulated with
CpG-DNA in a phosphatidyl-b-oleoyl-g-palmitoyl ethanolamine:cholesterol hemisuccinate (DOPE:CHEMS) liposome
complex [called Lipoplex(O); ref. 17]. We then conﬁrmed that
the antibody markedly delayed the growth of the Huh-7 human
HCC cell line, which express endogenous TM4SF5 (18). We also

Antitumor Activity of an Anti-TM4SF5 Antibody

showed that active immunization with the peptide vaccine had
prevented the growth of tumors from subsequently transplanted HCC cells and suppressed the growth of tumors in
mice bearing mouse HCC cell–derived tumors (18, 19).
Herein, we analyzed expression of TM4SF5 in human HCC
tissue samples using an anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody.
We also assessed the anti-invasiveness and antimigratory
properties of the antibody in vitro in HCC cells. Finally, we
measured in vivo antitumor activity of the antibody against
mouse-derived and human-derived HCC tumors in mice and
found that passive immunization, by intraperitoneal injection
of this monoclonal antibody, inhibits the progression of tumors in these mouse models of HCC. Therefore, we provide
direct evidence that anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody can
be a potential therapeutics to treat HCC.

Materials and Methods
Production of the mouse antihuman TM4SF5R2-3
monoclonal antibody
As described previously (17, 20), BALB/c mice were injected
intraperitoneally with the hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide derived from
human TM4SF5 (138NRTLWDRCEAPPRV151) and CpG-DNA
coencapsulated in a DOPE:CHEMS complex four times, each
at 10-day intervals. In accordance with the standard hybridoma puriﬁcation protocols, we screened for hybridoma cells
that produced the anti-hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide-speciﬁc monoclonal antibody (21). The anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody
(IgG2a) was puriﬁed from the ascitic ﬂuid by protein A column
chromatography.
Surface plasmon resonance analysis
The binding afﬁnity of the anti-hTM4SF5 monoclonal antibody to the human (hTM4SF5R2-3) and mouse TM4SF5R2-3
peptides (mTM4SF5R2-3) was measured using Biacore 3000 at
25 C. Biotinylated peptides were captured on the ﬂow cell
surface of a SA sensor chip coated with streptavidin. Injection
of a buffer solution containing biotin served as a negative
control. Data were evaluated using Biacore Bia evaluation
software version 4.1 (Biacore). The data were analyzed using
ﬁtting models for the ligand–analyte interaction such as 1:1
(Langmuir) binding, 1:1 binding with drifting baseline, 1:1
binding with mass transfer, and bivalent analyte. Based on
the results, 1:1 binding with mass transfer was selected as a
best model. The parameters such as association rate (ka),
dissociation rate (kd), the equilibrium dissociation constant
(binding constant, KD, kd/ka), and the c2 value were calculated
using the software. The sensorgram data were extracted using
the software and the graphs were reproduced using Microsoft
Excel program to show the binding afﬁnity.
Tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry
For the HCC and normal tissue analysis, formalin-ﬁxed,
parafﬁn-embedded AccuMax tissue arrays were purchased
from ISU ABXIS with the approval of the Institutional Review
Board in Hallym University. The following arrays were used:
normal tissues [A103(8)], various human cancer tissues with
corresponding normal tissues [A301(VI)], and human liver

www.aacrjournals.org

cancer tissues [A204, A204(II), and A204(III)]. The tissue arrays
were stained with the anti-hTM4SF5 monoclonal antibody
(10 mg/mL), according to standard procedures. The percentages of cells expressing TM4SF5 were calculated as the
number of TM4SF5-positive cells divided by the total number
of cells in each tumor type.
Cell culture
The human HCC cell lines, Huh-7 and SNU-739, were
obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS). The cell lines were characterized by the cell bank
using DNA ﬁngerprinting analysis, species veriﬁcation test,
mycoplasma contamination test, and viral contamination
test. Mouse BNL 1ME A.7R.1 HCC cells (BNL-HCC cells) were
obtained from ATCC (ATCC TIB-75) and maintained in
DMEM containing 10% FBS. ATCC characterized the cell
line with tests for morphology, post-freeze viability, interspecies determination (isoenzyme analysis), mycoplasma
contamination, and bacterial and fungal contamination. All
cells were cultured at 37 C in an atmosphere containing 5%
CO2. We made stocks for each cell line at early passages, and
cultures were maintained until passage 20 (within 2 months)
and then discarded.
In vitro cell migration and invasion assays
Trans-well chambers with 8-mm porosity were used for these
assays. For migration assays, the lower side of the trans-well
chamber membranes was coated with gelatin (10 mg/well). For
invasion assays, the upper and lower sides of the chamber
membranes were coated with Matrigel (1.2 mg/mL; BD Biosciences) and gelatin, respectively. Huh-7 cells and SNU-739
cells were suspended (1.6–3.3  105 cells/mL) in serum-free
medium with mouse IgG2a isotype control (IgG2a control;
Bethyl Laboratories) or the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody
(10 mg/mL) and placed on the top of the trans-well chamber.
RPMI medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower
chamber. After incubation for 12 to 72 hours, the cells that
invaded to the lower surface of the ﬁlters were ﬁxed, stained
with crystal violet, and counted under a microscope (E-200,
Nikon).
In vitro wound-healing assays
For wound-healing assays, 1  106 cells (Huh-7 cells or SNU739 cells) were placed in a 6-well plate, cultured overnight to
conﬂuence in medium containing serum, and the monolayer
was wounded with a pipette tip. PBS, IgG2a control, or the antihTM4SF5 monoclonal antibody (10 mg/mL) was added to the
medium for the indicated times. The cells were ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes and stained with Giemsa
for 30 minutes. The number of cells that migrated into the
wounded area was counted in three wells per experimental
treatment and three wounds per well under a microscope
(TS100, Nikon).
Confocal microscopy
Cells were cultured on glass cover slips in 12-well plates 18
hours before treatment with the anti-hTM4SF5 monoclonal

antibody (10 mg/mL). After treatment with the antibody for
the indicated times, the cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained
with the anti-p27kip1 antibody (Rabbit monoclonal Ab; Cell
Signaling Technology, Cat. No. 3686) or the anti-E-cadherin
antibody (two different antibodies: rabbit monoclonal antibody for Fig. 3; Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. No. 3195 and
rabbit polyclonal antibody for Supplementary Fig. S6; Abcam,
Cat. No. ab15148) for 2 hours. After extensive washing in PBS,
the samples were incubated with Alexa Flour 488 (or Alexa
Flour 546)–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 hour. The
nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258, and the mounted
samples were scanned with an LSM 710 (Carl Zeiss).
Biodistribution imaging in vivo
Five mg/mL of the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody and
IgG2a control (or normal mouse IgG) in PBS solution was
adjusted to contain 50 mmol/L borate buffer (pH 8.5). Proteins
were conjugated with DyLight 755 and puriﬁed using a DyLight
755 Antibody Labeling Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc) in accordance
with the manufacturer's speciﬁcations. Fifty micrograms of
DyLight 755–labeled anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody or
DyLight 755–labeled IgG2a control (or normal mouse IgG)
was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity of BALB/c control
mice or mice bearing BNL-HCC cell–derived tumors. The
distribution proﬁles of the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody
were quantiﬁed by in vivo ﬂuorescence using the real-time
IVIS imaging system 200 (Xenogen Corp.) at the indicated
time intervals. To determine the distribution of the DyLight
755–labeled anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody in HCC tumor
tissues, the tissues were removed aseptically at 72 hours after
injection. The tissues were frozen and cut into 4-mm-thick
slices using Cryostat. The slices were stained with SYTOX
Green dye for nuclei, and the mounted samples were scanned
with an LSM 710.
Animals
Four-week-old male BALB/cAnCrj-nu/nu mice and BALB/c
mice were obtained from Central Lab. Animal Inc. The mice
were maintained under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions. All
procedures involving animal studies were in accordance with
the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Veterinary Research &
Quarantine Service of Korea. The protocol was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Hallym
University (Permit Number: Hallym 2010-10, Hallym 2012-66,
Hallym 2013-104). The mice were sacriﬁced under Zoletil
50þRompun anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize
suffering.
HCC mouse model
For the xenograft assays, 30 BALB/cAnCrj-nu/nu mice were
inoculated subcutaneously in the dorsal right ﬂank with
5  106 Huh-7 cells in 50% Matrigel as previously described
(22). When tumors reached 5 mm in diameter, the mice were
randomly divided into three treatment groups (8 mice/group):
PBS, IgG2a control, and the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody. The antibodies (25 mg/kg) were injected twice weekly

3846

into the intraperitoneal cavity. Tumor diameters were measured using calipers at 4-day intervals, and tumor volumes
were calculated using the formula, width2  length/2, as
described previously (18). The mice were sacriﬁced 40 days
after Huh-7 cells injection and the tumors were weighed.
For the syngeneic transplanted tumor assay, 30 BALB/c mice
were inoculated subcutaneously in the dorsal right ﬂank with
5  106 BNL-HCC cells containing 50% Matrigel and the
effects of injected PBS, normal IgG control, and the antiTM4SF5 monoclonal antibody were evaluated as described
above. Tumor diameters were measured at 7-day intervals,
and tumor volumes were calculated. BALB/c mice were sacriﬁced 10 weeks after antibody injection, and the tumors were
weighed.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
For histopathologic examinations, the tumors and organs
were removed and ﬁxed in a 4% buffered formalin solution
overnight, embedded in parafﬁn using standard methods,
and cut into 5-mm-thick sections. The deparafﬁnized sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
To assess the expression of TM4SF5, the deparafﬁnized
sections were stained with the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody (10 mg/mL), according to standard procedures
using Histostain Plus Kit. The samples were then counterstained with hematoxylin. All images were examined using a
Nikon Eclipse E-200 microscope (Nikon).
Statistics
Results are expressed as mean  SD. Statistical signiﬁcance
between two samples was evaluated using the Student t test.
A P-value of <0.05 was taken as statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Speciﬁcity and afﬁnity of the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody
As previous data had shown that an anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody reacted against mouse TM4SF5, we sought
to explore its speciﬁcity toward the human protein. To do
this, we isolated an anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody
(clone #2D4-18) through hybridoma technology using spleen
cells obtained from mice that had been immunized with a
complex of TM4SF5 B-cell epitope (hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide)
and Lipoplex(O), without carriers. The monoclonal antibody
was puriﬁed from the ascitic ﬂuid to high purity (Supplementary Fig. S1A). We investigated the reactivity of this
anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody against the human and
mouse TM4SF5R2-3 peptides using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody reacted with both the human and mouse
TM4SF5R2-3 peptides (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C).
The cross-reactivity of this anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody was also conﬁrmed by a competitive ELISA assay.
Mouse TM4SF5R2-3 peptide efﬁciently inhibited the ability
of the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody to bind the human
TM4SF5R2-3 peptide (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and vice
versa (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Our microarray data

revealed that TM4SF4 and TM4SF5 genes are highly
expressed in Huh-7 cells compared with control SNU-739
cells (GEO accession number GSE57106; Supplementary
Fig. S2A). To further conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of this antibody, we analyzed its reactivity with the synthesized peptides derived from other human TM4SF members such as
TM4SF1, TM4SF4, TM4SF18, and TM4SF19 (Supplementary

It has been reported that TM4SF5 mRNA is expressed in
colon carcinoma, pancreatic tumors, and HCC, as determined
by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Northern blotting (12).
Here, we investigated the expression of the TM4SF5 protein in
various human tissues including human HCC specimens by
immunohistochemical staining with the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody to validate the presence of the target in HCC.
First, we evaluated the expression and distribution of TM4SF5

immunohistochemistry. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3,
TM4SF5 was not expressed in normal tissues. Next, the expression of TM4SF5 protein from different tumor types was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 1C–F
and Table 1, there was no expression of TM4SF5 in normal
liver, however all of the HCC tissues expressed TM4SF5 (staining of >11% of the tumor cells present in all samples). Analysis
of 105 HCC specimens showed that 30% of HCC tissue samples
expressed TM4SF5 in >75% of the tumor cells, and 45% and 25%
of HCC were positive for TM4SF5 expression with 50% to 74%
and 11% to 49% (Table 1). The levels of TM4SF5 immunostaining did not correlate with tumor grade or stage (Supplementary
Fig. S4). In addition to HCC, TM4SF5 expression was also
detected in colon cancer and pancreatic cancer tissues, in
agreement with the previously published mRNA data (Fig. 1G
and H; ref. 12). These results conﬁrm that this monoclonal
antibody is useful for TM4SF5 protein detection in human
tissues. In contrast, prominent expression of TM4SF5 was not
detected in other cancer types we tested (Supplementary Fig.
S5). Considering a recent report that 45% of human esophageal
cancer tissues showed expression of TM4SF5 in >50% of the
tumor cells (23) and the fact that the cancer tissue array we
used was composed of just one case per each cancer, detailed
studies are required to clarify the implication of TM4SF5 in
other cancer types.
Effect of the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody on
human HCC cell migration
The tetraspanin superfamily, including TM4SF5, activates
integrin-mediated signaling pathways that are pivotal for cell
migration/invasion and tumor cell metastasis (10, 13, 14).
Therefore, we evaluated the inﬂuence of the anti-TM4SF5
antibody on cell migration and invasion using human HCC
cells of Huh-7 cell line–expressing TM4SF5. As shown in Fig. 2A
and B, we found that the addition of the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody, but not PBS or IgG2a control, inhibited the
migration of Huh-7 cells. In contrast, the antibody had little
effect on the migration of SNU-739 cells that do not express
TM4SF5. In addition, we performed a wound-healing assay in
vitro. As shown in Fig. 2C, the migration of Huh-7 cells into the
wounded area was signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence of the
anti-TM4SF5 antibody but not PBS or IgG2a control. However,
there was no difference in wound-healing capacity in SNU-739
cells treated with IgG2a control or the anti-TM4SF5 antibody

3848

(Fig. 2C). These results conﬁrm that targeting TM4SF5 with
this antibody reduces HCC cell motility in vitro.
Effect of the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody on
E-cadherin expression and actin organization in HCC
cells
E-cadherin is one of membrane adhesion molecules involved
in cell–cell interaction, and reduced E-cadherin expression is
associated with EMT and metastasis (24). As the anti-TM4SF5
antibody reduces mobility of HCC cells, we then investigated
expression of E-cadherin after treatment of Huh-7 cells and
SNU-739 cells with anti-TM4SF5 antibody. First, we monitored
E-cadherin expression by immunostaining and confocal
microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, E-cadherin expression
was enhanced by the anti-TM4SF5 antibody in Huh-7 cells but
not SNU-739 cells. There was no change in the cells treated with
PBS or IgG2a control (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S6).
Accordingly, total E-cadherin protein expression increased
following treatment of Huh-7 cells with the anti-TM4SF5
antibody, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 3C). There
was no change in expression of E-cadherin in SNU-739 cells
after antibody treatment.
Next, we monitored actin organization in Huh-7 cells and
SNU-739 cells after treatment with PBS, IgG2a control, or
anti-TM4SF5 antibody using Phalloidin staining as well as
paxillin staining. PBS and IgG2a control-treated Huh-7 cells
displayed aberrant actin bundling, but treatment with the
anti-TM4SF5 antibody resulted in the formation of welldeﬁned stress ﬁbers (Supplementary Fig. S7A). In contrast,
the well-deﬁned stress ﬁbers in SNU-739 cells supporting
polygonal morphology were unaffected by treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Staining of the focal adhesion molecule
paxillin also revealed that the number of focal adhesion sites

anti-TM4SF5 antibody (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Taken
together, these results indicate that the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody modulates actin polymerization in TM4SF5expressing cells.

cell-cycle progression (25). When we treated the TM4SF5expressing Huh-7 cells with anti-TM4SF5 antibody, we found
that growth of Huh-7 cells were suppressed (18). Furthermore,
previous study showed that p27kip1 is localized in the cytosol of
HCC cells overexpressing TM4SF5 (26). Therefore, we examined expression and localization of p27kip1 in Huh-7 and SNU739 cells. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy revealed
that p27kip1 expression was not clearly detected in the nucleus
of Huh-7 cells before treatment with the anti-TM4SF5 antibody. However, following treatment with the anti-TM4SF5
antibody, p27kip1 staining was clearly observed in the nucleus
(Fig. 3D). In contrast, p27kip1 localization did not change after
treatment with the anti-TM4SF5 antibody in SNU-739 cells

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 3E). Western blotting showed no prominent change in
the total levels of p27kip1 protein expression in either cell line
(Fig. 3F). Therefore, treatment with the anti-TM4SF5 antibody induces the translocation of p27kip1 from the cytosol to
the nucleus and the nuclear p27kip1 may suppress cell growth
in Huh-7 cells.
RhoA is a small G protein involved in contact inhibition
and regulates the actin cytoskeleton in the formation of stress
ﬁbers (27). Furthermore, RhoA has been reported to be negatively regulated by p27kip1 via a protein–protein interaction
(28–30). Therefore, translocation of p27kip1 into the nucleus
after treatment with anti-TM4SF5 antibody may reduce
its interaction with RhoA and may enhance RhoA activity.

As expected, the interaction between p27kip1 and RhoA
decreased and RhoA activity increased following treatment of
Huh-7 cells with the anti-TM4SF5 antibody (Supplementary
Fig. S7C and S7D). Treatment of Huh-7 cells with normal IgG
had no effect. There was no effect in SNU-739 cells after
treatment with normal IgG or anti-TM4SF5 antibody. Taken
together, these results suggest that the treatment of TM4SF5expressing HCC cells with anti-TM4SF5 antibody induces
intracellular molecular events, leading to growth inhibition
and enhanced adhesion.

Localization of the injected anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody on HCC tumors in vivo
Given that the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody can inhibit the growth, invasion, and migration of tumor cell lines, we
next investigated whether it had any effect on tumors in vivo.
First, we sought to determine distribution of the anti-TM4SF5
monoclonal antibody after injection using a syngeneic transplanted tumor model established with mouse BNL-HCC cells.
The anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody and mouse IgG2a
control were conjugated with DyLight 755 (a ﬂuorescent dye)

and injected into the intraperitoneal cavity of mice harboring
BNL-HCC cell–derived tumors. After 72 hours, the distribution
of the DyLight 755–labeled antibody was quantiﬁed by measuring the total photon ﬂux (photons/sec) of the ﬂuorescence.
As shown in Fig. 4A and B, the DyLight 755–labeled antiTM4SF5 monoclonal antibody was localized in the tumors,
whereas DyLight 755–labeled IgG2a control was not detected
in the mice. When we excised the tumor mass and analyzed
microsections of the frozen tissue, we found that many of the
tumor cells were stained with the DyLight 755–labeled antiTM4SF5 antibody (Fig. 4C). In contrast, we could not detect any
labeling in the control sections obtained from mice injected
with DyLight 755–labeled IgG2a control.
Next, we injected the DyLight 755–labeled anti-TM4SF5
monoclonal antibody into the intraperitoneal cavity of control mice and mice harboring tumors to examine the timedependent distribution of the DyLight 755–labeled antibody
over 96 hours. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S8, the
highest ﬂuorescence was detected in the abdominal region
at 0 hour, and the signal became gradually distributed
throughout the whole body over 12 hours. The ﬂuorescence
signal was focused in the tumor region between 24 and 96
hours in the tumor-bearing mice. However, the ﬂuorescence
gradually disappeared in the normal mice possibly because
of secretion (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S8). Therefore,
the anti-hTM4SF5 monoclonal antibody can target tumor
cells expressing TM4SF5 in vivo.
The anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody inhibits HCC
tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model
To evaluate the efﬁcacy of the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody against HCC tumors in mice, we determined the
effect of the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody on the growth
of HCC cells in vivo using a xenograft mouse model, which
involves human cells, before the syngeneic transplanted tumor
model. We injected nude mice subcutaneously in the dorsal
right ﬂank with Huh-7 cells and allowed the tumors to grow.
When the tumor reached 5 mm in diameter, the animals were
treated with mouse IgG2a control or anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody by intraperitoneal injection. Using both tumor volume and weight as measures, we observed that the antibody
attenuated the progression of HCC tumors compared with PBS
or IgG2a control-treated animals (Fig. 5A–C). However, antibody treatment did not affect the body weight of the mice
during this experiment, suggesting that the antibody has no
prominent side effects (Fig. 5D). The expression of TM4SF5 in
HCC xenograft tumor tissue was conﬁrmed by immunohistochemistry using the anti-TM4SF5 antibody (Fig. 5E). Together, these experiments suggest that the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody can attenuate tumor grown in mouse xenograft
models of HCC.
The anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody inhibits HCC
tumor growth in a syngeneic transplanted tumor model
To investigate whether the effect of the anti-TM4SF5 antibody on HCC tumor growth was maintained in a syngeneic
transplanted tumor model, we used BNL-HCC cells. As shown
in Fig. 6A–C, treatment with the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal

www.aacrjournals.org

antibody signiﬁcantly suppressed the progression of HCC
tumors compared with the mice treated with control IgG. The
anti-hTM4SF5 antibody did not affect the body weight of mice
during the experiment, suggesting that the antibody has no
prominent side effects (Fig. 6D). Together, these experiments
suggest that the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody can inhibit
tumor growth in mouse syngeneic transplanted tumor models
of HCC.

Discussion
In this study, we conﬁrmed that the TM4SF5 protein is
overexpressed in human HCC, colon, and pancreatic cancer
tissues using a high-afﬁnity monoclonal antibody against
TM4SF5. Interestingly, TM4SF5 expression was detected in all
of the HCC tissue samples we examined, at various expression
levels (Table 1). Therefore, we focused on HCC in this study;
however, further investigation of TM4SF5 expression and
function in colon and pancreatic cancer is warranted. In
previous studies, we found that treatment with the antiTM4SF5 monoclonal antibody inhibited the growth of human
and mouse HCC cells and accordingly decreased the proportion of cells in S-phase (18). Here, we further investigated in
vitro and in vivo effects of anti-TM4SF5 antibody and the
molecular mechanisms underlying the functional effects.
Treatment of Huh-7 cells with the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody signiﬁcantly inhibited cell motility in vitro,
as determined by migration, invasion, and wound-healing
assays (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the expression of E-cadherin,
stress ﬁber formation, and focal adhesion in Huh-7 cells was
enhanced in response to the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3). Taken together, we can conclude that antiTM4SF5 antibody provoke multiple in vitro anticancer
effects including reduced cell growth, reduced motility, and
enhanced adhesion.
E-cadherin, a member of calcium-dependent adhesion
molecules mainly expressed in epithelial cells, is known to
be downregulated in the situation of EMT and metastasis
(24). Enhanced expression of E-cadherin in response to
anti-TM4SF5 antibody treatment suggests a possibility that
TM4SF5 suppresses transcription of E-cadherin and the
anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody prevents the activity of
TM4SF5. Tetraspanins are components of microdomains
that involve many different molecules, such as extracellular
matrix proteins, adhesion molecules, cytokine receptors, and
integrins (8, 9). Therefore, the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody may also contribute to the interaction of TM4SF5
with adhesion molecules, such as E-cadherin, by stabilizing
the cell–cell contacts, as has previously been suggested for
antibody-based immunotherapeutics targeting another tetraspanin, CD151 (11).
Fine regulation of RhoA activity is tightly associated with
motility, and CDK inhibitors, such as p27kip1, p21WAF1, and p57,
are known to modulate motility through interruption of
the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway (28–30). Treatment of
Huh-7 cells with the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody
induced the translocation of p27kip1 from the cytosol into the
nucleus (Fig. 3). p27kip1 can play a role as a G1 check point in

the nucleus, which might contribute to the decrease in the
S-phase population and the reduced tumor cell growth
observed in response to the anti-TM4SF5 antibody (18). Furthermore, translocation of p27kip1 was accompanied by the
reduced association of p27kip1 and RhoA and enhanced RhoA
activity (Supplementary Fig. S7). Previously, Lee and colleagues
demonstrated that overexpression of TM4SF5 induces loss
of contact inhibition through EMT (13). They revealed that
TM4SF5 overexpression enhanced the expression of p27kip1 in
the cytosol, reduced RhoA activity, and reduced E-cadherin
expression. Therefore, treatment of TM4SF5-expressing
cells with an anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody reverses the
molecular events induced by TM4SF5 overexpression. Taken
together, our results suggest that the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody blocks tumorigenic TM4SF5 signaling, which inhibits
tumor cell growth and modulates the adhesion and migration
properties of TM4SF5-expressing cells in vitro. Our results

also suggest a possible application of anti-TM4SF5 antibody
for therapy against HCC.
To conﬁrm the antitumor activity of the anti-TM4SF5
monoclonal antibody in vivo, we administered the antiTM4SF5 antibody into mice bearing tumors composed of
human or mouse HCC cells. The anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody localized to HCC tumors in mice (Fig. 4), and it
signiﬁcantly suppressed tumor growth (Figs. 5 and 6). Therefore, our results demonstrate that this anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody has therapeutic effects in a mouse model of
HCC and suggest that using this TM4SF5-speciﬁc monoclonal
antibody could be investigated as a therapeutic strategy for
HCC in humans.
The antitumor activity of the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody in vivo can be partially explained by the direct tumor
suppressing activity of this antibody revealed in vitro. In
addition, the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity

(ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) could
play a role in vivo. ADCC involving antibodies and Fc receptors
of cytotoxic cells such as NK cells, macrophages, and neurophiles is known to be an important mechanism involved in the
antitumor function of therapeutic antibodies such as trastuzumab and tituximab (31). Antigen-speciﬁc antibodies can
trigger CDC through the classical complement pathway (32).
Therefore, the immunologic function of anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody in mice has to be examined. Induction of the
antibody-mediated effector function is highly dependent on
the isotype of the antibody, and most of the potent therapeutic
antibodies on the market are IgG1 (33) probably because IgG1
is the most abundant IgG subclass in human serum and has
high afﬁnity for Fc receptors on phagocytic cells in human (34).

3854

Cancer Res; 74(14) July 15, 2014

The anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody used in this study is the
isotype IgG2a. As IgG2a has extremely low afﬁnity for Fc
Receptors on phagocytic cells in human (34), further consideration of the isotype may be required for the future application of this antibody in humans. Considering that TM4SF5 is
involved in EMT and metastasis (13–16), and that the treatment of TM4SF5-expressing cells with the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody reduced motility and enhanced expression of
E-cadherin, the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody may have
antimetastatic activity and therefore may be able to contribute
to preventing metastasis in patients with primary HCC. Therefore, this topic warrants further investigation in the future.
In this study, we validated anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody as an efﬁcacious therapeutics in mouse syngeneic
