ABSTRACT:
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common potentially lethal
human malignancies worldwide. Advanced or recurrent HCC is frequently resistant
to conventional chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. Therefore, targeted agents
with tolerable toxicity are mandatory to improve HCC therapy and prognosis. In this
neoplasia, the PI3K/Akt signaling network has been frequently shown to be aberrantly
up-regulated. To evaluate whether Akt could represent a target for treatment of HCC,
we studied the effects of the allosteric Akt inhibitor, MK-2206, on a panel of HCC cell
lines characterized by different levels of Akt-1 activation. The inhibitor decreased
cell viability and induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, with a
higher efficacy in cells with hyperphosphorylated Akt-1. Moreover, MK-2206 induced
apoptosis, as documented by Annexin V labeling, and also caused autophagy, as
evidenced by increased levels of the autophagy marker LC3A/B. Autophagy was
shown to be a protective mechanism against MK-2206 cytotoxicity. MK-2206 downregulated, in a concentration-dependent manner, the phosphorylation levels of Akt1 and its downstream targets, GSK3 α/β and FOXO3A. MK-2206 synergized with
doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug widely used for HCC treatment. Our findings
suggest that the use of Akt inhibitors, either alone or in combination with doxorubicin,
may be considered as an attractive therapeutic regimen for the treatment of HCC.

INTRODUCTION

signaling cascades that sustain HCC cell proliferation,
survival, and drug-resistance. Sorafenib, a Raf kinase
inhibitor, became the first drug to receive FDA approval
for HCC, after being demonstrated to increase postdiagnosis mean survival of patients with advanced HCC
and cirrhosis from approximately 8 to 11 months [3-5].
These results have triggered the search for other additional
molecular targets to further improve HCC patient survival
[6, 7].
The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a central
role in regulating cell proliferation, migration, survival

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
deadly cancers worldwide with only few therapeutic
options for patients with advanced disease, since it usually
develops on the background of chronic liver disease and
conventional anticancer therapies are not effective [1]. For
example, the patient response rate to doxorubicin, the most
widely used chemotherapeutic agent for HCC, is between
2% and 10% [2]. Therefore, major efforts are being made
to develop rationally targeted therapies against altered

and angiogenesis [3, 8]. Activation of phosphoinositide
dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Akt by class IA PI3Ks
(which includes PI3K p110α) is negatively regulated
by PTEN, that converts phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] to phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] [9]. However, this
signaling pathway is involved not only in physiological
processes, but also in the development of cancers,
including HCC [8, 10-12]. In HCC, deregulation of the
PI3K/Akt pathway is the result of multiple molecular
mechanisms, including activating mutations of PI3K
p110α catalytic subunit, loss of expression of its negative
regulator, the lipid phosphatase and tensin homolog
deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) or aberrant activation
of receptor tyrosine kinases [13]. PTEN was demonstrated
to be involved in HCC pathogenesis and in increased
tumor grade and poor prognosis. [14, 15].
Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 was detected
in up to 71% of HCC samples, and was associated with
invasion, metastasis and vascularization [16]. The same
authors, using a panel of HCC cell lines, demonstrated that
Akt-1 is widely represented and is the most abundantly
expressed Akt isoform. Activated Akt is known to inhibit
apoptosis through its ability to phosphorylate several
targets, including BAD, FoxO transcription factors, Raf1 and caspase-9, which are critical for cell survival [17].
However, the clinical relevance of the PI3K/Akt
pathway as an innovative target in HCC and its therapeutic
potential remain to be further elucidated, in parallel with
our growing knowledge of the role of signaling pathways
and their alterations involved in HCC pathogenesis.
MK-2206 is a novel, orally active, allosteric

Akt inhibitor which is being tested both in preclinical
settings and clinical trials as an anticancer agent. It can
synergistically enhance the antitumor effect of some
conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and molecular
targeted agents in lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast
cancer and acute leukemias [18, 19].
In this study, we analyzed the cytotoxic activity of
MK-2206 in HCC cell lines displaying different levels of
Akt-1 phosphorylation. We documented that MK-2206
was much more cytotoxic to cell lines (Mahlavu and
SNU475) displaying higher levels of Akt-1 activation
than to cell lines with lower levels of activated Akt-1
(PLC, SNU387). Treatments of HCC cells with MK2206 caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the
cell cycle, induced apoptosis and autophagy. However,
autophagy was a protective mechanisms against MK-2206
cytotoxicity. Moreover, MK-2206 potently synergized
with doxorubicin in Mahlavu cells. These findings
suggested that targeting Akt-1 with MK-2206, alone or
in combination with conventional chemotherapy, may
represent a new promising therapeutic approach in the
treatment of HCC with hyperphosphorylated Akt-1.

RESULTS
Akt-1 phosphorylation levels in HCC cell lines are
related to PTEN expression
We first analyzed the basal expression of Akt-1 and
its phosphorylation status on Ser473 on a panel of human

HCC cell lines (PLC, SNU387, Mahlavu, SNU449 and
SNU475 cells). Akt-1 total amount was similar in the
five cell lines examined (Fig. 1A). On the contrary, the
phosphorylation status of the protein, as documented
by Western blot analysis with an antibody to Ser 473
p-Akt-1, showed relevant differences: in PLC cells a
negligible phosphorylation level of Akt-1 was observable,
in SNU387 cells only a slight Akt-1 phosphorylation was
detectable, whereas a significant Akt-1 phosphorylation
was detectable in Mahlavu, SNU449 and SNU475 cells.
SNU387 cells in comparison with PLC cells showed a
decrease of PTEN protein. A lower expression in SNU449
or loss of PTEN protein in Mahlavu and SNU475
cell lines, respectively, was associated with Akt-1
hyperphosphorylation. Therefore, our initial observations
suggested that Mahlavu, SNU449 and SNU475 cells
displayed hyperactivated Akt-1 when compared with PLC
and SNU387 HCC cell lines.

hyperphosphorylated one. Both cell lines were treated
with increasing concentrations of MK-2206 for 24h, after
which time the cells were harvested, fixed and stained with
Propidium Iodide (PI) for the MuseTM Cell Analyzer. The
analysis documented a not significant increase in the G0/
G1 phase of the cell cycle in PLC cells whereas a striking
concentration-dependent increase in the G0/G1 phase of the
cell cycle and a concomitant decrease in the S and G2/M
phases were detected in Mahlavu cells (Fig. 1B).

Real-time, dynamic monitoring of cell growth in
HCC cells treated with MK-2206
To further analyze the activity of MK-2206 in HCC
cells, we used a novel cell surveillance system to monitor
the dynamic changes in cell growth based on the electrical
impedance measurement technique (xCELLigence
System). The xCELLigence System allowed us to study
the effects of MK-2206 on HCC cells by a label-free
and a real-time native approach. After the setting of the
proliferation standards of PLC, SNU387, Mahlavu and
SNU475 cells, we studied the cytotoxicity of the inhibitor
at increasing concentrations. The plots demonstrated the
concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect of
MK-2206 on PLC and Mahlavu cells (Fig. 2A) and the
IC50 values of the drug at 24h of treatment was obtained
by this technique: 18 μM for PLC, 16 μM for SNU387,
6.4 μM for Mahlavu and 6.7 μM for SNU475 cells,

MK-2206 blocks in the G0/G1 phase of the cell
cycle HCC cells with hyperphosphorylated Akt-1
Given the importance of the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway in the regulation of cell proliferation [20], the
effects of MK-2206 on cell cycle progression of HCC
cells were investigated. The analysis was carried out on
PLC and Mahlavu cells, to compare the drug effect in an
Akt-1 non-hyperphosphorylated cell line versus an Akt-1

respectively (Fig.2B).
We also analyzed the Cell Index after 24h of
treatment with MK-2206 at different concentrations. As
shown in Fig. 2C, Mahlavu and SNU475 cells were more
sensitive to MK-2206 than PLC and SNU387 cells. It is
noticeable a correlation between the lower concentration
of drug needed to attain IC50 values and the levels of
hyperphosphorylated Akt-1 in Mahlavu and SNU475 cells.

either cell survival or cell death, depending on the cellular
context and/or initiating stimulus [22].
To examine the effects of MK-2206 on autophagy in
human HCC cell lines, we treated Mahlavu and SNU475
cell lines with the Akt inhibitor and then we assessed the
conversion of LC3A/BI to LC3A/BII, as an autophagy
marker [23-25]. Western Blot analysis documented, after
4h of treatment with MK-2206, an increase in the lipidated
form of LC3A/B (LC3A/BII) in the two cell lines (Fig.
3C). To understand if autophagy was either a cell survival
or a cell death mechanism, we inhibited this process using
the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine [26] and then measured
the Cell Index in Mahlavu cells. Chloroquine alone did not
affect Mahlavu cell growth, even at the concentration of 10
µM. However, when Mahlavu cells were simultaneously
treated with chloroquine and MK-2206, administered at
the IC50 value, they became more sensitive than to MK2206 alone, i.e. MK-2206 became more cytotoxic in the
presence of 10 µM chloroquine (Fig. 3D).

MK-2206 induces both apoptosis and autophagy
in HCC cells
In order to establish whether decreased cell growth
was related to apoptosis in HCC cell lines, we analyzed
programmed cell death by Annexin-V/7-AAD-assay
using the MuseTM Cell Analyzer. PLC and Mahlavu cells
were treated with increasing concentrations of MK-2206
for 24h and then analyzed for Annexin-V labeling. MK2206 induced concentration-dependent apoptosis in both
cell lines. However, at 5 µM concentration of MK-2206,
apoptosis was 11.7% in PLC cells, (Fig. 3A), whereas it
reached 51.6 % in Mahlavu cells (Fig. 3B).
Recently, the inhibition of Akt has been shown to
possess autophagy-inducing effects in addition to proapoptotic effect [21]. Induction of autophagy can promote

MK-2206 regulates PI3K/Akt signaling and
induces MEK/ERK1/2 upregulation
In order to investigate the effects of MK-2206
on Akt-1 and its downstream targets, we analyzed the

differences (p<0.05) in comparison with control (CTRL). BK represents the unstained samples. In both cell lines the apoptotic process

modulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in Mahlavu and
SNU475 cells. After a 4h incubation with MK-2206,
a concentration-dependent decrease in p-Akt-1 levels
was detected in all cell lines (Fig. 4A). The decrease
was already detectable at 1 μM. In contrast, total Akt-1
levels were not affected by MK-2206. Akt inhibition had
functional consequences on the phosphorylation of two
well-established Akt substrates, GSK3-α/β and FoxO3A.
Both proteins displayed dephosphorylation at amino acidic
residues (Ser 21/9 for GSK3-α/β and Thr-32 for FoxO3A)
that are targeted by Akt. The amounts of total GSK3- α/β
and FoxO3A were unchanged.
Compensatory activation of parallel signaling
through the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway in response to PI3K/
Akt inhibition, is an emerging theme in cancer cell
signal transduction. Indeed, several recent reports have
highlighted the importance of functional cross talks
between the MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling
networks, in response to individual pathway inhibitors
[20, 27-31].
For this reason, we examined the status of p-ERK1/2
phosphorylation in both Mahlavu and SNU475 cell lines,
after treatment for 24h with increasing concentrations of
MK-2206. In both cell lines, we detected a concentrationdependent increase in the phosphorylation levels of
p-ERK1/2, whereas the total protein amount remained
unchanged (Fig. 4B).
To establish if this activation was dependent on

MEK activity, we inhibited MEK in Mahlavu cells with
the MEK-specific allosteric inhibitor, AZD6244 [32]. As
shown in Fig. 4C, the drug completely prevented the MK2206 induced up-regulation of p-ERK1/2.
Furthermore, we performed an MTT assay to
determine if a combined treatment (MK-2206 plus
AZD6244) would further decrease cell viability at 24h.
When the two drugs were administered together, cell
viability decreased significantly when compared with
either drug alone (Fig. 4D).

Down-regulation of Akt-1 reduces MK-2206
cytotoxicity in Mahlavu cells
To further evaluate the inhibition of Akt-1 signaling
as a major molecular target responsible for the effects
of MK-2206 in HCC cells, we down-regulated protein
expression of Akt-1 in Mahlavu cells by using siRNA.
After 24h of transfection, we first examined by Western
blotting the decrease of Akt-1 expression. As shown in Fig.
5A, Akt-1 siRNA significantly reduced the expression of
Akt-1 protein. Down-regulation of Akt-1 was not further
increased by administration of MK-2206.
Then, we studied cell growth with the xCELLigence
System in both non-transfected and transfected cells. After
6h from transfection, MK-2206 was added in both nontransfected and transfected cells for an additional 18h

(Fig. 5B and C). Interestingly, the addition of MK-2206
to 6h transfected cells did not decrease their growth that
resulted, on the contrary, higher than the siRNA treated
sample. Therefore, the removal of MK-2206 target by
transfection resulted in a lower drug cytotoxicity when
compared with the drug-untreated transfected samples
(Fig. 5B and C).

related death worldwide [33]. Although patients with
early-stage disease have a good prognosis, there has been
no effective therapy available for those with advanced
disease. Thus, treatment of HCC remains an urgent health
concern [34].
Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
through mutations and/or inactivation of key pathway
components occurs in various malignancies, including
HCC [35]. Several mechanisms may be responsible
for the activation of PI3K/Akt in HCC cells. The high
frequency of the PI3K p110α gene (PIK3CA) mutations
and/or its up-regulation in patients with a shorter survival
is responsible for the Akt hyperactivation found in HCC
with poor prognosis [20]. Moreover, impaired expression
of PTEN could be involved in the regulation of PI3K/Akt
activity. Indeed, activation of Akt signaling and a reduced
expression of PTEN has been reported in 40–60% of
human HCC [14]. Recent studies have demonstrated that
PTEN expression plays a critical role in HCC progression
and patient survival. Patients with a high PTEN expression
had a significantly better overall survival than patients
with a lower expression [36].
On the other hand, activated ERK1/2 and its
downstream effectors were strongly upregulated in the
miscroscopic, residual lesions in the livers of Akt/Ras
mice [13], thus indicating the potential existence of a
functional crosstalk between PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK1/2 pathways along hepatocarcinogenesis, whose
inhibition might be highly beneficial for the treatment of

MK-2206 synergizes with doxorubicin in Mahlavu
cells
We then examined whether MK-2206 could
synergize with the anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin,
since this drug is frequently included in different protocols
to treat HCC. Mahlavu cells were treated with doxorubicin
at a single concentration (0.1 μM) and with MK-2206 at
two different concentrations (0.5 and 1.5 μM) and the
synergistic effects of the combination were monitored after
48h or 72h of treatment using the xCELLigence System
and by analyzing the Cell Index (Fig.6A and B). We
could observe a synergistic effect of the combined drug
treatment in suppressing cell proliferation and viability,
more evident at the higher (1.5 μM) concentration of MK2206 (Fig.6A and B).

DISCUSSION

HCC patients.
Although some preclinical studies have
demonstrated that PI3K/Akt inhibitors such as perifosine,
LY294002 and wortmannin displayed anti-HCC activity,
no studies have been conducted so far at the clinical level.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential
therapeutic activity of the novel oral allosteric Akt
inhibitor, MK-2206. In a recent investigation, the
combination of the multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib
and MK-2206 overcame the resistance of HCC cells
to Sorafenib at clinically achievable concentrations,
suggesting the potential use of this treatment in HCC
patients [37]. Here, we demonstrated that MK-2206, as
a single agent, decreased the growth of HCC cell lines
in a concentration-dependent manner, blocked the cells
in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and induced apoptosis.
In particular, the activity of the drug on cell proliferation
was analyzed through a novel, innovative technology
referred to as xCELLigence System, where proliferation
of cells, as a first step, and the cytotoxicity of the drug as
a second step, were monitored in real-time through gold
microelectrode arrays on a glass substrate in the bottom

of 96 E-Plates, specific for the system. The cytotoxic
activity of MK-2206 was more potent in cell lines with
higher levels of p-Akt1 (Mahlavu, SNU475) than in cells
with lower p-Akt1 levels (PLC, SNU387). This finding
demonstrated the selectivity of the inhibitor.
An interesting observation is that MK-2206 also
induced autophagy in HCC cells, as documented by the
increased expression of lipidated LC3A/B (LC3A/B-II)
in a concentration-dependent manner. The correlation
between autophagy and tumorigenesis has been explored
extensively, but whether autophagy acts as a protumorigenic or anti-tumor player in tumor development
and cancer therapy is still unclear [38, 39].
The process of autophagy is characterized by the
formation of the autophagosome, a double membrane
structure that sequesters the target organelles/proteins and
then fuses with endo/lysosomes, where the content itself
and the autophagosome major component, LC3A/B, are
degraded [40, 41]. Autophagy has been demonstrated
to be required for continued cell growth in pancreatic
cancers [42]. Accumulating evidence demonstrated also
that suppression of the proteins involved in autophagy,
such as Beclin-1 and Atg-5, could cause acceleration of
tumorigenesis [38]. We documented that chloroquine,
an autophagy inhibitor, sensitized Mahlavu cells to the
cytotoxic effects of MK-2206. This finding suggests that
in HCC cells autophagy could have a tumor protecting
role when neoplastic cells are treated with Akt inhibitors.
In this connection, it is worth remembering here that it
has previously been reported that MK-2206 induces
autophagy in human glioma cells and this protected tumor
cells against apoptosis [18]. Therefore, the inclusion of
autophagy inhibitors could be considered in future HCC
therapeutic protocols based on Akt inhibitors. Indeed, a
number of clinical trials are now revealing the promising
role of chloroquine as a novel antitumor drug [43].
In Mahlavu and SNU475 cell lines, MK-2206
dephosphorylated Akt-1 on Ser 473 and its downstream
targets, GSK3-α/β and FoxO3A. However, MK-2206
increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK 1/2, through a
MEK-dependent mechanism, as the hyperphosphorylation
was blocked by the MEK inhibitor, AZD6244. ERK 1/2
hyperphosphorylation acted as a protective mechanism
against MK-2206 cytotoxicity, as the MK-2206/AZD6244
combined treatment was more cytotoxic to Mahlavu cells
than either treatment alone.
To further delineate the inhibition of Akt signaling
as a major molecular target responsible for the effects
of MK-2206 in HCC cells, we down-regulated protein
expression of Akt-1 in Mahlavu cells by siRNA
transfection. The viability of transfected cells with Akt1 down-regulation, was higher than control samples after
MK-2206 treatment, implying that removal of the MK2206 target by transfection could result in a lower drug
cytotoxicity.

Real-time cell growth surveillance by cell
electronic sensing (xCELLigence System)

of HCC are not effective [1]. Considering the very low
response rate to doxorubicin, perhaps the most widely
used traditional chemotherapeutic drug used in HCC
patients [2], it appeared of interest to explore the efficacy
of the combination of chemotherapy with other selective
agents targeted to specific signal transduction effectors.
We demonstrated in this work that MK-2206 was able
to synergize with doxorubicin. Analysis of the results
demonstrated in Mahlavu cells a synergistic effect of the
combined treatment in suppressing cell proliferation.
In conclusion, our findings strongly suggest that
MK-2206, either alone or combined with traditional
chemotherapeutic drugs, could be a valuable compound
for treating HCC patients displaying activation of PI3K/
Akt signaling and who are still facing a very poor
prognosis.

Proliferation was monitored in real-time cell
electronic sensing (xCELLigence System, Roche
Applied Science) through gold microelectrode arrays on
a glass substrate in the bottom of 96 E-Plates, specific
for the system. HCC cells (2,500-20,000 cells/well in
100 μl, depending on the cell growth) were seeded into
16 E-Plates (Roche Applied Science) containing 100 μl
medium/well. After 24h, 100 μl medium was discarded
and replaced with 100 μl of fresh medium for each well.
MK-2206 was added at the indicated concentrations
to 200 μl of medium. In the xCELLigence System the
changes in cell number are detected as modifications in the
measurement of electrical impedance and are represented
as Cell Index (CI). Since the number of cells that have
been seeded is known, the CI is related to the quantitative
measurement of the electrical impedance present in the
well and it displays in plots the changes of cells that
adhere to the conducting metals on the bottom of the
wells. Therefore, CI values increase or decrease in parallel
with cell growth due to the insulating properties of the cell
membrane attached to the bottom of the well. Untreated
cells were used to establish a reference baseline; results
were baseline adjusted and expressed as CI normalized to
the time point of compound administration. CI was used
to determine also the IC50 values of MK-2206.

TX, USA). Stock solutions of MK-2206 and AZD6244
were prepared in DMSO. Doxorubicin was obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Antibody to total
Akt-1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA) while all the other antibodies were from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA), including an
antibody specific for Ser473 p-Akt-1. siRNA to Akt-1 was
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Cell viability analysis
MTT
(3-[4,5-Dimethylthythiazol-2-yl]-2,5Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) assays were performed
to assess the sensitivity of cells to drugs, as previously
described [47-49].

Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed using the MuseTM
Cell Analyzer (Merck Millipore, Milan, Italy). In brief,
after 24h of treatment, cells were harvested, centrifugedat
300 x g for 5 min and washed once with 1X PBS. After
fixing them with 70% ethanol for at least 3h at -20°C, cells
were centrifuged at 300x g for 5 min, washed once with
1X PBS and then 200 μl of Muse TM Cell Cycle reagent
was added to each tube with an incubation of 30 min at
room temperature in the dark. Samples were then analyzed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Moreover, analysis of apoptosis in PLC and
Mahlavu cells was performed by Annexin-V/7-AADAssay using the MuseTM Cell Analyzer. In brief, cells
treated with increasing concentrations of MK-2206 were
harvested by trypsinisation after 4h and 8h of treatment,
and a 100 μl cell suspension was labeled for 20 min in the

Cell culture and Western blot analysis
The HCC cell lines Mahlavu and PLC were
maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with
10% FBS, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 0.1 mM NEA, 100 U/
ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. SNU387,
SNU449 and SNU475 cell lines were maintained in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2
mM L-Glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin. All cells were cultured in a 37°C humidified
incubator and an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Western
Blot analysis was performed by standard methods as
described elsewhere [44-46].

Mahlavu cells were transfected in Opti-MEM®
Reduced Serum Medium (Invitrogen) with 4μg siRNA
Akt-1 in six-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After 6h of transfection, Mahlavu cells were incubated
for an additional 18h with MK-2206 for a total of 24h
of transfection and then harvested for Western blotting
analysis. The same experiment was performed using
xCELLigence, where the cells where plated and
transfected in 16 well xCELLigence plates.

The combination effect and a potential synergy
between MK-2206 and doxorubicin were evaluated with
the xCELLigence System. In brief, after 24h from seeding
in E-Plate, Mahlavu cells were treated with different
concentrations of MK-2206 and doxorubicin, and the
combination effects were evaluated after 48h of treatment
by monitoring the different values of CI.
