Abstract
Camptothecin and its derivatives, topotecan and irinotecan, are speciﬁc topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors
and potent anticancer drugs killing cancer cells by producing replication-associated DNA double-strand
breaks, and the indenoisoquinoline LMP-400 (indotecan) is a novel Top1 inhibitor in clinical trial. To develop
novel drug combinations, we conducted a synthetic lethal siRNA screen using a library that targets nearly
7,000 human genes. Depletion of ATR, the main transducer of replication stress, came as a top candidate gene
for camptothecin synthetic lethality. Validation studies using ATR siRNA and the ATR inhibitor VE-821
conﬁrmed marked antiproliferative synergy with camptothecin and even greater synergy with LMP-400.
Single-cell analyses and DNA ﬁber combing assays showed that VE-821 abrogates the S-phase replication
elongation checkpoint and the replication origin–ﬁring checkpoint induced by camptothecin and LMP-400.
As expected, the combination of Top1 inhibitors with VE-821 inhibited the phosphorylation of ATR and Chk1;
however, it strongly induced gH2AX. In cells treated with the combination, the gH2AX pattern changed over
time from the well-deﬁned Top1-induced damage foci to an intense peripheral and diffuse nuclear staining,
which could be used as response biomarker. Finally, the clinical derivative of VE-821, VX-970, enhanced the
in vivo tumor response to irinotecan without additional toxicity. A key implication of our work is the
mechanistic rationale and proof of principle it provides to evaluate the combination of Top1 inhibitors with
ATR inhibitors in clinical trials. Cancer Res; 74(23); 6968–79. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Topoisomerases are essential enzymes that catalyze the
breaking and rejoining of the phosphodiester backbone to
allow the unwinding and disentanglement of DNA during
replication and transcription. Among them, Top1 produces
transient single-stranded DNA breaks as catalytic intermediates that are referred to as Top1 cleavage complexes

(Top1cc; ref. 1). Anticancer Top1 inhibitors act by slowing
down the reversal of Top1cc and the religation of DNA (2–4).
Persistence of Top1cc leads to collisions with replication
forks and transcription complexes, converting them into
irreversible Top1 covalent complexes and DNA doublestrand breaks, which, if not repaired are lethal. The anticancer activity of Top1 inhibitors is primarily related to
replication damage by replication "run-off" and replicationmediated DNA double-strand breaks (3, 5, 6).
Camptothecin and its derivatives are highly selective inhibitors of Top1, and the water-soluble derivatives, topotecan
and irinotecan, are effective anticancer drugs against a wide
range of tumors. However, they are limited by their chemical
instability, ABCG2- and MDR1-mediated efﬂux, the rapid
reversibility of the Top1cc, and dose-limiting bone marrow
and gastro-intestinal toxicity (3, 5). To overcome these limitations, we have developed a novel class of Top1 inhibitors, the
indenoisoquinolines (2), which are chemically stable, not substrates for the drug efﬂux membrane pumps, and produce
persistent Top1cc (7). LMP-400 (Indotecan; NSC-724998) is one
of two indenoisoquinolines currently in phase I clinical trial.
The broad use of camptothecins and the potential of
LMP-400 as a clinical agent raise the prospect of rational
drug combinations. To address this goal, we conducted a
broad range siRNA-based screening to reveal targets that,

Combinations of Topoisomerase I and ATR Inhibitors

when silenced, improve the efﬁcacy of Top1 inhibitors. Using
camptothecin and an apoptosis-targeted siRNA library, we
recently demonstrated the feasibility of the approach and
identiﬁed the kinase TAK1 (MAP3K7), which is involved in
cancer cell growth and in the NF-kB, p38, JNK pathways, as
a novel synthetic lethal pathway for Top1-mediated DNA
damage (8). In the present study, we extended this approach
to more than 7,000 human genes with four independent
siRNAs per gene, and identiﬁed siRNAs that were synthetically lethal with Top1 poisoning, prioritizing genes that
can be validated with drugs in preclinical development.
We focused on ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related
protein kinase), a major signal transducer of the replication stress–induced DNA damage response (DDR), which
functions in parallel with ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), a major transducer of the DNA double-strand break
responses (9–12).
ATR is activated in response to replication stress (singlestranded DNA associated with replication complexes and
stalled replication forks) induced by UV, hydroxyurea, or
chemotherapeutic drugs such as camptothecins. In turn, ATR
activates the cell-cycle kinase Chk1 by phosphorylation (at
serine 345), leading to a suppression of origin ﬁring and DNA
elongation, and cell-cycle arrest in S/G, which promote repair
and prevent premature mitosis, thereby maintaining genomic
stability (9, 10).
Potent and selective ATR inhibitors are in clinical development (13–17) with the rationale to target cancer cells under
replication stress resulting from oncogene addiction
(14, 18, 19) or chemotherapeutic replication inhibitors such
as Top1 inhibitors or gemcitabine (20–22). In the present study,
we explore the molecular and preclinical rationale for combining Top1 inhibitor with ATR inhibitors.

Materials and Methods

siRNA in RPMI, 10% FBS. Camptothecin (20 nmol/L, EC30)
or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) was added to the entire plate 48 hours
after transfection, and viability (CellTiter Glo; Promega) was
assayed 72 hours later on a PerkinElmer Envision 2104 Multilabel Reader.
The druggable genome screening was conducted using the
Qiagen human druggable genome library version 4.1, which
targets nearly 7,000 human genes with approximately four
siRNAs per gene. Each siRNA is arrayed in an individual well.
Qiagen's AllStars Negative control and Qiagen's AllStars Cell
Death control were incorporated on all screening plates for
normalization and as positive transfection control, respectively. Plates were rejected and rescreened if they exhibited an
assay z0 -factor of less than 0.4 or other apparent defects.
Follow-up dose–response tests were carried under analogous
assay conditions.
To select candidate genes modulating camptothecin activity, the log2 ratio of vehicle-treated cell viability (%siNeg) to
camptothecin -treated cell viability (%siNeg) was calculated for
each siRNA. Redundant siRNA Analysis (RSA; ref. 23) was
performed on the ratios to rank gene candidates in terms of
their ability to sensitize MDA-MB-231 to camptothecin. RSA
rankings can be found in Supplementary Table S1. All screen
data have been deposited on PubChem (AID 743121).
Ingenuity Pathway and STRING (24) analyses were performed to identify enriched pathways and protein–protein
interactions among these 42 candidates. For Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), a core analysis was performed using only
direct relationships and used the approximately 7,000 genes
represented in the screen as background. For STRING, relationships were mined using only experiment- and databasedetermined relationships of at least "medium conﬁdence."
Cytotoxicity
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates 24 hours before drug
addition. After a 72-hour treatment, cell survival was determined using the ATPlite 1step Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).
Luminescence was measured by an Envision 2104 Multilabel
Reader. Synergism was assessed using the CompuSyn Software.

Cell lines, chemicals, and drugs
HT29 and COLO 205 colon and MDA-MD-231 breast
carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI medium with 10%
FBS (Gibco-BRL) at 37 C in 5% CO2. HT29 and MDAMB-231 cells, camptothecin, LMP-400, and VE-821 were
obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program
(DCTD, NCI), where cells were authenticated by short
tandem repeat DNA ﬁngerprinting. COLO 205 colorectal
adenocarcinoma cells were purchased from the ATCC.
HCT116 wild-type and p53 knockout cells were given by
Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University). All the cell lines
were conﬁrmed with the absence of Mycoplasma contamination (MycoAlert; Lonza). VX-970 (VE-822) was produced
by Vertex Pharmaceuticals.

Analyses of EdU incorporation, cell cycle, and apoptosis
HT29 cells were incubated with 50 mmol/L 5-ethynyl-20 deoxyuridine (EdU) for 30 minutes before adding Top1 inhibitors for 1 hour. Cells were harvested 18 hours after Top1
inhibitors. EdU was detected by ﬂow cytometry (Click-iT EdU
Alexa Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay; Invitrogen), and DNA
using propidium iodide (PI). Apoptotic cells were detected 48
hours after Top1 inhibitors using Annexin V/PI costaining
(FITC Annexin V Apoptosis kit; BD Biosciences). Samples were
analyzed on a FACScan ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).

siRNA screening
For transfections, 20 mL of serum-free media containing
Lipofectamine RNAiMax (0.05 mL) was added to wells of
384-well plates (Corning 3570) containing siRNA (0.8 pmol).
Lipid and siRNA were allowed to complex for 45 minutes at
ambient temperature before addition of 600 MDA-MB-231 cells
to yield ﬁnal transfection mixtures containing 20 nmol/L

Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy staining of replication
foci using CldU and IdU
HT29 cells were grown in 4-well chamber slides (NalgeNunc) and labeled with 100 mmol/L chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU)
or iododeoxyuridine (IdU) for 45 minutes. Slides were prepared
(6) and images visualized with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal
microscope.

DNA ﬁber assays
Molecular combing was performed as described (6). Brieﬂy,
at the end of the CldU pulse, trypsinized cells were embedded
in low-melting agarose. After digestion with b-agarase (New
England Biolabs), DNA was combed on silanized surfaces
(Microsurfaces, Inc.), and replicons were detected with antiIdU and anti-CldU antibodies. Images were captured with the
software Attovision using the epiﬂuorescence microscope
Pathway (Becton Dickinson). Signals were measured using
ImageJ (open source from National Cancer Institute, NIH)
with custom-made modiﬁcations.
Immunoblotting
Total cell lysates were electrophoresed on 4% to 20% Trisglycine or 3% to 8% Tris-acetate polyacrylamide gels, and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies against
GAPDH, ATR, and pS345-Chk1 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, gH2AX and pT68-Chk2 from Abcam, and
Top1 from BD Biosciences. Antibody against pT1989-ATR was
generated by the Pharmacodynamics Assay Development and
Implementation Section (PADIS) of the Laboratory of Human
Toxicology and Pharmacology at the National Laboratory for
Cancer Research (Frederick, MD). After incubation with secondary antibody, signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).
IdU and gH2AX staining
After incubation with 100 mmol/L IdU for 75 minutes with or
without drugs for 1 hour, HT29 cells were ﬁxed at different time
intervals with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. Slides were
prepared (6) and images visualized by Zeiss LSM 780 confocal
microscope.
Xenografts
MF1 athymic, nude mice were treated in accordance with the
Animal (Scientiﬁc Procedures) Act and the United Kingdom
Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research Guidelines for the
Welfare of Animals in Experimental Neoplasia. Mice weighing
20 to 30 g (Harlan UK Ltd) were inoculated subcutaneously with
1  107 COLO205 cells in 100 mL of a serum-free media and
Matrigel mixture (1:1). When the tumors reached about 250
mm3, the mice were randomized in groups of 8 animals. VX-970
[VE-822, 60 mg/kg in a solution in 10% Vitamin E Tocopheryl
Polyethylene Glycol Succinate (VitE TPGS)] was administered
by oral gavage on days 0, 1, and 2 of each 4-day cycle. Irinotecan
(20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg in PBS) was administered by intraperitoneal bolus injection on day 0 of each 4-day cycle. The control
group was treated with vehicle (10% VitE TPGS in water) on
days 0, 1, and 2 of each 4-day cycle. A total of 4 treatment cycles
were given. Tumors were measured twice a week by caliper, and
volumes were calculated using the formula (length  width2)/2.
Body weight was assessed twice a week.

Results
RNAi screening identiﬁes ATR as a top synthetic lethal
gene for Top1 inhibitors
To determine pathways and associated drug targets to
improve the use of Top1 inhibitors, we conducted a druggable

6970

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

genome screen targeting nearly 7,000 human genes in MDAMB-231 cells (8). To select candidate genes that modulate
camptothecin activity, the log2 ratio of vehicle-treated to
camptothecin-treated cell viability was calculated for each
siRNA, and RSA (23) was used to rank gene candidates for
their ability to sensitize to camptothecin. RSA identiﬁed 42
candidates with P  0.001 (Supplementary Table S1). IPA on
these top candidates revealed an expected enrichment in
canonical cell cycle and DNA repair–related pathways (Supplementary Table S2), and both IPA and STRING (24) identiﬁed enrichments for known protein–protein interactions
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1). Evasion of apoptosis
represents one of the fundamental hallmarks of cancer and
can be driven by upregulation of prosurvival factors. Accordingly, we found that several antiapoptotic factors ranked
high in the screen. They included BCL2L1 (BCLXL) and the
complex comprising MAP3K7 (TAK1), MAP3K7IP2 (TAB2),
and TRAF6, which is consistent with our prior screen (8).
These results indicated that the screen identiﬁed relevant
genes.
To further investigate top candidate genes, the effects of
siRNAs were examined with camptothecin concentration
responses. Follow-up was performed in two rounds. The
ﬁrst involved testing many of the same sequences from
the primary screen, plus additional siRNAs from the same
vendor (Qiagen). In all, at least four sequences were tested
for 79 of 133 genes scoring P < 0.005 by RSA (Supplementary
Table S3). In the second round, three additional siRNAs were
obtained from a different vendor (Ambion) for 47 of the
candidate genes to further distinguish the most robust hits
and reduce the likelihood of false positives from off-target
effects. Figure 1B lists those with more than half of 7
siRNAs yielding >4-fold sensitization. The corresponding
curves can be found in Supplementary Fig. S2. ATR was
among the most potent and robust targets, and additional
testing showed that depletion of ATR similarly affected
LMP-400 (Fig. 1C). Because of the ongoing development
of clinical ATR and Top1 inhibitors, and our interest in
Top1-mediated DNA replication damage and S-phase
checkpoint regulation (6, 25, 26), the remaining part of our
study focuses on the combination of ATR inhibitors with
camptothecin and LMP-400.
VE-821 potentiates the cytotoxicity of both
camptothecin and LMP-400
VE-821 was chosen for our molecular analyses because of
its well-documented effects on ATR (13, 15, 21). Cells were
exposed to camptothecin or LMP-400 for 1 hour because
Top1 inhibitors are usually administered as short-time
infusions. Yet, they produce extended cell-cycle arrest and
checkpoint responses (6, 26, 27). VE-821 treatments were
started together with the Top1 inhibitors but continued
after Top1 inhibitor removal to maximize the impact of
checkpoint inhibition (6, 25). Three colon carcinoma cell
lines were examined in addition to the MDA-231 breast
cancer cells: HT29 and a pair of isogenic HCT116 wild-type
and p53 knockout cells to study the contribution of p53 to
the potentiation of drug lethality.

Combinations of Topoisomerase I and ATR Inhibitors

Figure 1. Druggable genome
siRNA screen yields robust
candidates whose knockdown
sensitizes MDA-MB-231 cells to
camptothecin (CPT). A, top
candidates are enriched in known
protein–protein interactions as
determined by STRING. A similar
degree of high connectivity was
observed by IPA (Supplementary
Fig. S1). B, testing 7 siRNAs for
select candidates identiﬁed
several genes with the majority of
siRNAs leading to a 4-fold shift
in camptothecin EC50 value.
C, the knockdown of ATR also
sensitized MDA-MB-231 cells to
LMP-400. Analysis was
conducted with two active
siRNAs (Qiagen) tested in B. ATR
siRNAs, n ¼ 3. Negative control
siRNA (siNeg), n ¼ 16. Both
siRNAs reduced ATR transcript
levels by more than 80% as
determined by real-time PCR.
Catalog numbers are listed in the
chart legends along with
calculated EC50s and conﬁdence
intervals (CI).

VE-821 alone had minimal effect on cell viability up to
10 mmol/L (Fig 2). Consistent with the results obtained in
cells depleted for ATR by RNAi (Fig. 1C), VE-821 sensitized
MDA-MB-231 cells to both camptothecin and LMP-400
(Fig. 2A, top and bottom). The impact of the combination
was stronger in HT29 (Fig. 2B) and in TP53-deﬁcient HCT116
cells (Fig. 2D) than in MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells
(Fig. 2C). It was also more pronounced for LMP-400 than
camptothecin. Synergy was evaluated (28) using the CompuSyn software at the noncytotoxic concentration of 1
mmol/L VE-821. The results are illustrated with combination
index values below 1, as observed in all cell lines for both
camptothecin and LMP-400 except for the TP53-proﬁcient
HCT116 cells (Fig. 2E). Because HT-29 cells were used in our
previous cell-cycle checkpoint studies (6, 25–27), we performed the following molecular analyses in HT29 cells using
1 mmol/L concentration for both the Top1 and ATR
inhibitors.
VE-821 abrogates the intra–S-phase checkpoint induced
by camptothecin and LMP-400, and induces apoptosis
Top1 inhibitors alone produced a marked delay in S-phase
progression (6, 7, 26): 18 hours after treatment with camptothecin and LMP-400, cells accumulated in late and mid
S-phase, respectively (Fig. 3A, left). VE-821 abrogated this
S-phase delay, enabling cells to move through the G2–M
checkpoint after camptothecin while accumulating in G2–M
after LMP-400 (Fig. 3A, right). The more pronounced cellcycle effect of LMP-400 is consistent with its more potent
and persistent Top1 inhibition and greater cytotoxicity
(Fig. 2; ref. 7).

www.aacrjournals.org

To further examine the effects of VE-821 on cell-cycle
progression and because Top1 inhibitors selectively target
replicating cells, we followed the cells that were in S-phase
during the Top1 inhibitor treatments using EdU pulse labeling
(6). FACS proﬁles of EdU incorporation versus DNA content
revealed the progression of control cells and VE-821–treated
cells through the cell cycle, indicating their normal progression
through G2–M toward the next S-phase (Fig. 3B, top). As
expected, camptothecin and LMP-400 produced a marked
delay in S-phase progression with cells blocked in G2 without
advancing to the next cell cycle (Fig. 3B, left). The non–EdUlabeled cells (i.e., those that were not in S-phase at the time of
Top1 inhibitor treatment) progressed also very slowly with
more cells in G2 after camptothecin treatment than in the
control cells. In the case of LMP-400, most of the non–EdUlabeled cells were in G2, and only few in G1, indicating that only
few cells were able to initiate a new cell cycle. VE-821 allowed
cell-cycle progression of the cells that had been targeted in Sphase by the Top1 inhibitors (Fig. 3B, right); the cells were more
broadly distributed throughout the cell cycle, with a fraction of
labeled cells having progressed through G2–M and being in Sphase of the next cell cycle. Together, these experiments
demonstrate that VE-821 efﬁciently abrogates the intra–Sphase and G2 checkpoints induced by camptothecin and
LMP-400.
Induction of apoptosis using Annexin V/PI costaining was
also monitored (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the survival experiments (Fig. 2), the combination VE-821 plus Top1 inhibitors
increased the fraction of early apoptotic cells (Annexin V
positive/PI negative; from 4.5% to 26% for camptothecin and
16.6% to 28.7% in the case of LMP-400).

than 0.1 indicate synergy, strong synergy, and very strong synergy, respectively.

Uninhibited DNA synthesis in preexisting replication foci
and in new replication foci in cells treated with Top1
inhibitors and VE-821
Camptothecin activates the Chk1-dependent intra–Sphase checkpoint that inhibits the ﬁring of late replication
origins (6). To examine origin ﬁring, we analyzed DNA
replication foci by sequential pulse labeling with CldU and
IdU (Fig. 4A).
Figure 4B and E shows representative images for untreated and VE-821–treated cells, respectively. After 8 hours (the
time interval between the two pulses), new replication foci
formed, whereas those that were active 8 hours earlier did
not incorporate IdU any longer. As a result, the green (CldU)
and red (IdU) foci generally do not colocalize, demonstrating
cell-cycle progression through S-phase.
In the absence of VE-821, camptothecin- and LMP-400–
treated cells (Fig. 4C and D) showed a pronounced attenuation of IdU foci, demonstrating S-phase checkpoint
with inactivation of late replication origins (6). By contrast,
in the presence of VE-821, IdU foci were restored in spite
of camptothecin or LMP-400 (Fig. 4F and G). Most CldU
and IdU foci remained distinct, indicating initiation of
new origins. Yet, in some cells, some CldU foci colocalized
with IdU foci, suggesting persistence of replication foci
beyond 8 hours. These results demonstrate that VE-821

VE-821 rapidly inhibits the DNA elongation checkpoint
induced by Top1 inhibitors
Together with inhibition of replication origin ﬁring, camptothecin produces a rapid fork elongation response (6).
To elucidate the effect of Top1 inhibitors and VE-821 on
checkpoint control of replication fork progression, DNA
ﬁbers were analyzed to visualize single replicons (6, 29). Cells
were sequentially pulse labeled with IdU and CldU. Top1
inhibitors were added during the CldU pulse, whereas VE-821
was present during both pulses (Fig. 5A). Representative DNA
replication forks are shown in Fig. 5B. Newly synthesized
DNA ﬁbers emanating from replication origins ﬁred before
the IdU pulses were labeled in green. Contiguous with green
tracts, red tracts correspond to DNA synthesized during the
CldU pulse as replication continued.
In cells exposed to camptothecin or LMP-400 without
VE-821, DNA synthesis during the CldU pulse was inhibited,
resulting in short red tracks (Fig. 5B, left; refs. 6, 25). By
contrast, in cells exposed to VE-821, DNA synthesis persisted
during the second pulse (Fig. 5B, right). To quantify the impact
of the combinations of camptothecin or LMP-400 with VE-821
on DNA replication fork progression, we analyzed the ratio of
CldU to IdU pulses (Fig. 5C). In untreated cells or in cells
exposed to VE-821 alone, the ratios were closed to 1 (1.17 and
1.07, respectively), indicating that replication fork velocity was
comparable during each pulse. Camptothecin and LMP
reduced the CldU:IdU ratio to 0.52 and 0.34, respectively. This

Figure 3. S-phase arrest induced by camptothecin (CPT) or LMP-400 is abrogated by VE-821. A, cell-cycle effects were determined by PI staining 17 h

was monitored 17 h after Top1 inhibitor treatment (1 h) by following the cells that were replicating (EdU-labeled) at the time of Top1 inhibitor treatment.
C, effect of VE-821 on apoptotic cells 48 hours after Top1 inhibitors removal. Annexin V/PI double staining was used to monitor apoptosis.

DDR molecular biomarkers induced by VE-281
Because VE-281 directly targets ATR (13, 15) upstream from
Chk1, we determined autophosphorylation of ATR on threonine 1989, a DNA damage activation site (30, 31), and Chk1
phosphorylation on serine 345, which is mediated by ATR. We
also determined histone H2AX phosphorylation on serine 139
(gH2AX), a validated pharmacodynamic biomarker for DNA
damage and apoptosis (32–34).
Camptothecin and LMP-400 quickly induced the rapid
phosphorylation of Chk1, Chk2, and H2AX, whereas phosphorylation of ATR was delayed and best detectable after
drug removal. Chk1 and ATR remained phosphorylated for
18 hours, consistent with the persistent checkpoint activation for hours after Top1 inhibitor removal (6, 27). VE-821
inhibited the phosphorylation of both ATR and Chk1 without reducing Chk2 phosphorylation, conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of VE-821 for ATR. Notably, VE-821 strongly induced
gH2AX over time (Fig. 6B and C). LMP-400 showed more
pronounced effects than camptothecin, consistent with the
enhanced Top1 inhibitory potency of LMP-400 (ref. 7; Figs. 2
and 3).

DNA replication foci (labeled by short IdU pulses), and
the possible induction of gH2AX pan-staining, as a hallmark of ATR-dependent replication stress (14, 18) or apoptosis (34).
Consistent with previous results (6, 7), in the absence of
VE-821, camptothecin- and LMP-400–induced gH2AX foci
mostly colocalized with DNA replication foci (Fig. 6D, left
plots, second and ﬁfth rows; E, right, top row). At the
1-hour treatment time, VE-821 had no signiﬁcant impact on
camptothecin- or LMP-400–induced gH2AX foci intensity and
distribution (Fig. 6D and E).
Next, we examined the gH2AX response at later times in the
presence and absence of VE-821. Consistent with the Western
blotting results (Fig. 6B and C), in the absence of VE-821,
camptothecin-induced gH2AX foci decreased over time,
whereas LMP-400–induced gH2AX foci were more persistent.
Notably, in the presence of VE-821, the gH2AX pattern changed. Instead of well-deﬁned foci, gH2AX staining became
diffuse and appeared like a ring. This "gH2AX ring" increased
over time (Fig. 6D, right). Figure 6E shows detailed images of a
typical cell following LMP-400 þ VE-821 cotreatment, demonstrating that gH2AX accumulates at the periphery of
enlarged nuclei without colocalization with the replication
foci that were damaged by Top1 inhibitors. Similar results were
obtained with camptothecin, although with a lesser intensity.
Together, these results demonstrate that ATR inhibition by VE821 produces intense gH2AX pan-staining.

VE-821 markedly enhances gH2AX
Next, we focused on gH2AX using single-cell analyses
(6) to determine the relationship between the gH2AX and

In vivo potentiation of irinotecan by VX-970
To assess the effect of ATR inhibition on tumor responses
to Top1 inhibitors, we used VX-970 (VE-822), which is a close

replication fork slowdown was abrogated by VE-821, as the
ratio CldU:IdU shifted back to 0.98 and 1.02 for the combinations of VE-821 with camptothecin or LMP-400, respectively.
These results demonstrate that VE-821 abrogates the DNA
elongation checkpoint.

effective when dosed in combination with 20 mg/kg irinotecan, where substantial tumor regression was observed

We identiﬁed signiﬁcant candidate genes involved in apoptosis.
BCL2L1, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl2 family, also known
as BCLXL, whose expression is increased in various cancers (35,
36) and which inhibits proapoptotic factors such as BAX and BAK
(36), scored as a top sensitizer. Small-molecule inhibitors of
BCL2/BCL-XL such as Obatoclax or ABT-737 have been used in
monotherapy or in combination with various agents notably Top
inhibitors (37, 38). Depletion of TRAF6, MAP3K7, and MAP3K7IP2, three genes involved in NF-kB activation and in a kinase
complex comprising TAK1 (MAP3K7), TAB1, TAB2 (MAP3K7IP2), and TRAF6 (39), also sensitized to camptothecin. We
also found RNF31 (HOIP), which activates the NF-kB pathway
through the polyubiquitylation of NEMO (NF-kB essential
modulator, IKKg) in the canonical IKK complex (40). These
results are consistent with a previous screen (8).
The DNA damage sensing kinase, ATR, which was also
among the top candidates, was chosen for further analyses

as ATR inhibitors are entering clinical trials. After recognition of stalled replication forks, ATR regulates the intra–Sphase checkpoint by stabilizing replication forks, regulating
cell cycle and DNA damage repair (9, 10). siRNA of three ATR
targets Chk1, BRCA1, and UPF1 (41) also scored as top
candidates, as did the PPP2R1A subunit of the protein
phosphatase PP2A, which is involved in the regulation of
the cell-cycle checkpoints (42).
As the primary cytotoxic mechanism of Top1 inhibitors in
dividing cells is by generation of replication-fork collisions that
convert Top1cc into irreversible DNA lesions (5), ATR and its
downstream target, Chk1, are crucial factors for the DNA
damage response to Top1 inhibitors (5, 6, 25). Accordingly,
inhibition of ATR by siRNA or VE-821 and its clinical derivative,
VX-970, sensitized tumor cells to Top1 inhibitors. Loss of p53
inﬂuenced cell sensitivity to the combination of ATR and Top1
inhibitors as demonstrated in an isogenic system (14–16, 43).

However, cellular sensitivity did not strongly correlate with
TP53 mutational status in heterogeneous cell panels (16). Our
results are in agreement with recent reports describing the
sensitization of cancer cells to combinations of VE-821 with
multiple agents including camptothecin, topotecan, etoposide,
gemcitabine, cisplatin, and ionizing radiation (15, 20, 21).
Moreover, similarly to the disruption of Chk1 by UCN-01,
CHIR-24, and AZD7762 (6, 25, 26, 44, 45), disruption of ATR
by VE-821 abrogated the cell-cycle arrest induced by camptothecin and LMP-400. The addition of VE-821 forced progres-

www.aacrjournals.org

sion through S-phase and G2–M for a proportion of the cells
exposed to camptothecin, whereas the LMP-400–treated cells
progressed through S-phase but were still not able to efﬁciently
complete mitosis.
Single-cell analyses of DNA replication foci using CldU:IdU
sequential pulses revealed that the combination of VE-821 with
Top1 inhibitors induced unscheduled DNA synthesis and
allowed late-replicating chromosomal domains to initiate
replication. Because each replication focus in immunohistochemistry experiments contains multiple origins, we used
molecular combing (DNA ﬁber assays) to visualize single
replicons (6, 29) and measure the impact of ATR on the
elongation of damaged replicons. We previously demonstrated
that camptothecin and LMP-400 inhibit DNA elongation
(6, 25), but here, using comparable conditions, we show that
LMP-400 is a more potent inhibitor of DNA elongation than
camptothecin. Yet, VE-821 acted very rapidly to inhibit this
checkpoint response elicited by camptothecin or LMP-400.
DNA double-strand breaks induced by Top1 inhibitors are
mediated both by replication or transcription collisions (5, 46).
A recent study describing a method to quantify the spatial
distance between gH2AX foci and replication factories using
confocal microscopy estimated a close relationship between
gH2AX foci and replication factories (47). gH2AX foci induced
by LMP-400 were more persistent than those induced by
camptothecin, which is consistent with the chemical stability
and persistence of LMP-400–induced Top1cc after drug
removal (7). As shown by immunoblotting, inhibition of ATR
by VE-821 led to an accumulation of gH2AX induced by Top1
inhibitors, whereas VE-821 by itself did not induce gH2AX.
Previous reports (15, 20), (21, 48) are in agreement with our
ﬁndings showing phosphorylation of H2AX on Ser139 (gH2AX)
by ATM and/or DNA-PK after stalled replication, especially in
the absence of ATR (14, 49). Furthermore, VE-821 has been
shown to inhibit homologous recombination repair, as evidenced by a decrease in RAD51 foci (21).
A notable ﬁnding of the present study is the induction of
intense "gH2AX rings" in cells cotreated with Top1 inhibitors
and VE-821, starting a few hours after Top1 inhibitors and
followed by a pan-staining that persisted until the formation
of apoptotic bodies. Yet, this diffuse staining starting at the
nuclear periphery is not initially associated with classical
apoptotic markers. Rather, it may be related to the diffuse
nuclear gH2AX staining induced by ATR inhibition, which
was used as an endpoint in a high-throughput cell-based
screen to identify ATR inhibitors (14). From a pharmacodynamic perspective, the intense gH2AX diffuse nuclear
staining might be useful to evaluate combination therapy
with Top1 and ATR inhibitors, and could be tested as a
response biomarker in tumor samples, circulating tumor
cells and surrogate tissues, such as plucked hairs (50). On the
basis of our study, additional pharmacodynamic biomarkers
for ATR inhibitors could be inhibition of Chk1 phosphorylation on Ser345 (21, 48) and inhibition of ATR autophosphorylation on threonine 1989.
Beyond its molecular and mechanistic insights, our study
provides the proof of concept that ATR inhibitors are worthy of
consideration for clinical trials in combination with Top1

inhibitors. Indeed, the clinical derivative of VE-821, VX-970
(16), showed remarkable synergism in combination with irinotecan, a widely used Top1 inhibitor. Further studies are
warranted to examine VX-970 and other ATR inhibitors in
combination with irinotecan, topotecan, or the non-camptothecin indenoisoquinolines, such as LMP-400 and LMP776 (2).
