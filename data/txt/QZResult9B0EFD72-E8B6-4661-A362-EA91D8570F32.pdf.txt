Combined Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer with Mithramycin
A and Tolfenamic Acid Promotes Sp1 Degradation and
Synergistic Antitumor Activity—Letter
Ting-Chao Chou

I read with interest the recent article by Jia and colleagues
(1), which presents in Figure 5B a plot for drug combination
synergy determination by using the x-axis with "Proportion
Surviving (E)" and the y-axis with "Interaction Index." This plot
is very similar in form to the Fa–CI plot introduced by Chou
and Talalay (2), which has been cited in more than 2,000
articles where the x-axis is noted as "Fraction Affected (Fa)"
(e.g., fraction inhibited or fraction killed) and the y-axis as
"Combination Index (CI)." One cannot be convinced that
fractional survival equals fraction kill by simple logic. I believe
it is important to straighten out this contradiction, because
drug combination or synergy determination (2–6) is widely
used for cancer, AIDS, and other diseases. In the Jia article (1),
the E–Interaction Index plot is based on a theoretical article
by Lee and colleagues (7), using the probabilistic statistical
approach rather than the deterministic mass-action law
approach. I have serious reservations for its feasibility and
question the reason why the new method (7) contradicts the

widely used, preexisting CI method (2–3). On examining the
Lee article (7), I have noticed that its Eqs. 3 to 8 and 12 to 14
were directly taken from Chou's and Chou–Talalay's major
equations since 1973 (2–6) by substituting existing symbols
with different symbols. The substitution of symbols by itself
does not constitute a "derivation." In addition, by comparing
Eqs. 3 and 4, then "E „ E" and it is unclear where Eq. 2 "Emax"
came from. Arbitrarily, alternating Chou–Talalay's equation
with "E" in Eq. 4 is not what the original had intended.
My concerns focus on the following issues. First, is drug
combination synergy quantification a mass-action law issue
or a statistical issue? If the latter is the case, then how can
the probabilistic/statistical approach be used to derive the
deterministic/pharmacodynamic equations or algorithms
for a quantitative diagnostic plot? Also, why is the statistical
approach allowed to contradict the equations/algorithms
derived from the mass-action law? Second, the quantification of synergism (CI < 1), additive effect (CI ¼ 1), and
antagonism (CI > 1) were mathematically defined by Chou
and Talalay in 1984 (2) following the systematic derivation of
more than 300 mechanism specific equations (2–4), yet Lee
and colleagues (7) attributed these definitions to Loewe
without reference.
