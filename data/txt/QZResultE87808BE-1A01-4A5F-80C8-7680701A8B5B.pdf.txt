Abstract
Salinomycin has been used as treatment for malignant tumors in a small number
of humans, causing far less side effects than standard chemotherapy. Several studies
show that Salinomycin targets cancer-initiating cells (cancer stem cells, or CSC)
resistant to conventional therapies. Numerous studies show that Salinomycin not
only reduces tumor volume, but also decreases tumor recurrence when used as an
adjuvant to standard treatments. In this study we show that starvation triggered
different stress responses in cancer cells and primary normal cells, which further
improved the preferential targeting of cancer cells by Salinomycin. Our in vitro
studies further demonstrate that the combined use of 2-Fluoro 2-deoxy D-glucose, or
2-deoxy D-glucose with Salinomycin is lethal in cancer cells while the use of Oxamate
does not improve cell death-inducing properties of Salinomycin. Furthermore, we
show that treatment of cancer cells with Salinomycin under starvation conditions
not only increases the apoptotic caspase activity, but also diminishes the protective
autophagy normally triggered by the treatment with Salinomycin alone. Thus, this
study underlines the potential use of Salinomycin as a cancer treatment, possibly
in combination with short-term starvation or starvation-mimicking pharmacologic
intervention.

Introduction

preferential targeting [1].
Even though current treatment procedures are able to
effectively target the bulk of the tumor, cancer recurrence
and metastasis formation are major reasons leading to
therapy failure. Studies over the last decade show that
the drug-resistant cancer initiating cells (cancer stem
cells, CSC) have similar characteristics to stem cells as
far as self-renewal and to some extent also differentiation
capacities [2-4]. In 2009, Gupta and colleagues screened
about 16000 compounds in the quest to identify molecules

Initially proposed in 1930’s, Warburg effect or
the dependence of cancer cells on aerobic glycolysis, is
considered the ‘Achilles heel’ of cancer [1]. The addiction
of cancer cells to accumulate the cellular mass increases
uptake of glucose as opposed to normal cells that undergo
quiescence/senescence under nutrient deprivation, even
in the presence of growth factors. This adoption of
proliferative cancer cells for survival can be exploited for

in figure 1AB, Salinomycin kills the tongue and larynx
cancer cell lines LK0412 and LK0923 respectively, in a
concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, LK0923
cells that have a high percentage of cells expressing CD44
show a higher toxicity by Salinomycin than LK0412.
However, normal oral keratinocytes (NOK) did not show
any significant cell death after 24h of treatment with 1µM
and 10µM Salinomycin (Fig. 1C). We further studied the
reversibility of cell death and effect on cell proliferation
by Salinomycin treatment. MTT assay results showed that
LK0412 cells treated with 10µM Salinomycin for 24h,
after which the medium was replaced with Salinomycinfree media for another 48h, did not show increase in cell
proliferation but instead further decrease in cells viability
(Fig. 1D). Such changes may indicate Salinomycin’s
preferential toxicity towards residual CSC. Following-up
these results, we conducted ‘wound-healing’ assay among
both cancer cells (LK0412) and NOK. Cancer cells,
treated with 1µM Salinomycin, showed partial recovery
during the 48h post-treatment period after media have
been changed. However when 10µM Salinomycin was
applied, no signs of recovery could be observed in cancer
cells (Fig. 1E). In contrast, NOK cells showed recovery
at both concentrations (1µM and 10µM), even signs of
hypertrophy at 1µM concentration of Salinomycin (Fig.
1E).

that are preferentially toxic to CSC. The screen identified,
an antibiotic with K+-ionophore properties Salinomycin,
which has been used for decades in animal farming for
both increasing nutrient absorption and treatment for
parasitic infections (e.g. coccidiosis) [5].
Consistent with these findings, the effective
targeting of CSC by Salinomycin in several malignancies
including breast-, prostrate-, brain-, blood-, liver-,
pancreatic-, and lung cancers was further established [611]. Salinomycin kills cancer cells by a mixed apoptotic
and autophagic form of cell death, while the latter one is
initially induced as a protective mechanism [9, 12-14].
So far, lethal toxicity of Salinomycin to humans was not
reported. One case of accidental high dose exposure to
Salinomycin of a farm-worker has been documented [15].
Using in vitro-studies, Boehmerle and colleagues showed
that Salinomycin is toxic to normal neuronal cells (murine
dorsal root ganglion neurons, toxicity at 1µM, cell viability
~25%, in vitro-experiment), and thus is expected to cause
mild to severe neuropathies [16]. More recently, the work
from the same group, using mouse models, show that a
combination of Salinomycin (5mg/kg daily injection),
with inhibition of mitochondrial Na+/K+ exchanger was
able to show no such neuronal toxicity, without altering
the cancer cell cytotoxicity [17]. Furthermore, partially
successful pilot study in humans showed minor secondary
symptoms while causing the regression of metastatic
tumor [6]. Thus, the efficacy of Salinomycin will likely
be further clinically tested among wide range of cancer
patients [6].
Salinomycin’s ability to specifically kill slowly
proliferating cancer stem-like cells more robustly than the
differentiated cancer cells, even at lower concentrations,
lead to studies using commonly used chemotherapeutic
agents in combination with Salinomycin [6, 18, 19].
We have previously observed that salimomycin caused
mitochondrial dysfunction, decrease of cellular ATP, and
induction of autophagy [9, 14]. Thus, following on our
previous findings, in this study, we tested the response
of normal- and cancer cells under starvation conditions
(natural autophagy inducer). We studied Salinomycin’s
toxicity under glucose starvation, or under competitive
inhibition of glycolytic pathway (pharmacological
triggered starvation-like conditions), as well as under
hypoxia (natural inhibition of phosphorylative oxiation).

Glucose
starvation
and
Salinomycin
synergistically kill cancer cells while protecting
normal, primary cells
To further enhance Salinomycin induced toxicity
among cancer cells along with rendering protection to
the primary cells we looked if the ‘Warburg effect’dependent cancer cell behavior could affect Salinomycin’s
preferential toxicity towards cancer cells. When treated
with Salinomycin under the conditions of glucose
starvation and 1% FBS, Salinomycin induced cell death
increased three-fold in PC3 cancer cells (Fig. 2A).
However primary human fibroblasts showed increased
cell survival under the same conditions (Fig. 2A). We have
tested glucose levels up to 0.75mg/ml, as such levels may
be achieved in patient’s tissues upon starvation. Glucose
analogues 2DG and 2FDG employed in combination
with Salinomycin (pharmacologically-induced glucose
starvation), similarly increased Salinomycin’s toxicity
in PC3 cells, but they were also partially toxic towards
normal primary fibroblasts (Fig. 2B).
Since, lack of glucose or its competitive inhibitors
(2DG and 2FDG) attenuates glycolysis and thus inhibiting
the main source of energy among cancer cells, we next
checked how the inhibition of conversion of pyruvate
to lactate, using sodium oxamate, affects salinomycin’s
toxicity. Surprisingly, the inhibition of the conversion
of pyruvate to lactate by sodium oxamate, in PC3 cells,

under the same conditions. (B) Glucose-starved was pharmacologically simulated by using competitive glucose transport inhibitors 2FDG

concentration, and after 72h (Fig. 2C). So, we further
followed the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation
with dichloroacetate (DCA) that activates pyruvate
dehydrogenase by inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase. PC3 cells that are pretreated with 5mM DCA for 1
h and then treated with salinomycin showed increased cell
death compared to individual treatments of 5mM DCA and

both at 1µM and 10µM concentrations. Interestingly,
combination of 1µM Salinomycin with 10µM Triciribine
caused similar level of toxicity in PC3 cells as 10µM
Salinomycin alone.

Glucose starvation activates caspase-dependent
form of cell death (apoptosis) by Salinomycin
In our initial experiments we have used MTT assay,
which only assesses cell survival, cell proliferation, but
cannot distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis. To
assess the form of cell death initiated by Salinomycin
under tested experimental conditions, we have employed
the flow-cytometry-based Po-Pro/7-AAD assay. High
Po-Pro staining is indicative for apoptosis, whereas high
7-AAD signal indicates compromised cell membranes
and necrosis; also late apoptotic cells stain with for both
dyes. Under glucose starvation, and in the presence of
Salinomycin, dying cells stained with both Po-Pro and
7-AAD, thus indicating apoptosis induction under such
experimental conditions (Fig. 5A). To further elucidate
the molecular mechanism of cell death under combined
starvation and Salinomycin treatment, we checked for
signs of executioner-caspase-3 (or -7) activity by using
the cleavage of PARP1 as indicator (Fig. 5B). Indeed,
Salinomycin treatments amplified glucose starvationtriggered PARP1-cleavage. To gain more insight into
the molecular mechanism of cell death, under tested
experimental conditions, we directly measured the activity
of caspases-3, -8, and -9 by flow cytometry. Combination
of glucose starvation and Salinomycin potentiated the
activation of all three caspases tested, thus confirming that
the combination of starvation and Salinomycin induces
caspase-dependent cell death (Fig. 5CD).

Hypoxia promotes Salinomycin-induced cell death
CSCs survive well under hypoxic conditions found
within hypo-perfused parts of a tumor. Furthermore,
hypoxic conditions, and decreased drug-bioavailability
promote drug resistance, thus we have tested how hypoxic
conditions affect Salinomycin’s toxicity. As shown in
figure 3A and 3B, Salinomycin efficiently kills both
LKO412 and PC3 cells under hypoxic conditions. We have
next tested how glucose starvation affects Salinomycin’s
toxicity under hypoxic conditions. As shown in figure 3B,
Salinomycin triggered cell death in PC3 cells, also under
low glucose conditions. A repetition of experiments in the
presence of glucose analogue 2FDG, produced comparable
effects among cancer cells, within 24h of treatment (Fig.
3C). The tests were performed under both 10% and 1%
FBS concentrations to probe different conditions within
tumor.

Glucose starvation inhibits Salinomycin induced
autophagy
Our earlier studies show that cells respond to
Salinomycin treatment with autophagy, as a cell survival
mechanism. However to our surprise, under glucose
starvation conditions, Salinomycin treatment did not
show increased LC3II accumulation but rather showed
dramatic decrease, and thus implying a marked decrease
in autophagy among extremely stressed cells (Fig. 4A,
and Suppl. Fig. 1). Akt signaling increases if nutritents are
readily available whereas starvation downregulates Aktactivity and induces autophagy. Thus, we mimicked this
aspect of starvation-related event using Akt inhibitor, and
studied the effect of Salinomycin under Akt compromised
conditions. As shown in figure 4B treatment of 1µM
Salinomycin in the cells pre-treated with the Akt inhibitor
Triciribine, triggered increased accumulation of the
autophagic marker LC3II. However, under the same
conditions in the presence of 10µM Salinomycin we
did not observe any change in LC3II levels compared
to Salinomycin treatment alone (Fig. 4B). Similar
observations were made using immuno-cytochemistry
and confocal microscopy (Fig. 4C). We next checked how
Triciribine affects Salinomycin’s toxicity. As shown in
figure 4D, Triciribine potentiated Salinomycin’s toxicity,

Discussion
Salinomycin gained substantial attention when it
was identified as a drug preferentially killing breast cancer
cells exhibiting stemness characteristics [5]. Salinomycin
induced robust cell death in E-cadherin-negative cells
(characteristic typical for metastasis-forming cells) as
compared to the respective control counterparts [5].
Hence, Salinomycin’s anticancer properties have been
evaluated in combination with conventional anticancer
drugs. Interestingly, Salinomycin kills Doxorubicin-,
Cisplatin-, Gemcitabine-, Temozolamide-, Tratsuzumaband Imatinib-resistant cells, and counteracts tumor
recurrence in in vitro as well as animal models [6, 18, 2123]. Interestingly, in this study, we show that LK0923 cells
that express higher level of CD44 than LK0412 cells are
more susceptible to Salinomycin (Fig. 1AB) [24].
Classical radio- or chemotherapy leads to the
selection of the therapy-resistant clones that cause the
recurrence of malignant disease [25, 26]. Our study,

that Salinomycin treatment specifically inhibits the
proliferation of cancer cells, following treatment, without
the mergence of clones that could repopulate the killed
cells, or the “scratch area”. Interestingly, no such inhibition
of proliferation was observed among corresponding
primary NOK, even though we occasionally observed

an increase in cell size. Hence, the data indicates that
Salinomycin preferentially targets CSC without causing
major alteration to the primary cells.
Another factor affecting the action of anticancer
drugs is the tumor microenvironment [3]. Parts of
tumor may be deprived of oxygen (hypoxia) along with
accumulation of metabolites of glycolysis that decrease

the pH and may influence pharmaco-kinetics of drugs.
Our data indicate that both hypoxia and starvation
conditions amplify Salinomycin’s action. Salinomycin has
been killing cancer cells more efficiently under hypoxic
conditions rather than normoxic conditions. Drawing
inspiration from previous work on differential stress
response (DSR) by normal primary and cancer cells, we
tested Salinomycin’s toxicity under low glucose and low
serum exposure at levels achievable upon starvation [27,
28]. Salinomycin’s toxicity was strongly potentiated in
cancer cells, at glucose levels achievable by starvation
(0.75 g/L), and under low serum supply (1% FBS), while
primary human fibroblasts were resistant to Salinomycin.
Our previous studies show that, among other effects,
Salinomycin triggers cell death through damage to
mitochondria leading to decrease of cellular ATP level
[9, 14]. Thus, when Salinomycin acts under low glucose
level (the primary energy source for cancer cells), its
toxicity towards cancer cells will be strongly amplified.
Importantly, increased Salinomycin’s specificity towards
cancer cells under starvation condition was further
enhanced under hypoxia. Similarly, glucose starvation
mimicked by using glucose analogues that cannot enter
glycolysis pathway, also potentiated Salinomycin’s
toxicity both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions,
irrespective of serum content (Fig. 3). However,
Salinomycin in the presence of glucose analogues was
partially toxic towards normal primary fibroblasts (Fig.
2B). The above experiments show that Salinomycin
is more effective under conditions mimicking intratumor environment, and that natural starvation, rather
than pharmacologic inhibition of glucose uptake, would
be potentially more favorable conditions to potentiate
therapeutic effect of Salinomycin.
While combination of treatment with glucose
analogues (2DG, 2FDG) potentiated Salinomycin’s
toxicity, co-treatment with sodium oxamate that inhibits
formation of Lactate (late stage of anaerobic glycolysis in
human cells) did not. This observation further underlines
the dependence of cancer cells on glycolysis-derived
ATP. Our further studies using DCA, which inhibits
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase resulting in the activation
of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that
catalyzed the conversion of pyruvate formed at the end
of glycolysis stem to acetyl-CoA molecules that enter
TCA cycle, in combination with salinomycin show
an increase in cell death. These results suggest that the
promotion of oxidative phosphorylation further potentiates
salinomycin induced cell death. DCA is previously shown
to initiate mitochondrial dependence of cancer cells for
ATP production through normalization of dysfunctional
mitochondria and there by activating intrinsic cell death
pathway in cancer cells [29, 30]. On the other hand,
salinomycin being an ionophore with specificity for
K+ ions promote hyperpolarization of mitochondria or
erythrocytes but usage of higher concentrations show no
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

such specificity resulting in net depolarization [31, 32].
These effects on mitochondrial polarity leading to altered
metabolic dependence of cancer cells could be the reason
for additive cell death effect of DCA and salinomycin
among cancer cells.
We have previously shown that Salinomycin triggers
cell death through interference with mitochondrial ATP
production that strongly induces protective autophagy.
Consequently, the metabolic disturbances trigger caspase
activity and apoptotic cell death [9, 14]. Consistently
with the results reported by us, and by other labs [6, 9],
starvation conditions, which may lower ATP-level, in
combination with Salinomycin, trigger caspase-3, -8 and
-9 activity and apoptotic cell death. More over salinomycin
is shown to activate the AMP activated protein kinase
(AMPK) that triggers autophagy and similarly starvation
conditions or the mimicking conditions promote AMPK
activity [33, 34]. This synergistic activation of AMPK
activity by salinomycin as well as starvation conditions
could cause the inhibition of cell proliferation and promote
cell death.
The activation of autophagy by Salinomycin
modulates its toxicity [9, 35]. We have also shown that
serum starvation potentiates Salinomycin’s toxicity. Serum
starvation also affects the pro-survival Akt-kinase activity.
We next tested how triciribine, the inhibitor of pan-Aktkinases, affects Salinomycin’s toxicity. Triciribine strongly
potentiated Salinomycin’s toxicity, which confirms our
previous results that the decrease of pro-survival signals
(serum starvation) potentiates Salinomycin’s toxicity.
In conclusion, we show that hypoxic, low-glucose,
low-nutrient and growth factor conditions found within
hypo-perfused tumor, actually potentiate Salinomycin’s
toxicity, and increase its preferential anticancer activity.
While starvation, that amplifies selective antitumor activity
of Salinomycin, could be pharmacologically mimicked by
the application of glucose analogues (2DG, 2FDG), likely
ordinary fasting is a clinically-safer method to potentiate
Salinomycin’s action, and increase its therapeutic window.
It would be interesting to test salinomycin in combination
with biologics that selectively kill cancer cells, like i.e.
apoptins [36-38], to see possible synergy effects.

and NOK (Normal Oral Keratinocytes) were cultured
in Keratinocyte-SFM (GIBCO, Invitrogen Corporation,
Paisley, UK) supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin 50
IU/ml, streptomycin 50 µg/ml) [39].

For Western blot analysis collected cell lysates were
assessed for protein concentration using Bradford assay
and further handled as described previously [37]. 20µg of
protein was loaded per gel-well.

Materials and reagents

Confocal microscopy

Salinomycin, 2DG, 2FDG and Saponin, were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved in their
respective buffers as per required concentrations.
Antibodies were obtained from the following sources:
Rabbit-anti-LC3b (Sigma Aldrich), murine anti-Actin
(Abcam) Rabbit anti-PARP1 cleaved subunit antibody
(Millipore) . Secondary antibodies anti-rabbit HRPconjugate and anti-mouse HRP-conjugates were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich.

Before imaging using confocal microscope
(Zeiss), cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4%
paraformaldehyde and methanol, respectively. Cells
were then stained for LC3, using anti-LC3b antibody
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, overnight in incubation
buffer (0.1% Saponin and 5% FBS in PBS). Next day,
cells were washed with incubation buffer (3 times, 5 min
each wash) and were incubated with alexa-488 conjugated
anti-Rabbit antibody (Life Technologies Ltd) for 1h. The
cells were washed and mounted before imaging. A detailed
description of staining procedure was published previously
[36, 42].

Cell death and cell proliferation assays
MTT assay was conducted to assess cell survival
and cell proliferation as described in our earlier studies
[9, 40]. 10,000 cells plated in each well of a 96 well plate
24h prior to experimental treatments. After mentioned
experimental treatments, cells were incubated with MTT
solution for 4h, the formazan crystals were dissolved in
DMSO:Ethanol (1:1 ratio), and the readings were obtained
using a spectrophotometer as described previously [9]. For
differential stress response studies, cells were grown to
a confluence (48h), then the media were replaced with
low glucose and/or FBS contents-media, for 6h and
subsequently treated with Salinomycin for 24h before
harvesting for analysis.

Wound healing assay
A straight line (wound) was made in between the
80% confluent cells grown in a 6-well plate with a sterile
pipette tip and treated with Salinomycin for respective
time periods. Images were taken after 48h using a JuLi
Smart Fluorescence cell Imager in the bright field.

Statistics

Assessment of cell death and caspase activity by
flow cytometry

All the statistics (one way ANOVA, and two way
ANOVA) were conducted using Prism (version 6.0b) and
SPSS (IBM version 20) softwares. All the experiments
were represented as means of a minimum of 3 independent
experiments unless otherwise mentioned. A p value of less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, unless
mentioned otherwise.

Cells were plated in a 6 well plate at 150,000 cells/
well and were cultured to full confluence (48h) prior
to treatment procedures, as indicated in the respective
experimental setup. After 24h of treatment, under various
conditions of glucose and serum levels, with or without
the presence of Salinomycin, the cells were trypsinized,
centrifuged and resuspended in 500µl of PBS. The
cells were then stained with Po-Pro and 7AAD (Life
technologies Ltd.) by incubating on ice for 30 min, and
were measured by flow cytometry as described previously
[9]. To assess the activity of caspase-3, -8 and -9, the cells
were collected in a similar way as for Po-Pro and 7AAD
assay, and were incubated with FAM-FLICA caspase-3,
FAM-FLICA caspase-8, and SR-FLICA caspase-9
substrates (ImmunoChemistry Technologies) for 30 min,
on ice in individual aliquots. The caspase activities were
then measured by flow cytometry, as described in detail
previously [9, 41].
