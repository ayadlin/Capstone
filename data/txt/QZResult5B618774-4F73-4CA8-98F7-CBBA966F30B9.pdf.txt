Implications for Therapy

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease; gene expression analyses recently identified 6 distinct TNBC subtypes, each of which displays a unique biology. Exploring novel approaches for the treatment of these subtypes is critical, especially
because the median survival for women with metastatic TNBC is less than 12 months, and virtually all women with metastatic TNBC
ultimately will die of their disease despite systemic therapy. To date, not a single targeted therapy has been approved for the treatment of TNBC, and cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard treatment. In this review, the authors discuss recent developments
in subtyping TNBC and the current and upcoming therapeutic strategies being explored in an attempt to target TNBC. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
The term triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is used to identify the approximately 15% of breast cancers that lack expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and do not exhibit amplification of the human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. TNBCs are a heterogeneous group of tumors with 1 common feature: a distinctly
aggressive nature with higher rates of relapse and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. TNBCs more frequently affect younger patients and are more prevalent in African American
women, generally of a higher grade, and associated with breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA) gene mutations.1,2 The
median survival for women with metastatic TNBC is less than 1 year, and almost all die of their disease despite aggressive
and toxic systemic chemotherapy.1
The benefits of targeted therapies, as evidenced by improving survival rates for patients with ER-positive/PR-positive
and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-amplified breast cancers, have eluded patients with TNBC
because of the absence of well defined molecular targets. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option
for TNBC. Although some patients respond, the treatment is toxic, and a large percentage treated in the early stage eventually relapse. In the metastatic setting, after 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy, meaningful responses are rare, and all patients
eventually die from their disease.
The identification of molecular targets will be critical to improving survival in patients with TNBC. A major obstacle
to identifying actionable targets in TNBC is the vast disease heterogeneity—both intertumor and intratumor—and years
of study have failed to demonstrate a single unifying alteration that is targetable in TNBC. There is clearly a major need to
better understand the molecular basis of TNBC and to develop effective therapeutic strategies against it. In this review, we
discuss the recent discoveries that have furthered our understanding of TNBC, with a focus on the subtyping of TNBC.
We also explore the implications of these discoveries for future treatments and highlight the need for clinical trials focusing
on subtypes of TNBC.
Characterization of TNBC

It has been well over a decade since Perou et al published their seminal article categorizing breast cancer by gene expression
profiling into intrinsic subtypes and later developed the PAM50 assay.3 The basal-like subtype was identified as particularly

aggressive and is characterized by lack of ER/PR/HER2
expression. Various studies have demonstrated an association of basal-like breast cancers with the expression of cytokeratins 5 and 6 (CK5/6), CK14, and CK17;
P-cadherin; p53; and epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR).4-8 Mutations and genomic deletions in tumor
protein 53 (TP53) and retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) are common in this subtype, along with high proliferation indices.9-11 Although most TNBCs classify as the basal-like
subtype based on the intrinsic subtype classification, the
terms TNBC and basal-like breast cancer are not synonymous; approximately 20% to 30% of clinical TNBCs are
not basal-like by microarray analysis, and significant numbers of basal-like breast cancers express ER/PR or
HER2.12-14
Several newer studies have refined our understanding of TNBCs. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Research Network analyzed primary breast cancers using
6 platforms that included genomic DNA copy number
arrays, DNA methylation, exome sequencing, messenger
RNA arrays, microRNA sequencing, and reverse-phase
protein arrays.15 By integrating information across platforms, TCGA was able to examine the genomic heterogeneity of tumors. TCGA analysis demonstrated that the
most frequent loss-of-function and gain-of-function alterations in TNBC involve genes associated with DNA damage repair and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
signaling pathways, respectively.15 Alterations in DNA
damage-repair genes include loss of TP53, RB1, and
BRCA1 function. Aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway occurs because of loss of negative regulators, such as
the lipid phosphatases (phosphatase and tensin homolog
[PTEN] or inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II,
105 kDa [INPP4B])16,17 or activating mutations in PIK3
catalytic subunit a (PIK3CA)18 along with other genes in
the PI3K/target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling network.4,18 In another study, Shah and colleagues
sequenced and analyzed more than 100 TNBC tumors at
the time of diagnosis and confirmed the high rate of TP53
mutations; however, they demonstrated that 12% of
tumors did not have somatic mutations in any established
driver genes, suggesting that primary TNBCs are mutationally heterogeneous from the outset.19
Tumors arising in carriers of BRCA1 have many similarities to basal-like sporadic breast tumors, including a
greater likelihood having a high frequency of TP53 mutations and of being high-grade, ER-negative/PR-negative,
and HER2-negative. Basal keratins are expressed by both
sporadic basal-like tumors and tumors with BRCA1 mutations, and both groups cluster together by gene expression

profiling.20 Other studies support these data, in which
familial BRCA1 breast cancers have shared features with a
subset of sporadic tumors, indicating a similar etiology.
Hallmarks of this “BRCAness” include basal-like phenotype (associated with the BRCA1 phenotype but not with
the BRCA2 phenotype), ER negativity, EGFR expression,
c-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog
(c-MYC) amplification, TP53 mutations, loss of RAD 51
recombinase (RAD51)-focus formation, extreme genomic
instability, and sensitivity to DNA-cross-linking agents.21
This intrinsic genomic instability in TNBCs and BRCAassociated breast cancers is likely a result of deficient
DNA repair and may lead to the success of some chemotherapy regimens.22 The translational strategy for this
group of tumors with “BRCAness” is the design of
rational clinical trials that investigate the role of chemotherapy and biologic agents targeting DNA repair defects.
Subtyping TNBC

To better understand the molecular underpinnings of
TNBC, our group compiled an extensive number of
TNBC gene expression profiles and initiated molecular
subtyping of the disease.23 We reported that TNBC is a
heterogeneous disease composed of distinct molecular
subtypes, each with a unique biology that responds differentially to current therapies. We identified 2 basal-like
TNBC subtypes, 1 with cell cycle and DNA damage
response gene expression signatures (BL1) and the other
enriched in growth factor signaling and myoepithelial
markers (BL2); 2 mesenchymal subtypes with high
expression of genes involved in differentiation and growth
factor pathways (M and MSL); an immunomodulatory
(IM) type; and a luminal subtype driven by androgen signaling (luminal androgen receptor [LAR]) (Fig. 1). Differential gene expression was used to designate TNBC cell
line models representative of these subtypes, and predicted “driver” signaling pathways were pharmacologically targeted in these preclinical models as proof of
concept that the analysis of distinct gene expression signatures can inform therapy selection. Cell line models representing each of the TNBC subtypes also displayed
different sensitivities to targeted therapeutic agents. We
observed that representative BL1 subtype cell lines preferentially respond to cisplatin. Mesenchymal and luminal
subtype lines with aberrations in PI3K signaling have the
greatest sensitivity, in general, to PI3K pathway inhibitors. The mesenchymal subtypes preferentially respond to
the nonspecific SRC inhibitor dasatinib. The LAR subtype cell lines express androgen receptor (AR) and are sensitive to the AR antagonist bicalutamide and to PI3K

inhibitors. Sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors is caused by the
high frequency of mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the p110a catalytic subunit of PI3K, in LAR cell lines
(approximately 40%).23
We validated our subtyping by using TNBC RNA
sequencing data from TCGA. We determined a statistically similar distribution of subtypes across 163 TNBC
cases from TCGA (Fig. 2A). When we analyzed DNA
sequencing data for these TCGA cases, we observed that
50% of the AR-positive tumors had PIK3CA mutations.
Also noteworthy was the enrichment of PIK3CA, PIK3
regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), and PTEN mutations in
the BL2 subtype. Further analysis suggested increased
PI3K pathway activity, because reverse-phase protein
arrays demonstrated that both the BL2 and LAR subtypes
had increased levels of phosphorylated protein kinase B
(pAKT) (S473 and T308). PTEN protein levels were
slightly lower in TNBC; however, INPP4B levels were
substantially decreased across all TNBC subtypes
(Fig. 2B). These data demonstrate that, despite having a
lower PIK3CA mutation rate, TNBCs and, especially specific subtypes, display active PI3K pathway signaling.
We also performed a direct comparison of 374
TNBC samples to determine the correlation between
10

PAM50 intrinsic subtypes and TNBC molecular subtypes.24 The majority of the TNBC samples indeed were
classified as basal-like by PAM50 (80.6%), as anticipated.
However, a significant number were classified in other
categories: normal-like (14.6%), luminal B (3.5%), luminal A (1.1%), and HER2 (0.2%). With the exceptions of
MSL and LAR, all other TNBC subtypes were primarily
composed of the basal-like intrinsic subtype. Of MSL
TNBCs, approximately 50% were basal-like, 27.8% were
normal-like, 13.9% were luminal B, and the remaining
approximately 8% were HER2 and luminal A by intrinsic
subtyping. Unlike other subtypes, the LAR subtype was
primarily classified as HER2 (74.3%) and luminal B
(14.3%) by PAM50 intrinsic subtyping. Therefore,
PAM50 intrinsic subtyping alone has the potential to classify approximately 75% of TNBCs that are AR-positive as
HER2-positive.24
Treatment Implications

The heterogeneity of TNBCs has made finding actionable
targets and the development of targeted therapies particularly difficult. Clinical trials that include all TNBCs based
on immunohistochemical staining to target a particular
receptor or pathway have largely demonstrated shown

only limited benefit.25,26 One of the first of these studies
targeted EGFR, which was up-regulated in approximately
60% of basal-like TNBCs.4 A clinical trial in which
patients received chemotherapy with or without the
EGFR inhibitor cetuximab produced only a modest
improvement in the response rate with the addition of
cetuximab (28% vs 33%).27 More recently, a study of cisplatin with or without cetuximab in patients with metastatic TNBC demonstrated that the addition of
cetuximab doubled the response rate from 10% to 20%
and increased progression-free survival (PFS) from 1.5
months to 3.7 months, but neither endpoint reached statistical significance.28 Studies that have evaluated cetuximab as a single agent also have been disappointing.25
Although there are many reasons why such studies failed
to demonstrate a significant benefit, there is a possibility
that the heterogeneity of TNBCs diluted the effect of a
treatment that otherwise would have been effective in a
smaller, selected group of TNBCs. Currently, several
promising new targets are being explored, as discussed
below.
Targeting BRCA and “BRCA-ness”

The idea that TNBCs have a “BRCA-ness” has led to clinical trials focusing on platinum salts, including carboplatin and cisplatin, which lead to DNA cross-link strand
breaks. BRCA1 plays a key role in DNA double-strand
break repair by mediating homologous recombination
and thereby maintaining DNA stability.29 Thus, the platinum agents may be especially important in cells that are
deficient in homologous recombination repair mechanisms, such as BRCA-mutated cells and TNBCs. Silver
et al conducted a phase 2 study of 29 patients highlighting
the activity of single-agent, neoadjuvant cisplatin for the
treatment of patients with locally advanced TNBC. The
pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in those patients
was 22% with cisplatin alone.30 In another small study, 9
of 10 patients with stage I, II, or III breast cancer who harbored BRCA1 mutations achieved pathologic complete
remission after neoadjuvant therapy with cisplatin.31
More recently, the addition of carboplatin to neoadjuvant paclitaxel, anthracycline, and bevacizumab in
the GeparSixto trial improved pCR rates from 37.9% to
58.7% with the addition of carboplatin in a subset of
patients with TNBC.32 Biomarker studies in that trial
are underway to determine whether certain TNBC subsets benefit more from the addition of carboplatin, and
those results should provide insights to markers of
response. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB) study CALGB40603 (clinicaltrials.gov
12

identifier NCT00861705) was a randomized phase 2
study of 454 patients with stage II and III TNBC examining the addition of carboplatin and/or bevacizumab to
weekly neoadjuvant paclitaxel followed by dose-dense
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.33 The primary endpoint in that study was a pCR in the breast, and a secondary endpoint was a pCR in the breast and axillae. The
results, which were presented at the 2013 San Antonio
Breast Cancer Symposium, demonstrated that the addition of carboplatin to standard chemotherapy resulted in
a significant improvement in pCR rates both for the breast
alone (range, 46%-60% with carboplatin) and for the
breast and axillae (range, 41%-54%; P 5.0029). The benefit from carboplatin was independent of bevacizumab.
Bevacizumab also resulted in a pCR benefit, but that benefit was significant only in the breast and was at the cost of
a significant increase in toxicities. A phase 2 study of neoadjuvant cisplatin and paclitaxel with or without everolimus in patients with early stage TNBC did not
demonstrate any apparent clinical benefit from the addition of everolimus; however, an overall pCR rate of 38%
was noted, again highlighting the effectiveness of the platinum agents in this population.34
In general, patients with TNBC who do not achieve
a pCR after neoadjuvant therapy have a significantly
worse prognosis, which lends even greater importance to
understanding which tumors will have a suboptimal
response to platinum agents.1 A study that has recently
initiated study accrual is evaluating how well TNBCs that
do not carry a germline BRCA mutation respond to neoadjuvant cisplatin or paclitaxel chemotherapy and
whether the use of a homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) assay can predict response to the 2 chemotherapies (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01982448).
The HRD assay is a tumor DNA-based assay that can
identify underlying defects in the homologous recombination pathway, regardless of etiology, with high sensitivity. The assay evaluates loss of heterozygosity; a higher loss
of heterozygosity count reflects more areas of genomic
loss in the tumor and more genomic instability because of
underlying DNA defects.35 The primary objective of the
study is to evaluate the correlation between the HRD biomarker and pathologic response to cisplatin or paclitaxel.
The HRD assay, in effect, should predict “BRCA-ness”
and potentially provide an important test to help predict
which tumors are likely to respond to platinum
compounds.
BRCA-deficient tumors rely more heavily on polyAD-ribose polymerase (PARP) to mediate DNA repair,
because homologous recombination mechanisms of repair
Cancer

Subtyping Triple-Negative Breast Cancer/Abramson et al

are impaired in this group of patients. PARP enzymes are
critical for base excision repair of single-strand DNA
breaks; and, because these mechanisms of DNA repair are
more important in BRCA-deficient tumors, PARP inhibition results in high antitumor activity.36-41 Inhibition of
this enzyme by RNA interference or with chemical inhibitors leads to severe, highly selective toxicity in BRCA1-defective and BRCA2-defective cells, with selectivity that is
several-fold higher than that for conventional chemotherapy drugs.42 Reduction in PARP activity leads to chromosomal instability, cell cycle arrest, and subsequent
apoptosis, most likely because of the persistence of DNA
lesions that normally are repaired by homologous recombination. Sensitivity to PARP inhibition depends on homologous recombination deficiency and not necessarily
on inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 deficiency.39 Therefore,
the use of PARP1 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for
the treatment of sporadic breast cancers with
“BRCAness,” including basal-like breast cancers, may be a
potential approach.
Investigational use of PARP inhibitors has produced
an impressive clinical response in patients with BRCA1mutations; however, other patients with TNBC who
appeared to have a “BRCA-deficient phenotype” have not
responded as expected. Significant single-agent activity
was reported with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients
with BRCA-deficient, metastatic breast cancer. Overall
responses ranged from 22% at doses of 100 mg twice daily
to 41% at doses of 400 mg twice daily with minimal toxicity.37 Olaparib as a single agent also was evaluated in a
phase 2 study of patients with recurrent, high-grade, serous or poorly differentiated ovarian carcinoma or
TNBC.43 In the latter trial, however, no confirmed objective responses were observed in the 26 patients with
TNBC.
A phase 2, open-label, 2-arm, randomized, safety
and efficacy trial investigated gemcitabine/carboplatin
with or without iniparib in patients with metastatic
TNBC.44 The final analysis of 123 randomized patients
from that trial demonstrated that the addition of iniparib
to gemcitabine/carboplatin improved the clinical benefit
rate from 33.9% to 55.7% (P5.015) and improved the
overall response rate from 32.3% to 52.5% (P5.023).
The addition of iniparib prolonged the median PFS from
3.6 to 5.9 months (hazard ratio, 0.59; P5.012) and prolonged the median overall survival from 7.7 to 12.3
months (hazard ratio, 0.57; P5.014).44 A subsequent
phase 3 study that evaluated gemcitabine/carboplatin
with or without iniparib using inclusion criteria similar
to those used in the phase 2 study did not meet the
Cancer

January 1, 2015

prespecified criteria of significance for the coprimary endpoints of overall survival and PFS.45 Concerns have been
raised that the lack of benefit of iniparib in the phase 3
study are because of the more recent understanding that
iniparib is not a PARP inhibitor. Thus, the small clinical
benefit with iniparib observed in the phase 2 study, which
did not reach statistical significance in the phase 3 study,
may have been caused by another mechanism of action
that does not affect the TNBC group as a whole. It is important to highlight the impressive response rate for a relatively heavily pretreated population in the control group.
Both the phase 2 and 3 studies produced a response rate of
approximately 30% with carboplatin/gemcitabine alone,
again underscoring the efficacy of platinum agents in
TNBC. More recently, a single-arm phase 2 study of neoadjuvant gemcitabine, carboplatin, and iniparib in
patients with TNBC or BRCA1/BRCA2 mutationassociated breast cancer produced impressive responses,
especially in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers.46 It is possible that,
beyond BRCA-mutated cancers, the benefit of PARP
inhibitors will be limited to a subgroup of TNBCs. Clinical trials and biomarker studies are needed to explore
which TNBCs respond to this group of drugs.
Results from the first drug to complete testing in the
adaptive design, neoadjuvant breast cancer I-SPY 2 study
(a PARP inhibitor in combination with carboplatin) also
were presented at the 2013 San Antonio Breast Cancer
Symposium.47 This was a study of standard chemotherapy that included weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks followed
by an anthracycline-based regimen for 4 cycles versus the
same regimen with the addition of the carboplatin and the
PARP inhibitor veliparib. All patients had a breast tumor
measuring at least 2.5 cm and had TNBC or were deemed
high risk according to results from a MammaPrint test
(Agendia Inc., Irvine, Calif). The pCR for patients who
had TNBC was 26% for those who received standard
chemotherapy compared with 52% for those who
received the standard regimen plus carboplatin and veliparib. The benefit from carboplatin versus veliparib could
not be extracted, because all patients either received the
standard regimen alone or received both of these drugs.
The results correspond to a 99% probability that the addition of carboplatin/veliparib is superior to the control regimen alone; and, based on these results, a 300-patient,
phase 3, neoadjuvant study is planned to initiate in 2014.

cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy.48
The overall pCR response was 28%, and it is noteworthy
that subtype-specific responses differed substantially.
Patients with the BL1 subtype achieved the highest pCR
rate (52%); and those with the BL2, LAR, and MSL subtypes had the lowest response rates (0%, 10%, and 23%,
respectively). TNBC subtype also was identified as an independent predictor of pCR status (P5.022) using a
likelihood-ratio test.48 Those results speak not only to the
heterogeneity of TNBCs but also for the need to align
patients to different therapies based on the subtype of their
disease.
We observed that, as discussed above, approximately
10% of TNBCs classify as the LAR subtype. This subtype,
which is driven by AR signaling, may be uniquely sensitive
to androgen blockers. Immunohistochemistry indicates
that LAR subtype cell lines have a significantly higher percentage of tumor cells with nuclear AR staining and a
higher intensity of staining compared with other all other
TNBC subtypes (>10-fold; P<.004). A study evaluating
the antiandrogen bicalutamide in patients with metastatic
TNBCs, which express the AR by immunohistochemistry, demonstrated a 6-month clinical benefit rate of 19%
(95% confidence interval, 7%-39%) for bicalutamide and
a median PFS of 12 weeks (95% confidence interval,
11-22 weeks)49 The AR inhibitor enzalutamide also is currently being explored in patients with TNBC who express
the AR (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01889238). In
addition to expression of the AR, LAR subtype cell lines
have a high rate of PIK3CA-activating mutations and exhibit strong sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors.23 The coevolution of PIK3CA mutations with AR dependency is similar
to ER-positive breast cancers, which have a high frequency
of PIK3CA mutations.50,51 Preclinical data indicate that
the combination of bicalutamide with a PI3K inhibitor
produces an additive/synergistic effect, specifically in LAR
cell lines.
PI3K inhibition may also be relevant for non-LAR
tumors. Studies have provided preclinical rationale for
the combined use of a DNA-damaging agent with PI3K
inhibitors by demonstrating that, in addition to regulating cell growth, metabolism, and survival, PI3K also stabilizes double-strand breaks by interacting with the
homologous recombination complex and, in effect, creates a BRCA-deficient state.52 PI3K blockade promotes
homologous recombination deficiency by downregulating BRCA1/BRCA2 and, thus, sensitizing BRCAproficient tumors to PARP inhibition. To capitalize on
these findings, a phase 1 study is ongoing of the
pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 (Novartis Corporation,
14

New York, NY) in combination with the PARP inhibitor
olaparib in patients with metastatic TNBC (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01623349). BKM120 is
expected to create a BRCA mutant-like tumor state, thus
making it susceptible to PARP inhibition.
Our studies of combinations of PI3K inhibitors and
cisplatin demonstrate either additive or synergistic
decreases in tumor viability, with significant decreases in
pAKT and pS6 levels and a concomitant elevation in
cleaved PARP. Altogether, these data suggest that targeting the PI3K pathway could be clinically relevant in
TNBC. Our group is now initiating clinical trials in
which therapy for patients with metastatic TNBC will be
determined by AR status. In the first study, patients whose
tumors express AR by immunohistochemistry will receive
an antiandrogen with a PI3K inhibitor and will be spared
the toxicity of a chemotherapy regimen with expected limited benefit. In the second study, patients with tumors
that do not express the AR will be randomized to chemotherapy with cisplatin with or without a PI3K inhibitor.
The AR-negative study is now active (clinicaltrials.gov
identifier NCT01918306).
Conclusions

Despite the promise of targeted therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for patients
with TNBC. This is problematic not only because of the
numerous toxicities of cytotoxic chemotherapy but also
because recurrence rates after early stage disease remain
high, and the survival of patients who have metastatic disease remains dismal. The identification of molecular subtypes is essential for understanding the biologic
characteristics and clinical behaviors of TNBC as well as
for developing personalized treatments.
We recently identified TNBC subtypes with corresponding molecular drivers and preclinical models to develop effective therapeutic approaches. We are translating
our preclinical findings into targeted, subtype-specific
clinical trials for patients with TNBC based on our understanding of the biologic drivers of the different TNBC
subtypes. In particular, the LAR subtype is predicted to
have the least benefit from traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and, based on our preclinical work, will derive
great benefit from targeting both the AR and PI3K,
because PIK3CA mutation may be a major driver for this
subtype. It is possible that the mediocre efficacy of drugs
targeting TNBCs observed in many previous studies may
be because of the nonspecific inclusion of all TNBCs,
including the LAR and mesenchymal subtypes. Drugs
that would result in stellar responses if only the BL1

subtype was included in a particular clinical trial might
demonstrate an overall less robust response because of the
inclusion of other subtypes that do not respond to the
same drugs. Thus, by including all subtypes of TNBC in
clinical trials, we may be eliminating effective therapies
for certain subtypes of TNBC by diluting the observed
response rates, clinical benefit rates, and, ultimately, overall survival.
TNBC is clearly a complex disease, and its impressive heterogeneity adds to the challenge of identifying targets and treatments. To effectively tackle this disease, the
focus will need to be on clinical trials of increasingly
smaller subsets of TNBC patients. The subsets will be
defined by molecular and genetic characteristics that classify a patient’s tumor into a subtype (ie, receptor expression or mutation). Because of cross-talk between
pathways, which may be especially relevant in TNBC, it is
likely that combinations of targeted agents ultimately will
be required to optimally treat the disease. Ongoing and
planned studies of various pathway inhibitors in addition
to those reviewed above, including c-met inhibitors, PD-1
inhibitors, aurora kinase inhibitors, and others, will help
determine clinically relevant targets. Clinical trials will
need to collect tissue before and after disease progression
to understand mechanisms of resistance so that we can develop treatment combinations to target all relevant pathways from the onset. Our comprehension of TNBC has
grown in the past 5 years. The goal in the coming years
will be to expand this knowledge and to initiate and encourage participation in more clinical trials that align
patients to appropriate treatments and capitalize on our
ever-increasing understanding of TNBC.
