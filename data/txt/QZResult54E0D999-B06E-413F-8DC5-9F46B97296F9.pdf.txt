ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a cancer with increasing incidence and largely
refractory to current anticancer drugs. Since Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor has
shown modest efficacy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma additional treatments are
highly needed. Protein phosphorylation via kinases is an important post-translational
modification to regulate cell homeostasis including proliferation and apoptosis.
Therefore kinases are valuable targets in cancer therapy. To this end we performed
2D differential gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis of phosphoproteinenriched lysates of tumor and corresponding non-tumorous liver samples to detect
differentially abundant phosphoproteins to screen for novel kinases as potential
drug targets. We identified 34 differentially abundant proteins in phosphoprotein
enriched lysates. Expression and distribution of the candidate protein eEF2 and its
phosphorylated isoform was validated immunohistochemically on 78 hepatocellular
carcinoma and non-tumorous tissue samples. Validation showed that total eEF2 and
phosphorylated eEF2 at threonine 56 are prognostic markers for overall survival of
HCC-patients. The activity of the regulating eEF2 kinase, compared between tumor
and non-tumorous tissue lysates by in vitro kinase assays, is more than four times
higher in tumor tissues. Functional analyzes regarding eEF2 kinase were performed
in JHH5 cells with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated eEF2 kinase knock out. Proliferation and
growth is decreased in eEF2 kinase knock out cells.
Conclusion: eEF2 and phosphorylated eEF2 are prognostic markers for survival
of hepatocellular carcinoma patients and the regulating eEF2 kinase is a potential
drug target for tumor therapy.

It is the sixth most common neoplasm with increasing
incidence [1, 2]. Most cases of HCC are based on chronic
liver diseases like viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse [3].
As symptoms occur in advanced phases of the disease,
HCC commonly is detected at late stages and most of the
patients die within one year after diagnosis. One main

reason for poor prognosis is the lack of curative treatment.
One admitted therapy option is the multikinase inhibitor
Sorafenib, showing modest efficacy in advanced HCC
with frequently occurring side effects [4]. Thus, additional
treatments are highly needed and protein kinases came to
the fore because phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
of proteins are involved in many cellular processes, e.g.
metabolism, cellular signaling, proliferation, and cell
survival and control several biological responses such
as differentiation, invasion, metastasis and apoptosis [5,
6]. Changes in phosphorylation patterns can be either the
consequence or the cause of many diseases, e.g. cancer [7,
8]. As a consequence regulation of signaling pathways by
the responsible kinases is of particular interest to find new
therapeutically relevant drug targets [9–11]. Therefore,
in this study we initially compared phosphoproteinenriched lysates of HCC tissue and corresponding nontumorous liver samples of 7 HCC-patients in a classical
phosphoproteomic approach using 2D DIGE. Three
isoforms of eEF2 were identified to be differentially
abundant in HCC. In further studies, we could show that
expression of total eEF2 and eEF2 phosphorylated at
threonine 56 has a prognostic value for patients’ overall
survival and that the activity of eEF2 kinase, responsible
for the phosphorylation of eEF2, is significantly increased
in HCC-tissues. To investigate the influence of the eEF2
kinase on tumor cell growth in vitro we performed a
CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knock out in the HCC cell line
JHH5 and studied the effects on growth and proliferation.

to be generally phosphorylated but showed different
phosphorylation patterns in HCC tissue compared to
non-tumorous tissue (Supplementary Figure 2).

Expression of total eEF2 and peEF2(T56) is a
prognostic marker for overall survival of HCCpatients
To validate the overexpression tissue micro arrays
(TMAs) of an initial training set of 16 HCC-patients
were immunohistochemically stained against eEF2,
HSC70 and Moesin. After staining evaluation HSC70,
Moesin and pMoesin (phospho-Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin)
did not show differences between HCC and non-HCCtissues (data not shown). Therefore we decided to further
validate eEF2 only. In the validation set, TMAs of further
78 HCC-patients (Table 1) were immunohistochemically
stained against eEF2. A representative comparison of the
eEF2 staining of non-tumorous and HCC tissue is shown
in Figure 2A. Evaluation of eEF2 expression alone and
combined with intensity detected a significant increase
in tumor tissue (P<.001). Patients with a high combined
score of eEF2 positive cells and staining intensity had
significantly shorter overall survival rate (P<.001; Figure
2B). We further stained the TMAs of the HCC-patients
against peEF2(T56) (example is shown in Figure 2A). The
evaluation (Figure 2B, right graph) showed a prognostic
value in R0-resected HCC-patients (P=.001). TMAs for
immunohistochemical evaluation did include patients in
which HCC was based on HBV/HCV-infection (Table 1).
There was no correlation of HBV/HCV- infection with
number and staining intensity of eEF2 or peEF2(T56).

RESULTS
34 identified proteins showed differential
abundance in phosphoprotein-enriched lysates of
non-tumorous and HCC-liver tissues

peEF2(T56) is significantly increased in HCCpatients
In order to confirm the immunohistochemical data
and see whether peEF2(T56) alone is overrepresented in
HCC we investigated total protein lysates of non-tumorous
and HCC liver tissues for total eEF2 and peEF2(T56)
level by immunoblotting. Compared to the non-tumorous
situation in HCC-lysates we could observe an increase
of peEF2 to 109% as compared to non-tumorous level
(P=.05; Figure 3A). Comparing the ratio of peEF2 to total
eEF2 in HCC-lysates revealed a statistically significant
increase to 108% (P=.036; Figure 3A).

Within the 2D DIGE study of phosphoproteinenriched lysates from seven HCC-patients we identified
57 protein spots that were differentially abundant in
non-tumorous and tumor tissue of the patients. Criteria
for a differential abundance were a 1.5-fold over- or
underrepresentation and a statistical p-value of less than
.05. After mass spectrometric protein identification via
MALDI-TOF-MS peptide mass fingerprinting these
57 protein spots could be addressed to 34 different
proteins (Supplementary Table 1). In tumor tissue
12 proteins were over- und 22 underrepresented.
According to fold change and p-value cut off criteria,
the appearance in more than one spot on the gel and
being a known phosphoprotein, we chose three of these
proteins for initial further validation (Figure 1), namely:
heat shock cognate protein 71 (HSC70), Moesin, and
eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). For gel images
and normalized expression of HSC70 and Moesin please

with the eEF2K-specific inhibitor NH125 (3μM).
To rule out that these activity alteration is of
genetical origin, NGS was performed with 24 tumor
tissue samples and corresponding non-tumorous tissue.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in the
untranslated region were not tumor specific. Furthermore
no SNPs could be detected in the kinase domain. The

via the CRISPR/Cas9 system in JHH5 cells. The absence
of eEF2K was verified via immunoblotting for eEF2

single PCR fragments revealed in case of eEF2K+/- one
allele has a 16 bp deletion leading to a frameshift and
premature stop codon and the second allele has a deletion
of 3 bp, leading to deleted residue asp177, and hence to a
functional protein.
Growth curve experiments were normalized to
confluence and exhibited an increased doubling time for
eEF2K-/- cells (Control cells: 46 h ± 6h; eEF2K-/- 62 h
± 6h; P=.02). The calculated doubling time of eEF2K+/cells is merely slightly increased (51h ± 8h). Increment of
cells related to initial cell number is shown in Figure 4B.
Immunohistochemical staining of the proliferation marker
Ki67 showed significantly less proliferative cells (84 %
positively stained nuclei in control cells, 68 % positive
nuclei in eEF2K-/-; P=.002), while eEF2K+/- cells have a
more similar proliferation rate compared to control cells
(81 %, P=.1). (Figure 4D).
For morphologic studies and further comparison
of proliferation the cells were grown on chamber slides
for 24 hours and directly formalin fixed on the slides.

Fixation and staining revealed a significant 2,3-fold
(P<.001) enlargement of eEF2K-/- cells (500 μm2 ± 129
μm2 compared to 217 μm2 ± 68 μm) while the mean
area of eEF2K+/- cells was two times higher compared to
control cells (425 μm2 ± 104μm2) (Figure 5A). This was
paralleled by an increase of nuclei size. While control
nuclei have a mean area of 99 μm2 ±36 μm2, eEF2K-/- cells
show an increased area of 267 μm2 ± 78 μm2. Nuclear size
of eEF2K+/- is increased 1.6 times (166 μm2 ± 67 μm2)
(Figure 5A). Since the main reason for enlarged nuclei is
an increase in DNA, as a rule caused by polyploidization
we determined the DNA content and analyzed the cell
cycle distribution using flow cytometry of propidium
iodide (PI) stained cells. The mean PI fluorescence
intensity is 2,4x 106 RFU in stained control nuclei while it
is 4,4x 106 RFU and 4x106 RFU for eEF2K-/- and eEF2K+/nuclei, respectively (Figure 5B). Distribution of cell cycle
phases revealed a marginal cell cycle delay at G1 (59 %
of cells) as shown in Figure 5B. Western blot analysis

phosphorylation states as eEF2 is not only phosphorylated
at regulating threonine 56 by the eEF2 kinase but also
at serine 595 by Cyclin A-Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2
serving as a “docking” phosphorylation for eEF2 kinase
[16, 17]. Evaluating immunohistochemical staining
of eEF2 and peEF2(T56) showed that this protein and
its phosphorylation are highly significant prognostic
markers for overall survival of HCC-patients. High eEF2
levels have been suggested to be associated with poor
prognosis in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer
[18]. Additionally, eEF2 was found to be overexpressed
in gastrointestinal cancers promoting G2/M progression

DISCUSSION
The average number of spots we detected
comparing the enriched phosphoproteins of 7 HCCpatients was in a similar range of resolution compared
to other gel-based phosphoproteomic studies [12–15].
Comparison of untreated and dephosphorylated protein
lysates after off-gel fractionation could point to different

combined with high intensity have a significant shorter survival time.

and enhancing cell growth in vitro and in vivo [19]. An
overexpression of eEF2 is already known from several
transformed cell lines and also in HCC [19–22], but to
our knowledge this study for the first time describes a
prognostic value of eEF2 and peEF2(T56) expression for
HCC.
In the process of protein translation, eEF2 plays an
important regulatory role. Being phosphorylated by eEF2
kinase at threonine 56 eEF2 loses its activity resulting
in a decreased or even completely suppressed protein
biosynthesis [23]. This regulation is essential for survival

once the cell has entered a state of lacking energy. The
microenvironment of solid tumors is characterized
by hypoxia and one important step in progression to
malignant disease seems to be the successful overcoming
of translational regulation during hypoxia [24–27]. As high
activity and levels of eEF2 kinase are thought to be the
basis for tumors to become resistant to nutrient deprivation
[29] we checked whether we could find increased eEF2
kinase activity in HCC-lysates. In vitro kinase assays
of immunoprecipitated eEF2 kinase indeed showed a
4-5 times higher activity in tumor lysates compared to

expression of peEF2(T56) in HCC tissue compared to non-tumorous tissue based on densiometric analyses of immunoblots (left panel). The

cells. Boxes represent 25th and 75th percentiles; whiskers indicate the standard deviation. The median is shown as a horizontal line,
and the mean value as a square within the box. The lines interconnect the corresponding HCC and NT tissue of single patients. B. EEF2
kinase activity was determined by in vitro kinase assay of non-tumorous and HCC-liver lysates. In tumor lysates the eEF2 kinase activity
was significantly increased compared to non-tumorous lysates. As a control tumor lysates were treated with the eEF2 kinase inhibitor
NH125 (3μM), which abolished kinase activity nearly completely. Activity of non-tumorous lysates was set to 100%. Immunoblots against
immunoprecipitated eEF2 kinase confirmed that equal amounts of the kinase were put into the assay. * P<.01, all data are mean ± SE.

the corresponding non-tumorous liver lysates. Several
transformed cell lines overexpress eEF2 and eEF2 kinase,
which in turn leads to elevated levels of phosphorylated
eEF2 [19–21]. Thus, elevated activity of eEF2 kinase
in HCC-tissues might be a rational explanation for the
observed increased levels of phosphorylated eEF2 in these
tissues. Little is known about the regulation of expression
and activity of eEF2 kinase. eEF2 kinase knockout mice
are vital and fertile showing no obvious differences to
wildtype littermates [30]. Regulation of activity seems
to be a complicated mix of autophosphorylation in
combination with additional activating or inhibiting
phosphorylations [23]. Studies correlating downregulation

of the eEF2 kinase with decreased levels of, e.g. Bcl-2
and Cyclin D1, suggest that eEF2 kinase directly or
indirectly inhibits signal pathways that are associated
with transformation [31]. Besides eEF2 and eEF2 kinase
were found to be possible drug targets in gastrointestinal
and breast cancer [19, 31]. Wang et al. reported a tumor
suppressing activity of the herbal formulation Huanglian
Jiedu Decoction by activating the eEF2 kinase and thus
inhibiting eEF2 in HCC [32]. Contrary, Tekedereli and
colleagues reported that a siRNA-silencing of eEF2
kinase resulted in growth inhibition of tumor cells [31].
Since siRNA knockdown usually does not lead to the total
absence of a protein we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technique

to knock out the kinase. Interestingly, a biallelic knock out
with only less expression and activity of the kinase shows
the same morphological changes but does not decrease
the proliferation rate of HCC cells, while a total absence
of the kinase results in a significant decrease of doubling
time and proliferation discovered by Ki67, even without
lacking energy. These data indicate that the eEF2 kinase
itself or through negative feedback mechanisms could be
involved in broader cellular pathways than described until
now.
Confusing is the fact that the absence of this kinase
which is only reported as the inhibitor of eEF2 leads to
a vast increase of the size. However, a knock out of the
eEF2 kinase leads to an increased translation rate by eEF2
activation. The interaction between mass accumulation
and cell division is not fully understood but general
opinion is that they are completely separate processes [33].
Potentially, a higher translation rate accompanied by less
proliferation leads to a size increment. Recently, a newly
identified autophosphorylation site of ERK2 was reported
to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy [34]. In eEF2K-/cells phosphorylation of this residue is highly increased.
Brietz et al. hypothesized pERK2(T188) phosphorylates
additional targets located at the nucleus and promote the
hypertrophic response [35]. The along going increase
of nuclear area is also an indication for dysfunctions in
regular cell growth and division. Nuclear DNA was PI
stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. Here, a marginal
cell cycle delay at G0/G1 phase was observable. Since flow
cytometric analysis of PI stained cells cannot distinguish
between G0 (quiescence) and G1 phase [36], relating to the
Ki67 staining results, it is likely that more knock out cells
rest in G0 phase. One key regulator of G0/G1- S transition is
Cyclin D1. Consistent to cell cycle analysis the expression
of Cyclin D1 is decreased in eEF2K knock out cells. The
peak shift to higher PI fluorescence intensities of around
2-fold reflects the double DNA content of knock out cells.
It is reported, that hepatocytes are prone to increase their
ploidy in terms of DNA damage [37] and cellular stress
factors e.g. oxidative stress [38]. Also a hyperactivation
of ERK1/2 is reported to promote aneuploidy by
polyploidization [39]. However, the mechanisms how the
absence of the eEF2 kinase impairs this pathway remain
unclear and have to be subject of future studies.
Given that in embryonic fibroblasts of eEF2K-/mice this change in cellular phenotype is not reported
[40, 41], this phenomenon could be cell type specific and
likely would not occur within treatment of HCC. Yao
et al. proposed C-terminal eEF2 fragments located in
the nucleus promote abnormal nuclear morphology and
polyploidy [42]. However, we immunohistochemically
stained formalin-fixed control and eEF2K-/- cells with an
antibody against C-terminal eEF2 and no nuclear staining
was observable (Supplementary data).
In summary we could show that eEF2 and
peEF2(T56) are overexpressed in HCC-tissues and have
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a prognostic value for overall survival of HCC-patients.
Additionally, we could demonstrate that eEF2 kinase
exhibits a 4-5 fold increased activity in HCC tissue.
Knocking out eEF2 kinase in tumor cells results in less
proliferative cells and a decreased growth rate, though the
increased translation leads to augmentation of cell size.
Concluding these results, we propose eEF2 kinase being a
possible and valuable drug target for HCC therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Informed consent was obtained from every
patient and the study protocol conforms to the ethical
guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. The local
ethics committee approved the study (#15–6230-BO).
Clinicopathological patient data is shown in Table 1. The
tissue for TMAs and proteome-based studies was collected
from 1999 until 2005 and in 2011/2012, respectively. Only
patient without prior treatment were included.

Phosphoprotein enrichment
Pierce Phosphoprotein Enrichment Kit (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) was used for
enrichment of phosphoproteins. Samples were treated
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,
tissue samples were homogenized in lysis buffer
containing 0.25% CHAPS (3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)
dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate)
and
HALT protease- and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). 4 mg of total protein
were applied to phosphoprotein enrichment columns.
Bound phosphoproteins were washed 3 times with lysis/
binding/wash buffer (+0.25% CHAPS). Phosphoproteins
were eluted using elution buffer (+0.25% CHAPS) and
concentrated by vacuum concentration.

2D DIGE experiments
Protein labeling, 2D electrophoresis, scanning,
image analysis, and statistics as well as digestion and
peptide protein identification using mass spectrometry
were performed as recently described [43].

Immunohistochemical staining
Briefly, specimens were fixed overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin.
Sections (1 μm) were pretreated with citrate buffer
pH 6.0 for 30 min at 98°C. Primary antibodies used for
immunohistochemistry are listed in Supplementary Table
2. Corresponding secondary enzyme-labeled antibodies
were used in combination with the appropriate detection
system. Sections were counterstained hematoxylin.

kinase. Unspecific kinase activity was determined by
addition of the eEF2 kinase inhibitor NH125 (3 μM,
Calbiochem (part of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany))
to indicated samples. After 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction
was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer. Proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE and phosphorylation of
MBP was quantified by PhosphoImager analysis. Protein
amounts of immunoprecipitated eEF2K were controlled
by Western blot analysis. Statistical evaluation was done
using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Next generation sequencing
Multiplex PCR and purification were performed
with the GeneRead DNAseq Custom Panel, GeneRead
DNAseq Panel PCR Kit V2 (Qiagen, USA) and
Agencourt® AMPure® XP Beads (Beckmann, USA) on
24 randomly chosen NT and T tissue pairs. The library
preparation was performed with NEBNext Ultra DNA
Library Prep Set for Illumina (New England Biolabs,
Ipswich, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations by using 24 different indices per run.
The pooled library was sequenced on MiSeq (Illumina;
Reagent Kit V2; 2x150 bases paired-end run) and analyzed
by Genomics Workbench (CLC Bio, Qiagen, USA). For
read-mapping the eEF2K gene (NCBI-database) preserved
as a reference.
For targeted sequencing a customized eEF2Kpanel was designed covering 100% of the gene (including
UTRs). The CDS of the gene eEF2K was covered by a
total of 88 amplicons. In the two runs an average coverage
of approximately 8000x and 4500x was obtained.

Western blotting
Lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (T-PER lysis
buffer containing HALT protease- and phosphataseinhibitors; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA),
separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Whatman, part of GE Healthcare, Munich,
Germany). Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed
milk/TBS pH7.6/0.1% Tween20 for 1 h and incubated with
primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 2) overnight.
Corresponding horseradish-peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin G (1:15000; Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA) was then added for 60 min at room
temperature. Finally, enhanced chemiluminescence
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) was used to
visualize the results. Expression levels were analyzed by
densitometry and normalized to total protein staining of
the according lanes.

Cell lines
Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line JHH5 [44,
45] (JCRB1029, JCRB cell bank, Japan) were cultured in
William’s medium E with 10 % FCS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere at 37°C.

eEF2 kinase assay
Lysates from liver tissue were prepared using lysis
buffer (0.5% (v/v) NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2,
25 mM Na4P2O7, 50 mM β-glycerol phosphate disodium
salt, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 25 mM Tris, pH8.0,
10% (v/v) glycerol, 10μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor,
1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM PMSF, 50 mM NaF, 0.1
mM Na3VO4, 0.002% (w/v) NaN3). EEF2 kinase was
immunoprecipitated using eEF2K antibodies (5 μl/mg
lysate, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA)
bound to Protein A sepharose beads and with gentle
rotation for 2h at 4°C. Beads were washed three to four
times in phosphorylation buffer containing 50 mM Hepes
(pH7.4), 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2. For the kinase
assay myelin basic protein (MBP; 1μg/sample; SigmaAldrich, Steinheim, Germany), Calmodulin (2.5μg/
sample; Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μM ATP and [γ-32P]ATP
(0.5-0.75μCi/sample; Hartmann-Analytic, Braunschweig,

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock out
Cells were transfected via electroporation (Neon
transfection system, Life technologies, CA, USA) with the
following parameters: Pulse voltage: 1200 V, pulse width:
50 ms, pulse number: 1, 500000 cells/ml. For Knockout the GeneArt® CRISPR nuclease Vector with OFP
reporter (Life technologies; CA, USA) containing a 20bp
guideRNA (top strand: 5’CTACATCGAGCCCGTAGACC
3’; bottom strand: 5’GGTCTACGGGCTCGATGTAG
3’) was used. For control cells no guiding RNA was
inserted. The guideRNA was selected with the assistance
of the CRISPR design tool from the Zhang laboratory at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (http://crispr.
mit.edu/) and targets exon 6 of the human eEF2K gene.
Five different gRNAs were tested for Cas9 cleavage

efficiency with GeneArt genomic cleavage detection
kit (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as stated in
the manufacturer’s manual. Only the gRNA yielding the
highest cleavage rate was chosen for further transfection.
Transfected cells were single cell cloned into 96-well
plates at 0,3 cells/well, checked for the expression
of OFP, expanded to populations and analyzed by
PCR amplifying this region of genomic DNA using
primers flanking the target region in eEF2K [forward:
GCTCAGGAAGAACAGGGAACACC,
reverse:
GGATTCACCATGGCCCTCTTTC] followed by TOPOcloning and sequencing of multiple inserts.
To exclude Cas9 off-target activities, cleavage
detection was performed for seven predicted off-target
sites. No off-target effects were detectable (data not
shown).

Cell cycle analysis
Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle phase
distribution of JHH5 cell lines was performed 24 hours
after seeding. Cells were stained with propidium iodide
(PI) as previously described [46].
Cell cycle phase distribution was analyzed using a
Cytoflex 2.51 (Beckmann Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA)
flow cytometer and the CytExpert 1.2 software. Excitation
and emission wavelength were set to 488 nm and 585/42
nm, respectively.
