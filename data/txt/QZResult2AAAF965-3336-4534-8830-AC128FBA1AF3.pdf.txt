Abstract
Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma are two aggressive cancers
that affect bones and soft tissues in children and adolescents.
Despite multimodal therapy, patients with metastatic sarcoma
have a poor prognosis, emphasizing a need for more effective
treatment. We have shown previously that 2-methoxyestradiol
(2-ME), an antitumoral compound, induces apoptosis in
Ewing sarcoma cells through c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
(JNK) activation. In the present study, we provide evidence
that 2-ME elicits macroautophagy, a process that participates
in apoptotic responses, in a JNK-dependent manner, in Ewing
sarcoma and osteosarcoma cells. We also found that the
enhanced activation of JNK by 2-ME is partially regulated by
p53, highlighting the relationship of JNK and autophagy to
p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, we showed that 2-ME
up-regulates damage-regulated autophagy modulator
(DRAM), a p53 target gene, in Ewing sarcoma cells through
a mechanism that involves JNK activation. The silencing of
DRAM expression reduced both apoptosis and autophagy
triggered by 2-ME in Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma cells.
Our results therefore identify JNK as a novel mediator of
DRAM regulation. These findings suggest that 2-ME or other
anticancer therapies that increase DRAM expression or
function could be used to effectively treat sarcoma patients.

Introduction
Sarcomas are diverse tumors that arise from tissues of
mesenchymal origin and affect bone and soft tissues (1). Ewing
sarcomas are the second most common sarcoma of bone, after
osteosarcoma, in children and young adults (2). At the molecular
level, these tumors are usually characterized by unique chromosomal translocations that join the EWS gene to an ETS family
gene (3–5). The resulting fusion proteins are presumed to be
essential for maintaining oncogenesis of these tumors (6–8).
These tumors are clinically aggressive, highly metastatic, and
typically more refractory to conventional therapy than are
osteosarcomas. In fact, despite multimodal treatment programs,

the 5-year survival of patients with metastasis at diagnosis is
only 50%. This emphasizes the need for new therapeutic
approaches (9).
During the last decade, many studies have focused on apoptosis
because this process is the main mechanism by which anticancer
drugs induce tumor cell killing (10–12). Recently, macroautophagy
(hereafter called autophagy) has emerged as a key regulator of
death pathways (13–16). Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved
process in which cell engulfs cytoplasmic constituents within a
double-membrane vacuole (named autophagosome) and delivers
them to the lysosome for degradation (17–20). Autophagy contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis as a result of quality
control of both proteins and organelles. Under conditions of
metabolic stress, autophagy is induced to provide nutrients
and energy required for cell viability (18, 21). Besides cell survival
function, autophagy can be involved in the execution of cell
death through caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms (reviewed in refs. 10, 13, 14). Autophagy is positively
regulated by several tumor suppressor genes and its defect is
associated with increased tumorigenesis (19–23). Moreover, numerous studies have shown that apoptosis and autophagy share
some common signaling pathways and are mutually regulated
(15, 16). However, the precise network that regulates the crosstalk
between apoptosis and autophagy remains to be elucidated. For
example, although p53/damage-regulated autophagy modulator
(DRAM) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) proapoptotic signaling pathways have been shown previously to modulate autophagy, the connection between them has not yet been investigated
(24–30).
In this study, we report that 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME), an
antitumoral compound (31), induces a p53/JNK-dependent stimulation of autophagy in sarcoma cell lines. JNK signals autophagy, at
least in part, through the up-regulation of DRAM, which is a critical
signal for the induction of apoptosis triggered by 2-ME.

with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 10% decomplemented FCS. Saos (TetOnp53) and Saos (TetOn-DRAM) cells were grown at 37jC in 10% CO2 in
DMEM supplemented with 10% decomplemented FCS (25). TetOn cell
lines were induced by 24 h treatment with 1 Ag/mL doxycycline. For serum
and amino acid deprivation, cells were culture in Earle’s balanced salt
solution.
Electron microscopy. Cells were fixed for 1 h at 4jC in 1.6%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L Sörensen phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), washed
and fixed again in aqueous 2% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol,
embedded in Epon, and processed for electron microscopy with a Zeiss EM
902 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV in ultrathin sections stained
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
Immunofluorescence studies. Cells were fixed at 20jC with methanol
and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 before incubation with indicated
antibodies in PBS-0.2% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then stained with
rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories). Nuclei were counterstained for 30 min with Hoechst 33258.
The fluorescence of cells was examined using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence
microscope.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was done as described
previously (33). All of the experiments were repeated at least three times.
Representative autoradiograms are shown.
Coimmunoprecipitation assays. Cells were collected and lysed in
CHAPS lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L

www.aacrjournals.org

EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2% CHAPS] for 3 h at 4jC. The cleared lysates were
subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti–Beclin 1 antibody and protein
G Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting
by using antibodies against Bcl-2 and Beclin 1.
Detection of apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death was determined by
quantification of apoptotic nuclei (fragmentation and condensation of
nuclei) following Hoechst 33258 staining. A total of 300 to 500 nuclei were
counted for each sample.
Transfections of cells with plasmids or with small interfering
RNAs. The rate of autophagy was evaluated following transfection
of cells by using GFP-LC3 expression plasmids (kindly provided by
Dr. T. Yoshimori, National Institute of Genetics). In condition of stimulation
of autophagy, the presence of several intense fluorescent dots in cells is
indicative of the accumulation of autophagosomes. Transfections of
cells with plasmids were carried out by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies/Invitrogen). For each condition, the number of GFP-LC3 dots
per cell was determined under fluorescence microscope for at least 50 to
100 GFP-LC3–transfected cells.
Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) against Beclin 1, Atg7, p53, JNK, and
control siRNA were synthesized by Eurogentec. The siRNA oligos used to
target Beclin 1, Atg7, Dram, JNK, and p53 genes were previously validated
and described in the following articles (25, 26, 33, 34). siRNAs were
transfected using Oligofectamine (Life Technologies/Invitrogen) reagent as
described previously (33).

Isolation of RNA and real-time quantitative PCR assay. Total RNA
was extracted with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was
generated by reverse-transcription of 4 Ag total RNA using random primers
and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The primers for DRAM and ubiquitin
C4 were previously validated and described (25). Real-time quantitative
PCR was done in a LightCycler thermal cycler (Roche Diagnostics) as
described previously (33). For each cDNA, the DRAM mRNA levels were
normalized to Ubiquitin C mRNA levels. Results are expressed as ratio of
normalized DRAM mRNA levels in treated cells to that in untreated cells.
Statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated at least three
times. The results were expressed as mean F SD (n z 3). Student’s
distribution probability density function was used for calculation of
P values. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The software
used was Kaleidagraph.

Results
2-ME activates the autophagic flux and apoptosis in Ewing
sarcoma cells. We first tested the ability of 2-ME to induce
autophagy in Ewing sarcoma cells. We therefore looked for changes
in cellular distribution of autophagy marker LC3. On autophagy,
the cytoplasmic LC3 protein is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to yield a LC3-II form that localizes to pre-autophagosomal and autophagosomal membranes. As shown in Fig. 1A, 2-ME
induced a time-dependent accumulation of the LC3-II form in
Ewing sarcoma cells. This accumulation was enhanced in the
presence of leupeptin, a lysosomal protease inhibitor, supporting
the notion that 2-ME causes the activation of autophagy flux rather
than inhibition of either autophagosome maturation or lysosomal
degradation of autophagy cargo. The cellular localization of LC3
can be also evaluated following transfection of cells with the
fluorescent autophagy marker GFP-LC3. As illustrated in Fig. 1B,
2-ME caused an accumulation of a punctuated fluorescent pattern,
indicating the redistribution of LC3 to autophagic vacuoles,
whereas untreated cells manifested a diffuse staining, confirming
again that 2-ME activates the autophagic process in these cells.
Transmission electron microscopy experiments were also used to
detect autophagic vacuoles in cells. As shown in Fig. 1C,
2-ME–treated cells had an increased number of multimembrane
vacuoles per cell compared with untreated cells.
Because we showed previously that 2-ME induces apoptosis in
Ewing sarcoma cells (35), we next assessed if autophagy induced by
2-ME contributes to such a cell death. We inhibited the expression
of essential autophagy genes Beclin 1 and Atg7 by using specific
and previously validated siRNAs (33) and we evaluated apoptosis
induced by 2-ME either by quantification of apoptotic nuclei
following Hoechst 33258 staining or by evaluation of nucleosomal
DNA fragmentation in cells (data not shown). Apoptosis triggered
by 2-ME was significantly reduced following silencing of Beclin 1
and Atg7 (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results indicate that 2-ME
enhances the autophagic flux in Ewing sarcoma cells, a process
involved in apoptotic responses triggered by this compound.
2-ME–induced autophagy is regulated by p53 in Ewing
sarcoma and osteosarcoma cells. As shown in Fig. 2A (left), 2-ME
treatment of Ewing sarcoma cells caused a time-dependent
accumulation of p53 protein that is accompanied with increased
expression of p21, a transcriptional target of this protein. 2-ME also
promotes phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and its accumulation within

the nucleus, which is again indicative of functional transactivation of
p53 (Fig. 2A, right). To determine the function of p53 in the stimulation
of autophagy, we compared the accumulation of autophagosomes in
cells treated with 2-ME in the presence or absence of either PFT-a,
a pharmacologic antagonist of p53, or following siRNA-mediated
silencing of p53 (26). The increase in the abundance of LC3-II caused
by 2-ME was significantly reduced by PFT-a (Fig. 2B, left) and p53siRNA (Fig. 2B, right). Accordingly, GFP-LC3 transfection assays
revealed a marked decrease in the appearance of GFP-LC3 dots when
p53 protein expression was inhibited, indicating the requirement of
p53 for stimulation of autophagy (data not shown). It is worth noting
that both PFT-a alone or p53-specific siRNA alone enhanced
autophagy in cells, which is in accord with previous data showing
that the inhibition of cytoplasmic p53 (basal p53) induced autophagic
vacuolization in cells (26).
To confirm the role of p53 in the regulation of autophagy by 2-ME,
we used the Saos-2 osteosarcoma cell line null for endogenous
p53 that contains a doxycycline-inducible p53 transgene (TetOn-p53
cells). As shown in Fig. 2C (left), treatment with 2-ME caused the
accumulation of the LC3-II form only when the p53 transgene was
expressed but not in Saos cells null for endogenous p53, revealing
again the essential role of p53 in the stimulation of autophagy. As
observed for Ewing sarcoma cells, 2-ME caused an accumulation of
p53 phosphorylated at Ser15 within the nucleus of Saos (TetOn-p53)
cells, which argue for the transactivation of p53 (Fig. 2C, right). When
autophagy was prevented by silencing of the autophagy genes Beclin
1 and Atg7, 2-ME–induced apoptosis was markedly inhibited in cells
expressing the p53 transgene (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data
indicate that p53 participates in the enhanced autophagy induced by
2-ME treatment in both Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma cells.
JNK activation is regulated by p53 and is essential for
2-ME–induced autophagy and apoptosis in Ewing sarcoma
cells. We showed previously that 2-ME treatment of Ewing
sarcoma cells elicits JNK activation (35). To understand the
mechanisms involved in this process and its potential role in the
regulation of autophagy, we first investigate the link between p53
levels and JNK activation in response to 2-ME treatment of
sarcoma cells. To this purpose, we examined the profile of JNK
activation in Ewing sarcoma cells in the presence or absence of
PFT-a. As shown in Fig. 3A, inhibition of p53 by PFT-a in Ewing
sarcoma cells markedly reduced the activation of JNK induced by
2-ME as revealed by the evaluation of the phosphorylated forms
levels of the two isoforms of JNK1 and JNK2. These results indicate
that 2-ME–induced JNK activation is, at least partially, regulated by
the p53 in these cells. It has been shown recently that JNK
activation mediates multisite phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (at residues
T69, S70, and S87), which results in stimulation of autophagy by
disrupting the interaction between Bcl-2 and the autophagy
protein, Beclin 1 (27). We therefore examined whether 2-ME
treatment induces Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser70 in Ewing sarcoma
cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of Ewing sarcoma with
2-ME enhanced Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser70; this phosphorylation was markedly inhibited in the presence of either pharmacologic antagonist of JNK activation (SP600125) or p53 inhibitor
(PFT-a). These results show that, in Ewing sarcoma cells, 2-ME–
induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation requires JNK activation. This
response is dependent on p53 protein and is associated with
2-ME–mediated dissociation of Beclin 1/Bcl-2 complex (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Next, we questioned whether 2-ME–induced JNK activation is
implicated in the stimulation of autophagy and apoptosis. To this

purpose, we treated Ewing sarcoma cells with SP600125 before
the addition of 2-ME and evaluated the rates of autophagy and
apoptosis in these cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, inhibition of
JNK activation elicited a significant reduction in the number
of GFP-LC3 dots induced by 2-ME, supporting the argument that
JNK is required for the enhanced autophagy triggered by 2-ME
(Fig. 3B). On the other hand, 2-ME–induced apoptosis was
markedly reduced in Ewing sarcoma cells following inhibition of
JNK activation (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained in Saos cell
lines expressing p53 transgene, showing that JNK participates in

both autophagic and apoptotic signaling pathways triggered by 2ME (Supplementary Fig. S2). Taken together, these results indicate
that JNK activation is regulated by p53 and this response is critical
for both autophagy and apoptosis triggered by 2-ME.
DRAM is required for the stimulation of autophagy and
apoptosis triggered by 2-ME. The implication of DRAM in the
induction of autophagy by p53 in response to genotoxic stress has
been recently reported (25). To gain insight into the mechanism
involved in the p53/JNK-dependent regulation of autophagy, we
examined the possible role of DRAM in enhanced autophagy

triggered by 2-ME. We found that 2-ME caused a time-dependent
accumulation of DRAM protein in Ewing sarcoma cells, which as
expected was dramatically decreased when DRAM expression was
inhibited using a specific and previously validated DRAM siRNA
(ref. 25; Fig. 4A, top). To determine the implication of DRAM in
the regulation of autophagy in Ewing sarcoma cells, we examined
the abundance of the LC3-II form in 2-ME–treated cells in the
presence or absence of DRAM expression by using DRAM-specific
siRNA. As shown in Fig. 4A (bottom), the abundance of LC3-II
triggered by 2-ME was markedly reduced when DRAM expression
was inhibited, showing that DRAM is essential for the stimulation
of autophagy triggered by 2-ME. Moreover, silencing of DRAM
expression markedly reduced 2-ME–induced apoptosis in Ewing
sarcoma cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting the critical role of DRAM in
stimulation of apoptosis.

To confirm these results, we used the Saos-2 osteosarcoma cell
line that contains a doxycycline-inducible DRAM transgene (TetOnDRAM cells; ref. 25) and compared autophagic rates following 2-ME
treatment in the presence or absence of doxycycline. As shown in
Fig. 4C, the accumulation of LC3-II form was enhanced by 2-ME
treatment only in cells that express DRAM transgene (+Dox) but
not in those cells null for endogenous DRAM (-Dox), indicating a
strong dependency on DRAM for regulation of autophagy. In
addition, 2-ME can promote apoptosis only in cells that express
DRAM transgene (+Dox) but not in those cells that lack DRAM
(-Dox), indicating the essential role of DRAM in triggering
apoptosis by 2-ME (Fig. 4D). When autophagy was prevented by
silencing of the autophagy genes Beclin 1 and Atg7, 2-ME–induced
apoptosis in Saos (TetOn-DRAM) cells was significantly reduced
(Fig. 4D). Together, these results reveal that the enhanced DRAM

expression triggered by 2-ME is a key event in the stimulation of
autophagy and apoptosis in both Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma cells.
2-ME up-regulates DRAM through a mechanism that
involves JNK activation. Although JNK and DRAM have been
reported previously to induce autophagy in mammals (25, 27, 30,
36–38), the connection between these proteins has not yet been
investigated. To determine whether JNK regulates DRAM expression, we compared the level of DRAM (mRNA and protein) after
2-ME treatment of Ewing sarcoma cells in the presence of either a
pharmacologic antagonist of JNK or following silencing of JNK1
and JNK2 isoforms using JNK-specific siRNA (34). As revealed by
the real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 5A),
DRAM mRNA levels were enhanced following treatment of Ewing
sarcoma cells with 2-ME, suggesting that 2-ME either stabilizes
DRAM mRNA or increases its transcription level. Furthermore,
DRAM levels were markedly reduced when JNK activation was
inhibited, supporting the concept that JNK is involved in the
regulation of DRAM expression. 2-ME–induced DRAM protein

www.aacrjournals.org

expression in Ewing sarcoma cells was also significantly reduced
when JNK activation was inhibited by SP600125 (data not shown).
In a same way, 2-ME–induced DRAM protein expression was
decreased after partial inhibition of JNK using JNK-specific siRNA
(Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained in Saos (TetOn-p53) cells
expressing p53 transgene (Fig. 5C). These findings indicate that
2-ME up-regulates DRAM in Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma
in a JNK-dependent mechanism.

Discussion
Identification of new therapeutic strategies for promoting tumor
cell killing is an essential challenge of cancer research. In the
present study, we provide evidence that 2-ME, a novel anticancer
compound (31), promotes DRAM up-regulation in Ewing sarcoma
cells and this signal is critical for the induction of both autophagy
and apoptosis in these cells. Furthermore, we identified a novel
mechanism involved in the regulation of DRAM, uncovering the
role of JNK activation in this process.

JNK is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation,
differentiation, and death (39). This kinase can regulate the
expression of various genes by virtue of its ability to phosphorylate
and regulate the activity of specific transcription factors. On the
other hand, JNK plays an important role in the stabilization of

Figure 5. 2-ME up-regulates DRAM in a JNK-dependent manner. A, Ewing
sarcoma cells were treated with 20 Amol/L SP600125 for 1 h before treatment
with 2-ME (20 Amol/L) for the indicated times. Total RNA was extracted 16 h later
and the level of the DRAM mRNA was determined by real-time quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR. Results are expressed as ratio of normalized DRAM
mRNA in treated cells to that in untreated cells. Columns, mean; bars, SD (n = 3).

siRNA or JNK-specific siRNA. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with
or without 20 Amol/L 2-ME for 8 h. Equal amounts of protein from whole-cell
extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against
DRAM, JNK, and h-actin. C, Saos (TetOn-p53) cells were transfected with control
siRNA or JNK-specific siRNA. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated
with doxycycline for a further 24 h before the addition of 20 Amol/L 2-ME for 8 h.
Cellular extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using

target mRNA level as has been reported for LDL receptor and
interleukin-2 mRNAs (40, 41). Further studies are required to
define which of those two mechanisms are involved in JNKdependent accumulation of DRAM mRNA level in 2-ME–treated
sarcoma cells.
Previous results have shown that p53 and its target gene DRAM
are critical for the induction of both autophagy and death in cells
(24, 25, 42, 43). In accordance with these results, we found that
2-ME induces autophagy in a p53-dependent manner and that
JNK activation is at least partially regulated by p53, emphasizing
the link of p53 and autophagy to JNK activation. In turn, JNK
was shown to regulate the activity of p53 by inducing its
phosphorylation (39). Thus, JNK and p53 are mutually regulated,
which may constitute an amplifying loop of autophagic and
apoptotic responses. Under starvation conditions, JNK activation
results in phosphorylation of Bcl-2, which enhances autophagy by
disruption of the interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclin 1 (27). In a
similar way, we found that 2-ME promotes Bcl-2 phosphorylation
at Ser70 through a mechanism that involves JNK and p53 pathways.
These results are consistent with our finding showing that 2-ME
mediated dissociation of Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complex. However, it
remains to be elucidated whether and how Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complex
dissociation and DRAM up-regulation may cooperate together in
activating autophagy triggered by 2-ME. Recently, E2F-1 transcription factor, a key mediator of p53 pathway, was shown to regulate
the expression of several autophagic genes including DRAM (44).
Further studies are required to determine whether JNK cooperates
with E2F-1 transcription factor in the up-regulation of DRAM.
Depending on cellular context and stimuli, autophagy may
have cell survival or cell death functions (13, 15, 16). Our results
reveal the proapoptotic role of DRAM-mediated autophagy in
2-ME–treated sarcoma cells. These findings are consistent with
those of others showing the proautophagic and proapoptotic role of
DRAM (25) and are also in agreement with our previous study
showing the contribution of autophagy to apoptotic responses
induced by reactive oxygen species and tumor necrosis factor (33,
45). We also found that JNK is essential for 2-ME–induced apoptosis
in sarcoma cells. This is in accord with the concept that JNK
functions as a proapoptotic protein in numerous circumstances (46).
However, our findings are in contradiction with the results showing
that autophagy contributes solely to nonapoptotic cell death
induced by 2-ME (47). This discrepancy can be explained by
the fact that the concentration of 2-ME used in the latter article (47)
was 5-fold higher than that used in our study. Thus, the
concentration of drug might determine the type of autophagic cell
death. However, it will be worth investigating whether JNK activation
and DRAM have roles in the mechanism of nonapoptotic autophagic
cell death.
Ewing sarcoma is associated with mutation of tumor suppressors genes such as p53 and p16 in a significant group of patients.
Such molecular alterations are correlated with poor chemoresponses and are strong negative predictors of overall survival
of Ewing sarcoma patients (48). On the other hand, the suppression
of EWS-FLI1, a molecular hallmark of Ewing tumors, has been
shown to reactivate NOTCH-mediated p53-dependent cell cycle
arrest, suggesting the inhibitory effect of this chimeric protein on
p53 function (49). Identification of new therapeutic strategies that
bypass the p53 pathway in Ewing sarcoma cells is therefore critical.
From our results, we showed that 2-ME induces Ewing sarcoma
cell killing through a mechanism that involves activation of the
JNK/DRAM pathway. These results suggest that the activation of
