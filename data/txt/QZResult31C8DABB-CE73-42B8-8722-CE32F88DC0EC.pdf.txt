ABSTRACT
Background: Cervix cancer was the second most common cancer in female.
However, there was no network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing the efficacy of the
multiple chemotherapeutic interventions combined with radiation therapy in patients
after operation.
Methods: Randomized controlled trials were retrieved from PubMed, Embase and
Cochrane Library. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), incidence of
recurrence and distant metastasis were the main outcomes, particularly 5-year OS
and PFS were considered as primary outcomes. Furthermore, the hazard ratio (HR) or
odds ratio (OR) and their 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were extracted. The surface
under cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was also used in this NMA.
Results: A total of 39 eligible trials with 8,952 patients were included and 22
common chemotherapies were evaluated in this meta-analysis. For OS, cisplatin+fluo
rouracil+hydroxyurea, fluorouracil+mitomycin C, cisplatin and cisplatin+fluorouracil
were better than placebo. As for RFS, cisplatin+fluorouracil, fluorouracil+mitomycin
C, and cisplatin alone had the significant superiority compared with placebo. In terms
of incidence of recurrence, the optimal drug combination was cisplatin+ifosfamide
(0.93) based on SUCRA. Moreover, epirubicin (OR = 0.28, 95% CrI: 0.08-0.91) was
the only one had the distinguished potency in reducing the occurrence of distant
metastasis with a SUCRA rank probability of 0.88.
Conclusion: We recommended cisplatin+fluorouracil+hydroxyurea and
cisplatin+docetaxel for their good efficacy in long term survival. Meanwhile, the
combination of multiple drugs with different mechanisms worked better.

for 7.9% cancer cases and 7.5% cancer deaths in female
in 2012 [3, 4]. With the development of medical and
healthcare system, the average 5-year survival rate of
cervical cancer has reached 66% in developed countries,
yet less than half patients from developing countries could
live longer than 5 years [5, 6]. The international biological
study on etiology reported that human papillomavirus
(HPV) was responsible for about 93% invasive cervical
cancers [7]. Additionally, cigarette smoking, no matter
active or passive, long-term use of oral contraceptives and
multiple pregnancies are also high risk factors for cervix
cancer [8, 9].

INTRODUCTION
Cervix cancer is caused by abnormal proliferation
of cells with capacity of invasion, arising from the
lower, narrow end of uterus to vagina. According to the
definition of the National Cancer Institution of American
National Institutes of Health, cervix cancer contains two
main types, the squamous cell carcinoma originating from
thin, flat cells that line the cervix and the adenocarcinoma
arose from cells that make mucus and other fluids [1,
2]. And it is the second most frequent cancer occurred
in female worldwide, next to breast cancer, accounting

RESULTS

On the fundamental of clinical examination instead
of the surgical findings, the International Federation of
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) divides the cervix
cancer into five stages from 0 stage to IV stage [10]. Surgery
is a common treatment, while the specific operation and
scope for different FIGO stages are distinctive. Except for
conization and hysterectomy, one of the traditional surgeries
usually performed on stage IA microinvasive cancer, there
are many methods of fertility preservation for cervical
cancer, as radical vaginal trachelectomy [11]. Besides,
radiotherapy is also an available way to treat cervical cancer
and preserve reproductive function, splitting into external
and internal radiation therapy, which are given depending
on both type and stage of the cancer [12].
For further improvement of survival length and
decreasing the incidence of recurrence and distant
metastasis, chemotherapy is often combined with
radiotherapy after surgery through multiple mechanisms
exerting the synergistic effect. Cisplatin, fluorouracil,
hydroxyurea, bleomycin, ifosfamide and their combination
with other drugs are common medical choices with
different pharmacological reactions, and the combination
of chemo and radiotherapy could be further categorized
into neoadjuvant, adjuvant and concurrent therapy due to
whether the medication was performed before, after or
concurrent with the process of radiation [13–14].
Fortunately, regardless of the administration time
point, a large number of randomized control trials (RCTs)
assessing the efficacy and safety between different
chemotherapeutic agents after radiotherapy or radiotherapy
alone had been carried out and provided with sufficient
clinical data. However, some of them were contradicted to
each other. Two trials appraised the concurrent radiation
and cisplatin plus fluorouracil compared with radiation
alone. Morris et al. reported a significant superiority in
both overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival
(RFS), but the same outcomes of Kim et al.’s trial were
1.03 and 1.01 without statistically significance. Meanwhile,
although many meta-analyses (MA) existed, there was still
a lack of a conclusive treatment strategy for patients with
cervical cancer, and none of them conducted a network
meta-analysis (NMA) among variety of chemotherapies to
draw the best outcomes result in patients [15, 16].
As the first NMA on this subject, we synthesized
both direct and indirect data to compare the efficacy
among multiple common chemotherapies combined
with radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer after
surgery. OS, RFS, the incidence of recurrence, and distant
metastasis were used as the outcomes to assess cisplatin,
cisplatin+fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, fluorouracil alone,
cisplatin+ifosfamide, bleomycin+ifosfamide+cisplatin,
mitomycin C+fluorouracil, and other 14 chemotherapeutic
strategies. 5-year OS and PFS were considered as primary
outcomes. This multiple-treatment Bayesian meta-analysis
aimed to integrate the existed data and to draw a conclusion
to offer a guideline for the corresponding clinical practice.

Included studies
This NMA included 39 eligible trials with 8,952
patients involved, screened from the 412 identified
literatures from electronic database depending on the
inclusion and exclusion criteria, which were published
between March 1979 and October 2015 were included [13,
14, 17–53], and the efficacy of a total of 22 chemotherapies
were evaluated. Besides, 113 meta-analysis or systematic
reviews were retrieved through the keywords searching
on the Internet. The characteristics of patients, the details
of the specific interventions and the analyzed outcomes of
each trial were listed in Table 1. Among 39 eligible trials,
34 of them gave the data of OS, 36 trials showed the PFS,
34 pairs of comparisons involved the data of recurrence,
and the outcome of distant metastasis was analyzed in 24
trials. The directly compared connections among each
chemotherapeutic agent for each outcome were displayed
in Figure 1.

Overall survival (OS)
OS were treated as the primary outcomes. Since
1-year OS was a short-term evaluation index showing
no significant difference in most cases (Table 2),
3-year and 5-year OS were more reliable to reflect
their efficacies. The hazard ratio (HR) of placebo was
compared with 22 chemotherapies reported the HR of
3-year OS. As shown in the lower panel of Table 3,
cisplatin+ifosfamide+paclitaxel (HR = 2.14, 95% CrI:
1.1-4.17), cisplatin+fluorouracil+hydroxyurea (HR =
1.78, 95% CrI: 1.08- 2.93), cisplatin+paclitaxel (HR =
1.77, 95% CrI: 1.23-2.54), fluorouracil+mitomycin C
(HR = 1.75, 95% CrI: 1.04-2.95), cisplatin+ifosfamide
(HR = 1.71, 95% CrI: 1.26-2.33), cisplatin+mitolactol
(HR = 1.57, 95% CrI: 1.11-2.23), cisplatin+topotecan
(HR = 0.69, 95% CrI: 0.50-0.96), cisplatin (HR = 0.70,
95% CrI: 0.56-0.87), and cisplatin+fluorouracil (HR
= 1.32, 95% CrI: 1.07-1.64), these nine interventions
with 95% CrI excluded 1.00 had dramatic advantage on
improving the survival length of patients. Furthermore,
for 5-year OS in the lower panel of Table 4,
cisplatin+docetaxel (HR = 2.22, 95% CrI: 1.27-3.87), ci
splatin+fluorouracil+hydroxyurea (HR = 1.81, 95% CrI:
1.15-2.86), fluorouracil+mitomycin C (HR =1.67, 95%
CrI: 1.02-2.71), cisplatin (HR = 1.44, 95% CrI: 1.151.8), and cisplatin+fluorouracil (HR = 1.29, 95% CrI:
1.05-1.59) had statistically significance compared with
placebo. Results of ranking analysis in Table 5 suggested
that cisplatin+fluorouracil+hydroxyurea was efficacious
in 1-year and 5-year period. Another two favorable
interventions in 5-year OS were cisplatin+docetaxel and
fluorouracil+mitomycin C, suggested a good therapeutic
effect in long-term survival.

1.17-1.83), cisplatin (HR = 1.29, 95% CrI: 1.01-1.63)
possessed obvious strength in 5 year RFS. In Table 5,
ranking analysis showed that mitomycin C had excellent
performance in both short term and long term RFS.
Cisplatin+ifosfamide was also efficacious in 1-year and
3-year RFS and since the lack of 5-year RFS, we could
not estimate its long term efficacy. Cisplatin+docetaxel
and cisplatin+ fluorouracil+hydroxyurea had advantage in
improving 5-year RFS, which verified their outstanding
efficacy in long-term RFS.

As to 3-year and 5-year RFS, another primary

According to Tables 2–4, nine of them were noticeably
better than treatments without chemotherapy for 3-year

= 0.45, 95% CrI: 0.29-0.71), fluorouracil (OR = 0.51,
95% CrI: 0.26-0.96), and cisplatin (OR = 0.59, 95%
CrI: 0.37-0.93) were outstanding among them. Based
on their SUCRA illustrated in Figure 2 and Table 8,
cisplatin+ifosfamide (0.93) was the optimal combination,
cisplatin+ifosfamide+paclitaxel (0.91) was the second,
and the third one was cisplatin+docetaxel (0.74).

following two were bleomycin+cisplatin+ifosfamide
(0.83), and cisplatin+docetaxel (0.73).

Inconsistency test
The heat plots in Figures 3–4 provided a detailed
assessment of the inconsistency in this NMA. It appeared
that there was no significant inconsistency identified
within the net heat plot. Publication bias was visually
using the comparison-adjusted funnel plots (Figure 5). We
found no significant asymmetry patterns in funnel plots, so
we concluded there were no significant publication bias in
the included studies.

Distant metastasis
The potencies of reducing the occurrence of distant
metastasis were also estimated, and 15 interventions
had data in contrast with placebo, shown in Table 7.
Only epirubicin (OR = 0.28, 95% CrI: 0.08-0.91) was
significantly excellent in reducing the occurrence of
distant metastasis. This was also affirmed in our SUCRA
rank probability diagram, seen in Figure 2 and Table
8, since the SUCRA of epirubicin was 0.88, and the

or neoadjuvant treatment to patients with cervical cancer
after surgery, 39 RCTs or clinical trials covering 22
interventions were analyzed, in terms of OS, RFS, the
incidence of recurrence, and distant metastasis, in this
NMA. It is the first issue in this domain, which integrated
both the direct evidence and the indirect comparison
remedying the insufficiency of the traditional metaanalysis.

In accordance with results, the combination of two
or three medicines with diverse functional mechanisms had
better impact than mono-chemotherapy. On the basis of
biochemical mechanisms, relevant agents can be classified
into four types, drugs affecting the structure and function
of DNA, drugs interfering protein synthesis and function,
drugs intercalating DNA to interfere the transcription as
well as drugs used for metabolism inhibition.Statistically,

the dynamic equilibrium between tubulin and its dimer,
accelerate the assembling of tubulin and interfere with its
disassembly, therefore stop the cell cycle at G2/M phase
[62–64]. Epirubicin can insert the base pairs of DNA,
limiting the activity of transcriptase to influence the
synthesis of mRNA, especially in the S and M phase of
cell cycle [65]. Thus, the combination of multiple drugs
with distinctive anti-cancer mechanisms would tend to
exhibit superior efficacy especially to reduce the drug
resistance during the long term administration.
This NMA assessed the efficacy of 22
chemotherapeutic treatments, containing nearly all clinical
regular prescription in the aspects of 1-year, 3-year, and
5-year OS and RFS, as well as the incidence of recurrence
and distant metastasis. However, there is still insufficiency
that cannot be denied. First, the inclusion trials were
limited, and 13 strategies were emerged only once, the
inherent error of which were brought in this NMA. Next,

the dose and delivery method of each agents were not
considered to be an impact factor, but these factors did
have influence on their efficacy. The discrepancy on 5-year
RFS of the trials between Pearcey and Wong might be
caused by the dosage of cisplatin [39]. Moreover, though
the FIGO stages of subjects were listed, there was no
discrimination in the course of data analysis. Nevertheless,
in the clinical practice, the conditions of patients had an
important impact on treatment results, including periaortic
and pelvic lymph node status, patient age, performance
status, bilateral disease and clinical stage [66]. For
instance it is evident that the tumor size had the direct
relation to the occurrence of metastasis and recurrence [67,
68]. Therefore, more authentic trials are needed and on the
basis of colossal data, the particular subgroup analysis can
be performed.
Overall, in consideration of the results of this NMA,

and fluorouracil+mitomycin C, were outstanding in
prolonging the length of OS, whilemitomycin C, cispla
tin+fluorouracil+hydroxyurea and cisplatin+docetaxel
had good performance in RFS. Integrating both OS
and RFS data, cisplatin+fluorouracil+hydroxyurea
and cisplatin+docetaxel were highly recommended
as first tier chemotherapies based on their equally
preferable performance in long term. The first three with
excellent performance in reducing the recurrence were
cisplatin+ifosfamide, cisplatin+ifosfamide+paclitaxel, and
cisplatin+docetaxel, in contrast to epirubicin which were
beneficial to the significant decrease of distant metastasis.
However, it should be noted that the individual conditions
of patient should be taken into account thoroughly in
clinical application.

The basic features of this study, including author,
year of publication, country, and the efficacy outcomes,
were extracted from each eligible trial [69]. To assess
the prognosis of chemotherapy aiming to cervix cancer,
OS and RFS are the common outcomes. And quoting the
interpretation from the NCI, OS indicates the length of
time from the start of the chemotherapy for the cervix
cancer, that patients diagnosed with the disease are still
alive; and RFS means the length of time during and after
the chemotherapy of the cervix cancer, that a patient lives
without the diagnosed cancer. Except for the data given
directly, the outcomes can also be extracted from the OS
and RFS curves, the cumulative percentage versus time
after chemotherapy administration. The incidence of
recurrence and distant metastases were also evaluated as
efficacy predictors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search strategy

Statistical analysis

To obtain the relevant trial data, we searched
electronic database PubMed, Embase and Cochrane
Library for RCTs and clinical trials, regardless of
the diversity of language, with the following key
terms and their synonyms combined, “cervix cancer”,
“radiotherapy”, “surgery”, and among “chemotherapy”,
“concurrent chemotherapy”, “neoadjuvant chemotherapy”,
“adjuvant chemotherapy”, and specific drugs, such as
“cisplatin”, “fluorouracil”, “hydroxyurea” were included.
Meanwhile, we also examined the reference lists of all the
existed meta-analyses and systemic reviews, to guarantee
the sample size of tested interventions. And all these work
mentioned above were done by two reviewers individually.

Based on the connection among treatments, four
network plots on recurrence, distant metastasis, OS and
RFS were drawn. The heterogeneity of fixed-effects model
among each study effect was calculated through Cochran’s
Q and I squared statistic, which were presented in the net
heat plots [70, 71]. Generally, if Ph < 0.05 or I2 > 50%, it
implied that a significant heterogeneity was existed, and
then the fixed-effects model would be replaced by the
random-effects model.
STATA 12.0 software and WinBUGS software were
used for, which showed us the combination of direct and
indirect evidence. In this NMA, we synthesized the direct
and indirect evidence on 1-year, 3-year, 5-year OS and
RFS, recurrence and distant metastasis. HR or OR with
their 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were applied to evaluate
the relative efficacy for specific comparison. To sort the
chemotherapies according to their efficacies on recurrence
and distant metastasis, the surface under the cumulative
ranking curve (SUCRA) was applied, cumulating the
percentages of each intervention with assuming the
best, the second best and so on. And then, the optimal
treatment would have the highest cumulative probability
[72]. Furthermore, the heat plots for each outcome were
performed to reflect the contribution of direct evidence
to the network comparison and their inconsistency.
Moreover, the publication bias on recurrence and distant
metastasis were considered through the funnel plots,
standard error of effect size versus the effect size centered
at comparison-specific pooled effect.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
All the included trials must meet the listed criteria:
(i) at least one of the involved interventions should
be used to treat the cervix cancer of patients; (ii) the
interventions could include concurrent chemotherapy,
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy,
but should be combined with radiotherapy and after
surgery, while the strategy of radiotherapy and surgery
were no limitations; (iii) the overall survival (OS) or
the recurrence-free survival (RFS) should be compared
between two interventions or interventions and placebo.
Besides, although some trials satisfied the inclusion
conditions, since they carried out between different
methods of administration of the identical drug or the
intervention they investigated which cannot form a loop,
they were still excluded eventually. The trials included
should also meet PRISMA guidelines. According to these
criteria, two reviewers screened titles and abstracts of all
retrieved articles, and the full texts would be examined
respectively when necessary. And any arguments would
be solved under discussion by the panel.
