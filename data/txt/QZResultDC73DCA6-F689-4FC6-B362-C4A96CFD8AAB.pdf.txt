Abstract
The antiangiogenic protein angiostatin inhibits ATP synthase
on the endothelial cell surface, blocking cellular proliferation.
To examine the specificity of this interaction, we generated
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against ATP synthase.
mAb directed against the B-catalytic subunit of ATP synthase
(MAb3D5AB1) inhibits the activity of the F1 domain of ATP
synthase and recognizes the catalytic B-subunit of ATP
synthase. We located the antibody recognition site of
MAb3D5AB1 in domains containing the active site of the Bsubunit. MAb3D5AB1 also binds to purified Escherichia coli F1
with an affinity 25-fold higher than the affinity of angiostatin
for this protein. MAb3D5AB1 inhibits the hydrolytic activity of
F1 ATP synthase at lower concentrations than angiostatin.
Like angiostatin, MAb3D5AB1 inhibits ATP generation by ATP
synthase on the endothelial cell surface in acidic conditions,
the typical tumor microenvironment where cell surface ATP
synthase exhibits greater activity. MAb3D5AB1 disrupts tube
formation and decreases intracellular pH in endothelial cells
exposed to low extracellular pH. Neither angiostatin nor
MAb3D5AB1 showed an antiangiogenic effect in the corneal
neovascularization assay; however, both were effective in the
low-pH environment of the chicken chorioallantoic membrane
assay. Thus, MAb3D5AB1 shows angiostatin-like properties
superior to angiostatin and may be exploited in cancer
chemotherapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4716–24]

Introduction
Tumor growth is dependent on new vascular growth (1–3), and
angiostatin is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis (4, 5). Angiostatin
inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and migration, inducing
apoptosis in vitro (4, 5). Angiostatin inhibits ATP synthase on the
surface of endothelial and tumor cells (6–9). ATP synthase is a
transmembrane enzyme found not only in the plasma membrane
of bacteria and the inner mitochondrial membrane (10) but also on
the surface of endothelial and tumor cells, where it synthesizes ATP
(6, 11–13). The enzyme catalyzes ATP synthesis coupled to an
electrochemical gradient and ATP hydrolysis-driven proton translocation. The enzyme complex is composed of a soluble F1 formed
from five subunits (a3, h3, g, y, and q) and the membrane-bound F0
forming the proton channel (Fig. 1A; ref. 14). On the cell surface, F1

is oriented extracellularly, localizing ATP synthesis or hydrolysis to
the external cell surface (6–8, 15). Transmembrane F0 allows
protons moving through the channel to be extruded from the cell.
Three a- and h-subunits alternate in a hexagonal arrangement
around a central cavity containing the g-subunit. The a- and
h-subunits are structurally similar, each formed from three
domains. The apical NH2-terminal domains interact to form a h
barrel (Fig. 1B and C). The central domains contain the nucleotidebinding sites, which are catalytic in the h-subunit, but not the asubunit (Fig. 1C). The third and COOH-terminal domains consist of
a helices, which in the h-subunit interact with the rotating
g-subunit (14).
Inhibition of cell surface ATP synthase by angiostatin reduces
cellular proliferation, and in combination with low extracellular pH
(pHe), intracellular acidification and cytotoxicity ensue (6–8, 16–
18). Similar results were achieved with polyclonal antibodies
targeting ATP synthase (6–8, 12). These studies suggest that
angiostatin, or anti-ATP synthase antibodies, prevent intracellular
pH (pHi) regulation by cell surface ATP synthase under conditions
of acidosis by inhibiting proton translocation across the membrane-embedded protein. The resultant intracellular acidosis
renders the cells susceptible to cell death (9).
We have identified a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed
against the catalytic h-subunit of F1 ATP synthase that binds and
potently inhibits ATP synthase. The antibody recognition site lies
in a region containing the active site of the h-subunit. At low pHe,
this antibody inhibits endothelial cell tube differentiation to a
greater extent than angiostatin. Like angiostatin, this antibody
causes deregulation of pHi in endothelial cells at low pHe, providing
a potential mechanism for its effects on endothelial cells. In vivo
studies show antiangiogenic activity of the antibody in the
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, in which blood vessel
growth occurs in an acidic environment similar to the tumor
microenvironment. Conversely, the antibody does not inhibit
angiogenesis in the normal physiologic pH environment of the
rat corneal neovascularization assay.
Whereas angiostatin is relatively unstable with a serum half-life
of 15 min (8), antibodies are stable with a typical half-life of f20
days (8, 19). Humanized mAbs are well accepted as pharmaceutical
agents with excellent yields and high affinity (16), raising the
possibility of an angiostatin-mimetic mAb as a cancer therapeutic.

Figure 1. Relative position of the
h-subunit within F1 ATP synthase. The
domains (color ) of the catalytic h-subunit of
human F1 ATP synthase are represented in
the context of the three-dimensional
crystallographic structure of bovine F1 ATP
synthase (PDB ID: 1BMF; gray scale ) in
side profile (A) and from a bird’s eye view
looking downward at the alternating h
barrels of the first domains of a- and
h-subunits within F1 ATP synthase (B ).
The domains of a h-subunit (C ) in the
ATP-bound conformation are identified
individually within an isolated h-subunit;
domain 1 (red ), domain 2 (green ), and
domain 3 (blue ). The breakpoints for the
domains were chosen as follows: domain 1
forms a clearly delineated h barrel motif;
domain 2 was separated from domain 3 by
a flexible loop, with Met#408 chosen as the
breakpoint between domains to facilitate
soluble expression of individual domains 2
and 3. ATP synthesis and hydrolysis occur
in domain 2, which contains the active
nucleotide-binding site within the
h-subunit. Domains 2 and 3 undergo
conformational changes during enzymatic
catalysis, with domain 3 interacting with the
rotating g-subunit extending the length of
the F1 component, whereas domain 1
remains relatively fixed in interactions with
the h-barrel domains of adjacent
a-subunits (gray ) forming a hexameric
tether of h barrels as seen in (B ).

human heart mitochondria (21) with the following hybridoma partners:
immune splenocytes derived from a murine F1 hybrid of BALB/cJ and SLJ/J
mice, and P3X63-AG8.653 myelomas. Screening was accomplished by
Western blot, first to identify anti-complex V mAbs; second, sucrose gradient
material to confirm anti-complex V mAbs; third, antigen identification by
mass spectrometry; and fourth, immunocytochemical detection by the mAb
of mitochondria in cultured fibroblasts. Recombinant human angiostatin
was from Entremed. Fertilized chicken eggs were from Carolina Biological
Supply. Fisher F344 female rats (8–10 weeks old, f150 g) were from National
Cancer Institute-Frederick. Recombinant human basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF) was from R&D Systems. Sucrose octasulfate aluminum
complex (sucralfate) and hydron polymer (poly2-hydroxylethylmethacrylate)
were from Sigma.
Cells. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were
obtained from umbilical cords (22) under an Institutional Review Board–
exempt protocol, as discard with no patient identifiers. HUVECs, passages 2
to 4, were grown in M199 with 20% FCS, 0.01% heparin (Sigma), 1.5%
endothelial cell growth supplement (Collaborative Biochemicals), 1%
penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine.
ELISA binding studies. Binding studies were done with purified,
recombinant E. coli F1 adsorbed onto Immulon 4 96-well plates (Thermo
Labsystems). Plates were coated with protein (0.75 Ag/well) in 50 AL of
0.1 mol/L NaHCO3 (pH 9.6) and incubated for 20 h at 4jC. Nonspecific
sites were blocked by Superblock (Pierce) incubation for 1 h at room
temperature. Increasing amounts of MAb3D5AB1 were added in a 50 AL
final volume for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed and
incubated with rat anti-mouse IgG1 biotin conjugate (1:4,500 dilution;

www.aacrjournals.org

Southern Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were developed with
TMB substrate (Sigma; ref. 6). Control studies were done in triplicate in the
absence of ATP synthase to detect nonspecific binding. These values were
averaged and subtracted from the averaged triplicate samples in the
presence of ATP synthase. As a positive control, plates were coated with
recombinant human h-subunit. Secondary rat anti-mouse antibody in the
absence of primary antibody served as a further negative control for
nonspecific binding.
Cell surface ATP generation assay. HUVEC P4 cells (70,000 per well)
in 96-well plates were grown at 37jC, 5% CO2 overnight. Cells were placed
in serum-free medium and treated with MAb3D5AB1, piceatannol (Sigma),
or medium alone for 30 min at 37jC, 5% CO2 to achieve pHe 7.2 or 17%
CO2 to achieve pHe 6.7. Piceatannol, a known ATP synthase inhibitor,
served as a positive control and to determine the component of cell
surface ATP generation attributable to ATP synthase. Cells were incubated
with ADP for 20 s, and supernatants were immediately removed and
assayed for ATP production by CellTiterGlo luminescence assay (Promega;
ref. 23).
Cloning of the B-subunit of ATP synthase and its domains. HUVEC
mRNA was isolated and reverse transcribed using random primers into
single-stranded cDNA. The h-subunit (Fig. 1) was PCR amplified using
specific primers with an NH2-terminal 6-His tag, as were domains 1, 2, and
3, domains 1 to 2, and domains 2 to 3 (Fig. 2A). To generate fusion proteins
containing the NH2-terminal 6-His tag with the domains of the h-subunit,
primers were designed to introduce a NdeI restriction site at the 5¶ end and
an XhoI site at the 3¶ COOH-terminal end (Table 1). Domain boundaries
were determined based on structural motifs (Fig. 1C). Domain 1 included 50

of recombinant proteins, as expression of the mature sequence was not
possible. PCR products purified from 1.5% Tris-acetate/EDTA agarose gel
using GFX PCR DNA and gel band purification kit (Amersham) were
subcloned into pMOSBlue vector by blunt-end ligation using the pMOSBlue
Blunt-End Cloning kit (Amersham). Competent E. coli DH5a (Life
Technologies) were transformed with 1 AL ligation mixture/100 AL cells,
plated on LB-ampicillin (100 Ag/mL) and tetracycline (15 Ag/mL) agarose
plates, and grown overnight at 37jC. Colonies were screened for inserts
with NdeI and XhoI (New England Biolabs) digestion followed by gel
purification. The subcloned inserts were ligated into NdeI- and XhoIdigested pET24d vector (Novagen) using the Clonables kit (Novagen).
Competent E. coli Novablue cells (Novagen) were transformed with ligation
mixture and grown on LB-kanamycin agarose plates, and colonies were
screened for insertion by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing.

Purification of the B-subunit of ATP synthase and its domains.
Competent Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) containing tRNAs recognizing rare codons were transformed with pET24d vector containing h-subunit
or its domains, plated on LB-kanamycin and chloramphenicol agarose
plates, and grown overnight at 37jC. Then, 2.5 mL LB, containing 30 Ag/mL
kanamycin and 34 Ag/mL chloramphenicol, was inoculated with one colony
and grown at 37jC, 200 rpm, to A 600 nm of 0.54, and stored overnight at 4jC.
A 50 mL culture (LB, 30 Ag/mL kanamycin, 34 Ag/mL chloramphenicol) was
inoculated with 2 mL of the noninduced overnight culture and grown at
37jC, 250 rpm, to A 600 nm of 0.60. Isopropyl thio-h-D-galactosidase was
added to a final concentration of 1 mmol/L and cultures were grown an
additional 2.5 h at 37jC, 250 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at
5,000  g for 5 min and stored at 20jC. Lysates were prepared by
denaturing with 8 mol/L urea for all proteins except h-domain 3, which was
prepared under native conditions. Lysates were purified using Ni-NTA His

acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) in medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum at 37jC, 5% CO2 (25, 26). After steady-state readings were
established in medium (pH 7.4), it was removed, and 1 mL medium
(pH 6.7) with or without MAb3D5Ab1 (10 Ag/mL final concentration)
was introduced. Experiments were repeated at least twice, with three to
five measurements per field. pHi was obtained from the whole emission
spectra emitted by the cells and collected on an inverted microscope
(Nikon Diaphot, Nikon, Inc.; refs. 17, 18). Calibration procedures are as
described (27); however, 140 wavelengths (whole fluorescence spectra)
were used to calculate pHi (17, 18, 25, 28).
pHe measurements. pHe measurements in the CAM assay were made
using a Sentron ISFET pH meter, designed for use with solids and viscous
materials. Corneal micropocket pH measurements were made with a
Fisher accumet pH meter equipped with a 21-gauge protected needle
microelectrode for pH and a flexible microreference electrode from
Microelectrodes, Inc.
Rat corneal neovascularization assay. Animal experiments were done
as approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. The rat corneal neovascularization assay was done as described
(29). Sustained-release pellets contained equal volumes of Hydron (12% w/v
in ethanol) and a solution of bFGF (100 ng), sucralfate (100 Ag), and drug or
PBS (negative control). MAb3D5AB1 was used at 650 ng/pellet and
angiostatin at 20 Ag/pellet. Vascular area density and average vessel length
were measured by an investigator blind to treatment assignment using
ImageJ software (29).
Chicken CAM assay. The CAM assay was done as described (30). Test
compounds (bFGF, angiostatin F bFGF, MAb3D5AB1 F bFGF, or PBS) were
dried onto a sterile quarter of a 13-mm Thermanox disc (Nunc) and placed
onto the CAM on day 10. After 70 F 4 h, CAMs were photographed and
analyzed by an investigator blind to treatment assignment.

NOTE: Sequences are based on the cDNA of human F1 ATP synthase
(protein accession no. X03559, italics). Restriction enzyme sites, in
bold, represent for 5¶ end primers, an NdeI cleavage site, and for 3¶
primers, an XhoI site. Primers read from 5¶ to 3¶ with respect to cDNA.
For constructs spanning two domains, the appropriate combinations
of primers were used. For example, for domains 2 and 3, the 5¶ primer
for domain 2 was used in conjunction with the 3¶ primer for domain 3.

Bind Resin columns (Novagen) and the resulting proteins were dialyzed
against PBS (pH 7.0).
Western blotting. Purified, recombinant h-domain proteins (f1 Ag)
under reducing conditions were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF; Roche). Membranes were blocked
overnight at 4jC, incubated with MAb3D5AB1 at 2.5 mg/mL for 2 h at
room temperature, and washed. Membranes were incubated with
antimouse alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma), washed, and developed
with 5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl-phosphate nitroblue tetrazolium. To insure
that the secondary detection antibody did not contribute to background
detection, a membrane was developed with secondary antibody alone. To
confirm transfer of all protein domains to the membrane, a post-transfer
membrane was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.
ATP synthase F1 activity assay. Fresh bovine heart mitochondria were
sonicated to yield submitochondrial particles. F1 was separated from
membrane-bound F0 by chloroform extraction and purified (6). Purified F1
exhibits ATP hydrolytic activity alone, as ATP synthesis requires association
with F0 to couple the proton gradient across F0 with the rotational motion
of F1. Therefore, we measured F1 ATP hydrolytic activity by coupling ADP
generation to NADH oxidation via pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase reactions (24).
Fluorescence microscopy. HUVECs were plated in Matrigel-coated (BD
Biosciences) eight-well slides at a density of 70% confluency. Cells were
washed, fixed under nonpermeabilized conditions, and blocked (17). Cells
were incubated with a mAb to ATP synthase (1:50 in DPBS) for 1 h/37jC.
Cells were washed, incubated with a Cy3 secondary antibody, and visualized
along with identification of endothelial cell nuclei as described (17). For
each treatment, 10 fields of cells were examined.
HUVEC tube formation on Matrigel. Plates (Collaborative Biomedicals)
were coated with Matrigel at 4jC (300 AL/well at 15 mg/mL) and incubated
at 37jC/30 min. HUVECs (50,000 per well) were plated and incubated for
6 h in the presence or absence of MAb3D5AB1 (10–100 Ag/mL) in normalor low-pH medium at 37jC, 5% CO2 to allow tube formation. Cells were
fixed, stained, and quantified in triplicate (17, 18).
pHi measurements. pHi was measured by fluorescence in HUVEC
(17, 18). Cells were incubated for 15 min with 9 Amol/L carboxy snarf-1

Results
MAb3D5AB1 binding studies. We have identified ATP synthase
on the endothelial cell surface (6, 7). We now show that MAb3D5AB1
targeting the human h-subunit also recognizes ATP synthase on
nonpermeabilized HUVEC as visualized by fluorescence microscopy
(Fig. 3A and B). MAb3D5AB1 binds to purified, recombinant E. coli
F1 in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner (Fig. 3C).
Human and E. coli ATP synthase exhibit 70% homology in the
a-subunit (SWISS-PROT accession nos. P25705 and P00822,
respectively) and 80% homology in the h-subunit (P06576 and
P00824). Background binding of MAb3D5AB1 to BSA-coated wells
was comparable with the baseline, indicating that MAb3D5AB1
binds specifically to F1. Apparent dissociation constants [K d(app)]
were determined from double-reciprocal Scatchard plots of the
binding data (Fig. 3C, inset). The K d(app) for MAb3D5AB1 binding to
purified E. coli F1 is 16 nmol/L compared with 405 nmol/L for
angiostatin binding to E. coli F1 (6). Thus, MAb3D5AB1 targets the
angiostatin receptor ATP synthase with a binding affinity 25-fold
greater than angiostatin.
Mapping of the MAb3D5AB1 antibody recognition site. For
epitope mapping, a series of expression constructs of human F1
domains were generated. These included the a-subunit, h-subunit,
individual domains 1, 2, and 3 of the h-subunit, and a construct
comprising domains 2 and 3 (Fig. 2B). The construct spanning
domains 1 and 2 could not be expressed. By Western blot assays,
MAb3D5AB1 strongly detected the h-subunit domains 2 and 3 and
full-length recombinant h-subunit (Fig. 2C). MAb3D5AB1 did not
recognize either the individual second or third domains of the
h-subunit (Fig. 2C) nor the a-subunit of F1, included as a negative
control (data not shown). The remainder of the mAbs assessed
recognized the a-subunit but not the h-subunit of F1 (data not
shown). These results show that MAb3D5AB1 targets the catalytic

Figure 3. Binding studies of MAb3D5AB1 to HUVEC or to purified E. coli F1
ATP synthase. A, MAb3D5AB1 detects F1F0 ATP synthase on HUVEC.
F1F0 ATP synthase on nonpermeabilized HUVEC was detected by
immunostaining with MAb3D5AB1 to the h-subunit of F1F0 ATP synthase
and visualization with fluorescence microscopy. B, HUVEC immunostained

Representative images (n = 10). C and D, an ELISA was done to determine
concentration-dependent binding of mAb MAb3D5AB1 (C ), or angiostatin (D ),
to a constant amount of F1 ATP synthase. Each well was coated with 0.75 Ag
recombinant E. coli F1 ATP synthase before addition of increasing amounts
of antibody or angiostatin. Average background binding of secondary antibody
alone from controls in triplicate was subtracted from the average absorbance
in triplicate with MAb3D5AB1 or angiostatin. Insets, apparent dissociation
constants [K d(app)] were determined from double-reciprocal Scatchard
plots of the binding data.

h-subunit of ATP synthase and binds within the region of the two
domains involved in subunit activity.
MAb3D5AB1 inhibits purified bovine F1 ATP synthase
activity. ATP synthase holoenzyme catalyzes both the forward
ATP synthesis and the reverse ATP hydrolysis reactions. Purified
F1 is restricted to catalyzing ATP hydrolysis. The ATP hydrolytic
activity of purified bovine F1 was measured by an enzymatic assay,
in which a decrease in A 340 nm indicates ATP hydrolysis (24).
MAb3D5AB1 inhibited purified ATP hydrolysis in a dose-dependent
manner with maximal inhibition of f60% at the highest antibody
concentration assessed (40 Ag/mL, f0.27 Amol/L; Fig. 4A). None of
the mAbs recognizing the a-subunit affected enzymatic activity of
F1 ATP synthase (data not shown). Angiostatin at a much higher
concentration (10 Amol/L) achieves comparable inhibition (6).
Neither mouse IgG, DPBS, nor assay buffer affected activity.
Angiostatin exhibits enhanced activity on endothelial cells at pHe
6.7 (8, 17, 18). Therefore, we examined the effect of low pHe on the
ability of MAb3D5AB1 to inhibit ATP synthase. There was no
difference in the inhibitory activity of MAb3D5AB1 on purified
ATPase activity at pHe 6.8 compared with pHe 7.2. Thus, mAb
MAb3D5AB1 to the h-subunit inhibits ATP synthase activity with
greater potency than angiostatin.
MAb3D5AB1 inhibits ATP generation on the cell surface of
HUVEC at low pHe. MAb3D5AB1 inhibits, in a dose-dependent
manner, ATP generation by ATP synthase on HUVEC exposed to
low pHe compared with HUVEC at physiologic pHe (Fig. 4B). This
pH dependency agrees with previous findings that angiostatin and
a polyclonal antibody to ATP synthase inhibited tumor cell surface
ATP synthase to a greater degree under conditions of acidosis
(6, 12). At low pHe and comparable concentration, MAB3D5AB1

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

inhibited ATP synthesis at the endothelial cell surface to a greater
extent than polyclonal antibody to ATP synthase or angiostatin
(12). These results show that MAb3D5AB1 inhibits the activity of
endothelial cell surface ATP synthase on intact cells with selective
potency at low pHe.
MAb3D5AB1AB1 affects pHi at low pHe. To determine whether
MAb3D5AB1, like angiostatin (8, 12, 17, 18), interferes with pHi
regulation during acute extracellular acidification, HUVECs were
challenged with a pHe decrease from 7.3 to 6.7 in the presence or
absence of MAb3D5AB1 (10 Ag/mL; f67 nmol/L; Fig. 4C),
consistent with the concentration used in the tube formation
assay. As a negative control, cells were exposed to extracellular
acidification without antibody. Extracellular acidification resulted
in pHi decrease from 7.17 F 0.03 to 6.92 F 0.01, a net pHi decrease
of 0.25. In cells subjected to extracellular acidification with
MAb3D5AB1, pHi decreased to a greater extent, from 7.27 F
0.004 to 6.86 F 0.004, indicating a net change in pHi of 0.41. Thus,
the change in pHi due to MAb3D5AB1 alone was 0.16. In
comparison, a pHi decrease of a comparable amount (0.45) to that
observed from MAb3D5AB1 (10 Ag/mL; f67 nmol/L), requires a
much higher concentration of angiostatin (30 Ag/mL; f1 Amol/L;
ref. 18). MAb3D5AB1 therefore affects the pHi of endothelial cells
in a manner similar to angiostatin, but to a greater extent.
MAb3D5AB1 inhibits HUVEC tube formation at low pHe.
Angiostatin disrupts endothelial cell tube formation at low
pHe (18); therefore, we examined whether MAb3D5AB1 would
act similarly. Endothelial cell tube formation was inhibited by
10 Ag/mL (f67 nmol/L) MAb3D5AB1 at pHe 6.7, whereas the
antibody had no effect at pHe 7.4 (Fig. 5A). At pHe 6.7, tube
formation was inhibited by f60% in the presence of 10 Ag/mL
MAb3D5AB1 compared with cells treated with MAb3D5AB1 at pHe
7.4 (Fig. 5B). Six other mAbs generated to F1 recognizing the asubunit did not significantly inhibit tube formation at low pHe
compared with the control of low pHe alone (Fig. 5B). Previously,
we showed that angiostatin at 10 Ag/mL (f320 nmol/L) inhibited
tube formation at pHe 6.7 by f33% (18). MAb3D5AB1 induces a
greater inhibitory effect on endothelial cell tube formation than
angiostatin at low pHe.
MAb3D5AB1AB1 inhibits the development of neovasculature in the CAM assay but not the rat corneal neovascularization assay. To examine the antiangiogenic effect of MAb3D5AB1
in vivo, the antibody was tested in the chicken CAM assay and the
rat corneal micropocket assay. In the CAM assay, blood vessel
growth was stimulated with bFGF, and the effect of applying
MAb3D5AB1 or angiostatin to the CAM was observed (Fig. 6A–C).
Treatment with either of these compounds inhibited angiogenesis,
as evidenced by decreased vessel ingrowth and branching visible on
the treated area of these CAMs. At an f18-fold lower molar dose,
MAb3D5AB1 showed an equivalent antiangiogenic effect relative to
angiostatin (Fig. 6D). Negative controls included eggs treated with
PBS, MAb3D5AB1, or angiostatin without bFGF. These treatments
had neither an angiogenic nor an antiangiogenic effect on the CAM
(data not shown). Thus, neither angiostatin nor the antibody
inhibited normal vessel development that occurs in the CAM, but
both inhibited bFGF-dependent neovascularization. These findings
are consistent with results of the human clinical trial of angiostatin,
in which normal vasculature was not affected by exogenously
administered angiostatin (31).
In the rat corneal micropocket assay, bFGF-stimulated corneal
neovascularization was not inhibited by treatment with MAb3D5AB1 or angiostatin. Average vessel length actually showed a trend

toward increased length in corneas treated with bFGF+MAb3D5AB1
(P = 0.09) or bFGF+angiostatin (P = 0.12) relative to bFGF alone,
but the difference was not statistically significant. There was also
no statistically significant difference between the vascular area
density of bFGF-treated corneas versus corneas treated with bFGF+
angiostatin (P = 0.66). The vascular area density was significantly
higher in corneas treated with bFGF+MAb3D5AB1 than in corneas
treated with bFGF alone (P = 0.04).
Because the effects of angiostatin and the antibody are pH
dependent, we hypothesized that the pH of the rat cornea may be
too high to achieve a significant antiangiogenic effect with these
drugs. We used a pH microelectrode to determine the pH inside the
corneal pocket before implanting the Hydron pellet. The corneal
pH measured 7.47 F 0.17 (n = 5), which is well above the optimal
pH range for angiostatin and MAb3D5AB1. We repeated these pH
measurements 6 days after implantation of the pellet containing
bFGF with or without MAb3D5AB1. The average pH was 7.38 F
0.14, with four of the five corneal pHs decreasing slightly. Despite
this decrease in corneal pH after treatment with bFGF and
MAb3D5AB1, the pH remained above the range required for
MAb3D5AB1 to be active. Given that MAb3D5AB1 and angiostatin
inhibited bFGF-induced neovascularization in the CAM assay, we
also measured the pH of fertilized egg yolks and albumin. We found
that the pH of the egg yolk is 5.89 F 0.15. The pH of albumin is
considerably higher (9.05 F 0.06); however, the albumin is
withdrawn from the eggs 5 days before treatment of the CAM.
We hypothesized that the low pH present in the fertilized chicken
CAM compared with the rat cornea accounts for the difference in
the results of these two assays. Moreover, these in vivo studies are
in accord with our in vitro data described above.

HUVEC. A, inhibition of purified F1 ATP synthase by MAb3D5AB1. Purified F1
ATP synthase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at k of 340 nm
by coupling the production of ADP to the oxidation of NADH via the pyruvate
kinase and lactate dehydrogenase reaction, in which a decrease in the
absorbance at k of 340 nm indicates ATP hydrolysis and thus active protein.
MAb3D5AB1 inhibited purified F1 ATP synthase in a dose-dependent manner
at 0 Ag/mL (a), 5 Ag/mL (b), 10 Ag/mL (c ), 20 Ag/mL (d ), and 40 Ag/mL (e ).
Sodium azide (NaN3, 2%), a known F1 ATP synthase inhibitor, was used as a
positive control to show 100% inhibition (f ). Representative data (n = 3). B,
inhibition of cell surface ATP generation by MAb3D5AB1 at low pHe. Extracellular
ATP generation on HUVEC was measured by bioluminescent surface assay
following 20-s incubation with medium in the presence or absence of ADP.
MAb3D5AB1 inhibits piceatannol-sensitive ATP synthesis on the cell surface of
HUVEC at low pHe (6.7) compared with neutral pHe (7.2). Piceatannol is a
stilbene phytochemical that inhibits F1F0 ATP synthase. Points, the percentage
decrease in piceatannol-sensitive ATP synthesis in cells treated with
MAb3D5Ab1 was calculated by dividing the average luminescent intensity for
cells at a given pH treated with a single concentration of MAb3D5AB1 by the
average luminescent intensity for untreated cells at the same pH (n = 4); bars,

30 min following an acute intracellular acidification of pHe from 7.4 to 6.7. First, at
pHe 7.4, five initial steady-state readings of pHi established that the cells were at
steady state. Next, acute extracellular acidification was introduced by
replacement of the original 1 mL medium with 1 mL low pHe 6.7 medium
containing 0 (x) or 10 Ag/mL MAb3D5AB1 (X). MAb3D5AB1 treatment caused
intracellular acidification compared with pHe 6.7 medium alone. Three pHi
readings per coverslip plate were taken every 5 min for a 30-min time course
beginning at the time of extracellular acidification and averaged. Each
experiment was repeated two or three times. Points, average pHi for the two
treatment groups; bars, SD.

ing domains 2 and 3, but not the individual domains, may localize
the epitope to a junctional sequence spanning the domains.
Because domains 2 and 3 are crucially involved in the enzymatic
activity of F1 ATP synthase–domain 2 contains the active
nucleotide binding pocket, and the motion of enzyme catalysis is
transduced through domains 2 and 3 (32–35)–it is not surprising
that an antibody binding this region should exhibit inhibitory
effects on F1 ATP synthase activity.
Indeed, in an in vitro assay measuring F1 hydrolytic activity,
the only anti-F1 monoclonal showing enzymatic inhibition was
MAb3D5AB1, which recognizes the highly conserved and catalytic
h-subunit. Furthermore, MAb3D5AB1 inhibition of F1 was dose
dependent and, at a concentration of 40 Ag/mL (f0.27 Amol/L),
achieved similar inhibition of ATP synthase activity as angiostatin at a much higher concentration of 10 Amol/L (6). The
clinical importance of the h-subunit of ATP synthase in cancer
remains to be elucidated, but studies have shown downregulation of the h-subunit in several human cancers (34).
Apparently, down-regulation of the angiostatin receptor protects
these cancerous cells from the effects of locally circulating
angiostatin.
Proton translocation across F0 is coupled to the rotation of F1.
Thus, we expected that as MAb3D5AB1 inhibited both bidirectional ATP synthase enzymatic actions of ATP synthesis and
hydrolysis, proton translocation across the endothelial cell
membrane by F1F0 ATP synthase might also be impaired by
MAb3D5AB1. Angiostatin and polyclonal antibodies against ATP

compared with pHe 7.4. Compared with a control of no antibody, six mAbs to

recognized the catalytic h-subunit of F1 ATP synthase and
inhibited F1 ATP synthase activity. The remaining mAbs recognized
the noncatalytic a-subunit of F1. ELISA binding assays established
that the anti-h-subunit mAb, MAb3D5AB1, bound to bovine and
E. coli F1, and to the latter with a K d(app) of 16 nmol/L. Comparatively, angiostatin binding to E. coli F1 ATP synthase showed a
K d(app) of 405 nmol/L, establishing a higher binding affinity of
MAb3D5AB1 for F1 ATP synthase.
To determine the region of the epitope recognized by
MAb3D5AB1, we generated recombinant domains of the human
F1 h-subunit. MAb3D5AB1 binds preferentially to the construct
spanning domains 2 and 3, although not to separate constructs of
domain 2 or 3. MAb3D5AB1 recognition of the protein encompass-

synthase inhibit F1 ATP synthase activity and affect proton
translocation across the cell membrane, causing intracellular
acidosis (8, 12, 15). Here, we showed that MAb3D5AB1 markedly
inhibited cell surface ATP generation only at low pHe, suggesting
that MAb3D5AB1 would have a greater effect on HUVEC pHi
regulation by cell surface ATP synthase at low pHe. Indeed, we
observed that MAb3D5AB1 treatment depressed pHi of endothelial cells under conditions of external acidosis. The observed
intracellular acidification was achieved by a molar concentration
of antibody over 10-fold less than of angiostatin, as determined in
a previous study (18). These results strongly suggest that, as with
angiostatin, MAb3D5AB1, which binds specifically to ATP
synthase, inhibits the enzymatic and proton-pumping actions of
ATP synthase, resulting in compromised enzymatic activity and
pHi. Acidosis is a characteristic common to the tumor microenvironment, resulting from inefficient tumor vasculature and tumor
reliance on glycolytic metabolism with attendant generation of
lactic acid. The apparent efficacy of MAb3D5AB1 under conditions
of low pHe may be due to increased activity of cell surface ATP
synthase (12) and, hence, greater effect of inhibition of the ATP
synthase.
With evidence that MAb3D5AB1 binds to, and inhibits ATP
synthase to a greater extent than angiostatin, we next studied the
effect of MAb3D5AB1 on endothelial cell tube formation.
MAb3D5AB1 significantly impedes endothelial cell tube formation
under conditions of acidosis. Tube formation is a measure of the
angiogenic capability of endothelial cells (35). To validate these
in vitro data, we tested the antiangiogenic potential of MAb3D5AB1
in two in vivo models with significantly different pHs—the low pH
CAM assay and the higher pH rat corneal neovascularization assay.
The reduced pH in the CAM is likely due to the function of the
allantois, which is a waste reservoir for the developing chicken
embryo, collecting such products as uric acid (36). MAb3D5AB1
showed significant antiangiogenic activity in the acidic environ-

ment of the CAM, validating this angiogenesis model for use in
testing compounds targeting the angiostatin receptor. Although
the antibody did not inhibit angiogenesis in the rat corneal
neovascularization assay, this was expected given the normal tissue
pH of the cornea and our in vitro results indicating efficacy only at
low pHe. Importantly, our data from this model indicate that
MAb3D5AB1 would most likely not inhibit nonpathologic angiogenesis, such as in wound healing, occurring at the normal
physiologic pH.
Since Folkman proposed in 1971 that targeting tumor
vasculature might effectively halt tumor growth, the field of
antiangiogenesis has progressed to include several potential
antiangiogenic therapies for cancer. In preliminary phase II
trials, recombinant human angiostatin combined with standard
chemotherapy showed a partial response in 39% and achieved
stable disease in 39% of 23 patients with non–small cell lung
cancer (3).
MAb3D5AB1 can be studied for further antiangiogenic
characteristics in vitro and in vivo and could be used to prevent
tumor angiogenesis. Advantages of mAb therapy include high
specificity, binding affinity, and limited side effect profiles. In
addition, antibodies have a longer half-life in serum relative to
angiostatin, and our data show that MAb3D5AB1 has similar
effects to angiostatin in vitro and in vivo at considerably lower
molar doses.
