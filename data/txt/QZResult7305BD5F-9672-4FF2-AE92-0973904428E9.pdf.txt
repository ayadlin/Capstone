BACKGROUND. The initial management of patients with clinical stage IS (cIS)
nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) has evolved from primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) to induction chemotherapy. The objectives of the current study were to determine the clinical outcome, patterns of
relapse, and incidence of teratoma in the retroperitoneum for men with cIS
NSGCT.

METHODS. Between 1988 and 2004, 24 patients with cIS stage NSGCT were evaluated and treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Clinical and patho-

patients underwent primary RPLND, and 17 patients received induction chemotherapy as initial management. Clinical outcomes, patterns of relapse, and patho-

cell tumor (GCT) present. Four of those patients did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, and all experienced systemic relapse. Of the 17 patients who received
induction chemotherapy, 3 patients underwent elective postchemotherapy
RPLND (PC-RPLND), and 14 patients were followed expectantly. Four patients
who were followed expectantly relapsed in the retroperitoneum and underwent
PC-RPLND. Of the 7 patients who underwent PC-RPLND, 1 patient had fibrosis
(14%), but 6 patients (86%) had teratoma, including 1 patient who also had a
viable GCT in the retroperitoneum. Overall, the incidence of teratoma or viable
GCT in the retroperitoneum after chemotherapy was 43% (6 of 14 patients). At a
median follow-up of 35 months, 23 men remained alive, and 1 man had died of
disease.

CONCLUSIONS. The current data suggest that patients with cIS stage NSGCT will

he incorporation of serum tumor markers (STMs) into the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system is unique to the
staging of testis cancer. Clinical stage IS (cIS) nonseminomatous
germ cell tumor (NSGCT) is defined by the presence of persistently
elevated STMs after orchiectomy without detectable radiographic
evidence of metastatic disease. The initial management of patients
with cIS NSGCT has evolved from primary retroperitoneal lymph
node dissection (RPLND) to induction chemotherapy followed by
surveillance.1–3 This policy change was based on the high rate of
systemic relapse in men after primary RPLND, demonstrating the

high likelihood of occult, systemic, micrometastatic
disease. The 2 previous studies addressing the outcome after management of cIS NSGCT demonstrated
a 37% and 100% relapse rate after primary RPLND.1,3
Currently, the initial management of patients with
cIS NSGCT is International Germ Cell Consensus
Classification Group (IGCCCG) risk-appropriate
induction chemotherapy followed by surveillance if
STMs normalize after chemotherapy and the retroperitoneum remains normal.4
Emerging data suggest that complete control of
the retroperitoneum is critical for the successful
management of metastatic NSGCT. The uncontrolled
retroperitoneum predisposes patients to both early
as well as late relapses.5 After induction chemotherapy for clinical stage II (cII) and clinical stage III
(cIII) NSGCT, between 10% and 40% of patients have
viable germ cell tumor (GCT) or teratoma in the retroperitoneum at postchemotherapy RPLND (PCRPLND), respectively.6–9 Furthermore, approximately
20% of men who undergo PC-RPLND who have a
normal postchemotherapy retroperitoneum on computed tomography (CT) imaging (10 mm) will harbor retroperitoneal, viable GCT or teratoma.7,10,11 The
likelihood of teratoma in the retroperitoneum
depends on the presence or absence of teratoma in
the primary tumor and the degree of shrinkage of
the retroperitoneal adenopathy.12,13 Teratoma is dangerous, because it is chemorefractory and has the
potential for continued growth, malignant transformation, and predisposition for late relapse. Consequently, control of the retroperitoneum is critical.
To our knowledge, no previous study has
assessed the outcome of patients with cIS disease
who were treated initially with induction chemotherapy. The objective of our study was to determine the
patterns of relapse, clinical outcome, and incidence
of teratoma in the retroperitoneum for men with cIS
NSGCT.

tein (AFP) level was >15 ng/mL, or if the serum bhuman chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) level was
>2.2 U/mL without appropriate decline after orchiectomy, and if neither physical examination nor radiographic
imaging
revealed any
detectable
metastatic disease. A radiographic ‘‘normal retroperitoneum’’ was defined as no detectable retroperitoneal lymph nodes that measured >1 cm on CT
imaging. Clinical and pathologic data were obtained
from our prospective testicular cancer database. We
reviewed the pathologic findings from the orchiectomy specimens and from those patients who underwent RPLND. We report on the patterns of relapse
and clinical outcome. All patients who underwent
chemotherapy were classified as good risk by the
IGCCCG classification.14 Of the 24 patients identified,
7 underwent primary RPLND, all of which were performed before 1994, and 17 patients were managed
initially with induction chemotherapy. Although primary RPLND is not the current standard of care for
the management of cIS NSGCT, we elected to include
patients undergoing primary RPLND in this study to
demonstrate the incidence and histology of retroperitoneal disease in our cohort. Routine follow-up
included clinic visits approximately monthly in Year
1, every second month in Year 2, every third month
in Year 3, every fourth month in Year 4, every 6
months in Year 5, and annually thereafter. At each
visit, a history, physical examination, chest x-ray, and
STM evaluations were performed. A baseline abdominal CT scan after RPLND was obtained 6 months after RPLND and annually thereafter if teratoma was
present. Patients who underwent induction chemotherapy were followed by serial CT scans.
A Fisher exact test analysis was performed to
determine the association of teratoma in the orchiectomy specimen with the finding of teratoma in
the retroperitoneum. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 11.0; Chicago,
Ill), and P values <.05 were considered statistically
significant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
After Institutional Review Board approval, we identified 30 patients with cIS NSGCT of the testis who
were evaluated at our institution between 1988 and
2004. Of these patients, 24 had complete initial staging information reviewed at our institution confirming the diagnosis of cIS NSGCT and constituted our
study cohort. The remaining 6 patients with cIS
NSGCT were excluded from the study, because initial
clinical and radiologic information was not available
for review, and these patients initially were diagnosed
and managed at outside institutions. Patients were
clinically staged as cIS either if the serum a-fetopro-

these patients was 119 months (interquartile range
[IQ], 33–145 months). Of the 7 patients who underwent primary RPLND, 1 patient had a negative histology, and the remaining 6 patients had viable GCT
in the retroperitoneum, including 2 patients with teratomatous elements present in the resected specimen (Table 2). The 3 patients who received adjuvant
chemotherapy with 2 cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) remained free of disease (NED), whereas all
4 patients who were followed expectantly relapsed
systemically, including 1 patient who ultimately died
of progressive disease. For 3 of the 4 patients who
did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, STMs did
not normalize after primary RPLND.
Seventeen patients received induction chemotherapy as initial management (Fig. 2). The b-HCG
was elevated in 12 patients, the AFP was elevated in
11 patients before chemotherapy, and both AFP and
b-HCG were elevated in 6 patients (Table 1). The
median AFP was 27.6 ng/mL (IQ, 5.5–58.6 ng/mL),
and the median b-HCG was 24.6 ng/mL (0.75–55 ng/
mL). The median follow-up in these patients was 24
months (IQ, 12–52 months). All patients were classified as good risk according to IGCCCG risk criteria.
Fifteen patients received 4 cycles of EP as induction
chemotherapy, whereas 2 patients received either 3
or 4 cycles of bleomycin plus EP. All patients had
normal STM levels after chemotherapy.

Three patients who had normal CT scans after
chemotherapy underwent elective PC-RPLND at their
surgeon’s discretion, and all remain NED. The histologic findings in the retroperitoneum were teratoma
in 2 patients and fibrosis in 1 patient (Table 2). Fourteen patients were followed expectantly after induction chemotherapy, and all of these patients had no
evidence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy on radiographic imaging. Ten of these patients remained
NED; however, 4 relapsed during follow-up. All
patients who relapsed while on surveillance presented with retroperitoneal masses then underwent
PC-RPLND, including 1 patient who also had elevated STM who received salvage chemotherapy
before PC-RPLND. The retroperitoneum contained
teratoma in 3 patients and both teratoma and viable
GCT in the patient who was treated with salvage
chemotherapy (Table 2). In all, 7 patients underwent
PC-RPLND. The retroperitoneal pathology contained
teratoma with or without viable GCT in 6 patients
(86%) and fibrosis in 1 patient (14%).
In the cohort of 14 patients who underwent
RPLND in the primary (n 5 7) or postchemotherapy
setting (n 5 7), 8 patients (57%) had teratomatous
elements present in the retroperitoneum. Association
between the presence of teratoma in the orchiectomy
specimen and teratoma in the retroperitoneum was
observed; however, this association was not statistically significant (Table 3) (P 5 .16).
The median follow-up for all survivors was 35
months (IQ, 13–91 months) and there was 1 death
from disease. Overall, there were 8 relapses, including 4 that occurred in men who initially were treated
with primary RPLND, none of whom received adjuvant chemotherapy. The other 4 relapses occurred in
men who initially were treated with induction chemotherapy, none of whom underwent elective PCRPLND. The 1 patient who died of disease was managed initially with a primary RPLND using a modified right template and had histology that revealed
viable GCT and teratoma. This patient subsequently
relapsed in the retroperitoneum and was managed
with salvage chemotherapy followed by exploratory
laparotomy, which revealed teratoma with malignant
transformation to unresectable embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.

DISCUSSION
This study is the first large series to report on the
clinical outcome and patterns of relapse for men
with cIS NSGCT who were managed initially with
induction chemotherapy. After induction chemotherapy and surveillance for cIS NSGCT, 4 of 14 patients
relapsed, all of whom had disease in the retroperito-

neum. The 3 patients who proceeded directly to elective RPLND after chemotherapy remained NED.
These data suggest that PC-RPLND may be an important component in the management of patients
with cIS NSGCT after induction chemotherapy.
Davis et al. reported the Memorial Sloan-Kettering experience with treating cIS NSGCT in 11
patients who underwent primary RPLND with persistently elevated STMs.1 Viable GCT was present in 9

of 11 patients (82%) who underwent primary RPLND
with embroyonal sarcoma (EC) present in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes of all 9 patients. Of the 4
patients who initially received induction chemotherapy followed by surveillance, 3 remained NED. One
patient with negative markers had teratoma resected
at PC-RPLND 6 months after induction chemotherapy.1 All 11 patients, however, subsequently relapsed
systemically during follow-up. Because of the high

804

CANCER

relapse rates after primary RPLND observed by Davis
et al., clinical practice was changed to administer
induction chemotherapy. Taken together, the studies
by Davis et al. and Saxman et al. suggest that persistently elevated STMs after radical orchiectomy indicate not only the presence of retroperitoneal disease
but also a high risk of occult, systemic disease.1,3
Thus, the current initial management of patients
with cIS NSGCT should be induction chemotherapy.
The importance of initial treatment with induction
chemotherapy should be emphasized, because these
patients have occult, micrometastatic, systemic disease for which surgery alone is insufficient therapy.
However, the management of the retroperitoneum in
men with a radiographically normal retroperitoneum
after chemotherapy remains controversial.
Of the 7 patients who underwent PC-RPLND, 6
patients (86%) had teratoma present in the retroperitoneum, including all 4 patients who underwent PCRPLND at relapse. These data suggest that unresected teratoma is a contributing cause of relapse.
Resection of retroperitoneal teratoma is an important
component that must be considered in the comprehensive treatment of NSGCT. It is chemoresistant
and has an unpredictable biologic potential that
includes growth with obstruction, invasion or unresectability, a risk of malignant transformation, and
late relapse.15–18 Several investigators have demonstrated that, for men with cII and cIII NSGCT and a
normal postchemotherapy retroperitoneum on CT
imaging, approximately 20% to 30% will harbor teratoma in the retroperitoneum.7,10,11 In our current series, at least 8 of 24 patients (33%) had teratoma in
the retroperitoneum despite having an initially normal retroperitoneum. These data suggest that, with
continued long-term follow-up, initially undetectable
microscopic retroperitoneal teratoma will become
clinically manifest in many patients, highlighting the
importance of timely surgical resection for men who
have a normal postchemotherapy retroperitoneum.
The death in our series is a patient who demonstrated the potential consequences of more limited
resection templates and the devastating biologic
potential of unresected retroperitoneal teratoma. We
recently demonstrated that up to 25% of patients
with pathologic stage II disease will have viable GCT
or teratoma outside the boundaries of a modified
template, highlighting the importance of a complete
bilateral RPLND.19
In conclusion, the management of cIS NSGCT has
evolved from primary RPLND to induction chemotherapy. After induction chemotherapy, patients on surveillance remain at risk for relapse in the retroperitoneum,
including potential late relapses. We observed that 86%

of patients who underwent PC-RPLND had teratoma
in the retroperitoneum, which could have become a
potential site of relapse. We therefore recommend a
multidisciplinary approach to treating cIS NSGCT that
includes induction chemotherapy followed by PCRPLND to manage the retroperitoneum in a disease
that is perceived as only a variation of stage I disease.
cIS disease represents systemic disease and should be
treated accordingly.
