BACKGROUND: Azacitidine induces responses and prolongs overall survival compared with conventional care regimens
in patients who have high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, limited data are available concerning the efficacy and safety of azacitidine in patients who have lower risk MDS. METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated
74 patients with International Prognostic Scoring System low-risk or intermediate 1-risk MDS, who received azacitidine
on a national named patient program. At baseline, 84% of patients were transfusion-dependent, 57% had received erythropoietin, and 51% were aged >70 years. Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously for 5 days (n ¼ 29 patients), 7
days (n ¼ 43 patients), or 10 days (n ¼ 2 patients) every month at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily (n ¼ 45 patients) or at a
fixed dose of 100 mg daily (n ¼ 29 patients) and for a median of 7 cycles (range, 1-30 cycles). RESULTS: According to
the 2006 International Working Group criteria, overall response rate (ORR) was 45.9%, including complete responses
(10.8%), partial responses (9.5%), hematologic improvements (20.3%), and bone marrow complete responses (5.4%).
The ORR was 51.6% in 64 patients who completed 4 cycles of treatment. The median duration of response was 6
months (range, 1-30 months). After a median follow-up of 15 months, 71% of patients remained alive. A survival benefit was observed in responders versus nonresponders (94% vs 54% of patients projected to be alive at 2.5 years,
respectively; P < .0014). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were myelosuppression (21.6%) and infection
(6.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that azacitidine may be a feasible and effective treatment for

transform to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1,2 Because
of the heterogeneous nature of these neoplastic disorders,
several different systems have been proposed to identify
MDS subtypes. The most widely used are the FrenchAmerican-British (FAB)3 classification and the World
Health Organization (WHO)4,5 classification, both of
which are based mainly on morphologic criteria assessing
dysplastic features, blast cells, and ring sideroblasts, and
both also have contributed to recognizing some specific
clinical entities.
Although the FAB classification and the WHO classification may provide relevant prognostic information,
the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) is the
most commonly applied tool used to predict the longterm outcome of patients who are diagnosed with MDS.1
By using the IPSS classification, patients are categorized as
low risk, intermediate risk (Int-1 or Int-2), or high risk
based on cytogenetic subgroups, the percentage of bone
marrow blasts, and the number of cytopenias. For patients
with MDS, the IPSS provides an estimated evaluation of
life expectancy and transformation to AML that can vary
from a few months to several years, according to the level
of risk.1
Among the current therapeutic options available for
patients with lower risk MDS, it has been established that
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs),6-12 immunomodulatory drugs like thalidomide and lenalidomide,13-19
and immunosuppressive therapies20,21 can at least partially restore hematopoiesis and induce transfusion independence in selected patients. However, with the possible
exception of younger patients who are candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation,21-23 transfusions and
chelating therapy remain widely used treatment options
for a large number patients.9,23-25
Recently, the use of hypomethylating agents, such as
azacitidine or decitabine, has emerged as a possible new
treatment option for patients with MDS.26 These drugs
induce the re-expression of previously silenced genes that
are relevant for cell growth, differentiation, and apoptotic
processes, thus providing a rationale for an epigenetic
therapy in MDS.27-30
Azacitidine (Vidaza; Celgene, Summit, NJ) is a
DNA-hypomethylating agent with antineoplastic activity26 that is licensed in the United States for the treatment
of all MDS subtypes as defined by FAB criteria, in Europe
for Int-2–risk and high-risk MDS defined by the IPSS
classification, and in Europe for AML defined by the
WHO classification. In patients with higher risk MDS,
azacitidine reduces transfusion dependence, delays trans-

1486

formation to AML, and improves quality of life.31-35
Recent data also have demonstrated that azacitidine is the
first agent to induce a significant survival advantage compared with conventional care regimens in patients with
higher risk MDS.36 Most previous studies of azacitidine
in patients with MDS, however, included only a very
small proportion of those with lower risk disease, and a
specific analysis of response rates and survival based on
IPSS criteria was never performed exclusively on this population of patients. To evaluate the real-world clinical
benefits of azacitidine in patients with lower risk MDS,
we conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who
received this drug in an Italian named patient program.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
For the purposes of this retrospective analysis, patients
with IPSS low-risk or Int-1–risk MDS who received azacitidine through a compassionate-use, named patient program were identified in an institutional database from 22
medical centers in Italy between June 2005 and September 2007. Initially, 66 patients with MDS were classified
as IPSS low-risk (n ¼ 13 patients; 19.7%) or Int-1–risk (n
¼ 53 patients; 80.3%) on initial assessment. An additional 8 patients who were missing karyotype data also
were included because they had IPSS scores of 0 with
regard to cytopenias and bone marrow blast counts; therefore, even a hypothetical high-risk karyotype score would
not modify their risk class as greater than Int-1. Therefore,
in total, 74 patients were evaluated for efficacy and safety.
Assessment of IPSS scores and reviews of bone marrow cytology initially were completed by local investigators and
subsequently were centrally reviewed (by P.M., L.M., and
V.S). There was no change in IPSS grading after the central review, and only 2 patients (2.7%; 1 with unclassifiable MDS and 1 with refractory anemia) were reclassified
(both as refractory anemia with multilineage dysplasia).
All patients (or the relatives of patients who died)
provided written informed consent to allow the collection
of personal data in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and Italian privacy laws. To facilitate the systematic collection of patient data, a standard prepared form
was used. No specific blood or bone marrow samples were
obtained, and no specific instrumental or laboratory
examinations were undertaken in addition to the normal
investigations and follow-up controls that the different
centers regularly applied in these patients.

Procedures and Treatment
An azacitidine dose and administration schedule was
determined at the discretion of the prescribing clinician.
All transfusion-dependent patients received supportive
therapy with packed erythrocyte or platelet transfusions
and iron chelation according to a single-center policy.
Transfusion dependence was defined as the need for at
least 1 packed erythrocyte or platelet transfusion every 2
months. In all study centers, a hemoglobin level of <8 g/
dL and the occurrence of bleeding and/or a platelet count
<10,000/lL represented indications for transfusion.
Assessment of Efficacy and Safety
The primary efficacy endpoint of this retrospective analysis was overall response rate (ORR), which was assessed
according to modified International Working Group criteria37 and was defined as the combined rates of complete
response (CR), partial response (PR), hematologic
improvement (HI), and bone marrow CR. Patients were
considered to be responders if they had a response duration 8 weeks. The evaluation of response, as provided
initially by local investigators, was reassessed independently by a restricted panel of reviewers (P.M., L.M., and
V.S.) and was confirmed in 72 of 74 patients (97.3%)
before final analysis of the data.
Secondary outcomes were response duration, transfusion independence, AML transformation, overall survival (OS), and safety. Adverse events were graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0; National Cancer Institute,
Bethesda, Md) and were assessed at each patient visit.
Statistical Analysis
The correlations between different groups and treatment
response were estimated by using 2-sided chi-square tests
and Wilcoxon tests for categorical and continuous covariates, respectively. OS was calculated from the date therapy
started to the date of either death from any cause or last
follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS. ORR and OS were also assessed according to
age (aged <70 years vs 70 years), transfusion dependence at baseline (no vs yes), azacitidine dose schedule (75
mg/m2 daily vs 100 mg as a daily fixed dose), total median
azacitidine dose per cycle (700 mg vs >700 mg), and
prior therapy (no vs yes). Patients also were analyzed
according to IPSS subgroups (low risk or Int-1 risk) and
according to the more recent WHO-based prognostic
scoring system (WPSS)38 and The University of Texas M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) model,39 which

is specific to lower risk MDS. Both the WPSS and the
MDACC models include parameters that are not present
in the IPSS, such as transfusion requirement and WHO
classification38 or age and degree of thrombocytopenia,39
respectively.
For comparison of survival between 2 groups, the
log-rank test was applied. A P value .05 was considered
significant in all analyses.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
The main patient characteristics are presented in Table 1.
The median patient age was 70 years, and most patients
were men (52.7%) and were transfusion-dependent
(83.8%).
The majority of patients (73%) had previously
received at least 1 line of therapy before initiating azacitidine, including ESA in 58.1% of patients and low-dose
cytosine arabinoside or AML-like chemotherapy (followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in 1
patient) in 8.1% of patients.
Treatment Administration
Azacitidine was administered as inpatient treatment subcutaneously either at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily (60.8%) or
at a fixed dose of 100 mg daily (39.2%) (Table 1). The
most common treatment regimens that were used for azacitidine administration were a monthly schedule of 7 consecutive days or a 5 þ 2 þ 2 day schedule (azacitidine
given Monday through Friday, with no weekend dosing,
and Monday and Tuesday on treatment; received by
58.1% of patients) and a monthly schedule of 5 consecutive days (received by 39.2% of patients). A few patients
(2.7%) received azacitidine for 10 consecutive days or 5 þ
2 þ 5 days (weekend off treatment) of each month (Table
1). Patients received a median of 7 treatment cycles
(range, 1-30 cycles) (Fig. 1), and the median total dose
per cycle was 700 mg (range, 425-1105 mg per cycle).
Most patients received azacitidine as single-agent therapy
(74.3%), and the remaining patients received concomitant therapy with ESA (13.5%), ESA plus granulocyte–
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (2.7%), valproic acid
with or without all-trans retinoic acid (4.1%), or other
drugs (5.4%) (Table 1).
Efficacy Outcomes
Overall, 34 of 74 patients achieved a response (ORR,
45.9%), which included 8 CRs (10.8%), 7 PRs (9.5%),

15 HIs (20.3%), and 4 bone marrow CRs (5.4%) (Table
2). Among the 64 patients who received at least 4 cycles of
azacitidine therapy, the ORR was 51.6% (Table 2).
In total, 77% of responses occurred within the first
6 cycles, and most patients (59%) achieved their best
response between the fourth and sixth cycles of azacitidine
treatment. The remaining responses (23%) were observed
after the sixth cycle of treatment. Of the 25 patients who
had stable disease (SD), 8 patients continued to receive
azacitidine for 7 to 10 cycles without significant modifications in their disease condition.
Response to azacitidine was defined further according to patient subgroups (Table 3). There were no significant differences in ORR when patients were analyzed
according to age, transfusion dependence, azacitidine
dose, total median azacitidine dose per cycle, or prior therapy (Table 3). The median time from diagnosis was

similar between responders (21 months; range, 1-132
months) and nonresponders (22 months; range, 1-120
months). Five of 12 patients (41.6%) who received azacitidine in combination with recombinant erythropoietin
(with G-CSF in 2 patients) experienced a response that
was not observed previously with these drugs without
azacitidine.
Overall, the response rate did not differ significantly
among the different prognostic subgroups (Table 4). A
response was observed in 2 of 3 patients who had chromosome 7 abnormalities and in 3 of 6 patients who had
abnormal karyotypes, including del(5q).
Among the 34 patients who responded to azacitidine, the median duration of response was 6 months
(range, 1-30 months). Thirteen patients (38.2%) developed recurrent disease, including 3 of 8 patients who had
a CR, 2 of 7 patients who had a PR, 7 of 15 patients who
had an HI, and 1 of 4 patients who had a bone marrow
CR. Three patients who were still on therapy developed
recurrent disease after 4 to 12 cycles of treatment, and 10
patients developed recurrent disease out of therapy (after
6-9 cycles had been received). In 2 of the latter patients (1

dysplasia plus del 20 who had achieved a CR combined
with a cytogenetic response and 1 patient with a 5q syndrome who had a previous HI), a durable second response
was achieved when azacitidine was restarted.
At a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 4-30
months), the projected OS rate at 30 months was 70.8%
(Fig. 2, Top), and it was projected that more responders
compared with nonresponders would remain alive
(93.9% vs 53.8%, respectively; P < .0014) (Fig. 2, Bottom). A trend toward improved OS was observed favoring
patients who were not transfusion-dependent at baseline
(Table 3). OS was not influenced by age, azacitidine dose,
total median azacitidine dose per cycle, or prior therapy.
Likewise, no clear difference in OS was observed according to the different types of responses achieved (data not
shown).
Overall, the 1-year OS rate was 74.9%. OS
remained significantly lower in the higher risk categories
of WPSS and MDACC prognostic scores (Table 4). During the evaluated period (June 2005 to December 2008),
4 patients (5.4%) developed AML: None of those patients
had exhibited any response to azacitidine therapy after 1

1490

cycle, 4 cycles, 5 cycles, and 14 cycles, respectively. Thus,
as of December 15, 2008, 32 treated patients (43.2%) still
were receiving azacitidine treatment (including 24 responders and 8 patients with SD), 19 patients (25.7%)
were receiving alternative therapies, 21 patients (28.4%)
had died, and 2 patients (2.7%) were lost to follow-up.

were myelosuppression (21.6%), including thrombocytopenia plus neutropenia (n ¼ 6 patients), neutropenia
alone (n ¼ 4 patients), anemia plus neutropenia (n ¼ 2
patients), thrombocytopenia alone (n ¼ 3 patients), and
pancytopenia (n ¼ 1 patient). Infections were observed in
6.8% of patients (Table 5). Two patients required azacitidine dose reductions because of grade 3 thrombocytopenia plus neutropenia, and 3 patients discontinued
treatment after 1 to 5 cycles because of grade 4 adverse
events (atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia plus neutropenia, and pancytopenia, respectively; severe infection
[pneumonia] also occurred in the latter 2 patients). No
deaths attributable to azacitidine therapy were reported.

DISCUSSION
In this multicenter retrospective analysis, 74 patients with
IPSS-defined low-risk or Int-1–risk MDS received azacitidine for a median of 7 cycles. Over half of the patients
who received at least 4 cycles of therapy achieved a
response, and the median response duration was 6
months. It is noteworthy that approximately 50% of the

study population was aged 70 years, and 57% had recurrent or resistant disease after previous ESA treatment and
had few alternative treatment options.
In total, 77% of responses occurred within the first
6 cycles of azacitidine treatment. However, a minority of
patients with MDS responded after >6 cycles of therapy.
Furthermore, 10 of 13 observed recurrences developed after interruption of the treatment; in 2 of these patients, a
second response was achieved when azacitidine was given
again. These data are consistent with the benefit of continued azacitidine treatment observed in patients with higher
risk MDS.40 Altogether, these observations highlight the
possible benefit of maintaining patients with MDS on
azacitidine therapy in the absence of undue toxicity or
signs of progressive disease.
In the current study, responses included improvement in hemoglobin levels and in neutrophil and platelet
counts, as reported previously in patients with higher risk
MDS, although to a lesser extent. Furthermore, responses
were observed in patients with chromosome 7 abnormalities, consistent with recently reported results.41,42 The
response to azacitidine was not influenced by age, prior
therapy, transfusion dependence at baseline, azacitidine
dose, or the total median azacitidine dose per cycle. The
ORR also was similar among the different prognostic subgroups when patients were reclassified according to the
WPSS and the MDACC lower risk-oriented prognostic
models. In addition, transfusion independence was
obtained in the majority of responders.
With a median time since diagnosis at baseline of
21.5 months, 71% of patients remained alive after a median follow-up duration of 15 months (range, 4-30
months) after the initiation of azacitidine treatment. The
projected OS was not influenced by patient age, prior
therapy, or azacitidine dose. However, a favorable trend

1491

was observed in patients who were transfusion independent at baseline.
In our cohort of patients with lower risk MDS, similar to what was observed in Cancer and Leukemia Group
B (CALGB) Trial 9221,34,35 which used FAB classification, the survival of patients in higher risk categories, as
defined by the MDACC score, and, perhaps more noteworthy, the survival of patients in the ‘‘very-high-risk’’ category (according to the dynamic WPSS score, which
permits evaluation and allows reassessment of prognosis
for patients with MDS during the course of the disease)
remained poorer than the survival reported in the other
MDS subsets despite treatment with azacitidine. Indeed,
because this was a nonrandomized, retrospective study
without a control arm, we hesitate to draw conclusions
about the impact of azacitidine on the OS of any single
subgroup.
To date, few data are available on the specific use of
azacitidine in patients with lower risk MDS. In the
randomized azacitidine versus supportive care CALGB
Trial 9221, only 44 patients with low-risk MDS were
included.34 The ORR in patients who received azacitidine
(n ¼ 23) was 59% (9% CRs, 18% PRs, and 32% HIs), as
assessed using the CALGB response criteria, and OS was
longer in azacitidine-treated patients than in controls (44
months vs 27 months, respectively). No specific information on the outcomes of 11 patients who had refractory
anemia or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts from
another CALGB study (the 8921 protocol) were given.32
A reanalysis of these trials did not produce further detailed
data on patients with lower risk MDS.35
More recently, in a US community-based, multicenter patient registry study (AVIDA; currently only published in abstract form), 52 MDS patients with IPSS
classified as low risk or Int-1 risk received a median of 3
cycles of azacitidine.43 In total, 24 patients (46%)
achieved erythrocyte transfusion independence.43 In addition, 8 of 13 patients (62%) who received platelet transfusions at baseline achieved platelet transfusion
independence.43 Most of these responses were obtained
during the first 2 cycles.43 The most common adverse
events were anemia (20%), thrombocytopenia (13%),
nausea (11%), constipation (10%), fatigue (10%), and
neutropenia (10%).43
Finally, using International Working Group 2000
criteria, Lyons and coworkers44 reported an HI in 44% to
56% of 151 patients with MDS (63% had lower risk
MDS according to FAB criteria) who received 3 alternative dosing schedules of azacitidine. The proportion of

1492

transfusion-dependent patients with lower FAB risk who
achieved transfusion independence ranged from 50% to
61% in the 3 arms of the study.44 However, patients with
MDS were not classified according to the IPSS because of
the lack of cytogenetic data.44 Furthermore, no data on
survival were reported by those authors.44
Our findings demonstrated that azacitidine generally is tolerated well in a population of patients with lower
risk MDS, including elderly patients (median age, 70
years). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse event, as
expected, was myelosuppression, but only a few patients
required azacitidine dose reduction or interruption, and
none of the patients died from infections or hemorrhagic
complications.
The use of azacitidine recently was associated with
improved survival in patients with high-risk MDS.36 It is
noteworthy that, in the current study of patients with
lower risk MDS, a significant OS benefit was observed in
responders to azacitidine compared with nonresponders.
An improvement in survival was reported recently in
patients with MDS who received ESA with or without GCSF compared with untreated patients.11,12 Taken together, these observations suggest that different effective
treatments possibly may modify the natural history of
lower risk MDS (and, consequently, the paradigm of the
desired therapeutic objectives in these patients), not necessarily by inducing a CR but simply by improving cytopenias and eliminating their negative impact on survival (ie,
by reducing heart failure-related deaths from anemia,
reducing the negative effects of iron overload because of
transfusions, or decreasing the rate of infections or hemorrhages in patients with severe neutropenia or thrombocytopenia). Other mechanisms also might play a role, for
example, the potential activity of azacitidine in delaying
progression to AML, as demonstrated in high-risk
MDS34-36; however, the limited number of patients who
experienced leukemic evolution in the current study did
not allow us to draw any conclusions regarding this issue.
In conclusion, in this retrospective study, we have
demonstrated that azacitidine may be a good therapeutic
option for patients with lower risk MDS. Adverse events
were minor, and clinicians generally continued administering treatment for several cycles without interrupting
therapy before benefit or clear inefficacy was evident.
These observations represent real-world data, because
patients were treated outside of the setting of a clinical
trial, in which strict inclusion and exclusion criteria may
have limited the generalizability of the findings. Although
we are conscious that our analysis may suffer from relevant

Cancer

bias derived from the multicenter and retrospective nature
of the study, we believe it clearly indicates that azacitidine
should be considered within the therapeutic armamentarium of IPSS-classified low-risk or Int-1–risk MDS,
including elderly and transfusion-dependent patients who
are refractory to or unsuited for treatment with growth
factors and for whom limited treatment options remain.
Prospective studies are warranted to confirm the
impact of azacitidine on survival in patients with lower
risk MDS who have anemia or other symptomatic cytopenias. The effect of different dosing schedules, doses, duration of therapy, route of administration,44-46 and
combinations of azacitidine with other agents47 also
should be investigated further in this important subset of
patients with MDS.
