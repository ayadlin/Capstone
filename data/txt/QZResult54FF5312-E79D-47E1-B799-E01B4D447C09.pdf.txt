BACKGROUND. Dacarbazine (DTIC) and pegylated interferon (IFN)–a-2a have
both demonstrated some efficacy as single agents in metastatic melanoma. To
the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to test a combination of
these 2 agents in a phase 2 trial.

METHODS. Twenty–eight patients with stage IV melanoma without brain metastases were treated with DTIC (at a dose of 850 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) combined
with weekly pegylated IFN–a-2a at a dose of 180 lg. The study was initiated to
evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the combination. The primary study endpoint was objective response.
RESULTS. Twenty–five patients were evaluable for response. Two patients (8.0%)
achieved a complete response that continued for >480 days and 746 days,

not received treatment or had not developed disease progression during adjuvant
IFN treatment for stage II/III disease. The median duration of response was 236
days, the median progression-free survival was 56 days, and the overall survival
time was 403 days. Few grade 3 toxicities and only 1 grade 4 toxicity were
observed (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria).

CONCLUSIONS. The combination of DTIC and pegylated IFN–a-2a was found to be
well tolerated in patients with metastatic melanoma. The response rate of 24%,
including 2 long-lasting complete responses, is encouraging, but must be con-

time. After 30 years of clinical trials, dacarbazine
(DTIC) is still considered as a reference drug. Prospectively randomized trials examining DTIC as a
single agent have demonstrated response rates ranging from 6% to 12% in recent years, without a clear
impact on overall survival noted.3,4 Therefore, surgical resection of metastases and multidisciplinary
approaches, including radiotherapy for palliative
care, are still the treatment options of first choice.
Immunotherapeutic approaches using recombinant
cytokines such as interferons (IFNs) or interleukin-2
have not demonstrated a clear benefit compared
with DTIC alone. A biochemotherapy regimen containing IFN–a, interleukin-2, and 3 different cytotoxic
drugs (the cisplatin, vinblastine, dacarbazine [CVD]
regimen) has also failed to increase survival rates.2.
Therefore, it is widely accepted that the therapy of
choice in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma is a treatment within a clinical trial, to gain
knowledge regarding new therapeutic options with
more efficacy in this disease.
Recombinant IFNs have been shown to demonstrate limited antitumor activity in patients with metastatic melanoma when used as single agents.
Furthermore, IFNs are widely used for the adjuvant
treatment of patients with malignant melanoma with
benefits noted with regard to recurrence-free survival
and a small impact on overall survival.5–7
The combination of DTIC and recombinant IFN–
a has been studied intensively during the last 15
years. Despite numerous clinical trials and a metaanalysis of this combination regimen, it appears that
this combination affects only the response rate but
not the overall survival time.8 Therefore, there is a
clear medical need for more effective drug combinations. One potential disadvantage of recombinant
IFNs are the postinjectional peaks in the serum concentration that are associated with flu-like symptoms
occurring some hours after drug exposure. The relatively short half-life of recombinant IFN–a required a
new drug formulation that would be more acceptable
for long-term treatment and constant drug levels.9
Recombinant human pegylated IFN–a-2a (PEGIFN–a-2a) (Pegasys; Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley,
NJ) is a form of IFN–a-2a that has been modified by
the covalent attachment of a branched 40-kilodalton
methory-polyethyleneglycol-moiety. Already licensed
for use in patients with chronic hepatitis C, studies
in this patient population found that PEG-IFN–a-2a
has superior efficacy compared with nonpegylated
IFN–a. The long half-life of PEG-IFN–a-2a allows for
a more convenient once-weekly dosing regimen with
improved tolerability. The formation of binding or
neutralizing antibodies against PEG-IFN–a-2a is rare

1405

and occurs in only 2% to 6% of patients.10,11 Apart
from phase 1/2 clinical trials conducted in patients
with renal cell cancer (RCC) and hematologic malignancies, to our knowledge there is only 1 clinical trial
regarding the use of PEG-IFN–a-2a in patients with
melanoma published to date.12
In the current study, we report on the results of
what to our knowledge is the first prospective, openlabel phase 2 trial combining DTIC with PEG-IFN–a-2a.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients who were eligible for this clinical trial provided written informed consent and fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: age 18 years and 75
years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2, confirmed metastatic melanoma (stage IV according to the AJCC
staging system),1 at least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST), minimum indicator lesion
size of >10 mm, and a wash-out period of 4 weeks
for previous IFN treatment. Patients with adjuvant
previous IFN treatment were accepted, but not those
with previous pegylated IFN treatment or those with
tumor progression to stage IV disease during IFN
therapy. Patients with mucosal, ocular, or melanoma
of unknown origin were excluded. Pregnant or lactating women were not treated. Patients could not have
evidence of brain metastases noted during the baseline examination. Patients with a history of malignancies other than basal cell carcinoma or squamous
cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix
were excluded. Patients with a history of severe cardiac disease (New York Heart Association [NYHA]
classification of III/IV), myocardial infarction within
the last 6 months, ventricular tachyarrhythmia
requiring ongoing treatment, or unstable angina
were not included in the study. Further exclusion criteria included a medical history of severe psychiatric
diseases, especially depression; seizure disorders
requiring anticonvulsant treatment; a history of
poorly controlled thyroid dysfunctions; known infections with hepatitis B or C or the human immunodeficiency virus; patients with immune diseases except
for rheumatoid arthritis; and patients with abnormal
baseline hematologic laboratory parameters (hemoglobin <10g/dL, white blood cell count <4/nL, platelet count <100/nL, bilirubin >1.5 the upper limit of
normal [ULN], alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and
aspartate aminotransferase >2.5 ULN, alkaline phosphatase >2.5 ULN, or serum creatinine >1.5 ULN).
Patients had to have a life expectancy of at least
3 months.

Protocol Design and Treatment
This 3-center, open-label phase 2 study of DTIC plus
PEG-IFN–a-2a was approved by the ethics committee
of each participating center and their respective
authorities.
DTIC was given intravenously at a dose of 850
mg/m2 every 3 weeks for a maximum of 25 weeks.
PEG-IFN–a-2a was given at a dose of 180 lg once
weekly subcutaneously for up to 25 weeks. If subjects
did not present with progressive disease at the end
of the 25–week period, they were allowed to continue
treatment until disease progression as part of an independent Expended Assess Program (EAP) for an
undefined period of time. In the absence of toxicities
greater than grade 1 (using National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria [NCI-CTC] [version 2.0]),
DTIC therapy was repeated every 3 weeks. For
patients unable to tolerate 180 lg of PEG-IFN–a-2a,
the dose was reduced to 90 lg and was maintained
at this level, if tolerated by the patient, until disease
progression.
Any patient who experienced grade 2 laboratory
abnormalities or adverse events remained on the
assigned dose if possible. For those subjects experiencing a grade 2 elevation in ALT, PEG-IFN–a-2a was
temporarily withdrawn. Patients experiencing grade 2
flu-like symptoms continued to receive PEG-IFN–a2a and DTIC. PEG-IFN–a-2a and/or DTIC was temporarily withdrawn and/or reduced if a patient
experienced grade 3 laboratory abnormalities
(except for elevated ALT); grade 4 fever, chills, or
other flu-like symptoms; grade 3 adverse events
(except for flu-like symptoms); or grade 2 elevated
ALT.
This phase 2 study was initiated to evaluate the
tolerability, safety, and efficacy of the combined
treatment regimen. The primary endpoint of the current study was the evaluation of the response rate.
Response and Toxicity Assessment
All patients underwent in–depth follow-up evaluations during the study. Tumor response was assessed
using the RECIST criteria.13 Patients with objective
responses (CRs and partial responses [PRs]) were reevaluated by an independent radiology department
(Dr. Delorme, Radiology Department, DKFZ Heidelberg, Germany). At the time of study initiation; in
Weeks 9, 17, and 25; and at the follow-up visits thereafter, the following imaging evaluations were used:
brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT scan of the chest and abdomen, lymph node ultrasound, and bone scintigraphy.
Other investigations were used if clinically indicated.
Patients were asked questions concerning their medi-

cal history and underwent a complete physical examination including vital signs and electrocardiogram (if
mandatory). Performance status was assessed according to the ECOG scale. Laboratory tests included hematology, blood chemistry, urine analyses, and
thyroid tests, as well as a pregnancy test in premenopausal and perimenopausal women. Blood was
obtained during the weekly visits for the first 4 weeks
and then every 3 weeks until the end of treatment, as
well as once each in Week 9 and Week 17. Visits every
3 months were performed thereafter during the follow-up period. The visits in Weeks 2 and 3 were performed outside of the study centers (eg, by the
treating general practitioner). All other clinical visits
were required to be conducted in the respective study
center.

Statistical Analyses
Because of the single-arm design of the current
study, a conservative approach for the primary analysis of safety and efficacy was used. The definition of
the analysis population and the replacement of missing values were considered. The selection of the sample size was based on practical considerations and
not on power calculations. The study was designed
to prove the feasibility of the combination of PEGIFN–a-2a with DTIC. Instead of P values of a predefined hypothesis, 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)
(2-sided) were calculated for the main safety and efficacy parameters. An intention–to–treat (ITT) assessment of tolerability, safety, and efficacy was defined
for all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the
combination of DTIC and PEG-IFN–a-2a. The perprotocol analysis included all subjects who met the
criteria for the ITT safety population and had no
major protocol violations that could in any way
influence the assessment of efficacy. Major protocol
violations included inadequate information regarding
tumor response; inadequate patient compliance,
defined as missing 2 consecutive doses or missing
>20% of the projected injections at the time of study
withdrawal; and, lastly, a treatment duration of <25
weeks, with the exception of progressive tumor
response being the reason for withdrawal.
The survival rates, including time to disease progression and time to death, were analyzed by a
Kaplan-Meier analysis in the ITT efficacy populations
only. This type of analysis considers subjects lost to
follow-up as censored observations. In addition,
more conservative survival rates were calculated for
the 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month follow-up visits, assuming subjects lost to follow-up as
having died at the date of the last contact.

In the analysis of the safety data, the incidence
of adverse events was calculated at the preferred
term level and the organ system level according to
the classification of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The same analysis was
performed for the drug-related adverse events.
Furthermore, adverse events were presented in individual subject listings, which included intensity and
correlation to the study drugs and were appropriate
to the NCI-CTC grades.
All patients’ case report forms were monitored
on-site at the participating centers by independent
monitors.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between August 2004 and September 2006, a total of
28 patients were included in the current study. Eight-

een of 28 patients (64.3%) were classified as having
AJCC stage IV M1c disease; the remaining 10 study
patients were classified as having M1b disease
(35.7%). Approximately 39.3% of patients had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level before the initiation of treatment. There were 16 men and 12
women, with a median age of 56 years. Approximately 50% of the patients were IFN-naive, which
means they did not receive IFN as an adjuvant treatment for stage II/III disease. The clinical characteristics of the entire study population are summarized in
Table 1.

Treatment Administration
A median of 3 cycles of DTIC and 9 cycles of subcutaneous PEG-IFN–a-2a were administered over 9
weeks. The mean duration of treatment was 103.5
days (median, 62 days). The reasons for treatment
discontinuation were progressive disease in all but 1

patient. Only 1 patient (ID 03-02 in Table 1) had a
discontinuation that was related to an adverse event.
The 43-year–old woman demonstrated a CR of her
lung metastases after 9 weeks (3 cycles) of treatment.
Because of unacceptable dizziness (NCI–CTC grade
2), she refused further treatment. However, at the
end of the study observation period, the patient was
still in a complete disease remission without having
received any further treatment.

Response Evaluation and Survival
Of the 28 patients enrolled into the current study, 25
were evaluable for efficacy parameters. Three
patients were not evaluable because of withdrawal of
consent and their refusal of any re-evaluations and
follow-up investigations. Two patients (8.0%) demonstrated CRs that lasted for >480 days and 637 days,
respectively. The CRs were reconfirmed by an independent radiologic review committee. Neither
patients received adjuvant IFN treatment before progressing to stage IV disease.
Four patients (16.0%) demonstrated PRs lasting
up to 384 days (median of 236 days). The lung was
the predominantly affected organ in these patients,
but 2 of the 4 patients with a PR were observed to
have disease in the adrenal glands, peritoneum, and
skin as well. Two of the 4 patients received adjuvant
IFN treatment, but only 1 developed disease progression during treatment to stage IV melanoma.
In 1 patient, stable disease lasting for 56 days
was observed. This patient was IFN–naive before the
initiation of the study. The median time to first
response was 67.5 days, and the duration of response

was 236 days. The median progression-free survival
was calculated as 56 days. The median overall survival time was 403 days. Details regarding the outcome parameters are shown in Table 2. The KaplanMeier plots for progression–free survival and overall
survival are shown in Figures 1 and 2.

Safety Evaluation
All 28 patients included into the current study were
evaluable for safety parameters. Table 3 summarizes
all treatment-related adverse events with the greatest
severity. There was only 1 case of grade 4 leukopenia,
which spontaneously resolved after the interruption
of IFN treatment. All grade 3 events recovered after

whereas 3 patients (12%) required dose reductions
for DTIC. Life-threatening adverse event were not
observed.

DISCUSSION
Pegylation of therapeutic proteins is a well–established method for delaying clearance and reducing
protein immunogenicity (unpublished data). Pegy-

lated proteins have been demonstrated to be safe
and effective in humans.9 Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data obtained from animals and a
phase 1 study in healthy volunteers indicated that
PEG-IFN–a-2a injected once a week has the potential
for superior efficacy in patients with hepatitis compared with conventional IFN injected 3 times weekly
(unpublished data). Studies of PEG-IFN–a-2a in
patients with RCC and chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) yielded an overall response rate of 13.4% and
a median overall survival of 16 months for mono-

therapy (in RCC patients)14 and a major cytogenetic
response in 35% of patients for PEG-IFN–a-2a compared with 18% for standard IFN treatment (in CML
patients).15. The side effects of PEG-IFN–a-2a were
comparable to those noted with conventional IFN–a2a, with a trend in favor of the pegylated IFN.15
In what to our knowledge is the only study of its
use in metastatic melanoma, 3 different dose cohorts
of PEG-IFN–a-2a were compared in 150 patients. An
open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial evaluated the
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of subcutaneous PEGIFN–a-2a in patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma. PEG-IFN–a-2a was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 180 lg, 360 lg, or 450 lg for a
maximum of 24 weeks. Response rates of between
6% and 12% and an overall survival of between 217.5
days and 322 days were obtained for the 3 dosing
groups. PEG-IFN–a-2a at a dose of 180 lg was tolerated by the majority of patients, but treatment withdrawals were more pronounced in the 360–lg and
450–lg dose groups (19% and 16%, respectively) in
contrast to the group receiving the dose of 180 lg of
PEG-IFN–a-2a (6%).12
Although there was a trend toward a higher
response rate and longer survival for the high-dose
groups (360 lg and 450 lg of PEG-IFN–a-2a) compared with the group receiving 180 lg once weekly, it
was questionable whether this was linked to the dose
levels or to different patient characteristics in the 3
groups.12 Because the dose-response relation was
unclear, and serious adverse events leading to the
withdrawal of patients were observed more often in
the higher dose levels, a dose of PEG-IFN–a-2a of
180 lg once weekly was chosen for the current clinical trial combined with the chemotherapeutic agent
DTIC. It was hypothesized that the improved pharmacokinetic profile of PEG-IFN–a-2a in combination
with DTIC may increase the tumor response rates
and possibly the survival rate without increasing
toxicity.
To our knowledge, the current study is the first
trial combining PEG-IFN–a-2a with standard-dose
DTIC in patients with metastatic melanoma. The
response rate of 24% is interesting to note because
the majority of patients (64.3%) were diagnosed with
M1c disease and, furthermore, approximately half of
the patients were already pretreated with conventional IFN–a in the adjuvant setting. All responses (2
CRs and 4 PRs) were confirmed by an independent
reviewer.
Of the 6 patients with clinical responses and the
1 patient with a stable disease as the best response,
only 2 patients were not IFN-naive and only 1
patient demonstrated disease progression during ad-

juvant IFN treatment. Six of 7 patients who developed disease tumor progression during adjuvant
conventional IFN treatment also developed progressive disease during PEG-IFN–a-2a therapy. However,
it is still speculative to argue that the probability of a
clinical benefit from PEG-IFN–a-2a is higher in IFNnaive patients. The interpretation of our trial results
is limited because of the relatively low number of
patients included into this phase 2 trial. It is interesting to note that the results of the current trial confirm that durable CRs can be found in studies
combining conventional chemotherapeutic agents
with pegylated IFN–a. A meta-analysis of >3000
patients from multiple randomized trials by Huncharek et al concluded that the combination of DTIC
with conventional IFN–a is capable of producing
response rates greater than those observed with
DTIC monotherapy alone.8 However, the impact on
the overall survival time is still unclear and needs to
be clearly demonstrated in a phase 3 trial design.
Temozolomide has also been combined with
conventional IFN–a. A prospective, randomized,
phase 3 trial from Germany and Switzerland compared the combination of temozolomide with IFN–a
with temozolomide alone. Kaufmann et al demonstrated a 13.4% rate of PRs or CRs in the monotherapy arm compared with 24.1% for the treatment arm
with temozolomide and conventional IFN–a. There
was only a slight trend toward an improvement in
overall survival (8.4 months for single-agent treatment vs 9.7 months for the combination).16
Because our phase 2 trial was not comparing different regimens, it is difficult to draw final conclusions. However, it is obvious that the safety profile of
the combination of PEG-IFN–a-2a and DTIC is convenient, with few grade 3 and 4 toxicities. In addition, the number of treatment discontinuations
because of treatment-related adverse events was
comparably low. In the single-agent trial of PEGIFN–a-2a performed by Dummer et al, dose reductions or dose delays because of adverse events or
laboratory abnormalities occurred in 23% of the
patients treated with the 180–lg dose; approximately
6% of the patients required treatment withdrawal in
this group.12
In conclusion, it appears that the combination of
PEG-IFN–a-2a with DTIC does not significantly add
to the toxicity of PEG-IFN–a-2a alone and is well-tolerated in general. However, the combination of DTIC
with PEG-IFN–a-2a appears to enhance the singleagent activity of PEG-IFN–a-2a significantly. It cannot be ignored that patient selection played a role in
the promising response rate noted in this relatively
small phase 2 trial performed in only 3 melanoma

Pegylated IFN–a-2a and DTIC in Melanoma/Hauschild

centers. However, approximately 64.3% of the
patients in the current study were diagnosed with
M1c disease and none of the patients were classified
as having M1a disease. It is interesting to note that
in this clinical trial, 6 of 7 patients with clinical
responses or disease stabilization after treatment
were either IFN-naive or failed to progress to stage
IV disease during adjuvant treatment with IFN. This
observation indicates the need for further investigations of predictive criteria for a treatment response
to IFN. The findings of this pilot trial could eventually lead to the careful consideration of pretreatment modalities in forthcoming, IFN-based, first-line
trials for patients with stage IV melanoma.
