Abstract
Anti-VEGF therapies beneﬁt several cancer types, but drug
resistance that limits therapeutic response can emerge. We generated cell lines from anti-VEGF–resistant tumor xenografts to
investigate the mechanisms by which resistance develops. Of all
tumor cells tested, only A431 (A431-V) epidermoid carcinoma
cells developed partial resistance to the VEGF inhibitor aﬂibercept. Compared with the parental tumors, A431-V tumors secreted greater amounts of IL6 and exhibited higher levels of phosphoSTAT3. Notably, combined blockade of IL6 receptor (IL6R) and
VEGF resulted in enhanced activity against A431-V tumors. Sim-

ilarly, inhibition of IL6R enhanced the antitumor effects of
aﬂibercept in DU145 prostate tumor cells that displays high
endogenous IL6R activity. In addition, post hoc stratiﬁcation of
data obtained from a clinical trial investigating aﬂibercept efﬁcacy
in ovarian cancer showed poorer survival in patients with high
levels of circulating IL6. These results suggest that the activation of
the IL6/STAT3 pathway in tumor cells may provide a survival
advantage during anti-VEGF treatment, suggesting its utility as a
source of response biomarkers and as a therapeutic target to
heighten efﬁcacious results. Cancer Res; 76(8); 2327–39. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

the environment of reduced tumor vessels (12–14). These resistance mechanisms cause insensitivity of tumor vasculature to antiVEGF treatments and/or decreased dependence of tumors on
angiogenesis. Combination treatments targeting VEGF and other
angiogenic pathways such as angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) or Delta-like
4 (Dll4) are being evaluated to increase the efﬁcacy of angiogenic
blockade. However, the underlying mechanisms of tumor cells
becoming less dependent on angiogenesis in response to antiVEGF therapies also need to be investigated.
To begin addressing this, we aimed to identify molecules
involved in mediating anti-VEGF resistance using xenograft tumor
models with acquired resistance to VEGF blockade. Aﬂibercept is a
recombinant fusion protein that potently binds all isoforms of
human and murine VEGF-A, VEGF-B and placental growth factor
(PlGF; ref. 4). A431 human epidermoid cell tumor xenografts are
sensitive to aﬂibercept, but can acquire resistance when treated for
longer time periods (several weeks or more). We established a
stable variant cell line (A431-V), which is partially resistant to
aﬂibercept and allowed the direct comparison of resistant tumors
to their sensitive parental A431 (A431-P) counterparts. Studies
using these two cell lines revealed that A431-V tumors have
increased levels of proinﬂammatory mediators including IL6, as
well as activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. The activation
of the IL6/STAT3 pathway led us to investigate the effects of an
anti-IL6R antibody (sarilumab), which blocks IL6 receptor signaling on human cells. Importantly, sarilumab does not bind or
block murine IL6R. Treatment of A431-V tumor cells with sarilumab reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3, and enhanced the
antitumor activity of aﬂibercept against A431-V tumors in vivo.
Similarly, IL6R inhibition enhanced the antitumor activity of
aﬂibercept in another tumor model with high endogenous IL6R
activity, namely Du145 prostate tumors. In addition, IL6

VEGF plays a key role in physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis, including tumor angiogenesis. Blockade of the VEGF pathway is effective at inhibiting angiogenesis in many tumors (1–3).
Several VEGF pathway inhibitors, including the monoclonal antiVEGF antibody bevacizumab, the soluble receptor aﬂibercept
(VEGF Trap, known as ziv-aﬂibercept in the United States), and
the mAb to VEGF receptor 2 (ramucirumab) delay tumor growth
in preclinical tumor models (4–6) and extend the survival of
cancer patients (7–11).
Despite showing broad activity in both preclinical and clinical
settings, not all tumors respond to anti-VEGF therapies, and those
that do may eventually become resistant. Clinical and preclinical
studies suggest that resistance of tumors to anti-VEGF therapies
can occur via several mechanisms: (i) changes in the tumor
microenvironment resulting in upregulation of various proangiogenic factors, which lead to vessels that are less sensitive to VEGF
blockade and/or (ii) changes in the characteristics of cancer cells,
such as mutations and epigenetic changes, which provide the cells
with a survival advantage and/or increased invasive potential in

overexpression rendered sensitive A431 cells resistant to aﬂibercept. Finally, IL6R blockade decreased the number of A431
tumors that escaped long-term aﬂibercept treatment. To assess
potential clinical relevance, we determined whether circulating
levels of IL6 were associated with poorer outcome in a phase II
clinical trial of ovarian cancer patients treated with aﬂibercept. A
correlation between high levels of IL6 and poorer tumor response
to anti-VEGF therapy was observed. Taken together, these data
suggest that resistance to VEGF blockade can be mediated at least
in part by increased IL6/STAT3 signaling in tumor cells, and that
blockade of IL6 signaling on tumor cells can overcome this
resistance.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cells and reagents
Tumor cells including A431 human epidermoid cell skin carcinoma and Du145 human prostate carcinoma were obtained
from the ATCC and grown according to ATCC guidelines. All cell
lines were authenticated between 2012 and 2015 using the STR
Proﬁle Testing by ATCC. A431 parental (P) and variant (V) cells
were obtained by in vivo passaging, as described in Fig. 1.
Aﬂibercept (also known as VEGF Trap or ziv-aﬂibercept in the
United States) is a recombinant fusion protein that potently binds
all isoforms of human and murine VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF.
Sarilumab (REGN88) is a fully human IgG1 mAb that binds
human IL6R and prevents binding of IL6. Cetuximab is a chimeric
mouse-human (30:70) IgG1 mAb that competitively inhibits the
binding of EGF to its receptor EGFR.
Cell culture and in vitro cell growth
A431 and Du145 cells were cultured in 10% FBS, DMEM, and
MEM, respectively. Preparation of conditioned media (CM) was
done by the following method: A431-P and A431-V cells were
grown in serum-free media for 16 hours followed by media
collection. A431-P and A431-V cells grown on a 6-well plate at
a density of 1  106 cells/well or on 8-well chamber slides at a
density of 30,000 cells/well were serum starved for 16 hours
followed by exposure to CM for 1 hour. Cells were either lysed
to detect p-STAT3 status by Western blot analysis or ﬁxed for
immunocytochemistry. Cell lysate preparation for the RTK array:
A431-V and A431-P cells were lysed in modiﬁed RIPA buffer
(1% NP-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 50 mmol/L Tris.HCl pH 7.4,
150 mmol/L NaCl, EDTA 1mmol/L, Na3VO4 1 mmol/L, NaF
5 mmol/L, glycerophosphate 5 mmol/L and Roche complete
protease inhibitor cocktail tablets).
In vitro cell growth. A total of 1  105 A431-P or A431-V cells were
seeded and cell numbers were assessed after a 3-day growth
period. Doubling time (DT): DT (h) ¼ (t  t0)log2/(logN 
logN0), where t and t0 are the times at which the cells were
counted, and N and N0 are the cell numbers at times t and t0,
respectively.
RTK signaling antibody array
PathScan RTK Signaling Array Kit (Cell Signaling Technology)
was used following manufacturer's instructions.
Luminex analysis
For A431-P and A431-V CM analysis, Milliplex Human Cytokine/Chemokine 42 Plex Kit (Millipore) was used according to the

Flow cytometry
A431-P and -V cells were treated with Enzyme Free Cell
Dissociation Solution Hank's Based Solution (Millipore, catalog # S-004-C), blocked in 2% FBS/PBS and human truStain
FcX (BioLegend, catalog # 422302), incubated with anti-human
IL6Ra-APC (catalog # 352805, BioLegend) for 1 hour at room
temperature and assessed by ﬂow cytometry.
In vivo tumor studies
Tumor studies were performed in accordance with Regeneron's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.
A total of 1  106 A431-P or A431-V cells, or 5  106 Du145
cells were implanted subcutaneously into CB.17 SCID mice
(Taconic). Tumor volume was assessed with calipers using the
L  W2/2 formula. 100–200 mm3 tumor-bearing mice were
randomized into groups and treated subcutaneously with
25 mg/kg hFc (control protein), aﬂibercept (VEGF Trap), sarilumab, combination of aﬂibercept and sarilumab (25 mg/kg
each), or cetuximab 2 times per week. Tumor growth curves:
average mean  SD.
Generation of IL6-overexpressing A431 tumor cells
Lentiviral pLOC vector encoding human IL6 and TurboGFP
(nuc) reporter genes were purchased (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and
packaged as per manufacturer's instructions. A431 carcinoma
cells were virally transduced with pLOC-IL6 lentivirus particles
and isolated by two rounds of ﬂow cytometry cell sorting.
IHC and immunocytochemistry
Cryosections. Optimal cutting temperature–embedded tissue was
cut into 5-mm sections, air dried, and ﬁxed in acetone (20  C) for
10 minutes, and using Avidin-Biotin Blocking Kit (Vector Laboratories), blocked in 2.5 % normal goat serum/1 % BSA/PBS, Ki67 antibody (BD; clone B56), biotinylated antibody (Vector
Laboratories), and 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma). Tissue
sections were counterstained with methyl green.
In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Sigma) was used according to
the manufacturer's recommendations and apoptotic index was
determined using HALO software (Indica Labs).
FFPE tissue sections. Tumors were ﬁxed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin, dehydrated through graded ethanol and xylenes,
embedded in parafﬁn, cut into 8-mm sections, and deparafﬁnized.
For p-STAT3 IHC, antigen retrieval was done, blocking was
performed with 4% BSA, and incubation with p-STAT3 antibody

Results
Generation and characterization of an aﬂibercept-resistant
A431 tumor cell line
Human xenograft tumors grown in mice show different degrees
of response to VEGF blockade. To study resistance mechanisms,
we aimed to derive tumor cell lines with acquired resistance to

2330 Cancer Res; 76(8) April 15, 2016

aﬂibercept from aﬂibercept-sensitive tumors. For this aim, we
selected four aﬂibercept-sensitive tumor lines, namely A498,
Colo205, 786-0, and A431, and treated tumor-bearing mice with
high-dose aﬂibercept (25 mg/kg, twice weekly), for up to 7 weeks.
For three of the four tumor lines, we observed complete growth
stasis (Colo205, A498) or gradual incremental tumor growth
(786-0), but no outgrowth of resistant tumors based on our
criteria (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, A431 human epidermoid cell carcinoma tumors exposed to long-term high-dose
aﬂibercept showed complete and prolonged tumor growth inhibition for approximately 6 weeks followed by conspicuous outgrowth of some of the tumors (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1
for individual tumor growth).
One of the outgrowing A431 tumors was harvested, and fragments of viable tumor tissue were reimplanted subcutaneously
into other SCID mice (the procedure is outlined in Fig. 1A). In
some cases, reimplanted A431 tumors that were treated with
aﬂibercept continued to grow. This reimplantation and selection
procedure was repeated once more, and we again observed tumor
growth in the presence of aﬂibercept. In parallel, we performed a
similar reimplantation procedure with A431 tumors treated with
human control protein (Fc fragment only, Fig. 1A). After in vivo
passaging and selection, the aﬂibercept and control-treated
tumors were harvested, minced, and transferred to tissue culture
dishes for propagation in vitro. The cell lines derived from control
and aﬂibercept-treated tumors were called A431-P (parental) and
A431-V (variant), respectively (Fig. 1A).
To conﬁrm that the isolated A431-V cells retained resistance to
aﬂibercept, tumors from A431-V and A431-P cell lines were
studied for growth kinetics and response to aﬂibercept. We
observed that control treated A431-V tumors grew slightly faster
than control-treated A431-P tumors (Fig. 1C). In addition, A431V tumors continued to grow during treatment with aﬂibercept,
albeit at a slower rate (Fig. 1C), suggesting that A431-V tumors are
inherently resistant to VEGF blockade. These differences in tumor
growth were mirrored when assessing cell proliferation in tissue
sections by detecting the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Fig. 1D).
Control-treated A431-V tumors had higher numbers of proliferating cells in the tumor center than control treated A431-P tumors,
consistent with the faster growth rate of A431-V tumors (Fig. 1C
and D). Aﬂibercept treatment dramatically reduced the number of
proliferating cells in A431-P tumors (Fig. 1D), with changes being
apparent as early as 24 hours after aﬂibercept administration
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). In contrast, aﬂibercept treatment
had a much smaller effect on cell proliferation in A431-V tumors
(Fig. 1D). Similarly, TUNEL staining revealed that aﬂibercept
treatment increased apoptotic cells in A431-P tumors, but not
in A431-V tumors (Fig. 1E).
Interestingly, the growth rates of A431-P and A431-V cells in
vitro did not differ signiﬁcantly (Fig. 2A). In addition, A431-V
tumors had increased vessel density compared with A431-P
tumors, although vessel density after VEGF blockade was similar
in A431-P and A431-V tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C).
A431-P and A431-V tumor lysates did not show differences in
murine (20.5  2 and 20.8  5 pg/mg, respectively) or human
VEGF (13  1.9 and 12.1  4 ng/mg, respectively), suggesting that
VEGF levels were not responsible for the difference in vessel
density.
We next wanted to determine whether the resistance of A431-V
tumors was speciﬁc to anti-VEGF agents, or whether it was a more
generalized resistance to targeted therapy. A431 cells express high

levels of EGFR and are normally sensitive to EGFR antibodies.
Variants of A431 that are resistant to EGFR blockers have been
described previously (15). EGFR activation was not altered
in A431-V cells, as no difference was observed in a phosphoprotein array (Fig. 3A). To determine EGFR activity, we assessed
phospho-ERK1/2 levels by Western blot analysis and observed
that P-ERK1/2 in A431-V was somewhat lower compared with
A431-P (Fig. 2B), suggesting similar EGFR activity in both cell
lines. To determine whether A431-V tumors, which were selected
for resistance to aﬂibercept, maintained sensitivity to EGFR
blockade, mice bearing A431 variant or parental tumors were
treated with the EGFR antibody cetuximab. Both A431-V and -P
tumors were similarly responsive to cetuximab, whereas, as
expected the variant tumors were resistant to aﬂibercept (Fig.
2C and D). Together, these ﬁndings indicate that the aﬂibercept
resistance of A431-V tumors is a speciﬁc and stable trait, which
provides a model to study the underlying molecular mechanisms
of VEGF-resistant phenotype.
Identiﬁcation of pathways/factors mediating aﬂibercept
resistance in A431-V tumors
To explore the mechanisms of aﬂibercept resistance in A431-V
tumors, we ﬁrst utilized a phospho-protein array to compare the
activities of 28 receptor tyrosine kinases and 11 downstream
signaling molecules in A431-V and A431-P cell lines (Fig. 3A).
The most distinct difference between the resistant and sensitive

tumor cells was a marked increase in the phosphorylation of
STAT3 at Tyr705 (Fig. 3A). The increase in phospho-STAT3 was
conﬁrmed by Luminex as well as Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B
and C, respectively). STAT3 can be phosphorylated in response to
various secreted cytokines and chemokines, including IL6, IL10,
and LIF (16). To determine whether the phosphorylation of
STAT3 in A431-V cells is mediated by secreted factors, we exposed
A431-P cells to CM from A431-V cells. We observed that phosphoSTAT3 was increased, and was localized in the nucleus, in A431-P
cells treated with CM from A431-V cells (Fig. 3D, third lane and E).
In contrast, phospho-STAT3 in A431-V cells was notably reduced
after incubation with A431-P CM (Fig. 3D, fourth lane and E),
suggesting that secreted factor(s) mediate the phosphorylation of
STAT3 in A431-V cells.
To identify the factors secreted by A431-V cells that could
mediate STAT3 activation, we compared the relative expression
levels of secreted proteins in A431-P and A431-V cells using a
quantitative proteomics technique called SILAC (stable isotope
labeling with amino acids in cell culture; Supplementary
Fig. S3A and S3B). We observed increased expression of 80
proteins and decreased expression of 98 proteins in the secretome of A431-V cells compared with A431-P cells (Supplementary Table S1). As many secreted signaling proteins, such as
cytokines, are below the current detection limit of mass spectrometry, a multiplex Luminex assay was performed in parallel
to measure the concentrations of 42 cytokines in A431-P and

Of these cytokines, CXCL-1 and IL6 are known to activate

IL6/STAT3 Signaling Mediates Anti-VEGF Resistance

network as one of the most activated networks (in addition to IL8
and IL1a networks) in A431-V cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A and
S5B). In addition, increased protein expression of serum amyloid
A (SAA), S100 calcium-binding protein A7 (S100A7), ﬁbronectin
(FN1), and IL36g (IL36G) was observed (Fig. 3G), all of which
have been reported to be downstream of the IL6/STAT3 pathway
(21–24). Upregulation of SAA and NGAL mRNA was also
observed in A431-P cells exposed to A431-V CM (Supplementary
Fig. S3C). On the basis of these data, we hypothesized that
secreted IL6 might be mediating phosphorylation of STAT3 in
A431-V cells.

agent caused a signiﬁcant growth delay of Du145 tumors, suggesting a role for autocrine IL6 signaling in Du145 tumor growth.
Aﬂibercept as a single agent had a more dramatic effect than
single-agent sarilumab, causing some tumor regression (Fig. 5B).
However, the combination of aﬂibercept plus sarilumab caused a
more rapid and pronounced tumor regression than aﬂibercept
alone (Fig. 5B), further supporting the possibility that IL6 signaling limits the effectiveness of VEGF blockade in some tumors.
Consistent with active IL6/STAT3 signaling in Du145 tumors,
sarilumab decreased STAT3 phosphorylation as assessed by IHC
of tumor sections (Fig. 5C).

Blockade of IL6 signaling by anti-IL6R antibody partially
attenuates STAT3 activity in vitro and completely overcomes
aﬂibercept resistance in vivo
To assess whether elevated STAT3 activation in A431-V cells
was due to increased IL6 signaling, we determined whether A431V cells and tumors have higher IL6 levels than their A431-P
counterparts. Indeed, IL6 protein levels in both A431-V cell CM
and A431-V tumor lysates were more than 3-fold higher than
those in A431-P counterparts (Fig. 4A). In contrast to IL6, levels of
IL6R were similar on A431-P and -V tumor cells (Fig. 4B). To
determine whether increased phosphorylation of STAT3 in A431V tumors was due to the increased IL6, we used an IL6 receptor
antibody (sarilumab) that blocks IL6 binding to IL6R (25). As
shown in Fig. 4C, STAT3 phosphorylation in cultured A431-V cells
was noticeably reduced by blocking IL6R with sarilumab,
although not to quite the same level as seen in A431-P cells.
To test the role of elevated IL6/STAT3 signaling in aﬂibercept
resistance of A431-V tumors, we treated tumor-bearing mice with
sarilumab and/or aﬂibercept to assess the effects on A431-V and
A431-P tumor growth. Sarilumab binds and blocks human IL6R
but not murine IL6R, so its actions are speciﬁc to the A431 human
tumor cells. Sarilumab had no effect on parental A431-P tumor
growth and did not enhance the effects of aﬂibercept, indicating
that the growth of A431-P tumors is not dependent on
IL6 signaling, irrespective of whether VEGF activity is inhibited
(Fig. 4D, left). While single-agent sarilumab had no effect on the
growth of A431-V tumors, the combination of sarilumab plus
aﬂibercept had a signiﬁcantly greater effect than aﬂibercept alone,
completely inhibiting A431-V tumor growth (Fig. 4D, right). This
ﬁnding indicates that IL6 signaling limits the effectiveness of
aﬂibercept in A431-V tumors. The changes in growth kinetics of
A431-V tumors upon aﬂibercept, sarilumab, or aﬂibercept plus
sarilumab were reﬂected in differences in proliferation, as assessed
by Ki-67 IHC (Fig. 4E). Consistent with a more prominent role for
IL6/STAT3 signaling in A431-V tumors, Western blot analysis
revealed that A431-V tumors have elevated levels of phosphoSTAT3 compared to A431-P tumors, and that this STAT3 phosphorylation can be blocked by sarilumab treatment (Fig. 4F).
These ﬁndings conﬁrm that aﬂibercept resistance in A431-V cells is
attributable to the increased STAT3 phosphorylation and IL6
signaling.
To extend our ﬁndings on the role of IL6/STAT3 signaling in
limiting aﬂibercept efﬁcacy, we tested the effects of sarilumab as a
single agent and in combination with aﬂibercept on the growth of
Du145 prostate tumor xenografts. Cultured Du145 cells exhibit
constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation that can be inhibited by
blocking IL6R with sarilumab, indicating the presence of an
autocrine IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway (Fig. 5A) similar to that
in A431-V cells (Fig. 4C). As shown in Fig. 5B, sarilumab as a single

Overexpression of IL6 promotes aﬂibercept resistance, whereas
long-term blockade of both IL6 and VEGF decreases the
emergence of aﬂibercept resistance
To determine whether high IL6 expression is sufﬁcient to
induce resistance to aﬂibercept, A431 cells were transduced with
a lentiviral vector expressing human IL6 or an empty control
vector. Ectopic IL6 expression resulted in accelerated tumor
growth compared with control tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S6A). The high levels of ectopic IL6 expression also resulted
in increased circulating IL6 protein level (100–200 ng/mL; data
not shown), which was associated with body weight loss and early
morbidity of tumor-bearing mice (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
Aﬂibercept treatment starting when tumors were approximately
100 mm3 had no effect on tumor growth in IL6-overexpressing
A431 tumors, while being very effective in A431 empty vector
control tumors (Fig. 6A and B). These data indicate that elevated
IL6 expression in tumor cells is sufﬁcient to induce resistance to
aﬂibercept in A431 xenograft tumors.
To investigate whether blockade of the IL6 pathway could
prevent the emergence of aﬂibercept-resistant A431 tumors, we
treated A431 tumor bearing mice with control protein, aﬂibercept,
sarilumab, or a combination of aﬂibercept plus sarilumab when
the tumors reached a volume of approximately 100 mm3. Singleagent sarilumab treatment did not delay A431 tumor growth,
whereas both aﬂibercept single agent and aﬂibercept plus sarilumab combination treatments resulted in prolonged growth stasis
(Fig. 6C and D) for 6 weeks. As observed before, a subset of A431
tumors (5/7 tumors; Fig. 6D top, Supplementary Fig. S1) began to
grow signiﬁcantly after 6 weeks of continuous aﬂibercept treatment. In contrast, no tumors showed steady growth during the
latter phases of continuous treatment with aﬂibercept plus sarilumab (0/7 tumors; Fig. 6D, bottom). These results suggest that
changes in the IL6 pathway are not only relevant after aﬂibercept
resistance occurred, but also play a role in the development of
anti-VEGF resistance in A431 xenograft tumors.

IL6 serum levels may be predictive for outcome in ovarian
cancer patients treated with aﬂibercept
Taken together, our preclinical results show that activation of
the IL6/STAT3 pathway can provide evasive resistance to treatment with VEGF inhibitors such as aﬂibercept. To assess whether
this ﬁnding is clinically relevant, we examined the levels of IL6 in
ovarian cancer patients treated with single-agent aﬂibercept (26).
Serum levels of IL6 were measured in a group of patients in an
international, double blind, phase II study of advanced ovarian
cancer, in which two different doses of aﬂibercept were used as
monotherapy. Ninety-six patients were stratiﬁed into those with
high and low circulating IL6 (cutoff 3.86 pg/mL). Although the
study showed only a modest overall response rate to aﬂibercept,

we observed that patients with high IL6 serum levels (> median)
show signiﬁcantly poorer overall survival compared with those
with low IL6 levels (< median; Fig. 7). These results suggest a
correlation between high levels of IL6 and poorer tumor response
to anti-VEGF therapy.

Discussion
To uncover mechanisms underlying resistance to anti-VEGF
therapies, we used serial passaging and selection in vivo to
generate A431-V that is partially resistant to aﬂibercept, and
compared this line to the aﬂibercept-sensitive parental counterpart A431-P. Our studies found that increased levels of proinﬂammatory mediators, such as IL6, were associated with STAT3
pathway activation in A431-V tumors, and can contribute to
aﬂibercept resistance. Blockade of the IL6/STAT3 pathway with
an anti-IL6R antibody (sarilumab), which is speciﬁc to human
IL6R, rendered A431-V tumors more sensitive to aﬂibercept.
Similarly, IL6R inhibition enhanced the activity of aﬂibercept in
another tumor model with strong endogenous IL6/STAT3 activity, namely Du145 prostate tumors. In addition, IL6 overexpression rendered A431 tumors resistant to aﬂibercept, suggesting
that elevated IL6 expression is sufﬁcient to provide a survival
advantage to tumor cells during aﬂibercept treatment. In these
experiments, activation of IL6R/STAT3 signaling in cancer cells is
mediated by human IL6 because mouse IL6 does not activate the
human IL6R (27), and murine IL6R is not inhibited by sarilumab, a human-speciﬁc IL6R antibody. Limitations of working
with human tumor cells in immunocompromised mice include

www.aacrjournals.org

the lack of species cross-activity of some factors such as IL6, thus
potentially limiting tumor–stromal interactions that could
induce STAT3 signaling in other tumor compartments (43).
Nevertheless, based on these ﬁndings, we conclude that in
A431-V tumors, aﬂibercept resistance is mediated to a large
extent by increased IL6/STAT3 signaling in tumor cells, and that
blockade of IL6R can overcome resistance to aﬂibercept.
Various clinical studies have correlated high pretreatment
serum IL6 level with poor outcome in patients with different
types of cancer including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(28), stage II and III gastric carcinoma (29), prostate cancer (30),
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (31), metastatic breast cancer
(32), and ovarian cancer (33). Elevated levels of IL6 in cancer
patients could be due to increased expression in normal immune
cells as a consequence of chronic (systemic) inﬂammation, and/or
from stromal or cancer cells within tumors. The resulting activation of the STAT3 transcription factor in cancer cells is essential for
IL6-dependent oncogenic activities such as promoting cancer cell
proliferation and survival (34). STAT3 activation has been shown
to support cancer cell survival in the conditions of growth factor
deprivation (35) and to promote chemoresistance in cancer cells
exposed to hypoxia (36), suggesting that STAT3 may be a potentially important cancer cell survival factor in tumors treated with
antiangiogenic therapies. Our ﬁndings that patients with high IL6
serum levels showed poorer survival than those with low IL6
levels in a phase II study of advanced ovarian cancer where
aﬂibercept was used as monotherapy (26), suggests that our
preclinical ﬁndings could have clinical signiﬁcance and warrant
further investigation.

indicated by a black # symbol, showed intermittent growth throughout the experiment, but did not show escape as deﬁned above. One combination-treated
tumor grew at the end of the experiment, but only showed an increase in tumor volume of 33% between day 42 and 49, indicated by a blue star next to the
tumor growth curve

Resistance to anti-VEGF therapies can occur via several mechanisms: (i) upregulation of various proangiogenic factors resulting
in vessels that are less sensitive to VEGF blockade and/or (ii)
changes in the characteristics of cancer cells, which provide the
cells with a survival advantage and/or increased invasive potential
in the environment of reduced tumor vessels (12–14). Our
approach to induce variants of A431 tumor cells that are resistant
to aﬂibercept allowed direct comparisons between parental and
variant tumors. For example, screening of phospho-protein arrays
found that phospho-STAT3 was the major difference between
parental and variant A431 tumor cells. We also used unbiased
SILAC screens to test for overall differences in the secreted protein
proﬁle (secretome) of parental and variant cells. Detailed expression analysis revealed upregulation of various potentially proan-

2336 Cancer Res; 76(8) April 15, 2016

giogenic factors, including IL8 and CXCL1 in A431-V tumors,
which could contribute to the increased vessel density. A key role
for CXCL1 in mediating aﬂibercept resistance was ruled out in our
model system. Given the STAT3 activation we observed in A431-V
tumors, we decided to focus on IL6, rather than IL8 in subsequent
studies. A large body of literature suggests that IL6 activates STAT3
(37, 38) and, in addition, our studies implicate a key role for the
IL6/STAT3 pathway in resistance to anti-VEGF therapies.
Notably, our studies on the role of IL6 in resistance to antiVEGF therapies focus on autocrine IL6/STAT3 signaling in the
cancer cells. Autocrine IL6 signaling has been reported in various
cancer types, including multiple myeloma (39), prostate cancer
(40), lung cancer (41), and breast cancer (42). In our studies on

Aﬂibercept treatment is more effective in increasing overall survival in ovarian cancer patients with low IL6 levels. In an international, double blind, phase II
study of advanced ovarian cancer, aﬂibercept was used as a monotherapy. Patients received either a 2 or 4 mg/kg of aﬂibercept every 2 weeks and were monitored
for overall response. The study showed a modest response rate of 5% in both arms, and the ovarian indication has not been further vigorously pursued,
in part due to this data. When the data was stratiﬁed on the basis of low (< median) and high (> median) IL6 serum levels, it became apparent that patients
with high IL6 levels show a worse response compared with those with low IL6 levels.

signaling in cancer cells is solely mediated by IL6 derived from the
human cancer cells, but not the murine stromal cells, because
mouse IL6 does not activate the human IL6R (27). Although
human IL6 activates mouse IL-6R on stromal cells, this interaction
is not inhibited by sarilumab, which is a human-speciﬁc IL6R
antibody. Therefore, the effects of sarilumab reported here are due
to the interruption of autocrine IL6/STAT3 signaling in cancer
cells. Although other studies have reported that increased activation of tumor or stromal STAT3 can lead to enhanced STAT3
signaling in tumor endothelial cells (43), such a mechanism is
apparently not at play in the A431-V model. Instead, our data
highlight a mechanism of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, in
which the cancer cell characteristics change and provide a survival
advantage in the environment of reduced tumor vessels.
Although IL6 has previously been implicated as a potential
biomarker for targeted anti-VEGF therapy, the results have been
inconsistent. When treated with bevacizumab plus a chemotherapeutic regimen, a better outcome was reported for metastatic
colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with a signature that included
lower than average baseline IL6 serum levels (44), whereas in
another study of mCRC, a worse outcome was associated with a
signature that included lower than average IL6 serum levels (45).
High baseline IL6 levels were also reported to predict shorter
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in
patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinomas (46). In line
with these later studies, we observed in an ovarian cancer trial that
aﬂibercept-treated patients with high IL6 had poorer survival than
patients with low IL6 serum levels. However, caution should be
taken when using serum IL6 levels as a biomarker, as our studies
suggest that IL6R signaling on tumor cells is the relevant feature
that confers resistance to anti-VEGF therapy.
IL6 could be a potential biomarker for anti-VEGF therapies, but
our data now suggest that IL6 can also mediate anti-VEGF resis-

tance and thus might be a valid therapeutic target when combined
with anti-VEGF therapies in cancer patients. Although the data
presented in this article do not provide details on how IL6/STAT3
activation in the tumor cells can confer resistance to aﬂibercept
treatment, we hypothesize that a double hit of targeting the
vasculature, thus diminishing oxygen and nutrient supply for the
tumor cells, and blocking IL6, thereby shutting down the IL6/
STAT3–regulated survival and proliferation pathway in the tumor
cells and limiting IL6-mediated inﬂammation in the tumor
microenvironment, can overcome anti-VEGF resistance in tumors
with measurable IL6/STAT3 signaling. Further studies and clinical
trials are necessary to validate or refute the role of IL6 in anti-VEGF
resistance in different types of cancer.
