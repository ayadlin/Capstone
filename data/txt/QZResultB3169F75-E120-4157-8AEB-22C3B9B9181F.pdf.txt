SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

KDM2B (also known as FBXL10) controls stem cell self-renewal, somatic cell reprogramming
and senescence, and tumorigenesis. KDM2B contains multiple functional domains, including a
JmjC domain that catalyzes H3K36 demethylation and a CxxC zing finger that recognizes CpG
islands and recruits the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Here, we report that KDM2B, via
its F-box domain, functions as a subunit of the CUL1-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL1/SCFKDM2B)
complex. KDM2B targets c-Fos for polyubiquitylation and regulates c-Fos protein levels. Unlike
the phosphorylation of other SCF/CRL1 substrates that promotes substrates binding to F-box,
EGF-induced c-Fos S374 phosphorylation dissociates c-Fos from KDM2B and stabilizes c-Fos
protein. Non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic mutations at S374 result in c-Fos protein
which cannot be induced by EGF and accumulates constitutively and lead to decreased or
increased cell proliferation, respectively. Multiple tumor-derived KDM2B mutations impaired the
function of KDM2B to target c-Fos degradation and to suppress cell proliferation. These results
reveal a novel function of KDM2B in the negative regulation of cell proliferation by assembling an
E3 ligase to targeting c-Fos protein degradation that is antagonized by mitogenic stimulations.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcriptional factor complex is central to many biological
processes (2, 3). AP-1 complexes perform such diverse functions by potentially forming a
large number of homo- or hetero-dimeric complexes through combinatorial interaction
between members of Fos, Jun, ATF (activating transcription factor) and MAF
(musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma) protein families. Proto-oncogene c-Fos is one of the first
genes identified to be induced by mitogenic stimulation (4). c-Fos forms a dimeric complex
with c-Jun as the first identified AP-1 (1, 5-7). The regulation of c-Fos has been extensively
studied and serves as paradigm for the tight, dynamic and multiple level regulation of stress
and growth factor response (8). c-Fos is typically expressed at a very low level in both cells
cultured in vitro and in vivo. Mitogenic stimulation, particularly the extracellular signalregulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway, rapidly induces c-Fos mRNA (9, 10). The c-Fos
protein is intrinsically unstable due to degradation by the 26S proteasome and is protected
by phosphorylation (11, 12). Multiple putative phosphorylation sites, mostly in the Cterminal region of the c-Fos protein, have been reported to regulate c-Fos protein stability. In
particular, two residues—Ser362 and Ser374—were found to be phosphorylated by RSK1/2
and ERK1/2, respectively (13) and their phosphorylation stabilizes c-Fos protein (11).
Genetic studies using knock-in mutation demonstrated that phosphorylation on these two
residues plays important roles for cell differentiation, cytokine response and tumorigenesis
in vitro (14). In contrast, the identity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets c-Fos degradation
and is antagonized by ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation has not been established. UBR1, a
member of the N-end rule family E3 ligase, has been linked to c-Fos degradation in the
cytoplasm, which is protected by ERK5-mediated phosphorylation at two separate sites,
Thr232 which blocks c-Fos nuclear export and Ser32 which disrupts the interaction between
c-Fos and UBR1 (15). The physiological significance of ERK5-mediated protection of c-Fos
from UBR1-promoted degradation is currently unclear (16).

KDM2B (also known as FBXL10, NDY1, JHDM1B and CxxC2) controls stem cell selfrenewal (17), somatic cell reprogramming (18), cell senescence (19, 20), and tumorigenesis
(21-23). KDM2B/FBXL10 is a protein of multi-domains, including a JmjC domain situated
at the N-terminal region of the protein, followed by a CxxC domain, a PHD domain, a F-box
motif and seven leucine-rich repeats (LRRs, see Figure S2A). The JmjC domain catalyzes
H3K36 demethylation (24) and the CxxC zing finger domain recognizes CpG islands and
recruits polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to target genes (17, 25-28). KDM2B was
also found to interact with SKP1 via its F-box domain (27, 28), a linker protein involved in
the assembly of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, raising the
possibility that KDM2B could additionally contain an E3 ligase function. The substrate of
this putative KDM2B E3 ligase, however, has not been identified. Intriguingly, KDM2B has
been reported to repress the transcription mediated by either c-Jun or c-Fos through a

mechanism not completely understood (14, 28). In this study, we explore the possibility that
a KDM2B-containing E3 ligase targets c-Fos for ubiquitination and degradation.

RESULTS
KDM2B/FBXL10 and CUL1 destabilize c-Fos protein

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine whether KDM2B regulates c-Fos protein level, as well as its transcription, we
first generated HEK293 cells with stable knock down of KDM2B. KDM2B expresses
multiple isoforms produced by alternative splicing and differential transcriptional initiation.
KDM2B-1 (NM_032590) is the longest and likely the full-length isoform and carries the
histone demethylase JmjC domain, while KDM2B-2 (NM_013910) is translated from an
mRNA initiated at an internal promoter of the KDM2B-1 transcript and lacks the JmjC
domain and (Figure S1A). We first determined the subcellular localization and found that
both long and short isoforms of KDM2B localized in the nucleus (Figure S1B). We then
characterized three short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting different regions of KDM2B. We
found that shKDM2B#1 targeted KDM2B-1 (upper-migrating) only and shKDM2B#2
targeted both of KDM2B-1 and KDM2B-2 effectively (Figure 1A). Notably, we found an
increase of c-Fos protein levels in cells stably expressing shKDM2B#1 and an even more
dramatic increase of c-Fos protein levels in cells stably expressing shKDM2B#2. This result
suggested that KDM2B negatively regulated c-Fos protein level and this function of
KDM2B did not require its JmjC domain-encoded histone demethylase activity. We next
examined whether KDM2B controls the stability of c-Fos protein. Due to the extremely low
basal level expression of c-Fos protein in un-stimulated cells, we established HEK293 cells
stably expressing FLAG-tagged c-Fos (Figure S1C). FLAG-c-Fos has a half-life (t1/2) of
approximately 18 minutes (Figure S1D), confirming that c-Fos is a very short-lived protein
undergoing rapid turnover. Treatment of cells with MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor,
effectively blocked c-Fos degradation (Figure S1E, S1F), confirming previous reports that cFos is degraded by the proteasome pathway (11, 12). Importantly, knockdown of KDM2B
effectively stabilized FLAG-c-Fos, extending its half-life from 18 minutes beyond 40
minutes of experimental duration (Figure 1B).

Author Manuscript

To determine the mechanism by which KDM2B negatively regulates c-Fos, we tested the
possibility that KDM2B promotes c-Fos degradation by binding to SKP1 and CUL1 through
its F-box. We first determined whether CUL1 affects c-Fos protein level. We found that
knockdown of CUL1 in HEK293 cells with two different siRNAs resulted in an approximate
six-fold increase of c-Fos protein levels without significant change in c-Fos mRNA levels
(Figure 1C). Likewise depletion of KDM2B or CUL1 in NHF1 normal human fibroblasts
also resulted in the accumulation of c-Fos (Figure 1D). Furthermore, co-depletion of both
KDM2B and CUL1 did not cause any additional increase of c-Fos protein level (Figure 1D),
suggesting that KDM2B and CUL1 act in the same pathway for controlling c-Fos. Together,
these results demonstrate that KDM2B plays a major role to target c-Fos protein degradation
by a CUL1-based E3 ligase. Following commonly accepted nomenclature, we refer to the
KDM2B-CUL1 E3 ligase as SCF/CRL1KDM2B where the substrate recruiter F-box protein
KDM2B is in superscript.

c-Fos is a substrate of SCFKDM2B/FBXL10 E3 ubiquitin ligase

To demonstrate that KDM2B assembles the SCFKDM2B ligase complex to target c-Fos
ubiquitylation, we examined its interaction with endogenous SCF E3 ligase complex
components. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays demonstrated that FLAG-tagged
KDM2B interacted with endogenous SKP1, CUL1 and ROC1 (Figure 2A). Meanwhile, we
also detected the interaction between FLAG-KDM2B and endogenous c-Fos (Figure 2A).
The F-box domain in F-box proteins is essential for its binding to SKP1 and thus, the
assembly of SCF complex (29-31). To determine the CUL1/SKP1-binding region in
KDM2B, we constructed various deletion mutants of KDM2B (Figure S2A). Co-IP assays
revealed that deletion of both leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and F-box domains from KDM2B
(ΔLRF), but not the LRRs only (ΔLRR), completely disrupted its binding to CUL1 (Figure
S2B). Consistently, the C-terminal of KDM2B (C300) containing the F-box and LRRs
strongly interacted with CUL1 (Figure S2B), suggesting that the F-box domain of KDM2B
is essential for its binding to CUL1. Structural analysis has previously shown that the Nterminal region of F-box domain in SKP2 is essential for its binding to SKP1 (32). Similar
to SKP2, deletion of 23 amino acids in the N-terminal half of the F-box domain from
KDM2B (residues 1056 to 1078, referred to as ΔF23) substantially reduced its binding to
CUL1, and deletion of 48 residues containing the entire F-box domain (residues 1057 -1105,
ΔF48) completely abolished its binding to CUL1 (Figure 2B). Two hydrophobic helical
surfaces in the N-terminal tip of CUL1, H2 and H5, pack with hydrophobic and polar
residues from SKP1 to form a large interface (32). Mutation of either helix in CUL1
significantly disrupted its binding to KDM2B (Figure 2C). Together, these results
demonstrate that KDM2B, via its F-box domain, assembles a bona fide SCF-type E3
ubiquitin ligase complex.

To demonstrate that endogenously expressed c-Fos binds to KDM2B in vivo, HEK293 cells
were treated with MG132 followed by immunoprecipitation using an antibody against c-Fos.
The interactions between c-Fos and KDM2B two isoforms translated by different promoters
were readily detected (Figure 2D, Figure S2C). A fragment containing the C-terminal 300
residues of KDM2B that includes the LRRs and F-box could bind c-Fos, and conversely,
deletion of the LRRs substantially reduced the binding of KDM2B with c-Fos (Figure S2D).
Deletion of the F-box from KDM2B (ΔF48) also reduced the interaction between KDM2B
and c-Fos (Figure 2E). These results indicate that the LRRs domain in KDM2B is mainly
responsible for the binding with the substrate c-Fos and that the F-box domain may also
contribute to the binding.

Author Manuscript

To demonstrate the ubiquitylation of c-Fos by the SCFKDM2B E3 ligase, we carried out both
in vivo and in vitro ubiquitylation assays. We first knocked down either CUL1 or KDM2B
and found that knocking down either gene reduced the ubiquitylation of endogenous c-Fos
(Figure 2F). An in vitro ubiquitylation assay demonstrated that the CUL1 E3
immunocomplexes efficiently ubiquitylated c-Fos, converting nearly all c-Fos into
ubiquitylated form (Figure 2G). The ubiquitylation of c-Fos was dependent on the addition
of E1 and E2, CUL1 E3 complex, substrate receptor KDM2B and substrate c-Fos. We
therefore conclude that c-Fos is a substrate of SCFKDM2B E3 ubiquitin ligase.

EGF stabilizes c-Fos by dissociating c-Fos from KDM2B/FBXL10

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The MEK/ERK signaling pathway activates c-Fos transcription in response to extracellular
growth factors such as EGF (9). Supporting this conclusion, EGF stimulation dramatically
increased the endogenous c-Fos protein as early as within 20 minutes, which was
compromised by the classical MEK1/2 (the ERK1/2 activating kinases) inhibitor U0126
(Figures S3A, S3B and S3C). In addition to transcriptional activation, MEK/ERK pathway
has also been reported to increase c-Fos level by stabilizing c-Fos protein through an
undefined mechanism that involves phosphorylation at Ser362 and Ser374 (11). We
therefore examined whether EGF stabilizes c-Fos protein through regulating SCFKDM2Bmediated c-Fos ubiquitylation. To separate from the intrinsically transcriptional regulation of
c-Fos, we took advantage of HEK293 cells that stably express ectopic FLAG-tagged c-Fos.
EGF treatment induced FLAG-c-Fos protein accumulation as early as within 20 minutes and
continuously in a time-dependent manner without significant change in FLAG-c-Fos mRNA
levels (Figure 3A). Consistently, EGF treatment stabilized FLAG-c-Fos in HEK293 cells,
extending its half-life from 15 minutes to 45 minutes (Figure 3B). Moreover, EGF-induced
c-Fos accumulation was blocked by MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and an ERK1/2 inhibitor,
SCH772984 (Figure 3C). Inhibition of translation by the treatment of cells with
cycloheximide (CHX) reduced the steady state level of c-Fos protein, but this reduction was
not seen in cells treated with EGF (Figure 3D), supporting a post-translational mechanism
by which EGF stabilizes c-Fos. Notably, the c-Fos protein accumulated in EGF-treated cells
was highly phosphorylated, as indicated by the appearance of a discrete slower migrating
band (Figures 3A-3D), supporting a previous notion that the phosphorylated form c-Fos is
resistant to the degradation.

To determine whether KDM2B is involved in the regulation of c-Fos by EGF, we first
examined the effect of KDM2B knockdown on EGF-induced c-Fos protein levels and found
that knockdown of KDM2B prolonged the high level of c-Fos protein following EGF
stimulation (Figure 3E). To determine how EGF stabilizes c-Fos, we next examined the
association between c-Fos and KDM2B in EGF-treated cells and found that EGF treatment
dissociated their binding in a time-dependent manner (Figure 3F). The reduction of c-Fos
and KDM2B interaction by EGF was completely blocked by U0126 (Figure 3G), a highly
selective inhibitor of both MEK1 and MEK2, suggesting the involvement of MEK/ERK
signaling pathway in the regulation of c-Fos association with KDM2B. TPA is a potent
tumor promoter that activates PKC signaling pathway (PKC-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK), which
causes phosphorylation of c-Fos and dissociates c-Fos from KDM2B. Consistently, we
found that TPA treatment decreased the association of KDM2B with c-Fos (Figure S3F) and
accumulated c-Fos protein (Figure S3D). Importantly, we found that knock down of
KDM2B stabilized c-Fos protein by in the presence of TPA (Figure S3E). Together, these
results demonstrate that c-Fos level is regulated at both transcriptional and posttranslational
levels and that c-Fos protein is stabilized by EGF-promoted phosphorylation which
dissociates c-Fos from its E3 ligase, KDM2B.
EGF-mediated phosphorylation at S374 stabilizes c-Fos and promotes cell proliferation
It has been previously reported that c-Fos can be stabilized by phosphorylation at several
sites, including S32, S362, S374 sites (11, 15) that are stimulated by ERK5 and ERK1/2

pathways. To determine which of these sites is involved in the ubiquitylation of c-Fos by the
SCFKDM2B E3 ligase, we established HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-c-Fos mutants
targeting individual serine residues. We found that a non-phosphorylatable mutation at S374
(S374A) completely abolished EGF-induced c-Fos stabilization and protein accumulation,
while S362A and S32A mutations had mild or no effect on EGF-induced increase of c-Fos
stability and steady state c-Fos level (Figures 4A & S4A). In contrast to S374A mutation, a
phosphomimetic mutation of S374 (S374D) dramatically extended the half-life of c-Fos
from approximately 18 minutes to more than 1 hour of the experimental duration (Figure
4B), whereas neither S32D nor S362D mutation had significant effect on c-Fos stability
(Figure S4B). Collectively, these results indicate that S374 is a major phosphorylation site
that contributes to c-Fos stabilization in response to EGF stimulation.

We next determined whether EGF-promoted c-Fos dissociation from KDM2B is mediated
by S374 phosphorylation. Western blot showed that the S374-phosphorylated form is closely
associated with the appearance of the slow-migrating form of c-Fos in EGF-treated cells that
are resistant to KDM2B binding (Figures 3A, 3E and S3A). We then expressed wild-type
and S374A mutant c-Fos and found that S374A mutation inhibited EGF-induced
dissociation of c-Fos from KDM2B (Figure 4C). Notably, S374-phosphorylated c-Fos, while
significantly induced by EGF, was not detected in the KDM2B immunocomplex (Figure
4D). Consistently, S374D mutation of c-Fos reduced its binding to KDM2B (Figure 4E).
EGF-induced cell proliferation was partially compromised by the expression of S374A
mutant of c-Fos and promoted by S374D mutation (Figure 4F, 4G). Consistently, c-Fos
S374D mutant that is resistant to KDM2B-mediated degradation is more potent than wildtype in activating target genes (Figure S4C). Together, these results demonstrate that EGFinduced phosphorylation at S374 in c-Fos disassociates it from KDM2B, resulting in
increased stability and level of c-Fos and contributing to cell proliferation.
KDM2B/FBXL10 inhibits cell proliferation via promoting c-Fos degradation

Author Manuscript

To determine the effect of KDM2B on cell proliferation, we first generated HeLa cells with
stable knock down of KDM2B which resulted in increased c-Fos protein levels (Figure 5A,
left panel). Re-introduction of wild-type, but not ΔF-box mutant (ΔF48), KDM2B reduced
the c-Fos protein level back to that similar in the parental HeLa cells (Figure 5A, right
panel). Consistent with increased level of c-Fos protein, ectopic expression of ΔF-box
mutant, but not the wild-type KDM2B, increased the rate of cell proliferation, and this effect
was not seen when c-Fos was knocked down (Figure 5B). EdU cell proliferation assay also
showed that KDM2B ΔF-box mutant lost its ability to suppress cell proliferation and
knockdown c-Fos reduced cell proliferation back to the rate similar to that seen in control
cells (Figure 5C, S5). We also examined several target genes of c-Fos linked to cell
proliferation and growth, including cyclin D1 (CCND1) involved in G1 cell cycle control,
matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) linked to embryonic development and tissue remodeling
and CD44 linked to cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion and migration. We found that the
accumulation of c-Fos resulting from reduced expression or dysfunction of KDM2B
increased the transcriptional level of these genes (Figure 5D). Together, these results
demonstrated that KDM2B-promoted c-Fos degradation contributes to its function in the
negative regulation of cell proliferation.

Tumor-derived mutations impair the function of KDM2B/FBXL10 to target c-Fos
degradation and suppress cell proliferation

Author Manuscript

Recent cancer genome sequencing efforts have identified a number of mutations targeting
KDM2B. For example, the COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database
reports 16 deletions and 7 nonsense mutations of KDM2B in different type of human
cancers (Figure S6). A loss of function of KDM2B could be viewed consistent with its
function in suppressing cell proliferation. Among these reported mutations are three,
C1085fs*14, W1161*, H1297fs*4, that predict to destroy the F-box or/and the leucine rich
repeats (LRRs) domains of KDM2B (Figure 6A). We therefore set to determine whether
these tumor-derived mutations affect the activity of KDM2B in promoting c-Fos degradation
and suppressing cell proliferation. We recreated all these three mutations and first examined
their effect on the binding of KDM2B with c-Fos. We found that all three mutations reduced
the binding of KDM2B with c-Fos when compared with the wild-type KDM2B expressed at
a similar level (Figure 6B). We next carried out in vivo ubiquitylation assay and
demonstrated that all three tumor-derived mutations in KDM2B evidently reduced the
activity of KDM2B in promoting c-Fos ubiquitylation (Figure 6C). Knockdown-replacement
experiment demonstrates that these three mutations also abolished the ability to decrease cFos protein (Figure 6D). We further demonstrated that all three tumor-derived mutants lost
the function of KDM2B in suppressing cell proliferation (Figure 6E). Together, these results
identify the first functional consequence linked to the tumor mutations in KDM2B.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

This paper reports two key findings. First, KDM2B/FBXL10 functions as a bona fide F-box
protein and assembles into an activate SCF/CRL1-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. KDM2B
contains a JmjC domain that catalyzes histone H3K36 demethylation. Our finding identifies
a second enzymatic activity to this multi-domain protein. Of 32 human histone demethylases
proteins, KDM2B, and its closest homologue, KDM2A/FBXL11, are the only two KDMs
that contain an F-box domain. The F-box domains encode by KDM2B and KDM2A/
FBXL11 are highly related (78%). Our results suggest that KDM2A/FBLX11, which, like
KDM2B, also catalyzes H3K36 demethylation and recognizes CpG through its JmjC and
CxxC domains (33), is likely to form a functional SCF E3 ligase. It remains to be
determined whether and how these two enzymatic activities are mechanistically linked in
gene regulation. It will also be interesting to determine whether KDM2B catalyzes
ubiquitylation of any subunit of PRC1 complex or a histone.

Author Manuscript

Second, c-Fos is robustly ubiquitylated and degraded by SCFKDM2B E3 ligase. As an
immediate early gene, c-Fos level is rapidly accumulated by both transcriptional activation
and protein stabilization, thereby conferring cells the ability to rapidly regulate AP-1 target
genes during stress and mitogenic responses. Our finding provides a mechanism—
dissociating c-Fos from its E3 ligase by EGF-promoted phosphorylation at S374—for cells
to stabilize c-Fos protein in response to mitogenic stimulation. Our observations also provide
a plausible explanation for the previously observed inhibition of c-Jun- and c-Fos-mediated
transcriptional activity by KDM2B (14, 28). Conversely, this mechanism allows cells to
maintain the c-Fos at a very low after withdrawal of the mitogenic stimulation through

turning off the c-Fos transcription and constitutive degradation of c-Fos protein once the
S374 is dephosphorylated. Many other SCF substrates are also regulated by phosphorylation
which targets a small motif, known as degron, and promotes the substrate to bind with an Fbox protein and be degraded by the SCF ligase. Linking signal-dependent phosphorylation
to ubiquitylation provides cells an efficient mechanism to regulate protein function through
crosstalk between different posttranslational modifications. The finding reported here further
expands the spectrum of this crosstalk.

For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were washed with cold phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) once and lysed in a NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
0.5% NP-40 and supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors) for 1 h
at 4°C with gentle shaking. 10% of cell lysates were mixed directly with 5x Laemmli sample
buffer and used as input on western blot. The 90% cell lysates were incubated with specific
antibody for 3 h at 4°C, followed by addition of protein A conjugated beads for 1 h at 4°C.
Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted
from beads with 50 μL 1x Laemmli loading buffer.

For western blotting, cells were washed with cold PBS once and lysed in 1x Laemmli
loading buffer directly or in NP-40 buffer if used for a subsequent immunoprecipitation.
Lysates were heated at 99°C for 5 min, and resolved on 8-15% SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline
and Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with a primary
antibody overnight at 4°C, and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was imaged either by a Typhoon
Scanner (GE healthcare) or a LAS 4000 Imager system (GE healthcare).
In vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assay
The procedures for both assays were modified from our previously published report (35).
Briefly, for in vivo ubiquitylation assay, at 36-48 h after transfection, cells were treated with
proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (20μM) for 6 h to accumulate polyubiquinated c-Fos and thus

increase the sensitivity of detection. Cells were collected and lysed in 1% SDS lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT) and boiled for 10 min. For
immunoprecipitation, the clarified SDS lysates were diluted 10-fold in 0.5% NP-40 lysis
buffer, 10% of total lysates were mixed directly with 5x Laemmli sample buffer and used as
input on western blot. The rest were incubated with anti-c-Fos antibody for 3 h at 4°C,
followed by addition of protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed
3 times with lysis buffer and boiled in 1x Laemmli loading buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. The
ubiquitylation levels of c-Fos were determined by immunoblot with anti-Ub antibody.

For in vitro ubiquitylation assay, plasmids expressing different genes, as indicated in the
figures, were transfected into HEK293T cells. 48 hours after transfection, cells were lysed in
NP-40 lysis buffer supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors and phosphatase
inhibitors, followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-c-MYC agarose (A7470, SigmaAldrich) or anti-HA Sepharose (sc-7392 AC, Santa Cruz). Immunocomplexes were washed
with the lysis buffer 3 times and eluted with MYC (EQKLISEEDL) or HA (YPYDVPDYA)
antigen peptides, respectively. 3HA-c-Fos protein was immunopurified and used as the
substrate. CUL1-based E3 ligase complex and substrate receptor KDM2B were derived from
HEK293 cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing MYC-CUL1, ROC1 and SKP1 or
singularly transfected with plasmid expressing MYC-KDM2B, respectively. In vitro
ubiquitylation was initiated by mixing the substrate with immunopurified E3 complex and
KDM2B in a ubiquitin ligation buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM
NaF, 2 mM ATP, 10 nM okadaic acid (Beyotime Biotechnology), 0.6 mM DTT, 12 μg of
bovine ubiquitin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 μg of FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (Sigma-Aldrich), 60 ng of
E1 (E301, Boston Biochem), 500 ng of E2 (human Ubc5c), final volume: 30 μL]. The
reactions were incubated at 37°C for 1 h on a rotator with gentle shaking, then terminated
with SDS sample buffer and boiled at 99°C for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE. The
ubiquitylation levels of c-Fos were determined by immunoblot with either anti-FLAG or
anti-HA antibody.
RNA interference
RNAi-mediated down-regulation of human KDM2B, CUL1 was performed by transfecting
small interference RNAs (siRNAs) into HEK293 cells in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions of Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Life Technologies). A nontargeting control siRNA duplex (sense 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′) was
included as a negative control. The knockdown efficiency was assessed 72 h after
transfection by western blot.

Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. 2-5 μg total RNA was reversely transcribed with
oligo-dT primers and preceded to qRT-PCR with gene-specific primers in the presence of
SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa). All data was performed in triplicate and β-actin (ACTB)
was used as a housekeeping control. Relative abundance of mRNA was determined in 7500
real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Primers (FLAG-c-FOS-F/R) were designed to
specifically detect the ectopic FLAG-tagged c-Fos, but not endogenous c-Fos FLAG-c-FOS.

(A) Stable knock down of KDM2B increases endogenous c-Fos protein level. Two distinct
bands of KDM2B (170 KDa and 120 KDa, respectively) were observed in HEK293 cells,
representing the two isoforms. The protein and mRNA levels of c-Fos were determined by
western blot and qRT-PCR, respectively, and normalized against β-actin. Error bars
represent ±SD for triplicate experiments.
(B) Ectopically expressed c-Fos is stabilized by knock down of KDM2B. HEK293 cells
stably expressing FLAG-c-Fos were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides targeting
KDM2B or control siRNA. 72 hours after siRNA transfection, the half-life of FLAG-c-Fos
protein levels was determined by cycloheximide (CHX, 20 mg/L) chase assay and
normalized against β-actin. Error bars represent ±SD for triplicate experiments.
(C) Knock down of CUL1 increases c-Fos protein level. HEK293 cells were transfected with
two different siRNAs targeting CUL1 or a control siRNA. 72 h after transfection, the protein
and mRNA levels of c-Fos were determined by western blot and qRT-PCR respectively and
normalized against β-actin. Error bars represent ±SD for duplicate experiments.
(D) Knock down of either KDM2B or CUL1 or combination increases c-Fos protein to a
similar level. NHF1 cells and HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides
targeting either KDM2B or CUL1 individually or in combination. The protein and mRNA
levels of c-Fos were determined by western blot and qRT-PCR, respectively, and normalized
against β-actin. Error bars represent ±SD for triplicate experiments.

(A) EGF induces c-Fos protein accumulation in a time-dependent manner. HEK293 cells
stably expressing FLAG-tagged c-Fos were deprived of serum for 8 h, and then treated with
50 μg/L EGF for the indicated length of time. The protein and mRNA levels of FLAG-c-Fos
were determined by western blot and qRT-PCR, respectively, and normalized against βactin. Error bars represent ±SD for triplicate experiments.
(B) EGF stabilizes c-Fos. HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged c-Fos were
pretreated with or without EGF (50 μg/L) for 30 min, followed by CHX treatment (20 mg/L)
for the indicated time. The protein levels of c-Fos were determined by western blot and
normalized against β-actin. Error bars represent ±SD for triplicate experiments.
(C) EGF-induced c-Fos accumulation is blocked by MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and an
ERK1/2 inhibitor (SCH772984). HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-c-Fos were
deprived of serum for 8 h, followed by treatment with U0126 (2 μM) or SCH772984 (0.2 or
1 μM) for 5 min. EGF (50 μg/L) was then added for additional 30 min. The protein levels of
c-Fos were determined by western blot and normalized against β-actin.
(D) EGF-induced c-Fos accumulation is not affected by inhibition of protein synthesis.
HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged c-Fos were treated with CHX (20 mg/L) for 5
min or 10 min. Solvent or EGF (50 μg/L) was then added for further treatment for 30 min.
The protein levels of FLAG-c-Fos were determined by western blot and normalized against
β-actin. Data are shown as relative fold change over protein levels in cells without EGF
treatment. The arrow represents highly phosphorylated c-Fos

shown as relative fold change over cells without EGF treatment (right panel).
(F) EGF treatment induces c-Fos S374 phosphorylation and concomitantly reduces the
interaction between c-Fos and KDM2B. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids
expressing indicated proteins and then treated with EGF (50 μg/L) for the indicated length of
time. The interactions between c-Fos and KDM2B were determined by Co-IP.
(G) The reduction of c-Fos and KDM2B interaction by EGF is blocked by U0126. FLAGKDM2B and 3HA-c-Fos were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. Cells were pretreated with
U0126 (2 μM) for 5 min and then treated with EGF (50 μg/L) for another 30 min. The
interactions between c-Fos and KDM2B were determined by Co-IP.

(A) Mutation of S374 site to alanine abolishes EGF-induced c-Fos protein accumulation.
HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged c-Fos were deprived of serum for 8 h, and
then treated with EGF (50 μg/L) for 30 min. The protein and mRNA levels of FLAG-c-Fos
were determined by western blot and qRT-PCR, respectively, and normalized against βactin. Data are shown as relative fold change over cells without EGF treatment. Error bars
represent ±SD for duplicate experiments.
(B) Mutation of S374 site to aspartic acid renders c-Fos resistant to degradation. HEK293
cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged c-Fos WT or S374D mutant were treated with 20mg/L
CHX for the indicated length of time. The half-life of c-Fos protein levels were determined
by western blot and normalized against β-actin (Bottom). Error bars represent ±SD for
triplicate experiments.
(C) The reduction of c-Fos and KDM2B interaction by EGF is inhibited by c-Fos S374A
mutant. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing indicated proteins and
then treated with or without EGF (50 μg/L) for 30 min. The interactions between c-Fos and
KDM2B were determined by Co-IP.
(D) KDM2B preferentially interacts with S374 non-phosphorylatable c-Fos. HEK293 cells
were co-transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins and then treated with or
without EGF (50 μg/L) for 30min. The FLAG-KDM2B was immunoprecipitated and
western blot was performed to detect the co-precipitated c-Fos with indicated antibodies. *
indicates the heavy chain background around 55 KDa.
(E) S374D mutation of c-Fos hinders its binding to KDM2B. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing indicated proteins, and the interactions between c-Fos
and KDM2B were determined by Co-IP.

(F) EGF-induced cell proliferation is compromised by S374A mutant of c-Fos. HEK293
cells stably expressing FLAG-c-Fos WT or S374A mutant were cultured in the absence of
serum and treated with or without EGF (100 μg/L) for 0, 1, 2 or 3 days, as indicated. EGF
was replenished every day. Cell numbers were counted each day. Western blot was
performed to show FLAG-c-Fos protein levels on the 3rd day. * denotes the p < 0.05 for
cells stably expressing S374A mutant versus wild-type c-Fos under EGF treatment. Error
bars represent ±SD for triplicate experiments.
(G) c-Fos S374D mutant is more potent than wild-type in promoting cell proliferation.
HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-c-Fos wild-type or S374D mutant were cultured in
the absence of serum for 0, 1, 2 or 3 days, as indicated. Cell numbers were counted each day.
Western blot was performed to show FLAG-c-Fos protein levels on the 3rd day. * denotes
the p < 0.05 for cells stably expressing S374D mutant versus wild-type c-Fos. Error bars
represent ±SD for triplicate experiments.

(A) KDM2B ΔF-box mutant abolished its function in promoting c-Fos degradation. FLAGtagged wild-type or ΔF-box mutant of KDM2B was stably expressed in HeLa cells stably
knocking down of KDM2B. Stable cells were transfected with siRNA targeting Fos or
control siRNA as indicated. The protein levels of c-Fos were determined by western blot and
normalized against β-actin.
(B) ΔF-box mutant lose the function of KDM2B in suppressing cell proliferation, and this
effect is compromised by c-Fos knockdown. Stable HeLa cells identified as in Figure 5A
were transfected with siRNAs targeting Fos. Cell numbers were counted each day. Error bars
represent ±SD for triplicate experiments.
(C) ΔF-box mutant lose the function of KDM2B in inhibiting DNA synthesis, and this effect
is compromised by c-Fos knockdown. Stable HeLa cells identified as in Figure 5A were
transfected with siRNAs targeting Fos and labelled with 10 μM EdU for 1 h. The percentage
of EdU-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry, indicating the percentage of Sphase cells in the population. Error bars represent ±SD for triplicate experiments.
(D) Knock down of KDM2B increases the transcriptional level of c-Fos-targeting genes,
which is compromised by put-back of wild-type, but not ΔF-box mutant KDM2B. Stable
HeLa cells identified as in Figure 5A were transfected with siRNAs targeting Fos. The
mRNA levels of genes were determined by qRT-PCR respectively and normalized against βactin. Error bars represent ±SD for triplicate experiments.

(A) Schematic representations of three tumor-derived mutants of KDM2B examined in this
study. Additional tumor-derived mutations in KDM2B are shown in Figure S6.
(B) Tumor-derived mutations in KDM2B impair their binding to c-Fos. HEK293 cells were
transfected with plasmids expressing indicated proteins. The interactions between WT or
mutant KDM2B and c-Fos were determined by Co-IP.
(C) Tumor-derived mutations in KDM2B impair their ability to ubiquitylate c-fos in vivo.
HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing indicated proteins and treated with
20 μM MG132 for 6 h. Endogenous c-Fos was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with
an antibody specific against ubiquitin.
(D) Tumor-derived mutants of KDM2B abolish their function in promoting c-Fos
degradation. HeLa cells with stable knockdown of KDM2B were established by lentivirus
transduction. FLAG-tagged wild-type or tumor-derived mutants KDM2B was then stably
expressed in these cells. The protein levels of c-Fos were determined by western blot and
normalized against β-actin.
(E) Tumor-derived mutations lose the function of KDM2B in suppressing cell proliferation.
Sable HeLa cells were identified as in Figure 6D. Cell numbers were counted each day.
Error bars represent ±SD for triplicate experiments.
