Abstract
Constitutive activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway
occurs frequently in cancer cells and contributes to
oncogenesis. Among the members of STAT family, STAT3
plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of
human tumors. The STAT3-mediated signaling pathway has
been recognized as a promising anticancer target. Here, we
show that 17-Hydroxy-jolkinolide B (HJB), a diterpenoid from
the Chinese medicinal herb Euphorbia fischeriana Steud,
strongly inhibits interleukin (IL)-6–induced as well as
constitutive STAT3 activation. Furthermore, we show that
HJB directly targets the JAK family kinases, JAK1, JAK2, and
TYK2, by inducing dimerization of the JAKs via cross-linking.
Addition of DTT or glutathione prevents the JAK crosslinking and blocks the inhibitory effects of HJB on IL-6–
induced STAT3 activation, suggesting that HJB may react
with cystein residues of JAKs to form covalent bonds that
inactivate JAKs. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
analysis confirmed that each HJB reacted with two thiols.
The effect of HJB on the JAK/STAT3 pathway is specific as
HJB has no effect on platelet-derived growth factor,
epidermal growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor I
signaling pathways. Finally, we show that HJB inhibits growth
and induces apoptosis of tumor cells, particularly those
tumor cells with constitutively activated STAT3. We propose
that the natural compound HJB is a promising anticancer
drug candidate as a potent STAT3 signaling inhibitor. [Cancer

Introduction
The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) pathway is responsible for signal transduction of a large number of cytokines. STATs are a family of seven
proteins, named STAT1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6, and JAKs represent a
family of four nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, JAK1, JAK2, TYK2, and
JAK3 (1–3). All JAKs (except JAK3, which is restricted to
hematopoietic cells) are expressed universally. After the cytokines

bind to their cognate receptors, the JAKs are activated and proceed
to phosphorylate the STATs. The phosphorylated STATs then form
homodimers or heterodimers via reciprocal phosphotyrosine-SH2
domain interaction and translocate into the nucleus to regulate
expression of target genes (4–6). Different cytokines activate
different STATs (7).
Constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, particularly
those in which STAT3 is involved, is frequently associated with
cancer (8–10). Persistent STAT3 phosphorylation is observed in a
number of human cancers including blood malignancies (leukemia,
lymphomas, and multiple myeloma) and solid tumors (melanoma,
head and neck, breast, lung, and prostate cancer; refs. 8, 11–18). It
has been suggested that STAT3 acts as an oncogene (4, 19). All JAK
family members are in vivo kinases for STAT3 and the JAKs are also
frequently found to be activated in cancers and other proliferative
diseases. The TEL-JAK2 fusion protein found in acute lymphoblastic leukemias with the t(9;12) translocation causes constitutive
activation of JAK2 (20). Additionally, an activating mutation in
JAK2 (V617F) is found in majority of patients with polycythemia
vera and with other myeloproliferative disorders such as essential
thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis (21–23). Recently,
it has been reported that overexpression of the JAKs promoted
in vitro cell transformation (6). Its potential role in these disorders
makes the JAK/STAT3 pathway an attractive target in therapeutic
settings, where inappropriate or excessive cytokine signaling
occurs (24, 25). Importantly, small-molecule inhibitors of the
JAK/STAT3 pathway have been reported to be effective anticancer
agents in vitro and in animal models (11, 26–35).
The dried plant roots of Euphorbia fischeriana Steud (Euphorbiaceae), known as ‘‘lang-du’’ in traditional Chinese medicine,
have long been used for the treatment of cancer, edema, and ascites
(36–39). Diterpenoids are major chemical constituents of the roots
constituting f0.1% of the plant’s total mass. Although it has been
used in herbal medicine for thousands of years, the molecular target
and mode of action of this traditional Chinese medicine remain
unclear.
We identified 17-Hydroxy-jolkinolide B (HJB), an ent-abietane
diterpene diepoxide from Euphorbia fischeriana Steud, as a potent
inhibitor of JAK/STAT3 signaling. It inactivated the JAK family
kinases: JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 by covalent cross-linking of the
JAKs. The effects of HJB on the JAK/STAT3 signaling are specific. It
did not affect many other growth factors signaling. Furthermore,
HJB inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of tumor cells,
particularly those with constitutively activated STAT3. Above all,
our data explains how Euphorbia fischeriana Steud may work in
cancer treatment and suggest that HJB may be a promising anticancer drug candidate.

A Novel JAK/STAT3 Pathway Inhibitor HJB

Figure 1. HJB inhibited IL-6–induced as well as constitutive activation of STAT3 in human tumor cell lines. A, HepG2/STAT3 cells were pretreated with HJB at
indicated concentrations for 2 h, and luciferase activity was measured following stimulation of IL-6 (10 ng/mL) for 5 h. B, HepG2 cells were pretreated with HJB for 2 h
before stimulation by IL-6 (10 ng/mL) for 15 min. Whole cell lysates were processed for Western blot analysis and probed with the indicated antibodies. h-Actin
served as a loading control. C, HepG2 cells were pretreated with 5 Amol/L HJB for various lengths of time (0–120 min) before stimulation by IL-6 for 10 min.
Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. D, HepG2 cells and MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 were treated with HJB at indicated concentrations
for 2 h. Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. Densitometric quantification of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 normalized to total STAT3 was
graphed below the corresponding blots.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of HJB. The preparation of HJB has been described
previously (39), and the compound was dissolved in 100% DMSO before use.
Cell lines and culture. HepG2/STAT3 cells, gifts of Prof. Xinyuan Fu
(National University of Singapore, Singapore), were HepG2 cells stably
transfected with a STAT3-responsive firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. All
other cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Plasmids and transfection. JAK2 expression plasmid in cytomegalovirusbased vector was a gift from Prof. David E. Levy (New York University,
New York, NY). Flag-JAK2 and HA-JAK2 were generated by PCR followed
by cloning into pFlag-CMV4 and pcDNA3-HA, respectively. pMT2T-TYK2
expression plasmid was a gift from Prof. John Krolewski (University of
California, Irvine, CA). Human full-length JAK1 cDNA was isolated from
human thymus plasmid cDNA library (Clontech) using standard PCR
techniques, and subsequently cloned into pFlag-CMV4. The constructs were
confirmed by sequencing. pEGFP-N1 was obtained from Clonetech.
Transient transfection of HEK 293 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Western blot analysis. Whole cell lysates were prepared in 1 Laemmli
sample buffer (Sigma) to extract total proteins. Equivalent amounts of total
cellular protein were electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). Membranes were
blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for
1 h at room temperature, and then incubated with primary antibodies in 5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST at 4jC overnight. Membranes were
then washed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase–

www.aacrjournals.org

conjugated secondary antibody in 5% BSA in TBST for 1 h at room
temperature. Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).
Antibodies used in Western blotting were mouse anti-STAT3, mouse
anti–pY-STAT3, rabbit anti-JAK1, rabbit anti-TYK2, rabbit anti-GP130,
rabbit anti–poly ADP ribose polymerase, rabbit anti–epidermal growth
factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR), rabbit anti–platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF) receptor (PDGFR), rabbit anti–phospho-insulin-like growth factor
(IGF-I) receptor (IGF-IR), and rabbit anti–IGF-IR (Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti–phospho-EGFR and rabbit anti–phospho-PDGFR (Biosource); mouse anti–h-Actin (Sigma); and rabbit anti-JAK2 and rabbit
anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Kinase assay. The JAK kinase assay was performed using HTScan JAK
kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) with JAK immunoprecipitates. Briefly, HEK 293 cells were transfected with JAK1, JAK2, or TYK2
expression plasmid for 24 h, then lysed in 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4),
0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 2 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmol/L sodium fluoride, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor cocktail (1:1,000; Sigma)
on ice. Sample lysates were collected and cleared, and then 500 Ag of
lysates were immunoprecipitated with 400 ng antibodies specific for
JAK1, JAK2, or TYK2 for 1 h at 4jC and rocked with 25 AL of protein
A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for overnight at 4jC.
Samples were then washed thrice with lysis buffer and once with kinase
reaction buffer [60 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L
MnCl2, 3 Amol/L Na3VO4, 0.5 mmol/L DTT]. Then kinase reaction was
performed with the JAK immunoprecipitates and the HTScan JAK kinase

assay kit at 30jC for 30 min in a final volume of 50 AL of reaction buffer
containing 20 Amol/L ATP and 1.5 Amol/L peptide substrate. Samples
were pretreated with DMSO (vehicle control) or different concentration
of HJB before addition of ATP. Kinase activity was measured according
to manufacturer’s instruction.
MTT assay. About 5,000 cells per well were seeded into 96-well plates.
Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with vehicle control (DMSO) or
increasing concentrations of HJB for 72 h. MTT assay was performed as
described (40).
Luciferase assay. HepG2/STAT3 cells (1.5  105 per well) were seeded
into 24-well cell culture microplates (Corning) and allowed to grow for
24 h and then treated with test samples for 2 h followed by stimulation
with 10 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-6 (BD Biosciences) for 5 h. Luciferase
activity was determined using the Promega luciferase kits according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. The cell number was counted at seeding
and was controlled by equal seeding. All luciferase assay experiments

were repeated at least thrice to minimize the difference caused by cell
number.
Conjugation of HJB with glutathione. HJB (20 nmol) in DMSO
was incubated with 4 eq of reduced glutathione in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5) for 1 h at 37jC. Then the sample was injected in the liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system using methanol/water
(1:1) as the mobile phase at a rate of 0.2 mL/min, ESI-positive mode. High
performance liquid chromatography analysis was performed using an
Angilent HP 1100 series HPLC system (Angilent Technologies). Mass
spectrometry was recorded using a LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer
(ThermoFinnigan).
Silver staining. BSA (2 Amol/L) in cell lysis buffer were treated with
vehicle (DMSO), 10 or 100 Amol/L of HJB for 2 h at 37jC, and then
boiled in 2 Laemmli sample buffer and run on 8% SDS-PAGE. Silver
staining (GE Healthcare) was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Results
HJB inhibited IL-6–induced and constitutive STAT3
activation. In an attempt to discover novel anticancer drugs from
natural products targeting the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway,
traditional Chinese medicinal herb extracts, which have been
historically used to treat cancer and inflammation, were screened
by using a IL-6–induced STAT3-responsive luciferase reporter assay.
HJB, a diterpene diepoxide from the Euphorbiaceous extracts, was
found to strongly inhibit the IL-6–induced STAT3-responsive
luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The halfmaximal inhibition dose was f3.34 Amol/L. To map the action site
of HJB along the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, the effect of HJB on
IL-6–induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, which is a prerequisite for STAT3 biological activity, was examined. HJB inhibited the
IL-6–induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in a dose-dependent
fashion (Fig. 1B) and, at 10 Amol/L, completely inhibited the IL-6–
induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). The inhibition
was rapid; treatment of HepG2 cells with 5 Amol/L HJB for as few as
15 min was effective (Fig. 1C). HJB showed similar inhibitory effects
on constitutive STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in HepG2, MDAMB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 1D). The latter two breast
tumor cell lines have been reported to express persistently activated
STAT3, and the continued growth and survival of these cells seem
to rely on STAT3 signaling (30, 32). Therefore, HJB inhibited both
IL-6–induced and constitutive activation of STAT3.

HJB covalently cross-linked JAKs and inhibited their kinase
activities. The ability of HJB to suppress IL-6–induced STAT3
tyrosine phosphorylation suggests that this agent might interfere
with the upstream components of STAT3 signaling pathway,
prompting closer analysis of the effects of HJB on GP130 and JAK
family members JAK2, JAK1, and TYK2. It was found that the
protein levels of the JAKs were dramatically reduced in a dosedependent manner upon HJB treatment, whereas the protein level
of the upstream receptor GP130 was not affected (Fig. 2A). To
understand the mechanism through which HJB affects the JAK
protein levels, JAK2, JAK1, and TYK2 were overexpresed in HEK 293
cells. After HJB treatment, the proteins were analyzed. Although a
similar reduction of protein level of the 130-kDa, JAK2 was
observed upon HJB treatment, and immunoblots showed the
appearance of a high molecular mass (f260 kDa, twice the
molecular mass of JAK2) protein, which was recognized by the antiJAK2 antibody upon HJB treatment (Fig. 2B). Similar effects were
observed on JAK1 and TYK2 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that HJB may
covalently cross-link two JAKs into a dimer, and the JAKs may be
the direct targets of HJB.
Because the effects of HJB on the JAKs were similar, the major
STAT3 kinase JAK2 was chosen to further study how HJB works. To
understand the nature of the JAK2 containing high molecular mass
complex induced by HJB, tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
was used to analyze the purified complex. Only JAK2 protein

sequences were identified in the high molecular mass complex
(Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that HJB elicits JAK2
homotypic dimerization. To independently verify the dimerization
of JAK2 by HJB, two tagged JAK2 expression plasmids, HA-JAK2 and
Flag-JAK2, were cotransfected into HEK293 cells, and the two
tagged JAK2 proteins were analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation
assays after treatment with HJB. The results showed that HA-JAK2,
as well as GP130, were coimmunoprecipitated with Flag-JAK2
under normal conditions (Fig. 2C). After HJB treatment, the three
proteins could still be coimmunoprecipitated; the high molecular
mass band immunoprecipitated by the anti-Flag antibody, however,
contained only the two tagged JAK proteins (Fig. 2C), suggesting

www.aacrjournals.org

that a JAK2 dimer was formed. No GP130 could be detected in the
high molecular mass band (Fig. 2C), ruling out the possibility that
the high molecular mass band is a complex of JAK2 and GP130.
To determine whether the HJB-induced covalent cross-linking of
JAKs affected their kinase activities, the effects of HJB on JAK1,
JAK2, and TYK2 enzymatic activity were analyzed in vitro. The
results indicated that the kinase activities of all the JAKs were
efficiently inhibited by HJB in vitro (Fig. 2D), leading to the
conclusion that the cross-linking of JAKs by HJB inactivated their
activities.
The effects of HJB on JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway were
specific. To investigate whether the modification of JAKs by HJB is

specific, the effects of HJB on two randomly chosen proteins, BSA
and GFP, were analyzed in vitro and compared with that of
JAK2. HJB cross-linked JAK2 in vitro in a time-dependent fashion
(Fig. 3A), whereas no changes occurred to BSA or GFP after HJB
treatment (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the effects of HJB on JAKs was
not due to nonspecific cross-linking of proteins.
The effects of HJB on a panel of kinases by in vitro kinase assays
were also analyzed. At 50 Amol/L concentration, HJB had very little
inhibitory effect on all of the kinases analyzed except one, the
IKK-h, confirming the specificity of HJB toward the JAK family
proteins (Supplementary Table S1).
To further investigate the specificity of HJB on signaling
pathways, the effects of HJB on growth factors including EGF,
PDGF, and IGF-I were examined. HJB did not affect any of these
growth factor signaling pathways (Fig. 3C), again suggesting that
HJB acted selectively on the JAK/STAT3 pathway.
HJB interacted with thiol groups of the JAKs and inhibited
STAT3 activation in a thiol-dependent manner. Because HJB
contains epoxy groups and a a, h-unsaturated carbonyl group,
which are reactive with thiols, speculation arose regarding whether
the modification of the JAKs by HJB was through reaction with
thiol groups of the cysteins in the JAK proteins. If so, other thiolcontaining reagents may compete with the cysteins of JAKs for HJB
and alleviate the effects of HJB on JAKs. As shown in Fig. 4A, the
induction of the high molecular mass form of JAKs by HJB was
indeed abrogated in the presence of the thiol-containing reagent
DTT or reduced glutathione. Accordingly, the inhibition of IL-6–
induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation by HJB was also abolished
in the presence of DTT or GSH (Fig. 4B); so was the inhibition of
the IL-6–induced STAT3-responsive luciferase reporter activity by
HJB (Fig. 4C). These results showed that HJB inhibited the JAK/
STAT3 signaling pathway through interacting with the cystein thiol
groups of the JAKs.
To further understand the HJB-thiol interaction, HJB was
incubated with GSH, and the products were examined using
LC-MS. The analysis detected one major component at m/z 961.2
[HJB + H + 2GSH]+, indicating the addition of two molecules of
GSH to one molecule of HJB (Fig. 4D). The proposed reaction sites
of HJB are illustrated in Fig. 4D. Taken together, the results provided
strong evidence in support of the observation that HJB reacts with
thiols and induces dimerization of the JAKs.

HJB inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of tumor
cells. STAT3 transmits cell survival signals and protects cells
from apoptosis. Constitutive activation of STAT3 has been
associated with a number of cancers. Therefore, the effects of
HJB on growth and survival of a panel of human tumor cell lines
from different tissues were examined. HJB inhibited growth and
survival of all the tumor cells tested and the IC50 values for most
of the cell lines were under 10 Amol/L (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, it
was shown that HJB induced apoptosis in the human cancer cells,
as indicated by the induction of PARP cleavage (data not shown;
Fig. 5B).
During the examination of the HJB effects on the breast cancer
cell lines, it was noticed that HJB induced significantly more death
in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (which had constitutively
activated STAT3) than in the MDA-MB-453 cells, which lacked
constitutive STAT3 activation (Fig. 5C and D). Taken together, the
data showed the potential of HJB to inhibit growth and induce
apoptosis of human cancer cells, particularly those with constitutively activated STAT3.
The effects of HJB on STAT3 activation and cell viability were
stronger than that of JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490. Because we
observed that HJB affected JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 proteins, it seems
likely that HJB acts as a pan-JAK inhibitor. To evaluate the potential
application of HJB as an anticancer agent, HJB was compared with a
JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490 (41, 42) for their effects on STAT3
activation and on inducing tumor cell death. We observed that HJB
exhibited much more potent inhibition on IL-6–induced STAT3
activation and cell viability than AG490 (Fig. 6). Taken together,
these results suggest that HJB, as a pan-JAK inhibitor, may inhibit
STAT3 activation and tumor cell growth more strongly than specific
JAK inhibitors.

Discussion
Euphorbia fischeriana Steud has long been used as a folk
medicine to treat cancer in China. However, little has been
discovered about how it works. HJB is one of the major
diterpenoids from the plant. Thus, elucidating the function and
molecular mechanism of HJB in inhibiting tumor cell growth will
help us to understand and to better use this traditional Chinese

A Novel JAK/STAT3 Pathway Inhibitor HJB

HJB was identified as a potent inhibitor of the JAK/STAT3
signaling pathway. It inhibited the constitutive as well as the IL-6–
induced activation of STAT3, and induced apoptosis in human
cancer cells. Furthermore, the direct target of HJB was discovered
to be the JAK family kinases—HJB inhibited JAK kinase activities by
covalently cross-linking the JAK proteins into high molecular mass,
possibly dimeric, forms of the JAKs.
There are several lines of evidences to suggest that HJB induces
the dimerization of JAKs. First, HJB contains two epoxy groups and
a a, h-unsaturated carbonyl group, both of which are thiol reactive.
Either of the functional groups in HJB may form adducts with the
thiols of the cysteins in the JAK proteins. The LC-MS analysis
confirmed that two molecules of GSH were added to one molecule
of HJB in vitro (Fig. 4D). Thus, HJB is capable of interacting with
two cysteins of its target proteins. Second, the 130-kDa forms of the
JAK proteins switched into double-sized 260-kDa forms in a dosedependent manner upon HJB treatment (Fig. 2B) and the switching
was thiol dependent (Fig. 4A), suggesting that covalent bounds
involving cysteins were formed between two JAKs by HJB
treatment. Third, using LC-MS/MS analysis and coimmunoprecipitation assays with two tagged JAK2, it was directly shown that HJB
did induce the formation of a homodimer of JAK2 (Fig. 2C;
Supplementary Fig. S1).
The effects of HJB on JAK/STAT3 signaling are specific. HJB is
not a general cross-linking reagent because it did not induce crosslinking in randomly picked proteins such as BSA and GFP (Fig. 3B),
nor did it cross-link many other cellular proteins analyzed during
the study. HJB did not even cross-link JAKs to their upstream
receptor GP130 (Fig. 2C), which is physically associated with the
JAKs. The inhibition of HJB on JAKs kinase activities is also specific.
HJB had very little inhibitory effects on all of the kinases that were
analyzed except IKK-h (Supplementary Table S1). It was previously
reported that an HJB analogue, 17-Acetyl-jolkinolide B, also
inhibited IKK kinase activity by covalent thiol modification (40);
however, HJB does not cross-link IKK into a dimer (data not
shown), indicating that the effects of HJB on the JAKs are quite
unique—it may require an appropriate tertiary protein structure of
the JAK family proteins for a specific compound-protein interaction. The JAK family members have substantial amino acid
similarity and homology (1, 2, 43). There are f10 conserved
cystein residues in each of the JAK family members and across the
species, and we infer that these conserved cysteins are responsible
for the HJB-induced cross-linking of the JAKs. Furthermore, HJB
had no effects on EGFR, PDGFR, or IGF-IR signaling (Fig. 3C),
indicating that HJB has the potential to be a JAK/STAT3 signaling
pathway-specific inhibitor.
Specific inhibition of abnormally expressed or activated kinases is
a popular strategy for the development of anticancer drugs. For

example, several small molecule JAK inhibitors, such as AG490 and
Pyridone 6, directly inhibit the catalytic activity of JAKs by
competing with ATP binding (42, 44). Recently, a triterpenoid
CDDO-methyl ester (CDDO-Me) was reported to form adducts with
both JAK1 and STAT3 as well as inhibit JAK1 kinase activity (26).
CDDO-Me contains a, h-unsaturated carbonyl groups that form
reversible adducts with thiol nucleophiles. Unlike HJB, CDDO-Me
does not cross-link JAK1 into a high molecular mass form. Only one
molecule of CDDO-Me interacts with one molecule of JAK1,
therefore differentiating the mechanism by which HJB inhibits JAK
kinase activity from other JAK inhibitors. Unlike most of the
aforementioned JAK/STAT3 pathway inhibitors, which are more
specific to inhibit a specific JAK, HJB seemed to be a pan-JAK
inhibitor. Our results showed that HJB inhibited activation of STAT3
and induced death of tumor cells more potently than the JAK2specific inhibitor AG490 (Fig. 6), suggesting that a pan-JAK inhibitor
might be more likely to induce cancer cell death over specific JAK
inhibitors, and therefore would be a better anticancer agent.
In summary, our study discovered HJB, a natural diterpenoid, as
a potent inhibitor of JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. HJB suppressed both IL-6–induced and constitutive STAT3 activation by
direct inhibition of JAK kinase activity through covalent crosslinking of the JAKs. Moreover, HJB is a rather selective inhibitor of
JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. It does not affect growth factor
signaling pathways. Constitutively activated STAT3 has been
detected in a wide variety of human cancer cells (8, 45), and
accumulating evidences suggest that STAT3 signaling pathway is
an important target for therapeutic intervention in a variety of
human cancers (35, 45–48). Here, HJB exhibited strong anticancer
activity on a panel of cancer cell lines, especially those whose
survival and growth are dependent on constitutively active STAT3
signaling. These data strongly support HJB to be a novel anticancer
drug candidate. Future studies are geared toward evaluating the
antitumor activity of HJB in animal models.
