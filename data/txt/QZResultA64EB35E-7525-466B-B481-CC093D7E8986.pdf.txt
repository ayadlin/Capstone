ABSTRACT
Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains a major public health problem,
and diagnosis of metastatic disease is usually associated with poor prognosis. The
multi-kinase inhibitor regorafenib was approved in 2013 in the U.S. for the treatment
of mCRC patients who progressed after standard therapies. However, the clinical
efficacy of regorafenib is quite limited. One potential strategy to improve mCRC
therapy is to combine agents that target key cellular signaling pathways, which may
lead to synergistic enhancement of antitumor efficacy and overcome cellular drug
resistance. Protein kinase D (PKD), a family of serine/threonine kinases, mediates
key signaling pathways implicated in multiple cellular processes. Herein, we evaluated
the combination of regorafenib with a PKD inhibitor in several human CRC cells.
Using the Chou-Talalay model, the combination index values for this combination
treatment demonstrated synergistic effects on inhibition of cell proliferation and
clonal formation. This drug combination resulted in induction of apoptosis as
determined by flow cytometry, increased PARP cleavage, and decreased activation
of the anti-apoptotic protein HSP27. This combination also yielded enhanced inhibition
of ERK, AKT, and NF-κB signaling. Taken together, PKD inhibition in combination with
regorafenib appears to be a promising strategy for the treatment of mCRC.

INTRODUCTION

different levels. For example, genetic and epigenetic
changes, abnormal activation of EGFR signaling and
tumor angiogenesis mediated by VEGF contribute to the
progression of mCRC [4]. Several oncogenes have been
shown to play important roles in human CRC, such as
KRAS, BRAF, and PI3KCA. Oncogenic mutations of
KRAS and BRAF occur in approximately 35-40% and
10% of CRC, respectively [5]. Mutations in these proteins
result in the constitutive activation of the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The PI3KCA
gene encodes the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K), and an activating mutation is present
in about 20-30% of CRC [6]. PI3KCA mutations with
subsequent activation of the AKT pathway have been
implicated in the process of colorectal carcinogenesis.
In addition, activation of EGFR-mediated signaling
results in downstream activation of both MAPK and
AKT pathways [7]. Tumor angiogenesis has also been

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading
cause of cancer mortality in the U.S., and in 2014, it is
expected that about 45,000 deaths will be attributed to
this disease [1]. Approximately 25% of CRC patients will
have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and an
additional 40-50% of patients who initially present with
early-stage disease will subsequently develop metastases
over the course of their disease [2]. Once metastatic CRC
(mCRC) is diagnosed, the overall prognosis remains
poor with 5-year survival rates in the 8-10% range [3].
Understanding the signaling pathways that regulate the
metastatic phenotype will provide the scientific rationale
to develop novel agents and/or drug combinations for the
treatment of mCRC.
The biological events that drive the initiation,
promotion, and progression of CRC occur on several

identified as a critical determinant of outcome in mCRC.
Patient tumors with high vascular density are more likely
to have recurrence and metastasis [8-10]. For this reason,
the VEGF-mediated signaling pathway has served as an
attractive target for drug development, and two biologic
agents, bevacizumab and ziv-aflibercept, are presently
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for the treatment of mCRC.
Regorafenib is the first small molecule inhibitor
approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with
refractory mCRC who have progressed after standard
therapies. It is a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting BRAF,
VEGFR-1, -2, -3, KIT, TIE-2, PDGFR-β, FGFR-1, RET,
RAF-1, and p38 MAP kinase [11]. However, recent
studies have shown that RAF may be the critical target
of regorafenib in HCT116 colon cancer cells [12]. In
a pivotal randomized phase III study, a statistically
significant prolongation in overall survival (OS) was
observed in patients with mCRC who received regorafenib
therapy. The median OS was 6.4 months in the regorafenib
group compared to 5.0 months in the placebo group. These
studies also demonstrated a significant improvement in
progression-free survival (PFS). The median PFS of the
regorafenib-treated group and the placebo group was 2.0
and 1.7 months, respectively [13]. Despite the survival
benefit of regorafenib for mCRC patients, its overall
clinical efficacy remains quite limited. There is clearly an
urgent need to develop more effective approaches for the
treatment of mCRC. Rational combination chemotherapy
is considered a potentially promising strategy to enhance
antitumor activity, overcome cancer drug resistance, and
prolong disease-free and overall survival.
Protein kinase D (PKD) is a member of the serine/
threonine kinases of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent
kinase superfamily, and three main isoforms have been
identified: PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 [14]. This signaling
pathway plays a critical role in regulating several
important cellular processes, including cell proliferation,
survival, angiogenesis, DNA synthesis, adhesion, invasion/
migration, and motility [14, 15]. It functions downstream
of protein kinase C (PKC), G protein-coupled receptors,
and tyrosine kinase receptors. PKD can be activated by
both PKC-dependent and independent pathways. In turn,
activated PKD phosphorylates a variety of downstream
targets at specific sites, such as c-Jun and HDAC IIa,
thereby regulating their activity and/or subcellular
localization [16, 17]. PKD signaling has been implicated
in a wide range of human tumors, including breast,
pancreatic, prostate, and glioblastoma. Our laboratory
has recently demonstrated that PKD2-mediated signaling
pathways, including RAS/RAF/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
and NF-κB, are activated in human CRC [18]. We also
observed that PKD1 was only expressed in normal colon
cells and not in human colorectal cancer cells. In contrast,
PKD2 and PKD3 were expressed, at the protein and
mRNA levels, in both normal and transformed colon cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lines. Given the documented importance of PKD in tumor
biology, several PKD inhibitors have been developed,
including CRT0066101, CID755673, and kb-NB142-70
[19, 26]. CRT0066101 is a small molecule PKD-specific
inhibitor with significant in vitro and in vivo antitumor
activity in human CRC. This molecule inhibited PKD2
activation, blocked NF-κB mediated cellular proliferation
and survival, and induced apoptosis [18]. Given the
promising therapeutic effect of PKD inhibitors, it is
conceivable that the combination of regorafenib with
a PKD inhibitor may result in synergistic inhibition of
cellular signaling pathways in mCRC. With this in mind,
we evaluated the combination of regorafenib and PKD
inhibitors using a series of human CRC cell lines, and
investigated the downstream signaling effects mediated
by this combination were investigated.

RESULTS
Effect of the combination of regorafenib and
CRT0066101 on CRC cell growth
We evaluated the effect of regorafenib in
combination with the pan-PKD inhibitor CRT0066101
on the growth of various human CRC cell lines (HCT116
p53+/+, HCT116 p53-/-, RKO, HT-29, SW48 and SW48TP53 [R273H]). As outlined in Table 1, each of these
cell lines expressed different gene mutation profiles in
the respective KRAS, BRAF, PI3KCA, and TP53 genes.
The regorafenib concentration that inhibited 50% of cell
proliferation (IC50) in these cell lines ranged from 3-6 μM
(Table 2). Of note, regorafenib effectively inhibited the
growth of TP53 knockout cells (HCT116 p53-/-), which
has been generally viewed as a CRC cell line resistant to
chemotherapy, suggesting that this agent exerts its growth
inhibitory effects on CRC growth in a p53-independent
manner. Cells with a mutant p53 (HT29) displayed a
2-fold higher IC50 value (p<0.05) suggesting that the
absence of p53 may be functionally different than having
mutant p53 as reported previously [20]. To determine
whether the activating p53 mutation (R273H) was the
cause of regorafenib resistance, we evaluated the effect
of regorafenib on the growth of SW48-TP53(R273H)
and its corresponding parental cells. As seen in Table
2, the IC50 values of regorafenib in these cell lines were
similar suggesting that the p53 activating mutation was
not a determinant of regorafenib sensitivity. CRT0066101
was selected for study as previous work had shown that it
led to a dose-dependent increase in expression of cleaved
PARP and activated caspase-3, in addition to inhibition
of AKT and ERK signaling and suppression of NF-κB
activity [18]. Moreover, this compound displayed potent
growth inhibitory effects against this same panel of human
CRC cell lines.

To determine whether simultaneous inhibition
of multiple kinases might result in synergistic effects,
the combination index (CI) values were calculated
according to the Chou-Talalay median effects analysis
for drug interactions. Human CRC cells were incubated
with various concentrations of regorafenib and PKD
inhibitor and at consistent drug ratios for 72 hours. Cell
proliferation was determined by WST-1 assay, and the CI
values were subsequently calculated for drug interactions
using the Calcusyn software [21]. A CI of less than 1.0
was considered to be indicative of synergism, and this
interaction was further classified as strong synergism
(CI < 0.3), synergism (CI of 0.3-0.7), and slight to
moderate synergism (CI of 0.7-0.9). As seen in Fig.
1A, the combination of regorafenib with CRT0066101
exhibited significant synergistic inhibitory effects on
the growth of HCT116 cells. The CI value was <1 for
concentrations below the respective IC50 values for each
drug (Fig. 1B). As the drug concentrations reached their
IC50 values, the effect on cell growth was additive with
a CI ~1. To validate that the synergistic effect was due
to PKD2 inhibition, we performed growth experiments
combining PKD2 siRNA and regorafenib in HCT116
cells. As shown in Fig. 1K, knockdown of PKD2 with
a specific siRNA resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity
when combined with regorafenib. In contrast, a control
siRNA was unable to enhance sensitivity to regorafenib
(data not shown). The combination of CRT0066101 and
regorafenib demonstrated similar synergistic effects in a
number of additional cell lines (HCT116 p53-/-, Fig. 1C;
RKO, Fig. 1E; HT-29, Fig. 1G). We also evaluated the
effects of this combination on the growth of normal colon
epithelial CCD 841 CoN cells. In contrast to human CRC
cells, the combination treatment did not exhibit synergy
in normal colon epithelial cells (Fig. 1I) despite the fact
that the individual drug IC50 values were similar (Table 2).
This finding suggests that the combination of regorafenib
and CRT0066101 may preferentially affect CRC cells and
spare normal cells from increased toxicity.
In addition to investigating the effect of the drug
combination on cell growth, we determined the potential
effect of this combination on clonogenic growth. For these
studies, we used HCT116 and RKO cells, and both cell
lines were treated with various concentrations of both
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitors for 24 hours. After an additional 14 days, cell
clones were fixed, stained, and counted. As seen in Fig. 2,
the combination of regorafenib and CRT0066101 resulted
in significant inhibition of clonogenic growth in both the
HCT116 and RKO cell lines.

Effect of the combination of regorafenib and
CRT0066101 on apoptosis
Given the synergistic growth inhibitory effect
of regorafenib and CRT0066101, we next investigated
the potential molecular mechanisms underlying this
synergism. To determine the impact of the combination on
induction of apoptosis, cells were treated with regorafenib
and/or CRT0066101 for 24 hours, stained with FITCAnnexin V and PI, and then analyzed by flow cytometry.
As seen in Fig. 3A, treatment with regorafenib or
CRT0066101, alone, at their respective IC50 concentration,
resulted in only minimal induction of apoptosis in RKO
cells. However, when the two agents were combined,
a significant increase in the number of both early and
late apoptotic cells was observed. To explore additional
markers of apoptosis, we determined the expression
of cleaved PARP and pS82-HSP27. While treatment
with regorafenib (3 μM) or CRT0066101 (1 μM), by
themselves, had minimal effect on induction of cleaved
PARP expression, the combination significantly increased
PARP cleavage in RKO cells (Figs. 3B, 3D). In addition,
we observed an enhanced reduction in expression of
phosphorylated HSP27 with the drug combination. HSP27
has been shown to have strong anti-apoptotic properties
through stabilization of the protein translation factor eIF4E
in resistant prostate cancer cells [22]. Furthermore, HSP27
is a known substrate of protein kinase D, and abnormal
activation of HSP27 may contribute to resistance to
apoptosis in human CRC cells [23]. As seen in Figs. 3C
and 3E, the combination of regorafenib and CRT0066101
resulted in significant dose-dependent suppression of
HSP27 phosphorylation. Similar effects of this drug
combination on induction of apoptosis were also observed
in HCT116 cells (data not shown).
To further explore the underlying mechanisms

mediating the induction of apoptosis, we determined the
effect of this drug combination on expression of p53upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). PUMA
is a member of the Bcl-2 family and has been shown
to be an important regulator of apoptosis in CRC.
Recent studies have demonstrated that regorafenib
induces PUMA expression in a time- and concentrationdependent manner [12] but it is not yet known whether
PKD inhibition directly activates this pathway. As seen in
Fig. 3F, CRT0066101 treatment had no effect on PUMA
expression while regorafenib induced its expression as
expected. Interestingly, the combination of regorafenib
and PKD inhibition resulted in suppression of PUMA
induction. Thus, our results suggest that the combination
of regorafenib with CRT006601 significantly induced
apoptosis in human CRC.

pathways has been shown to activate cell proliferation and
the development of cellular drug resistance [5, 24]. Our
earlier studies had shown that PKD2 plays an important
role in mediating growth and survival signaling pathways
in CRC [18]. Similarly, the multi-kinase inhibitor
regorafenib is able to simultaneously suppress RAS/RAF/
ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways [25]. With this
in mind, we investigated the potential effect of the drug
combination on activation of these key signaling pathways.
After exposure to regorafenib and/or CRT0066101 for 24
hours, p-PKD2, p-ERK, p-AKT and total PKD2, ERK and
AKT expression was determined by Western blot analysis.
As anticipated, CRT0066101 effectively blocked the
activation of PKD2 (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 6). Treatment of
regorafenib alone demonstrated no suppressive effect on
PKD2 activity, and in fact, appeared to result in increased
PKD2 activation. To investigate this further, HCT116 cells
were treated with the drug combination without PMA
stimulation. As seen in Fig. 4B, treatment with regorafenib
alone resulted in induction of p-PKD2 expression. The
combination of the two agents prevented this induction.
As p-PKD2 was undetectable in non-stimulated RKO
cells, no induction was observed in these cells (data not
shown). With respect to the downstream pathways, we
observed that regorafenib or CRT0066101, each by itself,

did not affect expression of p-AKT. However, the two
drugs in combination caused a significant reduction in
p-AKT expression without altering total AKT levels (Fig.
4A, lanes 5 and 8). In addition, treatment with 1 μM of
CRT0066101 had little effect on p-ERK expression (Fig.
4A, lane 3). However, the combination of CRT0066101
(1 μM) and regorafenib (3 μM) yielded a significantly
reduced expression of p-ERK (Fig. 4A, lane 5) while the
expression of total ERK was not altered. The higher dose
combination resulted in a greater reduction in expression
of p-ERK in RKO cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 8). Similar
effects of this drug combination were also observed in
HCT116 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that

PKD2 inhibition of may lead to an enhanced inhibitory
effect of regorafenib on both ERK and AKT signaling.

Effect of regorafenib and CRT0066101 on NF-ΚB
activity
Previous studies from our lab and others have shown
that CRT0066101 treatment has a suppressive effect on
activation of NF-κB [18, 26]. As regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor, it is conceivable that it may also impact
on NF-κB signaling. For this reason, the combination of
regorafenib and CRT0066101 may result in a synergistic
inhibitory effect on NF-κB activation. To investigate

the effect of the drug combination on NF-κB activity,
HCT116 and RKO cells were each transiently transfected
with a luciferase plasmid under the control of the NF-κB
response element. After incubation of regorafenib and/
or CRT0066101 for 2 hours, cells were stimulated by
TNF-α (50 ng/mL) for an additional 5 hours, and NFκB activity was determined by the dual luciferase assay.
As seen in Fig. 5A, both regorafenib or CRT0066101,
as single agents, inhibited NF-κB activation, while the
combination of regorafenib and CRT0066101 significantly
enhanced the inhibitory effect of NF-κB activity in a dosedependent manner. In addition to TNF-α stimulation, we
stimulated NF-κB activity with PMA, a known PKD
pathway activator. While each drug alone had minimal
effect, the combination of the two molecules significantly
inhibited PMA-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 5B). We also
determined the effect of this combination on basal levels
of NF-κB activity. The effect of combined regorafenib and
CRT0066101 enhanced the suppression of basal NF-κB
activity (Fig. 5C), which is a finding consistent with the
TNF-α- and PMA-induced results. Taken together, the
combination of regorafenib with CRT0066101 resulted in
a synergistic suppression of activation of NF-κB pathway.

in a significant synergistic cytotoxic effect in CRC cells
that expressed different genetic mutation profiles.
Various DNA mutation profiles in genes such as
KRAS, BRAF, PI3KCA, and TP53 have been associated
with the efficacy of targeted therapy, cellular drug
resistance, and poor overall prognosis. KRAS, BRAF, or
PIK3CA mutation results in a continuous activation of
the downstream RAS/RAF/ERK or PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathways, regardless of whether the EGFR is activated or
blocked [5]. Such activation in turn enhances transcription
of various oncogenes, including MYC, CREB, and NF-κB
[32]. The presence of KRAS mutations, which occur in 3540% of CRC patients, has emerged as a key determinant
of resistance to targeted EGFR treatment. TP53, one of
the most frequently mutated genes in CRC, is a critical
regulator gene controlling several important cellular
processes, such as cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair,
and genomic integrity [33]. Clinical investigators have

DISCUSSION
The direct targeting of multiple cell signaling
pathways such as EGFR and VEGF has proven to be a
promising strategy to treat patients with mCRC [27, 28].
However, only a subgroup of patients with this disease
who are wild-type RAS and BRAF will be responsive
to anti-EGFR therapy. Similarly, the clinical benefit of
targeted VEGF approaches in prolonging overall survival
of mCRC patient is limited, and a fraction of patients are
intrinsically refractory or acquire resistance [28-30]. As a
result, there is a significant unmet medical need for the
development of effective therapies that can stabilize and/
or slow the progression of mCRC. Thus, the development
of novel drug combination regimens is considered a
potentially effective strategy to enhance antitumor
activity, overcome cellular drug resistance, and prolong
PFS and OS [31]. With this in mind, we used the ChouTalalay median effects analysis to demonstrate that the
combination of regorafenib with a PKD inhibitor resulted

demonstrated that there is an association between somatic
mutations in TP53 or abnormal protein expression with
poor survival or lack of response to therapy [34].
In the present study, we evaluated the combined
effect of multi-kinase inhibitor regorafenib and panPKD inhibitor CRT0066101 against 4 human CRC cells
(including HCT116, HCT116 p53-/-, RKO and, HT-29),
with each cell line having different mutation profiles in
KRAS, BRAF, PI3KCA, and TP53 genes. Our data show
that the combination of regorafenib with CRT0066101
displayed synergistic effects in CRC cells that expressed
mutations in these important genes. Interestingly, this
combination was not synergistic in normal colon epithelial
cells, which suggests that this combination might
exhibit an improved selective advantage in tumor cells
over normal, thereby resulting in a potential improved
therapeutic window. We further demonstrated that this
drug combination activated the apoptotic pathways,
perhaps mediated through a PUMA-independent manner
as PUMA induction normally observed with regorafenib
treatment was suppressed in the presence of both drugs.
As regorafenib inhibits multiple kinases and PKD
regulation can alter cellular survival signaling cascades,
we determined the effect of drug combination on these
critical pathways. Our results show that regorafenib
combined with CRT0066101 synergistically suppressed
RAS/RAF/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in
CRC (Fig. 4). Activation of NF-κB signaling is often
observed in CRC, and this pathway plays a critical role in
facilitating oncogenesis and metastasis and in mediating
resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy [24].
PKD is a key mediator of NF-κB activation in pancreatic
cancer and human CRC. In pancreatic cancer, the PKD
inhibitor CRT0066101 significantly suppressed NF-κB
activity and the expression of NF-κB–dependent gene
products essential for cell proliferation and survival
[26]. Similarly, our previous studies showed that
structurally distinct PKD inhibitors (CRT0066101 and
kb-NB-142-70) all substantially suppressed the activation
of NF-κB in human CRC [18]. In the current study,
we showed that the combination of regorafenib with
CRT0066101 synergistically suppressed the activation
of NF-κB pathway in both stimulated CRC cells and
under basal conditions (Fig. 5). This observation may
explain the lack of PUMA induction seen with this drug
combination as PUMA expression is regulated by NFκB [12]. Taken together, this combination effectively
blocked cancer cellular survival signaling cascades. Of
note, regorafenib, as a single agent, was able to induce the
phosphorylation of PKD2. This activation may represent
a cellular resistance pathway by which the cells maintain
growth and proliferation in the presence of exposure to
the multi-kinase inhibitor. However, when combined
with the PKD inhibitor, this activation was effectively
suppressed providing additional evidence supporting this
drug combination.

In conclusion, we have shown that targeted
inhibition of PKD is able to significantly enhance the
cytotoxic effect of regorafenib in a series of human CRC
cell lines. The mechanisms underlying this positive drugdrug interaction may be associated with synergistically
induced apoptosis and inhibition of key survival signaling
cascades, including RAS/RAF/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR
and NF-κB pathways (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that
the combination of regorafenib and a PKD inhibitor may
represent a novel strategy for the treatment of mCRC.

serum at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
HCT116 and RKO cells were profiled at the University of
Pittsburgh Cell Culture and Cytogenetics Facility (August
2013 authenticated by STR). Cells were tested monthly
for mycoplasma by the MycoAlert Mycoplasma detection
assay (Cambrex BioScience).

Cell Signaling), anti-PUMA (#12450; Cell Signaling)
and anti-α-tubulin (EMD Biosciences; San Diego, CA).
After multiple TBST washes (1×TBS, 0.1%Tween-20),
membranes were incubated with corresponding
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Bio-Rad) for 1 hour at room temperature. Proteins were
detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method
(SuperSignal West Pico substrate; Pierce; Rockford,
IL). Quantitation of signal intensities was performed by
densitometry on a Xerox scanner using ImageJ software.

Cell proliferation and clonogenic assays
Human CRC cells were seeded in 96-well plates at
1500-2000 cells/well. On the following day, cells were
treated with various concentrations of regorafenib and/
or CRT0066101 for 72 hours. For siRNA/regorafenib
combination experiments, siRNAs were transfected
using Lipofectamine 2000 at various concentrations.
After 24 hours, the medium was replaced and regorafenib
was added for an additional 72 hours. Cell viability was
determined by the WST-1 assay (Roche; Indianapolis,
IN). The IC50 value was defined as the drug concentration
that inhibits 50% cell growth compared with untreated
controls and calculated by Graphpad Prism 6.0 software.
To determine the potential mechanism of drug-drug
interactions, we used CalcuSyn software (version 2.0,
Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) to calculate the combination
index (CI) according to published methods. A CI of less
than 1.0 was considered to be indicative of synergism, and
this interaction was further classified as strong synergism
(CI < 0.3), synergism (CI of 0.3-0.7), and slight to
moderate synergism (CI of 0.7-0.9).
For clonogenic assays, HCT116 and RKO cells
were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 400 cells/well.
On the following day, cells were treated with various
concentrations of regorafenib and/or CRT0066101 for
24 hours, after which time, the growth medium was
replaced. After 10-14 days, clones were fixed with trypan
blue solution (75% methanol/25% acetic acid/0.25%
trypan blue) for 15 minutes, washed, and air-dried before
counting clones >50 cells.

Apoptosis assay
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of
4×105 cells/well. After exposure to different concentrations
of regorafenib and/or CRT0066101 for 24 hours, cells
were harvested, washed twice with PBS, resuspended
with 1x binding buffer (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA),
stained with FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit
(BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA), and analyzed on the BD
Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer (BD Accuri Cytometers Inc.;
Ann Arbor, MI) at the UPCI Flow Cytometry Facility.

NF-κB activity assay
Cells (1×105) were plated in 24-well plates 16 hours
before transfection. A total of 0.5 μg of pGL3-Luc-NFκB DNA was then co-transfected with 0.1 μg of Renilla
luciferase vector DNA (internal control, Promega)
into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the
manufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen). After 6 hours, the
growth medium was changed. On the following day, cells
were treated with various concentrations of regorafenib
and/or CRT0066101 for 2 hours, followed by stimulation
with TNF-α (50 ng/mL) or PMA (100 nM) for an
additional 5 hours. Luminescence values were normalized
with renilla activity, and the reporter assays were
performed in triplicate. For measurement of basal NF-κB
activity, RKO cells stably expressing the pGL3-Luc-NFκB construct were used [17]. Luminescence values were
normalized to total soluble protein as measured by the
Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific, Inc.).

Western blot analysis
Protein concentration of cell lysates was determined
by the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA). Equal
amounts of protein (30 µg) from each cell lysate were
resolved on SDS-PAGE using the method of Laemmli and
transferred onto 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad). Membranes were blocked and incubated overnight
with primary antibodies at 4°C. The following antibodies
were used in the experiments: anti-pTyr204-ERK (#sc7383; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ERK (#sc-94;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-pSer473-AKT (#9542;
Cell Signaling), anti-AKT (#9272; Cell Signaling), antipSer867-PKD2 (#07-385; Upstate), anti-PKD2 (#07-488,
Upstate), anti-PARP (#9542; Cell Signaling), anti-p-Ser82HSP27 (#9709; Cell Signaling), anti-HSP27 (#2402;
