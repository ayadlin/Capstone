Abstract
There is a preclinical evidence that the oral administration of D,L-sulforaphane (SFN) can decrease the
incidence or burden of early-stage prostate cancer [prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)] and well-differentiated cancer (WDC) but not late-stage poorly differentiated cancer (PDC). Because SFN treatment induces
cytoprotective autophagy in cultured human prostate cancer cells, the present study tested the hypothesis that
chemopreventive efﬁcacy of SFN could be augmented by the pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy using
chloroquine (CQ). Incidence of PDC characterized by prostate weight of more than 1 g was signiﬁcantly lower in
the SFN þ CQ group than in control (P ¼ 0.004), CQ group (P ¼ 0.026), or SFN group (P ¼ 0.002 by Fisher exact
test). Average size of the metastatic lymph node was lower by about 42% in the SFN þ CQ group than in control (P
¼ 0.043 by Wilcoxon test). On the other hand, the SFN þ CQ combination was not superior to SFN alone with
respect to inhibition of incidence or burden of microscopic PIN or WDC. SFN treatment caused in vivo autophagy
as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy. Mechanistic studies showed that prevention of prostate
cancer and metastasis by the SFN þ CQ combination was associated with decreased cell proliferation, increased
apoptosis, alterations in protein levels of autophagy regulators Atg5 and phospho-mTOR, and suppression of
biochemical features of epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Plasma proteomics identiﬁed protein expression
signature that may serve as biomarker of SFN þ CQ exposure/response. This study offers a novel combination
regimen for future clinical investigations for prevention of prostate cancer in humans. Cancer Res; 73(19); 5985–95.

Introduction
Cruciferous vegetable intake in the diet is inversely associated with the risk of different malignancies including cancer
of the prostate (1, 2), which is a leading cause of cancer-related
deaths among men in the United States (3). Phytochemicals
capable of eliciting cancer protective effect have now been
isolated from different edible cruciferous vegetables including broccoli, watercress, and garden cress (4, 5). Sulforaphane
[1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulﬁnyl)-butane] is one such
small molecule of interest for prevention of cancers (5). Sulforaphane (SFN) occurs naturally as an L-isomer, but its synthetic
D,L-analogue has been studied extensively for cancer prevention properties (5–10). Naturally occurring or synthetic SFN

has exhibited cancer chemopreventive effects in chemically
induced as well as oncogene-driven rodent cancer models
(6–10). Talalay and colleagues were the ﬁrst to report SFNmediated inhibition of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene–
induced mammary cancer development in rats (6). Chemopreventive efﬁcacy of SFN was subsequently established in
other chemically induced rodent cancer models, including
tobacco carcinogen–induced lung cancer (7), benzo[a]pyreneinduced stomach cancer (8), and azoxymethane-induced
colonic aberrant crypt foci (9). Previous work from our own
laboratory has revealed that oral administration of 6 mmol
SFN 3 times per week results in signiﬁcant inhibition of earlystage prostate carcinogenesis in transgenic adenocarcinoma
of mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice without any side effects
(10). Speciﬁcally, the incidence of prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (PIN) and well-differentiated prostate cancer
(WDC) was about 23% to 28% lower in the prostate of
SFN-treated TRAMP mice than in controls (10). However, the
incidence of poorly differentiated prostate cancer (PDC) was
not affected by the SFN regimen used in our study (10). In
another study, feeding of TRAMP mice with 240 mg of broccoli
sprout/day resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in prostate
tumor growth (11). We were the ﬁrst to show in vivo efﬁcacy
of SFN against PC-3 human prostate cancer xenografts in
male athymic mice (12).
Insight into the mechanisms by which SFN likely prevents
cancer development continues to expand, albeit mostly from

cellular studies. Nevertheless, the mechanisms potentially
contributing to SFN-mediated chemoprevention include
cell-cycle arrest (13), apoptosis induction (14, 15), inhibition
of angiogenesis and histone deacetylase (16, 17), and suppression of oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g., NF-kB, STAT3,
and androgen receptor; refs. 18–20). SFN is not a targeted
agent as is the case for many other dietary cancer chemopreventive agents (21).
Previously, we made an exciting observation that exposure
of cultured human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP and PC-3) to
SFN resulted in induction of autophagy (22), which is an
evolutionary conserved physiologic process for bulk degradation of macromolecules including organelles and considered a valid cancer therapeutic target (23, 24). We also found
that autophagy was a protective mechanism against apoptosis induction by SFN (22). However, the in vivo signiﬁcance of
these observations was unclear. The present study addresses
this gap in our knowledge using autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and the TRAMP mouse model of prostate
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies
SFN was synthesized as described previously (7). The purity
of SFN was 98% as determined by high-performance liquid
chromatography. Stock solution of SFN was stored at 20 C.
SFN was diluted with PBS immediately before use. CQ was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies against T-antigen,
synaptophysin, and E-cadherin were from BD Biosciences;
antibodies against microtubule-associated protein 1 light
chain 3 (LC3), androgen receptor (AR), and vimentin were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-Ki-67 antibody
was purchased from Dako-Agilent Technologies; and antibodies against p62, cleaved caspase-3, Atg5, and phospho(S2448)-mTOR were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was conducted using
ApopTag Plus Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit
(EMD Millipore). A kit for quantitation of VEGF in tumor
lysates was purchased from R&D Systems.
Randomization and treatment of mice
Use of mice and their care were in accordance with the
University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee guidelines. Male TRAMP [(C57BL/6xFVB)
F1] mice were obtained by crossing TRAMP female in the
C57BL/6 background with male FVB mice. Transgene veriﬁcation was conducted as described by Greenberg and
colleagues (25). After transgene veriﬁcation, 4-week-old
male TRAMP mice were placed on AIN-93G diet (Harlan
Teklad) for 1 week before the onset of treatments, and the
mice were maintained on this diet throughout the experiment. Initially, as the mice became available from our
breeding program, a total of 128 mice were placed into one
of the following groups: control (n ¼ 32), CQ alone (n ¼ 32),
SFN alone (n ¼ 35), and SFN þ CQ combination (n ¼ 29). As
summarized in Supplementary Table S1, some mice from

5986

Cancer Res; 73(19) October 1, 2013

each group were removed from the study due to a variety of
reasons, including weight loss, hind limb paralysis, seminal
vesicle invasion, and tumors at sites other than prostate.
Final number of mice available for evaluations was: control
(n ¼ 28), CQ alone (n ¼ 25), SFN alone (n ¼ 28), and SFN þ
CQ (n ¼ 25). Majority of the evaluable mice in each group
were treated for 18 weeks but a fraction of mice from control
(25%), CQ alone (16%), SFN alone (21%), and SFN þ CQ
combination group (8%) were sacriﬁced after 15 to 17 weeks
of treatment due to large tumor burden. Nevertheless, these
mice were included in the analysis. The mice of the control
group received 0.1 mL PBS by oral intubation as well as
intraperitoneal injection 3 times per week. The CQ alone
group of mice were treated with 1.2 mg CQ (in 0.1 mL PBS)
by intraperitoneal injection and 0.1 mL PBS by oral intubation 3 times per week. The SFN group of mice received 1 mg
SFN (in 0.1 mL PBS) by oral intubation and 0.1 mL PBS by
intraperitoneal injection 3 times per week. The SFN þ CQ
group of mice received 1 mg SFN (in 0.1 mL PBS) by oral
intubation and 1.2 mg CQ (in 0.1 mL PBS) by intraperitoneal
injection 3 times per week. Treatments were given
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week. Body
weights of the mice were recorded once weekly beginning
at 5 weeks of age. The animals were sacriﬁced by CO2
inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected for separation of plasma, which was stored at 20 C.
The prostate tissues were harvested, weighed, ﬁxed in
10% neutral-buffered formalin, and sectioned at 4 to 5 mm
thickness.
Histopathologic evaluations
Wholemount hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections of prostate tissues were digitized by scanning and each
section was blindly scored for microscopic PIN and WDC
incidence and burden (affected area). The area of the lesions
(in 2 dimensions) was calculated on histologic slides using
on-screen drawing tool of the WebScope viewing software
from Aperio. The mean PIN and WDC area were calculated
from sum of the area in an animal and the average of area
over all the animals for each group. Pathologic grading was
consistent with the criteria deﬁned in our previous studies
(10, 26).
Immunohistochemistry
Brieﬂy, prostate sections were quenched with 3% hydrogen
peroxide and blocked with normal serum. The sections were
then probed with the desired primary antibody (anti-synaptophysin, anti-T-antigen, anti-Ki-67, anti-LC3, anti-AR),
washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with secondary antibody. Characteristic brown color was developed
by incubation with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine. The sections were
counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma) and examined under a Leica microscope. The images were analyzed
with the use of ImageScope software (Aperio). Synaptophysin
expression was analyzed using the membrane algorithm,
LC3 expression was analyzed using the positive pixel algorithm, and nuclear algorithm was used to quantify Ki-67,
T-antigen, and AR-positive cells.

Chemoprevention of Prostate Cancer by D,L-Sulforaphane

Transmission electron microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy using prostate tissue
was conducted for visualization and quantitation of autophagic vacuoles. Transmission electron microscopy was conducted essentially as described by us previously (26). Brieﬂy,
prostate tissues were immersion ﬁxed in 2.5% electron
microscopy grade glutaraldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 C,
washed in PBS, and then post-ﬁxed in 1% aqueous osmium
tetroxide containing 0.1% potassium ferricyanide for 1 hour.
Following 3 PBS washes, samples were dehydrated through
a graded series of 30% to 100% ethanol. Propylene oxide
(100%) was then inﬁltrated in a 1:1 mixture of propylene
oxide and Poly/Bed 812 epoxy resin (Epon; Polysciences) for
1 hour. After several changes of 100% resin over 24 hours,
samples were embedded in molds, cured at 37 C overnight,
followed by additional hardening at 65 C for 2 days. Ultrathin (60 nm) sections were collected on 200 mesh copper
grids, stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 50% methanol for 10
minutes, and then stained in 1% lead citrate for 7 minutes.
Sections were imaged using JEOL 1011 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV ﬁtted with a side-mount digital
camera.
TUNEL assay
Prostate sections were deparafﬁnized, rehydrated, and
then used to visualize apoptotic bodies by TUNEL staining.
TUNEL staining was conducted according to the supplier's
instructions. Four to ﬁve randomly selected, nonoverlapping, and nonnecrotic ﬁelds were imaged to score TUNELpositive cells.
Western blotting
Tumor samples from each group were processed for Western blotting as previously described (10). Western blotting was
done as described previously (26).
Determination of VEGF levels
The levels of VEGF in tumor lysates from different groups
were measured using a commercially available kit according to
the supplier's instructions. The results were normalized to
protein concentration.
Plasma proteomics by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis
and mass spectrometry
Plasma proteomics was conducted by Applied Biomics.
Randomly selected plasma samples (without complete
knowledge of the histopathologic data) from control mice
(n ¼ 3), SFN alone–treated mice (n ¼ 3), and mice treated
with the SFN þ CQ combination (n ¼ 4) were used for
plasma proteomics analyses essentially as described by us
previously (26). Results are expressed as a ratio of abundance of a desired protein in the SFN or SFN þ CQ group to
the control group. Cluster analysis for protein abundance
changes was conducted using a public bioinformatics tool
[The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated
Discovery (DAVID), http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp;
ref. 27]. The software uses a novel algorithm to measure
the relationships among the annotation terms based on the

www.aacrjournals.org

degrees of their co-association genes to group the similar,
redundant, and heterogeneous annotation contents from the
same or different resources into annotation groups.
Statistical analysis
The association of incidence and treatment was examined
by Fisher exact test. Comparisons of lymph node metastasis
or prostate size between the 4 treatment groups were
conducted using Wilcoxon 2-sample test. Area of PIN and
WDC was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
multiple comparison adjustment. Statistical signiﬁcance of
differences in mechanistic correlates (immunohistochemical analyses, TUNEL-positive apoptotic bodies, and number
of autophagic vacuoles) was determined using one-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni adjustment. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 or GraphPad
Prism version 4.03. Difference was considered signiﬁcant at
P < 0.05.

Results
Effects of SFN and/or CQ treatments on PDC
We have shown previously that SFN treatment induces
cytoprotective autophagy in cultured human prostate cancer
cells (PC-3 and LNCaP) regardless of the AR or p53 status (22).
The main objective of the present study was to determine
the in vivo signiﬁcance of these observations. We hypothesized that the chemopreventive efﬁcacy of SFN against
prostate cancer might be augmented by pharmacologic
inhibition of autophagy using CQ, which disrupts lysosome
acidiﬁcation (28). As shown in Fig. 1A, the initial and ﬁnal
body weights of the mice were not affected by treatments
with SFN and/or CQ when compared with control. Wet
weight of the prostate is an indicator of tumor burden in
the TRAMP model. The mean prostate weight of the mice
treated with SFN þ CQ (1.43 g) was lower by about 45%
compared with control group (P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 1B). The mean
prostate weight of the mice of SFN þ CQ group was also
lower than SFN alone (2.74 g) or CQ alone group (2.47 g), but
the difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 1B).
Microscopic examinations of the wholemount H&E-stained
sections from the prostate of mice revealed that PDC was the
predominant pathology if the mean prostate weight was
more than 1 g. We therefore computed percentage of mice
with prostate weight of more than 1 g. As shown in Fig. 1C,
the percentage of mice with prostate weight more than 1 g
was signiﬁcantly lower in the SFN þ CQ group (12%) than in
control (50%), CQ alone (44%), and SFN alone group
(54%; Fig. 1C). Collectively, these results indicated inhibition
of PDC upon co-treatment with SFN and CQ, which was not
observed with SFN alone administration.

metastasis
Figure 2A depicts metastatic lymph node in a representative mouse each of the control group and the SFN þ CQ
treatment group. Lymph node metastasis incidence in the
SFN þ CQ–treated mice was lower (12%) than that of the

group (36%; Fig. 2B). The size of the metastatic lymph node
in the mice of SFN þ CQ group was signiﬁcantly lower (42%
lower) than in the control group (Fig. 2C). These results
indicated that treatment with SFN þ CQ combination was
associated with inhibition of lymph node metastasis, which
was not observed by treatment with SFN alone.

hand, consistent with our previous observations (10), SFN
treatment alone was able to signiﬁcantly reduce area (79%

with control (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the area of the WDC in
mice treated with SFN þ CQ combination was about 69%
lower than that of control mice (P < 0.01; Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results indicated that the effect of SFN þ CQ
combination was not superior to SFN alone with respect to
the effect on PIN or WDC incidence and burden.

SFN treatment caused in vivo autophagy
Transmission electron microscopy was conducted for visualization and quantitation of autophagic vacuoles in the prostate of control mice and those treated with SFN and/or CQ
(Fig. 4B). CQ impairs autophagic protein degradation by
increasing intralysosomal pH (28, 30, 31). CQ treatment leads
to accumulation of ineffective autophagosomes, which was
also observed in the present study (Fig. 4B). It is important to
point out that distinction between effective and ineffective
autophagosomes is not possible by electron microscopy. Nevertheless, the number of autophagic vacuoles was signiﬁcantly

higher in the prostate of SFN-treated mice compared with
control (Fig. 4B). Autophagy induction by SFN administration
in vivo was conﬁrmed by immunohistochemical analysis of
LC3, which is a critical protein in autophagic machinery (32).
Expression of LC3 was relatively higher in the prostate of mice
treated with SFN alone and SFN þ CQ compared with control
but the difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (Fig.

for SFN-induced autophagy.
Analysis of Ki-67 and AR expression and TUNEL-positive
apoptotic bodies
We raised the question of whether SFN-mediated prevention of prostate cancer in TRAMP model was partly due to
suppression of the transgene. Expression of T-antigen was
not affected by SFN and/or CQ treatments (Fig. 5A). While
the expression of Ki-67 (a marker of cell proliferation)
was signiﬁcantly lower in the tumors of SFN alone and
SFN þ CQ group than in control or CQ alone group (Fig.

less in the prostate of control mice or those treated with CQ
(Fig. 5D). The number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic bodies
was increased upon treatment with SFN compared with CQ.
The SFN þ CQ combination was even more effective in
increasing the number of TUNEL-positive cells but the
difference was insigniﬁcant due to large variability.
We proceeded to determine the expression of p62, which is
another marker of autophagy, and caspase-3 cleavage, which is
an indicator of apoptosis, using tumor supernatants from 3 to 4
mice of each group. Two of 4 samples showed decreased
intensity for p62 expression in the SFN þ CQ group when
compared with control (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cleavage of
caspase-3 was very low in tumors of control and CQ alone
groups as expected but was increased in SFN alone and SFN þ

Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), biochemically
characterized by loss of adherens junction protein E-cadherin
concomitant with induction of vimentin, is implicated as a
signiﬁcant contributor to cancer progression as well as metastatic spread (33, 34). The expression of E-cadherin protein
was either undetectable or very low in the tumors of control,
CQ alone, and SFN alone treatment groups. On the other hand,
the expression of E-cadherin was clearly visible in some tumors
of mice from the SFN þ CQ treatment group (Fig. 6A). Because
of large variability in E-cadherin expression and less than

sufﬁcient power because of a profound effect of the SFN þ CQ
combination on prostate cancer development, statistical analysis was not possible (Fig. 6B). Nevertheless consistent with the
E-cadherin protein expression data, the level of vimentin
protein was lower in the tumors of SFN þ CQ group in
comparison with other groups (Fig. 6A). Thus, potential inhibition of EMT in the tumor by the SFN þ CQ combination
treatment likely contributes to its anti-metastatic effect. Likewise, there was a trend of an increase in protein levels of
autophagy regulator Atg5 in the tumors of SFN þ CQ–treated
mice compared with control or SFN treatment groups (Fig. 6A
and B). mTOR is another protein implicated in regulation of
autophagy (35). Protein level of phospho-mTOR (active form)
was relatively lower in the tumors of SFN þ CQ–treated mice
than in the tumors of control mice. Finally, SFN þ CQ com-

Discussion
Our initial observations of autophagy induction by SFN
treatment in cultured prostate cancer cells (22, 37) have since
been conﬁrmed by other investigators in different types of
cancer cells (38–41). Majority of these studies support our
conclusions that autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism
(38–40). For example, pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy
using 3-methyl adenine or baﬁlomycin A1 augments SFN-

these ﬁndings was unclear. The present study is the ﬁrst
published report to show that (i) SFN administration causes
in vivo autophagy as evidenced by transmission electron

alone. These observations merit investigation of the SFN þ CQ
combination for prevention of prostate cancer in a clinical
setting.

the present study, the overall incidence of lung metastasis in
control mice was surprisingly lower (<10%) than observed
by us previously (>75%) in TRAMP model (10, 42). On the
other hand, the overall incidence of lymph node metastasis
observed in control mice in the present study was comparable to those reported previously (10, 42). The present study
reveals that the incidence as well as size of lymph node
metastasis is signiﬁcantly reduced upon treatment with SFN
þ CQ combination when compared with control group. The
mechanism by which SFN þ CQ combination suppresses
metastasis likely involves inhibition of EMT and suppression
of proangiogenic cytokine VEGF. We have shown previously
that SFN treatment alone is unable to restore E-cadherin
expression (10). Nevertheless, further studies are needed to
validate these conclusions with larger sample size, which
was not possible in the present study.
The SFN þ CQ combination regimen is not superior to SFN
alone with respect to inhibition of PIN or WDC. Consistent
with our previous observations (10), SFN alone is able to
modestly and signiﬁcantly inhibit WDC incidence and burden,
respectively. However, effect on WDC incidence is abolished
when SFN is combined with CQ. It is possible that SFN þ CQ
combination is more effective in inducing apoptosis in fully
transformed cells (PDC) than in preneoplastic cells (e.g., PIN).
This speculation is consistent with our earlier observations
that normal human prostate epithelial cells are resistant to

SFN-induced apoptosis (15). Relatively greater abundance of
TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells and increased cleavage of
caspase-3 in the tumors from mice treated with the SFN þ
CQ combination compared with SFN alone treatment group
(present study) provides added support to this contention.
We have shown previously that SFN treatment causes
transcriptional repression of AR in human prostate cancer
cells, leading to downregulation of AR-regulated gene product
prostate-speciﬁc antigen (20). The present study reveals that
level of AR protein in vivo is not decreased upon treatment
with SFN alone or SFN þ CQ combination. It is possible that
a more intense dosing regimen of SFN administration (i.e.,
daily administration or higher dose) is required to observe
suppression of AR protein expression in vivo. At the same time,
the possibility that SFN-mediated suppression of AR signaling
is an in vitro phenomenon cannot be discarded.
Successful implementation of a cancer chemopreventive
strategy is contingent upon systematic investigations starting with cellular studies to identify promising agents and
to deﬁne the mechanism(s) underlying their cancer protective effect to animal-based studies focusing not only on in
vivo bioavailability, safety, and efﬁcacy assessments but also
on identiﬁcation of biomarker(s) predictive of tissue exposure, and possibly response, before translation in humans
with a pilot biomarker modulation trial followed by larger
studies with cancer incidence as the primary end point.

Identiﬁcation of suitable biomarker(s) is particularly essential for the clinical development of chemopreventive agents
as cancer incidence is too rigorous of an end point for
malignancies with long latency such as prostate cancer.
Plasma proteomics conducted in the present study provides
novel leads that can be followed up to identify biomarkers
associated with SFN þ CQ exposure/response. Abundance
change of some of these proteins seems unique to the SFN þ
CQ combination. For example, abundance of alpha 1 acid
glycoprotein, which is an acute inﬂammatory biomarker that
increases in various conditions including malignancy (43), is
decreased after SFN þ CQ treatment (2.6-fold decrease
compared with control) but its level increases in the plasma
of SFN alone treated mice. We observed decreased abundance of kininogen-1 isoform 1 precursor and transthyretin
precursor in the plasma of SFN þ CQ–treated mice compared with control. Abundance of these proteins is not
altered by SFN administration alone (present study). Interestingly, transthyretin and high molecular weight kininogen
were found to be signiﬁcantly enhanced in the sera of patients with prostate cancer compared with those of benign
prostatic hyperplasia (44).
We found increased abundance of sulfated glycoprotein-2
isoform 2 in the plasma of SFN þ CQ–treated mice compared
with control. This protein is also known as clusterin and
expressed as 3 forms with different subcellular localization
(45). Expression of clusterin was shown to be downregulated
during prostate cancer progression in the TRAMP model (46).
Mice with homozygous or heterozygous deletion of clusterin
exhibited PIN or differentiated carcinoma (47). Crossing of
clusterin knockout mice with TRAMP resulted in a strong
enhancement of metastatic spread, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for clusterin (47). At the same time, some studies
have suggested oncogenic function for clusterin (48). Nevertheless, SFN þ CQ combination restores plasma level of
isoform 2 of clusterin, and this effect is not as pronounced
upon treatment with SFN alone.

Men with prostate cancer suffer signiﬁcant impairments in
quality of life not only from the disease itself but also as a
consequence of the treatments. Because the commonly associated risk factors for prostate cancer, including age, race, and
genetic predisposition are not easily modiﬁable, novel
approaches for prevention of this disease are desirable. Moreover, a clinically viable preventive intervention against prostate
cancer is still lacking (49, 50). For example, increased incidence
of high-grade tumors in the treatment arm in chemoprevention trials with 5-a-reductase inhibitors hindered their broad
acceptance as a preventive strategy (49, 50). The results of
the present study provide preclinical in vivo evidence for
prostate cancer preventive efﬁcacy of a novel and clinically
viable combination regimen to warrant investigations in a
clinical setting.
