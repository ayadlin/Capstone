ABSTRACT:
Transcription factors have long been deemed ‘undruggable’ targets for
therapeutics. Enhanced recognition of protein biochemistry as well as the need to
have more targeted approaches to treat cancer has rendered transcription factors
approachable for therapeutic development. Since transcription factors lack enzymatic
domains, the specific targeting of these proteins has unique challenges. One challenge
is the hydrophobic microenvironment that affects small molecules gaining access to
block protein interactions. The most attractive transcription factors to target are those
formed from tumor specific chromosomal translocations that are validated oncogenic
driver proteins. EWS-FLI1 is a fusion protein that results from the pathognomonic
translocation of Ewing sarcoma (ES). Our past work created the small molecule YK4-279 that blocks EWS-FLI1 from interacting with RNA Helicase A (RHA). To fulfill
long-standing promise in the field by creating a clinically useful drug, steps are
required to allow for in vivo administration. These investigations identify the need
for continuous presence of the small molecule protein-protein inhibitor for a period of
days. We describe the pharmacokinetics of YK-4-279 and its individual enantiomers.
In vivo studies confirm prior in vitro experiments showing (S)-YK-4-279 as the EWSFLI1 specific enantiomer demonstrating both induction of apoptosis and reduction
of EWS-FLI1 regulated caveolin-1 protein. We have created the first rat xenograft
model of ES, treated with (S)-YK-4-279 dosing based upon PK modeling leading to
a sustained complete response in 2 of 6 ES tumors. Combining laboratory studies,
pharmacokinetic measurements, and modeling has allowed us to create a paradigm
that can be optimized for in vivo systems using both in vitro data and pharmacokinetic
simulations. Thus, (S)-YK-4-279 as a small molecule drug is ready for continued
development towards a first-in-human, first-in-class, clinical trial.

INTRODUCTION

survival rate of 73%, while those with metastatic disease
have a survival of 20-30% after 2-3 years [2-4]. EWSR1FLI1 is the product of a t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal
translocation leading to a fusion protein, EWS-FLI1,
containing the amino half of the EWS protein and the
carboxy-half of ets family transcription factor FLI1,

Ewing Sarcoma (ES) is a rare cancer of bone or
soft tissue that affects 3 people per million each year,
largely adolescents between the ages of 10 and 25 [1].

including its DNA binding domain [5]. ES oncogenesis
is driven by the chimeric transcription factor, EWS-FLI1,
which is only present in the tumor cells of patients. The
interaction between EWS-FLI1 and RNA Helicase A
(RHA) is critical for driving ES transformation [6], and
the small molecule YK-4-279 disrupts the interaction
between EWS-FLI1 and RHA leading to apoptotic cell
death [7].
Transcription factors have largely been
considered ‘undruggable’ in general, given both their
lack of enzymatic activity and intrinsically disordered
domains that challenge crystallization [8]. EWS-FLI1
is a particularly difficult oncogene to target since it is
predicted to be an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP)
[9-11]. EWS-FLI1 has a highly conserved ets DNAbinding domain in the FLI1 portion of the protein, which
constitutes the only structured region [9, 12]. IDP-drug
interactions are generally highly specific, however, with
low affinity lending to reversible binding between the
protein and drug [13-15]. Pharmaceutical development
paradigms have proclaimed the need for nanomolar
binding drug to achieve clinical utility, however, many
current drugs show micromolar affinity for their known
targets [16]. Achieving nanomolar binding of a small
molecule to a protein may not always be possible while
maintaining drug-like molecular weight and solubility
[17, 18]. In particular, small molecule inhibitors of
protein-protein interactions may only achieve effective
concentrations in the micromolar range [19]. EWS-FLI1
is recognized as an ideal anticancer target, yet in part
due to these perceived biochemical challenges, no small
molecule has entered the clinic that directly targets this
key oncoprotein.
Our previous work demonstrated (S)-YK-4-279 as

the active enantiomer of YK-4-279 in multiple molecular
and cell biology assays [20]. This current research resolves
some of the challenges in the preclinical development
of the EWS-FLI1 inhibitor (S)-YK-4-279. Using an
iterative approach between in vitro cell line studies and
pharmacokinetics in two species, we explored various
dosing regimens and chose a continuous infusion model
for in vivo efficacy testing. (S)-YK-4-279 reduced
caveolin-1, an EWS-FLI1 regulated target gene, in vivo.
Novel rat xenograft of ES treated with continuous infusion
therapy demonstrated both achievable delivery and
promising clinical efficacy.

RESULTS
YK-4-279 induced cell death requires constant
exposure over time
We determined the replating efficiency of A4573
cells after 12 – 84 hours of treatment with 3 µM YK-4279. Cells were treated for the indicated exposure time
then replated without YK-4-279 to assay for colony
formation (Figure 1A). Colony counts show that between
the 24 and 36 hour time points there was a 3-fold decrease
in colony growth (2229±101 to 84 ±100) and by 84 hours
25±12 colonies grew, representing a 98.9% drop from
the 24 hour time point (Figure 1B). There were 53 and
25 colonies growing at 72 and 84 hours, respectively;
however, when these colonies were harvested and replated
in the continuous presence of 3 µM YK-4-279, no growth
was observed (72* and 84*).

a single oral gavage administration of racemic mixture,
(S)-YK-4-279, or (R)-YK-4-279 at a dosage level of 25
or 50 mg/kg. Racemic and (S)-YK-4-279 groups showed
average elimination half-lives of 0.583 and 0.585 hours
respectively; clearance averaged 2600 and 1260 mL/hour/
kg for racemic and (S)-YK-4-279 respectively (Table 1).
Clearance values were comparable between males and
females, but were 2.0- to 2.2-fold higher after dosing with
the racemic mixture compared to (S)-YK-4-279 (Table
1). However, given that approximately 50 percent of
the racemic mixture is (S)-YK-4-279 and the clearance
is inversely proportional to the dose, the IV clearance
of (S)-YK-4-279 is considered to be similar whether a

racemic mixture or only (S)-YK-4-279 is administered.
Systemic exposure to (S)-YK-4-279 was evaluated using
Cmax and AUC values. Cmax and AUC∞ values were similar
between males and females for a given dose group. With
an expected enantiomer ratio of 1:1 in the racemic dose,
Group 2 animals would have received a 2-fold higher
dose of (S)-YK-4-279 than Group 1 animals. Consistent
with this assumption, Cmax and AUC∞ values after a 25
mg/kg dose of only (S)-YK-4-279 were 2.1- and 2.0fold higher in males, respectively, and 2.3- and 2.2-fold
higher in females, respectively, than those after a 25 mg/
kg dose of the racemic mixture (Table 1). (R)-YK-4-279
was approximately 25% slower than the clearance of (S)-

YK-4-279 (Supplemental table 1). Oral gavage with 25
or 50 mg/kg showed a modest initial increase in plasma
concentrations following administration but plasma
levels slowly decrease through the final 12-hour time
point (Table 2). Absolute bioavailability of (S)-YK-4-279
following gavage administration, using cremophor/ethanol
as an excipient, in SD rats was only 2~6% (Table 2).
The poor oral bioavailability determined from the rat
study caused us to focus on IV delivery. Since mice often

metabolize compounds differently from rats [21], we also
evaluated the intraperitoneal (IP) PK profile and compared
it to the IV profile. We determined pharmacokinetics in
C57BL/6 mice given IV (Figure 2A) or IP (Figure 2B)
administrations of 75 mg/kg YK-4-279, which was the
maximal solubility of compound in 20% Cremophor EL.
While IP administration showed a steep rise in plasma
concentration initially, (S)-YK-4-279 was substantially
cleared leading to ~1 µM levels by 2 hours (Figure 2B).

In vivo administration of YK-4-279 reduces
xenograft growth

Xenograft growth was reduced for those mice receiving
both racemic and (S)-YK-4-279 over the control (Figure
3D, p=0.02 and p=0.003, respectively). Only the racemic
YK-4-279 treatment led to improved overall survival
(Figure 3E, p=0.013). Tumors were analyzed for drug
levels of racemic, (R)-, and (S)-YK-4-279. Three of four
mice treated with racemic compound had tumor levels of
(S)-YK-4-279 that ranged from ~12-35 µg eq/g, which
correlated with tumor growth ratios of less than 1.0,
indicating response to the drug (Figure 3F). Those animals
treated with the active (S)-YK-4-279 levels had tumor
levels that were below 10 µg eq/g (Figure 3F). Tumor
levels of (R)-YK-4-279 are also provided (Supplementary
Figure 1F).

A series of models that combined results from in
vitro colony assays and in vivo PK data were developed
to evaluate several potential dosing schemes for the
mice (Supplementary Figures 1A-E). We selected an IP
dosing strategy (twice daily (BID) injections of 375 mg/
kg racemic mixture) that would maintain a 3 µM plasma
levels for greater than 72 hours in the mice (Figure 3A).
With this IP dosing regimen, xenograft growth of A4573
was 70% less in the YK-4-279 treatment group compared
to vehicle control (Figure 3B, p=0.04). In addition, SK-ES
xenograft mice also showed 70% less growth compared
to the control group (Figure 3C, p=0.02). To confirm the
impact of YK-4-279 treatment on xenograft growth, mice
with SK-ES xenografts were treated with racemic, (S), or (R)-YK-4-279 until control tumors reached 1 cm3.

executed. Treatment was initiated with racemic, (S)-, or
(R)-YK-4-279 using BID IP administration at 400 mg/kg
when tumors were well established at a volume of 250 to
300 mm3. Both ES models treated with either racemic or
(S)-YK-4-279 regressed by 25-30% of tumor volume over
3 days, while tumors grew in control and (R)-YK-4-279
treated animals (Figures 4A and B). Two hours following
the 6th dose, mice were euthanized for tumor analysis.
The DMSO control tumors, stained with hematoxylin
and eosin, showed healthy mitotically active cells (Figure
4C), while those animals treated with racemic YK-4-279
(200 mg/kg (S) enantiomer) demonstrated vacuolar cell
death and nuclear fragmentation consistent with apoptosis
(Figure 4C). In the (S)-YK-4-279 treated animals (400
mg/kg), the cell death appeared to encompass a much
greater amount of the A4573 tumor, consistent with a
dosage effect over the racemic treatment (Figure 4C).
The (R)-YK-4-279 treated tumors neither grew as fast
as the DMSO control, nor regressed at the same rate as
the (S)- or racemic tumors, which corresponded to their
microscopic appearance of healthy tumor cells, but fewer
mitotic figures than the DMSO control (Figure 4C). To
confirm the apoptotic cell death, sections from A4573
tumors were stained with TUNEL (Figures 4D) and
there was a 3 – 4 fold increase in TUNEL-positive cells
treated with (S)-YK-4-279 compared to (R)-YK-R-279
treated tumors (Figure 4E). SK-ES tumors showed similar
TUNEL results (Supplemental Figure 2A). Levels of
each enantiomer were measured in tumor samples and
(S)-YK-4-279 levels correlated with clinical regression
(Supplemental Figure 2B - E).

and (R)-YK-4-279 treated animals shows expected
membrane caveolin-1 expression (Figure 5A). Tumors
from animals treated with racemic or (S)-YK-4-279 show
reduced caveolin-1 staining. In addition, the staining
pattern changes from membraneous to a more diffuse
pattern (Figure 5A). Each slide was scored for intensity
and distribution confirming significantly decreased

study evaluated the tumor take of 4 ES standard xenograft
cell lines (ES1, ES2, ES7, and EW8) while comparing
orthotopic and flank subcutaneous injection. Animals
received 5 million cells per site. Orthotopic injections
of ES1 and ES7 demonstrated 5 of 5 animals with
tumors, while ES2 and EW8 rates were 2 of 5 and 0 of
5 respectively (Supplemental Figure 3A). Subcutaneous
injection led to very poor tumor growth showing 4 of
20 animals amongst all 4 cell lines leading to tumors
(Supplemental Figure 3A).
The efficacy study used only ES1 and ES7 cell lines
with orthotopic injection. When animals had established
tumors, as defined by two consecutive daily tumor
volumes of greater than 2.5 cm3, they were randomly
placed into vehicle control or continuous infusion
treatment groups (72 mg/kg/day, 8 days on, 1 day off). The
dose was established from pharmacokinetic modeling with
a goal of maintaining 3 µM serum levels of (S)-YK-4-279.
Animals received infusion via a tethered central venous
catheter, which required mechanical adjustments to assure
that animals could adequately eat and drink. Photographs
show the hind legs of animals that did not grow a tumor
(Figure 6A, #23), vehicle treated ES1 animals (Figure

Continuous infusion (S)-YK-4-279 improves

The pharmacokinetic properties of (S)-YK-4-279
along with inability to deliver adequate dose over time
through bolus injections in mice suggested a need for
continuous infusion of compound. The solubility of (S)YK-4-279 precluded the use of an osmotic pump, thus
in order to deliver a continuous IV infusion, a larger
animal xenograft was developed in the nude rat. A pilot

(Figure 6A, #20, 21). The growth curves for all ES1
animals show that two animals had complete regressions
by tumor measurement, three animals had significantly
less growth than controls, and one animal (#6) grew faster
than the control animals (Figure 6B). A comparison of
tumor size on Day 19 of treatment shows a significant
difference between control and treated animals (Figure
6C, p=0.08). Representative pathology is shown (Figure
6D). In tumors that completely regressed, and did not
regrow for over 24 days, the injection site did not show
any evidence of ES cells (CD99 stain) at time of necropsy
(Figure 6D). The ES7 tumor model also responded well to
treatment, however, complete regressions were not seen
(Supplemental Figure 3B).

µg eq/g, and correlated with tumor inhibition. However,
levels of (S)-YK-4-279 were significantly less than the
expected two-fold increase based upon the dosage. This
suggests formulation of the racemic may have improved
solubility from the individual enantiomers, thus altering
bioavailability [31, 32]. An alternative explanation is that
one enantiomer affects the metabolism of the other, which
is also a testable hypothesis, however our previously
published data does not support this [20]. Alternative
explanations for differences in (S)-YK-4-279 levels could
be related to metabolism and require further evaluation.
In vitro evaluation of the enantiomeric biologic
effects demonstrated that (S)-YK-4-279 was not only
significantly more potent as an inhibitor, but also
demonstrated significant specificity upon the function of
EWS-FLI1 compared to (R)-YK-4-279 [20]. There was
a clear difference in the initiation of apoptosis with (S)YK-4-279 compared to the (R)-YK-4-279. An observation
however, with (R)-YK-4-279 treated animals showed a
small growth retardation compared to controls, yet they
did not die by apoptosis like the (S)-YK-4-279 treated
animals. Pharmacokinetics did not show racemization of
the compounds. We hypothesize that the (R)-YK-4-279
effect may be off target, as we have seen reduced growth
in non-EWS-FLI1 expressing cell lines treated with YK-4279, those cell lines also did not under go apoptosis when
treated with (S)-YK-4-279 [20].
In order to support functional inhibition of EWSFLI1 in an animal model, we were challenged by the
heterogeneity that occurs when tumor cells die in vivo.
Thus, assays in which tumors were ground-up and
homogenized followed by qRT-PCR analysis were not
successful in proving EWS-FLI1 target inhibition (data
not shown). Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we
could evaluate individual tumor cells, including regional
effects. However, a caveat of IHC is the requirement of
specific antibodies, thus we selected caveolin-1 as a wellvetted target that would have a characteristic membrane
staining pattern [22, 33]. Thus, in support of successful
EWS-FLI1 targeting, caveolin-1 was reduced in animals
treated with racemic or (S)-YK-4-279.
Efficacious clinical treatment of Ewing sarcoma
relies heavily on compounds that will disrupt function
of the primary protein driving oncogenesis, EWS-FLI1.
Because YK-4-279 abrogates function of EWS-FLI1 by
disrupting the interaction with a partner, RHA, adequate
delivery of YK-4-279 to the tumor cells is imperative for
its treatment course. In order to move this compound into
the clinic, further investigation will be needed to optimize
the formulation. In conclusion, this study supports
continued preclinical development of YK-4-279 as a novel
targeted therapy for patients with ES.

DISCUSSION
Inhibiting transcription factors derived from
chromosomal translocations, that are well recognized
as vital for the cancer, but here-to-fore designated
‘undruggable’ is a formidable challenge. These targets
that lack enzymatic sites for classic site-directed inhibitors
and are putatively intrinsically disordered proteins [10, 11,
24]. In vitro evaluation of a relatively small concentration
of 3 µM of YK-4-279 was shown to be present for
over 72 hours to get optimal cell killing. Thus, iterative
pharmacokinetic simulations led to a need for continuous
infusion dosing. These pharmacokinetic models were
validated in a both ES xenograft mouse and rat studies that
showed ES clinical tumor regression, molecular targeting,
and apoptosis.
This work shows that tumor-specific translocations
can be successfully inhibited in an animal model with
a small molecule. Intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDP) are now recognized in many diseases as critical
etiologic proteins and the biochemical properties of
these proteins actually supports their being targeted by
small molecules [25-27]. The small molecules that target
the IDP are generally lower affinity for their target than
enzyme inhibitors [18, 28-30]. In addition, proteinprotein interactions of IDP tend towards hydrophobicity.
Thus small molecule protein-protein inhibitors will also
be hydrophobic, therefore, lacking aqueous solubility.
Finally, the mechanism of blocking protein interactions
suggests that the small molecule inhibitors will need to
be present for long enough time-scales to maintain protein
separation for cell death to ensue. We chose to solve these
challenges by using continuous infusion to block the
interactions of IDP.
We measured differences in solubility between the
enantiomers (data not shown), which may account for our
comparative differences in animal studies between racemic
YK-4-279 and (S)-YK-4-279. For example, a finding
that requires further study is the correlation of plasma
drug levels with that in the tumor tissue. The racemictreated group demonstrated levels between 12 and 31

MATERIALS AND METHODS

IV Efficacy Experiment
Twenty Fox Chase SCID beige mice per sex were
inoculated with 2 million of A4573 cells. Tumor volume
was monitored every day by caliper. After tumor size
reaches 0.5 cm3, mice were randomized and received
racemic YK-4-279 at a dosage of 25 mg/kg/administration
by IV injection at 12-hour intervals through 60 hours
following the first administration (T0, T12, T24, T36, T48,
and T60). At a target of 2 hours following the last YK-4279 administration, the mice were humanely euthanized.
Blood was collected from four mice per sex and processed
to plasma, while tumor tissue was snap-frozen and stored
at -70°C until analysis of YK-4-279 concentration.

Antibodies and Reagents
Antibodies obtained commercially: Caveolin-1
(Cell Signaling, #3238, Danvers, MA), CD99 (Abcam,
#ab8855, Cambridge, MA). YK-4-279 synthesized by
AMRI, Inc. (Albany, NY) and enantiomers (S)-YK-4-279,
and (R)-YK-4-279 obtained from chiral separation of
racemic compound.

Time Point Re-plating Assay
A4573 cells were plated at a density of 2x105
cells/dish in 60 mm dishes and incubated for 8 hours
before treatment start with 3 µM racemic YK-4-279.
Cells were removed with trypsin at their respective
treatment time, cell suspensions were centrifuged, and
cells were resuspended in 500 µl of media. One hundred
microliters of cell suspension was plated in each 10
cm dish (triplicates) with 12 ml of media. Dishes were
incubated for 1 week before staining with crystal violet
stain. Colonies were counted using Nikon NIS Elements
BR Software.

Orthotopic Mouse Xenograft Model
Two million A4573 or SK-ES Ewing’s sarcoma cells
in 0.1 mL were injected into an orthotopic paraosseous
location, adjacent to the left proximal tibia, in 5-week-old
female severe combined immunodeficient-beige (SCID/
bg) mice (Harlan Laboratories, Inc., Indianapolis, IN).
After primary tumors reached 250 - 300 mm3 size, mice
were randomized and received intraperitoneal injection
(IP) with vehicle control (0.25% Lecithin solution or
DMSO), (S)-YK-4-279, (R)-YK-4-279 or racemic YK-4279 at a dose of 400 mg/kg twice a day (BID) for 7 days in
a week. The tumor volume was determined by the formula
(D x d2/6) x π, where D was the longer diameter and d
was the shorter diameter. Tumor volume was monitored
every day by caliper until the tumor size reaches 1cm3.
Mice were euthanized and primary tumors were collected.
For the pharmacodynamics study mice were randomized
and received 6 doses treatment with vehicle control
(0.25% Lecithin solution or DMSO), (S)-YK-4-279, (R)YK-4-279 or racemic YK-4-279 at a dose of 400 mg/kg
twice a day (BID). Mice were euthanized after 2 hours of
last 6th dosing and primary tumors were collected. Animal
studies were approved by an Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the Georgetown University.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis of YK-4-279 in Animal
Models
Nine SD rats of each gender were assigned to nine
dose groups. Groups 1 through 3 received a single IV
injection of racemic mixture, (S)-YK-4-279, or (R)YK-4-279 at a dose of 25 mg/kg. Groups 4 through
9 received a single gavage administration of racemic
mixture, (S)-YK-4-279, or (R)-YK-4-279 at a dosage
level of 25 or 50 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected
from one animal per group per time point at target time
points of pre-dose, 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes, and 2, 4,
8 and 12 hours following dosing. Plasma was obtained
from the samples and analyzed for (S) and (R)-YK-4-279
concentrations.
Ninety male C57/BL6 mice assigned to one of two
dosage groups and were administered racemic YK-4-279
at a single dosage of 75 mg/kg by tail vein intravenous
(IV) injection or IP administration. At a target of 5, 15,
30, and 60 minutes, and 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose
administration, blood specimens were collected from
five mice per group per time point, processed to plasma,
and stored at -70°C until analysis of (S)-YK-4-279
concentration.

Continuous Infusion Rat Xenograft Model
Six million ES1 or ES7 Ewing sarcoma cells in 0.2
mL were injected into an orthotopic paraosseous location,
adjacent to the left proximal tibia, in 6-week-old male
nude rats (Charles River, Burlington, MA). After primary
tumors reached 2.0 cm3 size, vascular catheters were
surgically placed and rats were allowed to recover. Rats
were randomized and received continuous IV infusion
of either vehicle control (15% cremophor EL) or (S)YK-4-279 was begun following two consecutive tumor
measurements of greater than 2.5 cm3. Dose administration
of vehicle control or (S)-YK4-279 for each of the three

dosing cycles consist of a single bolus injection of 4 mg/
kg and 8 days of 9 days continuous infusion at a dose
2.5 mg/ml and a target rate 5 µl/min (72 mg/kg/day) to
produce a steady state plasma drug level of 3 µM. The
tumor volume was determined by the formula (D x d2/6) x
π, where D was the longer diameter and d was the shorter
diameter. Tumor volume was monitored every day by
caliper until the tumor size reaches 20 cm3. Rats were
euthanized and primary tumors were collected. Animal
studies were approved by an Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the Battelle.

molds. Tissue sections were cut at 5 microns and placed
onto Superfrost Plus charged slides (Fisher Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA). Hematoxylin and Eosin (Leica
Microsystem Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL) staining was
performed on a Leica Autostainer XL.
Five micron sections from formalin fixed paraffin
embedded tissues were de-paraffinized with xylenes and
rehydrated through a graded alcohol series. Heat induced
epitope retrieval was performed by immersing the tissue
sections at 98oC for 20 minutes in 10 mM citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) with 0.05% Tween. IHC staining was performed
using the VectaStain Kit from Vector Labs (Burlingame,
CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The
sections were evaluated, in blinded fashion two times, by
a pathologist (B.K.).

Determination of YK-4-279 Concentrations and
PK Analysis
The plasma and tumor sample analysis was
performed using calibration standards and Quality
Control (QC) samples prepared in control rat or mouse
plasma and tumor tissues. Plasma and tumor calibration
standards were prepared from stock solutions of YK4-279. The calibration standards, blanks, QC samples,
and study samples were then processed by solid-liquid
extraction (SLE) followed by analysis using liquid
chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The
LC-MS systems used for the analysis of YK-4-279 was
composed of Shimadzo prominence pump and autosampler (Kyoto, Japan), a Sciex API 5000 MS (Toronto,
Ontario), with turbo ion spary in the positive ion mode.
The samples for the analysis of total YK-4-279 were
injected into a 50 x 2 mm Gemini- NX, 5 µm column
(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The samples for the analysis
of the specific enantiomers of YK-4-279 were injected
into a 150 x 2 mm Lux Cellulose-2, 3 µm Phenomenex
column. The transitions monitored were 366 amu to 135
amu for YK-4-279 and 369 amu to 138 amu for the YK4-279-d3 internal standard. YK-4-279 concentrations
were calculated using peak area response ratios and a
regression equation constructed from the concentrations
and peak area response ratios of the calibration standards.
The lower limit of quantitation was 5.0 ng/mL in plasma
and 5.0 µg/g in tumor tissue. The concentration-time
profiles were evaluated by compartmental modeling and
non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin (Pharsight
Corporation, Mountain View, CA). The PK parameters
obtained from the compartmental modeling were used
in simulations to identify optimal dose level and dosing
schedule for maintaining plasma concentration of (S)YK-4-279 above 3 µM.

Statistical Analysis
Xenograft tumor growth study used the unpaired
t test with Welch’s correction (Figure 3 B and C). For
xenograft tumor growth study and calveolin-1 IHC index
used ordinary one-way ANOVA (Figure 3D, Figure 4
A and B, Figure 5B). Survival was estimated with the
Kaplan-Meier method and unstratified log-rank statistical
analysis to test for differences, with pairwise comparison
between groups (Figure 3E). All statistical tests were
two-tailed. Tissue IHC experiments were conducted in
duplicate. In vitro studies were validated in triplicate
experiments.
