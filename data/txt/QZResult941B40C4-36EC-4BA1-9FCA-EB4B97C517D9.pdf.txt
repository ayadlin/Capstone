ABSTRACT
Thymoquinone (TQ) has been reported to possess anti-tumor activity in various
types of cancer. However, its effects and molecular mechanism of action in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still not completely understood. We observed
that TQ inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro, where treatment with TQ arrested the cell
cycle in G1 by upregulating p21 and downregulating cyclinD1 and CDK2 expression;
moreover, TQ induced apoptosis by decreasing expression of Bcl-2 and increasing
expression of Bax. Simultaneously, TQ demonstrated a suppressive impact on the
Notch pathway, where overexpression of NICD1 reversed the inhibitory effect of TQ
on cell proliferation, thereby attenuating the repressive effects of TQ on the Notch
pathway, cyclinD1, CDK2 and Bcl-2, and also diminishing upregulation of p21 and Bax.
In a xenograft model, TQ inhibited HCC growth in nude mice; this inhibitory effect
in vivo, as well as of HCC cell growth in vitro, was associated with a discernible decline
in NICD1 and Bcl-2 levels and a dramatic rise in p21 expression. In conclusion, TQ
inhibits HCC cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, achieving these
effects by repression of the Notch signaling pathway, suggesting that TQ represents
a potential preventive or therapeutic agent in HCC patients.

[2–3]. Potentially curative treatments for early-stage
HCC include surgical resection, liver transplantation,
and ablation. However, high rates of tumor recurrence
after resection or ablation constitute a major challenge,
with recurrence rates as high as 70% at 5 years [4].
Palliative therapy for intermediate-advanced HCC
includes transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)
and sorafenib [5–7], but curative effect is difficult
to achieve. Therefore, effective treatment agents are
urgently needed in this disease.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth
most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third
most common cause of cancer death worldwide. An
estimated 748,300 new cases and 695,900 cancer deaths
occurred from HCC in 2008. Half of these cases and
deaths were estimated to occur in China [1]. HCC
incidence rates are increasing rapidly in many parts
of the world, including the United States and Europe

RESULTS

Nigella sativa is a widely distributed plant in
Mediterranean countries, Pakistan and India, whose seed
(black cumin) has been commonly used as a spice, as well
as in preservatives and medications, over the past several
thousand years; this seed has biological activities including
anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, anti-platelet,
anti-atherosclerotic, and anti-diabetic effects [8]. Nigella
has demonstrated clinical therapeutic activity in many
diseases, including bronchial asthma, diarrhea, headache,
gastrointestinal illnesses, eczema, hypertension, and obesity
[9]. Moreover, there are no obvious adverse effects of this
substance. Thymoquinone (TQ), or 2-isopropyl-5-methyl-1,
4-benzoquinone, is the most active monomer isolated from
black cumin, with a defined chemical structure (Fig. 1A).
Many studies demonstrate that TQ exhibits a broad
antitumor activity spectrum [10–13].
There are four transmembrane Notch proteins
(Notch 1–4) in mammals [14] and five ligands: Jagged
(Jagged 1, 2) and Delta-like (DLL-1, 3, 4), belonging
to two protein families [15]. Activation of Notch
signaling requires linking of the Notch receptor to its
respective ligand in a strictly controlled fashion. The
Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released after
Notch receptors undergo a series of proteolytic cleavages
[16–17], and NICD then translocates into the nucleus
to modulate the expression of Hes1 [18], Bcl-2 [19],
and other target genes, which mediate cell proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis, processes that are key to the
development and progression of cancer [20–24].
TQ has anti-neoplastic effects on a variety of human
cancer cells [10–13]. Recent preliminary reports showed
that TQ inhibits HCC growth in vitro [25], but potential
molecular mechanisms involved in this antitumor effect,
in particular its impact on the Notch pathway, along with
antitumor effects in vivo, have not been studied. Therefore,
the present study was conducted to explore the effects
and mechanisms of action of TQ against HCC growth
in vitro  and in vivo.

TQ inhibits the growth of human HCC cells
in vitro
We examined the effect of TQ on HCC cell
proliferation in several HCC-derived cell lines (Hep3B,
SMMC7721, HepG2, Bel7402, MHCC97-L, MHCC97-H
and HHCC) by MTT assay. Cells with different degrees of
differentiation were treated with 20, 40, 60 and 80 μM TQ.
TQ significantly inhibited the proliferation of these tumor
cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This
anti-proliferative impact was observed within a 24-hour
period, and it continued to increase over the next 72 hours
(Fig. 1B-1H).

Notch1 expression in human HCC cell lines and
normal liver cells
To explore whether Notch1 is expressed in
HCC cells, qRT-PCR analysis was performed in seven
HCC cell lines and in primary normal liver epithelial
cells (L-02). All seven HCC cell lines expressed higher
levels of Notch1 mRNA than did L-02 cells (P < 0.05).
Hep3B and SMMC7721 expressed the highest levels of
Notch1 mRNA among the HCC cell lines tested (Fig. 2).
We therefore chose Hep3B and SMMC7721 for further
research.

TQ induces cell cycle arrest by upregulating
p21 and downregulating cyclinD1 and CDK2
expression
To investigate whether inhibition of cell proliferation
was associated with cell cycle arrest, we performed
flow cytometry to analyze cell cycle distribution
after treatment with TQ for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 3A-3B,
Hep3B cells  treated with TQ (20, 40, and 60 μM)

demonstrated an increase in the proportion of cells in G0/
G1 phase (79 ± 5.1, 85 ± 5.5, 88 ± 5.9) vs. control (0 μM)
or DMSO-treated cells (56 ± 3.8 or 58 ± 4.6, respectively),
as well as a decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase
(16 ± 3, 13 ± 3.2, 11 ± 2.1) vs. control or DMSO-treated
groups (27 ± 2.9 or 26 ± 2.8, respectively). In SMMC7721
cells, TQ also induced G1-phase arrest in a concentrationdependent manner. To clarify the mechanism of G1
accumulation induced by TQ, we measured expression
levels of the cell cycle-related proteins p21, cyclinD1,
and CDK2 using Western blot analysis. Results showed
that p21 was significantly upregulated, while cyclinD1
and CDK2 were significantly downregulated in
a concentration-dependent manner following 48 h of TQ
treatment (Fig. 3C).

In addition to cell cycle arrest, we assumed that
inhibition of cell growth induced by TQ treatment
could also have been caused by programmed cell death.
Therefore, we investigated whether TQ induces apoptosis.
We measured the number of apoptotic cells after
treatment with TQ for 48 h and observed that apoptotic
cells were dramatically increased in TQ-treated (20, 40,
and 60 μM) Hep3B cells (15.38 ± 3.78, 76.45 ± 7.4,
86.52 ± 8.1) vs. control and DMSO-treated cells (4.87
± 1.32, 5.9 ± 2.1), while apoptotic cells numbered (6.23
± 1.07, 27.85 ± 5.67, 67.09 ± 6.97) in TQ-treated (20,
40, and 60  μM) SMMC7721 cells and (5.55 ± 1.39,

5.23 ± 2.04) in control and DMSO-treated SMMC7721
cells, respectively (Fig. 4A-4B). To further investigate
the molecular mechanisms underlying these pro-apoptotic
effects, we measured expression of the apoptosis-related
proteins Bcl-2 and Bax using Western blotting. TQ
decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and increased the
expression of Bax proteins (Fig. 4C).

(Fig. 5C). WB revealed that forced NICD1 overexpression
caused attenuation of TQ’s inhibitory effects on expression
of Notch1, Jagged1, Hes1, cyclinD1, CDK2 and Bcl-2,
as well as on TQ-induced upregulation of p21 and Bax
(Fig. 5D). These results suggest that TQ inhibits tumor cell
growth via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, induction at least
in part due to repression of Notch signaling.

The Notch pathway is involved in the anti-cancer
effect of TQ on human HCC cells

TQ inhibits the growth of hepatocellular
carcinoma in vivo

We hypothesized that TQ-induced growth suppression
of HCC cells could be related to the Notch signaling
pathway. To confirm this possibility, we  determined
the effects of TQ on Notch signaling in Hep3B and
SMMC7721 cells. Western blotting demonstrated that TQ
inhibited the expression of Notch1, NICD1, Jagged1 and
Hes1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). To
further elucidate the role of Notch1 in the TQ response,
we transfected Hep3B and SMMC7721 cells with pIRESNICD1-EGFP vector, expressing human NICD1. Initial
testing verified that transfection of these cells with this vector
successfully and significantly promoted overexpression of
NICD1 (Fig. 5B). We then explored whether the inhibitory
effect of TQ on cell growth and expression of cell cyclerelated and apoptosis-related proteins was related to
suppression of Notch signaling. After transient transfection
with the NICD1 vector for 6 h, Hep3B and SMMC7721 cells
were incubated in the presence or absence of TQ (60 μM) for
48 h. The cells were then subjected to in vitro MTT assays
and WB analysis. Results showed that forced overexpression
of NICD1 reversed the inhibitory effects of TQ on cell
growth. MTT assay results in control, TQ, pIRES-NICD1
and TQ+pIRES-NICD1 groups were 0.9 ± 0.1, 88.15 ± 9.48,
43 ± 3.81, and 57.5 ± 10.1 in Hep3B cells, respectively,
while corresponding values were 0.8 ± 0.2, 61.79 ± 9.35,
29.7 ± 4.1, and 40.8 ± 4.75 in SMMC7721 cells, respectively

In order to verify our in vitro observation and
to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of TQ in vivo,
we  analyzed its influence on the growth of liver
tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice. TQ (5 mg/kg/d
and 20 mg/kg/d) was administered subcutaneously (s.c.)
beginning when Hep3B tumors reached 150 mm3.
As shown in Fig. 6A, TQ treatment caused a statistically
significant  tumor  volume  decrease vs. the control
group (p < 0.01) at day 31: the average tumor volumes
in TQ-treated (5mg/kg/d or 20 mg/kg/d) vs. solventtreated control mice were 710 ± 37.6 or 537 ± 32.5 cm3
vs. 1022.3 ± 387.1 cm3, respectively (p < 0.05). There
was no statistical difference in average body weights
(22.6 ± 2.9 g in the 5mg/kg/d group and 21.1 ± 3.2 g
in the 20mg/kg/d group vs. 23.5 ± 4.1 g in controls),
indicating that TQ exerted no obvious deleterious
side effects in tumor-bearing mice. Fig. 6B-6C shows
that tumor sizes and weights in TQ-treated mice were
significantly smaller than in solvent-treated mice.
In addition, H&E staining of the control and 5 mg/kg/d
TQ-treated groups confirmed that tumor xenografts
had been successfully established in both groups
(Fig. 7A-7B). H&E staining of kidney epithelial cells
in the 20 mg/kg/d TQ-treated group revealed normal
histology (Fig.  7C), further establishing that TQ
exerted minimal toxicity. We next investigated whether

Bax) proteins was measured by western blot analysis.

DISCUSSION

TQ-inhibited tumor growth in mice was associated with
inactivation of the Notch pathway and expression of p21
and Bcl-2, as in cultured cells. Immunohistochemical
staining of tumor tissue revealed that TQ treatment
at the doses of 5mg/kg and 20mg/kg increased the
expression of p21 protein, while this treatment inhibited
the  expression of NICD1 and Bcl-2 vs. controls
(Fig. 7D-7L). Overall, these observations demonstrate
that TQ inhibits the growth of HCC cells both in vitro
and in vivo, associated with reduced activity of the
Notch signaling pathway and induction of cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis.

Herbs contain potent bioactive natural substances,
which are commonly used to treat a variety of diseases
including rheumatological disorders [26] and breast
cancer [27–28]. TQ extracted from Nigella sativa has
been used by multiple human societies for centuries,
and this substance has shown anti-tumor activity against
lymphoblastic leukemia, breast cancer, prostate, and
pancreatic cancer cells [10–13]. However, its effect and
underlying molecular mechanisms in HCC have not been
previously clarified. Our studies reveal, to our knowledge

for the first time, that TQ induces anti-proliferative and
apoptotic effects in HCC in vitro and in vivo, at least
in part by inhibiting the Notch pathway. Based on our
findings that TQ inhibits growth of cancer cells without
conspicuous toxicity, this natural substance represents
a promising new agent for the treatment and/or prevention
of liver cancer.

Regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation is
closely associated with activation of cell cycle-dependent
cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK
inhibitors. The D-type cyclins with their matched kinase
partners result in G1 progression, while cyclin E interacts
with CDK2 and plays a significant role in cell cycle
progression past the G1 phase [29]. p21, a key CDK

32615

inhibitor, can inactivate the cyclin/CDK complex, causing
efficient cell cycle arrest [30]. In this study, we found
that TQ effectively blocked G1-phase HCC cells from
entering S-phase. Furthermore, our data illustrated that TQ
suppressed the expression of cyclinD1 and CDK2, while
simultaneously boosting p21 levels, which correlated
with G1-phase arrest and growth suppression. According
to reports by Shin [31], TQ induces cell cycle arrest by
increasing p21.
As is known, cancer development and progression
are attributed to destruction of the balance between cell
proliferation and apoptosis [32]. Apoptosis is mediated by
several cascade proteins, especially members of the Bcl-2
family and Bax [33]. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein,
while Bax (Bcl-2 Antagonist X) is a pro-apoptotic protein
with the ability to antagonize Bcl-2, thereby increasing
the activation of caspases, altering mitochondrial
permeability, and triggering mitochondrial pathway
apoptosis [34]. In the present study, we observed that TQ
treatment of HCC cells increased Bax expression and
diminished Bcl-2 expression. These expression alterations
of Bax and Bcl-2 highlight a high Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, which
is a significant  factor in determining susceptibility to
apoptosis: high Bax/Bcl-2 ratios resulted in a higher
proportion of apoptotic cells than in control groups. These
results establish that the apoptosis-promoting effect of TQ
on Hep3B and SMMC7721 cells was at least in part due
to modulation of Bcl-2 and Bax.
The Notch pathway is genetically altered in many
hematopoietic and solid tumors, resulting in activation
or repression of this pathway in the context of other
oncogenic signaling pathways [35]. Many studies [21–24,
36–39] have confirmed that Notch can function as either
an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene, manifesting
oncogenic roles in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
lung adenocarcinoma, and colorectal cancer, but tumorsuppressive activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
lung squamous cell carcinoma, and cutaneous squamous
cell carcinoma. However, whether activated Notch inhibits
or promotes HCC cell growth is still controversial.
Qi  et al. found that activated NOTCH1 represses liver
cancer cells growth by the induction of cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis [40], suggesting that Notch functions as
a tumor suppressor in the liver. In contrast, two research
groups revealed that the activated intracellular domain
of Notch1 [41] or Notch2 [42] induces liver cancer
development. In accordance with the reported conclusion
of Villanueva et al. [41], our result demonstrated that
levels of Notch1 mRNA expression in HCC cell lines
were higher than in normal liver cells. Previous reports
[43–44] showed that Notch2 or Notch3 are involved in
gastric carcinogenesis or lung cancer progression. We
found no statistically significant differences in Notch2 or
Notch3 expression between HCC cells and normal liver
cells (Fig. S1, S2); therefore, we did not choose Notch2
or Notch3 for further studies. To further investigate the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

possible molecular mechanism of TQ in the inhibition
of HCC growth, we measured protein levels of Notch1,
NICD1, Jagged1 and Hes1 in HCC cells. Our results
indicated that expression levels of Notch1, NICD1,
Jagged1 and Hes1 were markedly lower in TQ-treated
cells than in control cells.
Furthermore, we observed that forced
overexpression of NICD1 reversed the inhibitory
effects of TQ on HCC cell proliferation . Our results
also confirmed that TQ inhibited protein expression of
Notch1 (receptor), Jagged1 (ligand), NICD1 (nuclear
transcriptional factor), and Hes1 (downstream Notch
pathway target gene) after transfection of a NICDexpressing vector, in agreement with our observed
effects of TQ on HCC cells before transfection,
suggesting that TQ attenuates Notch pathway activity.
TQ also suppressed cyclinD1, CDK2 and Bcl-2, while
blocking upregulation of p21 and Bax in Hep3B and
SMMC7721 cells after NICD transfection. These results
suggest that TQ inhibits the expression of cyclinD1,
CDK2 and Bcl-2 while accelerating the expression
of p21 and Bax, at least in part via repression of
Notch signaling. A number of studies have shown
that activated Notch can modulate expression of p21
and Bcl-2 [45–46], suggesting that p21 and Bcl-2 are
downstream of TQ- induced Notch inhibition, and
suggesting that TQ may restore normal proliferation and
apoptosis by downregulating the Notch pathway.
γ-secretase is a proteolytic enzyme complex that
contains transmembrane domains, comprised of a catalytic
subunit (Presenilin-1 (PS-1) or PS-2) and accessory
subunits (Aph1, Pen-2 and nicastrin) [17]. Inhibition of
γ-secretase (GSI) blocks NICD, which travels into the
nucleus, where it activates the expression of downstream
target genes [18–19]. We determined the percentage
of apoptotic cells after treatment with TQ 40 μM, GSI
(1 μM), or TQ+GSI for 48 h. Apoptotic cells numbered
(75.13 ± 7.1)% after 40 μM TQ treatment in Hep3B cells,
(4.32 ± 1.27) in control group, (51 ± 4.6)% in 1 μM GSItreated Hep3B cells, and (99 ± 0.5)% in the TQ+GSI
treatment group (Fig. S3). We could not perform further
research with GSI because we had already reached nearly
100% apoptosis in the combined treatment group.
Finally, our in vivo studies suggested that TQ
inhibits tumor formation in xenografted mice by
suppressing Notch-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
Several studies have illustrated the role of TQ in
cancer metastasis. Khan et al. reported that TQ inhibits
metastasis of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells by
decreasing
epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition
(EMT) [47]. Siveen et al. found that TQ enhances
chemosensitization and anticancer activity of Bortezomib
in human multiple myeloma cells and mouse xenografts
via inhibition of the NF-κB pathway [48]. It has
reported that TQ represses tumor growth by modulating
p38,  STAT-3, PPAR-γ and other signaling pathways.

[11, 49–52]. Hence, these events may also be responsible
for TQ-induced inhibitory effects on the growth of
HCC xenografts mice in our present study. It would be
interesting to evaluate whether TQ inhibits these other
pathways in future studies.
In summary, our study clarifies the inhibitory
effect of TQ on growth of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo.
Moreover, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by TQ
may be attributed, at least in part, to repression of the
Notch signaling pathway. We have presented evidence
showing that cell cycle arrest and apoptosis associated
with Notch pathway inhibition are mechanisms by which
TQ can inhibit HCC growth. These observations suggest
that TQ should be considered as a promising agent for the
prevention or treatment of HCC.

(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The inhibition rate (IR)
of cell growth was calculated by formula: mean value of
(1-treated group/control group) × 100%.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the cultured cells with
the RNeasy Mini kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized
using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Systemkit
(Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
was carried out (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) using
SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Tli RNase H Plus) (TaKaRa,
Japan). The specific primers were as follows:Notch1,
forward 5′-CCGCAGTTGTGCTCCTGAA-3′and reverse
5′-ACCTTGGCGGTCTCGTAGCT-3′; β-actin, forward
5′-CTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTTCCT-3′
and
reverse
5′-AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG-3′. The housekeeping
gene β-actin was used as an internal control. The analyses
of Notch1 data were according to the 2-ßßCt mVethod.

Reagents
Thymoquinone was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and Dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) were provided by Sigma Chemicals
Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Primary antibodies against
Notch1, NCD1, Jagged1, Hes1, Bcl-2, and Bax were
ordeded from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Anti-p21,
anti-cyclinD1, anti-CDK2 and anti-β-actin were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).
Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Gibco-BRL

Expression plasmid construction and cell
transfection
The full coding region that encodes human
NICD1 (GenBank accession No. NM_017617.3)
was amplified by PCR using primers (forward
5′-CTCGAGAATATGGTGCTGCTGTCCCGCAAG-3′
and reverse 5′-GGATCCGCACACAGACGCCCGAA
GG-3′) from cDNA of U251 glioma cells [53]. The product
was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, WI,
USA) and conducted sequence analysis. The correct
NICD1 cDNA subsequently was cloned into XhoI and
BamHI sites of the bicistronic expression vector pIRES2EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) (Clontech Inc,
Palo Alto, CA), allowing for translation of both target
genes and the EGFP, and generated pIRES2-NICD1EGFP. For transient transfection experiments, the cells
were cultured 24 h before transfection in a 6-cm dish at a
density of 2 × 105 cells per dish. Transfecttion of the cells
was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
CA, USA) with pIRES-NICD1-EGFP vector (pIRESNICD1) and pIRES-EGFP empty vector (pIRES-EGFP)
(as a negative control) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

The human HCC cell lines (Hep3B, SMMC7721,
HepG2, Bel7402, MHCC97-L, MHCC97-H and HHCC)
and normal liver cell line (L-02) were ordered from the
Shanghai Institutes of Biological Sciences. Cells were grown
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100  U/mL
penicillin and 2.5 mmol/L glutamine. All cells were cultured
in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C.

We used MTT assay to detect live cells as
per manufacturer’s instructions. In Brief, Hep3B,
SMMC7721, HepG2, Bel7402, MHCC97-L, MHCC97-H
and HHCC cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density
of 6000 per well, incubated in in appropriate medium for
24 to 48 h, then treated with ascending concentrations of
TQ (20–80 μmol/L) for different time periods (24, 48 and
72 h). Cells were subsequently cultured d in medium with
0.5 mg/ml MTT for another 4 h. Following removal of
the supernatant and adding 150 μl DMSO, the optical
density(OD) at 490nm was determined by ELISA reader
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cell cycle distribution analysis
Cells were incubated in 6-well plates at a density
of 1.6 × 106 cells per well, and dealt with various
concentrations of TQ for 48 h when grown to 60%
confluence. The cells from each well were collected and
fixed with 70% ethanol overnight, following suspended
by 0.5 ml PI (propidium iodide, Sigma-Aldrich) staining
solution (50 μg/ml PI, 0.2% TritonX-100 in PBS and
100 μg/ml RNase) for half an hour at room temperature
in dark place. Cell cycle distribution was determined

by a  FACS Calibur flow cytometer and the CellQuest
software (Becton-Dickinson). All of the cell cycle
experiments were conducted in triplicate.

were randomly divided into the following 3 groups(n = 5
in each group): control group given solvent (mixture of
PBS/cremophor/ethanol, 5:3:2), TQ 5 mg/kg/d group,
TQ 20 mg/kg/d group [12, 55]. When the tumor volumes
of the control group reached ~1,100 mm3 (on day 31),
the experiment was ended and the mice were sacrificed.
Tumor tissue was immediately removed and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde.

Assessment of cell apoptosis
Quantitative analysis of apoptosis was valuated
using FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit
(Joincare Biosciences, Zhuhai, China) according to the
manufacturer’s directions. Tumor cells were cultured at
a density of 1.6 × 106 cells per well into 6-well plates,
then were treated with indicated concentrations of TQ
(0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 μM) and incubated for 48 h. Cells
were resuspended by 500 μl 1× Annexin-binding buffer
and stained with 5 ul AnnexinV-FITC, followed addition
of 10 μl PI for 15 min. The percentage of apoptotic cells
was analyzed by FACS Calibur flow cytometer.

Immunohistochemistry
The study was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of Xi’an Jiaotong University. HCC samples from
mice xenograft were examined immunohistochemically
by treptavidin-peroxidase (SP) method, as described
previously [56]. Briefly, paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin
embedded tissues were cut into 4-μm sections. The sections
were dewaxed, dehydrated, following antigen retrieval in
a pressure cooking for 5 min then incubated with 0.3%
(v/v) hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to block non-specific
antigens and any endogenous enzyme. The sections were
incubated with normal goat serum for 10 min then with
the primary antibody against NICD1, P21 or Bcl-2 at 4°C
overnight. The slides were washed with PBS and incubated
with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100  dilution;
Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China)
for 20 min as the secondary antibodies. Each slide was
colored with DAB (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in a
dark room before incubated with peroxidase-conjugated
streptavidin (Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology) for
10 min. At last, all the sections were rinsed with running
water, counterstained by hematoxylin and dehydrated
in graded ethanol. The slides were read and marked by
two independent pathology experts under a microscope
(Olympus Optical Co, Tokyo, Japan). Haematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining was performed according to regular
procedures.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as previously
described [54]. Protein extraction was prepared from TQtreated and control group cells cultured in 6-cm dishes.
The cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer. The
protein (40–60 μg) was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Millipore, MA, USA) after its quantification.
The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in
tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST) at 37°C for 2 h,
subsequently were incubated with the primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C, Horseradish peroxidase-linked antirabbit IgG (1:3,000) was used as the secondary antibody,
then incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The
antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Millipore, MA, USA). The band
density was measured using Image Lab 4.0 (Bio-Rad)
imaging software. Expression levels of the protein are
assessed by a densitometric ratio of the targeted protein to
the β-actin housekeeping protein.

Statistical analysis

Human liver tumor xenograft mouse model

All experiments were repeated independently at least
3 times. Data are presented as the means ± SEM. Statistical
comparisons were analyzed using one-way ANOVA or the
Student’s t-test. Differences were considered to indicate
statistically significant with P < 0.05. All tests and
p-values were two-sided. Statistical analysis was carried
out using SPSS20.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, USA).

Four-week-old male athymic nude mice (BALB/c),
weighing 18–22 g, were purchased from Shanghai
Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China) and
maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in
accordance with Laboratory Animal Centre of Xi’an
Jiaotong University animal care guidelines. Use and
treatment of the animal were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Xi’an Jiaotong
University. Hep3B cells (2 × 106) were injected s.c. into
one flank. Tumor size and body weight was measured
every other day. Tumor volume (V) was calculated with
the formula V = (L × W2) × 0.5 where L is the length
of the tumor and the W is the width. When a volume of
xenografts reached ~150 mm3, 15 tumor-bearing mice
