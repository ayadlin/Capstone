ABSTRACT
Increased lipogenesis and protein synthesis is a hallmark of cancer cell
proliferation, survival, and metastatic progression and is under intense investigation
as a potential antineoplastic target. Acetyltanshinone IIA (ATA) is a compound
that was obtained from chemical modifications of tanshinone IIA (TIIA), a potent
anticancer agent extracted from the dried roots of the Chinese herbal medicine Salvia
miltiorrhiza Bunge. A previous investigation indicated that ATA is more effective in
inhibiting the growth of breast cancer especially cells with HER2 overexpression.
However, the molecular mechanism(s) mediating this cytotoxic effect on HER2positive breast cancer remained undefined. Studies described here report that ATA
induced G1/S phase arrest and apoptosis in the HER2-positive MDA-MB-453, SK-BR-3,
and BT-474 breast cancer cell lines. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the ATAinduced apoptosis effect is associated with remarkably down-regulation of receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) EGFR/HER2 and inhibition of their downstream pro-survival
signaling pathways. Interestingly, ATA was found to trigger oxidative and endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stresses and to activate AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) leading
to inactivation of key enzymes involved in lipid and protein biogenesis. Intraperitoneal
administration of ATA significantly inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-453 xenografts
in athymic mice without causing weight loss and any other side effects. Additionally,
transwell migration, invasion, and wound healing assays revealed that ATA could
suppress tumor angiogenesis in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest that ATA may
have broad utility in the treatment of HER2-overexpressed breast cancers.

of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER,
also known as ErbB) family in the development and
progression of various cancers is widely recognized [3].
Family members include four receptors: HER1 (EGFR/
ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3), and HER4
(ErbB4) [4]. Each has been reported to be amplified or
overexpressed in some forms of breast cancer, with

Breast cancer is by far the most common noncutaneous malignancy affecting women worldwide.
Despite considerable progress in both diagnosis and
treatment, breast cancer remains the second leading cause
of cancer-related death in women [1, 2]. The importance

HER2 and EGFR being the most extensively studied.
Overexpression of HER2, found in more than 30%
of breast cancer cases [5, 6], is associated with poor
prognosis and considered as a predictive marker of
chemoresistance. Thus, therapeutic strategies focusing
on the inhibition of this oncogene are now being actively
explored in breast cancer therapy.
Cancer metabolic reprogramming, such as enhanced
glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis, has been recognized
as  one of the important characteristic features of cancer
[7, 8]. Increased lipogenesis, found in approximately 20%
to 90% of cancer cases, is a hallmark of aggressive cancers
and is reflected in the up-regulation of key enzymes
involved in this multiple step process [9]. These include
fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(ACC) and ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). Several studies
reported that these lipogenic enzymes are overexpressed
in a number of human malignancies including breast
cancer [9–14]. Interestingly, their inhibitions by
specific inhibitors or siRNA caused significant growth
suppression and induced apoptosis in different cancer
models [15–20]. New and effective therapeutic agents and
strategies targeting these key biosynthetic enzymes are
now being actively explored in anticancer therapies [9, 15,
17, 21–24]. Importantly, recent investigations suggest
a cross-talk between these metabolic enzymes and the
human epidermal growth factor receptor family, especially
HER2, via different signaling pathways [12, 25, 26].
Natural products derived from plants are
major resources of prospective chemopreventive and
chemotherapeutic candidates [27, 28]. Tanshinone IIA is
one of the most active components found in the dried roots
of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (also known as Danshen).
Previous studies indicated that tanshinone IIA possesses
potent anti-inflammatory [29] and growth inhibitory
properties against different cancer types [30–35].
Acetyltanshinone IIA (ATA) is a novel compound that was
chemically modified from tanshinone IIA (Fig. 1A) and
has been identified as a promising agent against breast
cancer [36]. The current study show the potent anti-cancer
activity of ATA on HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells and explore its in vivo therapeutic potential in a
mouse xenograft model of HER2-amplified breast cancer.
Furthermore, mechanistic investigations described here
reveal a novel anticancer mechanism of ATA via targeting
different oncogenic signaling pathways.

a significant time- and dose-dependent reduction in the
viability of all tested cell lines (Fig. 1B) with a 50%
inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranging between 2 μM
and 9 μM as determined by CCK-8 assay (Table 1).
To ascertain whether ATA had any selectivity for normal
versus cancer cells, human normal breast epithelial cells
MCF-10A was treated with ATA. We found that the IC50
value for this normal breast cell line is significantly
higher than the IC50 values of ATA on breast cancer cells
(Table 1). Thus, ATA was more able to selectively inhibit
the growth of breast cancer cells than non-cancer ones.

ATA mediated inhibition of cancer cell growth by
inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
To determine the cause and the nature of cell death
by which ATA mediated its cytotoxic effects on HER2positive breast cancer cells, cell cycle progression and
apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. Data revealed
that treatment with ATA caused S phase cell cycle arrest in
MDA-MB-453 cells whereas SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells
were arrested at G1 phase when treated with the low dose
of 5 μM and S phase when treated with the high dose of
20 μM. The representative FACS histograms are shown
in Fig. 1C. Additionally, a dose-dependent increase in the
sub-G1 and Annexin V-positive cell populations observed
in ATA-treated groups indicate an induction of apoptosis
(Fig. 1C and 1D).
To examine the molecular alterations associated with
these events, expression levels of several cell cycle and
apoptosis-related proteins were determined by Western
blot analysis. As expected, cellular levels of G1-S phases
proteins: Cyclin D1, cdk4 and 6 (G0/G1 phase); and
Cyclin A, cdk2 (S phase) were markedly down-regulated
following ATA treatment (Fig. 1E). Moreover, our data
indicate that ATA resulted in an increase of cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p21 and a decrease of retinoblastoma
(Rb) phosphorylation at serine 780, serine 795, and serine
807/811 (Fig. 1E). Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP),
an early marker of apoptosis, was found to be cleaved doseand time-dependently following ATA exposure (Fig. 1F).
Additionally, morphological changes demonstrated
by Hoechst 33258 staining confirmed the induction of
apoptosis (Fig. 1G). Together, our results clearly indicate
that the anticancer activity of ATA on breast cancer cells is
associated with induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
and that this action is not only time- and dose-dependent but
also cell line-specific.

cellular levels of HER2 and its dimerization partner EGFR
(Fig. 2A). The phosphorylation/activation status of these
oncoproteins was also strongly reduced in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Next, we analyzed the
effect of ATA on signaling pathways usually activated by
these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Western blotting
data revealed a down-regulation of the phosphorylation
status of Akt, Stat3, and NFκB p65 (Fig. 2A, 2B, and 2C).
In some instances, the reduced phosphorylation was
accompanied by concomitant reduction of total protein
amounts (Fig. 2A, 2B, and 2C).

achieved through impedance of a variety of enzymatic
steps in the pathway. In the current study, expression
levels of three key lipid biosynthetic enzymes (ACLY,
FASN, ACC) were verified by Western blot. As shown
in Fig. 3A, treatment with ATA resulted in a decrease
of the protein levels of FASN and p-ACLY compared to
those in DMSO-treated control cells. No change in total
ACLY was observed. Simultaneously, cellular levels of
p-ACC significantly increased following ATA exposure
(Fig. 3A). Moreover, evaluation of the cellular level
of AMPK, a metabolic sensor of cellular energy state,
indicated that ATA induced the activation of AMPK with
gradually increased levels of p-AMPK (Fig. 3A) whereas
the cellular levels of p-mTOR and its downstream targets
p-p70S6K and p-4E-BP1, key enzymes involved in
protein synthesis, decreased (Fig. 3B). It seems that ATA
inactivates mTOR via concomitant activation of AMPK
and inhibition of Akt, thereby causing cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis.

ATA induced activation of AMPK and altered
the expression levels of key enzymes involved in
lipid and protein biosyntheses
Recent studies reported that inhibition of fatty acid
synthesis can suppress tumor cell growth and induce
apoptosis [15, 17, 18, 21, 37–42]. This inhibition can be

ATA triggered ER and oxidative stresses in
HER2-positive breast cancer cells

intracellular ROS levels in the presence and absence of
ATA. We found that ATA caused an early and slight, but
statistically significant, increase in ROS accumulation
(Fig. 4B). Furthermore, FACS analysis using JC-1
dye indicated a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the
percentage of cells with depolarized mitochondria in
ATA-treated cells compared to DMSO-treated control
(Fig. 4C). Additionally, ATA notably increased the levels
of proapoptotic protein Bax and concomitantly decreased
the expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
(Fig. 4D).
To determine whether increased production of
ROS may have a role in ATA-induced apoptosis, loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), or cell cycle
arrest; HER2-positive breast cancer cells were pretreated
with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) two
hours before adding ATA for a further 48 h. As shown in
Fig. 4E and 4F, pretreatment with NAC conferred
significant protection against ATA-induced apoptosis and
loss of MMP. However, the same treatment did not prevent
cell cycle arrest (data not shown). Together, these data
indicate that ROS generation may be one of the important
events in the ATA-activated apoptotic signaling cascade.

In eukaryotic cells, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is
an important player in regulating protein synthesis and
lipid metabolism [43]. Perturbation of ER homeostasis
is known as ER stress [44]. To assess whether ATA can
cause ER stress in MDA-MB-453 and SK-BR-3 cells, we
examined by Western blot analysis the phosphorylation
status of the ER stress sensor, PERK. We found that ATA
induced phosphorylation/activation of PERK which, in
turn, phosphorylated/activated the translation initiation
factor eIF2α (Fig. 4A). Transcription factor ATF4, a
downstream signal of PERK-eIF2α pathway, was also
found to be up-regulated. In addition, expression of
CHOP, a hallmark of ER stress-mediated cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis [45], was increased (Fig. 4A). Coupled
with the phosphorylation of PERK, increases in steadystate levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins ATF-4 and CHOP
with simultaneous decrease in general protein synthesis
strongly indicate that the induction of ER stress might be
involved in ATA-mediated cell death in HER2-positive
breast cancer cells.
Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
the cytoplasm has been shown to trigger ER stress and
the unfolded protein response [46] leading to CHOP
expression [47], cleavage of PARP, and apoptosis [48].

therapeutic potential of ATA. We found that 35 mg/kg
of ATA administered three times per week significantly
reduced tumor volume (Fig. 5B) and tumor weight (Fig. 5C)
but had no effect on mice body weight (Fig. 5A). In this
tumor inhibition model, the average tumor volume in the
negative control group increased from 95.79 ± 12.02 mm3 to
285.27 ± 25.24 mm3 at the end of the experiment, whereas
the average tumor volume in the ATA-treated group

decreased from 99.55 ± 11.13 mm3 to 46.49 ± 10.20 mm3.
Tumor regression occurred in ATA-treated group by day
14 (~2%) after starting treatment and reached ~50% on
day 33 (end-point of the experiment). Additionally, the
average tumor weight in the negative control group was
96.33 ± 13.67 mg, whereas the average tumor weight in
the ATA-treated group was only 26.5 ± 9.42 mg (Fig. 5C)
suggesting that ATA strongly inhibited tumor growth in vivo.

expression of VEGFR2 in HUVECs. Cumulatively,
these data suggest that ATA may inhibit angiogenesis
in vitro.

It is a well-known fact that cell migration and
invasion plays a crucial role in tumor metastasis. In the
present study, wound-closure and transwell migration
assays were employed to assess the effects of ATA on the
motility of HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Results
shown in Fig. 6A and 6B indicate an apparent antimobility
effect of ATA as illustrated with MDA-MB-453 and
SK-BR-3 cells compared to their respective negative
controls.
We further investigated the effect of ATA on the
proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation of
human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs).
As depicted in Fig. 6C, ATA resulted in a dramatic
inhibition of HUVE cell proliferation. Capillary-like
tube formation assay indicates that ATA exposure
markedly and dose-dependently suppressed the
formation of functional tube-like networks (Fig. 6D).
Furthermore, ATA inhibited the chemotactic motility and
invasion of HUVECs as revealed by wound-healing and
transwell techniques (data not shown). To investigate the
molecular mechanism underlying this anti-angiogenic
effect, we evaluated the cellular levels of vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) by
Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 6E, ATA timeand dose-dependently down-regulated the protein

DISCUSSION

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The development of innovative ways to prevent
and/or to treat resistant subtypes of breast cancer
is being actively explored in cancer chemotherapy.
We focused our investigation on acetyltanshinone
IIA (ATA) which is described as a promising cytotoxic
agent from herbal origin with potent in vitro and in vivo
anticancer properties [36]. We explored for the first
time the molecular mechanisms by which ATA inhibits
angiogenesis, metastasis, and induces cell death in HER2overexpressing breast cancer cells. We further examined
the intricate relationship between ATA-induced apoptosis
and inhibition of key metabolic enzymes involved in lipid
and protein biogenesis.
Data reported here show that ATA inhibited doseand time-dependently the proliferation of HER2-positive
MDA-MB-453, SK-BR-3, and BT-474 cell lines. More
importantly, when we investigated whether ATA has a
selective activity on cancer cells, we found that its action
is relatively less potent on MCF-10A, a non-tumorigenic
breast cell line (Table 1). These results enhance the
desirability of ATA as an anticancer agent because they
suggest that it selectively kills breast cancer cells while
minimizing damage to normal breast tissue.

E. Representative Western blot analysis of VEGFR-2 expressed in HUVECs treated with ATA. GAPDH was used as loading control.

FACS and Western blot analyses revealed that the
anticancer activity of ATA is associated with cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis. Perturbations of cell cycle were
mainly found in the increase of G1 and S phases cell
populations. Further investigations on the status of key
factors known to regulate cell cycle progression indicated
that treatment with ATA promoted the levels of cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21 and down-regulated the
protein expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin A, cdk2, cdk4,
and cdk6. This action prevented cyclin D/cdk4/cdk6 and
cyclin A/cdk2 complexes from phosphorylating Rb protein
at different serine positions thereby arresting cell growth.
Moreover, observations that ATA induced S phase arrest
in MDA-MB-453 and G1 and S phases arrest in SK-BR-3
and BT-474 depending on the dose used for treatment
suggest that ATA-mediated growth inhibition may be cell
specific.
Cancers overexpressing receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) EGFR and/or HER2, particularly breast
cancers [49], are known to be resistant to established
chemotherapy [50]. Thus, dual kinase inhibition directed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

against EGFR and HER2 was and still is an attractive
potential approach for breast cancer therapy. Our data
showed a decrease in the phosphorylation/activation
status of HER2 and EGFR oncoproteins following ATA
exposure which consecutively inhibited the activation of
downstream pro-survival growth pathways.
The survival of breast cancer cells with HER2 gene
amplification has been reported to be heavily dependent on
lipid metabolism [51]. Several studies reported a crosstalk
between FASN and HER2 oncoprotein [52–55]. Indeed,
HER2 overexpression was found to increase translation of
FASN [12, 56], whereas FASN overexpression was found
to markedly increase EGFR and HER2 signalings [25].
Furthermore, tumor cells are well-characterized by
their rapid cell growth which requires active synthesis
of proteins, ribosomal RNA, and lipids. As all of these
functions are switched off by AMPK [57, 58], tumor cells
developed mechanisms to down-regulate AMPK and
thus escape from its restraining influences on growth and
biosynthesis. Herein, we have shown that treatment with
ATA induced phosphorylation/activation of AMPK and
21872

that this effect translated to downstream targets such as
phosphorylation/inhibition of ACC, down-regulation of
FASN and p-ACLY, and inhibition of mTOR/4EB-P1/
p70S6K signaling pathway. Interestingly, we found
that ATA triggered ER and oxidative stresses, induced
loss of MMP, and altered protein expression of Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, and Bax in HER2-positive breast cancer cells.
More important, employing the powerful antioxidant
NAC [59], we demonstrated that ROS play a critical role
in ATA-induced apoptosis and loss of MMP.
Overexpression of HER2 in human tumor cells
is closely associated with increased angiogenesis
and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) [60]. Proliferation, migration, and tube formation
of endothelial cells represent the three primary steps
of angiogenesis [61] and play a central role in tumor
growth, metastasis, and survival. In the present study,
we provided evidence that ATA significantly and dosedependently inhibits the mobility of HER2-positive
breast cancer cells. We further showed that endothelial
cells (HUVECs) proliferation, migration, invasion, and
tubule formation are markedly disrupted following ATA
exposure. Consistent with these results, VEGFR2 protein
expression was found to be down-regulated (Fig. 6E).
As VEGFR2 is the main receptor involved in endothelial
cell survival, proliferation, and vascular permeability;
VEGFR2 suppression may represent a critical mechanism
by which ATA mediates its anti-angiogenic effects.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
demonstrating the detailed molecular mechanism of ATA
on HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Altogether
our findings described the ability of ATA to perturb four
major cellular signaling and metabolic pathways: HER2/
EGFR, ROS/ER stress, proteins and lipids biogenesis.
On the basis of these promising results, the present study
suggests that ATA is a potential option for the treatment of
patients with HER2-driven breast cancer.

(MCF-10A) were used in this study. Cells were
obtained from the Cell Bank of Shanghai Institute of
Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai,
China) and were grown as monolayers in the following
media: RPMI 1640 (BT-474 and MCF-10A); DMEM
(SK-BR-3); and Leibovitz’s (MDA-MB-453). All media
were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1% (v/v) antibiotics. Cells were maintained at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2
and 95% air except MDA-MB-453 cells which were
maintained in an atmosphere without CO2.

Cell viability assay
The effect of ATA on cell viability was determined
by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Briefly,
exponentially growing cells were plated at appropriate
seeding density in 96-well plates and allowed to attach
overnight. Next day, cells were treated with media
containing DMSO alone as control or with ATA (1 μM,
2.5 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM) for 12, 24, 48, and
72 h. Cell viability was determined at the end of each timeperiod using CCK-8 reagent. Absorbance was measured
at 450 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs and reagents
ATA (MW 380 g/mol) was provided by China
Pharmaceutical University Research Institute of
Pharmaceutical Chemistry. It was obtained as a white
powder of high purity (> 97%). Stock solutions of 10 mM
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, SigmaAldrich), stored at − 20°C, and diluted in fresh medium
just before use. Lapatinib (MW 925.3 g/mol) was obtained
from Jiangsu Kanion Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (China).
Drugs dilutions were made in serum-free media with
a final DMSO concentration less than 0.1%. Media and
reagents for cell culture were acquired from Thermo
Scientific HyClone (Beijing, China). N-acetyl-L-cysteine
(NAC) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (China).
Antibodies employed in this study were obtained from
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Flow cytometry
To examine the mitochondrial membrane potential
(MMP) after ATA-treatment, JC-1 (5, 5′, 6, 6′-tetrachloro-1,
1′, 3, 3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide)
dye was used [62] according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For apoptosis detection, Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences Pharmingen)
was employed following the manufacturer’s protocol.
For cell cycle analysis, treated and untreated cells were
washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed
overnight in ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol, and stained
with a staining buffer containing RNase and propidium
iodide (PI). Data acquisition was done by flow cytometry

fields were captured with an Olympus IX71 microscope.
All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Immunoblotting

Capillary-like tube formation (HUVEC) assay

Following ATA exposure, whole-cell lysates
were isolated using KeyGEN Total Protein Extraction
Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein
concentrations were determined by the BCA method
and protein extracts were stored at -80°C until use.
For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of proteins
were electrophoresed on sodium dodecylsulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm,
Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) by
electroblotting. Proteins were then detected with
specific antibodies. For each test, an anti-β-actin or
anti-GAPDH antibody was used as loading control.
Protein signals on nitrocellulose membranes were
assessed with ChemiDoc XRS imaging densitometer
(Bio-Rad) using Quantity One software program
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA).

Growth factor-depleted Matrigel from BD
Pharmingen (San Jose, CA, USA) was applied to a 96well tissue culture plate (50 μl per well) [64]. Following
polymerization, human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells per
well (final volume 180 μL) on the polymerized Matrigel
in the presence or absence of ATA (1 μM, 5 μM, and
15 μM). Plate was incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 6 h.
Photographs of five random fields were taken under an
inverted microscope and tube formation was quantified
using Adobe Photoshop software. The inhibition of tube
formation was expressed relative to untreated control
wells which were set at 100%.

In vivo study
5–6 weeks old female BALB/c nude mice weighing
~20 g each were purchased from Shanghai Rubicam
Laboratory Animal Ltd (Shanghai, China) and housed in
a controlled environment at 22°C with a 12 h light/dark
cycle. MDA-MB-453 cells with ~92% viability were
subcutaneously injected into the right flank of each mouse
(2 × 107 per mouse). After tumors grew to ~90 mm3,
mice were randomly selected (6 mice/group) for the
intraperitoneal administration of either ATA at a dose of
35 mg/kg or vehicle three times per week. The positive
control group was treated by gastric gavage with lapatinib
(80 mg/kg) twice daily. The body weight of each mouse
was recorded three times a week (Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday). At the same time, solid tumor volume
(in cubic millimeters) was determined using digital Vernier
caliper measurements and the formula of a × b2 × 0.5,
where a is the longest diameter of the tumor and b is the
shortest diameter of the tumor. At the end of the treatment
period, mice were sacrificed and tumors were excised.
All animal procedures were approved by the Animal
Ethics Committee of China Pharmaceutical University,
Nanjing University, and Laboratory Animal Management
Committee of Jiangsu Province.

Measurement of ROS production
The intracellular ROS levels were determined
spectroflurometrically using the membrane-permeable
fluorescent probe 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA, Beyotime). Briefly, cells (2.5 × 104
per well) were seeded in 96-well black wall/clear bottom
microplates. After allowing cells to attach overnight,
100 μL of DCFH-DA staining solution (5 μM) was
added to each well and cells were incubated in the dark
at 37°C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation time, cells
were washed twice with serum-free media and 100 μL of
ATA dilutions (5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM) were added to
each well (six wells per concentration). Background wells
(untreated or ATA treated cells) as well as blank wells
(media only) were included in each test. Fluorescence
signal was then monitored time-dependently using a
fluorescent plate reader (Tecan Austria Gmbh) with
Magellan software. Blank readings were subtracted
from all measurements and relative ROS production was
expressed as fold change in fluorescence compared with
the fluorescence of the corresponding control.

Statistical analysis

Transwell migration and wound healing assays

Student’s two-tailed t test was used to determine the
statistical significance of difference in the measured variables
between control and treated groups. For all analyses, a
p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Transwell motility assays were performed as
previously described [63] with minor modifications.
The chemoattractant used for these tests was complete
media. Assays were performed using 8-μm transwell
inserts (Millipore). Migrated cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with Crystal Violet. For
wound healing tests, confluent monolayers of cells
were scratched with a micro pipette tip. All assays were
monitored over a 48 h-period. Pictures of five random
