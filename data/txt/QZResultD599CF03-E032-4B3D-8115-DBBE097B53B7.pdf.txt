BACKGROUND: Sunitinib has replaced interferon (IFN) as a first-line standard of care in the treatment of
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study aimed to determine overall survival and to confirm effectiveness in a population that includes poor prognosis patients. METHODS: Data were collected on all
patients identified by the BC Cancer Registry with metastatic RCC who were treated with IFN or sunitinib.
The IFN group consisted of patients who received IFN between January 2000 and October 2005, and the
sunitinib group included patients treated with first-line sunitinib from October 2005 to September 2007.
RESULTS: There were 131 and 69 patients in the IFN and sunitinib groups, respectively. The median followup of those still alive was 12.6 months. The median age (62 vs 63 years; P ¼ .41), Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic criteria (poor in 19% vs 30%; P ¼ .41), and proportion with >1 metastasis
(53% vs 62%; P ¼ .21) were similar between the IFN and sunitinib groups, respectively. The median survival
of the IFN and sunitinib groups was 8.7 and 17.3 months, respectively (log-rank P ¼ .004). The median survival of patients with favorable, intermediate, and poor MSKCC prognostic profiles in the IFN group was
22.9, 8.7, and 4.1 months, respectively (P < .001), whereas in the sunitinib group it was not reached, 16.8,
and 10.7 months, respectively (P ¼ .006). The hazard ratio of death after adjusting for MSKCC criteria was
0.49 (95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.76; P ¼ .001). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of first-line sunitinib
was associated with a doubling of overall survival compared with patients treated with IFN alone. This benC 2009 American

been elucidated, agents targeting relevant biologic pathways have been investigated.7 Antiangiogenic agents are
rapidly changing the therapeutic landscape in metastatic
RCC. Sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab in combination
with IFN, temsirolimus, and everolimus have thus far
demonstrated significant activity within randomized
phase 3 trials.8-10,18,21
Sunitinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor types 1, 2, 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors
alpha and beta, c-kit, and FLT-3. In the landmark phase 3
trial examining treatment-naive patients with metastatic
RCC, there was a statistically significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with sunitinib versus IFN (11 vs 5 months), with a hazard ratio of 0.42
(P < .001).8 These results served as the basis for introducing
sunitinib as a reference first-line standard of care.
When a significant PFS benefit in an interim analysis of the pivotal phase 3 sunitinib trial8 was detected,
patients randomized to IFN were allowed to cross over to
sunitinib at progression or be treated with other antiVEGF therapy. Overall survival data for sunitinib was
presented recently showing an impressive difference in
survival compared with IFN (26.4 vs 21.8 months) but
with a log-rank P value of .051 (Wilcoxon P value
.0128).13 A post hoc analysis indicated that the true overall survival difference between sunitinib- and IFN-treated
groups was diluted because a substantial number of
patients in the standard IFN treatment arm received either
sunitinib or another anti-VEGF targeted therapy after
progression. Other phase 3 trials comparing targeted
therapies such as sorafenib and bevacizumab with IFN
have not yet demonstrated an overall survival benefit for
potentially the same reason, despite impressive differences
in PFS.9,10
It is important to note that only 6% to 7% of
patients enrolled in the randomized phase 3 sunitinib trial
had poor Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC) prognostic profiles. This reflects the eligibility
criteria and selection bias in randomized controlled trials,
in that patients enrolled in prospective trials are relatively
healthier and may have better outcomes than patients in
the general population.14
The question of generalizability of the initially
reported results with a PFS benefit only8 and the high
drug costs led to extensive discussions between experts
Cancer

and funding institutions about the true survival benefit of
these drugs and the value of sunitinib in a general patient
population including poor prognosis patients. This has
become a major obstacle for obtaining funding for these
expensive drugs from healthcare insurers or funding institutions in various countries around the world.
This population-based retrospective analysis aims to
provide important information about the impact of a new
treatment strategy on the outcomes of RCC in British Columbia. It examines the effect of sunitinib on overall survival when used in the general, unselected population,
reflecting ‘‘real world’’ clinical practices. All patients in the
province of British Columbia’s population of 4.3 million
people are reflected in this analysis, including patients
treated at academic and community oncology centers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Background
The BC Cancer Agency coordinates all cancer care for the
entire province of British Columbia, Canada. This has
been previously described in other population-based studies performed at this institution.15 Most patients receive
care from a medical oncologist at 1 of the 4 major cancer
treatment centers: the Vancouver Cancer Center, Vancouver Island Cancer Center, Fraser Valley Cancer Center, and Cancer Center for the Southern Interior. The
remaining patients receive care from local community
oncologists throughout the province. The BC Cancer
Registry records all new cases of cancer diagnosed in the
province of British Columbia. Pathologists are legally
required to report all new cancer cases to the registry. This
registry allows independent verification of all cancers seen
in the province, including RCC. The BC Cancer Agency
Provincial Pharmacy Database maintains electronic
records of all drugs dispensed. The Registry and Pharmacy
database can be linked electronically to match patient diagnosis, treatment, and outcome data.

Study Design
This is a population-based retrospective analysis examining outcomes for all patients with metastatic RCC in British Columbia, Canada during a 7-year interval: January
2000 to September 2007. This represents a 5-year period
777

Original Article

before (presunitinib) and 2-year period after (postsunitinib) the institution of a new standard treatment for
patients with RCC. A provincial policy switched standard
therapy for metastatic RCC from IFN to sunitinib in October 2005, when sunitinib became available for patients
in the province of British Columbia. This study was
approved by the British Columbia Cancer Agency
Research Ethics Board.
Patient Identification
The BC Cancer Registry was cross-referenced with the
Provincial Pharmacy Database to identify all patients with
metastatic RCC who were treated with IFN and/or sunitinib in the province of British Columbia between January
2000 and September 2007. The IFN group consisted of
all patients who received IFN alone between January
2000 and October 2005. The sunitinib group included all
patients treated with first-line sunitinib from October
2005 to September 2007, when sunitinib became available as standard therapy.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Patients included in this study had biopsy-proven renal
cell cancer with evidence of metastases. Patients who were
too frail or unsuitable for treatment were not included in
this analysis. Patients who received first-line IFN followed
by second-line sunitinib were excluded to preserve the validity of strictly comparing the IFN and sunitinib groups.
Treatment
Before October 2005, patients with metastatic RCC were
treated with IFN 9,000,000 international units (IU) 3
times per week on nonconsecutive days. After October
2005, patients were treated with sunitinib at a starting
dose of 50 mg daily for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week
break each cycle. Doses were adjusted according to toxicity, with dose reductions to 37.5 mg and then 25 mg if
needed. These treatment regimens are virtually the same
regimens for IFN and sunitinib as used in the pivotal
randomized phase 3 trial.8
Treatment of metastatic RCC has been uniform
across British Columbia. All physicians are expected to
follow the BC Cancer Agency treatment guidelines, which
are explicit documents outlining recommended therapy
with drug dosages, management of treatment complica778

tions, and follow-up recommendations. The aim of these
guidelines is to promote a uniform standard of care
according to current evidence-based medicine. Changes
in treatment policy are decided by a multidisciplinary tumor group and are communicated directly to all physicians that treat patients with kidney cancer via immediate
e-mail notification and by updating the web-based cancer
management guidelines of the BC Cancer Agency (http://
www.bccancer.bc.ca/HPI/CancerManagementGuidelines/default.htm).
Data Collection and Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics including those that have previously been shown to be prognostic (Karnofsky performance status [KPS], number of sites of metastases, diagnosis
to treatment interval >1 year, baseline lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], hemoglobin, corrected calcium, neutrophil count, platelet count)16,17 were collected. A subgroup
analysis according to MSKCC prognostic profiles (1
point each for diagnosis to treatment interval <1 year,
KPS <80, low hemoglobin, elevated serum calcium, elevated LDH 1.5 times the upper limit of normal; 0 points
constituting the favorable prognosis group, 1 or 2 points
the intermediate prognosis group, and 3 or more points
the poor prognosis group17) was performed. Overall survival was calculated from date of first-line treatment initiation (either IFN or sunitinib) until the date of death or
last follow-up.
Statistical analysis was performed to compare clinical characteristics and differences in overall survival in
first-line IFN versus first-line sunitinib patients. Twosample t test for continuous variables and chi-square tests
for categoric variables were used. For the known prognostic factors, P values were calculated to determine whether
the 2 treatment groups were equally balanced to better
elucidate the treatment effect. A multivariate analysis was
performed using a Cox proportional hazards model to
assess the independent effect of treatment on overall survival after controlling for relevant prognostic covariates.
Data were analyzed using SAS 9.1 statistical software
(Cary, NC).

Database. A total of 131 patients were treated with IFN
first-line, and 69 patients were treated with sunitinib firstline. The number of patients dead at the time of analysis
was 144 (72%). The median follow-up for all patients
treated with IFN was 8.4 months (range, 0.9-88.6), and
9.9 months (range, 1.9-33.4) for those treated with sunitinib. The median follow-up for patients still alive at the
time of analysis was 12.6 months.
The median age (62 vs 63 years; P ¼ .41) and proportion of patients with >1 metastasis (53% vs 62%; P ¼
.21) were similar between the IFN and sunitinib groups,
respectively (Table 1). The MSKCC prognostic profiles
distributed between the IFN and sunitinib groups were
not statistically different (P ¼ .41), although there was a
greater percentage of patients with poor MSKCC prognostic profiles in the sunitinib-treated group. The vast
majority of patients had clear cell histology.
The median survival of patients treated with IFN
versus sunitinib was 8.7 and 17.3 months, respectively
(log-rank P ¼ .004) (Fig. 1). The 1-year overall survival
rate for the IFN- and sunitinib-treated groups was 38.7%
and 59.9%, respectively. When adjusted for MSKCC
prognosis profile, the hazard ratio of death for those
patients treated with sunitinib versus IFN was 0.49 (95%
confidence interval, 0.31-0.76; P ¼ .001).
When examining patients with favorable, intermediate, and poor MSKCC prognostic categories, the median
survival of patients receiving IFN was 22.9, 8.7, and 4.1

months, respectively (P < .001), whereas in patients
receiving sunitinib it was not reached (NR), 16.8, and
10.7 months, respectively (P ¼ .006).
In subgroup analyses of patients in different
MSKCC prognostic profiles, there was a statistically significant difference in overall survival between the IFNand sunitinib-treated groups in patients with either intermediate (median 8.7 vs 16.8 months; log-rank P ¼
.0487) or poor (median 4.1 vs 10.7 months; log-rank P ¼
.0329) prognostic profiles. Because of small patient numbers and extended survival, no difference in overall survival in the favorable prognostic subgroup was detected
(median 22.9 months vs NR; log-rank P ¼ .0589). A significant difference may be detected in this subgroup with
further follow-up.

DISCUSSION
The treatment of metastatic RCC has been revolutionized
by VEGF-targeted therapy. Figlin et al13 recently reported
the final results of the pivotal randomized phase 3 study
comparing IFN with sunitinib. With a median survival of
more than 2 years in this trial, sunitinib has now been
widely accepted as a standard of care for first-line therapy
for patients with metastatic RCC.
Our current study is a population-based analysis
designed to evaluate the impact of the introduction of this
combination therapy across the general population of

patients with metastatic RCC. As many of these costly
new therapies emerge, it will become increasingly important to demonstrate their effectiveness and generalizability
in the general population to justify societal costs. These
issues are major obstacles for many government bodies in
Canada and some European countries to provide funding
for these drugs.18,19 It is therefore of utmost importance
to clarify the impact of sunitinib on overall survival in an
unselected, ‘‘real world’’ population of RCC patients.
Our population-based study confirms the profound
impact of the introduction of sunitinib on overall survival
when administered to an unselected population of
patients with metastatic RCC in routine clinical practice.
Patients treated in the sunitinib era had a median survival
of 17.3 months compared with 8.7 months in the IFN era
(log-rank P ¼ .004). This is an important verification
that the randomized controlled trial data can be extended
to a general population of patients, including many who
did not participate in clinical trials. Very similar results
have recently been reported by another Canadian
province.20,21
780

Importantly, this survival benefit was extended to
the subset of patients with poor MSKCC prognostic profiles17 (4.1 vs 10.7 months; P ¼ .0329). In comparison, in
the phase 3 trial of sunitinib versus IFN, the subgroup
with poor MSKCC prognostic profiles had a trend toward
benefit in PFS, but the confidence intervals crossed, likely
because of limited patient numbers.8 The only phase 3
clinical trial to study patients with poor prognostic criteria
compared IFN, temsirolimus, and both combined.11 The
median overall survival of patients treated with IFN versus
temsirolimus was 7.3 and 10.9 months, respectively (hazard ratio 0.73; P ¼ .008). These overall survival times are
very similar to those demonstrated in our poor prognosis
subset of patients treated with sunitinib versus IFN. In the
expanded access study of sunitinib,22,23 9.8% of patients
had MSKCC poor risk criteria, and 13.2% had an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group score >1. First-line
sunitinib patients had a median PFS of 8.9 months, which
is 2 months less than the PFS of the aforementioned phase
3 trial. Again, it is demonstrated that patient survival outside of a clinical trial could potentially be decreased by the

inclusion of real-world patients who may have poorer risk
profiles. Overall survival results are pending for the
expanded access study, which would then enable us to
directly compare our data.
The strength of these data are that they are population-based and reflect ‘‘real-world’’ practice. The population was derived from databases that capture all patients
with a diagnosis of RCC and their treatment in a province
with uniform treatment guidelines that are strictly
adhered to for reimbursement purposes. This allows data
collection to be consistent in the electronic medical
records and ensures a level of standardized care between
sunitinib- and IFN-treated groups.
The analysis of clinical factors demonstrated no statistically significant differences between the 2 patient
groups, although there were slightly more patients in the
sunitinib-treated group with poor MSKCC prognostic
profiles, >1 site of metastasis, anemia, and hypercalcemia.
All of these factors may have slightly biased the results
against sunitinib in terms of overall survival.
The IFN regimen used in British Columbia was
considered a standard regimen at the time and was
virtually the same regimen used in the randomized phase
3 study. It is important to note that the overall survival
observed in both our IFN and sunitinib groups was
somewhat inferior to those in previously reported clinical
trials, ranging from 13 to 14 months2-5 and from 23.9 to
26.4 months,13,24 respectively. The patients in the
randomized trials are generally well selected, with good
performance status compared with the patients in this
study. Compared with the patients in the pivotal phase 3
trial,8 the patients of our study were slightly older (62 vs
60 years), had substantially fewer nephrectomies (68% vs
90%), and had more poor risk patients (23% vs 6% poor
risk patients), all of which may lead to poorer outcome.
Compared with the MSKCC database of immunotherapy
patients composed of patients enrolled in clinical trials,17
the patients of our population-based study were slightly
older (62 vs 59 years) with worse performance status (median KPS 70 vs 90), which again may lead to poorer
outcome.
In addition, almost 60% of patients in the phase 3
trial13 had active second-line treatment, which would
likely increase their overall survival compared with
patients in our study. Our IFN group received no active
second-line therapy (4 patients on non-VEGF phase 1 triCancer

February 15, 2009

als, 1 vinblastine, and 1 capecitabine). IFN patients who
received second-line targeted therapy were excluded from
the primary analysis and are discussed below. In our sunitinib group, <10% of patients had active second-line
therapy (3 sorafenib, 2 temsirolimus). Although data collection was very complete through pharmacy registries, we
cannot entirely exclude the possibility of missing data.
The major limitations of this study include the retrospective nature, the inability to perform a central pathology review, and the relatively modest cohort of
patients collected over an extended period of time. However, the population of British Columbia was relatively
stable over this period, which allowed the reliable tracking
of clinical outcomes. In addition, data collection was very
complete, with data available in >99% of patients. Of the
possible 7000 data points collected, only 62 were missing
(0.88%).
Technological advances in imaging or changes in
surgical or supportive care over the years may have
affected the results of this analysis. However, there were
no obvious dramatic changes in the treatment of metastatic RCC in British Columbia in the last decade other
than the introduction of targeted therapy. Furthermore,
patients in the sunitinib group did not receive treatment
earlier than patients in the IFN group, which would otherwise have artificially created an overall survival difference similar to the concept of lead-time bias in screening
studies. Specifically, the median time from diagnosis of
metastatic disease to treatment was 1.9 months in the IFN
group and 2.6 months in the sunitinib group (log-rank P
¼ .66).
When targeted therapy was first introduced, there
was a transition period where 30 patients were treated
with first-line IFN followed by second-line sunitinib and
were subsequently excluded in this analysis as documented in the Materials and Methods section. This was
because these patients would contaminate the direct
comparison between IFN and sunitinib and may unfairly
bias the data toward the IFN group. Of note, if these
30 patients were combined with the 131 IFN-only
patients for a pure intention-to-treat analysis on first-line
therapy, median overall survival between first-line IFN
and first-line sunitinib treated groups would be 10.4
versus 17.3 months, respectively (IFN n ¼ 161, sunitinib
n ¼ 69; log-rank P ¼ .03), which is still clinically and statistically significant.

Finally, known prognostic factor profiles have been
developed for patients with metastatic RCC including the
commonly used, validated MSKCC criteria.17,25 This
study demonstrates that the MSKCC criteria were also
able to discriminate between the 3 prognostic categories
in both patients treated with IFN and those treated with
sunitinib.

Conclusions
The introduction of sunitinib as standard first-line treatment for metastatic RCC has resulted in a substantial
improvement in overall survival compared with patients
treated with IFN alone in this retrospective analysis. This
survival benefit extended into the subgroup of patients
with poor MSKCC prognostic profiles. This study confirms the effectiveness of sunitinib in the general, unselected population of patients with metastatic RCC.
