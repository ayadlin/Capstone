ABSTRACT
Cancer cells initially characterized as sensitive to chemotherapy may acquire
resistance to chemotherapy and lead to tumor recurrence through the expansion of
drug-resistant population. Acquisition of drug resistance to conventional chemotherapy
is a major obstacle in the treatment of recurrent cancer. Here we investigated whether
anticancer drugs induced Oct4 expression, thereby contributing to acquired drug
resistance and tumor recurrence in bladder cancer. We identified a positive correlation
of Oct4 expression with tumor recurrence in 122 clinical specimens of superficial
high-grade (stages T1-2) bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Increased Oct4
levels in bladder tumors were associated with short recurrence-free intervals in the
patients. Chemotherapy induced Oct4 expression in bladder cancer cells. Notably,
treatment with cisplatin increased CD44-positive bladder cancer cells expressing
Oct4, representing cancer stem-like cell subpopulation. Forced expression of Oct4
reduced, whereas knockdown of Oct4 enhanced, drug sensitivity in bladder cancer
cells. Furthermore, tumor cells overexpressing Oct4 responded poorly to cisplatin in
vivo. In regard to clinical relevance, inhibition of Oct4 by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
synergistically increased sensitivity to cisplatin in bladder cancer cells. Furthermore,
the combination of cisplatin and ATRA was superior to cisplatin alone in suppressing
tumor growth. Therefore, our results provide evidence that Oct4 increases drug
resistance and implicate that inhibition of Oct4 may be a therapeutic strategy to
circumvent drug resistance.

for cancer treatment. However, tumors can recur and
develop chemoresistance [1]. Solid tumors possess a
rare population of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which have
similar characteristics to normal stem cells and exhibit
self-renewal, asymmetric cell division, and resistance to
toxic agents [2]. CSCs display surface markers, including
CD44 and CD133, in various cancer types [3]. CD44 and
CD133 have been identified as surface biomarkers for
cancer cells resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs [4–6].
CSC-like cells are enriched following short-term single
treatment of chemotherapy, suggesting that malignant cells
may also be enriched by cisplatin treatment [6].
Oct4, a member of POU homeobox gene family, is
a transcription factor capable of binding to an octameric
consensus sequence to activate its target genes [7]. It
functions in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal of
embryonic stem (ES) cells [8]. Oct4 is highly expressed
in lung cancer-derived CD133- and CD44-positive cells,
anticancer drug-selected breast cancer cells, and side
population (SP) cells from bladder and ovarian cancer
cells with characteristics of CSCs [9–13], which exhibit
enhanced resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, such as
cisplatin. We have previously shown that Oct4 is detected
and predicts tumor progression and metastasis in bladder
cancer [14]. Moreover, we have also demonstrated that
Oct4-regulated oncolytic adenovirus can kill CD44- and
CD133-positive bladder cancer cells [15]. Expression of
Oct4 in CSC-like cell population not only promotes cell
growth, but also resists chemotherapy [16], suggesting a
role for Oct4 in regulating drug resistance.
Bladder carcinoma is the most common urothelial
malignancy in more developed countries [17]. Transitional
cell carcinoma (TCC) is the most common bladder
tumor and ~90% of bladder TCC are superficial at initial
diagnosis. Although primary tumors can be eliminated by
surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, the tumors recur
frequently and may progress to muscle-invasive disease
[18]. The acquisition of drug resistance in recurrent tumors
is a critical factor that limits successful cancer treatment.
Resistance to common chemotherapeutic agents involves
multiple mechanisms, which can be intrinsic or acquired
during treatment [19]. Since acquired drug resistance is an
important contributor to the recurrence and progression
of bladder cancer, elucidating its underlying mechanisms
may provide novel therapeutic strategies for bladder
cancer.
In the present study, we investigated whether
anticancer drugs induced Oct4 expression, thereby
contributing to acquired drug resistance and tumor
recurrence in bladder cancer. Our results show that
expression of Oct4 was positively correlated with tumor
recurrence in clinical specimens of bladder cancer. Our in
vitro and in vivo studies also demonstrate that induction
of Oct4 expression after treatment with anticancer
drugs rendered bladder cancer cells chemoresistant. In
conclusion, our results provide evidence that Oct4 can

induce drug-acquired chemoresistance in bladder cancer,
and implicate that inhibition of Oct4 may be further
explored as a therapeutic strategy to counteract acquired
drug resistance.

RESULTS
Expression levels of Oct4 are increased in
recurrent bladder cancer and positively
correlated with tumor recurrence
As expression of Oct4 is associated with tumor
progression and chemotherapy resistance, we first
examined the expression levels of Oct4 in 122 clinical
specimens of superficial high-grade (stages T1-2) bladder
TCC of 110 patients, among which 24 specimens were
paired primary and recurrent samples from 12 patients.
Figure 1A shows that the immunoreactive intensity for
Oct4 was individually scored as 0-3 and categorized as
low (0-1), moderate (2), or high (3) [14, 20]. Kaplan-Meier
analysis reveals that patients with Oct4 high-expressing
tumors (score 3) had significantly shorter recurrence-free
intervals (median = 13 months) than those with Oct4 lowexpressing tumors (score 0-2) (median = 34.5 months) (P
< 0.001) (Figure 1B). We further analyzed the expression
levels of Oct4 in 12 paired primary and recurrent tumor
specimens. Expression levels of Oct4 in recurrent
tumors were higher than those in their primary tumor
counterparts (Figure 1C). As shown in Figure 1D, much
higher percentages of tumors with high expression (score
3) of Oct4 and much lower percentages of tumors with
low expression (score 0-1) of Oct4 were noted in recurrent
tumors than in primary tumors (P < 0.001). We also used
quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to assess Oct4
expression in bladder tumor and normal tissue. Figure 1E
show that mRNA levels of Oct4 were significantly higher
in bladder tumor than in normal tissue. Taken together, we
identified a positive correlation of Oct4 expression with
bladder tumor recurrence.

Expression of Oct4 is increased in bladder
cancer cells following chemotherapeutic
treatment
We investigated whether Oct4 was involved in
acquired resistance induced by anticancer drugs. As shown
in Figure 2A, protein levels of Oct4 were dramatically
increased in TCCSUP, J82, and TSGH-8301 bladder
cancer cells after treatment with 1 μg/ml of cisplatin for
24 h. Figure 2B shows that TCCSUP cells expressed Oct4
upon cisplatin treatment in a dose-dependent manner.
Bladder cancer cells, including TCCSUP, J82, and T24
cells, expressed higher levels of Oct4 mRNA than SVHUC-1 normal human urothelial cells, as determined
by real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Figure 2C).

contribution of Oct4 to drug resistance in vivo, we treated
NOD/SCID mice bearing human TCCSUP-vector or
TCCSUP-Oct4 xenografts with cisplatin or saline. As
shown in Figure 4C, mice bearing TCCSUP-Oct4 tumors
had larger tumor volumes than those bearing TCCSUPvector tumors without cisplatin treatment (P = 0.0002).
Whereas treatment with cisplatin significantly retarded
tumor growth in mice bearing TCCSUP-vector tumors
(P < 0.0001), it had no effects on reducing tumor growth
in mice bearing TCCSUP-Oct4 tumors compared to
treatment with saline. These results indicate that Oct4overexpressing tumors responded poorly to cisplatin
treatment. At day 44 after tumor cell inoculation,
tumors were resected from the tumor-bearing mice for
immunohistochemical examination. As shown in Figure
4D, TCCSUP-vector tumors, in particular TCCSUPOct4 tumors, expressed higher levels of Oct4 following
cisplatin treatment compared with those without treatment.
Collectively, overexpression of Oct4 in cisplatin-treated
mice suggests that the mechanism underlying acquired
drug resistance may involve Oct4 overexpression.

The mRNA levels of Oct4 were increased in TCCSUP
cells treated with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and
doxorubicin, whereas treatment with mitomycin C or
paclitaxel (Taxol) had no such effects (Figure 2D).
Furthermore, Oct4 protein induced by cisplatin in different
bladder cancer cells was located in the nucleus (Figure
2E). Collectively, these results suggest that expression of
Oct4 was enhanced in bladder cancer cells that had been
exposed to various anticancer drugs.

CD44-positive cells expressing Oct4 are
increased in bladder cancer cells following
cisplatin treatment
Since Oct4 is considered a key maintainer of CSC
pluripotency, we next explored whether expression of Oct4
and CD44 was increased in bladder cancer cells following
cisplatin treatment. Immunofluorescence analysis show
that treatment with cisplatin enhanced the expression of
both CD44 and Oct4 in bladder cancer cells (Figure 3A),
Notably, CD44 was colocalized with Oct4, suggesting
concurrent upregulation of CD44 and Oct4 during cisplatin
treatment. Moreover, we compared the tumor growth of
NOD/SCID mice inoculated with parental TCCSUP cells
and that inoculated with cisplatin-resistant TCCSUP cells
following 5 doses of cisplatin treatment every other day
from day 5 after tumor cell inoculation. Figure 3B shows
that cisplatin-resistant TCCSUP tumors grew faster and
larger than the parental tumors (P < 0.001), indicating that
drug-resistant tumors progressed more rapidly than did
parental tumors, which may be attributed to the elevation
of Oct4 after chemotherapy. Expression of Oct4 in the
CD44-positive tumor cells could also be detected, albeit
in a small percentage, in the tissue slices of cisplatinresistant TCCSUP tumor xenografts after cisplatin
treatment (Figure 3C), suggesting a potential role for
Oct4 in the poor response of tumors to cisplatin treatment.
Colocalization between Oct4 and CD44 expression was
also observed in the clinical tumor specimens from two
patients with bladder cancer (Figure 3D). Taken together,
these results suggest that CD44-positive cancer cells
expressing Oct4 are induced by cisplatin, which may
contribute to drug resistance.

Knockdown of Oct4 expression enhances
sensitivity of bladder cancer cells to various
chemotherapeutic agents
To further verify the correlation of Oct4 expression
with drug resistance in bladder cancer cells, we generated
lentivirus-mediated stable Oct4-knockdown cells and
their control cells. In the Oct4-knockdown TCCSUP,
expression of Oct4 transcripts was suppressed to various
degrees in two different knockdown cells (Supplementary
Figure S1). Susceptibilities of Oct4-knockdown cells to
various chemotherapeutic agents were examined. Table 1
shows that except for mitomycin C, knockdown of Oct4
expression rendered TCCSUP cells more susceptible to the
chemotherapeutic agents tested, including cisplatin, 5-FU,
doxorubicin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and methotrexate.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that suppression
of Oct4 expression in bladder cancer cells results in
increased sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic agents.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) synergistically
enhances cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in
bladder cancer cells

Overexpression of Oct4 in bladder cancer
confers resistance to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo

ATRA, a powerful differentiating agent, can
suppress Oct4 gene expression because it can influence
multiple signaling pathways involved in stem cell
maintenance [21]. ATRA is transported into the nucleus
by binding to retinoid acid receptor α (RARα). Expression
of RARα was detected in TCCSUP, TSGH-8301,
and J82 cells, and no significant changes were found
after treatment with cisplatin (Figure 5A). We further
investigated the effect of ATRA on the expression of Oct4
and RARα in cisplatin-treated TCCSUP and J82 cells. As

We next investigated whether Oct4 contributed to
cisplatin-induced acquired drug resistance. We generated
Oct4-overexpressing and vector control TCCSUP cells
using lentivirus-mediated gene transfer (Figure 4A).
Overexpression of Oct4 resulted in a five-fold increase
in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of
cisplatin in Oct4-overexpressing TCCSUP cells (3.43
± 0.2 μM) compared to their control counterparts (0.67
± 0.086 μM) (P < 0.0001) (Figure 4B). To verify the

shown in Figure 5B, treatment with ATRA significantly
decreased the expression of Oct4 and RARα in TCCSUP
cells in the presence of cisplatin. However, such effects
were not evident in J82 cells. To further determine whether
treatment with ATRA in bladder cancer cells could
increase their sensitivity to cisplatin, we combined ATRA
with cisplatin to treat bladder cancer cells. The IC50 value
of cisplatin in TCCSUP cells was significantly lower in
ATRA-treated cells than in the vehicle (solvent)-treated
control cells (mean ± SEM, 1.31 ± 0.19 versus 1.91 ±
0.27 μM; P = 0.0319) (Figure 5C). We next evaluated
the combination effect of cisplatin and ATRA on the
cytotoxicity of TCCSUP cells using the coefficient of
drug interaction (CDI) [22–24]. The value of the CDI for
the combination of cisplatin (ranging from 0.5 to 10 μg/
ml) with ATRA (0.1 μM) was less than 1, indicative of a
synergistic effect (Figure 5D).

treatment with cisplatin plus solvent significantly retarded
tumor growth compared with saline treatment in TCCSUP
tumor-bearing mice (P = 0.0066), combination treatment
with cisplatin and ATRA was superior to single treatment
with cisplatin (P = 0.0047). Compared with saline-treated
group, higher levels of Oct4 in the tumors were detected in
mice receiving cisplatin alone or in combination with the
vehicle (solvent) (Figure 6D). By contrast, combination
treatment with cisplatin and ATRA abrogated cisplatininduced Oct4 expression. Therefore, these results suggest
that induction of Oct4 may be involved in the acquired
drug resistance induced by cisplatin. Furthermore,
ATRA, which inhibits Oct4 expression, may provide
potential therapeutic benefits toward the effectiveness of
chemotherapeutic agents for cancer therapy.

Combination treatment of cisplatin with ATRA
inhibits the growth of bladder tumor

Early detection of cancer has been improved in
recent years; however, the prognosis of patients with
some cancers especially those with late stage remains
poor, mostly due to development of drug resistance,
followed by tumor recurrence. In the present study, we
analyzed 122 clinical specimens of superficial highgrade bladder TCC of 110 patients for Oct4 expression
by immunohistochemistry. Patients with high expression
levels of Oct4 were associated with short recurrencefree intervals. Expression levels of Oct4 in recurrent
tumors were significantly higher than those in primary
tumors. We further investigated a potential role for
Oct4 in drug resistance of bladder cancer in vitro and
in mice. Treatment with various chemotherapeutic

DISCUSSION

We next evaluated the effects of cisplatin and ATRA
alone or in combination on the growth of bladder tumor
in vivo. We treated TCCSUP tumor-bearing mice with
ATRA, cisplatin, the vehicle (solvent), or saline alone
and monitored their tumor growth. Single treatment
with either cisplatin or ATRA significantly slowed tumor
growth compared to their control counterparts, with
cisplatin being more effective than ATRA (Figure 6A).
Nevertheless, mice treated with cisplatin expressed higher
levels of Oct4 compared with the remaining three groups
of mice (Figure 6B). As shown in Figure 6C, although

drugs increased Oct4 expression in bladder cancer cells.
Moreover, overexpression of Oct4 reduced, whereas
knockdown of Oct4 enhanced, sensitivity to anticancer
drugs. Collectively, our results indicate that Oct4
increases the resistance of bladder cancer against various
chemotherapeutic agents. However, the exact role of
Oct4 overexpression in drug resistance and its underlying
molecular mechanism have yet to be elucidated.
The unique capabilities of proliferation,
tumorigenesis, and chemoresistance of CSCs make
these cells an attractive therapeutic target and an ideal
candidate for developing strategies aiming at preventing
cancer recurrence. CD44 and CD133 are the most
common CSC markers and broadly expressed on cancer
cells [25–28]. Although there are various CSC markers,
such as CD133, CD44, and ALDH1, displayed on cancer
cells, Oct4 expression in these cells plays a major role
in anti-apoptosis and maintenance of pluripotency. In
the present study, we show that CD44-positive cells that

expressed Oct4 were dramatically increased in bladder
cancer cell lines after cisplatin treatment. Moreover,
colocalization of CD44 with Oct4 was detectable, albeit
in a small percentage of cells, in human bladder tumor
xenografts that were resistant to cisplatin treatment. Our
results suggest that bladder cancer cells undergo CSC-like
changes after exposure to cisplatin. Genetic instability
or environmental stimulation may result in genetic or
epigenetic changes, revealing the flexibility of cancer cells.
The chemotherapy-induced stemness phenotype of cancers
is acquired and maintained by Oct4 [29]. During cisplatin
treatment, activation of the Oct4 gene was attributed to
decreased promoter methylation [16]. Oct4 can enhance
survivin expression to promote cancer cell proliferation
[30] and is critical for survival/anti-apoptosis of murine
ES cells [31]. Our results show that the induction of
Oct4 enhances the acquisition of CSC phenotypes and
resistance to cisplatin in bladder cancer cells. In addition
to cisplatin, treatment of lung cancer cells with 5-FU,

doxorubicin, etoposide, and methotrexate has been shown
to enrich CSC-like cells with drug resistance [32].
Transcription factors are involved in the regulation
of stress-inducible genes. Oct1, which belongs to the same
POU homeobox gene family as Oct4, is induced after
cells are exposed to different DNA-damaging agents,
such as cisplatin [33]. Furthermore, different transcription
factors have been shown to play roles in the acquisition of
cellular resistance to cisplatin, such as NF-κB, YB-1, and
activating transcription factor 4 [34]. In the current study,
we demonstrate that treatment with cisplatin, 5-FU, and
doxorubicin, but not mitomycin C and paclitaxel, induces
Oct4 expression. Moreover, knockdown of endogenous
Oct4 expression sensitizes bladder cancer cells to
cisplatin, 5-FU, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and
methotrexate, but not to mitomycin C. Despite the fact
that Oct4 is not induced following paclitaxel treatment,
knockdown of Oct4 enhances sensitivity of bladder
cancer cells to paclitaxel. Notably, mitomycin C fails

to induce Oct4 expression. Furthermore, knockdown of
Oct4 expression in bladder cancer cells does not affect
their sensitivity to mitomycin C. Taken together, these
results suggest that Oct4 either directly or indirectly
contributes to the cross-resistance of bladder cancer cells
to the chemotherapeutic drugs used for patients with
bladder cancer, including cisplatin, 5-FU, doxorubicin,
paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and methotrexate. However,
resistance mechanism of mitomycin C in bladder cancer
is independent of Oct4. Given multiples functions of Oct4
in cancer cells, further studies are required to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying the role of Oct4 in the resistance
of bladder cancer cells to different anticancer drugs.
Patients with metastatic bladder cancer are treated
with cisplatin-containing systemic chemotherapy, such
as gemcitabine plus cisplatin, as the standard first-line
therapy. However, treatment failure is commonly caused

cellular uptake, increased efflux, increased DNA repair,
and hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene, a mismatch
repair gene [19]. In the present study, we demonstrate
that treatment with cisplatin increases expression of Oct4,
contributing to chemoresistance and tumor recurrence.
Our data can explain, in part, the high recurrence rate
and drug resistance of bladder cancer from neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. However, large-scale studies on the
comparison between neoadjuvant and postoperative
chemotherapy should be conducted for further evaluation.
The multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype has
been widely recognized in chemotherapy for bladder
cancer [35]. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
family of transmembrane proteins have been linked to
resistance of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, methotrexate, and
mitomycin C by promoting drug efflux in various cancer
types [36]. For cisplatin resistance, limited intracellular
accumulation of cisplatin most often derives from reduced
uptake, rather than increased efflux [37]. Mitomycin C,
a DNA cross-linking agent, is unique as an anticancer
drug in that it is preferentially converted to an active form
through enzymatic reduction in hypoxic regions of solid
tumors [38]. It is thus more toxic to hypoxic cells than
to aerobic cells [39, 40]. Regarding antimetabolites 5-FU,
gemcitabine, and methotrexate used in the present study,
increased expression of thymidylate synthase, which is the
target of 5-FU, was shown to be a resistance mechanism
to 5-FU [41]. Dysregulation of the enzymes participating
in the gemcitabine metabolic pathway is one of the
mechanisms responsible for gemcitabine resistance [42].
Amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene
resulting in increased levels of the enzyme was identified
as one mechanism of acquired methotrexate resistance
[43]. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of bladder
cancer as well as the variety of mechanisms involved in
drug resistance, further studies are warranted to uncover
the molecular basis by which Oct4 induces acquired
resistance of bladder cancer to different anticancer drugs.
In the management of cancer patients, drug
resistance is a major cause of treatment failure. Our results
indicate that suppression of Oct4 expression may improve
drug susceptibility to overcome the acquired resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs. ATRA, a derivative of vitamin
A, can promote ES cell differentiation by repressing Oct4
gene expression through several retinoic acid-responsive
elements (RAREs) located in the promoter-enhancer
region of the Oct4 gene [21]. We have previously shown
that inhibition of Oct4 expression by ATRA in bladder
cancer cells renders cells less susceptible to cytolytic
effects induced by an oncolytic adenovirus carrying the
Oct4 response element (ORE) [44]. In the present study, we
demonstrate that inhibition of Oct4 expression by ATRA
improves the sensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin. ATRA
is used as an anticancer agent for acute promyelocytic
leukemia [45]. The combined treatment with ketoconazole

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and ATRA for bladder cancer after transurethral resection
of bladder tumor (TURBT) significantly improved the
survival and reduced recurrence through decreasing
levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
transforming growth factor-α (TGF-β) [46]. In addition,
when compared with methotrexate, vinblastine, and
doxorubicin plus cisplatin, combination treatment with
gemcitabine plus cisplatin offered a similar survival
result but with a better safety profile and tolerability in
patients with bladder cancer [47, 48]. In the present study,
we demonstrate the synergistic cytotoxicity of ATRA
combined with cisplatin, suggesting that inhibition of Oct4
may be a potentially effective therapeutic strategy against
cancer and provide an additional benefit for chemotherapy
and/or radiotherapy.
ATRA exerts pleiotropic effects on cell proliferation
and differentiation, which can be independent of its
effect on Oct4 gene expression [45]. It can promote the
differentiation of dendritic cells in cancer patients [49]. It
has also been suggested to modulate the MAPK pathway
[50] and repress invasion and stem cell phenotypes by
induction of metastasis suppressors through RAREs
[51]. Therefore, ATRA provides multiple advantages for
cancer therapy because it induces differentiation of CSClike cells, rendering them sensitive to chemotherapy.
ATRA-mediated Oct4 inhibition may not only suppress
the promoter activity of Oct4, but also be through the
degradation of Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. Pin1
is induced upon cellular reprogramming and enhances
generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells
[52]. Pin1 interacts with the phosphorylated Ser12-Pro
motif of Oct4, which in turn facilitates the stability and
transcriptional activity functions of Oct4. Thus, ATRA
simultaneously blocks multiple Pin1-regulated cancerdriving pathways, an attractive property for treating
aggressive and drug-resistant tumors [53].
In the present study, we have provided evidence that
Oct4 expression is enhanced in bladder cancer cells after
treatment with various chemotherapeutic agents, rendering
bladder cancer chemoresistant. In a broad sense, as Oct4 is
expressed in a variety of cancers, chemotherapy-induced
Oct4 expression and the resultant drug resistance may also
operate in different cancers. A growing body of evidence
has shown multifunctional oncogenic transcription factors
as potential targets for cancer therapy. Since cisplatinbased chemotherapy is common for cancer therapy,
suppression of Oct4 expression by the pharmacological
inhibitor ATRA or RNA interference-mediated silencing
may provide a promising strategy for treating different
cancers. This notion is clearly demonstrated in our
results by the synergistic antitumor effects of combined
treatment of cisplatin and ATRA on mice bearing Oct4overexpressing human bladder tumor xenografts.
Furthermore, our findings also reinforce the importance of
precautions on preventing drug resistance via Oct4 when

neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered. Although we
show that Oct4 induces acquired resistance of cancer cells
to chemotherapeutic agents, the exact mechanisms of how
anticancer drugs enhance Oct4 expression to confer drug
resistance remain to be further investigated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis

Clinical specimens

Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed into
cDNA using the Verso™ cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was
performed using a SmartCycler System (Cephid). Each
reaction contained 50 ng cDNA, SYBR Premix Ex Taq
(TaKaRa), and 5 μmol of each forward and reverse
primer. The following primers were used: human
Oct4, 5’-GTCCGAGTGTGGTTCTGTA-3’ (forward)
and 5’-CTCAGTTTGAATGCATGGGA-3’ (reverse);
human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH),
5’-ACTTCAACAGCGACACCCACT-3’
(forward) and 5’-GCCAAATTCGTTGTCATACCAG-3’
(reverse). Normalization was performed using GAPDH
as the internal control, and relative gene expression was
calculated using the comparative 2(-∆∆Ct) method [56].

This study analyzed 122 specimens of 110
consecutive patients with high-grade, stages T1-2
urothelial carcinoma of urinary bladder treated with
TURBT between 2006 and 2010 at National Cheng Kung
University (NCKU) Hospital. After TURBT, these patients
received intravesical chemotherapy with epirubicin.
None of the patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy
or preoperative radiotherapy. There was no metastatic
disease at the time of surgery. This study was approved
by Institutional Review Board of NCKU Hospital, and
informed consent was obtained from each patient. Tumor
recurrence was determined from hospital records.

Cell culture and mice

Immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and
immunofluorescence

Human bladder cancer cell lines (TCCSUP,
J82, TSGH-8301, and T24) and human immortalized
uroepithelial cell line (SV-HUC-1) have been
previously described [44]. Cells were cultured in
complete medium consisting of Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
cosmic calf serum (Hyclone), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
and 50 μg/mL gentamicin. Stable Oct4-overexpressing
or Oct4-knockdown cells were established using
lentiviral vectors and puromycin selection as described
previously [54, 55]. Cisplatin-resistant TCCSUP cells
were obtained by culturing cells in complete medium
containing cisplatin (1 μg/ml). Male 6-8-week-old
NOD/SCID mice were obtained from the Laboratory
Animal Center of NCKU. All animal experiments
were conducted following the guidelines approved by
the Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of
NCKU.

For immunohistochemistry, specificity of the antiOct4 antibody used in this study has been validated in
our previous papers showing immunoreactivity with
bladder cancer cells and ES cells, but not with normal
cells [14, 44]. Immunohistochemistry was performed
on serial formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of
human and mouse bladder tissue after antigen retrieval
with proteinase K. After blocking with 5% BSA, tissue
sections were incubated with mouse anti-Oct4 monoclonal
antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-5279) at 4°C overnight,
followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson
Laboratory, 115-035-003) at room temperature for 2 h. The
reactivity was visualized with aminoethyl carbazole (red
color, Invitrogen) and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Immunoblot analysis was performed to detect Oct4,
RARα, and β-actin (as the loading control) using rabbit
anti-Oct4 antibody (Cell Signaling, #2750), goat antiRARα (Abcam, ab28767), and anti-β-actin-peroxidase
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, A3854), respectively, as
previously described [57]. For immunofluorescence
staining, cancer cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 min, treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for
5 min at room temperature, and then blocked with 1%
bovine serum albumin. Sections of formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded human and mouse bladder tissue
were also subjected to immunofluorescence staining,
as previously described [58]. Cells and tumor tissue

Plasmids and lentiviral vectors
The lentiviral vector encoding human Oct4 was
purchased from Addgene (pSin-EF2-Oct4-Pur, Addgene
plasmid 16579). To construct the control lentiviral
vector pSin-null, pSin-EF2-Oct4-Pur was digested
with SpeI and BamHI to excise the Oct4 cDNA, and
the resulting large fragment was filled-in with T4 DNA
polymerase (Takara) and subsequently self-ligated by T4
DNA ligase (Invitrogen). For knockdown experiments,
pLKO.1-puro-based lentiviral vectors, including
stem-loop cassettes encoding shRNA for human Oct4

sections were then incubated with anti-CD44-PE antibody
(Miltenyi Biotec, 130-098-108) and mouse anti-Oct4
monoclonal (Santa Cruz, sc-5279) at 4°C overnight. After
being washed with PBS, they were sequentially incubated
with Alexa Fluor488-goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Life
Technologies, A-11001) for 2 h at room temperature. The
nucleus was counterstained with DAPI (50 μg/ml).

Recurrence-free curves were calculated by the
Kaplan and Meier method and compared by the log-rank
test. Differences in the expression levels of Oct4 between
primary and recurrent tumor tissue were evaluated with
the Mann-Whitney U test. Differences in tumor volume
and cell viability between groups were compared by
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated
measures. The remaining data were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. The differences
were considered significant if P values were < 0.05.

Drug sensitivity assay and drug combination
analysis
Various bladder cancer cells (2 × 103) that were
cultured in 96-well plates in complete medium overnight
were refed with fresh medium containing various
concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs and cultured for
72 h. A colorimetric WST-8 assay (Dojindo Laboratories)
was used to determine cell viability. The IC50 values were
determined as the drug concentration at 50% inhibition of
cell growth.
To analyze the effect of the drug combination,
TCCSUP cells (4 × 103) cultured in 96-well plates were
treated with cisplatin ranging from 0 to 10 μg/ml plus
ATRA (0.1 μM) or the solvent for 72 h. The cytotoxic
effect was assessed by the WST-8 assay. The CDI was
used to analyze drug combinations as previously described
[22–24]. The CDI was calculated by the following
formula: CDI = AB/(A × B). AB is the survival rate of the
two-drug combination group relative to the control group,
and A or B is the survival rate of the single drug group
relative to the control group. The CDI values of < 1, = 1,
and > 1 indicate that the drugs are synergistic, additive,
and antagonistic, respectively.

NOD/SCID mice were inoculated subcutaneously
with parental or cisplatin-resistant TCCSUP cells (1 × 107)
at day 0, followed by intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin
(4 mg/kg) at days 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. In addition, Oct4overexpressing and control TCCSUP cells were employed
for in vivo experiments. TCCSUP cells (2 × 106) that had
been transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding Oct4 or
with control vectors were inoculated subcutaneously into
the right flank of NOD/SCID mice at day 0. Subsequently,
the mice were treated intraperitoneally with cisplatin (4
mg/kg) or saline when their tumor volumes reached 100
mm3. In other sets of the experiment, TCCSUP tumorbearing NOD/SCID mice were treated intraperitoneally
with cisplatin (4 mg/kg), ATRA (10 mg/kg), saline, or
the vehicle (solvent) alone. Furthermore, the tumorbearing mice were treated with cisplatin, cisplatin plus
ATRA, cisplatin plus solvent, or saline. All of the mice
were monitored for tumor growth. Tumor volumes were
calculated as: length × width2 × 0.45.
