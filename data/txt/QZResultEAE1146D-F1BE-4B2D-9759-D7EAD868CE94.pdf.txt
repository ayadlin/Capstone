Abstract
Vaccines explored for cancer therapy have been based generally on injectable vector systems used to control
foreign infectious pathogens, to which the immune system evolved to respond naturally. However, these vectors
may not be effective at presenting tumor-associated antigens (TAA) to the immune system in a manner that is
sufﬁcient to engender antitumor responses. We addressed this issue with a novel orally administered Salmonellabased vector that exploits a type III secretion system to deliver selected TAA in the cytosol of professional antigenpresenting cells in situ. A systematic comparison of candidate genes from the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island
2 (SPI2) locus was conducted in the vaccine design, using model antigens and a codon-optimized form of the
human TAA survivin (coSVN), an oncoprotein that is overexpressed in most human cancers. In a screen of 20 SPI2
promoter:effector combinations, a PsifB::sseJ combination exhibited maximal potency for antigen translocation
into the APC cytosol, presentation to CD8 T cells, and murine immunogenicity. In the CT26 mouse model of colon
carcinoma, therapeutic vaccination with a lead PsifB::sseJ-coSVN construct (p8032) produced CXCR3-dependent
inﬁltration of tumors by CD8 T cells, reversed the CD8:Treg ratio at the tumor site, and triggered potent antitumor
activity. Vaccine immunogenicity and antitumor potency were enhanced by coadministration of the natural
killer T-cell ligand 7DW8-5, which heightened the production of IL12 and IFNg. Furthermore, combined
treatment with p8032 and 7DW8-5 resulted in complete tumor regression in A20 lymphoma-bearing mice,
where protective memory was demonstrated. Taken together, our results demonstrate how antigen delivery
using an oral Salmonella vector can provide an effective platform for the development of cancer vaccines.

Introduction
Despite the identiﬁcation of potentially immunogenic tumorassociated antigens (TAA) in many types of cancer, current
therapeuticcancer vaccines remainlargely ineffective(1). Oneof
the major limitations of the modern vectors for cancer vaccines
is that, unlike infectious pathogens to which the immune system
has evolved to respond, they are unable to effectively deliver
TAAs in an immunogenic form to intact professional antigenpresenting cells (APC). To address this challenge, attenuated
viral or bacterial vectors, including Salmonella, have been used

in experimental cancer vaccines to deliver TAAs to host APCs in
situ (2). Because Salmonella naturally migrates from the intestine to the mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen, Salmonellabased vectors induce a systemic immune response to the
bacterially expressed antigens (3–5).
We recently reported a new strategy for an oral vaccine for
cancer, in which the type III secretion system (T3SS) of
Salmonella is exploited for translocation of TAAs into the
cytosol of APCs that generate tumor-speciﬁc CTLs (6–9). Some
T3SS effector proteins are encoded by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) locus and are activated only when
Salmonella is inside macrophages or dendritic cells (DC;
refs. 10–12). This enables the use of live attenuated Salmonella
vectors for delivery of the heterologous antigens of interest into
the class-I antigen presentation pathway of intact professional
APCs in situ. We have reported the use of the SPI2 system to
construct cancer vaccines in which human survivin (SVN) or its
codon-optimized version (coSVN) was expressed under control of the SPI2 promoter PsseA and fused to the gene for effector
SseF for translocation (6, 7). As human and murine survivin are
highly homologous (13), these vaccines induced CD8 T-cell–
mediated antitumor activity in murine tumors that overexpress SVN (6, 7). However, without additional manipulation of
the tumor microenvironment, the therapeutic activity was
modest and transient.

Bacterial Genes Enable Design of Effective Cancer Vaccine

CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells play a critical
role in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses and
may be recruited for effective immunotherapy of cancer (14,
15). Indeed, we have shown that synthetic NKT ligands, GSL1 or
aGalactosylceramide (aGalCer), enhanced the immunogenicity and antitumor efﬁcacy of our ﬁrst-generation Salmonellabased SVN vaccine (6). Since then, new NKT-cell ligands have
been discovered, including an analogue of aGalCer, 7DW8-5,
which has a stronger binding afﬁnity to CD1d and NKT-cell
TCR compared with aGalCer (16). During in vivo testing,
7DW8-5 exhibited a superior adjuvant effect compared with
aGalCer for HIV and malaria vaccines in mice (16) and is
currently being tested in primates, thus representing the
primary candidate for entering into clinical testing as a vaccine
adjuvant.
The goal of this study was to explore and exploit the full
potential of SPI2-encoded T3SS of Salmonella typhimurium for
construction of an effective cancer vaccine using coSVN as the
TAA of choice. We show that vaccination with PsifB::sseJ-coSVN
(p8032) not only increased the frequency of antigenic-speciﬁc
CD8 T cells compared with the previous coSVN vaccine
(P3342Max), but also resulted in a dense tumor inﬁltration
with CD8 T cells and enhanced antitumor activity in the CT26
colon cancer model. The addition of 7DW8-5 as an adjuvant
further increased vaccine immunogenicity and the persistence

of circulating antigen-speciﬁc CD8 T cells compared with
p8032 alone. Finally, we found that therapeutic vaccination
with p8032/7DW8-5 resulted in complete tumor regression in
the A20 lymphoma model.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Murine CT26 colon carcinoma and A20 B-cell lymphoma cell
lines were obtained from Dr. Terabe (NIH/NCI, Bethesda, MD)
and ATCC, respectively. The identities of both cell lines were
authenticated using short tandem repeats proﬁling by DDC
Medical, inc. on June 23, 2014.
Strains of Salmonella typhimurium, plasmids, and
constructs
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium),
purD/htrA double-deﬁcient strain MvP728 was previously
described (6). For the generation of recombinant plasmids,
Escherichia coli DH5a was used as host. Low copy-number
plasmid pWSK29 was used for the generation of expression
cassettes consisting of SPI2 gene fusions with the indicated
antigens as summarized in Table 1. Generation of plasmids and
the sequence of codon-optimized human survivin are
described in Supplementary Methods.

In vitro antigen presentation assay
Murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DC) were
generated and used in the antigen presentation assay as
previously described in ref. 17 and Supplementary Methods.

Prism 5.02 software (GraphPad). P values < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. All experiments were repeated at least twice,
and data are presented as Mean  SD.  , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;
and  , P < 0.001.

Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
To detect and quantify the intracellular expression of recombinant proteins produced by MvP728 transformed with the
experimental or control plasmids, BM-DCs were infected with
MvP728 at a multiplicity of infection of 10. At 16 hours after
infection, the cells were ﬁxed and processed for immunostaining
of Salmonella LPS (rabbit anti-Salmonella O4,5, Difco, BD),
Armenian hamster anti-CD11c (BD), and mouse anti-HA epitope
tag (Roche). Fluorescence images were acquired on a Zeiss
LSM700 laser-scanning confocal microscope using ZEN software.

Results

Tumor models
BALB/c female mice 6 to 8 weeks of age (Jackson Laboratory)
were maintained at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX)
animal care facility and were treated according to the appropriate Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocols. The
tumor models and vaccination protocols have been described
(Supplementary Methods; ref. 6).
ELISpot assay
Splenocytes were isolated from vaccinated or control mice
and restimulated with a peptide mix from human survivin
library (JPT) in vitro followed by 7 days culture in the presence
of 50 U/mL IL2. The frequency of survivin-speciﬁc IFNgsecreting cells was determined using an ELISpot Assay Kit
(R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
ELISA
The concentrations of IL12 p70 and IFNg were quantiﬁed in
mouse serum using respective ELISA kits (R&D Systems)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Dendritic cell vaccine
BM-DCs were pulsed with human Survivin PepMix peptide
library consisting of a pool of 33 peptides (15 mers with 11 aa
overlap, JPT) for 24 hours. Cells were then harvested, washed,
and intravenously administrated (5  105 cells per mouse) at
the same schedule as the Salmonella-based vaccine.
Flow cytometry
The reagents for ﬂow cytometry are described in Supplementary Methods. The analysis was performed on a LSR-II ﬂow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) using BD FACDiva software v. 6.0.
Statistical analyses
The comparisons between groups were based on the twosided unpaired Student t test or one-way ANOVA with the
Tukey–Kramer posttest comparison of group means. The
Kaplan–Meier method was used to compute survival probabilities and produce survival curves. The analysis of the difference in survival between groups was based on the log-rank
test. Statistical computations were performed with GraphPad

Selection of optimal SPI2 promoter and effector protein
for antigen delivery to APC cytosol via Salmonella T3SS
Our original SVN vaccine used the sseA promoter and
effector sseF for antigen expression and intracellular translocation, respectively (6). To comprehensively evaluate the
potential of genes of the SsrAB virulon of S. typhimurium, we
compared their promoter and effector activities to express and
translocate heterologous proteins for antigen presentation.
The results from these studies are summarized in two recent
publications from our laboratories (8, 17). On the basis of these
results, we selected the four strongest in vivo-induced promoters (PsifB, PsseJ, PsifA, and PsseA; ref. 8) and tested combinations
thereof with ﬁve genes sseJ, sifA, steC, sseL, and sseF encoding
translocated effector proteins (17) using OVA as a model
antigen in an in vitro antigen presentation assay. We selected
the effector proteins SseJ, SifA, SteC, and SseL for comparison
with the previously used effector protein SseF because these
proteins show a characteristic association with endosomal
membranes of the host cell after translocation, long half-life,
and high amounts of translocated fusion proteins (17). We
hypothesized that these parameters affect the efﬁcacy of
antigen presentation. Figure 1A demonstrates that the PsifB::
sseJ combination (p3643) induced the highest level of antigen
presentation compared with all other examined combinations.
Compared with PsseA::sseF (p2629), which served as a basis for
our ﬁrst-generation SPI2-based vaccines (6), p3643 produced
2.5-fold higher antigen presentation activity (P < 0.001).
To test the efﬁcacy of target protein translocation into the
APC cytosol, we expressed the Listeria gene lisA (encodes
listeriolysin O protein, LLO) with PsifB::sseJ (p8011) or PsseA::
sseF (p2810) and infected BM-DCs with MvP728 carrying either
vector control, p2810 or p8011. The immunoﬂuorescence
microscopy analysis of HA-tagged LLO demonstrates that
p8011 translocated LLO into BM-DC cytosol much more
effectively than p2810 (Fig. 1B). Next, we compared the in vivo
immunogenicity of PsifB::sseJ vaccine with that of PsseA::sseF. To
that end, we examined generation of LLO-speciﬁc CD8 T cells
after immunization of mice with p2810, p8011, or vector
control. Figure 1C and D demonstrates that p8011 induced
a frequency of LLO-speciﬁc CD8 T cells nearly ﬁve times higher
than that of p2810 (P < 0.001). Therefore, we selected the PsifB::
sseJ promoter/effector combination for the expression and
delivery of heterologous antigens in the second generation of
the SPI2-based vaccination platform.
Enhanced TAA translocation, immunogenicity, and
antitumor activity of new survivin vaccine
Our previously reported PsseA::sseF-driven cancer vaccines
expressed human survivin (SVN, p3342; ref. 6) or codon-optimized survivin (coSVN, p3342Max; ref. 7) as a TAA. Here, we
expressed coSVN under the control of PsifB::sseJ (p8032) and
compared it with p3342Max (Fig. 2A). To visualize and quantify

Figure 2B and C demonstrates that p8032 delivered signiﬁcantly larger amounts of the recombinant protein into the cell
cytosol compared with p3342Max (P < 0.001). Moreover, ELISpot assays showed that vaccination of mice with p8032
induced a higher frequency of SVN-speciﬁc IFNg-producing
T cells in the spleen compared with p3342Max (Fig. 2D). Finally,
vaccination with p8032 more effectively inhibited tumor
growth in the CT26 colon carcinoma model than p3342Max

(P < 0.01; Fig. 2E). Therefore, compared with the ﬁrst-generation SPI2-based vaccines, PsifB::sseJ-based vaccines possess a

with the limited CD8 T-cell inﬁltration in the tumors of control
or p3342Max-treated mice, the tumors of mice vaccinated with
p8032 had dense CD8 T-cell inﬁltrates. We also performed
FACS on cell preparations homogenized from the same tumor
tissues and examined the frequencies of CD8 and CD4 T cells,
including Tregs (CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ). Figure 3B demonstrates that vaccination with p3342Max alone had no impact
on the composition of tumor-inﬁltrating T cells. In contrast,
vaccination with p8032 reversed the CD8:CD4 ratio and
increased the CD8 T-cell frequency 2-fold, compared with the
vector control (P < 0.001). Moreover, the p8032 induced >3-fold
increase of the CD8:Treg ratio and CD8:tumor cell ratio in the
tumor parenchyma compared with the vector control or
p3342Max (P < 0.01, Fig. 3C and D).
To examine the mechanism responsible for CD8 T-cell
trafﬁcking to the tumor site, we ﬁrst compared serum concentrations of 12 chemokines/cytokines in tumor-bearing and
na€ve mice using a Luminex assay and found that only CXCL10

6264

Cancer Res; 74(21) November 1, 2014

and CCL2 were consistently increased in the serum of tumorbearing mice (P < 0.01, Supplementary Fig. S1A). The CXCL10
concentration was about 10 times higher than that of CCL2.
Moreover, CXCL10 could also be detected at high concentrations in tumor lysates, in which its concentration, normalized
by tumor weight, was similar in mice that received therapeutic
vaccines or vector control (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Next, we
analyzed expression of the corresponding chemokine receptor,
CXCR3 on tumor-inﬁltrating and spleen CD8 T cells in mice
vaccinated with different vectors. Compared with the control
vector, vaccination with p8032 (but not p3342Max) signiﬁcantly increased the frequency of CXCR3-positive CD8 T cells
in the spleen (Fig. 3E and F, P < 0.001). More than 90% of tumorinﬁltrating CD8 T cells were CXCR3 positive regardless of the
vaccination (Fig. 3E), suggesting that CXCL10-CXCR3 axis
directs localization of CD8 T cells to the tumor site in this
model. Furthermore, treatment of mice with an anti-CXCR3
blocking mAb abrogated the p8032-induced CD8 T-cell inﬁltration to the tumor site (Fig. 3G and Supplementary Fig. S2)

and antitumor activity of the vaccine (Fig. 3H). Therefore, the
increased therapeutic activity of p8032 vaccine is associated
with an increased tumor inﬁltration by CD8 T cells and the
reversal of the CD8:Treg ratio. Tumor inﬁltration depends on
CXCR3 expression on CD8 T cells, which is selectively upregulated by p8032 vaccine.
Adjuvant activity of NKT ligand, 7DW8-5
To examine whether immunogenicity of PsifB::sseJ-driven
vaccines can be enhanced by NKT-cell ligand, 7DW8-5, we
vaccinated mice with LLO construct (p8011) alone or in
combination with 7DW8-5. All mice received two boosts
with the vaccine alone. Figure 4A and B demonstrates that
the frequency of LLO-reactive CD8 T cells in peripheral
blood was signiﬁcantly higher in mice that received LLO
vaccine with 7DW8-5 compared with the vaccine alone at all
examined intervals (P < 0.001). The control groups that

www.aacrjournals.org

received empty vector with 7DW8-5 had no detectable
LLO-speciﬁc CTLs. Next, we tested 7DW8-5 in combination
with the new coSVN vaccine p8032 and found that the ligand
enhanced generation of SVN-speciﬁc IFNg-producing T cells
compared with the vaccine alone as measured by ELISpot
assay (Fig. 4C, P < 0.01). Consistent with the reported
properties of 7DW8-5 (16), its administration caused rapid
activation of NKT and trans-activation of NK cells as well as
upregulation of costimulatory molecules in spleen DCs
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Compared with the vaccine alone,
the administration of 7DW8-5 either alone or with the
vaccine resulted in dramatic increases of IL12 and IFNg
serum concentrations within 6 and 24 hours, respectively
(Fig. 4D). Therefore, 7DW8-5 has a potent adjuvant activity
for the PsifB::sseJ-driven vaccine that is associated with the
upregulation of IL12 and IFNg, which support Th-1 immune
response and CTL generation.

were vaccinated with p3342Max, p8032, or p8032 with 7DW8-5.
Control mice received an empty vector alone or with 7DW8-5.
To compare the efﬁcacy of the p8032 vaccine with a commonly
used vaccination modality (18), we used ex-vivo generated DCs
pulsed with a human survivin peptide library and 7DW8-5 as an
adjuvant. Figure 5A and B demonstrates that p8032 vaccine
signiﬁcantly delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival
compared with p3342Max (P < 0.001). The addition of
7DW8-5 further enhanced the antitumor activity of p8032
vaccine, so that median survival of the animals was nearly
doubled compared with the control group (P < 0.001). Moreover, p8032/7DW8-5 was more effective than DC/7DW8-5 (P <
0.001, Fig. 5A–C). However, the addition of 7DW8-5 to p8032
vaccine did not further increase the number of tumor-inﬁltrating CD8 T cells or the CD8:Treg ratio compared with the
vaccine alone (data not shown). Staining with CD1d/PBS57

tetramers found no detectable NKT cells within tumor-inﬁltrating leukocytes regardless of 7DW8-5 treatment (data not
shown), suggesting that 7DW8-5-activated NKT cells function
only at the initiation of the immune response in this model.
To determine the requirement of the major lymphocyte
subsets for the observed antitumor activity of p8032 vaccine
with 7DW8-5 as an adjuvant, we repeated the treatment of
CT26 tumor-bearing mice using anti-CD8 (CD8 T cells), antiCD4 (a subset of NKT cells and T-helper cells), or anti-asialoGM1 (NK cells) depleting antibodies before vaccine
treatment. Figure 5D shows that although the therapeutic
activity of the vaccine alone depends only on CD8 T cells, the
p8032/7DW8-5 combination depends on both CD8 T cells and
CD4 cells, which include subsets of NKT and T cells. Despite the
observed activation of NK cells early after 7DW8-5 injection,
NK cells were not required for the vaccine antitumor activity
with or without the adjuvant. Therefore, p8032/7DW8-5 vaccine has a potent antitumor activity, which depends on CD8
T cells and help from CD4-positive NKT-cell subset or T-helper
cells.

Curative activity of p8032/7DW8-5 vaccine in A20
lymphoma model
To determine whether the therapeutic potential of the new
SVN vaccine extends beyond the CT26 tumor model, we tested
efﬁcacy in the A20 B-cell lymphoma model. Figure 6A and B
demonstrates that p8032 was again superior to p3342Max and
the vaccine's therapeutic efﬁcacy was further enhanced by
7DW8-5. Although the trend was the same as in the CT26
model, the differences between groups in the A20 model were
more striking. Although p3342Max only delayed tumor growth,
it did not cure mice of tumors. In contrast, p8032 without or
with 7DW8-5 cured half or all mice, respectively. Moreover, the
cured animals developed protective immune memory, as none
of them developed tumors after injection of A20 cells in the
contralateral ﬂank at day 60, whereas all na€ve mice grew
progressive tumors from the same A20 preparations (Fig. 6D).
Therefore, p8032 vaccine has a potent antitumor activity in the

A20 lymphoma model, which is further enhanced by 7DW8-5 as
an adjuvant.

Discussion
In this work, we describe the systematic evaluation of
Salmonella SPI2-T3SS effector proteins and their promoters
for use in cancer vaccines. We found that the combination of
SPI2 promoter PsifB with effector gene sseJ provides maximal
antitumor immunogenicity. The resulting coSVN-expressing
vaccine (p8032) induced CXCR3-dependent tumor inﬁltration
by CD8 T cells and had potent therapeutic activity in two
separate tumor models. The vaccine immunogenicity and
antitumor efﬁcacy were further enhanced by an NKT-cell
ligand, 7DW8-5, used as an adjuvant.
Among multiple factors that contribute to the efﬁcacy of
SPI2-based vaccines, the choice of a promoter for target

antigen expression and an effector protein as a fusion partner
for antigen translocation is of particular importance. Previous
studies from our groups have evaluated the promoter activities
of genes of the SsrAB virulon in S. typhimurium (17) and various
SPI2-T3SS effector proteins for translocation of heterologous
antigens (8). In the present study, we have found a novel
promoter/effector combination, PsifB::sseJ, which enables the
maximal level of antigen presentation in APCs to CD8 T cells.
Importantly, PsifB::sseJ-based vaccines with either LLO or SVN
as an antigen demonstrated a dramatically stronger immunogenicity in mice compared with our ﬁrst-generation SPI2
vaccines with the same antigens.
Compared with the previous version of coSVN-expressing
vaccine p3342max, p8032 demonstrated a much enhanced
antitumor activity in two murine cancer models. Of particular
importance, only vaccination with p8032 resulted in tumor
inﬁltration with CD8 T cells and the reversal of the CD8:Treg
ratio. This observation is consistent with accumulating evidence from both mouse models and clinical trials that shifting
the balance toward CD8 T cells versus Tregs at the tumor site is
critical to the success of cancer immunotherapy (19–21). To
achieve such an effect, previously reported Salmonella-based
vaccines were used in combination with other therapies that
target the tumor microenvironment. For example, an attenuated Salmonella strain VNP20009 (22), modiﬁed with a DNA
plasmid expressing the shRNA speciﬁc for indoleamine 2,3dioxygenase, extended survival in murine models of melanoma
and pancreatic cancer (23, 24). In the case of p3342Max, CD8 Tcell inﬁltration and potent antitumor activity in B16F10 melanoma model were achieved when the vaccine was combined
with a tumor-targeted Stat3 shRNA (7).
The increased tumor inﬁltration with CD8 T cells and the
therapeutic activity induced by the p8032 vaccine were dependent on the induction of CXCR3 expression on CD8 T cells.
CXCL10, the ligand for CXCR3 was abundantly produced by
CT26 tumor grafts. Although normal epithelial cells produce
CXCL10 in response to IFNg at the initiation of immune
response (25), CXCL10 expression in colon cancer cells has
been reported to be under control of oncogenic Ras signaling
(26), and human colon cancer cells expressing both CXCL10
and CXCR3 have been shown to have enhanced growth and
invasion properties (27). Moreover, a subset of Tregs expresses
CXCR3 and preferentially accumulates in CXCL10-producing
solid tumors (28). Thus, although tumor cells produce CXCL10
to support growth, metastasis, and immune evasion, effective
vaccines may exploit this phenomenon for tumor eradication
via induction of CXCR3 expression on tumor-speciﬁc CD8 T
cells.
We found that new synthetic NKT-cell ligand 7DW8-5 is a
potent adjuvant for the p8032 vaccine. The addition of

7DW8-5 induced production of large amounts of IL12 and
IFNg in mice and increased both the magnitude and duration of the vaccine-induced CD8 T-cell response that may
explain the increased therapeutic efﬁcacy of the combined
treatment. The effect of 7DW8-5 is similar to that of other
NKT ligands used as vaccine adjuvants (6, 16, 29). The
mechanism of the adjuvant activity of NKT ligands involves
bidirectional interactions between NKT cells and DCs that
have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (15, 30, 31). However, no cure has been achieved in the CT26 model. A recent
study demonstrated that PD1- and CTLA-4–mediated inhibition contributes to the immune suppressive microenvironment in CT26 tumor (21). That study also found that
GVAX vaccination in combination with the blockade of both
PD-1 and CTLA-4 produced tumor regression. Therefore, a
systematic evaluation of Salmonella-based vaccines in combination with the checkpoint blockade therapies would be a
logical avenue for a future investigation.
The therapeutic activity of p8032/7DW8-5 was curative in an
A20 lymphoma model. Moreover, cured animals developed a
long-lasting protective memory response. These observations
are consistent with the properties of NKT ligands to potentiate
development of memory CD8 T-cell responses via enhanced
production of IL12 by DCs and IFNg by both NKT and NK cells
(32, 33). In the current study, the antitumor activity of p8032/
7DW8-5 was unequivocally dependent on CD8 T cells and CD4
cells, which include about half of NKT cells (34) and conventional T-helper cells. Although NKT cells were speciﬁcally
activated by 7DW8-5, the contribution of conventional CD4
T cells cannot be excluded as antigen-speciﬁc CD4 T cells can
help CD8 T cells during the priming and maintenance of
memory response (35, 36). In conclusion, the vaccination

approach we described, using the molecular machinery of
SPI2-encoded T3SS system of Salmonella, may provide a foundation for clinical trials of new oral vaccines for many types of
cancer.
