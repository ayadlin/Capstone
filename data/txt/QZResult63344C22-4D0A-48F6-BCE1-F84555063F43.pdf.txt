ABSTRACT
Protein kinases play a central role in the oncogenesis of colorectal tumors
and are attractive druggable targets. Detection of activated kinases within a tumor
could open avenues for drug selection and optimization of new kinase inhibitors. By
using a phosphokinase arrays with human colorectal tumors we identified activated
kinases, including the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), components of the
PI3K/mTOR pathway (AKT and S6), and STAT, among others. A pharmacological
screening with kinase inhibitors against these proteins helped us to identify a new
kinase inhibitor, termed EC-70124 that showed the highest anti-proliferative activity
in cell lines. EC-70124 also inhibited cell migration and biochemical experiments
demonstrated its effect targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway. This drug also arrested
cells at G2/M and induced apoptosis. Experiments in combination with standard
chemotherapy used in the clinical setting indicated a synergistic effect. EC-70124
also reduced tumor growth in vivo and inhibited pS6 in the implanted tumors. In
conclusion, by studying the kinase profile of colorectal tumors, we identified relevant
activated pathways, and a new multi-kinase compound with significant antitumor
properties.

Taken into account that solid tumors, and
particularly colorectal cancer, is a heterogeneous disease
[2], the understanding of the kinase profile of this
tumor could help in the selection of relevant therapeutic
strategies. This approach has been used previously to
identify the PI3K/mTOR route as a relevant target in a
subtype of breast tumors [5]. In addition, the increase
therapeutic efficacy observed when acting concomitantly
against several kinases compared with single kinase
inhibition, suggests that the identification, selection, and
therapeutic optimization of inhibitors with a broader
effect on relevant proteins kinases can represent a better
therapeutic strategy, if there is no increase in toxicity [6].
In this regard, several proteins and signaling routes
are clearly activated in colon cancer and linked with
tumorigenesis. Some of them include the PI3K/mTOR
pathway, the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)

INTRODUCTION
Different molecular alterations have been described
in colorectal cancer. Among them, the unbalanced
activation of protein kinases plays a central role [1]. Several
of these proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTK) or signaling downstream mediators, have been
associated with the initiation, maintenance and progression
of this tumor type [1]. An example is the expression of
the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), and the
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR)
in colorectal cancer, that led to the clinical development
of drugs against them, such as panitumumab or cetuximab
against EGFR, and bevacizumab against VEGFR
[1, 2]. This activation is also associated with an oncogenic
advantage, as pharmacological inhibition with the
mentioned compounds is linked with clinical benefit [3, 4].

route, angiogenesis pathways or routes associated with
migration such as the FAK family of kinases [7, 8]. In
parallel with this, some of these routes have been linked
with resistance to targeted therapies against known
oncogenes reinforcing the concept that a global kinase
picture could undoubtedly provide useful information [9].
Therefore, a desirable approach would be the development
of polypharmacology inhibitors targeting simultaneously
several of these relevant pathways and proteins.
In the present work, we planned to explore the
kinase profile of primary colorectal tumors; and based
on these findings, to perform a pharmacologic screening
to recognize kinase inhibitors with anti-proliferative
effect. We identified a novel compound termed EC-70124
with an ample inhibitory spectrum including the PI3K/
mTOR pathway and SRC. EC-70124 showed inhibition
of proliferation and migration in preclinical models;
and tumor growth inhibitory properties in animals.
Furthermore, this compound induced DNA damage
and synergized with chemotherapy used in the clinical
setting. Taken together this data support the future clinical
evaluation of this compound in colorectal tumors.

Given the fact that selection of anti-EGFR therapies is
based on the presence of K-RAS mutations and that tumors
with constitutive activation of downstream mediators can
present secondary activating loops, we interrogated if
differences in the kinase profile among the two groups could
be identified. Therefore, we compared the kinase profile
in K-RAS mutated (n = 8) versus non-mutated (n = 10)
tumors. Expression of EGFR was similar in both groups,
but ALK, AKT/Thr308 and STAT1 were reduced in tumors
with K-RAS mutations (Figure 1C). No differences were
observed for the expression of pErk1/2. Other kinases
whose phosphorylation was reduced in K-RAS mutated
tumors included MSPR, FGFR3 and ErbB3 (Figure 1C).
Finally, we observed that an important number
of proteins were phosphorylated within the same tumor
(Figure 1D), supporting the idea that targeting of several
proteins or key signalling nodes could be a rational approach.

Pharmacologic evaluation with multi-kinase
inhibitors
Next, we decided to evaluate the effect on cell
proliferation of several kinase inhibitors designed against the
most frequently phosphorylated kinases observed in human
samples. We evaluated six different agents, including some
agents approved in cancer for other indications and a multikinase inhibitor currently in preclinical development. The
agents included lapatinib, as an EGFR and ErbB2 inhibitor,
sunitinib as a VEGFR2 and PDGFRβ inhibitor, crizotinib as
a c-MET and ALK inhibitor, dasatinib as a Abl, SRC and
c-Kit inhibitor, BEZ235 as a dual pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor,
and NVP-BSK805 as a JAK/STAT inhibitor (Figure 2A).
In addition, we evaluated a novel polypharmacology kinase
inhibitor termed EC-70124, a hybrid indolocarbazole
obtained by combinatorial biosynthesis of Rebeccamycin and
Staurosporin genes [10].
The effect on cell proliferation of these compounds
was evaluated in two colon cancer cell lines SW620, and
HT29 using the MTT metabolization assay. By doing a
dose response curve we observed different sensitivity to the
drugs evaluated. The proliferation assays showed that the
new multi-kinase inhibitor EC-70124 had a strong effect in
the cell lines studied compared with other agents. EC-70124
reached a half-maximal inhibitory effect in the nanomolar
range (below 200 nM) in the two cell lines (Figure 2A, 2B).
At doses below 500 nM only BEZ235 showed a relevant
effect on growth inhibition in SW620, but limited in HT29.
Dasatinib showed only antiproliferative effect in HT29.
We also investigated the effect of EC-70124 in threedimensional growth using the same cell lines. For this
purpose, we grew cells in matrigel, a semisolid media where
the cells grow forming spherical structures. Treatment with
EC-70124 strongly decreased the diameter of these spheres
(control vs treatment, mean diameter and SD = 3.62 +/−
0.11 vs 2.28 +/− 0.08 and 10,63 +/− 0.7 vs 1.1 +/− 0.1 for
SW620 and HT-29, respectively) (Figure 2C).

RESULTS
Phospho-kinase profile of human colorectal
tumors
We analyzed the activation status of several
RTKs and relevant signaling mediators in samples from
eighteen patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. To do
so, we used two antibody-based array kits that evaluate
the phosphorylation status of these proteins, as shown
in Supplementary Figure S1. Patient characteristics are
described in Table 1.
The analyses revealed that of the fifty-nine proteins
evaluated, only twenty-three were phosphorylated
(Figure 1A). The most phosphorylated RTKs involved
members of the ErbB receptor family (EGFR: 88.8%, n =
16; ErbB2: 50%, n = 9; ErbB3: 38.8%, n = 7; ErbB4 27.7%,
n = 5); followed by Alk (77.7%, n = 14), FGFR1 (61%, n =
11), FGFR3 (55.5%, n = 10), AXL (61%, n = 11), PDGFR
beta (55.5%, n = 10) or IR (50%, n = 9), among others.
We also observed activation of VEGFR1 (44%, n = 8) and
VEGFR3 (44%, n = 8). Phosphorylation of downstream
signalling regulators included components of the PI3K/
mTOR/AKT pathway (AKT/Thr 308: 83%, n = 15; pS6:
83%, n = 15) and STAT1 (83%, n = 15) (Figure 1A).
Next, we correlated the expression of RTKs and down­
stream mediators observed in human samples with those
of two representative cell lines of colorectal cancer,
SW620 and HT29. As can be seen in Figure 1B, some
of the most activated RTKs and downstream mediators in
human samples were also activated in SW620 or HT29,
confirming that these cell lines can be considered as a
good representative model.

Finally, we evaluated the effect of the drug on cell
migration. EC-70124 reduced the migration of the two cell
lines at 24 hours (Figure 2D).

G2/M phase (Figure 4A). Using Annexin V staining we
evaluated the induction of apoptosis. As can be seen in
figure 4B, treatment with EC-70124 induced apoptosis
only in SW620, that was confirmed by the biochemical
evaluation of PARP cleavage (Figure 4D). No such effect
was observed in HT29 (Figure 4B and 4D). To explore
the mechanism of cell death we treated both cells with the
pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and evaluated Annexin
V staining at 48 hours. No modifications in apoptosis
was found with the presence of the pancaspase inhibitor
in HT29, and a small induction in SW620 (Figure 4C).
This data shows that in SW620 induction of apoptosis was
both, dependent and independent of caspases.
In a previous evaluation of EC-70124 in breast cancer,
we observed that EC-70124 led to DNA damage [11].
To explore if this effect was also observed in colon cancer,
we assessed the accumulation of pH2AX and p-chk2 at
different time points in SW620 and HT29. Treatment
with EC-70124 augmented the levels of these proteins at
different time points suggesting that the drug caused DNA
damage in colon cancer cells (Figure 4D).

Effect of EC-70124 on the kinase profile of colon
cancer cell lines
To further evaluate the effect of EC-70124 on the
kinase profile, we analyzed the phosphorylation status
of several kinases in SW620 and HT29 before and after
treatment with the drug at 6, 12 and 24 hours. A common
pattern for these cell lines was the phosphorylated
presence of key signalling nodes including the PI3K/
mTOR pathway (AKT and S6) and SRC (Figure 3A, 3B),
and as described in Figure 1B. In SW620, SRC and LCK
were strongly activated in basal conditions and treatment
with EC-70124 caused a strong and maintained inhibition.
pS6 showed a relevant basal phosphorylation in SW620
and HT29 that was inhibited at short times. In HT29, pS6
and SRC which showed the highest phosphorylated level
among all kinases, were also inhibited. In this cell line
an increasing activation of Erk1/2 pathway was observed
after 6 hours of treatment (Figure 3A and 3B).

As success in cancer therapy is based on drug
combinations, we investigated the effect of EC-70124
in association with chemotherapies used in the clinical
setting for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer
including irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin.

Next we explored the effect of EC-70124 on cell
cycle and apoptosis. Propidium iodide staining revealed
that EC-70124 induced accumulation of cells in the

a straight line across the sphere diameter of untreated cells (controls) and scoring its value as arbitrary length units. Data are represented as the

Effect of EC-70124 on tumor growth in vivo

To identify synergistic interactions we used the ChouTalalay algorithm [12] for combination index analysis
in SW620 and HT29, at different concentrations
(Figure  5A). Combinations with irinotecan, oxaliplatin
and 5-fluorouracil were synergistic in the two cell lines,
at almost all evaluated doses (Figure 5A). Studies with
clonogenic assays confirmed the increased activity of
the combinations compared with each agent given alone
(Supplementary Figure S2A).
Finally, we explored the biochemical mechanism
of action associated with the combination of EC-70124
and chemotherapies. We observed how EC-70124 induced
apoptosis when combined with chemotherapy mainly in
SW620 (Supplementary Figure S2B).

Finally, to evaluate the effect of EC-70124 in vivo,
we implanted HT29 in mice and treated animals with
EC-70124 at a dose of 18 mg/kg i.v. every three days.
Figure 5B shows the anti-tumor effect of EC-70124
compared to control. The mean tumor volume (mm3)

treated and control groups (Figure 5C). In parallel we

seen in Figure 5D treatment with the drug reduced pS6
at different time points (30 and 60 min), confirming the
effect of this drug on this pathway. Finally, as can be
seen in Figure 5E, there was a clear accumulation of
the drug in the tumor at 30 min and 60 min, reaching
over 3000 ng/g, well above levels with anti-proliferative
activity in cell lines.

several relevant routes could have more antitumor activity
than drugs targeting single proteins.
Next we evaluated different compounds against
the most frequent phosphorylated kinases. We observed
how the novel multi-target kinase inhibitor EC-70124
showed a higher antitumor activity, compared with other
inhibitors. Biochemical evaluation of the mechanism
of action of EC-70124 showed that this drug inhi­
bited relevant routes including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway. Furthermore, EC-70124 inhibited SRC and
reduced migration of cancer cells. EC-70124 exerted its
antineoplastic action through an arrest in G2/M and an
induction of apoptosis, as indicated by accumulation of
PARP cleavage in SW620 [22].
Additional experiments demonstrated that EC70124 led to DNA damage. This was confirmed by
phosphorylation of γH2AX and chk2. γH2AX is
phosphorylated at sites of DNA damage and it is required
for the recruitment of multiple DNA repair proteins [23].
Similarly, after DNA damage chk2 is phosphorylated by
ATM/ATR kinases.
Most current therapeutic strategies in oncology
are based on drug combinations, therefore identification
of synergistic interactions between targeted agents and
chemotherapies is a main goal [24]. Therefore we decided
to evaluate EC-70124 in association with relevant drugs
used in the clinic including oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and
irinotecan. EC-70124 in combination with these drugs
showed a synergistic interaction in the cell lines studied.
We observed how the administration of these combinations
induced apoptosis particularly in SW620.
Finally, we observed that EC-70124 inhibited tumor
growth in xenografted mice demonstrating its efficacy in vivo.
Of note, a reduction of pS6 was also observed confirming the
effect of the drug on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR route.
In conclusion, in this study we describe the kinase
profile of human colorectal tumors, reporting some
druggable kinases and identifying a novel compound
against some of the activated proteins with clear
antineoplastic effect. EC-70124 induces cell cycle arrest
at G2/M and apoptosis. We identify combinations with
chemotherapies that have a synergistic effect and confirm
the activity in vivo. Globally, our data support the future
clinical development of this drug in this clinical setting.

DISCUSSION
Protein kinases are implicated in different cellular
functions linked with oncogenic transformation [13].
In solid tumors several of them are deregulated and
potentially druggable with kinase inhibitors [13, 14]. In
the present work we aimed to explore the kinase profile of
colon cancer using human samples. We observed several
activated proteins including the ErbB receptor family and
particularly EGFR, components of the PI3K/mTOR route
including AKT and pS6, and the JAK/STAT pathway
represented by STAT1, among others.
EGFR is a well known activated kinase in many
epithelial tumors including colorectal cancer [15]. Indeed,
strategies to inhibit this receptor with antibodies or
small tyrosine kinase inhibitors have reached the clinical
setting [15]. Examples are cetuximab or panitumumab
approved for several indications including colorectal or
head and neck tumors, or EGFR-directed small kinase
inhibitors in lung cancer [3, 15, 16]. As EGFR activates
downstream pathways such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR or
the MAPK route, we also explored key intermediates of
these nodes. In addition, activation of the PI3K/mTOR
pathway is associated with cancer and strategies aimed to
neutralize their activation are in clinical development in
different solid tumors [17, 18]. In our study we observed
the phosphorylation of S6 and AKT/Thr308 in a high
proportion of patients, showing the relevance of this route
in colorectal tumors.
Ongoing studies are evaluating agents against the
PI3K/mTOR route in combination with anti-EGFR antibodies
in colon cancer [19]. Interestingly, phosphorylation of
intermediates like AKT and S6 were less prominent in those
tumors with K-RAS mutations suggesting that strategies
against the PI3K/mTOR pathway should focus on K-RAS
wild type tumors. Indeed, our study confirm this strategy, that
has been incorporated in some clinical studies [19].
An interesting finding was the significant expression
of phosphorylated ALK and STAT1 in the analyzed human
samples. In colon cancer, rearrangements of ALK have
been previously described in a small proportion of tumors
[20] and the JAK/STAT pathway has been associated
with the initiation and maintenance of cells with stem cell
properties [21].
Of note, concomitant activation of several kinases
were observed within the same tumor. This is a remarkable
observation as suggests that drugs with activity against

Cell lines and drug compounds

MTT metabolization, three-dimensional cell
cultures and clonogenic assays

SW-620 cell line was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC; CCL-227) (Manassas, VA)
and HT-29 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. R. SánchezPrieto. These cells display several genetic alterations; SW620 carries mutation in Kras gene, whereas HT-29 has a
coexisting activating mutation in PIK3CA and BRAF. Cell
lines were maintained in RPMI (SW620) and DMEM (HT29) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), with 100 U/mL
penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 5 mM L-glutamine.
The cell culture medium and supplements were obtained
from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The multi-kinase
inhibitor EC-70124 was prepared via a proprietary process
with Entrechem S.L. (Oviedo, Spain). Chemotherapeutic
agents (Irinotecan, Oxaliplatin and 5-Fluorouracil) were
purchased from Selleckchem (Deltaclon, Madrid Spain).

Cell proliferation experiments were carried
out using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dipheny­
ltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, where MTT is
reduced to purple formazan by the mitochondria of living
cells. Increase in cell number is detected by augmented
MTT metabolization, and decrease in cell number is
reflected by decrease in MTT metabolization. SW620
and HT29 cells were plated at a density of 10,000 cells
per well in 48-multiwell plates and cultured overnight
in RPMI or DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and
5 mM glutamine The next day, cells were treated for
three days with increasing concentrations of EC-70124
alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics
to plot the dose–response curves and for synergy
studies, respectively. In parallel, cells were treated with
increasing amounts of EC-70124 at three-time points
(24 h, 48 h and 72 h of incubation) to determine the
IC50 value. After drug administration, the medium was
replaced with 400 μL of fresh medium DMEM without
phenol red containing MTT (0.5 μg/μL) and incubated
for 45 minutes at 37°C. The medium was then removed
and 200 μL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were added
to each well. The plate was agitated in the dark for
5 minutes to dissolve the MTT-formazan crystals. The
absorbance of the samples was recorded at 562 nm (555–
690) in a multiwell plate reader (BMG labtech). Results
were plotted as the mean values of quadruplicates from a
representative experiment that was repeated at least two
independent times.
To determine whether EC-70124 combined to
other chemotherapy drugs (Irinotecan, Oxaliplatin or
5-Fluorouracil) was synergistic, additive, or antagonist,
we used the CalcuSyn v2.0 software programme (Biosoft,
Ferguson, MO). This program allows the calculation of
the combination index based on the algorithm of Chou
and Talalay [12]. Combination index values greater than
1 indicate antagonism, less than 1 indicate synergism and
values equal to 1 indicate an additive effect. Combination
index values from three independent experiments were
generated.
For Matrigel-embedded cell culture experiments,
SW620 and HT-29 cells were grown in RPMI or DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM glutamine.
Following passage, cells were trypsinized (0.5 g porcine
trypsin and 0.2 g EDTA 4 Na, purchased from Sigma
Aldrich) and resuspended in growth medium containing
2% Matrigel. Then, cells were seeded at a density of
12,500 cells/ml in a 48-multiwell plate containing an
underlying approximately 1 mm thick bed of Matrigel
and incubated at 37°C. Next day, cells were treated with
EC-70124 and cultured for 7 days. The assay included the
daily visualization of cells under a light microscope to
monitor the phenotype.

Preparation of tumor homogenates and
phospho-kinase antibody arrays
The tumor samples of patients were minced,
washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer (PBS), and
homogenized in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer containing 10X
protease and phosphate inhibitor cocktails (1.5 ml/100 mg of
tumour). These homogenates were centrifuged at 10000 g for
10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were transferred to new
tubes. For preparation of EC-70124 treated and non-treated
cell extracts, cell cultures were washed with cold PBS and
lysed in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer containing 1X protease and
phosphate inhibitor cocktails. Then, insoluble material was
removed by centrifugation. The protein concentration of tumor
homogenates and cell lines extracts was determined using
BCA (Bicinchoninic acid) protein assay kit (Sigma Aldrich).
The phosphorylation status of a wide range of
Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) and downstream
signaling nodes was evaluated in both colon cancer
tissues and EC-70124-treated and non-treated cell lines.
For these studies, two commercial arrays were used;
the human phospho-RTK array kit (# ARY001, R&D
Systems, Abingdon, UK) and the PathScan RTK Signaling
Antibody Array Kit (# 7982,Cell Signaling Technology).
According to the manufacturer’s instructions, antibody
array membranes were incubated with 1,5 mg and
150  μg of protein lysates, respectively. Quantification
of the different RTKs and cell signaling intermediates in
the membranes was performed using the Quantity One
analysis software (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) and expressed
as the pixel density (OD/mm2). The pixel density of the
background was subtracted from the pixel density of each
spot, and the average of duplicate spots was determined.
Next, normalized signal intensity was calculated by
dividing the mean value of pixel density in each spot by
the mean value of pixel density in the positive control.
Significance was determined using a cut-off point of
density signal higher than 0.6.

For clonogenic experiments cell were seeded at a
density of 500,000 cells in a 100 mm culture dishes, and
treated, the next day, with EC-70124 (500 nM), Irinotecan,
Oxaliplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, EC-70124 + Irinotecan, EC70124 + Oxaliplatin and EC-70124 + 5-Fluorouracil. After
24-hours treatment, cells were trypsinized, resuspended
in 5 ml of complete growth medium to perform serial
dilutions 1/10 and seeded, in triplicate, in 6-multiwell
plates for 10 days. Then, the medium was removed and
the number of colonies were determined.

then treated with 500 nM of EC-70124 for 24 hours. After
drug treatment, cells were trypsinized, fixed in ice cold 70%
ethanol for 30 minutes and subsequently centrifuged at
6000 rpm for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were washed in PBS +
2% BSA and treated with Propidium iodide/RNAse staining
solution (Immunostep S.L., Salamanca, Spain) in the dark
for 1 hour at 4°C, and analyzed then on FACSCanto II
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The percentage of each
cell cycle phase was determined by plotting DNA content
against cell number using the FACS Diva software.
For apoptosis analyses, SW620 and HT29 cell
monolayers were incubated in trypsin–EDTA, washed
twice with cold PBS, and then resuspended in Annexin V
binding buffer (Immunostep S.L., Salamanca, Spain) at a
concentration of 1 × 106 cells per mL. A total of 3 × 105
cells were incubated for 1 hour in the dark with Annexin
V (Immunostep) and PI staining solution (5 μL Annexin
V-DY-634, 3 μL of PI [10 mg/ml final concentration],
400  μL binding buffer). The apoptotic cells were
determined using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences). Both early apoptotic (Annexin V-positive,
PI-negative) and late (Annexin V-positive and PI-positive)
apoptotic cells were included in cell death determinations.

Cell migration study
SW620 and HT-29 cells were plated at a density
of 200.000 cells/60 mm dish and maintained overnight
in RPMI + 10% FBS + 2 mM glutamine. Following
incubation, culture medium was removed and a wound in
the cell monolayers was generated by scratching with a
200-μl pipette tip. Photographs were taken of the initial
wound for comparison. Then, DMEM + 10% FBS was
added and cells were treated for 48 hours with either 300 nM
EC-70124 or 100 nM Dasatinib, as a negative control.
Cell migration was visualized at x10 magnification and
photographed. Each experiment was completed in duplicate.

In vivo studies

Western blotting

Animal care complied with the Principles of
Laboratory Animal Care and Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals. HT-29 human colon carcinoma
cells (5 × 106 cells in 100 μl of DMEM with 20% Matrigel)
were injected subcutaneously through a 23-gauge needle
into the back of female BALB/cAnNR1-Fox1 nu/Fox
1 nu mice (5 weeks old, body weight ~ 18 g) obtained
from Janvier Labs. Mice were randomly divided into two
groups: (i) drug treatment group (n = 5) and (ii) control
group (n = 5). Once tumors reached a volume of 100 mm3,
animals were inhalatorily anaesthetized and treated with
either EC-70124 i.v (18 mg/kg) or vehicle i.v. (following
manufactures instructions) at intervals of 3 to 4 days. Tumor
diameters were recorded every 3–4 days. The results are
expressed as tumor volumen, which were calculated using
the following formula: V = (L × W2)/2, where V = volume
(cubic millimeters), L = length (millimeters) and W = width
(millimeters). Mice were killed by CO2 inhalation.

For Western-blotting, 50 μg of total protein from
cell lysates was boiled and resolved by 6%–15% sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE), depending on the molecular weight of the proteins
to be analyzed. After electrophoresis, proteins in gels
were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Millipore Corporation). Blots were blocked in 1x Trisbuffered saline (TBS,100 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM
NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and 1% of bovine serum albumin
for 1 hour and then incubated overnight with the following
primary human monoclonal/policlonal antibodies: anti-AKT,
anti-pS473-AKT, anti-pH2AX, anti-pCHK2 (BD Biosciences),
anti-ERK1/2, anti-pERK1/2, anti-PARP-1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-pS6, anti-pT308-AKT (Cell Signalling
Technology), anti-Src (Cell Signalling Technology). Proteinbound primary antibodies were detected using respective
horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies
(anti-rabbit for polyclonal and anti-mouse for monoclonal,
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:5,000 in
1x TBS containing 0.05% Tween and incubated for 1 hour at
room temperature. Protein bands were detected using ECL
Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).
