ABSTRACT
Radiation therapy is a staple treatment for pancreatic cancer. However, owing
to the intrinsic radioresistance of pancreatic cancer cells, radiation therapy often
fails to increase survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Radiation impedes cancer
cells by inducing DNA damage, which can activate cell cycle checkpoints. Normal
cells possess both a G1 and G2 checkpoint. However, cancer cells are often defective
in G1 checkpoint due to mutations/alterations in key regulators of this checkpoint.
Accordingly, our results show that normal pancreatic ductal cells respond to ionizing
radiation (IR) with activation of both checkpoints whereas pancreatic cancer cells
respond to IR with G2/M arrest only. Overexpression/hyperactivation of Rac1
GTPase is detected in the majority of pancreatic cancers. Rac1 plays important roles
in survival and Ras-mediated transformation. Here, we show that Rac1 also plays
a critical role in the response of pancreatic cancer cells to IR. Inhibition of Rac1
using specific inhibitor and dominant negative Rac1 mutant not only abrogates
IR-induced G2 checkpoint activation, but also increases radiosensitivity of pancreatic
cancer cells through induction of apoptosis. These results implicate Rac1 signaling
in the survival of pancreatic cancer cells following IR, raising the possibility that this
pathway contributes to the intrinsic radioresistance of pancreatic cancer.

the efficacy of radiation therapy in pancreatic cancer
patients.
The ionizing radiation (IR) delivered by radiation
therapy impedes cancer cells mainly by the production of
DNA damage. In response to IR-induced DNA damage,
human cells will engage several protective mechanisms
that promote DNA repair and survival [23]. Among these
is the activation of cell cycle checkpoints that block cell
cycle progression to allow time for DNA repair [24].
Depending on the phase of the cell cycle at which the
damage is sensed, cells can activate either a G1 or G2
checkpoint, to respectively block the cell cycle at the G1/S

INTRODUCTION
Radiation therapy is a staple treatment for pancreatic
cancer patients, especially for those with locally advanced
or borderline resectable disease [1, 2]. However, for the
vast majority of pancreatic cancer patients, radiation
therapy still fails to significantly increase survival or
improve quality of life [3]. This lack of efficacy is
primarily due to the intrinsic radioresistance of pancreatic
cancer cells, as only 12–40% of pancreatic tumors exhibit
an objective response to radiation therapy [4–22]. Thus,
there is an urgent need to develop strategies for increasing

or G2/M border [24]. In cells that possess dysfunctional
cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis can instead occur to
eliminate the damaged cells [25]. Normal cells have
both a G1 and G2 cell cycle checkpoint to maintain their
genomic integrity [26]. However, most cancer cells lack
a functional G1 checkpoint, due to mutations/alterations
in key regulators of the G1 checkpoint (e.g. p53, p16, and
Cdk4) [26, 27]. For this reason, cancer cells are much
more reliant on the functionality of the G2 checkpoint for
their survival after radiation therapy.
The G2 checkpoint is tightly controlled by the Cdc2/
Cyclin B complex, whose activity is required for the G2/M
transition of the cell cycle [28]. Previous studies identify
the Y15 residue of Cdc2 as a critical site in G2 checkpoint
response to IR. Phosphorylation of Cdc2-Y15 following
IR results in Cdc2 inhibition, leading to cell cycle arrest
at the G2/M border [29–31]. Cdc2-Y15 is phosphorylated
by the Wee1 and Myt1 kinases and dephosphorylated by
Cdc25 dual-specificity phosphatases [32–34].
In response to IR exposure, ATM and ATR kinases
are rapidly activated through phosphorylation, which,
in turn, leads to the phosphorylation/activation of their
respective downstream targets, the Chk1 and Chk2 kinases.
Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylate the Cdc25 phosphatases,
resulting in the subcellular sequestration, degradation and/
or inhibition of Cdc25, which normally activate Cdc2/
Cyclin B complex at the G2/M boundary [35].
Cell cycle transition from G2 to mitotic phase
requires histone H3 phosphorylation, which is associated
with chromosome condensation prior to cell division [36].
Since both G2 and mitotic cells contain 4N-DNA content
and are undistinguishable from each other by DNA content
analysis, H3-Ser10 phosphorylation is commonly used as
a marker of mitotic cells within the 4N population [37].
Histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation begins in late G2 on
the pericentromeric chromatin. As cells progress through
mitosis, this phosphorylation has spread to the remaining
chromatin by the end of prophase [38, 39]. Thus, there
is a gradual increase in H3-Ser10 phosphorylation from
the beginning to the end of mitosis. In a wide range of
exponentially growing cells, H3-Ser10 phosphorylation in
mitotic cells can be detected by flow cytometry analysis
[40, 41]. Upon G2 checkpoint activation, H3-Ser10
phosphorylation is inhibited due to blockage of the G2/M
transition of the cell cycle [28, 40, 41].
Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1)
is a member of the Rho family of small guanosine
triphosphatases (GTPases). Rac1 has been shown to play a
critical role in cytoskeleton reorganization, cell migration
and cell survival [42]. Rac1 exists in either an active
GTP-bound state or inactive GDP-bound state [43]. The
transition of Rac1 between these two states is regulated
by its GEFs (Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors) and
GAPs (GTPase–activating proteins). While GEFs promote
Rac1 activation by accelerating GDP/GTP exchange, GAPs
terminate Rac1 activity by promoting GTP hydrolysis [43].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In its active state, Rac1 interacts with its effectors, thereby
activating numerous downstream signaling pathways
[44,  45]. Overexpression/hyperactivation of Rac1 has
been detected in the great majority of pancreatic cancers
[46, 47]. Rac1 and two of its GEFs, Tiam1 and Vav1,
have been reported to be overexpressed in more than
70% of pancreatic cancers, and Vav1 overexpression has
also been associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic
cancer patients [46–49]. Rac1 signaling has been shown to
promote cellular transformation and to protect cells from
apoptosis [43, 49].
While Rac1 is primarily localized at the cell
membrane, it is also detected in the nucleus and the amount
of nuclear Rac1 is increased in the late G2 phase [50].
Rac1 has been reported to activate ERK1/2 signaling via
p21-activated kinase 1 and 2, which phosphorylate Raf1
and MEK1 and facilitates the formation of the Raf/MEK/
ERK complex [51–53]. A role for Rac1 in the activation of
PI3K/AKT pro-survival signaling has also been reported
[54, 55] and Rac1 is necessary for the activation of AKT by
UV and sphingosine 1-phosphate [56, 57]. Both AKT and
ERK1/2 signaling pathways have been shown to promote
cell survival after IR [23, 41, 58–62]. We recently reported
a new function for Rac1 in the regulation of breast cancer
cells’ response to IR [63]. Our results revealed that Rac1 is
rapidly activated in breast cancer cells after IR and that this
activation is required for the activation of the G2 checkpoint
response by IR and for cell survival following IR [63]. In the
present study, we have investigated the role of Rac1 in the
response of human pancreatic cancer cells to IR. Results in
this report demonstrate that the inhibition of Rac1 sensitizes
human pancreatic cancer cells to IR by a mechanism that
involves G2 checkpoint abrogation and apoptosis induction.

RESULTS
IR exposure induces G2/M arrest and Cdc2
inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells
To determine the response of pancreatic
cancer
cells
to
IR,
exponentially
growing
pancreatic cancer cells were exposed to IR at the
indicated doses and analyzed for DNA content by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) at 24 h
following IR. As shown in Fig. 1A, IR exposure of CD-18/
HPAF cells resulted in a marked increase in the amount of
4N-DNA content cells, indicative of G2/M phases of the
cell cycle [28], and concomitant decreases in the amount
of cells in G1 and S phases. Similarly, IR exposure of
AsPC-1 and Capan-1 pancreatic cancer cells also resulted
in a dose-dependent accumulation of G2/M phase cells,
which was also associated with concomitant decreases
in the amount of cells at G1 and S phases (Fig.  1B).
These results indicate that these pancreatic cancer cells
respond to IR exposure with a G2/M cell cycle arrest.

This observation is consistent with the previous finding
that most cancer cells possess a functional G2 checkpoint
but are defective in G1 checkpoint [26, 27].
The G2 checkpoint activation requires inhibition of
Cdc2, whose activity is required for G2/M transition of
the cell cycle [28]. We next assessed changes in Cdc2-Y15
phosphorylation, indicative of Cdc2 inhibition, following
IR exposure of pancreatic cancer cells. As shown in
Fig. 1C, IR exposure resulted in a time-dependent increase
in Cdc2-Y15 phosphorylation in AsPC-1, CD18/HPAF
and Capan-1 pancreatic cancer cells, with the initial
increase observed within 30 min following IR.
We also tested the response of normal human
pancreatic ductal cells (HPNE) to IR. HPNE is a line of
primary human pancreatic ductal cells immortalized with
the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT) [64].
As shown in Fig. 1D, the majority of log-phase growing
HPNE cells possessed 2N-DNA content, indicative of

cells in G1 phase [65]. Following IR, cells in S phase
were depleted as the amount of cells in both G1 and G2/M
phases increased (Fig. 1D). This result indicates there
were activations of both G1 and G2 checkpoints in HPNE
cells following IR. Taken together, these results reveal
a fundamental difference in cell cycle response to IR
between normal and cancer cells. The normal pancreatic
ductal cells have a G1 checkpoint response to IR that their
cancer counterparts have lost.

Rac1 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells
Overexpression/hyperactivation of Rac1 in pancreatic
cancer cells has been reported and Rac1 plays an important
role in cell survival and transformation [47, 56, 66, 67]. To
examine the role of Rac1 in the cellular response to IR, we
analyzed Rac1 protein expression in HPNE and pancreatic
cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the pancreatic cancer

cells expressed much higher levels of Rac1 than HPNE
primary human pancreatic ductal cells. Consistently, Rac1
activity assay demonstrated an association between Rac1
protein level and Rac1 activity in these cells, showing that
much higher Rac1 activities were detected in AsPC-1,
CD18/HPAF and Capan-1 pancreatic cancer cells compared
to HPNE cells (Fig. 2B). We also assessed the pancreatic
cancer cells for changes in Rac1 level and activity following
IR. As shown in Fig.  2C, no noticeable change in Rac1
activity was detected after IR exposure of the cancer cells.
These results indicate there is a marked increase in Rac1
level and activity in the pancreatic cancer cells relative
to primary pancreatic ductal cells. In addition, this high
level of Rac1 activity in the pancreatic cancer cells was
unaffected by IR.

Using the Rac1 specific inhibitor NSC23766 [68], we
examined the effect of Rac1 on IR-induced G2/M arrest in
pancreatic cancer cells. For these experiments, pancreatic
cancer cells (AsPC-1, Capan-1 and CD18/HPAF) were
incubated with increasing doses of NSC23766 and
exposed to IR. As shown in Fig. 3A, incubation of AsPC-1
cells with NSC23766 at 100 and 200 μM resulted in
62% and 83% inhibition of Rac1 activity, respectively,
compared to control untreated cells (Rac1-GTP). As
shown in Figs. 3B and 3C, incubation of AsPC-1 cells in
the presence of 100 μM NSC23766 resulted in a marked
attenuation in the induction of G2/M arrest following

Figure 3: Rac1 inhibition abrogates IR-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in pancreatic cancer cells. (A) AsPC-1 cells were

for DNA content by FACS. Results depict the percentage of cells with 4N-DNA content (G2/M phase) and represent the mean±S.D. of two

the absence of IR only had subtle, if any, effect on the
percentage of 4N-DNA content cells relative to log-phase
growing cells (Fig. 3B, NSC). Incubation of AsPC-1 cells
with NSC23766 also resulted in a slight decrease in the
amount of G1 phase cells and a minor increase, if any, in
the amount of S phase cells (Fig. 3B, NSC). Furthermore,
incubation with 100 μM NSC23766 also abrogated the

As additional controls, the indicated pancreatic cancer
cells were treated with ABT-888, a poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP1/2) inhibitor [69], or MK-1775,
a Wee1 kinase inhibitor [70] and then exposed to IR.
While PARP1/2 plays an essential role in the repair of
single-stranded DNA breaks, Wee1 inhibits Cdc2 kinase
by phosphorylation of the Y15 residue of Cdc2 [71, 72].

in Fig. 3C, incubation with MK-1775 completely abrogated
the IR-induced G2/M arrest in the pancreatic cancer
cells, whereas incubation with ABT-888 did not block the
induction of G2/M arrest after IR.
As an additional control, we also investigated
the effects of Rac1 inhibition on the response of HPNE
primary pancreatic ductal cells to IR. As shown in Fig. 3D,
Rac1 inhibition by NSC23766 had little effects on the
IR-induced cell cycle response of HPNE cells.

Using histone-H3 phosphorylation as a marker of
mitotic cells [73], we examined the effect of Rac1 on the
proportion of cells in mitosis following IR exposure. As
shown in Fig. 4, IR exposure resulted in a rapid decrease
in the proportion of mitotic cells in CD18/HPAF cells. At
2 h post IR, there was an approximately 90% decrease
in mitotic cells relative to non-irradiated control cells
(Fig. 4A: IR vs. None; Fig. 4B: black bars). In contrast,
incubation of cells with NSC23766 blocked the effect of
IR, resulting in a significant increase in the proportion of

mitotic cells in irradiated cells compared to the control
irradiated cells incubated in the absence of NSC23766
(Fig. 4A: IR+NSC vs. IR; Fig. 4B: IR). Incubation of cells
with NSC23766 alone resulted in only a slight increase
in the amount of mitotic cells compared to the control
untreated cells (Fig. 4A: NSC vs. None; Fig. 4B: None).

pre-incubation of CD18/HPAF cells with NSC23766
resulted in a dose-dependent diminution of IR-induced
activation of ATM and ATR kinase activities. A complete
inhibition of both IR-induced ATM and ATR activities was
achieved in cells incubated with 100 μM NSC23766 and
exposed to IR.
To confirm the effect of Rac1 inhibition on IR-induced
activation of ATM and ATR kinases, we analyzed Chk1 and
Chk2 activities in CD18/HPAF cells following IR exposure
with or without the presence of NSC23766. As shown in
Fig. 5B, while IR induced activation of both Chk1 and
Chk2 in CD18/HPAF cells, the effect was dose-dependently
blocked by the inhibition of Rac1. Consistent with the effect
of NSC23766 on the IR-induced ATM and ATR, presence of

Ectopic expression of dominant negative
N17Rac1 mutant blocks G2/M checkpoint
activation following IR

100 μM NSC23766 completely abrogated the IR-induced
Chk1 and Chk2 activation in CD18/HPAF cells (Fig. 5B,
Chk1 activity and Chk2 activity).
Activity of the Cdc2/Cyclin B complex is essential
for the cells to progress from G2 to M phase of the cell
cycle [74]. Activation of ATM and ATR signaling following
IR leads to the induction of Cdc2-Y15 phosphorylation
that inhibits Cdc2 activity [75]. We therefore examined
the effect of Rac1 inhibition on the IR-induced Cdc2-Y15
phosphorylation in CD18/HPAF cells. As shown in Fig. 5C,
IR-induced Cdc2-Y15 phosphorylation was inhibited dosedependently by the presence of NSC23766. Consistently,
incubation with 100 μM NSC23766, a dose that abrogated
the activation of ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 following IR,
also inhibited the induction of Cdc2-Y15 phosphorylation
in CD18/HPAF cells after IR (Fig. 5C).
Collectively, results in Fig. 5 indicate that Rac1
inhibition by NSC23766 abolished the IR-induced
activation of ATM and ATR signaling pathways, which
play key roles in the regulation of G2 checkpoint response.

Using an adenoviral vector expressing N17Rac1,
a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 [76], we verified
the effect of Rac1 inhibition on the IR-induced G2/M
checkpoint response in CD18/HPAF cells. For these
studies, the cells were transduced with adenoviral
vector expressing N17Rac1 (Ad.N17Rac1) or control
empty vector (Ad.Control). As shown in Fig. 6A (upper
panel), immunoblotting analysis detected the ectopically
expressed N17Rac1, which migrates slightly slower than
the endogenous wild-type Rac1. We next examined the
effect of N17Rac1 mutant on IR-induced G2/M arrest. As
shown in Fig. 6A (lower panel), DNA-content analyses
revealed a marked induction in IR-induced G2/M arrest in
the control vector transduced CD18/HPAF cells and that
this induction was blocked significantly by the expression
of N17Rac1 (p<0.001, n=4).

immunoblotting. GAPDH protein in the cell lysates was assessed by Western blotting as a protein loading control.

Inhibition of Rac1 sensitizes pancreatic cancer
cells to IR exposure

We next examined the effect of N17Rac1 expression
on the activation of Chk1 and Chk2 following IR. As
shown in Fig. 6B, while control vector-transduced CD18/
HPAF cells showed a noticeable activation of both Chk1
and Chk2 kinases after IR, N17Rac1-transduced cells
exhibited a marked diminution in the activation of Chk1
and Chk2 following IR compared to the control vectortransduced cells (Chk1 activity and Chk2 activity). In
addition, N17Rac1 expression also resulted in a slight
decrease in basal Chk1 activity in the un-irradiated cells
(Fig. 6B). Transduction of CD18/HPAF cells with control
vector had no noticeable effect on IR-induced activation
of Chk1 and Chk2 compared to un-transduced cells (data
not shown).

Results in Figs. 1–6 showed that the IR-induced
G2/M checkpoint activation in human pancreatic cancer
cells was abrogated by the Rac1 specific inhibitor
NSC23766 and by expression of the N17Rac1 mutant.
We next examined the effect of Rac1 inhibition on cell
survival after IR using a clonogenic assay. As shown in
Figs. 7A and 7B, while IR exposure alone resulted in only
a small decrease in clonogenic survival of CD18/HPAF
cells, IR exposure in the presence of NSC23766 resulted
in a striking decrease in clonogenic survival of these
cells. In the presence of NSC23766, cell viability after

survival relative to the untreated control cells. However,
the NSC23766 treated cells appeared to form larger
colonies compared to the untreated control cells (Fig. 7A,
0 Gy: Control vs. NSC). We also tested the effect of Rac1
inhibition on the viability of irradiated HPNE normal
cells, which express a much lower level of Rac1 protein
relative to CD18/HPAF pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 2). As
shown in Fig. 7C, inhibition of Rac1 by NSC23766 had

survival following IR, we transduced CD18/HPAF
pancreatic cancer cells and HPNE normal cells with
Ad.N17Rac1 or Ad.Control viruses and exposed the
cells to IR. Results in Fig. 7D (upper panels) confirmed

the presence of ectopic N17Rac1 expression in the
Ad.N17rac1-transduced CD18/HPAF and HPNE cells.
As shown in Fig. 7D (lower left panel), expression
of N17Rac1 in the absence of IR resulted in visible
morphological changes in the CD18/HPAF cells
compared to the control-infected cells. At 2 days
following IR, N17Rac1-expressing CD18/HPAF cells
had rounded up and had detached from the culture dish
(Fig. 7D, lower left panel, N17Rac1 + IR), whereas
Ad.Control-infected CD18/HPAF cells remained attached
and showed little change in cell morphology compared
to the unirradiated Ad.Control-infected cells (Fig. 7D,
lower left panel, Control + IR vs. Control + None). In
contrast, in HPNE cells, neither N17Rac1 expression nor
IR produced any noticeable changes in cell morphology
(Fig. 7D, lower right panel). In both cell lines, control
viral infection had little effect on cell morphology relative
to their respective uninfected cells (Fig. 7D, lower panels:
Control vs. None).

In summary, the results of these studies indicate that
the inhibition of Rac1, either by NSC23766 or expression
of N17Rac1, augments the sensitivity of CD18/HPAF
pancreatic cancer cells to IR, whereas it has little effect on
the sensitivity of HPNE normal cells to IR.

the presence of activated caspase 3 (p20), indicative of
apoptosis induction, in both the AsPC-1 and CD18/HPAF
cells treated with NSC23766. In contrast, no evidence
of caspase 3 activation was detected in the cells treated
with either NSC23766 alone or IR alone (Fig. 8A, upper
and middle panels). For a comparison, we also assessed
caspase 3 activation in HPNE normal cells treated with
IR and/or NSC23766. As shown in Fig. 8A (lower panel),
no evidence of caspase 3 activation was detected in any
of the HPNE samples, whether treated with IR and/or
NSC23766. In contrast, the activated caspase 3 was readily
detected in the positive control, AsPC-1 cells treated with
both NSC23766 and IR.
To verify the effect of Rac1 inhibition on caspase
3 activation following IR, CD18/HPAF, AsPC-1 and
HPNE cells were transduced with N17Rac1 or control
viral vector and exposed to IR. As shown in Fig. 8B,

Rac1 inhibition results in apoptosis induction
in pancreatic cancer cells exposed to IR
To investigate the possible mechanisms involved in
the increase in radiation sensitivity in pancreatic cancer
cells by Rac1 inhibition, we assessed the treated cells for
markers of apoptosis induction. It has been previously
demonstrated that the activation of caspase 3, a hallmark
of apoptosis induction, occurs during the execution phase
of apoptosis [77]. As shown in Fig. 8A (upper and middle
panels), at 2 days after IR, immunoblotting detected

activation of caspase 3 was detected in both the CD18/
HPAF and AsPC-1 cells transduced with N17Rac1 and
exposed to IR, but not in the control viral vector infected
cells exposed to IR. Expression of N17Rac1 by itself also
resulted in a detectable but limited caspase 3 activation
in CD18/HPAF cells (Fig. 8B, upper panel). But in
AsPC-1 cells, N17Rac1 by itself did not lead to caspase
3 activation (Fig. 8B, middle panel). In contrast, ectopic
N17Rac1 expression did not cause caspase 3 activation in
HPNE cells, either with or without IR (Fig. 8B, bottom
panel). Thus, the effect of N17Rac1 on the induction of
apoptosis following IR appears to be cancer specific, as
the pancreatic cancer cell lines were more susceptible to
this effect than HPNE cells.
In summary, results of these studies indicate that
the inhibition of Rac1 using either pharmacological
inhibitor or dominant negative mutant promotes apoptosis
induction after IR in pancreatic cancer cells. However,
Rac1 inhibition has little effect on the survival of normal
pancreatic ductal cells following IR.

indicative of AKT activation, was detected in CD18/
HPAF cells following IR, this effect of IR was diminished
in the cells incubated with Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766.
In contrast, the IR-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
indicative of ERK1/2 activation, was unaffected by the
incubation of CD18/HPAF cells with NSC23766 (Fig. 9A,
pERK1/2). Treatment with IR and/or NSC23766 had no
detectable effect on the overall levels of AKT and ERK1/2
proteins (Fig. 9A, AKT and ERK1/2).
The effect of Rac1 on IR-induced activation of
AKT and ERK1/2 was also examined using N17Rac1
mutant. As shown in Fig. 9B, ectopic expression of
N17Rac1 in CD18/HPAF cells resulted in a significant
diminution of IR-induced AKT phosphorylation (pAKT),
whereas it did not block the increase of ERK1/2
phosphorylation following IR (pERK1/2). This result is
consistent with the effect of Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766,
suggesting that Rac1 plays an essential role in the IRinduced AKT activation in CD18/HPAF pancreatic
cancer cells whereas it has little effect on the IR-induced
ERK1/2 activation in these cells.

Rac1 inhibition abolishes IR-induced AKT
activation in pancreatic cancer cells

DISCUSSION

Both AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways have
been shown to promote cell survival in response to
radiation [23]. Since Rac1 has been shown to activate AKT
and ERK1/2 in response to various stimuli [56, 57, 78, 79],
we tested the effect of Rac1 inhibition on the IR induced
activation of AKT and ERK1/2. As shown in Fig.  9A,
while a marked increase in AKT phosphorylation (pAKT),

Rac1 is constitutively activated in the great
majority of pancreatic cancers and contributes critically
to the development and maintenance of pancreatic cancer
[46, 47]. Rac1 and two of its GEFs, Tiam1 and Vav1, are
overexpressed in more than 70% of pancreatic cancers
[46–48]. We also observe in the present study a striking
up-regulation of Rac1 level/activity in cancerous versus

normal pancreatic cells (see Fig. 2). The Rac1 signaling
pathway is required for transformation mediated by the
Ras oncogene [80–83] and, in the mouse K-RasG12D knockin model of pancreatic cancer, Rac1 is required for the
development of tumors [84, 85]. The pathway promotes
transformation, protects from apoptosis, and promotes
motility and invasion [46, 48, 84, 86]. In this report, we
provide evidence that the Rac1 pathway also plays an
essential role in the response of pancreatic cancer cells
to IR. Our results suggest that the hyperactivation of
this pathway protects pancreatic cancer cells from the
deleterious effects of radiotherapy.
We have recently identified the Rac1 signaling
pathway as an important regulator of the response of
breast cancer cells to IR [63]. In breast cancer cells, Rac1
is activated by IR and the inhibition of Rac1 abrogates
G2 checkpoint activation and cell survival following IR.
In the present report, we uncovered a similar role played
by Rac1 in pancreatic cancer cells. Pancreatic cancer
cells are notoriously resistant to the toxicity of radiation
therapy. Nonetheless, inhibition of Rac1 in pancreatic
cancer cells with a specific inhibitor or a dominant
negative mutant of Rac1 is sufficient to abrogate the
IR-induced G2 checkpoint activation, as evidenced by cell
cycle analyses, histone H3 phosphorylation, and activity
assessments of ATR/Chk1 and ATM/Chk2 kinases (see
Fig. 3–6). The inhibition of Rac1 also abrogates the
IR-induced AKT activation, which plays an important
role in antagonizing apoptosis induction. The net effect
of these alterations caused by Rac1 inhibition is a marked
increase in radiosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells,
as demonstrated by caspase 3 activation, production of
floating cells and the results of clonogenic survival assays
(see Fig. 7–8). These results reveal an important role for
Rac1 pathway in protecting pancreatic cancer cells from
the cytotoxic effects of IR. The data raises the possibility
that the intrinsic radioresistance of pancreatic cancer cells
might be a consequence of the constitutive activation of
the Rac1 pathway in this disease. Further studies will
be needed to test this possibility and to decipher the
mechanisms involved, as well as relative contributions
of G2 checkpoint abrogation and AKT inhibition to the
radiosensitizing activities of Rac1 inhibitors.
Activation of AKT and ERK1/2 signaling
pathways following IR has been associated with cell
survival after IR [87, 88]. It has also been shown
that Rac1 is necessary for PI3K/AKT activation by
lipopolysaccharides and MEK/ERK activation by
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate [79, 89]. These
reports initially led to our hypothesis that both AKT
and ERK1/2 were downstream targets of Rac1 in the
response of pancreatic cancer cells to IR. However,
although IR induces activation of both AKT and ERK1/2
in CD-18/HPAF cells, inhibition of Rac1 abrogates
only the AKT activation after IR but not the IR-induced

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ERK1/2 activation (see Fig. 9). These results suggest an
involvement of AKT but not ERK1/2 in the survival of
pancreatic cancer cells following IR. We will investigate
the regulation of IR-induced AKT signaling by Rac1 in
future studies.
A common pitfall of radiation therapy in pancreatic
cancer patients is the proximity of critical structures,
including healthy pancreas, surrounding blood vessels,
and gastric epithelium. To be valuable in the clinic, an
ideal radiosensitizer should selectively sensitize cancer
cells and leave normal cells unaffected. To address this
issue, we have compared the response of pancreatic
cancer cells to IR and Rac1 inhibition with that of normal
pancreatic ductal cells. Our results indicate that Rac1
inhibition only has little effects on the response of the
normal cells to IR. Most significantly, survival of normal
pancreatic ductal cells following IR is only marginally
affected by the inhibition of Rac1, in stark contrast with
the radiosensitization observed in the pancreatic cancer
cell lines. The mechanisms responsible for the differential
effects of Rac1 inhibitors are unknown. Two major
differences between normal and cancer cells may play
a role in this differential response to IR. First, there is a
marked difference in Rac1 activity between the normal
pancreatic ductal cells and pancreatic cancer cells (see
Fig. 2). The high Rac1 activity in the pancreatic cancer
cells may make these cells more dependent on Rac1
for survival. Second, most cancer cells have a defective
G1 checkpoint made dysfunctional by mutations in
regulators of the G1/S transition (K-Ras, p16 and p53,
etc.) [90], thereby making these cells more reliant on
the G2 checkpoint for radioprotection. Our data show
that the inhibition of Rac1 abrogates the IR-induced G2
checkpoint activation in the pancreatic cancer cells (see
Fig. 3–6) but only has subtle, if any, effect on the IRinduced G1 and G2 checkpoint responses of the normal
HPNE cells (see Fig. 3D). Additional experiments done
in vivo using mouse models will be needed to assess the
selectivity of Rac1 inhibitors and identify the mechanisms
responsible for this selectively.
Radiation therapy is a staple cancer treatment
approach, but its efficacy is still limited by the intrinsic
radioresistance of pancreatic cancer cells. Radiation
impedes cancer cell growth by inducing cytotoxicity,
mainly caused by DNA damage. However, radiation can
also simultaneously induce multiple signaling pathways
that promote cell survival, such as those mediated by
AKT, ATM/ATR and ERK. The pro-survival signaling
pathways generally lead to suppression of apoptosis,
activation of cell cycle checkpoint and initiation of DNA
repair. These signaling pathways act conjointly to reduce
the magnitude of radiation-induced cytotoxicity and
promote radioresistance in cancer cells. Results in this
report provide evidence supporting a novel function for
Rac1 in the survival of pancreatic cancer cells after IR,

which include the roles of Rac1 in the activation of G2/M
checkpoint response and in the suppression of apoptosis
induction following IR. Thus, a better understanding of
the mechanisms that promote survival following IR would
potentially allow for the identification of novel therapeutic
targets to be explored for radiosensitization of pancreatic
cancer cells.

fusion proteins were purified as described previously
[41]. GST was used as a control substrate in all kinase
assays and was prepared according to standard procedures
(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ).

Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and
kinase assay

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and  kinase
assays were performed as described previously
[41, 91, 92]. Specific protein signals on Western blots were
visualized by chemiluminescence exposed to x-ray film,
scanned using EPSON Perfection 4490PHOTO scanner
and analyzed using the ImageJ analytical program (NIH,
Bethesda, MD).

Cell culture and treatment
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines CD18/HPAF,
AsPC-1, Capan-1 and L3.6pl were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and
maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum. HPNE cells are
primary human pancreatic ductal cells immortalized using
hTERT, the catalytic subunit of human telomerase [64].
HPNE cells were maintained in Medium D medium,
which contains 3 parts of high glucose DMEM (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 1 part of M3F (INCELL,
San Antonio, TX), 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 ng/ml
recombinant EGF(Life Technologies [64].
Rac1 specific inhibitor NSC23766 [68], was
obtained from Tocris Biosciences (Ellisville, MO)
and dissolved in water. For experiments involving IR
exposure, exponentially growing cells were treated with
IR and then incubated at 37oC for the indicated time prior
to analysis. For experiments involving treatment with both
NSC23766 and IR, cells were incubated with NSC23766
for 1 hour prior to IR exposure.

Rac1 activity assay
Rac1 activity was assayed using a Rac1 assay kit
(Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), as described
previously [93, 94]. Briefly, cells were lysed at 4ºC in
25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM MgCl2,
150 mM NaCL, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 2% glycerol, 1
mM DTT, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml
pepstatin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1mM
sodium fluoride, and 1 mM sodium vanadate. Cell lysates
were incubated with agarose beads coated with the
GST-PAK1 fusion protein for 1 h to capture GTP-bound
Rac1. The obtained GTP-bound Rac1 (Rac1-GTP)
was resolved on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE and assessed by
immunoblotting using an anti-Rac1 antibody, as described
by the manufacturer’s instruction. As a negative control,
AsPC1 cell lysates were incubated with 1 mM GDP
at 30oC for 15 min and analyzed for Rac1 activity as
instructed by the manufacturer.

Antibodies and recombinant proteins
All antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) unless otherwise
indicated. These included mouse IgG for ATM (2C1)
(Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), Cdc2 (17), Chk1 (G-4),
Chk2 (B-4) and poly(ADP-ribose) (3H2844); rabbit
IgG for ATM (Ab-3) (EMD Biosciences, San Jose, CA),
Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), Cdc2 (C-19),
Chk1 (FL-476), Chk2 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA),
GAPDH (FL-335), Rac1 (C-14); and goat IgG for Actin
(I-19), ATR (N-19) and phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr15).
Recombinant PAK-1 protein for Rac1 activity
assay was obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, NH)
as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein
containing the full-length human PAK1 protein.
Recombinant p53 protein for ATM and ATR kinase
assays was a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion
protein containing full-length human p53 (Addgene,
Cambridge, MA). Recombinant Cdc25C protein, the
substrate for Chk1 and Chk2 kinase assay, was a GST
fusion protein containing residues 200–256 of human
Cdc25C (kindly provided by Dr. Helen Piwnica-Worms,

Cell cycle analysis
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
was performed on 20,000 cells using a FACS Calibur
instrument (Beckon Dickinson, Mansfield, MA), as
described previously [41].

Analysis for mitotic cells
Cells were exposed to IR in the presence/absence
of Rac1 specific inhibitor NSC23766, harvested at the
indicated times, fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with
propidium iodide (PI) and anti-phospho-histone H3
antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY)
[37]. Mitotic cells, which contain both 4N-DNA content
and phospho-histone H3 [37], were determined using
a FACSCalibur instrument (Beckon Dickinson) and
analyzed by using CELLQUEST software. Each analysis
was performed using 20,000 cells.
