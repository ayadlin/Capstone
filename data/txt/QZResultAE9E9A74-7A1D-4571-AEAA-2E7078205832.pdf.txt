Abstract
Nanomedicines that preferentially deploy cytotoxic agents to tumors and molecular targeted therapeutics that
inhibit speciﬁc aberrant oncogenic drivers are emerging as the new paradigm for the management of cancer.
While combination therapies are a mainstay of cancer chemotherapy, few studies have addressed the combination of nanomedicines and molecular targeted therapeutics. Furthermore, limited knowledge exists on the
impact of sequencing of such therapeutics and nanomedicines on the antitumor outcome. Here, we engineered a
supramolecular cis-platinum nanoparticle, which induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells but also elicited
prosurvival signaling via an EGF receptor/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. A combination of
mathematical modeling and in vitro and in vivo validation using a pharmacologic inhibitor of PI3K, PI828,
demonstrate that administration of PI828 following treatment with the supramolecular cis-platinum nanoparticle results in enhanced antitumor efﬁcacy in breast cancer as compared with when the sequence is reversed or
when the two treatments are administered simultaneously. This study addresses, for the ﬁrst time, the impact of
drug sequencing in the case of a combination of a nanomedicine and a targeted therapeutic. Furthermore, our
results indicate that a rational combination of cis-platinum nanoparticles and a PI3K-targeted therapeutic can
emerge as a potential therapy for breast cancer. Cancer Res; 74(3); 675–85. 2013 AACR.

Cancer chemotherapy relies on rational drug combinations
that inhibit distinct cellular targets. While the earlier generation cytotoxics were combined to target different components of the cell division machinery, the emerging paradigm
is the combination of cytotoxics with molecular targeted
therapeutics. For example, in a recent study, sorafenib with
idarubicin and cytarabine produced a high complete
response rate in FLT3-mutated patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (1). Similarly, geﬁtinib was shown to increase the
efﬁcacy of taxanes in breast cancer by inhibiting the EGFR/Akt
signaling pathway (2). Indeed, many of these combinations are
further rationalized by the feedback upregulation of these
molecular targets following treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy (3). A critical question that therefore arises is whether
the sequence of administration of the agents can potentially
impact the antitumor outcome. For example, the pretreatment
with the anti-angiogenic drugs was hypothesized to transiently
normalize abnormal tumor vasculature and thereby improve
delivery of subsequent chemotherapy (4–6). However, in a
recent provocative clinical study, Van der Veldt and colleagues
demonstrated that pretreatment with bevacizumab reduced
both perfusion and net inﬂux rate of [11C] docetaxel in non–
small cell lung cancer (7), highlighting the critical need to
further understand drug scheduling for optimizing antitumor
outcome.
Another emerging paradigm in cancer chemotherapy is the
use of nanomedicines, which preferentially accumulate in the

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
Here, we develop a minimal mathematical model containing three critical proteins: pAkt, XIAP, and capsase-3. The effects of
cisplatin nanoparticles and PI828 treatments were also included. The basic reaction pathways are shown in Fig. 1A.
Akt phosphorylation is induced by activated PI3K. Once activated, Akt negatively regulates apoptotic pathways at a premitochondrial level by blocking the actions of proteins such as Bad and Bax, which in turn inhibits the release of cytochrome c into
the cytosol. It has also been reported that Akt directly phosphorylates and inactivates cell death protease caspase-9. For simplicity
and to keep the number of parameters manageable, these multiple prosurvival initiatives are considered to have the net effect of
negatively impacting capsase-3 production, see (1) in Fig. 1A.
It has been also reported that active caspase-3 cleaves Akt in vitro and that inhibiting caspase-3 can block this effect. Thus, a
negative feedback is assumed to represent the cleavage of Akt by caspase-3 [Fig. 1A, (2)]. In addition, activated Akt interacts
with and phosphorylates XIAP, protecting it from auto-ubiquitination [Fig. 1A, (3)].
XIAP inhibits caspase-3 by the degradation of caspase-3 [Fig. 1A, (4)], and caspase-3 inhibits XIAP through ubiquitination and
degradation [Fig. 1A, (5)]. Caspase-3 can also inhibit XIAP by inactivating XIAP through formation of a complex.
To include the effect of treatment, we ﬁrst note that based on our experimental data and other studies, cisplatin nanoparticles increases the production of pAkt. This activation might be mediated through EGFR and PI3K. Similar to previous studies,
our data shows an increase in caspase-3 due to cisplatin nanoparticles. This increase could be due to activation of FasL, which in
turn activates caspase-8 and subsequently caspase-3. Another possible pathway is the release of cytochrome c, which subsequently activates caspase-9 and caspase-3.
In addition, phosphorylation of XIAP by Akt protects ubiquitination and degradation of XIAP in response to cisplatin. As we have
only considered the active form of XIAP in our model, we assume that cisplatin nanoparticles reduce XIAP, as observed in the
experimental data. The reduction in XIAP could be also due to an increase in caspase-3. Finally, we assume that PI828 inhibits
phosphorylation of Akt by binding to PI3K.
Using all of the aforementioned considerations, a system of equations corresponding to the network shown in Fig. 1A can be


formulated that includes the production, decay, inhibition, and treatment effects of these proteins. Letting P ¼ pAkt =P0 ,


C ¼ Casp3 =C0 , X ¼ ½XIAP=X0 denote the nondimensional concentrations of the three proteins of interest, the system of
equations corresponding to the network shown in Fig. 1A is given by:

dt

where the concentration of PI828 is denoted by gi ðtÞ and the effects of cisplatin nanoparticle on pAkt and cleaved caspase-3
production are denoted by fp ðtÞ and fc ðtÞ, respectively. The release of cisplatin from nanoparticles is given by a biexponential
release proﬁle that captures the rapid burst upon administration followed by a sustained release. We assume that the effect of
cisplatin nanoparticle on pAkt and cleaved caspase-3 production satisfy the relations:
dfj
¼ rc ci ðt  Ti Þ  dj fj ;
dt

j ¼ c; p;

where ci is the intracellular concentration of cisplatin and Ti is an intracellular time delay. The Supplementary Information
contains additional details of the models used for nanoparticle release and transport and subsequent effects on protein expression.
The parameters in the mathematical model were estimated from in vitro measurements of the relative expression of
caspase-3, pAkt, and XIAP by using the Matlab toolbox PottersWheel (www.potterswheel.de). The details of the parameter
estimation for protein expression and treatment effects can be found in the Supplementary Information.
We can then consider the effects of cisplatin nanoparticle and/or PI828 therapies on tumor cells at the population level, Fig. 1B.
For tumor cells, we assumed that birth rate is proportional to pAkt expression, whereas death rate is proportional to cleaved
caspase-3 expression:

¼ ½lN P  dN C N :

From this relation, we propose that the resultant cell viability of combinations of cisplatin nanoparticle and PI828 treatments
can be predicted solely on the basis of the concentrations of these two proteins; see Supplementary Information for parameters.

ethylenediamine–succinic acid conjugate was reacted with
aquated Pt[(NH3)2(OH2)2]2þ in 1:1 ratio at pH ¼ 6.5 to obtain
a cholesterol–succinate–cis-platinum complex. The intermediates and the ﬁnal product were characterized by 1H,
13
C, and 195Pt NMR spectroscopy. We engineered SACNs from
the cholesterol succinate–cisplatin complex by a solvent evaporation, hydration, and extrusion method using phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol succinate–cisplatinum complex and
DSPE-PEG2000-NH2 in 2:1:0.2 weight ratio. The SACNs were
characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and cryoTEM to visualize their size distribution and ultrastructure. For
release kinetics, drug-loaded nanoparticles were suspended in
buffer (pH ¼ 5.5 or 7) and sealed in a dialysis membrane
(molecular weight cutoff ¼ 500 Da). The dialysis bags were
incubated in 1 L PBS buffer. An aliquot was collected from the
dialysis bag at predetermined time intervals, and the released
drug was quantiﬁed from the decrease in Pt content in the
dialysis chamber over time.

a combination of liposomal doxorubicin and bortezomib
is approved for use in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (11). However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have
been conducted to elucidate the impact of sequencing the
administration of a cytotoxic nanoparticle and a molecular
targeted therapeutic on the antitumor outcome.
In this current study, we explored the impact of sequencing of
a cisplatin-based supramolecular nanoparticle with an inhibitor
of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Cisplatin is widely used,
including in testicular, ovarian, cervical, and lung cancer (12, 13),
and is reported to be effective in triple-negative breast cancer
(14). The use of cisplatin is however dose-limited due to nephrotoxicity (15). As a result, in a recent study, we engineered a
polymeric cisplatinum (II) nanoparticle, which preferentially
accumulated in the tumor and bypassed the kidney, and exhibited an enhanced antitumor efﬁcacy compared to cisplatin (16).
However, recent studies have indicated that cisplatin can upregulate PI3K signaling, which can attenuate apoptosis via survivin (17). This suggests that a rational combination of a PI3K
inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy can result in
increased antitumor outcome. Indeed, here we demonstrate
that treatment with a novel self-assembling cis-platinum nanoparticle (SACN) results in a similar activation of PI3K/Akt
signaling, providing the interesting opportunity to explore the
earlier raised question on the impact of drug and nanoparticle
sequencing on outcome. We used mathematical modeling to
predict the optimal temporal scheduling of SACNs and a PI3K
inhibitor, which were then validated in vitro and in vivo. Several
quantitative approaches of varying complexity have been developed to study intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis (18–21). Here, we
considered a minimal mathematical model containing 3 critical
proteins: pAkt, XIAP, and caspase-3 (22–30). Our results reveal
the treatment with SACNs followed by the administration of
PI828 results in greater antitumor outcome. These results
indicate that the appropriate sequencing of cytotoxic nanomedicines and targeted therapeutics has to be established for
optimal chemotherapeutic efﬁciency.

In vitro cell viability studies
4T1 breast cancer cells (obtained from American Type
Culture Collection and used within 6 months of resuscitation
of frozen stock) were seeded in 96-well plates and grown for 24
hours. Cells were treated with drugs for deﬁned time periods
and in speciﬁc sequences. Culture media was replaced and
cells were washed with plain media between the 2 treatments
so that at any given time only one drug was present in the
culture media. At 48 hours of total incubation time, cell
viability was measured using a CellTiter 96 Aqueous One
Solution assay (Promega).
Immunoblotting
4T1 breast cancer cells (1  105/well) were grown in 6-well
plates for 24 hours. Cells were then treated as described earlier.
The cells were lysed postincubation with 3 radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer containing 1 HALT phosphatase/
protease inhibitor (ThermoFisher). Proteins were electrophoretically resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto polyvinyldene diﬂuoride membranes, blocked for 1 hour with 7%
nonfat dry milk, and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 C
with primary antibody directed against the desired protein.
Proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-

GeneTools.
In vivo tumor growth study
4T1 breast cancer cells (3  105) were implanted subcutaneously in the ﬂanks of 4-week-old BALB/c female mice (weighing 20 g, Charles River Laboratories). The drug therapy was
started when the tumors reached approximately 100 cc in
volume. SACNs were administered via tail vein injection, whereas PI828 was administered intraperitoneally. Treatments were
administered on alternate days and a total of 3 doses were given
for each drug. In animals groups receiving sequential treatment
with 2 different drugs (SACNs and PI828), the administration of
second drug was started only after completion of 3 doses of the
ﬁrst drug. The tumor volumes were calculated using formula
L  B2. Tumor volume was then used to calculate the percentage increase in tumor volume using the formula Vt/V0  100.
Plotting the percentage increase in tumor volume versus time
gives the rate of tumor growth. The animals were sacriﬁced
when the average tumor size of the control exceeded 1,500 mm3
in the control group. All animal procedures were approved by
the Harvard Institutional Use and Care of Animals Committee.

aquation more efﬁciently than when the Pt is chelated using
dicarboxylato bonds or via a monocarboxylato and an N!Pt
coordinate bond (16). In this study, we harnessed this Pt
coordination environment via the design of a cholesterol–
succinate leaving group (Fig. 2A). This enabled the supramolecular assembly of a nanoparticle arising from hydrophobic
hydrophilic arrangements of cholesterol–succinic acid–platinum (II) molecule, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG) (Fig. 2A). The ultrastructure
analysis using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM) (Fig. 2B) revealed the formation of predominantly unilamellar structures less than 200 nm in diameter, although
29.9%  5.47% of the nanoparticles formed were bilamellar.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) further conﬁrmed the size
distribution of SACNs (Fig. 2C). Loading efﬁciency was calculated to be 48%  15%. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2D,
SACNs exhibited a pH-dependent release of platinum (II).
Interestingly, during the study period, we observed a plateauing of the amount of drug released, suggesting that the
nanoparticles enable sustained release, which could potentially arise from the insertion of the hydrophobic cholesterol
component in the lipid bilayer whereas the Pt–succinate
coordination end could be oriented on both the external and
the internal surfaces of the lipid bilayer. We observed a
maximal 60% (and not 100%) of platinum (II) release from
the SACNs at pH 5.5 over the study period, which could arise
due to an dissociation equilibrium that exists between Pt and
the leaving group, which is further supported by the fact that
we only observe 35% of the aquated platinum being released at

5 mmol/L (H) cisplatin-equivalent concentrations, and a concurrent decrease in XIAP expression (I and J), respectively ( , P < 0.05; #, P < 0.01; ANOVA followed
by Newman–Keul post hoc test). K, 4T1 cells were incubated with 1 mmol/L SACN in the presence or absence of 1 mmol/L erlotinib, which diminishes Akt signal.
L, following incubation with 5 mmol/L SACN for 48 hours, adherent cells were trypsinized and replated for acute population outgrowth (24 hours) to isolate an
adherent, surviving population of cells (SACN-S). 4T1 parent cells or SACN-S were analyzed for phosphorylated Akt expression by Western blotting.

pH7 (acidic pH can drive the equilibrium toward dissociation
or greater release of Pt (II) from the SACNs). A similar release
kinetics pattern has been reported earlier (16).
Cisplatin nanoparticle causes activation of PI3K
pathway by downstream EGFR signaling
As expected with platinum-based chemotherapeutics, 4T1
cells treated with SACNs exhibited a dose-dependent increase
in the levels of cleaved caspase-3, indicating the onset of
apoptosis with time. Interestingly, treatments with SACNs also
resulted in a time-dependent increase in the expression of pAKT on Western blot analysis, indicating an activation of the
PI3K signaling pathway (Fig. 3A, B, E–H). We also observed a
time-dependent decrease in expression of XIAP with SACN
treatment (Fig. 3C, I, and J). Furthermore, SACN treatment also
induced a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of

EGFR at Tyr1086 (Fig. 3D), but not at Tyr1173. To conﬁrm the
involvement of EGFR, co-incubation of the EGFR-speciﬁc
inhibitor, erlotinib (1 mmol/L), with SACN (1 mmol/L) led to
ablation of the enhanced p-AKT signaling (Fig. 3K). To conﬁrm
the importance of Akt phosphorylation as a survival advantage,
we next isolated a subset of 4T1 cells that escaped SACNinduced cell death. Speciﬁcally, the generation of SACN survivors (SACN-S) was achieved by incubation of 4T1 breast cancer
cells with 5 mmol/L SACN for 48 hours. Subsequently, adherent
cells were trypsinized, replated, and cultured for an additional
24 hours. The adherent cells were lysed and analyzed by
Western blotting, which conﬁrmed that SACN-S retain a
signiﬁcantly enhanced phosphorylated Akt signature, consistent with activation of this pathway (Fig. 3L). In addition, as
shown in Fig. 4A and B treatment with PI828 inhibited baseline
PI3K signaling in the 4T1 cells in a time-dependent manner,

inhibition of pAkt after PI828 administration was also facilitated by the model (Fig. 4F). On the basis of our assumptions
and the above data, the model predicted the desired synergistic
effects of the combination treatments. Relative to the control
case, the mathematical model predicted synergistic increase in
caspase-3 due to treatment with SACNs along with the p-Akt
inhibition provided by PI828 (Fig. 4G and H respectively). In
addition, as shown in Fig. 5A, PI828 administered after SACN

treatment was predicted to result in lower cell viability compared with pretreatment with PI828 followed by SACNs treatment or with SACNs alone. We then sought to ﬁnd the most
efﬁcient time for the administration of PI828 after cisplatin
nanoparticle treatment. It was determined that administration
of PI828 approximately 24 hours after cisplatin would yield
lower cell viability as compared to 36 hours or earlier times
(Fig. 5B).
Validation of predicted model in vitro and in vivo
To evaluate the efﬁcacy of combination therapy regimen, we
conducted cell viability assay using 4T1 cell line. Cell viability
was quantiﬁed by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner
salt, assay. As shown in Fig. 5C, a signiﬁcant shift in the cell
viability curve to the left with combination regimen of SACNs
followed by PI828 posttreatment compared to SACN alone
(IC50 ¼ 7.87 mmol/L) and combination regimen of pretreatment with PI828 followed by SACNs (IC50 ¼ 14.93 mmol/L).
Indeed, in the 4T1 cells preincubated with SACNs for 24 hours,
PI828 resulted in marked suppression of the PI3K activity as
early as 6 hours posttreatment (Fig. 5D, E and G) and was
maintained until 30 hours. In addition, posttreatment with
PI828 also signiﬁcantly increased the levels of cleaved caspase3 levels in a temporal manner when combined with SACNs,
indicating synergistic pro-apoptotic effects (Fig. 5D and F).
Interestingly, while posttreatment with PI828 abolished SACNinduced phosphorylation of Akt to baseline, pretreatment with
PI828 only had a minimal effect (Fig. 5G).
Antitumor efﬁcacy of the proposed temporal combination
regimens was evaluated in vivo using 4T1 syngeneic tumor
model. BALB/c mice bearing subcutaneous 4T1 breast tumors
were treated with the following drug combinations: (i) vehicle
only, (ii) PI828 (10.0 mg/kg  3 doses), SACNs (0.5 mg/kg  3
doses), (iii) pretreatment with PI828 (10 mg/kg  3 doses)
followed by SACNs (0.5 mg/kg  3 doses), and (iv) SACNs (0.5
mg/kg  3 doses) followed by PI828 (10 mg/kg  3 doses). We
selected a suboptimal dose of SACNs and a therapeutically
active dose of PI828 such that we can dissect any synergistic
effect that would otherwise get masked by higher doses of
SACNs. While our predictive modeling based on in vitro data
suggested that the maximal efﬁcacy will be attained where the
PI3K inhibitor is administered 24 hours posttreatment with
SACNs, in the in vivo studies such a temporal sequence was not
followed as PI828 administered after the ﬁrst dose of SACN
would have served a pretreatment for the next dose of SACN,
thereby confounding the results. As the goal of the study was to
test whether sequencing of administration of a molecularly
targeted therapeutic and a cytotoxic nanoparticle has any
effect on the antitumor outcome, we used a modiﬁed regimen.
We rationalized that the repeated dosing will enable enhanced
drug concentration in the tumor as a result of sustained drug
release as observed in our previous study (16), leading to the
activation of Akt and enabling us to test the hypothesis. Indeed,
as seen in Fig. 5H, animals that received PI828 posttreatment
with SACNs exhibited greater inhibition in the rate of tumor
growth than pretreatment with PI828 in combination with
SACNs, consistent with the in vitro studies and mathematical

682

predictions. To elucidate the mechanism behind the synergistic effect on tumor growth reduction, Western blot analysis
was conducted on tumor samples that showed a signiﬁcantly
increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 in tumors treated
with PI828 post-treatment with SACNs (Fig. 5I).
In a separate experiment, we next compared a traditional
combination of the SACNs and PI828 administered simultaneously to a sequenced dosing where PI828 was administered
following treatment with SACNs (adapted from the previous
experimental design that demonstrated that this sequence
was superior compared to pretreatment with PI828). As shown
in Fig. 5J, the sequenced dosing was observed to be superior to
treatments administered simultaneously.

Discussion
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a
considerably more aggressive course than other subtypes (31).
Currently, about 15% of all patients with breast cancer are
diagnosed as TNBCs, and cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens
remain the standard of care for these patients (32). Preclinical
studies have revealed that basal-like TNBC, which constitutes
approximately 75% of all TNBCs, is sensitive to cisplatin, and
indeed cisplatin is an emerging treatment modality for this
indication (33). Cisplatin is a widely used cytotoxic agent with
very high efﬁcacy but is limited by its dose-limiting nephrotoxicity (15). In a recent study, we overcame this limitation by
engineering a supramolecular nanoparticle (SACN), which
preferentially accumulated in tumors and bypassed the kidney
(34). Indeed, consistent with the clinical data demonstrating
efﬁcacy of platinates in TNBC, our results indicate that the
SACNs does exert a potent apoptotic effect on the 4T1 breast
cancer cells as evident by increased temporal expression of
cleaved caspases. Interestingly, treatment with the SACNs
simultaneously induced a statistically signiﬁcant temporal
upregulation of p-Akt, indicating a prosurvival signaling program initiated by the cell in response to chemotherapy. This is
consistent with previous observations where PI3K/Akt signaling was reported to contribute to platinum drug resistance
(35, 36). Our results indicate that a cisplatin-based nanoparticle will face a similar limitation in the clinics, and may need to
be combined with PI3K inhibitors. Indeed, combinations of
drugs that inhibit the PI3K signaling axis and platinum-based
chemotherapy are currently in early-phase clinical trials for
TNBCs (37).
Upregulation of the PI3K pathway, either upstream or
through mutation-based activation, is one of the most frequently altered pathways in breast cancer (38). The class I PI3K
family (p110a, p110b, p110d, p110g) are activated by tyrosine
kinases or G-protein–coupled receptors to generate PIP3,
which activates downstream effectors such as Akt (39). While
our results showed a temporal expression of phosphorylated
Akt following treatment with SACN thereby conﬁrming the
activation of PI3K signaling, we also observed a similar temporal increase in the phosphorylation of EGFR at Y1086. The
increased autophosphorylation was site-speciﬁc as there was
no signiﬁcant increase at Y1173, another EGFR phosphorylation site involved in downstream ERK signaling (40). The Y1086

residue is known to be involved in downstream PI3K signaling
(41), thus strengthening the case for EGFR downstream signaling to be responsible for the observed p-Akt levels following
SACN treatment. This observation correlates with prior studies, where cisplatin resulted in EGFR activation (27, 42). In a
separate study, we have observed that cytotoxic chemotherapeutics can enable the selection of a subset cells that exhibit
enhanced PI3K signaling (43). The current results are consistent with our previous observation, suggesting that the cytotoxic nanoparticles will also be limited by adaptive resistance,
and therefore will need to be combined with molecularly
targeted therapeutics. Indeed, combination of cisplatin along
with EGFR or PI3K inhibitors has shown promise in prior
studies (44, 45). However, a number of phase III trials evaluating the combination of cisplatin with geﬁtinib have failed,
and indications for their failure include poor drug scheduling
(46, 47). We rationalized that developing an optimal algorithm
for temporally sequencing a PI3K inhibitor and SACNs could
potentially lead to superior outcomes.
In a recent study, Lee and colleagues demonstrated pretreatment, but not posttreatment or co-treatment, of a subset
of TNBC with EGFR inhibitors can enhance their apoptotic
response to DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents (48). However,
given the redundancies in signaling downstream of tyrosine
kinases such as EGFR, we focused on the inhibition of PI3K
using a highly potent PI3K inhibitor, PI828 (49), which was
found to suppress both basal and SACN-induced activation of
PI3K/Akt signaling, resulting in increased cleaved caspase
expression, highlighting the balance between survival signaling
and apoptosis. However, both our mathematical model and in
vitro and in vivo data indicated that unlike the results in the Lee
and colleagues study, posttreatment, and not pretreatment,
with PI828 synergized with SACNs. A likely explanation is the
temporally sustained release of aquated platinate (II) from the
SACNs, which was found to be pH-dependent, and was factored into the model. Alternatively, the relative hierarchy in the
signaling pathway, that is, PI3K being downstream of EGFR,
could potentially translate into distinct temporal requirements
for optimal inhibition of the signaling cascade with pharmacologic inhibitors when combined with SACNs.
The subcutaneous 4T1 in vivo model used in this study is an
extremely aggressive and spontaneously metastasizing syngeneic model and is representative of late-stage metastatic
TNBCs (50). The enhanced efﬁcacy displayed in this model
with PI828 posttreatment following a SACN therapy is therefore encouraging and could potentially be clinically signiﬁcant
as combinations of nanomedicines and molecular targeted
therapeutics are increasingly used. However, while it well
established that drug ratio is critical to determine whether
a drug combination is additive or synergistic, in the case of a
combination of a nanoparticle with a targeted therapeutic it

becomes more complicated as in all likelihood the nanoparticle slowly releases the cytotoxic before and after PI828 is
administered. As a result, the tumor cell is actually exposed to
varying ratios of these two drugs over the course of treatment.
In vivo, one could assume that the repeated cycles of the
cytotoxic nanoparticle, combined with the EPR effect (resulting in preferential accumulation in the tumor) and the sustained release of the active drug, could translate into steadystate concentration of the cytotoxic in the tumor. Future
studies are required to dissect this out. Furthermore, the
strategy of combining signaling inhibitors with cytotoxic
nanoparticles to achieve temporally synergistic combinations
while reducing peripheral side effects can be reﬁned even
further by potentially combining both agents in a single
nanoparticle. Indeed, in a previous study, we have demonstrated that a nanoparticle model system enabling combination
therapy with temporal release can exert a superior antitumor
outcome (9). The current study opens up the possibility of
engineering next-generation nanoparticles, harnessing mathematical modeling in nanoparticle design such that multiple
payloads are released at a differential but deﬁned rate, thereby
producing optimal synergy between the active agents.
