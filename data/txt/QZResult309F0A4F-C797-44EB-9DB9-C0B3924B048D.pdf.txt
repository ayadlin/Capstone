BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding racial disparities in characteristics and outcomes among patients with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL). METHODS: The characteristics and outcomes of untreated African American (AA) patients with CLL (n ¼ 84) were
analyzed and compared with a reference nonblack (NB) patient population (n ¼ 1571). RESULTS: At the time of presentation, AA
patients had lower median hemoglobin levels (12.9 g/dL vs 13.7 g/dL), higher b2 microglobulin levels (2.7 mg/dL vs 2.4 mg/dL),
greater frequency of constitutional symptoms (27% vs 10%), unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) mutation
status (65% vs 47%), f-chain–associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) expression (58% vs 32%), and deletion of chromosome 17p or
chromosome 11q (28% vs 17%; P  02 for each comparison). Fifty-one percent of AA patients and 39% of NB patients required firstline therapy and 91% and 88%, respectively, received chemoimmunotherapy. Overall response rates to treatment were 85% for AA
patients and 94% for NB patients (P ¼.06); and the complete response rates were 56% and 58%, respectively (P ¼.87). The median
survival of AA patients was shorter compared with that of NB patients (event-free survival: 36 months vs 61 months; P ¼.007; overall
survival: 152 months vs not reached; P ¼.0001). AA race was an independent predictor of shorter event-free and overall survival in
multivariable regression models. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that AA patients with CLL have more unfavorable

INTRODUCTION
Extensive literature has demonstrated that patients with cancer who belong to minority racial groups fare less well than
Caucasians.1 Studies on racial disparities among both adults and children with a variety of solid tumors have uniformly
confirmed a worse prognosis for African American (AA) patients compared with nonblack (NB) patients.1,2 In particular,
the long-term survival of AA patients diagnosed with cancer is significantly inferior to that of Caucasian patients for virtually all types of cancer.2 The same observations have been made with respect to hematologic malignancies.1-9 Numerous
reasons have been put forth to explain this phenomenon. These putative variables include: AA patients’ comparatively inferior socioeconomic status (SES) and access to high-quality care; greater reluctance to seek medical attention; lower adherence to screening procedures, compliance with therapy or follow-up visits, and acceptance of supportive measures or
certain therapeutic options (such as stem cell transplantation); higher burden of comorbidities at the time of cancer diagnosis; lower enrollment rate in clinical trials; more aggressive disease phenotype; and a more adverse pharmacogenetic profile.10-12
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) has an overall disease-specific incidence
per 100,000 population per year of 5.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.43-5.56; CLL: 4.17; 95% CI, 4.12-4.23; SLL:
1.32; 95% CI, 1.29-1.35) and is more frequent among males than females, with an incidence rate ratio of 1.89 (95% CI,
1.85-1.93).13 There is considerable racial variability in the distribution and clinical course of CLL/SLL. Analyses of

information from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) database have indicated that the incidence of CLL is lower among AAs than Caucasians, with a
calculated incidence rate ratio of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.690.77).13,14 In addition to a lower incidence of CLL/SLL,
AA patients with CLL/SLL have an inferior 5-year relative
survival rate compared with whites (77.1% vs 63.9%;
P ¼ .01). This discrepancy persists regardless of the year
of diagnosis.14 It has also been observed that, compared
with Caucasians, AAs with CLL/SLL present at a significantly younger age. Among patients with SLL, AAs have
more advanced stage at diagnosis, more frequent constitutional symptoms, and a greater extent of extranodal disease.14 Factors accounting for these differences can only
be hypothesized at this time, because population-based or
registry-based studies are descriptive by nature, are potentially limited by ascertainment bias, and contain a low
level of detail.
To address this gap in knowledge regarding racial
disparity, we analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of
AA patients with CLL/SLL who were referred to our institutions. We compared this patient cohort with a reference
NB CLL/SLL patient population that was evaluated over
the same time period. The results of our detailed analysis
of demographic, clinical, and biologic parameters as well
as assessments of response to treatment with chemoimmunotherapy and long-term outcomes are presented.

heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) gene mutational status. The presence of the following molecular cytogenetic
abnormalities was determined from fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) results using bone marrow (BM) or
peripheral blood (PB) samples: chromosome 17p deletion
(del17p), chromosome 11q deletion (del11q), trisomy of
chromosome 12, and chromosome 13q deletion (del13q).
The clinical data also included CD38 expression (as determined by flow cytometry with BM or PB samples) and fchain–associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) expression
(as assessed by immunohistochemical analysis on BM
samples or by flow cytometry on PB samples).3 Treatment
information included the start date of treatment (if applicable), the treatment regimen used, and treatment duration. Indications for treatment initiation included a
lymphocyte doubling time <6 months, enlarging lymphadenopathies, symptomatic splenomegaly, evidence of
BM failure, constitutional or mass-related symptoms, and
symptomatic leukostasis.4 Information on outcome
included, as applicable, the type of response to therapy,
date of treatment failure, date of last follow-up, survival
status, and cause of death.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

Study Design

We reviewed paper and electronic records of patients with
newly diagnosed CLL/SLL who had been consecutively
referred to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center (MDACC) or Duke University Medical Center
(DUMC) between 1997 and 2011. We identified 160 AA
patients with CLL (118 who were followed at MDACC
and 42 who were followed at DUMC). Eighty-four
patients were untreated at the time of referral and formed
our AA study population. Similarly, we identified a total
of 1571 consecutive untreated NB patients with CLL,
who served as the comparison group. This sample constitutes all CLL patients who attended our institutions during the study period. Data were collected in a
retrospective manner. CLL and SLL were analyzed aggregately in this study and are referred to here as CLL.
Information was organized into 4 categories. 1) Demographic characteristics included patient age at the time
of CLL diagnosis, sex, and race (the latter defined per
patient self-reported ancestry). 2) Clinical data included
date of diagnosis of CLL, date of referral to MDACC or

The first objective of the current study was to analyze the
characteristics of untreated AA patients with CLL compared with those of a reference population of untreated
NB patients with CLL. The second objective was to analyze time to treatment (TTT), response to therapy, and
survival outcomes in terms of event-free survival (EFS)
and overall survival (OS) in the 2 patient populations.
Treatment indications and response to therapy were
assessed according to the 1996 version of the National
Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group criteria.16
TTT was defined as the interval between the date of presentation at MDACC or DUMC and the date first-line
treatment started. Patients who never received treatment
were censored at their last follow-up date. The overall
response rate (ORR) included a partial response (PR) or
better. EFS was defined as the time between the date of
treatment and the date of death, disease progression, or
last follow-up, whichever occurred first. Patients who
were alive and without disease progression at the last follow-up date were censored at that time. OS was defined as

death or last follow-up, whichever occurred first. Patients
who were alive at the last follow-up date were censored at
that time.
Because the AA patient population was much
smaller than the NB population, the spectrum of treatments that had been used for the former was narrower. To
create a matched comparison between the 2 groups in our
analyses of response and EFS, we created a subgroup of
NB patients who had received the same therapies as the
AA group. This study was approved by the institutional
review boards of MDACC and DUMC and was conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and the
Declaration of Helsinki.

multivariable logistic regression models were fit to assess
the association between prognostic factors and response.

lymph nodes (10% vs 1%; P < .0001) and constitutional
symptoms (27% vs 10%; P < .0001). The distribution of
Rai stage also differed significantly between groups, with
the NB group having a higher proportion of patients with
stage 0 disease (32% vs 21%; P ¼ .02). The prognostic
profile of AA patients at the time of referral also differed
from that of NB patients (Table 1). In particular, AA
patients had a significantly higher proportion of cases with
unmutated IGHV gene status (65% vs 47%; P ¼ .006) and
had a different distribution of cytogenetic features
(P ¼ .0004), with a higher fraction of del11q among AAs
(20% vs 11%). ZAP70 expression also was more frequent
in AA patients than in NB patients (58% vs 32%;
P ¼ .004), but there was no statistically significant difference in CD38 expression (35% vs 30%; P ¼ .38). To evaluate ascertainment bias as a potential contributing factor for
the discrepancies in the presenting characteristics between
AA and NB patients, we assessed the time from diagnosis to
referral to MDACC or DUMC. The median time to first
visit was shorter for AAs compared with NBs (2.3 months
[range, 0-86 months] vs 4.1 months [range, 0-428 months],
respectively; P ¼ .001).

Forty-three of the 84 AA patients (51%) required therapy,
compared with only 607 of 1571 NB patients (39%). The
median TTT was 14.3 months and 57.2 months for those
43 AA patients and 607 NB patients, respectively
(P ¼ .007; log-rank test) (Fig. 1A).
Four hundred eighty-seven NB patients received the
same treatment regimens that were received by the AA
patient group. The ORR to first-line therapy was 85% in
AA patients and 94% in NB patients, and the complete
response rate was 56% and 58%, respectively. There was
no statistically significant difference in the ORR or the
complete response rate between the 2 groups (P ¼ .06 and
P ¼ .87, respectively). Because the majority of patients in
both groups received chemoimmunotherapy as first-line
treatment, we next focused on response to this type of
therapy. Ninety-one percent of the 43 AA patients and
88% of the 487 NB patients received chemoimmunotherapy (P ¼ .81). Chemoimmunotherapy consisted of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR);
rituximab-intensified FCR (FCR3); FCR plus granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF);
FCR plus mithoxantrone; FCR plus alemtuzumab; or
pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Within
this subgroup of patients, the ORR was 92% for AAs and
96% for NBs (P ¼ .21), and the complete response rate
values were 62% and 64%, respectively (P ¼ .86).

(P ¼ .0002) but not with Rai stages 3 and 4 (P ¼ .18)
(Fig. 2D). The most significant factors associated with
EFS duration in the univariate analysis were age, race,
WBC count, b2-m level, cytogenetic abnormalities,
IGHV status, ZAP70 expression, and type of first-line
treatment. Of these variables, higher b2-m level, higher
WBC count, presence of del17p, unmutated IGHV status, and AA race were each independently correlated with
shorter EFS in the multivariate model (Table 3). Similarly, age, race, constitutional symptoms, Rai stage, Hgb
level, b2-m level, del17p, IGHV status, CD38 expression,
and ZAP70 expression were associated with OS in the
univariate analysis. In the multivariable model, only older
age, advanced Rai stage, presence of del17p, unmutated
IGHV status, and AA race each retained an independent
adverse effect on OS (Table 4). These observations indicate that AA race is associated with the presence of worse
prognostic factors and, per se, is a predictor of shorter EFS
and OS in patients with CLL.

Sixty-six AA patients and 1428 NB patients are alive.
Causes of death among the AA patients included CLL and
CLL-related complications (progressive disease in 4
patients, other cancers in 3, and septic shock in 1), treatment-related complications (stem cell transplantationrelated death in 1 patient, subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1,
and pulmonary thromboembolism in 1), and other causes
(advanced dementia in 1 patient and accident in 1); and
the cause of death was unknown for 5 patients. Among
the NB patients, the causes of death included CLL and
CLL-related complications (progressive disease in 12
patients, infectious complications in 20, Richter transformation in 14, other cancers in 29, and aplastic anemia in
1), treatment-related complications (hemorrhage in 2
patients, pulmonary embolism in 2, drug-related hepatotoxicity in 1, and stem cell transplantation-related in 6),
and other causes (cardiovascular in 5 patients, cerebrovascular in 3, dementia in 1, accident in 1, and suicide in 1);
and cause of death was unknown for 45 patients. The median OS was 152 months for the AA group and was not
reached for the NB group (P ¼ .0001; log-rank test) (Fig.
1B). The median EFS was 36 months (95% CI, 21-47
months) for the AA group and 61 months (95% CI, 4975 months) for the NB group (P ¼ .0007) (Fig. 1C).
The survival of AA patients was statistically significantly inferior to that of NB patients across different levels
of b2-m (2 mg/dL or >2 mg/dL), IGHV gene mutation
status (mutated or unmutated), and cytogenetic abnormalities (del17p plus del11q or other abnormalities; P 

DISCUSSION
We conducted a comprehensive retrospective analysis to
study the presenting features and clinical outcomes of AA
patients diagnosed with CLL who were referred to 2 tertiary care centers. To our knowledge, this is the first study
of AA patients with CLL to provide such a high degree of
detail. We observed significant differences in baseline
characteristics between AA patients and NB patients. Specifically, adverse prognostic factors for CLL occurred
more frequently among AAs and included: low Hgb level,
advanced Rai stage, constitutional symptoms, high b2-m
level, unmutated IGHV, cytogenetic abnormalities, and
ZAP70 positivity. These discrepancies may explain the
shorter time to first treatment and worse survival in AA
patients with CLL.
There are 2 possible limitations of the current
study. First, the characteristics of the population
referred to our centers may not be entirely representative of the overall CLL population. In particular, the
median age of both AA and NB patients at the time of
referral was 59 years. This age is in line with previous
separate reports from both of our groups but is lower
compared with 72 years, which is the median age at the
time of CLL diagnosis reported in the SEER registry. In
addition, we likely observed a higher proportion of
patients with more aggressive CLL features and, consequently, indication for treatment, because this is frequently the reason for patient referral. Finally, the

patients who progressed after initial treatment received
subsequent therapy at our institutions, survival still may
be influenced by treatment choices after disease progression and by the management of late complications or
the timeliness of detecting relapses.
There is extensive literature indicating that the prognosis
for AA cancer patients, particularly for long-term survival, is
worse than that for whites across various hematologic malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia,8,20-22 acute lymphoblastic leukemia,6,8,23,24 Hodgkin4,25 and non-Hodgkin
lymphoma,3,5,7,26 and CLL.9,14 However, data in those
reports are insufficiently detailed, and only ‘‘educated hypotheses’’ have been made to address this phenomenon. Shenoy
and colleagues have recently published an analysis of data
from 13 SEER registries between 1992 and 2007. Those
authors reported inferior 2-year and 5-year relative survival for
AA patients with CLL compared with Caucasians as well as
the independent prognostic relevance of race in patient outcome. However, because of the population-based nature and
the time period covered by their analysis, information
regarding relevant prognostic factors was very limited.
No information on the type of treatment was reported.
Although the authors did demonstrate slight improvement in
outcome for patients who received treatment after the year
2000, suggesting that newer treatment modalities may be of
benefit overall, they were not able to ascertain whether this
improvement differed according to race.14
3184

SES is frequently discussed as a potential prognostic
factor in cancer medicine, because it can affect several important components of cancer patient management.27
Delay or failure to seek medical attention is a problem that
appears to correlate with SES.11 It has been suggested that
cancer patients belonging to minority racial or ethnic
groups, including AAs, may have poorer access to health
care facilities for medical concerns or routine blood tests,
leading to potential diagnostic delay and more advanced disease at diagnosis.11 However, we did not observe significant
differences in terms of the type or extent of insurance coverage at the time of referral between AA patients and NB
patients (94% and 99%), and the distribution of occupations was similar (data not shown). Moreover, the time
from diagnosis (made either incidentally or because of clinical symptoms) to referral was shorter for AA patients than
for NB patients in our analysis, making this difference an
unlikely cause of the worse prognosis for the AA patients
included in the current analysis. Finally, it has been demonstrated that timeliness of diagnosis does not affect patient
outcome in CLL28 to the extent it does in acute leukemia.29
Arguably, reluctance to present to medical attention may
explain why the AA group was enriched in cases with more
aggressive, symptomatic disease. However, the inferior survival of AA patients persisted when stratifying the patients
according to relevant prognostic factors. More important,
multivariable analyses indicated race as an independent
prognostic factor for both shorter EFS and shorter OS, even
when controlling for other relevant clinical and prognostic
variables. Lesser compliance with therapy and therapyrelated procedures among AA patients also has been
hypothesized. According to our review, this is unlikely to be
the case in our patient group, because no differences in
terms of number of cycles or treatment duration were noted
between AA patients and NB patients.
Bach and colleagues30 suggested that disparities in
outcome between AA and NB patients with cancer might
disappear if the same treatment is received by both groups.
For the analysis of response to treatment and outcome, we
focused on patients receiving first-line chemoimmunotherapy, because this is the treatment received by the vast
majority of our AA and NB patients, and it represents the
standard of care for newly diagnosed CLL. We analyzed
response to treatment and patient outcome aggregately
for all chemoimmunotherapy-based combinations,
because the results achieved with most of these regimens
in our hands have been similar and significantly better compared with conventional chemotherapy without the addition of monoclonal antibodies. It is noteworthy that
response rates to chemoimmunotherapy were similar

between AAs and NBs. Race had no notable influence on
the likelihood of response in the univariate and multivariable models, suggesting that potential race-specific differences in chemosensitivity are not relevant to response to
chemoimmunotherapy. However, compared with the
NB group, the median duration of response to chemoimmunotherapy was shorter in the AA group, resulting in inferior EFS and ultimately worse OS. Although AA patients
had a higher proportion of cases with known adverse prognostic factors, the negative impact of AA race on both EFS
and OS persisted as an independent variable. These findings
suggest that, although they induce similarly high response
rates, such treatments do not overcome racial differences in
outcome among patients with CLL. Eighteen deaths have
occurred to date among our AA patients without excess in
any specific cause of death in this group.
In conclusion, our analysis demonstrated that AA
patients with CLL present with more unfavorable clinical and biologic characteristics, have an earlier need of
treatment, have shorter remission duration after FCRbased chemoimmunotherapy regimens, and have a
shorter OS compared with NB patients. This race-associated discrepancy is independent of other relevant
prognostic factors, such as b2-m level, IGHV mutation
status, and cytogenetic abnormalities. Future studies
should focus on revealing the biologic basis for these divergent clinical outcomes.
