ABSTRACT
26S proteasomes are known as major non-lysosomal cellular machines for
coordinated and specific destruction of ubiquitinylated proteins. The proteolytic
activities of proteasomes are controlled by various post-translational modifications
in response to environmental cues, including DNA damage. Besides proteolysis,
proteasomes also associate with RNA hydrolysis and splicing. Here, we extend the
functional diversity of proteasomes by showing that they also dynamically associate
with microRNAs (miRNAs) both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. Moreover,
DNA damage induced by an anti-cancer drug, doxorubicin, alters the repertoire of
proteasome-associated miRNAs, enriching the population of miRNAs that target cell
cycle checkpoint regulators and DNA repair proteins. Collectively, these data uncover
yet another potential mode of action for proteasomes in the cell via their dynamic
association with microRNAs.

INTRODUCTION

[6]. Subsequently, the substrate proteins undergo deubiquitinylation mediated by the metalloprotease Rpn11
prior to their degradation [7, 8]. The RP consists of 19
different subunits, including six regulatory AAA-ATPase
subunits (Rpt1-6) and 13 regulatory non-ATPase subunits
(Rpn1-3, Rpn5-13, and Rpn15). The AAA-ATPases form
a hexameric ring that unfolds substrates using the energy
of ATP. This step is important for efficient entering the
amino-terminal end of the target protein into a narrow
channel of the 20S CP.
Since efficient protein degradation is critical for cell
cycle progression, proteasome inhibitors are considered
to be potent anti-cancer drugs and several of them are
currently in clinical trials [9]. Bortezomib (PS431) was
the first proteasome inhibitor to be approved by FDA for
the treatment of multiple myeloma [10]. This success
made proteasomes an appealing therapeutic target and
highlighted the importance of studying the regulatory
mechanisms that control proteasome activities. Given the
fact that genotoxic stress damages many proteins, which

Proteasomes are multi-protein complexes, widely
known to participate in protein degradation by ubiquitindependent and ubiquitin-independent proteolysis. The
26S proteasome consists of the 20S catalytic particle (CP)
and the 19S regulator particle (RP). The 20S proteasome
is a barrel-shaped structure formed of four heptameric
rings: the two outer rings are made of alpha-type subunits
and the two inner rings are made of beta-type subunits.
Beta-subunits are responsible for proteolysis, while the
main function of alpha-rings is to regulate an access of a
substrate to the proteolytic chamber [1, 2].
The 19S regulatory particle is attached at either
one or both ends of the CP and is essential for substrate
recognition and preparation for destruction. Polyubiquitinylated substrates are recognised either by the
integral ubiquitin receptors subunits, Rpn10 and Rpn13
[3] [4, 5], or by the proteasome-associated factors
that also have affinity for ubiquitins (e.g. Rad23B)

should then be utilized by proteasomes, it was perhaps
not very surprising that the combinatorial treatment of
multiple myeloma patients with bortezomib and genotoxic
drugs (e.g. doxorubicin) resulted in synergistic effect [11].
Doxorubicin (DR) is an anti-cancer drug that
belongs to the family of anthracycline inhibitors of
topoisomerase II [12]. DR was reported to regulate
the ubiquitin-proteasome system [13] and enhance
the degradation of some transcription factors [14, 15].
Moreover, proteasomes were shown to interact with DR
directly and carry it from cytoplasm into the nucleus
[16]. A more detailed analysis of this phenomenon has
revealed the critical role of the 20S CP subunits in binding
doxorubicin [17].
In addition to “canonical” proteolytic activities
proteasomes also possess several “non-canonical”
activities [18]. In this respect, it is important to note
that several decades ago a number of reports described
the proteasome (at least the 20S CP) as an RNA
binding protein complex [19, 20]. Moreover, the same
group of authors was able to show that the CP is also
associated with nuclear matrix [21, 22] as well as with
the cytoskeleton [23]. Interestingly, these 20S CP, or
prosomes, displayed RNase activities [24, 25]. Subsequent
studies have identified the alpha5 subunit of CP as the one

possessing RNAse activity. The latter can be regulated
by various post-translational modifications in response
to different environmental cues [18, 26]. Finally, the
work from our group indicates that proteasomes may be
involved in regulation of alternative splicing [27].
That proteasome preparations often contain small
RNA species ranging from 20 to 120 nucleotides [28]
prompted us to test whether proteasome-associated RNAs
(pa-RNAs) belonged to the family microRNAs (miRNAs).
Given the fact that DNA damage controls both proteolytic
and endonuclease activities of proteasomes, we also
examined how genotoxic stress induced by DR affected
the repertoire of these small RNAs associated with the
proteasome.

RESULTS
Doxorubicin elicits apoptosis in K562 cells.
We and others have shown previously that
proteasomes co-purify with a fraction of RNA species
ranging from 1000 to 18-20 nucleotides [28, 29]. In
fact, the abundance of the RNA fraction associated with

proteasomes was calculated and varied from 0.0016%
up tо 0.2% of total RNA depending on the organism and
specific tissue used for experiments [30]. We wanted to
test whether genotoxic stress, known to regulate both
proteolytic and RNAse activities of proteasomes, also
affected the binding of RNA to proteasomes. To address
this, we first determined the conditions of genotoxic stress
that caused apoptosis in K562 cells, a promyelocytic
leukemia cell line with high proteasome content. To
this end, we treated or non-treated cells with 4 uM of
doxorubicin (DR) for 24 hours. As evident from the
FACS analysis data (Fig. 1A), such treatment caused a
significant fraction of cells to undergo apoptosis compared
to the non-treated cells (26.4% versus 5.6%, respectively).
Furthermore, annexin V staining of the same pair of
samples showed higher intensity in the case of treated cells
versus the non-treated ones (Fig. 1B). Thus, we concluded
that the concentration of 4 uM of DR was sufficient to
induce DNA damage-induced apoptosis in K562 cells.

Therefore we used these experimental conditions of
genotoxic stress for our future experiments.

Purified proteasomes are associated with low
molecular weight RNA species.
Next, we analysed the effect of DNA damage on the
composition of 26S proteasomes (Fig. 2A). In agreement
with the previously published data we did not detect gross
changes in the composition of proteasomes purified from
cells treated or non-treated with DR, although several
subunits exhibited abnormal mobility in the gel due to
post-translational modifications [26]. To visualise the
spectra of RNA associated with proteasomes from nontreated and DR-treated cells the proteasome-associated
RNA (pa-RNA) was extracted from the respective
proteasome preparations and was subsequently endlabelled with [5’-P32] pCp in the presence of T4 RNA

was a contamination resulting from insufficient purity of
samples we also extracted RNA from the highly affinitypurified preparation of proteasomes from both K562 and
HEK293 cells (Fig. 2B). As can be judged from both
non-labelled (Fig. 2C) and radioactively-labelled images
(Fig. 2D) pa-RNA species ranged from 150 to 10-15
nucleotides (nt) in all three samples analysed. Moreover,
despite all three samples contained common pa-RNA
species of approximate size of 110 and 80 nt, they were
quite different otherwise (Fig. 2D). The most pronounced
differences between pa-RNAs from the DR-treated and
non-treated cells were observed in the regions between
100 and 150 nt and 15 to 50 nt.

cells non-treated or treated with DR. Thus, we isolated
pa-RNAs from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of K562
cells non-treated and treated with DR. Next, the resulting
pa-RNAs were labelled and hybridized to the custommade miRNA expression arrays [31] (Fig. 3). The results
of microarray analysis confirmed the presence of miRNAs
in the samples of purified proteasomes. Surprisingly, we
detected a number of pa-miRNAs both in the nucleus and
cytoplasm of both K562 and HEK293 cell lines (Fig. 3
and data not shown). Furthermore, DR treatment elicited
specific changes in the levels of several pa-miRNAs
purified from both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (e.g.
let-7, miR-103, miR-625, miR-634, and miR-944).

Validation of pa-miRNA presence in different cell
types by (Q)RT-PCR.

Microarray analysis reveals a number of
miRNAs associated with proteasomes in a cell
compartment- and DR-specific manner.

To confirm the validity of our microarray findings,
we selected several pa-miRNA genes and validated
their expression by QRT-PCR using specific primers
(Fig. 4). Consistent with the microarray experimental
data, expression levels of members of the let-7 family
miRNAs were up-regulated in the pa-miRNA samples
purified from K562 DR-treated cells compared to the ones
purified from non-treated cells (Fig. 4A). In addition,
miR-103, whose expression is known to be increased
upon DNA damage, associated with nuclear proteasomes
more avidly in cells treated with DR compared to the
non-treated cells (Fig. 4A). Similarly, we detected higher

The fact that pa-RNAs from DR-treated versus nontreated cells differed significantly in their low molecular
weight species prompted us to explore whether these
RNAs belonged to non-coding miRNAs. To address this
question, we decided to employ microarray analysis using
custom prepared arrays of micro-RNA available from
miRBase v9.6 (http://www.mirbase.org/). Furthermore, if
true, we wanted to compare the spectra of proteasomeassociated miRNAs (pa-miRNAs) isolated from different
cellular compartments (nucleus versus cytoplasm) of

contents of miR-625 and miR-944 in proteasomes purified
from the DR-treated cells. On the contrary, the level of
pa-miR-634 slightly diminished upon DNA damage in
K562 cells. It is important to note that several miRNAs
exhibited differential association with cytoplasmic versus
nuclear proteasomes irrespective of DNA damage (e.g.
miR-620, miR-339, miR-1301). These results suggest that
proteasomes, depending on the intracellular localisation,
may be exposed to different pools of miRNAs.
Alternatively, miRNAs are introduced to proteasomes by
different accessory factors in cytoplasm compared to the
nucleus.
To examine whether proteasomes bind specific
miRNAs irrespective of the cellular context, we compared
the expression levels of several pa-miRNAs isolated from
proteasomes prepared from two different cell lines, K562
and HEK293, which represent suspension and adherent
cells, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Most of pa-miRNAs tested
were present in both preparations. Yet, it should be noted
that the amounts of pa-miRNAs from HEK293 cells were
consistently higher compared to the ones from K562. One
exception was miR-634, which was significantly lower in
the pa-miRNA fraction from HEK293 cells compared to

the one from K562 cells.
We assumed that these variations may be due the
difference in expression levels of specific miRNAs
in these cell lines. If one assumes that miRNAs bind
proteasomes non-specifically, then there should be a
direct correlation between the intracellular levels of such
miRNAs and their presence in the proteasome fraction.
To test this hypothesis, we compared cellular levels of
miRNAs let-7, miR-103, miR-625, miR-634, miR-659
and miR-944 in HEK293 and K562 cells treated or nontreated with DR and correlated their amounts with their
relative content in the pa-miRNA fractions (Fig. 4C).
Importantly, we observed no obvious correlation between
the cellular levels of particular miRNAs and their amounts
associated with proteasomes (compare Fig. 4B and 4C).
For example, cellular levels of miR-625 and miR-944 in
HEK293 cells are lower than in K562 cells but were 5-fold
more abundant in the pa-miRNA fraction compared to the
matching sample from K562 cells. Collectively, these
results confirmed our notion that proteasomes specifically
interact with a defined pool of miRNAs irrespective of
their cellular abundance.

maximal gap of two intermediates (triangles). Connecting metabolites are shown as circles. Only those pa-miRNAs were scored as affected

different probes.

The bioinformatics analysis of pa-miRNAs targets
reveals preference for several DNA Damage
Response pathways.

CCNE1, CDC25A, CCND1, CDK4, and CDK6 was
enriched with much higher (p<0.01) statistical confidence
compared to other networks. These results suggest that
the pa-miRNAs fraction is enriched with miRNAs that
target cell cycle regulators. Other gene networks include
“signalling by NGF”, “integrin cell surface interactions”,
“DNA repair” and “DNA replication”. All of these gene
networks are affected by DNA damage suggesting that
miRNA associated with proteasomes may be a part of
global DNA Damage Response (DDR).
Specifically, NGF signalling is known to protect
neuronal and hematopoetic cells from cell death [35].
By the same token, integrin cell surface interactions
network is connected to DNA damage-induced apoptosis.
Integrins regulate diverse pathways including activation
of protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, lipid
kinases, and small GTPases [36]. It has been shown that
in some cell types that survive in suspension, detachment
from the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) decreases cell death
in response to DNA damage. The mechanism involves
integrin-dependent changes in the Arf protein and
correlates with genetic instability [37].
Another pathway (DNA repair) involves Rad23B
and CCNH target genes. In addition to its role in DNA
repair, Rad23B serves as an adapter module between the

Finally, we wanted to find out whether there is a
specific pathway(s) that might be targeted by DR-regulated
pa-miRNAs. To this end, we employed a bioinformatics
approach. First, using experimentally verified targets
of pa-miRNAs retrieved with MIRTARBASE software
(http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw) we generated a list
of potential gene targets [32] for these miRNAs (Table
2). Next, we used the algorithm called R-spider [33, 34],
which is based on the statistical framework that analyses
united Reactome signalling and KEGG metabolic
networks for gene- and gene-metabolite interactions. The
aim of this statistical analysis was to connect maximal
number of genes derived from Table 2 into statistically
significant gene networks with maximum of two missing
genes in each pathway (Fig. 5). Nineteen genes targeted
by pa-miRNAs affected by DR could be connected into
five networks with statistical confidence better than 0.05
based on the Monte-Carlo simulation of random gene
entries (Fig. 5). Notably, the “cell cycle checkpoints”
gene network including CHEK1, WEE1, TP53, CDK2,

poly-ubiquitinylated substrate proteins and proteasomes
[38, 39]. The “DNA replication” network is represented
by two genes: KIF23, a kinesin family member, and
PLK1 kinase are both targets of DNA damage mitotic
checkpoints, which also participate in mitosis [40]. In
line with this, most of the pa-miRNA target genes belong
to the group of cell cycle checkpoints genes (Fig. 5).
Importantly, the target genes are involved in both G1/S
(CCNE1, CDK2, CCND1, CDK4, CDK6, and CDKN2C
(p18/INK4c)) and G2/M (CDC25A, Wee1) control. It
should be noted that Chek1 regulates both intra-S and
G2/M checkpoints [41, 42]. Thus, it can be concluded
that the majority of pa-miRNA’s target genes are involved
in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints and cell cycle
progression.

and proteasomes might be non-specific. However, if it
is non-specific, then the profile of miRNAs associated
with the proteasome fraction should mirror the profile of
most abundantly expressed miRNAs in the cell. However,
this was not the case, as no appreciable correlation was
observed between the intracellular levels of miRNAs
and their levels found associated with proteasomes
(Fig. 4C). While comparing pa-miRNAs from different
cell lines we noticed a core set of miRNAs that bound
proteasomes irrespective of the cellular context, which
further argues against the non-specific binding of miRNAs
to proteasomes.
What is the molecular basis for interactions between
miRNAs and proteasomes? It is plausible that miRNAs
bind specific subunits of the 26S complex directly. In
fact, our in vitro data indicate that certain individual
alpha type subunits of the 20S complex can interact with
miRNAs. However, we do not favour this scenario, given
that the 20S complex has a strong net negative charge
which should repulse also negatively charged molecules
of miRNAs. Instead, we hypothesize that miRNAs are
specifically targeted to proteasomes by miRNA binding
proteins either directly or via yet additional accessory
factors. One possibility is that these interactions might
be mediated via the heat shock chaperon proteins. For
example, both RISC miRNA processing complex and 26S
proteasome require Hsp90 chaperon for their assembly
and maintenance [43, 44]. It has been shown that Hsp90
stabilized Argonautes proteins of the RISC complex before
binding RNA thus facilitating efficient loading of small

DISCUSSION
That proteasomal 20S particles were associated with
low molecular weight (lmw) RNA species has been known
for decades [19, 20, 28, 30]. However, neither the exact
composition nor the function(s) of these lmw RNAs were
characterised in details. In this report we demonstrate for
the first time that at least some portion of these lmw RNAs
belong to miRNAs and that genotoxic stress regulates the
association of miRNAs with proteasomes.
Since the proteasome is a large multi-subunit
complex with several enzymatical activities, including
the endoribonuclease one (for review see [1, 2]), it is
therefore possible that the association between miRNAs

Figure 6:A model of possible interaction mechanisms between 26S proteasomes and miRNAs. In cytoplasm, proteasomes may
interact with miRNA via HSP90, which, in turn, binds the miRNA-processing complex, Dicer. In the nucleus, proteasomes may associate
with miRNAs via similar mechanism (left), or through interactions with other proteins (e.g. p53 or DDX5), thereby recruiting additional
miRNA-processing complexes (Drosha). The composition of proteasome bound with miRNAs in the nucleus is not clear.

RNA [43]. Moreover, the Hsp90 protein binds directly to
the N-terminus of overexpressed mammalian Ago2 and
stabilizes Dicer interactions with Ago2 [45, 46]. On the
other hand, Hsp90 plays an important role in the assembly
and maintenance of the 26S proteasome [47]. This protein
is also instrumental for transporting the proteasome from
cytoplasm to the nucleus [48]. Using a cell-free nuclear
reconstitution system, Savulescu et al (2011) [48] found
that the 20S CP species that was actively imported through
nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to the nucleoplasm
contained Hsp90 compared to other CP species that could
not be delivered to the nucleoplasm. These data are
consistent with the data published earlier that proteasomes
are highly enriched with Hsp90 proteins [49]. Our own
observations that the alpha7 (PSMA3) subunit of the
20S complex interacts with Hsp90 are in line with this
hypothesis [27]. Taking these facts together, it is likely that
26S proteasomes interact via Hsp90 with RISC complexes
loaded with miRNAs and hence gain access to the pool of
different miRNAs.
However, in addition to the Hsp90/RISC axis, other
proteins may mediate interactions between miRNAs and
proteasomes. For example, several transcription factors
that include p53 and SMAD family members were shown
to bind the miRNA processing complex, Drosha [50] [51,
52]. On the other hand, these transcription factors undergo
ubiquitylation and hence may interact with proteasomes
[53, 54]. Therefore, it is plausible that they can also
mediate indirect recruitment of miRNA to proteasomes.
Future studies should address this important question.
Finally, our results unequivocally suggest that the
DR-induced genotoxic stress affects the composition of
miRNAs in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of
proteasomes. It is conceivable that genotoxic stress may
affect the interactions of proteasomes with Hsp90 and/or
specific miRNA-binding proteins (Fig. 6). Alternatively,
the difference in pa-miRNA assortment conferred by
genotoxic stress can be attributed to the cell cyclerestricted expression of certain miRNAs. Accordingly,
DR treatment of K562 cells phase may facilitate the
over-representation of G2/M-specific miRNAs in the pawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

miRNA fraction (Fig. 1).
Importantly, our bioinformatics data indicate that
pa-microRNAs can be allocated to several gene networks.
Noteworthy, all of these networks are connected to DNA
damage response, which points to a potential biological
role of pa-miRNAs during genotoxic stress (Fig. 6). Future
studies should address this important question.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

were purchased from the Russian Cell Culture Collection
(Institute of Cytology, St. Petersburg, Russia). K562 cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and gentamycin. HEK293

grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM),

were generated by retroviral transfection with pQCXIPPSMD14-HTBH vector (kindly provided by Dr. L.Huang)

hours.

Cell cycle and apoptosis assay
To study cell cycle distribution, cells were
harvested, washed with the PBS and permeabilized for
30 min with 0.01% saponin. Cells were washed with PBS
and incubated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 50 mg/ml
propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at 37 °C prior to analysis
with an ATC300 cytometer (Brucker).
To determine the extent of apoptosis, cells were
harvested, washed with the PBS and stained with FITCconjugated annexin V and PI using the Annexin V kit
3563

Oncotarget

(Santa Cruz) as recommended by the manufacturer.
Thereafter, samples were analyzed by flow cytometry
(Brucker) for the presence of viable (annexin V- and
PI-negative), early apoptotic (annexin V-positive, PInegative), and late apoptotic (annexin V- and PI-positive)
cells. All tests were performed in duplicate.

Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Complementary primer sequences for the
mature forms of selected miRNAs were designed based
on miRBase sequence data-base. The miRNAs analyzed
included let-7, miR-103, miR-625, miR-634, miR-659,
and miR-944. The primers used are presented in Table 2.
Real-Time quantitative (Q) PCR was performed using ABI
7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems). Normalization was
performed with U6 snRNA and mir-659 for the total RNA
and pa-miRNA, respectively. All reactions were performed
in triplicates. Relative quantification was performed using
the comparative cycle threshold (2−ΔΔCt) method.

Isolation and purification of proteasomes.
Non-treated and DR-treated K562 cells were lysed
for 40 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mM TriseHCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1x protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Proteasomes were extracted
and purified from cytosol using a multistep purification
procedure as described previously [56].
HEK293 cells with stable expression of Rpn11HTBH were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 50 mM TriseHCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM ATP,
1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche), and 0.5% NP-40. Cell lysates were incubated
with high-capacity streptavidin agarose beads (Thermo
Scientific) overnight at 4°C. Streptavidin-immobilized
proteasomes were purified as described previously[55].
For each purification batch, 10 μg of purified proteasomes
were analyzed for purity on 12% SDS-PAG.

Bioinformatics
The list of miRNA differentially associated with
proteasomes upon DR treatment was generated using
threshold of >1.5. To generate the list of target genes for
pa-miRNAs MIRTARBASE software (http://mirtarbase.
mbc.nctu.edu.tw) was used. The R-spider algorithm
implementation has been described previously [33, 34].
Statistically significant gene networks were visualized by
Medusa software (http://graph-medusa.sourceforge.net/).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

RNA manipulations.

We appreciate Dr Lan Huang (University of
California, Irvine, CA) for generously providing the
expression construct of the 19S subunit. This work was
supported by grants to N.A.B. from RFBR12-04-01024а,
MCB Program at RAS and Ministry of Education (11.
G34.31.0069).

Total RNA from cultured cells was extracted
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The proteasome-associated
RNAs (pa-RNAs) were extracted from the purified
proteasome sample as follows: treatment with pronase
(300μg/ml) and proteinase K (250μg/ml) in 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5) in the presence of 0.2% SDS at 37°C for 3
h. Next, psRNA was then isolated by phenol-chloroform
extraction and ethanol precipitation. The pa-RNA samples
were 3’ end-labelled overnight at 4°C using [5’-P32]pCp
(cytidine-3’,5’-bis- phosphate) and T4 RNA ligase in 50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl2, 3.3 mM DTT, and
10% DMSO. The resulting pa-RNAs were separated on a
8% PAG containing 8 M urea.
For microarray analysis, pa-RNAs were labelled and
hybridized to miRNA microarray chips[31] as previously
described[41]. Briefly, 2 μg of pa-RNA from each
sample was biotin labelled during reverse transcription
using random hexamers. Raw data were normalized and
analysed by GeneSpring GX software version 7.3 (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as described [57].
All microarray data were submitted as heatmaps generated
by using Stanford software [58].
Real-time reverse transcription PCR quantification
(QRT-PCR) of miRNAs were performed using 1 μg of
total RNA or 0.4 μg of pa-RNA using the miScript Reverse
Transcription Kit (Qiagen) and the miScript SYBR
