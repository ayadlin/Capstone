ABSTRACT
Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are pan-resistant to different anticancer agents
and responsible for cancer relapse. Disulfiram (DS), an antialcoholism drug, targets
CSCs and reverses pan-chemoresistance. The anticancer application of DS is limited
by its very short half-life in the bloodstream. This prompted us to develop a liposomeencapsulated DS (Lipo-DS) and examine its anticancer effect and mechanisms in vitro
and in vivo.
The relationship between hypoxia and CSCs was examined by in vitro comparison
of BC cells cultured in spheroid and hypoxic conditions. To determine the importance
of NFκB activation in bridging hypoxia and CSC-related pan-resistance, the CSC
characters and drug sensitivity in BC cell lines were observed in NFκB p65 transfected
cell lines. The effect of Lipo-DS on the NFκB pathway, CSCs and chemosensitivity was
investigated in vitro and in vivo.
The spheroid cultured BC cells manifested CSC characteristics and pan-resistance
to anticancer drugs. This was related to the hypoxic condition in the spheres. Hypoxia
induced activation of NFκB and chemoresistance. Transfection of BC cells with NFκB
p65 also induced CSC characters and pan-resistance. Lipo-DS blocked NFκB activation
and specifically targeted CSCs in vitro. Lipo-DS also targeted the CSC population in
vivo and showed very strong anticancer efficacy. Mice tolerated the treatment very
well and no significant in vivo nonspecific toxicity was observed.
Hypoxia induced NFκB activation is responsible for stemness and chemoresistance
in BCSCs. Lipo-DS targets NFκB pathway and CSCs. Further study may translate DS
into cancer therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

is a highly heterogeneous disease containing a very small
fraction (1%) of cancer stem cell (CSC) [1] population
with stem cell characters e.g. self-renewal, development
into the original tumors in immune deficient mice,
differentiation into several linages of progenies. BCSCs
can be detected by stem cell markers (ALDH+, CD24Low/
CD44High) and activation of embryonic related pathways
(Sox2, Oct4, Nanog) [2]. BCSCs are relatively quiescent

Chemoresistance is the major hindrance for the
success of advanced/metastatic BC (A/MBC) treatment.
The relapsed A/MBC is commonly pan-resistant to a wide
range of anticancer drugs, which cannot be explained by
individual genetic and biochemical resistant pathway. BC

and pan-chemoresistant [3, 4]. Conventional anticancer
drugs fail to eradicate the BCSCs, which become the
source of tumor recurrence.
Emerging evidence suggests that CSCs reside in a
hypoxic/necrotic tumorous area named the CSC niche [5].
A wide range of studies has demonstrated that hypoxia
plays pivotal roles in maintenance of the stemness of
CSCs. The hypoxia-induced CSC characteristics can
be reversed into a differentiated phenotype in normoxic
condition and vice versa. In vitro, the CSC and nonCSC phenotypes are interconversible in spheroid and
monolayer culture respectively [6, 7]. Therefore the
environmental oxygen concentration plays determinant
roles in maintaining stemness in CSCs [8]. Although
most of the publications emphasize the importance of
the hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) in induction and
maintenance of CSC phenotypes, the molecular links
between hypoxia and CSCs are still not fully elucidated.
More than 20 transcription factors including NFκB are
induced by hypoxia [9]. Hypoxia induces NFκB activation
in a wide range of cells [6]. NFκB plays important role
in cell survival, proliferation, invasion, migration and
chemoresistance [10, 11]. Human NFκB is composed
of 5 subunits [p50/p105, p52/p100, p65 (RelA), RelB
and c-Rel], which form homo- or heterodimer binding
to DNA target sites (κB sites) to influence downstream
gene expression. The most common dimer is a p50-RelA
heterodimer. In most normal cells, NFκB is sequestered in
the cytoplasm as an inactive complex through the direct
binding to its natural inhibitor, the inhibitor of NFκB
(IκB). Upon various stimuli, IκB will be phosphorylated,
ubiquitinated and promptly degraded which releases NFκB
from NFκB-IB complex. The liberated NFκB dimers are
then translocated into the nucleus and trigger a series of
molecular reactions. Hypoxic activation of NFκB pathway
may be HIF1α-dependent. HIF1α may directly interact
with NFκB proteins to promote its DNA binding activity
[12-14]. In addition to HIF-mediated activation of NFκB,
it is recently demonstrated that hypoxia can directly
induce NFκB which in turn regulates HIF pathway. The
promoter region of HIF1α contains κB site. The activation
of NFκB induced by TNFα and p50/p65 transfection
lead to increased levels of HIF1α mRNA and protein.
Therefore NF-κB can regulate HIF1α signaling pathway
to maintain the basal levels of HIF1α under normoxic
condition and further induces it under hypoxia [15, 16].
NFκB also induces HIF2α activation via influence of
the interaction between IKKγ and CBP/p300 [17, 18].
Recent studies indicate that NFκB plays a pivotal role in
hypoxia-induced CSC phenotypes and is responsible for
the chemoresistance in CSCs [19].
It is widely accepted that development of antiCSC drugs to target CSC determinant pathways will
improve chemotherapeutic outcomes. Disulfiram (DS),
a commercially available anti-alcoholism drug [20],
shows anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo [21-24].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our previous studies demonstrate that DS enhances
5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel (PTX) and gemcitabine (dFdC)
induced apoptosis in colon, breast and brain cancer cell
lines [21, 25-27]. The randomized clinical trial indicates
that in combination with chemotherapy, ditiocarb, the
derivative of DS, significantly improves the 5-year overall
survival of high risk BC patients [28]. The anticancer
activity of DS is copper (Cu) dependent [22, 29]. Cu plays
a crucial role in redox reactions and triggers the generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human cells. DS/
Cu is a strong ROS inducer [30] and proteasome-NFκB
pathway inhibitor [21, 22, 25]. DS specifically inhibits
the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), a
functional marker of CSCs and ROS scavenger [31, 32].
Combination of DS with Cu may target cancer cells by
simultaneous modulation of both ROS and NFκB. DS and
its metabolites can also permanently inhibit Pgp activity
[33].
Although the anticancer activity of DS has been
reported for a long time, only very few successful cases
have been reported in clinic [28, 34]. This discrepancy
may be mainly introduced by the very short half-life of
DS in the bloodstream. Nano-technology may be able
to extend the half-life of DS and translate it into cancer
indication. In this study, we investigated the effect of
hypoxia on CSCs and elucidated the bridging role of
NFκB in linking hypoxia and CSCs. We also examined
the in vitro and in vivo anticancer efficacy of a newly
developed liposome-encapsulated DS (Lipo-DS). Our data
indicate that NFκB plays a key role in pan-resistance of
hypoxia-induced CSCs. Lipo-DS can efficiently abolish
CSCs and reverse chemoresistance.

RESULTS
Hypoxia is responsible for maintaining stemness
and drug resistance in mammosphere (MSC) and
suspension cells (SUS)
In this study, we examined if the traditional stem cell
culture system is essential for maintaining the stemness in
vitro. Two breast cancer cell lines were cultured in both
classical serum-free spheroid stem cell culture system and
serum-rich (10%) medium in parallel. After 7 days culture,
BC cells formed typical mammospheres in both conditions.
The serum-free medium cultured cells formed numerous
relatively smaller spheres which loosely aggregated
together. In contrast, the cells cultured in the serum-rich
medium formed markedly larger and tighter spheres
(Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we compared the expression
of stem cell markers and CSC-related embryonic
proteins in these cells. Both MSCs and SUS cells have
significantly higher proportion of cells expressing stem
cell markers (ALDH+ and CD24low/CD44high) and CSC7472

related embryonic proteins (Sox2, Nanog and Oct4). In
comparison with the MSCs, most of these proteins are
expressed at higher levels in the SUS cells (Fig. 1B).
CSCs commonly possess de novo resistance to a wide
range of anticancer drugs [1]. Furthermore we examined
the chemosensitivity in these cells. Table 1 shows that
resistance of BC cells to three first line anti-BC drugs was
induced in both culture systems. These results suggest
that the stemness and chemosensitivity in BC cells were
not governed by the components in the culture medium.
It has been reported that the hypoxic condition in the stem
cell niche is essential for maintaining the stemness and
chemoresistance [6]. We hypothesized that the hypoxic
condition in the mammospheres may play the role in
maintenance of stemness and chemoresistance. Fig. 1D
and 1E demonstrate that in comparison with the adherent
cells, high population of hypoxic cells were detected in
both MSC and SUS cells by HypoxyProbe. Furthermore
we cultured both cell lines in hypoxic condition (1%
O2) for 5 days to determine the relationship between
hypoxia and MSC characteristics. Fig. 1F to 1H show
that the hypoxia-cultured monolayer cells express MSC
markers and embryonic proteins. Similar to the MSC and
SUS cells, the cells cultured in hypoxic condition are
significantly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents (Table
1). All of these data indicate that hypoxia may play a key
role in determination of stemness and chemosentivity in
BC cells.

activity were also detected in these cells (Fig. 2B and 2C).
These results indicate that NFκB may be the pivotal factor
in hypoxia-induced CSC characteristics. To examine the
importance of NFκB in maintenance of stemness and
chemosensitivity, both MCF7 and T47D cell lines were
transfected with NFκB p65 subunit. High p65 protein
levels and transcriptional activity of NFκB were detected
in the transformed clones (Fig. 2D and 2E). Fig. 2F shows
that the transformed clones possess significantly higher
(p<0.01) population of CSCs (ALDH+, CD24low/CD44high).
In comparison with the mock-transfected cells, the p65
transfected cell lines are highly resistant to three first
line anti-BC drugs [doxorubicin (Dox), PTX and dFdC]
(Table 1). These data suggest that NFκB plays a key role
in hypoxia-induced CSCs and chemoresistance.

Lipo-DS targets CSCs in vitro
CuCl2 (10µM) was used in all the experiments
because Cu is essential for DS induced cytotoxicity [21,
27, 35]. Lipo-DS/Cu was highly cytotoxic to MSCs (Fig.
3A) although these cells are resistant to conventional antiBC drugs (Table 1). Lipo-DS/Cu induced and inhibited
expression of Bax and Bcl2 proteins respectively (Fig.
3B). The sphere-forming ability was also completely
abolished after 4 hours exposure to Lipo-DS/Cu but
not Lipo-DS and Cu alone (Fig. 3C). The ALDH+ and
CD24low/CD44high CSC population in the mammospheres
was eliminated by Lipo-DS/Cu but not Lipo-DS, Cu and
anti-BC drugs (Fig. 3D and 3E). Four ALDH isoenzymes
(1A1, 1A3, 2 and 3A1) are most possible to be involved in
the ALDH activity in CSCs [32, 36-38]. The mRNA and
protein of these isoenzymes were examined to determine
if Lipo-DS also inhibits ALDH at transcriptional and
translational levels. Although most of the previous
publications mentioned that ALDH1A1 is responsible for
ALDH activity in CSCs, we could not detect its expression
in both attached and sphere-cultured MCF7 and T47D

cells. ALDH2, a mitochondria-located isoenzyme, was
expressed at background levels and not induced in CSCs.
In contrast, the mRNA and protein of ALDH1A3 and 3A1
were expressed at very low levels in the attached cells
and markedly induced by MSC culture (Fig. 3F and 3G).
Therefore ALDH1A3 and 3A1 may contribute to the high
ALDH activity in the CSCs derived from MCF7 and T47D
cell lines. Although Lipo-DS/Cu inhibited ALDH activity

but it had no effect on the mRNA and protein expression
of these 4 isoenzymes.

[21]. In this study, we examined the effect of Lipo-DS/
Cu on MSCs. Lipo-DS/Cu induced ROS activity in
MSCs was reversed by NAC, a ROS inhibitor. NAC also
reversed Lipo-DS/Cu induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 4A and
B). In comparison with normal cell lines, Lipo-DS/Cu
selectively induced higher ROS activity and cytotoxicity
in cancer cells (Fig. 4C and 4D). After exposure to
Lipo-DS/Cu for one hour, the clonogenicity in cancer
cell lines was completely abolished but no significant
effect was observed in Lipo-DS/Cu treated normal cells
(MCF10A and HeCV)(Fig. 4E). After exposure to LipoDS/Cu for 4 hours, the major MAPK pathway elements,
e.g. phosphorylated JNK, phosphorylated C-JUN and
phosphorylated p38 but not ERK, were significantly
induced (Fig. 4F). In contrast to the MAPK pathway, LipoDS/Cu inhibited IκBα degradation and blocked NFκB p65
nuclear translocation in both MCF7 and T47D CSCs. The
phosphorylation of NFκB p65 and AKT in the MSCs was
also inhibited by Lipo-DS/Cu (Fig. 4G and 4H).

stem cell culture system. The serum-free and growth
factors-supplemented spheroid culture has been widely
used as a gold method in vitro to prevent differentiation,
purge the differentiated progenies and enrich stem cell
population [41]. In contrast to the relatively nonreversible
differentiation in normal stem cells, the monolayercultured non-CSCs and sphere-cultured CSCs are
completely reversible [6, 41]. In comparison with the
stem cell culture system, the serum-rich suspended
culture system is less costly and has better physiological
relevance. In this study, we compared the BC cells cultured
in traditional serum-free stem cell medium and serum-rich
(10% FCS) medium to determine the necessity of the stem
cell medium in maintaining the CSC status. After 6 days
culture, the BC cells in both systems formed spheres and
clusters (Fig. 1A). It is widely accepted that if it is not a
single cell inoculation, the aggregation of the suspended
cells is inevitable, no matter how low the cell density ([41]
and our unpublished data). Therefore, these spheres and
clusters represent both cell proliferation and aggregation.
The expression of stem cell and embryonic markers
was significantly induced in the cells cultured in both
systems. This result indicates that the stemness was not
determined by the components in the culture medium. If
so, there must be some common feature(s) in the culturing
systems which introduce and maintain stemness. Hypoxia
is a determinant of stemness in stem cell niche [6]. We
hypothesized that due to the penetrating distance hypoxia
may be cumulated within the spheres. The cells located in
the center of the spheres will show CSCs’ characteristics.
Compared with the monolayer-cultured cells, a high
population of hypoxic cells was detected in the spherecultured cells (Fig. 1D and E). More hypoxic cells were
detected in serum-containing spheres. This may be due to
that these spheres are significantly bigger and tighter than
those in serum-free culture (Fig. 1A). A high population of
CSCs was also detected in hypoxia-cultured (<1% O2) BC
cells. The BC cells cultured in these three conditions are
highly resistant to dFdC, Dox and PTX. Chemoresistance
is another common feature of CSCs. These results indicate
that the stem cell characters in the sphere-cultured cells
may be introduced by hypoxia. The serum-free and growth
factors-supplemented medium is not essential for the in
vitro CSC culture.
Although hypoxia can induce stem cell characters,
the detailed molecular mechanisms and pathways
linking hypoxia and CSCs are still largely unknown.
It is generally believed that hypoxia-activated HIF
pathways are important for cellular response to hypoxia
[6]. However, many other transcription factors, e.g.
NFκB, are also crucial for hypoxia-induced phenotypes.
Activation of NFκB pathway enables the survival of the
inflammatory cells in inflammation-induced hypoxia [6].
Recent studies indicate that NFκB also plays a pivotal
role in CSCs and chemoresistance [42-44]. In our study,

Disulfiram inhibits BC xenografts in vivo
Furthermore, the anticancer efficacy of LipoDS was examined in vivo. The drug was administered
3 times/week for successive 3 weeks. To determine the
necessity of copper supplement in vivo, the Lipo-DS i.v
with/without copper supplement and copper alone were
compared. The oral administration of DS/copper gluconate
(CuGlu) was compared with i.v administration of LipoDS plus oral administration of CuGlu. In comparison with
the control group, both Lipo-DS/CuGlu and Lipo-DS
significantly inhibited tumor growth but Lipo-DS/CuGlu
demonstrated highest anticancer efficacy (Fig. 5A and
5B). Oral administration of DS/CuGlu also showed tumor
inhibiting effect although it is not statistically significant.
Copper alone had no effect on tumor growth. Lipo-DS/
CuGlu, Lipo-DS and DS/CuGlu induced BAX, inhibited
Bcl-2 and induced TUNEL staining (Fig. 5C and 5D). In
comparison with the control group, the ALDH expression
in tumor tissues was inhibited when the animal were
treated with Lipo-DS/CuGlu and Lipo-DS (Fig. 5C). It
seems that Lipo-DS/CuGlu had no effect on proliferation
because the expression of Ki67 was not affected by the
treatments. Administration of CuGlu with or without DS
or Lipo-DS induced moderate dilation of blood vessels in
the examined organs. No cytotoxic effect was observed
in lung and kidney but some necrotic cells were observed
in the liver of Lipo-DS/CuGlu treated animals (Fig. 5E).

DISCUSSION
Since Al-Hajj identified CSCs in BC [39], the
existence of CSCs has been reported in several other
cancer types and in developed cancer cell lines [40].

was detected in sphere- and hypoxia-cultured cells.
These cells also demonstrated IκBα degradation and p65
phosphorylation. The activation of AKT, the transcription
factor upstream of NFκB, was also observed. High NFκB
DNA binding activity was induced in all three conditions.
Therefore NFκB pathway is activated in all of the three
culture systems (MSC, SUS and hypoxia). In order to
examine the importance of NFκB in determination of
CSC traits, we transfected BC cells with NFκB p65. The
transfected clones expressed high levels of BCSC markers
(Fig. 2F) and were highly resistant to dFdC, Dox and PTX
(Table 1). Therefore NFκB definitely conferred CSC traits
upon BC cells.
DS is an NFκB inhibitor which targets CSCs
and reverses chemoresistance [21, 25, 27, 35, 45]. The
application of DS in cancer therapeutics is limited by its
very short half-life in the bloodstream [46]. To overcome
this hindrance, we recently developed a Lipo-DS to extend
the half-life of DS in the bloodstream [47]. In line with
our previous reports [21, 27], the cytotoxicity of Lipo-DS
is Cu dependent. After very short exposure (4 hours) to
Lipo-DS/Cu, the expression of BCSC markers (ALDH+,
CD24low/CD44high) in the sphere cells was inhibited and the
sphere-forming ability in the BC cell lines was completely
abolished. The BCSC markers were not affected by
conventional anticancer drug, Lipo-DS or Cu. Although it
was reported that ALDEFLOUR detects enzyme activity
of ALDH1A1 [32], we could not detect ALDH1A1
mRNA and protein expression in both cell lines. ALDH2,
a mitochondrial isoenzyme, was detected at very low basal
levels but not induced by spheroid and hypoxic culture.
Marcato et al. [36] reported that ALDH1A3 is responsible
for the high ALDH activity in BC. Our study indicates
that both ALDH1A3 and 3A1 may be responsible for the
high ALDH activity in BCSCs because high and inducible
expression of ALDH1A3 and 3A1 mRNA and proteins
was detected in sphere-cultured cells. Lipo-DS/Cu had no
effect on ALDH isoenzymes (1A1, 1A3, 2 and 3A1) at
mRNA and protein levels.
Selectivity is one of the key issues for anticancer
drug development. The cytotoxicity of Lipo-DS/Cu is ROS
dependent. ROS induces apoptosis by damaging DNA,
RNA and protein. Cancer cells possess and also tolerate
significantly higher levels of ROS due to the balance of
anti-apoptotic mechanisms e.g. NFκB [48]. Lipo-DS/Cu
selectively induced ROS activity and showed significantly
higher cytotoxicity in BC than normal cell lines. Similar
phenomenon was also obtained by clonogenic assay (Fig.
4E). ROS induced-apoptosis is highly MAPK pathwaydependent. Lipo-DS/Cu persistently activated JNK, C-Jun
and p38 MAPK pathways but had no effect on ERK
pathway which is responsible for cell growth, proliferation
and survival [49]. ROS also trigger the expression of
anti-apoptotic proteins which in turn neutralize the proapoptotic effects of ROS [48]. NFκB is one of the most
important ROS-induced anti-apoptotic factors [48]. NFκB
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibits JNK and p38 activation and suppresses ROS
accumulation in cancer cells [48, 50]. Cancer cell fate is
highly dependent on the crosstalk between JNK/p38 and
NFκB pathways. Simultaneous activation of ROS-JNK/
p38 and inhibition of NFκB pathway (Fig. 4F – 4H) may
contribute to Lipo-DS/Cu induced cytotoxicity in the BC
cell lines.
In this study, we first reported the anticancer
effect of Lipo-DS in combination with copper in vivo.
Lipo-DS/CuGlu demonstrated the strongest anticancer
efficacy. Lipo-DS injection alone also showed anticancer
activity although lower than that of Lipo-DS/CuGlu. This
may be due to the intrinsic copper in plasma and tumor
tissues [51]. Oral version of DS/Cu showed mild in vivo
anticancer activity. The Lipo-DS, Lipo-DS/Cu and DS/Cu
induced apoptosis was evidenced by TUNEL and western
blotting results (Fig. 6C and 6D). Consistence with our in
vitro data ([21] and unpublished data) Ki67 staining (Fig.
6C) indicates that the anticancer effect of DS and LipoDS is proliferation-independent. In line with the in vitro
data, Lipo-DS inhibited the ALDH+ CSC population in the
xenografts (Fig. 6C). To determine the in vivo selectivity
DS, the histo-pathological changes of vital organs (liver,
lung and kidney) were examined (Fig. 6E). CuGlu
induced blood congestion in major organs. There was no
significant toxicity observed in the vital organs except that
some necrotic cells were observed in the liver of LipoDS/Cu treated mice. Our unpublished data indicate that
in combination with Cu, the in vivo anticancer effect of
nano-encapsulated DS could be achieved at significantly
lower dose with no toxicity in liver. Therefore the dose
of Lipo-DS in Lipo-DS/CuGlu group still needs to be
adjusted. After very short exposure (1 hour) in vitro,
Lipo-DS showed high selectivity and strong irreversible
cytotoxicity in cancer cells. This phenomenon gives us
a further indication that development of long-circulating
formulation of DS may translate this drug into clinical
cancer therapeutics.

loading content of Lipo-DS is 3mg/ml. The cumulative
release of DS from liposome in 120h is more than 60%.
The pharmacokinetic study of DSF in rat plasma after
intravenous administration of a dose of 36 mg/kg has been
investigated (t1/2 =0.1 h and t1/2d=0.3 h). The comparison of
the biological activity between Lipo-DS and conventional

with FITC-conjugated anti-hypoxyprobe MAb. The CSCs
and cells in suspending condition were cultured for 6 days.
The MSCs and suspension-cultured cells were labelled
with Hypoxyprobe for 24 hours and cytospined at 800
rpm for 3 min to spread the spheres onto Polylysine-coated
slides (VWR, Lutterworth, UK). For flow cytometric
analysis, the cells were cultured in 25cm flasks at the
above conditions. After immunocytochemistry staining
the cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The
hypoxic population was detected using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer with 488-nm blue laser and standard FITC
530/30 nm bandpass filter. To determine the effect of
hypoxia on drug sensitivity, the cells were cultured in 1%
oxygen condition at a cell density of 1×103 cells/well in
96-well plate for 4 days and exposed to anticancer drugs
for another 72 h before MTT assay. The parallel MTT
assay was performed in normoxic condition.

Cell culture and cytotoxicity analysis
All cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Lonza,
Wokingham, UK) supplemented with 10% FCS,
2mM L-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml
streptomycin. For in vitro cytotoxicity assay, the cells
(5,000/well) were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed
microtiter plates overnight and exposed to anticancer
drugs or Lipo-DS plus CuCl2 (10µM) for 72 h, then
subjected to a standard MTT assay [54].

Detection of ALDH positive population

In vitro mammosphere and suspension culture
and cytotoxicity assay

The ALDH positive population was detected by
ALDEFLUOR kit (StemCell Tech., Durham, NC, USA)
following the supplier’s instruction. The cells (2.5 × 105)
were analyzed after stained in ALDH substrate containing
assay buffer for 30 min at 37°C. The negative control
was treated with diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), a
specific ALDH inhibitor.

To culture the BC spheres, cells were cultured in
poly-HEMA coated ultra-low adherence flasks or plates
to prevent cell adhesion. The spheres were cultured, at a
density of 10,000 cells/ml, as MSCs or suspension cells
(SUS) in stem cell culture medium [SCM, serum-free
DMEM-F12 supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen, Paisley,
UK), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF, Sigma),
10 ng/ml basic fibroblasts growth factor (b-FGF, R &
D System, Abingdon, UK), 10 µg/ml insulin (Sigma)]
and full medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS,
2mM L-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml
streptomycin) respectively. After 6 days culture, the MSC
and SUS cell clusters and spheres were photographed and
subjected to further treatments. For in vitro cytotoxicity
assay, the MSC or SUS cultured cells were trypsinised and
seeded in 96-well plated at a density of 5,000 cells/well
and exposed to drugs for 72 h before MTT assay. CuCl2
(10 µM) supplemented culture medium was used in the
MTT assay to determine the cytotoxicity of Lipo-DS in
MSC and SUS.

Flow cytometric analysis of CD24 and CD44
expression
The adherent or mammosphere cells were
trypsinised and passed through a 25G needle. The
cells (2.5 × 105) were incubated with CD24 and CD44
antibodies (BD Pharmingen, Oxford, UK) for 20 min
at 4°C. Unbound antibodies were washed off with 2%
FCS HBSS (Sigma) and the cells (10,000 events) were
examined no longer than 1 hour after staining on a BD
Facscalibur.

Immunofluorescent flow cytometric analysis of
embryonic stem cell markers

Measurement of hypoxia in cell culture

The expression of Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 was
determined by immunofluoresent flow cytometry. The
sphere and hypoxia-cultured cells were collected by
trypsinization. The cells fixed by acetone/methanol
and permeabilized by 0.1% triton-X100. After blocked
with 3% BSA for 1 hour the cells were stained with
primary (1:50 dilution) and FITC-conjugated secondary
antibodies respectively for 1 hour at RT. The positively
stained population was detected using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer with 488-nm blue laser and standard FITC
530/30 nm bandpass filter.

The hypoxic status was determined using the
HypoxyprobeTM-1 Plus Kit supplied by Hypoxyprobe
Inc (Burlington, MA, USA) following the supplier’s
instruction. For immunocytochemistry assay, the cells
were cultured in 8-well chamber slides at normoxic (20%
oxygen) or hypoxic [1% oxygen in Hypoxic Chamber
(StemCell, Durham, NC, USA)] condition for 24 hours
and labeled with Hypoxyprobe for 2 hours. The hypoxic
cells were detected by confocal microscope after stained

well) [pNFκB-Tal-Luc (BD Biosciences) and pGL3Basic (Promega, Southampton, UK)] were co-transfected
with 0.008 µg/well pSV40-Renilla (Promega) DNA, an
internal control for normalization of the transcriptional
activity of the reporter vectors. Twenty-four hours
after transfection, the cells were lysed and luciferase
activity was determined using Dual Luciferase Assay kit
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The luciferase activity in each well was normalized to
pSV40-Renilla using Ln = L/R (Ln: normalized luciferase
activity; L: luciferase activity reading; R: Renilla activity
reading). The transcriptional specificity was monitored
by the transcriptional activity of the pGL3-Basic. All
transfections were performed in triplicate with at least
duplicate independent experiments.

The protein expression levels were determined
by staining with primary antibodies and relevant
HRP conjugated secondary (1:5000, Armersham,
Buckinghamshire, UK) antibodies. The primary
antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA, USA: Bcl2, Bax, p65, IκBα,
nucleolin, ALDH1A1, 1A3, 3A1, 2 and cleaved PARP;
Novus Bio, Cambridge, UK: HIF2; Abcam, Cambridge,
UK: phosphorylated p65_S276; Cell Signaling, Herts,
UK: AKT, phosphorylated AKT, Sox2, Oct4, JNK,
phosphorylated JNK, cJun, phosphorylated cJun,
phosphorylated p38, ERK) were diluted at 1:1000 in 5%
fat-free milk-TBST. Anti-α-tubulin (1:8000, Sigma) and
nucleolin were used as a loading control. The signal was
detected using an ECL Western blotting detection kit
(GeneFlow, Staffordshire, UK).

Measurement of ROS activity

Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSA)

The intracellular ROS levels were determined using
a Total ROS Detection Kit (Enzo, Exeter, UK) following
the supplier’s instruction. Briefly, the cancer cells (2×105
cells/well) were cultured in 6-well plate until 70%
confluence. The cells were exposed to Lipo-DS (1 µM) in
combination with Cu (10 µM). Cells exposed to NAC (2
mM) were used as a negative control. After drug exposure,
the drug containing medium was discarded and the cells
were collected by trypsinization. The cell pellets were
resuspended and incubated in 500 µl of ROS Detection
Solution at 37˚C for 30 min in the dark. The ROS positive
population was detected using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer with 488-nm blue laser and standard FITC
530/30 nm bandpass filter.

Nuclear protein extraction was carried out as
previously described [21]. A double-stranded NFκB
DNA probe (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG
C-3′) was end labeled with biotin. Detection of NFκBoligonucleotide complex was performed using a LightShift
chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce, Northumberland,
UK). Briefly, nuclear protein (5 µg) was incubated with 20
fmol of biotin-labeled oligonucleotide for 20 min at room
temperature in binding buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris at
pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 2.5% glycerol, 5 mM
MgCl2, 50 ng of poly(dIdC), and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The
specificity of the NFκB DNA binding was determined in
competition reactions in which a 200-fold molar excess of
unlabeled wild type or mutant NFkB probe (5′-AGT TGA
TAT TAC TTT TAT AGG C-3′) was added to the binding
reaction. Products of binding reactions were resolved
by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. NFκBoligonucleotide complex was electroblotted onto a nylon
membrane (Amersham). After incubation in blocking
buffer for 1 hour at room temperature, the membrane
was incubated with streptavidin-HRP conjugate for 30
min at room temperature. The membrane was incubated
with chemiluminescent substrate for 5 min and exposed to
radiographic film.

Clonogenic Assay
Cells (5×104/well) were cultured in 6-well plates
overnight and then exposed to 1 µM of DS in combination
with 10µM CuCl2 for 1 h. The cells were collected and
cultured in 6-well plates containing drug-free medium
at a cell density of 2.5×103/well. Clonogenic cells were
determined as those able to form a colony consisting of at
least 50 cells after 10 days culture.

Total RNA isolation and RT-PCR

Luciferase reporter gene assay

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. The mRNA expression levels of ALDH 1A1
(NM_000689), 1A3 (NM_000693), 2 (NM_000690)
and 3A1 (NM_000691) genes were determined using
the Access RT-PCR System (Promega, Southampton,
UK) following the instruction of the supplier. The human
housekeeping gene GAPDH (XR018317) was used as
the RNA loading control. The sequences of the primers

The effect of different treatments on the
transcriptional activity of NFκB was determined by
luciferase reporter gene assays. Transfections were
performed using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK). Cells (1 × 104/well) were cultured in 96-well
plates overnight. The luciferase reporter vectors (0.8µg/

Human breast cancer xenograft experiments
Five-week-old female BALB/c Nu/Nu athymic nude
mice (Biotechology & Cell Biology Shanghai, China)
were housed under pathogen-free conditions according
to the animal care guidelines of Fourth Military Medical
University (FMMU), China. The animal experiments
were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee
of FMMU. The animal study regimen is detailed in Fig.
6. The tumor volume was calculated by the following
formula: V =(L×W2)×0.5, where L is the length and W is
the width of the tumor. The xenograft size was observed
twice per week for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks or when the
xenograft reached 1500mm3, the animals were sacrificed.
The tumors were removed, photographed and subjected to
further analysis.
