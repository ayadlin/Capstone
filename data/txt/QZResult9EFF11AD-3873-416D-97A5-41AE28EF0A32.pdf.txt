Abstract
Immunotherapy with rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, Rituxan), alone or in conjunction with
chemotherapy, has significantly improved the treatment
outcome of lymphoma patients. Via an elusive mechanism, a
subpopulation of patients becomes unresponsive and/or
relapses. To recapitulate various aspects of acquired resistance, rituximab-resistant (RR) clones were established from
lymphoma lines and compared with parental cells. Surface
CD20 expression was diminished in the clones. The clones
neither responded to rituximab-mediated growth reduction or
complement-dependent cytotoxicity nor underwent apoptosis
in response to cross-linked rituximab. Rituximab failed to
chemosensitize the RR clones, which exhibited constitutive
hyperactivation of the nuclear factor-KB and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathways, leading to overexpression of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2–related gene
(long alternatively spliced variant of Bcl-x gene), and myeloid
cell differentiation 1 and higher drug resistance. Unlike
parental cells, rituximab neither inhibited the activity of these
pathways nor diminished the expression of resistant factors.
Pharmacologic inhibitors of the survival pathways or Bcl-2
family members reduced the activity of these pathways,
diminished antiapoptotic protein expression, and chemosensitized the RR clones. These novel in vitro results denote
that continuous long-term rituximab exposure culminates in
RR clones that do not respond to rituximab-mediated effects,
have altered cellular signaling dynamics, and exhibit different
genetic and phenotypic properties compared with parental
cells. The data also reveal that although RR clones exhibit
higher resistance to rituximab and cytotoxic drugs, these
clones can be chemosensitized following treatment with
pharmacologic inhibitors (e.g., dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin, bortezomib, PD098059) that target survival/antiapoptotic pathways. The findings also identify intracellular targets
for potential molecular therapeutic intervention to increase
treatment efficacy. The significance and potential clinical
relevance of the findings are discussed. [Cancer Res 2007;

Introduction
The lymphatic cancers known as non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma
(NHL) are steadily increasing in prevalence worldwide. Although
NHLs initially respond to a variety of therapeutic modalities, they

exhibit an unremitting relapsing nature and are essentially
considered incurable. This pattern of inevitable failure of standard
therapies is due to the emergence of drug-resistant variants that
highlight the urgent need for the design of new treatment
regimens. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeted against specific
surface markers that are less systematically toxic and less
myelosuppressive have provided an alternative therapeutic approach. About 80% to 85% of NHLs are of B-cell origin and f95%
of these cells express surface CD20 (1, 2).
The B-cell–specific surface marker CD20 (3) does not circulate in
the plasma as a free protein, which could potentially block
antibody binding to the cells (4). It is also neither internalized upon
antibody ligation (5) nor is shed from the cell surface (6)—
properties that make CD20 an ideal target for immunotherapy of
NHL. The chimeric mouse anti-human CD20 mAb rituximab
(IgG1n) binds with high affinity to CD20-expressing cells. It is the
first Food and Drug Administration–approved mAb for NHL
treatment (7).
Rituximab has been an important addition to the therapeutic
armamentarium against low-grade follicular NHL (8). Furthermore,
its usefulness alone or combined with chemotherapy is considered
as first-line therapeutic option for other types of hematologic
malignancies (9–11) improving patient survival. Its usage is also
extended to other pathologic states culminating in long-lasting
response (12–15). Rituximab exerts significant antitumor activity
in vivo (1) via inhibition of cell proliferation or triggering multiple
cell-damaging mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and apoptosis (16, 17). It also augments the cytotoxic effects of drugs on
drug-resistant NHL B-cells (18). Nonetheless, the contribution of
these mechanisms on primary normal and malignant B-cells in vivo
and the molecular mechanisms of rituximab action need to be
defined.
We proposed that modifications of signaling pathways by
rituximab may be crucial for its chemosensitizing attribute. To
this end, we have recently reported that rituximab, via inhibition
of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathways, reduces Bcl-xL [B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2)–
related gene (long alternatively spliced variant of Bcl-x gene)]
expression and chemosensitizes NHL B-cells (19, 20). Activation
of NF-nB and ERK1/2 pathways are emerging as major mechanisms of tumor cell drug resistance and induce their rapid
proliferation. Thus, interruption of these pathways is a target for
therapeutic intervention and may confer drug sensitivity (21, 22),
which has proven successful in enhancing the apoptotic effects
of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and CPT-11 resulting in tumor
regression in vivo (23). Inhibition of NF-nB and ERK1/2 pathways was shown by decrease in phosphorylation and kinase
activities of the signaling molecules and reduced NF-nB and
activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA-binding ability concomitant with

Chemosensitization of Rituximab-Refractory Clones

reduction in the expression of their common downstream target
Bcl-xL (24).
The superior efficacy of cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone (CHOP) + rituximab compared with CHOP alone in
elderly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients was reported, where
the combination therapy resulted in higher rates of complete
remission and survival (2) and also increases overall survival in
aggressive Bcl-2–positive and Bcl-2–negative patients (25). Despite
its well-established clinical efficacy, a subpopulation of patients,
via an elusive mechanism, does not respond to rituximab and/or
acquires resistance upon long-term rituximab therapy (16, 17).
Based on previous reports, we hypothesized that development of
rituximab resistance may be related to failure of tumor cells to
respond to rituximab-mediated signaling. Further, the unresponsiveness of the cells to drug therapy (alone or combined with
rituximab) may be due to hyperactivation of survival signaling
pathways and up-regulation of resistant factors. Due to challenges
in obtaining patient-derived specimens for analysis, and to
recapitulate various aspects of acquired rituximab-resistant (RR)
situations, rituximab-refractory clones were generated (26). Using a
battery of functional and biochemical assays, representative clones
were compared with parental cells to examine alterations in
rituximab-mediated effects and to examine the above hypotheses.
Different RR clones have also been established and analyzed
(27). The following objectives were investigated: (a) phenotypic
and functional properties of RR clones (e.g., differences regarding
CD20 surface expression, proliferation, CDC, cross-linked rituximab-mediated apoptosis); (b) chemosensitivity of the clones and
chemosensitization by rituximab; (c) activation status of ERK1/2
and NF-nB pathways; (d) expression of Bcl-2 family members; and
(e) effects of various inhibitors of survival pathways on reversal of
chemoresistance. The results are concordant with hypotheses and
reveal that RR clones display different biochemical and functional
properties compared with wild-type (WT) cells. These differences
and potential clinical significance of the observations are
discussed.

MAPK kinase substrate-4 (amino acids 172–192) and PD098059 were
obtained from Biosource (Camarillo, CA). 2MAM-A3 was purchased from
Biomol (Plymouth, PA). Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ) was
provided by Dr. K. Umezawa (Keio University, Yokohama, Japan). Rituximab
and bortezomib were procured commercially.

Surface CD20 Expression

Cells (2  106) were washed twice with ice-cold 1 PBS and stained with
1 Ag mouse anti-human CD20 mAb (IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA)
or isotype control (pure IgG1; 20 min on ice, light protected). Then, the cells
were washed twice with ice-cold 1 PBS, stained with FITC-labeled
secondary antibody (30 min on ice, light protected), and subjected to
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.

Immunoblot Analysis
Cells (107) were grown either in complete medium or in complete
medium supplemented with various inhibitors. Cells were lysed at 4jC in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1%
NP40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmol/L NaCl] supplemented with
one tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini, Roche, Indianapolis, IN). A detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
was used to determine protein concentration. An aliquot of total protein
lysate was diluted in an equal volume of 2 SDS sample buffer, boiled for
10 min, and cell lysates were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels.
Western blot was carried out as described (28). The relative intensity of
bands, hence, the relative alterations in protein expression, was assessed by
densitometric analysis of digitized images using public domain NIH image
program.1

Assessment of Apoptosis
DNA fragmentation assay. Percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by evaluation of propidium iodide–stained preparations of cells
using an EpicXL flow cytometer. Cellular debris was excluded from analysis
by raising the forward scatter threshold, and DNA content of the intact
nuclei was recorded on a logarithmic scale (29). Percentage apoptosis is
represented as percentage of hypodiploid cells accumulated at sub-G0 phase
of the cell cycle.
Evaluation of active caspase-3 levels. Levels of active caspase-3 were
evaluated with FITC-labeled anti–active caspase-3 mAb (PharMingen, San
Diego, CA; ref. 28).

Assessment of Viable Cell Recovery

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines and Clones
CD20+ human Burkitt’s lymphoma B-cell lines Daudi and Ramos were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD). For
the generation of RR clones, WT cells were grown in the presence of
stepwise increasing concentrations of rituximab (5–20 Ag/mL for 10 weeks).
Single cells were then subjected to three consecutive rounds of limiting
dilution analysis (26). Single cells were propagated and maintained in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS;
ref. 28). Clones were supplemented with 20 Ag/mL rituximab weekly and
grown in rituximab-free medium at least 1 week before analysis. Cultures
were incubated in controlled atmosphere incubator at 37jC with saturated
humidity at 0.5  106/mL.

Reagents
Paclitaxel, cisplatin, etoposide (VP-16), Adriamycin, and vincristine were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and were diluted in DMSO. The
concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.1% in any experiment. Mouse
anti–Bcl-xL and anti–myeloid cell differentiation 1 (Mcl-1) mAbs were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti–Bcl-2
mAb was purchased from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA). Mouse anti–p-InB-a
(Ser32/36) and antiactin mAbs were obtained from Imgenex (San Diego, CA)
and Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Rabbit phosphorylated inhibitor of nB
kinase complex (IKK) a/h (Ser180/181) antibody was obtained from Cell
Signaling (Beverly, MA). Rabbit anti–p-ERK1/2 (Thr185/Tyr187) antibody,

Viable cell recovery was assessed using standard 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt (XTT) assay
kit (Roche) that measures metabolic activity of viable cells (30). Percentage
cell recovery was calculated using background-corrected reading as follows:
% cell recovery = [(absorbance of sample wells / absorbance of untreated
cells)]  100.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis
The DNA-binding abilities were evaluated using biotin-labeled oligonucleotide AP-1 (5¶-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3¶; ref. 31) and NF-nB
(5¶-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3¶) probes (32) using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) kit (Panomics, Inc., Redwood City, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ten micrograms of nuclear
extracts were subjected to denaturing 5% PAGE and were developed (19, 20).

Immunocomplex Kinase Assay
The kinase activity of IKK and MAP/ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) was
assessed by their ability to phosphorylate InB-a (Ser32/36) and MAPK kinase
substrate 4 (Thr185/Tyr187) using a slightly modified version of previous
methods (19, 20, 33).

Quantitative Real-time PCR
Samples were analyzed in triplicate with iQ SYBR Green Supermix using
iCycler Sequence Detection System (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was extracted

from 107 cells for each condition with 1 mL per sample of STAT-60
reagent and quantified by 3.1.2 NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer.
Total RNA (3 Ag) was reversed to first-stranded cDNA for 1 h at 42jC
with 200 units SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and 20 Amol/L random
hexamer primers. Amplification of 2.5 AL of cDNAs was done using
gene-specific primers. Internal control for equal cDNA loading in each
reaction was assessed using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) primers. Amplicons were resolved by 2% gels for confirmation
and were of expected size. Percentages of expression of each molecule
were calculated with the assumption that control samples were
considered as 100%.

Statistical Analysis
Assays were set up in triplicates, and results were expressed as mean F
SD. Statistical analysis and P values were calculated by a two-tailed
paired t test with a 95% confidence interval for determination of
significance of differences between treatment groups (P < 0.05, significant).
ANOVA was used to test significance among the groups using InStat 2.01
software.

Results
Phenotypic and Functional Properties of the RR
Clones
Diminished surface CD20 expression and failure to respond
to rituximab-mediated inhibition of cell growth and apoptosis following cross-linking. WT cells and Ramos-RR1 and DaudiRR1 clones were stained with isotype control (pure IgG1; Fig. 1A,
gray lines) or FITC-labeled anti-CD20 mAb (IgG1 subtype; solid
black lines) and were subjected to FACS analysis. As measured
by mean fluorescence intensity, WT cells show significant CD20
surface expression whereas the clones exhibit f40% to 50%
reduction in surface CD20 (Ramos, 468.4 F 14.0 versus 264 F 9.6;
Daudi, 346 F 11.4 versus 156.4 F 10.2). Similar results were
obtained in multiple independent experiments with other RamosRR and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma RR clones (data not shown),
suggesting that continuous rituximab treatment results in
diminished, but not complete loss of, surface CD20 expression
on RR clones.
To assess the ability of RR clones to respond to growthinhibitory effects of rituximab, both the WT and the clones were
either left untreated or treated with a predetermined concentration of rituximab for WT cells (20 Ag/mL, 24 h; ref. 34). An aliquot
(104) of cells was used in a standard XTT viability assay.
Rituximab exerts an inhibitory effect on the WT cells (Ramos,
27%; Daudi 46%), whereas it fails to reduce the growth of RR
clones (Ramos-RR1, 98%; Daudi-RR1, 106%; Fig. 1B, top). Higher
concentrations (50 or 100 Ag/mL) or longer exposure time (up
to 48 h) of rituximab did not alter the phenotype of the clones
(Fig. 1B, bottom); thus, 20 Ag/mL rituximab (24 h) was used in
subsequent studies. Results of the XTT assay were confirmed by

trypan blue dye exclusion and FACS (data not shown), which
essentially showed that rituximab fails to induce apoptosis or
inhibit cell growth in RR clones. Untreated RR clones exhibited
homotypic aggregation that remained unaffected by rituximab. In
contrast, WT cells grew as suspended nonaggregated cells, and
rituximab caused them to form clumps (Fig. 1C). These results
suggest that whereas rituximab efficiently lowers the growth rate of
the WT cells, it fails to reduce the growth of RR clones even at higher
concentrations.
Next, we assessed the ability of cross-linked rituximab to induce
apoptosis in RR clones. WT cells and the clones were pretreated
with an optimal concentration of cross-linked rituximab (50 Ag/mL
antihuman immunoglobulin + 20 Ag/mL rituximab, 24 h; ref. 35)
and were subjected to apoptosis assay. DNA fragmentation assay
for apoptosis detection in subsequent experiments was confirmed
by measuring active caspase-3 levels (ref. 28; data not shown).
Neither rituximab (Ramos-RR1, 11.0 F 0.8%; Daudi-RR1, 6.7 F
0.6%) nor the antihuman immunoglobulin (Ramos-RR1, 10.2 F
1.1%; Daudi-RR1, 12.8 F 0.5%) alone efficiently killed the
cells. However, the combination of the two agents (cross-linked
rituximab) induced significant levels of apoptosis in Ramos
(29.2 F 2.4%) and Daudi (32.8 F 2.1%) WT cells, whereas crosslinked rituximab moderately killed RR clones (Fig. 1D), suggesting
that clones have developed higher threshold (Ramos-RR1, 2.86-fold;
Daudi-RR1, 2.56-fold) and, unlike the WT cells, do not efficiently
respond to cross-linked rituximab-mediated apoptosis.
Failure to respond to CDC. The ability of rituximab to mediate
CDC in RR clones compared with the WT cells was assessed by
analyzing the percentage of dead cells that were treated with
human AB serum as source of complement (5% or 10%, 24 h). As
shown in Fig. 1E, WT cells exhibited modest sensitivity to the
cytotoxic effects of AB serum (as a function of serum concentration; Ramos, 15.5 F 1.3%; Daudi, 14.3 F 0.9%), an effect that was
significantly augmented in the presence of rituximab (Ramos,
36.9 F 1.5% versus 11.0 F 0.8%; Daudi, 29.2 F 1.6% versus
6.2 F 0.6%). There was augmentation of cytotoxicity with 10%
serum than with 5%. However, compared with WT cells, the
clones were less sensitive to human AB serum, and rituximab
failed to enhance their sensitivity (Ramos-RR1, 14.2 F 1.6% versus
7.8 F 0.6%; Daudi-RR1, 11.6 F 2.4% versus 6.6 F 1.1%). Increasing
serum concentration (15%) neither enhanced their sensitivity nor
augmented rituximab-mediated CDC of the clones (data not
shown). These results show that WT cells are sensitive to CDC,
which is enhanced by both serum levels and rituximab treatment,
whereas long-term rituximab exposure is accompanied by higher
CDC resistance in the clones (Ramos-RR1, 2.6-fold; Daudi-RR1,
2.5-fold). Moreover, rituximab fails to augment CDC.
Failure of rituximab to chemosensitize the RR clones.
Augmentation of the cytotoxic effects of drugs is an established

Figure 1. A, surface expression of CD20 on RR1 clones. Cells (2  106) were stained with 1 Ag anti-CD20 mAb (IgG1 subtype; solid black lines ) or isotype control
(pure IgG1; gray lines) and subsequently with FITC-labeled secondary antibodies and then analyzed by FACS. The intensity of surface CD20 expression was measured
by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI ; n = 3). B, rituximab inhibits the proliferation of the WT but not the RR clones. Cells were either left untreated or treated

of the above samples was examined microscopically to assess the ability of rituximab to form homotypic aggregation of the clones. D, failure of cross-linked rituximab to
induce apoptosis in RR clones. Cells (2  106) were either left untreated or treated with antihuman immunoglobulin (Ig ), rituximab, or the optimal concentration

cells. E, failure of rituximab to mediate CDC in the RR clones. Cells (2  106) were either left untreated or treated with human antibody serum (5% and 10%), rituximab,
or the combination for 24 h and subjected to propidium iodide staining (without fixing) for the percentage of dead cells. F, failure of rituximab to chemosensitize
the RR clones. Cells (2  106) were either left untreated or pretreated with various concentrations of rituximab (20, 50, and 100 Ag/mL, 24 h). Then, the cells were
washed and then grown in complete medium supplemented with paclitaxel (0.1–10 nmol/L, 18 h). Cells were then stained with propidium iodide solution, and apoptosis
was assessed by FACS. Samples were set up in duplicates. Columns, mean (n = 2); bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, significant compared with control.

Chemosensitization of Rituximab-Refractory Clones

property of rituximab (18). To assess the ability of rituximab to
chemosensitize RR clones, WT cells and the clones were pretreated
with rituximab, subsequently treated with various concentrations
of paclitaxel (0.1–10 nmol/L), and subjected to apoptosis assay.
Paclitaxel was used as a representative drug; similar results were
obtained with VP-16 and cisplatin (data not shown). Rituximab
significantly augmented the apoptotic effect of paclitaxel in WT
Ramos and Daudi cells in a concentration-dependent manner
(range 45–58% apoptosis; Fig. 1F, left). However, RR clones had
higher resistance to paclitaxel, and rituximab was incapable of
augmenting paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1F). Higher concentrations of rituximab (2.5- to 5-fold) failed to sensitize the clones
(Fig. 1F, right). These results suggest that whereas rituximab
efficiently chemosensitizes WT cells, it is incapable of chemosensitizing the clones, which suggests higher resistance of RR
clones to rituximab-mediated chemosensitization.

Development of Higher Drug Resistance in RR Clones
Because RR clones were not chemosensitized by rituximab, their
sensitivity against a battery of drugs, including paclitaxel,
vincristine, VP-16, Adriamycin, and cisplatin, was examined.
Compared with WT cells, which exhibit moderate sensitivity to
these drugs in a concentration-dependent manner, clones exhibited
higher apoptosis threshold to these drugs, albeit to varying degrees.
As such, Ramos-RR1 showed 1.54-fold (136%), 1.42-fold (130%),
2.3-fold (158%), 1.8-fold (145%), 1.41-fold (120%) and Daudi-RR1
showed 1.63-fold (139%), 1.66-fold (140%), 1.94-fold (149%), 2.97fold (167%), 1.95-fold (149%) resistance to paclitaxel, vincristine,
Adriamycin, VP-16, and cisplatin, respectively, compared with their
respective WT cells (Fig. 2A). Prolonged incubation time (48 h) did
not significantly augment drug cytotoxicity in the clones (data not
shown), suggesting that compared with WT cells, RR clones exhibit
higher (1.41- to 2.97-fold) drug resistance. Functional analysis of
the multidrug resistance (MDR) pump showed the existence of
functional MDR pump in both WT cells and the clones. Further, RR
clones exhibited no functional impairment of MDR pump
(Frituximab; data not shown), suggesting that higher drug
resistance of the clones is independent of the MDR pump.

Overexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 in RR
Clones
RR clones did not respond to rituximab-mediated chemosensitization and exhibited higher drug resistance. Previous
findings have established Bcl-xL as an important resistant factor
(19, 20); thus, we evaluated Bcl-xL levels and other antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family members in the clones. Total RNA was extracted and
converted to first stranded cDNA, which was subjected to real-time
quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. RR clones exhibited increased
expression of Bcl-2 (Ramos-RR1, 3.6-fold; Daudi-RR1, 3.2-fold),
Bcl-xL (Ramos-RR1, 8.2-fold; Daudi-RR1, 4.2-fold), Mcl-1 (RamosRR1, 3.4-fold; Daudi-RR1, 2.8-fold) at the transcription level
(Fig. 2B). Immunoblotting showed that clones exhibit higher Bcl-2,

Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 protein levels (f2.3- to 5.0-fold) compared with
WT cells. Interestingly, expression levels of these proteins remained
unaffected by rituximab treatment of the clones, whereas Bcl-xL
levels in WT cells were reduced (Fig. 2C). Notably, expression levels
of other proapoptotic and antiapoptotic factors (Bcl-xS, Bfl-1/A1,
Bad, Bax, Bid, Bak, c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2, survivin, XIAP) were similar in
WT cells and RR clones (Frituximab; data not shown). These
results show that clones express higher levels of protective factors,
which may explain their unresponsiveness to rituximab-mediated
chemosensitization and higher drug resistance. Also, rituximab
was unable to reduce the levels of resistant factors, suggesting that
signaling pathways in the clones are no longer responsive to
rituximab.

Hyperactivation of the ERK1/2 and NF-KB Signaling
Pathways in the RR Clones
The above findings suggest that the dynamics of the cellular
signaling pathways are altered in the clones. Rituximab inhibits
ERK1/2 and NF-nB pathways leading to reduced DNA-binding
ability of AP-1 and NF-nB transcription factors in WT cells (19, 20).
Thus, we examined the activation status of these pathways in the
clones. Whole-cell extracts of WT cells and the clones (Frituximab)
were subjected to immunoblotting for components of NF-nB and
ERK1/2 pathways. The phosphorylation-dependent state of IKK,
InB-a, and ERK1/2 was higher in the clones (f3.2- to 4.8-fold) than
in WT cells. Basal levels of these signaling molecules remained
unaffected in WT and RR clones (F rituximab, data not shown).
Rituximab significantly reduces the phosphorylation of these
molecules in WT cells (19, 20), an effect that is not observed in
clones (Fig. 3A), suggesting that molecular switches responsible for
rituximab-mediated dephosphorylation of these molecules are no
longer operative in clones.
To ascertain the observed hyperphosphorylation results in
increased activity of NF-nB and ERK1/2 pathways, immunocomplex kinase assays were done to assess IKK and MEK1/2 kinase
activities of the clones (Frituximab) using InB-a peptide (IKK
substrate) and MAPK kinase substrate-4 (ERK1/2 substrate).
Untreated clones showed significantly increased kinase activities
as shown by increased ability of the lysates to phosphorylate their
specific substrates, whereby rituximab did not reduce the IKK and
MEK1/2 kinase activities. This phenomenon was not observed by
InB-a peptide S32/36A (data not shown). In contrast, in WT cells,
rituximab diminishes the kinase activity of IKK and MEK1/2
(Fig. 3B); thus, increased phosphorylation of signaling molecules
culminates in higher kinase activity of these pathways in the
clones. Next, alterations in the DNA-binding ability of NF-nB and
AP-1 in the clones were examined. Biotin-labeled oligonucleotides
probes comprising the NF-nB (32) and AP-1 (31) consensus binding
sites were used in EMSAs, which reveal that, compared with WT
cells, NF-nB and AP-1 DNA-binding abilities are increased in the

Rituximab-induced decrease in NF-nB and AP-1 DNA-binding
ability was only observed in WT cells. The specificity of EMSA was
corroborated using appropriate controls (Fig. 3C). Specific
inhibitors (DHMEQ and PD098059) preferentially reduced NF-nB
and AP-1 DNA-binding abilities. Collectively, these results show
that NF-nB and ERK1/2 pathways are constitutively hyperactivated
in RR clones and denote the inability of rituximab to negatively
regulate the activities of these pathways in the clones unlike WT
cells. Hyperactivation of these pathways will lead to enhanced
transcription of their respective antiapoptotic target genes, leading
to higher drug resistance of the clones.

Chemosensitization of RR Clones by Pharmacologic
Inhibitors of ERK1/2 and NF-KB Pathways
The NF-nB and ERK1/2 pathways are hyperactivated in RR
clones, leading to overexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, all of
which are unaffected by rituximab. This prompted us to investigate
whether inhibition of these pathways or Bcl-2 members can reverse
chemoresistance. Because these pathways have higher activities in
RR clones, higher concentrations of inhibitors were required for
chemosensitization of the clones than those used for WT cells, the
nontoxic effective concentrations of which were determined by
pilot studies (data not shown). Cells were either left untreated or
pretreated with DHMEQ (36), bortezomib (37), and PD098059 (33).
Escalating concentrations of various drugs were then added, and
the percentage of apoptosis was measured. In Ramos-RR1, whereas
DHMEQ induces 10.1 F 2.1% apoptosis, it significantly augments
the apoptotic effects of drugs (paclitaxel, 20.4 F 3.0% ! 46.5 F
2.3%; Adriamycin, 14.3 F 3.3% ! 32.4 F 2.9%; VP-16, 10.3 F 1.1%
! 53.0 F 2.6%; cisplatin, 19.0 F 0.7% ! 61.2 F 2.1%; vincristine,
15.3 F 1.1% ! 53.5 F 2.2%). In Daudi-RR1, DHMEQ induces 4.9 F
1.6% apoptosis and augments drug efficacy (paclitaxel, 14.9 F 3.2%

! 42.0 F 1.9%; Adriamycin, 12.4 F 2.5% ! 40.5 F 3.1%; VP-16,
11.8 F 0.9% ! 32.0 F 2.2%; cisplatin, 25.7 F 3.1% ! 36.6 F 0.9%;
vincristine, 14.2 F 1.7% ! 36.6 F 2.3%; Fig. 4A–C). Similar patterns
of significant dose-dependent chemosensitization of RR clones
were observed; however, for simplicity, only the values pertaining to
the highest drug concentration are presented (Table 1A). Enhanced
cytotoxicity by DHMEQ was 2.3- to 5.1-fold and 1.4- to 3.3-fold, by
bortezomib was 1.8- to 5.1-fold and 1.7- to 3.3-fold, and by
PD098059 was 1.8- to 3.1-fold and 1.5- to 2.7-fold in Ramos-RR1 and
Daudi-RR1, respectively (Table 1B). The ability of inhibitors to
significantly chemosensitize the RR clones (1.5- to 5.1-fold)
suggests that inhibition of NF-nB and ERK1/2 pathways can avert
chemoresistance and rituximab resistance in clones to subtoxic
drug concentrations.
Because inhibitors efficiently chemosensitized the clones, we
assessed their effect on expression of the resistant factors. As
depicted by qPCR inhibitors, mRNA levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Mcl-1 were reduced by 1.2- to 4.8-fold and 1.2- to 6.6-fold (Fig. 5A),
and immunoblots showed 1.25- to 3.3-fold and 1.1- to 3.3-fold
decreases in their protein levels in Ramos-RR1 and Daudi-RR1,
respectively (Fig. 5B), further suggesting the involvement of NF-nB
and ERK1/2 pathways in the expression of resistant factors.
The chemoprotective role of the overexpressed Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Mcl-1 in clones was further confirmed by pretreatment with
2MAM-A3 (38), which chemosensitized the clones at levels
comparable with those achieved by rituximab. In WT Ramos,
2MAM-A3 augmented paclitaxel cytotoxicity by 1.96-fold (13.6 F
1.3% ! 26.7 F 2.2%), which was 4.71-fold (8.42 F 2.1% ! 39.7 F
2.4%) in Ramos-RR1. A similar pattern was observed in Daudi
(WT, 1.98-fold; RR1, 3.2-fold; Fig. 5C). These findings support our
contention that overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members
upon prolonged rituximab treatment protects the cells against

drug-induced apoptosis and that their functional impairment is
critical for chemosensitization.

Discussion
This is the first report on the establishment of B-NHL RR clones,
which exhibit a different phenotypic profile compared with WT
cells. Using various biochemical and functional assays, compared
with WT cells, RR clones express lower levels of surface CD20 and
do not respond to growth inhibition by rituximab, rituximabmediated CDC, or cross-linked rituximab-induced apoptosis.
Further, RR clones are not chemosensitized by rituximab and
exhibit higher drug resistance (1.41- to 2.97-fold). Two major
survival pathways (NF-nB and ERK1/2) are constitutively hyperactivated in the clones, leading to overexpression of resistant
factors (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1; f2.3- to 5.0-fold). Pharmacologic
inhibition of Bcl-2 family members (by 2MAM-A3), NF-nB (by
DHMEQ, bortezomib), and ERK1/2 pathways (by PD098059) averts
the drug-resistant phenotype, and the clones undergo apoptosis in
response to low concentrations of various drugs (Fig. 6).
Reducing the proliferation rate of tumor cells is postulated as
one of the potential modes of action of rituximab (16, 17).

www.aacrjournals.org

Rituximab treatment of WT cells reduces their growth rate (28);
however, the clones grew at similar rates as WT cells and rituximab
(even at 2.5- to 5.0-fold higher concentrations) was incapable of
inhibiting their growth (Fig. 1B) consistent with the higher growth
rate and progressive nature of relapsed lymphomas, suggesting that
RR clones have lost the ability to undergo rituximab-mediated
growth reduction possibly through a defective ceramide acid
sphingomyelinase (A-SMase) pathway (39). Compared with WT
cells, RR clones exhibit higher resistance to CDC. Rituximab
pretreatment significantly enhanced CDC in WT cells—an effect
that was not noticed in the clones. Increasing serum concentrations enhanced rituximab-mediated CDC in WT cells but not in
clones (Fig. 1D), consistent with our preliminary findings that show
increased expression of complement inhibitors on the clones (data
not shown). Further studies are warranted to delineate the role
of complement inhibitors in CDC resistance of the RR clones.
Cross-linked rituximab induced significant apoptosis (Fig. 1E) and
cytostasis (data not shown) on WT cells. Neither induction of
apoptosis nor growth inhibition was observed on treatment of the
clones with cross-linked rituximab, suggesting that RR clones have
developed higher threshold in response to biological effects of
cross-linked rituximab. The above effects were independent of

rituximab concentration as higher (2.5- to 5-fold) concentrations
of rituximab failed to reverse the phenotype of the clones (Fig. 1).
Rituximab binds to B-cell–restricted cell surface CD20, thus
exerting its effects. Various mechanisms are postulated for
rituximab resistance including transient CD20 down-regulation
(40), loss of CD20 (41), and circulating CD20 (42). Substantial CD20
surface expression was detected on WT cells; still, RR clones
exhibited f50% reduction in surface CD20 expression (Fig. 1A).
The significance of reduced CD20 expression in clones requires
further investigation as several lines of evidence suggest that the
biological effects of rituximab therapy is autonomous of the
intensity of surface CD20 even in vivo (40). Thus, failure of
rituximab to exert its biological effects on RR clones may be independent of diminished CD20. It may be due to the activation status
of the clones and/or aberrant cellular signaling as deregulation of
the signaling pathways or aberrant expression of signaling
molecules contribute to acquired chemoresistance (42, 43). Analysis
of the signaling pathways in the clones revealed hyperactivation of
ERK1/2 and NF-nB pathways leading to overexpression of their
downstream resistant factors Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, and the
exhibition of higher drug resistance (1.41- to 2.97-fold) concordant
with the protective role of Bcl-2 family members (44–46), suggesting
that the selective pressure applied by prolonged rituximab
treatment has coselected for cells that express higher levels of
antiapoptotic proteins which have lost the capacity to undergo
apoptosis in response to various stimuli. The possibility of the
preexistence of resistant cells in the native culture is not ruled out.
Clearly, rituximab has not altered the biological properties of 100%

of the cells. However, the resistant subclones in native culture will
dominate the sensitive population on long-term rituximab treatment as the sensitive cells will be eliminated over time. However,
there is no unequivocal evidence, as yet, that this is the dominant
mechanism in vivo. Because drugs use apoptosis as a means of
exerting their effects, drug-resistant tumors develop cross-resistance
to apoptosis induced by structurally and functionally distinct
stimuli, including immunotherapy and vice versa. Thus, as NHL
cells develop resistance to rituximab, they may also develop crossresistance to drugs and the immune system, consistent with our
observation that drug-resistant RR clones also exhibit higher resistance to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and antiFas agonistic antibody (47). Rituximab pretreatment of WT cells, not
the clones, efficiently sensitized them to drugs and TRAIL (47).
Unlike WT cells (19, 20), rituximab was incapable of inhibiting
hyperactivated NF-nB and ERK1/2 pathways in the clones. Thus,
it is logical to speculate that constitutive hyperactivation of these
pathways confer higher drug resistance (21, 22); hence, their inhibition could potentially avert the chemoresistance, prompting us to
evaluate the chemosensitizing effects of specific inhibitors of NF-nB
and ERK1/2 pathways as well as bortezomib (Velcade; ref. 37).
DHMEQ is a unique inhibitor of NF-nB acting at the level of nuclear
translocation, completely inhibits NF-nB DNA-binding ability,
inhibits the growth of human hormone-refractory prostate and
bladder cancer cells, and induces apoptosis at high concentrations
(36, 48). PD098059 exerts its effects by specifically binding to
inactive form of MEK1/2 and prevents its activation by Raf-1, thus
inhibiting ERK1/2 activation (33). Bortezomib is approved for the

treatment of multiple myeloma and has significant single-agent activity against certain subtypes of NHL (49). These inhibitors efficiently
sensitized the RR clones to structurally and functionally distinct
drugs, including topoisomerase II inhibitor, DNA alkylating agents,
and microtubule poisons, albeit to varying degrees (Table 1). The
inhibitors also reduced Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 levels, further
suggesting that deregulated signaling culminates in overexpression
of antiapoptotic proteins in RR clones, which then leads to higher
drug resistance. The chemoprotective role of Bcl-2 family members
was confirmed by using 2MAM-A3, a specific inhibitor that binds to
the hydrophobic groove formed by the highly conserved BH1, BH2,
and BH3 domains, thus impairing the function of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Mcl-1 (38). 2MAM-A3 efficiently chemosensitized the clones, further
attesting that higher expression of resistant factors protects RR
clones from drug-induced apoptosis. Hence, aberrations in the
normal dynamics of cellular survival pathways upon continuous
rituximab exposure contribute to acquired rituximab and/or drug
resistance, whereas interruption of these pathways leads to chemosensitization of RR clones. Thus, functional impairment of
antiapoptotic proteins is critical for reversion of chemoresistance.
The nature of the molecular cues that trigger the aberrant
activation of survival pathways in the clones, hence their altered
phenotype, are unclear at present. In WT Daudi, rituximab induces

www.aacrjournals.org

a rapid and transient increase in A-SMase activity parallel with
cellular ceramide generation in lipid rafts. These cells externalize
both ceramide and A-SMase, which colocalize with CD20. Also,
rituximab-induced growth inhibition may be mediated through a
ceramide-dependent pathway (39). Preliminary observations suggest that rituximab-induced A-SMase translocation and ceramide
generation at cell surface are reduced in clones (50). Because
microdomains serve as signaling platforms, these data suggest that
rituximab resistance in clones is partly due to faulty mobilization of
the signaling molecules to lipid rafts and a crippled ceramide/
A-SMase pathway. These possibilities are currently under scrutiny.
The present findings are the first report on the establishment of
an in vitro model of RR NHL clones, which shows that repeated
rituximab exposure results in loss of the ability of rituximab to
regulate molecular switches leading to constitutive hyperactivation
of survival pathways, overexpression of resistant factors, and
increased apoptosis threshold. Accordingly, rituximab fails to exert
antilymphoma effects and RR clones develop higher drug
resistance, which may explain the treatment-refractory and the
aggressive nature of clinical rituximab-resistant and drug-resistant
NHL. Figure 6 shows the potential mechanisms of RR. The
observed drug resistance and rituximab resistance of RR clones
mimic those previously observed (27). However, RR clones are still

Figure 6. Proposed model of the development of RR in NHL B-cells. Among other mechanisms (18), alteration in the dynamics of cell signaling, via an elusive
mechanism, is a potential mechanism for the development of resistance to rituximab therapy. Continuous long-term rituximab exposure results in the development of
NHL B-cell clones that exhibit diminished CD20 surface expression. Compared with the parental cells, the clones exhibit significantly lower sensitivity to CDC-mediated
killing; apoptosis induced by cross-linked rituximab; and higher levels of p-InB-a, p-IKK, and p-ERK1/2 correlating with higher IKK and ERK1/2 kinase activities,
leading to higher DNA-binding ability of AP-1 and NF-nB, and culminating in increased Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL expression. Hyperactivation of these pathways will
increase the proliferation rate of the clones; increase the levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and the apoptosis threshold; and cause higher chemoresistance of the NHL B-cell
clones. Specific pharmacologic inhibition of NF-nB and ERK1/2 pathways, or functional impairment of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, averts the acquired
chemoresistance phenotype of the RR clones, inducing the cells to undergo apoptosis in response to low levels of drugs.

amenable to chemotherapy using specific molecular targeting of
the components of deregulated pathways. Our studies identify
several such targets for potential molecular intervention in the
treatment of rituximab-resistant and drug-resistant NHL. Analysis
of dynamics of survival pathways in patient-derived specimens may
also serve as biomarkers in choosing treatment options. Such
patients may be suitable candidates for alternative (e.g., targeted
therapy) over conventional regimens. Studies are under way to
validate our in vitro findings with freshly derived RR specimens and
to establish RR mouse model.
