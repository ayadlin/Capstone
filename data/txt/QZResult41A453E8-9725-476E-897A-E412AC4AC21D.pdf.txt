ABSTRACT
The resistance of apoptosis in cancer cells is pivotal for their survival and is
typically ruled by mutations or dysregulation of core apoptotic cascade. Mantle
cell lymphoma (MCL) is a non-Hodgkin’s B-cell malignancy expressing higher antiapoptotic proteins providing survival advantage. B-PAC-1, a procaspase activating
compound, induces apoptosis by sequestering Zn bound to procaspase-3, but the
amino acids holding Zn in Caspase-3 is not known. Here we show that reintroduction
of WT caspase-3 or 7 in Caspase3–7 double knock-out (DKO) mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEF) promoted B-PAC-1 to induce apoptosis (27–43%), but not in DKO
MEFs or MEFs expressing respective Casp3–7 catalytic mutants (12–13%). Using
caspase-6 and -9 exosite analysis, we identified and mutated predicted Zn-ligands
in caspase-3 (H108A, C148S and E272A) and overexpressed into DKO MEFs. Mutants
carrying E272A abrogated Zn-reversal of apoptosis induced by B-PAC-1 via higher XIAP
and smac expressions but not in H108A or C148S mutants. Co-immunoprecipitation
analysis revealed stronger XIAP-caspase-3 interaction suggesting a novel mechanism
of impulsive apoptosis resistance by disrupting predicted Zn-ligands in caspase-3.
B-PAC-1 sponsored apoptosis in MCL cell lines (30–73%) via caspase-3 and PARP
cleavages accompanied by loss of Mcl-1 and IAPs including XIAP while Zn substantially
abrogated B-PAC-1-driven apoptosis (18–36%). In contrary, Zn is dispensable to
inhibit staurosporin, bendamustine, ABT199 or MK206-induced apoptosis. Consistent
to cell lines, B-PAC-1 stimulated cell death in primary B-lymphoma cells via caspase-3
cleavage with decline in both Mcl-1 and XIAP. This study underscores the first genetic
evidence that B-PAC-1 driven apoptosis is mediated via Zn chelation.

proliferation and survival [2–5]. All these signaling events
converge to resistance to apoptosis which in part caused by
over-expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members
including Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in majority of MCL cells.
Given the potential role(s) of pro-apoptotic compounds for
treating cancer, incessant efforts are in progress to develop
therapeutics that target specific proteins in the apoptotic
cascade. Activation of zymogen procaspase-3 (procasp3) to caspase-3 (Casp3) is the hallmark of cell-death
pathway and the key “executioner” caspase, catalyzing
the hydrolysis of a multitude of protein substrates within
the cell [6]. Caspases play a provocative role leading to

INTRODUCTION
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a fatal B-cell nonHodgkin’s malignancy with a tendency to disseminate
throughout the body, including lymphoid tissues, bone
marrow and peripheral blood there by offering a broad
spectrum of clinical, pathological, and biological
significance. Cyclin D1 over-expression owing to
reciprocal translocation event t(11;14)(q13;q32) [1],
accompanied by constitutively activated PI3K/AKT/
mTOR network, aberrant WNT, Hedgehog and NFκB pathways are the major forces that drive MCL cell

programmed cell death (PCD) and are classified as either
initiators or upstream (Casp2, 8 and 9) or executioners or
downstream (Casp3, 6 and 7). Executioner caspases are
controlled via zymogen activation, in which proteolytic
processing by an upstream protease results in the
generation of a cleaved, active protein [7]. These caspase
zymogens are inherently maintained in a full-length,
unprocessed, and inactive dimer before being processed
during the onset of PCD. Several targets of apoptotic
machinery include genotoxic agents, MDM2-p53 or
B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors and Bcl2 antagonists
[8–11] rely on upstream apoptotic cascades yet a few are
known to induce directly Casp3–7 bypassing defective
upstream apoptotic circuitry. Interestingly, majority of
cancer cells including MCL possess relatively higher
levels of pro-casp3 [12] and pro-casp7 [13] allowing a
rational approach to selectively induce PCD via direct
activation of caspases. Therefore targeting cancer cells
expressing higher level of pro-casp3 over normal cells
would be advantageous. This strategy of direct caspase
activation and exterminating upstream regulators of PCD
that otherwise help MCL cells to acquire a strong survival
advantage is becoming a powerful tool in recent years.
Procaspase-activating compound-1 (PAC-1) was
discovered as the first line of procasp3–7 activators along
with other PAC-1 derivatives [12, 14–16]. A fluorescent
derivative of PAC-1 was found to co-localize within the
apoptotic cells expressing Casp3–7 suggest that PAC-1
acts to chelate inhibitory Zn from procasp3–7 to induce
PCD [12, 14–16]. Second generation of PAC-1 derivatives
resulted in more potent analog such as B-PAC-1. We
describe here the genetic basis of Zn chelation and caspase
activation by B-PAC-1 that directly activate PCD in both
MCL cell lines and in primary lymphoma cells with a
promise for future therapeutic use.

Casp3 substrate PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase).
Interestingly, both Annexin V-PI FACS analysis and
protein analysis revealed that ATM deficient [19]
Granta-519 was relatively resistant to B-PAC-1-induced
PCD compared to ATM proficient Jeko-1 and Mino cells.
In contrast, regardless of p53 status, both p53 deficient
Jeko-1 and p53 proficient Mino cells [19] were equally
sensitive to B-PAC-1 as evidenced by the cleavage of
both executioner Casp3 (p17 and p12), Casp7 (p20) and
PARP (Figure 1D). Immunoblot assays suggested that
multiple anti-apoptotic proteins including IAPs (cIAP1, cIAP-2 and XIAP), Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 levels were
reduced following B-PAC-1 treatment. This observation
was further supported by direct immunofluorescence
analysis from Jeko-1 cells (Figure 1E) indicating B-PAC-1
induced Casp3 cleavage is accompanied by nuclear
pycnosis and membrane blebbing. Densitometry analysis
(Figure 1F) revealed a significant decline in both XIAP
and Mcl-1 protein levels following B-PAC-1 treatment.
Consistent with Annexin V-PI FACS data, co-incubation
of B-PAC-1 and Zn also restored XIAP and Mcl-1
proteins, inhibition of Casp3 and Casp7 cleavage and
their substrates including PARP and ATM (Figure 1D).
Amongst other caspases, B-PAC-1-induced cleavage of
initiator Casp9 was inhibited by Zn while Casp6 cleavage
was not detected (data not shown) (Figure 1G). The DNA
alkylating agent bendamustine, Bcl-2 antagonist ABT199
or pan-AKT inhibitor MK2206 are clinically used for
treatment of B-cell malignancies. These agents also
induced PCD; however co-incubation of these compounds
with Zn failed to rescue apoptosis. This study indicates
that Zn induced reversal of PCD is B-PAC-1-specific
(Figure 1H).

Casp3-7 DKO MEFs were resistant to B-PAC-1driven apoptosis

RESULTS

Further explication of the role of Casp3 and Casp7
during B-PAC-1-induced apoptosis was evaluated in a
series of MEF cell lines. While B-PAC-1 (10 μM for 24 hr)
sensitized WT MEF (Casp3-7+/+) to PCD, Zn (100nM for
24 hr), mostly inhibited B-PAC-1 action. In contrast, MEF
cells lacking a single allele for both Casp3 and -7 (Casp37+/-) were less sensitive to B-PAC-1-driven apoptosis
compared with WT MEF. As expected B-PAC-1 failed
to sensitize DKO MEF cells to induce PCD, suggesting
dependence of Casp3 and -7 for final execution of PCD by
B-PAC-1 (Figure 2A and 2B).
Stable reintroduction of WT Casp3 into DKO MEF
cells significantly sensitized B-PAC-1 induced PCD,
while Casp3 catalytic mutant (Casp3C163A) blunted the
effect of B-PAC-1 suggesting that Casp3 with an active
site cysteine in the nucleophilic attack site is required for
targeting B-PAC-1 to induce PCD. Although less sensitive,
B-PAC-1 still induced PCD in DKO MEF cells stably
transfected with WT Casp7 but not in Casp7 catalytic
mutant (Casp7C186A) reconfirming that both Casp3

MCL cell lines treated with B-PAC-1 for 24 hr in a
dose-dependent manner and their respective IC50 values
were determined as ~9.0, ~5.0 or ~7.0 μM for Granta-519,
Jeko-1 and Mino cells, respectively (Figure 1A). Based
on this IC50 value, we selected 10 μM for all additional
experiments unless specied otherwise. Co-incubation of
B-PAC-1 with Zn rescued cell death in these cells entailing
that Zn plays a role in B-PAC-1-induced PCD (Figure 1B).
Treatment with either Zn or Pac-1a (an inactive derivative
of B-PAC-1~10 μM) failed to accomplish detectable PCD
compared to DMSO control (Figure 1C). In contrast,
staurosporin-induced apoptosis was not reverted by Zn
(Figure 1C).

cysteine proteases, it was hypothesized that the other
two zinc atoms may modulate catalytic activity, as
reported for Casp6 and Casp9 [22]. The locations of
the two non-catalytic zinc binding sites in Casp3 are
currently unknown. Velaquez-Delgado and Hardy [23]
recently reported that Casp6 binds two Zn atoms and
using X-ray crystallography studies determined the
binding site of the second metal ion, the Casp6 exosite.
Occupation of this site by Zn has an inhibitory effect
on the catalytic activity. Casp9 binds two Zn ions and
site directed mutagenesis, determined the location of the
second ion, the Casp9 exosite [22]. Using sequence and
structural alignment, Velaquez-Delgado and Hardy [23]
reported that in Casp3, the Casp6 exosite, (thereafter
referred to as exosite-6), is comprised of Ser36, Glu272,
and Tyr274 (Figure 3B). As in Casp6, with respect to the
location of the catalytic site, these amino acids reside at
the distal end of an α-helix, as shown in Casp3 crystal
structure (PDBID 1PAU) [24–26]. This exosite does not

contain the canonical zinc binding residues cysteine and
histidine, but serine, glutamic acid, and tyrosine, and
nearby Glu231 could potentially form a unique chelation
site. Further, these residues could participate in intraand inter-subunit interactions that could impact activity
(Figure 3C). In Casp3, the Casp9 exosite, (exosite-9),
is composed of His108, Ser113, Phe114, and Cys148.
Of these, the X-ray structures of Casp3 show that the
histidine and cysteine residues are positioned to chelate
zinc and this site is also located distal from the catalytic
site (Figure 3D). This site is highly conserved in all
caspases [23]. To determine if either of these potential
exosites has a bearing on B-PAC-1-driven activity of
Casp3, mutations of key residues were introduced. In
exosite-6, Glu272 was mutated to alanine. In exosite-9,

His108 and Cys148 were mutated to alanine and serine
respectively.
A series of Flag-tagged Casp3 constructs harboring
mutations were generated into the human Casp3 ORF
and sequence verified as shown in Figure 4A. All these
constructs were sub-cloned into a C terminal 3XFlagepitope tagged vector and were stably transected into
DKO MEF cells. Both B-PAC-1 and Zn IC50 values were
titrated using WT Casp3 transfected DKO MEF cells
(Supplemental information S1 and S2) and used for the
entire experiment. While DKO MEF cells carrying vector
alone failed to induce PCD, (Figure 4B), WT Casp3
transfected cells were sensitized by B-PAC-1 induced PCD
and Zn significantly reverted apoptosis. Interestingly, cells
carrying Casp3 mutants encountered a relative resistance

to B-PAC-1-induced PCD compared with WT Casp3.
B-PAC-1 induced PCD was significantly reversed by Zn in
both H108A and C148S single mutants but failed to rescue
in E272A single mutant or in double and triple mutants
harboring E272A when compared with WT Casp3 (Figure
4C). Western blot analysis revealed B-PAC-1 driven PCD
was accompanied by loss of full length PARP and XIAP
and Casp3 cleavage (p17) in WT and Zn-Casp3 mutants
(Figure 4D). Surprisingly, majority of Zn-Casp3 mutants
expressed a relatively higher basal XIAP in presence of
B-PAC-1 or B-PAC-1+Zn when normalized with cleaved
Casp3 (p17) (Figure 4E). Neither basal pro-casp3 nor
B-PAC-1 induced cleaved Casp3 (p17) fragment were
altered in these clones. This data advocates a possible
mechanism of resistance to spontaneous cleavage of
apoptotic protease in these mutants via up-regulation of
XIAP protein.

Having observed a relatively higher basal XIAP
expression in majority of Zn-Casp3 mutants, we
next tested Casp3-XIAP physical interaction in the
mutant clones. Based on exosite cluster analysis, we
hypothesized that by dismantling Zn ligands in Casp3
would spontaneously induce PCD. However, we could
not detect any spontaneous PCD in these mutant clones.
Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a relatively higher
Casp3-XIAP physical interaction in MEF cells carrying

harboring mutants) and HA-XIAP constructs demonstrated
that an increased Casp3-XIAP physical interaction in
majority of E272A harboring mutants compared with
WT Casp3 transfected cells (Figure 5B). These data
substantiate that mutation in predicted Zn-Casp3 amino
acids reciprocally inhibit spontaneous PCD via acquiring
an increased affinity of XIAP-Casp3 physical interaction.
Owing to stronger Casp3-XIAP complex in these
mutants, we next hypothesized that perhaps more Smac
mimetic is required in order to dismantle Casp3-XIAP
interaction in order to induce PCD. MEF cells carrying
WT Casp3 were titrated to determine IC50 value of 066
(Supplemental information S3). MEF cells carrying
WT or Zn-Casp3 mutants were identically treated with
066 and their viability was determined by AnnexinV-PI

revealed 066-induced PCD was more pronounced in WT

Casp3 carrying MEF cells accompanied by cleavage of
PARP, loss of XIAP and smac levels and Casp3 (p17)
cleavage compared to Zn-Casp3 mutants (Figure 5C
and SI Information S5) while majority of these mutants
retained relatively higher smac expression in identical
condition. AnnexinV-PI FACS analysis reconfirmed that
066 significantly induced PCD (p < 0.0001–0.0002) in
both WT and H108A mutant, while C148S and mutants
carrying E272A were resistant to 066. This data prompted
us to study real time RT-PCR analysis of Casp3 and XIAP
mRNA levels in these clones. A relatively higher Casp3
mRNA expression was observed in H108A, C148S and in
C148S+E272A double mutant compared with WT (Figure

expressions remained unchanged in majority of clones
except in H108A and C148S+E272A double mutants.
However, the ratio of XIAP/Casp3 remained higher in

these mutant clones compared with MEFs carrying WT
Casp3. This observation supports protein expressions
in transient transfection assay with either higher XIAP
or lower Casp3 expressions leading to an increased
affinity of XIAP-Casp3 physical interaction (Figure 5B).
Although none of these mRNA expression data were
significant, we predicted a possible stability of XIAP
protein in these clones. Cycloheximide treatment in these
clones followed by protein and densitometry analysis
revealed a relatively higher XIAP stability in the double
mutants harboring E272A compared with WT Casp3
(Figure 5F). Collectively, these studies demand a possible
novel mechanism of resistance in these clones averting
spontaneous PCD following mutation in the predicted
Zn ligands in Casp3 via higher XIAP-Casp3 physical
interaction, higher XIAP and smac expressions and XIAP
stability.

a median overall survival time of only 3–5 years [28–30].
While immunotherapy with rituximab in combination with
high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell
transplantation is a routine choice [31] yet, majority of
patients experience poor outcome. High degree of genomic
instability [32], distinct chromosomal alterations including
losses, gains, and amplifications of chromosomal regions
harboring gene(s) involved in cell-cycle regulation, DNA
damage response pathways, signal transduction, and
apoptosis are the major driving forces of MCL [1].
One of the stumbling blocks of treating MCL is
accompanied by the deregulation of Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and
BIM or inactivation of Apaf-1, thereby allowing these
cells to evade caspase-mediated apoptosis [33, 34]. Higher
expression of Bcl-2 family antiapoptotic proteins assisted
by cyclin D1 mis-expression, faulty ubiquitin-proteasome
system and defects in apoptosis upstream of caspase
activation, renders MCL more difficult to treat [35].
Therefore, exploiting small-molecule that can directly
activate pro-casp3 obliterating upstream regulators would
be a more rational approach for targeting MCL [36, 37].
Earlier observation on pet dog bearing lymphoma
[15] documented that S-PAC-1 activated procaspase-3 and
elicit tumor cell death (an earlier derivative of B-PAC-1).
In this study authors performed a small efficacy trial with
S-PAC-1, which included six pet dogs bearing lymphoma
and showed that S-PAC-1 was well tolerated and that the
treatments induced partial tumor regression in four of six
subjects. Furthermore a recent study documented with a
detailed antitumor activity of PAC-1 (an earlier derivative
of B-PAC-1) in murine xenograft model [38] carrying EL4
lymphoma cells transplanted in C57BL/6 mice and were
treated with PAC-1 (125 mg/kg), 1541B (17.5 mg/kg), or
with a combination of PAC-1 and 1541B (125 mg/kg and
17.5 mg/kg, respectively) once-a-day for three days. While
PAC-1 had a small but statistically significant effect on
tumor growth in this model, the combination of PAC-1
and 1541B dramatically retarded tumor growth in vivo
without any systemic toxic side effects.
PAC-1 was synthesized to activate Casp3 by
chelating inhibitory zinc ions from the zymogen proCasp3 initiating tumor cell death both in vitro and in vivo

B-PAC-1 induces apoptosis in primary B-cell
lymphoma cells
Primary lymphoma cells from 19 patients including
MCL (n = 7), MZL (n = 5), DLBCL (n = 4) and FL (n =
3) were tested (Table 1). B-PAC-1-induced PCD was a
common feature in all these samples regardless of their
subtype while co-incubation with Zn resulted in significant
inhibition of PCD (Figure 6A and 6B). Amongst different
lymphomas (Figure 6B) MCL and DLBCL subtypes were
more sensitive than MZL and FL samples. Western blot
analysis showed B-PAC-1-induced cleavage of Casp3 and
PARP together amid loss of XIAP (Figure 6C). In several
primary cells, ATM protein expression was undetectable;
a common feature in MCL [27]. Collectively, B-PAC-1
stimulates PCD in primary lymphomas regardless of ATM
status (Figure 6D) and this was partially reverted by Zn
addition.

DISCUSSION
The treatment of MCL is an enormous challenge
and is characterized by an aggressive clinical course and
inevitable development of relapsed/refractory disease with

[14] and currently in Phase I clinical trial. B-PAC-1
was created [15] as an analogue of the first generation
compound PAC-1. In this work, we test the efficacy of
B-PAC-1 in MCL and present evidence showing B-PAC-1
has the ability to directly activate pro-casp3 to induce PCD
in MCL cell lines via Zn sequestration and incubation of
B-PAC-1 and Zn together significantly disrupt apoptotic
program. We further show evidence that B-PAC-1 induces
PCD in multiple primary lymphomas regardless of their
cytogenetic status or their subtypes. Despite a variable
magnitude of cell death offered by B-PAC-1 in the patient
samples, consistent to our cell line studies we show that
reversal of apoptosis via Zn chelation is widespread
in primary lymphoma cells. However, normal T and B
lymphocytes were less sensitive to B-PAC-1 mediated
PCD providing a therapeutic index [39].
Despite a strong metal binding affinity exists
in B-PAC-1 (containing the ortho-hydroxy N-acyl
hydrozone motif), however, the Zn chelation is not
widespread with other apoptosis-inducing drugs (Figure
1H). B-PAC-1 mediated Zn chelation was specific to
executioner pro-caspases since B-PAC-1 does not alter
the Zn-binding enzymes such as carboxypeptidase A or
histone deacetylase [39]. Similarly, B-PAC-1 treatment
did not influence inflammatory caspases like Casp1 [39]
suggesting selectivity of B-PAC-1 for apoptotic terminal
caspases.
Following a death stimuli, both intrinsic and the
extrinsic apoptotic pathways converge and activate
the “executioner” procaspases (pro-casp3, 7 and 6)
through a cascade of events [40] leading to proteolysis
of > 400 cellular proteins. We therefore assessed the
role of B-PAC-1 on executioner caspases mostly in their
respective nucleophilic sites. While initiator caspase-8 and
-9 normally exist as inactive monomers that are activated
by dimerization and not by cleavage [6] the effecter
Casp3, 6 and 7 exist as dimers and are cleaved by initiator
caspases leading to a conformational change that brings
the two active sites together and creates a functional
mature protease [41]. These procedural differences in
the activation of initiator versus executioner caspases
may result in selective action of B-PAC-1 on executioner
caspases via Zn sequestration. Normally, Casp3 is a
heterotetramer in its functional form and each heterodimer
is formed and stabilized by hydrophobic interactions
between the large (p17) and small (p12) subunits. The
active site of Casp3 utilizes a cysteine-histidine dyad, with
an aspartate in the P1 pocket. The active pocket of Casp3
is the nucleophilic cysteine163 and histidine121 [42].
Using DKO MEFs stably overexpressing Casp3-C163A
or Casp7-C186A we show that B-PAC-1 failed to induce
PCD reconfirming B-PAC-1 driven apoptosis requires
catalytic cysteine moieties of both Casp3 and -7 regardless
of Zn chelation for a full grown PCD.
Recently we documented B-PAC1 efficacy to
induce apoptosis in both CLL and multiple myeloma cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[39, 43], however the mechanism of Zn chelation is not
known. We therefore interrogated where Zn is bound to
procaspase3 and how next generation PAC-1 compounds
could be made more specific to caspase activation via
Zn chelation. Historically, the role of Zn on apoptosis
emerged from the pioneering study showing drastic PCD
in the small intestinal crypts of zinc-deficient rats [44] or in
leukemic cell lines [45] likely due to lack of zinc-mediated
caspase inhibition. Essentially, glucocorticoid-induced
PCD in mouse thymocytes was inhibited by Zn ions [46].
Although high zinc concentrations (>500 μM) induce PCD
but at physiological level zinc is known as suppressor of
apoptosis [47]. The inhibition of caspases by Zn and other
transition metals, including copper, was reported soon
after the discovery of caspases [21]. Zn preferentially
binds to Cys (5.8%), His (2.4%), Asp (0.28%), and Glu
(0.13%) (CHDE), collectively account for ~98% of all
Zn-binding residues [48]. Although majority (>90%) of
cellular zinc is known to be sequestered in tightly-bound
complexes of metalloenzymes and zinc finger proteins,
however a small portion (<10%) of zinc exists in labile,
loosely-bound pools [49]. Amongst other executioner
caspases, Zn binds to Lys-36, Glu-244 and His-287 with
a water molecule serving as the fourth ligand in Casp6
[23]. Similarly, H237, C239, and C287 include the active
site dyad and are primarily responsible for zinc-mediated
inhibition in Casp9 [22].
While the active sites for Zn in Casp3 molecule is
unknown, we used the exosite cluster analysis of Casp9
[22] and mutated several predicted Zn-binding regions
in both active and exosites. Our biochemical analysis
shows that only E272 had an impact on apoptosis; while
both H108 and C148 are not relevant sites since Zn could
still significantly inhibit B-PAC-1-induced PCD in these
mutants. Interestingly none of these clones were found to
induce spontaneous apoptosis when over-expressed into
DKO-MEF cells. In contrast, we encountered a unique
mechanism of resistance to PCD from these mutant
clones owing to relatively higher expression of XIAP
and stronger Casp3-XIAP physical interaction rendering
resistance to spontaneous apoptosis in these clones.
E272 is involved in several intra- and inter-domain
interactions that may account for the observed effect
(Figure 3C). Crystal structures of active Casp3 proposed
multiple backbone-backbone interactions between the
β-strands of the small subunits from residues 264–267
(Green β-strands in Figure 3C). Further, there are interdomain hydrogen bonds between the side chains of both
E272 and E231 of one small subunit and H234 of the
opposing small subunit. Within each small subunit, the
side chain carboxyl group of E272 contacts the side chain
hydroxyl group of Y274, and both residues contact β and γ
methylene groups of E231, the initial amino acid in α-helix
231–247. Additionally, the non-polar side chain atoms of
E272 and Y274 in the small subunit contact the βCH2 of
S36 in the large subunit. The carboxyl group of E272 is
3472

Oncotarget

located within hydrogen bonding distance to H234 in the
opposing small subunit in the dimeric unit. This network
of interactions likely plays a role in stabilization of helix
231–247 and may be important for interaction with
N-terminal segment of the large subunit. Replacement
of E272 with alanine would remove the hydrogen bond
with Y274 which could destabilize this cluster and alter
the interactions between the large and small subunits
of heterodimer. Further, disruption of this cluster could
interrupt the interactions between the two small subunits
thereby destabilizing the tetrameric structure of the
enzyme complex which could alter the placement of the
loop bundle [26] leading to impaired catalytic activity or
altered substrate recognition. Further, the E272A mutation
could alter the dynamics of helix 231–247 which could
potentially impact catalytic activity in a manner analogous
to the removal of zinc from the exosite in Casp6.
IAPs are unique molecules with BIR (baculovirus
IAP repeat) domain and XIAP is the prototype member
of the family. The complex structure of the Bir2 domain
of XIAP and the catalytic domains of Casp3 indicates
that the interaction takes place at the catalytic site and
impact the loop bundle [25]. Given that the mutations in
the exosites were rather distal from the catalytic site and
from the sites of interaction of the Bir2 domain, it is not
clear why the mutants would exhibit apparent increased
affinity for XIAP. The mechanism by which these Casp3Zn mutants inhibit spontaneous apoptosis awaits further
studies although earlier predictions have suggested that
H237 and C285 are involved in catalysis [50], yet no
work has been reported using these targets and to our
knowledge this study is the first documentation of how
Casp3-Zn interaction is destabilized following mutation
in the predicted exosites of Casp6 and Casp9.
