Abstract
We hypothesized that IFN-A would enhance the apoptotic
activity of bortezomib on melanoma cells. Combined treatment with bortezomib and IFN-A induced synergistic apoptosis in melanoma and other solid tumor cell lines. Apoptosis
was associated with processing of procaspase-3, procaspase-7,
procaspase-8, and procaspase-9 and with cleavage of Bid
and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Bortezomib plus IFN-A
was effective at inducing apoptosis in melanoma cells that
overexpressed Bcl-2 or Mcl-1, suggesting that this treatment
combination can overcome mitochondrial pathways of cell
survival and resistance to apoptosis. The proapoptotic effects
of this treatment combination were abrogated by a caspase-8
inhibitor, led to increased association of Fas and FADD
before the onset of cell death, and were significantly reduced
in cells transfected with a dominant-negative FADD construct
or small interfering RNA targeting Fas. These data suggest that
bortezomib and IFN-A act through the extrinsic pathway of
apoptosis via FADD-induced caspase-8 activation to initiate
cell death. Finally, bortezomib and IFN-A displayed statistically significant antitumor activity compared with either
agent alone in both the B16 murine model of melanoma and
in athymic mice bearing human A375 xenografts. These data
support the future clinical development of bortezomib and
IFN-A for malignant melanoma. [Cancer Res 2008;68(20):8351–60]

Introduction
Bortezomib is a novel antitumor compound that specifically and
reversibly inhibits the 26S proteasome. The proteasome plays a
critical role in the ordered, temporal degradation of transcription
factors, cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors required for
cell cycle progression in malignant and normal cells (1).
Bortezomib has in vitro activity against a variety of tumor cell
types (2–5). As a single agent, bortezomib has an acceptable
toxicity profile and has shown activity in patients with advanced
multiple myeloma, non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and non–small cell lung cancer (6–9). Bortezomib has also
shown some clinical activity in other solid tumors, including

advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC; refs. 10, 11). Single-agent
bortezomib was tested in a phase II study of malignant melanoma;
however, no responses were achieved when the drug was
administered at 1.5 mg/m2 i.v. twice weekly for 2 weeks out of
every 3 (12). Based on these studies, current research efforts in
solid tumors are now focused on the use of bortezomib in
combination with other proapoptotic agents (13–16).
Recombinant IFN-a has been used in the treatment of malignant
melanoma and RCC and mediates the regression of metastatic
disease in about 10% to 15% of patients (17, 18). Studies
investigating the proapoptotic effects of IFN-a in tumor cell lines
indicate that this cytokine can activate both the intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways of apoptosis (19–24). Of note, IFN-a has been
shown to increase the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins
(e.g., p21) in malignant cells and proteins involved in the death
receptor cascade [Fas and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)], thereby sensitizing cells to
apoptotic stimuli (25, 26). These observations suggested that IFN-a
therapy might enhance the proapoptotic effects of proteasome
inhibition in the setting of melanoma.
In the present study, we have shown that treatment of melanoma cells with bortezomib and IFN-a synergistically induced
apoptotic cell death via FADD-dependent activation of caspase-8.
Importantly, this treatment combination could effectively induce
apoptosis in cells that overexpressed Bcl-2 or Mcl-1, two relevant
pathways of cellular survival and resistance to apoptosis in
melanoma cells.

Interferon-a and Bortezomib Induce Apoptosis
Institute, Boston, MA). The pCR3.1-Mcl-1 vector was a gift from Dr. H.
Rabinowich (University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA). The
dominant-negative FADD (FADD-DN) vector that expresses a truncated
form of the FADD protein was provided by Dr. A. Taghiev (University of
Iowa, Iowa City, IO; ref. 27). Fas-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and
negative control siRNA constructs were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.
Analysis of apoptosis via Annexin V/propidium iodide staining.
Phosphatidylserine exposure was assessed in tumor cells by flow cytometry
using APC-Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI; BD PharMingen) as
previously described (28). Each analysis was performed using at least 10,000
events.
Immunoblot analysis. Immunoblots were prepared as previously
described and probed with antibodies specific for FADD, Fas, FasL, Bax
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), human Bid (a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2
family), Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, cleaved
caspase-7, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Cell Signaling Technology),
caspase-9 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), Noxa (Calbiochem), or h-actin
(Sigma; ref. 29). Following incubation with the appropriate horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody, immune complexes were
detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence Plus detection kit
(Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by quantitative densitometry using
Optimas 6.51 image analysis software (Media Cybernetics).
Proliferation assays. The effects of bortezomib and IFN-a on cell
proliferation were tested in murine melanoma cell lines (B16F1 and JB/MS),
human melanoma cell lines (HT144 and MEL 39), and human RCC cell
lines (RC-45 and RC-54). Cell proliferation was measured as absorbance
at 570 nm using the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium
Bromide (MTT) Cell Proliferation Assay kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (ATCC). All assays were performed in triplicate as previously
described (19).
Murine tumor models and treatments. An i.p. tumor model of
malignant melanoma was used to determine whether treatment with the
combination of bortezomib and IFN-a was superior in antitumor activity
to either agent alone (19). Immune-competent female C57BL/6 mice
(n = 11 mice per group; 6–8 wk of age; Taconic Farms, Inc.) were injected
i.p. on day 0 with 106 B16F1 murine melanoma cells. Beginning the next
day, mice received PBS, bortezomib (1.0 mg/kg twice weekly, i.p.), murine
IFN-a (2  104 units/d, i.p.), or IFN-a and bortezomib combined and
monitored for survival. Human xenograft studies were conducted similar to
other published reports investigating in vivo activity of bortezomib in
athymic mice (5, 16). Briefly, female BALB/cnu/nu (athymic) mice (Taconic
Farms, Inc.) were injected s.c. in the right flank with 2  106 human A375
melanoma cells (day 0). Once tumors were palpable, mice were
randomized to one of four treatment groups: (a) PBS, (b) IFN-a2b (2 
104 units/d, i.p.), (c) bortezomib (1.0 mg/kg twice weekly, s.c. peritumoral),
and (d) IFN-a and bortezomib combined. Bidimensional tumor measurements were obtained twice weekly using microcalipers. The weight of all
animals receiving bortezomib or IFN-a and bortezomib combined was
monitored for dosing and to assess toxicity throughout the study.
Histologic analysis of apoptosis in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tumor xenografts was conducted using terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) as recommended
by the manufacturer (Chemicon, Inc.). CD31 immunostaining was also
used to evaluate angiogenesis in FFPE tumor xenografts. All samples were
analyzed in a blinded fashion by an experienced pathologist (A.R.C.), and
the number of cells positive for each marker of interest was quantitated
per 10 high-power fields.
Statistical analysis. ANOVA was used to determine if the two drugs
(bortezomib and IFN-a) reduced cell proliferation in a synergistic manner.
Regression diagnostics (i.e., residual plots and descriptive statistics) were
used to check model assumptions. Median-effect analysis was used to
analyze the interaction between bortezomib and IFN-a as described by
Chou and Talalay (30). The combination index (CI) evaluates dose
information for each drug alone and, in combination, at a specified effect
level to identify whether two drugs act to induce apoptosis in a synergistic
manner (CI < 1), an additive manner (CI = 1), or an antagonistic fashion

www.aacrjournals.org

(CI > 1). CalcuSyn software from Biosoft was used for this multiple drugeffect analysis. The analyses for synergistic apoptosis were conducted using
data obtained from Annexin V/PI assays (% apoptotic cells) and were
performed under the assumption that these drugs had independent
modes of action and were therefore mutually nonexclusive. Median survival
time in murine experiments was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method
and comparisons overall and between groups were made using the log-rank
test. The Holm procedure is a modified Bonferroni type procedure that
maintains the experiment-wise error rate and was used to make adjustments for multiple comparisons between dose groups. For human xenograft
studies, tumor volume data were log transformed before statistical analyses
to stabilize the variance of the measures and improve normality. Tumor
volume data between the four groups on day 25 were compared via ANOVA
with a Tukey-Kramer adjustment for multiple comparisons. A mixed-effects
model was used to analyze the repeated volume measurements while
adjusting for the correlation within mice. All analyses were performed in
Statistical Analysis System (version 9.1; SAS Institute). Adjusted P values
were considered significant at the 0.05 level and all tests were two sided.

Results
Treatment of melanoma and RCC cell lines with bortezomib
and IFN-A leads to enhanced apoptotic cell death. The ability
of both bortezomib and IFN-a to induce tumor cell apoptosis when
administered as single agents led us to examine the effects of
combined therapy (3, 20). Human and murine melanoma cells were
treated for 48 h with PBS, bortezomib, IFN-a, or both agents
combined. Bortezomib in combination with IFN-a led to significantly increased levels of apoptosis as measured by Annexin
V/PI staining compared with either agent alone in human
melanoma (HT144, A375, 1259 MEL, 18105 MEL, and MEL 39),
RCC (RC-45 and RC-54), colorectal carcinoma (COLO-205),
lymphoma (Kasumi-3), and multiple murine melanoma cell lines
(JB/MS and B16F1; Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1A; data not
shown; P < 0.05). An irreversible proteasome inhibitor (MG-132)
also induced synergistic apoptosis when combined with IFN-a
(data not shown). Time course experiments conducted in the
B16F1 cell line revealed that apoptosis began at f24 h and reached
maximal levels between 48 and 72 h (Supplementary Fig. S1B; data
not shown). The order of treatment did not seem to be critical as
cells treated with IFN-a separately followed by bortezomib
separately or, conversely, bortezomib followed by IFN-a displayed
comparable cell death (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Consistent with
our previous observations, cells treated simultaneously with both
agents displayed the greatest level of apoptosis. Bortezomib plus
IFN-a induced apoptosis in melanoma cell lines with both functional p53 (A375, 18105 MEL, and HT144) and in cell lines with a
p53-mutant phenotype (SK-MEL-2) and did not induce apoptosis
in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (data not shown).
Treatment of human (HT144 and MEL 39) and murine (B16F1 and
JB/MS) melanoma cell lines with bortezomib plus IFN-a also led to
a significant reduction in cell proliferation compared with either
agent alone (Fig. 1B; ANOVA interaction P < 0.001). Of note,
enhanced apoptosis of human melanoma cells was observed
following treatment with bortezomib and IFN-h but not in
response to bortezomib and IFN-g (Supplementary Fig. S2A–C).
Apoptosis induced by bortezomib and IFN-A is synergistic.
Using the median-effect method, we next assessed if bortezomib
and IFN-a induced synergistic apoptosis (31). HT144 melanoma
cells were treated for 48 h with various doses of bortezomib, IFN-a,
or both agents combined ( five dose combinations) and then
analyzed for apoptosis via Annexin V/PI staining. Dose-effect plots
indicated that increasing the dosage of IFN-a had little effect on

the induction of apoptosis, whereas bortezomib treatment resulted
in dose-dependent increases in apoptosis (Fig. 1C). At each paired
dose, the proapoptotic effect was further enhanced following
combined treatment with bortezomib plus IFN-a (Fig. 1C). Dose
combinations of 5 nmol/L bortezomib and 5  103 units/mL IFN-a
or greater resulted in CIs consistently below 1.0, suggesting a dosedependent, synergistic effect on apoptosis of HT144 melanoma
cells (Fig. 1C and D).
Combined treatment with bortezomib and IFN-A induces
processing of effector caspases and PARP. Enhanced processing of the major effector caspases (caspase-3 and caspase-7) to
their active forms and cleavage of PARP (a target of activated

effector caspases) was observed at 48 h following treatment of the
HT144 human melanoma cell line with bortezomib plus IFN-a
(Fig. 2A). This pattern of caspase activation and cleavage of PARP
was reproducible in multiple human melanoma cell lines (1259
MEL, A375, HT144, 18105 MEL, and MEL 39; Supplementary
Fig. S3; data not shown). Enhanced cleavage of caspase-3 in the
human HT144 and murine B16F1 melanoma cell line following
dual treatment was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B; data
not shown).
Bortezomib and IFN-A induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. We next sought to determine the dependence of cell death
on caspase activation. HT144 human melanoma cells were treated

Figure 2. Treatment with bortezomib and IFN-a results in cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP. A, the HT144 human melanoma cell line was treated
for 48 h with PBS, IFN-a (104 units/mL), bortezomib (5 or 10 nmol/L), or both agents combined and evaluated by immunoblot analysis for caspase-3, caspase-7,
cleaved caspase-7, and cleaved PARP (arrows ). Membranes were probed with an anti-h-actin antibody as a loading control. Similar results were obtained in
multiple human melanoma cell lines (A375, 18105 MEL, and 1259 MEL). B, levels of cleaved caspase-3 were measured by flow cytometry with a FITC-conjugated
rabbit anti-active caspase-3 monoclonal antibody (Asp175; Cell Signaling Technology) in the HT144 melanoma cell line 48 h following treatment. Shaded histograms
represent staining with cleaved caspase-3 antibody. Voltage was set based on appropriate isotype control antibodies (M1). The percentage of cells positive for
cleaved caspase-3 is given in each histogram. C, inhibition of caspase activation reverses the proapoptotic effects of bortezomib and IFN-a treatment. HT144 cells
were treated with PBS, IFN-a (104 units/mL), bortezomib (10 nmol/L), or both agents combined in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK or
a negative control compound (Z-FA-FMK) at a 50 Amol/L concentration for 48 h.

with PBS, IFN-a, bortezomib, or both agents combined in the presence of either the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (50 Amol/L)
or Z-FA-FMK (negative control). The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK significantly inhibited apoptotic cell death at the 48-h time
point in response to bortezomib plus IFN-a (mean % of Annexin
V–positive cells = 10.08 F 3.37%; n = 3 experiments; P = 0.04)
compared with similarly treated cells cultured in the presence of
the negative control compound (mean % of Annexin V–positive
cells = 35.84 F 13.85%; Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S4). These data
suggest that the synergistic death induced by bortezomib and
IFN-a is dependent on caspase activation.
Bortezomib and IFN-A can overcome elevated expression of
prosurvival proteins and promote apoptosis in melanoma
cells. The Bcl-2 family of mitochondrial proteins inhibits apoptosis
by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane (32) and downregulation of these proteins has been shown to contribute to the
induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis in response to bortezomib (33). Mcl-1 promotes cell survival through its antagonistic
interactions with the proapoptotic protein Bax, whereas Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL have been shown to directly antagonize Bak (34). The Bcl-2
and Mcl-1 proteins are often overexpressed in melanoma and have
been shown to affect the susceptibility of melanoma cells to apoptotic stimuli in other systems (35–37). Decreased levels of Bcl-2
and Mcl-1 were also observed following treatment of melanoma
cell lines with bortezomib and IFN-a (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Bcl-xL
and Bax expression was not affected by treatment with bortezomib
or bortezomib plus IFN-a (Fig. 3A). The ability of this treatment
combination to stimulate processing of effector caspases and
down-regulate levels of prosurvival Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins
initially suggested that bortezomib and IFN-a might promote the
intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by modulation of protein targets
within the mitochondria. To further test the importance of the
intrinsic pathway in mediating apoptosis, and to determine
whether this treatment combination could induce apoptosis in
the presence of high Bcl-2 levels, Bcl-2 was overexpressed in the
human A375 melanoma cell line. Twenty-four hours following
transient transfection with either the pcDNA3-Bcl-2 vector or
pcDNA3 control vector, cells were treated for an additional 48 h
with PBS, bortezomib, IFN-a, or both agents combined. Cells
transfected with the unmodified pcDNA3 vector displayed 60% cell
death and a characteristic decrease in Bcl-2 protein expression
48 h following treatment with bortezomib plus IFN-a (Fig. 3B).
However, melanoma cells transfected with the pcDNA3-Bcl-2
construct remained sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of
bortezomib plus IFN-a, as indicated by the cleavage of PARP
(arrow; lanes 4 and 8). In addition, cell death as measured by
trypan blue exclusion was only slightly reduced at 48 h, despite the
presence of high levels of Bcl-2 at all time points in all four
conditions.
Experiments using the pCR3.1-Mcl-1 vector indicated that
melanoma cells overexpressing Mcl-1 also remained sensitive to
the proapoptotic effects of bortezomib and IFN-a compared with
cells transfected with the negative control vector (Fig. 3C).
Interestingly, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 levels did not decrease when cells
were treated with bortezomib and IFN-a in the presence of a pancaspase inhibitor (Fig. 3D). These results indicated that the
observed reductions in levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were likely due
to the cleavage of these proteins by activated caspases and were
not due to a direct modulation of Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 by bortezomib and
IFN-a. Taken together, these data suggest that bortezomib and
IFN-a may be an effective means of promoting cell death in cells

www.aacrjournals.org

that have developed resistance to apoptosis due to elevated
expression of prosurvival proteins.
Bortezomib and IFN-A induce apoptosis via FADD-mediated
caspase-8 activation. Our previous data suggested that bortezomib and IFN-a may induce apoptosis of melanoma cells through a
mechanism that is independent of the mitochondrial, intrinsic
pathway of apoptosis. We therefore investigated the role of the
extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in mediating bortezomib-induced
and IFN-a–induced cell death. Although caspase-9 is activated via
the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, the extrinsic pathway of
apoptosis involves processing of procaspase-8 and subsequent
cleavage of Bid (a proapoptotic BH3-only protein) in response to
the binding of death receptors by their cognate ligands (e.g., TRAIL,
TNF-a, and FasL; ref. 38). Immunoblot analysis revealed that
treatment of human melanoma cell lines with bortezomib plus
IFN-a led to enhanced processing of initiator caspase-8 and
caspase-9 and reduced levels of native Bid, a proapoptotic BH3only protein (Fig. 4A). The caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK did
not significantly inhibit apoptosis of melanoma cells in response to
bortezomib and IFN-a (data not shown); however, the caspase-8
inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK significantly inhibited cell death at the
48-h time point (mean % of Annexin V–positive cells = 20 F 5.4%;
n = 3 experiments) when compared with cells cultured in the
presence of a negative control inhibitor (mean % of Annexin
V–positive cells = 71 F 4.2%; P = 0.004; Fig. 4B). These data suggest
that caspase-8 is activated first in response to treatment with
bortezomib and IFN-a and that caspase-9 is processed in a
secondary fashion by activated caspase-8. Interestingly, no
detectable levels of TNF-a, TRAIL, or FasL protein were evident
in cell culture supernatants from melanoma cell lines following
treatment with bortezomib and IFN-a (data not shown). Although
FasL and Fas proteins were detectable in whole-cell lysates from
untreated melanoma cell lines, treatment with bortezomib and
IFN-a did not alter the expression level of these proteins in any cell
line tested (data not shown).
Importantly, immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an antiFas antibody followed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-FADD
antibody revealed that there was a significant increase in the
association between these two proteins before the onset of cell
death following a 16-h cotreatment with bortezomib and IFN-a
(Fig. 4C). The association of Fas and FADD and subsequent
activation of caspase-8 and induction of apoptosis can occur via
both FasL-dependent and FasL-independent mechanisms (39).
Importantly, bortezomib and IFN-a were significantly less
effective at inducing apoptosis in melanoma cells transfected
with a FADD-DN construct that lacks the death effector domain,
and therefore cannot bind procaspase-8 (FADD-DN; Fig. 4D).
Similarly, siRNA-mediated reduction of cellular Fas inhibited cell
death mediated via bortezomib and IFN-a (Supplementary
Fig. S5). We also observed a decrease in the basal expression of
FADD in cells treated with bortezomib and IFN-a at the 48-h time
point. This event is likely due to nonspecific cleavage of
intracellular proteins by activated caspases as was observed for
Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 (Fig. 3D). Together, these data suggest that
bortezomib and IFN-a activate caspase-8 and induce apoptosis
following the association of Fas and FADD.
Combined administration of bortezomib and IFN-A prolongs survival in a murine model of malignant melanoma. The
effects of combined treatment with bortezomib and IFN-a were
studied in an i.p. murine model of B16 malignant melanoma in
which immune-competent mice routinely succumb to fatal disease

Figure 3. Bortezomib and IFN-a induce apoptosis in melanoma cells that overexpress Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. A, combined treatment with bortezomib (10 nmol/L) plus
IFN-a (104 units/mL) results in decreased levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and no change in the expression of Bcl-xL and Bax. A375 melanoma cells were treated with PBS,
IFN-a (104 units/mL), bortezomib (20 nmol/L), or both agents combined 24 h following transient transfection with the (B) pcDNA3-Bcl-2 construct, (C ) pcR3.1-Mcl-1
construct, or empty vector (negative control). Lysates were evaluated for Bcl-2 expression and cleavage of PARP via immunoblot analysis. Viability of cells used
to make lysates in each experiment was evaluated using trypan blue staining. Transfection efficiency in all experiments was typically >90% as determined by
transfection of A375 cells with a green fluorescent protein expression vector in parallel. All blots shown are representative of n = 3 experiments with similar results. Error
bars are derived from n = 3 separate experiments in the A375 melanoma cell line. Comparable data were obtained using cells stably transfected with either construct
following selection of transfected clones for 7 d with G418 (data not shown). D, decreased levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 are the result of caspase activation. A375
cells were treated with PBS, IFN-a (104 units/mL), bortezomib (10 nmol/L), or both agents combined in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK or a
negative control compound (Z-FA-FMK) at a 50 Amol/L concentration for 48 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis for caspase-3 cleavage and for Mcl-1
and Bcl-2 expression. Membranes were also probed with an anti-h-actin antibody to control for loading. Arrows, cleaved forms of caspase-3 or PARP. Viability of
cells used to make lysates for immunoblot analysis in each experiment was evaluated using trypan blue staining.

burden after 12 to 14 days (19). Daily i.p. administration of IFN-a
alone led to a significant improvement in survival of tumor-bearing
mice compared with mice treated with PBS alone {PBS median
survival = 15 days [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 14–15]; IFN-a
median survival = 21 days (95% CI, 17–28+; P = 0.02)}. Mice
receiving bortezomib as a single agent (twice weekly) also displayed
a significant improvement in survival compared with PBS-treated
mice [bortezomib median survival = 21 days (95% CI, 17–21; P <
0.01)]. However, the median survival of mice treated with
bortezomib and IFN-a combined was significantly enhanced when
compared with mice treated with PBS (P < 0.001), IFN-a (P = 0.02),
or bortezomib alone [P < 0.001; bortezomib plus IFN-a median
survival = 27 days (95% CI, 22–30); Fig. 5A]. No remarkable
alterations in the weight or behavior of tumor-bearing mice
were evident when IFN-a was administered with bortezomib
(Supplementary Fig. S6).
A tumor xenograft model of human A375 melanoma in BALB/
cnu/nu mice was also used to evaluate the antitumor effects of this
treatment combination in vivo. Administration of IFN-a2b or
bortezomib as single agents led to a significant inhibition of tumor
growth compared with control mice treated with PBS (P < 0.05).
Coadministration of bortezomib and IFN-a2b to A375-bearing
animals also led to a statistically significant inhibition of tumor
growth compared with either agent alone (P = 0.047 versus
bortezomib; P = 0.0004 versus IFN-a; Fig. 5B). Histologic analysis
revealed significantly greater apoptosis in tumors derived from
mice treated with bortezomib and IFN compared with tumors from
PBS-treated mice as determined by TUNEL staining (P = 0.038,
ANOVA; Fig. 5C and D). No significant differences in the percentage
of TUNEL-positive cells were observed in tumors from combination-treated mice compared with mice treated with IFN-a or
bortezomib as single agents (P > 0.05). Prior studies have shown
that combined treatment with bortezomib and IFN-a2b led to
inhibition of angiogenesis in athymic mice bearing human bladder
cancer tumors (5). However, no difference in the microvessel
density of tumors as detected by CD31 immunostaining was
observed in any treatment group of the present study (Supplementary Fig. S7).

Discussion
We have shown that bortezomib and IFN-a induce synergistic
apoptosis in human melanoma cell lines and that cell death was
dependent on caspase activation. The proapoptotic effects of this
treatment combination were significantly reduced following
inhibition of caspase-8 and in the presence of a dominant-negative
form of the FADD protein or Fas-specific siRNA. Combined
treatment with bortezomib and IFN-a also led to a significant
prolongation of survival in a murine model of melanoma and
significantly reduced tumor growth in a xenograft model of human
melanoma in athymic mice compared with either agent alone. The
present study shows that this treatment combination may have
utility for the treatment of melanoma.
Our initial experiments showed that treatment of melanoma cell
lines with bortezomib and IFN-a led to processing of procaspase-9
and decreased levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. These data suggested that
the mitochondrial pathway could be involved in promoting
apoptosis in response to this treatment combination (40). Previous
studies by Nencioni and colleagues (33) have eloquently shown that
apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibition and TRAIL may
involve both the cleavage of Bcl-2 to a fragment with putative

www.aacrjournals.org

proapoptotic activity and the elimination of antiapoptotic Mcl-1.
However, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 protein levels remained stable in the
presence of a caspase inhibitor and overexpression of these
prosurvival proteins or caspase-9 inhibition did not protect
melanoma cells from the apoptotic program induced by bortezomib plus IFN-a. Therefore, reduced levels of these proteins in
this panel of cell lines after treatment were likely the result of
nonspecific cleavage by activated caspase proteins rather than an
initiating event of the apoptotic program. The activation of
caspase-9 and decreased expression levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in
this system likely serve to amplify the process of apoptosis once
it has been initiated.
We subsequently hypothesized that this treatment combination
might lead to increased production of death receptor ligands (i.e.,
TRAIL, TNF-a, and FasL) by the melanoma cells. Previous reports
have shown that either bortezomib or IFN-a can activate the
extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in this manner (41). In addition,
Papageorgiou and colleagues (5) have shown that combined
therapy with IFN-a and bortezomib enhances apoptosis of human
bladder cancer cell lines by a TRAIL-associated mechanism.
Although treatment with a caspase-8 inhibitor led to a significant
decrease in cell death in the present study, the endogenous
expression of TRAIL, TNF-a, or FasL was not observed in either
culture supernatants or lysates from melanoma cells treated with
bortezomib and IFN-a (data not shown). Furthermore, previous
studies have shown that TRAIL expression is not induced in A375
melanoma cells following treatment with type I IFNs (42), but A375
cells remained sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of combined
therapy with bortezomib and IFN-a.
Despite the absence of a defined death receptor ligand, we
observed an increased association between Fas and FADD in
multiple melanoma cell lines before the onset of cell death.
Furthermore, transfection of A375 melanoma cells with a FADDDN construct or Fas-specific siRNA significantly inhibited the
proapoptotic effects of bortezomib and IFN-a. Although increased
binding between Fas and FasL can activate caspase-8 and initiate
the apoptotic process (43), other reports have suggested that
processing of procaspase-8 can be a downstream consequence of
Bid cleavage (44). However, the timing of Bid cleavage in the
present model does not support this conclusion. Our data suggest
that caspase-8 activation and subsequent apoptosis is initiated by
Fas trimerization and its association with FADD independent of
FasL (39). The precise molecular events leading to an association
between Fas and FADD proteins in the present model are under
investigation.
The antitumor properties of bortezomib have been attributed
to inhibition of InB degradation, which leads to inactivation of
nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), a prosurvival transcription factor that is
constitutively activated in many melanoma cell lines (16, 45, 46).
However, our preliminary data indicated that bortezomib did not
decrease the levels of NF-nB DNA binding or transcriptional
activity in melanoma cell lines as measured by gel shift assay or
analysis of NF-nB reporter activity in cells transfected with the
3xnB-Luc NF-nB promoter luciferase construct (data not shown).
In addition, other groups have recently shown that inhibition of
NF-nB activity accounts for only a portion of the antitumor activity
of bortezomib (47, 48). Previous studies by Qin and colleagues (49)
and Fernandez and colleagues (50) have also described a role for
the BH3-only protein Noxa in mediating the proapoptotic effects of
proteasome inhibition in melanoma cell lines. However, we did not
detect an increase in Noxa transcript or protein in these particular

Figure 4. Bortezomib and IFN-a act via FADD-induced caspase-8 activation to initiate cell death. A, cell lysates were evaluated by immunoblot analysis for processing
of procaspase-8 (55 kDa) into its cleaved 43- and 41-kDa fragments and procaspase-9 (47 kDa) into its cleaved 37- and 35-kDa fragments and for levels of native
Bid protein (22 kDa) following a 48-h treatment with PBS, IFN-a (104 units/mL), bortezomib (10 nmol/L), or both agents combined. B, A375 cells were treated with PBS,
IFN-a, bortezomib, or both agents combined in the presence of the Z-IETD-FMK caspase-8 inhibitor or Z-FA-FMK negative control compound at a 50 Amol/L
concentration for 48 h. C, Fas and FADD associate before bortezomib-induced and IFN-a–induced apoptosis. Following a 16-h treatment with PBS, IFN-a, bortezomib,
or both agents combined, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Fas antibody, and blots were probed with an anti-FADD antibody (or anti-Fas antibody
to control for loading). Comparable data were obtained in 1259 MEL, 18105 MEL, and A375 cell lines. D, bortezomib-induced and IFN-a–induced apoptosis is inhibited
by a FADD-DN construct. Twenty-four hours following transient transfection with the pcDNA3-FADD-DN or pcDNA3 vectors, A375 melanoma cells were treated
for an additional 48 h with PBS, IFN-a, bortezomib, or both agents combined. Lysates were evaluated for FADD expression (or its lower molecular weight, truncated
form) and cleavage of PARP as a marker of apoptosis via immunoblot analysis. Viability of cells used to make lysates for immunoblot analysis in each experiment
was evaluated using trypan blue staining.

Interferon-a and Bortezomib Induce Apoptosis

Figure 5. A, treatment with bortezomib plus IFN-a enhances survival in a murine model of malignant melanoma. B16F1 cells (106) were injected i.p. into
C57BL/6 mice (n = 11 per treatment group). One day following tumor challenge, mice were treated i.p. with either PBS (negative control), bortezomib alone
(1 mg/kg, twice weekly), IFN-a alone (2  104 units/d), or a combination of bortezomib and IFN-a. B, treatment with bortezomib plus IFN-a inhibits the growth of
human melanoma xenografts in athymic mice. Human A375 cells (2  106) were injected s.c. into BALB/cnu/nu mice (n = 4–6 per group). Mice were treated with
PBS, bortezomib, IFN-a, or both agents combined. Points, mean tumor volume within each group (mm3) between individual animals; bars, SD. C, mice were
euthanized on day 25 whereupon tumors were harvested and stained by TUNEL, and percentages of apoptotic cells were quantified manually. Columns, mean
(n = 4–6 per group); bars, SD. *, P = 0.038 versus PBS-treated controls. D, a representative tumor section from mice treated with bortezomib and IFN-a combined

melanoma cell lines following treatment with bortezomib plus
IFN-a compared with bortezomib alone (Supplementary Fig. S8).
These observations suggest that the proapoptotic effects of bortezomib may proceed by different mechanisms depending on the
melanoma cell line under study and are augmented in a unique
manner when coadministered with IFN-a.
Together, these preclinical data suggest that combined
treatment with bortezomib and IFN-a represents a novel
treatment strategy for inducing a direct, proapoptotic effect on
tumor cells. We are currently evaluating the safety and
tolerability of this treatment combination in an investigatorinitiated phase I clinical trial at our institution. Elucidation of
the pathways of cell death induced by this treatment
combination may help to identify key molecular targets that
govern the viability of melanoma cells that can be further
manipulated to provide an antitumor effect.
