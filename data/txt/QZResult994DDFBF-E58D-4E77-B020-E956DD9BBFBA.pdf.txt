Measuring Response to BCR-ABL Inhibitors
in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
Jerald P. Radich, MD

In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the hallmark Philadelphia chromosome is the marker of disease that
can be detected by conventional metaphase cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or polymerase chain
reaction. The current ‘‘gold standard’’ of treatment response is cytogenetic response. Cytogenetic response to imatinib is strongly associated with disease progression and survival. Various strategies aimed at improving cytogenetic
response have been explored, such as escalation of imatinib and switching to the newer breakpoint cluster region/vabl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (BCR-ABL) inhibitors dasatinib and nilotinib. Data from recent randomized trials of dasatinib and nilotinib as first-line therapy of newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML suggest that these
agents are more effective than imatinib in achieving 6-month and 12-month complete cytogenetic responses. However, it is still too early to know whether or not this early response will translate into a long-term survival advantage.
In addition, more sensitive assays to detect residual disease also may be associated with improved long-term outcomes. The deepest measure of response—a complete molecular response—may help identify patients who can stop
taking imatinib for the short term, although the long-term consequences of this strategy remain unknown. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease characterized by the oncogenic Philadelphia
chromosome, which is formed by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22.1,2 This translocation causes
50 portions of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene from chromosome 22 to juxtapose with the 30 tyrosine kinase
domains of the v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (ABL) from chromosome 9. The novel chimeric protein
BCR-ABL dictates the pathophysiology of CML.3-6
CML accounts for approximately 20% of all adult cases of leukemia.7 The age-adjusted incidence rate in the United
States is 1.5 per 100,000 population per year, and the median age at diagnosis is 66 years.8 Clinically, CML is divided into
3 phases, although molecular data suggest that the disease actually comprises 2 phases: chronic phase (CP and advanced
phase (AP).9 The initial CP often has a relatively benign presentation with an expansion of normal myeloid cells; however,
if left untreated, unopposed BCR-ABL activity will foster genetic instability, causing genetic changes that lead to
advanced-phase disease with an AP and a blast phase (BP).10 The treatment of advanced-phase disease is woefully inadequate compared with that for CP, no matter which therapy is used.
The treatment of CML with the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib has revolutionized management of the disease, relegating the role of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation to that of salvage therapy. The more potent and newer BCRABL inhibitors, nilotinib and dasatinib, were approved first to treat patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant
disease, but recent randomized trials have led to approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for nilotinib and dasatinib as first-line therapy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend both dasatinib
and nilotinib as first-line therapy options.11 Given this new embarrassment of riches, how do we decide which BCR-ABL
inhibitor to start patients on and when to switch?

Measuring BCR-ABL Response in CML/Radich

Measuring Response: Tools and Endpoints
The earliest and most easily measured disease response is
normalization of the peripheral white blood cell (WBC)
count or complete hematologic remission (CHR), which
generally occurs within 3 months in the vast majority
(>90%) of newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP who
receive treatment with a BCR-ABL inhibitor. The next
disease-response level hinges on the cytogenetic response
from a bone marrow sample. Cytogenetic response currently is considered the ‘‘gold standard’’ of treatment
response. Typically, cytogenetic responses are divided
into several categories, which usually are determined by
metaphase chromosome analysis (using 20 metaphases)
of the bone marrow (Table 1).12 Responses range from
none; through minimal, minor, and partial; and up to a
complete cytogenetic response (CCyR). In addition, the
category of major cytogenetic response (MCyR) includes
both CCyR and partial cytogenetic responses (PCyR).
Cytogenetic testing also can detect secondary clonal evolution, which is indicative of disease progression to accelerated phase. Although fluorescence in situ hybridization
on blood cells also can be used to assess the level of cytogenetic response, it is not a recommended replacement for
cytogenetic testing of bone marrow, because it does not
detect secondary cytogenetic abnormalities. However, fluorescence in situ hybridization is an acceptable alternative
if insufficient numbers of bone marrow cell metaphases
are available for analysis or if bone marrow sampling is
not possible.12 The most sensitive tool for assessing disease status is real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), which measures the fusion BCR-ABL
messenger RNA transcript. Not only is it exquisitely sensitive, but QPCR also has the added advantage of analyzing
peripheral blood rather than a bone marrow specimen.
Cytogenetic Response to Imatinib Therapy
A treatment recommendation for newly diagnosed CMLCP is oral imatinib 400 mg once daily.11-13 Substantial
data justify this recommendation. The International
Randomized Study of Interferon versus STI571 (IRIS), a
large phase 3 randomized trial (N ¼ 553) in patients with
CML-CP, demonstrated a superior 18-month CCyR rate
(76% of patients who received imatinib vs 15% of
those who received interferon plus cytarabine14). An 8year follow-up study indicated rates of event-free survival
(EFS) and freedom from progression to advanced disease
of 81% and 92%, respectively.15 It should be noted, however, that, in the definition of EFS in the IRIS trial, discontinuation of therapy was not counted as an event.

Complete and partial responses are often grouped under the category
‘‘major’’ (see National Comprehensive Cancer Network 201011).

After 8 years of follow-up, 55% of patients remained on
imatinib therapy.15 Thus, clinical use surveys and population studies have indicated that resistance to or intolerance
of imatinib prevents many patients from gaining the full
benefit of treatment; CCyR rates in patients who are
treated in nontrial settings appear to be lower than in the
controlled setting of clinical studies.16-19 After 8 years of
follow-up, 6% of patients had discontinued because of
adverse events or other safety reasons, 16% had discontinued because of an unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome, 3%
had undergone stem cell transplantation, 3% had died,
and 17% had discontinued for other reasons.15
Data from numerous imatinib trials have established
CCyR as an important predictor of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Five-year follow-up
and data analysis from the IRIS trial indicated that
patients who achieved a CCyR at 12 months were more
likely than others not to progress to AP or BP by 60
months (97% vs 81%).20 Additional analyses revealed
that patients who achieved a CCyR also had superior OS
compared with those who did not reach this milestone.21
Six-year follow-up data and analysis from the same trial
also suggested that achieving a CCyR within 6 months of
the initiation of therapy may be an important predictive
factor for PFS.22 An analysis of IRIS data after a minimum follow-up of 8 years indicates that patients who
achieved less than a CCyR at 18 months had a probability
of only 29% of achieving a CCyR without a subsequent
event (defined as death, transformation to advanced disease, loss of CHR or MCyR, or increased WBC count to
>20  109/L).15
Five-year data from the Hammersmith group demonstrated similar results to those from the IRIS study:
Patients who achieved a CCyR at 12 months demonstrated
a benefit in terms of both PFS (with progression defined as
the development of advanced disease) and OS compared
with patients who did not achieve a CCyR at 12 months

(PFS, 96% vs 74%; OS, 98% vs 74%).18 Other studies
also have demonstrated a significant association between
CCyR at 12 months and improved PFS.23,24
Indicators of Response: The More
Sensitive, the Better?
The IRIS study investigators defined a major molecular
response (MMR) as a 3-log reduction in the BCR-ABL
messenger RNA level compared with levels in an aggregate
of baseline samples.25 Several studies have borne out the
positive clinical significance of achieving an MMR,
although a few others have not. A 12-month landmark
analysis of the IRIS trial demonstrated that the 2-year PFS
rate was 100% in patients who achieved a CCyR and an
MMR, 95% in patients who achieved a CCyR but no
MMR, and 85% in patients who achieved neither a
CCyR nor an MMR (with progression defined as death,
the development of advanced CML, increasing WBC
count, or loss of CHR or MCyR in the initial publication).25 In a study of 90 patients who achieved a CCyR
(median follow-up, 49 months), it was observed that
relapse-free survival was significantly shorter in patients
who did not achieve an MMR than in those who attained
this landmark (median time not reached).26 In addition,
an analysis of follow-up data from a phase 2 study suggested that the estimated 6-year EFS rate was significantly
higher in patients who achieved both an MMR and a
CCyR (100%) than in those who achieved only a CCyR
(44%; P ¼ .0001).27 However, an 18-month landmark
analysis of the IRIS study indicated that 5-year PFS did
not differ significantly between patients with both CCyR
and MMR (100%) and those with CCyR only (98%;
with progression defined as the development of advanced
CML).20 Moreover, in a retrospective analysis of patients
with CML-CP who received imatinib (n ¼ 276), landmark analyses at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and
24 months failed to identify any significant association
between OS and achieving an MMR while in CCyR.
Durable MMRs (documented continuously for >12
months) were associated with longer PFS (defined as loss
of hematologic or cytogenetic response, death, or development of advanced CML) but not with longer OS.28
A recent follow-up of the IRIS trial29 suggested that
achieving an MMR was associated with superior EFS than
achieving a CCyR but without an MMR. Serial molecular
studies were evaluated based on the International Scale, in
which a value of 0.1% represents MMR and values
from >0.1% to 1% represent CCyR.13 Patients who had
BCR-ABL transcripts >1% at 12 months had inferior

302

EFS and higher rates of progression to AP/BP compared
with patients who had lower levels of molecular response.
Patients who achieved an MMR at 18 months had no progressions to AP/BP and had a 95% EFS rate at 7 years.
The probability of losing a CCyR was 3% for patients
who achieved an MMR at 18 months compared with
26% for patients who achieved a CCyR but no MMR.
Similar near absence of progression in patients who
achieved an MMR also has been reported in front-line
studies of nilotinib30 and dasatinib31 and in US and
Canada Intergroup trial S0325 comparing dasatinib
and imatinib.32
Thus, the majority of the data for MMR point to a
‘‘safe haven’’ with a very low risk of progression to
advanced-phase disease or loss of CCyR. It is not surprising that achieving an MMR is not clearly associated with
superior OS compared with achieving a CCyR. Fortunately, patients who fail initial imatinib therapy can be
salvaged with a newer BCR-ABL inhibitor and, thus, can
survive despite initially failing front-line therapy.
Currently, there is an effort to encourage all laboratories to adopt the International Scale to standardize
QPCR results because of issues with interlaboratory variability.33 Without this scale, interpreting molecular data
is more difficult, although it is not impossible if the laboratory 1) fully understands the characteristics of their test
and 2) has an idea of what a baseline test result is in the
aggregate of patients with newly diagnosed CML who are
referred for their assay. Without these parameters, physicians and patients will struggle with the meaning of the
molecular test and certainly will have difficulty in judging
where they stand with regard to MMR.
The achievement of MMR has been associated with
the eventual achievement of a complete molecular
response (CMR).34 Thus, patients who achieved an
MMR by 12 months had a cumulative incidence of subsequently obtaining a CMR of approximately 75% compared with <10% for patients who were not in MMR.
CMR has become an interesting endpoint, because it
appears that some patients in prolonged CMR may discontinue therapy and remain in CMR. A study by Mahon
et al assessed imatinib discontinuation in patients who
had maintained a CMR for at least 2 years. Those investigators observed that 61% of patients relapsed after discontinuing imatinib therapy (most within 6 months), but all
could be retreated with response, although not all patients
achieved a second CMR. At a median follow-up of 17
months, 39% of those patients remained off BCR-ABL
inhibitor therapy.35

Measuring BCR-ABL Response in CML/Radich

CMR is obviously an attractive endpoint for both
patients and physicians, but several caveats should be
noted. First, with current therapy, CMR is relatively unusual, occurring in <5% of patients who receive treatment with imatinib at 12 months.25,30 Although this
prevalence may increase with time, it still is expected that
few patients will attain a persistent CMR. Second,
although patients who relapse have been retreated effectively, it should be emphasized that, even in CMR, there
likely resides a pool of CML ‘‘stem cells.’’ Because these
cells are spared BCR-ABL inhibition, there may be clones
that begin to take on genetic changes, which put them on
the pathway to progression. If so, then patients who
appear to be doing well with retreatment may be at risk
several years down the line. Thus, discontinuation of
BCR-ABL inhibitors should only be done in the context
of a clinical trial. The third issue concerning CMR is the
evolving concept of what it actually means. If a CMR is
defined as an ‘‘undetectable’’ BCR-ABL signal, then this
must be interpreted in the context of the sensitivity of the
assay and the adequacy of the sample: That is, an undetectable test can occur from a poor assay (poor sensitivity)
or a poor sample (not enough cells sampled).
How Should Patients Be Monitored
in Routine Practice?
The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and the NCCN have
developed guidelines and recommendations for the treatment and monitoring of patients with CML; these include
criteria defining optimal responses, suboptimal responses,
and failure of response to imatinib treatment.11-13 The
‘‘optimal’’ response to imatinib therapy is attaining a
CCyR after 12 months of treatment.12,18,20,21,24 Treatment failure calls for a change in therapy.12 According to
ELN and NCCN criteria, a patient who fails to achieve
either a CHR by 3 months, or any cytogenetic response
by 6 months, or an MCyR by 12 months, or a CCyR by
18 months of therapy is deemed an imatinib failure. Likewise, loss of cytogenetic response also necessitates a change
in treatment and appropriate mutation analysis.12
To monitor therapeutic responses over time, cytogenetic assessment should be performed at diagnosis, 3
months and 6 months after treatment initiation, and every
6 months thereafter until a CCyR is achieved.12 The need
for further cytogenetic testing after the achievement of a
CCyR is under debate. The ELN prefers yearly cytogenetic assessment; new clonal abnormalities in Philadelphia
chromosome-negative cells may occur in some patients
(approximately 5%) in CCyR.13 Most of these clonal

Cancer

abnormalities involve trisomy 8 and appear to be benign.13 However, some cases involving additional clonal
abnormalities have the cytogenetic and clinical characteristics of a secondary myelodysplastic syndrome or acute
myeloid leukemia.36-38 The NCCN recommends that
mutational analysis would be useful to identify a subset of
patients at increased risk of progression as a result of cytogenetic mutation.11 Furthermore, if there is a persistent
and unexplained drop in blood counts, then the NCCN
guidelines recommend bone marrow cytogenetic analysis
to rule out non-Philadelphia chromosome-related chromosomal abnormalities or myelodysplasia.11
Imatinib Resistance and the Importance
of Prolonged Response
Although it is clear that BCR-ABL inhibitor treatment of
newly diagnosed CML-CP radically changes the natural
history of the disease, it is unclear whether a ‘‘cure’’ is a
reasonable expectation. Thus, the more immediate and
useful clinical goal is to prevent transformation to CMLAP/BP as long as possible, because advanced disease carries such a dire prognosis (Table 2).14,39-48
The chief obstacle to achieving prolonged responses
to BCR-ABL inhibitor therapy is resistance. Primary
(intrinsic) resistance is defined as failure to achieve the
landmark outcomes (CHR and CCyR), whereas secondary (acquired) resistance is defined as loss of therapeutic
response.49
Development of resistance is a major concern in the
treatment of CML. An intent-to-treat analysis revealed
that 26% of patients discontinued imatinib after a median
follow-up of 15.5 months because of lack of efficacy or
progressive disease.18 A survey of clinical use reported disease progression and/or loss of response to imatinib in
12% of patients with CML, and a population study indicated that approximately 50% of patients with newly
diagnosed CML-CP who were receiving imatinib failed to
achieve or maintain a CCyR and/or progressed to
advanced disease.17,19
Targeting Resistance
The most common mechanism of imatinib resistance is
the acquisition of a point mutation in the ABL tyrosine
kinase domain. BCR-ABL mutations occur in approximately 50% of patients who develop resistance to
imatinib.50,51 The phosphate-binding loop (P-loop)
(residues 248-256) is the most common mutation site
(Table 3).52,53 Certain P-loop mutations confer a high
level of insensitivity to imatinib and are associated with a

poor prognosis, although some of these patients can
benefit from the use of new BCR-ABL inhibitors.50,54-57
Studies conducted before the availability of the newer
BCR-ABL inhibitors suggested that patients with P-loop
mutations had poorer outcomes, with rapid progression
to advanced CML disease.50,55,56 The most worrisome
mutation is the threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at
codon 315 (T315I), because none of the currently available BCR-ABL inhibitors blocks its ABL activity.7,50,57
Patients who harbor this mutation should be offered stem
cell transplantation or entry into a clinical trial of a novel
agent.12 Other mechanisms that may affect imatinib sensitivity include altered expression of drug influx and efflux
proteins (ie, phosphoglycolate phosphatase [Pgp] and

304

octamer-binding protein [OCT-1]), pathologic activation
of SRC family kinases, clonal evolution, and over expression of BCR-ABL.7,57-62
Second-Generation BCR-ABL
Inhibitors and Resistance
Dasatinib and nilotinib were approved first for the treatment
of patients with CML who were resistant to or intolerant of
first-line therapy with imatinib. Dasatinib and nilotinib are
treatment options for patients who experience failure of imatinib therapy either by not achieving a CCyR by 18 months
or through loss of a previously attained CCyR.12
Both dasatinib and nilotinib are highly active in
patients with CML. A phase 3 trial of second-line

dasatinib 100 mg once daily in patients with CML-CP
(n ¼ 167) demonstrated a CCyR rate of 50% by 24
months (best response; minimum follow-up, 2 years);
89% of patients who achieved a CCyR within 2 years
maintained it at 24 months.40,63 In another phase 3 second-line trial, 32% of patients with CML-AP who
received dasatinib 140 mg once daily (n ¼ 158; median
follow-up, 15 months) achieved a CCyR.44
In a phase 2 study of patients who received secondline nilotinib (n ¼ 321), including those with CML-CP,
the CCyR rate was 46% at a minimum follow-up of 19
months; 84% of those CCyRs were maintained at 24
months,48 and the 24-month PFS and OS rates were 64%
and 87%, respectively (with progression defined as the
development of advanced disease, discontinuation because
of advanced disease, or death). In patients with CML-AP
(n ¼ 137), the CCyR rate after a minimum follow-up of
11 months was 20%; of those responses, 83% were maintained at 12 months.45 A CCyR rate of 29% also has been
reported in patients with CML-BP (n ¼ 136).39
Two studies of dasatinib have demonstrated the clinical significance of achieving a CCyR in the second-line
treatment of CML-CP. In a phase 3 dose-optimization
study, the PFS rate at 36 months was greater in patients
who achieved a CCyR at 6 months (93%) than in those
who achieved only a PCyR (76%) or less than a PCyR
(54%). Similarly, the 36-month PFS rate was greater in
patients who achieved a CCyR at 12 months (90%) than in
those who achieved only a PCyR (77%) or a lesser cytogenetic response (63%).64 A retrospective study of 1067
patients with CML-CP indicated that those who received
dasatinib and achieved a CCyR at 12 months had a higher
24-month PFS rate than patients who did not attain a
CCyR or an MMR (97% vs 78%); progression in that
analysis was defined based on the phase 3 optimization
study (eg, progression to AP/BP, loss of CHR or MCyR,
increasing WBC count, or death).65
Mutation Data: What Do They Mean?
The type of BCR-ABL mutation potentially can influence
which BCR-ABL inhibitor should be given to patients
who fail on imatinib.12,66,67 The most common BCRABL mutations and their sensitivity to approved BCRABL inhibitors are listed in Table 3. It should be noted,
however, that sensitivity values in the table were derived
from artificial in vitro settings and, thus, may not always
correlate with the actual sensitivity to a mutant clone in a
given patient. However, there appear to be cases in which
particular mutations can influence the decision-making in

Cancer

January 15, 2012

choosing the best ‘‘fit’’ with the activity of a particular second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor. For example, in a
phase 2 study of second-line nilotinib in imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant patients, there were no
patients with the T315I, tyrosine-to-histidine at codon
253 (Y253H), glutamic acid-to-valine at codon 255
(E255V), or phenylalanine-to-glutamine/valine at codon
359 (F359C/V) mutations who achieved a CCyR.68,69 In
that study, the most common mutations associated with
disease progression during nilotinib treatment were the
glutamic acid-to-lysine/valine at codon 255 (E255K/V),
F359C/V, Y253H, and T315I mutations.70 A retrospective analysis of dasatinib clinical data according to mutation status after imatinib failure (n ¼ 1043) indicated that
no patients with T315I mutations and only 7% of
patients with phenylalanine-to-leucine at codon 317
(F317L) mutations achieved a CCyR.71 In a phase 3
dose-optimizing study of patients with CML-CP, newly
developing mutations associated with loss of response to
dasatinib were T315I, F317L, V299L, and, rarely,
E255K.64 The study by Branford et al66 assessed how
often patients had mutations that would specifically
direct subsequent, newer BCR-ABL inhibitor therapy.
Those authors observed that 43% of resistant patients
who harbored mutations carried mutations that were
clinically relevant and that 28% carried mutations that
were clinically relevant for either dasatinib or nilotinib.
It was further estimated from previous data that the percentages of imatinib-resistant patients in CML-CP or
CML-AP who carried clinically relevant mutations were
approximately 18% and 31%, respectively. In patients
with CML-BP, 29% to 52% of patients may carry a
clinically relevant mutation.66
Cytogenetic Response, Resistance,
and the Role of Transplantation
Allogeneic transplantation is curative in CML; however,
given the success of BCR-ABL inhibitor therapy, it is now
generally reserved to salvage patients with resistance to
imatinib who do not respond to a second-generation
BCR-ABL inhibitor, for patients who have the T315I
mutation or advanced-phase disease, or for those rare
patients who have intolerance to all BCR-ABL inhibitors.
The most common clinical question is how to determine
which resistant patients should proceed to undergo transplantation: How long should they wait for a response to
the second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor?
A cytogenetic response to second-line therapy is a
useful parameter for this particular decision. Two studies

305

Review Article

have suggested measures of response to guide second-line
BCR-ABL inhibitor therapy, allowing physicians to
declare failure early and expeditiously proceed to transplantation. These include achieving at least a minimal
cytogenetic response after 3 months of therapy with a secondary BCR-ABL inhibitor and an MCyR by 12
months.72,73 Thus, 1 strategy would be to start a donor
search at the first sign of resistance. Because the process of
human leukocyte antigen typing and donor identification
can take 3 to 6 months, patients who have an inadequate
response at that time point can be moved efficiently to
transplantation.
Can We Improve Response
to First-Line Imatinib?
Several avenues are being explored that may result in
increased CCyR rates and durability. One approach is to
simply increase the starting dose of imatinib. Several
reports suggest that higher dose imatinib (>400 mg daily)
produces faster responses but may have no long-term
impact on either CCyR rates or survival. Data from 2
randomized, phase 3 trials indicate that patients who
received imatinib 800 mg daily achieved a significantly
higher CCyR rate at 6 months than those who received
imatinib 400 mg daily, but there were no significant differences in CCyR rates at 12 months and beyond.74,75
The increasing dose of imatinib also increased drug toxicity, leading to more dose interruptions in the higher dose
imatinib arm, which could have undermined response.
A second suggested approach in the context of imatinib treatment is to titrate patient doses according to trough
plasma drug concentrations. It has been reported that imatinib serum concentrations were significantly lower in
patients who did not achieve a CCyR (694  556 ng/mL;
n ¼ 12) compared with patients who did (1123  617 ng/
mL; n ¼ 56).76 In a subanalysis of patients entered into the
IRIS and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Optimization and Selectivity (TOPS) trials (n ¼ 526), patients who had the
lowest trough levels of imatinib at day 29 of treatment had
inferior rates of CCyR at 12 months.77 However, data
from a different study (n ¼ 78) indicated no correlation
between cytogenetic response rates and trough imatinib
plasma levels at 12 months (CCyR: trough imatinib plasma
level, 1010 ng/mL; no CCyR: trough imatinib plasma
level, 1175 ng/mL).78 Moreover, low imatinib plasma levels may be a result of patient drug metabolism or poor
adherence, and the role of drug monitoring and dose modification in these 2 events probably differs greatly and is
problematic to distinguish.

306

A third approach is to administer imatinib in combination with another compound. One combination partner being explored is interferon-alfa. In the STI571
Prospective Randomized Trial (SPIRIT) (N ¼ 636), the
12-month MMR rate (57% vs 38%; P < .001; unadjusted) and the 24-month MMR rate (64% vs 43%; P ¼
.006; unadjusted) were significantly higher for imatinib
400 mg daily plus pegylated interferon (n ¼ 159) compared with imatinib alone (n ¼ 159). However, 12month CCyR rates did not differ significantly (66% vs
58%; P > .05; unadjusted). The endpoint of survival
without progression to advanced disease within 24
months produced rates of 98% for imatinib 400 mg daily
alone and 97% for imatinib 400 mg daily plus pegylated
interferon.79 However, 2 other large, prospective studies
suggested no efficacy advantage for imatinib plus interferon compared with the same dosage of imatinib
alone.80,81 High interferon discontinuation rates also suggest that clinical applications of imatinib combined with
this compound may be limited.81,82
Finally, patient compliance should be examined in
patients who do not achieve optimal responses. In 1 study,
adherence to imatinib was assessed in 169 Belgian patients
with CML.83 Patients who had ELN-defined suboptimal
responses to imatinib had a higher degree of nonadherence than who achieved optimal responses (23% vs 7%; P
¼ .005).83 In a study of patients who received imatinib
400 mg daily for a median of 60 months and who had
achieved a CCyR (n ¼ 87), adherence measured over 3
months was an independent predictor of the probability
of achieving a 6-year MMR (P ¼ .001).84
Are Second-Generation BCR-ABL Inhibitors
as Front-Line Therapy Better Than Imatinib?
The ‘‘million-dollar question’’ is obviously whether the
more potent, newer BCR-ABL inhibitors are better than
imatinib as front-line therapy for newly diagnosed CML.
Three phase 3, randomized trials suggest that they are, at
least in very early reports of efficacy. Initially, both dasatinib (100 mg daily) and nilotinib (800 mg daily) were
studied in 2 concurrent, phase 2 studies in patients with
untreated CML-CP.45,46,85,86 Dasatinib initially was
administered in 2 schedules: 50 mg twice daily (n ¼ 31)
and 100 mg once daily (n ¼ 31). In the nilotinib trial, all
patients received nilotinib 400 mg twice daily (n ¼ 61).
Data after a median follow-up of 24 months (dasatinib)
and 17 months (nilotinib) indicated that both
compounds induced high rates of CCyR, which were
higher than those anticipated from historic data from

standard-dose or high-dose imatinib therapy (Table
4).45,46,85,86 In a separate phase 2 study of nilotinib in
untreated patients with CML-CP, the 24-month rates of
CCyR and MMR (92% and 82%, respectively) and the
30-month rate of OS (99%) also suggested high activity
for this compound in this setting.87
Dasatinib 100 mg daily and nilotinib 600 mg daily
recently have been approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for the first-line treatment of patients
with CML-CP on the basis of data from 2 randomized
phase 3 comparisons of nilotinib or dasatinib with imatinib. In the Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in
Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed Patients (ENESTnd)
trial, the MMR rate at 12 months was significantly higher
in the nilotinib arms compared with imatinib (nilotinib
600 mg daily, 44%; nilotinib 800 mg daily, 43%; imatinib 400 mg daily, 22%; P < .001).30 After a median follow-up of 18 months, cumulative CCyR rates in the
nilotinib arms were higher compared with imatinib (nilotinib 600 mg daily, 85%; nilotinib 800 mg daily, 82%;
imatinib 400 mg daily, 74%),88 and cumulative MMR
rates in the nilotinib arms were significantly higher compared with imatinib (66%, 62%, and 40%, respectively;
P < .0001).88 Finally, fewer progressions to advancedphase disease occurred in the nilotinib arms (<1% on
either nilotinib schedule vs 4% for imatinib).88
The Dasatinib versus Imatinib Study in TreatmentNaive CML (DASISION) trial compared dasatinib and
standard-dose imatinib (400 mg) in newly diagnosed
patients (N ¼ 519).31 After a minimum follow-up of 12
months, the rate of confirmed CCyR by 12 months was
77% with dasatinib and 66% with imatinib.31 The CCyR
rate by 18 months was superior in the dasatinib arm compared with the imatinib arm (78% vs 70%; P ¼ .0366).
The MMR rate also was greater in patients who received
dasatinib compared with those who received imatinib

(57% vs 41%; P ¼ .0002). In total, 2% of patients who
received dasatinib and 4% of patients who received imatinib transformed to advanced disease.89
Both dasatinib and nilotinib are well tolerated in the
first-line setting. Most drug-related adverse events were
grade 1 or 2 in severity, and grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic events were rare.89
Recently, data from the US and Canada Intergroup
phase 2 study of dasatinib versus imatinib in newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP (S0325) became available. In
that trial, 253 patients were randomized to receive either
dasatinib 100 mg daily or imatinib 400 mg daily. Preliminary analyses are impaired by an incomplete assessment of
all cytogenetic data from the plethora of contributing centers. All outcomes, however incomplete, suggest a striking
similarity to results from the DASISION trial. For example, CCyR rates at 12 months had the same trend between
the dasatinib and imatinib arms (82% vs 69%).32
However, the DASISION, ENESTnd, and Intergroup trials have reported only short-term results.
Although those results appear to be encouraging, there is
no evidence to date that either BCR-ABL inhibitor offers
a long-term difference in OS compared with imatinib. In
addition, imatinib will gain generic status in many countries in a few years, thereby presenting it with an economic
advantage over newer BCR-ABL inhibitors. Until longterm data are available, it is unclear whether the best way
to treat newly diagnosed patients in CP, indeed, is to initiate and maintain therapy with a newer BCR-ABL inhibitor. Plausible alternative strategies include initial
treatment with imatinib and switching to a newer BCRABL inhibitor if aggressive milestones of treatment
response are not met or initial treatment with a newer
BCR-ABL inhibitor followed by the use of generic imatinib as a cheap ‘‘maintenance’’ therapy in optimally
responding patients.

Review Article

In conclusion, the treatment of CML focuses on
prolonging freedom from progression, which translates to
long-term survival. CCyR is a landmark response and a
positive predictive indicator of improved PFS and OS and
can be used to assess the adequacy of treatment response
in the front-line and second-line settings. Dasatinib and
nilotinib are effective for treating patients who are resistant to imatinib, and there are data suggesting that these
agents are more efficacious than imatinib in the first-line
setting. In particular, molecular response rates appear to
be higher with these newer BCR-ABL inhibitors compared with imatinib. This is potentially important,
because several ongoing studies are addressing whether
patients in CMR can discontinue therapy. In general, in
these studies, roughly half of patients who were removed
from BCR-ABL inhibitor therapy retained a CMR with
follow-up of 1 to 2 years. Although the long-term durability of these off-therapy remissions is unknown, the results
suggest that a subset of patients with prolonged CMR
may be ‘‘cured.’’ If so, then the more potent BCR-ABL
inhibitors, coupled with careful molecular monitoring,
may play increasingly important roles in the management
of CML. However, the unclear, long-term advantages of
dasatinib and nilotinib over imatinib and the future
generic status of imatinib complicate this scenario. Careful studies of these issues should both improve the care of
CML patients and build the framework of targeted therapeutic approaches for other malignancies.
