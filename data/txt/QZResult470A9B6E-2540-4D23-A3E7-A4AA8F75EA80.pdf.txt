ABSTRACT
Objective: We investigated the role of 18F-fluorocholine positron emission
tomography/computed tomography (FCH-PET/CT) in the early evaluation of
abiraterone and outcome prediction in patients with metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC).
Patient and methods: Forty-three patients with metastatic CRPC progressing
after docetaxel received abiraterone 1,000 mg daily with prednisone 5 mg twice daily.
Patients were evaluated monthly for serological PSA response and safety. FCH-PET/
CT was done at baseline and after 3 to 6 weeks. Univariate and multivariate Cox
regression models addressed potential predictors of progression-free survival (PFS)
and overall survival (OS).
Results: Declines in PSA level of ≥50% were seen in 21 of 43 (49%) patients.
Forty-two patients were evaluable for FCH-PET/CT response. FCH-PET/CT bone
flare was observed in 4 of 42 (10%) evaluable patients. In univariate analysis, PSA
decline and FCH-PET/CT response predicted PFS, while PSA decline and FCH-PET/CT
(progression vs non progression) predicted OS. In multivariate analysis, only
FCH-PET/CT (progression vs nonprogression) remained significant for PFS and OS
(p = 0.022 and p = 0.027, respectively).
Conclusion: Early FCH-PET/CT can predict clinical outcome in CRPC beyond
PSA response. These data support further studies on FCH-PET/CT for abiraterone
monitoring and outcome prediction in patients with CRPC.

with agents that have the potential for PSA modulation
such as abiraterone, a selective inhibitor of androgen
biosynthesis that potently and irreversibly blocks
cytochrome P-450c17 (CYP17), which improved
survival in metastatic CRPC [1–3]. Consequently,
changes in radiological images have been advocated as
important markers of disease response and progression
to abiraterone [4, 5].

INTRODUCTION
A well-recognized barrier to therapy management
in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the lack
of reliable surrogate markers of response to treatment
coupled with a potentially exaggerated reliance on
changes in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as an
indicator of treatment efficacy. This is particularly true

Altered choline metabolism is a characteristic of
prostate cancer, and 18F-fluorocholine Positron emission
tomography (PET) - computed tomography (CT) (FCHPET/CT) is one of the most promising tools for prostate
cancer imaging [6]. FCH-PET/CT has been shown to have
a higher sensitivity and specificity than standard 99m
Tc-MDP bone scans and 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)PET/CT for the detection of bone metastases from CRPC
[7–9]. On the basis of these characteristics, this metabolic
imaging might be considered for further evaluation for
guiding prostate cancer management [10–12].
We investigated the role of FCH-PET/CT in the
early treatment evaluation and outcome prediction in
patients with CRPC treated with abiraterone.

performed at baseline before starting abiraterone. At
baseline, all patients had evidence of metastatic CRPC at
FCH-PET/CT, 39 had bone metastases. Characteristics
of the 43 patients included are summarized in Table 1.
Therapy-related toxicity with treatment interruption
were pulmonary thromboembolism (n = 1), grade 3
hypertransaminasis (n = 1), cardiac heart failure (n = 1),
while no abiraterone-related therapy interruption were
infective diarrhea (n = 1) and renal failure (n = 1). Other
grade 1–2 reported side effects were: asthenia (n = 23, 53%),
anemia (n = 19, 44%), diarrhea (n = 7, 16%), nausea (n = 5,
12%), fluid retention (n = 2, 4%), hypertension n=1 (2%).

Relationship between PSA decline and therapy
response at FCH-PET/CT

RESULTS

Declines in PSA level of 50% or more were
observed in 21 of 43 (49%) patients. The CT response
at 3 months of follow-up was assessed in 42 patients,
while one case with renal dysfunction did not perform it.
3-month CT results were: complete response (n = 1, 2%),
partial response (n = 1, 2%), stable disease (n = 28, 67%),

PD (n = 12, 29%). Forty-two patients were evaluable
for FCH-PET/CT response after a median time between
baseline and follow-up FCH-PET/CT scanning of 40 days
(range, 19 to 69 days). One of 43 patients did not perform
the follow-up FCH-PET/CT due to rapid PD with clinical
deterioration and decline in performance status.
FCH-PET/CT scanning showed 3 CR, 11 PR, 6 SD,
and 22 PD, but in 6 of 12 pts with initial PD at FCH-PET/CT
a bone flare phenomenon was suspected due to a stable
disease at 3-month CT scan associated with a progressive
decline of PSA. In one case suspected for bone flare,
the PET scan was not repeated due to severe intestinal
infection with treatment interruption and following clinical
deterioration. In another patient who had a 3-month PSA
decline of 60% with SD at 3-month CT scan, the followup FCH-PET/CT scanning after 11 weeks confirmed PD
with rapidly increasing PSA levels. Thus, overall, bone
scan flare, as defined by the combination of PSA decline,
initial flare, and subsequent improvement or stability in
the following FCH-PET/CT scanning was observed in 4 of
42 (10%) evaluable patients and 4 of 24 (17%) responsive
cases. The clinical characteristics of these 4 cases were
not significantly different from the study population
as a whole, median age was 71 years (range, 57 to 78),
median PSA level at baseline was 15.5 ng/mL (range,
1.5–92.2), the maximal decline of PSA was 91%, 73%,
64% and 37%, respectively. The latter case who had a very
low baseline PSA level of 1.5 ng/mL and PSA decline to
0.9 ng/mL (37%, lower than the threshold of 50%) was also
considered to be of interest and is reported as bone flare.
A PSA flare, defined as an initial PSA increment followed
by a decline below the PSA baseline level, was reported in
one case of bone flare, but also in another patient without
bone flare. Of 4 patients with FCH-PET/CT bone flare,

3 had PD after 9, 11 and 13 months, respectively, while
one is continuously progression free after 22+ months.
A CR was achieved at follow-up FCH-PET/CT in 3 of
the 26 (12%) evaluable patients, and was associated
with undetectable PSA levels (< 0.03 ng/mL) in 1 case
after 5 months on abiraterone. Of 3 patients with nodal
disease only, one obtained a CR at first FCH-PET/CT
and 2 a PR with a mean SUVmax reduction of 55% and
70%, respectively. Figure 1 to 3 show examples of early
FCH-PET/CT effects of abiraterone, including an example
of bone flare.
Changes in PSA levels were concordant with the
FCH PET/CT response/non-response in 30 of 42 patients
(71%) (Table 2), and with the FCH-PET/CT progression/
non-progression in 34 of 42 (81%) (Table 3).
Figure 4 describes waterfall plots of maximal PSA
change and correlation with either follow-up FCH-PET/
CT and CT scan in 42 evaluable patients.

Ability to predict survival
In all 43 patients, the median PFS time was
7.0 months (95% CI: 5.4 – 11.0), while the median OS
time was 18.7 months (95% CI: 10.8 – …). At the time
of analysis, after a median follow-up time of 22 months,
13 patients (30%) were considered progression free,
whereas 17 (40%) patients had died. Patients with
nonprogression at FCH-PET/CT and without bone flare
had a median PFS of 12.8 months, while those with bone
flare had a PFS of 11.0 months (p = 0.769). Patients
with progression at FCH-PET/CT had a median PFS of
3.4 months, statistically different from PFS of those with
nonprogression at FCH-PET/CT without or with bone
flare (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0033, respectively).

radiotracer uptake indicative of extensive bone metastases. Treatment with abiraterone resulted in bone progression of FCH-PET/CT scans
at week 4 confirmed at week 16.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were
performed to assess the association between factors
of interest and PFS and OS. In univariate analysis,
PSA decline, FCH-PET/CT (SD/PD vs PR/CR)
and FCH-PET/CT (progression vs non progression)
predicted PFS, while PSA decline and FCH-PET/CT
(progression vs non progression) predicted OS (Table 4).
In multivariate analysis, only FCH-PET/CT (progression
vs nonprogression) remained significant for PFS and OS
(p  = 0.022 and p = 0.027, respectively) (Table 4).

PSA decline ≥50% concurred with the FCH-PET/
CT response/non-response in 71% of patients (Table 2),
and with the FCH-PET/CT progression/non-progression
in 22 out of 26 81% cases (Table 3). Moreover, in
univariate analysis, FCH-PET/CT (SD/PD vs PR/CR) and
FCH-PET/CT (progression vs non progression) predicted
PFS, whereas in multivariate analysis only FCH-PET/CT
(progression vs nonprogression) remained significant
for PFS and OS (p = 0.022 and p = 0.027, respectively)
(Table  4). However, a main limitation of this study
is represented by the criteria used for FCH-PET/CT
classification of response, based on fairly arbitrary thresholds
for change in SUV (as specified in EORTC guidelines).
In this regard the differentiation between responders and
non-responders results much less reliable than the
FCH-PET/CT progression/non-progression evaluation.
PET/CT progression/non-progression proved
capable of predicting outcome in patients with other
tumors, including bone metastases [13, 14]. As abiraterone
in CRPC is given continuously until progression, it is
essential to predict and monitor progression rather than
the response to treatment. PET/CT criteria for monitoring
tumor progression are simpler and more widely accepted

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
that used FCH-PET/CT for outcome prediction and
tumor monitoring in CRPC. The correlation between the
prognostic value of PSA and FCH-PET/CT response to
therapy suggests that PSA levels are linked to a tumor
metabolic activity. Furthermore, in multivariate analysis
FCH-PET/CT (progression vs nonprogression) was
superior to PSA with respect to PFS and OS prediction,
supporting the hypothesis of an essential role of
FCH-PET/CT to improve therapy management.

than those for monitoring tumor response. The relationship
of PSA kinetics to radiological PFS has been recently
evaluated in an exploratory analysis of patients treated
with abiraterone in a randomized phase III study [15].
Radiological PFS was positively associated with the
magnitude of PSA decline, and the effect remained after
correcting for covariates. However, in this trial the PSA
level was monitored every 2–3 months, whereas the
kinetics of serum PSA analyzed monthly during the first
few months of abiraterone is associated with PSA flare in
nearly 10% of these patients, which could impair the early
evaluation of PSA response [16], The impact of FCHPET/CT could be even more relevant for CRPC with no
reliable serum biomarker, as is the case of bulky metastatic
disease with low serum PSA levels. However, in a few of
these cases, elevated circulating Chromogranin A levels
have been reported as possible expression of a CRPC
with neuroendocrine differentiation in which the role of
FCH-PET/CT is not known [17, 18]. Thus, the integrated
use of PSA and FCH-PET/CT could potentially lead to a
significant improvement in outcome prediction and in the
therapeutic monitoring of CRPC patients.
Clinical studies have demonstrated that PET can
predict response to chemotherapy and targeted therapy

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in cases of several tumors [14, 19–21]. The early
identification of therapeutic response supports the clinician
in the decision making. Moreover, new functional imaging
techniques such as whole-body diffusion weighted
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can improve the
evaluation of therapy response in patients with metastatic
bone disease with a potential significant impact in the
therapy assessments of patients with prostate cancer
because of the high prevalence of bone-only disease
[23, 24].
Controversy still exists on the applicability
of PET/CT and other new imaging tools in clinical
practice, mainly because of its expense. However apart
from additional costs related to PET/CT examinations,
potential savings associated with PET/CT as a result of
avoiding additional imaging examinations and by helping
clinicians make the optimum treatment decisions avoiding
that multiple doses of high-cost antineoplastic agents
are administered, even if they are ineffective. Thus, the
potential implementation in clinical practice of FCH-PET/
CT as well as predictor of clinical outcome needs further
evaluation and validation with larger patient population
including cost-benefit analyses. Additionally alternative
imagines such as whole-body diffusion weighted magnetic

MRI should be also evaluated in the same contest and for
the same purpose.
An important observation that emerges from our
study is the evidence of the mismatch highlighted in
4 patients between the reduction of the value of serum
PSA and the detection of an increased uptake of bone
lesions shown in the PET/CT after 1–2 months. This
mismatch was evaluated as related to the phenomena of
"bone flare", already reported in patients after treatment
with abiraterone in chemotherapy-naive CRPC who had
undergone bone scintigraphy, but that stands out for
the first time also with FCH-PET/CT [25]. FCH-PET/
CT bone flare predicted a favorable long-term outcome
similar to that of FCH-PET/CT non progressive patients.
The PCWG2 consensus criteria considered bone flare and
included the recommendation to perform a first follow-up
bone scan 12 or more weeks after the start of treatment,
and furthermore defines progression in bone when a
minimum of 2 new lesions are observed and confirmed on
a second scan done 6 or more weeks later [5].
The metabolic tumor changes as detected with
FCH-PET/CT make possible new ways of managing
and investigating CRPC. However, the early FCH-PET/
CT bone flare phenomenon should be considered as a

limitation ofits utility as an early indicator marker ,or thefirst
follow-up FCH-PET/CT should be carried out 3 months
after the start of therapy. Moreover, FCH uptake may be
influenced by several factors, including the number of
viable cells per unit volume, the tumor vascular supply, the
sites of metastases and the neuroendocrine differentiation
[17,  18,  26, 27]. Recently, new PET tracers such as
radiolabeled dihydrotestosterone and radiolabeled antibody
to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have
shown great potential for assessing patients’ early biologic
response to hormonal therapies in prostate cancer [28–30].
In conclusion, in this pilot study early FCH-PET/
CT was able to predict clinical outcome in CRPC beyond
PSA response. Further larger studies are needed to better
define the most sensitive and cost-effective modality for
assessment of therapy efficacy in CRPC.

received docetaxel and not more than two chemotherapy
regimens for metastatic CRPC. Prior ketoconazole therapy
was not permitted. Additional eligibility criteria included
adequate performance status, cardiac, renal, hepatic and
bone marrow function, serum potassium level 3.5 mmol/L
or more, and ongoing androgen deprivation with serum
testosterone <50 ng/dL. The protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients.

FCH-PET/CT scans were performed on an
integrated PET/CT system (Discovery Discovery  LS
camera, General Electric Medical Systems, Waukesha,
WI) in 2D acquisition mode for 3 minutes per bed
position. PET scanning was performed 45 minutes after
intravenous injection of 18F-Methilcholine (3,7 MBq/Kg
of body weight, AAA-Advanced Application Accellerator,
Meldola, Italy). The field of view included the skull to
mid- femurs. Low dose CT (120 kV, 80 mA) without
contrast agents was performed for attenuation correction
and as an anatomical map. The emission data were
corrected for scatter, random coincidence events, and
system dead time using the provided software.

Treatment and evaluation
Treatment consisted of abiraterone acetate
1,000 mg daily with prednisone 5 mg twice daily in
28-day cycles. Treatment was given continuously
until there was evidence of progressive disease (PD)
or unacceptable toxicity. PD was defined according to
Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria [5].
Baseline examinations included PSA, CT and
FCH-PET/CT scanning. Patients were evaluated
monthly for serological PSA response and safety.
FCH-PET/CT was repeated after 3 to 6 weeks. A CT
scan was done after 3 months of abiraterone therapy.
Adverse events were graded using the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.

aid the visual analysis [31]. Images were read sequentially
by using a Xeleris III workstation (General Electric
Medical Systems). PET, CT, and PET/CT fused images
were used to correctly evaluate the scans in various cuts
(axial, sagittal, and coronal)

responders were the patients with similar or higher FCH
uptake in the target lesions, and/or with a substantial
increase of the target lesions size (ie, 20% increase in
sums of longest diameters) [33]. Among nonresponders,
increased FCH uptake in a target lesion that was also
enlarged on CT imaging (ie, 20% increase in the longest
diameter) and/or a new metabolically active lesion were
considered indicative of progressive disease (PD), whereas
a substantially unchanged FCH uptake without substantial
increase in size was considered stable disease (SD).
In the statistical analysis of survival, we considered
FCH-PET/CT responders (CR/PR) versus nonresponders
(SD/PD), and progressing (PD) versus non-progressing
disease (CR/PR/SD).

Measurement of treatment effect by FCH-PET/CT
Baseline FCH-PET/CT was performed in all
patients and a minimum of 2 target lesions were
defined as a references. Patients scanned 3–6 weeks
after abiraterone therapy first cycle, were considered
responders according to guidelines for PET on the basis
of a metabolic activity decrease more than 25% of target
lesions depicted at baseline images, coupled with or
without evidence of change/decrease in size [32, 33]. A
complete disappearance of FCH uptake was considered
indicative of a metabolic complete response (CR), whereas
less than 100% but more than 25% of FCH uptake was
considered a metabolic partial remission (PR). Non-

occurred in the context of a ≥50% decline in PSA and
no evidence of PD at 3-month CT scan, with FCH-PET/
CT repeated 2–3 months later showing improvement or
stability. An initial PET scan flare followed by continued
declines in PSA levels below the threshold of 50%
and stable uptake at the third FCH PET-TC was also
considered to be of clinical interest.

Conflict of interest statement
Ugo De Giorgi and Vincenza Conteduca received
speaker honorarium from Janssen-Cilag.

Statistical analysis
PFS was defined as the time elapsed between the date
of the start of abiraterone and the date of PD or death or the
date of the last follow-up visit [5]. OS was defined as the
elapsed time between the date of the start of abiraterone and
the date of either death or the last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier
survival plots were generated on the basis of FCH-PET/CT
response, and the curves were compared using log-rank test.
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine
univariate and multivariate hazard ratios for selected
potential predictors of PFS and OS. A p value of < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
