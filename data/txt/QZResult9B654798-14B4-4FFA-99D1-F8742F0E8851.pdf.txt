BACKGROUND: This study was designed to assess the activity and safety of dose-adjusted infusional cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy with rituximab (DA-POCH-R) in elderly patients with
poor-prognostic untreated diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL). METHODS: From April 2006 to November 2009, 23 patients, aged 70 years, with an age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI) of 2 or 3, were
enrolled. Only patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 50% were allowed. The DA-POCH-R regimen
was administered every 3 weeks for a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 8 cycles. RESULTS: Median patient age was
77 years (range, 70-90 years); 83% of patients had Ann Arbor stage III to IV disease. Median LVEF at baseline was
62%. Four (17%) patients had a history of abnormal cardiovascular conditions. Twenty-one (91%) patients were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 90%, with a complete response rate of 57%. The 3-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 56% and 54%, respectively. Neutropenia (48%) was the most frequent grade
3 to 4 adverse event (AE); no grade 3 to 4 cardiac AEs were observed. CONCLUSIONS: DA-POCH-R was an active
and safe combination therapy for patients aged 70 years with poor-prognostic untreated DLBCL. This regimen was
a reasonable alternative for elderly patients who were not considered to tolerate standard R-CHOP treatment. Cancer

The reported incidence of diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (DLBCLs) has doubled in recent decades, and

this increase has been predominantly observed in older patients.1 Age greater than 60 has been identified as one of the
strongest adverse prognostic factor of DLBCL.2,3 Among lymphoma patients 60 years of age or older, patients 70 years
have a reduced failure-free and overall survival compared with younger patients and very elderly patients (80 years old)
frequently have comorbid conditions and are generally excluded from clinical trials or even from treatment.4 Some analyses have shown inferior survival in elderly patients to be a result of increased deaths from cardiovascular disease and other
nonrecurrence causes.5 Higher treatment-related mortality has also been reported in older patients using the CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) regimen,6,7 and several recent studies have shown that anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity is more frequent in this group of patients.8,9 These findings have often led to arbitrary dose
reductions or use of less-aggressive therapy, which may reduce the possibility of cure.
In vitro studies have shown that tumor cells had relatively less resistance with prolonged low-concentration exposure
to the natural-product-derived agents vincristine and doxorubicin than with brief higher-concentration exposure,10 and

decreasing peak plasma levels of doxorubicin by continuous infusion has shown to reduce cardiotoxicity with no
antitumor activity reduction.11 In a prospective phase II
study of infusional etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin (EPOCH regimen) in recurrent and resistant lymphomas, no clinically significant cardiac toxicity was
observed, despite that 94% of patients had previously
received an anthracycline-containing regimen.12 However, pharmacokinetic analyses of long-term continuousinfusion doxorubicin have shown, particularly for older
patients, significant interpatient variations in steady-state
plasma concentrations and have suggested an individual
patient dose adjustment based on hematopoietic nadir.13,14 Dynamic dose adjustment of the EPOCH regimen (DA-EPOCH) has resulted in dose escalations,
limited hematopoietic toxicity, and no cardiac complications or treatment-related deaths, even in patients with
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) -related
lymphoma.15-18
The addition of rituximab (monoclonal anti-CD20
antibody) to the conventional CHOP regimen (RCHOP) has been reported to increase the likelihood of
response and long-term event-free survival, with no overlapping toxicity, in elderly patients with poor-prognosis
DLBCL.19 The objective of this study was to assess efficacy and safety, with special attention to hematological
and cardiac toxicity, of the combination of rituximab and
dose-adjusted infusional CHOP chemotherapy (DAPOCH-R) for patients with poor-prognostic untreated
DLBCL aged >70 years and over. Unlike DA-EPOCH
plus rituximab regimen (DA-EPOCH-R),16,17 infusional
etoposide was not included in the study treatment schema
to maintain the same drug combination of standard RCHOP therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Signed, written informed consent was obtained
from each patient.
Patients’ Selection and Evaluation
Patients eligible for the study had previously untreated
DLBCL, according to the World Health Organization
classification of lymphoid neoplasms,20 were aged 70
years and over, and had at least 2 adverse prognostic factors as defined by the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.2 Patients
were also required to have adequate organ function as

infection or cardiac disease, white blood cell count 3.5
 109/L and platelet count 100  109/L unless caused
by lymphoma infiltration of marrow or spleen. Exclusion
criteria included the following: a recent history of other
malignant disease except for nonmelanoma skin cancer or
carcinoma in situ of the cervix, prior radiotherapy or
chemotherapy, history of indolent lymphoma, central
nervous system involvement at diagnosis and seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus. Staging procedures included clinical examination; computerized
tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen, pelvis (and neck if
indicated); blood count and clinical chemistry; bone marrow biopsy; and echocardiography, with evaluation of
LVEF.
Therapy and Dose Adjustments
The immunochemotherapy program (DA-POCH-R)
consisted of rituximab (375 mg/m2) on Day 1, followed
immediately by DA-POCH. The DA-POCH starting
dose level consisted of doxorubicin 10 mg/m2/d as a continuous intravenous (iv) infusion on Days 1-4, vincristine
0.4 mg/d as a continuous iv infusion on Days 1 to 4, cyclophosphamide 375 mg/m2 iv on Day 1 and prednisone
60 mg/m2/d orally on Days 1 to 5. All patients received
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim
5 lg/kg/d) beginning on Day 6 and continued until the
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) exceed the nadir >0.5
 109/L. Erythropoietin treatment for anemia was also
permitted at the treating physician’s discretion. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim double strength was administered twice daily for 3 days per week. The cycles were
repeated every 3 weeks, and patients received 2 cycles
beyond complete response (CR) for a minimum of 6 and
a maximum of 8 cycles. At the end of study treatment,
radiotherapy (30 Gray [Gy]) was planned to sites of prior
bulky disease at diagnosis.
Dose adjustments above the starting dose level
applied to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (Table 1).
The adjustment paradigm was based on the ANC nadir in
the previous cycle and was designed to achieve a shallow
period of neutropenia.14 If a platelet nadir value below 25
 109/L was observed, doses were reduced only 20%,
regardless of the ANC nadir. The adjustment paradigm
was based specifically on twice-weekly complete blood
counts obtained 3 days apart, such as Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.

Vincristine was administered at a fixed dose of 1.6
mg (0.4 mg per day). The vincristine dose was reduced
25% if grade 2 motor neuropathy developed, 50% for
grade 3 motor neuropathy, and 50% for grade 3 sensory
neuropathy. The dose of vincristine was increased up to a
full dose if the toxic effect for which it had been reduced
lessened.
Infusions were administered through a central venous access. Patients usually received their 96-hour infusions by using a single portable infusion pump. A 48-hour
supply of vincristine and doxorubicin mixed in 500 mL
0.9% normal saline was prepared every 2 days.
Evaluation of Response
All patients were reevaluated using a CT scan after 4 cycles
of chemotherapy and at the end of treatment. Bone marrow biopsy was repeated at the end of treatment for those
patients with lymphomatous infiltration on entry into the
trial. CT scans were programmed every 6 months for the
first 2 years of follow-up and then at the treating physician’s discretion. 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) was carried out
in the presence of residual measurable disease at the end of
immunochemotherapy, and at the end of treatment to
prove a complete remission. Tumor responses were classified according to the International Workshop criteria.21
Toxicity and Feasibility Evaluation
Toxicity of therapy was calculated over a total of 130
cycles, while feasibility was calculated over a total of 107
cycles, as the first cycles of therapy, which were not susceptible to delay or dose reduction because of toxicity,

were not considered. The limiting hematological values
for recycling were as follows: ANC <1.5  109/L and/or
platelet count <100  109/L. LVEF was to be evaluated
by ECHO scan at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after
therapy initiation. The actual dose intensity (ADI) for
each agent of the DA-POCH-R combination was calculated according to the method of Hryniuk and Bush.22
Relative dose intensity (RDI) for each drug was defined as
the ratio between the ADI delivered for each drug and the
planned dose intensity of the first DA-POCH-R cycle.
Hematologic and extrahematologic toxicities were scored
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC), version 3.0.23 Severe
adverse events (AEs) were defined by the occurrence of a
documented infection and/or by organ or system toxicity
requiring hospitalization.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoints of this prospective, single-arm,
observational study were response to therapy and toxicity.
The Gehan 2-stage design was used for estimating the
response rate.24 The sample size calculation was based on
the double requirement of being able to stop the study
early if the response rate was lower than 20% and of estimating the response rate with a standard error of <0.1,
with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 95%. After the first
stage comprising 14 patients had been completed, safety
and efficacy were assessed. As the response rate was much
higher than anticipated at this point, the trial was closed after 23 patients were enrolled as the unacceptable response
rate of below 20% had already been ruled out even if the
trial continued to the target sample size of 25 patients. Secondary endpoints investigated were feasibility (defined as
the proportion of patients who completed all planned therapy) and survival. Event-free survival (EFS) was measured
from the start of treatment to the first adverse event (ie, disease progression, recurrence, diagnosis of a secondary
malignancy, institution of a new and unplanned anticancer
treatment, treatment-related death without progression or
progression after PR) or to the last follow-up at which the
patient was known to be alive. Overall survival (OS) was
measured from the start of treatment to the date of death
or the last follow-up at which the patient was known to be
alive. EFS and OS were estimated according to the KaplanMeier method.25 All efficacy and toxicity endpoints were
updated in December 2009.
Factors that were assessed for their influence on the
CR rate and EFS included age (80 vs >80), gender, performance status, presence of B symptoms, presence of

log rank test26 was used to evaluate prognostic factors for
EFS in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression
model.27 The influence of prognostic factors on the
response rate was examined by Fisher exact test.28 The
logistic model29 was used in a multivariate analysis of CR.
All reported P values are 2-sided; P values of.05 or less

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
From April 2006 to November 2009, 23 patients were enrolled into this study. Two patients were prematurely
removed from the study by their attending physicians after
receiving only 1 cycle with no documented evidence of disease progression. Thus, 21 patients (91%) could be eval-

uated for response. All patients were included in the analysis
of survival outcomes, feasibility, and toxicity. Table 2 shows
selected characteristics and pretreatment details of study
patients. The median age of the patients was 77 years (range,
70-90 years). The majority of the patients were in stage III
and IV and one-quarter had bulky disease at presentation.
Two patients were hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive before
the initiation of DA-POCH-R, but they had mild or no
signs or symptoms (grade 0 and 1) of HCV infection except
for a positive serological test. The HCV RNA was not
titrated, and none of these 2 HCV-positive patients received
a specific antiviral treatment during the immunochemotherapy program. In addition, 4 patients had preexisting
cardiac disease with a preserved contractility on echocardiography. These 4 patients did not receive any cardioprotective agent during DA-POCH-R administration.
Response to Treatment
Based on an intent-to-treat analysis, the overall response
rate (ORR) for the 23 treated patients was 83% (95%
confidence interval [CI], 68%-98%) (Table 3). Twelve
(52%) patients achieved CR, and 7 (30%) patients
achieved PR. When only the 21 evaluable patients were
analyzed, the overall response rate was 90% (95% CI,
77%-100%). Consolidation radiotherapy was administered to all 6 patients with bulky disease, whereas 1 patient
was given radiotherapy to PET-positive residual disease.
Notably, all patients who had achieved CR were still alive
and free of disease after a median observation time of 17
months from entry of remission.
Feasibility
Overall, 21 (91%) patients completed treatment. Of the
107 cycles considered, 62 (58%) were delivered on time,
at the planned dose. Most patients required dose escalations to achieve an ANC nadir, with 43 (40%) cycles having at least 144% of the entry-dose level. Nine (43%)
patients required chemotherapy dose reduction. Therapy
delays were made for 7 (33%) patients on 13 (12%)
cycles. Table 4 shows average ADI and RDI for each chemotherapeutic agent of the DA-POCH-R regimen in all
the treated patients. The planned dose of rituximab was
delivered in 100% of cycles. Patients aged 80 years
required higher dose rates than older patients to achieve
the targeted ANC nadir (P ¼ .05).

criteria. One hundred thirty cycles were evaluated. The
median number of cycles administered per patient was 6
(range, 1-8). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Grade
3 to 4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia
occurred in 13%, 48%, and 9% of patients, respectively.
Patients older than 80 years showed a significantly (P
<.001) higher rate of grades 3 and 4 neutropenia (38% of
cycles) compared with younger patients (19% of cycles).
The median duration of grade 4 neutropenia was 3 days
(range, 2-5 days). The ANC nadir was invariably observed
around Day 8 to 12 of treatment. Most important, the
clinical effect of these hematologic toxicities was limited,
with no cases of hemorrhage and only 8 (6%) cycles were
complicated by neutropenic fever occurring in 3 (13%)
patients. Five (22%) patients received erythropoietin support during the study. In total, 4 (17%) patients required
blood product support during treatment with a median of
2 units of red cells (range, 1-5 units) and 1 unit of platelets
transfused.
Severe nonhematologic toxicities were registered in 3
(2%) cycles. These severe adverse events consisted of oral
mucositis in 1 (4%) patient and diarrhea in 1 patient. The
liver toxicity of DA-POCH-R in the 2 patients with HCV
infection was low, although 1 of these experienced a mild
and transient increase of liver enzymes levels (grade 1).
Pretreatment cardiovascular risk factors of study
patients are shown in Table 2. No grade 3 or 4 cardiac
events were observed after DA-POCH-R therapy initiation. Four (17%) patients had a decrease in the ejection
fraction of 10% or more from baseline. However, none of
these patients had LVEF levels of less than 50% at any
time, and all of these experienced LVEF recovery to
baseline levels after completion of study treatment.
Mean LVEF values measured at predefined time
points are shown in Figure 1. No statistical differences
between mean pre- and posttreatment LVEF values were
observed.

in all patients was progressive lymphoma. The median OS
and EFS have not been reached with a survival probability
at 3 years of 56% (95% CI, 40%-80%). Figure 2 shows

reductions vs 3 [33%] of 9 patients with dose reductions;
P ¼ .02). A logistic regression model revealed that chemotherapy dose reduction was the only independent predictive factor for poor response to DA-POCH-R (odds ratio,
6.2; 95% CI, 1.5-80; P ¼ .04).
Among the multiple variables evaluated by univariate
analysis for their possible correlation with outcome, age
>80 years (Fig. 2B), and chemotherapy dose reduction
were shown to have adverse prognostic value for EFS; the
latter variable maintained its adverse prognostic value for
EFS after multivariate analysis (hazards ratio, 36; 95% CI,
3-150; P ¼ .005).

DISCUSSION
The results of our current prospective phase II trial demonstrated that the combination of rituximab and doseadjusted infusional CHOP (DA-POCH-R) is both feasible and effective in patients aged 70 years with poorprognostic untreated DLBCL. This regimen produced an
ORR of 83% (90% for the evaluable population) with
favorable hematologic and cardiac safety profiles.
The R-CHOP regimen was recognized as gold standard treatment for elderly patients (60 years) with
DLBCL.18,30 However, the median age of patients enrolled
in the R-CHOP phase III registration trial (GELA study)
was only 69 years, and patients aged >80 years were not
included in the trial.18 Other reports showed that nonHodgkin lymphoma patients 70 years are more prone to
encounter serious adverse events with R-CHOP than
younger patients.31 In a retrospective series of 24 DLBCL
patients more than 80 years old who received standard RCHOP treatment, dose reductions of doxorubicin were
mandatory in 92% of study patients, with a median RDI of
63%.32 New protocols specifically tailored to the tolerance
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients were reported to proCancer

duce functional lymphoma therapy in the elderly (Table
6). All of these regimens were characterized by a shorter duration and by the use of doxorubicin-free protocols to
reduce the incidence of treatment-related adverse events,
mainly myeloid and cardiac toxicity.33-39 Among these
adapted regimens, R-VNCOP-B (etoposide, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, and
bleomycin plus rituximab) is a doxorubicin-free combination therapy containing mitoxantrone, an anthracycline
supposed to display reduced cardiotoxicity.31,33,40 Despite
the favorable outcome reported, grade 3 to 4 neutropenia
was observed in 75% to 83%, with febrile neutropenia
occurring in 30% of cases.31 The use of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin was also tested with encouraging results
in patients with DLBCL and with concurrent cardiac disease or pretreated with anthracyclines,41 in frail patients
with DLBCL,42 and in patients with AIDS-related nonHodgkin lymphoma.43 In a series of untreated DLBCL
patients aged over 60 years,44 substitution of the nonpegylated liposomal doxorubicin, MyocetTM, for doxorubicin

in the standard R-CHOP showed similar efficacy (Table
6). Twenty-one percent of these patients experienced cardiac adverse events, graded as 3 to 4 in 4% of the cases.
Our treatment schema was derived from the DAEPOCH-R regimen,16,17 with modest modifications.
Etoposide was omitted and, in view of an outpatient care
program, cyclophosphamide was administered on Day 1
together with rituximab to deliver both the noncontinuously infused drugs on the same day of each cycle. Our
data confirm efficacy and safety of dynamic dose adjustment of infusional doxorubicin in DLBCL patients, providing additional support for results already published
with DA-EPOCH-R,15-18 albeit not specifically restricted
to elderly population (Table 6).

In our study, the CR rate and the 3-year OS and EFS
rates were 57%, 56%, and 54%, respectively. These results
appear to be superimposable on previously reported findings for other age-adapted R-CHOP regimens.32 Moreover,
the estimated 3-year OS achieved with DA-POCH-R compares favorably with 62% 3-year OS achieved with RCHOP in the GELA trial.18 Our results for the DAPOCH-R regimen can also be considered promising if we
take into account the fact that our patients had a median
age of 77 years, ranging from 70 to 90, which is higher than
all others trials that investigated chemotherapy regimens in
elderly patients with DLBCL.31,44
The DA-POCH-R treatment was found to be feasible and well tolerated, even in patients who had either a
very advanced age (>80 years) or comorbidities. As
expected, the most frequent grade 3 to 4 AEs were neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, which occurred in 48%
and 13% of patients, respectively. However, the observed
rates of AEs with DA-POCH-R did not differ from those
reported in other dose-adjusted regimens14-17 and were
substantially lower than AE rates observed in a series of
doxorubicin-free protocols31-40,42,44 specifically tailored
for elderly patients with DLBCL (Table 6).
One of the most important objectives of the present
study was to assess the cardiac toxicity associated with DAPOCH-R. Overall, a 17% rate of cardiac events of any
grade was reported, but no grade 3 to 4 events were
observed. Of interest, DA-POCH-R did not result in a significant change in the LVEF from baseline to final assessment. The rate of cardiac toxicity recorded in our study is
also among the lowest recorded when compared with results
of other trials investigating R-CHOP, or R-CHOP-like regimens, in elderly patients with DLBCL.18,30-32,44
In our study, multivariate analysis revealed that the
need for chemotherapy dose reduction was the only predictive factor of poor outcome, independently of age.
Back in the days of first-generation chemotherapeutic regimens, when in a Southwest Oncology group (SWOG)
study CHOP chemotherapy was reduced by 50% in
patients over 65 years of age, CR rates declined.45 However, in a small subset of patients over 65 years of age who
received full doses, the CR rate approximated that of
younger patients. Fisher et al46 subsequently indicated
that, at full dosage, the percentage of toxic deaths with
CHOP increased, while the CR rate decreased when the
doses were reduced. Our data suggest that using a doseadjusted CHOP schedule in elderly patients with DBCL
could be a reasonable option for avoiding dose-dependent
reduction in treatment efficacy. The 3-year OS of 56% in

our study population was much higher than the 30%

considered as optimal by the authors in only 17% of the
cases.47
Results from this study should be considered in
light of some limitations. It was a single center, uncontrolled study of a relatively small number of patients.
The median follow-up was relatively short at only 22
months, although it was a reasonable period to evaluate
EFS and OS for poor prognosis DLBCL. The improved
outcome relative to recent approaches may be due to
selection bias; however, this issue was decreased through
the use of the standardized age-adjusted IPI as an eligibility criterion.
In conclusion, the combination of rituximab and
dose-adjusted infusional CHOP (DA-POCH-R) was
well tolerated and showed promising efficacy in patients
aged 70 years with poor-prognostic untreated DLBCL.
DA-POCH-R could be another option for elderly
patients who are not considered to tolerate standard RCHOP; this scheme, therefore, warrants further evaluation in randomized studies against other age-adapted,
anthracycline-based regimens. The administration of

DA-POCH-R as an outpatient regimen by using a single
portable infusion pump may be a feasible alternative to
improve the compliance and to reduce the total cost of
this both reliable and manageable regimen.
