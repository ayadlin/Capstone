ABSTRACT
Tylophorine compounds have been the focus of drug development for decades.
Tylophorine derivatives exhibit anti-cancer activities but their cellular targets
remain unknown. We used a biotinylated tylophorine derivative to probe for the
interacting cellular target(s) of tylophorine. Tylophorine directly binds to caprin-1
and consequently enhances the recruitment of G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, and cyclin D2
mRNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex. Subsequently, this tylophorine targeted
ribonucleoprotein complex is sequestered to the polysomal fractions and the protein
expressions of the associated mRNA-transcripts are repressed. Caprin-1 depleted
carcinoma cells become more resistant to tylophorine, associated with decreased
formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex targeted by tylophorine. Consequently,
tylophorine downregulates c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2, causing hypophosphorylation
of Rb and suppression of both processing-body formation and the Warburg effect.
Gene expression profiling and gain-of-c-Myc-function experiments also revealed that
the downregulated c-Myc contributes to the anti-oncogenic effects of tylophorine
compounds. Furthermore, the potent tylophorine derivative dibenzoquinoline-33b
elicited a similar effect, as c-Myc protein levels were also decreased in xenograft
tumors treated with dibenzoquinoline-33b. Thus, tylophorine compounds exert anticancer activity predominantly by targeting and sequestering the caprin-1 protein and
c-Myc mRNA associated ribonucleoprotein complex.

INTRODUCTION

recruiting miRNA let-7-loaded RISC (RNA miRNAinduced silencing complex) to the c-Myc 3’UTR [6]. This
raises the possibility of developing c-Myc inhibitors by
targeting its associated RNP.
Cyclin D (cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3
encoded in human cells) is a member of the cyclin protein
family. These proteins are involved in the regulation of
cell cycle progression for the transition of G1 to S phase
[7]. c-Myc has been shown to regulate transcription of
genes involved in cell cycle including cyclin D[1]. The

c-Myc is a transcriptional factor that regulates a
variety of cellular processes including the activity of
cyclin D-Cdk (cyclin-dependent kinase) [1], the Warburg
effect in cancer cell metabolism[2, 3], and cellular mRNP
processing[4, 5]. Myc expression is deregulated in a wide
range of human cancers and is therefore a therapeutic
target. Recently, it was found that the RNA-binding
protein human antigen R inhibits c-Myc expression by

retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) is one
of the best known substrates of active cyclin D-Cdk4/6
complexes. Thus, the phosphorylated pRb is a common
downstream effector of cyclins D1[8, 9], D2[10, 11], and
c-Myc[1, 7].
The tumor suppressor protein pRb is dysregulated
in several major cancers. pRb is a stable protein and
is phosphorylated by several Cdks, which downregulates its activity. Active pRb acts as a tumor
suppressor by inhibiting cell cycle progression[7]. In
the hypophosphorylated active form, pRb sequesters the
transcriptional factor E2F. When pRb is inactivated by
hyperphosphorylation, it releases E2F, permitting E2F to
execute its cell cycle regulatory functions. Therefore, the
hyperphosphorylation of pRb during late G1 phase enables
the activation of E2F-dependent transcription, e.g cyclin
A2[12].
Caprin-1(Cytoplasmic activation- and proliferationassociated protein 1) is ubiquitously expressed, and
its phosphorylation is required for normal cell cycle
progression from the G1 to S phase. Caprin-1 co-localizes
with G3BP1 (Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding
protein 1) within the cytoplasmic RNA granules that
are associated with microtubules. This caprin-1/G3BP1
complex is thought to regulate the transport and translation
of mRNAs whose protein products are involved in
proliferation and migration in multiple cell types because
the carboxyl-terminal region of caprin-1 selectively binds
to c-Myc or cyclin D2 mRNAs[13]. Collectively, the
caprin-1, G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, and Cyclin D2 mRNA
complex represents a function-specific RNP complex and
is required for important cellular events.
Natural products constitute a successful and
promising resource for drug discovery. The elucidation
of the cellular targets of therapeutic natural products not
only contributes to the identification of valuable novel
drug targets for future development, but also guides
subsequent molecular pharmacology and mode-of-action
studies[14, 16]. Tylophorine-related natural compounds,
which are found in the Asclepiadaceae and Moraceae plant
families, exhibit multiple biological activities (e.g., anticancer, anti-coronavirus, and anti-inflammatory activities)
[17-24]. Tylophorine compounds have been the focus of
drug development as therapeutic agents since the 1960s,
whereas tylocrebrine failed phase I clinical trials due to
neurotoxicity [17]. Although several modes of action for
anti-cancer tylophorine compounds have been reported[20,
25-28], their direct cellular target(s) and related pathways
remain to be elucidated[24]. In particular, the fundamental
mechanisms underlying the broad spectrum, drug-resistant
cancer cell inhibitory activities of tylophorine compounds
remain to be investigated.
We designed and synthesized a biotinylated
tylophorine compound which retained the molecular
targeting moiety, enabling the probing of direct cellular
target(s). In combination with proteomic approaches and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

further molecular mechanism studies, the anti-cancer
activities of the tylophorine compounds were elucidated.
Our results provide a mechanistic basis for developing the
tylophorine derived compounds into anti-cancer drugs.
The identified cellular target(s) of tylophorine represent
novel drug targets for anti-cancer therapeutic applications.

RESULTS
Synthesis of a biotinylated tylophorine analogue
Previously, we reported that the non-planar structure
between the two major phenanthrene and indolizidine/
quinolizidine moieties, as well as the planarity and
rigidity of the indolizidine/quinolizidine moiety of
tylophorine compounds, significantly affect the activities
of tylophorine analogues[19]. Recently, we successfully
synthesized potent tylophorine-derived dibenzoquinolines
that elicit the same biological functions as traditional
pentacyclic tylophorine compounds[23]. Therefore, we
concluded that the angular dibenzoquinoline moiety in
tylophorine compounds is responsible for the interactions
with their direct target molecule(s). Thus, we sought to
design and synthesize a biotinylated tylophorine-derived
dibenzoquinoline (Fig. 1A), referred to herein as the
“biotinylated tylophorine”, to probe direct interacting
molecules in cells. The biotinylated tylophorine retained
anti-cancer cell activity with IC50 values of ~13-30 µM
against HONE-1, MCF7, or NUGC-3 carcinoma cells (see
Supplemental Table 1).

Identification of direct targets of tylophorine
via pull-down experiments with biotinylated
tylophorine
HONE-1 cell lysates were incubated with the
vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO), biotin-XSSE, or biotinylated tylophorine prior to the addition
of streptavidin in a pull-down experiment. The pulleddown complex was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
silver staining to analyze the proteins that specifically
interacted with the biotinylated tylophorine. A total
of 6 protein bands were specifically associated with
biotinylated tylophorine compared to biotin-X-SSE (Fig.
1B); these bands were excised for further matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF)
mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics analyses. The
potential tylophorine-interacting proteins were identified
by Mascot data analysis (Fig. 1C and Supplemental Table
2), and the specific interaction of these proteins with
biotinylated tylophorine was validated by western blot
analysis (Fig. 1D). Caprin-1, α-actinin-4, nucleolin, the

(PABP-1), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M3M4 (hnRNPM3-M4), hnRNPQ, TATA-binding proteinassociated factor 2N isoform 1 (TAF-15), G3BP1, 40S
ribosomal protein S6 (S6), phosphorylated S6 (p-S6),
and ribosomal protein S3 were specifically pulled down
by biotinylated tylophorine compared to biotin-X-SSE
or DMSO, but the expression levels of these proteins in
tylophorine-treated HONE-1 or MCF7 carcinoma cells
were not significantly altered compared with DMSOtreated cells, with the exception of p-S6, which was
significantly increased (Fig. 1E).
The pull-down of ribosome proteins by biotinylated
tylophorine was not unexpected because tylocrebrine was
previously reported to inhibit the translocation of peptidyltRNA in ribosomes by 54%, although a tylocrebrine
concentration as high as 100 µM was used[29]. Because
tylophorine compounds exert significant anti-cancer
activities, generally with IC50 values ranging from
hundreds to a few nM[22-24], we further examined other
proteins identified to seek specific targets for anti-cancer.

Caprin-1 was identified among the molecules
that were pulled down by biotinylated tylophorine, and
we focused on this protein because it is ubiquitously
expressed and required for normal progression through the
G1-S phase[13]. We performed co-immunoprecipitation
using a caprin-1 antibody to assess the associated complex
members. We identified α-actinin-4, G3BP1, and p-S6
within the caprin-1 complex in the presence of biotinylated
tylophorine (Fig. 2A). Because caprin-1 and G3BP1 were
previously reported to associate and co-localize within
RNA-rich cytoplasmic granules[13], we further dissected
the association of c-Myc mRNA and cyclin D2 mRNA in
HONE-1 cells by RT-PCR analysis of the products from
the pull-down experiment with biotinylated tylophorine
(Fig. 2B). We also demonstrated the direct, but weak,
interaction of biotinylated tylophorine with caprin-1 in

another pull-down experiment using purified recombinant
caprin-1 protein (Fig. 2C).
Furthermore, sedimentation fractionation revealed
that caprin-1, G3BP1, p-S6, c-Myc mRNA, and cyclin
D2 mRNA co-localized within polysomal fractions upon
tylophorine treatment (Fig. 2D-a); this colocalization
did not occur in vehicle-treated HONE-1 cells (Fig. 2Db). Moreover, a low abundance of cyclin D2 has been
observed in certain carcinoma cell lines[30-32], such as
MCF7 (Fig. 3A); under certain conditions, the loss of a
specific cyclin can be compensated by the presence of
others [33, 34]. Further investigation revealed that cyclin

D1 mRNA co-localizes with the caprin-1, G3BP1, and
c-Myc mRNA-associated RNP complex (Fig. 2B), as well
as within polysomal fractions (Fig. 2D). These results
indicate that either cyclin D1 or D2 mRNAs might be
sequestered by biotinylated tylophorine (Fig. 2B & 2D)
or associated with a tylophorine-targeted RNP complex in
tylophorine-treated HONE-1 cells (Fig. 2D).

Tylophorine represses the protein expression of
c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2 but does not decrease
their mRNA levels through association with
caprin-1

(Fig. 3A). However, c-Myc and cyclin D1 protein levels
were diminished in HONE-1, MCF7, or NUGC-3 cells
upon tylophorine treatment (Fig. 3B). In addition, and
as expected, cyclin D2 protein levels were decreased in
tylophorine treated HONE-1 and NUGC-3 but no cyclin
D2 were detectable in MCF7 cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore,
we used TAMRA to label the newly synthesized
protein after tylophorine treatment and followed by
immunoprecipitation and western blot to detect the
proteins of interest. We found that the de novo protein
syntheses of c-Myc and cyclinD1/D2 were diminished
upon tylophorine treatment but not that of G3BP1
protein (Fig. 3C). When HONE-1 cells were depleted
with caprin-1 by siRNA, the resultant cells became more

We examined the effect of tylophorine on the
expression of c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2 based on the
above pull-down results. Tylophorine treatment increased
the mRNA levels of c-Myc and cyclin D1 in both HONE-1
and MCF7 cells. Cyclin D2 mRNA levels were increased
only in HONE-1 cells upon tylophorine treatment since
cyclin D2 mRNA level was undetectable in MCF7 cells
as reported [30-32], regardless of tylophorine treatment

with puromycin. The resultant cells were analyzed by western blotting for validation of caprin-1 depletion before subjected to measurement

resistant to tylophorine compounds with an ~2 fold higher
IC50 value for tylophorine and its potent derivative DBQ
33b (dibenzoquinoline-33b) (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, the
amounts of G3BP1 protein (Fig. 3E) and mRNAs of
c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2 pulled down by biotinylated
tylophorine were decreased (Fig. 3F).
These results suggest that tylophorine blocked the
protein expressions of c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2 through
association with caprin-1 thereby downregulating their
downstream signaling pathways to exert the anti-cancer
activity. The roles of tylophorine-downregulated signaling
pathways of c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2 in anti-cancerous
tylophorine were investigated as followed.

resumed the hyperphosphorylation of pRb through a
pathway independent of cyclins D1/D2.
In summary, active hypophosphorylated pRb can
be inactivated to hyperphosphorylated form upon the
overexpression of cyclins D1/D2 or c-Myc in tylophorinetreated carcinoma cells. The hypophosphorylation of pRb
plays an important role in facilitating the anti-cancer
activity of tylophorine. Accordingly, the downstream
pathway targets of c-Myc as well as those of cyclins D1
and D2 (e.g. pRb, cyclin A2 and cyclin B1) were also
downregulated and contributed to the anti-cancer activity
of tylophorine.

The effects of tylophorine treatment on cellular
events specifically regulated by c-Myc such as
the Warburg effect in cancer metabolism and
formation of processing bodies

Tylophorine hypophosphorylates and activates
pRb through repressing protein expression of
cyclins D1/D2 and c-Myc
pRb protein, a common downstream effector of
cyclins D1[8, 9] and D2[10, 11] and c-Myc[1, 7], was
further examined for tylophorine effects on the anticancer
activity. pRb was hypophosphorylated to the active form
in tylophorine-treated carcinoma cells, whereas its protein
expression levels remained unchanged (Fig. 3B); this
result was expected because the protein expressions of
the pRb’s upstream regulators, cyclins D1[8, 9]/ D2[10,
11] and c-Myc[1, 7], were reduced by tylophorine
treatment thereby decreasing the phosphorylation of pRb
(Fig. 3B). Cyclin A2 was downregulated by tylophorine,
which partially accounts for the G1 arrest induced by
tylophorine[20, 25]. The cyclin A2 promoter region
contains two E2F regulatory sites. When either cyclin D2
(Fig. 4A-upper panel) or cyclin D1 (Fig. 4A-lower panel)
was overexpressed, the downstream hyperphosphorylation
of pRb resumed, thereby upregulating E2F-mediated
cyclin A2 expression[35] in tylophorine-treated cells (Fig.
4A).
Moreover, ectopic overexpression of c-Myc also
restored the hyperphosphorylation of the downstream
effector pRb as well as cyclin A2 expression. Strikingly,
the expression of cyclins D1/D2 was not restored by
ectopic overexpression of c-Myc (Fig. 4B), even though
cyclins D1/D2 are downstream target genes of c-Myc
signaling [36, 37]. The resulting hyperphosphorylation of
pRb can be, at least in part, attributed to increased levels
of cyclin B1[38] (Fig. 4B), a c-Myc target and another
upstream effector of pRb, or feedback from upregulated
cyclin A2, as ectopic overexpression of cyclin A2 was
also able to partially resume the hyperphosphorylation of
pRb (Fig. 4C). These results further emphasize that even
ectopically expressed c-Myc can upregulate or stabilize
the transcription of cyclins D1 and D2, but their mRNA is
subject to sequestration by tylophorine in the caprin-1 and
c-Myc mRNA-associated RNP complex, thereby blocking
their translation. Therefore, ectopically expressed c-Myc

To demonstrate the functional consequences of
c-Myc signaling inhibition by tylophorine, cellular events
specifically regulated by c-Myc such as the Warburg effect
in cancer metabolism, and formation of processing bodies
(P-bodies), were examined.
Although most tylophorine-treated cells were
viable, their proliferation was completely suppressed[20],
and no significant apoptosis occurred[25]. Therefore,
we examined the effect of tylophorine treatment on
GLS1 (Glutaminase type 1)[3] and LDHA (Lactate
dehydrogenase)[2], c-Myc-targeted genes that mediate
the cancer cell nutrient supply via the Warburg effect, and
observed that the protein expression levels of these genes
were downregulated in tylophorine-treated carcinoma
cells (Fig. 5A and 5B). When c-Myc was overexpressed in
tylophorine-treated HONE-1 cells, the protein expression
levels of GLS1 and LDHA were restored (Fig. 5B).
Thus, tylophorine downregulated the Warburg effect by
suppressing c-Myc protein expression levels.
The levels of eIF4E [4, 5] (a c-Myc target gene)
which is involved in cytoplasmic mRNP processing,
were significantly reduced in carcinoma cells, as were
the levels of Dcp1a, another constituent of P-bodies
[39-41] (Fig. 5A). We next examined the effects of
tylophorine treatment on P-body formation using confocal
immunofluorescent microscopy, which indicated that both
the numbers of P-bodies and the populations of cells that
exhibited P-bodies were dramatically decreased to 0~5%
upon tylophorine treatment in HONE-1, NUGC-3, or
HeLa cells (Fig. 5C).

downstream pathway components such as pRb) (Fig. 7).
Because abnormal c-Myc signaling in cancer cells has
been associated with oncogenicity, the downregulation of
c-Myc by tylophorine compounds might play a significant
role in the anti-cancer activity of these compounds.
The therapeutic targeting of RNP complexes
represents an under-explored but emerging strategy for
drug discovery[42]. RNPs are ribonucleoproteins in
which RNA and protein molecules, such as the ribosome,
the enzyme telomerase, hnRNP, small nuclear RNPs
(snRNPs), and viral RNP complexes, interact. RNP
complexes exhibit multiple roles, dynamic conformations,
and chemical instability. Therefore, targeting RNPs for the
discovery or development of therapeutic agents remains
a challenge. However, several antiviral agents have been
reported to target viral RNP complexes with high potency
and exhibit significant potential for development into
therapeutic drugs [43-45]. To the best of our knowledge,
no anti-cancer agent targeting an RNP complex has been
reported. We are the first to report that targeting an RNP
complex (i.e., targeting the caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNAcontaining RNP complex by tylophorine compounds) in
carcinoma cells can efficiently elicit anti-cancer activity.
Significantly, pull-down experiments using
biotinylated tylophorine revealed the association of
caprin-1, G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, and cyclins D1/D2
mRNA in untreated carcinoma cell lysates (Fig. 1D and
2B) in which the mRNAs for c-Myc and cyclin D1 and D2
were not upregulated, as was observed in the tylophorinetreated carcinoma cells (Fig. 2D-a). However, we did
not observe the polysomal colocalization of G3BP1,
c-Myc mRNA, and cyclins D1/D2 mRNA with caprin-1
in the DMSO-treated carcinoma cells by sedimentation
fractionation (Fig. 2D-b). Thus, we conclude that
the binding of tylophorine to caprin-1 enhanced the
recruitment of G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, and cyclins D1/
D2 mRNA to the RNP complex. This hypothesis was also
confirmed by the association of caprin-1 with G3BP1,
c-Myc mRNA, and cyclins D1/D2 in polysomal fractions
only in tylophorine- but not vehicle-treated carcinoma
cells (Fig. 2D), whereas the c-Myc mRNA and cyclins
D1/D2 mRNA levels were elevated in tylophorine-treated
carcinoma cells (Fig. 2D-a and 3A).
The increased mRNA levels of c-Myc and cyclins
D1 and D2 induced upon tylophorine treatment of
the carcinoma cells might at least partially reflect an
impairment of mRNA degradation due to tylophorine
treatment, consistent with the dramatic decrease observed
in the number of P-bodies, which suggested a blockade
of cellular mRNA degradation processes. Moreover,
cytoplasmic mRNAs cycle between polysomes, P-bodies
and stress granules and translational repress can occur
in these compartments through different mechanisms
[46]. In addition to tylophorine treatment dramatically
decreased the formation of P-bodies (Fig. 5C), stress
granules were nearly not found either in DMSO or

Because tylophorine-related alkaloids potently
inhibit the growth of a wide variety of drug-sensitive
and drug-resistant cancer cell lines, we evaluated c-Myc
protein expression levels in a panel of carcinoma cell
lines (13 carcinoma cell lines from 9 types of tumors
and 2 fibroblast cell lines) with tylophorine treatment.
We observed the sustained blockade of c-Myc protein
expression in each of the individual carcinoma cell lines
upon treatment with tylophorine or its potent derivative
DBQ 33b[23] but not in the fibroblast cell lines. c-Myc
protein expression levels were reduced to 1-33% (Fig.
6A), whereas c-Myc mRNA levels were increased by
1.5-4.5-fold (Figs. 3A, 6B, & 6C). We also performed
gene expression profiling and analysis of the c-Myc
downstream pathways that were affected by tylophorine
or DBQ 33b (Fig. 6B), as well as validation by RT-qPCR
(Fig. 6C). Both compounds increased the expression of
c-Myc mRNA by ~2-4-fold; the mRNA levels of genes
that were upregulated by c-Myc were decreased (e.g.,
cyclin A2, cyclin B1, SERBP1, PRDX3, and POLR3G),
and the mRNA levels of genes that were downregulated
by c-Myc increased (e.g., GADD45A, and THBS1) (Fig.
6B and 6C). These results are consistent with the above
observation that increased c-Myc mRNA levels and
decreased c-Myc protein levels occurred in tylophorinetreated cells, which led to negative regulation of c-Myc
effector pathways. The genes, whose expression was
upregulated or downregulated by tylophorine and
DBQ 33b, associated with the function of c-Myc in
carcinogenesis are shown in Figure 6D.
In a mouse tumor model using human lung A549
carcinoma xenografts, DBQ 33b significantly reduced the
tumor volume in a dose-dependent manner[23]. Finally, we
examined the c-Myc protein and its mRNA expression in
these xenograft tumors[23]. Our results further confirmed
reductions in c-Myc protein levels with concomitant
increases in its mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner
in the DBQ 33b-treated tumors compared to the vehicletreated tumors (Fig. 6E and 6F). These results correlated
with the in vivo anti-tumor activity[23] and in vitro anticancer results for DBQ 33b (Fig. 6A, 6B, & 6C).

DISCUSSION
In this study, it was found that tylophorine
compounds exert their anti-cancer activities via targeting
the caprin-1, G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, and cyclin D2
or D1 mRNAs containing RNP complex, inhibiting
the functions of the RNP components and blocking the
protein translation of the corresponding mRNA transcripts
(e.g., c-Myc, cyclin D2, and cyclin D1, as well as their

tylophorine treated carcinoma cells (Supplemental Figure
1). Using TAMRA to label the newly synthesized protein
by tylophorine treatment, we clearly demonstrated that
tylophorine repressed the protein expression of c-Myc and
cyclins D1/D2 (Fig. 3C). These results further firm that
tylophorine sequestered the RNP containing caprin-1 and
c-Myc mRNA in the polysomal fractions (Fig. 2D) and
blocked the corresponding mRNAs’ translation. However,
the detailed underlying mechanisms must be carefully
addressed and further investigated. Our results suggest
that caprin-1 is highly associated with the transport of
c-Myc, cyclin D1, and cyclin D2 mRNAs for translation.
Thus, the abrogation of this specific biological function of
caprin-1 results in the induction of cell cycle arrest at the

G1 phase[47].
The expression of c-Myc is elevated in numerous
tumor types as the result of multiple mechanisms. c-Myc
accumulates at the promoter regions of active genes in
carcinoma cells, leading to their abnormal transcriptional
amplification and oncogenicity [48]. Therefore, the
upregulation of c-Myc is generally associated with tumor
aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome. Thus, it is
conceivable that the inhibition of c-Myc significantly
contributes to the broad-spectrum anti-cancer activity of
tylophorine compounds against drug-resistant carcinoma
cells. Moreover, the induction of cell cycle arrest at G1[47]
by knockdown of caprin-1 suggests that, in addition to the
caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNA-associated RNP complex,

tylophorine compounds to caprin-1, c-Myc, and the related pathways. The dashed lines indicate the previously published c-Jun-mediated
anti-cancer mechanism of tylophorine[25] including the results shown in Supplemental Figure 2 for decreased PTEN. The elevation
of c-Jun by tylophorine compounds is not affected by ectopically overexpressed c-Myc as shown in Supplemental Figure 3 indicating
that the tylophorine compounds target the caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNA-containing RNP complexes in parallel with their effects on c-Jun
accumulation to elicit anti-cancer activity.

caprin-1 itself may have favorable potential as a novel
anti-cancer drug target.
Ultimately, the blockade of c-Myc mRNA
transport by the tylophorine-mediated sequester of the
caprin-1, G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, and cyclin D2 mRNAcontaining RNP complex may contribute significantly
to the anti-cancer effects elicited by tylophorine in
conjunction with the accumulation of c-Jun[25] (Fig.
7). Tylophorine enhances the c-Jun downregulation of
the cyclin A2 promoter activity and results in carcinoma
cells dominantly arrested at G1 phase for anti-cancer
activity[25]. The ectopically overexpressed c-Myc did not
affect the accumulation of c-Jun induced by tylophorine
treatment but did increase the expression of cyclin A2 via
hyperphosphorylated pRb (Supplemental Figure 2 and
Fig. 4B). Thus, we conclude that the elevation of c-Jun
levels by tylophorine [23, 25] functions in concert with
the targeting of the caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNA-containing
RNP complex to produce the anti-cancer activity of
tylophorine compounds (Fig. 7).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tylophorine compounds
tylophorine (BT)

and

biotinylated

Tylophorine and DBQ 33b were prepared as
described with a purity greater than 95% as determined
by reverse pahse-HPLC[23]. The scheme for synthesis of
biotinylated tylophorine, with purity of 95.87% analyzed
by reverse pahse-HPLC, was shown in Figure 1A (see
NMR data below and Supplemental Figure 4).
Compound 1 was prepared as previously described
[49] and reacted overnight with a mixture of NaH and
tert-butyl (2-bromoethyl) carbamate in DMF to produce
compound 2. We reduced compound 2 with LiAlH4 and
AlCl3 (at a 3:1 ratio) in THF at room temperature for 4 h
to produce compound 3. The N-Boc-protected amine was
deprotected with H2SO4 in CH2Cl2 at room temperature
for 22 h to produce compound 4. Finally, Biotin-X-SSE
(Invitrogen) was coupled to compound 4 using Et3N in
DMF at room temperature for 22 h to produce compound

Cell Growth Inhibitory Assays
HONE-1, caprin-1 silencing HONE-1 cells (3000
cells/well), MCF-7 (6500 cells/well ) and NUGC-3 (4500
cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates and subjected
to measurement of growth inhibition by tylophorine,
biotinlylated tylophorine, or DBQ 33b and the IC50 values
were determined as previously described[18].

tylophorine-associated complexes were then pulled
down using streptavidin Dynabeads M280 (Invitrogen)
at 4°C for 1.5 h. The biotinylated tylophorine-bound
proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and analyzed
by electrophoresis on a 4%–20% gradient SDS-PAGE
gel (W/H: 16 cm X 15 cm) and visualized by silver
staining (Amersham Biosciences). The protein bands of
interest were excised, subjected to in-gel digestion (see
Supplemental Materials and Methods), and analyzed by
LC/MS/MS using a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). In addition, western
blot was used to identify the protein components from
the pull-down. The biotinylated tylophorine-bound RNAs
were eluted with TRizol Reagent (Invitrogen) and RT-PCR
was further used for analyzing the associated components.

min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatants were loaded on the
top of a 10-50% sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged in
a SW41Ti Beckman rotor at 4°C for 4 h at 36,000 rpm.
The fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes,
and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 254
nm using an AKTA puriﬁer (GE Healthcare, Amersham
Biosciences). RNA and protein were extracted using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Protein expression and
mRNA expression were further analyzed by western
immunoblot analysis and semi-RT-qPCR, respectively.

TAMRA Labeling and Detection of De Novo
Synthesized Proteins of Interest
HONE-1 cells were washed with PBS and cultured
with methionine-free DMEM (GIBCO-Life Technologies)
at 37°C for 1 h prior to the addition of 2 μM tylophorine
and 25 μM Click-iT® HPG (L-homopropargylglycine,
Invitrogen) and incubation at 37°C for 24 h. The cells
were then harvested and subjected to the Click Reaction
with 20 μM TAMRA (Tetramethylrhodamine, Invitrogen)
for labeling the de novo synthesized proteins in Click-iT®
Protein Reaction Buffer according to the manufacturers’
protocol (Invitrogen). The resultant cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated with anti-caprin-1 (ProteinTech
Group), anti-c-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology), anticyclin D1, anti-cyclin D2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-TAMRA (Thermo Scientific) or GAR (Perkin-Elmer)
respectively overnight at 4°C with constant agitation prior
to incubation with protein G agarose (Millipore) at 4°C for
another 2 h. After washes, the specific immunoprecipitated
protein was eluted and analyzed by western immunoblot
analysis with the antibody indicated.

Reverse transcription (RT) and quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
The previously described procedure was used[21].
The mRNA expression levels in Figures 2B, 2D, and 3A
were determined by semi-RT-qPCR, analyzed using the
Gel-Pro Analyzer program, and normalized using the
housekeeping gene GAPDH when necessary. In Figure 6,
the changes in mRNA expression levels were determined
using the ∆∆CT method with GAPDH housekeeping
genes. The primer pairs used in the PCR reactions are
listed in Supplemental Table 3.

Western analyses and co-immunoprecipitation
We performed western blotting as previously
described[18, 20] with antibody listed in Supplemental
Table 5. See Supplemental Materials and Methods for
co-immunoprecipitation using anti-caprin-1 antibody
(ProteinTech Group).

CAPRIN1 Gene Silencing

CAPRIN1-pCMV6-entry was obtained from
Origene, and transfected in HEK-293 cells. Expressed
caprin-1 was purified using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel
(Sigma-Aldrich). After washes with TBS buffer, the
human caprin-1 protein was eluted with 3X Flag peptide
(N-Met-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-His-Asp-Gly-Asp-Tyr-LysAsp-His-Asp-Ile-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-C,
Sigma-Aldrich).

HONE-1 cells were transfected with CAPRIN1
shRNA plasmid (TL312677, origene), or scrambled
pGFP-C-shLenti shRNA (TR30021, origene) using
FuGene 6TM (Roche). At 72 h post transfection, the cells
were cultured in the presence of 1.5 mg/mL puromycin for
selection. In addition, pseudotyped lentivirus containing
CAPRIN1 shRNA (clone ID: TRCN0000115975 and
TRCN0000115976) or negative control shRNA (shLacZ,
clone ID: TRCN72224)(Academia Sinica, Taiwan) were
transducted into HONE-1 cells with MOI of 3 in culture
medium containing 8 μg/ml polybrene (Millipore). At 24
h post transduction, the cells were cultured in the presence
of 1.5 mg/mL puromycin for selection.

the HONE-1 cells were treated with either the vehicle
control (0.1% DMSO) or 0.2 to 2 µM tylophorine for an
additional 24 h. The cells were then harvested in lysis
buffer as described above prior to immunoblot analyses.

HONE-1 cells were treated with the vehicle control
(0.1% DMSO), 0.5 µM DBQ 33b, or 2 µM tylophorine.
After treatment with the compounds for 24 h, total RNA
was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and
expression profiling of the coding genes performed using
the Illumina Human HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip.
Furthermore, the gene expression data from the Illumina
arrays were validated by real-time RT-qPCR.
