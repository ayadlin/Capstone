BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and relapsefree survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) with trastuzumab in combination with an anthracycline- or nonanthracycline-based regimen. METHODS: In this retrospective
nonrandomized study, the authors reviewed records of 300 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with
either sequential paclitaxel and trastuzumab and FEC75 in combination with trastuzumab (PH-FECH) or docetaxel,
carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH). The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to estimate RFS and OS rates.
Logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazards models were fit to determine the associations between
NST, pCR, and survival. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the decline in cardiac ejection fraction; however, patients who received PH-FECH had fewer cardiac comorbidities at baseline (P ¼.002). pCR rates were 60.6%
and 43.3% for patients who received PH-FECH (n ¼ 235) and TCH (n ¼ 65), respectively (P ¼.016). Patients who
received PH-FECH were 1.45 times more likely to have a pCR (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.06-1.98; P ¼.02). Three-year RFS rates were 93% and 71% (P <.001), and 3-year OS rates were 96% and 86%
(P ¼.008) for patients who received PH-FECH and TCH, respectively. Patients who received PH-FECH had a lower
risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; 95% CI, 0.12-0.60; P ¼.001) and death (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.12-1.13; P ¼.08)
than those treated with TCH. CONCLUSIONS: The type of NST in HER2-positive breast cancer is predictive of pCR
rate independent of disease and patient characteristics. Although TCH is active, PH-FECH shows a higher pCR rate

INTRODUCTION
Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) has been the standard of care for patients with inflammatory and locally
advanced breast cancer and is increasingly being used for early-stage disease. NST allows the measurement of treatment
response in addition to survival. Several studies have indicated that pathologic complete response (pCR) to NST is predictive of improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).1-3
With the introduction of anthracycline-based regimens, 5-year survival rates have significantly improved in patients
with early-stage breast cancer.4 With the addition of trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the human epidermal
growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), improvements in OS have been observed among patients with advanced HER2-positive
disease.5,6 However, in a pivotal phase III trial in metastatic breast cancer, the concurrent administration of anthracyclines
and trastuzumab resulted in an unacceptably high rate (27%) of cardiotoxicity.7 Findings from the N9831 adjuvant trial
suggested the superiority of concomitant chemotherapy and trastuzumab (doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed

by paclitaxel with trastuzumab) over sequential use of the
same therapies (doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide
followed by paclitaxel, followed by trastuzumab).7-9
Although cardiotoxicity was more frequent with sequential doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide and taxane-trastuzumab than nonanthracycline-based trastuzumab regimens,
the majority of patients who received therapy displayed
neither acute nor delayed cardiac dysfunction (CD).
Afterward, several studies10-12 have evaluated concurrent
administration of anthracycline-based chemotherapy and
trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. In contrast to previous reports, trastuzumab plus anthracycline-based NST
was both effective and well tolerated.
Therefore, we conducted this retrospective analysis
to determine the efficacy of concurrent trastuzumab in
combination with anthracycline-based or nonanthracycline-based NST. Our primary objective was to compare
the pCR rates between the 2 treatment groups. Secondary
end points included clinical and radiologic response rates,
RFS, and OS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
The Breast Cancer Management System database of The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC) identified 300 women who were diagnosed
with HER2-positive invasive breast cancer and treated
with NST using either sequential paclitaxel and trastuzumab and FEC-75 in combination with trastuzumab
(PH-FECH) or docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab
(TCH) between 2001 and 2009. We excluded patients
who were male, who had metastatic disease, bilateral
breast cancer, or more than 1 primary tumor, whose pathologic response could not be assessed, or who were
enrolled in the American College of Surgeons Oncology
Group (ACOSOG) Z1041 trial. Initial clinical and final
pathologic stage were based on the seventh edition of the
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging
criteria.13
The study was approved by the MDACC Institutional Review Board. Accuracy of clinical variables
recorded within the database was verified by retrospective
review of patient records.
Pathologic Evaluation
Pathologic specimens were reviewed by dedicated breast
pathologists at MDACC. Histologic type and grade were
defined according to the World Health Organization

2386

(WHO) classification system14 and modified Black’s
nuclear grading system,15 respectively. Nuclear staining
10% of estrogen-receptor (ER) or progesterone-receptor
(PR) was considered strongly positive. HER2 positivity was
defined as 3þ receptor overexpression on immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and/or gene amplification
on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
Treatment
The type of NST was at the discretion of the patient and
treating oncologist; 235 patients received PH-FECH, and
65 received TCH chemotherapy. PH-FECH included
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) weekly for
12 weeks or paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 IV over 24 hours every
3 weeks, followed by 4 cycles of FEC-75 (fluorouracil
500 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) IV on day 1, every 3 weeks. A loading
dose of 4 mg/kg IV trastuzumab was given on day 1
followed by 2 mg/kg weekly, during the 24 weeks of
NST. The nonanthracycline-based NST (TCH) included
docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV on day 1, carboplatin at an areaunder-the-concentration curve (AUC) of 6 IV on day
1, and trastuzumab 8 mg/kg IV on day 1 followed by
6 mg/kg maintenance dose, administered at 3-week intervals for 6 cycles. PH-FECH and TCH NST were given as
planned in 231 (98%) and 61 patients (94%), respectively. However, 7 patients who received PH-FECH (2%)
and 9 that received TCH (14%) did not complete a year
of trastuzumab.
Surgical intervention was breast-conserving surgery
(BCS) for 29% of patients (n ¼ 87) and mastectomy for
68% (n ¼ 204); 3% (n ¼ 9) did not have surgery as a
result of the development of progressive disease or patient
refusal. Radiation therapy was given for patients who had
BCS, locally advanced disease, or inflammatory breast
cancer (IBC). Women with hormone receptor-positive
disease were offered 5 years of adjuvant endocrine
therapy.
Response and Toxicity Assessments
A clinical complete response (cCR) was defined as no detectable disease in breast and axilla on physical examination. Radiologic response was evaluated at baseline and
before surgery based on Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors [RECIST].16 pCR was defined as the
absence of invasive disease in the breast and the absence of
micro- or macrometastases in the ipsilateral axillary lymph
nodes. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was
evaluated by an echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated

(AEs) for nonlaboratory toxicities were summarized
according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.17
Statistical Analysis and Outcome Measures
Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, pCR rate,
comorbidities, and AEs were compared between the 2
groups with chi-square test. Multivariate logistic regression
models were fitted to examine the relation between NST
groups and pCR. RFS was defined as the time from the first
dose of NST until the first date of documented local or distant recurrence or the date of last follow-up. Patients who
died from unrelated causes were censored. OS was measured from the first dose of NST until the date of death
from any cause or last follow-up. Survival outcomes were
estimated with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method.
Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to determine
the association of NST with survival outcomes after adjustment for significant patient and clinical characteristics identified in univariate analyses. Statistical analyses were carried
out using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and
S-Plus 7.0 (Insightful Corporation, Seattle, WA).

FECH were younger (P ¼ .005), had lower tumor stage
(P ¼ .001), and were less likely to have IBC (P < .001)
compared with patients treated with TCH. Patients who
received PH-FECH at baseline had fewer cardiac comorbidities (P ¼ .002) and cardiac risk factors (P ¼ .12) when
compared with patients who received TCH (Table 1).
Efficacy
Of 300 patients, 80.8% had cCR in the PH-FECH group
versus 58.9% in the TCH group (P ¼ .006; Table 2). The
radiologic overall response rates (ORR) were 97.0% in
the PH-FECH group versus 98.1% in the TCH group
(P ¼ .67). Excluding IBC patients, cCR rates were 79.9%
and 51.3% (P ¼ .002), and radiologic ORR were 97.2%
and 97.3% (P ¼ .98) in the PH-FECH and TCH groups,
respectively.
The pCR rate was significantly higher in patients
treated with PH-FECH compared with patients treated
with TCH (60.6% vs 43.3%; P ¼ .016) (Table 2). In the
PH-FECH group, pCR was achieved in 57% (105 of
183) of patients treated with weekly paclitaxel and 61%
(32 of 52) of patients treated with every 3-week paclitaxel.
pCR rate was higher for ER compared with ERþ
tumors in both the PH-FECH (70.3% vs 47.6%) and the

versus 50% (2 of 4) for T4b tumors, and 55.5% (10 of

patients, pCR rate was 60.5% for patients who received
PH-FECH compared with 42.9% for those who received
TCH (P ¼ .035).
On multivariate analysis, PH-FECH was associated
with a higher pCR rate (odds ratios [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.98; P ¼ .02). In addition,
patients with ER-negative/weak tumors (P < .001),
higher nuclear grade (P ¼ .05), and pretreatment T1-3
status (P ¼ .043) were more likely to achieve a pCR
(Table 3). After excluding the IBC patients, PH-FECH
remained an independent significant predictor for pCR
(OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.02-2.08; P ¼ .039).
Survival Estimates
Median follow-up of survivors was 26.8 months (range,
5-99 months); the follow-up was 29 months and 18
months for the PH-FECH group and the TCH group,
respectively. The estimated 3-year RFS was 93% in the
PH-FECH versus 71% in the TCH group; P < .001
(Table 4). Excluding IBC patients, the 3-year RFS estimates were again better for the patients who received PHFECH compared with the patients who received TCH
(94% vs 80%; P ¼ .01) (Fig. 1C).
Patients who achieved pCR had better RFS than
patients who did not (95% vs 83%; P ¼ .003). Among
patients with pCR, patients who received PH-FECH had
better 3-year RFS compared with TCH (97% vs 82%;
P ¼ .008). In the multivariate model, PH-FECH was
associated with a lower risk of recurrence (hazard ratio
[HR] ¼ .27; 95% CI, 0.12-0.60; P ¼ .001). This

patients without IBC, there were no differences in the 3year OS estimates for the patients who received PHFECH compared with the patients who received TCH
(96% vs 100%; P ¼ .98). The multivariate Cox proporCancer

tional hazards model showed that PH-FECH tended to
be associated with a lower risk of death (HR ¼ 0.37, 95%
CI, 0.12-1.13; P ¼ .08). When excluding patients with
IBC, there was no association (HR ¼ 1.06; 95% CI, 0.138.61; P ¼ .96).
Toxicity
No significant differences were noted in nonlaboratory
AEs and cardiotoxicity with respect to NST regimen
received (Table 5). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline was 64.3% in the PH-FECH
group and 64.7% in the TCH group. The mean calculated percent decline in LVEF from baseline to the lowest

detected during follow-up was 8% in both treatment
groups (P ¼ .52). However, 1 patient on PH-FECH
developed congestive heart failure and died from sudden
cardiac death.

DISCUSSION
Several trials have examined the potential benefits of concurrent trastuzumab in combination with anthracyclinebased11,12,18-21 or nonanthracycline-based neoadjuvant
therapy22-29 in HER2-positive breast cancer, with reported
pCR rates of up to 76%.30 In this retrospective nonrandomized study, we showed that although TCH is active,
trastuzumab combined with a taxane and then with an
anthracycline (PH-FECH) shows higher pCR rate.
The high pCR rates in our study are consistent with
previous trials that assessed the use of trastuzumab as part
of an anthracycline-based NST regimen in operable and
locally advanced breast cancer. In the MDACC10 trial,
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer received paclitaxel followed by FEC75, with or without concurrent trastuzumab. The pCR rate increased from 26% to 65%
(P ¼ .02) with trastuzumab. An expansion cohort in the
experimental arm (n ¼ 22) continued to show high rates
of pCR (54.5%) without significant cardiac toxicity.19
The combined pCR rate for all patients who received trastuzumab was 60%, and at a median follow-up of 36.1
months, there had been no recurrences. The Neoadjuvant
Herceptin (NOAH) trial evaluated the sequential administration of 3 cycles of doxorubicin and paclitaxel followed
by 4 cycles of paclitaxel alone, then 3 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil with or without concomitant trastuzumab.11 Patients with HER2positive disease who received concurrent trastuzumab had
a significantly higher pCR rate (43% vs 23%; P ¼ .002),
ORR (89% vs 77%; P ¼ .02), and 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) (70.1% vs 53.3%; P ¼ .007) compared with
those who received chemotherapy alone. A pCR benefit
with the addition of trastuzumab was also observed
among IBC patients (39% vs 20%; P ¼ .002). In the
phase III German Breast Group/Gynecologic Oncology
Study Group trial (the GeparQuattro trial),12 patients
with HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer were
treated with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by
docetaxel with or without capecitabine, and trastuzumab
every 3 weeks. Neoadjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy demonstrated a significant increase in pCR rates
(15.7% vs 31.7%; P < .001). pCR rates with neoadjuvant
trastuzumab and anthracycline-free regimens in other
studies range from 11% to 76%.22,24,25,30-35

Due to concerns about cardiotoxicity, there has
been interest in developing nonanthracycline-containing
regimens. BCIRG 00636 evaluated AC followed by docetaxel (AC/T) versus AC followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab (AC/TH) versus TCH for the adjuvant treatment
of HER2-positive breast cancer. In a recent updated analysis with 656 DFS events, DFS was improved by 36%
with AC/TH (P ¼ .001) and by 25% with TCH
(P ¼ .04) relative to the AC/T arm. The risk of death was
reduced by 37% with AC/TH (P < .001) and 23% with
TCH (P ¼ .038) relative to the AC/T arm.37 There was
no statistically significant difference in 5-year DFS
(P ¼ .21) and OS (P ¼ .14) between the trastuzumabCancer

containing regimens. The results of this trial not only confirmed the importance of trastuzumab for HER2-positive
breast cancer, but it also greatly increased interest in the
use of nonanthracycline-trastuzumab–based regimen,
TCH, for adjuvant therapy.
In our study, PH-FECH and TCH NST yielded
different pCR rates (60.6% vs 43.3%; P ¼ .016). However, pCR rates relate inversely to larger tumor size, lower
nuclear grade, and ER-positivity.22,37 In addition to the
significant differences in age and T stage between our
study groups, the patients in the TCH group were
more overweight and had more frequent unfavorable
disease characteristics (nonductal histologies, stage IIIB,

2391

Original Article

and N1/2 disease) that may have led to lower pCR rates
and worse survival outcomes. In our multivariate analysis,
PH-FECH demonstrated superiority in clinical outcome
even when other variables were considered. Although the
multivariable analysis compensates for much of the covariate imbalances, it probably does not account for all. It
remains to be determined whether the differences in outcomes between the groups were the result of the antitumor
effect of anthracyclines, synergy from the combination of
anthracyclines with trastuzumab, or the additional duration of therapy. Future randomized studies with larger
prospective cohorts and longer-term follow-up are needed
to validate these findings.
Although trastuzumab-based therapies have been
associated with an increased incidence of cardiac dysfunction (CD), especially when combined with anthracyclines, 3 large clinical trials10-12 demonstrated that the
combination was both effective and well tolerated. Overall, the CD incidence in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant
settings ranged from none observed10,27 to 10.5%,38
and 2.0%36 to 3.3%,39,40 respectively. Caution should
be exercised in women with risk factors for cardiac toxicity because data from B-31 indicate that women who
develop severe cardiac toxicity from anthracycline-based
regimens do not always fully recover.41 In addition,
B-3141 and N983142 demonstrated that 5.0% to 6.6%
of women who received anthracyclines were unable to
receive trastuzumab. Nonetheless, in the GeparQuattro
trial12 concurrent administration of trastuzumab with
epirubicin yielded persistent decrease in LVEF to <50%
in only 1 patient. In this study, although the patients
who received TCH had more baseline cardiac comorbidities and cardiac risk factors, there were no differences in
the baseline LVEF or magnitude of decrease in the
LVEF after NST.
The treatment benefits need to be weighed against
the risk of cardiotoxicity. The cardiac death in a patient
who received PH-FECH further highlights the importance of careful patient selection and close cardiac monitoring. One potential approach to minimize
cardiotoxicity would be to administer trastuzumab after
completion of anthracyclines. However, the comparative
antitumor efficacy of this approach is not known. This
specific question is currently being tested in the ongoing
ACOSOG Z1041 trial.
Our study is limited by its retrospective nature and
small sample size in the TCH cohort. Patient selection for
individual treatment regimens may have impacted the
differences in oncologic outcome. Fewer patients with

2392

cardiac comorbidities received PH-FECH, which may
have minimized CD observed in the anthracycline cohort.
On the other hand, we showed that the incidence of CD
is comparable to previous trials in which more selective
eligibility criteria and better cardiac monitoring are
applied.
In conclusion, the results of our retrospective analysis suggest that the type of NST in HER2-positive breast
cancer is predictive of pCR rate independent of disease
characteristics. Although TCH is active, trastuzumab
combined with an anthracycline-based NST showed
higher pCR rate and a RFS advantage.
