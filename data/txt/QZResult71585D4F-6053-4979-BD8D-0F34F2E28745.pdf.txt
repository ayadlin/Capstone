ABSTRACT
ABCG2, member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, is known as
crucial regulator related to multi-drug resistance in human tumors and has recently
been putatively studied as human carcinoma cell biomarker. While, effects of ABCG2
on human gastric cancer (GC) has not been illustrated thoroughly. In this study,
by applying biostatistics mining methods, we observed that ABCG2 is frequently
aberrantly expressed in GC patients through exploring dataset of GSE19826 in NCBI
GEO database. Contemporary, extreme up-regulation of ABCG2 was discovered in
both GC specimens and cell lines of our center, from which we observed high level of
ABCG2 associated with GC clinicopathologic features and poor outcomes. Depletion of
ABCG2 in MKN-45 GC cells, the cell proliferation was significantly impacted along with
cell cycle arrest, and cell apoptosis was induced. Interestingly, combined with data
mining of NCBI database, CRKL, a pivotal GC promoter, presents a significant positive
correlation with ABCG2. And the expression of CRKL in GC cells was obviously affected
through ABCG2 depletion. Simultaneously, over-expression of CRKL in MKN-45 cells
significantly rescued most of the phenotypes induced by ABCG2 depletion. Thus, we
suggest that ABCG2 is a potential biomarker and target upstream CRKL, which could
be further studied for GC diagnosis and therapeutic treatment

(ABC) transporter family. It was firstly discovered in a
process involving in multidrug resistance (MDR) from
doxorubicin-resistant human MCF-7 breast cancer
cells [4–6], and was also reported to induce sorafenib
resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells [7].
Further investigation indicated that ABCG2 is overexpressed in various tumor cells [8, 9]. Recently, ABCG2
has been studied as a potential marker of cancer stem
cells (CSCs) in diverse human malignances, associated
with tumor initiation, maintenance, relapse, metastasis
and MDR, which suggests ABCG2 a hopeful target in
cancer treatment [9–13]. As reported by Jiang, et.al,

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common
human carcinomas around the world, contributing to
10% newly diagnosed cases per year with relatively
high mortality in patients of advanced stages [1]. The
challenges of finding associated gastric tumor markers
and understanding the mechanisms of GC initiation,
progression and metastasis, are keys to detecting GC in
early stages and target treatment [2, 3].
ATP-binding cassette subfamily G, member 2
(ABCG2), is a member of the ATP-binding cassette

ABCG2 might present as a highly expressed stem cell
biomarker in GC cells, which is associated with pooror un-differentiated cell status [14]. However, the
evidence that ABCG2 affects GC cells throughout the
tumorigenic process is not adequate thoroughly in GC
for translational application for clinic.
In this study, we firstly mined and discovered
aberrant expression of ABCG2 in GC patients from
NCBI database, which directed us to conduct further
investigation in both GC tumor tissues and cell lines.
As observed, ABCG2 is over-expressed in GC tumors
specimens and cell lines. The highly expressed ABCG2
is associated with poor outcomes of GC patients with
more advanced clinicopathologic features. By depleting
ABCG2 in one of the GC cell lines, MKN-45, the cell
growth and apoptosis status was significantly affected.
And interestingly, CRKL, a crucial promoter of GC, was
subsequently down-regulated in MKN-45 cells. Thus we
wondered if there exists regulation between ABCG2 and
CRKL. As what we found, ABCG2 is a potential regulator
of downstream CRKL, and ectopic introduction of CRKL
into MKN-45 cells significantly rescues the phenotypes
induced by ABCG2 depletion. Thus, what we discovered
here indicates ABCG2 as a promoter in GC cells through
regulating CRKL.

of 19% of the 72 cases, and the cases of ‘low expression’
consisted of almost 81% (58/72). Thus, ABCG2 was
highly expressed in tumor tissues compared with the
adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P < 0.01).

RESULTS

According to the expression status of ABCG2 in
GC, we speculated a correlationship between expression
level of ABCG2 and the GC clinicopathologic features. As
Table 1 shown, we listed the expression characteristic of
ABCG2 in 72 GC cases. Among the 72 GC cases, higher
expression of ABCG2 presented significant inclination
towards larger tumor size (P < 0.05), deeper local
invasion (P < 0.05), more lymph node metastasis (P <
0.05) and advanced TNM stage (P < 0.05), while it had no
significant correlation between ABCG2 and patients’ age,
gender, tumor location. These results strongly suggested
a significant correlation between ABCG2 expression and
the GC clinicopathologic parameters concerning with poor
prognosis.

GC cell lines present high expression of ABCG2
compared with GES-1 cells
The immortalized gastric epithelium cell line
(GES-1) is regarded as control for comparison with the
GC cell lines. Three GC cells lines (MKN-45, SGC-7901
and MKN-28) were detected. As qRT-PCR and Western
blot analysis demonstrated, both mRNA and protein
levels of ABCG2 are significantly higher in the 3 GC cell
lines than in GES-1 cells (P<0.05) (Figure 2). Among
these 3 GC cell lines, MKN-45 cell, which is the poorly
differentiated one, presented the highest level of ABCG2.
Herein, the high expression characteristic of ABCG2 in
GC cells is consistent with the observation through IHC
of tumor tissues. And we further selected MKN-45 for
ABCG2 depletion.

Expression characteristic of ABCG2 is correlated
with the clinicopathologic features and ABCG2
is an independent prognostic factor of GC

ABCG2 is up-regulated through NCBI GEO
database mining and highly expressed in GC
tissues
The analysis result from Oncomine for GSE19826
was shown in Figure 1A, ABCG2 mRNA level in GC
tumor tissues is significantly higher than the paired
adjacent normal gastric mucosa, which indicate a frequent
over-expression of ABCG2 in GC tissues. Divided as high
ABCG2 expression group and low ABCG2 expression
group, tumor samples contribute to the dominant portion
of high ABCG2 expression group, while in low ABCG2
expression group, non-cancerous tissues contribute
to the dominant portion (Figure 1B). The density blot
demonstrates the distribution of ABCG2 expression in
dataset GSE19826 (Figure 1C).
Along with this observation of data mining, we
found through IHC detection that ABCG2 presents an
obvious higher expression level in tumor tissues of the 72
GC patients compared with the non-cancerous adjacent
tissues. Samples of the 72 patients were grouped as
ABCG2 ‘high expression’ and ‘low expression’ according
to the staining density of IHC. As Figure 1D–1E shown,
62.5% (45/72) of the tumor specimens presented
aberrantly high ABCG2 expression, and the cases of
‘low expression’ were counted only 27. For adjacent noncancerous tis sues, cases of ‘high expression’ were counted
only 14 in a relatively lower proportion, which consisted

Expression of ABCG2 and CRKL is positively
correlated in GC
Through analysis of microarray data in GSE19826,
we also found that CRKL, which has been verified as a
highly expressed gene independently related with poor
GC prognosis [15], was presented a significant positive
correlation with ABCG2.
As shown in Figure 3A–3D, along with the highly
expression of ABCG2, CRKL was significantly over
expressed in patients included in GSE19826 dataset, which
is consistent with our observation in the paired specimens.
In Table 1, we listed the expression characteristic of CRKL
in 52 GC cases of our previous research to compare with
ABCG2 in 72 GC cases of this study. Obviously, either
5257

high expression of CRKL or ABCG2 shares a similar
correlationship with GC clinicopathologic features
indicating poor prognosis.
Survival analysis of ABCG2 and CRKL conducted
by online Kaplan–Meier plotter tools was shown in Figure
3E–3F. Patients with high expression of either ABCG2 or
CRKL in tumor tissue presented a significant tendency
towards poor prognosis and high mortality (P < 0.05).
These results illustrated that both ABCG2 and CRKL are

associated with poor prognosis of GC, and are positively
correlated.

Depletion of ABCG2 suppresses MKN-45 cell
proliferation, arrests the cell cycle and induces
cell apoptosis
In this study, MKN-45 cells presented highest
ABCG2 expression among the three GC cell lines. By

Ectopic expression of CRKL rescues the
phenotype induced by ABCG2 depletion

transfecting MKN-45 cells with pGU6/Neo/siABCG2
vectors, we successfully impair the expression of ABCG2
in MKN-45 cells at both mRNA and protein stages
(Figure 4A). As the curve of cell proliferation shown in
Figure 4B, when ABCG2 depleted, cell proliferation
of MKN-45 cells was dramatically suppressed. Flow
cytometry analysis illustrated that the cell cycle of MKN45 cells was significantly arrested at G0/G1 phase along
with ABCG2 depression. The percentage of MKN-45
cells in G0/G1 phase was raised from 46.76% to 63.15%
(P=0.0164), and S phase and G2/M phase were decreased
respectively from 40.39% to 27.47% (P=0.0310) and from
12.85% to 10.05% (P=0.0436) (Figure 4C).
We also observed a significant increase of apoptosis
rate in MKN-45 cells from 6.02% to 8.01% (P=0.0353)
induced by ABCG2 through flow cytometry analysis
(Figure 4D). Results above suggested ABCG2 as a
promoter in GC cell proliferation and an inducer of cell
apoptosis resistance.

To verify if there exists functional relationship
between ABCG2 and CRKL, we introduced CRKL into
MKN-45 cells by using recombinant adenovirus Ad5/F35,
and validated a significant increase of CRKL expression in
MKN-45 cells by using qRT-PCR assay and Western blot
analysis (Figure 5B).
As Figure 5C shown, the inhibitory effect on
MKN-45 cell proliferation induced by ABCG2 depletion
was significantly reversed. Simultaneously, flow cytometry
analysis presented a significant decline of the percentage
of MKN-45 cells in G0/G1phase from 55.76% to 43.03%
(P=0.043). Cells at S phase were obviously increased
from 36.62% to 48.08% (P < 0.01) (Figure 5D). While,
no significant evidence was observed that the percentage
of G2/M phase was moderated (P=0.917). Despite the cell
proliferation and cell cycle being affected, the apoptosis
rate was not apparently declined when CRKL was overexpressed (P =0.379) (Figure 5E). Thus, we illustrated
that bio-function of ABCG2 on promoting GC process was
partly rescued by over-express CRKL, which indicates
ABCG2 is an upstream regulator modulating CRKL in
GC.

Depletion of ABCG2 down-regulates expression
of CRKL
The correlation between ABCG2 and CRKL
suggests us a potential regulating relationship between
these two genes. To validate this hypothesis, qRT-PCR and
Western blot analysis were conducted in ABCG2 depleted
MKN-45 cells. As the results demonstrated in Figure 5A,
when ABCG2 was down-regulated in GC cells, A dramatic
declined of CRKL expression at both mRNA level and
protein level was observed. This means ABCG2 is an
upstream regulator of CRKL in GC.

functional structure [21, 22]. In human beings, ABCA,
ABCB, ABCD and ABCG classes have been reported
carrying functional domains, or existing as halftransporters which play full transporter function in homoor hetero-dimers formation [23]. Among these genes,
ABCG2 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including
brain, placental syncytiotrophoblast, small intestine, and
colon, which has been hypothesized as a strong marker
participating in malignancy process [24–27]. However,
mechanism of ABCG2’s biological and molecular
functions in GC leaves much unclear.
In this study, first of all, we explored the database
of NCBI and aberrant expression of ABCG2 in GC
patients was discovered. According to this, we presumed
ABCG2 as a specific functional molecule modulated
in GC, and then further investigated the expression
characteristic of ABCG2 in both GC specimens and cell
lines. Immunohistopathological examination revealed a
significant higher expression of ABCG2 in 63% (45/72)
GC tumor specimens than the adjacent non-cancerous

tissues. Likewise, significantly higher expression of
ABCG2 was detected in all of the three GC cell lines
compared with GES-1 cells. These results validated that
ABCG2 is aberrantly up-regulated in GC.
Then, we compared ABCG2 expression of the
GC cases with the clinical pathologic features. The
results showed that higher ABCG2 expression presents a
significant inclination related to larger tumor size, deeper
local invasion and tendency of lymph node metastasis.
Moreover, high level of ABCG2 was correlated with
advanced TNM stages, correlated with poor prognosis.
The survival analysis of ABCG2 generated from the
publicly available gastric cancer patients’ database (http://
kmplot.com) confirmed that high expression of ABCG2
is associated with poor survival. This suggests ABCG2
as a critical molecule is correlated with GC process and
prognosis.
MKN-45 cells, which are the poorest differentiated
among the three GC cell lines, presented highest ABCG2
expression in this study. So, we selected MKN-45 cells

for exploring the function of ABCG2 in GC. Transfection
was conducted to deplete ABCG2 in this cell line. Along
with ABCG2 decline in GC cells, the cell proliferation
was exactly suppressed with a significant arrest of cell
cycle in G0/G1 phase. Meanwhile, the apoptosis rate of
ABCG2 was significantly increased, which suggests a
crippling of cell apoptosis resistance. These results prompt

that ABCG2 participates in the cell generation of GC and
prevents GC cell apoptosis. Interference of ABCG2 has
functional effect on GC diagnose and treatment.
In this study, we used biostatistics methods to explore
the potential correlated molecules downstream ABCG2.
In dataset GSE19826 from NCBI GEO, we noticed that
CRKL is significantly positive correlated with ABCG2 at

was knocked down in MKN-45 cells. The ability of cell proliferation of MKN-45 cells was significantly decreased by decreasing ABCG2.

expression status. CRKL is a kind of adapter protein of
the CRK protein involved in various human diseases [28].
Accumulating evidence has verified CRKL as a promoting
factor in multiple cancer progress. CRKL participates in
regulating the Erk1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways and induces
promotion of cell invasion and migration in breast cancer
cells [29]; over-expression of CRKL significantly increases

cell proliferation and invasion in two pancreatic cancer cell
lines (Capan-2 and Bxpc-3), which suggests a promoting
function of CRKL in pancreatic cancer [30]. In our previous
research, CRKL was identified up-regulated in multiple GC
cell lines, including MKN-45, SGC-7901 and MKN-2 cells
[15]. CRKL promotes GC cell proliferation, arrests the cell
cycle and significantly induces cell invasion and migration.

Figure 5: CRKL was modulated by ABCG2 depletion and partly reversed the biological phenomena induced by
ABCG2 depletion in MKN-45 cells. A. QRT-PCR and Western blot anaylsis was carried out. Expression of CRKL at both mRNA
and protein stage was suppressed significantly after ABCG2 depletion in MKN-45 cells (*P < 0.05). B. Ectopic expression of CRKL was
conducted by transfecting recombinant adenovirus Ad5/F35. Significant increase of CRKL mRNA and protein was observed in MKN45 cells with ABCG2 depletion (*P < 0.05). C. Ectopic expression of CRKL in MKN-45 cells with ABCG2 depletion modulated the
expression of ABCG2 significantly neigther at mRNA stage nor at protein stage. D. WST assay was carried out to determine the cell
proliferation ability after CRKL ectopic expression in MKN-45 cells. Cell proliferation suppression induced by ABCG2 depletion in MKN45 cells was significantly reversed by introducing CRKL. The results are means of three independent experiments ± SD. (**P < 0.01, *P <
0.05). E. Proportion of cells in various phases of the cell cycle was detected by Flow cytometry. Ectopic expression of CRKL rescued the
cell arrest at G0/G1 phase induced by ABCG2 depletion (*P < 0.05), and the proportion of cells at S phases was obviously increased (*P <
0.05). There observed no significant moderation at G2/M phase (P=0.917). The results are means of three independent experiments ± SD.
F. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the effect of CRKL on cell apoptosis under the depletion of ABCG2. The results are means of three
independent experiments ± SD. The apoptosis rate of MKN-45 cells with ABCG2 depletion seems no significant difference when CRKL
was ectopically expressed according to the P value (P=0.379).

However, we have not observed any evidence of CRKL
effecting on GC cell apoptosis, which probably suggests
other mechanism involves with the GC cell apoptosis
modulation.
Here, according to the results from biostatistics
analysis, higher expression of either ABCG2 or CRKL
presents close relationship with more advanced GC stages
and poor prognosis. Both of the two molecules show the
poor survival rate respectively of GC patients at higher
expression level. Interestingly, CRKL was significantly
down-regulated in GC cells after ABCG2 depleting.
We hypothesized that there is some regulating event
between ABCG2 and CRKL. We transfected recombinant
adenovirus Ad5/F35 (Ad5/F35-CRKL) into ABCG2
depleted MKN-45 cells to ectopically express CRKL.
Up-regulation of CRKL significantly reversed the cell
proliferation depression induced by ABCG2 depletion.
The portion of cells arrested in the G0/G1 phase was
declined simultaneously. Within this modulation, we found
that most of the GC cells were distributing at the S phase,
but not the G2/M phase through ectopically up-regulating
CRKL. However, the cell apoptosis rate decreased by
down-regulating ABCG2 could not be significantly
rescued. Therefore, we suppose that CRKL acts as one
of the downstream effective molecules moderated by
ABCG2, which affects GC cell proliferation and rescues
the arrest of the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. However,
we believe that there exist other functional molecules
downstream of ABCG2, which involves with GC cell
apoptosis.
The results we explored in this study strongly
indicate a regulating correlation between ABCG2
and CRKL, and also the influence of ABCG2 on cell
proliferation and apoptosis. We validated that ABCG2
was a molecule aberrantly up-regulated in GC tissues and
cells. The higher level of ABCG2 expression in GC cells
was correlated with advanced stages of GC involved with
poor prognosis. ABCG2 was a GC promoter affecting
cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis resistance.
Combining with biostatistics analysis, we found the
expression of ABCG2 and CRKL is positively correlated,
and CRKL is one of the downstream molecules regulated
by ABCG2, which promotes cell growth.However,
ABCG2 appears to be a mambrane bound molecule, and
there is no evidence indicates ABCG2 as a transcription
factor in cellular process. The way ABCG2 regulating
CRKL is not clear. And the possible mechanism of
ABCG2 affecting GC cell proliferation and apoptosis still
needs to be illustrated.

There are 26 samples after removing 1 outlier on the
quality control with 12 tumor samples vs. 14 normal
gastric mucosa samples in this dataset. These data were
preprocessed and analyzed by online database tools
Oncomine (http://oncomine.org/). The differential
expression comparison of ABCG2 between tumor and
non-tumor samples was conducted by student’s t-test. The
correlation between ABCG2 and other potential genes was
also detected.
Association analysis for the ABCG2 mRNA and
protein expression and 72 cases’ clinicopathologic features
was carried out by SPSS 18.0. P values were calculated by
paired t-test and Fisher’s exact text. P values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
For the survival analysis of ABCG2 and CRKL,
we use online tool (http://www.kmplot.com/gastric)
to generate Kaplan–Meier curves, which include 876
gastric cancer patients with available clinical data. For
the expression of the genes, each percentile of expression
between the lower and upper quartiles was computed and
the best performing threshold was used as the final cutoff
for the Univariate Cox regression analysis. Kaplan–Meier
survival plot were downloaded from their website and
the hazard ratio with 95% confidence and P Value were
calculated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Antibodies against ABCG2, CRKL and GAPDH
(Santa Cruz, USA) were purchased, and horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Abcam,
USA) was prepared. Immunohistochemistry analysis was
carried out on the tissue microarray. Antibody against
ABCG2 was used following the manufactory instruction

Cell culture and surgical specimens
The GES-1 cell line and four GC cell lines (MKN45, SGC-7901 and MKN-28) were purchased from
Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese
Academy of Science (Shanghai, China). All cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 ug/ml
streptomycin and 100U/ml Penicillin in a humidified cell
incubator at 37°C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Seventy two pairs of gastric cancer specimens along
with the adjacent non-cancerous tissues were collected
from GC patients performed radical gastrectomy without
preoperative therapy at the Department of Surgery, Ruijin
Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of
Medicine during 2014-2015. Tissues were made into tissue
microarray by Outdo Biotech Company, Shanghai, China.
Ethical approval was granted by the research medical
ethics committee of Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong
University School of Medicine.

(1:50), IgG antibody was stained as control. The tissues
were assigned blindly to two professional pathologists for
examination.
RIPA buffer containing Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(Pierce, USA) was purchased for lysing cells. Protein
concentration was measured by using BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Pierce, USA). Proteins extracted were
electrophoresed and electrotransfered. Antibody against
ABCG2 or CRKL (1:1000) and GAPDH (1:5000) were
probed, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody was prepared for further probe. GAPDH was
applied as loading control.

respectively cultured in 96-well microtiter plates in
triplicate and incubated for 5 days at 37°C with an
atmosphere of 5% CO2. OD was measured by WST
(Water-soluble tetrazolium salt USA) assay by using
CCK8 Assay Kit (Dojindo, Japan) according to the
protocol. The curves of cell proliferation were plotted.
RNaseA treatment and Propidium Iodide staining
were carried out. Cells were detected under flow
cytometry by FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, USA).
Cell populations at the G0/G1, S and G2/M phases were
quantified by Modfit software (Becton Dickinson, USA)
excluding a calculation of cell debris and fixation artifacts.

RNA isolation and qRT-PCR assay

Cell apoptosis analysis

Total RNA was extracted from cell lines by
using reagent (Invitrogen, USA) following the
manufactory instructions. The first-strand cDNAs were
synthesized through High-Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (ABI, USA). RT-primers of ABCG2
and CRKL were synthesized by Sangon Biotech
Company (Shanghai, China) as follow: 1) ABCG2:
5’-TGTGTTTATGATGGTCTGTTGGT-3’(forward) and
5’-CTGTGCAACAGTGTGATGGC-3’ (reverse); 2)
CRKL: 5’-CATTCCCGGGCGGCTCTCTC-3’ (forward)
and 5’-CACGCCTTAGCCCGGCAGAC-3’ (reverse).
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was carried out according to TagMan Gene
Expression Assays protocol (ABI, USA). The PCR
program was set as follows: 95°C for 10 min, followed by
32 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 45 s.

Cell apoptosis rate was calculated by using c
Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen, USA)
according to the product instructions. Stable transfected
MKN-45 cells were washed by PBS and resuspended in
1×Binging Buffer at a concentration of 1×106 cells/ml.
Five microliter of APC and 5μl of PI were added to 100μl
of cell suspension and incubated in dark for 15 min. Then
400μ1×Bingding Buffer was added. The apoptosis was
analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, USA)
and Annexin V-APC-positive and PI-negative cells were
considered apoptosis.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis for 72 specimens in Table 1
was carried out by SPSS 18.0 and GraphPad Prism 5.0.
P values were calculated by paired t-test and Fisher’s exact
text. Those P values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Cell transfection
We selected MKN-45 cells for further study
according to the results of western blot analysis. MKN45 cells were transfected with pGU6/Neovectors
(GenePhrma, Shanghai, China) containing siRNA against
ABCG2 by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA),
and non-containing ones were used as negative control.
Cells were cultured and selected in medium containing
400μg/ml G418 (Santa Cruz, USA), and were cultured and
maintained in medium containing 200μg/ml G418.
Recombinant adenovirus Ad5/F35 (Ad5/F35CRKL) was constructed for ectopically expressing CRKL
in MKN-45 cells to investigate the rescue effect on the
phenotypes caused by ABCG2 depletion (GenePhrma,
Shanghai, China). Ad5/F35-Null was used as negative
control. Stable transfected cells above were validated by
qRT-PCR and western blot analysis compared with the
negative control cells.
