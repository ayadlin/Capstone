Pemetrexed Indirectly Activates the Metabolic Kinase AMPK
in Human Carcinomas
Scott B. Rothbart, Alexandra C. Racanelli, and Richard G. Moran

Abstract
The chemotherapeutic drug pemetrexed, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, has an important secondary
target in human leukemic cells, aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (AICART), the
second folate-dependent enzyme of purine biosynthesis. The purine intermediate aminoimidazolecarboxamide
ribonucleotide (ZMP), which accumulates behind this block, transmits an inhibitory signal to the mTORC1
complex via activation of the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). Given that the PI3K-AKTmTOR pathway is frequently deregulated during carcinogenesis, we asked whether the indirect activation of
AMPK by pemetrexed offers an effective therapeutic strategy for carcinomas with defects in this pathway.
Activation of AMPK by ZMP in pemetrexed-treated colon and lung carcinoma cells and the downstream
consequences of this activation were strikingly more robust than previously seen in leukemic cells. Genetic
experiments demonstrated the intermediacy of AICART inhibition and the centrality of AMPK activation in
these effects. Whereas AMPK activation resulted in marked inhibition of mTORC1, other targets of AMPK were
phosphorylated that were not mTORC1-dependent. Whereas AMPK activation is thought to require AMPKa
T172 phosphorylation, pemetrexed also activated AMPK in carcinoma cells null for LKB1, the predominant
AMPKa T172 kinase whose deficiency is common in lung adenocarcinomas. Like rapamycin analogs,
pemetrexed relieved feedback suppression of PI3K and AKT, but the prolonged accumulation of unphosphorylated 4E-BP1, a tight-binding inhibitor of cap-dependent translation, was seen following AMPK activation.
Our findings indicate that AMPK activation by pemetrexed inhibits mTORC1-dependent and -independent
processes that control translation and lipid metabolism, identifying pemetrexed as a targeted therapeutic agent
for this pathway that differs significantly from rapamycin analogs. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10299–309. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Pemetrexed has shown substantial activity against lung
carcinomas not usually considered to be sensitive to classical
antifolates (1). The US Food and Drug Administration
approved pemetrexed for mesothelioma in 2004, for non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 2008, and, notably, for
maintenance therapy of NSCLC in 2009, the first drug ever
approved for this purpose (2–4). Pemetrexed and its metabolites were originally shown to be potent inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (TS; ref. 5), but it was clear from the start that
there was another target for pemetrexed that led to inhibition

of purine synthesis (5, 6). We recently discovered that this
elusive target was the second folate-dependent enzyme of de
novo purine synthesis, aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (AICART) in human leukemic cells
(7). Others have shown that intracellular pemetrexed is rapidly
converted to polyglutamate derivatives by folylpolyglutamate
synthetase (8); hence, we presume that inhibition of AICART
was brought about by the polyglutamate derivatives of pemetrexed. Inhibition of AICART results in the accumulation of
aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide (ZMP), an intermediate along the purine de novo biosynthesis pathway. ZMP
is a mimetic of AMP that also accumulates in cells following
exposure to aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleoside
(AICAR), with profound consequences (9, 10). We recently
demonstrated that the accumulation of ZMP in leukemic cells
treated with pemetrexed activates AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK), a protein that senses cellular energy charge
and links proliferative capacity to the availability of sufficient
ATP (7).
AMPK is composed of 3 subunits (a, b, and g). The AMPK
b-subunit is a scaffold for the assembly of the trimeric protein,
with the a-subunit responsible for the kinase activity and the
g-subunit modulating the catalytic activity of the a-subunit
(11). The g-subunit responds to energy charge due to the
cooperative binding of AMP at 2 sites competitive with ATP.

Enhanced binding of AMP to the g-subunit is seen as concentration rises through the mmol/L range, even in the presence of physiologic ATP concentrations (12). Activation of
AMPK is thought to require phosphorylation of AMPKa T172
(13–15). The tumor suppressor gene product LKB1 has been
shown to be the predominant AMPK kinase in most cell types
(16–18). T172 can also be phosphorylated by CAMKKb in the
presence of Caþ2 or a calcium ionophore, but absence of
AMP (19–21).
AMPK phosphorylates several controlling elements of lipid
and energy metabolism, and also phosphorylates 2 key proteins in the PI3Kinase-AKT-mTOR pathway (22, 23). Both
phosphorylation events lead to inhibition of the kinase activity
of the mTORC1 complex, causing suppression of the phosphorylation of 2 downstream targets, S6K1 and 4E-BP1, each
of which play a critical role in cap-dependent translation (24).
Phosphorylation of S6K1 activates its kinase activity, which
converts eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4B (eIF4B)
to its phosphorylated form, a necessary step in its recruitment
to the cap-dependent translational preinitiation complex. In
contrast, unphosphorylated 4E-BP1 tightly binds 50 -cap–
bound eIF4E, preventing the binding of eIF4G necessary for
assembly of the translational initiation complex. mTORC1phosphorylated 4E-BP1 does not bind to cap-eIF4E complexes. The control of mTOR-dependent processes is frequently deregulated during carcinogenesis due to mutation
of K-Ras, loss of PTEN, hyperactivity of PI3K, or loss of control
on AKT (25).
With the far-reaching effects of AMPK activation on processes essential for tumor cell-proliferation, it was apparent
that the secondary effect of pemetrexed might be instrumental
in the activity of this antifolate against lung cancers. In this
article, we demonstrate the endogenous accumulation of ZMP
to very high levels following the inhibition of de novo purine
synthesis by pemetrexed and the activation of AMPK by this
metabolite in a spectrum of human carcinoma cells, even in
cells with an LKB1-null phenotype. Importantly, the site in
purine synthesis targeted by pemetrexed was verified by
siRNA experiments and by the availability of human fibroblasts that are null for AICART. Overall, in human carcinomas,
these studies define pemetrexed as an AMPK activating agent,
and a TS inhibitor, with effects that include, but extend
beyond, inhibition of mTORC1.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
Cell lines were purchased from ATCC and maintained in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine
serum (dFBS). The phenotype of LKB1-null H460 and HeLa
cells was confirmed by Western blotting. AICART(/) skin
fibroblasts were a generous gift from Marie-Francoise Vincent
(Universite Catholique de Louvain) and were maintained in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15%
FBS; experiments were performed in dialyzed serum. Experiments were performed on the AICART(/) fibroblasts
within 2 passages after receipt. Pemetrexed disodium was
obtained from Eli Lilly and Co. Unless otherwise noted, cells

were treated with final concentrations of 1 mmol/L pemetrexed and 5.6 mmol/L thymidine. Cell proliferation experiments were evaluated by Coulter counting after 72 hours of
continuous drug exposure. GSK690693 was purchased from
SYN|thesis Med Chem and was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). All other culture reagents were obtained from Sigma
Aldrich.
ZMP measurements
Cell pellets were extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid and
ZMP levels were measured after neutralization by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using NH4H2PO4
gradient elution on a SAX 250  2.0 mm column (Phenomenex; ref. 7).
Immunoblotting
Total cellular protein was harvested and quantified as
previously described (7). Typically, 20 mg protein was resolved
on 5%, 7.5%, and 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membrane
(Millipore). AICART primary antibody was from BD Pharmingen. b-Actin primary antibody was from Abcam. All other
primary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology.
Chemiluminescence was detected using Super Signal Substrate kits (Pierce).
AMPK activity assay
AMPK activity was measured in AMPKa1 immunoprecipitates (IP) using the SAMS peptide (Tocris Bioscience) as
substrate (26). Cells were broken in cold lysis buffer (26)
and the protein content of the supernatant was determined
by Bradford assay. For each sample, a 10-mL bed volume of
protein-G sepharose (Amersham) was first washed 3 times
with IP buffer (26). Anti-AMPKa1 antibody (10 mg; Upstate)
was bound to equilibrated protein-G beads at 4 C. Antibodybound beads were washed 5 times with cold IP buffer and
incubated overnight with 100 mg lysate at 4 C. IPs were
washed with cold IP buffer containing 1 mol/L NaCl followed
by additional washes as described (26). IP was resuspended in
60 mL assay buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L
dithiolthreitol and 0.02% (v/v) Brij-35]. Typical reactions were
performed in 25 mL assay buffer containing 0.2 mmol/L SAMS
peptide, 0.2 mmol/L AMP, 0.2 mmol/L [g-32P]-ATP (final
specific activity 500 cpm/pmol), 5 mmol/L MgCl2, and
immunoprecipitated AMPKa1. Reactions were incubated at
37 C for 10 minutes and quenched by spotting onto Whatman
P81 disks. Disks were washed 2 times in 1% (v/v) phosphoric
acid, 1 time in water, and 1 time in acetone before being
counted in scintillation fluid.

m7GTP capture of 4E-BP1-eIF4E complexes
Following the indicated drug treatments, cells were lysed on
ice for 30 minutes in IP buffer [25 mmol/L of HEPES (pH 7.5),
1% NP40, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor Tablet]. An aliquot (500 mg) of cleared lysate
was incubated with 40 mL of a 50% slurry of m7GTP-Sepharose
(GE Lifesciences) for 2 hours at 4 C with rotation. m7GTP
captured complexes were washed with IP buffer 4 times,
resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5
minutes before being resolved on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel
and immunoblotted as described above.
Clonogenic survival
Cells were plated from a single cell suspension at 100 per 60mm dish and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then
treated continuously with media supplemented with 5.6
mmol/L thymidine containing 0 to 100 mmol/L combinations
of GSK690963 and pemetrexed for 72 hours. Plates were
washed with PBS, and fresh media supplemented with thymidine was added every 2 to 3 days and colonies were fixed
with methanol, stained with 5% Wright–Giemsa reagent, and
counted on day 8.

Results
AMPK is activated following ZMP accumulation in
pemetrexed-treated carcinoma cells
A striking inhibition of AICART was seen in a series of
human carcinoma cell types treated with pemetrexed, as

evidenced by the accumulation of the substrate for the
AICART reaction, ZMP (Table 1). Whereas cellular ZMP is
normally held below 1 mmol/L, it accumulated to levels of 1 to
12 mmol/L in different carcinoma cell types because of the
continuing operation of the pathway for purine biosynthesis in
the face of an AICART block. These experiments were performed in the presence of 5.6 mmol/L thymidine, a salvageable
source of thymidylate that prevented the effects of TS inhibition by pemetrexed. In contrast, treatment of HCT116 cells
with 1 mmol/L methotrexate in the presence of thymidine for
24 hours did not result in the accumulation of measurable
ZMP, indicating that this accumulation was not an unspecific
antifolate effect. The substantial levels of ZMP accumulating
in pemetrexed-treated HCT116 cells initiated a robust phosphorylation of T172 on the a-subunit of AMPK (Fig. 1A).
Activation of the kinase activity of AMPK, assayed in vitro
using the AMPK-specific SAMS peptide as a substrate, was
also detected in IPs from HCT116 cells using antibody against
the a1-subunit of AMPK, implying that a posttranslational
event, presumably T172 phosphorylation, was sufficient for
AMPK activation in the presence of AMP or ZMP (Fig. 1A).
AMPK activity was not measurable in a similar immunoprecipitation using an antibody specific for AMPKa2 (data not
shown).
The growth of HCT116 cells is potently inhibited by pemetrexed at low nmol/L concentrations (Fig. 1B), an effect due in
part to inhibition of TS (5). Exposure to drug in the presence of
thymidine, which prevents the effects of TS inhibition, shifts
the growth inhibitory effect of pemetrexed approximately 3fold (Fig. 1B). Hence, although the most sensitive folatedependent step in intact carcinoma cells is TS, the secondary
target in purine synthesis was affected even at the minimal
inhibitory concentrations of this drug. The concentrations of
pemetrexed that cause this accumulation of ZMP in vitro

Figure 1. AMPK activation by ZMP accumulating in pemetrexed-treated HCT116 cells. A, pemetrexed induces AMPK phosphorylation and activity.
HCT116 cells were treated with 1 mmol/L pemetrexed in the presence of 5.6 mmol/L thymidine to offset the effects of TS inhibition. The phosphorylation
of T172 on AMPKa was detected by Western blot (top), and the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated AMPKa1 was measured using SAMS peptide
as a substrate (bottom). B, the secondary growth-inhibitory mechanism of pemetrexed correlates with ZMP accumulation. HCT116 cells were treated
with pemetrexed for 72 hours in the absence (circles) or presence (open triangles) of thymidine. ZMP (closed triangles) was measured by HPLC following
15-hour exposure to pemetrexed and thymidine, and measured values in nmol/106 cells were converted to mmol/L concentrations in cell water.
C, siRNA knockdown (KD) of AICART mimics the effects of pemetrexed on AMPKa phosphorylation in HCT116 cells. D, accumulation of ZMP in
HCT116 cells transfected with a pool of siRNAs against AICART. HCT116 cells were transfected with Dharmacon smart pools of AICART or scrambled

4 hours immediately before harvest. *, values that were below the limits of the assay (<0.001 mmol/L). For details, see Materials and Methods.

(0.03–1 mmol/L; Fig. 1B) are maintained in serum of patients
treated with this drug for more than 48 hours (27). Accumulation of ZMP in HCT116 cells occurs over the same concentration range that causes a thymidine-insensitive growth
inhibition (Fig 1B), and phosphorylation of AMPKa T172,
likewise, incrementally increases over the same concentration
range of pemetrexed (data not shown).
When HCT116 cells were transfected with pools of siRNAs
directed against AICART, the effects of inhibition of the
secondary target of pemetrexed were recapitulated (Fig. 1C

and D), confirming the intermediacy of AICART inhibition in
the accumulation of ZMP and the activation of AMPK by
pemetrexed. Surprisingly, the effect of approximately 95%
knockdown of AICART on ZMP accumulation and AMPKa
T172 phosphorylation was less pronounced than that seen
following treatment with pemetrexed (Fig. 1A, C, and D). The
accumulation of ZMP in AICART knockdown cells exposed to
a low concentration of AICAR (100 mmol/L) indicated that the
flow of ZMP through AICART becomes restricted by siRNA
depletion of AICART (Fig. 1D), but ZMP accumulation even

under conditions of AICART knockdown plus AICAR challenge did not match that seen after pemetrexed treatment of
HCT116 cells. Hence, it appears that AICART activity is in
excess and not rate-limiting to the flux through the purine
synthesis pathway in uninhibited cells and that inhibition of
AICART by pemetrexed is quite extensive in intact cells.
A patient was reported who had inactivating mutations in
both alleles of the AICART gene and, hence, complete deficiency of this enzyme (28). In skin fibroblasts from this patient
[AICART(/) human skin fibroblasts], a more than 1,000fold increase in ZMP was detected compared with levels in
WI-38 human lung fibroblasts (Table 2), phenocopying the
effect of pemetrexed.

Inhibition of mTORC1 by pemetrexed is dependent on
the activity of AMPK
AMPK inhibits mTORC1 both by a mechanism involving
direct phosphorylation of Raptor and indirectly through
phosphorylation of the TSC2 component of the tuberous
sclerosis complex (22, 23). The phosphorylation of AMPK in
response to pemetrexed resulted in a striking hyperphosphorylation of Raptor at S792 and hypophosphorylation of T389 of
the downstream target of mTORC1, S6K1 (Fig. 2A). The
competitive inhibitor of the AMPKa ATP-binding site, compound C (29), blocked the hypophosphorylation of S6K1 at
T389 induced by pemetrexed (Fig. 2B). Likewise, siRNA against
the a1-subunit of AMPK blocked the hypophosphorylation of
S6K1 and hyperphosphorylation of Raptor in spite of the
continued accumulation of ZMP in HCT116 cells (Fig. 2C;

Table 3). This AMPKa1-specific siRNA pool depleted all
AMPKa detectable on immunoblots probed with an antibody
that detected both AMPKa1 and a2, indicating that AMPKa2
was not expressed in HCT116 cells. We concluded that the
pemetrexed-induced accumulation of ZMP behind an AICART
block activated AMPK, signaling downstream to inhibit the
activity of the mTORC1 complex.
The secondary effects of pemetrexed are not identical
to those of rapamycin
Growth inhibition from an AICART block by pemetrexed
was determined across a panel of carcinoma cell lines, many of
which had mutations in key controlling elements along the
PI3Kinase-AKT-mTOR signaling axis (Fig. 3A). All 10 cell lines
tested were sensitive to the secondary effect of pemetrexed,

albeit to varying degrees. The sensitivity did not correlate with
the level of ZMP measured in these cells (Table 1; Fig. 3A),
suggesting that other factors, either biochemical or genetic,
contribute to this variability. Notably, the sensitivity of these
cell lines to pemetrexed and to a concentration of rapamycin
that would cause complete and prolonged inhibition of
mTORC1 (25 nmol/L) were not identical nor even correlated,
with most cell lines demonstrating higher sensitivity to the
AMPK activation by pemetrexed than to direct inhibition of
mTOR (Fig. 3A). We note that the cell lines most sensitive to
pemetrexed in our limited screen, HCT116 and H460, harbor
activating mutations in both PI3Kinase and K-Ras. Interestingly, the HCT116 cell was among the least sensitive to growth
inhibition by rapamycin, but the most sensitive to the secondary effect of pemetrexed. We concluded that the secondary
effects of pemetrexed causing growth inhibition were because
of the downstream signaling from activated AMPK rather than
solely to inhibition of mTORC1.

LKB1 is not required for AMPK activation in response
to pemetrexed
Loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene
product LKB1, the major upstream kinase of AMPK, is a
common occurrence in primary non–small cell lung carcinomas (30). We, therefore, sought to determine whether the
effects of pemetrexed on AMPK signaling remained intact in
carcinoma cells lacking LKB1. Human H460 NSCLC and HeLa
cervical carcinoma cell lines do not express functional LKB1
(Fig. 3B); H460 has a premature stop at codon 37 (31) and
there is biallelic deletion of LKB1 in HeLa (32). In spite of these
defects in LKB1 expression, the growth of H460 and HeLa is
inhibited by pemetrexed in the presence of thymidine, albeit
somewhat less potently than HCT116 (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of
mTORC1 signaling in response to pemetrexed was also seen in
both H460 and HeLa cells, as indicated by S6K1 T389 hypophosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Compound C blocked the initial hypophosphorylation of S6K1 at T389 in H460 cells (Fig. 3D), again
suggesting that mTORC1 inhibition induced by pemetrexed
was mediated by increased AMPK activity; interestingly,
compound C by itself also diminished S6K1 phosphorylation.

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

In LKB1-null cells, enhanced phosphorylation of AMPKa at
T172 was not always a clear indicator of AMPK activity. Thus,
in H460 cells, pemetrexed stimulation of AMPKa T172 phosphorylation was not detected, primarily because this residue
was already hyperphosphorylated in untreated cells (Fig. 3E).
However, several observations support the concept that
AMPK was activated in H460 cells by pemetrexed: (1) the
direct AMPK target acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) was hyperphosphorylated at S79 in pemetrexed-treated H460 cells; (2)
eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), the substrate for the
direct AMPK target eEF2 kinase, was also hyperphosphorylated at T56 after pemetrexed treatment, (Fig. 3E and F); and
(3) S6K1 was hypophosphorylated at T389 (Fig. 3C). The
inactivity of AMPK that was extensively phosphorylated at
T172 in untreated H460 cells led to the conclusion that T172
phosphorylation was necessary but not sufficient for AMPK
activation in these cells, and that such activation only
occurred following the accumulation of ZMP either after
pemetrexed or AICAR treatment (Fig. 3E and F). Interestingly,
a marked hyperphosphorylation of both ACC at S79 and eEF2
at T56 was seen in untreated HCT116 cells that had hypophosphorylated AMPK.

exposure showed that, after an initial delay of a few hours,
ZMP accumulated at a rate of 0.2 mmol/L/hour up to 15
hours, and then remained elevated for at least 48 hours in
HCT116 cells (Fig. 4A). AMPKa became hyperphosphorylated
at T172 by 15 hours and this phosphorylation persisted for an
interval coincident with expansion of the ZMP pool. It
appeared that the presence of the expanded ZMP pool was
sufficient to trigger AMPKa phosphorylation (Fig. 4A).
The time course of pemetrexed effects on 4E-BP1 and S6K1
phosphorylation (Fig. 4B and C, respectively) was followed.
Inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation peaked by 15 hours, but
recovered slowly, as indicated by Western blots probed with
phospho-specific antibody and, particularly, by a pan 4E-BP1
antibody (Fig. 4B). Although only a very low percentage of this
protein ran at the position of p-4E-BP1 (pan 4E-BP1 blot, Fig.
4B), there was a substantial expansion of the cellular content
of unphosphorylated 4E-BP1 after pemetrexed treatment in
HCT116 cells. Because unphosphorylated 4E-BP1 is known to
tightly bind to eIF4E-capped mRNA complexes, preventing the
binding of eIF4G and the initiation of cap-dependent translation, we measured the binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E-cap complexes in extracts of pemetrexed-treated cells. The binding of
4E-BP1 to eIF4E-bound 7-methylGTP-beads was enhanced by
pemetrexed and was maintained for at least 24 hours after
treatment (Fig. 4B), indicating a prolonged presence of active
inhibitor of cap-dependent translation. In contrast, the binding of 4E-BP1 to cap complexes promoted by rapamycin was
less than seen with pemetrexed and diminished at longer
times (12 hours) after treatment (Fig. 4B), as previously shown
by others (33).
S6K1 phosphorylation was initially inhibited by 15 hours
after pemetrexed treatment, but hypophosphorylation of S6K1

was transient and partially recovered by 48 hours (Fig. 4C).
The recovery of S6K1 phosphorylation occurred in spite of
continued phosphorylation of AMPKa T172 and expansion of
the ZMP pool (Fig. 4A), suggesting that an event that was
dominant over continued AMPK activity was being activated.
As in HCT116 cells, hypophosphorylation of S6K1 was transient in H460, peaking at 15 to 24 hours and partially recovering by 48 hours, suggesting that the recovery of mTORC1
signaling also occurred in cells that lack LKB1 (Fig. 4C).
We sought to determine whether the slow recovery of S6K1
phosphorylation following pemetrexed was caused by relief of
feedback suppression of PI3K and AKT via stabilization of
insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and stimulation of
mTORC2 with subsequent AKT S473 phosphorylation, as
has been seen with rapamycin analogs (34, 35). The phosphorylation and stability of IRS-1 was determined with an antibody
directed against total IRS-1 protein. An increased level of IRS-1
was measured (Fig. 4D), presumably signifying expression and
stabilization of this protein (36, 37). An enhanced phosphorylation of AKT on S473 was also observed coincident with
recovery of pemetrexed-mediated inhibition of S6K1 in
HCT116 cells (Fig. 4C and D). Therefore, it appeared that
the partial recovery of S6K1 T389 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C)
was a result of enhanced AKT activity, at least partially
reactivating mTORC1. In support of this mechanism, treatment of HCT116 cells with the pan-AKT competitive inhibitor
GSK690693 prolonged the inhibitory effect of pemetrexed on
S6K1 T389 phosphorylation (Fig. 4E). Colony formation
experiments with this combination indicated that the cytotoxicity of inhibition of AICART by pemetrexed was synergistically enhanced by exposure to the AKT inhibitor (Fig. 4F),
with noncytotoxic concentrations of pemetrexed plus thymidine increasing the cell kill seen with 10 or 32 mmol/L
GSK690693 (Fig. 4F).

Discussion
Cellular requirements for AMPK activation
ZMP or AMP binding to the AMPKg subunit is thought to
allosterically stimulate the kinase activity of the a-subunit
both directly through conformational restraint of an autoinhibitory peptide on the a-subunit and by protecting T172 in
the a-subunit from dephosphorylation (13–15). Following
pemetrexed-mediated ZMP accumulation in HCT116 cells,
T172 is maintained in a phosphorylated state and the kinase
is activated toward some targets, for example, Raptor. Of note,
AMPK activity was easily measurable in IPs of untreated
HCT116 cells (Fig. 1A), and the mTORC1-independent targets
of AMPK, ACC, and eEF2, were hyperphosphorylated in the
absence of detectable T172 phosphorylation or an expanded
ZMP pool in HCT116 (Fig 3E and F). The phosphorylation of
ACC in cells with hypophosphorylated AMPK has also been
recently observed by others (38). The mechanism of the
differential phosphorylation of mTORC1-independent targets
ACC and eEF2 and of mTORC1-related AMPK targets in
HCT116 cells remains to be elucidated.
One of the more interesting aspects of our results is that the
accumulation of ZMP induced by pemetrexed stimulates

www.aacrjournals.org

AMPK activity in cells that have lost LKB1 function, in spite
of the fact that the experimental support for LKB1 as the
principal kinase for AMPKa T172 phosphorylation is strong
(16, 17, 39). In H460 cells, the AMPKa subunit is hyperphosphorylated at T172 under basal conditions by a kinase other
than LKB1. However, AMPK is not catalytically active under
these conditions and becomes active only after accumulation
of ZMP. These data support previous conclusions that T172
phosphorylation alone is insufficient to fully activate the
kinase activity of AMPKa (13–15), at least toward the substrates Raptor and TSC2.
Opposing influences of AMPK and AKT on mTORC1
Whereas AMPK inhibits mTORC1 through phosphorylation
of TSC2 and the Raptor subunit of mTORC1, AKT opposes
each of these effects. AKT indirectly inhibits the GTPase
activity of the mTORC1 effector Rheb (40–42), likely through
phosphorylation of multiple residues including S939 and
T1462 on the human TSC2 subunit (43, 44), whereas AMPK
phosphorylation of TSC2 S1387 and T1271 are requisite for
mTORC1 inhibition in response to energy stress (23). AKT also
activates mTORC1 by phosphorylating the PRAS40 subunit of
mTORC1 at T246, promoting the dissociation of inhibitory
PRAS40 from mTORC1 (45, 46), whereas the phosphorylation
of Raptor S792 by AMPK results in inhibition of the kinase
activity of mTORC1 (22). A question of some significance is
whether the effect of AMPK or that of AKT would dominate at
each of these 2 nodes of signal integration. We show that, in
spite of continued activation of AMPK in response to pemetrexed, the inhibition of S6K1 phosphorylation is partially
relieved, apparently by activation of the opposing influences
of AKT on TSC2 and mTORC1. The recovery of 4E-BP1
phosphorylation was less marked, and was dwarfed by the
marked accumulation of unphosphorylated 4E-BP1, the tightbinding inhibitor of an early step in initiation of cap-dependent translation, recruitment of eIF4G to the cap-bound eIF4E
complex. In the presence of this expanded pool of unphosphorylated 4E-BP1, binding of 4E-BP1 to cap-eIF4E complexes is maintained in pemetrexed-treated cells even after
rebound activation of AKT. Others have reported that the
stimulation of AKT activity following rapamycin did not
prevent suppression of S6K1 phosphorylation nor did it
interfere with growth suppression by everolimus (35, 47).
We note that the relief of feedback induced stimulation of
AKT after pemetrexed treatment also did not prevent complete growth suppression of HCT116 cells, presumably due to
either the continued inhibition of translational initiation by
the expanded pools of unphosphorylated 4E-BP1 (Fig 4B) or to
non-mTORC1–dependent effects of AMPK activation, for
example, inhibition of translational elongation by phosphorylation of eEF2 (Fig 3F).
AMPK activators and direct inhibitors of mTOR
A direct inhibitor of mTOR such as rapamycin, binds to a
site adjacent to the kinase domain of mTORC1 as a complex
with FKBP12 (48). In contrast, activators of AMPK inhibit
mTORC1 by phosphorylation events on Raptor and on the
TSC2 subunit of the tuberous sclerosis complex (22, 23).

Rothbart et al.

Pemetrexed-induced accumulation of ZMP does not appear to
inhibit the mTORC2 complex, as judged by the enhanced
phosphorylation of AKT seen in Figure 4D. Although most
agents identified to activate AMPK seem to promote AMPK
activation through their ATP-depleting effects (49), it is
important to note that pemetrexed does not cause ATP
depletion (7, 50).
A number of other targets are controlled by AMPK that are
not mediated by mTORC1 (11). Indeed, we show that ACC
phosphorylation is induced by AMPK activation in H460 cells,
as is phosphorylation of eEF2 (Fig. 3E and F), both of which are
direct targets for AMPK whose phosphorylation is not
mediated by mTORC1 (51). It would be expected that pemetrexed-induced activation of AMPK would also affect other
direct targets of this kinase, and that the overall effects of
AICART inhibition would have components additional to the
effects seen with rapamycin analogs. Likewise, activation of
AMPK by pemetrexed and inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin
were not equivalent against a spectrum of cell lines (Fig. 3A).
Whether AMPK activation offers a therapeutic advantage over
direct mTOR inhibitors remains an open question.
In this article, we present the argument that activation of
AMPK by ZMP accumulation following inhibition of AICART
poses a viable therapeutic intervention to prevent aberrant
proliferation in tumors with genetic defects in the PI3Kinase-

AKT-mTOR pathway. Although downstream effects on
mTORC1 are involved in pemetrexed action, the spectrum
of effects is not confined to mTORC1-dependent processes,
and AICART inhibitors represent a unique class of drugs
different from the rapamycin analogs.
