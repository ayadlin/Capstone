ABSTRACT
Progression from early forms of prostate cancer to castration-resistant disease is
associated with an increase in signal transduction activity. The majority of castrationresistance cancers persist in the expression of the androgen receptor (AR), as well
as androgen-dependent genes. The AR is regulated not only by it associated steroid
hormone, but also by manifold regulatory and signaling molecules, including several
kinases. We undertook evaluation of the role of Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 (LMTK2) in
modulating AR activity, as several Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have
shown a marked association of LMTK2 activity with the development of prostate
cancer. We confirm that not only is LMTK2 mRNA reduced in prostate cancer tissue,
but also LMTK2 protein levels are markedly diminished. Knockdown of LMTK2 protein
in prostate cell lines greatly increased the transcription of androgen-responsive
genes. In addition, LMTK2 knockdown led to an increase in prostate cancer stem cell
populations in LNCaP cells, indicative of increased tumorogenicity. Using multiple
approaches, we also demonstrate that LMTK2 interacts with the AR, thus putting
LMTK2 as a component of a signaling complex modulating AR activity. Our finding
that LMTK2 is a negative regulator of AR activity defines a novel cellular pathway for
activation of AR-responsive genes in castrate resistant-prostate cancer. Moreover,
pharmacologic manipulation of LMTK2 activity will provide a novel therapeutic target
for more effective treatments for patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer.

who develop prostate cancer receive AR antagonists, to
inhibit the actions of androgens on proliferation of prostate
epithelia [8, 9]. These therapies although effective in
initial stages, quickly loose their benefit, as most patients
eventually develop a castrate resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC), a devastating though poorly understood disease
state [10–13]. Studies using xenograft prostate tumors
that recur following androgen ablation therapy show
that although CRPC is insensitive to further androgen
depletion treatment, the tissue still expresses AR regulated
genes, suggesting that AR signaling pathways are still
intact in CRPC [14, 15].
Kinase-signaling pathways have been implicated in
the regulation and modulation of nuclear receptor activity
[16, 17], [18–20]. However, the signaling mechanisms
through which kinases modulate AR function are not well
understood. Stress kinase signaling is known to regulate

INTRODUCTION
The androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-dependent
nuclear receptor, plays a critical role in prenatal
development of the prostate [1–3]. For example, work by
wilkins and colleagues in 1950 showed that individuals
with complete androgen insensitivity, caused by AR
inactivating mutations, do not develop a prostate gland.
Likewise, AR knockout mice show a lack of prostate gland
development [4]. Even in adult males, the AR continues
to support the survival of secretory prostate epithelia, the
primary cell type argued to be transformed in prostate
adenocarcinoma [5, 6]. Prostate cancer is the second
leading cause of cancer related death amongst men in the
united states, with some 233,000 individuals diagnosed
with prostate cancer in 2014 alone, of which ~30,000 died
as a consequence of the disease [7]. Many of the patients

regulates its activity. Furthermore, a decrease in LMTK2
protein expression, as proposed in prostate cancer, not only
results in an increase in androgen mediated AR activity
but also increases the androgen-independent activity of
AR. Moreover, LMTK2-Knock Down (KD) in prostate
cancer cells results in an increase in cell viability and
tumorogenecity in the presence and absence of androgen.
As such, our study takes observations made in genomic
studies and reveals LMTK2 as a novel regulator of AR in
prostate epithelium.

AR phosphorylation, increasing its rate of nuclear export
and proteasome-mediated degradation [21]. In contrast,
Protein Phosphatase 1C (PP1C) dephosphorylates
AR, leading to an increase in AR nuclear retention and
increased gene transcription [22]. Furthermore, the HER2/
ERBB3 kinase signal has been shown to stabilize AR
protein levels and optimize binding of the AR to promoter
regions of androgen-regulated genes [23]. Clearly,
dysregulation of kinase signaling pathways would impact
heavily on AR activity in CRPC [24].
Recent Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of
patients with prostate cancer have identified a genetic variant
of Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 (LMTK2) (also called BREK/
KPI-2/CRPK/AATYK2), a membrane associated kinase
(Fig. 1A) [25, 26], [27, 28] to be strongly associated
with prostate cancer (P < 0.0001) [29–32]. Furthermore,
this genetic variant of LMTK2 has a Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism (SNP) in intron 9, causing decrease in
LMTK2 mRNA levels [29]. These studies suggest that
LMTK2 might be involved in the development and/or
maintenance of prostate gland tumors. However, due to
limited understanding of LMTK2 function [33, 34], its role
in prostate cancer still remains unknown. Recently, LMTK2
has been reported to interact with PP1C (Fig. 1B) and inhibit
its activity in CNS [35, 36]. Since, PP1C plays an important
role in nuclear retention of AR by dephosphorylating AR,
it is likely that decreased LMTK2 protein and/or activity
would result in an increase in AR activity and sensitivity to
androgens, events precisely observed in CRPC.
In summary, the results in this manuscript argue
that LMTK2 interacts directly with AR and negatively

RESULTS
LMTK2 expression and localization
Given GWAS linking LMTK2 expression
levels with prostate cancer, we initially determined if
LMTK2 was expressed in prostate epithelia. We used
a model cell line HEK293 as well as prostate cancer
cell lines i.e. PTN1A, PC3 and LNCaP for the same.
As predicted, immunoblot analysis showed robust
endogenous expression of LMTK2 in prostate epithelial
and HEK293 cells, which appeared as a single dominant
band of ~210 kDa (Fig. 2A), consistent with previously
published data [26]. In addition, we confirmed that the
observation were not an artifact of cell lines by studying
Lmtk2 expression in mouse primary prostate epithelial
cells. Mouse primary prostate epithelial cells not only
showed robust expression of Cytokeratin 5/8 (prostate
epithelial cell marker) and AR as expected, but also
Lmtk2 (Fig. 2B).

Furthermore, several studies have showed LMTK2
to be an endosome membrane-anchored protein [26, 34].
Hence, a reasonable expectation was that LMTK2 would
be localized in the extra-nuclear membrane fraction of
prostate cancer cells. Surprisingly, our confocal images
showed both nuclear as well as non-nuclear staining for
LMTK2 in prostate cancer cells (Fig. 2C). We further
confirmed this finding using subcellular fractionation,
to enrich a nuclear fraction, which too showed presence
of LMTK2 in nuclear and non-nuclear compartment of
prostate cancer cells, irrespective of its androgen exposure

(Fig. 2D). AR translocation, as reported in previous
studies [37] was also seen in the fractionation analysis.

LMTK2 is down regulated in human prostate
cancer
Previous studies have suggested that reduced
LMTK2 mRNA levels are associated with prostate cancer,
however whether this translates to altered protein levels
has not been determined. Immunostaining analysis of a

Fig. 4D shows representative figure where AR and LMTK2
appear to co-localize in the glandular prostate epithelial
cells. Results obtained from human prostate cancer cell
and tissue model together shows that AR and LMTK2 are
binding partners suggesting a functional significance of
LMTK2 in AR-axis.

prostate cancer (n = 48), prostate hyperplasia (n = 8) and
normal prostate tissue (n = 14) from a total of 20 individual
patients, revealed a marked difference in LMTK2 protein
expression levels (Supplementary Table 2). LMTK2
intensity was determined using Image-J software and
assigned arbitrary unit, which was binned as no (0), low
(0–20), medium (20–40), high (40–80) and very high
(80–170). A majority, >65% of normal prostate tissue had
very high expression of LMTK2, around 13% and 25%
of hyperplasia tissue had respectively very high or high
expression of LMTK2. In contrast, >67% of tumor tissue
contained undetectable or low levels of LMTK2 (Fig. 3A,
3C and 3D). The statistical significance of apparent
differences in LMTK2 expression between normal, and
prostate cancer was investigated by Mann-Whitney-U
analysis for pairwise comparison, which revealed a strong
association (P ≤ 0.001) between a decrease in LMTK2
protein expression and prostate cancer (Fig. 3B).

LMTK2 inhibits AR transcriptional activity
Our study shows that a decrease in LMTK2
expression is associated with human prostate cancer
and that LMTK2 and AR are binding partners in prostate
epithelial cells. These results prompted us to examine
the potential role for LMTK2 in AR-mediated signaling.
For this purpose, we created HEK293 cells stably
expressing either shRNA against LMTK2, control shRNA
(scrambled sequence) or an LMTK2 over-expression
plasmid. We also created stable LNCaP cells expressing
either shRNA against LMTK2 (LNCaP-KD cells) or
control shRNA (LNCaP-Control cells). Knock down
or overexpression of LMTK2 in these cell lines was
confirmed using immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5A & 5B).
To measure the affects of manipulating LMTK2 level on
the androgen receptor activity we used a dual luciferase
assay. Overexpression of LMTK2 in HEK293 cells
expressing AR, decreased androgen-dependent activation
of a luciferase reporter gene by two fold compared to
parental cells expressing AR; no activation was observed
in HEK293 cells without AR. In contrast, knock down
of LMTK2 in HEK293 cells expressing AR (analogous
to prostate cancer cells) enhanced androgen-dependent
activation of reporter gene by three fold in comparison
to parental cells and by six fold in comparison to cells
overexpressing LMTK2 (Fig. 5C). Constitutively active
renillia luciferase was used as transfection control.
To study the affects of LMTK2 on the expression
of endogeneous AR regulated genes, we measured the
expression of PSA, a prototypical AR regulated gene [39].
Consistent with the luciferase assay in HEK293 cells,
there was a dramatic increase in activation of endogenous
AR in LNCaP-KD cells in comparison to LNCaP-Control
as measured by secreted and total PSA (Fig. 5D).

LMTK2 and AR interact in prostate cancer
epithelial cells and co-localizes in human
prostate tissue
We had initially hypothesized that LMTK2 might
negatively regulate AR-dependent transcriptional activity.
Hence, we asked whether LMTK2 and AR are binding
partners in prostate epithelial cells. Protein complexes
immunoprecipitated with AR antibody from whole cell
lysate of LNCaP cells indicated the presence of LMTK2
(Fig. 4C). The specificity of LMTK2 and AR interaction
was shown by absence of LMTK2 when AR antibody was
replaced by IgG (Fig. 4C). AR pull down was confirmed
by blotting with separate AR antibody (AR-N20)
(Fig. 4C). However, in the reciprocal Co-IP experiment,
LMTK2 antibody failed to pull down AR, this might be
due to LMTK2 antibody interfering with the binding site
to the AR.
In addition, a Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA), a
means of assessing protein-protein interaction in situ, was
used to verify CO-IP findings [38]. LMTK2/AR complexes
were labeled using antibodies directed against LMTK2
and AR in LNCaP cells deprived of androgen or grown
in the presence of synthetic androgen (R1881, 2.5 nM).
Significantly higher numbers of LMTK2/AR protein
complexes were detected in prostate epithelial cells in
comparison to negative control (BAX/CFTR complexes),
two known non-interacting protein (Fig. 4A and 4B).
While under androgen deprivation the distribution of the
LMTK2/AR complexes was predominantly extra-nuclear
but in presence of androgens, they also localized within
the nuclear space.
To rule out cell line artifact, we further explored
possible interaction of the AR and LMTK2 in human
prostate tissue using co-localization analysis. 16 normal
prostate tissue samples were tested using immunostaining

Decrease in LMTK2 expression increases basal
AR activity
Since, the AR is active in CRPC and is able to
transcribe AR-dependent genes either in the presence of
low levels of androgens or absence of androgens [40],
we determined if a decrease in LMTK2 is involved in
activating AR in androgen deprived prostate cancer cells.
Thus, we compared the expression of AR responsive
genes between LNCaP-KD and LNCaP-Control cells
deprived of androgens for 72 hours. LMTK2-KD cells

was expressed in androgen dependent as well as androgen
independent prostate cancer epithelial cells, it is likely
that function of LMTK2 is not just limited to AR axis
and certainly previous studies have shown LMTK2 to
be an important binding partner of myosin VI involved
in endocytic trafficking pathways in prostate cancer cells
[33]. Furthermore, this report proposes a novel function
for LMTK2, as a negative regulator of AR transcription.
It was surprising to find LMTK2 to be localized
in a nuclear fraction of prostate cancer cells as previous
studies have suggested LMTK2 to be an endosomalmembrane associated kinase [26, 34] though none looked
specifically for nuclear localization. Using a Nuclear
Localization Signal (NLS) prediction tool [44–46] and
Nuclear Exit Signal (NES) prediction tool [47], we predict
2 possible bipartite NLS signal and a N-terminal NES
signal in LMTK2 (Fig. 2E), however these sites remain
to be confirmed experimentally. Hence, we speculate
that LMTK2 might be involved in retrograde endocytic
transport of proteins i.e. from cytoplasmic fraction to
nuclear fraction. Furthermore, LMTK2 immunostaining
and duolink data in this report indicates a nuclear
translocation of LMTK2/AR complexes in response to
androgen treatment of prostate cancer cells. Together,
these data suggests that LMTK2 may be involved in the
activation and translocation of AR. This phenomenon
of an endosomal membrane protein localized in nuclear
fractions is not unique to LMTK2. For example, FAM21,
a WASH complex subunit residing in early endosome
membrane like LMTK2 has been shown to undergo nuclear
translocation and participate in NF-kB-depenent gene
regulation in pancreatic cancer cells [48, 49]. Similarly,
tachykinin NK3 receptor (NK3R), a multi-pass membrane
protein belonging to G-protein receptor-1 class undergoes
nuclear translocation via importin pathway [50, 51].
The majority of prostate cancers (PCa) and Castrate
Resistant Prostate Cancers (CRPC) have functional AR,
which continues to drive the expression of AR-dependent
cell proliferative genes and hence the tumor growth despite
of low level of systemic androgens [52, 53]. Our report
shows that LMTK2 is an essential negative regulator of AR
transcriptional activity and knocking down its expression
in prostate cancer cells leads to significant increase in the
AR activity and also an increase in tumorogenecity and
cell viability. In contrast, overexpressing LMTK2 leads to
repression of AR activity. Hence, it can be deduced that a
decrease in LMTK2 expression observed in prostate cancer
patient promotes tumor cells proliferation by enhancing
AR transcriptional activity.
One of the most important outcomes from this
report was the role of LMTK2 in CRPC. Kinases play an
important role in driving AR activity in CRPC either by
direct activation of AR or by increasing its sensitivity
to low level of androgens. FKBP51, an AR-dependent
gene, which is also a positive regulator of AR activity,

LMTK2 down-regulation promotes tumor
forming capacity and proliferation in
LNCaP cells
In order to better understand the physiological role
of LMTK2 in prostate cancer, we investigated the effect of
LMTK2 on the tumor forming capacity and cell viability
of LNCaP cells, using a tumorsphere assay [41] and a cell
viability assay. Tumorspheres are enriched in cancer stem
cells [42], which are argued to be tumor-initiating cells
and are believed to play an enabling role in development
of CRPC [43]. LNCaP-KD cells showed significantly
higher colony-forming capacity by forming ~5 times more
clones compared to LNCaP control cells in tumorsphere
assay (Fig. 6A & 6B). We further tested the effects of a
decrease in LMTK2 expression on prostate cancer cell
viability using the ATP-Glo Bioluminometric cell viability
assay (Biotium, CA). LNCaP-KD cells, as expected,
showed ~5 times higher cell viability under androgen
starvation and ~2.5 times in presence of androgen when
compared to LNCaP-control cells (Fig. 6C). It is important
to note that while LNCaP-control cells treated with DMSO
after 3 days of androgen starvation showed decrease in
cell viability, there was no such decrease observed in
LNCaP-KD cells.

DISCUSSION
Recently, several Genome Wide Association
Studies (GWAS) involving prostate cancer patients of
Caucasian and East Asian descent identified a genetic
variant (SNP rs6465657) of Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2
(LMTK2), leading to decrease in its mRNA expression,
to be associated with prostate cancer [29–32]. However,
no information is available in terms of protein expression
or function of LMTK2 in prostate epithelial cells. In this
report, we compared protein expression of LMTK2 in
human prostate cancer tissue specimens with normal,
hyperplasia and prostate tissue specimens. Our data
shows that loss of LMTK2 protein is strongly associated
with prostate cancer and prostate hyperplasia, disease
states marked by dysregulation of AR. Since, we did
not genotype prostate cancer tissues it remains to be
determined if SNP rs6465657 associated with prostate
cancer results in decrease in LMTK2 protein expression.
Furthermore, we also show a high-level expression of
LMTK2 in normal prostate epithelial cells (PNT1A),
androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer cells
(PC3), androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells (LNCaP)
and mouse primary prostate epithelial cells. Since, LMTK2

is expressed two fold higher in CRPC compared with
primary tumors [54]. Data in this paper shows that
decreasing LMTK2 expression in prostate cancer cells
deprived of androgen results in significantly higher
levels of FKBP51 protein as well as increased mRNA
levels of AR-dependent genes (KLK2, S100P, TMPRS22
and PSA). These results provided strong circumstantial
evidence of a role for LMTK2 in pathogenesis and
progression of prostate cancer to castrate resistant stage.
In addition, cell viability data showed the strongest
role of decrease in LMTK2 in regards to androgenindependent growth in prostate cancer cells, androgendependent growth was also affected, although to a lesser
degree.
An important question that arises from our study
is the mechanism by which LMTK2 might be regulating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

AR transcription and cell proliferation in the absence of
exogenous androgen in prostate cancer cells. There are
several possible mechanisms that might be playing a role.
Firstly, LMTK2 has been shown to inactivate catalytic
activity of PP1, which plays an important role in nuclear
retention of AR by dephosphorylating at Ser-650. Hence
a decrease in LMTK2 protein express might result in
increase in PP1 activity leading to increased nuclear
retention and hence increased transcription activity.
Secondly, LMTK2 might be directly phosphorylating
AR and resulting in increased transcription activity in
absence or presence of exogenous androgen. Initial
evidence supporting this possibility comes from our study
where we show LMTK2 and AR to be binding partners
in prostate cancer cells. However, further experiments are
needed to support this hypothesis. And lastly, FKBP51,

14241

Oncotarget

an AR regulated gene is also known to positively regulate
AR transcriptional activity. Our study showed increase in
FKBP51 protein expression in LMTK2-KD prostate cancer
cells. Argument can be made that LMTK2 regulates AR
activity through FKBP51. Further experiments are clearly
needed to identify possible mechanism through which
LMTK2 augments AR transcription and cell proliferation
in prostate cancer cells.
In conclusion, our findings are the first evidence
that LMTK2 negatively regulates AR activity in prostate
cancer cells possibly by directly interacting with AR.
Furthermore, loss of LMTK2, associated with prostate
cancer can enhance AR transcriptional activity in absence
of androgen, suggesting role of LMTK2 in development of
CRPC. LMTK2 can now be considered negative regulator
of androgen-induced AR-mediated cell growth and
transcription. In terms of potential therapeutic target, small
molecules that enhance the activity of LMTK2 can decrease
AR-proliferative activity in patients with prostate cancer
and more importantly with castrate resistant prostate cancer.

nuclear proteins

MATERIALS and METHODS

LNCaP cells were starved of androgen for 3 days by
replacing complete media containing FBS with Charcoal
Stripped Fetal Bovine Serum (CSFBS). On day 3, cells
were treated either with DMSO or R1881 (Sigma-Aldrich)
as described in results. Nuclear and non-nuclear fractions
were separated as per manufacture’s recommendation
(GeneTex, Inc., Irvine, CA) and were probed for LMTK2
and AR using Immunoblot analyses. Anti-human GAPDH
antibody (SC-25778) was used for analyzing non-nuclear
fraction while Lamin-A (SC-20680) was used for nuclear
fraction.

Cell culture
The human cell lines, PNT1A (normal prostate
epithelial cells, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo) and LNCaP
(androgen sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma
cells, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI
1640 medium while PC3 (metastatic prostate cancer
cells isolated from bones, ATCC) were maintained in
F-12K medium. HEK293 (Female-Human Embryonic
Kidney Epithelial cells, ATCC) were cultured in
Advanced Dulbecco’s Medium. All culture medium
were supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) unless specified.

Co-immunoprecipitation and
immunoblot analyses
LNCaP cells were lysed in 1% NP-40 lysis
buffer and endogenous complexes of AR were
immunoprecipitated using mouse anti-AR 441 antibody.
Immunprecipitated complexes were then probed for
LMTK2 (rabbit anti-LMTK2) using immunoblot assay.
AR pull down was confirmed by blotting with rabbit
anti-AR N20 antibody. For immunoblot analyses samples
were prepared in 4× LDS sample buffer, resolved on
4–12% gradient Tris-Glycine Gel and transferred on to
polyvinyldiflouride (PVDF) membrane. Membranes were
probed for several proteins using human anti-AR, antiLMTK2, anti-β-ACTIN (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln,
NE) and anti-FKBP51 (ab-2901, ABCAM, Cambridge,
MA) antibodies. Proteins were detected and analyzed
using Odyssey Sa-Infrared imaging system™ (Li-COR
Biotechnology).

Plasmids and transfections
Wild type LMTK2 cloned in PCI vector was
provided as a gift by Dr. Takeshi Inoue, University
of Tokyo. Halo tagged Androgen Receptor construct
was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Plasmids
expressing and shRNA against human LMTK2 or control
shRNA were obtained from DNA 2.0 (Menlo Park, CA).
Transfections of cells were performed by 4D nucleofector
(Lonza Group Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction.

Prostate primary cell isolation
Male mice were euthanized at 8–12 week of age and
primary prostate epithelial cells were isolated as described

Tissue immunohistochemistry

Dual luciferase assay

Tissue arrays (BC19021a) obtained from USBiomax (Rockville, MD) containing normal, malignant
and metastatic human prostate tissue was used. The arrays
were probed for LMTK2 and AR using a Tyramide Signal
Amplification Kit (TSA, Invitrogen) as per manufacturer’s
recommendation.

Cells (1 × 105 per well in 96-well plates) were
co-transfected with Halo-AR and/or either AR reporter,
negative control or positive control in 2:1 ratio, supplied
with cignal androgen receptor reporter kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). Cells were grown in charcoal-stripped
media for 2 days and were treated with 1nm R1881 for
16 h. Luciferase activities were measured by using the
dual-luciferase reporter gene assay system (Promega,
Madison, WI) following the manufacturer’s instruction
in plate reader (POLARstar Omega, BMG Labtech,
Germany). Final results were normalized for transfection
efficiencies using the Renillia Luciferase Assay Value.
Luciferase assay were repeated for 3 times.

Proximity ligation assay
A Proximity Ligation Assay kit (Olink Bioscience,
Uppsala, Sweden) was used to study the interaction
between AR and LMTK2 in LNCaP cells [58]. Staining
procedure were carried out following the manufacturer’s
instructions using rabbit anti-LMTK2 and mouse anti-AR
antibodies to detect AR/LMTK2 interactions. BAX (Bcl2
associated protein-X) and CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Trans
membrane Conductance Regulator) are non-interacting
proteins, and hence rabbit anti-BAX (sc-493) and mouse
anti-CFTR (596, UNC at Chapel Hill, NC) were used as
negative control. The cellular PLA signal was visualized
using the Olympus IX71 inverted microscope as described
above and quantified using Image-J software [59].

Cell viability assays
1 × 105 cells were plated per well onto flat clear
bottom white polystyrene 96-well plate (Nunc) in RPMI
media supplemented with 10% CSFBS. Cells were treated
as discussed in the result section. Cell viability was
measured using ATP-GloTM Bioluminometric cell viability
assay kit (Biotium, CA.) according to manufacturer’s
instruction [63]. Each assay was performed in triplicate
and repeated 3 times (n = 3). Luminescence was measured
using POLARstar Omega.

Real-Time RT-PCR
Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells
using the Trizol RNA isolation reagent according to
manufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen). Complementary
DNA synthesis reactions were performed with 1 μg of
RNA using SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer instruction.
cDNA samples were amplified using SYBR® Green PCR
Master Mix on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Detection
System. Gene-specific forward and reverse primers
(Supplementary Table 1) used have been reported in
earlier studies [60, 61]. Furthermore, specificity and
efficiency for primers were analyzed by running qPCR
with series of cDNA dilutions and specific amplification
for every assay were confirmed by melt curve analysis.
All assays were run in duplicates and were repeated
3 times. The amplified transcripts were quantified using
the comparative ΔΔCt method.

Tumorigenicity assay
Cells were harvested and resulting pellet was
washed in PBS. 1 × 105 cells per well were plated onto
6-well Ultra-Low Attachment Plates (Corning, NY) in
Tumorsphere medium (PrEGM media with supplied
growth factors and supplements+1% N2 (Invitrogen) and
1% B27 (Invitrogen). After 7 days number of spheroids
(solid, rounded structures) were counted under light
microscope. Each experiment was carried out in triplicates.
