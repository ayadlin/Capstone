ABSTRACT
Approximately 5-10% of metastatic colorectal cancers harbor a BRAF-V600E
mutation, which is correlated with resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies and worse
clinical outcome. Vice versa, targeted inhibition of BRAF-V600E with the selective
inhibitor PLX 4032 (Vemurafenib) is severely limited due to feedback re-activation
of EGFR in these tumors. Mounting evidence indicates that upregulation of the ErbB3 signaling axis may occur in response to several targeted therapeutics, including
Vemurafenib, and NRG-1β-dependent re-activation of the PI3K/AKT survival pathway
has been associated with therapy resistance.
Here we show that colon CSCs express, next to EGFR and ErbB-2, also significant
amounts of ErbB-3 on their membrane. This expression is functional as NRG-1β
strongly induces AKT/PKB and ERK phosphorylation, cell proliferation, clonogenic
growth and promotes resistance to Vemurafenib in BRAF-V600E mutant colon CSCs.
This resistance was completely dependent on ErbB-3 expression, as evidenced
by knockdown of ErbB-3. More importantly, resistance could be alleviated with
therapeutic antibody blocking ErbB-3 activation, which impaired NRG-1β-driven AKT/
PKB and ERK activation, clonogenic growth in vitro and tumor growth in xenograft
models. In conclusion, our findings suggest that targeting ErbB-3 receptors could
represent an effective therapeutic approach in BRAF-V600E mutant colon cancer.

INTRODUCTION

[1]. The human ErbB receptor family, including EGFR
(ErbB-1/HER-1), ErbB-2 (HER-2), ErbB-3 (HER-3)
and ErbB-4 (HER-4) have been documented to play a
fundamental role in the development and progression of
several malignancies [2]. As a consequence, a multitude

Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for almost 10%
of all cancers and it is the third most common cancer
worldwide and still a major cause of cancer-related deaths

of targeted therapeutics have been developed to block the
activity of these receptors [3] and over the past decades the
development of EGFR targeted therapeutics has improved
the clinical outcome of metastatic CRC patients [4].
Despite these encouraging results, the reason why some
patients respond to treatment, while others don’t remains
poorly understood. Understanding the mechanism(s) of
resistance to EGFR targeted agents is therefore crucial
to gain a significant improvement in survival of CRC
patients.
Among the molecular pathways involved in CRC
progression and therapy resistance, the RAS-RAF-MEKERK axis plays a crucial role. Indeed, lack of response
to agents targeting EGFR in KRAS wild-type patients can
result from BRAF mutations at codon 600, which occur in
8-10% of metastatic CRC. Metastatic patients harboring
BRAF mutations display an extremely poor prognosis,
with a median survival of about 10 months [5, 6].
Therapies targeting mutated BRAF have been developed
and are currently used in specific malignancies. As an
example, Vemurafenib (PLX 4032), a small molecule
inhibiting specifically mutant BRAF-V600E, has been
successfully used in metastatic melanoma patients [7,
8]. However, no significant benefit from Vemurafenib
use has been observed in CRC patients [9]. In addition,
accumulating evidence suggests that, next to pathway
mutations, other receptor/ligand pairs may substitute the
loss of EGF/EGFR signaling and play a crucial role in
anti-EGFR therapy resistance. As an example, HGF/cMet activation has been suggested to result in resistance

to anti-EGFR based therapies [10]. In addition, it has been
shown that high expression of ErbB-3 correlates to worse
outcome in CRC [11, 12]. Moreover, NRG-1β, the ligand
for ErbB-3, is released by tumor-associated stromal cells
and has been suggested to promote CRC progression as
well as compensate for loss of EGF/EGFR signaling [13].
Here we analyzed the role of ErbB-3/NRG-1β
signaling on primary cultures derived from patients with
either mutant or wild-type BRAF-V600E CRC. These
primary cultures contain both cancer stem cells (CSCs)
and more differentiated cells and we observed that NRG1β sustains proliferation and cancer stemness in both wildtype and BRAF-V600E mutant CSCs by activating the
PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling axes. We also demonstrate
that NRG-1β, in addition to EGF, can effectively induce
escape from Vemurafenib therapy in BRAF-V600E mutant
colon CSC cultures. Finally, we show that targeting ErbB3 receptors in vivo, with a specific monoclonal antibody,
significantly delays tumor growth of BRAF-V600E mutant
colon cancer xenografts. Together, our data underline the
importance of NRG-1β in CRC stimulation and resistance
to BRAF-V600E targeted therapy.

of growth factors was strongly inhibited by the drug;
however this block was completely rescued by addition of
exogenous EGF, thus confirming the previously reported
role of EGFR signaling [14] in resistance to Vemurafenib.
This strong inhibition of growth by Vemurafenib
was confirmed using gene expression arrays, which
revealed that a total of ~400 genes were significantly
differentially expressed between controls and Vemurafenib
treated samples (Supplementary Figure 1A). Analysis
of the biological pathways affected indicated a strong
decrease in cell cycle/mitosis related genes in treated cells
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Since previous observations
suggested that EGFR activation counteracts Vemurafenibinduced growth arrest [14] we analyzed whether BRAF
inhibition had an effect on the expression of EGFR and its
close relatives (ErbB family). While no significant changes

in EGFR expression were observed between control and
Vemurafenib treated samples, we detected a significant
increase in the expression of ErbB-3 (Supplementary
Figure 1C). This was confirmed by western blotting for the
different receptors (Supplementary Figure 1D). Combined
this suggested that up-regulation of the expression of
this gene may constitute an escape mechanism from
Vemurafenib.

through ErbB-3 mediated PI3K/AKT activation [13].
To determine whether ErbB-3 could play a role in colon
CSC stimulation, we first analyzed ErbB receptors surface
expression in our panel of patient-derived colon CSCs.
Both wild-type and BRAF-V600E mutated cells expressed
EGFR, ErbB-2 and ErbB-3, but not ErbB-4 (Figure 2A).
We then investigated whether NRG-1β was able
to promote proliferation, clonogenicity and PI3K/AKT
activation in these cells. Interestingly, stimulation of wildtype and BRAF-V600E mutated cells with the ligand,
dose-dependently promoted cell proliferation. Similarly
to what was observed with other growth factors (EGF and
bFGF), this effect was more pronounced in wild-type cells
compared to those carrying the BRAF-V600E mutation
(Figure 2B). Of note, NRG-1β appeared to be as potent
as EGF in promoting cell proliferation when used alone

(Figure 2C).
To determine whether Vemurafenib-induced ErbB3 increase resulted in a potential escape mechanism, we
investigated whether activation of ErbB-3 by exogenous
NRG-1β could counteract the anti-proliferative effect of
Vemurafenib in BRAF-V600E mutated cells. To this end,
Co123 and CC09 cells were exposed to Vemurafenib in
the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of
NRG-1β. As shown in Figure 2D, we found that NRG1β dose-dependently reduced the inhibitory activity of
the BRAF inhibitor. Similar results were obtained in
clonogenic assays, indicating that NRG-1β ligand provides
an effective escape mechanism from blockage of BRAFV600E (Figure 2E).

assessed as described in Materials and Methods. A. Mice injected with CC09 (2.5 x 105) cells were divided in two groups one week after

Control groups were treated with PBS. Results are expressed as Relative Tumor Volume, p values were determined by Student’s t test and

ErbB-3 is required for Vemurafenib rescue
induced by exogenous NRG-1β

mortality, compared to those with tumors with wild-type
BRAF [25]. Mutations in BRAF have been documented
in several human malignancies, including thyroid, ovarian
cancer and melanoma where they appear to play an
important role [26]. For this reason in the recent past a
plethora of BRAF inhibitors have been developed and
tested in preclinical models. Among them, Vemurafenib,
a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of BRAFV600E (the most frequent mutated form of BRAF), which
has been approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the
treatment of metastatic melanoma, showed a significant
clinical response [7]. Unfortunately, clinical trials using
this drug on patients with metastatic CRC harboring the
BRAF-V600E mutation have given disappointing results
showing a very low percentage of clinical response
(about 5%) [9]. In recent studies, it has been proposed
that EGFR-mediated reactivation of the PI3K and MAPK
pathways leads to resistance to Vemurafenib in CRC cells
[14, 27]. In fact, high expression levels of EGFR are
observed in CRC, but not in melanoma cells, explaining
the different response of these two tumors. All these data
highlight the importance of the tumor microenvironment
and in particular of growth factors that may be secreted by
tumor-associated fibroblasts.
NRG-1β, the major ligand for ErbB-3, promotes
ErbB-2/ErbB-3 dimerization mainly leading to the
activation of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling
pathways [28]. Up-regulation of this signaling axis has
been documented in several types of cancer, including
breast, lung, pancreas and melanoma [2]. Moreover, in
melanoma, thyroid and CRC the use of RAF and ERK
inhibitors has been shown to result in removal of the
feedback inhibition exerted on ErbB-3 transcription. In
other words, inhibition of BRAF-V600E may relieve
a transcriptional inhibition and up-regulate receptor
expression, potentially allowing escape from Vemurafenibbased therapies [27, 29, 30]. Different clinical and animal
studies have shown that NRG-1β is secreted in the tumor
microenvironment and plays a crucial role in tumor
progression and therapy resistance and that overexpression
of this ligand is associated with worse clinical outcome
[31, 32].
We show that both ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 receptors
are expressed in colon CSCs and that NRG-1β plays
an important role in sustaining proliferation of both
wild-type and BRAF-V600E mutated cells. This data
extends previous reports that pointed to a role of ErbB3 in CRC progression [12]. Here we clearly provide
evidence that the NRG-1β/ErbB-3 axis can induce the
cancer stem cell compartment in tumors and induces their
clonogenic capacity even in BRAF-V600E mutant CSCs.
Interestingly, despite the fact that BRAF-V600E cells
are less dependent on growth factors as compared to the
wild-type counterpart, their growth can be significantly
stimulated by NRG-1β. This stimulation does not appear

We next investigated the role of ErbB-3 receptor in
NRG-1β-dependent resistance to Vemurafenib. To this end
we stably silenced ErbB-3 expression in the two BRAFV600E mutated cell lines. Loss of ErbB-3 expression
caused a marked impairment of ErbB-3, AKT and ERK
phosphorylation upon ligand stimulation (Figure 3A and
data not shown). Further, NRG-1β-dependent sphere
forming ability was impaired in receptor silenced cells as
compared to control (Figure 3B). Similarly, cells treated
with the ErbB-3 blocking antibody, EV20, showed a
marked reduction of ligand-induced clonogenicity and
activation of AKT and ERK (Figure 3C and D). Moreover,
we found that ErbB-3 knock-down or its blockage by
antibody treatment (EV20) abrogated the NRG-1β
dependent rescue from Vemurafenib (Figure 3E and F).
Consistently, NRG-1β dependent ErbB-3 activation is
increased in Vemurafenib treated cells and can be blocked
by EV20 (Supplementary Figure 2). Combined, these
observations indicate that the NRG-1β/ErbB-3 axis is
an effective mechanism of escape from Vemurafenib
treatment, in addition to the already reported activation
of EGFR.
Finally, to analyze whether blocking ErbB-3 has an
effect also on colon cancer growth in vivo, we generated
xenografts of Co123 and CC09. As shown in Figure 4
treatment with EV20 significantly delayed the outgrowth
of these cancers. Importantly, this effect was observed
when the antibody was administered immediately after
cell engraftment (Figure 4A), but also when tumors were
already established (Figure 4B), thus suggesting that antiErbB3 therapy may be useful both to limit CSC-induced
initiation and to prevent tumor growth of established
tumors.

DISCUSSION
In the past twenty years, development and approval
of targeted therapeutics, in particular monoclonal
antibodies Bevacizumab, Cetuximab and Panitumumab
(anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR, respectively), have
significantly prolonged median survival of patients with
metastatic CRC [15-21]. However, approximately 50%
of metastatic CRC present with KRAS mutations and as a
consequence anti-EGFR therapies are not effective [22].
In addition, half of the patients with wild-type KRAS,
which in principle should be responsive to these targeted
therapeutics, do not display benefit of the treatment.
Mounting evidences suggest that BRAF mutations,
occurring in 8-10% of CRC patients [23], may be in part
responsible for this lack of response [24]. Accordingly,
BRAF mutations observed in metastatic colorectal
cancer patients are associated with a dramatic increase in

to be due to an autocrine loop as we did not observe
production of the ErbB-3 ligand in these cell lines (data
not shown). Nevertheless, we found that exogenous NRG1β is able to stimulate colon CSCs and can even rescue
the anti-proliferative effects of Vemurafenib through the
activation of ErbB-3. In vivo, the source of NRG-1β is
likely to be the stromal compartment within tumors and in
agreement blocking the activation of ErbB-3 significantly
impacts the in vivo growth of colon cancers. The blockage
of growth is however not complete suggesting that other
growth factors, such as EGF can substitute for ErbB-3
activation.
Our data highlight a distinct escape mechanism by
which BRAF-V600E mutant colon cancers escape from
Vemurafenib blockade. Previous data indicated that EGFR
activation could support the outgrowth. Our current data
indicate that ErbB-3 activation provides a similarly potent
rescue mechanism. Our data therefore indicate that a
general ErbB-family inhibition is potentially required to
circumvent the escape mechanisms activated upon BRAF
inhibition.

Hybridization was performed to a Gene Chip HT HGU133+s PM Array Plate (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara,
California) according to manufacturer’s instruction.
The gene expression data were normalized and log2
transformed using robust multi-array average (RMA)
implemented in the affy package for R [39]. Whenever
genes were represented by multiple probesets, the probeset
with the highest mean expression was used in subsequent
analyses.

Limiting dilution assays (LD)
The frequency of stem cells was calculated using
the maximum-likelihood estimation method of limiting
dilution [40]. Cells were plated in serial dilution
(1,2,4,8,16,24,32,48 and 64 cells per well) in 96-wells
microplate with flat bottom and repellent surface for low
attachment (CELLSTAR Cell-Repellent Surface, Greiner
Bio-One, UK). After 3 weeks, the number of the clones
was counted and statistically evaluated using the Extreme
Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA) software. Graph
showed the means and standard deviation of the observed
percentage of the clonogenic population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Flow cytometry analysis (FACS)

Colon cancer stem cells culture and reagents

FACS analysis was performed according to the
standard procedures. The following antibodies were
used: mouse anti-human EGFR, clone H11 (DAKO),
anti-ErbB-2 Affibody® molecule, fluorescein conjugated
(Affibody, Solna, Sweden), mouse anti-human ErbB-3,
clone SGP1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-human
ErbB-4, clone H4.77.16 (Abcam), APC goat anti-mouse Ig
(BD Bioscience, Oxford, UK).

Colon cancer tissues were collected according to
the standard medical ethical procedures from Academic
Medical Center or University of Palermo. Patient-derived
colon cancer stem cells were generated and cultured as
previously described [33, 34]. Briefly, colon cancer stem
cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium/Ham’s F12 nutrient mixture (DMEM/F12)
supplemented with N2 supplement (Life Technologies,
Paisley, UK), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10 ng/
ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Peprotech, Rocky Hill,
NJ) at 37oC in 5% CO2 humidified incubator. All cultures
were passaged by enzymatic dissociation using trypsin
and trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St.
Louis, MO, USA). For stable ErbB-3 silencing, cells were
infected with pSuper retro–based vectors as described
[35]. Control vector pSuper 4Mut contains a four-point
mutated sequence unable to target the human ErbB-3
mRNA [36]. NRG-1β was purchased from R&D (R&D
Systems, Inc., MN, USA) or Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA, USA). Vemurafenib was purchased from
Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX 77054 USA). EV20
antibody was produced as described [37, 38].

Cell proliferation assays
Cells were seeded into 96-wells microplate (2500
cells/well) and cell proliferation over mentioned time
period was determined using Cell Titer Blue from
Promega (Madison, WI 53711 USA) according to the
manufacturer protocol. Briefly, 20 µl of reagent was added
into each 100 µl of medium and incubated for 4 hours in
37°C. The fluorescence was then measured in microplate
reader (Tecan) with excitation 535 nm and an emission of
590 nm. Fluorescence reading was normalized against the
empty well and proliferation was plotted as histograms or
curves with data points showing mean ±SD.

Microarray data collection and preprocessing

Immunochemistry

All RNA, treated with 1µM of Vemurafenib or
control (DMSO) for 48 hours, were collected using
NucleospinRNA kit (Bioke, Leiden, The Netherland).

Lysates from cells in culture were prepared by
washing cells twice in cold PBS followed by lysis with
either HNTG buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150mM

or RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation).
Immunoblotting was performed as described [41]. The
following antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology: phosphorylated ErbB-3 (Tyr1289),
phosphorylated AKT (Ser473), phosphorylated ERK1/2
(Thr202/Tyr204), AKT and ERK1/2. Anti ErbB-3 was

dose of 10 mg/kg, twice a week) was initiated 1 week after
cells engraftment when tumors were not yet established.
In an other set of experiments we used a second xenograft
model in which mice received the antibody treatment
once tumors had reached the approximate size of 100
mm3. Animals were divided in two arms in a manner to
provide a similar range of tumor size in each group. The
test groups received intraperitoneal injections of EV20
(10 mg/kg) twice a week, whereas the control groups
received PBS only. Tumor volumes were monitored twice
a week by a caliper and volumes were calculated using the
following formula: tumor volume = (length * width2)/2.
Results are expressed as Relative Tumor Volume, i.e.
[(measured volume time point x) / (volume at start of
treatment)]. p values were determined by Student’s t test
and considered significant for p < 0.05.

Animals
Athymic nude-Foxn1nu mice were obtained from
Harlan Laboratories (San Pietro Al Natisone, UD 33049,
Italy), aged 5-7 weeks and weighting approximately 20-25
g. Animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free
conditions with food and water provided ad libitum and
the animals’ health status was monitored daily. Procedures
involving animal and their care were established according
to the institutional guidelines in compliance with national
and international policies.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were done using R version 3.1.2
[42] and Bioconductor 3.0 [43]. The global effects of
vemurafenib treatment on gene expression were analyzed
using the limma package [44], modeling the cell line and
treatment effects. P values were adjusted for multiple
testing using Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction. Genes
were considered to be differentially expressed when p <
0.05. The resulting list of differentially expressed genes
was analyzed for functional enrichment using Gene
Ontology [45] and the Panther Classification System
[46]. P values were adjusted for multiple testing with the
Bonferroni correction.

qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using NucleospinRNA
kit (Bioke, Leiden, The Netherland) according to the
supplier’s instructions. RT was performed on 1 µg RNA
using Supercript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). After denaturation at 95oC for 2
min, PCR was performed for 40 cycles (1 min at 95°C,
45 s at 63°C, 45 s at 72°C) using SYBR Green (Roche).
Transcript levels were compared relative to b-Actin
