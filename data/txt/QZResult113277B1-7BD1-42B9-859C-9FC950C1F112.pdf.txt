Abstract
Photothermal ablation (PTA) is an emerging technique that uses near-infrared (NIR) laser light–generated heat
to destroy tumor cells. However, complete tumor eradication by PTA therapy alone is difﬁcult because
heterogeneous heat distribution can lead to sublethal thermal dose in some areas of the tumor. Successful
PTA therapy requires selective delivery of photothermal conducting nanoparticles to mediate effective PTA of
tumor cells, and the ability to combine PTA with other therapy modalities. Here, we synthesized multifunctional
doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded hollow gold nanospheres (DOX@HAuNS) that target EphB4, a member of the Eph
family of receptor tyrosine kinases overexpressed on the cell membrane of multiple tumors and angiogenic blood
vessels. Increased uptake of targeted nanoparticles T-DOX@HAuNS was observed in three EphB4-positive tumors
both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo release of DOX from DOX@HAuNS, triggered by NIR laser, was conﬁrmed by dualradiotracer technique. Treatment with T-DOX@HAuNS followed by NIR laser irradiation resulted in signiﬁcantly
decreased tumor growth when compared with treatments with nontargeted DOX@HAuNS plus laser or HAuNS
plus laser. The tumors in 6 of the 8 mice treated with T-DOX@HAuNS plus laser regressed completely with only
residual scar tissue by 22 days following injection, and none of the treatment groups experienced a loss in body
weight. Together, our ﬁndings show that concerted chemo-photothermal therapy with a single nanodevice
capable of mediating simultaneous PTA and local drug release may have promise as a new anticancer therapy.

Introduction
Photothermal ablation (PTA) therapy is a recently developed
technique that uses near-infrared (NIR) laser light–generated
heat to destroy tumor cells. PTA has gained popularity recently
because a speciﬁc amount of photoenergy is delivered directly
into the tumor mass without causing systemic effects, thus
promising minimally invasive intervention as an alternative to
surgery (1, 2). However, PTA therapy alone is unlikely to kill all
tumor cells because the heat distribution is nonuniform,
especially in areas peripheral to large blood vessels where heat
can be rapidly dissipated by circulating blood. To improve the
efﬁcacy and tumor selectivity of laser-induced PTA, light-

absorbing photothermal conducting nanoparticles are introduced. In principle, NIR laser–modulated photothermal effects
can not only enable PTA of tumor cells but also trigger release
of anticancer agents. Such a multimodal approach, which
permits simultaneous PTA therapy and chemotherapy, should
provide an opportunity for complete eradication of tumor cells.
Hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNS) are novel gold nanostructures ideally suited for PTA because of their unique combination of small size (30–50 nm), biocompatibility, and strong
and tunable absorption in the entire NIR region (3, 4). Owing to
their hollow interior, exceptionally high doxorubicin (DOX)
payload to HAuNS (up to 60% by weight, 4-fold of the payload
achievable with solid gold nanoparticles of the similar size)
could be achieved with HAuNS (5). To maximize the therapeutic efﬁcacy of DOX-loaded HAuNS (DOX@HAuNS), it is
essential that DOX@HAuNS are selectively delivered to the
tumor. The Eph receptors constitute the largest known family
of receptor tyrosine kinases and have been reported to control
various pathological processes, including tumor progression
and angiogenesis, chronic pain following tissue damage, inhibition of nerve regeneration after spinal cord injury, and
human congenital malformations (6–15). Overexpression of
EphB4 has also been observed in numerous tumor types,
including prostate, breast, bladder, lung, colon, gastric, and
ovarian cancers (6–8, 14–18). Knocking down EphB4 can result
in inhibition of tumor growth, induction of apoptosis, and

reduction in tumor vascularity (18). Therefore, EphB4 is a
particularly promising target for tumor-speciﬁc delivery of
DOX@HAuNS.
We have recently reported the ﬁrst micro-positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging agent for detection of EphB4 in
cancer cells (19). This PET imaging agent was developed on the
basis of a 14-mer peptide identiﬁed by phage display technology (15). The parent peptide TNYLFSPNGPIARAW (designated
as TNYL-RAW) and its derivatives displayed high binding
afﬁnity to EphB4, with an equilibrium dissociation constant
(Kd) values of 1.98 to 23 nmol/L (19). Cyclic peptide c(TNYLRAW) is a second-generation EphB4-binding antagonist with
improved plasma stability and high-receptor binding afﬁnity.
Here, we show for the ﬁrst time that using c(TNYL-RAW) as a
homing ligand, DOX@HAuNS were selectively targeted to
EphB4-positive tumors, and that concerted chemo-photothermal therapy mediated by EphB4-targeting DOX@HAuNS
induced remarkable antitumor efﬁcacy with reduced systemic
toxicity. Our results support the concept of integrating multiple functions into a single nanodevice to mediate simultaneous PTA and local drug release.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis of SH-PEG-c(TNYL-RAW)
The heterofunctional PEG linker SATA-PEG-CONHS containing a protected sulfohydryl group (S-acetylthioacetate,
SATA) and NHS activated ester on each end of the PEG chain
was ﬁrst synthesized. Brieﬂy, NH2-PEG-COOH (0.5 g, 0.25
mmol) and 1.2 equivalent N-succinimidyl-S-acetylthioacetate
(SATA) were dissolved in 2 mL anhydrous DCM, and then 3
equivalents of dry DIPEA was added dropwise. The reaction
solution was stirred at room temperature overnight. After all
organic solvent was removed under a vacuum, the crude
product was puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration with PD-10 column. The
collected aqueous solution was lyophilized to yield SATA-PEGCOOH, which was further activated with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide (EDC) and NHS to make SATAPEG-CONHS. c(TNYL-RAW) was synthesized on solid support
(Supplementary Information). The peptide was conjugated to
SATA-PEG5000-CONHS in a 1:1 molar ratio in DCM to obtain
SATA-PEG-c(TNYL-RAW). The product was puriﬁed by PD-10
column and then treated with 0.5 M NH2OH to obtain SH-PEGc(TNYL-RAW) before conjugation with HAuNS.
Synthesis of DOX-loaded, c(TNYL-RAW)–conjugated
HAuNS
HAuNS were synthesized according to a previously reported
method (5). Brieﬂy, cobalt nanoparticles were ﬁrst synthesized by deoxygenating deionized water containing 4.5 mL of
1 mol/L sodium borohydride, 2.8 mL of 0.1 mol/L sodium
citrate, and 1.0 mL of 0.4 mol/L cobalt chloride. After chloroauric acid was added into the solution containing cobalt
nanoparticles, the cobalt immediately reduced the gold ions
onto the surface of the nanoparticles and was simultaneously
oxidized to cobalt oxide. Any remaining cobalt was further
oxidized by air, resulting in the ﬁnal product, HAuNS. The size of
the HAuNS was determined using dynamic light scattering on a
Brookhaven 90Plus particle size analyzer. The UV-visible spec-

4778

tra were recorded on a Beckman Coulter DU-800 UV-visible
spectrometer. The morphology of the HAuNS was examined
using a JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL).
To obtain c(TNYL-RAW)-conjugated HAuNS, SH-PEG-c
(TNYL-RAW) (50 nmol) was mixed with 1.0 mL HAuNS solution [200 optical density (OD), 5.0 mg/mL] and stirred overnight. Then, SH-PEG (3 mmol) was added to the solution. After
another overnight stirring, c(TNYL-RAW)-conjugated HAuNS
was puriﬁed on a PD-10 column.
For DOX loading, free DOX (5 mg) in water (5 mL) was added
to c(TNYL-RAW)-HAuNS (40 OD) in 5 mL of 2.8 mmol/L citrate
solution, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for
24 hours. The resulting DOX-loaded c(TNYL-RAW)-HAuNS (TDOX@HAuNS) were puriﬁed by 3 repeated centrifugation and
washing steps.
Cell uptake of HAuNS
Cells were transferred and cultured onto 20-mm glass coverslips in a 24-well plate and allowed to grow for 2 days. The
medium was replaced with 1 mL of fresh culture medium
containing T-DOX@HAuNS. After incubation for 2 hours, cell
nuclei were stained with 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The
cell monolayer on the coverslip was removed, repeatedly
rinsed with PBS, and then mounted for microscopic examination. The cellular ﬂuorescence and dark-ﬁeld light scattering
images were examined under a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a dark-ﬁeld condenser.
Quantitative cellular uptake was determined using 111Inlabeled nanoparticles. Hey and A549 cells (1  106/dish)
were cultured in 60 15 mm2 dishes. Cells were incubated with 111In-labeled T-DOX@HAuNS or 111In-labeled DOX@
HAuNS (1.5 mCi/dish) for 3 hours at room temperature in
culture medium lacking FBS and phenol red. For the blocking experiments, cells were incubated with free c(TNYLRAW) (1.0 mmol/L) for 0.5 hours and then with 111In-labeled
T-DOX@HAuNS or 111In-labeled DOX@HAuNS under the
same conditions. Cells were rinsed 5 times with PBS (pH
7.4). After the PBS was removed, the cells were scraped off
the dish, suspended in PBS, and the radioactivity of the cell
suspension was then measured with a gamma counter.
Protein concentration in cell suspension was quantiﬁed
using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The data are expressed
as radioactivity (dpm/mg protein).
Cytotoxicity
Cytotoxicity was measured using an MTT assay according to
the manufacturer's suggested procedures. EphB4-positive
A2780 cells and EphB4-negative A549 cells were exposed to
free DOX, DOX@HAuNS, or T-DOX@-HAuNS for 72 hours. The
data are expressed as the percentage of surviving cells and are
reported as the mean values of 3 measurements.
Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution
All animal studies were carried out under Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee–approved protocols. For
the pharmacokinetic analysis, 8 healthy female Swiss mice
(22–25 g; Charles River Laboratories) for each group were
each injected intravenously with a dose of either 111In-labeled

Concerted Chemo-Photothermal Therapy Targeting EphB4

T-DOX@-HAuNS or 111In-labeled DOX@HAuNS [both 20 mCi,
1.0 mg/mL (40 OD) in 0.2 mL citrate–buffered solution]. At
predetermined intervals up to 48 hours, blood samples (10 mL)
were taken from the tail vein, and the radioactivity of each
sample was measured with a gamma counter. The percentage
of the injected dose per gram of blood (%ID/g) was calculated.
The blood pharmacokinetic parameters for the radiotracer
were analyzed using a noncompartmental model with WinNonlin 5.0.1 software (Pharsight).
To investigate the in vivo distribution of T-DOX@-HAuNS,
we intravenously injected female nude mice (Harlan) bearing 6 to 8 mm subcutaneous A2780, MDA-MB-231, or Hey
tumors with 111In-labeled T-DOX@-HAuNS or 111In-labeled
DOX@HAuNS (20 mCi/mouse in 0.2 mL). For the blocking
studies, the mice were intravenously injected with a mixture
of 111In-labeled T-DOX@-HAuNS (20 mCi/mouse in 0.2 mL)
and an excess of free c(TNYL-RAW) (0.3 mmol). Mice were
killed at 24 hours after injection. Various tissues, including
tumors, were collected and weighted. The radioactivity for
each sample was measured with a gamma counter. Uptake of
nanoparticles in various tissues was calculated as %ID/g.
Single-photon emission computed tomography imaging
Mice bearing subcutaneous Hey tumors were intravenously
injected with 111In-labeled T-DOX@HAuNS or DOX@HAuNS
[8.0 mCi/kg, 0.525 mg/mL (25 OD)]. For the blocking studies,
mice were injected intravenously with a mixture of 111Inlabeled DOX@c(TNYL-RAW)-HAuNS and free c(TNYL-RAW)
(0.3 mmol). The mice were placed in a prone position and
anesthetized with 0.5% to 2.0% isoﬂurane gas (Iso-Thesia) in
oxygen. Single-photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) images were generated at 24 hours after injection.
After imaging, the mice were killed and their tumors were
removed. The tumors were snap-frozen and cut into 5-mm
slices that were then used for autoradiography analysis on a
Fujiﬁlm FLA-5100 imaging system.
NIR laser–triggered DOX release in vivo
For measuring the photothermal effect of T-DOX@HAuNS,
mice bearing Hey tumors were injected intravenously with
saline (5.0 mL/kg) or T-DOX@-HAuNS (5.0 mL/kg of 50 OD
HAuNS). At 24 hours after injection, the tumor was irradiated
with an NIR laser (3W/cm2) for 5 minutes (Diomed 15 Plus)
through the skin surface. Temperature was measured with 2
thermocouples inserted into the tumor. Care was taken to
ensure that the thermocouple was not directly exposed to the
laser beam.
The DOX release mediated by the photothermal effect in the
Hey tumors was studied using 111In- and 3H-labeled T-DOX@HAuNS, in which the HAuNS were labeled with 111In and
the DOX with 3H. Tumors were irradiated by NIR laser light
(3 W/cm2 for 5 minutes) at 1 hour after intratumoral injection
of the dual-labeled nanoparticles (3H: 10 mCi; 111In: 20 mCi) into
the center of the tumor. The mice were killed 5 minutes after
laser irradiation, and the tumors were removed, snap-frozen,
and sliced into 10-mm sections. Injected tumors that did not
receive NIR laser treatment were similarly prepared and used
as controls.

www.aacrjournals.org

The radioactive signals from 111In and 3H were detected
using a Fujiﬁlm FLA-5100 imaging system. Brieﬂy, the sections
of the tumors were exposed to phosphorous screen ﬁlm (an SR
imaging plate) for 15 minutes at 10 C, and the 111In autoradiograph was obtained by scanning the ﬁlm. After the 111In
was completely decayed (stored at 80 C for 5 weeks), the
same sections were exposed to phosphorous screen ﬁlm (a TR
imaging plate) for 3 days at 10 C, and the 3H autoradiograph
was obtained by scanning the ﬁlm. Concurrently, control
specimens from tumors that were not laser treated were
subjected to the same procedures. The autoradiographic distribution of 111In-HAuNS and 3H-DOX was compared by overlaying the 2 autoradiograms.
Antitumor activity in vivo
Hey tumors were generated by subcutaneous injection of
Hey cells (5.0  106 cells/mouse). When the mean tumor
volume reached approximately 200 mm3, mice were divided
into 4 groups consisting of 6 to 8 mice each. Mice in groups 1
through 4 were injected intravenously with saline (n ¼ 6, 5.0
mL/kg), HAuNS (n ¼ 6, 5.0 mL/kg of 1.25 mg HAuNS/mL
solution), DOX@HAuNS (n ¼ 7, 10 mg equivalent DOX/kg, 5.0
mL/kg of 1.25 mg HAuNS/mL solution), and T-DOX@HAuNS
(n ¼ 8, 10 mg equivalent DOX/kg, 5.0 mL/kg of 1.25 mg HAuNS/
mL solution), respectively. All mice received NIR laser irradiation through the skin surface at 24 hours postinjection
(2.0 W/cm2 for 3 minutes). The tumor dimensions were
measured with a caliper, and the tumor volume was calculated
according to the following equation: volume ¼ (tumor length)
 (tumor width)2/2. At the end of the experiment (when the
tumor size reached >1500 mm3 or 22 days after initial injection,
whichever came ﬁrst), mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation,
and the tumors were collected and weighed. Parts of the
tumors were ﬁxed in formalin and cut into 5-mm slices for
hematoxylin and eosin staining. Body weight was measured
weekly to assess systemic toxicity.
Statistics
Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed using noncompartmental WinNonlin method. Statistical analysis was conducted using the SYSTAT program. P values were obtained
using the 2-sample t test. For cellular uptake, biodistribution, and antitumor activity data, statistic analyses were
conducted by ANOVA, with P < 0.05 considered to be
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Synthesis and characterization of EphB4-targeted
T-DOX@HAuNS
Before carrying out efﬁcacy studies, we conducted a number
of experiments to fully characterize the targeted DOX@HAuNS
system for in vivo delivery. The average diameter of the HAuNS
was 36.8  1.6 nm, as determined by dynamic light scattering.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) conﬁrmed that the
HAuNS consisted of a thin gold shell (4 nm thickness) with a
hollow interior. The extinction spectrum showed that the
plasma resonance peak for HAuNS was approximately 800 nm
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

In vitro uptake in cancer cells
Next, we evaluated the selectivity of uptake of c(TNYLRAW)-conjugated DOX@HAuNS in EphB4-positive tumor
cells. Western blotting indicated high expression levels of
EphB4 receptor in MBA-MD-231, A2780, and Hey cells, but
only low expression level in A549 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3A). Immunostaining using anti-EphB4 antibody conﬁrmed
strong EphB4 signals from A2780, MDA-MB-231, and Hey cells
but weak signal from A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). On
the basis of these ﬁndings, we selected the Hey tumor for
subsequent efﬁcacy studies.
Figure 2A shows representative photomicrographs of ﬂuorescence and dark-ﬁeld images of Hey cells incubated with TDOX@HAuNS. The nanoparticles were readily taken up by
the tumor cells. The ﬂuorescence signal from the DOX
was colocalized with the signal from the HAuNS, indicating
that the DOX remained associated with the HAuNS after
T-DOX@HAuNS were internalized. Under the same conditions,
signiﬁcantly more T-DOX@HAuNS was internalized in the cells
with high EphB4 receptor expression (Hey) than in the cells
with low EphB4 receptor expression (A549; P<0.05, Fig. 2B). The
addition of free c(TNYL-RAW) peptide into the culture medium (Hey cells) induced a signiﬁcant decrease in the cellular
uptake of the nanoparticles (P < 0.005) but did not cause a
change in uptake in the A549 cells that had low EphB4 receptor

The targeting ligand cyclic peptide c(TNYL-RAW) is a second-generation EphB4–binding antagonist. The peptide had
Kd of 4.4 nmol/L as determined by surface plasmon resonance
sensorgram (Supplementary Fig. S2A). No degradation of 64Culabeled c(TNYL-RAW) was observed by high-performance
liquid chromatography after incubation of the peptide in
mouse plasma over a period of 24 hours, whereas 64Cu-labeled
linear TNYL-RAW was degraded as soon as 2 hours after
incubation (Supplementary Fig. S2B). c(TNYL-RAW) was
linked to SATA-PEG-NHS through an activated ester. After

(Fig. 1). The amount of c(TNYL-RAW) conjugated to the

Concerted Chemo-Photothermal Therapy Targeting EphB4

(242.8%ID h/mL  46%ID h/mL, P ¼ 0.046). However, there
was no signiﬁcant difference between the 2 HAuNS formulations in any other pharmacokinetic parameters (P  0.05),
suggesting that the conjugation of c(TNYL-RAW) to
HAuNS did not signiﬁcantly change the pharmacokinetic
properties of the nanoparticles. Both types of nanoparticles
(T-DOX@HAuNS and DOX@HAuNS) were almost completely
eliminated from the blood at 48 hours after injection. Figure 3B
shows the biodistribution of T-DOX@HAuNS, T-DOX@HAuNS
with blocking by free c(TNYL-RAW), and DOX@HAuNS in
nude mice at 24 hours after injection. Most nanoparticles
were taken up by the liver, spleen, and kidney. Interestingly,
signiﬁcantly less T-DOX@HAuNS than DOX@HAuNS accumulated in the liver (P ¼ 0.0009) and the spleen (P ¼ 0.0006).
Conversely, T-DOX@HAuNS had signiﬁcantly higher uptake in
the kidney than DOX@HAuNS did (P ¼ 0.004). With the
exception of kidney uptake, coinjection with an excess of c
(TNYL-RAW) did not affect the biodistribution pattern of TDOX@HAuNS. c(TNYL-RAW) blocking reduced the kidney
uptake of T-DOX@HAuNS from 17.2%ID/g to 12.9%ID/g
(P ¼ 0.02). This ﬁnding may be reﬂective of EphB4 expression
in venous endothelium of the kidney (20).
To show efﬁciency of tumor targeting, we next carried
out biodistribution studies in tumor-bearing mice.
T-DOX@HAuNS displayed signiﬁcantly higher accumulation
than nontargeted DOX@HAuNS in tumors with high EphB4
receptor expression, with 3.0-, 2.1-, and 1.6-fold mean increases
in Hey (P ¼ 0.0016), A2780 (P ¼ 0.0005), and MDA-MB-231

expression (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that T-DOX@HAuNS
was taken up by EphB4-positive cells via receptor-mediated
endocytosis.
Cytotoxicity
For cells with low EphB4 expression (A549), the difference in cytotoxicity between T-DOX@HAuNS and nontargeted DOX@HAuNS was minimal, demonstrating the
importance of EphB4-mediated uptake (Supplementary Fig.
S4A). Free DOX exhibited higher toxicity in A549 cells than
both T-DOX@HAuNS and DOX@HAuNS. The lower cytotoxic potency of T-DOX@HAuNS and DOX@HAuNS can be
attributed to relatively stable complexes formed between
DOX and HAuNS and delayed DOX release inside cells.
However, signiﬁcantly higher toxicity was shown for
T-DOX@HAuNS in A2780 cells than either free DOX or
DOX@HAuNS (Supplementary Fig. S4B). The higher cellular
cytotoxicity with targeted nanoparticles can be attributed
to the increased uptake of T-DOX@HAuNS in the target
cells.
Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and SPECT imaging
Figure 3A shows the mean blood activity time proﬁle
of 111In-labeled T-DOX@HAuNS and DOX@HAuNS. The
pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1.
DOX@HAuNS had moderately higher area under the blood
drug concentration–time curve extrapolated to inﬁnite time
(AUC0-¥, 322.3%ID h/mL  72%ID h/mL) than T-DOX@HAuNS

tumors (P ¼ 0.019), respectively (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the
addition of free c(TNYL-RAW) peptide signiﬁcantly reduced
the uptake of T-DOX@HAuNS in these tumors, with 2.3-, 1.5-,
and 2.0-fold decreases, respectively (Fig. 3C). These results
indicated that T-DOX@HAuNS was actively targeted to tumors
expressing EphB4.
SPECT images showed signiﬁcant blood activity in the liver
and spleen for both 111In-labeled T-DOX@HAuNS and
DOX@HAuNS (Fig. 4). By 24 hours after injection, accumulation of T-DOX@HAuNS in the tumor was clearly visualized (Fig.
4A). The uptake of T-DOX@HAuNS in the Hey tumors was
blocked by an excess of free c(TNYL-RAW) (Fig. 4B). Similarly,
tumor uptake of then nontargeted DOX@HAuNS was barely
visible (Fig. 4C). Autoradiographs of all 3 tumors (Hey, A2780,
and MDA-MB-231) showed stronger 111In radioactivity signals
with T-DOX@HAuNS than with T-DOX@HAuNS plus free c
(TNYL-RAW) or with DOX@HAuNS (Fig. 4D).
In vivo antitumor activity
The temperature measured by the thermocouple within
the tumor reached approximately 53 C after 5 minutes of
NIR laser exposure on the tumor surface at an output power
of 3 W/cm2 in mice injected with T-DOX@HAuNS (Fig. 5A).
No change in temperature was noted under the same conditions in the tumors of control mice. Dual-tracer autoradiography showed that immediately after NIR laser irradiation, 3H-DOX was released and dispersed into the area
surrounding the site where T-DOX@HAuNS was introduced.
Conversely, 3H-DOX was mostly colocalized with 111InHAuNS in mice that did not undergo NIR laser treatment
(Fig. 5B).
Figure 6A shows the Hey tumor growth curves after
intravenous injections of saline, HAuNS [5.0 mL/kg of 1.25
mg HAuNS/mL saline (50 OD), no DOX, no targeting],
DOX@HAuNS (10 mg equivalent DOX/kg, 5.0 mL/kg of
1.25 mg HAuNS/mL), and T-DOX@HAuNS (10 mg equivalent
DOX/kg, 5.0 mL/kg of 1.25 mg HAuNS/mL). Mice in each
group received NIR laser treatment (2.0 W/cm2 for 3 minutes) 24 hours after injection. The mice in the saline plus

signiﬁcantly enhanced antitumor activity compared with
saline plus laser, HAuNS plus laser, and DOX@HAuNS plus
laser. The mean tumor weight in T-DOX@HAuNS plus laser
group on day 22 after treatment was 0.0038  0.0007 g (n ¼
8), which was signiﬁcantly smaller than that of the saline
plus laser (1.2  0.51 g on day 9, n ¼ 6; P<0.0001), HAuNS
plus laser (1.5  0.34 g on day 22, n ¼ 6; P<0.0001), and
DOX@HAuNS plus laser (0.36  0.24 g on day 22, n ¼ 7;
P<0.001) groups (Fig. 6B). The tumors in this group of mice
became whitish immediately after treatment, suggesting
disruption of blood perfusion. Remarkably, the tumors in
6 of the 8 mice treated with T-DOX@HAuNS plus laser
regressed completely and became scar tissue by 22 days
after the injection. Histologic analysis showed the presence
of scar tissue and a lack of residual tumor cells in mice
treated with T-DOX@HAuNS plus laser (Fig. 6C). Tumors in
the nontargeted DOX@HAuNS plus laser group became
loose and discrete, suggesting damage to tumor cells. However, tumors could not be completely eradicated without
targeting ligand. Tumors in the saline plus laser group
appeared to be intact. In the saline plus laser and
DOX@HAuNS plus laser treatment groups, viable tumor
cells were found throughout the tumor volumes (Fig. 6C).
No apparent signs of toxicity were observed throughout the

www.aacrjournals.org

In this study, we showed that T-DOX@HAuNS had signiﬁcantly greater cytotoxic effects in tumor cells with high EphB4
receptor expression than DOX@HAuNS and free DOX did in
vitro. Moreover, T-DOX@HAuNS showed enhanced antitumor
activity when combined with NIR laser irradiation than
DOX@HAuNS plus laser treatment in vivo. These ﬁndings
indicate that c(TNYL-RAW) peptide is highly effective for
selective delivery of T-DOX@HAuNS to tumors with high
expression of EphB4. The signiﬁcantly enhanced antitumor
activity of T-DOX@HAuNS could be attributed to (i) increased
accumulation of the nanoparticles in tumors, (ii) controlled
release of DOX mediated by NIR laser irradiation, and (iii)
synergistic interaction between chemotherapy and PTA therapy, both of which were activated concurrently by NIR laser.
In our nanoconstruct, c(TNYL-RAW) peptide with high
EphB4 binding afﬁnity and high plasma stability was conjugated to HAuNS through a PEG linker, which ensured availability of the peptide to the target receptor (Fig. 1). This
strategy has been successfully used for the formulation of
other targeted nanoparticles by us and others (4, 21–24).
Additional monofunctional SH-PEG chains were introduced
together with SH-PEG-c(TNYL-RAW) to ensure that all available gold surface was covered by PEG. This process was used to
create DOX@HAuNS and ligand-conjugated T-DOX@HAuNS,
both of which had high colloidal stability.
Both in vitro and in vivo data showed that tumor uptake of TDOX@HAuNS could be partially blocked by free c(TNYL-RAW)
peptide, conﬁrming that cell uptake of T-DOX@HAuNS was
mediated by EphB4 (Figs. 2–4). In vivo, T-DOX@HAuNS displayed signiﬁcantly higher accumulation than nontargeted
DOX@HAuNS in all 3 tumor models evaluated. Because
DOX@HAuNS and T-DOX@HAuNS exhibited similar pharmacokinetic behaviors (Fig. 3A, Table 1), the difference in tumor
uptake between targeted and nontargeted HAuNS is unlikely a
result of enhanced permeability and retention effect. Hence,
our data support successful EphB4 receptor–mediated targeted delivery of T-DOX@HAuNS after intravenous injection.
In addition to active targeting mediated by receptor ligands
exempliﬁed in this study, physiologic and physical methods
such as tumor priming, vascular disruption, degradation of the
extracellular matrix, and vessel normalization may be used to
improve tumor distribution of nanoparticles (25–29). Recent
studies have shown that losartan, a clinically approved angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is an effective agent for normalizing tumor vasculature (29). Losartan inhibited collagen I
production by tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts, which led to a
dose-dependent reduction in stromal collagen in several
human tumor xenograft models. As a result, the drug enhanced
the delivery and efﬁcacy of intravenously injected pegylated
liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil). These studies suggest that
targeted nanoparticles such as T-DOX@HAuNS may achieve
further improvement in tumor deposition when combined
with physiological and physical approaches.

The temperature in tumors of mice received intravenous
injection of T-DOX@HAuNS reached approximately 53 C after
5 minutes of continuous wave NIR laser exposure at 3 W/cm2
(Fig. 5A). This temperature is sufﬁcient for causing irreversible
damage to cancer cells (30). As expected, there was no temperature change in the tumors of mice that did not receive the
nanoparticle injection followed by NIR irradiation. Therefore,
T-DOX@HAuNS medicated efﬁcient photothermal effect. We
have previously shown that in aqueous solution, the release of
DOX from DOX@HAuNS could be activated by NIR laser
irradiation (5). To show that DOX could be released in vivo
upon NIR irradiation, we used an autoradiographic technique
with dual-radiotracer labeling. 3H undergoes beta decay with a
12.3-year half-life, releasing 18.6 keV of energy in the process.
On the other hand, 111In emits gamma radiation with a half-life

advantage of these differences in the decay properties between
3
H and 111In, we were able to separate signals from HAuNS and
DOX in the tumors. Thus, immediately after NIR laser irradiation at 3 W/cm2, 3H-DOX was dissociated from 111In-HAuNS,
whereas in the control tumor not exposed to NIR laser irradiation, signals from 3H-DOX colocalized perfectly with 111InHAuNS (Fig. 6B). These data conﬁrm that free DOX was
released from T-DOX@HAuNS and then diffused away from
the nanoparticles when tumors were exposed to the NIR laser.
The antitumor efﬁcacy of free DOX, DOX@HAuNS,
DOX@HAuNS plus NIR laser was investigated against MDAMB-231 tumors in our previous work (31). There was no
signiﬁcant difference in tumor size between groups treated

equivalent DOX/kg per injection, 2 injections). However,
DOX@HAuNS plus NIR laser (15 mg equivalent DOX/kg per
injection, 2 injections) reduced tumor volume signiﬁcantly
more than the other 2 treatments (31). In these studies, free
DOX at a single dose of 15 mg/kg caused serious systemic
toxicity and cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we did not use free DOX
as a control in the current study. Instead, we used nontargeted
DOX@HAuNS as a control and compared the antitumor studies of T-DOX@HAuNS against ovarian Hey tumors with that of
DOX@HAuNS. Combined T-DOX@HAuNS plus laser treatments showed signiﬁcantly better antitumor activity than
combined HAuNS plus laser (PTA only) and nontargeted
DOX@HAuNS plus laser treatments (Fig. 6).
Signiﬁcantly, this higher antitumor activity was achieved
without causing signiﬁcant systemic toxicity, as indicated by
continued increase in body weight in mice in all treatment
groups (Supplementary Fig. S5). In our previous work, we
compared the toxicity of free DOX, liposomal DOX, and
DOX@HAuNS (31). DOX@HAuNS after a single dose at 60 mg
equivalent DOX/kg had no cardiotoxicity compared with
liposomal DOX (2 doses at a total dose of 30 mg DOX/kg)
and free DOX (single dose of 15 mg/kg). In the heart, 100% of
both liposomal DOX- and free DOX–treated mice had a
vacuolar cardiomyopathy. However, for mice treated with
DOX@HAuNS, the histopathologic features in the heart were
similar to those observed in the saline-treated control mice and
no abnormal features were observed. Because DOX@HAuNS
and T-DOX@HAuNS had similar pharmacokinetic properties
and there was no signiﬁcant different in heart accumulation
between the 2 agents, we expect that T-DOX@HAuNS
will display toxicity proﬁle similar to that of DOX@HAuNS.
Further studies are required to document both short- and longterm systemic toxicity of T-DOX@HAuNS after intravenous
injection.
Our study has several limitations. First, in vivo release of
DOX upon laser irradiation was conducted after intratumoral
injection, which may not accurately reﬂect DOX distribution
that will be seen after systemic administration, followed by NIR
treatment. However, the sole purpose of this experiment was to
examine whether DOX release can be triggered by NIR laser
irradiation under in vivo conditions, which was conﬁrmed in
the current study. Second, we did not analyze the distribution
of DOX when DOX@HAuNS and T-DOX@HAuNS were
given intravenously. Detailed DOX biodistribution in comparison to HAuNS after systemic administration of nontargeted
DOX@HAuNS has been studied and published in our previous
work using a dual-radiotracer technique (31). It was found that
DOX@HAuNS was stable in the blood during the ﬁrst 6 hours
after injection. By 24 hours after injection, there was disparity
in biodistribution pattern between DOX and HAuNS, indicating gradual release of DOX from DOX@HAuNS.

A potential limitation of the proposed concurrent chemophotothermal therapy strategy is penetration depth of NIR
light. The current state-of-the-art enables NIR light to penetrate up to 1 to 2 cm in soft tissue (32). With the newer 10- to 40mm long quartz laser ﬁbers and water-cooled laser application
sheaths, ablative areas of 50 to 80 mm have been achieved (33–
35). Deeper reach is also possible with various minimally
invasive interventional techniques, such as endoscopic, intravascular, and percutaneous approaches. Currently, laser beam
is delivered through laser ﬁbers inserted into the tumors, as in
the case of primary and metastatic liver cancer (33, 35, 36) and
lung metastases (37). In our previous work, we evaluated the
triggered release of paciltaxel via NIR laser irradiation and its
antitumor efﬁcacy by hepatic arterial administration of
HAuNS- and paclitaxel-loaded microspheres into rabbits with
liver carcinoma in situ (38). The results showed that NIR laser
irradiation after the microspheres administration results in
intratumoral heating. NIR laser irradiation can trigger release
of paclitaxel from the microspheres, and can potentially
increase the efﬁcacy of treatment after hepatic arterial delivery
of the microspheres in liver tumors. Thus, we believe that
chemo-photothermal therapy approach entailed in this work is
best suited for unresectable, locally advanced disease that
ultimately causes patient death. It is envisioned that chemoPTA therapy may also be used in conjunction with surgery,
especially used in postsurgery setting to eradicate residual
tumor cells. In such as case, the laser beam can be conveniently
delivered through surface exposure.
