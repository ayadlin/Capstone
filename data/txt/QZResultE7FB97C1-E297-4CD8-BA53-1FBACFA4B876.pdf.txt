Abstract
The majority of melanomas show constitutive activation of the RAS-RAF-MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)-mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. AZD6244 is a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor that markedly reduces
tumor P-MAPK levels, but it produces few clinical responses in melanoma patients. An improved understanding of the determinants of resistance to AZD6244 may lead to improved patient selection and effective
combinatorial approaches. The effects of AZD6244 on cell growth and survival were tested in a total of 14
Braf-mutant and 3 wild-type human cutaneous melanoma cell lines. Quantitative assessment of phosphoprotein levels in the Braf-mutant cell lines by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis showed no significant
association between P-MEK or P-MAPK levels and AZD6244 sensitivity, but activation-specific markers in
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway correlated with resistance. We also identified resistant cell
lines without basal activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. RPPA characterization of the time-dependent changes
in signaling pathways revealed that AZD6244 produced durable and potent inhibition of P-MAPK in sensitive
and resistant Braf-mutant cell lines, but several resistant lines showed AZD6244-induced activation of AKT.
In contrast, sensitive cell lines showed AZD6244 treatment–induced upregulation of PTEN protein and mRNA
expression. Inhibition of AKT, TORC1/2, or insulin-like growth factor I receptor blocked AZD6244-induced
activation of AKT and resulted in synergistic cell killing with AZD6244. These findings identify basal and
treatment-induced regulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway as a critical regulator of AZD6244 sensitivity in
Braf-mutant cutaneous melanoma cells and the novel regulation of PTEN expression by AZD6244 in sensitive
cells, and suggest new combinatorial approaches for patients. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8736–47. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer.
Patients with metastatic disease have a median survival of
<1 year, and outcomes are not improved with chemotherapy
or immunotherapy (1). A review of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database from 1950 to 2000 showed
that the incidence of and mortality from melanoma are increasing at a greater rate than for any other cancer. Thus,
there is a tremendous need for more effective therapeutic
approaches for this disease. The majority of melanomas
harbor an activating mutation in the RAS-RAF-mitogen-

activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Braf
mutations are detected in approximately 50% of melanomas
(2). Over 90% of these mutations affect the V600 residue,
and they result in constitutive activation of the BRAF protein
(3). In addition, approximately 20% of melanomas have an
activating Nras mutation (2). Mutations in Nras also activate
the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway (4). As Braf and Nras mutations
are mutually exclusive (5, 6), approximately 70% of melanomas harbor a mutation in the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway.
Many melanomas without identifiable mutations in the
pathway also show constitutive MAPK activation (7). Thus,
activation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway is likely a critical event in melanoma, and it may be an important therapeutic target.
AZD6244 (ARRY-142996, Selumetinib) is a potent, highly
selective, uncompetitive inhibitor of MAP/ERK kinase 1/2
(MEK1/2; ref. 8). AZD6244 has an in vitro IC50 of 14 nmol/L
against purified MEK, whereas minimal inhibition was seen
in >40 kinases at 10 μmol/L. AZD6244 inhibited extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation (P-ERK) at
∼40 nmol/L in cells growing in vitro and in xenografts growing in mice. Initial testing showed that many different cancer
types, including melanoma, colon, breast, and pancreatic
cancer with Braf or Nras mutations, were sensitive to the

inhibitory effects of AZD6244, although the degree of growth
suppression varied even among cell lines with those mutations (9). Phase I clinical testing in patients showed that
AZD6244 was well tolerated (10). Paired biopsies from 20
patients with assessable tissue showed a mean reduction
in tumor P-ERK of 79% with AZD6244 treatment. A subsequent randomized phase II trial in metastatic melanoma
compared AZD6244 with temozolomide, a standard cytotoxic agent used in melanoma (11). Even among the patients
with Braf mutations (n = 67), which in vitro generally correlated with sensitivity to AZD6244, surprisingly there was
only a 12% clinical response rate, which was not superior
to temozolomide.
The clinical experience with AZD6244 shows that doses
can be achieved in patients that significantly inhibit the
RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway. There is also evidence that clinical
responses can be achieved in some patients. However, the
rate of clinical response, particularly among Braf-mutant
patients, is lower than predicted by preclinical testing and
less than that reported with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4032/
RG7204. (12). The future clinical use of AZD6244 would be
enhanced by an improved understanding of the factors that
predict and regulate sensitivity to the drug. Previous testing
of other MEK inhibitors in melanoma cell lines showed that
P-ERK levels, both at baseline and with treatment, did not
correlate with the degree of cell growth inhibition that was
achieved (13). Studies are currently ongoing to further investigate a possible threshold level of in vivo pathway inhibition
that correlates with clinical responses to RAS-RAF-MAPK
pathway inhibitors, particularly PLX4032. However, studies
with other targeted therapies have shown that inhibition of
the intended target often results in unexpected activation of
other pathways through feedback regulation of signaling
networks (14, 15). Understanding these changes can identify
combinatorial approaches that overcome these effects and
improve efficacy. We have developed reverse phase protein
arrays (RPPA) to perform efficient and quantitative assessment of signaling pathways in cancer (16). We have used
RPPA to perform integrated analysis of kinase signaling pathways with clinical and molecular features in a number of
cancers, including melanoma (17–19). We have also used
RPPA to identify time- and dose-dependent changes in kinase signaling networks in cancer cells in response to growth
factors and targeted therapies (20, 21).
To improve our understanding of the regulators of treatment response in melanoma, we analyzed a panel of Brafmutant human cutaneous melanoma cell lines for their sensitivity to growth and survival inhibition by AZD6244. We
compared these effects with the baseline activation status
of signaling pathways in the cells, and with AZD6244 treatment–induced changes in signaling networks. These studies
have identified the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT
pathway as a critical regulator of the efficacy of AZD6244
in Braf-mutant melanomas, including in cells without baseline activation of the pathway. We also identified and validated combinatorial approaches that increase the cytocidal
effects of AZD6244 in Braf-mutant melanoma cell lines,
which suggest strategies for testing in patients.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and inhibitors
All human melanoma cell lines were authenticated by
short tandem repeat fingerprinting, as previously described
(17). The mutation status of Braf, Nras, c-Kit, PIK3CA, and
Akt1/2/3 was determined by mass spectroscopy–based genotyping, and has been reported previously (17, 22, 23). Cells
were maintained in RPMI media in 5% fetal bovine serum
(Gemini Bioproducts) at 37°C supplemented with 5% CO2.
AZD6244 and AZD8055 were obtained under a material
transfer agreement with Astra Zeneca. Rapamycin was from
Cell Signaling Technology. Recombinant insulin-like growth
factor I (IGF-I) was from Invitrogen.
Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates overnight and treated
with increasing concentrations of drugs or DMSO (vehicle).
The DMSO concentrations were maintained at 0.02% in all
wells. After 48-hour incubation, cell viability was determined
using Cell Titer Blue Cell Viability Assay (Promega). Data
were analyzed and graphed using MS-Excel.
Cell cycle analysis
Cells seeded in 6-well plates were treated with inhibitors
and/or siRNA as described. After the indicated treatment
periods, cells were trypsinized, fixed in 70% ethanol, and
stained with propidium iodide (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle
analysis was performed using a BCI XL4 flow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter Inc.), the data were analyzed using MultiCycle AV software (Phoenix Flow Systems), and graphs were
generated using MS-Excel.
Apoptosis assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates overnight and treatments were performed as described. Apoptosis was determined by the cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragment
method using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus Kit (Roche
Applied Science).
RPPA and Western blotting analysis
Cells were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture plates overnight,
treated with AZD6244 or vehicle (DMSO) in triplicate, and harvested at the indicated time points. Protein lysate preparation
for RPPA analysis has been described previously (16–20). RPPA
analysis was performed by the University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Functional Proteomics Core Facility. Samples
were analyzed for the expression of 94 protein markers using
RPPA-validated antibodies (Supplementary Table S1). Results
were normalized as previously described (17), and were reported as log2 values. After correcting for sample loading
differences, for each cell line and time point the protein
expression levels were normalized against those of DMSOtreated cells. Clustering analysis was performed using Cluster
2.1 and was visualized using Treeview software (http://rana.
lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.html). Western blotting analysis was
performed using lysates prepared through the same methods,
using standard Western blotting procedures (16). Antibodies

added after 48 hours, and cells were harvested after 24 hours
or 48 hours for Western blotting and cell cycle analysis, respectively. The siRNAs used were siControl RISC-free, siPTEN,
siAKT (mix of AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 siRNAs), siIGFIR, (Dharmacon), and siIGFI (Ambion).
RNA analysis
Cells seeded in 10-cm plates were treated with AZD6244 or
vehicle (DMSO). After 24-hour incubation, RNA was isolated
using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA was quantified using
Nanodrop. Reverse transcription and PCR amplification
were performed using the Taqman One-Step RT-PCR assay
reagent using PTEN or GAPDH primer-probe mixes from
Applied Biosystems Inc. Fold changes in the treated samples
compared with controls were determined using the formula:
fold change = efficiencyδCt, where δCt is the threshold cycle
difference between control and treated samples normalized
against GAPDH expression.
Measurement of secreted IGF-I
Cells (105) were seeded in 6-well plates overnight, replenished with 0.5 mL fresh media, and treated with AZD6244 for
24 hours. siRNA-treated cells were replenished with 0.5 mL of
fresh media 48 hours after transfection and then were treated
with AZD6244 for 24 hours. Secreted IGF-I in the media was
quantified using the Quantikine human IGF-1 Immunoassay
kit (R&D Systems).

Results
Comparison of baseline signaling pathways with
growth inhibitory effects of AZD6244
We initially determined the relative sensitivity of 11 Brafmutant cutaneous melanoma cell lines to growth inhibition
by AZD6244 (Fig. 1A). This panel included four cell lines
(WM2664, WM1799, UCSD-354L, WM1552) with concurrent
PTEN loss and one cell line with concurrent Akt3 E17K
mutation (WM46). We also tested two cell lines that were
wild type for Braf and Nras (Mewo, HS294T). Overall, the cell
lines were organized in three groups, which we called group 1
(high sensitivity), group 2 (intermediate sensitivity), and
group 3 (low sensitivity). Of the wild-type cell lines, HS294T
was not sensitive to AZD6244 (group 3), but Mewo was
(group 1). To further investigate the observed heterogeneity
in sensitivity to AZD6244, cell cycle analysis was performed
on cell lines from each group. The group 1 cell lines WM35
(Fig. 1B), A375, and UACC257 (Supplementary Fig. S1) showed
a G1 cell cycle arrest with 40 nmol/L AZD6244, and a marked
sub-G1 accumulation with higher doses (i.e. >60% sub-G1 with
360 nmol/L). AZD6244 treatment of the group 2 cell lines
SKMEL5 (Fig. 1C), MEL624, UCSD354L, and WM1799 (Supplementary Fig. S1) induced G1 cell cycle arrest, but no significant cell death (sub-G1) was observed up to 3 μmol/L.
The highly resistant group 3 Hs294T cells (Fig. 1D) did not
undergo significant G 1 or sub-G 1 accumulation up to 1
μmol/L AZD6244 (Fig. 1D). Representative cell cycle profile
histograms of AZD6244-treated cells belonging to each group
are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. A cytoplasmic histone-

DNA-fragment-based apoptosis assay confirmed that the
group 1 cells underwent apoptosis, whereas the group 2 and
group 3 cells did not (Supplementary Fig. S3). Time-course
cell cycle analysis of the sensitive cell lines found that cell
death was observed after 48 hours with AZD6244 treatment,
whereas resistant cells showed no significant cell death for
at least 72 hours (Supplementary Fig. S4). Drug washout
experiments with WM35 and A375 showed that drug exposure of 24 to 48 hours was required to induce cell death (data
not shown).
To determine if activation of specific protein signaling
networks correlated with resistance to AZD6244 in the Brafmutant cell lines, we compared the IC50 data (Supplementary
Table S2) for the cell lines with the expression of 99 protein
features determined by RPPA (17, 24). Consistent with previous experiments with other MEK inhibitors (13), we did
not observe a significant correlation between the basal levels
of P-P44/42 MAPK (P = 0.22) or P-MEK1/2 (P = 0.88) and the
degree of growth inhibition. Among all of the proteins
assessed, P-AKT_Thr308 (Pearson r = 0.65, P = 0.02) showed
the highest correlation with resistance to AZD6244. P-AKT_
Ser473 had a similar correlation (r = 0.53, P = 0.08), as did the
AKT substrates P-TSC2 (r = 0.50) and P-GSK3α/β (r = 0.42),
supporting that basal activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway
predicts resistance to AZD6244 in Braf-mutant melanoma
cells (Table 1). The Braf-mutant cell lines with low sensitivity
to AZD6244 (group 2) included the two cell lines with the
highest levels of P-AKT in the panel (WM1799, UCSD-354L).
However, the group 2 cell lines SKMEL5 and MEL624 showed
similar resistance to AZD6244 with normal PTEN expression
and low P-AKT. Additional experiments were performed to
determine the mechanism of resistance in these cell lines.

Treatment-induced changes in signaling pathways
by AZD6244
To identify early and late signaling events that correlate with
cell death induction by AZD6244, we performed RPPA analysis
on A375 and WM35 cells treated with 360 nmol/L AZD6244
for 0.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. Identical experiments were
performed with SKMEL5 and MEL624 cells, which undergo G1
phase growth arrest only in response to AZD6244, and the
highly resistant HS294T cells, which do not die or arrest. Triplicate protein lysates were analyzed, and protein expression levels
for each cell line were normalized to DMSO-treated controls.
We initially analyzed the effects of AZD6244 on the expression of P-P44/42 MAPK. We observed a similar degree (≥90%)
and duration (≥48 hours) of inhibition of P44/42 MAPK phosphorylation in the sensitive and resistant Braf-mutant cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The HS294T cells had much lower
baseline levels of P-MAPK, but this activity was inhibited by
treatment with AZD6244, suggesting that their resistance was
not due to lack of intracellular drug accumulation (Supplementary Fig. S5E–F). To analyze the role of other pathways, we performed hierarchical clustering analysis (by time) of the RPPA
data for each of the cell lines (Fig. 2). Comparison with the completely resistant HS294T cells identified a group of proteins that
were similarly decreased in the other four cell lines, including
P-MAPK, P-YB1, cyclin D1, and P-S6. The HS294T cells showed
a marked increase in P-MEK levels upon treatment with
AZD6244, which was unique compared with the other cell lines.

Patterns of protein expression in the group 1 versus the
group 2 cells were compared to identify signaling events that
might determine cell death induction versus cytostasis with
AZD6244. The MEL624 and SKMEL5 cells, which undergo
G1 arrest but not cell death with AZD6244, showed a timedependent increase in the expression of P-AKT_Ser473 and
P-AKT_Thr308 that was not observed in the WM35 or A375
cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, the WM35 and A375 cells showed
upregulation of PTEN protein expression, as well as cleaved
caspase 7 (apoptosis marker), and p27. Western blotting confirmed the time-dependent increase in P-AKT in the moderately resistant SKMEL5 and MEL624 (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
the highly sensitive WM35, A375 (Fig. 3A), and UACC257 (Supplementary Fig. S6) showed no induction of P-AKT. WM35
cells showed a marked increase in PTEN levels, which was also
detected, but was less dramatic, in A375 and UACC257 cells.
To determine if these effects were specific to these cells, Western blotting was performed on additional cells recently identified to be resistant to AZD6244 (25). The Braf/Nras-wild-type
D24 cells, which were similar to group 2 cells in their relative
sensitivity to growth inhibition and G1 cell cycle arrest (Supplementary Fig. S7), showed increased P-AKT with AZD6244
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6). The Braf-mutant PTEN-expressing D29 cells, which by growth inhibition and cell cycle
were similar to the HS294T cells (Supplementary Fig. S7), did
not show increased P-AKT, but did have increased P-MEK
(Supplementary Fig. S8). The Braf-mutant PTEN-expressing

Activated AKT Mediates Resistance to AZD6244

MM595 and A2 cells also were similar to HS294T in their
growth resistance (Supplementary Fig. S7), but they did not
show an increase in P-AKT or P-MEK (Supplementary Fig. S8).
We further investigated the observed increase in PTEN protein expression in the sensitive cell lines. Reverse transcriptasePCR analysis showed a >6-fold increase in PTEN transcript
levels in the WM35 and A375 cells following AZD6244
treatment, whereas no significant change was observed in
the SKMEL5, MEL624, or HS294T cells (Fig. 3B). To test the
functional significance of PTEN induction, WM35 cells were
transfected with siRNA against PTEN. Knockdown of PTEN
increased the basal levels of P-AKT and reduced the AZD6244induced cleavage of caspase 7 (Fig. 3C). PTEN knockdown
also reduced AZD6244-induced cell killing as measured

by both fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
(Fig. 3D) and apoptosis assay (Fig. 3E).
Inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway sensitizes
melanoma cells to AZD6244
To test if activation of AKT mediated resistance to
AZD6244-induced cell death, SKMEL5 cells were transfected
with siRNA against AKT. Greater than 90% knockdown of
AKT was achieved; decreased expression of P-GSK3α/β
and P-FOXO3a confirmed functional inhibition of AKT activity (Fig. 4A). Compared with transfection with control siRNA,
knockdown of AKT resulted in a slight increase in cell death
(12.5% versus 3.3%), as assessed by FACS analysis (Fig. 4B).
Knockdown of AKT markedly sensitized the SKMEL5 to

Previous studies in human breast cancer cell lines indicated that activation of AKT following MEK inhibition
may be mediated through the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR; ref. 14). Like most melanomas, however,
both the SKMEL5 and MEL624 do not express detectable
EGFR protein by RPPA (data not shown). IGF-I and its
receptor (IGFIR) have been shown to play an important
role in promoting melanoma growth through activation
of the PI3K-AKT pathway (26–28). AZD6244-resistant cells
showed high correlation (Pearson r = 0.55, P = 0.07) with
basal levels of IGFIR protein in the RPPA analysis (Table 1)
and Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S9). The levels of
IGFIR protein were the highest in the group 2 cells MEL624
and SKMEL5, when compared with the other melanoma
cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S9). Knockdown of IGFIR
expression by siRNA abrogated AZD6244-induced P-AKT
expression in the SKMEL5 cells (Fig. 5A). IGFIR inhibition alone resulted in minimal cell death, but increased
cell death in combination with AZD6244 treatment (Fig. 5B

and C). AZD6244 treatment also induced an increase of
IGF-I growth factor secretion into the medium by the moderately resistant cells, and knockdown of IGF-I by siRNA
blocked AZD6244 treatment-induced increase in P-AKT
(Supplementary Fig. S10). Conversely, treatment of the sensitive WM35 cells with recombinant IGF-I induced AKT
activation (Supplementary Fig. S11A) and reduced AZD6244induced apoptosis, but it did not alter the induction of a
G1-phase arrest (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S11B). This
suggests that IGFIR signaling is a critical determinant of
AZD6244-induced cell death, but not the cytostatic effects
of the drug. Of note, we did not detect changes in the total
IGFIR levels or phosphorylation of IGFIR at residues Y1131
and Y1135 following AZD6244 treatment (data not shown),
but this does not preclude the possibility of differential
effects on other phosphorylation sites or other regulators of
this pathway.
AZD8055 is a novel mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) kinase inhibitor that inhibits the activity of both
the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes and therefore inhibits AKT activation (29). Treatment of SKMEL5 cells with
AZD8055 inhibited the AZD6244-induced increase in

P-AKT (S473), whereas P-AKT (T308) was mostly
unchanged (Fig. 6A). Treatment with rapamycin, which
inhibits the mTORC1 but not the mTORC2 complex,
resulted in increased P-AKT at both residues. FACS cell
cycle analysis showed that treatment of SKMEL5 cells with
AZD8055 alone did not result in significant cell death, but it
did when combined with AZD6244 (Fig. 6B). Rapamycin did
not induce cell death, either as a single agent or when combined with AZD6244. Similar results were observed with the
apoptosis assay (Supplementary Fig. S12A). Treatment of
MEL624 cells with AZD8055 also inhibited P-AKT (S473)
expression, whereas the levels of P-AKT (T308) were slightly
increased (Fig. 6C). FACS analysis (Fig. 6D) and apoptosis

creased resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of MEK
inhibition. Although the clinical trials with AZD6244 have
not reported an analysis of the activation status of the
PI3K-AKT pathway in treated patients, we and others have
shown that genetic mutations and constitutive activation of
the PI3K-AKT pathway are present in only a subset of Brafmutant melanomas (17, 23, 32–35). Thus, basal-activation of
the PI3K-AKT pathway is likely not sufficient to fully explain
or predict resistance to AZD6244 in melanoma. We noted that

Discussion
The RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway is an attractive
target for therapy development for melanoma due to the
high prevalence of activation of this pathway. Although the
potent inhibition of this pathway has been shown, AZD6244
had low activity as a single agent in melanoma, even in
patients with Braf mutations. As Braf mutations are the most
common activating mutation in cutaneous melanomas, and
as most evidence supports that they primarily act through
the activation of MEK-MAPK signaling, we performed a
proteomic analysis to explore the role of kinase signaling
pathways in resistance to AZD6244.
Initial testing of the effects of AZD6244 on growth and
survival segregated the Braf-mutant melanoma cell lines into
two groups: group 1 showed marked growth inhibition and
significant cell death induction with nanomolar concentrations of AZD6244, whereas group 2 was less growth inhibited
and exhibited G1 cell cycle arrest but no significant cell death.
We also identified cells (HS294T) that were not growth inhibited significantly by AZD6244 up to micromolar doses, which
were therefore used as a model for effects of AZD6244 in the
absence of any growth inhibitory effects. Previously, we had
performed RPPA analysis of melanoma cell lines for a variety
of proteins in signaling pathways (17). Analysis of basal
protein expression levels identified weak correlation between
levels of P-MEK or P-44/42 MAPK and AZD6244 IC50 values,
similar to previous experiments in melanoma cell lines with
the MEK inhibitor U0126 (13). In contrast, a number of
activation-specific markers of the PI3K-AKT pathway correlated with resistance to AZD6244. Although this study is the
first to report a significant correlation of increased PI3K-AKT
activity with resistance to MEK inhibitors in melanoma, these
results mirror the results recently reported in a study of
AZD6244 in lung cancer cell lines (30). We also observed a
positive correlation for CRAF expression and AZD6244 IC50
values, although it did not quite reach statistical significance
(Table 1). Increased CRAF expression has also been associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors (31).
It is not surprising that Braf-mutant melanoma cells with
concurrent activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway have in-

although the resistant group 2 included two cell lines with
PTEN loss and very high levels of P-AKT, it also included
two cell lines (SKMEL5, MEL624) with normal PTEN and
low basal P-AKT. We therefore performed further testing to
determine possible mechanisms of resistance in these cell
lines by comparing the effects of AZD6244 treatment on
their signaling pathways with effects in sensitive cell lines.
Although all four of these Braf-mutant cell lines showed similar degree and duration of MAPK inhibition and several other
proteins, the resistant cell lines increased their P-AKT levels
following exposure to AZD6244, which was not observed in
the sensitive cell lines. The functional significance of AKT
activation is supported by the fact that inhibition of AKT
activity, either by AKT knockdown or concurrent treatment
with the mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD8055, resulted in synergistic cell killing in the resistant cell lines. These findings give
support for the upcoming clinical trial testing the effects

of AZD6244 and MK2206 (www.clinicaltrials.gov), a small
molecule inhibitor of AKT, as well as further exploration of
the effects of AZD6244 and AZD8055. We also tested signaling effects in additional cell lines recently characterized for
resistance to AZD6244 by another laboratory (25). We found
that several of these cells lines exhibited similar effects to
those observed in our panel. However, the differential results
in the MM595 and A2 cells support the likely existence of
additional resistance mechanisms.
Previous studies in breast cancer cell lines showed that
MEK inhibition resulted in cross-activation of the EGFR
tyrosine growth factor receptor (36). As this receptor is
not frequently expressed in melanoma or in the cell lines
used in this experiment, we hypothesized that other growth
factor receptors could mediate this effect. We tested the role
of the IGF-I pathway, as it previously has been implicated
in AKT activation in melanoma (26–28). Inhibition of IGFIR

did not kill SKMEL5 cells, but it blocked the induction of
P-AKT by AZD6244 and induced cell death in combination
with AZD6244. AZD6244 treatment induced a slight increase
of IGF-I secretion by the cells, and knockdown of IGF-I
also blocked P-AKT induction by AZD6244. Supporting a
specific role for the pathway in cell survival, recombinant
IGF-I treatment blocked AZD6244-induced cell death, but
not growth arrest, in the sensitive WM35. These results
support the need for further testing the effects of combining AZD6244 with inhibition of IGFIR-mediated signaling.
Further work is also merited to better understand the mechanism of cross-talk to this pathway, to help identify and
assess optimal combinatorial approaches. Additional testing will also be needed to determine if this combinatorial
approach is most effective in melanomas with elevated
IGFIR expression.
Our finding that MEK inhibitor treatment can induce the
upregulation of PTEN transcript and protein is unprecedented. The mechanism(s) of the transcriptional regulation
of PTEN remains poorly understood. Although several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to regulate PTEN tran-

script stability (37–39), our profiling of eight miRNAs that
recognize sites in the PTEN message (miR-10a, -26a, -29a,
-30a-3p, -30e-3p, -183, -221, and -519d) did not show changes
or differential effects that would explain the observed differences in PTEN expression (data not shown). Understanding
these effects may require more comprehensive miRNA profiling, or functional analysis of the PTEN promoter. Identification of molecular features that predict the upregulation of
PTEN expression with MEK inhibition may indicate patients
who would selectively benefit from treatment with these
agents. Such markers would need to be validated in larger
panels of cell lines and patients.
These studies have provided new insights into the regulation of the growth inhibitory effects of AZD6244 in melanoma. We specifically focused these studies on Braf-mutant
melanoma cells as these mutations are predominant in the
common cutaneous melanomas, and ongoing clinical trials
with AZD6244 require Braf mutation for patient enrollment.
However, there is a clear need to determine if similar effects
and combinations are important in other melanoma genotypes,
including Nras-mutants and melanomas in which activating

kinase mutations are not detected. Further, although RPPA is
a powerful technology that can be used to investigate both the
expression and the activation states of proteins, we recognize
that its scope is limited to investigations of targets for
which validated antibodies are available. Whole-genomic
approaches, such as mRNA or miRNA profiling, may suggest
additional pathways that regulate sensitivity to AZD6244
in Braf-mutant melanomas. At the protein level, there remains a strong rationale to determine if the differential
clinical outcomes seen with RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway inhibitors in vivo correlate with a threshold level of pathway
inhibition. However, our functional testing of off-target
pathways that are activated by, and correlate with resistance to, AZD6244 supports performing similar investigations with other agents. We believe this approach will

identify combinatorial approaches with increased efficacy
for this highly aggressive disease.
