Abstract
Poor chemosensitivity and the development of chemoresistance remain major obstacles to successful chemotherapy of
malignant gliomas. GRP78 is a key regulator of the unfolded
protein response (UPR). As a Ca2+-binding molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), GRP78 maintains ER
homeostasis, suppresses stress-induced apoptosis, and controls UPR signaling. We report here that GRP78 is expressed
at low levels in normal adult brain, but is significantly
elevated in malignant glioma specimens and human malignant glioma cell lines, correlating with their rate of proliferation. Down-regulation of GRP78 by small interfering RNA
leads to a slowdown in glioma cell growth. Our studies further
reveal that temozolomide, the chemotherapeutic agent of
choice for treatment of malignant gliomas, leads to induction
of CHOP, a major proapoptotic arm of the UPR. Knockdown
of GRP78 in glioblastoma cell lines induces CHOP and activates caspase-7 in temozolomide-treated cells. Colony survival assays further establish that knockdown of GRP78 lowers
resistance of glioma cells to temozolomide, and, conversely,
overexpression of GRP78 confers higher resistance. Knockdown of GRP78 also sensitizes glioma cells to 5-fluorouracil
and CPT-11. Treatment of glioma cells with ( )-epigallocatechin gallate, which targets the ATP-binding domain of
GRP78 and blocks its protective function, sensitizes glioma
cells to temozolomide. These results identify a novel chemoresistance mechanism in malignant gliomas and show that
combination of drugs capable of suppressing GRP78 with
conventional agents such as temozolomide might represent a
novel approach to eliminate residual tumor cells after surgery
and increase the effectiveness of malignant glioma chemotherapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9809–16]

Introduction
Malignant gliomas are the most commonly diagnosed malignant
adult primary brain tumors, including anaplastic astrocytoma
(grade 3) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; grade 4). Median survival for GBM is f12 to 15 months. Surgical resection or diagnostic
biopsy is usually the first step in therapy, followed by adjuvant

radiation and chemotherapy (1). Despite significant improvements
in the surgical treatment of malignant gliomas, a complete resection is impossible; after diffuse brain invasion, cells were often
found at great distances from the site of the major tumor (2).
Because a cure remains elusive, it is important to identify new
treatment modalities, as well as to modify existing therapies, to
possibly change malignant gliomas from a deadly disease into a
chronic one. A promising approach to achieving these goals is to
enhance glioma chemosensitivity to existing treatment regimens.
Temozolomide (Temodar) is currently the standard of care for
treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent malignant gliomas.
This well-tolerated drug has been shown to delay tumor progression and prolong patient survival (3). The action of temozolomide is associated with its ability to damage DNA through DNA
methylation and subsequent substitution of cytosine by thymine.
This leads to the activation of the mismatch repair mechanism,
which recognizes a recurring error and triggers apoptosis (4).
In patient samples, resistance to temozolomide in GBMs has been
linked to expression of O 6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (5).
The unfolded protein response (UPR) consists of a set of
adaptive pathways that are triggered by disparate perturbations in
normal function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that lead to the
production of misfolded proteins. The UPR alleviates ER stress by
arresting general translation, up-regulation of chaperones and
folding enzymes, and degradation of misfolded proteins; however,
in the case of intense or persistent ER stress, the UPR will trigger
apoptosis resulting in cell death (6). A major UPR target is the
induction of the glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78/BiP), which
has important roles in protein folding and assembly, targeting
misfolded proteins for degradation, ER Ca 2+ binding, and
controlling the activation of transmembrane ER stress sensors
(7). Thus, GRP78 represents a prosurvival arm of the UPR. On the
other hand, the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous
transcription factor (CHOP/GADD153) is one of the critical
executioners of the proapoptotic arm of the UPR (8). Induction
of CHOP signals that the cells are experiencing ER stress and hence
initiating the cell death process.
As malignant gliomas represent tumors that are highly resistant
to chemotherapy and elimination of residual tumor cells remains a
major challenge, we initiated this study to determine whether
GRP78 plays a role in the chemoresistance of such cancers. Here,
we provide evidence that malignant glioma cells overexpress
GRP78. Our results reveal that knockdown of GRP78 suppresses
glioma cell proliferation, induces CHOP, and activates caspase-7 in
temozolomide-treated cells. Through colony survival assays, we
have established that manipulation of GRP78 levels alters the sensitivity of glioma cells to temozolomide and other chemotherapeutic agents. Further, combination treatment of glioma cells with
temozolomide and ( )-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a known

inhibitor of the protective function of GRP78 (9), sensitizes glioma
cells to temozolomide. These results show that GRP78 status is a
potential prognostic marker for malignant gliomas and that GRP78
is a novel chemosensitizing target for malignant brain tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, culture, and drug treatment conditions. U87 cell lines were
obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. All other malignant glioma cell lines were provided by Frank B. Furnari and Webster K.
Cavenee (Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research, La Jolla, CA). The cells
were propagated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 units/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin at 37jC, and 5% CO2.
Human astrocytes and the astrocyte medium, in which astrocytes were
grown, were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories. Temozolomide (Temodar) was purchased from Schering Plough and dissolved in
DMSO as a 25 mmol/L stock solution. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and irinotecan
(CPT-11) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Immunoblots and antibodies. Fifty micrograms of total cell lysate
prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer were processed for
Western blot analysis as described (10). The antibodies against GRP78,
CHOP, actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and caspase-7 (BD
PharMingen) were used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
The secondary antibodies were coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and
were detected by chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal West substrate
(Pierce). Each immunoblot was done at least twice to confirm the results.
The blots were quantified using ImageJ software (11).
Immunohistochemistry. Malignant glioma tissues were obtained from
glioblastoma patients undergoing primary resection or biopsy of their
tumor. No exposure to radiation or chemotherapy had been experienced by
this group of patients. The peritumoral tissue was obtained from patients

undergoing a partial or full lobectomy for their GBM. Consent for use of
tissue specimens was obtained from the University of Southern California
Institutional Review Board. Immunohistochemical analysis of GRP78
expression in tumor tissues and cell lines was done with anti-GRP78
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:100 in 2% goat blocking
serum as described (12). Specificity of the antibody was tested as previously
described (12).
Transfections. For knockdown of GRP78, the glioblastoma cells were
transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against GRP78: sense 5¶-GGAGCGCAUUGAUACUAGATT-3¶ and antisense 5¶-UCUAGUAUCAAUGCGCUCCTT-3¶ (13). The siRNA targeted against green fluorescent protein
(GFP) purchased from Qiagen served as negative control. A final
concentration of 80 nmol/L was used for both siRNAs. Transfections were
done in six-well plates following Qiagen’s instructions. Ten microliters of
each siRNA were used with 5 AL of Lipofectamine 2000 per well.
Lentivirus infection. Lentiviruses expressing siRNA against GRP78 as
described above or full-length human GRP78 were constructed as described
(14). All lentiviral constructs expressed GFP. For infection, 104 cells were
plated in six-well plates and infected with the lentivirus at titers of 5  106
units/mL. Infected cells were monitored for GFP under the fluorescence
microscope.
Colony formation assays. Twenty-four hours after transfection with
siRNA, the cells were seeded in six-well plates at 200 cells per well (when
higher concentrations of temozolomide were used, appropriately increased
numbers of cells were seeded). The next day, the medium was changed
to include 20 to 160 Amol/L temozolomide. After a change of fresh medium
48 h later, the cells were allowed to form colonies for 14 days in the absence
of drug. The colonies were stained with 1% methylene blue (in methanol)
for 4 h and then counted. The experiments were done in three or six
replicates and each experiment was done at least twice. Statistical analysis
was done using Student’s t test, two-tailed distribution, assuming equal
variance for the samples.

Down-regulation of GRP78 was confirmed by Western blot (bottom ).

Results
Elevation of GRP78 levels in human glioma tissue specimens.
Tumor specimens from patients undergoing craniotomy before
adjunctive therapy, including radiation and chemotherapy, were
examined using both Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry to determine whether GRP78 is up-regulated in human
glioma tissue. The Western blot results show that GRP78 level was
generally elevated with varying degrees in the glioma tissues
(Fig. 1A). For example, compared with normal brain tissue where
GRP78 was below detection limit, specimens 4 and 6 showed high
GRP78 level, specimens 2 and 3 showed intermediate level, specimen 1 was at low level, and specimen 5 was at very low level.
GRP78 overexpression was confirmed by immunohistochemical
staining of tissue sections from human glioma specimens that were
different from those used in the Western blots. All four sections
were positive for GRP78 staining (Fig. 1B). In agreement with the

www.aacrjournals.org

immunoblot result, peritumoral brain tissue showed very little
GRP78 staining (Fig. 1B). These results reveal that GRP78 is highly
elevated in this sample of human malignant gliomas.
GRP78 expression level correlates with proliferation rates
and is required for glioma cell growth. A panel of malignant
glioma cell lines was tested for GRP78 expression in Western blot
analysis to address whether human glioma cells constitutively
express this protein and at what level. The results show that compared with human astrocytes grown under normal culture conditions, five of the six glioma cell lines constitutively expressed
higher level of GRP78, with the apparent exception of the U138 cell
line (Fig. 2A). The level of GRP78 overexpression ranged from 2- to
3-fold, with the upper range comparable with the level of GRP78
induction observed in human astrocytes treated with thapsigargin,
an inhibitor of the ER Ca2+-ATPase, and an established ER stress
inducer. Interestingly, the level of GRP78 overexpression in glioma
cell lines seems to correlate with their rate of proliferation. For

example, highly replicating lines (U251, LN229, T98G, U87, and
A172) with relatively shorter doubling times (19, 22, 22, 24, and
37.5 h, respectively) showed higher level of GRP78 (3-, 2-, 2-, 2-,
and 1.5-fold increase) compared with the slower replicating U138
cells, which have a doubling time of >80 h, for which the GRP78
level was similar to the baseline control. Doubling times of U251,
T98G, A172, and U87 cells had previously been reported and were
confirmed in our laboratory (15–17). Doubling times of U138 and
LN229 cells were obtained in our laboratory.
To confirm the immunoblot results, immunohistochemical
staining was done. Human astrocytes grown under normal conditions and treated with thapsigargin were used as negative and
positive controls, respectively (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, the
majority (>90%) of U251 cells stained positively for GRP78; the
majority of T98G, LN229, and U-87 cells (>70%) also stained
positively for GRP78. A172 cells showed intermediate staining,
with f25% of the cells stained. By contrast, U138 cell staining
was comparable with the negative control with only an occasional
positive cell, consistent with the immunoblot results. The cellular
staining pattern of GRP78 was perinuclear, within the cytosol,
demonstrating a staining pattern consistent with ER localization.
GRP78 was down-regulated using specific GRP78 siRNA
(siGRP78) to determine whether it was required for glioma cell
growth. Two glioma cell lines (U87 and U251) were examined
(Fig. 2D). Twenty-four hours posttransfection, equal numbers of
cells transfected with siGRP78 or an siRNA directed against GFP
(siCtrl) were plated in six-well plates. Subsequently, one-well per
group was trypsinized and counted each day for 3 days and the
numbers of cells were plotted against time. Down-regulation of
GRP78 resulted in a slower growth rate for both cell lines, with the
effect being more severe in U251 than in U87 cells, correlating with
near-complete versus partial knockdown of GRP78 in U251 and
U87 cells, respectively (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data show

that the majority of malignant glioma cell lines express elevated
levels of GRP78 protein, with the fastest proliferating cells
exhibiting the highest level of overexpression. In addition, downregulation of GRP78 protein levels results in a significant slowing
down of the glioma cell growth.
Temozolomide treatment of glioma cells induces CHOP/
GADD153 and GRP78. Temozolomide is widely used as an
antiglioma drug. The effect of temozolomide on GRP78 (i.e., the
protective arm of the UPR) as well as on CHOP (i.e., the
proapoptotic component of the UPR) were examined to determine
whether this drug would impinge on ER stress or UPR levels. First,
U87 cells were treated with a range (30–500 Amol/L) of temozolomide concentrations for 72 h, and then subjected to Western
blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, CHOP induction was dramatically stimulated by temozolomide in a dosage-dependent
manner, whereas a moderate induction of GRP78 was detected in
parallel. We then tested whether this observation is applicable to
other glioma cells and to determine the kinetics of CHOP and
GRP78 induction. U251 cells were incubated with 250 Amol/L of
temozolomide from 4 to 72 h. The results showed that
temozolomide could induce GRP78 and CHOP in the U251 cells;
the induction became evident after 36 h, and intensified and
persisted at least through 72 h of treatment (Fig. 3B). Thus, the
induction of the representative UPR markers GRP78 and CHOP
indicates that temozolomide is a novel inducer of the ER stress
response.
Interestingly, the suppression of GRP78 expression with the use
of siRNA resulted in a substantial increase in CHOP levels in U251
cells, even in the absence of any drug treatment (Fig. 3C). This
result was consistently obtained in U87 and LN229 cells as well
(data not shown). Therefore, GRP78 suppresses CHOP induction.
GRP78 is known to interact with procaspase-7, suppressing its
activation (9, 18, 19). U251 cells infected with lentivirus expressing

as in A. Columns, mean value of three and

siRNA against GRP78 (L-siGRP78) or the GFP alone (L-GFP) were
treated with temozolomide. Whole cellular lysates were analyzed
by Western blot with antibodies to GRP78 and caspase-7. The
cells that detached and were floating in the medium were included
in this analysis. We observed significant caspase-7 cleavage in
temozolomide-treated U251 cells in which GRP78 level was downregulated by siRNA (Fig. 3D). These results imply that elevated level
of GRP78 in gliomas may contribute to increased resistance to cell
death of these tumor cells.
Knockdown of GRP78 or treatment with EGCG sensitizes
gliomas to temozolomide. GRP78 knockdown experiments were
done to test directly whether gliomas depend on GRP78 for
protection against temozolomide-mediated cell death. U251, U87,
and LN229 glioma cells were transfected with siRNA targeted
against human GRP78 (siGRP78) or control siRNA (siCtrl) targeted
at GFP. Colony survival assays were done using a range of temozolomide concentrations to evaluate the drug sensitivity of the
transfected cells (Fig. 4A–C). Western blot assays verified that

www.aacrjournals.org

siRNA against GRP78 was highly effective in suppressing GRP78
expression in all three cell lines (Fig. 4A–C). The results showed
that suppression of GRP78 expression caused a statistically
significant increase in drug sensitivity in all three glioma cell lines
tested, indicating a critical role of GRP78 as a protector against
the cytotoxic effects of temozolomide. To determine whether
GRP78 protection extends to drugs other than temozolomide, the
same cells were treated with 5-FU or CPT-11. Down-regulation of
GRP78 resulted in increased sensitivity of LN229 cell to both drugs
(Fig. 4C). Treatment of cells with these drugs did not result in
induction of ER stress markers (data not shown).
As a direct test that GRP78 overexpression protects glioma cells
against temozolomide-induced cell death, U251 cells were infected
with a lentivirus expressing human GRP78 (L-GRP78) or a control
vector expressing GFP alone (L-GFP). Colony survival assays were
done using a range of temozolomide concentrations to evaluate the
drug sensitivity of the infected cells (Fig. 5). Western blot assay
verified that infection with L-GRP78 increased the level of GRP78

well for 20, 40, 60, 80, and 160 Amol/L temozolomide,
respectively), were seeded in a six-well plate. Twenty-four

protein by f2-fold. The results showed that elevation of GRP78
level caused a statistically significant protection from temozolomide-induced cell death in U251 cells.
Our results predict that down-regulation of GRP78 by compounds directed against GRP78 expression or activity could lead to
increased chemosensitivity of glioma cells to temozolomide. One
such compound is EGCG, which directly interacts with the ATPbinding domain of intracellular GRP78, blocking its interaction with
procaspase-7 and suppressing the protective function of GRP78 (9).
In colony survival assays, concomitant treatment of U251 cells with
temozolomide and EGCG led to increases in temozolomide
chemosensitivity (Fig. 6A and B). Importantly, EGCG at the effective
concentrations did not cause cell death in U251 cells by itself. The
combination of EGCG and temozolomide, however, caused significantly more cell death than temozolomide alone. These results
imply that combination of drugs capable of GRP78 suppression
could sensitize glioma cells to temozolomide.

Discussion
Gliomas, and GBM in particular, are among the most chemoresistant tumors (20). In this study, we have made several new
observations, which may have important prognostic and therapeutic applications. In our survey of several malignant glioma cell lines,
GRP78 overexpression was generally observed and this overexpression was independent of their p53 or PTEN status. Our
results showed that glioma cell lines with rapid proliferation rates
had the highest levels of GRP78 expression. In addition, downregulation of GRP78 led to a significant decrease in glioma cell
growth. Varying levels of elevated GRP78 expression were also
detected in patient biopsies before adjuvant treatment. Taken
together, our results raise the possibility that the level of GRP78 in
patient biopsies could be used as a predictive factor of
aggressiveness of the glioblastoma, independent of their p53 and
PTEN status. Our findings predict that tumors with low GRP78
expression represent slow growing, less aggressive tumors, whereas

GRP78 and Chemosensitivity in Malignant Glioma

those with high GRP78 are rapidly proliferating, aggressive tumors.
Furthermore, elevated GRP78 expression in highly proliferating
tumors may provide malignant gliomas with a possible protective
mechanism against cytotoxic drugs such as temozolomide.
Cytotoxic drugs that induce DNA mismatch work best in rapidly
proliferating cells. Rapidly proliferating malignant glioma cells are
expected to be more chemosensitive to temozolomide but they
may also be protected from temozolomide by higher GRP78 levels.
An important question arises as to how GRP78, an ER molecular
chaperone, protects gliomas against temozolomide, a DNAdamaging agent. Our studies suggest that several novel mechanisms may be involved. Evidence is emerging that some therapeutic
agents recognized as working through DNA damage can also elicit
cytosolic stress independent of the nucleus. For example, cisplatin
can induce apoptosis in the absence of DNA damage, at least in
part through activation of ER stress as evidenced by GRP78
induction and activation of the ER-associated caspase-12 (21).
Our discovery that temozolomide is an inducer of both GRP78
and CHOP suggests that it also causes ER stress. The ER could
be a direct target site of temozolomide or temozolomide may
indirectly elicit ER stress acting through other cellular pathways.
Recently, Das et al. (22) reported that temozolomide treatment
at 100 Amol/L for 6 h leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ levels
and higher expression of proapoptotic markers. Elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels have been reported to activate the ER stress
response, as exemplified by ATF6 cleavage and GRP78 induction
(23). GRP78 is known to function as a Ca2+-binding protein in the
ER, thereby preventing Ca2+ efflux into the cytosol. In such capacity, GRP78 may provide a buffer against temozolomide-induced
increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, thereby suppressing apoptosis. In
addition, ER stress causes protein misfolding in the ER. GRP78, in
its capacity as a major ER molecular chaperone, offers protection
against ER stress and suppresses apoptosis.
The mechanism of cell death and resistance to temozolomide is
just emerging and is likely to be complex, involving apoptotic as
well as nonapoptotic pathways (5, 22, 24). In the glioma cell lines,
temozolomide induces CHOP, which as a transcription factor,
sensitizes cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis through downregulation of BCL-2 and activation of GADD34 and ER01a, an ER
oxidase (25, 26), and this may represent a new antitumoral
mechanism of temozolomide. Our studies reveal that CHOP is
constitutively suppressed by GRP78 in glioblastoma. Further,
temozolomide treatment leads to activation of caspase-7 when
GRP78 level is down-regulated in glioma cells. In view that GRP78
also protects glioma cells against drugs such as 5-FU and CPT-11,
which do not induce ER stress, pathways independent of ER stress
are likely to be affected by GRP78. These may include its role in cell
proliferation and other yet unknown mechanisms (27–30).

Because GRP78 provides protection to tumor cells and endows
them with increased chemoresistance, down-regulation of GRP78,
therefore, may become an important adjunct in future treatments
of malignant gliomas. Our results with siGRP78 show that lowering
GRP78 levels significantly increases chemosensitivity to temozolomide. Recent developments of small molecules that can specifically
block GRP78 expression and/or its activity may make this
approach clinically feasible in the near future (9, 30–34). Recently,
Ermakova et al. (9) showed that EGCG, a major component of
green tea, can bind to intracellular GRP78, inhibit its protective
function, and increase chemosensitivity to etoposide in breast and
bladder carcinoma cell lines. In our study, we showed that
treatment with EGCG had similar effects as down-regulation of
GRP78 by siRNA such that cells treated with the combination of
EGCG and temozolomide exhibited more cell death than cells
treated with temozolomide alone. EGCG alone did not cause any
cell death in glioma cells. EGCG is a water-soluble molecule that
may potentially be formulated for i.v. infusions. As a small
molecule, it should cross the blood-brain barrier readily. Further
in vivo studies, including toxicity studies on systemic EGCG
administration, are pending. Thus, in our study, we present a target
for increasing glioma cell sensitivity to temozolomide (GRP78), and
a clinically feasible way to affect this target (treatment with EGCG)
in gliomas. Other agents, such as ABT 828, recombinant human
plasminogen Kringle 5, has been recently used in phase I/II studies
in various carcinomas. Preclinical studies showed that GRP78 is the
receptor for Kringle 5, which induces apoptosis of fibrosarcoma
and growth-stimulated endothelial cells (18). Its mechanism of
action has been hypothesized to be secondary to binding of surface
GRP78, internalization of ABT 828 into the cytosol, and blocking
of GRP78 binding to the proapoptotic molecule procaspase-7.
Combining these and other drugs that can suppress GRP78 with
conventional agents, such as temozolomide, may present a novel
approach to the elimination of residual tumor cells after surgery,
and thereby increase the effectiveness of malignant glioma
chemotherapy.
