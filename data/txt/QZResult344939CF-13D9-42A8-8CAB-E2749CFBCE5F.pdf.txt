Abstract
Tumorigenesis can arise from inappropriate activation of
developmental genes in mature tissues. Here, we show that
the developmental regulator Six1 is overexpressed in ovarian
carcinoma cell lines (OCC) compared with normal ovarian
surface epithelium. As observed in other cancers, Six1
overexpression in OCC leads to increased A-type cyclin
expression and increased proliferation. In addition, Six1
overexpression renders OCC resistant to tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)–mediated
apoptosis, and Six1 knockdown in the TRAIL-resistant SKOV3
ovarian carcinoma line dramatically sensitizes the cells to
TRAIL. Because inactivation of the TRAIL response has been
linked to metastasis, and because antibodies and recombinant
ligand that activate the TRAIL pathway are currently in
clinical trials against ovarian carcinoma, we screened normal
ovarian and carcinoma specimens for Six1 mRNA. Six1 was
overexpressed in 50% of the early-stage (stage I) and 63% of
the late-stage (stages II, III, and IV) ovarian carcinomas
examined, with late-stage carcinomas expressing f3-fold
higher Six1 mRNA levels on average compared with earlystage tumors. Importantly, in patients with late-stage disease,
high Six1 expression was associated with significantly
shortened survival (P = 0.0015). These data suggest that Six1
may contribute to ovarian epithelial carcinogenesis by
simultaneously increasing proliferation and decreasing
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and imply that Six1 may be an
important determinant of TRAIL therapy response that
should be considered in patient selection for TRAIL-related
clinical trials. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):3036–42]

Introduction
Ovarian carcinoma is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy and
the fourth leading cause of death due to cancer in women (1).
Because ovarian cancer is often diagnosed only after the disease
has reached an advanced stage, the majority of patients require
additional treatment after surgical removal of the tumor. Although

more than 70% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer respond
to primary chemotherapy, most of them ultimately develop
resistance, leading to an overall 5-year survival rate below 20%
(2). For this reason, novel approaches are being sought to overcome
chemoresistance and to develop more effective therapies.
Currently, biological therapies are being considered as the next
approach in the fight against ovarian cancer. These therapies have
the potential to selectively target tumors, to minimize toxicity, and
to overcome the resistance often observed with conventional
therapies (3). One such therapy involves activating the tumor
necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) pathway
that selectively induces apoptosis in tumor cells while sparing
normal cells. Specifically, TRAIL triggers apoptosis rapidly through
the extrinsic apoptotic pathway mediated by the death receptors
DR4 and DR5 on the cell membrane (4–6). Upon TRAIL-mediated
activation of the death receptor, its intracellular death domain
attracts the Fas-associated death domain adaptor molecule (7, 8),
which further recruits the initiator caspase-8 and caspase-10 to the
death receptor to form the death-inducing signaling complex. This
process ultimately results in the activation of the terminal
executioner caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7, thereby leading
to cell death (9). Importantly, cell culture and mouse xenograft
experiments have shown that TRAIL can exert selective cytotoxic
activity against ovarian carcinoma cells with limited effects to
normal cells (10).
TRAIL has been implicated in several aspects of tumorigenesis,
including innate immunosurveillance against tumors (11) and
inhibition of tumor initiation and metastases (11), and in response
to conventional chemotherapy (12, 13). For example, TRAILdeficient mice show increased tumor susceptibility in response to
the chemical carcinogen methylchloanthrene and increased
experimental and spontaneous metastasis (11). In addition,
mutations in TRAIL receptors have been linked to metastatic
breast cancer (14). Thus, activating the TRAIL pathway clinically
could induce cell death and prevent metastatic disease, and those
tumors that devise mechanisms to escape TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis might be more metastatic.
In this study, we show that the homeoprotein Six1, an important
developmental regulator (15–20), is a modulator of the TRAIL
pathway. Six1 is expressed during embryogenesis (21) but lost in
most differentiated tissues (22) and has been implicated in the
etiology of numerous cancers, including breast cancer (22–24) and
rhabdomyosarcoma (25, 26). During normal development, Six1
stimulates the proliferation and survival of progenitor cells
(17–20), and when expressed out of context, Six1 can aberrantly
promote proliferation, contributing to tumorigenesis (23, 26).
These observations have led us to postulate that inappropriate

Six1 Confers TRAIL Resistance in Ovarian Cancers

Six1 expression in adult differentiated tissues results in the
acquisition of an embryonic program of cell expansion that
contributes to cancer. Here, we show that Six1 expression is
related to the tumorigenicity of ovarian carcinoma, and that it not
only increases ovarian carcinoma cell proliferation, but that it also
protects ovarian carcinoma cells from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
As resistance to TRAIL is associated with metastatic disease, these
findings suggest that Six1 contributes to late-stage ovarian
carcinoma (characterized by loco-regional peritoneal dissemination) by conferring resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
Furthermore, these finding have important implications for the
use of TRAIL reagents in ovarian cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. The ovarian carcinoma cell lines (OCC)
CaOV3 and SKOV3 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Rockville, MD). The cell line SNU251 (27) was provided by Dr.
Jeffrey Holt (University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences, Denver,
CO). Cell lines were maintained in DMEM (CaOV3) or McCoy’s 5-a (SKOV3)
or RPMI 1640 + 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium A (SNU251), all with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 37jC and 5% CO2. Ovarian surface epithelial (OSE)
cells were harvested from patients undergoing oophorectomy as previously
described (28). Epithelial origin was verified by pan-cytokeratin staining.
Transfection for Six1 overexpression and knockdown. Full-length
Six1 cDNA (SIXFL; ref. 22) or control pcDNA3.1(CAT) plasmids were
transfected into 1  106 CaOV3 or SNU251 cells using Superfect according
to manufacturer specifications (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transfectants were
selected with 400 Ag/mL G418. Approximately 2 weeks later, individual
clones were isolated and propagated. Six1 expression was verified by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, Northern blot, and Western blot.
Transient transfections for short interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments
were done as follows: SKOV3 cells were resuspended at 3  106 per mL of
electroporation buffer [2 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.2), 15 mmol/L K2HPO4/
KH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 250 mmol/L mannitol, 1 mmol/L MgCl2]. Cell solution
(800 AL) was added to 16 Ag DNA: either pSUPER Six1C, pSUPER Six1F, or
pSUPER luciferase (description of constructs in Supplementary Table S2).
Cells were then electroporated in 4-mm gap electroporation cuvettes at 250
V (2-ms duration, 1.5-s intervals, 15 times) and transferred to plates with
warmed DMEM + 10% FBS. Knockdown of Six1 was confirmed by Western
blotting of nuclear extracts both at the time TRAIL treatment (see below)
and at the time of completion of the TRAIL assay. Functionality of the
pSUPER Luciferase construct was tested by cotransfection with a cyclin D1promoter luciferase-expressing construct [CD1-Luc, a kind gift from Justin
Lamb (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) and Mark Ewen (Dana Farber
Cancer Institute, Boston, MA)] followed by analysis of luciferase activity.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. Total
RNA was extracted from cultured cell lines or patient specimens stored in
RNAlater using standard TRIzol extraction (Invitrogen/Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA). Purity, concentration, and integrity of total RNA was verified
using a spectrophotometer as well as the RNA 6000 Nano assay (Agilent
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and visualization of the 18S and 28S rRNA
bands. Northern blot analysis was done as previously described using 15 Ag
of high-quality RNA per sample (22) and standardized with h-actin and
ethidium bromide staining. For quantitative RT-PCR, 1 Ag of extracted RNA
was analyzed by rRNA amplification to verify integrity of the RNA. Highquality specimens were then analyzed for Six1 mRNA levels using the ABI
Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) and Six1-specific primers and Taqman probes (primers and probes are
listed in Supplementary Table S3). Six1 cDNA and control rRNA standard
curves were generated with each experiment. Results are reported as fg
Six1/ng 18S rRNA. Experiments were repeated in triplicate, and representative experiments are shown.
Protein isolation and Western blots. For whole-cell lysates, samples
were lysed on ice in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (29). Nuclear
extracts were done by the Dignam method (30). Protein concentration was

www.aacrjournals.org

determined by the Lowry method (31). Thirty micrograms of each protein
sample were loaded on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride. Membranes were probed with antibodies to Six1
(32) and to cyclin A1 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and were
normalized to h-actin (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO).
Proliferation assays. Cells (10,000 per well) in six-well plates were
seeded. Cells were counted with trypan blue dye exclusion at days 1, 3, and
5. Counts were reported as means of three to six wells. Each cell growth
assay was repeated at least once, at least in triplicate. For assessment of the
percentage of cells in the cell cycle using Ki67 staining (DAKO Corp.,
Carpinteria, CA), immunocytochemistry was done on 5- to 8-Am sections of
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell blocks of cultured cells. Sections
were developed using the ABC method (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Three randomly selected 160
fields per slide were analyzed visually by a blinded observer, and percentage
of stained cells was quantified and analyzed.
Detection of apoptotic cell death. Cell lines were plated in chambered
slides in duplicate in at least two separate experiments. Once the cells
reached 70% confluency, they were fixed with 40 g/L PBS buffered 4%
formaldehyde for 20 min, after which they were stained with Hoechst 33258
(10 mg/L). Slides were then examined using fluorescence microscopy.
Apoptotic cells were defined based on condensed nuclear morphology. Six
random fields at 100 magnification were counted per slide by a blinded
observer, and the number of apoptotic cells per total nuclei was recorded.
Dose-response curves for TRAIL- and Fas ligand–mediated growth
inhibition. For CaOV3 and SNU251 transfectants, 5,000 cells were plated in
each well of a 96-well plate and treated with varying concentrations of fulllength recombinant soluble TRAIL (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), Fas
ligand (FasL; Alexis-Axxora, San Diego, CA), or media + DMSO for 40 h. Cell
viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay (Promega, Madison, WI). For SKOV3 cells in which Six1 was knocked down, 1,000 cells per
well were plated as above 48 h after electroporation. The rest of the assay
was done as outlined for CaOV3 and SNU251 cells. Means of five–six wells
are reported and experiments were repeated at least once in quintuplet or
sextuplet. Representative dose-response curves are shown.
Patient specimens. Fresh tissue specimens were obtained under an
approved Institutional Review Board protocol immediately after evaluation
by a pathologist and stored in RNAlater stabilization buffer (Qiagen). Staging
was done by one of two authors (K.B. or S.D.). A portion of each specimen
was mounted in ornithine carbamyl transferase compound, snap-frozen, and
stored at 80jC, and another portion was fixed in formalin and paraffin
embedded. Sections (5–8 Am) were cut and verified using H&E staining.
Statistical analysis. Results were compared using Student’s t test and
one-way ANOVA for normally distributed variables and m2, Fischer’s exact
test, and Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric variables. Survival data
were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with analysis of significance
via the log-rank test. The SPSS (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) data analysis
software was used.

Results
Six1 is expressed in epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines
but not in cultured normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. The
Six1 homeobox gene is overexpressed in a number of cancers,
including breast (22) and hepatocellular (33) carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma (26, 34), and Wilms’ tumor (35). Because numerous
tumorigenic mechanisms are shared between breast and ovarian
carcinoma (36, 37), we set out to determine whether Six1 is
overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma. To this end, we examined the
expression of Six1 in a number of OCC and cultured normal OSE
cells. We found that Six1 mRNA, as measured by both Northern
blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1) and quantitative RT-PCR
(Fig. 1A), is increased in OCC (CaOV3, SKOV3, and SNU251)
compared with OSE. Figure 1B shows that SIX1 protein expression
follows the same pattern with highest levels observed in the

SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma cell line, an ovarian cancer line that is
relatively resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, particularly when
compared with the low Six1-expressing and TRAIL-sensitive
CaOV3 cells (38). No information on TRAIL sensitivity was
available for SNU251 cells before this work.
Six1 overexpression promotes a proliferative and antiapoptotic phenotype in ovarian carcinoma cells. To determine
whether Six1 overexpression contributes to the tumorigenic
phenotype and, more specifically, to resistance to TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis, we next overexpressed Six1 in both CaOV3 and SNU251
cells, both of which express Six1 endogenously but at lower levels
than the SKOV3 cell line. Stable Six1 and control chloramphenicol
acetyl transferase (CAT) transfectants were generated and
examined for Six1 mRNA and protein as shown in Fig. 1C and D
and in Supplementary Fig. S2A. Two stable Six1-overexpressing
clones and two CAT control clones from each line (CaOV3 and
SNU251) were chosen for further analyses. The levels of overexpression of Six1 ( fg/ng rRNA) achieved in these CaOV3 and
SNU251 clones were less than or equivalent to the level of
expression of endogenous Six1 mRNA in SKOV3 cells as
determined by quantitative RT-PCR (average level of Six1
expression in SNU 251-Six1 clones = 262 fg/ng rRNA, CaOV3-Six1
clones = 395 fg/ng rRNA, and SKOV3 = 437 fg/ng rRNA), showing
that we overexpressed the gene at the physiologic levels expressed
in the TRAIL-resistant SKOV3 cells.
Six1 promotes the proliferation of precursor cells in normal
development (15–20) and contributes to breast cancer (22, 23) and
rhabdomyosarcoma (26) cell proliferation. Before examining the
effect of Six1 on TRAIL sensitivity, we first wished to determine if
Six1 influences the proliferative potential of OCC, as it does in
breast cancer and rhabdomyosarcoma. To this end, we compared
the growth of CaOV3-Six1 and SNU251-Six1 cells with CaOV3-CAT
and SNU251-CAT control cells. The Six1-overexpressing cells
increased in number at a faster rate than CAT control cells in
both cell lines (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2B). To determine
whether Six1 overexpression influences proliferation per se in OCC

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

as opposed to simply decreasing apoptosis, we measured the
proliferative index of the CaOV3 transfectants using Ki-67 staining.
In CaOV3-Six1 clones, 56 F 16% of the cells (average of two clones)
were positive for Ki-67, compared with 41 F 8% of the CaOV3-CAT
cells (average of two clones); this increase is statistically significant
(P = 0.04; Fig. 2B). Consistent with previous results in breast cancer
cells where Six1-dependent increases in proliferation are mediated
by cyclin A1 (23), we found that Six1 overexpression in OCC led to
an up-regulation of cyclin A1 (Fig. 2C).
Organs in Six1 knockout mice show decreased proliferation and
increased apoptosis (17–20), and high levels of Six1 overexpression
are observed in the TRAIL-resistant SKOV3 cells. Together, these
data suggest that the Six1 protein may confer both proliferative
and survival advantages. However, the role of Six1 in cancer cell
survival has not been established. Hoechst staining for nuclear
chromatin condensation revealed at least a 3-fold decrease in basal
apoptosis in Six1-overexpressing cells compared with CAT controls
(Fig. 3A; P = 0.02), suggesting that Six1 overexpression in OCC
increases net cell numbers by decreasing apoptosis in addition to
stimulating proliferation.
TRAIL resistance in cell lines overexpressing Six1. SKOV3
cells, which express significantly higher levels of Six1 mRNA and
protein than CaOV3 cells (Fig. 1), are reported to be more resistant
to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (38). We thus asked whether Six1
overexpression in CaOV3 and SNU251 cells, at levels similar to
endogenous expression in SKOV3 cells, could confer resistance to
TRAIL. As Fig. 3B shows, Six1 overexpression in CaOV3 cells
decreased TRAIL sensitivity from an IC50 of f3 ng/mL TRAIL in
CaOV3-CAT clones to an IC50 of f11 ng/mL TRAIL in CaOV3-Six1
clones. Similar results were obtained in SNU251 cells where the
IC50 was f7 ng/mL TRAIL in SNU251-CAT clones and f15 ng/mL
TRAIL in SNU251-Six1. In contrast, Six1 overexpression did not
confer resistance to the FasL (Supplementary Fig. S3).
To determine whether the high levels of Six1 in SKOV3 cells are
responsible for their resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, we
knocked down Six1 in SKOV3 cells using targeted siRNA. Two

pSUPER-based siRNA constructs targeting Six1 were transfected
into SKOV3 cells (Six1C and Six1F). In addition, a pSUPER
construct targeting luciferase (Luc), which engages the siRNA
machinery but does not affect Six1 levels, was transfected into
SKOV3 cells as control. When examined at the onset of the TRAIL
assay, Six1 protein was almost completely absent in SKOV3 cells
transfected with the pSUPER Six1C construct and was reduced

f50% (as determined by densitometric scanning of a Six1 Western
blot) in cells transfected with the pSUPER Six1F construct
(Fig. 4A). As expected, the pSUPER Luc siRNA had no effect on
Six1 levels (Fig. 4A). SKOV3 cells transfected with pSUPER Six1C, in
which Six1 was effectively knocked down, were dramatically
sensitized to TRAIL (IC50 f 15 ng/mL TRAIL) compared with
SKOV3 cells transfected with the pSUPER Luc control (IC50 not
reached at highest TRAIL concentration used, 1,000 ng/mL;
Fig. 4B). In addition, SKOV3 cells transfected with the Six1F
construct, in which Six1 was reduced f50%, were partially
sensitized to TRAIL (Fig. 4B). Because the extent of Six1
knockdown by each of the siRNAs correlated with the sensitivity
to TRAIL, these data, together with Six1 overexpression studies,
conclusively show that Six1 expression modulates sensitivity to
TRAIL. In contrast, complete Six1 knockdown in SKOV3 cells
(using Six1C) resulted in only a minimal (<2-fold) sensitization to
FasL (Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, Six1 selectively and
significantly inhibits TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
Six1 is overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas. Because TRAIL
resistance is potentially linked to the metastatic progression of
ovarian cancers, the discovery that Six1 modulates the response of
ovarian cancer cells to TRAIL could have significant implications
both for ovarian cancer prognosis as well as for therapeutic
interventions. For this reason, it is important to know whether Six1
overexpression is prevalent in ovarian carcinomas, and whether its
expression is related to cancer survival. To address these issues, we
isolated RNA from normal ovaries, cystadenomas, and early-stage
(stage I) and late-stage (stages II, III, and IV) ovarian carcinomas
and did quantitative RT-PCR to examine Six1 mRNA levels. It should
be noted that because normal ovary and cystadenoma samples may
contain a larger proportion of non-epithelial cells than either earlystage or late-stage tumors, an effort was made to selectively
separate and analyze the surface epithelium of normal ovaries and
cystadenomas as opposed to the underlying stroma at the time of
excision. Using a cutoff of 100 fg Six1/ng rRNA, 0 of 5 (0%) normal
postmenopausal ovaries, 4 of 13 (30%) cystadenomas, 3 of 6 (50%)
early-stage cancers (stage I), and 17 of 27 (63%) late-stage cancers
with loco-regional peritoneal dissemination (stages II–IV) were
shown to overexpress Six1 (Fig. 5A). Six1 mRNA is elevated in earlystage ovarian tumors compared with normal ovary (mean relative
expression, 117 F 34 fg/ng rRNA versus 32 F 16 fg/ng rRNA;

all alive with a median follow-up of 12 months, and 8 of 20 patients
are disease-free. Survival effects observed are independent of stage,
histology, extent of debulking, or chemosensitivity. Thus, high
levels of Six1 overexpression are significantly associated with poor
clinical outcome (P = 0.0015; Fig. 5B). As many, but not all,
late-stage ovarian carcinomas are of the serous subtype (see
Supplementary Table S1), we further restricted the Kaplan-Meier
analysis specifically to serous carcinomas to remove any differences in Six1 expression that may be due to tumor histology.
Supplementary Figure S5 shows that in serous ovarian carcinomas,
high levels of Six1 expression (>300 fg/ng 18S rRNA) also correlate
with significantly shortened survival (P = 0.015). This shows that
Six1 overexpression is significantly associated with worsened
survival within a histologic ovarian tumor subtype (serous) as
well as within all late-stage ovarian carcinomas regardless of
histologic subtype.

Discussion
In this study, we first show that Six1 overexpression in OCC leads
to increased proliferation that is associated with increased A-type

sequences against Six1 and luciferase (Luc) as outlined in the methods.

experiments done) and showed similar results, with the Six1C construct always
giving a near complete knockdown, and the Six1F construct resulting in
partial or no knockdown. B, effect of TRAIL on cells transfected with a control

P = 0.06) and is significantly elevated in late-stage tumors compared
with early-stage tumors (mean relative expression, 316 F 79 versus
117 F 34; P = 0.03) and in late-stage tumors compared with normal
ovary (P = 0.002). Because Six1 overexpression is significantly higher
in late-stage ovarian tumors compared with early-stage tumors
(both types composed primarily of epithelial cells), and because the
variability of Six1 expression occurs even within the late-stage
tumors, Six1 expression cannot be attributed merely to its presence
in an epithelial cell population. These data show that Six1 mRNA is
overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma and suggest that Six1
expression contributes to a more malignant phenotype.
To examine whether Six1 overexpression may contribute to a
more malignant phenotype, we determined the relationship
between levels of Six1 mRNA in patients with late-stage ovarian
cancer and survival. In support of a role for Six1 in tumor
progression, late-stage ovarian cancer patients expressing high
levels of Six1 (>300 fg/ng 18S rRNA) exhibited significantly
shortened survival at an overall median follow-up of 11 months
than late-stage ovarian cancer patients with lower levels of Six1
overexpression (see Supplementary Table S1 for a summary of
clinical-pathologic details of all ovarian tumors used in the KaplanMeier analysis). Of seven ovarian cancer patients with Six1 >300 fg/
ng rRNA, four have died with a median survival of 17 months; two
are alive with disease; and one is disease-free at 36 months of
follow-up. In contrast, the 20 ovarian cancer patients with latestage disease that exhibited Six1 levels below 300 fg/ng rRNA are

cyclin expression. These findings suggest that the mechanism by
which Six1 stimulates cell cycle progression is similar in ovarian
and breast cancer (23) as well as in rhabdomyosarcomas (34). Most
importantly, we further show that Six1 overexpression leads to
decreased apoptosis in OCC. Although many oncogenes that
increase proliferation concomitantly increase apoptosis (thus
requiring a second ‘‘hit’’ to inhibit apoptosis before tumors can
form; ref. 39), an oncogene that simultaneously increases proliferation and decreases apoptosis would be expected to have profound
effects in the cell, leading to rapid tumor growth.
We then show that Six1 specifically influences the TRAIL
apoptotic pathway. Six1 overexpression causes increased resistance to TRAIL, and knockdown of Six 1 in ovarian carcinoma cells
dramatically sensitizes cells to TRAIL, while having only a minimal
effect on FasL sensitization. A recent report suggested that Six1
expression leads to phosphorylation of Akt (34), a known survival
factor whose activity would be expected to result in some
protection against both TRAIL-mediated (40) and FasL-mediated
(41) apoptosis. This effect perhaps explains the minimal sensitization to FasL observed with Six1 knockdown. However, because
Six1 overexpression (which increases OCC proliferation) actually
decreases TRAIL but not FasL sensitivity, and because Six1 knockdown dramatically sensitizes SKOV3 cells to TRAIL (>60-fold with
complete Six1 knockdown), whereas an equivalent Six1 knockdown only sensitizes cells 2-fold to FasL, we suggest that Six1
plays a specific role in conferring resistance to TRAIL. Both TRAILand FasL-mediated apoptosis are extrinsic pathways of apoptosis
that use the same intracellular signaling pathways (6, 9). Therefore,
the greatly increased inhibition of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by
Six1 suggests that Six1 is specifically modulating events that
influence TRAIL receptor activation at the cell surface. The
mechanism by which Six1 confers resistance to TRAIL remains to
be determined.
The ability of Six1 to confer resistance to TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis in cancer cells has several important consequences.
Expression of TRAIL on natural killer cells has been shown to play
an important role in immunosurveillance against tumor cells and
is responsible for suppression of metastasis (42). TRAIL-deficient
mice are susceptible to both tumor initiation and metastasis,
further underscoring the role of TRAIL as a tumor suppressor (11).
Mutations of TRAIL receptors are associated with metastatic
breast cancer (14), and expression of TRAIL in breast and ovarian
cancers is associated with better prognosis (43, 44). Finally, TRAIL
therapies decrease metastases in a number of mouse models
(45, 46). Together, these data suggest that tumors expressing
molecules that confer resistance to TRAIL are likely to be more
biologically aggressive. Indeed, in this study, we have shown that
Six1 mRNA overexpression is associated with late-stage ovarian
carcinoma and more specifically confers a worse prognosis in late-

stage disease. It should be noted that most early-stage ovarian
carcinoma samples examined in this study were histologically
mucinous or endometrioid, whereas the majority of late-stage
ovarian carcinomas were histologically serous. Although it is
formally possible that the difference in Six1 expression correlates
with histologic subtype, this does not negate the finding that high
Six1 expression correlates with poor prognosis, as this is true even
within a specific histologic subtype (serous only; Supplementary
Fig. S5). Given the few late-stage mucinous or endometrioid
tumors, we are unable to definitively study the trivariate
relationship among Six1 expression, tumor stage, and histology.
Survival analysis done on late-stage ovarian carcinomas (stages
II–IV) showed that patients whose tumors had levels of Six1 >300
fg/ng rRNA had a shortened survival. Poor prognosis associated
with high levels of Six1 was independent of presenting CA125 level,
grade, histology, and extent of debulking. These observations
suggest that Six1 expression may be an important independent
prognostic indicator of poor survival for ovarian cancer patients.
In support of this concept, a recent study showed that Eya2, a Six1
coactivator, is amplified and up-regulated in ovarian cancer, and
its overexpression was significantly associated with shortened
survival in advanced disease (47). We conclude that the Six1-Eya
regulatory network, known to play an important role in the
development of numerous organs (17, 48, 49), may also play a role
in ovarian carcinoma.
A second important consequence of Six1 overexpression in
ovarian carcinoma is that it may alter tumor response to TRAILrelated therapies. Recombinant TRAIL and/or agonistic monoclonal antibodies are currently in phase I clinical trials against
advanced solid malignancies, including ovarian cancer (9). Because
Six1 mRNA is overexpressed in 63% of late-stage ovarian
carcinomas, and because TRAIL resistance is conferred by Six1
overexpression, it is highly likely that Six1 levels in patient tumors
will influence the outcome of these clinical trials. Hence, the status
of Six1 expression in ovarian tumors may serve not only as a
prognostic indicator of outcome but also as a functional screening
strategy to predict whether treatment targeting TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis may be of benefit.
