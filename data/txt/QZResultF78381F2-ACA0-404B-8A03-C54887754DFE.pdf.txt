Abstract
Statins purportedly exert anti-tumoral effects on breast cancer. However, the
biologic mechanisms for these actions are not fully elucidated. The aims of this study
were 1) to explore the effects of simvastatin on apoptosis, proliferation as well as
PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathway in a window-of-opportunity breast cancer
trial; 2) to further confirm findings from the clinical trial by functional studies; 3)
to explore the regulatory role of mevalonate pathway on the anti-tumoral effects of
simvastatin. In clinical samples, simvastatin led to increase in cleaved caspase-3 (p
= 0.002) and decreased trend for Ki67 (p = 0.245). Simvastatin markedly suppressed
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling by activating PTEN (p = 0.005) and by dephosphorylating
Akt (p = 0.002) and S6RP (p = 0.033); it also inhibited MAPK/ERK pathway by
dephosphorylating c-Raf (p = 0.018) and ERK1/2 (p = 0.002). In ER-positive (MCF7, T47D) and ER-negative (MDA-MB-231, BT-549) breast cancer cells, simvastatin
treatment consistently induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation by deregulating
caspase cascades and cell cycle proteins in a dose dependent manner. Concordantly,
simvastatin strongly suppressed PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by enhancing PTEN
expression and by further sequentially dephosphorylating downstream cascades
including Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, S6RP and 4E-BP1. Furthermore, simvastatin significantly
inhibited MAPK/ERK pathway by dephosphorylating sequential cascades such as
c-Raf, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. These simvastatin anti-tumoral effects were reversed
by metabolic products of the mevalonate pathway, including mevalonate, farnesyl
pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. These findings shed light on the
biological and potential anti-tumoral effects of simvastatin in breast cancer.

Introduction

epidemiological study in a Danish cohort showed a 15%
reduction in all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in
statins users as compared to non-users [4]. Preclinical
studies have shown that statins play an important role
in suppressing proliferation, inducing apoptosis and
inhibiting metastasis of breast cancer [3, 5, 6]. In windowof-opportunity clinical trials in breast cancer, short term
statins treatment exerted anti-tumoral effects by inhibiting
proliferation and promoting apoptosis [7-9]. One study

Commonly used as cholesterol-lowering drugs,
statins are small-molecule inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase
of the mevalonate pathway, also known as cholesterol
biosynthesis pathway. Recently, statins have attracted
attention as potential therapeutic agents in various types
of cancer, including colon, lung and breast [1-3]. An

suggested the anti-proliferation effects of statins to be
more significant in HMG-CoA reductase positive breast
cancer [10].
As mevalonate pathway inhibitors, the potential
mechanisms of anti-tumoral effects of statins are complex,
including both cholesterol-dependent and -independent
effects. Cholesterol-dependent effects include the
deprivation of tumor cells from their increased demand of
cholesterol uptake [11, 12]. On the other hand, cholesterolindependent pleiotropic effects exerted by statins may
also contribute to their anti-tumoral effects [3, 13].
By suppressing HMG-CoA reductase, statins decrease
levels of mevalonate and downstream lipid isoprenoid
intermediates, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)
and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) [14]. These
isoprenoid intermediates provide lipid attachments for
intracellular G-proteins, including Ras and Rho, which
must undergo post-translational prenylation by FFP or
GGPP to enable their translocation from cytoplasm to
cell membrane [14]. Through inhibition of prenylation
of Ras and Rho proteins, statins may suppress extensive
downstream signalling pathways of these proteins, such as
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways, which
are commonly abrogated in many types of cancer. A recent
global gene expression study has reported atorvastatin
to inhibit the MAPK pathway in breast cancer biopsies
[8]. However, the precise mechanisms by which statins
suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis of breast
cancer are still not fully understood. The biological
alterations following statins treatment in prospective
clinical trials, particularly their potential effects on PI3K/
Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways, are lacking.
In this study, immunohistochemistry (IHC)
staining on breast cancer clinical samples treated with
simvastatin prospectively and in vitro functional studies
on breast cancer cell lines were applied with the following
objectives: 1) to explore the effects of simvastatin on
apoptosis, proliferation and Ras downstream pathways
including PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK in a
window-of-opportunity breast cancer trial; 2) to further
confirm findings from the clinical trial with functional
studies using breast cancer cell lines; and 3) to explore the
regulatory role of mevalonate pathway on the anti-tumoral
effects of simvastatin. These findings shed light on the
biological and potential therapeutic effects of simvastatin
in breast cancer.

Simvastatin induced apoptosis and suppressed
proliferation of breast cancer in clinical specimens
(Figure 1A)
15 female patients with newly diagnosed primary
breast cancer received 5-38 days of simvastatin at a dose
of 20 mg daily before definitive breast cancer surgery.
Pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies were obtained
before starting simvastatin and at surgery, respectively.
Significant induction of apoptosis as determined by
positive cleaved caspase-3 was seen in post-treatment
tumors (8.9±7.4 vs 23.4±24.3, p = 0.002). Decreased
trend in Ki67 was observed in post-treatment in relation
to pre-treatment samples, although p-value did not reach
significance (74.6±59.9 vs 57.7±35.2, p = 0.245).

Simvastatin deactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR and
MAPK/ERK pathways of breast cancer in clinical
specimens (Figure 1B and 1C)
Simvastatin significantly inhibited PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signalling pathway by increasing PTEN expression
(30.0±46.6 vs 66.1±65.2, p = 0.005) and decreasing
phosphorylation of both Akt at Ser473 and S6RP at
Ser235/236 (93.0±87.4 vs 9.0±19.5, p = 0.002 for p-Akt;
108.6±67.7 vs 63.7±51.6, p = 0.033 for p-S6RP; Figure
1B). Similarly, simvastatin also deactivated MAPK/ERK
pathway by dephosphorylating c-Raf at Tyr340/341 and
ERK1/2 at Thr202/Thy204 (107.3±67.1 vs 57.3±51.8,
p = 0.018 for p-c-Raf and 105.0±73.1 vs 26.6±42.6, p =
0.002 for p-ERK1/2; Figure 1C). These data indicate that
simvastatin dually deactivates both PI3K/Akt/mTOR and
MAPK/ERK signalling pathways in breast cancer.

Simvastatin-induced apoptosis and suppression
of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway were early events
while deactivation of MAPK/ERK pathway was a
late event in clinical specimens (Figure 1D)
To further determine time-related responses upon
exposure to simvastatin, patients were divided into two
subgroups using mean treatment duration of 14 days
as cut-off: ≤14 day group (mean 9.4±3.7, range 5 to 14
days, n = 9); >14 day group (mean 21.5±9.0, range 15
to 38 days, n = 6). As shown in Figure 1D, in tumors
exposed to simvastatin ≤14 days, simvastatin significantly
increased apoptosis by enhancing cleaved caspase-3
expression (10.5±8.9 vs 18.5±16.6, p = 0.039) and
deactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by enhancing
PTEN expression (16.3±27.7 vs 36.9±41.8, p = 0.030) and
by dephosphorylating both Akt and S6RP (106.7±82.5 vs

12.8±24.1 for p-Akt, p = 0.006; 132.5±46.5 vs 56.3±39.6
for p-S6RP, p = 0.003). However, no significant changes
in the MAPK/ERK pathway were observed following
short exposure to simvastatin ≤14 days (p = 0.237
for p-c-Raf; p = 0.069 for p-ERK1/2). As for tumors
exposed to simvastatin >14 days, deactivation of Akt
pathway continued to be observed with enhanced PTEN
expression (48.3±62.1 vs 105.0 ±73.7, p = 0.012).
Interestingly, deactivation of MAPK/ERK pathway was
now obvious through dephosphorylation of both c-Raf
and ERK1/2 (113.2±52.0 vs 40.0±39.0, p = 0.023 for p-cRaf; 118.3±82.3 vs 28.0±33.5, p = 0.011 for p-ERK1/2)
with longer exposure to simvastatin. These data suggest
that simvastatin treatment with mean duration 9.4 days
is sufficient to deactivate PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and
induce cancer cell apoptosis, while longer exposure with
mean duration 21.5 days is required for deactivation of
MAPK/ERK pathway in human breast cancer cells in vivo.

Since we have observed the cytotoxic effects
of simvastatin on breast cancer in clinical specimens,
we then went on to explore its anti-cancer effects in
ER-positive (MCF-7, T47D) and ER-negative (MDAMB-231, BT-549) breast cancer cell lines. Simvastatin
increased the activities of caspase-3/7 in a dose dependent
manner following 48 hours treatment. 50µM simvastatin
induced caspase-3/7 by 6-fold in BT-549, 3-fold in MDAMB-231 and 2-fold in both MCF-7 and T47D (Figure 2A).
MCF-7 cells are deficient in the expression of caspase-3
because of a spontaneous deletion within the CASP-3
gene [15], leading to proteolysis impairment of a range
of caspase substrates in MCF-7 cells, including PARP
[16]. Therefore, we focused on T47D, MDA-MB-231 and
BT-549 cells for further validation on apoptosis. Using
Western blot analysis, we confirmed significant cleavage
of caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP in cells treated for
48 hours, and obvious dose-dependent cleavages were

Simvastatin inhibited proliferation of breast
cancer cell lines (Figure 2C and 2D)

seen at dosages as low as 0.4µM for MDA-MB-231 and
5µM for BT-549. As for T47D cells, significant cleavage
of caspase-3 but not caspase-8 and PARP was found at
dosage as low as 10µM following 48 hours treatment
(Figure 2B), suggesting simvastatin-induced apoptosis
was more caspase-3 dependent in a subpopulation of
breast cancer cells. Collectively, apoptotic data suggest
that simvastatin induces apoptosis through both enhancing
the activities of caspase-3/7 and promoting the cleavage
of caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP in some breast cancer
cells; caspase-3 appears to be a major caspase involved
in simvastatin induced apoptosis. Previous reports also
showed that lovastatin induced apoptosis by increasing
activities of caspase cascades in other cancers [17, 18].
Therefore, caspases are identified as potential mediators
of statins-induced apoptosis.

Similarly, we attempted to confirm the clinical
observations of inhibitory effects of simvastatin on breast
cancer growth by functional studies. MTS assay showed
that simvastatin inhibited the growth of MCF-7, T47D,
MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 in a dose dependent manner.
Among these 4 cell lines, MDA-MB-231 appears to be
the most sensitive, with significant inhibition of cell
growth seen in cells treated at dosage as low as 0.5µM
of simvastatin (Figure 2C). Western blot analysis further
confirmed that simvastatin decreased the expression
of c-myc and cyclin D1 and increased p21 and p27 in a
dose dependent manner. Significant changes for these cell
cycle biomarkers were seen at dosages as low as 10µM
for both MCF-7 and T47D, 0.4 µM for MDA-MB-231
and 2.5µM for BT-549 (Figure 2D). Taken together,
our findings suggest that simvastatin suppresses the

expression of cell cycle-promoting proteins and increases
cell cycle-suppressing proteins and thus inhibits cell cycle
progression from G1 to S phase to suppress breast cancer
cell proliferation.

simvastatin suppresses PI3K pathway of breast cancer
through enhancing PTEN expression. Furthermore, in all 4
cell lines, dose-dependent suppression of phosphorylation
was noted for Akt at Ser473, mTOR at Ser 2488 and
p70S6K at Thr389. These suggest that simvastatin is able
to mediate other alternative effectors to inhibit Akt/mTOR
signalling in PTEN-null tumors. Therefore, simvastatin
treatment blocked PI3K downstream signalling through
dephosphorylating Akt, mTOR and p70S6K. Moreover,
we examined the effects of simvastatin on phosphorylation
of S6 ribosomal protein, a direct target for p70S6K, whose
phosphorylation promotes the translation of mRNA that
has oligopyrimidine tracts in the 5’ untranslated region.
Simvastatin treatment strongly suppressed phosphorylation
of S6 ribosomal protein. We also examined the effects
of simvastatin treatment on phosphorylation of the
translational repressor 4E-BP1, a protein that plays a key
regulatory role on the inhibition of cap-dependent mRNA
translation by negatively controlling the function of elF4E.
Simvastatin treatment of cells significantly suppressed
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr37/36. Thus, simvastatin
appears to negatively regulate activation of PI3K/Akt and
further block mTOR→S6 ribosomal protein and →4EBP1 signalling cascades in breast cancer cells.

pathway in breast cancer cell lines (Figure 3A)
There is emerging evidence that constitutive
activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a critical
role in the survival and growth of breast cancer cells.
Here, we explored the effects of simvastatin on PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway effectors, including PTEN, Akt, mTOR,
p70S6K, S6RP and 4E-BP1. After 48 hours treatment,
PTEN expression increased in MCF-7, T47D and MDAMB-231 cells at dosages as low as 10µM for both
MCF-7 and T47D and 0.2µM for MDA-MB-231 cells,
respectively. PTEN expression is undetectable in BT-549
because it is a PTEN-null cell line [19]. It has been wellknown that tumor suppressor PTEN dephosphorylates
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
(PIP3)
to
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), thereby
terminating PI3K-dependent signalling. Our findings
suggest that, in PTEN-intact breast cancer cell lines,

would be inhibited by simvastatin, phosphorylation
levels of MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and p90RSK were assessed
by immunoblotting. Consistently, dephosphorylation of
downstream effectors of c-Raf, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and
p90RSK, was seen in MCF-7, T47D and BT-549 treated
with equal to or more than 10µM simvastatin for MCF7 and T47D as well as 2.5µM for BT-549, suggesting
simvastatin sequentially deactivates MAPK/ERK pathway
in these cell lines. Surprisingly, simvastatin did not show
similar effects on these c-Raf downstream effectors in
MBA-MD-231. MDA-MB-231 harbours BRAF (G464V)
mutation, which leads to constitutive activation of MAPK
pathway, and this may have resulted in relative resistance
to inhibition of this pathway by simvastatin. Previous
reports on other cancers also confirmed the disruption of
ERK1/2 phosphorylation by statins (32, 33). These data

To determine the effects of simvastatin on MAPK/
ERK pathway, phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser338,
MEK1/2 at Ser217/221, ERK1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204
and p90RSK at Ser380 was assessed by Western blot
analysis. 10 and 20µM simvastatin were required to
dephosphorylate c-Raf in MCF-7 and T47D respectively,
while a much lower concentration of 0.2 and 2.5µM
simvastatin started to suppress c-Raf phosphorylation
in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549, respectively. In addition,
dose-dependent suppression of c-Raf expression was seen
in both MDA-MB-231 and BT-549. These data suggest
that c-Raf is simvastatin-sensitive in breast cancer cells.
To further examine if downstream effectors of c-Raf

(Figure 4L) cells; the reversal effects on phospho-Akt
were incomplete compared to its relatively full recovery
on phospho-ERK1/2. Our findings indicate that both
protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation play an
important role in inhibiting PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK
pathway by simvastatin in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and
BT-549. However, in T47D cells (Figure 4J), the protective
effects of mevalonate and GGPP on Akt and ERK1/2
phosphorylation were again more obvious than that of
FPP, suggesting that deactivation of these two signalling
pathways by simvastatin may be mainly regulated by
inhibiting protein geranylgeranylation in T47D cells.
Taken together, depletion of mevalonate, FPP and
GGPP by simvastatin contributes to simvastatin-induced
apoptosis, proliferation inhibition and deactivation of
PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways in breast cancer cell
lines.

suggest that MAPK/ERK is another target pathway of
simvastatin in cancer, which can explain, at least partially,
the apoptosis induction and anti-proliferation effects of
statins.

Mevalonate pathway contributed to simvastatin
induced apoptosis, proliferation inhibition and
deactivation of PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK
pathways in breast cancer cells (Figure 4)
To further determine whether the anti-cancer
effects of simvastatin is mediated by the blocking of
mevalonate pathway, we performed add-back experiments
using mevalonate, FPP or GGPP, intermediates of the
mevalonate pathway. MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231
and BT-549 cells were pre-treated with mevalonate,
FPP or GGPP, followed by simvastatin treatment for 48
hours. Mevalonate, FPP and GGPP could reverse the
levels of caspase-3/7 close to that in vehicle controls for
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (P < 0.05 for
mevalonate, FPP and GGPP versus simvastatin treatment
respectively, Figure 4A, 4C-4D). However, in T47D
cells, FPP only partially rescued the levels of caspase-3/7
compared to relatively full recovery with mevalonate
and GGPP (Figure 4B). Similarly, MTS assay showed
that mevalonate, FPP and GGPP were able to reverse the
anti-cancer effects induced by simvastatin (P < 0.05 for
mevalonate, FPP and GGPP versus simvastatin treatment
respectively, Figure 4E-4H) in all 4 cell lines, although
the rescue was again less complete with FFP for T47D
cells. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed that
simvastatin-induced dephosphorylation of Akt at Ser473
and ERK1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204 was markedly blocked

Discussion
Observational studies and meta-analyses have
demonstrated that statins exposure could cause reduction
in risk of multiple cancers, including breast cancer
[4, 20-22]. Preclinical reports have also shown that
statins play important roles in inducing apoptosis and
suppressing proliferation of breast cancer [3, 5, 6]. In
this study, clinical samples treated prospectively together
with in vitro functional studies concordantly show
simvastatin to induce apoptosis, suppress proliferation
and dephosphorylate sequential signalling cascades of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways of breast
cancer. These simvastatin-induced anti-tumoral effects are

regulated by suppression of mevalonate pathway. To our
best knowledge, the current study is the first prospective
clinical report, which shows simvastatin-induced breast
cancer death and suppression of both PI3K/Akt/mTOR
and MAPK/ERK pathways.
Previous studies have drawn our attention to the
relatively higher sensitivity to statins of ER-negative
breast cancer cells [23-25]. Although our data from
clinical specimens were not able to show the differential
response to simvastatin between ER-positive and ERnegative tumors probably due to the relatively small
sample size of this clinical study (n = 3 for ER-negative
patients), functional studies concordantly showed ERnegative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549)
to be more sensitive than ER-positive cells (MCF-7 and
T47D) to simvastatin treatment. Significant biological
effects were found at relatively lower simvastatin doses
for ER-negative breast cancer cells than ER-positive
ones. A previous study showed estrogen protected ERpositive breast cancer from the anti-proliferative effects
of statins [26], and this may in part explain the differential
sensitivity to statins between ER-negative and ER-positive
breast cancers. The exact mechanisms which confer
relative resistance of ER-positive breast cancer to statins
warrant further study.
The presence of concurrent multiple activated
signalling pathways contributes to the heterogeneous
nature of breast cancer and thus necessitates multitargeted approaches for effective breast cancer prevention
and therapy. In breast cancer, constitutive activation of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK signal pathways is
an important event, which regulates multiple cellular
processes to promote cancer cell growth, survival, and
metastasis [27, 28]. An emerging concept is targeting
two or more different signal transduction pathways as
a therapeutic strategy, for example, PI3K/Akt/mTOR
and MAPK/ERK [29]. This has been explored in some
preclinical models as well as clinical trials. Previous
preclinical studies showed that dual inhibition of PI3K/
Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways by combining
two different small molecule kinase inhibitors led to more
efficient growth inhibition than single pathway inhibition
in both breast and lung cancers [26, 30]. Strikingly,
a recent phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced
cancers confirmed that dual blockade of both PI3K/
AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways resulted in more
favourable efficacy compared to single blockade of either
pathway [31]. This is probably due to the interconnection
between PI3K and MAPK pathway with multiple points
of convergence, cross-talk, and feedback loops. For
example, ERK1/2 converges on mTORC1 via P90RSK,
leading to nuclear transcriptional changes that regulate
cell proliferation and survival [32]. Signalling can remain
active by alternative pathways despite inhibition of one
pathway, making concurrent inhibition of both PI3K and
MAPK pathway a rational therapeutic approach. However,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dual blockade of both PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK
pathways by combining small molecule kinase inhibitors
were usually achieved at the expense of higher toxicity and
financial cost [31]. Developing a safe therapeutic agent
that has multiple targets is thus an attractive alternative.
In this study, we found simvastatin to induce apoptosis,
inhibit proliferation of breast cancer and deactivate
sequential cascades of both PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/
ERK pathways. Our data on MAPK pathway inhibition
by simvastatin is consistent with a recent gene expression
study on clinical specimens of breast cancer treated with
statins [8]. Simvastatin is cheap, safe, and well-tolerated,
with a long track record of clinical use in the treatment
of hypercholesterolemia. Thus, simvastatin has the
potential to be used as a multi-targeted agent to inhibit
both PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK signalling and
consequently suppress tumour growth. Moreover, aberrant
activation of both PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK
signalling pathways has been associated with resistance
to conventional therapy in breast cancer, including both
chemotherapy and endocrine therapy [33-35]. Therefore,
the combination of statins and chemotherapy or endocrine
therapy is a promising strategy to overcome resistance
to conventional therapy in breast cancer, which warrants
further investigation.
Interestingly, in clinical specimens, we found early
effects on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling and relatively
later effects on MAPK/ERK signalling in response to
simvastatin (mean duration exposure 9.4 vs 21.5 days).
Although data on the differential responses between
PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK signalling following
statins treatment in cancer are very limited, sensitivity to
inhibitors of these two signalling pathways has been linked
to genetic mutations in key element in these pathways,
such as PIK3CA, PTEN, Akt and Raf [36, 37]. In breast
cancer, mutations in individual components in the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway are more frequent than in the MAPK/
ERK pathway [38], and this may be one reason why
earlier effects were seen in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
relative to the MAPK/ERK pathway. We acknowledge
that our observation of differential time-based response of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK is on a relatively small
number of patients (n = 15), and tumor biopsies collected
at early and late time-points were not obtained from the
same patients; further prospective study with collection
of serial tumor biopsies (e.g., pretreatment, 9-days and
21-days post-treatment) from the same patients of a largesized cohort is warranted to further confirm the current
findings.
Mevalonate pathway, also defined as cholesterol
synthesis pathway, plays an important role in breast
carcinogenesis, growth and metastasis. Exogenous
expression of HMG-CoA reductase deregulated the
mevalonate pathway and facilitated transformation in
human breast cancer cell lines [39]. 27HC, a primary
metabolite of cholesterol, promoted tumor growth and
2539

Oncotarget

metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer [40]. Thus,
blocking mevalonate pathway may be a useful strategy
for breast cancer prevention or treatment. Through
inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase in the mevalonate
pathway, simvastatin suppresses the generation of
mevalonate, FPP and GGPP and further deregulates
both cholesterol biosynthesis and protein prenylation
[14]. In cancer treatment, statins are believed to serve
as prenylation inhibitors of Ras GTPase, which may
suppress extensive Ras downstream signalling pathways,
such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK [14, 41].
Consistent with previous findings in lymphoma [42]
and colorectal cancer [43], we showed that individual
add-back with mevalonate, FPP and GGPP was able to
reverse simvastatin-induced apoptosis, proliferation
inhibition and deactivation of PI3K/Akt and MAPK/
ERK signalling in breast cancer cell lines. Strikingly,
we found that mevalonate, FPP and GGPP were able to
rescue the dephosphorylation of both Akt and ERK1/2
by simvastatin in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549,
whereas only mevalonate and GGPP but not FPP reversed
the deactivation of Akt and ERK1/2 in T47D (Figure 4J).
Our findings indicate that depletion of farnesylated- and
geranylgeranylated-protein by simvastatin deactivates
PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathway in MCF-7, MDAMB-231 and BT-549. However, in T47D cells, suppression
of PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK may be more dependent on
inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation by simvastatin.
The crucial prenylated proteins inhibited by simvastatin
in breast cancer are still unknown. Further studies to
identify the specific prenylated proteins that are modified
by simvastatin will help to design improved simvastatinbased therapeutic strategies. Moreover, we found the
reversal effects on phospho-Akt at Ser473 by adding
metabolic products to be incomplete compared to the
relatively full recovery on phospho-ERK1/2 at Thr202/
Tyr204 in MCF-7 (Figure 4I), MDA-MB-231 (Figure
4K) and BT-549 (Figure 4L) cells. This indicates that
simvastatin may additionally suppress PI3K/Akt pathway
through mevalonate-independent mechanisms. Recently,
accumulating evidence suggests that cholesterol plays an
important role in cancer progression and development
through activating survival signalling of Akt [44-46].
Further exploration on the effects of simvastatin on the
levels of intracellular cholesterol in breast cancer may help
to explain these current findings.
Simvastatin is not the most potent statin in terms of
reducing the levels of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol.
Dose-for-dose, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin are more
effective than simvastatin [47]. Despite this, simvastatin
is observed to exert systemic anti-tumoral effects in our
window-of-opportunity clinical trial. To date, simvastatin
has shown the most data on potential anti-cancer effect
in both pre-clinical and clinical studies, in part because
it is one of the most widely prescribed statins [48-52].
Simvastatin certainly warrants exploration as a therapeutic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

agent in breast cancer. To further exploit statins in cancer
therapeutics, it will also be worthy to study other more
potent statins, such as rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, in
breast cancer therapeutics.
In this study, breast cancer clinical samples treated
prospectively, together with in vitro functional studies,
concordantly show simvastatin to induce apoptosis,
inhibit proliferation and suppress PI3K/Akt/mTOR and
MAPK/ERK pathways in breast cancer, and these antitumoral effects are achieved by inhibiting the mevalonate
pathway. Our findings provide the basis for future
clinical trials design. Prospective trials which incorporate
simvastatin together with conventional treatments, such as
chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, will be interesting
to directly address if incorporating statins in anti-cancer
therapy can indeed improve treatment efficacy in breast
cancer patients.

Patients, Materials and Methods
Patients
A prospective window-of-opportunity trial was
conducted at the National University Cancer Institute,
Singapore; 15 female patients with newly diagnosed
primary breast cancer received 5-38 days of simvastatin
at a dose of 20 mg daily before definitive breast cancer
surgery. Pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies were
obtained before starting simvastatin and at surgery,
respectively. The clinicopathological characteristics of
the patient cohort were summarized in Table 1. This study
was approved by the institutional ethics review board and
written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

IHC staining
As described previously [53-55], consecutive
sections of 4µm thickness were cut from pre- and posttreatment tumor samples. Slides were stained with
a BondMax Autostainer (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Antibodies used for IHC staining were listed in
Supplementary Table 1.

Scoring of IHC expression
The expression of cleaved caspase-3, PTEN,
p-Akt, p-S6RP, p-c-Raf and p-ERK1/2 in tumor cells was
scored by H-score [53, 54]. Briefly, immunoreactivity of
biomarkers was scored by multiplying the intensity and
extent of staining from the same specimen according to
the following formula:
IHC score = staining intensity × staining extent
2540

Oncotarget

IHC score range was from 0 to 300. Staining
intensity was classified into four groups: 0 (negative), 1
(weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong). Staining extent was
defined as the approximate percentage of positive staining
cells in the total cancer compartment. Ki67 proliferation
index was assessed by calculating Ki67 positive tumor
nuclei in 500 tumor cells [10].

5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium, inner salt; MTS] (Promega, Madison, WI)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer and the
absorbance at 490nm was determined using a 96-well
plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).

Western blot analysis

Cell lines and reagents

After treatment with simvastatin at the indicated
concentrations, cell pellets were collected and lysed.
Proteins were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), incubated
with different primary antibodies and detected by
enhanced chemiluminescent immunodetection system (GE
Healthcare Life Science, Little Chalfont, UK).

Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (ER+),
T47D (ER+), MDA-MB-231 (ER-) and BT-549 (ER-)
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were maintained
in high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) or RPMI 1460 media (T47D
and BT-549) (Nacalai Tesque, Japan), supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cell lines were re-authenticated
upon receipt. Simvastatin, mevalonate, ammonium salt
of FPP and GGPP were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Co (St. Louis, MO, USA). Simvastatin was dissolved in
DMSO which was used as vehicle control. Antibodies used
for Western blot analysis were listed in Supplementary
Table 1.

Statistical analysis
The different immunoreactivity expression of
biomarkers between pre- and post-treatment tumors was
analyzed using paired t-test. The anti-tumoral effects of
simvastatin on breast cancer cells compared with vehicle
controls, as well as the protective effects of mevalonate,
FPP and GGPP on breast cancer cells, were determined
with t-tests. Statistical analyses were performed using
IBM SPSS package (version 19.0 for Windows, IBM
SPSS Inc., USA) with significance at 5%.

Cell treatment
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates or 10cm dishes
and treated with simvastatin at the indicated concentrations
for 24 or 48 hours. To determine if metabolic products
of the mevalonate pathway could block the anti-tumoral
effects of simvastatin, cells were pre-treated with 200µM
mevalonate, 10µM FPP and 20µM GGPP respectively
for 1 hour and then incubated with or without simvastatin
for 48 hours, at dosage showing significant anti-tumoral
effects on breast cancer cells (20µM for MCF-7 and
T47D; 0.8µM for MDA-231; 10µM for BT-549). All the
experiments were performed in three independent assays.
