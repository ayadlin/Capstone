ABSTRACT
Transcriptional repression of E-cadherin is a hallmark of Epithelial-toMesenchymal Transition (EMT) and is associated with cancer cell invasion and
metastasis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying E-cadherin repression during
EMT may provide insights into the development of novel targeted therapeutics for
cancer. Here, we report on the chemical probe, ML327, which de-represses E-cadherin
transcription, partially reverses EMT, and inhibits cancer cell invasiveness and
tumor cell migration in vitro and in vivo. Induction of E-cadherin mRNA expression
by ML327 treatment does not require de novo protein synthesis. RNA sequencing
analysis revealed that ML327 treatment significantly alters expression of over 2,500
genes within three hours in the presence of the translational inhibitor, cycloheximide.
Network analysis reveals Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4-alpha (HNF4α) as the most
significant upstream transcriptional regulator of multiple genes whose expressions
were altered by ML327 treatment. Further, small interfering RNA-mediated depletion
of HNF4α markedly attenuates the E-cadherin expression response to ML327. In
summary, ML327 represents a valuable tool to understand mechanisms of EMT and
may provide the basis for a novel targeted therapeutic strategy for carcinomas.

INTRODUCTION

primary tumor mass and invade into surrounding stromal
tissues. Epithelial-cadherin (E-cadherin, encoded by the
CDH1 gene) is a key component of the adherens junction
complex and plays a pivotal role in epithelial tissue
architecture and cell differentiation. Since most solid
tumors are carcinomas that are derived from epithelial
cells/tissues that predominantly express E-cadherin,
the capacity of these cells to undergo neoplastic
transformation and to metastasize is often associated with

Cancer is a leading cause of death in the United
States, and the vast majority of these cancers are of
epithelial cell origin, or carcinomas [1]. Over 90% of
cancer deaths related to solid malignancies are due to
metastatic dissemination of cancer to secondary organs
[2]. A hallmark of tumor malignancy and a requirement for
metastasis is the acquired ability of cells to detach from the

the loss of expression of this protein[3, 4].
Loss of E-cadherin expression can be due to
mutational inactivation of the CDH1 gene (as in familial
gastric cancer syndrome) [5, 6], but more frequently the
loss of expression is due to transcriptional inhibition or
epigenetic silencing. EMT is a developmentally regulated
process whereby epithelial cells undergo coordinated
reprogramming of their gene expression and lose the
epithelial characteristics of tight cell-cell adhesiveness
and apical-basal polarity while gaining mesenchymal
properties that include increased motility and capacity for
invasion through the basement membrane[7, 8]. Several
developmentally important transcriptional regulatory
proteins, such as ZEB1, ZEB2, Snai1, Snai2/SLUG,
TWIST 1, and E47/TCF3, induce EMT and are directly
involved in repression of E-cadherin expression [9].
Because of the strong association of decreased
E-cadherin expression and EMT, we undertook a
phenotypic small molecule screen to identify compounds
that could elevate E-cadherin in an E-cadherin-low, and
metastatic, colon cancer cell line as we have previously
reported [10]. A focused medicinal chemistry optimization
effort generated over three hundred analogs of the parent
phenotypic screening hit that increased E-cadherin
expression. Secondary and tertiary screening assays
demonstrated that the optimized compound, herein
referred to as ML327, de-represses E-cadherin expression
in human SW620inv colon and H520 lung cancer cells
and inhibits cell invasion in culture with little to no
cytotoxicity at effective concentrations. Importantly,
ML327 reverses TGF-β induced EMT in cell culture
and inhibits cancer cell motility in vivo. Furthermore,
we find that ML327 alters expression of numerous genes
in addition to CDH1, and functional gene enrichment
analysis shows that HNF4α is significantly implicated
as the upstream regulator for numerous differentially
expressed genes. Thus, we have developed ML327 from
a phenotypic screen, and determined multiple mechanistic
features of its activity. We conclude that ML327 provides
a new direction for probing the biological process of EMT
and may yield therapeutic benefit by disrupting carcinoma
progression through a unique mechanism of action.

enable mechanistic studies. Additional optimization
resulted in a new sub-series of compounds with
improved potency and efficacy as well as more suitable
physicochemical properties. The new analog sub-series is
exemplified by N-(3-(2-hydroxynicotinamido) propyl)-5phenylisoxazole-3-carboxamide, which we have named
ML327, a Molecular Libraries Probe Center Network
(MLPCN) probe (Figure 1A). The medicinal chemistry
effort also uncovered structurally related molecules
with minimal E-cadherin de-repression activity, such as
the phenylpyrrole 266Y, (2-(5-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-3carboxamido) ethyl) isonicotinamide trifluoroacetate),
which serves as a negative control besides vehicle DMSO
in our experiments described below.
To increase the signal to noise ratio in our
experiments, we utilized SW620 colon cancer cells
(herein referred to as “SW620inv”) that were selected for
high invasive potential and low E-cadherin expression
by passage through Matrigel, and all the selected clones
shown E-cadherin restoration by Trichostatin A (TSA), a
known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, as parental
SW620 (Supplementary Figure 1). Next, a quantitative
in-cell Western (ICW) assay was used to determine an
EC50 value of 2.22 μM +/- 0.25 for ML327 activity in
SW620inv cells (Figure 1A- 1B), a 2-5 fold improvement
over the first generation tool [10].
Since cell surface E-cadherin expression is
associated with intact epithelial junctions and epithelial
homeostasis, we examined the effect of ML327 on cell
viability and cell invasive potential. To assess the effect
of ML327 on cell viability, SW620inv and H520 cells
were grown in the presence of 10μM ML327, 10μM
266Y or DMSO for up to four days and DNA content was
measured at 24 hour intervals. We found no differences
in the DNA content of these treatment groups, indicating
that ML327 has no measurable effect on cell viability
in either the SW620inv or H520 cells in 2D culture
conditions (Figure 1C). To assess the effect of ML327 on
cell invasion, SW620inv and H520 cells were grown in
the presence of 10μM ML327, 10μM 266Y or DMSO for
48 hours, allowing for invasion through Matrigel covered
chambers. We found that ML327 reduced SW620inv cell
invasion through Matrigel by ~60% and reduced H520 cell
invasion by ~30% in these in vitro assays (Figure 1D).
These experiments demonstrated that ML327 significantly
inhibits invasion of these cell lines with no effect on cell
viability.

ML327 partially reverses TGF-β-induced EMT

Our previous studies identified novel pharmacology
for a series of isoxazole-based compounds in restoring
E-cadherin protein to the surface of selected aggressive
colon and lung cancer cells and inhibiting cancer
cell invasion[10]. However, this first generation of
compounds lacked the physiochemical properties to

To examine the effect of ML327 on EMT, we
studied its activity in the classical model system of TGF-β
induced EMT in NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial
gland cells. TGF-β induced morphological changes in
NMuMG cells consistent with EMT [11, 12], (Figure 2A).

by TGF-β in NMuMG cells, we treated cells with or
without TGF-β1 for 72 hours and then allowed the cells to
continue to grow under the same TGF-β1 (+/-) treatment
conditions in the presence or absence of ML327 for
additional 48 hours. As a result of EMT, the cells adopt a
spindlelike shape, and appeared to increase in size (Figure
2B), which is also consistent with a previous report [13].
We found that ML327 partially restored E-cadherin
expression at the plasma membrane in NMuMG cells
induced to undergo EMT by TGF-β1 treatment (Figure
2B). We also found that treatment with ML327 increased
expression of both E-cadherin (CDH1) and Occludin (tight

junction protein) mRNA levels and decreased expression
of Vimentin mRNA in NMuMG TGF-β1 treated cells,
relative to cells treated with DMSO or 266Y (Figure
2C). These results are consistent with the conclusion that
ML327 reverses typical molecular features of EMT in this
experimental system.

membrane (CAM) assay. HEp3 (human epidermoid
carcinoma) cells were selected as an E-cadherinlow GFP-labeled carcinoma cell line that has been
characterized for invasive and metastatic behavior when
injected intravascularly into chicken embryos [14]. We
determined that ML327 induced an 8-fold increase in
E-cadherin mRNA by 6 hours after treatment in the HEp3
cells (Figure 3A) and a significant increase in E-cadherin
protein expression by 24 hours after ML327 treatment
(Figure 3B) as compared with DMSO or 266Y control
treatments that did not alter E-cadherin expression.
In the CAM experimental model system, 100,000
GFP-labeled HEp3 cells were injected intravascularly
into 10 day old chicken embryos and allowed to migrate
and form tumor colonies as previously described [14].
Embryos were treated with ML327 or 266Y at 24 hours
after tumor cell injections and colony formation was
assessed by fluorescence imaging at 6 and 8 days postinjection. We observed measurable and reproducible

inhibition of tumor cell motility at both time points, as
reflected in the limited number of single cells dispersing
from the colonies when the embryos are treated with
ML327 (Figure 3C-3D, Supplementary Figure 2A),
suggesting that ML327 has the ability to impair cancer
cell migration in vivo.

Small-molecule ML327 modulates E-cadherin
mRNA levels independently of de novo protein
synthesis
We previously reported that treatment of SW620
cells with first generation molecules resulted in
significant induction of E-cadherin mRNA by 24 hours
after exposure[10]. Here, we extended these studies to
determine the effect of ML327 at the transcriptional
level. We found that ML327 induced significant increases
in E-cadherin mRNA levels by as early as 3 hours after

treatment in the SW620inv cells (Figure 4A). By 6
hours post-treatment, ML327 increased E-cadherin
mRNA expression 25-fold in SW620inv cells and 12fold in H520 cells (Supplementary Figure3A). We also
determined the kinetics of altered E-cadherin expression
by ML327 in SW620inv cells by Western blot. By 6 hours
post-treatment with ML327, E-cadherin protein levels
in SW260inv cells were increased when compared with
DMSO vehicle or 266Y treatment. The E-cadherin protein
levels continued increasing through 12, 18, and 24 hours
post-treatment (Figure 4B). Similar results were obtained
in H520 cells (Supplementary Figure 3B). In addition,
we found that ML327 increased E-cadherin expression in
two other lung cancer cell lines (H460, H661) and in 2
non-transformed cell lines (HEK293T, HMEC1 (human
microvascular endothelial cell)) (Supplementary Figure
3C).
Since ML327 increased E-cadherin mRNA levels
within 3 hours, we determined whether de novo protein
synthesis was required for the effect of ML327 on
E-cadherin mRNA expression. For these experiments,
we treated cells with cycloheximide, to block protein
translation, 1 hour prior to application of ML327 and
evaluated expression of E-cadherin mRNA at 6 hours
post-treatment. Levels of cyclin D1 protein, which has a
very short half-life of ~20 minutes [15], were assessed as
a positive control for the effectiveness of cycloheximide
treatment. Cycloheximide treatment did not prevent the
increase in E-cadherin mRNA levels in response to the
ML327 treatment (Figure 4C). As expected, cyclin D1
protein levels were markedly reduced within the 7 hour
experimental interval, but the more stable β-actin protein
levels were not significantly altered (Figure 4D-4E).
Thus, we conclude from these results that de novo protein
synthesis is not required for the ML327-induced increase
in E-cadherin mRNA expression.

Importantly, significant ML327-responsive activity
was retained with the proximal (173bp) region of the
E-cadherin promoter (Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure
4).
Repression of E-cadherin expression involves
various epigenetic mechanisms that may include
histone modification and/or DNA methylation[17].
Histone modifications, such as methylation, acetylation,
and ubiquitination, are linked to gene activation or
silencing depending on the precise nature and position
of the modification. Promoters of expressed genes
are commonly associated with active histone marks,
such as Histone3 (H3) lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me,
H3K4me2, or H3K4me3) and H3 lysine 9 acetylation
(H3K9Ac). In contrast, the chromatin-containing
transcriptionally silenced or repressed genes are enriched
with binding of histone repressive marks, including H3
lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and H3 lysine 9
methylation (H3K9me2, or H3K9me3) [9]. Since binding
of specifically modified histones and RNA polymerase
II (Pol II) are markers of active gene transcription,
we determined whether ML327-induced E-cadherin
expression is associated with increased Pol II and
activated histone marks in chromatin associated with the
promoter of CDH1 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays were performed using antibodies against
Pol II, H3K4me3, H3K9Ac, and H3K27me3 in SW620inv
cells treated with DMSO, 266Y or ML327 for 4 hours.
We observed significantly enriched binding of Pol II (4.6fold), H3K4me3 (2.1-fold), and H3K9Ac (3.4-fold) to
the CDH1 promoter after treatment of SW620inv cells
with ML327, and there was no significant difference in
H3K27me3 binding after treatment of cells with ML327
(Figure 5B-5C). In contrast, the inactive compound 266Y
did not show any effect on Pol II occupancy on the CDH1
proximal promoter (Figure 5B). In the same experiment,
there was no difference binding of Pol II to the GAPDH
promoter after treatment of cells with ML327 (Figure 5B).
These data suggest that ML327 activates transcription of
CDH1 and that the cis-acting elements for this response
are present in the proximal 5’ region of the CDH1
promoter.

ML327 activates transcription at the CDH1
promoter
To determine if the mechanism of ML327 action
involves altered E-cadherin transcription, we conducted
experiments using a series of human CDH1 promoter
driven reporter constructs. The full-length CDH1 promoter
(1130bp) encodes consensus binding sequences for several
known transcription factors, including AML1, HNF3,
P300, SP1, and SNAI [16]. We found that ML327 induces
a > 20-fold increase in full-length reporter activation over
266Y. Serial deletion of the distal regions of the promoter
reduced the ML327 effect on reporter activation from ~30fold to between 10- and 20-fold above control. Diminution
of activity was most pronounced when the region between
-357bp to -195bp, containing consensus binding sequences
for HNF3, P300, AML1 and E-box binding protein (Snail,
Slug, Zeb1, and Zeb2) transcription factors was deleted.

ML327 reprograms gene expression, implicating
regulation of HNF4α
We performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis
to evaluate the effect of ML327 on global gene expression
patterns in SW620inv and H520. For these experiments,
cells (n = 3 per group) were exposed to either DMSO
or ML327 in the presence of cycloheximide for 3 hours
prior to harvest. To identify genes differentially expressed
in ML327-treated cells compared to DMSO-treated
cells, we performed count-based differential expression
analysis[18]. Using a cutoff of FDR < 0.0001, we found

process of embryonic development (575 genes, righttailed Fisher’s Exact Test, p < 1.5 x 10-7). Hepatocyte
nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), TP53 and Nuclear protein
transcriptional regulator 1 (NUPR1) were the top three
upstream regulators significantly implicated for common
differentially expressed genes found in this analysis,
including CDH1 (right-tailed Fisher’s Exact Tests, p < 2 x
10-27, p < 3 x 10-15 and p < 2 x10-14, respectively) (Figure
6C, Supplementary Figure 7A and 7B).
To determine whether ML327 induction of
E-cadherin involves HNF4α activity, we first inhibited
HNF4α expression by small interfering RNA-mediated
depletion. Both mRNA and protein expression levels
of HNF4α were markedly reduced by specific HNF4α
targeting siRNA (Figure 7A and 7C). The effect of
ML327 on E-cadherin mRNA expression was significantly
reduced from 9-fold to less than 3-fold increase after the
depletion of HNF4α expression (Figure 7B). Loss of
HNF4α also significantly diminished the effect of ML327
on the E-cadherin protein levels as shown by Western blot
(Figure 7C, Supplementary Figure 8). Interestingly, we
observed that the HNF4α protein level was elevated after
6 hours ML327 treatment, comparing the control siRNA
treated with DMSO, or ML327 (Figure 7C). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of HNF4α protein
binding to several CDH1 promoter regions containing
predicted HNF4α binding sites (Supplementary Figure
4) was performed in SW620inv cell lysed after treatment
with DMSO or ML327 for 4 hours. We observed
significantly enriched binding (6-10 folds) of HNF4α
protein to the CDH1 promoter at three different consensus
binding regions, but only a slight (1.7-fold) increase in
binding of HNF4α to the GAPDH promoter region after
the same treatment. (Figure 7D, Supplementary Figure
9). Interestingly, we observed that suppression of HNF4α
expression attenuated, but did not completely prevent
the induction of E-cadherin expression in response to
ML327 (Figure 7B and 7C). Furthermore HNF4α siRNA
did not inhibit the ML327 induction of other target genes
identified above, including Snail and NFATC2 mRNAs
(Supplementary Figure 10), demonstrating that HNF4α
is not likely to be the direct target or primary effector
downstream of the ML327 action in cells. Taken together,
the above results confirm that HNF4α is an important
transcriptional enhancer of E-cadherin expression
whose activity is necessary for the maximum induction
of E-cadherin in response to ML327 and that the effects
of HNF4α are likely downstream of the direct molecular
target of ML327.

that expression of 5658 genes was significantly altered
in SW620inv cells (2881 upregulated genes, 2777
down-regulated genes) and that expression of 3667
genes was significantly altered in H520 cells (1792
upregulated genes, 1875 down-regulated genes) (Figure
6A, supplementary data report 1-2). To further control
for false-positive discoveries and focus on a common
mechanism in both SW620inv and H520 cells, we took the
intersection of the lists of differentially expressed genes in
these two cell lines to derive a list of 2578 differentially
expressed genes that were in common for both cell lines
(Figure 6B). Among these 2578 differentially expressed
genes, ~40% were upregulated and 60% down-regulated
in both lines, the top 50 up-regulated or down-regulated
genes were listed (Supplementary table). In total, 953
genes, including CDH1, were upregulated in both lines.
Differential expression of four of the genes identified by
RNAseq was confirmed in both SW620inv and H520
cells by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figure 5). SNAIL/
SLUG (SNAI1/2) proteins are zinc finger “E-box”
binding transcription factors expressed in cells known to
regulate EMT and to participate in CDH1 repression [19].
However, in our study, we observed that both SNAIL1
and Snail2/Slug mRNA levels were increased by ML327
treatment (Supplementary Figure 5). SNAIL1 protein
levels were markedly increased in SW620inv cells after
treatment with ML327 for 3 hours, while SLUG/SNAIL2
protein levels were minimally changed (Supplementary
Figure 6A). Interestingly, we inhibited SNAIL1 expression
by small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated depletion in
SW620inv cells, then treated with DMSO or ML327 for 24
hours and observed that E-cadherin protein levels were not
increased after marked depletion of SNAIL1. E-cadherin
protein levels were increased similarly by ML327
treatment regardless of SNAIL1 depletion by siRNA.
ML327 treatment increased Snail1 protein levels in the
presence of Snail1 siRNA, but the level of Snail1 protein
increase was reduced in comparison with the scrambled
siRNA control conditions (Supplementary Figure 6B). It
has been previously reported that SNAIL1 binds to its own
promoter to repress transcription [20]. Our data suggest
that a similar mechanism of de-repression of CDH1 and
SNAI1 gene transcription may be involved in the response
to ML327. Our data also suggest that ML327 increases
E-cadherin expression despite a paradoxical increase in
binding of SNAIL to the E-cadherin promoter, and that
SNAIL1 does not appear to be an important contributor to
CDH1 transcriptional repression in these SW620 cancer
cells.
Functional enrichment analysis of our RNAseq
data by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that
significantly more differentially expressed genes were
involved in protein ubiquitination (255 genes, right-tailed

DISCUSSION
Achieving chemical control of EMT is an
attractive goal for experimental cancer therapeutics. We
have previously described a series of experiments using
22943

Oncotarget

high throughput whole cell screening to identify and
characterize a chemical compound that restores E-cadherin
in colon cancer and lung cancer cells in which E-cadherin
is transcriptionally repressed [10]. In the current report, we
find that an efficacy-improved compound, ML327, induces
E-cadherin transcription and inhibits cell invasion in
culture, with little to no toxicity at effective concentrations
in SW620inv and H520 cells. ML327 E-cadherin inducing
responses were observed in a variety of cancer and nontransformed cells, including the HMEC1 cells that are

endothelial in origin. Furthermore, our data demonstrate
that ML327 treatment alters the transcription of multiple
genes without the need for de novo protein synthesis.
This suggests that the direct intracellular target of the
compound is an important central regulatory node
that coordinates or modulates the activation of several
downstream transcriptional networks.
Tumor cell dissemination is critical in cancer
progression and involves multiple processes that lead to
the dissemination of metastases to remote loci. Epithelial

to mesenchymal transition is characterized by decreased
cell-cell adhesion, increased motility, and invasive
properties that may allow carcinoma cells to detach from
the primary tumor and invade surrounding tissue, through
collective or individual cell migration [7]. To examine
the effect of ML327 on EMT, we studied its activity in
the classical model system of TGF-β induced EMT in
NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial gland cells. Our data
indicated that ML327 partially reverses typical molecular
features of established EMT in this experimental system.
Cell migration and metastasis are key features of
aggressive tumors that are difficult to study in vivo, as
they not readily accessible within the body of a cancer
patient or an experimental animal. In vitro studies such
as invasion assays and migration assays can model some
aspects of these processes, but have inherent limitations
that may miss important aspects of the processes as they
occur in vivo. The CAM assay is a quantifiable in vivo
model to study metastases and tumor cell migration that
overcomes many limitations of the in vitro studies [14,
21]. We determined that ML327 inhibits cancer cell
motility in vivo as reflected by both reduced colony size
and a pronounced inhibition of single cell migration from
metastatic colonies forming in the chick embryo.
Epigenetic regulation (DNA methylation, histone
modification, and microRNAs) has been shown to play a
key role in controlling EMT processes. Epigenetics is an
important area for potential therapeutic targeting in cancer
[9]. The inhibitors of DNMT and HDAC have been shown
in preclinical studies to selectively target cancer cells with
suppression of metastasis that has been experimentally
correlated with E-cadherin upregulation [22, 23]. In fact,
we observed increased levels of E-cadherin in response
to the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (as shown in
Supplementary Figure 1A). In this study, we observed
significantly enriched binding of histone active marks
(H3K4me3 and H3K9Ac) to the CDH1 promoter after
treatment of SW620inv cells with ML327. Suspecting
that ML327 was functioning as a direct HDAC inhibitor,
we screened ML327 activity in HDAC inhibition assays
(HDAC class I, II, and IV) [10] and sirtuin (HDAC class
III) (H.A., unpublished results), but found no evidence
for direct inhibition by ML327. We have also shown
that ML327 can restore E-cadherin expression in human
microvascular endothelial cell-HMEC-1 (supplementary
Figure 3), but E-cadherin expression could not be restored
by treatment with DNMT inhibitor, 5-azacytidine in the
HMEC-1 cells (unpublished observations, H.A.). Even
though our observations suggest either direct or indirect
regulation of epigenetic processes, further research will be
required to identify the direct target of ML327.
In this study, RNAseq analyses were conducted to
evaluate the effect of ML327 on global gene expression
patterns in SW620inv and H520 and to provide inferential
clues as to the direct intracellular target of the compound.
Functional enrichment analysis by IPA showed that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HNF4α was the top significantly implicated upstream
transcriptional regulator for common differentially
expressed genes found in this analysis, including CDH1.
HNF4α has previously been reported to be a central
regulator of cell adhesion protein expression in the liver
parenchyma of the mouse [24]. Expression of HNF4α has
also been linked to regulation of E-cadherin expression
in previous studies [25]. We identified twenty-one
potential HNF4α binding sites within 1000 bp upstream
and downstream of the CDH1 transcription initiation
site using TRANSFAC in silico analysis. We found that
ML327 increased HNF4α binding to the CDH1 promoter
within a time-frame consistent with the induction of
E-cadherin mRNA. Importantly, RNAi knockdown
of HNF4α expression significantly, but incompletely,
diminished the effect of ML327 on the E-cadherin mRNA
and protein levels. However, we observed that knocking
down HNF4α had no effect on the increases in Snail1 or
NFATc2 mRNAs that were induced by ML327 treatment.
Taken together, these data lead us to conclude that HNF4α
is not likely to be the direct intracellular molecular target
of ML327, but its actions are downstream of the direct
target. Ongoing research is aimed at identifying the direct
molecular target of ML327 upstream of the multiple
genes that are transcriptionally activated in response to
the chemical probe.
Identification of the direct molecular target
for ML327 is likely to yield important information
regarding coordinated regulation of broad transcriptional
networks. We anticipate that it will also enable improved
understanding and targeting of the pathological EMT
process that could be exploited for therapeutic potential
in cancer. Therefore, ML327 represents a novel chemical
structure with potential for continued pharmacological
optimization toward the development of novel
therapeutics. The compound ML327 is freely available
from the Molecular Library Probe Center Network
(MPLCN).

RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. RNAs were reverse
transcribed using Transcriptor Universal cDNA Master
mix. cDNA was analyzed using a quantitative PCR
(qPCR) with LightCycler® 480 Instrument II . All
PCR instrumentation and reagents were obtained
from Roche Biologicals (Basel, Switzerland) with the
exception of primers, which were obtained through IDT
Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). For primer sequences,
see supplementary materials and methods.

Immunofluorescence analysis
NMuMg cells (5 × 104/well) were seeded on
8-well chamber slides for 24 hours prior to treatment.
After treatments, the cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed
with 100% methanol for 15 min at 4°C. The cells were
rinsed with PBS and blocked and permeabilized with 2%
BSA and 0.2% TritonX-100 in PBS. The cells were then
incubated with anti-E-cadherin antibody (BD Transduction
Laboratories) and diluted in (1:50) 1% BSA in PBS
blocking solution overnight at 4°C. After 3 washes with
PBS, the cells were incubated with appropriate secondary
antibodies conjugated to fluorescein (1:200; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) or Texas Red (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and DAPI (1:2000, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 40
min at RT. The cells were washed 3 times with PBS and
then mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were captured on
an Olympus FV-1000 fluorescent microscope.

RNA from SW620inv and H520 cancer cells (n =
3 per group) exposed to either DMSO or ML327 in the
presence of cycloheximide for 3 hours was collected using
RNeasy kits. Processing of RNA using a TruSeq Stranded
mRNA sample prep kit was conducted according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
Approximately 27-36 million 50 base pair single-end
reads were generated, per sample. We mapped the reads
to the human genome hg19 using TopHat-2.0.10[28].
About 96% or more of the reads were mapped to the
genome. Then, following the method of Anders[29],
we counted the number of reads that fall into annotated
genes by samtools-0.1.19[30] and HTSeq-0.5.4p5[31].
Finally, we performed count-based differential expression
analysis using edgeR_3.4.2[18] which implements general
differential analyses based on the negative binomial
model.
