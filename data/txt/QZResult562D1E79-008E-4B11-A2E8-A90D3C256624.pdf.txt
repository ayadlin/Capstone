Abstract
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Effects of susceptibility variants may depend on from which parent they are inherited. While many
associations between sequence variants and human traits have been discovered through genomewide associations, the impact of parental origin has largely been ignored. Combining genealogy
with long range phasing, we demonstrate that for 38,167 Icelanders genotyped using SNP chips,
the parental origin of most alleles can be determined. We then focused on SNPs that associate with
diseases and are within 500kb of known imprinted genes. Seven independent SNP associations
were examined. Five, one each with breast cancer and basal cell carcinoma, and three with type 2
diabetes (T2D), exhibit parental-origin specific associations. These variants are located in two
genomic regions, 11p15 and 7q32, each harbouring a cluster of imprinted genes. Furthermore, a
novel variant rs2334499 at 11p15 was seen to associate with T2D where the allele that confers risk
when paternally inherited is protective when maternally transmitted. We identified a differentially

The effect of sequence variants on phenotypes may depend on parental origin. The most
obvious scenario, although not the only one1, is imprinting where the effect is limited to the
allele inherited from a parent of specific sex. Despite this, most reports of genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) treated the paternal and maternal alleles as exchangeable.
While this is understandable as the information required is often unavailable, it reduces the
power to discover some susceptibility variants and underestimates the effects of others,
contributing to unexplained heritability. Here we describe a new method that allows us to
systematically determine parental origin of haplotypes even when parents of probands are
not genotyped. The results are used to discover associations that exhibit parental-origin
specific effects.

DETERMINING PARENTAL ORIGIN

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Previously2, we introduced the method of long range phasing that allows for accurate
phasing of Icelandic samples typed with Illumina bead chips for regions up to10 cMs in
length. Two advances have been made since then, stitching and parental origin
determination. Genome-wide, long range phasing was applied to overlapping tiles, each 6
cM in length, with 3 cM overlap between consecutive tiles. For each tile, we attempted to
determine the parental origins of the two phased haplotypes regardless of whether the
parents of the proband were chip-typed. Using the Icelandic genealogy database, for each of
the two haplotypes of a proband, a search was performed to identify, among those
individuals also known to carry the same haplotype, the closest relative on each of the
paternal and maternal sides (Figure 1). Results for the two haplotypes were combined into a
robust single-tile score reflecting the relative likelihood of the two possible parental origin
assignments (score > 0 supporting one assignment and score < 0 supporting the other
assignment, see Methods for details). We then tried to stitch the haplotypes from
consecutive tiles together based on sharing at the overlapping region. Stitching and parental
origin determination are complementary tasks. Specifically, if parental origin is determined
with high confidence for one tile the information can be propagated to other tiles through
stitching (Supplementary Figure 1A). Conversely, in cases where the overlap between two
adjacent tiles is homozygous for all SNPs, stitching can still be accomplished if parental
origins can be determined for both tiles independently (Supplementary Figure 1B). For
haplotypes derived by stitching, a contig-score for parental origin is computed by summing
the individual single-tile scores.
After filtering based on various quality and yield criteria, 289,658 autosomal markers and
8,411 markers on chromosome X were used. Excluding those with no parent listed in the
genealogy database or with less than 98% genotyping yield, 38,167 individuals, a majority
typed with Illumia HumanHap300/CNV370 bead chips (Supplementary Information), were
processed. For these individuals, 97.8% of the heterozygous genotypes were long range
phased, 99.8% of these had parental origin determined. Overall, 3,841,331,873 heterozygous
genotypes, 97.7% of those called, had parental origin assigned. The data includes 2,879
typed trios. To empirically evaluate the accuracy of our method, a run was performed with
the data of parents in these trios removed when determining parental origin. For
231,585,437 heterozygous genotypes in the probands/offspring, parental origin was
determined both by our method and by the trio data directly, with 500,330 discrepancies, an
error rate of 500,300/231,585,437 = 0.22%. Since the trios tested have passed heritability
checks in pre-processing, the error rate for individuals with fewer than two parents
genotyped is probably higher. Still, the overall error rate is likely below 0.4%
(Supplementary Information).

IMPRINTING AND DISEASE ASSOCIATION

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

While many mechanisms can lead to parental origin specific association with a phenotype, a
priori sequence variants located close to imprinted genes are more likely to exhibit such
behaviour. Through two sources, Luedi et al.3 and the Imprinted Gene Catalogue4, 5, we
found forty eight genes known to be imprinted in humans (Supplementary Table 1).
Selecting regions that fall within 500 kb of any of these genes (Build 36 of the Human
Genome Assembly) amounts to approximately 1% of the genome. The 500 kb threshold was
chosen because imprinted genes often occur in clusters and the imprinting status of genes
close to known imprinted genes is often undetermined. It is also known that a sequence
variant can directly affect the function of a gene located some distance away. Among the
298,069 SNPs we processed, 3840 fall within these selected regions.
Consulting the Catalogue of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies6, we intersected
reported SNP-disease associations with P < 5 × 10−8 with the selected regions
(Supplementary Table 2). Further restricting to diseases for which we have published
genome scans, 4 associations remained. Three other SNP associations we were aware of that
fall within the imprinted regions, one recently published by us for basal cell carcinoma7 and
two established by the Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM)
Consortium, were also examined.

ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For each disease-SNP association, five tests were performed (Table 1). A standard casecontrol test without taking parental origin into account was performed to provide a baseline.
Then a case-control analysis was performed separately for the paternally and maternally
inherited alleles. A two-degree of freedom test was applied to evaluate the joint effect. A
multiplicative model was assumed for the two alleles, but the magnitude and direction of the
effect were allowed to differ. Finally, the difference between the effects of the paternally
and maternally inherited alleles was directly tested by comparing their allele frequencies
within cases. The information for this test mainly comes from the counts of the two types of
heterozygotes within cases. (see Supplementary Information for details).
Among the 7 associations examined, one with prostate cancer (PrC) and another with
coronary artery disease (CAD), did not exhibit parental-origin specific effects
(Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 3). The 5 associations that did are
presented here.
Breast Cancer
Allele C of rs3817198 in the 11p15 region (Figure 2) was reported8 to be associated with
breast cancer with an allelic OR of 1.07 (P = 3 × 10−9 ). This study included about 21,860
cases and 22,578 controls allowing for such a modest effect to achieve genome-wide
significance. A study9 of CGEMS (The Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility Project)
with 9,770 cases and 10,799 controls reported ORs of 1.02 and 1.12 for heterozygous and
homozygous carriers of the same variant respectively. Using information in their
supplementary material, we deduced a P of 0.06. Rs3817198 is not on the Illumina chips
used to type the majority of the Icelandic samples, but is included on the 1M Illumina chips
for which we have data on 124 trios. Single track assay was used to type another 90 trios,
giving a total of 214 trios with genotypes for rs3817198 that translates to a training set of
856 haplotypes. Adapting the statistical model employed by IMPUTE10, allele probabilities
of rs3817198 were calculated for individuals with phased and parental origin determined
haplotypes for this region (see Supplementary Information for details). With the imputation
results for 1,803 cases and 34,909 controls (Table 1), the standard case-control test gave a

non-significant OR of 1.04 (P = 0.36). However, when parental origin was taken into
account, the paternally inherited allele showed a significant association (OR = 1.17, P =
0.0038). The direct test of parental-origin specific effects that used only the case data was
even more significant (P = 6.2 × 10−4). This is because the estimated effect of the C allele
when maternally inherited, while not significant (P = 0.11), is protective (OR = 0.91).

Basal Cell Carcinoma
We recently identified association of allele T of rs157935, located at 7q32 (Figure 3), with
basal cell carcinoma (OR = 1.23, P = 5.7 × 10−10)7. Limiting the analysis to samples for
which parental origin could be determined, the paternally inherited allele was significantly
associated with the disease (OR = 1.40, P = 1.5 × 10−6), but the effect of maternally
inherited allele, while in the same direction, was not significant (OR = 1.09, P = 0.19)
(Table 1). Tested directly, the effects of the paternally and maternally inherited alleles were
significantly different (P = 0.010).
Type 2 Diabetes
Allele C of rs2237892 in the maternally expressed gene KCNQ1 was first observed to
associated with T2D in Asian populations11, 12. Power to detect association in populations of
European ancestry is low due to the high frequency of the variant there (~93% compared to
~61% in Asians), but the association has nonetheless been replicated11, 12. In the T2D
samples we have previously employed in genome-scans (Table 1) that include 1,468 cases,
none of the tests involving parental origin were significant for rs2237892. But when a new
T2D list (Supplementary Information) allowed us to add 783 patients, giving a total of 2,251
cases, allele C was significantly associated with the disease (OR = 1.30, P = 0.0084) when
maternally transmitted, while the results for the paternally inherited allele were flat (OR =
1.03, P = 0.71).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Through a meta-analysis of large numbers of T2D genome-wide scans with additional
follow-up within the DIAGRAM consortium (Supplementary Information), allele C of
rs231362 was shown to associate with the disease (OR = 1.08, P = 3 × 10−13). Rs231362 is
also located in KCNQ1 (Figure 2), but it is not substantially correlated with rs2237892 (r2 =
0.002). Rs231362 is not on any of the Illumina chips used. A training set of 912 haplotypes,
created through single track assay genotyping of 228 trios, was used for imputation of
rs231362 into the Icelandic samples. Employing the imputed results, the standard casecontrol test gave an OR of 1.10 (P = 0.013). The effect, however, appears to be limited to the
maternally inherited allele (OR = 1.23, P = 6.2 × 10−5).
Another association with T2D established by the DIAGRAM consortium is allele C of
rs4731702 at 7q32 (OR = 1.07, P = 2 × 10−10) (Figure 3). In our combined samples, the
association was again restricted to the maternally inherited allele (OR = 1.17, P = 0.0010)
(OR = 0.99, P = 0.79 for the paternally inherited allele).
Evaluating the 7 known susceptibility variants jointly, the five highlighted above plus the
two variants for PrC and CAD mentioned earlier, the test of no parental-specific effect for
all gave a P < 5 × 10−6. Also, false-discovery rate13 analysis indicates that it is likely that at
least four out of five highlighted variants have true parental-origin specific effect
(Supplementary Information).
A novel diabetes susceptibility variant
Properly evaluating the statistical significance of the susceptibility variants described above
requires adjusting for relatedness of the participants using the method of genomic control14.
This required performing genome scans for these diseases (Supplementary Table 4 gives

parental-origin test results for established susceptibility variants located outside the selected
regions). The T2D scan performed with the initial sample set (Supplementary Information
and Supplementary Figure 2) gave a striking result (Table 1). Allele T of rs2334499, at
11p15 (Figure 2), showed such a weak association (OR = 1.11, P = 0.017) in the standard
case-control test that it does not stand out in a genome-wide scan. However, taking into
account parental origin, both the paternally inherited allele (OR = 1.41, P = 4.3 × 10−9) and
the 2-df of freedom test (P = 3.5 × 10−9) were genome-wide significant. Most intriguing, the
maternally inherited allele also showed nominally significant association, but the effect of
allele T was protective (OR = 0.87, P = 0.020). Tested directly, the difference between the
effects of the paternally and maternally inherited alleles was also genome-wide significant
(P = 7.0 × 10−9). This SNP falls within 350 Kb of a large cluster of imprinted genes, making
the results even more compelling. Still, the observation that allele T is protective when
maternally inherited called for replication. For this, we used an additional set of 783 chiptyped T2D cases. All tests involving parental origin were significantly replicated. For the
combined analysis of the two sample sets (Supplementary Information and Supplementary
Figure 3), the paternally inherited allele had an OR of 1.35 (P = 4.7 × 10−10) and the
maternally inherited allele has an OR of 0.86 (P = 0.0020). The 2-df test and the paternal
versus maternal tests gave P of 5.7 × 10−11 and 4.1 × 10−11 respectively.
As there are known examples in an imprinted setting where the paternal and maternal alleles
interact15, we tested rs2334499 for an interactive effect. This test was not significant (P >
0.4, Supplementary Information) indicating that the multiplicative model provides an
adequate fit. Specifically, compared to CT (first allele paternal, second allele maternal), CC,
TT and TC have relative risks of 1.17, 1.35 and 1.57 respectively.
The transmitted maternal allele has an effect in all four T2D variants in Table 1. Since
prenatal maternal conditions may be a factor in conferring risk on the offspring, we
examined the role of the non-transmitted maternal allele. No significant effect was observed
(Supplementary Information).

IMPRINTED REGIONS ON 11p15 AND 7q32
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Imprinted genes at 11p15.5 fall into two clusters, H19/IGF2 and KCNQ1 (Figure 2),
regulated through separate imprinting control regions (ICR) that each controls expression of
a number of genes within the cluster16. The H19/IGF2 ICR is regulated through a
differentially methylated region (DMR) that is normally methylated only on the paternal
chromosome. Binding of the insulator protein CTCF in the ICR is permitted only on the
unmethylated maternal chromosome, resulting in expression of IGF2 only from the paternal
methylated chromosome and expression of H19 from the choromosome17. The breast cancer
paternally associated marker rs3817198 resides within LSP1, 100 kb downstream of H19
and within the same LD block. The effect of this marker on breast cancer could thus be
through the H19/IGF2 imprinted locus. Loss of imprinting (LOI) at the H19/IGF2 locus,
resulting in activation of IGF2 expression, has been reported in a number of different tumor
types18. Furthermore, LOI at the H19/IGF2 locus in normal tissue has also been shown to
predispose to colorectal cancer18.
The KCNQ1 cluster is regulated through an ICR located in the promoter region of
KCNQ1OT1, a paternally expressed non-coding antisense RNA. Hypermethylation of the
maternal allele results in monoallelic activity of the neighboring maternally expressed
protein coding genes. The two T2D associated markers at this locus rs231362 and
rs2237892 are both located within the maternally expressed KCNQ1, consistent with the risk
associations. Rs231362 also residing within the KCNQ1OT1 antisense transcript (Figure 2).

While both the T2D marker rs2334499 and the breast cancer marker rs3817198 fall within
350 kb of imprinted genes, the region harboring both rs2334499 and rs3817198 has not been
reported to be imprinted (Figure 2)19 The T2D associated marker rs2334499 resides within
the first intron of HCCA2, a gene spanning 300 kb including several other genes (Figure 2)
including KRTAP5-1 to -5 genes, DUSP8 and CTSD20. To determine if genes in this region
showed signs of imprinting we performed allele specific expression analysis of the HCCA2,
CTSD and DUSP8 genes (Figure 2) as well as three genes known to be imprinted in the
11p15.5 region (IGF2, KCNQ1 and KCNQ1OT1, in RNA isolated from peripheral blood
and adipose. While allele specific expression of IGF2, KCNQ1 and KCNQ1OT1 was
confirmed in this dataset clear biallelic expression was seen for HCCA2 and DUSP8.
However, excess paternal expression could not be ruled out for CTSD (Supplementary
Information, Supplementary Table 6).
The imprinted region on 7q32 consists of maternally expressed genes (CPA4 and KLF14)
flanking paternally expressed genes (MEST, MESTIT1) (Figure 3). The T2D associated
marker rs4731702 is located 14 kb from the maternally expressed KLF14 transcription
factor21 and only increases risk of T2D when carried on the maternal chromosome. The
basal cell carcinoma variant rs157935, conferring risk through the paternal allele, is located
170 kb telomeric to the imprinted region.
We previously22 correlated SNP genotypes from the Illumina 300K chip to gene expression
using RNA samples from adipose tissue (N=603) and peripheral blood (N=745). Here,
taking parental origin into account, we re-evaluated the correlation between the six variants
in Table 1 and expression of genes at the 7q32 and 11p15.5 loci. Interestingly, the T2D risk
allele of rs4731702 at 7q32 correlated with lower expression of KLF14 in adipose tissue (P
= 3 × 10−21) when inherited maternally, but there was no effect when inherited paternally
(Supplementary Table 7). Similar correlation was not seen in blood. Conversely, no strong
correlation with parent of origin specific gene expression was seen for the other disease
associated variants on 7q32 or 11p15.5 (Supplementary Table 7).

METHYLATION OF NOVEL CTCF BINDING SITE
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Recent studies have mapped regions of CTCF binding genome-wide for identification of
insulator elements23, 24. One of the sites identified (OREG0020670) is a 2 kb region located
17 kb centromeric to our new T2D marker rs2334499 (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 4).
We assessed the methylation status of this CTCF binding region in DNA samples derived
from peripheral blood, using bisulfite sequencing. We identified a differentially methylated
region of 180 bp including seven CpG dinucleotides (Supplementary Figure 4) where the
ratio of 5-methyl cytosine (Cp) varied from around 0.1-0.6. Methylation at five of the seven
CpGs (CpG-1 through CpG-5) (Supplementary Figure 4), was highly correlated
(Supplementary Table 9). The estimated Cp ratio was tested for correlation with SNPs in a 2
Mb surrounding region. The most significant correlation was observed between methylation
status at CpG-4 and rs2334499, P = 2.6 × 10−13 (Table 2). Furthermore, correlation between
rs2334499 and methylation of CpG-1 through CpG-5 was significant. For all five CpGs the
T2D risk allele correlated with decreased methylation and this effect was observed
regardless of whether the allele was inherited from the father or the mother. By contrast,
neither the breast cancer variant nor the two other T2D markers at 11p15.5 showed any
correlation with the methylation status of this CTCF site.

DISCUSSION
Being able to determine parental origin of alleles and haplotypes in large samples opens up
new avenues to study associations between sequence variants and human traits. Standard

association analysis provides suboptimal power to discover disease susceptibility variants
that exhibit parental-origin specific effects. Even when association can be established, the
true effect is underestimated. Rs2334499 did not capture serious attention even with the
large collaborative effort of the DIAGRAM consortium. However, its contribution to T2D,
measured by the recurrent risks of siblings generated, is second only to that of the TCF7L2
variant among the known susceptibility variants (Supplementary Information and
Supplementary Figure 2). Sequence variants such as rs2334499 that can confer both risk and
protection depending on parental origin can lead to balanced selection and in that promote
diversity.
Functional imprinting is extremely tissue and stage-specific and while some genes retain
their imprinted status throughout life the main role of imprinting is believed to be during
prenatal growth and development. However, the associations of rs4731702 C with T2D and
KLF14 expression in adult adipose tissue, in both cases only when maternally inherited,
strongly implicates this transcription factor as the disease gene.
We searched for evidence of epigenetic marks around the novel T2D risk variant rs2334499,
as it is located some distance away from the established 11p15.5 imprinted genes. A CTCF
binding site in the region was found to be differentially mehtylated and the rs2334499 risk
allele was shown to be correlated with decreased methylation. Given the well established
role of CTCF in imprinting, this novel site could differentially influence the dosage of
imprinted genes on the two parental chromosomes.
Despite the successes, GWAS have so far yielded sequence variants that only explain a
small fraction of the estimated heritability of most of the human traits studied. Obvious
contributors to the unexplained heritability, or Dark Matter, include rare variants not well
tagged by common SNPs and common variants that have very small effects individually.
Results presented here demonstrate that a portion of the heritability of some common/
complex traits is hidden in more complex relations between sequence variants and the risks
of these variants.

METHODS
Parental Origin Assignment
Let H be a haplotype for a tile T. For a particular proband, f(T,H) and m(T,H) were
calculated as respectively the meiotic distance to the closest relative on the father side and
the mother side known to carry H. Descendants of the parents of the proband, e.g. siblings of
the proband, were excluded for this calculation. Also, a value of 10,000 was assigned when
no relatives carrying the haplotype was found. Let A and B be the two phased haplotypes of
the proband. The single-tile score for parental origin was calculated as

A score that is > 0 supports the assignment of A as the paternally inherited haplotype and B
as the maternally inherited haplotype, while a score < 0 supports the reverse. While not
meant to be optimal in any formal sense, this scoring was chosen to have two properties.
Firstly, for the same absolute difference between m(T,H) and f(T,H), the absolute value of
score(T,H) is higher when the minimum of m(T,H) and f(T,H) is smaller, thus giving more
weight to situations when a close relative who shared a haplotype is found. Secondly, the
scoring was designed to be robust so that the result from one haplotype in one tile could not
completely dominate the contributions from other haplotypes and adjacent tiles when results

were combined (see below). When haplotypes for n consecutive tiles, T1,…,Tn, could be
stitched together to form A = (A1,…,An) and B = (B1,…,Bn), then the contig score for
parental origin assignment was calculated as

Parental original were assigned based on whether the contig-score was greater or smaller
than zero. Most importantly, the accuracy of this procedure was evaluated using the trio test.

Figure 1. An example of parental origin determination

In blue and red are two phased haplotypes of a proband. Among other typed individuals, the
closest paternal relative known to also carry the blue haplotype is R1, a cousin, while the
corresponding maternal relative is R2. For the red haplotype, a maternal aunt (R3) carries the
haplotype, while the closest known carrier on the father side is R4. Since R1 is a closer than
R2 and R3 is a closer than R4, the blue and red haplotypes are likely paternally and
maternally inherited respectively. The single-tile score (see Methods) supporting this
assignment is 0.194.

Genomic control was applied.

†

To directly test whether the paternally and maternally inherited alleles have different effects, their allele frequencies were compared within the cases. Information for this test is mainly captured by the
counts of the two types of heterozygotes: n12 denotes the number of cases who have inherited allele 1 from the father and allele 2 from the mother, and n21 is the reverse.

Test assumes a multiplicative effect for the paternally and maternally inherited alleles, but allows the effects to be different under the alternative hypothesis when the null hypothesis of no effect is tested.
