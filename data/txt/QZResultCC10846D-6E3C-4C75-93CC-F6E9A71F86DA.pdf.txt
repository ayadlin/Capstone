Abstract
Cdc25 phosphatases propel cell cycle progression by activating
cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk). DNA damage is generally
thought to inhibit Cdc25 functionality by inducing proteasomal
degradation of Cdc25A and phosphorylation-mediated sequestration of Cdc25B and Cdc25C to the cytoplasm. More recently,
a critical role for Cdc25B in the resumption of cell cycle
progression through mitosis after DNA damage has been
identified. In this study, the fate of Cdc25B after mechanistically
distinct DNA-damaging agents (etoposide, cisplatin, bleomycin,
ionizing irradiation, or UV irradiation) was examined, and
surprisingly a rapid increase in cellular Cdc25B levels was
observed after DNA damage. Using UV irradiation as the
prototypic damaging agent, we found that the increase in
Cdc25B levels was checkpoint dependent and was controlled by
a p53-independent mechanism. Cdc25B levels controlled the
number of cells progressing into mitosis after UV, but they did
not affect G2-M checkpoint engagement immediately after DNA
damage. Increased Cdc25B reduced the time required for cell
cycle resumption. These data support a model in which Cdc25B
accumulation is an important anticipatory event for cell cycle
resumption after DNA damage. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):3356–63]

Introduction
The Cdc25 subfamily of the protein tyrosine phosphatases are
important regulators of mammalian cell cycle checkpoints, which
control proliferation and genomic integrity (1). Cdc25 was initially
identified in fission yeast as a mitotic inducer (2). The three
mammalian homologues Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C positively
regulate cell cycle progression by activating their cyclin-dependent
kinase (Cdk)/cyclin substrates. Cdc25A primarily activates G1-S
specific Cdks (1) and is required for entry of cells into the S phase
and also regulates G2-M progression (3). Cdc25B and Cdc25C have
a more restricted role in promoting progression from G2 phase to
mitosis. Thus, microinjection of neutralizing Cdc25B and Cdc25C
antibodies into cells results in mitotic delay (4). Despite the
seemingly similarity in functions, Cdc25B and Cdc25C have
temporally distinct roles in cells with Cdc25B activity peaking
before Cdc25C (4). Cdc25B seems to activate a cytoplasmic pool of
Cdk1/cyclin B, triggering centrosomal microtubule nucleation (5).
Moreover, Cdc25B undergoes Aurora-A dependent phosphorylation
at the centrosome, which may permit entry into mitosis by

providing the first stimulus of Cdk1 activity (6). Therefore, Cdc25B
potentially has a unique role in initiating mitosis that warrants
further investigation.
Cdc25A and Cdc25B but not Cdc25C have documented
oncogenic properties (7). Overexpression of Cdc25B in human
tumors correlates with poor prognosis (8–10) and ectopic Cdc25B
overexpression in mammary glands increases susceptibility to
breast cancer induction by 9,10-dimethyl-1,2benzanthracene (11).
Previously, we found that benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide, the ultimate
carcinogen found in cigarette smoke, increases Cdc25B expression
in lung cancer cells, indicating that Cdc25B could contribute to
benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide induced lung carcinogenesis (12).
Eukaryotic cells have evolved surveillance mechanisms to guard
their DNA from genotoxic stress (13). One critical mechanism is
inhibition of cell cycle progression, thus allowing cells to repair
damaged DNA and preventing replication or transmission of
altered DNA to the next generation (13). To induce cell cycle arrest,
a complex signaling network is used to activate checkpoint kinases
Chk1 and Chk2 (14). These kinases induce proteasome-mediated
degradation of Cdc25A (15–20) and cytoplasmic retention of
Cdc25C mediated by phosphorylation of Ser216 (21). Cdc25B has
also been reported to be affected by at least some forms of
genotoxic stress. Thus, in response to UV, activation of the p38/
mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 signaling pathway leads to phosphorylation of Cdc25B at Ser309 and
subsequent 14-3-3 binding in vitro (22). Binding to 14-3-3 is thought
to restrict Cdc25B to the cytoplasm (23, 24). However, the nature of
the genotoxic insult as well as the magnitude of the DNA damage
may influence the final fate of Cdc25 family members (25, 26).
Although DNA damage clearly can cause cell cycle arrest, the
factors that control resumption of cell cycle have only recently
become the subject of attention. It seems that several components
of the eukaryotic checkpoint signaling pathway are essential for
resumption of cell cycle progression after genotoxic stress in a
process known as ‘‘recovery’’ (27). Specifically, polo-like kinase 1
and the serine/theronine phosphatase PPM1D were shown to
regulate cell cycle resumption after DNA damage–induced G2
arrest (28, 29). Chk1 and claspin, a regulator of Chk1 activation, are
targeted for degradation after replication stress to facilitate
resumption after genotoxic stress (30–32). The tyrosine phosphatase Cdc25B is also thought to be essential in regulating resumption of cell cycle progression after genotoxic stress (28, 33). Thus,
we have reevaluated the effects of different types of DNA-damaging
agents on Cdc25B. We now report that mechanistically distinct
DNA-damaging agents rapidly induced Cdc25B expression and that
levels of Cdc25B determined the kinetics of cell cycle resumption
after DNA damage–induced cell cycle arrest.

and U2OS-expressing HA-Cdc25B3 under tetracycline-regulated promoter
(a gift from Prof. Bernard Ducommun, Université Paul Sabatier) in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, G418 (100 Ag/mL), 1% penicillin-streptomycin,
and 2 Ag/mL tetracycline. Etoposide, cisplatin, and bleomycin were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO). Caffeine, nocodazole,
MG132, and tetracycline were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).
Cells were plated and incubated for 24 h at 25% to 30% density before UV or
compounds exposure (Stratagene, UVC Cross linker, La Jolla CA).
Antibodies and western blotting. Cdc25B was detected with
a monoclonal antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington,
KY). Antibodies for p53, Chk1 (Ser345), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Cdc25A,
Cdc25C, and Chk1 were detected with antibodies from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-histone H3 antibody was
purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), anti-HA antibody
from Covance (Berkeley, CA), and h-tubulin antibody from Cedarlane
Laboratories (Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Bound primary antibodies were
detected with either horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–goat anti-mouse
antibody or HRP-goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch,
West Grove, PA), and proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using
the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). Cell were harvested and lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.6), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L Na3VO4, 12 mmol/L
h-glycerol phosphate, 10 mmol/L NaF, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL
leupeptin, 100 Ag/mL 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, 10 Ag/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride], incubated on ice for 30 min with brief vortex mixing every
10 min, and centrifuged at 13,000  g for 15 min to clear the lysates.
Western blotting was done as described (12) with the exception that
proteins were transferred overnight to a nitrocellulose membrane at 30 V to
allow maximum protein transfer.
RNA interference and RNA measurements. The vector for creating
Cdc25B knockdown HCT116 cells was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX;
pSilencer 4.1 containing a gene for puromycin resistance). Oligonucleotides
encoding short hairpin RNA interference (shRNAi) targeting Cdc25B (target
sequence for Cdc25B4 vector AAAGGCGGCTACAAGGAGTTC or Cdc25B3
vector GTTCAGCAACATCGTGGATAA) were ligated into the vector
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Vector expressing interference
RNA with limited homology to any known sequence (scramble vector) was
provided by the manufacturer and used as a negative control. The pSilencer
plasmid was transfected in HCT116 using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and 24 h after
transfection, cells were replated and allowed to attach overnight. Thereafter,
clones were selected with 0.5 Ag/mL puromycin. Clones were picked
2 weeks later, expanded by culturing in the presence of 0.5 Ag/mL
puromycin, and screened for Cdc25B knockdown using Western blotting.
For Cdc25B smartpool small interfering RNA (siRNA; Dharmacon, Inc.,
Lafayette, CO) transfection, HCT116 cells were plated and incubated for
24 h to yield 50% to 55% density. Cells were transfected according to
manufacturer’s recommendation (Invitrogen). Briefly, 100 nmol/L of Cdc25B
smartpool siRNA was transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000, and 24 h later
cells were split to yield 30% to 35% density the next day when harvested.
Reverse transcription–PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells using
RNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized from 2 Ag of RNA
using random hexamer (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom)
with Superscript RNase H reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.,
Gaithersburg, MD). The reverse-transcribed cDNA from each sample was
subjected to PCR amplification using Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison,
WI) and primers. The sequence of the primers used was as described

previously (12). The PCR conditions for the amplification of Cdc25B and
b-actin genes were 24 cycles at 94jC for 30 s, 55jC for 30 s, and 72jC for
1 min, followed by a final incubation at 72jC for 7 min. Amplified products
were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and bands were
visualized by staining with ethidium bromide.
G2 checkpoint recovery assay and flow cytometry. For G2 checkpoint
recovery assay, we plated U2OS cells for 24 h and induced Cdc25B by
thoroughly washing cells and culturing in the absence of tetracycline for
16 h. After the 16-h induction, cells were mock or UV treated (as indicated)
and cells were either harvested at the indicated time points (asynchronous
cells) or were trapped in mitosis with a 23-h nocodazole (1 Amol/L)
incubation. For HCT116 Scr and Cdc25B4#2 cells, cells were plated for
24 h and were either mock or UV treated (as indicated). Cycling cells were
then trapped in mitosis with an 18-h nocodazole (1 Amol/L) incubation.
Identification of mitotic cells was carried out by simultaneously staining
cells with propidium iodide (PI) and phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) as
described previously (34). Briefly, cells were fixed overnight in 70% ethanol
and permeabilized with PBS, 0.25% Triton X100 for 8 min on ice. After
washing in PBS–1% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with 1 Ag
of anti–phospho-histone H3 for 2 h. Cells were again washed before
incubating with antirabbit IgG Alexa 488 (1:75 for U20S and 1:100 for
HCT116 cells) for 40 min in the dark. After cell washing and resuspension in
500 AL PI for 15 min, 20,000 cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting and WinMDI to determine phospho-histone H3 positive cells.

Results
Cdc25B induction by DNA damage. After an extensive
investigation of commercially available Cdc25B antibodies to
detect endogenous Cdc25B, we determined that an anti-Cdc25B
monoclonal antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories was
most specific. As shown in the Fig. 1A, this Cdc25B monoclonal
antibody detected two bands in the lysates of wild-type Cdc25B
MEFs in a region of the predicted molecular mass (f65 kDa) of
Cdc25B, whereas in the Cdc25B null MEF lysates only the lower
band was detected even after loading more lysate (Fig. 1A, lane 3).
These results confirmed that the upper band was Cdc25B. Other
commercially available antibodies to Cdc25B cross-reacted with
many additional bands and were unaffected in the MEFs lacking
Cdc25B or after shRNAi (data not shown). With the BD
Transduction antibody, the Cdc25B band ran closer to the
recombinant His-tagged human Cdc25B2 protein, further supporting that the upper band was indeed Cdc25B. This was further
corroborated by a decreased expression of Cdc25B in the clones
picked after Cdc25B-specific shRNAi treatment (Fig. 1B). Similar
results were obtained when we used Cdc25B smartpool (Dharmacon) in transient transfection assays (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Notably, Cdc25B specific shRNAi/siRNA did not decrease the levels
of the nonspecific lower band.
Thus, for all subsequent experiments, we used the BD
Transduction monoclonal antibody to detect endogenous Cdc25B
in cells. To investigate the effects of DNA-damaging agents on
endogenous Cdc25B expression, we treated asynchronous A549
cells with different clinically used anticancer drugs: topoisomerase
II poison etoposide (30 Amol/L), DNA cross-linker cisplatin
(25 Amol/L), and radiomimetic bleomycin (25 Amol/L) for 0, 1, 4,
and 24 h (Fig. 1B). These drug concentrations were based on
previous published findings revealing significant DNA damage
(35, 36). Unexpectedly, all of these agents increased cellular
Cdc25B protein levels within 1 h (Fig. 1B). With etoposide
treatment, Cdc25B was elevated for at least 24 h, whereas, with
cisplatin and bleomycin treatment, the increase in Cdc25B was
more transient and basal levels were seen at 24 h. Treatment with

as indicated by using isogenic HCT116 cells that expressed or
lacked p53 (Fig. 2B). We also studied the effect of UV on Cdc25B
wild-type and null MEFs. Cdc25B expression was increased in the
Cdc25B wild-type MEFs, whereas no Cdc25B was detected in
Cdc25B null cells as expected (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, Cdc25B
induction was attenuated in cells stably expressing Cdc25B shRNAi
(Cdc25B4#2) compared with cells with scrambled shRNAi (Fig. 2C).
Finally, to study the effect of UV irradiation on overexpressed
Cdc25B, we treated U20S cells expressing a tetracycline-regulated
HA-tagged Cdc25B. After removal of tetracycline from the medium,
HA-Cdc25B expression was induced and cells were either mock
or UV treated. Cells treated with UV expressed more HA-Cdc25B
at 24 h and 48 h compared with the mock-treated cells. Induction
of exogenous Cdc25B was confirmed using an antibody to the
HA-epitope tag (Fig. 2C).
We next determined the minimum dose of UV required to
increase endogenous Cdc25B expression. In A549 cells, doses as

anticancer drugs did not affect the levels of the lower band (data
not shown). As expected, treatment with these drugs decreased
Cdc25A and transcriptionally increased p53 levels, although the
kinetics for p53 induction was slower than that for Cdc25B. Additionally, Cdc25B levels increased within 1 h after treatment with
10 Gy of ionizing irradiation, a prototypical DNA-damaging agent,
with levels remaining high for at least 4 h (Fig. 1B). The kinetics
of Cdc25B increase after ionizing irradiation was similar to that
of p53. Therefore, Cdc25B induction was a promiscuous response
shared by mechanistically distinct DNA-damaging agents, and this
observation supports our previous finding that the DNA-damaging
carcinogen, benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide, increases Cdc25B expression in these lung cancer cells.
p53 independence of Cdc25B induction by UV. We next
examined the effect of DNA damage by UV irradiation on Cdc25B
expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, A549 cells treated with UV
(60 J/m2) had increased Cdc25B protein levels within 30 min after
irradiation and the levels were persistently increased for 24 h
posttreatment. Because of a previous report (22) showing that
Cdc25B levels were unaffected in HeLa cells exposed to UV, we
examined the effect of UV irradiation on endogenous Cdc25B
expression in HeLa cells to exclude cell type–specific effects. We
observed increased Cdc25B levels within 30 min after UV exposure,
which remained elevated for at least 24 h, similar to A549 cells
(Fig. 2A). Furthermore, Cdc25B induction was independent of p53,

cells were harvested at different time points for determination of endogenous

D, A549 cells were treated with different doses of UV, and 1 h later cells were
harvested. We plated 800 HCT116 (p53+/+) cells in 6-cm dish, and 24 h later cells
were treated with different doses of UV. The surviving clones were harvested
8 d posttreatment for Cdc25B expression. Levels of indicated proteins were

low as 15 J/m2 were sufficient to induce Cdc25B within 1 h
(Fig. 2D). To examine the effect of UV treatment on endogenous
Cdc25B expression in a long-term assay, we treated HCT116
(p53+/+) cells with UV doses ranging from 5 to 60 J/m2 and
harvested clones 8 days later. In this assay, doses at z5 J/m2
induced significant levels of Cdc25B (Fig. 2D). The effect of doses
>15 J/m2 could not be evaluated due to toxicity and lack of
sufficient colonies for analysis. These results support previous
findings, demonstrating an increase in Cdc25B levels after chronic
exposure to ionizing radiation (37).
Checkpoint regulates Cdc25B induction. Checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage results in the Chk1-dependent
phosphorylation of Cdc25A and Cdc25C (15, 18, 21). Because
Cdc25B has canonical Chk1/Chk2 phosphorylation sites and Chk1
has been shown to phosphorylate Cdc25B (38, 39), it is reasonable
to hypothesize that Cdc25B induction might be checkpointregulated. Indeed, Chk1 was rapidly phosphorylated and activated
in HCT116 cells after UV treatment (Fig. 3A). To investigate the role
of ATR/Chk1 pathway, we pretreated cells with caffeine (5 mmol/L)
to block ATR/ATM activation for 30 min before mock or UV
(60 J/m2) irradiation. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, pretreatment with
caffeine blocked the increase in Cdc25B seen 1 h after UV exposure.
Similar results were also observed in A549 cells (data not shown).
To determine the role of Chk1 in Cdc25B up-regulation, we
pretreated cells with UCN-01 (300 nmol/L) for 30 min and measured
Cdc25B levels 1 h after mock or UV treatment (60 J/m2). UCN-01
blocked the increase in Cdc25B expression with UV (Fig. 3B).
UCN-01 prevented loss of Cdc25A after UV (Supplementary Fig. S2),
confirming the efficacy of UCN-01 in inhibiting Chk1 activity. These
results also highlight the mechanistically distinct regulation of
Cdc25A and Cdc25B isoforms by checkpoint signaling after DNA
damage. We also examined Cdc25B induction in HCT116 Chk2 /
cells. Cells were either mock or UV (60 J/m2) treated and harvested
1 h later. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3, the increase in Cdc25B
level was independent of Chk2. We also noted similar Cdc25B
mRNA levels 4 h after UV treatment using semiquantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4). The labile nature of
Cdc25B was confirmed by MG132-mediated proteasomal inhibition,
which revealed increased Cdc25B levels by 24 h (Supplementary
Fig. S4C). These results support previous findings, showing
proteasome-mediated degradation of Cdc25B (40). Collectively,
our results support a model that the increase in Cdc25B protein
levels after UV is regulated by ATR/Chk1 pathway via posttranscriptional mechanism, potentially by affecting Cdc25B protein
stability.
Cdc25B regulates mitotic entry after DNA damage. Recent
evidence suggests that Cdc25B, but not Cdc25A or Cdc25C,
regulates cell cycle reentry after DNA damage produced by
doxorubicin (28). Stimulated by our observation that Cdc25B
expression was increased within 1 h in cells after exposure to
mechanistically distinct DNA-damaging agents, we hypothesized
that levels of Cdc25B might be crucial in regulating the rate of cell
cycle resumption after DNA damage–induced cell cycle arrest.
Thus, asynchronous cells were treated with mock or UV irradiation,
and cells exiting G2 were trapped in mitosis with nocodazole
(1 Amol/L) treatment for 18 h (HCT116) or 23 h (U2OS). Mitotic
arrest was detected either by probing lysates with a phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) antibody or by staining cells with PI and
phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) and analyzing cells with a flow
cytometer. To examine the effect of Cdc25B in this assay, we
reduced intracellular Cdc25B levels by >75% using shRNAi (Fig. 4A).

A, HCT116 cells were pretreated with vehicle or caffeine (5 mmol/L) for 30 min

with UCN-01 (300 nmol/L) for 30 min or vehicle before UV (60 J/m2) or mock
irradiation for 1 h. Representative of n = 4.

In the absence of DNA damage, 69.2 F 2.8% of control cells (Scr;
n = 3) and 59.4 F 4.0% of Cdc25B depleted cells (n = 3) were
trapped in mitosis (Fig. 4B and C), consistent with previous studies
suggesting Cdc25B is not required for normal cell cycle progression
(41). After 30 J/m2 UV, we observed a slight decrease in percentage
of cells trapped in mitosis by nocodazole for control cells (60.3 F
0.5%; n = 4), whereas only 40.5 F 1.1% of Cdc25B depleted cells
(n = 4) were arrested in mitosis. The difference in mitotic trapping
was even more pronounced at a higher dose of UV (60 J/m2), in
which 25.0 F 1.1% of control cells (n = 5) and 14.7 F 0.6% of
Cdc25B depleted cells (n = 5) were trapped in mitosis. At both
doses of UV, the difference between Scr and Cdc25B depleted cells
was statistically significant (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, with all of the
conditions, f80% of the cell population was in G2-M (Fig. 4D),
suggesting that, even after DNA damage, a majority of cells could
progress from G1 and S phase into G2 phase but entry into mitosis
was dependent on levels of Cdc25B and was directly correlated to
the intensity of DNA damage. These results were confirmed using
different shRNAi against Cdc25B (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that this was not due simply to an off-target effect of a single
shRNAi.
To understand how increased levels of Cdc25B affected cellular
progression after DNA damage, we exploited a previously described
tetracycline-regulated U2OS cell system (33). Ectopic HA-Cdc25B
expression was induced before treatment with either mock or UV
irradiation (Fig. 5A). In the absence of DNA damage, 73.5 F 1.4% of
control cells (+tet) were trapped in mitosis by nocodazole, which
was similar to Cdc25B overexpressing ( tet) cells (69.4 F 1.1%;
Fig. 5B and C). In the presence of DNA damage (UV at 30 J/m2),
however, 4.1 F 0.3% of UV exposed control (+tet) cells and 8.1 F
0.5% of UV exposed Cdc25B overexpressing ( tet) cells were
trapped in mitosis by nocodazole (Fig. 5B–D). In our experiments,

U20S cells were more sensitive to the toxic effects of UV compared
with HCT116 cells (data not shown). Also, HCT116 cells are
deficient in the mismatch repair protein hMLH1, which impairs
their ability to arrest in G2-M for prolonged period after DNA
damage (42).
Finally, if Cdc25B were important in the regulation of cell cycle
resumption, then cells expressing more Cdc25B should exit the
G2-M checkpoint earlier than control cells. To test this hypothesis,
we induced Cdc25B for 16 h by removing tetracycline and treated
asynchronous cells with either mock or UV irradiation (15 J/m2). At
2, 4, and 8 h of posttreatment, phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) staining
decreased indicative of a loss of the mitotic population and the
engagement of a G2-M checkpoint, which was independent of
Cdc25B levels (Supplementary Fig. S6). In contrast, at 12 and 24 h,
Cdc25B overexpressing cells ( tet) recovered from G2-M checkpoint, whereas in control cells (+tet), the G2-M checkpoint was still
enforced. Similar results were observed by examining phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) using flow cytometry (Fig. 6A). Four hours after
UV treatment, control and Cdc25B-overexpressing cells had fewer
mitotic cells compared with the corresponding mock-treated cells
consistent with the activation of the G2-M checkpoint. When

normalized to unirradiated controls, 0.36 F 0.01% of control
cells and 0.34 F 0.02% of Cdc25B-overexpressing cells were in
mitosis (Fig. 6B). At 12 h posttreatment, the G2-M checkpoint was
still enforced in control cells (0.22 F 0.01%) whereas Cdc25Boverexpressing cells resumed cell cycle followed by an increase in
the percentage of the population in mitosis (0.86 F 0.06%; Fig. 6A
and B). Collectively, these results show that Cdc25B had a
fundamental role in cells progression into mitosis after DNA
damage and checkpoint exit.

Discussion
It is well documented that Cdc25s are targeted in response to
DNA damage but the exact contributions of the three mammalian
Cdc25 homologues toward the resumption of cell cycle progression
are not completely understood. Interestingly, Cdc25A stabilization
does not seem to be sufficient to overcome ionizing or UV
irradiation–induced S phase checkpoints (16). In addition, Cdc25C
knockout cells have normal G2-M checkpoint response (43). These
findings indicate additional regulators cooperate to regulate cell
cycle progression after DNA damage. In this report, we describe a

previously unrecognized elevation in endogenous Cdc25B after
DNA damage generated by diverse types of genotoxic insults. We
propose that elevation in Cdc25B is an anticipatory response to
resume cell cycle after DNA damage–induced cell cycle arrest.
Our results are in contrast with one report (22), in which no
increase in Cdc25B levels were observed 1 to 2 h after UV (20 J/m2)
irradiation. One potential explanation for the differences in the
experimental results could be the reagents used to detect endogenous Cdc25B. The nature and specificity of the antibody used in
those experiments are not clear. At the time of the previous publication, Cdc25B null cells and Cdc25B shRNAi were unavailable. We
have observed that several commercially available antibodies are
useful when Cdc25B is overexpressed but fail to detect endogenous
Cdc25B (data not shown). Other possible explanation could be the
difference in the response of splice variants to DNA damage. There
are five splice variants of Cdc25B (44), and it is possible that Bulavin
et al. (22) were detecting a splice variant which was not regulated in
response to DNA damage. This seem unlikely, however, as the
monoclonal antibody used in our assay should detect all the splice
variants. Nonetheless, this warrants further analysis.
The biochemical factors that regulate cell cycle resumption after
DNA damage are still being defined. Interestingly, at least some
factors that participate in the canonical checkpoint response
seem to also regulate cell cycle resumption. Thus, Plk1, a wellcharacterized checkpoint target, is inhibited in response to DNA
damage by ATM/ATR to induce cell cycle arrest (45, 46). Plk1 also
regulates cell cycle resumption after DNA damage–induced cell
cycle arrest (28). We now show that Cdc25B, which can be inhibited
by p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2

phosphorylation at Ser309 after DNA damage (47), was rapidly
induced after DNA damage and propose that this helps regulate
cell cycle resumption. One could envisage that Cdc25B phosphorylation at Ser309 is operative only in the G2 cell population to
prevent premature entry into mitosis in the presence of DNA
damage. The decrease in mitotic cells at 4 h after UV, which was
independent of Cdc25B expression (Fig. 6), could be due to the lack
of dephosphorylation of Cdc25B Ser309, which is important for
progression through mitosis (48, 49). A key issue that needs to be
resolved, however, is how opposing functions are orchestrated in
an orderly manner to allow cells to recover from the effects of
DNA-damaging agents without compromising genomic integrity.
One possible explanation is that in the period immediately after
DNA damage, checkpoints regulating cell cycle arrest are more
active, thus allowing time for DNA repair. This would be in
agreement with our data showing that cells overexpressing Cdc25B
were arrested normally after DNA damage. Nonetheless, they
resumed cell cycle progression significantly earlier than control
cells (Fig. 6). As described previously (17, 20), degradation of
Cdc25A is a key event in arresting cells in G2 after DNA damage,
whereas our data suggest that accumulation of Cdc25B regulates
cell cycle resumption. Based on this, we proposed that initial cell
cycle arrest after DNA damage might be more dependent on the
loss of Cdc25A, whereas Cdc25B accumulation regulates cell cycle
resumption. This could explain the absence of checkpoint defects
in Cdc25BC double knockouts immediately after exposure to
ionizing radiation (41). Cell cycle reentry after UV irradiation was
not formally studied in this background. Although a rapid increase
in Cdc25B expression would seem premature for its role in cell

cycle resumption, temporally the Chk1 activity begins to decline 1
h after UV, which we have confirmed by examining Chk1 (Ser345)
phosphorylation (activating phosphorylation) after UV (data not
shown). These findings suggest a testable hypothesis that
increased Cdc25B is a cellular priming factor for cell cycle
resumption once DNA damage repair is complete and the ATR/
Chk1 pathway prepares the cells for cell cycle resumption before
inactivation of checkpoint signaling. Alternatively, gradual accumulation of Cdc25B after DNA damage may also be required to
increase Cdk1 activity to a level that would be sufficient to
overcome the inhibition accumulated during the DNA damage–
induced cell cycle arrest. The dependence on increased Cdc25B
levels as a limiting factor only after DNA damage was supported
by our result that overexpression of Cdc25B did not significantly
increase the number of cells in mitosis in the absence of DNA
damage (Fig. 5).
Van Vugt et al. (28) previously found Cdc25B and Plk1 were
not required for recovery for DNA damage in Wee1 depleted cells.
Cdk1 regulates Wee1 degradation at the onset of mitosis (50).
Functionally, one attractive hypothesis for how elevated Cdc25B
might regulate cell cycle reentry after DNA damage could be by
promoting Wee1 degradation through activation of Cdk1, thus
ensuring sustained activation of Cdk1.
The important role Cdc25B plays in regulating cell cycle
resumption could also help explain the oncogenic properties of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

this phosphatase. It is possible that overexpression of Cdc25B in
tumor cells overwhelms the process of cell cycle resumption and
survival, resulting in division of cells with damaged DNA, thereby
contributing to genomic instability observed in cancer cells. This
could explain the increased susceptibility to breast cancer
induction by 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene in mice that
ectopically overexpressed Cdc25B in mammary glands (11).
Finally, our results reinforce the attractive nature of Cdc25B
inhibition as an adjuvant approach for anticancer therapy because
inhibition of Cdc25B by small molecule inhibitor might impair
checkpoint recovery and increase the efficacy of DNA-damaging
agents.
