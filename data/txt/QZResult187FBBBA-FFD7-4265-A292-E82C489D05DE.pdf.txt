BACKGROUND: Irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimens are 1 option for treatment of metastatic colorectal
cancer (mCRC). The authors report the safety and efficacy of such regimens in elderly patients using a large
phase III trial (bolus, infusional, or capecitabine with camptostar-celecoxib [BICC-C]) cohort. METHODS: In
period 1, 430 previously untreated patients with mCRC were randomized in a 3-by-2 design to receive irinotecan plus infusional 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRI), irinotecan plus bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (mIFL), and irinotecan plus oral capecitabine (CapeIRI). In period 2, an additional 117 patients were
randomized to receive FOLFIRI or mIFL and bevacizumab. In both periods patients were also randomized
to a double-blind treatment with celecoxib or placebo. A secondary analysis was conducted examining the
safety and efficacy of these regimens in elderly (age >70 years) versus nonelderly (age 70 years)
patients. RESULTS: In period 1, 19.5% of patients were elderly, compared with 24.8% in period 2. Rates of
grade 3 and higher toxicity did not differ significantly between age groups in either period by treatment
arm, with the exception of asthenia in the FOLFIRI and CapeIRI arms (P ¼.05 and P ¼.03, respectively) and
dehydration in the CapeIRI arm in period 1 (P ¼.02). Overall progression-free survival for FOLFIRI in both
periods was not statistically different by age. Objective responses and overall survival did not differ by
patient age within treatment arms and periods. CONCLUSIONS: Irinotecan/fluoropyrimidine combinations
are well tolerated in the elderly population, with similar efficacy to that found in nonelderly patients in firstC 2009 American Cancer Society.

Original Article

An estimated 153,000 persons were diagnosed with colorectal cancer and more than 50,000 died from colorectal
cancer (CRC) in the United States in 2007.1 Worldwide,
over 1 million individuals are diagnosed with CRC and
just over 500,000 die from CRC annually.1,2 Elderly individuals are a rapidly growing segment of the US population. In fact, individuals aged 70 years and over will
comprise 18% of the United States population by the year
2030.3 They are disproportionately affected by colorectal
cancer. By 2025, approximately 75% of new cases and
85% of cancer deaths from colorectal cancer will occur in
patients older than 65 years.4 The median ages at colorectal cancer diagnosis and death are 71 and 75 years, respectively.1 In the United States, the expected median life
expectancy1 for a 70- to 75-year-old without metastatic
cancer ranges from 9 to 16 years for men, and from 9 to
12 years for women.5 Unfortunately, there is a paucity of
information concerning the factors that modify treatment
effect, tolerance, and toxicity of elderly patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. Given the increasing number
of older patients with colorectal cancer, and their expected
life expectancy, identifying safe and efficacious therapies
for elderly patients is imperative.
The treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer has
changed rapidly in the past 10 years, with combination
chemotherapy being standard first-line treatment for
most patients. Although more aggressive therapy regimens
have increased median overall survival, they have also
increased the likelihood of side effects from treatment.6
There is a growing body of literature suggesting similar
safety and efficacy of combination regimens for elderly
patients with mCRC compared with nonelderly
patients.7-16 However, the bulk of this literature is limited
to oxaliplatin-based therapy. As irinotecan-based regimens appear to have similar efficacy overall compared
with oxaliplatin-based regimens when the fluoropyrimidine backbone is similar,17-23 we sought to test if efficacy
and safety differed by age for irinotecan-based regimens.
The bolus, infusional, or capecitabine with camptostar-celecoxib (BICC-C) study was a large, multicenter,
randomized phase III trial in previously untreated patients
with metastatic colorectal cancer, comparing combination
regimens of irinotecan and various fluoropyrimidine
strategies.24 From that cohort, we now report on the safety
and efficacy of irinotecan-based chemotherapy in first-line
2618

metastatic colorectal cancer patients aged >70 years (elderly) compared with those aged 70 years (nonelderly).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Selection
The BICC-C study was initiated in 2003 in previously
untreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Full
details of inclusion and exclusion criteria have been
recently reported.24 Briefly, patients had histologically
confirmed, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or
rectum with measurable disease; were 18 years old; had
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 to 1; and had adequate bone marrow,
hepatic, and renal function. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy
must have been completed at least 12 months before
inclusion; any major surgery must have been completed
4 weeks before the first bevacizumab dose. Exclusion
criteria included inadequately controlled hypertension, serious cardiovascular disease, Gilbert disease, active use of
cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or chronic use of >325 mg/d of aspirin.
Chemotherapy Regimens
and Randomization
Patients were randomized to 1 of the 3 open-label chemotherapy arms: infusional 5-flourouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI); bolus 5-FU, leucovorin,
and irinotecan (mIFL); or oral capecitabine with irinotecan (CapeIRI), as well as to a double-blind treatment celecoxib or placebo (period 1) using a 3-by-2 factorial design
(Fig. 1). In April 2004, after US Food and Drug Administration approval of bevacizumab, the trial was amended to
compare FOLFIRI and bevacizumab (FOLFIRI þ Bev)
with mIFL and bevacizumab (mIFL þ Bev) using a 2-by2 factorial design (period 2); the CapeIRI arm was discontinued because of greater toxicity and limited safety data
for the addition of bevacizumab to this arm (Fig. 1). Following the amendment, patients randomized to FOLFIRI
or mIFL during period 1 who were still on study had the
option of adding bevacizumab to their current regimen;
16 patients on the FOLFIRI arm and 7 patients on the
mIFL arm added bevacizumab to their regimen. For the
treatment trial, predefined stratification factors for randomization were age (70 or >70 years old), ECOG PS

(0 or 1), and low-dose aspirin use (325 mg daily; yes or
no); thus, there was balanced distribution by age to the
treatment arms.
Patients were treated with chemotherapy (in conjunction with twice daily celecoxib or placebo) until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicities caused by
chemotherapy, or withdrawal of patient consent. Celecoxib or placebo administration for all patients remaining
on study was permanently discontinued on January 19,
2005 after an announcement of the potential association
of celecoxib with increased risk of major cardiovascular
events in a long-term, colorectal adenoma prevention
study (the adenoma prevention with celecoxib [APC]
trial).25 Starting doses of all therapy were the same regardless of the age of the patient. Standard intra- and interCancer

cycle dose modifications for 5-FU, capecitabine, and
irinotecan (based on the package insert for irinotecan26)
were prescribed if grade 2 to 4 toxicities occurred (based
on National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria,
version 2.0). Leucovorin, bevacizumab, and celecoxib
doses were not altered.
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution.
Each patient provided written informed consent. The
study was sponsored by Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals.
Study Assessments
Baseline evaluation of patients before randomization and
throughout the study has been recently reported.24 Baseline radiographic tumor assessments were performed
2619

Original Article

within 21 days before the first study medication dose.
During chemotherapy, follow-up radiology assessments
were to be performed every 6 weeks until PD or on chemotherapy discontinuation. For the purpose of this study,
PD was defined as any of the following criteria having
been met: definition of PD based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines,
investigator’s clinical judgment of PD, or death by any
cause in the absence of previously documented PD. If a
patient’s disease was in response or stable at the time of
treatment withdrawal, the patient was followed every 6
weeks until PD. After PD, the patient was followed every
3 months for survival. Tumor response classification was
based on RECIST guidelines.27

Statistical Considerations
In this secondary analysis of the data, we defined elderly as
aged >70 years old at the time of randomization onto the
treatment trial. Thus, 2 subgroups were designated: aged
<70 years (nonelderly) and aged >70 years (elderly). The
primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival
(PFS), defined as the time from randomization to the first
documentation of PD. For patients without documented
PD, data were censored on the date of the last tumor
assessment with nonprogression status, or, for patients
who started a second-line therapy, at the date of the start
of the new therapy. The primary efficacy analysis for this
analysis compared PFS by age category for each study period. Secondary efficacy analyses included PFS, response
rate, and overall survival within each treatment arm by age
and by period. Overall survival was defined as the time
from the date of randomization to the date of death; in
the absence of confirmation of death, data were censored
at the last date the patient was known to be alive.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate PFS
and overall survival24; differences by age categories were
tested by the log-rank test. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95%
confidence interval (CI) for age comparisons were obtained
from a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for
ECOG performance status, low-dose aspirin use at randomization, and randomization to celecoxib treatment.28
All statistical tests were 2-sided, using a significance level of
5%. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.
Efficacy analyses included all patients randomized
on an intent-to-treat basis. Safety analyses included all

treated patients and were summarized descriptively. All
efficacy and safety analyses reported were performed using
a data collection cutoff date of November 15, 2007.

RESULTS
Patient Enrollment and Characteristics
During period 1 (February 2003 through March 2004),
430 patients were randomized to FOLFIRI, mIFL, or
CapeIRI. Of these patients, 346 were aged 70 years, and
84 were aged >70 years (Fig. 2). During period 2 (April
2004 through December 2004), 117 patients were
randomized to FOLFIRI/Bev or mIFL/Bev. Of these
patients, 88 were aged 70 years, and 29 were aged >70
years. Baseline characteristics were fairly well balanced by
age (Table 1). There are no statistically significant differences in the duration of treatment across age groups for either period 1 (P ¼ .33) or period 2 (P ¼ .69).

within each age group, there was a trend toward a superior
PFS for patients treated with FOLFIRI when compared
with either mIFL or CapeIRI. Median PFS was similar for
those who received FOLFIRI regardless of age category
(7.9 months for age 70 years, 7.5 months for age >70
years; HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.69-1.76). In addition, no significant differences in median PFS were noted between
age groups for mIFL (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.51-1.32) or
CapeIRI (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.59-1.64).

Objective response, as defined by RECIST criteria,
did not differ significantly by age by treatment arm. In the
FOLFIRI arm, nearly half of subjects aged 70 years
(47%) had a response, compared with 50% of those aged
>70 years. Rates of response were lower in the other treatment arms, but similar between the 2 age groups.

4.1 month longer median OS time in the FOLFIRI arm,
this difference was not statistically significant compared
with those aged >70 years (Table 5).
Period 2

Only 29 of 117 patients were aged >70 in period 2;
thus, statistical power was more limited. PFS did not differ significantly between age groups in all treatments combined once bevacizumab was added to FOLFIRI or mIFL
during a median 23-month follow-up period (Fig. 3).
Patients aged 70 years experienced a 3-month increase
in median PFS compared with older patients (10.6 compared with 7.6 months, P ¼ .14) (Table 4). As with period
1, response rate did not differ by age group between treatment arms (FOLFIRI/Bev: 58% age 70 years, 57% age
>70 years; mIFL/Bev: 58% age 70 years, 40% age >70
years). Similarly, OS did not differ significantly between
the 2 age groups for the overall cohort or within each
treatment arm (Table 5, Fig. 3). Consistent with the overall results of the trial,24 within each age group, there was a
trend toward a superior PFS and OS for patients treated
with FOLFIRI/Bev when compared with mIFL/Bev.

DISCUSSION
In this secondary analysis of the BICC-C trial, elderly
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer generally tolerated irinotecan and fluoropyrimidine combination regimens similarly to nonelderly patients, with the exception
of modest increases in rates of neutropenia and asthenia.
Furthermore, elderly patients derived similar benefit from
combination therapy, with no significant differences in
PFS and OS compared with nonelderly patients.
Irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, is an active
drug in metastatic colorectal cancer that is converted by
the liver into 2 active metabolites, SN-38 and SN-38 glucuronide. Irinotecan monotherapy has been shown to be
well tolerated in the general metastatic colorectal cancer
population, inclusive of the elderly.29-31 Although plasma
levels of its active metabolites may predict for toxicity,
pharmacokinetic studies have revealed no significant differences in the plasma levels of these irinotecan metabolites in older and younger patients.32 Thus, the
pharmacological properties of the drug would suggest a

similar expected safety and efficacy profile in the elderly
and nonelderly.
Our findings are congruent with the existing literature regarding irinotecan in elderly metastatic colorectal
cancer patients. In a subset analysis of a multi-institutional
phase II study of weekly single agent irinotecan, Rothenberg and colleagues found increased rates of grade III/IV
diarrhea in patients aged 65 years or older compared with
those younger than 65 years (39% vs 19%, P < .0008),
although rates of first-course diarrhea were not statistically
different (25% vs 15%, P ¼ .1).33 In a trial comparing the
weekly and the triweekly dosing regimens of irinotecan
monotherapy as second-line therapy for metastatic disease, >1=3 of 291 patients were at least 70 years of age.31
Age >70 years did not affect survival or PFS, but was associated with an increased risk of grade III/IV neutropenia
and grade III/IV diarrhea compared with patients <70
years of age. In contrast, Chau and colleagues found that
elderly patients (at least 70 years old) who were treated on
a trial of irinotecan monotherapy every 3 weeks (starting
dose 350 mg/m2) had similar rates of grade III/IV toxicity
compared with nonelderly patients (46% vs 38%, P ¼ .2)
and derived similar rates of objective response and OS.29
In regard to combination irinotecan-based regimens, Folprecht and colleagues recently published a
pooled analysis of 599 patients aged 70 years who
received fluorouracil-based therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer, 220 of whom also received irinotecan.16 This
pooled analysis of 4 clinical trials noted similar tolerance
of irinotecan/fluoropyrimidine combinations between
older and younger subjects. With the exception of hepatic
toxicity, older and younger subjects experienced similar
rates of grade 3 and higher toxicity. PFS was increased by
1 month for older compared with younger subjects (9.2 vs
8.2 months, P ¼ .04), although OS and response rate did
not differ between age groups.
Mitry and colleagues recently reported interim
results in abstract form of a phase III trial of infusional 5FU and leucovorin or infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, and
irinotecan in elderly patients (at least 75 years old) with
metastatic colorectal cancer.34 The objective response rate
was higher for those who received irinotecan and infusional 5-FU therapy (31%) compared with those treated
with infusional 5-FU and leucovorin alone (18%). Rates
of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia were lower in that trial (28%)
compared with the BICC-C elderly population (54%),

although rates of diarrhea were similar between the 2 trials
(16% vs 11%).
The advantage of this analysis is that BICC-C was a
large, phase III trial that stratified by age with protocolspecified collection of efficacy and toxicity. Furthermore,
prior reports of irinotecan in the elderly have not
included bevacizumab-containing regimens.35 In this
analysis of the BICC-C trial, rates of dose reduction and
delay for elderly and nonelderly patients were similar.
This compares favorably to several studies.34,36-38 The
recently reported interim analysis reported by Mitry
demonstrated that 67% (for combination with bolus
FU) and 87% (for combination with continuous infusion FU) of patients at least 75 years old received 75%
planned irinotecan doses during cycles 1 through 4.34
These results suggest that maintaining dose intensity is
feasible in elderly patients.
Although our findings are supportive of aggressive
irinotecan-based combination treatment of elderly
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, there are limitations to our analyses. First, the use of a population eligible
for a clinical trial may limit generalizability to the entire
metastatic colorectal cancer population. The present study
is limited in representation of older patients in clinical trials. Only 20% (period 1) and 25% (period 2) of the study
population was aged 70 years, in contrast to 50% of the
population diagnosed with colorectal cancer annually in
the United States (median age of diagnosis, 71 years).1 In
addition to eligibility restrictions, disproportionately few
elderly patients are enrolled in clinical trials, and trial populations are generally not representative of the typical
older cancer patient.39-43 Possible methods to overcome
this barrier in clinical trial enrollment for older patients is
to 1) develop risk-stratified treatment protocols based on
comprehensive geriatric assessment, inclusive of assessment of functional status, comorbid conditions, and polypharmacy; 2) develop less restrictive inclusion criteria for
older patients to allow generalizability to the general cancer population; and 3) increase funding for additional
studies evaluating the impact of the biology of aging,
comorbid conditions, and social support of older cancer
patients on treatment outcomes.44-50 A final limitation of
the present analysis is that information on comorbidities
was not collected as part of study enrollment, and thus
adjustments for other concurrent medical problems was
not possible in these analyses.

In conclusion, within the context of this multicenter randomized clinical trial, patients aged >70 years
derive similar benefit from aggressive irinotecan-based
combination chemotherapy as younger patients, with
acceptable rates of toxicity. To continue developing
treatment strategies for the growing population of older
colorectal cancer patients, oncologists must continue to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel treatment regimens in this unique population. Increasing enrollment
of elderly patients in clinical trials is 1 way to accomplish this imperative and determine feasible treatment
strategies.
