BACKGROUND. Temozolomide (TMZ), an oral methylating imidazotetrazinone,
has antitumor activity against gliomas, malignant melanomas, and brain metastasis and is presently administered as a 5-day oral schedule every 4 weeks.

METHODS. A single-institution phase 2 clinical trial was conducted to determine
the efficacy and the safety profile of a new regimen based on a dose-intensified,
protracted course of TMZ after whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Patients were
eligible if they had at least 1 bidimensionally measurable brain metastasis from
breast cancer and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Twenty-seven patients
were treated with 30 grays (Gy) of WBRT with concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2/day)
for 10 days, and subsequent TMZ at a dose of 75 mg/m2 per day for 21 days
every 4 weeks, for up to 12 cycles.

RESULTS. Two complete responses (7.4%) and 11 partial responses (40.7%) were
achieved. The schedule appeared to be well tolerated, with grade 3 toxicity
(graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria)
observed in only 2 patients. The overall median survival was 8.8 months and the
median progression-free survival was 6 months.

CONCLUSIONS. The concomitant use of WBRT and protracted low-dose TMZ
appears to be an active, well-tolerated regimen. The observed antitumor activity
suggests the need for further investigation of this schedule in combination with
other anticancer agents for the concomitant treatment of brain metastases and
primary cancers. Cancer 2008;113:2524–31.  2008 American Cancer Society.

rain metastases (BMs) represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality for breast cancer and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The incidence of central nervous system
(CNS) metastases has been reported to be 15% to 25% in patients
with breast cancer and 30% to 40% in patients with NSCLC.1-3 BMs
continue to have a negative impact on quality of life and prognosis;
in fact, the median overall survival is <3 to 6 months.2,4 The current
standard of care for BM involves surgical resection, whole-brain
radiotherapy (WBRT), and control of symptoms with steroids and
anticonvulsants.1-6
Conversely, the role of chemotherapy in this setting of patients
remains controversial because penetration of the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) is a limiting factor for both chemotherapy and target-based
agents. Chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has emerged as a

possible alternative approach for patients with recurrent brain metastases. TMZ is an oral alkylating agent
that crosses the BBB, achieving effective concentrations in the CNS; moreover, it has demonstrated preclinical activity against several cancers.7,8
Previous studies have reported the use of singleagent TMZ in the setting of recurrent or progressive
BM, with modest results. The study of the Hellenic
Cooperative Group enrolled 27 patients with BM and
achieved a partial response (PR) rate of 4% using a
dose of 150 mg/m2 on Days 1 through 5 every 28
days.9 Abrey et al10 enrolled 41 patients in a phase 2
trial and obtained a disease control rate of 41% (PR
1 stable disease [SD]) with TMZ at a dose of 150 to
200 mg/m2 on Days 1 through 5 every 28 days.
Recently, 2 other phase 2 trials confirmed the lack of
efficacy of single-agent TMZ in patients with BM
from NSCLC and breast cancer, respectively.11,12
Conversely, the efficacy and safety of using TMZ
concurrently with WBRT was evaluated in 3 other
trials. Antonadou et al13 reported that WBRT plus
TMZ demonstrated a significant improvement in
response rate compared with WBRT alone (96% vs
67%), but that study evaluated only the response rate
and data regarding survival were lacking. In another
randomized trial, the authors demonstrated that the
concomitant treatment was well tolerated and
resulted in a significantly better progression-free
survival (PFS) for patients with BM.14
A recently reported trial performed at our institution demonstrated that concomitant treatment with
WBRT and TMZ (at a dose of 150 mg/m2/day for 5
days every 28 days) is well tolerated, achieving an
overall response rate of 44% and a disease control
rate of 76.3%. We demonstrated a positive impact of
this therapy on the quality of life (QoL) of patients
with BMs after 3 and 6 months from the initiation of
treatment with TMZ. QoL analysis demonstrated a
high level of satisfaction among patients who had
been treated with TMZ plus WBRT for BM, providing
excellent evidence for patient compliance.15
Myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity
when TMZ is administered on a 5-day schedule
repeated every 4 weeks16; therefore, to our knowledge
few chemotherapy trials to date have been performed based on the combination of TMZ and other
currently available agents. At our institution, a regimen based on the combination of TMZ and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was recently evaluated
in the treatment of BMs from solid tumors. This
schedule induced a promising clinical response rate,
with 3 complete responses (CRs) (15.8%) and 2 PRs
(10.5%) reported.17 Another combination of capecitabine and TMZ was investigated in a phase 1 study in

2525

which 24 breast cancer patients with either newly
diagnosed or recurrent BMs were enrolled; the
authors reported 1 CR and 3 PRs. Moreover, 50% of
patients had minor responses or SD.18
In the current study, we describe a new regimen
based on 30 grays (Gy) of WBRT administered with
concomitant TMZ (at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day) for
10 days followed by the administration of TMZ at a
dose of 75 mg/m2 per day for 21 days every 4 weeks,
for up to 12 cycles. This schedule was designed to
use an intensive and protracted (metronomic-like)
TMZ dosing schedule that could both induce the
described favorable effects of continuous TMZ
administration and allow the concomitant use of a
second cytotoxic agent for the primary tumor. To our
knowledge, this phase 2 trial represents the first
study of a protracted, single-agent TMZ schedule in
patients with BM from breast cancer and NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility Criteria
Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed
breast cancer and NSCLC and inoperable BMs were
eligible for the study. Patients were eligible if they
had at least 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion
measuring >20 mm in the largest dimension and
assessable by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (Gd-MRI). Patients were required
to age 18 years and to have a life expectancy of
>12 weeks and a Karnofsky performance score (KPS)
>60. Other eligibility criteria included adequate hematologic function with a platelet count >100,000/
mm2 and hemoglobin >8 g/dL, renal function with a
creatinine level 2 mg/dL, and adequate liver function with an aspartate aminotransferase level <1.5 3
the upper limit of normal. Prior adjuvant hormonal
therapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy as well as
prior regimens for metastatic disease were withdrawn at least 30 days prior to enrollment in the
study. Patients who had received prior treatment for
BMs, those with severe intercurrent medical illness
or symptomatic heart disease, or those who were
pregnant or lactating were ineligible. Eligible patients
were required to have fully recovered from previous
therapy. The Institutional Ethics Committee approved
the protocol and patients were required to provide
informed consent before beginning the treatment.
Treatment Schedule
Planned conventional WBRT was administered with a
daily dose of 3 Gy 3 5 days each week for 2 weeks
for a total dose of 30 Gy. Planned chemotherapy

treatment consisted of TMZ at a dose of 75 mg/m2
administered orally during radiotherapy, followed by
4 weeks off therapy and a subsequent TMZ administration at 75 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 21 every 4 weeks
for up to 12 additional cycles. Patients were treated
until evidence of progression of BMs.
Dexamethasone and opioids were administrated
at the lowest dose needed to preserve neurologic
stability. Anticonvulsant agents were only used in
patients with seizures.

Patient Evaluation
Pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical
history, physical examination, determination of KPS,
and hematologic and biochemistry evaluation within
7 days of registration. Evaluation during treatment
consisted of physical examinations on Day 1 of each
cycle; weekly blood counts were performed for Cycle
1 and on Days 1 and 15 thereafter. Biochemistry was
performed on Day 1 of each cycle. The initial examinations had to be performed within 30 days before
inclusion in the study. Target lesions were assessed by
CT or Gd-MRI. Evaluation of target lesions was performed every 3 cycles according to the World Health
Organization (WHO)/ Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) criteria15 as described below.
A CR required the disappearance of all known
brain metastases. A PR required a 50% decrease in
measurable brain lesions or an objective improvement in evaluable, but nonmeasurable brain lesions.
It was not necessary for every brain lesion to have
regressed, but no brain lesion should have progressed. SD indicated that brain lesions remained
unchanged (<50% decrease or <25% increase in the
size of measurable lesions). Progressive disease (PD)
indicated progression of some or all brain lesions
and/or the appearance of new brain lesions. No
brain lesion regressed.
Total body CT and/or other examinations if
needed were also repeated every 3 cycles for the evaluation of extracranial and systemic disease; all scans
were centrally reviewed by 2 blinded radiologists and
systemic disease was evaluated according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria.19 The patients who recorded a
systemic PD were censored in the study.
All adverse events were recorded and graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria. Neurologic functional status was
assessed by 2 examiners at baseline and every 3
cycles as described previously by Antonadou et al.13
In brief, the functional status was assessed by 2
examiners as Level I, fully functional; Level II, fully
functional, not able to work; Level III, stays in bed

and needs help half the time; and Level IV, requires
help all the time.

Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of the current study was to
assess the activity, measured as objective BM
response, to TMZ given orally on Days 1 to 21 every
4 weeks in 27 evaluable patients with measurable
BM from breast cancer and NSCLC. The secondary
objectives were to determine overall survival (OS),
PFS, and the toxic effects of TMZ when administered
in this fashion. Other objectives were assessement of
functional status and the amount of symptomatic
drug assumption. PFS was measured from the date
of registration to the date of documented PD or
death. OS was assessed from the time of registration
to the date of death resulting from any cause. PFS
and OS were both determined by the Kaplan-Meier
product limit method.20 A 2-stage Simon accrual
design was adopted for this phase 2 trial.21 The minimum target activity level was 20% and early discontinuation of the study was planned in case of no
response in the first 12 assessable patients.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Thirty-two patients with BM from either breast cancer or NSCLC were assessed for eligibility from November 2005 through December 2006. Three patients
did not meet the inclusion criteria, 1 patient refused
to participate, and 1 patient did not receive the first
treatment although he agreed to enter the study.
Clinical and demographic characteristics of the
remaining 27 patients are listed in Table 1. The average age was 55 years (range, 46-76 years) there were
14 women and 13 men, and 7 patients had KPS <70.
Among 27 assessable patients, 15 (55%) had NSCLC
and 12 (45%) had breast cancer; 20 had received
prior systemic chemotherapy, and 11 had received
previous radiotherapy (in extrabrain sites). All
patients had BM and 21 (78%) had 2 BM; 15
patients (55%) had at least 1 other metastatic site.
A total of 114 cycles were administered; the
median number of cycles administered was 4.2.
Clinical Activity
Global responses, evaluated every 3 cycles, are summarized in Table 2. Two CRs were achieved in
patients with BM from NSCLC and breast cancer,
respectively, and lasted 12 months. Both patients had
only BMs and underwent surgery for primary cancer.
Eleven PRs were recorded in 6 patients with breast
cancer and 5 with NSCLC; 6 of these patients

remained in PR for up to 6 cycles. Eight of 11
patients who obtained a PR had only BMs. Another 6
patients remained in SD for up to 3 cycles, 3 for up
to 6 cycles, and 8 patients demonstrated PD during
the treatment. Of these 8 patients 2 were in SD for
brain lesions and in PD for visceral sites of disease.
At the time of PD they stopped the administration of
low-dose TMZ and began a specific treatment for the
control of visceral disease. However, they also developed PD at brain sites after 1 month from the suspension of TMZ and the recalculation of time to
progression (TTP) of all the patients enrolled in the
study considering only PD in the brain gave a median TTP of 8.9 months (which was not significantly
different from the previous analysis).
Another 6 patients remained in SD for up to 3
cycles, 3 for up to 6 cycles, and 8 patients demonstrated PD during the treatment.
As shown in Table 2, the odds ratio (OR) was
48.1% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 38.7%56.9%), whereas the disease control rate (CR 1 PR 1
SD) was 70.3% (95% CI, 61.7%-82.4%). The overall
response rate was 58% (7 of 12 patients) in breast
cancer patients and 40% (6 of 15 patients) in NSCLC
patients. According to stratification by Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), which considers multiple prognostic factors, class I included 11 patients (41%),
class II included 10 patients (37%), and class III
included 6 patients (22%). Interestingly, in the RPA
Class I, 9 (82%) OR and 2 (8%) SD were obtained;
conversely, among the 6 patients (22%) included in
RPA Class III, no PR 1 CR was observed (Table 3).
The median TTP was 6 months (95% CI, 5.1-6.8
months) (Fig. 1A) and the median OS was 8.8
months (95% CI, 6.8-8.9 months) (Fig. 1B). The 1year survival rate was 18.5% (95% CI, 8.5-22.8%).

mon Toxicity Criteria recommendations for the grading of acute and subacute toxicity. TMZ was generally well tolerated and the main toxicities observed
were hematologic (Table 4). The toxicities were generally between grade 1 or 2 in severity, although 2
patients had grade 3 events with neutropenia and
anemia, respectively. The most common drug-related
nonhematologic toxicities were nausea in 9 patients
(37%), vomiting in 6 patients (25%), and headache in
5 patients (21%). No liver, renal, or cardiac toxicities
were observed in the current series. Treatment interruptions because of toxicity were not observed in our
series, and no patients required dose reductions.

Evaluation of Neurologic Function
Another measure of treatment efficacy was the assessment of neurologic function at baseline and after 3
and 6 cycles of treatment. The effects of treatment on
both neurologic function and BM size are listed in Table 5. After 3 cycles of treatment, the percentage of
patients in Level I (fully functional) and Level II (fully
functional but not able to work) increased from 75%
to 85%, whereas the number of patients with Level III
status decreased from 25% to 15%.
The efficacy of this treatment was confirmed by
the decreased requirement for medication to palliate

neurologic symptoms. At baseline, 15 (55%) patients
required corticosteroids, 7 (26%) required anticonvulsants, and 8 (29%) required opioids. After 2 months,
4 months, and 6 months of TMZ treatment, these
percentages progressively decreased. In fact, at 6
months, 7 (26%) patients required corticosteroids, 4
(15%) required anticonvulsants, and 3 (11%) required
opioids. These data confirm the clinical benefit given
by the schedule used in the current study in this
subset of patients.

DISCUSSION
Tumors most commonly metastasizing to brain
include those from the lung and breast. Although

Low-dose TMZ in Patients With Brain Metastases/Addeo et al

WBRT is still a standard and active treatment in the
management of BM, recent trials of TMZ and WBRT
suggest a significant increase in response rate, especially for metastases from lung cancer.22,23 Unfortunately, using standard schedules (150-200 mg/m2/day
for 5 days, every 28 days), TMZ produced a low
response rate at other visceral sites derived from either breast cancer or NSCLC.10,24 In a previous study,
we obtained a 45% overall response rate using a
schedule containing TMZ at a dose of 150 mg/m2 per
day for 5 days, with toxicities including grade 3 neutropenia (15%) and anemia (13%), even if it was safe
and tolerable.15 Conversely, the combination of TMZ
with other chemotherapy agents (ie, cisplatin)
induced a considerable toxicity (most likely because
of the addition of other cytotoxic drugs more than
because of TMZ itself).11 In another study, 18 patients
with NSCLC and BMs received aggressive treatment
with WBRT and chemotherapy with vinorelbine, ifosfamide, and cisplatin; they achieved an objective
brain response rate of 56%, but all patients reported
severe grade 4 neutropenia.25
The possibility of combining TMZ with other
agents is shown by the lowering of TMZ dosages that
can reduce the occurrence of its side effects. In this
view, metronomic chemotherapy may be an alternative to conventional chemotherapy because it provides several favorable effects: 1) delay of the onset
of acquired drug resistance; 2) reduction of host toxicity; 3) lack of prolonged drug-free break; and 4)
antiangiogenic effects.26 In fact, several studies
reported that many cytotoxic drugs, at continuing
lower doses, act on the endothelial cell compartment
of tumors, inducing a potent antiangiogenic effect.27
In addition, TMZ has been used in protracted lowdose schedules and has been demonstrated to
induce antiangiogenic effects in both in vitro and in
vivo models.28,29 In fact, in a preclinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study, Zhou et al30
demonstrated that both TMZ metronomic and conventional regimens have similar activities. Using realtime polymerase chain reaction and Western blot
analyses, some differences were observed in the
serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor
and hypoxia-inducible factor-1-a, suggesting that the
metronomic regimen may be superior to the conventional regimen by preventing the progression of
tumors to a proangiogenic state.
Another advantage of a protracted administration of TMZ, even at relatively low daily doses, is
shown by a significant and prolonged depletion of
the enzyme O6-alkylguanina-DNA alkyltransferase
(AGAT) activity, which could enhance the antitumor
activity of the agent.31 To our knowledge to date, few

2529

clinical studies exist regarding low-dose TMZ administration. A 33% response rate was reported in
patients with recurrent brain tumors (melanoma and
glioma) who were treated with TMZ at a dose of 75
mg/m2 on a daily schedule for 6 to 7 weeks, which is
similar to the response rate reported in patients treated with TMZ on its approved dose schedule.32
A phase 1 trial investigated the combination of
TMZ at a dose of 150 mg/m2 per day administered
every 2 weeks rather than the conventional 4 weeks
(Days 1-7 and 15-21 every 4 weeks), and vinorelbine
at escalating doses. A total of 21 patients with recurrent BM were enrolled, with 2 responses (1 PR and
1 minor) and 6 SD with a median survival of 27
weeks.33
In the current study, using a protracted low-dose
TMZ schedule, we obtained a promising objective
response rate of 48% (13 of 27 patients). A possible
explanation for these results is that in the current
study, 11 of 27 patients (40%) were included in first
RPA class according to RTOG classification,34 and an
objective response rate of 82% and 2 (8%) SDs were
obtained in this group; conversely, among the 6
patients (22%) included in the third RPA class, we
did not observe any objective response. Because
both approximately half of the patients included in
the study had the brain as the only site of distant
metastases and 40% were in RPA class 1, selection
bias could have occurred in our series of patients.
The efficacy and safety of TMZ administered
concurrently with WBRT for patients with newly
diagnosed BMs was also evaluated in recent trials.
The largest of these trials demonstrated a significant
improvement in the response rate and a trend toward improved survival in the combined therapy
arm (8.3 months vs 6.3 months; P 5 .179); however,
it was not statistically significant.35 These results are
completely comparable to those of the current study,
in which we obtained a median OS of 8.8 months.
Conversely, in the current study we used a more
intense dose of TMZ per cycle than any previous experience (1575 mg/m2 compared with 750 mg/m2),
without any serious toxicity reported.
Although the response rates after WBRT vary,
CRs or PRs have been documented in >60% of
patients in randomized controlled studies conducted
by the RTOG. A revision of 8 different randomized
studies in patients with BMs who received WBRT
alone demonstrated median survivals ranging from
2.4 to 4.8 months.23 This palliative approach has not
translated into a survival benefit.36 In fact, although
better than in patients from whom radiotherapy was
withheld, the median survival was still poor and the
majority of patients still died as a direct result of

2530

CANCER

their brain disease. For example, the median survival
for patients with metastatic breast cancer who
received WBRT was in the range of 3 to 4 months,
with 1-year survival rates at 10% to 20%.37
The addition of protracted courses of TMZ to
WBRT did not appear to change the well-documented improvement in neurologic function that can be
achieved with radiotherapy alone; the use of symptomatic drugs such as corticosteroids and anticonvulsant agents decreased during the treatment,
confirming the activity of this schedule.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report specifically discussing the use of protracted
low-dose TMZ for 21 days for the treatment of
patients with BMs from breast cancer and NSCLC.
The results of the current study demonstrate that the
combination of this new TMZ schedule and WBRT is
active and induces few side effects. The durable
responses, favorable TTP, and the improvement in
neurologic status observed in this study offer several
advantages over conventional therapy, encouraging
the design of additional schedules based on the combination of TMZ and other chemotherapeutic agents
in the treatment of breast cancer and NSCLC that
are metastatic to the brain. The combination with
other agents could allow for the control of extrabrain
disease sites that are poorly susceptible to TMZ.
