BACKGROUND: Myc-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with or without a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma
2 (BCL2) rearrangement is associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In this study, the authors
reviewed the outcomes of patients with myc-positive and double-hit NHL at The Ohio State University. METHODS: All patients who
had non-Burkitt, aggressive B-cell NHL from 2008 to 2011 were assessed for the t(14;18) translocation and for v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (CMYC) rearrangements at diagnosis, and all myc-positive patients were included in the current
analysis. Associations with clinical characteristics were described, and univariable and multivariable models were used to assess correlations between clinical variables and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 49 myc-positive patients, 29 patients also had BCL2 rearrangements
(double-hit NHL). No patients underwent autologous stem cell transplantation in first remission. For all myc-positive patients, the median PFS was 16.6 months, and the median OS was 37.7 months. For patients who had double-hit NHL, the median PFS was 8 months,
and the median OS was 12.5 months; whereas the median PFS and OS were not reached for myc-positive patients. A complete
response (CR) after front-line therapy, the presence of t(14;18), International Prognostic Index (IPI) group, and age were associated
with PFS; whereas only the achievement of a CR and age >60 years were associated with OS in the multivariable setting. The median
PFS was 3.3 months, and the median and OS was 7.0 months for patients who did not attain a CR; and the medians were not reached
for patients who achieved a CR (P <.00001). CONCLUSIONS: The achievement of a CR with front-line therapy is associated with a
prolonged PFS and OS in patients with myc-positive NHL, even after adjusting for type of initial therapy, histology, age, IPI, or the

INTRODUCTION
Rearrangements involving v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (CMYC) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic
leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) have been associated with adverse outcomes in aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(NHL). CMYC rearrangements are identified in 5% to 13% of newly diagnosed cases of aggressive B-cell NHL.1-4 Patients
who had lymphomas harboring a CMYC rearrangement (ie, myc-positive) were associated with decreased 5-year progressionfree survival (PFS) (31%; P 5 .006) and overall survival (OS) (33%; P 5 .016) compared with myc-negative patients in a series of 135 patients who had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with combined rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP).1 Myc-positive patients with BCL2 (or BCL6) rearrangements (doublehit NHL) have a particularly poor prognosis, and standard therapy is not effective for these patients. In a review of 20 patients
who had double-hit NHL, the median OS of 4.5 months was significantly shorter than that in matched controls with Burkitt
lymphoma (P 5 .002) or DLBCL (P 5 .04).5 Another series of 54 patients with double-hit NHL included 36 patients who
had B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable between Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (BCLU), 17 patients
who had DLBCL, and 1 patient who had follicular lymphoma. Fifty-nine percent of those patients died within 6 months of
diagnosis after treatment with combined cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) (n 5 23); R-

CHOP (n 5 11); autologous stem cell transplantation
(n 5 6); or palliative therapy (n 5 14).6 Green et al identified 193 patients with DLBCL, including 11 with doublehit NHL, and those patients had a median PFS of 6 months
and an OS of 13 months when they received R-CHOP7;
whereas another series identified 14 patients with doublehit DLBCL who had a 5-year PFS rate of 18% and an OS
rate of 27% among those who received R-CHOP.3
Given the poor prognosis for these patients, novel
therapeutic approaches are being examined. In one trial, 12
patients who received dose-adjusted (DA) rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (DA-R-EPOCH) had a median PFS of 21 months
compared with 6 months for patients who received RCHOP (n 5 15) and 6 months for patients who received
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and
methotrexate alternating with rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, cytarabine (R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC) (n 5 6)8; and, in
another trial, 6 patients with myc-positive DLBCL who
received DA-R-EPOCH had a 2-year PFS rate of 83%.9
However, Jaglal et al identified a survival advantage for
patients with BCLU who received R-CHOP compared
with patients who received other regimens in a series of 31
patients (including some with MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements), with a median OS of 33 months using RCHOP versus 17 months using the other regimens
(P 5 .048).10 Other approaches in these patients include
consolidation with autologous stem cell transplantation in
first remission. We reviewed the outcomes of patients with
myc-positive and double-hit NHL at our institution, where
autologous stem cell transplantation in first remission is not
offered, and all patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL and
BCLU are evaluated for CMYC and BCL2 rearrangements.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

All patients with untreated, de novo, aggressive B-cell
NHL (DLBCL or BCLU) who were positive for a CMYC
rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) between January 2008 and December 2011 were
included. Patients who had follicular, Burkitt, or transformed NHL and those who had CMYC rearrangements
identified only at relapse were not included.

CMYC dual-color, break-apart probe (Abbott Molecular,
Des Plains, Ill). Patients were also screened for the immunoglobulin heavy locus (IGH)/BCL2 translocation using a
dual-color, dual-fusion translocation probe (Abbott Molecular). The diagnostic specimens also were reviewed centrally by hematopathologists.
Response Assessment

Response was determined at the completion of therapy by
the treating physician. In addition, all available interim
(n 5 25) and post-treatment (n 5 21) positron emission
tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) studies
were centrally reviewed by 1 nuclear medicine physician
who was blinded to the initial interpretation of the scans,
and response was assessed with the Deauville criteria using
hepatic uptake as the reference.11
Statistical Analyses

Clinical, demographic, and pathologic characteristics
were assessed and summarized across all patients as well as
between those with versus without a BCL2 rearrangement.
Associations of myc-positive NHL versus double-hit NHL
with these characteristics were evaluated using Fisher exact
tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests
for continuous variables. PFS and OS were calculated
from the date of diagnosis to the date of disease progression and/or death; and progression-free patients who
remained alive were censored at the time of their last
follow-up. Univariable Cox regression models were used
to assess the correlations of characteristics with PFS and
OS. The characteristics or markers that were significant in
the univariate setting were carried forward for evaluation
in the multivariable setting, and best subsets modeling
and concordance statistics were used to assess the best
models for PFS and OS. Agreement on results from PET/
CT for interim scans versus post-treatment scans was evaluated using a Kappa statistic.12 For all analyses, statistical
significance was defined as P < .05. All analyses were conducted using the statistical program R (version 2.15.2
GUI 1.53 Leopard build 64-bit; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Pathologic Evaluation and FISH

All formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node samples from patients with aggressive B-cell NHL that were
identified between January 2008 and December 2011
were evaluated prospectively at the time of diagnosis for
the presence of a CMYC rearrangement by FISH using a

Forty-nine patients were identified who had CMYC rearrangements, 29 patients had double-hit NHL (59%), 14
patients were myc-positive without a BCL2 rearrangement, and 6 patients were myc-positive but were not
assessed for BCL2 rearrangement. Thirty-seven patients
(76%) were diagnosed with DLBCL, 11 patients (22%)

had BCLU, and 1 patient (2%) was unable to be classified. The patients with double-hit NHL tended to present
with higher stage disease (P 5 .086) and with higher IPI
scores (P 5 .005) compared with patients who did not
have a BCL2 rearrangement. Remaining clinical characteristics are described in Table 1.
Therapy Received

Initial therapy varied across patients and included RCHOP (n 5 17), DA-R-EPOCH (n 5 17), a Burkitt-like
regimen ([R-CODOXM/R-IVAC]; rituximab, hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, methotrexate, and cytarabine [R-HyperCVAD]; or R-CHOP with high-dose methotrexate;
n 5 11), or an alternative regimen (n 5 4). Initial therapy
was different between the 2 groups: the patients with
double-hit NHL were more likely to receive DA-REPOCH or a Burkitt-like regimen, whereas myc-positive
patients were more likely to receive R-CHOP (P 5 .013).
In addition, morphology was significantly associated with

induction regimen (P 5 .001), and patients who had
BCLU were more likely to receive a Burkitt-like regimen
(64% vs 11%) and were less likely to receive R-CHOP
(9% vs 43%) compared with patients who had DLBCL.
Physician-Assessed Response to Therapy

Nine patients died before the first response assessment after 1 (n 5 5), 2 (n 5 3), or 3 (n 5 1) cycles of therapy. Of
the 40 remaining patients, 38 patients were assessed with
PET/CT, 1 patient was assessed with CT, and 1 patient
who had central nervous system disease was assessed with
CT and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-nine
of 49 treated patients (59%) achieved a complete response
(CR) by physician assessment, and 20 did not (partial
response [PR], n 5 2; stable disease, n 5 1; refractory disease, n 5 8; death before assessment, n 5 9). Both patients
who did not undergo a PET/CT scan achieved a
physician-assessed CR and were relapse-free at last followup. Thirteen of the 29 patients with double-hit NHL
achieved a CR (45%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26%1679

64%), including 7 patients who received DA-R-EPOCH,
3 patients who received R-CHOP, and 3 patients who
received a Burkitt-like regimen. In 14 myc-positive only
patients, 10 achieved a CR (71%; 95% CI, 42%-92%),
including 6 who received R-CHOP, 1 who received DAR-EPOCH, 2 who received a Burkitt-like regimen, and 1
who received other regimens. Decreased IPI (P 5 .002)
and lack of B-symptoms (P 5 .02) at diagnosis were both
associated with achievement of a CR in the univariate set1680

Centrally Reviewed Post-Treatment and Interim
PET/CT

Post-treatment PET/CT scans were available for central
review from 25 of the 40 patients who completed induction therapy, including 16 patients who had documented
double-hit NHL. Ten post-treatment PET/CT scans
were negative by central review, including 7 from patients
with double-hit NHL. Fifteen post-treatment PET/CT
scans were positive by central review, including 9 from
patients with double-hit NHL. Of 19 patients who
achieved a physician-assessed CR and had post-treatment
scans available, 9 were positive by central review, and all
remain in remission at last follow-up after initial frontline therapy. Among these 9 patients, the maximum
standard uptake value (SUV) for sites that were considered positive by central review ranged from 2.4 to 4.3,
whereas the difference between active sites and liver
uptake ranged from 0.5 to 1.5. The 6 remaining positive
post-treatment PET/CT scans were from patients who
had primary refractory disease (n 5 5) or who achieved a
physician-assessed PR (n 5 1). All 5 refractory patients
died within 15 months of diagnosis, and the patient who
had a PR progressed and died 14 months after diagnosis.
Twenty-eight patients had centrally reviewed interim PET/CT scans, including 18 patients with doublehit NHL; these interim PET/CT scans were conducted after 2 (n 5 12), 3 (n 5 11), or 4 (n 5 4) cycles of therapy.
Twenty-three patients were positive on interim PET/CT
scans, including 15 with double-hit NHL. Overall, 24
patients had both post-treatment and interim PET/CT
scans available for central review; for 18 patients, the 2
scans were concordant; and, overall, the PET/CT results
had moderate agreement between interim and posttreatment scans (kappa 5 0.47; P 5 .02). Among all 28
patients who had an available interim PET/CT scan, the
results of the interim scan accurately predicted the
physician-assessed response at the completion of therapy
in 14 patients. Although the negative predictive value of a
negative interim PET/CT scan for end-of therapy
response was 100%, the positive predictive value was only
26%.
PFS and OS Outcomes

At the time of these analyses, 24 patients had died, and
the median follow-up was 28.5 months (range, 7.8-45.3
months) in living patients. The median PFS across all 49

myc-positive patients was 16.6 months (95% CI, 8
months to not yet reached [NR]). The median PFS for
documented double-hit patients was 8 months (95% CI,
5.4 months to NR), whereas the median PFS for myc-positive only patients had not been reached (95% CI, 16.6
months to NR; P 5 .049) (Fig. 1A). Variables that were
significantly associated with PFS included IPI
(P 5 .0005), age (P 5 .001), and B-symptoms (P 5 .02)
(see Table 3). Attainment of a physician-assessed CR to
induction therapy was highly significant for PFS
(P < .00001), and the median PFS for patients who
achieved a CR had not been reached (95% CI, NR to
Cancer

NR) compared with 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.0-7.1
months) for patients who did not achieve a CR
(P < .00001) (Fig. 2A). Nineteen of the 20 patients who
did not achieve a CR progressed, and none survived to
undergo transplantation. One patient was lost to followup at 14 months without evidence of relapse. Four of the
29 patients who had a physician-assessed CR relapsed at 6
months, 10 months, 11 months, and 17 months,
although 2 patients were successfully salvaged by autologous transplantation and remained in remission. The median PFS for patients with documented double-hit NHL
who achieved a CR had not yet been reached (95% CI,
NR to NR) versus 3.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-8.0 months)
for those who did not achieve a CR (P < .0001). In the 14
patients documented to not have t(14;18), the median
PFS had not yet been reached in the 10 patients who
achieved a CR (95% CI, NR to NR) versus a median PFS
of 2.7 months in the 4 patients who did not achieve a CR
(95% CI, 1.9 months to NR).
The median OS for the entire cohort was 37.7
months (95% CI, 13.9 months to NR). The median OS
for those with double-hit NHL was 12.5 months (95%
CI, 8.2 months to NR), and the estimated medians and
CIs for OS were not yet reached for the myc-positive
patients without documented t(14;18) as well as those
with documented absence of t(14;18). The documented
presence or absence of t(14;18) was significantly associated with OS (P 5 .037) (Fig. 1B). In the univariate setting, increased IPI (P 5 .0005), increased age at diagnosis
(P 5 .015), the presence of B-symptoms (P 5 0.014), and
failure to achieve a CR (P < .00001) were significantly
associated with shortened OS (see Table 3). The median
OS for those patients who did not achieve a physicianassessed CR was 7.0 months (95% CI, 2.0-12.5 months)
compared with a median not reached for those who did
achieve a CR (95% CI, NR to NR; P < .00001)
(Fig. 2B).
Among the 22 patients who have died, 18 had
double-hit NHL, 3 were documented as myc-positive
only, and 1 was myc-positive with unknown t(14;18) status. Causes of death included progressive disease
(n 5 12), organ failure (n 5 3), sepsis/infection (n 5 4),
cardiac arrest (n 5 1), and unknown causes (n 5 2).
Nineteen of the 20 patients who failed to achieve a CR
have died. Three of the 29 patients who achieved a
physician-assessed CR died 2 months after a relapse, 28
months after relapse and 5 courses of salvage chemotherapy, and of unknown causes 33 months after diagnosis
with no evidence of relapse. In 9 patients who died early
before response assessment, induction therapies included

Multivariable Analyses

In multivariable analyses, we evaluated the influence of
achieving a CR and having documented double-hit NHL
(excluding those with unknown t[14;18] status) on PFS
and OS while adjusting for IPI, age at diagnosis, and the
presence of B symptoms; in the end, the optimal models
for both PFS and OS only adjusted for whether or not age
at diagnosis was >60 years (Table 4). In the multivariable
model for PFS, achievement of CR was significantly associated with increased PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.027;
P < .00001), and documented double-hit NHL status
was still significantly associated with a worse prognosis
(HR, 4.46; P 5 .033) as was age at diagnosis >60 years
(HR, 4.98; P 5 .004). In multivariable analyses for OS,
achieving a CR was significant and was associated with
improved survival (HR, 0.01; P 5 .00002) as well as
whether or not the patient was aged >60 years at diagnosis
(HR, 4.46; P 5 .009). Even when the 6 patients with
unknown t(14;18) status were included as myc-positive
patients in the OS model, the results did not change. Evaluations of the PFS and OS distributions based on both
double-hit NHL status and achievement of CR are illustrated in Figure 3.

DISCUSSION
Our retrospective studies indicate that 59% of patients
with myc-positive and double-hit lymphomas can achieve
a CR with initial therapy, and the estimated 2-year PFS
rate was 81% (95% CI, 68%-98%) for the patients who
achieved a CR. Even with double-hit lymphoma, 45% of
these patients were able to achieve a CR with an estimated
2-year PFS rate of 83% (95% CI, 64%-99%). In our series, morphology and induction regimen were not associated with CR, PFS, or OS. Although documented
double-hit NHL, IPI, age at diagnosis, and the presence
of B-symptoms were associated with OS in univariable
analysis, only CR was independently associated with OS
in multivariable analysis, suggesting that initial response
to front-line therapy is an important prognostic factor.
This independent association of CR with PFS and OS was
significant despite the removal of 6 patients from the analysis who were myc-positive but did not have an assessment
for t(14;18). Whereas t(14;18) status and age remained
significant in the multivariable setting for PFS, their significance was borderline (P 5 .046 and P 5 .045, respectively); achievement of CR was a clear and strong
prognostic factor (P 5 .0006).
Patients in our series with myc-positive NHL but
without t(14;18), many of whom received treatment with
R-CHOP, had not reached a median PFS after >2 years
of follow-up. These findings are in contrast to the series

patients with DLBCL, of which 11 to 35 patients were
myc-positive, and myc-positive patients had inferior PFS
and OS.1,13-15 A review of 57 patients with BCLU,
including 30 who were myc-positive, indicated that mycpositive patients had shortened PFS with R-CHOP compared with more intensive regimens (P 5 .0358).16
Because our series did not include a group without CMYC
rearrangements, definitive comparisons cannot be made
with myc-negative patients. However, our data suggest
that patients with myc-positive DLBCL without t(14;18)

may not require intensification of therapy, especially in
the absence of other clinical risk factors.
Many centers incorporate autologous transplantation in first remission for all of their patients with doublehit NHL, which, based on our current study, may not be
necessary for patients who achieve a CR. None of our
patients who failed to achieve a CR responded to salvage
therapy or underwent autologous transplantation. Therefore, earlier recognition of these poor responders may be
necessary. Unfortunately, in our trial, interim PET studies
or other pretreatment characteristics like stage, IPI, etc,
did not readily predict which patients were unlikely to
respond. In addition, 9 patients died during initial induction therapy, highlighting the truly dismal prognosis for
these patients and the limited time available to alter therapy to favorably impact disease outcomes.
We recognize the limitations of relying on a physician assessment of response using a PET/CT scan at the
time of therapy; therefore, we included a central review of
all available interim and post-treatment PET/CT scans by
1 nuclear medicine physician. It is noteworthy that 9
patients who were deemed to be in CR after completing
therapy by their treating physician actually had a positive
post-treatment PET/CT scan by central review. None of
these patients have relapsed, suggesting that using standard criteria without clinical assessment may expose
patients inappropriately to additional therapy.
Although our limited sample makes it challenging to
draw conclusions regarding the impact of an interim
PET/CT scan, its prognostic value in patients with aggressive NHL remains unclear. Cashen et al reported a series
of 50 patients with DLBCL who received R-CHOP and
underwent interim PET/CT scans. In that study, a positive PET/CT scan, interpreted according to International
Harmonization Project criteria,17 had only a 42% positive
predictive value for relapse.18 Pregno and colleagues evaluated 88 patients with DLBCL who received R-CHOP,
and interim PET/CT scans had only a 36% positive

Original Article

Green and colleagues identified 29% of patients in their
series with overexpression of both Myc and Bcl2 proteins,
and this was associated with shorter OS and PFS compared with patients who had 1 or 0 proteins overexpressed.7 Johnson et al evaluated 307 patients with
DLBCL in a training set and a validation set. In that
study, Myc was overexpressed in 100 patients, whereas
FISH indicated that only 12% of patients were myc-positive. Overexpression by IHC of both myc and bcl2 was
associated with inferior PFS and OS (P < .05).3 Consequently, assessment by IHC may identify a larger group of
patients who are at increased risk for poor outcomes that
may not be identified through FISH alone. However, it
may not be feasible to treat so many patients with more
intensive therapy when a large portion may otherwise
achieve a CR with standard R-CHOP.3,7 Given the retrospective nature of our study, these specific analyses were
not routinely performed.
In conclusion, myc-positive and double-hit NHLs
continue to present therapeutic challenges. Here, we have
identified a subset of patients who achieved a CR and
experienced prolonged remissions, whereas those who
failed to do so had dismal outcomes. The development of
effective front-line regimens is needed, as salvage opportunities are limited because of rapid disease progression and
early death. In addition, the identification of risk factors
for patients associated with a failure to achieve a CR will
aid in determining which patients with myc-positive NHL
should receive standard front-line therapy versus those
who are more suited for experimental approaches.

predictive value for progression.19 Interim PET/CT scans
in our series had a positive predictive value of 26%, again
suggesting that prolonged remission is possible despite a
positive interim PET/CT result.
Recent data have suggested that the translocation
partner for CMYC may influence outcome, because those
patients who have a nonimmunoglobulin gene translocation partner may have prolonged PFS.20 In addition, myc
and bcl2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) has also been associated with inferior PFS and OS.
