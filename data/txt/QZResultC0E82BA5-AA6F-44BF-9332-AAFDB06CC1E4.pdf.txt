Abstract
We are developing a noninvasive approach for targeting
imaging and therapeutic radionuclides to prostate cancer.
Our method, Enzyme-Mediated Cancer Imaging and Therapy
(EMCIT), aims to use enzyme-dependent, site-specific, in vivo
precipitation of a radioactive molecule within the extracellular space of solid tumors. Advanced methods for data mining
of the literature, protein databases, and knowledge bases
(IT.Omics LSGraph and Ingenuity Systems) identified prostatic
acid phosphatase (PAP) as an enzyme overexpressed in
prostate cancer and secreted in the extracellular space.
Using AutoDock 3.0 software, the prodrug ammonium 2-(2¶phosphoryloxyphenyl)-6-iodo-4-(3H)-quinazolinone (IQ2-P)
was docked in silico into the X-ray structure of PAP. The data
indicate that IQ2-P docked into the PAP active site with a
calculated inhibition constant (K i) more favorable than that of
the PAP inhibitor A-benzylaminobenzylphosphonic acid.
When 125IQ2-P, the radioiodinated form of the water-soluble
prodrug, was incubated with PAP, rapid hydrolysis of the
compound was observed as exemplified by formation of the
water-insoluble 2-(2¶-hydroxyphenyl)-6-[125I]iodo-4-(3H)-quinazolinone (125IQ2-OH). Similarly, the incubation of IQ2-P with
human LNCaP, PC-3, and 22Rv1 prostate tumor cells resulted
in the formation of large fluorescent IQ2-OH crystals. No
hydrolysis was seen in the presence of normal human cells.
Autoradiography of tumor cells incubated with 125IQ2-P
showed accumulation of radioactive grains (125IQ2-OH) around
the cells. We anticipate that the EMCIT approach will enable
the active in vivo entrapment of radioimaging and radiotherapeutic compounds within the extracellular spaces of
primary prostate tumors and their metastases. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in
men (33%) and the second leading cause of cancer death in the
United States (10%).3 The American Cancer Society estimates that
234,300 new cases of invasive prostate cancer will be identified in
the United States this year. A substantial proportion of these
people will develop metastatic disease at some point, and f30,000
will die. Routine diagnosis is based on prostate-specific antigen

determination in blood or discovery of a palpable mass within the
prostate. Despite current therapies, the outcome is often lymph
node spread, bone metastases, and death.
The development of technologies that enable noninvasive
determination of this disease and therapeutic intervention at an
early stage is clearly to be desired. Such technologies would be
designed to detect prostate cancer, move meaningful intervention
to an earlier point in its progression, prevent the development
of metastatic disease, and minimize patient inconvenience and
incapacitation. Toward these objectives, we present a novel
approach, Enzyme-Mediated Cancer Imaging and Therapy (EMCIT;
refs. 1–5), which potentially enables the active entrapment of a
radioisotopically labeled compound within the extracellular spaces
of primary prostate tumors and their metastases (Fig. 1). This
noninvasive technique is based on the rapid uptake of radioactive
molecules and their enzyme-dependent, site-specific, in vivo
precipitation within solid tumors (in contrast to minimal uptake
in normal tissues). The compound can be labeled with an isotope
having decay characteristics suitable for positron emission
tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging (e.g., 123I and 124I) or for therapy (e.g., 131I).
The prototype for this approach was first developed for alkaline
phosphatase (ALP; EC 3.1.3.1), a hydrolase with monophosphoesteric activity that is overexpressed on the plasma membranes
of many tumor cell types (1, 2, 6, 7). A suitable substrate, the
prodrug ammonium 2-(2¶-phosphoryloxyphenyl)-6-iodo-4-(3H)quinazolinone (127IQ2-P), and its radioiodinated analogue (125IQ2-P)
were synthesized, purified, and characterized (1, 5), and their
ALP-mediated hydrolysis to the water-insoluble, fluorescent 2-(2¶hydroxyphenyl)-6-iodo-4-(3H)-quinazolinone derivatives (127IQ2-OH
and 125IQ2-OH) was shown (1, 3, 5). These studies also indicated
that (a) IQ2-P is a highly water-soluble molecule (mg/mL) that is
stable in human serum and readily dephosphorylated by ALP to
the water-insoluble IQ2-OH derivative; (b) the in vitro incubation of
127
IQ2-P/125IQ2-P derivatives with several ALP-expressing human
and mouse tumor cell lines results in the efficient and rapid
formation of the corresponding water-insoluble derivatives 127IQ2-OH/
125
IQ2-OH; and (c) the intratumoral injection of 125IQ2-P into
ALP-expressing solid human tumors grown in rats leads to the
efficient hydrolysis of the compound and the retention of f70% of
the injected radioactivity, whereas similar injection into normal
tissues (e.g., muscle) leads to little measurable hydrolysis (f1%)
and lack of retention of radioactivity at injected sites. In addition,
we observed that the pharmacokinetic properties of IQ2-P in mice
were not consistent (5). Subsequently, we recognized that the

synthesis of its stannylated quinazolinone precursor (SnQ2-P)
produces a mixture of two compounds, SnQ2-P and SnQ2-P(I)
(f1:1 ratio), whose radioiodination leads to the formation of
125
IQ2-P and its cyclic isoform 125IQ2-P(I), respectively. Both iodinated
molecules have been docked onto ALP, and the data indicate that
the calculated binding energies for 125IQ2-P are more favorable than
for its cyclic isoform (3). Furthermore, it has been shown that pure
125
IQ2-P can be prepared following an overnight incubation of the tin
precursor mixture in DMSO and that, on its i.v. injection into mice,
there is minimal retention (<0.4% injected dose per gram) of
radioactivity in all normal tissues (5).
The aim of our current investigation is to identify a hydrolase
analogous to ALP that would be suitable for the EMCIT of prostate
cancer because ALP is not known to be expressed in prostate
tumors. To find such a target candidate, we recently developed an
in silico ‘‘combined data-mining approach’’ that is based on several
resources (literature text, structured databases, and knowledge
bases), the retrieval capabilities of data-mining tools to extract
proteins from these resources, the filtering of entities by gene
ontologies, and the enlargement of the list of potential target
candidates by functionally related proteins (2). One of the targets on
the list obtained by this combined data-mining approach is human
prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). This hydrolase was selected
because it is a phosphatase that is expressed and secreted
exclusively by the prostate and overexpressed and abundantly
secreted by prostate cancer cells (8–10). Consequently, serum levels
of PAP are frequently elevated in patients and are used as a marker
for the disease (11–15). Although PAP has never fully achieved the
status of an indispensable frontline test among urologists, lymph
node metastases and/or extensions (consequent to a breach of the

prostate capsule) are invariably accompanied by a rise in serum PAP
(15). Moreover, it is well established that the intense and selective
PAP expression seen in human prostate tumor cells correlates with
serum levels of the enzyme (16).
To investigate whether the EMCIT concept that brought
promising results with ALP could be applied to PAP-expressing
prostate tumors, the three-dimensional structure of PAP was used
with the advanced docking algorithm of AutoDock 3.0 for the
automated computational docking of the potential ligand into the
active site of the target. The simulated binding of both IQ2-P and
IQ2-P(I) was achieved, and binding free energy (DG, a measure of
binding strength), intermolecular interactions, and binding affinity
in terms of the inhibition constant (K i) were obtained. We also
incubated the prodrugs 127IQ2-P and 125IQ2-P with purified PAP to
experimentally ascertain their hydrolysis and, thereby, confirm the
docking results and, subsequently, with several human prostate
tumor cell lines and normal human cell types to evaluate the
dephosphorylation and precipitation of the drug (125IQ2-OH) as a
product of hydrolysis.

Materials and Methods
Data mining. As we were interested in phosphatases that are localized
in the extracellular space or on the cell surface of prostate cancer cells,
databases were thoroughly searched for enzymes with the following
characteristics: (a) citation in the literature in relation to prostatic tissues,
(b) expression in the extracellular space or attachment to the plasma
membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol or the extracellular domain of a
transmembrane protein, and (c) possession of phosphatase activity. The
data mining was based on our recently developed strategy (2) using a
combination of the advanced pathway analysis software applications

attack on phosphorus atom and Asp258 is close to assist in catalytic process.

LSGraph version 1.5 (Life Science Graph,4 IT.Omics, Lille, France) and
Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) version 2.0 (Ingenuity Systems,5
Mountain View, CA; Fig. 1). Both LSGraph and IPA are knowledge-based
applications that can identify the biological mechanisms, pathways, and
functions most relevant to a data set of genes or proteins of interest. The
following sequence of steps specific to the prostate case was used in this
analysis. (a) LSGraph queried PubMed abstracts that contain evidences of
protein-protein relationships and are related to the keyword ‘‘prostate’’ or
‘‘prostatic.’’ (b) The cellular localization of proteins was defined by the Gene
Ontology terms ‘‘extracellular region’’ (GO ID: 0005576) and ‘‘membrane’’
(GO ID: 0016020), and the list of proteins containing these annotation terms
was created. (c) This list of proteins was exported from LSGraph and
submitted to the functional analysis of IPA. The entities were filtered down
to the set known to be involved in prostate cancer by selecting the IPA
subnetworks in which the disease cancer occurs as the most significant
annotation. The final set of filtered entities was exported and stored in a
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Extracellular phosphatases were analyzed
using the original scientific literature. A phosphatase with properties
suitable for EMCIT and with known three-dimensional structure was
selected.
Molecular docking. The target identified by data mining was PAP.
Three-dimensional coordinates of the crystallized structure of PAP with

a-benzylaminobenzylphosphonic acid (BABPA) were obtained from the
Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank
(RCSB PDB; PDB ID: 1ND5).6 To test the accuracy of the docking in
reproducing the X-ray complex, docking of BABPA was first directed into
monomer A (chain A) of PAP using the AutoDock software version 3.0
(Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The program was run on a Silicon
Graphics Octane workstation. We then docked IQ2-P as well as IQ2-P(I)
(Fig. 2), a cyclic analogue that was discovered during the synthesis of IQ2-P
(see Introduction and Results and Discussion) and that had been shown to
be a very poor substrate for ALP (3).
Three-dimensional conformers of all three derivatives were prepared
using Chem3D of ChemOffice Ultra7 and minimized into the optimal
conformation with its module MM2 [molecular mechanics method to final
root-mean-square (RMS) gradient of 0.100 Å in vacuum]. The AutoDock
Tool was applied to prepare ligands in docking format and to visualize the
results. Gasteiger atomic charges were assigned and the flexibility of the
molecule was determined using the AutoDock module AutoTors. All torsion
angles were defined so that they could be explored during the docking
process. Nonpolar hydrogens, including their partial charges, were merged
to parent atoms. The atomic solvation variables were assigned by the
AutoDock module Addsol. All three ligands were used in the charged form
(i.e., phosphonic group in BABPA, phosphatidic group in IQ2-P, and

phosphoramidic group in IQ2-P(I); Fig. 2). For docking studies, these groups
were deprotonated to simulate the dianionic (IQ2-P) or monoanionic
(IQ2-P(I)) intermediate state (17).
The following protocol was used for docking PAP and the ligands. The
active site of PAP was defined as amino acid residues 7 Å from the bound
ligand. Atomic interaction energy grids were calculated with the AutoDock
module AutoGrid 3.0 for atom probes corresponding to each atom type in
the ligand. The probes were calculated at every 0.35-Å grid position of a grid
box (box size in Å; x, y, z = 45.3, 69, 59.3, respectively) centered at the xyz
coordinates of the original phosphorus atom of BABPA in the PAP-BABPA
complex. The grid box included the entire active site and provided sufficient
space for ligand translational and rotational movement. All histidines were
allocated as singly protonated, and arginine, lysine, aspartate, and
glutamate residues were treated as ionized. For the docking process itself,
the Lamarckian genetic algorithm implemented in AutoDock 3.0 was used
to search the optimal ligand conformation and orientation within the PAP
active site while keeping the residues of the protein rigid. In general, the
default variables of AutoDock were used.
Docked compounds were clustered into groups with RMS deviation
(RMSD) of docked versus X-ray atom positions <1.0 Å. Ten runs were
executed and the largest cluster with the most favorable free binding energy
was chosen for analysis; the best docking poses of BABPA, IQ2-P, and IQ2-P(I)
are shown in Fig. 2. Binding free energy (DG) and binding constants (K i)
were calculated and estimated within the AutoDock scoring function
(Fig. 2). The obtained complex was used for interpretation of the potential
bioactivities of the ligands.
Synthesis and PAP-dependent conversion of prodrugs 125IQ2-P
and 125IQ2-P(I) to drug 125IQ2-OH in solution. The ammonium 2-(2¶phosphoryloxyphenyl)-6-[125I/127I]iodo-4-(3H )-quinazolinone analogues
127
IQ2-P/127IQ2-P(I) and 125IQ2-P/125IQ2-P(I) were synthesized as reported by
Wang et al. (5). Briefly, a mixture of SnQ2-P-SnQ2-P(I) was synthesized and
immediately radioiodinated in the presence of iodogen and Na125I, and the
mixture of 125IQ2-P and 125IQ2-P(I) produced (2 AL, 0.1 mCi/AL) was
incubated with 1 unit PAP per AL PBS (0.01 mol/L, pH 7.4) containing
50 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, and 0.1 mmol/L ZnCl2 at 37jC for
5 min. The retention time of each incubation sample on high-performance
liquid chromatography [HPLC; reverse-phase Zorbax SB-C18 column,
9.4  250 mm (Agilent Technologies), with UV absorption (Waters 486)
and g-ray (g-ram, IN/US Systems) detectors used to analyze eluates]
was determined and compared with that of the sample before the addition
of PAP.
It is well known that the prostatic secretory protein PAP is often elevated in the sera of patients with prostate cancer (11–15). To determine
the concentration of PAP required to hydrolyze 125IQ2-P to 125IQ2-OH, the
SnQ2-P-SnQ2-P(I) mixture was incubated for z24 h in DMSO before its
radioiodination, as this procedure has been shown to lead to the
quantitative conversion of SnQ2-P(I) to SnQ2-P and the production of
125
IQ2-P after radioiodination (5). This 100% pure radioiodinated quinazolinone derivative (2 AL, 0.1 mCi/AL) was then incubated with various
concentrations of PAP (between 0.001 and 1 unit/AL) for 5 min, and the
formation of 125IQ2-OH was assessed by HPLC. After integrating the peak
areas of the compounds, the ratios of conversion of 125IQ2-P to 125IQ2-OH
were determined. A plot of PAP concentration (abscissa) versus formation
of 125IQ2-OH (ordinate) furnished a sigmoidal line from which the IC50 value
and the minimum concentration of PAP necessary for any hydrolysis were
calculated.
In vitro hydrolysis of 127IQ2-P/125IQ2-P by human prostate tumor
cells and normal mammalian cells assessed by fluorescence microscopy and autoradiography. The following cell lines were used: LNCaP
[American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)], a cell line isolated from a
lymph node biopsy of a patient with confirmed diagnosis of metastatic
prostate carcinoma; PC-3 (ATCC), a human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell
line derived from a metastatic bone site; 22Rv1 (ATCC), a human prostate
carcinoma epithelial cell line; and HMEC (Cambrex Corp., East Rutherford,
NJ), a human mammary epithelial cell line. The cells were trypsinized,
suspended in medium, and seeded onto glass slides. After an overnight
incubation at 37jC, the medium was removed, and the cells were

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

reincubated with 127IQ2-P (0.1 mg/mL, fluorescence microscope studies) or
125
IQ2-P (10 ACi/mL, autoradiography). At various times (1–48 h), the cells
were observed under a fluorescence microscope, and the density of the
green crystals formed was semiquantitatively recorded (0: no fluorescent
crystals; +1: a few scattered fluorescent crystals; +2 to +4: increasing
numbers of crystals; +5: cells completely covered with crystals). In addition,
the cells were repeatedly washed in PBS after the 24- and 48-h incubations
and then fixed in ice-cold ethanol. For fluorescence microscopy, the
washed/fixed cells were counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; a nuclear stain) and the distribution and intensity of fluorescent
crystals were observed and compared with those before washing of the cell
monolayers. For autoradiography, the slides were dipped vertically into
Kodak NTB-2 emulsion melted at 41jC, withdrawn, left to drain and gel,
and then stored at 20jC in a black box containing Drierite (1 day to
2 weeks). Next, the emulsion-coated slides were incubated at 16jC in Kodak
developer D-19 for 3 min, fixed in Kodak Fixer for 5 min, rinsed in distilled
water, counterstained with DAPI, and viewed under a microscope
( fluorescence/light).

Results and Discussion
Data mining. Our method of data mining using LSGraph and
IPA, complemented by Gene Ontology and PubMed, to search
through literature, protein databases, and knowledge bases
identified 375 proteins involved in the extracellular space in
prostate cancer. The large size of the list was due to Gene Ontology
filtering within the context of the cellular components ‘‘extracellular region’’ and ‘‘membrane’’ and the inclusion of functionally
related neighbors using LSGraph and IPA. The primary purpose
of the data mining was to determine new target phosphatases
showing, in analogy to alkaline phosphatase–based EMCIT
(1–5), the capacity to catalyze the conversion of water-soluble,
nonfluorescent IQ2-P to water-insoluble, fluorescent IQ2-OH. Using
the combined data-mining strategy based on LSGraph and
IPA, PAP was identified as a suitable candidate for further study
(Fig. 1).
Human PAP possesses protein tyrosine phosphatase activity and
is secreted as a glycosylated homodimer in the seminal fluid of the
prostate gland (17). Like most phosphomonoesterases, it hydrolyzes
a wide spectrum of substrates, including alkyl, aryl, and other
phosphate derivatives (17, 18). Despite its acidic pH preference for
optimal activity (contrary to the alkaline pH preference of ALP), it
was nevertheless considered likely to catalyze the dephosphorylation of IQ2-P to IQ2-OH. Whereas PAP is known to dephosphorylate
the epidermal growth factor receptor at an intracellular site of
prostate carcinoma cells (19), it has also been observed to be
secreted by epithelial cells into the prostate gland seminal fluid (20).
Using our data-mining method, PAP was identified as an enzyme
localized in the extracellular space rather than in the cytoplasm,
associated with the Gene Ontology term ‘‘extracellular region’’
(in Entrez Gene for human PAP: gene name ACPP) or ‘‘extracellular
space’’ (in Entrez Gene for mouse PAP: gene name Acpp; or in
UniProt: primary accession number Q8CEO8). Once PAP was
identified in LSGraph, it was then situated by IPA in the prostate
‘‘cancer’’ network as an extracellular phosphatase. The successful
identification of PAP as an extracellular EMCIT candidate is
attributed to the data-mining strategy used (2). This method has
the advantages of the following features of knowledge-based
applications LSGraph and IPA: (a) LSGraph retrieval capability of
all cited entities from PubMed abstracts, (b) selection of entities
associated with Gene Ontology terms ‘‘extracellular region’’ and
‘‘membrane’’, and (c) final overlay of extracellular proteins on the
IPA knowledge base ‘‘disease’’ network ‘‘cancer.’’ Although PAP is

considered an intracellular enzyme, it is clear that our data mining
allows us to classify it as an extracellular protein as well. This notion
is supported by the often reported presence of PAP in sera of
patients (11–16, 21, 22).
Molecular docking. Six crystal structures of PAP have been
resolved and deposited in RCSB PDB ( four human and two rat
structures). The three-dimensional complex of PAP with the known
inhibitor BABPA (PDB ID: 1ND5) was selected for docking of
previously designed and characterized IQ2-P and its cyclic analogue
IQ2-P(I) (5). The PAP-BABPA complex was resolved at the dockingacceptable atomic resolution of 2.9 Å. Docking into the PAP
structure reproduced the PAP-BABPA crystallographic complex
and, thus, provided an estimate of docking accuracy. Furthermore,
the PAP-BABPA complex was selected because the BABPA structure is similar to that of IQ2-P in size and in the presence of aromatic pharmacophores and a phosphorus-containing bulky anionic
group. BABPA is also a potent PAP inhibitor (IC50, 4 nmol/L;
refs. 17, 23), and the predicted (calculated) binding constant of
IQ2-P with PAP can be compared with the predicted and
experimentally determined binding constant of BABPA. In addition,
the conformation of the PAP active site originating from the
PAP-BABPA complex (which during the simulation remains rigid)

emulates the active site of the ligand-containing protein rather
than the empty and open active site of the apoenzyme structure.
The active site of PAP contains positively charged residues Arg11,
Arg15, Arg79, His12, and His257 that create the crown-like structure
able to coordinate the phosphorus group (17). Because the active
site of PAP is closed and not exposed to the solvent, we have
measured the ‘‘tightness’’ of the binding by calculating the free
energy of binding (DG) and the binding constant (K i), both
predictions derived from the AutoDock algorithm. BABPA was
successfully docked to, and oriented at, the position determined in
the crystallized complex with PAP, within 1 Å RMSD of distances of
docked versus crystal ligand atoms (Fig. 2A). The docking results
indicate that the phosphonic group of BABPA complexes with
Arg11, Arg15, Arg79, His12, His257, and Asp258. The benzylamino and
benzyl moieties of the docked compound are within van der Waals
distance of Ile18 and Trp174 as in the case of the crystallized
complex. Furthermore, the docking position of the phosphorus
atom of the phosphonic group of BABPA is close to the crucial
His12 as seen in the crystal structure complex or in other
phosphate-based inhibitors (24, 25).
The PAP inhibitor BABPA and our compound IQ2-P share some
chemical-structural similarities that suggest that IQ2-P may be a

promising ligand. BABPA contains a three-atom bridge, including a
secondary amine atom between its two phenyl rings, which has
some analogy to the structure of IQ2-P. When IQ2-P is docked into
the active site of PAP, the phosphate group is placed within the
phosphate-binding pocket and its quinazolinone moiety interacts
with hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2B). The phosphorus atom is at a
favorable distance for nucleophile attack by His12, leading to the
dephosphorylation of IQ2-P to IQ2-OH, in agreement with the
theoretical axial attack of P by this nucleophile (24, 25). The iodine
atom of the quinazolinone points outward from the active site and
does not hinder the binding to PAP. Moreover, the position of IQ2-P
results in 11 hydrogen bonds (two more than the BABPA complex).
In fact, the resulting binding free energy of IQ2-P (13.39 kcal/mol)
is more favorable than that of the potent inhibitor BABPA (11.90
kcal/mol). The estimated DG and K values are shown in Fig. 2.
Overall, the docking position of IQ2-P and the binding free energy
compared with those of BABPA predict that we have discovered a
prodrug with higher affinity than BABPA, which should be an
excellent substrate for PAP (Fig. 2).
Recently, we realized that ammonium 2-(2¶-phosphoryloxyphenyl)-6-tributylstannyl-4-(3H)-quinazolinone, the intermediate
used to synthesize the radioiodinated derivative, exists as two
isomers (SnQ2-P and SnQ2-P(I)) whose radioiodination leads,
respectively, to 125IQ2-P and 125IQ2-P(I) (Fig. 2), each having different
in vitro and in vivo biological activities (5). To determine the
mechanism underlying the molecular interaction and binding of
IQ2-P(I) to PAP, the docking of this isomer was also accomplished
using the same simulation conditions as for IQ2-P. Due to its
cyclization, IQ2-P(I) shows some different properties. For example,
the cyclic amine atom becomes a tertiary amine rigidly anchored
between two rings; this loss of molecular flexibility probably
decreases the chance of ligand-protein accommodation. Furthermore, the phosphoramidic group becomes chemically adverse to
nucleophile attack when IQ2-P(I) is docked into the active site of PAP
with the phosphoramidic group anchored in the crown (Fig. 2C).
Moreover, IQ2-P(I) is more distally positioned from the crown of
arginines and histidines, and consequently, the distance of the Nq
atom of His12 is too great for axial attack on the phosphorus atom
(>4.14 Å). Consequently, the calculated binding energy of IQ2-P(I) is
significantly lower than that of BABPA and IQ2-P (see table in Fig. 2).
These in silico predictions are in line with our experimental findings
showing both efficient PAP-mediated hydrolysis of IQ2-P and lack
of hydrolysis of IQ2-P(I) (Fig. 3A and B). In previous studies (3), the
interaction/binding between the two isoforms and ALP had also
been examined using in silico molecular modeling and docking
techniques. Docking data show that IQ2-P fits the active binding site
of ALP favorably and interacts with the catalytic amino acid Ser92,
which plays an important role in the hydrolysis process, whereas
IQ2-P(I) does not. These observations are also in line with our
experimental findings showing that IQ2-P is readily dephosphorylated by ALP to water-insoluble IQ2-OH, whereas IQ2-P(I) is not (5).
Kinetics of PAP-dependent conversion of radioiodinated
prodrug 125IQ2-P to radioiodinated drug 125IQ2-OH. Phosphatases, such as PAP and ALP, are often elevated in the sera of
patients with prostate cancer and certain other diseases (11, 12,
26–31). To ascertain that these phosphatases will not lead to
significant hydrolysis of the radioiodinated quinazolinone derivatives during transit/sojourn of these compounds in the blood and
normal tissues of an animal (i.e., before their specific hydrolysis by
the PAP-overexpressing prostate tumor cells), HPLC was used to
determine the minimal PAP concentration necessary to initiate the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

hydrolysis of IQ2-P to IQ2-OH. In these studies, the 125IQ2-P-PAP
incubation time was purposefully kept brief (5 min) because our
previous studies (5) indicate that the residence time of this
compound in blood is short (f10 min). When 125IQ2-P was
incubated with various concentrations of PAP, a dose-dependent
disappearance of this PAP substrate was observed (Fig. 3C and D).
Simultaneously, a single new peak appeared with a retention time
matching that of 125IQ2-OH. After integrating the peak areas, the
percentage conversions of 125IQ2-P to 125IQ2-OH were quantified and
a plot of PAP concentration (abscissa) versus formation of 125IQ2-OH
(ordinate) furnishes a sigmoidal line (IC50, 3,600 units/L). The
minimal PAP concentration needed to hydrolyze 125IQ2-P is
z300 units/L, a value much higher than that reported in the
blood of patients with prostate cancer (median, 7 units/L; ref. 32).
Consequently, these radioiodinated quinazolinone derivatives are
not expected to be hydrolyzed by PAP in the circulation after their
i.v. injection into prostate cancer patients. Similarly, the minimum
ALP concentration needed to hydrolyze 125IQ2-P is z1,000 units/L
(IC50, 23,000 units/L; ref. 5), a value that is f2-fold larger than
the 500 units/L found in the blood of other-than-prostate cancer
patients (26–31).
Hydrolysis of 127IQ2-P/125IQ2-P by prostate cancer cells.
Recently, we showed that the in vitro incubation (37jC, pH 7.4)
of water-soluble nonfluorescent quinazolinone IQ2-P with various
viable ALP-expressing human and mouse tumor cell lines (breast,
colorectal, lung, ovarian, rhabdomyosarcoma, and teratocarcinoma) led to its hydrolysis and the formation of large, fluorescent,
water-insoluble IQ2-OH crystals, whereas no hydrolysis occurred
when tumor cells were incubated in the presence of levamisole,
a specific inhibitor of ALP (3, 5). In the current studies, we determined the ability of three human prostate cancer cell lines
(LNCaP, PC-3, and 22Rv1) to hydrolyze IQ2-P and 125IQ2-P,
respectively, to IQ2-OH and 125IQ2-OH. At a minimum, there are
three factors that may prevent the dephosphorylation of IQ2-P after
its incubation with prostate cancer cells: (a) the pH optima of PAP
(f6) and ALP (f10) are very different; (b) unlike many tumor cell
types, prostate cancer cells are known to express PAP and not ALP
(2); and (c) PAP secretion of two of these cell lines (PC-3 and 22Rv1)
is either unknown or currently controversial (33–35). Regardless,
the in vitro incubation (37jC, pH 7.4) of the three prostate cancer
cell lines with IQ2-P leads to its dephosphorylation (Table 1) in a
time-dependent manner and the formation of many fluorescent
water-insoluble IQ2-OH crystals (Table 2; Fig. 4A, Before washing ).
Most of these very large (up to 20 Am long) crystals are washed

away when the cells are rinsed in PBS and fixed in alcohol. A few
crystals, however, are often seen associated with the cells (Table 2;
Fig. 4A, After washing ). That some of these precipitated 125IQ2-OH
molecules remain cell bound was confirmed when tumor cells
were incubated with 125IQ2-P and processed by autoradiography
(Fig. 4B). No hydrolysis (no fluorescent IQ2-OH crystal formation)
was observed when human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC)
were incubated with IQ2-P (Fig. 4C) or when 125IQ2-P was incubated in medium without cells for up to 48 h. Similar findings
(minimal fluorescence or its absence) were also obtained after a
24-h incubation of normal mouse tissues (kidneys, liver, and
spleen) with IQ2-P (5). Taken together with the data showing that

(a) IQ2-P docks very favorably into PAP (Fig. 2) and is readily
hydrolyzed by PAP (Fig. 3) and (b) prostate cancer cell lines are not
known to express ALP, we hypothesize that this dephosphorylation
is mediated by PAP secreted by each of the three prostate tumor
cell lines used [LNCaP cells are known to express and secrete
endogenous PAP (36–38); PC-3 cells have been reported to have
either elevated (33, 34) or undetectable (35) levels of PAP; and
22Rv1 cells have an unknown PAP status]. If this prediction is
correct, it would indicate that all three cell lines secrete PAP.
In 1930, Warburg (39) was the first to report the remarkable
extent to which tumor cells are able to convert notable amounts of
carbohydrates into lactic acid. Until recently, it was assumed that

the intracellular pH (pHi) of tumor cells is acidic. However, it
has become apparent that the pHi is in fact either neutral or
slightly alkaline (40–42), whereas the extracellular pH (pHe) is
acidic (43, 44). Furthermore, it has also become evident that
high lactate levels, the presumed cause of the decrease in pHe,
are associated with, and a predictor of, an increase in the likelihood of metastases (45–47). Consequently, extracellular proteins,
such as secreted PAP and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
ALP, as well as therapeutic molecules unable to permeate into
cells, such as IQ2-P, are exposed to the acidic environment of
solid tumor masses. As the pH optimum for PAP is f6 (48) and
that for ALP is >9 (49), it follows that the rate of hydrolysis
for phosphorylated substrates within the interstitial fluid is likely
to be much higher in PAP-expressing tumors. In addition, the relative ALP-IQ2-P and PAP-IQ2-P binding energies and predicted K i
and IC50 values are lower for PAP (see table within Fig. 2), supporting the view that prostate cancer (i.e., PAP-expressing tumors)
may be a better candidate than ALP-expressing tumors for the
EMCIT approach.
In conclusion, using advanced computational data-mining and
modeling methods, we have identified PAP as a suitable target for
the EMCIT technology being developed in our laboratories. The
water-soluble prodrug IQ2-P has been docked in silico into the
crystal structure of PAP. The iodinated PAP substrate (125IQ2-P
and 127IQ2-P) has been synthesized. The incubation of 125IQ2-P with
PAP in solution leads to the formation of its dephosphorylated

analogue 125IQ2-OH. Similarly, the in vitro incubation of IQ2-P with
several human prostate tumor cell lines (but not normal cells)
results in the hydrolysis of this water-soluble, nonfluorescent
prodrug and the formation of water-insoluble, fluorescent IQ2-OH
crystals, many of which are attached to these prostate cancer cells.
It is our hope that these quinazolinone-based radiopharmaceuticals will eventually be developed into a novel, noninvasive method
for imaging (123I-SPECT and 124I-PET) and treating (131I) prostate
tumors and their metastases. In addition, the proposed EMCIT
approach may (a) function as a prognostic marker for the
noninvasive sensing of precancerous, cancerous, and metastatic
signatures of prostate cancers in individual patients; (b) move
meaningful intervention to a much earlier point in cancer
progression; (c) provide a technique for evaluating the early
response of individual tumors to therapy, thus facilitating selection
of effective treatment by allowing rapid identification of ineffective
treatments whose side effects might not be balanced by expected
benefits; and (d) allow detection, diagnosis, staging, and treatment
to be closely coupled.
