Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Inhibition of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) enhances tumor cell sensitivity to
ionizing radiation. It is not clear how this effect is mediated, nor whether this approach can be
applied effectively in the clinic. We previously showed that IGF-1R depletion delays repair of
radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), unlikely to be explained entirely by
reduction in homologous recombination (HR) repair. The current study tested the hypothesis that
IGF-1R inhibition induces a repair defect that involves non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ).
IGF-1R inhibitor AZ12253801 blocked cell survival and radiosensitized IGF-1R over-expressing
murine fibroblasts but not isogenic IGF-1R null cells, supporting specificity for IGF-1R. IGF-1R
inhibition enhanced radiosensitivity in DU145, PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells, comparable
to effects of ATM inhibition. AZ12253801-treated DU145 cells showed delayed resolution of
γH2AX foci, apparent within 1hr of irradiation and persisting for 24hr. In contrast, IGF-1R
inhibition did not influence radiosensitivity or γH2AX focus resolution in LNCaP-LN3 cells,
suggesting that radiosensitization tracks with the ability of IGF-1R to influence DSB repair. To
differentiate effects on repair from growth and cell survival responses, we tested AZ12253801 in
DU145 cells at sub-SF50 concentrations that had no early (≤48hr) effects on cell cycle distribution
or apoptosis induction. Irradiated cultures contained abnormal mitoses, and after 5 days IGF-1R
inhibited cells showed enhanced radiation-induced polyploidy and nuclear fragmentation,
consistent with the consequences of entry into mitosis with incompletely repaired DNA.
AZ12253801 radiosensitized DNA-PK proficient but not DNA-PK deficient glioblastoma cells,
and did not radiosensitize DNA-PK-inhibited DU145 cells, suggesting that in the context of DSB
repair, IGF-1R functions in the same pathway as DNA-PK. Finally, IGF-1R inhibition attenuated
repair by both NHEJ and HR in HEK293 reporter assays. These data indicate that IGF-1R

Introduction
Inhibition or depletion of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) enhances the
sensitivity of human tumor cells to ionizing radiation and cytotoxic drugs (1-4). Consistent
with these preclinical data, IGF-1R inhibitory drugs have shown positive effects in Phase III trials when combined with chemotherapy (5, 6). However, no such combination has yet
proven to be effective in unselected patients in the Phase III setting (7), and there been no
reports of the use of IGF-1R inhibitors with radiotherapy. If we can understand how IGF-1R
influences the response to DNA damage, it may be possible to use IGF-1R inhibitors more
effectively in the clinic.

We previously reported that IGF-1R is up-regulated in primary prostate cancers, and is
detectable in prostate cancer metastases (8). Subsequently, other groups have confirmed that
prostate cancers over-express IGF-1R (9-12). We showed that IGF-1R depletion enhances
the radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells, and delays repair of DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs; (1, 13). In mammalian cells, DSBs are repaired by non-homologous end-joining
(NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR), a high-fidelity pathway that requires a repair
template, typically a sister chromatid, available during late S and G2 phases (14). We
recently reported that the DSB repair defect in IGF-1R-depleted prostate cancer cells was
accompanied by reduction in repair by HR. This effect may have been related, at least in
part, to altered cell cycle distribution in IGF-1R depleted cells, and furthermore, the
magnitude of the DSB repair defect suggested that impairment of HR alone was unlikely to
explain the repair defect in its entirety (13). The aims of the current study were to determine
whether IGF-1R inhibition induces a similar delay in DSB repair, and if so, to quantify
repair via the major DSB repair pathways. We find that IGF-1R inhibition induces
radiosensitization that is associated with attenuation of both NHEJ and HR, and with
induction of polyploidy and late nuclear fragmentation, a phenotype that is consistent with
entry into mitosis with incompletely repaired DNA.

Results
IGF-1R inhibition radiosensitizes IGF-1R over-expressing murine fibroblasts but not
IGF-1R null cells
We investigated effects of IGF-1R inhibition using AZ12253801, an IGF-1R tyrosine kinase
inhibitor that shows ~10-fold selectivity over the insulin receptor (15, 16). Initially, to
determine whether AZ12253801 exerts its effects predominantly via IGF-1R, we used
IGF-1R–null murine fibroblasts (R− cells) and isogenic R+ cells over-expressing human

IGF-1R (Figure 1a; (17). In R+ cells, AZ12253801 blocked IGF-induced IGF-1R
phosphorylation (Figure 1b) and inhibited cell survival with SF50 (concentration that inhibits
survival to 50%) of 80nM (Figure 1c, Supplementary Figure S1). In contrast, IGF-1R null R
− cells showed negligible response to AZ12253801, and the SF50 was not achieved (Figure
1c). The differential effect of AZ12253801 in R+ and R− cells supports the contention that
the major mechanism of action of AZ12253801 is via IGF-1R inhibition. R+ cells were
significantly more radioresistant than R− cells, as previously reported (18), and were
radiosensitized by AZ12253801. In contrast, AZ12253801 did not influence radiosensitivity
of IGF-1R null R− cells (Figure 1d). It was noted that IGF-1R inhibition suppressed postirradiation survival of R+ cells to the level in R− cells, suggesting that IGF-1R expression is
the principal factor contributing to radioresistance in R+ cells.

Next, we tested effects of AZ12253801 on radiosensitivity in prostate cancer cells,
following initial characterization of IGF axis components (Figure 2a). Assessment of
intrinsic radiosensitivity indicated that DU145 cells were the most radioresistant, PC3 and
LNCaP-LN3 intermediate, and 22Rv1 more radiosensitive (Figure 2b). In DU145 cells,
AZ12253801 caused dose-dependent inhibition of IGF-1R phosphorylation that persisted for
~48hr, suppressed activation of AKT and ERKs, and inhibited cell survival with SF50 60nM
(Figure 2c-e). To address concerns that IGF-1R inhibition may not persist for the duration of
clonogenic assays, potentially underestimating the phenotype, these assays were repeated,
replacing AZ12253801 every 2 days. However, this did not increase inhibitory effects on
cell survival (not shown). We also determined AZ12253801 SF50 values in PC3, 22Rv1 and
LNCaP-LN3 cells (Table 1). In contrast to findings in isogenic R+/R− cells, there was no
correlation between radiosensitivity and IGF-1R expression or SF50 for IGF-1R inhibition,
likely because of genotypic differences between the prostate cancer cell lines (Table 1,
Figure 2a).
Radiation survival assays were performed to test effects of AZ12253801, applied at or
below the SF50 concentration for each cell line, and comparing with radiosensitization
induced by ATM inhibitor KU55933. At 30-60nM, AZ12253801 caused dose-dependent
radiosensitization of DU145 cells (Figure 2f). Indeed, effects of 60nM AZ12253801 were
comparable to radiosensitization induced by KU55933, supporting the contention that
IGF-1R inhibition has a biologically significant effect on radiation sensitivity. Assessment
of parallel DU145 cultures following IGF1R gene silencing (Figure 2g) indicated that
IGF-1R depletion and inhibition induced equivalent radiosensitization. AZ12253801 also
enhanced radiosensitivity of PC3 and 22Rv1 cells, and as in DU145, this effect was
comparable to radiosensitization induced by ATM inhibition (Table 1, Supplementary
Figure S2a, b). In contrast, LNCaP-LN3 cells showed no major change in radiosensitivity
when IGF-1R was inhibited, and neither were they radiosensitized by ATM inhibitor
KU55933 (Supplementary Figure 2c). We previously noted that IGF-1R depletion did not
radiosensitize LNCaP cells (13), speculating that this could relate to very low IGF-1R
expression or absence of the IGF-1R adaptor protein insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1,
Figure 2a; (19). However, LNCaP-LN3 was not the most radiosensitive of the cell lines we

tested (Figure 2b), suggesting that other factors may over-ride effects of low IGF-1R.
Indeed, LNCaP-LN3 cells were isolated from sequential lymph node metastases, and are
known to express high levels of anti-apoptotic (Bcl2) and low levels of pro-apoptotic (BAX,
BAK) proteins and to be resistant to apoptosis (20). These cells also express mutant PTEN,
and we noted that IGF-1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 was reported not to radiosensitize PTEN
null PC3 cells (3). However, we find that AZ12253801 induced comparable
radiosensitization in PC3 and DU145 cells, similar to effects of IGF1R gene silencing (13),
suggesting that lack of functional PTEN does not necessarily render cells refractory to the
radiosensitizing effects of IGF-1R inhibition. Collectively, these experiments support a role
for IGF-1R in mediating post-irradiation survival in 3 of 4 human prostate cancer cell lines,
and in murine fibroblasts that express IGF-1R.
IGF-1R has well-established roles in regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis,
properties that influence cell survival after irradiation (21, 22). We investigated whether
IGF-1R inhibition has any influence on the radiation response that is independent of these
well-characterized roles, and employed several strategies to limit cell cycle and apoptotic
responses to IGF-1R inhibition. Firstly, we performed experiments in DU145 cells, which
harbor mutant p53 and non-functional Rb (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk; (23), and in which we
previously demonstrated a DSB repair defect upon IGF-1R depletion (13). Secondly, we
used AZ12253801 at sub-GI50 concentrations to limit confounding effects on proliferation
and cell survival. The GI50 value for AZ12253801 is 120nM in DU145 cells (15), and so
subsequent experiments used AZ12253801 at 30-60 nM, as in R+ and R− cells.

IGFs promote transition from G1 to S and G2 to M phases of the cell cycle via up-regulation
of cyclins, enhancement of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and retinoblastoma (Rb)
protein phosphorylation, and IGF-1R inhibition induces cell cycle arrest in G1 or G2 (22,
24-27). This is relevant because intrinsic radiosensitivity varies during the cell cycle, and the
ability to utilize HR depends on cell-cycle dependent availability of a homologous template
(14, 28, 29). However, in p53 mutant, Rb null DU145 cells, 30nM AZ12253801 did not
influence cell cycle profiles in undamaged cells (Supplementary Table 1, upper;
Supplementary Figure S3a). Control-treated cells showed G2-M arrest 6-8hr after 3Gy, and
this was not altered at time-points up to 48hr post-irradiation by 30nM AZ12253801
(Supplementary Table 1, lower; Supplementary Figure S3a). Apoptosis assays revealed
apoptosis induction in cells that were AZ12253801-treated or irradiated, although the
addition of 30-60nM AZ12253801 did not further enhance irradiation-induced apoptosis at
24-48hr (Supplementary Figure 3b). These data suggest that early (≤48hr) apoptosis
induction or changes in cell cycle distribution are unlikely to make a major contribution to
radiosensitization induced by AZ12253801. Similar lack of apoptosis enhancement was
observed in colorectal cancer cells treated with IGF-1R inhibitor PQIP together with SN38,
the active metabolite of irinotecan (26).
Having found no significant differences in early (≤48hr) changes in cell cycle distribution or
apoptosis induction, we next tested whether AZ12253801 was capable of inducing relatively
late changes that could influence cell viability following irradiation. Senescence is known to
inhibit access of repair factors to DSBs via increase in heterochromatin, and there are
conflicting data on the contribution of the IGF axis to senescence induction (30-34).

However, we found no evidence that AZ12253801-induced senescence in irradiated DU145
cells (Supplementary Figure 3c), perhaps related to the absence of functional Rb or p16 in
these cells (35). Finally, radiation is known to induce mitotic catastrophe, characterized by
atypical mitoses, leading after one or more rounds of replication to appearance of polyploid
cells that may subsequently die by apoptosis (36, 37). This is distinct from apoptosis
induced soon after irradiation, which was not enhanced by IGF-1R inhibition
(Supplementary Figure 3b). Therefore, we co-stained irradiated DU145 cells for phosphohistone H3 and β-tubulin to assess mitotic fraction and spindle morphology respectively.
Undamaged control or AZ12253801-treated cells contained normal spindles with correct
chromosome segregation (Figure 3a). One day after irradiation, we detected abnormal
mitoses in both control and IGF-1R inhibited cultures, with evidence of lagging DNA
strands, aberrant spindles, and micronucleus formation. By 5 days many cells had died,
particularly following AZ12253801 treatment, and both cultures contained large cells with
large abnormal fragmented nuclei (Figure 3a). In order to quantify differences between
control and AZ12253801-treated cells, we performed flow cytometric analysis of mitotic
index (phospho-histone H3 positivity) and DNA content (Figure 3b, Table 2). IGF-1R
inhibition did not appear to induce a detectable increase in mitotic index (Table), but there
was increased polyploidy (>4N DNA content) 5 days after 10Gy irradiation, and a large
increase in nuclear fragmentation as quantified by sub-G1 fraction (Table). These data are
consistent with late triggering of apoptosis following several rounds of aberrant mitosis,
which can result from incompletely or aberrantly repaired DNA (37).
IGF-1R inhibition delays resolution of radiation-induced γH2AX

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Ionizing radiation causes a variety of DNA lesions of which DSBs are the most toxic (14).
We and others have shown that IGF-1R regulates components of the cellular response to
DNA damage, with evidence for altered repair of radiation-induced DSBs in IGF-1Rdepleted cells (1, 13, 38, 39). To investigate whether similar changes occur upon IGF-1R
inhibition, we assessed DSB induction and repair by quantifying γH2AX, the
phosphorylated form of the variant histone H2AX (40). Initial assessment by western blot
indicated that irradiated control-treated DU145 cells showed resolution of γH2AX to basal
(unirradiated) levels by 24hrs, while pre-treatment with 30nM AZ12253801 induced a delay
in the resolution of γH2AX signal that was apparent at 4 hours (p<0.01), with a similar trend
persisting 24-48hr post-irradiation (Figure 4a, b). Although our data indicated that 30nM
AZ12253801 did not appear to influence early (≤48hr) radiation-induced changes in cell
cycle distribution or apoptosis (Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Figure S3b), we
were mindful that γH2AX can be induced during S-phase and by apoptosis, in the latter case
typically forming a ring around the nuclear periphery, progressing to widespread diffuse
signal (41-43). Therefore, we also assessed γH2AX by immunofluorescence. Intense pannuclear γH2AX was detected in a minority of cells 24-48 hour post-irradiation, both in
control and AZ12253801-treated cells (Figure 4c). These appearances were consistent with
features of apoptosis; such cells were excluded from subsequent analysis, which quantified
only discrete focal γH2AX. After quantifying γH2AX foci in DU145 cells following 1-10Gy
irradiation, we selected 3Gy as a dose at which foci were induced in the linear range, and
could be accurately counted (Supplementary Figure S4a). These foci could be co-stained for
53BP1, which form rapidly at the site of DNA DSBs (44), confirming that focal γH2AX

represented DSBs (Supplementary Figure S4b). Unirradiated cells contained few γH2AX
foci (mean 2.6 ± 0.3 foci per cell in controls, 2.4 ± 0.4 in IGF-1R inhibited cells; Figure 4d),
with significant increase 1hr after irradiation, resolving in control-treated cells to basal
levels at 24hr. In cells pre-treated with 30nM AZ12253801, there was a modest but
significant excess of γH2AX foci 1hr following irradiation, with a delay in resolution that
persisted for 24hr (Figure 4e). These results were comparable with the DSB repair delay that
we detected previously in IGF-1R depleted cells by quantification of γH2AX foci and pulsed
field gel electrophoresis (13). To determine whether the increase in focus formation at 1hr
was due to increased induction or delayed resolution of damage, foci were quantified at
earlier time points. Maximal damage was apparent by 30min, with no difference between
controls and AZ12253801-treated cells, and with a subsequent delay in focus resolution
from 1hr post-irradiation (Figure 4f). These data are consistent with a DNA repair delay,
evident from early time-points after DNA damage, in IGF-1R inhibited cells.
Given that LNCaP-LN3 cells had not been radiosensitized by IGF-1R inhibition
(Supplementary Figure S2c) we also tested whether AZ1253801 influenced γH2AX focus
formation in these cells. In control-treated LNCaP-LN3 cells, focus induction and resolution
followed a time-course similar to that seen in control DU145 cells, and it was clear that
IGF-1R inhibition made no difference to this pattern (Supplementary Figure S4c). This
suggests that the ability of IGF-1R inhibition to enhance radiosensitivity tracks with its
ability to influence γH2AX focus resolution, supporting the concept that IGF-1R makes an
important contribution to radio-resistance via its impact on DSB repair.
IGF-1R inhibition attenuates repair by NHEJ

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We next investigated the molecular basis for delayed DSB repair. Previous study of murine
melanoma cells showed that IGF-1R depletion enhanced radiosensitivity and impaired ATM
kinase activity (45). In human MCF7 breast cancer cells binding is detectable between ATM
and IRS-1 (46). However, in DU145 cells, where IRS-1 is almost exclusively cytoplasmic
(13), we could not detect interaction between ATM and IGF-1R or IRS-1 (Supplementary
Figure S5a), and there was no evidence of a functional ATM defect in IGF-1R-inhibited
cells (Supplementary Figure S5b). In murine fibroblasts that express human IGF-1R, IRS-1
is reported to interact with the recombinase RAD51, influencing its ability to form damageinduced foci and to contribute to HR (38). In previous work we were unable to detect
IRS-1:RAD51 complexes, but did detect reduction in HR in IGF-1R depleted DU145 cells
(13). However, impairment of ATM or HR induce only minor defects in repair of radiationinduced DSBs, apparent at ~24hr (31, 47), and unlikely to account for the early onset repair
delay in IGF-1R-inhibited cells (Figure 4f).
In mammalian cells, rapid DSB repair is mediated principally via NHEJ (14). We employed
three strategies to investigate whether IGF-1R inhibition influences the NHEJ pathway,
assessing effects of AZ12253801 on expression of repair proteins, testing for epistasis
between IGF-1R and DNA-PK, and performing repair reporter assays. Firstly, we found no
evidence that AZ12253801 influenced levels of core NHEJ proteins in undamaged or
irradiated cells, nor could we detect changes in expression of DSB sensing and HR
components (Figure 4g). Repair protein function is not typically regulated at the level of

protein expression, but involves protein mobilization following induction of DNA damage
(48). Therefore, we next sought evidence of involvement of the IGF axis in NHEJ by testing
for functional interaction between IGF-1R and DNA-PK. M059J and M059K are human
glioblastoma cell lines established from the same tumor, M059J being deficient in the
catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) and more radiosensitive
than M059K (49). After confirming these differences in DNA-PKcs expression and intrinsic
radiosensitivity (Figure 5a, b), we tested effects of IGF-1R inhibition. AZ12253801
enhanced radiosensitivity in the more radioresistant M059K cells, but not in DNAPKcs
deficient M059J cells (Figure 5b). We noted that M059J cells expressed lower ATM levels
than M059K (Figure 5a), potentially compromising interpretation of these results. However,
this low level of ATM appeared to be functional, because ATM inhibition did radiosensitize
both M059K and M059J cells (Supplementary Figure S5c). We next performed similar
experiments in DU145 cells, testing for epistasis between IGF-1R and DNA-PK using
DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7441 (50). At 1μM, NU7441 blocked damage-induced DNA-PKcs
autophosphorylation at Ser2056 without suppressing ATM activation as judged by Chk2 and
KAP-1 phosphorylation (Figure 5c, Supplementary Figure S5d). We then used 1μM
NU7441 in combination experiments in DU145 cells. As before (Figure 2f), AZ12253801
enhanced radiosensitivity of control-treated cells, but did not influence radiosensitivity in
cells that were pre-treated with 1μM NU7441 (Figure 5d). Taken together, these data in
glioblastoma and prostate cancer cells suggest that in the context of its effect on DSB repair,
IGF-1R functions in the same pathway as DNA-PK.

Finally, we tested whether AZ12253801 induces functional impairment of repair, by
measuring re-joining of DSB repair reporters integrated into the genomic DNA of HEK293
cells. We confirmed that these cells expressed IGF-1R, and that AZ12253801 could block
IGF signalling (Figure 6a). At concentrations that we planned to use in repair assays,
AZ12253801 induced accumulation in G2 phase of the cell cycle (Supplementary Figure S6,
Table S2). In addition to integration of reporter constructs EJ5-GFP and DR-GFP that
enable quantification of total NHEJ or HR respectively, these cells also express I-SceI as a
fusion protein with flanking mutant estrogen receptor ligand binding domains (TAM),
forming the TAM-I-SceITAM (TST) fusion for inducible I-SceI activation and DSB
induction in response to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT; (51). We first tested effects of
AZ12253801 on NHEJ, given that previous results (Figure 4d, 5b, d) implicated IGF-1R in
regulation of this process. HEK293 EJ5-GFP-TST cells were treated with 4OHT and solvent
or 30nM AZ12253801, and we also used 1μM NU7441 as a control for NHEJ inhibition. In
solvent-treated controls we detected ~0.1% GFP positivity (Figure 6b), consistent with
previously-published values of 0.2% GFP-positivity in 4OHT-treated mouse ES reporter
cells and 0.05% in HEK293 cells (51). In HEK293 cells that were pre-treated with NU7441,
GFP positivity was reduced to 30 ± 6% of control levels (p<0.01), supporting the ability of
this assay to detect significant suppression of NHEJ. Rejoining of the NHEJ reporter was
also suppressed by IGF-1R inhibition, to 40 ± 5% of control levels. This was significantly
different from the solvent-control treated cells (p<0.05), but not from DNA-PK inhibited
cells. These data suggest that AZ12253801 was capable of inhibiting DSB repair by NHEJ.

Having previously reported that IGF1R gene silencing suppresses repair by HR (13), we
wanted to compare effects of IGF-1R inhibition on the two major DSB repair pathways in
this HEK293 model. However, we were unable to detect GFP positivity in HEK293 DRGFP-TST cells following 4OHT treatment (not shown). Therefore, as recommended (51),
we used transient transfection of I-SceI to increase DSB yield. This approach generated
detectable GFP positivity in control-treated cells, amounting to 5.7 ± 0.8% of EJ5-GFP
(NHEJ reporter) transfectants and 1.6 ± 0.3% of DR-GFP (HR) transfectants (Figure 6c, d).
NHEJ assays indicated that AZ12253801 induced dose-dependent inhibition of re-joining,
with reduction to 69 ± 7% and 45 ± 5% in cells treated with 30nM and 60nM AZ12253801
respectively (p<0.001 for each comparison, Figure 6c). In comparison, DNA-PK inhibition
suppressed re-joining to 26 ± 3 % of control levels (p<0.001); this effect was greater than
that achieved by 30nM but not 60nM AZ12253801. Assays in HEK293 DR-GFP cells
suggested that IGF-1R inhibition also suppressed HR, with reduction to ~65% of control
values in cells treated with 30 or 60nM AZ12253801 (p<0.05; Figure 6d). These effects
were comparable to the reduction in HR to 70% of control values we previously reported
upon IGF-1R depletion (13), and also similar to effects of CDK1 inhibition (Figure 6d),
reported to suppress HR by blocking CDK-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1 (52). These
data suggest that IGF-1R inhibition influences DSB repair by both NHEJ and HR.

Discussion

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Our data support previous findings that IGF-1R inhibition enhances sensitivity to ionizing
radiation (2-4, 39). The use of low (sub-GI50/SF50) concentrations of IGF-1R inhibitor
allowed us to distinguish effects of IGF-1R inhibition on DSB repair from other bettercharacterized phenotypes associated with IGF-1R. The results suggest that the ability of
IGF-1R to influence DSB repair does not involve senescence induction and is largely
independent of direct early effects on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis induction. This
raised the question as to whether IGF-1R-inhibited cells die post-irradiation via alternative
death mechanisms. IGF-1R inhibition was reported to induce mitotic catastrophe in a model
of triple negative breast cancer (53), although this was in combination with the microtubulestabilizing agent docetaxel that targets mitosis (54), and the IGF-1R inhibitor used for this
study, BMS-754807, is reported to have activity against aurora kinases (55), which could
contribute to this phenotype. Our data indicate that in both control and IGF-1R inhibited
DU145 cells, abnormal mitoses were detectable 24hr after irradiation. Of relevance to this
cell line model, we note that Rb loss was reported to be associated with radiation-induced
genomic instability (56). At 5 days post-irradiation, IGF-1R inhibited DU145 cells manifest
an increase in polyploidy and nuclear fragmentation compared with controls. These findings
are consistent with the consequences of entry into mitosis with unrepaired or mis-repaired
DNA damage (36, 37).
We now find direct evidence that IGF-1R inhibition induces a functional defect in DSB
repair via the NHEJ pathway. Impairment of NHEJ (Figure 6) is consistent with the
relatively large defect in DSB repair we documented previously in IGF-1R depleted cells
(13), the early delay in resolution of radiation -induced γH2AX foci in IGF-1R inhibited
DU145 cells (Figure 4d), and the demonstration of epistasis between IGF-1R and DNA-PK
in prostate cancer and glioblastoma cells (Figure 5b, d). The finding of impaired end-joining

in IGF-1R inhibited cells is novel, and the molecular basis for this effect is unclear. At
concentrations used here, AZ12253801 suppressed AKT activation (Figure 2c), and AKT
has been linked with DSB repair, reported in different models either to promote NHEJ via
DNA-PK activation, or to suppress HR and contribute to genome instability (57). IGF-1R
has been reported to regulate both the expression of Ku80 (although we did not find
evidence for this here; Figure 4g), and the ability of Ku proteins to bind double-stranded
oligonucleotides (39). IGF-1R is also reported to be strongly associated with expression of
Major Vault Protein (MVP), which is correlated with altered expression of Ku70/80 and
apoptosis regulators, and with poor outcomes after radio-chemotherapy for cervical cancer
(58, 59). Finally, we and others have described nuclear IGF-1R translocation (15, 60, 61),
raising the prospect that nuclear IGF-1R could regulate the activity of repair proteins, as
described for activation of DNA-PK by nuclear EGFR (62). However, we could not detect
interaction between IGF-1R and DNA-PKcs (Supplementary Figure S5). Furthermore,
radiosensitization was induced by AZ12253801 at concentrations below the GI50 (120nM)
that we previously showed was required to block IGF-1R nuclear import (15), suggesting
that IGF effects on NHEJ may be independent of nuclear IGF-1R.

Parallel assays testing effects of IGF-1R inhibition on DSB repair by HR are consistent with
data we generated previously using IGF1R gene silencing. HR attenuation appears unrelated
to the ability of the IGF axis to regulate cell cycle progression, given that we could detect
delayed repair using low concentrations (30-60nM) of AZ12253801 that induced negligible
early changes in cell cycle distribution (Table 2). The mitogenic effects of IGFs are
principally mediated via cyclin D1 (63), but as noted elsewhere, Rb null cells such as
DU145 do not show a proliferative response to cyclin D1 (64). It is increasingly recognized
that cell cycle regulators including cyclin D1 and CDKs play important roles in HR (64, 65),
and it is plausible that IGFs may influence the expression and/or activation of cell cycle
regulators implicated in HR, even if such effectors do not promote cell cycle progression in
the absence of Rb. Such a mechanism would not, however, explain the effect on NHEJ, and
the demonstration of impaired repair by both NHEJ and HR raises the possibility that IGFs
may regulate proteins or processes common to both pathways.
These findings have implications for the therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity of
IGF-1R inhibitors in the clinic. The involvement of IGF-1R in repair via NHEJ raises the
prospect that IGF-1R inhibition could radiosensitize normal cells in G1, potentially
enhancing dose-limiting toxicity to late-reacting tissues, although this possibility has not
deterred development of DNA-PK inhibitors as radiosensitizers for clinical use (66).
Because of uncertainty regarding toxicity, it may be preferable to assess novel
radiosensitizers in the context of palliative rather than radical radiotherapy, and/or to
perform a safety run-in phase involving escalation of the dose or duration of the biological
agent with standard radiation protocols (67).
In conclusion, these data suggest that IGF-1R inhibition suppresses DSB repair by both
NHEJ and HR, and induces biologically significant radio-sensitization of human and murine
cells. Further investigation of the molecular basis for these effects will shed light on the role
of IGF-1R, and may have implications for clinical use of IGF-1R inhibitors in combination
with radiotherapy or DNA damaging cytotoxic drugs.

Prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3 were obtained from Cancer Research UK
Laboratories (Clare Hall Hertfordshire UK), and 22Rv1 and LNCaP-LN3 from Professor Sir
Walter Bodmer (Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, UK). R− and R+ cells were
from Dr Renato Baserga (Kimmel Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA; (17). M059J and
M059K glioblastoma cells (49) were from Dr Anne Kiltie (Department of Oncology,
University of Oxford, UK). HEK-293 EJ5-GFP/TST and HEK293 DR-GFP/TST cells were
obtained from Dr Wojciech Niedzwiedz (Department of Oncology, University of Oxford,
UK) with permission from Professor Jeremy Stark (Beckman Research Institute of the City
of Hope, California; (51). See Supplemental Methods for details of cell culture.
AZ12253801 is an ATP-competitive IGF-1R inhibitor that was provided by AstraZeneca
and previously described (15). DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 was from Tocris Bioscience
(Missouri, USA) and ATM inhibitor KU55933 and CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 from
Calbiochem (UK). Compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at 5mM
(NU7441) or 10mM (AZ12253801, KU55933, RO-3306) and stored at −20°C. Gene
silencing experiments used non-silencing Allstars siRNA and IGF-1R siRNA
(Hs_IGF1R_1, Qiagen) as described (13). Cells were irradiated in a caesium-137 source
(IBL 637 irradiator, CIS Bio International, France).
Western blotting, immunoprecipitation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cells were lysed in IGF-1R lysis buffer (1%Triton-X-100; (13) or SDS lysis buffer in which
1% SDS replaced Triton-X-100. SDS lysates were sonicated on ice for 10sec continuously
at maximum output (Sonopuls GM70, Bandelin, Germany). Lysates were analyzed by SDS
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) and western blotting, using antibodies
listed in Supplemental Methods. Immunoprecipitation was performed on precleared lysates
prepared in IGF-1R lysis buffer as described (13) using antibodies to IGF-1R (#3027, Cell
Signaling Technology, CST), IRS-1 (IRS-1 (#2382, CST) or irrelevant control (rabbit IgG,
Sigma), for analysis by SDS PAGE and western blotting.
Assays for cell survival, apoptosis and senescence
Clonogenic assays were performed as in (13), using cells that were treated with solvent or
drug(s), and after 4hr irradiated. This 4hr -pre-treatment was used to ensure that target
inhibition was established prior to irradiation, based on time-course experiments (Figure 2d).
For apoptosis assays, cells were seeded in black 96-well plates, and the following day
treated and/or irradiated as above. Caspase 3/7 activity was quantified using Apo-ONE
Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assays (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 499nm and 521nm
respectively on a FLUOstar Optima fluorescence plate reader (BMG LabTech, Germany).
After subtracting background fluorescence generated by medium without cells, fluorescence
was expressed as % increase over solvent-treated control values [(treated- solvent)/ solvent
× 100]. The Senescence Beta Galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signalling) was used
according to the manufacturers recommendations. Briefly, cells were fixed with 20%
formaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, washed with PBS, and incubated overnight at 37°C with

Flow cytometry

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cells were treated with solvent or AZ12253801, after 4hr irradiated, at intervals fixed in ice
cold 80% ethanol with vortexing, and stored at −20°C. Cells were re-hydrated in PBS with
1% BSA (PBSB), centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature, resuspended in
PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100, and incubated on ice for 10mins. After centrifugation, cells
were washed with PBSB, resuspended in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 30min
with 10μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 100μg/ml RNAse prior to analysis. Cells were
analyzed for mitotic index and ploidy as described (68) by staining with phospho-S10
histone H3 antibody (#ab5176 Abcam) and PI. Samples were analysed on a CyAn ADP
Analyzer (Beckman-Coulter, UK) with FlowJo 7.6.5 software (www.flowjo.com).
Immunofluorescence
Cells were cultured on coverslips, irradiated and/or inhibitor treated, and fixed and stained
as described (13) using primary antibodies to γH2AX (#2577, CST) phospho-S10 histone
H3 (#ab5176 Abcam), β-tubulin (#T4026, Sigma), 53BP1 (#NB100-304, Novus
Biologicals) and phospho-S2056 DNA-PKcs (#ab18192, Abcam), with Alexa Fluor 488 or
594 - conjugated anti-mouse and/or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Invitrogen Molecular
Probes). Coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) with 2μg/ml
4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dilactate (DAPI) and foci were imaged and counted on an
Axioskop 2 Zeiss microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd., UK).
DNA repair reporter assays

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

HEK293 reporter assays were performed as described (51), treating cells with solvent or
small molecule inhibitors together with 3μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT). After 24hr, the
medium was replaced with fresh medium containing inhibitor without 4OHT. After a further
48hr cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS and resuspended in PBS for
flow cytometry. Some assays used HEK293 cells seeded onto poly-L-lysine coated plates
and transiently transfected the following day using Fugene HD (Promega) with pCMV-Sce
and pDsRed2-Mito, or with eGFP cDNA or pDsRed2-Mito alone as controls for gating, as
described (13). Four hours later, cells were treated with inhibitors, and after 72hr fixed for
quantification of red and green fluorescence by flow cytometry.
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism v5 (GraphPad Software Inc, USA), using t-tests
to determine differences between two groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
three or more groups, and two-way ANOVA for trends between response curves.
