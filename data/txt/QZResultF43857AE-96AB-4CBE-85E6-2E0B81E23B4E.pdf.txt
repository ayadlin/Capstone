ABSTRACT
Inhibition of the p16INK4a/cyclin D/CDK4/6/RB pathway is an effective
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast
cancer. Although efficacious, current treatment regimens require a dosing holiday due
to severe neutropenia potentially leading to an increased risk of infections, as well
as tumor regrowth and emergence of drug resistance. Therefore, a next generation
CDK4/6 inhibitor that can inhibit proliferation of CDK4/6-dependent tumors while
minimizing neutropenia could reduce both the need for treatment holidays and the
risk of inducing drug resistance.
Here, we describe the preclinical characterization and development of G1T38;
a novel, potent, selective, and orally bioavailable CDK4/6 inhibitor. In vitro, G1T38
decreased RB1 (RB) phosphorylation, caused a precise G1 arrest, and inhibited
cell proliferation in a variety of CDK4/6-dependent tumorigenic cell lines including
breast, melanoma, leukemia, and lymphoma cells. In vivo, G1T38 treatment led
to equivalent or improved tumor efficacy compared to the first-in-class CDK4/6
inhibitor, palbociclib, in an ER+ breast cancer xenograft model. Furthermore, G1T38
accumulated in mouse xenograft tumors but not plasma, resulting in less inhibition
of mouse myeloid progenitors than after palbociclib treatment. In larger mammals,
this difference in pharmacokinetics allowed for 28 day continuous dosing of G1T38 in
beagle dogs without producing severe neutropenia. These data demonstrate G1T38
has unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, which result in high
efficacy against CDK4/6 dependent tumors while minimizing the undesirable on-target
bone marrow activity, thus potentially allowing G1T38 to be used as a continuous,
daily oral antineoplastic agent.

maintain functional RB but have aberrations that increase
the activity of CDK4/6, which hyper-phosphorylates RB
and allows cell proliferation [1, 2]. As such, CDK4/6
appears to be a key enzyme necessary for the proliferation
of human cancers that have functional RB.
Cell cycle progression begins with the commitment to
transition from the G1 phase to the S phase; this restriction

INTRODUCTION
In normal cells, the cyclin D/CDK4/6/p16INK4a/
RB pathway allows for the orderly control of cell cycle
progression for cell growth and proliferation. While the
cyclin D/CDK4/6/p16INK4a/RB pathway is frequently
disrupted in cancer, the majority of human neoplasms

point is regulated through RB. In the absence of a growth
signal, RB inhibits the activation of genes required for S
phase transition [1, 2]. Growth signals activate CDK4/6,
which phosphorylates and deactivates RB, thus activating
S phase-specific genes that stimulate cell cycle progression
from the G1 phase to the S phase [3]. Further, inhibiting
CDK4/6 activity has the potential to be therapeutically
beneficial in a wide variety of tumors with functional RB.
There are numerous ways in which cancers with
functional RB enhance CDK4/6 activity allowing for
deregulated proliferation. One of the most common
events is the inactivation of p16INK4a, a tumor suppressor
that inhibits CDK4/6 activity. Inactivation of p16INK4a may
occur via mutations, deletion, or epigenetic silencing,
which is observed in a significant portion of non-small
cell lung cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and
mesothelioma [4–8].
Moreover, a specific mutation of the CDK4 gene
(CDKR24C) that confers resistance to p16 INK4a binding has
been shown to play a causal role in rare cases of familial
melanoma, suggesting that unchecked CDK4 activity is a
key event in these cancers [9]. Translocation or amplification
of D-type cyclin genes that lead to increased CDK4/6 activity
are found in the majority of mantle cell lymphomas and in
many cases of multiple myeloma [10, 11]. Amplification of
cyclin D1 and overexpression of the protein have also been
reported in approximately 50% of squamous cell esophageal
cancers and in 20% to 30% of breast cancers [12–14].
Specifically, the profiling of a breast cancer cell line panel
with palbociclib, a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor, demonstrated
that CDK4/6 inhibitors are exquisitely effective at inhibiting
the growth of ER+ cells [15].
Additionally, many of the receptor-mediated growth
pathways that are activated in human cancers increase
D-type-cyclin transcription and expression to drive
cellular proliferation [16, 17]. Other activating aberrations
of mitogen pathways such as V600E B-Raf in the mitogen
activated protein kinase pathway and phosphatase and
tensin homolog deletions in the phosphatidylinositol3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase (PTEN) pathway also
increase D-type-cyclins to achieve unchecked proliferation
[18, 19]. Furthermore, the genes encoding CDK4 and
CDK6 are amplified in a subset of human neoplasms.
The CDK4 gene is amplified in 100% of liposarcomas,
while CDK6 is frequently amplified in T-lymphoblastic
lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia [20, 21].
Finally, there is increasing evidence the E2Finduced cyclin/CDK hyperactivity in prostate cancer
is an ideal target for CDK4/6 inhibition [22]. Androgen
receptor dependent upregulation of D-type-cyclins
leading to activation of the cyclin D1/CDK4/6 complex
and proliferation in prostate cancer cells suggests that
targeting this axis may be effective in castration resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC). Utilizing CRPC models, G1T38
was observed to have equivalent anti-tumor activity to the
standard of care, docetaxel. [Stice JP, Wardell SE, Norris,
JD et al., in press].

The abundance of mechanisms by which
transformed cells can deregulate CDK4/6 activity
suggests this enzyme is crucial for cancer pathogenesis
and inhibiting CDK4/6 activity has the potential to be
therapeutically beneficial.
In February 2015, the first selective CDK4/6
inhibitor, palbociclib, was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to be used in combination with
letrozole as initial endocrine-based therapy for the treatment
of postmenopausal women with ER+, human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative advanced or
metastatic breast cancer. In February 2016, palbociclib was
approved in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment
of women with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast
cancer with disease progression following endocrine therapy.
Although palbociclib is efficacious, daily treatment causes
severe neutropenia, which necessitates a 21-day on/7-day
off schedule to allow for recovery of neutrophil counts [23,
24]. The palbociclib-induced neutropenia may lead to an
increased risk of infections and the treatment holiday may
lead to the potential for tumor regrowth and emergence of
drug resistance. This CDK4/6 dependent on-target effect
on HSPC proliferation has been described previously [25,
26], whereby early hematopoietic progenitor cells in the
presence of palbociclib are maintained in a G1 arrested state
until released. Continuous exposure decreases myelogenesis
leading to myelosuppression, which is reversible. Thus, it
may be advantageous to develop a next generation CDK4/6
inhibitor that can inhibit cell proliferation in CDK4/6dependent tumors while minimizing effects on the bone
marrow, thereby reducing the need for treatment holidays
and decreasing the risk of inducing drug resistance.
Here we describe the preclinical development
of G1T38: a novel, oral, potent and selective inhibitor
of CDK4/6 that inhibits RB phosphorylation in
vitro and in vivo. G1T38 is shown to possess unique
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties,
which may enable a continuous dosing regimen. By
minimizing undesirable on-target myelosuppression,
G1T38 may obviate the need for a treatment holiday.
G1T38 has recently been tested in a phase 1a, healthy
volunteer pharmacokinetics and safety study (G1T38-01,
NCT02821624). We are currently evaluating G1T38 (in
combination with Faslodex) in a Phase 1b/2a trial in ER+,
HER2- breast cancer patients (G1T38-02, NCT02983071).

RESULTS
Identification of G1T38
We have previously reported on a novel kinase
inhibitor scaffold and the discovery of trilaciclib (G1T28),
an IV, short-acting, potent and selective inhibitor of CDK4/6
currently in clinical development to preserve HSPC and
immune system function during chemotherapy [27].
Further development of the tricyclic lactam scaffold has
produced a number of oral, potent and selective CDK4/6

Biochemical profiling of G1T38 in Nanosyn, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA) kinase screen for CDKs. The assays were completed using

inhibitors with excellent drug like properties. G1T38,
2'-((5-(4-isopropylpiperazin-1-yl)pyridin-2-yl)amino)-7',
8'dihydro-6'Hspiro[cyclohexane1,9' pyrazino[1',2':1,5]
pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin]-6'-one di-hydrochloride (Figure
1A), was selected as a candidate oral antineoplastic
agent with ideal physicochemical and pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties. G1T38 is highly
potent and selective for CDK4/cyclin D1 and CDK6/
cyclin D3 over CDK1, CDK2, CDK5 and CDK7 and their
respective binding partners (Table 1).
To determine kinase selectivity beyond the cyclinCDK family, we completed a screen of 468 protein kinases
(KINOMEscan, DiscoveRx) at 100 nmol/ L and 1 μmol/L,
which represents profiling at 100 and 1000 times the
biochemical IC50 of G1T38. Results in Figure 1B show
a high degree of selectivity at 100 nmol/L at an s-score
of 1 (Figure 1B, left) and an s-score of 10 (Figure 1B,
right). Protein kinases with off-target activity showing
inhibition greater than 90% at 100 nmol/L were followed
up for Kd determination (Supplementary Table 1). Within
the CDK family, G1T38 is least selective against CDK9/
cyclin T; ~30 fold between CDK4/cyclin D1 and CDK9/
cyclin T at the biochemical IC50. The phosphorylation of
RNA polymerase II (RPB1) CTD (SER2) was measured
via immunoblot to determine whether G1T38 has a
biological inhibitory effect on CDK9/cyclin T function.
Results show that there is no loss of RPB1 CTD (SER2)
phosphorylation in the presence of G1T38 (Supplementary
Figure 1). Other targets demonstrating low Kd IC50 values
include ULK2, an inducer of autophagy and NEK10,
which is associated with G2/M arrest in response to UV
irradiation. The effect of G1T38 on NEK10 and ULK2
is an area of interest being further assessed as part of the
investigation of this molecule.

cells, the compound had no effect on the percentage of
S-phase cells (as shown by arrow in Supplementary Figure
1). A dose dependent increase of cells in the G1 phase of
the cell cycle was observed when CDK4/6 dependent
WM2664 cells were treated with G1T38 for 24 hours
(Figure 1C). This arrest was maintained through 300
nM, more than 300x the biochemical IC50. Additionally,
both CDK4/6-dependent cell lines (HS68 and WM2664)
had similar reductions in the S-phase population with
concomitant increases in G1 arrested cells without a sub2N
fraction demonstrating that G1T38 was not cytotoxic at
the concentrations tested (Supplementary Figure 2). The
CDK4/6-independent cell line (A2058) was not affected
by treatment with G1T38.
The CDK4/cyclin D1 and CDK6/cyclin D3
complexes are essential for progression from the G1 to
the S-phase of the cell cycle through phosphorylation
of the tumor suppressor, RB. Once phosphorylated, RB
dissociates from cell cycle-promoting transcription factors,
allowing them to drive the G1 to S-phase transition [28].
Therefore, CDK4/6 inhibition of RB phosphorylation will
arrest cells in G1. To assess the effect of G1T38 on RB
phosphorylation, WM2664 cells were treated with varying
doses of G1T38 for 24 hours. After treatment, cells were
harvested and phosphorylation of RB at the Ser807/811
sites was evaluated via immunoblotting. Phosphorylation
of RB at Ser807/811 sites first requires binding of CDK4/6
[3] in order to progress into S-phase [3]. WM2664 cells
treated with 30-1000 nM of G1T38 for 24 hours exhibited
a complete inhibition of RB phosphorylation compared
to vehicle controls (Figure 1D). To determine the kinetics
of CDK4/6 inhibition on RB phosphorylation, WM2664
cells were treated with 300 nM G1T38 for 1, 4, 8, 16,
and 24 hours. As shown in Figure 1E, treatment with
G1T38 reduced RB phosphorylation within 1 hour posttreatment and generated near complete inhibition of RB
phosphorylation by 16 hours post-treatment. Taken together,
these data demonstrate G1T38 potently and completely
inhibits phosphorylation of RB within 24 hours of exposure.
To assess the capacity of G1T38 to inhibit
proliferation of tumor cell lines, a broad panel of CDK4/6
dependent and independent lines was evaluated using
CellTiter Glo (Table 2). The wide range of tumor lines
was chosen to determine if G1T38 could globally inhibit
proliferation via CDK4/6. G1T38 produced a robust

Next, we assessed the ability of G1T38 to elicit a
G1 arrest in normal and tumorigenic CDK4/6-dependent
(HS68, WM2664, respectively) and -independent
tumorigenic (A2058) cell lines. G1T38 produced a robust
and sustained G1 arrest in CDK4/6 dependent cells with an

inhibition of proliferation in a diverse array of tumor
cell lines including breast, melanoma, leukemia and
lymphoma with EC50 concentrations as low as 23 nM.
Furthermore, G1T38-associated inhibition in CDK4/6independent cell lines was greater than 2.5 μM (>2500x
IC50) demonstrating a functional retinoblastoma pathway
is essential for G1T38 activity.

Compound concentrations were measured in plasma
and tumors from tumor-bearing mice given a single oral
dose of G1T38 (100 mg/kg). Based on exposure, G1T38
concentrations were 17-fold higher in the tumor compared
to plasma (Figure 2A). The tumor drug concentration was
>100 fold that of plasma at 24 hours and ~65 ng/ml of
drug remained in the tumor at 48 hours while no drug
was detectable in the plasma at this time. To assess the
effects of G1T38 on pRB, tumors were harvested and
pRB was analyzed by immunoblotting. Phosphorylated
RB decreased 30% and 98% relative to the control at 1
hour and 24 hours post-treatment, respectively (Figure
2B). The phosphorylation of RB began to rebound by

36 hours post-treatment and was approximately 31% of
control levels at 48 hours post-treatment. The time course
of pRB inhibition closely paralleled drug concentrations
in the tumor but not the plasma as inhibition of pRB was
maintained in the tumor hours after G1T38 was cleared
from the plasma. These data suggest oral G1T38 has
sufficient mouse PK/PD for assessing efficacy in tumor
models.

[29]. To assess the antineoplastic effect of G1T38 in this
model, mice were given 100 mg/kg of G1T38 in their
diet for 28 days with tumor measurements at treatment
initiation and every 3 to 4 days during treatment. As
shown in Figure 3A, mice treated with G1T38 elicited
38% tumor regression after 21 days of treatment while
control animals had a 577% increase in tumor burden over
the same treatment period, demonstrating that G1T38 is
highly efficacious in this HER2+ breast cancer model.
Next, the ER+ MCF7 xenograft model was utilized
to assess efficacy of G1T38 relative to the first-in-class
CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib. Mice were given once daily
doses of G1T38, palbociclib, or vehicle by oral gavage at
10, 50, or 100 mg/kg for 28 days. Tumors were measured
every 3 to 4 days during treatment for up to 20 days posttreatment. Compared to the vehicle-treated mice, daily

treatment with 100 mg/kg of G1T38 or palbociclib showed
tumor regression within 10 days in the MCF7 xenograft
model (Figure 3B). After 27 days of treatment, tumor
growth inhibition (TGI) was observed in the 10, 50, and
100 mg/kg G1T38 cohorts (approximately 12%, 74%, and
90% inhibition, respectively); these data demonstrate that
G1T38 can substantially inhibit cell growth in CDK4/6dependent tumors in vivo. Daily oral palbociclib treatment
caused an 18%, 66%, and 87% tumor growth inhibition in
the 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg dosage cohorts, respectively.
Interestingly, at 50 mg/kg, G1T38 was significantly more
efficacious than palbociclib. Similar results were seen in
the ER+ ZR-75-1 breast cancer xenograft model when
comparing G1T38 and palbociclib at the 50 mg/kg dose
(Supplementary Figure 3).

As the only approved selective estrogen receptor
degrader (SERD), fulvestrant is administered monthly
through intramuscular (IM) injection due to its poor oral
bioavailability. For this reason, combination therapy
with an orally bioavailable SERD is highly desirable.
We assessed the combination of G1T38 with GW5638,
a non-commercialized orally available SERD, in the
MCF7 model. Here, mice were treated with G1T38
at 25 or 50 mg/kg alone, GW5638 at 25 mg/kg alone
or in combination with G1T38 (Figure 4B). As single
agents, there was modest TGI in this model, however,
the combination of G1T38 and GW5638 led to sustained
tumor regression confirming that G1T38 in combination
with an orally available SERD increased efficacy in
ER+ breast cancer potentially obviating the need for IMadministered fulvestrant.

G1T38 increases efficacy when combined with
multiple targeted therapies in ER+ breast cancer

G1T38 increases efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in
ER+ breast cancer xenograft model

Currently, palbociclib is the only approved
CDK4/6 inhibitor and is indicated for ER+ breast cancer
in combination with letrozole or fulvestrant. To evaluate
the antitumor efficacy of G1T38 in combination with
endocrine therapy, the ER+ breast MCF7 xenograft
model was utilized. Mice were treated with 50 mg/
kg G1T38, 20 mg/kg tamoxifen, or 5 mg fulvestrant,
alone, or combinations of G1T38 + tamoxifen or G1T38
+ fulvestrant. After 28 days of treatment, G1T38 +
tamoxifen or G1T38 + fulvestrant were significantly more
effective than any single agent (G1T38, tamoxifen, or
fulvestrant) alone (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the G1T38
combination treatment with either agent resulted in a near
complete, sustained tumor regression.

Targeting the PI3K/AKT axis has been shown
to provide an anti-proliferative effect through the
reduction of AKT phosphorylation in ER+ breast cancer
[30]. Preclinical studies have shown that targeting both
the CDK4/6 and the PI3K signaling pathways results
in tumor regression and reversal of PI3K inhibitor
resistance in a MCF7 xenograft model [31]. To assess
the effect of combining G1T38 with a PI3K inhibitor,
we utilized the MCF7 xenograft model. A commercially
available inhibitor of PI3kα/δ, GDC0941, was used
for this study. Here, mice were treated with G1T38
at 25 or 50 mg/kg, alone, GDC0941 at 100 mg/kg
alone, or in combination. Results show there is modest

25 gm mice eat 3.2 gm per day; these parameters were based on previous experience. After 21 days, tumor progression was calculated using

G1T38 and GDC0941 leads to greater efficacy than any
of the treatments alone (Figure 4C). These data support
combination therapy with G1T38 and a PI3K inhibitor in
ER+ breast cancer.

NSCLC tumors [32]. To evaluate the efficacy of G1T38 in
NSCLC, PDX tumor-bearing mice (CTG-0159: stage III
primary squamous cell carcinoma, EGFRWT) were treated
once daily with oral G1T38 at 100 mg/kg for 28 days.
Tumors were measured every 3-4 days up to 30 days post
treatment. After 28 days of treatment, G1T38 treated mice
exhibited 77% TGI with an overall 60% tumor growth
delay demonstrating G1T38 alone is highly efficacious in
this NSCLC tumor model (Figure 4D).
To evaluate the efficacy of G1T38 in combination with
EGFR inhibitors, the H1975 xenograft model was utilized.
H1975 is a human NSCLC that harbors the EGFRL585R/T709M
mutations rendering resistance to erlotinib treatment [33].

vehicle or erlotinib (70 mg/kg daily) treated mice. G1T38
treatment as a single agent caused dose dependent TGI after
50 and 100 mg/kg daily oral dosing (33.3% and 60.7%,
respectively) by 18 days of treatment. Unexpectedly, when
100 mg/kg G1T38 was combined with 70 mg/kg erlotinib
for 18 days, there was 80% TGI when compared to vehicle
treated cohorts (Figure 4E) demonstrating that combination
therapy has greater efficacy than single agent therapy.
Interestingly, when G1T38, at any dose, was combined with
a 70 mg/kg dose of erlotinib, the resistance to the erlotinib
was reversed suggesting the addition of GIT38 reverses the
EGFR inhibitor resistance.
Afatinib is an irreversible second generation panErbB inhibitor developed as a first-line treatment of
patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors harbor
EGFR mutations or deletions as well as in patients with
metastatic disease that progressed after platinum-based
chemotherapy [34]. In the H1975 xenograft model, tumors
treated in combination with G1T38 (50 or 100 mg/ kg) and
afatinib (20 mg/ kg) did not develop resistance during the
18 days of treatment (Figure 4F). However, within 14 days
of treatment, the afatinib, only, cohort began to regrow
suggesting the addition of G1T38 to an afatinib regimen
can increase the time to resistance of the EGFR inhibitor
in NSCLC.

progenitor proliferation in any treatment cohort when
compared to vehicle, while palbociclib treatment led to
more than a 50% reduction in proliferation in both the 50
and 100 mg/kg cohorts (Figure 5B). These data indicate
that between doses, the longer exposure of palbociclib
resulted in drug concentrations that were above the
threshold necessary to maintain G1 arrest of bone
marrow progenitor cells resulting in sustained inhibition
of myeloid progenitors. In contrast, due to the minimal
G1T38 compound in the plasma at 24 hours, the bone
marrow seem to have more time to recover from CDK4/6
inhibition between doses suggesting that continuous daily
dosing may be achievable in cancer patients.
To compare the effects of G1T38 and palbociclib
on neutrophils during daily treatment, neutrophils were
measured at Days 0, 14, and 28. As shown in Figure 5C,
a dose-dependent decrease in neutrophils was observed
with maximal effect in the 100 mg/kg G1T38 cohort with
a 48% decrease in neutrophils demonstrated after 28 days
of once daily oral dosing. The decrease in neutrophils was
similar in the palbociclib-treated cohorts (Figure 5C).
Thus, it appears the difference between palbociclib and
G1T38 inhibition of myeloid progenitors in murine bone
marrow is not sufficient to further reduce the number of
circulating neutrophils. Therefore, in mice, the therapeutic
index (TI) (the difference between tumor efficacy and
neutropenia) for dosing G1T38 and palbociclib appears
similar. To confirm, an Emax model was generated to
compare neutrophil counts to tumor efficacy in both
G1T38 and palbociclib treated cohorts. As shown in
Figure 5D, there is a close correlation between G1T38 and
palbociclib suggesting that both drugs equally affect tumor
proliferation and neutrophil counts, confirming there is no
difference in the TI in mice.
However, in GLP 28-day toxicology studies in
beagle dogs, neutrophils decreased rapidly in a dose
dependent manner during the first 14 days of G1T38
treatment. However, from 14 to 25 days, cells reached
a steady state level, which was readily reversible once
dosing was stopped (Figure 5E). While the decrease in
neutrophil count was higher as the dose increased, the
neutrophil count at each dose level did not decrease further
once the nadir level was achieved at 14 days. These data
suggest that continuous daily dosing, without a break, may
be achievable in cancer patients.

Rapid clearance of G1T38 from plasma versus
palbociclib leads to reduced myelosuppression in
murine bone marrow
To better understand the relationship of CDK4/6
inhibition and neutropenia, C57BL/6 mice were treated for
7 days with G1T38 or palbociclib at 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg.
After 7 days of daily oral dosing, palbociclib concentrations
in plasma 24 hours after the final dose were ~300 ng/ml
(approximately 600 nM; Figure 5A). This is significantly
higher than the concentration necessary to inhibit cellular
proliferation in most RB-dependent cell lines tested (Table
2). In contrast, G1T38 plasma concentrations at 24 hours
after the last dose were 11 ng/ml (approximately 22 nM);
well below the concentration necessary to maintain a G1
arrest. This suggests that palbociclib-induced neutropenia
may be due to accumulation of the drug resulting in
persistent inhibition of CDK4/6 in the bone marrow, thus
preventing the recovery of bone marrow proliferation prior
to subsequent doses.
To evaluate whether higher palbociclib exposures
account for a more sustained inhibitory effect on the
hematopoietic system than G1T38, mice were treated
with various doses of G1T38 or palbociclib for 7 days
and proliferation of the myeloid progenitor lineage
was measured 12 hours post-treatment via 5-ethynyl2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, a time point
where previous experiments demonstrate bone marrow
proliferation nadirs after a single dose of either compound.
G1T38-treated mice showed no differences in myeloid

DISCUSSION
The therapeutic importance of CDK4/6 as a target
has been established by palbociclib (IBRANCE®), a firstin-class CDK4/6 inhibitor, which is approved for the
treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human
epidermal receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer
in combination with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole,
or the SERD, fulvestrant [35]. Although palbociclib
has proven efficacious, daily treatment causes severe

neutropenia, which necessitates a 7-day treatment holiday
[23, 24]. Palbociclib-induced neutropenia may lead to
an increased risk of infections and the treatment holiday
may lead to tumor outgrowth and emergence of drug
resistance. Therefore, a next generation CDK4/6 inhibitor
should inhibit CDK4/6-dependent tumor growth while
minimizing neutropenia, thereby reducing the need for
treatment holidays and decreasing the risk of inducing
drug resistance.
Here, we have identified and characterized G1T38;
a potent and highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor with
antiproliferative activity in CDK4/6- dependent cells and
tumors. Biochemical profiling against the CDK family
showed G1T38 was most potent on CDK4/ cyclin D1
(1 nM), CDK6/ cyclin D3 (2 nM) and CDK9/ cyclin T
(28 nM). G1T38 was >1000 fold selective for CDK4/
cyclin D1 than CDK2/cyclin E and CDK2/cyclin A.
When profiled against a broader panel of kinases, G1T38
was highly selective against the majority of kinases. We
investigated whether G1T38 might be affecting pathways
regulated through CDK9 inhibition, but did not see an
effect on RNA polymerase II. Interestingly, G1T38 is
highly potent against FLT3 (D835V) and FLT3 (ITD,
D835V) while not against FLT3 wild type protein. While
high levels of wild-type expression is observed in acute
myelogenous leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, the mutant forms are manifested as leukemic
driver mutations resulting in uncontrolled receptor
activation and are associated with negative outcome [36].
We did not observe a FLT3 specific effect on myelogenesis
with G1T38 outside the CDK4/6 inhibitory effect on
bone marrow. In WM2664 cells, G1T38 produced a dose
dependent G1 arrest with an EC50= 20 nM. This G1 arrest
was maintained through at least 300 nM. The G1 arrest
was concomitant with inhibition of pRB. However, in
cells where the RB pathway was disrupted, G1T38 had
no cell cycle effect through 2.5 μM demonstrating that
the G1 arrest was specific for CDK4/6-dependent cells.
Additionally, G1T38 was not toxic to the cells, as we
observed no decrease in cell proliferation, morphological
change or increase in sub 2N in cell populations where the
RB pathway was disrupted.
G1T38 has a relatively short plasma half-life with
minimal accumulation upon repeat dosing. In tumor bearing
mice, we found that while G1T38 was readily cleared
from the plasma, it appeared to accumulate in tumors. We
found that the concentrations of G1T38 in tumors closely
correlated with inhibition of tumor pRB, demonstrating that
G1T38 in the tumor could inhibit the CDK4/6/RB pathway
and sustain tumor cell growth inhibition after G1T38 plasma
concentrations were <1 ng/ml. Assuming the bone marrow
compartment has similar drug concentrations to circulating
drug in the plasma, the differential drug concentrations in the
bone marrow and tumor could allow for a larger TI. These
unique PK/PD properties may allow for continuous daily
dosing in the clinic

Previously, we reported palbociclib significantly
inhibited HER2+ tumor growth in the MMTV-HER2-neu
GEMM when orally dosed for 28 days [29]. Here, we
found that G1T38 was highly efficacious in this model
demonstrating that G1T38 and palbociclib are equally
effective as single agents and confirming that HER2+
tumors are sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition. Studies
comparing G1T38 to palbociclib in a human ER+ mouse
xenograft model demonstrate equivalent or better single
agent efficacy (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 3).
When comparing the plasma exposures of G1T38 and
palbociclib to efficacy (% TGI) in a nonlinear regression
model, G1T38 had a 3.8 fold lower EC50 than palbociclib
(Supplementary Figure 4). This most likely reflects both
the greater biochemical and cellular potency of G1T38
(IC50=1 nM vs. IC50 =10 nM for palbociclib; G1T38
EC50=2-3 fold < palbociclib) and difference in PK
properties of the compounds.
Preclinical studies have generally shown that
CDK4/6 inhibitors have greater efficacy when given in
combination with various growth signaling inhibitors
(GSI) [37]. Likewise, in clinical studies, combination
therapies targeting CDK4/6 and ER signaling pathways
have been shown to significantly increase progression free
survival [38, 39]. Thus, further development of CDK4/6
inhibitors will most likely be done in combination with
GSIs. In multiple combination studies targeting CDK4/6,
ER, and PI3K pathways in human ER+ mouse xenograft
models, G1T38 was significantly more efficacious when
combined with the GSI then as a single agent (Figure
4). In most of these studies, tumors began proliferating
within a few days once dosing was stopped. However,
the combination of G1T38 with GW5638, fulvestrant or
tamoxifen was particularly efficacious and TGI persisted
for several weeks once dosing was stopped. Furthermore,
the addition of G1T38 increased the efficacy of an antiestrogen treatment independent of G1T38 dose (Figure
4B). These data suggest lower doses of CDK4/6 inhibitors
and GSIs could be used in combination to decrease
toxicity while remaining highly efficacious.
In NSCLC, combination studies targeting CDK4/6
and EGFR signaling also showed increased efficacy when
compared to single agent therapy. In fact, the combination
of G1T38 (50 mg/kg) and erlotinib was equally efficacious
as the G1T38 (100 mg/kg) alone cohort. Interestingly,
G1T38 also reversed erlotinib-resistance. While it has
been previously shown that JAK2 inhibition re-sensitizes
NSCLC to EGFR inhibitors and G1T38 inhibits JAK2,
the IC50 was >500 nm; a concentration that is too
high for any biological relevance [40]. Additionally,
upregulation of AXL leads to EGFR inhibitor resistance
in NSCLC causing activation of MAPK, AKT and NFkB
pathways [41]. CDK4/6 inhibition has been shown to
affect signaling in all three pathways [42–44] suggesting
a possible mechanism whereby G1T38 reverses the
resistance of erlotinib in EGFR mutant NSCLC.

As we have previously shown that bone marrow
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are CDK4/6
dependent [He S, Roberts PJ, Sorrentino JA, et al., in
press]. Thus, the neutropenia observed in the clinic with
CDK4/6 inhibitors is a consequence of the on-target effect
of prolonged drug exposure, which has resulted in dosing
regimens that require at least a 7-day treatment holiday to
allow recovery of neutrophils. These studies also indicate
a narrow TI between tumor efficacy and neutropenia. This
is most likely due to the long half-life and accumulation of
palbociclib with repeat dosing. Thus drug exposure may be
prolonged above the threshold to maintain arrest of bone
marrow myeloid progenitors, resulting in more severe
neutropenia. In fact, palbociclib has a half-life of >24 hours
in humans with a median accumulation ratio of 2.4 (range
1.5-4.2) [35]. To better address the narrow TI, G1T38 was
designed to have minimal accumulation on repeat dosing
while maintaining tumor efficacy. In mice, the effects of
G1T38 and palbociclib on neutrophils were similar and
reflected the nearly identical elimination half-lives of these
compounds. However, unlike G1T38, sustained plasma
concentrations of palbociclib at 24 hours after administration
caused a decrease in myeloid progenitors, i.e., a more
sensitive target population than circulating neutrophils.
The minor difference observed in mouse PK and myeloid
progenitors appears to be exacerbated in larger mammals
leading to longer half-lives, accumulation of drug, and
increased sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition (Supplementary
Table 2). The toxicity of palbociclib was only evaluated for
21 days in repeat dose GLP toxicology studies in rat and
dog, rather than the standard 28-day studies [45], whereas,
G1T38 was assessed in 28-day repeat-dose GLP toxicity
studies in rat and dog. With oral administration of G1T38,
anticipated reduction of bone marrow cellularity and
lymphocyte depletion was observed leading to dose-related
decreases in hematopoiesis. However, at clinically relevant
doses, these effects were not sufficient to limit dosing to
less than 28 days. There were no reported increases in the
incidence of infection or bleeding throughout dosing and
inhibition of hematopoiesis was found to be reversible upon
discontinuing dosing of G1T38 during the recovery period.
Additionally, there was no accumulation of G1T38 as
measured by PK on repeat dosing through 28 days in either
rats or dogs (Supplementary Table 3). These data suggest
G1T38 has the potential to be dosed continuously in humans
at an efficacious level.
In summary, we have identified and characterized
G1T38 as a novel, potent, selective and orally
bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 that
shows significant efficacy in CDK4/6 dependent tumors
by effectively inhibiting tumor growth without causing
severe neutropenia. G1T38 may, therefore, be an optimal
therapeutic for daily use as an oral antineoplastic agent,
allowing for a greater TI than palbociclib. G1T38 has
recently completed testing in human subjects in a Phase
1 healthy volunteer study to assess safety, PK, and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tolerability in 75 healthy subjects [46]. We are currently
evaluating G1T38 (in combination with Faslodex) in a
Phase 1b/2a trial in ER+, HER- breast cancer patients [47].

MCF-7 breast cancer xenograft model
South Texas Accelerated Research Therapeutics
(START; San Antonio, Texas) evaluated the antitumor
activity of G1T38 in a START Cell-Based Xenograft
(START-CBX) tumor model, MCF-7, representing
human breast cancer. Data collected from this efficacy
study included animal weights, observations, and tumor
dimensions. This information was used to determine agent
tolerability based on weight change and gross physiologic
changes, and anticancer activity based on tumor growth
inhibition or regression. Study endpoint was Day 60.
MCF-7 cells were harvested from culture and injected
into immune-deficient mice and the study initiated at a
mean tumor volume of approximately 150-250 mm3. In
all studies, G1T38 and palbociclib was given as a daily
oral treatment at 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg. Tamoxifen
was administered subcutaneous (s.c.) at 20 mg/kg M-F,
fulvestrant was administered s.c. 5 mg per mouse once
a week, GW5638 was administered orally at 25 mg/kg
daily and GDC0941 (Selleckchem) was administered
orally at 100 mg/kg daily for the duration of each study.
Tumor growth inhibition (%TGI) was calculated using
the following equation: %TGI=(1-(((TVtmtfinal-TVtmtinitial))/
((AVERAGE(TVctlfinal))-(AVERAGE(TVctlinital)))))*100. All
protocols were IACUC approved and experiments were

In vivo G1T38 murine pharmacokinetic (PK)
assay
For PK analysis comparing G1T38 levels in tumor
and plasma, MCF7 tumor bearing mice were given a
single oral gavage at 100 mg/kg of G1T38 and blood
via cardiac puncture and tumors were harvested at 0
(predose), 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 hours post treatment. For
7-day continuous oral PK analysis, C57BL/6 mice were
administered daily oral gavages of 10, 50 or 100 mg/kg
of G1T38 or palbociclib for 7 consecutive days. Blood
was collected from treated mice via cardiac puncture 24
hours post drug administration (3 mice/dose/time-point).
Plasma G1T38 concentration was determined by LCMS/MS following standard protocols. PK analyses on
plasma G1T38 concentration were performed in Watson

EdU incorporation in G1T38 and palbociclib
treated mice
C57BL/6 mice were administered daily oral
gavages of 10, 50 or 100 mg/kg of G1T38 or palbociclib
for 7 consecutive days. Eleven hours later, each mouse
was given a single IP injection of 10 mg/kg EdU and
femurs harvested 1 hours later (3 mice/dose/time-point).
All protocols were IACUC approved and experiments
