ABSTRACT
Exosomes are nano-sized membrane vesicles released by a variety of cell types,
and are thought to play important roles in intercellular communications. In breast
cancer, through horizontal transfer of various bioactive molecules, such as proteins
and mRNAs, exosomes are emerging as local and systemic cell-to-cell mediators of
oncogenic information and play an important role on cancer progression. This review
outlines the current knowledge and concepts concerning the exosomes involvement
in breast cancer pathogenesis (including tumor initiation, invasion and metastasis,
angiogenesis, immune system modulation and tumor microenvironment) and cancer
therapy resistance. Moreover, the potential use of exosomes as promising diagnostic
and therapeutic biomarkers in breast cancer are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

kinds of cells and contain a broad repertoire of cargoes,
including nucleic acids (ex., DNA, mRNA, miRNA, long
and short noncoding RNA), proteins (ex., cytoskeletal
proteins, Transmembrane proteins, and heat shock
proteins), and enzymes (GAPDH, ATPase, pgk1) [3].
Generally, contents of exosomes can reflect the nature and
status of original cells. The upgrading of specific proteins
and nucleic acids implies a degree of specific cellular
sorting into exosomes [4]. On the other end of spectrum,
exosomes have the ability of modulating cellular activities
in recipient cells by transferring genetic information [5,
6, 7].
Recently, research on the role of exosomes
involved tumorigenesis and cancer progression has
grown exponentially, including immune suppression,
angiogenesis, cell migration and invasion [6-8]. As
exosomes are capable of transferring specific proteins
and nucleic acids to recipient cells in the tumor
microenvironment or at specific distant sites, cancers
have used exosomes as a tool by which cancer cells
can transfer malignant phenotype to normal cells, and

Breast cancer is one of the most common
malignancies in women [1]. According to report of the
American Cancer Society, breast cancer alone take over
29% all new cancer diagnoses in women in 2016, and it
is expected to be leading cause of cancer-related death in
women aged from 20 to 59 years [2]. Past decades have
witnessed various cutting-edge diagnostic and prognostic
methods and the improvement of novel targeted therapies
due to major advances in our deeper comprehension of
breast cancer biology. Currently, available treatments
efficacy of breast cancer is still limited by drug toxicity
and resistance and lack of dependable predictive and
prognostic biomarkers. Thus, accelerating progress
against breast cancer requires both the development
of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets and further
understanding of the potential molecular mechanisms.

to help cancer cell growth [9]. Contents as miRNA and
proteins found in tumor-derived exosomes isolated from
patients’ bodily fluids play an important role in cancer
development and progression [10] [11]. These features
render exosomes as potential biomarkers for liquid biopsy,
and utilizing exosomal profiling in the absence of tissue
hold pronounced promise for disease early diagnose and
therapy efficacy monitoring.
Increasingly, exosomes are studied for their
potential roles as both indicators of breast cancer and
a prospective new treatment approach. Exosomes can
play important roles in different stages of development
in breast cancer. Through horizontal transfer of genetic
information between breast cancer cells, exosomes are
supposed to exhibit pleiotropic biological functions,
including stimulating tumor angiogenesis, reorganizing
the stroma to establish the tumor microenvironment, as
well as promoting tumor growth and drug resistance.
This comprehensive review highlights our understanding
of the contribution of the exosomes during breast cancer
development and evolution. We will also discuss key

concepts on their possible clinical applications, including
their use as prognosis biomarkers and novel therapeutic
targets, such as drug delivery system and exosome-based
vaccine.

BIOGENESIS AND CHARACTERISTICS
OF EXOSOMES
Exosomes are membrane vesicles of endocytic
origin, which shaped from inward budding of membrane
of multi-vesicular bodies (MVB) and released from the
cell into the extracellular environment with the plasma
membrane. Most prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells can
release exosomes, including stroma cell, reticulocytes,
epithelial cells, and tumor cells, which have been isolated
from serum, urine, bile, and breast milk [3-5] [7] [12].
According to proteomic analyses, exosomes have been
verified to contain a selective enrichment of a discrete set
of cellular protein associated with cell surface receptors,
cytosolic signaling proteins, metabolic enzymes, antigen
presentation, and major histocompatibility complex

Figure 1: Structure and contents of exosomes. Exosomes are small membrane bound vesicles sharing similar topology to the plasma
membrane. The lipid bilayer membrane structures of exosomes carry contains typical transmembrane proteins and receptors, such as the
transmembrane proteins PGRL, LAMP1/2, CD13, membrane trafficking proteins as annexins and RABs proteins, adhesion molecules as
ICAM-1, Lactadhesion and intergrin, the lipid raft associated protein as Flotillins, LBPA, Cholesterol, stomatin and tetraspanins, most
characteristically CD63 and CD81. Furthermore, the exosomal membranes surface is assembled with Immuno regulator molecules, such as
MHC-I and -II, CD80 and CD86. Within the exosomal lumen several proteins stabilizing and conserving the ‘informative’ exosomal cargo
can be found: Cytoskeleton proteins, HSPs, most typically Hsp70, cytoskeletal proteins (Vimentin, Cofilin, Tublin, Talin, Actin), metabolic
enzymes (GAPDH, ATPase, pgk1) and protein involving in MVB formation as Alixs, Tsg101, Clathrin. The contents of exosomes can be
transferred from the original cell to their target cells in microenvironment, consisting of RNA species (mRNAs, miRNAs and other types
of short RNAs), and a vast array of different proteins depending on their host cell.

the structure and contents of exosomes is demonstrated
in Figure 1.
There are a large number of mobile membranelimited vesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs) in
the extracellular environment, which can be further

pathway including CD63, CD81 and TSPAN8. ESCRT: endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery. MT, mitochondria;

subcategorized based on their size, biogenesis and release
mechanism, and content into exosomes, microvesicles
(MVs), and apoptotic bodies [3] [17]. Exosomes and
MVs have a distinct biogenesis, while the most dramatic
difference between exosomes and MVs is how they are
formed [18]. Exosomes are formed from inward budding
of an endosome resulting in a multivesicular body
(MVB), with the plasma membrane, which is secreted by
succeeding fusion of the MVB. On the other hand, MVs
are released directly by budding from the cellular plasma
membrane (detailed difference between exosome and MVs

discussed studies claimed that their studies were based on
exosomes. Henceforth, exosomes and microvesicles are
collectively referred to as exosomes unless indicated. (The
release process of MVs and exosomes is showed Figure 2)
Several studies has indicated the potential
mechanisms by which exosomes are internalized and
released. Accumulating evidence has indicated that
impose stress on cells, growth factors and increases in
intracellular calcium can induce the release of exosomes
[23, 24]. Exosomes also exert a feedback mechanism
regulating the release of exosomes from normal

cancer cells and normal human mammary epithelial
cells are regulated by exosomes derived from their own
cells [25]. Other investigations have revealed that that
exosomes are internalized via phagocytosis or lipid raft
domains [26] [27]. In breast tumor cells, detachment of
cells is a intense stimulation for the secretion of exosomes
[28]. Exosomes have also been expected to contributed
to cell-cell communication by activating them directly
by surface expressed ligands or by conveying signal
molecules between cells. To be specific, exosomes interact
with target cells via receptors, endocytosis, fusion with
plasma membrane, or the release of their cargo [29, 30].
Cancer cell derived exosomes usually carry molecular
signs and effectors of the disease, such as mutant oncoproteins, oncogenic transcripts, microRNA, and DNA
sequences. When taken up by recipient non-malignant
cells, such exosomes contribute to horizontal cellular
transformation and phenotypic reprograming, traverse
the tumor microenvironment, and finally result in the cell
malignant transformation [14, 31]. What is more, as the
content of exosomes is closely connected to the original
cells which the exosomes are derived, exosomes are
increasingly considered as novel diagnostic or prognostic
biomarkers [32]. Recently, growing number of studies

have also revealed the important role of exosomes as both
indicators of cancer development and a prospective new
treatment approach in breast cancer.

TUMOR TRANSFORMATION
During initial malignant transformation, exosomes
generated by breast cancer cells contain a variety of
proteins and RNA species can be transfected between
cancer cells as well as cancer and normal cells, conferring
a transformed-like phenotype to normal mammary
epithelial cells. Although the exact underlying mechanisms
remain to be elucidated, many research findings have
revealed that exosomes could alter the transcriptomes of
target cells and contribute to oncogenic transformation
and tumor formation [33] [34]. For example, exosomes
secreted by breast caner cell (MDA-MB-231) were capable
of transforming normal human mammary epithelial cells
(MCF10A cells) into cancer cells [35]. In cell culture and
mice models, these cancer exosomes contained miRNAs
(miR-10b and miR-21) altered the transcriptome of
recipient cells, with the RNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC)-loading complex proteins (RLC), and process premiRNAs Dicer, TAR RNA-binding protein 2 (TRBP) and

to exosomes acting locally to promote tumor formation

capacity.

38]. Adhesion is extremely important not only in various
pathological conditions but also in cancer biology. In
breast cancer cells, cellular detachment is related with
significant release of exosomes, and then exosomes
concentrate on the cell surfaces and mediate adhesion
to extracellular matrix proteins [28] [39]. Fetuin-A, a
glycoprotein from fetal bovine serum, has been proved to
provide a significant clue regarding cellular adhesion [40].
Via recruiting exosomes, Fetuin-A can mediate cancer
cells adhesion [41], and these exosomes also contribute
to the preparation of the metastatic niches and regulate
cell growth and motility [42] [43]. Taken together, these
currently available data show that exosomes isolated from
breast cancer cells can stimulate cell migration and induce
migration proportional to the metastatic potential of the
cell [44].
Plenty of research have shown that miRNAs secreted
from exosomes improve the invasive and migration
capacity of several breast cancer cell lines. Kruger et

HALLMARKS OF TUMOR GROWTH,
INVASION AND MIGRATION
In breast cancer, in addition to taking part in
initial malignant transformation, exosomes can transfer
signaling molecules to cancer cells within the tumor
microenvironment, and help tumor cells evade immune
response, promote tumor invasion and metastasis, remodel
the tumor microenvironment, and stimulate angiogenesis
(Figure 3).
Metastasis requires cell manipulate local
environment to optimize invasion and growth, including
loss of adhesion, increased migration and invasion [36-

al. investigated exosomes derived from MDA-MB-231
encompassed a higher level of matrix metalloproteinase
proteins, while the exosomes derived from MCF-7
contained more nucleic acid, transfer proteins, and protein
binding. In addition, the Gene Ontology analysis revealed
that several of profiled miRNAs are related with tumor
progression and metastasis, and a bundle of miRNAs
(including miR-301a, miR-130a, miR-34a, miR-106b,
miR-328 etc.) had different expression levels between
MDA-Exo and MCF-Exo [45]. Exosome-mediated miR10b secretion suppressed the protein level of its target
genes such as HOXD 10 and KLF4 and induced invasion
ability in breast cancer cell [46]. Characteristically
expressed and secreted by metastatic breast cancer cells,
miR-105 regulated cell migration through targeting ZO1 [47]. Breast cancer cells secreted miR-122 promoted
cell metastasis by adjusting the metabolic environment
to a premetastatic niche. By inhibiting glucose uptake by
premetastatic niche cells, exosomal miR-122 reprogramed
systemic energy metabolism and enhanced cancer
development [48]. In addition, tumor-secreted exosomal
miR-9, upregulated in various breast cancer cell lines
and known as a pro-metastatic miRNA, can be taken up
by normal fibroblasts and switch to cancer-associated
fibroblasts phenotype, thus contributing to tumor growth
[49]. Bone metastasis is a frequent event in breast cancer,
and transfer of exosomal miRNAs is functional mediators
of tumor-stromal communications in breast cancer bone
metastasis. Authors identified four exosomes-secreted
miRNAs (miR-127, -197, -222, and -223) that inhibited

CXCL12 expression in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 and
T47D to suppress cell proliferation and stimulate cell
cycle quiescence [50]. In breast cancer cells, exosomal
miR-23b promoted dormancy and decreased CD44 surface
abundance, a characteristic marker of breast cancer stem
cells (CSCs). Exosomal transfer of miR-23b from the bone
marrow and its suppression of MARCKS caused breast
cancer cell quiescence in metastatic niches [51].
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined
as lack of expression of progesterone receptor (PR) and
oestrogen receptor (ER) and amplification of human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. TNBC
derived exosomes could confer phenotypic traits to
secondary cells via cell-to-cell communication. Study
has revealed TNBC cell line Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes
significantly improved the proliferation, migration
and invasion abilities of the recipient cell lines, and
stimulated sensitivity to anoikis [52]. The preoperative
blood serum levels of miRNA from patients with breast
cancer revealed association between the level of exosomal
miR-373 to triple negative and more aggressive breast
cancer. Exogenous overexpression of miR-373 in MCF7 cells caused downregulated protein expression of RE,
and suppression of apoptosis induced by camptothecin
[53]. Exosomes derived from noncancerous cells can also
influence cancer progression. Wnt signaling pathway can
directly stimulate exosomes secretion and participate in
the transportation of exosomal molecules in breast cancer
progression. Fibroblast-secreted exosomes promoted
breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis by stimulate

at lower pH [65]. Park et al. revealed that hypoxic or reoxygenated epidermal carcinoma cells secreted exosomes
with the potential to regulate cell microenvironment and
improve angiogenesis and metastasis [66]. This result was
recapitulated in breast cancer. In breast cancer, hypoxiamediated triggering of HIF-1α (Hypoxia inducible factors)
enhanced exosomes secretion and lead to aggressive cell
phenotype [67]. Breast cancer-derived exosomes produced
under hypoxic conditions can also promote inflammatory
crosstalk within the tumor niche to promote growth, which
is decreased by activation of nuclear receptors within the
cancer cell [68]. Besides, tumor cells made cancer cells
significantly reduce the effectiveness of irradiation under
hypoxic tumor microenvironments. It has been reported
hypoxic regions in breast cancers is more resistant to
radiation and chemotherapy [69].

Hypoxic, an often transient phenomenon presents at
microscopic sites within tumors microenvironment, which
is linked to angiogenesis, tumor aggressiveness, treatment
resistance and poor outcomes in a range of different
cancers. With a unique ability, cancer cells can survive
and grow under hypoxic environments [56]. In breast
cancer cells, hypoxia condition is regarded as a major
trigger for exosomes secretion [57, 58]. Under hypoxic
conditions, the effects of exosomes on tumor angiogenesis
and growth are even more noticeable [59-61] (Figure
4). It has been reported that hypoxia-induced release
of exosomes from cancer cells may lead to neoplastic
transformation, malignant cell growth and invasion [6264]. Hypoxia was also favorable for exosomes trafficking
due to tumor microenvironment acidification, as exosomes
release and uptake have been indicated to be facilitated

angiogenesis. [70] [71]. Karnoub et al have suggested
an interaction between breast cancer progression and
MSCs [72]. Tumor-derived exosomes can contribute to
breast cancer development by converting adipose tissue-

MSCs into tumor-associated myofibroblasts, and exosome
treatment can increase the expression of tumor-stimulating
molecules (SDF-1, VEGF, CCL5 and TGFβ) [73].
Ruizhu Lin et al have verified MSC secreted exosomes
significantly promoted MCF-7 migration via triggering
Wnt signaling pathway [74]. MCF-7-derived exosomes
also modulated breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) formation.
Notably, MCF-7 derived exosomes significantly induced
the stem cell regulatory gene NOTCH3 in breast CSCs
under hypoxic microenvironment [68]. MCF-7-derived
exosomes up-regulated the activation marker CD44, the
CSCs growth factor IL6, as well as ApoE. In another
study, 4T1 mouse breast derived exosomes functioned as
pro-tumorigenic factors by promoting the cell growth and
suppression apoptosis of CD133 + tumor stem cells [75].

cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts and tumor cells,
manipulating the tumor microenvironments to establish
premetastatic niche which is more permissive for cancer
invasion and migration [82] [83]. Moreover, authors
proposed that tumor-derived exosomes might contribute
to metastatic niche form to promote tumor metastasis [84]
[85].
The cell factors secreted to the tumor
microenvironment from preadipocytes and adipocytes are
important components of the cancer stem cell niche and
exert their oncogenic effects in vivo [86]. Cancer-derived
extracellular miR-122 convert the metabolic environment
to a premetastatic niche, by suppressing cells glucose
uptake and reprograming systemic energy metabolism
[48].
More recently, by injecting mice with exosomes
taken from breast-cancer cells, exosomes have been proved
to be involved breast cancer organ-specific metastasis. The
underlying mechanism may be that exosomes expressed
different cell-adhesion receptor proteins (called integrin)
on their surface can target different organs and the specific
organs recruited an abundance of ligand for the receptor.
For instance, exosomal αvβ5 integrin directed to the liver,
whereas α6β4 promoted homing to the lung [87] [88].
Thus, exosomal integrin profiles might predict organspecific metastasis and act as a new biomarker in cancer
diagnostics, and integrin inhibitors might curtail metastatic
spread to specific organs.

EXOSOMES ACT AS STIMULATING
FACTORS FOR TUMOR ANGIOGENESIS
Exosomes are important mediators in promoting
cell angiogenesis. Previously study has suggested that
breast cancer cells derived exosomes converted MSMs
into myofibroblasts via a SMAD-mediated pathway [76].
Myofibroblasts, which are key cells of tumor stroma and
play an important role in the tumor angiogenesis. Thus,
Exosomes from breast cancer cells tumor exosomeinduced recruitment of fibroblasts could support tumor
angiogenesis. Breast cancer cell-derived exosomal miR16 downregulated VEGF expression in cancer cells
and suppressed angiogenesis, which could be consider
as an effective anti-angiogenetic agent for anti-tumor
therapy [77]. The correlation between circulating miR210 and tumor presence and lymph node metastases in
breast cancer patients has been well established. Neutral
sphyngomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) affected exosomal
miRNA secretion and promoted cancer cell metastasis
through the induction of angiogenesis in the tumor
microenvironment. Specifically, exosomal angiogenic
miRNAs from metastatic breast cancer cells, such as
miR-210, promoted their metastatic initiation efficiency
via enhancing endothelial cells migration and capillary
formation [78]. Exosomal miR-210 might be one of the
key factors for tumor angiogenesis and brain metastasis,
and high expression of miR-210 predicted poor survival in
breast cancer patients with brain metastatic [79, 80].

DUAL-EFFECT OF EXOSOMES IN TUMOR
IMMUNE SYSTEM REGULATORY
Cancer cells escape the host immune system through
manipulating their own immunogenicity and activation of
immunosuppressive mediators [89]. Exosomes released
biologically active molecules and posed modulatory
effects on immune cells [90]. tumor released exosomes
have been known for the diverse immunosuppressive
effects in cancer progression [91]. One study by Wolfers
et al reported exosome transfer tumor antigens from tumor
cells to dendritic cells (DCs), and function in immuneinterventions [92]. In most of these studies, exosomes
delivered negative signals and posed suppressive effects
on anti-tumour immune responses in breast cancer, as
suppress specific T cell immunity and convert immune
cells into pro-tumorigenic phenotypes [8]. Tumor-derived
exosomes expressed functional CD39 and CD73, which
resulted in de-phosphorylation of exogenous ATP and
5’AMP to procedure adenosine, and rising adenosine can
attenuate T cell function [93]. DC-secreted exosomes
(DCex) induced apoptosis by activation of caspase,
activated natural killer cells and killed tumor cells [94]
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)
facilitated immunosuppressive functions and contributed
to tumor progression [95]. Exosomes isolated from

also been found contributed to the growth of tumors by
blocking IL-2-mediated activation of NK cells and their
immune response to tumor cells [97]. Humor tumorderived exosomes, as immune inhibitory, exosomal
delivery of TGFβ1 to T cell or NK cell lead to downregulation of NKG2D expression [98, 99]. Circulating
Exosomes secreted by breast cancer contributed to NF-κB

activity by upregulation of inflammatory cytokines [100].
Interestingly, studies have discovered that human
breast milk contains exosomes with immune modulatory
for the development of the infant’s immune system [101].
Consistent with prior research conclusions, immunerelated exosomal miRNAs from breast milk are resistant
to general harsh conditions, and are essential for the
development of infant immune system [102].

miRNAs (miR-451 and miR-326) and the latter conferred
a more deleterious phenotype through “re-templating”
recipient breast cancer cells’ transcriptional landscape
to reflect the P-glycoprotein over-expressed character of
donor cells [112]. Exosomes from doxorubicin-resistant
breast cancer cells spread resistance capacity in recipient
cells by delivering miRNAs, such as miR-100, miR-222,
and miR-30a [113], and exosomal miRNAs can also
transmit drug resistance to sensitive cells [114]. Exosomes
derived from stromal fibroblasts transferred noncoding
RNA to breast cancer cells and contribute to treatment
resistance through expanding therapy-resistant tumorinitiating cells. [115].

IRRADIATION THERAPY
Radiotherapy is a significant treatment method
in breast cancer. Generally, oxygen is indispensable for
radiation cytotoxic to cause DNA damage. Thus, breast
cancer can be more resistant to radiation therapy under
hypoxic microenvironment , and it has been shown that
hypoxia leads to the increased production of exosomes
[116] [117]. Besides, exosomes transferred from stromal
to breast cancer cells stimulates antiviral signaling and
derived radiation resistance in primary tumor [115].
Another study indicated that the proteome profiles of
tumor-derived exosomes have been implicated in the
indication of the oxygenation status of breast tumors [117].

EXOSOMES ACT AS MEDIATORS OF
THERAPY RESISTANCE IN BREAST
CANCER
Breast cancer therapy has received many
restrictions due to therapy resistance, explanation of
mechanisms responsible for drug resistance and seeking
reliable indicators to predict the therapeutic effect is
essential to achieve more effective and individualized
chemotherapeutic treatment of breast cancer patients.
Currently, some studies have shown that breast cancer
exosome-mediated transfer of genetic information can
induce therapy resistance and promote tumor progression,
such as extruding hydrophilic drugs from cancer cells
[103-105]. Studies also implied roles of exosomes
in breast cancer radiotherapy resistance and cancer
immunotherapy [106, 107]. (Figure 5)

ENDOCRINE THERAPY AND TARGET
THERAPY
Tamoxifen resistance remains a daunting challenge
to the successful treatment of ER-positive breast cancer.
In ER-positive breast cancer, exosomes secreted from
tamoxifen resistant cells (MCF-7TamR) significantly
promoted tamoxifen sensitive cells (MCF-7wt)
proliferation and colony-forming ability in the presence
of tamoxifen, and this effect was partly contributed to
miRNAs (miR-221/222) enclosed in exosomes. miR221/222 subsequently down-regulated its target genes

CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCE
As breast cancer cells escape chemotherapy via
various mechanisms, resistance to chemotherapy drugs
remains a essential issue in the management of patients. As
information transporters of intercellular communication,
exosomes help cancer cells export chemotherapeutic
drugs, which may facilitate the development of
chemotherapy resistance. lead to chemo-resistance [5].
In breast cancer, drug-resistant breast cancer
cells may spread resistance capacity and alter chemosusceptibility in recipient sensitive cells via intercellular
transfer of exosomal miRNAs (including miR-100, miR222, and miR-30a) [107] [108]. The intercellular transport
of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was known to be involved in
drug resistance via drug efflux across membranes [109,
110]. Exosomes mediated drug resistance via delivering
P-gp from docetaxel-resistant cells to sensitive ones [111].
Jaiswal et al found that exosomes secreted by doxorubicinwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of P27 and ER𝛼 protein levels, which caused increased
tamoxifen resistance in recipient cells [118]
The clinical value of HER2-targeted therapies as
trastuzumab and lapatinib is the most promising treatment
for HER2 positive breast cancer patients targeted therapy.
Despite this significant clinical benefit in HER2-positive
patients, some patients exhibit intrinsic resistance to
anti-HER2 therapy, and the underlying mechanism may
be tumor cells utilizing alternative growth signaling or
intracellular transduction molecules to bypass HER2
blockade [119, 120]. Tumor exosomes carrying antigens
that are targets for anti-tumor antibodies, therefore
competitively inhibit the drug activity and contribute to

treatment failure. Consistent with these results, HER2
positive derived exosomes from BT-474 and SK-BR-3
cells interfered with the bioactivity of HER2-targeted
therapeutic drugs by directing binding to Trastuzumab and
prevented cancer cells from the anti-proliferative effects
of trastuzumab. By contrast, no negative influence on the
anti-proliferative activity of Lapatinib was observed [103,
121, 122]. The schematic in Figure 5 indicates the roles of
cancer exosomes in modulating sensitivity to anti-HER2
therapy. Furthermore, HER2+ exosomes can be indicative
of the stages of tumor development and HER2-related
tumor aggressiveness. Exosomes isolated from HER2positive advanced stage breast cancer patients’ serum
presented higher-level binding ability to Trastuzumab
compared to exosomes purified from the serum of those
in early stage [107].

101 concentrations are associated with lymph-node
positive cancer, and miR-373 levels were significantly
upregulated in triple negative and ER and PR negative
breast cancer patients [128]. By comparing tumor derived
exosomes at baseline, pre-treatment and post-treatment,
during follow up, and correlating with both clinical and
pathologic response, we might also be able to predict
therapeutic response and patient prognosis. Taken together,
these reports suggested the roles of exosomes as promising
biomarkers for the early diagnose of breast cancers and for
evaluation of therapeutic effect and the patient’s outcome.

EXOSOMES-BASED THERAPY
Exosome involvement as carriers of cellular
information in cancer progression is a promising strategy
in the field of vectors for targeted drug delivery. And
well established functional exosomes mimetics strongly
increased the pharmaceutical acceptability of such
drug delivery system [129]. Via drug delivery abilities
for breast cancer target therapy, exosomes delivered
chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin to tumor tissue
and suppressed cancer growth [130]. As natural carriers
of miRNA, exosomes could be exploited as an RNA
drug delivery system as cancer therapy. One study has
examined that modified exosomes can be used to transfer
nucleic acid drugs such as let-7a to epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR)-positive breast cancer cells
[131]. Recently, different groups have demonstrated that
exosomes can be loaded on doxorubicin and with the aid
of targeting moieties can efficiently release doxorubicin to
different types of cancer cells [132]. In breast and ovarian
cancer mouse models, exosomal doxorubicin significantly
increased the therapeutic index of doxorubicin and limited
the crossing of doxorubicin through the myocardial
endothelial cells and avoiding accumulation of drug in
the heart without affecting other organs. [133]. However,
several essential issues need to be resolved to use
exosomes more efficiently and widely. For instance, the
drug delivery system requires that nucleic acid drugs can
be efficiently transfected into exosomes, and the suitable
host cells for exosome injection is an essential factor for
future clinical applications.
Exosomes have been found to be involved in
modulation of immune system, and the clinical use
of exosomes showed promising results in cancer
immunotherapy [134, 135]. Autologous dendritic cellderived exosomes have been proved to be well tolerated
in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and
metastatic melanoma [136, 137]. Therapeutic filtration
of cancer exosomes from the circulation could alleviate
exosome-mediated immune suppression and increase
cancer immunotherapy efficacy [138]. Since tumorderived exosomes contained various cytosolic and
membranous tumor antigens, exosomes have been used as
a nanoscale cancer vaccine and a promising candidate for

EXOSOMES: FUTURE CHALLENGES
Exosomes have been proven to be important
regulators in health and disease, especially in tumor
biology. Tumor derived exosomes enclosing tumorspecific antigens and nucleic acids can be assessed noninvasive as potential diagnostic and predictive biomarker.
Besides, exosomes could potentially be used to identify
patients who are likely to develop metastatic disease, and
the process of exosome production could yield new targets
for cancer therapy.

DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS MARKER
Cancer derived exosome release was accumulating
in tumor cells, which could be isolated from serum, pleural
effusions, urine, and ascites fluids of cancer patients [123].
Alterations in expression levels of certain exosomal
biomarkers from body fluids of cancer patients propose
a role for exosomes as an early marker for diagnosis and
prognosis monitoring. In breast cancer patients, the levels
of CEA and CA153 in circulating exosomes are linked to
cancer progression [24] [123].
The biomarker potential for exosomes holds
huge promise for diagnose and manage breast cancer.
Circulating exosome-encapsulated microRNAs presented
as an early ideal biomarker for breast cancer, and
expression pattern of exosomal miRNAs is also correlated
with tumor malignancy degree and prognosis [15, 125]..
qRT-PCR and small RNA sequencing analysis of the
microRNA content from plasma exosomes of patients
with revealed that miR-21 and miR-1246 were detected
significantly higher levels, as compared to those of healthy
control [126]. Several miRNAs have been proved to be
associated with breast tumor subtype and stage. Exosomal
MiR-939 was found highly expressed in the basal-like
tumor subtypes and associated with worse prognosis in
triple-negative breast cancers [127]. One research has
revealed that decreased several levels of exosomal miRwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CONCLUSION
Exosomes can act as critical signal transduction
facilitators between cancer cells and their recipient cells,
via releasing a wide variety of biological molecules,
such as miRNAs, proteins and their complexes, affecting
the interaction of distant cancer cells in the tumor
microenvironment and the breast cancer progress. In
this review, we further elaborate the contribution of the
cancer and stromal cells derived exosomes to regulating
breast cancer progression. With the development of novel
therapeutic strategies targeting or utilizing exosomes, it
will lead to more effective prevention and intervention
strategies in breast cancer therapy. However, it is critical
to note that crucial contents of exosomes are still not fully
elucidated, and there is still a long road to fully understand
the role of exosomes in breast cancer progress. Exosomebased therapies, exosomes served as predictive and
prognostic biomarkers still need to be firmly validated
by further preclinical and multicenter clinical validation
studies.
