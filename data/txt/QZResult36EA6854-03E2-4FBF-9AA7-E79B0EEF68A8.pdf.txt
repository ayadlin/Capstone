Abstract
Metastasis, the cardinal feature of malignant tumors, is an
important clinical variable in patient prognosis. To understand the basis for metastasis, we systematically selected for
highly invasive cells from breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and
MDA-MB-453, with moderate to low invasive ability using
Boyden chamber invasion assay. The four-cycle selected
invasive lines, named MCF7-I4 and MDA-MB-453-I4, respectively, displayed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and dramatically enhanced invasive ability. EMT changes
were corroborated with decreased level of E-cadherin and
increased vimentin, fibronectin, and B1 integrin. Twist, a basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and AKT2, a known
proto-oncogene, were found to be elevated in the invasive
cells compared with the parental. Ectopic expression and
knockdown of Twist by short interference RNA resulted in
significant increase and reduction, respectively, of AKT2
protein and mRNA expression. Twist bound to E-box elements
on AKT2 promoter and enhanced its transcriptional activity.
Moreover, silencing AKT2 decreased Twist-promoted migration, invasion, and paclitaxel resistance. Reintroducing AKT2
largely rescued the phenotype resulted from knockdown of
Twist in I4 cells, suggesting that AKT2 is a downstream target
and functional mediator of Twist. Finally, we observed a 68.8%
correlation of elevated Twist and AKT2 expression in latestage breast cancers as oppose to 13% in early-stage breast
cancers. Our study identifies Twist as a positive transcriptional regulator of AKT2 expression, and Twist-AKT2 signaling
is involved in promoting invasive ability and survival of breast
cancer cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):1979–87]

Introduction
The molecular mechanism of metastasis is still poorly understood. Current models propose a sequential program of metastasis
where cancer cells penetrate the basement membrane, intravasate
into blood/lymphatic vessels, survive the journey in vasculature,
extravasate into secondary sites, and adapt to new host
environment (1). Metastatic tumors ultimately lead to poor clinical
outcomes; for breast cancer, a significant reduction in the 5-year
survival rate from 90% to 20% is observed when comparing
localized versus metastasized tumors (2). Metastasis-associated

molecular changes include decreased cell-cell junction proteins,
such as E-cadherin (3–5), and increased basement membrane
degradation proteins, such as matrix metalloproteinases and
collagenases (6, 7).
The serine/threonine kinase AKT/protein kinase B, a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, has been
shown to play a key role in cell survival and growth (8–10).
Activated AKT prevents apoptosis via enhancing glucose uptake
and utilization, activating nuclear factor-nB pathway, promoting
MDM2 nuclear translocation, increasing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL levels,
cytoplasmic sequestering of forkhead-related ligand 1, inactivating
Bad and Bax, and inhibiting cytochrome c release from mitochondria (11–13). Additionally, AKT contributes to neoplastic growth
via antagonizing p21Cip1/Waf1 and p27Kip1, inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3h, and promoting mammalian target of rapamycin
activity (11). Of the three AKT isoforms, AKT2 has been shown
to promote cell motility, invasiveness, and metastasis (14, 15).
Moreover, AKT2 is amplified or activated in prostate (9), hepatocellular (16), colon (17), follicular thyroid (18, 19), pancreatic
(20–22), ovarian (8, 23, 24), and breast carcinomas (10, 25, 26).
Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is
characterized by a basic DNA binding domain that targets the
consensus E-box sequence 5¶-CANNTG-3¶ and a helix-loop-helix
domain that mediates heterodimerization or homodimerization
(27). The bHLH protein family has well-described functions in cell
growth and differentiation in both vertebrates and invertebrates
(28, 29). Developmentally, Twist inhibits myogenic differentiation
via interfering with myoD and MEF2 activity (30, 31). Moreover,
Twist mediates transcriptional repression by inhibiting two
different coactivators, p300 and PCAF (32). Recently, Twist has
gained attention as a putative oncogene (33–35), as a contributor
to acquired paclitaxel resistance (36), and as a key regulator of
metastasis (37). Exogenous overexpression of Twist inhibits
apoptosis and promotes colony formation via suppression of the
ADP ribosylation factor/MDM2/p53 pathway (33). In the process
of metastasis, Twist plays a crucial role by down-regulating
E-cadherin and h-catenin, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), and mediating cell motility and invasiveness
(37, 38). Elevated Twist expression leads to higher vascular
endothelial growth factor expression, promotes angiogenesis, and
correlates with chromosomal instability in breast cancer (39). In
addition, increased Twist expression is found in rhabdomyosarcoma (33), melanoma (34), pediatric osteosarcoma (40), T-cell
lymphoma (41), gastric (42), prostate (38), and breast carcinoma
(37, 43). The elevated Twist expression positively correlates with
aggressiveness of cancer and poor survival rate (34, 37, 38).
In an effort to study the molecular mechanism underlying
metastasis, we have established a model system using Boyden
chamber invasion assay to select highly invasive cells from a

population of moderate to low invasive breast cancer lines (MCF7
and MDA-MB-453, respectively). We observed increased Twist and
AKT2 expression in the selected highly invasive cells and
investigated the possible functional connection between these
two proteins. We show that Twist increased mRNA and protein
levels of AKT2 in a dosage-dependent manner. In addition, we
show that Twist transactivated AKT2 by binding to E-boxes on the
AKT2 promoter and drove its expression. Furthermore, blocking
AKT2 largely abolished Twist-mediated paclitaxel resistance and
invasion activity. Ectopic expression of AKT2 rescued the
phenotype of knockdown of Twist. Thus, our results indicate that
AKT2 is downstream target of Twist and is a critical player in
Twist-promoted metastatic process.

Materials and Methods
Cloning and construction of Twist and related plasmids. Full-length
cDNA of Twist was generated by reverse transcription using normal human
mammary total RNA as template and followed by nest PCR amplification
with the primers derived from human Twist (nest primers: 5¶-GCTCTTCTCCTCTGCCCCGG-3¶ and 5¶-CATCTAGGTCTCCGGCCCTG-3¶). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)–fused and Myc-tagged Twist were created by
digestion of the PCR products with BamHI/EcoRI and by subcloning the
PCR products into pEGFP-C2 and pCMV-Tag3B vectors, respectively. The
resulted constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. AKT2 promoter–
driven luciferase reporter plasmids were described previously (44). Deletion
mutants of AKT2 promoters were created by PCR.
Antibodies and reagents. Antibodies against E-cadherin, a-catenin, hcatenin, g-catenin, h1 integrin, and fibronectin were from PharMingen/BD
Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Anti-AKT2, anti-Myc, anti-actin, and anti-GFP
antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Anti-Twist
antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).
Paclitaxel and growth factor–reduced Matrigel were from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO) and BD Biosciences, respectively. Two chamber culture apparatus was
obtained from Falcon (BD BioSciences, San Jose, CA).
Cell lines, transfection, and tumor specimens. Cells were cultured in
DMEM with 10% FCS and antibiotics. Cultures were maintained in a
humidified incubator at 37jC in the presence of 5% CO2. Transfections were
done with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in the presence of
serum according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primary human breast
cancer specimens were procured anonymously from patients who
underwent surgery at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center (Tampa, FL), and each
sample contained at least 70% tumor cells, as was confirmed by microscopic
examination. The tissues were snap frozen and stored at 70jC.
Cell invasion assay and selection. Invasion assays were done in a
Boyden chamber with polyethylene terephthalate filter inserts for 24-well
plates containing 0.8-Am pores (Falcon). Filters were coated on ice with
100 AL growth factor–reduced Matrigel at 0.5 to 0.8 mg/mL protein. Cells
(1  104 to 1  105) were plated in 300 AL of 0.1% bovine serum albumin
(BSA)-DMEM into the upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with
500 AL of 10% FCS-DMEM. After culture for 6 to 36 h, noninvaded cells in
the inserts were removed with cotton swabs. The invaded cells on the
underside were treated with a fixative/staining solution (0.1% crystal violet,
1% formalin, and 20% ethanol) for visualization. The invaded cells at
underside of the membrane were photographed. To select for invasive cells,
larger inserts and companion plates were used (Falcon). Cells (2  106) in a
volume of 1.5 mL medium were seeded in the insert and with 2.5 mL of 10%
FCS-DMEM as the chemoattractant in the lower chamber. After 24 h of
incubation, the invaded cells were recovered by trypsinization and
amplified for the next cycle of selection. Statistical analysis was done using
two-sample t test, assuming equal variance, and P value was calculated
based on two-tailed test.
Soft agar colony formation assay. Cells (1  105) were suspended in
10% FCS-DMEM containing 0.4% agar. The cells were then placed into a
dish containing a hard agar base composed of 10% FCS-DMEM and 0.75%
agar. The cultures were returned to the incubator and fed every 2 days with

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

500 AL of normal growth medium. Photomicrographs of colonies were
taken 14 to 21 days later.
Cell survival assay. MCF7 cells stably expressing pCMV-Tag3B or pCMVTwist were transfected with siAKT2 or siControl. Thirty-six hours after
transfection, the cells were treated with or without paclitaxel in ethanol.
Thirty-six hours later, percentage cell survival was determined by flow
cytometry or trypan blue staining. Briefly, for flow cytometry, 1 106 to 2 
106 cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with propidium iodide (PI)
solution (50 Ag PI and 200 Ag RNase A). Cells were resuspended in PBS and
analyzed via flow cytometry. For trypan blue staining, cells were diluted 1:2
with 0.1% trypan blue in PBS and then counted under a light microscope.
Live cells were not permeable to trypan blue and remained clear and phase
bright. Percentage of cell death was calculated via counting cells permeable
to trypan blue. Statistical analysis was done using two-sample t test,
assuming equal variance, and P value was calculated based on two-tailed test.
Luciferase reporter assay. HEK293T or MCF7 cells were seeded in sixwell plate and transfected with AKT2-Luc reporter plasmid, pRenillaluciferase plasmid, and Twist. The amount of DNA in each transfection was
kept constant by the addition of empty vector, pCMV-Tag3B. Thirty-six
hours post-transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase were assayed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase
activity was expressed as relative light units. Each experiment was repeated
thrice in triplicates.
Chromatin immunoprecipiatation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipiatation (ChIP) assay was done essentially as described previously with
modifications (45). Briefly, soluble chromatin was prepared from a total
of 2  107 asynchronously growing HEK293T cells that were transfected
with Myc-Twist. The chromatin solution was diluted 10-fold with ChIP
dilution buffer [1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mmol/L EDTA, 167 mmol/L NaCl,
16.7 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 0.01% SDS, protease inhibitors] and
precleared with protein-A beads blocked with 2 Ag of sheared salmon sperm
DNA and preimmune serum. The precleared chromatin solution was
divided and used in immunoprecipitation assays with either an anti-Myc
antibody or an anti-HA antibody. Following wash, the antibody-proteinDNA complex was eluted from the beads by resuspending the pellets in
1% SDS and 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3 at room temperature for 20 min. After
reversal cross-link incubation at 67jC, protein and RNA were removed
by incubation with 10 Ag proteinase K and 10 Ag RNase A at 42jC for
3 h. Purified DNA was subjected to PCR with primers specific for four
proximal E-box sites within the AKT2 promoter. The sequences of the
PCR primers used are as follows: 5¶-TGAGATGGAGTCTTGCTCTGTC-3¶
and 5¶-ATCACAAGGTCAGGAGGTCG-3¶ (E-box 1); 5¶-ACCTTCTCACCAAGGAGGTAG-3¶ and 5¶-TTATTATTTCCTCTGATGGGTGGAG-3¶ (E-box 2);
5¶-TGCTCCAAGCAGACAGATGGG-3¶ and 5¶-TTTTACCTATTCTACCTCCTTGGTG-3¶ (E-box 3); and 5¶-TATTTGACATGATTTCTGTGGGTG-3¶ and
5¶-TCTGTCTGCTTGGAGCAGGTGGGG-3¶ (E-box 4).
Northern and Western blot analysis. Northern blot analysis of total
cellular RNA was done according to standard procedures. RNA was extracted
using the RNeasy purification kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA was
electrophoresed in 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to DuralonUVTM membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and then hybridized with
randomly primed [a-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes for AKT2. Membranes
were exposed to autoradiography and the mRNA levels were visualized and
quantified using PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences/GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Western blot analysis was done as described
previously (36). Briefly, the cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Ag/mL aprotinin, 5 Ag/mL leupeptin],
separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies as
indicated in the figure legends.
Short interference RNA, short hairpin RNA, and retroviral construction. The short interference RNA (siRNA) duplexes were constructed with
SilencerTM siRNA Construction kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Two siRNAs for human AKT2 [GCAGAGATTGTCTCGGCTCTT (siAKT2-2 nucleotides 972–992) and GCACAGGTTCTTCCTCAGCAT (siAKT2-3 nucleotides 1418–1438)] and human Twist

Twist Transactivates AKT2
[AAGCTGAGCAAGATTCAGACC (siTwist1 nucleotides 505–525) and AGGTACATCGACTTCCTCTAC (siTwist4 nucleotides 541–561)] were synthesized. Control siRNA oligonucleotide, which does not match any known
human coding cDNA, was designed and used. The siRNA duplexes were
reconstituted to 10 Amol/L in sterile RNase-free water. Transfection of siRNA
for targeting endogenous genes was done using LipofectAMINE 2000 as per
the manufacturer’s instructions. The same siRNA targeting regions with a
hairpin sequence (TTCAAGAGA) was cloned into pSIREN-RetroQ-linker at
BamHI and EcoRI sites (a generous gift from Dr. Domenico Tortorella, Mount
Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). Sequences are as shown: 5¶gatccGCAGAGATTGTCTCGGCTCTTCAAGAGAGAGCCGAGACAATCTCTGCTTTTTTACGCGTg-3¶ (shAKT2-2); 5¶-gatccGCACAGGTTCTTCCTCAGCTTCAAGAGAGCTGAGGAAGAACCTGTGCTTTTTTACGCGTg-3¶ (shAKT2-3);
5¶-gatccAAGCTGAGCAAGATTCAGACCTTCAAGAGAGGTCTGAATCTTGCTCAGCTTTTTTTTg-3¶ (shTwist1); and 5¶-gatccAGGTACATCGACTTCCTCTACTTCAAGAGAGTAGAGGAAGTCGATGTACCTTTTTTTg-3¶ (shTwist4).
Retrovirus containing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was packaged in HEK293T
cells and transfected with pVSV-G, pPol-GAG, and respective pSIRENRetroQ-shRNA. MCF7-I4 was infected with the shRNA virus, selected with
puromycin, and used for migration, invasion, and survival assays.
Cell migration and wound healing assay. Migration assay was done
using Boyden chamber without coating of Matrigel. Cells were stained and
counted. ‘‘Wound healing’’ assay was used to detect the alteration of cell
motility. Cells were initially seeded uniformly onto 60-mm culture plates
with an artificial ‘‘wound’’ carefully created at 0 h, using a P-200 pipette tip
to scratch on the confluent cell monolayer. Microphotographs were taken at
0 and 24 h.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was done as described
previously (39). Anti-Twist and anti-AKT2 antibodies described above were
used for the staining. Briefly, paraffin sections of 3-Am thick were cut and
probed. After rehydration, samples were treated with solution containing
0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase
activity. After antigen retrieval in citrate buffer, the sections were incubated
with the primary antibody (1:100 in PBS/1% BSA, overnight at 4jC). and
then with biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The signal was amplified by avidin-biotin complex formation
and developed with diaminobenzidine followed by counterstaining with
hematoxylin, dehydrated in alcohol and xylene, and mounted. The
percentage of staining and staining intensity was estimated with ImageJ
(NIH, Bethesda, MD).

Results
Invasion selected breast cancer lines assumed a fibroblastlike morphology and displayed EMT-related markers. Using
Boyden chamber invasion assay, we intended to select for highly
invasive cells from a population of cells with low invasive potential.
To find candidate cells for this selection, various breast cancer cell
lines were tested for their invasive potential (results not shown). The
breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-453 exhibited relatively
low levels of invasion ability were chosen for invasion selection. After
four cycles of selection, the selected cells were compared against
their respective parental cells for morphology, invasion capacity, and
colony-forming ability. The selected cell lines (I4) showed dramatic
morphologic change resembling cells undergoing EMT, transitioning
from epithelial to mesenchymal-like cells (Fig. 1A). We examined
protein expression to determine if the I4 cells were indeed different
from the parental cells in their surface markers. There was a
corresponding decrease in epithelial markers, E-cadherin and
catenins (a, h, and g), and an increase in mesenchymal markers,
vimentin, fibronectin, and h1 integrin, in the MCF7-I4 cells (Fig. 1D).
There was a similar increase of fibronectin and h1 integrin; however,
there was no change in h-catenin and an increase in g-catenin in the
MB-453-I4 cells. The parental MB-453 cells did not have detectable
levels of E-cadherin and a-catenin, which remained the same in the
I4 cells. As expected, the I4 cells displayed dramatically increased
invasion ability, and MB-453-I4 cells also had increased colony
formation ability when compared with their parental cells (Fig. 1B
and C). However, parental MCF7 cells have potent colony formation
ability to begin with and its invasive selected counterpart did not
show a significantly altered colony-forming ability. This observation
may be explained by the fact that MCF7 cells lack caspase-3 and is,
therefore, more resistant to anoikis-induced apoptosis during
anchorage-independent growth (46).
Expression of Twist and AKT2 is elevated in the I4 cells and
Twist up-regulates AKT2. The changes in EMT-related protein
expression profile and the increased ability for anchorageindependent growth in I4 cells led us to examine known

using Boyden chambers. The parental and selected (I4) cells were plated at a low density and the monolayer morphology was photographed at 40 magnification.
B, the invasive potential of the I4 cells was compared with that of the parental cells. The duration of invasion for MDA-MB-453 and MCF7 pairs was 6 and 12 h,
respectively. C, colony assays were done using 1  105 cells. Cells were fed with 500 AL of 10% FCS-DMEM every 2 d. Photomicrographs were taken after 14 d.
D, total cell lysates were prepared and equivalent amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with indicated antibodies.

Figure 2. Twist and AKT2 are overexpressed in I4 cells and Twist up-regulates AKT2. A, Western blot analysis. Parental (P ) and I4 of MCF7 and MDA-MB-453 cells
were grown at 90% confluency and lysed and equivalent amounts of lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Twist (top ), anti-AKT2 (middle ), and anti-actin
(bottom ) antibodies. B, MCF7-I4 cells were treated with two separate siRNAs targeting human Twist sequence or the control siRNA (scramble ). After 72 h of
incubation, cells were lysed and analyzed with the indicated antibodies. C, parental MCF7 cells were transfected with increasing amount of Myc-Twist. Following 48 h of
incubation, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot with the indicated antibodies. D, Northern blot analysis. Myc-Twist was transiently transfected
into MCF7 cells. After 36 h of incubation, total RNA was insolated, separated on an agarose gel, and transferred onto membrane. The blot was hybridized with [32P]dCTPlabeled AKT2 cDNA (top ) or actin cDNA (bottom ). Expression of transfected Twist was detected with immunoblotting analysis using anti-Myc antibody (middle ).

transcription factors involved in EMT process and prosurvival
pathways. When compared with the parental lines, I4 cells exhibited
an increase in both Twist and AKT2 protein levels (Fig. 2A). Because
Twist has been shown to play a pivotal role in EMT (37, 38), we next
examined if knockdown of Twist would reverse the phenotype of
the I4 cells. MCF7-I4 and MDA-MB-453-I4 were treated with siRNAs
targeting two different regions of Twist and control siRNA. Whereas
expression of E-cadherin is increased, cell morphology and
mesenchymal markers, such as fibronectin, had no changes on
knockdown of Twist (Fig. 2B; data not shown). Notably, siRNAmediated knockdown of Twist in I4 cells resulted in marked

decrease of AKT2 protein level (Fig. 2B). This observation led us
to further explore the possible relationship between Twist and
AKT2 outside of the EMT scheme. Interestingly, ectopic expression
of Twist led to a corresponding increase in AKT2 protein level in a
dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Further, Northern blot analysis
showed that AKT2 mRNA level was increased on overexpression of
Twist in MCF7 cells (Fig. 2D). These data led us to hypothesize that
Twist is a positive transcriptional regulator of AKT2.
Twist transactivates AKT2 promoter. To determine if Twist
directly regulates AKT2 promoter, we examined the promoter and
found nine E-box (5¶-CANNTG-3¶) sequence motifs, representing

Figure 4. AKT2 mediates the effects of
Twist on migration, invasion, and paclitaxel
sensitivity of MCF7 cells. A, Western blot.
MCF7-Twist and MCF7-pCMV cells were
treated with siRNA of AKT2 or scramble
siRNA (as siControl). Following 72 h of
incubation, cell lysates were prepared and
immunoblotted with the indicated
antibodies. B, MCF7-Twist and
MCF7-pCMV cells were treated with
indicated siRNA (box ) for 36 h and then
treated with or without paclitaxel for
additional 36 h. Cell death was assayed by
trypan blue staining. The experiments
were repeated thrice in triplicates samples
for each. Ectopic expression of Twist
induced paclitaxel resistance (*, P < 0.05),
whereas knockdown of AKT2 significantly
abrogated the effects of Twist (P < 0.004
or P < 0.005 in MCF7-Twist versus
P > 0.05 in MCF7-pCMV cells). C and D,
similar siRNA-treated cells were used for
migration and invasion assay. Thirty-six
hours post-treatment, 1  105 cells each
were seeded onto the migration/invasion
chamber. After 36 h, chambers were
stained and counted for migrated/invaded
cells. The experiments were repeated
thrice in triplicates samples each. P values
for comparisons are indicated.

possible binding sites for Twist. Luciferase reporter assay was done
to examine if Twist was able to transactivate full-length AKT2
promoter. The result indicated that Twist led to a dosagedependent increase in AKT2 promoter transactivation as measured
by luciferase activity (Fig. 3A).
Twist binds to proximal E-box elements on AKT2 promoter.
Serial truncation of AKT2 promoter showed that Twist could
transactivate AKT2 promoter with a minimal of one E-box, but
maximal transactivation occurred when first four E-boxes were
present. The addition of E-boxes 2 and 3 contributed minimally to
the transactivation ability of Twist, and the full-length promoter
seemed to have repressive elements located between 1.2 and 3.1 kb
that inhibited maximal Twist-mediated transactivation (Fig. 3C).
Based on these results, we examined Twist binding to the first four
E-boxes on the endogenous AKT2 promoter using ChIP assay. The
results showed that Twist bound to endogenous AKT2 promoter
E-boxes 1 and 4, but not E-boxes 2 and 3, which corroborated with
our observations from the reporter assay (Fig. 3B).
Knockdown of AKT2 decreased Twist-mediated paclitaxel
resistance, migration, and invasion. Previous report had
shown that Twist conferred paclitaxel resistance in prostate
cancer cells (36). We generated MCF7 cells stably expressing
Twist and its control line with pCMV-Tag3B vector. When treated

www.aacrjournals.org

with increasing concentration of paclitaxel, we found that MCF7Twist cells had lower amount of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
cleavage than that of the MCF7-pCMV cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). In addition, MCF7-Twist cells also had a lower portion
of apoptotic cells compared with that of the MCF7-pCMV control
following paclitaxel treatment, suggesting that Twist conferred
paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). When compared with the control, MCF7-Twist cells
also had elevated AKT2 level, which was significantly reduced by
AKT2 siRNA (Fig. 4A). Knockdown of AKT2 significantly reduced
the prosurvival effect of Twist on treatment of MCF7-Twist cells
with paclitaxel compared with knockdown of AKT2 in MCF7pCMV cells (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that AKT2 is
responsible for at least in part the Twist-mediated paclitaxel
resistance of the cells.
To further show that AKT2 is a downstream target of Twist, we
examined if Twist was able to mediate its known migratory and
invasive functions in the absence of AKT2. Overexpression of Twist
in the parental MCF7 cells led to an increase in migration and
invasion ability as measured by Boyden chamber assays (Fig. 4C
and D). However, the observed Twist-mediated increase on
migration and invasion was significantly reverted when AKT2
was knocked down by siRNA (Fig. 4C and D). These data suggest

that AKT2 plays an important role in mediating Twist proinvasive
functions.
AKT2 mediates Twist function in MCF7-I4 cells. To further
show the functional link between AKT2 and Twist in controlling
cell mobility, invasion, and survival, we asked if AKT2 mediates
Twist functions in the selected MCF7-I4 cells, in which endogenous
protein levels of Twist and AKT2 were elevated (Fig. 2A) and
knockdown of Twist decreased AKT2 expression (Fig. 2B). Parental
MCF7 cells, expressing undetectable Twist and low level of AKT2
(Figs. 2A and 5A), were used as controls. Using pSIREN-RetroQ
system, AKT2 was stably knocked down by two different shAKT2s
targeting different regions of AKT2 in both MCF7 and MCF7-I4
cells (Fig. 5A). As expected, Twist expression was not affected by
knockdown of AKT2 (Fig. 5A). In MCF7-I4 cells, reduction in AKT2
resulted in a significant decrease in cell survival, migration, and
invasion (P < 0.05; Fig. 5B). However, in MCF7 cells, the decrease in
AKT2 did not cause a significant decrease in any of the examined
functions, although the inhibitory trend was observed (P > 0.05;
Fig. 5B). These results further indicate that Twist exerts its cellular
function in some extent through AKT2.
Knockdown of Twist in MCF7-I4 can be rescued by
reexpression of AKT2. To provide further functional link between
Twist and AKT2, we next examined if AKT2 can rescue the
phenotypes resulted from knockdown of Twist in MCF7-I4 cells. We
stably knocked down Twist in the MCF7-I4 cells using two different
shRNA targeting different regions of Twist. We then reintroduced
HA-AKT2 into these cells. Figure 5C shows that AKT2 level was
dramatically reduced by introducing pSIREN-RetroQ-shTwist,
further indicating Twist as a transcriptional regulator of AKT2

expression that becomes deregulated during metastatic progress
and confirming our initial observations (Fig. 2B). Reintroducing
AKT2 into shTwist-MCF7-I4 cells to a level comparable with that of
the control significantly rescued the effects of Twist knockdown on
cell survival, migration, invasion, and wound healing (Fig. 5D;
Supplementary Fig. S2). These data in combination with the
findings observed from ectopic expression of Twist and knockdown
of AKT2 (Fig. 4) establish the functional link between AKT2 and
Twist and indicate that AKT2 is a major target of Twist and
mediates Twist function.
Coexpression of Twist and AKT2 correlates with advanced
breast cancer. Having observed that Twist mediated AKT2
increase in cell culture system, we asked if this regulation is seen
in vivo. We examined 12 normal breast and 65 primary breast
tumor samples for protein expression of Twist and AKT2 (Fig. 6A).
Of the 65 breast tumors, 26 had overexpression of AKT2 and 25 had
overexpression of Twist. Of the 25 tumors with elevated Twist, 17
(68%) also had elevated AKT2 levels (P < 0.0001). Immunohistochemistry of these tumor samples showed that the coexpression of
Twist and AKT2 are located specifically to the cancer cells and not
to the stroma (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, when grouped by the stage of
tumors, we found a striking pattern that the Twist-AKT2
coexpression increased in the late-stage breast tumors. Of the 16
stage III to IV tumors, 11 (69%) tumors had both Twist and AKT2
expression. By contrast, of the 45 stage 0 to II tumors, only 6 (13%)
had both Twist and AKT2 expression (Fig. 6C). When grouped by
histology, we observed similar elevated trend for coexpression of
Twist and AKT2 in the invasive tumor samples versus the
noninvasive counterpart (Fig. 6D). Although the coexpression of

Twist Transactivates AKT2

Figure 6. Overexpression of AKT2 correlates with elevated Twist and the coelevated AKT2 and Twist associated with late-stage breast cancer. A, representative tumor
and normal tissue lysates were analyzed by Western blot with indicated antibodies. Intensity of Twist, AKT2, and actin were quantified via ImageJ software. All the
values obtained were normalized to actin. The overexpression of AKT and Twist in tumor samples was scored based on the average values of the normal tissues.
B, representative photomicrographs of sections of breast tumor tissue from the same patient stained with polyclonal anti-AKT2 and anti-Twist antibodies. C,
overexpressions of AKT2 and/or Twist were observed in late-stage tumors. Percentage of overexpression of AKT2 or Twist (bottom ). Right column, the percentage of
coexpression of AKT2 and Twist in the different stages of tumor. Approximately 26% of the total patients exhibited overexpression of both AKT2 and Twist. Of the
samples that presented with elevated Twist, f68% had increased AKT2 levels. When samples were stratified according to the stage of the tumor, AKT2 and Twist
correlation increases in later stage when compared with the early-stage breast cancer. D, summary of immunohistochemistry analysis. AKT2 and Twist were found to
be more frequently detected in invasive breast carcinoma than ductal carcinoma in situ .

Twist and AKT2 between two categories of invasive carcinoma is
similar, we observed higher percentage of Twist expression in
invasive lobular carcinoma than that of invasive ductal carcinoma.
These data suggest that overexpression of Twist and AKT2
correlates with late-stage breast cancer and there is a significant
relationship of coexpression of Twist and AKT2, which further
support the findings of biochemical and functional links between
Twist and AKT2.

Discussion
Our study suggests that increased Twist and AKT2 levels
correlate with the increased migration/invasion and survival of
the selected invasive breast cancer (I4) cells. Whereas knockdown
Twist had no significant effect on EMT morphologic changes in the
I4 cells, we showed that up-regulation of AKT2 in the I4 cells is

www.aacrjournals.org

resulted from Twist (Figs. 2B and 5C). Twist transcriptionally upregulates AKT2 and transactivates the promoter by binding to the
proximal E-boxes. We also showed that Twist prosurvival and
proinvasive functions are at least in part mediated by AKT2.
Further, we observed correlation between elevated Twist and AKT2
in late-stage breast cancers, which suggests the biological relevance
of Twist-AKT2 axis in breast cancer progression. Finally, we showed
the functional link between Twist and AKT2 by knockdown of
AKT2 in both elevated endogenous Twist cells and ectopic
expression of Twist clonal cell lines (Figs. 4; 5A and B) as well as
by reintroducing AKT2 into Twist knockdown MCF7-I4 cells
(Fig. 5C and D). The evidence provided here indicates that AKT2 is
transcriptionally regulated by Twist and mediates at least part of
Twist functions.
Several lines of observation from previous studies hint at the
possible relationship between Twist and AKT2. First, tumors with

acquired paclitaxel resistance displayed Twist gene amplification
and AKT2 overexpression/activation (36, 47, 48). Second, both
Twist and AKT have been implicated in Wnt signaling pathway
(39, 49–51). Wnt pathway inhibitors Frzb/secreted Frizzled-related
protein 3 and Wnt inhibitory factor 1 were shown to lead to
decreased Twist expression and reduced AKT activation (50, 51).
Furthermore, both Twist and AKT promotes angiogenesis, cell
growth, and survival via altering h-catenin cellular distribution
(39). Finally, previous studies have shown that both Twist and
AKT2 promote EMT and invasive phenotype of cancer cells (14, 15,
34, 39). These observations suggest that Twist and AKT2 may work
in similar pathways in tumor development. Our observations
provide direct evidence that AKT2 is a target gene of Twist.
Previous studies have shown that overexpression of AKT1 and
AKT2 is a much more frequent event than their gene amplification
in human malignancies, suggesting transcriptional regulation of
AKT during the tumor development (52). AKT1 has been shown
recently to be regulated by signal transducers and activators of
transcription 3 (STAT3) and mediate STAT3-induced angiogenesis
and cell survival (53, 54). In addition, AKT1 is up-regulated by
h-catenin/TCF/LEF and frequent elevated expression levels of
AKT1, correlating with enhanced cytoplasmic/nuclear expression
of h-catenin, were detected in colorectal carcinoma (55). Whereas
AKT2 is up-regulated by MyoD during the muscle differentiation
(44), transcriptional regulation of AKT2 has not been shown
previously in the cellular processes that are related to carcinogenesis. We have shown in this report that Twist transcriptionally
regulates AKT2 and that elevated expression levels of Twist
correlates with overexpression of AKT2 in late-stage breast cancer
(Figs. 2, 3, and 6). Knockdown AKT2 reduces the effect of Twist on
cell migration, invasion, and survival (Figs. 4 and 5).
Our data show that Twist functions as a transcriptional
activator of AKT2. Previous studies have shown that Twist
functions as a transcriptional repressor and that the action of
Twist is regulated by its dimerization with other bHLH-containing

transcriptional factors. Post-translational modifications, such
as phosphorylation, can alter the dimerization preferences of
Twist, either promoting homodimer or heterodimer formation
(56). This alteration in Twist dimerization partners ultimately
affects the transcription regulatory function of Twist. It has been
suggested that Twist as a heterodimer acts as a transcription
repressor, whereas Twist homodimer, whose formation is favored
by elevated expression, acts as a transcription activator. Recent
studies in Drosophila mesoderm development and in human
cranial suture patterning suggest that Twist homodimer functions
as a transcriptional activator (57, 58). In addition, recent report
shows Twist as a transcriptional activator of N-cadherin gene in
prostate cancer cells (59). The specific mechanism through which
dimerization modulates Twist activity on AKT2 promoter remains
to be elucidated.
In conclusion, recent evidence suggests that Twist is a major
factor participating in tumor development and progression. In
human breast cancer, elevated Twist is found in 70% invasive
lobular carcinomas (37). Recently, Twist is found to be increased in
metastatic lesions of prostate cancer (38). As a novel player in the
metastatic program, Twist is gaining rapid attention as a regulator
of metastasis. Our finding of the functional link between Twist and
AKT2 suggests that targeting Twist and its downstream effectors,
such as AKT2, may provide novel therapeutic cocktails for breast
cancer intervention.
