Abstract
Colorectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSC) are responsible for the generation and maintenance of intestinal
tumors and are highly resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Aurora-A, a serine-threonine kinase
involved in mitosis regulation, plays multiple key functions in tumor initiation and progression. We found that
Aurora-A is overexpressed in primary colorectal tumor cells, in the CR-CSC fraction, and in stem cell–derived
differentiated cells, compared with normal colon tissue. Aurora-A expression was functionally linked to
centrosome amplification in CR-CSC, as indicated by the decrease in cells with multiple centrosomes that
followed Aurora-A silencing. Knockdown of Aurora-A resulted in growth inhibition of CR-CSC, alteration of
cell cycle kinetics, and downregulation of the expression levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, strongly
sensitizing to chemotherapy-induced cell death. Moreover, Aurora-A silencing compromised the ability to
form tumor xenografts in immunocompromised mice and reduced the migratory capacity of CR-CSC. Altogether, these results indicate that Aurora-A is essential for CR-CSC regeneration and resistance to cytotoxic
stimuli and suggest that therapies directed against Aurora-A may effectively target the stem cell population in
colorectal cancer. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4655–65. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Emerging evidence suggests the existence of a functional
heterogeneity in different cell populations shaping the tumor
mass. A small subpopulation of cells within the tumor mass
called “cancer stem cells” (CSC) or “cancer-initiating cells”
was shown to sustain tumor growth upon injection into
immunocompromised mice, in contrast to more differentiated
cells that are nontumorigenic (1). CSCs were first identified
in human hematologic malignancies (2) and later in several
solid tumors (3–7). Colorectal CSC (CR-CSC) isolated from
human tumors can be enriched in vitro through culture in
nonadherent conditions in the presence of basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF),
and subsequently propagated as “colospheres.” When injected

into immunocompromised mice, sphere-derived CSCs retain
the ability to generate tumor xenografts with morphologic
structure and antigenic profile that reproduce those of the
parental human tumors (1, 7).
The question remains open of whether CSCs originate
from normal tissue stem cells or from partially differentiated
progenitors, acquiring unlimited self-renewal potential as
a consequence of genetic and/or epigenetic alterations.
Because the tumorigenic process requires the accumulation
of multiple mutational events, stem cells seem to be the ideal
candidates to support this model due to their long life span
(8, 9). Genomic instability (GIN) is a key molecular step in
neoplastic transformation. The mechanisms underlying GIN
have been investigated in embryonic stem cells, in which it
has been shown that the mitotic-spindle checkpoint, although functional, does not initiate apoptosis, thus contributing to karyotypic instability (10). However, mechanisms of
GIN in CSC represent a largely unexplored field. It was
recently shown that embryonic germ cells transplanted in
the testis of severe combined immunodeficient mice could
generate a highly metastatic CSC population characterized
by new nonclonal genomic rearrangements (11). GIN can
be broadly classified into microsatellite instability and chromosomal instability. Chromosomal instability is observed in
∼85% of colon cancers occurring as the consequence of
mutation or amplification of several genes such as hBUB1,
BRCA1, BRCA2, and Aurora-A (12).
Aurora-A (also known as STK15/BTAK) is a member of a
serine/threonine kinase family involved in mitosis entry,
formation of spindle bipolarity, control of centrosome maturation, and segregation during mitosis (13). Repression of

Aurora-A by RNA interference delays mitotic entrance in
several cancer cells (14–16), whereas its overexpression leads
to centrosome amplification, cytokinesis inhibition, and
aneuploidy (17, 18).
The Aurora-A gene maps to chromosome 20q13.2, a region
frequently amplified in several human epithelial tumors
(19, 20). Overexpression of Aurora-A is sufficient to transform
rodent fibroblast cell lines giving rise to aneuploid cells (18).
Moreover, it was recently shown that Aurora-A overexpression in mouse mammary epithelium induced malignant
transformation preceded by centrosome amplification, chromosome tetraploidization, and premature sister chromatid
segregation (21). This evidence establishes Aurora-A as an
oncogene that causes neoplastic transformation through
the induction of GIN.
Aurora-A is also a key regulatory component of the p53
pathway as it phosphorylates p53 at Ser215 and Ser315,
abrogating p53 DNA binding/transactivation activity and
leading to p53 proteolytic degradation after MDM2-mediated
ubiquitination (22, 23). Consequently, Aurora-A overexpression
abrogates wild-type p53 functions, such as growth arrest and/
or apoptosis, entailing a checkpoint-response deregulation and
thus contributing to GIN and malignant transformation.
Due to its role as a spindle checkpoint regulator, Aurora-A
has been implicated in conferring resistance to chemotherapy
in cancer cells. Increased expression of Aurora-A confers
resistance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents
(24, 25), whereas interference with Aurora-A expression
sensitizes tumor cells to antineoplastic treatments (26, 27).
In this study, we show that Aurora-A is essential to maintain
CR-CSC tumorigenicity, chemoresistance, and migratory ability, indicating it as an attractive target for the development of
new therapeutic approaches for colorectal cancer treatment.

Materials and Methods
Tumor specimens and cells
Colon cancer specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection, in accordance with ethical standards
of the Institutional Committee of University of Palermo on human experimentation. Normal colon specimens were obtained
from peritumoral tissue. Enzymatic digestion was performed
using collagenase (1.5 mg/mL; Invitrogen) and hyaluronidase
(20 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described (1, 28).
The digested tissue was cultured either in adherent conditions
in the presence of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) to obtain primary tumor cells, or in nonadherent
conditions using ultralow adhesion flasks (Corning, Inc.) in the
presence of serum-free cell medium supplemented with EGF
(20 ng/mL) and bFGF (10 ng/mL; both from Sigma-Aldrich)
to promote the growth of undifferentiated spheres, which took
1 to 2 months. Only sphere cultures validated for a CR-CSC
phenotype (CD133+CD29+CK20−) and for the ability to xenograft in immunocompromised mice were considered as CRCSC and were used for subsequent studies. To achieve the
in vitro differentiation of CR-CSC into sphere-derived adherent
cells (SDAC), spheres were cultured in adherent conditions in

4656

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

the presence of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for at
least 7 days. Magnetic cell separation of CD133+/CD133− cells
was performed on fresh tumor digest using microbeads conjugated with anti-CD133/1 (Miltenyi Biotec).
Western blot
Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold NP40 lysis buffer
and Western blot analyses were performed as previously described (29). Membranes were incubated with antibodies
against Aurora-A (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Mcl-1,
Bcl-xL, MDM2, p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), Bcl-2
(Upstate Biotechnology), and β-Actin (Calbiochem). Densitometry analysis was performed by Scion image (Scion). Results were expressed as protein/β-actin absorbance ratio.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5-μm-thick
paraffin-embedded sections of human CRC tissue or tumors
xenografts. Sections were exposed to antibodies against cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20 (DAKO Corp.), or isotype-matched
controls at appropriate dilutions. Sections were processed as
previously described (29). For H&E staining, dewaxed sections
were stained in hematoxylin for 5 minutes, washed in water, and
then exposed for 1 minute to eosin. For Alcian blue staining,
sections were stained with Alcian blue 8GX (Sigma-Aldrich)
and counterstained with nuclear fast red (Lab Vision, Inc.).
Immunofluorescence was performed on 5-μm-thick optimum cutting temperature–embedded cryosections of human
normal and cancer tissues, on primary cancer cells and SDAC
(grown on polylisine-coated glass coverslips), and on CR-CSC
(cytospun on microscope slides). Tissue sections were fixed
in ice-cold acetone, whereas cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X, and blocked
with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Samples were exposed to
antibodies against γ-Tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), Aurora-A
(CST), CD133 (Miltenyi Biotec), CD29 (Calbiochem), cytokeratin 20 (DAKO), epithelial antigen (Ber-EP4, DAKO), and
β-Catenin (Santa Cruz), or isotype-matched controls. Then,
cells were treated with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-mouse
or anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen) plus RNase A (200 ng/mL,
Sigma-Aldrich) and counterstained using Toto-3 iodide (Invitrogen). For centrosome counting, at least five randomly
selected regions for slides were analyzed and a minimum
of 500 nuclei was counted for each sample. Samples were
analyzed on a Nikon confocal microscope equipped with
×40 oil objectives and EZ-C1 software.
Ploidy determination
CR-CSCs were treated with 0.2 μg/mL colcemid (SigmaAldrich) for 6 hours, dissociated by trypsinization, swollen in
75 mmol/L KCl, fixed with 3:1 methanol/acetic acid, and dropped
onto glass microscope slides. Slides were dried and stained with
3% Giemsa. Chromosome numbers were evaluated using a
BX60 Olympus microscope under a ×100 oil objective.
Cell cycle analysis
Dissociated CR-CSCs were fixed overnight in ice-cold 70%
ethanol. Cells were resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/mL

and injected s.c. Tumor mass size was measured weekly for
up to 8 weeks according to the formula: (π/6) * larger diameter * (smaller diameter)2.

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was obtained using the Rneasy Mini kit (Qiagen
GmbH) and retrotranscribed using the High-Capacity cDNA
Archive kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR analysis was performed with the ABI PRISM 7900HT (Applied Biosystem).
The probes and primer sets (all from Applied Biosystems)
used were as follows: Hs01582072_m1 (Aurora-A),
Hs00195591_m1 (Snail), Hs00195591_s1 (Twist), and Hu glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Relative quantitation of gene expression was calculated on triplicate
reactions using the ΔΔCt method. Data processing was
performed using the ABI PRISM SDS software v2.1 (Applied
Biosystems).

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA (one
way or two way) with the Bonferroni posttest using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc). Results were considered
statistically significant when P values were <0.05. Asterisks
indicate P < 0.05 (*) and P < 0.01 (**).

Cell viability
Cell viability was evaluated on primary cancer cells, CR-CSC
and SDAC-transduced PLK0.1-shAurora-A, or control shRNA
and treated with 50 μg/mL 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and/or
100 μmol/L oxaliplatin (both from Sigma-Aldrich) for 24
hours. Viability was assessed using the CellTiter Aqueous Assay kit (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell death was analyzed with orange acridine (50
μg/mL) and ethidium bromide (1 μg/mL) staining.
Lentiviral transduction
Gene transfer of primary tumor cells, CR-CSC, and SDAC
was performed with the PLK0.1 lentiviral vector (SigmaAldrich) and sequenced-verified short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
for Aurora-A or an equivalent scrambled sequence. Lentiviral
supernatants were collected 48 hours after calcium phosphate
transfection of HEK-293T packaging cell line and centrifuged
at 141,000 g at 4°C for 90 minutes to obtain a virus-containing
pellet that was resuspended in DMEM or stem cell medium.
Cells (1 × 105; either primary, CR-CSC, or SDAC) were centrifuged for 40 minutes at 800 rpm with 1 mL of viral supernatant (PLK0.1-shAurora-A or control shRNA) in the presence of
8 μg/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). After three cycles of infection, cells stably expressing the transduced sequences were
selected through exposure to puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Invasion assay
Dissociated CR-CSCs (1.5 × 104) were plated on solidified
growth factor–depleted Matrigel (BD) diluted 1:3 in serumfree medium in 8-μm pore size Transwell (Corning). 3T3
stem–conditioned medium was used as chemoattractant.
Chambers were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours.
Generation of tumor xenografts
Five- to 6-week-old female athymic (nu+/nu+) mice were
obtained from Charles River Laboratories and maintained according to the institutional guidelines for animal experimentation. CR-CSCs (5 × 105) transduced with PLK0.1-shAurora-A
or control shRNA were suspended in 100 μL of PBS/Matrigel

Results
Aurora-A is expressed in human colon CSC
CR-CSCs were previously characterized by our and other
groups through surface expression of CD133 and absence
of differentiation markers such as CK20 (1, 7, 30). Colon tumor specimens (Table 1) were phenotypically characterized
by H&E and Alcian blue staining, and analyzed by
immunohistochemistry for the expression of CK7, CK20,
and CD133 (Fig. 1A). CR-CSCs were characterized through
the CD133+CD29+CK20− phenotype (Fig. 1A) and further validated through the capacity to form colon tumor xenografts
in immunodeficient mice (data not shown; ref. 1).
RNA analysis performed on five different samples showed
that Aurora-A was barely detectable in normal colon tissue,
whereas it was clearly expressed in primary tumor cells,
CR-CSC, SDAC, CD133+, and CD133− colon tumor populations (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot analysis revealed a high expression of Aurora-A in tumor specimens compared with normal
tissue (Fig. 1C, top), as subsequently confirmed in matched
samples derived from five different patients (Fig. 1C, bottom).
Among samples derived from the same patient, the highest
Aurora-A expression was displayed by SDAC, possibly reflecting their high proliferative rate. Further immunofluorescence
analysis showed that Aurora-A expression was barely detectable in normal specimens, whereas a strong signal was
detected in cancer tissue sections and in all tumor cell populations (Table 1; Fig. 1D). A diffuse cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was observed in primary tumor cells, whereas in
CR-CSC and SDAC, the expression was also nuclear and more
intense in dividing cells. Centrosome localization of Aurora-A
in G2/M cells also revealed mitotic spindle alterations
(Fig. 1D). Altogether, these observations point to a deregulation of Aurora-A expression in colon cancer. In addition, the
presence of Aurora-A in CR-CSC and in CD133+ cells suggests
that it plays an unpredicted role in the CR-CSC compartment. Because it was hypothesized that CSC could derive
from normal stem cells, we investigated the expression of
Aurora-A and CD133 both on normal and tumoral tissues.
Accordingly (31), in normal colon, Aurora-A was expressed
only in a small population (3.6 ± 0.6%) located in proximity
to colon cells with the high proliferative index (Supplementary Fig. S1A, top). The rare CD133+ population present
in the normal colon was mostly negative for Aurora-A
(Supplementary Fig. S1A, top), whereas Aurora-A was detected in CD133+ and CD133− epithelial cell populations

in colon cancer (Supplementary Fig. S1A, bottom). To verify
if Aurora-A was able to transform normal colon epithelial
cells, we transduced the NCM460 normal colon cell line with
Aurora-A and assessed their ability to form colonies in semisolid culture and xenografts in immunocompromised mice
(Supplementary Fig. S1B–E). In contrast to what we observed
in other cellular systems (17, 18, 21), Aurora-A expression was
not capable per se to induce cell transformation, suggesting a
tissue-specific influence of this gene on growth regulation.
Because loss-of-function mutations of p53 may induce a
phenotype analogue to Aurora-A overexpression such as centrosome amplification, GIN, and oncogenic transformation
(32, 33), we analyzed p53 status in CRC samples to select
specimens in which the effects of Aurora-A overexpression
were not masked by those of p53 mutations. We found
wild-type p53 in 8 of the 15 Aurora-A–overexpressing CR-CSC
lines analyzed (53%; Supplementary Fig. S2A; Table 1) and we
selected such samples for further analyses.
Aurora-A overexpression is responsible for centrosome
amplification in CR-CSC
Aurora-A has been reported to regulate centrosome number and genomic stability (15, 18). To investigate whether

4658

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

altered centrosome numbers were found in CR-CSC overexpressing Aurora-A, we evaluated the number of centrosomes
in primary tumor cells, CR-CSC, and SDAC (Fig. 2A, left). We
observed supernumerary centrosomes in 20 ± 5% of primary colon cancer cells, in 15 ± 6% of CR-CSC, and in 19 ±
2% of SDAC (Fig. 2A, right), whereas a regular number of
centrosomes was observed in normal colon sections (data
not shown).
Transduction of the Aurora-A–silencing construct, but not
of a control scrambled shRNA, resulted in the efficient
knockdown of Aurora-A expression at the RNA and protein
levels in all the treated tumor cell populations (Fig. 2B).
γ-Tubulin immunostaining of cells expressing Aurora-A shRNA
revealed a significant reduction in the number of cells with
more than two centrosomes and a simultaneous increase of
cells with one centrosome (Fig. 2C), indicating that centrosome amplification is a reversible process linked to Aurora-A
expression levels.
Cytogenetic analysis revealed a high percentage of aneuploidy (≥90%) in all cell populations analyzed (primary cells,
CR-CSC, and SDAC derived from the same patient; Fig. 2D,
left). Freshly isolated CD133+ cells showed a percentage of
aneuploidy comparable with that observed in CR-CSC, thus

excluding any effect of in vitro long-term culture. (Fig. 2D,

able to affect the number of chromosomes present in hyperdiploid colon tumor cells. However, we did not find a signif-

icant decrease in the number of cells with chromosomal
alterations following Aurora-A knockdown. (Fig. 2D, right).

aneuploidy, once chromosome alterations have been established, it becomes dispensable for their maintenance.
Knockdown of Aurora-A alters the cell cycle kinetics
of CR-CSC and inhibits their growth in vitro
Targeting Aurora-A by means of chemical inhibitors or
RNA interference has been shown to reduce tumor cell
proliferation in several cancer types (14, 34). We found that
Aurora-A silencing effectively inhibited the growth of all the
tumor cell populations examined, indicating that Aurora-A
is essential for the proliferation of colon cancer cells including
the CR-CSC fraction (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we observed a
modest increase Aurora-A–silenced CR-CSC in G2/M (from
12–19%), a simultaneous decrease of cells in G0/G1 (from 69–
53%), and an increase of the sub-G1 population (from 2–12%;
Fig. 3B and C). These results suggest that Aurora-A silencing
can induce G2 arrest in part of CR-CSC and apoptosis in
another part of the population, possibly reflecting a heterogeneity in p53 levels within the same CR-CSC population.
In support of this hypothesis, we found that the expression
levels of p53 were increased in CR-CSC transduced with
Aurora-A shRNA compared with control shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Additional flow cytometry analysis revealed
that CR-CSC (which are 100% positive for the epithelial antigen
Ber-EP4) show a heterogeneous expression of p53 and such
expression was increased by 55 ± 13.5% following Aurora-A
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Aurora-A silencing decreases antiapoptotic protein
expression and sensitizes CR-CSCs to chemotherapyinduced death
We have previously reported that CD133+ CR-CSCs are widely
resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs (1). Because Aurora-A
overexpression correlates to chemotherapy resistance in cancer
cell lines (22, 35), we investigated whether Aurora-A silencing

was able to overcome CR-CSC resistance to chemotherapy.
Aurora-A silencing resulted in a slight decrease of basal cell
viability in the three populations examined. As expected, control CR-CSCs were highly resistant to chemotherapeutic
drugs, whereas the viability of primary cells and SDAC was
moderately affected. Importantly, chemotherapy treatment of
Aurora-A–silenced CR-CSC resulted in a significant increase
in cell death compared with control CR-CSC, with a 75% reduction in cell viability obtained with the combination of both
drugs (Fig. 4A and B). A similar sensitization to drug-induced
death by Aurora-A knockdown was observed in primary tumor
cells and SDAC (Fig. 4A). To investigate whether resistant cells
would emerge from chemotherapy treatment despite Aurora-A
knockdown as a possible consequence of increased p53 expression, we exposed CR-CSC that survived chemotherapy to a
second round of drug treatment. Although Aurora-A–silenced
CR-CSC died after 48 hours of drug restimulation, CR-CSC
transduced with control shRNA showed only a modest effect
on cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S2D), indicating that
Aurora-A–mediated p53 inhibition is essential for CR-CSC
chemoresistance. Altogether, these results show that AuroraA silencing enhances the combined cytotoxic effect of 5-FU
and oxaliplatin, thus representing a valid approach to sensitize
CR-CSC to conventional treatment. We found a strong decrease in MDM2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 expression upon Aurora-A
silencing, whereas Bcl-xL levels were moderately decreased
(Fig. 4C). These findings suggest that Aurora-A overexpression
may confer resistance to apoptosis both by promoting MDM2dependent p53 degradation and by upregulating survival
factors involved in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
Aurora-A regulates the migratory ability and the
tumorigenic capacity of CR-CSC
It has been hypothesized that CSCs are the only cells able to
migrate from primary tumors to generate distal lesions (36).
Because Aurora-A overexpression was shown to enhance the

migratory capacity of cancer cell lines (37), we investigated its
involvement in cell motility of CR-CSC. Aurora-A silencing reduced the migratory capacity of CR-CSC after only 24 hours
(Fig. 5A). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that
Aurora-A knockdown reduced the expression of Twist and Snail
(Fig. 5B), two genes involved in epithelial-mesenchimal transition,
suggesting that Aurora-A may modulate CR-CSC invasiveness
through the regulation of key factors responsible for epithelialmesenchimal transition. Finally, we investigated the role of
Aurora-A in the production of tumor xenografts by CR-CSC. Nude
mice were s.c. inoculated with CR-CSC transduced with control
shRNA or Aurora-A shRNA. Control samples generated a palpable
tumor within 2 weeks from injection in five of five mice. Tumor
xenografts reached an average volume of 250 mm3 in 8 weeks and
reproduced the same histopathology of the human colorectal
tumors of origin (Fig. 5C and D, bottom). Notably, no tumor
formation was observed after the injection of equal numbers of
CR-CSC transduced with Aurora-A shRNA (Fig. 5C and D), indicating that Aurora-A is essential for tumor formation by CR-CSC.

Discussion
Aurora kinases are critical for cell division and have been
closely linked to tumorigenesis and cancer susceptibility.

Aurora-A is overexpressed in colorectal tumors (17, 38–40)
and is strongly related to chromosomal instability. We have
found Aurora-A overexpression in 60% of colon tumor specimens examined, a percentage compatible with that observed
previously (17, 39). Then, we have analyzed Aurora-A expression in different cell populations within colon cancer and
found that Aurora-A was overexpressed in primary tumor
cells, in CSC, in CD133+/- fractions, and in SDAC compared
with nontumor tissue.
Although Aurora-A did not show a transforming ability
per se in normal colon cells, the presence of an aberrant
Aurora-A expression in the CR-CSC fraction suggests its contribution to neoplastic transformation by facilitating centrosome amplification and GIN with a subsequent occurrence of
additional oncogenic mutations. In line with this hypothesis,
several studies have shown a correlation between Aurora-A
overexpression and aneuploidy (15, 18). In particular, a
recent analysis of Aurora-A expression in chromosomalunstable versus microsatellite-unstable sporadic colorectal
cancers showed that higher Aurora-A gene copy numbers
were found only in chromosomal-unstable colorectal carcinomas (41). Accordingly, we found that 90% of Aurora-A–
overexpressing colon tumor specimens displayed a marked
aneuploidy that could not be reverted by Aurora-A silencing.

Aurora-A in Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells

However, we have observed a dynamic balance between
Aurora-A expression and centrosome amplification in colon
cancer cell populations, as Aurora-A silencing was able to
restore normal centrosome numbers. According to studies
by Katayama and colleagues (22), we found that Aurora-A
regulates the expression levels of MDM2 in CR-CSC. Increased
Aurora-A levels in CR-CSC could therefore contrast with the
G1 checkpoint arrest by inactivating p53, allowing aneuploid
cells to proceed during the S-phase of the cell cycle.
Our observation that Aurora-A controls MDM2 expression
also supports a general model in which Aurora-A levels contribute to determine p53 status in cells with wild-type p53.
An initial overexpression of Aurora-A would determine p53
activation as a consequence of GIN, although later, its constitutive overexpression would promote p53 degradation,
thus creating a favorable environment for the establishment
of additional genetic alterations. In accordance, Aurora-A
silencing provoked an increased p53 stabilization in CR-CSC.
Our finding that Aurora-A is expressed in the stem cell fraction of colon tumors has important therapeutic implications.
The CSC population is particularly resistant to conventional
therapies due to high expression of ATP-binding cassette proteins, to hyperactive DNA repair pathways, or to decreased
production of reactive oxygen species (42–44). Additionally,
CR-CSCs have been shown to possess an autocrine and/or

paracrine mechanism of interleukin-4 production that confers
cell death resistance through the upregulation of antiapoptotic molecules (1). Our results show that Aurora-A silencing
decreases the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and, to a minor extent, Bcl-xL) in CR-CSC.
Accordingly, we found that Aurora-A silencing sensitized CRCSC to chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity, at least in part by
stabilizing p53 levels. Although the molecular mechanisms
that link Aurora-A to antiapoptotic protein expression and
chemoresistance remain to be fully clarified, Aurora-A therapeutic inhibition may increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs toward the stem cell population, possibly preventing
tumor relapse and metastatic dissemination.
Overexpression of Aurora-A has been correlated with the
occurrence of metastasis, whereas Aurora-A knockdown
inhibited the proliferation and invasion of human esophageal
cancer cells (16, 45). Our finding that Aurora-A knockdown
compromised the migratory capacity of CR-CSC in vitro
may have important implications given that CSC may play
a central role in metastasis formation (36). Besides suggesting a nonmitotic role of Aurora-A in CSC, these observations
suggest that pharmacologic Aurora-A inhibition may reduce
the incidence of metastasis in cancer patients.
Finally, we found that Aurora-A silencing completely
abrogates the ability of CR-CSC to form tumor xenografts,

highlighting its essential role in supporting CR-CSC tumorigenicity in vivo.
Although the overexpression of Aurora-A is not restricted
to CR-CSC, our results support its involvement in the exclusive properties of CR-CSC such as resistance to conventional drugs and tumorigenic potential. Recently, Cicalese and
colleagues (46) showed that p53 stabilization in tumor
mammospheres switches stem cell division from symmetrical to asymmetric, representing a potential mechanism of
tumor suppression. By regulating p53 stability, Aurora-A
could indirectly contribute to tumor growth in vivo through
an increase of CSC self-renewal. Preclinical studies indicate
that Aurora-A inhibitors lead to tumor stabilization and/or
regression (47, 48), in accordance with a possible role of
Aurora-A in driving colon cancer progression from the stem
cell compartment. Future clinical studies will definitely
clarify the therapeutic potential of Aurora-A inhibition in
counteracting progression and metastasis of colon tumors.
