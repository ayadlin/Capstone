Abstract
Observing drug responses in the tumor microenvironment in vivo can be technically challenging. As a result,
cellular responses to molecularly targeted cancer drugs are often studied in cell culture, which does not accurately
represent the behavior of cancer cells growing in vivo. Using high-resolution microscopy and ﬂuorescently labeled
genetic reporters for apoptosis, we developed an approach to visualize drug-induced cell death at single-cell
resolution in vivo. Stable expression of the mitochondrial intermembrane protein IMS-RP was established in
human breast and pancreatic cancer cells. Image analysis was then used to quantify release of IMS-RP into the
cytoplasm upon apoptosis and irreversible mitochondrial permeabilization. Both breast and pancreatic cancer
cells showed higher basal apoptotic rates in vivo than in culture. To study drug-induced apoptosis, we exposed
tumor cells to navitoclax (ABT-263), an inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, both in vitro and in vivo. Although the
tumors responded to Bcl-2 inhibition in vivo, inducing apoptosis in around 20% of cancer cells, the observed
response was much higher in cell culture. Together, our ﬁndings show an imaging technique that can be used to
directly visualize cell death within the tumor microenvironment in response to drug treatment. Cancer Res; 72(12);

Introduction
A major obstacle in the development and monitoring of
cancer treatments is determining how multiple biologic factors
interact to control tumor responses to therapeutic drugs.
In vivo imaging represents a powerful, noninvasive tool for
revealing cellular responses through time and space. A prevailing challenge, however, has been understanding and quantitating the responses of both individual cancer cells and whole
tumors to therapeutic drugs; namely, determining the distribution of drugs to cells, the extent and timing of cell death, and
the impact of these cell-level responses on tumor regression.
Recent advances in intravital microscopy have now enabled
high-resolution in vivo imaging at the single-cell level. This
technology potentially not only allows measurement of drug
distribution and uptake into tumor cells (pharmacokinetics,
PK; ref. 1) but also permits evaluation of downstream
responses over different time scales (pharmacodynamics, PD).
To visualize and measure in vitro drug responses in cells, a
variety of ﬂuorescent protein reporters have been developed;

these include caspase cleavable ﬂuorescent proteins [which
can function either as ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET); ref. 2 or turn-on probes (ref. 3)], mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization (MOMP) probes (2), senescence
markers (4), and autophagy probes (5). The majority of these
reporters, however, have only been tested in model cell lines
and thus often fail to adequately reﬂect the primary tumors on
which speciﬁc drugs are being tested in trials. Moreover, upon
conversion or cell death, many of these reporters exhibit only
subtle changes in ﬂuorescence, which tend to be more difﬁcult
to measure in vivo due to motion artifacts, and (often) lower
signal-to-noise ratios. In contrast, injectable imaging probes
(Annexin V, synaptotagmin) have been used primarily for
macroscopic imaging without clear microscopic correlates
(6–8). There is thus a clear need for robust reporters that can
consistently and reliably detect cell death in common tumor
models undergoing treatment with novel targeted drugs.
To address this need, we reasoned that structural analysis of
apoptotic tumor cells should be feasible in live animals provided that the resolution is sufﬁciently high to structurally
resolve mitochondria in the cells of live mice. Using a previously described construct (2, 9) and cloning it into a lentiviral
vector for greater efﬁciency, we created breast (MDA-MB-231)
and pancreatic (PANC-1) cancer cell lines that stably express
the intermembrane space reporter protein (IMS-RP GFP or
mCherry). In steady-state cells, mitochondria are seen to
contain IMS-RP. Upon apoptosis and irreversible mitochondrial permeabilization, IMS-RP is rapidly released from the
spatially conserved intermembrane mitochondrial space into
the cytoplasm, where it can be detected and quantiﬁed using
automated image analysis or visual inspection. Using these

cancer models, we show not only that apoptosis can indeed be
visualized in the tumors of live animals but also that apoptotic
rates are markedly different in vitro versus in vivo (both
temporally and fractionally). We also show that navitoclax
monotherapy induces apoptosis in vivo in both breast and
pancreatic cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MDA-MB-231 human mammary carcinoma cells [American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] were grown in RPMI media
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech). PANC-1 human pancreatic
adenocarcinoma (ATCC) cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS,
1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2% sodium
bicarbonate (Lonza). Cells expressing ﬂuorescent reporters
were grown in selection medium containing either 3 mg/mL
puromycin or 10 mg/mL blasticidin S (Invitrogen). All cells were
grown at 37 C and 5% CO2.
Cloning and lentivirus production
Mitochondrial intermembrane space reporter protein (IMSRP) is an established reporter of MOMP; it contains the ﬁrst 59
amino acids of Smac/DIABLO fused to a ﬂuorescent protein
(2). MOMP is a commitment step during apoptosis, and IMSRP enables the visualization of this process at single-cell
resolution in vitro. pBABE IMS-RP and pBOS H2B-GFP vectors
were generously provided by Drs. Peter Sorger and Timothy
Mitchison (Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical
School, Boston, MA), respectively. IMS-RP and histone H2B
were subcloned into the pLVX-AcGFP-N1 or pLVX-mCherryN1 vectors using In-Fusion cloning (Clontech). Plasmids were
veriﬁed by DNA sequencing (Genewiz).
For lentivirus production, LentiX-293T cells (Clontech) were
transfected with pLVX-IMS-RP or pLVX-H2B and Lenti-X HTX
Packaging Mix containing lentiviral packaging genes, using the
Xfect transfection reagent and following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech). Approximately 56 to
72 hours after transfection, the supernatant was collected,
ﬁltered using a 0.45-mm cellulose acetate syringe ﬁlter, aliquoted,
and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at 80 C.
All viral supernatants were used immediately upon thawing.
Generation of cell lines expressing reporters
Cells were transduced in 12-well plates using several dilutions of viral supernatant and 4 mg/mL polybrene per well
(Invitrogen). Twenty-four to 48 hours after infection, cells were
trypsinized and placed into medium containing 3 mg/mL
puromycin. When generating double reporter cell lines, double-positive cells were sorted using the FACS Aria II (Becton
Dickinson). Sorting was performed at the Harvard Stem Cell
Institute-Center for Regenerative Medicine Flow Cytometry
Core facility at MGH.
In vitro time-lapse microscopy
To determine the kinetics of apoptosis after drug treatment
of cell lines in vitro, we used time-lapse microscopy; this

2950

Cancer Res; 72(12) June 15, 2012

enabled us to visualize apoptosis of single cells, within a
population of cells. In vitro time-lapse microscopy was carried
out using a DeltaVision imaging system (Applied Precision),
which consists of an environmental chamber heated to 37 C,
with CO2 bubbled through a water bath, an automated Olympus IX70 inverted microscope and a CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD
camera. Cells were grown and imaged in ibidi 96-well plates
(ibidi). Fields of view were chosen based on the equivalence of
ﬂuorescence intensity across the cell population (to avoid
under/overexposure of cells) and on adequate cell density.
Once ﬁelds of view were chosen, cells were treated with (i) 25 or
100 mmol/L ABT-263 (Selleck Chemicals) in 0.5 or 2% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) or (ii) vehicle only, and time-lapse imaging
was initiated. Postacquisition images were visualized using
Fiji/ImageJ 1.45r (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and analyzed for markers of apoptosis (MOMP, rounding, blebbing, chromatin
condensation) either by eye or using MATLAB (MathWorks).
Mice
Nu/nu mice (Cox-7, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) were housed and handled according to Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee guidelines. For procedures involving window
chamber and tumor implantation, intravenous injection, and
intravital imaging, mice were anesthetized by isoﬂurane inhalation at a ﬂow rate of 2 L/min isoﬂurane:2 L/min oxygen. For
extended anesthesia, the isoﬂurane ﬂow rate was gradually
reduced to 1 to 2 L/min. All surgical procedures were carried
out in a sterile surgery room using a stereomicroscope. For
mice implanted with window chambers, antibiotics were
administered via the drinking water. Anesthetized mice were
monitored at all times. Titanium dorsal skin fold chambers
(APJ Trading Co, Inc.) were surgically implanted in the dorsal
skin fold of nu/nu mice, as described previously (1). Tumor cells
(1:1 mixture of reporter to nonﬂuorescent parent cell) in a 1:4
mixture with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) were injected subcutaneously into the window of the chamber and allowed to
grow for approximately 1 week. The skin was removed and
replaced with a 10-mm diameter glass coverslip, secured in
place with a C-clip. For intravital experiments, mice were
treated with 100 mg/kg ABT-263 (12.5% DMSO/PEG-400,
100 mL total volume) intraperitoneally once a day for 2 days.
Intravital microscopy
Anesthetized mice were positioned on a stable platform
heated to 37 C with the dorsal window chamber mounted
coverslip side facing up. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)dextran (Sigma Aldrich), Angiosense 680/750 (Perkin Elmer,
Inc.), Annexin-Vivo 750 (Perkin Elmer, Inc.), or CLIO VT680
were administered via tail vein catheter.
Tumors were imaged in vivo using a customized Olympus
FV1000 BX61-W1 (Olympus America) confocal/multiphoton
microscope with a programmable, motorized X-Y-Z stage. The
objectives used were 2/340 XLFluor (NA ¼ 0.14, air), 20
UPlanFL (NA ¼ 0.50, water), and 60 LUMFL N (NA ¼ 1.10,
water). AcGFP1 and mCherry were excited using the 488-nm
line of an argon ion laser and a 559-nm diode laser, respectively.
Emitted light was separated using a 405/488/559/635-nm

dichroic beam splitter and the signal reﬁned by the excitation
band pass ﬁlters BA505-540 and BA575-605, respectively.
Annexin Vivo was visualized using the Olympus FV1000 and
an Olympus IV100 ﬁxed pinhole confocal microscope (Olympus America). The objectives used were the same as those for
the FV1000 BX61-W1, and the lasers used to excite H2B-GFP
and Annexin Vivo were 488/750 nm, respectively. The emitted
light was then ﬁltered using a 560/640/750 dichroic mirror and
reﬁned with BA505-540 (GFP) and BA770IF (Annexin Vivo)
longpass ﬁlters. Each of the signals was captured separately to
minimize bleedthrough of ﬂuorescent signals into neighboring
channels. All images were stored and analyzed as 512  512
pixel (0.46 mm  0.46 mm) 16-bit images.
Image processing and analysis
Microscopy images from in vivo or in vitro experiments were
processed using collaborative digital ﬁltering (10) and alpharooting to simultaneously reduce noise and enhance image
details. More details are reported in the Supplementary Material.
Analysis of time-lapse images was conducted using MATLAB
(MathWorks) and Fiji/ImageJ 1.45r (NIH). Only unprocessed
images were used for image analysis. Image analysis for automated MOMP detection was done on individual frames of timelapse image stacks. Cell detection and segmentation were
initially carried out using the bright-ﬁeld images, from which
segmentation masks around cells of interest could be created.
Regions of interest (ROI) were then automatically selected
within the cells, excluding areas of high-intensity signal (from
mitochondria), to detect subtle changes in cytosolic intensity.
Similarly sized ROIs were also selected from the background.

Median intensity values for both cytosol and background ROIs
were determined and normalized by their areas; background
signal was then subtracted from the cytosol signal. From the
plotted data, a sharp change in slope is clearly seen over time;
this change corresponds to the point at which MOMP occurs.

Results
Characterization of cell lines
IMS reporter protein (IMS-RP) is a genetic reporter of
apoptosis that was created by fusing a ﬂuorescent protein to
the ﬁrst 59 N-terminal amino acids of the mitochondrial
protein Smac/DIABLO (2, 9). During apoptosis-associated
MOMP, the ﬂuorescent protein is released from the IMS into
the cytosol. Although IMS-RP contains the mitochondrial
targeting signal peptide, it does not contain the inhibitor of
apoptosis protein (IAP)-binding motif and is therefore biologically neutral. In cells transduced with IMS-RP GFP, ﬂuorescence was observed within the mitochondria (Figs. 1 and 2),
colocalizing with both full-length endogenous Smac/DIABLO
and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), another protein that
resides within the mitochondrial IMS (Supplementary Fig.
S1). MDA-MB-231 cells typically showed ﬁlamentous mitochondria, which localized most abundantly around the nucleus
(Fig. 1A). In contrast, PANC-1 cells typically contained shorter
and more rounded mitochondria that were scattered throughout the entire cell (Fig. 2A). These mitochondrial phenotypes
were consistent throughout all of our experiments, suggesting
that the mitochondria of MDA-MB-231 and PANC-1 cells are
morphologically distinct. In addition, IMS-RP ﬂuorescence is
brighter in the MDA-MB-231 cells, regardless of whether cells

are transfected or transduced, which could inﬂuence the
resultant images. Occasionally, round "swollen" mitochondria
were seen in both cell lines, but the presence of these mitochondria did not correlate with apoptosis. In fact, recent
ﬁndings suggest ill correlation between mitochondrial morphology and apoptosis, such that swollen or fragmented
mitochondria do not predict apoptosis (11).
In cell culture, apoptosis occurred in approximately 0.6% of
MDA-MB-231 cells and in approximately 1.4% of PANC-1
cells. Figure 1B summarizes a typical and representative time
series both before and after MOMP. The morphologic changes
(disappearance of distinct intracellular foci/appearance of
diffuse cytosolic ﬂuorescence) were readily visible and were
used to identify MOMP via image analysis algorithm (Figs. 1B
and 2B). The sequence of events leading up to irreversible cell
death (MOMP, rounding, blebbing, nuclear fragmentation) was
deﬁned for both cell lines. However, as previously observed in
HeLa cells (12), biologic variability was prevalent throughout
the cell population. To better compare time scales of events
and to provide statistics, we quantiﬁed these cell processes in
real-time. For MDA-MB-231, ABT-263-induced MOMP at 135
 85 minutes (mean  SD), rounding occurred at 61  83
minutes, blebbing at 134  77 minutes, and chromatin condensation at 173  67 minutes; for PANC-1 cells, MOMP
occurred at 363  37 minutes, rounding at 291  131 minutes,
and blebbing at 386  83 minutes.
Characterization of in vivo tumors
Although image analysis of sparsely plated cells in culture
was relatively simple, in vivo analysis proved more complex

2952

due to cellular crowding. To enable easier identiﬁcation of
individual cells, a second ﬂuorescent marker was introduced. For this, we selected H2B-FP, a nuclear histone
protein, which when fused to a ﬂuorescent protein can be
used to identify chromatin condensation, a later step in the
apoptotic pathway (1). We subsequently determined whether these tumors could grow in vivo, and if so how their
growth and apoptotic rates compared with those in the
in vitro environment.
Both MDA-MB-231-IMS/H2B and PANC-1-IMS/H2B cells
grew well in xenografts, showing similar growth characteristics
to the parental cell lines (Fig. 3). Both cell lines also grew readily
in window chambers. At 60 magniﬁcation, individual mitochondria could be easily discerned within individual cells in
vivo (Fig. 3). We were thus able to verify that mitochondria have
a similar appearance in vivo as in vitro. Furthermore, cells
undergoing apoptosis in vivo could be easily identiﬁed using
the dual ﬂuorescent marker. One signiﬁcant difference
between our in vitro and in vivo measurements, however, was
in the basal apoptosis rates of cells. For both cell lines tested,
we observed higher apoptosis rates in vivo than in vitro (MDAMB-231-IMS/H2B: 0.6% in vitro vs. 11.6% in vivo; PANC-1-IMS/
H2B: 1.4% in vitro vs. 8.6% in vivo). These differences could be
explained by the presence of selective pressures in the tumor
microenvironment, which are not encountered in culture
conditions.
The availability and use of both MOMP and chromatin
condensation/fragmentation reporters were useful not only
for identifying individual cells but also for temporarily
assessing the apoptotic process (Fig. 4). Under basal state

cells were MOMP-positive only, 25% only showed chromatin
condensation, and 40% underwent both MOMP and chromatin condensation. In drug-treated tumors (20% of cells
in apoptosis), apoptotic cells were seen to shift slightly in
favor of chromatin condensation states.

typically involves caspase activation followed by MOMP and subsequent

Measuring drug-induced apoptosis at the single-cell level
in vivo
We next determined whether drug treatment effects could
be monitored directly in vivo at the single-cell level (singlecell pharmacodynamics). To do this, we treated established
tumors with the Bcl-2 inhibitor, navitoclax (ABT-263), a drug
currently undergoing clinical trials both as a combination
treatment (with docetaxel, paclitaxel, erlotinib, rituximab,
gemcitabine, among others) and as a monotherapy. In
parallel, and as a comparison, we carried out similar experiments in cell culture. We found that although a single dose
of navitoclax (100 mmol/L) in vitro induced apoptosis in
nearly all MDA-MB-231-IMS/H2B cells within a 5-hour period, it only induced apoptosis in approximately 20% of PANC1-IMS/H2B cells under the same conditions (Fig. 5). These
results are consistent with earlier ﬁndings, which showed
that although EC50 values for navitoclax ranged from 0.11 to
39 mmol/L in small cell lung cancer and hematologic cancer
lines, most other solid tumors are not as responsive to
navitoclax treatment alone (13, 14).
When tested in vivo, drug-induced apoptosis was readily
identiﬁable. To approximately match the drug dose
encountered by cells in vitro (15), 100 mg/kg of navitoclax
was injected intraperitoneally into mice. Previous studies
have determined this dose to be efﬁcacious without inducing major thrombocytopenia (13, 16). Although the pancreatic and breast cancer cell lines showed divergent
behavior in vitro, apoptosis rates of the cell lines in vivo
were remarkably similar. Furthermore, apoptosis rates
in vivo plateaued at approximately 20%, a 100% increase
from basal levels. Our studies therefore indicate that both
tumor types respond to navitoclax monotherapy in vivo.
Apoptotic cells did not show any preferential distribution,
either in their distance from the tumor microvessels or
within the tumors themselves.
Comparison with exogenous stains
Drug-induced apoptosis is often measured via nongenetic
means using ﬂuorescent Annexin V or other afﬁnity ligands
(e.g., NucView). Although the Annexin V approach is particularly well-established in vitro, its validity in in vivo settings has
not yet been explored at the single-cell level. We resolved to
determine whether systemic injection of Annexin V in mice
would result in its accumulation in apoptotic cells (deﬁned by
MOMP and chromosome condensation). Interestingly, we
observed that nearly all ﬂuorescently labeled Annexin V colocalized with tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) outside of
the tumor rather than with apoptotic tumor cells (Fig. 6).
Indeed, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-stained apoptotic cells failed
to show signiﬁcant colocalization with Annexin V in vivo
(Supplementary Fig. S2). We hypothesize that dying cancer
cells recruit monocytes to the tumor site, where they differentiate into TAMs, and result in both cell types accumulating
the imaging agent. Assessment of TAMs may therefore represent an indirect means for identifying cell death for some
tumor types, reporting on the macrophage response rather
than on apoptosis directly.

signiﬁcance was determined using a 2tailed unpaired Student t test (PANC-1,
P < 0.01; MDA-MB-231, P < 0.02). The
table below compares the percentage
of cells undergoing apoptosis in culture
versus in mice, with and without drug
treatment at the speciﬁed times.

Discussion
The use of high spatial resolution imaging has become
widespread in cell biology. However, the attainment of similar
resolutions in vivo has remained challenging because of
motion, limited achievable signal-to-noise ratios, and restricted tissue penetration of light (17). In view of the ﬁndings
showing that many cellular processes and responses can

behave differently in vivo compared with in vitro, it is now
clear that the ability to image at subcellular resolution in vivo
would have important consequences. Here, we show not only
that it is practically feasible to image apoptotic events within
individual cells over time but also that it is possible to
measure drug-induced effects in the living animal. These
results are important for several reasons. First, such

In Vivo Imaging of MOMP at Single-Cell Resolution

technological advances will likely broaden the study of
apoptosis and its regulation at both the single-cell and
population-level in vivo. Second, the use of such a method
could be applied as a tool in systems pharmacology for
measuring the therapeutic effect (or failure) of drugs on
individual cells, cell populations, or cell niches. Third, if and
when combined with ﬂuorescent drugs (18, 19), this
approach could serve to improve our ability to map both
the PK and PD of drugs. Similarly, the toxicity of drugs on
nonmalignant cells could be determined in transgenic mice
that express the reporters. Finally, our ﬁndings suggest the
possibility that other cellular structures and pathways could
similarly be imaged at high spatial resolutions in vivo.
Several studies have used intravital microscopy to study
tumor immunology (20–22), microvascularity (23), and invasion and metastases (24–26), as well as cell-cycle progression
(1, 17). Many of these studies, however, used lower resolutions
to visualize cell–cell interactions or cellular movements over
time. In our investigation, because our aim was to resolve
intracellular details (not generally needed for cell tracking
studies), we required much higher spatial resolutions. We
achieved this by creating highly ﬂuorescent dual reporter lines
and then carefully optimizing the acquisition conditions.
IMS-RP is a biologically neutral reporter that lacks the IAPbinding motif. As a result, there are no biologic side effects
from overexpression of the Smac/DIABLO peptide (as there
would from expression of full-length proteins fused to ﬂuorescent proteins). Lentiviral constructs provide a rapid method for labeling cells, including primary cells. A major technical
challenge in intravital microscopy, however, is overcoming
artifacts caused by physiologic motion. In our study, to reduce
motion during prolonged imaging sessions, the window chambers of isoﬂurane-anesthetized mice were immobilized on a
heated stage, and the mice were monitored carefully throughout each experiment. Scan speeds were likewise adjusted to
reduce artifacts. To obtain a 3-dimensional representation of
the ﬁeld of view, all images were collected as z-stacks using a
high magniﬁcation water-immersion objective.
Despite numerous technological advances in intravital
imaging, there remain a number of unresolved practical issues.
First, to obtain the highest possible spatial resolution, capable
of resolving mitochondria and chromatin within cells, this
study required the use of window chamber models. In future
research, it would be interesting to extend this type of imaging
to the study of orthotopic cancers in genetically engineered
mouse models. For this to be possible, however, better immobilization strategies and optics are needed. We nevertheless
remain conﬁdent that with continuing advances in miniaturized optics (27, 28), fast scanning, and newer immobilization
techniques, such studies will ultimately be feasible. A second
area in need of improvement is in the design of reporter
constructs. For example, the use of more red-shifted (29) or
brighter ﬂuorescent proteins would increase the signal-tonoise ratio and thus facilitate image analysis. Alternatively,
the creation and use of turn-on ﬂuorescent protein reporters
that only ﬂuoresce during apoptosis would be another interesting means of obtaining information about the signaling
pathways involved in this process. Several caspase-activatable

probes have recently been described for detection of cell death
in vitro (3); but these have yet to be tested in vivo. Another area
demanding signiﬁcant attention is the development of automated image analysis and quantitation, particularly for use in
unsupervised paradigms (30–32). Finally, there is an obvious
need for deeper imaging into tumors. It is possible that this
issue could be addressed through the use of multiphoton
approaches, more red-shifted constructs, and perhaps newer
illumination schemes (33).
The in vivo studies presented here not only complement
earlier investigations in HeLa cells (2, 13, 34) but also serve to
further validate these studies in breast and pancreatic cancer
cell lines. Several important differences should nevertheless
be highlighted. For example, Spencer and colleagues primarily
used a combination of TRAIL and cycloheximide treatment to
induce cell death. In cases where TRAIL was used alone,
however, it seems the researchers required 5-fold greater
concentrations of TRAIL to induce cell death, which is comparable with the concentration used in our study to induce
cell death within a similar time frame. In addition, we also
found that the duration of MOMP in both PANC-1 and MDAMB-231 cells was similar to that seen in HeLa cells (for both,
it occurred in minutes). In this study, we used navitoclax rather
than TRAIL to induce apoptosis on the basis that this drug is
currently under investigation in clinical trials. Navitoclax
(ABT-263) is a small-molecule inhibitor of the prosurvival
Bcl-2 family of proteins, which include Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Mcl-1. From studies of small cell lung carcinoma and acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, the reported effective dose range for
navitoclax is approximately 110 nmol/L to 39 mmol/L (16). In
our own experiments, although 25 mmol/L ABT-263 was sufﬁcient to cause cell death in approximately 50% of MDA-MB231 cells, it did not cause signiﬁcant apoptosis in PANC-1 cells.
We thus increased the in vitro dose of ABT-263 to 100 mmol/L.
In summary, we believe that by continuing to make
advances in microscopic imaging and apoptotic reporter
constructs, these tools could soon have broad applications
for biology and drug development. We expect that the use of
IMS-RP, together with other genetic reporters, will not only
allow us to visualize multiple components of the apoptotic
signaling pathways (which will likely differ depending on
drug treatment/cell type) but also be useful for drug efﬁcacy
proﬁling. Naturally, such reporters will need to be applied to
the study of other forms of drug-induced cell death, for
example, by the creation of in vivo reporters for DNA damage
(35), senescence (4), autophagy (5), and necrosis, among
others (36).
