ABSTRACT
Bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP) showed superior efficacy versus MP as
first-line treatment for transplantation-ineligible multiple myeloma (MM). This study
investigated the efficacy of VMP for Korean patients with MM.
Overall, 177 MM patients received 9 cycles of VMP in this prospective, multicenter,
observational study. The primary endpoint was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS).
Thirty-nine (22%) patients were aged ≥ 75 years and 83 (47.4%) patients had
International Staging System stage III. A median of 5 cycles were delivered. Overall
response rate (ORR) was 72.9%, and complete response (CR) rate was 20.3%. With
a median follow-up of 11.9 months, median PFS was 17 months. The 2-year PFS and
overall survival (OS) rates were 29.2% and 80.0%, respectively. Median OS was not
reached. PFS was significantly different depending on performance status (Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group < 2 vs. ≥ 2; p = 0.0002), β2-microglobulin level (< 5.5 vs.
≥ 5.5 mg/L; p = 0.0481), and cumulative dose of bortezomib (< 35.1 vs. ≥ 35.1 mg/
m2; p < 0001). The common adverse events (AEs) were in line with the well-known
toxicity profiles associated with VMP.
In conclusion, VMP is a feasible and effective front-line treatment for transplantineligible older patients with MM in Korea. Continuing therapy with prompt adjustment
of treatment according to AEs may be important to improve outcomes of elderly patients.

complete response (CR) was relatively rare and median
survival was approximately 3 years [3–6]. During the past
decade, high-dose therapy with hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation has become the preferred treatment for
patients under the age of 65 years, but older patients and
patients with clinically significant comorbidities usually
do not tolerate this treatment.
With increasing incidence of MM among patients
aged ≥ 70 years, it is becoming increasingly important to
investigate treatment options in patients who are not eligible
for autologous stem cell transplantation [7]. Several recent
studies have proved the efficacy and safety of bortezomib
in patients with recurrent or refractory MM [8] and the

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a progressive plasma
cell neoplasm characterized by reduced resistance against
infection, skeletal injuries (bone pain and fracture), renal
failure, and anemia. The prognosis is mostly recurrent,
with a median survival of approximately 3 to 4 years.
Melphalan-prednisone (MP) has been the standard
therapy for patients with newly diagnosed MM for over
40 years, and is associated with a median survival of 29 to
37 months [1, 2]. Studies have shown that treatment with
MP resulted in partial response (PR) or greater responses
in approximately half of the treated patients; however,

Assessment of Proteasome inhibition for Extending
Remissions (APEX) study has demonstrated the efficacy
and safety of bortezomib as secondary therapy [9]. Based
on the results of the Velcade as Initial Standard Therapy
in Multiple Myeloma (VISTA) study, which showed a
significant difference between bortezomib plus melphalan
and prednisone (VMP) therapy compared to MP therapy in
terms of CR, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival
(OS), VMP is now recognized as a standard therapy for MM
patients aged ≥ 65 years [10]. A retrospective analysis of
the VISTA study suggested that higher cumulative doses
of bortezomib, reflecting prolonged treatment duration and/
or greater dose intensity, could lead to improved OS [11].
The incidence of MM in Korea has increased
steadily, and it is the second most common hematologic
malignancy in Korea since 2012 [12]. Currently, VMP
is the most commonly used regimen for treating patients
who are ineligible for transplantation. However, data on
the efficacy and safety of VMP therapy in Asian patients
with MM are limited.
Thus, we performed a prospective, multicenter,
observational study to investigate the clinical effectiveness
and safety of VMP treatment for Korean patients with MM.

41.6 mg/m2 during cycles 1–4 and 26 mg/m2 during
cycles 5–9. The maximum planned cumulative dose of
melphalan and prednisone was 324 mg/m2 and 2160 mg/
m2, respectively. The median number of cycles delivered
was 5 (range, 1–9), and the median cumulative dose
of bortezomib was 35.1 mg/m2. The dose intensity of
bortezomib, which is the median cumulative dose during
the initial 4 cycles, was 25.6 mg/m2 (median relative dose
intensity (RDI), 83.08%), while the median cumulative
dose intensity from cycle 5 onwards was 20.0 mg/m2
(median RDI, 87.35%). The median cumulative dose of
melphalan and prednisone was 144 mg/m2 and 1200 mg/
m2, respectively. Of 177 patients, 58 completed 9 cycles
of VMP therapy and 52 completed the 2-year follow-up.
Among 119 patients who terminated the therapy before
the end of the 9 cycles, the most common reason for
termination of therapy was adverse events (AEs) in 26
patients, death in 20 patients, disease progression in 19
patients, and initiation of the next therapy in 17 patients.
For 39 patients who were aged ≥ 75 years, the median
number of treatment cycles was 3, and the median
cumulative dose of bortezomib was 28.8 mg/m2.

Treatment response

RESULTS

Response was observed in 129 (72.9%) out of 177
patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.7%–79.3%).
Details regarding responses to treatment are shown in
Table 2. The overall response rate (ORR; stringent CR
[sCR], CR, very good partial response [VGPR], and PR)
was 72.9%, and the CR rate (sCR and CR) was 20.3%.
For 129 patients who responded to therapy, the median
time to first response was 1.6 months, mostly in cycles 1
and 2 in 84 (65.1%) and 29 (22.5%) patients, respectively.
The median time to best response was 3.4 months, mostly
in cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4, each in 38 (29.5%) patients, 29
(22.5%) patients, 25 (19.4%) patients, and 15 (11.6%)
patients, respectively (Figure 1). The median duration of
response was 17.1 months for the overall population, and
20.6 months for patients with CR.

Patient characteristics
In total, 179 patients were enrolled into this
observational study at 38 centers in Korea from May 22,
2011 to May 29, 2014, of whom 177, who received at least
1 dose of the study drug, were included in the analyses.
The study population comprised 102 (57.6%) men and 75
(42.4%) women, with a median age of 71 years; 39 (22%)
patients were aged ≥ 75 years. The most common subtype
of MM at the time of diagnosis was immunoglobulin (Ig) G
type of MM in 108 (61.0%) patients, followed by IgA type
in 43 (24.3%) patients, and IgM type in 2 (1.1%) patients.
Overall, 20 (11.3%) patients had light chain disease and 4
(2.3%) had the non-secretory type of MM. According to
the International Staging System (ISS), 22 (12.6%) patients
were in stage I, 70 (40.0%) were in stage II, and 83 (47.4%)
were in stage III (Table 1). In total, 83 (47.4%) patients
had a serum β2-microglobulin level of > 5.5 mg/L and 129
(73.7%) had glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min.
Cytogenetic test results were collected in 145 patients
at the time of diagnosis of MM. The high-risk cytogenetics
group included 24 (13.6%) patients, classified on the basis
of karyotypic deletion 13 or hypodiploidy or the presence
of deletion 17p, translocation (4;14), or translocation
(14;16) on interphase florescence in situ hybridization.

Survival data
The median follow-up duration for 177 patients
was 11.9 months. The projected 2-year progression-free
survival (PFS) rate was 29.2% (95% CI, 20.4%–38.5%),
and the median PFS was 17 months (95% CI, 13.6–19.1
months). The projected 2-year OS rate was 80.0% (95%
CI, 71.9%–85.9%) and median OS was not reached
(Figure 2). During the safety follow-up period, 26 (14.7%)
patients died.
In univariate analysis for factors affecting 2-year PFS
rate, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status (ECOG-PS) and cumulative dose of bortezomib
were significantly associated with PFS, while serum β2microglobulin concentration tended to be associated with

Treatment data
At 100% dose intensity, the maximum planned
cumulative dose of bortezomib was 67.6 mg/m2, including

PFS (Table 3). Multivariate analysis showed that ECOGPS < 2 (vs. ≥ 2), β2-microglobulin < 5.5 mg/L (vs. ≥ 5.5
mg/L), and cumulative dose of bortezomib ≥ 35.1 mg/m2
(vs. < 35.1 mg/m2) were independent predictors for longer
PFS (Table 4). β2-microglobulin < 5.5 mg/L, albumin ≥
3.5 g/L, and cumulative dose of bortezomib ≥ 35.1 mg/
m2were independent prognostic factors for OS (Table 4).
Patient age ≥ 75 years, impaired renal function, advanced
ISS stage, and high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities did not
significantly affect the PFS and OS. Figure 3 shows the
PFS and OS according to cumulative bortezomib dose (≥
35.1 vs. < 35.1 mg/m2).

53 (29.9%) patients, and nausea in 50 (28.3%) patients.
Major hematologic AEs were cytopenias; grade 3 or 4
neutropenia (14.7%), thrombocytopenia (10.7%), and
anemia (3.4%) were frequently observed (Table 5).
There were 380 dose reductions cases in 70 patients
(39.5%) during 1–9 cycles; the main cause was AEs in
65 patients (92.8%). There were 4 deaths considered
treatment-related: 4 from pneumonia, including 1 from
aspiration pneumonia.

DISCUSSION
Although the superiority of VMP over MP therapy in
transplant-ineligible MM patients was demonstrated in the
large randomized phase III VISTA study [10], prospective
studies supporting the efficacy of VMP therapy in Asian
countries are limited. This prospective multicenter study
evaluated the efficacy and safety of VMP therapy for
Korean patients with MM. Considering the potential gap
between efficacy and effectiveness of new treatments
in elderly myeloma patients, this population-based
observational study is meaningful as it reflects outcomes
in clinical practice.

Adverse events
Overall, 174 (98.3%) patients reported 2,072 AEs,
and 154 (87.0%) patients reported 1,095 adverse drug
reactions (ADRs). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were
reported by 121 (68.4%) patients (277 events). Of these,
29 AEs in 26 (14.7%) patients resulted in death. The
most common AE was diarrhea in 71 (40.1%) patients,
followed by asthenia in 66 (37.3%) patients, peripheral
neuropathy in 60 (33.9%) patients, decreased appetite in

The results were comparable to the overall efficacy
results of recently published VMP trials [10, 13–15].
Table 6 summarizes the baseline characteristics and VMP
treatment results from recently published studies [11,
14, 15]. The ORR in our study was similar to that from
previous VMP studies. However, the PFS of patients in our
study was shorter than that of patients in the VISTA study.

This discrepancy may be because patients with advanced
disease and poor performance were more common in
our population. The US community-based phase IIIB
UPFRONT study compared three frontline bortezomibbased regimens in transplant-ineligible patients with
MM. The median PFS in the UPFRONT study was 17.3
months, similar to our results [14]. This shorter PFS may

also reflect the modification of treatment or differences
between patients in the community setting. In our study,
patients received a median of 5 cycles of VMP treatment
compared to 8 cycles in the VISTA trial. The median time
to CR was similar to that in the VISTA trial. The CR rate
may be lower because the median number of treatment
cycles was lower than in other studies. Considering
that prolonged treatment might improve the quality of
response, early discontinuation of treatment may have
negatively affected the outcomes of this study.
In a phase I/II study of VMP in Japanese patients,
VMP with 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib showed an ORR of
69.8% and survival outcome was not reported. Similar
to our study, the median number of treatment cycles
was 4.5 [15]. The incidence of grade 4 neutropenia and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

thrombocytopenia was 30% and 22%, respectively.
Peripheral neuropathy was the most common cause
of discontinuation of study treatment. Owing to the
limitation of an observational study design, the frequency
and severity of AEs in our study and the UPFRONT
study seem to be mostly underestimated. However, the
incidences of herpes zoster infection and pneumonia
were highest in our study. The treatment may have been
terminated early due to AEs in both the Japanese and
Korean studies.
Post-hoc landmark analysis of the VISTA study
suggested that a higher cumulative dose of bortezomib
and continued VMP treatment following attainment of
CR might result in improved OS [11]. In our subgroup
analysis, cumulative dose of bortezomib was also

an important factor for favorable outcome. Experts
have recommended prompt dose adjustment of novel
myeloma drugs according to the patient’s condition
because continuous treatment until disease progression or
intolerability increases the depth of response and extended
survival [16]. Early adjustment of treatment according to
frailty status and AEs is essential to continue treatment
and improve outcome of patients treated with VMP
regimen. Subcutaneous injection of bortezomib showed
improvements in tolerability of treatment [17]. A less
intensive VMP regimen with weekly bortezomib schedule
was investigated to prolong treatment duration, and similar
outcomes were achieved [16, 18]. Dose reductions based
on geriatric assessment may help reduce treatment toxicity
and avoid early discontinuation of treatment [19].
Intriguingly, none of the potential prognostic factors
such as advanced age, renal impairment, and high-risk
cytogenetic profiles were found to predict survival with
VMP therapy. This is consistent with the results of previous
studies with bortezomib, suggesting that it may overcome
some of the poor prognostic impact of these factors [9–11,
13]. Although VMP therapy is a well-established standard
treatment for patients with MM who are ineligible for highdose therapy, it is not clear whether very elderly patients
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

should be treated with VMP, considering the toxicities. In
our study, there was no difference in PFS for patients who
were aged ≥ 75 years. Based on this, it is suggested that
VMP may be an effective treatment option even in very
elderly patients. Few studies have been dedicated to patients
over the age of 75 years, and currently no studies have been
designed based on frailty. Prospective studies are warranted
to improve outcomes of these populations. Recently,
alkylator-free continuous lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd)
given until disease progression showed superior PFS and OS
to melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide (MPT) in transplantineligible patients with myeloma [20]. According to the
updated results, continuous Rd also demonstrated benefits
over MPT for patients older than 75 years [21]. Currently,
both fixed duration of alklyator-combining therapy and
continuous alklyator-free regimen are considered as standard
treatment for transplant-ineligible MM patients. Further
prospective studies may clarify strategies that are more
effective for elderly patients.
This is one of the largest multicenter studies to
evaluate prospectively the efficacy of VMP therapy in
transplant-ineligible MM patients in Asian countries. VMP
therapy showed similar results as in previous studies in
Korean MM patients. We confirmed that VMP is a feasible

prompt adjustment of treatment according to AEs may be
important to improve outcomes of elderly patients.

therapy was initiated because of disease progression or
death during the 9 cycles of VMP therapy or the followup period.

Study endpoints and assessments

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The primary endpoint was the 2-year PFS rate. The
secondary endpoints were ORR, CR rate, time to response,
and OS. Response and progression were assessed by
investigators according to the International Myeloma
Working Group uniform criteria [22].
Efficacy and safety were evaluated for all subjects
who had received at least one dose of bortezomib. All
AEs were reported from the start date of bortezomib
administration to 30 days after the last administration
date. The severity of the AEs was evaluated according
to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/
protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm).
PFS was defined as the length of time from the day
of bortezomib first administration to disease progression,
relapse from CR, or death, whichever occurred first, in 2
years. OS was defined as the time between bortezomib
first administration and death. Death, regardless of the
cause, was considered as an event. Duration of response
was defined as the time from the date of first evidence
of achievement of at least a minor response until date of
disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause.

Ethics statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authors'
institutional review board.

Patients
The study population included patients with
untreated, symptomatic, measurable MM who were
not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation.
Symptomatic MM was defined as the presence of
intramedullary monoclonal plasma cells ≥ 10% or
histologically confirmed plasmacytoma, or presence of
monoclonal protein in the serum or urine, or myelomarelated organ impairment. Measurable disease was defined
as the presence of quantifiable M protein in serum or
urine for secretory MM or confirmed abnormal free light
chain ratio for non-secretory MM. The exclusion criteria
were asymptomatic MM or monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance, previous treatment for MM,
severe peripheral neuropathy (grade ≥ 2 according to
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for
Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE] version 4.0), pregnancy
or breastfeeding, mental illness, or other serious medical
conditions.

Statistical analysis
Demographic and baseline data as well as
effectiveness data were summarized using descriptive
statistics. Descriptive statistics were presented as
continuous variables, which included the mean, standard
deviation, median, and range (minimum and maximum),
and as categorical variables, which included frequencies
and their respective percentages. Time-to-event outcome,
including OS, PFS, and duration of response, was analyzed
using Kaplan–Meier method.
Differences between groups were compared using
the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical
variables and t-test for continuous variables. Survival
curves between subgroups were compared using the logrank test for univariate analysis, and multivariate analysis
was performed using Cox’s proportional hazard model for
survival. Factors with p values < 0.1 in univariate analyses
were examined using multivariate regression models.
For the multivariate analyses, a stepwise approach was
used. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with significance
defined as p < 0.05. Analyses were performed using SAS
version 9.2.

Study design and treatments
The patients received VMP treatment guided by
approved label which comprised nine 6-week cycles of
melphalan (at a dose of 9 mg/m2) and prednisone (at a
dose of 60 mg/m2) on days 1 to 4 in combination with
bortezomib (at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2) on days 1, 4, 8, 11,
22, 25, 29, and 32 during cycles 1 to 4, and on days 1, 8,
22, and 29 during cycles 5 to 9.
With one cycle consisting of 6 weeks (42 days) from
the day when VMP was started, the planned treatment
duration was up to 9 cycles, and the follow-up period was
2 years from the day when VMP was started. Considering
the observational nature of the study, doses, administration
interval, and total treatment cycles could be modified
based on the investigator’s discretion. After completion
of treatment or withdrawal of study drug (due to SAEs
or disease progression), patients were followed up for 2
years from the start of VMP treatment. Follow-up was
discontinued and considered completed when the next
