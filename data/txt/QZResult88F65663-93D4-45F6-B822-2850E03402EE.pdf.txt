Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations mediates colorectal cancer (CRC)
formation by deregulating key signaling pathways in cancer cells. In CRC, one of the most
commonly inactivated signaling pathways is the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)
signaling pathway, which is often inactivated by mutations of TGF-β type II receptor (TGFBR2).
Another commonly deregulated pathway in CRC is the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT
pathway. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is an important
negative regulator of PI3K-AKT signaling and is silenced in approximately 30% of CRC. The
combination of TGFBR2 inactivation and loss of PTEN is particularly common in microsatellite
unstable CRCs. Consequently, we determined in vivo if deregulation of these two pathways
cooperate to affect CRC formation by analyzing tumors arising in mice that lack Tgfbr2 and/or
Pten specifically in the intestinal epithelium. We found that lack of Tgfbr2 (Tgfbr2IEKO) alone is
not sufficient for intestinal tumor formation and lack of Pten (PtenIEKO) alone had a weak effect
on intestinal tumor induction. However, the combination of Tgfbr2 inactivation with Pten loss
(PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO) led to malignant tumors in both the small intestine and colon in 86.0% of
the mice and to metastases in 8.1% of the tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, these tumors arose via a
β-catenin independent mechanism. Inactivation of Tgf-β signaling and loss of Pten led to increased
cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors. Thus, inactivation of TGF-β signaling and loss of PTEN cooperate to drive intestinal
cancer formation and progression by suppressing cell cycle inhibitors.

the functionally significant genetic and epigenetic alterations that arise during the molecular
pathogenesis of CRC will help lead to the development of more effective therapies for
treating CRC.
The classic paradigm of CRC formation follows the adenoma→cancer sequence, in which
CRC begins as a benign neoplasm, called an adenoma.(2) In this classic model, the
adenomas are initiated by mutations that activate the Wnt signaling pathway (e.g. mutations
in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or beta catenin (CTNNB1)).(3–5) Adenomas can then
progress to malignancy if they acquire additional oncogenic mutations that lead to the
deregulation of other pathways, such as the RAS-RAF-MAPK and/or the
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathways.(6–8) It has also become clear
that CRCs can be classified into three classes based on the form of genomic instability that
they display: chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI), and CpG
Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP).(9) The Microsatellite Instability (MSI) class of CRC
accounts for approximately 15% of CRC and results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch
repair system. The MSI cancers often arise through a serrated polyp→cancer sequence.(10)
They have a pronounced susceptibility to PI3K inhibitors compared to other CRCs,
suggesting they are particularly dependent on the PI3K-AKT pathway.(11)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is aberrantly activated in 40% of CRC.(7) Activation of
PI3K signaling promotes cancer formation through a variety of mechanisms.(12–14)
Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is an important
negative regulator of PI3K-AKT signaling,(15) and its inactivation is a common cause of
increased PI3K activity in cancers.(16) Loss of PTEN expression occurs in 20–40% of
CRCs.(17, 18) and the MSI subtype has an especially high frequency of PTEN gene
mutations compared to CIN CRC’s.(19, 20) Notably, PTEN loss may also affect
tumorigenesis through mechanisms other than PI3K pathway activation,(21) including the
induction of genomic stability,(22) and deregulated cellular senescence.(23, 24)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Like the PI3K pathway, the TGF-β signaling pathway is commonly deregulated in human
cancers.(25, 26) The importance of TGF-β signaling inactivation in CRC is highlighted by
the high frequency of resistance to TGF-β, a multifunctional cytokine that acts as a tumor
suppressor in the colon.(27) TGF-β mediates its effects on cells through a heteromeric cell
surface receptor that consists of two obligate serine-threonine kinase components, TGF-β
receptor type I (TGFBR1) and type II (TGFBR2). In colon cancer, the mutational
inactivation of TGFBR2 is a common mechanism for inactivating the TGF-β signaling
pathway, especially in MSI CRCs.(28) Inactivation of TGFBR2 can result in the
deregulation of a multitude of cellular processes that may affect tumorigenesis.(29, 30) The
myriad of cellular processes that can be affected by TGF-β signaling inactivation raises the
question of which ones are functionally relevant for CRC formation. Furthermore, the
effects of TGF-β signaling deregulation in CRC appear to depend on the concurrent
signaling pathways that are altered in the cancer cells.(31, 32) Indeed, it is increasingly
appreciated that the TGF-β signaling pathway interacts intimately with a variety of pathways
including the Wnt-APC-β-catenin, RAS-RAF-MAPK, and PI3K-AKT pathways, and that
the interaction of these pathways may be a major factor that determines the biological
consequences of TGF-β signaling inactivation in CRC cells.(33, 34)
In light of the common co-occurrence of mutations in TGFBR2 and PTEN in CRC,
especially in MSI CRC, we generated an in vivo model to directly assess whether these
genetic alterations cooperate in intestinal cancer formation. We found that inactivation of
Tgfbr2 and loss of Pten converge to suppress cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, which may
promote intestinal cancer formation and progression in vivo.

Inactivation of Tgfbr2 alone or loss of Pten alone has little to no effect on tumor formation
in the intestinal epithelium
In order to assess the in vivo effects of TGF-β signaling inactivation and PI3K-AKT
signaling deregulation on intestinal tumorigenesis, Villin-Cre transgenic mice were bred
with mice carrying Ptenflx/flx and Tgfbr2flx/flx alleles to create three cohorts of mice: VillinCre;Tgfbr2flx/flx (no Tgfbr2 in the intestinal epithelium, designated Tgfbr2IEKO); VillinCre;Ptenflx/flx (no Pten in the intestinal epithelium, designated PtenIKEO) and VillinCre;Ptenflx/flx;Tgfbr2flx/flx (no Pten and no Tgfbr2 in the intestinal epithelium, designated
PtenIKEO;Tgfbr2IEKO). No intestinal tumors were observed in the control mice lacking
Villin-Cre (Control). Consistent with previous studies, mice that lacked Tgfbr2 in the
intestinal epithelium did not develop tumors by 54 weeks of age. This observation supports
our previous studies, suggesting that inactivation of TGF-β signaling alone is not sufficient
for intestinal tumor formation.(31, 33)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Deletion of Pten in the intestinal epithelium of PtenIKEO mice was confirmed by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an antibody specific for PTEN (Supplemental Figure
S4). PtenIKEO mice (N=39) were necropsied and examined as noted in the Methods section.
The majority of Pten-deficient mice did not have gross or microscopic abnormalities in their
intestinal epithelium, which is similar to the findings of Marsh et al and Byun et al. (35, 36)
However, unlike in the published studies, we did find gross lesions in 3 PtenIKEO mice
(Table 1). These lesions varied from mild hyperplasia (small intestine and cecum) to a single
adenocarcinoma (small intestine), which was characterized by dysplastic glands invading
into the muscularis propria. There were no large mucinous adenocarcinomas found in the
PtenIKEO mice.
Tgfbr2 inactivation in the context of Pten loss promotes intestinal tumor formation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The inactivation of TGFBR2 and loss of PTEN are common concurrent molecular events
observed in CRC, raising the possibility that deregulation of these pathways may cooperate
to promote the formation of intestinal cancer.(19, 20, 37) This possibility led us to generate
mice that were deficient for both Pten and Tgfbr2 in the intestinal epithelium
(PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO). Tgfbr2 inactivation in the context of Pten loss significantly
shortened the life span of these mice to a median survival of 36 weeks (Figure 1,
PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice compared to Tgfbr2IEKO mice, PtenIEKO mice or Control mice, P
< 0.0001 for all comparisons). A majority of PtenIEKO; Tgfbr2IEKO mice (N=37/43)
developed gross lesions, a significant increase in the number of tumor-bearing
PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice as compared to Tgfbr2IEKO mice, PtenIEKO mice or Control mice
(Table 1, P < 0.0001 for all comparisons). A total of 49 adenocarcinomas in PtenIEKO;
Tgfbr2IEKO mice were confirmed by pathology. The majority of tumors were mucinous
adenocarcinomas with transmural effacement by neoplastic glands and large lakes of tumorproduced mucin. In some cases, mucin lakes extended through the serosa and into the
serosal lymphatics. (Figure 2A) Mucinous adenocarcinomas occurred in the small intestine
(N=16, 32.7%), cecum (N=11, 22.4%), colon (N=13, 26.5%), and cecal junctions (N=9,
18.4%). (Table 2) Alcian blue staining further confirmed mucin production in the
adenocarcinomas (Supplemental Figure S1). Confirmation of the expected gene status of the
normal intestinal mucosa and tumors of the various genotypes was carried out using PCRbased assays that assess for cre-mediated recombination of the floxed alleles. (Supplemental
Figure S2) (33, 38)
Notably, 8.1% of the tumor-bearing PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice were found to have
metastases within the adjacent mesentery, pancreas, and peritoneal cavity (body wall, uterus,

and prostate). A single mouse did have metastasis to the liver with intravascular neoplastic
cells. (Figure 2B–C) Thus, metastases were confirmed histologically and appeared to occur
both via intravascular and transcoelomic routes. The metastases were also assessed with
Alcian blue staining, E-cadherin immunostaining, and by PCR for the recombined Tgfbr2flx
alleles to confirm that they were derived from the primary mucinous adenocarcinomas.
(Figure 2D–F)
Thus, inactivation of Tgfbr2 with loss of Pten in the intestinal epithelium results in the
formation of adenocarcinomas in the small intestine, cecum, and colon. The presence of
metastases in some of the mice suggests that loss of TGF-β signaling contributes to
ametastatic phenotype in the context of Pten loss.(39)
Signaling pathway deregulation in the tumors arising in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice
We first confirmed that the neoplastic cells in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice did not express
Pten by IHC. (Figure 3B) Since PTEN exerts tumor suppressive functions by inhibiting the
PI3K-AKT pathway, we analyzed the activation status of the PI3K-AKT pathway by IHC
using antibodies specific for phospho-AKT Serine 473 (Ser473). We observed neoplastic
epithelial cells in PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice had increased nuclear phosphorylated Akt
Ser473 compared to the normal intestinal epithelium. (Figure 3C)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, we assessed the phosphorylation status of Akt at both Thr308 and Ser473 in the
normal intestinal mucosa and tumors of the mice by immunoblotting. (Figure 3E) We
detected total Akt but not phospho-Akt in the normal mucosa of the wild-type control mice,
which is consistent with previous reports.(35) Of interest, a modest increase in phospho-Akt
(Ser473), but not Thr308, was detected in the normal mucosa of the Tgfbr2IEKO mice,
indicating that inactivation of TGF-β signaling leads to phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in
the setting of intact Pten. This is presumably secondary to indirect effects of loss of Tgfbr2
and was unexpected in light of prior studies in epithelial cells that showed that TGF-β
signaling can induce Akt phosphorylation at Ser473.(40) Increased Akt phosphorylation
levels at both Thr308 and Ser473 sites were observed in the normal mucosa of Ptendeficient mice compared to wild-type mice. However, we observed less phosphorylated Akt
in the tumors from the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice compared to the normal mucosa, even
though total Akt levels were increased in the tumors. (Figure 3E, right panel) These results
raise the possibility of negative feedback regulation occurring in the tumors and suggest that
a reduction in PI3K activity is selected for during intestinal cancer formation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We also assessed the activation status of the MAPK signaling pathway in the normal
intestinal mucosa and tumors because this signaling pathway is often induced in human
CRC and can be regulated by TGF-β.(41) We found that the MAPK pathway, as measured
by phospho-ERK1/2, was activated at a basal state of the normal mucosa of the control mice
and the Tgfbr2IEKO mice. (Figure 3F, left panel) In contrast to increased Akt
phosphorylation, less MAPK activation was observed in the majority of normal mucosa
samples of the Pten-deficient mice, regardless of theTgfbr2 status, and there was also more
inter-individual variation in the PtenIEKO mice compared to the control mice. (Figure 3F,
right panel) Despite there being less ERK activation in the normal intestines of the mice
lacking Pten, we observed increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the tumors when compared
to normal mucosa in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice, indicating that the MAPK pathway is
upregulated in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO tumors. To determine if somatic oncogenic Kras
mutations are responsible for the increased MAPK pathway activation in the tumors from
the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice, we sequenced the tumors for Kras mutations. However, we
did not detect mutations in Kras (codons 12, 13 or 61) in any of PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO
tumors assayed (N=5).

The intestinal tumors in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice arise independently of the canonical
Wnt-β-catenin pathway

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the high frequency of APC and CTNNB1 mutations and subsequent Wnt pathway
activation in human CRC and the fact that loss of Tgfbr2 or Pten alone does not appear to be
sufficient to initiate intestinal tumor formation,(26) we assessed the activation state of the
Wnt signaling pathway in the tumors arising in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice. In addition,
the Wnt pathway was of interest in light of conflicting data regarding its role in initiating
tumor formation in the setting of Pten deficiency.(35, 36, 42, 43) The activation state of the
Wnt signaling pathway was assessed by determining the nuclear localization status of βcatenin. (Figure 3D) The membrane-bound localization of β-catenin was observed in 75% of
the PtenIEKO tumors analyzed (N=4) and in 100% of the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO tumors
analyzed (N=10). We only observed nuclear localization of β-catenin in one adenoma from a
PtenIEKO mouse (Supplemental Figure S4), which we presume was secondary to a somatic
event in the tumor with subsequent activation of Wnt signaling. We also analyzed the levels
of Wnt target genes, Axin2 and Cd44, by qRT-PCR.(44–46) We did not observe a significant
up-regulation of these Wnt target genes in the tumors arising in PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice
as compared to the normal intestinal epithelial tissue from the PtenIEKO, Tgfbr2IEKO or
PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice. (P = 0.45 for Axin2; P = 0.33 for Cd44, Supplemental Figure
S5) Overall, these results suggest that the canonical Wnt-β-catenin pathway is not activated
in these mice.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Inactivation of Tgfbr2 and Pten loss do not cooperate to induce tumor formation through
effects on genomic stability
Both PTEN and TGF-β signaling have been implicated in the control of genomic stability.
(47) Thus, we assessed the tumors for aneuploidy using microarray comparative genomic
hybridization (array CGH) (N=3). However, we found no chromosomal gains or losses in
the tumors. (Supplemental Figure S6) These results demonstrate that these tumors do not
have gross chromosomal abnormalities representative of chromosomal instability and also
do not reveal a common locus that is altered somatically in the tumors. The identification of
a commonly deleted or amplified locus would have indicated a possible somatic event that
was cooperating with loss of TGFBR2 and PTEN to drive tumor formation in the
PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice.
Deregulation of cell cycle control proteins in PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mouse tumors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In light of the increased MAPK pathway signaling in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO tumors, we
assessed tumor cell proliferation (by Ki-67 immunostaining) to determine if enhanced
proliferation is one of the biological effects driving tumor formation in the
PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice. (Figure 4A) We observed that a substantial portion of the
neoplastic cells in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice were positive for Ki67 staining (average
percent positive cells/tumor = 50.0% ± 26%). As both PI3K-AKT and TGF-β pathways have
been implicated in the induction of apoptosis, we also assessed apoptosis in tumors from the
PtenIEKO and PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice by cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining. (Figure 4B)
We found neoplastic glands in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice had very little cleaved
caspase-3 staining. We also assessed cleaved caspase-3 by immunoblotting and observed
decreased cleaved caspase-3 protein level in the tumors arising in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO
mice compared to the normal mucosa in the other mouse cohorts. (Supplemental Figure S7)
These results suggest that increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis contribute to the
formation of the tumors in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice.
Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p15INK4B, p21CIP1 and p27KIP1 are welldocumented target genes of the TGF-β signaling pathways.(48–50) They play an essential
role in the control of the cell cycle and proliferation and their expression is often decreased

in cancer.(51–53) Therefore, we assessed the levels of Cdkn2b/p15Ink4b, Cdkn1a/p21Cip1
and Cdkn1b/p27Kip1 mRNA by qRT-PCR in the matched normal and tumor tissue. (Figure
4C) Expression of all three CDK inhibitors genes was significantly lower in the tumor
samples compared to the matched normal epithelium (for all comparisons, P < 0.02).
Furthermore, we analyzed the protein levels by immunoblot. (Figure 4D) Expression of
p15Ink4b, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 proteins was detected in the normal mucosa of various
genotypes regardless of Pten and Tgfbr2 status. Comparison of protein levels between
normal and tumor tissue from PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice revealed significantly decreased
expression of p15INK4B, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 in the tumor tissue (T) compared to normal
tissue (N) (* P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test, N=3). These results reveal a marked decrease in
expression of CDK inhibitors in tumors, suggesting this is a tumor-promoting biological
consequence resulting from the cooperation of inactivation of Tgfbr2 and loss of Pten.
Reconstitution of PTEN and TGFBR2 cooperate to induce p21Cip1 expression in human
colon cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to assess the causal role of PTEN and TGFBR2 in the regulation of the CDK
inhibitors, we reconstituted PTEN and/or TGFBR2 in the SNU-C4 colon cancer cell line, a
human CRC cell line with both mutant PTEN and TGFBR2.(54) We then evaluated the
SNU-C4 cells for p21CIP1 promoter activation using the p21Pδ2.1-luc reporter, a p21CIP1
promoter containing the minimal TGF-β response elements (55). As shown in Figure 5,
reconstitution of TGFBR2 in SNU-C4 cells induced expression of the p21Pδ2.1-luc reporter
by 4-fold compared to control vector. Similarly, reconstitution of PTEN alone induced a 3fold increase in luciferase activity. Reconstitution with both wild-type TGFBR2 and PTEN
further induced the expression of p21Pδ2.1-luc by 10-fold. To confirm the specificity of the
cooperation between TGFBR2 and PTEN on the transcriptional activation of p21CIP1, we
assessed the effect of reconstituted PTEN and TGFBR2 on activating the 3TP-lux luciferase
reporter, which assesses TGF-β pathway activation. Reconstitution of the SNU-C4 cells with
PTEN alone did not induce 3TP-lux activity. (Figure 5, Supplemental Figure S8)
Furthermore, there was no further increase in the luciferase activity of the 3TP-lux reporter
in TGFBR2 and PTEN co-transfected cells compared to TGFBR2-transfected alone cells,
indicating the additive effect of PTEN and TGFBR2 on p21CIP1 transcription activation is
specific for p21CIP1. These results suggest deregulated cell cycle proteins are likely
downstream mediators through which inactivation of TGFBR2 and loss of PTEN cooperate
to promote tumor formation and progression.

Discussion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It is widely appreciated that the majority of CRC develop as a consequence of the
progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in evolving clones of tumor
cells.(9) The Cancer Genome Atlas Network (TCGA) recently completed whole exome
sequencing of 224 CRCs and found components in the TGF-β and PTEN/PI3K/AKT
pathways were frequent mutational targets.(26) A major challenge emerging from cancer
genome sequencing projects, like the TCGA study described above, is how to determine
which of the mutations found in the tumors are “drivers” of cancer formation and which are
“passengers”. Some of these mutations have been studied in cancer cell lines, but their
relevance to in vivo tumor initiation and progression is not clear. Consequently, we
generated the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice to study the effect of deregulation of these two
pathways on cancer formation in vivo.
Deregulation of the PTEN/PI3K-AKT pathway has been associated with the growth and
progression of CRC.(56, 57) Loss of PTEN appears to be the most common mechanism for
deregulating the PI3K pathway, but little is known regarding the specific mechanisms

through which PTEN loss mediates its effects in vivo on colon cancer formation. Our studies
and previously published studies now identify potential functional consequences of loss of
PTEN in driving tumor formation in the intestines, and demonstrate the importance of gene
cooperation in the formation of CRC. (35, 42, 58) Using mice that lack Pten in the intestinal
epithelium, we found phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 was increased in
the normal intestinal epithelial cells of Pten-deficient mice. This finding is consistent with
the role of PTEN as a negative regulator of PI3K-AKT activity.(15, 59) However, the loss of
PTEN alone had weak tumor promoting effects in the intestines, which suggests that for
effective tumorigenesis, deregulation of the PI3K pathway requires the cooperation of other
deregulated pathways. Our results differ from those of a recent published study in which
mice expressing a dominantly active Pik3ca transgene spontaneously developed metastatic
intestinal cancer.(60) Potential explanations for the common spontaneous development of
tumors in their mouse model are the use of the Pi3kca* transgene, which is a dominant
active form of Pi3kca p110α, and the use of mice in a different genetic background than the
mice in our studies.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In light of the modest effect of PTEN loss on intestinal tumor formation and because
mutational inactivation of TGFBR2 is often concurrent with loss of PTEN in human
CRC(9), we proposed that the TGF-β and PI3K pathways may cooperate to drive CRC
formation. The results of this study in which we observed a substantial increase in
adenocarcinoma formation in mice lacking both Pten and Tgfbr2 provide support for this
idea. However, it is worth noting that the majority of tumor-bearing mice developed 1–2
adenocarcinoma, indicating low tumor multiplicity in these mice. Therefore, we propose that
additional cooperating events are needed for the initiation of intestinal tumors in the
PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice. Along these lines, it is interesting that there is no evidence of
Wnt pathway activation in the tumors in this mouse model. The recently identified
“hypermutated class” of CRCs found by TCGA also often lack APC mutations(26), which
raises the possibility that the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mouse model may recapitulate features
of this newly described class of CRC. Further studies of this class of human CRC may
provide insight into the nature of the additional somatic events occurring in the
PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mouse tumors and will also allow a determination of how well the
PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice model the hypermutated class of CRC.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

After observing cooperation between inactivation of Tgfbr2 and loss of Pten on intestinal
tumor formation, we investigated potential mechanisms that could be driving this effect.
One potential mechanism revealed by our studies is the deregulation of CDK inhibitor
expression. Inactivation of Tgfbr2 and Pten loss resulted in marked suppression of cyclin
dependent kinase inhibitors in the tumor cells. Consistent with loss of CDK inhibitor
expression, we observed increased proliferation in these tumors, which has also been
observed in MSI CRCs.(61) These results suggest that inhibition of CRC development by
PTEN and TGFBR2 is due in part to the collaborative regulation of cell cycle proteins.
Consistent with this possibility, we observed that reconstitution of PTEN and TGFBR2 had
an additive effect on inducing p21CIP1 expression in human cancer cells.
Our studies suggest that the loss of CDK inhibitors is a significant mechanism through
which PTEN and TGFBR2 inactivation promotes intestinal cancer formation. We have not
yet identified a mechanism through which inactivation of Tgfbr2 and loss of Pten may be
affecting expression of CDK inhibitors, but candidate mechanisms include alterations in
Pik3r1 activity or in activin signaling.(56, 62–65) Furthermore, there are additional
candidate biological effects through which Tgfbr2 inactivation and PTEN loss may promote
intestinal tumor formation. For instance, we observed the loss of senescence markers p19Arf
and Dcr2 in PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO tumors. (Supplemental Figure S9) Senescence functions
as a barrier to oppose tumorigenesis and can be triggered by a variety of mechanisms

including the activation of oncogenic pathways or the loss of PTEN.(66–68) AKT activation
has been shown to induce senescence through mechanisms involving p27Kip1 in prostate
cancer.(69) Thus, it is possible that Tgfbr2 inactivation may help tumor cells escape Ptenloss induced senescence, which could be another cooperative mechanism that drives the
tumor progression in the PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice. Further studies are needed to assess
this possibility.
In summary, we have generated an in vivo mouse model to assess whether cooperation
between two frequent events found in human colon cancer, TGFBR2 mutations and PTEN
loss, plays a functional role in the molecular pathogenesis of CRC. Our results provide
evidence that the cooperative interactions between inactivation of TGFBR2 and loss of
PTEN converge on deregulating CDK inhibitors to promote tumorigenesis in CRC. These
findings raise the possibility that agents targeted at the cyclin:CDK enzyme complexes may
be particularly effective in CRCs that carry TGFBR2 mutations and lack PTEN expression.
Furthermore, our mouse model recapitulates molecular features seen in a subset of CRC
(“hypermutated class” of CRC) and has the potential for use as a pre-clinical model for CRC
to test novel therapeutic targets.

Generation and characterization of Villin-Cre; Ptenflx/flx;Tgfbr2flx/flx mice
The generation of the following genetically engineered mice has been previously described:
Villin-Cre;Tgfbr2flx/flx (Tgfbr2IEKO) and Ptenflx/flx (33, 38). The Tgfbr2IEKO and Ptenflx/flx
mice were mated to generate the following genotypes: Villin-Cre; Ptenflx/flx;Tgfbr2wt/wt
(PtenIEKO), and Villin-Cre;Ptenflx/flx;Tgfbr2flx/flx (PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO). The floxed Tgfbr2
(Tgfbr2flx/flx) and Villin-Cre mice were maintained on C57BL/6J background. Prior to
generating the mice with the multiple mutant genotypes, Ptenflx/flx mice were backcrossed
onto a C57BL/6J background for at least five generations to obtain mice that are >90%
C57BL/6J. Thus, the background strain of experimental mice was predominantly C57BL/6J
with a small proportion of 129Sv. Mice were fed ad libitum with a standard rodent diet.
Mice were harvested at 54 weeks of age, or earlier if moribund. The studies were approved
by the local IACUC.

Mouse tissues were handled as previously described.(33, 34). Briefly, the small intestine,
cecum, and colon were removed, opened, flushed with cold PBS and then examined grossly
for tumors. Grossly visible tumors were measured and collected for histopathology. All
major organs were examined for gross lesions, and mesenteric lymph nodes, lungs, liver
were collected and evaluated histologically in all the mice. Gross lesions suspected to be
metastases were confirmed histologically by S.K. The tissues were either snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 C for RNA and protein extractions or fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) for 3–7 days, transferred to 70%
ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4 μm sections for H&E staining or
immunostaining.
Immunoblotting
Protein lysates were obtained using standard methods and then resolved by SDS-PAGE gels
and transferred to PVDF membranes (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Densitometric
quantification of immunoblots was performed using the ImageJ 1.43 software. The
following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-p44/42 total MAPK (ERK1/2) (1:1000,
#9102 Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (phosphoERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204, 1:2000, #4370 Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-pAKT (Ser473,

rabbit anti-p27Kip1 (1:1,000, kindly provided by Dr. Matthew Fero), rabbit anti-p19Arf
(1:1,000, PC435 Calbiochem®, EMD Biosciences, Billerica, MA), rabbit anti-Dcr2 (1:1,000,
Ab2019, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), goat anti-β-Actin (1:5,000, SC-1616 Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP
(1:5,000, #SC-2004, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP (1:5,000,
#SC-2020, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
Hemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Alcian blue staining, Ki67, β-catenin, and E-cadherin
immunohistochemical assays were performed in the Experimental Histopathology Core at
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center following routine laboratory protocol. Specific
protocols are available upon request.
Comparative genomic hybridization

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Acquired gains and losses of chromosomal material were assessed by microarray
comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). Three tumors from three individual mice
were analyzed. Matched non-neoplastic reference DNA was obtained from the spleen from
each mouse to minimize detection of constitutional copy number variants. Analysis was
performed as previously described.(34)
Sequencing analysis of Kras gene mutation
Genomic DNA was isolated from normal intestinal mucosa and tumors using DNeasy Blood
& Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Amplification of Kras exon1&2 was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as
previously described.(70)
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

mRNA was extracted from snap-frozen tissues using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY) following the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was generated using standard
procedures using oligodT primers (Life Technologies). TaqMan gene expression assays
(Assays-on-Demand; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for p15Ink4b (Cdkn2b,
Mm00483241_m1), p21Cip1 (Cdkn1a, Mm00432448_m1), p27Kip1(Cdkn1b,
Mm00438168_m1) and β-glucuronidase (Gusb, Mm01197698_m1) were used for qRTPCR. The assays were performed using the Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR systems (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The results of the qRT-PCR assays were normalized to β-glucuronidase
(Gusb). Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism version 4.00 software.
The Mann-Whitney test was used for comparisons of quantitative results from the qRT-PCR
assays. A P value of <0.05 was regarded as significant.
Tissue culture
The human colon cancer cell line SNU-C4 was generously provided by the Korean Cell
Line Bank (Dr. Ja-Lok Ku, Seoul, Korea) and grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT).
Plasmid transfection experiments
Transfections were performed using FuGene9 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. The pCMV5-TGFBR2 expression vector, which carries HA tagged

wild-type TGFBR2, was kindly provided by Joan Massagué (Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center, New York, NY). An expression vector containing the human PTEN open
reading frame pORF9-hPTEN was purchased from Invivo Gen (San Diego, CA).
Luciferase reporter assay
SNU-C4 cells were transiently transfected with the p21Pδ2.1 reporter (kindly provided by
Xiaofan Wang, Duke University, Durham, NC) or p3TP-lux reporter (kindly provided by
Joan Massagué, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) concomitantly
with the pRL-TK reporter construct (Promega, Madison, WI), which expresses Renilla
luciferase. Subsequently, the cells were treated with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml), and luciferase
activity was evaluated 48h after transfection using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega) with a Veritas luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA).
Luciferase activities were normalized based on Renilla luciferase activity.

Figure 1. Inactivation of Tgf-β signaling and loss of Pten lead to markedly reduced survival

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Kaplan-Meier analysis reveals a median survival of 36 weeks in PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice
(N=43). A significant decrease in the survival of PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice was observed
compared to Tgfbr2IEKO mice, PtenIEKO mice or Control mice (P < 0.0001, log-rank test, for
all comparisons). There was no significant difference in survival when the Tgfbr2IEKO mice
or PtenIEKO mice were compared to Control mice (P > 0.1 for both comparisons, log-rank
test). Of note, all mice that survived to 54 weeks of age were sacrificed at that age.

(A) Low-power image of a representative colonic mucinous adenocarcinoma from a
PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mouse (H&E, original magnification: 20X). There is transmural
effacement by neoplastic glands and large lakes of tumor-produced mucin. In some cases,
mucin lakes extend through the serosa and into the serosal lymphatics. The inset was taken
from the boxed region in (A) at higher magnification and the arrow points to intravascular
neoplastic cells within the primary colonic mucinous adenocarcinoma (H&E, original
magnification: 200X). (B) Low-power image of a liver section reveals intravascular
neoplastic cells (H&E, original magnification: 100X). The inset was taken from the boxed
region in (B) at higher magnification and the arrow points to the intravascular neoplastic
cells (H&E, original magnification, 200X). (C) Low-power image of a mesenteric metastasis
arising from a PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mouse (H&E, original magnification: 40X). The inset
was taken from the boxed region in (C) at higher magnification to show the neoplastic
glands and mucin production (H&E, original magnification: 200X). (D) Low-power image
of Alcian blue stained section of the same mesenteric metastasis shown in panel C (Alcian
blue stain, original magnification: 40X). The inset was taken from the boxed region in (D) at
higher magnification to show the mucin production in this metastasis (Alcian blue stain,
original magnification: 200X). (E) E-cadherin immunostaining of the same mesentery
metastasis shown in (C) (E-cadherin IHC, original magnification: 40X). The inset was taken
from the boxed region in (E) at higher magnification to demonstrate strong expression of Ecadherin, consistent with the epithelial origin of this metastasis (original magnification:
200X). (F) PCR genotyping results demonstrate the recombination of the Tgfbr2flx allele in

Figure 3. Signaling pathway deregulation in PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO tumors

(A) Low-power image of a representative intestinal adenocarcinoma from a
PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mouse (H&E, original magnification: 20X). The boxed region in (A)
is shown at higher magnification in the adjacent photomicrographs of immunostained tissue.
Neoplastic epithelial cells in PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice show (A) decreased PTEN
expression by PTEN immunostaining and (B) increased Akt activation by phospho-Akt
(Ser473) immunostaining. The invasive front of a representative adenocarcinoma shows (C)
membrane-bound β-catenin. (A–C, original magnification 200X). (D) Upper level, analysis
of activation of Akt by immunoblotting of lysates from normal mucosa of wild-type (WT)
control and Tgfbr2IEKO mice (left panel); in normal mucosa of PtenIEKO mice, normal
mucosa and tumors from PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO mice (right panel). β-actin was used as a
loading control. Middle level and lower level, relative Akt phosphorylation levels at Thr308

Figure 5. Reconstitution of TGFBR2 and PTEN induce p21CIP1 expression in colon cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Stimulation of p21Pδ2.1 reporter luciferase activity in the colon cancer cell line SNU-C4
transfected with empty vector (EV), TGFBR2, PTEN, or both TGFBR2 and PTEN.
Transfected SNU-C4 cells were treated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml). Histograms represent relative
luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase reporter activity. The error bars represent
the standard error from three independent experiments. The 3TP-lux luciferase reporter was
used to confirm the specificity of the cooperation between TGFBR2 and PTEN on the
activation of p21CIP1 luciferase reporter. Reconstitution of the SNU-C4 cells with PTEN
alone did not induce 3TP-lux activity. Furthermore, there was no increase in the luciferase
activity of the 3TP-lux reporter in TGFBR2 and PTEN co-transfected cells compared to
TGFBR2-transfected alone cells, indicating the specificity of the additive effect of PTEN
and TGFBR2 on p21CIP1 expression.
