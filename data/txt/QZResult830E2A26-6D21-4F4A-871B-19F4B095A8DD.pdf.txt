ABSTRACT
Artemisinins, endoperoxide-containing molecules, best known as antimalarials,
have potent antineoplastic activity. The established antimalarial, artesunate (AS),
and the novel artemisinin-derived trioxane diphenylphosphate dimer 838 (ART-838)
inhibited growth of all 23 tested acute leukemia cell lines, reduced cell proliferation
and clonogenicity, induced apoptosis, and increased intracellular levels of reactive
oxygen species (ROS). ART-838 was 88-fold more potent that AS in vitro, inhibiting
all leukemia cell lines at submicromolar concentrations. Both ART-838 and AS
cooperated with several established antileukemic drugs and newer kinase inhibitors
to inhibit leukemia cell growth. ART-838 had a longer plasma half-life than AS in
immunodeficient NOD-SCID-IL2Rgnull (NSG) mice, remaining at effective antileukemic
concentrations for >8h. Intermittent cycles of ART-838 inhibited growth of acute
leukemia xenografts and primagrafts in NSG mice, at higher potency than AS. Based
on these preclinical data, we propose that AS, with its established low toxicity and
low cost, and ART-838, with its higher potency and longer persistence in vivo, should
be further developed toward integration into antileukemic regimens.

to inhibit cancers by mechanisms that differ from those
of established antineoplastic agents, and chemotherapyresistant leukemia and neuroblastoma cell lines remain
sensitive to artemisinins [2, 5, 6]. The accepted basis for
both the antimicrobial and the antineoplastic activity
of artemisinins is bioactivation of the endoperoxide
pharmacophore(s) by heme iron to carbon-centered radicals,
resulting in ROS generation via the electron transport chain
and subsequent apoptosis [6–15].
Although first-generation artemisinin derivatives
such as AS have enhanced antimalarial and antineoplastic

INTRODUCTION
Artemisinin, a natural antimalarial compound, is the
active component of the sweet wormwood plant (Artemisia
annua L.) used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat
fevers [1]. Numerous artemisinin analogs with improved
pharmacological properties have been developed, and
artesunate (AS) is the World Health Organizationrecommended treatment for severe malaria. Artemisinins
also inhibit growth of a broad range of microbes and cancer
cells, especially leukemias [2–4]. Artemisinins appear

activity compared to natural artemisinin, they are
rapidly catabolized in vivo to the active metabolite
dihydroartemisinin (DHA), which is then glucuronidated
and excreted [16]. The novel semi-synthetic artemisininderived trioxane diphenylphosphate dimer 838 (ART-838)
exhibits greater antineoplastic and antiviral activity than
monomeric AS [8, 11, 17–21]. In our recent structureactivity relationship study of artemisinin trioxane
dimers, we identified ART-838 as an exquisitely potent
antileukemic drug, with a nearly 70-fold lower IC50 than
that of AS against Jurkat T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (T-ALL) cells [22]. In addition, we demonstrated
a favorable therapeutic window for ART-838, wherein
it inhibited growth of leukemia cells but not normal
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, similar to results of
ART-838 in solid tumor cell lines compared to normal
fibroblasts [11].
In this study, we demonstrated in vitro efficacy of
AS and ART-838 against 23 human acute leukemia cell
lines and involvement of iron-dependent ROS generation
in these anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects.
ART-838 had superior pharmacokinetics (PK) following
oral administration to mice than AS. Treatment with AS
or ART-838 inhibited in vivo growth of human AML
xenografts and B-precursor ALL (B-ALL) primagrafts, and
AS and ART-838 potentiated the in vitro anti-proliferative
effects of 6 established or emerging antileukemic drugs.
Since AS is inexpensive and established as safe in humans
through extensive use against malaria, it is a promising
current candidate to be repurposed for acute leukemia
treatment. Although further preclinical and clinical testing
will be required for ART-838, this new compound offering
higher potency and extended in vivo half-life might replace
AS in the future.

evident over 96h at 0.1 μM and 1 μM ART-838, as well
as 1 μM and 10 μM AS (Supplementary Figure S3). At the
same concentrations, near complete growth inhibition was
observed within 24-48h in the highly sensitive KOPN8 and
MOLM14 cell lines.
Similar to the above results from bulk population
assays, ART-838 was considerably more potent than AS
in reducing leukemia clonogenicity. ART-838 (0.1 µM)
completely abolished, and AS (10 µM) substantially
reduced, clonogenicity of MOLM14 and MV-4-11 cells
(Figure 1B); ART-838 and AS also reduced clonogenicity
of K562 and HL-60 cells (Supplementary Figure S4). In
contrast, treatment with 1 µM ART-838 or 10 µM AS
reduced normal erythroid and monogranulocytic colonyforming cells by <25% (Supplementary Figure S5A, S5B).

ART-838, like AS, inhibited cell cycle progression
and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis
Cell cycling was assessed in MOLM14 AML cells
treated with 0.1 µM ART-838 or 5 µM AS for 24h. These
concentrations caused 90-99% growth inhibition by 48h
in alamarBlue assays (Supplementary Figure S6). By
24h, both ART-838 and AS caused significant reductions
in S-phase cells (38% in vehicle-treated cells vs <7% in
ART-838- or AS-treated cells; Figure 2) accompanied by
significant increases in sub-G1-phase (2% vs >10%) and
G1-phase (47% vs >61%) cells.

ART-838, like AS, induced caspase-dependent
apoptosis
AS (5 µM) induced significant apoptosis and
caspase-3/7 activation in MOLM14 cells (Figure 3A, 3B),
as previously demonstrated in T-ALL cell lines [7]. Similar
levels of apoptosis and caspase-3/7 activity were achieved
with a 50-fold lower ART-838 concentration. Pretreatment
with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD(OMe)-fmk (z-VAD)
inhibited caspase-3/7 activity and apoptosis in ART-838treated and AS-treated cells. ART-838 and AS similarly
inhibited cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis of
KOPN8 B-ALL cells (not shown).

RESULTS
ART-838, like AS, potently inhibited acute
leukemia growth and clonogenicity
ART-838 inhibited growth of all 23 leukemia
cell lines tested (IC50 range: 0.01-0.55 µM; Figure 1A,
Supplementary Table S1). ART-838 was 11-315-fold
(average 88-fold) more potent than AS (IC50 range:
0.46-10.3 µM), but ART-838 and AS IC50s significantly
correlated (Supplementary Figure S1, p<.01). Overall,
AML and ALL cell lines were equally sensitive to ART838, while AMLs were slightly more sensitive to AS than
were ALLs (Figure 1A). Cell lines harboring mixed lineage
leukemia gene rearrangements (MLLr) were slightly but
not significantly more sensitive to both ART-838 and AS
than cell lines without MLLr (Supplementary Figure S2).
The presence of p53 mutations did not correlate with
drug sensitivity to either ART-838 or AS (Supplementary
Table S1). Time-dependent growth inhibition of the
moderately sensitive SEM and THP-1 cell lines was

Iron and ROS contributed to the antileukemic
activity of ART-838 and AS
Consistent with the importance of the endoperoxides
for ART-838’s antileukemic activity, IC50s for an ART838 derivative lacking both endoperoxides were >1000fold higher than those for ART-838 against both KOPN8
and MOLM14 cells (deoxy-ART-838, Supplementary
Table S3). In addition, both ART-838 (0.1 µM) and AS (5
µM) significantly increased total cellular ROS levels in
MOLM14 cells (Figure 3C).

and reduced apoptosis by AS and ART-838 (Figure 3C,
3D). The ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC; 25
µM) significantly reduced ROS generation and apoptosis
by ART-838 and AS (Figure 3C, 3D). MOLM14 cells
pretreated with DFO or NAC gained 9- or 3-fold resistance
to growth inhibition by AS respectively (Figure 3E). The
same pretreatment with DFO induced 3-fold resistance to
ART-838, but resistance to ART-838 was not increased
by the NAC pretreatment (Figure 3F). Since pretreatment
with >25 µM NAC, alone, caused significant inhibition of
MOLM14 cell growth, we could not examine the effect of
higher NAC concentrations on sensitivity to the more potent
ART-838. Nevertheless, the lack of inhibition of ART-838mediate antileukemic efficacy by this standard dose of NAC
suggests that mechanisms beyond ROS might be important
in the antileukemic activity of ART-838.

administration of a single 50 mg/kg oral dose to NSG
mice (Supplementary Table S4). ART-838’s plasma
half-life (T1/2) was >3h, with plasma concentrations
remaining above the MOLM14 in vitro IC50 for
>8h (Figure 4A). ART-838’s in vivo metabolites are
unknown; DHA was one theoretical metabolite, as was
the parent compound, ART-606 (a dimeric artemisinin
linked by one carbon that would result if the diphenyl
phosphate ester group were lost in vivo) [11]. However,
we did not detect DHA or ART-606 after ART-838
administration. The total ART-838 exposure based on
the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from
time zero to the last concentration above the detection
limit (AUClast) was 903 h*ng/ml. In contrast, AS was
rapidly metabolized to DHA [23, 24], which had a T1/2
<1h, and AS and DHA declined to undetectable levels by
1h and 4h, respectively (Figure 4B). Cmax for AS (67 ng/
ml; 0.24 µM) and DHA (1629 ng/ml; 5.74 µM) occurred
0.25h after oral administration (Supplementary Table
S4). DHA levels remained above the MOLM14 in vitro
IC50 for ~2h.

A. 23 human leukemia cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of ART-838 or AS for 48h, and then cytotoxicity was assessed
via fluorescent alamarBlue assay. Following subtraction of background fluorescence from all wells, fluorescence of drug-treated cells was
normalized to that of vehicle (<0.5% DMSO)-treated cells to determine the effect of each drug concentration on viability. Each cell line was
tested in triplicate and in at least three independent experiments. IC50 (concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50%) values were calculated
using CompuSyn software (ComboSyn, Paramus, NJ). All IC50s were determined using cells cultured in RPMI containing 10% FBS. In
addition several cell lines were initially cultured and tested in alternative media (Supplementary Table S2). Bisecting lines indicate mean

were enumerated. Colony counts were normalized to vehicle-treated controls (100%). Three independent experiments were performed.

weight loss following treatment was observed (Figure 5D).
Although all mice eventually developed severe leukemia,
with massive splenomegaly, pale bone marrow, and
replacement of hematopoietic organs with human B-ALL
cells, ART-838 or AS treatment significantly delayed
leukemia onset (Figure 5C). ART-838 treatment extended
mean survival time by 20 days (55% prolongation), and the
4-fold higher dose AS regimen extended mean survival time
by 19 days (51% prolongation). In a second experiment, a
slightly different treatment schedule (two 5-day cycles of
ART-838 [50 mg/kg/d] or AS [200 mg/kg/d] beginning on
days 1 and 29 post-transplantation) delayed leukemia to a
similar extent (Supplementary Figure S9).

NSG mice were transplanted with MOLM14 cells
subcutaneously (sc) (day 0) and, beginning on days 1 and
14 post-transplantation, treated by oral gavage with two
5-day cycles of ART-838 (50 mg/kg/d, n = 8 mice), AS
(200 mg/kg/d, n = 9 mice), or vehicle (control, n = 10 mice)
(Figure 5A). In prior toxicity experiments, these had been
determined to be approximate chronic maximum-tolerated
doses (MTD) for this schedule. The dose-limiting toxicity
was >20% weight loss, and no clinical neurotoxicity was
observed [25]. Normal NSG mice treated with a 5-day
cycle of AS or ART-838 at the above doses had normal
complete and differential blood cell counts on days 6 and
12 (Supplementary Figure S7). In the treatment experiment
shown in Figure 5A, mouse body weights recovered within
1 week after each 5-day treatment cycle (Figure 5B). Most
mice developed palpable tumors by day 14, but in three
ART-838-treated mice, tumors were not palpable until
day 17. Vehicle-treated mice required euthanasia for 2000
mg tumors at day 21, at which time the average mass of
ART-838-treated tumors was 83% less, and that of AStreated tumors 44% less, than the average mass of vehicletreated tumors (Figure 5A). Complete and differential
blood cell counts were within the normal range on day 23,
5 days after the completion of the second treatment cycle
(Supplementary Figure S8).

ART-838 or AS enhanced the in vitro cytotoxicity
of established and emerging antileukemic agents
MOLM14 or KOPN8 cells were treated with each
of three standard antileukemic drugs (cytosine arabinoside
[ARA], doxorubicin [DOX], etoposide [ETO]) or three
kinase inhibitors (midostaurin [MID], lestaurtinib [LES],
sorafenib [SOR]); each of which target multiple kinases,
including FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor (FLT3) [26],
alone and in combination with ART-838 or AS at doses
centered on an equipotency ratio based on the IC50s for
each drug, as recommended for drug combination studies
(Supplementary Table S3) [27]. Addition of ART-838 or AS
enhanced the cytotoxicity of all six tested drugs across a
broad range of concentrations (Supplementary Figures S10
and S11). Based on combination indices (CI) < 1 indicating
synergy and CI = 1 indicating additivity, drug interactions
were typically most favorable at higher drug concentrations.

leukemia cell lines tested. Consistent with multiple reports
that dimeric artemisinin analogs are more cytotoxic toward
cancer cells than their monomeric counterparts [7, 11, 20,
22], ART-838 was far more potent against MOLM14 and
other leukemia cell lines than AS in assays of cell growth,
cell cycling, and apoptosis. Indeed, ART-838 was effective
with IC50<1µM against every acute leukemia tested,
including those harboring poor prognosis mutations such
as MLLr and FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/
ITD) [26, 28].
Iron-activation of the endoperoxide pharmacophore,
resulting in ROS generation, is critical to both the
antimalarial and antineoplastic activities of artemisinins
[6–15]. As previously demonstrated for AS in breast
cancer cells [10], an iron-activation mechanism is
supported by the reported enhanced antineoplastic
activity of AS with the addition of ferrous iron [29–31].
ROS generation by ART-838 or AS was completely
abolished by iron chelation with DFO, and both ART838- and AS-induced apoptosis were partially inhibited

by DFO pretreatment. Absence of the endoperoxide
group from ART-838 abrogated its antileukemic activity.
Our observation that NAC reduced the antileukemic
efficacy of AS but not ART-838 suggests that ART-838
may trigger additional antileukemic mechanisms beyond
ROS induction.
To begin optimizing treatment regimens for future
clinical studies, we assessed the PK, tolerability, and
efficacy of ART-838 and AS in vivo. The single dose
MTDs for AS and ART-838 via oral gavage administration
in NSG mice were ~500-600 mg/kg, and the chronic
MTDs (5 days/week by oral gavage) for ART-838 and AS
were 40-50 mg/kg and 150-200 mg/kg respectively. In PK
studies, AS was rapidly hydrolyzed to its active metabolite
DHA, declining to undetectable levels by 1h, consistent
with its known short T1/2 in humans [23, 24]. ART-838 was
also well absorbed, but was not metabolized to DHA or
ART-606, and had a ~6-fold longer T1/2 than DHA, with
concentrations remaining above the median IC50 for all
23 cell lines for >6h. The superior PKs of ART-838 vs

concentrations, so each was used at its approximate 48h IC50 (concentration that inhibited growth by only 50% at 48h). 16h after addition

AS/DHA may facilitate effective implementation into
antileukemic regimens in the future.
Mice tolerated two 5d cycles of ART-838 (50 mg/
kg/d) or AS (200 mg/kg/d). For both ART-838 and AS,
the dose-limiting toxicity in NSG mice was acute weight
loss, which has not been described in humans receiving AS
[32, 33]. We found that the mice regained weight within
a few days after the last ART-838 or AS dose. Mouse
behavior was normal, and major organs appeared normal
at postmortem. Mouse blood cell counts were not reduced,
in contrast to human clinical results, where AS dose was
limited by transient neutropenia [32]. For this reason
and because transient neutropenia may be acceptable
in leukemia patients, the possibility that humans may
tolerate dose-intensive artemisinin administration should
be carefully examined in Phase I/II studies in leukemia.
Alternative routes of ART-838 and AS administration, e.g.
intermittent or continuous infusion parenteral, could also be
evaluated in preclinical models and/or clinical trials with
accompanying PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies.
We used an sc xenograft tumor-formation model
to begin testing in vivo efficacy of ART-838 and AS. The
MOLM14 cell line was selected because of its sensitivity

to ART-838 and AS in vitro, despite its clinically
unfavorable MLLr and FLT3/ITD mutations. Both
artemisinins significantly delayed sc tumor growth, and
ART-838 was more effective than AS at an approximately
equitoxic dose. To more rigorously assess the in vivo
efficacy of ART-838 and AS, we used an iv primagraft
model that more faithfully recapitulates primary leukemia
growth in humans. Primary B-ALL case #109, harboring
an MLLr mutation, was selected as the first ALL to test
in vivo. Two different treatment regimens were tested in
this iv primagraft model: 1) two 5d cycles of ART-838
(50 mg/kg/d) or AS (200 mg/kg/d), with three weeks offtreatment between cycles, and 2) four 5d cycles of ART838 (40 mg/kg/d) or AS (150 mg/kg/d), with one week
off-treatment between cycles. Both schedules of ART-838
or AS significantly delayed leukemia onset, confirming
results observed using our xenograft model. At these
apporoximately equitoxic doses, ART-838 and AS were
equally effective against this particular primary B-ALL
case. Multiple leukemia cases will need to be tested in
this primagraft model in the future to determine if ART838 has a superior therapeutic window versus AS in vivo.
Together, these experiments demonstrate the ability of

ART-838 or AS to cause substantial in vivo inhibition of
acute leukemias harboring clinically unfavorable FLT3/
ITD or MLLr mutations. Additional cases with different
genotypes will be assessed in the future as we determine if
further optimization of ART-838 and AS regimens enhance
in vivo efficacy.
Although in vitro drug combination experiments in
cell lines may not fully depict drug interactions in patients,
they allow for rational prediction of potentially favorable
drug combinations and avoidance of potential antagonism
[28]. Combination with ART-838 or AS enhanced the
in vitro cytotoxicity of three of the most effective and
widely used standard antileukemic drugs (ARA, DOX,
and ETO), especially at the high drug concentrations
most relevant for clinical cancer treatment [34]. Since

artemisinins, as well as ARA, DOX, and ETO, are known
to increase intracellular ROS levels [35, 36], one potential
mechanism of this drug cooperativity is induction of
oxidative stress. Combination of two ROS-inducers
might elevate intracellular ROS to levels sufficient to
overcome the enhanced endogenous antioxidant capacity
of leukemia cells. Further studies are needed to determine
the mechanisms of cooperativity of each of these drugs
with AS and ART-838, and additional studies should
also be performed to specifically test the hypothesis that
combination with ART-838 or AS might overcome the
development of resistance to antileukemic drugs.
Drugs that overcome resistance to kinase inhibitors
are urgently needed to augment the utility of these targeted
agents against acute leukemias and other cancers [37–39].

FLT3, cKit, PDGFR) [40], LES (targeting FLT3, JAK2,
TrKA/B/C) [41, 42], and SOR (targeting FLT3, VEGFR,
PDGFR, RAF) [43, 44] – in combination with AS or ART838. SOR has been reported to induce dose-dependent
ROS generation in hepatocarcinoma and leukemia cells
[45] via targeting of RAF/MEK/ERK pathways [46] and
inducing ER stress [47]. Thus, ROS generation may be
involved in the additive effects of AS plus SOR. ART-838
combined synergistically with all three kinase inhibitors,
possibly because ROS generation may not be the only
cytotoxic mechanism of ART-838. Differential interactions
of ART-838 versus AS with kinase inhibitors were also
recently reported for anti-cytomegalovirus activity [48].
Indeed, these differences in drug combination interactions
may aid in elucidating novel mechanisms of action of
different artemisinin derivatives.
In summary, ART-838 and AS, members of the
widely used, low-toxicity artemisinin class of antimalarial
drugs, inhibited all tested human acute leukemia cell
lines, representing the three major acute leukemia
subtypes, at low micromolar (AS) or submicromolar
(ART-838) concentrations. Induction of oxidative stress
is an emerging therapeutic strategy for cancers including
leukemias, and the pro-apoptotic activity of both ART838 and AS is at least partially ROS-mediated. PK studies
in mice indicated an extended half-life for ART-838,
as compared to AS. ART-838 and AS inhibited in vivo
growth of a leukemia cell line and a primary human acute
leukemia case. Based on these in vitro and in vivo results,
we believe ART-838 and AS worthy of further preclinical
development as anti-leukemic agents. Although not fully
elucidated, AS targets appear to differ from those of
most current cancer chemotherapeutic agents [49], and
resistance to AS is not conferred by mechanisms affecting
several current antineoplastics [50]. ART-838 might act
via additional mechanism(s) as well. ART-838 and AS
were found to enhance the antileukemic activity of several
established and emerging antileukemic drugs, and further
preclinical drug combination studies appear warranted.
In addition, since the clinical pharmacology and safety
of AS have been established worldwide in malaria
treatment, we suggest a Phase I/II clinical dose escalation
trial of repeated intermittent 5-10d pulses of oral AS in
acute leukemia to find its MTD and further assess PK/PD
parameters in humans with leukemia. The results of such
a clinical trial would open the door to testing in humans
of whether AS enhances clinical efficacy of established
and emerging antileukemic drugs, such as SOR and other
kinase inhibitors, and/or inhibits the development of drug
resistance. If these studies are encouraging, ART-838, with
its higher potency and longer in vivo half-life as compared
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to AS, could be further developed with preclinical
pharmacologic and animal toxicity studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
Synthesis of ART-838, its parent alcohol ART606, deoxy-ART-838, and DHA were described [11,
21, 22]. AS was from LKT Laboratories (St. Paul,
MN); ETO, ARA, DOX, DFO and NAC from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO); LES, MID and z-VAD from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX); and SOR from
LC laboratories (Woburn, MA). ART-838, AS, ETO,
LES, MID, SOR, and z-VAD were stored in DMSO
(Mediatech, Manassas, VA); ARA and DFO in sterile
water; DOX in PBS. All drug stocks were stored at −20°C.
NAC was dissolved in culture medium, pH adjusted to
7.4, and filtered immediately before use. Final DMSO
concentrations were the same for all samples in any given
experiment and always <0.8%.

Cells
MOLM14 human AML cells (harboring MLLr and
FLT3/ITD mutations) were derived from an AML primary
sample and provided by Dr. Feyruz Rassool (University of
Maryland School of Medicine [UMSOM]) [51]. All other
cell lines (Supplementary Table S1) were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) or Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen
(DSMZ). Cell lines were passaged for <6 months after
resuscitation from original cryopreserved stocks. Cell lines
were cultured (37°C, 5% CO2) in RPMI-1640 containing
L-glutamine (Mediatech) and 10% FBS (Gemini Bioproducts, West Sacramento, CA). The primary patient
B-ALL case (harboring MLLr; uniquely designated
B-ALL case #109), was obtained from the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine cell bank under an
Institutional Review Board-approved research protocol).
B-ALL #109 cells were expanded and harvested from
spleens of transplanted immunodeficient NSG mice [52].
Cryopreserved human CD34+ HSPCs from normal
adult donors (Cellular Therapy and Cell Processing Facility,
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA) were thawed
and cultured for 24h in StemSpanSFEM medium (Stemcell
Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) containing 100 ng/
ml recombinant human (rh) stem cell factor, 20 ng/ml rh
thrombopoietin, and 100 ng/ml rh FLT3 ligand (PeproTech,
Rocky Hill, NJ) [53], in the presence of the indicated drug
concentrations prior to plating for clonogenic assays.

Cytotoxicity
In most experiments, cytotoxicity was assessed
using alamarBlue assays (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
7275

Oncotarget

NY). In experiments using NAC and DFO, which can
interfere with alamarBlue assay performance, Trypan Blue
dye exclusion was used instead.

Mice were monitored daily and euthanized when
tumors reached an estimated mass of 2000mg (using
the formula: [length x width2]/2, assuming density =
1 mg/mm3) [56]. For the human leukemia primagraft
model, mice were iv transplanted with primary B-ALL
case #109 cells via lateral tail vein on day 0 before drug
treatment via oral gavage, as detailed in legends. Mice
were euthanized for clinical signs of severe leukemia or
other severe distress [52].

Clonogenicity
Cells pretreated with ART-838, AS, or vehicle
for 24h were diluted and plated in MethoCult medium
(Stemcell Technologies). After 7-10d (leukemia cells) or
10-14d (HSPCs), colonies (≥20 cells) were enumerated
[53].

PKs, CBCs

Cell cycle

Blood samples were collected via retro-orbital
bleeding into EDTA-coated tubes. PK samples were
centrifuged to obtain plasma, which was stored frozen
(−80°C) until liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole
mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) analysis. PK parameters
were calculated from mean drug concentration-time data
using non-compartmental methods as analyzed in Phoenix
WinNonlin version 6.3 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain
View, CA) (see Supplementary Table S4 for details) [57].
CBCs were determined using a Hemavet 950 analyzer
(Drew Scientific, Oxford CT).

Cells were pulse-labeled with 10 µM 5-bromo-2deoxyuridine (BrdU, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for
90min (37°C), washed in PBS, then fixed in 70% ethanol
(1-3d, −20°C). DNA was denatured (2 M HCl, 30min,
room temperature) and neutralized (0.1 M Na2B4O7,
10min, room temperature). Cells were stained with APCconjugated anti-BrdU antibody (BD Pharmingen) and
7-AAD (BioLegend, San Diego, CA), and analyzed by
flow cytometry [54].

Apoptosis

Statistics

Cells were co-stained with 5 ml each 7-AAD and
APC-conjugated Annexin-V (BioLegend), in Annexin-V
binding buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry [55].
Caspase-3/7 activity was measured using a Caspase-Glo
3/7 Assay (Promega, Madison, WI).

Differences between groups were compared using
the Student’s t test. Prism software (Graphpad, La Jolla,
CA) was used for correlation analysis.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

ROS

We thank Ms Kelly Reeder for conducting CBCs on
normal mice after drug treatment.

Cells were preloaded with 5 µM 5-(and-6)chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(CM-H2DCFDA, Life Technologies) in PBS (30min,
37°C), then washed before drug treatment. Following
16h incubation with drugs, cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry.
