BACKGROUND. The purpose of the study was to determine the utility of quantitation of the extracellular domain (ECD) of the HER-2/neu receptor in the serum
for predicting response to treatment in patients with primary breast cancer
receiving neoadjuvant therapy.
METHODS. HER-2/neu ECD was measured in sera obtained from 39 patients with
HER-2-amplified stage II-III primary breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to either 4 cycles of paclitaxel followed
by 4 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) (n ¼ 10) or to
the same chemotherapy with simultaneous weekly trastuzumab for 24 weeks (n ¼
29). Changes in HER-2 ECD were monitored with the Bayer HER-2/neu assay over
6 months and correlated with pathological response to treatment.

ECD concentration was 13.6 ng/mL (mean 6 SD, 20.3 6 35.5 ng/mL). A decrease
Week 6 of chemotherapy was seen regardless of treatment regimen. No signifiwho achieved pathological complete response (pCR) and the group with residual
disease (P ¼ .41). However, a 9% drop from Week 3 to Week 6 after initial chemotherapy was predictive of pCR (P ¼ .04).

CONCLUSION. A decrease in serum HER-2 ECD levels early during treatment was
associated with pathological response in patients receiving primary chemotherapy, particularly trastuzumab-based regimens. Serum HER-2 ECD levels may
serve to monitor neoadjuvant therapy in HER-2-positive primary breast cancer.

T

he human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 oncoprotein
(HER-2) is amplified in 20% to 30% of breast cancers1,2 and
associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and a poor prognosis.3,4 Genomic studies have shown that there are at least 4
distinct molecular classes of breast cancer (luminal, normal-like,
HER-2-positive, and basal-like)5,6 that respond differently to chemotherapy.7 The HER-2 protein is a 185-kDA transmembrane tyrosine
kinase with 3 defined domains: the intracellular tyrosine kinase portion, a short transmembrane portion, and the extracellular domain8
(ECD). This 105-kDa ECD can be cleaved from the surface by metalloproteases9 and detected in the peripheral blood. Elevated levels of
HER-2 ECD are observed in patients with primary breast cancer10,11

or metastatic breast cancer11,12 (MBC). There are presently three Food & Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tests available to quantify HER-2 expression,
including direct testing of DNA amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), protein expression
by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and more recently, serum assays for ECD. Several serum assays have been
proposed for assessment of HER-2 ECD, but only the
Bayer immunoassay (ADVIA Centaur, Bayer Diagnostic,
Tarrytown, NY) has been validated13 and approved by
the FDA.
The increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
in patients with primary breast cancer requires the
appropriate identification of predictive factors of
pathological response to primary chemotherapy, an
important surrogate of survival.14–16 Moreover, the
use of trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, South San
Francisco, CA), a monoclonal antibody targeted against
the extracellular domain of HER-2,17 in combination
with anthracycline- and taxanes-based regimens
was shown to significantly increase pathological complete response (pCR) rates in HER-2 primary breast
cancer.18
Whereas numerous reports have described the
clinical utility of serum HER-2 assays in metastatic
breast cancer, limited investigations have addressed
the predictive value of this test in the neoadjuvant
setting for primary breast cancer.19 The purpose of
this study was 1) to determine the baseline level of
serum HER-2 ECD in a population of patients with
primary breast cancer with HER-2 amplification treated with neoadjuvant therapy; 2) to evaluate the utility of serial testing for predicting pCR to treatment,
in particular in patients treated with trastuzumabbased regimens; and 3) to observe kinetics of changes
of serum HER-2 ECD through chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment
Sera were obtained from 39 patients with lymph
node-positive (stage II-IIIA), HER-2-positive breast
cancer who were enrolled in a prospective randomized trial of primary chemotherapy and treated
between 2002 and 2004 at the University of Texas M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center.18 The Institutional Review Board approved this study and a waiver of informed consent was granted.
Patients were randomized to receive 4 cycles of
paclitaxel at 225 mg/m2 as a 24-hour continuous intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks, followed by 4
cycles of fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 4,
cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 only, and
epirubicin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 only, alone or in com-

bination with trastuzumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg/
week over 30 minutes (after the initial loading dose).
The details of the treatment and study have been
previously reported.18

Serum Collection and HER-2 ECD Testing
Peripheral blood samples were collected before initial
chemotherapy and before each subsequent cycle.
Samples were aliquoted and stored at 808C until use.
Serum HER-2 ECD was measured with the ADVIA
Centaur automated assay (ADVIA Centaur, Bayer Diagnostic). This assay is a sandwich immunoassay using
2 monoclonal antibodies specific for unique epitopes
on the ECD of the HER-2 oncoprotein. The technique
has been previously described.17 The day-to-day precision as defined by the coefficient of variation (CV)
for the ADVIA Centaur automated assay ranged from
5.2% to 6.6% CV for mean values of 14.5 to 92.2
ng/mL. Levels of HER-2 ECD >15 ng/mL are considered abnormal.17
Pathology Assessment
HER-2 receptor status was determined by IHC on tissue sections of preoperative fine-needle biopsies.
The samples were stained using the anti-HER-2
monoclonal antibody AB8 at a 1:100 dilution (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA); tumors with HER-2 IHC
score >1þ (DAKO score) were selected for confirmatory FISH assay. All FISH assays for HER-2 gene
amplification were performed using the PathVision
kit (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL). Tumors with gene
copy ratio of HER-2 gene : chromosome 17 centromere
(CEP17) 2.0 and/or with IHC staining intensity of
3þ were assigned HER-2-positive status.
Response to treatment was evaluated on surgical
specimens at the completion of chemotherapy. Pathologic complete response was defined as no invasive
cancer in the breast or axillary lymph nodes. Residual
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the absence of
invasive cancer was included in the definition of pCR.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were tabulated. The median
ECD levels between patients with or without pCR,
and between the trastuzumab and no trastuzumab
arms, were compared with the Mann-Whitney Utest. Changes in serum HER-2 ECD from baseline
and throughout treatment were compared with the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The correlation between
FISH amplification and serum HER-2 ECD levels was
assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient.
To find the best threshold value of percent
change in HER-2 ECD that would predict pCR, we
considered threshold values of the percent change of

498

CANCER

HER-2 ECD from 0% to –30% in increments of 0.1%.
At each threshold value, we used the Fisher Exact
Test to compare the observed number of patients
with pCR to the predicted number of patients with
pCR using the dichotomized change in HER-2 ECD.
We considered percent change from baseline to
Week 3, baseline to Week 6, and Week 3 to Week 6.
The threshold value that produced the association
with pCR with the highest statistical significance was
selected as the best threshold value for predicting
pCR. A P-value <0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Chicago,
IL) software (v. 12.0) for Windows and S-PLUS 6.1 for
Windows (Insightful, Seattle, WA).

RESULTS
Thirty-nine patients were included in this analysis.
The median age was 52 years; 19 patients (49%) had
estrogen receptor-positive tumors, 13 patients (34%)
had progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer,
and 30 (77%) had estrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive (hormone receptor positive) breast cancer (Table 1). Twenty-nine patients
(74%) were treated with chemotherapy combined
with trastuzumab, whereas the remaining 10 patients
(26%) received the same chemotherapy regimens
without trastuzumab. Twenty-nine (74.4%) patients
had a complete clinical response, 7 (18%) had a partial response, and 3 (7.7%) had no clinical response.
Of the 39 patients, 54% achieved pathological complete response and 46% had residual disease. The
pCR rate was higher in patients treated with trastuzumab-based regimens, 62% versus 30% for chemotherapy alone, respectively (P ¼ .14). The median
follow-up was 32 months. One patient developed a
pleural recurrence (baseline level ¼ 17.2 ng/mL) and
1 patient had lymph nodes recurrence (HER-2 ECD
levels ¼ 14.6 ng/mL).

Levels of Serum HER-2 in the Study Population
Of the 39 nine patients, 11 (28.2%) had an elevated serum HER-2 ECD concentration at baseline: 3 patients
(30%) in the paclitaxel/FEC arm and 8 (27.6%) in the
paclitaxel/FEC with trastuzumab arm. Five (45.5%)
patients were in the pCR group and 6 (54.5%) in the
residual disease group. There was no statistically significant correlation between HER-2 amplification and
baseline serum HER-2 ECD levels (r ¼ 0.193, P
¼ .42). The median baseline level of HER-2 ECD was
13.6 ng/mL (mean 6 SD 20.3 6 35.5 ng/mL).
The median (mean 6 SD) serum HER-2 ECD
level was 13.6 (20.3 6 35.5) ng/mL at baseline, 11
(13.2 6 9.5) ng/mL at Week 3, 11.2 (12.06 6 4.8) ng/mL

at Week 6, and 11.9 (13.3 6 5.9) ng/mL at Week 24.
At Week 24, 7 (17.9%) patients had persistently elevated HER-2 ECD levels, 4 (19%) in the pCR group
and 3 (16.7%) in the residual disease group. Of these
7 patients, 4 had received trastuzumab and 3 were in
the group who received chemotherapy alone.

Correlation of Serum HER-2/neu and Response
to Treatment
A decrease in median HER-2 ECD levels from baseline was observed at Week 3 (P ¼ .005) and Week 6
(P ¼ .025) of treatment in the overall population.
There was no difference in the median baseline
serum of HER-2 between pCR and residual disease
groups (13.9 [mean 6 SD 15.5 6 7.9] ng/mL vs 13.6
[mean 6 SD 25.9 6 51.8] ng/mL, P ¼ .41).

For the 21 patients with pCR, a significant decrease
in median HER-2 ECD levels was observed at Week 3
(P ¼ .001) and Week 6 (P ¼ .003) compared with baseline levels (respectively, 10.8 [mean 6 SD 15.5 6 7.9]
ng/mL and 10.9 [mean 6 SD 11.7 6 2.8] ng/mL, compared with 13.6 [mean 6 SD 11.1 6 3.1] ng/mL for
baseline) (Fig. 1). However this change in median HER2/neu levels (but with lower magnitude) was also
observed in the 18 patients with residual disease both
at Week 3 (P ¼ .007) and at Week 6 (P ¼.01) (Fig. 2).
When considering the percent change in HER-2
ECD from baseline to Week 3, the threshold value
that best predicted pCR was a 15% decrease (P
¼ .19). From baseline to Week 6 the best threshold
value for predicting pCR was a 9% decrease (P ¼ .09),
and from Week 3 to Week 6 the best threshold value
for predicting pCR was a 9% decrease (P ¼ .04).

ng/mL vs 13.4 [mean 6 SD 36 6 69.2] ng/mL, P ¼.80).
However, a significant decrease in median HER-2
ECD levels in the trastuzumab group at Week 3 (10.9
[mean 6 SD 11.6 6 2.7] ng/mL; P < .001) and Week 6
(10.6 [mean 6 SD 11.3 6 3.1] ng/mL; P ¼ .003) compared with baseline (13.7 [mean 6 SD 14.9 6 6.9]
ng/mL) was observed (Fig. 3). In the group that did
not receive trastuzumab, there was a less significant
drop at Week 3 (P ¼ .04) but similar at Week 6 (P
¼ .002) (Fig. 4). Thus, serum HER-2 ECD levels appeared to be slightly better serological markers for
trastuzumab-based therapies.

Evolution of Serum HER-2 Levels and Type of Regimen
There was no difference in baseline levels of HER2ECD between the trastuzumab and chemotherapy

DISCUSSION
Pathological complete response to induction chemotherapy is considered an important prognostic factor
for patients with primary breast cancer undergoing
induction chemotherapy.14–16 The use of sensitive
imaging modalities, eg, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) demonstrated that patients that achieve early

response have higher likelihood of obtaining pCR.
The recent introduction of molecular target therapies
highlight the need to identify early predictors of
pathological response to treatment.20,21 The assessment of tissue HER-2 expression is usually limited,
as it only reflects the condition at initial diagnosis
and does not provide information on the evolution
of the disease in response to therapy. Hence, the
measure of serum HER-2 ECD appears less invasive
than FISH or IHC evaluation and more appropriate
to characterize the dynamics of tumor behavior during systemic treatment, as reported in metastatic disease.22–24 In our study we observed that serum HER2 ECD levels varied during chemotherapy, regardless
of the type of response and the regimens utilized,
but the variation was more significant for trastuzumab-based regimens. Moreover, the drop in HER-2
ECD levels during the earlier weeks after initiation of
therapy appeared to be more accurate than baseline
HER2 levels to predict pCR.
Previous authors have shown that elevated levels
of circulating HER-2 ECD reflected the tumor burden
in primary breast cancer, independent of tumor stage.25 The 28.2% incidence of elevated serum HER-2
ECD in our series is concordant with the 18.1% (0%–
38%) rate in primary breast cancer reported in the
recent review by Carney et al.26 The correlation between HER-2 expression determined by IHC and circulating HER-2 ECD has been variously reported.22–24
Thus, Kostler et al.23 observed in 55 MBC significantly higher median baseline HER-2 ECD values in
grade 3þ tumors than in grade 2þ tumors (53.4 ng/
mL vs 12.1 ng/mL, respectively, P ¼ .002). These
results are concordant with those of Muller et al.,24
who observed a significant correlation between baseline HER-2 ECD levels and IHC overexpression (r ¼
0.39, P ¼ .018), with a median ECD concentration of
45.2 ng/mL in tumors with strong HER-2 overexpression. With regard to the small number of patients
with 2þ IHC score in our series, we did not find a
correlation (r ¼ 0.193, P ¼ .42) between the 2 techniques for HER-2 evaluation.
The use of serum HER-2 ECD has been associated with prognostic value in MBC.24 Furthermore,
a <20% decrease in serum HER-2 ECD has shown to
predict the benefit of trastuzumab-based therapies in
metastatic disease.25 Moreover, it has been suggested
that the decrease in HER-2 ECD levels was related to
the therapeutic response of the HER-2/neu portion
of the tumor that release ECD in the circulation
rather than the type of chemotherapy.26 Elevated
levels of CA27-29 or other MUC-1-based markers has
been associated with tumor load in breast cancer
and predictive value in metastatic disease, particularly

with a 25% increase or >50% decrease of the baseline values recommended for determination of either
progression or response to treatment.27 Those comparisons with the analyses conducted in MBC using
HER-2 ECD or other serum markers clearly indicate
that tumor burden and benefit from treatment are
associated with a determined percentage of decrease
from baseline value (different for each markers).
The utility of serum HER-2 ECD quantification
has been shown for patients with MBC, but its usefulness to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in primary breast cancer is less well established. Our study, comparable with other reports in primary breast cancer, indicated levels of serum HER-2
ECD lower than those usually reported for advanced
disease. Therefore, it is possible that serum HER-2
levels are related to tumor load as well as the proportion of HER-2/neu receptors shed in the blood.24
Higher levels have been reported in more aggressive
disease, for instance, in patients with visceral metastases and in patients with early recurrence of disease.28,29 Furthermore, in accordance with previous
findings in metastatic disease,23,24,27 the baseline
level of HER-2 ECD was not a predictor of response
to treatment and the mean baseline values were not
different between the pCR group and the group with
residual disease in our series. A subsequent small
study involving only 16 patients tested the value of
serum HER-2 ECD in neoadjuvant treatment; the
authors did not find a difference in pathological
response rates between patients with elevated (15
ng/mL) or normal baseline ECD levels.23 In fact, the
variation in HER-2 ECD levels in the earlier weeks after initiation of chemotherapy should be a better indicator for response as reported in metastatic
studies.22–25 Interestingly, we demonstrated that a 9%
drop in HER-2 ECD levels from Week 3 to Week 6
was better to predict response to therapy (P ¼ .04)
than changes in HER-2 levels from baseline. These
data support the findings of Kostler et al.19 in a series
of 55 patients with MBC treated with a trastuzumabbased regimen that noted that each 10% decrease of
ECD from baseline was associated with a high odds
ratio of response and benefit to chemotherapy. Moreover, the study of Kostler et al. was the only published report that evaluated the utility of circulating
HER-2 ECD in the neoadjuvant setting; the authors
reported a significant decrease after 8 and 22 days of
primary polychemotherapy and trastuzumab in the
group with histopathologic response; they reported
lower ECD levels relative to baseline throughout
treatment for the pCR group compared with the
group with residual disease (117.3 ng/mL vs 55.1 ng/
mL, respectively, P ¼ .01, at 8 days).

Conclusion
In summary, we found in our study that baseline serum level of HER-2 ECD was not a predictive marker
of pathological response to treatment in the neoadjuvant setting for primary breast cancer. However, the
early decrease in HER-2 levels a few weeks after initiation of chemotherapy were more relevant than
baseline ECD levels to discriminate pathological response to therapy, particularly when using trastuzumab-containing regimens. Further larger prospective
studies will need to address the predictive value of
HER-2 ECD levels in comparison with standard clinical and imaging assessments.
