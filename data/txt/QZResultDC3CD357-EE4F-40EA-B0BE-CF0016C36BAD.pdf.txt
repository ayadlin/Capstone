Abstract
Androgen receptor (AR) plays a pivotal role in prostate cancer,
primarily by regulating different gene expression programs
elicited by androgen, which is important for cancer cell
proliferation, survival, and differentiation. It is believed
that the transcriptional function of AR is mediated largely
by distinct nuclear coregulators. We report here the identification of ANCCA (also known as ATAD2), a new member of
the AAA+ ATPase family proteins, as a novel AR coactivator.
ANCCA interacts directly with AR and enhances its transcriptional activity, and is required for androgen-stimulated
expression of a specific subgroup of genes including IGF1R,
IRS-2, SGK1, and survivin. Upon androgen stimulation, ANCCA
together with AR is recruited to the specific AR target
genes. Suppression of ANCCA expression strongly inhibited
the proliferation of androgen-responsive or androgenindependent, AR-positive prostate cancer cells and caused a
significant increase of cellular apoptosis. Strikingly, the
ANCCA gene itself, located at chromosome 8q24, is highly
induced by androgen in androgen-dependent prostate cancer
cells and xenograft tumors. Although ANCCA is hardly
detected in normal human prostate tissue, high levels of
ANCCA are found in hormone-independent prostate cancer
cell lines, xenograft tumor, and a subset of prostate cancers
with high Gleason scores. Together, these findings suggest that
ANCCA plays an important role in prostate cancer by
mediating specific AR functions in cancer cell survival and
proliferation. The possession of ATPase and bromodomain by
ANCCA makes it an attractive target for the development of
therapeutics for the disease. [Cancer Res 2009;69(8):3339–46]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently occurring
malignancies in aging men worldwide. It requires androgen and/
or androgen receptor (AR)–mediated signaling for its development
and progression as androgen ablation therapy and/or AR
antagonist are effective in the initial treatment of the disease. In
prostate cancer, the aberrant function of AR is likely the primary
driving force of the initial androgen-dependent tumor growth and

the later progression to androgen deprivation–independent or
hormone refractory status. However, how AR function evolves from
largely prodifferentiation in the normal, adult prostate to
protumorigenesis in the malignant tissue is still poorly understood
(1, 2). Intensive studies aimed at understanding prostate cancer
progression from androgen-dependent to hormone refractory
status has led to the proposition of multiple mechanisms to
explain how AR is facilitated to override the need of physiologic
levels of androgen for its activation. They include increased
expression of AR protein, mutations in AR that broaden its
hormone response spectrum, abnormal signaling by growth factors
and/or their receptors that activates AR, and the aberrant function
of AR-interacting proteins, particularly the coactivators (3, 4).
Despite such progress, the pressing issue that remains is how the
function of AR evolves to aberrantly promote the expression of
genes that are critical for prostate cancer development and
progression.
The primary functional mode of AR, a member of the nuclear
hormone receptor superfamily, is believed to regulate gene
transcription (5). Like other transcription factors, AR-mediated
transcriptional activation or repression requires many coregulators
(6), which were identified by virtue of their interaction with AR and
coactivating AR on the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene
promoter. Among them, a few have been strongly implicated in
prostate cancer with evidence of being important for AR-mediated
control of prostate cancer cell proliferation and/or survival, tumor
growth, and aberrant expression in tumors (7–15). For example,
members of the SRC/p160 nuclear receptor coactivator family were
found overexpressed in subgroups of prostate cancer tumors, and
their elevated levels correlate with disease recurrence and prostate
cancer cell proliferation and survival (7, 12, 16). Genetic
inactivation of SRC-3 expression in a mouse prostate cancer model
strongly prevented the progression of prostate tumorigenesis to
more aggressive forms (17). Further studies suggest that overexpressed SRCs such as SRC3 may promote androgen deprivation–
independent prostate cancer cell proliferation by stimulating the
expression of genes critical for cell proliferation and survival
(18, 19). Interestingly, overexpressed p300, histone acetylases which
can directly or indirectly interact with AR, may regulate nuclear
matrix protein expression and promote prostate cancer aggressiveness (20). Recently, histone demethylases such as LSD1 and
JMJD2C were found to coactivate AR and were aberrantly
expressed in prostate cancer, further underscoring the role of
AR-interacting proteins, particularly the chromatin coregulators, in
prostate cancer progression (11, 21).
Here, we report our identification of ANCCA, a member of the
AAA+ ATPase family of proteins (22), as a novel AR coactivator.
ANCCA is overexpressed in prostate tumors and is critical for
prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival. Strikingly, ANCCA is

highly induced by androgen and controls the expression of specific
AR target genes such as insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R),
insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), and serum and glucocorticoid–
induced protein kinase-1 (SGK1), but not PSA. Together, our data
suggest that androgen-dependent, aberrant AR signaling in
prostate cancer involves de novo synthesis of specific coregulators
such as ANCCA to mediate the tumorigenic gene expression
program of AR, and that androgen-independent, elevated expression and/or function of these coregulators, as observed for ANCCA,
may represent an important mechanism of prostate cancer
progression to androgen deprivation–independent or hormone
refractory status.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, transfection, infection, gene expression, cell
proliferation, and apoptosis assays. A detailed description of the cell
culture and assays can be found in the Supplementary Data. Briefly, cells
were transfected or infected with synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA)
targeting ANCCA (5¶-GCTACTGTTTACTATCAGGCT-3¶ in human ANCCA/
ATAD2 cDNA) or control sequences, later treated with androgen, and then
harvested at the indicated times for RNA and protein analysis or apoptosis
and cell proliferation assay.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed essentially as described previously
(23, 24). The primers used for amplification of PSA gene fragments were
described by Louie and colleagues (23), and the primers used for
amplification of SGK-1 gene enhancer were described by Shanmugam and

colleagues (25). For IRS-2 gene amplification, the primers used were
5¶-AGCTCTGTGACTGCCTCCTGCTGT-3¶ and 5¶-GATGCTCCTCCGATGCTCCAACGG-3¶, which were designed based on the AR-binding
region identified (26).
Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. LNCaP cells were
stimulated with 1 nmol/L of DHT for 24 h and then harvested for
preparation of nuclear extracts as described previously (24). The nuclear
extracts were diluted to contain 150 mmol/L of NaCl, 20 mmol/L of Hepes
(pH 7.9), 0.2 mmol/L of EDTA, 0.5% NP40, and 1 mmol/L of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). Equal
amounts of nuclear extracts were incubated with the antibodies with or
without 1 nmol/L of R1881 for 2 h at 4jC, followed by incubation with
protein A beads (Zymed) for 1 h. After extensive washing, the
immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western analysis with anti-AR
antibody (NeoMarker). In vitro–translated ANCCA proteins were incubated
with anti-flag M2 antibody bead-bound with purified, flag-tagged AR
protein (f100 ng) in the presence of 1 nmol/L of R1881 at 4jC for 1 h in the
binding buffer described previously (24). The beads were then washed four
times with the binding buffer containing 300 mmol/L of KCl and subjected
to SDS-PAGE. ANCCA proteins retained on the beads were visualized by
autoradiography.
Immunohistochemistry. Tissue sections from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue blocks or arrays were dewaxed, rehydrated, and blocked
for endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen retrieving was performed with
a microwave oven in 0.01 mol/L of sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0).
Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubating in 10% normal
horse serum for 30 min. Affinity-purified, anti-ANCCA antibody was added
at 1:300 ( for CWR22 xenograft tumors) or 1:100 ( for normal or tumor
human prostate tissues) dilutions, and incubated for 30 min. The sections

analysis. D, sections of CWR22 xenograft
tumors isolated from an intact mouse
implanted with a testosterone pellet or from a

Androgen-Induced Coregulator ANCCA in Prostate Cancer

Figure 2. Suppression of ANCCA expression inhibits the proliferation and survival of androgen-dependent and hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells. Cells
were plated in hormone-deprived medium for 24 h before being infected with adeno-RNAi-ANCCA (Ri-A ) or adeno-RNAi-GFP (Ri-G ) control, or mock-infected
(for LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 in A and B ), or transfected with synthetic RNAi (for C4-2B in B and LNCaP in C ). Twenty-four hours after the treatments, cells were
stimulated with 0.1 nmol/L of R1881 (LNCaP ) or changed to fresh hormone-deprived medium. Cells were harvested on different days after infection for Western or
proliferation (A and B) or for detection of apoptosis (C ). For apoptosis, RNAi-treated LNCaP cells were incubated with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide and
quantified for apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. Cells were also harvested 72 h after transfection for detection of cleaved PARP (85 kDa) by Western analysis.

were then washed and incubated with biotin-conjugated secondary
antibodies for 30 min, followed by incubation with avidin DH-biotinylated
horseradish peroxidase complex for 30 min (Vectastain ABC Elite Kit,
Vector Laboratories). The sections were developed with the diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) and counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma). The specificity of the ANCCA antibody was determined using
LNCaP cell cultures and CWR22 tumors harvested with and without
androgen stimulation. CWR22 xenografts were generated as described
previously (19). Human tumor blocks were collected from the Department
of Pathology of Zhujiang Hospital in accordance with the hospital’s
Institutional Review Board on Biomedical Specimen standards. Tissue
microarray slides were obtained from U.S. Biomax, Inc. Tumors were
evaluated and graded by pathologists according to guidelines (27). The
tissue section immunoreactivity to ANCCA antibody was scored negative
if <1% of prostate epithelial cells displayed any staining, and scored positive
if >5% of the cells displayed staining with moderate to high intensity.
Differences in the immunostaining among groups were analyzed with the
m2 test.

Results
ANCCA is strongly induced upon androgen stimulation or
highly elevated independent of androgen. In our attempt to
identify genes that may play critical roles in androgen induction of
prostate cancer cell proliferation, we compared three sets of
microarray data generated from LNCaP cells, one treated by DHT,
one ectopically expressing the nuclear hormone receptor coactivator/proto-oncogene ACTR, and one ectopically expressing the
kinase-dead mutant of MAK, a serine/threonine kinase that can act
as a coactivator of AR (28). We found that an ORF named PRO2000

www.aacrjournals.org

(also known as ATAD2), with no functions reported at the time
of the analysis, is one of a small group of genes (data not shown)
with expression induced by DHT, up-regulated by ACTR, and
down-regulated by the kinase-dead mutant MAK, which suppresses
LNCaP proliferation (28). Given its predicted domain structures
(AAA+ ATPase and bromodomain) and its functional association
with AR and cancer (described below),4 we thus named it ANCCA,
for AAA+ nuclear coactivator cancer–associated.
To determine the expression kinetics of ANCCA induced by
androgen in prostate cancer cells, we treated LNCaP cells with
DHT or synthetic androgen R1881 for different time periods and
harvested cells for ANCCA mRNA and protein analysis. As shown
in Fig. 1A, ANCCA protein (f170 kDa) was barely detected in the
absence of androgen. Remarkably, 24 hours of androgen treatment
resulted in a >10-fold induction in ANCCA mRNA and protein, and
its androgen induction can be observed as early as 3 hours after
androgen treatment, similar to that of PSA (Fig. 1A). Interestingly,
androgen induction of ANCCA can be detected earlier than many
androgen-induced genes that play critical roles in cancer cell
proliferation and survival including SGK1, IRS2, IGF1R , and some of
the cell cycle/E2F target genes examined. We next extended our
analysis to PC346C, an androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell
line with wild-type AR (29), and found that ANCCA is also
highly induced by androgen (Fig. 1A, bottom). Next, we examined
ANCCA expression in androgen deprivation–independent prostate

cancer cells and tumor xenografts. Compared with androgeninduced ANCCA in LNCaP, high levels of ANCCA protein were
detected in LNCaP-derived C4-2B and CWR22 xenograft–derived
CWR22Rv1 cells both in the absence and presence of DHT (Fig. 1B),
indicating that ANCCA expression in these androgen deprivation–
independent cells is largely independent of androgen. Similar
results were obtained from other hormone-refractory prostate
cancer cells such as LNCaP-cds, LNCaP-p53-R273H (30, 31), and
AR-negative PC-3 cells (data not shown).
To examine whether androgen induction of ANCCA is mediated
by AR, LNCaP cells were treated with DHT in the absence
or presence of antiandrogen bicalutamide (Casodex). Results in
Fig. 1C clearly show that androgen-induced ANCCA expression
in LNCaP can be effectively blocked by the antiandrogen (top).
To directly show the involvement of AR, we also knocked down
AR expression in LNCaP cells and found that suppression of
AR significantly impeded androgen-induction of ANCCA (Fig. 1C,
bottom). The growth of CWR22 xenograft tumor in nude mice
is androgen-dependent (32). Immunohistochemical analysis

Androgen-Induced Coregulator ANCCA in Prostate Cancer

ANCCA is required for proliferation and survival of
androgen-dependent and hormone-refractory prostate cancer
cells. Given its remarkable induction by androgen, we began to
examine the potential role of ANCCA in the control of prostate
cancer cell proliferation and survival. LNCaP cells were infected
with recombinant adenoviruses that express short hairpin RNA
specifically targeting ANCCA, and then treated these cells with
androgen. As shown in Fig. 2A, ANCCA-specific RNAi inhibits the
expression of ANCCA but not AR. However, suppression of ANCCA
induction dramatically inhibited androgen-stimulated LNCaP cell
proliferation. Similar inhibitory effects of ANCCA knockdown
were observed in LNCaP cells grown in the absence of androgen

Figure 5. ANCCA coactivates AR-mediated transcription. A, PC-3 cells were
transfected with the indicated constructs, stimulated with 1 nmol/L DHT or vehicle
for 24 h, and then harvested for the h-gal and luciferase assays. B, LNCaP cells
stimulated with 1 nmol/L of DHT or vehicle for 12 h were harvested for ChIP
assays with indicated antibodies. The eluted DNA fragments were amplified with
primers encompassing the ARE sequences in the promoter or enhancer region
of SGK-1, IRS2 , or KLK3/PSA genes. The locations of the regions amplified
relative to the gene loci are indicated by a short line on the gene locus diagrams.

pellet removed, ANCCA expression was dramatically reduced.
Together, these results indicate that ANCCA is a novel nuclear
protein that is strongly induced by androgen through AR in
AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines and tumors, and is highly
elevated when prostate cancer cells become androgen-independent
or hormone-refractory.

(Supplementary Fig. S1) in C4-2B and in CWR22Rv1 cells (Fig. 2B), or
by transfection of siRNA sequence targeting a different region
of ANCCA (data not shown). Interestingly, the growth curve of
ANCCA-suppressed cells turned downward after a few days of
ANCCA suppression, suggesting that ANCCA expression is required
for cancer cell survival. To determine whether ANCCA depletion
resulted in the activation of apoptosis, we stained the cells with
FITC-conjugated Annexin V (green) together with propidium iodide
(red) and quantified apoptotic cells (positive for Annexin V and
negative for propidium iodide) by flow cytometry (Fig. 2C;
Supplementary Fig. S2). Remarkably, >43% of cells were apoptotic
3 days after transfection with synthetic siRNA targeting ANCCA. To
ascertain that components of the apoptosis pathway are indeed
activated, using Western analysis, we examined the appearance of
cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a marker for apoptosis. Indeed, the cleaved PARP was readily detected in cells
transfected with ANCCA siRNA but not in control siRNA-treated
cells (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, depletion of ANCCA in AR-negative PC-3
cells did not significantly affect their proliferation (data not shown).
Together, these data suggest that high levels of ANCCA are required
for the proliferation and survival of AR-positive prostate cancers.
ANCCA is specifically required for the expression of
androgen-induced genes that control cancer cell proliferation
and survival. Having found that ANCCA is critical for prostate
cancer cell proliferation and survival, we began to address its
functional mechanism. Given its role as a transcriptional coregulator, as revealed in our recent study (24), we examined the effect of
silencing ANCCA on androgen-induced expression of genes with
demonstrated function in the control of cancer cell proliferation and
survival. Among them are IGF1R, IRS-2, SGK1, survivin, E2F1, cyclin
A2, and cyclin D3 (18, 19, 25, 33–39). As shown in Fig. 3A, LNCaP cells
transfected with ANCCA siRNA and treated with androgen showed a
3-fold to 4-fold reduction in the transcript levels of these genes when
compared with cells transfected with control siRNA. Similar
inhibitory effects on their protein levels were obtained by Western
analysis (Fig. 3B, left). Intriguingly, ANCCA suppression did not seem
to have any detectable negative effect on androgen-induced KLK3/
PSA (Fig. 4A) and KLK2 expression (data not shown). In AR-positive
but androgen-independent CWR22Rv1 cells, a similar effect of
ANCCA suppression on cell proliferation and the survival of genes
was observed (Fig. 3B, right). Together, these data suggest that high
levels of ANCCA are required for the expression of an androgendependent and potentially AR-regulated subset of genes critical for
cancer cell proliferation and survival.
ANCCA via its NH2 terminus directly associates with AR at
the DBD and hinge region. We next examined whether the
function of ANCCA in the control of androgen-AR target genes is
due to its ability to directly interact with AR. Thus, we first
performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay. LNCaP cells were
treated with androgen to induce the expression of ANCCA. Nuclear
extracts were then immunoprecipitated with ANCCA antibody in
the presence or absence of androgen. Remarkably, in the presence of
androgen, a significant proportion (>10% of input) of AR was
coprecipitated by anti-ANCCA antibody, indicating that endogenous ANCCA and AR are strongly associated and that the
association is largely androgen-dependent (Fig. 4A). To identify
the potential domain of ANCCA which mediates the interaction,
we performed pull-down experiments in the presence of androgen,
using purified, flag-tagged, recombinant AR and in vitro–translated,
S35-methionine–labeled ANCCA-truncated forms. Results in Fig. 4B
indicate that ANCCA interacts specifically with AR primarily

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (8). April 15, 2009

through the NH2 terminus of ANCCA, with amino acids 284 to
293 being one of the critical regions. To localize the interface of AR
that mediates the interaction with ANCCA, we performed GST
pull-down assays with GST-AR fusions containing different domains
of the receptor and full-length ANCCA protein. Results in Fig. 4C
show that ANCCA interacts primarily with the DBD-hinge region of
AR as fragments containing NTD (1–565) and LBD (676–848) do not
show any interaction, but fragments containing DBD and hinge
(505–676 or 635–919) showed strong binding. Similar results were
obtained when the in vitro pull-down experiments were performed
in the absence of hormone (data not shown).
ANCCA coactivates AR-mediated transcription. To determine
whether ANCCA acts as a transcriptional coactivator for AR, we
performed a reporter gene assay using synthetic ARE-driven
luciferase construct in PC-3 cells which lack endogenous AR
expression. As expected, expression of AR activated the reporter
f4-fold in the presence of androgen (Fig. 5A). Expression of ANCCA
alone, however, has no significant effect on the reporter. Remarkably,
coexpression of ANCCA and AR resulted in >10-fold activation of the
reporter, strongly suggesting that ANCCA coactivates AR-mediated
transcription. To extend our analysis to the potential, natural targets
of ANCCA, we performed ChIP assay with LNCaP cells stimulated by
androgen. As reported previously (23, 25, 26, 40, 41), androgenstimulated AR recruitment to the AR-binding regions of IRS-2 (f9 kb
downstream of IRS-2 gene), SGK1 (f3 kb upstream of its
transcription start site), and PSA genes (Fig. 5B). Analysis of antiANCCA ChIP DNA revealed that androgen also strongly stimulated
ANCCA recruitment to the same AR-binding regions of SGK1 and
IRS2 but not PSA, consistent with our finding that ANCCA is required
for androgen induction of SGK1 and IRS-2 but not PSA. Taken
together with the data that ANCCA directly interacts with AR, these
findings indicate that ANCCA is a novel AR coactivator and functions
by selectively mediating the expression of a subset of AR target genes.
ANCCA is overexpressed in tumors of the prostate cancer
and its overexpression correlates with disease progression.
Given the critical role of ANCCA in prostate cancer cell proliferation
and survival, we surmised that ANCCA protein might be aberrantly
expressed in human prostate cancers. We thus examined ANCCA
expression in surgical specimens of human prostate by immunohistochemistry. Eighty-five tumor tissues and nine normal tissues
were analyzed. In all of the normal prostate tissue sections
examined, virtually no staining was seen in the epithelial cells
(Fig. 6; Supplementary Table S1). A relatively low ANCCA
immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm of some of the
basal cells and occasionally in the nucleus (Fig. 6A, arrow). In
contrast, among 85 tumors examined, positive ANCCA immunoreactivity was observed in 28 tumors (33%). When the results were
grouped according to Gleason score, 51% of specimens with
Gleason scores of 7 to 10 were positive for ANCCA, whereas 14% or
19% of tumors with Gleason scores of 1 to 3 or 4 to 6, respectively,
were positive (Supplementary Table S1). These data suggest that
ANCCA is overexpressed in a subset of human prostate cancers and
that its overexpression seems to correlate significantly (P = 0.0032)
with disease progression. The results also warrant future investigation with large cohorts of samples with clinical data for potential
prognostic value of ANCCA overexpression.

Discussion
In our study on the key factors involved in AR signaling in
prostate cancer cell proliferation, we identified ANCCA as a highly

androgen-responsive gene and showed that its androgen induction
plays a critical role in prostate cancer cell proliferation and
survival. Suppression of ANCCA expression resulted in strong
inhibition of androgen-stimulated as well as hormone-independent
prostate cancer cell proliferation. We also found that ANCCA is
overexpressed in a significant proportion of prostate cancer tumors
and that its overexpression correlates with high tumor grades.
Interestingly, high levels of ANCCA are not required for ARnegative prostate cancer cell proliferation (data not shown),
suggesting that the function of ANCCA in prostate cancer cells is
AR-dependent. Together, these results suggest that ANCCA plays an
important role in prostate cancer progression.
AR controls the expression of genes with diverse functions
ranging from cell differentiation, survival, proliferation, and
metabolism. Whether specific coregulators are involved in
mediating AR control of specific target genes has not been clearly
addressed. In this study, we found that ANCCA does not seem to
play a significant role in androgen induction of a group of genes
such as KLK2 and KLK3/PSA that are expressed in normal adult
prostate but elevated in prostate tumors. Instead, we found that
ANCCA is crucial for androgen-stimulated expression of SGK1, IRS2, IGF1R , and survivin. Further ChIP analyses showed that ANCCA
and AR are recruited to the AR-binding regions in an androgendependent manner, indicating that they are direct targets of
ANCCA. Given the fact that ANCCA-AR target genes such as
IRS-2, survivin, and SGK1 are well-known for their function in
promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival, it is attempting to
speculate that coregulators such as ANCCA might be involved in
the integration of a specific gene expression program among the
functionally diverse gene targets of AR, suggesting a functional
mode that is different from that of many other coactivators such as
the p160/SRCs.
One salient feature of ANCCA is its robust induction of
expression by androgen in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells,
which suggests a feed-forward mechanism of ANCCA function in
mediating androgen signaling. From the perspective of AR
function, such a feature of ANCCA, combined with its selective
involvement in specific AR target gene programs, argues for a
notion that androgen-dependent, aberrant AR signaling in prostate
cancer may entail the induction of specific coregulators to mediate
the specific tumorigenic gene expression program of AR. Although
the majority of the AR coregulators identified thus far may not be
subject to androgen regulation in their expression, recently, a few
coregulators including p300/CBP, Tip60, TIF2, and FHL2, as well as
the serine/threonine kinase MAK which might regulate ANCCA
expression (28), have been found to be regulated by androgen.
FHL2 was shown to be induced by androgens through the
activation of serum response factor (42). Interestingly, the other
coregulators are negatively controlled by androgens as androgen
withdrawal resulted in their elevated expression and androgen
exposure led to their decreased expression (7, 9, 43). Therefore, due
to such dynamic control of the coregulator expression in androgensensitive prostate cancer cells, it is quite possible that androgen

stimulation and withdrawal triggers a reshuffle of AR coregulator
complexes at specific AR target genes. Further study of the
dynamics of coregulator expression, and their complex assembly
and function at distinct AR target genes, will be of importance to
our understanding of AR function in hormone-sensitive tumors as
well as the mechanism of androgen-deprivation refractory state.
Several AR coregulators possess or recruit chromatin-modifying
or chromatin-remodeling activities, underscoring changing chromatin structure and/or function as one of the crucial mechanisms
of AR-mediated control of gene transcription. Interestingly, like
Brg1 or Brm, the ATPase component of the human SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling complexes, ANCCA possesses an ATPase
domain and a bromodomain (24), suggesting that ANCCA has the
potential to remodel the chromatin structure. Alternatively,
ANCCA may play a role in the dynamic assembly or disassembly
of protein complexes at the regulatory region of AR targets. Such a
function is fully in line with the well-established biochemical
activities of AAA+ proteins, which are evolutionarily conserved
proteins harnessing energy from ATP hydrolysis to alter the
conformation of their substrate proteins. For instance, eukaryotic
DNA replication involves a large number of ATPase proteins with
many of them being AAA+ proteins including ORCs, Cdc6, MCMs,
and the clamp loader RFCs (44). We recently showed that ANCCA
possesses ATPase activity and that it is required for estrogeninduced recruitment of CBP to specific ER target genes (24),
therefore supporting the idea that one of the mechanisms of
ANCCA function is to facilitate the loading/assembly of coregulator
complexes at the chromatin target. We also found that the
bromodomain of ANCCA recognizes specific histone modification
marks and is critical for ANCCA to serve as a coactivator.5 Future
studies will be needed to better understand the role of ANCCA in
the dynamics of AR coregulator complexes and in mediating
specific AR target gene programs that are critical for prostate
tumorigenesis, and to examine the potential of ANCCA as a
therapeutic target for prostate cancer intervention.
