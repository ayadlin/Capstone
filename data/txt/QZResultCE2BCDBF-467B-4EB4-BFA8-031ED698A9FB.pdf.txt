BACKGROUND: Tumor angiogenesis has been associated with a poor prognosis in patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). Microtubule stabilizers and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors, alone and in combination, have produced inhibitory effects on endothelial cells and tumor angiogenesis. Angiogenesis, which is the growth of new blood
vessels, is necessary for tumor growth and progression. Thus, the authors tested the safety and efficacy of a low
dose of paclitaxel and celecoxib in patients with MM. METHODS: Patients received paclitaxel 10 mg/m2 for 96 hours
weekly as a continuous intravenous infusion and oral celecoxib 400 mg twice daily. Systemic tumor response was
assessed at 6-week intervals. Tumor measurements at the end of Cycle 1 were used as the baseline for assessment of
tumor progression. Patients with unacceptable toxicity or disease progression after Cycle 2 relative to the end of
Cycle 1 were taken off study. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled. Twelve of 20 patients (60%) had received 2
previous systemic therapies. Three patients did not receive treatment because of rapid disease progression. Treatment-related grade 3/4 toxicities were limited to catheter-related complications. One patient achieved a partial
response, and 3 of 20 patients (15%) had stable disease for >6 months. The median time to progression was 57 days
(95% confidence interval, 43-151 days), and the median overall survival was 212 days (95% confidence interval, 147-811
days). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose, continuous intravenous infusion paclitaxel and oral celecoxib produced disease stabilization in a significant proportion of heavily pretreated patients with MM. These findings support a role for metroC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Malignant melanoma is the ninth most common cause of cancer in the United States. Its incidence, however, is rising faster than any other malignancy, especially among younger individuals.1 Metastatic melanoma is relatively unresponsive to chemotherapy and frequently is treated with biologic response modifiers, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and
interferon.2 Unfortunately, long-term responses are uncommon, and the median survival for patients with advanced disease ranges between 6 months and 12 months.3-5 The therapeutic options for patients whose disease has progressed after
IL-2-based immunotherapy and/or dacarbazine-based cytotoxic chemotherapy are limited and investigational. The association of tumor angiogenesis with a poor prognosis6 has encouraged the study of antiangiogenic therapy in patients with
malignant melanoma.
Microtubule stablizers and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors, alone and in combination, reportedly have produced inhibitory effects on tumor angiogenesis and growth.7,8 Low doses of paclitaxel were observed accumulating preferentially in endothelial cells and inhibited angiogenesis in vitro.7 In addition, plasma from patients who received

‘‘metronomic’’ therapy exhibited antiangiogenic activity
in vitro.7 Moreover, a growing body of evidence indicates
that COX-2 plays a significant role in tumor progression
in malignant melanoma.8 The contributions of COX-2 in
tumor growth and angiogenesis include increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by
tumors cells and production of the eicosanoid products
thromboxane A2, PGE2, and PG12, which can directly
stimulate endothelial cell (EC) migration and growth factor-induced angiogenesis.8
Low-dose, continuous dosing of chemotherapeutic
agents has been referred to as ‘‘metronomic scheduling.’’
In this approach, there are no rest periods off therapy, and
the use of lower doses minimizes toxic side effects. Metronomic therapy reportedly represents a promising antitumor strategy.9,10 A major focus of recent clinical trials has
been the inclusion of correlative studies to aid in the scientific understanding of the intervention. Prior studies of
angiogenic biomarkers have suggested that metronomic
therapy is associated with changes in thrombospondin.11
Moreover, circulating ECs (CECs) and circulating endothelial progenitors (CEPs) also exhibited changes over the
course of therapy that may be correlated with clinical benefit.12,13 In the current study, we combined COX-2 inhibition with paclitaxel at metronomic doses to determine
its effect on patients with refractory, metastatic melanoma. We also assessed correlative biomarkers in an effort
to understand the mechanism of action of this combination of agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed melanoma
with radiographic evidence of metastatic disease and clinically documented disease progression. Patients may have
received multiple prior systemic treatments. Inclusion criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status 2, a life expectancy 3 months, and
adequate organ function. Exclusion criteria included a
history of myocardial infarction, angina, or conduction
abnormalities within 3 months and the concurrent use of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heparin, or warfarin. Patients must not have received prior treatment with
low-dose paclitaxel chemotherapy, either weekly or daily;
patients who had received paclitaxel every 3 weeks at
standard doses were eligible. There were no other limitations on previous therapy. Other exclusion criteria
included untreated brain metastasis, prosthetic devices,

1752

and active/recurrent infections. A washout period of 4
weeks was required after any radiotherapy or chemotherapy before the initiation of study treatment.
All patients provided written informed consent. The
study was approved by the institutional review board at
the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in accordance
with international standards of good clinical practice.
Procedures and Treatment
Patients received paclitaxel 10 mg/m2 for 96 hours weekly
as a continuous intravenous infusion and oral celecoxib
400 mg twice daily. This dose of paclitaxel produces a
blood level similar to the concentration of paclitaxel that
reportedly had antiangiogenic activity when combined
with celecoxib. This was determined previously, because
plasma from 4 patients who received these doses exhibited
inhibitory effects on cultured ECs.7
Paclitaxel was initiated 1 week before celecoxib to
assess the tolerability and biologic effects of paclitaxel
alone. A cycle lasted for 6 weeks, and systemic tumor
response was assessed at the end of each cycle. At baseline and at the beginning of each cycle, patients underwent a history and physical examination, assessment of
performance status, blood tests for a complete blood
count, liver function tests, serum chemistries (including
lactate dehydrogenase), and blood and peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC) counts for correlative studies.
Chest, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomography
(CT) scans were obtained every 6 weeks. Treatment was
continued until patients developed progressive disease
or until there was evidence of unacceptable toxicity.
Patients without clinically symptomatic disease progression at 6 weeks could continue on therapy for another 6
weeks with the 6-week CT scan serving as the new baseline imaging study.
After enrollment of 10 patients, 2 patients developed
central line-related Staphylococcus aureus infections. Thus,
the protocol was amended to screen for S. aureus in the nares of patients to determine whether they were carriers of
this organism. Cultures from the nares were obtained at
the beginning of the study and every 3 months thereafter.
Patients who screened positive were treated with intranasal
mupirocin. In addition, standard nursing guidelines were
implemented to ensure consistent catheter care.
Clinical Endpoints
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the
safety and activity of paclitaxel and celecoxib administered
at a particular dose and schedule in this patient

population. Assessment of adverse events and toxicities
was performed every 2 weeks during the first 6 weeks of
therapy, every 3 weeks thereafter while patients were
receiving treatment, and 4 weeks after paclitaxel and celecoxib were discontinued. A 25% dose reduction of paclitaxel (from 10 mg/m2 to 7.5 mg/m2 was permitted if the
higher dose level was associated with significant toxicity in
a given patient. Activity was measured by clinical parameters and by CT tumor measurements. Response rates on
CT scans were evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Response was
evaluated at the end of Cycles 1 and 2 and every other
cycle thereafter.
Because we assumed that this treatment regimen
would be cytostatic, not cytotoxic, and that patients could
experience an initial period of tumor growth before stabilization, disease progression documented on the initial
6-week scan was considered a true lack of treatment efficacy
only if it was accompanied by new symptoms. Thus,
patients who had some radiographic evidence of disease
progression at Week 6 but then had stable disease at Week
12 (relative to Week 6) were considered for continued participation on study. For patients who continued on therapy, the Week-6 scan represented the new baseline for
subsequent response characterization. The time to progression (TTP) was calculated as the time from registration to
the time of disease progression (clinical or radiographic, as
assessed by RECIST criteria) or to the time of progression
after the new baseline was established at Week 6 in patients
who had early disease growth. Overall survival was defined
as the time from registration to death. Survival was censored at the date patients were last known alive.
Correlative Studies
Blood collection

Blood specimens for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and to evaluate antiangiogenic biomarkers were obtained at baseline, during the first week of
single-agent paclitaxel, during the first week of combined
paclitaxel and celecoxib, every 2 weeks on Cycle 1, and 3
weeks thereafter on combined paclitaxel and celecoxib.
Plasma cytokine analyses

Plasma cytokine levels (IL-8, angiogpoietin-2,
thrombospondin-1, VEGF, soluble VEGF receptor 2
[sVEGFR2], and fibroblast growth factor) were measured
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) at baseline, during Cycle 1,

and monthly during therapy until patients had evidence
of disease progression.
Flow cytometry

CECs were counted by using 4-color flow cytometry
analysis as previously described.12 PBMCs were collected
from patients at study entry, during the first week into
paclitaxel infusion, every 2 weeks for the first cycle, and
every 3 weeks thereafter in CPT citrate tubes (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and were spun to separate
the monocyte layer. The PBMCs were frozen in media
consisting of 50% RPMI, 40% human plasma, and 10%
dimethyl sulfoxide, and stored in liquid nitrogen until the
day of analysis. Samples were analyzed in batches to minimize interassay variability. Briefly, the cells were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline that contained 1% albumin and were incubated with a panel of 4 antibodies,
including CD45, CD31, CD146, and CD133,12 along
with the appropriate isotype controls. Mature CECs were
defined as negative for the hematopoietic marker CD45,
positive for endothelial markers CD31 and CD146, and
negative for the progenitor marker CD133. CEPs had the
same phenotype but were positive for CD133. Human
umbilical vein ECs (Cambrex Corporation, East Rutherford, NJ) were used as a positive control for CD146 staining, and WERI cells (American Type Culture Collection,
Manassas, Va) were used as a positive control for CD133.
Statistical Analysis
All patients who were enrolled in the study, including
those who progressed before the start of treatment, were
considered evaluable. The median TTP and survival were
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and approximate confidence limits were calculated using the Greenwood formula. Individual data and within-patient
changes that were observed at baseline and on Day 29 are
presented. Within-patient changes were compared using a
t test for paired data, and overall changes were compared
using a Student t test. In the biomarker analyses, no corrections for multiple testing were performed.
Sample Size
The sample size, 20 patients, was selected based on practical considerations. With 20 patients, we would have 95%
power to detect a serious adverse event that occurred in
14% of patients We also would have a confidence interval width of approximately 9% to 49% for an observed
rate of 25% with stable disease for 6 months, which was

considered sufficient accuracy for preliminary data on
safety and efficacy.

RESULTS
This trial was activated in September 2001 and was closed
to accrual in October 2005 after target accrual was
reached.
Characteristics of Patients and Treatment
In total, 20 patients were accrued. Of these, 3 patients
developed rapid disease progression before initiating treatment and were never treated. Table 1 summarizes baseline
patient characteristics of the enrolled patients: Thirty percent of patients had received >3 prior systemic treatments, and 55% of patients had >4 sites of disease. Fifty

1754

percent of patients had cutaneous primary melanomas,
and 50% had choroidal, mucosal, or unknown primary
tumors. The median total number of weeks on treatment
was 6 weeks (range, 3-92 weeks). Fourteen of 17 treated
patients terminated treatment because of progressive disease, and the remaining 3 patients terminated treatment
because of toxicity.
Activity and Survival
In an intention-to-treat analysis, 3 of 20 patients (15%)
experienced disease stabilization for >6 months (95%
confidence interval [CI], 3%-38%). These 3 patients had
a TTP of 24 weeks, 60 weeks, and 92 weeks. In addition,
4 patients had a TTP >12 weeks with a specific TTP of
13 weeks in 1 patient, 17 weeks in 1 patient, and 18 weeks
in 2 patients (Fig. 1). No RECIST-defined complete
responses were observed, but 1 patient had a partial
response. The median TTP was 57 days (95% CI, 43-151
days), and the median overall survival was 212 days (95%
CI, 147-811 days) (Fig. 2). Five patients survived for >1
year, including 1 patient who remained alive at 40
months.
Toxicity
Treatment was tolerated well in this patient population,
and most toxicities were caused by central line-related
complications (Table 2). These included 2 patients who
developed bacteremia/sepsis and 3 patients who developed deep venous thrombosis, 2 of whom also developed
pulmonary embolism. Because of the episodes of central
line-related S. aureus infection, the protocol was amended
to screen for S. aureus in the nares of patients, and the

identified carriers received intranasal mupirocin. Subsequent to this intervention, there were no additional episodes of central line-related infectious complications.
Toxicities related to paclitaxel and celecoxib were limited
to 1 patient with grade 3 anemia and 1 patient with grade
3 hypertension.
Plasma and Circulating Endothelial
Cell Analysis
Nine of 17 treated patients underwent CEC/CEP analyses. We also measured serial levels of circulating plasma
cytokines. Although there were trends toward increases in
the numbers of CEPs among patients who received therapy for >12 weeks, the numbers of samples obtained were
not large enough to assign significance to this trend. There
was no correlation of levels of sVEGFR2, IL-8, angiopoietin 2, fibroblast growth factor, VEGF, or thrombospondin 1 with therapy or clinical benefit.

DISCUSSION
There is a need for new, effective therapies for patients
with metastatic melanoma. Metronomic chemotherapy is
a promising strategy for inhibiting angiogenesis and is
associated with lower toxicities than conventional chemotherapy dosing regimens. The current study was designed
to study the effect of celecoxib and low-dose, continuous
intravenous paclitaxel in patients with metastatic melanoma. The treatment regimen was well tolerated, and
most toxicities were related to the central venous catheter
that was needed to administer the paclitaxel. Although the
median progression-free survival for this cohort was short,
Cancer

April 1, 2010

evidence of potential antitumor activity was observed, and
stable disease was maintained for >6 months in 15% of
patients. In particular, 2 patients who remained on the
study for >1 year (60 weeks and 92 weeks) exhibited prolonged disease stabilization. One of these patients
achieved a RECIST-defined partial response with 38%
shrinkage of target lesions, and the other patient had 12%
shrinkage of target lesions over the treatment course.
The mechanism underlying this activity is uncertain.
Although the effects would be consistent with antiangiogenic activity, we cannot formally rule out the possibility
that the prolonged use of paclitaxel even at the low doses
used may have produced direct tumoricidal effects. Moreover, it is conceivable that paclitaxel and celecoxib may
have influenced the immune response to the tumor in
these patients; because, like COX-2 inhibitors, metronomic therapy with cyclophosphamide can decrease
T-regulatory cells.14
CECs and CEPs reportedly were elevated in
patients who had several malignancies. Moreover, in a
study by Shaked et al, therapy with vascular-disrupting
agents led to the acute mobilization of CEPs, which
could be blocked by VEGFR2 inhibition.15 It also has
been reported that VEGF administration increases both
mature CECs and CEPs, and this was increase was
reversed with a VEGFR2 inhibitor. Only a portion of
the patients on the current study had correlative biomarker studies. With such small sample numbers, we did
not observe significant changes; however, in the future,
larger studies could examine whether there is an increase
in CEPs among patients who receive clinical benefit
from therapy during treatment, consistent with an effect
of therapy on blood vessels. Theoretically, changes in
CEPs also could be a result of treatment with paclitaxel,
as described in another recent article by Shaked et al.16
Overall, in patient plasma, there were few robust biomarker changes that could serve as predictive biomarkers
of effectiveness. Whether this was because plasma did
not reflect tumor changes, or because of the minimal

1755

Original Article

efficacy of treatment, or because of limited sampling
remains uncertain. The utility of CEP levels as predictive
of stable disease requires prospective validation in future
studies.
Since this study was initiated, COX-2 inhibitors
have been tested in metronomic dosing in 2 recent trials.
In a study of pioglitazone and refecoxib before trofosfamide treatment in patients with advanced melanoma, 4 of
22 patients received clinical benefit, as defined as disease
stabilization and tumor responses.17 In addition, in a
study of low-dose, metronomic treosulfan and rofecoxib,
4 of 12 patients achieved disease stabilization.18
Consistent with those results and our current findings, it has been demonstrated recently that antiangiogenic therapies benefit patients with melanoma.
Bevacizumab has been evaluated in combination with
paclitaxel and carboplatin as well as with weekly paclitaxel,
and these combinations produced high rates of disease stabilization.19,20 In addition, the VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase
inhibitors have demonstrated promise in the treatment of
melanoma.21 It was reported recently that axitinib had
single-agent activity in stage IV melanoma.22 Our study
supports the use of antiangiogenic strategies as a potentially promising therapy for patients with metastatic
melanoma.
