ABSTRACT
We have created a novel fluorescent model of a human ovarian carcinoma
xenograft overexpressing receptor HER2, a promising molecular target of solid tumors.
The model is based on a newly generated SKOV-kat cell line stably expressing far-red
fluorescent protein Katushka. Katushka is most suitable for the in vivo imaging due
to an optimal combination of high brightness and emission in the “window of tissue
transparency”. The relevance of the fluorescent model for the in vivo monitoring of
tumor growth and response to treatment was demonstrated using a newly created
HER2-targeted recombinant immunotoxin based on the 4D5scFv antibody and a
fragment of the Pseudomonas exotoxin A.

of targeted anticancer agents from therapeutic monoclonal
antibodies to sophisticated stimuli-controlled particlesbased theranostics agents [6]. Evaluation of the therapeutic
effects of the newly engineered targeted agents requires
the development of adequate tumor models expressing
appropriate targets.
The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
(HER2) is a well-known diagnostic marker and advanced
molecular target for a targeted therapy of cancer [7].
This receptor is overexpressed in a range of tumor types
including but not limited to breast, ovarian, endometrial,
colon, prostate, cervical, and non-small-cell lung cancer.
HER2 is implicated in disease initiation and progression,
is associated with poor prognosis and may predict the
response to chemotherapy and hormonal therapy [8]. The
development of suitable models that allow visualization
and quantification of antineoplastic efficacy of HER2targeted agents in vivo is necessary to carry out preclinical
evaluations. Recently, a HER2-expressing mouse breast
cancer cell line 4T1 transfected with GFP has been used
for intraoperative imaging of metastatic lymph nodes [9].
In this study we created a novel fluorescent xenograft
model characterized by the HER2 overexpression
and emission in the far-red region of the spectrum. We
demonstrated the relevance of the fluorescent model for

INTRODUCTION
Xenograft models of human cancer are
indispensable tools for evaluation of efficacy of novel antitumor therapeutic agents. With the development of the
fluorescent protein technology, experimental fluorescent
tumor models have become widespread [1], allowing
easy and inexpensive detection and quantification of a
tumor using optical fluorescence imaging. As compared
with MRI, PET, and SPECT, this method is rapid, has a
high throughput, does not require contrasting agents or
expensive imaging equipment [2, 3], and provides a noninvasive, highly specific, and high-resolution monitoring
of tumor growth and metastasis in an individual animal
in vivo over a prolonged period of time. Moreover,
fluorescent tumor models make it possible to take into
account only tumor cells without stromal cells, connectivetissue capsule and vessels of host nature [4]. This renders
the assessment of therapeutic effects of anti-tumor agents
more accurate and reproducible than commonly applied
vernier caliper measurements, especially in the case of
small or deeply laying tumors [5].
Owing to the considerable progress in molecular
oncology, a variety of tumor molecular targets has become
known to date. This led to implementation of a new class

the ETA fragment was added [12]. A synthetic cluster of
six His residues at the C-terminus facilitated purification
of the protein via Ni2+ affinity chromatography. A 3D
model of the mature 4D5scFv-ETA immunotoxin molecule
is shown in Fig. 4B.
The resulting fusion protein 4D5scFv-ETA was
produced in E. coli and purified as described in Materials
and Methods. The obtained protein was of the expected
molecular weight and homogeneity according to SDSPAGE (Fig. S2).
To make sure that binding affinity of 4D5scFv was
conserved in the fused protein, dissociation constants
(Kd) of the 4D5scFv-ETA immunotoxin were determined
on immobilized recombinant protein p185HER2-ECD by
surface plasmon resonance with the BIAcore analyzer.
The fused 4D5scFv showed binding characteristics
comparable in specificity and affinity to those of the
parental antibody; Kd of 4D5scFv-ETA (~6.8 nM) was
similar to that of 4D5scFv (Kd ~5.2 nM) (Fig. S3). These
results are in agreement with previously published data on
affinity values for 4D5scFv determined on cells by RIA
(Kd ~3nM) [13]. Thus, 4D5scFv located on N-terminus
of the designed immunotoxin 4D5scFv-ETA retains
its specificity and high affinity typical for the parental
antibody.
The cytotoxic effect of 4D5scFv-ETA was tested
on a number of cell lines with different levels of the
HER2 expression: cell lines SKOV-3 and SKOV-kat
overexpressing HER2 [14]; HeLa cells with relatively low
level of the HER2 expression [15], and HER2-negative
CHO cells [16]. Besides, the effects of free 4D5scFv
and ETA were evaluated separately to verify the efficacy
of 4D5scFv-ETA as a fuse of targeting and cytotoxic
modules.
4D5scFv-ETA was highly cytotoxic against the
HER2-positive cell lines, and the effect correlated with
the expression level of HER2 (Fig. 5). Cytotoxic effect of
the immunotoxin on the HER2-negative CHO cells was
much less pronounced. To estimate the specificity of the
immunotoxin due to its targeting module we calculated
the targeting index for each cell line tested (IC50 ETA/
IC50 4D5scFv-ETA). For HeLa cells with low level of the
HER2 expression IC50 of free ETA was about 15 times
higher than that of 4D5scFv-ETA. For SKOV-3 cells and
their derivative SKOV-kat cells used in continued in vivo
study, the targeting index reached the values of about 388
and 612, respectively (Table 1).
No cytotoxic effect of 4D5scFv was revealed in any
cell culture tested (Fig. S4).

RESULTS
Generation and characterization of fluorescent
cell line overexpressing HER2 and subsequent
xenograft tumor model
Human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line SKOV-3
was used as parental for generation of a novel fluorescent
cell line overexpressing HER2. The SKOV-3 cell line was
stably transfected with the fluorescent protein Katushka
gene. To improve their fluorescence properties, the
transfected cells were sorted three times following multiple
expansions and the cells with the highest expression of the
fluorescent protein were collected for further expansion.
By repeating the sorts, the mean fluorescence level was
increased up to 20–30 times of the fluorescence of the
original transfectants (Fig. 1). The obtained cell line was
named SKOV-kat (Fig. 2).
SKOV-kat cells implanted subcutaneously in
the subscapular area of BALB/c nude mice formed
a fluorescing tumor with high cellularity and thin
interlayers of connective tissue; ICH revealed HER2
overexpression (+++) in the tumor tissue (Fig. 3).
Fluorescence signal from cancer cells was easily detected
in vivo by epifluorescence imaging immediately after the
injection and then during the tumor development. Strong
correlation of tumor volume calculated on vernier caliper
measurements and integral fluorescence of tumor (Fig. S1)
made it possible to quantify tumor progression and the
response to treatment by whole-body imaging.

Immunotoxin construction, purification
and characterization
The scFv fragment of the monoclonal antibody
4D5 containing light (VL) and heavy (VH) chain variable
domains was fused to a truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin
A (a.a. 252–613, herein referred to as ETA) representing
translocation domain II, domain Ib and domain III
which catalyzes the ADP ribosylation and inactivation
of eucaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2), thus arresting
the protein synthesis and leading to cell death. It has been
previously shown that natural N-terminus of 4D5scFv is
important for proper antibody function [10]. Therefore,
the nucleotide sequence of hybrid gene encoding ETA
fragment was placed at the C-terminus of the 4D5scFv
encoding sequence (Fig. 4A). The targeting (4D5scFv)
and cytotoxic (ETA) moieties were connected via a
16-amino-acid flexible linker derived from the mouse
IgG3 hinge region [11] that prevents spatial interference
between the two domains. To increase the cytotoxic
potency of the toxin, KDEL sequence at the C-terminus of

chemotherapy drug cisplatin or their combination.
Single injection of 4D5scFv-ETA resulted in a
suppression of the tumor growth with the tumor growth
inhibition coefficient of about 80% (Fig. 7, red bars).
The combined treatment of tumors by 4D5scFv-ETA and
cisplatin slightly enhanced the anti-tumor effect (Fig. 7,
green bars). In this group the tumor growth inhibition
coefficient reached 85%. Although a single administration
of the immunotoxin-either alone or in combination with
chemotherapy-had a pronounced anti-tumor effect, it was
not sufficient for total elimination of tumor cells.

growth. On the other hand, a tremendous evolution of
targeted therapy of cancer demands a variety of tumor
models expressing different molecular targets.
HER2 receptor is among the first successfully
approved targets for solid tumors treatment. HER2specific therapeutic antibodies (Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab)
as well as antibody conjugate (Ado-Trastuzumab
Emtansine) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Lapatinib) are
now commercially available on the market. Huge number
of potential HER2-targeted drugs are under clinical or
preclinical studies.
In this study, we have created the first fluorescent
xenograft model of the human tumor overexpressing
HER2 receptor. The model can improve the efficiency
of work on the creation of targeted drugs as well as its
informativity due to possibility to non-invasively monitor
the formation of regional and distant metastases.
The fluorescent protein Katushka used for
generation of cell line SKOV-kat belongs to a family
of far-red fluorescent proteins that are well-suited for
the in vivo imaging as their emission spectrum falls
within the “window of tissue transparency” [17].
A  number of cancer cell lines expressing red or farred fluorescent proteins providing the largest depths of
fluorescence signal detection have been developed over

DISCUSSION
Estimation of anti-tumor potential in vivo is an
essential part of preclinical study of novel therapeutic
agents, so development of appropriate animal tumor
models has become a fast-growing field of experimental
oncology. In recent decades opportunities of in vivo tumor
visualization have been greatly expanded by means of
fluorescent protein technology and optical fluorescence
imaging methods that in combination provide long-term
and highly sensitive whole-body monitoring of tumor

the past  decade, among which are colorectal, pancreas
and epidermoid carcinomas, breast adenocarcinoma,
Lewis lung carcinoma, etc. [4, 18–20]. The brightness of
Katushka is seven- to tenfold higher than that of spectrally
close protein HcRed or mPlum; besides, Katushka is
characterized by fast maturation, as well as a high pH
stability and photostability [21]. Comparison with other
red and far-red fluorescent proteins demonstrated that
Katushka features optimal combination of high brightness
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and far-red fluorescence and is therefore most favorable
for visualization within living tissues [21, 22]. Feasibility
of Katushka for in vivo visualization of the tumor response
to treatment has been shown by Pardo and co-authors [18]
as well as Rask and co-authors [19].
For the first proof of principle, the created model
was used for in vivo evaluation of anti-tumor efficacy

fragment of Trastuzumab (4D5scFv) as a targeting module
and fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA) as a
toxic module. Immunotoxins composed of functionally
independent toxic and targeting modules are now believed
to represent state-of-the-art therapeutic agents for the
HER2-targeted therapy. We have previously designed
several HER2-targeted immunotoxins with different
mechanisms of action based on 4D5scFv: immunoRNAse
[23] and immunophotosensitizers [24, 25]. It was shown
that 4D5scFv is an extremely effective targeting module
for HER2-targeted delivery.
In vitro experiments proved that 4D5scFvETA at picomolar concentrations eliminated HER2overexpressing cells, including SKOV-3. Cytotoxicity of
4D5scFv-ETA significantly exceeded that of Trastuzumab
[26] and was comparable with the cytotoxicity of other
ETA-based anti-HER2 immunotoxins presented by
other  authors [27–29]. It should be noted that cell line
SKOV-3 is known to be highly resistant to Trastuzumab
and to many other cytotoxic drugs [30]. ETA used in this
study negligibly decreased the viability of SKOV-3 cells.
Combination of ETA with targeting anti-HER2 module
greatly enhanced the cytotoxic efficacy of ETA with
respect to these cells. The value of IC50 for 4D5scFv-ETA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was almost two orders of magnitude lower than the value
of IC50 for ETA. This effect was yet more pronounced
for  the Katushka-transfected SKOV-3-derived cells
(SKOV-kat).
In vivo tumor growth monitoring on the SKOVkat xenograft tumor model revealed a high therapeutic
potential of tested anti-tumor agents with the tumor growth
inhibition coefficient of about 80% for the immunotoxin
and 85% for combined therapy with the immunotoxin
and cisplatin. One possible approach to further enhance
therapeutic efficacy of the immunotoxin is multiple-dose
administration but it is limited by the immunogenicity
of recombinant proteins based on bacterial toxins. These
immunotoxins can induce the formation of neutralizing
antibodies hindering the efficacy of immunotoxins [31].
Recently an approach for minimization of immunogenicity
of ETA-based immunotoxins via elimination of B-cell and
T-cell epitopes has been suggested [32, 33].
In conclusion, we have created the first fluorescent
model of human HER2-overexpressing ovarian cancer.
Due to far-red emission this model can be easily
visualized and quantified by fluorescence imaging
methods and should be highly advantageous for screening
and preclinical study of different HER2-targeted drugs

Stained cells and xenograft tumor tissues were
imaged using an inverted laser scanning confocal
fluorescence microscope Axiovert 200M LSM 510 META
NLO (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The images were obtained
with a 100× oil immersion objective with a numerical
aperture of 1.4. Fluorescence of TurboFP635 protein was
excited by the HeNe laser at 543 nm and collected in the
range of 597–661 nm. To visualize Hoechst 33258 stained
nuclei, Ti:Sapphire femtosecond tunable laser was used
for two-photon excitation at 720 nm, and emission was
collected in the range of 390–465 nm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of a fluorescent tumor cell line
overexpressing HER2
The human ovarian adenocarcinoma SKOV-3
cell line was cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (HyClone)
and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were grown in the
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C.
To obtain a fluorescent tumor cell line, SKOV-3
cells overexpressing HER2 were transfected with
mammalian expression vector pTurboFP635-N
(Evrogen) encoding the far-red fluorescent protein
Katushka (commercial name TurboFP635) using
Unifectin-56 transfection reagent (Unifectin Group)
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Cells were
selected in the medium containing 500 μg/ml of G418
(Sigma), and stably transfected cells were sterile sorted
on a FACSVantage DiVa cell sorter (BD Biosciences,
USA) equipped with a yellow 561 nm laser to excite
TurboFP635. Cells were sorted, expanded in cell culture
and sorted again to obtain the brightest fluorescent
protein subset, with three sort/expansions cycles. The
obtained cell line named SKOV-kat was maintained in
the same way as parental cells SKOV-3.

Construction, expression and purification of
immunotoxin 4D5scFv-ETA
The plasmid for expression of fusion protein
4D5scFv-ETA was constructed on the basis of the pSD4D5-barnase plasmid [10]. Genetically engeneered
manipulations, cell culturing, and cell lysis were
performed according to standard protocols. The DNA
fragment encoding ETA protein was amplified from
plasmid pIG6-4D5MOCB-ETA [34] using primers
5′-actacGGCGCGCCGGAGTTCCCGAAACCGTCCAC
and 5′-tgcgtAAGCTTCTACAGTTCGTCTTTATGGTG.
The product of amplification was cloned into pSD-4D5barnase plasmid instead of barnase gene using AscI and
HindIII restriction endonucleases. The resulting construct
pSD-4D5scFv-ETA was verified by sequencing.
For production of 4D5scFv-ETA containing His6-tag
on C-terminus, the Escherichia coli expression strain BL21
was transformed with pSD-4D5scFv-ETA and grown in
lysogeny broth (LB) at 28°C. Expression of 4D5scFv-ETA
was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG at OD550 of 0.8.
The bacteria were then incubated at 28°C for 12 h. The cells
were harvested, centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended
in the lysis buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, 40 mM K2HPO4, pH
8.3, with 0.5 M NaCl) and sonicated on ice. The lysate was
then centrifuged at 22000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The pellet
was used for purification of His6-tagged protein on Ni2+-NTA
column (GE Healthcare) under the conditions recommended
by the manufacturer. The protein was eluted with 250 mM
imidazole. For final purification of 4D5scFv-ETA, elution
fractions were diluted 20-fold, applied onto Q Sepharose
FF 1-ml column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using linear
gradient from 25 to 500 mM NaCl.
The SDS/PAGE analysis of the proteins was
performed according to standard protocols using 12.5%
polyacrylamide gels.

Xenograft tumor model
Six- to eight-week-old immunocompromised
female nude mice (20–23 g) were purchased from the SPF
(specified pathogen-free) licensed nursery of Shemyakin
& Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the
Russian Academy of Sciences. Animals were kept in
well-ventilated polypropylene cages with a 12-h lightdark cycle, fed with sterilized standard laboratory food
and supplied with water ad libitum. All experimental
procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Institute.
SKOV-kat cells grown in culture flasks were
carefully detached using PBS (pH 7.4) with 5 mM EDTA,
centrifuged, and resuspended in sterile PBS to a final
concentration of 4 × 107 cells/ml. Then the cell suspension
was mixed with basement membrane-like matrix Matrigel
(BD Biosciences, USA) at a ratio of 1:1 and the mixture
was inoculated subcutaneously in the subscapular
region (0.1 ml per mouse). The HER2 expression in the
developing tumors was analyzed by HercepTest (Dako)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To confirm
the TurboFP635 expression in the tumor xenografts,
confocal microscopy of the excised non-fixed tissues was
performed.

pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Tween-20).

system (Institute of Applied Physics RAS, Russia) [36].
Fluorescence was excited by LED at a wavelength of
585 nm; for the emission collection, band-pass filter
628–672 nm was used. All fluorescence images were
acquired with an exposure time of 2 s.
Fluorescence images were analyzed using ImageJ
software (National Institute of Health, USA). The
averaged signal was calculated in two regions of interest
(ROI): tumor area and a region of the same area sited
symmetrically relative to the animal spine (background).
The resulting integral fluorescence signal was calculated
as a difference between the fluorescence of the tumor and
the background fluorescence. Data are presented as mean
±SEM. Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way
ANOVA (one-way analysis of variance) and Dunnett’s
test (Primer of Biostatistics 4.03 software). The difference
between compared values was considered statistically
significant at p < 0.05.
To evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic agents under
study, coefficient of tumor growth inhibition (TGI%)
was calculated according to the following formula:
TGI% = [(Flcontrol – Flexperiment) × 100%]/Flcontrol, where Fl
is an integral fluorescence intensity in the tumor area at a
selected time point.

Cell treatment and cell viability assay
Cells SKOV-3, SKOV-kat, CHO (Chinese hamster
ovary), and HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) were
cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium (for SKOV-3 and SKOVkat) or RPMI-1640 (for HeLa and CHO) with 10% (v/v)
fetal calf serum (HyClone) and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells
were grown in 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Cytotoxicity of 4D5scFv-ETA was estimated using
MTT assay [35]. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates
at a density of 4 × 103 (SKOV-3, SKOV-kat, and HeLa) or
6 × 103 (CHO) cells per well and were allowed to attach
overnight. The medium was removed, and the cells were
then incubated in the presence of 4D5scFv-ETA at different
concentrations or with a control protein (free ETA or free
4D5scFv) in growth medium at 37°C for 72 h in 5% CO2.
Then the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated
with serum-free medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT for 1 h.
Formazan formed from the reduction of MTT was dissolved
in DMSO, and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm with
Synergy MX plate reader (BioTeck, USA). The amount of
formazan produced is assumed to be proportional to the
number of living cells. Cell viability was expressed as a ratio
of the optical density of treated and untreated cells given
in percents. Experiments were performed in triplicate and
repeated at least two times. Data analysis and calculation of
IC50 was performed using the GraphPad Prism 6 software.
