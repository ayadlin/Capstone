Transcriptional Activation by pRB and Its Coordination
with SWI/SNF Recruitment
Stephen Flowers1, George R. Beck, Jr.2, and Elizabeth Moran1

Abstract
A central question in cancer biology is why most tumor susceptibility genes are linked with only limited types
of cancer. Human germ-line mutation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene Rb1 is closely linked with just
retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma, although the gene is universally expressed. Functional analysis of pRB and its
close relatives, p107 and p130, has largely focused on their roles in repression of proliferation across all tissue
types, but genetic evidence indicates an active requirement for pRB in osteoblast differentiation that correlates
more directly with osteosarcoma susceptibility. Still, potential promoter targets of pRB and its role in normally
differentiating osteoblasts remain insufficiently characterized. Here, an early marker of osteoblast differentiation,
alkaline phosphatase, is identified as a direct promoter activation target of pRB. One role of pRB on this promoter
is to displace the histone lysine demethylase KDM5A, thereby favoring trimethylation of H3K4, a promoter
activation mark. A major new aspect of pRB-mediated transcriptional activation revealed in this promoter analysis is its role in recruitment of an activating SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. SWI/SNF is a critical
coordinator of tissue-specific gene expression. In osteoblasts, SWI/SNF complexes containing the BRM ATPase
repress osteoblast-specific genes to maintain the precursor state, whereas the alternative ATPase BRG1 distinguishes an activating SWI/SNF complex necessary for RNA polymerase-II recruitment. A switch from BRM to
BRG1 on the alkaline phosphatase promoter marks the onset of differentiation and is accomplished in a precise
two-step mechanism. Dissociation of BRM-containing SWI/SNF depends on p300, and association of BRG1containing SWI/SNF depends on pRB. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8282–7. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Human germ-line mutation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene Rb1 is closely linked with only two types of cancer: retinoblastoma in early childhood and osteosarcoma in
adolescence (1), although the gene is universally expressed.
The nature of the links between individual susceptibility
genes and specific forms of cancer is a central question in
cancer biology. Functional analysis of pRB and its close relatives, p107 and p130, has largely focused on their roles in
repression of proliferation across all tissue types (2, 3), but
genetic evidence indicates an active requirement for pRB in
osteoblast differentiation that correlates more directly with
osteosarcoma susceptibility (4–7). Thomas et al. (5) showed
pRB in direct association with the activated promoters of the
late-stage osteoblast markers osteocalcin and osteopontin,
finding that pRB physically associates with and augments
the activity of RUNX2 (alias CBFA1), a critical transcriptional

regulator of osteoblast differentiation. More recently, pRB
was shown to bridge interactions between RUNX2 and activating cofactors on the osteocalcin promoter (8, 9). pRB has
also been shown to displace a target protein, KDM5A (aliases
RBP2 and JARID1A), from the osteocalcin promoter to relieve
repression and permit replacement by pRB and associated
transactivators (10). Other osteoblast-specific promoter targets of pRB remain essentially uncharacterized, although
earlier stages of differentiation represent the more likely
point at which pRB deficiency leaves osteoblasts susceptible
to tumorigenesis (1, 6).
Induction of tissue-specific genes is critically dependent
on the ATPase-powered SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling
complex, which repositions nucleosomes to block or unblock
transcription (11). In mammals, an option of alternative subunits provides a means of distinguishing some SWI/SNF functions, with two choices for the ATPase core: BRM or BRG1.
The essential role of BRG1 in activation of tissue-specific
genes is well established, but we have recently shown that
BRM-containing SWI/SNF exerts a counterbalancing repression function in osteoblast precursors, directly opposing the
activating effect of BRG1 and helping to maintain the preosteoblast state until appropriate signals for terminal differentiation (12). pRB is thought to recruit SWI/SNF to repress cell
cycle–specific genes (13), but potential cooperation between
pRB and SWI/SNF in gene activation has not been addressed.
These questions were approached using derivatives of the
nontransformed preosteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 (14, 15),

engineered to express variants of the adenovirus E1A oncogene. DNA tumor virus oncogenes such as E1A mimic pathways of carcinogenesis, making them highly informative
physiologic probes. The pRB family and the transcriptional
coactivating acetyltransferases p300 and CBP are the critical
targets of E1A functions that block differentiation and cell
cycle arrest. They are targeted through genetically separable
sites on E1A, so E1A variants can distinguish family-specific
effects (Fig. 1A). These probes, in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, identify the alkaline phosphatase gene Alpl as a direct promoter activation target of

pRB. Alkaline phosphatase is the major early-stage marker of
osteoblast differentiation and is regulated coordinately with
differentiation-associated cell cycle arrest. One role of pRB discernible on Alpl is to displace the repressor KDM5A/RBP2,
thereby favoring accumulation of a histone methylation signal
associated with promoter activation. A major new aspect of
pRB-mediated transcriptional activation revealed on Alpl is
the essential role of pRB in recruitment of the activating
BRG1-containing form of SWI/SNF.

Materials and Methods
Expression assays and cells
Low-passage MC3T3-E1 cells were a gift from Roland
Baron (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Fresh aliquots
thawed from liquid nitrogen are generally passaged for no
more than three months. Each new aliquot is authenticated
for the osteoblast phenotype by staining for alkaline phosphatase and the mineralization phenotype following induction
with ascorbic acid and β-glycerol phosphate (4). Northern
blotting, in situ staining for alkaline phosphatase activity,
differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells by exposure to ascorbic
acid and β-glycerol phosphate, and generation of the BRM.
GG5 and BRG1.D16 knockdown lines have been described
(4, 12, 15). Lines expressing E1A 12S.RG2 were isolated as
described for 12S.YH47/928 (4). pRB-depleted lines were
generated using the Origene HuSH system and puromycin
selection. Sequences 1 and 2 respectively were 5′-CCTGTG
CTCTTGAAGTTGTAATGGCTACG and 5′-CCTTACGGATTCCTGGAGGTAACATCTAT.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Primers 5′-GGCTGGGACAGACAGAATGT and 5′-CTGC
AACAGGCAGGGTAAC amplify the Alpl sequence between
-163 and -535 (16). Primers 5′-TTGTTCCTCTTGCCTCAGGT
and 5-TGACAATCACATGGCCTCTC amplify a sequence in
the 3′ untranslated region of Alpl (17). Antibodies were
obtained either from Santa Cruz: pRB (sc-50x), p107
(sc-318), p300 (sc-584), CBP (sc-583), BRM (sc-6450), BRG1
(sc-10768), TFIIB (sc-225), TFIID (sc-204), and RNA polymerase-II (sc-9001); from Millipore: monomethyl-histone H3 lysine 4 (07-436), dimethyl-histone H3 lysine 4 (07-030),
trimethyl-histone H3 lysine 4 (04-745); from BD Transduction
Lab: p130 (610261); or from Abcam: KDM5A/RBP2 (ab65769).
The normal mouse IgG control antibody is a component of
the EZ ChIP system (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed
as described (12).

Results
Induction of alkaline phosphatase
Alpl is induced early in osteoblast differentiation concomitantly with differentiation-associated cell cycle arrest. In an
earlier study, stable expression of E1A in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts severely impaired induction of Alpl and blocked
differentiation to the mineralization phenotype (4). The

normal parental cells show the timing of Alpl

separate contributions of the pRB and p300 families were
assessed here in lines stably expressing appropriate E1A
mutants (Fig. 1A). Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B) shows
that induction of Alpl is greatly impaired by sequestration
of either family. Impaired expression is also apparent at
the level of enzyme activity in an in situ staining assay,
again indicating that the pRB family is actively required for
proper induction of Alpl during osteoblast differentiation
(Fig. 1C). BRG1 depletion in the same background likewise
impairs Alpl induction, whereas BRM depletion accelerates
induction (Fig. 1D), consistent with their respective roles
in activation versus repression of osteoblast-specific gene
expression (12).
The pRB family and p300 associate directly with the
Alpl promoter and are required for the BRM to
BRG1 switch
ChIP analysis (Fig. 2, top) detects all three pRB family
members in direct association with the promoter. Occupation by p130 (lane 5) correlates specifically with repression
(day 0), implying that p130 is part of a repressor complex
as has been described in cell cycle studies (18). In contrast,
pRB and p107 occupy the promoter specifically during activation (days 4 and 7), and concurrent with association of the
global coactivator p300. (CBP was not detected although the
antibody scored positive in corresponding controls, not
shown). Parallel ChIP analysis reveals that Alpl is also a direct
target of SWI/SNF complexes (lanes 8 and 9), and that the
occupying complex changes from a BRM-containing configuration on the repressed promoter to a BRG1-containing
configuration on the activated promoter.

Corresponding analysis in cells expressing the E1A variants shows a precise interplay between the E1A targets
and the two forms of SWI/SNF. When the p300 family is targeted (Fig. 2, second panel), all the pRB family proteins associate with the promoter at the appropriate times, but BRM
fails to dissociate. In contrast, when the pRB family is targeted (Fig. 2, third panel), p300 associates normally and
BRM dissociates successfully, but the activating BRG1-containing SWI/SNF configuration fails to occupy the promoter.
Recruitment of BRG1 and pRB/p107 is not mutually dependent, as promoter occupation by pRB/p107 is successful in a
BRG1-depleted line (Fig. 2, bottom). BRM dissociation is also
independent of BRG1 (Fig. 2, bottom), meaning that displacement does not require direct competition from BRG1containing complexes. These dynamics reveal an ordered
two-step process in induction of Alpl, in which p300 is
required for dissociation of a repressing BRM-specific form
of SWI/SNF, and pRB/p107 is required for recruitment of
an activating BRG1-specific form of SWI/SNF.
BRG1 is required for recruitment of RNA polymerase-II
ChIP analysis was also used to probe the association dynamics of basal transcription factors (Fig. 3A, top). TFIIB
and TFIID are present even on the noninduced Alpl promoter
in parental cells, but detection of RNA polymerase-II (pol-II)
correlates with activation, and fails in the BRG1-depleted
cell line (second panel). Whatever priming steps may be possible in the absence of BRG1, the crucial step of RNA polymerase recruitment depends substantially on the integrity of
BRG1-specific complexes. BRG1-specific SWI/SNF recruitment fails when either family of E1A targets is subverted,

and thus RNA polymerase recruitment fails as well (third and
fourth panels).
pRB family function is required for hypermethylation
of H3K4
An important event characteristic of activated promoters
is trimethylation at lysine-4 of histone H3 (H3K4; ref. 19).
Hypermethylation of Alpl can be seen in normal cells
as the methylation pattern shifts from one that includes
the monomethylated form at day 0 to a pattern in which only
dimethylated and trimethylated forms are detectable at day 4
(Fig. 3B, lanes 3 to 5). A potential role for pRB in favoring the

activated, hypermethylated state derives from recent identification of the pRB-targeted protein RBP2 (now designated
KDM5A) as a histone demethylase that specifically removes
a methyl group from dimethylated or trimethylated H3K4
(19). Exogenously expressed pRB can displace KDM5A/
RBP2 from the osteocalcin promoter in pRB-null osteosarcoma cells to relieve repression and promote differentiation
(10). These findings combine to predict that hypermethylation at targeted promoters would be dependent on the
pRB family. This is demonstrable on Alpl, as the monomethylated form of H3K4 persists postinduction when the pRB
family is sequestered (Fig. 3B, middle). Probing directly for

the presence of KDM5A shows the demethylase does indeed
occupy the repressed Alpl promoter (lane 8) and dissociates
concurrent with activation and consistent with the shift in
methylation pattern. When the pRB family is sequestered,
KDM5A fails to dissociate. Sequestering the p300 family

pattern (Fig. 3B, bottom).

signal (lanes 3 and 4). Depletion of pRB results in failure to
displace KDM5A and persistence of H3K4 monomethylation
(lanes 5 and 6), as well as failure to recruit BRG1 and RNA
polymerase-II (lanes 9 and 11). Thus, whatever the contribution
of p107, each of these promoter events requires pRB specifically.

Discussion
Specific requirement for pRB
E1A is a valuable physiologic probe, but it does not distinguish between individual members of the pRB family. To
address the role of pRB specifically, short-hairpin RNA was
used to generate MC3T3-E1 lines stably depleted of pRB.
Three independent lines were isolated, using two separate
RNA-targeting sequences. Western blots show that pRB depletion in each line is specific with respect to p107 (Fig. 4A).
An in situ staining assay shows severely impaired induction
of alkaline phosphatase in each line (Fig. 4B); thus, p107 is
not sufficient in the absence of pRB to support Alpl activation. A ChIP assay performed in a representative line (Fig.
4C) shows successful p107 association with Alpl, but no detectable pRB on the promoter in response to the induction

The transcriptional activation function of pRB has
emerged as a key factor in understanding the genesis of
osteosarcoma (1, 6, 7). An important new aspect of transactivation by pRB reported here is its essential role in recruitment of BRG1-containing SWI/SNF complexes to a target
promoter. The respective roles of p300 and pRB in orchestrating the switch from BRM to BRG1 on Alpl are illustrated
schematically in Fig. 4D. Displacement of BRM is dependent
on p300 and provides the opportunity for pRB-dependent recruitment of the activating SWI/SNF complex containing
BRG1. Like KDM5A, BRG1 contains a canonical pRB-binding
motif, LxCxE, and can partner directly with pRB (13, 20).
BRG1-specific SWI/SNF is required in all tissue types for

Transcriptional Activation by pRB

activation of key tissue-specific genes, and is essential for the
ultimate recruitment of RNA polymerase-II to enact transcription on Alpl. These properties imply that recruitment
of activating SWI/SNF complexes is a central component of
transcriptional activation by pRB.
Osteocalcin is the best-studied model of osteoblast-specific
gene expression, due to its tightly regulated control and high
level of induction, which remain apparent even in tumor cell
models. The ability of exogenous pRB to displace KDM5A/
RBP2 from the osteocalcin promoter in osteosarcoma cells
revealed repressor competition as a significant aspect of
pRB-mediated transactivation (10, 20). Importantly, the current findings reveal the same mechanism operating dynamically during activation of Alpl in normally differentiating
osteoblasts. Consistent with subsequent recognition of the
H3K4 demethylase activity of KDM5A (19), ChIP assays show
directly that an activating shift in the H3K4 methylation
pattern of Alpl is dependent on pRB.
Only a limited number of direct promoter targets of pRBdependent gene activation have been identified to date, but
the correlation between direct targeting and an activation
function is strong in osteoblasts. In contrast, evidence for
direct targeting of cell cycle genes by pRB during repression
is conflicting, and some models favor indirect mechanisms
of repression (2, 3). Historically, pRB function has mostly
been studied in epithelial cells, the natural hosts of the
DNA tumor viruses that first linked the pRB family with cell
cycle repression. Nevertheless, epithelial cell models, where
pRB is less associated with tissue-specific gene activation,

may have obscured the more important activation role of
pRB in tumor susceptibility.
Other direct promoter targets of SWI/SNF in osteoblasts are
emerging (12), and as these become more fully characterized
it will be interesting to know whether pRB contributes to the
activation of these genes as well. Regardless, Alpl is a highly
significant target because the enzyme product is critical for
terminal differentiation and because the timing of activation
is closely linked with differentiation-dependent cell cycle
arrest. Although malignant osteosarcoma cells may go on to
express alkaline phosphatase, the transition towards terminal
differentiation is the most likely point at which deficiency
of pRB leaves osteoblasts susceptible to tumorigenesis (1, 6).
Further study of the extent and dynamics of gene targeting by
pRB in osteoblasts and related lineages will likely continue to
increase understanding of the tumor profile associated with
human germ-line mutation of Rb1.
