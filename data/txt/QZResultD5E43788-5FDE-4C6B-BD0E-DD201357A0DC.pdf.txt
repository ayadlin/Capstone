BACKGROUND: Human T-cell leukemia is an aggressive malignancy of T lymphocytes. T-cell leukemia has a very poor
prognosis, even with intensive chemotherapy, indicating the need for development of new drugs to treat the disease.
Triterpenoid cucurbitacins have been shown to have antitumor activity, but the mechanism of this activity is not fully
understood. METHODS: The effects of cucurbitacin D on the proliferation and apoptotic induction of T-cell leukemia
cells using the Cell viability assay and Annexin V staining were evaluated. To investigate the mechanisms of apoptosis,
antiapoptotic protein, NF-jB, and the proteasome activity of leukemia cells treated with cucurbitacin D were
evaluated by Western blotting both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In this study, cucurbitacin D was found to inhibit
proliferation and to induce apoptosis of T-cell leukemia cells. Constitutively activated NF-jB was inhibited by cucurbitacin D in the nucleus, which resulted in accumulation of NF-jB in the cytoplasm, leading to down-regulation of the
expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. Furthermore, cucurbitacin D induced the accumulation of
inhibitor of NF-jB (IjB)a by inhibition of proteasome activity. Low doses of cucurbitacin D synergistically potentiated
the antiproliferative effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor VPA. Finally, the proapoptotic and proteasome inhibitory activities of cucurbitacin D also were demonstrated using SCID mice in an in vivo study. CONCLUSIONS: Cucurbitacin D induced apoptosis through suppression of proteasome activity both in vitro and in vivo, making
cucurbitacin D a promising candidate for clinical applications in the treatment of T-cell leukemia. Cancer

Human T-cell leukemia is a highly aggressive disease with a poor prognosis; the median survival of patients in Japan is
6 months.1 The high mortality of patients with this disease, even after intensive chemotherapy, results from many factors
such as rapid growth of large tumor burden and frequent infectious complication.1 Therefore, development of new drugs
for this aggressive disease is urgently needed.
Cucurbitacins are a group of triterpenoids isolated from plant families such as Cucurbitaceae and Cruciferae, which
have been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity and anticancer effects on various tumor types.2 Chemically, the
cucurbitacins are highly diverse, characterized by a tetracyclic cucurbitane nucleus skeleton with a variety of oxygenation
functionalities at different positions. Traditionally, cucurbitacin family members are divided into 12 categories such as
cucurbitacin D, I, and Q.3 Cucurbitacin I and Q suppress proliferation of tumor cells through inhibition of STAT3
phosphorylation.4,5 Recently, we isolated cucurbitacin D from Trichosanthes kirillowii and showed that this compound
can induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro, although the precise mechanism still remains to be
elucidated.6
Induction of tumor cell apoptosis by chemotherapy is important for treatment of cancer. Activated caspase-3 is an
essential mediator of apoptosis.7 The Bcl-2 family is composed of both pro- and antiapoptotic proteins. The suppression
of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 can induce apoptosis.8,9

Original Article

NF-jB has an important effect on cell growth
and inhibition of apoptosis, and constitutive activation of
NF-jB promotes proliferation and tumorigenesis in adult
T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells.10 NF-jB activation is regulated by its upstream kinase, the IKK complex, which is
composed of 2 catalytic subunits, IKK1/a and IKK2/b,
and a scaffolding protein, NF-jB essential modulator
(NEMO). In resting T cells, NF-jB forms a tight complex with inhibitor of NF-jB (IjBa, IjBb, IjBe), which
inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF-jB. Activated
IKK phosphorylates IjB, which triggers ubiquitination
and proteasome-dependent degradation of IjB. Active
NF-jB is then translocated to the nucleus, where it
regulates an array of genes responsible for cell survival and
growth.11 Inhibitors of NF-jB activity have been reported
to effectively induce apoptosis in ATL cell lines and
primary ATL cells.12
The proteasome is an abundant catalytic complex
found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic
cells. Proteasome-mediated degradation plays an essential
role in the regulation of most intracellular proteins such as
NF-jB.13 Recently, proteasome inhibitors have been used
as new anticancer therapies. Bortezomib is the first
proteasome inhibitor to enter clinical development as a
new therapy for treatment of cancer patients.14 Bortezomib induces cell-cycle blockage and cell apoptosis in
several cancer cell lines through suppression of NF-jB
activity.15 Furthermore, bortezomib mediates anti-ATL
activity by inducing caspase activation, suppressing the
expression of the antiapoptotic protein XIAP.16
Combination with other inhibitor is important for
the chemotherapy effect toward malignancy.17 Histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors block the activity of
histone deacetylase, which is involved in the expression
of a variety of genes responsible for cell-cycle progression
or induction of apoptosis.18 Numerous HDAC inhibitors
have been found to inhibit cell proliferation and
induce apoptosis. Recently, many studies demonstrated
proteasome inhibitor to interact synergistically with
HDAC inhibitors to induce apoptosis of leukemia
cells.19,20
In this article, we show that cucurbitacin D inhibits
proliferation and induces apoptosis in human T-cell
leukemia cell lines with reduced expression of Bcl-xL and
Bcl-2. Furthermore, cucurbitacin D inhibits proteasome
activity, resulting in attenuation of NF-jB translocation
to the nucleus. In addition, cucurbitacin D correlates
with HDAC inhibitor to induce synergistic apoptosis in
leukemia cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines and Culture Conditions
The human T-cell leukemia cell lines MT-1, MT-2, MT4, and Hut102 were kindly given by Dr. Mori (Ryukyu
University, Naha, Japan). Hut78 cells were from the Cell
Resource Center of Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan).
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells were obtained
from RIKEN BioResource Center (Tsukuba, Japan). All
cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Bio Whittaker, Walkersville, MD), l-glutamine, and penicillin–streptomycin in humidified 5%
CO2 at 37 C.
Reagents and Antibodies
Cucurbitacin D was purchased from Nacalai Tesque
(Kyoto, Japan) and dissolved in 10% ethanol to a stock
concentration of 1 mg/mL. Antibodies for NF-jB p65
(sc-109, sc-372), Bcl-xL (sc-7195), Bcl-2 (sc-492), IjBa
(sc-371), ubiquitin (sc-9133), Oct1 (sc-232), and Protein
A/G PLUS-Agarose (sc-2003) were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies for
phospho-IKKa/IKKb (#2681) were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Anti-b-actin
antibody (A5441) and valproic acid sodium (P4543)
were generated by Sigma (St. Louis, MO). HRP-conjugated antirabbit IgG (#458), HRP-conjugated antimouse
IgG (NA931VS), Alexa Fluor–labeled rabbit antigoat
antibody (A11078), and MG132 were purchased from
MBL (Nagoya, Japan), Amersham Pharmacia Bioscience
(Buckinghamshire, UK), Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and
Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), respectively.
Preparation of Human Peripheral
Blood Lymphocytes
Peripheral blood lymphocytes were freshly prepared from
20 mL of EDTA-blood from healthy volunteers. Cells
were isolated using Lymphoprep (Axis Shield, Oslo, Norway)
according to the protocol from the manufacturer.
Cell Viability Assay
Cell proliferation was measured using a Cell TiterGlo luminescent cell viability assay system (Promega,
Madison, WI). Leukemia cell lines were plated in 96-well
plates at a density of 1  104/well and incubated with
various concentrations of cucurbitacin D for the indicated
periods. After culture, 20 lL of the assay reagent was
added to each well, and cell lysates were incubated on an

orbital shaker for 30 seconds. Fluorescence was measured
by luminescencer-JNR-II (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan).
Annexin V Staining and Detection of
Apoptotic Cells
Apoptotic cells were measured by annexin V-FITC staining. Briefly, 1  106 cells were treated with cucurbitacin
D for the indicated periods, washed twice in cold PBS,
and incubated with 10 lL of Annexin V-FITC for
30 minutes. Samples were analyzed by an EPICS XL flow
cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Apoptotic
cells were also detected using an APOPercentage Apoptosis Assay Kit (Biocolor, Belfast, Northern Ireland) via
microscopic observation according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation
MT-4 and Hut102 cells were lysed with RIPA lysis
buffer21 for preparation of whole-cell extracts. Equivalent
amounts of protein (10 lg) were resolved on SDS-PAGE
gels, transferred and immobilized on nitrocellulose
membranes (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK), and
probed with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Immunodetection was performed using a chemiluminescence detection system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro,
CA). For immunoprecipitation, samples were incubated
with immunoprecipitation antibody and Protein A/G
PLUS-Agarose overnight. After washing 3 times with cold
PBS, the precipitated proteins were eluted with sample
buffer (0.5M Tris, 10% SDS, and bromophenol blue in
50% glycerol).
Transfection and Luciferase Assay
MT-4 and Hut102 cells were transfected with the transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) at 3 lL of reagent per microgram of DNA,
as previously reported.22 Briefly, the Bcl-xL or NF-jB
luciferase reporter construct and expression vectors were
added to 90% confluent cells in 24-well culture plates.
Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were stimulated
with cucurbitacin D. After an additional 6 hours of
incubation, the cells were lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer
(Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was
measured using a luminescencer-JNR-II.
Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and
Cytoplasmic Fractions
After treatment with cucurbitacin D for the indicated
periods, nuclear extracts and cytoplasm fractions were

Cancer

prepared from Hut102 and MT-4 cells using a NucBuster
protein Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany).
Immunocytochemical Analysis
Hut102 cells were inoculated at 1  105 cells per well in
4-well chamber slides (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA). After
6 hours of stimulation with cucurbitacin D, cells were
washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After washing, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% saponin in 1%
BSA in PBS for 15 minutes. Cells were stained with antiNF-jB antibody (1:1000) for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the slides were incubated
for 1 hour with Alexa Fluor 488 rabbit antigoat antibody
(1:1000) at room temperature. Thereafter, slides were
washed with PBS and mounted with coverslips. The immunostained slides were observed using a confocal fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
Proteasome Activity Assay
A proteasome activity assay was performed following
cucurbitacin D treatment of tumor cells for the indicated
period. To measure proteasome activity, cultured cells
were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison,
WI), and 50 lL of cell extract was incubated with 50 lL
of fluorogenic substrate (Proteasome-Glo 3-Substrate
System; Promega, Madison, WI) on an orbital shaker for
30 minutes at room temperature. Proteasome activity was
measured using a luminescencer-JNR-II.
In Vivo Studies
Eight- to 12-week-old female CB.17/severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice were purchased
from CLEA Japan (Tokyo, Japan). The SCID mice were
injected intraperitoneally with 4  106 MT-4 or Hut102
cells in 0.2 mL of PBS. Viability of the injected cells was
greater than 90%, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion.
After injection of tumor cells for 1 week, mice were
treated intraperitoneally with vehicle or cucurbitacin D
(1 or 4 mg/kg). Twenty-four hours after cucurbitacin D
injection, tumor cells were collected from the peritoneal
cavity. All animal experiments were performed according
to the guidelines for the care and use of animals, which
was approved by the University of Occupational and
Environmental Health, Japan.
Statistical Analysis
All experiments were repeated more than 3 times, and representative results are shown in the figures. Results are

RESULTS
Cucurbitacin D Inhibits Proliferation
and Induces Apoptosis of Human T-Cell
Leukemia Cells
We first investigated the effects of cucurbitacin D on the
proliferation of T-cell leukemia cell lines MT-1, MT-2,
MT-4, Hut102, Hut78, and Jurkat. Cell proliferation
was inhibited by cucurbitacin D in a dose-dependent

manner, as shown by a cell viability assay (Fig. 1A). MT-4
showed the highest sensitivity to cucurbitacin D treatment
in 6 kinds of leukemia cell lines. Viable cell counts using
Trypan Blue staining also showed that cucurbitacin D
inhibited the cell growth of leukemia cells (data not
shown). Because each cell line was sensitive to cucurbitacin D at a concentration of 1 lg/mL, this concentration
was used for subsequent experiments. Importantly, the
viability of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs)
was not affected by cucurbitacin D (data not shown).
Next, we examined the time course effect of cucurbitacin
D. As shown in Figure 1B, cucurbitacin D showed no
effect within 6 hours but effectively inhibited the growth

2739

Original Article

of tumor cells from 12 hours in a time-dependent
manner. MT-4 and Hut102 cells were used for the following experiments to explore the mechanism.
To clarify the mechanisms by which cucurbitacin D
induced cell death, annexin V levels were analyzed by flow
cytometry because annexin V is known as a marker for
apoptosis. As shown in Figure 1C, the leukemia cells
expressed annexin V after the presence of cucurbitacin D
for 12 hours. Forty-eight hours after cucurbitacin D treatment, about 60% of the cells were positive. To further
examine apoptosis induced by cucurbitacin D, apoptotic
cells stained with purple dye were counted by microscopy.
As shown in Figure 1D, about 35% of the MT-4 cells and
25% of the Hut102 cells treated with cucurbitacin D for
24 hours were apoptotic. The proteasome inhibitor
MG132 was used as a positive control. This result was
consistent with that shown in Figure 1A,B, that MT-4
was more sensitive to cucurbitacin D than were Hut102
cells. Treatment with cucurbitacin D also led to the
appearance of a significant population of cells in the subG1 phase (data not shown). Apoptosis was totally induced
by cucurbitacin D.
Expressions of Bcl-2 Family Proteins Are
Reduced by Cucurbitacin D Through
Inhibition of NF-jB
It is well known that Bcl-2 family proteins play important
roles in protecting tumor cells from apoptosis. We therefore investigated the effects of cucurbitacin D on Bcl-xL
and Bcl-2 by Western blotting. Although the expression
of these proteins was not attenuated in PBLs (Fig. 2B),
cucurbitacin D markedly reduced Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 protein expression after 24 hours both in MT-4 and in
Hut102 cells (Fig. 2A). To confirm this finding, a Bcl-xL
luciferase reporter construct was introduced into leukemia
cells, and luciferase activity was measured. Treatment
with cucurbitacin D resulted in attenuation of Bcl-xL
reporter activity (Fig. 2C, left). We also examined NF-jB
activity because constitutively activated NF-jB has been
observed in T-cell leukemia cells and regulates Bcl-xL
transcription.12 NF-jB reporter activity was also reduced
after incubation with cucurbitacin D (Fig. 2C, middle).
To further characterize the relationship between
NF-jB activity and Bcl-xL expression, MT-4 and
Hut102 cells were cotransfected with p65, a component
of NF-jB, and the Bcl-xL or NF-jB reporter constructs.
It is known that overexpression of p65 is dominant-positive for NF-jB activity in the reporter assay, indicating the
role that overexpressed p65 played in the nucleus.22 As

2740

shown in Figure 2C (right), overexpression of p65 enhanced
NF-jB and Bcl-xL reporter activity in Hut102 cells and was
not inhibited by cucurbitacin D treatment. These results
demonstrate that cucurbitacin D may inhibit Bcl-2 family
protein expression through suppression of NF-jB activity
at the cytoplasmic level, rather than in the nucleus.
Treatment of Cucurbitacin D Induces
Decreased NF-jB in the Nucleus and NF-jB
Accumulation in Cytoplasm
To investigate the mechanism by which cucurbitacin D
suppresses NF-jB activity, the fractions of NF-jB in the
nucleus and cytoplasm were analyzed by Western blot.
The amount of NF-jB in the nucleus decreased after
incubation with cucurbitacin D beginning after 6 hours
without affecting a control protein, Oct1, both in MT-4
and Hut102 cells. NF-jB accumulated in the cytoplasm
beginning after 6 hours of treatment with cucurbitacin D
(Fig. 3A). Accumulation of NF-jB was further observed
by immunohistochemistry. Cucurbitacin D induced the
accumulation of NF-jB in the cytoplasm and reduced its
levels in the nuclei in Hut102 cells (Fig. 3B).
Ubiquitinated Proteins Are Accumulated by
Cucurbitacin D in Leukemia Cells
To investigate the mechanism of NF-jB cytosolic accumulation, the expression of IjBa was examined by Western blot. IjBa forms a tight complex with NF-jB in the
cytoplasm and inhibits the nuclear translocation signal of
NF-jB. Western blot results demonstrated that the level
of IjBa was increased by cucurbitacin D, both in MT-4
and in Hut102 cells (Fig. 4A). Cucurbitacin D also
increased phosphorylation of IKKa/b, an upstream kinase
for NF-jB. Furthermore, increased ubiquitination of
IjBa was detected after stimulation with cucurbitacin D.
Consequently, Western blotting analysis was performed
to analyze the total amount of ubiquitinated proteins after
cucurbitacin D treatment. As shown in Figure 4B, the
increased amount of ubiquitinated protein was seen
beginning after 6 hours of stimulation, both in MT-4 and
in Hut102 cells, suggesting that cucurbitacin D exerts an
inhibitory effect on the proteasome, blocking the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins in leukemia cells.
Cucurbitacin D Inhibits Proteasome
Activity in Leukemia Cells
To determine whether cucurbitacin D influences
proteasome activity, we performed an in vitro assay using
cell lysates from MT-4 and Hut102 cells cultured with
the indicated concentrations of cucurbitacin D for 6 or

leukemia cells.

Cucurbitacin D Induces Apoptosis
of Leukemia Cells In Vivo
The ability of cucurbitacin D to exert effects in vivo was
examined using SCID mice with MT-4 or Hut102 cells.
According to the dose of bortezomib widely used in the
inhibition of tumor growth in mouse experiments, we
used 1 or 4 mg/kg to demonstrate the antitumor activity
of cucurbitacin D in vivo.23 Twenty-four hours after the
administration of cucurbitacin D, strong apoptosis was
induced in Hut102 cells (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, ubiquitinated protein and IjBa were increased in MT-4
and Hut102 cells, suggesting that cucurbitacin D could
inhibit the proteasome system in vivo (Fig. 7B).

inhibited proteasome activity, resulting in the accumulation of ubiquitinated IjBa. Furthermore, increased
ubiquitinated IjBa inhibited NF-jB activity, which
resulted in decreased expression of antiapoptotic proteins
such as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, and thus promoted apoptosis of
leukemia cells.
Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of
apoptosis.24 We showed that Bcl-xL expression and NFjB activity were suppressed by cucurbitacin D. It is well
known that the expression of Bcl-xL is regulated by NFjB at the transcriptional level, supporting the interpretation that cucurbitacin D suppresses Bcl-xL expression via
inhibition of NF-jB.25,26 Bcl-2 expression, which has
been shown to be regulated by STAT327 in addition to
NF-jB,28 was also suppressed by cucurbitacin D. Interestingly, cucurbitacin I, which has been used as a STAT3
inhibitor, has a chemical structure similar to that of

cucurbitacin D.3 Therefore, cucurbitacin D may inhibit
Bcl-2 expression partially through suppression of STAT3
activation.
Constitutively activated NF-jB sustains proliferation of tumor cells and regulates expression of antiapoptotic proteins to protect leukemia cells from
apoptosis.12,29 Therefore, chemicals that inhibit NF-jB
can efficiently induce apoptosis.30,31 Cucurbitacin D
decreased the amount of NF-jB in the nucleus and
increased the accumulation of NF-jB in the cytoplasm
(Fig. 3), which resulted in the induction of apoptosis, suggesting that cucurbitacin D will be a useful chemotherapeutic agent for human T-cell leukemia. In addition, we

observed that cucurbitacin D inhibited NF-jB activity,
mainly in the cytoplasm, because cucurbitacin D
inhibited IjBa degradation and did not suppress NF-jB
activity after transfection of a dominant-positive p65
expression vector into cells (Fig. 2C). However, it is still
unclear whether cucurbitacin D provokes the translocation of constitutively active NF-jB from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm.
Cucurbitacin D inhibited proteasome activity and
blocked the degradation of ubiquitinated IjBa. Because
it is well known that the key regulator of activation of NFjB is IjB,32 the accumulation of ubiquitinated IjB in
cells provides a clear mechanism for the suppression of

NF-jB activity by cucurbitacin D. Importantly, proapoptotic and proteasome inhibitory activities of cucurbitacin
D were also demonstrated in vivo. Therefore, cucurbitacin D is potentially a very useful drug for cancer therapy.
Recently, proteasome inhibitors have also been
developed as new anticancer agents in the clinic. One proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has cytotoxic effects on
various kinds of tumor cells in vitro. Bortezomib can inhibit NF-jB by blocking the degradation of IjBa.33 In
addition, bortezomib was reported to alter the levels of
Bcl-2, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in several
tumor types.34 This indicates that bortezomib has effects
on proteasome inhibition and regulation of NF-jB.
Therefore, cucurbitacin D also may be a new alternative
proteasome inhibitor for the treatment of cancer.
The proteasome is a multisubunit protease that consists of 1 catalytic 20S proteasome and 2 19S regulatory
complexes. The assembly of the proteasome is precisely
regulated by assembly factors at each step.35 Several kinds
of proteasome chaperones have been reported to be dedicated to different steps in proteasome assembly. For example, PAC1-4 promotes a-ring formation by binding to
intermediates of a-subunits. Ump1 mediates the assembly
of the 15S complex to 20S, which inhibits stable dimerization of 15S until the completion of the b-ring assembly.36
Unexpectedly, cucurbitacin D did not directly suppress
the activities of purified 20S or 26S (data not shown).
One possibility is that cucurbitacin D might obstruct the
assembly of the proteasome through interference with
proteasome chaperones, although further research is
required to test this hypothesis. Importantly, cucurbitacin
D and bortezomib inhibit proteasome activity through
different mechanisms.
There has been a growing interest in the use of herbs
as a source of new drugs for cancer. The triterpenoids,
including cucurbitacin, which are ubiquitous constituents
in plants and fruits, have been found to possess anticancer
effects. One of the main targets of cucurbitacins is activated STAT3.4 Blaskovich et al reported that cucurbitacin
I suppressed phosphorylation of STAT3 in cancer cells. In
contrast, the mechanism of cucurbitacin D’s anticancer
effects is different, although its structure is very similar,
suggesting that different cucurbitacins operate via different mechanisms. An important and novel finding
presented here is that cucurbitacin D induced apoptosis in
T-cell leukemia cells via inhibition of the proteasome
system. This finding is the first instance of proteasome inhibition in the cucurbitacin family. Although cucurbitacins may be useful anticancer drugs, they have not yet

been developed because of their general toxicity to normal
cells.37,38 Park et al reported that 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin D did not show apparent toxicity toward normal
cells.39 We also found that cucurbitacin D did not affect
human PBLs from healthy donors. Thus, cucurbitacin D
might be a useful candidate for an anticancer drug.
Our results show that combination chemotherapy
of low doses of cucurbitacin D and HDAC inhibitor
synergistically induced apoptosis in T-cell leukemia cells,
similarly to previous reports that HDAC inhibitor synergizes with other proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib
or MG132.19,40 Previous studies have shown that exposure of tumor cells to HDAC inhibitors such as phenylbutyrate induced inactivation of NF-jB.41 It is still unclear
whether cucurbitacin D affects HDAC activity. However,
previous studies have documented that the potential mechanisms of the synergistic effect between the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib and HDAC inhibitors include
cointerruption of NF-jB activation and aggresome induction.42,43 Further experimentation is needed to explore the
precise mechanism of this synergistic interaction.
Collectively, these data demonstrate that the proteasome inhibitor cucurbitacin D is a potential new therapeutic drug for treatment of T-cell leukemia.
