Abstract
Patient survival in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is limited by acquired chemoresistance. Here we report the
use of a biologically relevant model to identify novel candidate genes mediating in vivo acquired resistance to
etoposide. Candidate genes derived from a cDNA microarray analysis were cloned and transiently overexpressed
to evaluate their potential functional roles. We identified two promising genes in the DNA repair enzyme DNA
polymerase b and in the neuroendocrine transcription factor NKX2.2. Specific inhibition of DNA polymerase b
reduced the numbers of cells surviving treatment with etoposide and increased the amount of DNA damage in
cells. Conversely, stable overexpression of NKX2.2 increased cell survival in response to etoposide in SCLC cell
lines. Consistent with these findings, we found that an absence of nuclear staining for NKX2.2 in SCLC primary
tumors was an independent predictor of improved outcomes in chemotherapy-treated patients. Taken together,
our findings justify future prospective studies to confirm the roles of these molecules in mediating chemotherapy
resistance in SCLC. Cancer Res; 71(14); 4877–87. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 4% of cancer
deaths in the United States each year (1). The standard of
care is a platinum agent and etoposide doublet chemotherapy
(with radiotherapy in limited disease) with a typical disease
trajectory of initial good response followed by rapid relapse
with chemoresistant tumor and death (2, 3). Because surgical
resection is not part of standard care, SCLC research using
primary tumor tissue is limited to small diagnostic samples. A
mouse model has been described (4), but the bulk of SCLC
research has used cell lines. Understandably, chemoresistance
has been a major area of research in SCLC, but it has proved
challenging to translate the results obtained by using cell lines
to patient samples. For example, the in vitro gene expression of
topoisomerase II has been negatively correlated with the IC50
of SCLC cell lines to etoposide (5). However, a subsequent
study of the immunohistochemical expression of topoisomerase IIa in diagnostic samples found that higher expression
was associated with a worse outcome (6), the opposite of what

would be predicted on the basis of the in vitro results. Other
work has been based on the study of cell lines rendered
resistant to chemotherapy by long-term exposure to increasing concentrations of various drugs (7). This assumes a model
of clonal evolution as the basis for the development of
chemoresistance in vivo. However, this may be compromized
when a cell line such as NCI-H69, derived from a patient
already exposed to chemotherapy, is used.
The cell lines GLC-14, GLC-16, and GLC-19 were derived
from a single patient at different time points during her
treatment for SCLC (Fig. 1A) and were originally described
as having differing resistance to etoposide treatment (8). We
have used these lines as a biological model for the development of chemoresistance in vivo and from it, we have identified the novel etoposide resistance factors DNA polymerase b
and NKX2.2.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture
The GLC-14, GLC-16, and GLC-19 cells were the kind gift of
Dr. Nina Pedersen (Copenhagen, Denmark). Short tandem
repeat profiling was done to confirm their origin from a single
patient and they were characterized in comparison to the
original description (8). The COR-L47 cells were obtained from
Cancer Research UK cell services. All cells were grown in
suspension culture by using RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine media
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin 100
units/mL, and streptomycin, 100 mg/mL at 37 C in 5% CO2.
Western blotting
Whole-cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer (1% NP40,
1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 150 mmol/L

Figure 1. Characterization of the cell lines confirms that GLC-16 is most resistant to etoposide-induced cytotoxicity. A, timeline describing the derivation of the
GLC cell line series based on Berendsen and colleagues (8). B, cell survival after etoposide treatment was determined for all 3 cell lines. Dose–response
curves to etoposide at the 48-hour time point were constructed for the 3 cell lines by using the CellTiter Glo assay. GLC-16 cells had the highest
IC50 (n ¼ 4–8). Cell survival 48 hours after treatment with 42 mmol/L etoposide was determined by using CellTiter Glo. Significantly more GLC-16 cells survived
than the other cell lines (n ¼ 12, Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test). C, apoptosis was measured after 48 hours of treatment
with 42 mmol/L etoposide by using the Caspase Glo assay (n ¼ 8, Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn's tests) or by detecting deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) by flow cytometry (n ¼ 5, Mann–Whitney U test). GLC-16 cells exhibited the least apoptosis. D, array comparative
genomic hybridization (aCGH) was done to determine genetic copy number (CN) and heterozygosity status (loss of heterozygosity). Results are shown for
chromosome 2 from 150 to 242 mb for GLC-14 (top), GLC-16 (middle), and GLC-19 (bottom).

sodium chloride, 50 mmol/L Tris, pH ¼ 7.4) supplemented with
complete protease inhibitor (Roche). Protein was quantitated
by using the bicinchoninic acid assay and equal quantities
loaded into appropriate concentration acrylamide gels. After
electrophoresis of denatured samples, the gels were blotted
onto nitrocellulose membrane, probed with appropriate antibodies (NKX2.2 Clone P-20 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or
Pol b, Ab1831 from Abcam), and developed by using enhanced
chemiluminescence.
Luminescence assays
Experiments were prepared in black flat-bottomed 96-well
plates (Nunc) with 1,500 cells in 100 mL of media per well.

Etoposide or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added at an
appropriate concentration and the experiments incubated for
48 hours. In parallel, 2.25  105 cells were prepared in the same
experimental conditions in a flask. Cells were then harvested
from the flask and a single-cell suspension created. From the
single-cell suspension, 500 mL were taken for cell counting on
Vi-Cell XR 2.03 (Beckman Coulter) and 100 mL were pipetted in
technical quadruplicate into spare wells of the experimental
plate to convert luminescent signal to cell number. There were
blank wells containing normal growth medium on each plate.
The plate was loaded into a Clarity Luminometer (Biotek) and
the CellTiter Glo assay (Promega) prepared by mixing the
buffer and substrate. The luminometer was programmed to

automatically inject 100 mL of assay into each well of the plate
and then shake the plate for 10 seconds before incubating it at
room temperature for 10 minutes and reading the luminescent signal. The data were extracted and the raw luminescent
signal converted into a cell count for statistical comparison
after subtraction of background signal. For the NKX2.2 stable
expressing cells, starting cell concentration was determined
by number of available cells.
For Caspase Glo assays, samples were prepared as for the
CellTiter Glo experiments in 96-well plates. Cell counting was
also done so that the caspase signal could be corrected for cell
number. Analysis was done on the Clarity luminometer.
Cloning
PCR primers used to amplify the coding sequence of the
gene of interest from cDNA were designed by using Lasergene
8 software (DNASTAR) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Nucleotide database and supplied by
Sigma Aldrich (Supplementary Table S1). Amplification was
done with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) on a Tetrad 2 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
The reaction mixture contained 10 mL buffer, 1 mL of 10 mmol/
L dNTPs, 0.25 mL of 100 mmol/L solution of each primer, 1 mL
of template, 1.5 mL of DMSO, and 0.5 mL of Phusion (which was
added last). The cycling conditions used were as follows: initial
denaturation for 30 seconds at 98 C, then 35 cycles of 10
seconds denaturation at 98 C, 30 seconds of primer annealing
at an appropriate Tm (Supplementary Table S1) and 15 seconds
of extension per kilobase of amplified product at 72 C, followed
by a final extension step of 72 C for 10 minutes. PCR products
were gel purified by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and
the product purified by using a Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo
Research). Restriction digestion was done and the insert ligated
into the vector by using a Quick Ligation Kit (NEB). An amount
of 50 ng of vector was combined with a 3-fold molar excess of
insert. The product was used to transform 10G DUO Escherichia coli cells (Lucigen). Plasmids were purified by using a
Midiprep Kit (Qiagen) and the sequence was verified by using a
3130  l Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Transfections
A total of 1  106 cells in media without antibiotics were
transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in a ratio
of 5 mL to 1 mg of DNA. After 48 hours, the cells were used in
experiments.
Stable expressing cell lines were generated by using the
pLPC vector and the protocol described by McCurrach and
colleagues (9).
Genomics
DNA was extracted from cultured cells by using a DNeasy
Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) as per the protocol for cultured
human cells. RNA was extracted from cells or human tissue
samples by using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) following
the animal cells protocol provided. Nucleic acids were quantified by using a nanodrop spectrophotometer and ND-1000 v3.3
software (Nanodrop Technology Inc.). RNA quality was measured by using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)

www.aacrjournals.org

following the RNA 6000 Nano protocol. RNA was hybridized
to Illumina Human WGv3.0 Expression BeadChips. Array
comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was done by
using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 platform.
Flow cytometry
Cells treated with etoposide or DMSO as for the luminescent assays were harvested and a single-cell suspension
created by using 0.05% Trypsin EDTA (Gibco) and gentle
mechanical dissociation by passage through a 23G needle.
For terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL), cells were permeablized in icecold 70% ethanol before staining by using an APO-BrdU
TUNEL Kit (Molecular Probes) and flow cytometry by using
an LSR II (BD Biosciences). Results were processed by using
FlowJo v8.8.4 software (Tree Star Inc.).
For active caspase 3 staining, cells were fixed and permeablized before staining with antiactive caspase 3 (Ab13847,
1:1,000, Abcam) followed by an APC-conjugated secondary
antibody (A-10931, 1:100; Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed on
an LSR II.
For gH2AX foci counting, cells were treated for 90 minutes
with 50 mmol/L etoposide then washed and allowed to recover
for 24 hours in media with 10% serum. Cells were fixed and
permeablized in 2% paraformaldehyde with 0.5% triton X-100
for 30 minutes on ice and then stained with anti-gH2AX antibody (Clone 2F3; Abcam) at a 1:5,000 dilution for 60 minutes on
ice. An Alexa 488–conjugated secondary antibody was used
(Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:1,000 for 60 minutes on ice.
The cells were counterstained with 1 mg/mL propidium iodide
(Sigma Aldrich) and flow cytometry was done with an ImageStream Imaging Flow Cytometer (Amnis). The data were
analyzed by using IDEAS v4.0 software (Amnis). The singlecell building block was used to define the population of interest.
A spot mask was created on the gH2AX channel with 4-fold
pixel intensity over background and 2 pixel minimum diameter.
Subsequently, a 2.5-fold peak mask was created on the spot
mask. A feature was created to apply spot counting analysis to
the peak mask. The feature was batch applied to all image files.
Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry
The tissue microarray (TMA) was stained on a BondMax
Autostainer (Leica). Antigen retrieval was carried out at
100 C in Bond ER2 diluent (for NKX2.2, HPA003468, 1:50;
Atlas Antibodies) or Bond ER1 diluent (for Pol b, Ab26343,
1:200; Abcam), followed by 15 of minutes incubation with
primary antibody at room temperature, 8 minutes of incubation by using a polymer secondary system (Leica), followed by developing with diaminobenzidine by using copper
enhancement. Hematoxylin counterstaining was done automatically on the Bond system and finally the slides were
dehydrated, cleared, and mounted by using a Leica ST5020
attached coverslipper CV5030 (Leica). The slides were then
scanned onto the Ariol system (Genetix) for scoring. Consensus scoring was done by 2 observers (one a senior
pulmonary histopathologist) and data analysis done with
SPSS v17.0 (SPSS Inc.). Scoring was done blinded to the

monoculture and coculture conditions with a false discovery
rate (FDR) adjusted P value cutoff of 0.01.

Results
Statistics
Data analysis was done by using GraphPad Prism 5.01
(GraphPad Software Inc.). Where appropriate, parametric
statistics was used to analyze differences between experimental groups. If an assumption of normality was not valid,
nonparametric analyses were done. In a small number of
experiments, the sample size was low but the magnitude of
the difference between experimental groups was considered to be of importance, so parametric analysis was done.
Where multiple groups existed within a single experiment,
multiple between-group comparisons were made with the
Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn's post-test, or ANOVA with
Bonferroni's post-test, to reduce occurrence of type 1
errors. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant
in 2-sided testing. Data were presented as the mean of "n"
independent experiments, except for the experiments
with the NKX2.2 stable overexpressing cells and the gH2AX
foci counting experiments in which single representative
experimental results were shown from 3 independent
experiments.
Survival analysis was done by using SPSS v17.0 (SPSS Inc).
Univariable survival analysis used the log-rank test and multivariable analysis was done by Cox regression by using a
forward stepwise model based on likelihood ratios.
Array CGH quality control was done by using the Affymetrix
Genotyping Console (GTC) v3.0.1 software. The data were
preprocessed and normalized by using the CN5 approach in
GTC (10). Both genotyping and loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
data were determined by using GTC and the normalized data
were then segmented by using the circular binary algorithm,
which is implemented in DNAcopy, a Bioconductor package.
GenomeGraphs was used to create genome plots for both copy
number and LOH data, and the Broad Institute's Integrative
Genome Browser (IGV: http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv)
was also used to view the results.
Gene expression microarray data preprocessing, quality
assessment, and analysis were done by using the Bioconductor packages beadarray and limma in the R computing
environment (11, 12). The quality of bead-level data was
assessed by using various microarray and box plots and any
spatial artifacts identified and removed by using BASH in
beadarray (13). The raw bead-level data were log2 transformed, bead summarized, and then quantile normalized. A
linear model was fitted to the normalized data by using
limma, and computation of any differential gene expression
involved calculating the log2 fold change in expression of
genes for pairwise contrasts between the groups of interest.
Significance of the observed gene expression changes was
calculated by using the empirical Bayes approach, which
calculated the modified t statistic, the modified F statistic,
and the B statistic (the Bayes log posterior odds). Gene lists
were constructed on the basis of genes that were observed to
have a log2 fold change of more than 1 or less than 1 for
each paired comparison between all 3 GLC cell lines in

The GLC cell lines
The GLC-14, GLC-16, and GLC-19 cell lines were obtained
from the laboratory of Dr. Nina Pederesen (Copenhagen,
Denmark). Short tandem repeat profiling confirmed that all
3 lines were derived from a single person. In the original
description of the lines, the GLC-16 line, derived after chemotherapy, was the most resistant to etoposide treatment (8).
In this study, the phenotype was confirmed by using a
luminescent cell viability assay (CellTiter Glo; Promega). After
48 hours of treatment with etoposide, the IC50 for the GLC-14
line was 12.4 mmol/L [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.9–17.3],
for GLC-16 was 51.8 mmol/L (30.7–87.3), and for GLC-19 was
13.1 mmol/L (8.8–19.5; Fig. 1B). Nearly twice as many GLC-16
cells compared with GLC-14 cells were viable after a dose of
42 mmol/L of etoposide for 48 hours. With the same exposure,
there was more active caspase 3 and 7 per cell in the GLC-14
line compared with the GLC-16 line and more TUNEL-positive
cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C).
There are several models that have been proposed to
describe the development of chemoresistance in tumors as
highlighted by Agarwal and Kaye (14) in the context of ovarian
cancer. The original description of the GLC-14, GLC-16, and
GLC-19 cell lines implies that they evolved in a linear manner
from earliest to latest under the selection pressure of treatment, that is, the GLC-19 cell line was descended via the GLC16 cell line from the GLC-14 cell line. The patterns of DNA
copy number and heterozygosity within the 3 cell lines were
compared by using aCGH (SNP 6.0; Affymetrix). By using this
approach, we were able to show that, although the cell lines
are very similar, it is clear that all 3 cell lines were present as
distinct clones prior to the isolation of the GLC-14 line. In Fig.
1D, copy number and LOH are plotted for chromosome 2q
from 150 Mb to 242 Mb, for each of the cell lines. If the GLC-14
cell line had become the GLC-16 line through evolution
under the selection pressure of chemotherapy, then any areas
of LOH in the GLC-14 cell line would have to be preserved in
subsequent cell lines (Fig. 1D, top). However, because the
GLC-16 cell line (Fig. 1D, middle) has an area of heterozygosity
around 240 Mb that is not present in the GLC-14 cell line, they
must have been distinct from each other prior to the isolation
of GLC-14. The GLC-19 line has very little LOH within it
(Fig. 1D, bottom) and neither of the main areas of loss from
the GLC-14 or GLC-16 cell lines are present so it too must have
been a distinct clone prior to the derivation of the GLC-14 line.
Determinants of etoposide response
To identify genes that might be involved in etoposide
response in SCLC, RNA was extracted from each of the cell
lines and gene expression analyzed by using an Illumina Human
WGv3.0 Expression BeadChip microarray. Gene expression was
compared by pairwise subtraction of normalized expression
levels for each gene to determine differential expression between
cell lines (Fig. 2). Genes with an expression pattern that was

for instance c-Myc was expressed at a higher level in the GLC-16
and GLC-19 cells whereas n-Myc was expressed at the highest
level in the GLC-14 cells. ALDH1A1 was expressed at low level in
GLC-14 cells with the expression level rising in the GLC-16 cells
and at its highest in the GLC-19 cells; this gene has been used as a
stem cell marker but is also associated with cyclophosphamide
resistance (15).
To determine if the candidate genes were able to alter the
phenotypic response of the cancer cells to etoposide, a transient overexpression experiment was conducted. Each candidate gene was cloned from the cell line in which it was
expressed at the highest level, inserted into an IRES-GFP
expression vector (Clontech) and transiently expressed into
the cell line in which it was normally expressed at the lowest
level. Cells expressing the gene of interest were treated for 48
hours with 42 mmol/L etoposide, and the proportion of GFPexpressing cells was determined by flow cytometry. Genes that
promoted etoposide resistance would be expected to lead to
enrichment of the GFP-positive cell population compared
with empty vector–transfected cells, and genes that increased
sensitivity to etoposide-induced cytotoxicity would reduce the
proportion of GFP-expressing cells. From this screen of all the
candidate genes, NKX2.2 and DNA polymerase b (Pol b) were
selected as the most promising for further study.
DNA polymerase b
The gene expression pattern of Pol b in the GLC-14 and
GLC-16 cell lines was confirmed at the protein level by
Western blotting (Fig. 3A). The gene was cloned from the
GLC-16 cell line and transiently expressed in the GLC-14 cell
line (Fig. 3A). When the transiently expressing GLC-14 cells
were treated for 48 hours with either etoposide or vehicle
control, there was enrichment of the transfected cells as
measured by GFP expression. Simultaneous detection of
active caspase 3 showed that more of the etoposide-treated,
Pol b–transfected cells were nonapoptotic compared with the
empty vector controls (Fig. 3B), but there was no difference
between the numbers of apoptotic cells. This suggests that Pol
b is protecting the cells from etoposide-induced apoptosis.
Pamoic acid (PA) is a natural inhibitor of Pol b that has
previously been characterized (16). GLC-16 cells were treated

4882

Cancer Res; 71(14) July 15, 2011

with etoposide or vehicle control and the effects of Pol b
inhibition were determined by treatment with PA. PA sensitized the cells to etoposide-induced cell death with lower
luminescence generated by the cells exposed to PA (Fig. 3C).
The cytotoxic effect of etoposide is caused by the generation of
double-strand breaks in DNA, which can be visualized by the
detection of the phosporylated form of histone H2AX
(gH2AX), recruited to the site of the stand breaks (17). To
confirm that the protective effect of Pol b was through
prevention of etoposide-promoted DNA double-strand breaks,
GLC-16 cells were exposed to etoposide for 90 minutes and
then allowed to recover for 24 hours before having the number
of unrepaired double-strand breaks per cell ascertained on an
Imaging Flow Cytometer (ImageStream; Amnis). Inhibition of
Pol b by using PA prior to treatment with etoposide resulted in
significantly more gH2AX foci being detected per cell (Fig. 3D).
NKX2.2
The protein levels of NKX2.2 in untreated GLC-14 and GLC16 cells conformed to the pattern of gene expression in the cell
lines, with more NKX2.2 in the GLC-16 line (Fig. 4A). The gene
was cloned from the GLC-16 line and inserted into the pIRESGFP vector. This was then used to transiently overexpress
NKX2.2 in the GLC-14 cell line (Fig. 4A). GLC-14 cells transfected with either the pIRES-GFP NKX2.2 construct or pIRESGFP empty vector were treated with 42 mmol/L etoposide or
vehicle control for 48 hours. There was significant enrichment
of GFP-positive cells in the NKX2.2-expressing cells compared
with the empty vector–transfected cells, but this enrichment
consisted of an enrichment of both apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells (Fig. 4B).
To further study the effect of NKX2.2, stable overexpression
of the gene in the GLC-14 cell line was achieved by using
retroviral-mediated gene transfer in a pLPC vector (ref. 9;
Fig. 4C). When these cells were treated with etoposide, 50
mmol/L for 48 hours, significantly more NKX2.2-expressing
cells survived compared with empty vector control cells. To
show that this was not a cell line–specific effect, an unrelated
SCLC cell line, COR-L47, was obtained. This cell line was
originally derived from a patient who had not previously been
treated for SCLC (18). A stable NKX2.2-overexpressing cell line
was established as for the GLC-14 line, and this too showed
increased cell survival after etoposide treatment (Fig. 4D).
Tissue microarray
We have previously described the construction and use of a
TMA of SCLC cases to determine the prognostic or predictive
influence of tumor proteins in SCLC patients (19). This TMA
was used to determine whether Pol b or NKX2.2 expression
had relevance to the survival of patients with SCLC. Most
cases stained for Pol b were positive (86%), but there was no
relationship detectable between Pol b staining extent or
intensity and survival or response to chemotherapy. For
NKX2.2, there was a significant difference in survival between
patients treated with chemotherapy whose diagnostic biopsy
had nuclear staining compared with those in whom there was
no nuclear staining (Fig. 5). Absence of nuclear staining for
NKX2.2 in the diagnostic biopsy sample was an independent

Figure 3. DNA polymerase b contributes to the repair of DNA damage caused by etoposide. A, Pol b is expressed at the highest level in untreated GLC-16
cells, consistent with the gene expression data. A pIRES-GFP construct was used to express Pol b cloned from the GLC-16 cell line into the GLC-14 cells.
B, GLC-14 cells transiently transfected with either pIRES POLB or the pIRES empty vector (EV) were treated with 42 mmol/L etoposide for 48 hours
and then expression of GFP and active caspase 3 were detected by flow cytometry. There were more active caspase 3 negative (nonapoptotic)
Pol b–transfected cells compared with empty vector–transfected controls (n ¼ 5, paired t test), but there was no difference in the number of active caspase
3–positive (apoptotic) cells. This suggests that Pol b expression makes the GLC-14 cells better able to survive treatment with etoposide. C, to see if
inhibition of Pol b rendered the cells more sensitive to etoposide, GLC-16 cells were either treated with the selective Pol b inhibitor PA (300 mmol/L)
or left untreated prior to treatment with etoposide or DMSO control for 48 hours. PA reduced the number of cells surviving treatment with etoposide but
had no effect on controls (n ¼ 6). The experiment was repeated a further 4 times by using a concentration of 25 mmol/L etoposide with the same result.
D, to confirm that Pol b promoted cell survival by protecting the cells from etoposide-induced DNA damage, GLC-16 cells treated with PA or untreated
controls were exposed to 50 mmol/L etoposide or DMSO control for 90 minutes. Cells were then washed and allowed to recover for 24 hours. The
number of gH2AX foci per cell was counted by using an imaging flow cytometer. PA treatment resulted in more foci per cell after etoposide treatment

death of 0.52 (0.33–0.82, P ¼ 0.005; Fig. 5B).

Discussion
It has proven difficult to study the development of chemoresistance in SCLC and this is, at least partly, due to the
inadequacies of the models available and the poor availability
of sufficient quantities of primary tumor material. In this
study, the use of a cell line series in which chemotherapy
resistance was acquired in vivo has allowed the identification
of several potential resistance factors and the characterization
of 2 of these as novel etoposide resistance genes.
Cell viability was selected as the most clinically relevant
measurement of chemotherapy response, as it is the viable
cells that repopulate the tumor after chemotherapy. Overall
viability can be seen as a compound measurement of both the
proportion of cell death and the rate of cell growth. A standard
etoposide dose of 100 to 140 mg/m2 would result in a peak

www.aacrjournals.org

plasma concentration of 10 to 20 mg/mL, and 800 mg/m2 gives
a peak plasma concentration of 100 mg/mL (20). Therefore, in
this study, etoposide was used at either 42 mmol/L (25 mg/mL)
or 50 mmol/L to represent clinically relevant dosing.
The GLC-14, GLC-16, and GLC-19 cell lines were derived
from a single patient during the course of her treatment for
SCLC. By using genomic techniques similar to those of Cooke
and colleagues (21), we have obtained similar results to their
findings in paired ovarian carcinoma cell lines. It is clear that
the 3 cell lines, with their differing phenotypic responses to
etoposide treatment (and also to irradiation; ref. 22) were all
present as distinct clones prior to the derivation of the GLC-14
line. This supports a model of genetic heterogeneity with
multiple subpopulations of cells within a tumor, possibly with
one dominant clone and the others at relatively low numbers.
During treatment, the dominant population may be eradicated or merely supplanted by a clone more suited to the
changed environment. The concept that intratumoral heterogeneity in lung cancer may give rise to subpopulations of

tumor cells with divergent phenotypes is not new, and the
term "endophenotypes" has recently been used to describe the
multiple possible phenotypes within a tumor (23). Although it

homogenous population but instead represents emergence of
a new dominant cellular phenotype from a heterogenous pool
of cells during treatment. This may have fundamental implications for the future study and clinical management of
chemoresistance.
The DNA single-strand break repair enzyme DNA polymerase b is implicated in the repair of DNA lesions induced by
etoposide and consequent cell survival for the first time. It has
already been established that Pol b is an important enzyme for
DNA maintenance in cell replication, in resistance to ionizing
radiation (24), and in resistance to monofunctional alkylating
agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (25). Through overexpression and knockdown studies, Pol b has been implicated
in cisplatin resistance (26–28), where it is able to promote
error-prone synthesis across the platinum adduct. It has been
shown recently that inhibition of Pol b potentiates the cytotoxity of the alkylating agent temozolomide by promotion of
DNA double-strand breaks through conversion of excess
unrepaired single-strand DNA breaks (29). Ionizing radiation
produces several types of DNA lesions, many of which might
require Pol b for their repair. In fact, Pol b–deficient cells are
not especially sensitive to ionizing radiation during growth as
alternative pathways are able to compensate for the deficiency

(24, 30). Etoposide is a DNA topoisomerase II poison that
prevents the religation of topoisomerase II–induced singlestrand breaks. It has been shown that, at clinically relevant
doses (as used in the current study), etoposide causes approximately 2.6 single-strand breaks for every double-strand break
induced (31). This ratio is higher at lower doses of the drug (31,
32) consistent with the "two-drug model" proposed by Bromberg and colleagues (31). In this model, one molecule of drug
will stabilize the cleavage complex at one active site within the
topoisomerase II homodimer to prevent religation. For a
double-strand break to occur, there must be etoposide at
both active sites and this depends on the concentration of
both the drug and the topoisomerase II (31). In this study, it
has been shown that the GLC-16 cell line has higher levels of
Pol b than the GLC-14 or GLC-19 cell lines (Figs. 2 and 3A),
that more GLC-16 cells survive treatment with etoposide than
the other 2 cell lines (Fig. 1B), and that etoposide induces less
DNA damage (as measured by TUNEL staining) in the GLC-16
line than the GLC-14 line (Fig. 1C). Overexpression of Pol b
promoted cell survival during treatment with etoposide
(Fig. 3B). Furthermore inhibition of Pol b with PA reduced
cell survival after etoposide treatment (Fig. 3C) and promoted
the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (Fig. 3D). Therefore, we propose that Pol b is able to prevent etoposideinduced cytotoxicity through its single-strand break repair
function. This hypothesis is strengthened by recent data
showing the conversion of excess unrepaired single-strand
breaks to cytotoxic double-strand breaks after inhibition of Pol
b and treatment with temozolomide (29). Other topoisomerase
II targeting drugs such as teniposide produce an excess of
single-strand DNA breaks (33), as do other agents such as
bleomycin (34), and Pol b may be a determinant of cytotoxicity
for these drugs as well. The data do not allow conclusions to be
drawn about the clinical importance of this, as the TMA did not
show a difference in patient outcome based on Pol b expression. However, the high levels of Pol b expression in the cases
on the TMA and the fact that Pol b is also implicated in
resistance to cisplatin, the other major chemotherapeutic used
to treat SCLC, may make it a worthwhile drug target, particularly in relapsed drug-resistant disease.
Little is known about the transcription factor NKX2.2 in
cancer. It is a member of the Nk-2 family of homeobox
transcription factors and is important in the development of
the endocrine pancreas and central nervous system (35, 36).
It is chromosomally linked to NKX2.4 and the linked pair has
a paralogous relationship with NKX2.9 and NKX2.1 (37).
NKX2.1 (also known as thyroid transcription factor-1,
TTF-1) is used in the diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinomas and has been shown to be predictive of poor outcome
in non-SCLC (38).
In this study, NKX2.2 has been shown to be expressed at a
higher level in cells that are more resistant to etoposide (Figs.
1B, 2 and 4A, Table 1). Overexpression of NKX2.2 in the GLC-14
cell line (Fig. 4C) and in an unrelated chemotherapy-naïve
SCLC cell line (Fig. 4D) resulted in an increase in cell survival
after etoposide treatment compared with empty vector–transfected cells. In patient samples, those with nuclear expression
of NKX2.2 (in which the transcription factor would be

expected to exert its effect) had a worse outcome after
chemotherapy than did those without nuclear expression
(Fig. 5). NKX2.2 has been shown to be necessary for oncogenesis in Ewing's Sarcoma in which it acts as a transcriptional
repressor (39). In a mouse model of prostate cancer, Nkx2.2
expression was associated with advanced disease and neuroendocrine differentiation (40) and in Nkx2.2 null mice, there
are fewer neuroendocrine cells in the gut (41). This leads to the
hypothesis that NKX2.2 may be an important regulator of the
neuroendocrine phenotype in SCLC, potentially making it a
key effector in the biology of SCLC.
In this study, we have provided evolutionary evidence of
the existence of endophenotypes in primary SCLC, some of
which have the capacity to cause chemotherapy-resistant
relapse. By using a cell line model of etoposide resistance
developed in vivo, we have identified and characterized 2
genes, POLB and NKX2.2, which confer resistance to etoposide in vitro. We have shown, for the first time, that DNA
single-strand break repair by Pol b can prevent etoposideinduced cell death. This finding has potential implications
for future chemotherapy for SCLC, which may be enhanced
by inhibition of this pathway. The transcription factor
NKX2.2 may be important in the generation of the neuroendocrine phenotype of SCLC, but the exact role in SCLC and
etoposide resistance is currently unknown. Our studies show
that it is able to promote cell survival in vitro and that
nuclear expression of the transcription factor in diagnostic
biopsy samples defines a population of patients with poorer
outcome from chemotherapy.

This study has highlighted several potential etoposide
resistance factors (Table 1) and we have been able to further
characterize 2 of them. This implies that the overall resistance
of phenotype may be a consequence of the interactions of
multiple resistance modifying factors rather than being
dependent upon one easily targeted factor, and this has
consequences for treatment.
