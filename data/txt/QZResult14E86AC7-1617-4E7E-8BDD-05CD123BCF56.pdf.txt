genes and enhance transcriptional rates upon binding of RA (4–6).
The transcriptional activities of RA are also mediated by a small
soluble protein termed cellular RA-binding protein II (CRABP-II;
refs. 7, 8). Upon binding of RA, CRABP-II mobilizes from the cytosol
to the nucleus where it directly ‘‘channels’’ RA to RAR, thereby
facilitating delivery of RA to the receptor and enhancing its
transcriptional activity (9–11). Consequently, ectopic expression of
CRABP-II sensitizes cultured mammary carcinoma cells to the
growth inhibitory effects of RA and suppresses the tumor
development in two mouse models of breast cancer (10, 12).
The pathways that underlie the anticarcinogenic activities of RA
vary between different cell types. RA induces a G1-G0 growth arrest
in embryonic teratocarcinoma F9 cells (13), differentiation in
myeloid HL-60 cells (14), and apoptosis in NB4 acute promyelocytic
leukemia cells (15). However, information on direct target genes
that mediate the antiproliferative activities of RAR remains scarce.
It was reported that RA-induced apoptosis and differentiation in
NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells involve ubiquitin-activating
enzyme E1-like protein, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein q, and
tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (16–18).
Several genes (i.e., Bcl-2, survivin, the tumor suppressor gene
PDCD4, the transcription factor SOX9, and, importantly, cyclin D1)
were reported to be down-regulated in conjunction with RAinduced growth inhibition in breast cancer cells (19–24). However,
as liganded RAR usually functions as a transcriptional activator,
these genes are unlikely to comprise direct targets, and the
mechanisms by which RA regulates their expression are unknown.
Recently, we showed that RA-induced apoptosis in the mammary
carcinoma MCF-7 cells is associated with up-regulation of the
expression of the proapoptotic genes caspase-7 and caspase-9 (11)
and with increased activation of these serine proteases. Although
caspase-7 seems to be an indirect responder, caspase-9 was found
to be a direct target for RAR and is thus an important mediator of
RA-induced apoptosis in these cells.
Notably, inhibition of MCF-7 cell growth by RA seems to be a
multifaceted process involving the induction of both apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest (25–27). The present study was undertaken to
obtain insights into the initial cell cycle response, identify direct
RAR target genes that are involved in this response, and examine
the contribution of CRABP-II to the process.

Abstract
The anticarcinogenic activities of retinoic acid (RA) are
believed to be mediated by the nuclear RA receptor (RAR)
and by the RA-binding protein cellular RA-binding protein-II
(CRABP-II). In MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells, growth
inhibition by RA entails an early cell cycle arrest followed by
induction of apoptosis. Here, we aimed to obtain insights into
the initial cell cycle response. We show that a 3- to 5-h RA
pulse is sufficient for inducing a robust growth arrest 2 to 4
days later, demonstrating inhibition of the G1-S transition by
RA is triggered by immediate-early RAR targets and does not
require the continuous presence of the hormone throughout
the arrest program. Expression array analyses revealed that
RA induces the expression of several genes involved in cell
cycle regulation, including the p53-controlled antiproliferative gene B-cell translocation gene, member 2 (Btg2) and the
BTG family member Tob1. We show that induction of Btg2 by
RA does not require de novo protein synthesis and is
augmented by overexpression of CRABP-II. Additionally, we
identify a RA response element in the Btg2 promoter and show
that the element binds retinoid X receptor/RAR heterodimers
in vitro, is occupied by the heterodimers in cells, and can drive
RA-induced activation of a reporter gene. Hence, Btg2 is a
novel direct target for RA signaling. In concert with the
reports that Btg2 inhibits cell cycle progression by downregulating cyclin D1, induction of Btg2 by RA was accompanied by a marked decrease in cyclin D1 expression. The
observations thus show that the antiproliferative activity of
RA in MCF-7 cells is mediated, at least in part, by Btg2. [Cancer

Introduction
The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) plays key roles in
embryonic development and in tissue remodeling in the adult. This
hormone also displays distinct anticarcinogenic activities and is
currently used and being tested in clinical trials as a therapeutic
and preventive agent in several types of cancer (1–3). These
pleiotropic activities are exerted primarily through the ability of RA
to regulate gene expression and are mediated by the nuclear
hormone receptors termed RA receptors (RAR). RARs associate
with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to form heterodimers that bind
to RAR response elements (RARE) in regulatory regions of target

Cancer Research
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy
(Qiagen), and cDNA was generated using GeneAmp RNA PCR (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative real-time PCR was done in
quadruplicates using Taqman chemistry and Assays on Demand probes
(Applied Biosystems) for Btg2 (Hs00198887_m1) and cyclin D1
(Hs00277039_m1). 18S rRNA (4319413E-0312010) was used as a loading
control. Analysis was carried out using the relative standard method
(Applied Biosystems Technical Bulletin No. 2).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The 95-bp oligonucleotide
containing Btg2-RARE was end-labeled with [32P]dCTP by filling in
fragments with Klenow, and free nucleotides were removed (nucleotide
removal kit, Qiagen). The labeled probe (f1 ng) was incubated with
appropriate receptors (100 nmol/L, 20 min) in HEDGK buffer [10 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 8), 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.4 mmol/L DTT, 100 mmol/L KCl, 15%
glycerol] in the absence or presence of unlabeled competitor DNA or a 95bp oligonucleotide of the mutated sequence GGAGGGcgAGGGGGagAGAGGG. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gel
and visualized by autoradiography.
Measurements of RA concentration in cell lysates. MCF-7 cells were
seeded in 60-mm dishes (350,000 per plate) in DMEM containing 10% FBS.
Cells were washed with PBS and treated with RA added in serum-free
DMEM. Media were removed; cells were washed with PBS; and media were
replaced with DMEM. Cells were washed and collected in 1 mL PBS and
pelleted, and ligand was extracted by resuspension in 100% ethanol. Cell
debris was centrifuged, and ethanol was collected and used in subsequent
determinations. Pellets were dissolved in 1 mol/L NaOH (5 h), and protein
content was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). RA
concentrations in ethanol extracts were measured essentially as described
(29). Briefly, bacterially expressed CRABP-I-L28C was purified and labeled
with the fluorescent probe fluorescein, and the labeled protein was used as
a ‘‘readout’’ for its ligand. Standard curves were made by extracting
untreated MCF-7 cells into ethanol containing known concentrations of
RA. Fluorescein-labeled-CRABP-I-L28C (160 nmol/L) was titrated with
the various extracts, and the progress of the titrations was monitored
at k excitation/k emission of 491 nm/519 nm.

Proteins. Recombinant histidine-tagged proteins were expressed in
Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (28). Purified proteins
were dialyzed against HEK buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 8), 0.1 mmol/L
EDTA, 100 mmol/L KCl] and stored at 20jC in 50% glycerol. CRABP-IIL28C was covalently labeled with the environmentally sensitive fluorescent
probe fluorescein using the thiol-reactive 5-(bromomethyl)fluorescein
(BMF; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Protein was incubated with BMF
at a protein/BMF mole ratio of 1:3 in HEK buffer (pH 7.3) for 2 h and
dialyzed against HEK buffer containing 1 mmol/L DTT and 5% glycerol.
Typically, the mole ratio of fluorescein to protein in the resulting labeled
proteins was 0.7 to 1.
Reporter construct. The 95-bp oligonucleotide containing the putative
B-cell translocation gene, member 2 (Btg2) RARE was synthesized with
HindIII and BamHI restriction site overhangs at 5¶ and 3¶ ends, respectively,
and subcloned into the luciferase reporter vector.
Affymetrix expression array analyses were conducted as previously
described (11). Iobion’s GeneTraffic was used to perform robust multi-chip
analysis and cluster genes with similar activity by summary function.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting. MCF-7 cells were seeded in sixwell plates (120,000 per plate) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
and grown overnight. Cells were treated with RA in DMEM containing 1%
FBS and then incubated with 5¶-bromo-2¶-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma,
St. Louis, MO; 30 Ag/mL, 20 min, 37jC). The medium was removed; cells
were washed twice in PBS; trypsinized cells were collected; and cells were
centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL PBS, rapidly injected into
10 mL 70% ethanol, and incubated overnight at 4jC. Cells were centrifuged
and resuspended in 1 mL of 2 N HCl/0.5% Triton X-100. Following a 30-min
incubation, cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 1 mL of 0.1 mol/L
Na2B4O710H2O (pH 8.5) and collected, and 1 mL of dilution buffer (0.5%
Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) was added. Anti-BrdUrd
FITC antibody (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA; 20 AL per 106 cells)
was added, and suspensions were incubated at room temperature for
30 min. Stained cells were washed with 5 mL of dilution buffer and
resuspended in 1 mL PBS containing propidium iodide (Sigma; 5 Ag/mL)
and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. MCF-7 cells were seeded in 100mm plates (2,000,000 per plate) and grown to confluency. Proteins were
cross-linked to DNA (10% formaldehyde, 20 min, 37jC), and the reaction
was quenched by glycine (125 mmol/L, 5 min, 4jC). Cells were washed
twice with PBS, scraped, lysed (1% SDS, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L Tris
at pH 7.9, 1 mmol/L DTT, and protease inhibitors; Roche, Indianapolis,
IN), and incubated (4jC, 45 min). Lysed cells were sonicated to obtain
DNA fragments of 300 to 700 bp. One fifth of samples were stored at 4jC
as an input. The remaining sample was diluted [0.5% Triton X-100,
2 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
DTT, protease inhibitors, salmon sperm DNA] and precleared (1 h, 4jC)
with protein A beads. Following centrifugation, supernatant was
transferred; appropriate antibodies (3.5 Ag) were added; and mixtures
were incubated overnight (4jC). Protein A beads were added (2 h, 4jC);
washed (3) using a buffer containing 0.25% NP40, 0.05% SDS, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 8), 250 mmol/L NaCl, leupeptin, and aprotinin;
and washed once in TE buffer. Beads were resuspended in 100 mmol/L
NaHCO3 containing 1% SDS and incubated to reverse the cross-link
(4 h, 65jC). Proteins were digested with proteinase K (1 h), and DNA was
purified (nucleotide removal kit, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The putative
RARE-containing region of Btg2 was amplified by PCR ( forward primer, 5¶CCCGGCTACACTGTATATTGACTTGG-3¶; reverse primer, 5¶-GGGTTTCATCACGTTGGTCAGGAT-3¶).
Transactivation assays. MCF-7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates
(75,000 per well) in DMEM containing 10% FBS and grown overnight.
Cells were transfected using Fugene (Roche) in DMEM containing 1% FBS
with tk-luciferase reporter vector containing the Btg2 RARE (400 Ag) and
pCH110 encoding h-galactosidase (300 Ag). Following an overnight
incubation, cells were treated with RA in serum-free DMEM for 24 h and
lysed. Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system
(Promega, Madison, WI) and corrected for transfection efficiency by hgalactosidase activity.

Results
MCF-7 cells arrest in G1 in response to RA. MCF-7 cells were
treated with RA (1 Amol/L) for 24 or 72 h, and the cell cycle
distribution was examined using a BrdUrd incorporation assay.
Cells were also stained with propidium iodide, and the fraction of
cell populations in different cell cycle phases was determined by
flow cytometry. The data (Fig. 1A) showed that RA treatment
resulted in a marked increase in the cell population in the G1
phase, leading to an overall 1.8-fold increase at 72 h. The increase
was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in residency in S
and in G2-M phases, showing that RA inhibits the G1-S transition.
In addition to a marked effect on cell cycling, RA also triggered
DNA fragmentation, reflected by an increase of the fraction of
cells in the sub-G1 population. In accordance with a G1 arrest, the
expression level of cyclin D1 mRNA decreased by f2-fold upon
24 h of RA treatment (Fig. 1B).
Rate of degradation of RA in MCF-7 cells. The biological
activities of RA are believed to be mediated by induction of
expression of RAR target genes. However, whereas RA-triggered
changes in gene expression can be observed within several hours,
cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells is observed 1 to 3 days following
treatment (Fig. 1), and an ultimate apoptotic response is
manifested 5 to 7 days later (11). To examine whether a shortterm treatment with RA is sufficient for triggering a subsequent cell
cycle arrest, or whether the response requires the continuous
presence of the ligand, MCF-7 cells were treated with RA; the ligand
was removed from the medium; and cellular responses were

Btg2 Is a Direct Target for RAR

Alternatively, the behavior may reflect the existence of two
intracellular RA pools that degrade at different rates. Regarding
the latter alternative, it is possible that free RA degrades rapidly
with a half-life of f18 min, whereas protein-bound RA is
metabolized at a slower rate characterized by a half-life of 112
min. To address the possibility that binding to CRABP retards the
rate of degradation of RA, we examined the rate of disappearance
of RA in MCF-7 cells in which the expression of CRABP-II was
reduced by f80% by using small interfering RNA technology.
However, RA degradation in cells with reduced CRABP-II
expression followed a similar pattern to that obtained in nontransfected cells (data not shown), suggesting that other mechanisms are responsible for the two-phase disappearance of RA in
MCF-7 cells.
A short-term treatment with RA is sufficient to elicit cell
cycle arrest. The effectiveness of a short-term exposure to RA in
regulating cell cycle events was then examined. MCF-7 cells were
either pulsed with RA for 3 to 5 h or continuously exposed to the
hormone for the entire duration of the experiments, and cell cycle
distribution was analyzed at 2 or 4 days following treatment
initiation (Fig. 3). In cells pulsed with RA, a G1 cell cycle arrest was
Figure 1. RA reduces the expression of cyclin D1 and induces a G1 arrest in
MCF-7 cells. A, MCF-7 cells were treated with vehicle or RA (1 Amol/L) for
24 or 72 h before incubation with BrdUrd (20 min). Cells were then fixed in
ethanol, stained with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibodies and with propidium
iodide, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. B, MCF-7 cells
were treated with vehicle or RA (1 Amol/L) for 24 h, total RNA was extracted,
and cyclin D1 mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Values were

monitored. To assess whether removal of RA from the medium
indeed results in rapid depletion of the RA stores of the cell, the
half-life of RA in MCF-7 cells was measured.
The concentrations of RA in MCF-7 cells were measured using
our recently described fluorescence-based method (29). This
method uses CRABP-I, a protein that binds RA with strict
selectivity and high binding affinity, as a ‘‘readout’’ for this ligand.
A CRABP-I mutant in which L28 has been replaced with a cysteine
is covalently labeled with the fluorescent probe fluorescein. Ligand
binding by the labeled protein leads to a decrease in the
fluorescence of the probe, enabling direct measurements of RA
concentration (Fig. 2A). A calibration curve (Fig. 2B) is obtained by
extracting nontreated cells using ethanol containing known
amounts of RA and titrating labeled CRABP-I-L28C with the
extracts to obtain initial slopes characterizing the response at each
RA concentration. To measure the rate of degradation of RA in
MCF-7 cells, cells were incubated with RA (1 Amol/L); the medium
was removed; cells were washed; RA was extracted into ethanol;
and the concentration of RA was measured. The amount of
RA found to accumulate in the cells after 1 h of RA treatment
was found to be 2 to 3 nmol/mg protein (range from three
experiments). Following removal of RA from culture media, the
concentration of RA in the cells decreased rapidly, with f50% of
the ligand disappearing within f20 min (Fig. 2C). Interestingly,
plotting the data on a log scale to extract the rate constant of the
reaction revealed that RA degradation is comprised of a two-phase
process (Fig. 2C, inset). These observations may reflect the
existence of two independent degradation mechanisms: a rapid
degradation process characterized by a low K m and a high V max
and a second process displaying a high K m and a low V max.

were treated with vehicle or RA (50 nmol/L, 4 h), and total RNA
was isolated. Probes were generated and hybridized to Affymetrix
human U133 A/B arrays, monitoring >40,000 genes and expressed
sequence tags. The differences in gene expression profiles between
untreated and RA-treated cells were analyzed. Genes whose
expression levels were up-regulated by RA were clustered by
similar biological functions using the GeneTraffic software system
(Iobion, La Jolla, CA).
Several genes that are known to be involved in cell cycle
regulation were identified (Table 1). Among these, Btg2 displayed a
>2-fold increase in expression in response to RA. Btg2 (Tis21, Pc3,
or APRO1) belongs to the antiproliferative (APRO) family and is
known to function in regulating the G1-S progression (30).
Correspondingly, decreased Btg2 expression has been linked to
cancerous states (31, 32). Expression of another BTG family
member that functions as a negative cell cycle regulator, transducer of ERBB2 (Tob1), was also induced (33).
Btg2 is a direct target for transcriptional activation by RAR.
To validate the array data, the effects of RA treatment on the
mRNA expression levels of Btg2 and the related Tob1 were
investigated. MCF-7 cells were treated with RA and lysed, and total
RNA was extracted. cDNA was generated, and mRNA levels of Btg2
and Tob1 were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using
Taqman probes. Data were normalized to 18S rRNA. In good
agreement with the Affymetrix array data, RA treatment increased
the level of Btg2 mRNA by close to 3-fold (Fig. 4A) and the level of
mRNA for Tob1 by 1.8-fold (mean of two experiments that differed
by 10%).
Regulation of expression of RA-responsive genes may be exerted
directly (i.e., mediated by a RARE). Alternatively, responses may
reflect secondary events involving RAR control of immediate target
genes, which, in turn, are involved in downstream events leading to
the observed modulation. Hence, an important question that arises
is whether Btg2 comprises a direct target for RAR. This question is
particularly pertinent considering the paucity of information on
the mechanisms by which RA exerts its anticarcinogenic activities.
To determine whether Btg2 is a direct target for RAR, the effect of
cycloheximide treatment on Btg2 level was examined. Cycloheximide inhibits protein synthesis and will thus abolish secondary
events that require de novo protein synthesis but will not affect
direct transcriptional responses. Cells were pretreated with

Figure 3. RA ‘‘pulse’’ is sufficient to trigger cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells.
MCF-7 cells were treated with vehicle or RA (1 Amol/L) for several hours or for
the entire duration of the experiment. Cells were incubated with BrdUrd, fixed,
stained with FITC-conjugated antibodies against BrdUrd and with propidium
iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry. A, cells were treated with RA for 3 h
(RA pulse ) or for 2 d (RA continuous ). B, cells were treated with RA for
5 h (RA pulse ) or for 4 d (RA continuous ). For continuous treatment, RA was
replenished after 48 h. C, RA-induced increases in the fraction of cells in the

evident after 2 days (Fig. 3A) and became more pronounced after
4 days (Fig. 3B). Hence, activation of initial targets of RA signaling
seems to be sufficient for triggering a subsequent cell cycle arrest
program in MCF-7 cells. Continuous treatment with RA resulted in
a somewhat more enhanced arrest response and in induction of
apoptosis, which became evident after day 4. It is worth noting,
however, that the cell cycle response to the pulsed treatment
seemed to be merely delayed rather than dampened (Fig. 3C). In
contrast, a short-term exposure to RA was not sufficient to elicit an
apoptotic response within the duration of the experiments.
RA up-regulates expression of cell cycle–regulating genes in
MCF-7 cells. To identify genes that may mediate the RA-induced
cell cycle arrest, an expression array analysis was done. MCF-7 cells

Btg2 Is a Direct Target for RAR

responsiveness of Btg2, a 4-kb stretch upstream of the transcription
start site of the gene was screened for potential RAREs (TransFac).1
Three DR2 half-sites were found to be present 3,250 bp upstream of
the start site (Fig. 5A). This element, along with flanking sequences
on both sides to a total of 95 bp, was generated and labeled with
32
P, and its ability to bind RXR-RAR heterodimers was examined by
electrophoretic mobility shift assays. RAR and RXR lacking their
NH2-terminal A/B domain (RARaDAB and RXRaDAB) were used.
The truncated proteins were used because of their greater yield
upon bacterial expression compared with their full-length counterparts. The ligand-binding, heterodimerization, and DNA-binding
properties of RARaDAB and RXRaDAB are indistinguishable from
those of the full-length receptors and are thus appropriate for the
assays. Proteins were bacterially expressed and purified and
incubated with the 95-bp oligonucleotide containing the Btg2
RARE. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by nondenaturing
PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 5B). Neither RAR nor
RXR alone efficiently shifted the mobility of oligonucleotide.
Addition of both receptors resulted in the appearance of a shifted
band, reflecting binding of the heterodimer to the element. The
observations that a cold probe containing the putative element
effectively competed for binding to the RXR-RAR heterodimer,
whereas the same 95-bp fragment mutated at the RARE did not,
further showed the specificity of the interactions.
To determine if the RAR/RXR heterodimer binds to the Btg2
RARE in cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were carried
out. Proteins were cross-linked to chromatin in MCF-7 cells,
sonicated, and immunoprecipitated using antibodies for RAR or
RXR. A 200-bp region flanking the Btg2 RARE was amplified by PCR
to detect receptor binding. The data (Fig. 5C) showed that
antibodies against either RAR or RXR precipitated the putative
Btg2 RARE, indicating that the element is occupied by the RXRRAR heterodimer in cells.
To examine the functionality of the putative RARE, the 95-bp
oligonucleotide containing the element was cloned upstream of a
luciferase reporter; the reporter was transfected into MCF-7 cells;
and transactivation assays were carried out. The data (Fig. 5D)
showed a dose-responsive activation of reporter expression by
RA, indicating that the element indeed comprises a functional
RARE. The magnitude of the effect was not very large, suggesting
that transcriptional regulation of Btg2 expression is likely to be
mediated by additional elements. Nevertheless, RA responsiveness and the observations that mutation of the RARE abolished
the response (Fig. 5E) further attest to its functionality and
specificity.

with cycloheximide (CHX ; 20 Ag/mL) for 10 min, followed by addition of RA
(50 nmol/L). Cells were incubated for 30 min, total RNA was extracted, and Btg2
mRNA level was measured by quantitative real-time PCR and normalized to

mRNA was extracted, and caspase-7 mRNA was measured by quantitative
real-time PCR and normalized to 18S rRNA. C, MCF-7 cells were transfected
with either an empty vector or a vector encoding CRABP-II. Cells were treated
with vehicle or RA (50 nmol/L) for 4 h, total RNA was extracted, and Btg2 mRNA
was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Data were normalized to 18S

cycloheximide and then treated with RA (50 nmol/L, 4 h), and Btg2
mRNA expression levels were determined (Fig. 4A). As a control, we
examined the effect of cycloheximide on the ability of RA to upregulate the expression of caspase-7, a gene that has been
previously shown to be an indirect target for RAR (Fig. 4B;
ref. 11). The analysis showed that whereas up-regulation of the
indirect target caspase-7 was abolished upon cycloheximide
treatment, inhibition of protein synthesis did not hinder the ability
of RA to enhance the expression of Btg2. Hence, the observations
show that Btg2 is a direct target for RAR.
CRABP II augments RA-induced up-regulation of Btg2. We
previously showed that the RA-binding protein CRABP-II directly
delivers RA from the cytosol to RAR in the nucleus, thereby
enhancing the transcriptional activity of the receptor (10, 11). As
the data showed that Btg2 is a direct target for RAR signaling, it
was of interest to examine whether up-regulation of its expression
in response for RA is augmented by CRABP-II. To this end, MCF-7
cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding CRABP-II
and treated with vehicle or RA. Measurements of the levels of Btg2
mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 4C) showed that ectopic
overexpression of CRABP-II significantly enhanced the RA-induced
up-regulation of the expression of the gene. Notably, CRABP-II
overexpression alone did not increase the expression of Btg2,
indicating that CRABP II does not regulate Btg2 expression
independently of RA.
A functional RARE is present in the promoter of Btg2.
Consensus RAREs consist of two direct hexameric repeats of the
sequence PuG(G/T)TCA spaced by either 2 or 5 bp (DR2 and DR5).

Discussion
RA displays pronounced anticarcinogenic activities in several
types of cancer, but the exact mechanisms that underlie these
activities remain incompletely understood. Previous reports
(11, 26, 27) and the data presented here indicate that RA-induced
growth inhibition of mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells comprises
a two-phase process, entailing an early cell cycle arrest followed
by induction of apoptosis. The present work aimed to obtain
insights into the initial cell cycle response. We show that 1 to 3 days
of RA treatment results in a decrease in cyclin D1 levels and in a
cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase (Fig. 1). The data further show that

second process displaying a high K m and a low V max. Alternatively,
the behavior may reflect the existence of two intracellular RA pools;
for example, free and protein-bound RA may degrade at different
rates. Such a behavior has been reported for a number of substrates
as exemplified by the observations that free retinol can be esterified
by acyl-CoA/retinol acyltransferase and by lecithin/retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), whereas retinol bound to cellular retinol
binding protein is recognized solely by LRAT (37–39). Our
observations that reducing the expression level of CRABP-II in
MCF-7 cells did not affect the rate of degradation of RA suggest
that this binding protein is not involved in regulating the
catabolism of its ligand, but it is possible that the CRABP-II
homologue CRABP-I, which is also expressed in MCF-7 cells (10),
serves in such a capacity.
The expression of several genes involved in cell cycle regulation
was found to be up-regulated following a 4-h treatment of MCF-7
cells with RA (Table 1). Of particular interest are the observations
that RA induces the expression of Btg2, a member of the
antiproliferative (APRO) family. Btg2, which was originally identified as an immediate-early gene induced by nerve growth factor in
PC12 cells (40, 41), is involved in regulation of cell growth and
differentiation. It was thus reported that Btg2 is a direct target
for the tumor suppressor p53 (42–44); that it is induced in response
to DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner (44, 45); that it triggers
cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the G1-S transition; and that this effect
is exerted by decreasing the expression of cyclin D1 (30, 46, 47).
Recent observations showed that, similarly to its activities in PC12
and NIH3T3 cells, overexpression of Btg2 in MCF-7 cells downregulates the expression of cyclin D1 and inhibits cell growth (48).
It was also recently shown that Btg2 plays a key role in mediating
the ability of p53 to suppress Ras-induced transformation of mouse
and human fibroblasts (43). In accordance with an antiproliferative
function, the expression of Btg2 is reduced or lost in various
carcinoma cells and human cancers, including prostate, breast,
kidney, and stomach cancers (31, 32, 43, 46). Although the
mechanisms by which Btg2 exerts its antiproliferative activities are
incompletely understood, it has been suggested that it modulates
transcriptional activities, and that it does so by interacting with
transcriptional coactivators or corepressors. It was thus reported
that Btg2 enhances the activity of protein-arginine methyltransferase 1; that it associates with homeobox b9 and carbon carbonylate
repressor 4–associated factor 1; and that it may interact with the
estrogen receptor a (49–52).
We show here that Btg2 comprises a direct target for RAinduced, RAR-mediated, transcriptional signaling. In support of
this conclusion, the data show that RA induces the expression of
Btg2, and that the induction does not require de novo protein
synthesis (Fig. 4). Additional observations show that an element
containing three RARE half-sites is present 3,250 bp upstream of
the Btg2 start site, and that this element specifically binds RXRRAR heterodimers in vitro, is occupied by the heterodimers in
MCF-7 cells, and can drive RA-induced transcriptional activation
of a luciferase reporter (Fig. 5). In view of the previous report that
Btg2 induces cell cycle arrest by down-regulating the expression
of cyclin D1 (23), the observations that RA treatment markedly
decreased cyclin D1 expression (Fig. 1B), further suggest that Btg2
plays an important role in mediating the antiproliferative
activities of RA in MCF-7 cells. Taken together, the observations
show that RA induces a G0-G1 arrest in MCF-7 cells by upregulating the expression of several genes involved in cell cycle
control, and that a short-term treatment with RA is sufficient to

Figure 5. A functional RARE in the Btg2 promoter. A, sequence of the Btg2
promoter at 3,357 to 3,142 bp. Putative RAREs in the wild-type promoter (WT )
are boldfaced and underlined. Mutated elements in mutant oligonucleotides are
underlined. B, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out using
bacterially expressed RARaDAB (100 nmol/L), RXRaDAB (100 nmol/L), and an
oligonucleotide containing the putative RARE (A , 1 ng). Competition assays used
increasing amounts of cold wild-type or mutated (mut ) oligonucleotide (100, 200,
400, and 800 ng). C, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay of the Btg2 promoter.
PCR was done on materials immunoprecipitated with pan-RAR (RAR), RARa, or
RXRa antibodies to amplify the RARE-containing region of the Btg2 promoter
( 3447 to 3197). D and E, MCF-7 cells were transfected with a luciferase
reporter construct driven by the Btg2 RARE (D ) or the wild-type and mutant
RARE construct (E), and transactivation assays were carried out as described
under Materials and Methods. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SD.

a short-term RA treatment of MCF-7 cells is sufficient for triggering
the program that leads to growth inhibition several days later
(Fig. 3). These observations thus suggest that growth inhibition by
RA is mediated by induction of immediate RAR target genes, and
that the effect does not require the presence of the hormone
throughout the progression of the program. Notably, although a RA
pulse efficiently induced cell cycle arrest, it did not trigger the
apoptotic response observed in cells that were continuously treated
with RA for 4 days (Fig. 3).
It has been reported that the half-life for degradation of RA in F9
teratocarcinoma cells and in the kidney cell line LLC-PK1 is 3.5 and
2.3 h, respectively (34, 35). In MCF-7 cells, RA degradation seems to
be comprised of a two-phase process, displaying half-lives of 13 and
84 min, respectively (Fig. 2; mean of two experiments). These rates
are faster than those reported for other cell lines, but it should be
noted that in MCF-7 cells, expression of CYP26a, an enzyme that
specifically catalyzes RA metabolism (36), increases by f18-fold
following a 4-h RA treatment (11). The rapid rates of RA
degradation observed here may thus reflect the dramatic upregulation of CYP26 resulting from the pretreatment of the cells
with RA.
The two-phase process by which RA is degraded in MCF-7 cells
may reflect the existence of two parallel degradation processes: a
rapid process characterized by a low K m and a high V max and a

these cells is mediated, at least in part, by induction of Btg2
expression.
