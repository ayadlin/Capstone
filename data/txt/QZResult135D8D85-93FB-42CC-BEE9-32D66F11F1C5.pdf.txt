ABSTRACT:
Molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors are promising targeted
cancer therapeutic drugs, with the advantage that they deplete multiple oncogenic
client proteins and modulate all the classical hallmarks of cancer. They are now in
clinical trial and show potential for activity in melanoma and other malignancies. Here
we explore the metabolic response to Hsp90 inhibition in human melanoma cells
using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We show that, concomitant with growth
inhibition and re-differentiation, Hsp90 inhibition in human melanoma cells is
associated with increased glycerophosphocholine content. This was seen with both
the clinical geldanamycin-based Hsp90 drug 17-AAG and the structurally dissimilar
Hsp90 inhibitor CCT018159. The effect was noted in both BRAF mutant SKMEL28 and
BRAF wildtype CHL-1 melanoma cells. Elevated content of the -CH2+CH3 fatty acyl
chains and cytoplasmic mobile lipid droplets was also observed in 17-AAG-treated
SKMEL28 cells. Importantly, the phospholipase A2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone
prevented the rise in glycerophosphocholine seen with 17-AAG, suggesting a role for
phospholipase A2 activation in the Hsp90 inhibitor-induced metabolic response. Our
findings provide a basis for using metabolic changes as non-invasive indicators of
Hsp90 inhibition and potentially as biomarkers of anticancer activity with Hsp90
drugs in malignant melanoma and possibly in other cancers.

modulation and some signs of biological activity
(stable disease) in melanoma patients that may
potentially be associated with the presence of BRAF
or NRAS mutation [17, 22]. Interestingly, mutant
BRAF, which is present in almost 70% of all
melanomas, shows marked dependency on Hsp90 and
is degraded by 17-AAG treatment, while WT BRAF
activated by NRAS is also Hsp90 dependent [20].
Furthermore, melanoma cells, regardless of their
BRAF or NRAS mutation status, are sensitive to the
growth inhibitory effects of 17-AAG (21), consistent
with the action of Hsp90 inhibitors on multiple
oncoproteins, including CRAF. A recent phase II
clinical study reported a lack of activity of 17-AAG in
melanoma which may be attributed to the treatment
dose and schedule not achieving sustained depletion of
BRAF/CRAF kinases [23]. The authors recommended
that future trials in melanoma should focus on more
potent Hsp90 inhibitors or a 17-AAG formulation that
can be administered chronically for a more prolonged
suppression of the extracellular signal-regulated
kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) mitogen activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway.
In this study, we wished to study in more depth the
effects of Hsp90 inhibitors in human melanoma cells,
and in particular to explore the effects of Hsp90
inhibition on cell metabolism, which may potentially
provide a means for further characterizing the
anticancer activity of these agents in the clinical
setting.
Membrane phospholipid metabolism is tightly
linked to cell proliferation and survival [24, 25] and is
altered with malignancy and following anticancer
treatment [9, 26]. In melanoma, choline-containing
derivatives of phospholipid metabolism show distinct
profiles during growth inhibition by chemotherapy
versus subsequent adaption to treatment [27]. This
suggests that phospholipid metabolism may be a
mediator of cell response/adaptation to treatment [27].
Using MRS, we have previously shown that
inhibition of Hsp90 with 17-AAG in human colon
carcinoma cells correlated with alterations in
phospholipid metabolism; an elevation in PC and GPC
levels in vitro, and PC+PE levels in vivo [28]. In other
studies, however, 17-AAG treatment caused a decline
in total choline levels (comprised of choline, PC and
GPC) in prostate cancer xenografts [29] and the rates
of radiolabelled-choline uptake and phosphorylation in
human colon cancer cells which would be expected to
produce a decrease in cellular PC [30]. The basis for
these apparent discrepancies is unclear but could relate

non-invasive methodology for studying a wide array of
cellular metabolites. MRS studies have shown
increases in levels of membrane phospholipid
metabolism intermediates including phosphocholine
(PC),
phosphoethanolamine
(PE),
glycerophosphocholine
(GPC)
and
glycerophosphoethanolamine
(GPE)
in
cancer
compared to normal tissues [4, 5]. These changes were
recorded in cells, animal models and patients,
suggesting their value as potential markers of
malignant disease and response to therapy [4, 6].
It is now widely accepted that these metabolic
alterations occur as a result of the modulation of
enzymes mediating phospholipid turnover, such as
phospholipases A, C and D (catabolic pathway) and
choline kinase and choline transport into cells (anabolic
pathway) which have all been reported to be altered in
malignancy as a result of oncoprotein activation [7, 8].
Furthermore, inhibition of oncogenic signaling by
molecularly targeted anticancer agents produces
changes in cellular phospholipid metabolism that are
consistent with the induced molecular and cellular
effects of the therapy (reviewed in ref [9]). Therefore,
probing the metabolic effects of treatment with targeted
agents should not only help to characterize the
interactions between oncogenic signaling and tumor
cell metabolism, but also provide a potential tool for
monitoring the action of molecularly targeted drugs.
Among the many targeted agents designed to block
the activity of oncogenic proteins, inhibitors of the heat
shock protein 90 (Hsp90) molecular chaperone are of
special interest. These agents cause the simultaneous
depletion of many oncogenic chaperone ‘client’
proteins, thus leading to the parallel blockade of
several oncogenic pathways and multiple key cancer
cell functions including proliferation, invasion and
angiogenesis [10-12]. Several Hsp90 inhibitors have
been identified, including the benzoquinone ansamycin
derivative 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin
(17-AAG, tanespimicin), as well as the prototype of the
pyrazole/isoxazole resorcinol class CCT018159 which
is a precursor of the resorcinylic isoxazole amide
clinical candidate NVP-AUY922 [13-16].
17-AAG has shown promising antitumor activity in
numerous preclinical models, and is currently
undergoing clinical testing with evidence of activity in
trastuzumab-refractory breast cancer [17-19]. In
addition, preclinical studies indicated that 17-AAG has
therapeutic activity against melanoma cells, most likely
via effects on the RAF family of oncoproteins [20, 21].
Early clinical studies revealed evidence of Hsp90 target

The level of client protein expression following Hsp90
inhibition was assessed by Western blotting as
previously described [32]. The primary antibodies used
were anti-Hsp70 (Stressgen Bioreargents; Michigan,
USA), anti-CRAF, anti-BRAF, anti-CDK4 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti- total and
phosphorylated cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2,
Cell Signalling Technology; Danvers, MA, USA), antityrosinase and anti-gp100 (Abcam; Cambridge, UK)
and anti-GAPDH (Chemicon; Hampshire, UK)
antibodies. The secondary antibodies used were antimouse for BRAF, Hsp70 and GAPDH and anti-rabbit
for CRAF, CDK4, cPLA2, phospho-cPLA2, tyrosinase
and gp100 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences;

to variations in the genetic profiles and drivers of the
various cancer cell lines studied or to differing
downstream cellular effects of the therapy, such as
differentiation or inhibition of growth versus induction
of apoptosis [13. 31].
Here we explore the metabolic consequences of
Hsp90 inhibition in human melanoma cells. Our aims
were to characterize any metabolic changes in relation
to the cellular and molecular effects induced postHsp90 inhibition, and to explore the mechanistic basis
that could give rise to them. Our findings show that
inhibition of Hsp90 in human melanoma cells with 17AAG and CCT018159 is associated with reduced
proliferation and induction of cell differentiation.
These effects correlated with an elevation in cellular
GPC and cytoplasmic lipid droplets which may be
associated with activation of calcium-independent
phospholipase A2 (iPLA2).

Analysis of Cell Morphology
Bright field images of control and treated cells were
acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert inverted light microscope
(Carl Zeiss Ltd.; Hertfordshire, UK) connected to a
Cool SNAP Pro Color digital camera (Media
Cybernetics; Bethesda, MD, USA), and cells visualized
using Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics)
version 6.2.0424.

MATERIALS & METHODS
Cell Culture
Human malignant melanoma SKMEL28 cells
(with V600E mutant BRAF, WT NRAS) were
obtained from ATCC, and CHL-1 cells (with WT
BRAF, WT NRAS) were a gift from Prof Richard
Marais (Institute of Cancer Research, London). Both
cell lines were cultivated in DMEM containing 10%
(v/v) heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml
penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin (Life
Technologies; Paisley, UK) and monthly screened for
mycoplasma.

Cell treatment and extraction for MRS analyses
Logarithmically growing SKMEL28 and CHL-1
cells were treated with 100 nM or 39 nM 17-AAG
respectively for 48h to achieve modulation of Hsp90
client proteins and a ca. 50% reduction in cell counts.
SKMEL28 cells were further treated with 15 μM
CCT018159 for 48h. Control cells were exposed to
DMSO at a concentration of 0.1%. In subsequent
experiments, 17-AAG treated cells were co-incubated
with 20 μM of the calcium-independent phospholipase
A2 (iPLA2) specific inhibitor bromoenol lactone (BEL,
Sigma-Aldrich) for the last 24h of treatment.

Analysis of cell growth inhibition, cell volume and
cell cycle profiles
Cell counts and diameter measurements were
performed on a Beckman Coulter Vi-Cell Cell
Viability Analyzer. The impact of the Hsp90 inhibitors
17-AAG (Alexis; Exeter, UK) and CCT018159
(Calbiochem; Nottingham, UK) on cell proliferation
was assessed using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay
following a 144h exposure to a range of drug
concentrations as previously described [32]. The effect
of Hsp90 inhibition on cell cycle profiles was assessed
by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining and
standard procedures as previously described [32].

At the end of each experiment cells were washed in
cold saline and extracted in equal volumes of cold
methanol, chloroform and water. Lyophilised samples
of the water-soluble phase were reconstituted in 540 l
of a D2O solution containing 0.075% (w/v) 3(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid as internal
reference for analysis by 1H MRS. Following
acquisition of 1H spectra, the sample volume was
topped up to 600 l with a D2O solution containing
EDTA and methylenediphosphonic acid (internal
standard) to a final concentration of 10 mM and 0.43

The lipid fraction of cell extracts was reconstituted in

RESULTS
Hsp90 inhibition induces growth arrest and
differentiation concomitant with depletion of
oncogenic client proteins

MR Spectroscopy Measurements

SRB assay of growth inhibition following treatment
with 17-AAG indicated that the drug reduced cell
proliferation in the two human melanoma cell lines
studied, with GI50 values of 21±5 nM for the BRAF
mutant SKMEL28 cells and 13±2 nM for the BRAF
WT CHL-1 cells. Thus 17-AAG has broadly similar
potency in the two melanoma cell lines. This is in
agreement with findings from previous studies in larger
melanoma cell line panels showing no dependence of
sensitivity to 17-AAG on BRAF mutation status [20,
21].
Western blotting demonstrated the expected
molecular signature of Hsp90 inhibition in both
melanoma cell lines as shown by depletion of the client
proteins CRAF, BRAF and CDK4 and induction of
Hsp70 following exposure to 17-AAG, thus confirming
inhibition of Hsp90 under the conditions used in our
experiments (Figure 1A, top panel). To confirm that
the effects were not restricted to one chemotype, the
resorcinylic pyrazole Hsp90 inhibitor CCT018159 [16,
33] also inhibited growth in SKMEL28 cells with a
GI50 value of 3.4±1.3 μM and induced similar
molecular effects as 17-AAG in this melanoma line
(Figure 1A).
Of interest, inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in
induction of differentiation in the melanoma lines used,
as shown by the characteristic increase in the dendritic
cell morphology and expression of the melanocyte
lineage marker tyrosinase in both CHL-1 and
SKMEL28 cells (Figure 1A, lower panel and B). The
levels of gp100, another melanoma differentiation
marker, were undetectable in CHL-1 cells but
significantly induced post-17-AAG treatment in
SKMEL28 cells. Basal phospho-ERK1/2 levels were
much lower in CHL-1 compared to SKMEL28 cells
but decreased substantially post-exposure to 17-AAG
in both cell lines and to CCT018159 in SKMEL28 cells
(Figure 1A lower panel) consistent with reduced
ERK1/2 MAPK signaling post Hsp90 inhibition.
As shown in Figure 1C, flow cytometry analysis of
cell cycle profiles indicated that at the concentrations
and treatment durations used, 17-AAG caused an
increase in the G1 cell phase of the cell cycle and a
corresponding reduction in the S phase population in

applying a 1Hz line broadening for 31P spectra.
Metabolite content was determined by peak integration,
normalized relative to the internal standard and
corrected for cell number and volume and for
saturation in the case of the 31P MR spectra.
Mobile lipid staining and confocal microscopy
For the detection of neutral mobile lipids,
SKMEL28 cells were grown on glass coverslips in
four-well plates and treated with vehicle or 17-AAG as
indicated above. At the end of the incubation, cells
were washed in PBS then fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde followed by incubation in a 1μg/ml
solution of Nile red (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15min. Cells
were then washed three times in a PBS solution
containing the nuclear stain Topro-3 (Molecular
Probes; Paisley, UK), then mounted on a slide.
Fluorescent images were acquired on a Leica SP1
confocal laser scanning microscope using 488 nm and
633 nm excitation, and 530 nm and 670-720 nm
emission wavelengths for Nile red and Topro-3
respectively. Cells were visualized using the Leica
Confocal software version 2.61. Quantitation of the
number of lipid droplets per cell was performed using
ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA) version
1.42q and analysis of a minimum of 15 cells per image.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical significance of the results was
assessed using an unpaired 2-tailed Student t-test with
p values ≤ 0.05 considered to be significant. Data are
represented as the mean  standard deviation.

H MRS analysis indicated that the most prominent
and consistent effect observed following 17-AAG
treatment was a rise in GPC levels of up to 2.5-fold in
SKMEL28 and CHL-1 cells (Figure 2A and B). PC
levels remained unchanged in both cell lines (p0.35).
Consequently, the PC/GPC ratio decreased by half in
both SKMEL28 and CHL-1 cells (Figure 2C). Similar
effects were also recorded by 31P MRS as summarized
in Table 1.

metabolism following Hsp90 inhibition, we analyzed
the 1H and 31P MR spectra of the aqueous metabolites

cells exhibited similar metabolic profiles to those
seen with 17-AAG when exposed to the alternative
chemotype Hsp90 inhibitor CCT018159, with the GPC
content increasing to 240±65% relative to the controls
(n=5, p=0.008). There was a trend towards an increase
in PC content (152±46%) although this did not reach
statistical significance (p=0.067). The PC/GPC ratio
was reduced to 67±23% relative to vehicle treated
controls (p=0.03).

SKMEL28 cells following exposure to the 17-AAG.
Analysis by confocal microscopy revealed an increase
in the staining originating from cytoplasmic mobile
lipid droplets following treatment with 17-AAG
compared to vehicle treated control cells (Figure 4A).
Quantitation showed an increase in the number of lipid
droplets by ~6.5-fold compared to the control (n=3,
p=0.033). This result corroborates the 1H MRSobserved increase in fatty acyl chain signals post 17AAG treatment and indicates that these are likely to be
present within cytoplasmic mobile lipid stores.

Hsp90 inhibition correlates with increased fatty
acid signals and cytoplasmic lipid droplets

The metabolic effects of Hsp90 inhibition may be
associated
with
calcium-independent
PLA2
activation

GPC is formed following the breakdown of the
membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho)
via PLA2 and subsequently via lysophospholipase,
leading to simultaneous release of free fatty acids (25).
To investigate the basis for the rise in GPC, we
analyzed the lipid metabolites of 17-AAG-treated
SKMEL28 cells by 1H MRS. This revealed no
differences in the levels of PtdCho (104±13%; n=7,
p=0.4) but the levels of the -CH2 free fatty acyl chains
increased reproducibly by 1.35-fold relative to the
control (p=0.02). The content of the –CH3 chains and
the poly-unsaturated fatty acid signals at 5.3 ppm was
also increased by 1.65-and 1.3-fold respectively,
although this did not reach statistical significance (n=7,
p=0.07 and p=0.14 respectively). The ratio of –
(CH3+CH2)/PtdCho increased by 1.35-fold relative to
the control (p=0.0055) (Figure 3A and B).
To further characterize the changes in lipids
observed by MRS, we performed Nile red staining on

The increase in GPC coupled with the rise in
mobile lipids induced by 17-AAG pointed to activation
of PLA2 following Hsp90 inhibition. To confirm this,
we assessed the effect of 17-AAG on the level of
expression and activation (by phosphorylation) of
cytosolic calcium-dependent PLA2 (cPLA2), a widely
studied and well characterized member of the PLA2
family (34). Interestingly, Western blotting showed a
reduction in the expression of cPLA2 together with a
marked decline in the levels of phospho-cPLA2 in
SKMEL28 cells following exposure to 17-AAG,
indicating reduced activity of the enzyme (Figure 5A).
Therefore, it is unlikely that the metabolic changes
observed following treatment with 17-AAG could be
related to cPLA2 activation.
We next tested the involvement of cytosolic

In this study we evaluate the metabolic
consequences that follow inhibition of Hsp90, a
molecular chaperone involved in maintaining the
stability, conformation and activatable state of several
oncogenic proteins involved in the initiation and
maintenance of the malignant phenotype [10-12]. We
used the clinical Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG and the
prototype resorcinylic pyrazole CCT018159 Hsp90
inhibitor in human melanoma cells to study the effects
of inhibition of the molecular chaperone on
phospholipid metabolism, and to explore the cellular
and biochemical processes that give rise to them.
Two human melanoma cell lines were used: CHL-1
with WT BRAF/WT NRAS and SKMEL28 with
V600E mutant BRAF/WT NRAS. We selected these
lines because mutant BRAF is highly sensitive to
Hsp90 inhibition although melanoma cells regardless
of their BRAF status are also growth inhibited by
agents such as 17-AAG, most likely because of
depletion of CRAF as well as BRAF, in addition to
effects on other client proteins [20, 21].
Growth inhibition assays on SKMEL28 and CHL-1
cells showed no major differences in the potency of 17AAG between the two cell lines, consistent with
previous studies in larger panels showing that mutant
BRAF is not a predictive marker for sensitivity to
Hsp90 inhibitors in human melanoma cell lines [20,
21].
Further assays were conducted to determine the
time and drug concentration required to achieve the
characteristic molecular signature of Hsp90 inhibition
(reduction in CRAF, BRAF and CDK4 as
representative client proteins together with induction of
Hsp70) as well as to cause a decrease in cell counts to
~50% of controls. Interestingly, inhibition of Hsp90
with both 17-AAG and CCT018159 was associated
with induction of cell differentiation as indicated by the
increased expression of the melanocyte lineage
markers tyrosinase and gp100 (involved in melanin
synthesis and deposition) and the increase in the
dendritic cell morphology [36]. These observations are
in agreement with the previously reported effects of
Hsp90 inhibition on cell differentiation status in human
breast cancer cells [31].
We next examined the metabolic features
characteristic of cells exhibiting the molecular and
cellular effects of Hsp90 blockade. 1H and 31P MR
analyses of extracts from SKMEL28 and CHL-1 cells
indicated that 17-AAG treatment resulted in an
increase in cellular levels of GPC in the two cell lines
while PC levels remained unchanged. The PC/GPC

calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2), another key
regulator of membrane lipid metabolism [34], and
assessed whether the effect on GPC could be reversed
by co-treatment with the iPLA2 specific inhibitor BEL
[34].
Western blotting showed that the levels of Hsp90
client protein depletion and differentiation marker
induction were comparable in melanoma cells treated
with 17-AAG+BEL versus 17-AAG alone (data not
shown). In addition, cell counts per flask relative to
the control were also similar (40±6% for 17-AAG and
34±14% for 17-AAG+BEL, p=0.46). MRS analysis
indicated that, as shown in Figure 5B, co-incubation of
SKMEL28 melanoma cells with 17AAG+BEL
prevented the rise in GPC seen with 17-AAG alone
(n=4, p=0.01). PC levels showed a slight increase in
17-AAG+BEL treated melanoma cells compared to
cells treated with 17-AAG alone although this effect
was not statistically significant (p=0.076). No
significant alterations were noted in the levels of GPE
or NTP in cells treated with 17-AAG+BEL versus 17AAG on its own (p0.37, Figure 5B).
These observations suggest that the rise in GPC
recorded with 17-AAG may be related to iPLA2
activation following Hsp90 inhibition.
DISCUSSION
Studies using MRS have shown characteristic
changes in choline phospholipid metabolism in tumor
versus normal tissues, which extend from cell and
animal models to humans. In particular, increases in
levels of PC and the PC/GPC ratio have been reported
to occur with increased malignant potential [7, 26].
This ‘metabolic signature’ has been linked to changes
in enzyme activities governing the rate of choline
transport and phosphorylation (e.g. choline kinase) as
well as membrane phospholipid breakdown (PLA, C
and D) which occur following oncogene activation and
the acquisition of a malignant phenotype [7, 8, 35]. In a
melanoma model, alterations in the phospholipid
metabolic phenotype were observed during initial
response to chemotherapy versus subsequent
adaptation of tumors to treatment. Specifically during
the growth inhibition phase, a rise in levels of PC+PE
and GPC+GPE was recorded while the re-growth phase
was characterized by an increase in PC+PE only. It is
therefore plausible that changes in tumor phospholipid
profiles could be implicated in tumor survival and
adaptation to therapy [27].

ratio was also reduced in both cell lines. Similar
changes in GPC and PC/GPC were also obtained with
the more recently developed and structurally dissimilar
Hsp90 inhibitor CCT018159 in SKMEL28 melanoma
cells. Demonstration of the same effects with two
different Hsp90 inhibitor chemotypes provides further
support for a mechanism involving pharmacologic
modulation of the molecular chaperone. This metabolic
signature correlated with inhibition of Hsp90 and
downstream growth arrest and induction of
differentiation in both melanoma cell lines used here,
suggesting that it is likely to be BRAF statusindependent.
Membrane phospholipid metabolism is regulated by
several processes including the cell cycle, with net
phospholipid accumulation observed during S phase
[24]. In our experiments, Hsp90 inhibition caused a
G1/S cell cycle arrest in SKMEL28 cells, while the
effects in CHL-1 cells were not statistically significant;
GPC, however, increased in both cases. Therefore it is
unlikely that the rise in GPC observed post Hsp90
inhibitor treatment is related to an arrest in a particular
phase of the cell cycle.
Previous work has shown increased GPC in cells
exposed to apoptosis inducing agents [37]. Although
Hsp90 inhibitors are mainly cytostatic, they can in
some cases induce apoptosis, albeit to a limited extent
due to the anti-apoptotic effects of induced heat shock
proteins, such as Hsp72 and Hsc70 [12, 16, 38]. Our
measurements were performed on adherent cells which
were largely non-apoptotic as shown by flow
cytometry (Figure 1C). Therefore it is unlikely that the
changes reported here could be linked to overt
apoptosis, although we cannot rule out the involvement
of early processes leading up to apoptosis.
The decline in the PC/GPC ratio observed in every
case is consistent with reduced malignant potential [26,
35] following treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors and
indicates a degree of normalization in cellular
phospholipid metabolism post-therapy.
As indicated above, GPC is produced following the
hydrolysis of PtdCho via PLA2 and subsequently
lysophospholipase, which results in simultaneous
release of free fatty acids [25]. To explore the
mechanistic basis for the rise in GPC detected here, we
assessed the levels of free fatty acid chains post Hsp90
inhibition. 1H MRS analysis showed an increase in the
–CH2+CH3 fatty acyl groups in 17-AAG-treated
SKMEL28 cells concomitant with the accumulation in
GPC. To better characterize the origin of these lipids,
Nile red staining was performed. This showed that 17-

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

AAG treatment resulted in an increase in the signals
originating from cytoplasmic mobile lipid droplets,
which are believed to contain the –CH2+CH3 fatty acyl
chains detectable by MRS [39, 40]. Taken together
these data support the involvement of a phospholipase
A2 activity in the metabolic alterations observed
following Hsp90 inhibition.
The PLA2 superfamily consists of many members,
of which three main types are distinguishable: the
cytosolic calcium-dependent (cPLA2), cytosolic
calcium-independent (iPLA2), and the secreted
(sPLA2) PLA2 [34]. To determine the particular
isoform involved in the observed metabolic changes,
we initially investigated the expression and status of
activation (by phosphorylation) of the widely reported
and well characterized cPLA2 using Western blotting.
This analysis indicated that the levels of cPLA2 and
phospho-cPLA2 (the active form) were markedly
reduced upon exposure to 17-AAG (an effect that to
our knowledge has not been previously reported).
Therefore it is unlikely that this enzyme could be
involved in the increased generation of GPC observed
here. This result was not surprising since a previous
study showed that cPLA2 is activated by mitogenic
signaling (which, at least for ERK1/2, is inhibited by
17-AAG in this study) leading to arachidonic acid
mobilization, necessary for the inflammatory response
[41], in line with the reported anti-inflammatory effects
of Hsp90 inhibition [42].
On the other hand, iPLA2 has been implicated in
phospholipid remodeling and in GPC release to
maintain cellular lipid homeostasis [43]. Due to the
lack of good commercially available antibodies for
iPLA2 (and sPLA2), we could not evaluate the
expression of these enzymes following exposure to 17AAG. Therefore, to assess if iPLA2 could be
implicated in the rise in GPC, 17-AAG-treated
SKMEL28 cells were co-incubated with BEL, a
specific inhibitor of iPLA2 that has no activity against
the other cellular PLA2s including cPLA2 and sPLA2
[34]. Our results show that BEL treatment preserved
the molecular response of Hsp90 inhibition without
further significant reduction of cell counts. More
importantly co-exposure to BEL prevented the
accumulation in GPC recorded with 17-AAG alone
with no significant effect on PC, GPE or NTP. This
finding indicates that the rise in GPC seen with Hsp90
inhibitors is likely to involve iPLA2 activation.
Despite the fact that BEL is specific for iPLA2 over
the other PLA2 sub-types, it also inhibits the
magnesium-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatase,

194

Oncotarget 2010; 1: 185-197

human melanoma cells. This is coupled with elevated
fatty acid signals and cytoplasmic mobile lipid droplet
content. The rise in GPC is reversed upon co-exposure
to the iPLA2 specific inhibitor BEL, indicating the
involvement of iPLA2 as a likely mechanism for the
increase in the levels of this metabolite. This metabolic
effect was concomitant with inhibition of oncogenic
signal transduction and cell proliferation, and induction
of differentiation in a manner that does not seem to be
dependent on BRAF mutational status or on the
particular cell cycle arrest profile induced in the
melanoma cell lines studied here.
These findings offer further insights into the
biochemical processes modulated by Hsp90 inhibition
in human melanoma cells, and provide a basis for
future studies investigating metabolic changes as
potential indicators of the anticancer activity exerted by
Hsp90 inhibitors in malignant melanoma.

the enzyme that converts phosphatic acid into
diacylglycerol, with similar potency [44]. However, as
this activity is not involved in the synthesis of GPC, it
is unlikely that the effects of BEL on GPC observed
here could be linked to inhibition of enzymes other
than iPLA2. We therefore conclude that activation of
iPLA2, but not cPLA2, may be implicated in the
accumulation of GPC content seen following Hsp90
inhibition. The observation that PtdCho levels were not
altered in 17-AAG-treated cells despite the presumed
up-regulation of iPLA2 activity is consistent with the
tight control of membrane PtdCho homeostasis and
implies the involvement of other rate limiting enzymes
in regulating this process.
The exact molecular mechanism via which Hsp90
inhibition impacts on iPLA2 activity needs further
investigation. One possibility may be through
phosphorylation of p38 MAPK occurring following
Hsp90 inhibition [45] which has been shown to
activate iPLA2 [46]. Future work will establish
whether such events could be responsible for the
changes observed in our study.
We have shown that the rise in GPC was the most
consistent change seen in SKMEL28 and CHL-1
melanoma cell lines, and was seen with both Hsp90
inhibitor chemotypes in SKMEL28 cells. This is in
agreement with results from our previous work with
17-AAG showing increased GPC levels in human
colon cancer cells [28]. However, and in contrast to our
earlier findings from that study, we did not observe a
significant effect on PC levels following Hsp90
inhibition in the human melanoma cell lines used here.
Moreover, an in vivo study on prostate cancer
xenografts has shown a reduction in total choline levels
(comprising choline, PC and GPC) following
administration of 17-AAG [29]; however, in that in
vivo study there was significant apparent tumor
heterogeneity following treatment with appearance of a
potentially necrotic core, which may have altered the
overall metabolite signature in vivo, and contributed to
partial volume effects. The metabolic response in the
absence of the tissue effects of treatment was not
reported. We have previously noted metabolic changes
in vivo that are proportional to the degree of volume
response and to vascular changes [47]. The apparent
discrepancy between the various results may indicate
cell line and context-dependence and further
investigation is required to define the basis for these
differences in metabolic effects.
In summary, our data show that Hsp90 inhibition
results in increased GPC and reduced PC/GPC in
