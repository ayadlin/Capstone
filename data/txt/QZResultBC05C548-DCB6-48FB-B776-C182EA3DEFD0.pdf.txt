ABSTRACT
Long-term exposure to arsenic, an environmental contaminant, leads to increased
risks of cancers. In the present study, we investigated the sequential regulation of
Elk-1 and Egr-1 on As3+-induced GADD45α, an effector of G2/M checkpoint. We found
that As3+ transcriptionally induced both Elk-1 and Egr-1, and NF-κB binding site
was necessary for As3+-induced Egr-1 promoter activity. However, specific inhibition
of JNK, ERK, and Elk-1 inhibited Egr-1 induction. Furthermore, silencing of Egr-1
downregulated As3+-induced expression of GADD45α and ChIP assay confirmed the
direct binding of Egr-1 to GADD45α promoter. Taken together, our data indicated
that the increase of GADD45α in response to As3+ was mediated sequentially by Elk1 and Egr-1.

INTRODUCTION

45α (GADD45α) is a regulator at G2/M checkpoint,
and plays roles in apoptosis, DNA damage response,
and cell cycle arrest. It is often upregulated in response
to various environmental stresses and drug therapies.
The repression or deletion of GADD45α results in
uncontrolled proliferation that is a survival mechanism
[6]. The impairment of GADD45α (GADD45α-null mice)
exhibits severe genomic instabilities, such as aneuploidy,
chromosomal aberrations, gene amplification, centrosome
amplification, abnormal mitosis and cytokinesis [7].
GADD45α interacts with proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) via competing with p21, which is a
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor [8], MEKK4 that is
an upstream of p38 and JNK pathways [9], histone core
proteins [10], and FOXO3a [11]. Post-transcriptional
regulation, including mRNA stabilization linked with
nucleolin [12] and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
[13], is another mechanism for the increase of GADD45α
expression.
Both Early growth response 1 (Egr-1) and
E-twenty-six (ETS)-like transcription factor 1 (Elk-1)
are transcription factors. Egr-1 (also known as NGFI-A,
zif 268, TIS8 and Krox-24) is rapidly and transiently
induced by growth factors, differentiation signals [14]

Inorganic arsenic has a paradoxical role in cancer.
Low-dose of arsenic is a treatment of some cancers like
acute promyelocytic leukemia [1], while high-level
of arsenic is a potential carcinogen, especially under
chronic exposure. The molecular mechanisms of neither
therapeutic effects nor carcinogenesis are fully understood.
No evidence has shown that arsenic causes point
mutations, however, the primary hypotheses explaining
carcinogenic effects of arsenic include impairment of
DNA repair, oncogene amplification, hypomethylation
of DNA [2]. Furthermore, arsenic has been linked to cell
growth and malignant transformation through sustained
oxidative stress and aberrant kinase activation, including
JNK, p38, checkpoint kinases, and Akt [3]. Arsenic has
two biological important oxidation states: arsenate (As5+)
and arsenite (As3+). As3+ is considerably more toxic than
As5+, since it tends to react as a soft metal with thiols [4].
Human exposures to arsenic are mainly due to industrial
activities such as the smelting process and coal burning,
pollution in drinking water, contaminated food or drugs,
and arsenic-containing dust [5].

and ionizing radiation [15]. As a transcription factor that
triggers transcription of multiple genes mediating cell
growth and angiogenesis, the downstream of Egr-1 has
been extensively studied. In lung cancer cell line A549,
the upregulation of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an antiangiogenic and anti-invasion protein, upon cyclooxygenase
(COX) inhibitors treatment is mediated by Egr-1 [16],
and Egr-1 directly binds and downregulates stathmin
expression which regulates the dynamics of microtubules
[17]. During UV radiation, Egr-1 activates phosphatase
and tensin (PTEN) homologue tumor suppressor [18].
Most of known Egr-1 targets are genes involved in tumor
metastasis, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1) [19], Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)
[20], and matrix metalloporteinase-9 (MMP-9) [21]. Elk1 belongs to ETS-domain family and is involved in the
regulation of cell growth, differentiation and survival. Its
activation requires phosphorylation from upstreams.
In this study, we determined the roles of Elk-1
and Egr-1 in As3+-induced GADD45α expression. Our
findings demonstrated that As3+ transcriptionally increased
Egr-1 expression via ERK and JNK pathway, not Akt or
p38 pathway, and the Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB)
binding site was necessary to promote As3+-mediated Egr1 transcriptional induction. However, As3+-induced Egr-1
expression and promoter activity were inhibited with Elk1 downregulation. Furthermore, Egr-1 regulated As3+induced GADD45α by direct binding to its promoter.

Induction of Egr-1 mRNA and Protein Expression
by As3+ in BEAS-2B Cells
Human bronchial epithelial airway cell line, BEAS2B, was selected to investigate the effect of As3+ because
lung is the major target of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis,
especially in occupational exposure. As3+ has already
been proven to induce GADD45α in a dose-dependent
manner [23]. Thus, we first needed to determine if As3+
would increase the expression of Egr-1 in BEAS-2B cells.
BEAS-2B cells were incubated with 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80
μM of As3+ for 4 h, and protein expression and mRNA
level were measured by real-time RT-PCR and western
blot, respectively (Fig. 1A and 1B). A dose-dependent
induction of Egr-1 expression by As3+ was seen, and 20 μM
was chosen for later studies since previous report showed
that exposure of BEAS-2B cells in a growing condition
to 20 μM of As3+ resulted in a time-dependent increase in
GADD45α mRNA and protein [13]. To examine whether
the induction of Egr-1 occurs in a time-dependent manner,
after treatment with 20 μM of As3+ at various time points,
the expression of Egr-1 protein expression and mRNA
level were measured. The induction of Egr-1 protein was
time-dependent, and lagged behind the induction of Egr-1
mRNA of which the peak induction happened at 1 h after
exposure (Fig. 1C). Egr-1 protein expression continued

for 4 h, and mRNA expression was measured by real-time RT-PCR. The fold inductions correspond to the ratio between controls untreated
and exposed cells (mean +/- SE). Egr-1 and β-actin protein expression were determined by western blot. (C and D) Cells were treated with

to increase at 1 to 4 h range, and was maintained until 8
h (Fig. 1D). These results confirm the increase of Egr-1
expression by As3+ in BEAS-2B cells.

The regulation of As3+-induced Egr-1 expression
by MAPK and Akt

Functional analysis of As3+-mediated Egr-1
promoter induction

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
cascade is considered to be a major signaling pathway that
links signals from the cell surface to the nuclear events
triggered by various stimuli [24], and there are three
types of mammalian MAP kinases: JNK, ERK, and p38
[25]. The PI3K/Akt pathway modulates the function of
a number of substrates involved in the regulation of cell
survival, cell cycle progression and cellular growth [26].
To identify the involvement of MAPK and Akt pathways
in As3+-mediated Egr-1 induction, BEAS-2B cells were
pretreated with 10 μM of p38 inhibitor (SB 203580), 20
μM of JNK inhibitor (SP 600125), 10 μM of ERK inhibitor
(U-0126), and 10 μM of PI3K inhibitor (LY 294002) for 1
h, respectively, followed by with or without 20 μM of As3+
treatment for 4 h. The Egr-1 expression was measured by
western blot. The data demonstrates that SP 600125 and
U-0126 blocked As3+-mediated Egr-1 induction in BEAS2B cells whereas SB 203580 and LY 294002 (Fig. 3) had
no effect.

The induction of Egr-1 mRNA by As3+ suggested a
relationship between As3+ -mediated Egr-1 induction and
an increase in gene transcription. To confirm that Egr-1 is
transcriptionally activated and to analyze the functional
binding sites, we isolated and cloned 1.4 kb of genomic
DNA located within Egr-1 5’ regulatory sequences (pEgr1-luc) which corresponds to the core promoter, plus the
5’ noncoding region of the Egr-1 mRNA into a luciferase
reporter gene and constructed multiple plasmids based on
pEgr-1-luc. F4 and F3 promoter fragments were created
by deleting 334 and 570 bp from the 5’ end of pEgr-1luc, respectively. The deletions of Δ1, Δ5, and Δ6 were
precisely located at position -447/-397, -447/-426, -426/397, respectively. A canonical NF-κB binding motif in
the region deleted in Δ6 was revealed by computational
sequence analysis, and thus we mutated this binding site
(MutNF-κB). All these promoters were transfected into
BEAS-2B cells that were then treated with or without 20
μM of As3+ overnight. The results showed a significant
increase in the transcription activity of pEgr-1-luc, F4 and
Δ5 constructs, while F3 remained unresponsive, and Δ6
and MutNF-κB partially abolished the Egr-1 promoter
response to As3+ (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that
NF-κB binding site located at -425/-417 is necessary
but not sufficient to promote As3+-mediated Egr-1
transcriptional induction.

Activation of Elk-1 by As3+
Elk-1 is in a transcriptionally active state when
phosphorylated by the MAPK cascade [27]. In this report,
we found that As3+ augmented Elk-1 phosphorylation in
a dose- and time-dependent way (Fig. 4A and 4B). Elk-1
phosphorylation reached maximal at 2 h, which was earlier
than the peak induction of Egr-1 protein. The promoter
activity of Elk-1 was also investigated. A GAL4-Elk-1
expression plasmid, which contains the NH2 terminal
147 amino acids of the yeast transcription factor GAL4

domain of Elk-1, was co-transfected into BEAS-2B cells
together with a report plasmid constructed with GAL4binding sequences (Fig. 4C). As shown in Fig. 4D, As3+
increased the trans-acting activity of GAL4-Elk-1 by
about 10 folds. These data propose the activation of Elk-1
by As3+.

pathway [29]. Thus, to confirm the relationship between
Elk-1 and Egr-1, we transfected BEAS-2B cells with
Elk-1 siRNA or shRNA followed by As3+ treatment.
The induction of Egr-1 protein expression by As3+ was
diminished along with the knockdown of Elk-1 (Fig.
5A), as well as the induction of Egr-1 promoter activity
which only expressed 10% luciferase compared to As3+
only control (Fig. 5B). The increase of Egr-1 mRNA by
As3+ was also blocked by Elk-1 shRNA. The basal Egr-1
mRNA level was not affected by Elk-1 shRNA, however,
1 h induction of Egr-1 mRNA by As3+ was reduced by
50% when transfected with Elk-1 shRNA, and after 1 h,
Egr-1 mRNA dropped back to basal level in Elk-1 shRNA
transfected cells (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that

The requirement of Elk-1 activation for As3+induced Egr-1 synthesis
As shown previously, there is a Elk-1 binding site
in Egr-1 promoter [28], and in C6 glioma cells, ERβactivated Egr-1 transcription is through ERK/Elk-1

Fig 3: ERK and JNK pathway is required for induction of Egr-1 by As3+. BEAS-2B cells were pretreated with 10 μM of SB
203580, LY 294002, U 0126, and 20 μM of SP 600125 for 1 h and then with or without arsenic for 4 h. Cells were isolated for protein
followed by western blot analysis for Egr-1 and β-actin.

As3+. To test whether Egr-1 is involved in the regulation
of As3+-induced GADD45α expression, we transiently
transfected cells with Egr-1 siRNA before As3+ treatment.
The suppression of Egr-1 by specific siRNA of Egr-1
blocked the induction of GADD45α protein expression
by As3+ (Fig. 6C). Therefore, Egr-1 is the upstream of
As3+-induced GADD45α. To further investigate whether
Egr--1 protein directly binds to GADD45α promoter,
we performed a Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
experiment on BEAS-2B cells treated with or without
20 μM of As3+. The detection of the GADD45α promoter
was performed by PCR analysis with specific primer pairs
located in the core promoter and the 5’ noncoding region.
Efficiency of the primer was tested on the genomic DNA
input. The results depicted significant amplification of

The contribution of Egr-1 to GADD45α expression
upon As3+ treatment
Egr-1 regulates GADD45α promoter activities by
direct binding to its endogenous regulatory sequence
upon UV irradiation in an immortal human keratinocyte
cell line (HaCaT) [22]. Given that the increase of
GADD45α protein expression occurred after 6 h exposure
to As3+ (Fig. 6A and B), which is later than that of Egr1 under similar condition, we considered GADD45α as
a target of Egr-1 in BEAS-2B cells when treated with

group (IgG) (Fig. 6D) no amplification was observed.
Taken together, our data indicate direct binding of Egr-1
protein to GADD45α promoter in BEAS-2B cells when
treated with As3+, thus confirming the role of Egr-1 in the
regulation of As3+-induced GADD45α expression.

in lung cancer [35]. Here, in our research, Egr-1 performs
as a tumor suppressor and leads to cell growth arrest and
apoptosis via ERK and JNK in arsenic treated BEAS-2B
cells.
Mutation of NF-κB binding site in Egr-1 promoter
totally eliminates UVB-mediated Egr-1 transcriptional
induction in epidermal cells, as well as Δ6 promoter [22].
However, our luciferase assay exhibits a partial inhibition
in As3+-mediated Egr-1 transcriptional induction.
An Elk-1 binding site was found by computational
sequence analysis in the deleted region near NF-κB
binding site, and the importance of Elk-1 binding site
has been pointed by many previous studies. Moreover,
the involvement of ERK in Egr-1 induction also implies
the role of Elk-1 binding site in Egr-1 transcriptional
activation. Lipopolysaccharide-induced Egr-1 activation
is regulated by Elk-1 phosphorylation through the
MEK/ERK signaling cascade [36], and it requires the
recruitment of SRF to SREs in the Egr-1 promoter (43
IGFBP). In prostate tumors, Egr-1 expression is frequently
upregulated, and Egr-1 expression in prostate cancer cells
PC3 is mediated through an EGF-ERK-Elk-1 signaling
cascade [37]. Hemin activates Elk-1 and NF-κB and
promotes their interaction with Egr-1 promoter [38]. In
this study, we confirmed the indispensability of Elk-1
activation in As3+-induced Egr-1 activity by showing that
Egr-1 activity is abolished when Elk-1 is downregulated.
GADD45α expression is normally low and is
activated in response to various stresses as a protective
mechanism in normal cells. High level of GADD45α
arrests cell cycle progression at G2/M checkpoint and
repairs DNA by nucleotide excision [39]. An 8% increase
in G2/M phase was observed when treated with 10 µM
of As3+ for 24 h in BEAS-2B cells (Data not shown),
suggesting the function of GADD45α in stress-insulted
normal cells. In addition, GADD45α expression is aberrant
in cancers [40-41], proposing that GADD45α could be
a potential therapeutic target. Therefore, knowing how
GADD45α is regulated is essential to design GADD45αtargeted treatment. Currently, we are also working at
GADD45α-targeted gene therapy, which showed its
effect in A549 cells (Unpublished data, Shi, Q). Besides
Egr-1, we also found that the rise of activating factor 3
(ATF3) expression by As3+ was later than that of Egr1, but earlier than that of GADD45α (data not shown),
implying a possible sequential activation of these three
proteins. Previous study showed that the expression of
ATF3 occurred via Egr-1 downstream of ERK1/2 [42]. It
is likely that As3+ could induce GADD45α via Egr-1/ATF3
pathway.
In conclusion, our study is the first time
demonstration of MAPK/Elk-1/Egr-1/GADD45α pathway
in normal bronchial cells. This sequential activation of
MAPK/Elk-1/Egr-1/GADD45α gives an explanation to
the carcinogenic effect of As3+ and also elucidates the
regulation of GADD45α during carcinogenesis.

DISCUSSION
As3+ likely acts as a tumor promoter rather than a
direct mutagen [30]. Similar to heat shock, sodium arsenite
activates Egr-1 via the JNK1 and p38 signal transduction
pathways in mouse embryo fibroblast cell line NIH3T3
[31], indicating As3+-induced stress at the molecular level
shares many features with the heat shock response, and
produces oxidative stress at least. In contrast, our data
shows that JNK and ERK, instead of p38, activate Egr-1
when treated with As3+. The retinoid 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid (AHPN),
a cell proliferation inhibitor and apoptosis inducer has
been shown to induce Egr-1 expression through ERK1/2
signaling pathway rather than activation of p38 in lung
cancer cells [32]. Egr-1 exhibits either oncogenic or tumor
suppressive properties depending on the type of cells
and stimuli. Blocking nuclear translocation of Egr-1 is
responsible for the loss of PTEN expression in gefitinibresistant lung cancer cells [33]. Egr-1 also mediates TNF-α
induction in bystander response in A549 cells, and plays
an essential role in eliciting bystander-mediated apoptotic
response in the same cell line [34]. Conversely, Egr-1,
which is induced by ERK pathway activation, induces and
enhances vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)

1/Egr-1/GADD45α pathway. Egr-1 directly binds GADD45α
promoter and increases the expression of GADD45α, which
results in subsequent biological events and finally arrests cell
cycle progression.
