BACKGROUND: Therapeutic options for patients with recurrent multiple myeloma after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)
include novel agents, conventional chemotherapy, or salvage ASCT with no standard of care. METHODS: A total of 200 patients with
multiple myeloma who developed disease recurrence after treatment with upfront ASCT and received an autologous retransplantation as salvage therapy at the study center over a period of 15 years were retrospectively reviewed. The objective of the current study
was to evaluate the role of salvage ASCT in terms of efficacy, particularly taking into account the impact of novel agents. RESULTS:
The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival after salvage ASCT were 15.2 months and 42.3 months, respectively.
The overall response rate (a partial response or greater) was 80.4% at day 100, excluding 6 patients who died before assessment.
Factors associated with improved PFS and overall survival after salvage ASCT included an initial PFS of > 18 months after upfront
ASCT, bortezomib-containing or lenalidomide-containing therapies for reinduction, response to reinduction, and an International
Staging System stage of I before salvage ASCT. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage ASCT is capable of achieving sustained disease control in
patients with multiple myeloma. The use of lenalidomide and bortezomib for reinduction has improved the results after salvage ASCT,
suggesting that novel agents and salvage ASCT are complementary rather than alternative treatment approaches. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
High-dose therapy (HDT) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is recommended for
patients with active multiple myeloma who are aged < 65 to 70 years and do not have serious coexisting illnesses.1 The
Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome and the British Medical Research Council conducted 2 randomized trials demonstrating the superiority of this approach compared with conventional chemotherapy, and provided evidence of a > 10-year
survival in a subset of patients.2,3 In recent years, the introduction of new drugs such as thalidomide, bortezomib, and
lenalidomide has significantly improved response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Before
1996, the median OS among patients who required therapy was approximately 3 years,4 whereas in the era of new agents
and ASCT, the median OS after ASCT is close to 8 years.5 With regard to first-line therapy, these data suggest that comprehensive treatment protocols combining novel agents with ASCT are complementary rather than alternative treatment
approaches.
Despite the better outcome noted with HDT and ASCT compared with conventional-dose treatment, most
patients eventually develop disease recurrence. Subsequent treatment options for patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma include salvage therapies with novel agents and/or conventional chemotherapy. In addition, HDT followed by ASCT as consolidation therapy is a clinical option for patients who are eligible for
stem cell transplantation.6-14 In the absence of data from randomized controlled trials, the British Society of
Blood and Marrow Transplantation performed a case-control study that demonstrated that the OS of patients

after salvage ASCT is superior compared with that
for patients receiving conventional chemotherapy
(32% vs 22% at 4 years; P 5 .002).11 The best outcome was observed in patients whose initial PFS
was > 24 months after upfront ASCT, because these
patients had a subsequent PFS lasting > 1 year and
an OS of nearly 6 years.14 However, the majority of
the previous studies were limited by the low numbers
of patients analyzed or were performed before the
introduction of novel agents such as lenalidomide
and bortezomib. Thus, the objective of the current
study was to evaluate the role of salvage ASCT in
terms of efficacy, particularly taking into account the
impact of novel agents in a large cohort of 200
patients with multiple myeloma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Cohort

Between June 1992 and November 2010, a total of
1262 patients with multiple myeloma received HDT
followed by ASCT at the Hematology Department
of the University Hospital Heidelberg in Heidelberg,
Germany. Herein, we retrospectively reviewed all
patients with multiple myeloma who developed disease recurrence after initial ASCT and received HDT
with melphalan followed by ASCT as salvage therapy
at our center from May 1995 to November 2010.
Patients were treated with single (126 patients) or tandem (74 patients) ASCT as part of their initial treatment. Patients who developed disease recurrence after
the upfront ASCT were considered for salvage ASCT
if their organ function was adequate, they exhibited a
good performance status at the time of disease recurrence, they had sufficient numbers of CD34-positive
cells available, and they agreed to salvage ASCT.
HDT was performed with melphalan in all patients.
Although 177 patients received the full dose of melphalan (200 mg/m2), the dose was reduced to 150
mg/m2 in 2 patients, 140 mg/m2 in 1 patient, and
100 mg/m2 in 14 patients because of abnormal kidney function (creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min) or
age > 70 years. Because of the long follow-up of the
study, no information concerning the melphalan dosage administered was available for 6 patients. At least
2.0 3 106 CD34-positive peripheral blood stem cells/
kg body weight were used for ASCT. The ethical
review board of the University of Heidelberg approved
this retrospective study and informed consent was
obtained from all patients.

Definitions and Response Assessment

A transplant was defined as salvage ASCT if the patient
had developed disease recurrence after upfront ASCT
and underwent reinduction therapy followed by salvage
ASCT after evidence of disease progression, regardless
of the number of lines of treatment administered after
upfront ASCT. Induction therapy, stem cell mobilization therapy, and HDT followed by ASCT were
counted together as a single line of treatment. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis
was performed in a subset of patients anytime before
salvage ASCT and accomplished on CD138-purified
plasma cells as previously described15 using probes for
chromosomes 1q21 and 17p13, as for the translocation
t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3). The response to treatment was
assessed according to the European Group for Blood
and Marrow Transplantation criteria for complete
response, partial response (PR), minimal response, stable disease, and progressive disease.15 These criteria
were complemented by the criteria of the International
Myeloma Working Group for the definition of a very
good PR.16 Response was assessed on day 100 (range,
60 days-150 days) after salvage ASCT. After day 100
assessments, patients were seen in the clinic at least
every 2 to 3 months.
Statistical Analysis

Differences in continuous variables between the groups
were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test. PFS was defined as the time from the date
of salvage ASCT to disease progression or death, whereas
OS was defined as the time from the date of ASCT to the
date of death from any cause. The initial PFS after upfront
ASCT was calculated from the date of stem cell infusion
of the first ASCT to the time of disease progression.
Patients still alive at the time of last follow-up were censored at that date. Estimation of PFS and OS distribution
was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. For comparisons of OS and PFS curves, the log-rank test was used.
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic impact on PFS and OS. The results were illustrated
presenting hazards ratios including 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). For the multivariate analysis, multiple
imputations using predictive mean matching were performed. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed within the R
statistical software environment (R version 2.12.2) using
the R package rms (version 3.3-0; R Foundation, Vienna,
Austria).

RESULTS
Patients

Between May 1995 and November 2010, 200 patients
received salvage ASCT for recurrent multiple myeloma at
the study institution. Clinical characteristics are shown in
Table 1. The median follow-up for all patients since salvage ASCT was 57.1 months (95% CI, 52.7 months-63.6
months). During follow-up, 111 deaths occurred. At the
time of salvage ASCT, the median age of the patients was
60 years (range, 29 years-72 years); 20% of the patients
were aged > 65 years.
Treatment Algorithm and Patient Outcome

After upfront ASCT, the initial median PFS was 64.6
months (95% CI, 56.8 months-74.3 months), whereas
the median OS was 87.3 months (95% CI, 81.4 months101.3 months). Within 6 months after the first ASCT, 74

patients were consolidated with a second HDT with melphalan followed by ASCT as part of the initial treatment.
All patients received reinduction therapy before salvage
ASCT. The 100-day mortality rate after salvage ASCT
was 3% (6 patients). The presumed cause of death in these
6 patients was a severe infection within 95 days after
ASCT; however, 3 of these individuals had demonstrated
signs of early disease progression after salvage ASCT.
Maintenance therapy was initiated in 73 patients after salvage ASCT; 59 patients received thalidomide or a-interferon plus thalidomide, 3 patients received prednisone, 7
patients received a-interferon, 3 patients received lenalidomide, and 1 patient received bortezomib. On day 100
after ASCT (n 5 194 patients), the response assessment
revealed a complete response, very good PR, PR, minimal
response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 25

and 11 (5.7%) patients, respectively. The overall response
rate (PR) was 80.4% at day 100, excluding the 6
patients who died before assessment. After salvage ASCT,
the median PFS was 15.2 months (95% CI, 13.3 months17.6 months), whereas the median OS was 42.3 months
(95% CI, 33.5 months-49.7 months).
Impact of Prognostic Factors on PFS and OS

Prognostic variables before salvage ASCT examined for
their impact on PFS and OS in univariate Cox regression
models that included age; gender; multiple myeloma isotype; number of upfront transplantations (single vs tandem ASCT); number of prior regimens; exposure to novel
agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib; use of maintenance therapy after upfront and salvage
ASCT; initial PFS after upfront ASCT; response to
upfront ASCT as to reinduction before salvage ASCT;
ISS stage at diagnosis and before salvage ASCT; and lactate dehydrogenase levels at the time of diagnosis and
before salvage ASCT.
On univariate analysis (Table 2) (Fig. 1), the most
important factors found to be predictive for PFS and OS
were initial PFS after upfront ASCT ( 12 months vs 13

months-18 months vs > 18 months; P 5 .24 and
P 5 .001, respectively), ISS stage before salvage ASCT
(I vs II vs III; P 5 .10 and P < .001, respectively), achievement of at least a PR after reinduction (yes vs no; P 5 .02
and P 5 .17, respectively), and the use of bortezomib or
lenalidomide for reinduction before salvage ASCT (yes vs
no; P 5 .25 and P<.001, respectively).
For the entire group of patients, a lack of response to
reinduction therapy, short initial PFS time after upfront
ASCT, and non-immunoglobulin G isotype were identified
as independent predictors for adverse PFS on multivariate
analysis (Table 3). In addition, a short initial PFS time after
upfront ASCT, no use of bortezomib or lenalidomide for
reinduction, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels at salvage
ASCT, and an ISS stage of II or III before salvage ASCT
were found to be independent predictors for OS.
Prognostic Stratification According to Response
Time and ISS Stage

Based on the results of the univariate and multivariate
analyses, we analyzed whether combining the ISS stage
before salvage ASCT with information regarding the
initial PFS after upfront ASCT could improve the

prognostic value with regard to patients’ OS (Fig. 2). A
combination of the initial PFS after upfront ASCT ( 18
months vs > 18 months) with the ISS stage (I vs II/III)
allowed patients to be stratified into 3 distinct groups:
those at low risk (> 18 months and ISS stage I), those at
high risk ( 18 months and ISS stage II/III), and those at
intermediate risk (the remaining patients). The majority
of the patients belonged to the low-risk (51.6%) and intermediate-risk (39.8%) groups, whereas only 8.6% were
allocated to the high-risk group. The median OS
decreased from 58.5 months in the low-risk group to 33.9
months and 13.5 months in the intermediate-risk and
high-risk groups, respectively (P < .0001). With regard to
PFS, the prognostic stratification according to response
time and ISS stage was found to be of only marginal significance (P 5 .04).
Correlation of Chromosomal Aberrations With
Patient Outcome

We analyzed the prognostic impact of chromosomal aberrations on PFS and OS for a subgroup of patients with
available cytogenetic data. Interphase FISH analysis of
CD138-enriched plasma cells was only performed on a regular basis after January 2004; therefore, this data point was
not available for all patients. Cytogenetic analysis revealed
gains of chromosomes 1q21 in 41 of 71 patients (58%)
and deletions of chromosome 17p13 in 14 of 80 patients
(18%). Furthermore, the immunoglobulin H translocation
t(4;14) was observed in 9 of 80 patients (11%).
The presence of del(17p13), t(4;14), and 11q21
was associated with adverse impact on both PFS and OS.
Cancer

However, due to the low numbers of patients, this effect
did not reach statistical significance when each subgroup
was analyzed individually. Therefore, patient status was
classified as either “favorable” or “adverse” according to
Avet-Loiseau et al19: “adverse” FISH was defined as the
cytogenetic abnormalities 11q21, t(4;14), and
del(17p13), whereas “favorable” FISH was defined by the
absence of these cytogenetic abnormalities (Fig. 3). The
median PFS for patients with adverse FISH was 13.2
months versus 25.6 months for those with favorable FISH
(P 5 .03); the 4-year OS rate was 52% versus 71%,
respectively (P 5 .09).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is one of
the largest studies published to date describing the impact
of salvage ASCT in patients with multiple myeloma in a
series of 200 patients. An overall response rate (PR) was
obtained in 80.4% of these patients. When the response
to reinduction was compared with the response after salvage ASCT at day 100, the remission status was improved
in 72 patients, whereas 4 patients were diagnosed with
progressive disease. It is interesting to note that only a
small number of patients received novel agents as part of
their primary therapy, which most likely explains the high
response rates to reinduction treatment and salvage
ASCT. PFS and OS were 15.2 months and 42.3 months,
respectively, after salvage ASCT. This compares favorably
with previously published smaller studies in this setting,
although those studies are very heterogeneous in terms of
patient selection, the agents used for reinduction, the type

of conditioning regimen, and the application of maintenance therapy. In the current study, all patients received
reinduction therapy. In addition, melphalan was used as
HDT in all patients. We found salvage ASCT to be a feasible and safe treatment option in patients with recurrent
multiple myeloma, as demonstrated by a 100-day mortality rate of 3%. However, 2 studies reported a 100-day
mortality rate of 8%,8,11 suggesting that treatment-related
mortality with salvage ASCT might be greater than that
after an upfront transplant.1 This may be a consequence
of a presumably poorer performance status and higher age
when patients are treated with salvage ASCT.
To the best of our knowledge, randomized controlled studies evaluating the role of salvage ASCT or systematic outcome analyses including cytogenetic data in
the setting of recurrent multiple myeloma are missing.
Thus, there is a lack of clear guidance and criteria for the
selection of patients who may best benefit from this
approach. In general, the results of the current study
demonstrate that it is easier to predict OS than PFS after
salvage ASCT. The reason for this might be that the

majority of the prognostic factors identified to date are
not treatment specific for salvage ASCT and reflect the
natural course of disease. Patients with favorable prognostic factors before salvage ASCT (ie, low ISS stages and
long PFS times after upfront ASCT) might also have a
good chance of responding to additional lines of treatment, in particular in the area of novel drugs. To date, the
initial PFS after upfront ASCT appears to be the most robust selection criteria for patients before salvage
ASCT.9,11,12,14 In the current study, patients whose initial
PFS after upfront ASCT was < 12 months reached a median PFS and OS of 7.2 months and 11.6 months, respectively, after salvage ASCT, whereas a median PFS and OS

of 15.8 months and 49.2 months, respectively, were
achieved if the initial PFS was > 18 months.
It is known that the ISS stage reflects tumor burden
and is correlated with kidney function.18 Because a substantial percentage of patients with multiple myeloma are
transferred to transplantation centers with incomplete
information regarding their prognostic factors at diagnosis, we assessed the ISS stage obtained at the time of salvage ASCT, which was available in 186 of 200 patients
(93%). Patients with an ISS stage of I achieved a nearly
doubled median OS compared with patients with an ISS
stage of II or III (56.3 months vs 27.6 months vs 18.1
months, respectively; P 5 .004).
Because our statistical analyses revealed that initial
PFS after upfront ASCT and ISS stage before salvage
ASCT were the 2 most important factors for OS, we combined both variables to improve the prognostic value with
regard to patients outcome. The prognostic stratification
developed based on initial PFS and ISS stage allows for
the identification of patients who might benefit the most
by undergoing salvage ASCT. Although the results
obtained by this model appear to be very robust in the current study, they must be confirmed in independent
patient cohorts.
It is interesting to note that the results of the current
study confirm the prognostic impact of chromosomal
aberrations in the context of salvage ASCT. Because 2
recent studies demonstrated that t(4;14), del(17p13), and
11q21 are most likely the most relevant chromosomal
aberrations for predicting outcome at upfront ASCT,15,19
we used these abnormalities to define patients with favorable and adverse cytogenetic risk. We found that patients
with adverse cytogenetic factors had a significantly shorter
PFS, whereas the results regarding OS did not reach statistical significance due to only few events taking place to
date, suggesting that a longer follow-up time is required.
There are some general limitations of retrospective
studies in analyzing the role of salvage ASCT in patients
with multiple myeloma. We and other authors were not
able to perform an intent-to-treat analysis (ie, it is not
clear how many patients failed to mobilize sufficient stem
cells and therefore could not be considered for salvage
transplant). The patients in the current study had an
excellent median PFS of 64.6 months after upfront
ASCT, suggesting a selection bias toward young and fit
patients with low-risk disease.
In the age of novel agents, salvage ASCT can be costeffective and capable of providing durable benefit. But
how can we move forward and improve the results of salvage ASCT? From randomized trials performed in

patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, we
have learned that bortezomib-based and lenalidomidebased induction therapies improve the results prior and
after upfront ASCT compared with treatments without
any novel agents.1 In addition, recently published studies
demonstrated that thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib are all capable of enhancing disease control when
given after ASCT as part of the initial treatment.20-22 The
results of the current study demonstrated that the outcome of patients can be improved when lenalidomide or
bortezomib are used for reinduction therapy, thereby supporting the concept of the early use of novel agents such as
lenalidomide and bortezomib in the setting of disease
recurrence.23 For nontransplant candidates, a variety of
contemporary regimens are available as options for salvage
therapy as listed in the latest version of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.24 In addition, the
US Food and Drug Administration recently approved the
new proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib for patients with
multiple myeloma who develop disease progression
during or after therapy with bortezomib and an immunomodulatory derivative such as thalidomide or
lenalidomide.25
So, is there still a place for salvage ASCT when multiple myeloma therapies become more effective in the setting of disease recurrence? Comparative controlled studies
in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma
are warranted to help guide clinicians in choosing appropriate salvage therapy. Therefore, we initiated an ongoing
phase 3 trial within the German Multiple Myeloma
Group study group for patients with recurrent multiple
myeloma who are eligible for transplant (European Clinical Trials Database [EudraCT] no. 2009-013856-61),
analyzing the role of ASCT after induction with 3 cycles
of lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared with treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone until disease
progression.
Salvage ASCT is capable of achieving sustained disease control in patients with recurrent multiple myeloma.
The use of lenalidomide and bortezomib for reinduction
has improved the results after salvage ASCT, suggesting
that novel agents and salvage ASCT are complementary
rather than alternative treatment approaches. Stratification by PFS after upfront ASCT and ISS stage allows for
the prediction of survival after salvage ASCT. To circumvent the problem of stem cell harvest in intensively pretreated patients, we recommend the collection and
cryopreservation of a sufficient amount of stem cells for
both upfront and salvage ASCT early in the course of
myeloma treatment.
