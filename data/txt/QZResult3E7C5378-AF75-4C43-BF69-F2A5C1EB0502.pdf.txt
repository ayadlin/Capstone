Abstract
Werner syndrome is genetically linked to mutations in WRN that encodes a DNA helicase-nuclease believed to
operate at stalled replication forks. Using a newly identiﬁed small-molecule inhibitor of WRN helicase (NSC
617145), we investigated the role of WRN in the interstrand cross-link (ICL) response in cells derived from patients
with Fanconi anemia, a hereditary disorder characterized by bone marrow failure and cancer. In FA-D2/
cells, NSC 617145 acted synergistically with very low concentrations of mitomycin C to inhibit proliferation in
a WRN-dependent manner and induce double-strand breaks (DSB) and chromosomal abnormalities. Under
these conditions, ataxia–telangiectasia mutated activation and accumulation of DNA-dependent protein kinase,
catalytic subunit pS2056 foci suggested an increased number of DSBs processed by nonhomologous end-joining
(NHEJ). Rad51 foci were also elevated in FA-D2/ cells exposed to NSC 617145 and mitomycin C, suggesting that
WRN helicase inhibition interferes with later steps of homologous recombination at ICL-induced DSBs. Thus,
when the Fanconi anemia pathway is defective, WRN helicase inhibition perturbs the normal ICL response,
leading to NHEJ activation. Potential implication for treatment of Fanconi anemia–deﬁcient tumors by their
sensitization to DNA cross-linking agents is discussed. Cancer Res; 73(17); 5497–507. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Werner syndrome, characterized by premature aging and
cancer predisposition (1), is caused by autosomal recessive
mutations in WRN (2), encoding a RecQ DNA helicase-nuclease
implicated in genomic stability (3, 4). WRN helicase can
unwind key homologous recombination DNA intermediates
and interacts with proteins implicated in DNA replication,
recombinational repair, and telomere maintenance (5). Werner syndrome cells are sensitive to certain DNA-damaging
agents, and display defects in resolution of recombination
intermediates and a prolonged S-phase (6). WRN is required
for normal replication fork progression after DNA damage or
fork arrest (7).

Werner syndrome cells are sensitive to interstrand crosslink (ICL)–inducing agents (8) and undergo apoptosis in Sphase (9). Cellular studies suggest WRN helicase, in conjunction with BRCA1, is required to process DNA ICLs (10). WRN is
required for ataxia–telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation
and the intra-S-phase checkpoint in response to ICL-induced
double-strand breaks (DSB; ref. 11), suggesting WRN and ATM
collaborate in response to collapsed forks at ICL-induced DSBs.
Biochemical studies using a reconstituted system with a DNA
substrate harboring a psoralen ICL suggested that WRN helicase is required for ICL processing (12).
Patients with Fanconi anemia suffer from progressive bone
marrow failure and cancer predisposition, and their cells (such
as Werner syndrome cells) are sensitive to ICL agents, only to a
greater extent (13). In fact, a chromosome breakage test using
Fanconi anemia patient cells exposed to an ICL-inducing agent
is used as a primary diagnostic tool for Fanconi anemia (14).
The Fanconi anemia pathway is involved in initial recognition
and unhooking of an ICL and subsequent repair of the ICLinduced DSB in conjunction with homologous recombination
or translesion synthesis pathways, but the detailed molecular
mechanism is an active area of investigation (15). One function
of the Fanconi anemia pathway is to channel DSBs through
the homologous recombination pathway, thereby preventing
inappropriate engagement of breaks by error-prone nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ; refs. 16, 17). However, the relationship between DNA repair pathways is complex, as evidenced by a recent mouse study showing that deletion of 53BP1
or Ku exacerbates genomic instability in FANCD2-deﬁcient
cells (18).

Aggarwal et al.

To understand the role of WRN in the ICL response, we
examined effects of a small-molecule WRN helicase inhibitor
in a Fanconi anemia–mutant genetic background. A more
potent structural analog of the previously identiﬁed parent
compound NSC 19630 (19) was discovered that is blocked
from potential thiol reactivity but retains the ability to modulate WRN function in vivo. The WRN helicase inhibitor NSC
617145 acted synergistically with a very limited concentration
of mitomycin C to induce DSB accumulation and chromosomal abnormalities, and activate the DNA damage response in
Fanconi anemia–mutant cells. NSC 617145 exposure resulted
in enhanced accumulation of DNA-dependent protein kinase,
catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) pS2056 foci and Rad51 foci in
mitomycin C–treated Fanconi anemia–deﬁcient cells, suggesting that WRN helicase inhibition prevents processing of Rad51mediated recombination products and activates NHEJ. WRN
helicase may be a suitable target for chemotherapy strategies
in Fanconi anemia–deﬁcient tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture
HeLa (CCL-2), U2OS (HTB96), and HCT116 (CCL-247) cell
lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
where they were tested and authenticated. HCT116 p53 double
knockout cells were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. B.
Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) where
they were tested and authenticated (20). All these cell lines
were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, and 1% Lglutamine at 37 C in 5% CO2. PSNF5 [Bloom syndrome
(BLM)–corrected] and PSNG13 (BLM-mutant) are isogenic
cell lines that were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. I.
Hickson (University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark)
where they were tested and authenticated (21, 22). PSNF5 is a
stable BLM cell line expressing a FLAG epitope-tagged, wildtype BLM protein from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter
in a pcDNA3-based construct. PSNG13 is a control BLM cell
transfectant containing the pcDNA3 vector only. The BLMmutant and -corrected cell lines were grown in the same media
as HeLa cells but supplemented with 350 mg/mL G418. The
simian virus 40–transformed Fanconi anemia–mutant ﬁbroblasts, PD20 (FA-D2), GM6914 (FA-A), and their respective
corrected counterparts were provided by Fanconi Anemia Cell
Repository at Oregon Health & Science University (Portland,
OR) where they were tested and authenticated. Fanconi anemia–mutant and -corrected cells were grown in the same
medium as HeLa cells but supplemented with 0.2 mg/mL
puromycin.
Cell proliferation assays
Proliferation was measured using WST-1 assay (Roche) as
described previously (19).
siRNA transfection and Western blot analysis
WRN siRNA (WH: 50 -UAGAGGGAAACUUGGCAAAUU-30
and/or CG: 50 -GUGUAUAGUUACGAUGCUAGUGAUU-30 ) and
control siRNA (19) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
as per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were

5498

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

plated to 50% to 60% conﬂuence in 10-cm dishes 24 hours
before transfection. siRNA (0.6 nmol) was mixed with 30 mL of
Lipofectamine 2000 in 3 mL of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The
mixture was added to cells that were subsequently incubated
for 6 hours. After 24 hours, a second transfection was carried
out similarly. Seventy-two hours after the initial transfection,
cells were harvested for preparing lysate or treated with smallmolecule compounds or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at the
indicated concentrations and cell proliferation was measured
using WST-1 reagent (Roche) as described for HeLa cells. For
Fanconi anemia–mutant cells, siRNA transfection and treatment with NSC 617145 was carried out as described previously
except that OD450 was measured after 48 hours of treatment
with mitomycin C and/or NSC 617145.
For lysate preparation, cells were washed twice with 1 PBS.
Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer [10 mmol/L
sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 300 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1%
NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 2 mmol/L EDTA] was
added to the cells and the cells were incubated at 4 C for 30
minutes. Cells were scraped and the suspension was further
incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Cell suspension was centrifuged at 18,500  g for 10 minutes at 4 C and supernatant was
collected. Twenty microgram of the lysate was loaded on 8% to
16% SDS-PAGE. Protein was transferred onto a polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane and blot was probed with antiWRN mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; Spring Valley
Laboratories). For secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated
anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:1,000; Vector Laboratories) was used. Blot was developed using ECL Plus Western
Blot Detection Kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham). As a loading control, blot was stripped and then
reprobed with anti-actin antibody (1:5,000; Sigma).
Analysis of metaphase chromosomes
Cell harvest and metaphase slide preparation was carried
out for metaphase analysis as described previously (23).
See Supplementary Data for additional information.

Results
Inhibition of WRN helicase activity by small-molecule
NSC 617145
To identify small molecules that inhibit WRN helicase
activity in a more potent manner than the previously identiﬁed
compound NSC 19630 (19), we selected four close structural
analogs and three compounds whose pattern of activity in the
NCI60 screen matched NSC 19630 for analysis (Supplementary
Fig. S1). One of the latter compounds, NSC 617145, is also a
structural analog, but blocked with respect to thiol reactivity in
the ﬁve-membered rings by Cl atoms. NSC 617145 inhibited
WRN helicase activity in a concentration-dependent manner in
vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2A), yielding an IC50 value of 230
nmol/L. NSC 617145 inhibited WRN ATPase in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S2B). No detectable effect on
WRN exonuclease was observed (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
To examine speciﬁcity of WRN helicase inhibition, we tested
5 mmol/L NSC 617145 (20-fold >IC50 value) on DNA unwinding catalyzed by various helicases. No signiﬁcant inhibition of
unwinding was observed with BLM, FANCJ, ChlR1, RecQ, and

Figure 1. NSC 617145 inhibits cell proliferation in a WRN-speciﬁc manner. A, HeLa cells were treated with DMSO or indicated NSC 617145 concentration for
0 to 3 days. B, HeLa cells were exposed to 1.5 mmol/L NSC 617145 for 3 days, replenished with media lacking NSC 617145, and allowed to recover
for 0 to 3 days. C, HeLa cells either untransfected (HeLa) or transfected with nonspeciﬁc siRNA (NS siRNA) or WRN-speciﬁc siRNA (WRN siRNA) were treated
with DMSO or 1.5 mmol/L NSC 617145 for indicated number of days. Cell proliferation was then determined with WST-1 reagent. Percentage proliferation was
calculated. Experiments were repeated three times, and error bars indicate SD. This applies to all ﬁgures.

UvrD, and only a very modest (7%) inhibition of RECQ1
(Supplementary Fig. S2D) was observed.
To determine their potency in vivo, HeLa cells were exposed
to increasing concentrations of selected analogs or DMSO for 0
to 3 days. Of the selected analogs, NSC 617145 showed maximal
inhibition of proliferation (98%) at the lowest concentration of
NSC 617145 (1.5 mmol/L; Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S3). To
address whether the effect was cytostatic or cytotoxic, HeLa
cells were exposed to NSC 617145 for 3 days, replenished
with media lacking NSC 617145, and allowed to recover for
0 to 3 days (Fig. 1B). The lack of recovery from NSC 617145
suggested a cytotoxic effect. To determine whether the effect
of NSC 617145 was WRN-dependent, we compared its effect
on HeLa cells depleted of WRN (90%) with NS-siRNA–
transfected cells. WRN-depleted cells grown in the presence
of 1.5 mmol/L NSC 617145 were resistant to its antiproliferative effects, whereas NS-siRNA HeLa cells were highly
sensitive to NSC 617145 (Fig. 1C). These results were conﬁrmed by 2 different WRN-siRNA molecules that independently conferred resistance to NSC 617145 (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Western blot analyses showed that WRN depletion
by either WRN-siRNA or combination was more than 90%
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
NSC 617145 may exert its effect through a mechanism in
which the NSC 617145–inhibited WRN helicase induces greater
damage by interfering with a compensatory mechanism(s). To
determine whether the effect of NSC 617145 is dependent on a
helicase-active version of WRN, HeLa cells were depleted of

www.aacrjournals.org

endogenous WRN, and siRNA-resistant WRN [wild-type or
helicase inactive K577M (24)] was expressed. The resulting
cells were tested for sensitivity to NSC 617145. It was observed
that the WRN-depleted cells rescued with wild-type WRN were
sensitive to the WRN helicase inhibitor compared with empty
vector–transfected cells, supporting the ﬁnding that the inhibition of cell proliferation by NSC 617145 is WRN-dependent
(Supplementary Fig. S5). However, WRN-depleted cells expressing the helicase-inactive WRN-K577M behaved similar to the
WRN-depleted cells transfected with empty vector, suggesting
that they were resistant to the negative effect of WRN helicase
inhibitor NSC 617145 on cell viability.
Because NSC 617145 inhibited proliferation of p53-inactivated HeLa cells, we examined its effect on proliferation of
U2OS cells with wild-type p53. NSC 617145 (1.5 mmol/L)
inhibited U2OS proliferation by 80% after day 2 (Supplementary Fig. S6A), suggesting that the effect of NSC 617145
was not dependent on p53 status. We also tested a pair of
isogenic p53-negative and -positive HCT116 cells for sensitivity to NSC 617145 (1.5 mmol/L). Both cell lines were
sensitive to the compound; however, p53-deﬁcient cells were
2-fold more resistant than p53-proﬁcient cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Because NSC 617145 exerted a WRN-dependent effect on proliferation, we evaluated whether cells
mutated for the sequence-related BLM helicase were sensitive. BLM-null and -corrected cells displayed similar sensitivity to NSC 617145 (Supplementary Fig. S6C), suggesting
BLM does not play a role.

Cellular exposure to NSC 617145 causes accumulation of
DSBs, blocked replication forks, and apoptosis
Because WRN-deﬁcient cells are defective in resolution of
recombination intermediates (6), NSC 617145 inhibition of
WRN helicase activity might result in DSBs at blocked replication forks. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of NSC 617145
on g-H2AX foci, a marker of DSBs. Exposure of HeLa cells to
0.25 mmol/L NSC 617145 elevated g-H2AX foci approximately
18-fold compared with DMSO-treated cells (Supplementary
Fig. S7A and S7B). WRN-siRNA–treated HeLa cells showed a
similar low number of g-H2AX foci in NSC 617145- and DMSOtreated cells, suggesting that inhibition of WRN activity in vivo
by NSC 617145 led to DSB accumulation in a WRN-dependent
manner. H2AX phosphorylation can be induced by a wide
range of phenomenon including DSBs; therefore, we examined
the effect of NSC 617145 on 53BP1 foci, an independent marker
of DNA damage (25). Cellular exposure to 0.25 mmol/L NSC
617145 elevated 53BP1 foci 3.5-fold compared with DMSOtreated cells, conﬁrming NSC 617145 induced DNA damage
(Supplementary Fig. S7C and S7D).
HeLa cells exposed to 1.5 mmol/L NSC 617145 showed a 4fold increase in apoptosis as compared with DMSO-treated
cells (Supplementary Fig. S8). WRN-depleted HeLa cells
showed no difference in level of apoptosis in NSC 617145and DMSO-treated cells, showing WRN-dependent induction of apoptosis by NSC 617145. Failure to repair DNA
damage would affect replication fork progression; therefore,
we determined the effect of NSC 617145 on proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) foci formation. HeLa cells exposed
to 0.25 mmol/L NSC 617145 showed an elevated number of
PCNA foci (22-fold) compared with DMSO-treated cells
(Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B). In contrast, WRN-depleted cells showed similar levels of PCNA staining for NSC
617145- or DMSO-treated cells, suggesting WRN-dependent
accumulation of stalled replication foci. Consistent with the
PCNA induction, exposure of HeLa cells to NSC 617145
(1 mmol/L) resulted in an increased population in S-phase
compared with DMSO-treated cells (Supplementary Fig.
S10). We also observed from ﬂuorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis a sub-G1 fraction of NSC 617145–
treated HeLa cells (data not shown), consistent with the
induction of apoptosis by the WRN helicase inhibitor. WRNdepleted cells exposed to 1 mmol/L NSC 617145 showed a
similar percentage of cells in S-phase compared with DMSOtreated cells, suggesting that NSC 617145 induced prolonged
S-phase in a WRN-dependent manner.
NSC 617145 induces WRN binding to chromatin and
proteasomal degradation
We reasoned that NSC 617145 might target cellular WRN for
helicase inhibition and induce toxic DNA lesions mediated by
WRN's interaction with genomic DNA, prompting us to ask
whether poisoned WRN became enriched in the chromatin
fraction. Western blot analysis of nuclear soluble and chromatin-bound fractions prepared from HeLa cells exposed to
NSC 617145 showed a dose-dependent increase in WRN bound
to chromatin (Fig. 2A). We also observed that the amount of
WRN from extract of HeLa cells exposed to NSC 617145 (0.75

5500

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

mmol/L) for 6 hours was reduced compared with DMSOtreated cells (Fig. 2B). Inclusion of proteasome inhibitor
MG132 restored WRN level to that of DMSO-treated cells (Fig.
2B). Thus, NSC 617145 causes WRN to become degraded by a
proteasome-mediated pathway. Consistent with reduction of
WRN protein in NSC 617145–treated cells, helicase activity
catalyzed by immunoprecipitated WRN from an equivalent
amount of total extract protein from HeLa cells treated with
NSC 617145 (0.75 mmol/L; 4 hours) was reduced 4-fold compared with helicase activity by immunoprecipitated WRN from
DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 2C).
Synergistic effect of NSC 617145 and DNA cross-linking
agent mitomycin C on cell proliferation
We sought to use the newly identiﬁed WRN helicase inhibitor as a tool to explore whether WRN helicase activity helps
cells cope with stress imposed by the DNA cross-linking agent
mitomycin C. Treatment with either NSC 617145 (0.5 mmol/L)
or mitomycin C (9.4 nmol/L) exerted no signiﬁcant effect on
proliferation. However, cotreatment with both NSC 617145 (0.5
mmol/L) and mitomycin C (9.4 nmol/L) resulted in a 45%
reduction in proliferation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, treatment with
NSC 617145 (0.5 mmol/L) and hydroxyurea (0–5 mmol/L) had a
similar effect on proliferation compared with hydroxyurea
alone (Supplementary Fig. S11A), suggesting that the apparent
synergism between NSC 617145 and mitomycin C is not a
general effect imposed by other forms of replicative stress such
as hydroxyurea that depletes the nucleotide pool.
NSC 617145–treated Fanconi anemia–mutant cells are
hypersensitive to mitomycin C
On the basis of the synergistic effect of NSC 617145 and
mitomycin C, we hypothesized that WRN might participate
in a pathway that is partially redundant with Fanconi
anemia–mediated ICL repair. For this, we examined sensitivity of FA-D2–mutant and -corrected cells to mitomycin C
and NSC 617145. Dose–response curves for mitomycin C and
NSC 617145 sensitivity of FA-D2 cells indicated drug concentrations at which only modest effects on proliferation
were observed (Supplementary Fig. S11B and S11C). NSC
617145 (0.125 mmol/L) or mitomycin C (9.4 nmol/L) exerted
only a mild effect on cell proliferation; however, a signiﬁcant
45% reduction was observed for cells treated with both NSC
617145 and mitomycin C (Fig. 3B). In contrast, FA-D2þ/þ
cells showed only a 10% reduction of proliferation by combined treatment of NSC 617145 and mitomycin C (Fig. 3B).
Sensitization of FA-D2/ cells to mitomycin C by WRN
helicase inhibition is distinct from the effect imposed by a
deﬁciency or inhibition of proteins in the NHEJ pathway
(LIG-4 and Ku-70), which suppress ICL-sensitivity of Fanconi
anemia–deﬁcient cells (16, 17).
Combinatorial treatment of FA-A/ cells with NSC 617145
(0.125 mmol/L) and mitomycin C (9.4 nmol/L) resulted in 60%
reduction in proliferation compared with very modest effects
exerted by either agent alone (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the effect was
dependent on FANCA status as only 10% reduction in proliferation was observed for FA-Aþ/þ cells exposed to both
mitomycin C and NSC 617145. Thus, NSC 617145 acts in a

Figure 2. NSC 617145 induces WRN to bind chromatin and WRN degradation. A, HeLa cells were exposed to increasing concentrations (0.75, 1.0, 1.5, and
2.0 mmol/L) of NSC 617145 for 4 hours. Chromatin-bound and nuclear soluble fractions were prepared and 10 mg of protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE,
followed by analysis for WRN protein by immunoblotting. A representative Western blot analysis from 1 of 3 independent experiments is shown.
Histone H3 and TopoI served as markers for the chromatin and soluble nuclear fractions, respectively. B, whole cell extracts were prepared from HeLa
cells exposed to NSC 617145 (0.75 mmol/L) or DMSO for 6 hours and proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis for WRN. As indicated,
the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 mmol/L) was added to the cell culture at the same time as NSC 617145. b-Actin and RECQL1 served as a loading
control. C, immunoprecipitated WRN obtained from an equivalent amount of protein derived from extracts of HeLa cells that had been exposed to 0.75 mmol/L
NSC 617145 or DMSO for 4 hours was tested for helicase activity on a forked duplex DNA substrate as described in Materials and Methods. A representative
helicase gel and quantitative data from at least 3 independent experiments are shown. Helicase activity from anti-WRN immunoprecipitate (white bar),
IgG control (gray bar), or anti-WRN immunoprecipitate in the absence of ATP (black bar) is indicated in bar graph.

synergistic manner with mitomycin C in either the FANCA- or
FANCD2-mutant background.
Treatment with both NSC 617145 (0.125 mmol/L) and
hydroxyurea (0–1.25 mmol/L) resulted in a very similar effect
on proliferation as compared with hydroxyurea alone in both
FA-D2/ and FA-D2þ/þ cells (Supplementary Fig. S11D and
S11E). Pretreatment of FA-D2/ cells with hydroxyurea for 24
hours followed by exposure to 0.125 mmol/L NSC 617145 for 48
hours also showed very similar inhibition of proliferation
compared with cells only exposed to hydroxyurea (Supplementary Fig. S11F), indicating NSC 617145 does not sensitize
cells to hydroxyurea.
NSC 617145 causes FA-D2–mutant cells to be
hypersensitive to mitomycin C in a WRN-dependent
manner
To determine whether enhanced mitomycin C sensitivity
of FA-D2/ cells was mediated through inhibition of WRN
function by NSC 617145, WRN was depleted by RNA interference in FA-D2/ or FA-D2þ/þ cells by 90% or more
compared with NS-siRNA cells (data not shown). WRN-depleted FA-D2/ cells grown in the presence of 0.125 mmol/L NSC

40% reduction in proliferation (Fig. 3E). In contrast, no
difference in proliferation was observed with WRN-depleted
or NS-siRNA–treated FA-D2þ/þ cells cotreated with these
NSC 617145 and mitomycin C concentrations (Fig. 3D and
E). Furthermore, WRN depletion in FA-D2/ cells did not
affect mitomycin C sensitivity as compared with NS-siRNA–
treated or untransfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S12), suggesting WRN helicase inhibition by NSC 617145 interfered
with the ability of FA-D2/ cells to cope with mitomycin C–
induced DNA damage.

with the cotreatment. Thus, accumulation of mitomycin C–
induced DNA damage in FA-D2/ cells is increased by NSC
617145.
Exposure of FA-D2/ cells with a dose range (0.125–1.5
mmol/L) of NSC 617145 led to activation of ATM as detected
by pATM-Ser1981 at 0.5 mmol/L NSC 617145 (Supplementary Fig. S13); however, no signiﬁcant activation of ATM
was observed at lower doses. In FA-D2þ/þ cells, no appreciable ATM activation was detected except at the highest NSC
617145 concentration tested, 1.5 mmol/L. Upon coexposure
of FA-D2/ cells with a very low dose of NSC 617145 (0.125
mmol/L) and mitomycin C (9.4 nmol/L), there was a signiﬁcant accumulation of pATM-Ser1981, whereas ATM
activation was not detected in FA-D2þ/þ cells (Fig. 5A).
FA-D2/ cells exposed to very low dose of NSC 617145
(0.125 mmol/L) and mitomycin C (9.4 nmol/L) retained high
levels of pATM-Ser1981 even after 24-hour exposure (data
not shown), suggesting a signiﬁcant delay in damage repair
when WRN helicase was inhibited. Thus, NSC 617145 and
mitomycin C act synergistically to induce DNA damage and
activate ATM.
NSC 617145 elevated mitomycin C–induced
chromosomal instability and induced accumulation of
DNA-PKcs pS2056 foci in FA-D2–mutant cells
Recent studies suggest the Fanconi anemia pathway plays an
important role in preventing aberrant DNA repair (16, 17).
Because NHEJ factors have high afﬁnity for DNA ends (26), the

accumulated DSBs in FA-D2/ cells, when WRN helicase
activity is pharmacologically inhibited, might promote genomic instability when captured by error-prone pathways. To
address this, we examined metaphase spreads from FA-D2/
and FA-D2þ/þ cells for chromosomal aberrations (Fig. 5B; ref.
27). FA-D2/ cells exposed to NSC 617145 (0.125 mmol/L) and
mitomycin C (9.4 nmol/L) showed a 4-fold increase in abnormal chromosome structures compared with either agent alone
(Fig. 5C). Enhanced chromosomal instability was dependent
on FANCD2 status as evidenced by the relatively low level of
chromosomal breaks in FA-D2þ/þ cells exposed to NSC 617145
and/or mitomycin C.
DNA-dependent protein kinase complex is required for
NHEJ in conjunction with Ku70/80 and XRCC4/Ligase IV;
moreover, DNA-PKcs pS2056 is detected at DSBs (28). To
substantiate the role of NHEJ in DSB processing when WRN
helicase is inhibited, FA-D2/ cells were examined for DNAPKcs pS2056 foci formation. Cotreatment of FA-D2/ cells
with limited concentrations of NSC 617145 (0.125 mmol/L) and
mitomycin C (9.4 nmol/L) resulted in 70% of cells with more
than 15 DNA-PKcs pS2056 foci (Fig. 6A and B). In contrast, only
15% of FA-D2þ/þ cells exposed to NSC 617145 and mitomycin C
showed more than 15 DNA-PKcs pS2056 foci (Fig. 6A and B).
The difference in sensitivity between FA-D2/ and FA-D2þ/þ
cells exposed to very low concentrations of either mitomycin C
or NSC 617145 was modest (mitomycin C) or hardly apparent
(NSC 617145) compared with cotreatment, suggesting that

increased chromosomal instability due to more DSBs repaired
by the error-prone pathway. Strikingly, FA-D2þ/þ cells cotreated with mitomycin C (9.4 nmol/L) and NSC 617145 (0.125
mmol/L) showed similar levels of DNA-PKcs pS2056 foci as
individually treated or DMSO control cells (Fig. 6A and B),
suggesting an important role for WRN helicase in processing of
mitomycin C–induced cross-links converted to DSBs when the
Fanconi anemia pathway is defective.
NSC 617145 exposure results in accumulation of Rad51
foci in FA-D2–mutant cells
WRN plays a physiologic role in resolution of Rad51-dependent homologous recombination products (6). Expression of
dominant-negative Rad51 or bacterial resolvase protein
RusA could suppress homologous recombination or lead to
the generation of recombinants, respectively, resulting in
improved survival of WRN/ cells. Because Rad51 foci are
formed at sites of ICL lesions independently of FA-D2 status
(29), we reasoned that WRN helicase inhibition in mitomycin
C–treated FA-D2/ cells might result in accumulation of
homologous recombination intermediates. Therefore, we
investigated the effect of NSC 617145 and mitomycin C treatment on Rad51 foci formation in Fanconi anemia–mutant and

-corrected cells. We did not observe any signiﬁcant difference
in percentage of cells that displayed Rad51 foci between
FA-D2/ and FA-D2þ/þ upon cellular exposure with mitomycin C (9.4 nmol/L), as reported previously at higher doses of
mitomycin C (29) or NSC 617145 (0.125 mmol/L; Fig. 7A and B).
In both cell lines, approximately 50% showed Rad51 foci,
similar to that observed for DMSO-treated cells. Cotreatment
of FA-D2/ cells with NSC 617145 and mitomycin C resulted
in 90% of cells staining positive for Rad51 foci. In contrast,
FA-D2þ/þ cells exposed to both agents showed a percentage of
cells with Rad51 foci very similar to DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 7A
and B). Collectively, these results suggest that mitomycin
C–induced DNA cross-links in FA-D2/ cells exposed to WRN
helicase inhibitor are converted to DSBs and the homologous
recombination pathway is activated but homologous recombination intermediates fail to be subsequently resolved.

Discussion
In this study, we discovered a new inhibitor of WRN helicase
activity (NSC 617145) that negatively affects cell proliferation
and induces DNA damage in a WRN-dependent manner.
WRN depletion negates biologic activity of NSC 617145,
suggesting targeted WRN helicase inhibition interferes with

normal cellular DNA metabolism. The synergistic effect of
NSC 617145 and mitomycin C was not observed for hydroxyurea, suggesting that impairment of WRN helicase activity
exacerbates the effect of mitomycin C–induced DNA damage
during replication but not an effect exerted by an agent
(hydroxyurea) that primarily induces replication stress. We
used the WRN helicase inhibitor to sensitize a Fanconi
anemia–mutant because mounting evidence points toward
a pivotal role of the Fanconi anemia pathway to coordinate a
robust ICL response when WRN is also likely to act. WRN
helicase inhibition by NSC 617145 makes FA-A or FA-D2 cells
highly sensitive to very low mitomycin C concentrations that
would otherwise be only marginally active in normal cells.
Furthermore, the effect of combined mitomycin C/NSC
617145 treatment is a consequence of a Fanconi anemia
pathway deﬁciency rather than a defect in a speciﬁc Fanconi
anemia gene.

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

The synergistic effect of NSC 617145 and mitomycin C in the
FA-D2–mutant was apparent by robust g-H2AX staining, ATM
activation, and increased chromosomal abnormalities. Moreover, accumulation of DNA-PKcs pS2056 foci suggests that
FA-D2 cells attempted to deal with mitomycin C–induced
DSBs by error-prone NHEJ when WRN helicase was pharmacologically inhibited. This ﬁnding builds on previous evidence
that the Fanconi anemia pathway plays an important role in
preventing aberrant NHEJ-mediated repair (16, 17), and implicates a role of WRN helicase in repair pathway choice. In
addition to its helicase-dependent role in recombinational
repair, WRN may have a structural role to enable repair of
mitomycin C–induced DNA damage. This would be akin to the
observation that a WRN helicase/exonuclease double-mutant
complemented the NHEJ defect of WRN/ cells (30). Although
experimental data suggest that WRN participates in an alternative NHEJ repair pathway of DSBs induced by increased

reactive oxygen species in chronic myeloid leukemia cells (31),
it is unclear whether this pathway is relevant to a role of WRN
helicase to confer mitomycin C resistance in Fanconi anemia–
deﬁcient ﬁbroblasts. Further studies will be necessary to
evaluate whether an alternate end-joining pathway or homologous recombination is important for repair of mitomycin
C–induced lesions in the WRN helicase-inhibited condition.
We also observed Rad51 foci accumulation in FA-D2/
cells cotreated with mitomycin C and NSC 617145, suggesting
that homologous recombination was activated and at least
some DSBs were channeled into homology-mediated repair.
However, as WRN plays a role in resolution of homologous
recombination intermediates (6), NSC 617145 inhibition of
WRN helicase activity might lead to accumulation of homologous recombination structures. We observed phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs only under conditions of WRN helicase
inhibition in FA-D2/ cells, suggesting that NHEJ was elicited;
however, the mechanism of DNA-PKcs recruitment is still
unclear.
Development of helicase inhibitors such as NSC 617145 that
possess chemical stability and lack of nonspeciﬁc reactivity to
thiol and other functional groups may prove useful for study of
compensatory DNA repair pathways dependent on DNA
unwinding by WRN or related helicases. In addition to their
use as research tools, small-molecular inhibitors of WRN and

other helicases may be useful for development of anticancer
strategies that rely on synthetic lethality for targeting tumors
with preexisting DNA repair deﬁciencies (32).
Demonstration that very low concentrations of the chemotherapy drug mitomycin C are cytotoxic for Fanconi
anemia–mutant cells exposed to the helicase inhibitor may
have implications for strategies that target Fanconi anemia
DNA repair pathway–deﬁcient tumors. Certain sporadic
head and neck, lung, ovarian, cervical, and hematologic
cancers are characterized by epigenetic silencing of wildtype Fanconi anemia gene expression (33). It is estimated
that 15% of all cancers harbor defects in the Fanconi anemia
pathway (34). A signiﬁcant number of these tumors may
become reliant on WRN or other helicases to deal with DNA
damage such as strand breaks. WRN may be a suitable target
for pharmacologic inhibition to sensitize Fanconi anemia–
deﬁcient tumors to chemotherapy drugs such as DNA crosslinkers.
In addition to epigenetic silencing, LOH from an additional
mutation in an Fanconi anemia gene in heterozygous carriers
may lead to increased cancer risk later in life (33, 35). Fanconi
anemia pathway–deﬁcient ﬁbroblasts were found to be highly
sensitive to silencing of ATM kinase (33). FANCG- and FANCCdeﬁcient pancreatic tumor lines were sensitive to a pharmacologic inhibitor of ATM, raising the possibility for an

anticancer treatment. More recently, Fanconi anemia–deﬁcient cell lines were shown to be hypersensitive to inhibition of
CHK1 kinase either by siRNA or a pharmacologic inhibitor of
CHK1 kinase activity (36). Unlike the hypersensitivity of Fanconi anemia–deﬁcient cells to CHK1 silencing or kinase inhibition, WRN depletion did not increase sensitivity of FA-D2/
cells to mitomycin C. This suggests that NSC 617145 exerted its
effect through a dominant-negative mechanism in which NSC
617145–inhibited WRN helicase induced greater damage by
blocking compensatory mechanism(s). Inhibition of WRN or a
related helicase by a small molecule may provide an alternative
strategy for targeting Fanconi anemia–deﬁcient tumors that is
unique from approaches such as targeting the CHK1 or ATM
kinase response.
