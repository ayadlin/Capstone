BACKGROUND: The incidence, dynamics, and management of cytopenias were investigated in patients
with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CP CML) who received dasatinib therapy after imatinib
failure. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 130 patients with CP CML who were treated with dasatinib
from November 2003 to March 2006 in phase 1 (n ¼ 22) or phase 2 or 3 (n ¼ 108) studies for the development of grade 2 to 4 cytopenia (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
[version 3.0]). RESULTS: Grade 2 to 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia occurred in 94 (72%) patients
during dasatinib therapy and grade 3 to 4 occurred in 67 (52%) patients. Of the 94 patients who developed
grade 2 to 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, 64 (68%) also developed at least grade 2 anemia, and
16 (17%) developed grade 3 to 4 anemia. Management of cytopenias included transient dasatinib interruption in 35 (37%) patients, filgrastim in 12 (14%) patients, recombinant erythropoietin in 29 (45%) patients,
and interleukin-11 in 3 (5%) patients. Factors associated with an increased risk for developing grade 2 to 4
cytopenias were longer time from diagnosis to treatment, prior interferon or imatinib therapy, and a lower
white blood cell count at the initiation of dasatinib therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Hematologic toxicity was frequent during dasatinib therapy in patients with CP CML, particularly at doses >100 mg daily. Treatment
interruption and/or dose reduction as well as growth factor support were found to be safe and efficacious

with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).2 In phase 2 studies, dasatinib administered at a dose of 70 mg twice daily
to patients in chronic phase (CP) with resistance or intolerance of imatinib therapy rendered a complete
hematologic response (CHR) in >90% of patients,
whereas a major (MCyR) and a complete cytogenetic
response (CCyR) was achieved by 55% and 44% of
patients, respectively, after 24 months of follow-up.3 Nonhematologic adverse effects, although relatively frequent
during dasatinib therapy, are usually mild and manageable.
In a dose-finding study of dasatinib in patients with CML,
the most frequent nonhematologic toxicities were diarrhea
(23%), peripheral edema (19%), pleural effusion (18%),
and headache (10%).2 By contrast, grade 3 neutropenia
(absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <109/L) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50  109/L) have been observed in
45% and 35% of patients with CP CML, respectively.2 The
incidence of grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity is remarkably
higher in patients with more advanced stages of the disease.
Hematologic toxicity requires transient interruptions of
dasatinib therapy in approximately 60% of patients, and
this toxicity frequently resolves within 3 months, in many
cases accompanied by cytogenetic response.2 The current
management of patients with CML who develop grade 3
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia during dasatinib therapy
involves transient drug interruption, followed by dose reduction when the recovery of cytopenias requires >2 weeks.
However, dose interruptions and reductions may jeopardize
the achievement of MCyR because they reduce dasatinib
exposure/dose intensity.
A strategy to overcome the development of
hematologic toxicity and to maximize imatinib exposure in
patients with CML consists of the use of growth factors tailored to specific cytopenias.4–6 For example, granulocyte–
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) reduces the severity of
chemotherapy-associated neutropenia in patients with solid
tumors and lymphomas,7 and accelerates neutrophil regeneration in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.8 G-CSF
has also been shown to overcome imatinib-induced neutropenia in patients with CP CML.4 Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is
a megakaryopoietic cytokine that reduces the incidence
and severity of thrombocytopenia associated with chemotherapy in solid tumors and CML.5 Finally, recombinant
human erythropoietin (rh-Epo) has been administered to
patients with CML who developed anemia while receiving
imatinib therapy.6

In the current study, we determined the incidence of
hematologic toxicity among patients with CP CML who
received therapy with dasatinib in phase 1 and 2 studies at
our institution. More importantly, we evaluated the
dynamics, duration, and recurrence of cytopenias during
dasatinib therapy as well as the outcome of patients who
received supportive therapy with growth factors to ameliorate dasatinib-induced cytopenias.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Dasatinib Therapy
We investigated adult patients with a diagnosis of Philadelphia (Ph)-positive CP CML who were either newly
diagnosed or resistant or intolerant to imatinib therapy
and were receiving treatment in open-label phase 1, 2, or
3 studies of dasatinib conducted at The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Studies were approved by the institutional review board and
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent
before study entry. Patients aged 18 years were eligible
if they had imatinib-intolerant or imatinib-resistant CP
CML. Patients enrolled in the phase 1 study received
dasatinib at doses ranging from 15 mg to 180 mg, which
were administered as a single or divided dose on either a
5-days-on/2-days-off, 6-days-on/1-day-off, or continuous schedule. In phase 2 studies, dasatinib was administered on 4 oral schedules: 50 mg twice daily, 70 mg
twice daily, 100 mg daily, and 140 mg daily (Table 1).
Dasatinib Dose Modifications
Therapy with dasatinib could be interrupted and/or
reduced in response to the development of grade 3 to 4
hematologic toxicity. Dasatinib was discontinued in the
event of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia until an ANC >1.0 
109/L was reached, and reinitiated at the same dose if the
recovery occurred within 7 days or at the next lower dose
level if this recovery occurred after 7 days. If a second
episode of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred, a second
dose reduction was allowed. If grade 4 thrombocytopenia
occurred during the first 2 months of therapy, dasatinib
was interrupted until a platelet count >50  109/L was
reached and then resumed at the same dose. If a second
episode of grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred, dasatinib

dose was reduced at the next lower dose level. A second
dose level reduction was allowed in the event of a second
episode of grade 4 thrombocytopenia. When grade 3 to
4 thrombocytopenia occurred past the second month of
therapy, dasatinib was interrupted until a platelet count
>50  109/L was reached. Dose escalation was allowed
in patients who failed to achieve a CHR after 1 month, a
CCyR after 3 months of therapy, or whenever loss of
response was documented. Dasatinib was interrupted if
the toxicity was deemed unacceptable or in the event of
disease progression despite dose escalation. Other antileukemic therapies were not permitted except for anagrelide and hydroxyurea for the treatment of elevated
platelet (>700  109/L) and white blood cell (WBC)
counts (>50  109/L), respectively, for a maximum of 2
weeks. Administration of colony-stimulating factors and/
or rh-Epo and/or IL-11 was left to the discretion of the
investigator.
Patient Monitoring
Complete blood counts were performed weekly for the
first 12 weeks and every 3 months thereafter. Cytogenetic
and hematologic responses to dasatinib were assessed by
bone marrow biopsies and aspirates every 12 weeks. Assessment of dasatinib toxicities included a physical
examination conducted weekly for the first month and
every 4 weeks thereafter. Response criteria have been

detailed in previous studies.9 Briefly, a CHR required normalization for at least 4 weeks of the bone marrow (<5%
blasts) and peripheral blood with a leukocyte count
<10  109/L without blasts, promyelocytes, or myelocytes
and a platelet count <450  109/L, in addition to the disappearance of all signs and symptoms of CML. Patients
who achieved a CHR were further categorized according
to cytogenetic response as follows: no cytogenetic response
(Ph-positive 100%), minor cytogenetic response (Phpositive 36%-90%), partial cytogenetic response (PCyR;
Ph-positive 1%-35%), and CCyR (Ph-positive 0%). An
MCyR encompassed CCyR and PCyR (ie, Ph-positive
<35%). To determine molecular responses to dasatinib,
BCR-ABL1 transcripts in peripheral blood were evaluated
using quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain
reaction at baseline and every month while the patient was
on the study and compared with levels of total ABL1 transcripts. Adverse affects were evaluated at each visit and
graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (version 3.0).

Statistical Analysis
Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to
identify potential prognostic factors associated with the
development of cytopenia. The chi-square test and the
Mann-Whitney U test were used to identify prognostic
factors, which were subsequently included as variables in a
multivariate regression model for the development of
cytopen. Multivariate analysis used the multivariate logistic regression model.

RESULTS
Study Group
We evaluated 130 patients with CP CML who were
treated with dasatinib from November, 2003 to March,
2006 at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center, including 22 patients who were treated in a phase
1 study and 108 who treated in phase 2 or 3 studies (42 of
them in a phase 2 frontline study for newly diagnosed
patients). The median age of the patients was 54 years
(range, 19 years-81 years), and the median time from
CML diagnosis to the initiation of dasatinib therapy was
39 months (range, 0 months-207 months). Eighty-eight

for a median of 31 months (range, 1 month-77 months).
Imatinib therapy was withdrawn in 88% of patients due
to imatinib resistance, whereas 12% of patients exhibited
imatinib intolerance. Other prior therapies included
interferon-a in 42 (48%) patients, homoharringtonine in
11 (13%) patients, and farnesyl transferase inhibitors or

penia during dasatinib therapy, including 67 (52%)
patients in whom the toxicities were grade 3 or 4. The initial dasatinib dose in patients who developed grade 3
to 4 cytopenia was 70 mg twice daily in 23 (34%)
patients, 140 mg once daily in 8 (12%) patients, 50 mg
twice daily in 8 (12%) patients, 100 mg once daily in 16
(24%) patients, >140 mg daily in 3 (4%) patients, and
<100 mg daily in 9 (13%) patients. Grade 2 to 4 neutropenia was reported in 83 (65%) patients, and was grade 2
in 35 (28%) patients, grade 3 in 32 (25%) patients, and
grade 4 in 18 (14%) patients (Figure 1). Grade 2 to 4
thrombocytopenia occurred in 54 (42%) patients, being
grade 2 in 13 (10%) patients, grade 3 in 27 (21%)
patients, and grade 4 in 14 (11%) patients. Forty-four
(34%) patients developed concomitant grade 2 to 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, being simultaneously
grade 3 to 4 in 25 (19%) patients (Fig. 1). The median

neutropenia was 42 days (range, 2 days-415 days),
whereas the development of the first episode of thrombocytopenia occurred after a median of 31 days (range, 4
days-176 days) from the initiation of dasatinib. Grade 2
to 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia was recurrent in all
but 11 (12%) patients. The development of a first episode
of grade 2 to 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia
occurred within the first 90 days of therapy in 82 (87%)
patients, including 50 (53%) within the first 30 days.
Among those with a first occurrence before Day 90, 10
(12%) patients had no further myelosuppression after
Day 90, whereas the remainder had recurrent episodes.
Notably, despite the relatively high incidence of grade 2
to 4 neutropenia, only 1 patient was hospitalized due to
neutropenic fever resulting from pneumonia. The administration of intravenous antibiotics and G-CSF resulted in
prompt recovery of a normal ANC, which facilitated continuation of dasatinib therapy.
Management of Dasatinib-Induced
Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia

tors. Dasatinib interruptions were required during the
course of therapy due to grade 3 to 4 neutropenia or
thrombocytopenia in 35 (37%) patients. Of these, 16
(46%) patients required dasatinib dose reductions a median of 2 times (range, 1 time-4 times). Among patients
who required treatment discontinuation, the median time
off dasatinib was 24 days (range, 4 days-217 days). Twelve
patients received therapy with G-CSF (filgrastim) at doses
of 300 lg or 480 lg daily administered for 2 to 7 days per
week. G-CSF therapy was initiated after a median of
80 days (range, 11 days-495 days) from the initiation of
dasatinib. The G-CSF dose was adjusted to maintain an
ANC >1.0  109/L. The median ANC at the time
G-CSF was initiated was 0.75  109/L (range, 0.3  109/
L -0.9  109/L). G-CSF was administered concomitantly
with dasatinib therapy in 6 (50%) of 12 patients. All
patients responded to G-CSF therapy, reaching an ANC
>2.0  109/L after a median of 12 days. From the initiation of dasatinib therapy to the start of G-CSF, patients
had been off dasatinib a median of 41% of the total treatment time compared with 21% after the initiation of GCSF (P ¼ .08). The combination of dasatinib and G-CSF
was well tolerated in all cases. Before the administration of
G-CSF, none of the 12 patients treated had achieved a
MCyR. In contrast, after the initiation of G-CSF therapy,
5 of 9 evaluable patients improved their cytogenetic
response, including 1 patient with MCyR and 1 with
CCyR.
Three patients who developed grade 3 to 4 dasatinibinduced thrombocytopenia received growth factor support
with IL-11. Initially, IL-11 was administered at a dose of
10 lg/kg 3 times per week. In 2 of these patients, IL-11
was administered concomitantly with dasatinib therapy.
None of these patients had required platelet transfusion.
After the initiation of IL-11 therapy, 2 patients acheived a
platelet count >100  109/L, which occurred 94 days and
125 days, respectively, after IL-11 therapy was initiated.
One other patient developed protracted thrombocytopenia in spite of the administration of IL-11, which led to
the termination of dasatinib therapy.

4 anemia, and 15 (16%) developed grade 3 to 4 anemia.
In these patients, the median time from the initiation of
dasatinib therapy to the development of grade 3 anemia
was 16 days (range, 3 days-182 days). Twenty-nine (45%)
patients received growth factor support with rh-Epo,
including both epoetin-a (n ¼ 22) and darbepoetin-a
(n ¼ 7). Therapy with rh-Epo was titrated to maintain a
hemoglobin level >10 g/dL. Of the 29 patients who
received rh-Epo therapy, 23 (79%) experienced increments of their hemoglobin levels >2 g/dL. The median
time to achieve a hemoglobin increment 2 g/dL was 17
days (range, 7 days-84 days). However, 7 of the patients
receiving rh-Epo support required concomitant transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBC). In this subset of
patients, the median number of transfused PRBC units
was 4 (range, 2 units-10 units).

Relation Between the Development of
Cytopenia and Dasatinib Dose Schedule
Because different dasatinib dose schedules were used in
the phase 1, 2, and 3 studies, we investigated the impact
of these variables on the development of cytopenia (Table
3). Of 90 patients who received an initial daily dose of
100 mg, 57 (63%) developed grade 2 to 4 cytopenia,
compared with 37 (92%) of 40 patients who were given
dasatinib at an initial dose of >100 mg (P ¼ .001). Of the
42 newly diagnosed patients who received single-agent
dasatinib therapy as frontline therapy, 31 (74%) developed grade 2 to 4 cytopenia. Of these 31, 16 patients
3940

received dasatinib at a dose of 50 mg twice daily and 15
received dasatinib at a dose of 100 mg daily.
On univariate analysis, variables associated with a
higher risk of the development of cytopenia included longer time from diagnosis to treatment, prior interferon or
imatinib therapy, and a lower WBC (Table 4). A multivariate analysis did not identify any independent risk factors, most likely because of the high incidence of events.

DISCUSSION
Dose-dependent hematologic toxicity, frequently affecting several hematopoietic lineages, is a common adverse
effect of imatinib therapy in patients with CML.10 The
main objective of the current study was to study the
dynamics of cytopenias associated with dasatinib therapy
and the efficacy of different management strategies to
overcome this adverse event. Because the majority of
patients with advanced phase CML (accelerated phase or
blastic phase) have cytopenias even before the initiation
of therapy, we focused our investigation on 130 consecutive patients with CP CML who had failed imatinib and
subsequently received dasatinib either on an open-label
phase 1 study (n ¼ 22) or on phase 2 or 3 studies (n ¼
108). Hematologic toxicity was relatively frequent, but
this was generally manageable with transient dasatinib
interruptions, dose reductions, growth factor support, or
combinations thereof.
Hematologic toxicity is the most common grade 3
to 4 adverse event reported with imatinib therapy, particularly in patients with advanced phase CML. Interestingly, the development of new-onset grade 3 to 4
hematologic toxicity decreased drastically after 2 years of
imatinib therapy.10 Grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity is
also the most frequently reported adverse event in
patients treated with dasatinib after failure of imatinib
therapy. In a multinational phase 2 study of dasatinib
that included 387 patients with CP CML after failure of
imatinib therapy, grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were reported in 50% and 49%, respectively,
after 24 months of follow-up.11 In the current study, the
development of hematologic toxicity during dasatinib
therapy was also frequently observed, but this was reversible and manageable with dose adjustments and/or transient treatment interruptions. In our analysis, the dose
and schedule of dasatinib was not identified as a risk

factor for grade 2 to 4 myelosuppression. This was most
likely due to the high percentage of patients treated with
dasatinib as frontline therapy, all of them with a daily
dose of 100 mg. These patients had a lower incidence of
myelosuppression. When using dasatinib after imatinib
failure, a recent phase 3 study randomized patients to
receive dasatinib at either 50 mg or 70 mg twice daily or
100 mg or 140 mg once daily.12 In this study, the
durations of cytogenetic response and progression-free
survival were found to be similar across all 4 treatment
arms but there were significantly fewer cases of grade 3
to 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia in the
100-mg-daily arm compared with the other 3 arms
combined.12
To our knowledge, the exact mechanism whereby
ABL1 kinase inhibitors induce hematologic toxicity has
not been completely ascertained. In patients with
untreated CML, normal hematopoiesis relies mostly on
the Ph-positive clones. The brisk clearance of the malignant progenitors from the bone marrow by ABL1 kinase
inhibitors is believed to lead to a scenario in which the
remainder of the Ph-negative progenitors would be renCancer

dered insufficient to sustain normal blood production.
Similar to imatinib,13 dasatinib is highly selective against
Ph-positive bone marrow progenitors with little effect on
normal Ph-negative progenitors. Dasatinib at a concentration of 5 nM was not reported to inhibit the growth of
bone marrow progenitors isolated from healthy individuals, but inhibited by 60% to 80% the growth of bone marrow progenitors isolated from patients with CML, both
those expressing wild-type BCR-ABL1 and those expressing the mutant M351T isoform.14
The development of dasatinib-induced hematologic
toxicity can potentially compromise the achievement of
clinical responses. Among patients with CP CML who
were treated with imatinib, the development of grade 3 to
4 neutropenia resulted in a significantly lower probability
of achieving a CCyR compared with patients who did not
have this complication (44% vs 62%; P ¼ .03).15 This
risk has also been documented for patients who develop
grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia.15 The occurrence of these
toxicities within 45 days to 90 days after the initiation of
imatinib therapy was associated with poor survival.16
Both the prognostic implications and the decreased

probability of the achievement of CCyR secondary to the
development of hematologic toxicity during imatinib
therapy are likely to translate to patients receiving dasatinib and, in all likelihood, are a consequence of a lower
dose intensity secondary to frequent interruptions and/or
dose reductions. A potential means to overcome dasatinib-induced hematologic toxicity is the use of growth
factors. In the current study, 12 patients received therapy
with G-CSF that was adjusted to maintain an ANC
>1.0  109/L. All patients responded to G-CSF, including 6 who achieved an ANC >2.0  109/L while receiving uninterrupted dasatinib therapy. The time off
dasatinib before and after G-CSF therapy was 41% and
21%, respectively (P ¼ .08). In addition, G-CSF therapy
was associated with the achievement of MCyR in 2 of 9
evaluable patients. These results are in accord with previously reported data derived from patients with CML
receiving growth factor support for imatinib-induced
hematologic toxicity.4,5,17–19 Finally, given that potentially serious infections may ensue in the context of grade
3 to 4 neutropenia, it is remarkable that only 1 patient in
the current study required hospitalization for neutropenic
fever associated with pneumonia. This low rate of infectious complications could be due to the prompt administration of G-CSF.
Neither disease progression nor thromboembolic
events were observed in any patient receiving rh-Epo in
the current study. This is particularly important in view of
the recent public health advisory issued by the US Food
and Drug Administration regarding the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, based on an increased rate of
adverse outcomes in a series of trials involving patients
with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.20,21 Far from promoting disease progression, the use of growth factors in
the current study was found to hasten the recovery of
peripheral blood counts in most patients, which resulted
in the administration of dasatinib in a more continuous
manner. In addition, therapy with filgrastim was found to
be associated in some cases with the achievement of
cytogenetic responses (MCyR in 1 patient and CCyR in
1 patient). However, because G-CSF was initiated soon
after the beginning of therapy with dasatinib (median,
80 days), we cannot rule out the possibility that these
responses might have occurred later in the course of treatment regardless of the use of growth factor support. The

lack of adverse events reported in our trial may be due to
the finding that the dosages of rh-Epo and G-CSF were
adjusted to maintain the lowest hemoglobin and ANC
levels needed to avoid blood transfusions or infections,
respectively.
In conclusion, hematologic toxicity is a frequent
occurrence in patients with CP CML who are receiving
dasatinib. This complication can be readily managed with
transient dasatinib interruptions and dose adjustments.
Most importantly, this complication can be frequently
overcome by using growth factor support, which in this
context, is safe and allows for a more continuous dasatinib
administration that may result in improved clinical
outcomes.
