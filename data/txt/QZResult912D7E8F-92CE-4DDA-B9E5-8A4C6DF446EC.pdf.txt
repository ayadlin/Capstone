Abstract
Cancer relies upon frequent or abnormal cell division, but how the tumor microenvironment affects mitotic
processes in vivo remains unclear, largely due to the technical challenges of optical access, spatial resolution, and
motion. We developed high-resolution in vivo microscopy methods to visualize mitosis in a murine xenograft
model of human cancer. Using these methods, we determined whether the single-cell response to the antimitotic
drug paclitaxel (Ptx) was the same in tumors as in cell culture, observed the impact of Ptx on the tumor response
as a whole, and evaluated the single-cell pharmacodynamics (PD) of Ptx (by in vivo PD microscopy). Mitotic
initiation was generally less frequent in tumors than in cell culture, but subsequently it proceeded normally. Ptx
treatment caused spindle assembly defects and mitotic arrest, followed by slippage from mitotic arrest,
multinucleation, and apoptosis. Compared with cell culture, the peak mitotic index in tumors exposed to
Ptx was lower and the tumor cells survived longer after mitotic arrest, becoming multinucleated rather than
dying directly from mitotic arrest. Thus, the tumor microenvironment was much less proapoptotic than cell
culture. The morphologies associated with mitotic arrest were dose and time dependent, thereby providing a
semiquantitative, single-cell measure of PD. Although many tumor cells did not progress through Ptx-induced
mitotic arrest, tumor significantly regressed in the model. Our findings show that in vivo microscopy offers a
useful tool to visualize mitosis during tumor progression, drug responses, and cell fate at the single-cell level.

Introduction
The bulk of cancer cell biology has been conducted using
in vitro systems, with cells cultured in artificial environments. To better understand the origin and progression of
cancer and chemotherapeutic drug responses, we need in
vivo imaging data, ideally at the single-cell level. Whole-body
imaging methods, including optical, MRI, positron emission
tomography (PET), and computed tomography (CT) scans,
report on the state of tissues and diseases but generally lack
the resolution required for single-cell analysis (1). Highresolution images can be obtained from histology, but this
requires invasive biopsies or sacrificing animals at each time
point, without providing real-time data. Live cell imaging in

culture has revealed dynamic aspects of cancer cell biology
and drug responses of single cells, but how these data apply
to the situation in vivo is largely unknown. Thus, a clear need
exists for subcellular resolution intravital microscopy (IVM)
to correlate the acute responses of cells to drugs with the
ultimate fates of cells, tumors, and tissues in animal models
of human disease. In rodents, IVM typically involves a glass
window set into the animal, or an exteriorized organ (2–5),
to directly observe underlying tissues and tumors (6–9). In
optically favorable organisms such as zebra fish, drosophila,
and nematodes, IVM can visualize dynamic processes at the
single-cell level (10–12). But most applications of IVM in
rodents follow cells or groups of cells at relatively low
resolution. The challenges facing subcellular IVM include
physiologic motion, low signal to noise ratios, and slow
image capture rates that limit directly studying rapid intracellular processes and transient events at a quality comparable with culture systems. Overcoming these limitations
requires addressing issues including light penetration,
phototoxicity, and especially motion caused by breathing,
heartbeat, and muscle movements. Here, we report optimized IVM that enables highly detailed, subcellular light
microscopy to study formation of the mitotic spindle and
chromosome dynamics before and after drug delivery in
xenograft tumors (Fig. 1A–C). Using this in vivo pharmacodynamic microscopy (IPDM), we analyzed the response of
paclitaxel (Ptx), an important anticancer mitotic drug,

whose biology remains poorly understood at the wholetumor level.
Mitosis is central to tumor growth, and aneuploidy due to
mitotic errors contributes to both tumorigenesis and the
progression of cancer toward more aggressive genotypes
(13). Antimitotic drugs that perturb microtubule dynamics
are part of the chemotherapy regime for treating many
cancers, and experimental drugs against other mitotic spindle
proteins are in clinical trials (14). Ptx binds to microtubules,
interferes with polymerization dynamics, promotes mitotic
arrest, and triggers apoptosis in cancer cells (15–18). Timelapse microscopy in culture has revealed important aspects of
Ptx response dynamics and significant intracellular variability
(Fig. 1D; ref. 19). At saturating Ptx concentrations (typically
100–300 nmol/L), cells rarely die without first entering mitotic
arrest that can last 24 hours or longer depending on the cell
line (19). Postarrest, cells either initiate apoptosis or exit
without dividing into an abnormal G1-like state with multiple
small nuclei; this abnormal mitotic exit is termed mitotic
slippage (Fig. 1D; ref. 20). Once multinucleated, most cells
cannot recover normal nuclear morphology and remain
arrested, die, or attempt another mitosis that is typically
multipolar (e.g., tripolar and not bipolar). Which of these
pathways a given cell follows is highly variable both within
a cell line and between cell lines (19, 21).
Although the effects of Ptx on microtubules and mitosis are
well understood in culture (22, 23), many questions remain as
to how it promotes tumor regression in vivo, why patients with
the same diagnosis respond differently, and how resistance
arises (24). One basic question is whether Ptx kills only cells
that have entered mitosis in tumors, as in culture, that is, is Ptx

www.aacrjournals.org

solely an antimitotic drug in the tumor context? Pharmacokinetic (PK; drug concentration vs. time) and PD (drug action
vs. time) data are essential for understanding tumor
responses. In contrast to the extensive information on the
PK of Ptx (18, 25–27), its PD is complicated and requires better
understanding via a development of biomarkers, ideally at
multiple sequential steps in the drug action pathway. Two
natural biomarkers for Ptx are mitotic arrest and cell death.
These have been used as PD biomarkers in human and rodent
cancer models by scoring histology sections or stained biopsies (16, 28–30); multinucleation has been largely ignored. A
dynamic readout of these biomarkers would be more powerful, especially if it could be calibrated to measure the relative
Ptx concentration experienced by a tumor cell as a function of
dose and time. Effects of Ptx on the morphology and duration
of mitosis are concentration dependent in cell culture (31, 32),
suggesting these measurements might provide semiquantitative PD biomarkers in tumors. At low concentrations in
culture (5 nmol/L), mitosis is delayed and often exhibits
errors in chromosome alignment and segregation; at moderate concentrations (5–20 nmol/L), mitotic delays are longer
and cells often exhibit spindle multipolarity and multipolar
division; at high concentrations (>20 nmol/L), cells arrest for
many hours and then die or slip. These concentration-dependent responses have not been studied in vivo.
The questions we sought to answer included the following:
(i) Can tumor cells be visualized at a high enough resolution to
observe single-chromosome errors during mitosis and to
discriminate different morphologic biomarkers of Ptx action?
(ii) How do Ptx responses differ in culture and in tumors,
and are all Ptx effects in tumors mediated via mitotic arrest?

(iii) Can we quantify PD for a small-molecule drug using live,
subcellular imaging? To address these questions, human
tumor cell lines known to establish xenograft tumors in nude
mice were engineered to stably express fluorescent protein
fusions to histone H2b (to visualize chromatin) and/or b1tubulin (to visualize microtubules). These cell lines report on
cell-cycle state (interphase or mitotic), spindle morphology,
mitotic errors such as lagging chromosomes, mitotic arrest,
passage through mitotic arrest, and apoptosis. We used dorsal
skinfold chambers (DSC) and developed multiple approaches
for immobilization and stabilization. Figure 1A depicts the
main features of the setup. HT-1080 cells rapidly established
vascularized tumors in DSCs (Fig. 1B). Imaging with a 2
objective revealed overall tumor morphology and blood vessels, whereas our standard imaging conditions revealed
detailed morphology (Fig. 1B).

Materials and Methods
Mice
Mice were housed and handled according to Harvard
Medical Area Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
guidelines. Nu/Nu mice (Cox-7; Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) were anesthetized for DSC implantation by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a 1:10 mixture of ketamine
(50 mg/mL; Bioniche Pharma) and xylazine (100 mg/mL;
Vedco, Inc.) or by isoflurane vaporization (Harvard Apparatus)
at a flow rate of 2.0 L/min isoflurane:2.0 L/min oxygen. For cell
injection, injection of Ptx, and microscopy, mice were anesthetized by 2.0 L/min isoflurane:2.0 L/min oxygen. For more than
1 hour of imaging, the isoflurane flow rate was slowly reduced
to 0.8 to 1.2 L/min. Surgeries were conducted under sterile
conditions with a zoom stereomicroscope (Olympus SZ61).
DSC implantation
Titanium DSCs (APJ Trading Co, Inc.) were implanted into
the dorsal skinfold of Nu/Nu mice as described (2, 3, 7, 33). The
DSC stretches and sandwiches the 2 layers of skin on the back
of the mouse. On one side, the skin is surgically removed and
replaced by a 10-mm-diameter optical glass cover slip held in
place with a c-clip. Spacers between the both halves of the DSC
frame prevent excess compression of the tissue and vessels.
The window allows free-access imaging of the remaining layers
of striated skin muscle, s.c. tissue, deep dermis, and tumors.
Cell injection into DSC
Cells were harvested by trypsinization (0.25% trypsinEDTA) and resuspended in growth medium. Mice were
anesthetized and approximately 106 (50 mL) cells were injected
s.c. using a 0.5-mL insulin syringe (281/2G; BD Biosciences).
The needle was bent at 90 degrees to aid injection. Injections
were carried out under a stereomicroscope. After injection,
sterile saline was added into the DSC and it was closed with a
new cover slip. For orientation and to establish a baseline for
tumor growth, the cell mass was imaged 1 to 2 days after
injection. Tumors were rejected if there were any gross tissue
abnormalities. The procedures resulted in no mortality and
more than 95% of DSCs were adequate for microscopy. To

4610

Cancer Res; 71(13) July 1, 2011

evaluate and refine IVM methods, HeLa and U2OS cells (which
did not establish tumors in DSCs) were injected, with or
without Ptx or Kinesin-5 inhibitor (K5I) pretreatment in
culture, and imaged within 7 days.
Ptx and K5I treatment
To allow neovascularization, HT-1080 xenografts were
grown for 8 days or more before Ptx treatment. Mice were
injected in tail vein with a single bolus of 1.2, 3, 6, or 30 mg/kg
Ptx (injectable formulation, Novaplus; Bedford Laboratories),
diluted 1:4 with saline. A total of 30 mg/kg Ptx was used as the
high dose according to published data (29, 34, 35). K5I
EMD534085 (36) was from Merck Serono and was used in
culture at 500 nmol/L.
Microscopy
To reduce motion artifacts and permit high-resolution
microscopy over extended periods, a DSC holder was designed
(Fig. 1A). The setup consists of an aluminum holder attached
to an aluminum platform. The platform and DSC holder were
kept at 38 C to reduce thermal drift. The screws of the DSC fit
into machined holes in the holder and the DSC frame was
further immobilized using small plates and screws. A charged
air table reduced vibration external to the instrumentation.
Two hundred microliters of saline was injected i.p. every hour
during imaging to maintain hydration. For vascular imaging,
fluorescein isothiocyanate–dextran [molecular weight (MW)
¼ 2,000,000; Sigma-Aldrich] or Angiosense-680 (MW ¼
250,000; PerkinElmer, Inc.) was injected tail vein. A customized Olympus FV1000 based on a BX61-WI confocal microscope was used. Olympus objectives were as follows: 25
XPlan N [numerical aperture (NA) ¼ 1.05, water], 2/340
XLFluor (NA ¼ 0.14, air), 20 UPlanFL (NA ¼ 0.50), and 60
LUMFL N (NA ¼ 1.10, water). Enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP), monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP),
TagRFP, and Angiosense-680 were excited using a 488-nm
argon ion laser line, 559-nm pumped solid-state laser, or 635nm diode laser, respectively, in combination with a DM405/
488/559/635-nm dichroic beam splitter. Emitted light was
separated and collected with beam splitters SDM560 and
SDM640 and band-pass filters BA505-540, BA575-620, and
BA655-757. Control tumors were used to optimize imaging
conditions resulting in no photobleaching or phototoxicity.
Using a motorized x–y stage, 5 z-stack time series with 10 to 20
optical sections (5 mm per section), at 30 seconds to 5 minutes
intervals, were collected. Small drifts in focus were corrected
in real time, using the z-adjustment feature of FluoView 1000
software.

Results
Visualization of detailed mitotic morphology in vivo
We used HT-1080 cells in all experiments but confirmed
general concepts by using HeLa and U2OS. HeLa cells expressing both H2b-mRFP and mEGFP–a-tubulin were used to
convey chromosomes and the mitotic spindle simultaneously
(Fig. 2). Progression through normal mitosis was readily
observed (Fig. 2A–D; Supplementary Movie 1). At higher

magnification, kinetochore fibers and spindle poles were well
resolved (Fig. 2E), showing that critical mitotic structures can
be studied in vivo by using the IVM methods developed here;
HT-1080 cells expressing H2b–EGFP or b1-tubulin–TagRFP
gave comparable images.
To test our ability to discriminate morphologies associated
with drug-induced perturbations, HeLa cells in culture were
pretreated with 2 drugs that induce morphologically distinct
mitotic arrests, injected into DSCs, and imaged (Fig. 2F and G).
Ptx-treated mitotic cells exhibited distributed rosettes of microtubules and scattered chromosomes (Fig. 2F), whereas K5Itreated cells (36) exhibited characteristic monopolar spindles
(Fig. 2G). Our ability to robustly distinguish the 2 different
mitotic arrest phenotypes shows that IVM has sufficient resolution to discriminate between related but distinct mitotic defects.
As a more stringent test of resolution, U2OS cells expressing the
centromeric protein CENP-B fused to EGFP were imaged. In
either interphase (not shown) or mitotic cells, single CENP-B
spots (500 nm in size) were routinely resolved, which is
consistent with the calculated diffraction limited resolution
of our standard optics (250 nm). From these initial data,
normal and mitotic arrest structures appear identical in culture
and in vivo, and we conclude that our cell models and methods
will permit the identification of different mitotic spindle structures and the imaging of chromosomes, as condensed human
chromosomes are typically several microns in length.
To evaluate tubulin imaging as a drug response marker in
vivo, HT-1080 cells expressing b1-tubulin–TagRFP were used
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Without Ptx, normal interphase and
mitotic cells were observed. After 30 mg/kg Ptx treatment,
mitotic arrest with microtubule rosettes was observed in a
subset of cells, confirming drug delivery and drug action on
these cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C–E). Although tubulin
imaging allowed visualization of mitosis and confirmation of

www.aacrjournals.org

Ptx action, fluorescent histone H2b imaging reports on more
features of drug response, including mitotic spindle structures,
chromosome behavior, mitotic arrest and slippage, and cell
death, and was therefore used in all subsequent experiments.
High-dose Ptx effects
Because multiple mitotic structures and chromosomes
could be resolved in DSCs, we used IVM to assay PD (IPDM)
in HT-1080 xenograft tumors. Tumors in Ptx-treated (single
bolus of 30 mg/kg Ptx) mice showed few remaining tumors
cells at day 17 (Supplementary Fig. S2A–D), in contrast to the
vigorous tumors in saline-injected mice (not shown), indicating our model is highly sensitive to Ptx. Time-lapse z-series
were collected at multiple random locations to reveal details
of mitosis before and after drug. Time-lapse imaging was
limited to 4 hours to minimize stress on the animals. Pre–
drug treatment, we observed many examples of normal mitosis, but almost no examples of apoptosis (Supplementary
Movie 2). The average duration of mitosis was 1 hour 6
minutes  6 minutes, which is remarkably comparable with
these cells in culture, 1 hour 18 minutes  13 minutes.
Nineteen hours post–Ptx treatment, the mitotic index was
noticeably increased and cells that entered mitosis during the
time-lapse imaging remained arrested (Fig. 3A–E; Supplementary Movie 3). Few cells died during mitotic arrest (not shown),
and no cells divided. Arrested cells often slipped from mitotic
arrest and became multinucleated (Fig. 3F–J). Multinucleated
cells did not reenter mitosis but did die sometimes (Fig. 3B–E,
I, and J; Supplementary Movies 3 and 4). The morphology of
cell death, during mitosis or from a multinucleated state,
resembled apoptosis, with chromatin condensation into multiple foci. Apoptotic bodies initially increased after Ptx treatment (not shown) but did not accumulate over time,
presumably due to macrophage clearance. The 2 image

sequences in Figure 3A–E and F to J are from the same tumor,
illustrating how cell populations in the same tumor can be
imaged repeatedly over time to capture the dynamics of drug
response.
The Ptx response was quantified by measuring mitotic and
multinucleated index as a function of time (Fig. 3K). Mitotic
index increased from about 1.0% pre–Ptx treatment to about
7% maximum at 24 hours and then declined, reproducibly
falling below baseline and reaching 0 at 168 hours (Fig. 3K).
The multinucleated index increased, peaked later than the
mitotic index, and reached higher levels (17%) presumably
because multinucleation is persistent, lasting days in some
cases, whereas mitotic arrest is transient, lasting hours
(Fig. 3K). To compare PD measures in vivo and in culture,
we scored Ptx effects on HT-1080 cells in culture by continuous time-lapse imaging (21). The control pre–Ptx mitotic
index was approximately 7% in culture (Fig. 3L) and at
saturating Ptx concentrations (100 nmol/L), mitotic arrest
peaked at 24 hours, with approximately 75% arrest. By 48
hours Ptx treatment, more than 90% of cells were dead
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). In contrast to the situation in
tumors, approximately 95% of mitosis-arrested cells in culture
initiated apoptosis without slipping from mitosis and only
about 5% slipped into the multinucleated G1 state before dying
(Supplementary Fig. S3; Supplementary Movie 5). Death

directly from mitotic arrest is characteristic of apoptosis
sensitive cells in culture (37).
Mitotic defects at low Ptx concentrations
To test whether IPDM could resolve subtle mitotic
defects, including chromosome missegregation and multipolar mitoses, and to explore the utility of morphology as a
quantitative PD marker, we also examined lower Ptx doses.
At 1.2 mg/kg, most mitotic cells showed no morphologic
defects (n ¼ 199). At 3 mg/kg, mitotic cells appeared normal
in single, static images. Time-lapse imaging, however,
revealed frequent defects. Mitosis often required more than
2 hours to complete, significantly longer than in untreated
tumors (1 hour). Figure 4A–C (Supplementary Movie 6)
shows a representative cell in which the metaphase spindle
took abnormally long (>2 hours) to assemble and a chromosome–chromosome pair failed to align properly (Fig. 4D,
arrow, inset). Several stretched, lagging chromosomes were
also evident at anaphase (Fig. 4E–G; Supplementary Movie
6). These defects in chromosome segregation indicate
abnormalities in kinetochore attachment and are frequently
observed in cultured cells at low Ptx concentrations (31, 32).
These data clearly show that time-lapse IPDM can reveal
time-dependent mitotic phenotypes that are missed in single, static images.

The mitotic phenotype at 3 mg/kg was mitotic delay and
lagging chromosomes, so we increased the dose to 6 mg/kg to
test whether we could induce spindle multipolarity as
observed in culture at medium concentrations. In mice
exposed to 6 mg/kg Ptx and imaged 2 to 4 hours after dosing,
dividing cells entered anaphase frequently with lagging chromosomes, sometimes resulting in daughter cells with micro-

nuclei (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Movie 7). By 24 hours, the
mitotic index was increased and many mitotic cells were
multipolar, with some cells dividing into 3 or more daughters
(Fig. 5B; Supplementary Movie 8). These data suggest that the
effective concentration of Ptx in tumor cells increased and
remained high from 2 to 24 hours, consistent with previous PK
data (27). There appeared to be considerable cell-to-cell

mg/kg Ptx was used. A, after 1
hour 30 minutes Ptx treatment, a
late prometaphase cell was
imaged. This cell enters anaphase
and initially appeared normal.
Lagging chromosomes (arrows,
inset) were present that
subsequently resulted in
micronucleus formation (arrows,
insets, Supplementary Movie 7).
B, multipolar mitosis occurs after 6
mg/kg Ptx. At 26 hours Ptx
treatment, time lapse of random
areas was done. See
Supplementary Movie 8. Three
cells (1, 2, and 3) are initially
mitotic. By 28 hours, cell 1 is
multipolar whereas cells 2 and 3
are arrested. Cell 1 underwent
multipolar anaphase, cell 2
progressed toward a multipolar
alignment, and cell 3 remained
arrested. High magnification of
cell 2 at 30 hours 20 minutes Ptx
shows unaligned chromosomes.
Note: It required more than 4
hours for cell 2 to become
multipolar, indicating mitotic
progression is delayed. Timelapse z-series acquired at 25,

Figure 6. IPDM can be used to establish Ptx-PD over time and dose, and Ptx response is significantly different in vivo than in culture. A, phenotypic
responses are color coded in response to increasing doses of Ptx at 2, 6, and 24 hours treatment. The majority of cells remained mononucleated
during the first 24 hours and both 6 and 30 mg/kg showed increasing multinucleated and mitotic indices. To establish PD of Ptx on mitosis, mitotic
profiles were further separated to include bipolar, multipolar, and arrested phenotypes. As the percentage of bipolar cells decreases, the multipolar and
arrested phenotypes increase. For 1.2 mg/kg Ptx, a small increase in multipolarity and arrest occurred at 24 hours. For 6 mg/kg, by 6 hours, more than
30% of cells were multipolar, which remained at 15% at 24 hours; the percentage of arrested cells steadily increased at 24 hours. Unlike 1.2 and 6 mg/kg,
30 mg/kg did not accumulate or maintain significant multipolarity. After 2 hours, the percentage of multipolar cells sharply decreased and all mitotic
stages displayed an arrested phenotype. B, summary of in-culture and in-tumor responses to saturating Ptx concentrations.

variability in tumors at 6 mg/kg, in contrast to the uniform
mitotic arrest observed at 30 mg/kg.
Mitotic morphology as a PD marker
We used IPDM to quantify mitotic morphology as a function of dose and time up to 24 hours to determine whether
phenotype could be used as an effective measure of the Ptx
concentration (Fig. 6A). Normal mitosis decreased and mitotic
abnormalities increased with dose and time. Interestingly,
multinucleated cells and multipolar mitoses peaked at intermediate doses (6 mg/kg) and times (6 hours), showing that
these morphologies report on exposure of cells to nonsaturating drug concentrations. For high-dose Ptx, multipolar
mitoses peak at 2 hours, indicating that Ptx had not reached
saturation, but it had by 6 hours, as all mitotic cells were then
arrested (Fig. 6A). The PD of Ptx during the first 24 hours in
saturating conditions was dramatically different in tumors
than in culture (Supplementary Fig. S4). In culture, by 2 hours,
all mitotic cells showed the arrested phenotype, the mitotic
index increased rapidly, and there was little multinucleation
and by 24 hours 70% of cells were dead. In tumors, there was a

4614

delay in mitotic arrest phenotype, the mitotic index increased,
but remained comparatively low, and there was little death by
24 hours. These data show that Ptx PD is significantly different
in these tumors than in culture and IPDM can be used to
characterize the Ptx concentration experienced by individual
cells in tumors over time.

Discussion
Using optimized microscopic and animal preparations, we
show that normal mitosis and antimitotic drug responses can
be visualized at subcellular (500 nm) spatial resolution in
vivo (Fig. 2). The data show that the power of IPDM to reveal
detailed aspects of mitosis, mitotic abnormalities, and drug
PD in tumors. These methods should be equally applicable to
any organ that can be imaged using a window chamber or
exteriorized, and perhaps to internal organs/tumors, using
multiphoton microscopy. Furthermore, the general methods
can be tailored using specific probes to study many different
pathways in disease and cell biology in vivo. Using IPDM, we
gained new insights into Ptx PD in a tumor model that are

summarized in Figure 6B for the saturating 30 mg/kg dose,
wherein we compare the effects of continuous exposure to
saturating Ptx concentrations on the same cells in culture. The
lower peak of mitotic arrest in tumors is consistent with a
slower proliferation rate, but because the peak mitotic arrest
occurred at 24 hours in both cases, the cell-cycle transit time
for cells that commit to divide must be similar. The low-peak
mitotic arrest in HT-1080 tumors resembles the response seen
in other mouse cancer models by histology of tumor sections
and in human breast cancers by histology of fine needle
aspirates (16, 29, 38). Mitosis-arrested cells tended to slip in
tumors and to die directly from mitotic arrest in culture.
Presumably, this reflects enhanced prosurvival signaling in the
tumor, which allows slippage to win the kinetic competition
with apoptosis induction (19, 39).
PK studies of Ptx in mice showed that upon bolus i.v.
injection at 40 mg/kg, plasma levels peaked within 5 minutes
(27, 34) but remained detectable for 14 days or more (34). Ptx
has also been reported to be detectable within minutes of
injection in an s.c. lung xenograft, and several tissues reach its
peak concentration by approximately 2 hours and remain
detectable in these tissues for 14 days or more (34). Our PD
data for 30 mg/kg Ptx agree well with these PK data as we
observed mitotic arrest, indicating effective Ptx reaching the
tumors by 2 hours (Fig. 6, images not shown). The published
half-life of Ptx (based on concentration determined using
tritylated Ptx and high-performance liquid chromatography)
in mouse tissues and lung xenograft tumors after a 40 mg/kg
dose was reported as approximately 50 to 70 hours (34), and
our PD data at 30 mg/kg show that Ptx remained maximally
effective at 72 hours, as all mitotic cells at this time were
arrested. Furthermore, at 72 hours Ptx remains high in the
tumors because if washed away, mitotic cells would be either
normal or multipolar, although this was not observed. From 72
to 168 hours post–Ptx treatment, we noted a dramatic
decrease in mitotic cells (Fig. 3K) and did not trap any dividing
cells with a second dose of 30 mg/kg Ptx at 168 hours after the
first dose (not shown). These observations suggest that the
remaining tumor cells are no longer proliferating despite the
fact that they are mostly mononucleated, implying that they
have not divided in Ptx. Ptx either damaged the remaining
cells in a manner that is not evident from H2b–EGFP imaging
or the tumor microenvironment has changed so that it no
longer supports proliferation. This change is long-lasting in
that xenograft tumors showed significant regression by
2 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S2). Consistent with these ideas,
Symmans and colleagues found some human breast cancers

that showed only a modest increase in mitotic index and little
cell death in the first 48 hours after Ptx treatment, but these
tumors later converted to a "sustained apoptotic response"
16). Elucidating how a modest mitotic arrest results in minimal cell killing in some tumors but translates into a sustained
response with significant tumor clearance in others could be
useful for improving antimitotic therapy.
The dose- and time-dependent effects revealed by IPDM
show its potential to report on single-cell biomarkers. Tumors
are genetically and environmentally heterogeneous, and individual cancer cells can respond differently to drugs even in
culture (19, 21, 40). Cell-to-cell and intratumor heterogeneity
are likely in tumors. Thus, PD biomarkers with subcellular
resolution may prove very valuable in understanding drug
responses. Furthermore, on the basis of our results with lowdose Ptx, it should be possible to visualize and quantify
chromosome segregation defects that contribute to cancer
progression in a tumor context, using IPDM, which is unique
in its ability to reveal a dynamic response to drugs at the
single-cell level and allows for the use of many different
probes, including fluorescent dyes, particles, and antibodies,
and probes for specific activities including kinases and proteases (1, 12, 41). In this study, a chromatin marker allowed us
to study normal and abnormal mitotic progression in real time
at the resolution of single chromosomes, to monitor single
cells responding to drug and undergoing apoptosis, and to
establish drug PD over dose and time. The features of IPDM
create a powerful technique with a bright future.
