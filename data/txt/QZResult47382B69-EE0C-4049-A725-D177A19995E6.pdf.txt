Cancer is a disease of aging, and aged cancer patients have a poorer prognosis. This may be due to
accumulated cellular damage, decreases in adaptive immunity, and chronic inflammation.
However, the effects of the aged microenvironment on tumor progression have been largely
1 4
unexplored. Since dermal fibroblasts can have profound impacts on melanoma progression – we
examined whether age-related changes in dermal fibroblasts could drive melanoma metastasis and
response to targeted therapy. We find that aged fibroblasts secrete a Wnt antagonist, sFRP2, which
activates a multi-step signaling cascade in melanoma cells that results in a decrease in β-catenin
and MITF, and ultimately the loss of a key redox effector, APE1. Loss of APE1 attenuates the
response of melanoma cells to ROS-induced DNA damage, rendering them more resistant to
targeted therapy (vemurafenib). Age-related increases in sFRP2 also augment both angiogenesis
and metastasis of melanoma cells. These data provide an integrated view of how fibroblasts in the
aged microenvironment contribute to tumor progression, offering new paradigms for the design of
therapy for the elderly.

To determine whether the aged microenvironment promotes melanoma progression,
5
Yumm1.7 cells, derived from the BrafV600E/Cdkn2a−/−/Pten−/− mouse model of melanoma ,
were injected into 8-week old mice (young) or 52-week old mice (aged). Tumors grow
slowly in aged mice (Figure 1a), but are more aggressive, with increased angiogenesis
(Figure 1b) and lung metastases (Figure 1c, Extended Data 1a). This is consistent with
observations that melanoma cells switch between proliferative and invasive states, termed
678
“phenotype switching”, which depends on changes in Wnt signaling and MITF , , . We have
shown that phenotype switching to a metastatic, therapy-resistant state is induced by stresses
9
such as hypoxia .

invasion – and therapy resistance . Dermal fibroblasts senesce during aging , and
12
senescent fibroblasts can promote tumor invasion . To determine whether fibroblasts from
normally-aged skin could promote tumor progression, we used dermal fibroblasts from
young (<35) and aged (>55) healthy donors from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of
13
Aging (Extended Data Table 1). Proliferation is initially unaffected (Extended Data 1b),
but aged fibroblasts senesce more rapidly than young fibroblasts (Extended Data 1c).
Organotypic skin reconstructs were built using two melanoma cell lines (WM35 and
WM793) and 3 young or 3 aged fibroblast lines, which persisted equally in the skin
reconstructs as demonstrated by smooth muscle actin staining (Extended Data 1d).
Melanoma cell invasion was increased, but proliferation was decreased in reconstructs built
with aged fibroblasts (Figure 1d, e, Extended Data 1e). To assess the effects of secreted
factors, melanoma cells were exposed to conditioned media from aged or young fibroblasts.
Aged fibroblast media decreased melanoma cell proliferation (Figure 1f, Extended Data 1f),
and increased invasion as measured by spheroid and Boyden chamber invasion assays
(Figure 1g,h Extended Data 1g). These data indicate that secreted factors from fibroblasts
play critical roles in phenotype switching in melanoma cells.
A key player in phenotype switching is β-catenin, which drives proliferation and inhibits
14 15
invasion of melanoma cells , . An inhibitor of β-catenin, sFRP2, was significantly
increased in the secretome of aged fibroblasts (Figure 2a). In both spheroid and Boyden

Chamber assays, media from young fibroblasts treated with recombinant sFRP2 (rsFRP2)
increased invasion of melanoma cells (Figure 2b, Extended Data 2a) and media from aged
fibroblasts treated with α-sFRP2 inhibited melanoma cell invasion (Figure 2c, Extended
Data 2c). In vivo, sFRP2 was increased in sera from aged mice, and these levels could be
nearly attained in young mice by intravenous injection of rsFRP2 (Figure 2d). Increasing
serum sFRP2 in young mice increased metastasis of Yumm1.7 to the lung (Figure 2e) and
increased angiogenesis in subcutaneous tumors (Figure 2f, Extended Data 2c,d). Tumors in
α-sFRP2 treated mice showed impaired angiogenesis (Figure 2f, Extended Data 2e,f).
However, α-sFRP2 treated aged mice succumbed to a lethal inflammation (Extended Data
16
3), an outcome previously observed in aged immune-competent mice treated with α-PD1 .

Author Manuscript

We next explored the significance of sFRP2 effects on β-catenin expression and activity.
Treatment of melanoma cells with rsFRP2 inhibited β-catenin expression (Figure 2g), and βcatenin was decreased in aged human skin (Figure 2h, Extended Data 4a) and in melanoma
cells treated with aged fibroblast media (Extended Data 4b,c). Yumm1.7 tumors in aged
mice exhibited decreased β-catenin and increased sFRP2 (Figure 2i), effects reversed by
treatment of aged mice with α-sFRP2 (Figure 2j). Knockdown of β-catenin in young
fibroblasts increased their sFRP2 secretion (Figure 2k), which reduced β-catenin and
increased invasion in melanoma cells (Figure 2l, Extended Data 4d). These data suggest that
sFRP2 present in the aged microenvironment may contribute to melanoma metastasis
through suppression of β-catenin in melanoma cells.

The loss of β-catenin permits oxidative stress in hematopoietic stem cells . We
hypothesized that the same might occur in melanoma cells, via MITF, which is activated by
18
β-catenin . MITF modulates responses to reactive oxygen species (ROS) by increasing the
19
redox effector APE1 (REF-1) . We predicted that age-induced loss of β-catenin might
dysregulate the MITF/APE1 redox pathway. Indeed, melanoma cells exposed to aged
fibroblast media have decreased β-catenin, MITF, and APE1 (Figure 3a). APE1 expression is
lower in aged human skin (Extended Data 5a), and in Yumm1.7 tumors in aged mice (Figure
3b). Loss of APE1 reduces cellular responses to ROS. ROS activity is increased in aged
fibroblasts (Figure 3c), partly due to the fact that aged fibroblasts secrete lower levels of
superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3), and peroxiredoxin 6, which scavenge free radicals
(Extended Data 5b,c). A marker of oxidative stress, 8-oxo-dG, was increased in aged but not
young skin (Extended Data 5d) and in tumors in aged mice (Figure 3d). Knockdown of
APE1 in melanoma cells increases ROS activity, especially upon exposure to aged fibroblast
media (Figure 3e,f, Extended Data 5e). We hypothesized that this loss of ability to respond
to ROS in an aged environment is partly due to sFRP2 downregulation of APE1. Treating
young mice with rsFRP2 increases 8-oxo-dG in Yumm1.7 tumors (Figure 3g), while
depleting sFRP2 in aged mice decreases 8-oxo-dG (Figure 3g). Together, these data indicate
that sFRP2 increases oxidative stress by inhibiting β-catenin and, ultimately, APE1 in
melanoma cells (Figure 3h).
Our model indicates that loss of APE1 due to age-induced sFRP2 should render melanoma
cells sensitive to DNA damage (Extended Data 6a). Accordingly, microarray analysis reveals
an increased DNA damage response signature in melanoma cells exposed to aged fibroblasts
(Extended Data 6b,c). The DNA damage markers γH2AX and 53BP1 are increased in

melanoma cells grown in aged mice (Figure 4a), or exposed to aged fibroblast media (Figure
4b) or in skin reconstructs built with aged fibroblasts (Extended Data 7a,b). Melanoma cells
exposed to aged media also had increased levels of DNA damage (Figure 4c, Extended Data
7c). Pre-treating aged fibroblasts with the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) decreased
ROS (Extended Data 7d) and, subsequently, γH2AX in melanoma cells (Figure 4d).
Conversely, knockdown of the anti-oxidant SOD3 in young fibroblasts increased γH2AX in
melanoma cells (Figure 4e, Extended Data 7e), suggesting that age-induced DNA damage
could be reversed by inhibiting ROS activity.

Author Manuscript

We next queried the contribution of the sFRP2 → APE1 signaling axis to ROS-induced
DNA damage. Loss of APE1 increases γH2AX (Figure 4f). In melanoma cells, γH2AX also
increases with treatment of rsFRP2, and decreases in cells where sFRP2 is deleted (Figure
4g, Extended Data 7f,g). In vivo, 53BP1 increases in Yumm1.7 tumors in young mice
treated with rsFRP2, and decreases in aged mice treated with α–sFRP2 (Figure 4h). Aged
melanoma patients (over 55) had significantly higher serum levels of sFRP2 (p=0.0084) than
young patients (under 40) (Figure 4i). The key players in the pathway outlined in Figure 3h
were altered in aged melanoma patients: increased sFRP2 (in both fibroblasts and melanoma
cells), decreased β-catenin, MITF and APE1, and increased 8-oxo-dG and 53BP1 (Figure 4j,
Extended Data 8). These data confirmed our observations from both human cell line and
mouse data.

Increases in ROS , and decreases in β-catenin , and MITF have been associated with
increased resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Accordingly, spheroids treated with young medium
were more sensitive to PLX4720 (vemurafenib) than those exposed to aged medium
(Extended Data 9a). In vivo, Yumm1.7 tumors in young mice responded to PLX4720 more
robustly than tumors in aged mice (Figure 5a,b). Melanoma cells first exposed to media
from young fibroblasts treated with H2O2 (to increase ROS), developed resistance to
PLX4720 (Figure 5c). However, when we first exposed melanoma cells to media from aged
fibroblasts pre-treated with NAC, the melanoma cells died, whether treated with NAC alone
or NAC + PLX4720 (Figure 5d, e). This indicated that vemurafenib-resistant cells in an aged
microenvironment might be uniquely sensitive to anti-oxidants. This finding is especially
exciting in light of recent data that indicate that anti-oxidants are effective in treating KRAS
24
and BRAF mutant colon cancers .
Phenotype switching resulting in the loss of β-catenin has also been shown to contribute to
9 22
resistance to vemurafenib , . β-catenin expression is elevated in sensitive vs. resistant cell
lines (Extended Data 9b). Further, patients with clinical response to vemurafenib (over 30%
tumor reduction as measured by RECIST) had higher levels of β-catenin than those with
muted response (Figure 5f, g). Yumm1.7 cells are sensitive to PLX4720, and knocking down
Ctnnb1 in these cells significantly increased their resistance to PLX4720 (Extended Data
9c). To determine whether sFRP2 alters the response of melanoma cells to vemurafenib,
rsFRP2 was administered i.v. to tumor-bearing young mice, prior to, and during PLX4720
exposure. β-catenin was decreased in the skin of sFRP2-treated mice (Extended Data 9d),
and treated mice rapidly developed resistance to PLX4720 (Figure 5h). Depletion of sFRP2
in aged mice began to re-sensitize tumors to PLX4720 (Figure 5i, Extended Data 9e), but a

firm conclusion cannot be drawn from these data due to the premature death of the mice as
described earlier.

Since these data suggested that response to BRAF inhibitors may be attenuated in aged
patients, we compared the age of patients (n=79) at starting treatment to percent tumor
reduction (RECIST) post-vemurafenib. Using age categories of under 35 and over 55, we
saw a shift from a 41% (mean) response by RECIST in young patients to 25% (mean)
response in patients over 55. Numbers of young patients were too low to achieve statistical
significance. We therefore refocused our efforts on identifying an age cutoff where a
statistically significant difference could be observed. We observed a striking separation
(p=0.016) between patients under 65yo and over 65yo (~25.6% reduction in tumor burden in
aged compared to ~47% in the young, Figure 5j). The continous relationship between
response and age was highly significant (Spearman’s correlation coefficient of r=0.243,
p=0.03) (Extended Data 9f). However, in this small sample set, the relationship between
patient age, sFRP2 and RECIST was not significant. Together, these data suggest that
sFRP2-induced β-catenin loss not only promotes invasion, but also renders melanoma cells
more senstive to oxidative stress. New data from Cantley and colleagues show that therapyrefractory, BRAF mutant cells are uniquely sensitive to anti-oxidants, specifically Vitamin
24
C . Our data support these observations, and suggest that aged patients may uniquely
benefit from anti-oxidant therapy.

In our experiments, genetically identical cells had a very different outcome in terms of
metastasis and therapy response when placed in an aged microenvironment. In the skin,
benign melanocytic lesions (nevi) bear mutational changes that do not result in
tumorigenesis, until cells accumulate further changes during aging. These changes may be
genetic, such as loss of p16, but they may also be epigenetic, and age-related epigenetic
25 27
changes also contribute to tumorigenesis – . What drives the initiation of these epigenetic
changes is not well understood, and it is possible that the aged secretome contributes to this
process. While overall results were consistent among different fibroblasts of similar ages, we
did observe some phenotypic differences. These may be attributable to factors such as
tanning, as indeed, the exposure of melanoma cells to UV irradiation not only drives tumor
28
29
promotion , but also metastasis . Our data suggest that, as the general population ages,
new efforts must be made to understand and treat cancer in an age-appropriate manner.

Fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml
penicillin and streptomycin and 4 mM L-glutamine. Keratinocytes were maintained in
keratinocyte SFM supplemented with human recombinant Epidermal Growth Factor 1–53
(EGF 1–53) and Bovine Pituitary Extract (BPE) (Invitrogen). Cell lines were cultured at
37°C in 5% CO2 and the medium was replaced as required. Cell stocks were fingerprinted
using AmpFLSTR® Identifiler® PCR Amplification Kit from Life Technologies TM at The
Wistar Institute Genomics Facility. Although it is desirable to compare the profile to the
tissue or patient of origin, our cell lines were established over the course of 40 years, long
before acquisition of normal control DNA was routinely performed. However, each STR
profile is compared to our internal database of over 200 melanoma cell lines, as well as
control lines, such as HeLa and 293T. STR profiles are available upon request. Cell culture
supernatants were mycoplasma tested using a Lonza MycoAlert assay at the University of

Author Manuscript

Organotypic 3D skin reconstructs were generated as previously described . In each insert,
6.4 × 104 fibroblasts were plated on top of the acellular layer (BD #355467 and Falcon
#353092) and incubated for 45 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator. DMEM
containing 10% FBS was added to each well of the tissue culture trays and incubated for 4
days. Reconstructs were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C in HBSS containing 1% dialyzed
FBS (wash media). Washing media was removed and replaced with reconstruct media I.
Keratinocytes (4.17 × 105) and melanoma cells (8.3 × 104) were added to the inside of each
insert. Media was changed every other day until day 18 when reconstructs were harvested,
fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained. Quantification of the
invasion was performed using ImageJ software (available at http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/;
developed by Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD)
3D Spheroid Assays
Tissue culture-treated 96-well plates were coated with 50 µl 1.5% Difco Agar Noble (Becton
Dickinson). Melanoma cells were seeded at 5 × 103 cells / well and allowed to form
spheroids over 72 h. Spheroids were harvested and embedded as previously described using
collagen type I (GIBCO, #A1048301). For spheroids incubated with fibroblast conditioned
media, fibroblasts were seeded onto 75 cm2 flasks at 7–9×105/flask depending on growth
rate. Sixteen hours later, media was replaced and incubated for 72 h. Media from young
fibroblasts was combined and media from aged fibroblasts was combined. This conditioned
media was added to the top of the collagen plug containing the spheroids. Quantitation of
invasive surface area was performed using NIS Elements Advanced Research software.

Live/dead staining
Spheroids were generated and embedded as described above. Spheroids were stained using
LIVE/DEAD® Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (L3224, Invitrogen). Briefly, spheroids were
washed with PBS and stained with calcein AM/Ethidium homodimer-1. The dyes were
diluted in PBS and 300µl of the solution was added on the spheroid wells for 1 hour at 37°C.
The spheroids were washed in PBS and imaged using Nikon TE2000 Inverted Microscope.

Boyden Chamber Invasion assays

Author Manuscript

Matrigel (BD Biosciences, #354234) was diluted in PBS (1:3000 dilution). 150µl of this
mixture was pipetted into each insert of the invasion assay plate (Corning, #3422). The plate
was incubated at 37°C for 2 hours and then dried at room temperature overnight under
sterile conditions. Melanoma cells were pre-treated for 48 hours in 6 well plates. After 48
hours, the cells were harvested and 1.5×105 cells were added to each transwell. High
concentration serum media (RPMI with 20% FCS, Tumor growth media with 10% FCS) was
added to the outside (bottom) of the well. The plates were incubated at 37°C until cells had
migrated to the bottom of the well. The migrated cells were fixed in 95% ice-cold methanol
and stained with crystal violet (0.5%) for 10 minutes. The stain was washed and the wells
were left to dry. Cells were imaged and quantified using ImageJ software.
Cellular Proliferation assays
In a 24 well plate, 5000 cells in triplicate were plated per day of measurement. Every 2–3
days, cells were counted using hemocytometer and the total cell number in the well was
recorded and plotted on Graphpad/Prism.
Immunofluorescence (IF)

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded onto glass cover slips at 1–4×104 cells /well, and incubated overnight.
After treatment, cells were fixed using 95% methanol. Primary antibodies were diluted as
stated above in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed in PBS
and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:2000, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room
temperature. Cells were then washed in PBS and mounted in Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent
containing DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were captured on a Leica TCS SP5 II scanning laser
confocal system.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Author Manuscript

All antibodies are described in the Supplementary Information. Patient samples were
collected under IRB exemption approval for protocol #EX21205258-1. Paraffin embedded
sections were rehydrated through a xylene and alcohol series, rinsed in H2O and washed in
PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed using target retrieval buffer (Vector Labs,
Burlingame, CA) and steamed for 20 min. Samples were then blocked in a peroxidase
blocking buffer (Thermo Scientific) for 15 min, followed by Protein block (Thermo
Scientific) for 5 min, and incubated in appropriate primary antibody diluted in antibody
diluent (S0809, Dako) at 4°C overnight in a humidified chamber. For mouse samples to be
incubated with anti-mouse antibody, samples were blocked for 1 hour in Mouse on Mouse
(M.O.M.™) Blocking Reagent (MKB-2213, Vector Labs). Following washing in PBS,
samples were incubated in biotinylated anti-rabbit or polyvalent secondary antibody
(Thermo Scientific) followed by streptavidin-HRP solution at room temperature for 20 min.
Samples were then washed in PBS and incubated in 3-Amino-9-Ethyl-l-Carboazole (AEC)

mounted in Aquamount.
Western Blotting
Total protein lysate (50–65 µg) was run on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis Tris gel (Invitrogen).
Proteins were then transferred onto PVDF membrane using an iBlot system, and blocked in
5% milk/TBST for 1 hour. All primary antibodies were diluted in 5% milk/TBST and
incubated over night at 4°C. The membranes were washed in TBST and probed with the
corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (0.2–0.02 µg/ml of anti-mouse,
streptavidin, or anti-rabbit). Proteins were visualized using, ECL prime (Amersham,
Uppsala, Sweden), or Luminata Crescendo (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
Lentiviral infection

Author Manuscript

All clones used are described in the Supplementary Information. All shRNA was obtained
from the TRC shRNA library available through the Molecular Screening Facility at The
Wistar Institute. Lentiviral production was carried out as described in the protocol developed
by the TRC library (Broad Institute). Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with shRNA
vector and lentiviral packaging plasmids (pCMV-dR8.74psPAX2, pMD2.G). The
supernatant containing virus was harvested at 36 and 60 hours, combined and filtered
through a 0.45µm filter. For transduction, the cells were layered overnight with lentivirus
containing 8µg/ml polybrene. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 hours and then
selected using 1µg/ml puromycin.
MTS Assays

Author Manuscript

Cells (1.5×103/well) were plated in a 96 well plate and treated with PLX4720. After 48 h,
cells were incubated with MTS dye (20 µl/well) for 2 h. Absorbance was determined at 490
nm using an EL800 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The percent cell
proliferation was calculated by converting the experimental absorbance to percentage of
control and plotted vs drug concentration. The values were then analyzed using a nonlinear
dose-response analysis in GraphPad Prism.
Illumina oligonucleotide microarray

Author Manuscript

Transcriptional profiling was determined using Illumina Sentrix BeadChips. Total RNA was
used to generate biotin-labeled cRNA using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit.
In short, 0.5 µg of total RNA was first converted into single-stranded cDNA with reverse
transcriptase using an oligo-dT primer containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter site and
then copied to produce double-stranded cDNA molecules. The double stranded cDNA was
cleaned and concentrated with the supplied columns and used in an overnight in-vitro
transcription reaction where single-stranded RNA (cRNA) was generated incorporating
biotin-16-UTP. A total of 0.75 µg of biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized at 58°C for 16 h to
Illumina's Sentrix Human HT-12 v3 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Each
BeadChip has around 48,000 transcripts with approximately 15-fold redundancy. The arrays
were washed, blocked and the labeled cRNA was detected by staining with streptavidin-Cy3.

Microarray expression data was quantile normalized and probes that showed low expression
levels (detection p-value>0.05) across all samples were removed from the analysis.
Expression values for each cell line were tested separately in multiple linear regression
model with fibroblast age and experiment batches as predictor variables. Matlab v.8.0
“regress” function was used to calculated p-values for each probe for association with
fibroblast age. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was estimated using Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure and only probes that showed FDR<5% in all 3 cell lines were considered
significant. Heatmap was plotted using average expression values for 3 groups of age
(young, middle and aged) normalized to aged group (100%).

1.7 (1×106 cells/100 µl PBS) or B16F10 (2.5×105/100 µl PBS) were injected into the tail
vein of C57BL6 mice. Alternatively, Yumm1.7 cells were overexpressed with mCherry
plasmid (pLU-EF1-MCS-mcherry) using lentivirus. The cells were sorted for mcherry and
1×106 cells/100 µl PBS were injected into tail vein of young C57BL6 mice. After 4 weeks,
the mice were euthanized, lungs were harvested and metastases counted. Lungs were fixed
in paraffin and stained with H&E. Alternatively, lungs were harvested and imaged for
presence of metastatic melanoma cells using Perkin-Elmer IVIS 200 whole body imager. For
experiments requiring recombinant sFRP2, mouse recombinant sFRP2 (1169-FR-025/CF,
R&D) was diluted in 50µl PBS and injected at a concentration of 200ng per mouse twice a
week. The levels of sFRP2 were monitored by submandibular blood withdrawal every two
weeks.
In vivo PLX4720 assay

Author Manuscript

All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) (IACUC #112503X_0) and were performed in an Association for the Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) accredited facility. YUMM1.7
(2.5 × 105 cells) were suspended in Matrigel (500 µg/ml) and injected subcutaneously into
young (6 week) and aged (52 week) C57/BL6 mice (Taconic). When resulting tumors
reached 200 mm3, mice were fed either AIN-76A chow or AIN-76A chow containing 417
mg/kg PLX4720. Tumor sizes were measured every 3–4 days using digital calipers, and
tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula: volume = 0.5 × (length ×
width2). Time-to-event (survival) was determined by a 5-fold increase in baseline volume
(~1000 mm3) and was limited by the development of skin necrosis. Upon the occurrence of
necrosis, mice were euthanized. For subsequent experiments involving sFRP2 manipulation,
Yumm1.7 cells overexpressing mCherry were used. 1×106 cells were suspended in PBS and
subcutaneously injected into either 6-week-old or 52-week-old male C57/BL6 mice

(Taconic). For treatment with recombinant sFRP2, the mice were injected with recombinant
protein (200ng/ml) through the tail vein every 2 days as described above. For the
experiments performed with sFRP2 blocking antibody (clone 80.8.6, #MABC539, EMD
Millipore), the mice were treated with 1mg/kg antibody (either sFRP2 or isotype control,
Biolegend, #400264) once per week via tail vein injections.
Comet Assay

Author Manuscript

WM35 and FS5 melanoma cells were seeded in 12 well plates and treated with conditioned
media for 48 hours. The cells were harvested in ice cold PBS. The comet assay was
performed using CometSlides (Trevigen). Briefly, 75µl of a 2×105 cell suspension was
mixed with 500µl 1% low melting point agarose. 50µl of cell/agarose mixture was dropped
into the wells and allowed to solidify. Slides were incubated in lysis buffer (1.2M NaCl,
100nM EDTA, 0.1% Sarkosyl, pH10.0) for 1h at 4°C. Slides were then electrophoresed at
25V for 12 min in alkaline buffer (0.03M NaOH, 2mM EDTA, pH8.0). After fixation in
70% ethanol, comets were visualized by staining with SYBR Green (Fisher). The extent of
DNA damage was measured as the artificial Olive Moment using Cometscore software
downloaded from http://www.tritekcorp.com.
ROS Activation Assay

Author Manuscript

5000 melanoma cells were seeded in a 96 well plate in triplicate. The cells were then treated
with conditioned media from young and aged fibroblasts as well as DMEM as control.
Hydrogen peroxide was added at 1mM as control. After 72 hours, reactive oxygen species
were measured using Cell Meter™ Fluorimetric Intracellular Total ROS Activity Assay Kit
(#22901, AAT Bioquest, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The plates were
measured using the PerkinElmer EnVision Xcite Multilabel plate reader using the filters for
Ex/Em=520/605 nm. Alternatively, samples were imaged using PerkinElmer Operetta and
the fluorescent signal was quantified using Harmony 3.0 software. The cell number was
determined by Hoescht staining (Hoechst 33342, Invitrogen) and used to normalize the total
fluorescence obtained from ROS staining.
Topflash assay

Author Manuscript

Topflash vectors were obtained from Addgene (M51 Super 8× FOPFlash/TOPFlash mutant,
#12457; M50 Super 8× TOPFlash, 12456). WM35 cells were plated to achieve 70%
confluency in 6-well plates. Cells were co-transfected with pTK-RLuc (Green Renilla
Luciferase) along with either Topflash or Fopflash vectors. After 5 hours of transfection,
cells were treated as required. After 48h, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was
measured using Dual-Luciferase® Reporter (DLR™) Assay System (Promega, E1910). The
firefly luciferase signal from each well was normalized to its Renilla Luciferase signal.
Topflash/fopflash signal was determined from each treatment and graphed using Graphpad/
Prism.

Treatment with N-acetyl cysteine

Author Manuscript

N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was obtained from Sigma (A9165) and dissolved in sterile
dH2O (stock 1M). Cells were treated for 48h and analyzed. After optimization, 10mM final
concentration was used for subsequent experiments.
Cell Fractionation
Melanoma cells were seeded into T25 flasks and incubated for 72 hours with 6.5ml
conditioned fibroblast media prepared as described above. Cells were then washed in PBS,
harvested with TrypLE Express and fractionated using the cellular fractionation kit (NEPER, Fisher) as per manufacturer’s protocol. Cell lysates were then separated on an SDSPAGE gel and visualized using standard Western blotting procedures.
ELISA

Author Manuscript

Nunc™ MaxiSorp™ ELISA plates (ebiosciences, CA) were coated with 50µl of 3µg/ml
sFRP2 (#ab137560, abcam) overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed in PBS containing 0.1%
Tween and blocked in ELISA diluent (00-4202-56, ebiosciences, CA) for 2 hours. Serum
was diluted 1:100 before addition to the plates and incubated overnight at 4°C. Next day, the
plates were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween20 and incubated with detection antibody
(MAB6838, R&D systems, MN) for 1h at room temperature. Plates were washed and
incubated with secondary antibody for 1h. After washing, 100µl TMB (00-4201-56,
ebiosciences, CA) was added to the plates and incubated for 15 minutes. The reaction was
stopped using 50µl of 2N H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450nm.
β–galactosidase staining

Author Manuscript

Fibroblasts were plated into 12-well dishes, incubated for 48 h, washed with PBS and fixed
in 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde. Cells were then incubated in staining solution
(150mM NaCl, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 2mM MgCl2 (Sigma), 5mM K3Fe(CN)6 (Millipore),
5mM K4Fe(CN)6 (Millipore), 40mM Na2PO4 (Sigma) pH5.5, 20mg/ml X-gal (Applichem,
Darmstadt, Germany) at 37°C overnight. Stain was removed and cells were stored in 70%
glycerol before being imaged.
Quantitative PCR

Author Manuscript

All primers are listed in the Supplementary Information. Mouse tissue was snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen immediately after harvesting. 10mg of the lung tissue was homogenized and
RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) as described
previously. 1µg RNA was used to prepare cDNA using iscript DNA synthesis kit (#1708891,
Bio-Rad, CA). cDNA was diluted 1:5 before use for further reactions. Each 20µl well
reaction comprised of 10µl Power SYBR Green Master mix (4367659, Invitrogen), 1µl
primer mix (Final concentration 0.5µM) and 1µl cDNA. Standard curves were generated for
all primers and each set of primers were normalized to 18 Primer pair.
Statistical Analysis
For in vitro studies, a Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann Whitney) was
performed for two-group comparison. Estimate of variance was performed and parameters

for the t-test were adjusted accordingly using Welch’s correction. ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis
test with post-hoc Bonferroni's or Holm-Sidak’s adjusted p-values was used for multiple
comparisons. For dose response analysis, Spearman’s correlation was calculated. For in vivo
studies, the indicated sample size for each experiment was designed to have 80% power at a
two-sided alpha of 0.05 to detect a difference of large effect size about 1.25 between two
groups on a continuous measurement. The fold change in tumor volume at each time point
after treatment relative to baseline was calculated and then the fold change in treatment
group relative to age matched control group was used with a mixed-effect model to evaluate
the treatment effect between age groups. Stata 12.0 (StatCorp LP, College Station, TX,
USA) was used for data analysis for in vivo studies and human samples. For other
experiments, Graphpad/Prism6 was used for plotting graphs and statistical analysis.
Significance was designated as follows: *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; ***, p<0.001. Extended
statistical analyses for patient data are provided in the Supplementary Information.
