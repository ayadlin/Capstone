Abstract
The pan-PI3K inhibitors are one treatment option for triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC). However, this treatment is ineffective for unknown reasons. Here, we report
that aberrant expression of wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) and
activated WNT signals, which crosstalk with the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway
through GSK3β, plays the most critical role in resistance to pan-PI3K inhibitors in
TNBC cells. GDC-0941 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor that activates the WNT/beta-catenin
pathway in TNBC cells through stimulation of WNT secretion. GDC-0941-triggered
WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation was observed in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937
cells, which are TNBC cell lines showing aberrant WNT/beta-catenin activation, and
not in SKBR3 and MCF7 cells. This observation is further investigated in vivo. GDC0941 exhibited minimal tumor inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells, but it significantly
suppressed tumor growth in HER-positive SK-BR3 cells. In vivo mechanism study
revealed the activation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway by GDC-0941. A synergistic
effect was observed when combined treatment with GDC-0941 and the WNT inhibitor
LGK974 at low concentrations in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings indicated that
WNT pathway activation conferred resistance in TNBC cells treated with GDC-0941.
This resistance may be further circumvented through combined treatment with panPI3K and WNT inhibitors. Future clinical trials of these two inhibitors are warranted.

over-expression of Her-2/neu (HER2). Higher occurrences
of TNBC have been noted in younger and AfricanAmerican women. Few drug choices with the exception of
chemotherapy such as anthracycline, taxane and platinum
are currently available for the treatment of TNBC. Patients

with TNBC have a poor prognosis [1] because of the
tendency for early relapse and visceral metastasis [2, 3].
TNBC is also insensitive to some of the effective therapies
for breast cancer, including HER2-directed therapies, such
as trastuzumab, and endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen
or aromatase inhibitors. Hence, treatment of TNBC
remains a great challenge. Gene expression analysis has
revealed six subtypes of TNBC [4], including two basallike subtypes (BL1 and BL2) and immunomodulatory,
mesenchymal (M), mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), and
luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtypes. Current and
future treatment options include modulation of the DNA
repair machinery, p53 family signaling, androgen receptor
and MAPK/MEK signaling and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling. PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors are one of these
therapeutic regimens [5], and some of these inhibitors,
such as GDC-0941, BKM120 and Everolimus, have been
used as the therapeutic choice in recent clinical trials of
TNBC (https://clinicaltrials.gov). It was recently reported
that a PI3K inhibitor sensitized tumors to PARP inhibition
by impairing BRCA1/2 expression [6].
Aberrant wingless-type MMTV integration site
family (WNT) signaling has been noted in some human
cancers, including colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer
and breast cancer [7-9, 10]. The WNT/beta-catenin
signaling pathway is important for the regulation of cell
proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Therefore,
this pathway is a significant regulator of embryonic
development and tumorigenesis [11]. WNT proteins bind
to Frizzled (FZD), which is a seven-pass transmembrane
receptor protein, and to low-density lipoprotein receptorrelated protein5/6 (LRP5/6) to activate the WNT/betacatenin signaling pathway [12]. Activation of WNT/betacatenin signaling is observed in TNBC and is associated
with a poor clinical prognosis [9, 13-15]. Both the WNT/
beta-catenin and PI3K pathways play critical roles in
cancer cell biology. Moreover, the genes in one pathway
interact directly with genes in the other pathway to
integrate signaling in particular cell types. Integration of
signaling from these two important pathways enhances
cancerous growth in tumors and confers resistance
against targeted therapy [16, 17]. This study reports the
interaction between the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and WNT/betacatenin signaling pathways in TNBC cells with pan-PI3K
inhibitor treatment. This interaction conferred resistance to
the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 in the MDA-MB-231
and HCC1937 TNBC cell lines. Taken together, our
findings elucidate a possible mechanism explaining the
ineffectiveness of pan-PI3K inhibitors in TNBC treatment.

In vitro crosstalk between WNT and mTOR in
MDA-MB-231 cells
Our previous paper identified FZD7 as the WNT/
beta-catenin receptor and WNT5B as the WNT/betacatenin ligand in MDA-MB-231 cells [11, 14]. We
blocked FZD7 or WNT5B to evaluate changes in activity
in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and to investigate the
crosstalk between the WNT/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells. Lentiviruses
targeting FZD7 and WNT5B (shFZD7 and shWNT5B,
respectively) were used to suppress FZD7 and WNT5B.
Western blot results indicated that WNT/beta-catenin
signaling was attenuated, as demonstrated by enhanced
GSK3β phosphorylation. However, downstream signaling
of the PI3K pathway was also suppressed following
the inhibition of WNT/beta-catenin signaling through
shWNT5B or shFZD7 expression, as demonstrated by
decreased phosphorylation of TSC2 and 4EBP1 (Figure
1A, left). GSK3β plays a role in bridging WNT/betacatenin signaling with the mTOR pathway through
interactions with TSC2 in certain type of cells [16].
Therefore, we examined the existence of this crosstalk
function in the MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line. We
knocked down GSK3α/β using siRNA to address this
question. GSK3β knock-down decreased beta-catenin
phosphorylation and suppressed the phosphorylation
of the PI3K pathway gene TSC2 and its response gene,
4EBP1 (Figure 1A, right). These results demonstrated
that WNT signaling interfered with PI3K signaling in
MDA-MB-231 cells, which implied that aberrant WNT
signaling may compromise the effect of upstream PI3K
inhibitors. Wortmannin is a potent PI3K inhibitor used
in laboratory settings. We examined whether WNT could
rescue the Wortmannin–induced suppression of AKT and
mTOR. Figure 1B reveals that Wortmannin treatment
decreased the mTOR signal, but the supply of WNT3A
rescued 4EBP1 phosphorylation. The level of p-AKT did
not change following WNT3A treatment, possibly because
AKT is located upstream of TSC2. These results showed
that excessive WNT may confer resistance to PI3K
inhibitors, which may function through the cooperation
between GSK3β and TSC2 in MDA-MB-231 cells.

PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in MDA-MB-231,
HCC1937, MCF-7 and SK-BR3 cells
PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors are used clinically
for the treatment of breast cancer. We compared the
efficiency of pan-PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors in
three breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and
SK-BR3, which represent triple negative, ER-positive

and HER2/Neu-positive breast cancers, respectively.
GDC-0941 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor; Perifosine is an
AKT inhibitor; Everolimus is an mTOR1 inhibitor; and
BEZ235 is a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor. Proliferation
assays revealed that SK-BR3 cells were sensitive to all
of the PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors tested in this
study, but MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were resistant
to the AKT inhibitor Perifosine (Figure 2A). Only MDAMB-231 cells were resistant to the pan-PI3K inhibitor
(pan-PI3KI) GDC-0941. We tested GDC-0941, BKM120
and XL-147 in these three cell lines to investigate whether
MDA-MB-231 cells were resistant to all of the available
pan-PI3K inhibitors. All of these inhibitors failed to
inhibit the MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line. However, they
all successfully suppressed the proliferation of MCF7
and SK-BR3 cells (Figure 2B). We added another triple
negative breast cancer cell line, HCC1937 and treated
these four cell line cells with different concentrations of
pan-PI3K inhibitors to exclude the possibility that the
resistance of MDA-MB-231 cells was not caused by an
improper dose; and verify whether the resistance only
occurs in MDA-MB-231 cells Figure 2C shows that all
three pan-PI3K inhibitors suppressed the proliferation of
MCF-7 and SK-BR3 cells in a dose-dependent manner,
but there was no dose-dependent effect in MDA-MB-231
and HCC1937 cells. The IC50s for these inhibitors in
MCF-7, SK-BR3,MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells are
listed in Figure 2D. These findings confirmed that the

MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 TNBC cell line cells are
resistant to pan-PI3K inhibitors.

An aberrant WNT signal induced resistance to
pan-PI3K inhibitors in TBNC cell line cells
We demonstrated the activation of WNT/betacatenin signaling and the interaction of this pathway with
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells.
Therefore, we sought to identify whether the resistance of
MDA-MB-231 cells to PI3K inhibitors resulted from the
crosstalk of the WNT and mTOR pathways. We performed
immunoblotting to examine 4-EBP1 phosphorylation in
MDA-MB-231, HCC1937, MCF-7 and SK-BR3 cells
during the time course of GDC-0941 treatment. Notably,
the suppression of p-4EBP1 reached a maximum level in
3 hr and started to rebound in 6 hr in MDA-MB-231 and
HCC1937 cells, whereas p-4EBP1 remained inhibited
at the last time point (6 hr) in MCF7 and SK-BR3 cells
(Figure 3A). The TOPflash reporter system is widely used
to monitor the activity of the TCF promoter, which is the
downstream transcription factor in the WNT/beta-catenin
pathway. We employed a TOPflash luciferase assay to
examine WNT/beta-catenin signaling activity in MDAMB-231, HCC1937, MCF7 and SK-BR3 cells. We found
that MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells exhibited higher
WNT/beta-catenin activity than MCF-7 and SK-BR3

blotting 48 hr after transfection (right). (B) MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with or without WNT3A (75 ng/ml) for 24 hr. The PI3K

key step in WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation.
Immunofluorescence (IF) staining revealed that higher
level of beta-catenin was expressed in MDA-MB-231 and
HCC1937 cells compared with SK-BR3 and MCF7 cells.
Surprisingly, GDC-0941 treatment significantly enhanced
the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin in MDA-MB-231
and HCC1937 cells compared with vehicle-treated cells
(Figure 4A). We speculated that GDC-0941 activated
the WNT/beta-catenin pathway in MDA-MB-231 and
HCC1937 cells. Therefore, we applied a TOPflash
luciferase assay to verify our initial observations of betacatenin. TCF promoter activity increased in GDC-0941treated MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells, and this
increase was significant (p=0.017, p=0.013 respectively).
A similar increase was detected in MCF7 cells, but it was
not statistically significant. However, GDC-0941 treatment
greatly decreased WNT/beta-catenin signaling in GDC0941-sensitive SK-BR3 cells (Figure 4B). WNT/betacatenin pathway is triggered by the WNT ligand, which
binds the FZD receptor to stimulate the phosphorylation
of its co-receptor, LRP5/6. Western blotting showed that
GDC-0941 stimulated LRP6 phosphorylation in MDA-

cells (Figure 3B). Robust WNT/beta-catenin activity was
observed in MDA-MB-231 cells, and we speculated that
the rebound of 4-EBP1 phosphorylation during extended
GDC-0941 treatment might be due to an aberrant WNT/
beta-catenin signal. We pre-treated cells with or without
WNT3A for 24 hr and added GDC-0941 in the last
hour to investigate this hypothesis. Treated cells were
collected for Western blotting. We noted enhanced 4EBP1
phosphorylation with adding excessive WNT3A, which
is a ligand of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway. These data
confirmed that WNT3A rescued the attenuated mTOR
activity induced by GDC-0941 treatment in MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 3C). These data suggest that the
resistance to PI3KIs observed in TNBCcells was caused
by WNT/beta-catenin activation.

GDC-0941 activates the canonical WNT signal in
TNBC cells
We further assessed the expression of WNT
signaling in GDC-0941-treated breast cancer cells.
The nuclear translocation of beta-catenin is the

MB-231 and HCC1937 cells, but not in MCF7 cells
(Figure 4C), which implies that GDC-0941 initiated the
WNT/beta-catenin signaling upstream in this pathway.
Therefore, we evaluated WNT expression levels in
GDC-0941- or vehicle-treated MDA-MB-231 cells.
Classically, WNT1/2/3/3A/8A/8B/10A/10B are classified
as canonical ligands, whereas WNT4/5A/6/7A/7B/11
are known as non-canonical ligands. The other WNTs,
WNT2B/9A/9B/16, remain unclassified [18, 19]. We

recently showed that WNT5B also stimulates the WNT/
beta-catenin pathway and acts as a canonical WNT
ligand in MDA-MB-231 cells [11]. RT-qPCR analysis of
WNT expression in MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrated
that WNT2B, WNT3, WNT5B and WNT10A were
significantly up-regulated in GDC-0941 treated cells,
and WNT10B was significantly down-regulated (Figure
4D). The strong elevation of three of four canonical
ligands could explain the activation of WNT/beta-catenin

signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells following GDC-0941
treatment. These findings demonstrated that GDC-0941
stimulated the transcription of WNTs, which promoted
WNT-beta-catenin signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells.

0941, and GDC-0941 amplified the WNT/beta-catenin
signal in MDA-MB-231 cells. We next evaluated whether
GDC-0941 functioned in a similar manner in vivo. We
treated MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and SK-BR3 cells with
GDC-0941 for 24 hr and transplanted the cells into nude
athymic mice. Xenograft tumors successfully formed in
MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 cells, but not in MCF7 cells.
The failure of tumor formation in MCF7 cells may occur
because these cells are incapable of developing tumors
in vivo. Tumor volumes were measured every 4 days
for 32 days. The average tumor volume generated from

GDC-0941 exerted distinct effects in different
tumor-derived cell line cells in vivo
We found that aberrant WNT/beta-catenin signaling
conferred resistance to the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-

used as a negative control. Tumor volume was measured every 4 days for 32 days. The results represent means ± SEM (n = 6). In an
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft model, the GDC-0941-treated tumor volume was greater than that of vehicle-treated tumors, but
statistical significance was not reached (P =0.2127) (left panel). In SK-BR3 xenograft tumors, GDC-0941 showed significant antitumor
activity compared with vehicle-treated tumors (P = 0.0032). (B) The tumors were collected, and frozen tumor sections were used for
immunohistochemistry staining of p-LRP6, p-4EBP1 and beta-catenin.

GDC-0941-treated MDA-MB-231 cells was greater than
for vehicle-treated cells, although statistical significance
was not achieved (P=0.217) (Figure 5A, left panel).
However, GDC-0941 displayed strong antitumor activity
in SK-BR3 xenograft tumors (P=0.032) (Figure 5A, right
panel). These data confirmed that HER2-overexpressing
tumors are sensitive to pan-PI3K inhibitors, whereas
TNBC cell-derived tumors are resistant. We investigated
the expression of p-LRP6, beta-catenin and p-4EBP1 in
xenograft tumors to address the mechanism of resistance
in vivo. Immunohistochemistry revealed enhanced LRP6 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of betacatenin in GDC-0941-treated MDA-MB-231 tumors, but
not in SK-BR3 tumors. The phosphorylation of 4-EBP1
was decreased in SK-BR3 tumors, but it was not altered

in MDA-MB-231 tumors (Figure 5B). These data are
consistent with our in vitro data, which suggest that GDC0941 triggers a canonical WNT signal in vivo in MDAMB-231-derived tumors.

The combination of GDC-0941 and LGK974
showed a synergistic effect in MDA-MB-231 cells
PI3k inhibitors are one potential treatment for
TNBC. However, we found that the pan-PI3K inhibitor
GDC-0941 enhanced Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the
MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line, which may be the reason
for the drug resistance of these cells. Therefore, we
combined GDC-0941 with a WNT antagonist, LGK974,

Figure 6: A WNT inhibitor enhanced the efficacy of GDC-0941 in MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) MDA-MB-231 and MCF7
cells were treated with GDC-0941 combined with LGK974. The doses we used for GDC-0941 were 0.8 µM, 1.6 µM and 3.2 µM, and the
doses for LGK974 were 0.75 µM, 1.5 µM and 3 µM, respectively. After incubation for 72 hr, proliferation assays were performed, and the
synergistic effect was analyzed using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft). The combination index (CI) theorem defined the resulting calculation
as an addictive effect, CI=1; synergism, CI<1 or antagonism, CI>1. (B) Schematic model for the potential pathways involved in the effects

which is currently being used in clinical trials for the
treatment of breast cancer. LGK974 is an inhibitor of
PORCN, which is required for the palmitoylation and
subsequent secretion of WNT [20]. We tested LGK974 in
MDA-MB-231 cells to examine its inhibition of the WNT/
beta-catenin pathway. Only mild inhibition was detected
at lower concentrations, but we chose LGK974 to perform
the combination assay because of the limited availability
of WNT inhibitors. The cell proliferation results
showed that a synergistic effect was achieved at lower
concentrations, which may be due to the weak efficacy
of LGK974 in MDA-MB-231 cells. However, we did not
observe any synergistic effect in MCF7 cells (Figure 6A).
This finding raised the possibility that the addition of a
WNT pathway inhibitor may reduce resistance to panPI3K inhibitors in TNBC therapeutics.

a rational combination of inhibitors for suppressing certain
sets of genes might be necessary for targeting therapies
applied to treat TNBC.
The WNT signaling cascade is crucial for normal
embryonic development and adult homeostasis in a variety
of organ systems. Deregulation of WNT/beta-catenin
signaling is related to many types of human cancer [31]
and other diseases, such as metabolic disease, fibrosis
and neurodegenerative disorders [32-34]. The activation
of WNT/beta-catenin signaling is tightly modulated and
may elicit unpredictable outcomes, depending on the
context [35]. WNT pathway activation in human cancers
is associated with gene mutations such as APC mutations
[36, 37], AXIN mutations and beta-catenin mutations [38],
epigenetic modifications such as methylation of the WNT
negative regulator and secreted Frizzled-related proteins
(SFRPs) [39] and positive or negative feedback control
of gene expression in WNT/beta-catenin pathways. This
study provides evidence that the pan-PI3K inhibitor
GDC-0941 triggered the WNT/beta-catenin cascade in the
MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 TNBC cell line cells. This
mechanism might be due to feedback regulation or GDC0941-induced alterations in genome stability. However,
elucidation of the detailed mechanism will require further
studies.

Discussion
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade plays
a central role in cell biology, including proliferation,
survival, metabolism, angiogenesis and genome stability,
and this cascade is deregulated in diverse human cancers
[21, 22]. Therefore, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway kinase
inhibitors are widely investigated in laboratory and
clinical trials. However, the therapeutic efficacy of a
single agent is compromised clinically [23, 24]. The
current study showed that TNBC cells were resistant to
the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 both in vivo and in
vitro. The acquired resistance was induced by the crosstalk
of GSK3β, a WNT/beta-catenin kinase, with TSC2, a
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway gene, which modulated
mTOR activity, as well as the stimulation of canonical
WNT transcription, which further strengthened WNT/
beta-catenin signaling. The overexpression of WNT/
beta-catenin signaling overcame the inhibition of mTOR
induced by the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (Figure 6B).
Therefore GDC-0941 may actually potentiate cancer cell
growth to cause drug resistance. Our findings provide good
insight into the selection and combination of inhibitors
for TNBC treatment. The outcomes of breast cancer have
improved steadily, but TNBC remains the subtype with
the worst prognosis [25, 26]. TNBC represents a highly
heterogeneous class of breast cancer in terms of both
the gene expression profile and the repertoire of genetic
events. Therefore, the targeting of a subset, rather than a
particular gene, will be critical for TNBC management
[27]. We demonstrated that two cancer pathways are
involved in TNBC, and both pathways need to be targeted
simultaneously. However, there are numerous undetected
signaling pathways that might be active and require
suppression. This hypothesis can be exemplified by the
potentiating of the antiproliferative activity of the PI3K
inhibitor observed when other inhibitors, such as androgen
receptor inhibitor, EGFR inhibitor and PARP inhibitors,
are used together with PI3K inhibitors [28-30]. Therefore,

(DMEM), HCC1937 cells were cultured in RPMI140
and SK-BR3 cells were cultured in MaCoy’s 5A with
10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The cells were
incubated at 37˚C under 5% CO2. The compounds
used in this study were purchased from the following
vendors: Wortmannin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO),
GDC-0941 (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA), Perifosine
(LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA), Everolimus (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO), NVP-BEZ235 (LC Laboratories,
Woburn, MA), BKM120 (Chemie Tek, Indianapolis,
IN), XL147 (Chemie Tek, Indianapolis, IN), LGK974
(StemRd, Burlingame, CA), and WNT3A (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN).

Cell growth and proliferation assays
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates in 100 μl of
complete medium at a concentration of 2,000 cells per
11069

Oncotarget

60%–70% confluence. The cells were subsequently
treated with 0.5 µM GDC-0941 for 18 hr, followed by two
washes with PBS buffer. Then, the cells were fixed using
4% paraformaldehyde for 25 min at room temperature,
permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and
incubated with a purified mouse anti-β-catenin antibody
(BD Biosciences; 1: 500) at room temperature for 2 hr.
The secondary antibody was an Alexa Fluor 680 goat
anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies). DAPI was used to
visualize DNA. Fluorescence microscopy was performed
in the City of Hope Microscope Core.

well the day before treatment. The cells were then treated
with drugs for 72 hr for cytotoxicity assays. Viable cells
were detected using 10 μg/ml fluorescein diacetate with 50
μl 0.5% eosin-Y/well to quench fluorescence in nonviable
cells, followed by incubation at room temperature (RT)
in the dark for 20 min. Fluorescence in viable cells was
detected using DIMSCAN according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

siRNA transfection
Cells were suspended in 3 ml of medium and
seeded into one well of a 6-well plate at a cell density
of 2.5× 105/ml the day before transfection. All small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Dallas TX). The stock
concentration of each siRNA was 10 µM. Equal volumes
of siRNA and the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) were diluted in OptiMEM I medium without serum prior to mixing, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, to form RNAi duplex–
lipofectamine RNAiMAX complexes. These complexes
were then incubated at RT for 10 min. The culture medium
was removed during the incubation period and replaced
with 2 ml of antibiotic-free complete medium. The above
mixture was added drop-wise to each well after incubation,
at a final siRNA concentration of 30 nM.

Luciferase assay
MDA-MB-231, HCC1937, MCF-7 and SK-BR3
cells were distributed into 24-well plates the day before
transfection. Cells at 80% confluence were co-transfected
with a TCF-driven TOPflash reporter plasmid (Millipore)
(400 ng) and control Renilla luciferase (25 ng) using 1.5 μl
of Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). After 48 hr of
co-culture, cells were lysed in 1X passive lysis buffer, and
the supernatant was collected for dual luciferase activity
measurements (Promega, Madison, WI). Firefly luciferase
activity was normalized for each sample using Renilla
luciferase activity as an internal control.

Real-time RT-PCR

Western blot analysis

For complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis, total
RNA (1 mg) was transcribed using random hexamers (Life
Technologies) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase
(Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
For DNA amplification, cDNA was denatured at 94°C
for 30 s, and primers were annealed at 55–62°C for 30 s.
DNA extension was performed at 72°C for 30 s for 24–30
cycles. Real-time RT–PCR analyses of WNT2B, WNT3,
WNT5A, WNT5B, WNT6, WNT7A, WNT9A, WNT10A
and WNT10B were performed using an iQ5 iCycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The amplification conditions consisted of
an initial incubation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40
cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 59°C for 30 s. The data were
analyzed using Bio-Rad iQ5 Optical System Software
v2.0. All products yielded a single band of the predicted
size.

Cell proteins were extracted from cells using
RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) containing
a phosphatase inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Equal
amounts of protein were loaded and separated through
SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to a
membrane, and the blot was blocked with 10% non-fat
milk in TBST. The membranes were probed overnight
at 4°C using the following antibodies: PI3 Kinase
p110α, p-4E-BP1 (T70), 4E-BP1 (53H11), phosphorAKT (Ser473), Akt (pan), p-GSK-3-alpha/beta (S21/9)
(D17D2), GSK-3alpha/beta (D75D3), p-Tuberin/TSC2
(Ser939), p-beta-catenin (Ser33/34/Thr41), LRP6 (C5C7),
p-LRP6 (S1490) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), Myc
(9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), FZD7
and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Appropriate
antibodies were used for secondary antibody reactions.
The ECL Plus Western Blot Detecting System (GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) was employed to detect the
presence of antibodies.

and Irradiated Lab Diet®, which consisted of 20.0%
crude protein, 9.9% crude fat, and 4.7% crude fiber. The
mice were housed at the National Taiwan University
Laboratory Animal Center (NTUMC) under a 12-hr light
cycle at 21–23 °C and 60–85% humidity. Nude athymic
mice were maintained in accordance with the procedures
and guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Human MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 breast
cancer cells were maintained in DMEM or MaCoy’s 5A
medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100
μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B,
and 25 μg/ml gentamicin. The medium was supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine. Cells
were cultured in tissue culture flasks in a humidified
incubator at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95%
air. There were two groups of 6 animals. One group was
used as controls (DMSO treatment), and the other group
received GDC-0941 treatment. Cells were treated in vitro
with 0.5 µM/ml GDC-0941 for 24 hr before injection. For
each animal, 5 million cells in 100 µl were injected under
the mammary pad. Tumor size (in mm3) was calculated
using the formula Tumor volume = (w2 x l) / 2, where w
= width and l = length in mm of the tumor. The tumor
volume 24 hr after tumor implantation was taken as the
baseline in each animal, and tumor size was measured
every 4 days for 32 days.
