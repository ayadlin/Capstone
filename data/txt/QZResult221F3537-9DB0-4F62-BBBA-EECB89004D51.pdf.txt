BACKGROUND. Rapid clearance of poly(ethylene glycol)-asparaginase (PEGASNase) has been reported for up to one-third of patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), potentially rendering their treatment ineffective. A
25% occurrence of an antibody against PEG (anti-PEG) was previously reported
in healthy blood donors. The objective of the study was to determine whether
anti-PEG was associated with rapid clearance PEG-ASNase.

METHODS. The investigation reanalyzed stored sera from pediatric patients enrolled in the ALL Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster 2000 studies. Twenty-eight samples

CONCLUSIONS. The presence of anti-PEG was very closely associated with rapid
clearance of PEG-ASNase. Further comprehensive studies are warranted to fully
elucidate the effect of anti-PEG on PEG-conjugated agents. Screening and monitoring for anti-PEG may allow identification of patients for whom a modified
dosing strategy or use of a non-PEGylated drug would be appropriate. Cancer

mmunogenicity, antigenicity, toxicity, and rapid renal clearance of
exogenous therapeutic agents are critical concerns for the pharmaceutical industry. Altering the properties of agents to suppress
drug clearance and reduce toxicity while maintaining potency and
efficacy are therefore goals for the introduction of new therapies.
One very successful and widely used method to reduce clearance
and toxicity is the covalent attachment of poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) to the therapeutic agent.1–21 This approach ‘masks’ the agent
from the host’s immune system, reduces toxicity, and slows renal
clearance by increasing the hydrodynamic size of the agent.
Modification of exogenous proteins by the covalent attachment
of PEG was first reported in 1977 by Abuchowski et al.1,2 They
demonstrated a significant increase in the circulatory time and that

immunogenicity and antigenicity was almost abolished for PEGylated proteins versus the unmodified
protein. The covalent attachment of PEG to a wide
range of therapeutic agents is now commonly used,
including PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase, [Pegaspargase, Oncaspar]) for leukemia and lymphoma,3 PEGinterferon alpha 2a (Pegasus) and 2b (PEG-Intron)
for chronic hepatitis C virus,4,5 PEG-filgrastim (Neulasta) for neutropenia,6,7 and PEG-adenosine deaminase for severe combined immunodeficiency
syndrome.8 In addition, numerous other agents for
PEGylation are in use or are being developed.9–21
Whereas PEG has long been claimed to be nonantigenic and weakly immunogenic,9–13 the existence
of a naturally occurring antibody against PEG (antiPEG) has been known since 1983,22 and the antibody
has been successfully induced in animal models.23–27
Richter and Akerblom22 determined that the occurrence of anti-PEG in the healthy population was
0.2%, and from their studies with allergic patients
determined the anti-PEG to be predominantly immunoglobulin M (IgM). They concluded that the antibody was of no clinical significance for PEGmodified allergens in hyposensitization therapy.22
More recently, we detected a markedly higher occurrence (22%–25%) of anti-PEG in the healthy blood
donor population (350 donors) and identified both
IgG and IgM.28–30 Anti-PEG was induced in 5 of 13
patients treated for chronic refractory gout with
PEG-uricase, identified as a low titer IgG and IgM.
Rapid clearance of PEG-uricase was observed in this
subset of patients, limiting the potential use of this
agent for treatment of hyperuricemia.31
Rapid clearance of PEG-ASNase has been observed
for a subgroup of pediatric patients treated for acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)32,33 without any clinical
evidence of an allergic reaction. The rapid clearance of
PEG-ASNase may well render the treatment ineffective,
as it is commonly agreed that a trough serum ASNase
activity of 100 U/L for 14 days and 50 U/L for 21
days is required to deplete asparagine (ASN) to achieve
a complete response in ALL.34,35
The present study was primarily designed to
determine whether the presence of anti-PEG was
associated with rapid clearance of PEG-ASNase
observed for a subgroup of pediatric patients treated
for ALL,32,33 with a secondary goal of establishing a
simple and reliable technique for the detection of
anti-PEG in blood sera.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Serum sampling was performed during the Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster

(ALL-BFM) 2000 studies, which are multicenter therapy optimization studies for the treatment of ALL in
children.36,37 The protocol was approved by local
ethics committees and was carried out according to
the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was
obtained from patients and/or their parents for
blood sampling, drug monitoring, and research when
entering the study.

Patients
This study reanalyzed stored serum samples collected from 44 pediatric leukemia patients who were
enrolled in the ALL-BFM 2000 and the ALL-BFM
REZ 2002 study. Twenty-eight received PEG-ASNase
(Oncaspar, Wedel, Germany; 1000 U/m2, 17 male, 11
female, mean age 5 8.3 years), and 16 received
unmodified Escherichia coli ASNase (Medac; 5000 or
10,000 U/m2, 10 male, 6 female, mean age 8.8
years). There was no significant difference in age
between the 2 treatment groups (P 5 .761). Patients
in the PEG-ASNase group had received up to 8
doses of E. coli ASNase or up to 5 doses of Erwinia
chrysanthemi ASNase. Recurrence patients from the
ALL-BFM REZ 2002 study had received up to 6 previous doses of PEG-ASNase. Twelve patients in the
PEG-ASNase group had no recorded prior exposure
to any ASNase, 7 of which had undetectable ASNase
activity. Nine patients in the PEG-ASNase group
were enrolled in the ALL-BFM REZ 2002 study, and
19 patients were enrolled in the ALL-BFM 2000
study. After enrollment in the studies, serum samples were typically collected after the first dose of
PEG-ASNase.
Patients in the unmodified ASNase group had
received up to 8 doses of ASNase before sampling.
No patients in this group had any documented prior
exposure to PEG-ASNase or Erwinia ASNase. All
patients in the ASNase group were enrolled in the
ALL-BFM 2000 study. Typically, serum samples were
collected after the seventh dose and before administration of the eighth dose of ASNase.
Serum samples were collected at 0 to 15 days
after drug administration (mean 5 7.1 days for
PEG-ASNase and 3.0 days for ASNase) and were
assayed for ASNase activity using a microplate technique.38 Note that the 28 serum samples from PEGASNase-treated patients were selected to include 15
subjects with undetectable ASNase activity and 13
with effective ASNase activity (>100 U/L).34,35 Similarly, the serum samples from 16 subjects treated
with unmodified ASNase were selected to include 8
subjects with ASNase below therapeutic levels (<50
U/L) activity and 8 with effective ASNase activity
(>50 U/L).34,35

Testing for Anti-PEG
All testing for anti-PEG was performed in a blinded
manner with samples identifiable only by means of a
code number. Data for ASNase activity and treatment
group were integrated with serological and flow cytometric results only after all anti-PEG testing was
completed.
Preparation of Reagent PEG-RBCs
Blood group O RBCs (red blood cells) were washed
with 10 mM Dulbecco phosphate buffered saline
([PBS] pH 7.4, 290 mOsmol/kg), then resuspended at
10% hematocrit in 15 mM triethanolamine buffer
(pH 8.2, 290 mOsmol/kg). A fresh solution of methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-succinimidyl propionate
of molecular mass 20 kDa (Nektar Therapeutics,
Huntsville, Ala) dissolved in cold 10 mM HCl/saline
was added to the RBC suspension to yield a final
polymer concentration of 10 mg/mL. The sample
was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and
then washed 3 times with PBS.29 PEG-RBCs and control RBCs (without PEG) were resuspended to a final
hematocrit of 5% in PBS.
Anti-PEG by Serology
Two drops of test serum were added to 1 drop of
control or PEG-coated 5% hematocrit RBC suspensions in a 10 3 75 mm glass test tube, mixed gently,
and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes.
The suspension was centrifuged at 500 g for 1 minute and agglutination scored according to the 0–41
scale.39 Samples that were positive for anti-PEG
caused agglutination of the PEG-coated RBCs but
not the control RBCs.
Anti-PEG by Flow Cytometry
A 1% (w/v) stock suspension of 10-lm diameter
TentaGel-OH particles (RAPP Polymere, Tubingen,
Germany) was prepared in PBS and briefly sonicated
to disrupt any particulate aggregates. Twenty-five
microliters of the TentaGel-OH stock was added to
50 lL of serum and 100 lL of PBS, the sample was
incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, and
then washed 3 times with PBS (200 g for 2 minutes).
The centrifuged pellet was resuspended in 0.5 mL of
PBS containing 5 lL of fluorescein-labeled antihuman IgG (whole molecule goat FITC-anti-IgG, Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo) and 2.5 lL of R-phycoerythrin-labeled antihuman IgM (l-chain specific
goat RPE-anti-IgM, Sigma), mixed gently, and then
incubated in the dark for 1 hour at room temperature. The particles were washed (3 times, PBS, 200 g
for 2 minutes), resuspended in PBS, and the mean
fluorescence intensity of 10,000 single TentaGel-OH

105

particles was determined by flow cytometry (EPICSXL MCS, Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose,
Calif; FL-1 and FL-2 channels for FITC and RPE,
respectively). Samples with a mean fluorescence intensity of >100 for IgG and/or >50 for IgM were
identified as positive for anti-PEG.

Testing for Anti-ASNase
L-ASNase (Sigma) was dissolved in Immunopure
Binding Buffer (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill),
pipetted into a 96-well black plate at a protein concentration of 50 lg/well (10 U/well) and incubated
for 4 hours at room temperature. The wells were
washed (53) with PBS, blocked overnight at 48C with
4% milk/2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), then
washed again (53) with PBS. Five lL of serum 1 150
lL of binding buffer were added to each well, incubated for 2 hours at room temperature, and PBSwashed 5 times. One hundred microliters of PBS
containing 5 lL of FITC-antihuman IgG and 2.5 lL
of RPE-antihuman IgM were added, incubated for 1
hour at room temperature, and then washed (53)
with PBS. Two hundred microliters of PBS were
added and fluorescence recorded using a microplate
reader (GENios Pro, Tecan Systems, San Jose, Calif)
with absorbance/emission filters of 485/535 nm and
485/595 nm for IgG and IgM, respectively. AntiASNase positives showed higher fluorescence than
uncoated control wells after correction for background fluorescence.
Statistical Analysis
Unless otherwise stated, differences between groups
were tested using the Student t-test. The sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative
predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of flow cytometric and serological determination of anti-PEG
were derived using the ASNase activity level as the
gold standard. The 95% confidence intervals (CI)
were derived using the binomial and F probability
distributions.

RESULTS
The mean serum ASNase activities for all samples
tested were 240 U/L for the PEG-ASNase group and
84 U/L ASNase group.
By serological testing with PEG-RBCs, 9 of the 28
sera (32%) from patients treated with PEG-ASNase
contained anti-PEG (Fig. 1). Strong agglutination (41)
was noted for 6 patients, whereas 3 showed weaker
but still clearly positive agglutination (21w – 21).
The ASNase activity in all 9 of the anti-PEG-positive
sera was below the limit of detection (<5 U/L).

By using the flow cytometry-based assay, sera
from 13 (46%) of the PEG-ASNase treated patients
showed a positive signal for IgM anti-PEG (Fig. 2), 12
of which showed undetectable ASNase activity (<5
U/L), 1 sample had an ASNase activity of 123 U/L, at
the low end of the therapeutic range. All 9 patients
who were positive for anti-PEG by serology were
positive for IgG and IgM anti-PEG by flow cytometry
(IgG data not shown); the remaining 4 patients with
a positive result by flow cytometry only showed relatively weak fluorescence (<100) for IgM and were
negative for IgG. Both serological and flow cytometric analyses showed that all anti-PEG-positive
patient sera treated with PEG-ASNase showed low or
negligible ASNase activity: 1) <5 U/L versus a mean
of 353 U/L for anti-PEG-positive versus negative via
serology, P 5 7.7 3 10 5; 2) means of 12 and 438 U/
L for anti-PEG-positive versus negative via flow cytometry, P 5 3.6 3 10 5.
Of the 12 patients in the PEG-ASNase group that
had no documented prior exposure to PEG-ASNase,
7 (58%) had undetectable ASNase activity, 4 (33%) of
which were positive for anti-PEG. Of the 16 patients
in the PEG-ASNase group with documented prior
exposure to PEG-ASNase, 8 (50%) had undetectable
ASNase activity, all of which were positive for antiPEG. Nine (32%) of 28 patients in the PEG-ASNase
group had documented prior exposure to unmodified
ASNase, 6 (21%) had undetectable ASNase activity
and were also positive for anti-PEG.
Four sera from PEG-ASNase patients yielded
somewhat unusual results: 1 weak IgM anti-PEG-

positive sample showed measurable ASNase activity
and 3 anti-PEG negative patients had undetectable
ASNase activity, 2 of which were positive for antiASNase. Table 1 presents the measures of accuracy
and predictability of the flow cytometry and serological methods of anti-PEG determination for ASNase
activity in patients treated with PEG-ASNase. The
positive/negative predictive values of anti-PEG for
ASNase activity were 92%/80% and 100%/68% for
flow cytometric and serological detection of antiPEG. The overall accuracy was 86% (95% CI: 37%,
96%) for flow cytometry determinations and 79%
(95% CI: 59%, 92%) for serological determinations.
For the patients treated with unmodified ASNase
(Medac), 2 of 16 sera (13%) contained anti-PEG by
serology (Fig. 3): 1 with ASNase 9activity sufficient
for asparagine depletion (135 U/L) and 1 with low
ASNase activity (49 U/L). Six of 16 sera (38%) were
identified as anti-PEG-positive by flow cytometry
(Fig. 4), 3 with ASNase activity >100 U/L and 3 with
ASNase activity <50 U/L. No association was
observed between serum ASNase activity and antiPEG (means of 82 and 85 U/L for anti-PEG-positive
versus negative by flow cytometry, respectively,
P 5 .947). For ASNase-treated patients, the positive/
negative predictive values of anti-PEG for ASNase activity were 50%/50% for both flow cytometric and
serological detection of anti-PEG. The overall accuracy was 50% (95% CI: 25%, 75%) for both flow
cytometry and serological determinations, and all

DISCUSSION
The use of ASNases as a frontline treatment in ALL is
based on the findings that leukemic blast cells are
dependent on the extracellular availability of
ASN.34,35,40–42 Depletion of ASN leads to impaired
protein, DNA and RNA synthesis, and consequent
cell death in malignant cells. To attain complete
response to treatment of ALL with ASNase, a trough
serum ASNase activity of 100 U/L for 14 days and
50 U/L for 21 days is recommended for serum and
cerebrospinal fluid asparagine depletion.34,35,42,43
Different ASNases (E. coli, Erwinia, and PEG-ASNase)
have markedly different activities and clearances
(half-lives from 16 hours for Erwinia to 7 days for
PEG-ASNase)34,35,40–42 and it is clear that monitoring
of ASNase activity is an important factor for the
effective treatment of ALL irrespective of allergic
reactions, hypersensitivity, or silent inactivation.
The activity-time course after administration of
PEG-ASNase is characterized by a low distribution
volume and low clearance, resulting in clinically relevant activities for more than 3 weeks in most
patients.43 Despite the finding that the samples used
for this pilot study were preselected to include a disproportionately higher number of nonresponders in
both groups than would be anticipated in the general
ALL patient population, serum ASNase activity of the
PEG-ASNase group was almost 3-fold higher than the
ASNase group. This higher level of ASNase activity in
the PEG-ASNase group occurred despite a markedly
lower administered dose (i.e., mean activity of 240
U/L at 1000 U/m2 for a single dose of PEG-ASNase
versus mean activity of 84 U/L after at least 7 doses
of 5000–10,000 U/m2 of unmodified ASNase). In
addition, the mean sampling time after administration was longer for the PEG-ASNase group at 7.1
days versus 3.0 days for the ASNase group. Thus, in
the majority of patients PEG-ASNase achieves higher
and sustained ASNase activity than with conventional asparaginase. However, our data clearly show
that anti-PEG is closely associated with the rapid
clearance of PEG-ASNase for a subgroup of pediatric
patients treated for ALL32,33 without any clinical
manifestation of an allergy or hypersensitivity. In
addition, our findings provide further evidence
regarding the importance of ASNase activity measurement to ensure ASN depletion for the recommended period.34,35,42

As anticipated, no correlation was observed
between serum ASNase activity and the presence of
anti-PEG for the patients receiving unmodified
ASNase treatment. This lack of association is confirmed by the analysis presented in Table 1 that
shows a poor overall accuracy (50%) for anti-PEG as
a predictor of ASNase activity in ASNase-treated
patients. Conversely, analysis of the patient data for
those treated with PEG-ASNase clearly shows a
strong correlation between the occurrence of antiPEG and ASNase activity (P 5 3.6 3 10 5, Fig. 3, and
92%/92% and 100%/100% specificity/positive predictive value for flow cytometric and serological detection of anti-PEG, Table 1).
It is important to note that all PEG-ASNase-treated patient sera that were anti-PEG-positive by serology and 12/13 by flow cytometry showed
undetectable ASNase activity, indicating that antiPEG is a clinically significant antibody. It could be
argued that the agglutination of PEG-RBCs by sera
may be due to the exposure of a neoantigen or
crypt-antigen on the RBC surface consequent to
PEG-modification, rather than by an anti-PEG. This
alternative possibility does not seem tenable in view
of the following: 1) anti-PEG binds to TentaGel-OH
particles, which are composed primarily of PEG; 2)
undetectable ASNase activity was found for all PEGASNase-treated patient sera that contained anti-PEG
by serology. It is also notable that approximately
one-third of the ASNase-group tested positive for
anti-PEG, a frequency that is comparable to the
occurrence we determined in healthy blood
donors.28–30 This observation suggests that the antiPEG occurrence in the PEG-ASNase group was preexisting and most likely not induced by the PEGASNase treatment.
We have presented 2 techniques to test for the
presence anti-PEG and have addressed potential artifacts associated with either technique in the previous
paragraph. The sensitivity of the serological detection
of anti-PEG via direct agglutination of PEG-coated
RBCs may well be improved by using an amplification technique (antiglobulin test) which would also
detect samples that only contain an IgG anti-PEG.
We thus recommend further optimization studies
before the routine use of the serological technique.
With the current data, all serologically anti-PEG positive sera showed undetectable ASNase activity in the
PEG-ASNase group, which demonstrates the potential value of this technique.
Low serum ASNase activity was observed for 3
PEG-ASNase samples that tested negative for antiPEG (Fig. 2). Consistent with the low activity, 2 of
these sera tested positive for anti-ASNase. The other

Anti-PEG Clearance of PEG-Asparaginase/Armstrong et al.

serum sample showed no evidence of either antiPEG or anti-ASNase but had undetectable ASNase
activity (<5 U/L). An anomalous result was also
observed for 1 other sample that was weakly positive
for anti-PEG IgM (mean fluorescence of 65) and was
positive for anti-ASNase, but had ASNase activity
(123 U/L) at the low end of the therapeutic range.
Unfortunately, the amount of each serum sample
available for analysis was limited and further studies
were not possible for these latter 2 samples.
Although several review articles have stated
that PEG is weakly immunogenic and nonantigenic,9–13,17–19 nearly all directly or indirectly base
these comments on articles by Richter and Akerblom.22,23 In their clinical study,22 Richter and Akerblom showed a 0.2% occurrence of anti-PEG in the
healthy population (n 5 453) and 3.3% in allergic
patients (n 5 92). The occurrence of anti-PEG in allergic patients that were treated with PEG-conjugated
allergens increased to 50% after the initial treatment
(n 5 58), but dropped to 28.5% after 2 years of treatment (n 5 28). The authors concluded that the presence of anti-PEG was not clinically important when
using PEG-modified allergens in hyposensitization
therapy.22
Induction of anti-PEG in animal models23,25 has
shown that anti-PEG rapidly clears PEG-conjugated
RBCs, particles, and proteins.24–27 Considering the
possible significance of these animal study results, it
is unclear why no further investigations regarding
the clinical importance of anti-PEG appear to exist in
the literature. In part, this may be because of the
previous lack of simple and reliable assays for antiPEG, or may result from assuming that a 0.2% occurrence of anti-PEG in the healthy population would
have minimal impact compared with the rapid clearance or toxicity of unconjugated agents. It may also
be partly because of difficulties associated with generating antibodies to PEG alone, with this difficulty
likely caused by the rapid clearance of low molecular
mass PEGs primarily via renal excretion.44 However,
conjugation of PEG to proteins and particles may
augment the generation of anti-PEG because PEGylated material is present in the circulation for longer
periods of time and because the route of excretion
may be altered when compared with the unconjugated PEG.
Recently, Ganson et al.31 reported the induction
of anti-PEG, detectable between 3 and 7 days after
injection, in 5 of 13 patients treated for chronic refractory gout with PEG-uricase. Rapid clearance of
PEG-uricase was observed in the anti-PEG-positive
patients, identified as a low titer IgG and IgM antiPEG. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

109

(ELISA) test was used to detect anti-PEG, with positives identified as those with Ig binding to immobilized PEG-uricase and the absence of Ig binding to
immobilized uricase. In our current study it is
unclear whether anti-PEG was preexisting or induced
after exposure to PEG-ASNase, as no baseline samples were available. The existence of anti-PEG in 6 of
16 (38%) ASNase patient sera who had no documented prior exposure to PEG-ASNase (Fig. 4) may indicate that anti-PEG was preexisting in the PEGASNase-treated patients, as we have previously determined a 25% occurrence of anti-PEG in the healthy
blood donor population28–30 Nonetheless, the observations by Ganson et al.31 support our findings that
anti-PEG is most likely responsible for rapid clearance of a PEG-conjugated drug and may well explain
similar observations with other PEGylated agents (eg,
PEG-interferon45).
It is interesting to briefly consider the background that led to the present study. Our initial finding of an anti-PEG stemmed, accidentally, from our
earlier work to develop ‘universal’ blood by PEGcoating RBCs as a way to mask blood group antigens.30 Preliminary studies undertaken in the Garratty laboratories showed that sera from 22 of 100
healthy blood donors directly agglutinated PEGRBCs28 and that the agglutination appeared to be
because of an anti-PEG, predominantly IgM. We subsequently eliminated alternative possibilities for
agglutination (eg, nonspecific binding, neoantigens
or crypt-antigens) and confirmed the presence of an
antibody against PEG.30 Our study of 250 healthy
blood donor sera showed a markedly higher occurrence of anti-PEG (ie, 25%)29,30 than was reported 2
decades ago.22 This increase is most likely due to
greater exposure to PEG and PEG-containing compounds in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and processed food products. Both IgG and IgM were
identified, with the IgG subclass predominantly IgG2, although IgG-1 and IgG-3 were also observed.29,30
Studies of agglutination inhibition of PEG-RBCs by
preincubating anti-PEG-positive plasmas with a
range of oxyethylene oligomers and PEG indicated
that the epitope for anti-PEG was 4–5 repeat ethoxy
units (-C-O-C-) irrespective of the end group moiety46; this finding is in close agreement with the
results of Richter and Akerblom.23 Thus, because we
had previously shown the in vivo significance of
anti-PEG (ie, rapid clearance of PEG-RBCs in immunized rabbits25), we naturally began to question
whether anti-PEG could adversely affect PEG-conjugated therapeutic agents.
Lastly, it is of interest to consider effective therapeutic approaches for patients with anti-PEG. One

110

possibility would be the infusion of a PEG-containing
compound to block or suppress anti-PEG before
administration of a PEG-conjugated drug. To avoid
immune complex formation, the selection of a short
oxyethylene oligomer comparable in size to the antiPEG epitope (ie, 4–5 repeat ethoxy units) conjugated
to a core group may be of value. In addition, larger
clinical studies are clearly warranted in order to
expand on the relatively small number of patient
sera tested in the present study, and thus to more
clearly define the role of anti-PEG in the clearance of
PEG-conjugated drugs.

Conclusions
Our finding that the presence of anti-PEG is very closely associated with rapid clearance of PEG-ASNase
may explain similar observations with other PEGconjugated drugs (eg, PEG-interferon45). We would
recommend further comprehensive studies to fully
elucidate the effect of preexisting and the development of anti-PEG on PEG-ASNase and other
PEG-conjugated agents. For the majority of patients,
PEG-conjugation is beneficial for the treatment and
management of various diseases where clearance or
toxicity of the unmodified drug is a significant barrier. Although the advantages of PEG-conjugation are
apparent, if our findings here are confirmed in a
comprehensive study, we recommend that patients
should be screened for preexisting anti-PEG and routinely monitored for the development of anti-PEG
throughout the course of treatment with any PEGcontaining agent. If an anti-PEG is found, then either
the clearance rate of the PEG-conjugated drug
should be carefully monitored and the doses
adjusted to compensate, or, if available, substitution
with an effective non-PEGylated alternative therapeutic agent should be considered.
