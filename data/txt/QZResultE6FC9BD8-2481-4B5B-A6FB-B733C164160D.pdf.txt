Abstract
Hypoxia, which is frequently observed in liver cancer and metastasis, influences
tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Although hypoxia-associated biomarkers
are of use in other cancers, none is recognized as a surrogate for hypoxia in liver
cancer. In this study, we generated seven unique human single-chain Fv (scFv)
antibodies (Abs) specific to hypoxic liver cancer cells, using normoxia-depleted
vs hypoxia-selected phage library panning technology. By developing the scFv
immunoprecipitation-based mass spectrometry method, the antigen that bound with
one of the Abs (H103) was identified as the M2 splice isoform of pyruvate kinase
(PKM2), an enzyme that is a key regulator of aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells.
Increased expression of PKM2 was induced by hypoxia in liver cancer cell lines.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed that PKM2 was highly expressed in
moderately and well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues with a
hypovascular staining pattern. High expression of PKM2 was also localized in the
perinecrotic area of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) tissues. The percentage
of the HCC or ICC tumor expressing PKM2 was significantly higher with more tumor
necrosis, low microvessel density, and advanced stage. Moreover, the H103 scFv Ab
was efficiently internalized into hypoxic liver cancer cells and could have potential for
targeted drug delivery. Conclusion: our study, for the first time, developed hypoxiaspecific scFv Ab H103 to liver cancer cells, and revealed that PKM2 is a promising
biomarker for hypoxia in HCC and ICC tissues. These allow further exploration of this
valuable Ab and PKM2 antigen for hypoxia targeting in liver cancer.

Introduction

Although the liver is a hypervascular organ,
severe hypoxia is always found inside hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) due to its rapid growth nature. HCC
is generally developed through cirrhosis, which always
causes fibrogenesis which demolishes the normal blood
system, leads to a shortage of blood circulation and finally
results in hypoxia. Moreover, conventional palliative
therapies for HCC including hepatic artery ligation
(HAL), trans-catheter arterial embolization (TAE), and
trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) can
also cause hypoxia. Although the principle of these
palliative therapies is to restrict blood supply to suppress
tumor growth, these therapies which induce hepatic
ischemia always catastrophically result in hypoxia. No

Hypoxia is not only considered to be a hallmark
of cancer which promotes angiogenesis, invasiveness,
and metastasis, but also has a major role in metabolic
reprogramming of cancer cells which allows cells to
survive in a hostile secondary metastatic environment [1].
Moreover, tumor self-renewal, metastatic potential, and
chemo- and radiotherapy resistance are thought to be
driven by a population of cancer stem cells (CSC), which
remain dormant in hypoxic microenvironmental niches [2].
Because of its central role in tumor progression and
resistance to therapy, cancer cell adaptation to hypoxia has
been used to develop tumor markers and target therapies [3].

biomarkers, such as the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF),
carbonic anhydrase (CA), glucose transporter (GLUT),
monocarboxylate transporters (MCT), and osteopontin,
which are recognized as surrogates for hypoxia in other
cancers [3–7], can reflect the hypoxic status in HCC.
Although scattered studies demonstrated ‘successful’
detection of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in HCC specimens [8, 9],
because of the extremely short half-life of these proteins, it
is hard to precisely assess the level of hypoxia in practical
clinic situations. Thus, discovery of novel hypoxia-specific
markers for HCC targeted therapies is urgently needed.
Phage display technology can be used to isolate a
specific antibody (Ab) able to bind its cognate antigen or
to internalize into tumor cells [10–15]. For the Ab phage
display, Ab fragments, corresponding to the binding site
of an immunoglobulin (Ig) either in a single-chain Fv
(scFv) or in an antigen-binding fragment (Fab) format
are fused to the pIII minor capsid protein and displayed
at the surface of the M13 filamentous phage [16–18].
Repertoires of human Ab variable (V) genes can be cloned
and used to construct a large Ab library, which can then be
used to select large panels of Abs to virtually any antigen.
Direct selection from the phage Ab library on tumor
cells provides a straightforward approach for generating
human Abs that recognizes tumor specific markers
[12, 14, 19–21]. However, this approach often yields Abs
binding to a wide range of undesired common cell surface
proteins. Optimized methods can be employed to focus
the specificity of the resultant clones on certain molecular
or cellular phenotypes. These include performing a
subtraction selection against normal cells to deplete
undesired clones prior to panning against the tumor cells
of interest, or stripping unwanted phages from the cell
surface prior to isolating those that bind the internalized
antigens [10–14].
In this study, we employed the panning approach
combining non-tumor cell depletion with normoxia
subtraction, to select against a human scFv Ab phage
library. This approach efficiently generated a panel of
phage scFv Abs that specifically bind to liver cancer
cells only under hypoxic conditions. By developing a
scFv-based immunoprecipitation method, we were able
to use liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS) to identify the antigen bound by one of the
Abs (H103) as the M2 splice isoform of pyruvate kinase
(PKM2), an enzyme that is a key regulator of aerobic
glycolysis (known as the Warburg effect) in cancer cells
[22–24]. Increased expression of the PKM2 protein is
induced by hypoxia in liver cancer cell lines, especially
in high metastatic cell lines. Immunohistochemical (IHC)
staining with the H103 scFv Ab on tissue arrays indicated
that PKM2 is highly expressed in moderately and well
differentiated HCC tissues with a hypovascular staining
pattern. High expression of PKM2 is also localized in
the perinecrotic area of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
(ICC) tissue. The percentage of PKM2 expression in liver
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancers is significantly higher with more tumor necrosis,
low microvessel density (MVD), and advanced stage.
Moreover, the H103 scFv Ab is specifically internalized
into hypoxic HCC cells and could have potential for
targeted drug delivery. Our study developed, for the first
time, a hypoxia specific scFv Ab binding to HCC by phage
library selection, and revealed that its antigen PKM2 is
a potential biomarker for hypoxia in liver cancer tissues.

RESULTS
Human scFv Ab phage display library
A large human scFv Ab phage library was created
from the Ig variable domains of 9 liver cancer patients.
Patients received different treatments, including HAL,
TAE, and TACE, and were specifically incorporated into
the library in an attempt to enhance the diversity of the
hypoxia-responding Ig gene. The prime scFv library
contains an estimated 1.5 × 109 cfu transformants. DNA
sequencing predicted that the library contains 93%
full-length scFv inserts with approximately 89% of the
total clones encoding functional open reading frames
(Figure S1A). Germline gene alignment analysis showed
that five out of the seven VH gene families were present.
VH3 comprised 39% of the clones with VH4 and VH2
representing an additional 21% of the clones. The
remainders of the clones were comprised of VH1 and VH6
(Figure S1B). This diversity is also presented for Vκ and
Vλ gene families in our scFv library (Figure S1B).

Normoxia-depleted vs hypoxia-selected library
panning
High background and low yield of positive clones
are generally associated with conventional cell-based
panning methods. We first validated that our panning
was independent of phage binding and optimized the
stripping condition to increase the yield of bound phage
clones. We found that the rescued phage scFv library more
markedly bound than a helper phage to HCCLM3 cells
(Figure S2A), and three times washing (0.5 min per time)
with 100 mM glycine/0.5 M Nacl was the best stripping
condition for selection (Figure S2B). It was reported that
cell-based panning typically results in 1–12 phages bound
per cell [11] . Based on this criterion, we reasoned that
a minimum of 107 HCCLM3 cells would be sufficient to
isolate all hypoxia-binders during the first and last steps
of selections in each round of panning. For the sake of
completely depleting the unspecific binders on the cell
surface, we carried out sequential depletions in the second
and third steps of each round of panning by incubating
a 4 × 107 pfu phage library with a 10-fold excess of
nomoxic NIH3T3 and HCCLM3 cells (Figure 1).
Despite variations both in the absolute ratio of hypoxic
to normoxic cells and in the washing stringency used,

presented the strongest hypoxia-binding activity among
these positive clones (Figure 2C, 2D), we focused on its
identifying characters in the remained of this study.

64 and 349 fold enrichments were respectively obtained
in the last two rounds of panning (Figure 2A). Significant
enrichment was also observed on the levels of the scFv Ab
phage display and soluble expression (Figure 2B). These
results indicated a selective enrichment of the hypoxiabound phage clones after four rounds of panning.

Characterization of a hypoxia-specific scFv H103
A soluble H103 scFv bearing (His) 6 tag was
produced and purified using immobilized metal affinity
chromatography (Figure 3A). The H103 scFv Ab had
much stronger binding to hypoxic HCCLM3, HepG2,
and 7721 cells than to their normoxic cultures, while this
sharp contrast of bindings was not observed on normal
liver cell 7702 and non-tumor NIH3T3 cells (Figure 3B).
We also compared the hypoxia binding of the H103
scFv Ab with the hypoxia-specific marker Ab GT12,
liver cancer specific scFv Ab H18S, and prostate cancer
specific scFv Ab E4B7S. Both H103 scFv and GT12
IgG could markedly recognize the hypoxic liver cancer
cells (binding activity: HCCLM3 > HepG2 > 7721), but
not their normoxic cultures. In contrast, H18S scFv only
weakly bound under hypoxic conditions and E4B7S scFv
showed no binding (Table S2). Next, the relative affinity
of the H103 scFv Ab was determined by flow cytometric
saturation binding assay using serial dilutions of scFv to
stain the cells. The EC50 values to reach 50% of maximum
percentage positive binding was 0.44 ug/mL for hypoxic
HCCLM3 cells but 20.67 ug/mL for normoxic ones.
The EC50 values to half-maximal GMFI also showed
a sharp-contrast, with 0.64 ug/mL for hypoxic cells and
24.12 ug/mL for normoxic ones (Figure 3C, 3D). The
calculated apparent binding constants (Ka) of the H103
scFv Ab to hypoxic cells was 2.08 × 108 M−1, which is

Selection of hypoxia binding scFv Abs
Hypoxia binders to HCCLM3 cells were initially
screened by mono-phage based flow cytometric
evaluation. 32 out of 90 clones from the last round that
displayed binding values that were three- to ten-fold above
the background control were selected. These candidate
clones in their soluble scFv form were further evaluated
by flow cytometer analysis, and 24 clones that markedly
bound to hypoxia HCCLM3 cells were validated. DNA
sequencing analysis further revealed seven unique fulllength scFv clones and the remaining seventeen clones
encoding truncated scFvs (data not shown) were removed
from further evaluation. There was a predominance of
VH germline VH4-4 and VH3-23 usage that recombined
with four different JH segments to form the rearranged
heavy chain genes. Likewise, the Vl germline V6-57
gene was predominantly used in combination with Jl2-3
segments (Table S1). A phylogenetic tree based on the
amino acid sequence of these seven scFv Abs is presented
(Figure 2E). The IMGT/V-QUEST alignment showed
that the VH and VL genes of the selected H103 scFv
Ab (GeneBank: KP347981.1) possess high homology
to the human IGHV4-4*03 and IGLV6-57*02 germline
genes, respectively (Table 1). Since the H103 scFv Ab

Figure 1: Panning procedure of the human scFv Ab phage display library. For each round of panning of the rescued phage

library, sequential selections were carried out: positive selections (+) were performed on hypoxic treated HCCLM3 cells at the first and
last steps of panning. After washing with PBST and stripping by a glycine/NaCl buffer, the hypoxic bound phages were re-infected for
propagation and forwarded to subtractive selections (−) on normoxic cultured 3T3 cells (step two) and HCCLM3 cells (step three). The
resultant sub-library was rescued again and subjected to the next round of panning.

around three fold higher than that to normoxic cultures.
These results indicate that the selected human scFv Ab
H103 specifically binds to hypoxic liver cancer cells.

E4B7 scFv, and only a minimal intracellular signal was
detected for H18s scFv (data not show). We also tested the
time-course dynamic uptake of the H103 scFv Ab by flow
cytometric measurement. Hypoxia-specific uptakes were
detected as soon as 10 minutes after the application of the
H103 phage scFv, and 20 minutes after the soluble H103
scFv was applied (Figure 4B). In addition, the hypoxic
binding of the H103 scFv Ab was remarkably impaired
by Trypsin/EDTA detachment (Figure 4C). These results
demonstrated the hypoxia-specific internalization of the
H103 scFv Ab in liver cancer cells.

Evaluation of the internalization property of the
H103 scFv Ab
Under normoxic conditions, the H103 phage Ab
gave no intracellular signal with only tiny heterogeneous
cell surface staining. In contrast, both strong cell surface
staining and intracellularly homogeneous localization
of H103 phage particles are observed in hypoxic
cells, demonstrating an efficient uptake under hypoxic
conditions (Figure 4A). Similar internalization patterns
were observed for the soluble H103 scFv Ab in hypoxic
cells, and it presented a stronger intracellular signal with
relatively less cell surface residual binding after the
uptake (Figure 4A). No uptake signal was observed for

The extracted protein that underwent LC-MS/MS
analysis unambiguously identified 11 unique peptide
sequences (Figure 5B, 5C, 5D), which matched the
PKM2 protein (NCBI accession number: P14618-1),
a cancer-preferentially-expressed M2 type isoform of
pyruvate kinase [22–24]. For independent verification, we
ectopically expressed the human PKM2/pCMV-2B plasmid
(from Fudan University) in HEK293 cells and found that
the H103 scFv Ab specifically bound to the exogenous
PKM2 protein in Western blotting (Figure 5E). Direct
blotting of H103 scFv immunoprecipitation using the
commercial anti-PKM2 Ab (C-11) gave a specific band at
58 kDa (Figure 5F). These results indicated that the H103
scFv Ab specifically recognizes the PKM2 antigen, and the
binding affinity of the H103 scFv Ab is fairly acceptable.

As the PKM2 gene was shown to be transcriptionally
activated by HIF-1a in different cell lines [22, 25], we
checked their protein levels in liver cancer cells. Hypoxiatreated HCCLM3 cells presented a time-dependent
increase (up to 16-fold) in the amounts of the PKM2
and HIF-1a protein, while the PKL protein level was not
significantly elevated (Figure 6A, 6B). Similar effects
were observed in 7721 and HepG2 cells (Figure S3B, S3C,
S3D, S3E), but not in 7702 cells (data not shown). While
hypoxia-induced PKM2 was markedly elevated, we did
not find a clear-cut upregulation of HIF-1a. The level of
the HIF-1a protein was rather reduced in HepG2 cells after
24 h hypoxic exposure (Figure S3C, S3E), which was in
accordance with other reports [26]. Immunofluorescence
analysis showed that the PKM2 staining signal was
specifically elevated after 24h hypoxic exposure while the
PKL staining signal remain unchanged in HCCLM3, 7721,
and HepG2 cells (Figure S3A). Again, a time-dependent
increase in the staining of the PKM2 protein was markedly
observed in hypoxia-treated HCCLM3 cells (Figure 6C).
These results indicated that PKM2 is a hypoxia-stimulated
protein highly expressed in liver cancer cells.

Hypoxia induces PKM2 increased expression
in vitro
Although four isoforms of pyruvate kinase (PKM1,
PKM2, PKL, and PKR) exist in mammal cells, only PKM2
and PKL were shown to exist in liver tissue [22–24].

control. (B) The uptakes of the H103 scFv Ab at different time points in hypoxic HCCLM3 cells were measured by flow cytometric analysis.

Hypoxia-specific PKM2 antigen expression
in vivo

To further confirm this phenomenon, we selected a ICC
tissue microarray with a necrotic area inside the central
bile canaliculus for staining. Although PKM2 expression
showed heterogenous and perinecrotic patterns in
the whole ICC tissue, the positive staining intensity
significantly increased with an increasing distance from
the bile capillary (/blood capillary) (Figure 8). These
results strongly indicated that hypoxia in hypovascular
regions of liver cancer tissues induce the upregulation of
PKM2 specific-expression.

IHC staining frequently revealed membranous/
cytoplasmic staining of PKM2 with strong intensity in
moderately and well differentiated HCC tissues, but
entirely negative or weak staining of PKM2 in normal liver
tissues and poorly differentiated HCC tissues (Figure 7).
To determine the relationship between tissue hypoxia and
PKM2 expression, HCC tissues with or without sinusoidal
capillarization were paired-selected for staining. PKM2
was strongly stained in hypoxic regions, which indicated
few blood vessels among different grades of HCC tissues.
This sharply contrasted with paired HCC tissues containing
numerous blood vessels, which only presented positive
staining of PKM2 in vascular endothelial cells (Figure
S4). Notably, hypoxic regions were mainly located in the
center area of cancer cell nests, especially in moderately
differentiated HCC tissues (Figure 7E, 7F, S4D).

PKM2 can serve as a hypoxic marker in HCC
and ICC
As PKM2 is highly expressed in hypovascular
HCC and perinecrotic ICC tissues, we further evaluated
the clinical relevance of PKM2 expression with patient
characteristics data provided with MTAs. As shown
in Table 2 and Table 3, tumor patients with moderately

DISCUSSION

and well differentiated grades had significantly higher
positivity for PKM2 than those with a poorly differentiated
stage (88.41% vs 43.75% in HCC, P < 0.01; 74.47% vs
40% in ICC, P < 0.01). For ICC patients, tumors with
an advanced stage (T3 + T4) had a significantly higher
positivity for PKM2 than those with a lower stage
(80% vs 28.89%, P < 0.01). However, in HCC patients,
tumors with a lower stage (T1 + T2) had a significantly
higher positivity for PKM2 than those with an advanced
stage (84.72% vs 46.15%, P < 0.01). Tissue PKM2
positivity was not significantly different in ICC patients
with regional lymph node or distant metastasis and those
without metastasis (P = 0.1459, P = 0.1266 respectively).
Strikingly, both HCC and ICC patients with no vascular
invasion in their tumor tissues had a significantly higher
positivity for PKM2 than those with vascular invasion
(86.08% vs 26.66% in HCC, P < 0.01; 60.4% vs 22.22% in
ICC, P < 0.05). Furthermore, a higher positivity of PKM2
expression was significantly detected in ICC patients with
intra-tumoral necrosis than those without (91.66% vs
52.27%, P < 0.01). The perinecrotic high expression of
PKM2 in ICC mirrors the situation in hypovascular HCC
tissue, and agrees with the fact that increased expression
of PKM2 in liver cancer cells is induced by hypoxia. All
these results collectively support the potential of PKM2
serving as a hypoxia marker in HCC and ICC.

Conventional cell-based panning methods typically
yield phage Abs specific for a wide range of undesired cell
surface proteins, not just those that are associated with a
defined cell phenotype as is the case with hypoxia in this
study. In general, most hypoxia-responding proteins are
not membrane antigens in cancer cells such as markers
of angiogenesis, stromal antigens, and intracellular
proteins released at sites of necrosis [21]. This brought
difficulties to the original cell-based panning, especially
when the targeted antigen is lowly expressed. Previous
reports utilized cell sorting methods to isolate Abs bound
with the desired molecular phenotype [15] [20]. Although
successful, these approaches are limited by the prerequisite
of known markers or Cell Tracker dye available to label
the defined phenotype, besides the complexity of the
sorting technique and expensive equipment. Therefore,
selecting appropriate cell lines that express all the
normal ‘housekeeping’ proteins but lack the phenotypeassociated antigen for use in library depletion steps is
vital for hypoxia panning. For the selections in this study,
aliquots of normoxic NIH3T3 and HCCLM3 cells were
sequentially utilized to deplete the Ab library after positive
selection of hypoxic HCCLM3 cells in the first step of
panning (Figure 1). This allows the maximum depletion

of scFv clones that are specific for other proteins naturally
present on the cells, and also decreases the likelihood that
desired scFv clones would be lost during the panning.
More particularly, our method involves the optimization of
washing conditions to achieve an acceptable signal/noise
ratio (Figure S2) and decent positive yield (Figure 2A). All
of these efforts finally produced the isolation of hypoxiabinding scFv Abs.
Low affinity of isolated clones are a common issue
with cell-based selections that can sometimes be resolved
by combining less stringency in the early rounds of
selection with greater stringency in the later rounds. We
explored this attempt but failed to isolate hypoxia specific
scFvs with high affinity (data not shown), suggesting
that this may be related to the scFv Ab itself contained in
prime library. Actually, the affinity of the H103 scFv Ab
bound with hypoxic HCCLM3 cells is quite acceptable

(2.08 × 108 M−1), and it also works well in Western blot
(Figure 5E), IHC staining (Figures 7, S4, 8), and scFvbased immunoprecipitation (Figure 5A). Similar to
previous findings [12], immunoprecipitation using NiNTA agarose, which captures H103 scFv via its (His)6
tag, led to unspecific precipitation of many intracellular
proteins, that complicated the antigen identification by
LC-MS/MS analysis. In contrast, immunoprecipitation
with protein L led to a much cleaner but relatively weak
immunoprecipitates (Figure 5A). Early study reported that
protein L is only effective in binding with certain subtypes
of kappa light chains [27]. As the VL sequence of H103
scFv matches the IGλV6-57 germline gene, the successful
immunoprecipitation by protein L in this study, suggested
that specific binding of protein L with the tertiary structure
of the H103 scFv Ab may exist, which accounts for their
selective binding.

PKM2 is the prototypic isoform of pyruvate kinase,
and is gradually replaced by the PKL isoform during liver
cell differentiation [24]. Previous studies reported isoform
shifts from L to M2 in hepatocarcinogenesis [33, 34],
and from M1 to M2 in other tumor formations [25, 35].
We found in this study that hypoxia induces increased
expression of the PKM2 protein, but not PKL or PKM1
in liver cancer cell lines (Figures 6, S3). This mirrors
the early observation that PKM2 mRNA is up-regulated
in hypoxia-treated hepatoma cells [36]. There are three
possible mechanism underlying PKM2 overexpression
in hypoxic cells. First, SP3 binding sites were found in
the PKM promoter and expression of SP3 represses
PKM promoter activity. Hypoxia removes the associated
transcriptional repression by down-regulating SP3, and
thereby activates PKM expression [37]. Second, a new
hypoxia response element (HRE) was found in intron 1
of PKM2, but not PKM1. Hypoxia strongly mediates the
transcription of PKM2 by enhancing the HIF1a DNAbinding activity and recruiting p300 to HREs [38, 39].
Third, PKM2, acting in a feedback loop, directly interacts
with HIF1a and promotes transactivation of HIF1a
downstream genes. The interaction between PKM2 and

Pyruvate kinase, as a cytoplasmic enzyme, is
generally not expected to localize at the cell surface.
However, the specific binding of the H103 scFv Ab to
hypoxic cells (Figures 2C, 2D, 3B, 4A, 4C; Table S2) and
its antigen PKM2 identification based on cell surfacebiotinylation (Figure 5) in this study, both support that a
fraction of PKM2 protein did present on the hypoxic liver
cancer cell surface. This result is in line with a previous
report that a cryptic signal peptide directs the transport of
pyruvate kinase to the cell surface [28]. In addition, PKM2
was shown to bind with tumor endothelial marker 8, which
is located on the endothelial cell surface [19]. It also binds
with the cell surface adhesion molecule CD44 in hypoxic
cancer stem cells [29]. Furthermore, accumulating
studies show that apoptotic agents or hypoxic stress can
induce PKM2 translocation to the nucleus, suggesting its
dynamic subcellular trafficking in response to different
microenvironmental stimuli [30–32]. These observations
together with our present results collectively suggest that
hypoxia may induce PKM2 translocation to the surface of
cancer cells and binding with the H103 scFv Ab triggers
endocytosis. This will benefit hypoxia-specific targeted
therapies in liver cancer.

findings: one is that PKM2 expression is upregulated in
PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation and that
PKM2 silencing inhibits its differentiation in leukemia [36].
The other is the interaction of PKM2 with Oct4, a major
regulator of self-renewal and differentiation in stem cells,
decreases the transcriptional activity of Oct4 for ‘stemness’
maintaining of glioma stem cells and thus induces
differentiation [37]. Nevertheless, some contradictory
results need attention, with one study demonstrating the
high PKM2 expression in poorly differentiated esophageal
squamous cell cancer tissues [38], another showing
that PKM2 promotes OCT4 expression in hypoxic
hESCs and also enhances its transcriptional activity by
binding to OCT4 [42]. Given that PKM2 can promote
cell proliferation by interaction with a lot of molecules
(e.g. histone 1, STAT3, b-catenin) and direct cell
differentiation via its interaction with Oct4 [22, 43], it is
tempting to assume that PKM2 might function as a key
balancer between a hypoxia-promoted growth/survival
phenotype and a hypoxia-mediated dedifferentiation
phenotype in HCC, both of which need PKM2 high

HIF1a is mediated by the PHD3-dependent hydroxylation
of PKM2. Because both PKM and EGLN3 (encoding
PHD3) are HIF1a target genes, the positive feedback loop
that promotes HIF1a activity maintains overexpression of
PKM2 and other glycolytic genes [39], which accelerates
metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells and may be an
alternative salvage pathway to supply ATP to promote
hypoxic HCC growth or survival.
The reason why PKM2 is highly expressed in
moderately differentiated HCC, but weakly expressed
in poorly differentiated HCC (Figure 7E, 7F; Table 2)
is largely unknown. Many studies revealed that hypoxia
can inhibit tumor cell differentiation and may maintain
undifferentiated “stem cell-like” phenotypes, mediated
by HIF-controlled stem cell genes up-regulation and
differentiation genes down-regulation [40, 41]. Thus,
hypoxia-induced PKM2 high expression should be
markedly observed in poorly differentiated HCC. However,
in this study, we only found that PKM2 is highly expressed
in moderately differentiated HCC (Figure 7E, 7F;
Table 2). This is somewhat in line with two previous

expression to activate numerous transcription factors
downstream of HiF1a. This postulation is currently being
investigated in our laboratory.
The potential role of PKM2 as a hypoxia marker for
HCC and ICC is indicated by its significant associations
with necrosis (Figure 8; Tables 2, 3). Although showing
heterogeneous distribution, high expression of PKM2
in ICC tumors is virtually restricted to regions directly
adjacent to areas of necrosis. Furthermore, we found
that PKM2 high expression in HCC is closely associated
with aggressive pathological features, including high
tumor grade and lymph node or distant metastasis.
These findings are in accord with recently reports that
overexpression of PKM2 contributes to the aggressiveness
and poor prognosis of HCC [44, 45]. Taken together, it
may be plausible that hypoxia and tumor necrosis are
biologically associated, and PKM2 prognostically serves
as a hypoxia marker for invasive liver cancer. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing
that PKM2 is a hypoxia marker in cancers. Further work
with large cohorts of cancer patients is needed to confirm
this finding. The present study also showed that PKM2
expression is correlated with the absence of vascular
invasion in HCC and ICC (Figure S4; Tables 2, 3). This
finding appears to be in contradiction with recent reports
showing the associations of PKM2 overexpression with
microvascular invasion in HCC tumors [34, 44, 45] and
with a higher number of MVD in human biliary tract
cancer [46]. The discrepancy between our results and
others may be because of the limited cases of tissue array
included in this study. Further study with expanded liver
cancer patients and function investigation of PKM2 on
liver cancer angiogenesis are needed.
In summary, this study, for the first time, developed
a human scFv Ab H103 bound specifically with hypoxic
liver cancers cells, and found that its antigen PKM2 is a
promising biomarker for hypoxia in HCC and ICC tissues.
Our findings indicated that direct selection of the phage
Ab against the tumor hypoxia phenotype can provide an
efficient approach for the discovery of a tumor metabolic
marker at the protein level.

The human scFv Ab library was constructed as
previously described [16]. Briefly, human Ig VH(G + M),
VLκ, and VLλ gene family pools were PCR amplified
from PBMC of liver cancer patients. Gel-purified
gene mixtures of IgVH(G:M = 1:1), IgVL(κ:λ = 2:1),
and (Gly4Ser)3 (H-κ, H-λ) linker were three-fragment
assembled into a scFv repertoire using splicing overlap
extension PCR, re-amplified to append restriction sites
(Sfi 1 & Not 1), then subcloned into the pCANTAB 6his
plasmid (substitute E-tag in pCANTAB 5E to 6 × His tag),
and electro-transformed into E. coli TG1 to generate a
scFv library in bacterial form.
Gene diversity in the library was determined by
sequencing 30 randomly selected clones and was analyzed
using the IMGT/V-QUEST online program (http://
imgt.cines.fr/textes/vquest/). Phage Abs were prepared
using M13K07 helper rescue followed by PEG-NaCI
precipitation. The size and titer of the scFv Ab library
were measured as previously described [17, 18].

Panning and screening of hypoxia binding
scFv Abs
(1) Subtractive and positive selections: The
procedure (Figure 1) was similar to that previously
described [10]. Positive selection was performed on
hypoxia-treated (300 uM Cocl2) HCCLM3 cells by
incubating 1 × 107 PBS/EDTA-detached cells with
3 × 108 pfu of the library at 4°C for 1 h. Bound phages
were stripped by glycine/NaCl buffer (pH 2.5) then
neutralized with 1 M Tris (pH 7.4). Subtractive selection
was performed by incubating 4 × 108 3T3 and HCCLM3
cells with 4 × 107 pfu of the phage library. The final sublibrary in each round was rescued again and subjected
to the next round of panning. (2) Flow cytometry-based
clone screening: phage-scFv and the soluble scFv Ab
(periplasmic extract of scFv-phage-infected HB2151 E.
coli cells) from individual clones were rocking-incubated
with hypoxic cells (PBS/EDTA detached) at 4°C for 1 h.
Bound phage scFv Abs were detected by adding a mixture
of biotinylated anti-M13 McAb (1:600, Sigma) and
streptavidin-AF488 (1:1000, Molecular Probes). Bound
soluble scFv Abs were detected by addition of a mixture
of mouse anti-his mAb (1/300) with AF488 conjugated
goat anti-mouse pcAb (1/1000, Molecular Probes).
The fluorescence was measured in a FACScalibur (BD
Biosciences). E4B7S (anti-γ-seminoprotein) and H18S
(anti-CD147) scFv Abs [17, 18] were used as controls.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and hypoxia treatment
Human liver cancer cells 7721, HepG2, HCCLM3,
hepatocyte cell 7702, embryonic kidney cell 293, and
mouse embryo fibroblast 3T3 were obtained from China
Infrastructure of Cell Line Resources (http://cellresource.

Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C with 5% CO2. For hypoxia
treatment, cells were exposed to 100–300 μM CoCl2 in
DMEM containing 1% FBS for 6–24 hours depending on
the specific assay aim.

column was a home-made fused silica capillary column
(75 μm ID, 150 mm length; Upchurch) packed with C-18
resin (300 Å, 5 μm, Varian). Mobile phase A consisted
of 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of
100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The Q Exactive
mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent
acquisition mode using Xcalibur 2.1.2 software. There
was a single full-scan mass spectrum in the orbitrap
(400–1800 m/z, 60,000 resolution) followed by 10 datadependent MS/MS scans at 27% normalized collision
energy (HCD). The MS/MS spectra were searched against
the human.fasta from UniProt (March 19, 2014) using an
in-house Proteome Discoverer (Version PD1.4).

BL-21 (DE3) pLysS E. coli cells were shake cultured in
LB medium (1 mM IPTG, 100 ug/ml ampicillin, 34 ug/
ml chloramphenicol) for 6 h at 37°C. Bacteria pellets
were harvested and sonicated in lysis buffer (50 nM
Tris-HCl, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mM PMSF, pH 8.0).
Inclusion bodies were completely solubilized in 8 M
urea denaturation buffer, centrifuged at 30,000 × g for
20 min, and the supernatant was loaded on a His Bind
resin column (GE Healthcare). The bound scFv Ab was
eluted and then dialyzed against refolding buffer I (50 mM
Tris-HCl, 2 M urea, 2 mM reduced glutathione, 0.2 mM
oxidized glutathione, pH 8.0) and refolding buffer II
(50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The scFv protein
was concentrated using an Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter
unit (Millipore) and its purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE
followed by Coomassie blue staining.

Evaluation of internalization by confocal
microscope and flow cytometry

Affinity purification of the cognate antigen

Cells were incubated with either phage-scFv or
soluble scFv Abs in serum-free DMEM at 37°C for 1 h.
After washing with cold PBS/1M NaCl to remove
surface-bound scFvs, cells were fixed in 3.7 % (w/v)
paraformaldehyde at RT for 10 min. To check the uptake
of phage-scFvs, cells were blocked in 2% (v/v) goat
serum, permeabilized with 0.2% (w/v) saponin for 15 min,
incubated with mouse anti-M13 Ab (1:400) at RT for
1 h, washed three times with 1% BSA/PBS, and finally
detected after 1 h incubation with AF488-conjugated antimouse Ab (1:1000). The uptake of soluble scFv Abs was
similarly detected but with mouse anti-His (1:300) as the
prime Ab. After nuclear staining with DAPI (1:1000), the
cells were mounted and images were acquired using an
Olympus FV 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope.
The binding of scFv Abs at 4°C was checked as described
above, without PBS/1M NaCl rinsing and saponinpermeabilization.
For flow cytometry-based uptake measurement,
the soluble scFv Ab (1:20), mouse anti-His (1:300), and
goat anti-mouse-AF488 Ab (1:500) were pre-complexed
in serum-free DMEM at 20°C for 30 min (scFv-AF488
complex) and then incubated with cells at 37°C for
10 min-1 h. The uptake of phage-scFvs was measured
by addition of a pre-complex consisting of phage-scFv
Abs (1:30), biotinylated anti-M13 McAb (1:600), and
streptavidin-AF488 (1:1000). Cells were then trypsinized,
washed, and immediately live-analyzed. Controls without
scFv Abs were included in all experiments. The binding
of the pre-complexes with PBS/EDTA- or Trypsin/
EDTA detached cells at 4°C were similarly measured as
described above.

Hypoxic HCCLM3 cells were surface-labeled with
0.1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). After washing
with PBS-glycine (50 mM), cells were PBS/EDTA
detached and the lysates were depleted by incubation
with either protein L (Santa Cruz) or Ni-NTA-agarose
(Quiagen) for 1 h. Depleted lysates were incubated
with the scFv Ab (4 ug per ml) at 4°C overnight and the
immune complexes were captured by protein L or Ni-NTA
agarose. The captured immune complexes were washed
with lysis buffer or eluted using 200 mM imidazole, and
then resolved by 1D SDS-PAGE in duplicate. One gel
was blotted with HRP conjugated streptavidin (Jackson),
the other gel was stained with Coomassie blue, and the
specific protein bands were excised with reference to
Western blot.

Sample preparation and LC-MS/MS analysis
The excised gel bands of interest were reduced with
25 mM of DTT and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide.
In gel digestion was then carried out with sequencing
grade modified trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate
at 37°C overnight. The peptides were extracted twice with
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile aqueous
solution for 30 min. Tryptic peptides were re-dissolved
in 50 μL 200 mM Tetraethylammonium Bromide, and
2 μL TMT sixplex labeling reagent (Thermo) was added
to each sample. The reaction was incubated for 1 hour at
RT. Then, 0.5 μl of 5% hydroxylamine (pH 9) was added
to the reaction mixture and incubated for 15 minutes to
quench the reaction. Equal amounts of labeled samples
from both immunoprecipitations were combined and
analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
For LC-MS/MS analysis, the TMT-labeled peptides
were separated by a 65 min gradient elution at a flow rate
0.250 μl/min with a Thermo-Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC
system, which was directly interfaced with a Thermo
