Abstract
Here, we show that new mitochondrial biogenesis is required for the anchorage
independent survival and propagation of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). More
specifically, we used the drug XCT790 as an investigational tool, as it functions as a
specific inhibitor of the ERRα-PGC1 signaling pathway, which governs mitochondrial
biogenesis. Interestingly, our results directly demonstrate that XCT790 efficiently
blocks both the survival and propagation of tumor initiating stem-like cells (TICs),
using the MCF7 cell line as a model system. Mechanistically, we show that XCT790
suppresses the activity of several independent signaling pathways that are normally
required for the survival of CSCs, such as Sonic hedgehog, TGFβ-SMAD, STAT3, and
Wnt signaling. We also show that XCT790 markedly reduces oxidative mitochondrial
metabolism (OXPHOS) and that XCT790-mediated inhibition of CSC propagation can be
prevented or reversed by Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR), a mitochondrial fuel. Consistent
with our findings, over-expression of ERRα significantly enhances the efficiency of
mammosphere formation, which can be blocked by treatment with mitochondrial
inhibitors. Similarly, mammosphere formation augmented by FOXM1, a downstream
target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, can also be blocked by treatment with three
different classes of mitochondrial inhibitors (XCT790, oligomycin A, or doxycycline).
In this context, our unbiased proteomics analysis reveals that FOXM1 drives the
expression of >90 protein targets associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, glycolysis,
the EMT and protein synthesis in MCF7 cells, processes which are characteristic of an
anabolic CSC phenotype. Finally, doxycycline is an FDA-approved antibiotic, which is
very well-tolerated in patients. As such, doxycycline could be re-purposed clinically
as a ‘safe’ mitochondrial inhibitor, to target FOXM1 and mitochondrial biogenesis in
CSCs, to prevent tumor recurrence and distant metastasis, thereby avoiding patient
relapse.

Introduction

propagation and survival of TICs.
Here, our results show that XCT790 inhibits the
proliferation of TICs from MCF7 breast cancer cells,
as assessed using i) mammosphere formation and by
ii) CD44/CD24 immuno-staining, coupled with FACS
analysis. We also demonstrate that XCT790 suppresses
the activation of well-established pathways governing
TIC proliferation and survival, including Sonic hedgehog,
TGFβ-SMAD, STAT3, and Wnt signaling. As expected,
XCT790 profoundly reduced mitochondrial respiration.
Importantly, XCT790-induced TIC inhibition could be
rescued by treatment with Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR),
a mitochondrial fuel and cofactor, which enhances
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and biogenesis [20].
We also show that overexpression of ERRα is sufficient
to augment MCF7 cell mammosphere formation, which
can be blocked by treatment with mitochondrial inhibitors,
such as XCT790 and oligomycin A, an inhibitor of ATP
synthase. Finally, we show that mammosphere formation
driven by FOXM1, a transcription factor downstream of
Wnt/β-catening signaling that governs stemness [21-24],
can also be blocked by treatment with three different
classes of mitochondrial inhibitors (XCT790, oligomycin
A, or doxycycline).
Thus, our results firmly establish that mitochondrial
biogenesis and metabolism are required for the survival
of TICs, indicating that mitochondrial-targeted therapies
are a promising novel strategy for targeting TICs for the
treatment of relapsed and resistant cancers. Mitochondrialtargeted therapies should also be considered for cancer
prevention.

Tumor-initiating stem-like cells (TICs) are a small
sub-population of tumor cells that are resistant to most
anti-cancer therapies, including radio- and chemotherapy,
and are able to expand and regenerate tumors, after
conventional therapy is completed [1-4]. As such, TICs are
responsible for tumor recurrence, metastatic dissemination,
and, ultimately, patient death. As a consequence, TICs
have become very attractive targets for novel cancer
therapies. TICs share some features with stem cells, and
many studies have investigated the signaling pathways
regulating their proliferation, asymmetric cell division and
migrating properties, as well as their ability to undergo
proliferation under anchorage-independent conditions [57]. In fact, this latter property is being widely exploited
to isolate TICs, which are able to survive and clonally
expand as tumor-spheres, when placed in non-adherent
settings [8]. Tumor-spheres generated from breast cancer
cells are known as mammospheres.
The metabolic requirements of TICs remain a fairly
unexplored area of investigation. We and others have
recently shown that TICs rely mainly on mitochondrial
metabolism, as compared to the more differentiated tumor
cell population [9-12]. Also, it was previously shown
that the radio-resistance of TICs from gliomas [13] and
breast cancers [14] correlates with higher mitochondrial
respiration.
We have demonstrated that >60 mitochondrial
proteins are up-regulated in mammospheres derived from
breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D), relative to
cells grown in monolayers. Furthermore, pharmacological
inhibition with oligomycin A, an inhibitor of the ATP
synthase, greatly reduced mammosphere formation [11].
More importantly, treatment with doxycycline, an FDAapproved antibiotic targeting mitochondrial ribosomes as
a known ‘side effect’, inhibited the formation of tumorspheres generated from cell lines across several different
tumor types, as well as from primary tumor samples [12].
These studies indicate that mitochondria in TICs are
potentially druggable targets for the prevention of tumor
recurrence and metastasis. The aim of our current study
was to further validate mitochondrial function as a critical
target for the development of new anti-cancer therapies.
Here, we employed XCT790 as an investigational
compound to inhibit mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation [15]. XCT790 is a well-established
inverse agonist of Estrogen-Related Receptor α (ERRα),
which functions as an essential cofactor of PGC1α.
Importantly, PGC1α is required for the transcription
of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and drives
mitochondrial biogenesis [16, 17]. XCT790 has been
shown to inhibit colony formation in soft agar induced by
PGC1α [18], and to induce cell death in chemo-resistant
cancer cells [19]. However, to our knowledge, no studies
have previously investigated the effects of XCT790 on the

Mammosphere formation in MCF7 cells depends
on mitochondrial function
We have previously shown that mitochondrial
proteins are up-regulated in mammospheres derived from
breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D), relative to cells
grown in monolayers [11]. Furthermore, pharmacological
inhibition with oligomycin A, an inhibitor of ATP
synthase, greatly reduced mammosphere formation [11].
More importantly, treatment with doxycycline, an FDAapproved antibiotic that targets mitochondrial ribosomes
as a known ‘side effect’, inhibited the formation of tumorspheres derived from 12 cell lines across eight different
tumor types, as well as from primary tumor samples [12].
To further investigate the role of mitochondria
in TICs, here we employed a well-established inverse
agonist of ERRα, namely XCT790. ERRα is a cofactor
of PGC1α/β, which is required for the transcription
of nuclear mitochondrial genes and mitochondrial
biogenesis [16, 17]. As such, XCT790 is believed to

suppress mitochondrial function. Notably, treatment with
XCT790 dose-dependently inhibits MCF7 mammosphere
formation, with an IC-50 of 10 μM (Figure 1A). We also
validated that XCT790 dose-dependently reduces the
protein expression of PGC1α in MCF7 cell monolayers
by immuno-blot analysis (data not shown), by up to 7080%, over this concentration range.
These results were independently confirmed by
evaluating the expression of bona-fide TIC markers CD44/
CD24 by FACS. Under these conditions, CD44(+)high/
CD24(-)low cells are considered to represent the TIC
sub-population. XCT790 treatment significantly reduced

the number of CD44(+)high/CD24(-)low cells in a dosedependent fashion, relative to vehicle alone controls
(Figure 1B).
We next set out to investigate if XCT790 can target
TICs in the presence of the total cancer cell population. To
this end, MCF7 cells were treated with XCT790 (at 5 or 10
µM) as monolayers for 2 days and then re-plated on lowattachment plates in the absence of XCT790, to generate
mammospheres for 5 days. Under these conditions,
XCT790 pre-treatment dose-dependently reduced MCF7
cell mammosphere formation, by up to ~70% (Figure 1C),
indicating that XCT790 can target the TIC population also

XCT790 inhibits the activation of several stem cell
related signaling pathways

when present in a heterogeneous cell population.
Also, we asked if decreased mammosphere
formation induced by XCT790 could be rescued by
treatment with the mitochondrial cofactor AcetylL-Carnitine (ALCAR). ALCAR plays a key role in
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, by enhancing fatty
acid β-oxidation [20]. ALCAR stimulates mitochondrial
biogenesis and is also directly converted to acetyl-CoA,
a mitochondrial fuel [20]. To this end, mammosphere
formation was assessed after treatment with XCT790
(at 20 µM) and increasing concentrations of ALCAR.
Figure 1D shows that ALCAR rescues the decrease
in mammosphere formation induced by XCT790, in a
dose-dependent manner. Thus, mitochondrial function is
required for the efficient clonal expansion and anchorageindependent growth of TICs.
We then examined if XCT790 affects the viability of
the total cancer cell population, or if it specifically inhibits
the viability of MCF7 cells in mammospheres. To this end,
MCF7 cells were treated with increasing concentrations
of XCT790 as monolayers for 3 days (Figure 2A) or 5
days (Figure 2B). Cell viability was then assessed using
the SRB assay. Note that 5-day treatment did not affect
the viability of the MCF7 cell monolayers, as profoundly
as MCF7 cell mammospheres (Figure 2B). For example,
treatment with 10 µM XCT790 reduces mammosphere
formation by 50% (Figure 1A), whereas the viability
of monolayer cells is reduced by only 20%. Thus,
XCT790 preferentially reduces the viability of MCF7 cell
mammospheres, relative to bulk cancer cells.

To further corroborate the idea that XCT790 inhibits
cancer stem cell-like features, we next analyzed the effects
of XCT790 on a series of well-established signaling
pathways, which have been shown to promote stemness.
For this purpose, we employed a panel of eight MCF7 cell
lines carrying different luciferase reporters [25], to monitor
the activation state of a variety of different signaling
networks, including Sonic hedgehog, TGFβ-SMAD,
STAT3, Wnt, Interferon (IFN)-α/β-STAT1/2, NRF2dependent antioxidant responses, IFN-γ-STAT1 and Notch
pathways. Notably, several pathways were significantly
inhibited by XCT790 treatment, including stem cell
signaling (Sonic hedgehog, TGFβ-SMAD, STAT3, Wnt)
and IFN-α/β-STAT1/2 signaling (Figure 3A). However, no
effects were observed on the NRF2-antioxidant response,
IFN-γ-STAT1 and the Notch pathways (Figure 3B).
Thus, XCT790 inhibits the activation of several signal
transduction pathways related to cancer stem-like features.

XCT790 inhibits mitochondrial respiration
Next, we set out to investigate the mechanism(s) by
which XCT790 inhibits mammosphere formation and CSC
features. XCT790 is an inverse agonist of ERRα, which
is a cofactor of PGC1α required for the transcription of
mitochondrial genes and mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus,
the metabolic profile of MCF7 cells treated with XCT790
was analyzed. To this end, MCF7 cells were treated with
XCT790 for 48 hours, stained with various MitoTracker

MCF7 cells were treated with XCT790 (1, 5, 10, 20 μM) as monolayers for 3 days A. or 5 days B. Cell viability was assessed by SRB
assay. Note that 5-day treatment did not affect the viability of the MCF7 cell monolayers as profoundly as MCF7 cell mammospheres. For
example, treatment with 10 μM XCT790 reduces mammosphere formation by 50% (Figure 1A), whereas viability of monolayer cells is
reduced by 20%. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 evaluated by Student’s t test.

ERRα expression is both necessary and sufficient
to increase mammosphere formation in MCF7
cells

probes and analyzed by FACS. Figure 4A shows that
XCT790 induces a decrease in mitochondrial membrane
potential, as assessed with MitoTracker Orange, which
accumulates in mitochondria with an active mitochondrial
potential. Surprisingly, XCT790 induces also an increase
in mitochondrial mass, as assessed with MitoTracker
Green (Figure 4B), localizing to mitochondria regardless
of mitochondrial membrane potential. Similar results
were obtained with MitoTracker Deep Red, which also
measures mitochondria mass (data not shown). Analysis
of the ratio of mitochondrial membrane potential versus
mitochondrial mass indicates that XCT790 induces a
profound decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential
per mitochondria (Figure 4C).
Also, the metabolic profile of MCF7 cells treated
with XCT790 was examined using the Seahorse XFe96
analyzer, by employing a mitochondrial stress test.
Notably, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was greatly
reduced by treatment with XCT790 (Figure 5A). Further
quantification revealed significant reductions in basal and
maximal respiration (Figure 5B-5C), as well as ATP levels
(Figure 5D), upon XCT790 treatment. Thus, XCT790
significantly reduces the rates of oxidative mitochondrial
metabolism. To further validate these results, a glycolytic
stress test was performed using the Seahorse XFe96
analyzer, by measuring the extracellular acidification rate
(ECAR) of MCF7 cells treated with XCT790. Notably,
XCT790 also significantly reduces ECAR, a marker of
glycolysis (Figure 6A). Finally, plotting the ratio of OCR
to ECAR demonstrates that XCT790 shifts MCF7 cells
from a highly energetic to a metabolically quiescent state
(Figure 6B).

XCT790 is an inverse agonist of ERRα. As XCT790
inhibits mammosphere formation, we then asked if ERRα
expression is sufficient to promote 3D-spheroid formation
in MCF7 cells. To this end, ERRα was over-expressed
in MCF7 cells using a lentiviral approach. Empty Vector
(EV) cells were generated in parallel. Figure 7A shows that
MCF7 cells over-expressing ERRα show a 50% increase
in mammosphere forming capacity. Notably, MCF7 cells
over-expressing ERRα show increased mitochondrial
membrane potential, as assessed by MitoTracker Orange,
as well as increased mitochondrial mass, as assessed
by MitoTracker Green and MitoTracker Deep Red, as
expected (Figure 7B).
We then used a pharmacological approach to inhibit
ERRα-driven mammosphere formation, using oligomycin
A, a mitochondrial inhibitor, as well as XCT790, a specific
ERRα inverse agonist. Importantly, mammosphere
formation induced by ERRα expression was inhibited
by either treatment with oligomycin A (Figure 7C), or
XCT790 (Figure 7D). These results indicate that ERRα
activity and mitochondrial function are normally required
for the clonal expansion of TICs.

Mammosphere formation driven by FOXM1

To examine if mitochondrial function is essential
for TIC expansion driven by well-established stemlike signaling, we decided to overexpress FOXM1 in

metabolic flexibility. Notably, keratin-19 (KRT19), a
well-established marker of circulating tumor cells and
CSCs, is increased by >20-fold in MCF7-FOXM1 cells.
Also, four key mitochondrial proteins (HSPD1, ACADVL,
ATP5B, COX4I1) are increased by >10-fold each in
MCF7-FOXM1 cells; SLC25A4 (the mitochondrial ATP/
ADP exchanger) is increased by nearly 6-fold. Similarly,
twenty-two other mitochondrial proteins are increased by
>1.5 fold.
Moreover, Table 2 shows that several key molecules
related to protein synthesis are also up-regulated in
FOXM1-overexpressing MCF7 cells. We have previously
shown that protein synthesis is a mechanism for enhancing
the proliferation of TICs, and that known inhibitors of
protein synthesis, such as puromycin and rapamycin, are
very effective at reducing mammosphere formation [27].
Similarly, the EMT is also regarded as a key feature of
TICs [28, 29]. Consistent with the notion that FOXM1
drives stemness, ribosome-related proteins and EMT
markers are increased by FOXM1 expression (Tables 1
and 2).

MCF7 cells. Empty Vector (EV) control cells were
generated in parallel. The transcription factor FOXM1
was recently shown to induce the expansion of human
normal stem cells, as well as of cancer stem-like cells
[21-24]. Mechanistically, it is believed that FOXM1 acts
downstream of key signaling pathways essential for stem
cell regulation and tumorigenesis, such as Wnt/β-catenin
and 14-3-3ζ signaling cells [22, 26].
MCF7 cells over-expressing FOXM1 show a 3.3fold increase in mammosphere formation, relative to
empty-vector controls, as expected (Figure 8A). In order
to better dissect the molecular changes driven by FOXM1,
MCF7 cell monolayers over-expressing FOXM1 and
EV control cells were subjected to proteomics analysis.
Proteomic datasets of up-regulated proteins in the MCF7FOXM1 cells were then analyzed with respect to their
metabolic protein profiles.

To test if mitochondrial inhibitors could block
FOXM1-driven mammosphere formation, we then
used several independent pharmacological approaches.
Interestingly, formation of FOXM1-driven mammospheres
was inhibited by treatment with oligomycin A (Figure
8B), XCT790 (Figure 8C), and doxycycline (Figure

we have recently shown to inhibit proliferation of TICs,
by targeting their mitochondrial ribosomes [12]. Thus,

Discussion

cell lines, indicating that the ability of XCT790 to inhibit
3D-spherioid formation reflects a general property of
CSCs (data not shown).

Here, we specifically tested the hypothesis that new
mitochondrial biogenesis is required for the survival and
propagation of stem-like cancer cells. For this purpose, we
used an investigational inhibitor of the ERRα-PGC1α/β
signaling pathway, namely XCT790, to interrogate the role
of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in the anchorageindependent growth of CSCs. Importantly, treatment with
XCT790 blocked mammosphere formation and prevented
anoikis-resistance in CD44(+)high/CD24(-)low MCF7
cells. Mechanistically, XCT790 inhibited mitochondrial
function (OCR) and effectively reduced signaling along
a number of classical stem cell transduction pathways,
such as the Hedgehog/GLI, TGFβ/SMAD, and Wnt/βcatenin signaling. Overexpression of either ERRα or
FOXM1 (a down-stream target of Wnt-signaling [22])
in MCF7 cells significantly augmented mammosphere
formation, which could be prevented by a number of
mitochondrial inhibitors. In this regard, doxycycline
treatment was sufficient to overcome the effects of
FOXM1 on mammosphere formation. Interestingly,
doxycycline is an FDA-approved antibiotic that has
been used for nearly 50 years to treat a wide variety of
bacterial and parasitic infections, without significant
side effects. Finally, unbiased proteomics analysis of

Relevance of FOXM1-related targets in human
breast cancers
To assess the possible clinical relevance of our
results, we also determined whether the proteomic
targets that we identified in MCF7-FOXM1 cells were
transcriptionally over-expressed in human breast cancer
cells in vivo. Towards this end, we exploited a clinical data
set of tumor samples from 28 breast cancer patients. These
tumor samples were subjected to laser-capture microdissection, to separate epithelial cancer cells from adjacent
tumor stroma [30].
Tables 3 and 4 present a summary of these findings.
Overall, greater than fifty FOXM1 targets (related to

transcriptionally elevated in human breast cancer cells
in vivo. As such, the new FOXM1 protein targets that
we identified in MCF7-FOXM1 cells may be especially
relevant for improving human breast cancer diagnosis and

MCF7-FOXM1 cells revealed the up-regulation of
specific mitochondrial proteins, glycolytic enzymes,
EMT markers and components of the protein synthesis
machinery. Importantly, these FOXM1 target proteins
were also transcriptionally up-regulated in patient samples
in vivo, in human breast cancer epithelial cells isolated by
laser-capture micro-dissection, highlighting their clinical
relevance.
Many other recent studies have also directly
implicated augmented mitochondrial function in resistance
to chemotherapy and radiation [31-36], in the survival
of treatment-resistant cancer stem-like cells [37], in the
propagation and motility of circulating tumor cells [38],
as well as in tumor growth and cancer cell metastasis in
pre-clinical animal models in vivo [39-44].
Consistent with our current findings, we have
previously shown that a PGC1/NRF1 gene signature
predicts tumor recurrence, metastasis and poor overall
survival in ER(+)/Luminal-A breast cancer patients [45].
This PGC1/NRF1 gene signature was also elevated in
>2,000 human tumors excised from breast cancer patients,
including both ER(+)and ER(-) cases [45]. Moreover,

recombinant over-expression of PGC1α/β, or other genes
that promote mitochondrial biogenesis (MitoNEET/
POLRMT), in MDA-MB-231 cells, was indeed sufficient
to functionally increase tumor growth by up to ~3-fold
[43].
Asymmetric cell division is an essential
characteristic of stem cells. Interestingly, Sabatini,
Weinberg and colleagues examined the segregation
of “newly-synthesized” and “older” mitochondria
in immortalized mammary epithelial cells, during
asymmetric cell division, a property that is also a
characteristic of CSCs [46]. They observed that “newlysynthesized” mitochondria were preferentially enriched in
stem cells during asymmetric cell division, while “old”
mitochondria were segregated into the daughter cells [46].
These results imply that asymmetric cell division in stem
cells somehow requires new mitochondrial biogenesis,
for the propagation and maintenance of the stem cell
phenotype.
As such, these findings may help to mechanistically
explain our current results that new mitochondrial
biogenesis is required for the efficient propagation of and

Figure 10: Understanding the role of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in the propagation of CSCs/TICs. ERRα

is a co-factor for PGC1α/β, which is a well-established transcription factor that is critical for driving new mitochondrial biogenesis. Here,
we show that three different classes of mitochondrial inhibitors (XCT790, oligomycin A and doxycycline) all prevent the propagation of
CSCs/TICs. XCT790 is an inverse agonist of ERRα. Oligomycin A is an inhibitor of the mitochondrial ATP-synthase (complex V) (not
shown). Finally, doxycycline is an inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis, as it binds directly to the small subunit of the mitochondrial
ribosome. This reflects the fact that mitochondria were originally derived from aerobic bacteria that evolved over millions of years, to
establish a symbiotic relationship with the host cell. The chemical structures of XCT790 and doxycycline are also shown.

tumor recurrence, distant metastasis and drug-resistance,
especially in cancer patients with clinically advanced
disease.

XCT790.

Lentiviruses
Lentiviral plasmids, packaging cells and reagents
were from Genecopoeia. 48 hours after seeding, 293Ta
packaging cells were transfected with lentiviral vectors
encoding ERRα, FOXM1 or empty vector (EX-NEGLv105), using Lenti-PacTM HIV Expression Packaging
Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two days
post-transfection, lentivirus-containing culture medium
was passed through a 0.45 µm filter and added to the target
cells (MCF7 cells) in the presence of 5µg/ml Polybrene.
Infected cells were selected with a concentration of 1.5 µg/
ml of puromycin.

Materials and Methods
Materials
MCF7 breast cancer cells were purchased from
the ATCC. H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells were
a generous gift of Dr. Antonio Stigliano (University of
Rome). Gibco-brand cell culture media (DMEM/F12)
was purchased from Life Technologies. XCT790 was
purchased from Tocris, oligomycin A and doxycycline
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lentiviral vectors
for the expression of ERRα (#Z1441) and FOXM1
(#U1376) were obtained commercially from Genecopoeia,
along with the appropriate empty vector controls, in the
Lv-105 (PuroR) vector system.

CD44/CD24 analysis
Following XCT790 treatment for 48 hours, the TIC
population was enriched by seeding on low-attachment
plates. Under these conditions, the non-TIC population
undergoes anoikis (a form of apoptosis induced by a
lack of cell-substrate attachment) and TICs are believed
to survive. The surviving TIC fraction was analyzed by
FACS analysis. Briefly, 1 x 104 MCF7 monolayer cells
were treated with XCT790 (5μM and 10 μM) for 48h in
6-well plates. Then, cells were trypsinized and seeded in
low-attachment plates in mammosphere media. After 10h,
MCF7 cells were spun down and incubated with CD24
(IOTest CD24-PE, Beckman Coulter) and CD44 (APC
mouse Anti-Human CD44, BD Pharmingen cat.559942)
antibodies for 15 minutes on ice. Cells were rinsed twice
and incubated with LIVE/DEAD dye (Fixable Dead Violet
reactive dye; Invitrogen) for 10 minutes. Samples were
then analyzed by FACS (Fortessa, BD Bioscence). Only
the live population, as identified by the LIVE/DEAD dye
staining, was analyzed for CD24/CD44 expression. Data
were analyzed using FlowJo software.

Mammosphere culture
A single cell suspension was prepared using
enzymatic (1x Trypsin-EDTA, Sigma Aldrich, #T3924),
and manual disaggregation (25 gauge needle) to create
a single cell suspension [8]. Cells were plated at a
density of 500 cells/cm2 in mammosphere medium
(DMEM-F12/ B27/ EGF(20ng/ml)/ Pen-Strep) in nonadherent conditions, in culture dishes coated with
(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (poly-HEMA, Sigma,
#P3932). Cells were grown for 5 days and maintained
in a humidified incubator at 37°C at an atmospheric
pressure in 5% (v/v) carbon dioxide/air. After 5 days for
culture, spheres >50 μm were counted using an eye piece
graticule, and the percentage of cells plated which formed
spheres was calculated and is referred to as percentage
mammosphere formation, and was normalized to one (1
= 100 %MSE, mammosphere forming efficiency). For
pharmacological inhibition of mammosphere formation,
cells were directly seeded on low-attachment plates in the
presence of XCT790 or oligomycin or doxycycline at the
indicated concentrations.

Viability assay
Cell viability was assessed by sulphorhodamine
(SRB) assay, based on the measurement of cellular protein
content. After treatment with XCT790 for 3 or 5 days in
96 well plates, cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic
acid (TCA) for 1h in cold room, and dried overnight at
room temperature. Then, cells were incubated with SRB
for 15 min, washed twice with 1% acetic acid, and air
dried for at least 1h. Finally, the protein-bound dye was
dissolved in 10 mM Tris pH 8.8 solution and read using
the plate reader at 540 nm.

Pre-treatment of monolayers with XCT790
After incubation with XCT790 (5 or 10 μM for
48 hours), MCF7 cell monolayers were trypsinized and
seeded for mammosphere cultures for 5 days, without

Evaluation of CSC signalling pathways

30-60 min at 37 °C. All subsequent steps were performed
in the dark. Cells were washed in PBS, harvested, and resuspended in 300 μL of PBS. Cells were then analyzed
by flow cytometry. Data analysis was performed using
FlowJo software.

The Cignal Lenti reporter assay (luc) system
(Qiagen) was chosen for monitoring the activity of several
signaling pathways in MCF7 cells [25]. The responsive
luciferase constructs encode the firefly luciferase reporter
gene under the control of a minimal (m)CMV promoter
and tandem repeats of response elements for each pathway.
The following constructs were used: TCF/LEF(luc) for
Wnt signaling (CLS-018L); STAT3(luc) for transcriptional
activity of STAT3 (CLS-6028L); RBP-Jk(luc) for Notchinduced signaling (CLS-014L); ARE(luc) for Nrf2- and
Nrf1-mediated antioxidant response (CLS-2020L);
GAS(luc) for IFNγ-induced Stat1-signaling (CLS-009L);
ISRE(luc) for (IFN)-α/β-STAT1/2 signaling (CLS-008L);
SMAD(luc) for TGFβ-induced signaling (CLS-017L);
GLI(luc) for Sonic hedgehog signaling (CCS-6030L).
Briefly, 1 x 105 MCF7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates.
Once cells were attached, the viral particles were diluted
1:10 in complete culture media containing polybrene (sc134220, Santa Cruz), and added to the cells. Puromycin
treatment (#P9620, Sigma) was started 48 hours later in
order to select stably infected cells.

Seahorse XFe96 metabolic flux analysis
Extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) and realtime oxygen consumption rates (OCR) for MCF7 cells
treated with XCT790 or vehicle alone control were
determined using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XF96)
analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, MA, USA). MCF7 cells
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
(fetal bovine serum), 2 mM GlutaMAX, and 1% PenStrep. 7,000 cells were seeded per well into XF96-well
cell culture plates, and incubated overnight at 37°C in a
5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. After 24h, cells were
treated with XCT790 (5μM or 10 μM) for 48h. After
48h of treatment, cells were washed in pre-warmed XF
assay media (for OCR measurement, XF assay media
was supplemented with 10mM glucose, 1mM Pyruvate,
2mM L-glutamine and adjusted at pH 7.4). Cells were then
maintained in 175 µL/well of XF assay media at 37°C, in
a non-CO2 incubator for 1h. During the cell incubation
time, we loaded 25 µL each of 80mM glucose, 9µM
oligomycin, 1M 2-deoxyglucose (for ECAR measurement)
and 25 µL each of 10µM oligomycin, 9µM FCCP, 10µM
rotenone, 10µM antimycin A (for OCR measurement),
in XF assay media into the injection ports in the XFe-96
sensor cartridge. ECAR and OCR measurements were
normalized by protein content. Data set was analyzed by
XFe-96 software and GraphPad Prism software, using
one-way ANOVA and Student’s t-test calculations. All
experiments were performed in quintuplicate, three times
independently, such that each data point represents the
average of 15 replicates.

Luciferase assay
Luciferase Assay System (E1501, Promega) was
performed in all luciferase reporter MCF7 cells treated
with XCT790. Briefly, 6 × 103 MCF7 cells were seeded
in black-walled 96-well plates and then were treated with
XCT790 (10 μg/ml). As control, vehicle-treated cells
were run in parallel. Four replicates were used for each
condition. After 48 hours of treatment, luciferase assay was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Light signal was acquired for 2 minutes in photons/second
in the Xenogen VivoVision IVIS Lumina (Caliper Life
Sciences), and the results were analysed using the Living
Image 3.2 sofware (Caliper Life Sciences). Luminescence
was normalized using total proteins, as assessed with the
Bradford protein assay.

Label-free quantitative proteomics analysis
Cell lysates were prepared for trypsin digestion
by sequential reduction of disulphide bonds with TCEP
and alkylation with MMTS [47]. Then, the peptides were
extracted and prepared for LC-MS/MS. All LC-MS/MS
analyses were performed on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled to
an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific,
formerly Dionex, The Netherlands). Xcalibur raw data
files acquired on the LTQ-Orbitrap XL were directly
imported into Progenesis LCMS software (Waters Corp.,
Milford, MA, formerly Non-linear dynamics, Newcastle
upon Tyne, UK) for peak detection and alignment. Data
were analyzed using the Mascot search engine. Five
replicates were analyzed for each sample type (N = 5).
Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA and

Mitochondrial staining
To measure mitochondrial activity, cells were
stained with MitoTracker Orange (#M7510, Invitrogen),
whose accumulation in mitochondria is dependent upon
membrane potential. To measure mitochondrial mass,
cells were stained with MitoTracker Green (#M7514
Invitrogen), or MitoTracker Deep Red (#M22426,
Invitrogen), both localizing to mitochondria regardless of
mitochondrial membrane potential. Briefly, MCF7 cells
were treated with XCT790 for 48 hours. Cells were then
incubated with pre-warmed MitoTracker staining solution
(diluted in PBS/CM to a final concentration of 10 nM) for
