Abstract
Radiotherapy is widely used as a radical treatment for prostate cancer, but curative treatments are elusive
for poorly differentiated tumors where survival is just 15% at 15 years. Dose escalation improves local response
rates but is limited by tolerance in normal tissues. A sphingosine analogue, FTY720 (fingolimod), a drug currently in phase III studies for treatment of multiple sclerosis, has been found to be a potent apoptosis inducer
in prostate cancer cells. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we analyzed the impact of FTY720 on sphingolipid metabolism in hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer cells and evaluated its potential as a radiosensitizer on cell lines and prostate tumor xenografts. In prostate cancer cell lines, FTY720 acted as a
sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) inhibitor that induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis in a manner independent
of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. In contrast, γ irradiation did not affect SphK1 activity in prostate
cancer cells yet synergized with FTY720 to inhibit SphK1. In mice bearing orthotopic or s.c. prostate cancer
tumors, we show that FTY720 dramatically increased radiotherapeutic sensitivity, reducing tumor growth and
metastasis without toxic side effects. Our findings suggest that low, well-tolerated doses of FTY720 could offer
significant improvement to the clinical treatment of prostate cancer. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8651–61. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
In the western world prostate cancer is now the most
commonly diagnosed noncutaneous cancer in men and is
the second leading cause of cancer-related death (1). In the
United States the lifetime probability of developing prostate
cancer is 1 in 6, and it is estimated that 192,280 new cases of
prostate cancer were diagnosed during 2009, and there were
27,360 deaths.
The management of prostate cancer is complex, but for
the majority of patients radiotherapy remains a definitive
treatment for early-stage disease. However, up to 85% of patients with poor histologic subtypes of localized prostate
cancer relapse (2). In radiotherapy research the current
emphasis is on computerized planning to deliver increased
dosage schedules. There is an opportunity to approach the

subject of dose intensification from a different angle, and this
is through the use of radiosensitizer treatment.
Prostate cancer cell radioresistance has been linked with
sustained activation of sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1; ref. 3).
SphK1 is a lipid converting enzyme responsible for the conversion of sphingosine into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P).
S1P, and sphingosine and its precursor ceramide are lipid
second messengers. In response to various stimuli ceramide
and sphingosine mediate cell death, whereas S1P abrogates
apoptosis and mediates cell proliferation and migration (4).
The SphK1/S1P pathway contributes to cancer progression
and leads to increased cell proliferation (5), impairment of
apoptosis (6), and oncogenic transformation (7). SphK1 is a
tumor-associated enzyme: high levels of SphK1 expression
have been shown in various human tumor tissues (8, 9). Furthermore high levels of SphK1 expression and activity are associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer (10), glioma
(11), and gastric cancer (12).
These findings have highlighted the potential of SphK1 as
a therapy target. A sphingosine analogue, dimethylsphingosine, was the first reported SphK inhibitor to induce prostate
cancer cell apoptosis (3). These findings were further confirmed by ourselves (13), showing a new selective SphK inhibitor, SKI-II (first reported by French et al.; ref. 9), to have
proapoptotic properties in prostate cancer cells. Work from
our group in prostate cancer indicates that inhibition of the
SphK1/S1P pathway has a synergistic effect with chemotherapy and has the potential to act as a molecular target for cancer therapy (14–16).

of lymphocytes' egress from lymphoid organs through its antagonist function on the lymphocytes' S1P receptors (17, 18).
Recently the results of phase III trials have become available,
showing significant potential of oral FTY720 (fingolimod) in
multiple sclerosis patients (19, 20).
Surprisingly, at higher doses FTY720 has been shown to be
a potent apoptosis inducer in prostate, liver ,and bladder
cancer cell lines (21–23). In a mouse model of melanoma
FTY720 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis (24) without
causing detectable toxicity in vital organs. Direct mitochondria damage (25), activation of caspases (21), and dephosphorylation of Akt (26) have all been proposed as potential
mechanisms for FTY720-induced apoptosis. The effects of
FTY720 were reported be both S1P receptor dependent (24)
and independent (27). In prostate cancer cells FTY720 has
been shown to be a potent apoptosis inducer (21), whereas
normal prostate cells exhibited resistance to the drug.
FTY720 has been shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell invasion via downregulation of GTP-bound active form of RhoA
(28), and administration of FTY720 at 10 mg/kg/day reduced
the growth of prostate CWR22R xenografts in castrated nude
mice (29).
In this current study we identified a novel mechanism of
FTY720-induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis. Here we
report that FTY720 can act as a SphK1 inhibitor in vitro
and in vivo and that SphK1 inhibition is critical for
FTY720-induced apoptosis. Sublethal concentrations of
FTY720 act as a radiosensitizer in cell lines and in implanted
tumors, reducing tumor metastasis.
Our preliminary data point to the need for clinical testing
to establish whether FTY720 therapy might provide an
advantage in terms of increased local tumor control to
patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy.

nuclei were measured as previously described using the
MTT assay (13), Annexin V–FITC/propidium iodide (PI)
staining, and Syto13/PI staining (14).
Sphingosine kinase-1 assay and mass measurements of
ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and sphingosine
Sphingosine kinase-1 assay and mass measurements of
ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and sphingosine were
performed as described previously (14, 32).
Real-time qRT-PCR
Real-time qRT-PCR was performed as described previously (16).
Caspase-3/7 activity
Caspase-3/7 activity was measured as previously described (14).
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (16).
Animal study
Animal study was performed as previously described (13).
Briefly, intraprostatic and s.c. human prostate cancer xenografts were established in NMRI/Nu (nu/nu) 7-week-old male
mice by surgical orthotopic implantation or s.c. injection of 1 ×
106 PC-3/GFP cells. Three weeks after implantation, mice were
randomized into different groups and treated for two weeks
with i.p. injections of PBS (control), 2.5 mg/kg/day FTY720,
5 sessions of γ-irradiation (4 Gy) every 3rd day, or γ-irradiation
combined with FTY720. Two days after the last treatment, all
mice were euthanized with carbon dioxide asphyxiation for
direct internal imaging. Tumor area (a) and the small diameter
(d) were used to assess tumor volume (v) using the formula
v = a × d × 2/3. Primary tumors were then removed, saved,
and routinely processed for H&E histology to confirm the nature of the disease or were processed for sphingolipid analyses.
Blood counts were determined as previously described (33).
Data representation and statistical analysis
The statistical significance of differences between the
means of two groups was evaluated by unpaired two-sided
Student's t test, and the overall significance of multiple groups
was evaluated by ANOVA. Calculations were performed using
Graphpad Prism Software. Representative images are presented for the experiments carried out with fluorescence.

FTY720 Radiosensitizes Prostate Cancer

Results
Sphingosine analogue FTY720 induces apoptosis in
prostate cancer cells by inhibition of SphK1
FTY720 induces dose-dependent loss of cell viability in metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cells (Fig. 1A), achieving an IC50
at ∼30 hours of exposure at 5 μmol/L dose. This loss of cell
viability was preceded by an activation of caspase 3 and/or
7 (∼2.5 fold at 6 hours; Fig. 1B) and was followed by an
increase in apoptotic cells (51 ± 5% at 48 hours; Fig. 1C). A
similar decrease in cell viability (Fig. 1D) and an increase in
apoptosis and caspase-3 activation (not shown) were observed in DU145 metastatic prostate cancer cells, in agreement with previous reports (21, 34).
FTY720 is a sphingosine analogue and was previously
shown to inhibit enzymatic activity of recombinant SphK1
(35). Here we report that FTY720 induced a rapid inhibition
of SphK1 enzymatic activity in PC-3 and DU145 cells (-28 ±
5% and -40 ± 5% in PC-3 and DU145 cells, respectively, at
6 hours; Fig. 2). This inhibition was followed by a decrease
in intracellular S1P (-18 ± 6% and -31 ± 5% in PC-3 and
DU145 cells, respectively, at 6 hours) and a more delayed
increase in intracellular ceramide (51 ± 10% and 58 ± 5% in
PC-3 and DU145 cells, respectively, at 24 hours). Of note,
qRT-PCR analysis showed that treatment with FTY720 did
not induce significant changes in the expression of the SphK1
gene during first 24 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Overexpression of SphK1 in PC-3 cells rendered them less
sensitive to FTY720 (65 ± 8% versus 35 ± 6% of loss of cell

viability in PC-3/NEO versus PC-3/SphK1 cells, respectively;
Fig. 2C). Conversely, the silencing S1P1 to S1P5 receptors
either individually or altogether did not alter FTY720induced PC-3 cell death (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting
a receptor-independent mode of action. Treatment with
FTY720 also decreased the levels of intracellular phosphoAkt, which, however, was downstream of FTY720-induced
SphK1 downregulation because SphK1 overexpression
restored the levels of phospho-Akt in FTY720-treated cells
and the SphK inhibitor SKI-II could per se reduce the levels
of phospho-Akt (Supplementary Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. 2,
FTY720 treatment induced only a late modest increase in
intracellular ceramide. Pretreatment of PC-3 cells with
fumonisin B1 (inhibitor of de novo ceramide synthesis),
GW4869 (neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor), or imipramine (acid sphingomyelinase inhibitor) could not abrogate
FTY720-induced apoptosis, suggesting that ceramide accumulation was a consequence of SphK1 inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S4).
γ-Irradiation induces prostate cancer cell death
independently of SphK1
When treated with a single dose of γ-irradiation both PC-3
and DU145 cells were sensitive to 10 Gy treatment, achieving a
40% loss of cell viability at ∼72 hours and 48 hours for PC-3
and DU145 cells, respectively (Fig. 3A). In both cell lines a
further increase in γ-irradiation dose to 20 Gy did not lead
to a significant increase in cell death (data not shown). On
the contrary, both cell lines exhibited a partial resistance when

120-hour treatment with 5 Gy in both cell lines; Fig. 3A).
In contrast to FTY720, treatment of prostate cancer cells
with γ-irradiation did not result in SphK1 inhibition. Conversely in DU145 cells, γ-irradiation induced rather an upregulation of SphK1 activity (43 ± 7% and 45 ± 6% by 5 Gy and
10 Gy, respectively, P < 0.05; Fig. 3B), which, however, was not
mediated by SphK1 transcription (Fig. 3C).

SphK1 inhibition by FTY720 sensitizes prostate cancer
cells to γ-irradiation
In line with previous reports showing that SphK1 inhibition
by dimethylsphingosine or SKI-II could respectively sensitize
prostate cancer cell models to γ-irradiation (3) and chemotherapy (17, 18), here we report that 1 to 5 μmol/L FTY720
successfully sensitized PC-3 and DU145 cells to γ-irradiation
(Fig. 4A and B). Fluorescent activated cell sorter analysis

FTY720 Radiosensitizes Prostate Cancer

(Fig. 4C) and fluorescent microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S5)
revealed that this radiosensitization was mediated by an
induction of apoptosis. Isobologram analysis revealed that in
both cell lines FTY720 and γ-irradiation act in synergy (Supplementary Fig. S6). Similarly to FTY720, the SphK inhibitor
SKI-II (Fig. 4D) and SphK1 siRNA, but not SphK2 siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S7), sensitized PC-3 and DU145 (not shown)
prostate cancer cells to γ-irradiation.
Figure 5 shows that the addition of FTY720 to PC-3 cells
subjected to γ-irradiation significantly exacerbated the inhibition of SphK1 activity (-46.0 ± 5.7% versus 0.2 ± 6.5%, P =
0.0178), comparable with the levels in cells treated with
FTY720 alone (-27.5 ± 3.1%; Fig. 5A). Similarly, the addition
of FTY720 decreased the levels of intracellular S1P in irradiated PC-3 cells (Fig. 5A). There was no significant difference
between the levels of intracellular ceramide in cells subjected
to treatments alone or in combination (Fig. 5A).
In DU145, γ-irradiation induced an increase in both SphK1
activity and intracellular S1P (43.0 ± 6.1% and 36.3 ± 3.6%,
respectively), which was completely reversed by the addition
of FTY720 (-16.6 ± 4.8% and -19.7 ± 8.2%; Fig. 5B). In contrast
to PC-3 cells, combination of FTY720 and γ-irradiation
slightly increased intracellular ceramide (Fig. 5B).

Our data show that in contrast to a modest increase in
ceramide, 6 hours of treatment with FTY720 induced a significant, transient increase in intracellular sphingosine (Supplementary Fig. S8A). Furthermore, although γ-irradiation
did not influence sphingosine production, it acted in synergy
with FTY720 (Supplementary Fig. S8A). We then verified the
potential of proapoptotic sphingolipids as radiosensitizers.
Supplementary Figure S8B shows that both sphingosine
and to a smaller extent ceramide could sensitize PC-3 cells
to γ-irradiation. Although extracellular ceramide acted as a
radiosensitizer (Supplementary Fig. S8B), blocking the generation of intracellular ceramide had no effect on PC-3 cell
survival (Supplementary Fig. S9).
Similarly to blocking PC-3 cell apoptosis induced by FTY720
alone (Fig. 2), SphK1 overexpression abrogated FTY720induced radiosensitization (Supplementary Fig. S10A). This
correlated with a significant decrease in SphK1 inhibition
induced by FTY720 in PC-3 cells overexpressing SPhK1 (Supplementary Fig. S10B). Similarly to SphK1 overexpression,
the addition of extracellular S1P partially blocked PC-3 cell
death after treatment with either FTY720 or FTY720 together
with γ-irradiation (Supplementary Fig. S11). Although FTY720
alone induced a rapid increase in caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 1B),

combined treatment with FTY720 and γ-irradiation did not
result in a further activation of executioner caspases (Supplementary Fig. S12A). Moreover, addition of a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-vad.fmk, did not result in a significant protection
from FTY720- or combination treatment-induced cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S12B). Finally, to verify the universality
of FTY720-induced radiosensitization, we treated androgensensitive metastatic LNCaP-C4-2B, PC-3M, and nonmetastatic
22Rv1 prostate cancer cells with FTY720 with or without
γ-irradiation (Supplementary Fig. S13). Our data show that
FTY720 acted as a radiosensitizer in all three cell lines.
FTY720 radiosensitizes human fluorescent PC-3 tumors
established in nude mice
Subcutaneous and orthotopic PC-3 tumors were inoculated in nude mice and grown for three weeks. These animals were then treated for two weeks with i.p. injections
of PBS (control), 2.5 mg/kg/day FTY720, 5 sessions of
γ-irradiation (4 Gy) every 3rd day, or γ-irradiation combined with FTY720.
After 5 weeks s.c. tumors in nontreated animals reached
2,190 ± 388 mm3, whereas in animals treated with FTY720
alone their volume was 1,355 ± 149 mm 3 (P = 0.0043).
γ-Irradiation alone diminished the tumor volume to 870 ±
30 mm 3 (P < 0.0001 versus control; P = 0.0007 versus
FTY720), whereas combined treatment led to the most signif-

icant reduction in tumor volume at 390 ± 70 mm3 (P < 0.0001
versus γ-irradiation; ANOVA; P < 0.0001; Fig. 6A).
Orthotopic PC-3 tumors showed a similar response to
the treatments: 469 ± 41 mg, 281 ± 26 mg, 185 ± 13 mg,
and 34 ± 12 mg in mice treated with control, FTY720,
γ-irradiation, or combined treatment respectively (P <
0.0001, ANOVA; P < 0.0001, t-test γ-irradiation versus combined treatment; Fig. 6B).
Figure 6C shows that although γ-irradiation alone did not
significantly affect the levels of tumor SphK1 activity (100 ±
5.0 versus 89.5 ± 7.9, not significant; in animals receiving control or γ-irradiation, respectively), treatment with FTY720 or
a combination of FTY720 with γ-irradiation significantly reduced SphK1 activity (76.3 ± 6.6 versus 56.2 ± 9.4 in animals
treated with FTY720 or a combination of FTY720 with
γ-irradiation, respectively). Levels of tumor S1P were lower
in animals treated with combination therapy than in animals
receiving γ-irradiation alone. The difference between intracellular ceramide levels in all four groups did not reach
significance (Fig. 6C).
The effect of combination therapy on primary tumor
growth was paralleled by a significant reduction of distant
metastasis (adrenal, liver, and lungs, excluding aortic lymph
nodes as being a primary site for prostate cancer metastasis;
positive in all animals) with 63% (5 of 8) of animals free of
distant metastases (compared with 100% in both untreated

and FTY-treated groups, and 25% in irradiated animals, with
2 of 8 metastases-free; Fig. 6D).
Fluorescent imaging revealed that FTY720 alone did not affect the number of secondary tumors (3.33 ± 0.44 versus 3.14 ±
0.54 metastases/mouse in control and FTY720 groups, respectively, P not significant), whereas γ-irradiation significantly
reduced the number of distant metastases (1.43 ± 0.29 metastases/mouse). Combination treatment further reduced the
number of distant tumors (0.55 ± 0.23 metastases/mouse,
P = 0.0366 in comparison with γ-irradiation alone; Fig. 6D).
FTY720 and γ-irradiation reduce WBC counts in
nude mice
In nude mice a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of FTY720 induced a
rapid reduction of leukocyte blood counts which within 3 days
normalized to control levels (Supplementary Fig. S14A). To
identify the impact of prolonged FTY720 treatment on blood
cell counts, blood was analyzed at the time of sacrifice (two
days after the last treatment with FTY720). Mice treated with
FTY720 alone had a moderate ∼30% reduction in total circulating leukocytes and lymphocytes, and no changes were
observed in peripheral macrophages and granulocytes
(Supplementary Fig. S14B), as reported previously (36, 37).

Discussion
In this current study we provide compelling evidence that
FTY720 is a SphK1 inhibitor and a potent radiosensitizer of
human prostate cancer both in vitro and in vivo.
Several lines of evidence suggest that FTY720 has an antiproliferative potential in prostate cancer cells. FTY720 was
previously reported to induce apoptosis in DU145 cells
(21, 34). Here we show for the first time that FTY720 is a
strong inducer of apoptosis in hormone-refractory, metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cells. FTY720-induced apoptosis
in PC-3 cells was dose dependent and was preceded by
significant upregulation of caspase 3 and 7 activity (Fig. 1).
FTY720 has been previously reported to inhibit SphK1
in situ (35). In our study we show for the first time that
FTY720 has a capacity to inhibit SphK1 enzymatic activity
in vitro (Fig. 2) and that this inhibition is not related to a
reduction in SphK1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
SphK1 inhibition seems to be a crucial step in FTY720induced prostate cancer apoptosis, because SphK1 overexpression exerts a cytoprotective effect (Fig. 2). This
cytoprotection is partial, however, which indicates the
existence of parallel, SphK1-independent mechanisms of

FTY720 Radiosensitizes Prostate Cancer

Akt phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S3). This effect
was SphK1 dependent, however, because it could be mimicked by SphK1 inhibition and restored by SphK1 overexpression. Finally, our data show that FTY720-mediated
ceramide accumulation was not responsible for FTY720induced apoptosis because pretreatment of prostate cancer
cells with inhibitors of sphingomyelinases and de novo ceramide synthesis pathway did not abrogate FTY720-induced
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S4). Overall our data suggest
a SphK1-mediated S1PR-independent mechanism of prostate cancer cell apoptosis induced by FTY720.
Sphingolipids have previously been shown to play a role
in prostate cancer radioresistance. Radioresistant prostate
cancer cell lines are deficient in the generation of proapoptotic ceramide and sphingosine, and the addition or
increased production of these lipids is radiosensitizing (3,
38, 39). In contrast to completely radioresistant, androgensensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells, both DU145 and
PC-3 hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer cells respond to γ-irradiation in a dose-dependent manner. With
this in mind, one of the major aims of our study was to
investigate possible therapeutic dose intensification. In
contrast to several DNA-damaging therapies that were previously shown to downregulate SphK1 activity (13, 40, 41),
here we report that in both PC-3 and DU145 metastatic
prostate cancer cell lines γ-irradiation–induced apoptosis
was not associated with SphK1 inhibition (Fig. 3) or an
increase in intracellular ceramide (Fig. 5). Interestingly in
DU145 cells, irradiation even induced a slight activation
of SphK1 (but not through transcription), an effect observed in several cancer cell lines treated with DNAdamaging agents (13, 42). We therefore conclude that in
metastatic prostate cancer cells γ-irradiation does not regulate the SphK1/S1P pathway, which suggests that its external manipulation may provide benefit in terms of dose
intensification.
We have shown that SK1 inhibition leads to a promotion of the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy on cell lines
(13, 14, 16). Although metastatic prostate cancer cells are
partially responsive to γ-irradiation, sustained SphK1 activity may provide an “escape from apoptosis” for these
cells. We hypothesized that SphK1 inhibition may, in addition to its effects on chemotherapy, serve as potential
radiosensitizer. Here we show for the first time that
FTY720 can sensitize PC-3, DU145, LNCaP-C4-2B, PC-3M,
and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells to irradiation by apoptosis
induction in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4, and Supplementary Figs. S5, S6, and S13). Our data suggest that
FTY720-mediated radiosensitization is mediated by SphK1
inhibition (Fig. 5) and is similar to the effects that can be
achieved by the SphK inhibitor SKI-II or SphK1 siRNA
(Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S7). Conversely, the radiosensitization can be blocked by SphK1 overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S10) or extracellular S1P (Supplementary
Fig. S11). Interestingly, although FTY720 induced only a
small increase in ceramide (Fig. 5), it induced a significant
transient increase in intracellular sphingosine (Supplementary Fig. S8A) acting in synergy with γ-irradiation. As

www.aacrjournals.org

previously reported (3), both sphingosine and ceramide
can act as radiosensitizers (Supplementary Fig. S8B), but
blocking the generation of intracellular ceramide has
no effect on PC-3 cell survival (Supplementary Fig. S9),
confirming that its low intracellular levels are not sufficient to induce prostate cancer cell death. Our data show
that FTY720-induced radiosensitization is caspase independent (Supplementary Fig. S12), suggesting that the depletion of prosurvival signaling (e.g., Akt, SphK1/S1P) may
be the major mechanism of FTY720-induced apoptosis/
radiosensitization.
This implies that although γ-irradiation can induce
prostate cancer cell death, its effect can be potentiated
by the downregulation of SphK1 activity. These data correlate with our previous findings on SphK1 downregulation
potentiating the effects of docetaxel chemotherapy in prostate cancer (14, 16). These results are also in line with our
previous findings in which SphK1 inhibition by dimethylsphingosine was shown to sensitize completely radioresistant androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells to
γ-irradiation (3).
The efficacy of FTY720 in animal cancer models including
prostate cancer was shown previously (29, 43). Here we show
for the first time that FTY720 can radiosensitize hormonerefractory metastatic human prostate cancer tumors established in nude mice. Our in vivo data show that treatment
with FTY720 alone decreased the size of both s.c. and orthotopic tumors (Fig. 6). Furthermore, cotreatment with FTY720
resulted in a further reduction in both orthotopic and s.c. tumors treated with γ-irradiation. In our models the efficacy of
FTY720 was correlated to a decrease in tumor SphK1 activity
and S1P levels (Fig. 6C).
At the selected dose (2.5 mg/kg/day), treatment with
FTY720 alone had only a moderate effect on primary tumor
growth (Fig. 6). In contrast to previous data showing the
ability of FTY720 to block cell invasion in prostate cancer
three-dimensional cell cultures (28), in our model treatment
with FTY720 alone did not influence the number of distant
metastases. Surprisingly γ-irradiation alone led to a significant reduction in the number of distant metastases, which
was further enhanced by cotreatment with FTY720, suggesting a synergetic mechanism of action between FTY720 and
γ-irradiation.
In accordance with previous studies, prolonged treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day FTY720 led to a moderate lymphopenia (Supplementary Fig. S14B). The major reported
complication of FTY720 is a transient decrease in the
heart rate due to a “first dose” effect, and no toxic effects
had been observed in healthy volunteers treated for 7
consecutive days with 5 mg/day FTY720 (44, 45). At the
used dose (2.5 mg/kg/day) we did not observe any toxicity or gross abnormalities (like weight loss or i.p. inflammation) in animals treated with FTY720. It is worth
noting that until recently no clinically tested SphK1 inhibitors were available. Conversely, recent data from phase
III trials show clinical safety and significant potential of
oral FTY720 (fingolimod) in multiple sclerosis patients
(19, 20).

In conclusion, here we show for the first time that
FTY720 induces prostate cancer apoptosis and radiosensitization through SphK1 inhibition. Our data draw attention
to the potential of FTY720 as an adjuvant treatment for
local tumor control in prostate cancer patients treated with
radical radiotherapy.
