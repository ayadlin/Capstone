ABSTRACT
Here we showed that Osthole, 7-methoxy-8-(3-methyl-2-butenyl) coumarin, a
bioactive coumarin derivative extracted from medicinal plants, inhibited migration,
invasion, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in androgen-independent
prostate cancer (AIPC) cells in vitro and metastasis of AIPC in vivo. In patients,
high Snail levels were correlated with a higher histological Gleason sum and poor
survival rates. Osthole inhibited the TGF-β/Akt/MAPK pathways, reduced Snail-DNAbinding activity and induced E-cadherin. We found that osthole decreased miR-23a-3p.
Ectopic miR-23a-3p suppressed E-cadherin 3’ untranslated region reporter activity
and E-cadherin expression, and relieved the motility suppression caused by osthole
treatment.

INTRODUCTION

inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and tasquinimod, possess
chemopreventive effects [5-8].
The majority of deaths associated with prostate
cancer are attributed to a failure to cure metastatic disease
[9]. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one
of events in cancer metastasis and often occurs at the
invasive front of tumors [10]. During EMT, cells lose their
epithelial traits and acquire mesenchymal characteristics,
such as downregulating E-cadherin (E-cad) and β-catenin,
and upregulating N-cadherin (N-cad) and fibronectin,
resulting in a weakened adhesion ability and enhanced
motility [11]. EMT confers chemoresistance in several
cancer types [12]. Growth factors, such as transforming
growth factor (TGF)-β and epidermal growth factor (EGF),
induce EMT by modulating these epithelial (E-cad) and
mesenchymal markers (N-cad) [13]. Several transcription
factors, including Snail, a zinc finger transcription factor,
control EMT [14]. Snail binds to the promoter of the
E-cad gene and represses its transcription, which is one

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths among males in the USA [1,2].
Currently, androgen-depletion therapy (ADT) is the
predominant treatment, which is effective for androgendependent prostate cancer (ADPC). However, prostate
cancer usually progresses from an androgen-dependent
to an androgen-independent stage, making anti-androgen
therapy ineffective and leading to an increase in the
metastatic potential and an incurable malignancy, the
so called androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC)
or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) [3].
Chemotherapy has not shown satisfactory results for
prostate cancer. For example, patients with metastatic
AIPC treated with docetaxel can only maintain
progression-free survival for less than 6 months [4]. Some
natural compounds, such as psoralidin and FTY720,
or chemical compounds, such as non-steroidal antiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the hallmark events in EMT and metastasis [15-17].
Ectopic expression of Snail triggers the EMT, enhances
cancer cell motility, and confers resistance to senescence
of cancer cells [18], which provides a selective advantage
for tumors that become malignant.
Micro (mi)RNAs are single-stranded, noncoding
endogenous RNAs, of approximately 18~24 nucleotides
long, which post-transcriptionally modulate gene
expression by either inhibiting translation or inducing
messenger (m)RNA degradation. miRNAs function as
oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes through respectively
binding to 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of target tumor
suppressor genes or oncogenes [19, 20]. In particular,
miRNAs are involved in EMT [21, 22]. Array-based
miRNA profiling of human cancer cells identified an
association between miRNA deregulation and cancer
metastasis [23-25].
Osthole,
7-methoxy-8-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)
coumarin, a simple bioactive coumarin derivative
extracted from medicinal plants such as Cnidium
monnieri (L.) Cusson, inhibits growth and metastasis in
various cancer types [26-28]. Coumarin was also used in
a clinical trial to prevent disease recurrence in melanoma
patients [29]. However, compared to other tumor types,
data regarding the antitumor effects of osthole on AIPC
are largely unknown. Thus, in the present study, we
investigated the effects of osthole on the motility of
AIPC cells and elucidated possible underlying molecular
mechanisms. We showed that osthole suppresses the
EMT-mediated metastatic potential of human AIPC
through transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the
EMT-related molecule, E-cad, by respectively inhibiting
the TGF-β/Akt/MAPK/Snail signal cascade and
downregulating miR-23a-3p.

invasion assays. Results from the MTS assay showed
that even at the highest concentration of 80 μM, osthole
only partially altered or did not alter the viability of these
AIPC cell lines with 24-h treatment, compared to that
of the controls (Figure 1D). We further investigated the
effects of osthole on cell cycle regulation. Results showed
that treatment of DU145 cells with osthole (60 μM) for
24 h did not increase the incidence of apoptosis. The lack
of significant changes in the sub G1 population between
control and osthole-treated DU145 cells provides evidence
for this (Figure 1E). The DU145 cell proliferation rate
was also not affected by osthole, because the number of
cells in the S-phase did not significantly change after 24
h of osthole treatment (Figure 1E). According to these
data, osthole significantly inhibited cancer cell invasion
at a non- or low-cytotoxic concentration, indicating that
osthole is an effective inhibitor of the motility of AIPC
cells.

Significant antimetastatic and antiproliferative
effects of osthole in a PC3 orthotopic graft model
Although the antitumor effect of osthole was
demonstrated in various cancer types in vitro [26,28],
studies on its antitumor effects in vivo are rare. Here,
luciferase-expressing PC3M-Luc cells were established
and injected into the capsule of the anterior prostate of
SCID mice and allowed to become established for 8 days
before initiating treatment. PC3M-Luc orthotopic graft
mice were treated with different dosages of osthole or
the vehicle control every other day by IP administration,
and tumor growth and metastasis were monitored by
bioluminescence imaging. Figure 2A shows the inhibitory
potency of osthole on tumor growth after 21 days of
treatment by photon emission detection in vivo. In ostholetreated mice receiving 100 mg/kg, the mean tumor volume
on day 21 was significantly inhibited compared to vehicletreated PC3M tumors (Figure 2A). Mice were sacrificed
at the end of the experiment (29 days after cell injection),
and the mean tumor weight was lower in 30- and 100-mg/
kg osthole-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice
(Figure 2B). To examine whether osthole exerts antitumor
activity in vivo via inhibiting proliferation, proliferating
cells were indicated by immunocytochemical staining
of the proliferation marker, Ki67. After treatment with
osthole, numbers of Ki67-positive cells were reduced
compared to control mice (Figure 2C). In addition to tumor
growth inhibition, formation of spontaneous metastasis
was dramatically prevented dose-dependently by osthole
according to evidence from ex vivo photon imaging which
indicated that the organs around the prostate showed a
lower intensity in 30- and 100-mg/kg osthole-treated mice
compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure 2D). In addition,
H&E staining revealed that the incidence of distal liver
tumor metastasis in vehicle-treated mice was higher than

RESULTS
Suppression of migration and invasion of human
AIPC cells by osthole treatment
The chemical structure of osthole is shown in Figure
1A. To study the effect of osthole on prostate cancer
cell migration and invasion abilities, we respectively
performed wound-closure and Matrigel invasion assays
on two metastatic AIPC cell lines, DU145 and PC3. After
treating DU145 or PC3 cells with various concentrations of
osthole for 24 h, results showed that osthole concentrationdependently suppressed the wound-closure and invasive
abilities at concentrations of 20~80 μM (Figure 1B,
1C). To exclude the possibility that decreased numbers
of migrating and invading cells were a consequence of
reduced proliferation, we performed viability assays
using DU145 and PC3 cells treated with the same osthole
concentration that was used in the wound-closure and

that in 100-mg/kg osthole-treated mice (Figure 2E). These
observations suggest that osthole was an effective agent
that inhibited the growth and metastasis of transplanted
prostate gland tumors in vivo.

Osthole suppresses

Snail-mediated

(ECM) play crucial roles during the development and
metastasis of AIPC [30,31]. Effects of osthole on the EMT
and ECM degradation of AIPC cells were examined by
treating DU145 cells with various concentration of osthole
for 24 h and observing EMT- and ECM degradationrelated proteins. Western blotting (Figure 3A, 3B) and
immunofluorescent staining (Figure 3C) results showed
that treatment with osthole increased expressions of the
epithelial markers, E-cad and β-catenin, and decreased
expression of the mesenchymal marker, N-cad, in
DU145 cells, but had no effect on the activities of

of osthole on MMP-2/9 activation and similar effect of

observed in PC3 cells (Supplementary Figure S1B and

transcriptional factors (Snail, Slug, and Twist) which
are recognized as transcriptional repressors of E-cad
[32]. Treatment with osthole significantly decreased
the expression of Snail in DU145 cells, but had less or
undetectable effects on the other transcriptional factors,
Twist and Slug, respectively (Figure 3D). Moreover,
a ChIP assay was performed to investigate the effect of
osthole on the binding of Snail to the E-cad promoter.
As illustrated in the upper panel of Figure 3E, binding
of Snail to the E-cad promoter decreased in DU145 cells
after osthole treatment. This result was further confirmed
by a quantitative real-time PCR assay; osthole indeed
significantly suppressed binding of Snail to the E-cad
promoter (Figure 3E, lower panel). We further detected
Snail protein levels of PC3M xenografts harvested from
vehicle- or osthole-treated mice and found that levels
of Snail had also decreased in tumors isolated from
osthole-treated mice (Figure 3F). These data suggest that
downregulating Snail is important for the osthole-induced
suppression of the EMT in AIPC cells and an AIPC
xenograft model.

repression of Snail and cell motility in AIPC. As shown
in the lower panel of Figure 4D, overexpressing activated
Akt in Du145 cells partially increased the ability of cells to
invade. Overexpressing activated Akt significantly rescued
the osthole-mediated suppression of Snail expression
(Figure 4D, upper panel) and the cell-invasive ability
(Figure 4D, lower panel). Moreover, suppressive effects
of osthole on activation of Akt, JNK, and ERK were
also observed in osthole-treated PC3 grafts (Figure 4E).
Taken together, these results suggest that osthole mediated
downregulation of E-cad’s transcriptional repressor, Snail,
and cell-invasive ability by suppressing the TGF-β/Akt/
MAPK signaling cascade in AIPC cells.

Biological significance of Snail in prostate cancer
progression
In addition to defining the role of Snail in ostholemediated suppression of cell motility in vitro and in vivo,
we further determined the prognostic significance of Snail
in 110 human prostate cancer specimens that had clinical
follow-up records. The clinicopathological features of
these 110 patients are shown in Table 1. Representative
examples with different Snail scores are shown in Figure
5A. Relationships between Snail expression levels and
clinicopathological characteristics of prostate cancer are
summarized in Table 2. Among these specimens, high
Snail expression levels (with a score of ≥ 8) were strongly
correlated with a higher histological Gleason score and a
higher preoperative PSA value compared to tumors with
low-Snail expression levels (with a score of ≤ 6). With the
Kaplan-Meier log rank test, we observed that patients with
high Snail expression and a high Gleason score sum (of ≥
7) had reduced overall survival times (Figure 5B, 5C). Our
data indicated that higher levels of Snail predicted a poor
prognosis in prostate cancer.

The TGF-β/Akt/MAPK signaling cascade
is involved in osthole’s suppression of Snail
expression
TGF-β is a potent EMT inducer via the PI3K/
Akt pathway during tumor progression [33]. Activation
of PI3K/Akt was reported to play an important role in
prostate tumorigenesis and its progression to castration
resistance, indicating that an Akt-elated pathway may
play an important role in AIPC. Higher levels of p-MAPK
were observed in malignant and AIPC prostate tissues
than in non-malignant specimens [30]. We therefore
examined whether TGF-β production and the Akt and
MAPK pathways were involved in osthole-mediated
suppression of Snail and cell invasion in AIPC cells. Our
results showed that treatment of Du145 cells with osthole
for different time points (4~12 h) suppressed expression
of TGF-β at an earlier phase (4 h after treatment) and
activation of Akt, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2 at a later phase
(8 h after treatment) (Figure 4A). Moreover, pretreatment
of Du145 cells with the PI3K/Akt inhibitor, Ly294002,
enhanced the inhibitory effect of osthole against JNK1/2
and ERK1/2 activities, indicating that the JNK and ERK
pathways are downstream signals of Akt (Figure 4B).
Next, we further investigated relationships among ostholemediated inhibitory effects on Akt/MAPK activation,
Snail expression, and the cell-invasive ability. Treatment
of Du145 cells with a MEK/ERK inhibitor (PD 98059),
a JNK inhibitor (SP 600125), or Ly294002 significantly
inhibited Snail expression (Figure 4C). The constitutively
activated Akt, myr-Akt, was ectopically expressed in
Du145 cells (Figure 4D, upper panel) to further investigate
whether Akt plays an important role in osthole-mediated

miRNA was reported to be an important regulator
of cancer progression and metastasis [34]. In addition to
determining the Snail-mediated transcriptional regulation
of E-cad by osthole, we next investigated whether miRNA
participates in osthole-mediated upregulation of E-cad
and inhibition of cell motility. To identify which miRNAs
are regulated by osthole, a high-throughput and specific
miRNA microarray (human miRNA OneArray® miRNA
profiling chip) using Du145 cells after osthole treatment
was conducted by the Phalanx Biotech Group (Hsinchu,
Taiwan). Expressions of miRNAs downregulated by
osthole (60 µM) treatment were shown in a heat map, and
the top 10 downregulated miRNAs were further analyzed
by the miRNA target database, miRanda, to determine

which miRNA might target E-cad (Figure 6A). We
found that miR-146a, -22-3p, and -23a-3p were miRNAs
downregulated in response to osthole treatment and might
target E-cad. To further confirm the expressions of these
three miRNAs, we performed a TaqMan quantitative
real-time PCR analysis and observed that miR-23a-3p
expression was most downregulated by osthole treatment
(Figure 6B). Furthermore, we try to ectopically express
miR-23a-3p in Du145 cells and found that the endogenous
E-cad level was downregulated after overexpression of
miR-23a-3p in Du145 cells (Figure 6C, upper panel).
Next, to examine whether miR-23a-3p can directly target
the 3’UTR of E-cad, we constructed a luciferase reporter

vector harboring the 3’UTR of E-cad and transfected this
vector combined with the miR-23a-3p mimic or mimic
control into Du145 cells. Results showed that miR-23a3p, but not the mimic control, decreased luciferase activity
(Figure 6C, lower panel). These results suggested that
miR-23a-3p can be suppressed by osthole in Du145 cells
and directly represses E-cad expression through binding to
the 3’UTR of the human E-cad gene. To further verify the
direct effect of miR-23a-3p on cell motility, we ectopically
expressed miR-23a-3p in DU145 cells, and found that
the overexpression of miR-23a-3p significantly reversed
osthole-mediated inhibition of cell invasion (Figure 6D).
In contrast, when we transiently transfected the miR-23a-

3p inhibitor into DU145 cells, the invasive ability was
significantly downregulated compared to control cells
(Figure 6E). Recent studies indicated that miR-23a-3p is
directly induced by TGF-β in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) and lung cancer cells [21,35]. We treated AIPC
cells (PC3 and Du145) cells with 10 ng/ml TGF-β for
different time points (6~24 h) and found that E-cad
downregulation was accompanied by the upregulation
of miR-23a-3p (Figure 6F). Moreover, pretreatment of
Du145 cells with osthole can significantly suppress TGFβ-induced upregulation of mir-23a-3p (Supplementary
Figure S3). Taken together, our results indicate that
osthole suppresses AIPC cell motility might be through
downregulating TGF-β-mediated miR-23a-3p expression.

and as a consequence, it may prevent TGF-β-induced
migration and invasion by prostate cancer cells. To further
understand the molecular signals behind osthole-induced
E-cad expression, we studied the effect of osthole on the
transcriptional repressors Snail, Slug, and Twist, which are
implicated in controlling the EMT. Our study showed that
the protein level of Snail exhibited a rapid decrease after
osthole treatment in DU145 cells. However, protein levels
of Slug and Twist were not affected and only slightly
decreased after osthole treatment. We also found that
osthole attenuated the DNA-binding activity of Snail in
the E-cad promoter region. Otherwise, we found that Snail
was downregulated in osthole-treated PC3 xenografts and
was positively correlated with the histological Gleason
score, overall survival, and PSA level of prostate cancer
patients. Snail is a zinc-finger transcription factor that
can suppress E-cad gene expression via binding to E-box
sequences in the proximal E-cad promoter [37]. Snail
is aberrantly expressed in TGF-β- and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-α-induced EMT, and functions as the key
organizer [38]. Aberrant expression of Snail was reported
to be associated with tumor recurrence and metastasis,
and a poor prognosis in various human cancers [39,40].
Taken together, our results support findings that Snail is
a regulator of tumor metastasis in prostate cancer, and
osthole regulates the expression of E-cad, at least partially,

DISCUSSION
Cadherin switching usually refers to a switch
from the expression of E-cadherin (E-cad) to that of
N-cadherin (N-cad). N-cad promotes motility when
expressed by epithelial cells, and cells that express
more E-cad are less motile [11]. Genetic or epigenetic
alterations in the E-cad gene or alterations in its protein
expression increases invasiveness of tumor cells and
metastasis [36]. In the present study, osthole upregulated
E-cad and downregulated N-cad in DU145 AIPC cells,

androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC).

through transcriptional regulation by Snail. PI3K/Akt
signaling and MAPKs are important downstream effectors
in response to TGF-β-mediated EMT in cancers including
AIPC [41,42]. PI3K/Akt signaling was also reported to
regulate Snail expression in AIPC cells [43]. Our present
study indicated that osthole inhibits TGF-β-mediated Snail
expression by targeting the Akt, ERK, and JNK pathways
in AIPC cells. In addition, Rho proteins, cyclooxygenase
(COX)-2, and Smad signaling are also important for TGFβ-mediated cell motility and the EMT [41,42,44], and the
effects of osthole on these pathways in AIPC cells should
be further elucidated in the future.
The newly identified small noncoding RNAs,
miRNAs, belong to a novel class of gene regulators
that control post-transcriptional regulation of genes by
binding to complementary sequences in the 3’UTRs of
target mRNAs. Deregulation of expression of miRNAs
was reported in various human cancers to regulate the
EMT. For example, the miR-200 family and miR-205
were shown to contribute to the EMT in cancer cells by
directly targeting the transcriptional repressors of E-cad,
ZEB1, and ZEB2 [45,46]. MiR-9 is activated by MYC/
MYCN-mediated E-cad downregulation resulting in
metastases of neuroblastomas and breast tumors [47]. In
addition to osthole-mediated transactivation inhibition of
the E-cad gene, we further investigated which miRNAs
might be involved in osthole-mediated E-cad gene
expression and cell motility in AIPC cells. Combining
data from our miRNA screening profiles and miRNA
target databases, we found that osthole treatment of AIPC
cells downregulated the expression of miR-23a-3p which
revealed the suppressive effect on E-cad and promoting
effect on cell motility.
MiR-23a-3p is highly expressed and acts as
an oncogenic miRNA in various cancers [48]. MiR23a/24/27a is an miRNA cluster located in chromosome
19p13.12 and can be regulated by MAPK signaling
and TGF-β [48]. Previous reports indicated that miR23a/24/27a functions as a growth-promoting and
antiapoptotic factor in HCC cells [35], while miR-23a3p was also shown to promote the growth of gastric
adenocarcinoma cells and downregulate an interleukin-6
receptor [49]. Moreover, miR-23a-3p promotes the
transition of colorectal cancer from the indolent to the
invasive phenotype and the invasive ability of glioma
cells by directly targeting HOXD10 [50]. We found that
expression of miR-23a-3p was suppressed by osthole and
induced by TGF-β in AIPC cells. We suggest that osthole
may suppress TGF-β-mediated miR-23a-3p upregulation
in AIPC cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-23a3p decreased E-cad expression and significantly reversed
osthole-mediated inhibition of cell invasion, while
silencing of miR-23a-3p partially inhibited cell motility.
Taken together, our report showed that miR-23a-3p
regulates the TGF-β-induced EMT via E-cad suppression
in AIPC cells, and osthole can significantly suppress this
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phenomenon. The role of miR-23a-3p in regulating E-cad
in AIPC is consistent with that in a report on lung cancer
[21].
We suggest that osthole inhibits metastasis via
transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of E-cad by
respectively altering Akt/MAPK/Snail pathways and miR23a-3p expression, which was initiated by inhibition of
TGF-β production (Figure 7). These results may warrant
clinical trials of osthole in AIPC.

Cell-viability assay

Immunofluorescence microscopy

5×103 Du145 or PC3 cells were plated in 96-well
plates, treated with osthole (20~80 μM) for 24 h, and then
subjected to a cell-viability assay (MTS assay; Promega,
Madison WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Data were collected from three replicates.

DU145 cells grown on cover slips were treated with
or without osthole and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized, and stained with a primary antibody
against E-cad or N-cad, followed by incubation with a
DyLightTM488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson
Laboratories, West Chester, PA) to observe distributions
of these proteins. Slides were examined and photographed
using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope (Carl
Zeiss Microimaging, Gottingen, Germany). Nuclei were
counterstained with 4’,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).

In vitro wound-closure assay
PC3 cells (3 × 105 cells/well) or DU145 cells (4
× 10 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates for 24 h,
wounded by scratching with a pipette tip, then incubated
with α-MEM or DMEM medium containing 0.5% FBS,
and treated with or without osthole (20~80 μM) for
24 h. Cells were photographed using a phase-contrast
microscope (100×) as previously described [52].

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis
A ChIP analysis was performed as described
previously [54]. DNA immunoprecipitated with
antibodies specific to Snail or the control, rabbit IgG,
was purified and extracted using phenol-chloroform.
Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed with a PCR or
quantitative (q)PCR using specific primers which are
described in supplementary data (Supplementary Table 1).

Transwell invasion assay
Migration and invasion assays were performed
as described previously [53]. Briefly, a transwell
invasion assay used 2 105 cells plated in a Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, Bedford, MA)-coated top chamber and
incubated for 24 h (with a 24-well insert and a pore size of
8 μm; Corning Costar, Corning, NY). In this assay, cells
which had been pretreated for 1 h with osthole (20~80
μM) were plated in medium without serum or growth
factors, and medium supplemented with serum was used
as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber. After 24 h of
incubation, cells that had invaded through the pores were
removed with a cotton swab. Cells on the lower surface of
the membrane were fixed with methanol and stained with
crystal violet. The number of cells invading through the
membrane was counted under a light microscope (×40,
three random fields per well).

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Messenger (m)RNA was isolated and amplified as
described previously [54]. Primer sequences are shown as
supplementary data (Supplementary Table 1).

Western blot analysis
Protein lysates were prepared as described
previously [54]. A Western blot analysis was performed
with primary antibodies for E-cad, β-catenin, N-cad,
vimentin, Snail, Slug, Twist, MMP-2, MMP-9, TGF-β,
Akt, p-Akt, ERK, p-ERK, p38, p-p38, JNK, p-JNK,
α-tubulin, or β-actin.

Flow cytometric analysis
DU145 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS. After cells had grown to subconfluence,
they were rendered quiescent and challenged with 10%
FBS and vehicle or 60 µM osthole. After 24 h, they were
harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS)/0.1% dextrose, and fixed in 70% ethanol at -20
°C. Nuclear DNA was stained with a reagent containing
propidium iodide (PI; 50 mg/mL) and DNase-free RNase
(2 U/mL) and measured using a fluorescence-activated cell
sorter (FACS). The proportion of nuclei in each phase of
the cell cycle was determined using WinMDI 2.9 DNA
analysis software (The Scripps Research Institute, La
Jolla, CA).

In vivo metastasis model
All animal work was performed in accordance
with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of Taipei Medical University. Agematched male severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)
mice, at 6~8 weeks old, were used in assays for tumor
growth and metastasis in an orthotopic graft model.
Luciferase-tagged PC3M cells (5 x 105) were suspended
in Matrigel, and injected into the prostate of SCID mice
using a 30-gauge needle through a lower abdominal
incision. Eight days after tumor cell injection, mice
were randomized into experimental and control groups
according to bioluminescence imaging from the Xenogen
21132

Oncotarget

IVIS-200 system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA) such that
treatment was initiated with similar mean tumor sizes
in each group, and then mice were treated with different
dosages (30 or 100 mg/kg) of osthole or the vehicle control
every other day by intraperitoneal (IP) administration. The
following day after osthole treatment, we used this live
imaging device to mointor the tumor size and location.
Twenty-one days after osthole treatment, animals were
sacrificed, and tumor specimens were resected for
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.

or 3 points, strongly positive. To determine the extent of
Snail expression, 1000 consecutive malignant cells were
counted in the area of strongest staining. The extent of
Snail staining was semiquantitatively scored as 0, positive
in < 1% of cells; 1 point, positive in 1%~25% of cells; 2
points, positive in 25%~50% of cells; 3 points, positive
in 50%~75% of cells; or 4 points, positive in 75%~100%
of cells. We then developed a Snail image score by
multiplying the intensity score (0~3 points) by the extent
score (0~4 points) to represent the expression of Snail in
cancer tissues. Low and high expression levels of Snail
were respectively defined as 0~6 and 8~12 points.

Patients and specimen preparation

DNA transfection

Prostate cancer samples from patients were obtained
with informed consent from Taipei Medical UniversityWan Fang Hospital and Taipei Medical University
Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan (Taipei Medical UniversityWan Fang Hospital Institutional Review Board no.
99049). Pathology files of Wan Fang Hospital and Taipei
Medical University Hospital were searched, and radical
prostatectomy specimens with a pathologic diagnosis of
prostatic adenocarcinoma were identified from March
1999 to December 2011. The pathologic diagnosis and
Gleason scoring were microscopically reconfirmed by
pathologists. Each case was pathologically staged using
the 2002 American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM
staging system. Paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed
surgical specimens from all patients were collected for
IHC staining.

The myr-Akt plasmid was provided by Dr. C. C.
Chen (National Taiwan University). To overexpress Akt,
semiconfluent cultures of DU145 cells in a 6-mm2 Petri
dish were transfected with 5 μg of an empty or expression
vector (pcDNA3.1) using Invitrogen Lipofectamine 2000
Transfection Reagent. After incubation for 24 h, cells
were analyzed for the expression of exogenous Akt by
immunoblotting using an anti-Akt antibody.

3’UTR luciferase reporter assay
DU145 cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 ×
104 cells per well in 6-well cell culture plates. After 24 h
of incubation, cells were co-transfected with an miR-23a3p mimic or negative control and vector containing the
E-cad 3’UTR. The pRL-TK Renilla control vector (0.5 μg)
(Promega) was also co-transfected as an internal control
for transfection efficiency. GenMuteTM siRNA & DNA
Transfection Reagent (SignaGen Laboratories, Ijamsville,
MD) was used for this transfection process according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h
after transfection and analyzed for luciferase activity using
the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).

Tumor IHC
All tumor specimens were embedded in paraffin
blocks and cut in 4-μm sections. All specimens were
deparaffinized and immersed in 10 mM sodium citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven twice for 5 min to
enhance antigen retrieval. After washing, slides were
incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol to quench the
endogenous peroxidase activity. Slides were washed with
PBS and incubated with anti-Ki67, anti-Snail (monoclonal
mouse anti-snail antibody, Biorbyt), and anti-mouse
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies for 2 h at room
temperature. After washing in PBS, slides were developed
with a VECTASTAIN ABC (avidin-biotin complex)
peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and
a 3,3,9-diaminobenzidine (DAB) peroxidase substrate kit
(Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All specimens were deparaffinized and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) which was
used as a light counterstain. IHC results of Ki67 were
scored by taking into account the percentage of positive
detection. IHC results of Snail were classified into two
groups according to the intensity and extent of staining:
the intensity was scored semiquantitatively as 0, negative;
1 point, weakly positive; 2 points, moderately positive;

TaqMan miRNA real-time RT-PCR
To determine expressions of miR-146a, 22-3p,
and 23a-3p from AIPC cell lines, we used a TaqMan
MicroRNA Assay kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad,
CA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 10 ng
of RNA from each cell line was reverse-transcribed using
10 μl of an RT mixture containing dNTPs, RT, an RNase
inhibitor, and 3 μl of the respective primer. The mixture
was incubated at 16 °C for 30 min, 42 °C for 30 min, and
85 °C for 5 min. Real-time PCRs were then carried out
in a total volume of 20 μl of reaction mixture containing
2 μl of the RT product, 10 μl of 2 × TaqMan universal
PCR master mix, 7 μl of water, and 1 μl of the TaqMan
assay probe. All reactions, including the controls, were
