BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this study was to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the antimesothelin immunotoxin SS1(dsFv)PE38 (SS1P) (a recombinant antimesothelin immunotoxin consisting of a murine antimesothelin variable
antibody fragment [Fv] linked to PE38, a truncated portion of Pseudomonas exotoxin A) in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Secondary objectives included tumor
response, SS1P pharmacokinetics, and serum biomarkers of response. METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with stage III or IV,
unresectable, epithelial or biphasic MPM and normal organ functions were eligible. Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 on day 1) and cisplatin
(75 mg/m2 on day 1) were administered every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles with escalating doses of SS1P administered intravenously on
days 1, 3, and 5 during cycles 1 and 2. Tumor response was evaluated every 6 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients received SS1P at
4 dose levels from 25 to 55 mcg/kg. Grade 3 fatigue was dose-limiting in 1 patient at 55 mcg/kg. The MTD of SS1P was established as
45 mcg/kg. Other grade 3 toxicities associated with SS1P included hypoalbuminemia (21%), back pain (13%), and hypotension (8%).
Of 20 evaluable patients, 12 (60%) had a partial response, 3 had stable disease, and 5 had progressive disease. Of 13 patients who
received the MTD, 10 (77%) had a partial response, 1 had stable disease, and 2 had progressive disease. Objective radiologic
responses were associated with significant decreases in serum mesothelin (P5.0030), megakaryocyte potentiating factor (P5.0005),
and cancer antigen 125 (P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: SS1P given with pemetrexed and cisplatin is safe and well tolerated and exhibits
significant antitumor activity in patients with unresectable, advanced pleural mesothelioma. Serum mesothelin, megakaryocyte potentiating factor, and cancer antigen 125 levels correlated with objective tumor responses. Cancer 2014;120:3311-9. Published 2014. This

INTRODUCTION
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. Although patients with limited tumor burden may benefit from surgical resection, most patients with MPM present with advanced disease at diagnosis and
are not candidates for cytoreductive surgery. On the basis of results from a randomized phase 3 trial that demonstrated a
survival benefit over single-agent cisplatin, combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed is the standard firstline therapy for patients who are ineligible for surgery.1 However, response rates to combination chemotherapy are modest
at 41%, and the median overall survival 12.1 months, underscoring the need for new therapies.
An attractive tumor-specific therapy target for mesothelioma is the tumor differentiation antigen mesothelin, a 40kilodalton (kDa) glycoprotein present on normal mesothelial cells that line the pleura, peritoneum, and pericardium.

Original Article

Although the normal biologic function of mesothelin is
unknown, growing evidence suggests that it may play a
role in tumorigenesis and metastasis in certain malignancies.2 Mesothelin is highly expressed in many human epithelial malignancies, including epithelial and biphasic
malignant mesothelioma and ovarian, pancreatic, gastric,
and lung adenocarcinomas.3-6 The limited expression of
mesothelin on normal human tissue and high expression
in many cancers makes it an excellent target antigen for
antibody-based immunotherapy, and several such agents
are currently in clinical trials.7 The mesothelin gene encodes a 70-kDa precursor protein that is cleaved into a soluble 31-kDa fragment, megakaryocyte potentiating factor
(MPF), and a membrane-bound 40-kDa mesothelin.8
Both MPF and membrane-bound mesothelin can be
detected in the serum and are promising biomarkers for
mesothelioma.9-13
SS1(dsFv)PE38 (SS1P) is a recombinant antimesothelin immunotoxin that consists of a murine antimesothelin variable antibody fragment (Fv) linked to PE38, a
truncated portion of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. In a phase
1 clinical trial of patients with advanced Mesothelinexpressing cancers who had failed standard therapies,
bolus administration of SS1P on alternate days for 3
doses was well tolerated. Pleuritis was the dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT), and the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) was 45 mcg/kg.14 The most commonly reported
adverse events (AEs) in the phase 1 trial were hypoalbuminemia and fatigue. In that group of heavily pretreated
patients, SS1P had limited antitumor activity. One reason for a lack of activity of single-agent SS1P could be
the limited tumor penetration from the site density barrier caused by close packing of tumor cells, high interstitial pressure within tumors, and lack of functional
lymphatics.15 In mice with mesothelin-expressing human
tumor xenografts, SS1P had modest antitumor activity
by itself; however, when combined with chemotherapy,
remarkable synergy was observed.16,17 We demonstrated
that, by killing tumor cells, chemotherapy disrupted the
close packing of tumor, allowing better penetration of
immunotoxin into the tumor.18
On the basis of these preclinical data, we designed
this study to determine whether a similar synergistic antitumor effect could be observed in patients with MPM by
combining SS1P with standard chemotherapy. The objectives of this phase 1 study were to assess the recommended
phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety and tolerability, and the
pharmacokinetics (PK) of SS1P when administered in
combination with a standard chemotherapy regimen of
pemetrexed and cisplatin. Secondary objectives included
3312

assessing tumor response and the effectiveness of serum
mesothelin, MPF, and cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) as
biomarkers of tumor response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria

Eligible patients were men and nonpregnant women with
histologically confirmed MPM of an epithelial or biphasic
subtype (those who had biphasic tumors with a predominantly sarcomatoid component were excluded); aged 18
years; a Karnofsky performance status 70; and adequate
bone marrow, lung, liver, and renal functions (the latter
was defined as a serum creatinine clearance 60 mL/minute estimated according to the Cockroft-Gault formula).
Patients must have had measurable stage III or IV disease
that was not amenable to potentially curative surgical resection. Patients who had received prior radiotherapy (with
the exception of palliative, extrathoracic, localized radiotherapy within 4 weeks), biologic therapy (within 4 weeks), or
systemic chemotherapy for pleural mesothelioma were
excluded. Tumor mesothelin expression was not an eligibility criterion, because nearly all epithelial mesotheliomas and
the epithelial component of the biphasic mesothelioma
express mesothelin.8 The protocol was approved by the
Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program and the Intramural
Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer Institute
(Bethesda, Md) and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov
(National Clinical Trials identifier NCT01445392). All
patients provided written informed consent.
Study Design

This was a phase 1 dose-escalation study of SS1P in combination with standard doses of pemetrexed and cisplatin
using a classic 313 design. Patients received pemetrexed
(500 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2) on day 1 of a 21day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles in the absence of
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. SS1P doses
ranging from 25 to 55 mcg/kg were administered intravenously over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 of cycles 1
and 2 only. SS1P was administered only for the first 2
cycles, because previous studies demonstrated that most
patients develop SS1P-neutralizing antibodies after 1 or
2 cycles of treatment.14
Assessments

Computed tomography scans were obtained at baseline,
after every 2 cycles, and regularly during follow-up.
Radiologic tumor response was assessed using the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) Criteria for Mesothelioma.19

SS1P Plus Chemotherapy For Mesothelioma/Hassan et al

AEs were evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
version 4.0.20 The following AEs were considered doselimiting: nonhematologic AEs of grade 3 severity that
were suspected of a causal relation to SS1P, grade 3 vascular leak syndrome (VLS) (defined as a requirement for fluids >20 mL/kg per hour for at least 30 minutes to treat
hypotension), grade 3 hypotension in temporal association with VLS, VLS resulting in symptomatic pulmonary
edema requiring supplemental oxygen or a decrease
>10% in oxygen saturation, grade 4 hematologic AEs
except lymphopenia lasting >5 days, grade 2 allergic reactions of bronchospasm or urticaria, or any grade 3 allergic reaction in the presence of premedication.

tralizing antibodies were determined before treatment,
before the second cycle, and on day 21 (63 days) of the
second cycle. Greater than 75% neutralization of SS1P activity in vitro at an SS1P concentration of 1000 ng/mL
was established as the cutoff for a positive assay based on
previous studies.14
Approximately 2 mL of blood were collected for
SS1P PK analyses at the following time-points during
cycles 1 and 2: for the first dose, before infusion; at the
end of the 30-minute infusion (EOI); and at 1, 1.5, 2, 4,
8, and 12 hours; for the second dose, before infusion and
at EOI; and, for the third dose, before infusion and at
EOI. Samples were centrifuged at 31000g for 15 minutes
at 4oC, and the plasma was transferred to cryovials and
stored at 280 C.

Tumor Mesothelin Expression

Mesothelin immunohistochemistry was performed on tumor samples obtained before therapy using monoclonal
antibody 5B2 (Novocastra/Leica, Bannockburn, Ill) in a
1:40 dilution. Incubation with primary antibody was
preceded by 20 minutes of heat-induced epitope retrieval
in citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Detection was performed using
the Ventana Ultra View detection kit (Ventana Medical
Systems, Inc., Tucson, Ariz) with 3-30 -diaminobenzidine
as the chromogen. Immunohistochemical staining was
evaluated by 1 pathologist with special expertise in
immunohistochemistry. Positive staining (the strength of
labeling) was assessed as negative (no labeling), weak
(11), moderate (21), and strong (31). The percentage
of positive cells also was estimated. The type of labeling
was assessed as either membrane labeling (cell perimeterpositive) or cytoplasmic labeling. Specimens in which
30% of tumor cells had cell surface expression of mesothelin were considered positive.14
Serum Biomarkers

Mesothelin (nmol/L) and MPF levels (ng/mL) were measured in serum using the Mesomark (Fujirebio Diagnostics,
Inc., Malvern, Pa) and a human MPF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Medical & Biological Laboratories,
Nagano, Japan), respectively. CA 125 levels (U/mL) were
measured using an automated commercial assay. All assays
were run according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
were blinded to patient data. Relative changes in mesothelin, MPF, and CA 125 levels were compared with the
patient’s best overall radiologic response during treatment.
SS1P Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetics

Neutralizing antibodies to SS1P were measured retrospectively using a bioassay as described previously.14,21 NeuCancer

Statistical Methods

The primary objective of this study was to determine the
MTD and the RP2D of the combination of SS1P, pemetrexed, and cisplatin in patients with malignant mesothelioma using a standard phase 1 dose-escalation design. In
addition, at the RP2D, an expansion cohort was planned
to further characterize the toxicity profile of the combination, to evaluate the changes in the level of serum mesothelin, and to gain preliminary information regarding
response rates. The association between the relative
changes in biomarker levels and the best overall response
was evaluated using the nonparametric Wilcoxon ranksum test, and associations between the changes in biomarker levels and ordered response categories were
assessed using a Jonckheere-Terpstra test for trend.22 Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad
PRISM software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., La
Jolla, Calif) and SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC). A 2-sided P value <.05 was considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Twenty-four patients were enrolled between May 2008
and October 2011 (Table 1). Patients were predominantly men (83%), had good performance status, and had
a median age of 67 years.
All patients received at least 1 dose of study drug at 1
of 4 dose levels: 25 mcg/kg per dose (n55), 35 mcg/kg
per dose (n53), 45 mcg/kg per dose (n515), or 55
mcg/kg per dose (n51). Twenty-three patients (96%)
completed at least 1 chemotherapy cycle. Of those, 3
patients (13%) completed only 1 cycle, 2 patients (8%)
completed 2 cycles, and 4 patients (17%) completed 4

treatment. Two patients in the 25-mcg/kg per dose cohort
withdrew consent and were replaced. One patient at the
45-mcg/kg per dose level in the expansion cohort with-

drew consent. Another patient at the 45-mcg/kg per dose
level in the expansion cohort died during cycle 1 from
grade 5 pneumonia and neutropenic sepsis related to
chemotherapy.

One patient in the 45-mcg/kg dose-expansion cohort failed to complete
the first cycle of therapy and died from grade 5 pneumonia and neutropenic sepsis.

Of the 24 patients who received treatment, 20 were considered evaluable for response (Fig. 1A). Three patients (2
from dose level 1 and 1 from dose level 3) withdrew from
the trial before the response assessment. One patient died
while on therapy before the response assessment. Of the
20 patients who were evaluable for response, 12 (60%)
had a partial response (PR), 3 (15%) had stable disease
(SD), and 5 (20%) had progressive disease (PD). Of the
13 patients who received the MTD, 10 had a PR (77%), 1
had SD (8%), and 2 had PD (15%). The median overall

(17%). Lower extremity edema was observed mostly during cycle 1 and was self-limiting in most patients, in
whom it resolved within 1 week of completing SS1P.
Common chemotherapy-related toxicities were lymphopenia (75%), anemia (71%), fatigue (58%), neutropenia
(58%), and leukopenia (50%).

strong, (B) moderate, and (C) weak. Areas of brown indicate mesothelin staining of tumor cells.

Treatment-emergent but nondose-limiting toxicities
in the patients who withdrew consent at the 25-mcg/kg
dose level included grade 2 fatigue and hypoalbuminemia
in 1 patient and grade 2 anorexia, edema, fatigue, anemia,
and mucositis and grade 3 hyponatremia in the other
patient. The patient who withdrew consent at the 45mcg/kg dose level developed grade 2 fever and grade 3 hypotension during cycle 2, 1 day after the first dose of
SS1P, which responded to intravenous fluids and antipyretics. Because this event could have been related to SS1P,
the patient did not receive the day-3 or day-5 SS1P
infusions.
Although the protocol allowed additional accrual at
the MTD, we chose to expand accrual to the 45-lg/kg
dose level, because it was declared the RP2D. That decision was based on the tolerability and responses observed
at the 45-lg/kg dose level and taking into consideration
the experience with single-agent SS1P, for which 45 lg/
kg was the MTD.14
Tumor Mesothelin Expression

Eleven of the 12 available tumor samples (92%) stained
positive for mesothelin. Figure 3 depicts representative
immunohistochemical staining of tumor samples, indicating strong, moderate, and weak staining. The predominant pattern was strong membranous and cytoplasmic
mesothelin expression. Strong mesothelin expression in
90% to 100% of tumor cells was observed in 8 tumors.
Six of those patients were evaluable for therapy response:
1 had SD, 1 had PD, and 4 had a PR. Strong-to-moderate
staining in 35% to 65% of cells was observed in 3 tumors:
1 patient had SD, and 2 had a PR.
Biomarker Correlation With Tumor Response

Mesothelin, CA 125, and MPF measurements were available for the 20 patients who were evaluable for response.
For each patient, the relative changes in biomarker levels
3316

were compared with their best overall radiologic response
(SD, PR, or PD) and were displayed in waterfall plots
(Fig. 4). For mesothelin and CA 125 levels, the biomarker
change represented the maximal relative change (negative
or positive) during therapy compared with baseline. For
MPF, only pretherapy and post-therapy levels were
available.
Each of the 20 patients had at least 2 data points at
which all 3 biomarker values were measured. In those 40
matched samples, mesothelin and MPF levels were
strongly correlated (Spearman r50.90; P < .0001),
whereas CA 125 had only a moderate association with
mesothelin (Spearman r50.43; P5.006) and MPF
(Spearman r50.42; P5.007).
The radiologic response of a PR versus less than a
PR was associated significantly with changes in levels of
mesothelin (P5.0030), MPF (P5.0005), and CA 125
(P < .0001) (Fig. 4). In addition, there was a strong, significant correlation in the relative changes over the 3 ordered response categories (PR>SD>PD) for mesothelin
(P5.0004), MPF (P5.0002), and CA 125 (P5.0001).
The 5 patients who had PD typically experienced a substantial increase in biomarker levels; whereas, in the 12
patients who had a PR, the levels generally decreased.
The 3 patients with SD mostly had a decrease in mesothelin and MPF levels but an increase in CA 125 levels.
We also evaluated the accuracy of biomarker changes in
reflecting responses to therapy. A 15% threshold was
considered to avoid interference with assay variance.
Consequently, patients with PD were expected to have
an increase in biomarker levels >15%, whereas those
who had a PR required a decrease <15%. Patients with
SD were required to have no significant change, ie,
between 15% and 215%. Overall, mesothelin correctly
classified 14 of 20 patients (70% accuracy), MPF correctly classified 15 patients (75% accuracy), and CA
125 correctly classified 12 patients (60% accuracy).

These results can be derived from the waterfall plots
(Fig. 4). Baseline mesothelin, MPF, and CA 125 levels
(Table 1) were not predictive of therapy response
(P > .05).
SS1P Immunogenicity and PK Analysis

Before starting treatment, only 1 of the 21 patients (5%)
with data available had serum SS1P-neutralizing antibodies. Maximum serum SS1P concentrations (Cmax) were
low in that patient (10 ng/mL on day 1 of the first cycle),
whereas all patients who did not have neutralizing antibodies (n520; 95%) achieved an SS1P Cmax >150 ng/
mL. After the first cycle, all but 2 of the 21 patients
(90%) developed SS1P-neutralizing antibodies. SS1P

Cmax values >150 ng/mL were achieved during cycle 2
only by the 2 patients who did not develop SS1Pneutralizing antibodies.
All treated patients were included in the PK analysis
(Fig. 5). SS1P Cmax at dose levels 25 mg/kg (n55), 35
mg/kg (n53), and 45 mg/kg (n515) are illustrated in Figure 5A. SS1P Cmax values at different dose levels were
not statistically different, probably because of small
patient numbers in individual groups, and were 1334 ng/
mL at the MTD. The SS1P area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 480 mg/mL per minute, and
the SS1P t1/2 at the MTD was 727 minutes (Fig. 5B,C).
SS1P exposure and t1/2 did not differ statistically between
different dose levels (P > .05).

DISCUSSION
On the basis of preclinical studies that demonstrated striking synergy when SS1P was combined with chemotherapy, we designed this phase 1 clinical trial of SS1P in
combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin in
chemotherapy-na€ıve patients with MPM. Our results indicate that combining SS1P with pemetrexed and cisplatin
is well tolerated and produces no overlapping toxicities.
The results from this trial compare favorably with
those from the phase 3 trial that led to the approval of
pemetrexed and cisplatin for patients with MPM.1 The
pivotal trial reported an objective response rate of 41% in
patients who received pemetrexed and cisplatin compared
with 17% in patients who received cisplatin alone. The
combination of SS1P with cisplatin and pemetrexed
resulted in response rates of 60% in all evaluable patients
and 77% in patients who received the MTD. Although
promising, the response rates reported in this trial should
be interpreted with caution, because this was a phase 1
study with a limited number of patients.
Common SS1P-related AEs included weight gain,
edema, hypoalbuminemia, and pleuritic pain. Pleuritic
chest pain is caused by an inflammatory response from
SS1P binding to the mesothelin expressed on normal
pleural mesothelial cells. Pleuritic pain was experienced either during or within a few hours of SS1P infusion, was
transient, and responded well to narcotic analgesics.
Other SS1P-related AEs were because of VLS, which
resulted in leakage of fluid from the circulation into the
tissues, edema, and a decrease in serum protein levels.
However, VLS was mild and was not dose-limiting.
We determined the antibody response to SS1P using
a neutralization assay that measured the ability of patient
serum to neutralize the activity of SS1P against a
mesothelin-expressing cell line in vitro. SS1P-neutralizing
antibodies were present in 5% of patients before treatment and in 90% of patients after 1 cycle of treatment.
During cycles 1 and 2, the neutralization of SS1P activity
correlated with markedly lower serum SS1P levels, suggesting that antibodies neutralized SS1P activity.
Development of neutralizing antibodies precluded
administration of additional cycles of SS1P. The development of SS1P-neutralizing antibodies at a rate comparable
to that achieved with single-agent SS1P administration
indicates that concurrent chemotherapy does not affect
antibody formation.14 Strategies being explored to minimize immunogenicity and allow for repeated therapeutic
administration of SS1P include modification of the
immunotoxin protein structure to decrease its immunogenicity and/or host immune depletion.23,24 In a pilot

study, we recently demonstrated that host immune depletion can effectively delay antibody formation.25 Of 10
patients who received pentostatin and cyclophosphamide
to deplete T cells and B cells before SS1P, only 2 patients
(20%) developed anti-SS1P antibodies at the end of cycle
1. Three patients with extensive disease who had received
multiple prior treatments had durable PRs and remained
alive >14 months after starting treatment. Future studies
of immunotoxins in combination with chemotherapy
should incorporate strategies to minimize neutralizing
antibody formation.
Objective radiologic assessment of MPM is notoriously difficult,19 hence the need for biomarkers of
response. Previous reports indicated that serum levels of
mesothelin, MPF, and CA 125 are potential markers of
response in mesothelioma.26-28 We confirmed those findings and were able to demonstrate that changes in mesothelin and MPF levels are better than changes in CA 125
levels for reflecting tumor response. Validation studies in
a larger cohort are warranted to assess the use of serum
biomarkers as an adjuvant to radiologic evaluation of therapy response. It is noteworthy that baseline levels of mesothelin, MPF, and CA 125 did not predict response to
SS1P and chemotherapy. The same appears to be true for
mesothelin tumor staining, although available data were
limited.
The results from this phase 1 trial indicate that SS1P
can be safely combined with chemotherapy. Although the
objective response rate appears to be higher than that
reported in historical controls who received chemotherapy
alone, the rapid development of antibodies likely hampered the efficacy of SS1P. Ongoing translational efforts
are focused on minimizing the immunogenicity of SS1P
and optimizing the efficacy of this combination.
