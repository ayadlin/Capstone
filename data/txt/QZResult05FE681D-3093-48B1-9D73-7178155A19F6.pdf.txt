ABSTRACT
To investigate the effects and mechanism of diosmetin on acute hepatic
failure (AHF), an AHF murine model was established through administration of
lipopolysaccharides/D-galactosamine (LPS/D-GalN). In vitro, diosmetin scavenged
free radicals. In vivo, diosmetin decreased mortality among mice, blocked the
development of histopathological changes and hepatic damage, and suppressed
levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. In addition, diosmetin prevented
the expression of phosphorylated IKK, IκBα, and NF-κB p65 in the NF-κB signaling
pathway, and JNK and p38 in the MAPK signaling pathway. Diosmetin also inhibited
hepatocyte apoptosis. Thus, diosmetin exerts protective effects against endotoxininduced acute hepatic failure in mice. The underlying mechanisms are antioxidation,
NF-κB signaling inhibition, inflammatory mediator/cytokine attenuation, and
hepatocyte apoptosis suppression. Diosmetin is thus a potential drug candidate for
use in the treatment of acute hepatic failure.

INTRODUCTION

for liver failure because these therapies result in fewer
traumas, are relatively simple to apply, cost less, and are
reversible and repeatable [8, 9]. Unfortunately, cell-based
therapies are not appropriate for most patients. Therefore,
a continuing search for a promising hepatoprotective agent
is necessary.
Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is important for
liver physiology and function [10] because it can be
activated by many different stimuli and it maintains tissue
homeostasis, controls disease development, promotes
cell survival and activates innate and adaptive immune
responses. The expression of several genes involved
in the inflammatory response, including inducible nitic
oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),
and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), is activated at the
transcriptional level by the inducible transcription factor
NF-κB [11]. The NF-κB signaling pathway is a factor

Acute hepatic failure (AHF) is defined as the sudden
clinical syndrome of severe hepatocellular dysfunction
accompanied by hepatic encephalopathy in a healthy
human [1, 2]. The loss of hepatocellular function leads
to metabolic derangements, including clotting factor
synthesis, gluconeogenesis and ureogenesis, impairment
of plasma detoxification, neurologic complications, and
ultimately, multiorgan failure [3]. AHF has a variety of
etiologies, such as viral hepatitis [4], excessive alcohol
[5], and drug-induced hepatotoxicity [6]. When patients
experience life-threatening liver failure, no effective
therapy is available apart from liver transplantation [7].
Liver transplantation is not widely used because of the
shortage of donor livers and the expense of transplantation.
Some researchers have considered cell-based therapies

in several liver diseases, including hepatitis, cirrhosis,
and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, the NF-κB
signaling pathway is a potential target for hepatoprotective
agents such as antioxidants and nuclear factor kappa-B
kinase (IKK) inhibitors. These drugs disrupt activity at
different levels and treat liver disease [12].
Diosmetin (DIOS [3´, 5, 7-trihydroxy-4´methoxyflavone]) (Figure 1) is a bioflavonoid that
is abundant in citrus fruits [13], legume leaves, and
spermin. DIOS exerts antioxidant [14], anti-inflammatory
[15-18], antiapoptotic [19], antimutagenic [20], and
antibacterial [21] effects. DIOS promotes strong cellular
antioxidant activity in human monocytes by preventing
the generation of intracellular ROS and the formation of
malondialdehyde (MDA), and by increasing the effects
of the intracellular antioxidant enzymes superoxide
dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione
peroxidase (GPx) [14]. DIOS exerts an anti-inflammatory
effect by reducing NO production and TNF-α release
induced by lipopolysaccharides in murine microglia and
macrophages [15]. DIOS suppresses mouse-ear edema
induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl- phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)
[16] and decreases the enzyme activities of p38α mitogenactivated-protein kinase (p38α) and c-Jun-N-terminal
kinase 3 (JNK3) [17]. In addition, DIOS suppresses
apoptosis in T48 cells by the activation of protein kinase B
(AKT) and protein kinase B (ERK) phosphorylation [19].
However, little information about the protective effect of
DIOS on LPS-induced acute hepatic failure is available.
Therefore, this study was performed to determine its
interaction and potential mechanism in a murine model.

6.36, 0.034, and 0.43 mM, respectively. The inhibition
of ·OH by DIOS pretreatment exhibited an extremely
significant difference (P < 0.01) compared with the
positive control Trolox (IC50 = 0.27 mM) (Figure 2).

Effects of DIOS on LPS/D-GalN-induced
mortality and histopathological changes
The effect of DIOS pretreatment on LPS/DGalN-induced mortality in mice is depicted in Figure
3. All mice in the control and DIOS groups survived
for 24 hours. However, after administration of LPS/DGalN, the mice started to die at 8 hours, and up to 100%
mortality had occurred at 12 hours. At 24 hours after
administration of LPS/D-GalN, mortality only reached
30% in mice pretreated with DIOS. Thus, DIOS+LPS/
D-GalN decreased LPS/D-GalN-induced mortality in
mice. The effect of DIOS pretreatment on LPS/D-GalNinduced histopathological changes is shown in Figure
4. Histological analysis of the mouse hepatic tissue
was performed with H&E staining assay. The hepatic
architectures in the control and DIOS groups were
normal. Administration of LPS/D-GalN caused significant
histological changes, including inflammatory infiltration,
hepatocyte necrosis, hemorrhage, and the loss of hepatic
architectures-vacuolation. By contrast, pretreatment
with DIOS effectively blocked the development of
histopathological changes induced by LPS/D-GalN.

Effects of DIOS on hepatic damage and oxidative
and inflammatory markers

RESULTS

Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT
and AST) activities were measured to evaluate hepatic
damage (Figure 5). Administration of LPS/D-GalN
significantly increased ALT and AST. Pretreatment with
DIOS decreased ALT and AST and resulted in a significant
difference (DIOS+LPS/D-GalN vs LPS/D-GalN, P < 0.01
and P < 0.05, respectively). DIOS pretreatment attenuated
the hepatic damage induced by LPS/D-GalN.
The quantitative analysis of nitic oxide synthase
(iNOS), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT),
superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total antioxidant
capacity (T-AOC) serves as the assessment of LPS/DGalN-induced oxidant damage (Figure 6 and Table 1). The
enzyme activities of CAT, SOD, and T-AOC decreased
in the LPS/D-GalN group and increased in the DIOS
treatment group. However, the levels of iNOS and MDA
increased in the LPS/D-GalN group and were suppressed
by DIOS+LPS/D-GalN.
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and COX-2 are critical
accelerators of pathogenesis and have emerged as
therapeutic targets in inflammatory diseases. The enzyme
activities of COX-2 and PGE2 are determined in Table 1.
After the administration of LPS/D-GalN, the two activities

Effects of DIOS on the MAPK signaling pathway

activation of NF-κB (p65), which is the major subunit
of NF-κB, the effect of DIOS on the transcription of
p65 still needed to be studied. As shown in Figure 8, the
expression of p65 in the nucleus was measured more than
that in the cytosol of the LPS/D-GalN group. However,
the expression of p65 in the nucleus was reduced after
treatment with DIOS. Protein levels of proinflammatory
cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleulin-6 (IL-6), increased
in the LPS/D-GalN group and decreased in the DIOS
+LPS/D-GalN group (Figure 9). The inhibitory effect of
DIOS on acute hepatic failure is perhaps related to the NFκB signaling pathway.

The phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPK
proteins were triggered and increased in the LPS/D-GalN
group (Figure 10). The phosphorylated levels of JNK and
p38 MAPK proteins were reduced in the DIOS+LPS/DGalN group. The phosphorylation of ERK remained
unchanged in the DIOS+LPS/D-GalN group. The result
indicated that DIOS inhibited the JNK and p38 MAPK
proteins in the MAPK family without affecting ERK. The
MAPK signaling pathway might correlate with the DIOS
anti-inflammation properties.

LPS/D-GalN, respectively. However, pretreatment with
DIOS prevented the expression of Bax and increased the
expression of Bcl-2. The Bcl-2/Bax ratio increased in this
condition. The expression of caspase 3, 8, and 9 increased

mortality, inflammatory infiltration, hepatocyte necrosis,
hemorrhage, and the loss of hepatic architectures
induced by LPS/D-GalN. Furthermore, DIOS attenuated
histopathological changes and diminished the activities of
ALT and AST stimulated by endotoxin.
Oxidative stress reflects the imbalance between
the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such
as superoxide radicals (O2·-), singlet oxygen, hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and the
biochemical mechanisms that detoxify and repair the
damage resulting from reactive intermediates [23, 24].
Oxidative stress damages lipids, proteins, and DNA,
which results in cell growth arrest, senescence, or death
[25], and many disease processes of clinical interest have
oxidative stress as an underlying etiology. In the present
study, treatment with DIOS inhibited O2·-, ·OH, DPPH,
and ABTS+, and DIOS strongly scavenged MDA in
mouse serum, which acted as an intracellular radical in
the inflammatory response. iNOS has been implicated in

DISCUSSION
The liver performs hundreds of critical functions to
maintain homeostasis and health. The liver disease AHF
severely affects health and is life threatening. Thus, finding
a hepatoprotective agent is vital for clinical therapy.
LPS and D-GalN-induced hepatitis is a wellestablished model of liver injury promoted by
macrophages [22]. In this study, an AHF murine model
was established successfully with i.p. injection of LPS/
D-GalN. Administration of DIOS prevented the high

both DNA damage induction and aberrant cell signaling in
various tissue and cells [26]. Our result demonstrated that
the level of iNOS increased with administration of LPS/DGalN. However, treatment with DIOS suppressed iNOS
activity. SOD and CAT are major radical-scavenging
antioxidant enzymes in the human body [27]. SOD
catalyzes the highly reactive superoxide anion O2·- into
O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). CAT converts the

H2O2 generated within cells to H2O and O2 and prevents
the conversion of H2O2 into a more active species, such
as ·OH. Total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) served as a
preventive index of oxidant damage. Our results indicated
that administered LPS/D-GalN reduced the activities
of SOD and CAT and attenuated T-AOC capacity.
Pretreatment with DIOS reduced LPS/D-GalN-induced
depression of SOD and CAT.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potent lipid activator
produced by the inducible form of the enzyme COX2 in inflammatory cells. PGE2 and COX-2 are critical
accelerators of pathogenesis and therefore have emerged
as therapeutic targets in inflammatory diseases [28]. Our
results demonstrated that pretreatment with DIOS reduced
the enzyme activities of COX-2 and PGE2, which were
increased significantly by the administration of LPS/DGalN.
NF-κB is one of the major transcription factors
for gene expression in the inflammatory response. The
activation of NF-κB is triggered by the phosphorylation
of IκB, and then NF-κB is dissociated from the inactive
cytoplasmic complex. IκB is phosphorylated by IκB
kinases (IKKs), which results in its ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation. Degradation of IκBα results in
the release of NF-κB p65 and causes the translocation
of activated NF-κB into the nucleus, which then causes

the transcription of target genes [29-31]. Along with
the NF-κB activation, the levels of several cytokines,
such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, involved in apoptosis
and inflammation, increased. Our findings revealed that
pretreatment with DIOS blocked the phosphorylation of
IKK, IκBα, and NF-κB p65, reduced the expression of p65
in the nucleus, and decreased the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and
TNF-α. The inhibitory effect of DIOS on AHF induced
by LPS/D-GalN is increased by the NF-κB signaling
pathway.
ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK are the main
components of the MAPK family. The MAPK pathway
has emerged as one of the major factors in the intracellular
signaling cascades that are part of the pro-inflammatory
response [32, 33]. In this study, we demonstrated that
administration of LPS/D-GalN initiated the activation
of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. Pretreatment with DIOS
blocked the phosphorylated JNK and p38 MAPK. The

MAPK signaling pathway might correlate with the DIOS
anti-inflammation properties.
The MAPK signaling pathways promote a variety of
cellular activities, including proliferation and apoptosis,
in response to certain stimuli. The anti-apoptotic protein
(Bcl-2) and the pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) are the
two types of Bcl-2 family proteins. Bak and some proapoptotic proteins stimulate cell apoptosis, but Bcl-2
inhibits apoptosis [34]. The Bcl-2/Bax ratio as an index is

more important than either promoter alone in determining
apoptosis. Our results indicated that DIOS administration
increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio induced by LPS/D-GalN.
After hepatocytes were stimulated by LPS/D-GalN,
mitochondrial ultrastructural damage was caused by
caspase-mediated apoptosis. Caspase family proteases
(caspase 3, 8, and 9) triggered the apoptotic process [35].
Administration of DIOS, reduced the phosphorylated
levels of caspase 3, 8, and 9 compared with LPS/D-

GalN. The result revealed that DIOS inhibited hepatocyte
apoptosis.
We found that pretreatment with DIOS attenuated
AHF in mice induced by LPS/D-GalN endotoxin. The
underlying mechanism of DIOS inhibition of AHF is
suppression of oxidative stress, attenuation of hepatocyte
apoptosis, decrease of the production of inflammatory
mediator/cytokines, and block of the activation of the NFκB and MAPK signaling pathways, with restraint of the
expression and phosphorylation of the relevant proteins.
Therefore, DIOS has potential as a therapy for AHF.

the final saline treatment, the mice were injected with
LPS/D-GalN (LPS, 10 μg/kg bodyweight; D-GalN, 400
mg/kg body weight, dissolved in saline). The DIOS+LPS/

Western blot assay

The authors state that they have no conflicts of
interest.

A western blot assay was performed to observe
the protein expression of the related signaling pathways
and apoptosis in livers. The liver tissue lysate was
separated with 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked in 10%
skim milk at 37oC for 1.5 hours and incubated overnight
at 4oC with primary antibodies directed against NF-κB
p65 (1:2500), phosphor(p)-IKK (1:1000), p-IκB (1:1000),
p-ERK (1:1000), p-JNK (1:1000), p-38 (1:1000), and
β-actin antibody (1:5000) used as loading controls, and
then incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hours with
secondary antibodies of IgG-HRP-conjugated. Target
proteins were visualized and quantitated by use of Image
Jet software and β-actin as an internal standard.

Paraffin-embedded liver sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase
activity was blocked with 3% H2O2 in methanol. Antigen
retrieval was performed with a 1-mM EDTA buffer (pH
= 9.0) in a microwave for 3 minutes. The nonspecific
protein binding was blocked by goat serum for 30 minutes.
The following steps were performed per the instructions
in the HistostainTM -Plus and DAB substrate kits. The
sections were incubated with primary antibodies, and
then continuously incubated with biotin-labeled goat
antirabbit IgG-HRP. Sections were developed with 3,
3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution and counterstained
with hematoxylin. Images were captured with a light
microscope (magnification 400×; Nikon Eclipse Ti-SR)
and representative images were presented.
