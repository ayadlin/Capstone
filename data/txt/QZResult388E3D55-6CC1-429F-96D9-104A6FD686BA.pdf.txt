BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine (20 ,20 -difluorodeoxycytidine) administration after resection of pancreatic cancer
improves both disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) mediates the ratelimiting catabolic step in the activation of gemcitabine. The authors of this report studied patient outcomes according to the expression of dCK after a postoperative gemcitabine-based chemoradiation regimen. METHODS: Fortyfive patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma received adjuvant gemcitabine based-therapy in the context
of multicenter phase 2 studies. Their tumors were evaluated retrospectively for dCK protein expression by immunohistochemistry. A composite score based on the percentage of dCK-positive cancer cells and the intensity of staining
was generated, and the results were dichotomized at the median values. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 19.95
months (95% confident interval [CI], 3.3-107.4 months). The lymph node (LN) ratio and dCK protein expression were
significant predictors of DFS and OS in univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, dCK protein expression was the
only independent prognostic variable (DFS: hazard ratio [HR], 3.48; 95% CI, 1.66-7.31; P ¼ .001; OS: HR, 3.2; 95%
CI,1.44-7.13; P ¼ .004). CONCLUSIONS: dCK protein expression was identified as an independent and strong prognostic factor in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma who received adjuvant gemcitabine therapy. The
authors concluded that it deserves prospective evaluation as a predictive biomarker for patient selection. Cancer

Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have a poor prognosis despite curative-intent surgical resection, with a
5-year overall survival (OS) rate of approximately 20%. Randomized trials suggest that the outcome of these patients is
improved by the administration of gemcitabine.1,2 Gemcitabine is a 20 20 -difluoro-20 -deoxycytidine nucleoside analogue
that inhibits DNA replication and repair and is a prodrug that is phosphorylated by deoxycitidine kinase (dCK) to its
mononucleotide in the rate-limiting step of its cellular anabolism. Subsequent nucleotide kinases convert gemcitabine
monophosphate to its active metabolites, gemcitabine diphosphate and gemcitabine triphosphate.3,4 The de novo DNA
synthesis pathway is blocked through inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM) by gemcitabine diphosphate.5
In addition to its cytotoxic effect, gemcitabine is a potent radiosensitiser. Recent in vivo studies have confirmed these
observations and have demonstrated significant tumor growth delay with the combination of gemcitabine and ionizing
radiation in animal models.6-9 These results have prompted a variety of adjuvant clinical trials using gemcitabine in combination with radiation therapy.7-13 In the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study RTOG 9704,14 gemcitabine was

compared with bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as adjuvant
chemotherapy after pancreatic cancer resection. In that
phase 3 study, all patients received radiation with a concurrent, continuous infusion of 5-FU sandwiched
between chemotherapy during 1 month (gemcitabine or
5-FU) before and 3 months of chemotherapy afterward.
Specific to tumors located in the pancreatic head, patients
in the gemcitabine group had a trend toward better median survival (20.5 months vs 16.9 months in the 5-FU
group; P ¼ .09). It is noteworthy that the authors of that
study subsequently focused their attention on gemcitabine
sensitivity and on human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), an equilibrative nucleoside transporter
(NT) that is the primary gatekeeper for intracellular
uptake of gemcitabine. hENT1 protein expression has
been associated significantly with improvements in OS
and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with pancreatic
cancer who received gemcitabine, but not in patients who
received 5-FU.15 That study demonstrated that hENT1 is
a useful predictive biomarker rather than simply a prognostic biomarker.
Recently, our team demonstrated that both hENT1
expression and human concentrative NT 3 (hCNT3)
expression were predictive of patient outcomes in a cohort
of patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma who
received an adjuvant combination of gemcitabine and
radiation.16 We hypothesized that the level of dCK within
pancreatic adenocarcinoma also may be a determinant of
gemcitabine efficacy and may refine the identification
of those patients who will derive a particular benefit
from this therapy. For this reason, we investigated the
expression of dCK and sought associations with patient
outcomes in a series of patients with resected adenocarcinoma who were treated on adjuvant gemcitabine-based
clinical trials.

Adjuvant Treatment Plan
Treatment was planned to start within 8 weeks after surgery. Each patient was assigned to receive 2 cycles of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 weekly as a 30-minute infusion for
3 of 4 weeks on Days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43. After a
1-week rest, chemoradiation was started. Gemcitabine
300 mg/m2 as a 30-minute infusion was given weekly for
5 consecutive weeks and was administered 4 hours before
radiation. Patients received 40 gays (Gy) (n ¼ 15) to 50.4
Gy (n ¼ 30) according to trial design.11,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunohistochemistry
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 246 through 260
of the human dCK protein.17 Tissues on slides were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol to water. Endogenous peroxidase
was quenched in 3% H2O2 for 10 minutes. Antigen retrieval was performed using the RHS-2 (Milestone Inc.,
Atlanta, Ga) Microwave Rapid Histoprocessor in high
pH Target Retrieval Solution (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) followed by rinsing in water for 10 minutes. Tissues were incubated with the dCK polyclonal antibody at
a dilution of 1:1200 at 4 C overnight in a humidified
container. Slides were washed 2 times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 minutes. For the secondary antibody, the Antirabbit EnVisionþ System-HRP (Dako)
was used to incubate the tissues at room temperature for
30 minutes. Slides were washed twice in PBS, and the tissues were incubated with 3,30 ,diaminobenzidine (Dako)
for 3 minutes; then, the slides were rinsed in water for
10 minutes followed by a soak in 1% copper sulfate for
5 minutes. Hematoxylin was used to counterstain the tissues. The slides were dipped 3 times in saturated lithium
carbonate and rinsed in water, and the tissues were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and xylene,
then coverslipped. Tonsil was used as a positive control.
The primary antibody was replaced with PBS for the negative control.

Patient Specimens
Paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from 45 primary
ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas were obtained
from the Surgical Pathology archives of the Belgian centers that included patients in 2 phase 2 Belgian multicentric studies.11,12 For each patient, 1 representative block
of the infiltrating primary carcinoma was selected. Clinicopathologic and treatment data were obtained for each
patient from the medical records. The project was
approved by the relevant institutional review boards.

Evaluation of dCK Staining
Quantitative scoring using light microscopy was performed by a single pathologist (R.L.) who was blinded to
clinical characteristics and outcomes. Cytoplasmic and
nuclear staining was scored separately. Cytoplasmic staining was used for the evaluation of dCK protein expression.
Immunohistochemical results were scored only in invasive
adenocarcinoma cells. Staining of dCK protein was
assigned a score from 0 to 2 based on staining intensity

(no staining ¼ 0, weakly positive staining ¼ 1, and
strongly positive staining ¼ 2). The percentage of adenocarcinoma cells stained at each intensity level was
recorded for each specimen. A final score was determined by multiplying the intensity score and the percentage of the positive cells in the specimen, as described
previously.16 Therefore, the weighted scores ranged
between 0 and 200.
Statistical Methods
DFS was calculated from the date of curative-intent radical resection to the date of first recurrence or last followup, and OS was calculated from the date of surgery to the
date of death or last follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to plot DFS and OS, and the log-rank
test was used to compare curves. A Cox proportional hazards multivariate model was used to corroborate the association between clinical and pathologic factors and tumor
expression of dCK related to the efficacy of adjuvant
radiochemotherapy in terms of DFS and OS. Multivariate
analyses used a step-down procedure based on the likelihood ratio test. A P value 0.1 in univariate analysis was
required to consider the variable for multivariate analysis.
Data were analyzed using the SPSS software package (version 10.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill). Statistical significance
was prespecified at P<.05.

RESULTS
Patient Treatment and Outcome
In total, 45 patients who underwent curative (R0) resection for adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head were studied. These included 23 men and 22 women. The median
performance was 0 (range, 0-1), and the a median patient
age was 58 years (range, 34-83 years). Characteristics of
the study patients are listed in Table 1.
Adjuvant chemoradiation regimens were tolerated
well and were completed by 43 of 45 patients (95%).
World Health Organization grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities were reported in 10 of 45 patients (21%), and
grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities were reported in 3
of 45 patients (7%). The median follow-up after surgery
was 21.9 months (range, 3.3-107.4 months). Overall,
the median DFS and OS were 13 months (range,
1-107.4 months) and 21.9 months (range, 3-107.4
months), respectively. At the last follow-up, 30 patients
had died of disease recurrence, and 15 patients remained
alive.

dCK Immunostaining:
Among the 45 resected pancreatic cancer samples, all tumor samples had detectable cytoplasmic labeling for dCK
with heterogeneous staining intensity (intensity score, 1þ
and/or 2þ); staining intensity varied within some tumors
and between individual tumors. Nuclear staining was
observed in 25 of 45 samples (55.5%) and was restricted
exclusively to carcinoma cells that exhibited high cytoplasmic intensity staining (score, 2þ). Positive labeling also
was observed within normal lymphocytes, acinar cells,
and islets, although the most consistent labeling for dCK
was noted within lymphocytes. Thus, lymphocytes served
as a useful positive internal control for evaluating staining
patterns in the neoplastic cells.
Only cytoplasmic immunostaining was considered
for statistical analysis. We dichotomized dCK cytoplasmic
staining based on the median staining score. By using this
criterion, the cutoff score was 140, and patients were divided in 2 groups: 1) low dCK expression, with a staining
score <140, and 2) high dCK expression, with a staining
score 140 (Fig. 1, top).

univariate analysis (greatest tumor dimension, lymph

This analysis revealed that dCK abundance was the only
independent risk factor for death (OS: HR, 3.61; 95%CI,
1.74-7.51; P ¼ .001) and was the sole independent risk
factor for recurrence (DFS: HR, 3.22; 95%CI, 1.566.65]; P ¼ .002) (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
Although evidence is emerging for the benefit of postoperative gemcitabine in the setting of resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma, such treatment carries some toxicity and is
not without financial costs. Means with which to predict
which patients are most likely to benefit from such treatment are needed, and determining the mediators of gemcitabine resistance may facilitate further improvements in
patient outcomes. Recently, it was demonstrated that
immunohistochemical assessment of the NT protein
hENT1 has predictive value of hENT1 immunohistochemistry for assessing the benefit from gemcitabine adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early stage pancreatic
cancer.15 However, after intracellular entry mediated by
NTs, several enzymes involved in gemcitabine metabolism, such as dCK, cytidine deaminase, RRM1, and
RRM2, also may have a key role in altering intracellular
disposition of the drug and determining response to gemcitabine. These proteins have had limited evaluation as
biomarkers in pancreatic carcinoma. Single, small, retrospective, clinical studies have suggested the poor prognostic value of high levels of RRM1 or RRM2 gene
expression and low deoxycytidine kinase protein expression in patients with pancreatic cancer who were treated
with gemcitabine.18-20
Our data demonstrate a strong and statistically significant correlation between low levels of dCK protein
expression in pancreatic cancer and poor clinical outcomes after gemcitabine-based adjuvant therapy. This
finding remained significant on multivariate analyses after
adjusting for standard clinicopathologic prognostic factors. It is noteworthy that dCK protein expression was the
only significant independent markers of DFS and OS and
conferred better prognostic information than lymph node
involvement, the lymph node ratio, and the greatest tumor diameter. These results suggest that, for resected pancreatic cancer patients who are treated with gemcitabine,
dCK evaluation could provide additional and potentially
more powerful information that is not provided readily by

standard prognostic factors. Only 1 previous study evaluated the prognostic value of dCK expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.20 In a retrospective cohort of 32
patients who received gemcitabine (either as a single
agent or in combination) for either metastatic or resected
disease, the investigators reported low dCK expression
was associated significantly with decreased OS. The
results of our study, which was conducted in a homogeneous population of patients who received treatment in
the context of prospective trials evaluating the adjuvant
gemcitabine regimen, substantiate and enhance the
results of that earlier report.20
In our study, dCK immunostaining was predominantly cytoplasmic, although nuclear staining was
observed in specimens that exhibited high levels of cytoplasmic dCK protein. This immunostaining pattern is
consistent with previous reports.21,23 Furthermore, the
reported literature supports a cytoplasmic cellular localization of dCK on the basis of immunochemistry, immu-

noblotting of cellular fractions, enzymatic activity studies,
and kinetic isotope incorporation experiments.21–27
Limitations of our current study include its retrospective nature and the lack of controls who did not
receive gemcitabine. Consequently, the predictive value of
dCK in gemcitabine-treated pancreatic carcinoma (ie, the
ability to identify those patients most likely to benefit
from gemcitabine) could not be assessed formally.
In conclusion, dCK expression was identified as an
independent prognostic factor in patients with resected
pancreatic cancer who received gemcitabine-based therapy. In our efforts to guide treatment decision for patients
with resected pancreatic cancer, we might define gemcitabine sensitivity and resistance better in an integrated analysis of the expression of dCK, hENT1, and hCNT3 in a
larger cohort of similar patients, ideally within the context
of a randomized controlled trial. In this manner, it may be
possible to more precisely define those subgroups of
patients who derive particular benefit from adjuvant
