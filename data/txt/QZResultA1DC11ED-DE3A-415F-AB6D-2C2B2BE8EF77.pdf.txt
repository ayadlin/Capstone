Novel Agents in Myeloma: An
Exciting Saga
Tomer Mark, MD, Ruben Niesvizky, MD, and Morton Coleman, MD

A therapeutic renaissance in the history of cancer therapy has been unfolding with the recent development
of what has been termed the ‘novel agents’ for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Less than a decade
ago, MM therapy was in the doldrums and had been that way for decades. There had been a prolonged period during which few inroads had been made into the median survival of 3 to 5 years for patients with active
MM. Other than bisphosphonates, the mainstays of therapy consisted of the alkylating agents melphalan
and, to a lesser degree, cyclophosphamide.1-3 Combining alkylating agents into a triple therapy regimen had
been considered a step forward by some, but in actuality represented simply more intense therapy. High-dose
corticosteroids helped improve response rates, but the contributions of vincristine and doxorubicin in the classic
VAD program, although initially exciting and widely adopted, were later proven to be marginal.4,5 Autologous
stem cell transplantation (ASCT), using primarily high-dose melphalan, changed the landscape of treatment in
the 1990s after it was shown to produce complete remission rates of approximately 20% and perhaps extend
overall survival compared with traditional therapies.6 For this reason, ASCT was and still remains the gold standard therapy. Its incorporation into the backbone of intensive treatment regimens, most notably the Total Therapy regimen developed at the University of Arkansas, has resulted, according to their data, in the doubling in
long-term survival to 5 to 6 years.7 Unfortunately, high-dose chemotherapy is not a cure, and although it has
been used successfully in patients aged >70 years, it is not considered to be applicable to MM patients with a
particularly frail health status.8-10 The introduction within the past decade of thalidomide, lenalidomide, and
bortezomib has dramatically altered the landscape of myeloma therapy. They are now being used alone, in combination, and as an adjunct to ASCT. Their development and use represent an exciting story in the annals of cancer therapy.
In the late 1990s an assemblage of a determined and insistent wife of a heavily pretreated MM patient, a
receptive and innovative group of physicians in Arkansas, and a biotech company came together to provide the
first major breakthrough in years with the use of thalidomide. Thalidomide was the infamous drug that had been
shelved for years because of its teratogenic properties when used as a sedative and morning sickness aid in 1960s
Europe. The tragic phocomelia found in newborns from mothers who had been using thalidomide was discovered
to result from altered blood vessel formation. This led to the trial of thalidomide in MM for its putative antiangiogenic properties based on the observation that the more aggressive or advanced the MM, the greater the vascularity. As is nearly universal in cancer therapy, endstage, refractory, or previously treated patients were the initial
recipients of this novel therapy. Indeed, nearly all of the patients had received extensive treatment and had limited

bone marrow reserve. Despite these severe drawbacks, thalidomide produced responses in approximately one-third
of patients, although some of the responses were minor
(the MM immunoglobulin levels declined by less than
half).11 Thalidomide was particularly useful because of its
minimal myelosuppression. Subsequently, we at Cornell
and others observed that the addition of steroids greatly
augmented the therapeutic effect of thalidomide in previously treated patients.12 When combining thalidomide
and dexamethasone, successful responses occurred in well
over half the patients. Our program at Cornell administered thalidomide only in low doses, dexamethasone once
weekly, and added clarithromycin. With this regimen,
called B-LTD (Biaxin, low-dose thalidomide, dexamethasone), responses exceeded 90%.13 Whether the enhanced
response in our program reflected differences in patient
selection (1 of many problems in comparing phase 2
results), an effect of clarithromycin on the MM or the metabolism of the other 2 drugs, or the use of once-weekly
high-dose dexamethasone is unclear. Clarifying this question somewhat is the recent observation that weekly
(referred to as ‘low dose’) dexamethasone has been proven
superior to the ‘classical’ Barlogie method of spaced 4 continuous days ‘pulsed’ high-dose dexamethasone, specifically
when combined with lenalidomide.14 Corticosteroids combined with thalidomide greatly augmented the response;
however, this came at the cost of increased toxicity. Indeed,
the major impediment to the long-term use of thalidomide
and dexamethasone has been neuropathy that almost invariably occurs in all individuals receiving the combination.
The neuropathy does not resolve easily even with cessation
of the drugs. In addition, we, and subsequently others,
observed that the combination was associated with an
increased risk of thrombosis and sudden death.15,16 Reasoning that thalidomide may produce vascular injury, if it
is truly antiangiogenic, low-dose aspirin was inaugurated
by us and proved successful. This is notwithstanding the
reported lack of efficacy of aspirin in ‘slow flow’ venous
thrombosis, a frequently reported phenomenon with thalidomide-dexamethasone.17 Heparin and warfarin have also
been effective prophylactics for venous thrombosis in MM
therapy, but low-dose warfarin may not be adequate.18
As a natural sequence in testing, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) headed up a cooperative
group study pitting thalidomide and dexamethasone in a
randomized trial against dexamethasone alone in newly

diagnosed patients destined for ASCT.19 The combination is, in some ways, ideal because neither medicine is
myelosuppressive. The combination indeed proved superior to dexamethasone alone, producing statistically superior responses (72% vs 50%, respectively) but at a cost of
greater toxicity, primarily deep venous thrombosis (17%
vs 3%). Unfortunately, antithrombotic measures were not
used in the study. A long-term follow-up of this was
recently published and showed a significantly longer time
to progression (22.6 vs 6.5 months) for those randomized
to the thalidomide-containing arm.20
Stemming from the remarkable success of thalidomide, 2 novel agents, bortezomib and lenalidomide, followed in relatively rapid succession. Lenalidomide, a
second-generation IMiD (immunomodulatory drug)
derived from and reportedly up to 2000 times more potent
in vitro than thalidomide in its IMiD-specific activity, was
introduced for clinical use in 2006.21 Again, treatment was
first tried in previously treated patients with recurrent or refractory disease. As with thalidomide, a minority of
patients, approximately 25%, responded to lenalidomide
monotherapy.22 Two concurrent randomized studies (1 in
Canada and the US and 1 in Europe, Australia, and Israel)
tested lenalidomide and dexamethasone against dexamethasone in previously treated patients.23,24 Combined dexamethasone and lenalidomide was superior and produced
responses, as with thalidomide, in 60% of patients compared with 20% to 25% of patients treated with dexamethasone alone. Once data of the combination’s efficacy were
established in previously treated patients, newly diagnosed
patients were studied. In treatment-naive patients with
MM, partial responses and better were achieved in 90% of
patients.25 Moreover, depending on the nuances of the
combination (such as the addition of clarithromycin or the
use of weekly dexamethasone) or response criteria used (ie,
strict complete remissions [sCR], complete remissions
[CR], near-complete responses [nCR], or very good partial
responses [VGPR] [all connoting at least a >90% reduction in immunoglobulin]), up to 40% of patients had a
nearly complete reduction of the M-spike.26 These results
represented a significant achievement because responses of
this magnitude were rarely noted with conventional chemotherapy, and were equal to or superior to transplantation.
Data suggest that these major responses may translate into
enhanced survival.27 Of note, ongoing studies are currently
testing whether a survival advantage of combination

lenalidomide plus dexamethasone will in fact be seen when
used for treatment-naive MM. Remarkably, thrombosis
was less problematic with the prophylactic use of antithrombotic agents in the above studies; however, thrombosis
was noted when the antithrombotic agent and lenalidomide were discontinued simultaneously. Apparently, any
putative damage to the endothelium is more long-standing
that the antithrombotic effects of aspirin, for instance,
which usually abates in approximately 10 days.17
Bortezomib, another novel agent, entered the market in 2003 with a mechanism of action believed to be
entirely different from the IMiDs. The major activity of
bortezomib is inhibition of proteasome activity. As a consequence of this inhibition, it has been postulated that
NF-kappa B activity is reduced. NF-kappa B is thought of
as a molecular signal with many nefarious activities once it
enters the nucleus, such as propagation of the inflammatory response, augmenting leukocyte proliferation signals,
and inducing cell adhesion molecule expression, among
other mechanisms.28,29 Similar to the results with thalidomide and lenalidomide, responses in previously treated
patients hovered around a third.30 The addition of steroids clearly enhanced the efficacy of bortezomib. When
used in previously untreated patients, with augmentation
as necessary by corticosteroids, responses similar to the
90% clinical response rate with IMiDs were obtained.31,32
In a large randomized study (APEX trial), bortezomib
tested against dexamethasone was clearly superior; recent
updated long-term follow-up demonstrated a 6-month
enhancement in survival with the novel agent.33 There
are some key differences between bortezomib and the
IMiDs. Bortezomib, like thalidomide, produces a peripheral neuropathy, although the neuropathy is more
rapidly reversible with bortezomib if the drug dosage is
reduced or held in a timely fashion.34 Similar to lenalidomide, there is some myelosuppression with bortezomib,
particularly thrombocytopenia; however, bortezomibinduced cytopenias are transitory, self-limited, and reversible. Lenalidomide tends to cause more sustained,
dose- and renal clearance-dependent cytopenias, prominently leukopenia.35,36 The IMiDs are taken orally, bortezomib is given by intravenous push. Bortezomib has
been shown to increase the risk of varicella zoster infection, with approximately 13% of patients developing
shingles as compared with 5% of patients treated with
dexamethasone alone.30 For this reason, HZV prophy238

laxis with acyclovir or similar agent in recommended
when using bortezomib.
Another important issue to consider is the impact of
the novel agents on stem cell mobilization and collection
in preparation for ASCT. Thalidomide, when used as
induction therapy for MM, has no known deleterious
effect on stem cell collection or the efficacy of the
ASCT.19,37 By contrast, lenalidomide use beyond a period
of 6 months has been shown to have a negative impact
on the mobilization of stem cells and has led to collection failures, especially when the mobilization regimen
consists of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) alone.38,39 Our group confirmed this finding and
has shown that a successful collection can be achieved
with the use of cyclophosphamide in addition to GCSF, independent of the duration of lenalidomide therapy.40 Bortezomib appears thus far to not interfere with
the ability to mobilize sufficient stem cells or perform
successful ASCT.41 Interestingly, bortezomib appears to
promote greater stem cell collection yields when used
just before G-CSF mobilization.42 Further work needs
to be done to confirm this finding, but if true this may
represent an exciting new method to enhance stem collections in MM patients who may have been heavily
pretreated with chemotherapy or otherwise would have
historically been ‘poor mobilizers.’
Given the different mechanisms of action, novel
agents have already been combined, but because of overlapping toxicity, doses may require attenuation. For
instance, thalidomide has been combined with bortezomib but suffers from overlapping neurologic toxicity.43
Bortezomib and lenalidomide are also being combined,
but do have some overlapping hematologic toxicity.44,45
Results presented in abstract form indicate that in the
upfront treatment setting, the response to the combination of bortezomib and IMiDs is approximately 90%,
much like the response seen with 1 of these agents alone
plus corticosteroid. Excitingly, the preliminary responses
to combinations of the IMiDs with bortezomib in the
recurrent/refractory MM setting looks remarkably impressive, with an overall 80% response rate reported in 1
study.45 One-third of the patients in the study receiving
lenalidomide plus bortezomib achieved a M-protein
reduction (VGPR) of >90%. Considering that this study
included patients who had progressed on prior singleagent lenalidomide, bortezomib, thalidomide, and

ASCT, these results are especially promising. A thalidomide and lenalidomide combination represents yet
another possibility because of the relative lack of overlapping toxicity. Whether such a combination will have an
additive or synergistic impact remains to be seen, because
there are only minimal data to indicate that resistance to 1
will not impart resistance to the other. Now that doses
have been finalized, it is only a matter of time before
mature results of the various combinations will be forthcoming in both treated and newly diagnosed patients.
The group in Los Angeles, as well as the Europeans,
the Italians and French in particular, took a different tack.
They combined novel agents with chemotherapy and
showed enhanced efficacy to chemotherapy alone. The
Italians demonstrated that in elderly patients, who were
not considered to be candidates for ASCT, the combination of thalidomide with traditional melphalan and prednisone treatment (MPT) was shown to be superior to MP,
with increases in both disease response rate (76% vs
47.6%) and overall survival at 3 years (80% vs 64%).46
The French have shown that in newly diagnosed elderly
MPT was superior to both MP and reduced intensity tandem ASCT.47 Other studies have shown that combinations of lenalidomide and/or bortezomib with melphalan
plus corticosteroid are highly active and tolerable regimens
for patients who could not normally proceed to
ASCT.48,49 The combination of bortezomib, oral cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (Cybor-D) produced a
remarkable 1-year progression-free survival of 83%.50
Meanwhile, the group formerly at the Cleveland Clinic
demonstrated that pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was
effective in MM despite what appears to be marginal activity of standard doxorubicin.51 The group in North Carolina, having done pioneering work with bortezomib,
noted excellent results combining bortezomib with liposomal doxorubicin.52 It is apparent that combinations of
novel agents with themselves, steroids, and/or chemotherapy are superior to a novel agent, steroids, or chemotherapy alone and most likely represent true synergism.
A question often posed is which novel agent is superior and which should initially be used. In the selection
process, a reasonable basis for the choice of an agent
should be the necessities presented by the patient. Does
the patient have a thrombotic tendency, renal failure, a
poor prognostic FISH abnormality, a venous access problem, a neuropathy, or limited bone marrow

reserve?17,35,53 In each of the aforementioned presentations, 1 novel agent over the other would be selected
depending on the expected side effect profile (tolerability)
of the chosen regimen. The lack of randomized clinical
trials pitting 1 novel therapy versus another, or against
ASCT, makes it difficult to point to any 1 agent, regimen,
or modality as reigning supreme.
These novel agents and their combinations have produced responses only achieved in the past by high-dose
chemotherapy. Evaluating these responses to treatment in
MM is challenging. Clinical responses have progressed to
the point that normalization of bone marrow immunohistochemistry and the serum free light chain ratio occurs with
regularity. MM response criteria have evolved in turn, first
by the European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow
Transplantation (EBMTR) and more recently by the International Uniform Response Criteria (IURC).54,55 Whether
the achievement of complete and stringent complete remissions translate into clinical benefit is a thorny debate, with
some studies demonstrating that there is no clear survival
benefit in achieving more than a very good partial remission (>90% reduction in M-protein) and others asserting
that complete remission is a relevant goal.56-60 This debate
has taken several dimensions, including methodologic,
clinical, and biologic. Methodologically, it was argued that
more robust responses did not translate into longer diseasefree intervals or progression-free survival (PFS). Indeed, it
is now recognized that the EBMTR criteria may have
penalized the PFS of patients achieving CR by virtue of the
low bar recommended to define progression of disease;
namely, transforming from an immunofixation (IFX)-negative state to an IFX-positive one. In contrast to surpassing
this highly sensitive measure, patients achieving a lesser
response (ie, PR, VGPR) required a sustained rise of
>25% of the tumor marker nadir for disease progression,
therefore prolonging the PFS.61,62 Broad use of the IURC
and improvement in the detection minimal residual disease
will certainly resolve this issue.63,64 Clinically, we and
others have identified that with the use of effective therapies
such as bortezomib, lenalidomide, or high-dose chemotherapy, CR will translate into improved clinical benefit in
the forms of time to alternative therapy and treatment-free
intervals more readily that any other response category.65
There is also the hint that we may be reaching the threshold
of MM plasma cell reduction as more CRs are achieved
and should begin to focus on treatment of the proposed

MM stem cell, which may be more sensitive to some therapies more than others.66
Nevertheless, ongoing efforts continue to discover a
curative therapy for MM, similar to that for large-cell lymphoma. Newer regimens, developed from the paradigms of
alternating or consolidative blocks of treatment of GoldieColdman and Norton-Simon, have been the foundation
for this movement.67,68 Total therapy and its evolution
through the years, developed by the group at the University
of Arkansas, thus far represents the best example moving
forward in this therapeutic direction with its use of alternating agents and dose-dense therapy with noticeable
improvements in overall survival.69,70 Long-term survivors
have been reported using such regimens in a group of
highly selected and motivated patients, but widespread
clinical benefit has yet to be proven. Notwithstanding the
above controversies, it is apparent that the novel agents
(alone and in combination with conventional therapies) are
effective agents and their use is already translating into
superior survival rates for MM.70
Only several groups of institutions, countries, and
studies have been mentioned, but to be certain there have
been many other institutions throughout the world and
many other pertinent studies that have contributed to our
better understanding of these remarkable new agents.
Indeed, there is now a bewildering array of trials combining
and using novel agents with themselves, steroids, and chemotherapy, and many other new agents are rapidly coming
down the pike. It is an exciting time in MM therapy.
