ABSTRACT
Cancer stem-like cell (CS-like cell) is considered to be responsible for recurrence
and drug resistance events in breast cancer, which makes it a potential target for
novel cancer therapeutic strategy. The FDA approved flubendazole, has been widely
used in the treatment of intestinal parasites. Here, we demonstrated a novel effect
of flubendazole on breast CS-like cells. Flubendazole inhibited breast cancer cells
proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manner and delayed tumor growth in
xenograft models by intraperitoneal injection. Importantly, flubendazole reduced
CD44high/CD24low subpopulation and suppressed the formation of mammosphere and
the expression of self-renewal related genes including c-myc, oct4, sox2, nanog
and cyclinD1. Moreover, we found that flubendazole induced cell differentiation
and inhibited cell migration. Consistently, flubendazole reduced mesenchymal
markers (β-catenin, N-cadherin and Vimentin) expression and induced epithelial and
differentiation marker (Keratin 18) expression in breast cancer cells. Mechanism
study revealed that flubendazole arrested cell cycle at G2/M phase and induced
monopolar spindle formation through inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Furthermore,
flubendazole enhanced cytotoxic activity of conventional therapeutic drugs fluorouracil
and doxorubicin against breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our findings uncovered
a remarkable effect of flubendazole on suppressing breast CS-like cells, indicating a
novel utilization of flubendazole in breast cancer therapy.

cancer patients [2-4], recurrence and metastasis are still
inevitable. CS-like cells (also known as stemloids) attract
much more attention owing to their contribution to therapy

of biomarkers such as CD44high/CD24low and aldehyde
dehydrogenase1 (ALDH1) [8, 9]. Activated signaling
pathways such as Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt/β-catenin, and
Notch play key roles in the regulation of self-renewal and
differentiation in breast CS-like cells [10].
Breast CS-like cells are enriched by chemotherapy
and radiotherapy, indicating therapy resistance of CS-like
cells [6, 7]. Chemotherapy drugs including doxorubicin
and cyclophosphamide increase the percentage of
CD44high/CD24low population and the formation of
mammosphere in residual tumors [6]. Moreover,
breast CS-like cells acquire resistance to radiation by
producing low level of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and phosphorylated H2AX [7]. Activation of Notch-1
signaling pathway is considered to be responsible for
radiotherapeutic resistance of CS-like cells [7].
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key
process during cancer metastasis. Breast CS-like cells
display EMT phenotype by loss of adhesion protein
E-cadherin and increased expression of fibronectin
and Vimentin, indicating that EMT is involved in
the regulation of CS-like cell properties [5]. Ectopic
expression of Twist or Snail induces EMT phenotype in
human mammary epithelial cells [5]. Interestingly, the
induction of EMT leads to CD44high/CD24low population
enrichment and mammosphere formation [5] by H-Ras
activation [11]. Besides, the expression of CS-like cell
markers including CD44high/CD24low, ALDH1, CD44v6
and ABCG2, contributes to tumor local recurrence and
poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients [8, 12, 13].
Therefore, strategies targeting CS-like cells provide great
promise for preventing therapy resistance, metastasis, and
recurrence in breast cancer.
CS-like cells are proposed to be a distinguished subgroup of proliferating cells concomitant with activating
self-renewal capability [14, 15]. Thus, CS-like cells show
proliferating ability different from that for cancer stem
cells (CSCs). Recent studies have shown that cell cycle
machinery was involved in the regulation of cancer stemlike cell capabilities [16-18]. For instance, depletion of
the CS-like cell marker USP22 arrests cell cycle at G1
phase in lung cancer cells [16]. Moreover, ectopic miR34a expression induces cell cycle blockage and inhibits
clonogenic expansion and tumor development by targeting
CD44 in prostate CS-like cells [17, 18]. Consistently,
silence of cell cycle protein Aurora-A suppresses
OCT4 and NANOG expression coupled with cell cycle
blockage at G2/M phase in ESCs [19, 20]. Therefore, the
modulation of cell cycle progression may open an avenue
for targeting CS-like cells.
Flubendazole, a member of benzimidazole families,
has the typical benzimidazole moiety but with an added
fluorine atom as the major structure, which makes it
different from other benzimidazoles [21]. Flubendazole is
widely used as a safe and efficacious anthelmintic drug
for gastrointestinal parasites control in human, rodents and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ruminants [21-25]. It disrupts tubulin polymerization by
showing preference for binding to nematode tubulin rather
than the tubulin in host [26, 27]. Recent studies report
that flubendazole has additional function in inhibiting
cell growth in leukemia and intestinal cancer [28, 29].
Flubendazole suppresses cell proliferation in vitro,
delays tumor formation in xenograft models and displays
preclinical activity by inhibiting tubulin polymerization
in leukemia and lymphoma [29]. Notably, vinblastine
resistant cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein are
sensitized to flubendazole, suggesting that flubendazole is
able to overcome vinblastine resistance in leukemia and
lymphoma [29].
In the present study, we demonstrated that
flubendazole, a FDA-approved anthelmintic drug,
inhibited cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo
at clinically tolerable concentration. We showed that
flubendazole targeted breast CS-like cells through
disrupting cell cycle progression. Moreover, flubendazole
suppressed cell migration, induced cell differentiation and
enhanced conventional chemotherapeutic efficiency in
breast cancer cells. These new data suggested the potential
utilization of flubendazole in breast cancer treatment by
targeting CS-like cells.

RESULTS
Flubendazole inhibits cell proliferation in human
breast cancer cells
The chemical structure of flubendazole was depicted
in Fig. 1A. To identify the cytotoxic effect of flubendazole
in breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231, BT-549, MCF-7 and
SK-BR-3 cells were treated with increasing concentration
of flubendazole (from 0 to 8μM) for 24, 48 and 72 hr,
respectively. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay.
Results showed that flubendazole significantly reduced
cell viability in breast cancer cells (Fig. S1A-D). The 50%
inhibitory concentration (IC50) measured by sigmoidal
curve fitting in MDA-MB-231, BT-549, MCF-7 and SKBR-3 cells were 1.75 ± 1.27, 0.72 ± 1.18, 5.51 ± 1.28 and
1.51 ± 1.25 μM, respectively (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the
significant inhibition of cell proliferation in both doseand time-dependent manners in MDA-MB-231, BT-549,
MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells was confirmed by cell counting
assay (Fig. 1C-F). Flubendazole inhibited cell proliferation
in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells, while
a severe cytotoxic effect was observed in BT-549 cells.
These data indicated that flubendazole played diverse roles
in breast cancer cells.

Flubendazole delays tumor growth in xenograft
model

in control group (792.03 ± 105.83 mm3), (Fig. 2A-B).
Consistently, tumor weight in flubendazole treated group
(0.24 ± 0.12 g, p=0.033) was lower than that in control
group (0.6 ± 0.31 g), (Fig. 2C). These findings indicated
that tumor growth in xenograft model was significantly
suppressed by flubendazole. Importantly, mice in
flubendazole treated group showed no obvious difference
in body weight compared to control group (Fig. 2D). In
addition, mouse behavior, feeding pattern and overall
activity did not show significant changes. These results
thus indicated that flubendazole inhibited tumorigenicity
efficiently in xenograft model with favorable toxicology
profiles.

As flubendazole displayed anti-proliferation activity
on malignant breast cancer cells in vitro, we further
evaluated whether flubendazole inhibited tumorigenicity in
vivo by using a xenograft tumor model. We subcutaneously
inoculated MDA-MB-231 cells into the right flank of nude
mice. When the tumors developed for 7 days (~100 mm3),
mice were randomized to receive flubendazole (20 mg/kg,
once daily) or vehicle control intraperitoneally. After 16
days of treatment, tumors in flubendazole treated group
(357.97 ± 37.3 mm3, p=0.0036) were smaller than that

Flubendazole reduces CS-like cell properties in
breast cancer cells

We subsequently tested whether flubendazole
inhibited anchorage-independent spheres formation.
MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to indicated
doses of flubendazole (0, 0.125 and 0.25 μM) for 7
days. Representative results were shown in Fig. 3C.
Flubendazole significantly reduced the number (>60
μm) and size of mammospheres (Fig. 3D-E). Similar
results were also observed in BT-549 cells (Fig. 3F-H).
Furthermore, flubendazole decreased the expression of
self-renewal genes such as c-myc, oct4, sox2, nanog and
cyclinD1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3I). Collectively,
these data displayed that flubendazole dramatically
reduced CS-like cell properties in breast cancer cells.
We previously demonstrated that epirubicinresistant MCF-7 cells (epi-MCF-7) were enriched with
CD44high/CD24low population together with an increased
expression of self-renewal related genes including
β-catenin, c-myc, sox2, oct4 and nanog compared with
wild-type MCF-7 cells [30]. We confirmed that epi-

To identify whether flubendazole inhibits breast
cancer stem-like cells, we performed flow cytometry
analysis to analyze the proportion of CS-like cell
subpopulation in breast cancer cells based on the
expression of CD44 and CD24 (CD44high/CD24low
configuration). As shown in Fig. 3A, MDA-MB-231
cells were enriched with CD44high/CD24low fraction
(~80%). After 2 days of flubendazole (0, 0.125 and 0.25
μM) treatment, CD44high/CD24low population in MDAMB-231 cells was dramatically reduced from 81.97
± 3.62% to 72.43 ± 1.98% and 44.07 ± 5.20% with
increasing flubendazole concentration (from 0 to 0.25 μM,
p<0.05) (Fig. 3B). This finding raised the possibility that
flubendazole might inhibit CS-like cell capability in breast
cancer cells.

MCF-7 had approximately 64% of CD44high/CD24low
subpopulation (Fig. S2A, right panel), while only as few
as 0.1% of CD44high/CD24low population was maintained in
MCF-7 cells (Fig. S2A, left panel). MTT and cell counting
assays were performed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of
flubendazole in both MCF-7 and epi-MCF-7 cells. Results
showed that flubendazole inhibited cell viability and
proliferation more efficiently in epi-MCF-7 cells than that
in MCF-7 cells (Fig. S2B-C). Moreover, the percentage
of CD44high/CD24low population was dramatically reduced
by 25% with flubendazole treatment in epi-MCF-7 cells
(Fig. S2D). Taken together, these results indicated that
flubendazole was preferably toxic to CS-like cells.

staining in CS-like cell enriched MDA-MB-231 cells
before and after flubendazole treatment (0.125 μM, 3
weeks) [31]. We observed that flubendazole dramatically
increased positively staining cells (p<0.05) (Fig. 4A-B).
Flubendazole treated MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited the
downregulation of Vimentin and upregulation of Keratin
18 (Fig. 4E-F), indicating that flubendazole induced
differentiation of breast cancer cells. Consistently, the
percentage of CD44high/CD24low population in MDAMB-231 cells was reduced by 20% after treatment with
flubendazole (Fig. S3A-B). These findings suggested that
flubendazole might reduce CS-like cells through inducing
cellular differentiation of breast cancer cells.
We then performed transwell assay to investigate the
migration ability of those treated (0.125 μM, 3 weeks) or
untreated MDA-MB-231 cells. Cell migration ability was
crippled significantly by flubendazole from control group
(580 ± 91.65 counts) to treated group (320 ± 45.82 counts,
p=0.023) (Fig. 4C-D). Western blot assay showed that

and Vimentin were reduced by flubendazole (Fig. 4E).
In contrast, epithelial marker Keratin 18 was elevated
remarkably (Fig. 4E). Moreover, flubendazole reduced
Vimentin and increased Keratin 18 expression showed by
immunofluorescence (IF) assay (Fig. 4F). These results
demonstrated that flubendazole inhibited cell migration
and reversed EMT phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells.

To determine whether flubendazole inhibits tubulin
polymerization, the spindle morphology was examined
by IF assay. After 24 hr of treatment with 0.25 μΜ

was stained with DAPI (blue). Morphological changes were observed under fluorescence microscopy (40×). (B) Graphs were statistically

The extracts were subjected to western blot analysis for α-tubulin and GAPDH expression analysis. The quantification of blot density was
shown in the figure. (D) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 0, 0.25, and 0.5 μM flubendazole for 24 hr, respectively. Cells were fixed

morphology was analyzed in Fig. 5A. The percentage of
monopolar spindle was significantly increased from 1.03
± 1.42% to 20.9 ± 6.92% (p=0.0025) with flubendazole
treatment (Fig. 5B). Consistent results were observed
in BT-549 cells (Fig. S4A-B). We further examined the
effect of flubendazole against tubulin polymerization.
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with nocodazole
(destabilizer of microtubule), flubendazole and taxol
(stabilizer of microtubule) for 24 hr, respectively. The
cells then were lysed and fractionated from cytosolic
(supernatant, S) to cytoskeletal (pellet, P) extracts. The

extracts were subjected to western blot assay. As shown in
Fig. 5C, flubendazole suppressed tubulin polymerization
similar with nocodazole treatment, while taxol accelerated
tubulin polymerization. Similar results were observed
in BT-549 cells (Fig. S4C). Thus, flubendazole induced
monopolar spindle formation through inhibiting tubulin
polymerization.
We also studied whether flubendazole blocked cell
cycle progression in breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with 0, 0.25 and 0.5 μΜ flubendazole
for 24 hr and then subjected to cell cycle profile analysis
by flow cytometer. The percentage of G0/G1 (2N) phase

cells was decreased from 58.31 ± 1.46% to 34.98 ± 3.97%
and 16.44 ± 2.85% with the increasing flubendazole
concentration (from 0 to 0.5 μM), (Fig. 5D-E). In
contrast, the percentage of cells with 4N DNA content was
increased from 25.49 ± 1.91% to 42.93 ± 3.65% and 55.55
± 3.99% (Fig. 5D-E). The same phenomenon was also
observed in BT-549 cells (Fig. S4D-E). Moreover, cell
cycle markers were identified by western blot. In response
to flubendazole treatment, both MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells showed increased phosphorylation of cdc2 at
threonine 161 and decreased phosphorylation at tyrosine
15. These results indicated continuous cdc2 activation
resulted from mitotic arrest. The increased expression of
cyclinB1 and decreased expression of cyclinE suggested
a G2/M arrest by flubendazole treatment (Fig. 5F and
Fig. S4F). Taken together, these data demonstrated that
flubendazole arrested cell cycle at G2/M phase through
inhibiting tubulin polymerization.

reduced breast CS-like cells evidenced by loss of CD44high/
CD24low population, reduction of mammospheres and the
suppressed expression of stem cell related genes (c-myc,
oct4, sox2, nanog and cyclinD1); (3) flubendazole induced
cell differentiation, decreased cell migration and overcame
drug resistance in breast cancer cells; (4) mechanistically,
flubendazole induced monopolar spindle formation by
inhibiting tubulin polymerization followed by cell cycle
blockage at G2/M phase in breast cancer cells. These new
findings implied that the conventional anthelmintic drug
flubendazole could be applied as a novel anti-cancer agent
for breast cancer therapy by targeting CS-like cells.
Recent studies report that the first-line drugs
for treating other disease might be repurposed for
targeting CS-like cells in breast cancer [32-35]. For
instance, metformin, a hypoglycemic drug, reduced the
incidence of various cancers in diabetic patients [32,
33]. Metformin suppressed tumor growth in xenografts
by preferentially inhibiting nuclear translocation of NFκB and phosphorylation of STAT3 in cancer stem cells
[34]. All-trans retinoic acid, another first-line drug for
leukemia, suppressed the mammosphere-forming ability
which was correlated with the reduced expression of
SOX2 and elevated expression of its antagonist CDX2 in
breast CS-like cells [35].  The FDA approved flubendazole
is extensively used as an efficacious anthelmintic drug
in gastrointestinal parasites disease [21-23]. Here, we
demonstrated that flubendazole significantly reduced
CD44high/CD24low population (Fig. 3A), sphere formation
(Fig. 3C) and stem cell related genes (c-myc, oct4,
sox2, nanog and cyclinD1) expression (Fig. 3I). Thus,
flubendazole could be repurposed as a novel agent for
targeting CS-like cells in breast cancer therapy.
Chemoresistance is a major obstacle to successful
treatment of cancer. CSCs are considered to be resistant
to chemotherapy due to their expressing drug pumps
(ABC transporters) [36, 37]. Similarly, cancer stemlike cells could acquire drug transporters rendering cells
chemoresistance [38, 39]. Therefore, strategies targeting
breast CS-like cells might overcome chemotherapy
resistance. For instance, Aurora-A inhibitor AKI603
combined with epirubicin significantly eliminates the
tumor initiating cells and overcomes drug resistance
in breast cancer [30]. Here, we demonstrated that
flubendazole enhanced cytotoxic activity of fluorouracil
and doxorubicin by targeting breast CS-like cells (Fig.
6). Strikingly, epirubicin resistant breast cancer cells that
had an accumulation of CD44high/CD24low population
were sensitized to flubendazole (Fig. S2). Taken together,
flubendazole could overcome chemoresistance and
enhance the efficiency of conventional therapy. Thus,
Flubendazole displayed potential advantages in clinical
application for supplementing the shortage of conventional
therapy.
Both cancer stem-like cell properties and EMT
contribute to lung and liver metastasis in breast and

Flubendazole enhances the cytotoxic activity of
fluorouracil and doxorubicin in breast cancer cells
We further investigated whether flubendazole
enhanced the cytotoxicity of conventional chemotherapy
drugs such as fluorouracil and doxorubicin. MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with increasing concentration of
fluorouracil (from 0 to 5 μg/ml) or doxorubicin (from 0 to
0.03 μM) with or without flubendazole. Cell viability was
measured by MTT assay after 72 hr of incubation (Fig.
6A-B). Flubendazole treatment enhanced significantly the
cytotoxic effect of fluorouracil and doxorubicin in breast
cancer cells. The same results were observed in BT-549
cells (Fig. S5A-B).
To gain further evidence about the synergic effects
of flubendazole and conventional chemotherapy drugs,
colony formation assay was performed. As shown in Fig.
6C-D (a), fluorouracil (0.5 μg/ml), doxorubicin (0.01 μM)
or flubendazole (0.125 μM) alone only partially reduced
the colony formation. While conventional chemotherapy
drugs (fluorouracil or doxorubicin) combined with
flubendazole significantly inhibited the colony formation
ability in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 6C-D). Consistent
results were shown in BT-549 cells (Fig. S5C-D).
Taken together, flubendazole enhanced conventional
chemotherapy drugs (fluorouracil or doxorubicin)
efficiency, indicating flubendazole might function as a
potential anti-cancer agent in combination therapy.

DISCUSSION
Our data provided evidences for the application of
flubendazole as anti-CS-like cells agent for breast cancer
therapy by revealing several findings: (1) flubendazole
inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and
suppressed tumor growth in vivo; (2) flubendazole

MATERIALS AND METHODS

colorectal cancer [40, 41]. Peptides (P17 and P144)
targeting EMT also inhibit the expression of CD44 and
SOX2 [41]. Keratin 18 is considered as a differentiation
and epithelial marker, indicating differentiation and
mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) of breast
cancer cells [42, 43], while Vimentin functions as a
dedifferentiation and mesenchymal marker in breast
cancer cells [44, 45]. In the present study, we found that
flubendazole treated MDA-MB-231 cells expressed high
level of Keratin 18 and low level of β-catenin, N-cadherin
and Vimentin (Fig. 4E-F), indicative of cell differentiation
and EMT reversion. Meanwhile, the migration ability
was crippled significantly by flubendazole (Fig. 4C-D).
Therefore, flubendazole might be a hopeful candidate in
breast cancer treatment.
The mechanism of flubendazole suppressing CSlike cells is not fully understood. Since CS-like cells
are proliferating and actively cycling [14, 15], cell cycle
blockage might affect the CS-like cell properties. Here,
we reported that flubendazole arrested cell cycle at G2/M
phase through interfering tubulin-microtubule equilibrium
(Fig. 5 and Fig. S4). Mechanistically, these data suggested
that breast CS-like cell capability was suppressed by
the blockage of cell cycle progression. Thus, these new
findings open an avenue for targeting CS-like cells through
blocking cell cycle progression.
Flubendazole has been extensively studied for
antihelmintic use in animal and humans with favorable
toxicology profiles [22, 25, 46]. Consistently, our data
displayed that flubendazole treatment (25 mg/kg, daily)
did not alter gaining weight of nude mice during the
experiment compared with the control group (Fig. 2D),
indicating low toxicity to the mice. However, poor
absorption is still a challenge for clinical application of
flubendazole [29]. Flubendazole produces low plasma
concentrations in hosts due to its high lipophilicity
[22, 24]. Recent studies report that solid dispersion
technique and emulsion cross-linking volatile technique
are utilized to enhance the bioavalibility of albendazole
that has the similar absorption properties and structure
with flubendazole [47-49]. These methods for improving
bioavalibility shed lights on the application of flubendazole
in the clinical test.
In summary, we demonstrated that flubendazole,
the FDA approved drug, exhibited a potential role in
suppressing CS-like cells, inducing cell differentiation
and reducing cell migration in poorly differentiated
breast cancer cells. We also revealed a mechanism that
flubendazole targeted breast CS-like cells through
blocking cell cycle progression. Considering the safety
profile and efficacy of flubendazole, our preclinical data
rendered flubendazole as a viable therapeutic strategy for
the treatment of breast cancer.

Reagents
Flubendazole was offered by Yang group at Dalian
University of Technology. Taxol was purchased from
Sigma. Fluorouracil was purchased from Shanghai Sangon
Company. Doxorubicin was purchased from Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology. Flubendazole was prepared in
DMSO. Others were prepared in filtered dH2O.

Cell culture
The human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231,
BT-549, SK-BR-3 and MCF-7) were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The epiMCF-7 cell line was obtained from professor Lam
(Imperial College London UK, London, United Kingdom)
and was previously described [50]. MDA-MB-231, SKBR-3, MCF-7 and epi-MCF-7 cell lines were maintained
in Dulbecco`s modified Eagle`s medium (DMEM,
Invitrogen Corp) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Invitrogen Corp). BT-549 cell line was maintained
in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen Corp) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Corp). All cells were
incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing
5% CO2.

MTT assay and proliferation assay
MDA-MB-231, BT-549, SK-BR-3 and MCF-7
cells were seeded in 96-well microplates and cultured
with various doses of flubendazole for 24, 48 and 72 hr,
respectively. MTT solution (5 mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) was
added to cells and incubated for another 3 hr at 37 °C.
The optical densities (OD) were measured at absorbance
570 nm. Cell proliferation was performed by cell counting
assay. We seeded the same amount of cells into 24-well
plate and counted for 3 continuous days monitoring the
cell growth.

Tumor growth in xenografts
MDA-MB-231 cells (2×106) were inoculated into
the right flank of 4~6 weeks old female nude mice (n=6),
all of which developed tumors in 7 days with size of ~100
mm3. The mice were randomly distributed into two groups
to receive 25 mg/kg flubendazole in 0.9% NaCl and 0.01%
Tween-80 or vehicle control (0.9% NaCl and 0.01%
Tween-80) once daily by intraperitoneal injection. Tumor
volume (a×b2/2; a represented the greatest diameter, b was
the diameter perpendicular to a) was measured by calipers
twice every week. Other indicators of general health such

as body weight, feeding behavior and motor activity of
each animal were also monitored. After administration
of flubendazole or vehicle for 16 days, the mice were
euthanized and the tumor xenografts were immediately
dissected, weighted, stored and fixed. Investigation has
been conducted in accordance with the ethical standards
and according to the Declaration of Helsinki and
according to national and international guidelines and has

committee of Dalian Medical University.

chamber. After incubated for 24 hr, cells that migrated
through the membrane were fixed with 70% ethanol
and stained with 0.4% crystal violet (Shanghai Sangon
Company). The stained cell images were captured by
microscope, and five random fields at 10× magnification
were counted. Results represented the average of triplicate
samples from three independent experiments [51].

Flow cytometry analysis

Cells were grown on glass cover lips in the presence
or absence of flubendazole for 24 hr. After fixed in 4%
(v/v) formaldehyde/PBS, Cells were permeabilized (0.5%
TritonX-100/PBS) and blocked for 1 hr in 5% BSA/PBS.
IF was performed at room temperature using Vimentin
(Merck Millipore, 1:200), Keratin 18 (Cell Signaling
Technology, 1:100), α-tubulin (Santa Cruz, 1:400) and
γ-tubulin (Sigma Aldrich, 1:800) antibodies. Alexaconjugated anti-IgG antibodies (Invitrogen Corp, 1:200)
were used for secondary detection. DAPI (Sigma Aldrich,
1 μg/ml) was used for nuclear staining. Images were
acquired using an Olympus microscope.

Immunofluorescence analysis

Cells exposed to indicated concentration of
flubendazole for 72 hr, were trypsinized, washed twice
with PBS by centrifugation (1,000 rpm, 5 min), and
blocked (0.5% BSA/PBS) for 10 min. Collected cells were
then incubated with anti-CD24 PE (eBioscience) and antiCD44 FITC (eBioscience) or isotype controls antibodies
according to manufacturer’s instructions for 30 min at
4 °C protected from light. Then, cells were suspended
in 1 ml PBS and subjected to flow cytometry analysis
(Beckman). Side-scatter and forward-scatter profiles were
used to eliminate cell doublets [51]. The statistical results
of three independent experiments were presented.

DNA content analysis
DNA content analysis was performed using
propidium iodide (PI) staining. Briefly, cells were seeded
in 6-cm dishes and treated with indicated concentration
of flubendazole for 24 hr. Both adherent cells and floating
cells were collected for analysis. The cells were fixed in
70% cold ethanol, stained with 1 mg/ml PI and analyzed
by FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
Fluorescence profiles represent the DNA content of the
PI stained cells.

Mammosphere formation assay
Dissociated single cells (1,000) were seeded in
6-well ultra-low attachment plates (Corning Costar). Cells
were cultured with serum-free DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen
Corp) supplemented with 20 ng/ml epithelial growth
factor (EGF, Sigma Aldrich), 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF, PeproTech) and B27 in the absence
and presence of flubendazole for 9 days. All spheres were
photographed by invert microscope (10×, Olympus). The
number and diameter of spheres were calculated by Image
pro plus 6.0 (Olympus).

In vivo tubulin polymerization and microtubule
disassembly assays
The separation of insoluble polymerized
microtubules from soluble tubulin dimmers were
performed as described previously [52]. In the study, cells
were treated with flubendazole (0.25 μM), nocodazole
(0.25 μM) and taxol (20 nM) for 24 hr, respectively. Then,
the floating mitotic cells were harvested. Equal numbers of
mitotic cells (3×106) were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C in 30 μl
lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 6.8), 1 mM
MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5% NP40, 2 mM PMSF and fresh
cocktail. Proteins in the supernatants (containing soluble
tubulin) were separated from pellets (containing insoluble
tubulin) by centrifugation (15,000g, 10 min). The pellets
were continuingly lysed in 30 μl of RIPA, and centrifuged
at 15,000g for 10 min. Then, the supernatant (insoluble
tubulin) were collected. Equal amounts of soluble and
insoluble samples were subjected to western blot analysis.

Oil Red O staining
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 0.125 μΜ
flubendazole or vehicle control for 3 weeks. Oil-Red-O
staining for the detection of lipid droplets was performed
as previously described [31]. Images were obtained under
microscope.

Migration assay
For the migration assay, 5,000 cells with or without
indicated concentration of flubendazole were seeded on
the matrigel coated Membrane in the upper chamber (24well insert, 8 μm, Corning Costar). DMEM supplemented
with 20% serum was used as an attractant in the lower
