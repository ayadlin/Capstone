Abstract
Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, CDDP) is one of the
most used drugs for osteosarcoma chemotherapy. By using a
series of CDDP-resistant variants, which were established from
the U-2OS and Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cell lines, we
found that CDDP resistance was mainly associated with the
increase of both the intracellular level and enzymatic activity
of glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1). On the basis of these
findings, we evaluated the clinical effect of GSTP1 in a series
of 34 high-grade osteosarcoma patients and we found that
the increased expression of GSTP1 gene was associated with
a significantly higher relapse rate and a worse clinical outcome. These indications prompted us to assess the in vitro
effectiveness of 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol
(NBDHEX), a promising new anticancer agent that is a highly
efficient inhibitor of GSTP1. NBDHEX was tested on a panel
of 10 human osteosarcoma cell lines and 20 variants of the
U-2OS or Saos-2 cell lines that were resistant to CDDP, doxorubicin, or methotrexate. NBDHEX proved to be very active
on the vast majority of these cell lines, including those with
higher GSTP1 levels and enzymatic activity. Drug combination
studies showed that NBDHEX can be used in association
with CDDP and provided useful information about the best
modality of their combined administration. In conclusion, our
findings show that GSTP1 has a relevant effect for both CDDP
resistance and clinical outcome of high-grade osteosarcoma
and that targeting GSTP1 with NBDHEX may be considered a
promising new therapeutic possibility for osteosarcoma
patients who fail to respond to conventional chemotherapy.

Several mechanisms can be responsible for CDDP resistance,
including decreased drug accumulation, increased drug efflux,
increased detoxification by glutathione or metallothionein systems,
decreased DNA platination, or increased DNA repair (5, 6).
A key factor that severely limits the CDDP cytotoxic efficacy in
several human tumors is the activity of cellular glutathione (GSH)related detoxification system. In fact, once inside the cell, CDDP
has to be activated through a series of spontaneous aquation
reactions before being able to interact with DNA (6). The formation
of aquated CDDP is rate limited by its interaction with many
endogenous detoxification molecules, among which GSH is the
most important and effective (5). When CDDP enters cells and
is aquated, it becomes vulnerable to cytoplasmic inactivation by
GSH. The reaction with GSH is catalyzed by the glutathione
S-transferases (GST), a family of enzymes involved in xenobiotic
detoxification, the dominant member of which is the GSTP1-1
isoenzyme (7, 8).
Differently from other human tumors, the relative effect of these
mechanisms for the resistance to CDDP in human osteosarcoma
cells still remains to be determined, mostly because of the rarity of
adequate experimental models. In this study, we have investigated
the bases of CDDP resistance in a series of CDDP-resistant human
osteosarcoma cell lines. Moreover, because we have found that
the acquisition of CDDP resistance in our experimental models
mostly involved GSTP1-1 alterations, we evaluated the clinical
effect of GSTP1-1 expression in a series of high-grade osteosarcoma
patients, and we also assessed the in vitro effectiveness of 6-(7nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol (NBDHEX), a promising
new anticancer agent that is a highly efficient inhibitor of GSTP1-1
and can accumulate in tumor cells by avoiding the extrusion
mediated by multidrug resistance protein pumps (9–11).

Introduction
Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, CDDP) is a very active
antitumor agent that shows a relevant clinical activity against a
wide variety of human solid tumors. CDDP is widely used for highgrade osteosarcoma treatment, but despite this, only a small
amount of information about the mechanisms that are responsible
for resistance to this drug in human osteosarcoma cells has yet
been reported (1–4).
CDDP produces DNA damages by inducing DNA interstrand or
intrastrand cross-links, which finally drive cells to apoptosis (5).

Materials and Methods
Drugs. CDDP, doxorubicin (DX), and methotrexate (MTX) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. NBDHEX was synthetized as reported by
Ricci and colleagues (9). Stock solutions of CDDP (500 Ag/mL), DX (2 mg/
mL), and MTX (25 mg/mL) were stored at 4jC. NBDHEX was dissolved in
DMSO at a 50 mmol/L concentration and stock solution aliquots were
stored in darkness at room temperature. Immediately before use, the
integrity of NBDHEX molecule was verified by spectrophotometry. After
dilution of NBDHEX stock solutions to the appropriate concentration
required for the in vitro experiments, the final DMSO concentration never
exceeded 0.01%, a dosage at which DMSO had no cytotoxic effect on our cell
lines. For all drugs, working concentrations were prepared by diluting stock
solutions in culture medium immediately before use.
Cell lines. CDDP-resistant variants were established by exposing the
CDDP-sensitive U-2OS and Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cell lines [both
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] to step-bystep increases in CDDP concentrations. The in vitro continuous drug
exposure resulted in the establishment of variants that were resistant to

300 ng/mL CDDP (U-2OS/CDDP300 and Saos-2/CDDP300), 1 Ag/mL
(U-2OS/CDDP1 Ag and Saos-2/CDDP1 Ag), 4 Ag/mL (U-2OS/CDDP4 Ag),
or 6 Ag/mL CDDP (Saos-2/CDDP6 Ag). These drug concentrations corresponded to 1.0 Amol/L (300 ng/mL), 3.3 Amol/L (1 Ag/mL), 13.3 Amol/L
(4 Ag/mL), and 20.0 Amol/L CDDP (6 Ag/mL), respectively.
For the in vitro evaluation of NBDHEX effectiveness, in addition to
U-2OS, Saos-2, and their CDDP-resistant variants, a group of other 8 human
osteosarcoma cell lines and 14 drug-resistant variants were considered.
Among these, the human osteosarcoma cell lines MG-63 and HOS were
purchased from ATCC, whereas the IOR/OS9, IOR/OS10, IOR/OS14, IOR/
OS15, IOR/OS18, and SARG cell lines were established from clinical
specimens obtained from osteosarcoma patients at the Laboratorio di
Ricerca Oncologica of the Istituti Ortopedici Rizzoli (12). The six DXresistant and eight MTX-resistant variants included in this panel were
selected from the U-2OS and Saos-2 cell lines, as previously described
(13, 14). All cell lines were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium,
supplemented with penicillin (100 units/mL)/streptomycin (100 Ag/mL;
Invitrogen Ltd.) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker
Europe). Each drug-resistant variant was continuously cultured in the
presence of the drug concentration used for its selection. All cell lines were
maintained at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
In vitro growth characteristics and drug sensitivity analyses. The
in vitro growth characteristics (doubling time and saturation density) of
each cell line were determined as previously described (14, 15). Drug
sensitivities of each cell line were calculated from the drug dose-response
curves obtained by using a standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH)
and expressed as IC50 (drug concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of
cell growth after 96 hours of in vitro treatment).
Evaluation of drug-drug interactions. To evaluate the in vitro
interactions between NBDHEX and CDDP, human osteosarcoma cell lines
were incubated with different regimens of two-drug combinations. In the
experiments of simultaneous exposure, cell lines were treated with
combinations in which the two drugs were used at equitoxic concentrations, corresponding to dosages resulting in 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, and 60%
growth inhibitions (IC10, IC20, IC30, IC50, and IC60) after 96 hours of singledrug treatment. In the drug sequence experiments, cell lines were
sequentially exposed for 72 hours to equitoxic concentrations (IC10, IC20,
IC30, IC50, and IC60 after 72 hours of single-drug treatment) of NBDHEX and
then, after its removal, to the same equitoxic concentrations of CDDP for
additional 72 hours. The same schedule was repeated by exposing cells to
CDDP followed by NBDHEX. To define the type of interaction between
NBDHEX and CDDP (in terms of synergism, additivity, or antagonism),
the combination index of each two-drug treatment was calculated with the
isobologram equation (16) by using the CalcuSyn software (Biosoft). By
following the range of combination index values reported in the CalcuSyn
software manual and recommeded by Chou and colleagues (16), we
classified the drug-drug interaction as synergistic when combination index
< 0.90, as additive when 0.90 V combination index V 1.10, or as antagonistic
when combination index > 1.10.
Assessment of drug-induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation.
Drug-induced apoptosis was estimated on the basis of morphologic
assessment of apoptotic nuclei after nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258
(Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described (15). For DNA fragmentation
analysis, DNA of CDDP-untreated and treated cells was isolated by using the
Apoptotic DNA Ladder Kit (Roche) by following the manufacturer’s
procedure, and DNA samples were electrophoresed through 1.0% agarose
gel in the presence of ethidium bromide to reveal the DNA smears under
UV light.
Intracellular uptake of CDDP. The intracellular uptake of CDDP was
evaluated and quantified on both parental cell lines and CDDP-resistant
variants with the method reported by Molenaar and colleagues (17), which
is based on the use of a carboxyfluorescein diacetate–conjugated CDDP
(CFDA-Pt). The quantification of CFDA-Pt fluorescence intensity was done
by image cytometry with a fluorescence microscope equipped with a
Photometrics Sensys charge-coupled device camera (QUIPS XL Genetic
Workstations, Abbott-Vysis, Inc.).

GSH and GSTP1-1 assays. Intracellular GSH concentration was
estimated with the Bioxytech GSH-400 kit (OxisResearch) by following the
manufacturer’s procedure. The total protein concentration of each sample
was determined with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (SigmaAldrich) and GSH content was referred to as picomoles per milligram of
total proteins.
The GSTP1-specific activity was measured according to the method of
Habig and colleagues (18) by using ethacrynic acid, a GSTP1 class–specific
substrate (19). The reaction mixture ( final volume of 0.2 mL) used for these
assays contained 100 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5),
1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 6.5), 0.25 mmol/L glutathione, 0.2 mmol/L ethacrynic
acid, and 200 Ag of cellular proteins. The amount of ethacrynate-GSH
conjugates was measured by spectrophotometry with the Nanodrop ND1000 (Nanodrop Technologies, Inc.) at 270 nm. GSTP1 activity was defined
as the amount of enzyme that was able to catalyze the conjugation of
1 nmol of ethacrynic acid with GSH per minute at 25jC, and it was referred
to as the protein content of each sample. As for GSH assays, the protein
concentration of each sample was determined with the bicinchoninic acid
protein assay reagent (Sigma-Aldrich).
k-class GST, A-class GST, and a-class GST protein levels were estimated
by Western blot with the following primary antibodies: NCL-GSTpi (specific
for k-class GST; Novocastra Lab), anti-GSTM1 (specific for A-class GST),
or anti-GSTA1 (specific for a-class GST; both from Novus Biologicals). All
primary antibodies were diluted at 1:500 in TTBS/1% (w/v) nonfat milk. To
verify the protein loading of each sample, after stripping of the primary
antibody, the same membranes were immunostained with an anti–h-actin
monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International). For each band, the amount
of GST proteins was determined by densitometric analysis and normalized
to that of h-actin.
The expression level of the GSTP1 gene was analyzed by real-time PCR in
parental cell lines and CDDP-resistant variants and in 34 tumor biopsies
obtained from primary, nonmetastatic, high-grade osteosarcoma patients.
All these patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocols
based on the administration of DX, MTX, CDDP, and ifosfamide. Before RNA
extraction, all clinical samples were histologically examined for tissue
quality and representativity. Total RNA was extracted from both cell lines
and snap-frozen tumor tissue samples by using the standard method with
the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For each sample, 500 ng of total RNA were
reverse transcribed to cDNA in a 50 AL-reaction mixture using the High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time
PCR for GSTP1 gene was done by using the TaqMan Low Density Arrays
(Applied Biosystems) with predesigned TaqMan probe and primer sets.
Samples were analyzed with the ABI Prism 7900HT system with a TaqMan
LDA Upgrade (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The expression level of the GSTP1 gene was normalized to
that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the
relative quantification analysis was based on the DDC t method. A pooled
cDNA from human normal osteoblasts was used as calibrator for the
comparative analysis. Clinical cases were stratified into high-expressing
and low-expressing GSTP1 by using the median GSTP1 expression value as
cutoff.
Statistics. Differences among means were analyzed with the Student’s
t test. Two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate the statistical
association between two variables. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods
were used to draw and evaluate the significance of survival curves.

Results
Selection and characterization of CDDP-resistant variants.
CDDP-resistant variants of U-2OS and Saos-2 human osteosarcoma
cell lines were obtained by initially exposing parental cell lines to
300 ng/mL (1.0 Amol/L) CDDP until they achieved a growth rate
similar to that of untreated cells. Selection was then continued
by step-by-step increases in CDDP concentrations up to 4 Ag/mL
(13.3 Amol/L) for U-2OS variants or up to 6 Ag/mL (20.0 Amol/L)
for Saos-2 variants. Establishment of adequate in vitro growth at

each new CDDP concentration required f10 to 12 weeks
(corresponding to 8–10 in vitro passages). All the experiments
were done on CDDP-resistant variants that were maintained in
culture for at least 6 months (30–35 in vitro passages) after
establishment.
The CDDP IC50 values and the fold increase of resistance in the
CDDP-resistant variants are listed in Table 1. In particular, the
increase in CDDP resistance compared with the parental cell line
ranged from 4.0- to 62.5-fold for U-2OS variants and from 7.4- to
112.1-fold for Saos-2 variants. Overall, CDDP-resistant variants did
not show cross-resistance to DX or MTX, with the sole exception
being U-2OS/CDDP1 Ag, which was less sensitive to MTX, and
U-2OS/CDDP4 Ag, which showed a reduced sensitivity to DX and
MTX (Table 1).
The doubling time of all CDDP-resistant variants did not
significantly differ from those of their corresponding parental cell
lines, whereas saturation density significantly decreased in U-2OS/
CDDP1 Ag, U-2OS/CDDP4 Ag, and in Saos-2/CDDP6 Ag variants
(Supplementary Table S1).
To evaluate the sensitivity to CDDP-induced apoptosis, parental
cell lines and CDDP-resistant variants were treated with equitoxic
dosages of CDDP, corresponding to the IC50, 5-fold IC50, or 10-fold
IC50 concentration of each cell line. No significant difference was
found between CDDP-resistant variants and parental cell lines,
although variants seemed to be slightly more sensitive to CDDPinduced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S1). In agreement with the
apoptosis data, DNA fragmentation induced by treatment of cells
with the same CDDP concentrations did not show any significant
difference between parental cell lines and CDDP-resistant variants,
all of these showing a similar extent of DNA fragmentation in
CDDP-treated cells (data not shown).
Analysis of intracellular CDDP uptake showed that both parental
cell lines and CDDP-resistant variants incorporated CDDP in
almost all the cells. No difference was found about the intracellular
CDDP distribution because all cell lines presented both cytoplasmic and nuclear uptake of CDDP and similar intracellular amounts
of drug. Efflux cytometric analyses showed that both parental cell
lines and CDDP-resistant variants were able to completely extrude
CDDP from inside the cell with the same efficiency within 24 hours
after drug removal (data not shown). Taken together, these data

indicated that, in our experimental model, CDDP intracellular
accumulation and distribution changes were not involved in
development of CDDP resistance.
GSH and GSTP1-1 status in cell lines. Evaluation of the
intracellular GSH concentration did not reveal any remarkable
difference between CDDP-resistant variants and parental cell
lines, although the two variants with the highest levels of CDDP
resistance showed a trend toward an increase in GSH levels
(Supplementary Table S2). The intracellular GSH levels of CDDPresistant variants and parental cell lines were also inside the range
of GSH content found in the other human drug-sensitive and drugresistant osteosarcoma cell lines, which were included in the cell
line panel used for this study (Supplementary Table S2).
Analyses of GSTP1 gene expression and GST protein levels
and enzymatic activity were done in all drug-sensitive and drugresistant cell lines (data are summarized in Table 2). To compare
the GST isoenzyme status in the group of drug-sensitive, human
osteosarcoma cell lines, the U-2OS cell line was used as reference.
GSTP1 status varied among these cell lines, but in all of them there
was quite a good correlation between gene expression level, protein
expression, and enzymatic activity. In fact, the level of GSTP1specific enzymatic activity (assessed by using the ethacrynic acid as
substrate) proceeded parallel to the extent of the GSTP1 gene
expression, the GSTP1-1 protein level, or both of them in the vast
majority of cell lines (Table 2). In the group of drug-resistant
variants, the following additional considerations must be done.
Taking into account the parental cell line, the GSTP1-specific
enzymatic activity progressively increased in all CDDP-resistant
variants. However, whereas in U-2OS/CDDP-resistant variants the
higher GSTP1-1 enzymatic activity was associated with an increase
in both GSTP1-1 gene expression and protein level, in Saos-2/
CDDP-resistant variants the increased GSTP1-1 enzymatic activity
was not related to changes in gene expression and protein level
(Table 2). An increased GSTP1-specific enzymatic activity of at least
2-fold compared with parental cells was also found in the four
variants with the highest level of resistance to DX, in association
with higher GSTP1-1 gene and protein expression (Table 2). Similar
evidence was found for U-2OS/MTX30, U-2OS/MTX100, and
U-2OS/MTX300, in which the increased GSTP1-specific enzymatic
activity was associated with higher protein levels and enhanced

gene expression, with the only exception being U-2OS/MTX30
(Table 2). As a whole, these findings indicated that, in the osteosarcoma cell lines included in this panel, enhanced GSTP1-specific
enzymatic activity was very often associated with enhanced GSTP1
gene expression, increased GSTP1-1 protein level, or both of them,
as reported for many other human tumor cell lines (7).
Clinical effect of GSTP1 expression level. The clinical effect of
GSTP1 expression was analyzed in a series of 34 clinical samples
taken from patients with primary, nonmetastatic osteosarcoma,
whose clinicopathologic characteristics reflected those of conventional high-grade osteosarcoma (Supplementary Table S3). GSTP1
gene expression level was assessed and quantified by real-time PCR
and patients were classified into two subgroups by using as cutoff
value the median GSTP1 gene expression level of the whole series.
The range of GSTP1 expression level in clinical samples overlapped
that of our drug-sensitive, human osteosarcoma cell lines (data not
shown). A high expression of GSTP1 at diagnosis was found in 17 of
34 (50%) patients. No relationship was found between GSTP1 gene
expression level (high or low) and clinicopathologic variables
(gender, age, histologic subtype, type of surgery, surgical margins,
and tumor necrosis; Supplementary Table S3).
With regard to clinical outcome, 16 (47%) patients relapsed
and 18 (53%) patients did not show any evidence of disease.

Relapse was significantly associated with GSTP1 gene status,
occurring in 12 of 17 (71%) patients with high GSTP1 gene
expression and in 4 of 17 (24%) patients with low GSTP1 gene
expression (P = 0.015, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test). According
to this evidence, event-free survival analysis showed a statistically significant worse outcome for patients with high GSTP1
gene expression (Fig. 1).
NBDHEX in vitro activity and interactions with conventional
drugs. Both parental cell lines and CDDP-resistant variants proved
to be highly sensitive to NBDHEX, with a slight decrease of drug
sensitivity in variants with the highest levels of CDDP resistance
(Table 3). Parental cell lines and CDDP-resistant variants were also
sensitive to the apoptotic effects of NBDHEX. In fact, at equitoxic
concentrations, NBDHEX was able to induce apoptosis to a similar
extent in both parental cell lines and CDDP-resistant variants
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
The analysis of the in vitro activity of NBDHEX was also extended
to the whole panel of our drug-sensitive and drug-resistant human
osteosarcoma cell lines. All cell lines turned out to be highly
sensitive to NBDHEX, showing low and rather homogeneous
IC50 values, with no evidence of significant cross-resistance with
conventional drugs (Table 3). Only the U-2OS/DX580 variant
showed a 4.7-fold increased NBDHEX IC50 value compared with

parental cells, whose value was similar to those of U-2OS/CDDP1 Ag
or U-2OS/CDDP4 Ag cell lines.
Because NBDHEX targets GSTP1-1, we have analyzed the
relationship between NBDHEX activity and GSTP1-1 status inside
each cell line. Globally, our data showed a trend toward a reduced
in vitro activity of NBDHEX in cell lines with higher GSTP1-specific
enzymatic activity, as assessed by using ethacrynic acid as a
substrate (Fig. 2). In particular, CDDP-resistant variants showed
progressively increasing NBDHEX IC50 values according to their
level of GSTP1-specific enzymatic activity. The same tendency was
also evident, even if at a much lower extent, in U-2OS/DX– and
U-2OS/MTX–resistant variants. In drug-sensitive cell lines, the
situation was more heterogeneous, with all these cell lines being
highly sensitive to NBDHEX, with the sole exception of SARG.
Most of them, however, had GSTP1-1 activities similar to that of the
U-2OS/CDDP300 variant.
The in vitro efficacy of NBDHEX in combination with CDDP was
evaluated after either simultaneous or sequential two-drug
exposure in both parental cell lines and CDDP-resistant variants.
As shown in Table 4, simultaneous exposure of all cell lines to
NBDHEX and CDDP produced mostly additive interactions, with a
synergistic effect in U-2OS/CDDP4 Ag variant. Analyses of sequential drug exposure revealed mostly additive effects (Table 4).
However, when cells were treated with NBDHEX as the first drug
followed immediately by CDDP, synergistic effects, instead of
additive ones, were observed on the variants with higher levels of
CDDP resistance.

Discussion
CDDP is one of the most effective antitumor agents currently
used for the chemotherapeutic treatment of several human
neoplasms and it is almost invariably included in chemotherapy
regimens for high-grade osteosarcoma, together with DX, high-dose
MTX, and ifosfamide (20, 21). Although high-grade osteosarcoma
can be considered as a CDDP-responsive tumor, it may present an
inherent or acquired resistance to this drug, which severely limits
its clinical efficacy (20).
CDDP resistance is multifactorial, with several different mechanisms that can simultaneously be involved. Understanding these
mechanisms is critical for elucidating the bases of the CDDPresistant phenotype inside each tumor type. To do this, however,

adequate experimental models are essential. Studies done on these
models may also have great relevance for better clarifying the bases
of clinical unresposiveness to CDDP because there is evidence for a
general agreement between experimental findings and CDDP
resistance mechanisms that are clinically encountered (22).
Despite its high importance for high-grade osteosarcoma
treatment, only scarce and partially discordant information about
the CDDP resistance mechanisms that are specifically developed
by human osteosarcoma cells has been reported thus far. In the
study of Asada and colleagues (1), CDDP resistance acquired by one
human osteosarcoma cell line seemed to be related to both
reduced drug accumulation and increased drug efflux. Komiya and
colleagues (2) reported an inverse correlation between the intrinsic
GSH content and CDDP sensitivity of eight human osteosarcoma
cell lines. In the studies of Perego and colleagues (3) and Martelli
and colleagues (4), which were both done on the U-2OS cell line
and its 6-fold resistant variant U2-OS/Pt, resistance to CDDP

proved to be associated with a reduced susceptibility to druginduced apoptosis, decreased drug accumulation and DNA
damage, defects in mismatch repair, and a marginal increase in
GSH content. Therefore, by looking to all these results, it is obvious
that no conclusive evidence is available about the bases of CDDP
resistance in human osteosarcoma cells. Further studies are still
needed to clarify this phenomenon.

In the present study, we have described the establishment and
characterization of a panel of CDDP-resistant variants derived from
the U-2OS and Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cell lines, which were
used to define the effect in osteosarcoma cells of the most relevant
mechanisms reported to be responsible for CDDP resistance
in other human solid tumors. Our experimental model differs
from those mentioned above because it includes a panel of six

CDDP-resistant variants that were derived from two different
parental cell lines and with increasing levels of resistance. From
our point of view, this fact can lead to a better delineation of the
mechanisms that are most relevant for both the acquisition and the
degree of CDDP resistance in osteosarcoma cells.
In our experimental models, the degree of CDDP resistance
seemed to be mainly associated with the increase of both
intracellular levels and enzymatic activity of GSTP1-1. A possible,
less relevant contribution to CDDP resistance of these cells may
also derive from the increase of A-class GST, which, however, did
not seem to be as relevant as that of GSTP1-1. In fact, higher levels
of A-class GST proteins were detected only in the U-2OS/CDDP4 Ag
variant.
Other common mechanisms of CDDP resistance, including
reduced susceptibility to drug-induced apoptosis, decreased drug
accumulation or increased drug efflux, and decreased sensibility
to drug-induced DNA fragmentation, did not turn out to play
a significant role in the acquisition of CDDP resistance of our
resistant variants. The same evidence was found for GSH intracellular content, although the two variants with the highest
levels of CDDP resistance showed 1.4- to 1.8-fold increase in GSH
levels. This may suggest a possible involvement of this mechanism in the acquisition of CDDP resistance of our cell lines,
something which will be more specifically analyzed in further
studies.
Our findings are in line with a large part of evidence showing
that GSTP1-1 plays a central role in the degree of CDDP
unresponsiveness in several human tumor cell lines (5, 7, 23). In
particular, in osteosarcoma, it has recently been reported that
induction of GSTP1-1 overexpression in Saos-2 cells is associated
with the acquisition of resistance to CDDP and DX, whereas
GSTP1-1 silencing in HOS cells is responsible for an increased
chemosensitivity to these two drugs (24). In agreement with this
evidence, we have observed a low-level cross-resistance to DX
and MTX in the cisplatin-resistant cell lines with the highest levels
of GSTP1-1–specific activity (i.e., U-2OS/CDDP1 Ag and U-2OS/
CDDP4 Ag). These findings may be explained by the fact that the
activity of drugs that interact with DNA (e.g., DX) or interfere with
DNA synthesis and cell cycle (e.g., MTX) may be partly mediated by
c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation (25). Therefore, the
collateral low-level resistance against DX and MTX exhibited by
these two cell lines may be explained by taking into account the

www.aacrjournals.org

antiapoptotic effect of GSTP1-1 through its interaction with JNK;
this assumption, however, needs further experimental confirmation. The cross-resistance to DX may also be explained by taking
into account the reported evidence of a possible role of GSTP1 in
the formation of DX-GSH adducts, which can be recognized by ABC
transporters and extruded from the cells (26).
The GSTP1-1 increase has also been reported to significantly
contribute to clinical CDDP resistance in different human tumors
(5, 23). Among these, in head and neck squamos cell carcinoma cell
lines and primary tumors, amplification and overexpression of
GSTP1 have been shown to be related to CDDP resistance and poor
clinical outcome of patients treated with CDDP-based therapies
(27). In gliomas, the high expression of GSTP1 has been shown to
be associated with a more aggressive clinical course and to have a
strong adverse prognostic value for patient survival (28).
The few data reported thus far for osteosarcoma have suggested
that overexpression of GSTP1 after preoperative chemotherapy
seems to be related to drug treatment unresponsiveness of highgrade osteosarcoma patients (29). In agreement with these
observations, we also found that, in high-grade osteosarcoma
patients, high expression of the GSTP1 gene at diagnosis was
significantly associated with a higher relapse rate and a worse
event-free survival. Unfortunately, due to the low amount of tumor
material, we could not quantify either the GSTP1-1 protein level
or the GSTP1-1 enzymatic activity in our clinical samples. It is
worth noting that the range of GSTP1 expression level of our drugsensitive osteosarcoma cell lines overlapped the one found in
clinical samples, further underlining the adequacy of our experimental models. Therefore, on the basis of the evidence derived
from our cell lines, in which the GSTP1 gene expression and
protein levels were frequently related to those of GSTP1-specific
enzymatic activity, it might be speculated that osteosarcoma
patients with high GSTP1 gene expression at diagnosis may have a
worse treatment response due to increased GSTP1 activity–related
mechanisms. Considering all these findings together, GSTP1-1
emerged as a potential drug target, which may have potential for
consideration to overcome CDDP resistance and improve the
clinical outcome of high-grade osteosarcoma patients.
To circumvent CDDP resistance, the modification of platinumbased compounds has been proposed as a promising approach for
the development of non–cross-resistant CDDP analogs for clinical
use (5, 22). Unfortunately, several studies have shown that the

cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the resistance
to these CDDP analogs are either very similar or even identical to
those to CDDP, a fact that severely limits their clinical usefulness
(5). This situation has been slightly improved with the development
of triplatinum complexes, some of which have been reported to be
able to overcome CDDP resistance in experimental models (3).
However, there is still a need for new anticancer agents that are
able to circumvent CDDP resistance.
In our search for drugs targeting GSTs, we focused on the new
anticancer agent NBDHEX, which has been proved to predominantly target GSTP1-1, to be very active in several human tumor
cell lines, and to not be extruded from tumor cells by multidrug
resistance protein pumps (9–11). Moreover, the low concentrations
that are necessary to exert cytotoxic effects on human tumor cells,
together with the low toxicity exhibited in mice, have identified
NBDHEX as a promising new drug of potential clinical use (10). For
these reasons, NBDHEX seems to be a very interesting agent for
testing in our experimental models.
The results obtained in this study show that NBDHEX is
very active on human osteosarcoma cell lines and that it also
has a relevant efficacy on drug-resistant variants with increased
GSTP1-1 protein levels and enzymatic activities. Drug combination
studies further suggest that NBDHEX is a promising new drug for
osteosarcoma treatment, showing that it can be used together with

CDDP. The modality of administration, however, must be carefully
defined on the basis of the evidence provided by this study.
In conclusion, we have shown that GSTP1-1 is significantly
involved in CDDP resistance of human osteosarcoma cells and that
it has a relevant effect on the clinical outcome of high-grade
osteosarcoma patients. Moreover, our findings about the in vitro
efficacy of NBDHEX indicate that targeting GSTP1-1 with this drug
opens up a promising new therapeutic possibility for high-grade
osteosarcoma patients unresponsive to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens.
