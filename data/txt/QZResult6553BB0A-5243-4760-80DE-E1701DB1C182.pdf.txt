Abstract
In response to DNA damage, the ATM protein kinase activates
signal transduction pathways essential for coordinating cell
cycle progression with DNA repair. In the human disease
ataxia-telangiectasia, mutation of the ATM gene results in
multiple cellular defects, including enhanced sensitivity to
ionizing radiation (IR). This phenotype highlights ATM as
a potential target for novel inhibitors that could be used
to enhance tumor cell sensitivity to radiotherapy. A targeted
compound library was screened for potential inhibitors of the
ATM kinase, and CP466722 was identified. The compound is
nontoxic and does not inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) or PI3K-like protein kinase family members in cells.
CP466722 inhibited cellular ATM-dependent phosphorylation
events and disruption of ATM function resulted in characteristic cell cycle checkpoint defects. Inhibition of cellular
ATM kinase activity was rapidly and completely reversed by
removing CP466722. Interestingly, clonogenic survival assays
showed that transient inhibition of ATM is sufficient to sensitize cells to IR and suggests that therapeutic radiosensitization may only require ATM inhibition for short periods of
time. The ability of CP466722 to rapidly and reversibly regulate ATM activity provides a new tool to ask questions about
ATM function that could not easily be addressed using genetic
models or RNA interference technologies. [Cancer Res 2008;

Introduction
Cells respond to DNA damage by activating a complex network
of signal transduction pathways. These DNA damage response
(DDR) pathways include sensors responsible for recognizing the
genotoxic insult, transducers responsible for relaying/amplifying
the signal, and effectors that induce the appropriate cellular
response. Together, these signaling cascades are responsible for
coordinating cell cycle progression with DNA repair to facilitate
maintenance of genomic stability (1).
The human autosomal recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia
(A-T) has a complex clinical phenotype, including progressive
cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, immune deficiency, hypogonadism, growth retardation, premature aging,
radiosensitivity, and cancer predisposition (2). Cells obtained from
A-T patients display DNA damage checkpoint defects in G1, S, and

G2 phases of the cell cycle, increased chromosomal instability, and
radiosensitivity (3). The defective gene in A-T was identified as
ATM (A-T, mutated) and encodes a 350-kDa protein that belongs to
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) family of proteins (4).
Based on the phenotype displayed by A-T cells, it is not surprising
that the ATM protein kinase has been characterized as a major
regulator of the DDR pathways, along with the closely related
family members ATR (A-T and Rad3-related kinase) and DNA-PK
(DNA-dependent protein kinase; ref. 5). In an unperturbed cell,
ATM exists as an inactive dimer (or higher-order oligomer), but
the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) by ionizing
radiation (IR) or other insults activates the ATM kinase by
intermolecular autophosphorylation and dimer dissociation (6, 7).
Once activated, ATM phosphorylates several downstream substrates that contribute to the proper regulation of IR-induced
arrests in G1 phase (e.g., p53, Mdm2, and Chk2; refs. 8–12), S phase
(e.g., Nbs1, Smc1, Brca1, and FancD2; refs. 13–16), and G2 phase
(e.g., Brca1 and Rad17; refs. 16, 17) of the cell cycle.
Studies of cells that are functionally defective in different
components of the DDR pathways (e.g., BRCA1/2, NBS1, ATM,
Mre11, Fanconi anemia proteins, etc.) show cell cycle checkpoint
defects, decreased ability to repair damaged DNA, and an increased
sensitivity to IR and other DNA damaging agents (2, 15, 18, 19).
This latter observation highlights components of these DDR
pathways as potential therapeutic targets for the development of
small molecule inhibitors that could enhance the sensitivity of
tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapeutic/chemotherapeutic agents (20–22).
The idea of using small molecule inhibitors to disrupt ATM
function and sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapeutic/chemotherapeutic agents is not a novel concept (20–23). However, the most
commonly used ATM inhibitors (caffeine and wortmannin) are
neither specific nor useful in vivo, which has fueled an interest in
identifying more specific and potent inhibitors and resulted in the
recent identification of KU55933 (24). Using an in vitro kinase assay,
we screened a targeted library of f1,500 small molecule compounds for potential ATM inhibitors and identified CP466722. This
compound inhibited ATM kinase activity in vitro, but did not
inhibit PI3K or closely related PI3K-like protein kinase (PIKK)
family members. The compound also inhibited the ATM signal
transduction pathway in cells, disrupted cell cycle checkpoint
function, and sensitized tumor cells to IR. CP466722 is a rapidly
reversible inhibitor of ATM function, and transient exposure used
in clonogenic survival assays suggests that short-term inhibition
of ATM function is sufficient to sensitize cells to IR. This observation has potential implications for sensitization of tumor cells
in vivo, where drug pharmacokinetics becomes an important
consideration. Identification of CP466722 provides a novel
chemical structure that inhibits ATM function in cells and can
now be modified to generate more potent and specific agents
that could be effective at enhancing tumor cell killing in vivo.

Characterization of a Novel ATM Inhibitor

In addition, the fact that ATM function can be rapidly turned
off and on provides new opportunities for studying the ATM
pathway.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Pfizer identified CP466722 [2-(6,7-dimethoxyquinazolin-4-yl)-5-(pyridin2-yl)-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-amine]. CP466722 (3 mmol/L), KU55933 and
wortmannin (10 mmol/L; Sigma), and imatinib (10 mmol/L; TRC) were
resuspended in DMSO. Caffeine (100 mmol/L; Sigma) was resuspended in
dH2O. Aphidicolin (5 mmol/L; Sigma) was resuspended in methanol.
Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I; 0.1 mg/mL;
Invitrogen) was diluted in dH2O [0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA)].
Cells were routinely pretreated with DMSO (vehicle control), CP466722 or
wortmannin (30 min), and caffeine or KU55933 (1 h).

Cell Culture

Cells were plated (0.5  106 per plate) 24 h before treatment and
maintained at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere (5%CO2). HeLa, normal
diploid HFF, Mcf7 (American Type Culture Collection), HFF(expressing
hTERT; ref. 25), and A-T (GM02052 expressing hTERT; ref. 26) cells were
cultured in DMEM [10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mmol/L HEPES,
penicillin 100 units/mL, and streptomycin 100 Ag/mL]. ATM wild-type
and deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF; Arf-deficient background;
ref. 27) were cultured in DMEM (10% v/v FBS, 2 mmol/L glutamine,
0.1 mmol/L NEAA, 55 Amol/L h-mercaptoethanol, penicillin 100 units/mL,
and streptomycin 100 Ag/mL). Arf-deficient mouse pre-B cells expressing
the human p185-BCR-ABL isoform (p185+/Arf / , gift from Dr. R. Williams,
St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital) were plated (1  106cells/mL) 24 h
before treatment and cultured as previously described (28). For radiation
studies, IR from a 137Cs source was delivered at a rate of 120 cGy min 1
(Gammacell40-exactor, MDS Norton).
Cell viability. Cells were plated in triplicate (40,000 per plate) and
incubated as required before culture media, trypsinized cells were combined, and viability was determined by Vi-CELL XR cell viability analyzer
(Beckman Coulter).
Serum starvation and IGF-I stimulation. Cells were plated as normal,
incubated for 24 h before being removed from culture media, washed with,
and then cultured for 24 h in normal or low serum DMEM (0.1% v/v FBS,
10 mmol/L HEPES, penicillin 100 units/mL, and streptomycin 100 Ag/mL).
Cells were stimulated by addition of IGF-I (10 ng/mL) for 20 min at 37jC
before harvesting.

In vitro Kinase Assays
To screen for small molecule inhibitors of ATM kinase activity, an in vitro
kinase assay was adapted (10, 29) and an ELISA assay was developed which
measured the phosphorylation status of the ATM downstream target p53.
Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)–p53(1-101) and full-length
flag-tagged ATM and ATR were purified for use in the ELISA and in vitro
kinase assays. Briefly, Nunc 96-well Maxisorp plates were coated overnight
(4jC) with 2 Ag of purified recombinant GST-p53(1-101) in PBS. All
subsequent incubations were performed at room temperature. The plates
were washed (0.05% v/v Tween/PBS) before addition of purified recombinant full-length ATM kinase (30–60 ng) in a final volume of 80 AL of
reaction buffer (20 mmol/L HEPES, 50 mmol/L NaCl2, 10 mmol/L MgCl2,
10 mmol/L MnCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, and 1 Amol/L ATP) in the presence or
absence of compound. Compounds (10 Amol/L) were added to plates in
duplicate, and the kinase assay was incubated (90 min). Plates were washed
(0.05% v/v Tween/PBS), blocked (1 h, 1% w/v BSA/PBS), and rinsed before
anti–phosphorylated (Ser15) p53 antibody (1:1,000/PBS) was added to the
plates and incubated (1 h). To reduce, nonspecific binding plates were
washed (0.05% v/v Tween/PBS) before incubation (1 h) with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody
(1:5,000/PBS, Promega). Secondary antibody that was linked to the
phosphorylated GST-p53(1-101) protein was detected with TMB substrate
reagent (Pierce). Plates were developed (15–30 min), and the reaction was

stopped ( final concentration, 1 mol/L H2SO4) before absorbance was
determined (E450 nm, AnalystAD plate-reader, LJL Systems). Compounds
that inhibited ATM kinase activity in ELISA assays were characterized with
respect to inhibition of ATM/ATR kinases using in vitro kinase assays.
Western blotting using the anti–phosphorylated (Ser15) p53 antibody was
used as a readout of ATM/ATR inhibition. Extended analysis of CP466722
(10 Amol/L) against a commercially available panel of kinases was
performed by Upstate.

Western Blotting
Cells were harvested, lysed (TGN buffer), quantitated, and prepared for
Western blotting analysis, as previously described (7). Antibodies were
diluted at 1:1,000 (5% w/v BSA/TBST or 5% w/v milk/TBST): Sigma, anti–hactin; Santa Cruz, anti-p53, anti-Chk1-G4; Cell Signaling Technology,
PathScan-Bcr/Abl activity assay, anti-cAbl, anti-CrkL, anti–phosphorylated

Chk2, anti–phosphorylated (Ser345) Chk1, anti–phosphorylated (Ser308)
Akt, anti–phosphorylated (Thr473) Akt, anti-Akt; Millipore, anti–histone
H2A(acidic patch), anti–phosphorylatd (Ser139) H2AX; Bethyl Labs, antiSMC1; Miscellaneous, anti–phosphorylated (Ser957) SMC1 (30), anti-ATM
(MAT3; gift from Y. Shiloh), and anti–phosphorylated (Ser1981) ATM (6).
ImageJ3 was used to quantitate band density on autoradiograms from
Western blotting, and relative inhibition was calculated as percentage of
control.

Flow Cytometric Analysis
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were harvested and fixed (4jC) with 70%
v/v ethanol-PBS. Cells (1  106) were washed (PBS) and incubated
(30 min/dark) at room temperature in PBS [10 Ag/mL propidium iodide
(Sigma), 250 Ag/mL RNaseA (Qiagen)]. DNA content was determined using
a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson), and data were analyzed (CellQuest
software).
Immunofluorescent detection of phosphorylated histone H3. Cells
were harvested 1 h after IR and fixed ( 20jC) with 70% v/v ethanol-PBS.
Cells were stained and analyzed as previously described (31).

Clonogenic Survival Assay
HeLa or A-T (GM02052 expressing hTERT) cells were plated in triplicate
(0.5  106 per plate) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were pretreated: DMSO,
CP466722, or KU55933 before IR (0–10 Gy). Cells were incubated for 4 h after
IR before media was removed, and cells were washed (PBS), trypsinized,
counted, replated (2,000 per plate, 10-cm plates) in the absence of drug, and
incubated for 10 d. Before colony counting, cells were washed (PBS), stained
(PBS, 0.0037% v/v formaldehyde, 0.1% w/v crystal violet), rinsed (dH2O), and
dried. Defined populations (>50 cells) were counted as one surviving colony;
data were calculated as percentage surviving colonies relative to control
plates F SE.

Results
Identification of an in vitro inhibitor of the ATM kinase.
Large amounts of purified protein would be required to run high
throughput screens to identify small molecule inhibitors of ATM.
Therefore, a directed screen-based approach was adopted where a
library of 1,500 compounds was selected based on known kinase
inhibitor templates and calculated kinase pharmacophores from
the Pfizer proprietary chemical file. These compounds were
screened using an in vitro ELISA assay, with potential inhibitors
being identified by a decreased ability of purified ATM kinase to
phosphorylate GST-p53(1-101) substrate (data not shown). Compounds identified by this assay were subjected to an in vitro kinase
assay to screen out false positives (data not shown). This screening
approach identified the compound CP466722 (Fig. 1) as a candidate

for characterization as an ATM inhibitor in tissue culture models.
Although the ATM-related kinase, ATR, was not inhibited by
CP466722 in vitro, inhibitory activities against abl and src kinases
were noted in this in vitro screen.
Lack of toxicity and inhibition of ATM kinase activity in
human and mouse cells. As an initial assessment of cellular
effects of exposure to CP466722, no adverse effects on cell viability
were observed in primary and hTERT-immortalized human diploid
fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S1) or in a variety of human tumor
cell lines (data not shown), even after continuous exposure for
72 hours. To establish whether CP466722 could inhibit ATM kinase
activity in cells and to determine an effective concentration for
inhibition, HeLa cells were exposed to IR in the presence of varying
concentrations of the inhibitor and phosphorylation of ATM
targets was assessed. The established ATM inhibitor KU55933
was used as a positive control for ATM inhibition (24). IR-induced
ATM kinase activity resulted in the expected increases in ATMdependent phosphorylation events and CP466722 treatment inhibited all of these events. Virtually complete disruption of ATM
cellular activity was noted at doses of 6 Amol/L and above (Fig. 2).
Disruption of ATM-dependent phosphorylation events and inhibition of ATM-dependent p53 induction were also observed in
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and primary and immortalized
diploid human fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). Overall,
the response to IR in cells treated with CP466722 was similar to
that seen in cells lacking ATM (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Because one future goal is to characterize the ability of CP466722
to sensitize tumors to radiation or chemotherapeutic agents in
murine models in vivo, it was important to know if CP466722
was effective at inhibiting Atm kinase in mouse cells. The ATM
signaling pathway is conserved from human to mouse and ATM
kinase activity can be monitored by analyzing similar downstream

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

events (30). An exception is phosphorylation of Chk2 on Thr68,
which is difficult to detect in mouse cells. Therefore, we examined
phosphorylation of the conserved residue Thr387 of Chk2, which is
an ATM-dependent event in human cells (32, 33). Atm wild-type
and deficient MEFs were exposed to IR in the presence or absence
of CP466722 or KU55933. In Atm wild-type MEFs, ATM kinase
activity was induced by IR and there were strong increases in
phosphorylation of SMC1 (Ser957), Chk2 (Thr387), and p53 (Ser15)
relative to control (Supplementary Fig. S3). These phosphorylation
events were ATM-dependent, as no IR-induced increases in
phosphorylation were detected in Atm-deficient MEFs. As with
human cells, both CP466722 and KU55933 inhibited p53 induction
and all of these ATM-dependent phosphorylation events in mouse
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
CP466722 does not inhibit PI3K, PI3K-like protein kinases,
or Abl kinase in cells. The ATR kinase is also activated by DNA
damage and other cellular stresses (e.g., UV and aphidicolin) and
phosphorylates, many of the same substrates as ATM (1). Whereas
ATM is preferentially activated by DSBs and phosphorylates Chk2
on Thr68, ATR is preferentially activated by stalled replication forks
and phosphorylates Ser345 of Chk1 (34, 35). Although CP466722 did
not affect ATR kinase activity in vitro, we examined the ability
of the compound to affect ATR kinase activity in cells. hTERTimmortalized human fibroblasts were treated for 1 hour with the
replication inhibitor aphidicolin in the presence or absence of
CP466722 (36). ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 (Ser345)
was not inhibited by CP466722 (Fig. 3A), although ATM-dependent
phosphorylation of Chk2 (Thr68) was blocked in these cells. Failure
to inhibit aphidicolin-induced Chk1 (Ser345) phosphorylation in

concentrations of CP466722, DMSO, or 10 Amol/L KU55933 (KU ) before
mock-IR (Control ) or IR (2 Gy) followed by incubation at 37jC for 30 min before
being harvested. To determine the effect of CP466722 on ATM kinase activity,
ATM intermolecular autophosphorylation at Ser1981 and phosphorylation of
downstream ATM targets were monitored by Western blotting analysis
(representative of several repeat experiments).

Characterization of a Novel ATM Inhibitor

Figure 3. PI3K and PIKK family members are not inhibited
by CP466722 in cells. HFF(hTERT) and A-T(hTERT)
fibroblasts were used to establish the effects of CP466722
on PI3K and PIKK family members. A, cells were
preincubated with DMSO or 6 Amol/L of CP466722 (CP )
before being mock-treated or treated with 20 Amol/L
aphidicolin (Aph ) for a 1-h period at 37jC before
harvesting. As a control, cells were preincubated with
DMSO or 6 Amol/L of CP466722 before being exposed
to IR (2 Gy) followed by incubation at 37jC for 30 min and
harvesting. To determine the effect of CP466722 on the
ATM and ATR checkpoint pathways in response to
aphidicolin and IR, phosphorylated (Ser345) Chk1 and
phosphorylated (Thr68) Chk2 were monitored by Western
blotting analysis. B, cells were preincubated with DMSO,
6 Amol/L CP466722 (CP ), or 10 Amol/L KU55933 (KU )
before mock-IR (Control ) or IR (2 Gy) followed by
incubation at 37jC for 30 min and harvesting. As a
measure of ATM/DNA-PK kinase activity, phosphorylated
(Ser139) H2AX was monitored by Western blotting
analysis. C, cells were cultured under normal (Control)
or serum-starved (SS ) conditions for a 24-h period
before being preincubated with DMSO, 6 Amol/L
CP466722 (CP ), 10 Amol/L KU55933 (KU ), or 200 nmol/L
wortmannin (W ). Cells were then subjected to growth
factor stimulation with IGF-I (10 ng/mL) for a 20-min period
at 37jC before being harvested. The activity of PI3K
and PIKK family members were assessed by monitoring
phosphorylated (Thr308) Akt and phosphorylated (Ser473)
Akt by Western blotting analysis (representative of
several repeat experiments).

cells lacking ATM provided even more definitive evidence that
CP466722 does not inhibit ATR kinase in cells (Fig. 3A).
DNA-PK is another PIKK family member that contributes to
damage-induced signaling, and both ATM and DNA-PK can phosphorylate histone H2AX on Ser139 after IR (37). To investigate
potential effects of CP466722 on DNA-PK, phosphorylation of
histone H2AX (Ser139) was assessed in wild-type and A-T cells
because DNA-PK phosphorylates this site in the absence of ATM
kinase activity (24, 37). Whereas H2AX (Ser139) phosphorylation
after IR was inhibited by CP466722 or KU55933 in wild-type cells,
these ATM inhibitors failed to inhibit IR-induced H2AX phosphorylation in A-T cells (Fig. 3B), demonstrating a lack of detectable effects on DNA-PK.
In response to growth factor stimulation, AKT is activated by
phosphorylation of Thr308 by the PI3K pathway and Ser473 by other
PIKK family members (e.g., mTOR, DNA-PK, and ATM; ref. 38).

www.aacrjournals.org

To show that CP466722 was not inhibiting PI3K or PIKK family
members, human fibroblasts were serum starved for 24 hours
before being stimulated with IGF-I either in the presence or
absence of CP466722, KU55933, or wortmannin (Fig. 3C). Serum
starvation resulted in an almost complete loss of AKT (Thr308/
Ser473) phosphorylation. These phosphorylation events were
strongly induced upon addition of IGF-I to serum-starved cells
and, as expected, strongly inhibited by the known PI3K inhibitor
wortmannin. No inhibition was noted with CP466722 or KU55933
treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that CP466722
inhibits ATM kinase, but does not affect the cellular activity of PI3K
or PIKK family members.
Abl and Src kinases were identified in the initial in vitro screens
as potential targets of CP466722. To address whether CP466722
inhibits cellular Abl and Src kinases, we used a mouse pre-B
cell (p185+/Arf / ) model (28). In this system, the BCR-Abl

(p185) fusion protein is constitutively active, driving autophosphorylation of residue Tyr245 (BCR-Abl and endogenous Abl) and
phosphorylation of a downstream target CrkL on Tyr207 (Supplementary Fig. S4A; refs. 39–41). Src kinase undergoes intermolecular
autophosphorylation of residue Tyr416 on its activation loop to
become fully activated (42, 43). In cells expressing BCR-Abl, SRC
kinases are activated, and increased levels of Src (Tyr416) phos-

phorylation have been reported, suggesting that Src is active
and undergoing autophosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4A;
refs. 41, 44).
As a control, CP466722 and KU55933 were shown to inhibit ATM
kinase activity in the mouse pre-B cells as shown by disruption of
p53 (Ser15) phosphorylation and p53 stabilization in response to IR
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). To establish whether the inhibitors
affected Abl and Src kinase activity, the mouse pre-B cells were
treated with CP466722, KU55933, or imatinib (Abl kinase inhibitor)
as a positive control (45). As expected, autophosphorylation of
BCR-Abl (Tyr245), endogenous Abl (Tyr245), and Abl-dependent
phosphorylation of CrkL (Tyr207) were all detected in control
mouse pre-B cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Imatinib inhibited all
these phosphorylation events, whereas CP466722 or KU55933 failed
to inhibit BCR-Abl kinase activity or phosphorylation of downstream targets. Although imatinib is not reported to directly inhibit
Src kinase activity, cellular Src (Tyr416) autophosphorylation was
prevented by imatinib under these experimental conditions
(41, 45, 46). Treatment with both CP466722 and KU55933 resulted
in decreased Src (Tyr416) autophosphorylation relative to the
control cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A). These data indicate that at
doses capable of inhibiting ATM, CP466722 and KU55933 do not
inhibit Abl kinase activity in cells; however, both compounds have
inhibitory effects on Src kinase activity in this system (84% and 73%
inhibition at 10 Amol/L, respectively).
CP466722 disrupts ATM-dependent cell cycle checkpoints in
cells. Small molecule disruption of the ATM signal transduction
pathway should recapitulate the A-T cellular phenotypes, including
characteristic cell cycle checkpoint defects. Cells lacking ATM
exhibit pronounced G2 accumulation over time after IR due to a
failure to arrest in S phase (31). In response to IR, HeLa cells
treated with either KU55933 or CP466722 resulted in an enhanced
proportion of cells with G2-M DNA content and a decreased
proportion of cells with G1-phase DNA content relative to DMSOtreated cells (Fig. 4A). In the absence of IR-induced DNA damage,
these doses of CP466722 and KU55933 had no effect on cell cycle
distribution during this time frame (Fig. 4A, i and ii).
To establish whether CP466722 and KU55933 treatment
disrupted the ATM-dependent G2-M checkpoint (31), asynchronous populations of HeLa cells were pretreated with either
DMSO, caffeine, CP466722, or KU55933 before being exposed to
mock-IR or IR. A decrease in the percentage of mitotic cells after
IR in the presence of DMSO indicated an IR-induced G2 arrest,
whereas both KU55933 and CP466722 prevented this IR-induced
decrease (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the effects seen with the less
specific ATM/ATR inhibitor, caffeine, neither compound affected
G2-M progression in the absence of DNA damage (Fig. 4B).

Figure 4. CP466722 inhibits ATM function in response to IR-induced DNA
damage. A, an asynchronous population of HeLa cells was preincubated
with DMSO, 6 Amol/L CP466722, or 10 Amol/L KU55933 before mock-IR or IR
(5 Gy). After irradiation, cells were incubated at 37jC for 16 h before being
harvested, fixed, and stained with propidium iodide for cell cycle analysis by flow
cytometry. i, DNA content profiles are representative of several repeat
experiments. ii, data displayed by the DNA content profiles were analyzed
and the cell cycle phase information is represented graphically. B, an
asynchronous population of HeLa cells was preincubated with DMSO, 6 Amol/L
CP466722, 2 mmol/L caffeine, or 10 Amol/L KU55933 before mock-IR or IR
(2 Gy). After irradiation, cells were incubated at 37jC for 1 h before being
harvested, fixed, and stained for phosphorylated (Ser10) histone H3 and
propidium iodide. DNA content and phosphorylated (Ser10) histone H3 positivity
were determined by flow cytometry, and the data displayed are representative
of several repeat experiments.

Characterization of a Novel ATM Inhibitor

Figure 5. CP466722 can be used as a molecular switch to regulate cellular ATM kinase activity. A, CP466722 potently inhibits ATM for at least 8 h in culture. HeLa
cells were preincubated with DMSO, 6 Amol/L CP466722, or 10 Amol/L KU55933 to reach the experimental start point (i.e., 0 h). After preincubation, cells were exposed
to mock-IR (Control ) or IR (2 Gy) at the indicated time points (0–8 h). After irradiation, cells were incubated at 37jC for 30 min before being harvested (the times
displayed in the figure represent the time of IR exposure and do not include the 30-min recovery time). To determine whether these compounds displayed a limited
half-life with respect to inhibition of ATM kinase activity, ATM-intermolecular autophosphorylation at Ser1981 and phosphorylation of Chk2 (Thr68) were determined
by Western blotting analysis (representative of several repeat experiments). B, CP466722 and KU55933 display rapid and complete reversibility of ATM kinase
inhibition in culture. HeLa cells were preincubated with DMSO, 6 Amol/L CP466722, or 10 Amol/L KU55933 to reach the experimental start point (i.e., 0 h). After
preincubation, the compounds were either left on the cells (+DMSO, +CP466722, and +KU55933 ) or removed ( DMSO, CP466722, and KU55933 ) and fresh
media were added. After wash off, the cells were exposed to mock-IR (Control ) or IR (2Gy) at the indicated times (0–4 h). Irradiated cells were incubated at 37jC for
30 min before being harvested (the times displayed in the figure represent the time of IR exposure and do not include the 30-min recovery time). To determine whether
the inhibition of ATM kinase activity had been reversed by removal of the compounds, ATM intermolecular autophosphorylation at Ser1981 and phosphorylation of
downstream ATM targets were determined by Western blotting analysis (representative of several repeat experiments).

Taken together, the results show that CP466722 is capable of
disrupting ATM function and recapitulates checkpoint defects
reported for A-T cells.
Chemical inhibition of ATM can be rapidly and completely
reversed. KU55933 displays strong inhibition of ATM for at least
4 hours in tissue culture (24). To determine whether CP466722
could inhibit ATM for prolonged periods of time in tissue culture,
HeLa cells were incubated with either DMSO, KU55933, or
CP466722 for various times and then exposed to IR and harvested
after a 30-min recovery period. Relative to control cells, the results
show that ATM was activated by IR to the same degree in the
presence of DMSO at all time points tested (Fig. 5A, left). Similar to
KU55933, IR fails to induce ATM activation and downstream
signaling in the presence of CP466722, and inhibition of the ATMdependent phosphorylation events are maintained over the 8-hour
time course of the experiment (Fig. 5A, center and right). These

results show that CP466722 strongly inhibits ATM kinase activity
for at least an 8-hour period in tissue culture.
As part of the characterization of CP466722, we were interested
in the reversibility of the ATM inhibition. To address this question,
HeLa cells were pretreated with either DMSO, CP466722, or
KU55933 and then washed with addition of fresh culture media in
the absence of any compounds. Cells were subsequently exposed
to IR at various times (Fig. 5B). In the presence of DMSO, the
IR-induced ATM-dependent phosphorylation events were easily
detected both before and after wash-off. In contrast, the presence
of CP466722 or KU55933 strongly inhibited these ATM-dependent
phosphorylation events in response to IR (Fig. 5B). However, all
ATM-dependent phosphorylation events were detected within the
first 30 minutes after removal of the inhibitors (Fig. 5B; 0 hour
CP466722 or KU55933), and inhibition was reversed completely
within 1 hour after wash-off (Fig. 5B; 30 minutes CP466722 or

KU-5933). Taken together, these results show that the ATM pathway can be rapidly inhibited; however, after removal of these
compounds, the inhibition can be rapidly and completely reversed.
Transient inhibition of ATM sensitizes cells to IR induced
DNA damage. One characteristic feature of cells deficient in
functional ATM is their increased sensitivity to IR-induced DNA
damage. This has been shown genetically using A-T cells, which
have permanently disrupted ATM function or by chemical inhibition (KU55933), where ATM function has been disrupted for
prolonged periods of time in cells (24). Based on the results
indicating that inhibition of ATM kinase activity by these compounds was rapidly reversible, we were interested in whether
transient inhibition of ATM could sensitize cells to IR. After pretreatment of HeLa cells with either DMSO, CP466722, or KU55933,
the cells were exposed to the indicated doses of IR and allowed to
recover for a period of 4 hours in the presence of DMSO or the
inhibitors. The cells were then replated and incubated for a period
of 10 days to allow for colony formation in the absence of inhibitors. Similar plating efficiencies were achieved in the presence
(41 F 3.7% and 39 F 1.7%) or absence (42 F 4.2% and 40 F 2.0%) of
CP466722 and KU55933, respectively, suggesting that neither
compound affected cell plating nor cell viability. Transient exposure to either CP466722 or KU55933 sensitized cells to IR (Fig. 6).
Because the compounds were only present for a 4-hour period and
because the ATM pathway is reactivated rapidly upon removal of
these compounds (Fig. 5B), it seems that a transient (4 hours or
less) inhibition of ATM is sufficient to enhance the sensitivity of
HeLa cells to IR. Importantly, no differences in clonogenic survival
of cells from A-T patients were noted in the presence or absence of
CP466722 (Supplementary Fig. S5), demonstrating that the radiosensitization caused by this compound was in fact due to ATM
inhibition and not any off-target effects.

Discussion
Mammalian cells are constantly at risk from potentially lethal
or mutagenic genomic lesions from both endogenous (e.g., free
oxygen radicals) and exogenous (e.g., UV, IR) sources. As a result,
eukaryotic cells have developed an intricate network of signal

transduction pathways (DDR pathways) that allow them to sense
and repair damaged DNA (1). Loss of function of critical proteins
from these pathways can leave cells with enhanced sensitivity to
DNA damaging agents (47). The ATM kinase is an important
component of these DDR pathways, and cells deficient for ATM
(A-T) display hypersensitivity to certain DNA damaging agents (3).
Based on these observations, it has been proposed that specific
inhibition of ATM function in combination with current radiotherapeutic/chemotherapeutic treatments may result in enhanced
cancer cell killing (20, 22–24). This principal has been shown by the
ability of specific antisense/small interfering RNA to attenuate
ATM function and sensitize certain cancer cell lines to IR (48–50).
Furthermore, the recent identification and characterization of the
ATM inhibitor KU55933 has strengthened this hypothesis and
shown that specific small molecule inhibition of ATM in vitro is
capable of sensitizing human cancer cell lines to IR and topoisomerase poisons (24). Our aim in this study was to identify and
characterize a novel inhibitor of the ATM protein kinase with a
future goal of modifying this small molecule for characterization
and use with in vivo models. In this paper, we identified the
nontoxic compound CP466722 as an inhibitor of ATM and offer a
comparison to the established ATM inhibitor KU55933 (24).
In response to IR, ATM initiates a signaling cascade and
phosphorylates downstream targets (e.g., p53, Chk2, and SMC1) on
characteristic sites which can be used as a measure of cellular ATM
kinase activity (8, 10, 11, 13). CP466722 disrupts these cellular
phosphorylation events in a dose-dependent manner in several
different cell types and recapitulates the signaling defects observed
in A-T cells (3). Closely related kinases (DNA-PK and ATR) share
some downstream targets with ATM and phosphorylate common
sites on these substrates (29, 35, 37); however, we found that
CP466722 does not inhibit ATR kinase activity in vitro or the kinase
activities of ATR or DNA-PK in cells. Furthermore, unlike the
pan-PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, CP466722 does not inhibit PI3K
activity in cells. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 is
reported to be regulated by several PIKK family members,
including DNA-PK, ATM, and mTOR (38). Although, Akt (Ser473)
phosphorylation was inhibited by wortmannin, neither CP466722
nor KU55933 affected this modification. This implies that ATM

Figure 6. Transient inhibition of ATM kinase activity is able to sensitize cells to IR-induced DNA damage. HeLa cells were plated in triplicate and incubated for
24 h. Cells were preincubated with DMSO, 6 Amol/L CP466722, or 10 Amol/L KU55933 before being exposed to a range of doses of IR (0–10 Gy). Cells were incubated
for 4 h after irradiation before being replated in fresh media in the absence of drug and incubated for a period of 10 d to allow for colony formation. To determine
the effect of transient ATM inhibition by CP466722 and KU55933 in response to IR, the surviving colonies were counted and the data were presented on a log axis
(represents the mean of three independent experiments F SE).

is not required for this phosphorylation event under these experimental conditions and could indicate that these inhibitors do not
affect additional PI3K-like protein kinases, such as mTOR (38).
Similar to KU55933, these results highlight CP466722 as a relatively
specific inhibitor of ATM and a marked improvement on previous
compounds used to inhibit ATM, such as wortmannin and caffeine.
Extended analysis of CP466722 indicated that Abl and Src kinase
activity were inhibited in vitro. However, BCR-Abl kinase activity
was not affected in cells treated with this compound at doses that
inhibit ATM, suggesting Abl is not a cellular target of CP466722.
In contrast, autophosphorylation of Src (Tyr416) was reduced by
both CP466722 and KU55933, although it is not clear whether these
effects are direct or due to inhibition of signal transduction
pathways that lead to Src kinase activation. This shows that there is
still a need to modify and improve the specificity of these ATM
inhibitors, and further characterization is required to identify and
understand any potential off-target effects. It is noted that the lack
of radiosensitization of A-T cells by CP466722 suggests that the
inhibition of Src is not contributing to the radiosensitization
induced by the drug.
Inhibition of ATM activity with CP466722 induced cellular effects
indistinguishable from those seen in cells lacking ATM, including
cell cycle checkpoint defects and radiosensitization (3). Similar to
KU55933, CP466722 rapidly and potently inhibits ATM over a period
of several hours demonstrating reasonable stability in tissue culture
(24). However, upon removal of either CP466722 or KU55933 from
tissue culture media, ATM kinase activity and the subsequent
phosphorylation of downstream targets could be completely and
rapidly restored. This ability to transiently inhibit ATM function
followed by reactivation within such a short time frame is novel and
opens new avenues for study of the ATM pathway. In effect, these
inhibitors can be used as molecular switches to influence the
immediate ATM-dependent DNA damage response and the
subsequent repair process that contribute to cell survival.
Transient small molecule inhibition of ATM in vitro recapitulates
the cellular A-T phenotype of increased sensitivity to IR while
causing no additional sensitivity in an A-T cell line. However,
the sensitization induced by these short-term exposures do not
completely reflect the characteristic low-dose hypersensitivity
phenotype of A-T cells, which could highlight a difference between
long-term and short-term inhibition. In the study by Hickson and
colleagues (24), long-term small molecule inhibition of ATM shows
enhanced sensitivity to IR at low doses (1–2 Gy). Taken together,
these results suggest that during and, for a short period of time,
after IR, ATM plays an essential role in ensuring cellular survival

that is not compensated for by other DDR pathways and cannot be
rescued by reactivation of ATM. This concept is consistent with the
proposed critical role of ATM activation and activity in the earliest
steps of DSB repair (7). Further characterization of this observation
with these inhibitors is still required to understand the role of ATM
at these early time points. It could be informative to investigate the
effects of transient inhibition and reactivation of ATM in future
studies and determine how this influences cellular responses to
DNA breakage, including which damage response proteins are
recruited to DSBs and the kinetics of repair (7).
Because CP466722 can inhibit the ATM-signal transduction
pathway in murine cells, it may be possible to use mouse models to
begin to explore the effects of this compound in vivo. The observation that transient inhibition of ATM in tissue culture causes
measurable hypersensitivity to IR could imply that stable and
prolonged inhibition of ATM may not be needed to provide a
therapeutic window. This concept requires further investigation
and will require careful studies on drug delivery, distribution,
stability, and activity in vivo.
In summary, we have identified and characterized a new
inhibitor of ATM, which can be used to further characterize the
function of the ATM-signaling pathway and the immediate
molecular response to IR. In addition, this compound provides us
with a novel chemical structure that can be modified to enhance
potency, specificity, and ensure that second generation compounds
can be taken forward into in vivo models. Further characterization
of these inhibitors will help us to understand whether disruption
of ATM function in vivo is a plausible approach for enhancing
therapeutic potential.
