ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumour
in adults and one of the most aggressive cancers. PARP-1 is a nuclear protein
involved in multiple facets of DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. In this study
we dissected the action of PARP inhibition in different GBM cell lines with either
functional or mutated PTEN that confers resistance to diverse therapies. In PTEN
mutant cells, PARP inhibition induced a severe genomic instability, exacerbated
homologous recombination repair (HR) deficiency and down-regulated the Spindle
Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) factor BUBR1, leading to mitotic catastrophe (MC).
EGFR gene amplification also represents a signature of genetic abnormality in GBM.
To more effectively target GBM cells, co-treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an
EGFR blocker, erlotinib, resulted in a strong suppression of ERK1/2 activation and
in vivo the combined effect elicited a robust reduction in tumour development. In
conclusion, PARP inhibition targets PTEN-deficient GBM cells through accentuation of
SAC repression and aggravation of HR deficiency, leading to the induction of genomic
instability and eventually deriving to mitotic catastrophe (MC); the inhibition of PARP
and co-treatment with an inhibitor of pro-survival pathways strongly retarded in vivo
gliomagenesis.

INTRODUCTION

Loss of PTEN is a very prominent event during
gliomagenesis, occurring in about 36% of GBMs [1-3].
PTEN is a lipid phosphatase with a canonical role in
turning-off the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-1
signalling pathway; hence, loss of PTEN has oncogenic
consequences during gliomagenesis [4]. In addition, it is
becoming increasingly clear that PTEN has novel nuclear
functions, including transcriptional regulation of the
RAD51 gene, whose product is essential for homologous
recombination (HR) repair of DNA breaks [5].
The nuclear protein PARP-1, known to function as
a DNA damage sensor and to play a role in various DNA
repair pathways, has recently been implicated in a broad
variety of cellular functions, including transcriptional

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are lethal brain
tumours, highly resistant to therapy. An important
improvement in therapeutic response came from the use of
the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) in combination
with ionizing radiation (IR). Amongst the huge number
of genetic alterations that populate the GBM genomic
landscape, five genetic changes dominate: loss of tumour
suppressor and aging biomarker (Ink4a), acute renal
failure (Arf), cellular tumour antigen p53, or phosphatase
and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN); and
amplification of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR).

regulation [6, 7]. PARP inhibitors exhibit antitumour
activity in part due to their ability to induce synthetic
lethality in cells deficient for homologous recombination
repair [8-12] and also in triple negative breast cancer
cells [13, 14]. Up to date, the studies on GBM and PARP
inhibitors have focused on the use of these small molecules
as radio or chemo-potentiators [15-17]. In this study, we
report that primary glioma stem-like cells are targeted in
their ability to form neurospheres by PARP inhibitors;
moreover, mutant PTEN GBM cells are also sensitive to
PARP inhibitors by increasing genomic instability leading
to impaired G2/M arrest and MC. Additionally, PARP
inhibition strongly intensified HR deficiency in PTEN
mutant cells, that had already compromised HR [18-20]
and repressed the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint protein
BUBR1. Moreover, the combination of PARP inhibition
with an upstream blocker of pro-survival signalling
pathways arising from the EGFR, the EGFR inhibitor
erlotinib, induced a dramatic reduction in tumour growth
in an orthotopic mouse model. Thus, taking advantage of
PARP inhibitor-induced cell death in PTEN-mutant glioma
cells prone to genomic instability, and disabling survival
pathways through EGFR and PARP inhibition, could be
therapeutically exploited in the treatment of this malignant
tumour.

increased invasive properties. To further challenge PARPi
as anti GBM agents we tested them against established
GBM cell lines bearing either wild type or mutant PTEN.
Treatment with PARPi of either PTEN wild type or
mutant cell lines resulted in loss of cell viability (figure
1B, figure S1A) and cell death induction (figure 1C). Due
to the previously reported off-target effects of PJ34, the
PARP inhibitor olaparib was also tested, exerting similar
results (figure S4A). Interestingly, PTEN deficient cells
including U87MG displayed an increased sensitivity to
PARPi. However, U87MG, which has been previously
described to be extremely resistant to apoptotic cell
death [24], hardly increased apoptosis following PARPi
(figure 1D, S1B,C) or PARP-1 knockdown (figure S1D)
when compared with LN229 (PTEN proficient cell
line). Remarkably, PTEN silencing in LN229 cells and
PTEN restoration in U87MG cells resulted in increased
apoptotic cell death following PARPi (figure S2A,B). This
apparently contradictory result may be explained through
the genetic context of each cell line: while LN229 cells
possess a functional apoptotic machinery that is activated
following PARP inhibition, PTEN re-introduction in
U87MG cells partially restored apoptotic ability.
Combining PARPi with the methylating agent
temozolomide (TMZ) or ionising radiation (IR) did
not potentiate cell killing (figure S3A,B,C and data not
shown). Thus, PARP inhibition per se was sufficient to
induce cell death in PTEN deficient cells more efficiently
than the currently used chemotherapeutic drug TMZ or IR.
Moreover, the G2/M arrest was also notably diminished in
U87MG cells following PARP inhibition respect to PTEN
wild type cells (figures 1E,1F and S4B) and U87MG cells
transiently restored with PTEN partially recovered G2/M
arrest (figure S2C). In addition, TMZ remarkably induced
an arrest in G2/M at 72 hours and the combination with
PARPi produced similar effect to PARP inhibition alone
(figure S3D).

RESULTS
PJ34 and olaparib interfere with neurospheres
formation in primary glioma cells and impacts
differently on cell viability in PTEN wild type and
PTEN-mutant glioma cells
As a first approach to analyze the potential of PARP
inhibition (PARPi) as monotherapy against GBM we
evaluated self-renewal capability, which is a marker of
stemness in GSCs, using neurospheres formation assay
in primary patient-derived PTEN-proficient GSCs TG1
[21] with two different PARP inhibitors: PJ34 (IC 20
nM) and olaparib (IC 5 nM). PJ34 targets mainly PARPs
synthesizing proteins but some off-target effects have also
been reported, suggesting the effect of PJ34 on cancer cells
may not be attributed exclusively to PARP inhibition [22,
23]. For that reason we also used the clinically relevant
PARPi olaparib. Following seven days of treatment,
neurospheres formation decreased significantly with
either PJ34 or olaparib (figure 1A). Similar results have
been reported by Rich and colleagues showing that PARPi
preferentially targeted GSCs [16]. Our data support that
PARPi targets primary glioma cells in part by perturbing
self renewal/GICs phenotype.

PARP inhibition induced down-regulation of the
spindle assembly checkpoint protein BUBR1
leading to mitotic instability in PTEN deficient
glioma cells
To further elucidate the mechanistic aspects
regarding the effect of PARP inhibition in both PTEN
proficient and PTEN mutant GBM cells we explored the
induction of genomic instability. PTEN deficient cells
lack G2/M arrest following PARPi treatment (figure 1E
and F). The BUBR1 protein ensures accurate segregation
of chromosomes through its role in the mitotic checkpoint
and the establishment of proper microtubule-kinetochore
attachments; and sustained high-level expression of
BUBR1 preserves genomic integrity [25]. In figure 2A
we show that PARP inhibition induced BUBR1 downregulation in U87MG PTEN-deficient cells, suggesting
4791

that the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint is compromised
in U87MG. Further confirmation for the effect of PARP
inhibition on BUBR1 levels was established by the use of
a different PARP inhibitor, olaparib, that induced BUBR1
down-regulation in U87MG but not in LN229 cells (figure
S4C). Furthermore, silencing PTEN in LN229 cells also
results in BUBR1 decrease after PARP inhibition (figure
2B) while introduction of PTEN in U87MG cells delayed
BUBR1 loss (figure 2B). In addition, in silico analysis
using the database Array Express of U87MG cells
transduced with wild type PTEN showed a statistically
significant decrease in BUB1B expression (the gene
for BUBR1) in PTEN transduced cells as well as in the
gene coding for the SAC-related factor (and BUBR1
associated protein) AURKB (-2,62 and -3.31 fold decrease
respectively). In order to approach the clinical relevance

of these variations in BUBR1 levels as function of PTEN
we used two available datasets: Oncomine and Array
Express from EMBO-EBI. BUB1B gene expression was
significantly increased in GBM patients (Figure 2C; p=
2.2E-20, fold change 3.856, number of samples: normal
brain n=23, glioblastoma n=81). Moreover, there was an
inverse correlation between PTEN and BUB1B expression
in GBM patients with low survival (Figure 2D; less than
12 months; n=15, p<0.001, pearson -0.7592) further
supporting that targeting BUBR1 (as PARPi does) could
be used as rational therapy in PTEN deficient GBM.
Interestingly, increased expression of BUB1B correlated
with decreased patient survival (Figure 2E).
Another hallmark of genomic instability is
micronuclei formation. Following PARP inhibition,
U87MG cells, but not LN229 cells displayed a time-

dependent accumulation of micronuclei (figure 2F).
Polyploids are the result of cytokinesis failure after
G2/M arrest. However PTEN-deficient cells, unable
to activate the G2/M checkpoint, progress to continue
cell cycle and complete aberrant mitosis. As shown in
figure 1E, PARP inhibition-induced arrest in G2/M in
PTEN-mutant cells was almost suppressed, implying that
cells will progress in cell cycle, accumulating genomic
instability, and eventually Mitotic Catastrophe but not
polyploids (figure 2G, S4D). Interestingly, and consistent
with increased G2/M arrest following PARPi after PTEN
restoration (figure S2C), PTEN over-expression in
U87MG also increased polyploidy (figure S2D). However,
the slight increase observed after long-time of PJ34
treatment suggests a possible interference of the genetic
background of each cell line.
Taken together, these results led us to conclude that
PARP inhibition compromised mitotic checkpoint through
down-regulation of BUBR1, preventing from mitotic

arrest only in a PTEN deficient context.
To further understand the impact of PARP inhibition
in PTEN mutant cells we performed an expression array
focalized in genes involved in cell cycle regulation
and DNA repair. In table 1 we have represented genes
whose expression was significantly modified after
PARP inhibition in U87MG cells. Up-regulated mRNAs
included p53-dependent genes such as BBC3/PUMA (a
pro-apoptotic bcl2 and BH3-only pro-apoptotic subclass)
and CDKN1A/p21 (pro-apoptotic and CDK2 inhibitor).
Up-regulation was also noted in genes involved in DNA
damage, G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, and in genes
implicated in DNA repair pathways such as XPA, XPC
(Nucleotide Excision Repair). A number of down-regulated
genes were involved in homologous recombination repair.
That is the case for BARD1 and BRIP1, factors associated
with BRCA1 who are needed for its activation. Moreover,
RAD51 is an essential component of HR repair and its
down-regulation could be detrimental for the cell to cope

Impaired Homologous Recombination (HR) after
PARP inhibition in PTEN deficient glioma cells
In view of the above results we tested HR efficiency
in U87MG and LN229 cell lines containing an integrated
copy of the DR-GFP reporter as previously described [26].
This reporter allows to determine the rate of HR repair of
a SceI endonuclease-generated DSB in the chromosome
by the restoration of an intact green fluorescent protein
(GFP) gene. GFP levels were quantified by KolmogorovSmirnov adjust, and revealed that LN229 cells expressed
higher levels of GFP after transfection, indicating that
PTEN mutant cells are compromised in Homologous
Recombination, as has been previously reported [20].
Moreover, PARP inhibition further disabled HR, mainly
in PTEN mutant cells where we found this repair pathway
profoundly down-regulated after the PARPi treatment
(figure 3A).
To confirm the previous results of PARPi inducing
increased HR deficiency specifically in PTEN mutant
cells, we performed an assay to quantify RAD51 foci,
which is also used to assess HR efficiency. First we
observed that RAD51 accumulation in U87MG cells did
not correlate with the level of DNA damage and did not
fluctuate in parallel to γH2AX levels (figure S5A). On the
contrary, RAD51 levels in LN229 raised in parallel with
γH2AX levels and these foci were resolved following
24 hours after irradiation. These results suggested that
PTEN wild type cells, but not PTEN mutant cells, were
able to couple HR activation with DNA damage levels. In
addition, γH2AX basal levels are much lower in U87MG
cells, further confirming the perturbed status of the HR
signalling that makes them unable to properly signal and
resolve DNA damage (figure S5B).
Consistently, assessing only cell bearing γH2AX
foci, we observed that IR-induced accumulation of
RAD51 foci was notably reduced in PTEN mutant cells
(figure 3B) and co-treatment with PJ34 further decreased
RAD51 foci formation in these cells, supporting the above
results obtained with DR-GFP transfection assay. The
levels of RAD51 were rapidly down-regulated in U87MG,
but not in LN229 where they only decreased after 48 hours
of PARP inhibition. PARP-1 silencing, however, affected
similarly to RAD51 levels irrespective of the PTEN-status
(figure 3C). Similar results were obtained using the PARPi
olaparib (figure S4C). Levels of BRCA1 protein were also
reduced in PTEN deficient cells (figure 3C). To further
confirm the association between RAD51 decrease, PARPi
treatment and PTEN status, we silenced PTEN in LN229
and we found a decrease in RAD51 levels (figure 3D);
on the other hand, restoring PTEN in U87MG cells led

with DNA damage leading to cell death. Chk1, involved
in cell cycle arrest after activation of ATM and ATR in
response to DNA damage, is also down-regulated as
well as the protein phosphatases CDC25A (which is a
Chk1 substrate) and CDC25C, involved respectively in
G1/S checkpoint and mitosis entry. Gene expression for
exonuclease Exo1, that plays a role in mismatch repair,
and the endonuclease FEN1, that removes 5’ overhanging
flaps in DNA repair and processes the 5’ ends of Okazaki
fragments in lagging strand DNA synthesis, is repressed
after PARP inhibition. Mutations or deficiency in the
Fanconi anemia complementation (FANC) group
members is characterized by cytogenetic instability,
hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased
chromosomal breakage, and defective DNA repair.
FANCG gene expression was also down-regulated after
PARP inhibition. Phosphorylation of H2AX is involved
in the initial early steps of DNA damage response, in the
recognition of double strand breaks. Down-regulation of
γH2AX is reflecting a strong defective signalling in the
initial sensing of DNA lesions. Globally, this perturbation
in DNA damage response factors after PARP inhibition

glioma cells

to a delay in RAD51 down-regulation after the treatment
(figure 3D).
As we described above, the expression of the
SAC regulatory factor BUBR1 was reduced after PARPi
treatment in PTEN mutant cells (figure 2A). To better
understand the association between BUBR1 downregulation and impaired HR we knocked-down BUBR1
in PTEN proficient cells and we observed a recovery in
RAD51 following PARP inhibition (figure 3E). This
apparently paradoxical result might be explained because
PARP inhibition, in siBUBR1 cells, is acting in a BUBR1
deficient scenario since the beginning, contrary to the
situation on U87MG cells. RAD51 recovery might reflect
a compensatory mechanism initiated by the cell to avoid
massive DNA damage in the absence of an efficient
mitotic checkpoint.

In spite U87MG glioma cells are not mutant for
EGFR, they constitutively activate MAP kinase pathway in
virtue of mutations affecting Focal Adhesion Kinases and
GRP3 [27, 28]. PARP inhibition did not prevent ERK1/2
activation making this treatment only partially effective in
suppressing this proliferative pathway. We reasoned that
avoiding signalling arising from EGFR might deregulate
the activation of MAP kinase pathway and potentiate the
effect of PARP inhibition. While treatment with EGFR
inhibitor erlotinib alone prevented ERK1/2 activation in
LN229 cells, U87MG cells were refractory to the effect
of erlotinib (figure 4A). Interestingly, co-treatment with
PJ34 and erlotinib resulted in a complete suppression of

DISCUSSION

ERK1/2 activation (figure 4B). Nonetheless, combination
of both drugs did not further decrease the PARP inhibitorinduced cytotoxicity (Figure 4C).
The full abrogation of ERK1/2 activation prompted
us to test the in vivo efficacy of this combination. To
this end, we performed an orthotopic assay inoculating
U87MG cells that expressed luciferase allowing in vivo
visualisation of the evolution of tumour mass. While the
effect of PJ34 or erlotinib were limited separately (35 and
50% respectively), the combination of both treatments
reduced tumour growth to more than 90% after 14
days (figure 4D). Mice were sacrified after 21 days due
excessive tumour growth in vehicle treated mice; at this
time PJ34 continued to be effective as anti-tumour agent
indicating that the combined inhibition of a pro-survival
pathway (using erlotinib) together with the inactivation
of HR and the induction of genomic instability by PARP
inhibition has a synergic in vivo anti-tumour effect.

Our reduced understanding of the mechanisms
which underlie brain tumorigenesis severely limit
preventative and therapeutic options for glioblastoma
patients. The current standard treatment for GBM involves
surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (RT)
with ionising radiation, with or without concomitant
chemotherapy. Disappointingly, this regimen only
affords GBM patients a median survival benefit of 14.6
months- a 12 month improvement over resection alone.
It is important to note that radio- and chemotherapies
are, at the molecular level, based on inducing enough
DNA damage in the tumour cell to result in lethality. The
results shown in this study reflect that PARP inhibition
results in a profound alteration of genomic instability in
PTEN-deficient glioma cells affecting cell cycle, mitotic
checkpoint and homologous recombination, leading to

micronuclei formation, as hallmark of MC (Figure 5). The
protein kinase BUBR1 plays a key role in the maintenance
of chromosomal stability [29] owing to its involvement in
the formation of proper chromosome-spindle attachments.
First, BUBR1 down-regulation activates Aurora B kinase
and the kinetochore protein CENP-A, resulting in the loss
of kinetochore-microtubule attachments [30]. Second,
BUBR1 avoids sister chromatids separation in anaphase
when chromosome-spindle attachments are uncorrect,
since it is involved on the Mitotic Checkpoint (Spindle
Assembly Checkpoint or SAC) [31]. When interactions
between kinetochores and microtubules are unstable
in metaphase, BUBR1, acting together with MAD2
and BUB3, join CDC20 avoiding APC activation thus
preventing sister chromatids separation in anaphase.
Remarkably gene expression of BUB1B (the gene coding
for BUBR1) is very significantly up-regulated in GBM
patients and its expression was inversely correlated with
PTEN in short-survival patients. In line with this finding
recently it has been described that BUB1B is differentially
required for GSCs expansion in glioblastoma tumours and
genetically transformed cells that have added requirement

for BUB1B to suppress lethal consequences of altered
kinetochore [32].
In the current study we have found that Homologous
Recombination Repair deficiency in PTEN mutant glioma
cells is further disabled after PARP inhibition due in part to
RAD51 down-regulation. A previous study has shown that
PARPi down-regulates RAD51 and BRCA1 leading to HR
deficiency at times where an elevated loss of cell viability
was observed [33]. In our study, PARP inhibition leads to a
profound amplification of HR deficiency in PTEN mutant
cells already at 24 hours (figure 3C and Table 1), where no
cytotoxic effect is still appreciated (figure 1A). Moreover,
the expression pattern of key components of the DNA
damage response is strongly affected after blunting PARP
activity, (PARP-1 of other PARP family members with
poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation activity), including perturbation
of the HR machinery and other DNA repair pathways
as well as factors involved in genomic instability,
beyond affecting RAD51. PTEN restoration in U87MG
slowed RAD51 decrease, whereas PTEN silencing in
LN229 augmented RAD51 down-regulation after PARP
inhibition. Thus, we show that PTEN is involved in

Figure 5: Different effect of PARPi in GBM according to PTEN status. First, in the absence of PTEN (left pannel) PARPi

perturbs the correct segregation of chromosomes, due to BUBR1 down-regulation; secondly compromised integrity of the genomic material
occurs as consequence of the alteration of HR repair. Both situations have been well-described to induce Mitotic Catastrophe. In contrast,
in a PTEN-proficient context (right pannel) BUBR1 down-regulation is retarded allowing correct chromosome segregation in mitosis and,
secondly, HR repair is less affected. Thus, mitotic and genomic instability are reduced and mitotic catastrophe-independent cell death
pathways are activated.

the mechanism by which PARP inhibition is disabling
Homologous Recombination machinery, which should be
taken into account in a possible clinical setting.
The benefit of combining PARP inhibitors with
currently used chemotherapy has been largely reported
including the potentiating effect of PJ34 [34, 35]. Here we
also show compelling evidences that cell death pathway
by which PARP inhibition impacts on cell viability of
PTEN-deficient cells is MC. MC is a mechanism activated
following genomic instability. It senses mitotic failure
and responds to it by driving the cell to an irreversible
fate, be it apoptosis, necrosis or senescence [36, 37]. The
stimuli and perturbations that are described to trigger MC
can be divided in two groups. The first group of inducers
interfere with the faithful segregation of chromosomes in
mitosis. The second group directly affects the integrity
of the genetic material, for example DNA-damaging
agents or compromised DNA-repair pathways. Thus, in
our case, aberrant mitotic spindle organization and DNA
segregation due to BUBR1 down-regulation constitute a
“first-group inducer” of MC while impaired HR repair
due to compromised RAD51 is “second trigger” of MC.
However, in spite of the increasingly detailed description
of the mechanisms that precede and follow MC, the
molecular bridges between mitotic aberrations and cell
death are still largely elusive.
In an attempt to increase the in vivo cell killing
effect of PARP inhibition on glioma cells we ideated
(given the up-regulation of pro-survival signalling
pathways in PTEN-deficient glioma cells) the co-treatment
with an inhibitor of EGFR to disable pro-survival signals.
Although no in vitro potentiation by erlotinib of PARPinduced cytotoxic effect was observed, this combination
was very effective in the suppression of ERK1/2 activation
(figure 4B) and, more interestingly, in vivo co-treatment
was synergic in slowing-down tumour growth. This
enhanced in vivo potentiation using co-treatment of antineoplastic agents with PARP inhibitors has been already
described for different preclinical models and has been
related to the increased vascular function after inhibition
of PARP resulting in amelioration of drug availability in
the tumour milieu [38]. Moreover, besides this general
property of PARP inhibitors, the use of these compounds
takes advantage of the elevated propensity to display
genomic instability (which is related with aggressiveness
trait) of PTEN deficient glioma cells. The ultimate
mechanism underlying the synergistic effect of PARP1 and
EGFR remains to be elucidated, but one possibility is that
in specific settings inhibition of PARP with PJ34 activates
pro-survival pathways as has been shown for p38/MAPK
during osteoclast differentiation [39]. A different study has
reported that PARP inhibitors may target different kinases
in a cell-specific manner [40]. In addition to the shutdown of EGFR signalling, other combinatorial treatments
could be envisaged based on the rational knowledge of
glioma cells molecular alterations. Another broad field
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to explore is the use of PARP inhibitors to act as radiopotentiators against GBM and overcome tumour resistance
to standard radiation therapy. In summary PARP inhibitors
represent an exciting new class of antineoplasic drugs and
there may well have much wider clinical indications not
just restricted to BRCA1/2 mutant tumours but to others
where PARP inhibitor treatment enhance HR deficiency
and mitotic alterations, driving the cell towards a status of
genomic instability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture and Treatments
U87MG and U118MG PTEN mutant and LN229
PTEN wild type (wt) glioblastoma cell lines as well as
SW1783 PTEN mutant grade III astrocytoma cell line,
were cultured in Dulbeco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10 % inactive fetal bovine
serum (FBSi, Gibco Invitrogen), at 37 ºC in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere.
Patient-derived Glioma Stem Cell TG1 was obtained
as described previously [41] and maintained in DMEM/
F12 plus N2, G5 and B27 (Invitrogen) at 37 ºC in a
humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
PARP inhibitors PJ34 (Alexis Biochemicals) and
AZD2281/olaparib (Deltaclon) were used. Olaparib was
dissolved in DMSO and PJ34 was dissolved in water.
Both were stored at -20ºC. Cells were treated with 10 μM
olaparib or 10 to 20 μM PJ34 during 24, 48 or 72 hours.
Temozolomide (T2577-25MG Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, USA) was dissolved in DMSO and stored at -20ºC.
Cells were treated with 100 μM Temozolomide during 24,
48 or 72 hours.

Viability Assays
Viability decrease was determined using MTT and
Propidium Iodide. For MTT (3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl Tetrazolium Bromide) assay, cells were
plated in 96 wells at a density of 8 x 103 cells. MTT assay
was performed using Cell Proliferation Kit I (MTT, 1-65007, Roche, Mh Germany) following manufacturer’s
instructions. Global cell death assay was performed with
Trypan Blue (Fluka analytical, 93595). Cells were plated
in 24 wells at a density of 2 x 104 cells. One week after
the treatment cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS
and stained with Trypan Blue . Finally, cells were placed
in a Neubauer counting chamber and counted in order to
check the rate of blue cells (indicating dead cells) in the
population.

Neurosphere Formation Assay

Lysis Buffer (3% SDS, 10% Glycerol, 10mM Na2HPO4
anhidro). Then cells were sonicated and 20 μl of 50%
β-mercaptoethanol - 50% Bromofenol blue were added.
The protein concentration was determined using the Lowry
assay. Proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels
and transferred onto PVDF Membrane (Biorad). The blot
was blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS1X with 0.1%
Tween-20 for 60 minutes and incubated overnight with
1% milk powder in PBS1X with 0.1% Tween-20 with
the following antibodies: anti-PARP-1(C2-10 mouse,
ALEXIS, LA), anti-PTEN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc7974), anti-BRCA1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-642),
anti-RAD51 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (H-92) sc-8349),
anti-phosphoERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7383),
anti-ERK (Invitrogen. Carlsbad, CA 61-7400), antiphospho H2AX (Millipore 05-636) and anti-BUBR1 (BD
Bioscience. Erembodegem, Belgium). α-Tubulin (Sigma,
St Louis MO) and β-Actin (Sigma, St Louis MO) were
used as loading control. Bands were visualized with ECL,
ECL-PLUS and ECL PRIME (Amersham Biosciences)
and the pictures were taken with the imaging system
ChemiDoc XRS System (BIO-RAD) and medical X-ray
films (AGFA).

GSCs were dissociated by up-and-down pipetting
and plated in 48 wells. PARP inhibitor was added every
24 hours during the three first days of experiment [41].
GSCs were dissociated every day in order to check their
ability to form seconday neurospheres at the end of the
experiment. The 7th day, counts were blindly performed on
10 fields of view, and the mean number of neurospheres
per field of view was calculated.

Cell Cycle Assay
Cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry [42].
Cells were plated in 6 wells at a density of 1.5 x 105
cells. After the treatments, cells were trypsinized, washed
with PBS, permeabilized with 70% ice cold ethanol,
washed again with PBS and incubated with propidium
iodide and 100 μg/ml RNAase A (Ribonuclease A from
bovine pancreas R6513-10MG Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
USA) for 20 min. When GFP population was examined,
cell fixation before permeabilization was required, as
previously described by Lamm et al [42]. Cells were
analysed on a FACScan using CellQuest software, and
cell cycle was determined using FlowJo software. In
the case of PTEN overexpression, GFP population was
gated in order to analyze cell cycle in a 100% transfected
population.

RNA interference
Cells were plated in 6 wells at a density of 9 x 104
cells per well. 24 hours later, cells were transfected with
the indicated siRNAs at 50 nM using Lipofectamine
2000 transfection agent (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s guide. Double-stranded RNA
duplexes corresponding to a non-targeted control (5’–
CCUACAUCCCGAUCGAUGAUGUU-3’),
PTEN
(5´-GCUACCUGUUAAAGAAUCA-3´) and BUBR1
(5´- CGGGCAUUUGAAUAUGAAA-3´) were ordered to
SIGMA-ALDRICH, and double-stranded RNA duplexes
corresponding to human PARP-1 were from Ambion
Applied Biosystems. 48 hours after transfection, cells
were treated with PARP inhibitors as indicated above.

Apoptosis Assays
Apoptosis was determined by different methods.
a) Cell Cycle Assay: Sub G1 population was determined
through Cell Cycle assay, as described above. b) Pyknotic
nuclei: Cells were plated in 6 wells at a density of 5 x
104 cells per well. 72 hours after the treatments cells
were fixed in Paraformaldehyde (4%, wt/vol in PBS1x
with 2% Sucrose) for 10 minutes at room temperature
and incubated with DAPI for 10 minutes. The number of
cells with nuclear apoptotic morphology was determined
using a Zeiss Fluorescence Microscope. c) Caspase 3/7
activity: Cells were plated in 96 wells at a density of
6 x 103 cells per well. Following the treatments, The
Caspase - Glo reagent (Promega) was added directly to
cells and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes
before recording luminiscence in a TECAN infinite 200
Luminometer. Each point represents the average of 3 wells
per condition to 3 independent experiments.

PTEN restoration
Cells were plated in 6 wells at a density of 1 x 105
cells per well. 24 hours later, transfection was performed
with 0,5 μg pSG5L Flag HA Plasmid, pSG5L Myr HA
PTEN Plasmid, GFP-PTEN Plasmid or pCDNA3GFP Plasmid (all from Addgene), using JetPRIME TM
(Polyplus transfection, Illkirch, France) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were treated 48 hours after
the transfection and harvested following the treatment in
order to develop Cell Cycle and Western Blot analysis.

Western Blot Analysis
Cells were plated in 6 wells at a density of 2 x 105
cells per well. After PARP inhibition, cells were washed
twice with PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of TR3

foci to get the fraction of γH2AX positive cells bearing
Rad51 foci. Alt least 120 cells from three independent
experiments were counted using Image J software.

Cells were plated in 12 wells at a density of 2,5 x
104 cells per well on glass cover-slips. After the treatments
cells were fixed with Paraformaldehyde Solution (4%, wt/
vol in PBS1x with 2% Sucrose) for 10 minutes at room
temperature and permeabilized with PBS 1X 0,5% Triton
x100 for 5 minutes at room temperature. phospho-H2AX
was detected by immunofluorescence, using monoclonal
antibody (Millipore 05-636) at a dilution 1:250 and
FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin
(Sigma, St Louis Mo) at a dilution 1:400. RAD51 foci
were detected using rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody (H92 Santa Cruz) 1:100 and FITC-conjugated goat antirabbit 1:400. Nuclear counterstaining with DAPI was
performed after removal of excess secondary antibody.
Immunostaining was visualized with Confocal Leica LCS
SP5 Fluorescence Microscope.

Micronucleus assay
DAPI counterstain described for pyknotic
nuclei quantification was also used in order to analyse
micronuclei frequency after PARP inhibition. Micronuclei
counting was performed using Image J software.

DNA repair microarray
Cells were plated in p60 at a density of 1 x
106 cells. RNA extraction was performed 24 hours
after PJ34 treatment, with RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen).
Retrotranscription was developed with RT2 First Strand
kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was tested by RT2 Profiler
PCR Array - Human DNA Damage Signalling Pathway
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer´s protocol. Data
were analysed by the ΔΔCt method.

Homologous Recombination Assay
U87MG and LN229 glioma cells were stably
transfected with a pDR-GFP plasmid containing a mutated
GFP gene with an 18 bp SceI site and were maintained
under puromycin selection before use. Transient
transfection of SceI in both cell lines creates a DSB at
the relevant site in the integrated GFP gene. Homologous
recombination repair (HRR) of this break restores GFP
gene expression [26].
Cells were plated in 6 wells at a density of 9 x 104
cells per well for stable transfection with DR-GFP. 24
hours later, cells were transfected with 1 μg DR-GFP
plasmid per well using JetPEI TM (Polyplus transfection,
Illkirch, France), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Transfected cells were maintained under puromycin
selection, and transfection was proved by PCR with the
primers
DRGFP1 5´AGGGCGGGGTTCGGCTTCTGG 3´
DRGFP2 5´CCTTCGGGCATGGCGGACTTGA 3´
For the transient transfection with SceI, cells were
plated in 6 wells at a density of 9 x 104 cells per well. 24
hours later, cells were transfected with 4 μg SceI plasmid
per well using JetPRIMETM (Polyplus transfection,
Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
24 hours after the transfection, cells were treated with
PJ34 hours during 48 hours. Finally, cells were trypsinized
and percentage of GFP expressing cells was measured by
flow cytometry on a FACScan.
Frequency of recombination events was calculated
as mean percentage of GFP positive cells transfected with
SceI divided by mean percentage of GFP positive cells
transfected with pEGFP. Results were represented through
Kolmogorov-Smirnov adjust using CellQuest software.
Additionally, homologous recombination was
indirectly evaluated by the number of cells with rad51

Thirteen-weeks-old male Balb/cnu/nu mice (Charles
River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) were
injected intracraneally with U87MG-luc cells (1x105)
by introducing stereotactically the needle of a Hamilton
syringe. The day after injection of tumour cells mice were
treated three times per week mice with PJ34 at a dose
of 10mg/kg body weight and/or erlotinib at a dose of 50
mg/kg body weight injected intraperitoneally. Sodium
Chloride solution/60% DMSO was used as vehicle. In
order to develop in vivo bioluminiscence measurement,
mice were injected intraperitoneally with D-luciferin
solution dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at a dose
of 150 mg/kg body weight. After 5 minutes, the animals
were anesthetized in the dark chamber using 3% isoflurane
in air at 1.5 L/min and O2 at 0.2 L/min/mouse, and
animals were imaged in a chamber connected to a camera
(IVIS, Xenogen, Alameda, CA). The quantification of light
emission was performed in photons/second/cm2/steradian
using Living Image 2.6.1 software (Xenogen). Tumour
growth was monitored at 0, 2, 8, 15 and 21 days by in
vivo imaging and bioluminiscence measurement. After
21 days, mice were sacrificed, and brains were dissected
and placed in Petri dishes with D-luciferin solution at a
dose of 20μg/ml. Ex vivo quantification of light emission
was performed by introducing the petri dishes inside the
chamber connected to IVIS as explained before.
