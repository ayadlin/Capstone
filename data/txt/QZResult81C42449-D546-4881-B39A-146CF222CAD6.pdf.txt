Abstract
Pancreatic cancers with aberrant expression of macrophage
migration inhibitory factor (MIF) are particularly aggressive. To
identify key signaling pathways that drive disease aggressiveness
in tumors with high MIF expression, we analyzed the expression
of coding and noncoding genes in high and low MIF-expressing
tumors in multiple cohorts of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) patients. The key genes and pathways identiﬁed were
linked to patient survival and were mechanistically, functionally,
and clinically characterized using cell lines, a genetically engineered mouse model, and PDAC patient cohorts. Here, we report
evidence of a novel MIF-driven signaling pathway that inhibits the
orphan nuclear receptor NR3C2, a previously undescribed tumor
suppressor that impacts aggressiveness and survival in PDAC.
Mechanistically, MIF upregulated miR-301b that targeted NR3C2

and suppressed its expression. PDAC tumors expressing high
levels of MIF displayed elevated levels of miR-301b and reduced
levels of NR3C2. In addition, reduced levels of NR3C2 expression
correlated with poorer survival in multiple independent cohorts
of PDAC patients. Functional analysis showed that NR3C2 inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and enhanced sensitivity to the gemcitabine, a chemotherapeutic drug used in
PDAC standard of care. Furthermore, genetic deletion of MIF
disrupted a MIF–mir-301b–NR3C2 signaling axis, reducing
metastasis and prolonging survival in a genetically engineered
mouse model of PDAC. Taken together, our results offer a
preclinical proof of principle for candidate therapies to target a
newly described MIF–miR-301b–NR3C2 signaling axis for
PDAC management. Cancer Res; 76(13); 3838–50. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

disease and are refractory to the available treatments. Therefore,
identiﬁcation of novel therapeutic targets and accelerated assessment of their clinical relevance are desperately needed to improve
outcome.
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinﬂammatory cytokine and was initially characterized as a key
regulator of innate immune response (2, 3). However, recent
investigations have described the presence of a high level of
MIF in tumors and provided evidence indicating a role of MIF
in human cancer (4, 5). A high level of MIF is found in tumors
from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients (6,
7). MIF-overexpressing tumors are highly aggressive and an
elevated MIF in pancreatic tumors predicted poor survival in
patients with PDAC, indicating its potential biologic relevance
in disease aggressiveness (7). MIF is produced by a variety of
cell type, including immune, inﬂammatory, and epithelial
cells, and can either bind to the cell surface receptor CD74
and CD44 or enter through endocytosis (2, 8, 9). In addition,
tumor cells itself secrete high levels of MIF and thus induce
protumorigenic signaling pathway through its autocrine function (10). One of the mechanisms for the enhanced intratumoral expression of MIF in malignant cells is its stabilization
by HSP90 chaperone complex by protecting it from degradation (11). On the basis of the evidence involving MIF in
immune regulation and its association with tumor progression, it is hypothesized that MIF is a molecular link between

MIF–miR-301b–NR3C2 Axis in PDAC Aggressiveness

inﬂammation and cancer (5, 12). However, the exact mechanism is not clear.
Here, we comprehensively investigated the role of MIF in
pancreatic cancer progression by applying an integrative analysis
of coding and noncoding genes in tumor biology. On the basis of
the analysis of multiple independent cohorts of human PDAC, we
identiﬁed key characteristics of tumors with aberrantly high MIF
expression that link these tumors to enhanced disease aggressiveness and mortality. We also performed functional characterization using in vitro and in vivo models with clinical validation of
our ﬁndings, which led to the discovery of a novel MIF-driven
signaling pathway, involving MIF–miR-301b–NR3C2 axis with
potential therapeutic signiﬁcance in PDAC.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, human samples, and mouse model
All the cell lines used in this study were purchased from ATCC
in 2009 and were authenticated by short tandem repeat analysis
(STR) analysis in 2015.
Human primary pancreatic tumor tissues from PDAC patients
were collected at the University of Maryland Medical System at
Baltimore (Baltimore, MD) and University of Medicine (Gottingen, Germany). The characteristics of the patients in test cohort
(N ¼ 69) are described in Supplementary Table S1. Patients'
characteristics in validation cohorts (N ¼ 41, N ¼ 64), and the
cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; N ¼ 69) are shown in
Supplementary Tables S2–S4. The tissue microarray was prepared
from additional 173 PDAC cases at the Institute of Pathology,
University of Heidelberg (Heidelberg, Germany; Supplementary
Table S5). Use of clinical specimens was reviewed and permitted
by the NCI-Ofﬁce of Human Subject Research Protection
(OHSRP, Exempt# 4678) at the NIH (Bethesda, MD).
MIF-deﬁcient LSL-KrasG12D;LSL-Trp53R172H/þ;Pdx-1-Cre(MKPC)
pancreatic cancer mouse model was generated, through crossbreeding of KPC (13) and MIF knockout mice (14) with an
approved animal study protocol by Animal Care and Use
Committee at National Cancer Institute (NCI, Frederick, MD).
Microarray expression proﬁling
miRNA and mRNA expression proﬁling were performed at the
microarray core facility, NCI. The miRNA and mRNA microarray
expression data have been deposited in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information's (NCBIs) Gene Expression Omnibus
with accession numbers GSE 62498 and GSE 62452. Details are
provided in Supplementary Methods.
Cell proliferation, migration and invasion, colony formation,
and drug cytotoxicity assays.
These assays were performed using kits from various manufacturers. Details are provided in Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
Student t test was used to assess the difference in the miRNA and
mRNA expression and other endpoints including, migration and
invasion, colony-forming ability, and cell survival among different comparison groups. When more than two groups were compared, a one-way ANOVA, followed by a Scheffe multiple comparison test was used. Kaplan–Meier analysis and log-rank test
were performed to compare the difference in survival between two
groups of patients using GraphPad Prism 6.0. Pearson correlation

www.aacrjournals.org

was used for determining any correlation between the expressions
of two genes. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
miRNA proﬁling of MIF-high and MIF-low PDAC revealed
MIF-associated miRNAs with prognostic signiﬁcance
Molecular characterization of MIF-high and MIF-low tumors
was performed using miRNA proﬁling in a test cohort (N ¼ 69) of
patients with PDAC, using Nanostring nCounter miRNA Expression Array, and testing the hypothesis that MIF regulates miRNAs,
associated with tumor progression and patient survival. Stratiﬁcation of PDAC cases into MIF-high and MIF-low groups was
based on the MIF expression above the median (high) and below
the median (low) values as determined by qRT-PCR. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) of miRNA expression
proﬁle revealed distinct groupings for MIF-high and MIF-low
tumors, indicating a systematic change in global miRNA expression proﬁle by MIF in PDAC (Fig. 1A). Further analysis identiﬁed
53 differentially expressed miRNAs in MIF-high versus MIF-low
tumors and a higher expression of ﬁve of these miRNAs, miR301b, miR-15b, miR-10b, miR-93, and miR-590-5p, in MIF-high
tumors were also associated with poor survival in PDAC cases
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B; Supplementary
Table S6). Differentially expressed miRNAs in MIF-high and MIFlow tumors also included miR-200b, which is consistent with the
earlier report describing its inhibition by MIF. However, the
expression of miR-200b does not show any association with
patient survival. miRNAs, found to be both differentially
expressed in MIF-high versus MIF-low tumors, as well as associated with patient survival, were then validated by using qRT-PCR.
Expression of the above mentioned 5 miRNAs (miR-301b, miR15b, miR-10b, miR-93, and miR-590-5p), as determined by qRTPCR, and their prediction of prognosis were consistent with the
ﬁndings from array analysis (Fig. 1B and C). Furthermore, the
miRNA expression obtained by miR-array and qRT-PCR was
highly correlated (Supplementary Fig. S1C). To ensure that these
ﬁndings are not restricted to just one group of PDAC used as test
cohort, we further validated these results in an independent
validation cohort-1 (n ¼ 41; Supplementary Table S2) of PDAC.
The cases were grouped as MIF-high and MIF-low based on the
MIF expression in tumors and dichotomized based on the median
value. Expression of miR-301b was elevated in MIF-high tumors
as compared with MIF low tumors and a higher miR-301b and
miR-590-5p was also associated with poor survival, which is
consistent with the ﬁndings in the test cohort (Fig. 1D and E).
However, the expression of miR-15b, miR-10b, miR-93, and miR590-5p did not show signiﬁcant difference between MIF-high and
MIF-low groups in the validation cohort. Therefore, we continued
our investigation to examine the association between MIF and
miR-301b. Examining a panel of eight pancreatic cancer cell lines
revealed a positive correlation between MIF and miR-301b expression (r ¼ 0.67, P ¼ 0.014; Supplementary Fig. S2A). To assess a
potential MIF-mediated regulation of miR-301b, MIF expression
was knocked down using lentiviral-mediated shRNA in pancreatic
cancer cell lines, which resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in miR301b (Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C). These ﬁndings were
further conﬁrmed by a different approach involving the lentiviralmediated stable overexpression of MIF, which resulted in a
signiﬁcant increase in miR-301b expression in these pancreatic
cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2E). These ﬁndings

subjected to Kaplan–Meier analysis, gene ontology analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3A), assessment of their differential expressions
in tumors as compared with nontumor pancreas, and validation
in two separate cohorts (16, 17) in Oncomine gene expression
database. This highly stringent approach identiﬁed nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 2 (NR3C2), HLF, LMO3,
PDE3B, and CGNL1 as the most predicted target of MIF-induced
miR-301b in pancreatic cancer (Fig. 2A and B). We then validated
these putative targets by overexpressing miR-301b in Panc-1 and
Capan-2 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Overexpression of miR-301b
signiﬁcantly reduced NR3C2 expression (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Furthermore, examining 30 UTR of NR3C2 revealed two
miR-301b–binding sites in the sequence spanning 1367-1388
and 1736-1758 nucleotides with the latter found to be highly
conserved in different mammalian species (Fig. 2C). Luciferase
reporter–based activity assay showed the interaction of miR301b to 30 UTR sequence 1736-1758 of NR3C2 resulting in a
decrease of reporter activity following the expression of miR301b. Furthermore, cotransfection with anti-miR-301b
enhanced the NR3C2 luciferase reporter activity. However,
these effects were abolished by the mutation of miR-301b–
binding site (Fig. 2D; and Supplementary Fig. S3C–S3E). Consistently, the overexpression of pri-miR-301b suppressed both
mRNA and protein expression of NR3C2 in a dose-dependent
manner conﬁrming miR-301b–mediated suppression of
NR3C2 (Fig. 2E and F). We then examined whether MIF can
downregulate NR3C2 and whether this inhibition is dependent
on miR-301b. As shown in Fig. 2G, MIF overexpression significantly reduced NR3C2 mRNA and protein levels. However, the
MIF-induced suppression of NR3C2 was abolished by the
inhibition of miR-301b. Furthermore, endogenous NR3C2
expression was negatively correlated with MIF and miR-301b
in a panel of human pancreatic cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). Taken together these ﬁndings show that
MIF-induced increase in miR-301b targets and reduces NR3C2
level.
NR3C2 inhibits proliferation, colony formation, migration,
invasion, and enhances sensitivity of pancreatic cancer
cells to gemcitabine.
NR3C2 gene encodes a mineralocorticoid receptor and functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor mediating aldosterone action on salt and water balance. Interestingly, a decrease
in NR3C2 expression is associated with poor prognosis in lung
and colorectal cancer (18, 19). However, the role of NR3C2 has
not been described in pancreatic cancer. We investigated the
function of NR3C2 in pancreatic cancer by ﬁrst screening its
expression in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines. We then
generated lentiviral-mediated NR3C2-overexpressing stable pancreatic cancer cell lines, Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2, which had the
lowest endogenous NR3C2 expression (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
NR3C2 overexpression resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the
proliferation index of these cells (Fig. 3A). The effect of NR3C2 on
the growth characteristics was measured by clonogenicity assay,
which showed 50% to 75% reduction in the colony formation
(Fig. 3B). We further investigated the potential role of NR3C2 in
the mobility of tumor cells, which is essential for invasion and
metastasis. NR3C2 overexpression signiﬁcantly reduced the
migration and invasion ability of pancreatic cancer cells (Fig.
3C). Gemcitabine has been used as a ﬁrst-line standard chemotherapeutic drug against PDAC for more than a decade and

3842 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

recently is being used in combination with other compounds
with some success. Therefore, it was examined whether an
enhanced level of NR3C2 improves the sensitivity of pancreatic
cancer cells to gemcitabine. NR3C2-overexpressing cells showed a
signiﬁcant reduction in survival as compared with control cells
following gemcitabine treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
These ﬁndings were further supported by clonogenicity assay,
which showed signiﬁcantly lower colony forming ability of
NR3C2-overexpressing pancreatic cancer cells as compared
with control cells following gemcitabine treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5C). On the contrary, stable knockdown of NR3C2 in
Capan-2 cells signiﬁcantly enhanced proliferation and invasiveness, and reduced sensitivity to gemcitabine (Supplementary
Fig. S6A–S6D). Taken together, these ﬁndings support a potential
tumor-suppressive role of NR3C2 in pancreatic cancer.
NR3C2 inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
Acquiring features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) are a critical component in the ability of cancer cells to
metastasize. Inﬂammatory mediators enhance metastatic ability of pancreatic tumors and preneoplastic cells (20) and MIFoverexpressing pancreatic tumors are highly metastatic (7). To
further examine the role of NR3C2 in pancreatic cancer, we
hypothesized that NR3C2 inhibits EMT. A lower endogenous
NR3C2 expression was associated with EMT phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). We further showed that NR3C2
inhibition by lentiviral-mediated shRNA (Supplementary
Fig. S8A) resulted in the acquisition of mesenchymal features
in pancreatic cancer cells. NR3C2 inhibition led to the reduction in E-cadherin and increase in zeb1, N-cadherin, and
vimentin mRNA, and protein expression in pancreatic cancer
cell lines (Fig. 3D and E and Supplementary Fig. S8B–S8E).
These ﬁndings show that NR3C2 inhibits EMT in pancreatic
cancer cells and support its potential tumor-suppressive role in
pancreatic cancer.
MIF enhances tumor cell invasiveness by targeting NR3C2
through the upregulation of miR-301b
MIF-induced signaling leading to enhanced tumor cell aggressiveness is not clearly understood. An enhanced migration and
invasion in MIF-overexpressing stable pancreatic cancer cells were
attenuated, when miR-301b was inhibited (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S9). However, this inhibition was abrogated by
siRNA-mediated depletion of NR3C2 (Fig. 4A). These results
showed that MIF-induced migration and invasion are mediated
by targeting NR3C2 through an increase in miR-301b. We then
examined whether the MIF-induced suppression of NR3C2 and
the resulting enhancement of migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells is achieved through EMT. Pancreatic cancer cells
with stable overexpression of MIF showed a decrease in E-cadherin and increase in N-cadherin, vimentin, and zeb1 expression
(Fig. 4B). However, inhibition of miR-301b in these cells
enhanced E-cadherin and reduced the expression of N-cadherin,
vimentin, and zeb1. We then examined whether this reversion in
the expression of EMT marker proteins following miR-301b
inhibition is due to an increase in NR3C2. Suppressing both
miR-301b and NR3C2 resulted in a decrease in E-cadherin and
increase in N-cadherin, vimentin, and zeb1 expression. These
results showed that inhibition of NR3C2 by MIF through upregulation of miR-301b mediated the MIF-induced invasiveness
and EMT (Fig. 4B). We then validated these ﬁndings using a

MIF enhances tumor cell invasiveness by targeting NR3C2 through the upregulation of miR-301b. A, MIF-induced increase in tumor cell migration and invasion is
suppressed by the inhibition of miR-301b. However, the suppression of migration and invasion following miR-301b inhibition was abrogated by knocking
down NR3C2. B, MIF overexpression decreases E-cadherin and increases N-cadherin, vimentin, and zeb1 protein levels in pancreatic cancer cells. Although, miR-301b
inhibition in the MIF overexpressing cells is associated with an increase in E-cadherin, and a decrease in N-cadherin, vimentin, and zeb1, these effects were
abolished when NR3C2 was inhibited as well. C, MIF-induced increase in tumor cell invasiveness is suppressed by overexpressing NR3C2. D, the effect of MIF on the
expression of EMT-associated markers was attenuated by NR3C2.

MIF–miR-301b–NR3C2 Axis in PDAC Aggressiveness

complimentary approach of overexpressing NR3C2 in pancreatic
cancer cells with stable high expression of MIF. NR3C2 overexpression led to a decrease in MIF-induced migration and invasion (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, NR3C2 overexpression resulted in an
increase in E-cadherin and decrease in N-cadherin, vimentin, and
zeb1 (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these ﬁndings showed that MIFinduced tumor cell invasiveness and EMT involve the upregulation of miR-301b and subsequent targeting and downregulation
of NR3C2.
MIF-mediated regulation of miR-301b and NR3C2 involves
PI3K/Akt pathway
MIF activates PI3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK signaling pathways,
which plays a role in tumorigenesis (10, 21, 22). We investigated
whether the MIF-induced upregulation of miR-301b and subsequent targeting and downregulation of NR3C2 involve the activation of PI3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK signaling. Treatment of MIFoverexpressing pancreatic cancer cells with PI3K/Akt inhibitor
LY294002 resulted in the signiﬁcant decline in miR-301b and
enhancement of NR3C2 expression (Fig. 5A). However, treatment
with AZD6244, an inhibitor of MEK, did not have any effect on
miR-301b or NR3C2 expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S10).
Consistently, MIF overexpression showed an increase in the level
of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKTser473) and a decrease in NR3C2
protein level determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5B). We
then conﬁrmed whether the treatment with LY294002 inhibits
phosphorylation of AKT, and affects the expression of miR-301b
and NR3C2. LY294002-treatment of MIF-overexpressing cells
markedly reduced p-AKTser473, which resulted in a decline in
miR-301b expression and increase in mRNA and protein level
of NR3C2 (Fig. 5C–F). These in vitro ﬁndings show that MIFinduced upregulation of miR-301b and subsequent targeting and
downregulation of NR3C2 are accomplished by activation of
PI3K/Akt signaling. To validate these ﬁndings in vivo, we examined
the orthotopic pancreatic tumors that were earlier generated from
MIF-overexpressing or control human pancreatic cancer cells (7).
Examination of MIF-overexpressing orthotopic tumors showed
an elevated miR-301b and a marked decline in NR3C2 expressions as compared with control (Fig. 5G and H). Furthermore, an
elevated expression of p-AKTser473 in MIF-overexpressing tumors
conﬁrmed the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in these
tumors (Fig. 5H).
Genetic ablation of MIF disrupted MIF–miR-301b–NR3C2 axis,
enhanced survival, and reduced metastasis in KPC mouse
model of pancreatic cancer
To examine whether MIF signaling is a potential therapeutic
target in PDAC, we used a genetic strategy to target MIF in KPC
mice, a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC. Kaplan–
Meier analysis showed that MIF-deﬁcient KPC (MKPC) mice
survived signiﬁcantly longer than that of KPC mice with wildtype MIF (P < 0.0001; Fig. 6A). In addition, MKPC mice showed a
signiﬁcant reduction in metastatic burden (P < 0.01; Fig. 6B). A
majority of these metastasis occurred in liver of both KPC and
MKPC mice. Furthermore, primary tumor cells isolated from
MKPC mice showed an enhanced expression of E-cadherin and
reduced expression of vimentin, zeb1, and N-cadherin at both the
protein and mRNA levels, as compared with primary tumor cells
from KPC mice, suggesting an attenuation of EMT in MKPC
tumors (Fig. 6C–E). Next, we examined whether MIF-deﬁciency
affected MIF–miR-301b–NR3C2 signaling pathway in this pre-

www.aacrjournals.org

clinical model of PDAC. Primary tumor cells from MKPC mice
showed a reduced expression of miR-301b and an enhanced
expression of NR3C2 as compared with KPC mice (Fig. 6E and
F). In addition, IHC analysis of pancreatic tumors showed a
signiﬁcantly higher expression of NR3C2 in MKPC mice as compared with KPC mice (Fig. 6G). Taken together, these ﬁndings
provide in vivo evidence that targeting MIF–miR-301b–NR3C2
signaling pathway reduce metastasis and enhance survival in KPC
mouse model of pancreatic cancer.
Clinical validation of MIF–miR-301b–NR3C2 axis in human
pancreatic cancer
Next, we examined the relevance of MIF–miR-301b–NR3C2
axis in the disease aggressiveness in human pancreatic cancer
using multiple independent cohorts of PDAC. MIF-high tumors
showed a reduced expression of NR3C2 in test cohort (N ¼
69; Fig. 7A, panel 1). Furthermore, MIF expression in the
tumors was positively correlated with miR-301b and negatively
correlated with NR3C2 expression (Fig. 7A, panels 2 and 3). In
addition, a negative correlation was found between miR-301b
and NR3C2 expression in these tumors (Fig. 7A, panel 4).
Moreover, a lower expression of NR3C2 in tumors was associated with poorer survival of patients in this cohort (Fig. 7,
panel 5). We then validated these ﬁndings in our validation
cohort-2 (n ¼ 64; Supplementary Table S3). Adding to our
conﬁdence, all the ﬁndings in validation cohort were consistent
with the test cohort (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, a reduced NR3C2
expression was found in tumors as compared with adjacent
nontumor pancreas in both of these cohorts (Supplementary
Fig. S11A and S11B). Next, IHC analysis of TMA in a second
independent validation cohort-3 of PDAC (n ¼ 173) further
validated that a lower expression of NR3C2 is associated with
poorer patient survival (Fig. 7C and D; Supplementary Table
S5). In addition, a third validation could be achieved by
examining the gene expression proﬁle of PDAC patient cohorts
in "The Cancer Genome Atlas" (TCGA; www.cancergenome.
nih.gov). Tumors from nonmetastatic PDAC cases showed an
elevated level of NR3C2 as compared with metastatic cases in
TCGA cohort (Supplementary Fig. S12A). Furthermore, a lower
expression of NR3C2 in tumors correlated with poorer survival
of patients in this cohort as well (Supplementary Fig. S12B).
Finally, a lower expression of NR3C2 was validated in metastatic tumors as compared with primary tumors in a recently
published large gene expression dataset (GSE71729, Supplementary Fig. S12C; ref. 23). A lower expression of NR3C2 in
these tumors also predicted poorer survival (Supplementary
Fig. S12D). Taken together these ﬁndings and their multiple
validations demonstrate the clinical relevance of MIF–miR301b–NR3C2 signaling pathway in disease aggressiveness and
survival in patients with PDAC.

Discussion
Inﬂammatory mediators are critical components of pancreatic
tumor biology, and their paracrine and autocrine functions signiﬁcantly contribute to tumor progression and disease aggressiveness in patients with PDAC (20, 24). MIF was primarily
described as a proinﬂammatory cytokine; however, recent evidence of a high level of MIF expression in many tumor types and
its association with prognosis implicates it in the development
and progression of human cancer. Pancreatic tumors with an

MIF–miR-301b–NR3C2 Axis in PDAC Aggressiveness

aberrant MIF expression are highly aggressive and a higher MIF
expression is associated with poorer survival in patients with
PDAC (7). Recently, exosomal-MIF is linked with the formation
of premetastatic niche in liver and described as a potential
biomarker of liver metastasis in PDAC (25). In this study, we
performed molecular characterization of MIF-high and MIF-low
pancreatic tumors to examine the underlying mechanism of the
highly aggressive behavior of pancreatic tumors with an aberrantly higher MIF expression in patients with PDAC, by applying an
integrative analysis of coding and noncoding gene expression
proﬁles. Our ﬁndings demonstrated that a novel MIF–miR-301b–
NR3C2 signaling pathway is a key driver of disease aggressiveness
and may be therapeutically targeted to improve survival in PDAC.
Several proinﬂammatory cytokines regulate miRNAs that are
associated with the development and progression of human
cancer, which may constitute one of the mechanisms underlying the role of cytokines in tumorigenesis (26). On the basis
of this premise, we hypothesized that MIF regulates miRNAs,
associated with tumor progression and disease aggressiveness
in PDAC. The presence of an elevated level of miR-301b in
MIF-high tumors as compared with MIF-low tumors in this
study suggested a potential regulation of miR-301b by MIF in
patients with PDAC, which was then conﬁrmed through overexpression or depletion of MIF in genetically engineered pancreatic cancer cell lines and MIF-overexpressing orthotopic
tumors, showing that MIF induces the upregulation of miR301b and is mediated through the activation of PI3K/Akt
pathway. MIF has been earlier shown to activate PI3K/Akt and
ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. However, inhibition of ERK/
MAPK signaling did not have any effect on MIF-induced
increase in miR-301b (Supplementary Fig. S10) in pancreatic
cancer cells. miR-301b overexpression enhances migration and
invasion in pancreatic cancer cell lines (27). However, its
implication in disease outcome in patients with PDAC is not
described. An association between the enhanced miR-301b
expression and poorer survival in multiple independent
cohorts of PDAC patients analyzed in our study suggested that
MIF-induced upregulation of miR-301b may contribute to
enhanced disease aggressiveness.
Several miRNAs are implicated in the development and
progression of pancreatic cancer (28). The aberrant expression
of these miRNAs alters the expression of critical target genes
responsible for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Our comprehensive analyses to identify the key target of MIF-induced
miR-301b, which mechanistically enhances pancreatic tumor
progression and disease aggressiveness, resulted in the discovery of NR3C2. NR3C2 is a mineralocorticoid receptor gene
encoding mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which functions as
a transcription factor and plays a crucial role in regulating
electrolyte balance (29). Interestingly, a lower expression of
MR predicted poor prognosis in lung and colon cancer patients
(18, 19). To our knowledge, the role of NR3C2 has not been
described in pancreatic cancer. The discovery and validation of
NR3C2 as a novel target of MIF signaling, and the poorer
survival of patients with a lower expression of NR3C2 in
tumors from multiple independent cohorts in our study,
suggested its potential tumor-suppressive role in PDAC. The
functional role of NR3C2 in tumorigenesis is not clear. An
association between lower NR3C2 expression and increased
angiogenesis has been described in colon cancer (19). EMT is a
critical event in the progression of pancreatic cancer. In a recent

www.aacrjournals.org

study, ataxia telangiectasia group D complementing gene
(ATDC)-induced EMT critically led to the acquisition of invasive phenotype in KRAS-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis
(30). The mechanistic and functional characterization of
NR3C2 in our study revealed, for the ﬁrst time, that it inhibits
EMT and signiﬁcantly reduced the metastatic potential of
pancreatic cancer cells. These ﬁndings are consistent with a
potential tumor-suppressive role of NR3C2 in pancreatic cancer. Consistently, we found that genetic deletion of MIF
enhanced NR3C2 expression, reduced metastasis, and significantly prolonged survival in genetically engineered KPC
mouse model of PDAC (Fig. 6). Aligned with these ﬁndings,
a positive correlation between MIF and miR-301b, and negative correlations between MIF and NR3C2, and also NR3C2
and miR-301b expressions in human PDAC provided a clinical
validation of MIF–miR-301b–NR3C2 axis, which enhances
disease aggressiveness in these patients (Fig. 7E). Collectively,
these data suggest that MIF-induced signaling pathway leading
to the inhibition of NR3C2 is a key driver of disease aggressiveness in patients with PDAC.
Taken together, the ﬁndings in this study revealed a novel MIFdriven signaling pathway, which mechanistically links MIF-high
tumors to enhanced disease aggressiveness and mortality, and
also provide proof-of-principle that therapies targeting MIF–miR301b–NR3C2 axis may improve disease outcome in patients with
PDAC.
