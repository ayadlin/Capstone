Abstract
The cytosolic quinone oxidoreductases NQO1 and NQO2 protect cells against oxidative stress by detoxifying
quinones and preventing redox cycling. In this study, we used double knockout (DKO) mice deficient for NQO1
and NQO2 to investigate the role of these antioxidative enzymes in a two-stage model of inflammatory skin
carcinogenesis. In this model, tumors are caused by exposure to topical carcinogen dimethylbenz(a)anthracene or benzo(a)pyrene (BP) followed by twice weekly application of proinflammatory phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate. On this classic chemical carcinogenesis protocol, DKO mice showed a significantly higher skin
tumor frequency and multiplicity compared with control wild-type or single knockout mice. Analysis of skin
from wild-type and DKO mice exposed to BP for 6, 12, or 24 hours revealed a relative delay in the activation of
p53, p63, p19ARF, and apoptosis in DKO mice, consistent with a negative modifier role for NQO1/NQO2 in
carcinogenesis. Our findings offer genetic evidence of the significance of quinone oxidoreductases NQO1 and
NQO2 in limiting chemical skin carcinogenesis. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1006–14. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and benzo(a)pyrene (BP)
are known environmental contaminants. They are present
in tobacco smoke and motor vehicle exhaust and produced
during burning of carbohydrates, fat, and protein (1, 2).
DMBA and BP both are recognized mutagens and carcinogens in human and rodents (2, 3). The incidence of skin cancer is equivalent to the incidence of malignancies in all other
organs combined and thus represents a major, and growing,
public health problem (4).
Dicoumarol-sensitive NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase
(NQO1) is a flavoprotein that catalyzes metabolic detoxification of quinones, leading to protection against oxidative
stress (5). However, NQO1 in many instances has been reported to activate drugs, leading to cell death (5). NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) is a second member of the
quinone oxidoreductases (5). The cofactor requirement for
activity is very selective, requiring NAD(P)H for NQO1 and
dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH) for NQO2 (6, 7). NQO2
is inhibited by flavones such as quercetin (6) and BP (7). Although overlapping substrate specificities have been observed for NQO1 and NQO2, such as for CB1954 activation,

significant differences exist in relative affinities for the various substrates (6–8).
NQO1−/− and NQO2−/− mice were generated (9, 10). The
mice were born normal but showed altered intracellular redox
status; altered metabolism of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and
nucleotides; and reduced accumulation of abdominal fat with
age (11). The studies also showed that disruption of the NQO1
gene in mice led to myelogenous hyperplasia of bone marrow
and increased sensitivity of NQO1−/− mice to menadioneinduced hepatic damage (12). Similar to NQO1 −/− mice,
myeloid hyperplasia of bone marrow was detected in
NQO2−/− mice (10). NQO1−/− and NQO2−/− mice also showed
increased sensitivity to skin carcinogenesis in response to BP
and DMBA (13–16).
The human NQO1 and NQO2 genes are precisely located
on chromosomes 16q22 and 6p25, respectively (17). The
C-T polymorphism in the human NQO1 gene produces a proline to serine (P187S) substitution that inactivates the enzyme (18). NQO1P187S is associated with greater risk of
neutropenia in benzene-exposed adult Chinese workers (19)
and is significantly overexpressed in therapy-related and
de novo leukemias in adults (20). The human NQO2 gene
locus is highly polymorphic (17, 21, 22). Among these, a
29-bp insertion/deletion promoter polymorphism associated
with altered expression of the NQO2 gene and Parkinson disease is especially notable (23, 24). The studies have shown
that a substantial number of human individuals carrying mutations in both NQO1 and NQO2 genes have reduced levels of
these enzymes (25). The susceptibility of these individuals to
diseases remains unknown (25).
The development of skin cancer is a multistage process
that includes initiation, promotion, and progression in experimental animal models and induction and propagation possibly in human cancer (26). To examine the combined in vivo

role of NQO1 and NQO2, double knockout (DKO) NQO1−/−
NQO2−/− mice were generated by cross-breeding NQO1−/−
mice with NQO2−/− mice (25). DKO mice showed significantly
higher sensitivity to DMBA- and BP-induced skin carcinogenesis, especially tumor multiplicity, as compared with wildtype (WT) and individual knockout mice. The results also
suggest that delayed activation of p63/p53/p19 and decreased apoptosis contributed to increase in skin tumors in
DKO mice. The results together suggest that NQO1 and
NQO2 combined protect against DMBA- and BP-induced
skin carcinogenesis.

Materials and Methods
WT and DKO mice. C57BL/6 NQO1−/−, NQO2−/−, and DKO
NQO1−/−/NQO2−/− mice were generated in our laboratory.
The WT and DKO mice were housed in polycarbonate cages
in the animal facility at the University of Maryland (Baltimore,
MD). The mice were kept in an air-conditioned barrier facility at a temperature of 24 ± 2°C and a humidity of 55 ±
5% with a 12:12 light-dark cycle. Mice were fed standard rodent chow and acidified tap water ad libitum. Six- to 8-wkold mice were used for the experiments in this study.
The University of Maryland Baltimore Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the study and safety
protocol. The animals received humane care throughout
the experiment.
DMBA- and BP-induced skin carcinogenesis. Six- to 8wk-old C57BL/6 WT and DKO mice deficient in NQO1 and
NQO2 were used. The lower backs of mice were shaved using
hair clippers. Twenty to 24 mice (half male and half female)
were used in each group. The various concentrations of
DMBA (200, 400, and 600 nmol) or 800 nmol of BP in acetone
were applied on mice skin 2 d after shaving. The control mice
received acetone alone. This was followed by twice-weekly
applications of 10 μg phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) for 20 wk starting at 1 wk after DMBA treatment.
Five NQO1−/− and five NQO2−/− mice were included in each
group for comparison with DKO mice. Mice were observed
weekly for development of skin tumors. Skin tumor formation was recorded weekly, and tumors >1 mm in diameter were included in the cumulative total if they persisted
for >2 wk.
Histologic examination of DMBA- and BP-induced skin
tumors. Mice were sacrificed if moribund, or any individual
tumor reached a diameter of 4 mm, or at the termination of
the experiment (30th week). The skin tumor specimens were
collected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin overnight and
embedded in paraffin, sectioned at ∼4 μm, and stained with
H&E. Diagnostic criteria for skin tumors were based on expert pathologist reports and the available literature (26). Pathology of tumours in laboratory animals, volume 2—tumours
of the mouse (27) was also consulted. Histopathologic lesions
of the skin epidermal tumors were classified into squamous
cell papilloma, keratoacanthoma, squamous cell carcinoma,
and basal cell tumor.
Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis of

DKO mice were used. The lower backs of the skin were
shaved using hair clippers. Two days later, acetone and 800
nmol of BP dissolved in 100 μL acetone were applied on the
shaved mice skin. The control mice received acetone only.
Six, 12, 24, and 48 h later, WT and DKO mice were euthanized. Skin samples were removed by surgery.
A portion of skin tissue was used for immunohistochemical analysis. The skin tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin overnight and embedded in paraffin and sectioned at
∼4 μm. The skin slides for short-term study were deparaffinized in xylenes and rehydrated in graded alcohol and PBS
followed by immunohistochemical analysis with Immunoperoxidase Secondary Detection System (Chemicon). Briefly, endogenous peroxidase was quenched by treatment of skin
sections with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. The slides
were heated in a boiled 0.01 mol/L citrated buffer (pH 6.0;
BD Biosciences) by a microwave oven for 3 min to unmask
antigen. Tissue sections were blocked with blocking reagent
containing 5% normal goat serum for 30 min. After blocking,
rabbit anti-mouse p53 (diluted 1:500; CM5p; Novocastra Laboratories), p63 (4A4; 1:1,000), Bax (P-19; 1:50), Bcl2 (N-19; 1:50;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), caspase-3 (1:250; Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; 1:50;
Sigma Chemical Co.) were added and incubated overnight
at 4°C in a humid chamber. The slides were washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary
antibody (30 min). This was followed by washing of slides
and incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) reagents
(15 min). Then, the slides were exposed to 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. For nuclear staining of p53 and p63, positive cells were
examined, photographed, and counted from 15 different
fields from three mice.
The remaining skin tissues were homogenized in an icecold buffer containing 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5%
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% Triton X-100 in 50
mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4) and a mixture of protease inhibitors
including 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L
DTT, 1 μg/mL pepstatin, aprotinin, leupeptin, and antipain
(all from Sigma Chemical). Skin protein samples (50–100 μg)
were separated on 10% to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antibodies
against NQO1 (diluted 1:1,000; generated from our laboratory); NQO2 (N-15; 1:250), p53 (DO-1; 1:1,000), c-Jun (H-79;
1:250), Bcl2 (N-19; 1:500), Bax (P-19; 1:500), and p19 (E-11;
1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); p21 (1:1,000) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; 1:1,000; BD Biosciences);
caspase-3 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology); anti–poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) p85 fragment polyclonal
antibody (1:250; Promega); and ODC (1:250) and β-actin
(1:5,000; Sigma Chemical). Immunoblots were incubated
with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (goat antimouse IgG HRP, goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP, and rabbit antigoat IgG HRP, diluted 1:2,000; Chemicon) with enhanced
chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) reagents by the procedures suggested by the manufacturer.

The DKO mice exposed to DMBA showed early onset of skin

failed to induce skin tumors. Interestingly, tumor multiplicity
in DKO mice was significantly higher than WT mouse (Fig. 1A,
right). DKO mice exposed to DMBA showed 10 to 18 tumors
per mouse as compared with average of <0.2 tumor per WT
mouse. DKO mice in two-stage carcinogenesis studies also
showed significant increase in susceptibility to BP-induced
skin carcinogenesis (Fig. 1B). DKO mice exposed to BP
showed early onset of development of skin tumors as compared with WT mice (Fig. 1B, left). The tumor incidence in
DKO mice reached 100% at week 25, but in WT mice, it only
reached 43% at week 27. The tumor multiplicities at week 27

Results
DMBA and BP induction of skin tumors in WT and DKO
mice. We performed standard two-stage initiation-promotion
experiments to study comparative susceptibility of WT and
DKO mice to DMBA- and BP-induced skin tumors. Skin tumor
incidence and tumor multiplicity were recorded (Fig. 1A and B;
Table 1). The DKO mice showed significantly higher skin
tumor incidences and multiplicity of tumors/mouse with all
three (200, 400, and 600 nmol) doses of DMBA as compared
with WT mice (Fig. 1A, left, top; Table 1). All the three doses
led to development of skin tumors in 100% of DKO mice at
week 14 after DMBA exposure (Fig. 1A, left, top). In contrast,
<10% WT mice showed DMBA-induced skin tumors at week
14 after DMBA exposure. The highest tumor incidence in WT
mice was 30%, with a maximum dose of 600 nmol DMBA.

NQO1 and NQO2 Deficiency and Chemical Carcinogenesis

A representative tumor-bearing mouse exposed to 200 nmol
DMBA is shown in Fig. 2A. The majority of the tumors that
developed in the DKO mice were 4 mm in diameter, in contrast
to the 1 mm or less size distribution observed in the WT population. Histologic evaluation of DMBA- and BP-induced skin
tumors in WT and DKO mice showed that most tumors were
typical exophytic, well-differentiated squamous cell papillomas. DKO mouse exposed to DMBA also showed a few squamous cell carcinomas as shown in Fig. 2B. The squamous cell
carcinoma was not observed in WT mice treated with DMBA.
NQO1 and NQO2 single knockout mice exposed to DMBA
and BP are known to develop low frequency of skin tumors
as compared with WT mice (Fig. 2C; refs. 13–16). A comparison of DMBA- and BP-induced skin tumors and tumor multiplicities in DKO mice with WT, NQO1−/−, and NQO2−/− mice
is plotted in Fig. 2C and D. DMBA exposure led to almost
similar incidence of skin tumors in individual NQO1 and
NQO2 knockout and DKO mice that were significantly higher
than WT mice (Fig. 2C). However, BP treatment showed significantly higher incidence of tumors in DKO mice as compared with not only WT but also individual NQO1 and NQO2
knockout mice (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1C). Intriguingly, highly significant differences between DKO and individual NQO1 and
NQO2 knockout mice exposed to DMBA and BP were observed in tumor multiplicity (Fig. 2D). DKO mice exposed
to DMBA developed 10 to 18 tumors per mouse as compared
with 3 to 4 tumors per NQO1−/− and NQO2−/− mouse. Similarly,
the exposure to BP led to four or more tumors in DKO mouse as
compared with a single tumor in NQO1−/− and NQO2−/− mice.
Immunohistologic analysis of growth, differentiation,
and apoptosis factors. We used WT and DKO mice exposed

to acetone (vehicle control) and BP for 6, 12, and 24 hours to
investigate the mechanism of increased susceptibility of DKO
mice to develop skin tumors in response to BP (Figs. 3–5).
The treated skin sections were analyzed for anti-p63, antip53, anti-ODC, anti-Bcl2, anti-Bax, and anti–caspase-3
antibodies by immunohistochemistry. Both p63 and p53 immunohistochemistry showed epithelial nuclear staining,
whereas ODC, Bcl2, Bax, and caspase-3 showed cytoplasmic
staining. The p63 and p53 cells with nuclear staining were
counted and plotted (Figs. 3 and 4). Interestingly, BP treatment showed time-dependent increase in p63 in WT mice
until 12 hours after exposure (Fig. 3). The p63 level dropped
to basal level at 24 hours after BP exposure in WT mice. In
contrast, DKO mice skin showed higher expression of p63
compared with WT mice and lack of induction of p63 at 6
and 12 hours after BP exposure (Fig. 3). The p63 showed
increased expression in DKO mice but only at 24 hours after
BP exposure (Fig. 3). WT mice skin showed low level of p53
staining that was absent in DKO mice (Fig. 4). WT mice
treated with BP led to time-dependent increase in p53 at
12 and 24 hours after exposure. DKO mice in the same experiment showed induction of p53 only at 24 hours after BP exposure (Fig. 4). The induction of p53 was absent in DKO mice
at 6 and 12 hours after BP exposure (Fig. 4). A comparison of
WT and DKO mouse skin from various immunohistochemical analyses showed an intriguing observation of thinning
of epithelium in DKO mice because of unknown reasons
(Fig. 5). The immunohistochemical analysis also showed increased staining for proliferation marker ODC and antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 as compared with WT mice at all
three time points of BP exposure (Fig. 5A and B). However,

BP-treated WT and DKO mice. Dorsal skin of WT and DKO mice was
exposed to acetone or 800 nmol BP. Six, 12, and 24 h after BP treatment,
the mice were euthanized and sections of treated skin were removed
by surgery. Skin samples were fixed in formalin and embedded
in paraffin, and sections were cut. Sections were analyzed by
immunohistochemistry with anti-mouse p63 antibodies. The p63-positive

Bax and caspase-3 in the same experiment showed decreased staining in DKO mice skin compared with WT mice

Western blot analysis. WT and DKO mice were exposed
to acetone (vehicle control) and BP for 6, 12, 24, and 48
hours. The mice were euthanized, skin was collected by surgery and homogenized, and total cell lysate was analyzed by
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for p53, p21, Bcl2, Bax, caspase-3, cleaved PARP, p19, c-Jun, ODC, PCNA, NQO1, NQO2,
and actin (Fig. 6). NQO1 and NQO2 were present in WT mice
but, as expected, were absent in DKO mice. The treatment
with BP first increased and then decreased NQO1 and NQO2
in WT mice. DKO mice showed lower basal expression of tumor suppressor gene p53, growth arrest gene p21, and proapoptotic gene Bax but higher expression of antiapoptotic gene
Bcl2 as compared with WT mice. The treatment with BP showed
time-dependent increase in p53, p21, Bax, and caspase-3 in WT
mice. However, the DKO mice exposed to BP showed delayed
and smaller magnitude of increase in p53, p21, Bax, and
caspase-3. In WT mice, the BP-induced skin samples showed
higher PCNA levels as compared with DKO samples. The DKO
mice also showed absence of cleaved PARP as observed in WT
mice. WT mice showed significant increase in growth suppression gene p19 in response to BP. The increase in p19 was
absent in DKO mice. The expression of proliferation-related
genes c-Jun and ODC was undetected in WT mice. However,
DKO mice in the same experiment showed time-dependent
increase in c-Jun and higher expression of ODC.

tion of DMBA- and BP-induced skin carcinogenesis. We used
DKO mice to investigate the combined role of NQO1 and NQO2
in prevention of skin carcinogenesis in response to carcinogens
DMBA and BP. These studies were significant because DKO
mice represented animal model for human individuals deficient in both NQO1 and NQO2 because of mutations in
NQO1 gene and promoter polymorphism in NQO2 gene (18–
20, 23, 24). DKO mice showed significantly higher sensitivity
to develop skin tumors in response to DMBA and BP as compared with WT and individual knockout mice. The tumors developed early and were larger in size than individual knockout
mice. One of the most intriguing observations was highly significant increase in tumor multiplicity. Most of the skin tumors
in DKO and WT mice were papillomas. However, DKO mice
showed a few carcinomas, which were absent in WT mice.
We also performed experiments to determine the mechanism of the role of NQO1/NQO2 in skin chemoprotection.
We analyzed WT and DKO mice skin exposed to BP for factors that regulate growth/differentiation, proliferation, and
apoptosis. These included p63, p53, p21, p19, Bcl2, Bax, caspase-3, c-Jun, and ODC. p63 family of factors is critical for
epidermal morphogenesis and carcinogenesis (28–30). The
p53 protein, called the guardian of the genome, represents
a key regulator of the control of cell growth against internal
and external stress through transcriptional-dependent and
transcriptional-independent mechanisms (31–33). p53 is a
tumor suppressor gene whose product can act as a suppressor of transformation (34) and is induced by DNA damage
(35). In turn, p53 orchestrates a global transcriptional response that either counters cell proliferation or induces
apoptosis (36). p21 is a critical regulator of the cell cycle,
and cell fate in epidermis (37) was also induced after BP
treatment. The accumulation of activated p53 protein induces a cell cycle arrest at the G 1 phase, which allows the

Discussion
Previously, NQO1−/− and NQO2−/− mice exposed to DMBA
and BP induced low frequency of skin tumors that was significantly higher than WT mice (13–16). This raised an interesting
question about a combined role of NQO1 and NQO2 in preven-

repair of DNA damage before its replication in the S phase. In
this pathway, p21 was discovered as an inhibitor of cyclindependent kinase (CDK), whose induction is associated
with the expression of p53 (38). p21 mediates cell cycle arrest
by binding to and inactivation of the cyclin D/CDK4, cyclin
D/CDK6, and cyclin E/CDK2 complexes (38). Upregulation
of p21 has also been documented in cells undergoing differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis, all processes that may
negatively influence tumor formation or progression (39). A
role for p21 as a downstream effector of p53-mediated tumor
suppression is supported by its ability to block proliferation of
p53-deficient tumor cells in vitro and in vivo (34). p19 suppresses growth, progression, and metastasis of tumor through
p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways (40). Loss of
p19 results in increased malignant conversion, more aggressive tumors, and frequent and rapid metastasis. However,
one in vivo p19-null mouse model indicated additional
p53-dependent tumor suppressor functions for p19 (40).
The Bcl2 family of proteins consists of proapoptotic and
antiapoptotic regulators of programmed cell death/apoptosis. The Bax gene is an apoptosis-promoting member of the
Bcl2 gene family. The Bcl2 protein is known to form hetero-

www.aacrjournals.org

dimers with the Bax protein in vivo, and the molar ratio of
Bcl2 to Bax determines whether apoptosis is induced or inhibited in target tissues (41). The Bax protein is considered
to be one of the primary targets of p53 and controls cell death
through its participation in the disruption of mitochondria
with the subsequent release of cytochrome c (41–43). Cytochrome c release, in turn, activates caspase-3, caspase-9, and
PARP (42). Cleaved PARP is regarded as a proximate mediator of apoptosis. c-Jun is known to promote cellular proliferation (44). ODC is a key enzyme in cellular polyamine
synthesis. Consequently, polyamine levels are elevated in
the skin, which creates a cellular environment that greatly
enhances tumor growth after minimal exposure to carcinogens (45). In DKO mice, the BP-induced samples showed
lower PCNA levels as compared with WT samples. PCNA is
associated with S phase of DNA replication (46). It is known
that carcinogen administration induces resistance in cells,
which can proliferate even under cytotoxic conditions as observed in BP-treated groups. The absence of normal cell proliferation activity seems to be responsible for the progression
of papilloma to squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in
DKO mice.

Figure 6. Western blot analysis. Dorsal skin of WT and DKO mice was
shaved, and 2 d later, acetone or 800 nmol BP was applied on the shaved
skin for indicated times. Skin samples from three mice in each group
were combined. Samples from all groups were homogenized and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Western blots were
probed with p53, p21, Bcl2, Bax, caspase-3, cleaved PARP, p19, c-Jun,
ODC, NQO1, NQO2, and actin antibodies.

Immunohistochemical analysis showed BP induction of
p63 in WT mice that promoted differentiation of epidermal
cells and protection against carcinogenesis. DKO mice
showed delayed induction of p63 that might have interfered
with normal process of differentiation and contributed to
skin tumor development. The isoform of p63 that contributes
to prevention of skin carcinogenesis in WT mice remains to
be determined. The lower expression and delayed activation
of tumor suppressor p53 and p19 also contributed to skin
tumor development in DKO mice. This should also explain
high occurrence of tumor multiplicity in DKO mice exposed
to BP and DMBA. In addition, the increased expression
of antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 and lack of optimal induction of tumor suppressor p53, proapoptotic protein Bax,
and caspase-3 in DKO mice in response to BP suggested
decreased apoptosis of damaged cells that also contributed
to increased tumor incidence and multiplicity in DKO mice.
This was also supported by the absence of cleaved PARP in
DKO mice. Increase in c-Jun and ODC possibly promoted cellular proliferation, leading to tumor development in DKO mice.
PAHs undergo metabolic activation to exert their carcinogenic effects (1). BP is metabolized via cytochrome P450 system into reactive BP quinones and dihydrodiol epoxide
derivatives (e.g., BP-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide). These metabolites bind covalently to DNA and form adducts, which
may lead to mutations and consequently to uncontrolled cell
growth and tumor formation in various tissues (1). DMBA is
metabolized into its ultimate carcinogen, diol epoxide, by cytochrome P450 (2). P450 reactions generate reactive oxygen

species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress that is known to play
a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cancer (47). Quinone oxidoreductases (NQO1 and NQO2) compete with cytochrome
P450 and catalyze two-electron reduction of quinone metabolites of BP to hydroquinones, thus skipping one-electron reduction and semiquinone and ROS generation (48). Unlike
BP, DMBA does not metabolically produce quinones, yet
NQO1 and NQO2 protect mice against its carcinogenicity
(14, 16). Therefore, the studies suggest that the role of NQO1
and NQO2 in protection against carcinogenicity is against all
types of chemicals and not restricted to chemicals that are
metabolized to quinones. The studies also suggest that
mechanisms of NQO1 and NQO2 protection against chemical
carcinogenesis involve not only detoxification of chemicals
but also other mechanisms because they could protect against
chemicals that are not substrates for NQO1 and NQO2.
One such mechanism of NQO1 and NQO2 protection is
their role in stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 against
20S proteasomal degradation (49). This is due to direct physical interaction of NQO1 and NQO2 with p53 and reduction/
abrogation of p53 interaction with 20S proteasomes. NQO1
and NQO2 are stress-inducible proteins and induced in response to chemical and radiation stress (49). This leads to
NQO1- and NQO2-mediated stabilization of p53 and cellular
protection. Therefore, it is possible that delayed/reduced activation of p53 in DKO mice in response to BP and DMBA treatment is due to loss of NQO1 and NQO2 stabilization of p53
against 20S degradation. NQO1 and NQO2 both were induced
in response to BP, leading to stabilization/activation of
p53 and protection against skin carcinogenesis. The role of
NQO1 and NQO2 in control of stability of other factors, including p63 and p19, is expected but remains to be determined.
In summary, the results suggested that NQO1 and NQO2
combined provide protection against chemical-induced skin
carcinogenicity. This protection is due to NQO1 and NQO2
control of factors that mediate cell growth and differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. This conclusion is significant for human individuals with combined deficiency of
NQO1 and NQO2.
