Abstract
Some tumor-suppressing miRNAs target multiple oncogenes
concurrently and therefore may be useful as cancer therapeutic
agents. Further, such miRNAs may be useful to address chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer, which remains a primary
clinical challenge in need of solutions. Thus, cytoprotective
processes upregulated in cancer cells that are resistant to chemotherapy are a logical target for investigation. Here, we report
that overexpression of miR-634 activates the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway by direct concurrent targeting of genes

associated with mitochondrial homeostasis, antiapoptosis,
antioxidant ability, and autophagy. In particular, we show how
enforced expression of miR-634 enhanced chemotherapyinduced cytotoxicity in a model of esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma, where resistance to chemotherapy remains
clinically problematic. Our ﬁndings illustrate how reversing
miR-634–mediated cytoprotective processes may offer a broadly useful approach to improving cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 75

Introduction

Mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, an intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, is usually initiated by loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential and proceeds via release of cytochrome c and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) from the intermembranous space of the
mitochondria to the cytosol (11). In the cytosol, cytochrome
c forms a complex with APAF1 and procaspase-9, and in this
complex, known as the apoptosome, an initiator caspase-9 is
activated, resulting in cleavage and activation of executioner caspases
such as caspase-3 (11). Although cancer treatment by chemotherapy
and g-irradiation kills tumor cells primarily by inducing apoptosis,
tumor cells can acquire resistance to apoptosis. Resistance to chemotherapy is a persistent problem during cancer treatment, and,
consequently, establishing a novel strategy to overcome such resistance is required for the improvement of prognosis in cancer patients
(11). Cancer cells are thought to upregulate cytoprotective processes
for their survival, including antiapoptosis, antioxidant scavenging,
and/or autophagic mechanisms; therefore, targeting these processes
may be effective in overcoming chemoresistance (11–13).
In the present study, we report that miR-634 induces activation of
the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and may play a supporting
role with chemotherapy. Overexpression of miR-634 activated the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by directly and concurrently
targeting multiple genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis
and the cytoprotective processes against apoptosis in various
cancer cells. Furthermore, the enforced expression of miR-634
markedly enhanced chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in ESCC
cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our ﬁndings suggest that concurrent
miR-634–mediated modulation of cytoprotective mechanisms
may be a therapeutically useful tool for cancer therapy.

miRNAs are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate
gene expression by interfering with the translation or stability of
target transcripts via binding to the 30 -untranslated region (UTR),
and function as a "ﬁne-tuner" of numerous biologic processes
(1–4). Dysregulated miRNA expression is associated with many
human diseases, including cancer (1–4), and downregulation of
several tumor-suppressive miRNAs has been shown to be associated with tumor progression, including cell proliferation, invasion/metastasis, and chemoresistance. We have previously identiﬁed novel tumor-suppressive miRNAs in endometrial cancer,
oral squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma (ESCC; refs. 5–10). Importantly, some tumor-suppressive miRNAs were found to simultaneously target multiple cancerpromoting genes, and may be useful as a therapeutic agent for
cancer therapy.

Induction of Mitochondrial Apoptosis by miR-634

FBS. ESCC cell lines (KYSE850, KYSE170, and KYSE150), which
were gifted by Dr. Shimada Y (Toyama University; refs. 14–16),
and human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) were cultured in
RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FBS. All cell lines were
maintained at 37 C with 5% CO2.
A total of 40 primary ESCC tumor samples and the corresponding noncancerous esophageal mucosa, obtained from patients
treated at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital from
November 2007 to October 2012, frozen immediately in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at 80 C until total RNA was extracted, were
utilized in this study. The collection and analysis of patient
samples were approved by the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Institutional Review Board (approval #2010-5-2), and
written consent was obtained from all patients.
Antibodies and reagents
For Western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence analysis, antibodies for caspase-9 (#9502), cleaved caspase-9 (#9501), caspase3 (#9662), cleaved caspase-3 (#9661), cleaved PARP (#9541),
XIAP (#2042), and BIRC5 (survivin; #2808), were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology; antibodies for b-actin (A5441), LC3B
(L7543), and TFAM (SAB1401383) were from Sigma; antibodies
for APIP (ab98153), OPA1 (ab42364), and LAMP2 (LAMP2b;
ab18529) were from Abcam; and antibodies for NRF2 (sc-13032)
and p62 (SQSTM1; sc-28359) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. z-VAD-fmk (3188-v) was purchased from Peptide Institute
Inc. and added at 100 mmol/L of ﬁnal concentration simultaneously with transfection of miRNAs, and then cells were evaluated after 48 hours of incubation. Cisplatin (CDDP) was purchased from WAKO, and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) was from Sigma,
and they were used for treatment of cultured cells at indicated
concentrations.
Transfection of miRNAs and siRNAs
The dsRNA mimicking mature human miR-634 (PM11538)
and nonspeciﬁc control miRNA (negative control #1) were
obtained from Life Technologies. The siRNA for NRF2 (M003755-02), XIAP (M-004098-01), APIP (M-008475-01), BIRC5
(M-003459-03), LAMP2 (M-011715-00), and nonspeciﬁc control
siRNAs (D-001810-05) were obtained from Thermo Scientiﬁc
Dharmacon. The siRNA for OPA1 (GUUAUCAGUCUGAGCCAGG) and TFAM (GUUGUCCAAAGAAACCUGU) was synthesized by Sigma. MiRNA or siRNA (for U2OS or HeLa cells) was
transfected individually into cells at indicated concentrations
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. For concurrent inhibition of 7
target genes, mixtures of 7 siRNAs (in total 70 nmol/L of each
10 nmol/L) or nonspeciﬁc control siRNAs (in 70 nmol/L) were
transfected into U2OS cells, respectively.
Cell survival and cell death assay
Cell survival was assessed by the crystal violet (CV) staining
assay. Cells were washed in PBS and ﬁxed with 0.1% CV in 10%
formaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes. After excess CV solution was
discarded, stained cells were completely air-dried, and then lysed
with a 2% SDS solution with shaking for 2 hours. Optical density
(OD) absorbance was measured at 560 nm using a microplate
reader (ARVOmx; Perkinelmer), and the percent absorbance of
every well was determined. The OD absorbance values of cells in
control wells were arbitrarily set at 100% to determine the

www.aacrjournals.org

percentage of viable cells. Dead cell was counted by trypan blue
staining using the TC20 Automated Cell Counter (BIO-RAD), and
the percentage of dead cells per total cells was calculated.
Determination of the sub-G1 cell population by FACS analysis
Both attached cells and cells ﬂoating in the medium were
collected, washed in PBS, and ﬁxed with 70% cold ethanol
overnight at 20 C. Fixed cells were washed in PBS again and
incubated in PBS containing RNase (250 mg/mL) for 30 minutes at
37 C. Cells were then stained with propidium iodide (Life Technologies), and cell population analysis was performed using the
Accuri Flow Cytometer.
Western blot analysis
Whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins
were transferred to PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare). After
blocking with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 5% non-fat
dry milk for 1 hour, the membrane was reacted with an antibody
overnight. The dilutions for primary antibodies were: 1/5,000 for
LC3B and b-actin, 1/2,000 for p62, and 1/1,000 for the other
antibodies. The membrane was washed and exposed to horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG antibodies (both at 1/4,000) for 2 hours. The bound antibodies were
visualized in LAS3000 (FUJIFILM) using a Pierce ECL Western
detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Detection of cytochrome c in the isolated mitochondrial fraction was performed using the Cytochrome c Releasing Apoptosis
Assay Kit (Abcam; ab65311) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Mouse monoclonal anticytochrome c antibody
(Abcam; ab65311) was used at a dilution of 1/500, and mouse
monoclonal anti-VDAC1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
sc-58649) was used at a dilution of 1/1,000 as a control for the
mitochondrial fraction.
Conventional luciferase assay
Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by inserting the
30 -untranslated region (UTR) of XIAP, BIRC5, APIP, OPA1, TFAM,
or LAMP2 downstream of the luciferase gene within the pmirGLO
dual-luciferase miRNA target expression vector (Promega). All
site-speciﬁc mutations were generated using the GeneTailor sitedirected mutagenesis system (Life Technologies). Luciferase
reporter plasmids and a pTK plasmid as an internal control were
cotransfected in U2OS cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and after
5 hours, 20 nmol/L of miRNA (miR-NC or miR-634) was also
transfected. At 36 hours after transfection of miRNAs, Fireﬂy
and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the dualluciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and relative luciferase
activity was calculated by normalizing Fireﬂy luciferase by its
corresponding internal Renilla luciferase control.
Gene expression array analysis
For gene expression analysis, the Agilent 4  44 K (for HeLa
cells) or 8  60 K (U2OS and KYSE850 cells) array was used
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies). HeLa, U2OS, and KYSE850 cells were transfected with
20 nmol/L of miRNA (miR-NC or miR-634), and RNA was
extracted at 48 hours after transfection. Each experiment was
performed in duplicate, and the data were analyzed in GeneSpring
software (Agilent Technologies). After selection, candidate genes

plasmids. U2OS cells were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid and an internal control vector, and after 5 hours, either miR-NC or miR-634 was additionally
transfected. After 36 hours, Fireﬂy and Renilla luciferase activity was measured. Seed sequences of miR-634 within the 30 -UTR of each gene and mutant
sequences are indicated (top panel in each column). The luciferase activity relative to that of the miR-NC-transfected cells is indicated on the vertical axis (bottom
panel in each column). The luciferase activity is weaker for vectors with the WT region than for the empty vector and is completely restored by inserting a
mutation within the seed sequence. Bar, SD.

Induction of Mitochondrial Apoptosis by miR-634

Fluor594 anti-mouse IgG antibody or Alexa Fluor488 anti-rabbit
IgG antibody (both 1/2,000 dilution; Life Technologies), and
coverslips were mounted in VECTASHILD containing DAPI (Vector). Images were obtained by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy
(Nikon).
Detection of mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular
ROS by FACS analysis
Mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ROS production were measured using the TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine,
ethyl ester) Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay Kit
(ab113852) and DCFDA Cellular ROS Detection Assay Kit
(ab113851), respectively (both from Abcam). For the TMRE
assay, cells were incubated with 200 nmol/L of TMRE for 30
minutes at 37 C with 5% CO2, and then suspended in PBS with
0.2% FBS. For the ROS detection assay, cells were harvested and
incubated with 20 mmol/L of DCFDA for 30 minutes at 37 C with
5% CO2. Fluorescence intensity in both procedures was measured
using an Accuri Flow Cytometer. Median ﬂuorescence intensity
was calculated using Flowjo software.
Generation of CDDP-resistant cells
Cisplatin-resistant cells from KYSE150, an ESCC cell line, were
generated by long-term cultivation in gradually increasing CDDP
concentrations. The cells were initially exposed to CDDP at a low
concentration (0.5 mmol/L) for 3 days, cultured in CDDP-free
medium to conﬂuence, and then exposed to CDDP at a higher
concentration; this cycle was repeated 5 times with gradually
increasing concentrations (0.5 mmol/L, 1 mmol/L, 2 mmol/L,
4 mmol/L, and 10 mmol/L of CDDP concentration). The cells that
could survive at 10 mmol/L of CDDP exposure were deﬁned as the
CDDP-resistant cells (KYSE150-R)
Quantitative RT-PCR
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed
using an ABI PRISM 7500 Fast Real time PCR System, Taqman
Universal PCR Master Mix, Taqman Reverse Transcription Kit, and
Taqman MicroRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems), according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression values are given as
ratios (differences between the Ct values) between miR-634 and
an internal reference, RNU6B.
In vivo tumor growth and administration of miRNAs
Five-week-old female BALB/c nude mice were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories, Japan. A total of 5.0  106 cells in 200
mL of PBS were subcutaneously injected into the ﬂanks of the mice.
After the tumor formation at day 7, the administration of miRNAs
and the treatment with CDDP were started. A mixture of 1 nmol
dsRNA and 200 mL AteloGene (KOKEN) was administered
around the tumor (miR-NC to the left ﬂank and miR-634 to the
right ﬂank of mice) at days 7, 9, 11, 14, and 16. Mice were also

intraperitoneally administered with PBS (PBS group; n ¼ 6) or
CDDP at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight (CDDP group; n ¼ 8) at
days 7 and 14. At 21 days after the injection of cells, mice were
sacriﬁced and tumors were enucleated. All experimental protocols
conducted on the mice were approved by the Tokyo Medical and
Dental University Animal Care and Use Committee.
Statistical analysis
Differences between subgroups were tested by the Student t test.
To compare Kaplan–Meier plots in two groups, two-sided logrank tests were used. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
Induction of apoptotic cell death by overexpression of miR-634
We have previously reported that four miRNAs, miR-507, miR634, miR-450a, and miR-129-5p, downregulate the expression of
NRF2 (NFE2L2; nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2), a transcription
factor involved in the ROS scavenging pathway, by directly
targeting its 30 -UTR (10). Interestingly, further examination
revealed that overexpression by transfection of 2 or 20 nmol/L
of miR-634, and not the other miRNAs, drastically induced cell
death in multiple human cancer cell lines, including HeLa (cervical cancer cell line), U2OS (osteosarcoma cell line), and
KYSE850 (esophageal cancer cell line; Fig. 1A and B). This miR634–induced cell death was not observed in normal cells, such as
ﬁbroblast and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL; Supplementary
Fig. S1). In Western blotting analysis, expression of the cleaved
form of caspase-3, caspase-9, and -PARP was markedly increased
in miR-634–expressing cells (Fig. 1C); furthermore, these
increased levels of cleaved-caspase-3 and -PARP were restored by
simultaneous treatment with z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1D). By FACS
analysis, the sub-G1 cell population, an indicator of apoptotic
nuclei, was markedly increased in miR-634–expressing cells compared with miR-NC–expressing cells, and these increases were
abrogated by simultaneous treatment with z-VAD-fmk (29.5% to
8.1% in HeLa cells, 27.2% to 4.3% in U2OS cells, and 21.6% to
4.7% in KYSE850 cells; Fig. 1E). These ﬁndings suggest that
overexpression of miR-634 may drastically induce apoptotic cell
death in a caspase-dependent manner in human cancer cells. On
the other hand, siRNA-mediated inhibition of NRF2, a known
miR-634–target gene, did not induce cell death, but slightly
inhibited cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that
concurrent downregulation of additional target genes may be
necessary for the induction of miR-634–induced apoptotic cell
death.
Identiﬁcation of miR-634–target genes
To identify genes that were downregulated by miR-634,
we performed expression array analysis on miR-NC– or miR634–transfected cells in three cell lines: HeLa, U2OS, and

(Continued.) D, cellular ROS detection assay. Cells were collected, incubated with 20 mmol/L of DCFDA for 30 minutes at 37 C, and ﬂuorescence intensity was
measured using ﬂow cytometry. The relative difference in median ﬂuorescence intensity against miR-NC- or negative control-siRNA (si-NC)–transfected
cells is shown in the graph (bottom panel). Bar, SD in triplicate experiments. E, Western blot analysis for cytochrome c released into the cytosol. Cytosolic or
mitochondrial fractions were isolated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoreacted with the indicated antibodies. F, Western blotting analysis for p62 and

marker. G, immunoﬂuorescence analysis of p62 and LC3B. U2OS cells were plated on coverslips and transfected with 20 nmol/L of miR-NC or miR-634. After
36 hours, the cells were ﬁxed, permeabilized, and immunoreacted with the indicated antibodies. LC3B or p62 antibodies were visualized using Alexa
Fluor488 anti-mouse IgG antibody (green) or Alexa Fluor594 anti-rabbit IgG antibody (red), respectively. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue).

Fujiwara et al.

KYSE850. As indicated in the Venn diagram in Fig. 2A, the
expression level of 1,835 genes was decreased by more than a
1.2-fold change in miR-634–expressing cells, compared with miRNC–expressing cells. By using the TargetScan program (http://
www.targetscan.org), among these genes, 626 were predicted to
be direct targets of miR-634, due to the presence of miR-634 seed
sequences in the 30 -UTRs (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Table S1).
Interestingly, in silico analysis using IPA (http://www.ingenuity.
com) and GO analysis revealed that several genes associated with
mitochondrial biogenesis and antiapoptosis were signiﬁcantly
enriched among the predicted target genes (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The expression level of two mitochondrial
genes, OPA1 (optic atrophy 1) and TFAM (transcription factor A,
mitochondrial), which are known to play a critical role in mitochondrial homeostasis through mitochondrial fusion and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (17, 18), and three antiapoptosis
genes, XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, E3 ubiquitin protein
ligase), BIRC5 (baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5), and APIP
(APAF1 interacting protein), which are known to inhibit
the caspase activation cascade (19–21), were markedly
decreased in miR-634–expressing cells compared with miRNC–expressing cells (Fig. 2D). In addition, ﬁve lysosome-associated genes (LAMP2; lysosomal-associated membrane protein
2, ATP6V1B2, ATP6V1F, ATP6V0B, and BLOC1S2) were included in the predicted target genes of miR-634, one of which,
LAMP2, showed decreased expression in miR-634–expressing
cells (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Thus, we
focused on 6 genes, XIAP, BIRC5, APIP, OPA1, TFAM, and
LAMP2, as likely miR-634–target gene candidates. The expression level of NRF2, a known target gene, was also conﬁrmed to
be decreased in miR-634–expressing cells as we previously
reported (Fig. 2D; ref. 10).
To examine whether miR-634 can directly bind to each 30 -UTR
of these genes, luciferase assays using reporter plasmid vectors
having wild-type (WT) or mutant (Mut.) seed sequences within
the fragments of each 30 -UTR (Fig. 2E) were performed in U2OS
cells. The luciferase activity of the WT vectors, except for one of the
two seed sequences within the 30 -UTR of XIAP (Region-2), was
signiﬁcantly reduced compared with the empty vector in miR634–expressing cells, and completely restored with Mut. vector,
which had mutations within the seed sequences (Fig. 2E). These
results suggest that miR-634 can directly downregulate expression
of these 6 novel target genes, in addition to NRF2, by binding
to the 30 -UTRs. Moreover, we showed that transfection with a
mixture of siRNAs for 7 target genes resulted in remarkable
growth inhibition and increase of cleaved PARP level (Supplementary Fig. S3), strongly suggesting that concurrent downregulation of these target genes may be critical for the induction of
miR-634–mediated apoptotic cell death.
Furthermore, nevertheless there was no signiﬁcant difference
for endogenous expression level of miR-634 between cancer cells
(Hela, U2OS, and KYSE850) and normal cells (WI-38 and three
LCLs), miR-634–target proteins, especially BIRC5 and NRF2, were
highly expressed in cancer cell lines compared with normal cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4). This may be possible explanation for
mechanism that the expression of miR-634 was more effective in
cancer cells than in normal cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Induction of mitochondrial injury by miR-634
To further evaluate the biologic features of miR-634–mediated
apoptotic cell death, change in mitochondrial status was ﬁrst

3896 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

evaluated due to multiple miR-634–target genes' involvement in
mitochondrial functions (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 2).
When miR-634 was expressed in U2OS cells, mitochondrial injury
was increased in miR-634–expressing cells, indicated by fragmented morphology, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential,
increase in ROS production, and release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria to the cytosol (Fig. 3). These results suggest that
overexpression of miR-634 triggers the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, to estimate the contribution of the downregulation of miR-634–target genes on
mitochondrial injury, we examined mitochondrial status in
siRNA-mediated knockdown cells for each gene. Effective knockdown of each gene was conﬁrmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3A).
Fragmented mitochondria were observed in OPA1-knockdown
cells as previously reported (17), but not in knockdown cells of
other genes (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Furthermore, we found
that mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased in TFAMand LAMP2-knockdown cells, and ROS production was increased
in TFAM-, LAMP2-, and NRF2-knockdown cells (Fig. 3C and D).
These ﬁndings suggest that concurrent downregulation of multiple miR-634–target genes triggers mitochondrial injury in miR634–mediated apoptotic cell death. On the other hand, it is
known that autophagy partakes in the removal of damaged
mitochondria via lysosomal degradation, called mitophagy, contributing to mitochondrial quality control (22). Levels of form-II
LC3B, an indicator of autophagosomes, and p62 protein, a
substrate of autophagic degradation, were increased in miR634–expressing cells (Fig. 3F; refs. 23, 24). Furthermore, these
proteins were observed to be frequently colocalized at the
same punctate structures in miR-634–expressing cells by immunoﬂuorescence analysis (Fig. 3G). These ﬁndings suggest that
miR-634 impairs autophagic degradation, possibly due to
lysosomal dysfunction via concurrent downregulation of lysosome-related genes, including LAMP2, resulting in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. Taken together, these
ﬁndings imply miR-634 triggers the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by targeting genes involved in
mitochondrial homeostasis.
Augmentation of chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity by
miR-634
Because the cytotoxicity of cancer drugs such as cisplatin
(CDDP) and 5-FU is closely associated with the mitochondrial
apoptosis pathway (11, 25, 26), we speculated that combined
treatment with enforced expression of miR-634 may be able to
effectively enhance chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. To validate this idea, we used KYSE170 cells, an ESCC cell line, because
CDDP and 5-FU are the most utilized drugs for chemotherapy of
this type of tumor (27). KYSE170 cells transfected with a high
concentration (20 nmol/L) of miR-634 and simultaneously treated with CDDP or 5-FU showed drastically decreased cell viability
(Fig. 4A). Furthermore, neither transfection with a low concentration (0.2 nmol/L) of miR-634 nor treatment with 2.5 mmol/L of
CDDP alone was able to induce cell death, demonstrating combined treatment was necessary for markedly increased cell death
(Fig. 4B). This combined effect of both miR-634 and CDDP was
also observed in other ESCC cell lines (data not shown). In
Western blotting, levels of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP were
increased in cells with combined treatment, compared with
transfection of miR-634 or treatment by CDDP alone, and the
expression levels of miR-634–target genes were decreased in miR-

enforced expression of miR-634 may effectively enhance chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in ESCC cells, even with a low
concentration of miR-634. Next, to examine whether the enforced
expression of miR-634 can intervene in ESCC resistance to CDDP,

viability assay showed that enforced expression of miR-634 at a
low concentration (0.2 nmol/L) attenuated resistance to CDDP
(IC50, 11.31 mmol/L in miR-NC-expressing cells, 2.45 mmol/L in
miR-634–expressing cells; Fig. 4D and E). These results suggest
that enforced expression of miR-634 can lessen ESCC-acquired
resistance to CDDP.

treatment with PBS or CDDP twice administered intraperitoneally (7 and 14 days after the injection of cells; Fig. 5A). There
were no observations for any adverse events, such as body
weight loss (Supplementary Fig. S6) or local damage around skin
area in which miRNAs were administrated. As a result, tumor
weights at 21 days after injection of cells were signiﬁcantly reduced
in mice receiving combined treatment of CDDP and miR-634,
compared with mice receiving combined treatment of CDDP and
miR-NC (P ¼ 0.0081; Fig. 5B–D). In addition, the enforced
expression of miR-634 together with the downregulated expression of OPA1, BIRC5, and NRF2 proteins was conﬁrmed in miR634–treated tumors (Fig. 5E and F). Finally, expression analysis of
miR-634 by qRT-PCR was performed with 40 paired samples from
patients with ESCC. MiR-634 expression reduction of more than
50% in primary tumor tissue compared with corresponding
noncancerous tissue was observed in 25 cases (62.5%; Supplementary Fig. S7); this frequency conﬁrms results from our previous report (10). However, there was no statistical signiﬁcance in
overall survival rate or recurrence-free survival rate between the
patients with high or low expression of miR-634 (Supplementary
Fig. S7). Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that concurrent
modulation of miR-634–target genes may be a therapeutically
effective adjunctive treatment with chemotherapy for ESCC
tumors, and may beneﬁt patients with miR-634–downregulated
ESCC tumors.

identiﬁed as direct targets of miR-634. Notably, OPA1 and TFAM
are known to play a critical role in mitochondrial homeostasis via
mitochondrial fusion and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA,
respectively. Inhibition of these genes has been suggested to be
associated with induction of apoptosis and enhancement of druginduced cytotoxicity (17, 18, 29–32). Hence, concurrent downregulation of these mitochondria-associated genes by miR-634
may induce mitochondrial injury or initiate mitochondrial
apoptosis. On the other hand, it is known that damaged mitochondria are immediately removed via an autophagy-mediated
degradation system in lysosomes (22). In the present study, we
observed that overexpression of miR-634 impaired autophagic
degradation possibly due to lysosomal dysfunction via downregulation of lysosome-associated genes, including LAMP2, a
well-known lysosomal membrane protein (33), suggesting that
accumulation of damaged mitochondria may contribute to the
initiation of mitochondrial apoptosis. In addition, concurrent
downregulation of apoptosis inhibitors, including APIP, XIAP,
and BIRC5, together with the ROS scavenger NRF2, may coordinately promote the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In previous studies, it has been suggested that miR-634 strongly inhibits
cell growth in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and prostate cancer
cells; however, direct target genes contributing to this growth
inhibition had not been identiﬁed (34, 35). As summarized in Fig.
6A, our ﬁndings in this study suggest that overexpression of miR634 may trigger the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway by directly and concurrently targeting multiple genes
associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and the cytoprotective
processes against apoptosis in human cancer cells. However, the
physiologic function of miR-634 in environments that induce
apoptosis in humans remains unknown, requiring further
investigation.

contribution of the enforced expression of miR-634 on the reduction of
chemoresistance.

Chemotherapy is one of the standard methods of treatment for
many cancers and is often capable of inducing apoptosis in
tumors, resulting in a reduction of the tumor bulk; however,
many cancer patients experience recurrence and ultimately death
due to the acquisition of chemoresistance by tumor cells (11, 36).
The ability of tumor cells to acquire chemoresistance is known to
be via activation of cytoprotective processes against apoptosis,
and therapeutically targeting these processes may be effective in
overcoming chemoresistance (11–13). Our group as well as
others has identiﬁed several miRNAs that can directly target
cytoprotective processes, including the antiapoptosis pathway
(XIAP, BIRC5), antioxidant activity (NRF2), and autophagy
(ATG4, ATG7), and demonstrated that enforced expression of
these miRNAs promotes drug-induced apoptosis in several
human cancers (10, 37–43). On the other hand, clinical trials
for miRNA therapy of liver and malignant hematopoietic cancers
using a synthetic miR-34a mimic are currently ongoing (44, 45).
Compared with other strategies, such as siRNA-based therapies,
one advantage of miRNA therapy may be its ability to concurrently target multiple genes that are associated within the
same network (44, 45). An introduction of miR-634 at high

concentration of 20 nmol/L is not physiologic levels and may
induce some off-target effects. However, in the present study,
we indeed showed that the effect of miR-634 at high concentration was slight in normal cells, and importantly the introduction with low concentration (0.2 nmol/L) or the in vivo
administration of miR-634 could enhance drug-induced cytotoxicity by concurrently targeting multiple genes associated
with the cytoprotective processes, which result in chemoresistance. Since it has been known that some miR-634–target
genes were overexpressed in several types of tumor including
ESCC tumors and its upregulation contribute to chemoresistance, introduction of miR-634 even at low dose may be
therapeutically valuable in cancer cells highly expressing its
target genes, although the development of effective delivery
system is required for its clinical usage. Thus, miR-634 may be
one potential agent in miRNA-based cancer therapy and a
modulator of conventional chemotherapy with small adverse
events.
It has been reported that miR-634–target genes that we identiﬁed were highly expressed in several tumor cells compared with
noncancerous tissues. In addition, our analysis revealed that the
effect of miR-634 was speciﬁc in cancer cells, not in normal cells.
ESCC is a cancer with worse prognosis than other cancers, and
chemotherapy with or without radiation is used for patients with
either unresectable tumors, or with recurrence after radical surgery
(46). Despite recent advances in genomic sequencing, effective
molecular targeting drugs for ESCC have not yet been established,
unlike other types of cancers; therefore, conventional chemotherapy, including drugs such as CDDP or 5-FU, remains important
for the treatment of ESCC. Development of chemoresistance is a
persistent problem in ESCC patients, and establishing a novel
strategy to overcome this is needed. Although further studies on
delivery, potential off-target effects, and safety are required, our
ﬁndings suggest that miR-634–mediated modulation of mechanisms involved in chemoresistance may be a reasonable strategy to
maximize the outcome of conventional chemotherapy in ESCC.
