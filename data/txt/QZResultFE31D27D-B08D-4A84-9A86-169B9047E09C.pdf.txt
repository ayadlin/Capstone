ABSTRACT
Targeted therapies within the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling axis become
increasingly popular, yet cross-talk and feedbacks in the signalling network lead to
unexpected effects. Here we look systematically into how inhibiting RAF and MEK with
clinically relevant inhibitors result in changes in PI3K/AKT activation. We measure
the signalling response using a bead-based ELISA, and use a panel of three cell lines,
and isogenic cell lines that express mutant forms of the oncogenes KRAS and BRAF
to interrogate the effects of the MEK and RAF inhibitors on signalling. We find that
treatment with the RAF inhibitors have opposing effects on AKT phosphorylation
depending on the mutational status of two important oncogenes, KRAS and BRAF.
If these two genes are in wildtype configuration, RAF inhibitors reduce AKT
phosphorylation. In contrast, if BRAF or KRAS are mutant, RAF inhibitors will leave
AKT phosphorylation unaffected or lead to an increase of AKT phosphorylation. Downregulation of phospho-AKT by RAF inhibitors also extends to downstream transcription
factors, and correlates with apoptosis induction. Our results show that oncogenes
rewire signalling such that targeted therapies can have opposing effects on parallel
pathways, which depend on the mutational status of the cell.

INTRODUCTION

cascades rarely act as independent parallel pathways.
Rather, they influence each other at different points and
phases of signal transduction in positive and negative
direction, resulting in a dynamic and complex crosstalk. For example, perturbation of MEK increases
EGFR induced AKT activation [5–7]. Similarly, strong
IGF stimulation results in an activation of AKT which
in turn cross-inhibits ERK signalling. Mechanistically,
this is thought to be mediated by phosphorylating RAF
at inhibitory sites by AKT [8–12]. These cross-talk
mechanisms prevent ERK-dependent growth arrest and
promote proliferation [9].
The significant advances in elucidating these
pathways have resulted in a better understanding of tumors
that are driven by these pathways, and an improved survival.
One example is colorectal cancer, where 50% of patients

During the past decade, AKT has emerged as a
central player in signal transduction pathways activated
in response to insuline or growth factors. The activated
kinase AKT regulates a number of targets, with more than
100 AKT substrates known today [1–3]. The majority of
the substrates is involved in essential biological functions
such as proliferation, survival and apoptosis, and AKT
has also been implicated in epithelial to mesenchymal
transition [4, 2, 3]. The signalling pathway involving the
activation of PI3K that leads to AKT activation is well
studied, and many growth factors trigger this pathway.
In addition to the PI3K/AKT pathway, growth factors
also activate the mitogenic RAS/ERK cascade. Thus,

and KRAS), HCT116 (KRASG13D), and HT29 (BRAFV600E)
colon carcinoma cells with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244
or with the RAF inhibitor Sorafenib for various periods
of time. We then assayed pathway activity by measuring
phospho-AKT, phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK using
bead-based ELISAs (Luminex). As shown in Figure 1A
(left panel) we found that MEK phosphorylation was
increased upon treatment with MEK inhibitors in CaCO2
and HCT116, and was unchanged in HT29 cells. This
finding is in line with previous reports that attribute
this effect to a feedback loop from ERK to RAF, which
induces RAF activity and MEK phosphorylation when
cells are treated with a MEK inhibitor [26, 28]. When
cells depend on a BRAFV600E mutation like HT29 cells,
this feedback is disrupted and thus MEK phosphorylation
is not increased [26, 27]. When we treated the cells with
the RAF inhibitor Sorafenib, we observed no increase in
MEK phosporylation, but a decrease in most cell lines
(Figure  1B, left panel), confirming that Sorafenib does
block RAF activity. When we monitored AKT activity,
we saw a modest increase of phospho-AKT both after
treatment with MEK inhibitor and Sorafenib in HCT116
and HT29 (Figure 1A and 1B, right panel). Also this
increase confirms previous reports that inhibition of
MAPK signalling sensitises the EGF receptor and thereby
induces AKT [6]. Unexpectedly, however, we found a
decrease in AKT activation in CaCO2 cells, when they
were treated with Sorafenib (Figure 1B, right panel).
To investigate whether these rather surprising
effects of Sorafenib on AKT signalling in CaCO2 cells
manifests itself also on downstream processes, we
performed reporter assays for two transcription factors,
ELK1 and FOXO3a, which are downstream of ERK
and AKT, respectively. In agreement with the signalling
data, ELK1 activity was down-regulated both by the RAF
inhibitor Sorafenib and the MEK inhibitor treatment,
albeit MEK inhibition resulted in more pronounced
reduction of ELK activity (Figure 1C). The FOXO3a
reporter showed reduced activity post Sorafenib treatment,
and a mild up-regulation after treatment with the MEK
inhibitor (Figure  1C). Thus, these experiments confirm
that the effects of Sorafenib on signalling also extend to
transcription factors downstream of ERK and AKT.
We observed that Sorafenib inhibited AKT activity
only in CaCO2 colon carcinoma cells that are BRAF and
KRAS wildtype, and led to an increase in AKT activity in
the other cell lines, which had mutations in either KRAS
or BRAF. We therefore hypothesised that Sorafenib
mediated inhibition of AKT signalling only occurs if the
RAS/RAF signalling axis is wildtype. To test this, we used
CaCO2 cells, which were stably transfected with inducible
BRAFWT, mutant BRAFV600E or KRASG12V, and an empty
expression vector as control. Figure 2A shows that indeed
Sorafenib treatment resulted in the down-regulation of
activated AKT in control cells and cells over-expressing
wildtype BRAF. In contrast, those cells over-expressing

carry a mutant KRAS in their tumors indicating that the
other half of patients could respond to anti EGFR therapy
[13]. Nevertheless, 40% of patients with wildtype KRAS do
not respond. In these patients mutant BRAF, which is present
in 5–10% of the tumors, may affect response outcome
[13, 14]. Beside KRAS and BRAF mutations, about 40%
of malignant tumors carry known activating PI3K/AKT
alterations [15], emphasising the importance to understand
the signalling between the two pathways. Information about
the tumor genotype, and in particular about mutations in
PI3K/AKT, KRAS and BRAF are currently used to predict
the success of systemic chemotherapy of different types of
tumors and are used to stratify patients for treatment options
for example in colon cancer [16].
The multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib was initially
designed as a CRAF inhibitor, but is also a potent
inhibitor of BRAF. The inhibitor has been shown to induce
apoptosis and necrosis in various types of tumors cells, e.g.
in acute myeloid leukaemia, renal cell and hepatocellular
carcinoma [17–21]. Sorafenib has been shown to modulate
AKT activity. In hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC),
Sorafenib treatment leads to activation of AKT and
up-regulation of its downstream factors [22, 23]. The
increase in phosphorylated AKT and the existing crosstalk between the PI3K/AKT and RAS/ERK axis indicate
a compensatory mechanisms of the PI3K/AKT pathway
which may contribute to Sorafenib resistance [24, 25].
However, the mechanisms behind this cross-talk remain
unclear.
In this study we have identified an interaction
between RAF and AKT pathways, in which inhibition of
RAF with Sorafenib and other RAF inibitors negatively
regulates AKT activity resulting in increased apoptosis
and reduction of proliferation. Interestingly, this effect
is only apparent in cells harbouring no mutations in
either KRAS or BRAF. While the mechanism behind
this cross- talk remains unclear, the response of AKT to
Sorafenib is predicted to be a good marker for therapeutic
efficiency of Sorafenib, as it correlates both with genotype
and phenotype after treatment.

RESULTS
Decreased AKT phosphorylation in RAS/ RAF
wildtype colon carcinoma cells after RAF
inhibition
The network of RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT signalling
pathway is a complex regulatory circuit, which includes
feedback loops and cross-talk between the two pathways.
Importantly, these feedbacks and cross-talk can shape
the response of tumor cells to targeted therapies, which
may be different depending on mutations in the pathway,
such as in KRAS or BRAF genes [26, 6, 27]. To explore
how different mutations change the response of tumor
cells to drugs we treated CaCO2 (wildtype for BRAF

in CaCO2 cells at early time points (10– 15 min), which
indicates that the effect is not mediated by secondary
responses such as transcriptional alterations.
Next, we wanted to investigate how RAF inhibition
modulates the response of AKT to external stimuli. We
decided to use two growth factors, FGF2 and IGF1, that
are known to activate preferentially the RAF/MEK/
ERK and PI3K/AKT signalling axes, respectively. We
stimulated CaCO2 cells harbouring the empty vector
control, or overexpressing wildtype BRAF, BRAFV600E and
KRASG12V. We observed that FGF2 primarily stimulated
ERK phosphorylation, and triggers a mild increase in AKT
phosphorylation (Figure 2C, 2D) in all four cell lines. In
contrast, IGF1 treatment alone had little effects on ERK and
led to activation of AKT in these cell lines (Figure 2C, 2E).

KRASG12V or BRAFV600E showed unchanged AKT
phosphorylation. One could hypothesise that the effect of
Sorafenib is mediated by MAPK signalling, however, the
experiments with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 showed
that MEK inhibition does not change AKT phosphorylation
in KRAS/BRAF wildtype cells.
To get further insights if Sorafenib treatment affects
AKT phosphorylation only as a secondary adaptive
response of the cells, i.e. that the cells are in a different
state and express many other genes, or that the cells have a
different cell-cycle distribution, we analysed the kinetics by
which Sorafenib reduces AKT activity. CaCO2 and CaCO2
cells expressing BRAFV600E were treated with Sorafenib
for various time points between 10 min and 30 min. As
shown in Figure 2B, phospho- AKT was down- regulated

To study the effect of RAF and MAPK signalling
on AKT, we then pre-incubated the cells for 2 h with RAF
or MEK inhibitors before we stimulated them. Again, we
found that Sorafenib led to a decrease of AKT signalling
in BRAF/KRAS wildtype cells, even when cells were
stimulated with FGF2 (Figure 2D), and Sorafenib had
no effect on AKT in cells expressing mutant BRAF or
KRAS. Pre-incubation with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244
led to an increase of AKT phosphorylation in most cell
lines when compared to treatment with FGF2 alone. This
is in line with previous results that show sensitisation of
receptors due to negative feedback, albeit sensitisation
was most pronounced for the EGFR [6]. Interestingly, we
observed that Sorafenib and AZD6244 had no effect on
AKT signalling triggered by IGF1 (Figure 2E), suggesting
that Sorafenib does not affect the IGF/PI3K/AKT core
signalling module.
Sorafenib is known to have a wide range of targets
apart from RAF [21], and therefore the observed effects
on AKT may be due to other targets apart from RAF. We
therefore tested whether other RAF inhibitors have similar
effects on RAF. We treated our panel of CaCO2 control
cells, and CaCO2 cells expressing wildtype BRAF, and

mutant BRAF and KRAS with two additional inhibitors
of RAF (AZ628, L779450) and measured the response
of AKT, ERK and MEK phosphorylation (Figure 2F,
Supplementary Figure 1). We find that both inhibitors
elicit a similar response to Sorafenib, as they block MEK/
ERK signalling irrespective of the mutation, but only lead
to a down-regulation of phospho-AKT signalling, when
BRAF and KRAS are wildtype.
Taken together, the results so far indicate that RAF
inhibitors modulate AKT signalling response to external
cues that also trigger MAPK signalling. It has opposite
effects on AKT in KRAS/BRAF wildtype versus mutated
cells, it affects response to external stimuli, but it does not
modulate the core PI3K/AKT module.

RAF-inhibitor-induced AKT inhibition extends
to other cell types and leads to an inhibition of
proliferation and induced apoptosis
Based on the observation that RAF inhibition
down-regulates AKT activity we were keen to understand
whether the reduction of AKT affects proliferation
or apoptosis. We measured CaCO2 cell growth using

Figure 2: Downregulation of AKT activity by Sorafenib is restricted to BRAF/KRAS wildtype cells. (A) CaCO2 control

cells and CaCO2 cells expressing wildtype, V600E mutated BRAF or G12V mutated KRAS were treated with 10 μM Sorafenib, 1 μM
AZD6244 or PBS for 4 h. Signalling was measured using multiplex assays (Luminex platform). After Sorafenib treatment, phospho-AKT
is lower compared to PBS in CaCO2 cells expressing the control vector or wildtype BRAF, but remains unchanged in cells expressing
BRAFV600E or KRASG12V. AKT-phosphorylation is either not affected or increased in all cell lines when treated with AZD6244. (B) CaCO2
control and cells expressing V600E mutated BRAF were treated with 10 μM of Sorafenib for times indicated. Phospho-AKT is downregulated in a time-dependent manner in control cells, but not in cells expressing BRAFV600E. (C) CaCO2 control cells and cells expressing
wildtype, V600E mutated BRAF or G12V mutated KRAS were stimulated with 0.005 μg/ml FGF2, 0.1 μg/ml IGF1 or PBS as a control
(D) CaCO2 control cells and cells expressing wildtype, V600E mutated BRAF or G12V mutated KRAS were treated with 10 μM Sorafenib,
1 μM AZD6244 or PBS for 2 h following stimulation with 0.005 μg/ml FGF2. AKT phosphorylation is lower compared to PBS in cells
expressing wildtype BRAF or control vector, but not in cells harboring a BRAFV600E or KRASG12V mutation. Phospho-AKT is increased in
all cells when treated with AZD6244. (E) CaCO2 control cells and cells expressing wildtype, V600E mutated BRAF or G12V mutated
KRAS were treated with 10 μM Sorafenib, 1 μM AZD6244 or PBS for 2 h following stimulation with 0.1 μg/ml IGF1. AKT phosphorylation
increases independently of MEK or RAF inhibition. (F) CaCO2 control cells and cells expressing wildtype, V600E mutated BRAF or G12V
mutated KRAS were treated with 200 nM AZ628 and 10 µM L779450. All data (n ≥ 3 replicates) were measured with Luminex technology
and shown as log2 fold change and standard deviation. Significant deviations are indicated with asterisk (p < 0.05).

real-time RTCA technology [29] (Figure 3A). We
observed decreased proliferation in CaCO2 cells after
24 h exposure with different concentrations of Sorafenib
(Figure 3A upper left panel). In contrast, following
treatment with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, proliferation
remained unaffected over time independent of inhibitor
concentration (Figure 3A upper right panel).
We were interested if reduced proliferation due to
Sorafenib treatment is restricted to colon cancer cell lines,
or whether it extends to other cell types. We therefore
measured proliferation in human embryonic kidney
(HEK) cells. We found that also this cell line showed
strong reduction in growth when treated with Sorafenib,
but no growth reduction when treated with the MEK
inhibitor (Figure 3A lower panel). This raised the question
whether the RAF-inhibitor-induced AKT inhibition is a
general mechanism that occurs when KRAS or BRAF are
wildtype. To investigate this, we also treated HEK cells
with RAF inhibitor Sorafenib and AZD6244 up to 4 h and
measured signalling. We observed a response similar to the
one in CaCO2 cells described above: AZD6244 treatment
resulted in unchanged AKT activity, decreased phosphoERK level and, possibly due to feedback regulation,

increased MEK phosphorylation (Figure 3B). Sorafenib
treatment again resulted in reduced AKT phosphorylation,
reduced MEK and ERK signalling. This shows that the
effect of Sorafenib on AKT is not limited to colon cancer
cell lines, but also extends to other cell types with wildtype
RAS/RAF-signalling axis such as HEK cells.
We then set out to investigate whether the effect of
Sorafenib on proliferation is dependent on a wildtype RAS/
RAF/ERK signalling axis, by using the isogenic CaCO2
cell lines that express inducible BRAFWT, BRAFV600E
or KRASG12V. We treated these cells with Sorafenib or
AZD6244 and measured proliferation using the metabolic
XTT assay. We observed that cell proliferation was
significantly decreased after Sorafenib treatment in CaCO2
cells that expressed BRAFWT, while it was unchanged
when mutant BRAF or KRAS were expressed (Figure 3C).
We then assessed whether apoptosis and necrosis
was induced by Sorafenib in these cells, by measuring
phycoerythrin (PE) labeled Annexin V and 7-Aminoactinomycin D staining (See Figure 4A). Sorafenib
treatment significantly induced apoptosis after 48 h in cells
expressing BRAFWT, but not in those expressing BRAFV600E
or KRASG12V (See Figure 4A, 4B). Interestingly, Sorafenib

cells. (A) Cell index of a real-time cell proliferation (XCelligence RTCA) of CaCO2 and HEK293 cells in response to concentrations

indicated of Sorafenib or AZD6244 compared to solvent control DMSO was measured up to 120 h. Proliferation was significantly reduced
at 5 μM to 50 μM Sorafenib, while proliferation was unaffected using MEK inhibitor. Mean value of cell index and spread of n = 3 replicates
were shown. (B) HEK cells were treated with 10 μM Sorafenib, 1 μM AZD6244 or DMSO for indicated times. Decreased AKT activity was

BRAF or G12V mutated KRAS were treated with 10 μM Sorafenib, 1 μM AZD6244 or DMSO for 24 h up to 96 h and analyzed with
XTT for proliferation activity. Proliferation decreased significantly in wildtype BRAF after Sorafenib treatment, but not in cells expressing
BRAFV600E or KRASG12V. Mean value and standard deviation of n = 3 replicates is shown.

treatment did not affect necrosis (Figure 4A, 4B). In line
with increased apoptosis, PUMA (BBC3), a member of the
BCL-2 family of pro-apoptotic proteins and direct target of
FOXO3a [30], is significantly up-regulated in CaCO2 cells
compared to BRAFV600E-expressing cells after Sorafenib
treatment for 48 h (Figure 4C).

In this study, we systematically interrogated
the effect of inhibiting MEK and RAF on both MAPK
signalling and AKT signalling in various colon cancer
cell lines with and without mutations in BRAF and KRAS.
We focussed our study on colorectal carcinoma cell lines,
because approximately 50% of colorectal tumors contain a
mutated KRAS gene [15], and further 10% harbor mutated
BRAF [15, 34].
Many effects of the inhibitors on upstream signalling
and AKT signalling that we observed confirm previous
results and can be attributed to feedbacks. For example,
MEK inhibition leads to higher MEK phosphorylation
in BRAF wildtype cells, which can be attributed to a
feedback from ERK to RAF [26–28]. Another example
is the activation of AKT after MEK inhibition in BRAF/
KRAS mutant cell lines, which has been reported to be
mediated by a relieve of feedback inhibition of the EGF
receptor after drug treatment [33, 6, 5, 7, 35]. In contrast,
we found a rather surprising effect of Sorafenib (Nexavar)
on AKT signalling: In cells that have a wildtype KRAS/
RAF/MEK/ERK signalling axis, Sorafenib treatment
reduces AKT signalling, while in cells with mutant KRAS
or BRAF, AKT signalling tends to be up-regulated after
Sorafenib treatment. Using two additional structurally
unrelated RAF inhibitors we confirmed that the observed
effect is not specific to Sorafenib, but rather an effect of
blocking RAF. Reduced AKT signalling after Sorafenib

DISCUSSION
Mutations in the KRAS and BRAF genes are thought
to drive many tumors, and the signalling cascades and
downstream effectors with regard to those oncogenes
are considered as attractive pharmacological targets
[31]. Nevertheless, the effects of known and unknown
feedbacks and cross-talk are complicating the effort to
design effective compounds for patient specific therapy
[6, 27, 32, 33]. In this regard, cross-modulation of the
PI3K/AKT pathway, which controls processes like
cell survival and growth, has been implicated in drug
resistance [6, 33]. Reports about interaction between
RAF/MEK/ERK signalling and PI3K/AKT are manifold.
For instance, strong IGF stimulation results in a cross
inhibition of RAF by AKT. In that case, AKT negatively
regulates ERK activation by the phosphorylation of a
CRAF inhibitory site (Serine 259) [8–12]. Such crosstalk seem to depend on the type of ligand and the cellular
background or stage of differentiation [9].

Figure 4: RAF inhibitor induced AKT phosphorylation leads to induction of apoptosis in KRAS/BRAF wildtype cells.

treatment in KRAS/BRAF wildtype cells also extends to
downstream target levels, as shown with reduced FOXO3a
activity after Sorafenib treatment. We furthermore
show that the effects on AKT activity are indepenent of
MAPK signalling, as MEK inhibition does not result in
downregulation of AKT phosphorylation.
Very importantly and in line with the role of AKT
as a survival pathway, we find an induction of cell death
as evidenced by cleavage of caspase 3 and the nuclear
protein PARP. Induction of apoptosis after treatment with
Sorafenib was shown for several types of cancer [17, 36,
37, 18, 38], but the mechanism behind the induction of
apoptosis remain unclear, and has so far been attributed
to its effects on ERK signalling, and not been linked to
reduced AKT phosphorylation [39, 40, 20].
Several studies in leukaemia cell lines have shown
results which are in line with our study. For example,
induction of apoptosis and decrease of AKT activation
occurred in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells
after treatment with Sorafenib [41, 42]. Importantly, the
used ALL cell lines were wildtype for KRAS and BRAF
mutations. Other leukemic cell lines such as MV4–11,
KG1 or OCI/AML3, which are also wildtype for BRAF
or KRAS, showed an elevated apoptosis and decreased
proliferation after treatment with Sorafenib [17, 38].
A similar pattern was observed in the lymphoma cell
line SUD-DHL-4 V, which does not harbor mutations
in KRAS and BRAF. Contrary, RAS mutated Hodgkin,
pancreatic or hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines showed
increased P-AKT after perturbation with Sorafenib [43].
Taken together, these studies underline the consequence
of KRAS mutations on AKT activation after treatment
with Sorafenib. In pancreatic cells harboring a KRASG12V
mutation, no change in P-AKT occurs after inhibition
of RAF, with only a mild increase in apoptosis. Very
interestingly, in cells with a KRASQ61H mutation, a
decrease in P-AKT level and a high increase in apoptosis
were shown, which was comparable to wildtype cells
[44]. These observations suggest that that distinct KRAS
mutants differ in their spectrum of pathway crosstalk.
Taken together our results show strongly different,
even opposing response of AKT signalling in wildtype
compared to KRAS and BRAF mutated cells after RAF
inhibition.

Reagents
The following inhibitors were used in the various
assays: MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (1 μM unless otherwise
specified; Selleck Chemicals) and RAF inhibitor
Sorafenib (10 μM unless otherwise specified, LC
Laboratories), AZ628 (200 nM, Selleck Chemicals) and
L779450 (10 µM, Abcam). The solvent control was the
appropriate amount of DMSO. We used the following
ligands (all  Peprotech): IGF1 (0.1 μg/ml), and FGF2
(0.005  μg/ ml) solved in 0.01% BSA (bovine serum
albumin) in PBS (phosphate buffered saline).

Luciferase reporter gene assay
CaCO2 cells were co-transfected with luciferase
expression vector encoding FOXO3a (AddGene) or
ELK1 (kind gift of Markus Morkel, Charite) and Renilla
luciferase vector (internal control) using Lipofectamine
2000 (Life Technologies). After 4.5 h medium was
replaced and Sorafenib or AZD6244 was added for
4 h. Cells were harvested with passive cell lysis buffer
(Promega), and luciferase activity was measured using the
dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative activity
was normalised to the ratio of Firefly luciferase activity
to Renilla luciferase activity and calculated as the fold
difference from treatment to untreated control for each
expression vector.

Luminex bead-based technology
After treatment of cells lysates were collected and
the level of phospho-protein expression was analysed
with the Luminex system (BioRad, Hercules, CA)
using beads specific for phospho-MEK1 (S217/S221),
phospho-AKT (S473) and phospho-ERK2 (Thr185/
Tyr187) according to the manufacturer‘s instructions.
Briefly, samples were washed with PBS and lysed with
cell lysis buffer (BioRad). Lysate protein concentration
was determined with BCA (bicinchoninic acid) method
(Thermo Scientific). The beads and detection antibodies
were diluted 1:3. For acquiring data, the BioPlex Manager
software was used.

Metabolic activity was determined using the
tetrazolinum salt XTT (Roche) according to the
manufacturer‘s protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded in
96-well plates in triplicates and treated with Sorafenib,
AZD6244 or DMSO. After time indicated, cells were
incubated with XTT labeling mixture and measured using
an ELISA reader (Benchmark Plus BioRad) at 480 nm
with a reference wavelength at 680 nm. For proliferation
studies in real time, the XCelligence RTCA SP instrument
was used. CaCO2 and HEK cells were plated 24 h
before treatment with inhibitors or controls. Over time
of measurement, the system records the cell index (CI),
which reflects the cell attachment to the electrodes and is
proportional to the number of cells. Each treatment was
measured at least in triplicates. As the initial cell number is
variable and growth of the cell population is exponential,
averaging the growth curves is not reasonable. Instead,
we calculated the logarithmised and normalized cell
index log2(ci(t)/ci(t of inhibitor application)) and took the
average of these values [29].

Analysis of apoptosis and necrosis
Apoptosis and necrosis was determined using
Annexin V:PE and 7-AAD Apoptosis detection kit (BD
Pharmingen) and flow cytometry analyses. In brief, cells
were seeded and treated after 24 h with Sorafenib or
DMSO. Cells were incubated for 48 h and harvested. Each
cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer
and 5 μl of Annexin V:PE and 5 μl of 7-AAD were added.
After incubation time of 15 min at room temperature,
additional 100 μl of binding buffer were added. Flow
cytometry analyses were performed using BD Accuri C6
flow cytometer and data thus obtained were analysed with
FlowJo 10 software.
