Abstract
MPS1 kinase is a key regulator of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a mitotic mechanism specifically
required for proper chromosomal alignment and segregation. It has been found aberrantly overexpressed in a
wide range of human tumors and is necessary for tumoral cell proliferation. Here we report the identification
and characterization of NMS-P715, a selective and orally bioavailable MPS1 small-molecule inhibitor, which
selectively reduces cancer cell proliferation, leaving normal cells almost unaffected. NMS-P715 accelerates
mitosis and affects kinetochore components localization causing massive aneuploidy and cell death in a variety
of tumoral cell lines and inhibits tumor growth in preclinical cancer models. Inhibiting the SAC could represent a
promising new approach to selectively target cancer cells. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10255–64. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
In eukaryotic cells, the spindle assembly checkpoint
(SAC) is an evolutionarily conserved mitotic control
mechanism specifically required for proper chromosomal
segregation. The SAC ensures that cells do not divide until
all sister chromatids align at the metaphase plate and are
correctly captured by the mitotic spindle, resulting in
bipolar amphitelic attachment of chromosomes (1, 2).
Although not all the molecular aspects of this checkpoint
are understood, it ultimately produces a diffusible "wait
anaphase" signal that results in the suppression of the
ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of the anaphase promoting
complex/cyclosome (APC/C) by inhibiting its activator
cdc20 (3, 4). This results in a mitotic arrest by preventing
proteasome-mediated degradation of 2 key mitotic components: cyclin B1 and Securin (4).

Human monopolar spindle 1 (MPS1) kinase, also known
as TTK, is a dual serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical
role in SAC signaling by controlling chromosome alignment
and influencing the stability of the kinetochore–microtubule
interaction (5–7). MPS1 is a highly dynamic SAC member
expressed only in proliferating cells and is activated upon
phosphorylation during mitosis, where it is required for
proper kinetochore recruitment of essential SAC proteins
such as MAD1 and MAD2 (7–11).
The kinase activity of MPS1 is required to sustain SAC
functions in normal unperturbed mitosis and in response to
spindle-damaging agents (9, 12). In mammalian cells, MPS1
silencing causes inaccurate metaphase plate alignment of
chromosomes and accelerates mitosis, ultimately causing
massive aneuploidization not compatible with cellular survival (9, 12). Similarly, inhibition of MPS1 results in SAC override
in the presence of spindle poisons mainly in tumorigenic cell
lines (13) and causes premature mitotic exit and gross aneuploidy associated with cell death (14).
In zebrafish, MPS1 mutations are embryonic lethal, and
homozygous knockout mice as well as RNA interference (RNAi)
studies on other SAC components have revealed that a functional spindle checkpoint is essential for viability (2, 15–17).
Aneuploidy is a common feature of cancer cells seen in
70%–95% of human tumors, and over a century ago it was
hypothesized that this may be a possible cause of cancer (18,
19). Although SAC inhibition promotes aneuploidization,
genes encoding mitotic checkpoint components are rarely
mutated in tumors (20). Specifically, MPS1 has been found
upregulated in a number of tumors of different origins including bladder, anaplastic thyroid, breast, lung, esophagus, and
prostate (20–25). In addition, MPS1 has been identified in the
signature of the top 25 genes overexpressed in CIN and

aneuploid tumors (26). As the other SAC components have
also been found to be upregulated in different tumors, and
MAD2 overexpression was shown to promote tumorigenesis in
mice, it is probable that tumors become "addicted" to SAC
functions and the mitotic checkpoint could be required to
sustain their proliferation in the presence of aneuploidy (27–31).
Here we report the discovery of NMS-P715, the first orally
bioavailable, potent, and selective small-molecule inhibitor of
MPS1 kinase activity. The crystal structure of NMS-P715
bound to MPS1 indicates an ATP-competitive binding mode
and treatment of tumor cells with NMS-P715 promotes SAC
override, affects kinetochore component localization and
interactions, and causes massive aneuploidization leading
to cell death in a wide range of cancer cell types.
Proliferation data performed on a large panel of cellular
lines indicate selectivity toward tumoral cells, and oral administration of NMS-P715 to tumor-bearing mice resulted in
tumor growth inhibition at well-tolerated doses.
Our data provide, for the first time, compelling evidence
that selective inhibition of MPS1 kinase, SAC abrogation, and
consequent aneuploidy induction may represent a promising
new approach to cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments
HeLa cervical carcinoma cells (ECACC) were cultured in EMEM medium, U2OS osteosarcoma cells (American Type
Culture Collection) in DMEM, HCT116 colon carcinoma cells
(ATCC) in McCoy’s, and BJ Human normal fibroblasts (ATCC)
were cultured in DMEM/M199. All cell lines were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
and cells were cultured at 37 C in 5% CO2. Cells were authenticated by assessing short tandem repeats with AmpF/STR
identifiler (Applied Biosystems).
U2OS-YFP a-tubulin cells were transfected with an YFPa-tubulin overexpressing vector (Clontech) and selected in
G418 (400 mg/mL).
Nocodazole was used at 75 ng/mL and Taxol at 0.2 mmol/L
(Sigma). SP600125 and staurosporine were purchased from
Sigma and G€
o6976 from LC Laboratories, and NMS-P715 and
Danusertib (PHA-739358) were synthesized at Nerviano Medical Sciences and resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO;
Sigma). MG132 (Sigma) was utilized at 15 mmol/L and aphidicolin was added 12 hours before additional treatment at 0.5
mg/mL. DMSO was used as a negative control.
ArrayScan analysis
Mitotic checkpoint override was measured with an ArrayScan VTI system (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, U2OS cells (3,000/
well) were seeded in 96-wells plates. Twenty-four hours later,
cells were treated with nocodazole (75 ng/mL) and after 18
hours increasing concentrations of tested compounds (10
serial 1:3 dilutions from 10 mmol/L to 0.5 nmol/L) were added
for 2 hours. When tested, Taxol was used at 0.2 mmol/L and
MG132 was added together with inhibitors for 2 hours at 15
mmol/L. Fixed cells in 4% formaldehyde were then stained
with anti-phospho-histone H3 Ser10 (Cell Signaling) and DAPI

(1:500). ArrayScan software CitoNuc Trans (Thermo Scientific)
was used to calculate the percentage of phospho-histone H3–
positive cells.
Mitotic chromosome spread
After 24 hours of treatment with NMS-P715, HCT116 cells
were treatedfor 2 hours with nocodazole (75 ng/mL) and MG132
(15 mmol/L). Cells were then lysed in hypotonic solution (75
nmol/L KCl) for 20 minutes at 37 C and fixed in methanol/
glacial acetic acid (3:1) solution for 10 minutes at 4 C. Two or 3
drops of suspended cells were applied to glass slides and
chromosomes were stained with DAPI. Images were acquired
with an Axiovert 100 microscope (Zeiss) and chromosomes
were counted using Image pro-plus 5.0 (Media Cybernetics).
Time lapse
U2OS cells stably overexpressing YFP-a-tubulin were
seeded in 12-well plates. Images of cells were taken using a
time-lapse microscope (Cell Observer Zeiss) with a 32
objective equipped with a motorized stage (Zeiss). Images
were collected using the Axio Vision software (Zeiss).
Immunoblotting
For Western blot analysis, cell extracts were prepared in
SDS-Buffer (125 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS) and after
sonication and boiling, total extracts of the indicated samples
were loaded on SDS-PAGE precast gels (Invitrogen) or on 8%
acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels containing 12.5 mmol/L phos-tag
(32) and immunoblotted.
The following antibodies have been used: phospho-histone
H3 Ser10, phospho-H2AX Ser139 and MPS1 (Millipore), cyclin
B1, BUB3, MAD2, and BUBR1 (BD Biosciences), histone H3
and Securin (Abcam), ubiquitin (Invitrogen), Parp, anti-cdc20,
or cdc27 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive signals
were detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Pierce).
Coimmunoprecipitation
HeLa cells were lysed in E1A buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES,
pH 7.0, 250 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, and protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitations (IP) were done by incubating
2 mg of total extract with 2 mg of cdc20 (p55CDC—E7) or
cdc27 (C-20) specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a
negative control.
Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested, resuspended in cold phosphate buffer
saline (PBS), fixed with cold (20 C) 70% ethanol in PBS, and
stored at 4 C for at least 1 hour. Cells were then stained with
propidium iodide (25 mg/mL) in sodium citrate containing
0.001% nonidet and 25 mg/mL RNase A. The DNA content
was analyzed using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
Colony assay
BJ cells were plated in 12-well plates at 1,000 cells/well
and after 72 hours of treatment, cells were incubated in

Results
Discovery of NMS-P715 as a selective inhibitor of MPS1
kinase
NMS-P715 is a pyrazolo-quinazoline (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1), which was identified after a high-throughput

www.aacrjournals.org

library screening using a biochemical MPS1 kinase assay
followed by a medicinal chemistry expansion.
When evaluated against full-length MPS1 in a biochemical
assay, NMS-P715 was found to be a potent inhibitor with a
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 182
nmol/L in the presence of 8 mmol/L ATP, which is approximately twice its calculated Km value. Furthermore, inclusion of
a preincubation step significantly increased the compound
potency up to an IC50 of 8 nmol/L, suggesting a time-dependent mechanism of inhibition with a Ki of 0.99  0.16 nmol/L
(Supplementary Fig. S2A–F). Substrate and ATP titration
studies showed a pure ATP-competitive mechanism with a
reversible dissociation (Supplementary Fig. S2G and H).
To evaluate selectivity, NMS-P715 was profiled in vitro
against a panel of 60 kinases belonging to the different
branches of the human kinome (Supplementary Table S1).
NMS-P715 was found to be highly specific for MPS1, with no
other kinases inhibited below an IC50 value of 5 mmol/L and
with only 3 kinases inhibited below 10 mmol/L (CK2, MELK,

Colombo et al.

and NEK6), which were not significantly affected by compound preincubation (Fig. 1B). Importantly, no activity was
observed against other mitotic kinases including PLK1, CDK1,
Aurora A, Aurora B, or the SAC kinase BUB1 (Supplementary
Table S1). In comparison, in the same assay conditions, the
previously reported MPS1 inhibitor SP600125 (13) was 10-fold
less potent than NMS-P715 on MPS1 and, in addition, it was
highly unspecific, being more active on at least 12 kinases
including mitotic kinases with IC50 values well below 1 mmol/L
(Supplementary Table S1).
To better understand the source of affinity and selectivity
for MPS1, we solved the crystal structure of the MPS1

catalytic domain bound to NMS-P715. The 3.1 A structure
(PDB accession code 2X9E; Supplementary Table S2) reveals
that the compound binds in the ATP-pocket (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S3), where it makes a series of donor–
acceptor–donor hydrogen bonds with the MPS1 hinge residues (Glu603 and Gly605). The pyrazolo-quinazoline core of
NMS-P715 is sandwiched between Val539 and Leu654 and
the diethylphenyl moiety sits underneath the glycine-rich
loop where it packs against Ile663, Asp664, and the side
chain of Lys553. Presumably, the diethylphenyl moiety is
partially responsible for the compound high level of selectivity because the parent compound with the simple amide
is significantly less selective. This may be in part due to the
high level of shape complementarity between NMS-P715 and
Ile663, the residue immediately before the DFG motif that
makes extensive hydrophobic contacts with the inhibitor.
Isoleucine residues in this position are relatively rare so that
the majority of other kinases would not have the proper "fit"
for NMS-P715. Another factor contributing to the selectivity
is the presence of the trifluoromethoxy group on the phenyl
ring. In MPS1, this group binds in a pocket formed by Gln541
and the hinge segment Cys604-Gly605-Asn606. However, in
kinases with a residue bulkier than cysteine in the corresponding position, the size of the pocket would be significantly reduced, thus leading to a steric clash with the
trifluoromethoxy group.
Taken together, these data show that NMS-P715 is the most
potent and selective ATP-competitive MPS1 kinase inhibitor
described to date.
Cellular effects upon NMS-P715 treatment
MPS1 inhibition is expected to promote checkpoint override in the presence of spindle poisons and to increase the
velocity of the mitotic phase in unperturbed conditions (9, 12).
To verify the mechanism of action of NMS-P715, we treated
nocodazole-arrested U2OS cells at different compound concentrations and mitotic cells were then identified by following
histone H3 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Similarly to MPS1 silencing by RNAi (Supplementary Fig. S4B–D;
ref. 9), we confirmed that NMS-P715 promotes massive SAC
override with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of
65 nmol/L (Fig. 1D). In the same assay, NMS-P715 results were
far more potent than those for SP600125, the PKC inhibitor
G€
o6976, or the Aurora inhibitors MLN8054, ZM447439, and
Danusertib (PHA-739358), compounds previously described to
have the same effect (Supplementary Fig. S5A; refs. 13, 33, 34).

Moreover, NMS-P715 promoted mitotic bypass of both nocodazole or Taxol-arrested cells in an MG132-dependent manner, showing NMS-P715 independence on the type of
checkpoint triggering agent and confirming, as expected, that
proteasomal activity is required for the compound-mediated
mitotic exit (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
To analyze NMS-P715 activity in growing unperturbed
mitotic cells, we conducted time-lapse video microscopy
experiments in U2OS cells overexpressing YFP-a-tubulin. In
agreement with RNAi data (Supplementary Fig. S6; refs. 9, 12),
MPS1 inhibition by NMS-P715 leads to mitotic acceleration,
with anaphase starting before metaphase plate formation
(Fig. 2A). Mitotic-phase length was reduced by approximately
3 times (Fig. 2B) and, as a consequence, we observed a strong
reduction in mitotic cells (Fig. 2C). Notably, no defects were
detected in bipolar spindle formation or in cytokinesis
(Fig. 2A) and, differently from what has been reported in
budding yeast (35), centrosomal splitting was normal, thus
excluding a major role of the enzymatic activity of MPS1 in
centrosomal functions in human cells.
MPS1 was previously reported to be heavily phosphorylated during mitosis and a number of autophosphorylation
sites were identified (7, 11, 36). To determine a direct in vivo
regulation of MPS1 autophosphorylation by NMS-P715, cellular lysates of nocodazole-arrested HeLa cells were analyzed following treatment with the compound. NMS-P715
caused a specific shift in the migration of MPS1. This shift
was also observed in the presence of MG132, administered
to keep cells in mitosis and thus exclude the possibility
that this change was due to mitotic exit (Fig. 2D). Notably,
however, NMS-P715 did not cause a complete MPS1 dephosphorylation, which was achieved only in the absence of
MG132 upon mitotic exit, indicating that only a subset of
MPS1 phosphorylation sites are directly affected by compound treatment. In addition, Securin and cyclin B1 polyubiquitylation was induced, indicating an NMS-P715–
dependent activation of the APC/C ubiquitin E3 ligase
activity.
As MPS1 kinase has also been implicated in the recruitment of essential SAC components to the kinetochore (8, 9),
we investigated the kinetochore localization of different
mitotic checkpoint components upon NMS-P715 treatment
in the presence of MG132 in nocodazole-arrested HeLa cells.
NMS-P715 leads to an almost complete delocalization of
MAD1, MAD2, BUB1, and BUB3 (Fig. 2E; Supplementary
Fig. S7). Interestingly, MPS1 itself was also reduced, although
not to the same extent as the other SAC components. We
also observed a delocalization of Borealin, which was not
accompanied by a change in Aurora B localization. This
confirms a specific role for MPS1 on Borealin, which was
recently described as an MPS1 substrate (12). No modulation
was observed on CENPB, HEC1, and BUBR1. These data are
in full agreement with published data (Supplementary
Table S3), the only exception being the marked BUB1
reduction not previously reported. We can exclude the
activity of NMS-P715 on BUB1 kinase in vitro (Supplementary Table S1) and an explanation of this observation
might be that complete inhibition of MPS1, achieved only by

MPS1 inhibition leads to mitotic override affecting both of the
two putative SAC quality controls on cdc20: it affects MCC
integrity and stability and abrogates cdc20 ubiquitylation
allowing it to trigger APC/C activation (37).
In summary, the observed cellular effects indicate that
MPS1 is the main target of NMS-P715 in cells.
NMS-P715 inhibits tumoral cell proliferation
MPS1 depletion causes chromosomal segregation errors
and massive aneuploidy not compatible with cellular survival
(Supplementary Fig. S8; refs. 9, 12). Indeed, NMS-P715 treatment also causes SAC inhibition and mitotic acceleration,
which ultimately promotes chromosomal misalignment in
metaphase and anaphase (Supplementary Fig. S9A and B).
As a consequence, chromosome counts after mitotic spreads
revealed a dramatic increase in aneuploidy upon treatment
with NMS-P715 (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S9C).

at different doses for 2, 24, and 72 hours (Fig. 4B and C).
Already after 24 hours, NMS-P715 treatment caused a reduction in G1 phase and a flattening in G2/M phase of the cell cycle
as measured by flow cytometry. A similar profile was observed
upon MPS1 RNAi (Supplementary Fig. S8) and was also
confirmed in the colon-derived cell line HCT116 (Supplementary Fig. S10). Aneuploidization, together with the appearance
of a sub-G1 population, further increased at 72 hours (Fig. 4B).
This was accompanied by histone H3 dephosphorylation, Parp
cleavage, and histone H2AX phosphorylation, indicating mitotic exit and confirming subsequent induction of apoptosis
(Fig. 4C).
To follow the behavior of individual cells over a long period
of treatment, we analyzed U2OS cells upon NMS-P715 administration by time-lapse microscopy and established a fate
profile (Fig. 4D; ref. 38). After drug addition, we confirmed

NMS-P715 inhibits tumor xenograft growth
To evaluate the antitumor activity of NMS-P715 and to
examine the role of MPS1 kinase in tumor proliferation in vivo,
we administered the compound to nude mice bearing subcutaneous implanted human tumor cell xenografts and monitored tumor growth rate. At a dose of 10 mg/kg NMS-P715
showed an oral bioavailability of 37% and good pharmacokinetic properties, with an area under the concentration–time
curve (AUC) of 8 mmol/l*h. This was accompanied by low
clearance, long half-life, and good volume of distribution in
tissues (Supplementary Fig. S14).
NMS-P715 was administered by oral route at 90 mg/kg
once a day for 7 consecutive days in an A2780 ovary carcinoma
xenograft model, resulting in 53% tumor growth inhibition at
the end of the treatment (Fig. 5A). At this dose, the compound
was well tolerated and there were no signs of body weight loss
or other overt toxicities. NMS-P715 antitumor activity was
also confirmed in the A375 melanoma xenograft model, with a
tumor growth inhibition of approximately 43% measured after
10 days of treatment at 100 mg/kg (Fig. 5B).
After administration of 100 mg/kg, pharmacokinetic parameters indicate a Cmax of 1.8 mmol/L that is reached 6 hours
after initiation of treatment, a prolonged half-life, and an AUC
of 50 mmol/l*h (Supplementary Fig. S14). At this dose NMSP715 leads to a reduction of histone H3 phosphorylation in
tumor samples (Fig. 5C), indicating that sufficient exposure
levels were reached to inhibit MPS1 kinase activity, causing
rapid mitotic exit.
Taken together, the in vivo data show the proof of concept
that MPS1 inhibitors reduce tumor growth in vivo and, for the
first time, propose a strong rationale for the development of
MPS1 or SAC inhibitors as a valid approach for cancer therapy.
In particular, we believe that slow-growing tumors that better

death. Importantly, colony assay experiments done in U2OS
cells treated with NMS-P715 for one entire cell cycle (22 hours)
followed by drug washout, revealed that one single aberrant
mitotic event is sufficient to commit cells to apoptosis (Fig. 4F;
Supplementary Fig S11B).
To evaluate NMS-P715 antiproliferation effects in a large
cell line panel, 127 cell lines were treated for 72 hours at
different compound concentrations. The IC50 for inhibition of
cell growth was determined for each cell line (Supplementary
Table S4), and the activity ratio was calculated (Supplementary Fig S12; ref. 39). Growth inhibition was observed in a wide
range of cell lines. Highest sensitivity was observed in colon,
breast, renal, and melanoma cell lines with IC50 values close to
1 mmol/L, whereas no correlation was observed between
antiproliferative effects and cellular doubling time or chromosomal number, which is known for the 52 cell lines
belonging to the NCI60 cell line panel (40). Notably, normal
cells were much less sensitive than tumoral cell lines to the
antiproliferative activity of NMS-P715 (Supplementary Fig
S12). To confirm this finding, normal human fibroblast BJ
cells were tested in colony-forming assay experiments and no
effect on colony growth was observed (Supplementary
Fig. S13). Thus, NMS-P715 has potent antiproliferative activity
and shows selectivity toward cancer cell lines.

Discussion
In the last decade, a number of mitotic kinases have been
identified as playing essential roles in the orchestration of the
cell cycle and some of these are the subject of targeted therapy
approaches in oncology (41).
Here we describe NMS-P715 as the first selective, ATPcompetitive, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of MPS1, a

MPS1 Kinase Inhibition as a Novel Anticancer Strategy

mitotic kinase expressed only in proliferating normal tissues
but aberrantly overexpressed in a wide range of human
tumors and required for proper SAC functions (1, 10). Similar
to MPS1 silencing experiments, NMS-P715 treatment promotes mitotic checkpoint override, reduces mitotic length,
and causes chromosomal misalignment, kinetochore and
MCC complex destabilization, and massive aneuploidization
leading to cell death in a wide range of cancer cell types.
Importantly, our studies show for the first time that selective inhibition of MPS1 and targeting of the SAC causes tumor
growth inhibition in xenograft models, and proliferation analysis done on a large panel of cell lines indicates higher activity
toward cancer cell proliferation while leaving normal cell
growth almost unaffected.
MPS1 inhibition and mitotic checkpoint abrogation introduce a completely new strategy to cancer therapy. Differently
from the classical antimitotic therapy, the objective is not to
arrest cell proliferation but to inactivate the SAC with the
consequence of an accelerated mitosis, which increases aneuploidy and results in cell death.
Whether aneuploidy is a cause or consequence of malignant
transformation is still under debate, with recent evidence
indicating that aneuploidy may not be a strong driver of
tumorigenesis (42). Complete inactivation of the mitotic
checkpoint is lethal in mice and in cancer cell lines, whereas
mice expressing reduced levels of mitotic checkpoint components, despite a high aneuploidy rate, rarely develop tumors
and in this case only after a long latency (16, 43). Finally, in
yeast cells and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts even the
addition of a single chromosome causes cellular stress and
fitness reduction and in mouse models of chemically or
genetically induced tumorigenesis, an increased rate of aneuploidy acts as a tumor suppressor (44, 45).
As most cancers are aneuploid, they must evolve a strategy to overcome this initial fitness reduction. Although some
cancer cell lines show a weakened mitotic checkpoint signaling, no clear correlation has been reported with chromosomal instability status and a number of reports indicate
that most aneuploid tumoral cell lines have an intact mitotic
checkpoint, often with high levels of checkpoint components
(20, 30, 42, 46, 47). Thus, MPS1 functions and checkpoint
activity could be selectively required to sustain and favor

aneuploid tumor proliferation and this could be the reason
why we observe higher activity of NMS-P715 against tumoral
cell lines. This view is supported by a recent report that
shows that MPS1 depletion is selectively toxic in tumor cell
lines if added in combination with Taxol (5). Current studies
are in progress to determine if different levels of checkpoint
components, or a specific genetic background, sensitizes
cancer cells to MPS1 inhibition. There is growing evidence
that the SAC function is particularly critical in the presence
of extra chromosomes in human cells or in a tetraploid
background in yeast (29, 48). In Drosophila cells, SAC functions have been shown to be specifically required to maintain proliferation of polycentrosomal cells (49), and in a
recent report a new MPS1 inhibitor (MPS1-IN-1) was
described to increase the frequency of multipolar mitosis
in a cell line containing extra centrosomes (14).
Our data provide strong evidence that inhibition of the SAC
by MPS1 inhibition may represent a novel approach to cancer
therapy with the potential to selectively block tumor cell
proliferation and makes NMS-P715 a suitable candidate for
further development toward clinical studies.
