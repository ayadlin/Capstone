The Insulin Receptor Negatively Regulates the Action of
Pseudomonas Toxin-Based Immunotoxins and Native
Pseudomonas Toxin
Xiu Fen Liu, David J. FitzGerald, and Ira Pastan

Abstract
SS1P is a recombinant immunotoxin composed of an antimesothelin Fv fragment fused to a truncated
portion of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. SS1P targets and kills mesothelin-expressing tumors, which include
mesothlioma as well as ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancers. SS1P is currently in clinical trials in
mesothelioma. Because insulin acting through the insulin receptor is a survival factor for many cancer cell
lines, we explored how lowering insulin receptor level would affect the cytotoxic action of SS1P. We show here
that siRNA knockdown of the insulin receptor enhanced the cytotoxic action of native Pseudomonas exotoxin
and enhanced SS1P toxicity on several human cell lines, but did not affect the response to other cytotoxic
agents such as TRAIL, etoposide, and cycloheximide. To determine how insulin receptor knockdown enhances
SS1P action, we analyzed various steps involved in cell killing. We found that insulin receptor knockdown
increases the cleavage of SS1P by furin, which allows more toxin to reach the cytosol and inactivate elongation factor 2. These ﬁndings indicate that the insulin receptor negatively regulates immunotoxin action.

Introduction
Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are now widely used to
treat cancer, but unfortunately many cancers are resistant
to antibody treatment. To take advantage of the selective
binding of antibodies to cancer cells, mAbs are now being
used to deliver different types of cytotoxic agents to these
cells (1). Immunotoxins are one such type of anticancer
agent in which protein toxins are attached to mAbs (2, 3).
We construct recombinant immunotoxins (RIT) by attaching a 38 kDa fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38) to
the Fv portion of a mAb chosen to react selectively with
cancer cells and not with essential normal tissues (3, 4). SS1P
(anti-mesothelin Fv-PE38) is a RIT that targets mesothelin,
a cell-surface protein that is highly expressed on mesothelioma cells, as well as pancreatic, ovarian, lung, and other
cancer cells (5, 6). After binding to mesothelin, SS1P enters
cells by endocytosis where the furin protease cleaves the Fv
from the toxin (7). The toxin then is transferred in a
retrograde fashion to the endoplasmic reticulum from which
it is translocated into the cytosol, there the toxin catalyzes

the ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of elongation factor
2, eventually leading to apoptosis (4, 7). Despite the effectiveness of SS1P and other immunotoxins in killing cancer
cells (8, 9), many of the mechanistic steps in immunotoxin
action have not been established. Understanding more
about these mechanisms could be useful in developing
strategies to make immunotoxins more effective in killing
cancer cells.
Insulin is an important ingredient in many types of tissue
culture media, because activating the insulin receptor promotes cell growth and protects against loss of viability and
apoptosis (10–12). Likewise, the presence of insulin-like
growth factor I (IGF-I), which also binds the insulin receptor,
can promote growth and survival. We hypothesized that
activities associated with the insulin receptor, including tyrosine kinase, could negatively regulate the ability of immunotoxins to kill target cells. Using siRNA technology to reduce
expression, we show here that knockdown of the insulin
receptor enhances the cytotoxic action of immunotoxin SS1P
on several human cancer cell lines. We provide evidence that
the insulin receptor acts as an early step in immunotoxin
action and regulates the cleavage of the immunotoxin by
furin, perhaps by regulating immunotoxin trafﬁcking. Of further interest, we report that other toxic agents, unrelated to
Pseudomonas exotoxin, were not enhanced by the silencing
of the insulin receptor.

matches were found.

hours before SS1P addition; however, the effects on inhibition
of SS1P activity were similar to the 1 hour inhibitor incubation
at 37 C in culture media. All experiments were done 3–4 times
with reproducible results.
Western blot analysis
Cells were washed in PBS and disrupted by the addition of
lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L
EDTA with 1% NP40, 5 mg/mL leupeptin, 5 mg/mL aprotinin,
10 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride) on ice for 30 minutes. After high-speed centrifugation, 20–40 mg supernatant
protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane and subjected to Western
blotting with detection by enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) or ECL plus (Amersham).
Internalization and FACS analysis
A431/H9 cells were transfected with siRNA for 48 hours in 6well plates, then 1 mg/mL of SS1P-Alex-647 was added and cells
were incubated at 37 C for the indicated times. After labeling,
the cells were washed with PBS and stripped with glycine buffer
containing 0.2 mol/L glycine (pH 2.5) and 1 mg/mL of bovine
serum albumin to remove surface bound SS1P. Cells were then
trypsinized, washed with ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) buffer (PBS with 5% FBS, plus 0.1% NaN3), and analyzed
by FACS Calibur.

Transfection and cytotoxicity assays
To knockdown the insulin receptor, 5,000 cells were transfected via the addition of 3 mL of 20 mmol/L siRNA, 3.5 mL of
DharmaFECT Transfection Reagent 3 (Dhmarcon) in 125 mL
ﬁnal volume per well for 96-well experiments. After 48 hours of
transfection, the cells were treated with SS1P or other toxic
agents at the indicated concentration for a further 72 hours.
Cell viability was then measured by the ATP levels using
CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). Viability is expressed as the percentage of luminance with SS1P
compared with control without SS1P treatment. All siRNA
experiments used an unrelated luciferase siRNA (GL2) as a
negative control.

SS1P cleavage
A431/H9 cells were transfected with siRNA for 48 hours in 6well plates, 1 mg/mL of SS1P was added to cells and incubated
on ice for 30 minutes to saturate SS1P binding. Cells were
changed to fresh media and incubated at 37 C for the indicated
time before making a total cell lysate.

Inhibitor study
Before experiments were initiated, 5,000 KB31 cells were
seeded overnight in 96-well plates. Inhibitors were added and
cells were incubated for 1 hour before the addition of SS1P.
After 72 hours of incubation, cell viability was measured by
ATP level. In some cases, inhibitors AGL2263 and rapamycin
were also added and cells were incubated for approximately 18

Insulin Receptor Regulates PE-Immunotoxin Sensitivity

Results

receptor speciﬁcally increases the ability of SS1P to kill a
mesothelin-expressing cell line.
To verify that the fall in ATP induced by SS1P in insulin
receptor knockdown cells was associated with an increase
in markers of apoptosis, we conducted Western blot analyses
on siIR-1-treated cells. Figure 1D shows that the level of
intact PARP was decreased and the levels of cleaved PARP
and cleaved caspase-3 were increased relative to cells treated
with SS1P alone (Fig. 1D). This result shows that apoptosis is
being simulated. In addition, we observed that SS1P treatment
of control cells decreased the insulin receptor level (Fig. 1D,
lane 1 vs. 3). We believe this occurs because SS1P inhibits
overall protein synthesis. In addition, we also found treatment
of cells with HB21-PE40 that targets the transferrin receptor
caused a fall of insulin receptor protein level (Supplementary
Fig. S2). When SS1P was combined with siIR-1, insulin receptor
protein was undetectable (Fig. 1D, lane 3 vs. 4).

Insulin receptor knockdown
Our strategy assumed that the insulin receptor would
be activated in cells growing in serum-containing media
because serum contains large amounts of IGF-I that, like
insulin, can activate this receptor. To investigate its role in
immunotoxin response, we used siRNA to knockdown the
mRNA encoding the insulin receptor and then determined
how effectively the immunotoxin SS1P killed various types of
mesothelin-expressing cells. To measure cell viability we
used the CellTiter-Glo assay, which measures cellular ATP
levels. In early experiments we used KB31 cells, which
express insulin receptor and are sensitive to killing by SS1P.
We evaluated 4 different siRNA oligos targeting the insulin
receptor: designated siIR-1, siIR-2, siIR-3, and siIR-4. As
shown in Fig. 1A, we found that 3 of these (siIR-1, -3, and
-4) increased the cytotoxic effect of SS1P (Fig. 1A) with
siRNA-1 being the most effective. We then measured the
levels of insulin receptor mRNA and protein after transfection with siIRs-1, -3, and -4 and found that siIR-1 caused the
greatest reduction in both mRNA and protein levels, which
also produced the greatest increase in SS1P cytotoxicity
(Fig. 1A–C). We have seen siIR-1 knockdown insulin receptor
protein level by 80% to 90% consistently and the IC50 value
decreased 3- to 5-fold in KB31 cells. Transfection with siIR-2,
which did not knockdown insulin receptor RNA or protein
levels, did not increase SS1P toxicity (Supplementary
Fig. S1). These results show that knockdown of the insulin

Insulin receptor knockdown on other cancer cell types
To determine if lowering insulin receptor affected SS1P
toxicity in other cancer cell types, we examined mesothelinexpressing cell lines: A431/H9 cells, which are an epidermoid
carcinoma cell line transfected with mesothelin, A1847
ovarian cancer cells and M30 mesothelioma cells. Figure 2
shows that knockdown of the insulin receptor increased the
cytotoxic effect of SS1P in all 3 cell lines as well as in KB31 cells
(Fig. 2A–D). Insulin receptor knockdown did not enhance the
killing by SS1P of cell lines, A431 and HAL-01, that do not

express mesothelin. This indicates that insulin receptor knockdown does not promote nonspeciﬁc killing by SS1P (Fig. 2E–F).
We also found that the growth rate of the cell lines was not
reduced by insulin receptor knockdown indicating the effect
on SS1P toxicity is independent of cell growth rate (data not
shown).
Immunotoxin speciﬁcity
To determine if the insulin receptor knockdown effect was
speciﬁc for an immunotoxin-targeting mesothelin, we examined the effects on a Pseudomonas exotoxin-containing immunotoxin (HB21-PE40) targeting the human transferrin receptor
and found that its cytotoxic activity was also greatly increased
(Fig. 3A). We also tested the effects of insulin receptor knockdown on immunotoxins that do not target receptors on KB31
cells and found that neither LMB9, which targets Lewis Y
antigen, or BL22, which targets CD22, had any toxic activity
(Fig. 3G and H), demonstrating that knockdown insulin receptor did not enhance nonspeciﬁc internalization.
Native Pseudomonas exotoxin receptor LRP1B is expressed
in KB cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). We also investigated if
insulin receptor knockdown affected the activity of native

2284

Cancer Res; 73(7) April 1, 2013

Pseudomonas exotoxin and found, as shown in Fig. 3B, that
Pseudomonas exotoxin toxicity was increased 5-fold. This
ﬁnding indicates that the effect of insulin receptor knockdown
is not restricted to an immunotoxin-targeting mesothelin.
We then tested other toxic agents such as diphtheria toxin
and cycloheximide, which inhibit protein synthesis, the extrinsic apoptosis inducer TRAIL, and etoposide, that acts through
an intrinsic pathway. Silencing the insulin receptor inhibited
cell killing by diphtheria toxin (Fig. 3C) and did not cause
signiﬁcant changes in the cell-killing activities of cycloheximide (Fig. 3D), TRAIL, or etoposide (Fig. 3E and F). These data
indicate that the insulin receptor plays a speciﬁc regulatory
role on immunotoxins containing Pseudomonas exotoxin or on
native Pseudomonas exotoxin.
Knockdown of insulin receptor affects SS1P processing
To investigate the mechanism by which the insulin receptor
controls SS1P toxicity, we measured the internalization of SS1P
by exposing cells to SS1P labeled with Alexa-647 for 5–120
minutes and using ﬂow cytometry to assess the amount of cellassociated SS1P in A431/H9 cells. Compared with the control,
there was no increase in the rate or amount of SS1P taken up by

siIR-treated cells (Fig. 4A). We also showed that SS1P internalization did not increase in KB31 cells after siIR-1 treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
After internalization, the next step in SS1P action is processing by furin. Cleavage by furin separates the Fv from the toxin
and generates a 35 kD toxin fragment. As shown in Fig. 4B, in
insulin receptor knockdown cells there was an increase in the
amount of the 35 kD fragment detected at 15, 60, and 150
minutes. By 150 minutes more than 90% of SS1P was degraded

same for either sample. This is consistent with interference of a
degradation step—that is PE35 is not degraded but is stabilized. However, at 150 minutes there is less full sized SS1P in
insulin receptor knockdown and more PE35 suggesting a
precursor product relationship presumably with furin). To
determine if an increase in furin levels was responsible for
the increase in SS1P cleavage, furin levels were measured using
Western blot analysis and were not found to increase after
knockdown of insulin receptor (Fig. 4B). Because furin is the

synthesis was affected we incubated cells for 20 hours with
SS1P after insulin receptor knockdown and measured 3H-Leu
incorporation into protein. Figure 4C shows that insulin
receptor knockdown greatly enhanced the ability of SS1P to
inhibit leucine incorporation.
Insulin receptor knockdown did not change
proapoptotic or antiapoptotic protein levels
Because the insulin receptor plays an important role in
cancer cell growth and apoptosis, we determined if knockdown of the insulin receptor would alter the levels of several
proapoptotic or antiapoptotic proteins. As shown in Fig. 5,
Mcl-1, which has been shown to play an important role in
immunotoxin killing (14), was not changed in knockdown
cells compared with control cells. Bax and xIAP (data not
shown) also did not change. We observed a small but not
signiﬁcant reduction in Bcl-xl and Bak, but this small change
would not explain the stimulation of SS1P-induced toxicity
and the reduction in diphtheria toxin-induced toxicity.
Together, these data indicate the effect of the insulin receptor is likely at the level of trafﬁcking and not on proteins
regulating apoptosis.

Insulin receptor level, but not IGF-IR, correlates with
SS1P toxicity
Insulin receptor and IGF-IR are very homologous and use
similar signaling pathways (12). Figure 6A shows that IGF-IR
knockdown slightly decreases SS1P toxicity, an effect totally
opposite to that of insulin receptor knockdown. However,
when the 2 siRNAs were combined, there was still stimulation
of SS1P activity although less than with insulin receptor
knockdown alone.
To examine this ﬁnding further, we conducted Western blot
analysis and found that treatment with siIGF-IR not only

only known cellular protease that cleaves Pseudomonas
exotoxin-related immunotoxins and because furin cleavage is
rate-limiting (see Discussion), these results indicate that lowering insulin receptor expression increases the processing of
SS1P by furin and generates an increased amount of the toxin
fragment. As a consequence there should be more free toxin
fragment available to move to the endoplasmic reticulum,
translocate to the cytosol, inactivate elongation factor 2, and

but also signiﬁcantly increased the insulin receptor level.
Furthermore, the insulin receptor level correlated with the
SS1P toxicity effect (compare Fig. 6A and B).

Discussion
We show here that lowering insulin receptor levels in various
cancer cell lines using siRNA knockdown increases the ability
of immunotoxins containing Pseudomonas exotoxin or of
native Pseudomonas exotoxin to kill target cells. This novel
function of the insulin receptor affects Pseudomonas exotoxinbased toxins whether they enter the cell bound to an antibody
to mesothelin or to an antibody to the transferrin receptor or
through the native receptor for Pseudomonas exotoxin. We
were surprised to ﬁnd that insulin receptor knockdown did not
enhance the cytoxicity of diphtheria toxin, which like Pseudomonas exotoxin inactivates elongation factor 2, but instead
protected cells from diphtheria toxin induced cell death. This is
probably because Pseudomonas exotoxin and diphtheria toxin
have different trafﬁcking pathways and reach the cytosol by
different mechanisms. Pseudomonas exotoxin must be cleaved
by furin and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum before
reaching the cytosol (15), whereas diphtheria toxin can be

www.aacrjournals.org

transferred directly to the cytosol from the endocytic compartment (7, 16). In addition, furin is the only cellular protease
known to cleave Pseudomonas exotoxin and Pseudomonas
exotoxin immunotoxins, suggesting insulin receptor knockdown is altering furin function but not other proteases.
It is known that one major action of insulin is the regulation
of the transport of GLUT4 containing vesicles causing them to
fuse with the plasma membrane and increase the amount of
GLUT4 on the cell surface. Under conditions of low insulin,
GLUT4 is sequestered in intracellular vesicles in muscle and
fat cells. Insulin induces insulin receptor activation and
through a complex cascade of signal transduction events
increases the uptake of glucose by inducing the translocation
of GLUT4 from these vesicles to the plasma membrane (17, 18).
It is possible that some of the same proteins that control
Pseudomonas exotoxin trafﬁcking also control the trafﬁcking of
the insulin receptor. This area is under investigation.
Several compounds have been found to inhibit the action of
insulin on target cells. We have investigated these agents to
determine if they regulate the increase in Pseudomonas exotoxin toxicity produced by insulin receptor knockdown. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary Table S1,
none of these agents enhanced SS1P cell killing and some of
them actually protected against cell killing when combined
with SS1P. The compounds investigated include the insulin
receptor/IGF-IR substrate inhibitor AGL2263, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, and a combination of both LY294002 and
PD98059 (Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, addition of
insulin to the cells did not protect cells from killing by SS1P
(Supplementary Fig. S1D). We have considered the possibility
that the insulin receptor works through another pathway to
regulate intracellular trafﬁcking. Boucher and colleagues have
presented evidence that the insulin receptor has a role in
apoptosis regulation that is independent of its kinase activity
(19). However, our ﬁndings here indicate the apoptotic protein
levels did not change before or after insulin knockdown (Fig. 5).
It is possible the insulin receptor function here also controls
membrane trafﬁcking. A kinase-independent mechanism of
insulin receptor action could include interaction with a scaffolding protein that controls trafﬁcking to lysosomes or retrograde trafﬁcking of proteins leading to the accumulation of
active PE35 in the cytosol.
Two splice variants of the insulin receptor exist in mammalian cells: insulin receptor-A, lacking exon 11, and full-length
insulin receptor-B. Insulin receptor-A predominates in fetal
tissues and is often upregulated in many cancer cells; insulin
receptor-B is present in adult muscle and fat cells and is
responsible for glucose regulation (20, 21). Our ﬁnding of an
insulin receptor function in cellular trafﬁcking may apply
to both isoforms, because the siRNAs used target both isoforms and enhance SS1P killing of KB31 cells, which express
both insulin receptor-A and insulin receptor-B, and of A1847
cells, which express predominantly insulin receptor-A (Supplementary Fig. S6). In addition, mouse brown adipocytes,
which predominantly express the insulin receptor-B isoform,
when insulin receptor gene is deleted are more sensitive to
Pseudomonas exotoxin than wild-type cells (data not shown).

Liu et al.

We conclude both isoforms are important for the immunotoxin or Pseudomonas exotoxin toxicity. The insulin receptor is
elevated and activated in several human maligancies including
breast, colon, and lung cancer (20, 22) and functionally
enhances tumor progression (23). Our ﬁnding of a novel insulin
receptor function that regulates membrane trafﬁcking may
contribute to the understanding of insulin action and the
insulin receptor in cancer and other human diseases.
