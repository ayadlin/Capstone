ABSTRACT
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is a new targeted treatment option for
refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. However, a limited
efficacy of bortezomib alone has been reported. A terminal pro-apoptotic endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR) is one of the several
mechanisms of bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Recently, it has been documented
that UPR disruption could be considered a selective anti-leukemia therapy. CX4945, a potent casein kinase (CK) 2 inhibitor, has been found to induce apoptotic
cell death in T-ALL preclinical models, via perturbation of ER/UPR pathway. In this
study, we analyzed in T- and B-ALL preclinical settings, the molecular mechanisms of
synergistic apoptotic effects observed after bortezomib/CX-4945 combined treatment.
We demonstrated that, adding CX-4945 after bortezomib treatment, prevented
leukemic cells from engaging a functional UPR in order to buffer the bortezomibmediated proteotoxic stress in ER lumen. We documented that the combined
treatment decreased pro-survival ER chaperon BIP/Grp78 expression, via reduction
of chaperoning activity of Hsp90. Bortezomib/CX-4945 treatment inhibited NF-κB
signaling in T-ALL cell lines and primary cells from T-ALL patients, but, intriguingly, in
B-ALL cells the drug combination activated NF-κB p65 pro-apoptotic functions. In fact
in B-cells, the combined treatment induced p65-HDAC1 association with consequent
repression of the anti-apoptotic target genes, Bcl-xL and XIAP. Exposure to NEMO
(IKKγ)-binding domain inhibitor peptide reduced the cytotoxic effects of bortezomib/
CX-4945 treatment. Overall, our findings demonstrated that CK2 inhibition could be
useful in combination with bortezomib as a novel therapeutic strategy in both T- and
B-ALL.

INTRODUCTION

stress/UPR elicitation is involved in bortezomib-induced
cytotoxicity [23]. Interestingly, ER stress/UPR signaling is
recently gaining increasing recognition as a key targetable
pathway in ALL [24-27].
CX-4945 is a potent and selective small molecule
inhibitor of the casein kinase 2 (CK2), currently used
in phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced
solid cancers (NCT00891280) and in MM patients
(NCT01199718). CK2 is a pivotal pro-survival protein
kinase that creates a cellular environment positive to
neoplastic cells by phosphorylating an impressive number
of substrates [28]. CK2 targets IKK/NF-κB signaling [2830], the Akt pathway [31], and the ER stress/UPR axis
[26, 32, 33]. We have recently demonstrated that CK2
inhibition by CX-4945 potently down-regulated UPR
signaling in T-ALL preclinical models [26]. Recently, the
efficacy of a bortezomib/CX-4945 combination has been
described in a study on MM and MCL cells [34]. In the
present work, we explored the synergistic cytotoxic effects
of a bortezomib/CX-4945 combination in a panel of T- and
B-ALL cell lines and lymphoblasts from T- and B-ALL
patients. Our starting hypothesis was that adding CX-4945
to leukemic cells previously exposed to bortezomib, could
prevent cancer cells from engaging the UPR in order to
effectively buffer the increased proteotoxic load in the
ER lumen, thus enhancing sensitivity to the proteasome
inhibitor. Bortezomib-induced apoptotic effects were
significantly amplified by CK2 inhibition and apoptotic
cell death was accompanied by down-regulation of ER
stress/UPR signaling. Exposure to combined treatment
provoked a reduction of pro-survival ER chaperon BIP/
Grp78 expression, the main activator of the UPR and
a well-known facilitator of tumor cell evasion from
chemotherapeutics. We also demonstrated that modulation
of NF-κB pathway was involved in bortezomib/CX-4945
mechanisms of action. However, in B-ALL cell lines and
patient lymphoblasts, the drug combination was able to
unleash NF-κB pro-apoptotic ability. Overall, our findings
provided a rationale for the use of CK2 inhibitors in
bortezomib-based combination protocols in ALL.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant
disorder that originates from hematopoietic precursors
committed to either T- or B-cell lineage. T-ALL comprises
15-20% of ALL cases, whereas B-ALL represents 8085% [1]. Overall, ALL is the most common pediatric
malignancy [2]. ALL survival rates have improved
especially in children, due to the recognition of the
biologic heterogeneity of ALL, the utilization of riskadapted therapy, and the development of protocols with
optimized chemotherapy combinations. However, relapsed
ALL is difficult to treat [3]. Therapy for relapsed pediatric
ALL is hindered by low remission rates and high toxicity,
especially in second and subsequent relapses within
three years of diagnosis [4-6]. Therapeutic alternatives
with effective anti-leukemic potential and lower toxicity
profile are needed for these extensively pretreated patients.
Currently, several new treatment options for relapsed
ALL have emerged, including deoxyadenosine analogs
(clofarabine and nelarabine), monoclonal antibodies
(alemtuzumab and epratuzumab), and the proteasome
inhibitor, bortezomib [3, 7].
Bortezomib (Velcade, formerly PS-341) is the
first proteasome inhibitor approved by the U.S. FDA for
multiple myeloma (MM) [8, 9], and, more recently, for
relapsed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) treatment [10].
Bortezomib is a dipeptidyl boronic acid analog that
reversibly inhibits the 26S proteasome. The proteasome
has been successfully targeted for the treatment of MM and
MCL but, in other hematologic malignancies, bortezomib
has been less effective as a single agent. However, phase
I studies of Children’s Oncology Group and Pediatric
Preclinical Testing Program have demonstrated that,
in refractory and/or relapsed ALL, bortezomib could
act as a chemosensitizing agent [11-13]. In particular,
the Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia
& Lymphoma (TACL) phase I and II studies have
documented that bortezomib is able to restore sensitivity
of leukemic cells to conventional dexamethasone,
asparaginase, vincristine, doxorubicin, and cytarabine
chemotherapy [14]. Moreover, about twenty therapeutic
targeted small molecules are currently being assessed in
combination with bortezomib in more than 40 ongoing
early-phase clinical trials. The majority of the studies are
evaluating patients with hematologic malignancies and
have demonstrated that bortezomib displays an excellent
synergistic activity with deacetylase inhibitors [15], kinase
inhibitors [16, 17], and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
modulators [18, 19].
Bortezomib molecular mechanisms of action in ALL
are still not completely understood. Previous reports have
highlighted that, in most cases, it could affect activation
of the NF-κB pathway through IκBα stabilization [20,
21], but it also up-regulated NF-κB activity [22]. In MM
cells, it has been shown that a terminal pro-apoptotic ER

RESULTS
A bortezomib/CX-4945 combined treatment
induces synergistic apoptotic effects in T- and
B-ALL cell lines
We investigated whether CK2 and proteasome
inhibition could cause synergistic effects in terms of
reduced cell viability in ALL models. To this end, T(MOLT-4, JURKAT, CEM-R) and B- (KOPN-8, RS4;11,
NALM-6) ALL cell lines were incubated for 46 h total
with either one drug alone or with a combination (6 h
of pre-treatment with bortezomib, followed by adding
1324

of CX-4945 for 40 h) of two drugs at a constant ratio
of 1:2000 (bortezomib:CX). Cell viability rates and
C.I.s were then calculated. The combined treatment was
strongly synergistic, as indicated by C.I.s well below 1,
except for some CIs of CEM-R and NALM-6 cells (Figure
1A). Notably, synergistic effects were not observed after
simultaneous combined treatment with bortezomib and
CX-4945 (data not shown). To further evaluate whether
the observed effects of bortezomib/CX-4945 treatment on
cell viability could be related to apoptosis, flow cytometry
analysis was performed. Cells were treated for 24 h with
bortezomib (2.5 nM) and CX-4945 (5 µM) either alone
or in combination (6 h of pre-treatment with bortezomib,
followed by adding of CX-4945 for 18 h). We detected
a statistically significant increase in the percentage of
early apoptotic (single positive for Annexin V) and/or late
apoptotic (double positive for Annexin V and PI) cells
after drug combination treatment as compared with single
treatments, especially in MOLT-4, KOPN-8 and RS4;11
cell lines (Figure 1B).

decreased at 16 and 24 h, as confirmed by Rel.Ind. values.
Pro-apoptotic Bax accumulation could be observed after
24 h of combined treatment, while Bak increase occurred
earlier, already after 6 h of treatment. To better analyze
mitochondrial involvement, we studied mitochondrial
membrane potential by flow cytometry analysis of JC-1
dye [37] in RS4;11 cell line. As shown in Supplementary
Figure S1, after 16 h of treatment, the drug combination
was able to diminish red JC-1 fluorescence more than
single treatments. Taken together, our findings indicated
that bortezomib and CX-4945 cooperated to induce
apoptotic cell death in ALL cells. Disrupted balance of
Bcl-2 family members, mitochondrial depolarization and
caspase-4 cleavage suggested the involvement of both
mitochondrial and ER-stress mechanisms, respectively.
The cleavage of caspase-8 could suggest the involvement
of death receptor mechanism, therefore this pathway needs
to be studied in more depth.

Bortezomib/CX-4945 combination affects ER
stress/UPR signaling

Apoptosis induced by the bortezomib/CX-4945
combination has mitochondrial and ER-stress
implications

It is emerging that down-regulation of UPR
signaling pathway drives apoptotic cell death also in preclinical settings of T-ALL [24, 26]. In contrast, bortezomib,
causing ER lumen overload, is known to potently induce
ER stress response [23, 36]. To better understand the
molecular determinants of apoptosis induced by such
opposing stimuli in ALL cell lines, we studied by western
blot analysis the effects of bortezomib/CX-4945 combined
treatment on ER stress/UPR markers expression.
Regarding BIP/Grp78, a well-known mediator of the UPR
pro-survival arm [38], we found that CX-4945 caused a
time-dependent decrease of protein expression in all cell
lines, whereas bortezomib rather induced an increase in
almost all cell lines (MOLT-4 and CEM-R at 6 h, KOPN8 and RS4;11 at all times of treatment, NALM-6 at 24 h)
(Figure 3A). Intriguingly in combination with bortezomib,
CX-4945 was able to overcome the opposite effect of the
proteasome inhibitor, that reportedly is strongly correlated
to resistance to bortezomib [18], leading to a stronger and
more lasting BIP/Grp78 decrease. Densitometry analysis
confirmed these observations (Figure 3A). In contrast, the
expression of IRE1α, CHOP, Thr980 p-PERK and Ser51
p-EIF2α increased, to a different extent depending on
the cell line, after exposure to CX-4945 and bortezomib
as single treatments. This indicated for both drugs a
concomitant induction of a significant stress in the ER
lumen, as IRE1α, CHOP, p-PERK and p-EIF2α are
well-established markers of ER stress/UPR-mediated
apoptosis [39]. However, the combined treatment was able
to induce an enhancement of the levels of these markers
more markedly than single drugs, within the 24 h of
treatment (Figure 3A). Therefore, our data suggested that
sequential adding of CX-4945 after a previous exposure

Apoptosis induction was further assessed by
western blot analysis of caspase-8, caspase-3 and poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. The drug
combination was able to induce a more significant timedependent cleavage of the three proteins, compared to
single agent treatment. The time of maximum cleavage
was different, depending on the cell line (Figure 2A).
Cleaved PARP was quantified using densitometry
scanning and results were showed as Relative Induction
values (Rel.Ind.), the amount of protein present in treated
samples relative to untreated cells after normalizing
to actin band density. Given the roles played by both
bortezomib [23, 35] and CX-4945 [26, 32] in ER stress/
UPR mechanisms, we also analyzed in MOLT-4, KOPN8 and RS4;11 cells, caspase-4 cleavage, a known marker
of ER stress [36]. After 16 h of treatment, the drug
combination caused a more marked cleavage than single
drugs (Figure 2A). Mitochondrial involvement was also
investigated through western blot analysis of Bcl-2 family
members expression. As shown in Figure 2B, bortezomib/
CX-4945 combination caused a time-dependent reduction
of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl1 as compared
with single treatments, to a different extent depending on
the cell line. In particular, in T-ALL cells and in NALM-6
cells, Bcl-2 down-modulation occurred already after 6 h
of treatment, while in KOPN-8 and RS4;11 the decrease
was detected after 24 h of treatment. Bcl-XL decreased
already after 6 h in all cell lines. The same occurred for
Mcl1 expression, except in JURKAT cells where, after 6
h of combined treatment, Mcl1 level increased and then

to bortezomib, could prevent ALL cells from buffering
a stressed, overloaded ER lumen with a functional UPR,
thus leading cells to apoptotic death more efficiently as
compared with single agents. It has been reported [40]
in MCL patient cells and in a mouse model of MCL
xenotransplantation, that BIP/Grp78 depletion via its
dissociation from Hsp90/BIP complexes led to inhibition
of UPR and to apoptosis. Moreover, it is well known
that CK2 inhibition, through dephosphorylation of Ser13
p-Cdc37, a Hsp90 co-chaperone, is able to impair Hsp90
activity [33]. To understand if BIP/Grp78 depletion,
observed after the bortezomib/CX-4945 combined
treatment, could be related to an impairment of the BIP/
Hsp90/Cdc37 complex, we immunoprecipitated Hsp90
and we analyzed, by western blot, its association with
BIP/Grp78 and Cdc37. In both MOLT-4 and RS4;11 cells,
the combined treatment inhibited the interactions between
Hsp90 and BIP/Grp78 more effectively than CX-4945
single treatment and to the same extent as tanespimycin
(17-AAG), a specific Hsp90 inhibitor (Figure 3B). In

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

contrast, bortezomib alone increased the association
between Hsp90 and BIP/Grp78, as previously reported
[18]. The levels of Cdc37 immunoprecipitated with
Hsp90 followed the same trend of BIP/Grp78. Finally,
western blot analysis of Ser13 p-Cdc37 levels confirmed
that CX-4945, alone and in combination with bortezomib,
through inhibition of Cdc37 phosphorylation, may drive
the impairment of Hsp90 activity, leading to Hsp90/
BIP dissociation, BIP/Grp78 depletion, and consequent
inhibition of UPR. Densitometry analysis gives a
quantitative support to these observations.

and the combination of the two drugs on STAT3 and NFκB p65 phosphorylation in ALL cell lines. Western blot
analysis documented that CK2 inhibition by CX-4945
caused a reduction in Ser727 p-STAT3 (a known target
of CK2 dependent phosphorylation) and also in Tyr705
p-STAT3 levels and this inhibition was potentiated after
the exposure to the drug combination (Figure 4A). This
finding correlates with previous observations obtained
in MM and MCL preclinical settings [34]. Levels of
Ser529 p-NF-κB, another known target site of CK2dependent phosphorylation, decreased, as expected,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in a time-dependent manner after CX-4945 exposure.
Bortezomib increased phosphorylation at this residue
(except for RS4;11 cells) but, intriguingly, the combined
treatment within 24 h down-regulated Ser529 p-NF-κB
more efficiently than CX-4945 alone, in all ALL cell lines
(Figure 4B). Ser536 p-NF-κB levels displayed a different
trend. In T-ALL cell lines (MOLT-4 and JURKAT) we
observed a reduction of Ser536 phosphorylation after the
combined treatment, with respect to single agents, while
in B-ALL cell lines (KOPN-8 and RS4;11), Ser536 p-NFκB was markedly induced by the bortezomib/CX-4945

combination (Figure 4B). Moreover, in T-ALL cell lines
dephosphorylation of Ser536 p-NF-κB correlated with
dephosphorylation of its inhibitor IκBα at Ser32/36 and
with the increase in total levels of IκBα. Also in B-ALL
cell lines, western blot analysis demonstrated a correlation
between the increase in Ser536 p-NF-κB, induction of
Ser32/36 p-IκBα, and reduction of total levels of IκBα.
These differences in NF-κB phosphorylation were
confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of Ser536
p-NF-κB nuclear localization. Figure 4C shows that, in
MOLT-4 cells, the bortezomib/CX-4945 combination did
not induce Ser536 p-NF-κB nuclear translocation, whereas
in RS4;11 cells the combined treatment caused a nuclear
accumulation of Ser536 p-NF-κB. Taken together, these

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

results indicate that in T-ALL cell lines the bortezomib/
CX-4945 combination induced an inhibition of the NF-κB
pathway, whereas in B-ALL cells, the combined treatment
triggered NF-κB signaling activation.

considered as an oncogenic and anti-apoptotic protein,
however a growing body of evidence suggests it could
also mediate cell death, depending on the cell context
and apoptotic stimulus type [42, 43]. NF-κB can display
its pro-apoptotic ability when it associates with histone
deacetylases (HDACs), as in this way NF-κB turns from

a transcriptional activator of several anti-apoptotic genes
(Bcl-xL, XIAP, A20) to a transcriptional repressor of
such genes [44]. To better assess if NF-κB activation,
observed in RS4;11 cells after bortezomib/CX-4945
combined treatment, was related to acquisition of proapoptotic functions, we immunoprecipitated NF-κB

DISCUSSION

and we analyzed, by western blot, its association with
HDAC1. Figure 5A documents that bortezomib treatment
induced a small increase in Ser536 p-NF-κB/HDAC1
complex formation, but adding CX-4945 significantly
enhanced their association. To verify that p-NF-κB/
HDAC1 complex formation could result in repression
of NF-κB anti-apoptotic target genes, we analyzed both
XIAP and Bcl-xL protein expression by western blot.
In combined treatment samples (16 h) the levels of both
proteins decreased (Figure 5B). To further document the
effective contribution of NF-κB activation to the cytotoxic
effects of bortezomib/CX-4945 treatment in RS4;11 cells,
we added to the drug combination the inhibitor peptide
of NEMO (IKKγ)-binding domain (anti-NEMO). We next
performed a viable cell count assay. Adding anti-NEMO to
RS4;11 cells increased the number of viable cells, whereas
in MOLT-4, NF-κB inhibition contributed to enhance
the cytotoxic effects of the drug combination (Figure
5C). Taken together these results suggest that, in B-ALL
cells, but not in T-ALL cells, the bortezomib/CX-4945
combination triggers NF-κB activation. This activation is
in a pro-apoptotic direction, in fact inhibition of NF-κB
dampened the cytotoxic effects of the combined treatment.

Several lines of evidence have recently indicated
that CK2 represents a pivotal molecule both regulating
hematopoiesis-associated signaling cascades and driving
the growth of different blood tumors. In fact CK2 plays
a critical triggering role in several survival pathways
including the PI3K/Akt/mTOR, WNT, NF-κB, and JAKSTAT networks, both in lymphoid and myeloid tumors
[28, 45]. Preclinical evidence from studies testing the
clinical-stage CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 in hematological
malignancies, have demonstrated that there is a strong
rationale for targeting CK2 in blood cancers and supported
the initiation of clinical trials using CK2 antagonists.
Previously, we provided evidence, in pre-clinical settings
of T-ALL, that CX-4945 could induce apoptotic cell
death through down-modulation of the UPR signaling
pathway. Intriguingly, we have also demonstrated that
a combination of CX-4945 with the ER stress inducer,
thapsigargin, was synergistic in killing T-ALL cells [26].
ER stress and UPR pathways are activated in a wide
variety of tumor types and have been demonstrated to be
essential for tumor cell survival [46]. Although ER stress
represents only one of the several processes associated
with bortezomib-induced cell death [47], it is conceivable
that it could indeed represent the key component [48, 49].
Acquisition of a more powerful UPR, due to deregulated
expression of several heat shock protein family members,
has been strongly associated with bortezomib resistance
in a wide range of B-cell malignancies [38, 50, 51]. In the
present study, we documented, in a panel of T- and B-ALL
cell lines and primary samples, that bortezomib-dependent
pro-apoptotic effects were significantly amplified by
CX-4945 mediated inhibition of CK2. Apoptosis was
accompanied by inhibition of UPR signaling, as evidenced
by down-regulation of pro-survival ER chaperon BIP/
Grp78. BIP/Grp78, when expressed at high levels, is
involved in aggressive phenotype and chemoresistance in
both proliferating and dormant cancer cells and it has been
strongly correlated to resistance to bortezomib [40, 5254]. We described that the combined treatment provoked
BIP/Grp78 depletion, via decrease of the chaperoning
activity of Hsp90. This is in agreement with findings
obtained in MCL settings [40] and may explain the
efficacy of heat shock protein inhibitors in combination
with bortezomib [55-57]. Our observations indicated that
dephosphorylation of co-chaperone Cdc37 at Ser13, which
is CX-4945 mediated, seems to be the driving force for
the impairment of BIP/Hsp90/Cdc37 complex, similarly
to the findings of others for IRE1α [33]. Bortezomib/CX4945 combination also induced ER stress more efficiently
than single treatments, as demonstrated by up-regulation
of IRE1α, CHOP, p-PERK and p-EIF2α expression
levels. Thus, we hypothesized that the adding of CX4945 after a previous bortezomib exposure, prevents
leukemic cells to adequately cope with the stronger

Bortezomib/CX-4945 combined treatment is
effective in T- and B- ALL blasts
To better assess the efficacy of the bortezomib/
CX-4945 combined treatment as a potential therapeutic
strategy in T- and B-ALL, we studied some pediatric
T-ALL and B-ALL patient samples isolated from the
bone marrow. Cells were incubated for a total of 46 h
with either single drugs or a combination (6 h of pretreatment with bortezomib, followed by adding CX4945 for 40 h) of the two drugs at a constant ratio of
1:1000 (bortezomib:CX). Cell viability rates and C.I.s
were calculated. The combined treatment displayed a
good synergism, as indicated by the C.I.s (Figure 6A).
Involvement of apoptosis, ER stress/UPR signaling,
and NF-κB activation were assessed by western blot
analysis after 16 h of treatment. Drug combination
induced cleavage of both PARP and caspase-8 as well
as a concomitant reduction of the proapoptotic BclxL, both in T- and in B-ALL lymphoblasts (Figure 6B).
Consistent with findings obtained in ALL cell lines, the
combined treatment markedly down-regulated BIP/Grp78
protein levels, except for one B-ALL patient. In T-ALL
patient lymphoblasts, the combined treatment downmodulated Ser529 p-NF-κB and was able to dampen the
increase in Ser536 p-NF-κB, and Ser32/36 p-IκBα levels
caused by bortezomib. Very interestingly, also in B-ALL
primary cells, as observed in B-ALL cell lines, the drug
combination induced Ser536 p-NF-κB and a concomitant
p-IκBα increase (Figure 6B).

ER stress by properly activating UPR signaling. This
pharmacological manipulation of ER stress is the base
of the well documented efficacy of ER stress aggravators

(ERSAs) (thapsigargin, tunicamycin, nelfinavir, etc) and
has become an attractive approach for cancer therapeutic
purposes [49, 51, 58]. We also demonstrated that the

(bortezomib:CX-4945). The combined treatment resulted in a strong synergism (CIs 0.1-0.3), synergism (CIs 0.3-0.7) or moderate/slight
synergism (CIs 0.7-0.9); data are representative of three independent experiments, bars, s.d., CX, CX-4945; BZ, bortezomib. B. Western

bortezomib/CX-4945 combination was able to trigger NFκB activation in B-ALL models but not in T-ALL ones. In
particular, in the RS4;11 cell line, we observed that this
activation is in pro-apoptotic sense. The forming of the
p-NF-κB/HDAC1 complex and the down-modulation of
antiapoptotic XIAP and Bcl-xL levels may suggest the
shift of NF-κB from a transcriptional activator of antiapoptotic genes to a transcriptional repressor of them. We
do not have direct evidence that reduced expression of
these genes is the result of transcriptional repression by
Ser536 p-NF-κB/HDAC1 complex, an issue that we are
now investigating. Moreover, the reduction of cytotoxic
effects of the combined treatment in RS4;11 cells after
an anti-NEMO peptide treatment, further indicated that
the drug combination was able to unleash NF-κB proapoptotic ability. It has been assumed that cancer cells
activate NF-κB signaling in response to chemotherapy
as a pro-survival strategy [59]. In contrast, a growing
body of evidence indicates that NF-κB also has a tumorsuppressive function, which is heavily dependent on the
stimuli and cell-type context [43, 60, 61]. It should be
underlined that, despite its power to inhibit proteasome
degradation of NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, bortezomib is
already known to activate NF-κB signaling in ALLs
and IκBα degradation has been described as a calpaindependent event [62, 63]. Our observations indicated that
CK2 inhibition could facilitate this bortezomib intrinsic
ability, in B-ALL models. Very recently it has been
discovered that phosphorylation of a highly conserved
tyrosine residue, Tyr 57, in histone H2A was mediated
by the unsuspected tyrosine kinase activity of CK2 and
plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation. In fact,
either inhibition of CK2 or Tyr 57 mutation impaired
transcriptional elongation [64]. By western blotting, we
analyzed phospho-tyrosine levels in histones isolated from
RS4;11 cells treated with single drugs or with bortezomib/
CX-4945 combination. We observed that the combined
treatment was able to reduce phosphorylated tyrosine
level in a protein band corresponding to histones H2A,
more than single treatments (Supplementary Figure S2).
This finding could explain the transcriptional repression of
the anti-apoptotic genes normally activated by NF-κB in
B-ALL models. At present, we do not have an explanation
for the different behavior of NF-κB in T-ALL models.
It has been demonstrated, in AML settings, that CX4945 mediated CK2 inhibition caused a p53-dependent
apoptosis [65]. T-ALL cell lines used in this study are p53
mutated, conversely B-ALL are p53 wild type but we did
not observe a significant modulation of p53 active form
after any drug treatments (data not shown).
Finally, we demonstrated a synergistic effect of
bortezomib/CX-4945 combination also in primary cells
from T- and B-ALL patients. Apoptotic cell death occurred
through inhibition of UPR pathway and, as in the case
of cell lines, while in B-ALL patients we observed NFκB signaling activation, in T-ALL patients this did not
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

occur. These findings are consistent with previous results
describing a possible involvement of NF-κB as proapoptotic mediator in a panel of B-ALL cell lines, primary
samples, and xenograft mouse models treated with a
combination of bortezomib and HDAC inhibitors [22].
It is noteworthy that we have focused our observations
on primary cells from a subset of immature B-ALL
patients. However, when we tested the bortezomib/CX4945 combination on a subset of mature B-ALL patients,
in front of no NF-κB signaling activation, we have not
observed any synergistic apoptotic effects (data not
shown). Further experiments are necessary to establish if
activation of NF-κB pro-apoptotic ability, via p-NF-κB/
HDAC1 complex formation, plays a role in bortezomib/
CX-4945 cytotoxicity in all B-ALL or only in some
subsets of B-ALL.
In conclusion, in this work we provide evidence that
inhibition of CK2 could enhance bortezomib-mediated cell
death of ALL cells. Mechanisms involved in this synergism
are multiple and each could represent an “Achilles heel”
of cancer cell. Adding CX-4945 to bortezomib treatment
resulted in UPR pathway inhibition through deletion of
pro-survival ER chaperon BIP/Grp78 and, only in B-ALL
models, the combination released the NF-κB pro-apoptotic
ability. It is conceivable that the use of CK2 inhibitors in
bortezomib-based combination protocols in ALL settings,
could be a therapeutic opportunity, able to counteract the
occurrence of bortezomib-resistant clones.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Bortezomib, CX-4945, and tanespimycin (17-AAG)
were kindly provided by Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX,
USA). Antibody to caspase-4 and Ser529 p-NF-κB were
from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Cdc37 antibody was from
BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). All of the other
primary and secondary antibodies for western blotting
and flow cytometry analyses were from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Cell Proliferation Kit
I (MTT) was purchased from Roche Applied Science
(Penzberg, Germany). NEMO (IKKγ)-binding domain
inhibitor peptide was obtained from Imgenex (Novus
Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA).

Cell culture and primary T-and B- ALL samples
T-ALL (MOLT-4, JURKAT, drug-resistant CCRFCEM or CEM-R) and B-ALL (KOPN-8, RS4;11,
NALM-6) cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium,

Histone isolation

according to Institutional guidelines and isolated by FicollPaque (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden).
T-ALL and B-ALL lymphoblasts were cultured in RPMI
1640 containing 20% FBS and ITS (insulin-transferrinselenite).

Cells were lysed in PBS containing 0.5% Triton
X100 (TEB) supplemented with the Protease and
Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). After 10 min lysis on ice with
gentle stirring, cells were centrifuged to spin down the
nuclei. Nuclei pellet was washed in TEB and resuspended
in 0.2 N HCl over night at 4°C to extract histones. After
acid extraction, samples were centrifuged to remove
debris. Supernatant containing histone proteins was
mixed with acetone and incubated overnight at -20°C. The
precipitated material was collected by microcentrifugation
and air-dried. The acid-soluble histone fraction was
dissolved in water and quantified for western blot analysis.
Histones were immunoblotted with anti p-Tyr-100
antibody.

Cell viability analysis
MTT
(3-[4,5-Dimethylthythiazol-2-yl]-2,5Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) assays were performed
as previously reported [66]. For drug-combination
experiments, a combination index (CI) number was
calculated using the CalcuSyn software (BioSoft,
Cambridge, UK) based on the Chou and Talalay method
[67]. CI values between 0.1-0.9 define different grades of
synergism: values between 0.9-1.1 are additive, whereas
values > 1.1 are antagonistic.

Fluorescence immunocytochemistry

Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/
propidium iodide (PI) staining

Fluorescence immunocytochemistry analysis were
performed as previously described [70]. Cells were labeled
with an antibody to Ser536 p-NF-κB, which was then
detected by a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. DAPI
(4,6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride) was
used to counterstain nuclei. Images were taken under a
Zeiss Axio Imager.Z1 microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany),
with 40x/NA 0.75 optics, coupled to a computer-driven
Zeiss AxioCAM digital camera (MRm), using the Zeiss
AxioVision (version 4.5) software.

To determine the extent of apoptosis induction
after drug treatment, flow cytometric analysis of Annexin
V-FITC/PI-stained samples was performed as previously
reported [68]. All the flow cytometric analyses were
performed on an FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman, Miami,
FL, USA), with the appropriate software (CXP, Beckman).

Flow cytometry analysis of JC-1 dye
Assessment of apoptosis induction was also
obtained by detection of mitochondrial membrane
potential using the 5,59,6,69, tetrachloro-1,1’,3,3’tetraethylbenzimidazolyl carbocyanin iodide dye (JC-1)
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) according to the
manufacturer instructions.

Statistical analysis
The data are presented as the mean values from
three separate experiments±s.d. Statistical analyses were
performed using Student’s t test at a significance level of
p < 0.05 (GraphPad Prism Software).

Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation were
performed as previously detailed [69]. Cells were lysed
using the M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent,
supplemented with the Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor
Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL,
USA). BIP/Grp78 and HDAC immunoprecipitation
was carried out using Pierce Classic IP Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA), following the
manufacturer instructions. Densitometry scanning of the
bands were performed using a Chemidoc 810 Imager with
the appropriate software (UVP, Upland, CA, USA).
