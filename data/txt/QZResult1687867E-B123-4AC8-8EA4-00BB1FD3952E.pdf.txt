ABSTRACT
Monanchocidin A (MonA) is a novel alkaloid recently isolated from the marine
sponge Monanchora pulchra. The compound reveals cytotoxic activity in genitourinary
cancers including cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant germ cell tumor (GCT) cell lines,
hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate carcinoma cell lines and different
bladder carcinoma cell lines. In contrast, non-malignant cells were significantly
less sensitive. MonA is highly synergistic with cisplatin in GCT cells. Induction of
autophagy at lower and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) at higher
concentrations were identified as the dominating modes of action. Cytotoxicity and
protein degradation could be inhibited by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy.
LMP was confirmed by loss of acridine orange staining of lysosoms and by release of
cathepsin B. In conclusion, MonA exerts cytotoxiс activity by mechanisms different
from “classical” apoptosis, and could be a promising new compound to overcome
resistance to standard therapies in genitourinary malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

30-40% of patients with high risk metastatic disease
fail to achieve a long-term response due to primary or
secondary cisplatin resistance [2]. Insufficient induction
of apoptosis seems to play a major role in cisplatin
resistance (for review see [3, 4]). In prostate cancer,
patients will inevitably succumb to the disease because
of the development of resistance to treatment. Loss of

Development of resistance to standard treatment
regimens is a major challenge in the course of oncological
therapy. Although germ cell tumors (GCT) are highly
sensitive towards platin-based cytotoxic therapies [1],

Monanchora pulchra in 2010 [15]. It reveals cytotoxic
activity against THP-1, HL-60, and HeLa human cancer
cell lines at micro- and nanomolar concentrations.
However, the precise mechanism of anticancer action has
not been elucidated to date.
In this study, we characterize the cytotoxic efficacy
and the mode of action of this marine compound in human
genitourinary cancer cell lines with defined levels of
resistance against classical anti-tumor treatments such as
androgen-deprivation, docetaxel, or cisplatin.

efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy by up-regulation
or mutation of the androgen receptor, development of
resistance to docetaxel mediated by different mechanisms,
e.g. up-regulation of anti-apoptotoc protein Bcl-2 [5], and
resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamid mediated by
androgen-receptor splice variants have been associated
with disease progression [6-8]. Standard of care for
patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer are
platin-based chemotherapy regimens. However, only 50%
respond to this therapy, and more than 80% of the patients
do not achieve long term remissions [9]. Thus, new
drugs with different mechanisms of action to overcome
resistance to standard therapies are urgently needed.
A relevant percentage of cytotoxic drugs have
been developed on the basis of natural compounds and
their derivatives [10, 11]. Remarkably, the chemical
structures and variety of natural compounds found in
marine organisms differ significantly from terrestrial
plants and animals. Specific environmental conditions
such as high pressure and salt content as well as varying
pH values of the sea have been identified as possible
reasons. In addition, many organisms living in the highly
competitive environment of the sea have developed special
defense strategies to protect themselves against enemies.
Often, they produce a large variety of small molecular
substances with specific bioactive characteristics. Not
surprisingly, these substances moved into the focus of
cancer research in the past decades. Indeed, marine drugs
such as cytarabin (Ara-C), trabectedin, and eribulin are
used clinically to treat different malignancies including
leukemias, lymphomas, soft tissue sarcomas, and breast
cancer [10-14]. Monanchocidin A (MonA, Fig. 1A) is a
novel alkaloid, initially isolated from the marine sponge

RESULTS
MonA is more active against cancer cells than
against non-malignant cells
Cytotoxic activity of MonA (Fig. 1A) was evaluated
in human cancer cells and non-malignant human cells by
MTT assay and trypan blue assay. Remarkably, GCT,
prostate cancer, and bladder cancer cell lines were found
to be equally and highly sensitive to MonA (including
androgen-independent PC3 and DU145 cells), while nonmalignant cells were affected to a lower extend (Fig. 1B,
1C; Table 1).

GCT cell lines and cisplatin-resistant sublines. The cell
lines NCCIT-R and 2102EP-R exhibit resistance to
cisplatin in comparison to the original cell lines they have
been generated from (Fig. 1B; Table 1) [16, 17]. MonA
was equally cytotoxiс in all cancer cell lines. The level
of cisplatin resistance had no impact on the efficacy of
MonA (Fig. 1B; Table 1). Cytotoxicity was time- and
dose-dependent. After 48 h of treatment, the IC50 ranged
between 0.5 to 1 µM (Fig. 1D, 1E, data for NCCIT-R
cells). Interestingly, activity of cisplatin could be enhanced
by MonA. In fact, the combination treatment resulted in
strong synergistic effects in NCCIT-R cells (Fig. 1F).
Notably, the androgen-independent prostate cancer cells
PC3 and DU145 were equally sensitive to MonA as
GCT cells, while androgen-dependent LNCaP cells were
even more sensitive (Table 1). Furthermore, bladder
cancer cells, being even more resistant to cisplatin then
cisplatin-resistant GCT cells, were as sensitive to MonA

as other cancer cell lines (Fig. 1B; Table 1). For further
investigations of the mode of action, the cisplatin-resistant
NCCIT-R cell line was chosen as an example of a cell line
resistant to standard chemotherapy.

Effects of MonA on cell cycle progression and
induction of programmed cell death
After 24 h cell cycle analysis of NCCIT-R
cells treated with MonA revealed a S-phase arrest
at non-cytotoxic, and a G1-phase arrest at cytotoxic
concentrations of MonA (Fig. 2A). Hallmarks of classical
apoptosis e.g. cleaved PARP- and caspase-3 (Fig. 2B, 2C)
were detected by Western blotting analyses in a time- and
dose-dependent manner. Induction of caspase-3-cleavage
was confirmed by flow cytometry using a PE-conjugated
antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 2D). Time- and
dose-dependent phosphatidylserine externalization as well

(Fig. 2E, 2F). Note that a significant number of necrotic
cells was observed (Fig. 2E, 2F).

antagonistic effect against MonA was observed with 3-MA
pretreatment. Consequently, autophagy was suspected to
mediate the cytotoxic effect of MonA in NCCIT-R cells
(Fig. 4A). Therefore, we analyzed expression levels of
LC3B-II - a marker of autophagy [21, 22]. We found
an up-regulation of LC3B-II in NCCIT-R cells both
after long-term exposure to low concentrations (0.25
µM – 2 µM), and after short-term exposure to high
concentrations (20 µM – 50 µM) of MonA (Fig. 4B). In
addition, formation of autophagic vacuoles was observed
by electronic microscopy (Fig. 4C). Finally, pre-treatment
with 3-MA was able to suppress MonA induced protein
degradation in Western blotting and PAGE analyses
(Fig. 4D). However, pre- and co-treatment with 3-MA
did not abolish protein degradation induced by MonA at
concentrations > 2µM (48 h of treatment). Thus, MonA
exerts a different mode of action at high concentrations
and long exposure times.
The up-regulation of LC3B-II was also observed
in postate cancer cells treated with MonA, suggesting
that autophagy is a general mechanism underlying the
cytotoxic mode of action of MonA in cancer cells (Fig.
4E).

Monanchocidin A induces unselective protein
degradation
Cisplatin induces cell death via mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK) [18]. Therefore, we examined the
effect of MonA on the activity of three main MAPK. A
concentration of 50 µM of MonA was used to get a more
pronounced effect. Activation of p38 and ERK, but not
JNK was detected (Fig. 3A). Degradation of different
proteins was observed in NCCIT-R cells both after
short term exposure to high doses of MonA (30 µM - 50
µM), as well as after long-term exposure to low doses
of MonA (0.5 µM - 2 µM) (Fig. 3B, 3C). Surprisingly,
the degradation was observed not only for MAPK (total
p38, JNK, and ERK, Fig. 3A), but also for various and
unrelated long-lived proteins such as α-tubulin and β-actin
(Fig. 3B). In addition, significant changes in the protein
patterns were observed on polyacrylamide gels stained
with colloidal Coomassie Blue after PAGE. Intensive
spots occurred at the lower end of the gel in the area where
low molecular weight proteins are located (Fig. 3C).
We suspect that these changes are caused by protein
degradation induced by the compound. To assess the
composition of the spot, we performed tandem mass
spectrometry analysis of two samples picked from the
gel area with Mw ~5 kDa, both from the upper and
lower end of the spot (Fig. 3C). Several proteins were
identified. Interestingly, all of these peptides were parts
of “mother” proteins of higher molecular weight (11 –
80 kDa) (see supplementary, Table S2). Therefore, we
assume unselective protein degradation due to MonA
exposure. Notably, this protein degradation occurs before
the initiation of apoptosis. Thus, it does not depend on
classical apoptosis (Fig. 3D). It is important to note, that
non-malignant HEK 298T cells, treated with MonA for 48
h did not reveal any signs of protein degradation (Fig. 3E)

To assess whether induction of autophagy is a
common phenomenon under substances known to induce
classical apoptosis, we treated NCCIT-R cells with
docetaxel, anisomycin, and cisplatin for 48 h. None of
the drugs revealed an up-regulation of LC3B-II, while an
increase of markers of apoptosis e.g. cleavage of PARP
and caspase-3 were observed (Fig. 5A). In line with these
observations, MonA-treated cells exhibited a different
morphology (cell rounding, cytoplasm vacuolization)
compared to cisplatin treated cells (cell shrinkage,
membrane blebbing, apoptotic bodies formation) (Fig.
5B).

3-MA did not inhibit rapid and unspecific protein
degradation in NCCIT-R cells treated with MonA at high
concentrations. Permeabilization of the membranes of
lysosomes, unlashing the proteolytic activity of lysosomal
proteases may be underlying this observation. In contrast
to other metabolic processes, LMP can start shortly after
exposure to a specific compound and thus results in a
rapid protein degradation [23]. In order to evaluate if
this is the case for MonA, we used the lysosomotropic
metachromatic fluorochrome dye acridine orange
(AO) to track the integrity of lysosomes. When excited
with blue light, AO emits red fluorescence at high

Therefore we investigated the role of potential proteolytic
pathways: NCCIT-R cells were pretreated with different
inhibitors, including the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk, the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), the
lysosome inhibitor NH4Cl, the calpain inhibitor calpeptin,
the protease inhibitor leupeptin, and a cocktail of several
protease inhibitors (see Materials and Methods) before
exposure to MonA. Potential antagonism was analyzed by

green fluorescence at low concentrations (when present
in the cytosol and the nucleus, for example after LMP)
[24, 25]. We observed disappearance of red fluorescence
coupled with increased green fluorescence, indicative for
LMP induced by high concentrations of MonA (Fig. 6A).
A similar effect on NCCIT-R cells was observed with
chloroquine (CQ), a substance known to induce LMP [25,
26]. Further evidence for the induction of LMP was the
release of cathepsin B into the extracellular space, which
occurred upon treatment with MonA at concentrations of

non-malignant human cells were less sensitive to the
compound. Remarkably, we found equal activity of the
marine compound in castration-resistant and hormonesensitive prostate cancer cell lines, as well as in cisplatinresistant and -sensitive GCT cell lines, suggesting that
MonA is active even if standard treatment regimens fail.
MonA induced programmed cell death and a G1and S-phase cell cycle arrest in GCT cells. However, a
more detailed examination revealed that not classical
apoptosis, but autophagy and/or lysosomal membrane
permeabilization are the major mechanisms leading to
cell death.
Macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy in the
following) is the basic cellular catabolic process of nonselective bulk degradation of damaged or long-lived
proteins, organelles or/and cytoplasm by lysosomes
[27-29]. It results from cellular stress, e.g. nutrient
deprivation [30], and includes the formation of doublemembrane vesicles (autophagosomes), cytoplasmic
constituents engulfing and finally fusing with lysosomes,
leading to degradation and recycling of sequestered
contents [28]. However, the role of autophagy in tumor

DISCUSSION
MonA is a novel marine compound derived from the
marine sponge Monanchora pulchra. MonA effectively
inhibits the growth of human leukemia cell lines HL60 and THP-1, presumably by induction of apoptosis
[15]. However, to date, efficacy and mode of action of
MonA in solid tumors remain elusive. We were able to
show that MonA exerts high cytotoxicity in human GCT,

growth and suppression is controversial. In fact, opposite
activity has been observed depending on different cell
types and stimuli [30]. Autophagy has been found to be
cytoprotective, cytotoxic, cytostatic, or even without any
effect on cell survival [30-32]. However, the antitumor
effects of several drugs, such as tyrosine kinases or mTOR
inhibitors (for review see [28]) involve the induction of
cytotoxic autophagy, also called type II programmed cell
death [33].
In fact, unspecific degradation of various proteins
occurred in our analyses following short-term treatment
with high concentrations, or long-term treatment with
low concentrations of MonA. Remarkably, protein

degradation induced by long-term treatment could be
inhibited by the selective autophagy inhibitor 3-MA [34].
In addition, autophagic vacuole formation after exposure
to low concentrations of MonA and the up-regulation of
the autophagy marker LC3B-II strongly suggest that the
compound is an inductor of autophagy. In contrast, other
cytotoxic substances such as docetaxel, or cisplatin, did
not induce an up-regulation of LC3B-II in NCCIT-R. Thus,
as expected, apoptosis, but not autophagy, is the central
mechanism of action of these substances. Observation
of hallmarks of apoptosis following MonA treatment is
assumed to be a secondary event [23], because they appear
after, but not simultaneously with protein degradation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

At high concentrations > 2 µM, the dominating
mechanism of protein degradation (and therefore
of cell death) of MonA was lysosomal membrane
permeabilization (LMP). During LMP, cathepsins and
other hydrolases are released from the lysosomal lumen
into the cytosol, leading to unselective degradation of
cellular components [25]. LMP is a potentially lethal
event, because the presence of lysosomal proteases in the
cytosol causes digestion of vital proteins and the activation
of caspases and other hydrolases [35, 36]. However, cell
death resulting from massive LMP can also show necrosislike features and be caspase-independent [25, 37]. In our
experiments, we found loss of lysosomal integrity as well
as release of cathepsin B into extracellular space in cells
treated with ≥ 2 µM MonA, supporting the idea of LMP
induction.
Inhibitors of lysosomal activity and proteases were
able to inhibit the cytotoxic effect of MonA to a certain
degree. This also suggests that autophagy and induction
of LMP are relevant for MonA activity, as both processes
require active lysosoms and cathepsins. The moderate
antagonistic effect of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk indicates caspases activation, most likely as a rather
late event. Caspase activation could result from direct
cleavage of caspases by cathepsins, or be an indirect
down-stream effect of autophagy and/or LMP. It should
be noted that z-VAD-fmk can also inhibit other cysteine
proteases including several cathepsins [38], which - at
least in part - explains the antagonistic effect of z-VADfmk in MonA-treated cells.
Interestingly, induction of autophagy as the
mechanism underlying cytotoxicity has never been
reported before in GCT cells, while its induction in
prostate cancer and bladder cancer cells is a known and
well characterized phenomenon. It is induced by a number
of anticancer drugs such as rapamycin, everolimus,
metformin, and neuregulin (for review see [33, 39]). In our
experiments, we have observed the induction of autophagy
in both GCT and prostate cancer cells treated with MonA.
As the mechanism of action of MonA strongly differs
from standard agents used to treat these tumors [40],
MonA might be a promising new substance capable of
overcoming resistance against currently applied therapies
[23, 33]. In addition, MonA may be able to enhance the
activity of cisplatin in GCT cells, as synergistic effects
were observed when cisplatin and MonA were combined
in NCCIT-R cells. This is in line with the previous findings
that LMP can promote and increase induction of apoptosis
[35].
In conclusion, MonA is a highly effective marine
compound, which holds promise of therapeutic activity
in genitourinary cancers even if standard therapies fail.
This is most likely due the distinct different mechanism
of action when compared to standard chemotherapies,
namely drug-induced autophagy and LMP.

3-methyladenine and z-VAD(OMe)-fmk (referred here
as z-VAD-fmk) from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale,
NY, USA), leupeptin from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany),
protease inhibitors cocktail (cOmplete Mini EDTAfree) from Roche (Munnheim, Germany). Primary and
secondary antibodies used are listed in the supplementary.

Cell lines and culture conditions
The human prostate cancer cell lines PC3
(docetaxel resistant, androgen-independent), DU145
(docetaxel sensitive, androgen-independent), LNCaP
(docetaxel sensitive, androgen-dependent) [41, 42],
human bladder cancer cell lines RT112, RT4, 486p, T24,
human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293T, human
embilical vascular endothelium cell line HUVEC, as
well as human fibroblast cell lines MRC-5 and MRC-9
were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The
human germ cell tumor cancer cell line NCCIT was
obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). TCam2 and 2102EP cells were kindly provided by Prof. L.
Looijenga (Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The cisplatinresistant sublines NCCIT-R and 2102EP-R have been
generated as reported before [16, 17]. Cells were cultured
according to the manufacturers instructions (culture
conditions are described in the supplementary). Cells
were continuously kept in culture for a maximum of 3
months, and were routinely inspected microscopically for
stable phenotype and regularly checked for contamination
with mycoplasma. Cell line authentication was performed
by DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) using highly
polymorphic short tandem repeat loci.

In vitro MTT-based drug sensitivity assay
The in vitro cytotoxicity of individual substances
and drug combinations was evaluated using the MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) assay, which was performed as previously
described [43].

Examination of synergistic/antagonistic effect of
drug combination

Protein identification by mass spectrometry
Protein spots of interest were excised from the gel
and digested manually with trypsin. Mass spectrometry
measurements and identification were performed as
previously described [46]. The peptide solutions were
analyzed using a Proxeon nano-LC system equipped
with a nano-ESI source (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark)
connected to a LTQ-Orbitrap-MS (ThermoElectron,
Bremen, Germany). For protein identification, automated
database searches using the Sequest algorithm rel. 27.11
(Sorcerer built 4.05, Sage-N Research Inc., Milpitas, CA)
were performed using a Swiss-Prot database rel. 2013_10
(limited to human entries). The considered enzyme
specificity was fully tryptic. Parent mass tolerance (MS)
was set to 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerance 1 Da.
Methionine oxidation and propionamid were considered
as optional modification. Protein identification was based
on a) peptide length of 5, peptide probability: 95.0%
minimum and sequest: deltaCn scores of greater than
0.1 and XCorr scores of greater than 2.3, 3.8 and 3.8
for doubly, triply, and quadruply charged peptides and
b) protein thresholds: 95.0% minimum and 3 peptides
minimum.

Determination of synergistic or antagonistic drug
effects in combination assays was performed using the
Chou-Talalay method [20]. Data were generated by MTT
assay. The combinational index (CI) was calculated for the
constant drugs ratio with the CompuSyn v.1.0. software
(ComboSyn, Inc., Paramus, NJ, USA). Synergism is
defined as a CI < 1, whereas antagonism is defined
by a CI > 1. The MTT assay was used to examine the
combination of MonA at the IC50 with defined inhibitors
of autophagy or LMP, or with the IC50 of cisplatin. Doses
of the drugs used for combination treatment are shown
in the supplementary (Table S3). All experiments were
performed in triplicates and were repeated at least three
times.

In vitro trypan blue-based viability assay
The in vitro effect of MonA on cell viability was
evaluated by trypan blue exclusion assay using semiautomated cell count with a Beckman Coulter Vi-CELL
(Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) as described before
[43].

Detection of apoptotic cells by annexin-V-FITC /
PI double staining

Protein preparation and western blotting

Induction of apoptosis was examined using FACSbased analysis with an annexin-V-FITC (BD Bioscience,
San Jose, CA, USA) and propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma)
double staining. The experiment was performed as
previously described [47].

Preparation of protein extracts and Western
blotting were performed as described previously with
slight modifications [44]. In brief, 1 × 106 cells/well
were seeded in Petri dishes (ø 6 cm, 5 mL/dish). Cells
were harvested, proteins were extracted, subjected to
electrophoresis in 10-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels at
120 V, and transferred from gel to a 0.2 µm pore PVDF
membrane. The membrane was blocked and incubated
with the primary antibody according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (for antibodies used, see the supplementary).
After washing, the membranes were incubated with the
corresponding secondary antibody for 1 h at RT. Signals
were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence system
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Cell cycle analysis
The cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow
cytometry using PI staining as described before [45] with
slight modifications. In brief, cells were pre-incubated
overnight in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well). The
medium was changed to 0.1% FBS/DMEM medium
(DMEM/GlutamaxTM-I medium containing 0.1% FBS
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). After 24 h of incubation,
the medium was changed to normal 10% FBS/DMEM
medium containing different concentrations of the
substances examined. After 24 h of treatment, cells were
harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution, fixed, stained,
and analyzed. The results were quantitatively analyzed
using the FlowJo software, v.7 (Treestar Inc, Ashland,
OR, USA).

Staining of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels with
Coomassie brilliant blue
SDS-polyacrylamide gels were prepared as
described above. Dye-free loading buffer was used for the
protein samples preparation. Gels were fixed and stained
with colloidal Coomassie Blue overnight, destained, and
digitalized as previously described [45].

Detection of activated caspase-3 by FACS

Red fluorescence measurements and quantification were
performed with Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, USA).

To assess occurrence of caspase-3 cleavage, FACSbased analysis with a cleaved caspase-3 specific, PE-linked
antibody (BD Bioscience) was used. NCCIT-R cells were
pre-incubated overnight in 6-well plates (2 x 105 cells/
well). The medium was replaced by a medium containing
different concentrations of the substances examined. After
48 h of treatment, cells were harvested with a trypsinEDTA solution, washed twice with PBS, and fixated
with 2% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 10 min at 37°C.
After incubation on ice for 1 min, cells were pelleted
by centrifugation for 5 min at 453 x g, resuspended in 1
mL of 90% methanol, and incubated for 30 min at 4°C.
Then 0.5 mL of 0.5% BSA/PBS were added, cells were
pelleted (10 min at 453 x g), resuspended in 50 µL of 0.5%
BSA/PBS, and incubated for 10 min at RT. 1 µL of either
cleaved caspase-3 specific, PE-linked antibody, or PElinked isotype control, or PBS were added followed by
incubation for 60 min at RT in the dark. Afterwards, cells
were resuspended in 0.5 mL of 0.5% BSA/PBS, pelleted
(10 min at 453 x g), resuspended in 0.3 mL of PBS, and
analyzed using the FACS Calibur (BD Bioscience). The
results were analyzed using the BD Bioscience Cell Quest
Pro software (BD Bioscience).

Detection of cathepsin B release
To assess release of cathepsin B into the
extracellular space, NCCIT-R cells were pre-incubated
overnight in 6-well plates (2 x 105 cells/well), and were
then treated with MonA for 48 h. After trypsination, cells
were immobilized on glass slides using the cytospin
method and dried overnight. Cells were fixed with 2%
(w/v) PFA/PBS, washed with PBS and permeabilized with
0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 solution in 2% (v/v) normal goat
serum/PBS for 30 min. After washing with PBS, samples
were treated with 1:400 rabbit anti-cathepsin B antibody
solution (in 0.1% (w/v) NaN3; 0.2% (w/v) BSA in PBS,
pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C, washed with PBS and incubated
with secondary anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
antibody solution in PSB for 1 h at RT. Then, samples
were washed with PBS, covered with DAPI-based
ProLong® Gold reagent (Life Technologies) and directly
analyzed with AxioScope.A1 (Carl Zeiss) microscope and
with the AxioVision40 V4.8 software (Carl Zeiss Imaging
Solutions).

Statistical analysis

Light microscopy

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism software v. 5.01 (GraphPad Prism software Inc.,
La Jolla, CA, USA). Data are presented as mean ±SEM
(standard error of the mean). All the experiments were
performed in triplicates and repeated at least three times.
The unpaired Student’s t-test was used for comparison of
two groups. Differences were considered to be statistically
significant if p < 0.05.

Microphotographs of cells were taken using
Axiovert 25 microscope and an AxioCam MRc camera
(Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) at x400 magnification.

Electronic microscopy
For electron microscopy, untreated and treated
NCCIT-R cells were fixed using glutaraldehyde and
embedded in Epon-Araldite. Then, semithin and ultrathin
sections were cut and analysed using a Zeiss microscope
EM 906 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at various
magnifications.
