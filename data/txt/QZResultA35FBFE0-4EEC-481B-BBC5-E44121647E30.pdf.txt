Abstract
Rhabdomyosarcoma frequently infiltrates bone marrow and
this process involves the stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)–
CXCR4 axis. Because leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), like SDF1, is secreted by bone marrow stroma and directs the
regeneration of skeletal muscles, we examined whether the
LIF–LIF receptor (LIF-R) axis affects the biology of rhabdomyosarcoma cells. We found that in rhabdomyosarcoma cells,
LIF stimulates the following: (a) phosphorylation of mitogenactivated protein kinase p42/44, AKT, and signal transducers
and activators of transcription 3, (b) adhesion and chemotaxis,
and (c) increased resistance to cytostatics. To compare the
biological effects of LIF versus SDF-1, we examined the RH30
cell line, which is highly responsive to both ligands, and found
that the chemotaxis of these cells is significantly reduced when
the inhibitors of both receptors (T140 for CXCR4 and gp190
blocking antibody for LIF-R) are added simultaneously.
Subsequently, by using repetitive chemotaxis to LIF or SDF-1,
we selected from the RH30 line subpopulations of cells that
respond to LIF but not SDF-1 (RH30-L) or to SDF-1 but not LIF
(RH30-S). We found that (a) RH30-L cells seed better to the
bone marrow, liver, and lymph nodes of immunodeficient mice
than RH30-S cells and (b) mice inoculated i.m. with the RH30-L
cells had more rhabdomyosarcoma cells in the bone marrow
and lung after 6 weeks. Thus, we present the first evidence that
the LIF–LIF-R axis may direct rhabdomyosarcoma metastasis.
Further, because we showed that the in vivo metastasis of RH30
cells is inhibited by small interfering RNA against LIF-R,
molecular targeting of this axis could become a new strategy
to control the metastasis of rhabdomyosarcoma. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of
adolescence and childhood and accounts for 5% of all malignant
tumors in patients under 15 years of age (1–10). There are two
major histologic subtypes of rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS).
Clinical evidence indicates that ARMS is more aggressive, has a
significantly worse outcome than ERMS, and in almost all cases is
associated with bone marrow involvement. Moreover, ARMS is
characterized by the translocation t(2;13)(q35;q14) in 70% of cases

or the variant t(1;13)(p36;q14) in a smaller percentage of cases.
These translocations disrupt the PAX3 and PAX7 genes on chromosome 2 and 1, respectively, and the FKHR gene on chromosome
13, and generate PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR fusion genes (7–10).
These fusion genes encode the fusion proteins PAX3-FKHR and
PAX7-FKHR, believed to play a role in cell survival and dysregulation of the cell cycle in ARMS cells (1–10).
Why rhabdomyosarcoma cells metastasize to the bone marrow
is still poorly understood. There is increasing evidence that bone
marrow stroma secretes chemoattractants, which attract rhabdomyosarcoma cells into the bone marrow microenvironment where
they find conditions favorable for survival and expansion. We and
others showed that the a-chemokine stromal-derived factor-1
(SDF-1) and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) are
secreted by bone marrow stroma and, along with their respective
receptors CXCR4 and c-met, are expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma
cells and play an important role in the metastasis of rhabdomyosarcoma (11–14). Although both SDF-1 and HGF chemoattracted
rhabdomyosarcoma cells and enhanced their metastatic behavior
(11, 14), surprisingly, blockage of both the SDF-1–CXCR4 and the
HGF–c-met axes did not completely inhibit the chemotaxis of these
cells to conditioned medium by bone marrow stroma or lymph
nodes, suggesting the involvement of other chemoattractants as
potential prometastatic factors in rhabdomyosarcoma.
Based on observations that the gp190 signaling cytokine,
leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), stimulates proliferation of skeletal
muscle satellite cells and myocytes (15, 16), as well as cardiomyocytes (17), and that normal bone marrow stroma cells express and
secrete LIF (18), we hypothesized that the LIF–LIF receptor (LIF-R)
axis is such a prometastatic factor promoting the progression of
rhabdomyosarcoma. Furthermore, because oncostatin M (OSM),
another cytokine in the gp190 signaling family, also binds to LIF-R,
we also examined the possibility of the involvement of this
molecule. We looked at the biological responses of LIF-R–positive
ARMS and ERMS cell lines to stimulation by exogenous LIF or
OSM, such as phosphorylation of signaling proteins, cell proliferation, survival of rhabdomyosarcoma cells exposed to chemotherapy, adhesion, chemotaxis, chemoinvasion, and expression of
matrix metalloproteinases (MMP).
Our findings provide evidence for first time that the LIF–LIF-R
(cytokine–gp190 signaling receptor axis) regulates the metastatic
behavior of rhabdomyosarcoma cells and their metastasis to the
bone marrow and suggest that it could also contribute to their
resistance to conventional methods of treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. We used human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (gift of Dr.
Peter Houghton, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN)
comprising ARMS lines (RH1, RH28, RH30, and CW9019) and ERMS lines

(RH18, RD, and SMS-CTR), all established at St. Jude Hospital (Memphis,
TN; ref. 5). The ERMS cell line, RD, was transfected with the PAX3-FKHR
gene (gift of Dr. Frederic G. Barr; ref. 11).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. The expression of gp190
protein, a common subunit for LIF-R, on various rhabdomyosarcoma cell
lines and of both gp190 and CXCR4 on isolated subpopulations of the RH30
cell line was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as
described previously (11, 14). The gp190 antigen was detected with antigp190 monoclonal antibody (mAb; Becton Dickinson PharMingen, San
Diego, CA), clone 12D3, phycoerythrin conjugated, and CXCR4 was detected
with mAb (Becton Dickinson PharMingen), clone 12G5, phycoerythrin
conjugated. Samples stained with appropriate isotype controls (Becton
Dickinson PharMingen) were examined in parallel.
Detection of LIF-R by Western blot. LIF-R was detected by protein
immunoblotting (11) using rabbit anti–LIF-R antibody (clone C19; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–
conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as secondary
antibodies. Equal loading in the lanes was evaluated by stripping the blots
and reprobing them with rabbit anti-AKT protein (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA). The membranes were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, United
Kingdom), dried, and exposed to film (HyperFilm, Amersham Life Sciences).

signaling protein. The most efficient inhibition was observed when all these
inhibitors were used together. Data from four separate experiments are pooled

Phosphorylation of intracellular pathway proteins. Rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines were kept in RPMI 1640 containing low levels of bovine
serum albumin (BSA) (0.5%) to render them quiescent and then divided and
stimulated with optimal doses of LIF (100 ng/mL) or OSM (100 ng/mL) for
5 min at 37jC before lysing for 10 min on ice in M-Per lysing buffer (Pierce,
Rockford, IL) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma,
Milwaukee, WI). Subsequently, the extracted proteins were separated on a
10% SDS-PAGE gel, and the fractionated proteins were transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) as described
previously (11, 14). Phosphorylation of the intracellular kinases, 44/42
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; Thr202/Tyr204), AKT (Ser473), and
signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3; Tyr705) proteins
was detected using commercial mouse phospho-specific mAb (p44/42) or
rabbit phospho-specific polyclonal antibodies for each of the remainder
(all from New England Biolabs) with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
or goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
as described (11, 14). Equal loading in the lanes was evaluated by stripping
the blots and reprobing with appropriate mAbs: p42/44 anti-MAPK
antibody clone 9102, anti-AKT antibody clone 9272, and anti-STAT3 (New
England Biolabs). The membranes were developed with an ECL reagent,
dried, and subsequently exposed to film (HyperFilm).
Transmembrane chemotaxis. The 8-Am pore polycarbonate membranes were covered with 50 AL of 0.5% gelatin. Cells were detached (with
0.5 mmol/L EDTA), washed in RPMI 1640, resuspended in RPMI 1640
with 0.5% BSA, and seeded at a density of 3  104 in 120 AL into the
upper chambers of Transwell inserts (Costar Transwell, Corning Costar,
Corning, NY). The lower chambers were filled with medium containing LIF
(100 ng/mL) or OSM (100 ng/mL) or conditioned medium or 0.5% BSA
RPMI 1640 (control). After 24 h, the inserts were removed from the
Transwells, cells remaining in the upper chambers were scraped off with
cotton wool, and cells that had transmigrated were stained by HEMA 3
(Protocol, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and counted either on the lower
side of the membranes or on the bottom of the Transwells.
Some of the directional migration experiments to conditioned medium
harvested from bone marrow–derived fibroblasts were done using cells
preincubated for 30 min at 37jC in the presence of 1 Amol/L T140truncated polyphemusin analogue (a gift from Dr. Nobutaka Fujii, Kyoto
University, Sakyo-Ku, Kyoto, Japan) and/or preincubated in the presence of
1 Amol/L c-met inhibitor, K-252a (Calbiochem-Novabiochem International,
San Diego, CA), and/or 0.5 Ag/mL anti-gp190 antibody (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN). conditioned medium from bone marrow–derived
fibroblasts was obtained from cells cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium
as described previously (11).
Adhesion of rhabdomyosarcoma cells to fibronectin, human umbilical vascular endothelial cell, or bone marrow stroma cells. Rhabdomyosarcoma cells were labeled with the fluorescent dye calcein-AM
(2 Ag/mL; Becton Dickinson BioCoat, Bedford, MA) in 37jC and 5% CO2
and subsequently seeded ( for 5 min) onto the 96-well plates covered
with fibronectin, human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC), or
bone marrow stroma cells as described (11, 19). The cells were pretreated
with LIF (100 ng/mL), OSM (100 ng/mL), or not (control or spontaneous
adhesion of isolated subpopulations). Following incubation (at 37jC), the
plates were washed thrice and cells that had adhered were counted using
fluorescent inverted microscopy (Olympus America, Melville, NY).
Survival of rhabdomyosarcoma cells in Teflon wells. To prevent
their adhesion, rhabdomyosarcoma cells were incubated for 6 h in Teflon
wells with 100 ng/mL LIF or 100 ng/mL OSM or under control conditions
(RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% BSA). Subsequently, cells were exposed for
24 h to etoposide (6 Amol/L), washed, and plated into new wells in 10%
FCS RPMI 1640 and left for 3 days. The living cells were then stained by the
fluorescent dye calcein-AM (2 Ag/mL) and the number of living cells was
determined by fluorescent inverted microscopy.
Isolation of mRNA and reverse transcription-PCR. For analysis of
LIF and OSM mRNA, total mRNA was isolated from rhabdomyosarcoma
cells with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA), and mRNA
was reverse transcribed with Taqman Reverse Transcription reagents
(Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ). The PCR was carried out with

5¶-GATGTCGGCGGTGGCGTTGAG-3¶ antisense primer and the OSM 5¶-GGCCTGCCGGTCCTTCCCTCTC-3¶ sense primer and the 5¶-AGCGCCATTTGCACCACCTGTCC antisense primer. The predicted size of the reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) product for LIF was 426 bp and for OSM was
415 bp. Amplified products (10 AL) were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose
gel and transferred to a nylon filter.
Real-time RT-PCR. Quantitative assessment of LIF-R, CXCR4, and hactin mRNA levels was done by real-time RT-PCR using an ABI Prism 7000
Sequence Detection System (ABI, Foster City, CA). Primers were designed
with Primer Express software as follows: 3¶-ATACGTAAATATCCATCATCTGTGCAA and 5¶ GGAGCCTCTGCGACTCATTCA (LIF-R); 3¶-GGGTTCCTTCATGGAGTCATAGCT and 5¶-CGGTTACCATGGAGGGGATC
(CXCR4); and 5¶-CGGAACCGCTCATTGCC-3¶ and 5¶-ACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3¶ (h-actin). A 25-AL reaction mixture containing 12.5 AL SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix and 10 ng cDNA template and primers was used.
The threshold cycle (C t; i.e., the cycle number at which the amount
of amplified gene of interest reached a fixed threshold) was subsequently
determined. Relative quantitation of LIF-R and CXCR4 mRNA expression was done with the comparative C t method as described (17). The
relative quantitation value of target, normalized to an endogenous control
b-actin (housekeeping) gene and relative to a calibrator, is expressed as
2 DDC t ( fold difference), where DC t = [C t of target genes (LIF-R and
CXCR4)] [C t of endogenous control gene (h-actin)] and DDC t = (DC t of
samples for target gene) (DC t of calibrator for the target gene).
Fluorescent staining of F-actin, focal adhesion kinase, and paxillin.
To visualize the actin cytoskeleton, cells were cultured for 12 h on glass
coverslips in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and after that the medium was removed and the cells were washed by
PBS and incubated in RPMI 1640 containing low levels of BSA (0.5%)
to render them quiescent. Next, the cells were stimulated by LIF or OSM

for 20 min, permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 min at room
temperature, and stained for 1 h with Alexa 488-phalloidin (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR) to detect F-actin, with monoclonal mouse anti-paxillin
antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and goat anti-mouse
Alexa 488 to detect paxillin and monoclonal mouse anti–focal adhesion
kinase (FAK) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and goat anti-mouse Alexa
594 (Molecular Probes) to detect FAK. Specimens were counterstained
with 0.5 Ag/mL bis-benzimide (Hoechst) to visualize the nuclei. After being
washed, the cells were embedded in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories, Peterborough, United Kingdom) and analyzed with a BX51
fluorescence microscope (Olympus America) equipped with a charge-coupled
device camera (Olympus America). Each staining was repeated thrice.
Rho activation assay. Rho activity was measured in a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line using the Rho activation assay kit according to the
manufacturer protocol (Upstate Biotechnology). Before the assay, cells were
kept in RPMI 1640 containing low levels (0.5%) of BSA to render them
quiescent and then aliquoted and stimulated by optimal doses of LIF for 1,
3, and 5 min. Cell lysates were precleared by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 5
min at 4jC) and incubated with Rhotekin binding domain-tagged agarose
(10 Ag) by gentle rocking at 4jC for 1 h. The GTP-bound form of Rho was
detected through Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-Rho
antibody (clone 55; Upstate Biotechnology).
Cell proliferation. Cells were plated in 24-well culture plates at an initial
density of 104 cells/cm2 in the presence or absence of LIF (100 ng/mL) or
OSM (100 ng/mL) and counted at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h after culture
initiation (in some experiments also at 72 h) as described (11).
Knockdown of LIF-R with small interfering RNA. We purchased
predesigned small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes for LIF-R (Genbank

GUdTdT; Qiagen). The RH30 cell line was cultured for 24 h before
transfection in Opti-MEM–reduced serum medium (Life Technologies,
Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). The siRNAs were transfected into RH30
cells at a final concentration of 100 nmol/L using LipofectAMINE 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To determine the efficiency of siRNA, at 48
h post-transfection, the transfected cells were collected to measure the
expression of LIF-R at the mRNA level by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ
PCR) and the protein level by Western blot as described above.
Transplants of rhabdomyosarcoma cells into immunodeficient
mice. To evaluate the in vivo metastatic behavior of three populations of
RH30 cell lines (RH30, RH30 -L, and RH30-S), the cells were injected i.v.
(8  106 per mouse) into immunodeficient severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-Beige inbred mice. In some experiments, mice were transplanted with RH30 cells exposed to siRNA against LIF-R, cells exposed to
scramble siRNA, or nonexposed cells. Marrows and livers were removed
48 h after injection of these cells and the presence of rhabdomyosarcoma
cells (i.e., murine-human chimerism) was evaluated as the difference in the
level of human a-satellite. DNA was amplified in the extracts isolated from
the bone marrow–derived and the liver-derived cells, using real-time PCR.
Briefly, DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen).
Detection of human a-satellite and murine h-actin DNA levels was done
using real-time PCR and an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System.

number of murine cells.
In some of the experiments, RH30-L and RH30 cells (5  106 per mouse)
were inoculated into the hind limb muscles of immunodeficient SCID-Beige
inbred mice. Six weeks later, the mice were sacrificed for evaluation of
rhabdomyosarcoma cells present in bone marrow, liver, and lungs.
Detection of human cells was done as described above.
Statistical analysis. All results are presented as mean F SE. Statistical
analysis of the data was done using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test,

LIF and OSM are expressed in bone marrow–derived stroma
cells and chemoattracted rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The
metastasis of rhabdomyosarcoma cells to the bone marrow is

Q11

LIF–LIF-R Axis in Rhabdomyosarcoma

conditioned medium could be significantly but not completely
inhibited by blocking of the CXCR4 and c-met receptors on
rhabdomyosarcoma cells or the gp190 protein (Fig. 1A). However,
when the CXCR4 antagonist (T140), the c-met blocking agent
(K252a), and the gp190 blocking antibody were used together, the
chemotaxis of the highly metastatic ARMS cell line RH30 was
inhibited completely (Fig. 1A).
To learn more of the role of gp130 signaling cytokines in
rhabdomyosarcoma metastasis, we evaluated their expression in
bone marrow–derived fibroblasts and showed that they express
several gp130 signaling cytokines (Fig. 1B) that could be potential
chemotactic factors for rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Because two
gp130 signaling cytokines, LIF and OSM, are involved in the
development of skeletal muscles (18), we asked whether these
factors play a role in directing metastases of rhabdomyosarcoma
cells to bone marrow. We found that of the five gp130 signaling
cytokines tested, only LIF and OSM efficiently stimulated
phosphorylation of STAT3 and MAPK p42/44 in RH30 cells
(Fig. 1C); therefore, we concentrated our attention on these two
cytokines in further experiments.
Rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines express functional LIF-R.
First, we phenotyped several human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines

by FACS for expression of LIF-R and found that all four ARMS
(RH1, RH28, RH30, and CW9019) and all three ERMS (RD, RH18,
and SMS-CTR) cell lines expressed mRNA for LIF-R (data not
shown) and for the gp190 protein, a common subunit for LIF-R and
OSM receptor (OSM-R; Fig. 2A). Expression of gp190 protein was
also confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2A). In our previous studies,
we observed that PAX3-FKHR overexpression in the ERMS cell line
RD correlated with up-regulation of expression of CXCR4 (11) and
c-met (14). In the current study, however, expression of mRNA for
LIF-R or of gp190 on the cell surface was not affected after RD
ERMS cells were stable transfected with the PAX3-FKHR expression
vector (data not shown).
Next, we found that stimulation of various rhabdomyosarcoma
cell lines by LIF or OSM, like the RH30 cell line (Fig. 1C), induced
the phosphorylation of STAT3 in all these cell lines (Fig. 2B). In
addition, MAPK p42/44 was phosphorylated in all and AKT was
phosphorylated in most of the cell lines tested (Fig. 2B).
LIF and OSM do not influence proliferation of rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines but may increase their survival. Next, we
examined the ARMS (RH1, RH28, RH30, and CW9019) and the
ERMS (RD, RH18, and SMS-CTR) cell lines to determine whether
LIF or OSM affects their proliferation. We stimulated them with LIF

or OSM or neither (control) in serum-free conditions or in medium
supplemented with 0.5% BSA and found that the rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines proliferated intensively during 72 h under all types
of conditions. The kinetics of proliferation were similar and not
affected by the presence of LIF or OSM in the culture, even when
the cells were cultured for up to 7 days (data not shown).
Because the biology of various tumors may be regulated by
autocrine/paracrine axes (20), we next tested whether these
rhabdomyosarcoma cells express LIF or OSM. We found that all
cell lines investigated in this study expressed mRNA for these
factors (Fig. 2C). However, blocking the putative LIF/OSM-gp190–
coupled LIF-R and OSM-R autocrine regulatory axis by adding antigp190 blocking mAb or siRNA did not affect the proliferation
kinetics of these cell lines (data not shown).
Next, we evaluated whether signaling through a gp190 receptor
enhances the survival of rhabdomyosarcoma cells. To address this
issue, we incubated two ARMS cell lines (RH30 and CW9019) in
Teflon wells, which prevents their adhesion, for 6 h with 100 ng/mL
LIF or OSM. Subsequently, both ARMS cell lines were exposed to
etoposide (6 Amol/L). After 24 h of incubation, the cells were
washed to remove the etoposide and plated in new wells in 10%
FBS RPMI 1640 for 3 days. After this, the surviving cells were
scored using the 0.4% trypan blue exclusion assay. We found that
preincubation of rhabdomyosarcoma cells with LIF or OSM
(100 ng/mL) significantly increased their survival and subsequent
expansion and that these cells were better able to proliferate after
removal from etoposide (6 Am)–containing medium, suggesting
that LIF and OSM may protect rhabdomyosarcoma cells from
chemotherapy. Accordingly, 5 and 2 more cells were observed
in cultures initiated by RH30 and CW9019 cells that were
coincubated with LIF or OSM during exposure to etoposide.
Of note, in control experiments, LIF or OSM did not affect
survival/proliferation of rhabdomyosarcoma cells incubated for 6
h in Teflon dishes, suggesting that the biological effect of these
factors correlates with cell adhesiveness.
LIF or OSM increases migration across fibronectin-covered
Transwell membranes. Next, we investigated the directed
migration of rhabdomyosarcoma cells through membranes covered
with fibronectin. We found that LIF and OSM significantly
increased the chemotactic activity of the ARMS cell lines RH28,
RH30, and CW9019 and the ERMS cell lines RH18, SMS-CTR, and
RD (Fig. 3A). This correlated with phosphorylation of MAPK p42/44
(Figs. 1C and 2B), confirming an important role for this pathway in
regulating the motility of rhabdomyosarcoma cells (11, 14).
LIF or OSM increase adhesion of rhabdomyosarcoma cells.
Cell adhesion is an important step in rhabdomyosarcoma metastasis and we found that both LIF and OSM affected the adhesion
of the rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines tested to fibronectin, HUVEC,
and bone marrow–derived fibroblasts (Fig. 3B–D). However, when
we investigated using FACS analysis whether LIF or OSM regulates
expression/activation of integrins on human rhabdomyosarcoma,
we did not find any change in the level of expression of VLA-4,
VLA-5, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, or intercellular
adhesion molecule 1 on rhabdomyosarcoma cells after incubation
with LIF or OSM for 24 h (data not shown).
LIF stimulates stress fiber formation, colocalization of FAK
and paxillin in focal contacts, and Rho activation. Next, we
focused on molecular mechanisms related to the LIF-mediated
adhesion of rhabdomyosarcoma cells. As a model, we used the
ARMS cell line CW9019 that shows enhanced migration through
fibronectin-covered membranes and strong adhesion to fibronec-

tin, HUVEC, and bone marrow–derived stroma cells (Fig. 3).
First, using immunofluorescence staining, we observed that in
serum-starved rhabdomyosarcoma cells, LIF stimulates the formation of strong F-actin bundles, which colocalized with FAK in the
filopodia (Fig. 4A). Next, we investigated whether LIF also
colocalizes paxillin and FAK in rhabdomyosarcoma cells and
found that both colocalized in focal adhesion complexes in the
filopodia after LIF stimulation (Fig. 4B). At the same time, we found
by Western blotting that Rho becomes activated in LIF-stimulated
cells (Fig. 4C).
In control experiments, LIF did not affect translocation of FAK
or paxillin to focal adhesion complexes in the ERMS cell line SMSCTR, which did not respond by increased adhesion to LIF or OSM
stimulation (data not shown).

responded robustly to one or the other chemoattractant, which we
called RH30-L and RH30-S cells, respectively. We found that the
RH30-L cells were bigger, more flattened, and adhered better to
plastic than the RH30-S cells. However, the most striking difference
was that RH30-L cells proliferated better in vitro in standard
culture medium compared not only to RH30-S but also to the
parental RH30 cells (data not shown).
Using real-time RT-PCR, we found that mRNA for LIF-R and
CXCR4 is up-regulated in RH30-L and RH30-S cells, respectively,
compared with parental RH30 cells (Fig. 5A), corresponding with
changes at the protein level as evaluated by FACS analysis (Fig. 5B).
At the same time, expression of LIF-R was down-regulated in RH30S and CXCR4 in RH30-L cells, at both the mRNA and protein levels
(Fig. 5A and B).
To investigate further the roles of LIF–LIF-R and SDF-1–CXCR4
axes in the metastasis of RH30 cells, we tested parental RH30,
RH30-L, and RH30-S cells for various properties related to their
metastatic behavior. First, we noticed in adhesion assays that
RH30-L cells show much higher spontaneous adhesion to bone
marrow–derived fibroblasts than parental RH30 and RH30-S
cells (Fig. 5C). Next, when we tested their chemotactic responsiveness to conditioned medium derived from bone marrow stroma
fibroblasts, we found that in this assay, RH30-L cells show much
lower chemotaxis to bone marrow stroma-derived conditioned
medium compared with parental RH30 and selected RH30-S cells
(Fig. 5D).
The role of the LIF–LIF-R axis in the metastasis of
rhabdomyosarcoma cells in vivo. To learn more about the role
of the LIF–LIF-R axis in the metastasis of rhabdomyosarcoma cells,
we injected RH30, RH30-L, and RH30-S cells i.v. into immunodeficient SCID-Beige inbred mice and 48 h later evaluated the seeding
of these human cells into murine bone marrow and liver. To
estimate the number of human cells that seed to bone marrow and
liver in SCID-Beige immunodeficient mice, we isolated DNA and
using real-time RT-PCR amplified human a-satellite sequences and
murine h-actin. We found that RH30-L cells showed four to five
times higher seeding efficiency into the bone marrow and liver of
immunodeficient SCID-Beige mice than parental RH30 and RH30-S
cells (Fig. 6A).
Next, RH30 or RH30-L cells (5  106 per mouse) were injected
i.m. into the hind limb. Six weeks later, we evaluated the number of
human rhabdomyosarcoma cells present in the bone marrow, lung,
and livers of animals inoculated with rhabdomyosarcoma cells. We
found a significant increase in number of rhabdomyosarcoma cells

in the bone marrow and lungs of mice injected with RH30-L cells
(Fig. 6B).
Finally, we down-regulated the expression of LIF-R in RH30
cells using the siRNA strategy (Fig. 6C, inset). Next, RH30 cells

In children and adolescents diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma,
the involvement of bone marrow is a poor prognostic sign and
represents a continuing challenge to current treatment modalities
(2, 3, 21). There is thus a need for more effective therapies, and
elucidating the mechanisms that control the metastasis of
rhabdomyosarcoma cells could be a means to achieve this.
Both the SDF-1–CXCR4 and HGF/SF–c-met axes have been
implicated in the metastasis of several solid tumors (22–31) and we
have reported that rhabdomyosarcoma cells could be chemoattracted to the bone marrow by SDF-1 and HGF (11, 14). However,
as we show here, inhibition of both axes did not completely inhibit
the chemotaxis of rhabdomyosarcoma cells to conditioned
medium harvested from bone marrow–derived fibroblasts, suggesting the involvement of other chemoattractants.
Because LIF plays a pivotal role in muscle regeneration (15–18),
we hypothesized that LIF and OSM, which activate similar
receptors, could be involved in the metastasis of rhabdomyosarcoma. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of anti-LIF-R
antibodies that were added to the cocktail of CXCR4 and c-met
inhibitors to see whether such a combination could inhibit
migration of the highly metastatic ARMS cell line RH30. We
provide the first evidence that blockade of gp190 inhibits the
chemotaxis of solid tumor cells, suggesting direct involvement of
LIF in the migration of rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The fact that LIF,
like SDF-1 or HGF, is a morphogenic factor in organogenesis
supports this observation. Furthermore, LIF may also be involved
in the chemoattraction of circulating stem cells to damaged heart
(17) or brain (32) as we recently show. Thus, LIF, initially thought to
act as a hematopoietic cytokine (18), in fact displays various
pleiotropic effects.
To elucidate in more detail the biological effects of LIF/OSM in
rhabdomyosarcoma, we selected rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines that
respond to stimulation by LIF by phosphorylation of MAPK p42/44
or STAT3 and tested whether these factors increase rhabdomyosarcoma cell proliferation. However, despite the fact that these
signal transduction pathways are involved in regulating cell
proliferation (33), we did not find that LIF had any effect on the
proliferation of rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. This is in striking
contrast to normal skeletal muscle cells where LIF has been
reported to act as a proliferative factor (33).
Next, we examined events directly related to cell metastatic/
invasive behavior, such as resistance to chemotherapy, chemotaxis,
adhesion, and production of MMPs. First, we found that LIF
increases the survival of rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines during
exposure to etoposide, a cytostatic commonly used to treat this
tumor. Thus, LIF alone, or in combination with other factors, may
stimulate the survival of metastasizing cells and make them more
resistant to chemotherapy. We reported a similar effect for HGF
(14) but not for SDF-1 (11). Because we have shown that LIF did

LIF–LIF-R Axis in Rhabdomyosarcoma

not enhance the survival of rhabdomyosarcoma cells when they are
cultured in Teflon dishes (which prevents adhesion), we postulate
that the prosurvival effect of LIF is closely related to the adhesive
status of these cells. Thus, by increasing adhesion LIF indirectly
increases the resistance of rhabdomyosarcoma cells to apoptosis.
Hence, we suggest that targeting the LIF–LIF-R axis may be of
therapeutic importance not only for controlling the metastatic
behavior of rhabdomyosarcoma cells but also for improving the
clinical outcome of chemotherapy. The molecular mechanism for
this resistance, however, requires further study and is currently
under investigation in our laboratory.
Furthermore, LIF strongly enhances adhesion of rhabdomyosarcoma cells to fibronectin, endothelial cells, and bone marrow–
derived fibroblasts and stimulates stress fiber formation and at
the molecular level colocalization of FAK and paxillin in focal
contacts and activation of small GTPase Rho. It is well known
that colocalization of FAK and paxillin in focal contacts is
crucial for cell adhesion (34–36). Interestingly, LIF, SDF-1, and
HGF did not affect expression of adhesion molecules on
rhabdomyosarcoma cells.
In our previous studies, we observed that transcripts for MMP-2
and MMP-9 as well as membrane type-1 MMP and tissue inhibitor
of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 were detectable in all the rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines tested (11, 14). Although LIF and OSM are
chemoattractants for rhabdomyosarcoma cells, in contrast to SDF1 (11) and HGF (14), we found that stimulation with LIF does not
influence expression of MMPs or TIMPs, either at the mRNA (realtime RT-PCR) or protein (zymography and reverse zymography)
levels in any of the rhabdomyosarcoma lines tested (data not
shown). Thus, the effect of LIF in metastasis is not directly linked
to modulation of the expression/secretion of MMPs.
Our previous and current data also show that metastasis of
rhabdomyosarcoma is regulated by several prometastatic axes,
such SDF-1–CXCR4, HGF-SF–c-met, and LIF–LIF-R; thus, strategies
aimed on inhibition of only one of these axes may be not sufficient
to prevent the spread of rhabdomyosarcoma cells. To compare the
role of the LIF–LIF-R axis with that of SDF-1–CXCR4 axis in
directing the metastasis of rhabdomyosarcoma cells, we obtained
(by repetitive chemotactic isolation) two different populations of
the highly metastatic RH30 cells. We observed that the RH30 cells
selected by chemotaxis to LIF significantly enhanced spontaneous
adhesion to bone marrow–derived fibroblasts in contrast to those
selected by SDF-1 and even to the parental cell line. This increased
adhesiveness corresponded with decreased motility of these cells to
medium conditioned by the bone marrow stroma. Furthermore, in
in vivo metastasis studies using LIF- and SDF-1–selected RH30

cells, the LIF-selected cells had much higher seeding efficiency to
liver and bone marrow, implying that adhesion was a crucial
component of their metastatic behavior. Similarly, mice inoculated
i.m. with RH30-L cells had more rhabdomyosarcoma cells in the
bone marrow and lung after 6 weeks compared with parental RH30 cells. The metastatic potential of RH30 cells in vivo was
inhibited by siRNA against LIF-R. It is likely that cells displaying
increased motility tend to become ‘‘homeless’’ and ultimately
undergo apoptosis, a notion, however, that requires further study.
As stated above, the alveolar type of rhabdomyosarcoma is
more metastatic than the embryonal, and in our previous work,
we hypothesized that increased expression of the CXCR4 and
c-met receptors on ARMS cells could be modulated by the PAX3FKHR fusion gene (12, 13, 37). In fact, the CXCR4 and c-met
promoter contain several PAX binding sites and it has been
reported that PAX3 modulates expression of the c-met receptor
during limb development (37). Moreover, microarray analysis
identified c-met as a PAX3 downstream target gene (12). In this
study, we did not find a correlation between rhabdomyosarcoma type and LIF-R expression. Overexpression of the PAX3FKHR fusion gene in the ERMS cell lines led to up-regulation
of CXCR4 (11) and c-met (14) but did not affect expression of
LIF-R. This suggests that LIF-R, in contrast to CXCR4 (11) and
c-met (14), is not regulated by the PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR
fusion genes. It also does not correlate with rhabdomyosarcoma
type.
In conclusion, we present evidence for the first time that the
LIF–LIF-R axis may direct metastasis and enhance the invasive
potential of solid tumors (rhabdomyosarcoma). Hence, molecular
targeting of LIF or LIF-R (e.g., as we show here using the siRNA
strategy) has potential as a new antimetastatic strategy to improve
therapeutic outcome for patients suffering from sarcomas.
Molecular strategies aimed at inhibiting the LIF–LIF-R axis and
the SDF-1–CXCR4 axis, for example, by the use of small-molecule
inhibitors, could lead to the development of new antimetastatic
therapies that could complement conventional radiotherapy or
chemotherapy in preventing the dissemination of rhabdomyosarcoma cells into the bone marrow and lymph nodes.
