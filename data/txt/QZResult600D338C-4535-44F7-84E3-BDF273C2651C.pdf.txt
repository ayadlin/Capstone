Abstract
Non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) that have developed
resistance to EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI), including geﬁtinib and erlotinib, are clinically linked to
an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype.
Here, we examined whether modulating EMT maintains the
responsiveness of EGFR-mutated NSCLCs to EGFR TKI therapy. Using human NSCLC cell lines harboring mutated EGFR
and a transgenic mouse model of lung cancer driven by mutant
EGFR (EGFR-Del19-T790M), we demonstrate that EGFR inhibition induces TGFb secretion followed by SMAD pathway
activation, an event that promotes EMT. Chronic exposure of
EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells to TGFb was sufﬁcient to induce
EMT and resistance to EGFR TKI treatment. Furthermore,
NSCLC HCC4006 cells with acquired resistance to geﬁtinib
were characterized by a mesenchymal phenotype and dis-

played a higher prevalence of the EGFR T790M mutated allele.
Notably, combined inhibition of EGFR and the TGFb receptor
in HCC4006 cells prevented EMT but was not sufﬁcient to
prevent acquired geﬁtinib resistance because of an increased
emergence of the EGFR T790M allele compared with cells
treated with geﬁtinib alone. Conversely, another independent
NSCLC cell line, PC9, reproducibly developed EGFR T790M
mutations as the primary mechanism underlying EGFR TKI
resistance, even though the prevalence of the mutant allele was
lower than that in HCC4006 cells. Thus, our ﬁndings underscore heterogeneity within NSCLC cells lines harboring EGFR
kinase domain mutations that give rise to divergent resistance
mechanisms in response to treatment and anticipate the complexity of EMT suppression as a therapeutic strategy. Cancer Res;

Activating EGF receptor (EGFR) mutations dictate responsiveness of non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) to reversible EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including geﬁtinib and erlotinib
(1–4). Despite promising initial responses, acquired resistance
universally develops, mediated by the emergence of the secondary
T790M mutation or by focal ampliﬁcation of MET, in approximately 60% and 5% of patients, respectively (5–10).
NSCLCs with acquired EGFR TKI resistance that present with an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype have
been identiﬁed in recent clinical studies (9, 11–13). Similarly,
NSCLC cells with EGFR TKI sensitizing mutations may develop an
EMT phenotype upon chronic exposure to erlotinib (14–16). EMT
is a cellular program observed in normal development and is
implicated in tumor progression and metastasis (17). Overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL has been associated
with the EMT gene signature in NSCLC and confers acquired
erlotinib resistance in cell line models (15, 16). AXL has therefore
been proposed as a therapeutic target in EGFR TKI–resistant
NSCLC cell lines with EMT phenotype. However, in other studies,
AXL inhibition has not sensitized resistant cells with EMT phenotype to EGFR TKIs (18). These conﬂicting results suggest that

Heterogeneity in Tumors and Resistance to EGFR TKI Therapy

developing targeted therapies for NSCLCs that have acquired
EGFR TKI resistance via EMT could potentially be difﬁcult and
that a more complete understanding of the mechanisms by which
the inhibition of mutant EGFR in NSCLC cells promotes EMT is
required.
The study of resistance to EGFR TKIs in EGFR-mutated NSCLC
is complex because tumor heterogeneity may promote different
mechanisms of resistance at different metastatic sites (18). For
example, EGFR TKI resistance with MET ampliﬁcation may occur
with or without a T790M mutation, and the occurrence varies
among postmortem samples obtained from metastatic sites from
the same patient (19, 20). In this regard, it is important to
preclinically investigate whether EGFR-mutated NSCLC can
remain sensitive to EGFR TKIs by successfully suppressing EMT
or whether the acquisition of divergent resistance mechanisms
will limit the use of this strategy.
To elucidate the mechanisms promoting EMT in NSCLCs
harboring mutated EGFR, we have performed analyses using
multiplex growth factor and cytokine assays and genomic signatures of NSCLC cells in which acquired EGFR TKI resistance is
associated with the EMT phenotype. We have also evaluated the
ability of combined EGFR inhibition and EMT suppression to
prevent acquired resistance and have investigated the signiﬁcance
of tumor heterogeneity in NSCLC in the emergence of EGFR TKI
acquired resistance.

Materials and Methods
NSCLC cell lines and STR assays
HCC827, HCC4006, and NCI-H1975 NSCLC cells were
obtained from the ATCC and were maintained as speciﬁed. The
cell lines were tested by certiﬁed third-party laboratories for
authenticity (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Materials and Methods).
Details for the STR assay are described in the Supplementary
Methods. gDNA from PC9 was used extensively in previous
studies and its authenticity has been conﬁrmed (21, 22).
Generation of EGFR TKI or geﬁtinib/SB431542-resistant cells
To generate cell lines resistant to ﬁrst-generation EGFR TKIs,
HCC4006 or HCC827 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of geﬁtinib or erlotinib over 6 months in a manner similar
to previously described (22–24); however, resulting resistant cell
lines for HCC4006 cells are polyclonal and not clones. Geﬁtinib/
SB431542-resistant HCC4006 cells were developed in a similar
manner, with continuous exposure to 1 mmol/L SB431542. For
HCC827 erlotinib–resistant cells, clones were isolated. All resistant cells are able to proliferate normally in the presence of 10
mmol/L geﬁtinib. Cell viability was used to conﬁrm geﬁtinib
resistance after allowing the cells to grow geﬁtinib-free for 7 days.
Upon conﬁrming resistance, cells were cultured without drugs
and their resistance to geﬁtinib was examined periodically.
Generation of EGFR TKI–resistant cells by TGFb1 exposure
HCC827 and HCC4006 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with FBS and 10 ng/mL of human recombinant TGFb1
(Life). Cells were seeded at 70% conﬂuence in 60-mm dishes and
the media were replaced every other day until cells started proliferating normally (28–30 days).
Cell viability assays and cell counting
NSCLC cells were cultured in the presence of drugs or vehicle for
72 hours, and viability was determined using the Cell Counting

www.aacrjournals.org

Kit-8 (CCK-8) colorimetric assay (Dojindo) as previously
described (25). The results were analyzed and displayed using
Prism 6 (GraphPad Software). Equal amounts of cells were seeded
in the assays to compare cell growth kinetics. Live cells were
counted using Countess (Life). Details are provided in the Supplementary Methods.
Western blot analysis
Lysate preparation and Western blotting were performed as
described previously (26). A list of antibodies used is available in
the Supplementary Methods.
Luminex assay
Details for Luminex-based multibead assays are available in the
Supplementary Methods.
shRNA constructs and lentiviral infection
pLKO.1 shRNA constructs designed by The RNAi Consortium
were used as described previously (26). shRNA sequences and
procedures are provided in the Supplementary Methods.
RNA and DNA extraction
RNA from cell lines was extracted and puriﬁed using QIAshredder and RNeasy Plus (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and
Tissue Kit (Qiagen). DNA and RNA samples were quantiﬁed using
NanoDrop ND-2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientiﬁc) followed by Qubit (Life).
DNA sequencing
EGFR exons 19 and 20 were ampliﬁed from DNA from cell lines
using primers described previously (27). Resulting PCR products
were puriﬁed and subjected to Sanger sequencing (Genewiz).
Primer sequences and conditions are available in the Supplementary Methods.
Detection of EGFR T790M with ddPCR
Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was performed at the Belfer
Institute, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA), as previously described (28).
Analysis of microarray gene expression data
Gene expression proﬁling methods are available in the Supplementary Methods.
Detection of apoptosis by ﬂow cytometry
Adherent cells were removed from plates using Accutase
(Life) and pooled. Apoptosis was assessed using an Annexin
V-FLUOS Staining Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Murine drug treatment studies
Human EGFR exon 19 deletion/T790M (TD)-inducible bitransgenic mice were generated and have been previously characterized
(24). After continuous exposure to doxycycline diets for more
than 8 weeks, bitransgenic mice were subjected to MRI to document the lung tumor burden. After initial imaging, mice were
treated either with vehicle (10% 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone:90%
PEG-300) alone or WZ4002, the mutant-selective EGFR TKI with
activity against T790M, at 25 mg/kg gavage daily.

Histology and immunohistochemistry
After sacriﬁce, the left lung of each mouse was dissected and
snap-frozen for biochemical analysis. The right lung was inﬂated
with buffered 10% formalin for 10 minutes and ﬁxed in 10%
formalin overnight at room temperature. The specimen was
washed once in PBS, placed in 70% ethanol, and embedded in
parafﬁn, from which 5-mm sections were generated. IHC was
performed in the Department of Pathology at Brigham and
Women's Hospital (Boston, MA). A list of antibodies used is
available in the Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise stated, comparisons of statistical signiﬁcance
were performed using the Student t test. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Chronic exposure of EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells to increasing
concentrations of geﬁtinib promotes acquired EGFR TKI
resistance with a mesenchymal phenotype
We ﬁrst generated a mass culture of HCC4006 cells that were
resistant to geﬁtinib (HCC4006Ge-R) by growing cells in increasing concentrations of geﬁtinib to a ﬁnal concentration of 10

4374 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

mmol/L for up to 6 months in vitro (Fig. 1A). Cell viability and
Annexin V apoptosis assays conﬁrmed that HCC4006Ge-R cells
(Ge-R) are highly resistant to geﬁtinib and afatinib compared with
the parental HCC4006 cells (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S1A).
RTK proﬁling revealed that EGFR, MET, HER2, and HER3 are
tyrosine-phosphorylated in Ge-R cells cultured without geﬁtinib.
Prolonged exposure of Ge-R cells to geﬁtinib suppressed RTK
phosphorylation, except for residual phosphorylation of EGFR
and AXL (Fig. 1C). However, the treatment of Ge-R cells with the
combination of geﬁtinib and the AXL inhibitor R428 failed to
decrease the viability of Ge-R cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The
levels of EGFR and MET expression are comparable in HCC4006
and Ge-R cells (Fig. 1D). The morphology of Ge-R cells is
characteristic of that observed in mesenchymal cells. Western
blotting using antibodies against canonical epithelial and mesenchymal markers revealed that Ge-R cells underwent EMT (Fig.
1E). Similarly, NCI-H1975 (H1975) cells harboring L858R/
T790M grown resistant to the irreversible EGFR TKI, CL387,785 (Supplementary Fig. S1C) also demonstrated a mesenchymal phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
In contrast, chronic EGFR inhibition in HCC827 cells predominantly resulted in erlotinib-resistant cells with MET ampliﬁcation. Subcloning was required to isolate erlotinib-resistant

Heterogeneity in Tumors and Resistance to EGFR TKI Therapy

HCC827 cells demonstrating a mesenchymal phenotype without
evidence of MET ampliﬁcation (Fig. 1F). The mesenchymal clone
(ERC4) was resistant to combined EGFR and MET inhibition (Fig.
1G). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that
ERC4 cells are mesenchymal with signiﬁcant gene set enrichment
for a geﬁtinib resistance signature (Supplementary Fig. S1E).
In summary, the mass culture of HCC4006 or H1975 cells
grown resistant to reversible and irreversible EGFR TKIs, respectively, were mesenchymal, whereas subcloning was necessary to
isolate erlotinib-resistant HCC827 cells that are mesenchymal.
These experiments demonstrate that the probability of EMT
emerging as a mechanism of EGFR TKI resistance varies among
EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell lines.
TGFb1 promotes EMT and EGFR TKI resistance that is
reversible
Using Luminex-based multiplex assays, we proﬁled growth
factors and cytokines in the supernatants from erlotinib-resistant
HCC827 cell clones (Fig. 2A). In the mesenchymal ERC4 clone,
TGFb1 was the most abundant growth factor secreted, whereas it
was less abundant in MET-ampliﬁed clones. In 2 of 3 METampliﬁed clones, increased HGF secretion was observed, suggesting the presence of a MET–HGF autocrine loop, as previously
reported (8). The amount of TGFb1 secreted from HCC4006Ge-R
cells was also signiﬁcantly greater than that from parental
HCC4006 cells (Fig. 2B, P ¼ 0.0084). On the basis of the results,
we hypothesized that TGFb1-mediated mesenchymal transition
makes mutant EGFR NSCLC cells resistant to EGFR TKIs. To test
the hypothesis, we chronically exposed HCC827 cells to 10 ng/mL
of TGFb1 for 30 days. This promoted a mesenchymal phenotype.
In addition, removal of TGFb1 from the cell culture media for
more than 30 days partially restored an epithelial phenotype (Fig.
2C). HCC827 cells were resistant to EGFR TKIs in the TGFb1induced mesenchymal state, and the removal of TGFb1 restored
sensitivity (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly, TGFb1-mediated mesenchymal
transition was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in ERBB
family receptor expression (Fig. 2E), even though the cells were
able to proliferate normally. Similarly, exposure of HCC4006 cells
to TGFb1 also promoted mesenchymal transition and EGFR TKI
resistance, which was reversible upon removal of TGFb1 from the
media (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Erlotinib treatment of HCC827 cells results in dephosphorylation of AKT and ERK and induction of the proapoptotic protein
BIM, as shown previously (29). In contrast, erlotinib treatment of
HCC827 TGFb1 cells failed to suppress phosphorylation of EGFR,
AKT, and ERK or to induce BIM (Fig. 2F). Similarly, treatment of
HCC4006 cells with 10 ng/mL of TGFb1 for 30 days promoted a
mesenchymal phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and a 100fold increase in resistance to geﬁtinib when compared with
parental HCC4006 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These results
demonstrate that continued exposure to TGFb1 is necessary to
maintain the mesenchymal phenotype and EGFR TKI–resistant
state.
Chronic EGFR inhibition promotes secretion of TGFb1 and
subsequent activation of the SMAD pathway
We next investigated whether chronic EGFR inhibition was
sufﬁcient to promote continuous TGFb1 secretion. Supernatants
from HCC4006 cells treated with 100 nmol/L geﬁtinib were
collected at 24, 48, and 72 hours. TGFb1 concentration in the
cell-free supernatants was measured by Luminex-based assay and

www.aacrjournals.org

normalized using the number of live cells attached to the plate at
the time of harvest. TGFb1 secreted by the surviving cells significantly increased over time (Fig. 3A). Similarly, TGFb1 secretion
from HCC827 cells was profoundly increased upon EGFR TKI
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Equimolar erlotinib and
geﬁtinib equally promoted TGFb1 secretion from HCC827 or
HCC4006 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). In contrast, EGFR wildtype NCI-H1734 cells did not demonstrate a statistically significant increase in TGFb1 secretion after EGFR TKI exposure.
To test whether the secreted TGFb1 is biologically active and
able to stimulate TGFb receptors expressed on HCC827 cells, the
phosphorylation status of TGFb receptor downstream proteins,
SMAD2 and SMAD3, was monitored using the multiplex Luminex
assay. Increased phosphorylation of SMAD2 (S465/467) and
SMAD3 (S423/425) correlated with the increased secretion of
TGFb, and the phosphorylation was signiﬁcantly downregulated
in the presence of the TGFb receptor inhibitor SB431542 (Fig. 3B).
Western blotting conﬁrmed that HCC4006 cells treated with
erlotinib show increased SMAD2 (S465/467) phosphorylation,
despite a decrease in total SMAD2 protein expression and that
phosphorylation was diminished in the presence of SB431542
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). Consistent with the insigniﬁcant
increase of TGFb secretion in EGFR wild-type (WT) cells, erlotinib
treatment of NCI-H1734 cells failed to induce phosphorylation of
SMAD2 and SMAD3 (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
To extend our ﬁndings to in vivo, we assessed whether similar
events occurred in mouse lung cancers driven by human EGFR
exon19 deletion/T790M (TD) that respond to the EGFR mutant–
speciﬁc irreversible TKI WZ4002 to promote tumor regression
(24). Treatment of the mouse tumors with WZ4002 for 2 days
suppressed EGFR activity and activated SMAD2/3 activities, recapitulating our ﬁnding in cell lines (Fig. 3C).
To eliminate the possibility that off-target effects of erlotinib are
responsible for the induction of TGFb1 secretion, we used targetspeciﬁc shRNA-mediated depletion of EGFR in HCC827 cells.
Upon puromycin selection, clones with MET overexpression or
EMT were isolated (Supplementary Fig. S3E) similar to clones
isolated in the erlotinib-resistant population (Fig. 1F). Slight MET
ampliﬁcation was observed in clone 10 but not in clone 9
(Supplementary Fig. S3F). Clone 9 was resistant to geﬁtinib (Fig.
3E) without apparent upregulation of RTKs (Supplementary Fig.
S3G). GSEA revealed signiﬁcant enrichment of mesenchymal and
geﬁtinib-resistant gene signatures in this clone (Fig. 3F) and
demonstrated a marked increase in TGFb1 secretion (Fig. 3G,
P ¼ 0.0011) albeit after prolonged EGFR knockdown.
Concurrent EGFR and TGFbR inhibition prevents
mesenchymal transition but does not avert emergence of EGFR
TKI resistance
We next investigated whether cotreatment with an EGFR inhibitor and a TGFb receptor inhibitor is effective in preventing the
emergence of EMT-mediated EGFR TKI resistance in these cells.
HCC4006 cells were grown in the presence of geﬁtinib or geﬁtinib
and SB431542 for 6 months (Fig. 4A) until they demonstrated
normal growth kinetics in the presence of increasing inhibitor
concentrations. Lysates from cells cultured more than 3 months in
the presence of drugs were subjected to Western blotting with the
indicated antibodies (Fig. 4B). HCC4006 cells continuously treated with geﬁtinib alone exhibited reduced expression of the
epithelial marker E-cadherin and an increased level of the mesenchymal marker vimentin (Fig. 4B). In HCC4006 cells cotreated

HCC4006 cells cotreated with geﬁtinib and SB431592 toward the
end of the treatment (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, culturing HCC827
cells in increasing concentrations of geﬁtinib resulted in the initial
depletion of E-cadherin and increase of N-cadherin and vimentin
over the ﬁrst 24 days (Supplementary Fig. S4A); however, longterm (6 month) incubation predominantly gave rise to geﬁtinibresistant cells with MET ampliﬁcation (data not shown).
GeSB-R cells harbor T790M mutation and remain modestly
sensitive to AZD9291
At the end of 6-month treatment, HCC4006 cells proliferate
normally in the presence of 10 mmol/L geﬁtinib (Ge-R) with a
mesenchymal phenotype or in the presence of 10 mmol/L geﬁtinib
and 1 mmol/L SB431542 (GeSB-R) with an epithelial phenotype
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). Because geﬁtinib failed to inhibit EGFR

www.aacrjournals.org

in GeSB-R, we challenged the resulting cells with the irreversible
EGFR inhibitor, afatinib (Fig. 4C). While geﬁtinib failed to
inhibit EGFR in GeSB-R cells, afatinib dephosphorylated EGFR
in GeSB-R. Despite the complete inhibition of EGFR by geﬁtinib
and afatinib in GeR cells, downstream AKT and ERK phosphorylation persisted, suggesting the presence of a bypass pathway to
activate downstream signaling (Fig. 4D). In GeSB-R cells, afatinib
but not geﬁtinib reduced AKT and ERK phosphorylation. GeR cells
were resistant to both geﬁtinib and afatinib, whereas GeSB-R
remained fairly sensitive to afatinib. Afatinib treatment induced a
small degree of apoptosis in GeSB-R cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
We extracted DNA from HCC4006, Ge-R, and GeSB-R cells and
performed sequencing of EGFR. Sanger sequencing demonstrated
that both Ge-R and GeSB-R cells preserved c.2239_3348delinsC

mutation in exon 20 of the EGFR gene was only detected in GeSBR cells (Fig. 5A). DNA samples were next subjected to ddPCR
assays that have been used to detect rare mutations (30). The
prevalence of EGFR T790M mutation detected was highest in
GeSB-R cells (18.3%) and was signiﬁcantly lower in Ge-R cells
(1.2%; Fig. 5B).
AZD9291 is a potent and selective third-generation EGFR
irreversible inhibitor that has been shown to potently inhibit
EGFR with T790M (31, 32). On the basis of sequencing and
ddPCR results, we challenged HCC4006, Ge-R, and GeSB-R cells
with DMSO or 500 nmol/L of AZD9291 for 2 hours (Supplementary Fig. S5A). AZD9291 depleted EGFR phosphorylation in
HCC4006, Ge-R, and GeSB-R cells; however, complete dephosphorylation of downstream secondary signaling molecules, AKT,
ERK, and S6, was only evident in HCC4006 cells. Residual AKT,
ERK, and S6 phosphorylation was evident in GeSB-R cells treated
with AZD9291. Consistent with the phosphorylation status of
AKT, ERK, and S6 phosphorylation in parental, Ge-R, and GeSB-R
HCC4006 cells, parental cells were most sensitive and Ge-R cells
were most resistant to AZD9291 (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Preexisting T790M mutation is more abundant in HCC4006
cells than in PC9 cells
Previous reports suggested that the T790M mutation pre-exists
in cis with a primary EGFR-activating mutation in a small population and is positively selected upon EGFR TKI treatment
(22, 23, 33). PC9 cells are well characterized to reproducibly
develop EGFR TKI resistance via the emergence of T790M (18, 34).

HCC4006 and HCC4006 grown
resistant to geﬁtinib (HCC4006Ge-R)
and to geﬁtinib in the presence of
SB431542 (HCC4006GeSB-R) were
treated with DMSO (D), 500 nmol/L
geﬁtinib (ge), or 500 nmol/L afatinib
(af) for 24 hours. Lysates were made
and subjected to Western blotting
with antibodies indicated. D, same
lysates prepared in C were subjected
to immunoblots showing signaling
molecules downstream of EGFR.

In contrast, the prevalence of T790M in geﬁtinib-resistant
HCC4006 cells (Ge-R) was fairly low (1.2%), and the impact of
T790M in geﬁtinib resistance was not evident unless HCC4006
cells were cotreated with geﬁtinib and SB431542 (GeSB-R).
Consequently, we tried to estimate the prevalence of preexisting
cell population with T790M both in PC9 and in HCC4006. We
performed ddPCR using a high number of replicates [250000
Genome Equivalent (GE) in 48 wells] to evaluate the relative
frequency of T790M allele compared with wild-type T790 allele
(Fig. 6A). We were able to identify the presence of T790M allele in
both the parental cell lines investigated with a frequency of
0.0738% in HCC4006 cells and of 0.0360% in PC9 cells.
To verify that Ge-R and GeSB-R were derived from parental
HCC4006 cells, we performed 16 point STR cell authentication on
parental HCC4006, HCC4006Ge-R with a mesenchymal phenotype, and HCC4006GeSB-R cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
D16S539 STR on chromosome 11 was missing in
HCC4006Ge-R cells, whereas HCC4006GeSB-R cells maintain
D16S539 STR on chromosomes 11 and 12. D3S1358 STR on
chromosome 18 was missing in HCC4006GeSB-R cells, whereas
HCC4006GeR cells carry D3S1358 STR on chromosomes 16 and
18. Interestingly, Ge-R and GeSB-R cells differ by 2 STRs, but the
combined STR proﬁle of the 2 resistant cell populations perfectly
matches the STR proﬁle of HCC4006 cells. This result suggests that
the parental HCC4006 cell line is heterogeneous and minimally
contains 2 discrete subpopulations of cells with different STR
proﬁles. Each of the 2 subpopulations was selected in response to
a different selection pressure.

cells by 16 points STR demonstrates that different subpopulations of HCC4006 cells were selected by the different treatments.

Discussion
Several groups have reported histologic changes in NSCLC
specimens obtained from tumors with acquired EGFR TKI resistance that are consistent with EMT (9, 12, 13). However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying EMT and their impact on the
etiology of EGFR TKI resistance have not been fully elucidated.
Using EGFR TKIs and shRNA targeting EGFR, we have shown
that EGFR inhibition or depletion promotes TGFb1 secretion
from both the EGFR-mutant HCC827 and HCC4006 cell lines
(Fig. 3A and G). However, it remains unclear how EGFR inhibition results in TGFb secretion in EGFR-mutated cells. It has been
reported that erlotinib- resistant PC9 cells promote TGFb2 secretion with enhanced motility, although the resistant cells do not
exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype (35). It is possible that the
TGFb species secreted following EGFR inhibition is cell lineage–
speciﬁc. Nonetheless, in HCC827 and HCC4006 cells, the
increase in TGFb1 secretion correlated with the activation of
downstream SMAD targets in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3B and C),
and the presence of TGFb receptor inhibitor, SB431542, attenuated SMAD activation in vitro. Of note, erlotinib treatment of NCI-

www.aacrjournals.org

H1734 cells harboring wild-type EGFR did not promote significant TGFb1 secretion (Supplementary Fig. S3A) or SMAD activation (Supplementary Fig. S3D). These results suggest that
inhibition of mutated-EGFR establishes the autocrine TGFb1
pathway loop to positively stimulate the SMAD pathway in
EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
Several studies have demonstrated that exposing EGFR-mutant
NSCLC cells to TGFb1 induces EMT associated with EGFR TKI
resistance (14, 36, 37). However, it is unclear whether the EGFR
TKI resistance was due to cytostatic effects mediated by TGFb1, as
slow-growing tumors are inherently resistant to therapies (38).
We have cultured EGFR-mutant HCC827 and HCC4006 cells in
the presence of 10 ng/mL TGFb1 until they achieved a mesenchymal state and proliferated at the same rate as parental cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2D). The mesenchymal cells are resistant to
EGFR TKIs and lose expression of ERBB receptors while they
maintain downstream pathways critical for proliferation and
survival (Fig. 2F). Despite the phosphorylation of EGFR and AXL
that was demonstrated on RTK arrays, mesenchymal Ge-R cells
did not appear to depend on major RTK oncogenic drivers for
growth and survival, as concurrent EGFR and AXL inhibition

failed to kill the resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). These
results strongly suggest the presence of novel oncogenic drivers in
EGFR TKI–resistant NSCLC with EMT.
TGFb1-induced mesenchymal transition and EGFR TKI resistance in HCC827 and HCC4006 cells were reversible upon TGFb1
withdrawal (Fig. 2C and D). Chronic exposure of EGFR-mutant
NSCLC to EGFR inhibitors underlies the establishment of a
continuous TGFb1 autocrine loop and subsequent EMT-mediated
EGFR TKI resistance. Taken together, our results suggest that
sustained TGFb secretion following chronic EGFR inhibition
provides a suitable environment for EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells
to undergo EMT. It is noteworthy that patients with NSCLC who
progressed on an EGFR TKI therapy responded to the treatment
after a "drug holiday" (39, 40); however, it remains unclear how
the discontinuation of the therapy resensitizes the EGFR-mutant
NSCLC to EGFR inhibition. Our experimental results suggest that
relieving EGFR inhibition could deplete TGFb1 to reverse EMT,
which in turn might resensitize tumors to EGFR TKIs, thus
prolonging the duration of EGFR TKI therapy. However, the fact
that the mesenchymal phenotype and TKI resistance in HCC827
(ERC4) and HCC4006Ge-R is irreversible after TGFb receptor

4380 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

inhibition suggests that approaches to reverse EMT may only be
plausible as a preventive strategy.
In HCC4006 cells, combined EGFR and TGFb inhibition successfully prevented geﬁtinib-induced EMT; however, the resulting
cells still became resistant to geﬁtinib, and the population was
enriched with cells that harbor EGFR secondary T790M mutation
(18.3%, Fig. 5B). To date, EGFR TKI resistance via emergence of a
T790M secondary mutation has not been reported in HCC4006
cells. Of note, the irreversible EGFR TKI, AZD9291, dephosphorylated EGFR in GeSB-R cells; however, complete dephosphorylation of downstream secondary signaling molecules, AKT, ERK,
and S6, was only evident in parental HCC4006 cells, not in GeSBR (Supplementary Fig. S5A). This result suggests the presence of a
heterogeneous population in GeSB-R cells and also suggests that
the use of third-generation mutant-selective EGFR TKIs that
inhibit T790M might be attenuated in cells composed of a
heterogeneous population.
Whether the resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs evolve under
the selective pressure of the drugs or preexist prior to treatment is
the subject of ongoing investigation. Here, we performed ddPCRbased T790M detection in HCC4006 cells and in PC9 cells and

Heterogeneity in Tumors and Resistance to EGFR TKI Therapy

found a small subpopulation of the cells harboring T790M
mutant allele in both cell lines with frequencies of 0.0738% and
0.0360%, respectively (Fig. 6B). Despite the low frequency of
T790M alleles in parental PC9 cells, PC9 cells reproducibly
develop resistance to reversible EGFR TKIs with T790M secondary
mutation (34, 41). In contrast, HCC4006 cells, with a slightly
greater frequency of T790M alleles, reproducibly develop TKI
resistance with a mesenchymal phenotype. This ﬁnding suggests
that the prevalence of T790M alleles in parental cells does not
necessarily predict the emergence of EGFR TKI resistance with
T790M. The fact that the frequency of T790M alleles in
HCC4006Ge-R (Fig. 5B, 1.2%) was much lower than the frequency in HCC4006GeSB-R suggests that heterogeneous tumors inherently possess the potential to give rise to EGFR TKI–resistant cells
with different resistance mechanisms depending on the treatment
(Fig. 6C). Our results from STR analysis also support the notion
that the cells with a discrete genetic makeup are selected by a
particular treatment regimen from the heterogeneous cell population. Taken together, our results highlight the difﬁculty in
interpreting results from functional assays that use human NSCLC
cell lines harboring EGFR mutation, as we need to account for
tumor heterogeneity within the cell population.
This view is further supported by our original observation that
the abundance of TGFb1 in the growth media following EGFR
inhibition does not preferentially select for the emergence of EMTassociated EGFR TKI resistance. Despite the fact that prolonged
EGFR inhibition in HCC827 cells provides a favorable environment for the cells to undergo EMT with an increase in TGFb1
concentration, the cells predominantly develop EGFR TKI resistance through MET ampliﬁcation. Only a limited subpopulation
of the clones develops EMT-mediated EGFR TKI resistance (Fig.
1F). In contrast, HCC4006 cells reproducibly develop EMT-associated EGFR TKI resistance (Fig. 1B; ref. 14).
In HCC4006 cells concurrently treated with geﬁtinib and
SB431542, the mesenchymal marker vimentin initially increased
and then decreased (Fig. 4B). This phenomenon could be
explained by heterogeneity in HCC4006 cells. HCC4006 cells
have a propensity to develop EGFR TKI resistance with EMT
(14, 36, 42, 43); thus, the cells with mesenchymal phenotype
and high vimentin initially remain in the culture. However, the
presence of SB431542 does not allow other epithelial cells to
engage in mesenchymal transition. As a result, a subset of
HCC4006 cells harboring EGFR secondary T790M with an epithelial phenotype eventually dominate in the culture.
While we have demonstrated that TGFb1-induced mesenchymal transition and EGFR TKI resistance in EGFR-mutated NSCLC
cells are reversible, mesenchymal transition and EGFR TKI resistance in HCC4006GeR and HCC827 ERC4 cells were not reversible with chronic exposure to SB431542 (data not shown). These
results suggest that either EGFR TKI–resistant subpopulations
with a mesenchymal phenotype preexist in the parental population or that 6 months of EGFR TKI treatment results in irreversible
changes in EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells. These points will require
further clariﬁcation. Moreover, oncogenic drivers in EGFR TKI
resistant cells with a mesenchymal phenotype must be discovered
to formulate a strategy to overcome the resistance.
In conclusion, we found that an increase in TGFb concentration
induced by the inhibition of mutant EGFR is complicit in the
development of EGFR TKI resistance associated with EMT. Our
results suggest that the combination of TGFb and EGFR targeted
therapies is efﬁcacious in preventing the emergence of EMT-

associated EGFR TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells.
However, combination treatment did not prevent the emergence
of EGFR TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant HCC4006 cells but rather
provided a suitable environment for the rare subset of cells
harboring T790M mutation to emerge. Despite the presence of
the T790M subpopulation, HCC4006 cells reproducibly develop
resistance to reversible EGFR TKIs by undergoing EMT. This
ﬁnding suggests that the detection of T790M in primary tumors
prior to reversible EGFR TKI treatment may not necessarily predict
the emergence of acquired resistance with secondary EGFR T790M
mutation. Our current ﬁndings also provide insight into how
selection pressure by drug treatments underlies the etiology of
EGFR TKI resistance grown out of heterogeneous EGFR-mutant
NSCLC cell populations.
