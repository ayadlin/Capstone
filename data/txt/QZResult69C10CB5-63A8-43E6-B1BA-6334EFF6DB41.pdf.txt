Abstract
Author Manuscript

Germ-line variants in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of cancer genes disrupting microRNA
(miRNA) regulation have recently been associated with cancer risk. A variant in the 3′UTR of the
KRAS oncogene, referred to as the KRAS-variant, is associated with both cancer risk and altered
tumor biology. Here we test the hypothesis that the KRAS-variant can act as a biomarker of
outcome in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and investigate the cause of altered outcome in
KRAS-variant positive EOC patients. As this variant appears to be associated with tumor biology,
we additionally test the hypothesis that this variant can be directly targeted to impact cell survival.

Author Manuscript

EOC patients with complete clinical data were genotyped for the KRAS-variant and analyzed for
outcome (n=536), response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=125), and platinum resistance
(n=306). Outcome was separately analyzed for women with known BRCA mutations (n=79).
Gene expression was analyzed on a subset of tumors with available tissue. Cell lines were
employed to confirm altered sensitivity to chemotherapy with the KRAS-variant. The KRASvariant was directly targeted through siRNA/miRNA oligonucleotides in cell lines and survival
was measured.
Post-menopausal EOC patients with the KRAS-variant were significantly more likely to die of
ovarian cancer by multivariate analysis (HR=1.67, 95% CI=1.09–2.57, p=0.019, n=279). Possibly
explaining this finding, EOC patients with the KRAS-variant were significantly more likely to be
platinum resistant (OR=3.18, CI=1.31–7.72, p=0.0106, n=291). Additionally, direct targeting of
the KRAS-variant led to a significant reduction in EOC cell growth and survival in vitro.

Author Manuscript

These findings confirm the importance of the KRAS-variant in EOC, and indicate that the KRASvariant is a biomarker of poor outcome in EOC likely due to platinum resistance. In addition, this
work supports the hypothesis that these tumors have continued dependence on such 3′UTR
lesions, and that direct targeting may be a viable future treatment approach.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the second most common female pelvic reproductive
organ cancer in the United States, and carries the highest mortality in this category in the
Western world. It is the fifth overall leading cause of cancer death in females in the United
States, with 13,850 women dying from this disease yearly1. Despite multiple new
approaches to treatment, the high rates of death from EOC have remained largely unchanged
for many years, with a 5-year overall survival of only 30% to 39%2.
The standard chemotherapy regimen to treat EOC currently used is carboplatin and
paclitaxel3, based on prospective randomized trials4–6. While some patients are found
ultimately to be resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy (referred to as “platinum
resistant”), developing recurrence within 6 months of treatment, it is initially given to all
EOC patients. An improved understanding of the fundamental biological differences in EOC

tumors that could explain platinum resistance amongst EOC patients would allow a more
rational selection of treatments2,3,4.
miRNAs are a class of 22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that are aberrantly expressed in
virtually all cancer types, where they can function as a novel class of oncogenes or tumor
suppressors5. In EOC, in addition to distinguishing normal ovarian tissue from malignant
ovarian tissue6,7, miRNA expression patterns have been shown to be important in EOC
pathogenesis8,9, and are associated with altered EOC patient outcome10 and response to
treatment11. MiRNA expression differences have also been associated with chemotherapy
and platinum resistance in EOC10,13.

Author Manuscript

Additional insight into the importance of miRNAs in cancer has come from the discovery of
inherited single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that disrupt miRNA coding sequences12
and miRNA binding sites in the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTR) of oncogenes12,13. An
example of such a functional variant is rs61764370, referred to as the KRAS-variant, which
is located in the KRAS 3′UTR in a let-7 miRNA complementary site (LCS). This variant has
been reported to be a genetic marker of risk for lung cancer12, ovarian cancer (especially for
women from hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) families14) and triple negative
breast cancer15. In addition, this variant may have an association with BRCA1, being
enriched in both ovarian cancer patients from BRCA1 HBOC families14 and breast cancer
patients who carry pathogenic BRCA1 mutations16. The KRAS-variant has also been shown
to be associated with altered miRNA and gene expression in tumors12,17, to act as a
biomarker of poor outcome in head and neck cancer17 and to be a biomarker of resistance to
targeted chemotherapy in colon cancer18. These findings suggest a continued functional role
of the KRAS-variant in tumors, and an association with aggressive tumor biology and poor
cancer specific outcome.

Author Manuscript

Here, we evaluate the potential of the KRAS-variant to act as a biomarker of outcome in
EOC in both the presence and absence of deleterious BRCA mutations. We also investigate
the potential cause of altered outcome in KRAS-variant EOC patients by studying the
response to neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy, assessing platinum resistance, and
evaluating EOC tumor gene expression. Finally, we test the hypothesis that directly
targeting this gain-of-function KRAS-variant could reduce cell growth and survival in EOC
cell lines with this lesion.

Results
Overall survival in EOC patients with the KRAS-variant

Author Manuscript

We evaluated the association of the KRAS-variant with overall survival in 454 EOC patients
either tested and negative or untested for deleterious BRCA mutations. For the entire cohort
the KRAS-variant did not predict worse survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Yet based on
prior evidence that the KRAS-variant is most strongly associated with post-menopausal
ovarian cancer19, we evaluated survival in women over 52 years of age (n=279), an age
considered to be an appropriate surrogate for menopausal status. By Kaplan-Meier analysis,
survival was significantly reduced in post-menopausal KRAS-variant EOC patients (n=59)
compared to non-variant EOC patients (n=220, Figure 1, log rank p = 0.0399, non-KRAS-

variant survival median 60 months, KRAS-variant survival median 34 months). When other
variables including age, stage, grade, histology and treatment center were included with
KRAS-variant status in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model, the KRASvariant was a statistically significant predictor of reduced overall survival for postmenopausal women with EOC (Table 1); the HR for the KRAS-variant was 1.67 (95% CI:
1.09–2.57, p = 0.019).

Author Manuscript

We next evaluated the association of the KRAS-variant with survival in a separate cohort of
EOC patients carrying deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (n=79). EOC patients
carrying BRCA mutations were significantly younger than the EOC patients without BRCA
mutations (52.7 vs 60.8 years of age, p<0.0001). In addition, EOC patients with BRCA
mutations had a significantly longer median survival by multivariate analysis controlling for
age, stage, grade and histology, than EOC patients without BRCA mutations (120 months vs
52 months, p = 0.0036). There was not a significant difference in survival between EOC
patients with BRCA mutations with or without the KRAS-variant in a multivariate analysis
using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model (Supplemental Table 1,
KRAS-variant HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.21–2.72, p = 0.66). There were too few patients to
evaluate the impact of the KRAS-variant on survival in post-menopausal EOC patients
harboring deleterious BRCA mutations.
The KRAS-variant and platinum resistance

Author Manuscript

To gain insight into potential reasons for the reduced survival in post-menopausal KRASvariant positive EOC patients, we evaluated the association of KRAS-variant positivity with
response to platinum-based chemotherapy, the standard first-line chemotherapy in the
treatment of EOC. We first evaluated all women with EOC who were treated at Yale-New
Haven Hospital with neoadjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by surgical
cytoreduction (n = 116), and used residual disease after surgery (cytoreduction) as a
surrogate marker of patient response to chemotherapy. We found that 15.4% of KRASvariant patients (n=26) were suboptimally cytoreduced (>1cm of residual disease after
surgery), compared with only 3.33% of non-variant patients (n=90) (Figure 2, p=0.044). The
KRAS-variant was also significantly associated with suboptimal cytoreduction after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery in a multivariate logistic regression model
controlling for age, stage, grade and histology (Supplemental Table 2, OR = 9.36, 95% CI:
1.34 – 65.22, p = 0.024).

Author Manuscript

To further investigate if the cause of poor response to neoadjuvant platinum-based
chemotherapy seen in KRAS-variant EOC patients was due to resistance to platinum
chemotherapy, we evaluated platinum resistance in all EOC patients treated adjuvantly with
platinum chemotherapy without documented BRCA mutations with available response data
(n=291). We found that platinum resistance (disease recurrence within 6 months of
receiving platinum-based chemotherapy) was significantly more likely in KRAS-variant
positive EOC patients than in non-KRAS-variant EOC patients (16.67% vs 7.56%, p =
0.034). The KRAS-variant was a statistically significant predictor for platinum resistance for
EOC patients of all ages in a multivariate logistic regression analysis controlling for residual

disease remaining after cytoreductive surgery, stage, histology, age and grade (Table 2, OR
= 3.18, 95% CI: 1.31 – 7.72, p = 0.0106).
Gene Expression in KRAS-variant Ovarian Tumors
Gene expression studies were performed on a small cohort of ovarian cancer patients who
had fresh frozen tissue available (Brescia cohort), and compared between seven serous EOC
samples with the KRAS-variant and nine without the variant (n=16). We found that within
this cohort, in post-menopausal EOC patients over 52 years of age with EOC (n=10), that a
gene signature previously found associated with KRAS-variant associated triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC)15 was also upregulated in KRAS-variant associated EOC (Figure 3A).
In addition, again similar to the prior analysis in TNBC, we found overexpression of KRASassociated downstream pathways in EOC KRAS-variant tumors, consistent with “KRAS
addiction”20 (Figure 3B).

Author Manuscript

Using prior analyses of gene expression data identifying platinum resistant versus sensitive
signatures21, we tested and found that KRAS-variant EOC samples had a lower carboplatin
sensitivity signature compared to non-variant EOC samples (Figure 3C). In agreement with
findings in prior studies showing that the activation of the AKT pathway was frequently
involved in platinum resistance, we found that AKT3 was one of the most significantly upregulated transcripts in KRAS-variant EOC tumors (Figure 3D).

Author Manuscript

Although miRNA expression data was not available on tumor samples, we did compare
expression of the let-7b miRNA that had previously been shown to be altered in KRASvariant positive lung tumors 12 and triple negative breast tumors 15, in two cell lines with the
KRAS-variant (BG-1 and IGROV1) compared to a non-variant line (CAOV3). We found
that let-7b was significantly lower in the cells with the KRAS-variant (Supplemental Figure
1), consistent with our prior results, and a recent publication showing the association of low
levels of this miRNA and poor ovarian cancer outcome 22.
The KRAS-variant and chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer cell lines

Author Manuscript

To confirm altered chemosensitivity in the presence of the KRAS-variant, we utilized EOC
cell lines with and without the KRAS-variant and tested their sensitivity to different
chemotherapeutic agents. We tested a cell line that is KRAS-variant positive/BRCA wildtype (BG1), a non-variant/BRCA wild-type cell line (CAOV3), and a cell line KRAS-variant
positive/BRCA1 mutant (IGR-OV1). We found that the KRAS-variant line, BG1, was
significantly resistant to carboplatin (p<0.04) and carboplatin/paclitaxel combination
chemotherapy (p<0.0001) compared to CAOV3, the cell line without the KRAS-variant. In
contrast, IGROV1, the cell line with the KRAS-variant and a deleterious BRCA1 mutation,
was not resistant to these agents compared to CAOV3 (Figure 4). These findings are in
agreement with our clinical findings that the KRAS-variant is associated with platinum
resistance, but perhaps not in the presence of deleterious BRCA mutations.
We additionally evaluated agents frequently used as second-line therapy for patients who
have failed carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy, including doxorubicin, topotecan and

gemcitabine. We found that the KRAS-variant line, BG1, was significantly resistant to each
of these agents compared to CAOV3, the non-variant cell line (Table 3).
Targeting the KRAS-variant

Author Manuscript

Because prior 15 and current gene expression findings suggested a continued use of KRAS
signaling in KRAS-variant associated tumors, we evaluated the impact of directly targeting
this 3′UTR lesion. We designed siRNA/miRNA-like complexes that could directly bind the
altered allele in KRAS-variant transcripts, but not non-KRAS-variant transcripts
(Supplemental Figure 2). We found that transfecting these oligonucleotide duplexes that
target the KRAS-variant caused a significant decrease in cell survival in the KRAS-variant
carrying BG1 cell line (p<0.001), but had no effect in CAOV3 (Figure 5A) or SKOV3 (data
not shown), two non-variant EOC cell lines. This finding was concordant with a moderate
decrease in KRAS protein levels by western blot in BG1, but not in CAOV3 (Figure 5B) or
SKOV3 (data not shown) after treatment.

Discussion
Our data indicate that the KRAS-variant is a biomarker of poor outcome for post-menopausal
women (over 52 years of age) with epithelial ovarian cancer. The poor outcome in KRASvariant associated ovarian cancer may be due to the association of the KRAS-variant with
resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, based on a worse response to neoadjuvant
platinum-based chemotherapy, and significantly increased platinum resistance in adjuvantly
treated EOC patients with the KRAS-variant.

Author Manuscript

The biological differences between KRAS-variant EOC and non-variant EOC tumors are
supported by gene expression data done on available tumors, which suggests KRAS
addiction and AKT-mediated platinum resistance in KRAS-variant EOC. Platinum resistance
was further confirmed in vitro in an ovarian cancer cell line with the KRAS-variant as
compared to a non-variant line. Finally, evidence for the continued dependence of KRASvariant-associated EOC on this germ-line lesion was shown through direct targeting of this
mutation, which led to significant growth and survival inhibition in a KRAS-variant EOC
cell line versus non-variant EOC lines.

Author Manuscript

The association of the KRAS-variant with poor survival specifically for post-menopausal
women could be due to underlying biology associated with this variant, or confounding
effects in these studies. Supporting the hypothesis that this finding reflects underlying
biology, the KRAS-variant is associated with post-menopausal ovarian cancer14
(Supplemental Table 3), with a median age of diagnosis near 59 years of age. It is known
that relative survival varies by age, with older women twice as likely to die within 5 years of
diagnosis of EOC, supporting the hypothesis that post-menopausal women may have
biologically different tumors then younger women23. In addition, the KRAS-variant has been
shown to be a biomarker of triple negative breast cancer risk specifically in pre-menopausal
women, less then 52 years of age15. This may indicate that the role of the KRAS-variant in
cancer risk and biology in different tissues depends on the patient’s hormonal environment,
i.e. menopausal status, and that women with the KRAS-variant may be first at risk for pre-

menopausal breast cancer and subsequently post-menopausal ovarian cancer. Studies are
ongoing to test this hypothesis.

Author Manuscript

However, it is equally plausible that younger women diagnosed with EOC in our cohort
were more likely to have undocumented deleterious BRCA mutations, as BRCA mutation
carriers were significantly younger in these studies. Our findings that the KRAS-variant does
not predict for poor outcome in our cohort of EOC patients with known deleterious BRCA
mutations may be partially explained by the fact that BRCA mutations are associated with
platinum-sensitivity, and this effect may act downstream of any resistance caused or
exacerbated by the KRAS-variant to platinum agents. The younger patients in our cohorts
may also have had other subtypes of ovarian cancer seen more frequently in younger
women, such as borderline tumors, and were perhaps misdiagnosed. Although our data sets
were extremely well clinically annotated, a weakness of our study is that BRCA status was
not obtained on all of our EOC patients, and although pathology reports were available,
tumor tissue was not available for re-review. This does highlight the importance of using
clinically well-annotated data sets to study functional markers such as the KRAS-variant, to
allow appropriate interpretation of the results. A recent study that failed to find the
association of the KRAS-variant with poor outcome and resistance to therapy in EOC24 used
ovarian collections used for genome wide association studies (GWAS) that had very limited
clinical information, and important factors such as BRCA status and ovarian cancer specific
survival were not available nor included in their analyses.

Author Manuscript

The association of the KRAS-variant with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy for
non-BRCA mutant EOC patients is perhaps not surprising, as KRAS pathway disruption has
been associated with platinum resistance in ovarian cancer21,25 as well as several other
cancers26,27. The KRAS-variant has been previously shown to lead to KRAS and associated
downstream pathway overexpression in triple negative breast cancer15, which concords with
our gene expression findings in this study in EOC, even with a small number of tumors
available for study. It is interesting that similar gene mis-expression patterns were found in
two different types of KRAS-variant associated tumors, suggesting that these tumors,
regardless of tissue of origin, perhaps utilize similar pathways in oncogenesis. It would be
important and interesting to validate these findings in larger gene expression data sets as
well as additional tumor types, work that is ongoing.

Author Manuscript

Perhaps most intriguing is the finding that direct targeting of the KRAS-variant lesion in
KRAS-variant associated EOC cell lines leads to significantly enhanced cell death and a
reduction in KRAS levels. While there is considerable work to be done to understand the
mechanisms behind these findings, they do suggesting continued critical dependence of
these tumors on this single, non-coding germ-line lesion. While there has been a significant
effort to tailor cancer treatment by measuring tumor gene expression and determining tumor
acquired mutations, there are few, if any, germ-line variants that have previously been
shown to be critical targets for therapy in cancer.
There is still work to be done to better define the mechanisms of KRAS-variant associated
platinum resistance and its potential as a future target for therapy in EOC. However, this
work supports the conclusions that the KRAS-variant is a functional cancer mutation that is

important in ovarian cancer, and that the KRAS-variant appears to allow meaningful subclassification of the ovarian tumors it is associated with. Hopefully these findings can
ultimately be used to improve ovarian cancer patient outcome.

Materials and Methods
Overall survival analysis cohorts

Author Manuscript

Complete clinical data and DNA from women diagnosed with EOC without known BRCA
mutations were included from the following three institutions under individual IRB
approvals. All protocols accrued patients prospectively at the time of their diagnosis to avoid
selection bias. References indicate previous detailed descriptions of these patients: 1) Turin,
Italy #1 (n=197)28. 2) Brescia, Italy #2 (n=59)14. 3) Yale New Haven Hospital (n=198). The
Yale patients were collected prospectively on two clinical trials at Yale Medical School of
newly diagnosed EOC patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2009. Supplemental Table 3.
Documented BRCA mutant EOC cases with known outcome were collected from the
following two institutions: 1) Yale New Haven Hospital (n=17). 2) City of Hope
Comprehensive Cancer Center (n=62). Supplemental Table 4.

Author Manuscript

As not all stage I ovarian cancer patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy, when substage
information was not available for patients with Stage 1 tumors, these patients were excluded
from the analysis. Otherwise Stage 1B and 1C tumors were included with stage 2–4. To
minimize inadvertent inclusion of borderline tumors, tumors with an unknown grade were
excluded from this analysis. For women treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the date of
pathological diagnosis was considered the start date of treatment. For women treated with
adjuvant chemotherapy the date of surgery was considered the start date of treatment. A total
of 386 patients with wild-type BRCA or not tested for BRCA mutations and 79 patients with
documented BRCA mutations fit the above described parameters and were included in the
two survival analyses.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort

Author Manuscript

Women with EOC who received neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy followed by
cytoreductive surgery at Yale New Haven Hospital between 1996 and 2010 were identified
on an IRB approved protocol (n=125). Supplemental Table 5. This cohort of patients
received chemotherapy as a primary treatment due to tumor burden that was too extensive
for optimal surgical debulking at presentation. Following chemotherapy, patients underwent
cytoreductive surgery and additional adjuvant treatment. Only patients treated with four or
more cycles of neoadjuvant platinum-containing combinations were included in this analysis
(n = 116). Optimal cytoreduction was defined as residual disease measuring less than 1cm
remaining after surgery, while suboptimal cytoreduction was defined as residual disease
measuring greater than or equal to 1cm at the completion of surgery. Only women operated
on at Yale by the same group of surgeons were included, to avoid bias in surgical skill as a
factor impacting residual disease.

Patients for analysis of platinum resistance

Author Manuscript

Platinum resistance was defined as progression-free survival (PFS) of less than 6 months
from the completion of platinum containing adjuvant chemotherapy to the date of
recurrence. The progression-free survival interval was available from women from Italy #1,
Italy #2, and Yale-New Haven Hospital patients (n = 291). Supplemental Table 6 describes
the clinicopathologic parameters of these patients.
Detection of the KRAS-variant

Author Manuscript

DNA was isolated using standard methods from tumor, blood or saliva. As previously
shown19, the KRAS-variant does not appear to be somatically acquired nor does it require a
loss of heterozygosity, so each of these tissues are appropriate to test and the results are
identical regardless of the tissue tested19. The variant allele was detected using a primer
specific to the KRAS-variant and a TaqMan (Applied Biosystems) PCR assay on all samples.
Genotyping was done at YNHH except for on samples from COH, for which the genotyping
was done in their facility. Less than 3% of populations carry two copies of the variant12. As
such, patients who carried at least one copy of the variant allele were classified as KRASvariant carriers.
Gene expression analysis of EOC with and without the KRAS-variant

Author Manuscript

Gene expression in fresh frozen tumor samples from 16 patients (9 non-variant, 7 KRASvariant) was profiled on the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 platform.
All samples were from high-grade serous epithelial ovarian tumors that were stage IIIC or
IV. Images were processed with the MAS5 algorithm and probes that were judged absent in
at least 75% of the samples were removed. Intensity values were log-transformed and
quantile-normalized. Differential gene expression was assessed in samples from patients
over 52 years of age (n=6 non-variant, 4 KRAS-variant) using a linear model and empirical
Bayesian error moderation as implemented in the LIMMA package for R statistical
software29.

Author Manuscript

Association of previously published results with the KRAS-variant in our data set was
assessed using a signature approach in order to reduce cross-platform effects15. Briefly,
signature scores were computed as Pearson correlation between the respective signature
vector of gene contributions and each sample’s expression profile for these genes.
Differences between signature scores in KRAS-variant and non-variant EOC samples were
assessed using paired Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Unless otherwise indicated, gene lists from
the respective publications were used as signature vectors. Data from Peters and
colleagues21 was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE1926) and reanalyzed to
generate a signature from the 50 most significantly differentially expressed genes between
platinum-sensitive and resistant samples.
Chemosensitivity/cell viability assays
The activity of drugs alone or in combination was determined by a high-throughput
CellTiter-Blue cell viability assay. For these assays, 1.2×103 cells were plated in each well
of 384-well plates using a Precision XS liquid handling station (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.,

Winooski, VT) and allowed to attach overnight with incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2. Using the
liquid handling station, all drugs were serially diluted 2:3 or 1:2 in media and 5 μl of these
dilutions were added to appropriate wells at indicated times. Four replicate wells were used
for each drug concentration and an additional four control wells received a diluent control
without drug. At the end of the incubation period with drugs, 5 μl CellTiter-Blue reagent
(Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was added to each well. Cell viability was assessed by the
ability of the remaining viable cells to bioreduce resazurin to resorufin. The fluoresence of
resorufin (579nm Ex/584nm Em) was measured with a Synergy 4 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). The fluorescence data was transferred to Microsoft Excel to calculate
the percent viability relative to the four replicate cell wells that did not receive drug. IC50s
were determined using a sigmoidal equilibrium model regression using XLfit version 5.2
(ID Business Solutions Ltd.). The IC50 was defined as the concentration of drug required
for a 50% reduction in growth/viability. All experiments were carried out a minimum of
three times.

Targeting the KRAS-variant
SiRNA sequences were designed to target the KRAS-variant sequence by placing the SNP at
varying positions of the 6 nucleotides at the 5′ end of the siRNA guide strand corresponding
to the so-called “seed sequence”. Blast searches were performed to minimize crossreactivity. In some of the siRNA sequences DNA nucleotides were introduced in order to
optimize thermoenergetic features for preferred incorporation of the guide strand into the
argonaute effector complex or to increase specificity for the variant. SiRNA guide strand
sequences used in the experiments are as follows (lower case = RNA, upper case = DNA;
GS = guide strand, PS = passenger strand):

The negative control used was purchased from Qiagen (AllStars Negative Control siRNA).
Knockdown efficiency and specificity to the KRAS-variant of these sequences were
confirmed using a dual luciferase assay (data not shown). Oligonucleotide combinations
were annealed using standard conditions and then transfected into cells using standard
protocols. Cell survival was assayed using MTT assays and experiments were done in
quadruplicate, and repeated in four independent experiments for all lines. Cell lysates were
collected 72 hours after transfection and KRAS protein levels measured by Western analysis
using a probe specific to KRAS as previously described19.
Statistics
To assess the significance of demographic variables, a χ2 test or a two-sided Fisher’s exact
test was used for categorical variables. A t test was used for continuous variables, such as
age.

The overall survival time of KRAS-variant and wild-type patients was compared using the
Kaplan-Meier method30, and the statistical significance of the survival curves was
determined by the log-rank test31. A Cox proportional hazards regression model32 was used
to assess the impact of the KRAS-variant and demographic and prognostic variables (age,
stage, grade, and histology) on overall survival.
Multivariate logistic regression analyses33 were used to determine the impact of the KRASvariant and other demographic and prognostic factors on the probability of suboptimal
cytoreduction. Multivariate logistic regression analyses33 were used to assess the association
of the KRAS-variant and other prognostic factors on the probability of platinum resistance.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and
in R 2.12.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

Figure 1. The KRAS-variant predicts significantly worse overall survival for post-menopausal
ovarian cancer patients over 52 years of age

Author Manuscript

Overall survival for ovarian cancer patients with (n=59) and without (n=220) the KRASvariant are compared using Kaplan Meier analysis. Outcome is significantly worse for
KRAS-variant positive EOC patients over 52 years of age by log-rank test (p = 0.0399).

Figure 2. The KRAS-variant is associated with suboptimal debulking after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy

Surgical debulking after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is compared in ovarian cancer patients
(n=116) with the KRAS-variant (n=26) or without (n=90). By chi-squared analysis the
KRAS-variant patients are significantly more likely to be suboptimally debulked with greater
residual disease (RD) than non-variant patients (p=0.044).

Figure 4. The KRAS-variant is associated with resistance to Carboplatin and Carboplatin/Taxol
chemotherapy in cell lines

Cell lines with the KRAS-variant (BG1) and without the KRAS-variant (CAOV3) were
treated with chemotherapy and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) is shown on
the Y-axis, and chemotherapeutic agent on the X-axis. Higher IC50 represents resistance to
the tested chemotherapeutic agent. BG1 = KRAS-variant/BRCA wild-type cell line; CAOV3
= non-variant/BRCA wild-type cell line; IGR-OV1 = KRAS-variant/BRCA1 mutant cell line.
Error bars are RSE.
