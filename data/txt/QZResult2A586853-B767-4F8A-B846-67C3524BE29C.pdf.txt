ABSTRACT
Protein array technology is a powerful platform for the simultaneous
determination of the expression levels of a number of proteins as well as posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation. Here, we screen and report
for the first time, the dominant signaling cascades and apoptotic mediators during
the course of cadmium (Cd)-induced cytotoxicity in human bronchial epithelial cells
(BEAS-2B) by antibody array analyses. Proteins from control and Cd-treated cells were
captured on Proteome Profiler™ Arrays for the parallel determination of the relative
levels of protein phosphorylation and proteins associated with apoptosis. Our results
indicated that the p38 MAPK- and JNK-related signal transduction pathways were
dramatically activated by Cd treatment. Cd potently stimulates the phosphorylations
of p38α (MAPK14), JNK1/2 (MAPK8/9), and JUN; while the phosphorylations of
Akt1, ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1), GSK3ß, and mTOR were suppressed. Moreover, there
was an induction of proapoptotic protein BAX, release of cytochrome c (CYCS) from
mitochondria, activation of caspase-3/9 (CASP3/9); as well as decreased expression
of cell cycle checkpoint proteins (TP53, p21, and p27) and several inhibitors of
apoptosis proteins (IAPs) [including cIAP-1/2 (BIRC2/3), XIAP (BIRC4), and
survivin (BIRC5)]. Pretreatment of cells with the thiol antioxidant glutathione or
p38 MAPK/JNK inhibitors before Cd treatment effectively abrogated ROS activation
of p38 MAPK/JNK pathways and apoptosis-related proteins. Taken together, our
results demonstrate that Cd causes oxidative stress-induced apoptosis; and the p38
MAPK/JNK and mitochondrial pathways are more importantly participated for signal
transduction and the induction of apoptosis in Cd-exposed human lung cells.

INTRODUCTION

well as malignant transformation [7–15]. Since lung is one
of the susceptible organs prone to Cd-induced cytotoxicity
and carcinogenicity [2], therefore, it becomes an urgent
matter to understand more on the action mechanisms of
Cd to the lungs.
In the past, although many studies have been
conducted by scientists to examine the cellular response of
cells challenged with Cd, yet, a more systematic approach
for the determination of changes at post-translational
levels (such as phosphorylation) is lacking [16–21].
Proteomics is a powerful tool to study many proteins in
a single analysis. Therefore, in this study, we resolved to

Toxic metal ions represent health threats to human
lives. In particular, cadmium (Cd) is one of the important
carcinogenic heavy metals that can persist in contaminated
water, food and soil [1]. Cd is also present in cigarette
smokes and airborne particles of polluted air [2, 3].
Studies of the last two decades have established that the
effects of Cd are multifaceted and the cellular response
to Cd is concentration-dependent and cell-type specific
[4–6], which can lead to oxidative stress, promotion of
cell proliferation, acquisition of apoptotic resistance, as

screen and report for the first time, the dominant signaling
cascades and apoptotic mediators during the course of
Cd-induced cytotoxicity in normal human bronchial
epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) by antibody array analyses.
Proteins from control and Cd-treated cells were captured
on Proteome Profiler™ Arrays for the parallel determination
of the relative levels of expression of a panel of
phosphorylated proteins and proteins associated with
apoptosis.
To this end, we identified the proteome changes
associated with Cd induced cytotoxicity in human
bronchial epithelial cells, including ROS activation of
the p38 MAPK/JNK pathways and induction of proteins
involved in intrinsic apoptosis. On the other hand, the key
players of survival signaling pathways (Akt1 and ERK1/2)
were suppressed and there were decreased expression of
cell-cycle checkpoint proteins (TP53, p21 and p27) and
several inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), including
cIAP-1/2, XIAP, and survivin. Pretreatment of cells with
the thiol antioxidant glutathione (GSH) or p38 MAPK/JNK
inhibitors before Cd treatment effectively abrogated ROS
activation of p38 MAPK/JNK pathways and apoptosisrelated proteins. The implications of these findings are that
Cd causes oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in human
lung cells primarily through the p38 MAPK/JNK and
mitochondrial pathways; and the differentially-expressed
protein signatures could be considered for potential use as
biomarkers upon Cd exposure.

ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1), and RSK2 (RPS6KA3) were all
significantly decreased (Figure 1; Supplementary Table S4).

Cd activates the p38 MAPK- and JNK-related
signal transduction pathways in a
time-dependent manner
To further identify the primary signal transduction
pathway induced by Cd, we used a human phosphokinase array comprising 43 kinase phosphorylation sites,
including also kinases from the phospho-MAPK array.
This time, BEAS-2B cells were sham-exposed or treated
with 30 µM CdCl2 for 6, 12, and 24 h. After treatment,
total cell extracts were isolated and subjected to human
phospho-kinase array analysis. As shown in Figure 2,
again, the p38 MAPK- and JNK-related signal transduction
pathways were strongly activated by Cd treatment
(with MAPK14 increased 3.45-fold and MAPK8/9 2.85fold). HSPB1, CREB1 and JUN (c-Jun), which are wellknown substrates of p38 MAPK and JNK, were also
dramatically elevated in phosphorylation upon Cd treatment
(with HSPB1 increased 4.14-fold, CREB1 1.76-fold,
and JUN 6.00-fold) (Figure 2). Consistent with the
phospho-MAPK array results, some of the key players of
survival signaling and energy metabolic pathways (p-Akt1,
p-mTOR, p-EGFR and p-MAPK3/1), were significantly
suppressed (Figure 2; Supplementary Table S5).
Interestingly, we found that the phosphorylations of TP53
at S15 and S46 (which are important phosphorylation
sites for stress responses) were also decreased, whereas
several of the STAT family members, including STAT3,
STAT5A/B and STAT6, were all increased. Lastly, the
levels of p-PRKAA2 (p-5ʹ-AMP-activated protein kinase
catalytic subunit alpha-2), CTNNB1 (Catenin beta-1), and
HSPD1 (HSP60) were also moderately increased, while
the autophosphorylation levels of several tyrosine kinases
like Src, Fyn, Hck, FAK1, as well as the phosphorylation
levels of 40 kDa proline-rich Akt substrate (PRAS40), were
moderately decreased (Figure 2; Supplementary Table S5).
To ensure if the altered phosphorylation in
phospho-MAPK and phospho-kinase arrays are due to
upstream regulation instead of simply due to altered
protein amounts, we performed western blot analyses
using the same cell lysates that were used for antibody
array analyses (Supplementary Figure S1A). Our results
indicated that among the majority of proteins with
increased or decreased in phosphorylations, except for
HSPB1 and TP53, most of them have no alteration in total
protein levels, indicating that the altered phosphorylation
is likely due to upstream regulation.

RESULTS
The p38 MAPK- and JNK-related signal
transduction pathways are dramatically
activated by Cd treatment
From our previous study, we examined the
cytotoxicity of CdCl2 in human bronchial epithelial cells
(BEAS-2B) and showed that the lethal concentration range
is around 20–30 µM post 36 h of CdCl2 treatment [22].
In this study, we therefore wish to examine the dominant
signaling cascades and apoptotic mediators during the
course of Cd-induced cytotoxicity. First, to dissect the
early cellular response to Cd, BEAS-2B cells were
sham-exposed or treated with 100 µM CdCl2 for 3 h
(a higher concentration of Cd has been employed as in
many studies to study early signaling events) [11, 12, 23].
After treatment, total cell extracts were isolated and
subjected to human phospho-MAPK array analysis.
Overall, the results indicated that the p38α (MAPK14) and
JNK1/2 (MAPK8/9) showed the greatest fold of increase
in phosphorylations (with MAPK14 increased 25.34-fold,
MAPK8 10.93-fold, and MAPK9 8.31-fold), as compared
with the untreated control (Figure 1). Other proteins which
also showed increase of phosphorylations included CREB1
(2.54-fold) and HSP27 (HSPB1) (1.98-fold). On the other
hand, the phosphorylations of Akt1, mTOR, GSK3β,

related-proteins. BEAS-2B cells were sham-exposed
or treated with 30 µM CdCl2 for 24 h, total cell extracts
were isolated and then subjected to human apoptosis array
analysis. As shown in Figure 3, the proapoptotic protein
BAX and active caspase-3 (CASP3) were increased
by 1.85-fold and 2.45-fold, respectively. Several other
proteins were also induced, like catalase (CAT) (1.62-fold),
clusterin (CLU) (2.11-fold), hypoxia-inducible factor
1-alpha (HIF1A) (2.31-fold), and heme oxygenase
1 (HMOX1) (2.38-fold). Interestingly, the expression of
several inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), including
cIAP-1 (BIRC2), cIAP-2 (BIRC3), XIAP (BIRC4), and
survivin (BIRC5), were significantly suppressed. Other

proteins which showed significant suppression included
claspin (CLSPN) [an essential replication checkpoint
control protein], high temperature requirement protein
A2 (HTRA2) [a serine protease that is involved in
the degradation of aberrantly folded proteins during
conditions of cellular stress], cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor 1 (CDKN1A/p21), cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B/p27), and tumor necrosis factor
receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A) (Figure 3;
Supplementary Table S6). Again, to confirm the data from
the apoptosis array analyses, we performed western blot
analyses using the same cell lysates that were used for
antibody array analyses (Supplementary Figure S1B).
Our results indicated that similar trend of induction or

potential (∆ψ). BEAS-2B cells were sham-exposed
or dosed with 30 µM CdCl2 for 18 h. JC-1 assay was
conducted as described in Materials and Methods for the
determination of mitochondrial membrane integrity. As we
can see in Figure 4A, JC-1 aggregates (red colors) were
robustly observed in control cells which indicate cells
are healthy and with an intact mitochondrial potential.
However, for Cd-treated cells, the red colors were visiblydiminished, suggesting the collapses of mitochondrial
potential, and JC-1 dye is no longer accumulated
within the mitochondria, but dispersed to the cytoplasm
(green colors). To further verify the results from apoptosis
array that BAX is induced upon Cd treatment, BEAS-2B

in Cd-treated BEAS-2B cells
Since 30 µM CdCl2 treatment induced cell death
in BEAS-2B cells with the induction of proapoptotic

would like to check the integrity of mitochondria. We
used the JC-1 Mitochondria Apoptosis Detection Kit

cells were sham-exposed or dosed with increasing
concentrations of CdCl2 for 36 h; cells were lysed; and
protein extracts were subjected to western blot analysis
using antibodies against BAX (Figure 4B). The results
indicated that BAX is induced in a dose-dependent
manner, which would likely accelerate programmed cell
death by binding to mitochondrion membrane, leading to
the release of cytochrome c (CYCS), promoting activation
of caspases, and triggering apoptosis.

induced the activation of p38 MAPK, JNK and c-Jun in a
time-dependent manner. Moreover, we checked the
expression levels of other important apoptosis mediators
that covered in the apoptosis array by western blot analysis
[we also performed on caspase-9 (CASP9) and poly
[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) as they were not
included in the format of protein arrays]. In the previous
section, although the results from apoptosis array showed
that there is no difference in CYCS levels between control
and Cd-treated cells, however, we wonder that possibly
because of no prior subcellular fractionation (just a whole
cell lysate analysis), which didn’t address whether there
is release of CYCS from mitochondria to the cytosol.
Therefore, we performed subcellular fractionation and
examine again the level of CYCS. This time, we can see
that indeed CYCS is increased in the cytosolic fraction
upon Cd treatment (Figure 5B). The induction/cleavage
of BAX/CYCS/CASP9/CASP3/PARP1 can well be

observed, suggesting that Cd-induced apoptosis is likely
executed through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.
Our previous study reported that Cd-induced
cytotoxicity through oxidative stress and along with the
expression of a panel of stress/defense proteins, and the Cdinduced cytotoxicity can be blocked by pretreating the cells
with the thiol antioxidant GSH [22, 24]. Therefore, we
investigated the protective ability of intracellular GSH in
the induction/repression of some of the important proteins
that we identified in this study. First, we further proved
that Cd-induced oxidative stress is due to ROS generation,
as we can see that treatment with CdCl2 resulted in
a rapid elevation of ROS generation in BEAS-2B
cells as early as 30 min-treatment (Supplementary
Figure S2). As shown in Figure 5, pretreatment of cells
with GSH efficiently abrogated the activation of p38

MAPK, JNK, and c-Jun (Figure 5A, lane 5), moreover,
the same trend also occurred to BAX, CYCS, CASP9,
CASP3, and PARP1, in which their induction or cleavage
are blocked by GSH pretreatment (Figure 5B, lane 5).

Inhibition of Cd-induced p38/JNK activity by
specific kinase inhibitors, SB203580 and JNK
inhibitor VIII
To show that a high level of Cd exposure induces the
p38/JNK pathways and leads to apoptosis, BEAS-2B cells
were left untreated or pretreated with 20 µM SB203580
or 40 µM JNK inhibitor VIII for 1 h before exposure to
30 µM Cd for 24 h. They were then subjected to western
blot analysis for the levels of BAX, CASP9, and CASP3.

DISCUSSION

and CASP3, compared with controls (Figure 6A). This
stimulation can be blocked by SB203580/JNK inhibitor
VIII (although not as effective as by GSH pretreatment).
In the absence of p38/JNK inhibitor pretreatment, massive
cytotoxicity can be observed by Cd treatment (Figure 6B).
These results suggest that cell death correlates with
Cd-induced p38/JNK activity in BEAS-2B cells.
Altogether, these data confirm that the p38 MAPK and
JNK signaling pathways are critical for mediating the
ROS stress signal exerted by Cd. Also, the mitochondrial
pathway accelerates programmed cell death, due to
the release of CYCS and the subsequent activation of
CASP9/3, and the execution of cleavage of a variety of
caspase substrates, including PARP1; which are key
indicators of intrinsic apoptosis.

In the past, many studies have been conducted
to examine the cellular response of cells challenged
with toxic metal(s), however, to our knowledge, a more
systematic approach for the determination of changes
at post-translational levels (such as phosphorylation) is
lacking [16–21]. Therefore, it is important to further study
the cellular effects at post-translational levels with the aim
of identifying proteins whose activities are specifically
modified by toxic metal exposure. For instance, most
kinase signaling pathways are stimulated rapidly by posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation of
downstream proteins and effectors; while many other
proteins are controlled by proteolytic cleavage (such as

before exposed to 30 µM CdCl2 for 24 (A) or 36 h (B). The same blot was stripped and reprobed with the monoclonal β-actin antibody to
monitor the loading difference. The results are representative of three independent experiments.

caspases) and the subcellular localization of proteins are
critical determinants of their cellular activities. All these
cannot be determined merely at transcriptional levels.
In this study, we resolved to screen and report for the
first time, the dominant signaling cascades and apoptotic
mediators during the course of Cd-induced cytotoxicity
in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B)
by antibody array analyses. Proteins from control and
Cd-treated cells were captured on Proteome Profiler™
Arrays for the parallel determination of the relative levels
of expression of a panel of phosphorylated proteins and
proteins associated with apoptosis. This would hopefully
provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of
action of Cd and allow development of sensitive and

specific biomarkers of both exposure and susceptibility
for use in both mechanistic and epidemiological studies.
However, we want to emphasize for the fact that currently
there is no corresponding expression-array available for
this commercial phospho-kinase array, therefore, whether
the altered phosphorylation is due to upstream regulation
or simply due to altered protein amounts is uncertain. To
this end, we therefore performed western blot analyses
using the same cell lysates that were used for protein
array analyses on most of the major proteins that showed
significant difference between control and Cd-treatment
(Supplementary Figure S1A). Our results indicated that
among the majority of proteins with increased or decreased
in phosphorylations, except for TP53 and HSPB1, most of

them have no alteration in total protein levels, indicating
that the altered phosphorylation is likely due to upstream
regulation.
Although it is likely that the decreased phosphor­
ylation levels (S15 and S46) of TP53 observed in protein
array experiments are merely due to reduced expression
of TP53, no matter how, we believe that the total protein
amount of TP53 is obviously decreased significantly. The
consequence of p53 under-expression is significant as p53
is the principal guardian in maintaining genome stability
such that reduced or diminished p53 could then lead to
defects in cell cycle check points and DNA repair. As a
matter of fact, our western blot analysis also confirmed
the decreased expression of p21 and p27 in Cd-treated
cells, which may further render the cells deficient in
cell cycle arrest for proper repair. For HSPB1, it is well
documented that its protein and phosphorylation levels are
increased during stress condition; in our cell model, the
increased phosphorylation levels (S78 and S82) of HSPB1
observed in phospho-MAPK and phospho-kinase arrays
are likely due to up-regulation of HSPB1 protein amount,
since we also observed the increase of HSPB1 protein
level in apoptosis array and western blot analysis. For
HSPD1, it is implicated in mitochondrial protein import
and macromolecular assembly, its elevation may prevent
misfolding and promote the refolding and proper assembly
of unfolded polypeptides generated under stress conditions
in the mitochondrial matrix.
By analyzing the protein list in IPA® database,
we are able to examine their relationships in details and
summarize the more importantly participated signaling
molecules and apoptotic mediators in this study. For a
better visualization of the results, we basically clustered
the stimulated/activated proteins (red colors) on the left

half while inhibited/suppressed proteins (green colors) on
the right half as shown in Figure 7. So, upon Cd insults,
oxidative stress arises from ROS generation, which
activates the p38 MAPK- and SAPK/JNK- signaling and
related downstream cascades and stimulates stress gene
expressions. The upregulation of antioxidant enzyme CAT
in cells served to remedy the imbalance of redox status by
degrading superoxide radicals. HMOX1 was also induced,
it has been reported that HMOX1 is highly inducible by its
substrate heme and by various non-heme substances such
as heavy metals, growing evidence shows that HMOX1
can exert antiproliferative and antiapoptotic effects and
participate in general cellular defense mechanism against
oxidative stress in mammalian cells [25, 26]. Our data are
in agreement with previous reports which demonstrated
oxidative stress-induced CAT and HMOX1 up-regulations
in human BEAS-2B and rat lung epithelial cells [27, 28].
Meanwhile, the expression of CLU was also significantly
elevated in Cd-treated BEAS-2B cells. The function of
CLU in promotion of cell death has been demonstrated
in cultured mouse seminiferous tubules [29]. However,
it has also been shown that mitochondrial CLU isoforms
suppress BAX-dependent release of CYCS into the
cytoplasm and inhibit apoptosis [30]. Nevertheless, if the
intracellular detoxification/anti-apoptosis/survival system
cannot cope with the detrimental effects exerted by Cd,
apoptotic cascade has to be inevitably activated in order
to eliminate damaged cells. Our data showed that the
proapoptotic protein BAX is stimulated in BEAS-2B cells
dosed with Cd. We also demonstrated that CYCS is release
to the cytosol (CYCS release is a key indicator of intrinsic
apoptosis). The upregulation of BAX and release of CYCS
led to mitochondrial dysfunction (as supported by JC-1
assay on loss of mitochondrial potential); causing gradual

failure of energy powerhouse of the cells, and subsequently
activated the cleavage of CASP9/3 and PARP1. On the
other hand, the expressions of cell cycle checkpoint
(G1/S or G2/M) proteins, like TP53, p21 and p27 are all
suppressed, which may likely making cells deficient in
cell cycle arrest for proper repair. Also, the suppressed
expression of TNFRSF1A may lead to inhibition
of cell survival [31]. Moreover, the phosphorylations
of several key players in cell survival and energy
metabolic pathways (Akt1, mTOR, GSK3β and MAPK1)
as well as the expressions of inhibitors of apoptosis
proteins (BIRC2/3/4/5) were all diminished, all these
events finally contributed to the cell death of BEAS-2B
lung cells.
Although the IPA® analysis cannot provide a
plausible relationship of various STATs (STAT3/5A/5B/6)
and HIF1A to cell death of normal human bronchial
epithelial cells that we reported here, we are of the
opinion that they may also be important factors that are
involved during the course of Cd-induced apoptosis. It
has been shown that chronic low concentrations of Cd
exposure increases HIF1A and VEGF expression through
ROS, ERK, and Akt signaling pathways and induces
malignant transformation of human bronchial epithelial
cells [32], and Cd induced STAT3 activation in HepG2
cells and STAT1/3 phosphorylations in renal proximal
tubular epithelial cells [33, 34]. However, no reports have
indicated so far for Cd’s effects on the phosphorylations
of STAT5A/B and STAT6, which warrant further
investigation. Suffice to say, our data showed that the
ROS generation and activation of p38 MAPK- and
JNK-related signal transduction pathways are vital in
mediating Cd-induced apoptosis in normal human lung
cells. Since pretreatment of GSH or p38/JNK inhibitors
prior to Cd effectively abrogated the activation of p38
MAPK/JNK pathways and apoptosis-related proteins in
this cell type. Besides, the emergence of mitochondrial
dysfunction, deficiency of cell cycle checkpoint proteins,
decreased expression of IAPs and diminished survival
signaling are also critical which finally contributed to the
death fate of BEAS-2B epithelial cells (Figure 7).
In conclusion, we have presented a more global and
updated picture of Cd-induced apoptosis in normal human
lung cells. Our study also demonstrated the competency
of antibody array technology in toxicological research,
which might hopefully identify potential biomarkers and
lead to the development of agents that can antagonize the
cytotoxic effects exerted by toxicants.

Cell culture
The human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B)
was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) (Rockville, MD). BEAS-2B cells were isolated
from normal human bronchial epithelium obtained from
autopsy of a non-cancerous individual. Cells were routinely
grown in LHC-9 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY)
at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air as recom­
mended by ATCC. LHC-9 is a defined, serum-free
medium which is prepared by mixing LHC basal medium
with growth factors, cytokines, and supplements; and has
been described previously [35].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials

Cd treatment

Cadmium chloride (CdCl2) was purchased from
Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The p38 MAPK inhibitor
SB203580 (sc-3533) was purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The JNK inhibitor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cells were grown to 75% confluence in 60 mM cell
culture dishes and then rinsed with Hank’s balanced salt
solution (HBSS) before they were either sham-exposed

or treated with different concentrations of CdCl2 in
LHC-9 medium. Cells were pretreated with GSH or p38
MAPK/JNK inhibitors for 1 h before the addition of Cd.

The Mitochondria Apoptosis Detection Kit (JC-1)
was purchased from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ).
This Kit provides a simple, fluorescent-based method
for distinguishing between healthy and apoptotic
cells by detecting the loss of the mitochondrial
transmembrane potential (∆ψ). The kit utilizes the
unique lipophilic cationic dye (5, 5′, 6, 6′-tetrachloro-1,
1′, 3, 3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodine,
commonly known as JC-1) for detection. In healthy cells,
the negative charge established by the intact mitochondrial
membrane potential allows the lipophilic dye, bearing a
delocalized positive charge, to enter the mitochondrial
matrix where it accumulates. With the increasing of
the concentration of JC-1, it aggregates and becomes
fluorescent red. When the mitochondrial potential
collapses in apoptotic cells, JC-1 just exists as monomers
and do not accumulate within the mitochondria. When
dispersed in this manner, JC-1 remains in the cytoplasm
in a green fluorescent monomeric form. The fluorescent
signals were examined by laser-scanning confocal
microscopy (OLYMPUS FV1000), using FITC channel
for green monomers and PI channel for red aggregates.
Reproducibility was confirmed in three separate
experiments and representative data were shown.

Cell lysate preparation
After treatment, cells were rinsed with PBS and
extracted with Lysis buffer 6 (provided in the Human
Phospho-MAPK and Human Phospho-Kinase Array Kit)
or Lysis buffer 17 (provided in the Human Apoptosis
Array Kit). After incubating and rocking at 4°C for 30 min,
the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 5 min,
supernates were transferred into clean tubes and subjected
to protein quantification. For subcellular proteins
preparation, the cytosolic fraction was prepared using the
Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.

Protein array analysis
Analysis of proteins by Human Phospho-MAPK,
Human Phospho-Kinase and Human Apoptosis Arrays
was conducted following the manufacturer’s instructions.
In brief, protein sample was incubated with each array at
4°C overnight on a rocking platform shaker. The unbound
proteins were removed, and the arrays were washed three
times with washing buffer. Arrays were incubated with
the primary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature
and then washed three times with washing buffer. The
secondary antibody solution was then added to the arrays
on a rocking platform shaker for 1 h. The arrays were
washed three times with washing buffer, and protein spots
were visualized using the chemiluminescence detection
reagents supplied in the Array Kits. The intensity score of
each duplicated array spot was measured with the ImageJ
(version 1.37v) software program, and the averaged
intensity was calculated by subtracting the averaged
background signal. The fold change was obtained by
comparing Cd-treated samples with the untreated control
(indicated as a value of 1). The identity and the respective
coordinates of all the antibodies on the arrays can be found
in “Supplementary Material”.

Measurement of ROS generation
ROS levels were determined by incubating the
cells in LHC-9 media with 2 µM dihydroethidium
(DHE, Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were
washed three times with DPBS and replaced with new
LHC-9 media, and then treated with 30 or 100 µM CdCl2
for different time. After treatment, cells were trypsinized
and fluorescence was measured using BD Accuri™ C6
flow cytometer with excitation and emission wavelengths
at 535 nm and 610 nm, respectively.

Bioinformatic analyses
Differentially-stimulated/inhibited proteins were
listed and the data were analyzed through the use of
QIAGEN’s Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®, QIAGEN
Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity), to highlight
the relationships among candidate proteins using networks
and canonical pathways. Ingenuity Knowledge Base,
the core behind IPA®, provides a wide range of highquality detailed information, including direct and indirect
protein interaction networks, thus aiding the generation
of hypotheses for a comprehensive analysis of a large
number of data.

Conditions of western blot
For western blot analysis, equal amounts of
proteins were fractionated on appropriate percentage of
SDS–polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After the transfer,
the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk
in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and probed with
various primary antibodies. After incubation with
secondary antibodies, immunoblots were visualized
with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (GE
Healthcare). Reproducibility was confirmed in three
separate experiments and representative data were shown.
