BACKGROUND: The authors prospectively evaluated the correlation between technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) accumulation in tumors and response to induction chemotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: Eighty-six patients with locally advanced NPC underwent single-photon emission computed tomography 15 minutes after an intravenous injection of 740 megabecquerels (20 mCi) 99mTc-MIBI before
chemotherapy. The tumor uptake ratio (TUR) was calculated. Two weeks after the second cycle of combined chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (DDP), the tumor response rate was evaluated. The correlation
between 99mTc-MIBI accumulation in tumors and response to chemotherapy with 5-FU/DDP was examined. RESULTS:
Positive accumulation of 99mTc-MIBI in tumors was observed in 76 patients (88.4%). The tumor response was a complete response (CR) in 8 patients, a partial response (PR) in 68 patients, stable disease (SD) in 9 patients, and progressive disease (PD) in 1 patient. The response rate (CR and PR) to 5-FU/DDP chemotherapy in patients who had
positive 99mTc-MIBI accumulation (tumor uptake ratio [TUR] >1.1) was higher than that in patients who had negative
99m
Tc-MIBI accumulation (TUR 1.1; 98.7% vs 10%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with negative 99mTc-MIBI accumulation were resistant to 5-FU/DDP chemotherapy. 99mTc-MIBI imaging in patients with NPC was capable of predicting tumor response to chemotherapy with 5-FU/DDP and can help in the selection of patients for induction

Radiation therapy (RT) traditionally has been the standard treatment for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC). Although NPC is radiosensitive, the long-term survival of patients with advanced disease remains poor, and they
have a high incidence of locoregional and distant failure.1-4 To improve the prognosis, a variety of treatment regimens
have been tested combining chemotherapy and RT in different schemes over the past decade, including induction chemotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. However, to date, the best sequence has not been
established.
The main potential advantage of induction chemotherapy is that it may eradicate distant micrometastasis and
decrease the tumor volume before radiation. It facilitates the delivery of chemotherapy at dose intensities that are not usually tolerated when chemotherapy is given in the concurrent or adjuvant setting. According to meta-analyses, the addition
of cisplatin-based induction chemotherapy to RT in NPC was associated with a decrease in recurrence rates by 14.3% and
in cancer-related deaths by 12.9% at 5 years.5 However, a disadvantage of induction chemotherapy is the delay of definitive RT or the possibility of tumor progression while receiving chemotherapy in multidrug-resistant patients. Combined

cisplatin (DDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is the most
commonly used regimen in NPC, with reported response
rates that average 73% to 93%.6-9 If patients with chemotherapy-resistant NPC were screened out before treatment, then they would be spared from ineffective
induction chemotherapy.
Multidrug resistance may be the major barrier to efficient chemotherapy for cancer. One of the important
mechanisms that leads to multidrug resistance is the
increased expression of 170-kDa P-glycoprotein (P-gp),
which acts as an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent
efflux pump for several cytotoxic drugs.10 Technetium99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI), a lipophilic cation that originally was developed for scintigraphic evaluation of coronary blood flow,11,12 has been
used to predict chemotherapy sensitivity and to detect
functional P-gp expression in some types of cancers.13-19
99m
Tc-MIBI is taken up passively into the mitochondria
in metabolically active cancer cells and then exported
from cells by P-gp.20,21 Thus, tumors that have low levels
of 99mTc-MIBI accumulation likely have high P-gp activity. Significant correlations have been reported between
99m
Tc-MIBI scintigraphy and P-gp immunohistochemistry, response to chemotherapy, and/or patient outcomes
in several types of malignancies.13-19
To our knowledge, the correlation between the
extent of 99mTc-MIBI accumulation and response to
chemotherapy has not been addressed previously in
patients with head and neck cancer. Therefore, we used
99m
Tc-MIBI scintigraphy in patients with locally
advanced NPC who were receiving induction chemotherapy. In this study, we evaluated whether the results from
99m
Tc-MIBI scintigraphy were correlated with chemotherapeutic effects and whether they can be used to
provide useful information for the selection of chemotherapy-sensitive patients with NPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patients who fulfilled all of the following criteria were eligible for this study: biopsy-proven, World Health Organization Type II or Type III NPC; stage T3 or T4 disease
according to the 2002 American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) staging system (the smallest dimension of
the primary tumor had to be 20 mm with no gross evidence of distant metastasis and adequate hematologic
function, including a total leukocyte count [white blood
cells] 4000/lL and platelets 100,000/lL); adequate

2436

renal function (creatinine clearance 60 mL/minute);
and a satisfactory Karnofsky performance status (80).
Exclusion criteria included age 70 years or <18 years,
pregnancy or lactation, a history of previous treatment, or
a previous malignancy.
99m

Tc-MIBI Scintigraphy
Anterior and posterior planar views were obtained before
chemotherapy, and a 360 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) nasopharyngeal image was
obtained 15 minutes after an intravenous injection of 740
megabecquerels (20 mCi) 99mTc-MIBI. The equipment
consisted of a rotating and large field-of-view gamma
camera (General Electric Company, Waukesha, Wis) fitted with a low-energy, high-resolution collimator (collection energy, 140 KeV; window width, 20%). Sixty images
were acquired, each from a 20-second exposure, during a
360-degree camera rotation. Transverse, coronal, and
sagittal sections were reconstructed with attenuation correction using Hann filters (cutoff frequency ¼ 10) to produce SPECT images. The findings from 99mTc-MIBI
nasopharyngeal images were evaluated both qualitatively
and quantitatively. SPECT images were interpreted visually by 2 independent nuclear medicine physicians before
chemotherapy, and a consensus was reached regarding the
findings. Images were defined as positive (focal abnormal
accumulation at the tumor site) (Fig. 1A,B) or negative
(no abnormal focus of activity at the tumor site) (Fig.
2A,B).13,17 The tumor uptake ratio (TUR) was obtained
from a coronal nasopharyngeal image. A region of interest
(ROI) was carefully drawn over the tumor. Then, another
ROI of the same size was drawn over the lateral pterygoid
muscle. The TUR was calculated using the following formula18: TUR ¼ (total counts in the ROI over the tumor)/
(total counts in the same size ROI over the lateral pterygoid muscle).
Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
The chemotherapy regimen consisted of 2 cycles of DDP
100 mg/m2 as a rapid intravenous infusion on Day 1 and
5-FU 750 mg/m2 daily as a continuous intravenous infusion on Days 1 through 5 repeated every 21 days. All
patients received an antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of
5-hydroxy-tryptamine-3 receptor antagonists plus 20 mg
of dexamethasone.
Evaluation of Chemotherapy Response
All patients had magnetic resonance (MR) images
obtained before treatment and 2 weeks after the second

acquired with a General Electric 1.5-Tesla unit using a
head and neck coil. T1-weighted, fast spin-echo images in
the axial and sagittal planes (repetition time [TR], 400500 msec; echo time [TE], 10-15 msec) and T2-weighted,
fast spin echo images in the axial plane (TR, 4000-5000

mm with a 1-mm interslice gap for the axial plane and 4
mm without an interslice gap for the coronal and sagittal
planes. Response to chemotherapy was evaluated on T1weighted, FSPGR, fat-suppressed MR images according

Tc-MIBI Accumulation in NPC
According to the quantitative evaluation, positive accumulation of 99mTc-MIBI in tumors was observed in 76 of
86 patients (88.4%), and negative accumulation was
observed in 10 of 86 patients (11.6%), as interpreted by
the nuclear physicians. Further analysis indicated that the
overall TUR was 1.1 (range, 0.9-1.1) in the 10 negative
patients and >1.1 (range, 1.1-5.4) in the 76 positive
patients. The correlation between 99mTc-MIBI accumulation and tumor classification is detailed in Table 2.
Tumor Response Rate
Two weeks after the second cycle of chemotherapy with
5-FU/DDP, the responses were as follows: a complete
response (CR) was attained in 8 patients, a partial
response (PR) was attained in 68 patients, 9 patients had

stable disease (SD), and 1 patient had progressive disease
(PD) according to evaluations by diagnostic radiologists.

the clinicians, who established the correlation between

Tc-MIBI tumor accumulation and response to DDP/

P < .001).

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we demonstrated a significant correlation between pretherapy 99mTc-MIBI accumulation in
tumor and tumor response to chemotherapy. Patients
who had negative 99mTc-MIBI accumulation had less
sensitivity to 5-FU/DDP compared with patients who
had positive 99mTc-MIBI accumulation, suggesting that
99m
Tc-MIBI can help to select patients for effective induction chemotherapy with 5-FU/DDP.
Regarding 99mTc-MIBI and P-gp, previous studies
have demonstrated a significant correlation between
99m
Tc-MIBI accumulation and P-gp expression in several
types of cancers.13-19 To our knowledge, the current study
is the first report of 99mTc-MIBI in patients with NPC.
Piwnica-Worms et al.23 reported that the uptake of
99m
Tc-MIBI was increased approximately 10 times in
cells that had low expression of P-gp. In addition, after the
application of drugs that can inhibit the activity of P-gp,
such as verapamil and cyclosporine, the uptake of 99mTcMIBI increased approximately 200 times in cells that had
abundant P-gp expression. These findings strongly indicate that 99mTc-MIBI is a suitable substrate of P-gp.
Several methods, such as Northern or Western blot
analyses and immunohistochemistry, have been used to
evaluate P-gp expression in cancer tissues. However, these

results may not fully represent all tumor characteristics,
because most specimens were obtained from small parts of
heterogeneous and large tumors and may not have
accounted for the characteristics of the entire tumor. This
is especially true in NPC, because radiation therapy is the
standard treatment for NPC, and it is impossible to acquire large cancer specimens. In contrast, 99mTc-MIBI
imaging can evaluate the entire tumor noninvasively,
allowing for repeated assessments, and can serve as a surrogate for P-gp expression in the whole tumor.
Concerned with the correlation between the chemotherapeutic effect and 99mTc-MIBI accumulation, several
other studies have demonstrated that chemotherapy with
doxorubicin is more effective in patients who have greater
99m
Tc-MIBI accumulation with lung cancer,14-16 breast
cancer,13 and bone and soft tissue tumors.19 Our results
indicate that patients with NPC who had intense 99mTcMIBI accumulation had greater sensitivity to 5-FU/DDP
chemotherapy, consistent with those previous reports. In
addition to P-gp expression in tumor tissues, 99mTc-MIBI
accumulation in tumors can be affected by many factors,
such as blood flow, tissue viability, vascular permeability,
tumor necrosis, metabolic demand, and mitochondrial
activity of the tumor.24 We believe that those factors may
be responsible for poor responses to 5-FU/DDP

chemotherapy even in patients with greater 99mTc-MIBI
accumulation.
Recently, induction chemotherapy with a docetaxel,
DDP, and 5-FU triple-combination regimen (TPF) has
been widely investigated in head and neck cancer; and
large-scale randomized trials have demonstrated the benefits of TPF compared with DDP/5-FU.25,26 Induction
chemotherapy with docetaxel-based or paclitaxel-based
combination regimens followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy also demonstrated promising results in
patients with locally advanced NPC.27,28 In vitro and in
vivo studies also have demonstrated a correlation between
P-gp expression and docetaxel/paclitaxel resistance.29-31 It
remains to be determined whether 99mTc-MIBI imaging
can predict the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy with
docetaxel-based or paclitaxel-based regimens.
In conclusion, 99mTc-MIBI imaging in NPC can
predict tumor response to chemotherapy with DDP/
5-FU. The current results have demonstrated that DDP/
5-FU is less active in patients who have negative
99m
Tc-MIBI accumulation.
