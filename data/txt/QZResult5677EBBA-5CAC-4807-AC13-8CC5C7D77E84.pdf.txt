BACKGROUND: Endocrine measures of ovarian reserve before breast cancer treatment may predict postchemotherapy ovarian function, providing prognostic information at the time of cancer diagnosis. The objectives of this study were 1) to determine whether prechemotherapy levels of antimullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and inhibin B (inhB) are associated with
the return of ovarian function after chemotherapy and 2) to generate a prognostic score for ovarian recovery in young women with
breast cancer. METHODS: A prospective cohort study recruited 109 participants (median age, 39 years; age range, 23-45 years)
before chemotherapy from 2 breast clinics and followed them longitudinally. By using time-to-event analysis, the authors tested the
association between prechemotherapy AMH, FSH, and inhB levels and the time to return of ovarian function, as measured by menstrual pattern. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 163 days (range, 4-1009 days) after chemotherapy, 62 participants (57%) experienced return of ovarian function. In adjusted analyses, AMH levels >0.7 ng/mL (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.6) and
FSH levels 10 IU/L (hazard ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-16.8) were associated with a shorter time to ovarian recovery,
whereas inhB levels were not related. A prognostic score based on age <40 years, AMH >0.7 ng/mL, and body mass index 25 kg/
m2 was used to estimate the timing of recovery. CONCLUSIONS: In reproductive-aged women with newly diagnosed breast cancer,
prechemotherapy AMH and FSH levels were associated with the return of ovarian function, independent of age. A novel prognostic
score incorporating AMH, age, and body size was capable of estimating the time to ovarian recovery. Pending validation, these data
support using prechemotherapy ovarian reserve measures, particularly AMH, to prospectively counsel young patients on future ovarian function. Because ovarian function is not equivalent to fertility, follow-up studies on predicting fertility are needed. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in reproductive-aged women, with approximately 15,000 new cases in the
United States each year.1 Most young women diagnosed with breast cancer will receive chemotherapy. Although chemotherapy improves cancer outcomes, it also induces ovarian damage by direct toxicity to the finite pool of ovarian follicles.2
Consequently, young breast cancer survivors face greater risks of infertility, primary ovarian insufficiency, and early menopause.3,4 Postchemotherapy ovarian function is also important in relation to adjuvant endocrine therapy decisions, cancer
recurrence, and survival.5 Hence, prognostic information on postchemotherapy ovarian function that is available at the
time of cancer diagnosis can help inform decisions from fertility preservation to the selection of appropriate antiestrogen
therapy. Despite clinical relevance, there are limited data on predicting postchemotherapy ovarian function.6-9
Postchemotherapy ovarian function is most commonly measured by menstrual bleeding pattern. In prospectively
collected bleeding data, the majority of young women experience some duration of amenorrhea after chemotherapy
because of direct ablation of ovarian follicles.10,11 After chemotherapy, women who have residual ovarian follicles will
menstruate when follicular growth and ovulation resume, whereas women with depleted ovarian reserve will not resume
menstrual bleeding. Although return of menses is not equivalent to fertility, this event does identify the resumption of

ovulatory function that is necessary for fertility and important to adjuvant endocrine therapy decisions. However, measuring ovarian function according to the
bleeding pattern alone requires watchful waiting, thus
diagnosing the recovery of ovarian function only in
retrospect.
Age and cancer treatment regimens are consistently
associated with the resumption of menstrual bleeding in
cancer survivors, supporting the concept that posttreatment ovarian function is determined by both intrinsic factors, ie, ovarian reserve, and extrinsic exposures, ie,
toxicity of treatment.11,12 In addition to age, endocrine
measures of ovarian reserve before cancer treatment may
aid in predicting ovarian function after treatment.
Expressed by granulosa cells in small growing follicles,
antimullerian hormone (AMH) levels decrease with
declining size of the follicle pool and are relatively stable
across the menstrual cycle.13,14 Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary increases with declining
ovarian reserve but varies within and across menstrual
cycles.15,16 Levels of inhibin B (inhB) from granulosa cells
decrease with declining ovarian reserve and fluctuate
across the menstrual cycle.15,16 These endocrine measures
are impacted by gonadotoxic cancer treatments, and several small studies have suggested an association between
prechemotherapy AMH and FSH levels and postchemotherapy ovarian function.7,17-22 However, data are lacking
on individualizing risk based on these biomarkers. Moreover, to our knowledge, no study to date has been
designed that can predict the timing of ovarian function
after chemotherapy to inform patients and providers
about the expected course of ovarian recovery and to contribute toward clinical decisions that depend on ovarian
function status.
The objectives of the current study were to examine
the association of prechemotherapy AMH, FSH, and
inhB levels with the timing of postchemotherapy ovarian
function in young women with breast cancer and to generate a prognostic score for ovarian recovery. We hypothesized that lower FSH levels and higher AMH and inhB
levels before chemotherapy would predict a shorter time
to ovarian recovery after chemotherapy, as measured by
menstrual pattern.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

A prospective cohort study was performed to determine
predictors of ovarian function in young breast cancer survivors. Participants were identified by systematic medical
3692

record screening of all new breast cancer patients from
breast clinics at the University of California-San Diego
and the University of Pennsylvania between 2009 and
2012. Patients were eligible if they were ages 18 to 45
years, diagnosed with early stage breast cancer (American
Joint Committee on Cancer stages I-III), had a uterus and
at least 1 ovary, and reported at least 1 menses over the
previous 12 months factors. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, use
of psychotropic drugs known to impact ovulation, and
history of prior cancer, chemotherapy, or pelvic radiation
were exclusion criteria. To test whether endocrine measures could predict the return of ovarian function after
chemotherapy, the analysis included participants who 1)
received chemotherapy and 2) subsequently experienced
secondary amenorrhea, defined as 3 months of amenorrhea with chemotherapy.23 All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the
institutional review boards at the University of CaliforniaSan Diego and the University of Pennsylvania. This study
is registered as a national clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov
identifier NCT01197456).
Study Procedures

Having enrolled before they received chemotherapy, participants completed daily bleeding calendars and underwent in-person follow-up visits in the breast clinic every 6
months, during which they completed a study questionnaire and blood draw. Because of urgency in starting
chemotherapy, enrollment blood specimens were drawn
across the menstrual cycle. Specimens were processed for
serum and were frozen at 280 C. Study questionnaires
were used to obtain demographics, breast cancer and medical history, and interval menstrual history.
Sera were assayed for AMH, FSH, inhB, and estradiol (E2) at the University of Southern California Reproductive Endocrine Research Laboratory. AMH was
measured using the AMH enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay kit, which has a limit of detectability of 0.17 ng/mL
(AMH Gen II assay; Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, Calif).
FSH was measured by direct immunochemiluminometric
assay using the automated Immulite system (Siemens
Medical Solutions, Los Angeles, Calif). E2 was measured
by radioimmunoassay after an organic solvent extraction
step and had a limit of detectability of 3 pg/mL. InhB
assays used a monoclonal, 2-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a limit of detectability of 9.4 pg/mL
(Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, Tex). Interassay coefficients of variation were <10% for all assays. Values below detection thresholds were given half of the
threshold value in analyses.

Statistical Analysis

Analyses were performed using the software packages
STATA (Release 12; Stata Corporation, College Station,
Tex) and SPSS (version 21.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).
The primary exposures of interest were prechemotherapy
AMH, FSH, and inhB levels. The primary outcome was
time to the return of ovarian function after chemotherapy,
which was measured from the end of chemotherapy (to
minimize the impact of varied chemotherapy durations)
to the first episode of vaginal bleeding. Time to return of
ovarian function was censored when the participant
underwent her last follow-up or for any of the following
events that occurred before the return of menses: start of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, cancer recurrence requiring further treatment, death, or study
withdrawal. Bleeding was determined using daily bleeding
calendars and was verified by study questionnaires and
primary medical records. Bleeding episodes related to procedures such as interuterine device insertion were
excluded.
Baseline characteristics were summarized as frequencies and proportions or as means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges, as appropriate. AMH, FSH, inhB, and
age were dichotomized according to median levels, as well
as by an FSH level of 10 IU/L and an AMH level of 1.0
ng/mL to indicate decreased ovarian reserve.24-26 Timeto-event methods were used. Kaplan-Meier survival curves
were generated, and the time to return of menses was
compared according to baseline characteristics using logrank tests. A Cox proportional-hazards regression model
was developed to examine predictors of return of ovarian
function and to control for confounding. All variables
with P<.05 based on the Wald test from univariate analysis and known potential confounders (body mass index
[BMI], race, chemotherapy regimen, and tamoxifen) were
included in the multivariable model.27,28 P values <.05 in
the multivariable model were considered significant. A
priori identified interactions of age by FSH and AMH
were evaluated; neither achieved statistical significance,
and they were not considered further. Sensitivity analyses
were performed by 1) changing the definition of return of
ovarian function to 2 episodes of vaginal bleeding
within 6 months after chemotherapy and 2) including
only women who were followed for at least 3 months after
chemotherapy.
Model simplification was undertaken to build a
scoring system for return of ovarian function. Further
categorization (quartiles, tertiles, medians, and clinical cutoff points for age, AMH, FSH, and BMI) of risk factors

from the final multivariable model was considered. The
final multivariable model and proposed simplifications
were compared using the Harrell C index to assure that the
scores had similar discrimination. We considered both
weighted scores, using estimates from the Cox model, and
unweighted scores. Bootstrap resampling methods were
used to further assessed model performance.29
A priori, we set the sample size at 120 for feasibility
and assumed that the proportion who had ovarian recovery would be 50%.3 By using standard deviations for hormone levels from women in this age range,15,20 the cohort
would be powered to detect differences of 0.15 ng/mL in
AMH, 0.62 mIU/mL in FSH, and 3.70 pg/mL in inhB in
prechemotherapy blood samples between participants
who recovered ovarian function and those who did not
(b5.80; a5.05).
RESULTS
In total, 124 participants received chemotherapy, of
whom 109 (88%) experienced at least 3 months of amenorrhea with chemotherapy and were included in this analysis. Among the participants who were excluded, 9 (8%)
never experienced amenorrhea, and 5 (4%) did not have
sufficient follow-up to determine amenorrhea status. The
median age of participants who never experienced amenorrhea was 37.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 35.241.5 years). Median AMH, FSH, and inhB levels were 1.0
ng/mL (IQR, 0.6-1.5 ng/mL), 3.3 IU/L (IQR, 2.3-4.1
IU/L) and 20 pg/mL (IQR, 10.9-30.5 pg/mL), respectively. These characteristics did not differ from those of
participants who were included in this analysis.
Table 1 depicts baseline characteristics of the 109
women who experienced at least 3 months of amenorrhea
with chemotherapy. Their median age was 39.5 years
(IQR, 36.4-42.9 years), and mean6standard deviation
BMI was 24.665.1 kg/m2. All participants were premenopausal before the start of chemotherapy, and 85.3%
of participants had >9 periods in the year before starting
chemotherapy. The median cycle day of blood draw was
day 14 (IQR, days 4-21). Most participants were diagnosed with ductal type breast cancer (90%) and received
cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy (83%). The
most common chemotherapy regimens included doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel (55%) and docetaxel/
cyclophosphamide (22%). Approximately half of participants (51.4%) received tamoxifen, and 1 participant
received an aromatase inhibitor. Prechemotherapy levels
of AMH, FSH, inhB, and E2 are provided in Table 2.
The median AMH level was 0.7 ng/mL (IQR, 0.3-1.6 ng/
mL). The median FSH level was 5.3 IU/L (IQR 3.6-8.3

Sixty-two participants (57%) reported return of
menses after a median follow-up of 163 days (range, 41009 days). Seventeen participants were censored, including 8 patients (7%) who underwent bilateral oophorectomy, 6 patients (5%) who started GnRH agonist
therapy, 1 patient (1%) who developed disease recurrence,
and 2 patients (2%) who died. On univariate analysis of
baseline covariates, younger age, higher AMH levels, and
lower FSH levels were associated with return of ovarian
function (Tables 1 and 2). InhB levels, cancer or treatment characteristics, and GnRH agonist cotreatment for

confidence interval, 1.3-16.8). In addition, participants
who were younger, overweight or obese, and white were
more likely to regain ovarian function. In sensitivity analyses, results were consistent whether we varied the outcome as 2 episodes of vaginal bleeding within 6 months
after chemotherapy or included only participants who had
at least 3 months of follow-up postchemotherapy.
An internal validation of the multivariable explanatory model was conducted using 1000 bootstrap samples
of size 109 to determine final variables for the return of
ovarian function. Only age, AMH, and BMI remained
significantly associated with return of ovarian function
from the bootstrap models. Two prognostic scores
(weighted and unweighted) were created and compared,
and 1 point was given per variable present. Score A

weighted the 3 variables equally (Score A5[age <40
years]1[AMH >0.7 ng/mL]1[BMI 25 kg/m2]),
whereas Score B used coefficient weights from the Cox
model (Score B53.3[age <40 years]12.9[AMH >0.7
ng/mL]12.7[BMI 25 kg/m2]). Bootstrap estimates of
the Harrell C index were similar for the 2 prognostic
scores (Score A, 0.70; Score B, 0.71). Hence, the
unweighted score A was used in Table 4 and in Figure 1 to
demonstrate differential times to return of ovarian function as a function of prognostic score.
DISCUSSION
In reproductive-aged women with newly diagnosed breast
cancer, prechemotherapy AMH and FSH levels were associated with the return of ovarian function after chemotherapy, independent of age. In the current study, we were
able to estimate the timing of resumption of menstrual
bleeding by using a novel prognostic score incorporating
AMH, age, and body size. These data support using prechemotherapy measures of ovarian reserve to prospectively counsel young women with breast cancer on future
ovarian function.
In our cohort of patients with breast cancer who
received cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy, the vast
majority of participants (88%) experienced secondary
amenorrhea once chemotherapy was initiated. This observation was expected and reflects an acute loss of ovarian
function from chemotherapy-induced ablation of ovarian
follicles. To determine whether and when ovarian function returns after chemotherapy exposure (through the
resumption of folliculogenesis, ovulation, and menstrual
bleeding), the outcome we used was the time to resuming
menses, because menstrual pattern remains the goldstandard measure of ovarian function.16 Over the followup period, half of participants (57%) had evidence of
ovarian recovery by resumption of menses. This rate is
consistent with the rates reported in 3 smaller
cohorts.7,19,22 In estimating the timing of ovarian

study generated novel data aimed to inform clinical decisions that depend on ovarian function status as well as
future research on characterizing the pattern(s) of ovarian
aging after cancer.
Prechemotherapy measures of ovarian reserve, specifically AMH and FSH, were associated with postchemotherapy ovarian recovery. These data confirm prior
observations in 4 small cohorts of breast cancer patients.
Anderson and colleagues reported that pretreatment
AMH levels were lower in 30 women who were amenorrheic at 2 years postchemotherapy compared with 9
women who continued to menstruate.6,9 In a second
cohort, prechemotherapy AMH and inhB levels were
lower in 16 women who remained amenorrheic for 12
months postchemotherapy compared with 5 women who
were menstruating.7 Similarly, a third cohort study of 27
patients followed for a median of 13 months recently
reported that detectable AMH levels (0.16 ng/mL), but

not FSH or inhB levels, before chemotherapy were associated with return of menses.22 The final cohort of 26
patients had nonstatistically significant lower AMH levels
and higher FSH levels among women who did not resume
menses 6 months after chemotherapy.19 Among the available studies, AMH was most consistently associated with
post-treatment menstrual pattern. The relations between
FSH or inhB levels and menstrual pattern were in the
expected directions but did not reliably demonstrate significant associations. We posit that this is potentially
because of sampling throughout the menstrual cycle in
most studies, which increases overall variability and limits
study power. In practice, early follicular-phase blood
draws are a challenge in newly diagnosed patients who are
starting chemotherapy. Therefore, pretreatment ovarian
reserve markers with significant intracycle variability may
have limited clinical utility for prediction.
In the current study, we developed a novel prognostic
score for ovarian recovery to shift the focus of studies on
ovarian reserve in young cancer patients from association
studies into clinical prediction. Without predictors, young
women with breast cancer undergo watchful waiting for
return of menses after chemotherapy, and the diagnoses of
ovarian recovery versus ovarian failure are made only in retrospect. Because of a relatively large sample size and close
follow-up of menstrual bleeding pattern (by diary and frequent verification in study visits), we were able to define
the outcome with more precision than prior studies. Moreover, our study was powered a priori to identify multiple
independent predictors of postchemotherapy ovarian function measured by bleeding pattern. In deriving cutoff
points for hormone levels, we tested medians, quartiles,
and clinically used cutoff levels for decreased ovarian
reserve and observed that median AMH (0.7 ng/mL) and
FSH (11 IU/L) cutoff points for decreased ovarian reserve
provided better discrimination. It is noteworthy that the
cutoff point of 0.7 ng/mL for AMH was identified empirically by 2 small cohorts. In the cohort reported by Anderson and Cameron,6 receiver-operating characteristic curve
analysis identified 0.7 ng/mL as the AMH cutoff point for
a peak likelihood ratio of 6 months of amenorrhea by 4 or
5 years postchemotherapy; those authors used the Beckman
Coulter active MIS/AMH kit, to which the Gen II assay in
the current study was standardized.30 Anders et al also identified a median AMH level of 0.7 ng/mL using the Diagnostic Systems Laboratories AMH assay, which uses the
same antibody pair as the Gen II assay.7 Similar to the multivariable logistic model used by Anderson and Cameron,
in our data set, FSH did not remain in the simplified prediction model after bootstrapping.

AMH Predicts Return of Ovarian Function/Su et al

Younger age and higher BMI were predictors of a
shorter time to return of menses. Age was expected, and
the cutoff age at 40 years is used clinically to dichotomize
participants in the chemotherapy-related amenorrhea literature. Quartiles of age did not improve prediction. Age
was additive to AMH, a finding also observed by Anderson and colleagues using a classification-tree approach.
To our knowledge, pretreatment body size has not been
associated with postchemotherapy ovarian function.
However, the Study of Women’s Health Across the
Nation recently reported that higher baseline weight was
associated with later age at the natural, final menstrual
period in a longitudinal study of 3200 women in the
United States, a finding also reported by several other
smaller studies on menopause in noncancer populations.28,31,32 Although the mechanism by which larger
body size would result in later ovarian senescence is not
clear, if confirmed in future studies, then body size may
be an additional intrinsic factor related to ovarian function after gonadotoxic therapy.
Cancer and treatment risk factors, including stage,
exposure to cyclophosphamide, dose-dense therapy, and
tamoxifen exposure, were not related to the timing of
ovarian recovery. This was expected and was considered a
strength of our study, because we recruited a relatively
homogeneous population to allow an examination of the
primary exposures of interest: endocrine measures of
ovarian reserve. The identification of AMH, in addition
to age, provides candidate predictors for future investigations on predicting ovarian function in more diverse cancer populations, in which efforts to classify the
gonadotoxicity of various treatment approaches are much
needed.
Several limitations are important to discuss. First,
post-treatment ovarian function was measured by return
of menses. We chose a menstrual bleeding outcome
because menstrual pattern is associated with endocrine
biomarkers, menopausal symptoms, and age at final menses.16,33-36 Although the presence of menses does not
equate to fertility, the return of menses does identify the
resumption of ovulatory function, which is necessary for
fertility and important in decisions regarding adjuvant endocrine therapy. By selecting the first bleeding episode as
the outcome, it is possible that women who had bleeding
for other reasons, eg atrophy, were misclassified. Hence,
we performed a sensitivity analysis in which we varied the
bleeding outcome definition and length of follow-up
postchemotherapy, which did not change the observed
associations. Moreover, misclassification would bias our
results toward the null. With further follow-up, the future
Cancer

goals of this cohort are to identify the end of the window
of ovarian function and to explore whether these endocrine markers predict fertility. We intentionally did not
select postchemotherapy ovarian reserve marker levels as
the outcome, because, to date, there are no longitudinal
studies linking these levels to clinical outcomes from pregnancy to menopause.
Second, prognostic models require validation.37
External validation is ideal but challenging, because longitudinal studies in this population are few and small, outcome data have not been collected in a consistent manner,
and multiple immunoassays for AMH have been used.
We approached this limitation by using internal validation and showed bootstrapping results that were robust.29
For ongoing and future studies, we propose careful collection of menstrual bleeding and biospecimens postchemotherapy to allow for future cross-validation and
characterization of stages of reproductive aging in populations exposed to gonadotoxic treatments.
Although study withdrawal and loss to follow-up
were minimal in our cohort, 12% of the population was
censored because of temporary or permanent ovarian
ablation by GnRH agonist or oophorectomy. A similar
loss of evaluable patients was observed in previously studies. Although sensitivity analysis omitting these patients
from the analysis did not change the overall findings, this
observation informs the need to inflate sample size in
future studies to account for attrition.
The ability to predict postchemotherapy ovarian
function is clinically important in young cancer survivors
because of its implications for fertility, menopause, choice
of endocrine therapy, and cancer prognosis. Prognostic
markers measured before cancer treatment that can provide prognostic information on post-treatment ovarian
function would change clinical management. Building on
cross-sectional and small longitudinal studies of endocrine
ovarian reserve markers in cancer survivors, the current
study identified a prediction rule for return of ovarian
function after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients
based on pretreatment AMH, age, and body size.
