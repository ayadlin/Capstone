ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) continues to be associated with a dismal
prognosis despite aggressive treatment. Significant efforts are being made to develop
new nanotechnology-based therapeutic and diagnostic agents. Nanoparticles can act
directly on cancer cells or as drug carriers to enhance the cancer therapeutic effect.
In this study, we investigated the effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on human
glioma U251 cells and its role in the combinational use with Temozolomide (TMZ),
an imidazotetrazine derivative of the alkylating agent dacarbazine, against glioma
cells. AgNPs were synthesized in the sodium citrate system and the mean size were
26 nm in diameter. The AgNP particles showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity on U251
cells. They also showed the ability to enhance the drug-sensitivity of TMZ on U251
cells. Our results revealed that AgNPs could have a potential application in enhancing
chemotherapy for glioma.

INTRODUCTION

There are many types of nanocarriers that have been
developed to deliver a variety of drugs. The most common
nanocarriers are polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid
nanoparticles and liposomes [6–8]. These nanocarriers
have shown excellent characteristics as drug delivery
system. They reduced non-specific cellular uptake,
prolonged the lifetime of drug in systemic circulation.
They can control drug release, improve drug targeting
ability. Nanocarriers can also be generated as, multidrug
encapsulation for treatments that require multi-regimen.
In recent years, a number of chemotherapeutic drugs
have been successfully encapsulated in nanoparticles for
cancer treatment. The average size of these nanoparticles
ranges from 50 to 150 nm. Studies have demonstrated the
strength of using nanoparticle delivery system to tackle
cancer drug resistance [5]. There are several clinical trials
are in progress using nanoparticle-encapsulated anticancer drugs. Some of the nanoparticle encapsulated anticancer drugs are currently available on the market.
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have showed the
property of anti-cancers. There were studies show that
AgNPs can enter cells by endocytosis [9]. Inside the

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the most
common malignant tumors in the central nervous system
(CNS), remains a lethal disease with poor prognosis. The
treatment of GBM is multimodality in which surgical
resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy play important
roles [1, 2]. Among them, chemotherapy remains the
gold standard for patients who can not tolerate surgical
procedure or relapse after surgery. However, most
glioma cancer eventually develops multidrug resistance
(MDR) to current chemotherapeutic drugs that limits the
effectiveness of treatment results [3, 4].
To circumvent the cancer drug resistance, strategies
have been focus on developing novel therapeutic agents and
enhancing cancer drug delivery efficacy. Direct delivery of
drug to the tumor site had been proposed and extensively
studied. In recent years, scientists were able to synthesize
nanoscale, biodegradable and biocompatible drug delivery
systems with the advanced nanotechnology. Such
accomplishment has made it possible to deliver anticancer
drugs using nanoparticles as delivery vehicles [5] .

Uptake of AgNPs by U251 cells

cells, AgNPs localize in the perinuclear region and endolysosomal membrane compartment [10]. Cytotoxicity
assay indicated that AgNPs has cytotoxicity whose
potency is similar to that of Ag ions [11]. Some researches
showed that AgNPs can enter the mitochondria and
affect cells’ respiration, generating reactive oxygen
species (ROS), therefore induced cell apoptosis [12–14].
Besides, AgNPs could cause DNA damage and induce
p53 protein expression [15]. Some studies also showed
that the function of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) could be affected by AgNPs [16]. These findings
confirmed that AgNPs had anti-tumor properties that
could be used as an alternative for cancer treatment and
for treating angiogenesis-related diseases [17].
Temozolomide (TMZ) is a second-generation
imidazotetrazine derivative, which exerts its cytotoxic
effects by methylation of specific DNA sites [19].
Although it is effective in the treatment of glioblastoma,
drug resistance limits its successful application. It was
known that AgNPs have differential sensitivity to normal
cells (e.g. human lung fibroblast cells), as compared to
cancer cells (e.g. human glioblastoma cells) [18]. In the
present study, we investigate the cytotoxicity of AgPNs
on glioma cells and explore whether AgNPs can enhance
the sensitivity of TMZ against glioma. We demonstrated
that the combination of AgNPs and TMZ has potent antiglioma effect and could be explored to developing into
novel chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment.

TEM micrographs show that AgNPs distributed
inside the cells. AgNPs containing endosomes were
mainly seen near the cell membrane. This result indicated
that AgNPs might enter the cells through membrane
endocytosis. In addition to the nanoparticles-containing
endosomes, autophagic cellular vacuoles filled with
structures resembling mitochondria and electron dense
contents of unknown origin were also observed inside the
AgNPs treated cells. A few nanoparticles were seen in the
nucleus of the treated cells. (Figure 2).

Colony formation assay
U251 cells form colony upon culture in Petri dishes.
Under the treatment with AgNPs at the concentration of
46 μmol/L, the cells’ colony forming ability decreased to
around 80% compared to cells without AgNPs treatment.
Similarly, TMZ treatment repressed U251 cells’ colony
forming ability. Treatment of U251 cells with the
combination of TMZ and AgNPs, the number of survival
colonies significantly decreased (Figure 3). This result
indicated that AgNPs could enhance the effect of TMZinduced cell death.

AgNPs induced cell apoptosis and significantly
enhanced TMZ sensitivity in inducing cell
apoptosis

RESULTS

The above results showed that TMZ combined
with AgNPs significantly decrease the cell survival
rate. To understand whether the decreased cell survival
was associated with apoptosis, PI and Annexin-VFITC staining was performed and analyzed using flow
cytometry. U251 cells were treated with AgNPs, TMZ
or combination of both. The results showed although
AgNPs or TMZ alone can increase cell apoptosis to certain
degree. The apoptosis rate increased much more in cells
treated by the combination of AgNPs and TMZ (P < 0.05)
(Figure 4). These results demonstrated that combination of
AgNPs and TMZ further induce apoptosis in cancer cells.

Characteristics of AgNPs
AgNPs were prepared from the sodium citrate
system by using AgNO3 and NaBH4. Under transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), AgNPs was found to be
heterogeneous spheres with a diameter ranging from
21–32 nm. They were uniformly distributed. The mean
diameter of AgNPs was 26 nm (Figure 1).

Cytotoxicity of AgNPs

AgNPs induced cell cycle arrest and significantly
enhanced TMZ sensitivity in inducing cell cycle
arrest

Our previous studies showed that AgNPs have a
definite dose-dependent toxicity on cells. We usually
regard 1/5 of IC50 as a suitable concentration, because
of better biocompatibility and little toxic effect on
normal cells. In the preliminary experiments, U251 cells
were incubated with different concentrations of AgNPs.
We found necrotic and apoptotic cells when AgNPs
concentration was greater than 92 μmol/L. Most of the
cells grow normally when the AgNPs concentration
was less than 46 μmol/L, the 1/5 of IC50 of AgNPs.
Therefore 46 μmol/L of AgNPs was used in the following
experiments.

Analysis of the cell cycle showed that both
AgNPs and TMZ alone could induce G2/M arrest. The
combinational use of AgNPs with TMZ further induce
G2/M arrest (Figure 5). This result indicated that AgNPs
can induce cell cycle arrest and enhance the sensitivity of
TMA in inducing cell cycle arrest. This result might also
explain why more cells could enter apoptosis phase after
incubated with AgNPs.

DISCUSSION

AgNPs has been used as a radiosensitizer in the treatment
of glioma [25].
In this study, experiments were carried out to study
the cytotoxic effect of AgNPs on human glioma cells.
Factors that affect the cytotoxicity of AgNPs include the
shape and size of particles, the surface charge and capping
agent. We found that AgNPs with the size of diameter
around 26 nm can be uptake into cells and released as silver
ions, which interfered with the intracellular repair process.
Our results indicated that AgNPs have high cytotoxicity
against glioma cells at a very low concentration

It was know that AgNPs can induce dose-dependent
cytotoxicities that include DNA damage and oxidative
stress that can result in cell death. Gliomas are sensitive
to agents that cause DNA damage and oxidative stress.
AgNPs have differential sensitivity to normal cells (e.g.
human lung fibroblast cells), as compared to cancer cells
(e.g. human glioblastoma cells) [18]. Studies have shown
the cytotoxic effect of AgNPs on a variety of cancer cells,
e.g. glioblastoma cells and breast cancer cells [21–25].

(46 μmol/L) that have little effect on normal cells. AgNPs
induced DNA damage and apoptosis. The cytotoxic effect
of AgNPs was concentration-dependent and was enforced
when combined use with chemotherapeutic agent TMZ.
As one of the most common and lethal primary
malignant tumors in the central nervous system, the prognosis

of GBM is very poor. Current regimes for GBM include
surgical resection and aggressive treatment with radiotherapy
and chemotherapy. Although progress has been made, the
results are still not satisfying. In recent years, significant
efforts are devoted in the development of nanotechnologybased therapeutic agents. The present study provides a

rational for using AgNPs to develop into therapeutic agents
for GBM. In summary, our studies show that AgNPs have
selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells, particularly on
glioma cells at doses that are nontoxic to normal cells. It
has a dose-enhancement effect in the combinational use with
TMZ. These results implicated the potential use of AgNPs as
a therapeutic agent for GMB therapy.

The prepared AgNPs was centrifuged and the
supernatant was discarded. AgNPs were then dispersed
into Fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma Corp. Ltd,
Shenzhen, China ) and transferred into Dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma Corp. Ltd)
(FBS: DMEM = 1:9). The samples received 20 Gy
dose of X-rays irritation for sterilization. The prepared
AgNPs were examined by transmission electron
microscope (TEM, JEM-2010, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
AgNPs synthesis

Cell culture

AgNPs was synthesized according to published
protocol. Briefly, 0.1 M AgNO3 (0.5 mL) was added
into 40 mL deionized water, and then mixed with freshly
prepared 0.02 M NaBH4 (1 mL) aqueous solution with
vigorous stirring. A solution of 1% sodium citrate (10 mL)
was added during the reduction. The solution was allowed
to stir for an additional 30 sec [20].

The human glioma U251 cells were supplied
by Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology and cells were
maintained in presence of Glutamine and nonessential
amino acids (NEAA), supplemented with 10% FBS
(Sigma Corp. Ltd). Cell cultures were incubated at 37°C
and equilibrated in 5% CO2 and air.

MTT assay

V-FITC (1 μg/ml) and PI reagent (5 μg/ml) were added into
cell suspensions. Then the cells were incubated in the dark
for 15 min at room temperature and analyzed immediately
by flow cytometry (BD Sciences, San Diego, USA).

U251 cells were transferred into 96-well microplates at a density of 1 × 103 cell/well. At the end of 24 h
culture, cells were cultured with different concentrations
of TMZ or AgNPs for another 24 h. After that, the medium
was removed. Then 20 μl of 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenylterazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma)
(5 mg/L) was added to each well, and placed at 37oC for
4 h. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 150 μl ) was added to
each well to dissolve the dark blue crystal products.
Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm using
a multi-well spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA).

Cell cycle analysis
After incubated with AgNPs for 24 h, cells were
incubated with TMZ for 24 h. Then these cells were
harvested after treatment and were fixed in 70% ethanol
at 4oC for 24 h. Before analysis, cells were washed once
in PBS, digested with 500 U/mL RNase for at least
30 min at 37oC and then stained with PBS containing
50 μg/ml PI for 30 min. Analyses were performed with
a flow cytometer (BD Sciences). Cell Cycle distributions
were calculated on DNA plots by BD FACS Diva software
(Verity Software House).

Colony formation assay
The cells were seeded in 1 × 104 per well and
cultured in 60 mm Petri dishes at 37°C with 5% CO2 in
a humidified incubator (three replicates). Twenty-four
hours later, AgNPs were added into the medium and the
concentration of AgNPs was kept in (1/5 of IC50) μmol/L.
Cells were incubated with AgNPs for another 24 h. Then
cells were incubated with TMZ with a concentration of
31 μmol/L based on previous MTT assays for another
24 h. After that, cells were washed twice with PBS and
re-cultured in the medium containing 10% FBS for 14 d.
Colonies were fixed with methanol, treated with Giemsa
stain (Sigma Corp. Ltd), and counted using a microscopy.

Statistical analysis
Sigma plot was used for statistical analysis. Each
experiment was performed for at least 3 times. Statistical
differences between control and experimental groups were
calculated using Student’s t test. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
