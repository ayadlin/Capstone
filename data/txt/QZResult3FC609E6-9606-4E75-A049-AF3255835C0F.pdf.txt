Abstract
Catumaxomab (CatmAb), a trifunctional bispeciﬁc antibody directed against the epithelial cell adhesion
molecule (EpCAM) and the T-cell antigen CD3, is approved as intraperitoneal therapy for the treatment of
malignant ascites in patients with EpCAM-positive carcinomas. The immunomonitoring results of a phase II/III
study using CatmAb revealed a tumoricidal effect associated with reduced VEGF levels, CD69-expressing
T cells, and the release of T-helper cell (TH)-1 cytokines. We comprehensively dissected the immunomodulatory
effects of the CatmAb on the major subsets of malignant ascites-inﬁltrating leukocytes and the molecular
ﬁngerprint of tumor cell death. Herein we show that in the presence of EpCAM-positive tumor targets, CatmAb
markedly enhanced T-cell activation [CD69, CD107A (LAMP1), HLA-DR and PD-1(PDCD1) expression] and
stimulated inﬂammatory CD4þ TH1 and CD8þ TH1 to release IFN-g but failed to trigger TH17 cells. Engagement of
CD16-expressing cells caused upregulation of TRAIL (TNFSF10) and costimulatory CD40 and CD80 molecules.
CatmAb promoted tumor cell death associated with ATP release and strongly synergized with oxaliplatin for the
exposure of the three hallmarks of immunogenic cell death (calreticulin, HMGB1, and ATP). These ﬁndings
warrant validation as potential biomarkers of efﬁcacy of CatmAb. Cancer Res; 73(15); 4663–73. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The trifunctional bispeciﬁc monoclonal antibody catumaxomab (CatmAb) has two binding speciﬁcities directed
at epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM (through a
mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-2a] and CD3 (through a rat
IgG2b)]. With its Fc portion, the antibody has the potential
to engage accessory cells (through FcgRI, FcgRIIa, FcgRIII)
such as neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages,
monocytes, and dendritic cells (DC; ref. 1). This therapeutic
strategy is expected to promote an MHC-unrestricted pattern of killing, targeting EpCAM-positive tumor cells (most
tumors of gastrointestinal origin and in some carcinomas of
the genitourinary tract, i.e., about 90% of ascites causing
carcinoma; refs. 2, 3), sparing EpCAM-negative mesothelial
cells of the peritoneal cavity. In vitro studies showed that

cytokine release, perforin-dependent killing, antibodydependent cytolysis (ADCC), and activation of accessory
cells all acted in concert to eliminate tumor cells (4–6).
EpCAMþ tumors have a worse prognosis than their negative
counterparts, speciﬁcally in triple-negative and node-negative breast cancers (7, 8). In tumor spheroids, CatmAb
(alone or together with cisplatin) exerted regressions of
tumor volumes associated with massive immune inﬁltration
in an ADCC-dependent manner (9).
Pilot and phase I/II studies showed that intraperitoneal
administration of CatmAb reduced tumor cell accumulation
in ascitic ﬂuids in a sustained manner (10, 11). Next, an open
label, multicenter, randomized phase II/III trial in patients
with malignant ascites due to epithelial cancer compared the
effects of CatmAb with control paracentesis. Puncture-free
survival (the primary endpoint of the trial) was signiﬁcantly
higher in the CatmAb compared with the control group
(median, 46 vs. 11 days, HR: 0.25; ref. 12). Overall survival in
the pooled population showed a positive trend toward the
CatmAb group with signiﬁcant results in the subgroup of
gastric cancers (12). Treatment with CatmAb delayed the
deterioration of quality of life in patients with malignant
ascites (13). Moreover, ascites concentrations of VEGF and
CD133þEpCAMþ cancer stem cells signiﬁcantly dropped following CatmAb treatment, whereas 20% to 30% of CD4þ and
CD8þ T cells acquired CD69 expression (14).
Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive phenotypic analysis of the immune inﬁltrates and the tumor cell death
ﬁngerprint in ascitic ﬂuids incubated ex vivo with CatmAb.
Our ﬁndings indicate that CatmAb skews the T-cell cytokine

Ascites samples
Ascites cells taken at screening (immediately before the
study) were harvested by standard sample centrifugation or
Ficoll density centrifugation if erythrocytes were present to
eliminate the latter. The supernatant was frozen at 80 C
to evaluate the assessment of cytokines. Cells harvested from
samples at screening were stained for ﬂuorescence-activated
cell sorted (FACS) analysis with the antibody anti-CD45-A750
(Beckman Coulter), anti-Epcam-PE (CD326, Becton Dickinson), and Vivid Yellow (Molecular Probe) to assess viability.
Malignant ascitic ﬂuids were deﬁned as "positive" when
EpCAM-speciﬁc staining gating on viable CD45-negative cells
was detectable in ﬂow cytometry using the appropriate isotype
control antibodies. No precise threshold of positivity was
required.
Then, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (106 cells per well)
in complete RPMI medium (RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS, 2
mmol/L L-glutamine, 20 mmol/L Hepes, 1 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin),
and CatmAb was added (or not) at 10 ng/mL. The plates were
incubated in a 5% saturated CO2 atmosphere at 37 C for 18
hours.

PBMC or ascites-CatmAb coculture systems
Either cocultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) from healthy volunteers (n ¼ 5) and EpCAMþ tumor
cells (SKBR3; allogeneic system) or ascites cells from patients
with malignant ascites (autologous system) were incubated
in the presence of CatmAb at a concentration of 10 ng/mL
for 18 to 48 hours. Ascitic ﬂuids harvested from 12 patients
bearing EpCAMþ/- cancers were used (Table 1).
Analyses of T-cell activation and measurement of cytokine
release in cell culture supernatants were conducted. Subsequent analyses included investigation of cell death of EpCAMþ
tumor cells and evaluation of immunologic cell death (ICD)
markers (CRT, HMGB1, ATP).

(Beckman Coulter), CD123 (Becton Dickinson), and Vivid
Yellow (Molecular Probe).
After 30 minutes of incubation at 2 to 8 C, samples were
washed. Samples were analyzed in a FACS Cyan (Beckman
Coulter). FACS data were analyzed with FlowJo software
(TreeStar Inc).
Intracellular staining. After incubation for 18 hours, a
protein transport inhibitor (BD Golgi-stop, Becton Dickinson)
and CD107a-PE (Becton Dickinson) were added for 2 hours at
37 C.
Then membrane staining was conducted to identify T cells
and NK cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56), after which intracellular
staining was conducted using BD CytoFIX CytoPerm Kit
(Becton Dickinson) plus IFN-g -APC (Miltenyi) and -IL17AFITC (Biolegend).
Cytokines monitoring. The cytokines, IFN-g, interleukin
(IL)-2, IL-4, IL-13, TNF-a IL-6, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-12p40, and
IL-5 were quantiﬁed in cell-free supernatants from cocultures
after the end of the incubation period. The supernatants were
stored at 80 C until analysis. Cytokines were quantiﬁed by
cytometric bead array (FlowCytomix; eBioscience) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, 13 bead populations
with distinct spectral addresses and size precoated with cytokine-speciﬁc capture antibodies were mixed and incubated
with recombinant cytokine standards or test samples. In a
second round, a biotin-conjugated second antibody mixture
was added. Finally, streptavidin–phycoerythrin was added.
Acquisition was conducted by ﬂow cytometry Cyan, and
analysis of sample data was conducted with manufactured
software (FlowCytomix; eBioscience).
Tumor cytotoxicity assays and ICD markers
Tumor cells coincubated with PBMC or CatmAb alone were
used as controls. After incubation for 18 hours, cells were
analyzed on a FACS after membrane staining with CD45-Alexa
A750 (Beckman Coulter) and staining with 7AAD (Becton
Dickinson) for determination of cell viability, and Annexin
V-APC (Becton Dickinson) conjugated for analysis of
apoptosis.
Fluorescence detection of cell surface CRT. Cells (in 12well plates) were ﬁrst washed with calreticuline (CRT) buffer
(1 PBS, 3% albumin bovin serum, pH 7.4) and then incubated with membrane markers for 20 minutes at 4 C. After
two washes in CRT buffer, cells were incubated in rabbit
anti-CRT antibody (1:100, Abcam) in FACS buffer at 4 C for
30 minutes. Cells reacted with secondary anti-rabbit IgG
(HþL) Alexa ﬂuor 488-conjugates (Becton Dickinson; 1:100)
in CRT buffer at 4 C for 30 minutes and then were washed
twice with FACS buffer. Finally, cells were incubated for 15
minutes with 7AAD and Annexin V-APC in Annexin buffer.
Data analysis was conducted using a FACS Cyan (Beckman
Coulter).
HMGB1 and ATP dosages. HMGB1 in cell-free supernatant was detected using an ELISA kit (IBL International
GMBH), and ATP in cell-free supernatant was detected using

www.aacrjournals.org

a kit for ATP measurement (ENLITEN ATP Assay System
Bioluminescence from PROMEGA).

Results
CatmAb-mediated T-cell triggering
Ascitic ﬂuids harvested from 12 patients bearing EpCAMþ/
cancers (Table 1) were freshly incubated with CatmAb for 18
hours. The percentages of CD3þCD4þ and CD3þCD8þ T cells
among the CD45þ fraction of ascites cells remained stable,
35.8  25 and 40.3  19 for CD4þT cells with or without CatmAb,
respectively (Fig. 1A), and 20.5  11 and 19.9  11 for CD8þ T
cells with or without CATmAb, respectively (Fig. 2A) in EpCAMþ
malignant ascites. Both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells could degranulate (expressed CD107A) in the presence of CatmAb, only in
EpCAMþ ascites (Figs. 1B and 2B, left). Both CD4þ and CD8þ
T cells secreted IFN-g in the presence of CatmAb, only in EpCAMþ
ascites (Figs. 1B and 2B, middle). CatmAb failed to signiﬁcantly
stimulate T cells to produce IL-17 (Figs. 1B and 2B, right). All
T cells exhibited activation markers such as CD69, HLA-DR, and
PD-1 upon recognition of EpCAMþ tumors (Figs. 1C, 2C and D,
right) but failed to express TRAIL (Fig. 2D, left). It is noteworthy
that similar ﬁndings and also the production of IL-17 could
be obtained by coculturing EpCAMþ/ tumor cell lines with
PBMCs from healthy volunteers in the presence of CatmAb
(Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). CatmAb-induced T-cell activation signiﬁcantly increased the production of IFN-g, IL-17A,
IL-6, and IL-1b, hence contributing to a modulation of the
local microenvironment (Fig. 3A and B). CatmAb deviated the
natural TH2 inﬂammation by decreasing the concentrations of
IL-4 and IL-13 while augmenting the TH1 cytokines in most
patients (Fig. 3C, left and right).
Malignant ascites contained up to 5% (8.25  5) of CD3þ
CD4þFoxp3þ T cells among CD4þT cells (Fig. 4A) that could be
analyzed according to CD45RA (15). Most of these regulatory
T cells (Treg) became Foxp3high CD45RA CD73þ after exposure to CatmAb (Fig. 4B and C).
CatmAb activated local T cells and geared their polarization
toward an inﬂammatory TH1 pattern despite the presence of
ectoATPase-expressing Treg.
Engagement of CD16-expressing cells in malignant
ascites incubated with CatmAb
NK cells were not enriched following CatmAb treatment
(Fig. 5A, left). Most NK cells from ascites TILs were CD16þ at
harvesting, but CatmAb did not signiﬁcantly reduce CD16
expression on NK cells (Fig. 5A, right). However, NK cells were
markedly activated by CatmAb, as shown by their upregulated
levels of CD69 and TRAIL expression (Fig. 5B, left and middle,
and, to a lesser extent NKp44 expression, right) only in
EpCAMþ ascites. Similar ﬁndings were achieved in cocultures
of PBMC and allogeneic EpCAMþ tumor cells modulated by
CatmAb (Supplementary Fig. S3) in that NK cells became
CD69þ TRAILþ while expressing low levels of CD107A and
IFN-g in the presence of the trifunctional Ab.
Most monocytes, albeit underrepresented in TILs (Fig. 5C,
left), also expressed CD16 molecules (Fig. 5C, right), which
upon engagement with CatmAb, decreased to some extent
(Fig. 5C, right). CatmAb markedly increased CD80 and CD40

right) while maintaining HLA-DR expression (Fig. 5D, middle).
Hence, CatmAb induced TRAIL expression on NK cells and
costimulatory molecules on inﬂammatory monocytes.
Tumor cell death ﬁngerprint post-CatmAb
Immunogenic cell death can be deﬁned as a modality of cell
demise associated with T-cell–dependent tumor rejection and
long-term survival, and correlated with the exposure or release
of cell death-associated molecular (CDAM) patterns (16).
Brieﬂy, stress before death matters for an immunogenic cell
death pathway to occur. First, an endoplasmic reticulum stress
response culminating with CRT exposure to the tumor cell
surface (17), then late apoptosis associated with the exodus of
the chromatin-binding HMGB1 protein (18), and ﬁnally, activation of the autophagy machinery leading to ATP release (19),
all contribute to the adequate phagocytosis, processing, and
antigen presentation of the dying tumor cells to T lymphocytes
(20, 21). Therefore, we addressed whether CatmAb-mediated
tumor cell death could trigger an immunogenic cell death

program. We analyzed by ﬂow cytometry the expression of
Annexin V and 7AAD on EpCAMþ CD45 tumor cells of the
malignant ascites in the presence (or absence) of CatmAb at 18
hours. The bispeciﬁc mAb increased the fraction of dying and
dead cells (Fig. 6A) and promoted the release of ATP in the
milieu (Fig. 6B, right) but failed to induce the exposure of CRT
or the exodus of HMGB1 in the extracellular environment of
ascites (n ¼ 10; Fig. 6B, left and middle). In contrast, preincubation of tumor cells (SKBR3) with oxaliplatin did not increase
cell death by CatmAb (Fig. 6C, left) but mediated stress and
increased CRT exposure (Fig. 6C, right) and HMGB1 (Fig. 6D,
left) and ATP release (Fig. 6D, right) in the presence of CatmAb.
CatmAb-mediated immunomodulatory effects on malignant ascites synergized with oxaliplatin to induce CDAM on
tumor cells.

Discussion
Here, we show, using malignant ascites ex vivo experimental
model systems, that CatmAb switches the polarization of local
T cells into inﬂammatory TH1 cells (capable of degranulating

(for NK cells) and costimulatory molecules (for monocytes). In
conjunction with oxaliplatin, CatmAb triggered the 3 hallmark
criteria of immunogenic cell death in allogeneic tumor cell
lines cocultured with PBMC.
CatmAb has been described as a trifunctional antibody
capable of (i) engaging T cells in a MHC-independent manner,
(ii) targeting tumor cells in an EpCAM-dependent fashion, and
(iii) stimulating antigen-presenting cells through the FcgR. The
increase rate of CD4þ T cells showing surface mobilization of

CD107a was unsuspected because surface mobilization of
CD107a by CD8þ T cells means that they can release cytotoxic
granules, a function not often associated with CD4þ T cells.
Although mostly described for cytolytic CTLs recognizing
target cells, membrane expression of CD107a, a lysosomal
marker associated with degranulation in CTLs, could also be
found on activated CD4þ T cells during viral infections. In such
circumstances, CD4þ T cells can acquire cytotoxic functions
resulting in the surface expression of CD107a and the release
of granzyme A and granzyme B (22–25).

concentrations after fresh harvesting (before incubation with CatmAb) of malignant ascetic ﬂuids using commercial Flow Cyto Mix (eBioscience). Ten various
malignant ascites samples were tested. Student t test to compare mean  SEM was used:  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01.

Although it is widely shown that CatmAb has local antitumor effects in malignant ascites (13) and mediates a strong
tumoricidal activity in mixed tumor lymphocyte cocultures (5–
7), whether CatmAb mediates distant effects on systemic
immunity remains an open conundrum. Interestingly, 2 case
reports suggested that a systemic immunity might take
place post-CatmAb. An extraperitoneal skin metastasis of a
platinum-refractory ovarian cancer regressed after an intraperitoneal treatment with CatmAb given for a massive ascites
(26). Delayed inﬂammatory lesions of the peritoneum corresponding to mesenterial nodular ﬁbrosis and granulomatosis
were observed postchemotherapy and surgery in adjuvant
intraperitoneal CatmAb injections and seemed to be associated with a complete and long-term response in an advanced
gastric adenocarcinoma (27). Str€
oehlein and colleagues
showed tumor-reactive CD4þ/CD8þ TH1/Tc1-lymphocytes in
PBMC after restimulation in 5 of 9 patients suffering from
peritoneal carcinomatosis, indicating that a long-term speciﬁc
antitumor immunity can be elicited with CatmAb (28). Finally,
humoral responses to CatmAb (human anti-mouse antibodies)
correlated with clinical outcome (puncture-free survival, time

4668

Cancer Res; 73(15) August 1, 2013

to next puncture, and overall survival) in a phase II/III clinical
trial (29). Several mechanisms could be involved to account for
this systemic immunity. The FcgR-mediated cross-presentation of dying cells is an efﬁcient pathway for the priming
of na€ve T cells (30). Alternatively, reactivation of tumorspeciﬁc effector T cells into long-lived cells integrating the
memory T-cell pool and recirculating to protect the host
against relapse independently of a de novo priming in lymph
nodes has been suggested or described (31–33). Finally, the
nature of tumor cell stress preceding cell demise matters to
condition long-term immunity against dying cells. The endoplasmic reticulum stress response culminating in the exposure,
to the cell surface, of an endoplasmic reticulum-resident
chaperone, CRT represents an "eat-me signal" for engulfment
of tumor cells by inﬂammatory phagocytes (17, 34).
Although CatmAb alone failed to promote CRT exposure on
most malignant ascites-derived tumor cells (and in vitro in
mixed lymphocyte tumor cocultures), it enhanced the ability of
oxaliplatin to induce it. On one hand, this negative result is
surprising given the fact that TRAIL-mediated lysis can promote CRT exposure on tumor cells (35). It may be explained by

the fact that TRAIL-expressing NK cells may not engage in
privileged contacts with dying tumor cells in the context of
the trifunctional bispeciﬁc antibody. On the other hand, Hoves
and colleagues showed that granzyme A/B-mediated lysis is
involved in enhancing uptake and cross-presentation of dying
bodies by CD8aþ DC in mouse models (36). They showed that
blocking phosphadidylserine did not hamper this granzymedependent engulfment of dying tumor cells. It is conceivable
that additional eat-me signals different from CRT be exposed
postdegranulation by T cells that could be recognized by the
human ortholog of mouse CD8aþ DC (37). However, very few
BDCA3þ DC could be recovered from ascitic ﬂuids in our
model system (data not shown). The lack of expression of CRT
does not seem to be related to a low effector to tumor cell ratio.
First, there was no signiﬁcant correlation between the E:T ratio
of CD45þ/EpCAMþ cells (ranging from 2–1,402; Table 1) and
T-cell activation parameters. Second, in a randomized trial (13)

www.aacrjournals.org

where the median proportion of EpCAMþ cells in ascites cells
was 0.6%, a clinical beneﬁt associated with a decreased percentage of EpCAMþ cells in ascites was reported.
CatmAb-mediated cell death could not promote the release of the nonhistone chromatin-binding transcription factor, HMGB1, in tumor cells from malignant ascites treated
with the bispeciﬁc antibody alone but could do so, in mixed
lymphocyte tumor allogeneic cocultures after presensitization
with oxaliplatin (Fig. 6D). This negative result could be
explained by the frequent deﬁciency in nuclear HMGB1
observed in advanced cancers (our unpublished data). Indeed,
HMGB1 is the ligand for TLR4-mediating efﬁcient processing
and presentation of the phagocytic cargo in DC to Tc1 cells
(18). The speciﬁc knockdown of HMGB1 (created by means of
siRNA interfering with HMGB1 translation in tumor cells)
suppressed the immunogenicity of cell death induced by
oxaliplatin in vivo (18). Therefore, it is conceivable that CatmAb

may not mediate its full potential in peritoneal carcinomatosis
exhibiting HMGB1 deﬁciencies. Interestingly, when combined
with oxaliplatin, CatmAb was more potent in promoting
HMGB1 release, urging the use of combinatorial regimen to
exploit the immunogenicity of the cell death process.
Finally, ATP release, associated with the activation of the
autophagy machinery in tumor cells (19, 38), is critical for 2 key
events: ﬁrst, the recruitment of CD11cþ DC in tumor beds
postchemotherapy or cell demise (26), second the engagement

of P2RX7 on DC, which activates the inﬂammasome NLRP3,
culminating in IL-1b release and IL-1R1–dependent Tc1 polarization (39). Ecto-ATPases expressed on regulatory TH17 (40)
and Tregs (41) might impair the recruitment of DC and/or
the differentiation of IFN-g producing CTLs posttreatment.
Indeed, CatmAb-treated malignant ascites contained increased levels of memory Treg expressing CD73 (Fig. 4). However,
such Tregs did not seem to inhibit the strong polarization
of TILs toward an inﬂammatory TH1 proﬁle (TNF-a, IFN-g,

will be conducted in France. We will validate the capacity of
CatmAb (i) to induce immunogenic cell stress or death in
peritoneal cancer cells, (ii) to switch the polarization of TIL
