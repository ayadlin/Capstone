ABSTRACT:

Progress in the understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of human
cancer, including human leukemia and lymphomas, has been spurred by cloning
of fusion genes created by chromosomal translocations or by retroviral insertional
mutagenesis; a number of oncogenes and tumor suppressors involved in development
of a number of malignancies have been identified in this manner. The BCR-ABL fusion
gene, originating in a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell, is the molecular signature
of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Discovery of this fusion gene has led to the
development of one of the first successful targeted molecular therapies for cancer
(Imatinib). It illustrates the advances that can result from an understanding of the
molecular basis of disease. However, there still remain many as yet unidentified
mutations that may influence the initiation or progression of human diseases. Thus,
identification and characterization of the mechanism of action of genes that contribute
to human diseases is an important and opportune area of current research. One
promising candidate as a potential therapeutic target is Abelson helper integration
site-1(Ahi-1/AHI-1) that was identified by retroviral insertional mutagenesis in
murine models of leukemia/lymphomas and is highly elevated in certain human
lymphoma and leukemia stem/progenitor cells. It encodes a unique protein with a SH3
domain, multiple SH3 binding sites and a WD40-repeat domain, suggesting that the
normal protein has novel signaling activities. A new AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 interaction
complex has recently been identified and this complex regulates transforming
activities and drug resistance in CML stem/progenitor cells. Importantly, AHI-1
has recently been identified as a susceptibility gene involved in a number of brain
disorders, including Joubert syndrome. Therefore, understanding molecular functions
of the AHI-1 gene could lead to important and novel insights into disease processes
involved in specific types of diseases. Ultimately, this knowledge will set the stage
for translation into new and more effective diagnostic and treatment strategies.

INTRODUCTION

fusion gene, associated with the development of chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) [1-6], is the prototype of such
a discovery and has ultimately led to the development of
one of the first targeted molecular therapies in cancer [4].
The revolution in the treatment of CML patients that has
resulted from the specific and potent targeting of the BCRABL kinase with STI571/Gleevec/Imatinib Mesylate [810] serves as an important reminder of the advances that

Remarkable progress has been made in the last decade
in the identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressors
that are causative to the development of cancer. Many
of these discoveries resulted from the cloning of fusion
genes created by translocations that are characteristic of
human leukemia and lymphomas [1-7]. The BCR-ABL

can come from an understanding of the molecular basis
of disease. Retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens
have been another powerful and complementary strategy
in cancer gene discovery; a number of oncogenes and
tumor suppressors that play crucial roles in development
of human cancer and leukemia have been identified in
this manner [11-15]. Recently, using retroviral-mediated
insertional mutagenesis to identify genes that collaborate
with oncogenes and tumor suppressors of the Myc, p53,
RB, Ras and ABL pathways have resulted in a number of
new targets for development of novel cancer therapeutics
[13]. Nevertheless, specific molecular causes of many
cancers remain unknown, along with the mutations
responsible for a large proportion of human cancers. There
is growing evidence that leukemogenesis, like the genesis
of other malignancies, is a multi-step process requiring the
accumulation of several mutations for the development of
overt disease. Therefore, continued identification of new
genes and characterization of the molecular basis of their
transforming activity is critical to the future development
of targeted cancer therapies that will be less toxic and
more effective.
Ahi-1 (Abelson helper integration site 1) is a novel
oncogene commonly activated by provirus insertional
mutagenesis in v-abl and myc-induced murine leukemias
and lymphomas [16]. It encodes a unique protein with a
SH3 domain, multiple SH3 binding sites and a WD40repeat domain, suggesting that the normal protein
has novel signaling activities. Ahi-1/AHI-1 transcript
levels are normally down-regulated during both early
murine and human hematopoietic cell differentiation

and are highly deregulated in certain human leukemic
cells, including leukemic stem cells from patients with
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and leukemic Sezary
cells in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) [17, 18].
Interestingly, overexpression of Ahi-1 alone in primitive
hematopoietic cells confers a proliferative advantage in
vitro and induces a lethal leukemia in vivo; these effects
can be enhanced by BCR-ABL, a fusion oncoprotein that
plays a major role in the genesis of CML [19]. Importantly,
a novel AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 interaction complex has
recently been identified in CML cells, mediating these
effects and playing a key role in mediation of tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) response/resistance of primary
CML stem/progenitor cells. These findings suggest that
AHI-1 could be a potential new therapeutic target in
CML stem cells, a population highly resistant to current
TKI therapy and thus causing disease relapse. Moreover,
mutations in AHI-1 have also been associated with Joubert
syndrome, an autosomal recessive brain disorder [20-22].
Abnormal development and axonal decussation occur in
individuals with point mutations in AHI-1, particularly
within the WD40-repeat and SH3 domains [22]. Ahi1 can also interact with Huntingtin-associated protein
1 (Hap1) to form a stable complex critical for neonatal
development and involved in intracellular trafficking
[23]. In addition, AHI-1 isoforms and its mutations also
underlie other diseases, including Joubert syndromeassociated nephronophthisis and autism, and metabolic
syndromes, including type 2 diabetes [18, 19, 22, 24-27].
Therefore, it is likely that AHI-1 mutations are critical in
the development of diseases such as Joubert syndrome

and specific types of human leukemia. Here we provide an
extensive review of the molecular and cellular functions
of AHI-1 and its interacting proteins in the regulation of
normal and disease development since its identification as
a cooperative oncogene in v-abl-induced murine leukemia
in 2002 [16]. Also discussed are potential applications
of targeting specific AHI-1 interaction complexes as a
new therapeutic strategy for treatment of CML and brain
disorders.

is responsible for its transforming potential [29-33] in
murine models of leukemia and lymphomas. A-MuLV
requires a non-defective helper MuLV virus to be able
to replicate both in vitro and in vivo [34]. It was shown
that the expression of v-abl is not sufficient to induce full
malignant transformation in several mouse strains and
that additional genetic events may be required [35, 36].
Using long-range restriction mapping, the Ahi-1 locus
was mapped to a position ~35 kb downstream of the
c-myb proto-oncogene on mouse chromosome 10 (Figure
1) [37]. Another MuLV provirus integration site (Mis-2)
was also mapped to the same region, 160 kb downstream
of c-myb and ~120 kb downstream of Ahi-1 [38]. It was
observed that enhanced expression of c-myb in A-MuLVinduced pre-B-lymphomas harboring a provirus inserted
within the Ahi-1 locus was not seen [37], suggesting that
the locus contained another gene (potentially Ahi-1 gene)
whose dysregulation might be involved in regulation of
the malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells. In
addition, the Ahi-1 locus was also the target of provirus
insertional mutagenesis in 14% of the c-myc-induced
murine T cell leukemia (Figure 1) [39], 5% of the Moloney
MuLV-induced rat thymomas [38], 11% of the Hoxa9/

mice [41]. These findings suggest that the Ahi-1 locus is
the target of provirus insertional mutagenesis and that its
deregulation may contribute to multiple types of murine
leukemia and lymphomas.
Subsequently, a new gene (Ahi-1) at the site targeted
by the provirus insertional mutations within the Ahi-1
locus was then identified using an exon trapping method
[16]. Most of the proviral insertions were localized to
the 3’ end of the Ahi-1 gene in an inverse transcriptional
orientation, primarily near and downstream of the last
exon, although some were found within various introns
(Figure 1). Cloning of the Ahi-1 cDNA showed that
it encodes a 1047 amino acid protein with a number of
interesting domains characteristic of a novel signaling
protein.

protein. Moreover, the human AHI-1 contains a coiledcoil domain in its N-terminal region, also involved in
protein-protein interactions [55], which is entirely absent
in the mouse and rat Ahi-1 proteins (Figure 2) [16]. Thus
Ahi-1 has multiple features of a unique adaptor protein
regulating specific signaling pathways.

Ahi-1/AHI-1 expression in
development and hematopoiesis

brain

Murine Ahi-1 encodes two major RNA species (5.0
and 4.2 kb) and several shorter splice variants [16]. Both
mouse and human Ahi-1/AHI-1 are highly expressed in
brain and testis and have lower expression in liver, lung,
thymus, kidney and pancreas [16, 56]. We and others
have recently demonstrated that Ahi-1 transcripts are
expressed at all stages of mouse embryo development,
with increasing expression just prior to birth, suggesting
that Ahi-1 expression is developmentally regulated [16,
21, 56]. Mouse Ahi-1 mRNA in the cerebellum has its
highest expression at E18 and P5, whereas expression in
the cerebral cortex appears maximally at E16 and E18
[21]. However, the expression of mouse Ahi-1 protein
in the cerebellum is very low and is only restricted to
Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei [56, 57]. Moreover,
in adult human brain tissue, the highest expression of
AHI-1 at both RNA and protein levels has been detected
in cerebellum and cerebral cortex [20, 56]. The different
cerebellum expression of Ahi-1/AHI-1 in mouse and
human may be due to the additional coiled-coil domain
present in the human AHI-1 [56]. In addition, Ahi-1
is also found to be abundant in the hypothalamus and
amygdala, two important brain region whose dysfunction
can lead to emotional and depression phenotypes [57, 58].
Interestingly, it has recently been reported that impaired
Wnt-beta-catenin signaling that disrupts renal homeostasis
leads to cystic kidney ciliopathy, as demonstrated in Ahi-1
conditional mutant mice [59]. Ahi-1 deficiency can also
cause defective Wnt-dependent cerebellar midline fusion
that is critical for the development of Joubert syndrome
[60]. In addition, Ahi-1 is reported to directly interact
with Hap1, a huntingtin-associated protein involved
in intracellular trafficking, to regulate cerebellar and
brainstem development [57]. It is known that some of
these proteins play important roles in regulation of stem
cell functions. These results suggest that Ahi-1/AHI-1
interacts with multiple signaling proteins and plays an
important role in regulating normal brain functions by
interacting with molecular partners in tissue- and diseasespecific manners.
It has been shown that expression of Ahi-1/AHI1 is regulated at multiple stages of hematopoiesis in
a highly conserved fashion in mice and humans [17].
Ahi-1/AHI-1 is expressed at its highest level in the most
primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and is rapidly

The structure of Ahi-1/AHI-1 protein
The AHI-1/Ahi-1 gene covers more than 200 kb
in a region of human chromosome 6 and a minimum of
100 kb on mouse chromosome 10 (Figure 1). Mouse and
human Ahi-1/AHI-1 contain at least 27 and 33 exons,
respectively [16]. The 1.3 kb region upstream of the ATG
start codon of human AHI-1 shows baseline promoter
activity and contains two putative TATA boxes and
several transcription factor binding sites, such as Oct-1
and c-fos [42]. The Ahi-1/AHI-1 gene is highly conserved
in mammals and encodes a unique protein with a Src
homology 3 (SH3) domain, multiple SH3 binding sites and
multiple WD40-repeats, all known mediators of proteinprotein interaction (Figure 2) [16, 43-46]. SH3 domains
are often found in proteins containing SH2 domains and
are known to bind to proline-rich motifs and to mediate
specific protein-protein interactions [43, 44, 47]. The
WD40-repeat domain was first identified in the β-subunits
of G-proteins [45]. A large number of WD40-repeatcontaining proteins have been identified and are known to
be involved in aspects of cellular metabolism, including
assembling and remodeling of chromosomal proteins
[45, 46, 48-51] and regulating the mRNA processing
body, including mRNA degradation. They have also been
implicated in several inherited diseases, such as Cockayne
syndrome, Triple-A syndrome and lissencephaly [51].
Interestingly, the Ahi-1/AHI-1 protein is the only protein
thus far identified to contain both WD40 repeats and a
SH3 domain. The SH3-binding sites were initially found
to bind specifically to the SH3 domain of ABL [52]; many
SH3 domain interacting proteins have been characterized
as regulators of protein-protein interactions involved
in signal transduction, cell cycle control and malignant
transformation [43, 44, 46, 47]. Ahi-1/AHI-1 also harbors
two potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, one within
the SH3 domain. Phosphotyrosine motifs are known
to bind specifically to SH2 domains of proteins [46]. In
addition, several PEST sequences, known to mediate
protein degradation [53, 54], are located in Ahi-1/AHI-1

and SH3 [22]. Altered AHI-1 isoforms and its mutations
also underline other diseases, including Joubert syndromeassociated nephronophthisis and autism, and metabolic
syndromes [18, 19, 22, 24-27]. Therefore, it is very likely
that truncated forms of AHI-1 are critical in development
of diseases such as Joubert syndrome and specific types of
human leukemia.

down-regulated as cells differentiate. Interestingly, RNA
expression of the mouse Ahi-1 gene is 5-fold higher in
the mouse hematopoietic stem cell-enriched population
(Sca-1+lin-) purified from normal adult bone marrow
(BM) compared to the more differentiated hematopoietic
cells (lin+). In addition, within the different lineages of
differentiated lin+ cells, Ahi-1 transcript levels are 6- to
7-fold lower in the granulocyte/macrophage lineage
compared with the T-lymphoid, erythroid and B-lymphoid
lineages [17]. A similar pattern of down-regulated human
AHI-1 transcript levels during normal hematopoietic cell
differentiation has also been observed in normal adult
human BM cells, with an overall 6-fold decrease from
the most primitive lin-CD34+CD38- subset to the most
mature lin+ CD34- cells. In addition, similar to mouse,
human lin+ BM cells from the granulocyte lineage showed
significantly reduced expression of AHI-1 compared to T,
B and erythroid cell lineages [17]. The conserved pattern
of changes in Ahi-1/AHI-1 expression between mice and
humans during multi-step hematopoietic cell differentiation
suggests that Ahi-1/AHI-1 may play important roles in the
regulation of the normal hematopoietic stem cell-renewal
program and downstream cell differentiation events.	

BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF AHI-1 IN
HUMAN T-CELL LYMPHOMAS
Deregulated expression of AHI-1 in human
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells
The first evidence that AHI-1 may be involved in the
regulation of human leukemia and lymphoma development
is based on an interesting observation that AHI-1 transcripts
are significantly higher in a broad spectrum of established
human leukemic and lymphoid cell lines, compared to
normal human BM. The highest expression level is in two
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cell lines, Hut78,
derived from a blood sample of a patient with Sezary
Syndrome (SS), and Hut102, derived from the blood of a
patient with mycosis fungoides (MF), where increases in
AHI-1 transcripts of 40-fold have been detected compared
to normal BM [17]. CTCL is a heterogeneous group of
T-cell lymphomas that are characterized by malignant
T-cells that infiltrate the skin. SS and MF are two major
subtypes of CTCL which together account for more than
70% of all CTCL cases [61-64]. SS is the leukemic form of
CTCL and is characterized by erythroderma, generalized
lymphadenopathy and the presence of malignant mature
memory T-helper cells (CD4+CD7-CD45RO+), called
Sezary cells, in the skin, lymph nodes and peripheral blood
[64-66]. AHI-1 is expressed at significantly higher levels
at both RNA and protein levels in primary Sezary cells
(CD4+CD7-) from patients with SS compared to normal
CD4+ T-cells from normal controls [18, 24]. Particularly,
AHI-1 isoform II, lacking the SH3 domain, shows the
highest expression in SS samples compared to controls
[18, 24]. Little is known about the molecular pathways
involved in the development of CTCL; however, the
marked deregulation of AHI-1 in CTCL cell lines and
primary Sezary cells suggests a potential oncogenic role
for AHI-1 in this group of diseases.

Ahi-1/AHI-1 isoforms and mutations
Ahi-1/AHI-1 is subject to alternative splicing and
both murine and human Ahi-1/AHI-1 genes can encode
at least three isoforms (Figure 2). Notably, isoform II,
the shortest AHI-1 isoform, lacks the SH3 domain and
isoform III contains additional coding sequences not
present in isoform I or II [16]. Comparative genetic
analysis of the evolution of the human AHI-1 gene
indicates that it has undergone positive selection during
development of the human species [20]. Thus, changes in
AHI-1 are likely to have been important in the evolution of
human-specific characteristics; these may include features
of the mechanisms regulating early stages of normal
hematopoietic cell differentiation.
Involvement of Ahi-1 in mouse models of
leukemogenesis is suggested by the high frequency of
Ahi-1 mutations observed in certain virus-induced murine
lymphomas [16]. Gene-expression analyses of pre-B and
T-cell leukemic cells with insertional Ahi-1 mutations
has shown both increased expression of Ahi-1 and Ahi1/viral fused transcripts in the malignant cells, including
deletions of the SH3 domain in some cases [16]. Recently,
mutations in the human AHI-1 gene have been found to be
associated with Joubert syndrome, an autosomal recessive
brain disorder [20-22]. Abnormal cerebellar development
and axonal decussation were found in individuals with
point mutations in AHI-1. These mutations generate stop
codons, or amino acid substitutions, or splicing errors
within the AHI-1 protein. Truncating mutations are the
most frequent type (80%) that abolish completely, or
partially, two critical domains of AHI-1: WD40-repeat

Evidence of an oncogenic role of AHI-1 in CTCL
cells
To obtain direct evidence that deregulated expression
of AHI-1 contributes to the transformed properties of
human CTCL cells, knockdown of AHI-1 expression in
Hut78 cells was performed using retroviral-mediated

RNA interference (RNAi). A screen of nine constructs
that produce short hairpin AHI-1 transcripts yielded one
that specifically inhibited AHI-1 expression in transduced
Hut78 cells by 80%, as evaluated by quantitative realtime RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR), Northern and Western blot
analyses [18, 24]. Hut78 cells are characterized by
several interesting transforming properties, including
autocrine production of Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), growth factor
independence and the ability to produce tumors in mice
[67-70]. Interestingly, retroviral-mediated suppression
of AHI-1 reduced autocrine production of IL-2, IL-4 and
TNF-alpha in Hut78 cells by up to 85% and caused a
significant reduction in their growth factor independence

in semi-solid cultures (up to 10-fold) and in single-cell
cultures (4-fold) by comparison to cells transduced with
a control vector. It was interesting to note that these
phenotypes can be restored in vitro in the presence of
all three growth factors or IL-4 and TNF-alpha alone,
but not IL-2 alone, indicating that AHI-1 expression is
important in mediating autocrine production of cytokines
that may have a pathogenic role in the progression of
disease (Figure 3A). In addition, aberrant expression of
IL-2 and TNF-alpha also occurs in primary CD4+CD7Sezary cells, further supporting the idea that a multifactorial autocrine mechanism mediated by AHI-1 could
be involved in disease development. Importantly, the
ability of Hut78 cells to produce tumors in NOD/SCID-

(A) The number of CFCs able to make colonies in the absence of any growth factor (-GF) is significantly lower in Hut78 cells with AHI-1
suppression (AHI-1/sh4) compared to the empty vector control (RPG). This effect is rescued by adding the three growth factors (IL-2, IL-4
and TNF-α) to the media. (B) Subcutaneous injection of NOD/SCID-β2m immunodeficient mice with Hut78 cells and empty vector controls
(Hut78/RPG) results in tumor formation within 4 weeks in all injected mice. AHI-1-suppressed Hut78 cells cannot form any local tumors in
these mice even after 20 weeks. (C) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes from the microarray analysis selected by both Limma
and dChip analyses. Affymetrix GeneChip microarray analysis identified several differentially expressed genes in AHI-1-suppressed cells
compared to Hut78 and empty vector controls. Initial Limma analysis selected 283 differentially expressed probe sets, which was further
refined to 33 with the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) P value adjustment. (D) Protein expression of HCK (left panel) and BIN1 (right panel)

beta2microglobulin-/- mice within 4 weeks was also lost
when AHI-1 expression was suppressed (Figure 3B) [18].
Thus, lymphomagenic activity of Hut78 cells is somehow
dependent on the expression of AHI-1. Taken together,
these findings provide strong evidence of the oncogenic
activity of AHI-1 in human T-cell lymphomagenesis; its
deregulation may contribute to the development of human
CTCL, including Sezary syndrome. Further studies will
be needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms,
biological functions and clinical role of deregulated AHI1 expression in CTCL.

kinase) is a member of the Src family tyrosine kinases
and its expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells
with predominant expression in myeloid lineage cells and
B lymphocytes [71]. It has been reported that HCK has
oncogenic potential in Philadelphia chromosome-positive
(Ph+) leukemia and lymphoma cells [71, 72], however,
other studies also demonstrated tumor suppressor functions
for HCK in Ph- leukemias [73-75]. In CTCL cells, changes
in HCK protein expression and its phosphorylation were
observed in AHI-1-suppressed or overexpressed cells, and
suppression of activities of Src family kinases, including
HCK, by TKI (dasatinib) treatment resulted in reduced or
increased growth factor-independent growth of AHI-1overexpressed or -suppressed cells in a dose-dependent
fashion [24]. These results thus suggest that HCK could
be a critical player and potential target in AHI-1-mediated
CTCL cell transformation.
BIN1 (bridging integrator 1) is a nucleocytoplasmic
adaptor protein that was first identified through its
interaction with MYC oncoprotein, where it inhibits
its transforming activity [76]. MYC is involved in the
development of many cancers, where its overexpression
is associated with poor prognosis. BIN1 attenuation is
frequently described in several cancers, including lung,
breast and prostate cancer [77-80]. Alternative splicing

Genome U133 plus 2.0 Arrays which contains over 47,000
transcripts (54,330 probes) recently identified several
differentially expressed genes that may play critical roles
in AHI-1-mediated leukemic transformation of human
CTCL cells (Figure 3C) [24]. Two strong candidates
identified in this study are a tyrosine kinase, HCK, and
a tumor suppressor, BIN1, which show upregulation
at both RNA and protein levels in AHI-1-suppressed
CTCL cells (Figure 3D) [24]. HCK (hematopoietic cell

BIN1, with the inclusion of exon 12A, is localized in the cytoplasm, cannot interact with c-MYC and does not have any tumor suppressor
activity in cancerous cells.

can yield more than 10 isoforms of BIN1 with diverse
patterns of distribution between tissues, subcellular
localization and protein interactions [76, 78, 81, 82].
Notably, only nuclear-localizing isoforms of BIN1 have
tumor suppressor activities that can restrict proliferation,
survival, and immune escape of oncogenically transformed
cells (Figure 4) [24, 83-85]. In particular, aberrant splicing
of a brain-specific exon (exon 12A, Figure 4) in malignant
cells can abolish the tumor-suppressor activity of BIN1
by interfering with MYC binding [77], which is regulated
by phosphorylation of MYC at Ser62 [86]. It has recently
been documented that Bin1 loss can promote immune
escape in cancer by deregulating the immunomodulatory
enzyme indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO); IDO
inhibitors have also been found to potentiate cancer
chemotherapy [87]. Moreover, it has been shown that
Bin1 interacts with the c-ABL tyrosine kinase in an SH3dependent manner [88]. Similarly, AHI-1 has recently been
found to physically interact with BCR-ABL to mediate
malignant transformation of CML stem/progenitor cells
[19]. Interestingly, characterization of BIN1 in normal
and leukemic hematopoietic cells has not been previously
described; nevertheless, induced up-regulation of BIN1 is
observed in AHI-1 suppressed cells and down-regulation
of BIN1 is found in SS patient samples (Figure 3D &E).
Knockdown of AHI-1 expression in CTCL cells can
normalize their transforming activity and this effect
seems to be associated with induction of up-regulation of
BIN1 and down-regulation of its interacting oncoprotein,
MYC [24]. Thus AHI-1 may directly or indirectly inhibit
expression of BIN1 to enhance its oncogenic activity,
possibly through interaction with MYC. These findings
strongly suggest that AHI-1 may cooperate with BIN1
in the loss of its tumor suppressor activity through
its interacting oncoprotein MYC to mediate cellular
proliferation and apoptosis control of human CTCL cells
and drive human CTCL pathogenesis.

deregulates cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and genomic
stability of primitive CML cells through effects on multiple
intracellular signaling pathways such as the JAK2-STAT,
RAS and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways
[5, 6].	 Recognition of the consistent molecular and
genetic alteration of BCR-ABL in CML patients’ leukemic
cells led to the development of TKIs with selectivity for
the BCR-ABL kinase [4, 89, 90]. Imatinib (IM) was the
first TKI developed and has proven effective for treatment
of early phase CML [8-10]. However, early relapses,
acquired drug resistance and persistence of leukemic stem
cells remain significant issues in many CML patients [10,
91, 92]. The major clinical limitations encountered with
IM therapy are: (1) IM must be given continually for
many years and its discontinuation always results in rapid
reappearance of large numbers of leukemic cells [93-96];
(2) Even in treated patients, 15-25% of patients in early CP
and up 40% with AP disease will fail treatment, indicating
a need for alternatives [10, 92, 97, 98]; and (3) Relapses
are frequently associated with mutations in the BCRABL kinase domain [91, 92, 99]. Dasatinib (DA) and
Nilotinib (NL) are the second generation of TKIs [89, 90].
Initial clinical experience with both DA and NL indicates
that they may also elicit inadequate responses and fail
to prevent early disease progression in some patients
[100, 101]. In particular, the T315I mutation, found in
patients with IM-resistant disease, has been shown to also
mediate resistance to DA and NL [102, 103]. Clinical
evidence thus suggests that single agent molecularlytargeted therapy may not cure most patients as molecular
remissions are rare. These observations emphasize the
need for development of new agents and new strategies to
prevent continuous development of resistant subclones in
primitive CML cells.

Distinct features of CML stem cells resulting in
drug resistance

BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF AHI-1 IN
HUMAN CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA

Accumulating evidence indicates that primitive
quiescent CML cells are relatively unresponsive to TKIs
[104, 105]. We and others have recently discovered that
CML stem cells are insensitive to IM, with multiple unique
features that would be expected to promote intrinsic and
acquired resistance to BCR-ABL-targeted therapeutics [2,
106-109]. These include elevated BCR-ABL expression
and TK activity (Figure 5A), deregulated expression of
several transporter genes (OCT1, ABCB1 and ABCG2)
and a high degree of genetic instability. Thus, leukemic
stem cells are a critical source of disease recurrence
and a significant reservoir for the emergence of drugresistant subclones and it is therefore critical to identify
other therapies targeting CML stem cells to overcome
resistance.

Clinical challenges in the treatment of CML
CML has long served as a paradigm for generating
new insights into the cellular origin, pathogenesis and
improved treatment approaches for many types of
human cancer. It is a clonal, multi-step, multi-lineage
myeloproliferative disease that typically evolves through
three distinct stages: chronic phase (CP), accelerated
phases (AP) and blast crisis (BC) [1, 2]. The feature that
uniquely defines CML is a clone-specific BCR-ABL fusion
gene that encodes an oncoprotein with constitutively
elevated tyrosine kinase (TK) activity, driving the
pathogenesis of the disease [4-6]. Activation of BCR-ABL

Deregulated AHI-1 expression in CML stem
cells and its enhanced transforming activity in
conjunction with BCR-ABL in vitro and in vivo
Interestingly, overexpression of either Ahi-1 or BCRABL alone in a murine IL-3 dependent pro-B cell line,
BaF3, increases proliferation and viability of these cells in
the absence and presence of IL-3. However, overexpression
of both of these genes simultaneously enhances these
effects [19]. Moreover, intravenous injection of NOD/
SCID-beta2m immunodeficient mice with either Ahi-1- or
BCR-ABL-transduced BaF3 cells causes lethal leukemia
within 70 and 40 days, respectively (Figure 5B). However,
leukemogenic activities of co-transduced Ahi-1 and BCRABL are further enhanced, producing a shorter latency of
26 days [19]. In addition, overexpression of either Ahi1 or BCR-ABL alone in primitive murine hematopoietic
stem cells (HSC) can increase their proliferation in liquid
media, as well as elevating the number of colonies from
both the colony forming cell (CFC) assay, an assay

used to measure the activity of progenitor cells, and
the long term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay, an
assay for measuring stem cell activities in vitro [110112]. Importantly, in murine HSCs co-transduced with
Ahi-1 and BCR-ABL, all of these effects are enhanced
[19]. Thus, overexpression of Ahi-1/AHI-1 alone can
transform primitive hematopoietic cells in vitro and in
vivo; these effects are enhanced by BCR-ABL. In addition
to overexpression studies, stable suppression of AHI-1 by
small interfering RNA in primary CML stem/progenitor
cells reduces growth autonomy. Furthermore, coexpression of Ahi-1 in BCR-ABL inducible cells reverses
growth deficiencies exhibited by down-regulation of BCRABL and results in sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of
BCR-ABL and enhanced activation of the JAK2/STAT5
pathway [19]. Importantly, co-immunoprecipitation assays
have identified a new AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 interaction
complex at endogenous levels in CML cells [19]. JAK2 is
known to directly interact with the C-terminus of BCRABL and to be a critical target of BCR-ABL in CML

[113-115]. Therefore, through an AHI-1-BCR-ABLJAK2 interaction complex, AHI-1 regulates transforming
activities of BCR-ABL transformed cells associated with
sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and
enhanced activation of JAK2/STAT5 (Figure 5D).

[116, 117] and that treatment with TKIs in combination
with TG101209 results in greater inhibition of CML stem
and progenitor cells, compared to treatment with either
TKIs or TG101209 alone or a combination of TKIs (Chen,
DeGeer and Jiang, unpublished data). Thus, targeting both
BCR-ABL and JAK2 in CML stem/progenitor cells will
provide a rational strategy for improving the treatment
outcome of CML patients (Figure 5D).

Regulation of IM sensitivity of CML stem/
progenitor cells by AHI-1

AHI-1 IS DISRUPTED IN JOUBERT
SYNDROME AND OTHER RELATED
BRAIN DISORDERS

As described above, IM is an inhibitor of the BCRABL tyrosine kinase and the first-line therapy for the
CML patients [4, 8, 9]. However, early relapses and IMresistance are two major problems in some IM-treated
CML patients [10]. Studies have indicated that CML stem
cells, especially those that are in the quiescent G0 stage of
the cell cycle, are less responsive to IM, and are therefore
a critical target population for IM resistance [104-106].
Thus, identification of other therapies targeting CML stem
cells, as well as development of complementary therapies
that target molecular events downstream of BCR-ABL are
two major challenges in the treatment of CML.
There are several close biological connections
between AHI-1 and BCR-ABL. Both AHI-1 and BCR-ABL
transcript levels are significantly increased in the CML stem
cell-enriched population (lin-CD34+CD38-) as compared
to normal BM (Figure 5A) [17, 106, 107] and AHI-1 and
BCR-ABL transcript levels are significantly higher in CML
stem/progenitor cells from IM-nonresponders and blast
crisis patients compared to the same cells isolated from
IM-responders [19]. Interestingly, the AHI-1-BCR-ABLJAK2 complex was reported to play a key role in regulating
IM response/resistance in BCR-ABL-transduced cells and
primary CML stem/progenitors. Overexpression of AHI1 in human K562 cells resulted in greater resistance to
IM, while suppression of AHI-1 resulted in increased
sensitivity to IM [19]. Altering AHI-1 expression in
K562 cells mediates changes in phosphorylation and
protein expression of BCR-ABL, JAK2 and STAT5, with
enhanced activity and expression of these proteins when
AHI-1 is overexpressed, reduced activity and expression
when AHI-1 is suppressed, and restored effects in AHI-1
suppressed cells with overexpression of AHI-1. Strikingly,
suppression of AHI-1 expression in primary CML stem/
progenitor cells also resulted in increased TKI sensitivity
(Figure 5C). Particularly, CML stem/progenitor cells from
IM-nonresponders and blast crisis patients became more
sensitive to TKIs when AHI-1 expression was suppressed.
Together, these findings provide strong evidence that
AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 complex modulates response/
resistance to TKIs in CML stem/progenitor cells (Figure
5D).
Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that
JAK2 inhibitors (TG101209, WP1193) and a dual kinase
inhibitor of JAK2 and ABL kinases (ON044580) induce
apoptosis in IM-sensitive and IM-resistant CML cell lines

In addition to the role of Ahi-1/AHI-1 in the
development of leukemia and lymphoma in mice and
humans, studies have also demonstrated its function
in brain disorders such as Joubert syndrome (JS) and
related disorders (JSRD), schizophrenia and autism [20,
21, 118-121]. JSRD are autosomal recessive disorders,
characterized by a developmental mid-hindbrain
malformation. ‘‘Molar tooth sign’’ is the characteristic
feature on a cerebral MRI, which defines the cerebellar
vermis and brainstem anomalies and is the diagnostic
marker of Joubert syndrome [122-125]. JSRD is
considered a multisystem disease, with extra-neurological
features including retinal degeneration and cystic kidney
disease (e.g. nephronophthisis) [126, 127].
Interestingly, genetic pedigree analysis has
demonstrated a high linkage and association between the
AHI-1 locus and JS, a rare autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by abnormal brain development and mental
retardation [20, 21, 118]. A high frequency of AHI-1
mutations can be identified in patients with JS, with most
mutations being frameshift or nonsense mutations which
result in truncated N-terminal AHI-1 or loss of the WD40repeat and/or SH3 domains [20, 21]. Recently, several
linkage and association studies have further identified
AHI-1 as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, a major
neuropsychiatric disorders associated with depression
[119-121, 128, 129]. It is worth noting that several
features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), such as
deficits in social behaviour, language dysfunction and
repetitive behaviours, have also been described in up to
40% of patients with JS [130, 131]. A three-stage familybased association study has demonstrated evidence of an
associated haplotype in AHI-1 with ASD in a region of
the genes that has also been associated with schizophrenia
[25]. These findings suggest an important role for AHI1 in
common brain disorders affecting human cognition and
behaviour.
Despite a strong genetic association of the AHI-1
gene with susceptibility to several neuronal diseases, the
functions of AHI-1 in regulating normal brain development
and disease pathogenesis remain largely unknown. It has
recently been reported that Ahi-1 forms a stable complex
927

the use of Ahi-1-deficient mouse models has facilitated
our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and the
pathogenesis of JS and its related JSRD, and enabled
identification of potential Ahi-1/AHI-1 interacting
proteins critical in the development of these diseases.

with huntingtin-associated protein 1 (Hap1) in mouse
brains [57], a protein which is important for neonatal
development and involved in intracellular trafficking [23,
132-135]. Ahi-1 and Hap1 stabilize each other; Hap1
knockout mice display a significant reduction in Ahi-1
expression levels, defective cerebellar development and
abnormal axonal decussation. Similarly, suppression of
Ahi-1 in cerebellar neurons from postnatal mouse brains
decreases Hap1 levels. In addition, truncated Ahi-1,
which corresponds to the mutations in JS, prevents neurite
outgrowth in neuronal culture and is unable to stabilize
Hap1 [57]. Furthermore, reduction in either Ahi-1 or Hap1
in cerebellar neurons from postnatal mouse brains reduces
the protein level of tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB)
[57], which is critical for neuronal differentiation and
brain development [136, 137]. Similarly, Ahi-1 deficiency
in mouse brain alters TrkB signaling by promoting the
degradation of endocytic TrkB, reducing TrkB signaling
in neuronal cells and resulting in depressive phenotypes,
which can be alleviated with antidepressant drugs or
by overexpression of TrkB in the amygdala [58]. These
results provide evidence for the involvement of Ahi-1
deficiency in depression, which occurs in JSRD and has
been found to be associated with the AHI-1 gene locus.
JSRD has additional neurological features, such as
nephronophthisis and retinal degeneration [126, 127].
Ahi-1-null mice with complete loss of the Ahi-1 protein
have normal embryonic development; however, the mice
show postnatal runting and the majority do not survive to
adulthood [59, 138]. The brain morphology of these mice
is highly preserved, suggesting that other effects outside
of the nervous system influence the survival of these mice
[138]. One study has demonstrated the development of
the cystic kidney disease nephronophthisis as a potential
cause of death in Ahi-1-null mice [59]. Furthermore,
mouse models with conditional Ahi-1 knockout in the
kidneys have demonstrated a significant decrease in basal
Wnt activity [59]. The Wnt signalling pathway functions
in a broad array of cellular processes, and mutations in
this pathway have been identified in variety of diseases,
from developmental disorders to cancer [139, 140]. In
addition, Wnt activity is upregulated in mouse renal injury,
suggesting its potential role in adult renal homeostatic
injury repair [141]. Interestingly, Ahi-1 interacts with
beta-catenin, an integral component in the Wnt signaling
pathway, and facilitates its translocation and accumulation
in the nucleus, resulting in positive modulation of
downstream transcription [59]. In vivo studies have shown
that Ahi-1 is also required for the Wnt response to injury
and renal tubule repair, a function that is abrogated in Ahi1-knockout kidneys, leading to renal cystogenesis [59].
Moreover, other studies have demonstrated that Ahi-1
knockout mice fail to form photoreceptor sensory cilia and
photoreceptor outer segments. The retinal degeneration
in Ahi-1 knockout mice resembles the retinal phenotype
observed in patients with JSRD [138, 142]. In summary,

CONCLUSION
The discovery of ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors
has marked a major advance in the cancer therapy field.
It has provided an excellent example of how a specific
molecular abnormality can be targeted therapeutically to
transform a life-threatening malignancy into a chronic
disease. However, TKI therapy is not curative and does not
eliminate leukemia stem cells, which remain a potential of
relapse. Resistance to single TKI therapy is increasingly
being recognized, and more effective strategies using
combination therapies are needed to combat the
emergence of disease resistance by effectively eradicating
leukemic stem cells. Understanding the unique biological
properties of cancer stem cells and identifying oncogenes
and tumor suppressors and the molecular networks that
regulate these properties continue to provide new insights
into the complex processes of malignant transformation
and disease progression and to uncover improved
therapeutic options to eradicate these critical cells and
develop molecular cures. Additional insights of broader
applicability and benefit will also be forthcoming from
such studies.
