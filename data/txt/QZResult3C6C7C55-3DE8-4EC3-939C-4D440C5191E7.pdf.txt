Abstract
Although ovarian carcinomas with mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2
are sensitive to platinum compounds, such carcinomas
eventually develop platinum resistance. Previously, we showed
that acquired resistance to cisplatin in BRCA2-mutated
tumors can be mediated by secondary intragenic mutations
in BRCA2 that restore the wild-type BRCA2 reading frame.
Here, we show that secondary mutations of BRCA1 also occur
in BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer with platinum resistance.
We evaluated nine recurrent BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancers
previously treated with platinum compounds, including five
with acquired platinum resistance, one with primary platinum
resistance, and three with platinum sensitivity. Four of the
six recurrent platinum-resistant tumors had developed secondary genetic changes in BRCA1 that restored the reading
frame of the BRCA1 protein, whereas none of the three
platinum-sensitive recurrent tumors developed BRCA1 sequence alterations. We immunohistochemically confirmed
restored expression of BRCA1 protein in two cases with
secondary mutations. Intriguingly, the case with primary
platinum resistance showed back mutation of BRCA1 in the
primary tumor and showed another secondary mutation in the
recurrent tumor. Our results suggest that secondary mutations
in BRCA1 can mediate resistance to platinum in BRCA1mutated ovarian tumors. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2581–6]

Introduction
DNA cross-linking agents such as cisplatin, carboplatin,
melphalan, and cyclophosphamide are widely used anticancer
drugs. Resistance to these agents is a major obstacle to effective
cancer therapy. Patients with ovarian cancer usually respond well
to initial chemotherapy with cisplatin and its derivative carboplatin, but over time the majority of patients become refractory to
platinum compounds. Ultimately, progression of chemoresistant
disease is the major cause of death in women with ovarian
carcinoma (1).
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes responsible for
familial breast/ovarian cancer. BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2)
mutation carriers have increased risks of developing breast and

ovarian cancer (2). Ten percent to 15% of all epithelial ovarian
cancers are associated with inherited mutations in BRCA1/2 (3, 4).
The vast majority of tumors from women with germ-line BRCA1/2
mutations show loss of the wild-type BRCA1/2 allele and are
considered to be BRCA1/2 deficient (5–7).
BRCA1/2-deficient cancer cells are hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking agents including cisplatin (8–10). Consistently, patients
developing BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer have a better prognosis compared with noncarriers, if they receive platinum-based
therapy (8, 11). However, even BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancers
frequently develop platinum resistance.
Recently, we reported that acquired resistance to cisplatin in
BRCA2-mutated tumors can be mediated by secondary mutations
in BRCA2 that restore the wild-type BRCA2 reading frame (12).
BRCA2-mutated cancer cells selected in the presence of cisplatin
acquired secondary genetic changes on the mutated BRCA2 allele,
which canceled the frameshift caused by the inherited mutation
and restored expression of functional nearly-full-length BRCA2
protein. Cells with secondary mutations were resistant to cisplatin
(12). However, mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in BRCA1mutated ovarian cancer remain unclear. Because both BRCA1 and
BRCA2 are involved in homologous recombination DNA repair
(13, 14) and are required for cellular resistance to cisplatin (9, 10),
we hypothesized that similar secondary mutations of the mutated
BRCA1 gene mediate acquired resistance to cisplatin in BRCA1mutated ovarian cancer. Now we report that secondary mutations
of BRCA1 also occur in BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer with
platinum resistance.

Materials and Methods
Clinical specimens. Three DNA samples from recurrent BRCA1 mutated ovarian cancer patients were obtained from Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center (Los Angeles, CA) through the Pacific Ovarian Cancer Research
Consortium. Six DNA samples from BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer
patients with recurrent disease were obtained from the tissue bank of
University of Washington (Table 1). DNA from UW80, UW40, UWF27, and
the recurrent tumor from UW91 were obtained after laser capture
microdissection. The study was approved by Institutional Review Boards
of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington.
Clinical data of UW40 patient and a cancer cell line derived from the same
patient’s recurrent tumor (UWB1.289) have previously been reported (15).
Platinum sensitivity was defined as a complete response to treatment
maintained without progression for at least 6 mo after platinum therapy.
Tumors that were resistant or refractory had progressive disease on
platinum therapy, less than a complete response to platinum therapy or
progression within 6 mo of completing platinum therapy.
Sequencing of BRCA1. PCR products of genomic DNA were analyzed
for sequence alterations with BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems) using ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). All detected mutations were confirmed by sequencing of an

primers for BRCA1 is available in Supplementary Table S1. All nucleotide
numbers refer to the wild-type cDNA human sequence of BRCA1 (U14680.1)
as reported in the GenBank database.
Immunohistochemical studies. BRCA1 protein was detected in
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections using the mouse monoclonal
antibody MS110 (previously called Ab-1; Oncogene Research Products) as
previously described (16). The MS110 antibody recognizes an NH2-terminal
epitope at BRCA1 (amino acid residues 89–222; ref. 16). Briefly, paraffin
sections were deparaffinized, washed in PBS, and treated with steam heat
for 20 min using antigen target retrieval solution (DAKO). Endogenous
peroxidase activity in paraffin sections was quenched by treatment with
3% H2O2 for 5 min. Sections were washed with PBS and nonspecific binding
was blocked by treatment for 2 h in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS.
Primary antibody was applied (MS110 at 1:250 dilution) for 14 to 16 h at
4jC. Secondary antibody and streptavidin biotin-peroxidase were from the
Universal Large Volume LSAB+, Peroxidase kit (DAKO) and were each
applied for 30 min at room temperature. 3,3¶-Diaminobenzidine chromagen
(Sigma) was used to visualize antibody complexes and sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin. The MS110 antibody can result in
nonstaining of tissues under certain conditions and can be variable in its
results. Therefore, we used nontumor inflammatory and stromal cells as an
internal positive control for BRCA1 protein staining for every section.
Decreased protein was only scored if normal cells on the same section were
positive. Primary and recurrent tumors were stained side by side under
identical conditions. MS110 is the most reliable antibody for the
immunohistochemical detection of BRCA1 (16). Because the MS110
antibody recognizes an NH2-terminal epitope in BRCA1, it cannot
distinguish between wild-type BRCA1 protein and truncated nonfunctional
protein resulting from frameshift mutations occurring distal to the antibody
epitope. Thus, MS110 is not suitable for distinguishing functional versus
nonfunctional BRCA1 protein in UW40, UW208, and UW317. Therefore,
we evaluated immunohistochemistry only in those tumors with 185delAG

mutations (proximal to the antibody epitope) for which we had paired
primary and recurrent paraffin-embedded tumor samples.

Results and Discussion
We analyzed nine clinical samples of recurrent BRCA1-mutated
ovarian cancer previously treated with platinum (Table 1). Six of
them were clinically platinum resistant and three were platinum
sensitive. One case (UW40) showed primary resistance to platinum,
whereas five cases were initially sensitive to platinum and acquired
resistance during the disease course. Three of the five tumors with
acquired platinum resistance (UW80, UW91, and UWF27) and the
primarily resistant tumor (UW40) had secondary genetic changes
in BRCA1, whereas none of the three cisplatin-sensitive recurrent
tumors showed secondary genetic changes in BRCA1.
UW80 patient is a heterozygous carrier of a frameshift BRCA1
mutation, 185delAG, which is common in the Ashkenazi Jewish
population (Fig. 1A; ref. 17). In the primary tumor specimen, only
BRCA1 sequence with 185delAG was detected, indicating that the
tumor had lost the wild-type allele. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of
an intragenic BRCA1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was
also confirmed. In the microdissected recurrent tumor from the
same patient after development of resistance to platinum, LOH of
the BRCA1 SNP was confirmed, indicating that the recurrent tumor
contained only the same single allele of BRCA1 as present in the
primary tumor and that contamination of nontumor cells was
negligible. In this recurrent sample, wild-type BRCA1 sequence
represented >80% of the sequences at the mutation site, suggesting
that the recurrent tumor had acquired wild-type BRCA1 by genetic
reversion (back mutation to wild-type).

Secondary BRCA1 Mutations

Similarly, in two more BRCA1.185delAG cases (UW91 and
UWF27), the primary tumor showed only mutant sequence with
loss of the wild-type allele. In the recurrent tumors, we mainly
detected wild-type BRCA1 sequence, suggesting that these two

platinum-resistant tumors acquired wild-type BRCA1 by genetic
reversion (back mutation to wild-type; Fig. 1B). Both cases had
confirmation of LOH at intragenic SNPs in the primary and
recurrent tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating the presence

lymphocytes and the primary and recurrent tumors from a patient (UW80) with BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer. In the lymphocytes, a heterozygous SNP of the BRCA1
locus (4956A/G) was detected, in addition to a heterozygous mutation (185delAG). In the primary tumor, a hemizygous mutation (185delAG) was detected and loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) of the SNP was confirmed. In the microdissected recurrent tumor, LOH of the SNP was confirmed, but wild-type sequence was 80% to 90% of
the sequences identified at the site of 185delAG. Importantly, the SNP in the recurrent tumor (4956G) is identical to that in the primary tumor (4956G). This indicates
that the recurrent tumor had acquired wild-type BRCA1 by genetic reversion (back mutation to wild-type). Residual 185delAG sequence could represent heterogeneity in
the tumor. A speculative model of BRCA1 alleles in samples from this patient is also depicted. B, DNA sequences of BRCA1 in peripheral blood lymphocytes; the primary

suggesting that the recurrent tumors had acquired wild-type BRCA1 by back mutation. Analyses of intragenic SNPs of these cases are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.

of a single BRCA1 allele that underwent a secondary genetic
alteration.
BRCA1.185delAG encodes a severely truncated protein with 38
amino acids, and the back mutation should restore full-length
BRCA1 protein (Fig. 2A). Consistently, immunohistochemical study
revealed that BRCA1 protein expression was absent in the primary
tumors of UW80 and UW91, but strongly positive in their recurrent
tumors (Fig. 2B and data not shown).
The mechanism for genetic reversion of 185delAG mutations in
all three tumors is not clear. At the genomic level, the reinsertion of
two missing nucleotides would seem less likely to occur than a
secondary downstream deletion that corrects the frameshift and
restores the open reading frame. Several possible explanations for
this phenomenon are not mutually exclusive. First, we speculate
that because 185delAG is in a critical portion of the BRCA1 gene
close to the RING finger (Fig. 2A), a change of one single amino
acid here is likely to have deleterious effect on protein function.
Similarly, missense mutations in the RING finger such as C61G
can be deleterious (18). Therefore, restoration of BRCA1 function
may require complete reversion of a mutant in this domain to wildtype. Another possibility is that the particular genomic sequence
surrounding 185delAG somehow facilitates the genetic reversion.
A third possibility is that other downstream mutations do occur
in some tumors but are not detected with our relatively short
PCR amplifications. We are unable to do long-range PCR that
might identify larger genomic events because of the fragmented
nature of our DNA. Thus, it is easier to identify genetic reversion
in our samples than larger events that restore the open reading
frame.
UW40 patient is a heterozygous carrier of a frameshift BRCA1
mutation, 2594delC (Fig. 3A and B). The mutant allele encodes an
844-amino-acid protein that lacks BRCT domains (Fig. 3C). The
patient had a past history of breast cancer at the age of 42 years
and developed ovarian cancer at age 54 years. The primary ovarian
carcinoma was clinically resistant to platinum. After six cycles of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

platinum and Taxol, the patient was treated with Taxol for three
additional cycles with development of progression. She was retreated with topotecan, then with gemcitabine and Adriamycin to
obtain a partial remission. Recurrent tumor was then obtained at
the time of surgery for a fistula.
LOH of three intragenic BRCA1 SNPs (2201C/T, 2430T/C, and
2731C/T) that flank the mutation site was confirmed in both the
primary and recurrent tumors (Fig. 3A and B, and data not shown),
indicating that contamination by nontumor cells was negligible
and that both the primary and recurrent tumors had lost one
BRCA1 allele. Intriguingly, in the primary tumor, both wild-type
BRCA1 sequence and BRCA1 sequence with 2594delC were
detected (Fig. 3A and B). Careful laser microdissection of a
separate second sample of this tumor revealed the same result. The
presence of both wild-type BRCA1 sequence and mutant sequence
on one allele in the primary tumor suggests that genetic reversion
(back mutation to wild-type) occurred on one copy of the mutant
allele. We speculate that the presence of the genetically reverted
wild-type allele in the primary tumor contributed to the unusual
initial platinum resistance of this tumor. The selective pressure
for the genetically reverted tumor cells in the primary ovarian
tumor is unknown, but may be related to the 11 months of
cyclophoshamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil that the patient
previously received for breast cancer. Cyclophosphamide is a DNA
cross-linking agent and could exert similar selection pressure for
the correction of DNA repair defects as we have observed with
exposure to platinum agents.
An alternative explanation for the existence of genetic reversion
and other secondary mutations on a mutant allele in this primary
tumor is that these events are more common than we appreciate
but usually occur in only a small number of primary tumor cells
before exposure to chemotherapy. Then, chemotherapy provides the
selection pressure for expansion of these subclones in recurrent
tumors. Perhaps some reports of retention of the wild-type BRCA1/2
allele in breast cancers (19) actually represent genetic reversion.

Secondary BRCA1 Mutations

Only careful haplotyping distinguishes tumors with retention of the
wild-type allele from those with genetic reversion.
The genetically reverted wild-type allele was then lost at some
point during the disease course. In the recurrent tumor, we could
no longer detect wild-type sequence, but we found a second site
small deletion (2606_2628del23) in addition to the inherited

mutation (2594delC). The second mutation corrects the frameshift
caused by the inherited mutation and the allele BRCA1.2594delC;2606_2628del23 encodes a BRCA1 protein with intact COOHterminal region, which may be functional (Fig. 3C). The actual
genomic DNA sequence of BRCA1 in the UW40 recurrent tumor is
a mixture of 2594delC;2606_2628del23 and 2594delC without a

ovarian cancer. In the lymphocytes, heterozygous SNPs of the BRCA1 locus (2201C/T and 2430T/C) were detected, in addition to a heterozygous mutation
(2594delC). In the primary tumor, LOH of the SNPs was confirmed, but the primary tumor specimen shows heterozygous sequence of wild-type BRCA1 and a BRCA1
mutation (2594delC). In the recurrent tumor specimen, LOH of the SNPs was confirmed and mixed sequences of 2594delC and 2594delC;2606_2628del23 were
detected. B, a speculative model of BRCA1 alleles in samples from this patient. The lymphocytes have both the wild-type and mutant (2594delC) alleles. The primary
tumor has lost the wild-type BRCA1 allele with SNPs 2201T and 2430C, but has retained the allele with the inherited mutation (2594delC) and SNPs 2201C and 2430T.
This mutant allele has presumably been duplicated, and one of the mutated alleles is reverted to wild-type by genetic reversion (back mutation to wild-type). In
the recurrent tumor, the allele with wild-type BRCA1 sequence is lost, and the allele with the inherited mutation (2594delC) was again duplicated. One of them obtained
a different second mutation (2606_2628del23), which cancels the frameshift caused by the inherited mutation (2594delC). This model explains why we see mixed
sequences of BRCA1 in the primary and recurrent tumors. C, schematic presentation of BRCA1 proteins encoded by 2594delC and 2594delC;2606_2628del23.

secondary mutation (Fig. 3A). The mixture of sequences on one
allele in both the primary and recurrent tumors may have
occurred by secondary genetic alterations (reversion to wild-type
in the primary tumor and 23-bp deletion in the recurrent tumor)
occurring on just one of the duplicated mutant alleles (Fig. 3B),
similar to the situation occurring in Capan-1 clones with
secondary mutations of BRCA2 observed in the in vitro
experiment in the previous report (12). Alternatively, the two
sequences could represent tumor heterogeneity, with only a
subset of tumor cells acquiring a secondary mutation on the
mutant allele. We favor the explanation of tumor heterogeneity in
this case, given that a cell line developed from this recurrent
tumor contains only mutant sequence without secondary genetic
changes (15).
Taken together, secondary mutations that restore the reading
frame of mutated BRCA1 alleles were frequently observed in
ovarian tumors with resistance to platinum. These results suggest
that secondary mutations of BRCA1 can be a mechanism of
acquired resistance to cisplatin in BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer.
In addition, the observation of the back mutation of BRCA1 in
cisplatin-resistant primary tumor of UW40 patient suggests that
secondary mutations of BRCA1 can be a mechanism of primary
resistance to cisplatin.
Our present and previous (12) studies emphasize that BRCA1 and
BRCA2 are not only cancer susceptibility genes but are also critical
determinants of clinical sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy. These studies support the general concept that defective
DNA repair leads to chemosensitivity, whereas restoration of
functional DNA repair contributes to acquired chemoresistance in
tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.
Testing for secondary mutations in platinum-treated BRCA1mutated cancers may be clinically important because tumors with

secondary mutations are likely to be resistant to platinum and
could show cross-resistance to other agents that exploit BRCA1
defects, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 inhibitors. A larger
clinical study is warranted to further determine the prevalence and
clinical significance of secondary mutations of BRCA1 in BRCA1mutated cancer.
Our finding could have implications for sporadic ovarian
carcinoma. Although somatic mutation of BRCA1/2 is rare in
sporadic ovarian carcinoma, BRCA1 is reported to be downregulated in a subset of sporadic ovarian carcinomas by promoter
methylation and other unknown mechanisms (20). BRCA2 mRNA
expression is reported to be undetectable by reverse transcription
PCR in 13% of ovarian carcinoma (20). Therefore, it is tempting to
hypothesize that down-regulation of BRCA1/2 causes initial
sensitivity to cisplatin, and restoration of functional BRCA1/2
expression by demethylation of the BRCA1 promoter or other
mechanisms leads to acquired resistance. Testing this hypothesis
will be important to elucidate the more general roles of BRCA1/2
in platinum sensitivity and resistance.
