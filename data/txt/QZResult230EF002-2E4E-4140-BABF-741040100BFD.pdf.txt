Abstract
Protein kinases represent promising anticancer drug targets.
We describe here the meriolins, a new family of inhibitors of
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). Meriolins represent a chemical structural hybrid between meridianins and variolins, two
families of kinase inhibitors extracted from various marine
invertebrates. Variolin B is currently in preclinical evaluation
as an antitumor agent. A selectivity study done on 32 kinases
showed that, compared with variolin B, meriolins display
enhanced specificity toward CDKs, with marked potency on
CDK2 and CDK9. The structures of pCDK2/cyclin A/variolin B
and pCDK2/cyclin A/meriolin 3 complexes reveal that the
two inhibitors bind within the ATP binding site of the kinase,
but in different orientations. Meriolins display better antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties in human tumor
cell cultures than their parent molecules, meridianins and
variolins. Phosphorylation at CDK1, CDK4, and CDK9 sites on,
respectively, protein phosphatase 1A, retinoblastoma protein,
and RNA polymerase II is inhibited in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y
cells exposed to meriolins. Apoptosis triggered by meriolins is
accompanied by rapid Mcl-1 down-regulation, cytochrome c
release, and activation of caspases. Meriolin 3 potently inhibits
tumor growth in two mouse xenograft cancer models, namely,
Ewing’s sarcoma and LS174T colorectal carcinoma. Meriolins
thus constitute a new CDK inhibitory scaffold, with promising
antitumor activity, derived from molecules initially isolated
from marine organisms. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8325–34]

Introduction
Altered protein phosphorylation is a frequent feature in numerous human diseases. This last decade has therefore witnessed
considerable efforts to identify, optimize, and evaluate pharmacologic inhibitors of protein kinases (reviews in refs. 1, 2). Currently,
f60 kinase inhibitors are undergoing clinical evaluation against
cancers, inflammation, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Among the 518 human kinases, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)
have attracted considerable interest given their involvement in
many essential physiologic pathways and aberrant activities in
multiple human diseases, especially in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (review in ref. 3). Consequently, many pharmacologic
inhibitors of CDKs have been found to display promising antitumor and/or neuroprotective activities (reviews in refs. 4–8). To
our knowledge, eight CDK inhibitors are currently undergoing
clinical evaluation as anticancer drugs [flavopiridol (Alvocidib),
R-roscovitine (CYC202, Seliciclib), R547, SNS-032, PD-0332991,
AZD5438, AG-024322 and AT7519]. All CDK inhibitors identified
to date are ATP-competitive, and many have been co-crystallized
with a CDK target (review in ref. 1). The selectivity of these
pharmacologic inhibitors is a matter of extensive investigation
using a wide variety of methods (review in ref. 9). Although a few
kinase inhibitors are rather unselective (like staurosporine), many
display a definite specificity profile, but all inhibit several kinases.
For example, many CDK inhibitors also inhibit glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (GSK-3; ref. 10) and sometimes casein kinase 1 (CK1).
Multitarget inhibitors may find appropriate medicinal use because
they are less likely to allow resistance to develop.
We recently identified meridianins, a family of 3-(2-aminopyrimidine)indoles, as a promising kinase-inhibitory scaffold (11).
Meridianins are natural products initially extracted from Aplidium
meridianum, an Ascidian from the South Atlantic (12). Meridianin
derivatives have been synthesized by various groups (13–15).
Although some meridianins inhibit various kinases such as CDKs,
GSK-3, cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, and CK1, they displayed modest antiproliferative effects. Meridianins share some
structural similarity with variolins, another family of marine natural
compounds containing a central pyrido[3¶,2¶:4,5]pyrrolo[1,2-c]
pyrimidine core substituted with a 2-aminopyrimidine ring. Variolins were initially extracted from Kirkpatrickia variolosa, a rare
Antarctic sponge (16, 17). Total synthesis by Morris (18, 19) and
others (20, 21) allowed easy access to the variolins. Variolin B and
deoxyvariolin B (PM01218) display potent cytotoxicity against
several human cancer cell lines (17, 22, 23); as a result, PM01218
is being investigated by PharmaMar as a potential antitumor drug.
Recently, as this work was in progress, variolin B and deoxyvariolin
B were reported to inhibit CDKs (23).
In this article, we have exploited the chemical similarity between
meridianins and variolins to synthesize a hybrid structure, the
meriolins. Surprisingly, meriolins display potent inhibitory activity
and relative selectivity toward CDKs and also exhibit better

antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties in cell cultures than
their ‘‘inspirational parent’’ molecules. Meriolins are particularly
potent inhibitors of CDK2 and CDK9. The crystal structures of
meriolin 3 and variolin B in complex with CDK2/cyclin A revealed
that the two molecules bind in very different orientations in the
ATP-binding pocket of the kinase. Meriolins prevent phosphorylation at CDK1-, CDK4-, and CDK9-specific sites in neuroblastoma
SH-SY5Y cells and induce the rapid degradation of the survival
factor Mcl-1. Meriolin 3 potently inhibits tumor growth in two
mouse xenograft models: Ewing’s sarcoma and LS174T colorectal
carcinoma. Meriolins thus constitute a new kinase-inhibitory
scaffold with promising antitumor activity.

Materials and Methods
Chemistry
Synthesis of meridianins, variolins, and meriolins. Meridianins A
and G were synthesized as described previously (15). Variolin B and deoxyvariolin B were synthesized in eight and six steps, respectively, as
described previously (18, 19). The synthesis of meriolins will be described
in detail in a separate article.9 Briefly, meriolins were prepared as follows.
Acylation of 7-azaindole derivatives (7-azaindole, 4-methoxy-7-azaindole, and
4-ethoxy-7-azaindole) in the presence of acetic anhydride and trifluoroacetic
acid afforded the 3-acetyl-7-azaindole derivatives in 55% to 84% yield. Nbenzenesulfonylation of the latter compounds was carried out in the presence of benzenesulfonyl chloride and sodium hydride in tetrahydrofuran to
give 3-acetyl-1-benzenesulfonyl-7-azaindole derivatives in 68% to 90% yield.
Treatment of the protected 7-azaindoles with N,N-dimethylformamide
dimethyl acetal in N,N-dimethylformamide afforded the corresponding
enaminones in 68% to 78% yield. Final formation of the pyrimidic nucleus
occurred by heating of enaminones in the presence of guanidine HCl and
anhydrous potassium carbonate in 2-methoxyethanol to afford meriolins 1, 3,
and 4 in 63% to 75% yield. O-demethylation of meriolin 3 was done in 48%
hydrobromic acid/acetic acid to afford meriolin 2 in 90% yield.

Crystallography
Expression, purification, and co-crystallization of human CDK2/
cyclin A with meriolin 3 and variolin B. Thr160-phosphorylated CDK2/
cyclin A (pCDK2/cyclin A) was purified as described previously (24) and
concentrated to 13 mg/mL in 40 mmol/L HEPES (pH, 7.0), 200 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.01% monothioglycerol. The protein solution was incubated for
20 min on ice with meriolin 3 (1.8 mmol/L) or variolin B (2.0 mmol/L)
before setting up hanging-drop crystallization trials. The reservoir solution
contained 0.6 to 0.8 mol/L KCl, 0.9 to 1.2 mol/L (NH4)2SO4, and 100 mmol/L
HEPES (pH, 7.0). Orthorhombic crystals grew within 3 weeks at 4jC.
Crystals were briefly soaked in 8 mol/L sodium formate before being cryocooled in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray crystallography data collection and processing, structure
solution, and refinement. Data were collected from a single crystal on
ESRF ID14-EH-2 beamline at 100K. Data processing and integration were
carried out using MOSFLM and SCALA (25). The structures were solved
by molecular replacement with MOLREP using a well-refined structure
of pCDK2/cyclin A10 as the search model. Two pCDK2/cyclin A
heterodimers were found in the asymmetrical unit. Strong electron
density corresponding to the bound inhibitor was seen at the ATP site
after rigid body refinement of the two structures. Inhibitor model
building and library generation for the two inhibitors were done using
the CCP4 software suite (25). Alternate cycles of rebuilding in Coot (26)
and refinement in Refmac (27) were carried out to obtain the final
models.

25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH, 7.5), 50 Ag heparin/mL. Buffer C: 60 mmol/L hglycerophosphate, 15 mmol/L p-nitrophenylphosphate, 25 mmol/L MOPS
(pH, 7.2), 5 mmol/L EGTA, 15 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L
sodium vanadate, 1 mmol/L phenylphosphate.
Kinase preparations and assays. Kinase activities were assayed in
buffer A or C at 30jC at a final ATP concentration of 15 Amol/L. Blank
values were subtracted, and activities were expressed in percent of the
maximal activity, i.e., in the absence of inhibitors. Controls were done with
appropriate dilutions of DMSO.
CDK1/cyclin B (M phase starfish oocytes, native) and CDK5/p25
(human, recombinant) were prepared as previously described (10). Kinase
activity was assayed in buffer C, with 1 mg histone H1/mL, in the
presence of 15 Amol/L [g-33P] ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; 10 mCi/mL) in a final
volume of 30 AL. After 30 min incubation at 30jC, 25-AL aliquots of
supernatant were spotted onto 2.5  3-cm pieces of Whatman P81
phosphocellulose paper, and 20 s later, the filters were washed five times
( for at least 5 min each time) in a solution of 10 mL phosphoric acid/L of
water. The wet filters were counted in the presence of 1 mL ACS
(Amersham) scintillation fluid.
CDK2/cyclin A (human, recombinant, expressed in insect cells) was
assayed as described for CDK1/cyclin B.
CDK9/cyclin T (human, recombinant, expressed in insect cells) was
assayed as for CDK1/cyclin B using a pRB fragment (amino acids 773–928;
3.5 Ag/assay) as substrate.
GSK-3a/b (porcine brain, native, affinity purified) was assayed as
described for CDK1, but in buffer A and using a GSK-3–specific substrate
(GS-1: YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQSpEDEEE; Sp stands for phosphorylated
serine; ref. 28).
CK1d/e (porcine brain, native, affinity purified) was assayed as described
for CDK1, but using the CK1-specific peptide substrate RRKHAAIGSpAYSITA (29).
ProQinase protein kinase assays. All protein kinases were expressed
in Sf9 insect cells as human recombinant glutathione S-transferase-fusion
proteins or His-tagged proteins by means of the baculovirus expression
system. Kinases were purified and assayed as described (28; Supplementary
Materials).

CO2. Drug treatments were done on exponentially growing cultures at the
indicated time and concentrations. Control experiments were carried out
using appropriate dilutions of DMSO. KMS-11, multiple myeloma adherent
cell line, and GBM, a multiform glioblastoma primary culture cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented, respectively, with 5% or 10% fetal
calf serum, 2 mmol/L glutamine, antibiotics (100 IU/mL penicillin and
100 Ag/mL streptomycin), and 10 Amol/L 2-h-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies). Cells were subcultured at confluency after dispersal with 0.025%
trypsin in 0.02% EDTA. Their survival was estimated by the neutral red
uptake assay.9
Cell death and cell viability assessments. Cell viability was determined
by measuring the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H -tetrazolium (MTS). Cell death was
determined by measuring the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity

detail (30).
Caspase assay. Caspase activity was measured by determining the
fluorescence released from the AcDEVDafc synthetic substrate after its
direct addition to the culture medium, detergent lysis, and incubation at
37j. This method is devised for a 96-multiwell plate format. It allows kinetic
determinations of caspase activation and the characterization of multiple
drugs simultaneously (30).
Electrophoresis and Western blotting. Cells were resuspended and

mice purchased from the U.S. National Cancer Institute, which were housed

in the animal facilities of the Georgetown University Division of
Comparative Medicine. Mice were injected s.c. into the right posterior
flank with 4  106 A4573 Ewing’s sarcoma cells in 100 AL of Matrigel
basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences). Once tumors reached a
mean volume of about 195 mm3, mice were randomized into two groups
(six animals per group), and treatment was initiated. One group was treated
with meriolin 3, dissolved in DMSO, and given as a single daily i.p. injection,
at a dose of 1 mg/kg, for either 5 days or two 5-day series with a 2-day break
in between. The control group received i.p. injections of DMSO following
an identical schedule. Tumor growth was followed for up to 4 weeks after
the first injection. Tumor volumes were calculated by the formula
V = (1/2)a  b 2, where a is the longest tumor axis, and b is the shortest
tumor axis. Whenever tumors reached the maximum volume allowed by
institutional tumor burden guidelines, animals were sacrificed by asphyxiation with CO2. Tumors were immediately excised from euthanized
animals and measured. Data are given as mean F SD. Statistical analysis
of differences between groups was done by a one-way ANOVA, followed by

of 2 or 5 mg/kg for two 5-day series with a 2-day break in between. The
control group received i.p. injections of DMSO/NaCl following an identical

Animals were autopsied, and organs were examined macroscopically.

Results
Meriolins inhibit protein kinases, with selectivity toward
CDKs. Both meridianins (11) and variolins (17, 22, 23) show
distinct antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities. These effects
may be correlated with their inhibitory activities toward CDKs and
other protein kinases (11, 23). The chemical similarity between
meridianins and variolins prompted us to synthesize an aza-indole
hybrid structure, which we designated as a meriolin (Fig. 1A).
Representatives of the three chemical families were initially tested
on six purified protein kinases (CDK1/cyclin B, CDK2/cyclin A,
CDK5/p25, CDK9/cyclin T, GSK-3a/h and CK1y/q; Table 1A).
The moderate activity of meridianins (11) was confirmed. Variolin
B was identified as a potent inhibitor of all CDKs and GSK-3,
whereas deoxyvariolin B was 5- to 10-fold less potent. Interestingly,
variolin B and deoxyvariolin B were very potent inhibitors of
CK1, in fact, more potent than all reported CK1 inhibitors (29).
Meriolins were very potent inhibitors of CDKs, GSK-3, and
CK1. CDK2 and CDK9 seemed to be particularly sensitive to
meriolins.
To evaluate their selectivity, we tested meriolin 3 and variolin B
on a selection of 30 kinases from the ProQinase selectivity panel

(Fig. 1B and C). The highest inhibitory activity of meriolin 3 was
mostly restricted to CDKs, CDK9 being particularly sensitive under
these conditions. Inhibitory activity was observed at higher doses
for other kinases (Fig. 1). In contrast, variolin B did not display such
a striking selectivity for CDKs, although CDK9 was also a good target.
Meriolin 3–CDK2/cyclin A and variolin B–CDK2/cyclin A
co-crystal structures. We next investigated the molecular mechanism of action of meriolin 3 and variolin B by co-crystallization
with pCDK2/cyclin A (Fig. 2). A full description of the co-crystal
structures and comparison with previously described CDK2/
inhibitors structures will be presented elsewhere.9 Meriolin and
variolin B both occupy the kinase ATP binding site located between
the smaller NH2-terminal and large COOH-terminal lobes (Fig. 2A).
Meriolin 3 makes two hydrogen bonds to the CDK2 backbone
within the hinge sequence that links the two lobes of the kinase: it
accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone nitrogen of Leu83 and
donates a hydrogen bond to the backbone oxygen of Glu81 (Fig. 2B).
In addition, meriolin 3 makes two hydrogen bonds with the side
chains of Lys33 and Glu51 (Fig. 2B).
Although variolin B and meriolin 3 share a substantial portion
of their scaffold, the two molecules are oriented differently within
the ATP binding cleft. Variolin B, like meriolin 3, makes two
equivalent hydrogen bonds with the CDK2 hinge and also interacts
with the side chain of Lys33 through its hydroxyl group. In addition,
two ordered water molecules (Fig. 2B, red stars) are discernible in the
variolin B–bound active site, and one interacts with Ile10 main chain
amine. However, the presence of a third ring fused to the variolin B
indole creates a planar structure that is too large to be accommodated at the back of the ATP binding site if variolin B were to adopt

to both inhibitors is flipped 180j between the two bound structures.

Meriolins induce apoptotic cell death. We next compared the
three families of compounds for their ability to induce cell death in
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells as measured with an MTS reduction
assay (Table 1A; Fig. 3A). Because MTS reduction is occasionally
observed under conditions in which cell death does not occur, we
also used an independent cell death assay, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay (Fig. 3B). Dose-response curves showed
that meriolins are more potent than variolin B in terms of the
concentration required to reduce cell survival (MTS reduction;
Table 1A; Fig. 3A) or in terms of cell death induction (LDH release;
Fig. 3B).
To confirm that the induction of cell death by meriolins was not a
specific property of SH-SY5Y cells, we tested meriolin 3 on different human cancer cell lines (Table 1B). A 48-h exposure induced a
dose-dependent reduction of cell survival in all cell lines. However,
normal human foreskin primary fibroblasts were much less sensitive.
Cell death induced by meriolins and variolin B was accompanied
by a dose-dependent release of cytochrome c (Fig. 3C) and

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

activation of effector caspases (Fig. 3D). Meriolins were more
potent than variolin B at triggering both cytochrome c release and
caspase activation.
We next analyzed the effects of meriolins 3 and 4 and variolin B
on the phosphorylation of various proteins at CDK-specific sites.
Although meriolins induced a modest reduction in Rb levels
(Supplementary Figure), they strongly and dose-dependently
reduced Rb phosphorylation at CDK4-specific sites (Ser249/Thr252;
ref. 32; Fig. 4A). PP1a phosphorylation by CDK1 at Thr320 is a
reported marker of CDK1 activity (33, 34). Meriolins were very
potent at inhibiting CDK1-specific Thr320 phosphorylation of PP1a
in a dose-dependent manner, whereas variolin B was only active
at the highest (1 Amol/L) concentration tested (Fig. 4B). RNA
polymerase II is phosphorylated by CDK9 on Ser2. Although only
meriolin 4 induced a modest reduction in RNA polymerase II level
(Supplementary Figure), all three compounds inhibited CDK9specific Ser2 phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4C). Meriolins were more active than

variolin B. We next tested the effects of the three compounds on
the level of the short-lived survival factor Mcl-1 (Fig. 4D). Western
blot analysis showed that meriolins induced an almost complete
disappearance of Mcl-1, whereas variolin B was essentially inactive.
In vivo antitumor activity of meriolin 3. A nude mouse tumor
xenograft model system (31) was used to evaluate the antitumor
effect of meriolin 3 in vivo. Results showed that as early as 3 days
after treatment initiation, meriolin 3 had slowed tumor growth by
about 54% (Fig. 5A). Five days later (day 14), when tumors in
control animals reached an average volume about 2,000 mm3, and
animals had to be sacrificed, tumors in meriolin 3–treated animals
had reached an average volume of only f700 mm3 (f65% tumor
growth inhibition). The inhibitory effect of meriolin 3 on tumor
growth was also manifested by the fact that tumors in meriolin
3–treated animals took an additional period of about 20 days to
reach the maximum volume allowed by institutional tumor burden
standards (Fig. 5A). We used a second nude mouse tumor xenograft
model to confirm these in vivo antitumor effects (Fig. 5B). LS174T
colorectal cells were injected in mice, and once small tumors were
established, animals were injected daily (2  5 days sequence) with
meriolin 3 at a final concentration of 2 or 5 mg/kg. At the end

of the experiment, meriolin 3 had induced 59% (5 mg/kg) or 40%
(2 mg/kg) inhibition of tumor growth (Fig. 5B).

Discussion
Compared with terrestrial microorganisms and plants, marine
organisms constitute a relatively untapped source of bioactive
molecules. In recent years, however, an exponentially growing
number of original structures derived from marine microorganisms, plants, and animals have been identified, some of which are
reaching clinical stages and progressing to the pharmaceutical
market (reviews in refs. 35–37).
We here report on meriolins, a family of kinase inhibitors
designed from two different classes of marine natural products, the
meridianins (Ascidian) and the variolins (Sponge). Meridianins had
been reported as modest and rather unselective kinase inhibitors
(11). Variolins have been extensively studied following the
discovery of their potent antiproliferative and cell death–inducing
properties. They are currently undergoing preclinical studies as
potential antitumor agents (PharmaMar). As this work was in
progress, variolin B and deoxyvariolin B were reported to inhibit

sarcoma xenografts established in mice resulted in tumor growth delay.
Xenografts established by s.c. inoculation of A4573 cells in nude mice were
grown to a mean volume of about 195 mm3. Animals carrying tumors were
randomized into two groups. One group (n = 6) was treated with meriolin 3 in
DMSO, given as single daily i.p. injections (arrowheads ), at a dose of 1 mg/kg,
for either 5 d or two 5-d series with a 2-d break in between. The control
group (n = 6) received i.p. injections of DMSO following identical schedules.
Results shown correspond to one of the experimental replicas using the two
5-d treatment schedule. B, Meriolin 3 treatment of LS174T colorectal carcinoma
xenografts established in mice resulted in tumor growth delay. Xenografts

Animals carrying tumors were randomized into three groups. Two groups (n = 5)
were treated with meriolin 3, given as single daily i.p. injections (arrowheads )

i.p. injections of carrier following identical schedules.

CDK1, CDK2, and, to a lesser extent, CDK7 (23). We have confirmed
these initial results and extended them to other CDKs and other
kinases. Two other significant targets of variolin B are GSK-3 and
CK1. In fact, variolin B is, to our knowledge, the most potent
inhibitor of CK1 reported thus far. Variolin B analogues might thus
be designed with high selectivity for CK1, a significant therapeutic
target in both Alzheimer’s disease (38) and cancer (39). When we
analyzed its overall selectivity on a wider range of kinases (Fig. 1C),
variolin seemed to act on many kinases, yet with preferred
specificity toward CDK9 and FLT3 (Fig. 1). In contrast, meriolins
seem to have clear target preference for CDKs, especially CDK2 and
CDK9. To gain a more exhaustive view of the targets of meriolins,
we are currently designing an affinity chromatography matrix

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

bearing immobilized meriolin to purify its interacting proteins
from cell and tissue extracts. This method has previously been
employed to identify purvalanol- (40) and roscovitine-binding
proteins (28) and should allow us to identify other potential kinase
and nonkinase targets of meriolins.
The determination of structures for CDK2/cyclin A in complex
with meriolin 3 and variolin B (Fig. 2) shed some light on the
mechanisms of action of these molecules on their CDK target.
Meriolins were initially designed by analogy to variolin B, and they
do indeed make similar interactions with CDK2, notably making
hydrogen bonds with Lys33, Glu81, and Leu83 within the ATP
binding site. However, the crystal structures revealed that the two
inhibitors adopt different orientations, resulting in the aza-indole
ring and the 2-aminopyrimidine ring shared by both compounds
occupying different binding sites (Fig. 2). A more detailed analysis
of these co-crystal structures will be published elsewhere.9
Using various meriolins, and various cell models, we investigated
the effects of meriolins on cell survival. Meriolins induced cell
death at submicromolar concentrations in all cell lines tested,
with the noticeable exception of normal fibroblasts, which were
rather resistant (Table 1B). The most active meriolins were 3-fold
more potent than variolin B (Table 1A). Extensive analysis of cell
death mechanisms revealed that meriolins, like variolin B, induce
classic apoptosis features, including the down-regulation of Mcl-1
(Fig. 4D), cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (Fig. 3C),
activation of effector caspases (Fig. 3D), and ultimately cell death
(LDH release, Fig. 3B).
The molecular mechanisms involved in meriolin-induced cell
death remain to be characterized. Although meriolins inhibit
CDK1 (Thr320 phosphorylation site on PP1a), CDK2 and CDK4
(Rb phosphorylation sites), we believe that CDK9 inhibition
(monitored by Ser2 phosphorylation on RNA polymerase II) constitutes the key event responsible for activation of the apoptotic
pathway. There is indeed growing evidence supporting the role of
CDK9 inhibition as an essential mechanism of action of CDK
inhibitors in their antitumor-inducing activities (refs. 41, 42;
reviewed in ref. 7). Inhibition of CDK9, a major regulator of RNA
polymerase II, is expected to lead to the down-regulation of RNA
polymerase II activity and, thus, to reduction in transcription. This
is expected to preferentially affect short-lived proteins. Mcl-1, an
antiapoptotic regulatory protein that couples cell survival to
apoptosis (reviewed in refs. 43, 44), is such a high-turnover protein
with an extremely short half-life (2–4 h). Through its ability to bind
to Bim, Bak, Bax, and other Bcl-2 family members, it neutralizes
these proapoptotic factors and thus acts as a key survival factor.
Mcl-1 expression is highly regulated both at the transcriptional
level (by transcription factors such as signal transducers and
activators of transcription 3, cAMP-responsive element binding
protein, PU.1) and at the translational level. Mcl-1 is also tightly
regulated at the post-translational level both by proteosomal
degradation following ubiquitinylation by MULE (45), an Mcl-1–
specific E3 ligase, and by phosphorylation. Indeed, Mcl-1 is phosphorylated at various sites, leading either to stabilization (Thr163
phosphorylation by Erk; ref. 46), destabilization (Ser159 phosphorylation by GSK-3; ref. 47), or enhanced binding to proapoptotic
factors Bim, Noxa, and Bak (Ser64 phosphorylation by CDK1, CDK2,
c-jun-NH2-kinase 1; ref. 48). Mcl-1 is highly expressed in tumor
cells, but either at low concentrations or not at all in normal cells.
Enhanced expression of Mcl-1 is observed in multiple cancers and
is associated with poor prognostic and, thus, constitutes a
significant anticancer drug target (reviewed in ref. 49).

Meriolins Inhibit CDKs

We propose that meriolins act through at least three mechanisms:
(a) by inhibiting CDK9, they transiently reduce both RNA polymerase
II level (Supplementary Figure) and activity (Fig. 4C) and, consequently, down-regulate Mcl-1 expression levels (Fig. 4D); (b) by
inhibiting CDK1, they reduce sequestering of proapoptotic factors by
Mcl-1; and (c) by inhibiting CDK1 and CDK2, they block cell cycle
progression both at the G1-S and G2-M transition, possibly leading to
E2F-1–dependent apoptosis (41). As a consequence of Mcl-1 reduction
and inhibition of its sink effects, proapoptotic regulators are liberated
and trigger cell death. This CDK1/CDK2/CDK9 inhibition mechanism
might be general for antitumor CDK inhibitors that are developed for
clinical use against cancers (7, 41, 42).
Our results showed that meriolin 3 has potent antitumor activity.
The A4573 Ewing’s tumor xenograft model has been used
previously to test the antitumor activity of roscovitine, another
CDK inhibitor (31). In this regard, it seems that, in this xenograft
model system with the same type of treatment schedule, meriolin 3
is a more potent inhibitor of tumor growth than roscovitine.
At the time control animals had to be sacrificed to follow institutional tumor burden guidelines, roscovitine had caused an
f85% inhibition of tumor growth (39), whereas meriolin 3 had an
f65% inhibition. However, it is important to point out that
roscovitine was used at a concentration 50-fold higher than that of
meriolin 3 (50 mg/kg versus 1 mg/kg, respectively), indicating that
meriolin 3 is still f40-fold more efficient at inhibiting the growth

of Ewing’s sarcoma xenografts and strongly suggesting that
meriolin 3 may be an effective cancer therapeutic agent. Similar
promising in vivo antitumor effects were observed with low
concentrations of meriolin 3 using LS174T colorectal carcinoma in
nude mice. These experiments are only exploratory; meriolins need
to be optimized, and their administration needs to be explored
further with respect to dosing, timing, and combination with other
drugs. Nevertheless, this family of small-molecular-weight compounds, derived from marine natural products, as pharmacologic
inhibitors of CDKs, display promising antitumor activity that
requires further studies.
