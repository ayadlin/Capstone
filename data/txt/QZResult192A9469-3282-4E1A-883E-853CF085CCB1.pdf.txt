BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis is extremely poor. This phase 2 study evaluated the benefits and tolerability of weekly intravenous and intraperitoneal paclitaxel (PTX) treatment combined with oral S-1 in
patients with gastric cancer who had macroscopic peritoneal metastasis. METHODS: Patients with gastric cancer who had primary
tumors with macroscopic peritoneal metastasis were enrolled. PTX was administered intravenously at 50 mg/m2 and intraperitoneally
at 20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, respectively. S-1 was administered at 80 mg/m2 per day for 14 consecutive days, followed by 7 days of
rest. The primary endpoint was the 1-year overall survival (OS) rate. The secondary endpoints were the response rate, efficacy against
malignant ascites, and safety. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were enrolled. The median number of treatment courses was 11 (range, 235). The 1-year OS rate was 77.1% (95% confidence interval, 60.5-88.1). The overall response rate was 71% in 7 patients with target
lesions. Malignant ascites disappeared or decreased in 15 of 22 (68%) patients. The frequent grade 3/4 toxic effects were neutropenia
(34%), leukopenia (23%), and anemia (9%). CONCLUSIONS: Combination chemotherapy consisting of intravenous and intraperitoneal
PTX with S-1 is well-tolerated and effective in patients with gastric cancer who have macroscopic peritoneal metastasis. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.1 Multimodal therapy combined with systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery has been developed in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.2 Even for noncurable gastric cancer, many clinical trials have been conducted using
various newly developed anticancer drugs. In a phase 3 study using docetaxel (DTX), cisplatin, and fluorouracil for recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer patients, the 1-year overall survival (OS) rate and median survival time (MST) were 40%
and 9.2 months, respectively.3 In another phase 3 study using S-1 and cisplatin for unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer,
the 1-year OS rate and MST were 54.1% and 13.0 months, respectively.4
Among patients with noncurable gastric cancer, the prognosis of patients with peritoneal metastasis is extremely
poor,5 and no standard treatment for peritoneal metastasis has been established.
One potential treatment approach is the introduction of paclitaxel (PTX), which has been shown to produce a high
response rate (29%-36%) for undifferentiated-type adenocarcinoma6,7 and can be expected to show high efficacy for peritoneal dissemination. The intraperitoneal (IP) administration of PTX was developed to reinforce the drugâ€™s effect on peritoneal metastasis. This would be accomplished by making the drug act directly on the nodules at a high concentration. In
fact, IP administration of PTX has been used together with systemic chemotherapy for the peritoneal dissemination of
ovarian cancer, which has shown significant survival benefits.8 These results inspired us to use IP PTX for peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer, and therefore we designed a study involving IP and intravenous (IV) PTX combined with oral S1 chemotherapy. The phase 1 study determined the optimum dose9 of IP PTX to be 20 mg/m2. We then conducted a
phase 2 study in 40 patients with gastric cancer who had peritoneal metastasis, which showed a 1-year OS rate of 78% and
MST of 23.6 months.10 In this previous study, however, 6 patients with gastric cancer who had positive peritoneal wash-

ing cytology but negative macroscopic peritoneal disseminated nodules (Cy1 P0) were included. In the current
study, therefore, we identified peritoneal metastasis macroscopically with investigative laparoscopy and reevaluated the efficacy and tolerability of the same regimen
(weekly IV and IP PTX combined with oral S-1) for
patients with apparent peritoneal metastasis (P1).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility

The eligibility criteria were as follows: 1) histologically
proven unresectable or recurrent gastric adenocarcinoma;
2) peritoneal dissemination diagnosed by staging laparoscopy or computed tomography (CT); 3) age > 20 years;
4) performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group) of 0 to 2; 5) adequate bone marrow function (leukocyte count, 3000-12,000/mm3); 6) hemoglobin, > 8.0
g/dL and platelet count > 100,000/mm3; 7) adequate
liver function (total serum bilirubin level < 2.0 mg/dL
and serum transaminases < 100/UI); 8) adequate renal
function (serum creatinine level within the upper limit of
the normal range); 9) an expected survival period of > 3
months; 10) the absence of metastasis to distant organ
sites (liver, lungs, or bone) except the ovary; and 11) no
other active concomitant malignancies or other severe
medical conditions. Patients who had previously received
chemotherapy were also eligible. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. This study was carried
out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and
was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Tokyo. This study was registered in the UMIN
Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000002850).
Treatment

Patients newly diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer
underwent staging laparoscopy and were enrolled in this
study when peritoneal dissemination was confirmed. Palliative gastrectomies were performed when patients had
gastric bleeding or obstruction due to tumors, but noncurative gastrectomy for tumor reduction was not performed. A peritoneal access port was implanted in the
subcutaneous space of the lower abdomen, with a catheter
placed in the pelvic cavity. The Peritoneal Cancer Index
(PCI), which quantitatively combines the distribution of
intraperitoneal tumors,11 was determined at the time of
the staging laparoscopy.
S-1 was administered orally twice daily at a dose of
80 mg/m2 per day for 14 consecutive days, followed by
7 days of rest. PTX was administered IV at a dose of 50
mg/m2 and IP at a dose of 20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8,

respectively. PTX was diluted in 1 L normal saline and
administered through the implanted peritoneal access
port over 1 hour concurrent with IV infusion following
standard premedication. The treatment course was
repeated every 3 weeks until observation of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Gastrectomy for cytoreduction was performed when peritoneal washing cytology
was negative, and second-look laparoscopic examination
revealed peritoneal metastatic nodules disappeared or
decreased in number and size in response to chemotherapy.
Assessment of Response and Toxicity

The primary endpoint was the 1-year OS rate. Secondary
endpoints were the overall response rate, efficacy against
malignant ascites, and safety. The 1-year OS rate was estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Overall survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Prior to
each course of treatment, a medical history, physical examination, laboratory studies (blood cell count, electrolytes,
liver and renal function tests, and urinalysis), and chest radiography were performed. Gastroendoscopy, upper gastrointestinal radiography, and CT were conducted in order to
define the extent of disease and response. Tumor responses
were evaluated after every 3 courses of treatment and categorized based on the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors) guidelines. The amount of malignant ascites and peritoneal cytology were also taken into account
to assess the antitumor effects. In accordance with the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma,12 the amount
of ascites was assessed by radiologists, using CT. At the first
day of each treatment course, ascites or peritoneal lavage
fluid was collected through a peritoneal access port and
cytologic analysis was carried out. Toxicity was graded
according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.
Statistical Methods

Because a standard treatment for gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis has not been established, a threshold for
the 1-year OS rate was determined to be 54% due to the
result of phase 3 clinical trials in unresectable or recurrent
gastric cancer with systemic administration of S-1 and cisplatin.4 The expected 1-year OS rate was 74%, based on
our previously reported phase 2 study.10 We assumed a
null hypothesis of 54% and an alternative hypothesis of
74%, with 1-sided, type I error of 0.05 and power of 0.8,
with an accrual time of 2 years, and follow-up of 0.5 years after closure of recruitment. With these specifications, enrollment was deemed necessary in 27 patients, according to the
Southwest Oncology Group One-Arm Survival program.

RESULTS
From December 2009 to November 2010, a total of 35
patients were enrolled in this study and were fully evaluated for OS and toxicity. Seven patients with measurable
target lesions were assessed for overall response rate. PCI
scores were obtained for 32 patients who underwent staging laparoscopy in our institution. Patient characteristics
are listed in Table 1.
OS and Response

Because the actual accrual time was 11 months, more than
1 year shorter than expected, the follow-up period was
prolonged from 0.5 to 1.5 years.
A median of 11 courses of treatment were performed, with a range of 2 to 35 courses. Combination
chemotherapy was discontinued because of disease progression in 23 cases and severe adverse events in 5 cases.
Gastrectomy with lymph node dissection as cytoreductive
surgery was performed in 21 patients. Total gastrectomy
was performed in 20 cases and distal gastrectomy in one
case. Ovary with metastasis was resected in 2 cases, and
the large intestine and small intestine with stenosis due to
peritoneal metastasis were resected in 4 and 2 cases,
respectively. Peritonectomy was not performed in any
case. Figure 1 shows the OS time after the introduction of
combination chemotherapy for all 35 patients enrolled in
this study. The 1-year OS rate was 77.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60.5%-88.1%), whereas the 2-year
OS rate was 44.8% (95% CI, 29.1%-61.6%) at a median
follow-up time of 18.0 months. The MST was 17.6
months (95% CI, 13.4 months to not-reached). As shown
in Figure 2, the 9 patients with PCI scores  20 had a
lower survival rate than did the 23 patients with PCI
scores < 20 (MST, 13.4 months versus not-reached);
however, the difference in survival between the 2 groups
was not statistically significant (P 5 .13).
Tumor responses are summarized in Table 2. Only
7 patients had measurable disease as shown by RECIST
criteria, but 5 of these (71%) showed objective response.
Malignant ascites disappeared or decreased in 15 (68%)
of 22 patients. Peritoneal cytology turned to negative in
28 (97%) of 29 patients.
Safety

Adverse events are listed in Table 3. The frequent grade
3/4 toxic effects included neutropenia (34%), leukopenia
(23%), and anemia (9%). Complications related to the
peritoneal access device consisted of obstruction of the IP
catheter in 3 patients and infection of the access port in 3
patients. None of the patients experienced abdominal

Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier plot is shown for overall survival,
stratified according to peritoneal cancer index (PCI) scores

in our institution from 1978 to 2005, before IP chemotherapy was introduced, revealed that the 1-year OS rate
and MST of 46 patients with gastric cancer who had distant metastasis only in the peritoneum were 32.9% and
9.3 months, respectively. Compared with our historical
survival data, the patients enrolled in this study were considered to have favorable prognoses.
In this study, only patients with macroscopic peritoneal disseminated metastases (P1) were selected, whereas
in the previously reported phase 2 study, 6 patients with
positive peritoneal washing cytology but negative macroscopic peritoneal disseminated nodules (Cy1 P0) were also
selected in addition to 34 P1 patients.10 The 1- and 2-year
OS rates of the current trial were 77.1% and 44.8%,
respectively; the values were almost identical to those
found in the previously reported study. This indicates that
repeated IP administration of PTX permits direct interaction of the drug with the peritoneal disseminated nodules
as well as free cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity, achieving
significant effectiveness for both microscopic and macroscopic peritoneal metastasis.

When PTX is IP administered, after being dissolved
in polyethoxylated castor oil, it is absorbed slowly because
of its high molecular weight and lipophilic property.13
The IP-administered anticancer drug directly exposes the
disseminated cancer nodules in the peritoneal cavity to
drug infiltration.14 We demonstrated in a mouse model
that IP-administered PTX infiltrates approximately at
least 100 to 200 lm from the surface of the disseminated
tumor within 24 hours.15,16 In contrast, even if anticancer
drugs are IV administered, most of them cannot cross
the peritoneum-serum barrier and, therefore, cannot
adequately reach the disseminated nodule.17
Repetition of IP PTX administration through the
implanted peritoneal access port was considered to be one
of the factors contributing to the favorable survival results
of this study. The median number of IP administrations
in this study was 22. Although IP-administered PTX penetrates only approximately 100 to 200 lm from the surface of the disseminated tumor, repetitive and direct
exposure of PTX to the surface of the tumor nodules
might induce extensive tumor reduction.
However, the effectiveness of IP chemotherapy may
be reduced by the presence of large amounts of IP tumors.
This is apparent because patients with massive peritoneal
metastasis had a tendency to have a lower survival rate
than did those with relatively small amounts of peritoneal
metastasis (Fig. 2).
Yonemura et al reported bidirectional neoadjuvant
chemotherapy in 79 patients with gastric cancer with macroscopic and/or microscopic peritoneal metastasis.18 The
patients were treated with oral S-1 and IP administration
of DTX and cisplatin. The 1-year OS rate and MST were
67.4% and 15.0 months, respectively, in the 41 patients
3357

who received cytoreductive surgery after chemotherapy.
Fujiwara et al reported that 2 cycles of IP chemotherapy
with DTX combined with S-1 were administrated in 18
patients with gastric cancer who had macroscopic and/or
microscopic peritoneal metastasis.19 Gastrectomy was
performed in 16 patients after chemotherapy. The 1-year
OS rate and MST were 76% and 24.6 months, respectively. Because DTX is known to show kinetics after IP
administration similar to that of PTX, these results suggest that DTX is another promising agent for IP
chemotherapy.
The main toxicities of this chemotherapy regimen
were neutropenia and leukopenia. Nonhematological
toxic effects were relatively mild and were similar to those
reported in a previous study.10
In conclusion, S-1 combined with IP and IV administration of PTX chemotherapy is safe and effective for
treatment of gastric cancer with macroscopic peritoneal
metastasis. Further validation of IP chemotherapy for gastric peritoneal metastasis will be determined in the
randomized phase 3 clinical trial (the Phoenix-gc trial)
that started in November 2011.
