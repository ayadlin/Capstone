ABSTRACT
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, therapeutic response to sorafenib was not
equal among HCC patients. Here we present a novel system to provide quantitative
information concerning sorafenib-related targets by simultaneous detection of
phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and pAkt expressions in circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
isolated from HCC patients. Our results showed that 90.0% of patients had a molecular
classification of tissues concordant with that of CTCs. CTC counts showed a shaper
decline in patients with pERK+/pAkt− CTCs after two weeks of sorafenib treatment
(P < 0.01). Disease control rates were significantly different between patients with
pERK+/pAkt− CTCs (11/15; 73.3%) and those without (13/44; 29.5%) (P < 0.05).
Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated pERK+/pAkt− CTCs as an independent
predictive factor of progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio = 9.389; P < 0.01).
PFS correlated with the proportion of pERK+/pAkt− CTCs (r = 0.968, P < 0.01), and
was higher in patients with ≥ 40% pERK+/pAkt− CTCs compared to those with < 40%
(8.4 vs. 1.3 mo; P < 0.05). In a validation set of twenty HCC patients, CTCs from patients
with ≥ 40% pERK+/pAkt− CTCs had significantly higher inhibition rates of spheroid
formation compared to those with < 40% (61.2 vs. 19.8%; P < 0.01). Our findings
demonstrated that CTCs can be used in place of tumor tissue for characterization of
pERK/pAkt expression. pERK+/pAkt− CTCs are most sensitive to sorafenib and an
independent predictive factor of PFS in HCC patients treated with sorafenib.

survival of patients with advanced HCC [4–6]. However,
the response rate of sorafenib is quite low, and not all
patients respond equally well to sorafenib treatment
[4, 5], for reasons that are not entirely clear.
A variety of studies have shown that the inactivation
of Ras/Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
pathway and the activation of the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in tumors play a critical
role in the resistance to sorafenib [7–14]. Thus, these
pathways may provide biomarkers to assess sorafenibresistance before and throughout the course of treatment.
Currently, tumor tissues obtained by an excisional
or needle biopsy are used for detection of drug targets.
However, needle aspiration often fails to locate

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
most common malignancies worldwide, for which the
prognosis remains poor, particularly for those with
advanced disease [1]. The recent approval of sorafenib as
the first effective oral drug for HCC marks a significant
milestone in the treatment of this disease [2]. Sorafenib is
a multitargeted, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor
with multiple antitumor effects, including antiangiogenic,
antiproliferative, and pro-apoptotic effects via inhibition of
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, -2
and -3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)
β, Raf-1, B-Raf, and C-Raf [3]. Large randomized phase
III studies indicate that sorafenib treatment improves the

measurable objectives or obtain sufficient tumor samples,
and only a small proportion of patients are eligible for
surgical excision at diagnosis. Furthermore, invasive
sampling is potentially harmful and expensive, and cannot
be performed repeatedly. The collection of circulating
tumor cells (CTCs) provides a viable alternative. CTCs
are cancer cells shed from either the primary tumor or its
metastases that circulate in the peripheral blood, which
thus are available noninvasively and can be obtained
repeatedly for a readily accessible real-time “liquid
biopsy” of tumors [15]. Molecular characterization of
CTCs has been used in the development of personalized
targeted therapies in breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal
cancer [16–21]. It is worth noting that there have been
a considerable number of studies which investigated
phospho-proteins expressed in CTCs and revealed their
biological significance, such as pAkt [22], pSRC [23],
pEGFR [24, 25], pFAK and pPI3K [26]. Also, pAkt and
pERK have been widely studied in HCC tissues over a
period of years [7–14, 27]. Thus, we utilized CTCs to
evaluate the activation (phosphorylation) of ERK and Akt
with sorafenib for treatment of HCC, and to determine if
pERK/pAkt phenotyping of CTCs can be used as a viable
diagnostic biomarker for sorafenib efficacy.

phenotype patterns of pERK/pAkt expression were
observed in tissue specimens (Fig. 1D). The molecular
classification based on analysis of both tumor tissues and
CTCs in 32 patients is summarized in Table 1. CTCs were
detected in 30/32 patients from whom tissue specimens
were obtained, and molecular classification of CTC and
tissue was concordant in 27/30 (90.0%) patients.

Distribution and percentage of pERK/pAkt
phenotypes in CTCs
The molecular classification of all 101 patients with
HCC that were categorized according to pERK or pAkt
positivity in CTCs is presented in Table 2. The distribution
and percentage of CTC phenotypes varied among
individuals, even individuals within the same subset, and
multiple phenotypes could be found within an individual.

Sorafenib response correlates with pERK+/pAkt−
CTCs in HCC Patients
A total of 64 patients received sorafenib monotherapy,
which was interrupted in five due to intolerable adverse
reactions, including hand-foot syndrome (n = 2), diarrhea
(n = 2), and vomiting (n = 1). Therefore, 59 patients were
included in evaluation of sorafenib efficacy. All patients
suffered varying rates of decline in CTC counts after two
weeks of treatment, from 56 ± 20 to 41 ± 18 CTCs/5 mL of
blood. Pretreatment percentages of different CTC subtypes
in at least one patient randomly selected from each subgroup
with varied CTCs subtypes are shown in Fig. 2A. As
shown in Fig. 2B, pERK+/pAkt− (n = 2) and pERK+/pAkt+
(n = 9) classified patients suffered a severe decrease
in CTC counts; and particularly patients with pERK+/
pAkt− CTCs (n = 8). CTC counts pre- and post-treatment
with sorafenib in each subset of patients were listed in
Supplementary Table S2. Further analysis indicated that
the decline in CTC counts in patients with pERK+/pAkt−
CTCs (n = 15) was 53.0 ± 17.1% (range: 30.2–83.3%),
which was significantly higher than in those without
(n = 44), for whom CTC counts declined 17.9 ± 6.7%
(range: 3.4–32.6%) (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2C).
In all 59 patients, the decline in pERK+/pAkt− CTCs
(78.7 ± 8.9%) was significantly greater than in pERK+/
pAkt+ (16.9 ± 8.7%), pERK-/pAkt+ (17.6 ± 14.2%), and
pERK-/pAkt− (20.5 ± 17.3%) CTCs (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2D).
mRECIST evaluation revealed no significant
correlations of tumor response with clinical characteristics
(Table 3). CR, PR, SD, and PD was observed in 1/59
(1.7%), 11/59 (18.6%), 12/59 (20.3%) and 35/59
(59.3%) patients, respectively, resulting in a total DCR of
40.7%. The decline in CTC counts in patients with DCR
(n = 24) was 39.5 ± 21.4% (range: 17.5–83.3%), which
was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than 18.2 ± 9.1%
(range: 3.4–42.1%) in patients with PD (n = 35). In the
patients with pERK+/pAkt− CTCs, the DCR was 73.3%,

RESULTS
Classification of HCC patients via pERK/pAkt
expression patterns in CTCs
CTC counts ranged from 0–137 per 5 mL of blood, and
were detected in 101/109 (92.7%) patients with advanced
HCC (52 ± 23 CTCs/5 mL). Immunofluorescence staining
revealed specific and heterogeneous cytoplasmic expression
of pERK and pAkt in CTCs (Fig. 1A); 25/101 (24.8%)
patients had pERK+ CTCs, and 81/101 (80.2%) had pAkt+
CTCs. Generally, CTCs with various patterns of pERK/pAkt
expression were found within blood samples from the same
patient (Fig. 1B), some of which even contained all four
possible phenotypes (pERK+/pAkt+, pERK+/pAkt−, pERK−/
pAkt+, and pERK−/pAkt−). Patients were defined as pERK
or pAkt positive based on the presence of pERK+ or pAkt+
CTCs, and then classified into four subsets according to the
combination of pERK and pAkt positivity (Supplementary
Table S1).

Concordance of pERK/pAkt expression in CTCs
and tumor tissues
pERK and pAkt were detected in tumor tissue
specimens, but the expression was not uniform throughout
(Fig. 1C). According to positivity-defining criteria as
previously described [9], 7/32 (21.9%) tumors were
classified as pERK+ and 27/32 (84.4%) were pAkt+,
which were similar to the 24.8% and 80.2%, respectively,
determined from CTC analyses. In addition, all four

(P = 0.003). Further analysis showed no significant
positive correlation of tumor response with CTC
phenotypes other than pERK+/pAkt− CTCs (Table 3).

for 8 mo, these tumors were shrunken or had completely
disappeared as evidenced by dynamic contrast-enhanced
MRI (Fig. 3A).

Proportion of pERK+/pAkt- CTCs as a potential
predictive factor of HCC patients treated with

correlated with the proportion of CTCs identified as pERK+/
pAkt− (r = 0.968; P < 0.01), but not with the number of
pERK+/pAkt- CTCs (r = 0.491). Moreover, patients with
a ≥ 40% proportion of pERK+/pAkt- CTCs (n = 10) had a
longer PFS than those with < 40% (n = 49) (Fig. 3B, 3C),
which was confirmed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and logrank test (median PFS: 8.4 [95% CI: 4.8–12.0] vs. 1.3
[95% CI: 1.2–1.4] mo) (Fig. 3D).

Univariate analysis of predictive factors for PFS
indicated that pERK+/pAkt− CTCs but not other types of
CTCs was significantly associated with PFS (Table 4).
The multivariate analysis using both significant and nearsignificant variables (up to P = 0.1 in the univariate analysis)
showed that pERK+/pAkt− CTCs remained an independent
factor associated with a good prognosis (hazard ratio = 9.389,
P < 0.01). CTC phenotypes and PFS for 15 patients with
pERK+/pAkt− CTCs are listed in Supplementary Table S3.

However, samples comprised of ≥ 40% pERK+/pAkt−

DISCUSSION
Several studies have attempted to utilize serum
biomarkers to predict response to sorafenib. Ten plasma
biomarkers were prospectively evaluated in the SHARP
trial, but failed to predict response to sorafenib [28].

Note: a53 was the median number of CTCs detected in 59 HCC patients.
Miyahara et al [29] analyzed nine serum cytokines in
30 HCC patients treated with sorafenib and observed that
high levels of serum cytokines at baseline correlated with
poor treatment response. However, the treatment response
deteriorated as the number of cytokines at a high level
increased. Disease progression was only seen in 25%
patients with 0–2 high biomarkers and 33.3% with 3–5. Two
recent independent studies by Gyöngyösi et al [30] and Vaira
et al [31] suggested that microRNAs in HCC tissues could
be used to assess expected survival of patients treated with
sorafenib. The prognostic impact of microRNAs in response
to sorafenib may be non-specific, as bioinformatics analysis
did not identify any interaction between the microRNA gene
targets and sorafenib activity or metabolism [31]. Other
molecular markers such as Mcl-1 [32] and CD44 [33] may
also have similar impact on response to sorafenib.
Although inhibition of VEGFR- or PDGFRregulated intracellular kinase pathways in endothelial
cells or pericytes is only one of multiple mechanisms of
sorafenib action, expression levels of these growth factors
or relevant receptors in HCC tissues have been evaluated
to predict the clinical outcome of patients receiving
sorafenib [34–39]. Moreover, a few studies have evaluated
pERK expression before treatment in tissue biopsies or
cell lines and found a positive correlation with a more
favorable response to sorafenib [7, 8, 27].
Our results show concordance between CTCs and
tumor tissues regarding pERK/pAkt phenotype status,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with expression in CTCs similar to those reported in
liver cancer tissues [7–14]. These data led us to believe
that it is necessary to conduct target detection before the
administration of sorafenib, and CTCs represent an effective,
noninvasive method to collect samples. pERK/pAkt
phenotyping in individual CTCs eliminates the interference
from a large number of various components in the tissue, and
more accurately reflects the true nature of a tumor. Analysis
of CTCs provides comprehensive details concerning the
specific phenotypes expressed and their proportions, which
is unachievable when tumor tissues are used for detection.
We further investigated whether such quantitative
information could be used to predict response to sorafenib in
patients with HCC to personalize this therapeutic approach.
All patients showed a decrease in CTC counts after two
weeks of sorafenib monotherapy. The greatest decrease
occurred in patients with a high proportion of pERK+/pAkt−
CTCs, suggesting that this phenotype is most sensitive to
sorafenib, and likely the reason for the clinical efficacy
of sorafenib treatment. The slight decrease in other CTC
phenotypes probably resulted from a tumor burden reduction
by antiangiogenic or other mechanisms of sorafenib.
As HCC is a hypervascular cancer, it was theorized
that the efficacy of sorafenib is primarily attributable to its
inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by targeting VEGFR and
PDGFR, and partly to the inhibition of Raf [40]. Indeed,
several angiogenesis inhibitors (sunitinib, linifanib and
brivanib) targeting similar pathways have been compared

with sorafenib in Phase III trials, however these drugs
failed to demonstrate superior efficacy in patients with HCC
compared with the standard treatment [41–44]. Notably,
a study in an orthotopic HCC mouse model demonstrated
that sorafenib had a pro-metastasis effect in HCC through
downregulation of tumor suppressor HTATIP2, which is
associated with inhibition of angiogenesis [45]. Therefore,
we speculate that targeting HCC cells by inhibiting the
Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway, rather than targeting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

endothelial cells by inhibiting angiogenesis, is probably the
primary contribution to the anti-tumor efficacy of sorafenib.
Moreover, the resistance to sorafenib determined by specific
molecular features of HCC cells in most patients will
decrease its overall clinical efficacy, as shown by our study
and others [4, 5, 7–13].
Importantly, our study demonstrates that therapeutic
response to sorafenib, as well as PFS, only correlate with
the proportion of pERK+/pAkt− CTCs, particularly when the

proportion is ≥ 40%. This result was somewhat inconsistent
with the present knowledge of CTCs, which indicates that
patients with a higher CTC count have a higher tumor
burden, higher tumor stage, and demonstrate poorer
therapeutic efficacy. However, our data are supported by the
observation that sorafenib significantly inhibited spheroid
formation of pERK+/pAkt− CTCs. Previous reports have
shown that overall survival is paradoxically prolonged for
patients who receive a half-dose of sorafenib for 70% of
the treatment period compared to those who maintained full
dosing or had a dose reduced for < 70% of the treatment
period [4, 46]. It is possible that the cumulative dose was
increased in patients who underwent a dose reduction
due to fewer side effects, better tolerance, and prolonged
treatment exposure. Indeed, in the study by Iavarone et al
[46] the dose of sorafenib was only reduced as required by
intolerance or side effects, which typically denote better
susceptibility to the drug. Thus, the efficacy of a drug could
be higher in a patient that experiences side effects, regardless
of dose reduction. This implies that targeted drugs may not
follow the therapeutic paradigm of cytotoxic anticancer
drugs, for which clinical activity correlates with dosing and
achievement of clinically effective blood levels [47]. This
may also explain why sorafenib response did not correlate
with clinical characteristics or total CTC count in our study.
The response was mainly dependent on inherent sensitivity
or resistance to sorafenib. On the other hand, a higher
number but a lower percentage of pERK+/pAkt− CTCs in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a single patient indicates that more tumor cells are resistant
to sorafenib, thus generating poor clinical effectiveness,
whereas a patient with a low number but higher percentage
of pERK+/pAkt− CTCs may achieve a better outcome after
sorafenib treatment.
In summary, this study presents a unique platform
to provide quantitative information concerning sorafenibrelated targets in CTCs, define the molecular subtypes of
HCC to identify patients particularly susceptible to sorafenib,
predict drug response and efficacy, and select patients most
likely to benefit. Thus, CTC pERK/pAkt phenotyping will
ultimately increase the success of sorafenib treatment, while
preventing unnecessary treatments, serious side effects, and
high costs. However, further large-scale clinical prospective
investigations are needed to confirm and verify the clinical
significance indicated by our study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and sample collection
The study enrolled 109 patients with advanced
HCC who were candidates for sorafenib treatment,
including newly diagnosed patients (n = 50) and patients
with recurrent HCC after surgical resection, transcatheter
arterial chemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation
(n = 59). Clinical characteristics of all patients are
presented in Supplementary Table S4. Serial tissue

Immunohistochemistry

sections were obtained from 32 patients who underwent
surgical resection. Peripheral blood (5 mL) was collected
in polyethylene tubes containing EDTA (Greiner BioOne GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) after discarding
the first 5 mL of blood. The study was approved by the
Biomedical Ethics Committee of Eastern Hepatobiliary
Surgery Hospital (Shanghai, China) and informed written
consent was obtained from all patients.

Serial tissue sections were incubated with either
mouse anti-human pAkt1/2/3 (1:100 dilution, Thr308/
Thr309/Thr305; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX,
USA) or rabbit anti-human pERK1/2 (1:200 dilution,
Thr202/Tyr204; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA, USA) monoclonal antibody at 4°C overnight, and

then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody (Maixin-Bio, Fuzhou, China) at
room temperature for 45 min. The immunoreactivity was
visualized using diaminobenzidine substrate (MaixinBio). The positivity was determined independently by
three liver pathologists considering both intensity and
subcellular localization as reported (9).

30 min at 37°C. Then, 500 μL of DMEM with sorafenib
was added on top of the gel to give a final concentration of
10 μM sorafenib in 0.4% DMSO. The final concentration
was estimated by sorafenib sensitivity tests for HCC cell
lines to be the optimal concentration. Spheroid formation
was observed every day and counted on day 7. A spheroid
was defined as 3D cell structure > 100 μm in diameter.

CTC enrichment and multicolor
immunofluorescence staining

Sorafenib treatment
The final clinical decision for sorafenib treatment, and
as a monotherapy or combined, was made by physicians
blind to the CTC detection results. Patient inclusion
criteria included: proven diagnosis either by histological or
characteristic radiologic or serologic findings; ineligibility
for or progression after surgical resection; Child-Pugh liver
function class A or B; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status 0–2; adequate hematological
functions (white blood cells > 4 × 109/L or absolute
neutrophil count > 1.5 × 109/L, platelets > 100 × 109/L,
hemoglobin > 10 g/dL); and preserved organ functions
(serum creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dL, serum alanine and
aspartate aminotransferase levels < 5 times the upper limit of
the normal range). An initial dose of 400 mg sorafenib b.i.d.
(Nexavar; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Leverkusen,
Germany) was administered, and treatment was interrupted
or dosage was reduced for drug-related adverse effects.
Sorafenib administration was continued until intolerable
toxicity or disease progression occurred.

CTC enrichment of whole blood samples was
conducted according to the method previously described
[48]. Briefly, following density gradient centrifugation,
CTCs were enriched by extracting CD45-expressing
leukocytes with magnetically labeled anti-CD45
monoclonal antibody according to the instructions. The
remaining cells were cytocentrifuged on polylysine-coated
slides. Slides prepared from blood samples were coincubated with pAkt1/2/3 and pERK1/2 antibody at 37°C
for 1 h, followed by Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat antimouse and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody
(1:500 dilution, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Slides were
subsequently stained with Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated
pan-cytokeratin (P-CK) mouse monoclonal antibody
(1:50 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology) and costained
with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). As controls,
slides prepared with PLC/PRF/5, Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7,
MHCC-97H and -97L HCC cell lines were stained with
primary antibodies or isotype control antibodies according
to the method previously described [48].

Outcomes and assessments
A total of 59 patients were included for efficacy
assessments. An additional 5 mL sample of peripheral blood
was collected two weeks after sorafenib administration and
processed as described above. Tumor sizes were measured at
baseline and every 4–8 weeks during treatment by dynamic
contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Response to sorafenib
in patients was evaluated using the modified Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) and
classified as complete response (CR), partial response (PR),
stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). Disease
control rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of cases
showing CR, PR, or SD. Progression-free survival (PFS)
was calculated as the time from the first cycle of sorafenib to
radiologic or serologic progression or death from any cause.
Survival was censored if a change in therapy occurred.

Identification and enumeration of CTCs with
different phenotypes
Stained slides were viewed through a fluorescence
microscope (IX71; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and images
were captured from positively stained CTCs and control
slides with the same gain and exposure time. P-CK
and DAPI-stained cells that met morphologic features
of malignant cells (large cellular size, high nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratio, and visible nucleoli) were scored as
CTCs. pAkt1/2/3 and pERK1/2 expression was examined
in P-CK-positive CTCs. Cell counts are expressed as the
number of cells per 5 mL of blood.

Sorafenib-sensitivity testing

Statistical analysis

The sensitivity of CTCs to sorafenib was assessed
using a three-dimensional (3D) cancer model for drug
evaluation that mimics in vivo responses to drugs [49].
Briefly, CTCs isolated from 5 mL peripheral blood were
resuspended in 150 μL DMEM containing sorafenib predissolved in DMSO. Matrigel (Becton, Dickinson, and
Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was thawed and
mixed equally with the CTC-containing DMEM. The
prepared mixture was then incubated in a 24-well plate for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
software (version 17.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and a
two-sided P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Comparison of categorical variables was performed using
the χ2 test. Independent predictive significance of risk factors
identified by univariate analysis was computed by the Cox
regression model. Spearman rank correlation analysis was
2656

Oncotarget

used for nonparametric correlations. The progression-free
survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and
comparison of survival rates among groups was conducted
using the log-rank test. Data are expressed as mean ±
standard deviation or as a percentage.
