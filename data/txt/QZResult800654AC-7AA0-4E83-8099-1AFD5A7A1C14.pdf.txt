ABSTRACT
UBC9 is an E2-conjugating enzyme that is required for SUMOylation and has been
implicated in regulating several critical cellular pathways. UBC9 is overexpressed
in certain tumors, such as lung adenocarcinoma, ovarian carcinoma and melanoma,
which implies that it has special clinical significance. However, the role of UBC9 in
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) drug responsiveness is not clear. In this study, we
investigated the clinicopathological significance of UBC9 in HCC and investigated the
mechanism of UBC9-mediated chemosensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX) in hepatocellular
carcinoma cells. We found that relative to adjacent normal tissues, UBC9 was
markedly overexpressed in HCC, which closely correlated with tumor size, tumor
microsatellite formation, and tumor encapsulation. Our results also showed that
down-regulation of UBC9 by shRNA reduced the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl and
increased the expression of cleaved-Caspase3, which is a proapoptotic protein. These
changes were associated with reduced apoptosis in response to DOX. Furthermore,
we observed a mechanism involving modulation of the P38 and ERK1/2 signaling
pathways. Together, our results indicate that down-regulation of UBC9 sensitizes
cells to anticancer drugs, is possibly associated with the regulation of ERK1/2 and
P38 activation and interacts with the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Thus, knockdown
of UBC9 may have a tumor suppressor effect and UBC9 could be a potential target for
the treatment of HCC cancer.

INTRODUCTION

approach has led to breakthroughs in effective treatments
for malignant tumors.”However, sorafenib, the sole
medicine that targets HCC, can only increase the average
survival rate of patients by approximately 3 months [4–6],
and sorafenib has side effects, such as diarrhea, handfoot skin disease, and high blood pressure [7, 8].The
poor efficacy and severe side effects seriously limit the
use of sorafenib in clinical practice [9]. Therefore, new
molecular target drugs with better efficacy and lower side
effects should be studied further to develop additional
treatments for HCC.
SUMO is a highly conserved protein family that
is involved in protein modification after translation.
Although SUMOylation is similar to ubiquitination in

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth mostcommon cancer and the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths worldwide [1]. However, in China in 2015,
it was estimated that 111.5 thousand people died from
HCC, which was the third leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in China [2]. Due to its hidden onset, clinical
diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is more complex
and there are few effective treatments. The effective
treatments for HCC include surgery, intervention therapy
and molecular target therapy, among a few other options
[3]. Molecular target therapy is currently the primary focus
of drug and treatment development for HCC [4], and this

structure, conjugation process and attachment to target
proteins, their biological consequences are different.
Unlike ubiquitination, which normally targets protein
degradation, SUMOylation has been implicated in the
regulation of protein stability, protein–protein interactions,
transcriptional activity and subcellular localization
[10–11]. SUMOylation is a multi-step process that is
catalyzed by multiple enzymes, including the E1, E2 and
E3 enzymes [10–11]. In contrast to the ubiquitination
pathway, which utilizes several E2 conjugating enzymes
[12], UBC9 is the only known E2 conjugating enzyme
in the SUMO pathway and has been found in yeast,
invertebrates and vertebrates [13–15].SUMOylation
regulates a diverse array of cellular functions, including
DNA replication and repair, chromosome integrity and
segregation, kinetochore assembly, nuclear transport,
signal transduction and cell cycle progression [16–21].
Many proto-oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins
are targets of SUMOylation, including Bcl2, PLAG1/
PLAGL2, c-Fos, c-Myb and c-Jun, which plays a key
role in regulating cancer cell proliferation and survival
[20]. Some oncogenic signaling pathways were found
to be regulated by SUMOylation, including MAPK,
NF-κB, nuclear receptor transcription factors and their
coregulators [22–24].
As the sole E2 enzyme, UBC9 is believed to play a
central role in the biological processes of cell development
through SUMOylation. UBC9 plays a crucial role in cell
cycle regulation, apoptosis, DNA repair, gene transcription
and nucleocytoplasmic transport [25, 26]. Other more
recent studies have shown that UBC9 can function
without depending on SUMOylation to regulate cell
growth [27, 28]. These studies suggested that regulating
the expression of UBC9 would lead to changes in cell
growth and function. In support of this notion, it was
reported that UBC9 might regulate bcl-2 expression
through the ER signaling pathway, which ultimately
contributes to alterations in drug responsiveness and
tumor growth [30]. It also has previously been shown that
overexpression of UBC9-DN is associated with increased
drug sensitivity in breast cancer [32]. In yeast, a defect in
the ubc9 gene caused increased sensitivity to genotoxic
drugs [33]. Therefore, the influence of the expression or
function of UBC9 can impact drug responsiveness and
tumorigenesis and alterations in protein SUMOylation
and de-SUMOylation caused by UBC9 could affect cancer
development and drug resistance.
Given the importance of UBC9 in tumor
development and growth, we first demonstratedin this
study that UBC9 was upregulated in HCC tissues compared
to non-tumor tissues and showed that overexpression
of UBC9 was associated with tumor aggressiveness
and the grade of malignancy. We also studied whether
down-regulated expression of UBC9 could increase the
sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapy drugs. As shown
in prior studies, doxorubicin (DOX) is widely used in HCC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemotherapy and mainly functions by preventing DNA
replication and RNA synthesis, which ultimately inhibits
tumor cell division and proliferation [34]. In this study,
we aimed to determine if inhibition of UBC9 expression
could increase the sensitivity of HCC cells to DOX and
to examine the molecular mechanisms that were involved.

RESULTS
To explore the expression and significance of
UBC9 in hepatic cancer (HCC) tissues
The expression levels of UBC9 were determined for
103 patients with hepatic cancer by immunohistochemistry
and Western blot. The results of immunohistochemistry
and Western blot showed that the expression of UBC9
was significantly higher compared to that of the adjacent
pericancerous liver tissues. The IHC results showed
that the UBC9 protein was highly expressed in 69.92%
(72/103) of the HCC tissue samples and in only 17.47 %
(18/103) of the adjacent tissues (Figure 1C). Additionally,
the western blotting results showed that the UBC9
protein levels were significantly elevated in HCC tissues
(Figure 1A and 1B), which was consistent with the IHC
results. These findings strongly indicate that UBC9 was
overexpressed in HCC. The difference was statistically
significant (P < 0.001). Next, we analyzed the association
between UBC9 expression and the clinical pathological
parameters in 103 HCC patients. The results showed
that UBC9 overexpression correlated closely with
tumor size, tumor microsatellite formation, and tumor
encapsulation (P < 0.05 for all; Table 1). These results
indicated that UBC9 overexpression was involved in HCC
aggressiveness and the grade of malignancy. Additional
experiments were needed to determine whether the status
of UBC9 overexpression might be an independent factor.

Analysis of UBC9 expression with UBC9 shRNA
in HCC cells
We first examined the levels of UBC9 in a variety
of HCC cells by Western blotting. The results indicated
that the expression of UBC9 in HCC cells was higher than
that in normal liver cells (Figure 2A). Then, we stably
transfected a UBC9-specific short hairpin RNA (shUBC9)
into in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells , which exhibit
relatively high expression of UBC9 among HCC cell
lines (Figure 2A) .Western blotting and qRT-PCR showed
that the UBC9 levels significantly declined in HepG2
cells (Figure 2B–2D). The amounts of UBC9 mRNA
and protein were significantly reduced in HepG2 cells
transfected with one UBC9 shRNA (shUBC9-a), which
showed that efficient knockdown of UBC9 occurred.
Similar results were observed in cells transfected with
another UBC9 shRNA (shUBC9-b), although the effect
of UBC9 downregulation was smaller. However, the

UBC9 expression levels were only slightly affected by the
transfection of UBC9 shRNA (shUBC9-c). The amounts
of UBC9 protein were significantly reduced in SMMC7721 cells transfected with one UBC9 shRNA (shUBC9-a)
(Figure 2E and 2F), These results suggested that UBC9
shRNA could substantially reduce UBC9 expressions in
HCC cells though transfection of UBC9-a shRNA.

were treated with different concentrations of DOX (0,0
−1.6 μg for 24 h. The cell viability in the presence of
DOX was further evaluated with CCK8 assay. It was
indicated down-regulation of UBC9 resulted in poor cell
viability (Figure 3B). The IC50 values of HCC cells to
DOX were calculated from the cell viability plots. For
hepG2 cells, IC50 values of shUBC9-a group cells were
decreased compared to NC group (p < 0.05); but there was
no significant difference between the Normal and shNC
group cells (Figure 3A), For SMMC-7721, As displayed
by Figure 3C, suppression of UBC9 was also accompanied
by significantly decreased IC50 values. These data all
indicated that down-regulation of UBC9 could increase
sensitivity of HCC cells to DOX.
To study the inhibition rate of DOX in HCC cells,
we used the three groups of HepG2 and SMMC7721

the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl and increased the

The influence of apoptosis after UBC9 shRNA in
combination with DOX treatment in HCC cells

48 h. The cell cycle assay revealed that the shUBC9-a
group had a higher number of cells in the G2/M phase
compared to the Normal and shNC groups (p < 0.01)
(Figure 6A–6C). Moreover, the cells shUBC9-a combined
with DOX treatment caused more accumulation of
cells in the G2/M phase compared to the other groups
(P ﹤ 0.001). The increase in the G2/M phase cell
population was accompanied by a reduction in the number
of cells in the G0/G1 and S phases of the cell cycle.
Therefore, UBC9 shRNA combined with DOX induced
cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase.

We investigated whether the effects of shUBC9-a
with DOX treatment increased apoptosis using the
Annexin V-FITC/PI staining method. We used three
groups of cells alone or treated with doxorubicin for
24 h. UBC9 knockdown or DOX treatment led to a
marked increase in cell apoptosis; however, combination
of UBC9 knockdown with DOX induced a higher cell
apoptosis than chemotherapy group alone in HepG2 and
SMMC7721 (Figure 5A–5C). These findings suggested
that down-regulation of UBC9 expression increased the
chemosensitivity of doxorubicin-treated HCC cells by
inducing apoptosis.

Cell apoptosis is tightly controlled by a complex
regulatory network. The MAPK pathway is required for
apoptosis and can be induced by chemotherapeutic agents,
and when UBC9 shRNA was combined with DOX, the
MAPK pathways may play a key role in the induction
of apoptosis. The expression of the p-p38 and p-ERK1/2
proteins obviously decreased in the shUBC9-a with DOX
and shUBC9-a groups (P ﹤ 0.001 all) in HepG2 and

To examine whether UBC9 shRNA combined with
DOX was related to the cell cycle, we examined cell
cycle progression using flow cytometry. We used three

SMMC-7721 cells, and the shUBC9-a with DOX group
had a larger reduction compared to shUBC9-a alone
(P < 0.001) (Figure 7A, 7B).

In the present study, we investigated the effects
of the down-regulation of UBC9 on chemosensitivity to
doxorubicin in HCC cells and explored the underlying
mechanisms. First, our data indicated that UBC9
was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. UBC9
overexpression correlated closely with tumor size, tumor
microsatellite formation, and tumor encapsulation.
Second, down-regulation of UBC9 increased DOXinduced apoptosis and caused cell-cycle arrest in HCC
cells.Third, inhibition of UBC9 significantly lowered the
IC50 values of DOX for HCC cells, which indicated that
down-regulation of UBC9 increased the sensitivity of
HCC cells to DOX. Fourth, down-regulation of UBC9
resulted in a decrease in the expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl as well as upregulation
of the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins cleavedCaspase3 in HCC cells,which are important regulators
of apoptosis and drug resistance [45]. Finally, the results
indicate that knockdown of UBC9 may have an effect on
the MAPK signaling pathway, which has an important role
in both cell apoptosis and tumor cell drug resistance [46].
The extrinsic death receptor and intrinsic
mitochondrial pathway can both induce death in cancer

DISCUSSION
Protein SUMOylation has been implicated in the
regulation of protein stability, subcellular localization,
and activity of transcription factors [35–37]. There is also
evidence that suggests that SUMOylation alterations are
associated with multidrug resistance in hepatocellular
carcinoma [38]. UBC9 is the sole E2-conjugating enzyme
required for SUMOylation. Therefore, inhibiting the
expression of UBC9 could damage cell SUMOylation.
There is increasing evidence that UBC9 plays an important
role in human neoplasia [39–41] and in chemotherapy
resistance,which has been demonstrated both in nonsmall-cell lung cancer and melanomas [42–43]. Recently,
another study has indicated that high UBC9 expression
correlates with a poor response to chemotherapy and
poor clinical prognosis in breast cancer [44]. Given these
findings, we know that UBC9 may have a global function
in tumorigenesis and drug responsiveness.

cells and sensitize them to established cytotoxic agents
and radiation therapy [47]. In the present study, downregulation of UBC9 significantly suppressed expression
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl in addition to promoting expression
of cleaved-Caspase3 combined with DOX. These data
suggest that UBC9 modulates DOX-induced apoptosis via
the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Recently, drug resistance
has been attributed to abrogation of the intrinsic apoptosis
pathway [47]. Bcl-2, one of the most important regulators
of this pathway is part of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, and
upregulation of Bcl-2 expression increases resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs, whereas downregulation of Bcl-2
expression promotes an apoptotic response to anticancer
drugs [45]. Additionally,chemotherapy drugs, such as
doxorubicin, can lead to unnecessary cell death, whereas
Bcl-xl showed a stronger protective effect than Bcl-2
against cell death induced by several chemotherapy agents
[48]. In particular, Caspase3 is one of the key components
of apoptosis and is responsible for the Bcl-2and Bclxl proteins [49]. Thus, the findings suggest that downregulation of UBC9 significantly increased the sensitivity
to DOX and that sensitivity might be partly activated by
the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in HCC cells.
It was reported that SUMOylation plays an
important role in MAPK signal pathway conditioning

[50–52]. MAPK is an important component of cell
signaling pathways and regulates many protein functions
in human cells [53]. The MAPK pathways respond to
various extracellular stimuli and control a large number
of fundamental cellular processes, including growth,
proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis
[54]. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) play
an important role in both cell apoptosis and tumor cell
drug resistance [45]. MAPKs include extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun NH2terminal kinase (JNK) [55]. The ERK-MAPK signaling
pathways are closely related to cell drug susceptibility
[56], and there is also a recognized connection between
the MAPK and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Activation
of ERK1/2 inhibits BIM-induced apoptosis by interfering
with the binding of BIM to MCL-1 and BCL-XL [57].
The P38-MAPK signaling pathways are closely related
to stress-induced apoptosis and cell-drug susceptibility
[58]. Our study showed that down-regulation of UBC9
combined with DOX inhibited ERK1/2 and P-p38
activation in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells. The levels of
phosphorylation of ERK and P38 expression decreased in
HCC, which indicated that inhibition of UBC9 increased
the sensitivity of chemotherapeutic drugs through
inhibition of the ERK1/2-MAPK and P38-MAPK cell

pathways. These findings suggested that the increased
sensitivity of HCC cells to doxorubicin induced by
down-regulation of UBC9 was achieved by inhibiting the
MAPK signaling pathway. The results further showed that
inhibition of UBC9 gene expression could increase the
sensitivity of HCC cells to doxorubicin.
In summary, we demonstrated that UBC9 was
overexpressed in HCC and that its expression was
correlated with clinical outcomes. Our results also showed
that down-regulation of UBC9 increased the sensitivity to
DOX in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This phenomenon
occurs due to decreased expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl and
increased expression of cleaved-Caspase3,which resulted
in DOX-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of the
ERK1/2 and P38 MAPK pathways by down-regulation
of UBC9 could increase the response to DOX in HCC
cells. These results suggest that UBC9 may be a potential
candidate for a chemosensitizer in the treatment of HCC
and imply that UBC9 down-regulation might serve as a
therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.

cells, shUBC9-a and shNC stable cells were digested
and counted, and 1 × 104 cells in 100 μl medium were
seeded in 96-well plates. After a 24 h incubation, the
cultured cells were adherent. Different concentrations of
DOX (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.6 μg/ml) were added
to the medium. After incubating the cells at 37°C (5%
CO2) for 24 h, 10 μl of CCK-8 cells (Bytotime, Jiangsu,
China) were added to the medium. After the cells were
incubated for another 2 h at 37°C (5% CO2), we measured
the opticaldensity (OD) at 450 nm on a microplate reader
(Bio-Rad, California, USA). The relative inhibition rate =
(OD of control group − OD of drug group)/OD of control
group × 100%. We used SPSS 18.0 to calculate the half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50).

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen),
and cDNA synthesis was performed using the Prime-Script
RT reagent Kit (Takara, Japan). Quantitative-PCR was
performed using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq ™II (Takara) on
an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (ABI,
USA). The UBC9 primer sequence came from PrimerBank
(http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/).
Oligomer
primers were designed for the following genes: UBC9
(Sense: 5-CAG GAA AGA AAG GGA CTC-3; Antisense:
5-TTC GGG TGA AAT AAT GG-3) and GAPDH: (Sense:
5-GCA TCC TGC ACC ACC AAC T-3; Antisense: 5-GCA
GTG ATG GCA TGG ACT GT-3). Each reaction had a total
volume of 20 μl, including 12.5 μl of SYBR Green master
mix, 200 nmol of each forward and reverse primer, 1 μl of
cDNA, and 7 μl of ddH2O. The cycling conditions included
an initial denaturation step of 10 minutes at 94°C, followed
by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C, one minute at 55°C and
one minute at 60°C.

Apoptosis assay by AnnexinV-FITC/PI staining
Cells (5 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates. After
the cells were transfected, 0.3 μg/ml DOX was added to
the medium, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. We
harvested the adherent cells, washed the cells twice with
cold PBS and then resuspended the cells in 1 × Binding
Buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Then
100 μl of the solution was transferred to a 5 ml culture
tube. Next, 5 μl of AnnexinV-PE and 5 μl of PI were
added (BD BioSciences, USA). The cells were gently
vortexed and incubated for 15 min at RT (25°C) in the
dark. Finally, we added 400 μl of 1 × binding buffer to
each tubeaccording to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The stained cells were examined with FACSCalibur flow
cytometry.

Western blot
The six experimental groups were removed from
the incubator. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS
twice andharvested. Then, cell lysates were prepared
using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors
(100 mM Tris, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA,
1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate acid, 0.1% SDS,
2 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM leupeptin, 2 mM
pepstatin). The protein concentrations were determined
using the BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockford, USA). Then, 10 μl of each sample was

Cell-cycle phase distribution assay
Cells (5 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates after
transfection, and then,0.3 μg/ml DOX was added to the
medium. After incubation for 48 h, the adherent cells
were collected and washed twice with cold PBS. Then,
the cells were fixed in ice cold 70% ethanol. The cell cycle
distribution was analyzed using the Cell Cycle Analysis

The level of UBC9 in paraffin-embedded tissue
sections was detected with immunohistochemical staining.
A goat monoclonal antibody was used as the primary
antibody. Paraffin-embedded tissues were pretreated at
65°C for 2 h, followed by deparaffinization using standard
procedures. Antigen retrieval was carried out with an
antigen retrieval solution (10 mmol/L Tris, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, Ph 9.0) before 2% sheep serum was added. Then,
the slides were incubated with the antibody for UBC9
(ab21193, Abcam) (1:200 dilution)at 4 °C overnight. Next,
the slides were labeled with EnVision HRP kits (DAKO)
at room temperature for 30 minutes, incubated with DAB
substrate liquid (DAKO), and counterstained with Mayer›s
hematoxylin(DAKO). All of the sections were observed
and photographed with a light microscope using a DP70
CCD system (Olympus Corp.).

Statistics
All data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0. The results
are presented as the means ± SD from three independent
experiments. The differences between the groups were
analyzed by the Student t test when two groups were
compared or by one-way ANOVA when more than two
groups were compared. The correlations between the
UBC9 expression levels and clinical pathological variables
were analyzed using Pearson’s Chi-squared test. The test
results were considered significant at P < 0.05.
