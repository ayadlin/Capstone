ABSTRACT
In order to decrease the toxicity of paclitaxel (PTX) and increase the efficiency,
we developed an amphiphilic PTX injection system using a biodegradable and
biocompatible polymer synthesized by folic acid, cholesterol, and chitosan (FACC).
This FACC-based polymer had a low critical concentration (64.13μg/ml) and could selfassemble in aqueous condition to form nanoscale micelles. The particle sizes of FACCPTX micelles were 253.2±0.56 nm, the encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity
of these FACC-PTX micelles were 65.1±0.23% and 9.1±0.16%, respectively. The
cumulative release rate was about 85% at pH 5.0 which was higher than that at pH 7.4
(76%). This pH-dependent release behavior was highly suggesting that PTX release
from FACC-PTX micelles might be higher in a weak acidic tumor microenvironment
and lower toxic for normal cells. The anti-cancer effectiveness of FACC-PTX micelles
was investigated by in vitro cytotoxicity and targeting study. The results revealed that
FACC micelles have non-toxic on cells as evidenced by high cell viability found (86%
to 100%) in the cells cultured with various concentrations of FACC micelles (1 to 500
μg/ml). Targeting study indicated that the cytotoxic efficacy of FACC-PTX micelles was
significantly higher than that with Taxol® in the Hela cells (folate receptor-positive
cells). These findings indicated that the anticancer efficiency of PTX can be enhanced
by adding some cancer cell positive receptor into drug carrier and the FACC micelle
was a potential tumor targeting carrier for PXT delivery.

cancer cells as compared to PTX [3]. However, particle
flocculation or aggregation was difficult to overcome [4].
Peptide-conjugated biodegradable PTX nanoparticles
exhibited significantly stronger antiangiogenic activity than
Taxol® on endothelial cells [5]. However, the problems
with peptide stability and their short blood half-lives due
to peptidase sensitivity would limit the effectiveness of
peptide-conjugated drugs. Chitosan-PLGA particles were
significantly enhanced PTX cytotoxicity for 4T1 cells [6].
Because carboxylic acid chain ends are the products of the
hydrolytic cleavage of PLGA polymers, the degradation
of the PLGA polymer may lead to high acidic and painful
products locally [7]. Therefore, a less toxic and bettertolerated delivery system for PTX to substitute Taxol® is
still a big challenge for both clinical medical doctors and
anti-cancer researchers.
Among these new delivery systems, polymeric
micelles are recognized as one of the most potential

INTRODUCTION
Paclitaxel (PTX) is an effective and wide spectrum
chemotherapeutic agent, which has been successfully used
in the clinical treatment of many solid tumors, especially
breast and ovarian tumor [1]. However, the poor solubility
and high toxicity of PTX limits the medical applications
of this drug. In order to realize the targeted delivery of
PTX to tumor, many methods have been studied. One of
successful medications was a commercial drug named
Taxol® formulated with Cremophor EL® (polyethoxylated
castor oil) and dehydrated ethanol (50:50 v/v). However,
cremophor EL® can induce severe side effects as
hypersensitivity, neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity [2].
The other studies have largely improved the solubility and
side effects of PTX but still remained many limitations.

chemotherapeutic agent delivery systems, due to their
good solubilization efficiency and reducing non-selective
reticuloendothelial system (RES) scavenge. Moreover,
the nanoscale dimension polymeric micelles exhibit
tumor accumulation by enhancing permeability and
retention (EPR) effect [8]. Chitosan is widely distributed
in nature and used in micelle system owing to its good
physicochemical characters, including biodegradability,
biocompatibility, low toxicity, pH sensitiveness and ease of
chemical modification [9]. However, chitosan suffers from
a poor solubility in water, which is a major drawback for
drug formulations [10]. In order to improve the properties
of chitosan, chemical modification of the chitosan chains
has been investigated. Amphiphilic copolymers present
a double affinity for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
environments and are able to self-organize in water to
form, in most cases, specific architectures such as micelles
or vesicles [11].
In recent years, several chitosan PTX micelle were
studied, such as N-succinyl-palmitoyl-chitosan PTX
micelles [12], N-octyl-N-(2-carboxylbenzoyl) chitosan
PTX micelles [13], amphiphilic carboxymethyl chitosanquercetin PTX micelles [14] and α-tocopherol succinatemodified chitosan PTX micelles [15]. However, their
applications are greatly limited due to high toxicity on
normal cells. In order to enhance the tumor targeting of
micelles system and decrease the injury to normal tissues,
a new modified PTX delivery system is needed. Folic acid
(FA) and its derivatives are essential nutrients in humans
and play an important role in nucleotide synthesis and
methylation reactions. Our hypothesis is that PTX can be
delivered effectively by a chitosan modified with folic acid
system, which is higher expression in human cancer cells
such as Hela and KB cells than in normal cells [16, 17].
The aim of this study is to test our hypothesis by
developing a novel amphiphilic folic acid-cholesterolchitosan-conjugated PTX micelle system to target folate
receptor positive cancer cells. Folic acid-cholesterolchitosan (FACC) is synthesized by aminoacylation
reaction of chitosan primary amino groups and FACC-PTX
micelles are prepared by dialysis method. Subsequently,
the physical properties and biological activity of FACCPTX micelles are characterized. In addition, cancer
targeting specificity of FACC-PTX micelles is determine
using Hela (folate receptor-positive) and A549 (folate
receptor-negative) cells [16].

indicated that a FACC polymer has been synthesized by
three-step reactions. At the first step, the hydroxyl group
of cholesterol was activated by succinic anhydride to
form cholesterol succinate. At the second step, cholesterol
succinate reacted with chitosan to create a cholesterolchitosan (CH-CS) polymer. At the third step, FA reacted
with CH-CS polymer to form a FACC polymer. As shown
in Figure 2A, the basic characteristics of FT-IR bands
of chitosan at 3468 cm-1 was assigned to the stretching
vibration of O-H and N-H. This peak was still expressed
in the FT-IR spectrum of CH-CS polymer (Figure 2B).
However, new peak appeared at approximately 1652-1940
cm-1 which were attributed to the formation of –NHCO–
group in CH-CS (Figure 2B) and FACC (Figure 2C)
polymers. The appearance of the peak at 1709 cm-1 in the
spectrum was attributed to benzene ring of the FA, which
stand for amide linkage was identified in FA modified CHCS (Figure 2C).
1
H NMR was investigated to further confirm
the chemical structure of the CH-CS and FACC. The
characteristic peaks of chitosan (Figure 3A) appeared
at 1.0-3.0 ppm. Compared with chitosan and CH-CS,
new peaks in CH-CS spectrum (Figure 3B) appeared in
the range of 3.5-5.5 ppm due to the hydrogen protons
of cholesterol moiety, which suggested that cholesterol
modified groups were successfully grafted onto the
chitosan backbone.
Compared the 1H NMR spectrum of FACC (Figure
3C) and CH-CS (Figure 3B), the 1H NMR δ spectrum of
FACC exhibited the new peaks at 2.5 (br s, β and γ-CH2groups, 4H), 5.95 ppm (s, aromatic H of pteridine) and
6.65 ppm (benzene ring) as shown in Figure 3. The
appearance of these peaks confirmed the successful
conjugation of folate with CH-CS.

Critical micelle concentration (CMC)
The CMC of the FACC was determined by pyrene
fluorescence probe technique. At low concentration
(C) of FACC (C<CMC), there were negligible changes
in fluorescence intensity ratio of I384/I372. As the
concentration increased, remarkable increase of the
intensity ratio was observed by fluorescence spectroscopy.
The CMC curves of FACC determined from emission
spectra of pyrene in FACC solutions were shown in
Figure 4. Based on the intensity ratio data, the CMC value
of FACC was calculated by the crossover point. The CMC
value of FACC was 64.13 μg/ml, which demonstrated
that FACC could form very stable micelles at low
concentration.

(EE), loading efficiency (LE), mean diameter size and
polydispersities (PDI) of PTX-FACC micelles were
shown in Table 1 with the different dialysis times. The
result demonstrated that EE, LE and the micelles size
of the micelles were decreased with the dialysis time
extension. The PTX-FACC micelles (dialysis time 8 hrs)
were both have high EE and LE, but with low particle
size, were selected for future research. The morphology of
PTX-FACC micelles were determined by TEM (Figure 5).
FACC micelles and PTX-FACC micelles had uniform
spherical morphology, and the distribution of particle size
was in the range of 100-250 nm. These results were in
agreement with the measurement of Zetasizer Nano ZS90
instrument (Figure 6).

The concentration of PTX released from PTXFACC micelles was determined in vitro at 37°C in PBS
solution with 3 different pH (5.0, 7.4, 9.0) conditions.
The PTX released from commercial drug, Taxol was
also tested at the same conditions (pH 7.4) and used
as a control (PTX group). Our results showed that the
releasing process of PTX was faster at acidic condition
(pH=5.0) than both physiological condition (pH=7.4)
and basic condition (pH=9.0) from FACC-PTX micelles
(Figure 7). PTX released from commercial drug, Taxol
(PTX group) was much faster than that from FACC-PTX
micelles. More than 95% of PTX released from Taxol®

at pH 7.4 in 24 hours (Figure 7). However, FACC-PTX
micelles released the same levels of PTX at the end of 96
hours. As presented in Figure 7, about 92% of PTX was
released within 96 hours at pH 5.0, while about 86% of
PTX was released at pH 7.4. This pH-dependent release
behavior was highly suggesting that PTX release from
FACC-PTX micelles might be higher in a weak acidic

tumor microenvironment [18] and lower toxic for normal
cells.

evaluated using MTT assay on Hela and A549 cells and

directly compared their efficacies to that of Taxol®. FACC
micelles did not have any obvious effect on the Hela and
A549 cells throughout the whole range of concentrations
examined (Figure 8). The MTT analyses demonstrated
that FACC-PTX micelles were more cytotoxicity than
Taxol® (Figure 9). In Hela cells (folate receptor-positive),
the cytotoxic efficacy of FACC-PTX micelles was
significantly higher than that with Taxol®. However,
there was no significantly different cytotoxic efficacy in
A549 (folate receptor-negative) cells between FACC-PTX
micelles and Taxol®. Besides, in the FACC-PTX micelles
groups, the cytotoxicity of Hela cells was significantly
higher than that with A549 cells (Figure 9). These results
were in accordance with those observed in the FACC-PTX
micelles cellular uptake.

the Hela cells have express more folate receptor than A549
cells. This observation suggests that the FACC micelles
facilitated intracellular uptake of FITC in the positive
folate receptor cells.

DISCUSSION
Nowadays, amphiphilic micelles have been
extensively exploited to improve the therapeutic
efficiency and reduce severe side effects of anticancer
drugs. Chitosan has been chosen as the micelles carrier
material because it has many amino groups on the
molecular chain and modified easily [19]. Cholesterolmodified O-carboxymethyl chitosan conjugate is
amphiphilic in nature and has self-aggregation behavior
in aqueous media [20]. Furthermore, chitosan modified
with special materials such as folate [21] and RGD [22]
polypeptides constitutes active receptor enhanced targeted
drug delivery systems. FA is a stable, inexpensive and
poorly immunogenic chemical with a high affinity for
the FA receptor [23]. Therefore, in this study, FACC was
synthesized to enhance the specificity of PTX delivery to
tumor cells/tissues.
To prepare low toxic and higher efficacy FACCPTX micelles, all organic solvents have been removed
by dialysis method. Amphiphilic FACC could form
to micelles by self-assembly, it was easy to carry
hydrophobic anticancer drugs. Folic acid conjugated
glycol chitosan micelles for targeted delivery of
doxorubicin (DFCHGC) were prepared by emulsion/
solvent evaporation method which induced organic solvent
ClCH3. The size of DFCHGC micelles was from 282 to
320 nm, which was larger than FACC-PTX micelles (150250 nm) [24]. Hydrotropic oligomer-conjugated glycol

Intracellular uptake of FITC-FACC micelles
The intracellular uptake efficiency of FITC in Hela
cells and A549 cells was investigated using laser confocal
microscope. To precisely observe the cellular distributions
of FACC micelles, we performed double fluorescence
which with green fluorescence from FITC-FACC micelles
and red fluorescence from TRITC-folate receptor. The
cells were also counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (blue
fluorescence) to form treble fluorescence. As shown in
Figure 10, mouch higher fluorescence intensity of FITC
was found in Hela cells treated with FITC-FACC micelles
than that ofHela cells treated with FITC solution and
A549 cells treated with FITC-FACC micelles. However,
the fluorescence signal neither found in Hela cells nor in
A549 cells when they were treated with FITC solution.
The fluorescence intensity of TRITC in Hela cells was
found to be higher than that in A549 cells, indicating that

at low concentration.

chitosan paclitaxel nanoparticles (PTX-HO-CNPs) were
prepared by dialysis method with the average size 343
nm, which was also larger than FACC-PTX micelles [2].
Although the loading efficiency of PTX-HO-CNPs were
about 96% higher than FACC-PTX micelles (75%), the
smaller size of FACC-PTX micelles would batter for
tumor targeting by EPR effect.
The FACC has amphiphilic character, which
CMC value was 64.13 μg/ml. The higher the degree of
substitution of chitosan, the lower the CMC value. The
CMCs of N-octyl-N-(2-carboxylbenzoyl) chitosan PTX
micelles were from 11 to 72 μg/ml [25]. Cholesterol
and folate in the chitosan may have steric hindrance, the
degree of substitution of FACC is difficult to be higher.

However, our result showed that FACC could form very
stable micelles at low concentration.
The result of FACC-PTX micelles in vitro release
suggested that PTX release rate increased with the
decreasing pH value. This result may be attributed to
the changes in the structure of the amino of the micelles.
In acidic conditions, -NH2 in the surface of micelles
transformed to –NH3+ through binding protons. The
transition between hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups
make micelles unstable under acidic solutions [26]. This
pH-dependent release behavior was highly desirable for
targeted cancer therapy because it could accelerate the
amount of drug released at tumor site and decrease the
drug release in normal tissues based on the different acid

environment between tumor tissues and normal tissues
[27].
Cell viability profile assessed by MTT assay
demonstrated that FACC micelles had no significant
cytotoxicity at concentration as high as 500 μg/ml, so
that FACC micelles may be a safety tool which possibly
overcomes anticancer therapy. We also demonstrated that
FACC-PTX micelles targeted Hela cells, the cytotoxic
efficacy was significant higher than that with A549 cells.
Our results indicate that FACC-PTX micelles were a
promising nanoscale drug formulation for cancer therapy.

FACC was prepared through aminoacylation
reaction (Figure 1). Briefly, 50 mg FA were dissolved in
10 ml anhydrous DMSO with stirring. EDC (3 mM) was
added into the solution and stirred at room temperature
for 1h. Then 25 mg CH-CS was dissolved in 25 ml of
HCl-THF (1% HCl-water : THF = 1/1, v/v) in a new
flask to make a clear solution which was added to the
FA-DMSO-EDC reaction mixture, stirred at 30°C in the
dark overnight. The resultant mixture was dialyzed against
0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and changed PBS
buffer every two hours for 3 days, followed by dialysis
against water and changed water every 6 hours for 3
days using a dialysis bag (cut-off MWCO 7KDa). The
synthesized product of folic acid-cholesterol-chitosan
(FACC) was obtained by lyophilization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Paclitaxel (PTX) was purchased from HaiZheng
Co. Ltd. (Zhejiang, China); Chitosan (MW 50
kDa, degree of deacetylation >90%), cholesterol,
folic
acid
(FA),
1-(3-dimethylaminoproply)-3ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC), phosphate buffered saline
(PBS,
pH7.4),
3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) and dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) were purchased from Sigma (St Louise, MO,
USA). All solvents and reagents used in this study were
analytical grade.

Characterization of FACC conjugates
The structure of chitosan, CH-CS and FACC
was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy (WGH-30, Gang Dong Technology Co.
Ltd., Tianjin, China) and 1H NMR spectrum (in D2O, 500
MHz, Bruker spectrometer, Switzerland). For IR spectrum
analysis, about 5 mg of dried chitosan, or CH-CS or FACC
sample was mixed with 50 mg of KBr and grounded with
pestle and mortar to make thin discs, respectively. The
spectra were scanned at room temperature from 400 to
4000 cm-1 wavelength with a resolution of 2 cm-1. For
1
H NMR analysis, chitosan, CH-CS, and FACC were
dissolved in deuterated reagents and confirmed by 1H
NMR spectrometer.

Cell lines
Human cervices carcinoma cell line (Hela), and
human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) were
purchased from Blood Research Administration (Tianjin,
China). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco Modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 100 U·mL-1 penicillin and 100
μg·mL-1 of streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Critical micelle concentration (CMC)
The CMC of the FACC was determined by using
pyrene (>95%, Sigma, St Louise, MO, USA) as a
hydrophobic probe in fluorescence spectroscopy (Perkin
Elmer, IS55, USA). The pyrene solutions (6.0×10-5 mM)
in methanol were added into the test tubes and evaporated
under a stream of nitrogen gas to remove the methanol.
A serial of FACC solutions with different concentrations
ranging from 2 to 250 μg/ml were prepared and then left
to equilibrate with a constant pyrene concentration of 60
nM for 24h at 37°C. Fluorescence excitation spectra were
measured at the excitation wavelength of 337 nm, and the
emission wavelength was 350 nm – 450 nm for emission
spectra. Both excitation and emission bandwidths were set
at 8 nm. The peak height intensity ratio (I384/I372) of the
third peak I384 to the first peak I372 was plotted against
the logarithm of polymer concentration. The intersection
of the tangent to the curve at the inflection with the
horizontal tangent through the points at low polymer
concentrations was taken as the CMC value.

Synthesis of cholesterol chitosan (CH-CS)
Cholesterol (0.5 g) and succinic anhydride (0.5 g)
were dissolved in 10 ml pyridine. The mixture was stirred
for 3h at 70°C and then the solvents were evaporated with
vacuum distillation. The precipitate in the reaction mixture
was washed three times with ethanol. The white powder of
cholesterol succinate was obtained by recrystallization in
ethanol. Subsequently, cholesterol succinate (100 mg) was
dissolved in 5 ml methanol and activated by addition EDC
(50 mg) under stirring for 1h. Then 500 mg chitosan in
50 ml of 1% hydrochloric acid (pH 4.0) was added to the
above mixture and the reaction was continued for 24h at
25°C. The resultant mixture was dialyzed against distilled
water for 3 days using a dialysis bag (cut-off MWCO 7
kDa). The synthesized product of cholesterol-chitosan
(CH-CS) with the molecular weight bigger than 7 kDa was
obtained by lyophilization.

Preparation of PTX loaded FACC micelles

This PTX-FACC micelle solution was dialyzed using a
membrane dialysis bag (1ml/bag; cut-off MWCO 7 kDa)
in 50 ml PBS at pH 5.0, 7.4 and 9.0 at 37±0.5°C with
continuous stirring for 7 days, respectively. To meet the
sink condition, 0.5 ml of polysorbate 80 was included
in 50 ml of releasing medium as a solubilizer (1%,
v/v). An anticancer drug, Taxol® (1 ml of 1 mgPTX)
was also dialyzed in 50 ml PBS at pH 7.4 and used as
control labeled PTX. At each predetermined time point,
2 ml releasing medium was taken, refilled with the same
amount of the fresh medium. The concentration of the
released PTX was determined by HPLC as described in
the “Determination of encapsulation efficiency” section.

PTX loaded micelles were prepared with FACC by
a dialysis method. Briefly, 10 mg FACC was dissolved
in 5 ml of HCl-THF mixture consisted of 100 mM
hydrochloric acid (HCl) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (1:1,
v/v) to make a FACC solution. Various concentrations of
PTX were dissolved in methanol and added into FACC
solution then sonicated with ultrasonic cleaner in 25°C
water bath for 30 min with the power output of 200W.
The blend solution (5 ml) was dialyzed against 500 ml
de-ionized water and changed water every 2h using a
dialysis bag (cut-off MWCO 7 kDa). Followed that, the
PTX-FACC micelles were obtained by lyophilization and
kept for further analysis.

Cytotoxicity assay

Characterization of PTX-FACC micelles

The cytotoxicity of PTX-FACC micelles on two
type cells was tested by MTT method. Briefly, Hela (folate
receptor-positive) and A549 (folate receptor-negative)
cells were seeded at a density of 1×104/well in 100 μl of
medium in a 96-well culture plate and incubated for 24 hrs
at 37°C. Different concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 100 μg/ml) of
PTX-FACC micelles and Taxol® were added to the cells
and incubated for another 24 hrs at 37°C, respectively.
Discard the culture medium and then wash the plate with
PBS. MTT solution (0.5%, 10 μl) was added to the cells
in each well and incubated for another 4 hrs at 37°C.
Remove the culture medium, wash the plate with PBS
and then added into 200 μl DMSO. The culture plate was
incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Absorbance was detected
on a Microplate Reader (Thermo Multiskan Ascent 354,
USA) at 492 nm. The cell viability was calculated as the
following formula: Viable cells% = (OD of treated group/
OD of control group) × 100%. Different concentrations (1,
5, 10, 50, 100, 500 μg/ml) of FACC micelles were added
to the two cells lines and treated as mentioned above.

The particle sizes and polydispersities of PTXFACC micelles diluted in de-ionized water were
determined using dynamic light scattering system
Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments, UK) in
triplicate.
PTX-FACC micelles (1 mg) were dissolved with 1
ml of de-ionized water to make a testing sample. Onedrop sample was placed on a carbon-coated film 300 mesh
copper grid and allowed to sit for 5 min or until air-dried.
The sample was stained with uranyl acetate (1%, W/V) for
5 min, and any excess uranyl acetate was removed with
filter paper. Morphological characteristics of the micelles
were examined using a high-resolution transmission
electron microscope (TEM; JEM-2000EX, JEOL Co.
Japan).
The encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading
efficiency (LE) of PTX-FACC micelles were determined
by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC,
UV-230 II, Yilite, Dalian, China) assay described as
follows: PTX-FACC micelles (1 mg) were dissolved in 2
ml of methanol and water mixture (80 : 20, v/v), vortexed,
then sonicated for 30 min. The PTX concentrations were
analyzed by HypersilODS-C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm,
5 μm) using methanol : water (80 : 20, v/v) as a mobile
phase, the PTX was detected at the wavelength of 227
nm, the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the column was
kept at 25°C. EE and LE were calculated by the following
equations:
EE% = [weight of encapsulated drug/ weight of total
drug] ×100%
LE% = [weight of encapsulated drug/ weight of total
drug and vector] ×100%

Intracellular uptake of PTX-FACC micelles
In order to test the distribution of FACC micelles
in Hela and A549 cells, FITC-conjugated FACC micelles
were created according to the published protocol [28].
Hela and A549 cells were seeded at a density of 5×105/
well in a 6-well plate and incubated for 24 hrs at 37°C.
Then 20 μl of FITC-FACC micelles were added into each
well and FITC solution only was used as control. After
2 h of incubation, all wells were incubated with rabbit
monoclonal anti-human folate receptor (1:500) antibody
for another 2 hrs at 37°C, followed by incubation with
TRITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody
(1:150) for 20 min. All wells were washed three times with
PBS, and nucleus was stained for 10 min with Hoechst
(50 μg/ml). The staining solution was removed and
washed three times with PBS. The fluorescence in each
sample was monitored by a SP5 laser scanning confocal
microscopy (Germany).

In vitro release of PTX-FACC micelles
The in vitro release behavior of PTX from PTXFACC micelles were determined by dialysis method for
up to 7 days. Each 50 mg PTX-FACC micelles (contains
5 mg PTX) were resuspended in 5 ml de-ionized water.

The novel amphiphilic folate acid-cholesterolchitosan nanoscale micelles were prepared to the targeted
delivery of paclitaxel. The PTX-FACC micelles developed
in this study had suitable diameter, high encapsulation
efficiency and loading capacity, uniform spherical
morphology, and slow release in vitro. In addition, in vitro
cytotoxicity assays confirmed that PTX-FACC micelles
have a higher cytotoxicity than the Taxol®. PTX-FACC
micelles may provide a potential tool to target FR-positive
cancer cells and hence is a promising candidate for
anticancer activity.
