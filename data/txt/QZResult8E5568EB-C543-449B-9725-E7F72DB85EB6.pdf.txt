BACKGROUND: The alkylating agents (ALKYs) streptozotocin, dacarbazine, and temozolomide currently are the main drugs used in
systemic chemotherapy for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). The promising activity shown by gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in
previous studies prompted this study 1) to confirm the use of GEMOX in a larger population of NET patients, 2) to compare its efficacy with that of ALKYs, and 3) to explore whether the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status could help in
selecting the chemotherapy regimen. METHODS: One hundred four patients with metastatic NETs (37 pancreatic NETs, 33 gastrointestinal NETs, 23 bronchial NETs, and 11 NETs of other/unknown origin) were treated with GEMOX between 2004 and 2014. Among
these patients, 63 also received ALKYs. MGMT promoter gene methylation was assessed via pyrosequencing in 42 patients. RESULTS:
Patients received a median of 6 courses of GEMOX. Twenty-four (23%) had an objective response (OR). The median progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival were 7.8 and 31.6 months, respectively. In the 63 patients treated with both ALKYs and GEMOX, the
ORs (22% and 22%) and the PFSs (7.5 and 7.3 months) were similar. The response was concordant in 53% of the patients. Promoter
gene methylation of MGMT was associated with better outcomes with ALKYs (P 5.03 for OR and P 5.04 for PFS) but not GEMOX.
CONCLUSIONS: GEMOX is effective against NETs; its activity is comparable to that of ALKYs, and it is not influenced by the MGMT
status. Our data suggest that GEMOX might be preferred for patients with unmethylated MGMT tumors. Cancer 2015;121:3428-34.

INTRODUCTION
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare, but their incidence is rising.1 Most of them occur in the gastrointestinal tract
(68%) and the bronchopulmonary system (25%); unfortunately, more than 60% are diagnosed at advanced, unresectable
stages.1 Alkylating agents (ALKYs) such as streptozotocin, dacarbazine, and temozolomide are the basis of most systemic
treatments, at least for advanced pancreatic NETs, with response rates of 30% to 40% and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 4 to 18 months.2-6 As reported for glioblastomas,7-10 the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) status has been suggested to be a predictive factor of responses to ALKYs in NETs, as assessed either by immunohistochemistry11,12 or by an analysis of promoter gene methylation,12,13 even if the results remain conflicting, likely
because of the retrospective nature of the published studies.14
ALKYs are commonly recommended upfront for NETs,4,15,16 but oxaliplatin combined with either 5-fluorouracil17-20 or gemcitabine21 has shown interesting activity with response rates between 17% and 30%. The interaction
between the MGMT status and the response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy has never been explored. Therefore, the
aims of this study were 1) to confirm the activity of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in NETs in a larger study, 2)
to compare the efficacy with that of ALKYs, and 3) to explore whether the MGMT status could help one to choose
between the 2 types of chemotherapy.

GEMOX or Alkylating Agents for NETs?/Dussol et al

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Collected Data

We retrospectively included all patients starting at least 1
cycle of GEMOX for an advanced, well-differentiated NET
at our institution between 2004 and 2014. They may also
have received previous lines of systemic treatments, such as
somatostatin analogues, interferon, everolimus/sunitinib,
and/or other cytotoxic chemotherapies with an ALKY
(streptozotocin, temozolomide, or dacarbazine). Patient
records were retrieved from an institutional database, and
the corresponding files were reviewed. The study protocol
was approved by our institutional review committee.
The following data were collected: number of previous
lines, disease progression before treatment, type of regimen,
start and end dates of chemotherapy, number of cycles, cause
of discontinuation, and efficiency. The efficiency included
the best response assessed with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (objective response [OR]; stable disease
[SD], which was defined as SD for at least 2 months of treatment; and progressive disease [PD]), progression free survival
(PFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients were assessed at 2to 3-month treatment intervals according to their physician’s
choice. When patients received more than 1 type of ALKYbased chemotherapy, we selected for analysis the first one
administered. We tested whether the following factors might
predict a better outcome with either type of chemotherapy:
age, sex, date of diagnosis, multiple endocrine neoplasia 1
syndrome, primary tumor location, number and localization
of metastatic sites, functional tumor status, grade,22 stage and
number of metastatic sites, and MGMT status.
Evaluation of the MGMT Status

Only tumors with tissue available at our institution were
evaluated. Two techniques were used: promoter gene methylation analysis and immunohistochemistry. MGMT promoter methylation was studied by pyrosequencing, as
previously described.12 Pyrosequencing was performed
with the PyroMark Q96 MGMT kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) on a PSQTM96 MA system (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). The results are presented as methylated or
not methylated. MGMT protein expression was evaluated
by an immunohistochemical technique with a mouse
monoclonal anti-MGMT antibody (clone MT23.2; Invitrogen, Camarillo, Calif), as previously described.12
Tumors were scored as negative if less than 10% of the tumor cells in the whole tumor tissue section were positive.
Chemotherapy Regimens

Various chemotherapy regimens were studied, and they
were divided into 2 categories:
Cancer

October 1, 2015

1. The GEMOX regimen consisted of gemcitabine at
1000 mg/m2 followed by oxaliplatin at 100 mg/m2 every 2 weeks.21 GEMOX was stopped at the end of 8
cycles in case of disease control to prevent severe neurotoxicity; a dose reduction was performed according to
guidelines.
2. Three types of ALKY regimens were regularly used at
our institution at doses already reported12: 1)
streptozotocin-based (all regimens combining streptozotocin with either doxorubicin or 5-fluorouracil), 2)
temozolomide-based (all regimens using temozolomide alone or in association with capecitabine),12,16
and 3) dacarbazine-based (all regimens using dacarbazine in association with 5-fluorouracil and/or
epirubicin).15
Statistical Analysis

Categorical variables were expressed as percentages, and
they were compared with the chi-square test or Fisher’s
exact test as appropriate. Continuous variables were
expressed as medians and range. OS was calculated from
the initiation of each chemotherapy line to the date of
death or last follow-up. PFS was calculated from the initiation of the chemotherapy line to the date of disease progression (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors) or death from any cause, whichever
occurred first. PFS and OS were assessed with KaplanMeier analysis, and comparisons were performed with a
log-rank test. A P value < .05 was considered statistically
significant. Cox proportional hazards models were developed with relevant clinicopathologic variables to determine the association of each parameter with OS or PFS.
For continuous variables, the chosen cutoff level was the
median value. Only variables with P values < .10 in the
univariate analysis were introduced into the Cox model.
Relative risks were expressed as hazard ratios with 95%
confidence intervals. The cutoff date for the final analysis
was January 1, 2015. All statistical analyses were performed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences 17.0
(SPSS, Chicago, Ill).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

One hundred four patients with NETs treated with
GEMOX were included in this retrospective analysis. The
clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The
median age was 60 years. The main primary locations
were the pancreas (36%), gastrointestinal tract (32%),
and lungs (22%). All patients had morphologically

well-differentiated NETs; 12% of the cases were grade 1,
69% were grade 2, and 19% were grade 3 according to the
grading system originally described for gastroenteropancreatic NETs. All patients were metastatic at the time
of chemotherapy; the liver was the most frequent location
(89%) and was followed by bone. Sixty-three patients
were also treated with ALKYs; their characteristics were
not significantly different from those of the whole population (Table 1).
GEMOX Activity

More than half the patients received GEMOX as the third
or successive line of chemotherapy. GEMOX was given
for PD to 82% of the patients; the others were treated
upfront (Table 2). The median number of courses of
GEMOX received by patients was 6. Twenty-four
patients (23%) had an OR, 62 (60%) had SD, and 18
(17%) had PD as their best response. The median PFS
and OS were 7.8 months (6.4-9.2 months; Fig. 1A) and
31.6 months (28.6-34.6 months; Fig. 1B), respectively.
The efficacy of GEMOX according to the primary
location of NETs is reported in Table 3. We found no significant predictive factors associated with GEMOX
treatment, including the MGMT status and all charac3430

teristics presented in Table 1, except for the primary site:
lung carcinoids were associated with longer PFS than
tumors of other primary locations (odds ratio, 8.2;
P 5 .04).
Comparison of GEMOX and ALKYs in NETs

Among the 63 patients treated with ALKYs, usually before
GEMOX administration (Table 2), there were 14 (22%)
with an OR, 32 (51%) with SD, and 17 (27%) with PD.
The PFS and the OS were 7.5 months (5.3-9.6 months)
and 62.8 months (55.2-70.4 months), respectively. In
comparison, when these patients were treated with
GEMOX, there were 14 (22%) with an OR, 37 (59%)
with SD, and 12 (19%) with PD; the PFS and the OS
were 7.3 months (5.3-9.3 months) and 29.6 months
(24.4-35.0 months), respectively, and were similar to
those for the whole population treated with GEMOX.
The concordance of responses between GEMOX and
ALKYs in the 63 patients who received the 2 regimens is
presented in Table 4. Thirty-three patients (52%) had the
same response with the 2 regimens (OR/OR, SD/SD, or
PD/PD). However, 3 patients with an OR during ALKY
treatment had PD as their best response with GEMOX.

MGMT Status Is a Predictive Factor of
Responses to ALKYs but Not to GEMOX

The MGMT status, assessed by pyrosequencing, was
available for 42 patients receiving GEMOX, including 26
patients who also received ALKYs. The MGMT gene promoter was methylated in 11 of 42 patients (26%), including 7 of 13 with primary pancreatic NETs, 2 of 16 with
gastrointestinal NETs, 1 of 8 with lung NETs, and 1 of 5
with other primary sites (paragangliomas).23 The MGMT
methylation status had no influence on the response to
GEMOX (Table 5 and Fig. 2A). In contrast, there was a
better outcome for patients with methylated tumors
treated with ALKYs (OR, 40% vs 6% for patients with
Cancer

unmethylated tumors; P 5 .03). All patients with methylated NETs had disease control (OR and SD) as the best
response. The median PFS was 23.8 months for patients
with methylated tumors and 6.7 months for patients with
nonmethylated tumors (Table 5 and Fig. 2B).
The MGMT status, assessed by immunochemistry,
was available for 25 patients receiving GEMOX, including 19 patients who also received ALKYs. MGMT expression was negative in 10 of 25 patients (40%). MGMT
protein loss of expression tended to be associated with a
better response to ALKYs (as measured by the OR rate
and PFS) but not to GEMOX (Table 5).
GEMOX or ALKYs for Pancreatic NETs

We then focused on results for pancreatic NETs because
the pancreas is the only primary site for which the benefit
of cytotoxic chemotherapy is well established (Table 6).
In 37 patients treated with GEMOX, the OR, PFS, and
OS were 38%, 7.3 months, and 25.7 months, respectively. In 27 patients also treated with ALKYs, the OR,
PFS, and OS were 30%, 13.0 months, and 59.9 months,
respectively. In 7 of 13 patients (54%), the MGMT gene
promoter was methylated tumor; in this group, the outcomes tended to be similar to those for the whole population, but because of the low number of patients, no
statistically significant result could be obtained.
DISCUSSION
This large study of 104 patients confirms the activity of
GEMOX in NETs. GEMOX was given here and in most

chemoembolization.17-21 In retrospective studies and
phase 2 studies (presented only in abstract form) of
oxaliplatin-based regimens for NETs, response rates were
reported to be between 17% and 30%, and the median
PFS was 7 to 14 months.17-21 In our study, the OR rate
and the PFS were 23% and 7.8 months, respectively, for
82% of the patients with PD before GEMOX. An interesting result of our study was the activity of GEMOX in
lung carcinoid tumors, about which very few data have
been available. No severe toxicities were observed in our
study, and this was in keeping with the good tolerance
previously reported by patients with NETs21 and other

cancers.24,25 Because GEMOX was discontinued after 8
consecutive cycles according to the usual guidelines for
the dose reduction of oxaliplatin,21 neurotoxicity was not
an issue in patients with NETs. Another advantage of
GEMOX over other chemotherapies is its capacity to be
administered in less than 3 hours in a chemo daycare unit;
this must be compared with the 46-hour 5-fluorouracil
infusion. No comparison is available for NETs between
GEMOX and other oxaliplatin-based regimens such as
capecitabine and oxaliplatin or folinic acid, fluorouracil,
and oxaliplatin. However, it is known that 5-fluorouracil26 and gemcitabine27 alone have low activity with
response rates of 0% in phase 2 studies in NETs.
After showing the efficacy of GEMOX in NETs, we
compared this treatment with standard chemotherapies
based on ALKYs. A comparison was possible for the 63
patients who received both types of regimens. Even
though the results should be interpreted with caution
because of the retrospective nature of this study, GEMOX
activity was found to be similar to ALKY activity in this
group of patients (OR, 22% vs 22%; PFS, 7.3 vs 7.5
months). OS was longer after ALKY treatments, but this
was difficult to interpret because these drugs were given as
an earlier line of treatment than GEMOX. Prospective
studies are clearly needed before oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy can be used upfront, but this regimen may be an
option for further lines, especially in patients with previous poor responses to ALKYs.
The MGMT status has been recently reported to be
a possible predictive factor of responses to ALKYs in
patients with NETs.26 In addition, MGMT polymorphisms have been previously reported to be correlated
with PFS in patients with advanced colorectal cancer
treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.28 We,
therefore, decided to verify our previous results11-13
about the role of MGMT in the prediction of responses

to ALKYs and to test its possible relevance to responses
to oxaliplatin. In keeping with our previous results, we
found in this new group of patients that MGMT promoter gene methylation was correlated with responses to
ALKYs. Patients with methylated MGMT NETs who
were treated with ALKYs had better outcomes than those
with unmethylated MGMT NETs (OR rate, 40% vs 6%;
PFS, 24 vs 7 months). In contrast, although MGMT
methylation was observed in 26% of NETs treated with
GEMOX, the response rate and the PFS were not modified by the MGMT status. OS seemed to be even worse
in patients with methylated NETs treated with
GEMOX: this reinforces the negative prognostic value
of MGMT methylation observed for gliomas10 and in
previous studies of NETs.13 In conclusion, GEMOX is
effective against NETs, and our data suggest that it could
be offered first to patients with unmethylated MGMT
tumors. Indeed, GEMOX activity is similar to the activity of ALKYs, but it is not influenced by the MGMT status. Although these results would need to be confirmed
in prospective, multicenter studies before the development of recommendations, the MGMT status could
prove to be a valuable tool in deciding between chemotherapy regimens based on ALKYs or oxaliplatin for
NETs.
