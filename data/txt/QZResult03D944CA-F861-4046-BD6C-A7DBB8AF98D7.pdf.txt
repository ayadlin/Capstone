ABSTRACT
The tumor microenvironment is emerging as a key regulator of cancer growth and
progression, however the exact mechanisms of interaction with the tumor are poorly
understood. Whilst the majority of genomic profiling efforts thus far have focused
on the tumor, here we investigate RNA-Seq as a hypothesis-free tool to generate
independent tumor and stromal biomarkers, and explore tumor-stroma interactions by
exploiting the human-murine compartment specificity of patient-derived xenografts
(PDX).
Across a pan-cancer cohort of 79 PDX models, we determine that mouse stroma
can be separated into distinct clusters, each corresponding to a specific stromal cell
type. This implies heterogeneous recruitment of mouse stroma to the xenograft
independent of tumor type. We then generate cross-species expression networks
to recapitulate a known association between tumor epithelial cells and fibroblast
activation, and propose a potentially novel relationship between two hypoxiaassociated genes, human MIF and mouse Ddx6. Assessment of disease subtype also
reveals MMP12 as a putative stromal marker of triple-negative breast cancer. Finally,
we establish that our ability to dissect recruited stroma from trans-differentiated
tumor cells is crucial to identifying stem-like poor-prognosis signatures in the tumor
compartment.
In conclusion, RNA-Seq is a powerful, cost-effective solution to global analysis of
human tumor and mouse stroma simultaneously, providing new insights into mouse
stromal heterogeneity and compartment-specific disease markers that are otherwise
overlooked by alternative technologies. The study represents the first comprehensive
analysis of its kind across multiple PDX models, and supports adoption of the approach
in pre-clinical drug efficacy studies, and compartment-specific biomarker discovery.

INTRODUCTION

metastasis [1], and is therefore emerging as rich source
of targets for anti-cancer therapy. However, we have a
poor understanding of the interactions between tumor
and stroma. A typical solid tumor tissue sample consists
of both components, and such sample heterogeneity can
have significant influence on the biological interpretation
of genomic profiling studies [2]. Furthermore, attempts

The tumor stroma comprises of numerous cell types
including endothelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts

as lymphocytes and tumor-associated macrophages. It

to separate tumor from stroma are hampered by the
requirement for specialist techniques such as laser capture
micro-dissection, with small amounts of tumor cell
contamination possible.
Patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models are
generated when fresh tumor tissue obtained directly from
patients is implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically
into immune-deficient mice. As such, they maintain the
principal histological, clinical and molecular characteristics
of the original patients’ tumors while remaining biologically
stable when passaged in mice [3–5]. Since PDX models
more closely resemble and recapitulate tumor growth in
humans than standard in vitro cell line or cell line xenograft
approaches, they remain key experimental platforms for
pre-clinical drug development.
Recent studies have shown that human and
mouse transcription can be accurately differentiated in
PDX models using RNA-Seq [6–7], removing the need
for manipulation of the RNA population, customised
sequencing protocols, or prior knowledge of the species
component ratio. Moreover, the known transcriptional
response to drugs targeting the stroma can be accurately
recapitulated in both human tumor and mouse stroma [6].
The high specificity of the in silico read disambiguation
approach means that gene expression in the human
component is quantified almost exclusively from tumor
RNA, particularly in later passages where the original
patient stroma has been replaced by mouse stroma. Thus
PDX transcriptome data provide a unique opportunity for
the simultaneous study of both tumor and stromal specific
signals in vivo. Consequently, several studies have adopted
the approach albeit restricted to only a small number of
xenograft models or specific cancer type [8–9].
In this paper, we build significantly on these early
studies by using RNA-Seq to profile the baseline human
and mouse transcriptome of 79 PDX models representing
multiple cancer types. By doing so, we assess mouse
stromal heterogeneity, generate hypotheses on the
relationship between mouse stroma and human tumor,
and identify both tumor and stromal specific markers of
disease subtype. To our knowledge, this represents the first
comprehensive analysis of both species components of
PDX models simultaneously across such a large cohort. As
such, the dataset should provide a key platform for gaining
additional insights into PDX tumor and stroma processes,
and interpreting pre-clinical efficacy studies.

demonstrated that low coverage (1.3–2.0 M reads) was
sufficient to deliver accurate detection and measurement of
mouse gene expression [6]. In this study we generated a
coverage of 5–10 M reads, which was considered sufficient
to generate a robust data set. Expression between technical
and biological replicates showed strong correlation
across both human (Figure S2A–S2C) and mouse (Figure
S2D–S2F) genes. Predicted stromal and immune
cell content using ESTIMATE [10] indicated a clear
differentiation between the human and mouse components,
and > 97% tumor purity in the human component of 76/79
samples (Figure S3, Table S3). As a proxy for the quantity
of original patient stroma in each PDX sample, human
expression levels of two CAF markers that are rarely
expressed by tumor epithelial cells, fibroblast activation
protein alpha (FAP) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4
(CSPG4), were assessed. 22/79 samples showed evidence
of patient stroma retention at a low stringency CAF marker
expression threshold (FAP or CSPG4 log2 FPKM > 2.0;
Table S3) and therefore flagged as potential confounders
in analyses of the human component. Of these, only 11
samples expressed high levels of either marker (log2
FPKM > 4.0), and overall results suggest human and mouse
transcriptional profiles reflect highly enriched human tumor
and mouse stroma cell populations respectively in the
majority of samples.

Mouse stroma heterogeneity is primarily driven
by dominant cell type
We applied non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
to cluster 14173 and 3933 of the most highly expressed
(human: FPKM > 10, mouse: FPKM > 2 in at least one
sample) and variable (coefficient of variation > 0.20) genes
across human and mouse respectively, and test whether
gene expression signatures exist in the mouse component
allowing separation into distinct subtypes. Stable clusters
were achieved at k = 9 (human; Figure 1B) and k = 5
(mouse; Figure 1D) where k denotes the number of clusters
and values selected according to the procedure outlined in
Methods. Model-to-cluster mappings for both human and
mouse are given in Tables S4A and S4B respectively, and
genes deemed as key drivers of the clustering (meta-genes)
are listed in Tables S5A (human) and S5B (mouse).
Human clusters were more strongly associated with
cancer type (p < 2.20E-16 by Chi-squared test; Figure 1C)
than the mouse clusters (p = 1.07E–5; Figure 1E). 8/15
and 7/11 tumors in human clusters 1 and 2 respectively
expressed CAF markers FAP/CSPG4, which may suggest
a propensity for some lung squamous and triple-negative
breast cancers (TNBC) to retain patient stroma.
Functional enrichment analysis using Toppgene
[11] revealed that 3/5 mouse clusters encompassed strong
functional themes associated with fat (cluster 1), muscle
(cluster 3) and immune cells (cluster 5; Figure 1F, Table S6)
corresponding to strong overlap with adipocyte
(p = 1.70E–16), embryonic stem (p = 2.14E–37), and

RESULTS
79 PDX models from five different providers covering
seven cancer types were used in the study (Figure 1A,
Table S1) with the majority of models representing lung
(37 models) and breast (19 models). A mean of 47,906,117
human and 6,612,995 mouse reads were uniquely mapped
to a concatenated human and mouse genome (Figure S1A,
Table S2), corresponding to a human component of ~88%
in each sample (Figure S1B, Table S2). We have previously

myeloid (p = 8.68E–28) cell type signatures respectively.
Cluster 2 was primarily driven by Col10a1 expression
(relative contribution to meta-gene = 0.89; Table S5B), a
potential marker of CD10+ tumor stromal cells [12], and
cluster 4 showed some enrichment for mesenchymal stem
cell markers (p = 1.01E–08).
The mean number of mapped mouse reads (Figure S4A)
or proportion of mouse component (Figure S4B) was not
significantly different between mouse clusters. Notably,
cluster 5 included samples from model HOXF060 with
the largest mouse component in the cohort (69.8%;
35,614,081 mapped reads), and HPAXF049 with one of
the lowest mouse components (7.5%; 3,109,853 mapped
reads). Despite the difference in coverage, high mouse gene
expression correlation was achieved between these samples
(r = 0.93; Figure S5), suggesting coverage was not a major
confounding factor. Furthermore, no significant association
was observed between the mouse clusters and mouse gender
(p = 0.10) or tumor stage (primary or metastatic; p = 0.55),
and only some association with mouse strain (p = 3.09E–04).
This was possibly driven by membership of all athymic
nude mice in clusters 1 and 4 (Figure 1E), otherwise, it was
difficult to discern possible influence of mouse strain on
dominant stromal cell type from these data alone.

Given the potential for heterogeneous recruitment
of mouse stroma to the human tumor, we next performed
a comprehensive expression correlation analysis between
human and mouse components to generate hypotheses on
tumor-stroma crosstalk. We initially looked for evidence
of a known tumor-stroma association, selecting the recent
observation that fibroblast activation is associated with
a tumor epithelial cell type [13]. Expression of human
epithelial cadherin (CDH1) and epithelial cell adhesion
molecule (EPCAM) were used as epithelial markers, and
mouse expression of fibroblast associated protein (Fap),
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (Cspg4) and alphasmooth muscle actin (Acta2) as CAF markers. In five of
the six possible cross-species comparisons, a significant
Pearson correlation coefficient (p < 0.05) was observed
between the human epithelial and mouse CAF markers
(Table 1; Figure S6A–S6F), particularly between EPCAM
and Fap (r = 0.37, p = 7.90E–4; Figure S6A) indicating the
positive relationship between tumor epithelial cell type and
fibroblast activation exists in the PDX panel. No significant
correlation was observed between the mouse CAF markers

or second neighbors of MIF in the network (Figure 2A) were
enriched for mitochondrial processes (p = 7.15E–05) and
oxidative phosphorylation (p = 1.72E–04), whereas mouse
genes neighboring Ddx6 were enriched for other RNA
binding genes (p = 3.93E–08). To test the association with
hypoxia more explicitly, models were divided into MIF high/
Ddx6 low (log2 FPKM human MIF > 11.5, mouse Ddx6
< 1.05) and MIF low/Ddx6 high (MIF < 7.0, Ddx6 > 1.8)
corresponding to possible hypoxic and normoxic samples
respectively (Table S9). Genes differentially expressed (log2
fold change (FC) > 1.50, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05)
between the two groups were then identified. According
to Toppgene, genes over-expressed in MIF high/Ddx6
low samples were enriched (p = 1.50E–06) for signatures
representing genes up-regulated under hypoxia in vivo [16].
Conversely, genes over-expressed in MIF low/Ddx6 high
samples were enriched (p = 5.09E–05) for genes downregulated in the same study, thus supporting the association
of high human MIF and low mouse Ddx6 expression with
tumor hypoxia.
Closer inspection of all possible inter- and intraspecies correlations between MIF and DDX6 (Figure 2C)
revealed no significant association (p < 0.01) between
human DDX6 and either human MIF (r = 0.23, p = 0.04),
mouse Ddx6 (r = −0.04, p = 0.75), or mouse Mif (r = −0.17,
p = 0.14). By contrast, human MIF and mouse Mif achieved
the second highest correlation (r = 0.72) between human and
mouse orthologs, suggesting that MIF has complementary
roles in the tumor and mouse stroma.

and two human mesenchymal cell type markers vimentin
(VIM) and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1;
Table 1), with Fap achieving weak anti-correlation with
both VIM (r = −0.20, p = 0.08) and ZEB1 (r = −0.21,
p = 0.06). Within the context of all correlations between
human CDH1 and 2495 most highly expressed and variable
mouse genes, both Fap and Cspg4 were ranked in the top
6% most correlated genes (Table S7). Notably, a significant
number of these top 6% genes play a role in cell migration
(p = 8.37E–13) and vasculature development (p = 3.12E–10),
both characteristic of an activated stroma, including the top
ranked gene collagen, type VIII, alpha 1 (Col8a1, r = 0.67;
Figure S7), a key component of blood vessel endothelia.
To explore potentially novel gene-wise associations
between human tumor and mouse stroma, an all-againstall comparison of 14,336 expression profiles representing
the most highly expressed and variable genes from both the
human (11,841 genes) and mouse (2495) components was
performed. The resulting co-expression network consisted
of 259,627 edges and 7089 nodes (Figure 2A) where
nodes represented genes and edges were drawn between
gene pairs achieving a stringent threshold of |r| > 0.85
(p < 2.20E–16) to control for false positives. The majority of
edges (256,922) were between positively correlated human
gene pairs, with the remainder of the network comprising of
2661 edges between mouse gene pairs, and 44 cross-species
anti-correlated gene pairs. The strongest cross-species
anti-correlation (r = −0.90) was observed between human
macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and mouse
DEAD-box RNA helicase 6 (Ddx6) (Figure 2B). In addition,
human MIF (connected to 17 mouse genes) and mouse
Ddx6 (connected to 8 human genes) represented the most
connected cross-species nodes in the network (Table S8).
Increased MIF expression and reduced DDX6
expression are both known drivers of angiogenesis and
strongly associated with VEGF activity, as such they have
been implicated in tumor response to hypoxia [14–15].

two most highly represented diseases in the PDX cohort,
in order to assess the potential of our approach to identify
clinically relevant, independent human tumor and mouse
stroma markers of disease subtype.

Stromal-specific markers of lung and breast
cancer subtype

(Figure 3A), significant over-expression in BTNBC was
detected in clinical samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas
[19] (TCGA; log2FC = 2.89, FDR = 2.67E–14) and the
Utah Breast Cancer Study (UBCS; log2FC = 2.56, FDR =
1.21E–02; Figure 3B). Thus significant fold changes appear
restricted to only those samples containing recruited stroma
(PDX mouse component, Finak_Stroma, and clinical tumor
samples), suggesting that MMP12 expression is specific to
BTNBC stroma, and absent in tumor cells.

Comparison between mouse components of 14
lung adenocarcinomas and 18 squamous carcinomas
identified no significantly differentially expressed genes,
suggesting uniform recruitment of mouse stroma to human
lung xenografts. By contrast, in the breast cancer panel,
18 mouse genes achieved significant fold change (|log2
FC| > 1.5, FDR < 0.05) between four ER+ luminal-B and
nine basal-like TNBCs (BTNBC; Table S10). Such a low
number of genes is in broad agreement with a dataset of
patient tumor stroma samples isolated by laser capture
micro-dissection (Finak_Stroma) [17] in which only
29 genes were differentially expressed (|log2 FC| > 1.5,
FDR < 0.05; Table S12). However, there was little overlap
between the two gene lists with matrix metallopeptidase
12 (Mmp12) the only gene over-expressed in both mouse
(log2FC = 2.00, FDR = 2.43E–02) and clinical (log2FC
= 2.83, FDR = 3.14E–09) stroma. Interestingly, whilst
MMP12 expression was largely absent in the PDX human
component (mean log2 FPKM = 0.44) and cell lines of the
Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia [18] (CCLE; mean log2
signal = 4.51) representing pure tumor cell populations

Tumor-specific markers of BTNBC
Exploiting the tumor purity of the PDX human
component, we derived a putative set of tumor-specific
BTNBC markers by comparing a list of 1127 genes overexpressed (log2FC > 1.5, FDR < 0.05) in BTNBC from the
PDX human component with 273 genes over-expressed
(log2FC > 1.5, p < 0.001) in cell lines. This resulted in
an overlap of 117 genes on platforms representing high
tumor content (Figure 3A). We then performed a second
overlap between this tumor-specific gene signature and
6156 differentially expressed genes detected in TCGA
and UBCS at FDR < 0.05 but ignoring fold change
magnitude. By doing so, we reasoned that genes unique

to the intersection between PDX and cell line datasets
represented BTNBC markers that could only be observed in
samples with high tumor purity, and overlooked in clinical
samples containing a mixture of tumor cells and recruited
stroma. Five genes fulfilled the criteria (Figure 3C):
transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB), CD44, tolllike receptor 3 (TLR3), anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1)
and lysyl oxidase (LOX). All five genes retained significant
differential expression after removal of five breast cancer
samples (HBCX10, HBCX11, HBCX24, HBCX6 and
HBCX9) expressing CAF markers FAP/CSPG4 in the
human component, addressing the possibility that persistent
retention of patient stroma in the BTNBC PDX models was
confounding results.
To reproduce the tumor purity of the PDX human
component and cell lines in clinical samples, we performed
a second comparison between 12 BTNBC and 10 ER+
luminal-B TCGA patients representing samples with
the highest estimated tumor cell content (ESTIMATE
stromal score < −700). Remarkably, significant differential
expression emerged in GPNMB (log2FC = 1.19, FDR =
1.18E–02) and LOX (log2FC = 2.07, FDR = 2.53E–05) with
the fold change of a third gene, ANTXR1 also increasing but
not to significance (log2FC = 0.74, FDR = 0.13; Figure 3D).
This suggests that at least two of the five genes are BTNBC
markers expressed in patient samples, whose significance is
masked by the difficulty of separating recruited stroma from
tumor cells of stromal phenotype.

(log2FC = 1.13, FDR = 2.15E–15) compared to that
observed from the PDX human component (log2FC = 4.49,
FDR = 2.18E–05). There was no enrichment of stromal or
mesenchymal cell markers in genes over-expressed across
either PDX or clincal ER+ luminal-B samples (Table 2;
Table S14). The BTNBC PDX human component was
also enriched for reactive stroma (p = 6.08E–04) and
breast CSC markers (p = 1.60E–04; Table 2; Table S14),
and whilst a high number of non-CSC markers were also
present, the enrichment was not significant (p = 0.53).
Furthermore, CD44, a marker for cells with tumor initiating
potential, was identified as a BTNBC marker in both PDX
(log2FC = 2.14, FDR = 5.91E–04) and cell line
(log2FC = 2.58, p = 8.66E–03) but not in clinical
(log2FC = 0.06, FDR = 0.79) datasets. Low CD24 expression
is also indicative of tumor initiating potential, however
human CD24 expression was not detected across any of the
PDX samples. Conversely, non-CSC markers were enriched
in genes over-expressed in PDX (p =1.26E–03) and TCGA
ER+ luminal-B samples (p = 1.29E–05).
Encouragingly, BTNBC markers remained enriched
for stromal (p = 3.30E–03), EMT (p = 4.17E–10), CSC
(p = 1.59E–03) and reactive stromal (p = 3.04E–03)
signatures (Figure 3F; Table 2; Table S14) after removal
of the five breast PDX models expressing CAF markers
FAP and CSPG4 suggesting the presence of stromallike signature genes in the PDX human component was
independent of patient stroma retention. Furthermore,
there was no evidence of bias towards mesenchymal or
mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) TNBC subtypes [23]
(Table S11), indeed no MSL or immunomodulatory (IM)
subtypes were present in the PDX data in accordance with
the view that these subtypes are likely defined by high
expression of genes from the micro-environment rather
than the tumor itself [24]. Therefore our observations are
unlikely due to over-representation of the stromal subtype
in PDX BTNBC models.

Tumor-specific BTNBC markers are enriched for
genes associated with a stromal phenotype
To gain further insight into potential BTNBC markers
derived from high tumor content samples, we next compared
1127 and 1368 genes over-expressed (log2FC > 1.5, FDR
< 0.05) in BTNBC from the PDX human component and
TCGA patient samples respectively. This resulted in an
overlap of 574 genes.
We initially speculated that the differences between
the lists could in part be attributed to the presence of
recruited stroma in typical clinical samples that is absent in
the PDX human component (Figure 3A), so we included
a 137-stromal gene signature [10] (Table S13A) in the
comparison. Surprisingly, we observed greater overlap
(p = 6.00E–04 by hyper-geometric test) of stromal signature
genes with BTNBC markers derived from the PDX human
component than those from clinical samples (p = 1.00;
Table 2; Figure 3E; Table S14). To understand whether this
overlap was indicative of specific cell type, we also overlaid
epithelial-mesenchymal transition [20] (EMT; Table S13B),
breast cancer stem cell [21] (CSC; Table S13C) and reactive
stromal [22] (Table S13D) signatures. Clear enrichment
(p = 7.77E–16) of mesenchymal markers including VIM
was observed in the BTNBC PDX human component.
By contrast, only a slight enrichment was observed
(p = 0.07) in clinical BTNBC samples and whilst
VIM achieved significant fold change, it was small
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Stromal phenotype emerges in BTNBC clinical
samples of high tumor content
As before, we reproduced the tumor purity of the
PDX human component in clinical samples by focusing
on TCGA samples with the lowest predicted stromal cell
content (ESTIMATE stromal score < −700). Remarkably,
enrichment of both EMT (p = 2.05E–07) and CSC
(p = 1.83E–02) signatures emerged in genes differentially
expressed between the remaining 12 BTNBC and 10 ER+
luminal B TCGA samples, comparable to that observed
in the PDX human component (Figure 4C). The numbers
of stromal and reactive stromal signature genes also
increased although not sufficient to achieve significance.
Taken together, these findings support the presence of
a subpopulation of cells with CSC and mesenchymal
features in BTNBC that is difficult to detect in a typical
clinical sample due to equivalent expression signals from
the recruited stroma.

DISCUSSION

and myeloid signatures, the latter indicating a high level
of inflammatory infiltrate in the mouse stroma. These were
independent of cancer type and PDX provider and suggest
heterogeneous recruitment of mouse stroma to the human
tumor. Since interaction between the tumor and stroma is
known to influence drug response, our findings imply that
the effect of the dominant stromal cell type in an individual
model should be considered when analyzing therapeutic
response. This is particularly pertinent for compounds that
may drive efficacy through stromal elements, or be subject
to stromal derived resistance. However, whilst the approach
provides the opportunity to explore the association of
stromal subtype and the degree of inflammatory infiltrate
with survival outcome and drug resistance, it is important
to characterize the models carefully. In this study of
commonly used models there was a notable enrichment of
high-grade tumors with poor prognosis [26], which will
influence the outcome of such studies.

We describe the output of a comprehensive
expression analysis of 79 pan-cancer PDX models using
an RNA-Seq generated species-specific mapping strategy.
Accurate separation of human and mouse components
of the tumor allows use of PDX tumors to gain unique
insights into tumor-stroma crosstalk, and through cross
comparison, generate both tumor and stroma expression
signatures that give insights specific to disease subtypes,
and also aid development of biomarker signatures. When
passaged in vivo much of the patient stroma present
upon implantation and early passages is eventually
replaced by murine stroma, and whilst this can lead to
loss of some original features found in the patient tumor
microenvironment [25], it is key to enabling non-invasive
species-specific separation of PDX tumor from stroma
in silico. Therefore, it offers a unique opportunity not only
to look at features specific to the stroma but also reveal
new biology within the human tumor cells.

and mouse component. This approach identified known
associations between tumor epithelial cell type and fibroblast
activation [13], exemplified by significant correlation
between human epithelial and mouse CAF markers. These
were amongst several mouse genes correlated with human
CDH1 including numerous endothelial-associated genes.
We then applied more stringent criteria to generate a crossspecies correlation network and identify novel associations.
The strongest relationship was an anti-correlation between
human MIF and mouse Ddx6. MIF plays an important
role in the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) activity promoting blood vessel growth [27],
and is also a target of the transcription factor hypoxiainducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) [14]. Conversely, DDX6
inhibits VEGF protein expression under normoxia through
binding to the 5′-UTR of its mRNA [15]. Our data suggest
a potential stromal role for DDX6 in the hypoxia response
as an alternative to its previously established tumor-specific
activity, and a potential link with MIF activity in the tumor.
Overall, our findings highlight the value of RNASeq as a sensitive approach to dissect the complex
interplay between both species compartments. However
there are two caveats. Firstly the original tumor-stroma
interactions in the patient are unlikely to be completely
recapitulated due to incompatibility of human and mouse
proteins, and the use of immune-compromised mice to
promote xenograft establishment. Whether this is major
caveat remains to be established. Whilst our results suggest
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

known interactions develop in PDX models, further work
will be necessary to establish a direct functional link in
any novel interaction suggested by these data alone, and
whether it represents a clinically relevant association or
one that is unique to the xenograft. Secondly, the majority
of tumors were implanted subcutaneously providing
an ectopic environment. Where technically achievable,
comparison with a more physiological implantation site
used in orthotopic engraftment may better recapitulate
the original patient stroma, and as such models become
more widely available, similar profiling studies should be
performed on these.

Stromal gene expression markers of cancersubtype
Compared to the transcriptional differences
observed between lung and breast cancer subtypes within
the human tumor component, typically involving >1000
genes, the differences between the mouse stroma were
small. Indeed, no mouse genes were deemed differentially
expressed between lung adenocarcinoma and squamous
mouse stroma, and only 18 mouse genes between breast
ER+ and TN. This suggests recruitment of mouse stroma
to the tumor is largely independent of disease subtype.
The search for stromal specific markers of BTNBC
also highlighted potential disparities between PDX mouse
and patient stroma. Whilst there was consensus in terms
20780

of fewer changes in stroma compared to tumor, only
MMP12, previously associated with breast cancer poor
prognosis [17] [28], was detected as a BTNBC marker
in both PDX mouse and patient stroma. The patient
stroma clearly reflected changes typically seen in the
tumor between TNBC and ER+ samples in agreement
with recent studies suggesting that intrinsic breast cancer
subtypes can be recapitulated based on the transcriptome
of cancer adjacent tissue [29–31]. By contrast, there
was no evidence of subtype reflected in the PDX stroma
transcriptome but instead genes differentially expressed in
PDX stroma were enriched in functions characteristic of
metastasis, a process common to BTNBC.
Whilst these results could reflect intrinsic differences
between the patient and mouse stroma, alternatively
they could be a consequence of the higher predicted
stromal cell purity achieved with our RNA-Seq approach
compared to laser capture micro-dissection. Therefore,
the specificity achieved by RNA-Seq in disambiguating
human from mouse could offer a significant advantage,
particularly in combination with a systematic integration
of clinical datasets such as TCGA to overcome limitations
of using mouse stroma. For example, evidence for
MMP12 as a BTNBC stromal marker was strengthened
by the observation that its expression is absent in samples
containing only tumor cells, but present in samples that
typically contain a significant stromal cell component.

uncovered a particularly aggressive sub-population of cells
analogous to CSCs residual after conventional treatments
[21] that are present in BTNBC but absent in ER+ luminal-B
patients. Critically, the observation that CSC and EMT
gene signatures emerge in BTNBC markers derived from a
dataset restricted to TCGA samples with the lowest stromal
cell content strongly suggests that the phenomenon is not
exclusive to PDX models, and counters the possibility that
CSCs are simply more successful at engrafting in the mouse
mammary microenvironment than other cell types [41].
We had two further concerns about our PDX breast
cancer dataset, firstly BTNBC is over-represented due to
the difficulty in establishing ER+ tumors in mice [42],
and secondly, despite the retention of poor prognosis
markers after removal of five BTNBC PDX models
expressing CAF markers, we could not completely rule
out the possibility of persistent patient stroma retention
confounding the above observations. If this is the case, the
presence of stromal-associated genes in the BTNBC PDX
human component could reflect the level of reactive stroma
in the original patient tumor. This indicates increased
metastatic capacity leading to disease progression and
poor prognosis, particularly in BTNBC [43]. Recently, a
study has shown that increased stroma has the opposite
effect in ER+ breast tumors [44], and although the results
have since been challenged [45], a bias towards aggressive
tumors with poor prognosis in PDX models could lead to
an enrichment of high stroma BTNBC and low stroma
ER+ luminal-B tumors in our breast cancer cohort and
the appearance of stromal-associated genes not present
in the clinical data. Indeed, ER+ luminal-B tumors are
themselves distinct from other ER+ subtypes due to their
aggressive phenotype and resistance to conventional
hormone therapy [46]. Therefore, the effect of excluding
mouse stroma is to reveal genes specific to the original
reactive stroma in the patient.
One further possibility was we had simply identified
the presence of a stromal-like BTNBC subtype, however
we found no evidence of bias towards mesenchymal or
MSL TNBC subtypes [23] in our breast xenografts, nor in
our TCGA/UBCS clinical samples of high tumor purity in
which the signature emerged.
Despite these concerns, the masking of key markers
of BTNBC by expression signals from recruited stroma
is a significant observation and clearly illustrates the
confounding effects of tumor sample heterogeneity
on differential expression measurements. Considering
the importance of the genes missed in the clinical
samples unless stromal recruitment is accounted for, our
observations have implications for any study that uses
clinical samples to derive cancer-associated signatures,
and potentially contribute to the poor overlap observed
between signatures derived from different studies. They
also demonstrate the potential of the RNA-Seq approach
to refine complex signatures whose source compartment
is ambiguous.

Expression signals from recruited stroma could
mask presence of poor prognosis markers in
BTNBC
A major outcome of the disease-specific analysis
was the identification of a BTNBC stromal signature in the
PDX human component, not detected in TCGA or UBCS
clinical samples. This was achieved through the ability of
RNA-Seq to differentiate the two major sources of cells
with a stromal phenotype in a typical xenograft sample,
trans-differentiated tumor cells [32] (human cells) and coopted/recruited stroma (mouse cells). In a patient sample,
this is difficult to accomplish with high confidence, even
with specialist techniques such as laser capture microdissection, highlighting the capacity of RNA-Seq to
refine complex signatures that are typically derived from
heterogeneous cell populations.
The enrichment of breast CSC markers, including
CD44, and EMT markers such as VIM supports previous
work that showed EMT and CSC phenotypes are more
likely to occur in basal breast cancers [33–34]. Notably,
CD44 was one of five genes previously associated with
BTNBC and poor prognosis that were clearly overexpressed in BTNBC PDX human and cell line samples but
not in clinical samples. Of the other four genes, TLR3 and
ANTXR1 are also CSC markers [35–36], whilst LOX and
GPNMB are metastatic markers of BTNBC [37–40]. Given
the phenotypes associated with these genes, we could have

CONCLUSIONS
This study has established RNA-Seq as a costeffective approach to enable simultaneous analysis of
human tumor and mouse stroma across a pan-tumor explant
panel. The analytical strategy provided new insights
into mouse stromal heterogeneity and compartmentspecific disease markers otherwise overlooked by other
technologies. Whilst further work is necessary to investigate
the clinical relevance of the findings, they highlight the use
of the technology as a platform to explore mouse stroma
recruitment to the human tumor, and, critically, how this
may influence therapeutic response. The strategy can also
be applied routinely in pharmacodynamic studies of PDX
models for detailed monitoring of compartment specific
changes after treatment, ultimately leading to better efficacy
prediction in the patient. As a resource for the pre-clinical
model research community, all gene-level human and mouse
expression data have been deposited in the ArrayExpress
database (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) under accession
number E-MTAB-3980.

BioBank (Portland, ME) and consented according to
the Human Biological Samples Policy. Samples were
received within 24 hours of surgery, minced and implanted
subcutaneously into either NSG or CB17 SCID mice. The
HBXF-079 sample was implanted orthotopically. The
CTC-174 model was developed from circulating tumor
cells in patient blood samples procured from Conversant
Biologics (Huntsville, AL) and consented according to the
Human Biological Samples Policy. The cells were isolated
and implanted into the mammary fat pad of NSG mice.
In addition, several models were purchased from Jackson
Laboratories (Sacramento, CA) as tumor-bearing NSG
mice. In most cases, the models were serially transplanted
into fresh NSG mice as fragments for expansion and
characterization, except BR0869F. For the remaining
models, small pieces of PDX derived tumor were
purchased specifically for profiling from Experimental
Pharmacology and Oncology (EPO; http://www.epoberlin.com), Xentech (http://www.xentech.eu) and
Champions (http://championsoncology.com) representing
athymic nude, SCID, or NSG mice (Table S1).

METHODS

RNA extraction

Ethics statement

~50 mg of tissue were cut from the frozen tumors
and RNA isolated using the Qiazol kit with a DNase
digestion using the RNase-free DNase Kit (Qiagen) on
the Qiacube according to manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA concentration was measured using the NanoDrop
ND1000 (NanoDrop), and quality determined using the
Agilent RNA nano 6000 kit and Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies). RNA integrity numbers (RIN) for all
samples fell between 7 and 10.

All animal studies were conducted in accordance
with U.K. Home Office legislation, the Animal Scientific
Procedures Act 1986, as well as the AstraZeneca Global
Bioethics policy. All experimental work is outlined in
project license 40/3483, which has gone through the
AstraZeneca Ethical Review Process. Studies in the
United States were conducted in accordance with the
guidelines established by the internal IACUC (Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee) and reported following
the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting in vivo
experiments) guidelines.

RNA-Seq data
RNA libraries were made with the Illumina TruSeq
RNA Sample Preparation kit (un-stranded) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. These libraries were then
submitted for 100 bp paired-end sequencing on the Illumina
HiSeq 2000 platform using one lane per three to six PDX
models. A concatenated human (GRCh37/hg19) and mouse
(GRCm38/mm9) genome was then constructed to form a
single genome of 43 chromosomes (23 from human and
20 from mouse). This was indexed using StarAlign [48]
and a “gtf” formatted file combining annotations from
both human and mouse genes downloaded from Ensembl
version 75 [47]. The length of donor/acceptor sequence
(“sjdbOverhang”) either side of a splice junction was set
to 99 bases, with all other parameters set to their defaults.
The sequenced reads were aligned to the human-mouse
genome using StarAlign [48] with no more than three
mismatches across each end of the pair allowed, and reads
mapped to multiple locations discarded. Reads whose ratio
of mismatches to mapped length was greater than 0.10,
and non-canonical splice junctions were also removed. All
other parameters were set to their defaults for non-stranded

Animals
Female C.B.-17 severe combined immunodeficient
(SCID) mice were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). NOD/SCID/IL2Rγnull
(NSG) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories
(Bar Harbor, ME). Beige Nude XID mice were purchased
from Harlan Laboratories (Madison, WI). Mice were
housed under pathogen-free conditions in individual
ventilated cages (IVC) at our Association for the
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care (AAALAC) accredited facility in Waltham, MA.
All animal manipulations were conducted in a biosafety
cabinet maintained under positive pressure.

PDX model establishment
In-house PDX models were established from fresh
patient tissue procured from Maine Medical Center

alignment. Since we only considered reads uniquely mapped
to the human-mouse genome according to the mapping
parameters above, reads mapping to both human and mouse
genomes were automatically discarded. Therefore, the
output of the pipeline was a set of species-specific reads
that mapped uniquely either to the human or mouse genome.

PDX models
PDX model hormone receptor status was determined
by immunohistochemistry, and broadly correlated with
mRNA expression. Nine of the 10 TNBC PDX samples
were basal-like and all four ER+ PDX samples luminal-B
according to PAM50 classification [52] (Table S10) therefore
comparisons were restricted to these two intrinsic subtypes.
TNBC subtypes listed in Table S11A were predicted using
TNBCtype [53] with FPKM expression values as input.
Two tumors (HBCX7 and HBCX19) that had undergone
metastasis were ignored. Differentially expressed genes
were identified using the R Bioconductor package DESeq2
[54]. “minReplicatesForReplace” was set to seven or size
of the smallest group if one group contained less than seven
samples. All other parameters were set as defaults. Only
genes achieving FPKM > 1 in at least one sample were
input to DESeq2. Differential expressed genes were defined
as those achieving a |log2FC| > 1.5 and FDR < 0.05.

Measurement of expression level
The number of reads overlapping each gene
present in both human (GRCh37) and mouse (GRCm38)
annotation files downloaded from Ensembl version 75 [47]
were calculated using the R Bioconductor package HTSeq
[49] in un-stranded, union mode with all other parameters
set to default values. For the same group of genes,
expression based on Fragments Per Kilobase per Million
fragments mapped (FPKM) was estimated using Cuffnorm
with library type defined as “fr-unstranded” and all other
parameters set to defaults [50]. Non-protein coding genes
were ignored, as well as genes whose largest transcript
is less that 400 bp due to potential over-estimation
of expression across transcripts less than the average
fragment length. For PDX model BR0555 represented by
two biological and three technical replicates, the replicate
whose mouse component achieved the highest ESTIMATE
stromal score was chosen for downstream analyses.
Where required, mouse genes names were converted to
human and vice versa using MammalHom (http://depts.
washington.edu/l2l/mammalhom.html).

Patient stroma
Agilent-012391 Whole Human Genome Oligo
Microarray G4112A expression data for a set of 45 human
breast cancer samples whose stroma had been isolated
from the tumor by laser micro-dissection [17] were
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus [55]
(GSE9014). Raw expression data in the Agilent Feature
Extraction text files were loess normalized and differential
expression between seven TNBC and 38 ER+ samples
calculated using the R Bioconductor package Limma [56].
Probesets achieving a |log2FC| > 1.5 and FDR < 0.05 were
deemed differentially expressed.

Clustering of gene expression data with
consensus non-negative matrix factorization
(NMF)
We applied NMF to cluster the human and mouse
transcriptomes and identify tumor and stromal specific
subtypes respectively. The underlying principle of NMF
is dimensionality reduction in which a small number of
meta-genes, each defined as a positive linear combination
of the genes in the expression data, are identified and
then used to group samples into clusters based on the
gene expression pattern of the samples as positive
linear combinations of these meta-genes. Using the R
package NMF [51], factorization rank k was chosen by
computing the clustering for k = 2–11 against 50 random
initializations of both the actual and a permuted gene
expression matrix, and selecting the k value achieving
the largest difference between cophenetic correlation
coefficients calculated from the actual and permutated
data (Figure S8). For further visual confirmation of a
sensible choice of k, consensus matrices were generated
corresponding to different k values (Figure S9). To achieve
stability, the NMF algorithm was then run against 200
perturbations of each gene expression matrix at the chosen
values of k = 9 (human) and k = 5 (mouse).

UBCS
Fresh frozen breast tissue samples were obtained
from 88 women who had surgery at the Huntsman Cancer
Hospital from 2009–2012, including tumor tissues from
69 breast cancer patients. One tumor sample yielded
poor quality RNA (RIN = 2.5) and was removed from
consideration, resulting in a panel of 68 tumor samples.
RNA libraries were made with the Illumina TruSeq
Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit with oligo
dT selection according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
These libraries were then submitted for 50 bp single-end
sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform using
eight samples per lane. The resulting reads were aligned to
the human (GRCh37/hg19) genome using StarAlign [48]
with no more than three mismatches and only uniquely
mapped reads allowed. Reads whose ratio of mismatches to
mapped length was greater than 0.10 were also discarded.
All other parameters were set to their defaults for stranded
alignment. The number of reads overlapping each gene

present in the human (GRCh37) annotation file downloaded
from Ensembl version 75 [47] were calculated using the
R Bioconductor package HTSeq [49] in stranded, union
mode with all other parameters set to default values. The
resulting gene-by-sample matrix consisted of 12 ER+
luminal B and 10 BTNBC samples. TNBC subtypes listed
in Table S11B were predicted using TNBCtype [53] with
FPKM expression values as input. Differentially expressed
genes (|log2FC| > 1.5 and FDR < 0.05) were identified with
DESeq2 [54] using the same protocol applied to the PDX
models.

The EMT signature was taken from [20] consisting of
144 human (141 mouse) genes up-regulated and 156 human
(142 mouse) genes down-regulated in EMT according to
[20]. The breast CSC signature was based on the CD44+/
CD24−/low-mammosphere (MS) signature of [21] using 90
up-regulated and 211 down-regulated human genes.

Mouse gender predictions
All genes on the Y chromosome were identified,
and pseudogenes and genes achieving a count of < 1000
reads across all models were removed. The remaining
genes were manually inspected, and those with
evidence of expression across all models and therefore
not following the profile of the majority of genes were
also removed. Genes contributing to the mouse gender
prediction consisted of Eif2s3y, Ddx3y, Kdm5d and Uty.
Read counts across these genes were summed for all
models and the results divided by the total read count
across all genes and multiplied by 1000 to give a Y index.
Mice achieving Y index > 10 were classified as male, and
female otherwise.

TCGA
TCGA gene expression data (June 2014) processed
using the RNASeqv2 pipeline were downloaded from the
Broad Institute GDAC Firehose (http://gdac.broadinstitute.
org) and parsed to generate a gene-by-sample matrix of
raw counts across solid tumor samples only. Breast cancer
samples treated with tamoxifen were discarded as were
genes achieving a mean count < 1 across all remaining
samples. The resulting matrix consisted of 18,488 genes
across 79 luminal B ER+ and 54 TNBC samples as classified
by TCGA Network [19] by PAM50 [52]. TNBC subtypes
given in Table S11C were taken from [56]. Differential
expression was calculated using DESeq2 [54] as for the
PDX models.

CCLE
RMA normalized Affymetrix U133+2 expression
data was downloaded from CCLE [18], and all non-breast
cancer cell lines were removed as well as cell lines for
which subtype was ambiguous according to [58]. Since
no PDX or TCGA basal-like samples were classified as
claudin-low, these were removed from the cell line cohort.
The resulting gene-by-sample matrix consisted of 12 ER+
luminal B and seven BTNBC samples. TNBC subtypes
given in Table S11D were taken from [23]. Genes
achieving |log2FC| > 1.5 and T-test p-value < 0.01 were
defined as differentially expressed.
Note that for cross-platform comparisons, we
considered only a core set of 15,984 genes represented on
all platforms.

Expression data preparation for clustering and
cross-species correlation analysis
Gene-by-sample expression matrices were generated
for each species in which only genes achieving FPKM > 10
(human genes) or FPKM > 2 (mouse genes) in at least one
sample, and coefficient of variation > 0.20 were retained. The
resulting matrix of FPKM expression values was converted
to a non-negative matrix by addition of an arbitrary value of
1.1 to each entry and then taking log2 of the result.
