Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibition in Patients With Non–Small Cell
Lung Cancer: Is This Still a Valid Target for Therapy?
Shirish M. Gadgeel, MD

The link between chronic inflammation and cancer is well recognized and was first proposed by Virchow in 1863.1 He
observed leukocytes at tumor sites and suggested that this “lymphoreticular” infiltrate at sites of chronic inflammation was
connected to the development of cancers. The link between inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer and chronic
hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as chronic gastritis induced by Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric cancer are well recognized observations that support this proposal.1 It has also been proposed that lung cancer in smokers is
linked to the chronic inflammation induced by reactive oxygen species in the cigarette smoke.2 Chronic inflammatory
states are characterized by repeated tissue injury followed by attempts at tissue repair. This cycle of repeated injury and
repair can promote features of carcinogenesis such as DNA damage, cellular proliferation, and cell survival.
The role of inflammation in the development of cancer was further supported by epidemiologic studies that suggested a reduced incidence of several cancers in individuals taking aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) regularly.3 NSAIDs exert their antiinflammatory effects primarily by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme
(COX). COX exists in 2 isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2.4 COX-1 has constitutive activity in nearly all cells and is involved
in several homeostatic functions such as maintaining gastric mucosal integrity and resisting the activity of gastric acid, normal renal tubular function, and platelet function. COX-2 is the inducible form of the enzyme, and is not expressed in the
majority of normal tissues but is upregulated in inflammatory tissues and many cancers in response to cytokines, growth
factors, and hormones. COX-2–derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the primary mediator of inflammation and appears
to have tumor-promoting properties, including tumor invasion, resistance to apoptosis, angiogenesis, and suppression of
host immunity.5-7 Preclinical studies have suggested that inhibition of COX-2 can result in a reduction in tumor growth
in several cancers, including non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).8-10
With the introduction of selective COX-2 inhibitors, there was an expectation that the inducible isoform of the
COX enzyme can be targeted for both antiinflammatory and potentially anticancer properties while sparing the protective
effects of the COX-1 isoform. COX-2 inhibitors were therefore evaluated for both cancer prevention and anticancer therapy. Celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, was evaluated in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, a genetic condition
resulting from mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene that leads to multiple adenomatous polyps with a
nearly 100% risk of colon cancer. Preclinical studies have suggested that despite the presence of a mutation in the APC
gene, blocking the activity of COX-2 and the production of PGE2 can prevent development of the adenomatous polyps.
These preclinical results were confirmed in a randomized trial, in which celecoxib administered for 6 months demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.11 Subsequently,
celecoxib also was found to result in a reduction in the incidence of advanced adenomas, the lesions with the highest risk
of developing into colon cancer, in patients with a history of sporadic colonic adenomas.12 Despite this proof of concept
that COX-2 inhibitors can reduce the growth and incidence of precancerous lesions, the initial enthusiasm for celecoxib
and other COX-2 inhibitors as cancer preventive agents has been tempered by the lack of absolute selectivity in the clinical
setting and the elevated risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic adverse events.13
Both the preclinical data and the promising clinical data regarding cancer prevention generated interest in evaluating
COX-2 inhibitors in patients with advanced cancers, including NSCLC. Several studies suggested that COX-2 inhibitors
can enhance the activity of chemotherapy agents.14,15 In addition, several laboratory studies have demonstrated that there
was an overlap between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and COX-2 pathways and that the COX-2 pathway

may play a role in resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs).16,17 These studies also demonstrated
that the addition of a COX-2 inhibitor can augment the
antitumor efficacy of an EGFR TKI. Therefore, many
clinical trials were conducted evaluating the addition of a
COX-2 inhibitor to both chemotherapy agents and to
EGFR TKIs in patients with advanced NSCLC.18-23
Almost none of these studies demonstrated a benefit from
the addition of COX-2 inhibitors in unselected patients
with NSCLC. These results prompted a search for an
appropriate biomarker with which to identify those
patients most likely to benefit from COX-2 inhibitors.
Because PGE2 is a labile eicosanoid, measuring levels of PGE2 in the serum is challenging and can be misleading. To the best of our knowledge, Oates et al were
among the first to propose that the measurement of stable
urinary prostaglandin E metabolite (PGEM) would provide an indirect measure of COX-2 activity and prostaglandin production in patients. Furthermore, they
hypothesized that because COX-2 is an inducible enzyme,
nearly all the PGEM in the urine is likely to be a result of
PGE2 production in a patient’s tumor.18,24 The usefulness of urinary PGEM as a biomarker for selecting
patients who are most likely to benefit from COX-2
inhibitors was first tested in a single-arm trial of the combination of celecoxib and docetaxel in patients with recurrent NSCLC.18 In this trial, the results in the overall
population were no better than those observed among
patients treated with docetaxel alone. The investigators
analyzed urinary PGEM levels in patients enrolled on the
trial and found that the levels were higher than those
observed in the general population but with a high degree
of interpatient variability. Among 44 patients in whom
urinary PGEM levels were assessed, the investigators
found the highest survival (median, 15 months) in 11
patients who had the largest decline (>72% decline) in
urinary PGEM levels compared with patients whose levels
demonstrated less of a decline (median, 6.3 months) or
patients whose levels increased (median, 5.0 months). On
multivariate analysis, the only factor found to be associated with survival was a decline in urinary PGEM levels.
These data suggest that the activity of COX-2 in the
tumors of patients, as assessed by urinary PGEM levels,
can be variable and that the extent of inhibition of COX-2
activity with celecoxib differs among patients. In addition,
these data also suggest that survival is improved among
patients treated with COX-2 inhibitors who experience a
significant decline in urinary PGEM levels.
Reckamp et al have pursued the issue of inflammation and lung cancer for several years and they should be

commended for their work, which has resulted in the publication of their randomized trial evaluating the addition
of celecoxib to erlotinib for the treatment of patients with
advanced NSCLC in this issue of Cancer.25 Previously,
these investigators conducted a phase 1 trial focused on
defining the optimal biologic dose of celecoxib in combination with erlotinib, based on declines in urinary PGEM
levels.26 They found that a decline in urinary PGEM levels was correlated with dose and at a dose of 600 mg twice
daily, they observed a decline in the urinary PGEM levels
of 87%, which was significantly greater than the decline
observed at the standard dose of 400 mg twice daily.
These results form the basis of their current trial.25
In the current trial, the investigators randomized
patients with advanced NSCLC to treatment with either
erlotinib with placebo or erlotinib with celecoxib. The
study had 2 primary endpoints: progression-free survival
(PFS) in all patients and PFS in patients with elevated
baseline urinary PGEM levels. The results demonstrated a
trend toward improved PFS with the combination of erlotinib and celecoxib for the intent-to-treat population and
a significant improvement in PFS for patients with elevated baseline urinary PGEM levels. The improvement
observed in patients with elevated baseline urinary PGEM
levels has to be viewed with a level of caution because the
statistical design had a very low threshold for benefit, with
a 1-sided significance level of .2, suggesting that the probability of the results being false-positive is not trivial. In
addition, the investigators did not provide information
regarding the changes in urinary PGEM levels after the
initiation of therapy. Although in their earlier phase 1
study they found a significant decline in urinary PGEM
levels with the use of celecoxib at the dose of 600 mg twice
daily, it is possible that in this larger set of patients the
decline in urinary PGEM levels may not have been uniform. It is unclear whether the analysis of patients who
experienced a significant decline in urinary PGEM levels
would have shown a greater improvement in PFS with the
combination compared with patients receiving erlotinib
and placebo.
Should these results prompt further testing of COX2 inhibitors in patients with NSCLC, specifically those
patients with baseline elevated urinary PGEM levels, as
suggested by the investigators? The totality of the data
regarding COX-2 inhibitors in patients with NSCLC
raises skepticism concerning the therapeutic relevance of
this target for the treatment of patients with advanced
NSCLC. Clearly, earlier trials suffered from the lack of a
defined biomarker. However, more recent trials based on
a defined biomarker have failed to demonstrate a clinical

benefit from the addition of a COX-2 inhibitor. Gitlitz
et al randomized patients with NSCLC who were selected
based on at least a 50% decline in urinary PGEM levels,
after a run-in period with apricoxib (another COX-2 inhibitor), to erlotinib with or without apricoxib.27 Despite
the selection of patients, their study failed to demonstrate
an improvement with the addition of apricoxib. A criticism regarding the study is that a 50% decline in urinary
PGEM levels was a low threshold with which to identify
patients with tumors that could benefit from COX-2
inhibitors. Similar results were observed by Edelman et al
when apricoxib was combined with chemotherapy in
patients with recurrent NSCLC who experienced a
decline in urinary PGEM levels after a run-in period.28
Edelman et al recently reported the results of a randomized phase 3 study evaluating the addition of celecoxib to
frontline platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with
tumors that had elevated COX-2 expression.29 This study
was based on a randomized phase 2 study conducted by
the same investigators that demonstrated an improvement
in survival with the addition of celecoxib in patients with
tumors that had elevated COX-2 expression.19 However,
the randomized phase 3 study failed to demonstrate an
improvement in survival with the addition of celecoxib.29
The investigators have conducted an exploratory analysis
based on baseline urinary PGEM levels. Although data
currently are available for only approximately 66% of the
patients, the investigators did find a trend toward
improved survival in patients with elevated baseline urinary PGEM levels. If the final analysis, which is based on
all enrolled patients, continues to demonstrate an
improvement in survival in patients with elevated baseline
urinary PGEM levels, the results would be consistent with
the results from the current study by Reckamp et al25 and
may justify further testing of COX-2 inhibitors based on
this biomarker.
The clinical data with COX-2 inhibitors in patients
with advanced NSCLC have raised several issues regarding the pathway and the therapeutic use of these drugs.
First, COX-2 inhibitors have demonstrated significant
benefit in individuals with precancerous lesions but have
failed to show benefit in patients with advanced cancer,
thereby raising the possibility that this pathway has relevance in earlier stages of carcinogenesis but may not be as
relevant in more advanced stages of cancer. Second, it is
unclear whether COX-2 inhibitors were partnered with
appropriate drugs for the treatment of patients with
NSCLC. The activity of EGFR TKIs in patients with
NSCLC with wild-type EGFR tumors is fairly modest
and therefore the addition of COX-2 inhibitors is unlikely

to provide a significant clinical benefit. PGE2 is known to
induce immune tolerance in the tumor microenvironment. Recently, COX-2 inhibitors were combined with
anti-programmed cell death 1 drugs in a mouse model of
chronic viral infections and this led to enhanced T-cell
response and improved viral control.30 Based on these
data and the promising results observed with antiprogrammed cell death 1 drugs in patients with NSCLC,
it is possible that such a combination may provide a significant clinical benefit in patients with NSCLC. Third, the
question remains whether COX-2 inhibitors are the most
efficient drugs with which to inhibit the carcinogenic
properties of PGE2 and whether selective PGE2 inhibitors could provide better inhibition of the pathway and
therefore greater clinical benefit.31,32
It has been proposed that chronic inflammation creates a microenvironment that induces and sustains a malignant phenotype. Effectively inhibiting the mediators of
chronic inflammation could potentially enhance the ability to reverse and possibly eliminate malignant tumors.
Despite the promising results presented by Reckamp
et al,25 it is unclear whether COX-2 is the most appropriate target with which to inhibit the chronic inflammatory
state in the tumor microenvironment for therapeutic
benefit.
