Hedgehog Fights Back: Mechanisms of Acquired Resistance
against Smoothened Antagonists
Ciara Metcalfe and Frederic J. de Sauvage

Abstract
Acquired resistance to targeted therapies threatens the value of these otherwise very promising agents.
The recent description of resistance to the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor vismodegib (GDC-0449) in a
medulloblastoma patient who had a dramatic initial response has spurred efforts to understand potential
mechanisms of drug resistance. Elucidating these mechanisms will play a significant role in informing
strategies to overcome this meaningful limitation. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5057–61. Ó2011 AACR.

Introduction
The development of targeted molecular therapies, together
with a growing emphasis on identifying patient populations
most likely to respond to these therapies, is dramatically
changing the landscape of medical oncology. However, as
the field of targeted therapies matures, we are being forced
to acknowledge an unfortunate but recurring theme: acquired
drug resistance. It is becoming clear that understanding and
even anticipating mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies, and developing strategies to overcome them, will be
critical for achieving long-term efficacy of targeted anticancer
molecules in patients.
The theme of acquired drug resistance is particularly prevalent in the context of kinase inhibitors. Multiple mechanisms
of resistance have been documented for a wide array of kinase
antagonists, including imatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that is
perhaps the most intensively studied resistance model; erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor;
and more recently crizotinib, an EML4-ALK inhibitor (1, 2). The
recent introduction of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitor
vismodegib (also known as GDC-0449) to the clinic led to the
first report of resistance against a therapy targeting Smoothened (SMO), and thus extended the paradigm of acquired drug
resistance to G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)–like molecules (3). This review focuses on mechanisms of resistance
against Hh pathway inhibitors targeting SMO.

Hh Signaling Is an Enticing Therapeutic Target

appears to play limited roles in adult homeostasis. In the

resting state, the 12-pass transmembrane receptor Patched
(PTCH) suppresses the activity of SMO, a GPCR-like molecule.
The Hh ligand activates the pathway by binding to PTCH and
releasing its inhibition over SMO, which subsequently signals
to the GLI family of transcription factors and induces a change
in the transcriptional profile of the cell (ref. 4; Fig. 1).
Inappropriate activation of the Hh pathway is associated with
cancer, a relationship that is best demonstrated in basal cell
nevus (Gorlin) syndrome. Patients with Gorlin syndrome
harbor germline mutations in PTCH1 that drive hyperactivation of the Hh pathway and are responsible for the development of numerous basal cell carcinomas throughout the
lifetime of the patient (5). Patients with Gorlin syndrome
are also predisposed to other types of cancer, in particular
medulloblastoma, a tumor of cerebellar granule neuron progenitor cells. Analyses of sporadically occurring basal cell
carcinomas and medulloblastomas have further highlighted
a role for Hh signaling in these tumor types: Deregulation of
PTCH1 contributes to hyperactive Hh signaling in the majority
of sporadically occurring basal cell carcinomas, with activating mutations in SMO occurring in ~10% of cases (6). In
medulloblastoma, the most common brain malignancy in
young children, approximately one third of cases exhibit
hyperactive Hh signaling due to mutations in components
of the Hh pathway (7). In addition, mouse models have been
used to reveal a causative role of the Hh pathway in medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma; for example, mice heterozygous for Ptch (Ptchþ/) were shown to spontaneously
develop medulloblastoma (8).
The fact that hyperactive Hh signaling is clearly a driving
force in medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma makes
it a particularly enticing therapeutic target, much like hyperactive EGFR signaling made it a target of choice in non–small
cell lung cancer (9). Adding to the considerable appeal of
the Hh pathway as a therapeutic target is the discovery that
cyclopamine, a natural compound derived from corn lilies
that causes teratogenic effects in lambs, inhibits the Hh
pathway by binding to SMO, providing evidence that the
Hh pathway is amenable to inhibition by exogenous compounds (10). More recently, high-throughput screening of

Figure 1. Multiple elements contribute to acquired resistance against SMO antagonists. In cases of medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma, loss of
PTCH1 results in aberrant, ligand-independent activation of SMO, leading to hyperactivation of the Hh pathway and associated tumorigenesis. Inhibition of
SMO in such contexts is thus an enticing therapeutic strategy, and a number of SMO antagonists are currently under investigation in clinical trials
(listed above). Mutation of SMO, amplification of the downstream Hh signaling molecule GLI2, and amplification of the Hh target gene CCND1 have been
identified as potential mechanisms leading to resistance against SMO antagonists. Another potential resistance mechanism is upregulation of the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. The details of how PI3K pathway activation might contribute to the reemergence of disease after acquired
resistance to SMO antagonists are not yet known, and the mechanism by which the PI3K pathway might be activated in the context of Hh-driven disease
remains to be determined. Intriguingly, though, the IGFR ligand IGF2 is reportedly upregulated in response to Hh pathway activation and is required for
progression of medulloblastoma in Ptch1 heterozygous mice (21).

small-molecule libraries, together with medicinal chemistry
efforts, led to the identification of additional Hh pathway
inhibitors with enhanced pharmacologic properties. A number of these Hh antagonists are currently under investigation
in clinical trials (11; see also Fig. 1).

Targeting the Hh Pathway Induced a
Remarkable but Transient Clinical Response in
a Metastatic Medulloblastoma Patient
Vismodegib, a potent synthetic oral SMO inhibitor that was
generated through intensive medicinal chemistry efforts, is
one such compound that is currently under clinical evaluation (12). Vismodegib treatment of a medulloblastoma
patient who harbored widespread metastatic disease resulted
in a rapid and dramatic tumor regression, seemingly at all

tumor sites, which was associated with significant pain
reduction and weight gain (3). Analysis of the patient's
primary and metastatic tumors taken prior to treatment
revealed a somatic mutation in PTCH1 (PTCH1–W844C),
as well as upregulated expression of Hh target genes, supporting the premise that the disease was driven by hyperactivation of the Hh pathway. Despite the robust initial
response, positron emission tomography scans taken ~3
months after initiation of treatment showed evidence of
tumor regrowth at multiple sites. The patient was removed
from the phase I study, and the disease then progressed
quickly despite a series of subsequent therapies (3). This case
study highlights the significant therapeutic advantage that
may be gained by targeting the Hh pathway in appropriate
contexts, but also brings to light the harsh reality of acquired
resistance to SMO-targeted therapies.

Acquired Resistance against Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitors

To explore the mechanisms of acquired resistance to vismodegib, Yauch and colleagues (13) analyzed a sample from a
progressing lesion taken from the medulloblastoma patient to
assess the status of known components of the Hh pathway.
Sequencing of PTCH1 confirmed the presence of the previously detected PTCH1-W844C mutation, which was accompanied by loss of heterozygosity. Intriguingly, in addition to
the PTCH1 mutation, they identified a SMO mutation, a
heterozygous G-to-C missense mutation at position 1697 that
is predicted to change codon 473 from Asp to His (D473H).
SMO-D473H was not detected in the pretreatment biopsies,
although it is possible that the mutation was present at a
frequency below detection levels. Alternatively, it may have
arisen at a tumor site different from the one initially biopsied
and reseeded all of the metastatic sites following the initial
response to vismodegib. In vitro analysis of SMO-D473H
indicated that this mutant is competent to transduce the
Hh signal and is likely not inherently oncogenic; like SMO-WT,
its activity is blocked by expression of PTCH1 (13). However,
further investigation showed that, unlike SMO-WT, SMOD473H is refractory to inhibition by vismodegib. Of note, loss
of sensitivity of SMO-D473H to vismodegib was accompanied
by a loss of physical interaction between the drug and SMO
(13). This mechanism of drug resistance (i.e., a deficiency in
drug-target binding conferred by a single amino acid change)
is analogous to the frequently detected BCR-ABL T315I substitution that is responsible for imatinib resistance in chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) patients (14).

Second-Generation Antagonists May Combat
Resistance Driven by SMO mutations
One approach to overcoming resistance generated by specific mutations in the drug target is to develop second-generation inhibitors that retain activity in the presence of the
resistance mutation. This strategy has been used with some
success in the case of both EGFR and BCR-ABL resistance
mutations; for example, nilotinib, a second-generation inhibitor of the ABL kinase, was shown to have clinical activity in
imatinib-resistant CML patients (15). An effort to identify
second-generation SMO antagonists that display activity in
vismodegib-resistant tumors revealed that HhAntag (a benzimidazole) exhibited a similar degree of efficacy in its inhibition of SMO-WT and SMO-D473H (16). In addition, a member
of the bis-amide class of SMO inhibitors (compound 5)
showed activity against vismodegib-resistant SMO in both
cell-based assays and a vismodegib-resistant mouse model
(described below), supporting the possibility of developing
second-generation inhibitors of mutant SMO (16).
An attractive alternative is the use of antagonists with a
mechanism of action clearly distinct from that of vismodegib.
Itraconazole, a systemic azole antifungal agent that targets
cytochrome P450, was recently shown to inhibit Hh signaling,
although it is significantly less potent than the pathway
inhibitors currently in clinical development (17). Itraconazole
purportedly acts on SMO by a mechanism distinct from that of
cyclopamine, although exactly how it functions remains to be

www.aacrjournals.org

determined. Considering this distinct mode of binding, it is
possible that itraconazole will retain its efficacy against
vismodegib-resistant SMO mutants. The use of antagonists
that target the Hh pathway downstream of SMO, such as
GANT61, which blocks GLI function, is likewise an appealing
therapeutic strategy in the context of resistance driven by SMO
mutations (18).

Mouse Models of Hh Pathway Inhibitor
Resistance Faithfully Recapitulate the Scenario
Seen in the Medulloblastoma Patient, and Point
to Alternative Mechanisms of Resistance
Downstream of SMO
Mouse models have proved to be useful for exploring
other potential mechanisms of resistance to SMO antagonists.
In one study (13), medulloblastoma tumors arising in
Ptchþ/p53/ mice were implanted s.c. into nude mice
and intermittently challenged with vismodegib until the
tumors stopped responding to twice-daily dosing. In a separate study (19), a similar approach was used to generate
allograft mouse models resistant to NVP-LDE225, a potent
and selective oral SMO antagonist from a newly described
structural class. Intermittent (suboptimal) dosing of vismodegib was required to generate resistant tumors that emerged
~45 days after the initial dose. In contrast, continuous dosing
of NVP-LDE225 (at varying drug concentrations and dosing
schedules) resulted in resistant tumors after only 13 days of
treatment. It is surprising that drugs of apparently similar
potency should promote the emergence of resistance at such
different frequencies in models that were developed on the
same Ptchþ/p53/ platform, and this finding suggests that
subtle differences in genetic background or drug behavior may
have an impact on the initiation of resistance to SMO inhibitors.
As the molecule driving resistance in the medulloblastoma
patient, Smo was sequenced in all drug-resistant tumor
lines. Particularly striking was the discovery of a heterozygous
A-to-G missense mutation at position 1944 in one of the
vismodegib-resistant lines (13). This single nucleotide switch
results in an Asp-to-Gly change at residue 477 (D477G), which
corresponds exactly to the human D473 residue mutated in
the medulloblastoma patient. Moreover, an in vitro analysis of
SMO showed that substitution of D473 with any other amino
acid allowed SMO to retain functionality (apart from the
possibly misfolded D473P mutation) but reduced sensitivity
to vismodegib, which correlated to a reduction in drug-target
binding (16). These data show that, although SMO-D473 is not
essential for SMO activity, it is critical for vismodegib binding
(16). Of the 135 NVP-LDE225-resistant lines generated, 7
contained missense mutations in Smo, representing substitutions at 5 different residues (19), none of which was D477 (the
mouse equivalent of human D473). However, SMO-D473H
significantly impairs the ability of NVP-LDE225 to inhibit
Hh signaling in vitro (G. Dijkgraaf, unpublished data). It thus
appears that mutations at multiple sites in SMO can confer
resistance to SMO antagonists. The question remains as to

whether any of these residues participate directly in drug
binding, or if mutation at these sites induces a conformational
change that indirectly affects drug binding.
Upregulation of Gli2, a downstream effector of the Hh
pathway, was identified as an important alternative mechanism that confers resistance against SMO antagonists. Amplifications of chromosomal regions containing Gli2 were
discovered in a model of vismodegib resistance (16) and in
2 of 3 NVP-LDE225-resistant lines analyzed by comparative
genomic hybridization (19). Knockdown of Gli2 in cells isolated from Gli2-amplified NVP-LDE225-resistant tumors
resulted in partial reconstitution of sensitivity to the inhibitor
(19). The high frequency of Gli2 amplification in NVP-LDE225resistant tumors (50% of Ptchþ/p53/ tumors analyzed by
quantitative real-time PCR) may also explain, at least in part,
the observed high penetrance of Hh pathway reactivation in
resistant tumors. The reactivation of the Hh pathway downstream of PTCH1 and SMO is in keeping with the notion of
oncogenic addiction, i.e., in this case, the Hh pathway is
critical for the oncogenic pathology of medulloblastoma.
Indeed, an additional vismodegib-resistant line displayed an
amplification of the Hh target gene, ccnd1, which was previously identified as a key element in the pathogenesis of
medulloblastoma in Ptchþ/ mice (16, 20).

The PI3K Pathway Is Implicated in the
Pathogenesis and Resistance of Hh-Driven
Medulloblastoma in Mouse Models
Surprisingly, IGF1R-PI3K target genes were much enriched
in NVP-LDE225–resistant samples when compared with drugsensitive samples, suggesting that a compensatory upregulation of this pathway may contribute to the development of
resistance (19). This mechanism was observed in the case of
erlotinib/gefitinib resistance (14). In addition, a combination of
NVP-LDE225 and the PI3K class 1 inhibitor NVP-BKM120,
when coadministered from the time of initial treatment,
appeared to delay the onset of resistance and subsequent
tumor regrowth (17). Of importance, though, the treatment
of established NVP-LDE225–resistant tumors with NVPBKM120 did not have a significant impact on tumor regrowth.
It may be that PI3K pathway activation in NVP-LDE225–
resistant tumors is driven downstream of PI3K itself, explaining the lack of efficacy of the PI3K inhibitor in established NVPLDE225–resistant tumors. Although PI3K target genes were
enriched in a number of resistant versus sensitive tumors in the

NVP-LDE225 study (19), no such enrichment was seen in the
vismodegib study (16). It is possible that the small number of
vismodegib-resistant models analyzed was simply insufficient
to uncover PI3K pathway upregulation as a potential mechanism of resistance. Although NVP-BKM120 administered as a
single agent failed to affect tumor development (16), treatment
of both vismodegib-sensitive and vismodegib-resistant tumors
with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 significantly delayed tumor
growth (14). This finding, together with the delayed onset of
resistance in the presence of combined NVP-LDE225 and NVPBKM120, strongly argues that targeting the PI3K pathway in
Hh-dependent tumors is an avenue well worth pursuing.

Conclusions
The dramatic clinical response of a medulloblastoma
patient to vismodegib emphasizes the great therapeutic
potential of targeting the Hh pathway in specific cancers.
However, the rapid reemergence of disease in that patient
indicates that, like other targeted therapies, acquired resistance to Hh pathway inhibitors is a potential hurdle to durable
response in the clinic. In the context of resistance to kinase
inhibitors, elucidation of mechanisms of resistance has contributed to the clinical success of second-generation inhibitors. Understanding how resistance against SMO inhibitors
might occur in the clinic is thus a top priority. In this regard,
patient samples will clearly be extremely valuable; however,
the striking recapitulation of the patient-derived D473H mutation in the vismodegib-resistant mouse model highlights the
value of exploring mechanisms of drug resistance in other
systems. The studies described here provide an impetus for
continuing research into 2 distinct approaches to circumvent
resistance against SMO antagonists, both in medulloblastoma
and in other settings: second-generation inhibitors and targeting of the PI3K pathway. Although the emergence of resistance
to a SMO antagonist has only been documented in a single
case of medulloblastoma, the potential emergence of resistance should be carefully monitored in the ongoing clinical
trials of Hh pathway inhibitors in basal cell carcinoma and
other cancers.
