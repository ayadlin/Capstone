ABSTRACT
There is increasing evidence to suggest that hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs)
are sustained by a distinct subpopulation of self-renewing cells known as cancer
stem cells. However, the precise signals required for maintenance of stemness-like
properties of these cells are yet to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that the
level of oncoprotein osteopontin (OPN) in tumor cells of the edge of bulk tumors was
significantly correlated with the clinical prognosis of patients with HCC. OPN was
highly expressed in side population fractions of HCC cell lines, as well as in dormant
cells, spheroids and chemo-resistant cancer cells, all of which are considered as
having stemness-like cellular features. Depletion of OPN in HCC cell lines resulted
in a reduction in the proportion of side population fractions, formation of hepatospheroids, expression of stem-cell-associated genes and decreased tumorigenecity
in immunodeficient mice. Mechanistically, OPN was demonstrated to bind to integrin
αvβ3 and activate the transcription factor NF-κB, which resulted in upregulation of
HIF-1α transcription and its downstream gene, BMI1, to mediate maintenance of the
stemness-like phenotype. Suppression of the αvβ3–NF-κB–HIF-1α pathway decreased
OPN-mediated self-renewal capabilities. Levels of OPN protein expression were
significantly correlated with HIF-1α protein levels in HCC tumor tissue samples.
OPN might promote a cancer stem cell-like phenotype via the αvβ3–NF-κB–HIF-1α
pathway. Our findings offer strong support for OPN requirement in maintaining stemlike properties in HCC cells.

[1, 2]. Despite major advances in the development of
treatment approaches for the disease, improvements in
disease-free survival and long-term prognosis for patients
with HCC remain unsatisfactory [3, 4].
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subset of tumor
cells with the capability to self-renew and differentiate

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most
prevalent cancer worldwide and as such presents a major
global health burden. The current definitive treatment for
HCC is surgical resection combined with chemotherapy

OPN expression is correlated with
side-population fraction

into a diverse range of cell types that contribute to tumor
growth and recurrence, as well as conferring resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents [5]. CSCs were first identified
in leukemias and have since been found in range of solid
tumors, including breast, brain, prostate, melanoma and
colon cancers [5]. In the hematopoietic compartment, a
side population of stem cells that express the receptor
tyrosine kinase, Tie2, are quiescent and antiapoptotic [6].
Similar to this side population of hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs), CSCs are also quiescent, which may account for
these cells being able to evade the effects of chemotherapy
and radiation treatments [7, 8].
In the case of HCC, research directed towards
understanding the role of CSCs has attracted a large
amount of attention. A number of studies that have
characterized CSCs in HCC have focused on cells that
express surface markers, such as CD133, CD44, CD90,
EpCAM, CD24 and CD13 [8–13]. Moreover, a side
population of cells that are antipoptotic, express ‘stemness
genes’ and exhibit pluripotent potential have been
identified in HCC tissues and might function as CSCs [14].
The function of oncogenes in CSCs and the pathways
that regulate self-renewal and tumorigenesis in HCC are
unclear; and development of targeted therapies aimed at
oncogenes or pathways that are pathogenic in both primary
and metastatic HCC continues to pose a challenge. The
oncoprotein osteopontin (OPN) is a chemokine-like,
extracellular matrix protein that binds to integrins and
to members of the CD44 receptor family on which is
expressed on multiple HCC cell types [15–17]. Upon
binding, various kinases, including PI3K, and MAP3K14,
and several transcription factors such as nuclear factorkappa B (NF-kB), AP-1 and Ets-1 are activated leading
to OPN-induced tumor growth, angiogenesis, tumor
metastasis and inhibition of apoptosis [18–21].
Previously, we have demonstrated that OPN
functions in HCC to promote tumor growth and metastasis
through induction of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
[17]. OPN is expressed in the hematopoietic stem cell
compartment where it is involved in negative regulation
of HSC proliferation [22, 23]. In glioma, OPN and CD44
share a similar perivascular expression profile, and OPN
was found to promote development of glioma stem celllike phenotypes through its action as a CD44 ligand [24].
However, little is known regarding the function of OPN in
CSCs in the context of HCC.
Here, we sought to explore the function of OPN in
HCC-associated CSCs and to determine the mechanism
by which OPN might contribute to tumor progression and
survival in HCC. Our findings suggest that overexpression
of OPN promotes development of cells with stemnesslike characteristics in HCC, via modulation of the integrin
αvβ3–NF-kB–hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α)
signaling axis. These data identify a novel role for OPN as
an effector that mediates development of progenitor cells
in the liver and of CSCs that drive progression of HCC.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A side-population fraction of cells with a high selfrenewal and tumorigenic properties has been identified
in several cancer types [6, 14, 25]. Although some
controversy exists regarding the function of these cells,
one hypothesis is that cells in the side-population could
be CSCs [26]. Supporting this hypothesis, cells that
were isolated from side-populations of HCC cell lines
demonstrated CSC-like properties, such as increased
chemo-resistance, and were associated with enhanced
tumorgenicity in vivo [27].
Side-population fractions of six HCC cell lines,
including HCCLM3, HCC97H, HCC97L, Hep3B, PLC/
PRF/5 and HuH7 were analyzed (Figure 1A). In metastatic
HCC lines (HCCLM3, HCC97H and HCC97L), the sidepopulation fractions ranged from 23.7% to 7.86%. By
comparison, proportion of side-population cells in nonmetastatic HCC lines (Hep3B, PLC/PRF/5 and HuH7)
were markedly lower and ranged from 1.53% to 0.5%. We
then assessed the relationship between side-population
fractions and levels of secreted OPN in HCC cell lines.
Consistent with a role for OPN in driving metastasis,
levels of secreted OPN were much higher in metastatic
cell lines with high side-population fractions than those
in the non-metastatic cell lines with low side-population
fractions (Figure 1B). The self-renewal capacity of cells in
the side and main populations of HCCLM3 cells was also
examined. In both sphere-forming and colony-forming
assays, cells in the side population fraction formed
great numbers of both spheres and colonies than cells in
the main population. This finding indicates that cells in
the side population have greater self-renewal capacity
than those in the main population of the HCCLM3 cell
line (Supplementary Figures S1A and S1B). To further
delineate the association of OPN production and cells in
the side-population fraction, we sorted the side-population
and main-population from HCCLM3 cells and assessed
levels of OPN protein expression. Western blot revealed
a great increase of OPN protein levels in side-population
cells compared with main-population cells (Figure 1C).
This finding was supported by semi-quantitative immuno­
fluorescence analysis, which suggested that more OPN
protein was present in side-population cells versus mainpopulation cells (Figure 1D).

OPN expression in tumor cells of the edge of
bulk tumors is associated with increased tumor
aggression and decreased survival in patients
with HCC
We examined the expression of OPN protein
in tissue samples resected from patients with HCC.
In non-tumor tissues OPN was weakly expressed in
cholangiocytes but in no other cells types, however, by

contrast, OPN was highly expressed in bulk tumor tissues
(Figure 2A). Furthermore, three distinct patterns of
OPN expression were observed in HCC tumor sections:
type 1 revealed OPN expression in less than 10% tumor
cells and was distributed across the bulk of the tumor; type
2 expression was characterized by localization to tumor
cells at the edge of bulk tumor cells, which is the region
that invades the capsule; the type 3 pattern was marked
by constitutive OPN expression in almost all tumor
cells. These patterns revealed that OPN expression is
heterogeneous across human HCC tumor specimens.
We then sought to determine the association, if any,
between the classifications of OPN expression and the
clinical presentation of patients with HCC (Supplementary
Table S1). No significant associations were found for any
of the patterns of OPN expression with gender, hepatitis
B surface antigen (HbsAg), serum AFP level and cirrhosis
(Table 1). However, only the type 2 OPN expression
pattern was found to be significantly associated with the
stage of HCC when compared to OPN-negative tumors
(P = 0.022). Notably, patients with type 2 OPN expression
experienced significantly higher recurrence rates following
surgical resection than patients with negative OPN
expression (P = 0.010).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients
with type 2 OPN expression patterns had significantly
lower rates of disease-free survival and overall survival
when compared to patients with tumors that were negative
for OPN expression (P = 0.010 and P = 0.010, respectively;
Figure 2B and Table 1). Together, these results suggest
the expression of OPN in tumor cells of the edge of bulk
tumors is associated with increased tumor aggression and
decreased survival in patients with HCC.

OPN is highly expressed in HCC cells with
stem-like properties
Given that side-population HCC cells have striking
similarities to stem cells and are a relatively dormant,
we investigated whether OPN was also highly expressed
in this population. Cells that retained the PKH26
label, which is indicative of the cells being dormant,
in both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated
high expression of OPN (Figures 3A; Supplementary
Figure S2). Furthermore, dormant cells demonstrated
significantly higher expression of stem-cell-associated
genes, including OCT4, BMI1, HIF-1α and the gene that
encodes the drug resistant transporter ABCG2, compared

to cells that did not retain the PHK26 label (Figure 3B).
Strikingly, expression of OPN from PKH high positive
cells was five-fold increase compared to that of cells from
unsorted fractions and 13.9-fold greater than cells in the
PKH negative fractions (Figure 3B). Further analysis
of expression of OPN in quiescent cells was conducted
using HCCLM3 cells that were xeno-transplanted into
nude mice and the developing tumors labeled with BrdU.
After six weeks of tumor growth, BrdU-label-retaining
cells were typically observed at the edge of tumor foci
and these cells were also found co-localized with staining
for OPN (Figure 3C).
Spheres contain stem/progenitor cells, and the number
of spheres formed upon serial passage under defined culture
conditions is considered a reflection of the self-renewal
capacity of stem/progenitor cells [28]. In HCCLM3 cells,
accompanied with the up-regulation of several stem-cellassociated genes, including OCT4, SOX2, BMI1, HIF1α and ABCG2, the expression of OPN was increased
in serial spheres compared to adherent cells by a factor
of approximately 4–4.5-fold (Figure  3D). Similar to the
reported levels of mRNA transcripts, levels of OPN protein
were also increased in spheres compared to adherent cells
(Supplementary Figure S3A). Furthermore, Hep3B spheres
were co-stained of OPN with other markers associated with
hepatic stem cells or stem cells. The majority of cells in the
Hep3B spheres expressed high levels of OPN protein, which
were co-localized with several known hepatic stem cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

markers, such as AFP, EpCAM and CK19, and the stemcell-associated marker OCT4 (Figure 3E).
Given the hypothesis that CSCs are resistant to
chemotherapeutic agents, we sought to investigate the
expression of OPN in chemo-resistant HCC cells. In
cultured HCC97L or Hep3B cells OPN protein levels
were up-regulated following 72 hrs of exposure to either
cisplatin (PT) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Supplementary
Figure S3B). A xenograft model was established to
generate and enrich for CSCs with increased chemoresistance. The chemo-resistant tumors expressed high
levels of stemness-associated genes, including OCT4,
BMI1 and NOTCH1, as well as chemo-resistant-related
genes, such as HIF-1α (Figure 3F). Importantly, OPN
mRNA levels were increased in the chemo-resistant tumors
(Figure 3F). We also examined the expression of OPN in
tumors by IHC and confirmed that OPN expression in
chemo-resistant tumors was significantly up-regulated
relative to control tumors (Supplementary Figure S3C).
Together, these data demonstrate that OPN is highly
expressed in HCC cells with stem-like properties.

OPN is critical to maintaining the CSC-like
phenotype

various CSC properties, such as localization to a sidepopulation fraction, dormancy, sphere formation and

The knockdown efficiency of two shRNA constructs

construct that target site 2 was chosen for further study
(Supplementary Figures S4A). The effect of knockingdown OPN expression on self-renewal was assessed by

formation assays. HCC cells in which OPN expression
was knocked-down exhibited a dramatically decreased
ability to form colonies (Figure 4A and Supplementary

in generation of fewer and smaller spheres in each serial
passage compared to control groups (Figure 4A). Analysis
of side populations in OPN depleted HCCLM3 and
Hep3B cells demonstrated reductions of 52% and 70% in
proportions, respectively (Figure 4B).
HCC cells with self-renewal potential can
differentiate to cells with different lineage-specific
markers. We, therefore, assayed lineage markers at the
single cell level in a mixture colony assay. Three types
of colonies arose from the HCCLM3 cells: mixture
colony, consisting of AFP+CK19+ and AFP+CK19- cells;
and two homogenous types of colonies, consisting of

either AFP+CK19− or AFP−CK19− cells. Unlike the
homogenous colonies, the mixed phenotype colony
demonstrated that cells that form this type of colony are
stem/progenitor cells with potential for bi-directional
differentiation. Unlike the HCCLM3 cells, four types
colonies arose from the Hep3B cells: mixed colony
that consisted of the four cell types AFP+CK19+,
AFP+CK19−, AFP-CK19+ and AFP−CK19− cells; and
each of the other three homogenous colonies, consisting
of either AFP+CK19−, AFP-CK19+ or AFP-CK19− cells.
In the HCCLM3 control cells, the proportion of mixed
colonies formed that represent a self-renewal ability
was 24%, which was much higher than the 7.5% of the
OPN-knockdown cells (Figure 4C). Likely, in Hep3B,
the mixture colony containing all phenotypes was 23.4%
in control group versus 12.7% in OPN knockdown
group (Figure 4C). Representative images of the mixed
colonies are shown in Supplementary Figure S4D. The
finding that OPN-depleting diminished ability of HCC
cells to form stem/progenitor cells suggests that OPN is
a critical determinant in CSC-development in HCC.
We also investigated the effects of OPN-depletion
on chemo-resistance in HCC cells. Compared with control
cells, OPN-knockdown cells displayed significantly higher
sensitivities to the two tested chemotherapeutic agents
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(P < 0.01; Figure 4D). In addition, we compared the
expression of stemness-associated genes between OPNknockdown cells and controls. The results showed that
OPN-knockdown resulted in downregulation of HIF-1α,
OCT4, NANOG, CK19, BMI1, and NOTCH1 (Figure 4E).
Investigation of the role of OPN in tumorigenesis
demonstrated that while control cells readily formed
tumors within five weeks, the same number of OPNknockdown cells failed to form palpable tumors within 11
weeks (Supplementary Figure S4E). Consistent with these
findings, when cells were implanted into the flanks of
SCID mice, control cells produced large tumors in 100%
of mice; whereas only 25% mice that were injected with
OPN-knockdown cells developed tumors at 12 weeks after
transplantation (Figure 4F). Thus down-regulation of OPN
attenuated the self-renewal capabilities of HCC cells in
vitro, as well as limiting expression of stemness-associated
genes and in vivo tumor formation.

Secreted HCC-derived OPN maintains cancer
cell stemness
It has been reported that plasma levels of OPN is
significantly elevated in patients with HCC compared to
healthy control individuals. Furthermore, the concentration
6632

Oncotarget

of serum OPN is markedly increased with larger tumor
burdens in patients with cancer [29]. We hypothesized that
secreted OPN might have an important role in maintaining
the stemness-like characteristics of HCC cells.
The effects of blocking OPN signaling on the selfrenewal capacity of HCC cells were investigated. Addition
of anti-OPN antibodies to HCCLM3 cells inhibited sphere
formation (Figure 5A). Supplementation of different
concentrations (10 μg/mL, 20 μg/mL and 40 μg/mL) of
anti-OPN antibody to the media of cultured HCCLM3
cells resulted in reductions of the proportions of side
population fractions from 18.8% to 8.72% (Figure 5B).
The effects of secreted OPN on self-renewal were
further investigated by depleting extracellular OPN from
conditioned media by immunoprecipitation. As shown in
Figure 5C, OPN expression in OPN-depleted HCCLM3
conditioned media was substantially decreased compared
with complete HCCLM3 conditioned media. The
HL7702 cell line, which is an immortal human liver cell
line, readily formed spheres when cultured with control
HCCLM3 conditioned media. However, fewer spheres
were observed in when HL7702 cells were cultured in the
presence of OPN-depleted conditioned media (Figure 5C).
Since inflammatory cells in the tumor
microenvironment also express OPN, we assessed the
effects of secreted OPN derived from inflammatory cells
on self-renewal. First, we activated THP-1 (a human

monocytic cell line) cells by treatment with PMA in
serum-free culture media and collected the conditioned
media after 24 hrs. Extracellular OPN was depleted
from the conditioned media as described above. Spheres
formation of HL7702 cells in conditioned media was
unaffected by the depletion of OPN, which suggested that
OPN derived from inflammatory cells has limited impact
on tumor stemness (Figure 5D).

OPN supports cellular self-renewal
via HIF-1α and BMI1
To determine the major downstream mediators of
OPN signaling in tumor initiation and self-renewal, we
assessed the expression of stemness-associated genes
in both HCCLM3 and Hep3B cell lines expressing
OPN-targeting siRNA-LV constructs. Expression of
both HIF1α and BMI1 was consistently downregulated
or upregulated in response to loss of OPN expression
or overexpression of OPN, respectively (Figures 4E
and 6A). We then examined the correlation between OPN
and HIF-1α expression by IHC in tumor tissue samples
from patients with HCC. Representative images of
negative (case 25), type 2 (case 12) and type 3 (case 7)
OPN expression patterns with corresponding HIF-1α
expression are shown (Figure 6B). In the OPN-negative
group, HIF-1α co-expression was found in 13 of 54

(24.1%) patient samples. However, in patients with type
2 and 3 OPN expression patterns, HIF-1α coexpression
was found in 12 of 17 (70.6%) and 15 of 28 (53.6%)
patient samples, respectively (Figure 6C). The correlation
between OPN and HIF-1α expression was significant for
patients with type 2 expression versus OPN-negative
patients (P = 0.000, r = 0.416) and for patients with
type 3 expression patterns versus OPN-negative patients
(P = 0.007, r = 0.295) (Figure 6C).
To determine if OPN maintains tumor stemness and
self-renewal characteristics by activating HIF-1α gene
expression, we overexpressed HIF-1α in OPN-depleted
HCCLM3 cells. HIF-1α overexpression resulted in an
increase in the number of spheres formed and in the side
population fraction, which was reduced in the absence of
OPN expression (Figures 6D and 6F and Supplementary
Figure S5A). Similarly, HIF-1α expression rescued the cell
survival phenotype in response to treatment with PT or
5-FU (Supplementary Figure S5C).
An HIF-1α siRNA knockdown strategy was
implemented to further elucidate the role of this protein
in maintaining stemness characteristics. BMI1 expression
was significantly down-regulated when HIF-1α expression
was silenced, which is consistent with a report that
BMI1 is activated under hypoxic conditions or by HIF1α overexpression [30] (Supplementary Figure S5B).
Sphere formation in cells deficient for HIF-1α was also
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

decreased significantly compared to controls in HCC97L
cells that overexpressed OPN (Figure 6E). Since BMI1
overexpression was observed in tumor-initiating cells and
levels of BMI1 mRNA were downregulated in response to
OPN knockdown, we asked if BMI1 functioned downstream
of OPN to mediate stemness in HCC cells. Overexpression
of BMI1 in OPN-deficient cells reversed the negative effects
of OPN depletion on sphere formation (Supplementary
Figures S6A and S6B). Consistent with these findings,
knock down of BMI1 protein levels resulted in a reduction
of sphere formation in HCC97L cells that overexpressed
OPN (Supplementary Figures S6C and S6D). These data
indicate that HIF-1α and BMI1 function downstream of
OPN to mediate stemness of HCC cells in vitro.

The integrin αvβ3–NF-κB–HIF1α axis mediates
OPN-induced stemness
We sought to determine the transcription factor
that regulates HIF-1α expression in the context of
OPN signaling. NF-kB is a transcription factor that
has previously been reported to bind to the HIF-1α
promoter under conditions of reactive oxygen species
stimulation  [31]. Given that NF-kB is activated upon
OPN-mediated apoptosis, we were interested to determine
if NF-kB also mediates OPN-induced stemness in HCC
cells [17].

(F) Quantification of side population fractions from HCCLM3 LV-shNon or LV-shOPN infected with LV-HIF-1α or control lentivirus.

These data support a mechanism for OPN regulation
that functions through OPN binding to integrin αvβ3, and
initiating a signaling cascade that results in upregulation
of HIF-1α expression via activation of NF-kB.

In HCC97L cells that overexpressed OPN, NF-kB
activity was increased, as was activation of the HIF-1α
promoter (Figure 7A). Addition of PDTC, which is an NFkB inhibitor, resulted in a sharp decrease in NF-kB activity
in LV-OPN cells as well as a reduction in activation of the
HIF-1α promoter. Together, these results indicate that OPNinduced HIF-1α expression is regulated by NF-kB (Figure
7A). We next sought to determine if NF-kB to binding to
the HIF-1α promoter was regulated by OPN. ChIP analysis
demonstrated that p65 binding to the HIF-1α promoter was
reduced in OPN-deficient cells compared to control cells.
Conversely, in cells that overexpress OPN, increased binding
of p65 to the HIF-1α promoter was observed (Figure 7B).
We were also interested in determining the factors
upstream of this signaling cascade and the receptor to
which OPN binds to mediate stemness. We blocked OPN
binding with anti-integrin αvβ3 and anti-CD44 antibodies
and assessed the effects of blockade on activity of NFkB and at the HIF-1α promoter. As shown in Figure 7C,
blockage of integrin αvβ3 but not of CD44 reversed the
effects of OPN overexpression on both activity of NF-kB
and activity at the HIF-1α promoter. Consistent with these
findings, HIF-1α mRNA levels were decreased in cells
treated with antibodies directed against OPN and integrin
αvβ3 cells, but not against CD44 (Figure 7D). Moreover,
similar to OPN blockade, administration of an anti-αvβ3
antibody inhibited the sphere formation (Figure  7E).

DISCUSSION
HCC is one of the most prevalent and lethal cancers
worldwide [32]. Metastasis, tumor recurrence and chemoresistance are among the leading causes of mortality of
patients with HCC. Ten years ago the hypothesis of CSCs
being a major contributor to tumor reoccurrence was
developed and provided new targets for development of
anti-tumor therapies. However, the key molecular and
signaling pathways that are involved in maintaining the
stemness properties of CSCs are still poorly understood.
Here we demonstrate that the oncoprotein OPN
has a critical function in stemness-maintenance of HCC
cell lines. We show that expression of OPN protein is
upregulated in metastatic HCC cell lines and in primary
HCC tumor tissues. Moreover, we report that high OPN
expression in HCC tumor tissues is significantly associated
with expression of HIF-1α and that OPN binds to integrin
αvβ3 and initiates a signaling cascade that results in
upregulation of HIF-1α expression via activation of the
transcription factor NF-kB, resulting in an increase of
tumorigenic capacity of HCC cells.

We propose that OPN is an important oncogene
because it is frequently overexpressed in HCC and
other types of cancer where it functions to modulate the
metastatic potential of various tumors. We have previously
shown that OPN inhibits apoptosis of tumor cells via a
drug-induced activation of NF-kB thereby facilitating
tumorigenesis and metastasis [17]. Importantly, in liver
stem/progenitor cell field, OPN has been overlooked as
a marker in various rodent models of oval cell induction
[33, 34]. Consistent with these findings, in this study we
report that OPN is highly expressed in HCC CSCs and
functions to promote expression stemness-like factors and
tumorigenic properties of HCC. In spheroids, OPN was
found coexpressed with hepatocytic and cholangiocytic
markers and depletion of OPN resulted in reduced
potential to form mixed colonies. Conversely, cells that
express high levels of OPN retained the potential for
bidirectional differentiation, similar to the pluripotency
of stem cells. In our experiments, invasive cells that
express high levels of OPN in tumor capsule are positive

correlation with patient prognosis feature. Several
researches believe OPN originated from inflammatory
cells such as macrophage of tumor microenvironment
contribute to tumor carcinogenesis and progression
[35, 36]. However in our observations, tumor cells
which invade in tumor capsule highly expressed OPN
(Figure 2A).
According to the traditional definition of CSCs,
tumor initiation is a characteristic feature of CSCs
[37]. Quiescent CSCs have been proposed to play
an important role in tumor growth, recurrence and
metastasis. For example, in melanoma, a temporarily
distinct subpopulation of slow-cycling cells is required
for continuous tumor growth [38]. However, an alternative
hypothesis is that proliferating CSCs-like cells (also called
stemloids) instead of quiescent stem cells, determine
tumor progression, prognosis, therapeutic failures, and
resistance to therapy [39, 40]. Here, the observed high
expression of OPN in PKH-high and BrdU-label-retaining
quiescent cells, as well as in spherical self-renewing cells
6636

suggests that OPN maintains the CSCs-like phenotype in
quiescent stem cells and proliferating CSCs.
Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcript
factors that mediate cellular responses to hypoxia. Several
reports have shown that HIFs can promote stem-cell-like
phenotypes in normal tissues. Since the emergence of the
CSC hypothesis, the function of HIFs in these cells has
been investigated extensively. HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α,
is induced under hypoxic conditions and upregulation of
this factor is critical to maintaining the tumorigenicity of
glioma stem cells [41]. Coexpression of the Wnt receptorFrizzled receptor 6, with HIF1/2α in hypoxic areas of
primary human neuroblastomas tumors is characteristic
of a population of rare, highly tumorigenic stem-like
cells [42]. Interaction of HIF-1α and Notch3, which is
required for the expression of the hypoxia-responsive
gene Carbonic Anhydrase 9, is a potential target for
cancer/stem cell therapy [43]. The HIF1α-Notch pathway
is proposed to be essential for maintenance of CSCs in
hematological malignancies under conditions of normoxia
[44]. It has also been suggested that OPN enhances CSClike phenotypes and promotes aggressive growth of
glioma tumors through activation of HIF-2α, which occurs
downstream of OPN binding to CD44 [24]. A recent study
also demonstrated hypoxia-induced expression of OPN in
breast cancer cells. OPN-induced activation of integrinlinked kinase (ILK)/Akt-mediated NF-kB p65 leads to
HIF1α-dependent vascular endothelial growth factor
expression and angiogenesis in response to hypoxia [45].
Here our data show that OPN contributes to
maintaining HCC stemness via the NF-kB–HIF-1α–BMI1
pathway. OPN expression was significantly associated with
levels of HIF-1α in HCC patient samples, which strongly
suggests that stemness of HCC cells that is regulated
by OPN is intrinsically linked to activation of HIF-1α.
BMI1 is an indirect downstream effector of HIF-1α
activation and is important to maintenance of stemnesslike phenotypes, such as regulation of development
of CSCs. There is a large body of evidence to suggest
that NF-kB pathway contributes to the development of
several types of human cancer including HCC. We and
others have previously reported that OPN depletion
results in suppression of NF-kB activity. In this work, we
have confirmed that OPN regulates NF-kB activity and
modulates HIF-1α expression through interactions with
integrin αvβ3. These findings are supported by evidence
in other cancer types, such as a reported role for NF-kB in
CSC expansion in breast cancer [46].
In this article we have demonstrated that OPN
maintains CSC-like features via an integrin signaling
pathway. CD44 signaling enhances CSC-like phenotypes
in glioma [24], however, in our experiments, this pathway
does not mediate OPN-HIF-1α-driven self-renewal of
HCC cells (Figure 7C, 7D) and further research of the role
of CD44 signaling in self-renewal of OPN is warranted.
Here, we focused on discerning the function of secreted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

OPN, however, is it also possible that intracellular OPN
contribute toward development and maintenance of CSCs
in HCC via mechanisms that are distinct from signaling
pathway characterized in the current study.
Our study highlights the role of OPN in maintaining
self-renewal and chemo-resistance properties of HCC
cells and identifies the OPN–NF-kB–HIF-1α pathway as
a potential target for regulating the stemness properties of
HCC cells. We also provide evidence that supports using
levels of circulating OPN as a novel prognostic marker of
HCC possibly in conjunction with other markers of CSCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sphere formation assay and anchorageindependent growth assays
Cells were suspended at a concentration of 1000
cells/mL in serum free medium DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 4 μg/mL insulin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), 20 ng/mL epidermal
growth factor (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), 20 ng/mL
basic fibroblast growth factor (PeproTech), B27 (1:50;
Invitrogen) and 0.4% bovine serum albumin. Cells were
plated onto ultralow attachment plates (Corning, Corning,
NY, USA). For serial passages of spheres, every 7–12 days
spheres were collected, dissociated with trypsin into a
single-cell suspension and cultured under conditions as
described above. For anchorage-independent growth
assays, cells were seeded onto a 24-well plate (500 cells/
well) in 0.3% agarose over a 0.6% agarose bottom layer.
After three weeks, the numbers of colonies greater than
100 μm in diameter were counted.

Side population assays
For side population analysis, cells were detached
from the dishes with trypsin and suspended in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum at the density of 1×106 cells/mL. The cells
were then incubated at 37°C for 90 min with 20 μg/
mL Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich), either alone or in
the presence of 50 μmol/L verapamil (Sigma-Aldrich).
Cells were washed, centrifuged and resuspended in icecold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then, 1 μg/mL
propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and the
cells were filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) to obtain a singlesuspension of cells.

Cell-fate tracing
Cells were labeled with 50 μM PKH26GL (SigmaAldrich) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For in
vitro assays, 3×104 labeled HCCLM3 cells were seeded
into 24-well plates and immunostaining for OPN was

performed after 144 hrs in culture. For in vivo assays,
5×105 labeled HCCLM3 cells were subcutaneously
injected into nude mice. Six weeks later, the tumors
were minced and digested with type IV collagenase
(Sigma-Aldrich). Single-cell suspensions were obtained
by filtration through a 70 μm filter (BD Biosciences)
and immunostaining of OPN was performed. For BrdUretaining assays, six weeks after intraperitoneal injections
with BrdU (10 mg per kg body weight) three times a day
for 2 days, the HCCLM3 cells-xenografted nude mice
were sacrificed and tumors minced into sections and
embedded in paraffin. BrdU-retaining cells were assayed
by immunohistochemistry using anti-BrdU antibody
(Invitrogen) and goat anti-OPN antibody (R&D Systems).
Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor
488 and anti-goat IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen).

binding site (−197/188 bp) for 35 cycles with an annealing
temperature of at 55°C. We analyzed the amplification
products by electrophoresis with 2% agarose gels.

Animal xenograft tumor
Six-week-old SCID mice were purchased from
the Shanghai Experimental Center (CSA, Shanghai, PR
China). All mice were housed in a facility with a 12 h
light/dark cycle and allowed free access to food and water.
Animal care and surgical procedures were approved by
the Second Military Medical University Medical Center
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, as set
forth in the ‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals’ published by the National Institutes of Health.
For the establishment of xenograft tumors, HCCLM3
cells were suspended at a 1:1 ratio in 200 μL of complete
medium and Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and delivered
via subcutaneous injections. The size and incidence of
subcutaneous tumors were measured and recorded on a
weekly basis.

Cell viability and chemo-resistance assays
Cells infected with LV-shOPN and LV-shNon
were detached, counted and seeded into 96-well plates
(5,000 cells/well). After 24 hrs, either 5-FU or PT was
added into the medium and incubated for 72 hrs. The
media containing either 5-FU or PT was then removed
and the cells washed twice with PBS. Cell viability was
determined by MTS assay reagent (CellTiter 96 AQueous
One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The chemo-resistance model was established by
intravenously injecting HCCLM3 xenografted-nude mice
with PT (once per week for 3 weeks) and resecting the
tumors after 3 weeks of treatment. Cells from the resected
tumors were then subcutaneously inoculated into PTtreated naïve nude mice, which gave rise to “2o chemoresistant tumors” after 3 weeks. Generation of 3o and 4o
chemo-resistant tumors was achieved through the same
serial transfer procedure.

Clinical specimens
One-hundred-and-twenty-five HCC tumor tissue
samples were obtained from the Eastern Hepatobiliary
Surgical Hospital (Shanghai, PR China) and Guangxi Cancer
Hospital (Nanning, PR China) with informed consent.

Statistical analysis
The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed
to compare patient survival data. The Student’s t-test was
used to compare data between two groups. The Spearman’s
rank correlation coefficient and chi-square tests were used
to analysis the correlation between the levels of OPN and
HIF-1α in HCC patient tumor samples. Differences were
considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.

Mixture colony assay
