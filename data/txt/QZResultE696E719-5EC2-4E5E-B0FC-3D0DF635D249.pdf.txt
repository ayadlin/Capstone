ABSTRACT
The PAX5 gene is altered in 30% of BCP-ALL patients and PAX5 chromosomal
translocations account for 2–3% of cases. Although PAX5 fusion genes significantly
affect the transcription of PAX5 target genes, their role in sustaining leukemia cell
survival is poorly understood.
In an in vitro model of PAX5/ETV6 leukemia, we demonstrated that Lck hyperactivation, and down-regulation of its negative regulator Csk, lead to STAT5 hyperactivation and consequently to the up-regulation of the downstream effectors, cMyc and
Ccnd2. More important, cells from PAX5 translocated patients show LCK up-regulation
and over-activation, as well as STAT5 hyper-phosphorylation, compared to PAX5 wt
and PAX5 deleted cases. As in BCR/ABL1 positive ALL, the hyper-activation of STAT5
pathway can represent a survival signal in PAX5 translocated cells, alternative to the
pre-BCR, which is down-regulated. The LCK inhibitor BIBF1120 selectively reverts this
phenomenon both in the murine model and in leukemic primary cells. LCK inhibitor could
therefore represent a suitable candidate drug to target this subgroup of ALL patients.

and it encodes for the PAX5/ETV6 fusion gene, [2, 5–8]
which results in the juxtaposition of two transcription
factors, fundamental in hematopoiesis and in B cell
development [9]. The PAX5/ETV6 fusion protein retains
the DNA binding domain of PAX5, while it substitutes its
regulatory domains with the DNA binding, dimerization
and transcription regulation domains of ETV6 [7].
We previously reported that PAX5/ETV6 is an
aberrant transcription factor that localizes in the nucleus, [10]
and alters the transcription profile of pre-BI cells, mainly
deregulating genes involved in pre-BCR assembly and
signaling [11]. Moreover, among the differentially expressed
genes, a significant number has been described to be
transcriptional direct targets of Pax5. One of the top-ranking
up-regulated genes was the Src kinase Lck, a Pax5 repressed

INTRODUCTION
The PAX5 gene belongs to the PAX gene family
of transcription factors and is essential for B cell
commitment [1]. It functions both as a transcriptional
activator and a repressor of different target genes
involved in lineage development. Furthermore, PAX5
has been recently reported to be target of aberrancies,
including mutations, deletions and translocations, in
about 30% of pediatric patients affected by BCP-ALL, [2]
the most frequent leukemia subset in children [3]. PAX5
translocations occur in approximately 2–3% of patients,
[4] with a variety of partner genes, such as transcription
factors, kinases, structural proteins and others [2, 4, 5].

target gene, which has a potential role in a wide range of
hematological malignancies [12–16] and interestingly, acts
as an inducer of Stat5 hyper-phosphorylation in Ba/F3 pro-B
cells [17].
We and others previously contributed in describing
the ability of PAX5/ETV6 and other PAX5 fusion proteins
in impairing the rearrangement of the μ heavy chain and
down-regulating the expression of genes involved in the
signaling pathway downstream of the pre-BCR, [11] a
mechanism known to be responsible not only for pre-BI cells
differentiation but also for their proliferation and survival.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to test
the hypothesis that the activation of STAT5 through LCK
up-regulation could represent a pro-survival signaling
pathway activated by PAX5 fusion proteins and alternative
to the pre-BCR, switched-off in this context. Primary
cultures of wild type (wt) pre-BI cells stably transduced
with the retroviral PAX5/ETV6 vector and patients
primary cells carrying PAX5 fusion genes were used to
model this hypothesis.

causing Lck over-activation (Figure 1C-D, Supplementary
Figure S1B-C, Supplementary Figure S2B-C).
Lck phosphorylation in the Y505 residue is
regulated by the C-terminal Src kinase Csk, which induces
a close conformation to the Lck protein, thus preventing
the accessibility to its catalytic domain [19]. Indeed, we
observed a significant down-regulation of Csk expression,
which could be responsible for the de-phosphorylation
at the Lck inhibitory domain (Figure 1E, Supplementary
Figure S1D and S2D). Moreover the Lck target Zap70
was found up-regulated in all the pre-BI cell populations
(Figure 1F, Supplementary Figure S1E and S2E).

PAX5 fusion genes lead to LCK up-regulation
in human primary cells
In 5 BCP-ALL cases carrying PAX5 juxtaposed
to several partner genes, [20] namely PAX5/AUTS2
(n = 2), PAX5/CHFR (n = 1), PAX5/SOX5 (n = 1) and
PAX5/POM121C (n = 1) LCK was found up-regulated
(mean FC = 6.27, p < 0.05), compared to PAX5 wt
­BCP-ALL patients (n = 5), whereas PAX5 deleted cases
showed only a higher trend of LCK transcript levels
(Figure 2A). Patients’ clinical and cytogenetics features
are reported in Table 1.
To better characterize the patients cohort considered
for this study, we performed MLPA analysis of BM
diagnostic samples (Supplementary Table S1). All the
PAX5 deleted cases presented CDKN2A/CDKN2B
deletions (2 of them homozigous), possibly reflecting
a larger deletion on chromosome 9. Patient number 9
showed IKZF1 and BTG1 deletions as well, and patient
7 showed IKZF1 deletion. Therefore, at best of this
knowledge, there is no evident correlation between gene
deletions and different LCK expression levels.
Out of the 5 cases carrying PAX5 translocations,
cells were available from only 3 patients (namely, 2
PAX5/AUTS2 and PAX5/SOX5). Therefore, due to the
small quantity of the samples, we expanded the cells
by intravenous injection into NOD/SCID mice. When
the mice became ill due to overt leukemia, they were
sacrificed, and leukemia cells were harvested from the
bone marrow. Leukemic infiltration was confirmed by
flow cytometry, as shown in Supplementary Figure S3.
Quantitative PCR confirmed that LCK was up-regulated
in PAX5 translocated patient-derived xenograft BM cells
(mean FC = 21.58, p < 0.01) (Figure 2A), demonstrating
that are representative of diagnostic samples.
At protein level, PAX5 haplo-insufficiency
resulted in LCK over-expression compared to wt PAX5
status (densitometry analysis: LCK mean = 0.08, 0.18,
0.17 (arbitrary unit) in PAX5 wt, PAX5 deleted, and
PAX5 translocated cases, respectively) (Figure 2B-C).
In addition, PAX5 fusion proteins induced marked
de-phosphorylation of the LCK inhibitory domain,
thus causing LCK o
­ver-activation (LCKY505/LCK

RESULTS
Lck is up-regulated in PAX5/ETV6
transduced pre-BI cells
We recently reported that gene expression profiling
(GEP) of PAX5/ETV6 transduced pre-BI revealed the
up-regulation of the Pax5 repressed target gene Lck
(FC = 1.63, p < 0.05) [11, 18].
Quantitative PCR confirmed Lck over-expression at
basal level in PAX5/ETV6 transduced pre-BI cells compared
to the empty vector control (MIGR-GFP) (FC = 2.04, 1.55,
1.78, in LY5.1FL, B6BAFL and FLB6-67, respectively;
p < 0.001) (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure S1A and
S2A). After synchronization by overnight withdrawal of IL7,
Lck over-expression was confirmed at all the time points,
namely 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours, with FC = 7.96 p < 0.001,
FC = 15.93 p < 0.01, FC = 3.83 p < 0.001, FC = 4.32
p < 0.001 respectively, as shown in Figure 1B.

Lck kinase activity is enhanced in PAX5/ETV6
positive cells
Lck kinase activity is regulated via the reversible
phosphorylation of the negative regulatory Y505 residue
in the C-terminal segment, thus inducing the clamp of the
C-tail on its own SH2 domain, locking the kinase in an
inactive, closed conformation [19].
The total Lck protein level was up-regulated (mean
FC = 1.79, range 1.42–2.48, p < 0.01; mean FC = 1.97, range
1.10–3.02, p < 0.05; mean FC = 1.12, range 1.06–1.40, n.s.,
in LY5.1FL, B6BAFL and FLB6-67 cells, respectively),
and PAX5/ETV6 induced a statistically significant
de-phosphorylation of the Lck inhibitory domain (LckY505),

signaling is fundamental not only for their differentiation,
but also for their survival and proliferation together with the
IL7R pathway, [21] which leads to Stat5 phosphorylation
and the consequential activation of cell cycle progression
inducers. Since PAX5/ETV6 provided a survival advantage
upon IL7 withdrawal, [10] we wondered if it could be due
to constitutive, ligand-independent over-activation of the

IL7R-Stat5 pathway. This could be exerted through Lck
over-expression, which had been previously described
to induce Stat5 hyper-phosphorylation in Ba/F3 pro-B
cells [17].
Indeed, phosphoflow analysis of PAX5/ETV6
transduced cells, revealed increased Stat5 phosphorylation
after IL7 stimulation both at basal level and in time course
experiments (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure S4A, S5A
and S6A), as confirmed by western blot (Supplementary
Figure S4B, S5A and S6A). However, IL7Rα (CD127)
was expressed at the same level both in PAX5/ETV6 and
MIGR-GFP cells (Supplementary Figure S4C, S5B and
S6B) [21].
Downstream in the pathway, we observed the
up-regulation of cMyc and Ccnd2, at early and late
time points after IL7 stimulation, thus indicating that
Stat5 hyper-phosphorylation led to the activation of
the transcription of its target genes (Figure 3B-C,
Supplementary Figure S4D-E, S5C-D, S6C-D) [22].

in PAX5/ETV6 cells, as indicated by the decreased number
of positive cells and the Mean Fluorescence Intensity
(MFI), while it had no effect on MIGR-GFP control,
where Lck is expressed at lower levels (Figure 4A-B).
Overall, this supports the specificity of Lck activity on
cell survival. By tracking of the replication cycles, we
demonstrated that BIBF1120 reduces the replicative rate
of PAX5/ETV6 cells, thus strikingly abrogating their
proliferative advantage (Figure 4C). Indeed, cell cycle
analysis showed that BIBF1120 reduced the increase in
the replicative S phase exclusively in PAX5/ETV6 cells
(Supplementary Figure S7A-B).

The LCK inhibitor BIBF1120 is a novel potential
candidate to target PAX5 translocated ALL
In order to verify if LCK over-expression led
to STAT5 hyper-phosphorylation also in BCP-ALL
cases, we perfomed phosphoflow analyses on frozen
samples. Despite the low basal level of activation, PAX5
translocated cells were more responsive to stimulation
with hIL7 compared to cells from non-PAX5 translocated
patients (% STAT5Y694 cells mean = 3.36, 5.17, 13.27
in PAX5 wt, PAX5 deleted, and PAX5 translocated cells,
respectively; Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure S8).

Moreover, after co-culture of human blast cells
on OP9 stroma, PAX5 translocated cases showed higher
STAT5 activation both at basal level (% STAT5Y694 cells
mean = 2.73, 5.24, 19.98 in PAX5 wt, PAX5 deleted, and

9.49, 33.33 in PAX5 wt, PAX5 deleted, and PAX5
translocated cells, respectively; p < 0.001) (Figure 5B
and Supplementary Figure S9). In addition, overnight
treatment with BIBF1120 (50nM) reduced STAT5
phosphorylation to levels similar to PAX5 wt and PAX5
deleted patients (% STAT5Y694 cells mean = 2.46, 5.77,
7.40 in PAX5 wt, PAX5 deleted, and PAX5 translocated
cells, respectively; p < 0.05) and prevented STAT5
activation upon stimulation with hL7 (% STAT5Y694 cells
mean = 5.81, 9.61, 7.38 in PAX5 wt, PAX5 deleted, and
PAX5 translocated cells, respectively; n.s.), as shown in
Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S9.

Furthermore, overnight administration of BIBF1120
was able to induce cell death in a proportional manner to
LCK mRNA level. In particular, LCK levels were inversely
correlated to cell viability (10 out of 12 patients with
a minimal cellular viability of 15% were considered),
(Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure S10). This
makes BIBF1120 a candidate drug to target PAX5
translocated ALL.

DISCUSSION
The role of PAX5 fusion genes in leukemogenesis
and transformation events is not fully understood yet.
It has been demonstrated that PAX5/ETV6, as well as
other PAX5 fusion proteins, impair the expression of the
μ heavy chain and down-regulates pre-BCR associated
molecules at the surface level [23]. In the present study,

cells. (B) Overnight in vitro co-culture of blast cells on OP9 stroma confirmed that PAX5 translocated cells show a higher STAT5 activation
profile compared to PAX5 wt and PAX5 deleted patients. Stimulation with hIL7 increased the level of STAT5Y694 positive cells and PAX5

fusion gene positive cells, but it doesn’t exert any significant effect on PAX5 wt and PAX5 deleted cells. Treatment with BIBF1120 abolishes
the effect of stimulation with hIL7 in PAX5 translocated cases, keeping the percentage of STAT5 activated cells similar to the levels of the
other groups. (C) LCK levels are inversely correlated to leukemia cells viability. Test t, *p < 0.05; **p< 0.01; ***p < 0.001.

we wanted to test the hypothesis that the activation of
Stat5 through Lck up-regulation could represent a prosurvival signaling pathway activated by PAX5 fusion
proteins and alternative to the non-functional pre-BCR.
Indeed, we initially showed Lck over-expression
in an in vitro model of murine wt pre-BI cell populations
co-coltured on OP9 stroma and transduced with PAX5/
ETV6. We demonstrated that, despite a moderate overexpression of the total form of Lck protein, Lck was
significantly de-phosphorylated in the inhibitory residue
LckY505, thus causing Lck over-activation. Further
confirming the de-phosphorylation at the Lck inhibitory
domain, we demonstrated the down-regulation of the
C terminal Src kinase (Csk) in PAX5/ETV6 cells.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Indeed, Csk regulates Lck phosphorylation at the
residue Y505, thus inducing the clamp of Lck C-tail on
its own SH2 domain, locking the kinase in an inactive,
closed conformation. As a confirmation of Lck hyperactivation, we demonstrated the up-regulation of its target
Zap70 [19].
Thereby, in PAX5/ETV6 cells Lck could be overactivated through two main mechanisms: a) the PAX5/ETV6
mediated up-regulation of Lck transcription; b) the downregulation of Csk, thus resulting in the de-phosphorylation of
its inhibitory domain. The same mechanism can potentially
be hypothesized for other PAX5 fusion proteins.
Importantly, for the first time we showed LCK overexpression in bone marrow primary cells from leukemic

1576

patients carrying at diagnosis different PAX5 fusion
genes, [20] thus demonstrating that this is a common
feature of PAX5 translocations.
At protein level, not only PAX5 translocated,
but also PAX5 deleted patients showed higher LCK
expression compared to PAX5 wt cases, as a result of the
PAX5 haploinsufficiency on its physiological repressed
targets. However, exclusively PAX5 fusion genes induced
de-phosphorylation at the LCKY505 residue, thus resulting
in LCK over-activation, while PAX5 deleted patients didn’t
display strikingly over-activation of LCK. Taken together,
these data suggest that LCK over-expression, together
with its over-activation, is specifically associated to the
dominant activity of PAX5 fusion proteins and contributes
to the biological distinction of the PAX5 translocated from
PAX5 deleted patients.
In murine pre-BI cells, the survival and proliferation
role of the pre-BCR signaling is exerted together with the
IL7R pathway, [21] which leads to Stat5 phosphorylation,
and consequentially activation of cell cycle progression
inducers. However, we previously demonstrated that
PAX5/ETV6 cells do not express a functional pre-BCR
[11] and they show a short term survival advantage
upon IL7 withdrawal, which could be due to the
constitutive, ligand-independent over-activation of the
IL7R-Stat5 pathway. Interestingly, Lck over-expression
had been previously described to induce Stat5 hyperphosphorylation in Ba/F3 pro-B cells and in T lymphoma
cells as well [17, 24]. This feature resembles what reported
in Ph+ BCP-ALL cases, where blasts do not express a
functional pre-BCR, but they show STAT5 over-activation
[25–27].
Indeed, we demonstrated by phosphoflow analysis
that PAX5/ETV6 transduced cells showed increased Stat5
phosphorylation, and the up-regulation of two downstream
targets cMyc and Ccnd2, known to have a role in cell cycle
progression and malignant transformation [22, 28, 29]. We
also demonstrated that IL7Rα (CD127) was expressed at
the same level both in PAX5/ETV6 and MIGR-GFP cells,
thus suggesting that increased Stat5 phosphorylation was
independent from classical IL7R signaling cascade [21].
Moreover, PAX5/ETV6 pre-BI cells display
additional typical features of oncogenic transformation,
such as an increased replicative S phase population and
a faster replication rate. This phenomenon may be caused
by Stat5 hyper-phosphorylation, together with the downregulation of tumor suppressor genes (Gadd45b and
Lats2) [11, 30, 31].
In the human setting, we confirmed that LCK overexpression leads to the over-activation of STAT5 signaling
pathway both at the basal level and after stimulation with
hIL7 in PAX5 translocated cases, compared to PAX5 wt
and PAX5 deleted blast cells.
Interestingly, STAT5 over-activation and PAX5
haplo-insufficiency have been described as synergistic
players to initiate ALL [28, 32]. In the present study
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we demonstrated that both these aberrancies are not
only necessary to drive leukemia, but they are a direct
consequence of the expression of the PAX5 fusion
protein, which can a) repress the activity of endogenous
PAX5 [11] and b) activate STAT5 through LCK
(Figure 6).
In this scenario, PAX5/ETV6 (and PAX5 fusion
proteins in general) share some features of BCR-ABL1
leukemic transformation: a) both the fusion genes impair
the μ heavy chain rearrangement and the pre-BCR
exposure on the cellular surface; [10, 11, 26] and b) both
induce STAT5 hyper-phosphorylation, via LCK in PAX5
translocated cases and via BCR/ABL1 itself in Ph+ cells,
respectively [25, 26, 32]. This similarity might at least
partly explain the relatively frequent occurrence of PAX5
abnormalities in Ph-like ALL [33].
The LCK inhibitor BIBF1120 specifically abrogated
the survival advantages of both murine PAX5/ETV6 preBI cells and PAX5 translocated blast cells, down-tuning
STAT5 phosphorylation and preventing the effect of
stimulation with IL7, indicating the specificity of the LCK
direct mechanism (Figure 6).
LCK has recently been reported as a key molecule in
multiple subsets of leukemia. Indeed, LCK over-activation
has been found to correlate with poor response to treatment
in pediatric BCP-ALL patients, [12] M
­ LL-rearranged
ALL [13] and in chronic lymphoblastic leukemia
(CLL), [14, 15] thus proposing LCK activation as a putative
marker for glucocorticoid resistance. Moreover, LCK has
been also shown to be essential for the proliferation and
survival in a subset of T-ALL characterized by NUP214/
ABL1 activity (6% of T-ALL cases) [16].
Besides BIBF1120, LCK has been found as a target
of several tyrosine kynase inhibitors, such as Imatinib and
Dasatinib, and it has been demonstrated in multiple studies
that TKI treatment specifically down-regulates LCK
expression and diminishes LCK activation [14, 34, 35].
Therefore, the LCK driven oncogenic signaling may
candidate tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a possible treatment
for PAX5 translocated patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ethic statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authors’
institutional review board.

Patients’ cohort
PAX5 translocated (n = 5), PAX5 deleted (n = 4) and
PAX5 wt (n = 5) pediatric BCP-ALL cases enrolled in the
AIEOP-BFM ALL2000 protocol and selected based on
1577

Figure 6: Mechanism of action of PAX5 fusion proteins in BCP-ALL. The pre-BCR is not expressed in PAX5 translocated blast

cells (A), causing the typical proliferation advantage and differentiation block of BCP-ALL (B). In particular, PAX5 fusion proteins cause
the up-regulation of LCK and its over-activation (C). LCK over-activation leads to STAT5 hyper-phosphorylation (D), thus sustaining
proliferation and survival of blast cells via the transcription of STAT5 target genes (E). The administration of the LCK inhibitor BIBF1120
reverts this phenomenon, down-tuning STAT5 signaling (F).

cytogenetics and FISH were considered for this study [20].

kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using
125 ng of genomic DNA. The assays were performed
according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Electrophoresis
and quantification of fluorescein amidite-labeled amp icons
were performed on an ABI-3130 genetic analyzer (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting peak intensities
were normalized to the manufacturers’ control probes and
to normal DNA as a reference. An intensity ratio between
0.75 and 1.3 was considered to represent a normal copy
number, a ratio between 0.25 and 0.75 a monoallelic

Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe

deletion, and a ratio < 0.25 a biallelic deletion. The results
of MLPA analysis are reported in Supplementary Table S1.

BM cells (1 × 106) collected at the diagnosis of
PAX5 translocated BCP-ALL patients were inoculated
via intravenous injection into NOD/SCID mice (Charles
River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) after
sublethal irradiation (125 Rad) with Radgil (Gilardoni,
Mandello (LC), Italy). When the mice became ill due to
overt leukemia, they were sacrificed, and leukemia cells
were harvested from bone marrow and spleen. Leukemic
infiltration was confirmed by flow cytometry, as shown in
Supplementary Figure 3.

Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen, Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, California, USA) was used for cDNA
synthesis. Primers and probes for real time quantitative
PCR were selected according to the Software Probe
Finder (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Data
were expressed using the comparative ΔΔCt method. In
the murine setting, the Hprt transcript was considered
as a reference and MIGR-GFP cells as standardization
control, whereas in human cell samples the ABL1 gene
was selected as a housekeeping gene, and PAX5 wt
patients as standardization controls [36]. Both t test and
SD values refer to triplicates of a single experiment and
3 independent experiments were performed for each
gene. Primers and probes are reported in Supplementary
Table S2.

Cell cultures

Phosphoflow analysis

Phoenix packaging cell line was cultured in DMEM
high glucose, in the presence of 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) at 37°C and
5% CO2. OP9 stroma cells were cultured in Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium, supplemented with 5 × 105 mol/L of
h-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmol/L of glutamine, 0.03% w/v
primatone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA),
100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 Ag/mL of streptomycin,
and 20% FBS at 37°C and 10% CO2. Wt murine pre-BI cell
populations, namely LY5.1FL, B6BAFL and FLB6-67, were
isolated from the fetal liver of donor mice as previously
described, [10] and co-cultured on OP9 stroma in Iscove’s
modified Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 2%
FBS, 0.03% w/v primatone, and 5% mIL7 at 37°C and
10% CO2 and transduced with either MIGR-PAX5/ETV6
or MIGR-GFP vector [10, 11]. Representative phenotype
analyses are reported in Supplementary Figures S11–13.
Patients BM cells were co-cultured on OP9 stroma in MEM
alpha medium supplemented with Glutamax (Gibco, Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA) and 20% FBS, at
37°C and 10% CO2.

Human BM cells were stimulated with hIL7 (50 ng/ml)
for 30 minutes, whereas murine pre-BI cells were stimulated
with 5% mIL7 after synchronization by overnight
mIL7 withdrawal. Afterwards, cells were harvested at
different time points, fixed in 1.5% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilized with 90% Methanol according to Nolan’s Lab
protocol (http://www.cytobank.org/nolanlab/experiment_
protocols/general_protocol.html). Samples were stored in
90% methanol at −20°C. After recovering, they were stained
by specific antibodies (Supplementary Table S3).

Primary leukemia cell xenograft

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in Tris-HCl pH 7.4 20mM,
NaCl 20mM, EDTA pH8 2mM, Na3VO4 0.2mM, Triton 1%,
NaF 25mM, β-glycerolphosphate 25mM, PMSF 1mM,
Protease inhibitor cocktail 1x. StripAblot Stripping
Buffer (Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy) was used to recover
membranes. Densitometry analyses were performed
using Alliance instrument and Uviband software (Uvitec
Cambridge, UK). Antibodies are listed in Supplementary
Table S4.

Retroviral transduction

BIBF1120 treatment

Wt pre-BI cell populations were transduced
with either MIGR-PAX5/ETV6 or MIGR-GFP vector.
The retroviral supernatant was obtained using MIRUS
transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, Wisconsin,
USA) and Phoenix packaging cell line according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. On day +3 post transduction,
the GFP positive cells were sorted using FACS Aria sorter
(Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, California, USA).

Murine pre-BI cells were treated with either
50nM LCK inhibitor BIBF1120 (Selleckchem, Houston,
Texas, USA) or vehicle (DMSO) after synchronization
by overnight IL7 withdrawal. Human blast cells were
cultured overnight with 50nM LCK inhibitor BIBF1120
or vehicle.

Viability assay

Reverse transcription-PCR and real-time
quantitative-PCR assays

The viability of human leukemia cells was evaluated
by staining with BD Fixable Viability Stain V450,
according to manufacturer’s protocol, and analyzed by BD
FacsCanto II (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose,
California, USA).

RNA extraction was performed using TRIZOL
reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
California, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol.
