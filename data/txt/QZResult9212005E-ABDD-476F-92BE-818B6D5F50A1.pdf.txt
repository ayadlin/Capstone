BACKGROUND. Radioimmunotherapy with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to
CD20 produces a high response rate in patients with recurring non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL), but the durability of those remissions is not well defined.

METHODS. Data on patients with recurring NHL treated with yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in 4 clinical trials were reviewed to identify patients with a
long-term response, defined as a time to progression of 12 months or longer.

RESULTS. Long-term responses were seen in 37% (78/211) of patients. At a median
follow-up of 53.5 months (range, 12.7–88.9) the median duration of response was
28.1 months and the median time to progression was 29.3 months. A third of these
patients had been treated with at least 3 previous therapies, and 37% of them had
not responded to their last therapy. The findings in patients with follicular lym-

adioimmunotherapy (RIT) involves the use of monoclonal antibodies labeled with a radioactive nuclide for therapeutic intent.
Two RIT agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of recurring or refractory CD201
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)—yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan
(Biogen Idec, Cambridge, Mass) and iodine I 131 tositumomab
(GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC). Both agents target
the B-cell CD20 antigen, which is present on more than 90% of Bcell NHL tumors.1 The chelation of the 90Y radionuclide results in
the delivery of cytotoxic radiation to nearby cells in addition to
those to which the antibody has bound.2 The b emissions of 90Y
have a maximum energy of 2.3 MeV3,4 and their mean path length
in soft tissue is 5 mm (100–200 cell diameters). The ibritumomab
tiuxetan regimen also includes the unlabeled antibody rituximab,

which is given before the radiolabeled antibody to
saturate CD20 binding sites on B cells in the peripheral blood and spleen and thereby improve the biodistribution of the radiolabeled antibody.5
The overall response (OR) rates in clinical trials
of the ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen in patients
with recurring or refractory NHL have been 73% to
83%.6–10 In 1 of these trials, a randomized study that
compared the ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen with
rituximab monotherapy, the OR and complete
response (CR) rates were higher with the radioimmunoconjugate.6 The primary toxicity of the ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen is transient and reversible
myelosuppression.11
Data from the 4 registration trials of the ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen show a high OR rate
in patients with recurring or refractory B-cell
NHL.7,8,12,13 To determine the durability of these
responses and to characterize the role of patient and
disease factors in patients with a long-term response
(LTR), we evaluated data on the patients in the 4
registration trials in whom the time to progression
(TTP) after treatment with the ibritumomab tiuxetan
regimen was 12 months or longer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
In all, 211 patients were treated in 4 clinical trials at
30 centers in the United States—a Phase I-II dosefinding trial in patients with indolent and aggressive
NHL, a Phase II trial of reduced-dose 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients with mild thrombocytopenia, a randomized Phase III trial that compared the
ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen with rituximab monotherapy, and a Phase III trial in patients with rituximab-refractory NHL. The eligibility criteria for these
studies have been described.6,8–10
Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Regimen
On Day 1 the patients were given an infusion of
rituximab 250 mg/m2 followed within 4 hours by an
intravenous injection of indium 111 ibritumomab
tiuxetan 5 mCi for imaging. On Days 7, 8, or 9 they
were given another infusion of rituximab 250 mg/m2
followed by an intravenous injection of 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan given over 10 minutes. The dose of 90Y
ibritumomab tiuxetan was 0.2 to 0.4 mCi/kg, to a
maximum total dose of 32 mCi.
Efficacy and Safety Measures
The primary efficacy measures were CR, CR unconfirmed (CRu), partial response, TTP, and duration of
response (DR). Both the protocol-defined criteria and

the International Workshop Response Criteria were
used to assess responses. A TTP of at least 12 months
after treatment with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan was
considered an LTR. The DR and TTP were determined in all patients with an LTR and in those with
a CR/CRu; the DR in patients with an ongoing
response was also calculated. All adverse events,
along with other measures of safety, that occurred in
the treatment period (from the first dose of rituximab to 12 weeks after the dose of 90Y ibritumomab
tiuxetan) and in the initial follow-up period (up to 4
years after the start of treatment) were evaluated and
have been reported.11 Information on disease progression and survival is collected every 6 months.

Statistical Analysis
Pretreatment characteristics and prognostic factors in
the entire population, patients with LTR, and patients
without LTR were described by using summary statistics from univariate analysis. Patient characteristics
were compared between groups by using the Fisher
exact 2-tailed test, with P < .05 considered significant.
Time-to-event variables (DR, TTP, and overall survival)
were analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method.14
Time to progression was calculated as the time from
the first infusion of rituximab (Day 1) to the time of disease progression; DR was calculated as the time from
the first observation of a response to the time of disease progression. A stepwise logistic regression model
was used for an exploratory multivariate analysis of the
effect of pretreatment factors on predicting the
patients in whom there would be an LTR. In this stepwise selection a .10 significance level determined
whether a factor entered into and remained in the
model. The multivariate analysis model of the LTR outcome included CR/CRu status, sex, age (60 vs
>60 years), number of previous therapies (<3 vs 3),
histology type (follicular vs other), disease bulk (<5 vs
5 cm), bone marrow involvement (presence vs
absence), splenomegaly (presence vs absence), hepatomegaly (presence vs absence), number of extra nodal
sites (1 vs >1), and resistance to last chemotherapy
(yes vs no). The odds ratios and their 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated for the factors that were
retained in the final model.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Characteristics of the 211 patients in the 4 clinical
trials are shown in Table 1. There were LTRs in 78
(37%) of 211 patients. The number and percentage of
patients with an LTR differed by study—22 patients

Phase II trial in rituximab-refractory NHL.8 The median age of these 78 patients was 58 years (range,
24–80), 44% were older than 60 years, and 55% were
men (see Table 1). Most of them (76%) had follicular
lymphoma, and 41% had marrow involvement. They
had been treated with a median of 2 previous regimens (range, 1–7), with 59% having been treated
with 2 or more and 33% having been treated with 3
or more. The disease appeared to be resistant to
therapeutic intervention in a substantial number of
patients, with 37% having not responded to their last
therapy. There was bulky disease (5 cm) in 30% of
the patients with an LTR and in 72% of these without
an LTR (P < .001). Eighty-three percent of patients
with an LTR had stage III or IV disease compared
with 92% of patients without an LTR (P ¼ .13). The
median DR with the last therapy before 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients with an LTR was 12 months.
The percentages of patients with bulky disease, with
more than 2 previous therapies, and with disease
that was resistant to their last therapy were lower in
the patients with an LTR than in those without an
LTR (all P < .01). There were LTRs in 59 (39%) of the
153 patients with follicular lymphoma, and the
patient and disease characteristics in them were similar to those in the overall population of patients
with LTRs (see Table 1).

LTR showed that CR/CRu, nonbulky disease, and
stage I or II disease at initial presentation were significant predictors (Table 2). The achievement of a
CR/CRu was a strong positive predictor of an LTR,
with an odds ratio of 7.0 (95% CI, 3.4–14.5). Bulky
disease was a negative predictor of an LTR. Stage I or
II NHL was a significant positive predictor of an LTR,
but, because only 24 patients had stage I or II disease, it was considered a less important factor. Alternatively, older age (>60 years) and elevated lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) level, among other characteristics, did not significantly impact the likelihood of
achieving an LTR with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan.

Durability of Responses in Patients With LTRs
At a median follow-up of 53.5 months (range, 12.7–
88.9) the median DR in the 78 patients with an LTR
was 28.1 months (range, 10.5–86.61) and the median
TTP was 29.3 months (range, 12.1–87.81) (Table 3).

* There were ongoing responses at the time of analysis in 23 patients, 21 of whom had follicular
non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

In 29% of these patients the DR was at least 72
months (Fig. 1) and the TTP was at least 73 months.

Durability of Responses by Histology and Response
to Previous Therapy
The DR, TTP, and CR/CRu rates in patients with follicular lymphoma in whom there were LTRs were
similar to those in the overall population of patients
with LTRs (see Table 3). The median TTP in patients
who had responded to their last therapy was 26.1
months and in those who had not responded to their
last therapy was 28.3 months (P ¼ .98) (Fig. 2A). In
addition, there were no significant differences in the
median TTP among patients with LTRs on the basis
of previous exposure to rituximab (P ¼ .54), disease
bulk (P ¼ .69), CR/CRu status (P ¼ .62), or disease
histology (P ¼ .12) (Fig. 2B–E). This suggests that,
whereas some factors such as resistance to previous
therapies, bulky disease, and achievement of a PR
(instead of a CR) may indicate a lower probability of
attaining a LTR, these factors do not compromise the
durability of the responses to 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan if indeed an LTR is achieved.
Overall Survival
Median overall survival in all 211 patients was 49.3
months. Overall survival was 52 months or longer
in 82% of the patients with LTRs (Figure 3), and
median survival has not been reached. In contrast,
median overall survival in patients without an LTR
was 34.6 months. The estimated 5-year overall survival was 53.0% for all patients and 80.6% for
patients with LTRs.

FIGURE 1. Duration of response in patients with long-term responses and
in the intent-to-treat population. Information on duration of response was not
available in 50 patients in the intent-to-treat population.

Durability of Responses in Patients With CR/CRu and
Ongoing Responses
There was a CR/CRu in 51 (65%) of the 78 patients
with LTRs. The median DR in these patients was 29.4
months (range, 10.8–86.61), and the median TTP was
30.9 months (range, 12.1–87.81) (see Table 3). At the
time of this analysis, the disease had not experienced
recurrence in 23 patients, 21 of whom had follicular
lymphoma. The median DR in these 23 patients was
62 months (range, 48–871) (see Table 3).

DISCUSSION
Treating recurring or refractory NHL with a single
dose of RIT in an outpatient setting produces a high
OR rate of approximately 80%. In this long-term follow-up study in 211 patients treated with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in registration trials there was a
TTP of 12 months or longer in 37% of patients. Predicting the patients in whom RIT will produce an
LTR is difficult. For example, the patients in this
study in whom there were LTRs had been treated
with a median of 2 previous therapies, and more
than 80% of them had stage III or IV disease. Close
to half of them were older than 60 years, a third of
them had been treated with 3 or more previous
therapies, and more than a third of them had not
responded to their last therapy. The only pretreatment characteristics that predicted an LTR with RIT
were nonbulky disease (<5 cm) and stage I or II
disease.
Whether the patient had responded to his or her
last previous therapy had no effect on the likelihood
of an LTR with the ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen,
nor did patient age or the number of previous therapies. It is important to note that the best predictor of
an LTR to RIT was a CR/CRu. These findings are

comparable to those in a recent report by Fisher
et al.15 who reviewed data on 250 patients with
recurring or refractory low-grade or transformed
NHL who had been treated with a single dose of 131I
tositumomab. The OR in these 250 patients was 56%
(CR rate of 30%), with a median DR of 12.9 months
(range, 10.6–17.3). In that report LTRs were referred
to as durable responses (also defined as a TTP 12

months) and were achieved in 81 (32%) of 250
patients, comparable to the LTR rate of 37% in our
study. They also found that the patients with a durable response were more likely to have had a CR
(77% vs 8%, respectively) and low-bulk disease (51%
vs 31%, respectively) than those without a durable
response. Other characteristics that were predictive
of a durable response with 131I tositumomab treat-

recur after RIT.20 Whether treating bulky tumor sites
with external beam radiation before or after RIT can
increase the response rates or the duration of
response remains to be studied.
This study also shows the excellent overall survival in this population of patients with LTRs (see
Fig. 3). It has been shown that chemotherapy, transplantation,21,22 and retreatment with RIT23 can all be
effective in patients in whom there is recurrence
after RIT. Radioimmunotherapy is clearly an effective
therapy that should be used early in patients with
recurring disease rather than only after all other
options have been expended.

ment were sensitivity to the last therapy, history of
<3 previous therapies, follicular histology, normal
LDH level, and modified International Prognostic
Index (IPI) score 2. In a study of 131I tositumomab
in patients with previously untreated follicular NHL
by Kaminski et al.16 the only patients with extended
remissions were those who had a CR.
These findings are important for the design of
future trials. Patients with bulky NHL may benefit
from tumor debulking before treatment with RIT,
and patients who have a response but have residual
disease may benefit from additional treatment aimed
at converting a partial response to a CR. In the trials
that are analyzed in this report, neither treatment
before the RIT nor after the RIT to convert a partial
response to a CR was permitted. It is now time to
build on the very high response rates and excellent
safety profile with single-agent RIT by incorporating
other treatments along with functional imaging, such
as positron emission tomography, into clinical practice, with the goal of producing CRs. This approach
would be expected to produce very long responses in
a higher percentage of patients than in this analysis.
Indeed, several ongoing studies are evaluating the
safety and efficacy of frontline treatment with RIT in
combination with other therapies.
Shipley et al.17 reported that the ibritumomab
tiuxetan regimen is active and well tolerated as
frontline consolidation therapy for follicular NHL,
and Emmanouilides et al.18 reported higher response rates and more durable responses with the
ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen when it is used earlier in the course of treatment. In a small study in
patients with low-grade follicular lymphoma, frontline therapy with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan followed
by rituximab maintenance therapy produced responses in all 8 patients.19 External beam radiation
has been shown to be effective in treating sites that
