COMPREHENSIVE MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF
CLEAR CELL RENAL CELL CARCINOMA
The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network

Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Genetic changes underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) include alterations in genes
controlling cellular oxygen sensing (e.g. VHL) and the maintenance of chromatin states (e.g.
PBRM1). We surveyed more than 400 tumors using different genomic platforms and identified 19
significantly mutated genes. The PI3K/Akt pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this
pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread DNA hypomethylation was associated with
mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2, and integrative analysis suggested that
mutations involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4)
could have far-reaching effects on other pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a
metabolic shift, involving down-regulation of genes involved in the TCA cycle, decreased AMPK
and PTEN protein levels, up-regulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine
transporter genes, increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of
miR-21 and GRB10. Remodeling cellular metabolism thus constitutes a recurrent pattern in ccRCC
that correlates with tumor stage and severity and offers new views on the opportunities for disease
treatment.

Kidney cancers, or renal cell carcinomas (RCC), are a common group of chemotherapy
resistant diseases that can be distinguished by histopathological features and underlying
gene mutations.1 Inherited predisposition to RCC has been shown to arise from genes
involved in regulating cellular metabolism, making RCC a model for the role of an
oncologic-metabolic shift, commonly referred to as the “Warburg effect”, leading to
malignancy.2 The most common type of RCC, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), is
closely associated with VHL gene mutations that lead to stabilization of hypoxia inducible
factors (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) in both sporadic and familial forms. PBRM1, a subunit of the
PBAF SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, as well as histone deubiquitinase BAP1
and histone methyltransferase SETD2, were recently found to be altered in 41%, 15% and
12% of ccRCCs, respectively3–5, implicating major roles for epigenetic regulation of
additional functional pathways participating in the development and progression of the
disease. Oncogenic metabolism and epigenetic reprogramming have thus emerged as central
features of ccRCC.

In the present study, clinical and pathological features, genomic alterations, DNA
methylation profiles, and RNA and proteomic signatures were evaluated in ccRCC. We
accrued more than 500 primary nephrectomy specimens from patients with histologically
confirmed ccRCC that conformed to the requirements for genomic study defined by the
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)6, together with matching ‘normal’ genomic material.
Samples were restricted to those that contained at least 60% tumor nuclei, (median 85%) by
pathological review (clinical data summary provided in Table S1). A data freeze
representing 446 samples was generated from at least one analytical platform (‘Extended’
data set) and data from all platforms were available for 372 samples for coordinated,
integrative analyses (‘Core’ data set)(Data File S1, Table S2). No substantial batch effects in
the data that might confound analyses were detected (Figures S1–S20).

Somatic Alterations
Author Manuscript

The global pattern of somatic alterations, determined from analysis of 417 samples, is shown
in Figure 1A. DNA hybridizations showed that recurrent arm-level and focal somatic copy
number alterations (SCNAs) occurred at a fewer sites than is generally observed in other
cancers (p<0.0004; Figures S21–S22, Table S3). However, SCNAs that were observed more
commonly involved entire chromosomes or chromosome arms, rather than focal events
(17% vs 0.4%, Figure 1b). Notably, the most frequent arm-level events involved loss of
chromosome 3p3 (91% of samples), encompassing all of the four most commonly mutated
genes (VHL, PBRM1, BAP1 and SETD2).

Author Manuscript

The data also suggested lower and more variable tumor cellularity7 in the accrued samples,
compared to conventional pathological review (median 54% ± 14%). This may reflect
stromal or endothelial cell contributions, or tumor cell heterogeneity. A recent study of
multiple samples from single tumors has demonstrated significant regional genomic
heterogeneity, but with shared mutations in frequently mutated genes and convergent
evolution of other common gene level events.8 The mutation frequencies of key genes (VHL,
PBRM1, etc.), as well as copy number gains and losses found here, were, however,
consistent with previous reports. Tumor purity was therefore not determined to be a
limitation in the current study.

Author Manuscript

Arm level losses on chromosome 14q, associated with loss of HIF1A, which has been
predicted to drive more aggressive disease9, were also frequent (45% of samples). Gains of
5q were observed (67% of samples) and additional focal amplifications refined the region of
interest to 60 genes in 5q35, which was particularly informative as little has been known
about the importance of this region in ccRCC since the 5q gain was initially described. Focal
amplification also implicated the protein kinase C member, PRKCI5 and the MDS1 and
EVI1 complex locus MECOM at 3p26, the p53 regulator MDM4 at 1q32, MYC at 8q24 and
JAK2 on 9p24. Focally deleted regions included the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A at
9p21 and PTEN at 10q23, putative tumor suppressor genes NEGR1 at 1p31, QKI at 6q26,
and CADM2 at 3p12 and the genes that are frequently deleted in cancer, PTPRD at 9p23
and NRXN3 at 14q24.10

Whole exome sequencing (WES) of tumors from 417 patients identified 36,353 putative
somatic mutations, including 16,821 missense mutations, 6,383 silent mutations and 2,999
indels, with an average of 1.1 ± 0.5 non-silent mutations per megabase (Figures S23–S25).
Mutations from 50 genes with high apparent somatic mutation frequencies (Table S4) were
independently validated using alternative sequencing instrumentation (Figure S26). In
tumors from 22 patients, whole genome sequencing was also used to validate and calibrate
the WES data and confirmed 83% of the WES mutation-calls (Tables S5–S6). In line with
results of previous studies (Tables S7–S8), the validated mutation data identified nineteen
significantly mutated genes (SMGs) (q< 0.1), with VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, PTEN,
BAP1, MTOR and TP53 representing the eight most extreme members (q<0.00001) (Figure
1a). Eleven additional SMGs were of considerably lower significance (q < 0.1 – 0.5) but
included known cancer genes. Among all SMGs, only mutation of BAP1 correlated with
poor survival outcome (Figure S27). Approximately 20% of cases had none of the 19
recorded SMGs, although many contained rare mutations in other known oncogenes or
tumor suppressors, involving survival associations, illustrating the genetic complexity of
ccRCC8 (Figures S28–S30 and Table S9).
Eighty-four putative RNA fusions were identified in 416 ccRCC samples.11 Eleven of
thirteen predicted events (Figure 1c) were validated using targeted methods, consistent with
an 85% true-positive rate (Table S10 and Figures S31–S35). A recurrent SFPQ-TFE3 fusion
(previously linked to non-clear cell translocation-associated RCC12) was found in five
samples, all of which were VHL wildtype, indicating either that these tumors are a clear cell
variant or that translocation-associated renal tumors may be histologically indistinguishable
from conventional ccRCC. Furthermore, the TFE3 protein as well as an X(p11)
rearrangement was found in three of those samples, where there were available slides.

DNA Methylation Profiles
We observed epigenetic silencing of VHL in about 7% of ccRCC tumors, which was
mutually exclusive with mutation of VHL (Figure 1a), reflecting the central role of this locus
in ccRCC.13 An additional 289 genes displayed evidence of epigenetic silencing in at least
5% of tumors. The top-ranked gene by inverse correlation between gene expression and
DNA methylation was UQCRH, hypermethylated in 36% of the tumors. UQCRH has been
previously suggested to be a tumor suppressor14, but not linked to ccRCC. Interestingly,
increasing promoter hypermethylation frequency correlated with higher stage and grade
(Figure 2a, b).

Author Manuscript

We also evaluated the global consequences of mutation in specific epigenetic modifiers.
Mutations in SETD2, a non-redundant H3K36 methyltransferase, were associated with
increased loss of DNA methylation at non-promoter regions (Figures 2c, 2d). This discovery
is consistent with the emerging view that H3K36 trimethylation may be involved in the
maintenance of a heterochromatic state15, whereby DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A)
binds H3K36me3 and methylates nearby DNA.16 Thus, reductions of H3K36me3 through
SETD2 inactivation could lead indirectly to regional loss of DNA methylation.

RNA Expression
Unsupervised clustering methods identified four stable subsets in both mRNA (m1–m4) and
miRNA (mi1–mi4) expression datasets (Figures 3a, S36–S39). Supervised clustering
revealed the similarity of these new mRNA classes to the previously reported ccA and ccB
expression subtypes17, with cluster m1 corresponding to ccA and ccB divided between m2
and m3 (Table S11). Cluster m4 probably accounts for the roughly 15% of tumors
previously unclassified in the ccA/ccB classification scheme. Similarly, the survival
advantage previously observed for ccA cases was again identified for m1 tumors (Figure
3b).

Author Manuscript

The m1-subtype was characterized by gene sets associated with chromatin remodeling
processes and a higher frequency of PBRM1 mutations (39% in m1 vs 27% in others, p=
0.027). Deletion of CDKN2A (53% vs 26%; p< 0.0001) and mutations in PTEN (11% vs
1%; p< 0.0001) were more frequent in m3 tumors (Figure S5). The m4 group displayed
higher frequencies of BAP1 mutations (17% vs 7%; p=0.002) and base excision repair;
however, this group also harbored more mTOR mutations (12% vs 4%; p=0.01) and
ribosomal gene sets.
Survival differences evident in miRNA-based subtypes (Figures S40–S44) correlated with
the mRNA data (Figures 3b–d). For example, miR-21, previously shown to demonstrate
strong regulatory interactions in ccRCC18 and with established roles in metabolism15,19,20
correlated strongly with worse outcome, and DNA promoter methylation levels inversely
correlated with expression of miR-21, miR-10b, and miR-30a (Table S12–S14). miRNA
interactions thus represent a significant component of the epigenetic regulation observed in
ccRCC.

Author Manuscript

Integrative data analyses
We used a combination of approaches for integrative pathway analysis. The HotNet21
algorithm employs a heat diffusion model, to find subnetworks distinguished by both the
frequency of mutation in genes (nodes in the network) and the topology of interactions
between genes (edges in the network). In ccRCC, Hotnet identified twenty-five subnetworks
of genes within a genome-scale protein-protein interaction network (Table S15 and Figure
S45). The largest and most frequently mutated network contained VHL and interacting
partners. The second most frequently mutated subnetwork included PBRM1, ARID1A and
SMARCA4, key genes in the PBAF SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex.

Author Manuscript

We also inferred activities for known pathways, by using the PARADIGM algorithm to
incorporate mutation, copy, and mRNA expression data, with pathway information
catalogued in public databases. This method identified a highly significant subnetwork of
2,398 known regulatory interactions, connecting 1,218 molecular features (645 distinct
proteins) (Figures S46–S49, Tables S16–S17). Several “active” transcriptional “hubs” were
identified, by searching for transcription factors with targets that were inferred to be active
in the PARADIGM network. The active hubs found included HIF/ARNT, the transcription
factor program activated by VHL mutation, as well as MYC/Max, SP1, FOXM1, JUN, and
FOS. Together, these hubs and several less well-studied transcription factors, interlink much

of the transcriptional program promoting glycolytic shift, de-differentiation, and growth
promotion in ccRCC.

Author Manuscript

We next searched for causal regulatory interactions connecting ccRCC somatic mutations to
these transcriptional hubs, using a bi-directional extension to HotNet (‘TieDIE’) and
identified a chromatin-specific sub-network (Figures 4a, S50–S52). TieDIE defines a set of
transcriptional targets, whose state in the tumor cells is hypothesized to be influenced by one
or more of the significantly mutated genes. The chromatin modification pathway intersects a
wide variety of processes, including the regulation of hormone receptors (e.g. ESR1), RAS
signaling via the SRC homolog (SHC1), immune-related signaling (e.g. NFκB1 and IL6)26,
transcriptional output (e.g. HIF1A, JUN, FOS, and SP1), BRCA1 function (via BAP1) and
Beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and TGF-beta (TGFBR2) signaling via interactions with a SMARCPBRM1-ARID1A complex. The complexity of these interactions reflects the potential for
highly pleiotrophic effects following primary events in chromatin modification genes.
The mutations in the chromatin regulators PBRM1, BAP1, and SETD2 were differentially
associated with altered expression patterns of large numbers of genes when compared to
samples bearing a background of VHL mutation (Table S18–S21, Figure S53). Each
chromatin regulator had a distinct set of downstream effects, reflecting diverse roles for
chromatin remodeling in the transcriptome.

Author Manuscript

Additionally, an unsupervised pathway analysis using the MEMo algorithm22, identified
mutually exclusive patterns of alterations targeting multiple components of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway in 28% of the tumors (Figures 4b, Table S22). Interestingly, the altered
gene module included two genes from the broad amplicon on 5q35.3: GNB2L1/RACK1 and
SQSTM1/p62. Both these genes have previously been associated with activation of PI3K
signaling23,24. Furthermore, mRNA expression levels of these two genes were correlated
with both DNA copy number level increases and alteration status of the PI3K pathway
(Figures S54–S55). The mutual exclusivity module also includes frequent over-expression
of EGFR, which correlates with increased phosphorylation of the receptor (Figure S56), and
which has been previously associated with Lapatinib response in ccRCC25.

Correlations with survival

Author Manuscript

Where unsupervised analyses had indicated that common molecular patterns were associated
with patient survival, we sought to further define molecular prognostic signatures at the
levels of mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, and protein. Data were divided into
‘discovery’ (N=193) and ‘validation’ (N=253) sets and platform-specific signatures were
defined using Cox analyses26. Kaplan-Meier analysis for each signature showed statistically
significant associations with survival in the validation subset (Figures 5a and S57).
Multivariate Cox analyses, incorporating established clinical variables, showed that the
mRNA, miRNA, and protein signatures provided additional prognostic power (Table S23).
In addition, these signatures could provide molecular clues as to the drivers of aggressive
cancers.
Top protein correlates of worse survival included reduced AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)
and increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (Figure S58). Together, down-regulation of

AMPK and up-regulation of ACC activity contribute to a metabolic shift towards increased
fatty acid synthesis.27 A metabolic shift to an altered use of key metabolites and pathways
was also apparent when considering the full set of genes involved in the core metabolic
processes, including a shift towards a “Warburg effect”-like state (Figure 5b). Poor
prognosis correlated with down-regulation of AMPK complex and the Krebs cycle genes,
and with up-regulation of genes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (G6PD, PGLS,
TALDO, TKT) and fatty acid synthesis (FASN, ACC).

Author Manuscript

Examination of potential genetic or epigenetic drivers of a glycolytic shift led us to identify
methylation events involving miR-21 and GRB10, with decreased promoter methylation of
each gene (thereby higher expression) being associated with worse or better outcome,
respectively (Figure 5B, Figure S59, Table S24). Both genes regulate the PI3K pathway:
miR-21 is inducible by high glucose levels and down-regulates PTEN20; while the tumor
suppressor Grb10 negatively regulates PI3K and insulin signaling.28 Promoter methylation
of miR-21 and GRB10 were coordinated with their mRNA expression patterns, as well as
with the mRNA expression of other key genes and protein expression in the metabolic
pathways (Figures 5C and S60). In addition to the PI3K pathway (Figures 5B and S61),
molecular survival correlations involved several pro-metastatic matrix metalloproteinases
(Figure S62).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Our study sampled a single site of the primary tumor, in a disease with a potentially high
level of tumor heterogeneity8. The extent to which convergent evolutionary events are a
common theme in ccRCC remains to be determined, but may indicate that critical genes will
be represented across the tumor landscape for an individual mass. In general, the large
sample size appeared to overcome the intrinsic challenges of studying a genetically complex
disease, revealing rare variants at rates similar to what has been described previously29. The
samples, taken from primary tumor specimens, were reflective of patients fit for either
definitive or cytoreductive nephrectomy, while future work could explore the genomic
landscape of metastatic lesions.

Author Manuscript

Pathway and integrated analyses highlighted the importance of the well-known VHL/HIF
pathway, the newly emerging chromatin remodeling/histone methylation pathway, and the
PI3K/AKT pathway. The observation of chromatin modifier genes being frequently mutated
in ccRCC strongly supports the model of nucleosome dynamics providing a key function in
renal tumorigenesis. Although the mechanistic details remain to be defined as to how such
modulation promotes tumor formation, the data presented here revealed alterations in DNA
methylation associated with SETD2 mutations. As an epigenetic process that can potently
alter many transcriptional outputs, these mutational events have the potential to alter the
landscape of the tumor genome via altered expression of global sets of genes and genetic
elements. Molecular correlates of patient survival further implicated PI3K/AKT as having a
role in tumor progression, involving specific DNA methylation events. The PI3K/AKT
pathway presents a strong therapeutic target in ccRCC, supporting the potential value of
MTOR and/or related pathway inhibitor drugs for this cancer.30,31

Cross-platform molecular analyses indicated a correlation between worsened prognosis in
patients with ccRCC and a metabolic shift involving increased dependence on the pentose
phosphate shunt, decreased AMPK, decreased Krebs cycle activity, increased glutamine
transport and fatty acid production. These findings are consistent with the isotopomer
spectral analysis of a pair of VHL −/− clear cell kidney cancer cell lines, both of which were
notably derived from patients with aggressive, metastatic disease, which revealed a
dependence on reductive glutamine metabolism for lipid biosynthesis.32 The metabolic shift
identified in poor prognosis ccRCC remarkably mirrors the Warburg metabolic phenotype
(increased glycolysis, decreased AMPK, glutamine dependent lipogenesis) identified in type
2 papillary kidney cancer characterized by mutation of the Krebs cycle enzyme, fumarate
hydratase.32 Further studies to dissect out the role of the commonly mutated chromosome 3
chromatin remodeling genes, PBRM1, SETD2 and BAP1, in ccRCC tumorigenesis and their
potential role in the metabolic remodeling associated with progression of this disease will
hopefully provide the foundation for the development of effective forms of therapy for this
disease.

Methods Summary
Specimens were obtained from patients, with appropriate consent from institutional review
boards. Using a co-isolation protocol, DNA and RNA were purified. In total, 446 patients
were assayed on at least one molecular profiling platform, which platforms included: (1)
RNA sequencing; (2) DNA methylation arrays; (3) miRNA sequencing; (4) Affymetrix SNP
arrays; (5) exome sequencing; and (6) reverse phase protein arrays. As described above and
in the Supplemental Methods, both single platform analyses and integrated cross-platform

Figure Two. DNA methylation and ccRCC

Author Manuscript

(a–b) Overall promoter DNA hypermethylation frequency in the tumor increases with rising
stage (a) and grade (b). The promoter DNA hypermethylation frequency is calculated as the
percentage of CpG loci hypermethylated among 15,101 loci which are unmethylated in the
normal kidney tissue and normal white blood cells (boxplots, median with 95% confidence
interval). (c) Volcano plots showing a comparison of DNA methylation for SETD2 mutant
versus non-mutant tumors (n=224, Human Methylation 450 platform). Unshaded area: CpG
loci with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR=0.001 and difference in mean beta value >0.1
(n=2,557). (d) Heatmap showing CpG loci with SETD2 mutation-associated DNA
methylation (from part c); blue to red indicates low to high DNA methylation. The loci are
split into those hypomethylated (top panel; n=1,251) or hypermethylated (bottom panel;
n=1,306) in SETD2 mutants. Top color bars indicate SETD2 mRNA expression (red: high,
green: low) and SETD2 mutation status. Gray-scale row-side color bar on left-hand side
represents the relative number of overlapping reads, based on H3K36me3 ChIP-seq
experiment in normal adult kidney (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/epigenomics/); black, high
read count. DNA methylation patterns include 14 normal kidney samples. Among the
tumors without SETD2 mutations, six (arrowhead) have both the signature pattern of SETD2
mutation and low SETD2 mRNA expression.

Figure Three. mRNA and miRNA patterns reflect molecular subtypes of ccRCC

Author Manuscript

(a) By unsupervised analyses, tumors separated into four sample groups (i.e. “clusters”),
based on either differentially expressed mRNA patterns (left panel, showing 500
representative genes: m1–4) or differentially expressed miRNA patterns (right panel,
showing 26 representative miRNAs: mi1–4). (b) Significant differences in patient survival
were identified among either the mRNA-based clusters (left panel) or the miRNA-based
clusters (right panel). (c) Numbers of samples overlapping between the two sets of clusters,
with significant concordance observed between m1 and mi3 and between m3 and mi2; Red,
significant overlap (P<1E-5, chi-squared test). (d) mRNA-miRNA correlations, for
predicted targeting interactions. Rows indicate miRNAs from part a (indicated by cluster
specific color bar); columns, mRNAs (5000 differentially regulated genes selected for
average RPKM>10 and at least one predicted miRNA interaction); mRNA-miRNA entries
with no predicted targeting show as white. To the right of the correlation matrix, t-statistics
(Spearman’s rank) indicate group target enrichment.

(a) Alterations in chromatin remodeling genes were predicted to impact a large network of
genes and pathways (larger implicated network in supplemental). Each gene is depicted as a
multi-ring circle with various levels of data, plotted such that each ‘spoke’ in the ring
represents a single patient sample (same sample ordering for all genes). ‘PARADIGM’ ring,
bioinformatically inferred levels of gene activity (red, higher activity); ‘Expression’, mRNA
levels relative to normal (red, high); ‘Mutation’, somatic event; center, correlation of gene
expression or activity to mutation events in chromatin-related genes (red, positive). Proteinprotein relationships inferred using public resources. (b) For the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway

(altered in ~28% of tumors), the MEMo algorithm identified a pattern of mutually exclusive
gene alterations (somatic mutations, copy alterations, and aberrant mRNA expression)
targeting multiple components, including 2 genes from the recurrent amplicon on 5q35.3.
The alteration frequency and inferred alteration type (blue for inactivation, and red for
activation) is shown for each gene in the pathway diagram.

Figure Five. Molecular correlates of patient survival involve metabolic pathways

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

(a) Sample profiles were separated into discovery and validation subsets, with the top
survival correlates within the discovery subset being defined for each of the four platforms
examined (mRNA, microRNA, protein, DNA methylation). Kaplan-Meier plots show results
of applying the four prognostic signatures to the validation subset, comparing survival for
patients with predicted higher risk (red, top third of signature scores), lower risk (blue,
bottom third), or intermediate risk (gray, middle third); successful predictions were observed
in each case. (b) When viewed in the context of metabolism, the molecular survival
correlates highlight a widespread metabolic shift, with tumors altering their usage of key
pathways and metabolites (red and blue shading representing the correlation of increased
gene expression with worse or better survival respectively, univariate Cox based on
extended cohort). Worse survival correlates with up-regulation of pentose phosphate
pathway genes (G6PH, PGLS, TALDO and TKT), fatty acid synthesis genes (ACC and
FASN), and PI3K pathway enhancing genes (miR-21). Better survival correlates with upregulation of AMPK complex genes, multiple Krebs cycle genes, and PI3K pathway
inhibitors (PTEN, TSC2). Additionally, specific promoter methylation events, including
hypermethylation of PI3K pathway repressor GRB10, associate with outcome. (c) Heat map
of selected key features from the metabolic shift schematic (b) demonstrating coordinate
expression by stage at DNA methylation, RNA, and protein levels (data from validation
subset).
