ABSTRACT
G9a, a histone methyltransferase, is aberrantly expressed in some human tumor
types. By comparing 182 paired colorectal cancer and peritumoral tissues, we found
that G9a was highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC). Overexpression of G9a
promoted CRC cells proliferation and colony formation, whereas knockdown of G9a
inhibited CRC cells proliferation. Depletion of G9a increased the rate of chromosome
aberration, induced DNA double strand breaks and CRC cells senescence. G9a
inhibition synergistically increased γH2AX expression induced by topoisomerase I
inhibitors and ultimately led to CRC cell death. The findings that down-regulation of
G9a triggers DNA damage response and inhibits colorectal cancer cells proliferation
may define G9a as potential oncotarget in CRC.

as diagnostic and prognostic molecular markers, as well as
novel therapeutic targets.
G9a, which is also known as EHMT2/KMT1C,
is a histone methyltransferase (HMT) that contains a
Su(var), Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax (SET) domain, and
localizes in euchromatin regions where it catalyzes the
mono- and di-methylation of histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9me1/
H3K9me2) [10]. In addition to histone modifications,
some non-histone G9a substrates such as p53 [11] have
been identified. Evidence suggests that G9a is required
for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype.
Dysregulated expression of G9a was documented in
different tumor types, including lung cancer, breast
cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma [12–14]. However,
the tumorigenic role of G9a in colon cancer is far from
clear. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether
G9a plays an important role in the development of CRC.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths
worldwide [1, 2]. The World Cancer Research Fund
International estimates that nearly 1.4 million new cases
of CRC were clinically diagnosed worldwide in 2012,
with 102,480 new cases in the United States [3]. Currently,
the main treatment for CRC is surgery, radiotherapy,
and chemotherapy. However, the 5-year survival rate is
less than 40% in less developed countries [4]. Following
chemotherapy, more than 50% of patients relapse, and this
is associated with metastasis [5]. Advanced stage colorectal
tumors are notoriously resistant to chemotherapy and
show a very poor 5-year survival [6, 7]. For these reasons,
research into the mechanisms behind CRC development is
imperative for the identification of novel therapeutic targets.
CRC has been depicted for many years as a
prototypic model for the genetic basis of cancer, and is
now becoming increasingly cited as an epigenetic model
for tumorigenesis. In fact, epigenetic alterations, including
DNA methylation and histone modification, are much
more prevalent than genetic alterations in the development
of CRC [4, 8, 9]. These epigenetic changes that lead to
heritable changes in gene expression are now widely used

RESULTS
G9a is highly expressed in CRC patient samples
To elucidate a link between G9a expression and
CRC, immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze
G9a levels in normal and tumor tissues. In all CRC patient

in vitro (Figure 3A, 3B). To further substantiate these
observations, the G9a specific inhibitors, UNC0638
and BIX01294 were used. These inhibitors significantly
reduced CRC cell proliferation, with the IC50 values
ranging from 1–20 μM (Figure 2D). Our data together
suggest that G9a plays a critical role in CRC cell
proliferation.
To assess the effect of G9a expression on cell
proliferation in vivo, CRC cells with different levels of
G9a were subcutaneously inoculated in nude mice. All
mice developed palpable cancers within 30 days after
inoculation, however silencing G9a impaired tumor
growth. As shown in Figure 2E, knockdown of G9a
expression with shG9a2 most proficiently attenuated
HT29 cell growth in nude mice in comparison to the
shCon, shG9a1, and shG9a3 groups, with tumor
volumes of 266 ± 102 mm3, 1678 ± 593 mm3, 701 ±
331 mm3, and 930 ± 194 mm3, respectively on the 32nd
day. Alternatively, the tumor volume in the HT29pLEXhG9a group was statistically larger than that in
HT29-pLEXmock, with the tumor volume of the former
being 1578 ± 100 mm3, while the latter tumor volume
was 978 ± 132 mm3 on the 21st day (Figure 3C). All
these strongly suggest that G9a can regulate the tumor
growth of CRC.

tissues, G9a staining was observed mainly in the cell
nucleus, with cytoplasmic staining in few specimens.
Examination of 182 paired CRC specimens revealed a
significantly higher expression of G9a in tumor tissues
(P < 0.0001; Figure 1A, 1B). We also used a panel of
CRC cell lines to profile the expression pattern of G9a.
Western blot analysis showed that G9a was expressed
in all CRC cell lines tested (Figure 1C). Our data
collectively demonstrated that G9a is highly expressed
in both clinical samples and CRC cell lines, suggesting
a potential role of G9a in maintaining the malignant
phenotype of CRC.

G9a is important for colon cancer cell
proliferation in vitro and in vivo
In order to explore the role of G9a in colorectal
cancer development, specific siRNAs were used to
knockdown G9a expression in HT29, SW620, KM12,
SW480, and HCT15 CRC cell lines. siRNA transfection
successfully reduced G9a expression, and consequently
suppressed H3K9me2 in all CRC cell lines, whereas
no difference in GLP expression was observed. The
knockdown of G9a drastically reduced cell growth in
vitro (Figure 2A). To further assess the effects of G9a
expression on cell growth, stable cell lines were generated
with limited G9a expression (shG9a1, shG9a2, shG9a3
in HT29, and shG9a1, shG9a2 in SW620) (Figure 2B)
and abundant G9a expression (pLEX-hG9a transfected
in HT29 and SW620) (Figure 3A). As compared with
the parent cells, the cells that stably suppressed G9a
expression grew more slowly (Figure 2B), and possessed
a reduced capacity for colony formation (Figure 2C). In
contrast, overexpression of G9a promoted CRC growth

Down-regulation of G9a induces DNA damage
response in colon cancer
It has been reported that down-regulation of
G9a can induce chromosome instability in cancer cells
[15]. By means of karyotype analysis, we found that
knockdown of G9a increased the rate of chromosome
aberration from 0.55% to 5% in HT29shG9a cells, as

compared with cells transfected with shCon (Figure 4A).
Given that chromosome instability leads to DNA damage
[16], we used a neutral comet assay, a simple, sensitive
and rapid method for the detection and quantification of
DNA damage [17], to evaluate whether G9a depletion
induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In Figure
4B, the degree of cellular DNA DSBs increased after G9a
knockdown in HT29 and SW620 cells, as evidenced by the
frequent appearance and expanding volume of comet tails,
as well as the shrinkage of comet heads. Furthermore, we
found an increased expression of phosphorylated H2AX
(γH2AX), which is a well-known marker of DNA DSBs.
Since γH2AX is known to be phosphorylated by
members of phosphoinositide 3-kinase related protein
kinases (PIKKs) such as ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mutated), ATR (ATM and Rad-related kinase), or DNAdependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs)
in response to genomic insult [18], we further investigated
the potential effect of G9a on these upstream signaling
molecules. We found that levels of p-ATM (Ser 1981),
p-ATR (Ser 428), ATM, p-Chk1 (Ser 317), and p-Chk2
(Thr 68) increased in G9a-knockdown HT29 and SW620
cell lines as compared to cells transfected with shCon
(Figure 4C, Figure S1). Similar results were observed
in the in vivo studies. We found that Ki67, a hallmark
of proliferation, decreased in G9a-knockdown HT29
xenografts, followed by an increased level of γH2AX
(Figure 4D, 4E). These studies indicate that suppression of
G9a expression triggers DSBs and a robust DNA-damage
response in colon cancer.

Silencing G9a leads to cancer cell senescence

[21, 22]. In this regard, we investigated whether G9a
knockdown may induce senescence of CRC cells. Since
SA-β-gal (senescence-associated β-galactosidase) has
been identified as a specific marker for senescent cells
[23], HT29 and SW620 cells were then stained with
β-galactosidase to determine whether senescence was
initiated by G9a depletion-induced DNA damage response
(DDR). We found a significant increase of β-galactosidase

DNA damage often leads to a halt in cell prolife­
ration by triggering apoptosis or senescence, which
thereby prevents transmission of harmful mutations
onto daughter cells [19, 20]. And γ-H2AX is not only
a marker of DNA damage but also a marker of cellular
senescence even in the absence of DNA damage

positive cells when G9a was suppressed in the CRC cell
lines (Figure 5A). Moreover, p21, which is considered an
inducer of cellular senescence, was up-regulated in these
cell lines (Figure 5B). These findings were consistent
with those observed in HT29 xenograft tumors that had
G9a stably suppressed (Figure 5C). However, knockdown
of G9a failed to induce apoptosis, as evidenced by the
consistent annexin V+ levels in HT29shG9a cells and
SW620shG9a cells (Figure 5D), when compared with
shCon cells.

on the Chou-Talalay method [24]. A CI < 1 indicates a
synergistic effect, CI = 1 indicates an additive effect,
whereas CI > 1 indicates an antagonistic effect. Our data
shows that the TOPO I inhibitors and the G9a inhibitor
UNC0638 displayed a synergistic effect in a panel of
CRC cell lines, including HT29, SW620, HCT-15,
Colo-205, KM12, and LoVo (Figure 6B, 6C). Western
blot and immunofluorescence analysis further revealed
that either UN0638 or TOPO I inhibitors alone weakly
increased the accumulation of γH2AX in vitro. However,
the combined therapy resulted in a dramatic increase in
γH2AX accumulation (Figure 6D, 6E). Consistent with
this, increased phosphorylation of p-Chk1 and p-Chk2 was
also observed (Figure 6E).
In addition to the above experiments, the 293T cell
line was used to generate three stable cell lines: mock
(pLEX-Mock), high expression of G9a (pLEX-hG9a),
and non-activated mutant-dead G9a (pLEX-ΔSET-hG9a)
(Figure S2). We found that p-Chk1 (Ser 317), p-Chk2
(Thr 68), and γ-H2AX levels quickly increased in mock
and pLEX-ΔSET-hG9a 293T cells in response to CPT
treatment. However, no alteration in p-Chk1 (Ser 317),
p-Chk2 (Thr 68), and γ-H2AX were observed with CPT
treatment of the pLEX-hG9a cell line (Figure 6F). This
suggests that G9a depletion-synergized DNA damage
depends on its catalytic activity. Taken together, these

G9a depletion synergizes with topoisomerase I
(TOPO I) inhibitors in CRC cells
Combinatorial drug treatment is widely used in
cancer therapeutics to combat single-drug resistance,
overcome side effects, and increase sensitivity to therapy.
Since TOPO I inhibitors are widely used to treat CRC, we
investigated whether G9a would potentiate the anticancer
activity induced by TOPO I inhibitors. For this, we used
two TOPO I inhibitors SN-38 and CPT as combinatorial
components. We found that the IC50s for SN-38 and
CPT were lower in G9a knockdown cells, as compared
with parent cells (Figure 6A). We next determined the
combination therapy effect by calculating the combination
index (CI) using the CalcuSyn program, which is based

results indicate that G9a depletion synergizes with the
antitumor activity of topoisomerase inhibitors in colon
cancer treatment.

G9a depletion potentiated the SN-38-induced cytotoxicity
in CRC cells. Furthermore, the combined therapy
synergistically increased γH2AX, caused DNA damage,
and led to CRC cell senescence.
In summary, the results obtained in this study
indicate that G9a inhibition may be a promising
therapeutic target in the treatment of CRC, especially
when G9a inhibitors are combined with other cytotoxic
agents that have a synergistic effect.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we identified for the first
time that over-expression of G9a stimulated CRC cell
proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, G9aspecific siRNAs, G9a stable knockdown, and G9a specific
inhibitors inhibit CRC cell proliferation. Mechanistically,
the tumor-promoting effect of G9a appears to bypass
its known downstream signaling molecules such as
EpCAM [25], PPARγ [26], and Wnt [26, 27] (Figure S3).
Instead, G9a depletion increased the rate of chromosome
aberration, induced DNA DSBs, and ultimately led to
CRC tumor growth arrest. A remarkable increase in
γH2AX levels in G9a-knockdown CRC cells was also
displayed, followed by the accumulation of p-ATM and
p-ATR, which is preferentially activated by DSBs. HMTs’
abnormality associated with DDR has been reported
these years [28, 29]. Dot1L, which is the only non-SET
domain-containing HMT that targets histone H3 lysine
79 (H3K79), can recruit DNA repair component 53BP1
to the sites of damage [30, 31]. EZH2 depletion results
in the abrogation of cell cycle G1 and G2/M checkpoints,
directing DNA damage response toward predominant
apoptosis in both p53-proficient and p53-deficient cancer
cells, but not in normal cells [32]. Study of G9a knockout
mice showed that G9a was necessary for embryonic
development and cell differentiation. It is believed that
this embryonic growth defect in G9a-deficient embryonic
stem cells may be due to apoptotic cell death but not cell
cycle arrest. In that model, chromosomal instability was
not observed in the knockout cells [33]. However, it has
been reported that an increased number of chromosomes
was found in the G9a-knockdown MCF-7 and H1299 cells
[13]. The present study provided insight into the possible
benefits of down-regulating G9a in colon cancer, with G9a
knockdown inducing extensive chromosome instability,
which could trigger DNA damage response, cellular
senescence, and ultimately tumor growth arrest.
Tumor recurrence following surgery and adjuvant
treatment remains a major problem in CRC treatment.
Irinotecan (CPT-11) is often used as a first- and secondline chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent CRC.
However, only 20–30% of patients show an objective
response to CPT-11. There is increasing awareness of an
improved outcome in clinical practice when epigenetic
inhibitors and cytotoxic agents are combined [34].
Therefore, we also tried to evaluate a combination therapy
of G9a inhibitor and TOPO I inhibitors in CRC treatment.
As expected, a synergistic anticancer effect of UNC0638
with TOPO I inhibitors were observed in CRC cells. CI
values and the significant decline in the colony numbers
when the drugs were combined strongly demonstrated that

Immunohistochemistry
CRC tissue was provided by Shanghai Biochip
Company Ltd. The sections consisted of 182 pairs of tumor
and matched peritumoral samples. Immunohistochemistry
was performed as described previously [35]. Briefly, the
EnVision™ Detection Systems Peroxidase/DAB detection
kit was used in this experiment. The primary antibody
was diluted at 1:1000 and incubated at 4°C overnight. The
slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and the tissue
image was captured with a digital camera and quantitated
by Image Pro Plus.

Cell culture
The human colon adenocarcinoma HT29, SW620,
SW480, HCT15, LoVo, 293T, and 293FT cell lines
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA). KM12 was from Japan and Colo205 was from Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and
Cell Biology. HT29 and HCT116 cells were grown in
McCoy’s 5A medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Grand Island, NY).
SW620 and SW480 cells were grown in L-15 (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS. HCT15
and Colo-205 were grown in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Grand

Island, NY) supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose, 0.11 g/L
sodium pyruvate, and 10% FBS. LoVo was grown in F-12
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 0.29 g/L
glutamine and 10% FBS. KM12 was grown in RPMI-1640
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS.
The 293FT Lentiviral Expression System and 293T were
cultured in Delbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS.

with distilled water, and stained with SRB (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) in 1% acetic acid. SRB in the cells
was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl and was measured
at 560 nm with a spectraMAX190 (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA).

Western blot analyses
Cells were collected and lysed in RIPA (Beyotime,
Nan-tong, China) supplemented with a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). An equal amount
of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with primary
antibodies at 4°C overnight. Protein levels were quantified
using Image J.

Plasmids and transfection
pLKO.1-shG9a plasmids were generous gifts from
Dr. Jin Jian (University of North Carolina, USA). pEGFPhG9a, pEGFP-ΔSET-hG9a [36] were obtained from
Addgene, and recombined into pLEX to construct pLEXhG9a, and pLEX-ΔSET-hG9a. These plasmids were
transfected into 293FT cells with packaging mix (pCMVdR8.2 dvpr and pCMV-VSVG) to produce lentiviruses.
The stable knockdown and overexpressed G9a cell lines
were established as outlined in the Addgene protocols.

Comet assay [35]
Slides were pre-coated with 1% normal melting
point agarose. About 3 × 104 cells were mixed with 70 μL
of 1% low melting point agarose in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and rapidly spread onto the pre-coated
slides. The slides were immediately placed in cold lysis
buffer containing 2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM
Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 1% INCI, and 10%
DMSO at 4°C for 1–3 h. The slides were then placed in
the electrophoresis solution for 20 min to facilitate DNA
unwinding before electrophoresis was conducted for 20
min at 25 V and 300 mA. After electrophoresis, the slides
were washed with PBS and then stained with DAPI. The
individual cells were viewed using an Olympus BX51 UV
fluorescence microscope(Olympus, Japan).

Quantitative real time RT-PCR
Total cellular RNA was isolated with TRIzol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse
transcribed into cDNA using the PrimeScript™ RT
reagent Kit (Takara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan). Real-time
RT-PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems
7500 using SYBR-Green Master mix (Takara) with the
following primers: G9a 5′- gccaggccgggaggccctggaa-3′
(sense), 5′- ctccagcctgcagcagcacatg-3′ (antisense);
GLP 5′- gccgtggacagcgagccatgcccc-3′ (sense), 5′ggcaggagccggccatccttgtcgt-3′ (antisense), and GAPDH 5′gcaaattccatggcaccgtc-3′ (sense), 5′- tcgccccacttgattttg-3′
(antisense) . The reactions parameters were: 95°C for 10 min
followed by 42 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 34 s.
All samples including the template controls were assayed
in triplicate. The relative number of target transcripts was
normalized to the number of human GAPDH transcripts
found in the same sample. The relative quantification of
target gene expression was performed with the standard
curve or comparative cycle threshold (CT) method.

Karyotype analysis
Colcemid (final concentration 0.1 μg/mL) was added
to culture flasks and incubated at 37°C for 4 h, before
cells were trypsinized, collected and centrifuged at 1000
rpm for 6 min. The cell pellet was resuspended gently in
hypotonic solution (0.4% KCl:0.4% sodium citrate) to a
final volume of 4 mL. The cell suspension was incubated
at 37°C for 7 min to swell the cells. This suspension was
then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 6 min. The supernatant
was then carefully removed and the remaining cell pellet
was fixed in 2 mL of fresh fixative (3:1 v/v methanol
and acetic acid) at room temperature for 30 min. Fixed
cells were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 6 min, and
the fixing procedure was repeated three times. Following
the last centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in
1 mL fixative. A portion of this cell suspension was then
placed on a glass slide and stained with Giemsa for ~15
min. More than 100 chromosomes were observed, and
the aberrant chromosomes (e.g., visible breaks, dicentric
chromosomes, fragmentations, chromosome loss, ring
formation, triradial chromosomes, and gaps) were counted.
This data was then used to determine the ratio of aberrant
chromosomes.

Colony formation assay
SW620 and HT29 stable knockdown or overexpressed
cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates at the density of
200 cells per well. The cells were cultured for 10–15 days
until colonies were visible. Colonies were fixed in 10%
formaldehyde and 10% acetic acid at room temperature for
10 min and then stained with 1% crystal violet.

Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay
Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates with the same
density, and cultured for 1 d, 3 d, 5 d, and 7 d. Cells were
then fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), washed

Animal studies
Athymic BALB/c 4–6 weeks old nude mice,
purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd (Beijing,
China), were housed in a specific pathogen-free room with
a 12 h light/dark cycle at 25 ± 1°C and fed an autoclaved
chow diet and water ad libitum. All experiments were
performed according to the institutional ethical guidelines
on animal care and approved by the Institute Animal Care
and Use Committee at Shanghai Institute of Materia
Medica. HT29 and SW620 cells were s.c. injected into the
right flank of nude mice at 5 × 106 cells/mouse (six mice
per group). Tumor diameters were measured two times per
week and tumor volumes (V) calculated using ½ × length
× width2.
