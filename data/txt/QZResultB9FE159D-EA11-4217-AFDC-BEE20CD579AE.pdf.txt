Abstract
Xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA)–binding protein 2
(XAB2) is composed of 855 amino acids, contains 15
tetratricopeptide repeat motifs, and associates with Cockayne
syndrome group A and B proteins and RNA polymerase II, as
well as XPA. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that XAB2 is
involved in pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, and transcription-coupled DNA repair, leading to preimplantation lethality,
and is essential for mouse embryogenesis. Retinoids are
effective for the treatment of preneoplastic diseases including
xeroderma pigmentosum and other dermatologic diseases
such as photoaging. We therefore focused on defining the
effect of XAB2 on cellular differentiation in the presence
of ATRA treatment. In the present study, we showed that
overexpression of XAB2 inhibited ATRA-induced cellular
differentiation in human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, and
that knockdown of XAB2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
increased ATRA-sensitive cellular differentiation in the human
promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 at both physiologic
(10 9–10 8 mol/L) and therapeutic (10 7 mol/L) concentrations of ATRA. Moreover, we found that XAB2 was associated
with retinoic acid receptor A (RARA) and histone deacetylase
3 in the nuclei. Finally, using siRNA against XAB2, we showed
that the ATRA-resistant neuroblastoma cell line IMR-32
underwent cellular differentiation induced by ATRA at a
therapeutic concentration (10 6 mol/L). These results strongly
suggest that XAB2 is a component of the RAR corepressor
complex with an inhibitory effect on ATRA-induced cellular
differentiation and that XAB2 plays a role in ATRA-mediated
cellular differentiation as an important aspect of cancer
therapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1019–29]

lignant, and malignant cells (1, 2). These findings provided a
basis for the use of retinoic acid in clinical cancer therapy and
chemoprevention as differentiation therapy (3–6). For instance,
all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has dramatically changed the clinical
outcome of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia from
one that was highly lethal to one that now seems to be highly
curable (7, 8). Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by a
chromosomal translocation, t(15;17), resulting in the fusion
product PML-RARa (promyelocytic leukemia gene on chromosome
15 and retinoic acid receptor a gene on chromosome 17; refs. 9–11).
The PML-RARa protein is stably associated with histone deacetylase (HDAC)–containing corepressor complexes, which leads to
transcriptional repression of the program required for granulocytic
differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia blasts at physiologic levels of retinoic acid (10 8 mol/L; refs. 12–14). At therapeutic
concentrations (10 6 mol/L), retinoic acid dissociates the corepressor complex and recruits coactivator complexes, restoring the
regulation of target genes (8, 11, 15).
Through metabolites such as ATRA, retinoids exert their effect
on gene transcription mediated by the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)
or retinoid X receptor (RXR) via the binding of RAR-RXR
heterodimers or RXR-RXR homodimers to retinoic acid response
elements (RARE; refs. 16–18). The ligand-dependent activation of
genes via RAR or RXR depends on cofactor complexes interacting
with RAR or RXR. In the absence of ATRA, RAR-RXR heterodimers
interact with nuclear corepressors, such as silencing mediator of
retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) and nuclear
receptor corepressor (N-CoR), which recruit HDACs to induce
chromatin modifications and transcriptional repression (18–20).
Binding of retinoic acid permits dissociation of the corepressor
complex and recruitment of coactivator complex, which in turn
recruits histone acetyltransferase, thus leading to a permissive
chromatin modification for opening promoter accessibility and
finally to transcriptional activity (21). N-CoR/SMRT recruits
HDAC3 to serve as effective corepressors of DNA-bound unliganded RAR-RXR (22, 23). Moreover, N-CoR and SMRT function not
merely as platforms for recruitment of HDAC3 but also directly
stimulate HDAC3 enzymatic activity (22, 24, 25). In acute
promyelocytic leukemia, it has been reported that the PML-derived
oligomerization domain of PML-RARa is essential for such
biological properties as enhanced binding of the corepressor
N-CoR/SMRT with HDAC and blocking myeloid cell differentiation
(26, 27). These molecular findings suggest that abnormal recruitment of HDACs by RAR complexes is a key pathogenic mechanism

in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and that the repressor complexes,
including HDACs itself, as well as RAR, are the molecular target of
retinoic acid in differentiation therapy (28–32).
Xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA)–binding protein 2
(XAB2), which we independently isolated under the name of
HDART7 by virtue of its sequence similarity to Drosophila CRN, is
composed of 855 amino acids. XAB2 contains 15 tetratricopeptide
repeat motifs and functions in a nucleotide excision repair complex
(33). Cloned by virtue of its ability to interact with XPA protein in
the yeast two-hybrid system, XAB2 thus derives its name as XPAbinding protein 2, and is found to form a complex with the
nucleotide excision repair machinery (33). XAB2 knockout mice
have been reported to show preimplantation lethality (34, 35).
Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare human hereditary disease
characterized by hypersensitivity to sunlight, a high incidence of
skin cancer in sun-exposed areas, and accelerated neurodegeneration (36, 37). Cells from xeroderma pigmentosum patients are
hypersensitive to killing by UV irradiation, with early development
of skin cancer being caused by defective DNA repair (38–41).
Preneoplastic diseases including xeroderma pigmentosum were
previously shown to be successfully treated with retinoids (1, 4).
Expanding on these observations, we focus in this article on the
role of XAB2 as a novel target for retinoic acid–based differentiation therapy for cancers, defining in particular the biological
and physiologic function of XAB2 in the RAR/HDAC3 complex.
We now show that XAB2 functions as a corepressor of the RAR/
HDAC3 complex, and that knockdown of XAB2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhances sensitivity to ATRA in the acute
promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 and the rhabdomyosarcoma
cell line MM-1-19P, as well as the ATRA-resistant neuroblastoma
cell line IMR-32.

Materials and Methods
Cells, antibodies, and reagents. HEK293T, HepG2, HL60, and MM-119-P were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life
Technologies), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin (Life
Technologies). MM-1-19-P human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, HL60
human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, and retinoic acid–resistant human
neuroblastoma cell line IMR-32 were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and
100 Ag/mL streptomycin, using Laminin six-well multiwell plates (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA): anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti–green
fluorescent protein (GFP) polyclonal antibody (pAb), antitubulin mAb, antiHDAC1 pAb, anti-HDAC3 pAb, anti-HDAC4 pAb, anti-HDAC6 pAb, anti-RARa
pAb, Texas red–conjugated antigoat immunoglobulin secondary antibody,
Texas red–conjugated antimouse immunoglobulin secondary antibody, and
FITC-conjugated antimouse immunoglobulin secondary antibody. Anti-XAB2
mAb was purchased from Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan); anti-XAB2 polyclonal
antibody was obtained from Mo Bi Tec (Goettingen, Germany); phycoerythrinconjugated CD11b and 7-amino-actinomycin D were obtained from BD
PharMingen (San Jose, CA); and anti–acetyl-histone H4 polyclonal antibody was
obtained from Upstate (Chicago, IL).

siRNA ss2, 5¶-GUAUUTAUUTGAUUAAATTdTdT-3¶). Moreover, control
siRNA was prepared to examine nonspecific effects of siRNA duplexes
(5¶-GAACACUACUUCGUUCAAAdTdT-3¶). These selected sequences also
were submitted to a BLAST search against the human genome sequence to
ensure that only one gene of the human genome was targeted. siRNAs were
purchased from Japan Bioservice (Saitama, Japan). siRNA duplex formation
(annealing) was done as previously described (42). A total of 60 pmol of
siRNA duplexes were transfected into 0.5  106 cells using Nucleofector
(Amaxa, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After 48 h of transfection, cells were
prepared for examination.
Cellular differentiation. MM-1-19-P cells (1  106/mL) were transfected
with 2 Ag of pcDNA3-XAB2 or pcDNA3 plasmids as mock control,
and pEGFP-C1 plasmid (0.4 Ag) was cotransfected for the identification of
transfected cells. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with 2 Amol/L
ATRA for an additional 24 h and were submitted to fluorescence
microscopy analysis. The effect of exogenous XAB2 on cells was observed
by morphologic analysis of cells through the use of phase-contrast
microscopy merged with green fluorescence of GFP. Myocytic differentiation of rhabdomyosarcoma cells was observed with phase-contrast
microscopy, with two pathologists identifying the morphologic changes to
myocytic differentiation. For quantification, the percentage of GFP-positive,
myocyte-differentiated cells among a total of 1,000 GFP-positive cells was
shown in the graph. All experiments were done in triplicate and the results
presented as means with SE.
After transfection of siRNA, IMR-32 cells (1  106/mL) were incubated in
the presence of 2 Amol/L ATRA for an additional 48 h. Neuroganglional
differentiation of neuroblastoma cells was observed as previously described
(43); cells with extending processes longer than twice the diameter of the
cell body were counted as being differentiated, with two pathologists
identifying the morphologic changes to formation of neurite-like outgrowth.
For quantification, the percentage of differentiated cells among 1,000 cells
was shown in the graph. All experiments were done in triplicate and the
results presented as means with SE.
Relative quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay. In experiments assessing expression of RARh and CYP26 mRNA, after HEK293T or
HL60 cells were treated as described above, total RNA was then extracted
and cDNA was produced as previously described (44). PCR primers for the
coding sequences of RARh and CYP26 were as follows: RARh, forward 5¶ATGTTTGACTGTATGGATGTT-3¶, reverse 5¶-CCCACTTCAAAGCACTTCTG3¶; CYP26, forward 5¶-GATGAAGCGCAGGAAATAC-3¶, reverse 5¶-ATGGCGATTCGGAACATGGAG-3¶. These primers were designed for the coding
sequences that are located on different exons to eliminate amplifying
genomic DNA contamination in the PCRs. The quantities of mRNA were
adjusted equally by using PCR of h-actin ( forward primer 5¶-CAAGAGATGGCCACGGCTGCT-3¶ and reverse primer 5¶-TCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCA-3¶ as the internal control).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was done using 1  106 of HL60 cells in the presence or
absence of 1 Amol/L ATRA for 72 h. Protein-DNA complexes were prepared
using EZ ChIP Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Kit (Upstate) according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. After washing and reverse cross-linking,
immunoprecipitated DNA was purified and PCR was done. The following
PCR primers were used to detect the immunoprecipitated promoter
DNA: RARh promoter, forward 5¶-CTCTGGCTGTCTGCTTTTGC-3¶, reverse
3¶-CAAAAAGCCTTCCGAATGC-3¶; CYP26 promoter, forward 5¶-TAAAGATTTTGGGCAGCG-3¶, reverse 5¶-CATCTGCAAGGTTTCCCCAA-3¶. The
PCR reactions were done as described above.
Coimmunoprecipitation assay. For coimmunoprecipitation assays
involving endogenous XAB2 and HDACs, nuclear extracts were prepared
from 1  107 HL60 cells as previously described (45). Nuclear extracts were
then isolated by centrifugation at 15,000  g for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation assays were done subsequently by incubating nuclear extracts with
2 Ag of control immunoglobulin and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham
Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) at 4jC for 1 h. After centrifugation, supernatants
were incubated with 2 Ag of anti-XAB2 mAb at 4jC for 1 h, followed by the
addition of protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h (45). Cell lysates and nuclear
extracts were prepared and coimmunoprecipitation assay, SDS-PAGE, and

Western blot analysis were conducted according to the methods described
elsewhere (44, 45).
Confocal laser microscopy. For fluorescence microscopy experiments,
HL60 cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of ATRA and
then attached to microslide glass (Matsunami Glass, Inc., Tokyo, Japan)
coated with poly-L-lysine and fixed with ice-cold acetone/methanol (1:1).
After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were blocked with mouse and goat
immunoglobulin isotypes, followed by incubation with anti-XAB2 mAb,
RARa pAb, or anti-HDAC3 pAb (each at a concentration of 10 Ag/mL), then
washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated antimouse immunoglobulin
and/or Texas red–conjugated antigoat immunoglobulin antibodies (each at
a concentration of 5 Ag/mL). Confocal microscopy was done as described
elsewhere (44, 45).
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. To examine the potential
effect of XAB2 on ATRA-mediated transcriptional activity, HepG2 cells were
transiently transfected with pRARE-chloramphenicol acetyltransfelase
(CAT), which is a RARE-containing RAR reporter plasmid, cloned in frame
with CAT under the control of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter. Cells
were seeded onto 35-mm-diameter dishes at a density of 1.75  105 per well
and incubated overnight in FCS-supplemented medium. The following day,
cells were transfected with pRARE-CAT (1 Ag), pSV-h-gal (0.5 Ag), and
pcDNA3-XAB2 (0.5 or 1.0 Ag), or pcDNA3 as mock control. The amount of
expression vector was adjusted to 1 Ag with pcDNA3 empty vector in each
transfection. Twenty-four hours later, culture medium was removed and
cells were washed thrice with serum-free MEM (Life Technologies), and
then treated with fresh medium containing 100 nmol/L ATRA. Cells were
harvested after 24 h and assayed for h-galactosidase and CAT activity
with the use of the h-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega,
Madison, WI) and CAT Enzyme Assay System (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. For transfection efficiency, CAT activity was
normalized to h-galactosidase activity. The CAT activity in control cells
treated with DMSO vehicle and a mock vector was set as equal to one and
all other values are expressed as fold induction. Data represent mean from
triplicate experiments F SE.
Statistics. Student’s t test was used to determine whether the difference
between control and experimental samples was significant (P < 0.05).

Results
Overexpression of XAB2 inhibits cellular differentiation and
transcriptional activation induced by ATRA. To determine an
effect of XAB2 on cellular differentiation, we first examined
whether cellular differentiation is induced by overexpression of
exogenous XAB2. For this purpose, we used the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line MM-1-19-P, which is mainly composed of
small polygonal cells and terminally differentiates to myotube-like
giant cells following treatment with ATRA (46). As shown in
Fig. 1A, MM-1-19-P cells transfected with mock vector differentiated to myotube-like giant cells following treatment with ATRA
(arrowheads in a). On the other hand, ATRA did not induce any
morphologic changes in MM-1-19-P cells transfected with XAB2
expression plasmid (Fig. 1A, b). For further confirmation and
quantification of ATRA-induced cellular differentiation of MM-119-P cells, we next conducted cotransfection experiments with
XAB2-expressing plasmids (pcDNA3-XAB2) or mock plasmid
(pcDNA3) and GFP-expressing plasmids (pEGFP-C1) for visualization. As shown in Fig. 1B, no change was observed both in MM-119-P cells transfected with mock and GFP-expressing plasmids and
in MM-1-19-P cells transfected with XAB2- and GFP-expressing
plasmids (a and c). On the other hand, myocytic cellular
differentiation following treatment with ATRA was significantly
observed in mock-transfected MM-1-19-P cells, which were
cotransfected with GFP-expressing plasmid (Fig. 1B, b). However,
cellular differentiation to myotube-like giant cell induced by ATRA
was not detected in MM-1-19-P cells transfected with XAB2

expression plasmid (Fig. 1B, d). To quantify the number of ATRAinduced differentiated cells in the mock- and XAB2-transfected
MM-1-19-P cell population, we counted the myotube-like giant
cells expressing GFP under examination by fluorescence and
bright-field microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1C, MM-1-19-P cells
transfected with mock and GFP vectors exhibited an increase in
the number of differentiated cells (Fig. 1C, #). However, ATRAinduced differentiation of XAB2-transfected MM-1-19-P cells was
significantly inhibited (Fig. 1C, ##). These results suggest that XAB2
has an inhibitory effect on ATRA-mediated cellular differentiation.
To confirm the inhibitory effect of XAB2 on ATRA-induced cell
differentiation, CAT assays were done with the RAR reporter
plasmid containing a RARE under the control of a thymidine kinase
minimal promoter (pRARE-CAT). HepG2 cells were transiently
transfected with pcDNA3-XAB2, which allows for the constitutive
expression of XAB2, and were grown in the presence or absence of
ATRA. In mock (pcDNA3)-transfected cells, CAT activity was
induced 5-fold by ATRA. However, the ATRA-induced CAT
activation was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by XAB2
(Fig. 1D). These results suggest that XAB2 suppresses ATRAactivated transcription.
To further determine whether the overexpressed XAB2 protein
plays an inhibitory role in ATRA-induced activation of transcription, we analyzed ATRA-targeted gene expression pattern in
HEK293T cells by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). For this
purpose, two RARa target genes, RARb and CYP26, were selected
(47). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-XAB2
to allow for the constitutive expression of XAB2 and were grown in
the presence or absence of ATRA. Total RNA was purified and RTPCR using RARh-, CYP26-, and h-actin-specific primers was done.
As shown in Fig. 1E, in mock (pcDNA3)-transfected cells, endogenous RARh and CYP26 mRNA expression was induced by ATRA
(lanes 1 and 2). However, the ATRA-induced RARh and CYP26
expression was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by XAB2
(Fig. 1E, lanes 3–6). Exogenous XAB2 transfection did not affect the
expression level of endogenous RARh and CYP26 mRNA (Fig. 1E,
lanes 1, 3, and 5). These results confirm our earlier data indicating
that XAB2 suppresses ATRA-activated gene transcription.
Knockdown of XAB2 by siRNA enhances cellular differentiation of HL60 cells induced by ATRA. To further define an
inhibitory effect of XAB2 on ATRA-induced cellular differentiation,
we next used the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60,
which is induced to differentiate to neutrophilic cells by various
drugs including ATRA (48). For this purpose, we prepared two
separate siRNA against XAB2, as described in Materials and
Methods, to ensure the specificity of the knockdown effect. As
shown in Fig. 2A, these siRNAs against XAB2 (ss1 and ss2)
effectively knocked down XAB2 expression in HL60 cells (top,
lanes 2 and 4). Because XAB2 in HL60 cells was not significantly
knocked down by control siRNA (Fig. 2A, top, lanes 1 and 3) and
expression level of tubulin as a housekeeping protein was not
affected by both of siRNAs (Fig. 2A, bottom), this inhibitory effect of
XAB2 by siRNAs in HL60 cells was specific. In addition, the
expression levels of HDAC3 and RARa were not changed in the
presence or absence of siRNA treatment (data not shown). We next
examined ATRA-induced cellular differentiation of HL60 cells in
the presence or absence of siRNAs against XAB2 through flow
cytometric analysis of cell-surface expression level of CD11b (49).
As shown in Fig. 2B, ATRA-induced HL60 cell differentiation was
enhanced in a dose-dependent manner with treatment with siRNAs
against XAB2 as compared with the level of differentiation

Figure 1. XAB2 inhibits ATRA-induced cellular differentiation and transcriptional activation. A, ATRA-sensitive human rhabdomyosarcoma MM-1-19-P cells were transiently
transfected with pcDNA3 as a vector control (a) or pcDNA-XAB2 (b). Twelve hours later, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh media containing 2 Amol/L
ATRA. After 24-h incubation, cells were visualized with phase-contrast microscopy. Black and white arrowheads, differentiated cells that form myotube-like processes.

Cells were treated with DMSO vehicle as a control (a and c) or with ATRA (b and d) by the same method as described in (A) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.
Because the amount of pcDNA3-XAB2 transfected is five times more than that of pEGFP-C1, GFP-positive cells definitely contains exogenous XAB2. C, percentage of

treated with 100 nmol/L ATRA or DMSO vehicle as a control. Cells were then harvested after 24 h and assayed for h-galactosidase and CAT activity. For transfection efficiency,
CAT activity was normalized to h-galactosidase activity. The CAT activity in control cells treated with DMSO vehicle and a mock vector was set as equal to one and all
other values are expressed as fold induction. Columns, mean from triplicate experiments; bars, SE. E, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 empty or

transfection, cells were treated with 1 Amol/L ATRA or DMSO vehicle as a control. Cells were then harvested after 24 h and total RNA was extracted. RT-PCR assays using
primers for RARh, CYP26, and h-actin (as internal control) were then done. All experiments were done at least thrice with similar results.

observed in HL60 cells treated with control siRNA. These data
suggest that specific knockdown of XAB2 enhances ATRA-induced
cellular differentiation at physiologic levels (10 9–10 8 mol/L) as
well as at therapeutic levels (10 7 mol/L).
To further confirm whether knockdown of XAB2 enhances
ATRA-induced gene expression, we analyzed ATRA-targeted gene
expression pattern in HL60 cells by RT-PCR, in the presence or absence of siRNA against XAB2. As shown in Fig. 2C, ATRA-induced
mRNA expression of RARh and CYP26 was increased in a dosedependent manner (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). The increased expression
of RARh and CYP26 mRNA was further enhanced in HL60 cells
treated with siRNA against XAB2 (Fig. 2C, lane 4 versus lanes 5 and
6, lane 7 versus lanes 8 and 9 , and lane 10 versus
lanes 11 and 12). This enhanced expression of RARh and CYP26

mRNA was again observed to be dependent on ATRA doses
(Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6, 8 and 9, and 11 and 12). These data suggest
that specific knockdown of XAB2 enhances not only cellular
differentiation but also induction of ATRA-targeted genes at
physiologic (10 9–10 8 mol/L) and therapeutic (10 7 mol/L) levels.
XAB2 is associated with HDAC3. Retinoid-dependent cellular
differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cell lines was previously
shown to be mediated by HDAC activity (12, 15, 50). We thus
examined whether XAB2 involvement in retinoid mediatedtranscriptional regulation is through HDAC activity. For this
purpose, the potential association of XAB2 with HDAC activity on
RAR-regulated transcription was examined via RARE-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays, which were done on the
RAR reporter plasmid containing a RARE under the control of

thymidine kinase minimal promoter (pRARE-CAT). HepG2 cells
were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-XAB2 to allow for the
constitutive expression of XAB2 and were then grown in the
presence or absence of ATRA. As shown in Fig. 3A, transcriptional
activity was significantly enhanced by ATRA addition (Fig. 3A, #),
and this ATRA-induced transcriptional activity was decreased in
the presence of overexpression of XAB2 (Fig. 3A, ##). Moreover,
the addition of trichostatin A or sodium butyrate, specific
inhibitors of HDAC, completely antagonized the repression by
XAB2 of RAR reporter activity (Fig. 3A, ###). To further confirm
the antagonistic effect of HDAC inhibitors on XAB2-mediated
repression, we analyzed the expression level of endogenous
retinoic acid–targeted genes RARb and CYP26. As shown in
Fig. 3B, the mRNA level of RARh and CYP26 was enhanced by
ATRA addition (lane 2), and this ATRA-induced enhancement of
RARh and CYP26 mRNA expression was decreased by XAB2
overexpression (lane 3). In contrast, the addition of trichostatin A
or sodium butyrate completely antagonized the repression by
XAB2 of ATRA-induced RARh and CYP26 mRNA expression (Fig.
3B, lanes 4 and 5).

These data suggest that the XAB2-mediated inhibitory effect of
ATRA-induced transcriptional activity is associated with HDAC
activity.
To further explore XAB2 association with HDACs, we next
evaluated the potential interaction of XAB2 with HDACs in a
transcriptional component through coimmunoprecipitation assays.
HEK293T cells were transfected with an expression plasmid of
GFP-XAB2 alone or together with expression plasmids of FlagHDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC4, and HDAC6 (Fig. 3C, top). The FlagHDACs were immunoprecipitated with antibody against the Flag

the GFP-XAB2 protein was coimmunoprecipitated with FlagHDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC4, and HDAC6 from HEK293T cell lysates
(middle, lanes 1 and 3–5). No cellular protein was detected by
the anti-GFP antibody in immunoprecipitants of lysates of
HEK293T cells transfected with Flag-vector control plasmid
(middle, lane 2). The expression level of GFP-XAB2 was not
affected by the presence or absence of Flag-HDACs (Fig. 3C,

butyrate (1 mmol/L). Cells were then harvested after 24 h and total RNA was extracted. RT-PCR assays using primers for RARh, CYP26, and h-actin (as internal

After 24-h transfection, cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 mAb and then Western blotted with anti-Flag M2
mAb (top ) or anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (middle ). Ten micrograms of nuclear extracts were Western blotted with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody to show equal
expression of transfected GFP-XAB2 protein (bottom ). Asterisk, nonspecific bands. D, in the absence of ATRA, nuclear extracts were prepared from HL60 cells and
immunoprecipitation (IP ) assays were conducted with anti-XAB2 antibody or control immunoglobulin (cIgG ). Immunoprecipitation complexes, along with 10% input
of nuclear extract, were then separated by 4% to 20% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with indicated antibodies. Representative results obtained from three
independent experiments.

Various HDACs have previously been reported to be involved in
RARa-mediated transcriptional regulation via interaction with
N-CoR/SMRT (20, 51, 52). However, the identity of the precise
HDACs involved remains controversial, partly because of the
different cell types or assay systems being used. We therefore
attempted to determine the specific HDACs among HDAC1,
HDAC3, HDAC4, or HDAC6 that are associated with XAB2 in our
system. For this purpose, immunoprecipitation assays detecting
endogenous HDACs and XAB2 proteins were done on nuclear

extract of HL60 cells. As shown in Fig. 3D, endogenous HDAC1,

(lane 1), with each control immunoglobulin G (IgG) not able
to precipitate endogenous HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC4, HDAC6, and

detected in the complex precipitated by XAB2 whereas very slight
amount of HDAC1 was coprecipitated with XAB2. On the other
hand, no portion of HDAC4 or HDAC6 was detected in the complex
(lane 2). These data indicate that XAB2 is associated mainly with

HDAC3 in our system and that XAB2 associates with HDAC3dependent transcriptional components that interact with RARE.
ATRA leads to dissociation of XAB2 from RARA and HDAC3.
As shown above, XAB2 is associated mostly with HDAC3 and is
involved in the suppression of ATRA-mediated cellular differentiation. We next examined potential alterations in the complex
containing endogenous XAB2, RARa, and HDAC3 after ATRA
treatment. For this purpose, we conducted immunoprecipitation
experiments using nuclear extracts of HL60 cells incubated in
the presence or absence of ATRA. As shown in Fig. 4A, XAB2 was
found with RARa and HDAC3 in immunoprecipitation complexes
of nuclear extracts of untreated cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 4).
Following treatment of HL60 cells with ATRA for 24 to 72 h, XAB2
and HDAC3 were dissociated from RARa (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3)
and, similarly, RARa and HDAC3 were dissociated from XAB2
(Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). At these time points, Western blot analysis
of nuclear extracts revealed that the expression level of HDAC3
was decreased by ATRA treatment (Fig. 4B, middle), whereas the
expression levels of XAB2 and tubulin were not changed. These
data indicate that XAB2 forms a complex with RARa and HDAC3

and that, following ATRA treatment, XAB2 is disengaged from the
complex without degradation while HDAC3 is degraded, as
previously reported (22).
To further characterize the association among XAB2, HDAC3,
and RARa, we did fluorescence microscopic analysis to determine
the subcellular localization of these structures. As shown in Fig. 4C,
XAB2 clearly colocalized with RARa, as well as HDAC3, in the
nuclei of untreated HL60 cells (a–c and g–i). Following treatment
of HL60 cells with ATRA, XAB2 was not found to colocalize with
RARa (d–f ). Moreover, whereas XAB2 was localized in the
nuclei after ATRA treatment (e and j), HDAC3 was not detected
in the nuclei after ATRA treatment (k). Taken together, these data
indicate that XAB2 associates with HDAC3 and RARa in the nuclei
of untreated HL60 cells, with ATRA treatment resulting in the
subsequent disengagement of XAB2 and HDAC3 from the complex.
Furthermore, ATRA treatment induces change of localization
of XAB2 in the nuclei while HDAC3 is degraded as reported
previously (22).
To further confirm that XAB2, RARa, and HDAC3 bind to the
same ATRA-targeted gene promoters and that XAB2 and HDAC3

(cIgG ; lanes 3 and 4). Antibodies for XAB2
(lanes 5 and 6), HDAC3 (lanes 7 and 8 ),
RARa (lanes 9 and 10 ), and acetylated
histone H4 (Ac-H4 ; lanes 11 and 12 ) were
used for immunoprecipitation of the
endogenous proteins. PCR was done
using primers for RARh and CYP26
promoters containing RARE as described
in Materials and Methods. All experiments
were done at least thrice with similar
results.

disengage from these genes following ATRA treatment, we did
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with HL60 cells. For this
purpose, HL60 cells were treated in the presence or absence of
ATRA for 24 h, followed by cross-linking by formaldehyde, and
chromatin-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using
control IgG, anti-XAB2 pAb, anti-HDAC3 pAb, anti-RARa pAb, or
anti–acetyl-histone H4 pAb. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays against endogenous RARh and CYP26 promoters that
contain RARE sequences were done (47). As shown in Fig. 4D,
endogenous XAB2 and HDAC3 were recruited to RARh and CYP26
promoters in the absence of ATRA (lanes 5 and 7). However, in the
presence of ATRA, endogenous XAB2 and HDAC3 were released
from RARh and CYP26 promoters (Fig. 4D, lanes 6 and 8). On the
other hand, endogenous RARa bound to RARh and CYP26
promoters constitutively in the presence or absence of ATRA
(Fig. 4D, lanes 9 and 10). Moreover, to determine the acetylation
level of histones around the RARE region of RARb and CYP26
genes, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with anti–acetylated
histone H4 pAb were done. In the absence of ATRA, histone
acetylation levels of RARh and CYP26 promoters were decreased

(Fig. 4D, lane 11). On the other hand, in the presence of ATRA,
histone acetylation level of these promoters was significantly
increased (Fig. 4D, lane 12). These data suggest that XAB2 forms a
complex with RARa and HDAC3 on the same ATRA-targeted genes
and that, following ATRA treatment, XAB2 and HDAC3 are
disengaged from the complex, which is associated with increased
level of promoter histone acetylation.
Knockdown of XAB2 by siRNA induces differentiation of
ATRA-resistant neuroblastoma cell line. In view of XAB2
inhibitory effect on ATRA-mediated transcriptional activity and
cellular differentiation, we examined the effect of XAB2 on ATRAmediated cellular differentiation of ATRA-resistant cells. For this
purpose, we conducted siRNA experiments using the ATRAresistant human neuroblastoma cell line IMR-32 (53). We prepared
two specific siRNAs against XAB2 as described in Materials and
Methods, which effectively knocked down XAB2 expression in IMR32 cells (Fig. 5A, top, lanes 2 and 4). Because XAB2 in IMR-32 cells
was not significantly knocked down by control siRNA (Fig. 5A, top,
lanes 1 and 3) and expression level of tubulin as a housekeeping
protein was not affected by both siRNAs (Fig. 5A, bottom), the

ATRA-Mediated Differentiation by XAB2 Knockdown

Discussion

cellular differentiation. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, XAB2 forms a
complex with RARa and HDAC3 and is dissociated from RARa and
HDAC3 in the presence of ATRA treatment. In the absence of
ligands for RAR-RXR dimers such as ATRA, genes targeted by the
receptors are repressed (reviewed in ref. 3). This is due to the
recruitment of HDAC-containing complexes that are tethered
through corepressors, such as N-CoR/SMRT, to the nonliganded
RAR-RXR dimers. Moreover, the repressive activity of the N-CoR/
SMRT complex results from direct or indirect association with
HDAC3, leading to the formation of a stoichiometric core complex
with N-CoR/SMRT (24, 54). Our data shown in Figs. 3 and 4 suggest
that XAB2 is associated with corepressor complexes that bind to
RARa and/or HDAC3 to repress transcriptional activity in the
absence of ATRA. On the other hand, on binding of ligands to
RAR, the corepressor interface is destabilized to generate a novel
interaction surface for coactivators such as histone acetyltransferases and cAMP-responsive element binding protein–binding
proteins or p300, leading to transcription initiation (3). To switch
from corepressors to coactivators following ligand binding to
RARa-RXR, specific adaptors are required for dismissal and
subsequent degradation by ubiquitination of corepressors N-CoR/
SMRT/HDAC3 (22, 24). TBL1/TBLR1 has been reported to serve as
specific adaptors for the recruitment of the ubiquitin-conjugating
proteosome complex to degrade N-CoR/SMRT/HDAC3 (55). In this

In this study, we showed that overexpression of XAB2 inhibited
ATRA-induced cellular differentiation of the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line MM-1-19-P and that knockdown of XAB2 by
siRNA enhanced ATRA-mediated cellular differentiation of the
human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60. Moreover, we found
that XAB2 was associated with RARa and HDAC3 in the nuclei.
Finally, we showed that, following treatment with siRNA specific
against XAB2, the ATRA-resistant neuroblastoma cell line IMR-32
underwent cellular differentiation when incubated with ATRA at a
therapeutic concentration.
XAB2 has been isolated by virtue of its ability to interact with
XPA in the yeast two-hybrid system (33). Xeroderma pigmentosum patients show striking hypersensitivity to sunlight and an
extremely high incidence of skin cancer in sun-exposed areas, as
well as frequently progressive neurologic degeneration (40).
Antibodies against the XAB2 protein has been shown to inhibit
transcription in non–UV-irradiated normal cells, strongly suggesting that XAB2 can be a novel factor involved in the
transcription process itself. In addition, it has previously been
shown that retinoids are effective in treating preneoplastic
diseases including xeroderma pigmentosum and other dermatologic diseases such as photoaging. We thus aimed to analyze the
effect of XAB2 on retinoid-mediated transcription in the present
study, especially on ATRA-mediated cellular differentiation, as
cancer therapy. Our in vitro analyses shown in Figs. 1 and 2
showed that XAB2 has an inhibitory effect on ATRA-induced
cellular differentiation of ATRA-sensitive neoplastic cell lines and
that ATRA-mediated transcriptional activity is inhibited by XAB2
in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, expression levels of
endogenous RARa and HDAC3 are not affected by overexpression of exogenous XAB2 or by knockdown of XAB2 by
siRNA (Figs. 2, 3, and 5). These results suggest that XAB2 plays
an inhibitory role in ATRA-induced cellular differentiation by
being functionally associated with the transcriptional repressor
complex existing in RARE.
Our next focus in this study was to analyze the molecular
mechanisms of XAB2-mediated inhibitory effect on ATRA-induced

N-CoR/SMRT corepressor complexes. See text for details.

observed inhibition of XAB2 expression by its siRNA was specific.
In addition, the expression levels of RARa and HDAC3 were not
altered by treatment of XAB2-specific siRNA (data not shown). We
next examined the effect of ATRA on cell differentiation of IMR-32
cells with XAB2 expression being knocked down by siRNA. As
shown in Fig. 5B, changes consistent with cell differentiation
following treatment with ATRA were not observed in ATRAresistant IMR-32 cells treated with control siRNA (a). On the other
hand, ATRA-resistant IMR-32 cells treated with two separate
siRNAs against XAB2 exhibited ATRA-induced cell differentiation
(b and c). Quantification of cell differentiation by ATRA in IMR-32
cells is shown in Fig. 5C. As shown in microscopic observation
study (Fig. 5B, a–c), neurite-like differentiation of ATRA-resistant
IMR-32 induced by ATRA treatment was significantly increased in
cells treated with siRNAs against XAB2 (Fig. 5C, # and ##)
compared with cell treated with control siRNA (Fig. 5C, ###).
Although the precise mechanisms of ATRA resistance in IMR-32
have not yet been revealed (53), these data suggest that XAB plays
an inhibitory role in ATRA-induced cell differentiation and that
knockdown of XAB2 in selected ATRA-resistant tumors induces
ATRA-mediated cellular differentiation.

regard, although it is presently unclear whether XAB2 is degraded
or recycled via an unknown pathway, XAB2 remains localized in the
nuclei after ATRA treatment (Fig. 4) while still disengaging a
corepressor complex containing N-CoR/SMRT, HDAC3, and XAB2
from RARa-RXR on RARE (Fig. 4), potentially mediating corepressor/coactivator exchange.
Our findings suggest XAB2 interaction with corepressor complex
containing HDAC3 and RARa through biochemical assays revealing
protein-protein association and cellular assays showing biological
effects (Figs. 3 and 4). However, our data also raise questions about
the functional implication of XAB2 binding to HDAC3 and RARa.
As shown in Fig. 3, endogenous XAB2 was mainly associated with
HDAC3, whereas a small amount of HDAC1 was coprecipitated
with XAB2. In fact, the precise mechanism of HDACs involvement
in retinoid signaling is controversial (56). We therefore could not
exclude the possibility that HDAC1 is involved in XAB2-associated
retinoid signaling, a topic which will be elucidated in future studies.
Another issue raised by our findings is whether XAB2 is involved
in other nuclear receptor systems than RARa, such as vitamin D
receptor or thyroid hormone receptor (24). Indeed, corepressor
complex such as N-CoR/SMRT/HDACs also regulates other nuclear
receptor systems than RARa (19), suggesting that XAB2 may be
possibly involved in other transcriptional systems. Whereas data
shown in our present study were obtained in transient transfection
systems, we plan to examine the inhibitory effect of XAB2 on
retinoid signaling or other nuclear receptor systems with stably
transfected systems of overexpression and siRNAs in future studies.
On the basis of our results, we propose a model to describe the
role of XAB2 in cell responsiveness to retinoids (Fig. 6). In this
model, unliganded RARa-RXR heterodimers bind to RARE and
recruit HDAC3 complexes containing XAB2, followed by suppression of target genes for differentiation blockade (Fig. 6, a). On

binding of ligands such as ATRA to RARa, N-CoR/SMRT/HDAC3
corepressors are dismissed and subsequently degraded by ubiquitination, which is mediated by specific adaptors such as TBL1/
TBLR1 (Fig. 6, b and c). Subsequently, coactivator complexes such
as cAMP-responsive element binding protein–binding protein or
p300 are recruited, leading to target gene activation and
differentiation programs (Fig. 6, d). The potential clinical relevance
of this model is revealed by the fact that pharmacologic
concentrations of ATRA are required in the presence of XAB2 to
disrupt this complex. However, combining ATRA treatment with
knockdown of XAB2 by siRNA allows for the dissociation of the
repressor complex containing HDAC3 and XAB2, leading subsequently to cellular differentiation.
Work over the past decades has shown that retinoids and their
cognate receptors are required for the proper functioning of a
number of organs, including the skin, and of the neuronal system
and for prevention and treatment of selected cancers (17, 57, 58).
One of the important objectives of cancer differentiation therapy is
to selectively induce growth inhibition through RAR-dependent
pathways. Our findings therefore should have broad implications
for potential therapy not only for ATRA-sensitive cancer such as
acute promyelocytic leukemia and rhabdomyosarcoma but also for
ATRA-resistant solid tumors including neuroblastoma.
