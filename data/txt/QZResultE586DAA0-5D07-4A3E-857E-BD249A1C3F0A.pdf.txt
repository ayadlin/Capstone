ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most common and lethal adult primary
tumor of the brain, showed a link between Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway in the
resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). PTCH1, the SHH receptor, can tonically represses
signaling by endocytosis. We asked how the decrease in PTCH1 in GBM cells could lead
to TMZ-resistance. TMZ resistant GBM cells have increased PTCH1 mRNA and reduced
protein. Knockdown of Dicer, a Type III RNAase, indicated that miRNAs can explain
the decreased PTCH1 in TMZ resistant cells. Computational studies, real-time PCR,
reporter gene studies, western blots, target protector oligos and ectopic expression
identified miR-9 as the target of PTCH1 in resistant GBM cells with concomitant
activation of SHH signaling. MiR-9 mediated increases in the drug efflux transporters,
MDR1 and ABCG2. MiR-9 was increased in the tissues from GBM patients and in an
early passage GBM cell line from a patient with recurrent GBM but not from a naïve
patient. Pharmacological inhibition of SHH signaling sensitized the GBM cells to TMZ.
Taken together, miR-9 targets PTCH1 in GBM cells by a SHH-independent method in
GBM cells for TMZ resistance. The identified pathways could lead to new strategies
to target GBM with combinations of drugs.

25 kDa secreted mitogen with paracrine and autocrine
function in development [5]. A 45 kDa SHH pre-propeptide
is autocatalyzed by the C-terminus, resulting in an active
N-terminus fragment, SHH-N [6]. A palmitate is added
to the N-terminus of SHH-N, which interacts with the
transporter, Dispatched, for secretion [7]. The interaction
between SHH and its 12-transmembrane Patched (PTCH1)
receptor de-represses SMO, which signals through a
G-protein receptor complex [8]. SHH signaling mainly
occurs by the transcriptional factor, glioma-associated
oncogene 1 (Gli1), which is a downstream of SMO. The
over-activation of SHH signaling has been implicated in
several tumors, including GBM [9].
MicroRNAs (miRs) are small, non-coding RNAs
that are involved in biological processes such as neural
patterning, development and oncogenesis [10, 11]. MiRs

INTRODUCTION
Gliobastoma (GBM), the most common and
aggressive adult human primary brain tumor with a
median survival of 11 months and 5% survival at 5 years
of diagnosis. The treatment for GBM includes surgery,
radiotherapy and, Temozolomide (TMZ) or Bevacizumab
(Avastin®) [1]. In a recent report, Bevacizumab, which is
a humanized monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial
growth factor A, has been reported to have little
improvement as compared to the standard treatment and,
with a worse quality of life for the patients [2].
The cellular pathways involved in the growth and
survival of GBM include phosphoinositol-3-phosphate
Kinase (PI3K), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK),
and sonic hedgehog (SHH) [3, 4]. SHH is a dual lipidated

are considered as post-transcriptional regulators of genes
[12]. This occurs through their interactions with the 3′
UTR of transcripts (mRNA) to suppress translation. MiRs
and their targets are generally conserved, suggesting their
critical role in development [13].
MiR can regulate the functions of SHH by targeting
SMO and Gli1 [14]. MiR-9 has been implicated in genes
linked to neurodevelopment such as those associated with
chromatin remodeling and malignancy [15, 16]. There are
three functional loci for miR in the human genome, miR9-1, -2 and -3 [17]. We previously reported on an increase
in miR-9 in TMZ-resistant GBM cells. We also showed
that this miRNA could be targeted by delivering its antimiRNA in stem cells [18]. MiR-9 regulates key genes in
neurodevelopment by synergising with its complementary
miR-9*. In this relationship, miR-9 targets REST and
miR-9* targets Co-REST [14, 19].
Since mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells
can be used in therapeutic delivery for GBM, there is a
need to further study the mechanism by which miR-9 is
involved in GBM resistance [20–22]. This study reports
on the molecular mechanisms by which TMZ-induced
miR-9 in GBM cells. We showed that miR-9 suppresses
PTCH1, which sustained signaling. We also showed that
this signaling occurred in a ligand-independent manner.

intracellular SHH, we asked if this could be explained by
its role in protecting the GBM cells from TMZ treatment.
We compared SHH knockdown GBM cells with cells
transfected with a non-targeting oligo. The efficiency of
SHH knockdown is shown in Figures 1C, S2. The presence
or absence of SHH did not change the pattern of TMZ
resistance since there was no significant (p > 0.05) change
in cell viability between the control and knockdown cells
(Figure 1D). These results indicated that SHH was not
involved in the resistance of GBM to TMZ.

Dicer-knockdown sensitized GBM cells to TMZ
The level of SHH in the untreated and TMZtreated GBM cells could not explain why PTCH1 protein
was decreased in TMZ resistant GBM cells (Figure 1B).
Although PTCH protein was decreased its corresponding
mRNA was increased in the TMZ-treated GBM cells
(Figures 1A, 1B). This indicated that the translation of
PTCH1 mRNA was suppressed. We asked if miRNA
could be responsible for the suppressed translation [10].
We blocked the processing of all miRNAs by knockdown
of RNase type III Dicer in U87 and T98G cells and then
compared with non-targeting oligo transfectants (control).
Western blot with whole cell extracts verified dicer
knockdown (Figures 1E, S3). Western blots with whole cells
extracts from TMZ-treated dicer knockdown cells failed to
decrease PTCH1 protein (Figures 1F, S4). Together, these
studies supported a role for miRNA in the suppression of
PTCH1 translation in TMZ-resistant GBM cells.
Since dicer knockdown maintained high expression
of PTCH1 protein (Figure 1F), we asked if the sustained
presence of PTCH1 sensitized the GBM cells to TMZ.
U87 and T98G cells were knockdown for dicer or
transfected with non-targeting oligos and then treated
with 200 μM TMZ. After 72 h, we performed viability
studies. The results, presented as % cell death, showed a
significant (p < 0.05) increase in cell death when dicer
was knocked down as compared to non-targeting oligo
control (Figure 1G). Considering the relevance of dicer in
miRNA processing [28], the results indicated that miRNAs
suppress PTCH1 and this induced TMZ resistance.

RESULTS
SHH-independent resistance to TMZ
SHH signaling has been proposed as a target of antineoplastic agents, such as TMZ [23, 24]. SHH signaling
occurs with decreased PTCH1 [25]. This study investigated
if TMZ resistant cells showed a decrease in PTCH1. GBM
cells treated for 72 h resulted in ~30% viability. The
surviving cells expressed high levels of the MDR1 gene
and resisted TMZ [26]. We established TMZ-resistant U87
and T98G cells and then studied them for PTCH mRNA
and protein by qPCR and western blot, respectively. Figure
1A show the fold change in PTCH mRNA. The vehicletreated point for each cell line was normalized to 1. Since
a similar normalization was performed for each cell line,
one bar is shown to represent both cell lines. The changes
in TMZ-treated cells were presented as fold change over
the vehicle-treatment. PTCH mRNA was significantly
(p < 0.05) increased in the TMZ resistant cells (Figure 1A)
whereas its corresponding protein was decreased (Figures
1B, S1). These results suggested that TMZ could induce
post-transcriptional regulation of PTCH1.
The interaction between PTCH1 and its ligand,
SHH, can lead to endocytic degradation of PTCH [27].
Whole cell extracts from TMZ- and vehicle- treated
U87 and T98G were studied for intracellular SHH by
western blot. TMZ did not cause any change in the band
densities for the precursor (SHH-P) or the mature ligand
(SHH-N) (Figures 1B, S1). Due to the sustained level of

MiR-9 in the resistance of GBM to TMZ
This set of studied sought the identity of the
candidate miRNA(s) in TMZ resistance. We focused on
the miRNA(s) that could target PTCH1. An analysis of
the 3′ UTR of PTCH1 identified potential interacting
sites for mir-9, mir-16, mir-101, mir-141 and mir-200a
(Figure 2A, Table S1). Time-course real time PCR with
viable TMZ-treated GBM cells indicated a significant
(p < 0.05) increase in miR-9 at 72 h (Figure 2B).
Mature miR-9 can be derived from three different
loci at distinct chromosomes: miR-9-1, -2 and/or -3.

cells with primers specific for the three different miRs
[29] indicated a significant (p < 0.05) increase in miR9-2 (Figure 2C). We next asked if miR-9 is responsible
for TMZ resistance by studying the viability of miR-9knockdown GBM cells that were treated with 200 μM of
TMZ for 72 h. Control studies used GBM cells transfected
with non-targeting oligo. The knockdown cells (antimiR-9) showed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in cell
viability as compared to control (Figure 2D). This finding
was significant considering that miR-9 has been linked to
neurogenesis and malignancy [15, 30].
We analyzed the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
with >500 different GBM samples for miR-9 expression
(Figure 2E). There was >2 fold increase in miR-9, shown in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the enlarged section of the heat map (Figure 2E, lower left,
arrow). Together, this section indicated that miR-9 is increased
in TMZ resistant GBM cells and primary GBM cells.

MiR-9 targets PTCH1 mRNA
TMZ-resistant GBM cells showed an increase
in miR-9 and a decrease in PTCH1 (Figures 1, 2). We
therefore investigated if miR-9 can target PTCH1. This
question was addressed with a reporter gene system
(luciferase) and CCL64 cells. This cell line was a good
model to study the relationship between miR-9 and
PTCH1 expression because they do not express miR-9 but
expressed PTCH1 (Figure S5).

Oncotarget

CCL64 cells were stably transfected with a reporter
gene vector in which the 3′UTR was inserted downstream
of luciferase (pPTCH-UTR-JM). Parallel cultures were
transfected with vector alone. The stable transfectants
were transiently transfected with pre-miR-9 or a nontargeting oligo (control). Pre-miR-9 significantly (p < 0.05)
decreased luciferase as compared to the control (Figure
3A). The specificity of the pre-miR-9 was studied with a
target protection oligo (TP). The TP competed with premiR-9 for the interacting site on the 3′ UTR of PTCH1.
The TP prevented miR-9 to decrease luciferase levels
(Figure 3A, hatched bar). Western blots for PTCH1 with
whole cell extracts from the reporter gene transfectants
indicated a decrease in PTCH1 protein by transfected
anti-miR-9 (Figure 3B). This was specific since the effect
was reversed with TP (Figure 3B). Together there was
consistency between the reporter gene studies and western
blot with regards to PTCH1 being a target of miR-9.
Next, we asked if miR-9 decreased PTCH1 in the
TMZ resistant GBM cells. We stably transfected U87 and
T98G cells with pPTCH-UTR-JM or control pPTCHUTRΔ-JM (no miR-9-binding region). The transfectants
were transiently transfected with anti-miR-9 or non-targeting
oligos and then treated with 200 μM TMZ. After 72 h, the
viable cells were studied for luciferase. Transfection of antimiR-9 caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in luciferase
in the pPTCH-UTR-JM transfectants as compared to
controls (Figure 3C, bars 2 and 3). MiR-9 was blocked
from interacting with the 3′ UTR of PTCH by transfecting
with pPTCH-UTRΔ-JM (miR-9 null site). The resulted in
TMZ treatment luciferase activity that was similar to the
anti-miR-9 (Figure 3C, bars 3 and 4). Together, the results
indicated that miR-9 can suppress the translation of PTCH1
in TMZ resistant GBM cells. This occurred when miR-9
interacted with the 3′ UTR of PTCH1.

with vector alone, were studied by real-time PCR and
flow cytometry for the drug transporters, MDR1 and
ABCG2. We previously reported in TMZ-induced MDR1
in GBM cells [26]. The results showed increases in the
mRNA and protein for MDR1 and ABCG2 (Figures
3H–3K). These findings are consistent with other studies,
which showed similar increases in the drug transporters
by SHH signaling [31]. In summary, there were increases
in membrane-bound MDR1 and ABCG2 in the miR-9
expressing GBM cells. These findings are consistent with
miR-9 as an activator of a similar pathway (Figure 3F).

Increased miR-9 and SHH signaling in primary
GBM cells
We studied the significance of the findings with
GBM cell lines by repeating key experiments with early
passaged GBM cells from a patient who was never treated
(BT145) and the compared with cells from a patient with
recurrent (BT164) GBM. These two cell lines allowed us
to compare a TMZ-resistant GBM cell line (BT164) with
one that was never treated with TMZ (BT145).
Real-time PCR showed increases in miR-9 and
miR-16 in the recurrent BT164 cells (Figure 4A).
MiR-9*, which is complementary to miR-9, was also
upregulated, indicating that the increase in miR-9 was
due to transcription and not stability. The increase in
miR-9-2 was similar to the data from the two cell lines,
U87 and T98G (Figure 2C). Real-time PCR also showed
an increase in miR-9-2 in the recurrent BT164 cells
(Figure 4B). We did not detect miR-9-1 or miR-9-3.
PTCH1 expression in BT164 and BT145 was
studied by real time PCR and western blot. The recurrent
BT164 cells showed an increase in PTCH1 mRNA with
reduced PTCH1 protein (Figures 4C, 4D). This disparity
between PTCH1 mRNA and its protein was similar to the
findings for TMZ resistant U87 and T98G cells (Figures
1A, 1B). Functional SHH (SHH-N) expression was not
detected in BT164 cells (Figure 4D), indicating that
the decrease in PTCH1 protein cannot be explained by
receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation
of SHH. This observation was similarly detected for U87
and T98G cell lines (Figure 1).

MiR-9-PTCH1-SHH pathway
A decrease in PTCH1 would activate the SHH
pathway. If so, this can be indicated by downstream Gli 1
(Figure 3F). We therefore performed cause-effect studies
by ectopically expressing miR-9 in U87 and T98G cells
and then determined if this reduced PTCH1 and increased
Gli 1. GBM cells were stably transfected with pCMVmiR-9 and then studied for PTCH1 and Gli 1 by real time
PCR and western blot. Ectopic expression of miR-9 and
not the empty vector decreased PTCH1 and increased Gli
1 (Figures 3D–3G). This indicated that miR-9 can activate
the SHH pathway, through a decrease in PTCH1.

Increases in ABC transporters in the recurrent
GBM tumor
TMZ resistant U87 and T98G showed increases in
functional ABC drug transporters, ABCG2 and ABCB1
(MDR1) (manuscript submitted). In this study, ectopic
expression of miR-9 in U87 and T98G resulted in
increases in the same drug transporters (Figure 3). In this
set of experiments we compared the naïve and recurrent
BT145 and BT164 cell lines for the drug transporters.
The results of real-time PCR were presented as fold
change of BT164/BT145. There were 8 folds more
for MDR1 and 4 folds for ABCG2 (Figure 4E). We

at higher concentrations (3 μM), GDC-0449 inhibited
both SMO and P-gp (ABCB1) [33]. To this end, we

chemotherapeutic agents is a major factor in treatment
failure [24].
The reactivation of SHH signaling in response to
chemotherapy has been shown to play a major role in
tumor refractoriness [24]. Although we also showed a
similar finding, the pathway leading to SHH signaling
was novel. We showed that resistance involved the posttranscriptional regulation of the PTCH1 receptor by
miRNA-9. We also identified the miR-9-2 as the type
among the three forms of this miR, which are derived at
distinct chromosomes. The identified type (miR-9-2) has
been shown to be involved in neural development.
We first showed a molecular dichotomy in which
PTCH1 mRNA is upregulated in response to TMZ
treatment yet, PTCH1 protein did not increase when
compared to untreated GBM cells (Figure 1). The
expression of the ligand, SHH, was not involved in the
resistance to TMZ (Figure 1). This indicated that a ligandindependent mechanism in PTCH1 regulation, rather than
receptor-mediated endocytosis.
MiRNAs have been shown to have major roles
in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes involved

DISCUSSION
This study reported on a decrease in PTCH1 in
GBM cells exposed to TMZ (Figure 1). This decrease was
consistent with low-passage cell line from a patient with
recurrent GBM (Figure 4). The decrease in PTCH1 was
due to an increase in miR-9, resulting in TMZ resistance
with concomitant increase in the drug transporter genes
(Figure 4). As expected, the decrease in PTCH1 resulted
in an increase in SHH signaling with increased in Gli,
indicative of Smo activation. We therefore took advantage
of this finding and use a pharmacological agent that
is FDA approved in combination with TMZ to target
SMO. The drug also targets the ABCG transporter at
a higher concentration. Targeting both the SMO and
drug transporter with TMZ led to significant cell death
of the GBM cells (Figure 5). This latter finding was
highly significant because the resistance of GBM to

in cell death and developmental processes such as cell
differentiation. In this report, we globally knockdown
miRNAs by targeting Dicer1 and showed an increase in
the death of TMZ-treated GBM cells (Figure 1). These
studies supported a role for miRNA in TMZ-resistance.
Bioinformatic analyses of the 3′ UTR of PTCH1
identified five potential miRNAs in the regulation of
PTCH1. Among the miRNAs identified, only miR-9 was
shown to be involved in TMZ resistance, specifically the
miR-9-2 gene (Figure 2). Using a cell line (CCL64) that
was PTCH+/mir–9- we demonstrated that endogenous
PTCH1 expression was suppressed by ectopic miR-9
(Figure 3). Furthermore, reporter gene studies with the
PTCH1 3′ UTR and studies with target protector (TP)
showed a direct regulation by miR-9 in the translation of
PTCH1, through interaction with the 3′ UTR.
The significance identified with studies using GBM
cell lines was supported by selected studies using miRNA
data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Figure
2E). The data showed increases in miR-9 expression,
indicating that this miRNA must be important in GBM.
In line with the observation in the TCGA, constitutive/
ectopic expression of miR-9 in GBM cells confirmed that
it can negatively regulate PTCH1 translation, resulting
in the activation of SHH signaling (Figure 4). The
central role of miR-9 in the resistance of GBM cells to
TMZ led us to investigate the accompanied indicator of
resistance. Indeed, we identified miR-9 involvement in
the upregulation of the ATP-binding Cassette transporters,
MDR1 and ABCG2 (Figure 4). At least for MDR1, this was
functional because we used an antibody that detected the
functional form of its protein, P-gp.
The significance of the finding with U87 and T98G
cell lines was supported with patient-derived cell lines
from naïve and recurrent (drug resistant) GBM. Unlike
U87 and T98G, the cell lines from patients (BT145 and
BT164) were subjected to limited passages. Comparison
of these two cell lines showed the resistant line expressed
miR-9-2 and decreased PTCH1 (Figure 4). Similar to U87
and T98G, the low-passaged cell lines also expressed
MDR1 and ABCG2 (Figure 4). MDR1 and ABCG2
expressions have been shown to be downstream targets
of SHH signaling. In this study, we showed that TMZ
resistance is at least partly caused by the upregulation of
miR-9, which in turn, regulated SHH signaling. The latter
occurred by a decrease in its inhibitor, PTCH1. Together,
this led to the upregulation of the drug efflux pumps.
Overall, we identified a number of potential targets
to overcome GBM chemoresistance. Among these targets
are miR-9, Dicer, SHH signaling, PTCH1, MDR1 and
ABCG2. The FDA-approved Vismodegib (GDC-0449)
with indications for a number of human malignancies,
has been shown to inhibit SHH signaling and also, MDR1
and ABCG2. In this report, we identified GDC-0449 as
a potentially important therapeutic agent when combined
with TMZ to induced GBM cell death (Figure 5). We
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treated the GBM cells with TMZ and the concentration
of GDC-0449 that inhibited both SHH and the drug
transporters and showed a significant increase in cell death
and caspase activation (Figure 5). The outcome with the
combined treatment was significantly more efficient as
compared to monotherapy with either drug.
In summary, we have identified a novel ligandindependent mechanism for the activation of SHH
signaling, leading to drug efflux-mediated chemoresistance
of GBM cells. We were able to support the findings with
immortalized cell lines from GBM patients, with limited
passages and with miRNA arrays from the tumor atlas. We
translated the molecular findings with the FDA-approved
Vismodegib to overcome the chemoresistance of GBM,
showed enhanced cell death. These studies suggested
that the addition of drug efflux inhibitors and SHH
inhibitors may enhance GBM cell death and prevent the
chemoresistance properties uniformly seen in this human
malignancy. Yet, the experimental evidence indicated that
miRNAs and its anti-miRs could be used in molecular
therapy to target GBM. Currently, there are methods to
develop how stem cells can be used as a cellular vehicle to
deliver RNA [34]. The transport of miRNAs from stem cells
to cancer cells has been shown to be mediated through gap
junctional communication as well as through the secretion
of exosomes [35]. However, as RNA therapeutics develop,
targeting miR-9 should be the most efficient to overcome its
induced pathway in the chemoresistance of GBM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
All cell lines used in the study ensures authentication,
as discussed in this section. U87 and T98G, WHOgrade IV glioblastoma cells, HEK293, and CCL64 lung
epithelial cells were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). The cells were
expanded as per manufacturer’s instructions and then
cryopreserved as passage 1 cells. The experiments were
performed with thawed cells up to passage 5.
BT145 (primary GBM) and BT164 (recurrent GBM)
glioma cell lines were derived from surgical resection
material acquired from patients undergoing surgery at
the Brigham and Women’s Hospital on an Institutional
Review Board approved protocol as part of the DF/BWCC
Living Tissue Bank. Briefly, tumor resection samples
were mechanically dissociated and tumorspheres were
established and propagated in Human NeuroCult NS-A
Basal media (StemCell Technologies) supplemented with
EGF, FGFβ and heparin sulfate.

Reagents and antibodies
All tissue culture media were purchased Life
Technologies (Grand Island, NY), fetal calf serum (FCS)
1198

Oncotarget

from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT), TMZ from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and GDC-0449 (Vismodegib,
Erivedge®), from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA).
Rabbit anti-human PTCH1 was custom-ordered
from Novoprotein (Short Hills, NJ). Rabbit anti-SHH,
-Dicer, -Gli1, -Caspase 3; murine anti-β-actin mAb, HRPanti-rabbit and HRP-anti-mouse IgG were purchased from
Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Murine anti-human P-gp
(UIC2 clone)-PE and anti-human ABCG2-APC were
purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA).

Flow cytometry

siRNA

Vectors and transfectants

SHH and Dicer1 targeting siRNAs were purchased
from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA); precursor miR9 (pre-miR-9) and antisense miRNA-9 (anti-miR-9) were
purchased from Life Technologies. All siRNA, pre-miRs
and anti-miRs were transfected with Lipofectamine
RNAiMax (Life Technologies).

The reporter gene vector containing the PTCH1
3′ UTR was custom ordered from Origene Technologies
(Rockville, MD). The sequence was ligated in pMirTarget,
upstream of the RFP and luciferase genes and designated,
pPTCH-UTR-JM. A mutant form of pPTCH-UTR-JM was
generated by deleting the miR-9 binding site within the
3′ UTR, designated pPTCH-UTRΔ-JM. The deletion was
achieved with the Expand Long Template PCR System
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and the following primers:
Forward, 5′-ACG CGT AAC CTT TGG GGG GTG G-3′
and Reverse, 5′-CGC CGG CGC CCT CAT TAT TAG GCA
TC-3′. The primers were synethesized with the sequences
for Sgf1 and Mlu1 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).
Direct insertion of the amplified fragment was placed into
pMirTarget using T4 DNA ligase (Clontech, Mountain
View, CA). The deletion of the miR-9 site was confirmed
by DNA sequencing at Genewiz (South Plainfield, NJ).
pCMV-miR co-expressing miR-9-2 and GFP, was
purchased from Origene Technologies and then stably
transfected in U87 and T98G cells with Effectene (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) . The stable transfectants were selected with
200 μg/mL of G148 (Invitrogen/Life Technologies).

The expressions of P-gp and ABCG2 on cell
membranes were studied by flow cytometry with murine
mAb conjugated to PE (P-gp) or to APC (ABCG2).
P-gp expression was analyzed using the UIC2 clone and
ABCG2 expression was analyzed using the 5D3 clone.
The cells were immediately analyzed on a FACS Calibur II
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, California) and the data were
analyzed with the FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).

Real-time RT-PCR
RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
and then reverse transcribed with the High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). PCR was
performed with 200 ng of cDNA using Taqman MicroRNA
Assays with specific miRNA primers (Table S1). The
amplicons were normalized with RNU6B. The primers
to recognize the microRNA-9 primary molecules were
previously reported and are presented in Table S2 [29].
Real-time PCR was performed on 7300 PCR System
(Applied Biosystems) as follows: an initial incubation of
50°C for 2 min followed by 95°C for 10 min. After this,
the cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 15 s
and 60°C for 60 s, 40 cycles. Table S1 shows the primer
sequences, which were obtained from Sigma. The relative
expression was calculated using the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)),
as previously described [35].

Transfection and reporter gene assay
CCL64, U87 and T98G cells were stably expressed with
pPTCH-UTR-JM. The vector was transfected with Effectene
Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then
selected with 200 μg/mL of G418. The CCL64 transfectants
were transiently transfected with pre-miR-9 and/or anti-miR-9
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. U87 and T98G cells were
instead exposed to 200 μM TMZ for 72 h. Protein lysates
were obtained with M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction
Reagent and then quantitated for total protein using the BioRad Protein Kit (Hercules, CA). Luciferase activity was
normalized to total protein and calculated as relative light units
(RLU). The relative expression was calculated by normalizing
to control (untreated) RLU.
Site specificity for miR-9 in luciferase activity was
verified by repeating the transient transfections, except
with the addition of target protection (TP) assay (Qiagen).
The oligos were custom-made to specifically block mir-9
binding to the PTCH1 3′ UTR. The TP and negative control
oligos were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMax.

Western blot
GBM cells were untreated and treated with vehicle
or 200 μM TMZ. At different times, whole cell extracts
were isolated with M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction
Reagent (Thermo Scientific). The extracts (3–7 μg)
were analyzed by western blots with 12% SDS-PAGE
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), as described [36]. Proteins
were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Perkin Elmer,
Boston, MA). The membranes were incubated overnight
with primary antibodies at final dilutions of 1/500-1000.
Primary antibodies were detected during a 2-h incubation
with HRP-conjugated IgG at 1/2000 final dilution. HRP
activity was detected by chemiluminescence using
SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate
(Thermo Scientific). Membranes were stripped with
Restore Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific) for reprobing
with other antibodies.
