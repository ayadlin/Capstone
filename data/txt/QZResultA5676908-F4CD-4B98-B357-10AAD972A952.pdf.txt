Abstract
The NH2 terminus of LEF1 is frequently mutated in human
sebaceous tumors. To investigate how this contributes to
cancer, we did two-stage chemical carcinogenesis on
K14#NLef1 transgenic mice, which express NH2-terminally
truncated Lef1 in the epidermal basal layer. Transgenic mice
developed more tumors, more rapidly than littermate controls, even without exposure to tumor promoter. They
developed sebaceous tumors, whereas controls developed
squamous cell carcinomas. K14#NLef1 epidermis failed to
up-regulate p53 and p21 proteins during tumorigenesis or in
response to UV irradiation, and this correlated with impaired
p14ARF induction. We propose that LEF1 NH2-terminal
mutations play a dual role in skin cancer, specifying tumor
type by inhibiting Wnt signaling and acting as a tumor
promoter by preventing induction of p53. [Cancer Res
2007;67(7):2916–21]

Introduction
Aberrant activation of canonical Wnt signaling occurs in many
tumors (1). Stabilizing mutations within the NH2 terminus of
h-catenin or genetic defects in molecules regulating h-catenin
degradation lead to nuclear accumulation of h-catenin and
activation of Tcf/Lef target genes. Transgenic mice overexpressing
a stabilized mutant form of h-catenin in the epidermis develop hair
follicle tumors (2, 3), and activating h-catenin mutations are found
in the corresponding human tumors (4).
Surprisingly, an association between tumors and inhibition of
Wnt signaling has also been reported. Mutation or deletion of the
NH2 terminus of Lef1 prevents h-catenin binding. When DN32Lef1
is expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis via the K14
promoter, mice (K14DNLef1 transgenics) develop sebaceous
tumors at high frequency (5). A high proportion of human
sebaceous adenomas and sebeomas have double nucleotide
substitutions in exon 1 of the LEF1 gene (6). These result in
E45K and S61P amino acid substitutions in the NH2 terminus,
which impair binding to h-catenin and inhibit h-catenin–
dependent transcription.
At present, it is unclear how Lef1 mutation contributes to tumor
formation. One possibility is that its role is solely to specify the

differentiated characteristics of the tumor because h-catenin
signaling levels control lineage selection in normal epidermis
(7–13). In K14DNLef1 transgenics, hair follicles convert into
epidermal cysts with sebocyte and interfollicular differentiation
(5, 13). Another possibility is that, in addition to directing the
differentiated characteristics of a tumor, Lef1 mutations increase
epidermal susceptibility to tumor development. DNLef1 and
E45K + S61P LEF1, although unable to bind h-catenin, retain
other properties, such as the ability to bind Groucho corepressors and to increase expression of Indian hedgehog (6, 12), and
these might positively contribute to tumorigenesis (e.g., by stimulating proliferation of sebocyte progenitors; ref. 12). In culture,
NH2-terminally truncated Tcf4 blocks induction of p14ARF by
h-catenin (14). Thus, DNLef1 could potentially prevent accumulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein by preventing induction
of ARF.
In the present report, we set out to test the hypothesis that
deletion of the NH2 terminus of Lef1 both directs tumor type and
stimulates tumor formation.

Materials and Methods
Experimental mice. All procedures conformed to Cancer Research UK
ethical guidelines and the terms of a British Home Office license.
K14DNLef1 transgenic mice ( founder line L; ref. 5) were maintained on a
CBA  C57Bl/6 F1 background.
Tumor experiments. Seven-week-old female K14DNLef1 transgenic
mice and wild-type littermate mice were used (15). Typically, in each
experiment, 20 wild-type and 20 transgenic mice received a subthreshold
dose of carcinogen in 200 AL acetone [100 nmol 7,12-dimethylbenz
(a)anthracene (DMBA) or 1.6 Amol benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P); Sigma]. Wildtype mice received 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 6 nmol in
200 AL acetone) thrice per week for 25 weeks, whereas transgenic mice
were treated twice per week for 10 weeks because of their high sensitivity
to TPA. Control groups of 20 mice were treated with DMBA or B[a]P
and acetone, acetone and TPA, or acetone alone. Experiments were done
twice and results obtained were similar. Scoring of tumors was carried
out once a week for up to 50 weeks after tumor initiation. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling and tissue harvesting were done as previously
described (15).
UV irradiation. Dorsal skin (4 cm2) of five K14DNLef1 transgenic
and five wild-type littermate controls were exposed to one dose of UVB
(0.36 J/m2) or UVB and UVA (1 and 10 J/m2, respectively) using a UV 801
irradiator (Waldmann GmbH, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany).
UV-exposed and nonexposed skin was harvested 24 h later.
Immunohistochemistry. For Ki67, p53, p21, and ARF immunostaining,
formalin-fixed tumor sections were deparaffinized and microwaved in Citra
Plus antigen retrieval solution (Bio Genex) for 7 min and incubated for 15
min in the retrieval solution. Sections were blocked using 0.2% fish skin
gelatin (Sigma) and probed with antibodies to Ki67 (Visionbiosystems;
1:100), mouse p53 (CM5, Novacastra; 1:500), ARF (5C3, Abcam, Cambridge,
United Kingdom), or p21 (clone SX118, Becton Dickinson; 1:500). Staining
was visualized using the ABC staining kit (Vector Laboratories). BrdUrd
incorporation was detected as previously described (15).

DNA sequencing. Exon 1 and exon 2 of the Ha-Ras gene and exons 4 to
9 of p53 were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs described in
Supplementary data.
Reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was isolated from skin and tumors using
Tri-reagent (Helena BioSciences Ltd., Gateshead, United Kingdom) and
transcribed into cDNA using Ready-to-go You-prime First-strand beads and
oligo-d(T) primer (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare). Primers are
described in Supplementary data.

Results
#NLef1 increases sensitivity to chemical carcinogenesis
and is a tumor promoter. K14DNLef1 transgenic and wild-type
littermate control mice were subjected to classic two-stage
carcinogenesis protocols (Fig. 1). The skin received one application
of DMBA or B[a]P to induce Ha-Ras mutations (15) and repeated
TPA treatments to stimulate tumor promotion.
K14DNLef1 transgenic mice treated with DMBA and TPA
developed seven times as many tumors as their wild-type

littermates (K14DNLef1: 22 tumors per mouse; wild-type: 3 tumors
per mouse; P < 0.001, Student’s t test; Fig. 1A). Transgenic animals
treated with B[a]P and TPA developed 10 times more tumors than
control mice (K14DNLef1: 16 tumors per mouse; wild-type: 1.6
tumors per mouse; P < 0.001; Fig. 1B). Of K14DNLef1 transgenic
mice, 100% developed tumors with either protocol, whereas the
proportion of tumor-bearing wild-type mice was 90% in response
to DMBA (Fig. 1C) and 65% in response to B[a]P (Fig. 1D).
In addition, tumors developed much faster in K14DNLef1 mice
than in littermate controls (Fig. 1C and D). We conclude that
K14DNLef1 transgenic mice were much more sensitive to twostage carcinogenesis than transgene-negative mice.
The classic controls in chemical carcinogenesis experiments are
to treat animals with DMBA or TPA alone (16). As predicted, wildtype mice subjected to DMBA or TPA alone did not develop tumors
(data not shown; ref. 15). TPA treatment did not affect the
spontaneous tumor incidence (<1 tumor per mouse; 27% of mice

Figure 1. Formation of benign and malignant skin tumors. Frequency (A and B) and incidence (C and D ) of tumors in wild-type and K14DNLef1 transgenic mice.
Female mice received a single subthreshold dose of DMBA (A and C ) or B[a]P (B and D ; initiation). One week later, animals were promoted with topical application of
TPA or acetone vehicle only. Mice were observed for 52 wk after initiation. The tumors in wild-type mice were a combination of papillomas and squamous cell
carcinomas. The actual numbers of mice used in the experiments shown were as follows: 18 K14DNLef1 (DMBA + TPA), 15 K14DNLef1 (B[a]P + TPA), 15 K14DNLef1
(DMBA + acetone), 15 K14DNLef1 (B[a ]P + acetone), 20 wild-type (DMBA + TPA), and 20 wild-type (B[a]P + TPA).

>3 months old develop tumors; ref. 5) in K14DNLef1 transgenics
(data not shown; ref. 5). However, in contrast to wild-type mice,
K14DNLef1 transgenics treated with DMBA or B[a]P alone
developed skin tumors; furthermore, the frequency and kinetics
were similar whether transgenics received carcinogen alone or in
combination with TPA (P = 0.388 for DMBA and TPA versus DMBA
alone; P = 0.552 for B[a]P and TPA versus B[a]P alone; Fig. 1). We
conclude that DNLef1 functions as a tumor promoter, cooperating
with Ha-Ras to induce tumor formation.
Mutations in Ha-Ras codon 61 (CAA!CTA), the signature
DMBA induced lesion (16), were detected in 10 of 10 tumors of
K14DNLef1 mice treated with DMBA or DMBA and TPA. In
contrast, no mutations in Ha-Ras exons 1 and 2 were found in five
of five spontaneous K14DNLef1 tumors. Thus, although DNLef1
promotes development of tumors with Ha-Ras mutations, Ras
mutations are not the underlying cause of the spontaneous tumors
in K14DNLef1 mice.
#NLef1 determines the differentiated characteristics of
tumors with Ha-Ras mutations. In response to DMBA and TPA,
wild-type mice first develop benign papillomas, some of which
progress (1% in Fig. 1) to malignant squamous cell carcinomas
(15, 16). Papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas have characteristics of interfollicular epidermal differentiation, including accumulation of cornified layers (Fig. 2A). In contrast, all of the tumors
induced in K14DNLef1 transgenic mice with DMBA or B[a]P F
TPA exhibited a high degree of sebocyte differentiation, resembling
the spontaneous tumors that lack Ras mutations (Fig. 2B and C).
Macroscopically, some of the K14DNLef1 tumors consisted of a
‘‘head’’ on a stalk (‘‘raised’’), resembling wild-type papillomas,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

whereas others were flattened (‘‘flat’’). However, raised tumors
were not precursors of flat tumors, and histologically they were
indistinguishable (Fig. 2B and C). We conclude that DNLef1
overrides the genetic program for squamous differentiation in
tumors bearing Ha-Ras mutations.
K14#NLef1 tumors are distinguished by reduced p53 and
p21 protein levels. We did not detect any significant difference
in the number of S-phase (BrdUrd-positive) undifferentiated cells
in wild-type and K14DNLef1 tumors (Fig. 3A; Supplementary
Table S1). This led us to consider other potential mechanisms for
the tumor-promoting effect of DNLef1. In cell culture, activation
of h-catenin induces accumulation of transcriptionally active p53
(14, 17), which in turn could protect against neoplastic conversion
(18). Because DNLef1 blocks h-catenin activation (5), we investigated whether it prevented up-regulation of p53 in skin tumors.
p53 protein is induced by oncogenic Ras (18) and, as expected,
papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas from wild-type mice
showed nuclear accumulation of p53 (n = 3; Fig. 3B; Supplementary
Table S1). Trichofolliculomas induced by prolonged activation of
h-catenin in K14DNh-cateninER transgenics (3) also displayed p53
accumulation (n = 2; Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table S1). In contrast,
the sebaceous tumors (n = 13) that developed in K14DNLef1 mice
were either negative for p53 (n = 8) or had only a small number of
positive cells (n = 5; Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table S1), regardless of
whether they were spontaneous or induced by DMBA or B[a]P F
TPA. Sequencing exons 4 to 9 of p53 in six of six DMBA/TPA–
induced K14DNLef1 tumors revealed p53 to be wild-type.
Immunohistochemical staining revealed a strong correlation
between expression of p53 and expression of the p53-responsive

gene p21 (18). Wild-type papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas
(n = 3) and K14DNh-cateninER hair follicle tumors (n = 2) stained
positive for p21 protein (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Table S1). In
contrast, K14DNLef1 sebaceous tumors (n = 13) were negative
for p21 (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Table S1). Our observations
suggest that DNLef1 prevents accumulation of transcriptionally
active p53 (14, 17).
To determine whether lack of p53 protein reflected transcriptional or posttranslational regulation, we isolated RNA from
tumors and unaffected skin of wild-type and K14DNLef1 transgenic
mice. We carried out reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with
primers for p53, p21, and ARF, a protein that increases p53 protein
stability (18). p53 and ARF mRNAs were undetectable in skin from
wild-type and transgenic animals (Fig. 3D). p53 mRNA was readily
detected in all tumors analyzed (Fig. 3D). However, wild-type and
K14DNLef1 tumors differed in ARF mRNA levels (Fig. 3D), with
wild-type tumors expressing more (Fig. 3D). In wild-type tumors
the ARF band was more intense than the p53 band, whereas in
transgenic tumors the p53 band was more intense. p21 levels were
higher in tumors than in unaffected skin, but there were no
differences between wild-type and transgenic tumors (Fig. 3D).

The reduction in ARF expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Two of two wild-type squamous cell carcinomas
and one of one wild-type papilloma contained a large number of
cells with ARF-positive nuclei (Fig. 3D). In contrast, ARF was
undetectable in three of three spontaneous tumors and 13 of 16
transgenic tumors induced by DMBA or B[a]P (Fig. 3D), and in 3 of
16 transgenic tumors there were fewer than 10 ARF-positive nuclei
per section (data not shown). Taken together, the results suggest
that the lack of detectable p53 protein in K14DNLef1 tumors
reflects rapid degradation of the protein as a result of an impaired
ability to up-regulate ARF.
Differential responsiveness of wild-type and #NLef1 epidermis to UV radiation. Up-regulation of p53 is a welldocumented response of mammalian epidermis to UV radiation
(19, 20). If induction of p53 protein is indeed impaired by
expression of DN32Lef1, then the epidermis of transgenic mice
should show increased susceptibility to UV irradiation. To test
this, we exposed transgenic and wild-type mouse back skin to
a combination of UVA and UVB (data not shown) or UVB
alone and compared exposed and unexposed skin 24 h later
(Fig. 4A–C).

Whereas the skin of wild-type mice had normal morphology
after UV treatment, the skin of K14DNLef1 mice was dramatically
altered, with regions of epidermal detachment from the dermis
(Fig. 4A, arrows). UV irradiation increased apoptosis and proliferation in both wild-type and transgenic skin (Fig. 4B; data not
shown). The fold increase in Ki67-positive cells was variable but
generally higher in transgenic (mean, 2.6; range, 1.08–4.57) than in
wild-type (mean, 1.3; range, 0.82–1.82) epidermis ( five independent
experiments).
UV irradiation resulted in strong nuclear accumulation of p53
in wild-type skin (Fig. 4C). In contrast, there were very few cells
with nuclear p53 in UV-treated K14DNLef1 skin (Fig. 4C). The
percentage of p53-positive nuclei was >70% lower in K14DNLef1
compared with wild-type epidermis (2.5% versus 9.0%; five
independent experiments; Fig. 4D). Thus, the sensitivity of
K14DNLef1 epidermis to UV-induced damage correlates with a
failure to up-regulate p53. Nuclear accumulation of ARF could

not have been detected in skin from wild-type and K14DNLef1
mice with or without UV treatment (Fig. 4C and data not
shown).

Discussion
Mutation or deletion of the NH2 terminus of LEF1 prevents
h-catenin–dependent transcriptional activation and is associated
with human and mouse sebaceous tumors (5, 6). Using K14DNLef1
transgenics, we now show that NH2-terminal deletion of Lef1
contributes to tumorigenesis in two ways. It specifies the type of
tumor formed as a result of chemically induced Ras mutations and
it acts as a tumor promoter.
Chemically induced tumors bearing Ras mutations in wild-type
epidermis usually express markers of the interfollicular epidermal
differentiation pathway (16). In contrast, chemically induced
tumors in K14DNLef1 mice contained differentiated sebocytes.

DN32Lef1 thus specifies tumor type independent of the presence
(chemically induced) or absence (spontaneous) of Ras mutations.
Our experiments do not distinguish between the alternative
possibilities that tumor type depends on the target cell (sebocyte
or interfollicular epidermal progenitor) or that a common target
cell with multilineage differentiation potential (putative stem cell)
forms different types of tumor in response to the specific signals it
receives (16). However, it is striking that the types of tumor directed
by DN32Lef1 and stabilized h-catenin reflect the differentiated
lineages selected by normal epidermis in response to different
levels of h-catenin activation (8, 16).
UV-induced mutations in p53, resulting in elevated levels of the
protein, are detected at high frequency in phenotypically normal
epidermis and are common in skin tumors (20). Human sebaceous
tumors express high levels of p53, consistent with sunlight-induced
mutations, and these could potentially drive tumor formation, with
mutant LEF1 solely specifying tumor type (6). However, our
experiments show conclusively that DNLef1 plays a positive role in
tumorigenesis, in particular acting as a strong tumor promoter in
mice treated with DMBA alone. Sequencing of K14DNLef1 tumors
did not reveal any p53 mutations and K14DNLef1 tumors lacked
detectable p53 protein. The discrepancy between the p53 status of
human and mouse sebaceous tumors may be explained by the
different time scales involved: the mouse tumors developed within

weeks (Fig. 1), whereas the average age of humans with LEF1
mutant tumors was 70 years, allowing time for additional
oncogenic changes such as accumulation of p53 mutations and
failure of DNA mismatch repair (6).
Activation of p53 by oncoproteins occurs mainly via ARF, which
binds to murine double minute-2 and thereby suppresses p53
ubiquitination and degradation (18). We found that K14DNLef1
tumors had, like wild-type tumors, elevated p53 mRNA; however,
the levels of ARF mRNA and protein were reduced. This provides
in vivo validation of cell culture experiments showing that ARF
transcription is blocked by DNTcf4 (14, 17). We therefore propose that
DNLef1 specifies tumor type by preventing h-catenin–dependent
induction of hair follicle genes and acts as a tumor promoter by
preventing accumulation of the tumor suppressor p53 (Fig. 4D).
