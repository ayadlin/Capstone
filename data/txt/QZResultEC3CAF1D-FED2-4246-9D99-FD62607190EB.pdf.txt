ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and therefore,
new and improved approaches for the treatment of breast cancer are desperately
needed. CtIP (RBBP8) is a multifunctional protein that is involved in various cellular
functions, including transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair and the G1 and G2
cell cycle checkpoints. CtIP plays an important role in homologous recombination
repair by interacting with tumor suppressor protein BRCA1. Here, we analyzed the
expression profile of CtIP by data mining using published microarray data sets. We
found that CtIP expression is frequently decreased in breast cancer patients, and
the patient group with low-expressing CtIP mRNA is associated with a significantly
lower survival rate. The knockdown of CtIP in breast cancer MCF7 cells reduced Rad51
foci numbers and enhanced g H2AX foci formation after g-irradiation, suggesting that
deficiency of CtIP decreases homologous recombination repair and delays DNA double
strand break repair.
To explore the effect of CtIP on PARP inhibitor therapy for breast cancer, CtIPdepleted MCF7 cells were treated with PARP inhibitor olaparib (AZD2281) or veliparib
(ABT-888). As in BRCA mutated cells, PARP inhibitors showed cytotoxicity to CtIPdepleted cells by preventing cells from repairing DNA damage, leading to decreased
cell viability. Further, a xenograft tumor model in mice with MCF7 cells demonstrated
significantly increased sensitivity towards PARP inhibition under CtIP deficiency. In
summary, this study shows that low level of CtIP expression is associated with poor
prognosis in breast cancer, and provides a rationale for establishing CtIP expression
as a biomarker of PARP inhibitor response, and consequently offers novel therapeutic
options for a significant subset of patients.

20 years in industrialized countries [1]. Therefore, the
development of mechanism-based, targeted combination
therapy that helps to improve disease-free survival and
overall survival of breast cancer patients is still a major
challenge.

Cells are continuously exposed to exogenous agents
and biological processes that create DNA damage, which,
if not repaired effectively and efficiently, can lead to
genomic instability or cell death [2]. Poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is an abundant nuclear enzyme that
synthesizes the poly(ADP-ribose) polymer when activated
by DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) [3]. Once single strand
break (SSB) and double strand break (DSB) damage of
DNA are produced, PARP-1 binds to the DNA and rapidly
recruits x-ray repair complementation group 1(XRCC1)
and tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) to the site of
damage to catalyze subsequent repair [4]. Repair of DSBs
can be undertaken by two main pathways: homologous
recombination (HR) repair (HRR) and non-homologous
end-joining (NHEJ) repair [5]. BRCA1 and BRCA2
proteins normally function as important components
of the HR pathway for the repair of DSBs. It has been
reported that PARP inhibition leads to accumulation of
DSBs by the failure of SSB repair and by replication fork
collapse, which in turn requires HR-mediated repair [6-8].
In addition to blocking PARP catalytic activity at SSBs,
PARP inhibitors can trap PARP enzyme at damaged DNA
to form PARP-DNA complexes, which are more cytoxic
[9]. PARP inhibition also leads to attenuation of alternative
end joining repair through suppression of DNA polymerase
θ recruitment [10, 11]. Cancers with BRCA1/2 mutations
are defective in HRR and are therefore hypersensitive
to PARP inhibitors [7]. Following this approach, recent
clinical trials for the treatment of BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient
breast and ovarian tumors using specific inhibitors targeting
PARP have been performed with the concept of ‘synthetic
lethality’ [4, 6, 12, 13]. However, whether synthetic
lethality is applicable to human cancers that have acquired
other mutations/deletions in DNA repair genes has not been
widely investigated.
Because CtIP (CtBP-interacting protein), which
functions in the initial step of HRR with NBS1 and
BRCA1 by acting as an end-resection enzyme to produce
3’-single stranded DNA, is known to be frequently
downregulated in breast cancers as well as in other types
of cancers, we focused on CtIP in this study and showed
that breast cancer cells with defects in CtIP function
are hypersensitive to the PARP inhibitors olaparib and
veliparib. Thus, PARP inhibitors have therapeutic potential
in the treatment of CtIP-deficient breast cancers, and our
results might extend the concept of synthetic lethality to
tumors bearing alterations in CtIP.

capped meiotic DSBs [15-20]. Therefore, we investigated
the relationship of CtIP expression in breast cancers and
their clinical outcome by using two publicly available
microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) database (GSE10780 [21] and GSE3744 [21])
that contain both normal and breast cancer samples.
CtIP expression levels were measured as log2 (probe
intensities) using Affymetrix microarrays. In both these
two datasets, the levels of CtIP mRNA in breast cancers
were statistically lower than those in normal breast tissues
(Fig.1A and Supplemental Fig.1A). Because patients
diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
have a higher risk of disease relapse within 5 years than
patients treated for other breast cancer subtypes [22],
we compared the CtIP mRNA level in TNBC to that in
non-TNBC by using one publicly available microarray
dataset (GSE47561 [23]). We found that CtIP expression
was significantly lower in triple negative breast cancer
(Fig.1B), which is consistent with the previous study
[24]. These results indicate that the expression level of
CtIP is decreased in breast cancers. Furthermore, CtIP
gene alterations were observed in several cancer types
with either mutation, deletion or copy number variation
(Supplemental Fig. 1C). However, the incidence of
deletion or mutation of CtIP was rather low in cancers.
We thus speculated that CtIP down-regulation might be
due to epigenetic or posttranscriptional regulation.
To determine the clinical impact of reduced CtIP
expression in human breast cancer, we assessed the
association between CtIP mRNA levels and clinical
outcome in three independent breast cancer cohorts
[25-27] with clinical information (GEO database). To
investigate the prognostic impact of CtIP expression in
breast cancer, breast cancer patients were categorized into
two groups based on CtIP mRNA expression. We found
that patients with cancers displaying low CtIP expression
levels had significantly shorter overall survival compared
to those with high CtIP (Fig. 1C-1D, Supplemental Figure
1B). Additionally, we confirmed the correlation between
CtIP expression and clinicopathological variables.
Clinical data from GEO dataset GSE3494 was used for
this analysis [25]. The samples pooled in the dataset
were divided into two groups according to the expression
level of CtIP in tumor tissue and χ 2 test was performed.
As shown in Table  1, low level of CtIP expression was
associated with p53 mutation (P=0.0025), PR status
(P=0.0312), larger tumor (P=0.0082) and lymph nodes
metastasis (P<0.0001). It is notable that there was an
association of high CtIP with low PR in dataset of
GSE3494, whereas no correlation was observed with ER
status and information of Her2 status was not available.
We calculated the data from publically available gene
expression profile (GSE10780, GSE47561, GSE3494
and GSE21653). Because these datasets did not include
detailed information about BRCA status, radiation therapy
or chemotherapy including use of PARP inhibitor, we
could not analyze the correlations between these factors

RESULTS
CtIP expression is frequently down-regulated in
breast cancers
CtIP association with BRCA1 facilitates HRR of
DSBs by initiating DNA resection [14]. Cells defective
in CtIP are highly sensitive to topoisomerase I/II poisons
and ionizing radiation (IR) and are unable to repair Spo11www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and low level of CtIP expression. As shown in the Table 1,
the low expression of CtIP is highly associated with
lymph nodes metastasis, which could be one of the reasons
for the low survival rate in CtIP low expression patients,
although we do not know the mechanism in details. We
further examined the correlation between CtIP expression
and clinical stage in breast cancer using the data from
GSE61304. Even though the expression of CtIP seemed to
be at a lower level in higher T stage, it was not statistically
significant (data not shown). Taken together, these findings
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggest that CtIP downregulation has a critical role in
overall patient survival.

Loss of CtIP results in DSB repair defect
HRR-mediated DSB repair is carried out in a series
of steps, the first step is nucleolytic processing, which
generates 3’ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails to initiate
strand invasion [28, 29]. The 3’ single-stranded stretch of
DNA is coated with a single-strand binding protein known
7704

Oncotarget

as replication protein A (RPA), which is in turn displaced
by RAD51 [30]. CtIP is reported to initiate 5’-strand end
resection to generate 3’-overhang, which is required for
the effective formation of the RPA-ssDNA complex [14].
This was further supported by a result from GSEA analysis
of human breast cancers (Supplemental Fig. 2A), showing
that at least 50% of the gene sets were associated with
DNA damage response and repair. Detection of γH2AX
has been suggested as a highly specific and sensitive
marker for monitoring DSB damage and resolution [31].
Therefore, we quantified γH2AX foci formation after CtIP
knockdown (Fig. 2A). As shown in Figure 2B and 2C,

one hour after IR, the number of γH2AX foci was almost
the same as at an early time point, but rather higher 24
hr later in CtIP-depleted MCF cells, when compared to
control MCF7 cells, which suggested that the efficiency
of DSB repair was reduced when CtIP was dysfunctional.
Further, we checked HRR efficiency by checking Rad51
foci, and we found that in CtIP-depleted MCF cells, the
number of Rad51 foci was significantly reduced 3 hrs after
4 Gy irradiation (Fig. 2D and 2E). These observations
suggest that without CtIP, DNA end resection is blocked
and DSBs cannot be repaired precisely and effectively
by HRR.

Loss of CtIP causes cells to be sensitive to PARP
inhibitors

53BP1 itself leads to sensitization to a PARP inhibitor, and
the loss of CtIP causes cells to be highly sensitive to a
PARP inhibitor, however, double loss of 53BP1 and CtIP
can result in resistance to a PARP inhibitor compared to
the loss of CtIP. This observation therefore substantiates
the finding that loss of CtIP is associated with sensitivity
towards PARP inhibition.

Because CtIP-depleted cells show HRR defect, they
are expected to be more sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Here,
we used two clinically used PARP inhibitors olaparib and
veliparib to examine this point. The result showed that
CtIP-depleted MCF7 cells indeed exhibited significantly
increased DNA damage after treatment with these PARP
inhibitors (Fig. 3A, 3B and Supplemental Fig. 3A and
B), which was consistent with the recent study in ovarian
cancer cells [32]. When we analyzed cell viability after
treatment with olaparib and veliparib, CtIP-depleted cells
showed decreased cell viability with MTT assay (Fig. 3C)
and in colony formation assay (Fig. 3D), which was similar
to BRCA1 deficient cells (Supplemental Fig. 3D and E)
[7, 33]. It was reported that in BRCA1 deficient cancer
cells, loss of 53BP1 leads to PARP inhibitor resistance
[34, 35], therefore we checked whether the loss of 53BP1
can also cause PARP inhibitor resistance in CtIP-depleted
cells. As shown in Fig. 3E and 3F, we found that loss of

CtIP loss results in increased PARP inhibitor
sensitivity in vivo
To assess the therapeutic effect of olaparib on CtIPdepleted cells in vivo, we investigated the ability of olaparib
to suppress the growth of a CtIP-depleted MCF7 cell linederived xenograft tumor. MCF7 or CtIP-depleted MCF7
cells were subcutaneously grafted into Balb/c nude mice.
Two days after transplantation, mice were treated daily with
olaparib or a vehicle. At day 3, olaparib treated two groups
(siControl (black line) and siCtIP (violet line)) showed
a slightly lower growth, compared to the group without
olaparib treatment (siControl (green line) and siCtIP (red

line)), although it was not statistically significant (Fig. 4A).
This decreased growth could be due to the effect of olaparib,
as we observed that the plating efficiency was slightly
decreased from 75% to 67 % in the presence of olaparib as

described in Fig. 3D legend. Sixteen days after treatment,
olaparib caused a clearly and statistically significant
inhibitory effect on tumor volume in CtIP-depleted MCF7
xenografts (Fig. 4A and 4B). The tumor weight was much

DISCUSSION

syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
(MDS/AML) [49]. All these findings reveal that CtIP plays
an important role in tumorigenesis.
In conclusion, CtIP is frequently downregulated
in breast cancer cells and our studies revealed that the
expression level of CtIP in breast cancer patients is
correlated with overall survival. Loss of CtIP results in
HRR defect, providing the rationale to investigate the
clinical significance of CtIP and its potential use as a
biomarker to the application of PARP inhibitors in breast
cancer treatment.

In recent years, several PARP inhibitors have
been developed and subjected to clinical trials for the
treatment of cancer [36-38]. Using PARP inhibitors as
the synthetic lethal approach represents a powerful new
strategy for therapeutic intervention [39, 40]. Recently
Lin et al. showed that CtIP knockdown sensitized
ovarian cancer cells to olaparib [32]. Here, we found
that CtIP-depleted breast cancer cells show enhanced
sensitivity to PARP inhibitors olaparib and veliparib.
In agreement with an underlying defect in DDR, siRNA
targeting CtIP caused a concomitant increase and
persistence in γH2AX formation and impaired DNA
damage-induced Rad51 foci formation. This suggested
that the cause of PARP inhibitor sensitivity in cells
depleted of CtIP might involve a defect in DNA endresection, which led to dysfunctional HR. We further
showed the double loss of 53BP1 and CtIP can result
in resistance to a PARP inhibitor compared to the loss
of CtIP. The CtIP deficiency caused severe HRR defect
probably at the initiation process, and the 53BP1
deficiency under CtIP knockdown condition may have
partially rescued HRR but have a defect in NHEJ repair.
This condition thus resulted in a slightly lower survival
compared with the 53BP1 deficiency alone, where
NHEJ is defective but HR is active. This observation is
consistent with the notion that 53BP1 cooperating with
RIF1 and PTIP promotes NHEJ repair [41] and thus
its absence negatively affects the sensitivity to a PARP
inhibitor in MCF-7 cells.
The human CtIP is a nuclear protein which is
widely expressed in various human tissues [42]. It is
phosphorylated upon DNA damage (possibly by ATM/
ATR), cooperates with the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex
and BRCA1 in processing DSB broken ends [14, 43,
44]. It promotes HR by initiating DSB end resection
and the formation of ssDNA [30]. Finally RAD51–
ssDNA nucleoprotein filament is formed to promote
strand invasion and HR. In the absence of BRCA1 or
CtIP, RAD51 binding to DSB sites and the HR process
are interfered with, resulting in mutagenic DNA repair,
genome instability, and tumorigenesis [45]. In CtIPdeficient mice, early embryonic lethality and shortened life
span are observed with the development of multiple types
of tumors [46]. Furthermore, CtIP deficiency was found
to be associated with a significantly increased mutation
rate in a screening study of colon cancers [47]. From a
mutation screening of the CtIP gene in 89 human tumor
cell lines, 5 missense and 11 silent mutations were found
[48]. Meanwhile, it has been reported that CtIP protein
level was frequently quite low in breast cancer cells,
especially in estrogen receptor negative breast cancers
[24]. Furthermore, a recent study showed that CtIP was
also widely mutated in patients with myelodysplastic

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
MCF7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS (Hyclone), 100 U/ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). All cells
were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5%
CO2.

Cell proliferation assay (MTT assay)
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicate
at densities of 5 × 103 per well. Cell proliferation was
monitored at desired time points. In brief, the MTT
assay was performed using a CCK-8 assay kit (Dojindo)
by adding 10 μl of CCK-8 reagent for 4 hrs. Light
absorbance of the solution was measured at 450 nm
with a reference of 600 nm, using a microplate reader
(TECAN).

Colony formation assay
MCF7 cells were seeded in triplicate in 6-cm dishes
in complete medium. After 10-14 days of growth, cells
were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and visible
colonies were counted to determine cell numbers in each
colony.

Western blot analysis
Cells at 90% confluency in the 6-cm dishes were
lysed in lysis buffer. Whole cell extracts were separated
by 10% sodium dodecylsulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electroblotted to
PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated
with appropriate primary antibodies diluted in 5% skim
milk (in PBS) overnight at 4°C. The membranes were
further incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hr at
room temperature. The membranes were then reacted
with a chemiluminescent reagent (Millipore) and
scanned using an Image Reader LAS-1000 Pro (Fuji
Film).

Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) site. The patients
were classified into two groups according to their CtIP
expression level (top 50%: high vs. bottom 50%: low)
and GSEA was carried out to assess the effects of CtIP
expression level on various biological activities using
these two classified data sets. One thousand random
sample permutations were carried out and significantly
enriched gene sets were identified, which produced a
nominal P-value < 0.05 and false discovery rates (FDR)
< 0.25.

For foci analysis, MCF7 cells were irradiated (4 Gy)
and left to recover for different times. Cells were incubated
with PARP inhibitors olaparib (Selleckchem) or veliparib
(Selleckchem) where indicated. Cells were fixed with 10%
formalin neutral buffer at room temperature for 15 min,
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS (phosphate
buffered saline) on ice for 5 min, blocked with 10% FBS/
PBS, and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in
10% FBS/PBS at room temperature for 1 hr. Primary
antibodies were detected by anti-mouse Alexa 488 or antirabbit Alexa 594 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes).
Nuclei were stained by 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). Immunofluorescence images were captured using
a Fluoview FV10i microscope (Olympus).

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of differences between
different groups was determined using the Studentʼs ttest. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate
survival curves for human patients. The log-rank test
and Wilcoxon test were used to compare the differences
between curves. The chi-square test was applied to
analyze the clinicopathological features of breast cancer.
The mutation counts and fraction of copy number
altered genome data for TCGA individuals were directly
downloaded from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics
(http://cbioportal.org).

siRNA transfection
Transfection with dsiRNA (Integrated DNA
Technologies) was carried out using Lipofectamine®
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) as recommended by the
manufacturers. Negative Control (DS NC1) siRNAs
were used as negative controls (Integrated DNA
Technologies). Human siCtIP target sequence is 5′GCTAAAACAGGAACGAATCTT-3′.

days after transplantation, mice were treated daily with
either a vehicle or 50 mg/kg bodyweight of olaparib
intraperitoneally. Tumor size was measured every 3 days
and calculated using the V=1/2(L X W2) formula. All
animal studies were performed in accordance with the
Guidelines for Animal Experiments of the National Cancer
Center, which meet the ethical guidelines for experimental
animals in Japan.

All images were captured at identical exposures
selected so as to avoid saturation at any individual focus.
Intra-nuclear foci were counted by hand from confocal
images. Foci from approximately 50 cells were scored for
each time point in 3 independent experiments.

The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
