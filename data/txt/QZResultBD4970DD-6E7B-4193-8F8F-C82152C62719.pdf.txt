Abstract
Checkpoint kinase Chk1 is constitutively active in many cancer cell types and new generation Chk1
inhibitors show marked antitumor activity as single agents. Here we present a hitherto unrecognized
mechanism that contributes to the response of cancer cells to Chk1-targeted therapy. Inhibiting chronic Chk1
activity in cancer cells induced the tumor suppressor activity of protein phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A
(PP2A), which by dephosphorylating MYC serine 62, inhibited MYC activity and impaired cancer cell survival.
Mechanistic investigations revealed that Chk1 inhibition activated PP2A by decreasing the transcription of
cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), a chief inhibitor of PP2A activity. Inhibition of cancer cell clonogenicity
by Chk1 inhibition could be rescued in vitro either by exogenous expression of CIP2A or by blocking the
CIP2A-regulated PP2A complex. Chk1-mediated CIP2A regulation was extended in tumor models dependent
on either Chk1 or CIP2A. The clinical relevance of CIP2A as a Chk1 effector protein was validated in several
human cancer types, including neuroblastoma, where CIP2A was identiﬁed as an NMYC-independent
prognostic factor. Because the Chk1–CIP2A–PP2A pathway is driven by DNA-PK activity, functioning
regardless of p53 or ATM/ATR status, our results offer explanative power for understanding how Chk1
inhibitors mediate single-agent anticancer efﬁcacy. Furthermore, they deﬁne CIP2A-PP2A status in cancer
cells as a pharmacodynamic marker for their response to Chk1-targeted therapy. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6757–69.

Introduction
Inhibition of phosphatase activity of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex is fundamental for transformation of immortalized human cells to malignant cancer cells
(1–3). Expression of the cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A)
has been proposed to be a potential mechanism for widespread inhibition of PP2A tumor suppressor activity in
human malignancies (2, 4). In line with its PP2A-inhibiting
activity, CIP2A promotes, among other PP2A target proteins
(5–7), expression of serine 62 phosphorylated MYC and
supports MYC-mediated gene transcription (4, 8). CIP2A
promotes human cell transformation (4), and is required
for xenograft tumor growth of several types of human cancer
cells (4, 9, 10). Moreover, hypomorphic CIP2A mouse model
(11) shows impaired MMTV-neu-driven mammary tumor
development and progression (7). Importantly, CIP2A overexpression is seen in over 70% of patient samples in almost
all cancer types studied thus far, and its expression correlates with clinical progression in a large variety of human
malignancies (4, 7, 9, 10, 12).
Recent studies have shown widespread activation of several DNA damage response (DDR) proteins in human cancers (13, 14). Among the DDR proteins that are activated
in cancer cells in the absence of any DNA-damaging

treatments, Chk1 and DNA-PK have been recently identiﬁed
to be required for tumor growth (13, 15–20). Notably, recent
studies have shown that Chk1 activity is required for MYCinduced tumorigenesis (15, 16, 18). Moreover, even though
Chk1 haploinsufﬁciency was shown to modestly promote
tumorigenesis in combination with certain oncogenic
lesions (17, 21, 22), 2 recent studies provide genetic evidence
that Chk1 may beneﬁt tumor development (17, 23). Together
with studies using either RNAi-based or chemical inhibition
of Chk1 (13, 15–20), these results demonstrate that in the
context of transformed cells, Chk1 activity promotes cell
viability (13, 14, 24). However, even though induction of
mitotic catastrophe explains cell-killing activity of Chk1
inhibitors when used in combination with DNA-damaging
agents (13, 14, 24), mechanisms by which chronic Chk1
activity in unperturbed cancer cells promotes their viability
and clonogenicity are very poorly understood. Moreover,
even though ATR kinase is a well-established upstream
activator of Chk1 when DNA replication is impeded (14),
or when cells are treated with DNA-damaging agents
(14, 22), we do not understand the mechanisms driving
chronic Chk1 activity in unperturbed human cancer cells.
In this study, we demonstrate that chronic Chk1 activity in
unperturbed cancer cells promotes CIP2A transcription and
thereby inhibits PP2A tumor suppressor activity. Furthermore,
our data shows that CIP2A downregulation and subsequent
increase in PP2A activity is essential for maximal inhibition of
cancer cell viability and clonogenicity in response to Chk1
inhibition.

dehyde and subjected to immunostaining with antibody
against proliferation marker Ki67 (Zymed, rabbit polyconal).
The immunostained cells were analyzed by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy and the percentages of cells expressing Ki67
were scored from each assay.
In vitro kinase assays
For in vitro kinase assays, MKN-28 cells were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer. Beads were removed by centrifugation, and DNA-PKc was immunoprecipitated from the
supernatants using the DNA-PKc (G4) antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Kinase assay was then carried out for 15
minutes at 30 C by mixing 30 mL of immunoprecipitated
sample, Chk1 (100 ng; c0870; Sigma) and ATP (50 mmol/L
ﬁnal concentration) and samples were incubated for 15
minutes at 30 C. Then 30 mL of 2 sample buffer was added
and samples heated for 5 minutes at 95 C and then immunoblotted for phospho-Chk1-serine345 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Chk1 rabbit polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and DNA-PKc antibodies.
Statistical analysis
Overall survival was calculated from date of diagnosis to
death. Associations between protein expression of the studied
biomarkers (CIP2A, Chk-1, c-MYC, and Claspin) were assessed
by Fisher exact test according to the Monte Carlo method at
the 99% conﬁdence level (IBM SPSS Statistics, version 19.0 for
Mac; SPSS, Inc., an IBM Company). All statistical tests were
two-sided. Student t test was two-sided.

Materials and Methods
Cell viability assay
One day before transfection of siRNAs AGS, MKN-28 and
MDA-MB231 cells were seeded in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at a density of 1  103 to 2 
103 cells per well in 96-well plates. The cells were transfected
with the following conditions: medium only, Lipofectamine
2000 reagent only, or 20 nmol/L of indicated siRNAs (with
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent) in 200 mL of RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Subsequently, relative
numbers of viable cells were measured by ﬂuorescence at the
544 and 590 nm wavelengths in a FLUOstar OPTIMA Microplate Reader (BMG Labtech, Inc.), using the resazurin-based
CellTiter-Blue Assay (Promega Corporation) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
MCF10A MycER culture and cell-cycle analysis
MCF10A MycER cells were cultured as described previously
(25) in human mammary epithelial cell basal growth media
MCDB 170 (US Biological) with supplements. For cell-cycle
analysis, the cells were seeded on glass coverslips and allowed
to attach overnight. Next day, normal growth medium was
replaced with medium lacking EGF and insulin and the cells
were starved for 24 hours in the presence or either dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) or Chk1 inhibitor SB218078. To activate
MycER, 4-OHT (or ethanol as vehicle control) was added to
the cells, which were ﬁxed 24 hours later with 4% paraformal-

Results
Coexpression and prognostic role of CIP2A and Chk1 in
human malignancies
CIP2A is involved in gastric cancer progression (12).
Analysis of tissue microarray of human gastric carcinoma
specimens for Chk1 and for Claspin, the latter being a Chk1
scaffold protein that promotes Chk1 activity (14), demonstrated that Chk1 and Claspin were expressed in 162 of 195
(83.2%) and 163 of 199 (81.9%) specimens, respectively (Fig.
1A and B). Moreover, a statistically signiﬁcant association
between Chk1 and Claspin expression levels was observed
(Fig. 1B). Cancer selective expression of Chk1 mRNA in
gastric carcinoma versus normal samples was validated
using the Oncomine database (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Notably, CIP2A expression was signiﬁcantly associated with
expression of both Chk1 and Claspin (Fig. 1C and D). In
addition, a signiﬁcant association between Chk1 and CIP2A
expression was detected at the mRNA level in human
ovarian and colon cancer tissue samples (Supplementary
Fig. S1B and S1C). On the basis of recent identiﬁcation of
Chk1 as a drug target candidate in human neuroblastomas
(20), we mined genomic analysis of 88 neuroblastoma samples (26) for expression of both Chk1 and CIP2A. Similar to
gastric, ovarian, and colon cancers (Fig. 1C and D and
Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C), a statistically signiﬁcant
correlation was observed between the mRNA expression of

Chk1 and that of CIP2A in neuroblastomas (Fig. 1E). Importantly, in addition to their coexpression, Kaplan–Meier
analysis for both Chk1 and CIP2A demonstrated a signiﬁcant
decrease in overall (Fig. 1F) and relapse-free (Supplementary
Fig. S1D and S1E) survival in neuroblastoma patients with
high expression of either of these genes. Importantly, CIP2A
expression and relationship between Chk1 and CIP2A in
neuroblastoma is independent on NMYC ampliﬁcation status, a known major prognostic factor in this disease (Fig. 1G
and H). These results indicate that low CIP2A expression
could be used as a novel NMYC-independent marker of
neuroblastoma patients with favorable prognosis. Together,
these results demonstrate coexpression of Chk1 and CIP2A
in several human cancer types and indicate that understanding of the functional relevance of their coexpression would
be of clinical importance.
Chk1 activity promotes CIP2A expression in tumors
To determine whether coexpression of Chk1 and CIP2A is
because of their functional effects on each other, both proteins
were depleted from gastric cancer cells using 2 independent
siRNAs. Although CIP2A depletion did not affect Chk1 expression, inhibition of Chk1 either by siRNA (Fig. 2A–C and F) or
€
by small molecule inhibitors (SB218078 and GO6796;
Fig. 2D
and E; Supplementary Fig. S2A) potently decreased CIP2A
mRNA and protein expression. Inhibition of Chk1 kinase
€
activity by SB218078 and GO6796,
or by RNAi, was conﬁrmed
by decreased phosphorylation of direct Chk1 target site serine216 on Cdc25c (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Two different
siRNAs speciﬁc for Claspin also inhibited CIP2A protein
expression (Supplementary Fig. S2C). A positive role for Chk1
in promoting CIP2A expression was observed in a large variety
of cancer cell lines, independent of their p53 status (Fig. 2A
and B; Supplementary Fig. S2D–S2F). CIP2A downregulation
by Chk1 inhibition is unlikely to be caused by inhibition cellcycle activity, as CIP2A expression does not signiﬁcantly
change in synchronized versus unsynchronized AGS and
MKN-28 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3E). Accordingly,
CIP2A expression is not associated with serum-induced cellcycle progression in AGS cells (12), and synchronization of
HeLa cells by serum starvation did not impact CIP2A protein
expression (Supplementary Fig. S3F–S3H).
In concert with Chk1's role in transcription regulation
(27, 28), Chk1 was found to regulate CIP2A at mRNA level
(Fig. 2D and F; Supplementary Fig. S4A), and Chk1 inhibition
reduced luciferase activity of CIP2A promoter/luciferase
reporter (ref. 29; Fig. 2G). However, inhibition by Chk1
inhibitors did not generally inhibit transcriptional activity,
because c-Jun-driven AP-1 promoter activity was not affected (Fig. 2G).
We have recently shown that Chk1 inhibitor PF-477736
signiﬁcantly inhibits human neuroblastoma tumor growth by
using xenograft model (20). To conﬁrm that Chk1 activity
promotes CIP2A expression also in vivo, in a model that is
dependent on Chk1 activity, mice carrying neuroblastoma
xenografts were treated with the Chk1 inhibitor PF-477736,
and CIP2A mRNA expression was studied 48 hours after
treatment. Indeed, CIP2A mRNA expression was decreased by

6760

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

45% in neuroblastoma tumors in vivo by PF-477736 compared
with vehicle control (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Again, analysis
of control genes expression from the same tumor samples
indicated that Chk1 inhibition did not result in general inhibition of transcription (Supplementary Fig. S4C). We recently
demonstrated that CIP2A hypomorph mouse model displays
reduced MMTV-neu–induced mammary tumorigenesis (7).
CIP2A expression was positively regulated by Chk1 also in this
CIP2A-dependent tumor model, as Chk1 inhibition by systemic
PF-477736 treatment inhibited CIP2A mRNA expression in
MMTV-neu mammary tumors (Fig. 2H). Together these results
demonstrate inhibition of CIP2A expression by Chk1-targeted
cancer therapy in vivo.
Inhibition of CIP2A expression deﬁnes cellular response
to Chk1 inhibition
Importantly, depletion of either Chk1 or Claspin decreased
the viability of AGS cells (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S4E).
In concert with p53 independent role for Chk1 in regulation
of CIP2A expression (Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary Fig. S2D–
S2F), Chk1 RNAi inhibited also viability of 2 p53 mutant cancer
cell lines, MKN-28 (gastric cancer; Fig. 3B), and MDA-MB-231
(breast cancer; Fig. 3C). Inhibition of both Chk1 and Claspin
also inhibited colony growth of AGS cells (Fig. 3D and E).
Moreover, the growth of AGS cell colonies was dependent on
Chk1 kinase activity, as demonstrated by experiments using 2
small molecule inhibitors of Chk1 (Fig. 3F). Finally, the anchorage-independent growth of gastric cancer cells was also signiﬁcantly decreased by 2 different small hairpin RNAs speciﬁc
for Chk1 (Fig. 3G) and by small molecule Chk1 inhibitor
SB218078 (Supplementary Fig. S4F and S4G). Therefore, Chk1
activity supports viability and clonogenicity of the same cell
lines in which it promotes CIP2A expression, and in which
CIP2A promotes cell viability and tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. S4D; refs. 4, 9, 12).
Notably, exogenous expression of CIP2A (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4H) increased AGS cell viability in scrambled siRNA-transfected cells, and rescued in large both inhibition of CIP2A levels and cell viability in Chk1 siRNA treated
cells (Fig. 4A and B). Statistical analysis of difference in
relative cell viability between cells transfected with either
control plasmid, or with CIP2AFlag, demonstrated that
CIP2A protein expression levels deﬁne the response of these
cells to RNAi-mediated Chk1 inhibition (Fig. 4A). These
ﬁndings were again replicated in 2 p53 mutant cell lines
(Fig. 4C–E; Supplementary Fig. S4I). Importantly, in addition
to short-term cell viability effects, exogenous CIP2A expression also signiﬁcantly inhibited Chk1 and Claspin siRNA
effects in a clonogenicity assay in AGS cells (Fig. 4F).
As an independent approach to demonstrate relevance of
CIP2A regulation for therapeutic response to Chk1 inhibition,
we assessed Chk1 inhibitor effects on CIP2A expression and
viability regulation in an immortalized human prostate cell line
PNT2 (30) that we have recently identiﬁed as a rare cell line,
whose viability is not inhibited by CIP2A-targeted siRNA
(unpublished results). Interestingly, as compared with one of
the CIP2A-dependent cell lines, AGS, inhibition of Chk1 activity
in PNT2 cells did not result in inhibition of CIP2A expression

treatment (Fig. 4H).
Together, these results strongly indicate inhibition of CIP2A
expression as a decisive mechanism whether cell viability is
impaired in response to Chk1 inhibition.

Chk1-Targeted Therapy Reactivates PP2A in Cancer Cells

Supplementary Fig. S5A). However, neither Chk1 nor CIP2A
siRNA inhibited MYC mRNA expression, conﬁrming posttranscriptional regulation of MYC (Supplementary Fig. S5B). We
have previously shown that CIP2A expression levels positively
correlate with MYC protein expression in gastric cancer (12).
Importantly, in the same tumor material, also Chk1 and
nuclear MYC protein were found to be coexpressed (Supplementary Table S1).
To examine whether Chk1 activity contributes to MYCmediated proliferation, we used conditional MYC-ER expressing MCF-10A cells that after serum starvation are driven to
MYC-induced cell-cycle progression by nuclear translocation of MYC-ER fusion protein in response to tamoxifen
treatment (25). Similar to endogenous MYC, serine 62 phosphorylation of MYC-ER was also inhibited by SB218078,
along with CIP2A downregulation (Fig. 5D), whereas in
accordance with posttranslational mechanism of MYC regulation by CIP2A, total MYC-ER expression was not affected
(Supplementary Fig. S5C). Intriguingly, SB218078-elicited
inhibition of CIP2A expression and MYC serine 62 phosphorylation was accompanied by total loss of MYC-induced
proliferation of growth factor deprived cells, as measured by
the number of Ki67 and histone 3 phosphorylation (ser-10)
positive cells, 24 hours after tamoxifen application (Fig. 5E;
Supplementary Fig. S5D).
To further validate the assumption that Chk1 promotes
MYC activity through CIP2A, we identiﬁed sets of genes that
are coexpressed with CIP2A or Chk1 (absolute Spearman
correlation r, P < 1010, t-distribution) in the neuroblastoma
database (26), and assessed whether MYC target genes would
be particularly enriched among genes that associated with
CIP2A and Chk1. The CIP2A and Chk1 associated expression
proﬁles (Supplementary Table S2) were highly positively correlated (r, P < 1011), which further implies a functional link
between them. Importantly, MYC target genes comprised
almost one-fourth of the 168 genes that were associated with
CIP2A and Chk1 and thus showed very signiﬁcant enrichment
(39 shared MYC targets, P < 1010, hypergeometric
distribution; Fig. 5F). Among the Chk1 and CIP2A correlating
MYC targets, SKP2 is an independently validated direct MYC
target that mediates MYC's proliferative activity (31, 32).
Signiﬁcant inhibition of SKP2 gene expression was validated
in AGS cells transfected with both Chk1 and CIP2A siRNAs
(Fig. 5G).
We recently showed that depletion of PP2A complex Bsubunit PPP2R2A reversed CIP2A RNAi effects on proliferation,
and on regulation of MYC target genes (8). Therefore, to ﬁnally
link CIP2A, PP2A, and MYC to Chk1-regulated clonogenicity,
we assessed whether depletion of PPP2R2A could reverse
effects of Chk1 RNAi. Indeed, cells that were depleted of
PPP2R2A (Supplementary Fig. S5E) were relatively resistant
to inhibition of colony growth by Chk1 siRNA (Fig. 5H and I).
Identiﬁcation of DNA-PK as upstream mediator of Chk1
serine 345 phosphorylation and CIP2A expression in
unperturbed cancer cells
Upon acutely induced DNA-damage, Chk1 is phosphorylated on both serines 317 and 345 via ATM/ATR-mediated

mechanisms (14, 22). However, the mechanisms supporting
serine 345 phosphorylation in cancer cells in the absence of
DNA-damaging agents are not yet understood. Importantly, a
recent study demonstrated a fundamental difference between
the biological consequences of phosphorylation of Chk1 on
either serine 317 or 345 (33). In agreement with the requirement of Chk1 serine 345 phosphorylation for cell viability in
unperturbed conditions (33), in exponentially growing AGS
cells, Chk1 was constitutively phosphorylated on serine 345,
whereas serine 317 phosphorylation was hardly detected under
these conditions (Fig. 6A). Constitutive serine 345 Chk1 staining was speciﬁc, as demonstrated by the loss of positive
staining for phosphorylated serine 345 on Chk1 in cells transfected with 2 individual siRNAs targeting Chk1 (Supplementary
Fig. S5F). When excessive DNA damage was induced by camptothecin treatment, however, ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation of serine 317 at Chk1 was observed (Fig. 6A). In line with
previously published results (14, 22), induction of DNA damage
by camptothecin also increased Chk1 serine 345 phosphorylation, and this DNA-damage–induced serine 345 phosphorylation of Chk1 was sensitive to ATM/ATR inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S5G). However, although camptothecin-induced
phosphorylation of both serines 317 and 345 of Chk1 were
effectively blocked by treatment with chemical ATM/ATR
inhibitor (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S5G), neither Chk1
serine 345 phosphorylation (Fig. S5H), expression of CIP2A,
or expression of serine 62 phosphorylated MYC (Fig. 6B) were
affected by treatment with the ATM/ATR inhibitor in unperturbed cells. Furthermore, CIP2A expression was not affected
by siRNA-mediated inhibition of ATM/ATR expression in
either MKN-28 (Fig. 6C) or HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig.
S5I). Together these results conﬁrm involvement of different
regulatory mechanisms of serine 345 phosphorylation of Chk1
between unperturbed cells, and cells in which excessive DNA
damage has been induced. Furthermore, these results strongly
indicate that constitutive Chk1 serine 345 phosphorylation,
and Chk1-mediated regulation of CIP2A, occurs via an ATM/
ATR-independent mechanism.
Therefore, we examined whether a different DDR kinase was
involved. The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) transduces DNA-damage responses and directly phosphorylates
Chk2 (34), making it a plausible candidate to mediate also
Chk1 phosphorylation. Importantly, DNA-PKc inhibition, by
either the speciﬁc small molecule inhibitor DMNB(DNA-PKi),
or by DNA-PKc speciﬁc siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S5J),
inhibited expression of serine 345 phosphorylated Chk1 (Fig.
6D). Moreover, in an in vitro kinase assay, DNA-PKc immunoprecipitated from MKN-28 cells was capable of phosphorylating recombinant Chk1 on serine 345, identifying DNA-PKc as
Chk1 serine 345 kinase (Fig. 6E). Inhibition of DNA-PK by either
DNA-PKi or by RNAi inhibited the expression of CIP2A (Fig. 6F;
Supplementary Fig. S5K) and, similar to inhibition of Chk1 (Fig.
5C) and CIP2A (Supplementary Fig. S5A; refs. 4, 8, 10, 12), DNAPKc inhibition also inhibited the expression of serine 62
phosphorylated MYC (Fig. 6G). Together these results indicate
that in unperturbed cancer cells, DNA-PKc activity supports
Chk1 serine 345 phosphorylation and CIP2A expression. However, our data does not exclude other unidentiﬁed active

Chk1-Targeted Therapy Reactivates PP2A in Cancer Cells

tive of p53 status. Importantly, in addition to in vitro data, we
also present signiﬁcant evidence indicating that Chk1–CIP2A–
MYC pathway functions in vivo in tumors. These data include
demonstration of coexpression of Chk1, CIP2A, and MYC in
human tumors as well as prognostic role of both Chk1 and
CIP2A in the same tumor type. Moreover, we show that among
the genes whose expression is signiﬁcantly associated with
Chk1 and CIP2A expression in human tumors, MYC target
genes are signiﬁcantly overpresented. Finally, we show that in
in vivo tumors that are dependent on either Chk1 or CIP2A
expression, inhibition of Chk1 activity by small molecules in
clinical development results in inhibition of CIP2A transcription. In future, it would be of great interest to use genetically
modiﬁed mouse models to assess the degree by which PP2A
inhibition contributes to in vivo tumor response to single-agent
Chk1 inhibition. It is anticipated that high CIP2A expression, or
loss of PP2A B-subunit PPP2R2A observed recently in human
breast cancer (36), would induce relative resistance to Chk1
inhibitors because of lack of induction of PP2A tumor suppressor activity.
Our results strongly indicate that constitutive serine 345
phosphorylation of Chk1 promotes CIP2A expression and
cancer cell viability in unperturbed conditions. Association of
Chk1 serine 345 phosphorylation with increased cell viability is
strongly supported in the recent study by Bunz and colleagues
demonstrating that, although serine 317 phosphorylation of
Chk1 is not relevant to cell viability or proliferation in unperturbed conditions, mutated serine 345 did not support viability
(33). Moreover, a recent study showed that constitutive phosphorylation of serine 345 was observed in human neuroblastoma cell lines derived only from high-risk primary tumors (20).
Consequently, only the cell lines expressing serine 345 phosphorylated Chk1 were highly sensitive to small molecule Chk1
inhibitors also used in this study (20). Association of high Chk1
serine 345 phosphorylation with increased malignancy of
cancer cells perfectly corroborates the ﬁndings that CIP2A
expression associates with increased tumor grade and poor

signaling mechanisms that may contribute to Chk1 serine 345
phosphorylation and activity in unperturbed cancer cells.

Discussion
New generation small molecule inhibitors of Chk1 demonstrate single-agent therapeutic activity in several preclinical cancer models (13, 15, 16, 18–20). However, most of our
current knowledge related to regulation and functional role
of Chk1 has been acquired from experiments in which DNA
damage has been induced acutely in combination with Chk1
inhibition (14, 22, 24, 35). When Chk1 is inhibited in this
context, inability to repair the damaged DNA leads to
cellular crisis and massive apoptosis (14, 24). This synthetic
lethal interaction between DNA damage induction and Chk1
inhibition have served as the dogmatic model to explain
nononcogene addiction of malignant cells to Chk1 activity
(14, 24, 35). However, our understanding of the mechanisms,
which contribute to single-agent activity of Chk1-targeted
therapies in cancer cells with continuous Chk1 phosphorylation, is very limited.
In this study, we reveal hitherto unrecognized downstream
mechanism by which chronic Chk1 activity promotes cancer
cell viability and clonogenicity. Our results demonstrate that
inhibition of Chk1 activity inhibits expression of human oncoprotein CIP2A, which in turn results in reactivation of PP2A
tumor suppressor activity (Fig. 7). Importantly, results of
several experiments demonstrate that CIP2A expression levels
deﬁne cellular response to Chk1 inhibition in vitro. CIP2A
dependency of Chk1-regulated phenotypes was evidenced both
at the level of regulation of PP2A activity (Fig. 5B) and cell
viability (Fig. 4A–F). As a proof-of-principle functional target
for this newly identiﬁed pathway, we show that both MYC
serine 62 phosphorylation and MYC activity are regulated by
Chk1 and CIP2A (Fig. 5C–G). General applicability of Chk1dependent regulation of CIP2A expression and the functional
relevance of this regulation was conﬁrmed by using several cell
lines derived from different types of human cancers irrespec-

Figure 7. In unperturbed cancer
cells, DNA-PK activity promotes
constitutive Chk1 serine 345
phosphorylation and CIP2A
expression. Left, constitutively
active Chk1 together with Claspin
promotes CIP2A gene
transcription and protein
expression. CIP2A in turn inhibits
PP2A tumor suppressor activity
and thereby increases activity/
expression of oncogenic PP2A
targets (such as MYC). Right,
inhibition of the Chk1 activity by
means of cancer therapy results
in increase in PP2A activity,
dephosphorylation of PP2A target
proteins, and inhibition of cancer
cell viability. Inactive molecules

The upstream mechanisms promoting serine 345 phosphorylation in unperturbed cells have been elusive. Even though
ATR kinase mediates serine 345 phosphorylation of Chk1
under acute DNA damage conditions (refs. 14, 22; Supplementary Fig. S5G), inhibition of ATR did not affect expression
of CIP2A or serine 62 phosphorylated MYC (Fig. 6B and C;
Supplementary S5I). Instead, we identify another member of
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase family of
DNA damage response kinases, DNA-PK, as a strong candidate
for mediating Chk1 serine 345 phosphorylation in unperturbed conditions. We also show that DNA-PK inhibition either
by RNAi or by small molecule inhibitor recapitulates Chk1dependent regulation of CIP2A expression and MYC serine 62
phosphorylation (Fig. 6F and G; Supplementary S5J and S5K).
Altogether, these results provide novel insights for understanding the upstream mechanisms of chronic Chk1 activity in
unperturbed cancer cells.
PP2A inactivation is a universal characteristic of cancer cells
(1–3). Thereby, identiﬁcation of novel link between DNA
damage signaling and PP2A inhibition in malignant cells
fosters our general understanding of constitutively active
signaling circuits in cancer cells (Fig. 7). Considering the
plethora of phosphoproteins regulated by PP2A (37), we postulate that in addition to MYC serine 62 phosphorylation, other
oncogenic PP2A targets will be identiﬁed in future to be
regulated by Chk1-driven CIP2A expression in human malignancies. Supporting this, MYC-independent but PP2A-dependent CIP2A target mechanisms and proteins have been recently identiﬁed (5–8). Therefore, our data does not exclude that
other CIP2A-regulated PP2A targets than MYC would be
involved in inhibition of cell viability in Chk1-inhibited cancer
cells (Fig. 7). As a matter of fact, function of CIP2A as an
inhibitor of broad-speciﬁcity serine/threonine phosphatase
complex PP2A (37) most likely explains how expression status
of only one gene, CIP2A, may deﬁne functional outcome of
Chk1 inhibition in unperturbed cancer cells in vitro.
Clinically, results of this work may help in understanding the
molecular basis of poor response of cancer patients to Chk1
inhibitor monotherapy. Moreover, our results indicate that

assessment of transcriptional effects of Chk1 inhibition may
unveil novel biomarkers of tumor response to Chk1 inhibitors.
However, based on our results, it is plausible that reactivation
of PP2A, by targeting of CIP2A, or by other means, would be
therapeutically beneﬁcial in cancers that are dependent on
chronic Chk1 activity.
