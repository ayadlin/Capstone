ABSTRACT
Exosomes are nanosize vesicles released from cancer cells containing microRNAs
that can influence gene expression in target cells. Curcumin has been shown to exhibit
antitumor activities in a wide spectrum of human cancer. The addition of Curcumin,
to Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) cells, caused a dose-dependent increase
of PTEN, target of miR-21. Curcumin treatment also decreased AKT phosphorylation
and VEGF expression and release. Colony formation assays indicated that Curcumin
affects the survival of CML cells. Some observation suggest a possible cellular disposal
of miRNAs by exosomes. To elucidate if Curcumin caused a decrease of miR-21 in
CML cells and its packaging in exosomes, we analyzed miR-21 content in K562 and
LAMA84 cells and exosomes, after treatment with Curcumin. Furthermore, we showed
that addition of Curcumin to CML cells caused a downregulation of Bcr-Abl expression
through the cellular increase of miR-196b.
The effects of Curcumin was then investigated on a CML xenograft in SCID mice.
We observed that animals treated with Curcumin, developed smaller tumors compared
to mice control. Real time PCR analysis showed that exosomes, released in the plasma
of the Curcumin-treated mice, were enriched in miR-21 with respect control. Taken
together, our results suggested that a selective packaging of miR-21 in exosomes
may contribute to the antileukemic effect of Curcumin in CML.

vesicles of endocytic origin that are released by most
cell types when multivesicular bodies (MVBs) fuse
with the plasma membrane [4]. Originally described as
vesicles to discard transferrin receptor in erythrocytes
differentiation [5], exosomes are now considered as
molecular messengers with the potential to modulate
intercellular communication and tumor microenvironment
[6], promoting angiogenesis [7], tumor development
and formation of metastasis [8]. Several reports suggest
that exosomes contain miRNAs that can influence gene
expression in target cells thus modulating their behavior.
Molecular profiling analyses have revealed that exosomes

BACKGROUND
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized
by the clonal expansion of myeloid precursors. The t(9;22)
(q34.1;q11.21) translocation, occurring in approximately
95% of all CML patients, is considered the hallmark of
CML and generates the chimeric BCR-ABL gene [1].
The Bcr-Abl oncoprotein constitutively activates
several downstream pathways, responsible for the
induction of cellular proliferation, loss of adhesion,
blockage of cellular differentiation, and inhibition of
programmed cell death [2, 3]. Exosomes are nanosize

of different cellular origin contain a unique expression
profile of mRNAs and miRNAs, which may differ from
the signatures of their parent cells. MiRNAs with tumorsuppressor function are often lost in cancer [9], moreover
it has been demonstrated a possible cellular disposal role
of miRNAs by exosomes [10]. In our previous paper,
we showed that exosomes released by CML cell lines
such as LAMA84 cells transport miRNAs. In particular,
we demonstrated that miR-126 shuttled by exosomes is
biologically active in target cells and modulates tumorendothelial crosstalk occurring in the bone marrow
microenvironment [6, 7].
Polyphenols such as Curcuminoids affect the
expression of miRNAs, both in vitro and in vivo [11].
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) the main active polyphenol
extracted from the rhizomes of turmeric (Curcuma
longa) inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, migration,
angiogenesis, and inflammation and induces cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis in several cancers [12, 13]. Target
analysis of miRNA expression revealed that Curcumin
down-regulates the expression of pro-oncogenic
miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-21, and miR-27a in human
colo-rectal carcinoma cell lines. This miRNA expression
profile was associated with increased apoptosis, decreased
cell proliferation, and tumor invasion in vitro [14, 15].
Mudduluru et al [15] showed that Curcumin suppresses
tumor growth and metastasis in colorectal cancer through
downregulation of miR-21, a microRNA often found
overexpressed in several cancers. Difluorinated Curcumin
(CDF), a nontoxic analog of the dietary ingredient
Curcumin has been shown to modulate the expression of
miR-21 and PTEN in pancreatic cancer [16].
MiR-21 regulates tumor growth, invasion and
metastasis by targeting multiple tumor suppressor genes
such as PTEN [17]. PTEN is one of the most frequently
mutated or silenced tumor suppressors in human cancer;
PTEN antagonizes the PI3K-AKT pathway [18] and is
known to modulate VEGF mediated angiogenesis via the
down-regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in many solid
tumors [19]. Studies have shown that PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway is activated in numerous leukemia cell lines and
myeloid leukemia patients together with a decrease in the
expression of PTEN gene and/or protein [20]. PTEN has
a critical role in the pathogenesis of BCR-ABL-mediated
leukemogenesis and myeloproliferative disorders [21].
MiR-196b is another microRNA, closely associated
with leukaemia. It has been shown that miR-196b
was downregulated in EB-3 cells and in patients with
B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL). In contrast,
miR-196b was found over-expressed in patients with acute
myeloid leukaemia (AML) [22]. Little is known on the
role of miR-196b in CML. The expression of miR-196b
is lower in CML patients than in healthy individuals.
Interestingly, using a bioinformatic approach, Bcr-Abl has
been identified as target of miR-196b, and low expression

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

levels of miR-196b, were correlated with up-regulation of
the oncogene BCR-ABL1 [23].
Curcumin is a promising compound that in
association with classical tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
may improve the treatment of CML patients resistant
to Imatinib, the election drug for this leukemia [24].
In this study, we show in in vitro and in vivo models that
treatment of CML cells with Curcumin caused a miR-21mediated modulation of PTEN/AKT pathway leading to
the inhibition of leukemic cell growth. On the other hand,
Curcumin induced the up-regulation of miR-196b and a
decrease of BCR-ABL at mRNA and protein level.
We suggest that in CML, Curcumin probably
acts through an enhanced disposal of miR-21 in
exosomes and that this mechanism may contribute to the
antileukemic effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
K562 and LAMA84 (DMSZ, Braunschweig,
Germany) chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Euroclone, UK)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Euroclone, UK), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Euroclone, UK). All other
reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO,
USA), if not otherwise cited. In some experiments K562
and LAMA84 cells were treated with 1 μM GW4869, a
specific neutral sphingomyelinase 2 inhibitor, also known
as an inhibitor of exosomes release [25].

Proliferation assay (MTT assay)
Methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) assay was done
as previously described [26]; cells were plated in triplicate
at 2 × 105 per well and treated with Curcumin (5–40 μM)
for 24 hours. Means and standard deviations generated
from three independent experiments are reported as the
percentage of viable cells.

Exosomes isolation
Exosomes released by K562 and LAMA84 cells
treated or not with Curcumin (20 and 40 μM) during
a 24 h culture period, were isolated from culture
medium supplemented with 10% FBS (previously
ultracentrifuged) by different centrifugations as
previously described [7, 27] and isolated vesicles
were purified on a 30% sucrose/D2O cushion. Vesicles
contained in the sucrose cushion were recovered,
washed, and ultracentrifuged for 90 min in PBS
and collected for use. Exosome protein content was
determined with the Bradford method.

and BCR-ABL transcript levels were measured by TaqMan
Real Time PCR, using TaqMan gene expression assay for
PTEN (Hs00262123 m1), VEGF (Hs0090005.m1) and
VEGF (Hs0090005.m1) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
California, USA). Data were analyzed as previously
described. Changes in the target mRNA content relative
to GAPDH were determined using the comparative Ct
method as described in the previous paragraph.

Exosome size distribution was determined by DLS
experiments. Exosome samples were diluted 30 times
to avoid inter-particle interaction and placed at 20°C
in a thermostated cell compartment of a Brookhaven
Instruments BI200-SM goniometer, equipped with a
solid-state laser tuned at 532 nm. Scattered intensity
autocorrelation functions g2(t) were measured by using a
Brookhaven BI-9000 correlator and analyzed in order to
determine the distribution P(D) of the diffusion coefficient
D by using a constrained regularization method or
alternatively a gamma distribution. The size distribution,
namely the distribution of hydrodynamic diameter Dh, was
derived by using the Stokes-Einstein relation: D = (kBT)/
(3πη Dh), where D is the diffusion coefficient, kB is the
Boltzman constant, η is the medium viscosity and T is
the temperature. The mean hydrodynamic diameter of
exosomes was calculated by fitting a Gaussian function to
the measured size distribution.

Transfection of K562 and LAMA84 cells with
miR-21 mimic or inhibitor
Transfection of miScript miR-21 inhibitor
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) or miScript miR-21
mimic in CML cells (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was
performed according Fast-Forward Transfection protocol
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). 6 × 104 K562 and LAMA84
cells per well were seeded in a 24-well plate in 500 μl of
RPMI. miScript miR-21 (2′-O-Me-miR-21) or miScript
miR-21 mimic (2 μM) were diluted in 100 μl culture
medium without serum to obtain a final  5 nM  miRNA
concentration. The cells were transfected using HiPerFect
Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany)
according to manufacturer’s instructions for 18 h. MiScript
Inhibitor Negative Control (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany)
and AllStars Negative Control siRNA (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany) were used as negative controls as indicated
by manufacture’s technical specifications. Transfection
efficiency was evaluated by quantitative Real Time PCR.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
for miRNAs and pre-miRNAs
The expression of miR-21 was tested by miScript
PCR System (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Total
cellular RNA and miRNAs were isolated from K562 and
LAMA84 cells and exosomes using the RNAspin Mini
(GE Healthcare Science, Uppsala, Sweden). Reverse
transcription reactions were performed using miScript II
RT Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) as described by the
manufacturer’s instructions. We used miScript HiSpec
Buffer for cDNA synthesis to detect mature miRNA and
miScript HiFlex Buffer for cDNA synthesis to enable
quantification of precursor miRNA. Quantitative Real
Time PCR was performed using miScript SYBR Green
PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Mature miR-21
and miR-196b were detected by miScript Primer Assay
and precursor miR-21 by miScript Precursor Assays
according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNU6–2 was
used as endogenous control. Expression levels of miRNAs
and pre-miRNA were determined using the comparative
Ct method to calculate changes in Ct and ultimately fold
and percent change. An average Ct value for each RNA
was obtained from triplicate reactions.

Luciferase activity assay
The 3′-UTR of PTEN cloned in pEZX-MT01 vector
was obtained from Genecopoeia (Rockville, MD, USA).
The constructs were designed based on the sequence
of miR-21 binding sites. 12 × 104 K562 and LAMA84
cells per well in a 24-well plate were seeded in 500 μl
of RPMI, the cells were transfected with 300 ng of the
pEZX-MT01 firefly luciferase report diluted in 60 μl
culture medium without serum. K562 and LAMA84
cells were cotransfected with 6 pmol miR-21 mimic or
miR-21 inhibitor using Attractene Transfection Reagent
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s
protocol. To test whether Curcumin treatment induces a
modulation of miR-21 expression, thus inhibiting its
target PTEN, K562 and LAMA84 cells were incubated
with 20 and 40 μM of Curcumin after the transfection
of pEZXMT01 vectors. Firefly and Renilla Luciferase
activities were measured consecutively using the kit Dual
Glo® Luciferase Assay System (Promega Corp, Madison,
WI, USA) 24 hours after transfection using GloMax®Multi Detection System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI,
USA). Transfections were repeated for each samples, three
times in duplicate. Normalized data were calculated as the
ratio of Renilla/Firefly Luciferase activities.

qPCR for PTEN, VEGF and BCR-ABL
Total cellular RNA was isolated from K562 and
LAMA84 cells and exosomes using the RNAspin Mini
(GE Healthcare Science, Uppsala, Sweden). For PTEN,
VEGF and BCR-ABL mRNA detection, 1 μg of total RNA
were reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA
Archive kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, U.S.),
according to manufacturer’s instructions. PTEN, VEGF

by phase-contrast microscopy and photographed. The area
of ten colonies per condition were measured with the
IMAGE-J software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).

Conditioned medium (CM) of K562 and LAMA84
cells, treated with (10, 20, 40 μM) Curcumin, transfected
or not with miR-21 mimic or inhibitor, was collected
from cells after 24 hours of incubation. CM of K562
and LAMA84 cells, treated with 1 μM GW4869 or
cotreated with Curcumin and 1 μM GW4869, were
also collected from cells after 24 h of incubation. CM
aliquots were centrifuged to remove cellular debris and
VEGF protein levels were measured using an ELISA kit
(Invitrogen Carlsbad, California, USA), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
K562 and LAMA84 cells, treated with (20, 40 μM)
Curcumin, transfected or not with miR-21 mimic or
inhibitor, were collected and lysated. K562 and LAMA84
cells, treated with 1 μM GW4869 and/or cotreated with
Curcumin and 1 μM GW4869, were also collected and
lysated after 24 hours of incubation. pAKT levels were
quantified using an ELISA kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
California, USA), according to the manufacture’s protocol.
AKT1 (pS473) ultrasensitive ELISA allows to detect and
quantify the level of AKT1 protein that is phosphorylated
at serine residue 473. To normalize the sample for the
total AKT1 amount, we used an AKT1 (total) ELISA kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA).

Ethics statement
All animal experiments were conducted in full
compliance with University of Palermo and Italian
Legislation for Animal Care.

CML mouse xenograft
Male SCID mice four-to-five week old were
purchased from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories
International, Inc., MA, USA) and acclimated for a week.
Mice received filtered water and sterilized diet ad libitum.
Animals were observed daily and clinical signs were noted.
Mice were randomly assigned to six groups of five each.
Each mouse was inoculated subcutaneously (sc) in the right
flank with viable single cells (2 × 107) suspended in 0.2 ml
of PBS. Mice were treated every day, per os, for 2 weeks,
with 2 mg of Curcumin or vehicle (corn oil) as control.
No adverse reaction was observed in mice following
administration of this dose of Curcumin or corn oil. One
week after the last day of treatment, mice were sacrificed,
tumors were removed and measured and exosomes were
purified from plasma. Blood was collected by post-mortem
cardiac puncture into blood collection tubes, centrifuged at
850 × g for 20 min at 20°C and the supernatant (plasma)
was collected. Plasma was centrifuged at 3000 g for 15′ at
4°C, at 10000 g for 30′. Tumor volume was determined by
caliper using the formula: L × W2/2 = mm3 where L and
W are the longest and shortest perpendicular measurements
in millimeters, respectively. The tumor weights were
calculated assuming that 1mm3 = 1mg.

Western blot
Total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE
electrophoresis and immunoblotting as previously
described (26). Antibodies used in the experiments
were: Alix, TSG 101, PTEN, AKT, pAKT, Bcr-Abl and
actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). K562
or LAMA84 cells (5 × 106) were incubated with 20
and 40 μM Curcumin or DMSO for 24 hours (negative
control). Samples were resolved in 6–8% SDSPAGE
followed by immunoblotting.

following extraction of RNA from 500 μl of plasma
collected from mice treated with Curcumin and control
mice, treated with vehicle (corn oil).

K562 and LAMA84 cells treated or not with 20,
40  μM Curcumin were suspended in serum-free RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA in transwells
with 8 μm pore filters and exposed to complete RPMI
1640 as chemoattractant, for 24 hours. Some samples were
cotreated with 20, 40 μM Curcumin and 1 μM GW4869.
After incubation, cells migrated in the bottom wells were
counted.

The results indicated that 40 μM Curcumin inhibited cell
proliferation (about 25%), as compared to cells treated
with DMSO (0.001%), as control (Figure 1a and b).
Nanovesicles released from K562 and LAMA84 cells
treated with Curcumin were isolated, purified on a sucrose
gradient and characterized as exosomes, as we previously
demonstrated [7]. Vesicles were analysed by Western
blotting (Figure  1c  and 1d) using antibodies specific
for Alix and TSG-101, well known exosomal markers.

to DMSO treated cells (Figure 2a and b). On the contrary,
miR-21 was enriched in exosomes released by K562
and LAMA84 cells, after treatment with 20 and 40 μM
of Curcumin (Figure 2a and b). In order to investigate if
Curcumin modulated the miR-21 expression or induced
a selective packaging of miR-21 in exosomes, K562 and
LAMA84 cells were cotreated with 20–40 μM Curcumin
and 1 μM of GW4869, a specific neutral sphingomyelinase
(nSMase) 2 inhibitor, also known as an inhibitor of
exosomes release [25, 28]. As shown in Figure 2, GW4869
induced an increase of miR-21 in K562 (Figure 2c) and
LAMA84 (Figure 2d) cells compared with K562 and
LAMA84 cells treated with Curcumin, the cotreatment
with GW4869 and Curcumin partially reversed this effect.
In order to exclude the possibility that Curcumin treatment
of K562 and LAMA84 cells could directly affect miR-21
expression, we measured, by Real Time PCR, the levels

of Curcumin in NSCLC cells [29]. We confirmed that
miR-21 binds to PTEN 3′UTR mRNA using a Firefly/
Renilla Duo-Luciferase reporter vector (pEZX-MT01)
where the 3′ UTR of PTEN was cloned downstream of the
firefly luciferase gene (PTEN-pEZX). When K562 cells
transfected with reporter plasmid were incubated with
20 and 40 μM Curcumin, the firefly luciferase activity was

containing PTEN-pEZX, increased the activity of firefly
luciferase respect to untransfected K562 cells, similarly
to Curcumin treatment. In contrast, luciferase activity
decreased when K562 cells containing PTEN-pEZX were
transfected with miR-21 mimic.
In order to confirm the effect of Curcumin on
decrease of miR-21 through its sorting in exosomes, we
cotreated K562 cells with 1 μM GW4869 and 20 and
40  μM Curcumin. As showed in Figure 3a, GW4869
reduced the luciferase activity in PTEN-pEZX transfected
K562 cells compared with control cells. The cotreatment
with 1 μM GW4869 and 20 and 40 μM Curcumin
caused an increase of luciferase activity in PTEN-pEZX
transfected K562 (Figure 3a) with respect to PTEN-pEZX
transfected K562 cells treated with GW4869 alone. Similar
results were obtained in LAMA84 cells (Figure 3b). These
data indicate that Curcumin caused a decrease of miR-21,
in K562 and LAMA84 cells, and consequently an increase
of PTEN, its direct target.

confirm the effect of Curcumin on the sorting of miR-21
in exosomes, we cotreated CML cells with 1 μM GW4869
and 20 μM Curcumin. As showed in Figure 4c, GW4869
abrogated the upregulation of PTEN by Curcumin both
in K562 and LAMA84 cells. Data were confirmed, at
protein level, by western blotting analysis (Figure 4e).
Densitometric analyses of corresponding western blots
are showed in Figure S1b. To further demonstrate the
role of miR-21 in the modulation of PTEN levels we
knocked down miR-21 in CML cells using the miR-21
inhibitor (2′-OMe-miR-21). Real time PCR analysis
showed the transfection efficiency of miR-21inhibitor,
in K562 and LAMA84 cells (Figure S1c). Inhibition of
miR-21 in K562 and LAMA84 cells increased PTEN
mRNA expression (Figure 4d). On the contrary, the
addition of miR-21 mimic caused, as expected, a decrease
of PTEN expression (Figure 4d). Real time PCR analysis
showed the transfection efficiency of miR-21 mimic,
in K562 and LAMA84 cells (Figure S1c). In order to
evaluate, in K562 and LAMA84 cells, if downregulation
of PTEN expression in miR-21 mimic transfected
cells was reverted after the addition of Curcumin, we
treated the miR-21 mimic transfected CML cells with
20 μM Curcumin. As shown in Figure 4d (black bars
with white dots), Curcumin counteracted the effect of
the transfection with miR-21 mimic, decreasing the
expression of PTEN mRNA. On the contrary in K562
and LAMA84 cells transfected with miR-21 inhibitor and
treated with Curcumin, we observed a higher increase of
PTEN mRNA expression than CML cells transfected with
miR-21 inhibitor alone (Figure 4d, white bars).
Our data indicate that the Curcumin treatment
induces an exosomes-mediated decrease of miR-21 that in
turn causes the modulation of PTEN expression in CML
cells, confirmed by the study of gain and loss of function
for miR-21.

Curcumin induces PTEN expression
in CML cells
Previous results showed that also in our model,
miR-21 targets the 3′ UTR of PTEN mRNA. Real time
PCR analysis demonstrated that the addition of Curcumin,
to CML cells, for 24 hours, caused a dose-dependent
increase in PTEN mRNA (Figure 4a). PTEN mRNA levels
increased of 2, 5 and 4 fold in K562 and LAMA84 cells
following the addition of 20 and 40 μM of Curcumin,
respectively (Figure 4a). Data were confirmed, at protein
level, by western blotting analysis; addition of Curcumin
to CML cells, for 24 h, caused a dose-dependent increase
in PTEN protein in K562 and LAMA84 cells lysate
(Figure 4b). Densitometric analyses of corresponding
western blots are showed in Figure S1a. In order to

caused an increase of AKT phosphorylation. Moreover
the cotreatement of CML cells with GW4869 1 μM and
Curcumin 20–40 μM, reverted the effects of Curcumin
(Figure 5a and 5b). The role of miR-21 was further
demonstrated by performing an ELISA assay of CML
cells lysates, after transfection with an inhibitor or mimic
of miR-21 (Figure 5c and 5d). MiR-21 expression was
knocked down in CML cells using the miR-21 inhibitor
(2′-OMe-miR-21), as demonstrated with real time PCR
assay (Figure 1Sb). Inhibition of miR-21 in CML cells
decreased the AKT phosphorylation similar to Curcumin
treatment. On the contrary, the ELISA assay indicated
that the overexpression of miR-21 in CML cells increased

It is documented that PTEN modulates the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling
pathway, downregulating AKT phosphorylation.
To elucidate the effect of Curcumin treatment on
AKT pathway in CML cells, we showed, by ELISA assay
(Figure 5a and b) and western blot analyses (Figure S2a
and S2b), that the addition of Curcumin, for 24 h, caused a
dose-dependent decrease of AKT phosphorylation in CML

of miR-21 was determined by a selective enrichment of

cells, if the effects of the transfection with miR-21 mimic
reverted after the addition of Curcumin, we treated
the miR-21 mimic transfected CML cells with 20 μM
Curcumin. As shown in Figure 6b (white bars), Curcumin
counteracted the effect of the transfection with miR-21
mimic, causing a decreased expression of VEGF mRNA.

observed a higher decrease of VEGF mRNA expression
than CML cells transfected with miR-21 inhibitor alone

A number of studies indicate that PTEN modulates
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling
pathway and downregulates the expression of vascular

analysis demonstrated that the addition of Curcumin,
to CML cells, for 24 hours, caused a dose-dependent
decrease in VEGF mRNA (Figure 6). A 50% decrease
of VEGF mRNA levels was observed in both K562 and
LAMA84 cells after treatment with 40 μM of Curcumin

In order to support our hypothesis that the decrease

with miR-21 mimic and inhibitor. As shown in Figure 7b,
K562 and LAMA84 cells transfected with miR-21 mimic
are able to form colonies greater compared to control cells.
The transfection with miR-21 inhibitor caused a reduction
of the colonies size respect to control cells, similarly to
Curcumin treatment.

Curcumin reduces CML cells migration
Cell migration is a critical step for many biologic
processes including leukemic blasts mobilization from
bone marrow. We analyzed the effect of Curcumin
addition (20–40 μM) on K562 and LAMA84 cells motility.
Figure 7c shows that Curcumin treatment inhibited in
a dose-dependent manner, the motility of K562 and
LAMA84 cells towards complete medium. The treatment
with GW4869 increases the motility of CML cells.
The cotreatment with 20–40 μM of Curcumin and 1 μM
GW4869 reverted the effect of Curcumin (Figure 7c).
These results indicate that Curcumin affected K562 and
LAMA84 cells migration.

as compared to DMSO treated cells. On the contrary,
miR-196b was reduced in exosomes released by K562
and LAMA84 cells, after treatment with 20 and 40 μM
of Curcumin (Figure 8c and d). These data indicated that
Curcumin increased miR-196b cellular levels leading to a
reduction of Bcr-Abl protein amount in CML cells.

BCR–ABL is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase
that triggers several downstream signaling pathways
inducing the enhanced survival and proliferation of
CML cells.
Real time PCR analysis demonstrated that
Bcr-Abl mRNA levels decreased of about 20% and 45%
in K562 cells following the addition of 20 and 40 μM of
Curcumin, respectively (Figure 8a). Similar results were
obtained in LAMA84 cells treated for 24 h with 40 μM
of Curcumin. Data were confirmed, at protein level, by
western blotting analysis. The addition of Curcumin to
CML cells, for 24 h, caused a dose-dependent decrease of
Bcr-Abl protein in K562 and LAMA84 cells (Figure 8b).
In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism that causes

different compounds to use as adjuvants for conventional
therapy. In this work we investigated the antineoplastic
effect of Curcumin in CML cells.
Curcuminoids are known to inhibit the tumor
growth affecting the activity of multiple molecular
targets involved in carcinogenesis. Curcumin exhibits its
anticancer effects by regulating genes involved in cellular
signaling pathways, including nuclear factor-kappa B,
protein kinase B (AKT), mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK), p53, and other pathways [31].
In this study, we provide evidence that the
effects of Curcumin may affect in vitro and in vivo
malignant properties of CML cells and we suggest that
these effects are mediated by a disposal of miR-21 in
exosomes released by CML cells. In our previous paper,
we demonstrated that LAMA84 cells release exosomes
containing several miRNAs, differentially expressed
compared to producing parental cells. We focused our
attention on miR-126; LAMA84-exosomes were enriched
in this angiomiR that was biologically active in endothelial
cells. Other groups have also evidenced that miRNAs

DISCUSSION
The understanding of the molecular basis of chronic
myeloid leukemia development led to the synthesis
of Imatinib Mesylate (IM), a highly specific Brc-Abl,
tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Although a vast majority of
patients with CML respond to IM, resistance might occur
de novo or during treatment [30]. Resistance to IM or
to the second, third generation of TKIs has attracted the
attention of many researchers to find new therapies or

contained in the exosomes released by K562 cells, are able
to modulate cell communication and influence the genetic
changes within CML patients [32]. Recently, several
studies have indicated that miRNAs may be considered
a new class of oncogenes. These oncomirs induce tumor
growth negatively regulating tumor suppressor genes.
The modulation of oncomirs levels might represent an
alternative strategy for cancer treatment.
Ostenfeld et al showed a possible advantage for
cancer cells to eliminate tumor-suppressor miRNAs via
exosomes; this mechanism may support the metastatic
process. They demonstrated a selective pressure for
disposal of miR-23b, which may contribute to the
transcriptomic changes associated with a cellular
metastatic state [10].
In other experimental setting, De Candia et al
demonstrated that reduction of intracellular level of
miR-150, a key regulator of mRNAs critical for
lymphocyte differentiation and functions, via its selective

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

release in the external milieu, may regulate gene
expression during lymphocyte activation [33].
Now we hypothesized a novel role for exosome
release as a route to cellular disposal of an oncogenic
miRNAs, such as miR-21, as a consequence of Curcumin
treatment. The miRNA-21 has been indicated as a
miRNA overexpressed in several solid tumors; miR-21 is
involved in a number of steps of tumor progression, such
as proliferation, angiogenesis, antiapoptotic and response
to chemotherapy. A number of miR-21 target genes have
been identified, including PTEN, PDCD4, and BTG2,
which play important roles in the oncogenic process
[34]. It was demonstrated that decreased expression
of miR-21 in human lung cancer cells by inhibition
of NOX (NADPH oxidase) reduces metastasis [35].
Moreover the downregulation of miR-21 expression
restrains non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation
and migration through upregulation of programmed cell
death 4 protein [36].

Few studies have focused on the role of miR-21 in
CML progression. Li et al demonstrated that anti-miR-21
oligonucleotides (AMO-miR-21) sensitized K562 cells,
to arsenic trioxide by inducing apoptosis. AMO-miR-21
down-regulated mature miR-21 expression level and
partially induced up-regulation of PDCD4 level [37].
Other groups demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotide
against miR-21 inhibits migration and induces apoptosis
in leukemic K562 cells [38].
Our results indicate that Curcumin might exert
anticancer effects through elimination of miR-21, via
exosomes. We showed that Curcumin caused a decrease
of miR-21, but not pre-miR-21, in CML cells after
Curcumin treatment. On the contrary, we observed an
increase of miR-21 in the exosomes released by CML
cells after addition of Curcumin (Figure 2). Our results
are in line with other studies that demonstrated the effects
of Curcumin on cancer cell survival through downregulation of miR-21 and increase of PTEN. PTEN up
regulation, caused by non-genomic mechanisms, such
as post transcriptional regulation by non-coding RNA,
antagonizes the PI3K-AKT pathway [39]. This inhibitory
effect acts on the PI-3K-AKT pathway, which controls cell
proliferation and survival.
We found that the decrease of cellular miR-21,
significantly up-regulated the expression of PTEN
(Figure 4) modulating the phosphorylation of AKT
(Figure 5). Several studies also showed that Curcumin
inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and
their downstream substrates. It was demonstrated that
Difluorinated Curcumin (CDF) [40], a nontoxic analog
of Curcumin modulated the expression of miR-21 and
PTEN in pancreatic cancer and inhibited the growth
of colon cancer cells [40]. From a functional point of
view, an increase of PTEN and the consequent decrease
of AKT phosphorylation caused an inhibition of cell
survival, as we demonstrated by an in vitro colony
formation assay (Figure 7). Our current data show an
inverse relationship between miR-21 and PTEN and

support the role of Curcumin on modulation of the PTEN
expression, via a selective packaging of miR-21 in CML
exosomes (Figure 10). PTEN also modulates VEGF
expression, down-regulating PI3K/AKT pathway; forced
expression of PI3K or AKT alone directly increased
VEGF mRNA expression, suggesting that PI3K and AKT
are sufficient to regulate VEGF expression (Figure 10).
Angiogenesis in haematological malignancies is similar
to that seen in solid tumors; secreted VEGF contributes
to haematological disease progression by an autocrine or
paracrine mechanism. VEGF signaling inhibition results in
significant tumor growth delay in a wide range of animal
models [41]. As shown by our results, Curcumin treatment
caused a decrease of VEGF at mRNA and protein levels,
in K562 and LAMA84 cells (Figure 6). Masuelli et al
demonstrated in vivo the antitumor effects of Curcumin
alone or in combination with resveratrol. The authors
observed that the administration of Curcumin in Balb/c
mice reduced the growth of the transplanted salivary
gland cancer cells and this effect is potentiated by the
combination of Curcumin and resveratrol [42].
Interestingly, we observed an opposite effects of
Curcumin on the cellular level of miR-196b, a microRNA
that was recently associated to CML development.
We observed that Curcumin caused an increase
of miR-196b in CML cells and a decrease of its levels
in the released exosomes, leading to a down regulation
of Bcr-Abl levels in leukaemia cells. These results are in
line with data showing that miR-196b targets BCR-ABL
causing a decrease of oncogene expression at mRNA and
protein level. Recent studies have indicated that miR196b inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in
B-cell ALL cells. The expression levels of miR-196b were
significantly lower in patients with CML than in healthy
controls [23].
Our in vivo experiments demonstrated that
Curcumin treated animals had a significant reduction in
tumor growth as measured by the decrease in size of the
subcutaneous xenografts compared to untreated animals.

Figure 10: Working hypothesis of the effects of Curcumin on CML cells. Curcumin caused a decrease of cellular levels of

miR-21 and a concomitant increase of its amount in exosomes. Reduced levels of miR-21 in CML cells induce PTEN expression and
consequently a decrease of AKT phosphorylation and a down regulation of VEGF expression and release. Curcumin also induced the
expression of miR-196b and consequently caused a reduction of Brc-Abl expression.

Moreover, the amount of exosomes collected from plasma
of treated mice was higher than control mice and these
exosomes are enriched in miR-21 compared to control
exosomes. Overall, these data indicated an antineoplastic
role of Curcumin in CML cells, by a selective packaging
of miR-21 in exosomes and an increase of miR-196b in
CML cells suggesting that Curcumin could be a potential
therapeutic agent for CML.
