BACKGROUND. In western countries, the Kirsten ras oncogene homolog gene
(KRAS) mutation rate is high in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
especially in those with adenocarcinoma (30%-50%), but the epidermal growth
factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutation rate is very low (3%-8%). In addition, KRAS
mutations reportedly were associated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFRTKI) resistance. In Taiwan, high EGFR mutation rates associated with high EGFRTKI response rates in patients with NSCLC have been reported; however, KRAS
mutation data are limited and have not been correlated with TKI response.

METHODS. KRAS mutation analysis was performed on 237 NSCLC specimens, and
the results were correlated with clinicopathologic features. All but 2 tumors also
underwent EGFR mutation analysis.

159 patients) and 1.56% in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (1 of 64
patients). Four mutations were G12V, 3 mutations were G12D, 1 mutation was L19F,
and 1 was the duplication insertion mutation dupT50_M72. In contrast, EGFR
mutations were detected in 96 of 235 patients (40.8%) and in 90 of 157 adenocarcinomas (57.3%). None of the KRAS mutations coexisted with EGFR mutations. KRAS
mutations were not associated significantly with any clinicopathologic characteristics, including smoking status. Among the 53 patients who had received TKI monotreatment, only 1 patient had a KRAS mutation and had progressive disease.

CONCLUSIONS. The KRAS mutation rate was too low to play a significant role in
TKI resistance or tumorigenesis among Taiwanese patients with NSCLC, which
was the complete reverse of the results reported in western countries. Cancer

L

ung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer death worldwide in recent years. With the recent progresses in molecular
biology, the tumorigenesis of lung cancer is understood better, and
clinical management is benefited. One of the most extensively
investigated oncogenes is the Kirsten ras oncogene homolog gene
KRAS, which was reported first as an oncogene in human cancer in
1982.1 Today, KRAS has become 1 of the most frequently activated
oncogenes, because it has been established that from 17% to 25% of
all human tumors harbor an activating mutation.2
K-Ras protein belongs to the Ras family, which includes H-Ras,
N-Ras, and K-Ras. Ras proteins are a group of low-molecular-weight,

membrane-localized GTPases linking extracellular
signals to intracellular signaling pathways. Various
membrane receptor tyrosine kinases, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), can activate
the Ras proteins, The activated Ras proteins target a
large number of downstream cell effector proteins,
which involve cell growth, differentiation, survival,
and angiogenesis.3 KRAS is the most frequently
mutated gene in the Ras family. The most common
mutation sites are in codon 12 (80% of tumors),
codon 13, and codon 61.4,5 Activating KRAS mutations are most prevalent in pancreatic carcinomas
(72%-90%), colorectal carcinomas (28%-57%), and
lung carcinomas (15%-50%).4-8 In lung cancers, KRAS
mutations are detected in 15% to 20% of nonsmall
cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), are most frequent in
adenocarcinomas (30%-50%), are rare in small cell
lung cancers, and are more frequent in smokers.9-12
In recent years, it has been demonstrated that
targeted therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib or erlotinib, produces
a rapid and good therapeutic response in advanced
adenocarcinomas of lung, and this has become an
important therapeutic agent for the treatment of
NSCLC, especially in East Asia.13,14 The mechanism
of gefitinib responsiveness has been associated with
mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain.15,16
In addition, a big difference in the EGFR mutation
rate in patients with NSCLC between western countries (3%-8%) and East Asian countries (39%-40%)
also was reported and was highly correlated with
the EGFR-TKI response rate in these areas.15-18
Conversely, KRAS mutations reportedly were associated with resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy.19,20
Eberhard et al also reported that patients with
NSCLC patients who had KRAS mutations had a
decreased objective response rate when they
received erlotinib plus first-line chemotherapy.21
However, Reck et al observed that the response rate
to erlotinib did not correlated significantly with
KRAS mutation status in their patients with
NSCLC.22 In addition, EGFR and KRAS mutations
almost never coexisted in lung cancers in all of the
reported series. Only 1 study reported 2 lung
tumors that had coexisting mutations.21
We previously reported a very high EGFR mutation rate (55%) and a good therapeutic response
rate to EGFR-TKI therapy among Taiwanese patients
with lung adenocarcinoma.17,23 For the current
report, our objective was to study the KRAS mutation status in our patients with NSCLC and its association with TKI sensitivity, because most of the
reported series in the English literatures were from
western countries.19-22

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients Who Underwent Surgical Excision But Received
No EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Treatment
One hundred eleven patients who underwent surgical excision or biopsy from 2002 to 2005 and 73
patients who underwent surgical excision from 1996
to 1998 for NSCLC at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital
were included in this study. All patients had freshfrozen tumor tissue samples available in the tissue
bank of Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, and all
patients provided informed consent. Among them,
EGFR mutation data from 101 patients were reported
previously.17
Patients Who Received EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitor Treatment
Fifty-three patients with advanced NSCLC who
received either gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy
from 2003 to 2006 were included in this study. The
inclusion criteria were: informed consent obtained
from patients and families, stage IIIB or IV disease
with pathologically proven NSCLC, and adequate
clinical follow-up data for the evaluation of treatment response. All patients had tumor DNA available
for mutation analyses from fresh, computed tomography-guided biopsy specimens (24 patients) or from
paraffin-embedded tissues (30 patients). Among
them, EGFR and KRAS mutation data from 30
patients were reported previously.23
In total, 237 patients were included in the current investigation. The objectives of this study were
to determine the KRAS mutation status for each
patient and to compare it with the EGFR mutation
status, EGFR-TKI sensitivity, and other clinicopathologic characteristics in patients with NSCLC. The
study protocol was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Chang-Gung Memorial
Hospital and National Health Research Institutes.
Methods
Extraction of tissue DNA
DNA extraction from fresh-frozen tumor tissue samples or from paraffin-embedded tumor tissues was
performed according to the protocol described
previously.17,23
Mutation analyses of KRAS exons 1 and 2
Only coding sequences of exons 1 and 2 of K-ras
were amplified and subjected to direct sequencing.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers used
were: E1 forward (E1F), 50 -GGT ACT GGT GGA GTA
TTT GAT AG-30 ; E1 reverse (E1R), 50 -CAA AGA ATG
GTC CTG CAC CAG-30 ; E2F, 50 -GGA GCA GGA ACA

ATG TCT TTT C-30 ; and E2R, 50 -GCA TGG CAT TAG
CAA AGA CTC-30 . PCR amplification was performed
in a total volume of 25 lL containing 50 ng of template DNA. After denaturing at 948C for 5 minutes,
35 thermal cycles (for fresh-frozen tissue DNA) or 40
cycles (for paraffin-embedded tissue DNA) were carried out. The denaturing step was set at 948C for 30
seconds, annealing was set at 538C (exon 1) or at
508C (exon 2) for 45 seconds, extension was set at
728C for 1 minute, and the sequence ended with a
final extension step at 728C for 7 minutes. Forward
and reverse sequencing reactions were performed
using the same primers for PCR on an ABI3730
genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
Calif). The sequences were determined by the Seqscape software (Applied Biosystems). The KRAS reference sequence is based on NM_004985 from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information database. All mutations were re-examined by a second
independent PCR reaction and repeated sequencing.
To increase the sensitivity and confirm the mutation, the TaqMan assay for analyzing KRAS codon 12
mutations also was performed, but it was done only
in the tumors without EGFR mutations. The LightMix
Kit K-ras Codon 12 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Berlin, Germany) was used and performed according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, The PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 10 lL containing 2.5 lL of DNA template, 2 lL of LightCycler
FastStart DNA Master Hybridization Mixture (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH), 0.8 lL of 25 mM MgCl2, and 2
lL of reagent mix (parameter-specific reagents containing primers, probes, and competitor). The mixtures were processed for PCR amplification with the
LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). The melting
curve was conducted by using LightCycler analysis
software (version 3.5) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Mutation analyses of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain
For EGFR mutation analyses, the coding sequences
from exons 18 to 21 were amplified and subjected to
direct sequencing as described previously.17,23

had stable disease (a change in tumor size between
>25% and <50% that lasted for 4 weeks) that was
sustained for >3 months also were classified as

cell carcinomas, and 14 other types of NSCLC. KRAS
mutations were identified only in 9 of 237 patients
(3.8%). Except for 1 mutation that was identified in a
squamous cell carcinoma, all mutations were identified in adenocarcinomas. The mutation rate was
5.03% (8 of 159 patients) for adenocarcinoma, 1.56%
(1 of 64 patients) for squamous cell carcinoma, and
0% for the14 other types of NSCLC. Among the 9
patients who had KRAS mutations, 5 were women,
and all 5 were never-smokers. The remaining 4
patients were men, and all 4 were previous smokers.
Because the mutation rate was low, none of the clinicopathologic characteristics, including smoking
history and pathology types, had a statistically significant association with KRAS mutation, although most
of the mutations were identified in adenocarcinomas.
The only significant association was the absence of
EGFR mutation, because these 2 mutations never
coexist in the same tumor.
The mutation patterns are shown in Table 2.
Seven mutations occurred in codon 12 (4 were G12V,
and 3 were G12D), 1 occurred in codon 19 (L19F),
and 1 occurred in exon 2 (dupT50_M72). The latter 2
mutations are novel mutations (Fig. 1 and 2). None
of the 9 patients had coexisting EGFR mutations.

EGFR Mutation Analysis and Clinical Characteristics
All but 2 of 237 patients also underwent successful
EGFR mutation analysis of the tyrosine kinase domain. The clinicopathologic characteristics associated with EGFR mutations are shown in Table 3.
There were 157 adenocarcinomas, 64 squamous cell
carcinomas, and 14 other types of NSCLC. EGFR
mutations were identified in 96 of 235 patients
(40.8%) and in 90 of 157 adenocarcinomas (57.3%), 2
of 64 squamous cell carcinomas (3.1%), and 4 of 14
other types of NSCLC (28.5%). The clinicopathologic

characteristics that were associated significantly with
EGFR mutation were sex, smoking history, pathologic
type, and clinical stage. The association with sex was
related mainly to a higher percentage of adenocarcinomas among women. Thus, when we analyzed the
difference is sex only among patients with adenocarcinoma, the association with sex became nonsignificant (P 5 .434). Conversely, the association with
smoking history remained significant when we analyzed only the patients with adenocarcinoma (P 5
.0123). The significant association with stage was
secondary to the high percentage of patients with adenocarcinoma in the stage IV group (45 adenocarcinomas and only 3 squamous cell carcinomas), which
resulted in a much higher mutation rate (64%) in for
patients with stage IV disease compared with other
stage groups.

KRAS Mutations and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Sensitivity
Among the 53 patients who received EGFR-TKI treatment, only 2 patients had squamous cell carcinoma,
and 51 patients had adenocarcinoma. There were 24
responders (1 complete response and 23 partial
responses) and 29 nonresponders (7 patients
obtained a clinical benefit, and 22 patients had progressive disease). All 53 patients underwent successful KRAS mutation analysis, and all but 2 patients
also underwent EGFR mutation analysis data. Only 1
of 53 patients had a KRAS mutation (G12V). This
patient was a woman with adenocarcinoma and had
progressive disease while she was receiving gefitinib
therapy. The number of patients who had KRAS
mutations was too small to reach any conclusion
regarding TKI sensitivity. In contrast, EGFR mutations
were identified in 33 of 51 patients. Among 24
responders, data were obtained from 23 patients,
and all were positive for EGFR mutations. Three of 7

patients who obtained a clinical benefit from therapy
had EGFR mutations (2 L858R mutations and 1
L861Q mutation). Among the 22 patients who had
progressive disease, data were obtained from 21
patients, and 7 of those patients were positive for
EGFR mutations The EGFR mutations in the 7
patients included L858R in 5 patients, I744M in 1
patient, and a duplication insertion in exon 20 in 1
patient. In total, there were 6 patients with exon 19
deletions and 16 patients with L858R mutations. The
response rate for exon 19 deletion was 100% (6 of 6
patients, including 1 patient who achieved a complete response). For the L858R mutation, the
response rate was 56% (9 of 16 patients). If the
patients who obtained a clinical benefit were
included in the response analysis, then the response
rate for patients with the L858R mutation would be
raised to 69% (11 of 16 patients). There was only 1
patient with a G719C mutation and 1 patient with a
L861Q mutation. The former patient achieved a partial response, and the latter patient obtained a clinical benefit. The results were similar to our previous
report: Not all EGFR mutations were associated with
TKI response.23

DISCUSSION
KRAS mutations in lung cancer have been studied for
more than 20 years. These mutations occur mainly in
adenocarcinoma and are associated strongly with
smoking-related carcinogenesis.10-12 The studies from
East Asian regions were limited, except for Japan. In
the largest report series from Japan by Noda et al, the
KRAS mutation rate was only 8% (33 of 410 patients)
in NSCLC.25 This mutation rate is much lower than
what is reported in western countries. In the current
report, we have summarized the data from KRAS
mutations studies in NSCLC from the East Asian
regions, including our results, and compared them
with the data from western countries (Table 4). Before
the Year 2005, there were only 3 reports from Korea,
Hong Kong, and Taiwan, respectively.26-28 In recent
years, with the increasing importance of TKI therapy
for NSCLC, several studies have been published that
analyze both EGFR and KRAS mutation status in Asian
populations with NSCLC.18,28-31 However, all of those
studies were focused mainly on EGFR mutations and
TKI sensitivity. The descriptions of KRAS mutations
generally were very short, and only data on the mutation rate were shown. Most studies from East Asian
reported a much lower KRAS mutation rate than the
rate reported in western countries. However, 2 studies
reported a KRAS mutation rate >10%, including
1 study from Korea (31.2% KRAS mutation rate in

adenocarcinomas from different geographic areas.
They also observed that KRAS mutations were
detected more frequently in patients from the United

Taiwan (12% vs 5%; P 5 .001).32 However, no specific
data were available to compare the differences
between patients from Japan or Taiwan. In addition,
their KRAS mutation rate for patients from the United
States and Australia (12%) was lower than that in previous reports from western countries.9-12,19,20,33-35

higher than previous reports,15,16,20,21 probably
because their patients from the United States and
Australia included different ethnicities (Asian and
non-Asian). To our knowledge, the current report is
the largest series to date of a KRAS mutation analysis
in patients with NSCLC along with the evaluation of
TKI sensitivity in a single Asian ethnicity. Furthermore, the KRAS mutation rate (3.80% in 237 NSCLCs
and 5.03% in adenocarcinomas) reported herein is the
lowest among all reported series to date (Table 4).
In this study, we observed no significant correlation between smoking and KRAS mutations, which
was quite different from the reports from western
countries.9-12 In our series, more never-smokers (5
women) than ever-smokers (4 men) were associated
with KRAS mutations. Contradictory results about
the association between smoking and KRAS mutations were reported in several studies from Asian
populations, some even from the same region (Table 4).25-31 One possible reason for the greater number of never-smokers with KRAS mutations in our
series may be the large numbers and high proportions of never-smoking patients (145 never-smokers
vs 73 ever-smokers), which would increase the numbers of never-smokers. In contrast, in most of the
KRAS mutation studies from the literature, the proportions of ever-smokers were >70%, and the numbers of never-smokers usually were quite small.9-12
Another reason for observing no association with
smoking may be because of the very low KRAS
mutation rate. In a KRAS mutation study from Taiwan by Wang et al (5 of 84 patients), all 5 patients
with KRAS mutations were men who were smokers,
but the association between sex and smoking still
was nonsignificant.28
It is interesting to note the low KRAS mutation
rate for NSCLC in Asian populations compared with
western countries. It is possible to speculate that this
may be a general phenomenon in the region regardless of tumor type. However, this is not true according to our survey of the literature. The KRAS
mutation rates reportedly were from 26.5% to 30% in
colorectal cancer and 90% in pancreatic cancer in
Taiwan and Hong Kong.36-38 These results are similar
to those reported from western countries. Thus, the
low KRAS mutation rate in Asian populations appears
to be unique in lung cancer. Although KRAS mutations almost never coexist with EGFR mutations, this
low KRAS mutation rate cannot be explained simply
by the high EGFR mutation rate in our population.
In the current study, the KRAS mutation rate among
the patients with NSCLC who had wild-type EGFR
still was very low (9 of 141 patients; 6.38%), compared with that in western countries.

Among the 53 patients who received TKI therapy,
there were 24 patients who had a complete or partial
response, 7 patients who obtained a clinical benefit,
and 22 patients who had progressive disease. Only 1
patient had a KRAS mutation and had progressive
disease. Thus, only 1 of 29 nonresponders had a
KRAS mutation (3.4%). The number of patients with
KRAS mutations in this series probably was too small
to draw any conclusions regarding TKI sensitivity.
However, the results suggest that KRAS mutation
should play no significant role in TKI resistance in
our population. Recently, a few new genetic changes
associated with TKI resistance also were reported in
patients with NSCLC both from western countries
and from East Asian regions; those changes included
a second-site point EGFR mutation of T790M and
c-Met amplifications.39-44 However, those changes
were observed mainly in patients with secondary TKI
resistance. It will be very interesting to determine the
role of c-Met amplification in NSCLC among our
patients, and such studies currently are ongoing.
In recent years, with the development of new
chemotherapy regimens, the survival of patients with
advanced-stage NSCLC has improved. However,
phase 2 trials with new chemotherapy regimens
repeatedly have indicated a discrepancy between
patients from Asian countries and patients from western countries. The median survival of patients with
NSCLC from Japan and Taiwan (12-15 months) was
much longer than that reported in patients with
NSCLC from western countries (8-9 months) in noncomparative studies.45-48 In a phase 3 clinical trial
comparing ‘common paclitaxel and carboplatin
arms’ simultaneously in Japan and the United States,
patients with advanced-stage NSCLC were selected
that had with identical eligibility, staging, response,
and toxicity criteria. The results indicated that the 1year survival rate was significantly better in the Japanese arm (P 5 .0004).49 The mechanism for this difference remains unclear. It is suspected that the high
EGFR mutation rate in Asian patients plays a role;
however, in a study by Cappuzzo et al, EGFR mutations were not associated with the response to firstline chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC.50 EGFR
mutations also were not associated with better overall survival.18,32 Conversely, KRAS mutations were
associated with shorter survival irrespective of therapeutic regimen according to many studies from
Asian and western countries.26,28,51-54 However, all of
those reports on KRAS mutations were published
before the Year 2000. Recently, more favorable clinical outcomes were reported for patients with NSCLC
who had EGFR mutations, compared with patients
who had KRAS mutations, in studies from the United

Reversed Mutation Rate of KRAS and EGFR/Wu et al

States.21,35 One of those studies was for patients who
received chemotherapy with or without erlotinib, and
the other study was for patients who underwent surgical resection. It is plausible that the low KRAS
mutation rate among Asian patients may have contributed to the difference in survival with the newly
developed chemotherapy regimens. The underlying
cause may not be the KRAS mutation itself but also
may be related to the associated genetic background.
The mechanism of reversed mutation rates of the
KRAS and EGFR genes among patients with lung adenocarcinoma in Taiwan compared with western
patients is intriguing and is worthy of further investigation.
