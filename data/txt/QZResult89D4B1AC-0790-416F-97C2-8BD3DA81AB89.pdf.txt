Comparative Risk-Adjusted
Mortality Outcomes After
Primary Surgery, Radiotherapy,
or Androgen-Deprivation
Therapy for Localized Prostate
Cancer
I read with great interest the article by Cooperberg and co-

workers1 studying survival rates in differently treated men
with early prostate cancer. In this study, patients who underwent radical prostatectomy had a substantially decreased disease-specific mortality, particularly in the higher-risk groups,
compared with those who were selected for radiation therapy or conservative management.1 Unlike Cooperberg
et al., I do not consider it unlikely that unmeasured confounding, at least in part, accounted for the observed differences. It is conceivable that patients with a particularly
adverse profile within the same risk category might have
preferably been referred to external-beam radiotherapy, thus
putting this treatment modality at a disadvantage. It is questionable whether this phenomenon is adequately covered by
conventional prognostic factors because subjective clinical
judgment is included. Selection in favor of surgery is a problem when different treatments for early prostate cancer are
compared.2,3 Even careful risk adjustment will hardly be
able to eliminate this effect completely.3,4 Otherwise, it
would be difficult to justify randomized trials comparing
radical prostatectomy and external-beam radiotherapy in
this setting that the authors rightly called for.1

Risk-Adjusted Mortality
Outcomes After Primary

for Localized Prostate Cancer
Dr. Froehner suggests our article1 claimed unmeasured
confounding is not a partial explanation for the differences observed among treatment modalities. In fact, we explicitly considered that possibility, devoting multiple
sensitivity analyses and a significant portion of the discussion to this very question. The question is not whether
there is unmeasured confounding underlying the analysisÅwe will never know for sure but must assume this possibility. The question is whether unmeasured
confounding can explain a 2-fold difference in mortality
between radiation and surgery and a 3-fold difference
between androgen deprivation and surgery.
The presumptions in Dr. Froehner’s argument are
that radiation and androgen-deprivation patients have
inherently higher-risk disease than surgery patients and
that this difference in risk is not captured by multivariate
risk-stratification systems. The sensitivity analysis presented in Table 5 of the article1 was designed to quantify
the unmeasured confounding one would have to assume
to explain away the findings. We artificially raised the
Kattan scores for each of the surgery patients by 5-point
increments, in effect giving them progressively less
‘‘credit’’ for their baseline disease characteristics in the
risk-adjusted survival analysis.
The mortality difference between surgery and radiation remained statistically significant until the surgery
patient scores were raised by 20 points and did not attenuate
completely until the scores had been raised by 30 points.
Thus, to attribute the observed mortality difference to
unmeasured confounding, we would have to assume that a
radiation-therapy patient with a predicted survival, for
example, of 80% would have the same biologic risk as a

2577

surgical patient with a predicted survival of 60%. Moreover,
these imbalances in prediction would have to be both pervasive and consistent. Given the established accuracy of risk
prediction for both surgical and radiation-therapy patients,
such a consistent imbalance seems highly unlikely.
We reiterate that randomized trials for men with
high-risk disease are essential and that these must include
surgical arms. In the interim, our study, together with
others recently published and/or presented, points to a
larger role for surgery—often as a part of a multimodal
approach—for high-risk prostate cancer.

Detection of Minimal Residual
Disease in Blood and Bone
Marrow in Early Stage Breast
Cancer
In a recent article published in Cancer, Krishnamurthy
et al used a pancytokeratin antibody cocktail (AE1/AE3,
CAM5.2, MNF116, cytokeratin 8 [CK8], and CK18) to
immunostain bone marrow cytospin specimens that were
believed to contain disseminated tumor cells from
patients with early stage breast cancer.1 They possibly
overlooked the manufacturer’s information, and used
redundant anti-CAM5.2 and anti-CK8 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), which may misguide the readers when
building a cost-effective comparable antibody cocktail for
detecting such wide-spectrum CKs.
The anti-CK CAM5.2 MoAb, clone CAM 5.2 (BD
Biosciences, Sparks, Md), reacts primarily with CK8 (52
kilodaltons [kD]). Anti-CK AE1/AE3, clone AE1/AE3
(Dako, Carpinteria, Calif), is comprised of 2 MoAbs. The
2578

AE1 MoAb identifies an antigenic determinant present
on the majority of the A subfamily of CKs, including CKs
with Moll designations 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 19 (molecular weights [MWs] of 56.5, 540 , 50, 500 , 48, and 40 kD,
respectively). The AE3 MoAb identifies an antigenic
determinant shared by the B subfamily of CKs including
CKs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (MWs of 65, 67, 64, 59, 58,
56, 54, and 52 kD, respectively). Accordingly, the antiCK CAM5.2 MoAb does not expand the detecting spectrum of anti-CK AE1/AE3.
Despite anti-CK8, clone C51 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif), and anti-CK18, clone DC10 (Invitrogen),
the anti-CK8/CK18 MoAb, clone Zym5.2 (Invitrogen), recognizes human CKs with MWs of 52 kD and
45 kD, respectively, corresponding to CK8 and CK18.
The anti-CK MNF116 MoAb, clone MNF116
(Dako), labels the numbers of discrete bands ranging
from 40 kD to 58 kD on immunoblot analysis, corresponding to CK5, CK6, CK8, CK17, and most likely
CK19. Accordingly, the anti-CK8/CK18 and MNF116
MoAbs offer the additional ability to detect CK17 and
CK18, which are complementary to the antibody spectrum covered by the anti-CK AE1/AE3.
We clarified that the 3-antibody cocktail (panel), either AE1/AE3-MNF116-CK18 or AE1/AE3-MNF116CK8/CK18, is sufficient in detecting similar broad-spectrum CKs including CKs 1 to 8, CK10, and CKs 13 to
19. The superfluous anti-CK CAM5.2 and anti-CK8
MoAbs seem to provide no remarkable advantages to the
pancytokeratin cocktail (AE1/AE3-CAM5.2-MNF116CK8-CK18) that used in this study.

Reply to Detection of Minimal
Residual Disease in Blood and
Bone Marrow in Early Stage
Breast Cancer
We read with great interest the letter by Kuo et al
regarding our use of a cocktail of cytokeratin (CK) antibodies in our Cancer article.1 We respectfully disagree
with the authors’ assertion that we overlooked the manufacturer’s information and used redundant anti-CAM5.2
and anti-CK8 antibodies and that we may be misleading
readers who may be designing a cost-effective CK antibody cocktail.
We used a cocktail of CK antibodies including AE1/
AE3 (Dako, Carpinteria, Calif), CAM5.2 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif), MNF116 (Dako), and CK8/
CK18 (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, Calif). We
agree with the authors that MNF116 and CK8/CK18 can
identify CKs that are not recognized by AE1/AE3, including CKs such as CK17 and CK18. We did not use individual CK8 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) or CK18
(Invitrogen) antibodies as referred to by the authors but
used the CK8/CK18 antibody (Zymed Laboratories). We
agree with the authors that the antigenic epitopes recognized by the CAM5.2 antibody, which mainly recognizes
CK8 with weaker reactivity against CK7, can also be recognized by the CK8/CK18 antibody and the AE3 component of the AE1/AE3 antibody. However, it is to be noted
that the affinity of the antibodies, which were produced
differently, against a common epitope can vary, which can
result in mild if not marked variability in their sensitivities
with respect to epitope recognition. The variability in the
sensitivity of these 2 antibodies has been reported in earlier studies that compared these 2 antibodies directly.2 We
have provided some recent reports in the pathology literature in which AE1/AE3 and CAM5.2 were used for the
investigation of undifferentiated and metaplastic carcinomas.3,4 In essence, we used a very robust cocktail of CK
antibodies with a wide spectrum of specificity to increase
the sensitivity of detection of disseminated tumor cells in
the bone marrow of patients with breast cancer.

Intravenous Methotrexate as
Central Nervous System (CNS)
Prophylaxis Is Associated With a
Low Risk of CNS Recurrence in
High-Risk Patients With Diffuse
Large B-Cell Lymphoma
We read with interest the article by Abramson et al.1
describing their results incorporating high-dose intravenous
methotrexate (HD MTX) with a rituximab-cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin or Adriamycin),
vincristine (Oncovin), and prednisone combination (RCHOP) to prevent central nervous system (CNS) recurrence
in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients at risk
of this complication. We have used a similar approach for
CNS prophylaxis in at-risk DLBCL patients at our institution and found comparably low rates of CNS relapse.
Similar to Abramson et al.,1 patients were deemed at
high risk of CNS recurrence when their lymphomas met
previously published criteria2 or occurred in ‘‘at risk’’ sites.
However, unlike Abramson et al.,1 we scheduled HD
MTX after completion of R-CHOP as follows: R-CHOP
x6 with 4-6 doses of intrathecal (IT) MTX (12 mg IT day
1 R-CHOP) followed by 2 doses of HD MTX (3 gm/m2
days 1 and 15) .
Since 2003, 32 consecutive at-risk DLBCL patients
have been treated with R-CHOP and IT and HD MTX
for CNS prophylaxis at our institution. Median age of
patients was 63 years (range, 26-79 years), with a majority
(29 of 32 patients) suffering advanced stage and high-

intermediate or high-risk International prognostic index
(IPI, 24 of 32). Patients were assigned as high risk of CNS
recurrence when they had a combination of elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and involvement of 2 extranodal sites (56% and 44% of patients, respectively) due to
involvement of an at-risk site. Overall response to R-CHOP
plus IT and HD MTX was 97%, with 94% complete
response (CR). At a median follow-up of 22 months (range,
2.4-71 months), 2-year overall and relapse-free survival rates
were 91% and 92%, respectively. Systemic relapse occurred
in 2 patients, 1 of whom subsequently suffered a CNS
relapse. HD MTX was well tolerated and was delivered on
an outpatient basis to 75% of patients. The major complication was transient reversible elevation in creatinine in 34% of
patients, necessitating dose reduction of the second HD
MTX treatment in 19% of patients.
We fully agree with Abramson et al.1 that use of HD
MTX in addition to R-CHOP chemotherapy offers effective prophylaxis of CNS recurrence in at-risk DLBCL
patients and think our data supports the effectiveness and
safety of this therapy.

Reply to Intravenous
Methotrexate as Central Nervous
System (CNS) Prophylaxis Is
Associated With a Low Risk of
CNS Recurrence in High-Risk
Patients With Diffuse Large BCell Lymphoma
We are pleased to read the experience from the Royal
Brisbane and Women’s Hospital supporting the role of
2580

systemic methotrexate as prophylaxis against central nervous system (CNS) recurrence in high-risk patients with
diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. The lack of substantial
toxicity in their patients up to age 79 years further supports the tolerability of this agent in centers experienced
in its use. Dr. O’Rourke and colleagues administered intrathecal methotrexate concurrently with rituximab-cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin or
Adriamycin), vincristine (Oncovin), and prednisone combination (R-CHOP), followed by 2 infusions of systemic
methotrexate with encouraging results similar to ours
where intravenous methotrexate is interdigitated with RCHOP without intrathecal therapy.1 Incorporation of
both intrathecal and systemic prophylaxis has been validated as CNS protection compared with a regimen containing no CNS prophylaxis,2 but the relative
contribution of the intrathecal versus systemic therapy
remains unclear. Given the absence of clear benefit conferred by intrathecal prophylaxis alone,3,4 we believe the
systemic therapy is driving the reduction in CNS recurrences. Of note, CNS recurrence may occur before completion of R-CHOP therapy, so reserving prophylaxis
until the end carries a theoretical risk of initiating therapy
too late, but this did not occur in the Royal Brisbane and
Women’s experience.
We, too, administer high-dose systemic methotrexate on an outpatient basis, but we recommend this therapy
be conducted only in experienced centers given the risk of
treatment-related complications including renal failure,
myelotoxicity, and mucositis. Our outpatient approach is
to have patients hydrate and alkalinize orally at home the
day prior to methotrexate administration. On day 15,
patients are further alkalinized and hydrated intravenously
in clinic, followed by the intravenous methotrexate.
Patients return 24 hours later to check the methotrexate
level and their renal function and to receive their initial
dose of leucovorin rescue and additional intravenous
hydration. Patients clearing the drug well without renal
toxicity continue leucovorin rescue orally every 6 hours
for 12-16 total doses and return on day 22 for their next
cycle of R-CHOP. Patients with renal failure or delayed
drug clearance are admitted for intensified leucovorin,
hydration, and supportive care.
