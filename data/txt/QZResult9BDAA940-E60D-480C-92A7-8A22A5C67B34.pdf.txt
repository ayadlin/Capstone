ABSTRACT
The glucose transporter isoform 1 (GLUT1; SLC2A1) is a key rate-limiting factor in
the transport of glucose into cancer cells. Enhanced GLUT1 expression and accelerated
glycolysis have been found to promote aggressive growth in a range of tumor entities.
However, it was unknown whether GLUT1 directly impacts metastasis. Here, we
aimed at analyzing the expression and function of GLUT1 in malignant melanoma.
Immunohistochemical analysis of 78 primary human melanomas on a tissue micro
array showed that GLUT1 expression significantly correlated with the mitotic activity
and a poor survival. To determine the functional role of GLUT1 in melanoma, we
stably suppressed GLUT1 in the murine melanoma cell line B16 with shRNA. GLUT1
suppressed melanoma cells revealed significantly reduced proliferation, apoptosis
resistance, migratory activity and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) expression.
In a syngeneic murine model of hepatic metastasis, GLUT1-suppressed cells formed
significantly less metastases and showed increased apoptosis compared to metastases
formed by control cells. Treatment of four different human melanoma cell lines with a
pharmacological GLUT1 inhibitor caused a dose-dependent reduction of proliferation,
apoptosis resistance, migratory activity and MMP2 expression. Analysis of MAPK
signal pathways showed that GLUT1 inhibition significantly decreased JNK activation,
which regulates a wide range of targets in the metastatic cascade. In summary, our
study provides functional evidence that enhanced GLUT1 expression in melanoma
cells favors their metastatic behavior. These findings specify GLUT1 as an attractive
therapeutic target and prognostic marker for this highly aggressive tumor.

INTRODUCTION

at the molecular level the disease progression is poorly
understood [4].
In the 1920s, Otto Warburg made the observation
that tumor cells utilize glycolysis instead of mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation for energy production even
under oxygen-rich conditions. Lately, the “Warburg effect”
has experienced a revival, because it has been shown that
aerobic glycolysis governs tumor cell biology [5, 6].

Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin
cancer. Even very thin primary tumors may seed
metastases and precipitate rapid death [1, 2]. The
worldwide incidence of melanoma is increasing more
than in any other neoplastic disease [3]. Still, to date
there is no effective therapy for metastatic melanoma and

The glucose transporter isoform 1 (GLUT1;
SLC2A1) is a key rate-limiting factor in the transport
and metabolism of glucose in cancer cells. GLUT1
expression is primarily undetectable in normal epithelial
tissues and benign epithelial tumors. However, GLUT1
is overexpressed in a significant proportion of human
carcinomas [7-9]. The apparent expression of a certain
type of glucose transporter suggests an important role for
this transporter in tumor biology. Therefore, it has been
hypothesized that elevated GLUT1 expression by human
carcinomas indicates enhanced utilization of energy and an
increased metabolic state. This may induce proliferation
and tumor growth and herewith indirectly promote
metastatic behavior. Actually, GLUT1 protein expression
confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors
[10-14] but experimental studies which functionally proof
an impact of GLUT1 expression on metastasis are missing.
Furthermore, malignant melanoma studies regarding
GLUT1 expression have revealed inconclusive results
and the biological significance of GLUT1 in disease

progression has remained unknown [15-19].
Here, we aimed to analyze GLUT1 expression
in a large series of benign nevi, primary melanomas
and melanoma metastases and correlated GLUT1
expression levels with clinicopathological characteristics.
Furthermore, we analyzed the functional effect of GLUT1
expression on growth and metastasis of melanoma cells in
vitro and in vivo. Together, experimental and patients data
show that enhanced GLUT1 expression advances both
growth and metastasis of malignant melanoma.

RESULTS
GLUT1 expression in primary human melanoma
and melanoma metastases
First, we analyzed GLUT1 expression in a series
of 118 benign nevi, 78 primary human malignant

melanomas, and 60 melanoma metastases applying
GLUT1 immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray
(TMA) technology [20]. In 65% (77/118) of the nevi no
GLUT1 immunosignal was detectable, 35% (41/118)
showed weak GLUT1 staining and in only one nevus
strong GLUT1 staining was detectable (Figure 1A).
In contrast, in only 50% (39/78) of primary melanoma
tissues no GLUT1 immunosignal was detectable, 47%
(37/78) showed at least weak staining and 2 tissues had
a strong GLUT1 immunosignal (p = 0.038 compared
to nevi) (Figure 1A). Melanoma metastases revealed
an even stronger GLUT1 immunosignal compared to
primary melanomas (p = 0.004). In only 42% (29/69)
of metastases no GLUT1 immunosignal was detectable
but 20% (12/69) showed strong GLUT1 staining (Figure
1A). For descriptive data analysis, clinico-pathological
characteristics of primary tumors were compared with
GLUT1 immunohistochemistry (Table 1). Interestingly,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

GLUT1 expression significantly correlated with the
proliferation rate (KI67 labeling index) of primary
malignant melanomas. No correlation was found between
GLUT1 expression and age and gender of melanoma
patients or the Clark level, thickness, and the growth
pattern of the primary tumors. Importantly, patients with
GLUT1 positive tumors revealed a significantly lower
progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (Figure
1B, 1C). Together, these data indicate that GLUT1
expression correlates with metastasis and a poor prognosis
in patients with malignant melanoma.

expression in the murine melanoma cell line B16 by stable
transfection with a shRNA expression vector containing
the sequence of GLUT1 siRNA (GLUT1_shRNA1 and
GLUT1_shRNA2). B16 cells transfected with the empty
vector served as control. Quantitative RT-PCR and western
blot analysis revealed a strong downregulation of GLUT1
expression in GLUT1_shRNA compared to control cell
clones (Figure 2A, 2B). Immunohistochemical analysis
showed strong membranous GLUT1 staining in control
cells, which almost completely disappeared in GLUT1
shRNA transfected cell clones (Figure 2C). GLUT1
suppressed cells revealed significantly reduced glucose
uptake and consumption compared to control cells (Figure
2D, 2E). In line with this, lactate secretion was reduced
in GLUT1 suppressed cells (Figure 2F). Together, these
data indicate that GLUT1 is a rate-limiting factor for the

Effect of GLUT1 inhibition on B16 melanoma
cells in vitro
To further characterize the role of GLUT1 in
melanoma cells, we performed functional in vitro assays
with GLUT1 suppressed and control B16 cells. All
formed a homogenous cell layer and appeared similar
in microscopical analysis (Suppl.Figure 1). However,
GLUT1 suppression significantly reduced cell growth
(Figure 3A, Suppl.Figure 2) and impaired mitochondrial
activity as analyzed by XTT assay (Figure 3B). In
addition, GLUT1 suppressed B16 cells had significantly
higher caspase 3/7 activity (Figure 3C). Annexin V-FITC

Effect of chemical GLUT1 inhibition on
proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro

FACS analysis confirmed a higher apoptosis rate in
GLUT1 suppressed cells (Figure 3D, Suppl.Figure
3). Interestingly, Boyden chamber assays (Figure 3E)
and time-lapse scratch assays (Figure 3F, Suppl.Figure
4) revealed significantly reduced migratory activity
compared to control cells. Moreover, GLUT1 suppression
in B16 cells led to a significant reduction of the expression
of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) (Figure 3G), which
encodes for an enzyme involved in degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and tumor progression. C-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK; MAPK8) regulates a wide range
of targets in the progression and metastatic cascade of
cancer cells including proliferation, migration, attachment
and MMP-expression [21, 22]. Notably, western blot
analysis showed reduced levels of phosphorylated JNK
and c-JUN in GLUT1 suppressed cell clones (Figure
3H). In summary, these findings indicate that GLUT1
expression in malignant melanoma cells promotes their
tumorigenicity in vitro and that this is at least in part
mediated via enhanced JNK-activity.

The strongly impaired tumorigenicity of GLUT1
suppressed cell clones compared to control cells indicated
that GLUT1 inhibition is a valuable therapeutic target to
inhibit growth and metastasis of malignant melanoma
cells. To get further insight into the perspective of
potential clinical GLUT1 inhibitory strategies, we
applied WZB117, a new, highly specific small-molecule
inhibitor of GLUT1 [25], to the human melanoma cell
lines WM3211, Mel-Im and SbCl2 in vitro. In all cell
lines, incubation with WZB117 led to a dose-dependent
reduction of glucose consumption and lactate secretion
without affecting LDH levels in the supernatant (Suppl.
Figure 8A-8C). Furthermore, pharmacological GLUT1
inhibition with WZB117 reduced proliferation (Figure
5A, Suppl.Figure 9A) and XTT activity (Figure 5B, Suppl.
Figure 9B) of human melanoma cells in vitro. Conversely,
the proportion of apoptotic cells was increased when cells
were treated with WZB117 (Figure 5C, Suppl.Figure 9C).
In addition, WZB117 decreased the migratory activity of
human melanoma cells as shown by Boyden chamber and
time-lapse scratch assays (Figure 5D, 5E, Suppl.Figure
10A, 10B). WZB117 treatment also led to a significantly
reduced MMP2 expression (Figure 5F, Suppl.Figure
10C). Western blot analysis revealed decreased amounts
of phosphorylated JNK and c-JUN in melanoma cells
treated with WZB117 (Figure 5G, Suppl.Figure 10D).
Importantly, incubation of primary human hepatocytes
with WZB117 in even higher doses than applied in
melanoma cells did not decrease viability or glucose
uptake (data not shown). In summary, pharmacological
GLUT1 inhibition in human melanoma cells revealed
comparable anti-tumorigenic effects as observed in murine
B16 melanoma cells with shRNA-suppressed GLUT1
expression.

Effect of GLUT1 inhibition on hepatic metastasis
of melanoma cells in vivo
To test the effect of GLUT1 on tumor metastasis in
vivo, we employed an established syngeneic murine model
of hepatic metastasis [23] using GLUT1 suppressed and
control B16 cell clones. Macroscopic analysis showed
less metastases on the liver surface of mice injected with
GLUT1 suppressed cell clones (Figure 4A). Also serum
levels of transaminases were significantly lower in these
mice reflecting reduced hepatic tumor burden (Suppl.
Figure 5). Histological analysis confirmed that GLUT1
suppressed melanoma cells formed significantly less
hepatic metastases (Figure 4B). Furthermore, metastases
derived from GLUT1 suppressed cell clones tended
to be smaller, but differences did not reach the level of
significance (Suppl.Figure 6). Quantitative RT-PCR
analysis verified reduced GLUT1 mRNA expression
in tumors formed by B16 cell clones stably transfected
with GLUT1 shRNA (Figure 4D). Immunohistochemical
analysis confirmed significantly stronger, membranous
GLUT1 staining in vital areas of metastases formed
by control cells clones compared to GLUT1 shRNA
cell clones (Figure 4C). In both, control and GLUT1
suppressed clones, staining intensity increased from the
border of the metastases to the center (Figure 4C and
Suppl.Figure 7). Most likely, this resulted from increased
hypoxia in the center of the metastases, as GLUT1
expression is known to be induced by hypoxia [24]. In line
with the in vitro data, TUNEL staining revealed significant
more apoptosis in hepatic metastases formed by GLUT1
suppressed cells (Figure 4E). In summary, these data
demonstrate that GLUT1 expression advances metastasis
of melanoma cells in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Malignant melanomas have unique tumor biology
and unpredictable patterns of metastasis. The aim of
this study was to analyze the expression and function of
GLUT1 in the progression of this highly aggressive form
of skin cancer.
Increased GLUT1 expression has been demonstrated
in several types of human tumors compared to noncancerous tissues [7, 8, 24, 26-28]. However, most of the
published reports studied epithelial neoplasms, whereas
nevi and malignant melanomas arise from melanocytes,
which originate from the neural crest, and it is well known
that melanocytes and derived cancerous cells have unique
metabolic pathways that may interfere with glycolysis.
Previous studies of GLUT1 expression in melanoma
have shown inconclusive and in part opposite results.

Applying western blot technique, Wachsberger et al.
observed a strong variation in GLUT1 levels in primary
melanoma tissues but did not compare expression levels
with non-malignant tissues [17]. Baer et al. and Parente
et al. reported less frequent GLUT1 in melanomas as
compared to melanocytic nevi and the majority of Spitz
nevi [18, 29]. However, they analyzed only small numbers
of specimens. In contrast, a recent study by Slominski et
al. showed significantly higher levels of GLUT1 in 75
melanomas compared to 26 melanocytic nevi [19]. Here,
we confirmed the increased GLUT1 expression in 78
melanomas compared with 128 nevi. Most importantly,
we found that GLUT1 expression in primary melanomas

was an indicator for progression free- and overall survival.
Previous studies reported various associations between
GLUT1 expression and tumor aggressiveness and a poor
prognosis in a number of other malignancies including
pancreatic, pulmonary, colorectal, hepatocellular,
ovarian and squamous cell carcinoma [27, 28, 30-32].
One explanation for the correlation between GLUT1
expression and a poor prognosis in melanoma and other
types of cancer may be an increased utilization of energy
and faster cell growth. Indeed, we and others have shown
in the past that GLUT1 expression levels in various cancer
cell types correlate with induced glycolytic activity and
increased proliferation [14, 26, 33, 34]. Here, we show

that also in melanoma cells GLUT1 expression promotes
glucose uptake and cell growth. And also in human
melanoma tissues, we found a significant correlation
between GLUT1 expression and mitotic activity. Thus,
induction of the growth of the primary tumor appears as
one mechanism by which GLUT1 expression induces
melanoma progression and metastasis.
In addition, we identified further mechanisms by
which GLUT1 levels induce metastasis of melanoma
cells. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are degradative
enzymes that play an important role in all aspects of tumor
progression by enhancing tumor-induced angiogenesis.
Furthermore, MMPs destroy the local tissue architecture
and basement membranes allowing tumor invasion and
metastasis [35]. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of
GLUT1 inhibition lowers MMP2 expression in melanoma
cells. MMP2 has been shown to be associated with
melanoma progression [36, 37]. Moreover, we newly
found that GLUT1 inhibits apoptosis of melanoma cells
in vitro and in vivo. Hereby, we identified one further
mechanism by which GLUT1 promotes melanoma
growth and metastasis. JNK regulates a wide range of
targets in the metastatic cascade [21]. Also in melanoma,
this pathway is a critical regulator of tumor progression
[22, 38]. Noteworthy, we observed that GLUT1 inhibition
caused a significant inhibition of JNK-activity. To the
best of our knowledge, impairment of glycolysis or
components of the glycolytic cascade, respectively, has
not been connected with MAPK-activity. Our data indicate
that the protumorigenic effects of GLUT1 in melanoma
are at least in part mediated via JNK-activation.
In the light of the direct impact of GLUT1
expression on different protumorigenic mechanisms
in melanoma, it was important that we further found
that melanoma metastases revealed stronger GLUT1
expression than primary human melanomas, which was
in line with a previous study from Mihic-Probst et al.
[39]. The focus of this elegant study was vasculogenic
mimicry and neovascularization in human melanoma, and
the authors observed an inverse correlation between blood
vessel number and GLUT1 expression. Consequently,
they suggested that the hypoxic microenvironment in
metastases contributes to GLUT1 expression. Moreover,
Lee et al. analyzed GLUT1 expression in pulmonary
metastases of melanoma patients and found that
GLUT1 staining intensity was a significant predictor of
postmetastasectomy survival [40]. Together with our new
findings in melanoma, these studies indicate that there may
be at least two mechanisms which explain higher GLUT1
expression in melanoma metastases: (i) origin from
primary tumors with already higher expression levels and
(ii) additional induction by hypoxia or other environmental
factors at the place of metastasis. Furthermore, these
data indicate GLUT1 expression in primary tumors and
melanoma metastases as potential prognostic marker or
marker for therapeutic decisions, respectively. If biopsied
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tissue is not available, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron
emission tomography (FDG-PET) can be used for clinical
evaluation and quantification of glycolytic phenotype and
a surrogate for GLUT1 expression in malignant melanoma
(metastases). Park et al. described a positive correlation
between FDG uptake and GLUT1 expression in metastases
of melanoma patients [15]. Also several other reports
indicate that the expression of GLUT1 correlates with
the uptake of the glucose analogue 18F-FDG in a variety
of human tumors [41-43]. Moreover, Baudy et al. found
that 18F-FDG can be a sensitive biomarker for assessing
efficacy and also resistance to the BRAF inhibitor
vemurafenib [44]. Mechanistically, they found that this
resistance was associated with the induction of GLUT1.
Other studies indicate that FDG-PET correlated with
the response to further classes of chemotherapeutics in
melanoma patients [45, 46]. Furthermore, Giammarioli et
al. showed that inhibition of glucose metabolism by using
glucose analogue 2-Deoxy-D-glucose acted synergistic
with cisplatin against melanoma cells in vitro [47]. Still,
to the best of our knowledge there are no studies analyzing
the effect of GLUT1 inhibition in melanoma cells on
the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents and on therapy
resistance, respectively. However, studies in several other
cancer cells such as colon, hepatocellular, head and neck
or oral squamous cell carcinoma indicate that GLUT1
inhibition may be considered an additional treatment
option for resistant forms of cancers [48-50].
The therapeutic potential of GLUT1 inhibitory
strategies alone or together with other therapeutic
strategies in (metastatic) melanoma is yet to be determined,
but our data provide additional evidence to pursue such
studies. Furthermore, our findings promote GLUT1 levels
in primary melanoma tissues as well as in metastases as a
prognostic marker for this highly aggressive tumor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture
The murine melanoma cell line B16 and the human
melanoma cell lines Mel-Im, SbCl2 and WM3211 were
cultured as described [23]. For some experiments, cells
were treated with the small-molecule GLUT1-inhibitor
WZB117 (EMD Chemicals, San Diego, CA, USA)
[25] with different concentrations and time periods as
indicated. The vehicle DMSO alone served as control.

Stable transfection of B16 melanoma cells
A panel of B16 cell clones with decreased GLUT1
expression were established by stable transfection with
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmids containing either
antisense GLUT1-shRNA and neomycin resistance
32756

(shRNA1, shRNA2; Sure Silencing shRNA Plasmid,
Mouse Slc2a1, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or neomycin
resistance alone (ctrl; Sure Silencing shRNA Plasmid,
Negative Control-Neomycin, Qiagen) as described [23].
Paraffin-embedded pellets of cultured cells were generated
using Shandon Cytoblock Cell Block Preparation System
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the
supplier’s instructions.

1 : 2,500) were used as secondary antibodies.

Histological and immunohistological analyses
For immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin and
eosin (HE) staining, standard 5 µm sections of formalinﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded tissue blocks were used.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed using
the following antibodies as described [51]: anti-GLUT1
(Thermo Scientific, RB-9052, 1 : 100), anti-KI67 (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK; MIB1, 1 : 50). Immunohistochemical
stainings were counterstained with hematoxylin. For
analysis of the TMA, GLUT1 staining intensity was
scored semiquantitatively as 0, 1 or 2. The staining
intensity was defined as negative (score 0), weak (score 1)
and strong (score 2) with reference to the immunostaining
of erythrocytes, which were scored as strong. The GLUT1
score was specified based on the staining intensity of the
majority of melanoma cells. Representative examples of
melanoma specimens with these three GLUT1 staining
intensities are depicted in Figure 1A (right panel).

Human malignant melanoma tissue micro array
(TMA)
A tissue micro array (TMA) comprising specimens
from benign nevi, primary human melanoma and
melanoma metastases was constructed as described [20].
Clinicopathological patient characteristics are summarized
in Table 1. The median follow up for all patients was
54 months (range 1-135 months). The University of
Regensburg Institutional Review Board granted approval
for the project.

Analysis of mRNA expression

Glucose uptake

Isolation of total cellular RNA from cells and tissues
and reverse transcription were performed as described
[51]. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed applying
LightCycler technology (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
[51] and the following pairs of primers: human GLUT1
(forward: 5’- AAC TCT TCA GCC AGG GTC CAC;
reverse: 5’-CAC AGT GAA GAT GAT GAA GAC) and
human MMP2 (forward: 5’-GCT GGG AGC ATG GCG
ATG GAT ACC-3’; reverse: 5’-GGA CAG AAG CCG
TAC TTG CCA TCC-3’). Murine GLUT1 and murine
MMP2 mRNA expression analyses were performed using
QuantiTect Primer Assays according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen). Amplification of cDNA derived
from 18S rRNA (forward: 5’-AAA CGG CTA CCA CAT
CCA AG-3’; reverse: 5’-CCT CCA ATG GAT CCT CGT
TA-3’) was used for normalization.

Glucose uptake was measured by incubating cells
with 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2Deoxyglucose (2-NBDG; Thermo Scientific N13195) and
subsequent fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis as described [26].

Proliferation and mitochondrial activity assays
Cell proliferation was measured using the
xCELLigence system (Roche) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In addition, cell proliferation
was determined by cell counting. Here, 1 x 106 cells were
seeded into T75 flasks. After 48h, cells were trypsinized
and microscopically counted. Mitochondrial activity was
measured applying a colorimetric XTT assay (Roche)
[51].

Protein analysis

Caspase-3/7 activity assay, annexin V-FITC FACS
analysis and TUNEL assay

Protein extraction and western blotting were
performed as described [51] applying the following
primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-GLUT1
(Thermo Scientific, RB-9052, 1 : 1,000), rabbit
polyclonal anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Cell Signaling
Technology, Leiden, The Netherlands; #9251, 1 : 1,000),
rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-c-JUN (Cell Signaling
Technology, #3270, 1 : 1,000) and mouse monoclonal

Caspase-3/7 activity was analyzed using the
Apo-One homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay (Promega,
Mannheim, Germany) as described [52]. For detection
of apoptosis, cells were stained simultaneously with
FITC-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (both
Promokine, Heidelberg, Germany) and analyzed by flow
cytometry as described [52]. Flowing Software™ version
2.51 (Perttu Terho, Turku, Finland) was used for FACS
data analysis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end labeling staining (TUNEL,
32757

Oncotarget

Promega) was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For statistical analysis, TUNEL positive cells
were counted in 4 representative sections per sample.

Microscopical images were taken using an
Olympus™ CKX41 microscope with the ALTRA 20
Soft Imaging System™ and CellA software version 2.6
(Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH, Münster,
Germany). Images were processed using IrfanView™
software version 4.36 (Irfan Skiljan, Jajce, Bosnia).

Analysis of migratiory activity of melanoma cells
in vitro

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Migratory activity of melanoma cells was quantified
using Cultrex 96 Well Cell Migration assay (Trevigen,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) as described [26]. Further, cell
migration was assessed applying time-lapse scratch assays
(‘wound-healing-assay’) as described [53]. Briefly, nearly
confluent cell monolayers were scratched and migration
of cells into the wounded area was monitored throughout
a 24h time window.

We are indebted to Birgitta Ott-Rötzer, Ruth
Schewior, Marina Fink, Margit Nützel and Rudolf Jung,
for excellent technical assistance. Furthermore, we want
to thank Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Insitute, Philadelphia,
USA) for providing SbCl2 and WM3211 human
melanoma cell lines.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

In vivo metastasis assay

The authors declare that they do have no conflict of
interest.

To determine the metastatic potential of murine
B16 melanoma cells in vivo, a mouse model of hepatic
metastasis was used [23]. Monodispersed tumor cells (1
x 106 in 50µl) were injected into the spleen of syngeneic
Bl/6N mice (n = 7 per group; age: 16 weeks, mean
bodyweight: 24g; Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld,
Germany). After 11 days, mice were sacrificed and the
livers were processed for further analyses.
All experimental protocols were approved by
the Committee on Animal Health and Care of the local
government, and conformed to international guidelines on
the ethical use of animals.

Statistical analysis and image acquisition tools
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Comparison
between groups was made using ordinary one-way
ANOVA. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Contingency table analysis and two-sided
Fisher’s exact tests were used to study the statistical
association between categorical clinicopathological
and immunohistochemical variables. Retrospective
overall survival and progression-free survival curves
comparing patients with and without any of the variables
were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with
significance evaluated using log-rank statistics. For the
progression-free survival analysis, patients were censored
at the time of their last tumor-free clinical follow-up
appointment. For the overall survival analysis, patients
were censored at the time of their last clinical follow-up
appointment. Median overall survival time for censored
patients was 63.5 months (range: 3-135 months).
Calculations were performed by using the GraphPad
Prism Software version 6.01 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA, USA) and SPSS Software version 21.0 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA).
