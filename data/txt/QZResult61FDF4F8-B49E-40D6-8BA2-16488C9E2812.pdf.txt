Abstract
Cancer patients receiving epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) antibody therapy often experience an acneiform rash
of uncertain etiology in skin regions rich in pilosebaceous
units. Currently, this condition is treated symptomatically
with very limited, often anecdotal success. Here, we show that
a monoclonal antibody targeting murine EGFR, ME1, caused a
neutrophil-rich hair follicle inflammation in mice, similar to
that reported in patients. This effect was preceded by the
appearance of lipid-filled hair follicle distensions adjacent to
enlarged sebaceous glands. The cytokine tumor necrosis
factor-A (TNFA), localized immunohistochemically to this
affected region of the pilosebaceous unit, was specifically upregulated by ME1 in skin but not in other tissues examined.
Moreover, skin inflammation was reduced by cotreatment
with the TNFA signaling inhibitor, etanercept, indicating the
involvement of TNFA in this inflammatory process. Interleukin-1, a cytokine that frequently acts in concert with TNFA, is
also involved in this process given the efficacy of the
interleukin-1 antagonist Kineret. Our results provide a
mechanistic framework to develop evidence-based trials for
EGFR antibody–induced skin rash in patients with cancer.

Introduction
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a membrane protein
controlling proliferation and maturation of normal epithelial cells
in skin, as well as cancer cells of epithelial origin (1, 2). EGFR
targeting with the antibodies cetuximab and panitumumub is
approved for the management of several cancer types. However,
these agents also cause an inflammatory ‘‘acneiform’’ rash in skin
regions rich in pilosebaceous units (3, 4). Skin inflammation
develops days after the start of treatment with reddened elevations
of the skin that may subsequently contain pus. Histologically,
affected skin regions often present with neutrophil-rich inflammation in the superficial dermis and hair follicles (3, 5). Treatments
for this rash are, at present, symptomatic due to uncertain etiology.

To aid in the development of mechanism-based treatment
approaches, we have developed an animal model of EGFR
antibody–induced skin inflammation using a rat monoclonal
antibody targeting mouse EGFR, ME1 (6). Although the role of B
cells and T cells in this inflammatory process has not been
determined, a model was established in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice that lack these cells, but retain neutrophils, to
ensure that skin-inflammatory effects in our model were not due to
an adaptive immune response to the foreign rat antibody ME1.

Materials and Methods
ME1 binding to mouse EGFR. ME1 (ImClone Systems) binding to
recombinant human Fc-tagged mouse EGFR was determined by ELISA.
Animal models and dosing. Animal studies used female SCID mice
(Charles River Laboratories), in accordance with current regulations and
standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the NIH. ME1, rat IgG
(Equitech-Bio) and cetuximab (ImClone Systems) were administered i.p. at
40 mg/kg (Monday–Wednesday–Friday). Kineret (Amgen; 150 mg/kg) and
etanercept (Immunex; 12.5 or 25 mg/kg) were administered i.p., daily.
Human IgG (Meridian Life Science) was used as a control for cetuximab and
etanercept. Subcutaneous xenografts were established in the flank region
with 5  106 GEO cells per mouse in 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences).
Skin histology. Frozen (12 Am) or paraffinized (5 Am) skin sections were
stained immunohistochemically with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine as chromagen,
and/or with standard counterstaining methods.
Tumor necrosis factor-A, interleukin-1A, and interleukin-1B
protein analysis. Cytokines were measured in skin homogenate and
plasma with mouse-specific ELISA kits (R&D Systems).
Tumor necrosis factor-A, interleukin-1A, and interleukin-1B RNA
analysis. Cytokine RNA expression was measured in perfused skin samples
with Quantigene 2.0, 96-well plate assay kits (Panomics).
Statistical analyses. Skin cytokine levels, tissue mRNA levels, and the
percentage of skin length with a neutrophil-rich inflammation from the
study in which etanercept or Kineret treatment were started after 19 d of
ME1 therapy were compared with a Wilcoxon rank sums test using JMP
software from SAS. Tumor weights among the mice receiving anti-EGFR
therapy, as well as plasma cytokine levels, were compared by one-way
ANOVA followed by a Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. The percentage of skin
length with a neutrophil-rich inflammation from the three pooled studies in
which treatment was started 1 day prior to ME1 therapy was compared by
standard least squares regression, with study and treatment as factors. For
all analyses, n = number of mice and P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results and Discussion
ME1 bound mouse EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S1) and caused a
wavy hair phenotype in SCID mice (Fig. 1A), also reported for
genetically engineered mice deficient in EGFR signaling (7).

Furthermore, ME1 prevented hair regrowth after shaving
(Fig. 1B), similar to effects reported for a small molecule EGFR
inhibitor (8).
Upon observing a yellowish crusting of the skin surface in shaved
areas after 2 weeks of ME1 treatment, skin samples were harvested
for histologic evaluation. ME1-treated skin showed the hallmarks
of skin inflammation observed in patients treated with EGFR
antibodies (4, 5), i.e., hair follicle plugging, pus-like neutrophil
clusters outside the hair follicle canal, parakeratosis (retention of
nuclei in stratum corneum cells), and ectatic (dilated) follicles
(Fig. 1C). Neutrophil-rich inflammation with epidermal thickening
was prominent in unshaved ME1-treated skin of the face and
shoulders (Fig. 1D). In contrast, lower back skin inflammation was
only significant when this region was shaved prior to the start of
ME1 treatment, possibly related to the suggestion that patients
may require additional stimuli (triggers) beyond EGFR inhibition to
develop a skin rash (4).
Notably, ME1 treatment significantly increased the size of
sebaceous glands in all skin regions (Fig. 1D; Supplementary

Fig. S2), supporting a potential role for sebaceous glands in
EGFR inhibitor–induced skin rash (3). Sebaceous glands, the
overactivity of which is associated with acne vulgaris (9),
predominately consist of mature oil-producing, EGFR-expressing
sebocytes (ref. 10; Supplementary Fig. S3), that end their life
cycle by disintegrating in a holocrine secretion process,
releasing their contents into the hair follicle canal through a
sebaceous duct.
In EGFR antibody–treated patients, skin rash begins f1 to
3 weeks after the start of treatment (3, 5). In an effort to uncover
the effects of ME1 preceding, and therefore, potentially contributing towards the development of skin inflammation, we next
evaluated shoulder and lower back skin samples from unshaved
mice after just 1 week of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4). ME1
consistently increased the size of sebaceous glands, even prior to
the onset of inflammation. Interestingly, enlarged sebaceous glands
were observed to feed into oil-filled follicular distensions near
sebaceous ducts in ME1-treated skin, but not in control skin
(Fig. 2A). Antibody-mediated inhibition of EGFR may therefore

result in overactive sebaceous glands, in line with reports of
reduced sebocyte maturation and oil production when EGFR is
activated with ligands in vitro (11, 12). The general location of oilfilled follicular distensions induced by 1 week of ME1 treatment
was similar to that of early observations of neutrophil-rich hair
follicle inflammation (Fig. 2B).
The normal sebaceous gland of human and mouse skin is
reported to express tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa; ref. 13), an
inflammatory cytokine that can cause neutrophilic skin inflammation (14). In control SCID mice, TNFa immunoreactivity was
predominantly localized to the vicinity of the hair follicle sebaceous
ducts and sebocytes (Fig. 2C). After 7 days of ME1 treatment, TNFa
immunostaining remained focused on sebocytes and the adjacent
distended follicular canals.
Beyond simply increasing the size of the skin region highest in
TNFa, ME1 significantly increased TNFa protein levels in skin after
7 days (P < 0.008), but not after 1 or 3 days of treatment (Fig. 3A).
TNFa mRNA was similarly increased in ME1-treated skin, but not
in other tissues (Fig. 3B; P < 0.03). This skin-focused tissue pattern
of increased TNFa production is notably similar to that of EGFR
antibody–associated toxicities in patients (3).
The above data support the hypothesis that targeting EGFR with
ME1 increases sebocyte maturation, eventually resulting in
sebaceous gland hypertrophy, follicular distension, and increased
skin TNFa levels that could contribute towards skin inflammation.
We therefore evaluated the effects of a concomitantly administered
TNFa antagonist on GR-1–positive neutrophil-rich skin inflammation associated with ME1 treatment. To account for interstudy
variability in ME1-induced skin inflammation potentially related to
variation in triggers for rash that act with or apart from EGFR
targeting, results were pooled from three studies evaluating therapy
with etanercept, a fusion protein containing two extracellular
domains from the human p75 TNFa receptor, joined to a single
human IgG1 Fc region.
ME1 increased neutrophilic skin inflammation in all three
regions examined, especially the face and shoulder (P < 0.0001).
Etanercept reduced this inflammation when daily treatment was
started 1 day prior to the start of ME1 dosing (Fig. 4A;
Supplementary Fig. S5; P < 0.002 for the face and shoulder,
P < 0.02 for the lower back). The effects of ME1 were independent
of the study used in the pooled analysis, although the effects of
etanercept on facial skin inflammation varied between studies
(P = 0.0002). This variation was due to a weaker effect on the
ME1-aggravated facial rash associated with an eye irritation
observed in one of the three pooled studies; even observed in the
control mice not receiving ME1 (Fig. 4A).
Importantly, in a fourth efficacy study not included in the
analysis, ME1 failed to induce skin inflammation through day 19
of treatment, despite a 70% increase in plasma TNFa in ME1treated mice (P < 0.05; data not shown). The lack of a rash
following 19 days of ME1 treatment in this study, observations of
elevated TNFa mRNA in an ME1-treated skin region rarely showing
inflammation (lower back skin; Figs. 3 and 4A), and observations of
skin rash in mice not receiving ME1 (Supplementary Fig. S6)
support the conclusion that ME1, in conjunction with shaving or
other as yet unidentified, perhaps environmental triggers, predisposes skin to a generally normal inflammatory process, at least in
part through increased local TNFa production (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
TNFa frequently acts in concert with interleukin-1 (IL-1; refs. 15,
16). Although IL-1a and IL-1h protein levels in skin never exceeded

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

the detection limits of our assays through 7 days of ME1 therapy
(data not shown); IL-1a and IL-1h mRNA were detectable and
showed trends for increase in various tissues (Supplementary
Fig. S7), without the skin-focused pattern observed for TNFa. In

line with an important role for IL-1 signaling in this model,
recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, Kineret, reduced inflammatory skin rash in ME1-treated mice, independent of the study
(Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S5; P < 0.0007 for the face and
shoulder, P = 0.06 for the lower back). Importantly, whereas
neutrophilic infiltrates of the skin were significantly reduced with
either etanercept or Kineret, neither treatment prevented the
occurrence of wavy hair, sebaceous gland enlargement, or hair
follicle distension (Supplementary Fig. S8). TNFa and IL-1 therefore
act downstream of these effects of ME1 to predispose mice to hair
follicle inflammation.
IL-1 might act upstream of TNFa in some instances (17). In the
present model however, in 2 of 3 studies, Kineret did not
significantly reduce an ME1 induced increase in plasma TNFa
(Fig. 4B). However, in a third study, Kineret lowered plasma TNFa
(data not shown), indicating that further evaluation is necessary. In
contrast, etanercept blocked an increase in plasma IL-1a in three
of three studies (Fig. 4B), supporting the possibility that TNFa acts
upstream of IL-1 signaling in mediating the inflammatory effects of
ME1.
From day 19 to day 36 of ME1 treatment, skin inflammation
tended to decrease in severity in the face, while spreading caudally
to the lower back (Supplementary Fig. S9). When the start of
Kineret and etanercept treatments were delayed to day 19, positive
effects were again observed, although they did not reach statistical
significance (P > 0.06). ME1 treatment cessation (switch to Rat IgG
on day 19) significantly reduced rash on the face and shoulder, and
minimized its spread to the lower back (P < 0.02).
TNFa has the potential to accelerate (18, 19) or impede (20)
cancer progression. Thus, systemic administration of TNFa
inhibitors, while alleviating the skin rash during EGFR antibody
therapy, may also affect anticancer efficacy. To begin to explore this
important consideration, we evaluated the effects of etanercept

and Kineret on the efficacy of combined antibody-mediated
inhibition of mouse (ME1) and human (cetuximab) EGFR in a
SCID mouse subcutaneous xenograft tumor model, established
with GEO human colorectal cancer cells. Kineret had no significant
effect on the antitumor effect of anti-EGFR therapy, but a moderate
loss of efficacy was observed with etanercept (Fig. 4C). Although
additional testing is still necessary to determine the general
applicability of this finding in other tumors, the results do suggest
that TNFa may augment the antitumor effects of EGFR antibody–
targeted therapy.
In conclusion, current treatment guidelines for EGFR antibody–
induced skin rash have not been developed with the benefits of
an understanding of the underlying mechanism. Here, we report on
a mechanism uncovered in an animal model of this condition,
offering a rationale that can be tested further in translational
studies evaluating the importance of EGFR antibody–induced
TNFa and IL-1 signaling in predisposing patients to skin
inflammation.
