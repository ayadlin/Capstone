ABSTRACT
MiRNA-15a/16-1 cluster located at chromosome 13q14 has been confirmed to
regulate critical genes associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis and drug resistance
in multiple myeloma (MM). However, little is known about their expression pattern
and prognostic value in MM patients. In this study, we have analyzed the expression
levels of miR-15a/16-1 in 117 MM patients (90 newly diagnosed, 11 relapsed and
16 remission patients) and 19 health donors (HDs) by quantitative real-time PCR. Our
results indicated that the expression levels of miR-15a and 16-1 were down-regulated
in newly diagnosed MM patients as compared to HDs (P = 0.025; P < 0.001) and
independent of del(13q14). Downregulation of miR-15a was significantly associated
with disease progression and poor prognosis while miR-16-1 seemed to be a good
diagnostic marker to distinguish MM from HDs with area under the curve (AUC) of
0.864, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 73%. Furthermore, patients with
miR-15a < 2.35 (low expression group) had significantly shorter PFS (P < 0.001) and
OS (P < 0.001). After adjustment of the established prognostic variables including
del(13q), del(17p), amp(1q21) and high risk genetic abnormality, low miR-15a
expression (<2.35) was still a powerful independent predictor for PFS (P = 0.008) and
OS (P = 0.038). In addition, miR-15a combined with high β2-MG and high risk genetic
abnormality can further identify the high-risk subpopulations. Therefore, our data
suggest that the expression patterns of miR-15a/16-1 are different in MM patients,
and miR-15a seems to be linked with disease progression and prognosis while
miR-16-1 acts as a valuable diagnostic marker.

evidences have shown that miRNAs play a critical role
in the pathogenesis of human tumors and are also found
to be valuable markers for predicting the diagnosis,
risk-stratification and clinical outcomes [3, 4]. In 2013,
Wu et al. first suggested that miRNAs could be built
into molecular diagnostic strategies for improving
the International Staging System (ISS)/FISH-based
risk stratification and were even independent of gene
expression profiles (GEP) signatures based approach that
has been considered as important predictors to classify
the different clinical outcomes in MM patients [5].

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell
malignancy characterized by complex chromosomal
instability. It involves both numerical and structural
aberrations that are recognized as the most important
factors for providing the potential prognostic relevance
and guidance for the therapeutic strategies [1, 2].
The routine evaluation factors consist of 17p deletion
(del(17p)), t(4;14) and t(14;16) detected by fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) [2]. In recent years, increasing

patients and HDs (2.83 vs. 3.51, P < 0.001) (Figure 1B).
Since miR-15a and miR-16-1 are closely located on
the chromosome 13q14 region, we next analyzed their
correlation and observed that the expression levels of miR15a and miR-16-1 were positively correlated (r = 0.458,
P < 0.001) as seen in Figure 1C.

To date, although many miRNAs dysregulations in MM
have already been reported, their expression patterns and
prognostic impacts on MM patients remain elusive.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, approximately
18–22-nucleotide non-coding RNA molecules that
negatively regulate posttranscriptional gene expression
by binding to the 3′-untranslated region of their target
transcripts. MiR-15a/16-1 cluster, closely located at
chromosome 13q14, was considered to have similar
tumor suppressor functions involved in cell differentiation,
proliferation, apoptosis or angiogenesis in several human
tumors including MM [6–10]. Our previous studies
indicated that miR-15a/16-1 downregulation contributed
to the myeloma pathogenesis and mediates drug resistance
in myeloma cells [11, 12]. However, their expression
patterns and the ability to predict diagnosis and clinical
outcome in MM patients are still unclear. Therefore, in this
study we investigated the expression of miR-15a/16-1 and
their subsequent clinical predictive values in MM patients.

Downregulation of miR-15a is linked with
disease progression while miR-16-1 seems to be a
good diagnostic marker in MM
It is worthy to note, we observed that there was a
greater variation in miR-15a expression than in miR-16-1
expression among different newly diagnosed patients. The
expression levels of miR-15a in newly diagnosed patients
ranged from 0.96 to 6.39, with the mean value of 3.42
and standard deviation (SD) of 1.0, while it ranged from
3.15 to 4.62 in HDs, with the mean value of 3.75 and SD
of 0.46 as seen in Figure 2A. In contrast, the expression
levels of miR-16-1 in newly diagnosed patients ranged
from 0.92 to 5.1, with the mean value of 2.83 and SD of
0.75, while it ranged from 2.64 to 4.28 in HDs, with the
mean of 3.51 and SD of 0.45 (Figure 2B). Moreover, it
is important to note here that the observed correlation
coefficient between the expression levels of miR-15a and
miR-16-1 was moderate (r = 0.458), suggesting that there
is the potential possibility of difference in their expression
pattern and clinical significance although with the similar
down-regulation trend in newly diagnosed patients.
To understand the meaning of miR-15a/16-1
downregulation in newly diagnosed MM patients, we
further compared the expression levels of miR-15a/16-1
in patients at different stages of disease. The results
showed miR-15a was obviously down-regulated in newly
diagnosed patients but restored close to HDs levels at the
remission phase. However, the levels of miR-15a returned
to diagnostic levels upon relapse (Figure 1A and 2A).
However, although miR-16-1 was also obviously downregulated in newly diagnosed and relapsed patients, the
levels of miR-16-1 didn’t restore to HDs levels at the
remission phase (Figure 1B and 2B). We further analyzed
the correlation between their expression levels and clinical
characteristics. Here, we found that patients with disease
progression (P = 0.04) (Figure 2C) and death (P = 0.012)
(Figure 2D) had lower levels of miR-15a. However, we
didn’t find any correlation between clinical characteristics
and miR-16-1 expression.
Next, we compared the ability of miR-15a and
miR-16-1 to distinguish MM patients from HDs using
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The
results showed that the levels of miR-16-1 can be used
to distinguish MM patients from HDs with area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.864 (P < 0.001), sensitivity of 100%
and specificity of 73% (Figure 2F). While the AUC for
miR-15a was only 0.664 (P = 0.025) and the sensitivity
and specificity were 78.9% and 56.7%, respectively

RESULTS
Patient’s characteristics
A total of 90 newly diagnosed MM patients
including 44 IgG type, 26 IgA type, 6 IgD type and
14 light chain type were enrolled in this study. Among
these patients, 55 were males and 35 were females. The
median age of the patients was 58 years old (range,
40–79 yr). The clinical characteristics and miR-15a/16-1
expression levels of the 90 newly diagnosed patients are
shown in Table 1. Among the newly diagnosed patients,
49 received thalidomide-based treatment (Arm A) and
41 received bortezomib-based treatment (Arm B). There
were no significant differences in clinical and cytogenetic
characteristics between Arm A and B (Supplemental data,
Table 1).
In addition, we also enrolled 11 relapsed and
16  remission (≥VGPR, very good partial remission)
MM patients for comparing the miR-15a/16-1 expression
at different stages of disease. Due to limited samples
and follow-up time, only three paired samples (newly
diagnosed and relapsed patients) and a paired of newly
diagnosed and remission sample were included in this
study. The clinical characteristics of 16 remission patients
are described in the Supplementary Table 2.

MiR-15a and miR-16-1 expression levels are
down-regulated and positively correlated in
newly diagnosed MM patients
As shown in Figure 1A, miR-15a expression was
significantly down-regulated in newly diagnosed MM
patients compared to HDs (3.42 vs. 3.75, P = 0.025).
Similarly, the expression of miR-16-1 also displayed
a down-regulated trend between the newly diagnosed

Figure 1: Comparison of miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression among 90 newly diagnosed, 11 relapsed, 16 remission MM
patients and 19 healthy donors (HDs). A. MiR-15a is obviously down-regulated in newly diagnosed and relapsed patients compared

to HDs (P = 0.025, P < 0.001); however, it restores to HDs level from relapsed to remission status (P = 0.017). B. MiR-16-1 is obviously
down-regulated in newly diagnosed and relapsed patients compared to HDs (P < 0.001, P = 0.002); however, it didn’t restore to HDs levels
from relapsed to remission status (P = 0.285). C. The expression levels of miR-15a and miR-16-1 were positively correlated (r = 0.458,
P < 0.001). (* means P < 0.05; ** means P < 0.01; *** means P < 0.001).

MiR-15a and miR-16-1 expression levels are
independent of the chromosome 13q14 deletion

(Figure  2E). These results confirmed that the variation
in miR-15a expression in myeloma might be useful in
monitoring disease progression, while miR-16-1 could
be used as a good diagnostic marker to distinguish MM
patients from HDs.

Figure 2: The low miR-15a expression is a good marker for predicting disease progression while miR-16-1 seems to
be a good diagnosed marker for distinguishing MM patients from HDs. A. The expression levels of miR-15a showed more

variation with a mean 3.42 and standard deviation (SD) of 1.0 (ranged from 0.96 to 6.39) in newly diagnosed patients; while HDs, remission
and relapsed patients with the means of 3.75, 3.70 and 3.13, respectively. B. The expression levels of miR-16-1 showed a mean of 2.83

C. Patients with disease progression have lower expression levels of miR-15a than patients without progression (P = 0.04). D. The died
patients have lower expression levels of miR-15a than live patients (P = 0.012). E. The ROC curve of miR-15a showed area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.664 (P = 0.025). F. The ROC curves of miR-16-1 showed AUC of 0.864 (P < 0.001), suggesting that miR-16-1 can be used as
a better diagnosed marker to distinguish MM patients from HDs than miR-15a.

in patients with or without deletion of 13q14. Heterozygous
del(13q14) was detected in 33.3% (30/90) of the patients.
The mean levels of miR-15a expression in patients with

MiR-15a downregulation is linked with poor
survival in newly diagnosed MM patients

patients without above abnormalities. Furthermore, the
multivariate cox regression model analysis also revealed
that miR-15a was an independent prognostic factor for
PFS (HR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.09–0.71, P = 0.008) and OS
(HR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.08–0.93, P = 0.038). In addition, the
del(17p) and del (13q) also had the independent adverse
influence on PFS and OS (Table 3).
Similar ROC curve analysis based on the cut-off value
of 3.13 was performed for miR-16-1. Sixty-four patients with
miR-16-1 < 3.13 were defined as low miR-16-1 expression
group, while twenty-six patients with miR-16-1 ≥ 3.13 were
defined as high miR-16-1 expression group. However, we
didn’t find any prognositic significance of miR-16-1 in
newly diagnosed MM patients (data not shown).

Since we observed the correlation between low
miR-15a expression and disease progression and patient
survival, we next compared whether patients with
different miR-15a levels have potentially different clinical
outcomes. Using ROC curve analysis, we defined 2.35 as
a cut-off value for miR-15a expression. Seventeen patients
with miR-15a expression less than 2.35 were defined as
low miR-15a expression group, while seventy-three
patients with miR-15a ≥ 2.35 were defined as high miR-15a
expression group. The patients were followed for a
median time of 15 months (range, 3.0–55.5 months). Four
patients did not complete the follow-up examination due
to incorrect contact information.
As shown in Table 2 and Figure 3A & 3B, patients
with low miR-15a expression (<2.35) had significantly
shorter progression free survival (PFS) (14.0 months
vs. 29.0 months, P < 0.001) and overall survival (OS)
(15.0  months vs. 55.0 months, P < 0.001) than the
patients with high miR-15a expression (≥2.35). Based on
the univariate analysis as shown in Table 2, the patients
with del(13q), del(17p), amp (1q21), high-risk genetic
abnormality also showed shorter survival time than the

MiR-15a in combination with high β2-MG and
high risk genetic abnormality can further predict
high-risk subgroups in newly diagnosed MM
patients
Based on the assumptions derived from the
previous studies that miRNAs can be a valuable factor
for improving ISS/FISH-based risk stratification,
we next investigated if miR-15a in combination

Bortezomib-based therapy can’t improve the
clinical outcome of myeloma patients with low
miR-15a expression

with other factors has the potential to predict the­
high-risk subgroups. Surprisingly, we found that
miR-15a in combination with β2-MG or high risk
genetic abnormality was a good predictor for dividing
patients into subpopulations with different PFS and OS
time (Table 4). Patients with low miR-15a expression
(<2.35) and high β2-MG had worse PFS (15.0 months
vs. 18.0 months vs. not reached, P  =  0.012) and OS
(15.0 months vs. 26.0 months vs. not reached, P = 0.001)
than the patients either with high miR-15a expression
and low β2-MG or other patients (Table 4, Figure 3C and
3D). A similar analysis for the PFS and OS prediction
was also performed on the parameters of miR-15a and
high risk genetic abnormality (Table 4, Figure 3E and
3F) and the data revealed that low miR-15a expression
and high risk genetic abnormality are associated with
the worst outcomes. Based on β2-MG ≥ 5.5 mg/dL
being defined as ISS III stage, thus we thought miR-15a
in combination with ISS III stage or high risk genetic
abnormality could further select the high-risk subgroups
in newly diagnosed MM patients. These high-risk
subpopulations would have inferior clinical outcome
than those with sole abnormality and thus require more
positive therapies.

Our data have showed the low expression of
miR-15a was associated with disease progression and
poor prognosis in MM patients. We further investigated
whether miR-15a downregulation influenced the patients’
response to different therapies. Interestingly, we found
patients with low miR-15a expression had poor survival in
patients received thalidomide (Arm A) and/or bortezomib
(Arm B)-based chemotherapy (Table 5, Figure 4A-4D),
suggesting that bortezomib-based treatment didn’t
significantly improve PFS and OS of patients with miR15a low expression.

DISCUSSION
The importance of miRNAs in regulating critical
genes associated with tumorigenesis, disease progression
and drug resistance has been emphasized by many
different published studies, and their roles as valuable
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in MM has also
been highlighted [13–15]. Moreover, these dysregulated

Figure 4: Survival analysis of miR-15a in newly diagnosed MM patients with thalidomide-based or bortezomib-based
therapy. A–B. In Arm A (thalidomide-based therapy), the patients with low miR-15a expression had inferior PFS (P = 0.046) and OS

(P = 0.016). C–D. In Arm B (bortezomib-based therapy), the patients with low miR-15a expression also showed inferior PFS (P = 0.003)
and OS (P = 0.002), suggesting that bortezomib-based therapy could not improve the poor survival of patients with low miR-15a expression.

miRNAs have been confirmed to be usually located at
chromosome fragile sites that are involved in cancers [16].
The 13q14 deletion, one of the most frequent chromosomal
aberration, occurs in 16–40% of multiple myeloma, more
than or equal 50% of mantle cell lymphoma, chronic

lymphocytic leukemia and other solid tumors [6]. Previous
studies have reported that the expression of miR-15a/16-1
cluster, located at chromosome 13q14, is down-regulated
in multiple pathological processes and it functions as a
tumor suppressor gene in MM [9–12]. However, whether

These results further verify that miR-15a is a powerful
prognostic marker in newly diagnosed MM patients.
It has been demonstrated that miR-15a/16-1 is
down-regulated and functions as a tumor suppressor in
MM. Roccaro et al. [20] identified that miR-15a/16-1
regulated the proliferation of MM cells in vitro and in vivo
by inhibiting AKT serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT3),
ribosomal-protein-S6, MAP-kinases, and NF-kB activator
MAP3KIP3. Several other studies also revealed that miR15a/16-1 targeted multiple genes that are related to cell
cycle, apoptosis and angiogenesis, such as BCL2, MCL1,
CCND1, WNT3A and VEGF [21]. However, whether
there are different roles between miR-15a and 16-1 in
the pathogenesis of MM remains unclear. In this study,
our results indicated that miR-15a and 16-1 had different
expression patterns and clinical values. Patients with
lower miR-15a expression (<2.35) had inferior survival
and were even resistant to bortezomib-based therapy,
supporting that miR-15a plays more important roles in
the disease progression and drug resistance compared to
miR-16-1 in MM. Although the mechanism is unknown,
this discrepancy can be explained by the following
evidences:  1) our previous studies have indicated that
bone marrow stromal cells decrease the sensitivity of
myeloma cells to bortezomib treatment by more obviously
downregulating the expression of miR-15a than miR-16-1,
suggesting that miR-15a plays more important role in the
drug resistance to bortezomib [11, 12]. 2) Roccaro et al.
[20] investigated the clinical relevance of miR-15a/16-1
with ISS stage in MM, their results showed patients with
ISS II and III had obviously lower levels of miR-15a
but not miR-16-1, which provides the evidence for
different roles of miR-15a/16-1 in MM. In future, different
mechanisms of miR-15a/16-1 in the pathogenesis and drug
resistance in MM need further investigation.
In summary, our results indicate that miR-15a and
16-1 are down-regulated in newly diagnosed myeloma
patients but presented with different expression patterns.
MiR-15a is associated with disease progression and poor
prognosis while miR-16-1 may be a good diagnostic
marker in MM. The results of our study also provide some
important evidence for the potential clinical applications
of miR-15a/16-1.

there is difference about their expression patterns and
clinical roles in MM patients remains elusive. So we
investigated the expression status of miR-15a/16-1
and assessed their diagnostic and prognostic values in
myeloma patients.
Our results are consistent with previous published
reports that miR-15a and 16-1 are universally downregulated in newly diagnosed MM patients compared
to HDs. Interestingly, although located at tightly linked
site (13q14), miR-15a and 16-1 had different expression
patterns. MiR-15a showed more variable expression
levels than miR-16-1 in newly diagnosed patients. It was
down-regulated in newly diagnosed and relapsed patients,
however restored close to HDs level at the remission
phase. Moreover, the patients with shorter PFS and OS
had lower levels of miR-15a. However, the expression of
miR-16-1 was also down-regulated in newly diagnosed
and relapsed patients, but the level of miR-16-1 in the
patients at remission phase did not restore to HDs levels.
In addition, we also did not find any correlation among
clinical characteristics and miR-16-1 expression. To assess
the potential of miR-15a and miR-16-1 in distinguishing
MM patients from HDs, we performed ROC analysis.
Interestingly, we found that the AUC of miR-16-1 was
0.864, with 100% of sensitivity and 73% of specificity,
while miR-15a had a AUC of 0.664. These results suggest
that miR-15a is mainly associated with disease progression
while miR-16-1 could be used as a good diagnostic
marker in MM.
Several studies have also reported that the
expression levels of miR-15a/16-1 are independent of
the chromosome 13 status [17–19]. On the contrary,
Roccaro et al. [20] found that patients with del(13q)
had significantly decreased miR-15a/16-1 expression
compared to patients without del(13q). But our data are in
agreement with the previous conclusion that miR-15a/16-1
expression in MM patients is independent of the deletion
of chromosome 13q14. The reasonable explanation is that
most of the 13q14 deletions are heterozygous loss and they
may have a limited impact on the expression levels of miR15a/16-1. In addition, miR-15a/16-1 dysregulation resulted
from chromosomal instability may be another reason.
Based on the correlation between miR-15a
downregulation and disease progression and patient
survival, we also compared the prognostic value of
low miR-15a expression in newly diagnosed patients.
Our data indicated that patients with low miR-15a
expression (<2.35) had a significantly shortened PFS
and OS than patients with high miR-15a expression
(≥2.35). In multivariate analysis, miR-15a still remains
an independent prognostic factor for short PFS and OS.
Wu et al. [5] suggested that miRNAs can be built into
molecular diagnostic strategies for improving the ISS/
FISH-based risk stratification, our data also indicated
that miR-15a in combination with high β2-MG or high
risk genetic abnormality was a good prediction marker

Patients and samples
The study was approved by the ethics committee of
the Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences, and Peking Union Medical College, according
to the guidelines of the 1996 Helsinki Declaration. Bone
marrow samples were obtained from 90 newly diagnosed,
11 relapsed and 16 remission (≥VGPR, very good partial
remission) MM patients. The normal bone marrows from

Statistical analysis

19 healthy donors (HDs) were collected as controls.
Written informed consents from all patients and HDs
were obtained. Diagnostic and response criteria for MM
were referred to the recommendation by the International
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) [22].
Treatment regimens were performed as described
in previous study [23], including thalidomide-based
therapy (Arm A): TAD (thalidomide, adriamycin and
dexamethasone) or TCD (thalidomide, cyclophosphamide
and dexamethasone); and bortezomib-based therapy
(Arm B): BCD (bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and
dexamethasone) or PAD (bortezomib, adriamycin and
dexamethasone). After at least four cycles of treatments
with partial remission or better efficacy, patients
underwent consolidation therapy with the patient’s
original regimen. Subsequently, patients were treated with
thalidomide (100–150 mg/d) for one year to maintain
response.

The Log10+3 transformation of RQ value of miR15a/16-1 was used in this analysis. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine
the miR-15a/16-1 expression cut-off value. Categorical
variables were compared using nonparametric tests and
the Pearson’s Chi-square test. Progression-free survival
(PFS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis until
disease progression or death, and overall survival (OS)
was calculated from the date of diagnosis until death.
Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method
and differences between the curves were analyzed for
statistical significance using the log-rank test. Multivariate
analysis of variables associated with survival was
conducted by cox proportional-hazard model for both
PFS and OS. A statistically significant difference was
considered at P ≤ 0.05. Statistical analysis was conducted
using SPSS version 19.0 software.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

Mononuclear cells from different disease status
of MM patients were separated by gradient density
centrifugation. Plasma cells were then sorted using
CD138-coated magnetic beads, which enabled plasma
cell purity higher than 90%. Plasma cells were analyzed
for the following chromosomal aberrations; del(13q14),
del(17p), amp(1q21), IgH translocation, t(11;14),
t(4;14), and t(14;16). FISH analysis was performed
as reported previously [24]. At least 200 cells with
well-delineated signals were evaluated. The cut-off
level was set at 20% for numerical abnormalities and
10% for fusion or break-apart probes according to the
recommendation by the European Myeloma Network
(EMN) [25].

Quantitative RT-PCR for miR-15a/16-1

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Total RNA was extracted from purified CD138+
cells in a single step method using the mirVana™
miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The
expression of miR-15a/16-1 was measured using the
TaqMan microRNA quantitative PCR system (Applied
Biosystems, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The 10 ng of
total RNA was reverse transcribed using the microRNA
reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) and a
specific reverse transcription stem-loop primer according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. All reactions
were run in duplicate. Normalization was performed with
RNU48. DCt was calculated by subtracting the Ct value
of RNU48 (Applied Biosystems) from the Ct value of
miR-15a/16-1. The relative quantitative (RQ) values of
miR-15a/16-1 were expressed as fold change of the miR15a/16-1 relative to the expression in the MM cell line
