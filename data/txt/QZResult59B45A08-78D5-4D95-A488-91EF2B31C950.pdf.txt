ABSTRACT
CD8+ T cell-mediated immune response plays an important role in inhibiting
progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For strategic immunotherapy, it is
critical to understand why some of the tumor cells escape from this immune attack.
In this study, we investigated how HCC cells alter endogenous anti-tumor immunity
and their related signaling pathways. We found that HCC cells, both in vitro and
in vivo, substantially secret and express amphiregulin (AR). AR in turn activates
immunosuppressive function of intratumoral CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs),
a major inhibitor of CD8+ T cells. Using either lentiviral siRNA, or AR neutralizing
antibody, we blocked the expression and function of AR to test the specificity of AR
mediated activation of Tregs, Biochemical and cell biology studies were followed
and confirmed that blocking of AR inhibited Tregs activation. In addition, we found
that AR can trigger the activation of rapamycin complex 1(mTORC1) signaling in
Tregs. The mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin treatment led to compromise Treg function
and resulted in enhancing anti-tumor function of CD8+ T cells. Blocking AR/EGFR
signaling in Tregs with Gefitinib also enhanced anti-tumor immunity and decreased
tumor size in a mouse xenograft tumor model. Taken together, our study suggested
a novel mechanism of functional interaction between HCC and Tregs for regulating
anti-tumor function of CD8+ T cells.

to inhibit the tumor growth of HCC. It is recognized
that IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells play an important
role in inhibiting and killing tumor cells and impeding
tumor growth. However, not all T cells are anti-tumor
effector immune cells. A subpopulation of CD4+ T cells
that express CD25 and the master transcriptional
factor Foxp3, termed regulatory T cells (Tregs), play

a crucial role in promoting tumor growth and progress
by inhibiting anti-tumor CD8+ T cells [3–5]. Although
previous observations have demonstrated the function
of Tregs in inhibiting anti-tumor CD8+ T cells in HCC
[6–9], the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms
concerning the activation of Tregs still remain largely
unknown. Most of the previous studies focused on
either how Tregs suppress tumor-associated antigen
(TAA) specific effector T cell function, or how Tregs
regulate tumor-associated inflammation. The cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation
of Tregs activity has been overlooked.
Recently, amphiregulin (AR) has been shown to
activate Tregs by binding to the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) on Tregs surface [10, 11]. Interestingly,
AR has been found to be present in a number of tumor
tissues including HCC [12–17], suggesting a potential
crosstalk between cancer cells and Tregs through
AR for regulating tumor immunity. In this study, we
investigated the role of AR produced by HCC cells and
its function on regulating Tregs. We found that AR was
over expressed in both cultured HCC cells and HCC
mouse xenografts. In addition, we found that intratumoral
Tregs expressed higher EGFR than their splenic
counterparts. The expression of CTLA-4 (cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) and ICOS (Inducible
T-cell COStimulator) in intratumoral Tregs was upregulated, and the Tregs-mediated suppression of CD8+
T cell function was enhanced in HCC. HCC-derived AR
promoted Tregs function partially through activation of
the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway.
Knockdown of AR expression in HCC cells or blockage
of EGFR signaling in Tregs enhanced CD8+ T cellmediated anti-tumor response. These data suggested
a novel mechanism by which anti-tumor immunity is
modulated in HCC.

and ELISA (Figure 1D, 1E). Our data indicated that HCC
cells overexpress AR both in vitro and in vivo.

Phenotype of intratumoral Tregs
To analyze the adaptive anti-HCC immunity, 2 × 107
splenic CD3+ T cells were isolated from C57BL/6J mice
and were adoptively transferred into HCC-inoculated mice
twice a week from day 7 to day 28 after inoculation. Then
T cells were isolated from the xenografts and spleens
and were analyzed for their phenotype. Splenic T cells
and intratumoral T cells contained similar proportions
of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs, CD4+CD25− conventional T cells
and CD4− T cells. However, as demonstrated by flow
cytometry analysis probing with EGFR antibody, the
EGFR expression was up-regulated only in intratumoral
Tregs, not in splenic Tregs (Figure 2A, 2B). In addition,
mRNA levels of IL-10, TGF-β, CTLA-4 and ICOS were
increased in intratumoral Tregs (Figure 2C), indicating
that intratumoral Tregs exhibited an activated phenotype.
This result implied that HCC might contribute to the
activation of Tregs.

HCC cells alter the Treg phenotype through AR
Since HCC cells over express AR, we hypothesized
that AR produced by HCC might be responsible for
intratumoral Tregs activation. To test this hypothesis,
we applied a non-contact co-culture system to culture
intratumoral Tregs with Hepa1–6 cells, and evaluated the
Treg signature gene expression by qRT-PCR. Hepa1–6
cells and Tregs were separated by the 0.4 μm pore
polycarbonate membrane inserts to avoid direct cell
contact. We found that the mRNA levels of CTLA-4 and
ICOS in Tregs increased after co-culture with Hepa1–6
cells, as compared with Tregs cultured alone (Figure 3A).
However, the expression of other gene including IL-10
and TGF-β was not significantly changed (Figure 3A),
suggesting IL-10 and TGF-β expression might not be
altered by Hepa1–6-derived soluble factors. To evaluate
the role of AR in Hepa1–6-mediated Tregs activation,
Hepa1–6 cells were transfected with lentivirus that carried
AR shRNA (LV-ARsh) or scramble shRNA (LV-scramble)
before co-culture with Tregs. In comparison with
non-transfected cells, Hepa1–6 cells transfected
with LV-ARsh showed low AR expression, while
LV-scramble transfected
Hepa1–6 cells and nontransfected cells expressed similar amount of AR
protein (Figure 3B). Expression of other EGF family
members such as EGF, TGF-α and epiregulin were not
influenced by transfection of lentivirus (Figure  3B),
suggesting the gene silencing was AR-specific.
Co-culture of Tregs with lentivirus-transfected Hepa1–6
cells revealed that AR gene knockdown abolished Hepa1–6
mediated up-regulation of CTLA-4 and ICOS expression in
Tregs (Figure 3C, 3D). To further confirm the effect of AR,
we co-cultured intratumoral Tregs with Hepa1–6 cells as

RESULTS
HCC cells overexpress AR
Previous studies have demonstrated that AR is
highly expressed in HCC and other tumor cells [16, 17,
21–23]. To confirm these observations, we assessed
expression of AR in multiple HCC cell lines. Consistent
with previous reports, all HCC cell lines including
Hepa1–6, Hepa-1c1c7, BpRc1 and c12 has higher AR
expression as compared to that in normal hepatocytes,
as demonstrated by Western blotting and real-time
PCR analysis (Figure 1A~1C). Among these cell lines,
Hepa1–6 has the highest AR expression. Based on
this result, we used Hepa1–6 to test the AR function in
regulating tumor immunity in the following experiments.
To evaluate AR expression in vivo, Hepa1–6 cells were
injected s.c. into Rag1−/− mice to establish a xenograft
tumor model. We found that AR expression in the
xenografts remains high as determined by Western blotting

above but using an AR neutralizing antibody to block the
function of AR. Consistently, the neutralizing antibody
significantly restrained the effect of AR, demonstrated by
lower expression of CTLA-4 and ICOS in comparison with
simply co-cultured Tregs or the isotype antibody group
(Figure 3E, 3F). Therefore, these results suggested that AR
was involved in HCC mediated phenotypic change of Tregs.

related to tumor-killing. As shown in Figure 4A, untreated
Tregs effectively inhibited expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α,
perforin and granzyme B. In the presence of AR, Tregs
further decreased expression of above molecules, whereas
the existence of AR neutralizing antibody diminished
the effect of AR. It was noted that the expression of
perforin and granzyme B were partially recovered by AR
neutralizing antibody, suggesting other factors might also
contribute to regulate Tregs activity. Since CD8+ T cells
did not express EGFR, it was unlikely that AR directly
inhibited CD8+ T cells. As the isotype control, polyclonal
goat IgG did not significantly alter the result, suggesting
the efficacy of the neutralizing antibody was AR-specific
(Figure 4A). To test the possibility that other EGF family
members such as EGF would induced similar changes
to Tregs, we performed similar co-culture experiments
using recombinant mouse EGF and neutralizing antiEGF antibody as treatment. To our surprise, as shown in

AR promotes Treg activity through mTORC1
signaling

activity to inhibit IFN-γ and TNF-α expression in CD8+
T cells, while it had no significant effect on perforin and
granzyme B expression. Thus, AR and EGF might trigger
non-uniform signaling in Tregs to modulate Treg function.
To evaluate the anti-tumor effect of CD8+ T cells,
+
CD8 T cells were sorted and added to Hepa1–6 cells for
co-culture. Apoptosis of Hepa1–6 cells were determined
24 h after addition of CD8+ T cells. As shown in
Figure  4B  and 4C, CD8+ T cells potently induced
hepa1–6 apoptosis and necrosis, whereas untreated
Tregs strongly inhibited hepa1–6 cell death induced
by CD8+ T cells. AR enhanced Tregs activity to further
inhibit hepa1–6 cell death, and AR neutralizing antibody
abolished the effect of AR. Therefore, AR mediated
activation of Tregs contributed to the suppression of
anti-tumor immunity.

Previous studies showed that AR activates EGFR
and mTORC1 signaling in different cell types [24–26].
More importantly, mTORC1 enhances Tregs function
by controlling ICOS and CTLA-4 expression [27, 28].
However, to our knowledge, whether AR activates
mTORC1 in Tregs has not been reported. Thus, we
investigated mTORC1 and other signaling pathways
downstream of AR using intratumoral Tregs treated
with AR or hepa1–6-conditioned medium. We found
that the level of phosphorylated mTOR, STAT3, JNK
and Erk1/2 were elevated in Tregs treated with AR or
hepa1–6-conditioned medium, compared with that in
untreated Tregs (Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure 2).
Furthermore, rapamycin, which preferentially blocks
mTORC1 pathway, abolished mTOR phosphorylation
induced by conditioned medium. Meanwhile, conditioned
medium from LV-ARsh hepa1–6 cell culture failed
to induce mTOR phosphorylation (Figure 6B). Thus,
mTORC1 signaling was activated by AR in hepa1–
6-conditioned medium. To determine the role of
AR-induced mTORC1 activation in regulating anti-tumor
immunity, Tregs were treated with rapamycin and/or AR
before co-culture with intratumoral CD8+ T cells. As
shown in Figure 6C, rapamycin diminished the effect of
AR, demonstrated by high expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α,
perforin and granzyme B in comparison with AR-treated
Tregs. Consistently, compared with AR-treated Tregs,
rapamycin-treated Tregs were less capable of suppressing
CD8+ T cells, and resulted in increased tumor cell death
(Figure 6D).

AR suppresses the anti-tumor activity of CD8+
T cells in vivo
To test whether the above observations could
be repeated in vivo, we established mouse xenograft
tumor models using Hepa1–6 cells transfected with
LV-ARsh or LV-scramble. These cells were
inoculated into Rag1−/− mice. Four weeks after
inoculation, intratumoral T cells in the xenografts
were isolated and analyzed. Consistent with
the role of AR in tumor growth, the size of
LV-ARs xenografts were smaller (about 70%) than
that of the size of LV-scramble xenografts or nontransfected xenografts (data not shown). However, the
proportions of Tregs, CD4+ conventional T cells and
CD4− T cells were comparable among each group,
suggesting AR knockdown did not alter the recruitment
of each T cell subset into the tumor (Figure 5A). The
expression of CTLA-4 and ICOS was decreased on
Tregs in LV-ARsh xenografts, in comparison with
their counterparts in non-transfected or LV-scramble
xenografts (Figure 5B). The expression of CTLA-4
and ICOS on Tregs in non-transfected xenografts and
LV-scramble transfected xenografts was comparable,
suggesting transfection of lentivirus did not impact
the phenotype of Treg (Figure 5B). AR knockdown in
LV-ARsh xenografts was confirmed by Western blotting
(Figure 5C). The Tregs proliferation in xenografts was
quantitated by ki67 staining and no significant difference
was seen among three groups, suggesting AR did not
involve in modulating intratumoral Tregs proliferation
(Figure 5D). In LV-ARsh xenografts, CD8+ T cells have
higher expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α and perforin than
those in non-transfected xenografts and LV-scramble
xenografts, suggesting AR knockdown promoted antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells (Figure 5E). However, the
expression of granzyme B was not changed, suggesting
some factors might compensate for AR in the regulation
of granzyme B in vivo (Figure 5E).

Blocking EGFR signaling in Tregs enhances antitumor immunity
To investigate the relationship between AR and
EGFR signaling in Tregs, we used Gefitinib, a selective
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to block the EGFR
signaling. Gefitinib (100 ng/ml) was used to treat T cells
for 24 h before T cells were transferred into Hepa1–
6-inoculated Rag1−/− mice. As shown in Figure 7A,
analysis of the xenograft tumor size revealed that mice
receiving vehicle-treated T cells had significantly smaller
tumors than non-transferred mice. Transfer of Gefitinibtreated T cells further reduced tumor size, suggesting that
Gefitinib enhanced anti-tumor immunity. The proportion
of intratumoral Tregs in total intratumoral T cells was
not changed in mice receiving Gefitinib-treated T cells,
suggesting Treg recruitment was not altered (Figure 7B).
CTLA-4 and ICOS expression were low on intratumoral
Tregs of mice receiving Gefitinib-treated T cells
(Figure 7B). Meanwhile, compared with mice receiving
vehicle-treated T  cells, CD8+ T cells expressed high
IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin and granzyme B in mice receiving

inhibit tumor growth through production of cytotoxic
mediators. However, TAA-specific CD8+ T-cell response
to HCC seems to be limited. It is believed that different
mechanisms contribute to the failure of the cellular
immune response [29]. CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs were
considered as a crucial factor that suppress the anti-tumor
function of Effector CD8+ T cells [7, 9, 30, 31]. However,
how Treg activity is modulated in the tumor sites remains
largely unexplored.
In this study we found that HCC cells suppress
CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity through
enhancing Treg activity. Our important finding is the
role of AR in HCC cells-mediated immunomodulation.
AR is synthesized as a transmembrane protein, and its

extracellular domain is proteolytically processed to release
the mature protein [32]. As an EGF family member, AR
was shown to regulate growth of distinct cell types [12].
AR-producing cells include mast cells [33], basophils
[34], dendritic cells [35], innate lymphoid cells [36],
keratinocytes [37] and activated TH2 cells [38]. More
importantly, AR is increasingly recognized as a potent
oncogenic factor that overexpressed in different types
of human cancers, specifically, downregulation of AR
expression or blocking its function, have shown promising
pre-clinical results, suggesting that these strategies could
enhance the effectiveness of conventional antitumoral
approaches [16, 39–42]. In HCC cells, AR has been
intensely studied, overexpression of AR enhanced the
proliferation rate, anchorage-independent growth, drug
resistance, and in vivo tumorigenic potential of HCC
cells, which emphasize the importance of AR in HCC
development and treatment [43–47]. However, little is
known about what factors drive the expression of AR in
HCC cells. Our current study focused on dissecting the
signaling pathway(s) related to AR expression.
Since CD8+ T cells are critical for inhibiting tumor
growth, we first studied the role of HCC-derived AR
in regulation of CD8+ T cells. Our result indicated that
intratumoral CD8+ T cells do not express EGFR similar
to their splenic counterparts [11]. Therefore, it is unlikely
that AR directly regulates CD8+ T cells. A recent study
indicates that AR plays an important role in regulating
Treg cell function [10]. In liver diseases, Tregs protect
livers from overwhelming damage, but also contribute to
the compromise and even failure of CD8+ T cell response
to infection and carcinoma [30, 48, 49]. We speculated that
HCC cells express AR to modulate Treg cell activity and
subsequently restrain anti-tumor immunity. As expected,
we found that intratumoral Tregs up-regulated EGFR
expression on their cell surface. More importantly, we
found that HCC-derived AR enhanced Treg activity and
in turn suppressed anti-tumor activity of intratumoral
CD8+ T cells. Addition of AR neutralizing antibody, or
down-regulating AR expression in HCC cells, diminished
the enhancement of Tregs activity by HCC cells. To our
knowledge, we are the first to report the role of AR in
modulating immunity in HCC. AR plays a crucial role
in establishing interactions among HCC cells, Tregs
and effector CD8+ T cells. However, what caused the
up-regulation of EGFR expression in intratumoral Tregs
is still a puzzle. EGFR receptors include AR, EGF,
TGF-α, epiregulin, heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF)
and Hepatocarcinoma cell-derived hepatoma-derived
growth factor (HDGF), have been confirmed to mediate
tumorigenesis and promote tumor progression [50, 51].
Since splenic Tregs have low EGFR, it is likely that
intratumoral milieu induced high EGFR expression in
infiltrating Tregs. Whether the high EGFR expression is
caused by these soluble factors or direct cell contact is an
unanswered question and needs further study.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

As an EGF family member, AR is supposed to
bind to EGFR and induce intracellular signaling in target
cells. One of the EGFR downstream signaling cascade
is the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which regulates cell
growth, differentiation, senescence and metabolism
[52]. The role of mTOR in regulating immune response
has been a research interest for the past decade. Recent
research indicated that mTORC1 regulates Treg cell
homeostasis and function [27, 28, 53]. We therefore
speculated that AR triggers mTORC1 signaling in Tregs
to modulate Tregs function. Our results confirmed
this speculation. Both AR and HCC cell-conditioned
medium induced activation of phosphorylated mTOR.
Furthermore,  inhibition of mTOR activation by
rapamycin blocked AR-induced enhancement of Treg
cell activity. We suggested that AR promotes Treg
cell function through activation of mTORC1 signaling
in Tregs. It was noted that other molecules in EGFR
signaling pathways such as STAT3, JNK and Erk were
also activated in AR-treated Tregs. Whether these
molecules are involved in modulating intratumoral Treg
activity remains unclear. It could be one of our future
plans to dissect how these molecules influence Tregs.
Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo studies
demonstrated that HCC cells over express AR and
promote Treg cell activity, leading to suppress CD8+
T cell-mediated anti-tumor response. Although it is
not clear whether the interactions among HCC cells,
Tregs and CD8+ T cells present in human HCC patients,
our study sheds some light in immunomodulation
and provides a rational for designing immunotherapy
for HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouse HCC xenograft model and adoptive
transfer of T cells
All animal experiments were conducted in
compliance with institutional guidelines and Wuhan
University Guidelines for the Use of Animals. All
animal procedures were approved by Wuhan University
School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee.
Six-to-eight week old wild type C57BL/6J and Rag1−/−
male mice were purchased from Nanjing Biomedical
Research Institute of Nanjing University (Nanjing,
China). Rag1−/− mice were subcutaneously (s.c.)
inoculated with 1 × 106 Hepa1–6 cells at the left flank.
At 28 days after inoculation, the mice were sacrificed
by inhalation of carbon dioxide for an average of 5 min.
Tumor volume was measured according to the standard
formula 1/2 × L × W2. In some experiments, 2 × 107
splenic CD3+ T cells were sorted from C57BL/6J mice
by flow cytometry and were i.v. injected into Hepa1–
6-inoculated mice twice a week from day 7 to day 28 after
inoculation.

Isolating intratumoral T cells

Four days after stimulation, cells were stained with
PE-Cy7 anti-CD8a antibody and CD8+ T cells were
sorted by flow cytometry. Cytokine production in CD8+
T cells was measured by qRT-PCR. In some experiments,
Tregs were treated with 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse
AR protein (R&D systems), 10 μg/ml AR neutralizing
antibody (R&D systems), 10 μg/ml polyclonal goat
IgG (R&D systems) or 100 ng/ml rapamycin (EMD
Millipore).
To determine the anti-tumor activity of CD8+
T cells, intratumoral CD8+ T cells were co-cultured with
Hepa1–6 cells for 24 h. The ratio between CD8+ T cells
and Hepa1–6 cells was 2:1. Cells were then dissociated
with 10 mM EDTA-PBS at room temperature for 10 min
before staining with 2 μg/ml Propidium iodide (PI), FITC
Annexin V and PE-Cy7 anti-CD8a (53–6.7) (All from BD
Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Cell death of CD8a− tumor cells was analyzed by flow
cytometry within 1 h. Cell death can be divided into early
apoptotsis (Annexin V+PI−), Late apoptotsis (Annexin
V+PI+), and necrosis (Annexin V−PI+).

Tumor-infiltrating immune cells were isolated as
previously described with some modifications [18, 19].
Briefly, fresh tumor tissues were cut into small pieces
and digested at 37°C for at least 20 min in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 0.05% collagenase Type IV (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO), 0.002% DNase I (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) and 20% fetal calf serum (FCS, HyClone
Laboratories, Logan, UT). Dissociated cells were then
filtered through a 150-μm mesh and mononuclear cells
were obtained by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation.
Mononuclear cells were collected from the interface,
washed in PBS, and resuspended in Tris-NH4Cl solution
to lyse residual red blood cells. Cells were washed with
PBS twice and were subjected to further processing.
Intratumoral CD4+CD25+ T cells (Treg-enriched cells)
were enriched from intratumoral mononuclear cells using
the EasySep™ Mouse CD25 Regulatory T Cell Positive
Selection Kit (Stemcell Technologies) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Foxp3 staining was conducted
to confirm that more than 80% enriched cells were
Foxp3+ cells. Intratumoral CD8+ T cells were selected
using EasySep™ Mouse CD8+ T Cell Enrichment Kit
(Stemcell Technology). Before further experiments, Tregenriched cells and CD8+ T cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 containing 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.

Flow cytometry analysis
The following anti-mouse antibodies were used
for detection and enrichment of immune cells: APC antiCD3 (17A2), PE anti-TCRβ (H57–597), APC-Cy7 antiCD4 (GK1.5), Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-Foxp3 (R16–715),
and PE-Cy7 anti-CD8a (53–6.7) (BD Pharmingen); PE
anti-CTLA-4 (UC10–4B9) and PE anti-ICOS (7E.17G9)
(eBioscience). PE anti-Ki67 (Biolegend), Anti-EGFR
antibody (ab30) (Abcam). For cell surface staining, cells
were incubated with corresponding antibodies in PBS for
15 min on ice before analysis on a FACSAria™ III cell
sorter (FACSDiva software, BD). Dead cells that stained by
propidium iodide (2 μg/ml) were excluded. For intracellular
cytokine staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with
BD Cytofix/perm and Perm/wash buffer according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Then cells were stained at room
temperature for 30 min with Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-IFN-γ
(XMG1.2, Biolegend), Alexa Fluor® 647 anti-TNF-α (MP6XT22, Biolegend), APC anti-perforin (eBioOMAK-D,
eBioscience) and PE anti-granzyme B (NGZB, eBioscience)
respectively before analysis on a BD LSRII flow cytometer.
For Foxp3 staining, Foxp3 fix/perm buffer (Biolegend)
set was used according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
All flow cytometry data was analyzed with Flowjo 7.6.1
software. Cell sorting was performed on a FACSAria™ III
cell sorter (FACSDiva software, BD) based on cell surface
marker staining.

In vitro cell culture
Murine HCC cell lines Hepa1–6, Hepa-1c1c7,
BpRC2 and c12 were cultured in 10-cm culture dishes
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillinstreptomycin, 1% HEPES, and 0.05 mM 2-ME
(2-Mercapto-Ethanol) in an incubator at 37°C.
The culture of mouse primary hepatocytes was
conducted following the established protocol with a few
modifications [20]. Briefly, hepatocytes were isolated from
livers of C57BL/6 mice by 0.1% collagenase IV (SigmaAldrich) digestion. The dissociated cells were then plated
in collagen-coated 24-well or 6-well culture dishes with
supplemented DMEM as described above. After culture
for 4 h, the medium was replaced by fresh culture medium.
For Tregs and Hepa1–6 cells co-culture, Corning
HTS Transwell 24-well plate was used (0.4 μm pore;
Corning Costar). 5 × 105 Hepa1–6 cells were seeded
into the lower chamber and 1 × 105 tumor-infiltrating
Tregs were added in the upper chamber. After 24 h
incubation, Tregs in the upper chamber were collected
and subject to RNA extraction or flow cytometry. To
detect the immunosuppressive effect of Tregs on CD8+
T cells, a 48-well plate was pre-coated with 5 μg/ml
anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (17A2, eBiscience).
1 × 106 intratumoral CD8+ T cells and 2 × 105 intratumoral
Tregs were seeded into pre-coated wells in the presence
of 2 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody (37.51, eBioscience).

Signaling Technology). Membranes were developed
with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Thermo Scientific) and the optical density was analyzed
using a UVP Bioimaging system (UVP, Upland, CA).

Knockdown of AR expression by lentivirus
transfection
Lentiviral particles containing mouse Amphiregulin
shRNA or scramble shRNA were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Transfection of Hepa1–6 cells with
lentivirus was conducted following the manufacturer’s
instruction. Briefly, Hepa1–6 cells were plated into
24-well plate 24 h before transfection or until cells reached
50% confluent. On the day of transfection, the medium was
replaced by fresh medium containing 5 μg/ml polybrene.
Lentiviral particles were added into cell culture at the
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and were incubated
with cells overnight. Then the virus-containing medium
was replaced by polybrene-free fresh medium and cells
were incubated for another 36–48 h to allow for expression
of puromycin-resistant gene. To select stable clones
expressing shRNA, 2 μg/ml puromycin was added into
cell culture and was refreshed every 3 days until resistant
clones were identified. Resistant clones were expanded and
AR expression was analyzed by Western blotting.

Statistics
The data were analyzed by Prism 5.0 software
(GraphPad). Quantitative data were expressed as mean ±
SEM from the indicated number of experiments. Student’s
t test or one-way ANOVA were used for comparison of
mean between the groups. P values < 0.05 were considered
significant.

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Fifty milligrams of normal mouse liver or
Hepa1–6 xenograft tissues were cut into small pieces
and homogenized manually in a homogenizer containing
0.25 ml of homogenization buffer (PBS containing 0.05%
sodium azide, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor
cocktail purchased from Roche, pH 7.2, 4°C) and then
sonicated on ice for 10 minutes. Homogenates were
centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 minutes and supernatant
was collected for ELISA. Cell culture supernatants were
collected and stored at −80°C until used. AR concentration
was determined by Mouse Amphiregulin DuoSet
(R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The plates were read on a SpectraMax® i3x microplate
reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
