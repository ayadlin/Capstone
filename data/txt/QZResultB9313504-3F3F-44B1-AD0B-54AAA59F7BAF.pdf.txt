BACKGROUND: We investigated the risk of central nervous system (CNS) failure after clinical benefit with epidermal
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in Korean patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the pattern of disease progression of 287 advanced NSCLC
patients who were treated with gefitinib or erlotinib. Patients whose best tumor response was complete response,
partial response, or stable disease (90 days) were classified into the group receiving clinical benefit with these
drugs. RESULTS: The clinical benefit group had a higher incidence of CNS failure as an initial progression, compared
with the non-clinical benefit group (26% vs 4%; P < .001). Isolated CNS failure was also more frequent in the clinical
benefit group than in the non-clinical benefit group (13% vs 1%; P < .001). In a multivariate analysis, clinical benefit
with EGFR-TKIs significantly increased the risk of isolated CNS failure, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 10.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-29.1, P ¼ .01). In patients with isolated CNS failure, the median time from initial intracranial
failure to extracranial failure was 9.9 months (95% CI, 1.9-21.9 months) and to death was 12.9 months (95% CI, 3.322.5 months). CONCLUSIONS: The CNS was frequently the initial failure site after clinical benefit with EGFR-TKIs in
Korean NSCLC patients. Patients with isolated CNS failure showed durable extracranial control after cranial progression. A role for close surveillance of the CNS during EGFR-TKI treatment or prophylactic measures appears worthy of

In recent years, many targeted agents have been developed to improve the typically dismal outcome associated with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, a small molecule drug inhibiting the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the first targeted agent to be successfully used in practice in advanced NSCLC. In
several prospective studies, these EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) showed modest tumor shrinkage rates of
9%-26%.1-3 However, in a phase 3 trial with previously treated advanced NSCLC, EGFR-TKIs provided a survival benefit over best supportive care, with a hazard ratio of 0.70.4 In addition, several highly predictive clinical or biological factors
for response to EGFR-TKIs have been identified; these include female gender, never smoking, East Asian descent, adenocarcinoma histologic type, and EGFR mutations.5-7 However, patterns of progression or long-term outcomes after an initial response to EGFR-TKIs have not yet been fully investigated.
Central nervous system (CNS) metastasis is a prevalent and serious complication, with negative effects on quality of
life and overall survival.8-10 In particular, it has been known to develop more frequently in patients with younger age,
female gender, adenocarcinoma histology, or late-stage presentation.11-14 Recently, there has been a refocus on CNS

metastasis as peripheral tumor control further improved.
For example, CNS relapse is a major problem in managing locally advanced NSCLC, in which aggressive trimodal treatment has enhanced primary tumor control and
improved overall survival.15,16 In addition, frequent CNS
metastases have been anecdotally reported in advanced
NSCLC patients showing durable responses to targeted
therapy such as EGFR-TKIs. Omuro et al reported that
the incidence of the CNS as an initial failure site reached
33% in EGFR-TKI responders with advanced NSCLC.17
A similar phenomenon has been previously observed in
other types of tumor, such as human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing metastatic breast
cancer (MBC) achieving prolonged survival with trastuzumab-based treatment.18,19
A high incidence of CNS progression after a
response to EGFR-TKIs may be more important in an
Asian NSCLC population, because EGFR-TKI therapy
has been shown to be more effective in this ethnic
group.1,2 However, there are no published data on the
incidence of CNS progression after a response to EGFRTKIs in Asian patients. Thus, we evaluated the pattern of
disease progression in Korean NSCLC patients who used
EGFR-TKIs, focusing on the incidence, characteristics,
and risk factors for CNS metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We reviewed 342 patients who were diagnosed with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic NSCLC and
who were subsequently treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib at Yonsei University College of Medicine (Seoul,
Korea) between January 2002 and January 2008. We
excluded patients who had stopped drug treatment within 1
month, for any reason. Patients with CNS metastasis were
included if they had received local treatment, such as wholebrain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery, or other surgery,
and their CNS status was thereafter clinically and radiologically stable before EGFR-TKI treatment. As a result, 287 eligible patients were enrolled in the final cohort.

review board waived informed consent requirements.

by computed tomography (CT) every 8 weeks, in accordance with the guidelines established by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) committee.20
To evaluate neurological symptoms and to detect any
change in pre-existing CNS disease, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or CT was performed. On detection
of CNS progression, extracranial sites were also fully
re-evaluated.
Biomarker Analysis
Nucleotide sequencing of the EGFR kinase domain
(exons 18-21) was performed using nested polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplification of individual exons.
Details of the sequencing procedure have been described
elsewhere.21 Mutations in K-RAS codons 12 and 13 were
identified as previously described.22
Statistical Analysis
CNS metastasis includes all cases of parenchymal metastasis and cytologically or radiologically proven leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. CNS failure means both newly
developed metastasis and progression of pre-existing
lesions. Patients whose best tumor responses were complete response, partial response (PR), or stable disease
(SD) for more than 90 days were classified into the group
that received clinical benefit with EGFR-TKIs.
Time from diagnosis to progression was measured
from the diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic disease until
progression occurred after EGFR-TKI therapy. Time to
progression (TTP) or overall survival (OS) was defined as
the period from the initiation date of EGFR-TKI therapy
to the date of progression or death, respectively. Survival
time was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the
survival difference between groups was assessed by the
log-rank test. Fisher exact test was used to compare the
frequency of CNS failure according to the risk factors. To
calculate the actuarial incidence of CNS failure by the
Kaplan-Meier method, patients were censored after recurrence at other sites or after death from other causes. To
assess the strength of interaction between risk factors and
CNS failure, logistic regression analysis was used. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with the level of significance set
at 0.05.

patients, the median TTP and OS were 3.9 months (95%
CI, 3.2-4.6 months) and 13.6 months (95% CI, 11.415.7 months), respectively. The best tumor responses
included PR (n ¼ 82, 29%), South Dakota 90 days (n
¼ 81, 28%), South Dakota <90 days (n ¼ 9, 3%), and
progressive disease (PD; n ¼ 115, 40%). The clinical benefit group (n ¼ 163, 57%) was significantly associated
with longer TTP (8.5 vs 1.7 months; P < .001), longer
time from diagnosis to progression (19.4 vs 10.6 months;
P < .001), and longer OS (24.5 vs 4.3 months; P < .001)
than the non-clinical benefit group.
Pattern of Failure
In the analysis of the 232 evaluable patients, the site of
first failure was lung in 146 (63%) patients, CNS in 37
(16%), and other sites in 49 (21%; Table 2). The clinical
benefit group had a higher incidence of CNS failure as the
first failure site, compared with the non-clinical benefit
group (26% vs 4%; P < .001). Moreover, isolated CNS
failure, without other systemic progression, was more frequent in the clinical benefit group than in the non-clinical
benefit group (13% vs 1%; P < .001). In an analysis limited to newly developed CNS metastasis, the difference in
the rate of isolated CNS failure between the 2 groups
remained significant (11% vs 1%; P ¼ .02). In the clinical
benefit group, the actuarial 1-year and 2-year rates for isolated CNS failure were 14 and 37%, respectively (Fig. 1).
Risk Factors for Isolated CNS Failure
In the univariate analysis, never smokers, patients with adenocarcinoma, the clinical benefit group, and those with a
longer time from diagnosis to progression had significantly higher risk for isolated CNS failure (Table 3).
However, in the multivariate analysis, only clinical benefit
from EGFR-TKIs was an independent predictor of iso-

lated CNS failure, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of
10.9 (95% CI, 1.4-29.1, P ¼ .01).
In a subset analysis, a strong association between
clinical benefit from EGFR-TKIs and isolated CNS failure was still observed for never smokers (adjusted HR of
the clinical benefit vs non-clinical benefit group, 10.7;
95% CI, 1.3-26.7; P ¼ .02) and for patients with adenocarcinoma (adjusted HR, 11.6; 95% CI, 1.4-21.6; P ¼
.02), but not for patients with a median time from diagnosis to progression of more than 12 months (adjusted
HR, 4.27; 95% CI, 0.5-34.9; P ¼ .17).

Characteristics of Isolated CNS Failure
The characteristics of 17 patients experiencing isolated
CNS failure after treatment with EGFR-TKIs are presented in Table 4. Of the 4 patients with pre-existing
CNS metastasis, 2 patients with single brain metastasis
had been managed with radiosurgery alone, and 2 patients
with several brain metastases had been treated with
WBRT. Most of the patients with isolated CNS failure
had clinical benefit from EGFR-TKIs (n ¼ 16; 94%). After EGFR-TKI failure, 12 (71%) patients subsequently
received chemotherapy, including 10 (59%) patients who
continued on EGFR-TKIs and 2 (12%) patients who
were treated with pemetrexed (Alimta). The median time
from initial intracranial failure to extracranial failure was
9.9 months (95% CI, 1.9-21.9 months). Patients with
isolated CNS failure had a longer median time from initial failure to death, compared with those with other site
failures (12.9 months; 95% CI, 3.3-22.5 months) versus
6.0 months (95% CI, 4.5-7.5 months; P ¼ .01; Fig. 2).

Subsequent Systemic Therapy After Isolated
CNS Failure
Ten patients continued EGFR-TKIs after CNS failure.
The median age of these patients was 54 years (range, 3571 years); all were female and never smokers, and 9 of
them had adenocarcinoma-type histology. EGFR gene
mutation analysis was conducted in 6 of the 10 patients; 3
(50%) harbored activating mutations in the EGFR gene.
Best tumor responses to the first EGFR-TKIs were PR in
3 patients and SD in 7. The median first TTP was 10.9
months (95% CI, 8.9-26.5 months), and the median second TTP was 10.0 months (95% CI, 1.9-20.4 months).
The median time from initial failure to death was 14.0

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first report on the incidence
of CNS failure after EGFR-TKI therapy in an Asian
NSCLC cohort. A comprehensive analysis of 287 patients
revealed that 26% of the patients with clinical benefit
from EGFR-TKIs experienced CNS failure as the first

progression. This rate is consistent with a previous report
by Omuro et al17 Multivariate analysis confirmed that a
clinically beneficial response to the drugs was an independent risk factor for isolated CNS failure. Moreover,
when the analysis was limited to patients with adenocarcinoma, a well-known risk factor for CNS metastasis in
NSCLC,13 the relationship between clinical benefit from
EGFR-TKIs and isolated CNS failure remained significant. Nevertheless, the present study has intrinsic weaknesses as a retrospective study. In particular, the incidence
of CNS metastasis might have been underestimated,
because complete restaging was not performed at disease
progression in some patients. Thus, a prospective study
with restaging will be needed to validate the frequent
CNS failure in a group receiving clinical benefit with
EGFR-TKIs.
The mechanism underlying the relationship
between clinical benefit from EGFR-TKIs and CNS metastasis remains to be determined. Several causal factors
may be involved. First, prolonged survival through the use
of EGFR-TKIs may coincide with a substantial risk for
developing CNS metastasis, as the cranial event occurs in
a relatively late phase of the disease. The group with clinical benefit from EGFR-TKIs survived significantly longer
from the initial diagnosis to the first failure after EGFRTKI therapy. In the analysis of subjects with a median
time from diagnosis to progression of more than 12
months, no difference was observed in the rate of isolated
CNS failure between the groups with and without a clinical benefit from EGFR-TKIs. However, because the multivariate test eventually confirmed that a clinically
beneficial response to the drugs, but not prolonged survival, was a risk factor for isolated CNS failure, prolonged
survival alone cannot explain the prevalence of CNS metastasis. Second, tumors that are sensitive to EGFR-TKIs
may have a high intrinsic potential for CNS metastasis.
Somatic EGFR mutations are the most dominant predictor of a clinical response to EGFR-TKIs.5-7 In a recent
report, Matsumoto et al proposed that the high frequency
of EGFR mutations in brain metastases of lung adenocarcinoma suggests an intrinsic brain tropism of these
tumors.23 The present study confirmed that tumors harboring EGFR mutations tended to be associated with a
greater risk for isolated CNS failure, compared with
tumors having wild-type EGFR. On the other hand,
Huang et al reported that the overexpression of STAT3,
an important mediator of the oncogenic effects of EGFR
mutations,24 was strongly associated with brain metastasis
in human melanoma cells.25 Further studies are required

Cancer

to determine whether EGFR mutations endow tumor cells
with metastatic propensity to the CNS. Third, incomplete
drug penetration of the brain-blood barrier may account
for the increased incidence of CNS metastasis. Those
patients showing isolated CNS failure developed CNS recurrence or progression despite apparently excellent
extracranial control. These results may indicate that drug
delivery to the CNS was hindered, thus permitting CNS
failure. In a preclinical study in nontumor-bearing rats,
radiolabeled (14C)-gefitinib showed very limited distribution in the CNS.26 In a case report of NSCLC with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis treated with gefitinib, Jackman
et al showed that cerebrospinal fluid drug levels were
below the level required for tumor growth inhibition,
even at a gefitinib dose of 500 mg/d.27 However, because
a number of clinical studies have reported the successful
treatment of CNS metastasis with standard or high doses
of EGFR-TKIs,28-30 we cannot presently reach any conclusion regarding the impermeability of the brain-blood
barrier to EGFR-TKIs. Additional studies to collect pharmacokinetic data for small, targeted molecules or to determine predictors for the brain-blood barrier breakdown
would be useful. Fourth, metastatic CNS clones may possess an inherited resistance to EGFR-TKIs, or they may
acquire earlier drug resistance during EGFR-TKI therapy.
For example, a small study analyzing the second EGFR
mutation in patients who showed progression after
EGFR-TKI therapy revealed that the type and nature of
acquired resistance in EGFR mutants may differ between
the CNS and the periphery.31 Thus, both intrinsic characteristics of metastatic cells and the unique microenvironment of the CNS may contribute to differing patterns of
resistance.
Understanding these mechanisms may aid in determining treatment strategies beyond progression in
patients with isolated CNS failure. However, the current
data are insufficient to answer the question as to whether
we should continue EGFR–TKI treatment even after progression in this population. In several retrospective studies
in HER2þ MBC, the continuation of trastuzumab
beyond brain metastasis prolonged post-PD survival,
owing to a sustained antitumor activity at extracranial
and/or intracranial sites.32-34 In addition, there is increasing interest in the benefit of a second EGFR-TKI after
failure of a first EGFR-TKI in advanced NSCLC, regardless of the failure site.35,36 We previously reported that
erlotinib, as a salvage treatment, achieved a 28.6% disease
control rate and a 9.5% response rate in patients who
failed with gefitinib.37 Thus, a randomized study to

1341

Original Article

extend EGFR pathway blockade after first progression is
warranted in patients harboring a potential to maintain
the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs with acceptable toxicity.
In the present study, the majority of patients who
experienced isolated CNS failure showed durable extracranial control even after cranial progression. These results
suggest that prophylactic measures or early detection and
radical treatment of CNS metastasis may help to prolong
the response duration of EGFR-TKIs and to reduce cranial complications in selected populations. In locally
advanced NSCLC, with a 15%-30% CNS relapse
risk,14,15 several studies have already reported that prophylactic cranial irradiation significantly reduced the
CNS relapse rate, by 5%-10%,38-41 and a prospective
study to examine the survival benefit of prophylactic cranial irradiation is currently underway. On the basis of
these results, we have proposed a randomized phase 3 trial
addressing the efficacy and toxicity of prophylactic cranial
irradiation in patients with advanced NSCLC who are
nonprogressive on gefitinib or erlotinib.
In conclusion, this study shows that the CNS is a
frequent site of initial failure in Korean patients with
advanced NSCLC who had a clinically beneficial response
to EGFR-TKI therapy. Additional large, prospective
studies to determine an accurate rate of CNS metastasis
and preclinical studies on drug resistance mechanisms are
required to better understand this phenomenon.
