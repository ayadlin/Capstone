Abstract
Disseminated high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa)
is an aggressive disease treated with platinum and taxane
combination therapy. While initial response can be favorable,
the disease typically relapses and becomes resistant to treatment. As genomic alterations in HGS-OvCa are heterogeneous,
identiﬁcation of clinically meaningful molecular markers for
outcome prediction is challenging. We developed a novel
computational approach (PSFinder) that fuses transcriptomics
and clinical data to identify HGS-OvCa prognostic subgroups
for targeted treatment. Application of PSFinder to transcriptomics data from 180 HGS-OvCa patients treated with platinum–taxane therapy revealed 61 transcript isoforms that characterize two poor and one good survival-associated groups

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cause of
female cancer deaths worldwide. The 5-year survival rate for highgrade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa), the most common
ovarian cancer sub-type, is only 35% to 40% (1). The standard
treatment for HGS-OvCa is surgery and platinum–taxane combination therapy, and while most patients with HGS-OvCa at the
advanced stage of the disease initially respond to it, and some
patients experience extended and repetitive responses, the treatment is very seldom curative and the majority suffers relapse
within 18 months (2). This is mostly due to the fact that despite
being a single morphologic and clinical entity, genomic altera-

(P ¼ 0.007). These groups were validated in eight independent
data sets, including a prospectively collected ovarian cancer
cohort. Two poor prognostic groups have distinct expression
proﬁles and are characteristic by increased hypermethylation
and stroma-related genes. Integration of the PSFinder signature
and BRCA1/2 mutation status allowed even better stratiﬁcation
of HGS-OvCa patients' prognosis. The herein introduced novel
and generally applicable computational approach can identify
outcome-related subgroups and facilitate the development
of precision medicine to overcome drug resistance. A limited
set of biomarkers divides HGS-OvCa into three prognostic
groups and predicts patients in need of targeted therapies.

tions in HGS-OvCa are complex (1, 3), and there are no known
targetable mutations that could serve as uniform therapeutic
targets. Accordingly, HGS-OvCa cannot yet be managed optimally, often leading to adverse side effects and health costs without
reasonable beneﬁt.
Little is known on factors that predict outcome of HGS-OvCa
platinum–taxane therapy at treatment-na€ve stage. Currently, the
best biomarkers to predict chemotherapy response and improved
5-year survival odds are germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2,
detected in 15% to 22% of patients with HGS-OvCa (4). Furthermore, several proteins, such as STAT3 (5) and MUC16 (6),
and pathways, such as PI3K–AKT and VEGF (3), have also been
suggested to contribute to platinum resistance in ovarian cancer.
Still, there are very few clinically relevant treatment options for
platinum-resistant patients with ovarian cancer available at the
moment. Thus, biomarkers that are able to predict the response
for platinum–taxane therapy at treatment-na€ve stage are urgently
needed.
Establishing reliable prognostic or predictive biomarkers
requires identiﬁcation of a coherent subset of patients that
share common clinical and molecular characteristics, such as
short survival and activation of a certain pathway. A major issue
in identifying such subsets is that molecular data from tumors
with identical anatomical location, stage, and grade can be very
heterogeneous. Thus, reliable biomarker identiﬁcation and
validation require molecular data from large cohorts of treatment-na€ve tumors. A major bottleneck in translating largescale molecular data into robust biomarkers is the paucity of
cost-efﬁcient and robust computational methods (7). Many
existing approaches to identify biomarkers use a two-step

approach where computational methods, such as unsupervised
learning (8, 9), Bayesian methods (10), or dimension reduction
(11, 12), are used to identify clusters of patients that share
clinical or molecular characteristics. This is followed by assessment of biologic or medical relevance for the identiﬁed clusters
using Gene Ontology, pathway, or clinical data. Such
approaches often result in clusters of patients that are formed
without association to a clinical endpoint. Furthermore, several
studies have identiﬁed clusters of gene or protein markers
associated with prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer
(13–15), but these clusters may contain hundreds of loosely
correlated genes or proteins, which makes the choice of putative biomarkers challenging.
Here, we introduce a novel computational approach called
Prognostic Subgroup Finder (PSFinder) to stratify patients into
prognostic groups by coexpressed isoform- and gene-level
markers identiﬁed from the large-scale transcriptomics and
clinical data. The major novel aspect in the PSFinder approach
is that the identiﬁed groups of patients stratiﬁed by coexpressed
markers are directly associated with a clinical endpoint, which
facilitates interpretation of the groups as well as planning
subsequent experiments. We applied PSFinder to patients
with HGS-OvCa treated with the standard platinum–taxane
combination therapy from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
HGS-OvCa cohort and identiﬁed three prognostic groups with
distinct expression proﬁles stratiﬁed by 61 transcript isoforms.
Two of the groups (poor I and II) were associated with short
overall survival and one (good) with prolonged survival. Linking the BRCA1/2 mutation status to subgroup information
further increased the prognostic value.

Materials and Methods
PSFinder approach
PSFinder identiﬁes patient groups that (i) consist of features
(e.g., transcript isoforms or genes) whose expressions correlate
strongly across the samples and that exhibit distinct expression
patterns between patient groups and (ii) have statistically significant association with the clinical data, such as survival time. The
overall workﬂow of PSFinder is shown in Fig. 1.
PSFinder uses an iterative rule-based approach to search for
coexpressed features that are able to divide the samples into
groups that have signiﬁcant association to the clinical data. The
iterative process starts from all the samples in the cohort
proceeding to a subset of samples and is executed until there
are no features fulﬁlling the requirements to further divide the
subset of samples into groups. When given a set of samples,
PSFinder feature selection starts with seed search (step 1),
continues with initial clique collection (step 2), and iterative
clique merging (step 3), as shown in Fig. 1. After iterations, the
samples at the leaf nodes form subgroups, and all the features
used in the sample divisions are returned as markers for
prognostic subtype stratiﬁcation. The detailed steps of PSFinder
are in the Supplementary Material. PSFinder is available upon

Transcript isoform and gene level expression for TCGA ovarian
cancer patients
Exon array data (level 1; Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST v2) and
associated clinical information of two separate HGS-OvCa

2988 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

cohorts were downloaded from TCGA repository (12). The discovery cohort included 180 patients (from 13 different hospitals)
treated with platinum and taxane combination, and the validation cohort included 327 ovarian cancer samples from patients
(from 14 different hospitals) who are reported to have been given
various treatments in addition to platinum–taxane–based chemotherapy according to the TCGA patient treatment annotations.
Of note, it is possible that some patients in the discovery cohort
may have also received other treatments due to lack of treatment
annotations.
Exon array data were processed at transcript isoform level and
gene level by Multiple Exon Array Preprocessing (MEAP) algorithm (16). Transcripts differentially expressed between poor I
and good patients and between poor II and good patients were
collected by the t test (adjusted P < 0.05) and fold change
(absolute log2-scale FC  1).
Global hypermethylation in PSFinder subgroups
All probes (n ¼ 27,578) on HM27 methylation array from
180 and 326 patients with HGS-OvCa in the discovery and
validation sets were used in this analysis. Probes overlapping
with SNP, repeats, mapping to multiple locations or with poor
detection P values were masked. By using the same parameters
as in the study of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (17), we
investigated 16,355 CpG loci that are unmethylated in normal
ovary tissues (average DNA methylation b < 0.2) for cancerspeciﬁc hypermethylation. The percentage of hypermethylation
loci (b > 0.2) was calculated and visualized by boxplots for the
trend of increasing DNA promoter methylation in poor I
patients. A two-sided t test was used to evaluate the signiﬁcance
of the global DNA hypermethylation changes between the
groups.
Genes affected by promoter hypermethylation in poor I patients
Cancer-speciﬁc CpG hypermethylation loci (n ¼ 16,355)
described above were used in this analysis. A gene is said to be
affected by promoter hypermethylation based on the following
criteria: (i) signiﬁcant negative correlation between its promoter
CpG hypermethylation and gene expression (Spearman correlation coefﬁcient < 0.2 and adjusted P < 0.05), (ii) signiﬁcant CpG
hypermethylation changes in poor I versus poor II and poor I
versus good comparisons (two-sided t test P < 0.05), and (iii)
signiﬁcant expression changes in poor I versus poor II and poor I
versus good comparisons (two-sided t test P < 0.05).
HGS-OvCa cell lines
Three primary cell lines, M022i, M068i, and OC002, were
created, characterized using RNA sequencing, and used in drug
treatment experiments. M022i and M068i originated from ascites
ﬂuid collected during interval surgery after primary platinum
and taxane chemotherapy, whereas OC002 originates from samples taken during primary surgery before chemotherapy. Each
patient had rapidly progressing HGS-OvCa (overall survival, 4.0,
7.4, and 12.0 months for M022i, M068i, and OC002, respectively). All three primary cell lines and the established OVCAR-8 cell
line (NCI), which is classiﬁed as "possibly high-grade serous"
earlier (18), were grown as spheroids. OVCAR-8 was obtained
from DCTD Tumor/Cell Line Repository (NCI) on 2011, grown
for 2 to 4 passages before freezing, and assayed within 6 months
after thawing.

Prognostic Subgroup Discovery in Ovarian Cancer

Figure 1.
The overall workﬂow of PSFinder. PSFinder is an iterative rule–based approach to search for coexpressed features, which are able to divide the samples
into subgroups that have signiﬁcant association to the clinical data. Inputs consist of feature (transcript isoforms or genes) expression data from a
cohort of samples and survival times of the sample donors. The iterative process starts from all the samples in the cohort proceeding to a subset of samples
and is executed until there are no features fulﬁlling the requirements to further divide the subset of samples into groups (left tree). When given a
set of samples, PSFinder feature selection starts with seed search (step 1), continues with initial clique collection (step 2), and iterative clique merging (step 3).
In step 1, PSFinder identiﬁes individual features whose discretized expression values (high/low) are associated with statistically signiﬁcant survival
effect (Kaplan–Meier with log-rank test). These are used as seeds in step 2, where highly correlated transcripts (r  j 0.6 j in our case study) form initial
cliques. In step 3, PSFinder iteratively merges initial cliques into larger cliques until either (i) the correlation between the expression proﬁles or (ii) the
survival association in the merged clique falls under the threshold. From each iteration process, all the features from the merged clique with the
maximum score are selected as features to stratify the subset of samples. After iterations, the samples at the leaf nodes form subgroups and all the
features used in the sample divisions are returned as markers for prognostic type stratiﬁcation.

RNA sequencing and expression analysis for HGS-OvCa cell
lines
RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) with DNase I
treatment. The sequencing libraries were constructed in the
Beijing Genomics Institute using a modiﬁed protocol similar
to the TrueSeq Stranded Total RNA with RiboZero Kit (Illumina
Inc.) and sequenced with HiSeq2000 (Illumina Inc.) with the
standard protocol (pair-end sequencing with 100-bp read
length).
The RNA-seq data were processed and analyzed using an inhouse pipeline (Icay and colleagues, manuscript submitted).
Brieﬂy, 15 bp from the head and 20 bp from the tail of the raw
reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (19), followed by alignment to the human genome (hg19, Ensembl annotation version
75) using STAR (20) 2-pass alignment. Gene expression was
quantiﬁed by FPKM values using the Cufﬂinks–Cuffmerge–
Cuffquant–Cuffnorm pipeline (21).
Evaluation of DNA methylation inhibitor effect on cell viability
To evaluate the role of methylation, the primary and established cell lines were treated with decitabine (Selleckchem), which
is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase. Cells were plated on

www.aacrjournals.org

96-well plates with 2,500 cells per well. Decitabine was plated on
the 2 following days in ﬁnal concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and
10 mmol/L. Cell viability was measured 72 hours after the ﬁrst
treatment using the ATP Assay (CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell
Viability Assay, Promega) in at least 3 experiments with triplicate
wells each. The compound effect was assessed by activity area
(area above drug–response curve, AA), as suggested by Barretina
and colleagues (22), and by the percentage of AA out of total curve
area A(max) (AA%).
Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors
We used a Cox proportional hazard regression model (23)
containing known prognostic indicators, including age (continuous variable), stage (continuous variable), grade (continuous variable), residual disease (continuous variable),
BRCA1/2 mutation (categorical variable wild-type vs. mutype), and PSFinder prognostic classiﬁcation (categorical variable combined poor I and II vs. good prognostic groups) on
429 patients with HGS-OvCa from the discovery and validation sets with clinical survival data available. Ovarian cancer
BRCA1/2 mutation data were downloaded from cBioPortal for
Cancer Genomics (24).

Prospective ovarian cancer patient cohort (MUPET cohort)
As an independent validation set, we used a prospective
ovarian cancer cohort consisting of 29 patients with HGS-OvCa
treated at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Turku
University Hospital (Åbo, Finland; ClinicalTrials.gov Id:
NCT01276574). The study and the use of all clinical material
have been approved by (i) The Ethics Committee of the
Hospital District of Southwest Finland (ETMK): ETMK 53/
180/2009 x 238 and (ii) National Supervisory Authority for
Welfare and Health (Valvira): DNRO 6550/05.01.00.06/2010
and STH507A.
Patients were treated with either primary surgery followed by
six cycles of platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy or three
cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery and three to six chemotherapy cycles. The
treatment modality for each patient was determined on the
basis of preoperative imaging studies and diagnostic laparoscopy. Treatment response was determined with clinical examination, CA125 level, and contrast-enhanced CT using
RECIST1.1 criteria. Tumor and ascites samples were collected
during operation. One part of each specimen was snap-frozen
and another part was directly prepared for cell culture to
generate primary cell lines. Detailed clinical information is
shown in Table 1.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
RNA was extracted with RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reversetranscribed to cDNA using Tetro cDNA synthesis kit (Bioline)
and oligo dT primers. Expression of selected markers was determined in triplicate samples using TaqMan qRT-PCR with Applied
Biosystems 7900HT instrument (Finnish DNA Microarray Centre,
Turku Centre for Biotechnology, University of Turku, Turku,
Finland).
The primers and probes (listed in Supplementary Table S4)
were designed using Universal ProbeLibrary Assay Design Center
(Roche Applied Science). To select the optimal endogenous controls for the normalization of gene expression data, we studied the
expression of ACTB, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT1, RPL19, PPIA, and
TBP. On the basis of SLqPCR R-package (25) and BestKeeper (26),
PPIA and TBP were selected as the best reference genes in both
MUPET patient samples and cell lines. Raw qRT-PCR Ct values
were thus normalized against the geometric mean of PPIA and
TBP.

Results
Expression signature identiﬁed by PSFinder predicts prognosis
of platinum–taxane combination–treated HGS-OvCa patients
We analyzed isoform expression data from 180 treatment-na€ve
HGS-OvCa cancer samples available in the TCGA repository (12)
using PSFinder (Fig. 1). The samples originated from patients who
had a disseminated disease and were ﬁrst treated with surgery and
then with ﬁrst-line platinum–taxane combination therapy (clinical data in Table 1).
PSFinder analysis resulted in 61 coexpressed transcripts from
51 genes that divide the discovery cohort of 180 samples into
three groups (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S1). Two groups
(poor I and poor II) are associated with relatively short overall
survival and have markedly distinct expression proﬁles, whereas
one group (good) is associated with longer survival (log-rank test,
P ¼ 0.007; Fig. 2B). The median overall survival times for patients

2990 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

in poor I, poor II, and good groups were 45, 50, and >120 months,
respectively. The 5-year survival rates for poor I, poor II, and good
groups were 42%, 40%, and 68%, respectively. There were 3,724
differentially expressed transcripts (DET) between samples in
poor I versus good groups, whereas between poor II versus good,
there were only 657 DETs.
To further evaluate the reproducibility of the three subgroups
identiﬁed from the isoform-level expression data, we applied
PSFinder to gene-level expression data of the same 180 TCGA
HGS-OvCa samples. The gene-level analysis resulted in 32
genes that characterize three groups (Supplementary Table
S2 and Fig. S1), which are very similar to the isoform-level
results, although four samples identiﬁed into a poor prognosis
group in the isoform-level analysis were characterized as good
prognosis samples in the gene-level analysis. This small discrepancy is most likely due to the differences between isoformlevel and gene-level expression. Of the 32 genes, 18 were also
identiﬁed from the isoform-level, including 6 poor I
(AC083884.8, RP11-793H13.3, RP11-867G23.3, CERS6-AS1,
MAP1S, and KLF16) and 12 poor II (ADAM12, ADAMTS12,
AEBP1, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, COL6A1, COLEC12, FAP,
ITGA5, MMP14, and MMP2) genes. The 32 gene-level characterization markers allow the use of several HGS-OvCa cohorts
in the validation of poor I, poor II, and good subgroups as the
expression data from current available cohorts are mostly
measured by conventional microarrays.
We then compared the PSFinder results with two recently
published ovarian cancer prognostic signatures. First, Tothill
and colleagues used a two-step approach where they obtained
gene expression data to identify molecular subtypes in serous
and endometroid ovarian cancer and identiﬁed six subtypes
(C1–C6) that were linked to clinical outcome (8). When we
compared the 61 transcripts identiﬁed by PSFinder to the genes
characterizing C1–C6, we found that the poor II subtype is
almost identical to the C1 (high stromal response) molecular
subtype. Poor II is characterized by 25 coexpressed transcripts,
and 88% of them belong to the genes that deﬁne the C1 group.
As expected, the similarity is even more pronounced at the gene
level: all except 1 of 24 genes characterizing poor II are in the
gene list deﬁning C1. Patients in C1 have short overall survival
(8), which is also in accordance with the expected survival in
the poor II type. Second, we compared PSFinder results with the
CLOVAR survival signature, which is based on univariate Cox
regression analysis followed by correlation analysis resulting in
100 genes, whose gene expression was correlated with survival
(14). None of the 100 CLOVAR signature genes belonged to the
isoform- or gene-level results emerging from PSFinder. The lack
of overlap is not unexpected considering the different design
principles in CLOVAR and PSFinder; CLOVAR uses univariate
Cox regression to identify genes with lowest P values, whereas
PSFinder ﬁnds groups of coexpressed genes with survival association. We tested univariate Cox regression on genes identiﬁed
by the CLOVAR approach using the 180 TCGA patients with
HGS-OvCa treated with platinum and taxane combination.
From the 100 genes identiﬁed by CLOVAR, only 22% were
signiﬁcantly associated (P < 0.05) with overall survival.
Eight independent HGS-OvCa validation cohorts conﬁrm the
robustness of the PSFinder results
To test the universality of the PSFinder identiﬁed poor
and good survival types, we used two independent cohorts

for transcript-level validation and six independent cohorts for
gene-level validation.
The ﬁrst transcript-level validation cohort (TCGA validation
cohort) consists of transcript level data from 327 patients with
ovarian cancer from the TCGA repository who have received some
other chemotherapy in addition to platinum–taxane–based treatment. Patients from this cohort have been subjected to varying
treatment regimens, which may introduce a bias to the survival
times, as some drugs can prolong and other drugs can shorten the
overall survival of the patients independent of the platinum–
taxane treatment effect predicted by the PSFinder signature. The
subgroup prediction using the 61-transcript predictor [linear
predictor score (LPS) in Supplementary Material] revealed three
subgroups sharing similar expression proﬁles as the TCGA discovery set (log-rank test, P ¼ 0.015; Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Fig. S2). The poor I group has only 30 patients in the TCGA
validation cohort, which may cause unstable estimates in the
Kaplan–Meier analysis. Therefore, we combined the poor I and II
groups, leading to 123 poor responding patients, with the available survival data and observed a clear difference between poor
and good survival (P ¼ 0.014, Fig. 2D).
In the second transcript-level validation, we used transcript
isoform–speciﬁc qRT-PCR in a prospective cohort (MUPET)
consisting of primary cancer samples from 29 patients with
HGS-OvCa who received platinum–taxane–based chemotherapy
(clinical data in Table 1; ref. 27). There were speciﬁc assays
available for 24 transcripts in Universal ProbeLibrary Assay
Design Center (lifescience.roche.com; Roche Diagnostics) and
only nine produced robust signals in all the samples. By using
these nine markers as a subgroup predictor, we calculated LPS for
each sample and 14%, 38%, and 48% patients were classiﬁed into

2992 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

poor I, poor II, and good subgroups, respectively (Fig. 2E).
Because of the small size of the cohort, we combined poor I and
poor II into a single "Poor group," which showed signiﬁcantly
shorter survival times than the good prognosis group (log-rank
test, P ¼ 0.030; Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. S3). All markers,
except PPP1CC, exhibit similar expression proﬁles in the MUPET
subgroups as in the TCGA poor I, poor II, and good samples
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
To further evaluate the reproducibility of the PSFinder results,
we used gene expression data from AOCS (8), Yoshihara (28),
Ferriss (29), Crijns (30), Mok (31), and Mateescu (32) cohorts
containing a total of 558 patients with HGS-OvCa. The expression
data in these 6 cohorts are measured using various microarray
designs and 38% of poor I and 100% of poor II characterization
genes identiﬁed by PSFinder from the gene-level analysis were
available in these validation cohorts. Despite the suboptimal
number of poor I genes available for prognostic type prediction
using the LPS method, the groups with similar expression proﬁles
and survival associations as in the TCGA discovery set were still
reproduced (Fig. 3).
Increased promoter hypermethylation is a characteristic of
poor I patients
While poor II corresponds to the high stromal response molecular subtype, poor I type has not been identiﬁed earlier and
none of the transcripts or genes that characterize poor I were
reported by Tothill and colleagues or CLOVAR. Even though gene
microarrays lack many of the poor I characterizing genes, the
lack of overlap was unexpected because C1–C6 subtypes are
deﬁned by approximately 7,700 genes (8), and many of the
C1–C6 groups are associated with poor survival. Because TCGA

provides also miRNA and DNA methylation data, we investigated
whether poor I can be characterized at epigenetic or miRNA
expression level. At the miRNA level, there were no miRNAs that
were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed between poor I and
poor II (nominal P < 0.05, absolute fold change > 2), which
suggests that poor I is not different from poor II at the miRNA
regulation level.
A possible cause for the distinct gene expression proﬁle in
poor I type is DNA methylation, and thus we explored DNA
promoter hypermethylation differences between poor I and
other types. The frequency of hypermethylated CpG loci in
poor I samples (mean frequency 5.1% in the discovery set and

www.aacrjournals.org

4.7% in the validation set) is signiﬁcantly higher than that in
poor II (mean frequency 4.1% in the discovery set and 4.0% in
the validation set) or good (mean frequency 3.7% in the
discovery set and 3.6% in the validation set) tumor samples
and normal ovary tissue samples in both TCGA discovery and
validation cohorts (Fig. 4A and B).
Differential methylation analysis between poor I versus good
(Fig. 4C) and poor I versus poor II (Fig. 4D) resulted in 178 and
153 signiﬁcantly differentially methylated CpG loci (j Db j > 0.1
and multiple-hypotheses corrected P < 0.001), respectively. The
number of common CpG loci identiﬁed by both comparisons is
140, of which all except one (cg11484576) exhibit higher

hypermethylation in poor I samples. There were no signiﬁcant
differences at the DNA methylation level between poor II and
good types (Supplementary Fig. S5). The genes whose expressions
were affected by promoter hypermethylation on the basis of the
criteria described in Materials and Methods include several transcription regulators, such as TOP3B and RPAP2 (Supplementary
Fig. S6 and Table S3).
DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) are enzymes that catalyze
the addition of a methyl group to cytosine residues at CpG loci
and play key roles in establishing the global or regional hypermethylation patterns in cancers (33). Thus, we studied the expressions of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B in poor I, poor II, and
good patient groups and observed signiﬁcant upregulation of two
full-length protein-coding isoforms (ENST00000328111 and
ENST00000348286) and 1 shorter form (ENST00000537219)
of the de novo methyltransferase DNMT3B in poor I samples
(Supplementary Fig. S7). High expression levels of DNMT3B have
been reported in several cancers, including breast cancer, endometrial cancers, and leukemia (34–36), and DNMT3B has been
shown to promote tumorigenesis (37). This suggests that de novo
methylation mediated by DNMT3B may contribute to the
formation of aberrant hypermethylation patterns in poor I
HGS-OvCa samples.
Methylation inhibition exhibits strong effects on poor I
characteristic HGS-OvCa cell lines
As samples in the poor I group are signiﬁcantly more hypermethylated than samples in poor II or good groups, we tested
whether DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (decitabine) is able to decrease viability of HGS-OvCa cells in samples
with poor I characteristics. Decitabine inhibits the function of
DNMTs leading to reduced DNA methylation (38). We used three
patient-derived cell lines and 1 control cell line (Fig. 4E): OC002
and M022i (high expression levels of poor I genes) and M068i
(low expression levels of poor I genes) and compared the cytotoxic effects to control cell line OVCAR8 (very low expression
levels of poor I genes).
When we tested decitabine on these four cisplatin-resistant
HGS-OvCa cell lines, the greatest effect was seen in OC002
followed by M022i, M068i, and OVCAR8 (Fig. 4F and Supplementary Fig. S8). The cytotoxic effects were most signiﬁcant at the
concentrations of 0.1 to 1 mmol/L (Fig. 4G), and the effects
correlate with the overall expression of DNMT3A and DNMT3B
(Fig. 4H), which are targets of decitabine (39). IC50 values are
provided in Supplementary Fig. S8. These results are in line with
the hypothesis that cancer cells with higher expressions of poor I
characterizing genes are more responsive to decitabine.
Combining PSFinder expression signature and BRCA1/2
mutation data improves stratiﬁcation of HGS-OvCa patients
Patients with ovarian cancer with dysfunctional DNA repair
genes BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 have increased overall survival due to

better response to cytotoxic chemotherapy (40). Thus, we examined whether BRCA1/2 dysfunction could explain the three
groups identiﬁed by PSFinder, and whether integrating PSFinder
predictor and BRCA1/2 mutation status is able to improve the
classiﬁcation of platinum–taxane–treated individuals into different outcome groups.
BRCA1/2 mutation data were available for 117 samples in the
TCGA discovery cohort and 139 samples in the TCGA validation
cohort. BRCA1/2 mutation carriers had longer overall survival
than BRCA1/2 wild-type patients as expected (log-rank test,
P ¼ 0.0004; Supplementary Fig. S9). The mutation status of
BRCA1/2 does not show enrichment in any of the PSFinder
identiﬁed types (Fig. 5A). This suggests that there are other
factors involved in predicting outcome of a patient with HGSOvCa to platinum and taxane therapy. Indeed, multivariate
Cox regression analysis using age, grade, stage, residual disease,
BRCA1/2 mutation status, and PSFinder identiﬁed types shows
that the strongest predictors of HGS-OvCa patient outcome are
the BRCA1/2 mutation status (P ¼ 0.0003) and the PSFinder
identiﬁed prognostic types (P ¼ 0.02; Table 2). While the low
predictive power of grade and stage was not unexpected
because of the cohort selection, the importance of PSFinder
subgroups over tumor debulking is of interest, as the extent of
residual disease after primary cytoreductive surgery is regarded
as a signiﬁcant prognosticator in clinical practice (41).
We combined poor I and poor II types and BRCA1/2 mutation
status information into the following groups: (i) good prognosis
with BRCA1/2 mutation ("good-mu"); (ii) good prognosis
with wild-type BRCA1/2 ("good-wt"); (iii) poor prognosis with
BRCA1/2 mutation ("poor-mu"); and (iv) poor prognosis
with BRCA1/2 wild-type ("poor-wt") groups. Strikingly, none of
the BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in the good prognostic group of
the discovery set died during the 5-year follow-up period whereas
61% of the "poor-wt" patients died (Fig. 5B). The annotation of
prognostic subgroups and BRCA1/2 status for patients from the
TCGA discovery and validation sets is available in Supplementary
Tables S5 and S6.
The improved prognostic accuracy due to the combination of
BRCA1/2 mutation status and PSFinder types was further validated in the TCGA validation cohort (Fig. 5C). Thus, combined
PSFinder and BRCA1/2 dysfunction data provides better segregation of responders than either one alone in identifying patient
who beneﬁt from platinum and taxane treatment.

Discussion
The ability to separate poor and good responders to the
HGS-OvCa ﬁrst-line therapy, platinum and taxane combination regimen, is crucial for implementation of precision medicine to ovarian cancer. We have developed a novel computational approach PSFinder that allows identiﬁcation of patients
with poor and good prognosis after chemotherapy using

PSFinder uses an iterative rule–based approach to search for
coexpressed features, which enables forming groups that have
statistically signiﬁcant association to a clinical endpoint, such
as overall survival, and the transcripts or genes characterizing a
group are tightly coexpressed. The major ﬁndings of this study
include: (i) identiﬁcation of a novel poor outcome group of
patients with HGS-OvCa treated with surgery and platinum and
taxane combination therapy; (ii) association of this group with
increased DNA hypermethylation and demonstration of the
effect of decitabine in cancer cells belonging to this group; (iii)

nostic test; and (iv) demonstration of the additive prognostic
value of the combination of PSFinder markers and BRCA1/2
pathogenic mutation over either test alone.
When we applied PSFinder to clinical and expression data
measured by exon arrays from platinum–taxane–treated
HGS-OvCa patients, we identiﬁed two poor (poor I and poor II)
and one signiﬁcantly better (good) outcome groups. Poor II type
corresponds to the high stromal response molecular subtype (42).
Poor overall survival in poor II or high stromal response type is in
line with recent results that highlight the importance of stromal
cell types in response to therapy (1). However, the overall survival
of the poor I type is equally poor to the poor II type, which
suggests that there are other factors than stromal response that
play a key role in drug resistance. The poor I type has not been
reported earlier and several genes that characterize poor I type
have not been associated with poor survival in ovarian cancer.
This is mostly due to the fact that the genes characterizing poor I
type are not present in traditional gene microarrays, which also
hindered our efforts to validate the poor I type in earlier cohorts. A
few poor I characteristic genes, however, have been linked to drug
response. For instance, PARG is a DNA repair gene that has been
indicated in ovarian cancer tumor growth and drug response (43);
BEST1 is a regulator of an ion channel, which is suggested as one of
the major mechanisms conveying drug resistance in ovarian

cancer (44); and CXCL3, which is a proinﬂammatory chemokine,
has been recently suggested as a therapeutic target in ovarian
cancer (45).
Samples belonging to the poor I type have signiﬁcantly
higher rate of promoter hypermethylation than samples
belonging to poor II or good types, which prompted us to
test the effect of DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine in four
HGS-OvCa cell lines. Earlier studies have examined the combinatorial effects of decitabine and platinum and demonstrated
that nontoxic doses of decitabine sensitize ovarian tumor
xenografts to platinum (46) and decitabine can be combined
safely with platinum (47). A recent phase II trial, however, did
not ﬁnd increased efﬁcacy when decitabine and platinum were
combined, most likely because of nonoptimal patient selection
strategy (48). Our results suggest that poor I type samples are
more sensitive to decitabine than other samples. Therefore, it is
tempting to speculate that the PSFinder signature could be
useful to stratify patients in clinical trials that test the effect of
decitabine alone or in combination with other agents.
PSFinder identiﬁed a set of only 61 transcripts as putative
prognostic biomarkers to platinum–taxane–treated HGS-OvCa
patients, which provides a solid basis for further work to develop a
diagnostic assay. Indeed, one of the clinically applicable major
ﬁndings in this study is the combination of PSFinder signature
and BRCA1/2 mutation status to predict the effect of platinum
and taxane therapy from treatment-na€ve tumor specimens. The
use of PSFinder predicted types and BRCA1/2 mutation status
allowed identiﬁcation of patients with HGS-OvCa who truly
beneﬁt from platinum and taxane combination therapy. In the
discovery and validation sets, this group of excellent responders
included approximately 8% of the patients in the cohort.
In conclusion, our novel computational approach identiﬁed a
restricted set of previously unknown isoform-level biomarkers. In
combination with the BRCA mutation information, this panel
may be used for stratiﬁcation of patients with HGS-OvCa on the
basis of their response to state-of-the-art platinum–taxane combination therapy. Identiﬁcation of the extreme responders and
primarily chemoresistant patients can help develop alternative
treatment strategies and select patients for future therapeutic
trials.
