ABSTRACT
Among the diverse factors that may influence the therapeutic outcomes, the
exocytosis of targeted drug delivery systems (TDDS) and its relationship with the
corresponding receptor receive little attentions. In this study, cRGDfK modified gold
nanoparticles (cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs) were synthesized, and their cellular transportation
including endocytosis and exocytosis, as well as the potential relations with αvβ3 integrin
were carefully studied. The results showed that the enhanced and fast internalization
of cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs into U87 cells was associated with the high expression level of
αvβ3 integrin. Importantly, the significant exocytosis of cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs, but not the
PEG conjugated gold nanoparticles (PEG-AuNPs), was found under the in vivo-simulated
serum containing conditions. Interestingly, the exocytosis kinetics of nanoparticles was
demonstrated to be tightly related with the recycling of the αvβ3 integrin, although
the exocytosis of cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs slightly lagged behind the receptor recycling. In
effect, our findings uncover a new underlying behavior of receptor mediated TDDS and
have implication for their rational design and application in the future.

INTRODUCTION

By modifying the blood circulation and tissue distribution,
improved therapeutic efficacy and limited adverse effects
could be achieved [6, 7]. However, there is still no
enormous progress up today. Even though some active
targeting therapeutic nanomedicines are under clinical
trials, there are still no products available in commerce
[8]. Enormous investigations have been processed on the
complicated biological steps during systemic delivery
of nanomedicine, such as the formation of corona [9],
the aberrant extracellular matrix of solid tumors [10],
the heterogeneity of surface receptor expression [2], the
intracellular drug release [11], the “binding site barrier”
phenomenon [12], etc. Several constructive progresses
have been made in prolonging the drug circulation half-life
[13, 14], modulating the formation of corona, promoting

Malignant tumor is considered to be one of the most
serious diseases and the main cause of death worldwide.
Cancer therapy has now become a global conundrum
[1, 2]. Although chemotherapy is the main therapeutic
approach in clinic at present, the poor therapeutic effect
along with the non-negligible side reaction impedes its
development.
Active targeting, especially receptor-mediated
TDDS, attracts tremendous attention of scientists ever
since the past 30 years [3–5]. Receptor-mediated TDDS,
which could be typically achieved by utilizing ligands,
namely on the basis of ligand-receptor interaction, could
specifically deliver the active drugs to where needed.

the penetration of nanomedicine to solid tumors through
microenvironment responsive TDDS [15], optimizing
the targeting efficiency through modifying the density
of ligands [16] and so on. With respect to the cellular
mechanisms of nanoparticles, tremendous attention has
been put on the interaction between the nanomedicine and
targeted cells, the subsequent endocytosis and intracellular
trafficking pathways [17]. Nevertheless, a comprehensive
understanding of the exocytosis of active targeted
nanomedicine is rare [18, 19].
It has been well known that many receptors, such as
integrins, undergo intracellular recycling pathway which
is considered to play a crucial rule in the proliferation,
migration and invasion of malignant tumors [20, 21]. In
general, the receptor was internalized with the ligand as
a complex. After that, the ligand is usually dissociated
from the complex and then degraded while the receptor
recycles back to the cell surface and is reutilized [22–25].
Traditional opinion believes that such dissociation
and reutilization are responsible for the promoted
internalization of active targeted nanomedicine [8, 26].
Namely, the ligand-modified nanomedicine is retained
in cell through the release of the ligand from the
receptor after facilitated endocytosis. While, we have
no idea if there exists the exocytosis of ligand-modified
nanomedicine and what the relationship with the efflux of
receptor is.
In this study, αvβ3 integrin, which has been
extensively studied for its abnormal overexpression on
tumor cells of various origin [27], was used as receptor
model. Cyclic pentapeptides cRGDfK, which was proved
to be the specific ligand for αvβ3 integrin [28, 29], was
selected to prepare active targeted particles (cRGDfKPEG-AuNPs). The exocytosis of the particles and the
recycling of the receptor (αvβ3 integrin) were studied and
analyzed by using confocal laser scanning microscope
(CLSM), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) and capture-enzyme linked immune sorbent
assay (capture-ELISA), in order to find out the associations
between them.

As seen in Figure 1B, along with the disulfide linker CMPEG-S-S-PEG-CM, there also exists chemicals with a
molecular weight of around 2200 which may be ascribed
to the unreacted HS-PEG-CM. Further experiment proved
that these chemicals wouldn’t influence the formation of
cRGDfK functionalized polymers and could be removed
during the dialysis process (Figure 1C). The final products
were actually a mixture of cRGDfK-PEG-S-S-PEG-cRGDfK
and cRGDfK-PEG-S-S-PEG-CM as shown in (Figure 1C).
Both of the two types of polymers could be conjugated to the
surface of AuNPs.

Preparation and characterization of the
functionalized AuNPs
The size and shape of nanoparticles was thought to
play a great role in the cellular uptake process. Spherical
nanoparticles with the size of 50 nm, which were proved to
enter the cells more effectively and can reach the maximum
uptake by a cell [31, 32], were used in our study. As seen in
Figure 2A and Supplementary Table 1, the average particles
size of unmodified AuNPs determined by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) was about 40nm and increased to 50–
60 nm when conjugated to linkers. The size of cRGDfKPEG-AuNPs was slightly higher than that of PEG-AuNPs
due to the modification of cRGDfK [33, 34]. But there
was no significant difference both in particle size and in
surface charge (Figure 2A, 2B and Supplementary Table 1).
The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of
cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs and PEG-AuNPs showed spheroidal
morphology and the core diameters were identical with that
of AuNPs obtained by DLS.
Among the many ways to stabilize AuNPs, the
most robust one was to form strong Au-S bond by adding
thiolates [35]. In this article, the formation of Au-S
bond was detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis (Figure 2C). The binding energy of
Au4f5/2, Au4f7/2 and S2p3/2 were 87.63eV, 83.98eV
and 162.5eV respectively indicating that the AuNPs had
been successfully modified by HS-PEG-CM and cRGDfK
functionalized linkers through Au-S bond [36].

RESULTS
Synthesis of cRGDfK functionalized polymer

Receptor expression and cytotoxicity of
PEG-AuNPs and cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs

In order to conjugate pentapeptides cRGDfK with
HS-PEG-CM through amidation reaction, HS-PEG-CM
was firstly dimerized through a disulfide bond to avoid
the formation of other complex structures [30]. The
divalent CM-PEG-S-S-PEG-CM was activated as
N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester and then reacted with
the amine group of cRGDfK in PBS (pH 7.5) (Figure 1A).
Both the dipolymers and the cRGDfK conjugated polymers
were successfully synthesized determined by MALDI-TOFMS (Figure 1B) and the conjugation rate of cRGDfK was
about 96% determined by HPLC analysis (data not shown).

In order to assess the effects of receptor on
the endocytosis and exocytosis of PEG-AuNPs and
cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs, two types of cells were selected
based on the expression level of αvβ3 integrins. Here,
the receptor expression levels were validated by using
immunofluorescence method. As shown in Figure 3A
and  3B, U87 cells exhibited high expression of αvβ3
integrin while MCF-7 cells manifested little.
Determined by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay,

Au content range from 0.016 μg/ml to 266.24 μg/ml did

following cellular study.

internalization in U87 cells compared to PEG-AuNPs,
while the internalization of them showed no difference in
MCF-7 cells (Figure 5A). The results were consolidated
by the ICP-MS analysis (Figure 4A). To further verify the
integrin αvβ3 associated to the endocytosis of cRGDfKPEG-AuNPs, receptor competition experiment was
conducted. As shown in Figure 5B, the internalization
of cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs in U87 cells was inhibited by
pretreatment with free cRGDfK. Hence, the integrin αvβ3mediated endocytosis is special for cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs
rather than PEG-AuNPs.

Endocytosis study
To compare the difference of cellular uptake
kinetics between passive targeting PEG-AuNPs and active
targeting cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs in U87 cells, we firstly
performed an ICP-MS analysis of cells incubated with
different AuNPs for a given time. As shown in Figure 4A,
in the first 10 min post administration, the uptake of
cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs exhibit faster kinetics compared to
PEG-AuNPs. The amount of endocytosed cRGDfK-PEGAuNPs was larger than that of PEG-AuNPs and this was
enlarged at the end of the incubation time (Supplementary
Figure 1). The CLSM observation also validated the
similar trends (Figure 4B). After incubation for 5 min
at 37°C, cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs performed considerable
intracellular characteristic while no significant
endocytosed PEG-AuNPs was observed, and at the end of
incubation for 15 min, the gap was expanded. Both types
of AuNPs exhibited a time-dependent endocytosis activity.
In order to illustrate that the faster cellular uptake
kinetics undertaken by cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs was
attributed to integrin αvβ3-mediated endocytosis, cellular
uptake of nanoparticles was carried out with MCF-7 cells
as control group independent of αvβ3. After incubation
for 1 h, cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs exhibited the enhanced

Exocytosis study
Targeting efficiency is a key character in evaluating
the efficacy of a targeted preparation. Researches had
proved that not only the internalized quantity but also
the intracellular pathways and the consequent fate could
influence the efficacy of a given preparation [37–39]. So
in this part, we conducted experiments to investigate the
possibility of nanoparticle exocytosis and its relationship
with the receptor recycling.
As shown in Figure 6A, exocytosis could be
obviously observed in cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs group and
the maximum efflux occurred at 7.5 min. The intracellular
cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs increased again when U87 cells
were processed for another 2.5 min. At the end of 15 min,
the amount of cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs remained in U87
cells was slightly decreased compared to that at 10 min,

but larger than that at 7.5 min. This indicated that the
exocytosis still existed but became weak to somehow. As
expected, no such trends were observed in PEG-AuNPs
group, which illustrated that the exocytosis may be related
to cRGD-mediated cellular trafficking of nanoparticles.
To further verify the specific exocytosis of cRGDfKPEG-AuNPs in U87 cells, two other experiments were
conducted. The first one is using primaquine as exocytosis
inhibitor. Primaquine, a kind of amines, could neutralize
acidic subcellular compartments and hence influence the
intracellular trafficking of endosomes [40–42]. In the
presence of primaquine, the evident efflux of cRGDfKPEG-AuNPs at 7.5 min was disappeared as well as the
phenomena existed at 10 min and 15 min. The exocytosis
of PEG-AuNPs in U87 cells was not affected (Figure
6B). In another experiment, exocytosis investigation of
cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs was performed in MCF-7 cells
(Figure 6C). The similar exocytosis character of cRGDfKPEG-AuNPs in U87 cells was still not detected.
As the exocytosis was only observed in cRGDfKPEG-AuNPs other than PEG-AuNPs, and only in U87
cells other than MCF-7 cells, the efflux of cRGDfK-PEGAuNPs seemed to be in relationship with αvβ3 receptors
to some extent. To testify this assumption, an ELISA
analysis was conducted. A schematic representation of
the mechanism was illustrated in Figure 7A. The results
were listed in Figure 7B. We found that the addition
of primaquine increased the intracellular amount of
labeled αvβ3 integrin significantly after the cells were re-

incubated for 5 min and longer, indicating that some of the
αvβ3 integrins had recycled back to the cell membrane.
At the end of 7.5 min, the labeled αvβ3 integrin remained
in cells decreased sharply compared to that at 5 min and
reached to the minimum level among the seven time
points investigated, showing that much more labeled
αvβ3 integrins had returned back. Similar to the exocytosis
of cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs, labeled αvβ3 integrin was
supposed to internalized again based on the reality that the
OD values of biotin increased comprehensively at 10 min
compared to that at 7.5 min.

DISCUSSION
In this study, the difference of endocytosis and
exocytosis between cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs and PEGAuNPs were investigated. The results showed that
cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs internalized into U87 cells more
quickly than PEG-AuNPs did due to the interaction with
αvβ3 integrin. More significantly, the exocytosis was
found to exist in cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs rather than PEGAuNPs, and the efflux of cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs was
demonstrated to relate with the rapid recycling of αvβ3
integrin under the serum containing conditions.
In fact, this study was the intensive research on what
we had found previously. cRGDfK had been proved to
travel two quite different pathways under different culture
conditions. When incubated in serum-containing DMEM,
the peptide cRGDfK seemed to recycle back to the leading

lamella within the 15 minutes’ in U87 cells. (data not shown,
to be published). In consistent with our findings, Norman et
al. [43] had found out that αvβ3 integrin would pass through
the early endosomes to reach the endocytic recycling
compartment about 30 min after internalization in the
absence of serum. But after administration with PDGF, αvβ3
integrin would recycle back to the cell surface much more
quickly via a rab4-dependent fast recycling pathway. As a
matter of fact, tremendous reports had proved that integrin
might pursue disparate recycle pathways. For example, it has
been reported that inactive form of β1 integrin recycles via
Arf6/rab 35 dependent pathway whereas active form of β1
integrin avoids this recycling pathway [44, 45].

Furthermore, Brenner had proved that integrin
β3 could be internalized through a micropinocytosis
route under the PDGF-stimulated conditions. With the
function of PDGF, micropinocytosis of integrin β3 was
generated and was proved to be the main pathway in
the accelerated exocytosis [46]. We also conducted an
endocytosis pathway study (Supplementary Materials).
The results showed that clathrin-mediated process was
obvious during the endocytosis of cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs.
Interestingly, as to EIPA, a sodium-proton channel
blocker, which could inhibit a dynamin-independent
pathway named as macropinocytosis [47], deceased
the cellular uptake of cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs evidently

(Supplementary Figure 2B), which means that apart from
clathrin-dependent endocytosis, cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs
may use macropinocytosis pathway which also could be
αvβ3-containing route to enter the U87 cells. Because all

the cells used in our study were cultured using serumcontaining medium, we deduced that the exocytosis of
cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs in U87 cells was somehow in
correlation with the fast recycling of the αvβ3 integrin.

That did not imply the excluding of other mechanisms
that might exist in U87 cells. In considering that the total
intracellular amount of cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs increased

with time, and the decreasement extent of cRGDfKPEG-AuNPs at 15 min was not as large as that at 7.5 min
(Figure 6A), we infer that after internalization, at least

two itineraries are used by cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs in U87
cells. As shown in Figure 8, one is rapid recycling and
the exocytosis of cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs might be in close
relationship with this way. As to the exactly mechanism,
such as the role of mRme-1 (G429R, an ERC-associated
protein) [48], the function of APPL1 endosomes [49], and
other routes are not mentioned in this study [50].
Then a relative clear conclusion could be
ascertained that, along with the increased internalization
via αvβ3 integrin-mediated endocytosis, the receptordependent exocytosis was also non-negligible. So, we
strongly suggest that during the evaluation of active
TDDS, the exocytosis especially the relationship with the
corresponding receptor should be taken into consideration.
Moreover, the cell culture conditions should also be taken
seriously for serum containing or not could influence the
recycling pathway of some receptors significantly. It is
expected these findings could provide guidance for studies
on active TDDS.

NHSS (6.00 mg) was added to the solution of
CM-PEG-S-S-PEG-CM (50.00 mg) in 3 mL of fresh
distilled DMF. Under nitrogen, DCC (6.80 mg) was
added to activate the carboxyl end. DMF was removed
under reduced pressure. The dry product obtained was redissolved in 2 mL of PBS containing 25% (v/v) CH3CN
and then cRGDfK (5.00 mg) was added. After adjusting
the pH to about 7.5 by NaOH (0.2 N), the reaction was
processed and monitored by TLC. The final reaction
solution was purified using dialysis bag (Mw cut off 3500)
and lyophilized. The cRGDfK-PEG-S-S-PEG-cRGDfK
was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS.

Preparation and characterization of the
functionalized AuNPs
To prepare PEG conjugated AuNPs (PEG-AuNPs),
5 mL of cold tetrachloroauric acid trihydrate solution
(0.04%, w/v) and 1 mL of cold NaBH4 solution (0.005 M)
were mixed rapidly and the reaction was processed with
vigorous stirring for 3 h. After that, 1 mL of HS-PEGCM (0.002M) solution was added and the reaction was
proceeded for another 1 h. For the preparation of cRGDfK
functionalized AuNPs (cRGDfK-PEG-AuNPs), 200 μL
of tetrachloroauric acid trihydrate solution (1%, w/v) and
1 mL of cRGDfK functionalized disulfide linker (0.001 M)
was mixed with 3.8 ml of cold Milli-Q water firstly, and
then 1 mL of NaBH4 solution (0.007 M) was added to the
mixture rapidly. The reaction was processed on ice bath
with vigorous stirring for 3 h.
After the reaction was finished, the suspension
obtained was centrifuged (13000 rpm, 10 min) and purified
with PBS to remove the unbound linker. Finally, the
modified AuNPs was maintained in PBS for further use.
DLS (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern, UK) was used
to determine the particle size and zeta potential. TEM
(JEOL, JEM-200CX, Japan) was used to investigate the
shape and surface morphology of AuNPs. The Au-S bond
was detected by XPS (Kratos, AXIS Ultra DLD, Japan).

αvβ3 (ab78289, Abcam, UK) at 37°C for 2 h. PBS was
used as negative control. Alexa Fluor® 647 conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (A-21236, Invitrogen, US)
was used as secondary antibody, and incubated with
cells at 37°C in the dark for 2 h. Cell nuclei was stained
by Hoechst 33258 at room temperature for 15 min. The
images were observed using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal
laser scanning microscope (CLSM, Heidelberg, Germany).
The human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were maintained in
RPMI1640 medium. And all the procedures dealing with
cell treatment were the same as U87 cells.

For ICP-MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) analysis,, U87
cells were seeded in 12-well plates and cultured to about 80%
confluence. After incubating with PEG-AuNPs or cRGDfKAuNPs solutions (containing 12 μg/ml Au) in complete
culture medium at 37°C for a given time (5 min, 10 min, 30
min and 60 min), the supernatant was removed and rinsed
with cold PBS for 3 times. Then the cells were trypsinized by
0.25% trypsin without EDTA and detached from the wells.
Cell pellets were obtained and washed with cold PBS for
3 times by centrifugation and then were lysed using RIPA
solution. The Au contents were measured by ICP-MS by
dissolving the lysate in aqua regia. The protein contents were
determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method.

Cytotoxicity study of PEG-AuNPs and cRGDfKPEG-AuNPs

Receptor competitive experiments
After incubation with PEG-AuNPs or cRGDfKAuNPs (containing 12 μg/ml Au), cells were rinsed and
fixed with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde respectively. In
order to demarcate the outline of the cell, cell staining with
acridine orange (AO) was processed at room temperature
for 7 min. The cells were then observed using a Leica TCS
SP8 CLSM. The endocytosed AuNPs was also quantified
by ICP-MS method described above.
U87 cells were pre-incubated with free cRGDfK (50
μg/ml) for 30 min prior to the addition of cRGDfK-PEGAuNPs solution (containing 12 μg/ml Au and 50 μg/ml
free cRGDfK). After incubation for another 1 h, the
cells were then rinsed, trypsinized and lysed using RIPA
solution. Au content was measured using ICP-MS method
as mentioned above.

The cytotoxicity of PEG-AuNPs and cRGDfKPEG-AuNPs was investigated by SRB assay [51]. Cells
were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3.5 × 104/ml
in 200 μl culture medium per well and were cultured under
37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the culture medium was
removed carefully, and cells were treated with a set of
diluted solutions of PEG-AuNPs or cRGDfK-AuNPs in
complete culture medium for 48 h. After removing the
supernatant gingerly, 200 μl of trichloroacetic acid (TCA,
10% w/v, 4°C) per well was added to fix the cells at 4°C
for 1 h. The 96-well plates were then washed by deionized
water for 5 times and air dried. 100 μl of SRB solution
(0.4%, w/v, dissolved in 1% acetic acid) per well was
added for a 0.5 h staining at room temperature. Then the
supernatant was removed, and the plates were washed
by acetic acid solution (1%, v/v) for 5 times. After airdrying for a night at room temperature, Tris base solution
(10 mM, 200 μl per well) was added and the 96-well plates
were vibrated for 0.5 h to make the dye bounded to the
protein dissolved completely. The optical density values
of each well were recorded at the wavelength of 540 nm
by using a microplate reader. The only complete medium
incubation without cells and AuNPs adding was set as
blank control and the only complete medium incubation of
cells without AuNPs adding was set as possitive control.

Cellular exocytosis studies
Exocytosis kinetics of functionalized AuNPs
U87 cells or MCF-7 cells were seeded in 12-well
plates and were cultured to about 80% confluence. PEGAuNPs or cRGDfK-AuNPs (containing 12 μg/ml Au)
were administrated and co-cultured with cells for 4 h at
37°C. Then the supernatant was removed and the cells
were rinsed with PBS for 3 times. Fresh complete culture
medium with or without primaquine that had been prewarmed to 37°C was added and the cells were incubated
at 37°C for a certain time (0 min, 5 min, 7.5 min, 10 min,
15 min, 30 min). As soon as the incubation finished, the
plates were transferred onto ice and washed with cold
PBS for 3 times. The Au content remained in cells and the
protein content were detected by ICP-MS and BCA assay
respectively as described above.

Cellular endocytosis studies
Endocytosis kinetics
For CLSM studies, cells were cultured in a glass
bottom dish to about 80% confluence. After removing
the medium, cells were exposed to PEG-AuNPs or
cRGDfK-AuNPs solutions (containing 12 μg/ml Au) in
complete culture medium at 37°C. After a given period
of time, cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed by
4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 37°C. Cell nuclei was
stained by Hoechst 33258. The cells were then observed
using TCS SP8 CLSM. The AuNPs were observed by
using the reflection spectrum method. [30, 52].

Recycling kinetics of αvβ3 integrin in U87 cells
U87 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured
to about 80% confluence. The plates were maintained
at 4°C for 10 min before further treatment. The culture
medium was removed and the cells were washed with
PBS at 0°C for 3 times. After that, 1 ml of pre-cooling
NHS-SS-biotin solution (0.15 mg/ml) in serum-free

DMEM was added and co-cultured with cells for 30 min
at 0°C. Then the supernatant was removed and the cells
was rinsed with cold PBS for 3 times. 1 ml of fresh
complete DMEM with or without 8 M primaquine that
had pre-warmed to 37°C was added and the cells were
cultured at 37°C for a reserved time (2 min, 3 min, 4 min,
5 min, 7.5 min, 10 min). After incubation, the plates were
quickly transferred onto ice and the cells were washed
with cold PBS for 3 times. Then the cells were incubated
at 0°C in 1 ml of MesNa (0.2 mg/ml) solution for 15 min
to release the biotin remaining on the cell surface. After
rinsed by cold PBS for 3 times, the cells were detached
from the 6-well plates using cell scrapers and cell pellets
were obtained by centrifugation. Then the cells were lysed
through freezing and thawing cycles, and biotinylated
αvβ3 integrin was detected by capture-enzyme linked
immune sorbent assay (capture-ELISA) using microtiter
wells coated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to β3 integrin
(sc-14009, Santa Cruz, USA). The protein contents were
determined by BCA analysis.
