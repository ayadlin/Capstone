Abstract
Both betulinic acid (BA) and mithramycin A (MIT) exhibit potent antitumor activity through distinct
mechanisms of Sp1 inhibition. However, it is unknown whether a combination of these two compounds results
in a synergistic inhibitory effect on pancreatic cancer growth and/or has a therapeutic advantage over
gemcitabine. In xenograft mouse models of human pancreatic cancer, treatment with either BA or MIT alone
showed dose-dependent antitumor activity but led to systemic side effects as measured by overall weight loss.
Treatment with a nontoxic dose of either compound alone had only marginal antitumor effects. Importantly,
combination treatment with nontoxic doses of BA and MIT produced synergistic antitumor activity, including
inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. The treatment combination also produced
less discernible side effects than therapeutic doses of gemcitabine. Moreover, combined treatment of BA and
MIT resulted in drastic inhibition of Sp1 recruitment onto Sp1 and VEGF promoters, leading to transcriptional
inhibition of both Sp1 and VEGF and downregulation of Sp1 and VEGF protein expression. Ectopic overexpression of Sp1 rendered tumor cells resistant to BA, MIT, and the combination of the two. Overall, our
findings argue that Sp1 is an important target of BA and MIT and that their combination can produce an
enhanced therapeutic response in human pancreatic cancer. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5182–93. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is currently the fourth leading cause of
cancer-related deaths worldwide. The median survival duration from diagnosis to death is about 6 months, and the overall
5-year survival rate is less than 5% (1–3). Pancreatic tumor is
highly resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Surgery resection is still the primary choice when it is feasible
(4, 5). A full understanding of the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of the development and progression of pancreatic cancer is crucial for identifying new targets of effective
treatment modalities for this deadly disease (6–19). Previous
studies have shown that Sp1 overexpression plays an important role in regulating the expression of VEGF and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer (11–19). Also, we have shown that
neutralization of VEGF by treatment with bevacizumab (Avastin) leads to feedback activation of Sp1 and subsequent
upregulation of expression of VEGF and other factors, leading
to Avastin resistance, whereas blockade of Sp1 expression and
function sensitizes tumors to Avastin and/or reverses Avastin
resistance (20). The synergistic downregulation of Sp1 by
tolfenamic acid and mithramycin A (MIT) produced significant antitumor activity (21).
Sp1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that is important to
the transcription of many cellular and viral genes containing
GC boxes in their promoters. Although Sp1 has been perceived
to be a basal transcription factor since its discovery, increasing
evidence suggests that it regulates a variety of biological
functions, including cell survival, growth, and differentiation
and tumor development and progression (19, 22–24). Recently
it was reported that Sp1 is essential for the epithelial to
mesenchymal transformation induced by TGF-b in pancreatic
cancer cells (25). The epithelial to mesenchymal transformation plays an important role in pancreatic cancer resistance to
chemotherapy and other tumor types (26, 27).

Targeted Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer

A recent study has shown that betulinic acid (BA) inhibits
prostate cancer growth through inhibition of specificity protein
transcription factors (28). BA is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene that exhibits potent antitumor properties.
This anticancer activity has been linked to its ability to directly
trigger mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. In contrast
to the potent cytotoxicity of BA against a variety of cancer
types, nonneoplastic cells and normal tissue remain relatively
resistant to BA, thus pointing to a therapeutic window. Because
agents that exert a direct action on mitochondria may bypass
resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics, there is increasing interest to develop such compounds as experimental
cancer therapeutics. Thus, mitochondrion-targeted agents
such as BA hold great promise as a novel approach to overcome
certain forms of drug resistance in human cancers (29–31).
Interestingly, MIT inhibits Sp1 activity and has antitumor
activities (32, 33). Its major underlying mechanism of action
includes a reversible interaction with double-stranded DNA
with GC-base specificity and selective regulation of transcription of genes having GC-rich promoter sequences (34–37).
Therefore, MIT and BA seem to have distinct mechanisms
of inhibiting Sp1 activity (20, 28). However, it is unknown
whether Sp1 is a critical target for the observed antitumor
activities of those drugs. Also, it is significant to investigate
whether a combination of these 2 compounds has a synergistic inhibitory effect on Sp1 activity and consequent suppression of pancreatic cancer growth and whether this antitumor
activity has any advantages over gemcitabine. In this study, we
sought to address those issues by using cell cultures and
animal models of pancreatic cancer and also explored their
underlying mechanisms.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents
MIT (1 mg/vial crystal powder; lot 098K4043) was purchased
from Sigma Chemical Co. and diluted in sterile water. BA
(powder; lot S43559) also was purchased from Sigma Chemical
Co. and was mixed with corn oil. In our animal experiments,
MIT (0.05–1.50 mg/kg body weight) was administered via
intraperitoneal injection twice a week or as indicated, BA
(10–40 mg/kg) was administered via oral gavages 3 times a
week, and gemcitabine (Eli Lilly) was administered (75 or
150 mg/kg) intraperitoneally twice a week (10).
Cell lines and culture conditions
The human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines BxPC-3
and PANC-1 were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection. FG human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were
used as reported previously (17). The cell lines were maintained in plastic flasks as adherent monolayers in minimal
essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, and a vitamin
solution (Flow Laboratories).
Animals
Female athymic BALB/c nude mice were purchased from
The Jackson Laboratory. The mice were housed in laminar

www.aacrjournals.org

flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions and
used when they were 8 weeks old. The animals were maintained in facilities approved by the Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International in
accordance with the current regulations and standards of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, and NIH.
Matrigel plug assay
A Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay was carried out essentially as described previously (38). Matrigel (200 mL) containing 2  106 cells was injected subcutaneously into nude mice
(2 injection sites per mouse). The Matrigel plugs were recovered from the mice 8 days after injection and carefully stripped
of host tissues. After photomicrography, the Matrigel plugs
were weighed and homogenized in 1 mL of distilled water and
then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatants were collected for hemoglobin concentration measurement by using Drabkin solution (Sigma Chemical Co.) and
a Microplate Manager ELISA reader at 540 nm according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The relative hemoglobin
concentrations were calculated and further normalized
according to the weights of the plugs.
Tumor cell invasion/migration assay
BxPC-3, FG, or PANC-1 cells were pretreated for 12 hours
with 2.5 to 10 mmol/L of BA or dimethyl sulfoxide (ctrl). Cells
from each group were trypsinized, and 2  104 to 5  104 cells
of each group were resuspended and seeded in the upper part
of modified Boyden chambers with Matrigel-coated membrane. Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% FBS
was used as chemoattractant. For each cell line, 750 mL of
respective conditioned media was added into the lower
chamber. After 24 to 48 hours incubation, invasive cells which
had moved through the Matrigel membrane were stained,
counted, and photographed under a microscope (200
magnification).
Gene expression analyses
For Western blot, whole-cell lysates were prepared from
human pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor tissue specimens (17). Standard Western blotting was carried out using
polyclonal rabbit antibodies against human Sp1, VEGF, survivin, uPAR, and Ki67 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an antirabbit IgG antibody, which was a horseradish peroxidase–
linked F(ab0 )2 fragment obtained from a donkey (Amersham).
Equal protein specimen loading was monitored by probing the
same membrane filter with an antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; ref. 17). The probe
proteins were detected by using the Amersham enhanced
chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's
instructions. For quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), total RNA
was reversely transcribed into cDNA by using the iScript cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The cDNA products
were used in qPCR analyses of gene expression by using
PCR primer and probe sets custom-designed or purchased
from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad) and relative RNA expression calculations were done by using a commercially available

and <0.01 were deemed statistically significant (*) and highly
significant (#), respectively.

Immunohistochemical analysis and quantification of
tumor microvessel density
Tissue sections were prepared and processed for immunostaining by using specific antibodies against CD31, Sp1,
and VEGF and appropriate secondary antibodies. The
levels of gene expression and quantification of tumor
microvessel density (MVD) were evaluated as described
previously (20).

Results

Sp1 and VEGF promoter constructs and analysis of Sp1
and VEGF promoter activity
The minimal Sp1 and VEGF promoter reporters in pGL3
luciferase constructs were generated and used as described
previously (17, 20). To examine transcriptional regulation of
the Sp1 and VEGF promoters by BA and MIT, PANC-1 cells
were seeded to about 80% confluence in 6-well plates (in
triplicate) and transiently transfected with 0.6 mg of minimal
Sp1 or VEGF reporter plasmids and 12 ng of Renilla reporter
plasmids as indicated in each experiment by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reporter luciferase activity was measured 48 hours
later by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). Promoter
activity was normalized according to the protein concentration as described previously (17, 20).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin was prepared from pancreatic cancer cells as
described previously (20). A chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assay was carried out by using a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay Kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, DNA cross-binding proteins
were cross-linked with DNA and lysed in SDS lysis buffer. The
lysate was sonicated to shear DNA to 200 to 500 bp. After
preclearing with a salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose 50%
slurry for 30 minutes at 4 C, chromatin specimens were
immunoprecipitated overnight with no antibody or an antiSp1 antibody (PEP2). The region from 224 to 53 bp of the
Sp1 promoter was amplified by using the following primers:
sense, 50 -caggcacgcaacttagtc-30 ; antisense, 50 -gtaaggaggagggagcag-30 . The region from 272 to þ18 bp of the VEGF
promoter was amplified by using the following primers: sense,
50 -ccgcgggcgcgtgtctctgg-30 ; antisense, 50 -tgccccaagcctccgcgatcctc-30 . PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose
gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under
ultraviolet light.
Statistical analysis
All in vivo experiments used 5 mice per group and were
repeated at least once with similar results; 1 representative
experiment was presented. The in vitro cytotoxicity experiments have been carried out in triplicate for each and every
time points and concentrations. The significance of the in vitro
data was determined by using the Student's t test (2-tailed),
whereas the significance of the in vivo data was determined by
using the 2-tailed Mann–Whitney U test. The values of P  0.05

Antitumor effects of BA and MIT in xenograft mouse
models of human pancreatic cancer
Previous studies have shown that Sp1 activity is essential for
VEGF expression and that VEGF plays a major role in pancreatic tumor angiogenesis (17, 39, 40). Treatment with both
BA and MIT can downregulate Sp1, VEGF, and VEGF receptor
expression (28, 41). However, whether these 2 drugs interact
synergistically in regulating Sp1 activity and pancreatic tumor
growth is unknown. In our previous studies, we have already
shown a dose-dependent antitumor activity of MIT (21). In
this first set of experiments, we treated FG and PANC-1
xenograft tumors in nude mice with different doses of BA 3
times a week. BA produced dose-dependent antitumor activities in both FG and PANC-1 models, whereas the body
weights of mice decreased in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 1A and B).
Next, we treated FG and PANC-1 xenograft tumors in nude
mice with nontoxic doses of MIT (0.05 mg/kg), BA (10 mg/kg),
or both. We found that BA and MIT alone had marginal
antitumor activity. In contrast, the combination of MIT and
BA had significant antitumor activity in both FG and PANC-1
models. Furthermore, treatment with low doses of BA and
MIT produced synergistic antitumor activity without any
significant systemic side effects as indicated by a lack of
significant weight loss (Fig. 1C and D). Similar results were
obtained in orthotopic models (Fig. 1E and F). Therefore,
combination administration of low doses of MIT and BA has a
significant therapeutic benefit for pancreatic cancer. This
notion was further confirmed by using both ectopic and
orthotopic models of FG (Supplementary Fig. S1) and
PANC-1 (Supplementary Fig. S2) cells. Specifically, we found
that the doses of gemcitabine that produced significant antitumor activities also led to more discernible losses of animal
body weights than the combination of BA and MIT.
Synergistic cytotoxicity of BA and MIT in human
pancreatic cell lines in vitro
To assess the direct cytotoxicity of BA and MIT, we treated
various pancreatic cancer cell lines with BA for 48 hours
(Fig. 2A); and BxPC-3, FG, and PANC-1 cells with BA for 12,
24, or 48 hours (Fig. 2B). Inhibition of cell proliferation was
assessed by using an MTT assay. We found that BA produced
concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and FG cells exhibited
the highest sensitivity to BA-mediated cytotoxicity. FG cells
were then treated with different concentrations of BA or MIT.
Both drugs exhibited concentration-dependent cytotoxicity
(Fig. 2C). We then optimized the drug concentrations so that
neither agent alone had an extensive cytotoxic effect. Under
this condition, the combination of BA and MIT had substantial cytotoxic effects (Fig. 2D). The combination treatment
with BA and MIT revealed a synergistic effect of cytotoxicity
(data not shown). Similar results were obtained from using
PANC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Western blot analysis, we then used an endothelial cell tube
formation assay to determine the angiogenic potential of the
supernatants of the FG cells. We assessed the degree of tube
formation as the percentage of cell surface area versus the

total surface area. We obtained representative photomicrographs of tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial
cells in the supernatants in situ (Fig. 4A). Treatment with MIT
and/or BA reduced the capacity of supernatants of the FG cells
to stimulate tube formation by endothelial cells compared
with that of supernatants of control FG cells (Fig. 4B).
We confirmed this impaired angiogenic potential by using
an in vivo Matrigel plug assay (Fig. 4C). Our data suggested
that treatment with MIT and/or BA impaired the angiogenic
potential of FG cells.

Effects of treatment with BA and MIT on Sp1 and VEGF
expression and MVD in vivo
To determine the molecular basis for the antitumor effect of
treatment of pancreatic cancer with BA, we carried out
immunohistochemical staining on tissue sections harvested
from FG tumors in Figure 1A. Treatment with BA decreased
expression of Sp1 and its downstream molecules in FG tumors
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). Also, as indicated by
CD31 staining, tumor MVDs were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4E). The immunostaining results were
further confirmed by using Western blot analysis (Fig. 4F).
To determine the molecular basis for the synergistic effect
of treatment of pancreatic cancer with BA and MIT, we carried
out Western blot analysis by using total protein lysates
extracted from the FG tumor specimens collected from mice

MIT as shown in Figure 1C. As shown in Figure 4G, expression
of Sp1 and its downstream targets were downregulated by
treatment with the combination of BA and MIT (Supplementary Fig. S5). Similar results were obtained from using PANC-1

direct inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.

Figure 5. Treatment with BA and MIT downregulates Sp1 expression in vitro. A, FG cells were incubated in a medium alone or a medium containing
different concentrations of BA and/or MIT for 24 hours. Total protein lysates were harvested from the cell cultures, and the level of Sp1 and VEGF
protein expression was determined by using Western blot analysis. Equal protein specimen loading was monitored by probing the same membrane
filter with an anti-GAPDH antibody and changes in gene expression levels were quantitated (A). Total RNA was harvested for qRT-PCR analysis of both Sp1
and VEGF mRNA (B). Sp1 (C) and VEGF (D) promoter reporter constructs were transfected into PANC-1 cells in triplicate and incubated for 12 hours.
The cells were then incubated for another 24 hours in a medium alone or a medium containing 2.5 mmol/L BA, 0.01 mmol/L MIT, or both. Total protein lysates
were harvested from the cell cultures for measurement of Sp1 promoter activity by using a luciferase assay kit. The relative Sp1 promoter activities in treated
groups were expressed as the fold changes from that in their respective control groups. FG (E and F) and PANC-1 (G and H) cells were incubated in vitro in a
medium alone or a medium containing 2.5 mmol/L BA, 0.01 mmol/L MIT, or both for 24 hours and chromatin was extracted from the cells. The ChIP assay was
carried out by using a specific anti-Sp1 antibody and oligonucleotides flanking the VEGF and Sp1 promoter regions containing Sp1-binding sites. The

treatment with BA or MIT at the given dose resulted in low
levels of suppression of Sp1 and VEGF promoter activity,
whereas treatment with the combination of BA and MIT
significantly suppressed this activity. However, further
deletion of Sp1-binding sites eliminated the ability of MIT
to suppress Sp1 (Fig. 5C) and VEGF promoter activity
(Fig. 5D).
Finally, we carried out a ChIP assay by using chromatin
extracted from FG and PANC-1 cells. Treatment with BA or
MIT at the given dose had a minor effect on inhibition of Sp1
recruitment to its own promoter and the VEGF promoter,
whereas treatment with BA combined with MIT at the same
dose significantly decreased Sp1 recruitment to these 2 promoters in both FG (Fig. 5E and F) and PANC-1 cells (Fig. 5G
and H). These results suggested that treatment with BA and
MIT at low doses resulted in insignificant transcriptional
suppression of Sp1 and VEGF mRNA transcription activated
by Sp1, whereas treatment with BA combined with MIT at the
same doses produced synergistic transcriptional suppression
of Sp1 and VEGF transcription.
Overexpression of Sp1 renders pancreatic cancer cells
resistance to BA cytotoxicity
To determine whether Sp1 is a key target of BA, we
evaluated the effects of ectopic Sp1 overexpression on BAmediated cytotoxicity in both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells. The
ectopic Sp1 protein expression was determined by Western
blot by using anti-HA antibody (for exogenous Sp1 protein)
and anti-Sp1 antibody (for total Sp1 protein; Fig. 6A). Clearly,
the ectopic Sp1 overexpression led to resistance to BA in both
BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells (Fig. 6B) and also to the combination
of BA and MIT (Fig. 6C).
BA inhibited the growth of gemcitabine-resistant FG cells
In the last set of experiments, we determined whether
pancreatic cancer cells cross-resist to both BA and gemcitabine. FG, BxPC-3, and PANC-1 cells were treated with gemcitabine (0–1,000 nmol/L) and cytotoxicity was determined by
MTT assay. We found the sensitivities to gemcitabine (Fig. 6D)
were correlated with that to BA among the 3 cell lines (Fig. 2A).
We then established a gemcitabine-resistant FG cell line (FGGR) by incubating the FG cells with increasing concentrations
of gemcitabine for a period of 3 months. As shown in Figure 6E
and F, FG cells were highly sensitive to gemcitabine as
compared with FG-GR cells, whereas both FG and FG-GR
cells remain similarly sensitive to BA or with the combination
of lower levels of both BA and MIT.

Discussion
BA and its derivatives have significant antitumor activities to
various tumor types (28, 31, 42). Of particular interest is its
direct and relatively selective cytotoxic effect on various tumor
cells versus normal or nonneoplastic cells (42). Our current
study showed that an increasing level of antitumor activities
seem to be accompanied by increasing systemic side effects as
reflected by an increasing loss of body weight. Interestingly, FG
and PANC-1 tumor cells exhibited quite different sensitivities

5190

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

to BA-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro, whereas we observed very
similar in vivo antitumor activities in the animal models at
similar doses of BA. These results suggested that the mechanisms for its antitumor activities might not solely because of
direct cytotoxic effects of BA. Therefore, exploration of other
mechanisms underlying its antitumor activities should help
enhance therapeutic index of BA-based cancer therapy, that is,
increased tumor suppression and decreased systemic side
effects. Indeed, BA has significant antiangiogenesis and antiinvasion activities other than antiproliferation activity. More
importantly, a combination of BA and MIT has a synergistic
antitumor activity and exhibit less discernible side effect than
gemcitabine does, and Sp1 is an important target.
Sp1/VEGF pathway is important to pancreatic tumor angiogenesis and its targeted inhibition suppresses pancreatic
tumor growth in mouse models (17, 20, 23, 43). We have shown
that MIT could downregulate Sp1 expression through direct
interference of Sp1 auto upregulation (21, 32). However, as the
important regulator of VEGF, Sp1 protein is of high stability
and abundance, which prevent MIT from rapidly downregulating Sp1 protein level in pancreatic cancer cells. A relative long
treatment time and high dosage of MIT are required to downregulate Sp1 protein, thus increasing the possibility of systemic
side effects (21). Interestingly, recent studies have indicated
that BA and its derivatives promote the degradation of Sp1
proteins (28, 44). In this study, we showed that BA promoted
Sp1 protein downregulation, which is consistent with a previous finding (28). More importantly, combined treatment with
MIT and BA, neither of which has significant effects on Sp1
protein level, substantially downregulated Sp1 protein expression and suppressed angiogenesis, which was consistent with
the synergistic antitumor effect in our mouse models.
Significantly, we have shown that BA has a strong inhibitory
effect on pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion. This
effect might not be simply because of its cytotoxicity, because
BA at nontoxic concentrations suppressed tumor cell invasion. Furthermore, BA sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to
MIT treatment. One of the potential underlying mechanisms
seems to be a rapid downregulation of Sp1 protein expression.
This notion is further supported by our findings, showing
that BA produced dose-dependent suppression of uPAR
in vitro and xenograft tumors. The uPA and uPAR are known
downstream target genes of Sp1 and play an important role in
adhesion, migration, and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells
(45). Given that uncontrolled growth and extensive invasion
and metastasis are hallmarks of pancreatic cancer (46), our
results suggest a novel and significant mechanism underlying
the antitumor activities of BA and its derivatives. Besides uPA
and uPAR, other potential targets of BA treatment warrant
further investigation.
BA produces antitumor activity in combination with other
chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation therapy (47). For example, BA sensitizes drug-resistant colon cancer cells and
esophageal squamous carcinoma cells to 5-fluorouracil,
irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (31, 48). Although the underlying
mechanisms remain to be determined, prior studies have
indicated that BA induces apoptosis through intrinsic pathway independent of p53 and the Fas–FasL extrinsic pathway

(29, 49, 50). Other possible targets for BA antitumor activity
include aminopeptidase N or topoisomerase, suggesting BA
produces broad anticancer effects and sensitizes others chemotherapy and radiotherapy through different molecular targets. In contrast, MIT induces apoptosis at least in part by
stimulating the expression of apoptosis-inducing ligand, Fas
ligand, and TNF-a in tumor cells and by preventing p53mediated transcriptional activation (36, 37). Therefore, MIT
and BA have distinct mechanisms to induce apoptosis, which
might be the underlying basis for their synergistic antitumor
activity. However, our current study also suggested an additional mechanism for apoptosis induction by both MIT and BA.
It was reported that BA-based treatment activates Sp protein
degradation and inhibits its downstream target survivin
expression in cancer cells, which plays an important role in
tumor cell resistance to apoptosis (28). Our results showed that
BA inhibits tumor cell growth in vitro and that this effect is
synergistic with that of MIT. Consistently, BA and MIT synergistically downregulated Sp1 and survivin protein expression.
Likewise, a synergistic downregulation of Sp1 may also cause
downregulation of VEGF and uPAR, hence suppression of
pancreatic cancer angiogenesis and invasion. Therefore, it is
likely that an accelerated downregulation of Sp1 and its major
target genes including VEGF, survivin, and uPAR be an important mechanism for antitumor activities of BA and its derivatives. Finally, ectopic overexpression of Sp1 rendered tumor
cells resistance to BA, MIT, and their combination, strongly
suggested that Sp1 is crucial for the antitumor activities
observed.
In summary, we investigated the antitumor activity of
natural product BA and its underlying mechanisms of actions
in pancreatic cancer models. Besides its expected antiproliferation activity, BA exhibited strong antiangiogenesis and
antiinvasion abilities in pancreatic cancer. Our experimental
results further indicated that Sp1 was one of the important

targets for BA-mediated protein degradation and MITmediated transcriptional repression. Furthermore, our findings that a combination of BA and MIT at low doses effectively
downregulated the expression of Sp1 and its downstream
targets including VEGF, uPAR, and survivin and produced
synergistic antitumor effects with an enhanced therapeutic
index strongly suggested that a combined use of drugs having
distinct mechanisms of action could potentially benefit cancer
patients. Given that the combination of BA and MIT, and their
combinations with gemcitabine, seem to be less toxic than
gemcitabine alone, the treatment with such combinations in
clinical studies is a rational step forward in the development of
effective targeted therapies for pancreatic cancer and other
cancers. Further investigations into the mechanisms for
enhanced therapeutic index of such combinations are clearly
warranted.
