βIII-Tubulin Is a Multifunctional Protein Involved in Drug
Sensitivity and Tumorigenesis in Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer
Joshua A. McCarroll, Pei Pei Gan, Marjorie Liu, and Maria Kavallaris

Abstract
Advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a dismal prognosis. βIII-Tubulin, a protein highly
expressed in neuronal cells, is strongly associated with drug-refractory and aggressive NSCLC. To date, the
role of this protein in in vivo drug resistance and tumorigenesis has not been determined. NSCLC cells stably
expressing βIII-tubulin short hairpin RNA displayed reduced growth and increased chemotherapy sensitivity
when compared with control clones. In concordance with these results, stable suppression of βIII-tubulin
reduced the incidence and significantly delayed the growth of tumors in mice relative to controls. Our findings
indicate that βIII-tubulin mediates not only drug sensitivity but also the incidence and progression of lung
cancer. βIII-Tubulin is a cellular survival factor that, when suppressed, sensitizes cells to chemotherapy via
enhanced apoptosis induction and decreased tumorigenesis. Findings establish that upregulation of a neuronal tubulin isotype is a key contributor to tumor progression and drug sensitivity in lung adenocarcinoma.

Introduction
Advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a
dismal prognosis and remains the most common cause of
cancer-related death worldwide. Mechanisms mediating
resistance and tumor aggressiveness are poorly defined.
βIII-Tubulin, a microtubule protein highly expressed in neuronal cells, is strongly associated with drug-refractory and
aggressive NSCLC (1). Microtubules are multifunctional cytoskeletal proteins involved in many essential cellular roles, including maintenance of cell shape, intracellular transport,
and in mitosis, forming mitotic spindles to ensure proper
chromosome segregation and cell division. The soluble
α/β-tubulin heterodimers assemble to form the microtubule
polymer, with the soluble and polymer forms coexisting
in a state of dynamic equilibrium (2). A number of α- and
β-tubulin isotypes have been identified that display differential developmental and tissue expression and differ in their
chromosomal localization (2). It is increasingly apparent that
the cellular role of microtubules extends beyond structural
support into key signaling and apoptotic roles.
β-Tubulin is the cellular target of clinically important
tubulin-binding agents (TBA) used in cancer therapy. High

expression of βIII-tubulin was associated with resistance in
paclitaxel-selected NSCLC cells and clinical resistance to paclitaxel in ovarian cancer (3). Translational studies have now
clearly established that expression of βIII-tubulin is associated with resistance to taxanes or vinorelbine in a range of
tumor types, including lung, ovarian, breast, gastric, and
cancers of unknown origin (reviewed in refs. 1, 4). To date,
resistance mediated by βIII-tubulin was thought to be
restricted to TBAs. However, we recently identified a broader
role for βIII-tubulin in NSCLC (5). βIII-Tubulin can mediate
response in vitro not only to broad classes of TBAs but also to
DNA-damaging agents. This broad chemosensitization is specific to βIII-tubulin, as silencing of βII- or βIVb-tubulin does
not sensitize NSCLC cells to paclitaxel (6). In addition, βIIItubulin under stress conditions has been found to be a
mediator of cell survival (7). Indeed, it has been known for
some time that tumors expressing βIII-tubulin have a poorer
clinical outcome than tumors that have low or no expression
of this tubulin isotype (reviewed in refs. 1, 8). In lung and
a number of other cancers, increased expression of βIIItubulin is associated with poorly differentiated tumor tissue,
high-grade malignancy, and metastatic potential (8, 9). A recent study found that completely resectable NSCLC tumors,
with high expression of βIII-tubulin, correlated with resistance to docetaxel. Collectively, the laboratory and clinical
data strongly suggest that βIII-tubulin may have a broader
role in the tumorigenesis of certain cancers, such as NSCLC
(10). Major issues that have yet to be resolved include the
role of βIII-tubulin in mediating in vivo drug sensitivity
and whether βIII-tubulin is functionally involved in the
tumorigenic phenotype of epithelial cancers.
Herein, we show that βIII-tubulin is mediating in vitro
and in vivo drug sensitivity. Importantly, suppression of
βIII-tubulin expression reduces anchorage-independent
growth and leads to decreased incidence and progression

of NSCLC cell xenografts, directly implicating this protein in
the tumorigenic phenotype of NSCLC.

Materials and Methods
Generation of βIII-tubulin stable short hairpin
RNA–expressing cells
The human NSCLC cell line H460 was maintained as previously described (5). For the generation of βIII-tubulin stable
knockdown cells, H460 cells were transfected with the pRS
vector containing the βIII-tubulin short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
expression cassette (pRS/βIIISH) and the pRS vector containing a noneffective shRNA cassette against green fluorescent
protein that acts as a negative control (pRS/CtrlSH; OriGene
Technologies, Inc.). The 29-mer shRNA sequence that targets
βIII-tubulin is as follows: 5′-GTGTGAGCTGCTCCTGT‐
CTCTGTCTTATT-3′. Cells were selected in growth media
containing puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) to enrich the population of cells that had retained the expression plasmid.
Approximately 6 to 60 individual clonal populations were
isolated for each construct. After clonal expansion, each clone
was examined for βIII-tubulin expression by Western blotting
as described below.
Gene expression of βIII-tubulin by real-time PCR
The expression of βIII-tubulin in stably expressing shRNA
cells was examined using real-time quantitative PCR. Total
RNA was extracted and DNase treated using the Qiagen
RNeasy Plus kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Real-time PCR was done using the QuantiTect SYBR Green
PCR kit (Qiagen). βIII-Tubulin mRNA sequences used were
as follows: forward, 5′-GCGAGATGTACGAAGACGAC-3′;
reverse, 5′-TTTAGACACTGCTGGCTTCG-3′. All data were
normalized to the housekeeping gene β 2 -microglobulin
(β2-Microglobulin QuantiTect Primer Assay, Qiagen).
Western blotting of tubulin isotypes
Western blot analyses using the following antibodies
were performed as described previously (5): βIII-tubulin
(clone TUJ1; Chemicon), βI-tubulin (clone SAP 4G5; Abcam
Ltd.), βII-tubulin (clone 7B9; Chemicon), βIV-tubulin (clone
ONS. 1A6; Sigma), total tubulin (clone TUB 2.1; Abcam), and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; clone
6C5; Abcam).
Assessment of drug sensitivity in vitro
Drug-treated clonogenic assays using CDDP or paclitaxel
were performed as described previously (5).
Assessment of drug sensitivity in vivo
BALB/c nude mice (6–8 wk old) were obtained from the
Animal Resource Center at the University of New South
Wales (Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions for the
studies. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee, University of New South Wales
(ACEC#: 07/89B). Stably expressing βIII-tubulin shRNA
(pRS/βIIISH4 or pRS/βIIISH59) or control (pRS/CtrlSH1 and

pRS/CtrlSH2) cells (1 × 106) were inoculated s.c. Once tumors reached approximately 200 to 300 mm3, mice were
randomized into treatment groups (five mice per treatment group) and treated with 3.33 mg/kg CDDP (one injection once a day for 3 d) or its vehicle control (PBS).
Mice were then closely monitored and tumors were measured twice weekly. Tumor volume was calculated using
the formula (a × b × c)/2, where a and b are the shorter
and longer diameter, respectively, of the tumors and c is
the depth. All mice were sacrificed once tumors reached
1,000 mm3 or if they lost ≥20% body weight. At the time
of sacrifice, tumor tissue was collected and placed into 4%
paraformaldehyde for histologic analysis or snap frozen in
liquid N2 for biochemical analysis.
Rescue of βIII-tubulin expression in shRNA-expressing
NSCLC cells
Full-length Hβ4 was amplified from a L1110, pMOSBlue vector construct (Amersham Biosciences) containing Hβ4 cDNA,
with the following primers: forward, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG; reverse, 5′-ATTCATTCGCGGCCGCCACC. PCR amplification was performed using the FailSafe PCR System
(Epicentre Biotechnologies). The amplified product was subcloned into the episomal expression vector, pREP4 (Invitrogen),
following digestion with HindIII and NotI restriction enzymes
(Promega). This resulted in the introduction of an additional
methionine start site that was subsequently removed by amplifying the construct with the following primers: forward, 5′-TCATAAGCTTATGCGGGAGATCGTGC; reverse, 5′-TGCCTCT‐
CGCGGCCGCTGCGAGCAGC. The amplified product was then
subcloned into pREP4 again following digestion with HindIII
and NotI to generate the plasmid pREP4/βIII. For isolation of
stable rescue clones, two independent stable βIII-tubulin
shRNA clones (pRS/βIIISH4 or pRS/βIIISH59) were transfected
with the pREP4/βIII vector (pRS/βIIISH4/pREPR6, pRS/βIIISH4/
pREPR17, pRS/βIIISH59/pREPR33, and pRS/βIIISH59/pREPR37) or
the empty pREP4 vector (pRS/βIIISH4/pREPEV1 and pRS/βIIISH4/pREPEV2) as a control. Cells were then selected in media
containing hygromycin B (Calbiochem). Individual colonies
were isolated and expanded. The resultant cells were assessed
for βIII-tubulin by Western blotting as described above.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was carried out to measure the expression of βIII-tubulin and Ki67 in paraffin-embedded subcutaneous tumor tissue using a βIII-tubulin monoclonal rabbit
antibody (clone TUJ1 1-15-79; Covance) and a mouse monoclonal Ki67 antibody (clone MIB-1; Dako). 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine
was used as a substrate for the peroxidase reaction and hematoxylin as the counterstain. The specificity of the primary antibodies was confirmed by including several negative controls:
(a) omission of the primary antibody and (b) incubating sections with normal goat IgG (Vector Laboratories) at the same
concentration as the primary antibody.
In vitro tumorigenesis assay

pRS/Ctrl SH2 ) shRNA were resuspended in 0.33% agar in
growth media and plated on 0.5% solidified agar (bottom
supportive layer). Triplicate plates were set up for each
sample. After 12 days of culture, individual colonies were
counted and photographed using the Zeiss Axiovert S100
inverted microscope and SPOT digital camera. The results
were expressed as the percentage of colony formation, according to the formula: (number of colonies formed/number of cells seeded) × 100%.
In vivo tumorigenesis assay
BALB/c nude mice (6–8 wk old) were inoculated s.c.
with cells stably expressing βIII-tubulin (pRS/βIIISH4 or
pRS/βIIISH59 ) or control (pRS/Ctrl SH1 and pRS/CtrlSH2 )
shRNA (1 × 106) cells (10 mice per group). Tumors were
measured twice weekly using digital calipers, and tumor
volume was calculated using the formula (a × b × c)/2, where
a and b are the shorter and longer diameter, respectively, of
the tumors and c is the depth. All mice were sacrificed once
tumors reached 1,000 mm3 or if mice had lost ≥20% body
weight. At the time of sacrifice, tumors were divided into sections and placed into 4% paraformaldehyde for histologic
analysis or snap frozen in liquid N2 for biochemical analysis.

(siRNA) significantly sensitized NSCLC cells to both TBAs
and DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin (CDDP; ref.
5). To confirm that stable βIII-tubulin shRNA-expressing
NSCLC cells behaved in a similar fashion, we assessed their
sensitivity to CDDP (a platinum-based agent that is often
used as the backbone for systemic chemotherapy in the
treatment of NSCLC). All three βIII-tubulin knockdown
clones (pRS/βIIISH60, pRS/βIIISH59, and pRS/βIIISH4) were
found to exhibit increased sensitivity to CDDP (Fig. 1A).
pRS/βIIISH4, which has the greatest amount of knockdown,
showed the greatest sensitivity to CDDP (mean ID50 value,
0.17 μmol/L). Similarly, pRS/βIIISH60 and pRS/βIIISH59 were
significantly more sensitive to CDDP (mean ID50 values of
0.22 and 0.24 μmol/L, respectively) compared with control
clones (pRS/CtrlSH1 and pRS/CtrlSH2; mean ID50 values of
0.41 and 0.38 μmol/L, respectively). Similar results were
observed when cells were treated with the TBA paclitaxel
or the cisplatin analogue carboplatin (Supplementary Fig.
S3A and B).

Generation of stable βIII-tubulin shRNA-expressing
NSCLC cells
To allow a long-term study of the possible effects of silencing βIII-tubulin expression on in vivo drug sensitivity and the
tumorigenic potential, NSCLC cells were generated, which
stably express the pRS/βIIISH construct (refer to Materials
and Methods). Control cells were transfected with a nonfunctional 29-mer shRNA. Three independent βIII-tubulin–
expressing shRNA clones, designated pRS/βIIISH60, pRS/
βIIISH59, and pRS/βIIISH4, were identified as cells that stably express significantly reduced levels (>80% knockdown)
of βIII-tubulin at both the gene transcript and protein level
when compared with the control clones pRS/CtrlSH1 and
pRS/CtrlSH2 (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Specific stable
knockdown of βIII-tubulin was achieved without compensatory upregulation of other β-tubulin isotypes (Supplementary
Fig. S2). This is not surprising given that βIII-tubulin makes
up ∼7% of the total β-tubulin pool in H460 cells (11).

Rescue of βIII-tubulin abolishes increased sensitivity
to cisplatin
To verify the specificity of reduced levels of βIII-tubulin on
chemosensitivity and to rule out any potential off-target effects of shRNA, we performed rescue experiments. Briefly,
βIII-tubulin shRNA-expressing (pRS/βIIISH4 or pRS/βIIISH59)
cells were transfected with the full-length human cDNA of
the βIII-tubulin gene with expression driven by the episomal
vector pREP4. Cells were also transfected with the empty vector alone as a control. Four independent βIII-tubulin rescue
clones were chosen from the βIII shRNA stably expressing
clones pRS/βIIISH4 and pRS/βIIISH59 and designated as pRS/
βIIISH4/pREPR6, pRS/βIIISH4/pREPR17, pRS/βIIISH59/pREPR33,
and pRS/βIIISH59/pREPR37. All four rescue clones showed restored βIII-tubulin protein to levels similar to controls (pRS/
CtrlSH1 and pRS/CtrlSH2; Fig. 1B). No effect on βIII-tubulin levels was observed for cells stably expressing the empty pREP4
vector (pRS/βIII SH4 /pREP EV1 and pRS/βIII SH4 /pREP EV2 ;
Fig. 1B). Importantly, sensitivity to CDDP was completely restored in all four βIII-tubulin rescue clones (pRS/βIIISH4/
pREP R6 , mean ID 50 = 0.59 μmol/L; pRS/βIII SH4 /pREP R17 ,
mean ID50 = 0.41 μmol/L; pRS/βIIISH59/pREPR33, mean ID50 =
0.41 μmol/L; pRS/βIIISH59/pREPR37, mean ID50 = 0.42 μmol/L)
when compared with cells expressing the empty pREP4 vector (pRS/βIIISH4/pREPEV1, mean ID50 = 0.20 μmol/L; pRS/
βIIISH4/pREPEV2, mean ID50 = 0.16 μmol/L; pRS/βIIISH59/
pREPEV1, mean ID50 = 0.14 μmol/L; pRS/βIIISH59/pREPEV2,
mean ID50 = 0.13 μmol/L). In fact, the ID50 values for the rescue clones were very similar to the control shRNA cells (pRS/
CtrlSH1, mean ID50 = 0.42 μmol/L; pRS/CtrlSH2, mean ID50 =
0.34 μmol/L in Fig. 1A; also refer to Fig. 1C and D). Collectively, these results confirm that reduced levels of βIII-tubulin are
responsible for the increased sensitivity to CDDP in NSCLC.

pathways were investigated. The increase in sensitivity to
CDDP was associated with an enhanced induction of apoptosis in the βIII-tubulin shRNA-expressing cells as evidenced by
a significant increase in Annexin V (a measure of phosphatidylserine externalization) staining (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
In addition, to explore whether the intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic pathways were involved, we measured the activity of
the initiator caspase-8 and caspase-9 after exposure to
CDDP. βIII-Tubulin shRNA-expressing cells and their controls displayed an increase in caspase-9 activity when exposed to 2 and 4 μmol/L CDDP (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
However, there was no significant difference in activity between the βIII-tubulin shRNA-expressing and control
shRNA-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). In contrast, a significant increase in caspase-8 activity was observed
in the βIII-tubulin shRNA-expressing cells when compared
with controls after exposure to CDDP (Supplementary Fig.
S4C). This increase in activity also correlated with a significant increase in the activation of the effector caspase-3/
caspase-7 and cleavage of its substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in the βIII-tubulin shRNA-expressing cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Collectively, these data suggest that
inhibiting βIII-tubulin enhances drug-induced apoptosis via
a caspase-mediated cascade in lung cancer cells.

Inhibition of βIII-tubulin increases sensitivity to
cisplatin in vivo
Having shown that βIII-tubulin suppression increased
in vitro drug sensitivity, we sought to determine whether reduced levels of βIII-tubulin could sensitize NSCLC tumors to
CDDP in an in vivo setting. BALB/c nude mice were xenografted with βIII-tubulin (pRS/βIIISH4 or pRS/βIIISH59) or
control (pRS/CtrlSH1 and pRS/CtrlSH2) shRNA-expressing
NSCLC cells. Once tumors reached approximately 200 to
300 mm3, mice were treated with CDDP or its vehicle. Mice
injected with βIII-tubulin shRNA-expressing cells (pRS/
βIIISH4 or pRS/βIIISH59) displayed a significant delay in tumor growth (time to reach 1,000 mm3) and increased median
survival after treatment with CDDP when compared with
control shRNA-expressing (pRS/CtrlSH1 and pRS/CtrlSH2) tumors [pRS/Ctrl SH1 (vehicle, PBS) = 15.6 d; pRS/Ctrl SH1
(CDDP) = 13 d; pRS/CtrlSH2 (vehicle, PBS) = 7.2 d; pRS/CtrlSH2
(CDDP) = 10.8 d; pRS/βIIISH4 (vehicle, PBS) = 15.6 d; pRS/
βIIISH4 (CDDP) = 35 d; pRS/βIIISH59 (vehicle, PBS) = 15.6 d;
pRS/βIIISH59 (CDDP) = 29.4 d; Fig. 2A–C]. Taken together,
these results show that the level of βIII-tubulin regulates
drug sensitivity in NSCLC and that suppressing βIII-tubulin
expression confers a survival advantage after chemotherapy
treatment in vivo.

Knockdown of βIII-tubulin decreases anchorageindependent growth in NSCLC cells
The ability of transformed cells to grow under anchorageindependent conditions is one of the hallmark properties
that are associated with the tumorigenic potential of a cancer cell (12). Given that increased levels of βIII-tubulin are
associated with more aggressive disease in NSCLC, we then
proceeded to assess whether βIII-tubulin plays a role in tumorigenicity. βIII-Tubulin knockdown clones (pRS/βIIISH4,
pRS/βIIISH59, and pRS/βIIISH60) were grown in soft agar,
and the number of colonies formed was assessed. Stable
knockdown of βIII-tubulin significantly reduced the number
of colonies formed in all three βIII-tubulin knockdown
clones (pRS/βIII SH4 , mean % colony formation = 15.89;
pRS/βIIISH59, mean % colony formation = 33.39; pRS/βIIISH60,
mean % colony formation = 32.88) when compared with control (pRS/CtrlSH1, mean % colony formation = 58.12; pRS/

CtrlSH2, mean colony % formation = 59.82; Fig. 3A). Similar
results were also observed in cells treated with two different
27-mer dicer siRNA targeting different regions of the βIIItubulin gene as well as conventional siRNA targeting βIIItubulin (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Notably, the effect of
reduced βIII-tubulin on tumorigenicity seemed to be tubulin
isotype specific, as no significant effect was observed when
cells were treated with siRNA targeting another β-tubulin
isotype, βIVb-tubulin (Supplementary Fig. S6B). This suggests that βIII-tubulin may play a novel and specific role in
the tumorigenic potential of NSCLC cells.
Rescue of βIII-tubulin expression restores anchorageindependent growth of NSCLC cells
To verify the specificity of βIII-tubulin in contributing to
tumorigenicity, the βIII-tubulin in the stable knockdown
clones pRS/βIII SH 59 and pRS/βIII SH 4 was rescued as

described above. Restoration of βIII-tubulin effectively rescued the suppression of anchorage-independent growth in
the NSCLC cells (pRS/βIIISH4/pREPR6, mean % colony formation = 48.05; pRS/βIIISH4/pREPR17, mean % colony formation = 45.50; difference = 35.12; Fig. 3B). In contrast, empty
pREP vector clones that maintained reduced βIII-tubulin expression (pRS/βIIISH4/pREPEV1 and pRS/βIIISH4/pREPEV2)
failed to restore the clonogenic growth in soft agar (pRS/βIIISH4/pREPEV1, mean % colony formation = 10.38%; pRS/βIIISH4/pREPEV2, mean % colony formation = 10.33%) compared
with control shRNA clones (pRS/CtrlSH1 and pRS/CtrlSH2;
Fig. 3A). These results provide strong support that the
decrease in anchorage-independent growth is directly
attributable to the reduction of βIII-tubulin expression.

Suppression of βIII-tubulin decreases the incidence
and progression of tumor growth in vivo
To examine whether reduced levels of βIII-tubulin could
influence tumor incidence and growth in vivo, we injected
mice with NSCLC cells stably expressing the βIII-tubulin
shRNA construct (pRS/βIIISH59 and pRS/βIIISH4) or its control (pRS/CtrlSH1 and pRS/CtrlSH2). Tumor development and
growth was recorded over a 12-week period. Mice injected
with control shRNA (pRS/CtrlSH1 and pRS/CtrlSH2) cells had
a 100% (20 of 20) tumor incidence. However, only 65% (13 of
20) of mice injected with βIII-tubulin shRNA-expressing
cells (pRS/βIIISH59 and pRS/βIIISH4) formed tumors after
12 weeks (Fig. 4A). To confirm that βIII-tubulin shRNA was
active, βIII-tubulin expression was assessed in tumor tissue.

βIII-Tubulin: Sensitivity and Tumorigenesis in NSCLC

Importantly, βIII-tubulin mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in βIII-tubulin shRNA-expressing tumors
(pRS/βIIISH59 and pRS/βIIISH4) when compared with control
(pRS/CtrlSH1 and pRS/CtrlSH2; Fig. 4B and C). The decrease in
βIII-tubulin expression in tumor tissue was also confirmed
by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4D and E). Moreover, tumors
expressing βIII-tubulin shRNA showed a significant delay in
tumor growth (βIII-tubulin shRNA, 67.8 d versus control
shRNA, 36.15 d) and size when compared with control tumors (Fig. 5A and B). Taken together, these results confirm
that the activity of βIII-tubulin shRNA is highly potent and
active in an in vivo setting. More importantly, these results
clearly show for the first time that βIII-tubulin has an important functional role in tumor development and progression
in NSCLC.

Discussion
βIII-tubulin is predominantly a neuronal-expressed cytoskeletal protein that is associated with drug resistance and
aggressive tumors in a range of cancer types, including
NSCLC, ovarian, and breast cancers (1, 4). Despite strong correlative preclinical and clinical evidence implicating a role
for βIII-tubulin in tumorigenesis, its role in tumor formation
and aggression has not been addressed (1, 13, 14). Herein, we
have identified and validated a new mechanism of action
for βIII-tubulin as a cellular survival factor that, when
suppressed, sensitizes cells to chemotherapy via enhanced
apoptosis induction and decreased tumorigenesis.
Previous studies have attempted to address the role of
βIII-tubulin in drug resistance by overexpressing βIII-tubulin
(15, 16). However, the results have been difficult to interpret
due to increased cell toxicity and significant compensatory
changes in the levels of other β-tubulin isotypes. In this
study, we overcame a number of these challenges by using
a RNA interference approach and examined the effects of stable knockdown of βIII-tubulin on drug sensitivity. Consistent
with transient knockdown of βIII-tubulin in two independent NSCLC cell lines (5), stable knockdown of βIII-tubulin

resulted in increased in vitro sensitivity to cisplatin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel. Enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin in the
βIII-tubulin knockdown cells was correlated with a significant induction of drug-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by
an increase in Annexin V staining as well as increased activity of the initiator caspase-8 and the downstream effector
caspase-3/caspase-7 and its substrate PARP, suggesting that
suppressing βIII-tubulin levels in NSCLC may increase cell
death on exposure to chemotherapy by modulating caspase
activity. Importantly, confirmation that suppression of βIIItubulin was directly responsible for the enhanced sensitivity
to CDDP and not off-target effects of shRNA was obtained
when βIII-tubulin levels were “rescued” back into the cells.
Given the strong clinical evidence linking high βIII-tubulin
levels and drug resistance, our finding that stable suppression of βIII-tubulin expression increases in vivo sensitivity
to CDDP has direct clinical relevance. Taken together with
the in vitro data showing increased susceptibility to druginduced apoptosis in βIII-tubulin knockdown cells, βIIItubulin seems to be mechanistically involved as a survival
factor, which helps protect cancer cells from cell death by
chemotherapy drugs. In support, a recent study in ovarian
cancer cells exposed to the stress condition hypoxia showed
that βIII-tubulin expression was significantly increased (17)
and hypoxia-induced βIII-tubulin expression correlated with
paclitaxel resistance (18). In our model, we cannot exclude
the possibility that βIII-tubulin may be induced under hypoxic conditions, as the potent stable knockdown would mask
any effects. Of note is that a number of signaling proteins
involved in regulating drug resistance coimmunoprecipitate
or colocalize with βIII-tubulin (17, 19). Therefore, it is feasible that silencing βIII-tubulin expression in cancer cells disrupts important protein interactions and signaling processes,
which are vital for providing cancer cells with a survival
advantage when exposed to cytotoxic stressors.
High levels of βIII-tubulin in clinical samples are correlated strongly with a poorly differentiated and invasive tumor
phenotype in a number of epithelial-derived cancers, including NSCLC. βIII-Tubulin expression was positively correlated

with decreased overall survival in ovarian and NSCLC patients regardless of response to chemotherapy, suggesting
that βIII-tubulin may contribute to the aggressive behavior
of a tumor rather than only a marker of chemotherapy resistance (1, 20). However, despite strong correlative evidence
implicating βIII-tubulin in tumorigenesis, its role in tumor
incidence and development has been lacking. This study provides the first evidence that βIII-tubulin levels directly influence anchorage-independent growth (a measure of
tumorigenic potential). This raises an important question:
Is this phenotype specific to suppression of βIII-tubulin or
would another β-tubulin isotype mediate a similar effect?
The phenotype seems to be specific to βIII-tubulin, as no effect was observed in cells treated with siRNA targeting another β-tubulin isotype, βIVb-tubulin (Supplementary Fig.
S6B). However, it cannot be ruled out that other β-tubulin
isotypes may also affect tumorigenicity. We also addressed
the possibility that the βIII-tubulin shRNA was mediating
“off-target” effects. However, rescue of βIII-tubulin restored
anchorage-independent growth to control levels, again
confirming that the observed effect was a direct result of
βIII-tubulin knockdown. Strikingly, stable knockdown of
βIII-tubulin significantly delayed tumor growth and reduced
tumor incidence of subcutaneous xenografted tumors. The
reduced growth and incidence of the tumors was not due
to reduced cell proliferation, as stable knockdown of βIIItubulin did not affect cell proliferation in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S7), suggesting that other factors associated with
βIII-tubulin were at play. In the tumor environment, cancer
cells survive under stressful conditions, and our finding that
βIII-tubulin is a cellular survival factor for drug-induced cell
death may extend to other known cellular stressors, including hypoxia and cytokine exposure (21). Consequently, there
may be a balance between cell proliferation and cell death
during tumor growth in our model. Alternatively, in the tumor microenvironment, the βIII-tubulin knockdown cells are
proliferating at a slower rate. We support the former possibility as, once the tumors reached 1 cm3, staining with a proliferation marker (Ki67) did not reveal any difference in
tumor cell proliferation in βIII-tubulin knockdown cells
(Supplementary Fig. S8). Further investigation of cell proliferation and cell death parameters is under way to identify
the cellular events mediated by βIII-tubulin during the early
stages of in vivo tumor growth. The ability of βIII-tubulin
knockdown to markedly suppress tumor progression strongly

suggests an important role for this protein in lung cancer
growth.
Our finding that βIII-tubulin is associated with tumorigenesis is not without precedent for a microtubule-related protein. For example, the microtubule-destabilizing protein
stathmin has been linked with tumorigenesis in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (22–24). Moreover, a mutation in stathmin identified in esophageal adenocarcinoma
was found to play a role in tumorigenesis (25). Despite the
fact that βIII-tubulin is present in relatively small amounts
in the NSCLC H460 cells (7.8% of total β-tubulin isotypes;
ref. 11), knockdown of this minor isotype produces marked
effects in drug response and tumorigenesis, suggesting that
βIII-tubulin is functionally important in NSCLC cells. Our
data strongly support a mechanistic role for βIII-tubulin in
tumor cell behavior.
This study has shown that βIII-tubulin is a multifunctional
protein that has a key role in the pathobiology and aggressiveness of human lung cancer by influencing drug sensitivity, tumor incidence, and progression. Our findings have
direct clinical relevance and raise the possibility that future
therapeutic strategies aimed at specifically blocking βIIItubulin activity may have the dual advantage of suppressing
lung cancer growth while enhancing the chemosensitivity of
the tumor cells.
