BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to independently evaluate the objective response rate of sorafenib
and sorafenib plus low-dose interferon-alfa 2b (IFN) as frontline therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). METHODS: Untreated patients with clear cell mRCC were randomized to receive sorafenib 400 mg
orally twice daily or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily plus subcutaneous IFN 0.5 million U (MU) twice daily. Primary endpoints included the objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Secondary endpoints included progressionfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Exploratory endpoints included the predictive value of tumor tissue biomarkers. RESULTS: Eighty patients were enrolled. The median follow-up was 19.7 months (range, 0-34.2 months). The
ORR was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.6%-46.5%) in the sorafenib arm and 25% (95% CI, 12.7%-41.2%) in the
combination arm. The median PFS was 7.39 months in the sorafenib-alone arm (95% CI, 5.52-9.20 months) and 7.56
months in the sorafenib plus IFN arm (95% CI, 5.19-11.07 months). The median OS was 27.04 months in the combination arm (95% CI, from 22.31 to not attained) and was not reached in the sorafenib arm. Toxicities were comparable in
both arms. In a multivariate model, increased phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) levels were associated with
poorer PFS (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08; P ¼ .0411) and OS (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29; P ¼ .0173).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of low-dose IFN to sorafenib resulted in efficacy outcomes that were comparable to
those achieved with sorafenib monotherapy. The current results indicated that pAKT levels may predict for clinical

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) affects >40 000 patients per year in the United States and is responsible for approximately
13,000 deaths.1 Once it becomes metastatic, RCC is difficult to treat, and the median survival is between 1 year and 2
years.2,3 Several treatment modalities have been used to treat metastatic RCC, including immunotherapy,4,5 chemotherapy,6,7 and targeted therapies.3,8,9 Several targeted agents have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with advanced RCC, including sorafenib, sunitinib, and temsirolimus. Although each of
these drugs is active as a single agent, few patients achieve a complete response (CR), virtually all patients experience

disease progression, and long-term survival is rare. These
observations have led to the hypothesis that combining
agents with different mechanisms of action may lead to
improved clinical outcomes.
We explored this concept by combining sorafenib
with low-dose IFN in a randomized phase 2 trial. Sorafenib is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of
wild-type and mutant (the V599E point mutation, which
is a substitution of the amino acid valine for glutamic acid
at codon 599 in the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene
homolog B1 [BRAF]) B-Raf and c-Raf kinase isoforms
and of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2),
VEGFR-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor b, fmsrelated tyrosine kinase 3, and the cytokine receptor c-KIT.
IFN is an immunomodulatory cytokine that is produced
by leukocytes and other immunomodulatory cells, and it
possesses direct cellular antiproliferative effects and
stimulates major histocompatibility complex Class I
expression.10
The rationale for combining an antiangiogenic
agent with IFN is based on 2 principal observations: 1)
Lower doses of IFN have an antiangiogenic effect, which
inhibits growth levels of VEGF and basic fibroblast
growth factor10,11; and 2) this effect also may antagonize
the recognized up-regulation of VEGF by receptor tyrosine kinases.12 It is noteworthy that IFN blocks VEGF
through decreased transcription,12 a mechanism that is
different from targeted therapies (blockade of receptor
activation); thus, cross-resistance would not be predicted
by combining the 2. We chose a dose of 0.5 MU IFN
twice daily because of its potential antiangiogenic activity
and because our recently reported randomized study
revealed no difference in efficacy outcomes between this
dose and 5 MU IFN daily in patients with previously
untreated, metastatic RCC despite producing fewer side
effects and higher quality-of-life measures.13
There is a growing interest in using molecular biomarkers in earlier phase trials to help choose the most
promising investigational agents worthy of further
study. We chose to focus on tissue-based markers of
phoshatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway activation.
The PI3K pathway is involved directly or indirectly in
maintenance of cellular viability,14,15 protein synthesis,16 and cell cycle regulation.17 Emerging data suggest
that the up-regulation of PI3K pathway components is
associated with a poor outcome in patients with
RCC.18,19 Downstream protein kinase B (AKT) effector
molecules are associated with hypoxia-inducible factor

(HIF) regulation,20 providing a direct mechanistic link
to angiogenesis. Differential expression of HIF-1 a
(HIF1a) and HIF2a) appears to generate distinct phenotypes, and the up-regulation of c-Myc has been
observed in HIF2a-predominant tumors.21 In addition,
HIF1a expression depends on raptor, a component of
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1
(mTORC1) complex, and rictor, a component of
mTORC2; whereas HIF2a depends only on mTORC2,
which feeds back and phosphorylates serine 473 (S473)
on AKT.22 Taken together, we hypothesize that S473
activation of AKT is a biomarker of a resistance
phenotype either through c–Myc-dependent pathway
activation or through the up-regulation of alternate
HIF2a-dependent angiogenic pathways.
To detect efficacy signals reliably, randomized trials
are required. Randomized phase 2 studies, although they
are not powered to detect survival differences, can aid in
objectively selecting regimens with a potential differential
impact on patient outcome. Herein, we present data from
the first randomized phase 2 study comparing sorafenib
versus sorafenib plus low-dose interferon (IFN), and we
report on predictive tissue biomarkers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Before they were enrolled on the study, patients were
required to sign an informed consent that was approved
by The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Institutional Review Board. Patients were
accrued at a single center (MDACC). Inclusion criteria
included pathologically confirmed metastatic clear cell
(conventional) RCC, no prior systemic therapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status of 0 or 1, no brain metastases, measurable disease
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST), a serum creatinine level 2.0 mg/dL,
normal serum calcium levels, and a serum bilirubin 1.5
times the upper limit of normal. Baseline body computed
tomography scans were obtained along with a magnetic
resonance imaging study of the brain. Bone scans were
obtained if a bone lesion was suspected.
Study Design
Patients were randomized to receive sorafenib (Bayer Inc.,
Pittsburgh, Pa) 400 mg orally twice daily or the combination of sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily plus IFN
(Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) at a dose of 0.5 MU

Cancer

subcutaneously twice daily. Dose reductions were permitted for 1 or both agents, depending on the nature of the
toxicity. Imaging studies were obtained every 8 weeks.
Patients continued to receive protocol treatment until
either progressive disease was documented or toxicity
precluded further participation on study. Response was
measured using RECIST, and confirmatory studies were
obtained at least 4 weeks after the measurement of a treatment response.
There are several nonoverlapping toxicities defined
for each agent. A treatment cycle was not interrupted
unless overlapping toxicities were observed, and only
the drug(s) responsible for observed toxicities were
adjusted or held. Doses were not re-escalated. Patients
could continue on study if 1 agent was discontinued for
toxicity. Sorafenib was reduced to Dose Level 1 (200
mg orally twice daily) or Dose Level 2 (200 mg orally
daily), and IFN was reduced to Dose Level 1 (0.5
MU daily). Further dose reductions resulted in drug
discontinuation.
Correlative Studies
Paraffin-embedded nephrectomy specimens were obtained
from 40 patients for the purposes of evaluating expression
and activation levels of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)
pathway components, including AKT, P70S6 kinase
(P70S6K), and S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP). Protein tissue microarrays were generated using a Beecher arrayer
(Beecher Instruments, Inc., Sun Prairie, Wis) and were
stained using total AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.,
Danvers, Mass), phosphorylated AKT S473 (pAKT)
(Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), P70S6K (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) phosphorylated S6RP serine 235236 (pS6) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and total
S6RP (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) antibodies. Image
capture and analysis were performed using the Ariol system (Applied Imaging, San Jose, Calif.). Each core was
evaluated individually at 10 and 20 magnification,
regions of viable tumor were gated, and areas of nonviable
tumor and nontumor tissue were excluded, and the core
was scanned at 20 magnification using TMA Navigator
software (Applied Imaging, San Jose, Calif). The percentage
involvement of biomarkers was obtained for each core.
Statistical Methods
A maximum of 80 patients were to be randomized equally
between treatment arms. The null hypothesis was that the
response in either arm would be <5%, and the alternate
hypothesis was that the response rate would exceed 20%.

A 2-stage design was implemented for each treatment arm
in parallel. For either arm, if at least 4 responses (10%)
were observed among the 40 evaluable patients, then the
regimen would continue. If no more than 1 response
(5%) was observed among the initial 20 patients, then
the arm would be terminated early. This design yielded at
least 92% power to detect a true response rate of 20%
and a 0.90 probability of a negative result if the true
response rate was no greater than 5% with a probability of
0.74 that treatment would be stopped early. The
Pocock-Simon minimization method23 was used to randomize patients according to the following stratification
factors: performance status (1 vs 0), anemia (no vs yes,
with yes based on a hemoglobin level <14 g/dL for men
or <12 g/dL for women), nephrectomy (no vs yes); lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) (not elevated vs elevated, with elevated defined as >1.5 times the upper limit of normal).
The randomization program based on this method was
developed in the Department of Biostatistics and Applied
Mathematics, and the program was available on an intranet website of MDACC. Only a pharmacist with an
appropriate username and password had access to the
program.
All reported analyses were in the intent-to-treat population. P values were 2-tailed and were considered significant at a <.05. Analyses were conducted using SAS for
Windows (release 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Response rates with 95% exact binomial confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Patients who had a CR or partial response (PR) were classified as responders.
Nonresponders included patients whose best evaluation
was stable disease or progressive disease. Patients who
were not on study long enough to be evaluated for
response were included in the analysis as treatment failures. The Fisher exact test was used to assess response by
treatment arm.
The survival endpoints that we investigated
included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival
(PFS), and duration of response. OS was defined as the
time from first treatment (or randomization for the 1
patient who did not receive treatment) to the date of either death or last follow-up for patients who remained
alive at the end of follow-up. PFS was defined as the
time from first treatment to the date of progression,
death, new treatment start, or last follow-up, whichever
occurred first. Duration of response was calculated as
the time from the first assessment of response until the
earliest event of disease progression, new treatment start,
or last follow-up.

Survival endpoints were evaluated using the KaplanMeier product-limit method and Cox proportional-hazards regression techniques. The proportional hazards
assumptions were verified using the methods of Lin
et al,24 and the assumptions held for each of the models
presented. For all modeling procedures, univariate models
were fit first to evaluate the predictive effect of each factor
alone; then, a reduced multivariate model was determined
using a step-wise backward selection procedure. The independent variables investigated included treatment arm
and the variables that were used in randomization (baseline ECOG performance status and baseline anemia).
Two other variables that were included in randomization,
nephrectomy and LDH, had no or very little variability
and, thus, were not included in the multivariate analysis.
The average percentage of AKT, pAKT, S6RP,
pS6RP, and p70S6k involvement was analyzed in specimens from 40 study participants. Intensity was not factored into the analysis. For each set of markers, the
correlations between the markers and the treatment arm
and between individual markers were analyzed using
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Spearman correlation coefficients, respectively. Univariate survival analysis considered all 40 samples in aggregate, regardless of treatment
arm; and, in the multivariate analyses, treatment arm was
added as a covariate. The study sponsor (the National
Cancer Institute’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program)
was involved in the study design, in the interpretation of
data, and in the writing of this report.

status, and anemia.

Patient Characteristics
From June 24, 2005 through June 18, 2007, 80 patients
(61 men and 19 women) were enrolled (40 patients per
arm). Patient demographics are presented in Table 1.
According to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC) criteria, 51%, 46%, and 3% of patients had
favorable-risk features, intermediate-risk features, or
poor-risk features, respectively. After randomization, 1
patient in the sorafenib plus IFN arm withdrew consent
before receiving study medication. Seven patients received
study medication but came off study before the first 8week response assessment. Of these, 5 patients came off
study because of toxicity, and the other 2 patients came
off study because of eligibility violations (1 patient who
had brain metastases and 1 who received previous radiation treatment). Treatment groups did not differ significantly by age at diagnosis, age at registration, sex, race/

Clinical Outcomes
The median follow-up for censored patients was 19.7
months (range, 0.4-34.2 months). At the time of study
analysis, 4 patients remained on study. Reasons that the
76 patients were taken off study included disease progression (n ¼ 53), toxicity (n ¼ 12), ineligibility (n ¼ 3), physician decision (n ¼ 4), consent withdrawal (n ¼ 4), and
noncompliance (n ¼ 1). Objective clinical response was
assessed for 72 patients who received study drug. Seven
patients who received at least 1 treatment and 1 patient
who did not receive a treatment were not evaluated for
response. These patients were included in the analysis as
treatment failures. Patients received a median of 6 cycles
(range, 0-24 cycles) of the study medication.
In the intent-to-treat population, the response rate
was 30% (95% CI, 16.6%-46.5%) in the sorafenib arm

and 25% (95% CI, 12.7%-41.2%) in the combination arm
(Table 2). There was no significant difference in response
by treatment arm in the evaluable population (n ¼ 72), in
the total treated population (n ¼ 79), or in the intent-totreat population (n ¼ 80). A major response (CR or PR)
was observed in 22 patients, whereas 37 patients had disease

the 1 patient who had a CR was 19.9 months; and, for the
patients who had a PR, the estimated median response duration was 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.6-13.1 months).
Response assessment was performed by the investigators. A
blinded, independent radiology audit of 20 patients’ scans
was performed by an MDACC radiologist. There was concordance between the investigator’s and radiologist’s assessment in 19 of the 20 patients.
The estimated median PFS was 7.39 months (95%
CI, 5.52-9.20 months) for the sorafenib arm and 7.56
months (95% CI, 5.19-11.07 months) for the sorafenib
plus IFN arm (Table 2). In univariate analysis, there was
no statistically significant difference in PFS by treatment
arm or ECOG performance status; however, patients with
baseline anemia trended toward a shorter PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% CI, 0.98-2.79; P ¼ .0583) (Table 3).
A multivariate model that included treatment arm,
ECOG performance status, and baseline anemia status
had no significant predictors of PFS.
The median OS was not reached in the sorafenib
arm and was 27.04 months (95% CI, from 22.31
months to not attained) in the combination arm. In
univariate analysis, no significant difference in OS by
treatment arm was detected (P ¼ .1219), but OS was
associated significantly with performance status and anemia at baseline (Table 3). Patients who had an ECOG

dose reductions were equivalent in each arm. Table 4 lists
the most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities. Fatigue and
neutropenia were more common in the combination arm.
It is noteworthy that hyperuricemia was substantially
more common in the sorafenib monotherapy arm. A few
rare but serious events occurred in each treatment arm.
One patient on the combination arm developed posterior
reversible encephalopathy syndrome in her second month
of therapy after developing hypertension.

performance status score of 1 had a 3.06 times greater
hazard of death (95% CI, 1.33-7.00 times greater hazard of death) compared with patients who had a performance status of 0 (P ¼ .0083), and patients who had
anemia at baseline had a 3.27 times greater hazard of
death (95% CI, 1.39-7.68 times greater hazard of
death) compared with patients who did not have anemia at baseline (P ¼ .0065).
In a multivariate model that included variables for
treatment arm, ECOG performance status, and baseline
anemia, there was a nonsignificant trend toward inferior
OS among patients in the sorafenib plus IFN arm (HR,
2.17; 95% CI, 0.92-5.12; P ¼ .0764). Patients who had a
performance status of 1 had a poorer prognosis compared
with patients who had a performance status of 0 (HR,
2.54; 95% CI, 1.04-6.20; P ¼ .0414). The association
between OS and baseline anemia reached borderline significance (P ¼ .0501), and anemic patients had a poorer
prognosis (HR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.00-6.13) (Table 3).

Biomarker Analysis
An analysis of tumor tissue biomarkers was conducted on tumor tissue from 22 patients in the sorafenib arm and 18
patients in the sorafenib plus IFN arm. There was no significant difference in marker levels by treatment arm; therefore,
all 40 samples were analyzed together. All markers were associated significantly with each other (Table 5). In univariate
analysis, no markers were associated significantly with PFS.
However, in a multivariate model that included treatment
arm and randomization variables (ECOG performance status and baseline anemia status), pAKT was associated significantly with PFS. With every percentage increase in pAKT,
there was a 3.7% increase in the hazard of disease progression (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08; P ¼ .0411). In addition, the univariate analysis indicated that OS had a
significant association with pAKT (HR, 1.05; 95% CI,
1.01-1.10; P ¼ .0243) but not with any of the other
markers. However, in the multivariate model that included
treatment arm and randomization variables, both AKT
(HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-0.99; P ¼ .0384) and pAKT
(HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29; P ¼ .0173) had statistically
significant associations. The survival hazard increased with
lower levels of AKT and with higher levels of pAKT.

Toxicity
A relatively equal number of patients required dose reductions or therapy discontinuation in each arm. Sorafenib

DISCUSSION

alone in the frontline treatment of metastatic RCC and is
the first full report of sorafenib monotherapy in the frontline setting. The use of randomized phase 2 trials has provided important guidance in the development of therapy
for RCC. A key example is the randomized comparison
between bevacizumab alone and the combination of bevacizumab plus erlotinib, which failed to demonstrate the
superiority of the combination arm25 despite the initial
promise of the combination in a single-arm study.26
In the current study, we did not detect significant
differences in response rate or PFS between the 2 arms,
and the 95% CIs were highly overlapping. Although it
can be argued that a better powering of the study may
have statistically strengthened the observations reported
here, it is unlikely that a paradigm-shifting therapeutic
strategy is being rejected.
Whether higher doses of IFN would have altered the
results in the current study is impossible to determine, but
we can use information from 2 single-arm phase 2 studies
that evaluated the combination of sorafenib with standard-dose IFN for the purposes of comparison.27,28 Ryan
et al evaluated the combination of sorafenib 400 mg orally
twice daily with IFN 10 MU 3 times weekly administered

to untreated patients with metastatic RCC. In the study
by Gollob et al, treatment consisted of 8-week cycles of
sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily plus IFN 10 MU subcutaneously 3 times weekly followed by a 2-week break
administered in the first-line and second-line settings.
Overall, the patient characteristics in those reports were
similar to those in the current study, and the outcomes of
patients arguably were similar to those observed with sorafenib monotherapy (see Table 6).
A striking finding in the current study was a
response rate of 30% for the sorafenib arm: This was significantly higher than the response rate of 10% reported
in the second-line phase 3 study published in 20073 and
similar to the rates reported from 2 phase 2 studies of sorafenib and IFN (Table 6). A frontline phase 2 study of sorafenib versus IFN reported a response rate of 5% for the
sorafenib arm.29 Equally striking in our study was the lack
of additional benefit provided by the addition of IFN to
sorafenib, refuting the hypothesis that the addition of
IFN to sorafenib was responsible for the higher response
rate. Two conclusions can be drawn from these findings:
First, the response rate is highly dependent on patient
selection; and, second, randomized studies provide

63

important control groups that contextualize clinical observations and decrease the risk of inappropriate attribution
of outcome to therapy when patient selection is the major
driver of outcome. In addition, the availability of effective
second-line therapy no doubt influenced the OS data in
our study.
Emerging data suggest that sorafenib inhibits various effector arms of the cellular immune system.,30-32
although differences in experimental design result in conflicting data.33 Nevertheless, it is possible that the antagonistic effect of sorafenib on dendritic cell activity32 and on
T-cell proliferation and activation30,31 are responsible in
part for the lack of additive or synergistic activity between
sorafenib and IFN.
Developing predictive markers for response is important for accelerating therapy development in RCC and
for improved patient selection. These exploratory analyses
are hypothesis generating, potentially prognostic, not
directly therapy related, and require prospective validation. In our analysis of PI3K pathway components, all
markers were associated significantly with each other (Table 5), suggesting internal cohesiveness of the pathway
being analyzed. Multivariate analysis revealed that elevated pAKT was correlated inversely with PFS and OS. It
is possible that epithelial drivers of survival, like activated
AKT, trigger the activation of alternate angiogenic pathways and that these pathways are responsible for the
induced and innate resistance to antiangiogenic therapy
that was observed clinically. The association of elevated
nonphosphorylated AKT with improved survival appears
to be contradictory to the pAKT data. Investigations performed by our collaborators suggest the AKT antibody
binds only the unphosphorylated protein and is not a
reflection of total AKT present (unpublished results).
Whether pAKT is predictive of outcome after treatment
with antiangiogenic therapy or is a prognostic biomarker
cannot be elucidated from the current research study,
because we did not incorporate a nonantiangiogenic therapy control arm in our study. In addition, we ran the risk
of obtaining false-positive associations through analysis of
multiple covariates. Even if it is determined that the activated PI3K pathway is predictive of response, this does
not guarantee that its blockade will be therapeutic. Nevertheless, careful study of this pathway will be an important
next step toward developing new therapies for patients
with refractory RCC.
In conclusion, the combination of sorafenib plus
IFN is well tolerated and, in the front-line setting, provides efficacy similar to that of sorafenib alone in the

64

front-line treatment of metastatic RCC. Despite the relatively small numbers of patients treated, we conclude that
the absence of CRs in the combination arm and a response
rate and PFS similar to those in the control arm suggest
that there was no additional benefit conferred by the combination therapy. On the basis of our findings, further
study of the combination of sorafenib plus IFN is not warranted. The association between elevated tumor pAKT
and inferior PFS and OS in patients who are treated with
sorafenib is a hypothesis-generating finding that requires
further mechanistic study.
