ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common lethal human
malignancies worldwide and its advanced status is frequently resistant to conventional
chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. We evaluated the cytotoxic effect of the
orally bioavailable dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, NVP-BGT226, on a panel of HCC cell
lines, since hyperactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway could represent a
biomolecular target for Small Inhibitor Molecules in this neoplasia. We analyzed the
drug activity in both normoxia and hypoxia conditions, the latter playing often a
relevant role in the induction of chemoresistance and angiogenesis.
In normoxia NVP-BGT226 caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell
cycle, induced apoptosis and autophagy at low concentrations. Interestingly the drug
inactivated p-Akt and p-S6 at < 10 nM concentration.
In hypoxia NVP-BGT226 maintained its cytotoxic efficacy at the same
concentration as documented by MTT assays and Western blot analysis. Moreover,
the drug showed in hypoxia inhibitory properties against angiogenesis by lowering
the expression of the transcription factor HIF-1α and of VEGF.
Our results indicate that NVP-BGT226 has a potent cytotoxic effect on HCC cell
lines also in hypoxia condition, thus emerging as a potential candidate for cancer
treatment in HCC targeted therapy.

for the treatment of resistant and advanced HCC, has
shown low response rate and serious side effects such
as hypertension, rash, fatigue, and hand and foot skin
reactions [7–9]. For this reason, an effective and welltolerated pharmaceutical profile for the treatment of
advanced HCC is requested to introduce new, potential
and therapeutic approaches.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a disease
increasing in incidence worldwide [1–5]. One of the most
prevalent reasons for the high mortality rate in patients
with HCC is the lack of effective treatment, especially for
patients with advanced disease [6]. Sorafenib, approved

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway is one of the most frequently
dysregulated signaling cascades in human malignancies, it
displays oncogenic potential and it is implicated in a wide
variety of different neoplasms, including HCC [10, 11].
Phosphorylation of Akt activates several substrates,
including the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), and induces
subsequent phosphorylation of downstream targets such
as the ribosomal S6 kinase. The activation of mTORC1
results in increased translation and protein synthesis
[12]. A second complex comprising mTOR, known as
mTORC2, more recently described, appears to act as a
feedback loop via Akt phosphorylation on Ser 473 [13].
Given the emerging importance of PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway for tumorigenesis in the liver, the
potential use of PI3K/Akt pathway modulators is
increasingly considered as a targeted therapeutic choice.
Furthermore PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays
also an important role in the regulation of angiogenesis
[14, 15], that represents a crucial event in tumor evolution
and metastasis. One of the most important stimuli for
angiogenesis is hypoxia, that represents a common feature
of the tumor microenvironment, since human solid tumors
are invariably less well-oxygenated than the normal
tissues from which they arose [16]. Sustained hypoxia
in a growing tumor is one of the most important stimuli
for increased VEGF production and this growth factor,
as well as its receptor, is up-regulated in HCC, whose
overexpression is inversely related with the prognosis and
survival of HCC patients [17].
The frequent activation of the PI3K pathway in
cancer and its crucial role in cell growth and survival has
made it a much relevant desired target for pharmacologic
intervention. The first PI3K pathway-targeted agents
approved for cancer treatment were the “rapalogs”
Everolimus (RAD001) and Temsirolimus (CCI779), both
with the capacity to inhibit the functional protein complex
mTORC1. In addition to these agents, other classes of
PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors have been developed:
one is composed by dual inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR
(and thus mTORC1 and mTORC2). NVP-BGT226
(BGT226) (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland), an
imidazoquinoline derivative, belong to this class being an
ATP-competitive dual PI3K/mTORC1/C2 inhibitor: it is a
potent pan-class I PI3K inhibitor (p110α, β, δ, and γ, with
a preference for the α-isoform -wild type and mutated-)
and is a mTORC1/2 catalytic inhibitor [18, 19].
It has been recently demonstrated that PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway regulates VEGF and HIF-1α expression,
and inhibitors targeting PI3K p110α decrease both VEGF
expression and angiogenesis in HCC in vitro model [20].
Therefore, in this study, we wanted to investigate
the antitumor activity of the orally bioavailable dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, NVP-BGT226 (BGT226), on a
panel of hepatocellular carcinoma (Mahlavu, SNU475,
SNU449, HepG2 and Hep3B) cell lines in either normoxia
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and hypoxia condition. All these HCC cell lines have an
hyperphosporylated Akt, as previously demonstrated by
us and by other research groups [21–25]. Mahlavu lack
the expression of PTEN and also SNU449 have a low
expression of this protein [21, 26].
BGT226 is in phase I/II clinical trials for the
treatment of advanced solid tumors, such as breast, head
and neck, endothelial cells and lung cancer [11, 18, 26–29]
and this is the first work showing the in vitro activity of
this PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibitor in HCC cells.
Treatments of HCC cells with BGT226 caused in normoxia
condition cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell
cycle, and induced apoptosis and autophagy at very low
doses. Moreover, BGT226 showed in hypoxia conditions
inhibitory properties against angiogenesis by inhibiting the
expression of HIF-1α and VEGF. Our results indicate that
the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BGT226, is cytotoxic for
HCC cell lines in normoxia and in hypoxia condition. It
is also a potent inhibitor of the expression of HIF-1α and
VEGF and may represent a new promising therapeutic
approach in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

RESULTS
BGT226 affects cell viability and is cytotoxic in
hepatocarcinoma cell lines
To determine whether the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
BGT226 could affect the viability of HCC, Mahlavu,
SNU475, SNU449, HepG2 and Hep3B cells were incubated
in the presence of increasing concentrations of the drug for
either 24 or 48 h. Cell viability rates were then analyzed by
MTT assays. The experiments documented that already at
24 h all the cell lines were very sensitive to BGT226 (data
not shown). After 48 h of treatment cell viability impairment
was more evident, with an IC50 value ranging from 0.55 μM
for Mahlavu to 1.35 μM for HepG2 cells (Figure 1A, 1B). It
should be noted that the range of sensitivity is very close and
no significant differences are observable among the different
cell lines. This observation strengthen the hypothesis that this
signaling pathway is altered in a similar way in these cell
lines that can be used as a representative panel.
We also investigated the effects of the drug on cell
cycle progression. Mahlavu and Hep3B cells were treated
for 24 h with increasing concentrations of the drug and
stained with Propidium Iodide (PI) for the Muse™ Cell
Analyzer. In both cell lines the analysis showed a significant
increase in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (Figure 1C).
No significant differences appeared between the activity of
BGT226 in Mahlavu and Hep3B cells, being the percentage
of cells blocked in G0/G1 phase very similar.

BGT226 induces both apoptosis and autophagy
Previous studies demonstrated that in solid tumors
BGT226 can induce apoptosis [11, 30]. In order to

establish whether decreased cell viability was related to
apoptosis in HCC cell lines, we treated Mahlavu, SNU475
and Hep3B cells for 24 h with increasing concentrations
of the drug, and we analyzed the expression levels of
PARP, Caspase 9 and the effector Caspase 7. After 24 h of
treatment, 0.5 μM BGT226 was able to induce cleavage
of PARP, Caspase 9 and Caspase 7 (Figure 2A). We then
analyzed apoptosis by Annexin-V staining in Mahlavu,
SNU475 and Hep3B cells treated with increasing
concentrations of BGT226 for 24 h. The drug induced
concentration-dependent apoptosis in all the three cell
lines (Figure 2B), with a more relevant effect in Mahlavu
and SNU475 than in Hep3B.
After 24 h of treatment with increasing concentrations
of BGT226, chromatin condensation was observable in
Mahlavu cells by DAPI staining (Figure 2C).
To further analyze whether the intrinsic pathway
(i.e., caspase-9) was involved in the proapoptotic action
of BGT226 in HCC cells, we examined the effect of the
pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, whose activity has
already been analyzed in different tumor cell lines [31,
32], administered alone and in combination with BGT226
for 24 h in Mahlavu and SNU449 cells. As shown in

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Figure 2D, Z-VAD-fmk 75 μM significantly inhibited
the cell death induced by BGT226 used at the IC50 value,
indicating that the apoptotic process mediates BGT226
cytotoxicity.
To evaluate whether the treatment with BGT226
could induce autophagy, we analyzed the expression of
microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)  A / B I
(non lipidated) and its conjugated form LC3A/B II
(lipidated) and the expression of another autophagyrelated protein, SQSTM1/p62 by Western blot. Lysosomal
degradation of autophagosomes leads to a decrease in
SQSTM1 levels during autophagy; conversely, autophagy
inhibitors stabilize SQSTM1 levels [33]. The levels of
LC3A/B II gradually increased whereas p62 decreased
in SNU475 and Mahlavu, in a dose dependent manner
(Figure 3A), thus showing the activation of autophagy
after BGT226 administration.
To verify whether autophagy was either a cell
survival or a cell death mechanism, we used the autophagy
inhibitor Chloroquine (CQ), since it has recently been
reported its ability to block autophagy by inhibiting
lysosomal proteases and autophagosome-lysosomal fusion
events [34, 35]. SNU475 and Mahlavu cells were treated

for 24 h with 0.5 μM BGT226 and 10 μM CQ, alone
and in combination, and expression of LC3A/B I-II was
assessed by Western blot. BGT226 induced the lipidation
of LC3I to LC3II and the addition of CQ further increased
LC3A/B II levels (Figure 3B).
We also found that autophagy could protect HCC
cells from the cytotoxic effects of BGT226. This was
assessed by MTT Assays, after treating SNU475 and
Mahlavu cells with 0.5 μM BGT226 and 10 and 25 μM CQ

to avoid a too high cytotoxicity that would result with a
higher concentration of the drug and that would prevent
the possibility to observe the additional effect of the two
drug combination. CQ, when used alone, displayed only
limited cytotoxic effects against SNU475 and Mahlavu
cells. However, when it was combined with BGT226, it
was possible to detect an increased cytotoxicity in both
cell lines (Figure 3C). To further confirm the protective

role of autophagy from the cytotoxic effect of BGT226 we
also used a different autophagy inhibitor, 3-Methyladenine
(3-MA) which blocks at an early stage autophagy by
inhibiting the class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
[36]. 3-MA alone did not affect significantly cells after
24 h of treatment. However, when it was combined with
0.5 μM BGT226, it showed an increased cytotoxicity in all
HCC cell lines (Figure 3D).

The administration of BGT226 in hypoxia condition
gradually increased the expression levels of LC3A/B II and
decreased the expression of SQSTM1/p62 in SNU475 and
Mahlavu cells in a dose dependent manner (Figure 5A).
To obtain a comparison with the normoxia data, we
also used Chloroquine (CQ) to inhibit autophagy either
alone or in combination with BGT226. Thus, SNU475
and Mahlavu cells were treated for 24 h in hypoxia
with BGT226 0.5 μM and CQ 10 μM, alone and in
combination, and expression of LC3A/B I-II was assessed
by Western blot. As shown in Figure 5B, BGT226 induced
the lipidation of LC3A/B I to LC3A/B II. The addition of
CQ further increased the expression of LC3 A/B II.
Finally, as in normoxia, we also found that
autophagy protects HCC cells from the cytotoxic effects
of BGT226. This was assessed by MTT assays, after
treating SNU475 and Mahlavu cells with BGT226 0.5 μM
and CQ 10 and 25 μM for 24 h. CQ alone displayed only
limited cytotoxic effects against SNU475 and Mahlavu
cells. However, when it was combined with BGT226, it
was possible to detect an increased cytotoxicity in both
cell lines (Figure 5C). To extend the analysis concerning
the protective role of autophagy also in hypoxia we
used the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. The inhibitor alone
did not affect cell growth of Mahlavu and Hep3B after
24 h of treatment. However, when it was combined with
0.5 μM BGT226, it was possible to detect an increased
cytotoxicity in both cell lines (Figure 5D).
Therefore we were able to assess the same effect
of BGT226 also in hypoxia condition and the same role
of autophagy in both conditions, normoxia and hypoxia.

BGT226 inhibits the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway in HCC cells in normoxia and hypoxia
conditions
Since in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines the
BGT226-dependent modulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal
axis has been demonstrated [11], we determined whether this
drug also affected downstream signal transduction factors
that promote PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated cell survival.
When the five cell lines were treated with increasing
concentrations of BGT226 for 1 h in normoxic conditions,
the phosphorylation of Akt and its substrate GSK3 α/β, of
mTORC1/2 and of mTORC1 substrate S6 was effectively
suppressed in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A).
Growth in hypoxia condition can result in a tumor
with a more aggressive and malignant phenotype, with
a very different sensitivity to drugs of the therapeutic
protocol [37–39].
Thus, we first compared the activity of BGT226
in the modulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in
normoxia or hypoxia conditions with the contemporary
administration of the drug at very low concentrations
(1-5-10 nM) for 1 h in Mahlavu and SNU475
(Figure 4B). BGT226 was able to suppress both Akt
and S6 phosphorylation. It is worth noting the very
potent dephosphorylating effect of this drug at < 10 nM
concentration and this effect appeared to be independent
from the normoxia or hypoxia state of the cells. To better
investigate a possible PI3K hyperactivation in hypoxia
conditions, we collected the five HCC cell lines after 24 h
hypoxia and compared the expression of phosphorylated
and total Akt with normoxic cells. As showed in Figure 4C,
the expression levels of activated and total Akt in
normoxia and hypoxia remained unchanged. To further
explore the efficacy of BGT226 in hypoxia, Mahlavu,
SNU475 and SNU449 were exposed for 24 h in hypoxia,
followed by 1 h treatment with increasing concentrations
of BGT226. Results showed that BGT226 was able to
suppress Akt phosphorylation also in 24 h hypoxic cells
(Figure 4D).
To further assess this observation, MTT assays in four
HCC cell lines were performed. Mahlavu, SNU475, Hep3B
and SNU449 were incubated in the presence of increasing
concentrations of the drug for 24 h, in normoxia or hypoxia
conditions. Results showed similar activity of the drug in
normoxia as compared with hypoxia (Figure 4E).

BGT226 inhibits the expression of HIF-1α
and VEGF in HCC cells
A low oxygen level is characteristic of solid tumors
and represents a negative prognostic factor for cancer
patient survival. The response of cancer cells to hypoxia
drives neo-angiogenesis but also enhances malignant
phenotype development and an increased production of
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), containing HIF-1α and
HIF-1β subunits, that acts as a key regulatory transcription
factor responsible for adaptive cellular changes. HIF-1α
protein is suppressed in cells under normoxic conditions
(20–22% O2) and its expression is rapidly induced by
hypoxic conditions (1–2% O2). In humans, HIF-1 has
been shown to up-regulate expression of genes affecting
a range of target areas of physiology, and it is a major
regulator of VEGF, an important growth factor involved
in angiogenesis.
Therefore we first evaluated the induction of
HIF-1α in HCC cells at increasing times of hypoxia. As

shown in Figure 6A, the expression of HIF-1α increased
progressively along with exposure to hypoxia.
Treatment with increasing concentrations BGT226
under hypoxic conditions showed a significant, dose
dependent inhibition of HIF-1α in Mahlavu and Hep3B
cells (Figure 6B). The efficacy of BGT226 in hypoxic
condition was further confirmed after treatment of 24 h
and detection for VEGF levels. Increasing concentrations
of the drug suppressed or reduced the expression of
this crucial member of the hypoxia microenvironment
(Figure 6B).

The panel of HCC cells chosen for this work
displays different levels of activated Akt and therefore
it is an ideal model for the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
NVP-BGT226.
Several mechanisms may be responsible for the
activation of PI3K/Akt in HCC. The high frequency of
the PI3K p110α gene (PIK3CA) mutations and/or its upregulation in patients with a shorter survival is responsible
for the Akt hyperactivation found in HCC with poor
prognosis [42]. Moreover, impaired expression of PTEN
could be involved in the regulation of PI3K/Akt activity.
Ruan et collaborators demonstrated that overexpression of
PTEN significantly reduced the proliferation of HepG2,
and the same cell line transfected with PTEN were more
sensitive to sorafenib in terms of its ability to inhibit
proliferation and to induce apoptosis [43].
A reduction in cell viability was observed in our
panel of HCC cell lines treated with low concentrations
of BGT226 for 48 h. Among the five tested cell lines,
Mahlavu and SNU449 cells were the most sensitive to

DISCUSSION
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has a critical
role in the pathogenesis of HCC, and it has emerged to
be an important therapeutic target for anticancer drug
development, since many clinical studies have indicated
that activation and deregulation of PI3K/Akt pathway play
roles in various human cancers [40, 41].

the drug, with an IC50 value of nearly 0.5 μM, even if the
difference is not so relevant when compared to Hep3B,
being the IC50 value of 1.22 μM.
Cell cycle arrest in cancer cells is a major indicator
of anticancer activity and has been implicated in different
cancers, including HCC [44]. The anti-proliferative effect
of BGT226 induced after 24 h cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1
phase. The cytotoxicity of the drug was mediated by the
apoptotic process, as demonstrated by both Annexin V
analysis and DAPI-stained samples and with a pan-caspase
inhibitor that blocked BGT226-induced apoptosis.
Autophagy is a response to growth limiting
conditions, such as nutrient depletion, hypoxia and
the presence of cytotoxic drugs [45] and it may trigger
increased induction of apoptosis in cells [46]. The
correlation between autophagy and tumorigenesis has been
explored extensively, but whether autophagy acts as a protumorigenic or anti-tumor player in tumor development
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and cancer therapy, still has to be fully elucidated [47, 48].
However, autophagy has been found to be associated with
drug resistance in HCC [35].
We documented that BGT226 also induced
autophagy in HCC cells and its inhibition by CQ and
by 3-MA further sensitized HCC cells to the cytotoxic
effects of 24 h of BGT226. These findings suggest that
in HCC cells autophagy could have a tumor protecting
role when neoplastic cells are treated with PI3K/Akt/
mTOR inhibitors. Due to these properties CQ has been
also studied as a potential agent in cancer therapy, since
autophagy could act as a cell-survival pathway in cancer,
in agreement with our data [49–51].
In this work we demonstrated for the first time that in
HCC models BGT226 has anticancer effects in HCC cells,
and these effects act on the proliferation, apoptosis and
angiogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that its role could
not only reflect therapeutic potential in a normoxic condition
17155

for tumor cells, but it could also improve therapeutic options
for HCC also in a hypoxic microenvironment.
The dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BGT226, has
been investigated for the treatment of hematological
malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemias [19,
52], alone, in combination or in comparison with other
drugs such as gefitinib or NVP-BEZ235 in different solid
tumor models, including non-small cell lung cancer, head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer,
multiple myeloma and breast cancer [11, 26, 29, 53].
Gefitinib treated cells displayed increased levels
of phosphorylation in IGF-1R and Akt, indicating the
intensified activation of this cancer-associated signaling
pathway in Mahlavu cells [54]. Therefore the efficacy of
BGT226 acquires relevance in gefitinib resistant models
such as Mahlavu cells.
Since BGT226 has been used with efficacy in this
HCC model, it may therefore be considered as a potential
therapeutic options in other solid tumors such as colon,
ovary or stomach.
Until now, BGT226 activity has been analyzed only
in normoxia condition. Therefore in these solid neoplasms
BGT226 may have a potential role in developing new
therapeutic strategies where the hypoxic conditions could
limit drug efficacy.
In this study we observed that BGT226 was
capable at very low concentrations to induce Akt and S6
dephosphorylation and also reduced the phosphorylation of
mTORC1/2 after 1 h of drug exposure. Interestingly BGT226
maintained these properties also in hypoxia condition.
Tumor hypoxia leads to resistance to radiotherapy
and anticancer chemotherapy as well as predisposing
for increased tumor metastases [16]. In HCC it has been
reported that hypoxia enhances proliferation [55, 56] and
suppresses differentiation and apoptosis [57, 58], resulting
in tumor malignancy.
Therefore hypoxia cause cellular changes that can
result in a more clinically aggressive phenotype and it is
of interest the development of therapeutic strategies that
can overcome this resistance.
BGT226 appears to be an interesting candidate for
this strategy, since it was effective in both normoxia and
hypoxia conditions as demonstrated by MTT assay and
Western blot analysis with the suppression of cell viability
and the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway. As expected autophagy in both conditions
resulted activated after drug exposure.
HIF-1 plays a central role as the main regulator of
the hypoxic transcription response [59, 60]. Increased
concentrations of HIF-1 in the proteome of a hypoxic cell
result from increased transcription of HIF-1α and HIF1β genes and decreased HIF-1α protein degradation, an
example of hypoxia-mediated post translational control
[61, 62]. This transcription factor has been shown to have
several transcriptional targets including VEGF, the bestcharacterized angiogenic growth factor [63].

Our results showed the inhibitory activity of
BGT226 in the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in
hypoxia condition. Increasing concentrations of the
drug suppressed in a dose dependent manner both these
crucial members of hypoxia microenvironment, thus
hypothesizing also its potential anti-angiogenic role.
HCC is a highly-vascularized, neoplastic disease with
rapid growth and repetitive vascular invasion, and the process
of angiogenesis could be a target for novel prognostic and
therapeutic approaches to HCC, involving VEGF [64].
In conclusion, BGT226 inhibits the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway and shows potent cytotoxic activity by
inhibiting cell growth and proliferation in parallel with
increasing caspase-dependent and independent apoptosis.
BGT226 may therefore represent a potential
anticancer agent in HCC for its capability to target the
hyperactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
and to inhibit, in hypoxia microenvironment, increased
translation and synthesis of proteins such as HIF-1α and
VEGF, from which may depend tumor progression.

Cell cycle analysis was performed using the Muse™
Cell Analyzer (Merck Millipore, Milan, Italy). In brief,
after 24 h of treatment, cells were harvested, centrifugated
at 300 x g for 5 min and washed once with 1X PBS. After
fixing them with 70% ethanol for at least 3 h at –20°C,
cells were centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min, washed once
with 1X PBS and then 200 μl of Muse™ Cell Cycle
reagent was added to each tube with an incubation of 30
min at room temperature in the dark. Samples were then
analyzed according to the instrument protocol.
Moreover, analysis of apoptosis was performed by
Annexin-V/7-AAD-Assay using Muse™ Cell Analyzer.
In brief, cells treated with increasing concentrations of
BGT226 were harvested by trypsinization after 24 h of
treatment, and a 100 μl cell suspension was labeled for
20 min in the dark with the same volume of the Muse™
Annexin-V & Dead Cell reagent (Merck Millipore).
Subsequently, quantitative detection of Annexin-V/7AAD positive cells was performed with the Muse™ Cell
Analyzer.

DAPI staining
Cell nuclear morphology was evaluated by
fluorescence microscopy following DAPI staining. Cells
were treated with BGT226 for 24 h in normoxia condition.
The cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4), cytocentrifuged,
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and stained for 3 min
with 1 μg/ml DAPI. The cells were then washed with PBS,
specimens were embedded in glycerol with antifading agent
(DABCO) and examined under Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence
microscope (Zeiss, Germany).
