ABSTRACT
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which epithelial cells loose
their polarity and become motile mesenchymal cells, is a determinant of melanoma
metastasis. We compared gene expression signatures of mesenchymal-like melanoma
cells with those of epithelial-like melanoma cells, and identified Thrombospondin 1
(THBS1) as highly up-regulated in the mesenchymal phenotype. This study
investigated whether THBS1, a major physiological activator of transforming
growth factor (TGF)-beta, is involved in melanoma EMT-like process. We sought to
examine expression patterns in distinct melanoma phenotypes including invasive,
de-differentiated, label-retaining and drug resistant populations that are putatively
associated with an EMT-like process.
Here we show that THBS1 expression and secretion was elevated in melanoma
cells exhibiting invasive, drug resistant, label retaining and mesenchymal phenotypes
and correlated with reduced expression of genes involved in pigmentation. Elevated
THBS1 levels were detected in Vemurafenib resistant melanoma cells and inhibition
of THBS1 led to significantly reduced chemoresistance in melanoma cells. Notably,
siRNA-mediated silencing of THBS1 and neutralizing antibody to THBS1 reduced
invasion in mesenchymal-like melanoma cells, while ectopic THBS1 expression in
epithelial-like melanoma cells enhanced invasion. Furthermore, the loss of THBS1
inhibited in vivo motility of melanoma cells within the embryonic chicken neural tube.
In addition, we found aberrant THBS1 protein expression in metastatic melanoma
tumor biopsies. These results implicate a role for THBS1 in EMT, and hence THBS1 may
serve as a novel target for strategies aimed at the treatment of melanoma invasion
and drug resistance.

by melanoma cells involves the reactivation of a
developmental epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT)-like program [4-6]. The complex mechanisms
involved in this process in melanoma remain largely
unknown.
EMT describes a reprogramming of epithelial
cells that leads to the loss of epithelial characteristics,
notably polarity and cell adhesion, and the acquisition of a
mesenchymal phenotype with increased invasive abilities.
It occurs during normal development as part of processes
such as gastrulation and neural crest cell migration [7].
During cancer progression, this phenotype is associated
with tumor invasion, metastatic dissemination, and
acquisition of resistance to drug treatment [8, 9]. Cadherin
switching is a hallmark of EMT, leading to the downregulation and replacement of the cell surface adhesion
molecule E-cadherin by N-cadherin, enabling motility
[10-12].
In various cancers, EMT leads to the generation
of cancer cells possessing stem cell attributes of
tumor-­
initiation and resistance to chemotherapy [8].
In melanoma, a sub-population of slow-cycling cells
(defined by label-retention) which exhibit efficient
tumor-initiating capacity, have properties associated with
stemness, and are resistant to various anticancer drugs has
been identified [13].
Thrombospondins comprise a family of homologous
proteins that regulate cellular phenotype and extracellular
structure during tissue genesis and remodelling.
Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) was the first member to
be identified, and has been shown to modulate tumor
progression and metastasis [14, 15]. Whereas the role of
THBS1 in angiogenesis in melanoma is well documented,
its role in tumor metastasis is only just emerging [16,
17]. THBS1 has been identified as a major physiological
activator of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a
potent elicitor of EMT [18, 19]. However, a role of THBS1
in mediating EMT in melanoma remains to be elucidated.
This study therefore aimed to reveal the functional roles of
THBS1 during melanoma progression by assessing THBS1
expression and its effects on the functional characteristics
of melanoma cells, particularly those associated with
mesenchymal transformation.

These changes in EMT markers are often associated with
functional change toward an invasive phenotype [21]. We
evaluated the expression of classical EMT genes, E- and
N-cadherins using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRTPCR) in a panel of 54 human melanoma cell lines that
were derived from resected melanoma metastases [22].
Expression patterns of these two molecules in the cell
lines varied from high N-cadherin with no E-cadherin
expression, high E-cadherin with no or low N-cadherin,
to intermediate levels of both (Figure 1A).
We divided the lines into those expressing
E-cadherin and those lacking E-cadherin expression,
and their gene expression patterns were compared
using previously generated whole genome microarray
expression profiling data [22]. 634 probes representing
552 genes were differentially expressed between the
two classes of cell lines (Supplementary Table S1).
As expected E-cadherin expression was higher in the
lines identified as E-cadherin expressing by qRT-PCR
(13.5 fold), and N-cadherin expression was higher in
the lines lacking E-cadherin expression by qRT-PCR.
A principal components analysis based on the differential
expression gene list largely segregated the two classes
of cell lines, although with some overlap between lines
with intermediate levels of E- and N-cadherin, perhaps
representing a mixed phenotype (Supplementary
Figure S1). A gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of
the cell lines revealed gene sets associated with TGF-beta
signaling [23], cell migration [24, 25], ECM modulation
[26] and EMT [27-29]. Significantly enriched gene sets
can be found in Supplementary Table S2. Based on the
GSEA results, and the evidence of opposing E- and
N-cadherin expression, we therefore labelled the cell lines
mesenchymal- and epithelial-like.
We chose to focus on Thrombospondin 1
(THBS1), which showed 19 fold higher expression in the
mesenchymal-like cells. qRT-PCR confirmed THBS1
mRNA expression levels were higher in mesenchymallike cells (Figure 1B). A subset of high and low THBS1
expressing cell lines, as determined by qRT-PCR, was
subjected to solid-phase ELISA. This detected little or no
THBS1 secretion in conditioned medium from epitheliallike cells, whereas mesenchymal-like cells secreted
significant amounts of THBS1 into the medium (Figure 1C).
As THBS1 is a known activator of TGF-beta [18]
and TGF-beta has a pivotal function in the progression
of EMT [30, 31], we examined the level of TGF-beta
secretion in a subset of high and low THBS1 secreting
melanoma cell lines. THBS1 high cell lines secreted
high TGF-beta1 in contrast to THBS1 low cell lines that
secreted no TGF-beta1 into the medium (Supplementary
Figure S2A). To extend these findings, we analyzed
a cutaneous melanoma dataset available from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (http://www.cbioportal
.org) [32, 33]. Mutual exclusivity data from 376 melanoma

phenotype express high levels of Thrombospondin

At the molecular level, EMT in melanoma cells is
characterized by a series of coordinated changes including
down-regulation of the adherens junction molecule

patients revealed that both THBS1 and TGF-beta1 are
co-expressed (Odds ratio =3.4, p=0.036, Fisher’s exact
test). TGF-beta1 treatment in two epithelial-like melanoma
cell lines induced THBS1 expression in a time-dependent
manner (Supplementary Figure S2B). These data indicate
that THBS1 expression is associated with TGF-beta
signaling in melanoma cells.

MelanA (MLANA) (fold change: 37), Tyrosinase (TYR)
(fold change: 27), and MITF (fold change: 10) were
up-regulated in the epithelial-like cells examined. qRT-PCR
analysis showed expression of melanoma differentiation
markers MLANA, TYR and MITF in the panel of 54
melanoma cell lines. Regression analysis revealed an inverse
correlation of THBS1 expression with all three genes tested
(p<0.005 in each case) (Supplementary Figure S3). This
demonstrates the association between THBS1 expression and
a de-differentiated phenotype in melanoma.

Thrombospondin 1 expression negatively
correlates with differentiation markers of
melanoma
De-differentiation, which is characterized by the
loss of expression of genes involved in pigmentation, is
often associated with aggressive phenotype in melanoma
[6, 34]. A key determinant of melanoma differentiation
sub-population identity is conferred by the expression
and activation of microphthalmia-associated transcription
factor (MITF). In melanoma, the induction of MITF
expression promotes expression of differentiation markers
and the inhibition of invasion [35]. Differentiation markers

for slow-cycling melanoma cells required for continuous

expression is associated with label-retaining cells (LRC)
in melanoma, we isolated these cells by using CM-Dil

cell division (Figure 2A). After culturing the labelled
cells for two weeks, the majority of cells diluted the
label to undetectable levels, while a sub-population of
cells continued to be brightly labelled (Figure 2B). To
ensure that these LRC were not an in vitro artifact of
the culture conditions employed, we labelled melanoma

After three weeks of tumor growth, a small percentage of

specimen (Figure 2C).

(Supplementary Figure S4). LRC were therefore FACSsorted from 4 cell lines based on dye-retention (Dilbright)
and subjected to a whole genome expression analysis.
Genes significantly up- or down-regulated are listed
in Supplementary Table S3. THBS1 was significantly
up-regulated in the dye-retention population. Other
up-regulated genes were associated with EMT and secretory
functions. THBS1 and other proteins enriched in LRCs can
be connected to each other based on published associations
and analyzed by STRING (Figure 2E). We confirmed
significant up-regulation of THBS1 by qRT-PCR performed
on Dilbright cells derived from four melanoma cell lines on the
array. This was validated independently on two additional
cell lines (LM-MEL-33 and LM-MEL-53) (Figure 2F).
A gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of this dataset

identified gene sets associated with pertinent cell types
and biological functions, notably; EMT [27-29], TGFbeta signaling [23], invasion [24, 25], and chemotherapyresistant cancer cells [36, 37] (Supplementary Table S4).

Thrombospondin 1 expression is associated with
increased melanoma cell invasion
Invasion is an important functional change that
accompanies EMT [21]. The role of THBS1 in melanoma
cell invasion was evaluated using mesenchymal- and
epithelial-like melanoma cells in matrigel based transwell
invasion assays. THBS1 expressing mesenchymal-like
lines were highly invasive. Conversely, epithelial-like

cells were less invasive and showed little or no THBS1
expression (Figure 3A).
To confirm the role of THBS1 in invasion, a THBS1
expression construct was generated and transfected into
epithelial-like cells LM-MEL-34 and LM-MEL-62.
A stable clone overexpressing THBS1 was established
for each line. Overexpression of THBS1 protein in these
epithelial-like melanoma cells was confirmed by immunostaining (Figure 3B), and greatly enhanced their invasive
ability (Figure 3C&D).

RNA interference in vitro with two different siRNAs
was used to evaluate the role of THBS1 in invasion.
siRNA treatment silenced THBS1 expression at mRNA
level over 80% in LM-MEL-44, -53, -33 and -38 (Figure
4A). Immuno-staining confirmed reduction in THBS1
protein expression following knockdown with siRNA
(Supplementary Figure S5A). ELISA also confirmed
reduced secretion of THBS1 following knockdown
(Supplementary Figure S5B).

Knockdown of THBS1 in more epithelial-like
melanoma cells expressing THBS1 and some epithelial
markers showed significant increase in E-cadherin levels
(Supplementary Figure S5C&D). This restoration in
E-cadherin levels was associated with a parallel increase
in expression of MLANA, TYR and MITF (Supplementary
Figure S5E, F&G). Analysis of the cutaneous melanoma
dataset consisting of 376 melanoma patients available
from TCGA revealed an increase in mRNA expression
of THBS1 in 3% of patients. This altered subset of
patients showed significantly low E-cadherin protein
expression compared with patients with unaltered
THBS1 expression (Supplementary Figure S5H). These
data confirm the inverse correlation between THBS1
expression and E-cadherin expression that was observed
in our melanoma cell line studies in a large clinical
tumor dataset.

Decreased invasion was observed in all cell lines
transfected with THBS1 siRNA, as compared with the
control siRNA treated cells (Figure 4B). To further confirm
the role of THBS1 in melanoma invasion, melanoma cells
were treated with an anti-THBS1 antibody and subjected
to invasion assays. Antibody treatment decreased the
number of invaded cells in all four cell lines tested
(Figure 4C). Thus, loss of THBS1 contributed to the
restoration of E-cadherin levels and inhibition of invasion
in melanoma cells.
We assessed THBS1 function in an in vivo model
of melanoma cell plasticity and invasion, the chick
embryo. The model involves the injection of melanoma
cells into the neural tube of developing chicken embryos
where the cells acquire a motile phenotype and follow
the migratory path of their ancestral cell types into the
surrounding tissues. It therefore enables assessment of
functions that are relevant to the metastatic process such

as invasion, cellular polarity and cellular positioning
[38, 39]. Melanoma cells were transfected with siRNA
targeting THBS1, cultured as a hanging drop for 24 hours
and introduced into the trunk neural tube of a developing
chick embryo. THBS1 siRNA treated cells demonstrated
a significant reduction in emigration from the neural
tube in vivo into the surrounding tissue (Figure 5A&B).
Cross-sections of chick embryos confirmed that
numerous control siRNA treated cells migrate out of
the neural tube in contrast to THBS1 siRNA treated
cells that predominantly remain at the site of injection
(Figure 5C). These results suggest a role for THBS1 in
melanoma invasion in vivo in response to physiological
environmental signals.

in melanoma cells treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy
agents, such as taxol, cisplatin and 5-flurouracil after
72 hours (Supplementary Figure S6A). Next, we assessed
whether THBS1 might play a role in therapies specifically
targeting activated BRAF. To relate our results to findings
from studies with BRAF V600E-specific inhibitors, we
clustered gene expression microarray data from a publication
examining mechanisms of resistance to the activated
BRAF-inhibitor PLX4032 by analysing the gene set that we
identified to be up-regulated in the mesenchymal-like cells
(Figure 2E & Supplementary Figure S6B) [40]. Data
from two of PLX4032 resistant cell lines (M229 and
M238) clustered together and demonstrated up-regulation
of mesenchymal-associated genes including THBS1 in
comparison to the parental cell lines (Supplementary
Figure S6B). Both lines have previously been described as
undergoing a change in morphology characteristic of EMT
during the acquisition of resistance, whereas the cell line
that did not up-regulate the LRC genes (M249) acquired
resistance via a genetic mutation of NRAS and did not
undergo morphological change [40]. These data show that in
some cases BRAF-resistance is accompanied by an induction

Thrombospondin 1 is upregulated in a subset of

Drug resistance can be associated with the EMT
process [4]. To examine whether THBS1 expression was
associated with the acquisition of drug resistance, six
melanoma cell lines were treated with chemotherapy
agents. qRT-PCR showed induction of THBS1 expression

DISCUSSION

of THBS1 expression and acquisition of a mesenchymal gene
expression pattern.
We next established two PLX4720 resistant
cell lines from the V600E BRAF mutated parental
lines by continuous culture in the presence of 5μM or
1μM of the drug over 10 weeks (LM-MEL-28 R1 and­
LM-MEL-64 R3). qRT-PCR and ELISA revealed that
the expression and secretion of THBS1 was higher in
LM-MEL-28R1 and LM-MEL-64R3, when compared
with the drug sensitive parental cell lines (Figure 6A&B).
Furthermore, depletion of THBS1 with siRNA treatment
resulted in significant restoration of drug sensitivity in the
resistant cell lines (Figure 6C&D). These data show that
inhibition of THBS1 can impact on sensitivity to drugs
that act via an independent signaling pathway. This raises
the possibility that the THBS1/TGF-beta axis may enable
drug resistance though a mechanism mediated by cellular
plasticity and unrelated to the commonly described
alternative MAPK signaling mechanisms.

This study examined the roles of THBS1, a gene
which is highly expressed in mesenchymal-like but not
or at lower levels in epithelial-like melanoma cell lines.
THBS1 was associated with increased invasion and drug
resistance. THBS1 expression was also increased in labelretaining melanoma cell sub-populations. Inhibition, either
with neutralizing antibody or RNAi, reduced invasion of
melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. RNAi mediated
loss of THBS1 also restored drug sensitivity in BRAF
V600E mutated cells that developed drug resistance
following exposure to a BRAF inhibitor.
Phenotypes similar to the epithelial- and
mesenchymal-like melanoma cells described here
have been demonstrated by Hoek et al., who classified
melanoma cell lines based on invasion, high proliferation
rate, and susceptibility to growth inhibition by TGFbeta treatment. Cell lines unaffected by TGF-beta were
in general invasive and lost expression of MITF and
associated differentiation markers. Switching between
these proliferative and invasive phonotypes was proposed
as a mechanism for tumor progression [41]. As these subpopulations conform to the EMT dichotomy, the Hoek
phenotype switching model can be seen as a variant of
EMT occurring in a non-epithelial cancer. Induction of
EMT is often associated with wide-spread transcriptional
changes via the activation of specific transcription factors
and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms [9]. Recent
research showed that a reversible EMT-TF (transcription
factor) reprogramming involving upregulation of ZEB1/

Thrombospondin 1 is expressed in metastatic
melanoma patient tumors
THBS1 protein expression patterns in melanoma
tumors were determined by immunohistochemical staining
of a tissue microarrays (TMA) comprising of tumors from
103 patients with stage III and IV metastatic melanoma.
THBS1 expression was detected in 61% of metastatic
melanoma patient tumors (Figure 7A&B). The subcellular
location was identified as predominantly cytoplasmic.

TWIST1 paralleled by downregulation of SNAIL2/ZEB2
occurs in human melanoma. This EMT-TF reprogramming
is followed by the reduction in the expression of MITF
[42] which may lead to the establishment of functional
divergent melanoma cell populations based on the
“rheostat model” [43]. In our system, THBS1 is highly
expressed in mesenchymal-like cells that express low
MITF and display an invasive phenotype. This contrasts
with earlier studies where low levels of THBS1 expression
have been associated with increased recurrence rates
and decreased overall survival rates in several human
cancers [44].
Importantly, THBS1 is a multifunctional protein
with different functional and structural domains and has a
variety of biological activities [15, 44]. Due to its several
binding partners, the sum of downstream signals derived
from the molecules occupied by the full-length protein
may result in different consequences for the cell depending
on the availability of THBS1 interacting proteins [45].
THBS1 has been previously described as an inhibitor of
angiogenesis and tumourigenesis [17, 46] and mimetics
of THBS1 have been trialled as anti-angiogenic agents
[45]. It is conceivable that targeting angiogenic factors
with non-redundant roles can achieve not only preventing
tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, but also hindering
the direct growth and invasion of tumor cells. Different
approaches have been proposed to exploit protein-protein
interactions in order to develop novel inhibitor peptide
sequences or non-peptide, small molecule mimetics of
THBS1 domains that block angiogenesis [45].
For instance, a THBS1 derived anti-angiogenic
peptide ABT-510 has been tested clinically and failed to
show antitumor effects in melanoma and sarcoma patients
in phase II clinical trials [47, 48]. Most notably, we show
a role for THBS1 in TGF-beta regulation indicating
therapeutic potential beyond inhibiting angiogenesis.
This may provide opportunities for therapeutic targeting
despite the clinical failure of the THBS1-derived antiangiogenic peptide. As with a wide range of molecules
in cancer, an anti-angiogenic molecule could well lead
to hypoxia in tumors and as a consequence the induction
of an aggressive phenotype resulting ultimately in
de-differentiation and metastasis [49-52].
THBS1 can be epigenetically silenced in melanomas,
marking it as a potential tumor-suppressor gene [46].
Contrasting, THBS1 has been described as an immune
modulator, both through the activation of regulatory
T cells, and by facilitating the activation of TGF-beta, an
immunosuppressive cytokine. A recent study showed that
the transcription factor SNAIL induces EMT in melanoma
and leads to an increase in THBS1 expression and results
in immunosuppression and enhanced metastasis [16].
Similarly, we demonstrated that in vivo THBS1 knockdown
abrogates the invasive/plastic potential of melanoma
cells within the chicken neural tube. The avian embryo

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

has emerged as a useful site for analysing melanoma cell
behaviour within a developmental microenvironment
since it provides imaging and surgical accessibility to
manipulate and monitor the transplanted tumor [53-55].
Additionally, the biology of cells within the neural crest is
well understood and since melanocytes are neural-crestderived cells, it is likely that the environmental signals in
this model are pertinent to melanoma cell motility. Thus
the interaction between melanoma and motile embryonic
neural crest cells provide a functional context, and
thereby a valuable model for interrogating the molecular
regulation of migrating melanoma [38, 39].
Although we have clearly demonstrated that THBS1
mediates enhanced melanoma invasion in vitro and in
vivo, previous studies that evaluated the role of THBS1 in
cancer cell invasion have yielded mixed results. Although
THBS1 expression was inversely correlated with cell
invasion in thyroid cancer in one study [56], other studies
reported that THBS1 promotes cell invasion in breast
cancer, thyroid cancer, colon cancer and prostate tumors
[57-59]. In addition, knock-out of THBS1 in an animal
model of breast cancer led to growth of the primary tumor
but a decrease in the number of metastases [61]. Thus,
the pathological roles and clinical significance of THBS1
may depend on the nature of the model and on the stage
of tumor progression. To better evaluate role of THBS1
in human melanoma, we determined its expression in
metastatic melanoma tumor biopsies. THBS1 protein was
located in tumor cells and was undetectable in stroma. This
contrasts with gastric cancer, where THBS1 localized to
stroma [62], indicating apparent tissue-specific differences
depending on cancer type.
The mechanism whereby THBS1 promotes
melanoma invasion remains poorly understood, however
we demonstrate that this is likely linked to TGF-beta
activation. TGF-beta 1 is secreted in a biologically
inactive latent form and activation of this latent
TGF-beta 1 is required for biological activity [19].
THBS1 has been identified as a major physiological
activator of TGF-beta 1 both in vivo and in vitro [18, 63].
The interaction between tripolymer THBS1 and latent
TGF-beta 1 causes a conformational change in the latent
complex and exposes epitopes that are critical for binding
to the cellular receptor. Our data show that THBS1 and
TGF-beta 1 is expressed and secreted by mesenchymallike melanoma cells and further, that THBS1 is inducible
in epithelial-like cells upon exposure to TGF-beta 1.
The interplay between these molecules supports a role
for positive feedback within the tumor and extends the
observations of others that TGF-beta 1 induces EMT
in melanoma [21, 31] and that THBS1 is a TGF-beta 1
activator [18]. We propose that THBS1 promotes EMT in
melanoma through activation of latent TGF-beta 1 during
the progression of melanoma.

Finally we demonstrate a striking association
between the expression of THBS1 and drug resistance,
not only to cytotoxic drugs, but also in melanoma cells
resistant to BRAF inhibition. The list of genetic and
non-genetic changes that are associated with resistance
to the targeted MAPK inhibitors continues to grow and
our data adds to this with the clear demonstration that
THBS1 can play a functional role in BRAF inhibitor
resistance. Although a direct mechanism cannot readily
be implied from an understanding of its various biological
specificities, an indirect role can readily be explained via
TGF-beta-induced EMT, or through association with the
LRC phenotype. Slow cycling cells have recently been
associated with BRAF inhibitor-resistance and melanoma
invasiveness [13]. In our studies THBS1 expression in
LRC was associated with an EMT-like phenotype and
potentially implicates TGF-beta pathway activation in
LRC to mediate tumor progression. These findings contrast
with those of Roesch et al., who did not identify EMT
possibly explained by differences in the experimental
systems utilized. Nonetheless it is clear that further studies
of LRC, THBS1 and the role of TGF-beta signaling will be
critical to better understand heterogeneity, plasticity and
the mediators of phenotype switching as contributors to
treatment failure. As a central player in these processes,
THBS1 well may serve as a target in strategies to better
treat malignant melanoma.

Gene-expression arrays and data analysis
RNA was analysed on Illumina HT-12 v3 arrays
at the Australia Genome Research Facility (AGRF,
Australia). Raw data were read in to the R environment
for statistical computing (http://www.r-project.org/) using
the limma package [64], background was corrected using
the normexp function, and log2 transformed and quantile
normalized. Differential expression for the cell line panel
was determined using the ANOVA tool in Partek Genomics
Suite (Partek GS). Differential expression for the smaller
label-retaining data set employed the RankProd package
for differential expression analysis, using a percentage of
false positive (PFP – approximation of false discovery rate
(FDR)) cut-off of 5% to determine statistical significance
[65]. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) settings were;
gene set permutation, a FDR of 5%, and the MSigDB 4.0
database (category C2). Lists of differentially expressed
genes were used to create network diagrams in STRING
[66], with connections between molecules based on
different levels of molecular interaction evidence, such as
known physical interaction, correlated gene expression,
and literature mining. Microarray data from Nazarian R
et al. were obtained from NCBI GEO (accession
GSE24862). Affymetrix CEL files were normalized by
RMA [67] in Partek GS. Principal components analysis
and hierarchical clustering of all datasets were performed
in Partek GS, with hierarchical clustering using average
linkage and Pearson’s dissimilarity as a distance metric.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell culture
Melanoma cell lines were established from resected
melanoma metastases by mechanical dissociation of
tissue with subsequent overnight digestion in media
containing collagenase IV at 37°C. Established cell lines
were Mycoplasma-tested using the MycoAlert test (Lonza
Rockland, Inc., USA). All tissue donors provided written
informed consent for tissue collection and research, which
was covered by protocols approved by the Austin Health
Human Research Ethics Committee, Melbourne, Australia
(approval number H2012/04446). All cell lines were
matched with their donors by HLA-typing. Cells were
cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS) as described previously [22].

Solid phase ELISAs
THBS1 and TGF-beta 1 protein amount in cell
line supernatants was measured by Quantikine human
Thrombospondin 1 (R&D Systems, USA) or TGF-beta1
immunoassay kit (Life Technologies, USA) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.

qRT-PCR
RNA for qPCR was extracted using the RNEasy
kit (Qiagen, Germany) or the Acturus® RNA Picopure®
kit (Life Technologies, USA). Reverse transcription
was carried out using the High Capacity cDNA RT
kit (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, USA).
Following reverse transcription, qRT-PCR was
performed using SYBR Green (Qiagen, Germany). BetaActin (ActB) was used as internal control. Following

media containing 0.6mg/ml G418, with colonies isolated
using cloning cylinders (Merck, USA).

LM-MEL-42 and LM-MEL-34 was treated with
5ng/ml TGF-beta 1 (Pepro Tech Inc.,USA). RNA was
extracted 24, 48 and 72 hours following treatment.

THBS1 knockdown and immunofluorescence
For transient siRNA transfection, cells at 30%
confluence were transfected using a control siRNA and
two different Silencer select siRNAs targeting THBS1
(s14100 and s14098) at 20nM final concentration
(Ambion, USA) with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen,
USA). Cells were incubated with siRNA complex for
48 hours and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
stained with anti-THBS1 antibody (A6.1, NB100-2059,
Novus Biologicals, USA) was applied at 2.5μg/mL
concentration overnight at 4°C and with Alexa flour 488
conjugated secondary antibody for 45 minutes at room
temperature (Molecular probes, USA). Cells were counter
stained with DAPI for 10 minutes.

VybrantDye labeling
LM-MEL-44, LM-MEL-28, LM-MEL-33, LMMEL-34, LM-MEL-42 and LM-MEL53 were stained with
5μl of VybrantDye CM-Dil (Life technologies, USA) for
25min at 37°C/5% CO2.

Flow cytometry and sorting
Melanoma cell lines were stained with Pacific-Blue
(Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol and flow cytometry was performed using a
FACSCanto II. Cell sorting utilized a FACSAria III (all
Becton, Dickinson and Company, USA).

In vivo chick embryo model

Animal experiments

Melanoma cells were treated with THBS1-specific
siRNAs or scrambled control siRNA as described and
labelled with CM-DiO or Dil as per manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen, USA). Cells were grown
overnight in a hanging-drop fashion to allow the formation
of aggregates. Fertile chicken eggs were incubated at
38°C for 48 hours prior to transplantation. Cell aggregates
consisting of 50-400 cells were harvested and carefully
injected with a glass pipette into the trunk neural tube
lumen of developing chicken embryos. The eggs were
then sealed with adhesive tape and re-incubated for 2 days.
After incubation, embryos were removed from the eggs
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and whole mounts
or cross sections were analyzed for the localization of
melanoma cells using Lumar V12 Zeiss microscope.

Ethical approval was provided by the Austin
Health Animal Ethics Committee. Ascites cells from
the peritoneal fluid of a patient with advanced stage IV
melanoma were confirmed as melanoma by a pathologist
in the Austin Hospital. Red blood cells and debris were
removed with Ficoll-Plaque centrifugation. Cells were
stained with CM-Dil, resuspended in PBS and injected
subcutaneously in mice (n=3). Tumor growth was
monitored three times a week, and mice were sacrificed
after three weeks. Tumors were removed and paraffinembedded.

Invasion assay
Invasion assays were performed in Boyden
chamber inserts with Matrigel coating (Becton,
Dickinson and Company, USA). Insert membranes were
stained with 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or
a 0.1% crystal violet solution (Sigma, USA). Cells were
photographed with a monochromatic Olympus camera.
The total number of invaded cells was counted from
three representative fields of view per chamber, at 10×
magnification.

Treatment with chemotherapy agents
Melanoma cells were treated with cytotoxic
chemotherapy agents, such as Taxol (40nM), 5-Flourouracil
(150μM) or Cisplatin (1μM) or DMSO (all Sigma Aldrich
Pty Ltd., USA) for 72 hours.

Generation of PLX4720 resistant cell lines
LM-MEL-28 and LM-MEL-64 were grown in media
with 5μM or 1μM PLX4720 (Scientifix Pty Ltd, Australia)
for 10 weeks; media was exchanged every third day. Parental
cell lines treated with DMSO served as control. Cells for
RNA extraction were harvested at 80% confluency.

THBS1 over-expression construct
The plasmid encoding THBS1 was obtained
from Sino Biological Inc. Cells were transfected using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, USA). Stably
transfected cells were selected for and maintained in

Paraffin embedded tissue slides were deparaffinised
and rehydrated, endogenous peroxidise activity was
blocked with 3% Hydrogen peroxide, antigen retrieval
was performed in 10mmol/L citrate buffer, and nonspecific
binding was blocked with blocking reagent. THBS1
antibody (A6.1, NB100-2059, Novus Biologicals, USA)
was applied at 6μg/mL concentration and incubated
overnight at 4°C, followed by 60 minute incubation
with secondary anti-mouse antibody HRP (Dako). The
chromogen used was 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC).
Human placenta was used as the positive control for
THBS1 and a negative control, for which the primary
antibody was substituted with the same concentration
of mouse IgG. Slides were scanned using a ScanScope
XT (Aperio) and immunohistochemical reactivity
was evaluated by two independent investigators. The
expression of THBS1 was categorized into four grades.
They were arbitrarily scored as 3, strong staining; 2,
moderate staining; 1, weak staining and 0, no staining.
