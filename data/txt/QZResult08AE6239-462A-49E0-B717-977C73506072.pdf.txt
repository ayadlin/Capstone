Abstract
Prostate cancer chemoprevention is an alternative and
potential strategy to control this malignancy. Herein, we
evaluated the chemopreventive efficacy of grape seed extract
(GSE) against prostate cancer in transgenic adenocarcinoma of
the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice where animals were fed with
GSE by oral gavage at 200 mg/kg body weight dose during 4 to
28 weeks of age. Our results showed a significant reduction
(46%, P < 0.01) in the weight of genitourinary tract organs in the
GSE-fed mice. The GSE-fed group of mice had a higher
incidence of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia but showed
strong reduction in the incidence of adenocarcinoma compared with mice in control group. Prostate tissue from the GSE
group showed f50% (P < 0.001) decrease in proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA)–positive cells and 64% (P < 0.01)
reduction in total PCNA protein level compared with the
control group; however, GSE increased apoptotic cells by
8-fold. Furthermore, GSE strongly decreased the protein levels
of cyclin B1, cyclin A, and cyclin E by 84% (P < 0.05), 96%
(P < 0.05), and 89% (P < 0.001), respectively. The protein
expression of cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 6 and Cdc2 was
also decreased by more than 90% (P < 0.05) in the prostate from
the GSE-fed group. Together, for the first time, we identified
that oral GSE inhibits prostate cancer growth and progression
in TRAMP mice, which could be mediated via a strong
suppression of cell cycle progression and cell proliferation
and an increase in apoptosis. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5976–82]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in elderly
American men and second only to lung cancer in deaths (1).
According to the American Cancer Society, there would have been
an estimated 234,460 new prostate cancer cases and 27,350
associated deaths in 2006 in the United States alone. Lifestyle
and dietary habits have been identified as major risk factors in
prostate cancer growth and progression (2, 3). Epidemiologic data
indicate that vegetables and fruits with chemopreventive agents
could have protective effect against cancer (4). Management of
cancer by chemoprevention may not necessarily eliminate the
lesions; however, it is expected to delay the neoplastic progression

and that would certainly improve the morbidity and survival time
in prostate cancer patients (5, 6). In the last few years, considerable
progress has been made in this direction, which has led to the
identification of novel cancer chemopreventive agents and their
mode of action (7, 8). One such agent is grape seed extract (GSE),
which has shown promising chemopreventive and anticancer
effects in various cancer cells and animal tumor models (9–12).
GSE is a complex mixture of polyphenols containing dimers,
trimers, and other oligomers (procyanidins) of catechin and
epicatechin and their gallate derivatives together known as the
proanthocyanidins (13–15). GSE is marketed as a dietary
supplement in the United States, owing to several health benefits
mainly attributed to its antioxidant property (16–18). In addition,
studies conducted in our laboratory have shown that GSE inhibits
in vitro growth of hormone-refractory advanced human prostate
carcinoma DU145 cells by induction of apoptosis via caspase
activation (19), inhibition of constitutive as well as tumor necrosis
factor-a–induced nuclear factor-nB activation, and inhibition of
epidermal growth factor–induced or constitutive activation of
mitogenic signaling (20). Our studies have also shown that GSE
inhibits in vivo growth of DU145 xenograft in nude mice via an
inhibition of cell proliferation and an induction of apoptosis (21).
Additionally, we have also shown that GSE induces anoikis and
apoptosis in androgen-dependent human prostate carcinoma
LNCaP cells in culture (22). In the present study, for the first time,
we evaluated the chemopreventive efficacy of oral GSE against
prostate cancer growth and progression in the transgenic
adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model.
The TRAMP model has been developed in the inbred C57BL/6
strain of mice using the minimal rat probasin promoter to drive the
expression of SV40 early genes (T/t; Tag) specifically in the
prostatic epithelium (23, 24). The transgene is hormonally
regulated, expressed at sexual maturity, and induces spontaneous
neoplastic epithelial transformation (25). The SV40 large T antigen
abrogates p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) function and thus acts as
an oncoprotein. As a consequence, TRAMP males develop
spontaneous progressive stages of prostatic disease with time
from early lesions of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) of the
dorsolateral prostate to the late-stage metastatic adenocarcinoma
and thus mimic the progressive forms of human prostatic
carcinoma (26–29). Therefore, our present finding of antitumor
efficacy of GSE and associated mechanisms in TRAMP model could
have potential clinical significance.

GSE Inhibits Prostate Cancer Progression in TRAMP Mice
Animals, treatment, and necropsy. Heterozygous TRAMP females
developed on a pure C57BL/6 background were cross-bred with nontransgenic C57BL/6 breeder males and maintained in the Laboratory
Animal Care facility at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center,
Denver, CO. Mouse-tail DNA was isolated from the litter and subjected to
PCR-based screening assay as described previously by Greenberg et al.
(25). The routinely obtained 4-week-old TRAMP male mice were
randomly distributed into control and treatment groups (n = 20 mice
per group) and gavaged with sterile saline (control group) or GSE
(200 mg/kg body weight) in sterile saline, 5 days/wk for a period of
24 weeks. Animal care and treatments were in accordance with institutional guidelines and approved protocol. During the study, animals were
permitted free access to AIN-76A diet and drinking water. Body weights
were recorded weekly, and the animals were monitored daily for their
general health.
At 28 weeks of the age, animals were sacrificed by ketamine injection
(containing heparin). Each mouse was weighed, and the lower genitourinary
tract, including bladder, seminal vesicles, and prostate, was removed
en bloc. The genitourinary tract wet weight was recorded, and the
dorsolateral prostate was microdissected whenever possible (when a tumor
obscured the boundaries of the lobes, it was taken as such) and divided into

two portions. One portion of the dorsolateral prostate was snap-frozen and
stored at 80jC. The other portion was fixed overnight in 10% (v/v)
phosphate-buffered formalin and then transferred into 70% ethanol before
standard tissue processing. The fixed tissues were dehydrated in ascending
grades of ethanol, cleared in toluene, and embedded in paraffin wax.
Sections (5 Am) were cut with microtome and mounted on superfrost slides
(Fisher Scientific) coated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). Tissues
were processed and stained with H&E for routine histopathologic
evaluation. At the time of necropsy, the animals were also examined for
gross pathology, and any evidence of edema, abnormal organ size, or
appearance in non-target organs was also noted.
Immunohistochemical analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
expression. The paraffin-embedded sections (5-Am thick) were deparaffinized and stained using antibody against proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) followed by 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine staining, as previously described
(21). The primary antibody used was mouse monoclonal anti-PCNA
antibody IgG2a (1:250; DAKO), and the biotinylated secondary antibody
used was rabbit anti-mouse antibody IgG (1:200 in 10% normal rabbit
serum; DAKO). The proliferating cells were quantified by counting the
PCNA-positive cells and the total number of cells at 10 randomly selected
fields at 400 magnification. The proliferation index (per 400 microscopic

field) was determined as number of PCNA-positive cells  100 / total
number of cells.
In situ apoptosis detection by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick-end labeling staining. The paraffin-embedded 5-Amthick sections were used to identify apoptotic cells by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining
using Dead End Colorometric TUNEL System (Promega Corp.). The
apoptosis was evaluated by counting the positive cells (brown-stained
cells) as well as the total number of cells at 10 randomly selected fields at
400 magnification. The apoptotic index (per 400 microscopic field) was
calculated as number of apoptotic cells  100 / total number of cells.
Immunoblot analysis of tissue lysates. The dorsolateral prostate
samples dissected out from control and GSE-fed groups of mice were
homogenized in non-denaturing lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
0.3 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% NP40, 5 units/mL aprotinin]. Protein concentration in lysates was
determined using Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad
Laboratories) by the Lowry method. For immunoblot analyses, 50 to 80 Ag
of protein per lysate was denatured in 2 SDS-PAGE sample buffer and
subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% or 16% Tris-glycine gel as needed. The
separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane followed
by blocking with 5% nonfat milk powder (w/v) in TBS (10 mmol/L Tris,
100 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4jC. Membranes were
probed with different primary antibodies, including anti-cyclin A (sc-751),
anti-cyclin B1 (sc-245), anti-cyclin D1 (sc-718), anti-cyclin D3 (sc-182), anti–
cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2; sc-163), anti-Cdk4 (sc-749), anti-Cdk6
(sc-177), anti-Cdc2 (sc-54; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-cyclin E (Ab-1),
anti-Kip1/p27 (Neomarkers); and anti-Cip1/p21 (Upstate). The membranes
were then incubated with specific peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody, anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibody (Amersham Corp.) followed by detection using
enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham). To confirm equal protein
loading per lane, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with mouse
monoclonal anti-h-actin primary antibody (Sigma).
Statistical and microscopic analyses. All statistical analyses were
carried out with Sigma Stat software version 2.03 (Jandel Scientific). P < 0.05
was considered significant. m2 analysis was used to compare the incidence
of PIN and adenocarcinoma in control and GSE-fed groups. For other data,
the difference between control and GSE-fed groups was calculated by
Student’s t test. Densitometric analysis of the immunoblots (adjusted with
h-actin as the loading control) was done by Scion Image program (NIH,
Bethesda, MD). All the microscopic histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses were done by Zeiss Axioscope 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Inc.), and the photomicrographs were captured by Carl Zeiss AxioCam
MrC5 camera with the Axiovision Rel 4.5 software.

Results
GSE feeding reduces the weight of genitourinary tract in
TRAMP mice. Oral gavage feeding of GSE at 200 mg/kg body
weight, 5 days/wk from 4 to 28 weeks of age, did not show any
considerable change in diet consumption during 24 weeks of
treatment (data not shown). In addition, there was no considerable
difference in body weight (adjusted with genitourinary tract
weight) between control and GSE-fed mice (data not shown);
however, at necropsy, reduced size of genitourinary tract organs
was observed compared with those of the control group. At the
time of necropsy, all animals were examined for gross and
microscopic pathology, where necropsy did not show any evidence
of edema, abnormal organ size, or appearance in non-target organs.
There was a significant difference between the genitourinary tract
weight of control and GSE-fed group. The genitourinary tract
weight of the GSE-fed group was 52% (P < 0.01) lesser than that of
the control group (Fig. 1A). When the genitourinary tract weight

was normalized to body weight (Fig. 1B), the difference in weight
followed the same trend; the GSE-fed group of mice showed 46%
(P < 0.01) lesser genitourinary tract weight compared with control
mice. This finding clearly indicates the inhibitory effect of GSE on
abnormal growth of the prostate in TRAMP mice, which was also
examined by histopathologic analysis.
GSE feeding reduces the incidence of adenocarcinoma in
TRAMP mice. A detailed histopathologic analysis of the neoplastic
progression of the dorsolateral prostate in both control and GSEfed groups was done. H&E-stained sections (Fig. 1C) were
microscopically examined and classified (30) as (a) low-grade
PIN (LGPIN) having foci with two or more layers of atypical cells
with elongated hyper chromatic nuclei and intact gland profiles;
(b) high-grade PIN (HGPIN) having increased epithelial stratification, foci of atypical cells fill or almost fill the lumen of the ducts,
enlarged diameter of the glands, distorted duct profiles, increase in
nuclear pleomorphism, hyper chromatic nuclei, and cribriform
structures; (c) well-differentiated adenocarcinoma showing invasion of basement membrane, loss of intraductal spaces, and
increased quantity of small glands; (d) moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma showing total loss of intraductal spaces and
relatively solid growth; and (e) poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma showing sheets of poorly differentiated cells with remnants of

trapped glands. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was a difference in PIN
incidences between GSE-fed and control groups. In most animals,
the tumor progression was arrested at LGPIN stage in the GSE-fed
group compared with that in the control group (LGPIN incidence
50% versus 30%, respectively; P < 0.01); however, no difference was
noted in the incidence of HGPIN between the groups. The control
group exhibited features characteristic of microinvasive carcinoma
with penetration of PIN involved glands into the surrounding
stroma to form small nests of cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, there was a
50% reduction in the incidence of well-differentiated tumors in the
GSE-fed group together with a 60% reduction (P < 0.01) in the
incidence of undifferentiated (both moderately and poorly
differentiated) tumors (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that GSE
inhibits tumor progression in the neoplastic stage, thereby
reducing the incidence of adenocarcinoma, which is also supported
by an accumulation of prostatic tissue at LGPIN stage in GSE-fed
TRAMP compared with control mice.
GSE feeding reduces proliferation index in dorsolateral
prostate of TRAMP mice. To assess the in vivo effect of GSE
feeding on the proliferation index in dorsolateral prostate, the
tissue samples were analyzed by PCNA immunostaining. Qualitative microscopic examination of PCNA-stained sections showed a
substantial decrease in PCNA-positive cells in the prostate tissue
samples from GSE-fed mice compared with vehicle controls
(Fig. 3A and B). The quantification of PCNA staining showed
33 F 1.9% PCNA-positive cells in GSE-fed group compared with
65 F 2.6% PCNA-positive cells in controls (Fig. 3C), which clearly
shows that GSE feeding decreased proliferating cells by f50%
(P < 0.001) compared with control group. The negative controls,
in which PBS was used instead of PCNA, did not show any
considerable positive staining (data not shown). These results
were further confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the tissue
lysates for the PCNA protein, which showed lower levels in GSE-fed
group (Fig. 3D). The densitometric analysis of the bands (adjusted

with h-actin as the loading control) exhibited a 64% (P < 0.01)
decrease in PCNA protein expression in GSE-prostate tissue
samples compared with controls (Fig. 3D). These results suggest
the in vivo antiproliferative effect of oral GSE on dorsolateral
prostate in TRAMP mice.
GSE increases apoptosis in dorsolateral prostate of TRAMP
mice. In vivo apoptotic response of GSE feeding on prostate
tumorigenesis in TRAMP mice was investigated by TUNEL
staining. Microscopic examination of the tissue sections showed
an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells in GSE-fed group
(Fig. 4A and B). The number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in
the GSE-fed group was 22 F 1.2% compared with 3 F 0.2% in the
control group, accounting for f8-fold (P < 0.001) increase in
apoptotic cells (Fig. 4C). This finding suggests that in addition to
antiproliferative effect, proapoptotic effect could be another
potential mechanism underlying inhibitory effect of GSE in
prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP mice.
GSE modulates cell cycle regulators in inhibition of prostate
tumor progression in TRAMP mice. The GSE-caused decrease in
proliferation index in the mouse prostate prompted us to
investigate its effect on cell cycle regulatory molecules. Immunoblot analysis of the prostate tissue lysates showed that GSE downregulates the expression of mitotic cyclins A, B, and E (Fig. 5). A
summary of the densitometric analysis of the data (adjusted with
h-actin as the loading control) is shown in Fig. 5. In the GSE-fed
group, the expression of cyclin B1 and cyclin A was decreased by
84% and 96%, respectively (P < 0.05, for both; Fig. 5). Similarly,
cyclin E protein level was also decreased by 89% (P < 0.001) in the
GSE-fed group (Fig. 5). There was, however, no change in the
protein levels of cyclin D1 and D3 in both the groups; in fact, there
was only a faint expression of the D type cyclins in both the groups
(data not shown).
Because cyclins act as the regulatory subunits that mediate the
activation of the Cdks, we also examined the expression levels of

different Cdk molecules in the prostate tissue lysates. GSE feeding
strongly decreased the protein levels of Cdk2, Cdk6, and Cdc2 in
the TRAMP mice (Fig. 5). We did not observe any significant
difference in the expression of Cdk4 in control versus GSE-fed
groups, which can be attributed to a large degree of variability
(>50%) in the expression levels of Cdk4 in the individual prostate
samples within the control group (Fig. 5). The expression levels of
Cdk2, Cdk6, and Cdc2 (Fig. 5) were decreased by 96%, 99%, and
94%, respectively ( for each, P < 0.05). However, we did not observe
any significant difference in the expression levels of Cdk inhibitors
Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27 between both the groups (Fig. 5). Together,
these results indicate that GSE strongly decreases the expression of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

The novel finding in the present study is that oral consumption
of GSE, a commonly used dietary supplement, inhibits prostate
tumor progression in TRAMP, a mouse model in which the course
of prostate tumorigenesis closely mimics the human form of this
malignancy. This antitumor efficacy of GSE was associated with its
antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect in prostate tumor tissue.
Furthermore, for the first time, we also identified that GSE strongly
decreases the in vivo expression of cyclins and Cdks, which are
known to regulate the checkpoints during cell cycle progression.
Therefore, we anticipate that cyclins and Cdks could constitute
potential molecular targets in the inhibition of prostate tumor
progression by GSE.
Although most organs regress with age, prostate grows leading
to prostatic hypertrophy in elderly men (31–33). A percentage of
these could develop carcinoma of the prostate, which has become
the biggest killer of elderly men due to cancers in United States (1).
However, the onset is gradual, and most men fail to realize that
anything is wrong with their prostate; therefore, many of them
battle on and accept the progressive reduction in their quality of
life as simply a part of aging until other complications eventually
supervene. The socioeconomic implications of this disease are
considerable, and with the trend towards increasing life span, the
statistics will increase in the future (34). Recently, there have been
considerable activities directed toward the identification of dietary
components for both prevention and intervention of cancer,
including prostate cancer (7, 8). This is supported by the present
study, wherein GSE showed strong preventive efficacy against
prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP mice. Oral GSE also showed a
significant reduction in the weight of genitourinary tract organs
including prostate.
The TRAMP model is an autochthonous transgenic mouse
model for prostate cancer in which the minimal rat probasin
promoter drives the expression of SV40 early genes (T/t; Tag),
specifically in the prostatic epithelium. The transgene is hormonally and developmentally regulated and induces spontaneous
neoplastic epithelial transformation in the prostate of the
transgenic mice (23–25, 27, 28). In humans, prostate cancer
progression is a multistage process involving the onset as a small
carcinoma of low histologic grade progressing slowly to metastatic
lesions of higher grade. Prostate cancer in the TRAMP model
mimics this human type of prostate cancer progression events in a
stochastic fashion (26, 29). In the present study, GSE-fed mice
showed a higher incidence of PIN with a concomitant reduction in
the incidence of adenocarcinoma. This suggests that GSE feeding
for 24 weeks starting from the 4th week of age causes suppression
of the tumor progression in the neoplastic stage, thereby reducing
the incidence of adenocarcinoma. Both immunohistochemical and
immunoblot analyses for PCNA revealed that GSE feeding
significantly decreases cell proliferation in the dorsolateral
prostate, which was also accompanied by an increase in apoptotic
cell death. Furthermore, it was anticipated that antiproliferative
effect of GSE against prostate tumor progression might involve cell
cycle regulatory mechanisms.
An aberrant regulation of cell cycle has been an underlying cause
of the uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival leading to the

Figure 5. GSE feeding alters the
expression levels of cell cycle regulatory
molecules in the prostate of TRAMP mice.
Four prostate tissue samples from
individual mice were randomly selected
from each group for immunoblot analyses
detailed in Materials and Methods.
Reactive protein bands for the expression
of cyclin B1, cyclin A, cyclin E, Cdc2,
Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, Cip1/p21, and
Kip1/p27 were visualized by enhanced

membrane was stripped and probed with
h-actin as loading control. Densitometric
analysis of band intensity for each protein

neoplastic transformation and cancer progression (35). Cell cycle
progression is regulated by the activity of Cdks in association with
their regulatory subunits, cyclins, and Cdk inhibitors (36).
Activation of different Cdks is specific to the distinct phases of
the cell cycle; for example, the association of Cdk4/Cdk6 with
D-type cyclins regulates the early and mid-G1 phase progression,
whereas Cdk2-cyclin E for late-G1 and G1-S transition, Cdk2-cyclin A
for S phase progression, and Cdc2 (or Cdk1)-cyclin B1 for G2-M
phase transition (37). The changing patterns of cyclins and Cdks
have been characterized during the progression of prostate cancer
in the TRAMP model (38), wherein an up-regulation of mitotic
cyclins, including cyclin A, B, and E, and a concomitant decrease in
cyclin D1 have been observed during the progression of cancer.
However, the expression levels of cyclin D3, although they increase
compared with normal prostate, do not vary much during the
disease progression (38). In the present study, GSE down-regulated
the expression of cyclins E, A, and B1 as well as Cdk2, Cdk6, and
Cdc2 in the prostate of TRAMP mice. A slight increase, although not
significant, in the protein expression of Cdk inhibitors Cip1/p21 and
Kip1/p27 was also observed by the GSE treatment. Therefore, it is
more likely that GSE could inhibit aberrant cell cycle progression
through late G1 and G1-S transition as well as G2-M transition in the
prostate of TRAMP mouse. This cell cycle inhibitory effect of GSE
was complemented by its strong inhibitory effect on cell
proliferation as observed by PCNA analysis. Additionally, it could
be also possible that chronically arrested cells in cell cycle can
undergo apoptosis as observed by the GSE treatment.
The present in vivo findings are supported by our cell culture
studies where a polyphenolic fraction isolated from grape seeds is

found to decrease both Cdks and cyclins protein levels together
with inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death of human
prostate carcinoma DU145 cells (39). Furthermore, gallic acid,
recently isolated and identified by us as an active agent in GSE (14),
has also shown its cell cycle arrest and apoptotic effects in DU145
cells via a decrease in Cdks and cyclins protein levels as well as an
inactivating phosphorylation of cdc25A/cdc25C-cdc2 via ataxia
telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM)/checkpoint kinase-2 (Chk2)
activation (40). Our other studies with GSE or GSE fractions have
also shown strong apoptotic effects in DU145 cells (19, 39–41),
involving dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation as well as ATM-p53
activation in LNCaP cells (22). Many of these in vitro findings are yet
to be investigated in vivo for the anti–prostate cancer effects of GSE.
Studies in the TRAMP model with other chemopreventive
agents, such as green tea (also rich in catechins/epicatechins and
their gallate esters), have shown inhibition of progression of
prostate cancer via modulation of insulin-like growth factor
receptor signaling pathway and apoptosis induction (42). Genistein, the primary isoflavone from soy, has been shown to reduce the
incidence of poorly differentiated tumors in TRAMP mice by downregulation of specific sex steroid receptor and growth factor
signaling pathways (43, 44). Whereas more studies are needed in
future to assess whether the anti–prostate cancer efficacy of GSE
also involves similar molecular changes as observed with green tea
and genistein, to our knowledge, this is the first study in the
TRAMP model with strong prostate cancer chemopreventive
efficacy of GSE involving the modulation of cell cycle regulatory
molecules.

In summary, GSE feeding inhibits prostate tumor growth as well
as progression in TRAMP mice without any adverse health effects.
At molecular level, GSE decreased the expression of cyclins and
Cdks, thereby arresting cell cycle progression that was accompanied by the decreased cell proliferation and an enhanced apoptosis.
Therefore, it could be suggested that cyclins and Cdks are potential
in vivo molecular targets for GSE efficacy in arresting the tumor
grade at an earlier stage during prostate tumor progression in the
TRAMP mice. Findings in the present study together with our
earlier findings in human prostate tumor xenograft in athymic
