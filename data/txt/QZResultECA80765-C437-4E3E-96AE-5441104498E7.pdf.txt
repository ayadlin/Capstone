Abstract
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a role in controlling malignant cellular growth. mTOR
inhibitors, including rapamycin (sirolimus), are currently being evaluated in cancer trials. However, a
signiﬁcant number of tumors are rapamycin resistant. In this study, we report that the ability of rapamycin
to downregulate Skp2, a subunit of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex, identiﬁes tumors that are sensitive
to rapamycin. RNA interference (RNAi)–mediated silencing of Skp2 in human tumor cells increased their
sensitivity to rapamycin in vitro and inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. Our ﬁndings suggest
that Skp2 levels are a key determinant of antitumor responses to mTOR inhibitors, highlighting a potentially
important pharmacogenomic marker to predict sensitivity to rapamycin as well as Skp2 silencing strategies
for therapeutic purposes. Cancer Res; 72(7); 1836–43. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Dysregulated cell-cycle progression is a hallmark of cancer.
Cell-cycle progression is normally regulated by the ubiquitinmediated proteolysis of key regulatory proteins including the
cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (1). The
anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and the Skp1-Cul1-F-box
(SCF) complex are the 2 main classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases.
Skp2 is an F-box protein that constitutes the substrate recognition subunit of the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase complex and is
the rate-limiting component required for the turnover of
proteins involved in cell-cycle control such as the CDK inhibitor p27 (2). Skp2 is considered to be a proto-oncogene as Skp2
overexpression causes increased proliferation, invasion, and
inhibits apoptosis (3–5). Many clinical studies have indicated
that upregulation of Skp2 and loss of p27 are common in
malignant tumors and are associated with poor prognosis (6).
The mechanisms that regulate Skp2 protein levels remain
controversial. Rodier and colleagues showed that phosphorylation of Skp2 on Ser-64 and Ser-72 increases its stability (7).
Moreover, Lin and colleagues and Gao and colleagues observed
that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Skp2 at Ser-72 impairs
its degradation and relocalizes it to the cytosol contributing to
its oncogenic function (8, 9). More recently, conﬂicting reports

from Boutonnet and colleagues and Bashir and colleagues
showed that phosphorylation of Skp2 on Ser-72 does not
control Skp2 binding to Skp1 and Cul1, has no inﬂuence on
SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase activity, and does not affect its subcellular localization (10, 11) but do not dispute its phosphorylation by Akt at Ser-72. Interestingly, it has been shown that
Akt phosphorylates CDK2 regulating its cellular localization,
which is required for cell-cycle progression (12). At the transcriptional level, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
pathway regulates Skp2 through E2F1 binding to its promoter
(13, 14). This ﬁnding implies a positive feedback loop composed of Skp2, p27, cyclinE-CDK2, and Rb-E2F termed the Skp2
autoinduction loop that promotes progression through the
restriction point (15, 16).
The serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a central role in controlling cell growth (17).
mTOR exists in 2 complexes. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)
regulates protein translation via modulation of S6K1 and
4EBP1, and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) regulates cell survival
via phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473, which is necessary for
full activation of Akt, along with PDK1 phosphorylation of
Thr308 (18). The immunosuppressant drug rapamycin, when
bound to the FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12), inhibits the
kinase activity of mTORC1 and signiﬁcantly reduces the kinase
activity of the CDK4/cyclin D and CDK2/cyclin E complexes by
increasing the CDK inhibitor p27 leading to cell-cycle arrest at
G1 (19, 20). The FKBP12–rapamycin complex does not bind to
mTORC2, however, prolonged rapamycin treatment suppresses the assembly of mTORC2 and its ability to activate
Akt in a cell-type–speciﬁc manner (21). In many cell lines,
active mTORC1 suppresses PI3K activity by a negative feedback loop mediated by S6K1. Inhibition of mTORC1 release
this inhibitory feedback loop resulting in increased Akt
activity (22).
Because mTOR activation is common in cancers, we investigated the role of Skp2 in the response of tumor cells to the

Rapamycin Resistance and Defective Regulation of Skp2

mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Here, we show that Skp2 is downregulated upon rapamycin treatment in rapamycin-sensitive
human tumor cells, whereas Skp2 expression was not affected
in rapamycin-resistant tumor cells. Moreover, when tumor
xenografts derived from rapamycin-resistant cells were treated
with rapamycin, the tumor volume was signiﬁcantly increased.
Silencing Skp2 in rapamycin-resistant tumor cells using short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) was sufﬁcient to increase the sensitivity
to rapamycin and to inhibit the growth of tumor xenografts.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Reagents were obtained from the following sources: Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM), RPMI, and
McCoy's from Invitrogen; FK12 from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC); FBS from Atlanta Biologicals; rapamycin
from Biovision; LY294002 from VWR; and NVP-BEZ235 was a
gift from Dr. Deng Shi-Xian (Columbia University, NY). Skp2shRNA and negative control shRNA (scrambled sequence)
vectors were obtained from SuperArray Bioscience Corporation. Antibodies to phospho-Ser-473, phospho-Thr-308 Akt,
Akt (all 3 Akt-directed antibodies recognize the 3 known Akt
isoforms), and glyceraldehyde–3–phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) from Cell Signaling Technologies; Skp2 from Santa
Cruz; and anti-Flag from Sigma.
Cell lines and culture
Cell lines were obtained from the ATCC [authenticated and
characterized by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, karyotyping, COI testing, and are contamination free]. Cells were
cultured in the following media: BC3H1, RR1, and RR3 in
DMEM with 20% FBS. U937, LNCaP, and T47D in RPMI with
10% FBS; HeLa in DMEM with 10% FBS; PC3 in Fk12 with 10%
FBS; MDA-MB-231 in McCoy's with 10% FBS; all of the cell lines
were passaged less than 6 months and cultured at a density
that allowed cell division throughout the course of the
experiment.
Cell lysis and immunoblotting
Cells growing in 10-cm diameter dishes were rinsed once
with cold PBS and lysed for 20 minutes in ice-cold buffer A [40
mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 120 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
10 mmol/L pyrophosphate, 10 mmol/L glycerophosphate, 50
mmol/L NaF, 0.5 mmol/L orthovanadate, and EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche)] containing 0.3% CHAPS. After clearing of the lysates by centrifugation at 13,000  g for 10 minutes,
samples containing 50 mg of protein were resolved by SDSPAGE and proteins transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
and visualized by immunoblotting using infrared-labeled secondary antibodies (1:10,000, LI-COR Biosystems). Band intensities were quantiﬁed with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System (LI-COR Biosciences).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA (0.5 mg) was used to synthesize cDNAs using the
Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase
(NE Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's speciﬁcations.

www.aacrjournals.org

Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out using a LightCycler
1.5 (Roche) with the LightCycler Taqman Master mix. For Skp2,
we used universal probe # 50 with 50 -GGTGCTCTGGGTTTTCTGAAT forward primer and 50 -AAGTCAAAGCACCAGGAGAGA reverse primer, for p27 universal probe # 62 with 50 GAGCAGTGTCCAGGGATGAG forward primer and 50 TCTGTTGGCCCTTTTGTTTT reverse primer, and for GAPDH
universal probe # 9 with 50 -agcttgtcatcaacgggaag forward
primer and 50 -tttgatgttagtggggtctcg reverse primer.
Expression vectors and stable transfection
The coding regions of human Skp2 were ampliﬁed by PCR
using the forward primer 50 -CTGAAGCTTATGCACAGGAAGCACCTCCAG and the reverse primer 50 -CTAGAATTCTCATAGACAACTGGGCTTTTGCAGTG that contain HindIII
and EcoRI, respectively, and cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV-10
(Sigma). The Ser-64 and Ser-72 mutations (DD-Skp2) were
generated by Quickchange II XL site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the following primers: S64D-forward
50 -GGGCCACCCGGAGGACCCCCCA-CGGAAA, S64d-reverse
50 -TTTCCGTGGGGGGTCCTCCGGGTGGCCC, S72D-forward
50 -CCACGGAAACGGCTGAAGGACAAAGGGAGTGACAAAGA,
and S72D-reverse 5 0 -TCTTTGTCACTCCCTTTGTCCTTCAGCCGTTTCCGTGG. Vectors were transfected into the cells
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected with
0.8 mg/mL G418 (Invitrogen).
Tumor xenografts
PC3 cell lines stably expressing wild-type Skp2 or the
empty vector, or HeLa cells stably transfected with Skp2speciﬁc sh-RNA or with empty vector were xenografted into
6-week-old immunodeﬁcient mice (Ncr nu/nu mice; Harlan
Laboratories). All animal studies were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia
University Medical Center. PC3 cells (3  106) or HeLa cells
(5  106) were injected subcutaneously in the upper ﬂank
region of mice that had been anaesthetized with isoﬂurane.
Mice were treated with rapamycin (10 mg/kg) or with NVPBEZ235 (30 mg/kg in 10% NMP:90% PEG, given per os in
100 mL of volume) as described (23). At completion of all
xenograft studies mice were sacriﬁced, the tumors were
excised and tumor volumes estimated with the following
formula: volume ¼ (a2  b)/2, where a ¼ short and b ¼ long
tumor lengths, respectively, in millimeters.

Results and Discussion
Rapamycin resistance correlates with increased Skp2
and decrease in p27
The potential role of Skp2 in the response of tumor cells
to the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, was investigated by comparing Skp2 protein levels in a rapamycin-sensitive murine cell
line, BC3H1, derived from a mouse brain tumor, and 2 rapamycin-resistant BC3H1 clonal cell lines (RR1 and RR3) developed in our laboratory (24). Rapamycin inhibited cell growth in
the BC3H1 cells but not in RR1 or RR3 cells (Fig. 1A). Skp2
protein and mRNA levels were low in rapamycin-sensitive
BC3H1 cells, and rapamycin treatment or serum starvation

resulted in a further reduction (Fig. 1B and C). In contrast, in
RR1 and RR3 cells, Skp2 protein and mRNA levels were elevated
more than 2-fold than the parental BC3H1 cells and were
unchanged by rapamycin treatment or serum starvation (Fig.
1B and C). Moreover, Skp2 protein levels were inversely correlated with p27 protein levels (Fig. 1B and C). These data are
consistent with previous reports of decreased p27 levels in RR
cells (24) and may suggest that low levels of p27 protein might
be due to increased Skp2 expression. The increase in Skp2 at
the transcriptional level is consistent with previous data
showing persistent retinoblastoma (Rb) hyperphosphorylation
in RR cells (24), releasing the transcription factor E2F (13). In
addition, downregulation of p27, which activates CDK2 in RR
cells, may increase the stability of Skp2 at the protein level by
phosphorylating it at the conserved S64 site (7).
Rapamycin resistance is associated with defective
regulation of Skp2 in human tumor cell lines
We next tested whether Skp2 and p27 protein levels correlated with the response of 6 different human tumor cell lines to
rapamycin. Cells that were resistant to rapamycin (HeLa,
MDA-MB-231, LNCaP; Fig. 2A) expressed high levels of Skp2
(both protein and mRNA) that was not affected by rapamycin
treatment (Fig. 2B and C). Conversely, rapamycin-sensitive
cells (U937, T47D, PC3; Fig. 2A) exhibited approximately 2-fold
decrease in Skp2 protein levels and approximately 1.5-fold
decrease in Skp2 mRNA levels upon rapamycin treatment (Fig.
2B and C). Notably, p27 and Skp2 protein levels were inversely
correlated (Fig. 2B). These data agree with previous reports
that low p27 and high Skp2 levels are associated with more
aggressive tumors (25) and indicate that impaired downregu-

lation of Skp2 by rapamycin correlates with rapamycin
resistance.
Dephosphorylation of Skp2 and Akt correlates with
human tumor cell line sensitivity to rapamycin
In addition to the transcriptional dysregulation of Skp2 in
rapamycin-resistant cells, aberrant regulation of Skp2 protein
stability may also play a critical role in determining rapamycin
sensitivity. Phosphorylation of Skp2 at Ser-64 and Ser-72 by
CDK2 and Akt, respectively, were shown to increase Skp2
stability by interfering with its association with Cdh1 (7–9).
Because prolonged rapamycin treatment (24 hours) inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of Akt in certain tumor
cells (21), we hypothesized that cell lines with rapamycinsensitive Akt phosphorylation would have low amounts of
Skp2 after rapamycin treatment. Indeed, cell lines with rapamycin-sensitive Akt phosphorylation (U937, PC3, T47D) exhibited decreased Skp2 protein levels upon rapamycin treatment (Fig. 3A). In contrast, cell lines with rapamycin-insensitive Akt phosphorylation (LNCaP, HeLa, and MDA-MB-231)
showed no change in Skp2 levels upon rapamycin treatment
(Fig. 3A).
To test the effect of Akt on Skp2 expression, we treated the
same tumor cell lines with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or the
dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR, NVP-BEZ235 (26). LNCaP,
HeLa, and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with LY294002 or NVPBEZ235 exhibited inhibition of Ser-473-Akt phosphorylation
and approximately 2-fold decrease in Skp2 expression (Fig. 3B
and C). Moreover, the decrease in Skp2 expression correlated
with the increased sensitivity of cells to LY294002 or NVPBEZ235 (Fig. 3D). In addition, treatment of these cells with the

Rapamycin Resistance and Defective Regulation of Skp2

Downregulation of Skp2 by rapamycin is
phosphorylation dependent
Recent reports have suggested that phosphorylation of Skp2
at Ser-64 and/or Ser-72 by CDK2 and/or Akt increases its
stability (7–9). Because both CDK and Akt are downstream
of mTOR, we tested whether the downregulation of Skp2 in
the rapamycin-sensitive cells is phosphorylation dependent.
We therefore replaced both Ser-64 and Ser-72 with the
phosphomimetic amino acid aspartic acid using a ﬂag-tagged
Skp2 expressing plasmid (DD-Skp2). Upon rapamycin treatment, the rapamycin-sensitive cells (PC3, T47D) downregulated the endogenous Skp2 and the WT-Flag-Skp2 but not the
DD-Flag-Skp2 (Fig. 4A and B). The downregulation of Skp2
correlated with the rapamycin sensitive decrease in Akt phosphorylation. Interestingly, rapamycin-resistant cells (HeLa),
showed no change in the expression levels of the endogenous
Skp2, the WT-Flag-Skp2, or the DD-Flag-Skp2 upon rapamycin
treatment and correlated with the rapamycin-insensitive Akt
phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). These data show that dephosphorylation of Skp2 at Ser-64 and/or Ser-72 is critical for Skp2
downregulation by rapamycin.

dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor increased the expression of p27
(Fig. 3C). These data show a direct correlation between the
degree of Akt phosphorylation, Skp2 protein levels, and the
cellular response to rapamyicin, LY294002, and to the dual
inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. These data are supported by Sarbassov
and colleagues who showed that tumor xenografts of PC3 cells
stably transfected with S473D-Akt but not wild-type Akt were
resistant to rapamycin-induced decrease in tumor size (21).

Skp2 determines tumor xenograft sensitivity to
rapamycin
We further investigated the biologic signiﬁcance of Skp2
expression on the cellular response to rapamycin, by ectopically overexpressing WT-Flag-Skp2 in rapamycin-sensitive
cells (PC3). Stably transfected PC3 cells with WT-Flag-Skp2
exhibited reduced sensitivity to rapamycin (Fig. 5A and B).
To determine the role of Skp2 in the response of tumors to
rapamycin in vivo, control or WT-Flag-Skp2 stably transfected PC3 cells were xenografted onto nude mice. Rapamycin inhibited the growth of tumors derived from control
PC3 cells by 85%, whereas tumors derived from WT-FlagSkp2 overexpressing PC3 cells were relatively resistant to
rapamycin exhibiting less than 50% reduction in tumor
growth (Fig. 5C and D).
Silencing the endogenous Skp2 using Skp2-speciﬁc shRNA in
rapamycin-resistant cells (HeLa) increased the expression of
p27 compared with control cells by more than 2-fold (Fig. 6A).
When treated with rapamycin, sh-SKp2–transfected cells
showed a further increase in the expression of p27 whereas
control cells showed a slight decrease (Fig. 6A). Moreover,
HeLa cells transfected with sh-Skp2 had a reduced proliferation rate and exhibited increased sensitivity to rapamycin (Fig.
6B and C). These data are in agreement with previous reports
showing that mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) derived from
Skp2/ embryos and other organs from Skp2/ mice exhibited increased levels of p27 protein, indicating that Skp2
regulates p27 protein degradation. Moreover, Skp2/ MEFs
proliferate slowly in culture (27). Notably, tumor xenografts of
Hela cells stably transfected with sh-control vector exhibited a
2-fold increase in tumor size upon rapamycin treatment (Fig.
6D). These data are in agreement with reports of acceleration
in tumor growth after the use of mTOR inhibitors, which may
be due to the release of the negative feedback loop by rapamycin (28).

Remarkably, tumor xenografts of HeLa cells stably transfected with Skp2-shRNA (designed to mimic the low Skp2
expression and low phospho-Ser-473-Akt response of sensitive cells to rapamycin) exhibited more than 90% inhibition
of tumor growth (Fig. 6D). However, when tumor xenografts
of HeLa cells transfected with Skp2-shRNA were treated with
rapamycin, which increased phospho-Ser-473-Akt, tumor
growth was increased by approximately 4-fold compared
with nontreated HeLa cells transfected with Skp2-shRNA
(Fig. 6D). We used the dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor to test
whether the detrimental effect of rapamycin observed in
these tumors is due to rapamycin insensitive Akt. HeLa cells
transfected with Skp2-shRNA or with sh-control exhibited
approximately 80% inhibition of tumor growth compared

1840

Cancer Res; 72(7) April 1, 2012

with nontreated HeLa cells transfected with sh-control upon
treatment with the dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor NVPBEZ235.
The existence of the negative feedback loop downstream of
mTORC1 may contribute to rapamycin resistance observed in
HeLa cells. Therefore, when the dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor
was used, it exhibited greater antiproliferative effect and
reduction in tumor volume compared with that of rapamycin
(Figs. 3D and 6D). Moreover, these data show that targeting
Skp2 alone is sufﬁcient to inhibit the growth of a tumor derived
from rapamycin-insensitive Akt in mouse xenografts. However,
the combination of rapamycin with Skp2 inhibitors would not
have a beneﬁcial effect in tumors that have rapamycin-insensitive Akt phosphorylation.

Rapamycin Resistance and Defective Regulation of Skp2

Figure 4. Downregulation of Skp2 by rapamycin is phosphorylation dependent. A to C, indicated cells stably expressing empty vector (EV), wild-type Flag-Skp2
(WT), or DD Flag-Skp2 (DD) were treated with DMSO or 100 nmol/L rapamycin (Rap) for 24 hours, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting
for the indicated proteins and phosphorylation states. Bar graphs indicate the quantiﬁcation of the levels of endogenous Skp2 (Endo) and the Flag-Skp2. Data
are presented as means  SD (n ¼ 3).  , compared with DMSO-treated cells (P < 0.01).

Our data are in agreement with recent reports showing that
the combined knockout of Skp2 and Pten in mice inhibits the
tumor formation which was observed in Pten-knockout mice
(29), although tumors with PTEN loss are particularly susceptible to mTOR inhibitors (30). However, PTEN loss alone is
neither necessary nor sufﬁcient to result in rapamycin-sensitive regulation of Akt phosphorylation (21). In fact, in the

present study we chose 2 prostate cancer cell lines that do
not express PTEN, the PC3 cells are sensitive to rapamycin
whereas LNCaP are resistant, and of the 2 breast cancer cell
lines, both of which express PTEN, the T47D cells were
sensitive whereas MDA-MB-231 cells were resistant.
The present study examined whether Skp2 levels can be used
to determine the response of tumors to mTOR inhibitors. We

propose that rapamycin treatment is effective primarily in
tumors that exhibit rapamycin-sensitive dephosphorylation of
Akt at Ser-473 and consequently decreased Skp2 expression.
Upon validation in the clinical setting, Skp2 expression levels
could serve as a marker for predicting the response of tumors
to mTOR inhibitors. For tumors resistant to mTOR inhibitors
in which rapamycin fails to inhibit or increases Ser-473 phosphorylation of Akt, targeting Skp2 might be a therapeutic
alternative.
