Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The immune system plays key roles in determining the fate of developing cancers by not only
functioning as a tumour promoter facilitating cellular transformation, promoting tumour growth
and sculpting tumour cell immunogenicity1–6, but also as an extrinsic tumour suppressor that
either destroys developing tumours or restrains their expansion1,2,7. Yet clinically apparent
cancers still arise in immunocompetent individuals in part as a consequence of cancer induced
immunosuppression. In many individuals, immunosuppression is mediated by Cytotoxic TLymphocyte Associated Antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Death-1 (PD-1), two
immunomodulatory receptors expressed on T cells8,9. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) based
therapies targeting CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 (checkpoint blockade) have yielded significant clinical
benefits—including durable responses—to patients with different malignancies10–13. However,
little is known about the identity of the tumour antigens that function as the targets of T cells
activated by checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and whether these antigens can be used to
generate vaccines that are highly tumour-specific. Herein, we use genomics and bioinformatics
approaches to identify tumour-specific mutant proteins as a major class of T cell rejection antigens
following αPD-1 and/or αCTLA-4 therapy of mice bearing progressively growing sarcomas and
show that therapeutic synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccines incorporating these mutant epitopes
induce tumour rejection comparably to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Whereas, mutant
tumour antigen-specific T cells are present in progressively growing tumours, they are reactivated
following treatment with αPD-1- and/or αCTLA-4 and display some overlapping but mostly
treatment-specific transcriptional profiles rendering them capable of mediating tumour rejection.
These results reveal that tumour-specific mutant antigens (TSMA) are not only important targets
of checkpoint blockade therapy but also can be used to develop personalized cancer-specific
vaccines and to probe the mechanistic underpinnings of different checkpoint blockade treatments.

In this study, we used two distinct progressor MCA sarcoma cell lines (d42m1-T3 and F244)
and asked whether they expressed sufficient immunogenicity to be controlled by checkpoint
blockade immunotherapy. Both sarcoma lines were rejected in wild type (WT) mice treated
therapeutically with αPD-1- and/or αCTLA-4 (Fig. 1a). Rejection was immunologic since it
(a) was ablated by administration of mAbs that either deplete CD4+ or CD8+ cells or
neutralize IFN-γ; (b) did not occur in Rag2−/− mice lacking T, B, and NKT cells or Batf3−/−
mice lacking CD8α+/CD103+ dendritic cells required for tumour antigen cross-presentation
to CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1a); and (c) induced a memory response that protected
mice against rechallenge with the same tumour cells that had been injected into naïve mice
(Extended Data Fig. 1b,c).
Based on our previous success using genomics approaches to identify TSMA responsible for
the spontaneous rejection of highly immunogenic, unedited MCA sarcomas14, we asked
whether a similar approach could identify antigens responsible for αPD-1-mediated

rejection of d42m1-T3 progressor tumours. To increase the robustness and accuracy of our
epitope predictions, we modified our method as follows: (1) mutation calls from cDNA
Capture Sequencing14 were translated to corresponding protein sequences, pipelined through
three MHC class I epitope-binding algorithms and a median binding affinity calculated for
each predicted epitope; (2) epitopes were prioritized based on predicted median binding
affinities; and (3) filters were applied to the prioritized epitope list to (a) eliminate those
predicted to be poorly processed by the immunoproteasome and (b) deprioritize those from
hypothetical proteins or those that displayed lower binding affinity to class I than their
corresponding WT sequences. Using this approach, many epitopes were predicted for H-2Db
(49,677 9- and 10-mer epitopes) (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and H-2Kb (44,215 8- and 9-mer
epitopes) (Fig. 1b) based on the 2,796 non-synonymous mutations expressed in d42m1T314. Focussing on epitopes with the highest predicted binding affinity to H-2Db or H-2Kb,
we narrowed the list down to four H-2Db-binding epitopes (Extended Data Fig. 2b) and 62
H-2Kb-binding epitopes (Fig. 1c). Applying the aforementioned filters eliminated two
predicted strong-binding H-2Db epitopes (Extended Data Fig. 2c) and 20 predicted strongbinding H-2Kb epitopes (Fig. 1d) (epitope binding affinity distributions to different class I
alleles are distict15). Based on the resulting in silico generated epitope landscape, two
predominant H-2Kb restricted mutant epitopes were identified by their predicted binding
affinities: an A506T mutation (ITYAWTRL→ITYTWTRL) in Asparagine-linked
glycosylation 8 (alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase) (Alg8) and a G1254V mutation
(GGFNFRTL→VGFNFRTL) in Laminin alpha subunit 4 (Lama4). Based on H-2Kb
consensus binding, the mutations that produce these epitopes occur at positions p4 (Alg8)
and p1 (Lama4). Neither functions as an anchor residue for H-2Kb (these occur at p5 and
p8). The mAlg8 and mLama4 epitopes are predicted to bind 1.2- and 12.8-fold stronger to
H-2Kb respectively compared to WT sequences.

To identify which of the predicted d42m1-T3 neoepitopes functioned as targets for CD8+ T
cells in αPD-1 treated, tumour bearing mice, freshly explanted CD8+ TILs were isolated just
prior to tumour rejection (d11) and stained with fluorescently labelled H-2Kb or H-2Db
tetramers loaded with their corresponding strong-binding 66 predicted mutant epitopes. The
only tetramer-positive T cells consistently identified in the CD8+ TIL population were those
reacting with mLama4-H-2Kb tetramers (13.1% of CD8+ TILs in experiment shown; 15.6 ±
2.7% as the mean of 6 experiments) or mAlg8-H-2Kb tetramers (4.2% of CD8+ TILs in
experiment shown; 2.8 ± 1.1% as the mean of 6 experiments) (Fig. 1e and Extended Data
Fig. 2d). Similar results were obtained when freshly explanted CD8+ TILs from the same
mice were co-cultured with naïve irradiated splenocytes pulsed with each of the 66 predicted
H-2Kb and H-2Db epitopes. The mLama4 and mAlg8 epitopes were, again, the only
significant hits, inducing IFN-γ and TNF-α production (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2e).
These results demonstrate that d42m1-T3 expresses two dominant TSMA epitopes for CD8+
T cells following αPD-1 immunotherapy.
To independently validate these observations, we established CD8+ T cell lines from spleens
of mice that had rejected d42m1-T3 tumours after αPD-1 treatment. These T cells produced
IFN-γ when co-cultured with d42m1-T3 but not F244 or other independent sarcoma lines.
Stimulation was restricted by H-2Kb but not H-2Db (Extended Data Fig. 3a) and the only

predicted epitopes that stimulated these T cell lines were mLama4 and mAlg8 (Extended
Data Fig. 3b) and not their WT forms (Extended Data Fig. 4a).

Four subsequent findings supported the conclusion that mLama4 and mAlg8 were the
relevant antigens responsible for αPD-1-induced rejection of d42m1-T3. First, mLama4 or
mAlg8 epitopes stabilized H-2Kb expression on RMA-S cells, which lack a functional
antigen transporter and thus fail to stably express MHC class I proteins on the cell surface
(Extended Data Fig. 4b). Second, both epitopes were detected by mass spectrometry (MS) in
eluates of affinity purified H-2Kb isolated from d42m1-T3 tumours. Using a discovery MS
approach, we identified mLama4 in the H-2Kb eluate (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and verified
its identity using an isotope-labelled synthetic mLama4 peptide (Extended Data Fig. 5b). We
also found more than 200 WT peptides associated with H-2Kb (Supplementary Table 1), but
we have no evidence that any of these function as d42m1-T3 antigens. Mutant Alg8,
wtLama4 and wtAlg8 peptides were not detected (Supplementary Table 1). In contrast,
using the more sensitive targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) MS method, both
mLama4 and mAlg8 peptides were identified in the H-2Kb eluate (Fig. 2a, Extended Data
Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 1). Notably, mLama4 and mAlg8 were the only predicted
strong-binding mutant epitopes found. Peptides from wtLama4 or wtAlg8 were not detected.
Neither mLama4 nor mAlg8 were detected in H-2Kb eluates from F244 cells (Extended
Data Fig. 6b). Third, as detected by staining with H-2Kb -mLama4 or -mAlg8 tetramers,
CD8+ T cells specific for either antigen accumulated temporally in d42m1-T3 tumours of
αPD-1 treated mice, reaching maximal values just prior to tumour rejection (Fig. 2b and
Extended Data Fig. 7a). No mLama4- or mAlg8-tetramer positive TILs were observed in
F244 sarcomas from αPD-1 treated mice. Fourth, the two H-2Kb-restricted epitopes induced
antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in naïve mice when injected together with poly I:C
(pIC) as assessed by ELISPOT (Fig. 2c).

Author Manuscript

Since mLama4- and mAlg8-specific T cells were linked to αPD-1-induced d42m1-T3
rejection we asked whether a therapeutic vaccine comprised of these antigens could protect
against tumour outgrowth. When 10-member groups of mice bearing established d42m1-T3
tumours were vaccinated with the combination of mLama4 (28-mer) and mAlg8 (21-mer)
SLPs with pIC, 9 rejected their tumours compared to control mice vaccinated with irrelevant
HPV (30-mer) SLP plus pIC (1/10 mice survived) or pIC alone (1/10 mice survived) (Fig.
2d and Extended Data Fig. 8a). In multiple experiments, mice vaccinated with mLama4 +
mAlg8 SLP + pIC displayed an 85% survival (17/20) while those treated with HPV SLP +
pIC or pIC alone showed 10% (2/20) and 15% (3/20) survival, respectively (Fig. 2e).
Prophylactic administration of the combined mLama4 and mAlg8 SLP vaccine induced 88%
survival (15/17) (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). The combined mLama4 and mAlg8 prophylactic
SLP vaccine induced superior protection compared to either SLP alone (Extended Data Fig.
8c) or compared to vaccines comprised of the minimal 8 amino acid epitopes (Extended
Data Fig. 8c). The d42m1-T3 specific vaccines did not prevent outgrowth of unrelated F244
sarcomas (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 8c). These results not only demonstrate that
mLama4 and mAlg8 are major antigenic targets that mediate checkpoint blockade-induced
rejection of d42m1-T3 tumours but also show that αPD-1 or therapeutic SLP vaccines
consisting of the TSMA targeted by αPD-1 are similarly efficacious.

Since the aforementioned analyses were conducted using αPD-1 treated mice bearing
d42m1-T3 tumours, we asked whether the presence of mLama4- and mAlg8-specific T cells
in the TIL population was dependent on checkpoint blockade therapy. T cells specific for
mLama4 or mAlg8 were detected in mice treated with control mAb or αPD-1 ± αCTLA-4
(Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 7b). The percentage and total number of mLama4- or
mAlg8-specific CD8+ TILs were similar in tumours from control mAb and αPD-1 treated
mice but were elevated in mice treated with either αCTLA-4 or αCTLA-4 + αPD-1.

The observation that mLama4- and mAlg8-specific T cells were found in tumours from mice
treated with either control mAb or checkpoint blockade mAbs prompted us to assess the
resultant changes in the TIL population following αPD-1 and/or αCTLA-4 treatment. We
used RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) to assess gene expression in freshly isolated, mLama4H-2Kb-tetramer+ TILs from groups of tumour bearing mice treated with control mAb,
αPD-1, αCTLA-4, or αPD-1 + αCTLA-4. Since mLama4-specific T cells were 7-times
more abundant in d42m1-T3 tumours than mAlg8-specific T cells in this series of
experiments, we restricted our analysis to the former. Only a subset of 25 genes was
commonly regulated (either up or down) by treatment with αPD-1 and/or αCTLA-4 (Fig. 3c
and Extended Data Table 1a). This group included a subset of genes whose enhanced
expression is similar to that observed in CD8+ T cells from mice during acute secondary
viral infection and depressed in a manner similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells in
chronic viral infection16 (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Table 1a, and Supplementary Table 2). In
contrast, antigen-specific CD8+ TILs isolated from αPD-1 and/or αCTLA-4 treated mice
displayed mostly treatment-specific alterations of non-overlapping sets of genes involved in
CD8+ T cell effector functions (Supplementary Table 2). The effects of checkpoint blockade
on gene expression were predominately observed on TSMA-specific T-cells and not in other
CD8+ TILs (Fig. 3d).

Author Manuscript

To determine which pathways were regulated by the different checkpoint blockade
therapies, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using canonical pathwayand immunological signature-databases. When compared to mLama4-specific TILs from
control mAb-treated mice, tumour antigen-specific TILs from mice treated with αPD-1
and/or αCTLA-4 displayed a common set of alterations involving effector function,
MAPK-, chemokine-, and cytokine receptor-signalling (Extended Data Table 1b and
Supplementary Table 3). In contrast, mLama4-specific TILs from mice treated with αPD-1,
αCTLA-4 or both mAbs displayed profound treatment-specific pathway alterations
(Extended Data Table 1b and Supplementary Table 3). Treatment with αPD-1 produced
metabolic changes including those involving oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis,
respiratory electron transport, TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathways, as well as in
pathways involved in IL-2 signalling. These cells also displayed a profile consistent with
response to type I IFN. Treatment with αCTLA-4 increased NFAT and JAK-STAT
signalling pathway activity, cellular proliferation/cell cycle, and activation of effector T
cells. Treatment with both αCTLA-4 and αPD-1 induced a synergistic pattern of metabolic
and effector T cell-specific functions including those involving T cell mediated anti-tumour
activity. This was reflected in the most significant enhancement of effector molecules such
as IFN-γ, Granzyme A, Granzyme B, and Fas ligand (Supplementary Table 2). Thus,
whereas blockade of different inhibitory costimulators leads to a common biological

outcome—tumour eradication—the precise mechanisms differ by which this outcome is
achieved.

Author Manuscript

We also assessed changes in expression of functionally relevant proteins on/in CD8+ TILs in
mice undergoing treatment with different checkpoint blocking mAbs. TILs specific for
mLama4 or mAlg8 from mice treated with αPD-1 and/or αCTLA-4 displayed lower cell
surface expression of Lymphocyte-Activation Gene 3 (LAG-3) and T Cell Immunoglobulin
and Mucin Protein 3 (TIM-3) than those in progressively growing tumours in control mAb
treated mice (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Elevated LAG-3 and TIM-3 expression
is known to mark antigen-experienced, dysfunctional (i.e., exhausted) CD8+ T cells16,17 in
chronic viral infection. Conversely, TILs specific for mLama4 or mAlg8 from αCTLA-4 or
αCTLA-4 + αPD-1 treated mice displayed significantly higher levels of Granzyme B than
antigen-specific TILs from mice treated with either αPD-1 alone or control mAb (Fig. 4b).
Consistent with the RNA-Seq analysis, these changes were observed predominantly in
antigen-specific TILs. In addition, whereas a low percentage of CD8+ TILs from mice
treated with control mAb produced IFN-γ and TNF-α (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9c),
the percentage of IFN-γ producing TILs increased following treatment of the mice with
αPD-1 and particularly with αCTLA-4 or the combination of αCTLA-4 + αPD-1. TILs
expressing both cytokines, which likely represent the most potent anti-tumour effectors,
were most highly represented following treatment of tumour bearing mice with the
combination of αCTLA-4 + αPD-1.

This report documents that TSMA are targets of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and
can be used in vaccines that therapeutically induce tumour rejection as effectively as
checkpoint blockade therapy. The ability to rapidly and accurately identify TSMA using
genomics and bioinformatics approaches18–20 and use them to generate MHC tetramers to
identify tumour-specific T cells provides a significant advantage to the fields of tumour
immunology and cancer immunotherapy. This approach has not only facilitated the
identification of the antigenic targets of T cells affected by checkpoint blockade therapy21
but also has provided insights into the molecular changes that occur within the tumour
antigen-specific T cell population that give rise to the anti-tumour effects of αPD-1 and/or
αCTLA-4. Our findings provide some of the first experimental support for the clinical
observations that (a) checkpoint blockade therapy amplifies, in some cases, pre-existing
anti-tumour T cell responses8,9,21,22; (b) whereas αCTLA-4 treatment eliminates Tregs,
promotes T cell priming, and renders the host more susceptible to autoimmunity13,22,23;
αPD-1 promotes T cell activation acting as a rheostat of immune effector function9,22,24,25;
and (c) dual blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 is particularly effective in promoting enhanced
anti-tumour effector functions10,22,26.

The mutational loads of the MCA sarcomas used in this study are high and similar to those
of UV- and carcinogen-induced human cancers. For these types of tumours, it is likely that
TSMA vaccines targeting multiple antigens will be possible thereby providing better
coverage of the tumour cell population in part due to dealing more effectively with tumour
heterogeneity27,28. Additionally, the combination of a TSMA vaccine and checkpoint
blockade may facilitate the immune system’s ability to recognize less immunogenic TSMA
as well as shared, tumour-associated antigens (TAA) via mechanisms that mimic epitope-

spreading29. However, recent studies have shown that human tumours containing far fewer
mutations (e.g., 26 mutations) can be sensitive to TSMA based immunotherapy even for
tumor specific antigens that are targets for class II restricted CD4+ T cells30. Our study thus
provides a strong argument to actively pursue the use of TSMA as targets for cancer
immunotherapy; as a means to identify patients who would best benefit from such therapy;
and as components of MHC tetramers that can be used to identify tumour-specific T cells as
biomarkers of successful anti-tumour responses.

METHODS
Mice

Author Manuscript

Wild type and Rag2−/− mice were purchased from Taconic Farms. Batf3−/− mice31 on a
129S6 background were provided by K.M. Murphy and were bred in our specific pathogenfree animal facility. All in vivo experiments used 8–12 week old male, 129S6 background
mice (to match the sex and strain of the tumours) housed in our specific pathogen-free
animal facility. All studies were performed in accordance with procedures approved by the
AAALAC accredited Animal Studies Committee of Washington University in St. Louis.
Tumour transplantation

Author Manuscript

MCA-induced sarcomas used in this study were generated in male 129S6 strain wild type or
Rag2−/− mice and were banked as low-passage tumour cells as previously described1. All
cell lines used in this study were tested for mycoplasma. Tumour cells derived from frozen
stocks and propagated in vitro in RPMI media (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% FCS
(Hyclone) were washed extensively, resuspended at a density of 6.67 x 106 cells ml−1 in
endotoxin-free PBS and then 150 μl injected subcutaneously into the flanks of recipient
mice. Tumour cells were >90% viable at the time of injection as assessed by trypan blue
exclusion. Tumour growth was quantified by caliper measurements and expressed as the
average of two perpendicular diameters. Tumour growth measurements were performed
blinded. Sample size was chosen based on extensive previous work with this animal model.
No randomization was used. For antibody depletion studies, 250 μg of control mAb (PIP),
anti-CD4 (GK1.5) or anti CD8α (YTS169.4) was injected intraperitoneally into mice at day
–1 and every 7 days thereafter.
MHC class I epitope prediction

Author Manuscript

All missense mutations for d42m1-T3 were analysed for the potential to form MHC class I
epitopes that bind to either H-2Db or H-2Kb molecules. The Stabilized Matrix Method
(SMM) algorithm32, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm33, and the NetMHCpan
algorithm34 provided by the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (http://
www.immuneepitope.org) was used to predict epitope processing and binding affinities and
the results were ultimately expressed as affinity values (1/IC50 × 100). The median affinity
value was calculated by taking the median of the predicted affinity values from SMM, ANN,
and NetMHCpan algorithms. For the prediction of epitope processing, the NetChop
algorithm35 available from http://www.immuneepitope.org was used and potential epitopes
were filtered with those with a NetChop score of 0.6 or higher being prioritized. Filters were
also applied to eliminate mutations occurring in hypothetical Riken proteins and to de-

prioritize mutations resulting in affinity values that were less than that predicted for the wild
type sequence.
Antibodies

Author Manuscript

Anti-H-2Kb (B8-24-3) and anti-H-2Db (B22/249) antibodies were provided by T. H. Hansen
(Washington University School of Medicine). Anti-PD-1 (rat chimeric murine IgG1 clone
4H2) and anti-CTLA-4 (murine IgG2b clone 9D9) antibodies were provided by A.J.
Korman (Bristol-Myers Squibb). Isotype control antibodies (mouse IgG2a OKT3 and mouse
IgG1 GIR-208) were purchased from Bio X Cell and Leinco Technologies, respectively.
Anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD8α (YTS169.4), anti-IFN-γ (H22) monoclonal antibodies and
control immunoglobulin (PIP, a monoclonal antibody specific for bacterial glutathione Stransferase) were produced from hybridoma supernatants and purified in endotoxin-free
form by Protein G affinity chromatography (Leinco Technologies). Fluorescently
conjugated antibodies to CD3ε, CD4, CD8, CD45, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD-1, IFN-γ, and TNF-α
were purchased from BioLegend. For tetramer staining, an antibody to CD8 was purchased
from Accurate Chemical (clone CT-CD8α) as recommended for use with tetramer staining
by the NIH Tetramer Core Facility at Emory. Fc block (anti-CD16/32) was purchased from
BD Bioscience.
Peptides

Author Manuscript

All 8-, 9-, and 10-mer peptides were purchased from Peptide 2.0. All peptides were HPLC
purified to > 95% purity. Peptides for vaccine experiments were synthesized at ISA
Therapeutics B.V. The peptides were synthesized using solid phase Fmoc/tBu chemistry on
a PTI Prelude peptide synthesizer and purified on a Gilson preparative HPLC system to >
95% purity. The identity and purity of the peptides for vaccine experiments were confirmed
with UPLC-MS on a Waters Acquity UPLC/TQD system.
Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy
Tumour cells were subcutaneously transplanted into mice at 1 x 106 cells in 150 μl into the
flank. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with 200 μg anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4, used
alone or in combination on days 3, 6, and 9 post-tumour transplant. For controls, mice were
injected with 200 μg each of IgG2a and IgG1 isotype control antibodies.
Generation of CTL lines

Author Manuscript

To generate the d42m1-T3-specific CTL lines, wild-type mice were injected with 1×106
d42m1-T3 tumour cells and treated with αPD-1 that induced tumour rejection. Alternatively,
wild-type mice were injected with 1×106 d42m1-T3 tumour cells and were not treated with
αPD-1 leading to formation of progressively growing tumours that were then surgically
resected. Fifty days later, these mice were subsequently rechallenged with 1×106 d42m1-T3
tumour cells, which then rejected. In the case of either protocol, spleens from independent
mice that rejected the tumour were harvested two weeks after rejection and CTL lines were
established by stimulating 40×106 splenocytes with 2×106 d42m1-T3 tumour cells pretreated for 48 h with 100 U ml−1 of recombinant murine IFN-γ and then irradiated (100 Gy).
Cultures were stimulated two more times with irradiated, IFN-γ stimulated tumour cells plus

irradiated splenocytes and then CD8+ T cells were purified using magnetic beads (Miltenyi
Biotec).
Peptide binding assay
The peptide-MHC class I binding assay with RMA-S cells36 was performed by incubating
RMA-S cells with serial dilutions of peptides for 24 h. Cells were stained with mAbs to
H-2Kb and H-2Db followed by secondary PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (BD
Biosciences) and analysed by flow cytometry.
Tetramers

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

For determining kinetics of mLama4- or mAlg8-specific T cell infiltration into tumours,
H-2Kb tetramers conjugated to PE were prepared with mutant Lama4 or Alg8 peptides and
produced by the NIH Tetramer Core Facility (Emory University). For screening H-2Kb or
H-2Db predicted epitopes, we generated peptide-MHC Class I complexes in house. The
peptide-MHC class I complexes refolded with a UV-cleavable conditional ligand were
prepared as described with modifications37. Briefly, recombinant H-2Kb and H-2Db heavy
chains and human β2 microglobulin light chain were produced in Escherichia coli, isolated
as inclusion bodies, and dissolved in 4M urea, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0. MHC Class I refolding
reactions were performed by dialyzing a molar ratio of heavy chain: light chain: peptide of
1:1:8 against 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 for 48 h. The UV-cleavable peptide
SIINFEJL used to refold H-2Kb was purchased from Peptide 2.0. Refolded peptide-MHC
class I complexes were captured by ion exchange (HiTrap Q HP, GE), biotinylated, and
purified by gel filtration FPLC. UV-induced ligand exchange and combinatorial encoding of
MHC Class I multimers was performed as described38, except that the peptide-MHC
multimers used for flow cytometry staining were prepared by the addition of titrated
amounts of streptavidin-fluorochrome in a 10 μL format39.
Measurement of IFN-γ production

Author Manuscript

To generate target cells, tumour cells were treated with 100 U ml−1 IFN-γ for 48 h and
irradiated with 100 Gy before use. CTL cells (20,000 cells) were co-cultured with tumour
target cells (20,000 cells) in 96-well round-bottomed plates for 48 h in a total volume of 200
μl. For peptide stimulation of CTL lines, 100,000 naïve irradiated (30 Gy) splenocytes were
pulsed with various 8- or 9-mer peptides at 37° C for 1 h. Splenocytes were washed and
20,000 CTLs were added and the culture was incubated for 48 h. IFN-γ in supernatants was
quantified using an IFN-γ ELISA kit (eBioscience). For blocking assays, 25 μg ml−1 of antiH-2Kb (B8-24-3) or anti-H-2Db (B22/249) were added to the target cells (tumours) for 1 h
prior to addition of CTL cells. For IFN-γ ELISPOT, pre-coated 96-well PVDF filtration
plates (Millipore) were washed with PBS and conditioned with medium containing 10%
FCS. Erythrocyte-free single-cell suspensions from the spleen were added in triplicate and
incubated for 20 h with 1 μM mutant or wild type peptide. After extensive washes, 1 μg
ml−1 biotinylated detection antibody was added. Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) (Moss Substrates)
were subsequently used for colour development. Plates were scanned and analysed on an
ImmunoSpot reader (C.T.L.). Reagents for ELISPOT were purchased from Mabtech.

Tumour and spleen harvest

Author Manuscript

Established tumours were excised from mice, minced and treated with 1 mg ml−1 type IA
collagenase (Sigma) in HBSS (Hyclone) for 1 h at 37 °C. Spleens were also harvested,
crushed and vigorously resuspended to make single-cell suspensions. To remove aggregates
and clumps, cells were filtered through a 40-micron strainer.
CD8+ TIL peptide restimulation

Author Manuscript

Cells from tumours were enriched for CD8+ cells using Miltenyi mouse CD8+ enrichment
kit by following manufacturer’s protocol. Splenocytes harvested from naïve mice were
labelled with CFSE and irradiated at 30 Gy. 100,000 labelled irradiated splenocytes were
then pulsed with 1 μM of peptide and 100,000 CD8+ TILs were subsequently added and
incubated at 37 °C. After 1 h, BD GolgiPlug (BD Bioscience) was added and cells were
incubated for an additional 4 h. Surface staining was performed and cells were then fixed
and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit. Cells were then stained for IFN-γ and
TNF-α.
Isolation of H-2Kb presented peptides

Author Manuscript

For H-2Kb isolation, sarcoma cell lines d42m1-T3 and F244 were each expanded to 5 x 108
cells. Prior to harvesting, cells were stimulated with 300 U ml−1 IFN-γ for 48 hours to
increase MHC expression. Detachment of cells was facilitated by incubation with 100 U
ml−1 Collagenase IV (Gibco) in PBS for 10 min at 37° C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were
washed twice with PBS and cell pellets were subsequently snap frozen. MHC class I
molecules were isolated as previously described40. In brief, cell pellets were taken up in 1
ml of lysis buffer (1.2% CHAPS (Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany), 1x Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (Roche) in PBS) and homogenized by sonication. Lysates were cleared from
remaining cell debris by centrifugation (2,500g, 30 min) and passing through a 0.2 μm filter
(Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). MHC class I molecules were isolated by immunoaffinity
purification using H-2Kb-specific antibody Y3 covalently coupled to cyanogen bromideactivated sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). MHC molecules were eluted with 0.2%
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and released peptides were further isolated by ultrafiltration
through centricons with a 10 kDa cut-off membrane (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany).
Prior to LC-MS analysis peptides were desalted using C18 Zip Tips (Millipore) according to
manufacturer’s instructions and volumes were adjusted by vacuum centrifugation.
Identification of H-2Kb peptides by discovery MS

Author Manuscript

For the discovery mass spectrometry41, mass spectrometry analysis was performed on an
LTQ OrbitrapXL hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
equipped with a nanoelectron spray ion source coupled to a reverse-phase liquid
chromatography UHPLC system (Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA). Samples were injected onto a 75 μm x 2 cm trapping column (Acclaim PapMap
RSLC, Dionex) at a flow rate of 4 μl min−1 for 5.75 min. Peptides were then separated on a
50 μm x 50 cm separation column (Acclaim PapMap RSLC, Dionex) at 50°C in a column
oven with a flow rate of 175 nl min−1 and a gradient ranging from 2.5 to 32% Acetonitrile
over 140 min. Data dependent acquisition was enabled using a top five method (the five

most abundant ions with charges of 2+ or 3+ were selected for fragmentation during each
scan cycle). Survey scans were performed in the orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 and a
mass range of 350–600 m z−1. Peptides were fragmented and analysed in the ion trap using
collision-induced dissociation (CID, normalized collision energy 35%, activation time 30
ms, isolation width, 2 m z−1). Doubly charged masses for mLama4 and mAlg8 were
prioritized for fragmentation using an inclusion list.

Author Manuscript

Data processing was performed with Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (Thermo Fisher) and Mascot
search engine (Mascot 2.2.04, Matrix Science). Peak lists were searched against swissprot
mus musculus database (exported September 10th 2013, 16,633 reviewed protein sequences)
extended with the 62 mutated H-2Kb candidate sequences. Search restrictions were 5 ppm
precursor mass tolerance and 0.5 Da fragment mass tolerance with no enzymatic cleavage
specificity selected. Percolator algorithm was used to evaluate false discovery rate with a
target value of 0.05 (5% FDR). Additional post processing filters were an ion score ≥ 20,
search engine rank 1 and peptide length between 8 and 12 amino acids.
Identification of H-2Kb peptides by targeted SRM

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To generate the SRM42 assay library, the synthetic peptides were first analysed on an AB
Sciex QTRAP 5500 mass spectrometer in SRM-triggered MS2 mode. Peptides (PEPotec
SRM Grade 2) were synthesized by Thermo Fischer Scientific GmbH (Ulm, Germany). 51
of the 62 strong binding H-2Kb peptides were selected for analysis because they had
physiochemical properties that would allow their detection by MS if present.
Chromatographic separations of peptides were performed by a nanoLC ultra 2Dplus system
(Eksigent) coupled to a 15 cm fused silica emitter, 75 μm inner diameter, packed with a
Magic C18 AQ 5 μm resin (Michrom BioResources). Peptides were loaded on the column
from a cooled (4°C) nanoLC-AS2 autosampler (Eksigent) and separated in 60 minutes by a
linear gradient of acetonitrile (5 – 35%) and water, containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow
rate of 300 nl min−1. The mass spectrometer was operated in SRM mode, triggering
acquisition of a full fragment ion spectrum upon detection of an SRM trace (threshold 1000
ion counts). SRM acquisition was performed with Q1 and Q3 operated at unit resolution (0.7
m z−1 half maximum peak width) with a dwell time of 20 ms for each transition. For each
peptide the first fragment ion of the y-series with an m z−1 above the m z−1 precursor + 20
Thomson (Th), for the doubly charged peptide precursors, were used as triggering
transitions. MS/MS spectra were acquired in enhanced product ion mode, using quadrupole
(q2) fragmentation, low Q1 resolution, scan speed 10000 Da s−1, and an m z−1 range of
250–1000. Collision energies (CEs) were calculated according to the formulas: CE = 0.044 x
m z−1 precursor + 5.5 for doubly charged precursor ions. Raw data files (wiff) were
converted into mzXML format using msConvert from ProteoWizard (version 1.6.1455).
Qtrap MS2 spectra were assigned to peptide sequences using the SEQUEST algorithm and
PeptideProphet. The software Skyline43 was used to generate a spectral library from the
Qtrap mzXML files. Optimal SRM transition conditions (collision energy and fragment ion
selection) were determined for individual peptides as previously described by using
synthetic peptides44. Retention times were extracted from the spectra and converted into a
system-independent retention time (iRT) using spiked-in calibration peptides (Biognosys)45.
For each target mutant peptides, a heavy isotope-labelled reference peptides was spiked in

the H-2Kb peptide mixture for identification. For each peptide, three to seven transitions
were monitored for the heavy and light version and the resulting SRM data were visualized
and analysed manually by using the software Skyline. The unequivocal detection of mutant
MHC Class I H-2Kb-associated peptides was achieved by comparing three properties
between the reference heavy isotope-labelled peptide and its endogenous version: (a) their
retention time must be consistent, (b) they must trigger all SRM transitions concurrently and
(c) SRM transitions must be in the correct abundance hierarchy.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis

Author Manuscript

For flow cytometry, cells were stained for 5 min at room temperature with 500 ng of Fc
block (anti-CD16/32) and then stained with 200 ng of antibodies to CD45, CD4 or CD8α in
100 μl of staining buffer (PBS with 2% FCS and 0.05% NaN3 (Sigma)) for 20 min at 4 °C.
Propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma) was added at 1 μg ml−1 immediately before FACS analysis.
For tetramer staining, cells were stained for 5 min at room temperature with 500 ng of Fc
block (anti-CD16/32). Cells were then stained with anti-CD8 antibody (clone CT-CD8α
from Accurate Chemical) for 20 min at 4 °C at a 1:100 dilution. Antibodies to CD45 and
CD3ε along with H-2Kb tetramers conjugated to PE were then added at a concentration of
1:100 for 30 min at 4 °C. For intracellular cytokine staining of tumour infiltrating
lymphocytes, cells were isolated incubated for 5 hours with GolgiPlug (BD bioscience).
Cells were then harvested, washed, stained with anti-CD3ε and CD8α for 15 min, and then
fixed and permeabilized with BD fixation and permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences). Cells
with then stained with anti-IFN-γ or anti-TNF-α. For sorting of mLama4-specific cells,
tumour-infiltrating cells were enriched for CD45+ cells using CD45 cell purification
magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). CD45 enriched cells were then sorted gating for PI−
CD3ε+ CD8α+ mLama4-tetramer-PE+ or PI− CD3ε+ CD8α+ mLama4-tetramer-PE− cells.
Sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria II (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were pelleted
and processed for RNA analysis. The purity of the sorted cells for input RNA was greater
than 90% as assessed during post-sort cellular analysis. All flow cytometry was performed
on the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) or LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and analysed
using FlowJo software (TreeStar).

Vaccination

Author Manuscript

Mice were vaccinated s.c. with 50 μg peptides corresponding to mLama4 or mAlg8 in
combination with 100 μg poly I:C (Sigma-Aldrich). For SLP, the mLama4 peptide sequence
used was QKISFFDGFEVGFNFRTLQPNGLLFYYT (epitope underlined) and the mAlg8
peptide sequence used was AVGITYTWTRLYASVLTGSLV (epitope underlined). Two
weeks later spleens were harvested and splenocytes were restimulated with wild type or
mutant Lama4 or Alg8 8-mer peptides. Cells were then collected for ELISPOT analysis. For
prophylactic vaccination, mice were subcutaneously injected with 50 μg of peptides
corresponding to mLama4 or mAlg8, used alone or in combination, along with 100 μg of
poly I:C in a total volume of 200 μl diluted in HBSS on day -10, -3, and +4 post-tumour
transplant. d42m1-T3 tumour cells were transplanted at 1x106 tumour cells on day 0. As
controls, mice were immunized with either HBSS alone, poly I:C alone or a long peptide
vaccine corresponding to human papilloma virus (HPV) with poly I:C. Therapeutic
vaccination experiments were performed in identical manner except vaccines were

as mouse death or tumour size of 20 mm.
RNA sequencing

Author Manuscript

The purity of the sorted cell preparations were greater than 90% as assessed by post-sort
cellular analysis. mRNA was extracted from cell lysates using oligo-dT beads (Invitrogen).
For cDNA synthesis, we used custom oligo-dT primers with a barcode and adapter-linker
sequence (CCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT—XXXXXXXX-T15). After first strand
synthesis, samples were pooled together based on Actb qPCR values and RNA-DNA
hybrids were degraded using consecutive acid-alkali treatment. Then, a second sequencing
linker (AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTG) was ligated using T4 ligase (NEB) followed
by SPRI clean-up. The mixture then was enriched by 16 cycles of PCR and SPRI purified to
yield final strand specific RNA-seq libraries. The libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500
instrument using 50bpX25bp pair-end sequencing. Second read-mate was used for sample
demultiplexing, at which point individual single-end fastqs files were aligned to mm9
genome using STAR aligner with the following options --runThreadN 8 -outFilterMultimapNmax 15 --outFilterMismatchNmax 6 --outReadsUnmapped Fastx -outSAMstrandField intronMotif --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate. Gene expression
was quantitated using ht-seq and differentially expressed genes were defined using DESeq2
R package at p value <0.01. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using canonical
pathway- and immunological signature-databases was performed as previously described46.
