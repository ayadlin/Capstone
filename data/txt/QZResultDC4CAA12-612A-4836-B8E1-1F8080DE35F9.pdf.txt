Abstract
The proapoptotic protein Noxa, a member of the BH3-only Bcl-2 protein family, can effectively induce
apoptosis in cancer cells, although the relevant regulatory pathways have been obscure. Previous studies of the
cytotoxic effects of a-tocopheryl succinate (a-TOS) on cancer cells identified a mechanism whereby a-TOS
caused apoptosis requiring the Noxa-Bak axis. In the present study, ab initio analysis revealed a conserved FoxObinding site (DBE; DAF-16 binding element) in the NOXA promoter, and specific affinity of FoxO proteins to this
DBE was confirmed by fluorescence anisotropy. FoxO1 and FoxO3a proteins accumulated in the nucleus of
a-TOS–treated cells, and the drug-induced specific FoxO1 association with the NOXA promoter and its
activation were validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Using siRNA knockdown, a specific role for
the FoxO1 protein in activating NOXA transcription in cancer cells was identified. Furthermore, the proapoptotic
kinase Hippo/Mst1 was found to be strongly activated by a-TOS, and inhibiting Hippo/Mst1 by specific siRNA
prevented phosphorylation of FoxO1 and its nuclear translocation, thereby reducing levels of NOXA transcription and apoptosis in cancer cells exposed to a-TOS. Thus, we have demonstrated that anticancer drugs,
exemplified by a-TOS, induce apoptosis by a mechanism involving the Hippo/Mst1-FoxO1-Noxa pathway. We
propose that activation of this pathway provides a new paradigm for developing targeted cancer treatments.

Introduction
The total number of cells forming individual organs is
determined by the balanced act of cell proliferation and cell
death. For example, epithelial cells exhibit contact inhibition
arising from cell–cell and cell–substratum interactions (1).
However, tumors feature impaired mechanisms of contact
inhibition, resulting in rampant cell proliferation. Thus, specific reactivation of these control mechanisms in cancer cells
can promote inhibition of tumor progression associated with
induction of apoptosis.

The Hippo pathway controls organ size by inhibiting cell
proliferation, and mutations of its constituents result in
robust growth (2). The central mediator of the Hippo pathway
is the mammalian sterile 20-like kinase-1 (Mst1), a mammalian homolog of the Hippo kinase from Drosophila, which
promotes both proper exit from the cell cycle and apoptosis
during development (3–5). In Drosophila, the loss of Hippo
results in elevated transcription of cyclin E and the cell-death
inhibitor d-IAP1, an antagonist of caspases. The Hippo pathway regulates transcription by the coactivator Yorkie (6), a
homolog of the mammalian Yes-associated protein (YAP) and
the transcription coactivator with PDZ domain (TAZ), which
are sequestered by the 14-3-3 protein following their Hippodependent phosphorylation (7).
Evidence exists for another branch in the Hippo signaling
pathway, originally identified in nematodes. It has been
demonstrated that the Hippo/Mst1 kinase directly phosphorylates and activates the forkhead box proteins (FoxO), a
conserved group of transcription factors with the forkhead
DNA-binding domain (8). Under stress conditions, FoxO
causes expression of proapoptotic genes (9), including BIM
(10), FASL (11), and TRAIL (12). Expression of these genes has
been shown to be stimulated in conjunction with a decrease in
the Akt activity (13–15).
We have reported a-tocopheryl succinate (a-TOS) as a
cancer cell-selective apoptosis inducer, which involves ROS
accumulation followed by cell death (16, 17). Agents like
a-TOS, members of a class of redox-silent mitocans from

The Mst1-FoxO1 Pathway Controls Noxa Expression

the group of vitamin E (VE) analogues (18), have been reported
as potentially highly intriguing anticancer drugs because of
their greater specific activity for cancer cells (19–23). We have
discovered that the mechanism of ROS production by a-TOS
is based on displacement of ubiquinone from its site in the
mitochondrial complex II (24). Our recent work points to the
Bak channel being preferentially formed in cancer cells
exposed to a-TOS and we also show that this process is
modulated by Noxa, which is upregulated transcriptionally
in a p53-independent manner (25). To date, the signaling
pathway(s) causing transcriptional regulation of Noxa in
response to anticancer drugs such as a-TOS have not been
clarified.
In this communication, we describe the Hippo/Mst1FoxO1-Noxa axis as a novel signaling pathway that controls
apoptosis in cancer cells exposed to anticancer drugs. This
pathway links the early events in cancer cells exposed to
stressors like a-TOS and formation of a pore in the mitochondrial outer membrane, a hallmark of the intrinsic apoptotic
machinery essential for efficient killing of cancer cells and
tumor therapy by a host of different anticancer drugs.

Material and Methods
Cell culture
Jurkat T lymphoma cells and the p53/ H1299 non–small
cell lung cancer cells were grown in the RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with antibiotics and 10% FBS. Jurkat cells at 5 
105 cells per mL and the adherent H1299 cells at 70% to 80%
confluence were treated with a-TOS (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in EtOH. Control cells received corresponding volumes
of EtOH only (0.1%, v/v).
Databases
Sequences of the tested genes including the NOXA promoter
and the conserved DBE motif were obtained from Ensembl
(26). Predictions of the cis-regulating elements were carried
out using cis-RED (27).
Design of primers
All primers were designed using the GeneRunner software
(www.generunner.net/). The length of primers was between
18 and 23 nucleotides, the GC content was between 55% and
60%, and all primers were tested for secondary structure
presence to avoid interfering structures. The following primers were used for PCR analysis: NOXA, forward: TGT AGT

RT-PCR and PCR analysis
Harvested cells were lysed in 1 mL of the TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) and RNA was purified from the aqueous phase
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Quiagen). The purified RNA (0.5
mg) was used for reverse transcription employing the ProtoScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs).
One microliter of cDNA was used for PCR analysis, which was
performed using the PCR Master Mix (Promega) and the
following conditions: initial denaturation 95 C for 2 minutes;
cycles of 60 C for 30 seconds, 72 C for 30 seconds, and 95 C for
30 seconds; and the final extension at 72 C for 5 minutes.
Western blotting
Cells for the whole-cell analysis were washed with PBS and
lysed in RIPA buffer, nuclear and cytosolic fractions were
isolated using the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif). Protein
concentrations of individual samples were assessed using the
EZQ kit (Molecular Probes). Eighty micrograms of whole-cell
lysates, 30 mg of nuclear extracts, or 100 mg of cytosolic extract
were applied to SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis,
proteins were blotted onto PROTEAN nitrocellulose transfer
membranes (Sigma-Aldrich) using the Mini Trans-Blot Cell
(Bio-Rad). For immunostaining, membranes were blocked and
incubated with the primary antibody according to the manufacturer's protocol followed by incubation with a suitable
secondary HRP-labeled antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunodetection was conducted with the SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and the
MF-ChemiBIS bio-imaging system (DNR). The following antibodies were used: anti-Noxa IgG (Alexis), anti-FasL IgG
(Abcam), anti-TRAIL IgG (Abcam), anti-FoxO1 IgG, antiFoxO3a IgG, anti-phospho-Mst1 IgG (Thr183)/Mst2
(Thr180), anti-Mst1 IgG (all from Cell Signaling), anti-actin
IgG, anti-lamin B IgG (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
and anti-phospho FoxO IgG (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were used for the ChIP analysis: anti-FoxO1 IgG, antiGFP IgG (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FoxO3a
IgG (Abcam), anti-RNA Pol II (Active Motif), rabbit nonspecific
IgG (Active Motif), and anti-acetyl lysine IgG (Abcam).
Steady-state fluorescence and steady-state fluorescence
anisotropy DNA-binding measurements
Fluorescence spectra were recorded using the PerkinElmer
Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer at 22 C with 0.6
mmol/L protein and 0.6 mmol/L dsDNA in 50 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, and 1 mmol/L EDTA in a 10mm cell. The excitation wavelength was 336 nm, the bandwidths were 5 nm for both excitation and emission. The
following oligonucleotide containing the consensus FoxObinding sequence were used to prepare samples of dsDNA:
fluorescein (FLC)-labeled S1FLC, 5´-FLC-TTG GGT AAA CAA
G-3; and S2FLC, 50 -FLC-CTT GTT TAC CCA A-30 .
The steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorescence
spectrometer at 22 C with 100 nmol/L dsDNA labeled with
fluorescein at the 50 terminus of both strands (S1FLC/S2FLC).
Increasing amounts of the recombinant FoxO DBD were added
and the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein was

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed
using a ChIP kit with enzymatic shearing (Active Motif).
Briefly, nuclei isolated from 4  107 a-TOS–treated or control
Jurkat cells were sheared for 10 minutes using the Enzymatic
Shearing Cocktail, precleared by incubation with protein G
beads to reduce the nonspecific background (10 mL of precleared chromatin was saved as input) and incubated overnight at 4 C on a rotator with anti-FoxO1 IgG, anti-RNA Pol II
or anti-acetyl lysine antibody IgG and nonspecific rabbit IgG
or anti-GFP IgG as a negative control. In the next step, the
antibody complexes were precipitated by incubation with
protein G beads and after several washes eluted with the
solution of SDS and NaHCO3. The nucleoprotein complexes
were then de-cross-linked by an overnight incubation at 65 C
and treated with RNase A and proteinase K. The resulting DNA
molecules were purified using the DNA purification minicolumns, and 5 mL of purified DNA was used for PCR analysis

Transfection and siRNA experiments
FoxO1 and FoxO3a proteins were knocked down by transfecting Jurkat or H1299 cells with specific siRNAs (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) using the transfection reagent (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Protein levels were determined by Western blotting and
experiments performed following 72 hours of siRNA exposure.
The Mst1 protein was knocked down by transfection with 4
specific siRNAs (Thermo Scientific) into Jurkat cells employing the DharmaFECT 4 reagent (Thermo Scientific). In Jurkat
cells, NOXA mRNA levels were quantified 4 hours after a-TOS
addition and in the H1299 cells after a 6-hour exposure to the
drug.

The Mst1-FoxO1 Pathway Controls Noxa Expression

To assess the affinity of the DBE within the NOXA promoter for the forkhead box DNA-binding domain (DBD),
fluorescence anisotropy was measured using a fluorescently
labelled DNA sequence from the part of the NOXA promoter
carrying the DBE titrated with the recombinant DBD common to FoxO proteins. On the basis of this assay, we
calculated the value of Kd ¼ 93.4  7 nmol/L (Fig. 1C) for
the interaction of the FoxO protein with the DBE. This
indicates high-affinity binding, similar to that of the well
established DBE from the insulin receptor promoter used as a
reporter (28).

mechanisms may be involved in their regulation. The levels of
the Noxa, FasL, and TRAIL proteins correlate with the mRNA
data (Fig. 1A).
Since Noxa, a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein (28), was found
to promote formation of the Bak channel in cancer cells
exposed to a-TOS (29), we further focused here on the
regulation of NOXA transcription. We found that this process,
although previously shown to be regulated mainly by p53 (29),
was under our conditions regulated in a p53-independent
manner. We also observed decreased mRNA levels for other
transcription factors suggested to regulate NOXA transcription, that is, c-Myc and p73 (data not shown) during a-TOS
treatment, indicating that in our system transcription of the
NOXA gene may also involve other factor(s) (30).

The FoxO1 protein regulates NOXA transcription
Because several reports suggested a role for the FoxO1 (14,
33) and FoxO3a proteins in regulating apoptosis (10–12), we
tested their nuclear translocation as a marker of activation in
cancer cells exposed to a-TOS, analyzing nuclear and cytosolic
fractions by Western blotting. We observed barely detectable
levels of the FoxO1 protein in the nucleus of control Jurkat
cells, whereas a significant pool of the FoxO3a protein was
detected in the control cell nuclei (Fig. 2A). The FoxO1 protein
translocated to the nucleus within a 2-hour exposure of the
cells to a-TOS, and the levels of the protein remained relatively unchanged over the period of exposure. On the other
hand, nuclear levels of the FoxO3a protein gradually increased
during the treatment. We also observed decreasing levels of
FoxO1 in cytosolic fraction of Jurkat cell during a-TOS treatment (Fig. 2A), whereas the total level of the protein remained

Ab initio analysis of NOXA promoter reveals the
presence of a DAF-16–binding element
To identify elements that may regulate transcription of the
NOXA gene, we performed ab initio analysis of the human
NOXA promoter, employing Ensembl and the cis-Regulatory
Element Database (cis-RED; ref. 31). This resulted in the
identification of a conserved DBE, which is constrained in
this position of the NOXA gene in at least 11 different
mammalian species (Fig. 1B). This DBE is present in the
human NOXA promoter with the þ strand sequence TTG
TTT AC localized on chromosome 18 in the position
57,566,785 to 57,566,792, implicating regulation by FoxO proteins (32).

cells. This suggests that RNA Pol II associates with the NOXA
promoter in the resting cells and that an activation signal is
needed to promote initiation of transcription of the NOXA
gene, such as acetylation-induced chromatin opening promoted by FoxO proteins. In addition, we also tested the
presence of the FoxO3a in the NOXA gene promoter using
ChIP assay, but we observed only weak signal with nearly the
same intensity in control and a-TOS–treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We next used a FoxO activity marker to assess possible
changes in the chromatin structure associated with the FoxO1
activity in the NOXA promoter. Thus, ChIP assays were carried
out using an antibody against acetyl lysine, which represents
an epigenetic modification on histone proteins and proteins
involved in transcription commonly occurring on active promoters (34) and is also associated with the FoxO activity (35).
We monitored 3 regions in the NOXA promoter using specific
primers (the region around the TSS, the DBE, and within the
distal part, some 1,000 bp from the TSS) for lysine acetylation in cells treated with a-TOS (Fig. 3D). In control cells, we
detected a low signal only for the DBE region-specific primers,
and observed an increase in the signal in a-TOS–treated cells
for the DBE- and TSS-specific primers. No signal was observed
using primers specific for the distal region (Fig. 3C). These
results indicate that the region around TSS (some 500 bp) of
the NOXA gene promoter may represent an active part of the
promoter which functions in the regulation of the NOXA gene
transcription.

unchanged (data not shown). To further define the role of
FoxO1 and FoxO3a proteins in the regulation of the NOXA
gene, we knocked down the individual FoxO proteins with
specific siRNAs and assessed NOXA mRNA levels in the
a-TOS-exposed Jurkat and p53/ H1299 cells. Figure 2B
shows that the RNA interference (RNAi) approach reduced
the levels of the individual FoxO proteins. We next tested the
effect of the FoxO siRNAs on the expression of the NOXA gene.
The results clearly show that only FoxO1 siRNA decreased the
NOXA mRNA levels, in both the p53/ H1299 (Fig. 2C) and
Jurkat cells (Fig. 2D).
The FoxO1 protein binds to the DBE in the NOXA
promoter and causes its activation
To establish if the FoxO1 proteins are enriched in the NOXA
promoter on the newly identified DBE after a-TOS treatment,
we performed ChIP assays in Jurkat cells exposed to a-TOS for
4 hours. A significant increase in the FoxO1 protein levels
bound to this NOXA promoter region was observed after
a-TOS treatment (Fig. 3A). These results confirm that the
FoxO1 protein is activated to directly interact with the DBE in
the NOXA promoter after a-TOS exposure and suggest that
this promotes the induction of the NOXA gene transcription in
cells exposed to the VE analogue. In support of this, we found
RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) bound to the NOXA gene
transcription starting site (TSS) in Jurkat cells exposed to
a-TOS (Fig. 3B) while, interestingly, RNA Pol II was detected to
bind in the distal part of the NOXA promoter in control Jurkat

different Mst1-specific or NS siRNA were exposed to 50 mmol/L a-TOS for 4 hours and analyzed for NOXA mRNA levels by RT-PCR. Jurkat cells
treated with the Mst1-specific siRNA1 or NS siRNA and parental cells were tested for Noxa protein level after 4 hours of treatment by a-TOS using Western
blotting. The images shown are representative of 3 independent experiments.

The Hippo/Mst1 kinase regulates FoxO1 activation
The FoxO1 protein has been reported as a substrate for
several kinases (36), which are responsible for its regulation.
Of these, we detected activation (phosphorylation) of the
Hippo/Mst1 kinase in Jurkat as well as H1299 cells within
2 hours following addition of a-TOS (Fig. 4A and B). We
also observed the appearance of the p36 and p40 fragments
of the Hippo/Mst1 protein in the nuclear fraction of Jurkat
cells exposed to a-TOS (Fig. 4C). Formation of the cleaved
protein fragments has been documented to occur during
activation of the kinase and is important for its proapoptotic
functions (37, 38). Surprisingly, we were able to detect only
one active kinase fragment in the nucleus of H1299 cells
(Fig. 4C). This indicates a cell type-specific Hippo/Mst1
kinase processing.
We next tested the effect of lowering the Hippo/Mst1
protein levels by 2 different Mst1-specific siRNAs on the NOXA
gene expression in Jurkat cells. We observed a significant
decrease in the Noxa mRNA as well as protein levels in cells
exposed to a-TOS for 4 hours (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, we did
not detect any MST2 mRNA in Jurkat cells using primers
specific for this homologue of the Hippo/Mst1 kinase (data

not shown). These results indicate that the Hippo/Mst1 kinase
is likely to be the main protein kinase responsible for stimulating NOXA gene transcription in Jurkat cells exposed to
a-TOS.
To further examine the direct involvement of the Hippo/
Mst1 kinase in FoxO1 activation, nuclear extracts of Jurkat
cells treated with a-TOS were assessed for the levels of FoxO1
protein phosphorylated at serine 212, which is specifically
phosphorylated by the Hippo/Mst1 kinase (33). Using Western
blotting, increased levels of the pFoxO1 protein were detected
in the nuclear fraction of Jurkat cells but only low levels were
detected in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 5A). These results are
consistent with the aforementioned data (Fig. 2A) on the levels
of total FoxO1 protein detected in the nucleus of a-TOS–
treated cells. We also detected inhibition of FoxO1 translocation into the nucleus of Jurkat cells when the expression of the
Hippo/Mst1 protein was knocked down (Fig. 5B). Moreover,
the Hippo/Mst1 siRNA suppressed the levels of the FoxO1
protein phosphorylated on serine 212 in a-TOS–treated cells
(Fig. 5C). Finally, differences in cellular viability were analyzed
after treating Jurkat cells with a-TOS for 8 hours following
their pretreatment with the Hippo/Mst1 siRNA. Figure 5D

shows that knocking down the Hippo/Mst1 protein significantly increased the fraction of live cells compared with

Discussion
a-TOS represents a class of anticancer agents that selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells involving accumulation
of ROS (16, 18, 39), causing an increase in the Noxa protein
levels in a p53-independent process and triggering Bak channel formation in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Since
Noxa is the only Bcl-2 family protein regulated by a-TOS (25),
we studied here its regulation in the context of apoptosis
induced by the agent.
To determine which factors are involved in the regulation of
NOXA transcription, we performed ab initio analysis of the
NOXA promoter and found a constrained DBE, which is
conserved in a number of mammalian species. Because we
did not find any reports on FoxO protein binding to the DBEcontaining region in the NOXA promoter, we believe this is the
first example which clearly identifies a specific role for the
FoxO1 protein in regulating the NOXA promoter. These results
are in agreement with recent reports demonstrating activation of NOXA transcription in a FoxO3 DBD-dependent manner in endothelial cells (40), and can also be reconciled with
the role of FoxO proteins in apoptosis induction by oxidative
stress or chemotherapeutic agents (9, 10, 36, 41). With regard
to this, we have also demonstrated fast Hippo/Mst1 kinase
activation induced by hydrogen peroxide which led to the
FoxO1 protein phosphorylation at serine 212 and its nuclear
localization, followed by increased NOXA gene transcription
(Supplementary Fig. S2). These pioneer observations firstly
linked ROS-induced NOXA gene transcription to the Hippo/

Mst1 kinase signaling. Although we observe activation of the
Hippo/Mst1 protein in response to a-TOS as well as hydrogen
peroxide, its mechanism, which may include direct or indirect
effect, is unclear at this stage and will be a subject of further
investigation.
Thus far, only the FoxO3a protein has been reported to
regulate the NOXA gene transcription (10, 40). Using siRNA, we
observed in our system that the NOXA gene transcription is
modulated specifically by the FoxO1 protein. One possible
explanation for the differences with other studies is that the
expression of FoxO proteins may vary depending on the cell
type (41). The exact molecular mechanism of FoxO-dependent
NOXA transcription has been only partially decoded. Several
papers have reported that FoxO proteins promote acetylation
of histone proteins in the target promoters via recruitment of
the CBP/p300 acetyl transferase, facilitating (RNA Pol II)
binding to TSS (35, 36). We observed an increase in lysine
acetylation in the NOXA promoter following FoxO1 activation
in Jurkat cells treated with a-TOS (Fig. 3D) and also detected
translocation of RNA Pol II from the DBE region in the NOXA
promoter to its TSS (Fig. 3C). Similar results demonstrating
presence of RNA Pol II in distal parts of the NOXA promoter in
control cells were also published by others (42). This suggests
that the FoxO1 protein can stimulate transcription of NOXA
via acetylation of the histone proteins in the NOXA promoter.
Interestingly, ChIP analysis of Jurkat cells treated with a-TOS
also showed increased p53 protein binding following FoxO1
binding to the NOXA promoter (data not shown), which
indicates that the FoxO-dependent acetylation of the NOXA
promoter may also allow binding of other transcription factors. To this end, a possible cross-talk between FoxO, p53 and
other factors (e.g., ATFs) is a focus of current FoxO research
(36, 43), and such cross-talk may fine-tune activation of the

The Mst1-FoxO1 Pathway Controls Noxa Expression

NOXA gene transcription following FoxO1 binding to its
promoter in cancer cells exposed to anticancer drugs. However, since a-TOS triggers FoxO-dependent NOXA upregulation in the p53/ H1299 cells, the p53 transcription factor is
not required for the regulation of the FoxO-Noxa pathway, at
least in some systems.
Our observations are supported by other recent reports
demonstrating Hippo/Mst1-dependent apoptosis induction,
largely due to the involvement of the FoxO1 protein (33, 35).
Studies identifying other proapoptotic genes regulated by the
Hippo/Mst1 kinase are scarce. However, we have also
observed transcriptional upregulation of the FASL and TRAIL
genes and their protein products, which have been reported as
alternative FoxO targets (11–13). Therefore, the FASL and
TRAIL genes are probably additional targets for the Hippo/
Mst1-FoxO1 pathway in Jurkat cells, indicating that the
Hippo/Mst1-FoxO1 axis may represent a potent tumor suppressor system. We observed no changes in the Bim mRNA or
protein levels in cancer cells treated with a-TOS (25). This is
rather surprising because BIM transcription has been reported
to be linked to the activation of FoxO proteins (10). Therefore,
it would appear that transcription of BIM is not regulated by
the Hippo/Mst1-FoxO1 pathway in cancer cells exposed to the
VE analogue. The BIM promoter may be also epigenetically
deregulated in the Jurkat cells, as it was found to be constitutively expressed (data not shown).
Taken together, we have established a novel tumor
suppressor pathway based on the activation of the Hippo/

Mst1-FoxO1-Noxa axis and we also found that this pathway
regulates transcription of additional proapoptotic genes
(e.g., FASL and TRAIL). On the basis of this study, we
propose a new molecular mechanism by which cancer
cell-selective agents such as a-TOS trigger the Hippo/
Mst1-dependent expression of the BH3-only protein Noxa
that, in turn, causes mitochondrial permeabilization and
apoptosis (25). To translate these findings into the context
of tumor therapy, a study has been initiated to verify the
Hippo/Mst1-FoxO1-Noxa pathway in an experimental
model of cancer.
