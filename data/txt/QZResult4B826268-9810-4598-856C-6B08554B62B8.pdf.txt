Abstract
Angiogenesis inhibitors that block VEGF receptor (VEGFR) signaling slow the growth of many types of
tumors, but eventually the disease progresses. Multiple strategies are being explored to improve efficacy by
concurrent inhibition of other functionally relevant receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). XL880 (foretinib,
GSK1363089) and XL184 (cabozantinib) are small-molecule inhibitors that potently block multiple RTKs,
including VEGFR and the receptor of hepatocyte growth factor c-Met, which can drive tumor invasion and
metastasis. This study compared the cellular effects of XL880 and XL184 with those of an RTK inhibitor (XL999)
that blocks VEGFR but not c-Met. Treatment of RIP-Tag2 mice with XL999 resulted in 43% reduction in
vascularity of spontaneous pancreatic islet tumors over 7 days, but treatment with XL880 or XL184 eliminated
approximately 80% of the tumor vasculature, reduced pericytes and empty basement membrane sleeves, caused
widespread intratumoral hypoxia and tumor cell apoptosis, and slowed regrowth of the tumor vasculature after
drug withdrawal. Importantly, XL880 and XL184 also decreased invasiveness of primary tumors and reduced
metastasis. Overall, these findings indicate that inhibition of c-Met and functionally related kinases amplifies the
effects of VEGFR blockade and leads to rapid, robust, and progressive regression of tumor vasculature, increased
intratumoral hypoxia and apoptosis, and reduced tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Cancer Res; 71(14);

Introduction
Inhibitors of VEGF signaling block VEGF-driven angiogenesis, prune VEGF-dependent blood vessels, and normalize
vessels that do not regress (1–4). VEGF inhibitors can also
promote tumor invasion and metastasis in some preclinical
models (5, 6), but the underlying mechanism is still unclear (7,
8). Treatment of cancer patients with VEGF inhibitors can
slow tumor growth and in some cases prolong survival, but
resistance eventually develops and the disease progresses
through growth of residual primary tumor or metastases
(9–12). Inhibitors that target other pathways, such as those
involved in tumor invasiveness, are therefore being developed
(13, 14).
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, scatter factor), through its
HGF receptor (HGFR) c-Met, is a potent motility factor and
mitogen (15–18). HGF and c-Met are upregulated in many

human cancers and contribute to tumor growth, angiogenesis,
invasiveness, and metastasis (19, 20). Inhibition of the HGF/
c-Met pathway can reduce tumor growth, angiogenesis, and
metastasis in preclinical models (21–24).
c-Met expression is increased by hypoxia through activation of hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and contributes
to the aggressiveness of hypoxic tumors (25). HIF-1a–
induced c-Met expression could be triggered by vascular
pruning caused by VEGF inhibitors and could select for
migratory, invasive tumor cells and predispose spread by
metastasis (26). The strategic roles of VEGF receptor
(VEGFR) and c-Met signaling in tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis make these receptors attractive therapeutic targets (16–18, 27).
We examined the effects of 2 small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors, XL880 (foretinib, GSK1363089)
and XL184 (cabozantinib), that block phosphorylation of c-Met
and VEGFR at nanomolar or subnanomolar concentrations
(27–29) to assess the interaction of these receptors in tumors.
As set out in Table 1, both XL880 and XL184 block c-Met and
VEGFR-2. In addition, XL880 inhibits AXL, Tie2, KIT, FLT3,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and RON (27,
30, 31), and XL184 inhibits AXL, Tie2, KIT, FLT3, and RET but
not PDGFR or RON (28, 29, 32). The lack of overlap of PDGFR
and RON makes these receptors unlikely to explain the mutual
effects of XL880 and XL184 on tumors.
The effects of a third RTK inhibitor, XL999, which blocks
VEGFR, PDGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),
FLT3, KIT, and AXL, was used for comparison because it

does not block c-Met but does block many other targets of
XL880 and XL184 (33, 34). Spontaneous pancreatic islet
tumors in RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice were used as a model
(4, 35, 36), and the abundance, cellular composition, and
receptor expression of tumor blood vessels, intratumoral
hypoxia, and measures of tumor aggressiveness were used as
readouts.
Our studies revealed that XL880 or XL184, but not XL999,
led to rapid, widespread, and progressive regression of tumor
vasculature, extensive hypoxia, and apoptosis of tumor cells
and decreased tumor aggressiveness.

Materials and Methods
Animals
RIP-Tag2 mice in a C57BL/6 background were used as the
tumor model (35). All experiments were approved by the
University of California, San Francisco, Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
Treatments
RIP-Tag2 mice were 10-week-olds at the onset of treatment,
unless otherwise indicated. XL880 (foretinib, GSK1363089),
XL184 (cabozantinib), and XL999 were suspended at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in sterile saline or water and administered by gavage, daily for 7 days (see Supplementary Materials
and Methods).
Detection of functional blood vessels and hypoxia
Functional blood vessels in tumors were identified
and marked by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled
Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (LEA; 1 mg/mL, 100 mL; Vector
Laboratories), injected via a tail vein (i.v.) 2 minutes before
the perfusion of fixative (4). Hypoxic regions of tumors
were identified by pimonidazole hydrochloride (60 mg/kg,
2.5 mL/g of mouse body weight; Hypoxyprobe Plus Kit
HP2; Chemicon) injected i.v. 1 hour before the perfusion
(5).
Tissue fixation and immunohistochemistry
Mice were perfused through the heart with paraformaldehyde fixative (4, 36). Cryostat sections (80 mm in thickness)
were stained with combinations of the antibodies (see Supplementary Materials and Methods).

Imaging and analysis
Specimens were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope and a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Area densities of endothelial cells, pericytes,
basement membrane, apoptotic cells, and hypoxic regions
were calculated from digital fluorescence microscopic images,
using an empirically determined threshold value of 30 to 50 (4,
36). Intensity of VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and E-cadherin immunofluorescence was measured (4, 36). Metastases of RIP-Tag2
tumors were identified in sections of liver stained for SV40 Tantigen. Vascularity of the trachea was expressed as the
average number of capillaries that crossed cartilage rings
(10 rings/mouse, 4–5 mice/group; ref. 37).
Tumor size and Invasion index
The size of tumors in the pancreas from RIP-Tag2 mice
treated with vehicle, XL880, or XL184 for 7 days (5 mice/group)
was assessed in 80-mm sections stained for insulin or SV40 Tantigen and expressed as the sectional area of tumor (4).
Invasion index was measured using ImageJ on fluorescence
microscopic images (5 objective, 1 Optovar) of 80-mm
sections of pancreas stained for insulin or SV40 T-antigen
(red) and amylase (green channel). The red channel of RGB
images was converted to 8-bit gray scale, and the tumor
border was outlined using the freehand tool. Regions outside
the tumor were filled black. A threshold in the range of 0 to 255
was applied to include all tumor cells and then the image was
converted to binary. Invasion index (values 1.0) was calculated from the area and perimeter of the tumor by the formula:
1/(4p  area/perimeter2), where a circle has a value of 1.0. The
median Invasion index was calculated for all tumors in each
mouse (10–21 tumors/mouse). The mean Invasion index for
each group was calculated from the median value for each
mouse (4 mice/group).
Immunoprecipitation and quantitative reverse
transcriptase-PCR
Immunoprecipitation and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis were carried out as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistics
Values are expressed as means  SE (4–6 mice/group). The
significance of differences between groups was assessed by

multiple comparisons (P < 0.05 values were considered significant).

Results
Massive regression of tumor vessels after XL880 or
XL184 treatment
Blood vessels in RIP-Tag2 tumors were abundant, irregular,
and tortuous under baseline conditions [Fig. 1A (i)] but were
sparse after XL880 treatment for 7 days [Fig. 1A (ii)]. Loss of
tumor vessels was dose and time dependent. Reductions
ranged from 40% at 10 mg/kg to 80% at 60 mg/kg [Fig. 1A
(iii)]. Time course studies revealed no reduction at 6 hours,
40% reduction at 1 day, 76% at 7 days, and 90% at 14 days
[Fig. 1B (i–iv)]. Tumor vascularity decreased after XL184

treatment [Fig. 1C (i and ii)], with reductions ranging from
67% at 3 mg/kg to 83% at 30 mg/kg for 7 days [Fig. 1C (iii)].
XL999, which inhibits VEGFR but not c-Met, reduced the
vascularity of RIP-Tag2 tumors, but the magnitude of the
reduction at 7 days (43%) was significantly less than after
XL880 (80%) or XL184 (77%) treatment [Fig. 1D (i)], and the
surviving blood vessels were different. After XL880 or XL184
treatment for 7 days or longer, many remaining tumor
vessels were narrow, variable in diameter, and appeared
fragmented [Fig. 1D (ii)]. In contrast, most tumor vessels
present after XL999 treatment for 7 days were larger, more
uniform in caliber ("normalized"), and had less branching
and fewer sprouts than present under baseline conditions
[Fig. 1D (iii)].
Because of evidence that some capillaries of normal organs
regress after VEGF inhibition (4, 38, 39), we investigated this

effect of XL880 and found consistent reductions in the number
of capillaries in the trachea, thyroid, choriocapillaris of the eye,
and jejunum (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Reduction in VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3
Strong and widespread VEGFR-2 immunoreactivity highlighted the dense vascularity of RIP-Tag2 tumors under baseline
conditions [Fig. 2A (i)] but was conspicuously reduced after
XL880 treatment [Fig. 2A (ii)]. Overall, VEGFR-2 immunoreactivity was reduced by 93% after the 7-day treatment [Fig. 2A (iii)].
The speed of the change was evident by the 86% reduction in the
expression of VEGFR-2 mRNA after only 1 day [Fig. 2A (iv)].
VEGFR-3 immunoreactivity was also strong and widespread on tumor vessels and was sharply reduced by XL880
treatment for 7 days [Fig. 2B (i and ii)]. Overall, VEGFR-3

immunoreactivity was reduced by 94% at 7 days [Fig. 2A (iii)],
which was obvious in blood vessels but did not occur in
peritumoral lymphatics [Fig. 2B (ii), arrows]. Expression of
VEGFR-3 mRNA was reduced by 80% after 1 day only [Fig. 2A
(iv)].
The large reductions in VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 immunoreactivity in treated tumors [Fig. 2A (iii)] resulted from 2
changes: (i) decreased vascularity, reflected by the reduction
in number of tumor vessels [Fig. 2A (ii) and B (ii)], and (ii)
decreased receptor protein in the surviving tumor vessels,
reflected by the dose-dependent decrease in brightness of
immunofluorescence [Fig. 2B (iii and iv)]. Because of this dual
effect, the reductions in overall VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 immunoreactivity and expression were significantly greater than the
corresponding reductions in CD31 [Fig. 2A (iii and iv)].

Impaired function of surviving tumor vessels
Blood vessel function was assessed by i.v. injection of FITClabeled LEA, which uniformly stains the luminal surface of the
endothelium of perfused blood vessels (4). Under baseline
conditions, the pattern of lectin staining in tumors largely
matched the distribution of CD31 staining [Fig. 2C (i and ii)],
indicating that most vessels were functional. After XL880
treatment for 7 days, tumor vascularity was markedly reduced
and lectin staining was absent in some of the remaining
vessels [Fig. 2C (iii and iv), arrows], indicative of impaired
functionality, or was discontinuous [Fig. 2D (i)] in vessels that
had discontinuous staining for CD31 and type IV collagen
[Fig. 2D (ii and iii)], consistent with vessels undergoing
regression.

Reduction in pericytes and empty basement membrane
sleeves
NG2-positive pericytes were abundant throughout RIPTag2 tumors under baseline conditions [Fig. 3A (i)] but were
sparse after XL880 or XL184 treatment for 7 days [Fig. 3A (ii
and iii)]. Measurements showed a 71% reduction in NG2
immunoreactivity after the highest dose of XL880 [Fig. 3B
(i)], which was almost as large as the corresponding 80%
reduction in CD31 [Fig. 1A (iii)]. The abnormally loose association of pericytes with tumor blood vessels was prominent
under baseline conditions [Fig. 3B (ii)] and was still evident
after XL880 treatment [Fig. 3B (iii)].
Type IV collagen immunoreactivity largely matched the
CD31 staining of blood vessels in tumors at baseline

Amplified Antiangiogenic Action in Tumors

[Fig. 3C (i and ii)]. The amount of type IV collagen was reduced
after XL880 treatment for 7 days [Fig. 3C (iii)] but not as much
as CD31 staining [Fig. 3C (iv)]. Measurements showed a 52%
reduction in type IV collagen compared with the 80% reduction in CD31 [Fig. 3D (i)].
The number of empty basement membrane sleeves was
reflected by the discrepancy between the loss of endothelial
cells and the loss of basement membrane [Fig. 3D (i)]. After
XL880 treatment for 7 days, about 20% of the original amount
of basement membrane was on surviving tumor vessels, 28%
was in the form of empty sleeves, and 52% was lost. Vascular
basement membrane was similarly reduced after XL184 treatment [Fig. 3D (ii and iii)].
Regrowth of tumor vasculature
Stopping XL880 after treatment for 7 days was followed by
partial regrowth of the tumor vasculature over the subsequent
7 days, but tumor vascularity did not return to the baseline
[Supplementary Fig. S2A (i–iv)]. With 77% reduction in vascularity after 7-day treatment as a reference, recovery was 22%
(58% below baseline) at 2 days and was 51% (29% below
baseline) at 7 days [Supplementary Fig. S2B (i)]. Consistent
with continuing regrowth, endothelial cell sprouts were still
present at 7 days [Supplementary Fig. S2B (ii)].
Recovery of the intensity of VEGFR-2 immunofluorescence
of tumor vessels was not similarly delayed. Brightness of
VEGFR-2 immunofluorescence was 54% less than baseline
after XL880 treatment for 7 days but was only 21% less at
2 days and was back to baseline at 7 days [Supplementary
Fig. S2B (iii)]. Similarly, hypoxic regions of tumors marked by
pimonidazole staining rapidly decreased after XL880 treatment was withdrawn and were not present at 7 days after
treatment ended [Supplementary Fig. S2C (i–iv)].
Distribution of c-Met in tumors
Under baseline conditions, the pattern of c-Met immunoreactivity was largely vascular [Fig. 4A (i)]. About 7% of blood
vessels in RIP-Tag2 tumors were stained. Vascular staining for
c-Met was much less after XL880 [Fig. 4A (ii)] or XL184 [Fig. 4A
(iii)] treatment but was not noticeably different after XL999
treatment for 7 days [Fig. 4A (iv)]. Colocalization with CD31
staining confirmed the association of most c-Met immunoreactivity with endothelial cells [Fig. 4B (i–iv)]. Surface plots of
c-Met immunofluorescence of baseline tumors showed that
the vascular pattern was surrounded by weak, uniform background fluorescence in regions where tumor cells predominated [Fig. 4C (i)]. In contrast, surface plots of tumors after
XL880 or XL184 treatment lacked the vascular pattern but still
had the weak background fluorescence [Fig. 4C (ii and iii)].
Neither the amount nor the distribution of c-Met immunoreactivity changed appreciably after XL999 treatment [Fig. 4C
(iv)]. Colocalization of faint c-Met immunoreactivity with
staining for SV40 T-antigen was consistent with weak
c-Met expression in some tumor cells under baseline conditions [Fig. 4D (i)].
Pixels where c-Met immunoreactivity colocalized with
CD31 decreased by at least half after XL880 or XL184
treatment, suggestive of a preferential effect on endothelial

www.aacrjournals.org

cells [Fig. 4D (ii)]. This was not found after XL999 treatment.
Overall, c-Met protein in tumors assessed by immunoprecipitation was slightly less after XL184 treatment, but phosphorylated c-Met was markedly reduced after XL184
treatment for 7 days [Fig. 4D (iii)]. Neither of them changed
after XL999 treatment [Fig. 4D (iii)].
Intratumoral hypoxia and apoptosis
Hypoxic regions marked by pimonidazole staining were
sparse or absent in tumors of 10- or 11-week old RIP-Tag2
mice treated with vehicle [Fig. 5A (i)] but were abundant and
conspicuous in tumors after XL880 or XL184 treatment for
7 days [Fig. 5A (ii and iii)]. Surface plots highlighted the
difference between negligible pimonidazole immunofluorescence in vehicle-treated tumors and the strong, widespread
staining after XL880 treatment [Fig. 5B (i)]. Pimonidazole
staining was increased about 100-fold, from 11% of tumor
area after XL880 treatment and 9% after XL184 treatment,
compared with the baseline value of only 0.1% [Fig. 5B (ii)].
After XL880 or XL184 treatment, most pimonidazole staining was in regions of tumors that were avascular or had
narrowed blood vessels [Fig. 5A (ii and iii)]. Many pimonidazole-positive regions were separated from blood vessels by
sleeves of unstained tumor cells [average width 36  3 mm,
Fig. 5B (iii)]. Pimonidazole staining next to narrowed or
fragmented tumor vessels did not have an intervening sleeve
of unstained cells [Fig. 5B (iii)].
Apoptotic cells identified by activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity were scattered in baseline tumors [Fig. 5C (i)]. After
XL880 or XL184 treatment, activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity was much more extensive and was associated with
clumps of cells [Fig. 5C (ii)]. The fractional area of activated
caspase-3 increased 5-fold after the highest dose of XL880 for
7 days [Fig. 5C (iii)]. Some activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity coincided with CD31 staining, indicative of apoptotic
endothelial cells [Fig. 5D (i)]. Activated caspase-3 staining
after XL184 treatment resembled that after XL880 treatment
[Fig. 5C (ii) and D (ii)], but after XL999 treatment, the staining
resembled that found in baseline tumors [Fig. 5C (i) and D
(iii)].
Tumor aggressiveness
As indices of aggressiveness of RIP-Tag2 tumors, we examined tumor shape, E-cadherin staining, size, and metastasis to
the liver. The contour of the tumor perimeter was assessed in
sections stained for insulin or SV40 T-antigen in tumor cells
and amylase in the surrounding acinar pancreas. Vehicletreated tumors had irregular borders [Fig. 6A (i and ii)],
but tumors treated with XL880 for 14 days had a smooth
contour and distinct margin with the neighboring acinar
pancreas [Fig. 6A (iii and iv)]. The irregularity of the tumor
border, quantified as the Invasion index, was significantly less
(value ¼ 3.4) after XL880 treatment for 14 days than after
vehicle treatment [value ¼ 5.4; Fig. 6B (i–iii)].
E-cadherin immunoreactivity of tumor cells, as an indicator
of epithelial-mesenchymal transition status (40), was faint to
absent under baseline conditions [Supplementary Fig. S2D (i)]

To determine whether RIP-Tag2 tumors become more
invasive after XL880 is withdrawn, we treated mice with
XL880 for 7 days, from age 10 to 11 weeks, and then studied
them 7 or 14 days later. The border of tumors was irregular at
baseline but was much smoother after XL880 treatment for
7 days [Fig. 6D (i and ii)]. At 7 days after treatment ended, the
tumor border was still smooth, but small groups of tumor cells
projected into the surrounding acinar pancreas [Fig. 6D (iii)].
At 14 days, tumors had irregular borders similar to but not
greater than those at baseline [Fig. 6D (i and iv)]. Measurements of Invasion index reflected these changes [Fig. 6D (v)].

Discussion
The overall goal of this study was to determine the cellular
effects of 2 small-molecule RTK inhibitors, XL880 and XL184,

that block key signaling pathways involved in angiogenesis
and tumor invasiveness. Both inhibitors target VEGFR and
c-Met at low nanomolar or subnanomolar concentrations,
together with several other RTKs, and both had rapid, robust,
profound, and largely similar cellular effects on blood vessels
and tumor cells of RIP-Tag2 tumors. These effects differed
qualitatively and quantitatively from those found after treatment with XL999, an RTK inhibitor that does not target c-Met
but does block VEGFR plus multiple other receptors blocked
by XL880 and XL184.
Treatment with XL880 or XL184 led to rapid and severe
changes in tumor blood vessels, which were greater than after
XL999 over a similar dosage range or after other VEGF
inhibitors (4, 36, 41). VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 proteins and
their respective mRNA expression were reduced even more
than corresponding values for CD31, consistent with dual

effects of vessel regression and downregulation of expression
on the remaining tumor vessels (4, 36).
Selective inhibition of VEGF signaling causes regression of
some tumor vessels, but those that remain tend to be more
normal (3, 4), which were confirmed after XL999. However,
surviving tumor vessels were qualitatively different after
XL880 or XL184 treatment, which were narrow, fragmented,
and not stained by i.v. FITC-LEA, suggestive of continuing
regression (4, 36, 41). The tumor vascularity continued to
decrease during the second week of XL880 treatment. This
progressive change differs from vascular regression due to
many selective VEGF inhibitors, which tends to plateau after a
week or so as tumor vessels normalize (3, 4).
Basement membrane sleeves and pericytes were decreased
after treatment with XL880 or XL184. Some reduction was also
found with XL999, as has been reported for other VEGF

inhibitors (4, 36, 41), but the decrease was less. Basement
membrane sleeves depend in part on the viability of the
associated endothelial cells and/or pericytes, but they were
not lost proportionally: endothelial cells were reduced by 80%,
pericytes by 71%, and basement membrane by only 52%.
Tumor vessels rapidly regrow after withdrawal of VEGF
inhibitors (36). Tumor vessels also regrew after withdrawal of
XL880 or XL184, but the regrowth was slowed. Although the
mechanism is uncertain, one factor for the reduced vascular
regrowth after XL880 or XL184 treatment may be the greater
loss of pericytes and basement membrane sleeves that provide
a scaffold for regrowing blood vessels (36).
To better understand the robust effects of XL880 and
XL184 on blood vessels in RIP-Tag2 tumors, we examined
the amount and distribution of c-Met immunoreactivity.

Cancer Res; 71(14) July 15, 2011

Strong staining for c-Met was consistently found in some
tumor vessels at baseline. Colocalization with CD31 indicated the vascular staining of c-Met was restricted to
endothelial cells. In addition, some tumor cells marked by
SV40 T-antigen had faint c-Met immunoreactivity. Vascular
staining for c-Met was conspicuously less after XL880 or
XL184 treatment but was unchanged after XL999 treatment.
Consistent with this finding, total c-Met and phosphorylated
c-Met, assessed by immunoprecipitation, were both reduced
after XL184 treatment, but neither was significantly reduced
after XL999 treatment. On the basis of intensity of c-Met
immunoreactivity, vascular endothelial cells probably made
a significant contribution to the signal in the immunoblots
and were targets of XL880 and XL184, but the presence of
weak staining in tumor cells indicates that c-Met blockade is

Amplified Antiangiogenic Action in Tumors

also likely to have direct effects on tumor cells in the RIPTag2 model.
The robust effects of XL880 and XL184 on RIP-Tag2 tumors
were not limited to tumor vessels. Intratumoral hypoxia and
tumor cell apoptosis were also widespread. Induction of
hypoxia and apoptosis was probably due to the extensive
and progressive pruning of tumor vessels without vessel
normalization. The association of pimonidazole staining with
regions of tumor that had few or no blood vessels is consistent
with this interpretation.
Invasiveness, which is a typical feature of aggressive tumors
(42, 43), increases in some preclinical models after inhibition
of VEGF (5, 6, 44, 45). Treatment with XL880 resulted in
smaller and less invasive tumors in RIP-Tag2 mice, and,
importantly, recovery of tumor invasiveness was slowed
and did not rebound at an exaggerated rate during the first
2 weeks after XL880 was withdrawn.
The involvement of c-Met in the anti-invasive action of
XL880 and XL184 is consistent with their potent inhibitory
actions on c-Met, the presence of c-Met immunoreactivity in
RIP-Tag2 tumors under baseline conditions, and the reduction
in c-Met and invasiveness after treatment. XL880 and XL184
had IC50 values for c-Met of 0.4 and 1.3 nmol/L compared with
463 nmol/L for XL999. Involvement of c-Met also fits with the
reduction in phospho-c-Met protein in the tumors after
treatment with XL184. XL999 lacked the robust effect of
XL880 and XL184 on apoptosis of blood vessels and tumor
cells in RIP-Tag2 tumors. Although inhibition of AXL could
contribute to the anti-invasive action, as reported in other
models (46–49), this is unlikely to be the main target because
XL880, XL184, and XL999 block AXL about equally, with IC50
values in the range of 4.6 to 11 nmol/L.
The kinase profiles of XL880, XL184, and XL999 had differences in addition to c-Met, and drug efficacy is also influenced
by in vivo absorption, stability, clearance, and other chemical
properties that influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Therefore, confirmation of essential or exclusive roles
of inhibition of c-Met and VEGFR in the anti-invasive effects of
XL880 and XL184 will require the use of more selective

inhibitors, comparison of drug actions after genetic deletion
of c-Met, or other strategies that target these signaling pathways without impacting other receptors.
In conclusion, we found that XL880 and XL184 caused rapid
and extensive regression of endothelial cells and pericytes of
blood vessels in RIP-Tag2 tumors. Regression of the tumor
vasculature was widespread, progressive, and accompanied by
extensive intratumoral hypoxia and apoptosis of tumor cells.
The treated tumors were smaller, less invasive, and accompanied by fewer liver metastases. The findings are consistent
with the distinctive antitumoral actions of XL880 and XL184
resulting from inhibition of VEGFR and c-Met together.
However, inhibition of other receptors and chemical properties that influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
could also contribute. Careful assessment using strategies for
selective inhibition or knockdown of individual receptors or
pathways will be necessary to determine whether inhibition of
VEGFR and c-Met is necessary and sufficient to reproduce all
of the robust effects of XL880 and XL184 on tumors.
