Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Appropriate repair of DNA lesions and the inhibition of DNA repair activities at telomeres are
critical to prevent genomic instability. By fuelling the generation of genetic alterations and by
compromising cell viability, genomic instability is a driving force in cancer and aging1, 2. Here we
identify MAD2L2 (also known as MAD2B or REV7) through functional genetic screening as a
novel factor controlling DNA repair activities at mammalian telomeres. We show that MAD2L2
accumulates at uncapped telomeres and promotes non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated
fusion of deprotected chromosome ends and genomic instability. MAD2L2 depletion causes
elongated 3′ telomeric overhangs, implying that MAD2L2 inhibits 5′ end-resection. End-resection
blocks NHEJ while committing to homology-directed repair (HDR) and is under control of
53BP1, RIF1 and PTIP3. Consistent with MAD2L2 promoting NHEJ-mediated telomere fusion by
inhibiting 5′ end-resection, knockdown of the nucleases CTIP or EXO1 partially restores
telomere-driven genomic instability in MAD2L2-depleted cells. Control of DNA repair by
MAD2L2 is not limited to telomeres. MAD2L2 also accumulates and inhibits end-resection at
irradiation (IR)-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and promotes end-joining of DSBs in
multiple settings, including during immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR). These
activities of MAD2L2 depend on ATM kinase activity, RNF8, RNF168, 53BP1 and RIF1, but not

Together our data establish MAD2L2 as a critical contributor to the control of DNA repair activity

As the processes underlying telomere-driven genomic instability are not completely
understood we performed a functional genetic screen to identify telomere-induced genomic
instability regulators (TIGIRs). The TIGIR-screen relies on well-controlled reversible
inactivation of telomere component TRF2 by expressing temperature-sensitive TRF2-I468A
(TRF2ts) in Trf2−/−;p53−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs)5. At the permissive
temperature (32°C) TRF2ts MEFs have intact TRF2-mediated telomere protection, but at
non-permissive temperatures (37-39°C) TRF2ts is inactive, causing ATM kinase activation,
accumulation of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins and NHEJ-dependent ligation at
chromosome ends5. In the TIGIR-screen (Fig. 1a) prolonged TRF2-inactivation causes
TRF2ts cells to irreversibly arrest or die due to severe chromosome end fusion that drives
cells into genomic crisis6-8. However, diminished telomere fusion, such as upon DNAligaseIV- or RNF8-deficiency, allows survival and proliferation despite telomere
uncapping9-11.

In a triplicate TIGIR-screen we assayed 1976 short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), targeting 391
genes linked to DDR, for shRNAs that allow TRF2ts cells to survive 12 days of telomere
uncapping. Among shRNA-targets significantly enriched in at least 2 of 3 screens were
multiple factors previously shown to control telomere fusion (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b),
including ATM, NBS1, RAD50, 53BP1 and RNF811-15. Remarkably, the most prominent
screen hit, also independently recovered in a genome-wide TIGIR-screen (our unpublished
results), was MAD2L2 (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). MAD2L2 has no known function at
telomeres but acts as a non-catalytic interaction partner of REV1 and REV3 in TLS4.
Knockdown of Mad2l2 with independent shRNAs markedly increased survival of TRF2ts
MEFs subjected to telomere uncapping, which was abolished by complementation with
exogenous shRNA-resistant human MAD2L2 (Fig. 1b,c, Extended Data Fig. 1c-f).
Interestingly, we failed to detect a similar activity for REV1 or REV3 (Extended Data Fig.
1g-i).
Indeed, enhanced survival of MAD2L2-depleted cells upon long-term TRF2 inactivation
was due to diminished telomere fusion. Mad2l2 knockdown significantly reduced telomere
fusions, which was prevented by complementation with exogenous MAD2L2 (Fig. 2a,
Extended Data Fig. 2a). Telomeres end with a single-stranded 3′ G-overhang that undergoes
DNA-LigaseIV/NHEJ-dependent degradation upon loss of TRF2-mediated telomere
protection9, 10. Analysis of telomeric 3′ G-overhangs showed that MAD2L2 depletion
prevents overhang loss at 48 hours of TRF2 inactivation, further confirming that MAD2L2
is essential for efficient processing of deprotected telomeres by NHEJ (Fig. 2b, Extended
Data Fig. 2b). The defect in NHEJ-mediated telomere fusion in Mad2l2-knockdown cells
was not explained by changes in cell-cycle progression (Fig. 1b: 32°C panels, Extended
Data Fig. 1e, 2c,d). Moreover, MAD2L2 is essential for sister-telomere fusion upon
activation of DNA repair in mitosis16 (Extended Data Fig. 2e). In line with MAD2L2
promoting telomere fusion, chromosomal rearrangement and mis-segregation6-8, MAD2L2

depletion prevented tetraploidy and aneuploidy upon telomere uncapping (Fig. 2c, Extended
Data Fig. 2f).

To address if the requirement of MAD2L2 for NHEJ extends beyond telomeres we
investigated whether MAD2L2 depletion affects end-joining in other settings. Knockdown
of human MAD2L2 significantly impaired NHEJ-mediated repair of I-Sce1-induced DNA
DSBs, NHEJ-mediated random-plasmid integration, resolution of IR-induced DSBs in HRdeficient cells and clonogenic survival upon IR, similar to depletion of the NHEJ promoting
factors 53BP1 and RIF1 (Fig. 2d,e, Extended Data Fig. 3a-e). Moreover, CSR, a
physiological process depending on joining of DNA DSBs by NHEJ17, was significantly
impaired in MAD2L2-depleted cells (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 3f-i). This CSR defect was
not due to defects in cell proliferation or expression of AID mRNA, IgM and IgA germ line
transcripts. Thus, MAD2L2 promotes NHEJ-mediated repair in multiple contexts.
To investigate how MAD2L2 promotes NHEJ, we first addressed its localization. MAD2L2
accumulated both at TRF2-deprotected telomeres and IR-induced DSBs (Fig. 3a), implying
a direct activity of MAD2L2 at these sites. Next we examined activation of the DDR. At 3, 6
and 12 hours of TRF2 inactivation both control and MAD2L2-depleted cells activated ATM,
phosphorylated H2AX, KAP1 and CHK2, and formed p-ATM and γ-H2AX foci to a similar
extent (Fig. 3b,c, Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Moreover, accumulation of 53BP1, RIF1 and
PTIP to uncapped telomeres, as well as IR-induced DSBs, was unperturbed in MAD2L2depleted cells (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 4a-c). Thus, MAD2L2 is not required for
recognition of uncapped telomeres or DSBs as damage, nor for initiation of DDR signalling.
However, probably reflecting aberrant processing of deprotected telomeres, we noticed
increased DDR signalling at 24 and 48 hours of TRF2 inactivation in MAD2L2-depleted
cells, visible as elevated H2AX and KAP1 phosphorylation, and H2AX ubiquitylation (Fig.
3b).

Next we examined the terminal structure of telomeres in more detail. Analysis of 3′ singlestrand G-overhangs at 6 and 12 hours of TRF2 inactivation revealed that in absence of
MAD2L2, telomeres gain significantly longer 3′ single-stranded overhangs. At 12 hours,
Mad2l2-knockdown cells contained 2,5-fold higher, 3′-exonuclease sensitive, overhang
signals than control cells without uncapping and nearly 6-fold higher overhang signals than
control cells at 12 hours of telomere uncapping (Fig. 3d,e, Extended Data Fig. 5a). Overhang
increase upon MAD2L2 depletion was observed in both wild-type and DNA-LigaseIVdeficient TRF2ts cells (Extended Data Fig. 5b-d), indicating it is not a passive consequence
of lack of NHEJ-mediated overhang degradation, but represents an active role of MAD2L2
in inhibiting 5′ end-resection. 5′ DNA end-resection is a powerful obstruction to NHEJ by
creating DNA-ends unsuitable for ligation18, explaining why MAD2L2 depletion impairs
NHEJ-mediated repair.
5′ End-resection involves the combined activities of CTIP, MRN, EXO1, BLM and DNA2,
and is blocked by 53BP1 and its interaction partners RIF1 and PTIP3, 13, 19-24. In line with
MAD2L2 promoting NHEJ by impeding 5′ end-resection, co-depletion of CTIP or EXO1
with MAD2L2 partially reversed the increased survival of Mad2l2-knockdown cells
undergoing prolonged telomere uncapping (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 5e-h). Moreover,

consistent with the generation of longer single-stranded overhangs that block NHEJ and
prime for HDR, Mad2l2-knockdown cells showed elevated phosphorylation of the ATR
target CHK1 and of the single-strand DNA-binding protein RPA (Fig. 3g). In addition,
MAD2L2-depleted cells showed increased HDR at telomeres by elevated telomere sisterchromatid exchanges (TSCE, Extended Data Fig. 6a).

Because the effects of MAD2L2 depletion on end-resection, telomere fusion and CSR
resemble those of 53BP1, RIF1 and, to certain extent, PTIP inactivation3, 13, 19-24, we asked
whether MAD2L2 is epistatic with 53BP1, RIF1 or PTIP. Similarly, we addressed the
requirement of REV1 and REV3 for the ability of MAD2L2 to control end-resection and
telomere fusion. Unlike in wild-type or PTIP-deficient MEFs, MAD2L2 depletion did not
reduce fusion of TRF2-deprotected telomeres in 53BP1- or RIF1-deficient MEFs (Fig. 4a,
Extended Data Fig. 6b-e). However, MAD2L2-L186A and MAD2L2-C70R, respectively
defective in REV1 or REV3 interaction25, 26, were still capable of promoting telomere
fusion and telomere-driven genomic instability (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 7a,g,i).
Moreover, MAD2L2 depletion resulted in elevated RPA phosphorylation upon IR in wildtype, Ptip−/−, Rev1−/− or Rev3−/− MEFs, but not in 53bp1−/− or Rif1−/− MEFs (Fig.
4c). This indicates that MAD2L2 controls end-resection and fusion of deprotected telomeres
in a 53BP1 and RIF1 dependent, but PTIP, REV1 and REV3 independent manner.
Unanticipated, MAD2L2-depleted Rif1−/−MEFs showed an elevated background of
chromosome end fusion due to telomere association between sister-chromatids (Fig. 4a,
Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). The molecular nature of these sister-telomere associations remains
to be determined, but they occur irrespective of TRF2 inhibition and potentially reflect
replication problems27.

To further address the dependencies for MAD2L2 function in DNA repair, we investigated
the requirements for MAD2L2 accumulation to DSBs and NHEJ activity at telomeres. Both
DSB accumulation and the ability to promote telomere-driven genomic instability by
MAD2L2 require an intact HORMA domain and C-terminus, while potential S/TQ
phosphorylation on T103 appears dispensable (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 7). Interestingly,
while MAD2L2 accumulation to IR-induced DDR foci (IRIFs) was independent of PTIP or
interaction of MAD2L2 with REV1 or REV3, it clearly depended on ATM kinase activity,
RNF8, RNF168, 53BP1 and RIF1 (Fig. 4d,e, Extended Data Fig. 7c,e, 8). More specifically,
MAD2L2 IRIF accumulation required the HEAT repeats of RIF1 and the same ATM/ATR
phosphorylation sites in 53BP1 that promote RIF1 IRIFs, while those that promote PTIP
IRIFs were dispensable21-24 (Fig. 4f,g, Extended Data Fig. 9a-c). Similarly, MAD2L2
localization to uncapped telomeres required 53BP1 (Extended Data Fig. 8e). In line with
dependency on RIF1, whose localization to DSBs is strongly reduced in G2, MAD2L2 foci
were also diminished in G2, although less than RIF1 foci (Fig. 4h, Extended Data Fig. 9d).
The latter could relate to a proposed role for MAD2L2 in late steps of HDR28.
In addition to inhibiting end-resection, 53BP1, but not RIF1, promotes NHEJ by increasing
mobility of uncapped telomeres13, 20. Consistent with MAD2L2 acting via end-resection
control downstream of RIF1, MAD2L2-deficiency did not impair mobility of uncapped
telomeres (Extended Data Fig. 10a-c).

Altogether, our data identify MAD2L2 as an important regulator of DNA repair pathway
choice that promotes NHEJ at telomeres and DSBs in multiple settings, by inhibiting CTIP
and EXO1 dependent 5′ end-resection downstream of RIF1 (Extended Data Fig. 10d).
Whether MAD2L2 affects regulatory acetylation or phosphorylation of CTIP18, or blocks
other end-resection factors, awaits further investigation.

MAD2L2 and REV3 together compose Polζ and act with REV1 in TLS to facilitate DNA
replication past blocking lesions4. Based on reduced gene conversion and impaired DSB,
RPA and RAD51 foci resolution in REV1- and Polζ-depleted cells, it has been proposed that
the ability of REV1/Polζ to alleviate replication stalling might also be important during
HDR repair-synthesis28. Although requiring further characterization, together with the data
presented here, this suggests differential roles for MAD2L2 in DSB repair. As shown here,
MAD2L2 acts downstream of 53BP1/RIF1 in a REV1/REV3-independent manner to
promote NHEJ by inhibiting resection, mostly in G1. In addition, MAD2L2, as part of Polζ,
might promote HDR by facilitating replication of damaged DNA formed after resection in
G2.
The contribution of MAD2L2 to DNA repair at uncapped telomeres and DSBs suggests that
aberrant MAD2L2 expression could have pathological consequences by compromising
genome integrity. In this respect it is interesting that in particular MAD2L2, more than
REV1 or REV3, is reported overexpressed in multiple cancers and has prognostic
significance (ref29 and Oncomine database). Furthermore, our finding that MAD2L2 is
essential for CSR identifies MAD2L2 as a potential disease-susceptibility gene for human
primary immunodeficiencies.

Trf2−/−;p53−/−;TRF2ts mouse embryo fibroblasts (in short TRF2ts MEFs) were infected
in triplicate with PLKO lentiviral shRNA pools consisting of 1,976 shRNAs selected from
the Mouse TRC 1.0 Collection. Cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection below 1
and drug selected on 4 μg/ml puromycin. After completion of selection, TRF2ts MEFs were
plated in duplicate on 15 cm dishes at 150.000 cells per dish and allowed to adhere at 32°C.
One set of plates was kept at 32°C for 4 additional days, the other set of plates was subjected
to 12 days of telomere uncapping at 39°C, followed by recovery for 4 additional days at
32°C. Cells were harvested for genomic DNA isolation using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit
(Qiagen) and shRNA inserts were recovered from genomic DNA by 2 sequential PCR
amplifications (PCR1 and PCR2). In PCR1 6 individual PCR reactions were performed on
325 ng genomic DNA using for each sample a common reverse primer P7_PLKO1_R (5′CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATTTCTTTCCCCTGCACTGTACCC-3′) and 1 of 6

were pooled per condition, purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit (Qiagen), analyzed
on a bioanalyzer for quality and concentration, and subjected to deep-sequencing on a
Illumina Hiseq2000 genome analyzer at the NKI Genomics Core Facility.
Cell culture, growth assays, flow-cytometry
Trf2−/−;p53−/−;TRF2ts MEFs (TRF2ts MEFs) and Trf2−/−;p53−/−;Lig4−/−;TRF2ts
MEFs (TRF2ts;Lig4−/− MEFs) were generated as described before11. All cells were grown
in DMEM with 100 U penicillin, 0.1 mg ml−1 streptomycin, 2 mM l-glutamine and 10%
FBS. TRF2ts MEFs were maintained at the permissive temperature of 32°C and only grown
at 37°C or 39°C to induce telomere uncapping through inactivation of TRF2. All other cells
were grown at 37°C. Wild-type, 53bp1−/−, Rif1−/−, Ptip+/+ and Ptip−/− MEFs were
SV40 immortalized.

For colony survival assays, TRF2ts MEFs were plated at 150,000 cells per 15 cm dish or
45,000 per 10 cm dish, allowed to adhere and kept at 32°C or placed at 39°C. To evaluate
potential toxicity or growth rate differences, plates were fixed with 10% formalin and
stained with 0.1% crystal violet after growth for 1 week at 32°C. To evaluate survival upon
prolonged telomere uncapping plates were fixed and stained after growth for 12 days at
39°C, followed by 0 or 2 weeks recovery at 32°C. Quantifications of survival assays reflect
the relative survival after growth for 12 days at 39°C and 2 weeks recovery at 32°C,
corrected for plating efficiency and growth at 32°C and assessed by crystal violet extraction
as described below.
To address cell survival under telomere uncapping conditions in short term growth assays,
TRF2ts MEFs were plated in quadruplicate at 5,000 cells per well on a 12-well plate (Fig.
1c) or in duplicate at 2,500 cells per well on a 24-wells plate (Extended Data Fig. 5h),
allowed to adhere overnight at 32°C and then placed for 12-14 days at 39°C. During this
time period of non-permissive temperature, plates were fixed every 2-4 days with 10%
formalin and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Crystal violet was extracted from the plates
using 10% acetic acid and its absorbance at 595 nm was quantified using a Tecan microplate
reader. Quantifications were corrected for plating efficiency.
Cell cycle distribution of TRF2ts MEFs with or without Mad2l2 knockdown was determined
by propidium-iodide (PI) staining, as well as by BrdU incorporation, and acquired on a BD
Fortessa using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar,
Ashland, OR) software.

For IF cells were grown on eight-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and in cases of MAD2L2
detection first pre-extracted for 30 s to 5 min with 0.5% Triton/PBS on ice, then fixed for 10
min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized for 5 min (MEFs) or 10 min
(U2OS) in 0.5% Triton/PBS, washed twice in PBS, incubated for 1 h in blocking solution
(0.02% Triton, 5% NGS, 5% FCS in PBS) and overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies in

0.02% Triton/PBS, slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing
DAPI. Confocal fluorescence images were obtained on a Leica SP5 confocal system
equipped with an Ar, Kr and HeNe laser system. Images were taken with a 63x NA 1.32 oil
objective and standard LAS-AF software. Possible crosstalk between fluorochromes was
avoided by careful selection of imaging conditions. A minimum of 100 cells per condition
per experiment was analysed. DDR foci in MEFs were captured using the Metafer4/
MetaCyte platform (MetaSystems, Germany) equipped with an AxioImager Z2 microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Germany). Images of random selections of cells were acquired with an EC
‘Plan-Neofluar’ 40x/0,75 objective. Analysis was done using MetaCyte software, carefully
fine-tuned for each antibody. A minimum of 500 cells was analysed per condition per

For monitoring mitotic telomeres by PNA FISH, IMR90 (E6/E7) cells were transduced with
pMX-Flag-53BP1 (1-1711) or its mutant T1608A/S1618A (TASA) and pMX-GFP-RNF8 or
its mutant T198A and selected with 0.2 μg/ml puromycin, for 3 days before plating. Cells
were transfected with siRNAs targeting endogenous RNF8 (ThermoFisher, D-006900-01,
target sequence: 5′-AGAAUGAGCUCCAAUGUAUUU-3′) and 53BP1 (ThermoFisher,
D-003548-01, target sequence: 5′-GAGAGCAGAUGAUCCUUUA-3′) and the following
siRNAs: PTIP siRNA pool (ThermoFisher, D-012795-01-0010, target sequences: 5′UUAAAGCGAGCAAGUAUUA-3′, 5′-GAGCCUGGGUUGAUUAACU-3′, 5′GUUGAUGAGUAUAAGACUA-3′ and 5′-GCCAAUGCAGUGCUGUUUA-3′), RIF1

double-thymidine block. Cells were subsequently processed as previously described16.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and in-gel detection of telomeric DNA

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Analysis of 3′ single-strand G-overhangs at mouse telomeres was performed as described5
by pulse-field gel electrophoresis and in-gel hybridisation of a 32P-labelled telomeric repeat
(CCCTAA)4 oligonucleotide to native DNA. Briefly, Trf2−/−; p53−/−;TRF2ts MEFs were
harvested at the permissive temperature as well as after growth at the non-permissive
temperature. Agarose plugs were prepared containing 1 × 106 cells per plug and digested
overnight with 1 mg ml−1 proteinase K at 50 °C. Before loading on a 1% agarose gel, plugs
were digested overnight with 60 U of MboI enzyme per plug. After running the gel on a
CHEF-DR III pulsed-field gel electrophoresis system (BioRad), the gel was dried, prehybridized in Church Mix containing 7% SDS and hybridized overnight with a 32P-labeled
(CCCTAA)4 probe, all under non-denaturing conditions. Signal was captured on a
phosphorimager and analyzed with AIDA Image Analyzer software. To confirm that the Goverhang signal detected with this method was indeed derived from 3′ single-stranded
telomeric TTAGGG repeats, digestion with 3′ Exonuclease and hybridization with a 32Plabeled (TTAGGG)4 probe specific for the C-rich strand was performed on separate plugs.
After capturing the hybridization signal from single-stranded telomeric DNA, the gel was
denatured and re-hybridized with the same probes to obtain a total telomere signal for the
purpose of quantification.
Repair and clonogenic survival assays
To quantify the repair of DSBs by NHEJ, U2OS cells transduced with shRNAs were
transfected with pEJ5-GFP (NHEJ), as well as an mCherry expression vector and pCAGGSIsce-I-Trex230. Transfections were done using Mirus TransIT LT-1 (Mirus Bio LLC, USA).
The fraction of mCherry-positive cells that was GFP-positive was determined 72 h posttransfection by flow-cytometry on a BD LSRFortessa using FACSDiva software.
Quantification was carried out with FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).

For random plasmid integration assays 500,000 U2OS cells were seeded in 6 cm dishes 24 h
prior to transfection with 3.9 μg of NdeI-linearized pMSCVblas-GFP and 0.1 μg of mCherry
plasmids using ViaFect (Promega). Transfected cells were trypsinized the following day and
seeded in 10 cm dishes at different densities for colony formation. Selection was initiated
the following day with blasticidin at 5 ug/ml. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) 10-14 days after plating and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colony counting was
performed on a ColCount (Oxford Optronix) and values were normalized for plating and
transfection efficiencies.
For clonogenic survival assays U2OS cells were seeded in duplicate in 6-well plates at 100,
200, and 400 cells per well for unirradiated cells, and at 400, 800, and 1600 cells per well
for irradiated cells. Cells were grown for <20 h before gamma-irradiation and then fixed
after 10-12 days of recovery with 4% PFA and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colonies
with >50 cells were counted on a GelCount (Oxford Optronix) and the surviving fraction
was determined.
CSR assays

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Research involving animals was performed in accordance with protocols approved by the
animal facility at Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics (Toronto). Primary B cell extraction
was performed as described before23. Briefly, mature B-lymphocytes were isolated from
spleens of 8-12 week old C57BL/6 mice by depletion of CD43+ cells using CD43
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified B cells
were resuspended at a concentration of 106 cells/ml in the presence of 25 μg/ml LPS
(Sigma-Aldrich) to allow B cell proliferation. Both mouse CH12F3-231 and primary B cells
were infected with lentiviral/retroviral particles obtained from the supernatant of HEK293T
cell cultures cotransfected with the lentiviral/retroviral shRNA constructs and the vector
expressing MLV Gag-Pol (for retrovirus) or the lentiviral psPAX2 packaging vector with
VSV-G envelope (2:1:1 ratio). Briefly, the viral supernatant was concentrated at 25,000 g
for 90 min at 25°C before resuspension in RPMI culture medium. Infection was
subsequently performed as described23 and followed by selection with puromycin.
IgM to IgA switching was assayed in CH12F3-2 cells activated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1
(Preprotech), 10 ng/ml IL-4 (Preprotech) and 1 μg/ml agonist anti-CD40 (BD). IgA
expression was measured by flow-cytometry using biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgA
antibody (1:200; eBioscience) followed by an anti-biotin-APC antibody at 0, 24 and 48h
post-activation. Proliferation of the different transduced CH12F3-2 cell lines was performed
using CFSE (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. CSR assays in both cell
types were done in triplicate for every independent experiment. Ex-vivo isotype switching to
IgG1 in primary B cells was assayed by flow-cytometry using an anti-IgG1-biotin (1:200;
BD) followed by APC-conjugated anti-biotin (Miltenyi Biotech) and 10 μg/ml propidium
iodide 5 days post-isolation.
For semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of AID mRNA, IgM and IgA germline transcripts
total RNA was extracted with TRIzol® (Invitrogen) and cDNA was synthesized by random
priming using the Superscript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Mouse Aicda
transcripts were amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-GTGCCACCTCCTGCTCACTGG-3′

and 5′-TTCATGTAGCCCTTCCCAGGC-3′. IgM (μ) germline transcripts were amplified
using oligonucleotides 5′-AAAATGTCCGCTGGGCTAAG-3′ and 5′AGAACAGTCCAGTGTAGGCAGTAGA-3′, IgA (Iα) using 5′CCTGGCTGTTCCCCTATGAA-3′ and 5′-GAGCTGGTGGGAGTGTCAGTG-3′ and
Gapdh transcripts were amplified using oligonucleotides
5′AGCCTCGTCCCGTAGACAA-3′ and 5′-AATCTCCACTTTGCCACTGC-3′. 53BP1
depletion is known to impair CSR3 and was included as control.
TSCE analysis
Telomere sister-chromatid exchanges were detected by chromosome-orientation FISH (COFISH), essentially as described32 with minor modifications. In brief, for CO-FISH cells were
grown in 10 μM BrdU:BrdC (3:1) for 24 h with the addition of 0.2 μg/ml demecolcine for
the final 2 h. Slides were treated with RNAse A (0.5 mg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C, stained
with Hoechst 33258 (0.5 μg/ml) in 2xSSC for 15 min at room temperature and exposed to
5.4e3 J/m2 365-nm UV light (Stratalinker 2400 UV irradiator). Following digestion with
Exonuclease III (10 U/μl, Promega, Madison, WI) for 10 min at room temperature, slides
were dehydrated through an ethanol series (70%, 95% and 100%) and incubated sequentially
with Cy3-TelG 5′-[TTAGGG]3-3′ and FITC-TelC 5′-[CCCTAA]3-3′ probes at room
temperature.
Telomere mobility

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Telomere mobility analysis was done as described13 with minor adjustments. TRF2ts cells
expressing eGFP-TRF1 and mCherry-BP1-2 (53BP1 aa 1220-1711) were seeded on Willco
wells and left to attach overnight at 32°C. Prior to imaging, cells were incubated at 37°C for
30 min in Leibovitz’s L15 medium inside the Microscope climate chamber. Cells were
monitored every minute for 20 min (t=20 frames) at 37°C. 5 μm Z-stacks at 0.5 μm steps in
both eGFP and mCherry channels were obtained with a 63x 1.4 oil objective using ZEN
software on an Observer Z1 microscope system (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Images were
obtained at 2×2 binning with 512×512 pixels. Tracking of telomeres was performed with
FIJI software, cells were registered with the Rigid body option from the StackReg plugin.
Particles were then tracked with the particle detector and tracker plugin from Mosaic.
Telomeres to track were selected on basis of colocalization with mCherry-BP1-2, and
tracked for at least 17 out of 20 frames.
