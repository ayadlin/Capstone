BACKGROUND: Tumor suppressor gene product RASSF1A has been reported to induce mitotic arrest and
apoptosis through its interaction with microtubule and binding to the Ras effector NORE1. Despite this
promising antitumor action of microtubule-targeted drugs, clinical studies demonstrated that paclitaxel
(TXL) and vincristine (VCS) have differential antitumor effects, depending on the status of microtubulerelated genes in lung cancer patients. In this study, to provide effective chemotherapeutic treatment for
lung cancer patients with the microtubule-targeted drugs, the authors investigated whether RASSF1A
could enhance sensitivity to TXL and VCS, as an intrinsic microtubule modulator, in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. METHODS: The growth inhibitory effects of TXL and VCS on RASSF1A-transfected cells
were assessed using clonogenic and flow cytometry–based propidium iodide–labeled assay. The levels of
mitosis-related proteins in RASSF1A-transfected cells after treatment with TXL or VCS were examined by
Western blot analysis and in vitro kinase assay. RESULTS: RASSF1A enhanced the growth inhibitory effect
of TXL and VCS on NSCLC cells and bronchial epithelial transformed cells (BEAS-2B) by inducing cell cycle
arrest at the G2/M-phase. Accumulation of cyclin B1, G2/M-phase–related protein, was observed when
RASSF1A-transfected H1299 cells were treated with TXL or VCS, accompanied with an increase of cyclin A.
Inhibition of the activity of cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex by RASSF1A and TXL or VCS was confirmed by kinase
assay and knockdown of RASSF1A expression by using small interfering RNA. CONCLUSIONS: RSAAF1A
protein has a cooperative growth inhibitory effect with microtubule-targeted drugs through cyclin B1 accumulation on NSCLC cells, suggesting novel insights for the selection of chemotherapeutic agents. Cancer

Lung cancer is 1 of the leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide.1,2 The incidence of lung cancer in
Korea is the second highest among all cancers, and is increasing rapidly.3 The overall 5-year survival rate of
lung cancer patients is poor (<15%), because diagnosis is generally made at a late stage, and chemotherapy
is inefficient.4 Despite the introduction of novel agents and the combined treatment modalities using surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, most patients diagnosed with advanced stage nonsmall cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) do not survive for >2 years.5 To overcome the poor outcome of NSCLC, an accurate

therapeutic approach at the molecular level is necessary to
achieve better treatment efficacy in lung cancer patients.
Although the precise molecular mechanisms for the
development of lung cancer are unclear, it is believed that
silencing of tumor suppressor genes by aberrant DNA
methylation is 1 of the major genetic causes of lung carcinogenesis.6,7 RASSF1A is 1 of the tumor suppressor genes
located on chromosome 3p21.3. It is produced by alternative mRNA splicing of human RASSF1, and is found to
inhibit the growth of lung cancer cells both in vitro and
in vivo.7 The methylation of CpG islands in the RASSF1A
promoter has also been found in primary NSCLCs (3040%),7,8 as well as in more than 40 types of sporadic
human cancers.8,9 In addition, some studies have shown
that RASSF1A methylation correlates with poor survival
rate and is associated with poorly differentiated tumors,
predominantly with vascular invasion and pleural involvement in NSCLC.10 These observations suggest that genetic
inactivation of RASS1A is an important mechanism for the
development and progression of lung cancer.
The tumor suppressive effect of RASSF1A has been
reported to be mediated by its 2 important roles; induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.11-14 RASSF1A is
believed to induce apoptosis through its interaction with
Ras, NORE 1, CNK1, MST1, and the modulator apoptosis-1.13,15-17 Mitotic progression is regulated at the
G1/S-phase by interaction of RASSF1A with the transcriptional factor p120E4F and inhibition of cyclin D
accumulation.18,19 RASSF1A also induces cell cycle arrest
at the G2/M-phase by inhibiting the APC-Cdc20 ubiquitin ligase complex and its degradation of cyclin A or B.14
Moreover, RASSF1A has been implicated to modulate
microtubule dynamics through its interaction with microtubule and intrinsic microtubule-associated proteins,
which are mechanisms similar to those of microtubuletargeted agents.11,20-23 Recently, re-expression of
RASSF1A into a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line,
SMMC-7721, has been shown to markedly reduce the resistance to cisplatin and mitomycin, which was accompanied by G1 phase arrest.24 Thus, it is likely that RASSF1A
protein may enhance the effect on the cell cycle arrest with
anticancer drugs, resulting in increased sensitivity to
chemotherapy.
Microtubule-targeted drugs, including paclitaxel
(TXL) and vinca alkaloids, are 1 of the most effective groups
of chemotherapeutic agents in lung cancer.23,25 Although
1254

these compounds are classified into 2 main groups; microtubule ‘‘stabilizers’’ and ‘‘destabilizers,’’ their antiproliferative
effects on cancer cells can be synergistic or additive when
combined with other drugs that have either the same or opposite action on microtubule masses. The surprising synergy
of microtubule-targeted drugs has also been confirmed in
clinical studies.26 However, there are still unsolved questions
regarding the antitumor effects of microtubule-targeted
drugs on the factors that determine intrinsic sensitivity in
lung cancer patients. Therefore, it is an important clinical
issue to investigate molecular markers that can be used for
the selection of appropriate chemotherapeutic agents. In the
current study, we hypothesized that an intrinsic microtubule
modulator, RASSF1A, might synergistically or additively
act with the microtubule-targeted drugs TXL and vincristine (VCS) in lung cancer cells to induce increased cell death
and cell cycle arrest. Our study demonstrated that reintroduction of RASSF1A in NSCLC cells enhanced antitumor
effects of TXL and VCS by arresting the cells at the G2/Mphase, and that the antimitotic effects were associated with
cyclin B1 accumulation in lung cancer cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Cultures and Transfection
BEAS-2B, H1299, and A549 cells were obtained from the
American TypeCulture Collection (ATCC; Manassas,
Va). The BEAS-2B cells were cultured in serum-free keratinocyte medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) containing epidermal growth factor and bovine pituitary extract.
The H1299 and A549 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
medium and in Ham F12 medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), respectively. The day before transfection, the H1299, BEAS-2B, and A549 cells (5  105)
were plated on 60-mm plates. On the next day, the cells
were transiently transfected with 1 lg of RASSF1A DNA
(kindly provided by Dr. S Tommasi of the Beckman
Research Institute, Duarte, Calif) or the empty pcDNA
3.1 plasmid by using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and seeded for the
clonogenic assay or Western blot analysis. To generate
cells stably expressing RASSF1A, the H1299 cells were
transfected with 1 lg of RASSF1A DNA by using LipofectAMINE reagent, and colonies were selected from

culture by treating them with Geneticin (800 lg/mL)
(GIBCO). The selected colonies were maintained in a
medium containing Geneticin (200 lg/mL). Only low
passage cells (passage<10) were used for experiments.

Reagents and Antibodies
TXL and VCS were purchased from Sigma Chemical
Company (St. Louis, Mo). The anti-RASSF1A monoclonal antibody (eB114) was purchased from eBiosciences
(Minneapolis, Minn). Antibodies against cyclin B1, phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr-15), and phospho-Cdc25C (Ser-216)
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
Mass). Antibodies against cyclin A, Cdc2, and Cdc25C
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
(Santa Cruz, Calif). Anti–b-actin monoclonal antibody
(AC-74) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

Treatments and Viability Assay
BEAS-2B, H1299, and A549 cells were seeded at 5  105
cells/60-mm plate, with 10% FBS-containing medium.
The next day, H1299 cells were transiently transfected
with RASSF1A at various concentrations (0.5-5 lg
DNA). BEAS-2B and A549 cells were transiently transfected with 1 lg of RASSF1A DNA or the empty pcDNA
3.1 plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the
cells were harvested and seeded in 6-well plates at 2  104
cells per well for the viability assay. On the next day, the
cells were treated with TXL at concentrations of 5, 10,
and 15 nM or with VCS at concentrations of 2, 4, and 6
nM. Twenty-four, 48, and 72 hours after treatment, trypan blue–negative surviving cells were counted using an
optical microscope. The synergistic effect of RASSF1A
and TXL or VCS was determined by an isobologram analysis, calculated using a Calcusyn program (BIOSOFT,
Cambridge, UK). A combination index (CI) value <1
represents synergy between RASSF1A and TXL or VCS, a
CI value >1 indicates antagonism, and a CI value of 1
means that the effects of the 2 agent are additive.

Clonogenic Assay
After H1299 cells were transfected with RASSF1A, the
colonies were isolated after Geneticin selection, and the
RASSF1A expression level was confirmed by Western blot

analysis. After treatment with TXL or VCS at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 nM for 48 hours, the cells stably
expressing RASSF1A or control vector were reseeded at
1000 cells/60-mm plate. The cells were cultured with
fresh media when the colonies became visible. The cells
were then fixed with methanol for 15 minutes, and
washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The colonies
were then stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 1 hour,
rinsed with water, and finally counted using a Gel-doc
Colony Counter Image Analyzer (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
Calif).

Small Interfering RNA Assay
The double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide used for targeting RASSF1A was synthesized
by Ambion Inc. (Austin, Tex). The sequences used are
reported elsewhere18: sense 50 -GACCUCUGUGGCGA
CUUCAtt-30 and antisense 50 -UGAAGUCGCCACA
GAGGUCtt-30 . The BEAS-2B or H1299 cells stably
expressing RASSF1A were plated onto 6-well cell culture
plates in a normal growth medium or in a SiPORT Lipid
mixture (Ambion Inc.) containing 10 lg of siRNA or
control siRNA (Dharmacon, Chicago, Ill). After 12
hours, fresh normal growth medium was added to each
well to maximize cell growth and prevent potential cytotoxicity. Transfected cells were used for Western blot
analysis and in vitro kinase assay.

Western Blot Analysis
The expression of cyclin B1 after TXL and VCS treatment
was detected by incubating H1299 cells, transiently
expressing RASSF1A, in medium containing TXL and
VCS for 48 hours, and then harvesting at various times
(15 minutes, 3 hours, and 24 hours). For each experiment, the harvested cells were stored at 80 C until
needed. The collected cells were lysed with 10 lL of dilution buffer containing 20 mM 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (pH 7.2), 25 mM b-glycerophosphate, 5 mM
ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (100
lg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 lg/mL aprotinin, and 1 lg/mL leupeptin). The total cell lysates (50 lg)
were resolved on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto nitrocellulose

membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). Each membrane was incubated with appropriate primary antibodies. The bands were observed using a
peroxidase-linked enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All the experiments were repeated in triplicate.

In Vitro Kinase Assay
H1299 cells (1  106) were treated with either TXL or
VCS for 48 hours, as described above. They were then
washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The antibody against
cyclin B1 was used for immunoprecipitation from 500 lg
of cellular lysates prepared as described above. The reaction was performed at 30 C for 20 minutes in 20 lL of a
kinase reaction buffer containing diluted (c-32P) ATP (10
lCi/10 lL), cell lysates, and 0.5 lg of histone H1 (Sigma
Chemical Company) as substrate for cyclin B1. After
incubating the mixture, the reaction was quenched by
adding 20 lL of 2  SDS sample buffer, heated to 95 C
for 5 minutes, and then resolved by SDS–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis.

Cell Cycle Analysis
The cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide–labeled cells. The H1299
cells were seeded at 2.5  105 cells/60-mm plate and treated
with either TXL or VCS. The cells were harvested as
described above, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stored at
20 C until needed. The cells were then washed twice with
ice-cold PBS and incubated with ribonuclease and propidium iodide. Cell cycle analysis was performed by FACScan
flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif).

RESULTS
Reintroduction of RASSF1A to Lung Cancer
Cells Synergistically Enhances Growth
Inhibitory Effects of Microtubule-targeted
TXL and VCS
To investigate whether ectopic expression of RASSF1A
affects growth inhibitory effect of TXL or VCS on
RASSF1A-deficient lung cancer cells, we determined the
effects of each drug on survival of RASSF1A-transfected or
1256

control-transfected H1299 cells (Fig. 1A), and confirmed
the RASSF1A protein levels of each cell line transfected
with RASSF1A using Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). After
48 hours of treatment with TXL or VCS at each concentration, the number of viable cells in the groups of H1299 cells
transfected with RASSF1A decreased synergistically (Fig.
1A). The lower panel in Figure 1A shows the CI value
below 1 at all doses of the combination except for combination with 0.1 lg of RASSF1A DNA and 2 nM VCS (CI
value, 1.09), indicating synergism. To confirm the enhancing effect of RASSF1A on the cell growth, a nontumorigenic and endogenously RASSF1A-expressing cell line
(BEAS-2B) and another tumorigenic, RASSF1A-deficient
cell line (A549) were selected. All the cells were transiently
transfected with vectors, including RASSF1A or control
vectors, and protein expression was confirmed by Western
blot analysis. As shown in Figure 1B, reintroduction or
overexpression of RASSF1A in the cell lines greatly
decreased the number of viable cells after TXL or VCS
treatment, compared with the control vector-transfected
cells. A colony-forming assay was then performed on the
cells stably transfected with RASSF1A to determine whether
RASSF1A had the same effect on TXL- or VCS-induced
growth inhibition as was observed in the cells transiently
transfected with RASSF1A. The expression of RASSF1A
was verified by Western blot analysis in the 2 clones (Fig.
2A). A treatment of TXL or VCS showed a marked reduction of colony formation in the cells (clone-1 and clone-2)
stably transfected with RASSF1A, compared with the control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2B and C). In particular,
the inhibitory effects of the microtubule-targeted agents
and RASSF1A on cell survival were observed at very low
concentrations; >70% reduction in colony formation at 5
nM TXL and up to 50% at 1 nM VCS.

VCS for 24 hours, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M-phase was
more markedly induced in RASSF1A-transfected cells
than in vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 3A). This
result indicates that synergistic growth inhibition of
RASSF1A-transfected cells with TXL and VCS treatment
is accompanied with cell cycle arrest at the G2/M-phase.
It has been reported that RASSF1A in the A549 cell
line can induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M-phase by
accumulation of cyclin B1.14 Therefore, we first investiCancer

also induced by RASSF1A expression in H1299 cells. The
H1299 cells were transfected with various concentrations
of RASSF1A (0 lg; plasmid DNA of control vector, 0.5-5
lg; plasmid DNA of RASSF1A), and the protein levels of
RASSF1A and cyclin B1 were examined by using Western
blot analysis. As shown in Figure 3B, RASSF1A was efficiently expressed in the H1299 cells when transiently
transfected with RASSF1A, and maximum cyclin B1 protein expression was observed with 1 lg of RASSF1A plasmid DNA. This result is consistent with a previous report,

transfected with RASSF1A, but not observed in vectortransfected control cells (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, the same
pattern of induction and/or accumulation of cyclin A as
that of cyclin B1 was observed in the cells transfected with
RASSF1A after TXL treatment. Cyclin A expression was
significantly induced in RASSF1A-deficient cells by VCS,
not by TXL, and this phenomenon was pronounced in
the cells overexpressing RASSF1A by both VCS and TXL.
These findings indicate that the effect of RASSF1A and
TXL or VCS on G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest is associated
with the induction and/or accumulation of cyclin B1/A in
the H1299 cells transiently and stably transfected with
RASSF1A.

RASSF1A, compared with control vector-transfected cells.
Next, when RASSF1A was down-regulated by transient
transfection of the cells with siRNA, the cyclin B1/Cdc2
kinase activity was completely restored (Fig. 5B).
Although TXL and VCS had effects similar to that of
RASSF1A on the phosphorylation of cyclin B1/Cdc2, the
kinase activity was completely recovered by abrogation of
RASSF1A expression, which was not affected by the
microtubule-targeted agents at the time point that we performed the kinase assay. This implies that RASSF1A
induces decrease of the kinase activity of the cyclin B1/
Cdc2 complex, most likely by phosphorylation of Cdc2
and Cdc25.

Effect of RASSF1A and TXL or VCS on the
Activities of Cdc2 and Cdc25C

DISCUSSION

It is known that the activation of cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase
and entry into mitosis require dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites of Cdc2 by Cdc25 phosphatase. In eukaryotes,
Cdc25C is inhibited by phosphorylation at a single site, serine-216 (Ser-216).29,30 Thus, we investigated whether
RASSF1A and TXL or VCS have any effect on the activity
of Cdc2 and phosphatase Cdc25C using Western blot analysis. Treatment with TXL or VCS led to induction of
phosphorylated Cdc25C and subsequently that of phosphorylation of Cdc2 in vector-transfected H1299 cells
(Fig. 4). In the cells transfected with RASSF1A, however,
basal levels of phosphorylated Cdc2 and Cdc25C were
higher than those of the control vector-transfected cells,
and their phosphorylation levels were further increased by
TXL or VCS treatment. These results indicate that TXL
and VCS inhibit Cdc2/Cdc25C activity by phosphorylating the kinases, and that their effects are greatly enhanced
in the RASSF1A overexpressing cells.

siRNA-mediated Inhibition of RASSF1A
Expression Restores the Kinase Activity of
the Cyclin B1/Cdc2 Complex
To verify the effect of RASSF1A on the activity of the
cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex, RASSF1A siRNA was used to
inhibit RASSF1A expression, as previously reported18
(Fig. 5A). As shown in Figure 5B, in vitro kinase assay
revealed that the kinase activity of cyclin B1/Cdc2 was
markedly decreased in the cells stably transfected with
1262

In this study, we demonstrated that the reintroduction or
overexpression of RASSF1A enhanced growth inhibitory
effect of microtubule-targeted TXL or VCS in RASSF1Adeficient lung cancer cells. The synergistic effect of the
strong microtubule-targeted drugs and RASSF1A was
mediated by blockade of cell cycle; therefore, the cells
transfected with RASSF1A were more markedly arrested
at the G2/M-phase by TXL or VCS treatment. Moreover,
the induction of cyclin A and B1 proteins in this cell population was more profound than in the RASSF1A-deficient cells, indicating synergism of the microtubuletargeted drugs and RASSF1A on the cell cycle progression
in association with accumulation of cyclin A or B1 at the
G2/M-phase. In addition, RASSF1A induced decrease of
the kinase activity of the cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex, which
is an essential component required for a cell to enter into
mitosis,31 most likely by phosphorylation of Cdc2 and
Cdc25. We observed that accumulation of cyclin B1 protein occurred mainly in the cytosolic compartment by
using immunofluorescence analysis and was enhanced in
the RASSF1A-transfected cells with TXL or VCS treatment (data not shown). Furthermore, TXL and VCS
greatly enhanced the inhibitory effect of RASSF1A on the
Cdc2/Cdc25C activity by phosphorylating kinases in
H1299 cells. Together, our findings suggest that
RASSF1A protein can enhance the cell cycle arrest at the
G2/M phase in cells when treated with microtubuletargeted agents.

VCS, are among the most successful drugs in lung cancer

cellular microtubule mass through opposite mechanisms.
However, the depolymerizing or polymerizing effects of
VCS and TXL were observed at high concentrations of
the drugs, thereby leaving the dividing cells blocked in mitosis with condensed chromosomes or microtubule bundling. For instance, depolymerization of microtubules
was observed at 10 to 100 nM vinca alkaloids and

FIGURE 5. RASSF1A inhibits kinase activity of the cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex. (A) H1299 cells stably transfected with RASSF1A were
treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) specifically targeting the RASSF1A transcript. After treatment with paclitaxel (TXL) or
vincristine (VCS), RASSF1A expression was analyzed by Western blot analysis. b-Actin was used as internal loading control. (B) In
vitro kinase assays were performed using a histone H1 as a substrate for cyclin B1. The input of histone H1 substrate is shown in
Coomassie staining. The bar graph shows the level of cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex activity. The average band densities were measured
by Gel-doc Image Analyzer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif) using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Vector indicates H1299 cells stably

suppression of microtubule dynamics, rather than increasing or decreasing microtubule mass. However, the precise
mechanism by which the microtubule-targeted agents at
very low concentrations suppress microtubule dynamics is
still unclear. Our present observations that low concentrations of VCS and TXL induce the cell cycle arrest at the
G2/M-phase in association with the induction of cyclin
B1 and cyclin A may provide deeper insights into the
mechanism by which the clinically relevant concentrations of the microtubule-targeted agents work.
RASSF1A has been suggested as an important cell
cycle regulator. Previous studies consistently suggest that
exogenous RASSF1A induces cell cycle arrest at the G1
phase most likely by inhibition of cyclin D accumulation.18,19 More recently, further studies revealed that
RASSF1A protein can also induce mitotic arrest at the
G2/M-phase by means of its interaction with microtubules.28 However, the precise mechanism by which
RASSF1A induces primarily mitotic arrest at the G2/Mphase remains controversial.14,36 In the current study, we
have found that RASSF1A per se decreased the kinase activity of the cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex, which appeared to
be caused by phosphorylation of Cdc2 and Cdc25, and
then induced cell cycle arrest of H1299 cells at the G2/Mphase. These intrinsic effects of RASSF1A on the cell cycle
were greatly enhanced by microtubule-targeted drugs,
which is a novel finding in this study. Therefore, further
studies are needed to determine whether patients with
NSCLC harboring RASSF1A deficiencies may respond
differently to treatment regimens involving microtubuletargeted agents.
The results of the current study have demonstrated
that RASSF1A might enhance the chemotherapeutic
effect of microtubule-targeted agents by functioning as a
cooperative inducer of G2/M arrest in H1299 cells. Reintroduction of 1 tumor suppressor function may not be a
major determinant; nevertheless, it can potentially add
some background knowledge on the different efficacy of
microtubule-targeted agents in patients with NSCLC.
