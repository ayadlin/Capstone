ABSTRACT
Progression of aggressive prostate cancers (PCa) with androgen receptor splice
variants or neuroendrocrine features is currently untreatable in the clinic. Therefore
novel therapies are urgently required. We conducted RNA-seq using tumors from a
unique murine transplant mouse model which spontaneously progresses to metastatic
disease. Differential gene expression analysis revealed a significant increase of
topoisomerase IIα, Top2a (Top2a) in metastatic tumors. Interrogation of human
data revealed that increased Top2a expression in primary tumors selected patients
with more aggressive disease. Further, significant positive correlation was observed
between Top2a and the histone methyltransferase, Ezh2. Combination of the Top2
poison etoposide with the Ezh2 inhibitor GSK126 or DZNep significantly increased
cell death in vitro in murine and human prostate cancer cell lines. Additionally,
combination therapy extended time to progression and increased therapeutic efficacy
in vivo. Overall, our studies demonstrate that patients screened for Top2a and Ezh2
expression would exhibit significant response to a combinational treatment involving
low dose etoposide combined with Ezh2 inhibition. In addition, our data suggests
that this combination therapeutic strategy is beneficial against aggressive PCa, and
provides strong rationale for continued clinical development.

in DNA replication, transcription, recombination and
chromatin remodeling [4]. Given the important role of
Top2a in these processes it is not surprising that Top2a
has been implicated in multiple cancers [5]. Specifically,
Top2a has been demonstrated to be a prognostic marker
for PCa prognosis [6, 7], and is significantly up-regulated
in multiple metastatic human PCa datasets [8]. The Top2
poison, etoposide in combination with estramustine was
previously included by the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) as a standard of care treatment
for castrate resistant PCa with or without neuroendocrine
features [9, 10]. However, current clinical data, while
promising, remains to determine the most beneficial use
of etoposide in patients with advanced PCa [11-14].
We identify Top2a as a significantly up-regulated
transcript in metastatic tumors from a transplantable PCa
mouse model of spontaneous metastasis [15]. Analysis of
patient data demonstrated that increased Top2a mRNA in
primary tumors selects for patients with aggressive PCa,
and identified a positive correlation between Top2a and
the histone methyltrasferase, Ezh2. For this reason we
tested Top2 and Ezh2 combination inhibition against PCa
models in vitro and in vivo, which harbor amplified AR,
ARv or neuroendocrine features.

Topoisomerase IIα (Top2a) mRNA is increased in
murine and human metastatic prostate cancer
To identify changes in gene expression between
primary and metastatic Myc-CaP tumors (aggressive
disease progression), we examined primary (n=3) and
metastatic tumor tissue (n=4) collected from tumor bearing
mice. Gene expression evaluation revealed a total of 254
genes were differentially expressed between metastatic
tumors compared to primary tumors. Further, 203 genes
(79.92%) displayed increased expression, while 51 genes
(20.08%) displayed decreased expression in metastatic
tumors (Figure 1A). Examination of our 254 gene
signature by DAVID gene ontology (GO) analysis software
revealed an enrichment of terms predominately associated
with chromosome and DNA processes (supplement
Figure 1a and b). From our performed DAVID analysis,
we focused our attention on topoisomerase IIα (Top2a)
for further evaluation. Top2a (Top2a) mRNA expression
from our normalized RNA-seq counts was increased in
metastatic tumors (Figure 1B). This significant increase
of Top2a expression was validated by qRT-PCR from
RNA samples used for RNA-seq, as well as additional

independent tumor samples (p=0.04) (Figure 1C). To add
clinical significance to our initial findings, we investigated
the mRNA expression of Top2a in a recently published
dataset of human prostate cancer from Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, GEO: GSE211032)
[16]. In line with our mouse data, human metastatic
prostate cancer exhibited significantly increased mRNA
expression of Top2a compared to primary tumors (Figure
1D, p<0.0001) [16].

hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis
using the top 100 differentially expressed genes from
Top2a high and Top2a low primary prostate tumors
(Figure 2B). Based on this analysis we could successfully
separate patients based on Top2a mRNA expression levels.

Increased Top2a mRNA selects for patients with
aggressive PCa

We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
with our Top2a high human gene signature and found
enrichment of a gene signature involving the histone
methlytransferase, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2)
[17] (Figure 2C). We further confirmed association of
Top2a and Ezh2 by first observing that primary human
tumors with increased Top2a mRNA concurrently
displayed significantly increased mRNA levels of
Ezh2. Spearman correlation analysis validated further a
significant positive association between levels of Top2a
and Ezh2 mRNA levels in 2 independent human primary
tumor datasets [16, 18, 19] (Figure 2D).

Patients with high Top2a mRNA demonstrate
positive correlation with increased Ezh2 mRNA

Further in silico analysis of primary patient tumors
from the MSKCC data set (n=131) revealed that Top2a
mRNA was elevated in 29% of patients (38/131 tumors),
and could identify patients with aggressive disease (Figure
2A; p=0.005).
We next examined whether differences in Top2a
expression in primary prostate tumor samples could
identify distinct patient populations. For this, we generated
differential gene signatures from patient primary tumors
with high Top2a mRNA expression (Top2a high, n=38)
and patient primary tumors without altered Top2a mRNA
expression (Top2a low, n=93). We performed supervised

Targeting of Top2 and Ezh2 in combination
demonstrates superior anti-tumor activity in vitro
and in vivo

cellular aneuploidy (>4N DNA content) and greatest loss
of S phase within the diploid cell population (supplement
Figure 2C and Figure 3B). This response within the cell
cycle was primary mediated by etoposide or combination
treatment. Further, both GSK126 and combination
treatment resulted in loss of Ezh2 methyl-transferase
activity as indicated by loss of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (Figure 3C).
Etoposide induces cytotoxic activity through
interaction with Top2, forming complexes that prevent
relegation of DNA; ultimately resulting in double strand
DNA breaks [24]. We examined DNA double strand break
(DNA-DSB) accumulation following drug treatments
by p-ɣH2AX protein expression. As expected, etoposide
increased DNA-DSB accumulation and this increase was
maintained in combination treatment (Figure 3C).
Finally, the anti-tumor activity of etoposide in
combination with the Ezh2 inhibitor DZNep [25] was
evaluated in vivo. Tumor bearing mice were treated with

The Top2 poison etoposide and the Ezh2 inhibitor
GSK126 [20] were both tested in vitro for their ability to
induce cell death in the murine and human PCa cell lines,
Myc-CaP [21] and LnCaP [22]. Cell death in response to
GSK126 in both cell lines occurred in a dose dependent
manner, whereas etoposide induced cell death in both cell
lines was time and dose dependent (supplement Figure
3a and b). Combination of non-cytotoxic concentrations
of etoposide with GSK126 resulted in a significant
increase in cell death in murine PCa cell lines MycCaP and TRAMP-C2 [23], and the human PCa cell line
LnCaP (p<0.05). Cell cycle analysis revealed that all
cell lines displayed a similar response to drug treatment.
This response was demonstrated by a strong induction of

or histone extractions (lower panels) were generated to perform immunoblot analysis for Ezh2, H3K27me3 and p-ɣH2AX expression was

vehicle (5% DMSO/PBS; 2x week), etoposide (10mg/
kg i.p.: day 1-5), DZNep (5mg/kg i.p.: 2x week) or
combination. No significant toxicity was observed in all
therapy studies as shown by body weight measurement
(supplement Figure 4A and 5A). Combination treatment
of mice bearing Myc-CaP tumors resulted in significant
delay in time to progression (p=0.002) (Figure 4a and
supplement Figure 4B). Specifically, tumor bearing
animals treated with vehicle had a median time to
progression of 12 days. Both etoposide and DZNep did
not result in significant antitumor activity as treated
mice with either therapy displayed a median time to
progression of 14 days. However, combination therapy
extended median time to progression to 18 days. Analysis
of hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained Myc-CaP tumor
samples showed a larger accumulation of apoptotic cells
within the combination treatment cohort (supplement
Figure 4C). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for

p-ɣH2AX further indicated dominant therapeutic efficacy
of etoposide combined with DZNep resulted in significant
increase in DNA-DSB (p<0.0001) (Figure 4B).
In line with our Myc-CaP tumor study, combination
treatment of mice bearing TRAMP-C2 tumors
significantly delayed tumor growth (p<0.0001) (Figure
4C and supplement Figure 5c). End point tumor weight
analysis revealed superior combination therapy over either
single treatment. Combination therapy resulted in a 38%
and 57% tumor reduction in comparison to etoposide and
DZNep respectively (DZNep vs. combo p=0.01; etoposide
vs. combo p=0.02; supplement Figure 5b). IHC analysis
of TRAMP-C2 tumors also displayed loss of H3K27me3
by DZNep and combination treatment groups, and a
superior reduction in tumor proliferation by combination
treatment (supplement Figure 5d). Like Myc-CaP tumors,
combination treatment also resulted in a significant
increase of DNA-DSB in TRAMP-C2 tumors (Figure 4D).

mice received 1x106 Myc-CaP or TRAMP-C2 respectively by subcutaneous injection. All mice were divided into the following treatment
cohorts: Vehicle (VEH: 5% DMSO/PBS, n=8), Etoposide (ETP: 10mg/kg i.p., d1-5, n=8), DZNep (DZ: 5mg/kg i.p., 2x week, n=8) or
combination (n=8). (A) Combination therapy significantly delayed time to progression in mice bearing Myc-CaP tumors, p=0.002 (time

DISCUSSION

It is known that both Top2a and Ezh2 (as part of
the polycomb repressive complex 2, PRC2) promote
proliferation and localize at DNA replication forks [31,
32]. We demonstrate in vitro that increased accumulation
of DNA-DSBs, aneuploidy and loss of S phase cells
indicate that our observed anti-tumor activities are a result
of disruption of DNA replication forks. Further, our in
vitro data demonstrate the accumulation of DNA-DSBs
was induced, as expected by etoposide, and maintained
in combination treatment. While there was no difference
between etoposide and combination induction of DNADSBs in vitro, our in vivo results showed that indeed
combination treatment significantly sustained increased
accumulation of DNA-DSBs over etoposide. Overall, we
believe sustained interference with DNA replication are
a major contributing factor to a greater cell catastrophe
leading to increased cell death following combination
treatment.
In summary, we demonstrate increased Top2a
mRNA expression in murine and human metastatic PCa.
Further, increased Top2a mRNA expression in primary
human PCa samples selects for patients with more
aggressive disease. We further describe a novel positive
correlation between Top2a and Ezh2 mRNA expression in
human PCa samples. Combination of etoposide with Ezh2
inhibition results in greater accumulation of DNA-DSB
and cell death, resulting in superior anti-tumor activity and
therapeutic efficacy with minimal acute toxicity in vivo.
Our results indicate this novel combination therapeutic
strategy is beneficial against aggressive PCa models
expressing ARv or neuroendocrine features, and provide
strong rationale for continued clinical development.

Prostate cancers (PCa) that progress due to gain of
androgen receptor splice variants (ARv) or neuroendocrine
features act independent of androgen signaling. No
therapies currently exist for these lethal PCa phenotypes.
Therefore, novel treatment strategies targeting nonandrogen related pathways that achieve sustainable
regression of disease and are urgently required.
We have recently reported the generation of a
syngeneic orthotopic transplant model of spontaneous
prostate cancer metastasis [15]. This model was generated
by the use of the murine Myc-CaP cell line [21]. Further,
it was shown the Myc-CaP cell line expresses ARv. MycCaP ARv was demonstrated to be structurally similar with
clinically relevant ARv, which function in the absence of
ligand [26]. Because of this, we feel that this unique model
currently represents an opportunity to discover new targets
which can be implemented into pre-clinical therapeutic
evaluation.
Our RNA-seq data highlighted increased expression
Topoisomerase IIα (Top2a) in murine metastatic tumors,
which was validated in a human PCa dataset [16]. Further,
our data was consistent with previous pre-clinical and
clinical data which associates increased Top2a mRNA
and protein expression with more rapid disease recurrence
and metastasis [6-8]. Interestingly, patients gene signature
based on high Top2a expression were distinct from
patients without alterations in Top2a levels. This highlights
a potential mechanistic insight underlying aggressive PCa
etiology.
Surprising to us, was the identification of a novel
positive correlation between increased mRNA levels of
Top2a and the histone methylatransferase, Ezh2. With
this, we pursued the attractive approach of combination
targeting of Top2 and Ezh2 inhibition. Top2 inhibitors/
poisons such as etoposide have been approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment
of multiple cancer cancers including PCa [4, 9, 11-14,
27].While studies have demonstrated the potential of
etoposide treatment for advanced PCa, they have yet to
deliver a combination strategy that provides significant
clinical benefit without associated toxicities. Also, Ezh2
is demonstrated to be deregulated in multiple cancers,
including PCa [28], and has been associated with PCa
progression and aggressiveness [29]. Recently, Ezh2
inhibition by compounds such as DZNep and GSK126 has
proven to display in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity
[20, 25, 30].
Combination treatment displayed strong efficacy
against our murine and human PCa models both in vitro
and in vivo, though combination appeared more potent
in our murine PCa models, with regards to cell cycle.
We believe the cell cycle responses may be enhanced in
Myc-CaP and TRAMP-C2 cells compared to LnCaP cells
because of more rapid doubling times of murine cell lines.

small RNA products (140-150bp). Successful constructs
are purified using a Pippen prep (Sage Inc.), using 125
– 160 bp product size settings with separation on a 3%
agarose gel. The purified samples are validated for size,
purity and concentration using a DNA-HS Bioanalyzer
chip. Validated libraries are pooled equal molar in a final
concentration of 10nM in Tris-HCI 10 mM, pH 8.5, before
50 cycle sequencing on a MiSeq (Illumina, Inc.).

RNA extraction

RNA-deep sequencing analysis

Freshly dissected primary and metastatic Myc-CaP/
AS and Myc-CaP/CR tumor samples were immediately
placed in TRIzol and homogenized (Branson Ultrasonics).
Standard TRIzol/chloroform RNA extraction was then
performed to isolate RNA.

All analysis was performed by the Department of
Bioinformatics and Statistics at Roswell Park Cancer
Institute. Reads were mapped to the latest mouse reference
genome (mm10) using Bowtie [34]. From the Bowtie
results, reads that matched a single unique location in the
genome were identified, allowing up to two mismatches.
The number of reads aligning to each gene was calculated.
Between-sample normalization was performed using
the Trimmed Mean of M-values normalization method
[35], which is specifically designed for RNA-seq data.
Differentially expressed genes were identified using
DESeq [36], a variance-analysis package developed
to infer the statically significant difference in RNA-seq
data. Multiple testing corrections were corrected. GEO
accession number, GSE64771, for RNA seq.
Gene Ontology (GO) David Analysis: GO
enrichment analysis was performed with DAVID
functional classification tool. The generated DEG file
for metastatic genes was uploaded to the web based
bioinformatics tool DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/
tools.jsp) [37]. Cutoff for genes of interest in the DEG file
was a p-value of <0.05.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis: The DEG genes for
the metastatic tumors were uploaded into the JAVA based
GSEA (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea) [38] tool and
the oncogenic signatures dataset were selected. Gene lists
from our RNA-seq as well as from the publically available
clinical dataset by Taylor et al [16] were uploaded and
analyzed.
In silico analysis of human prostate cancer data
sets: The human prostate cancer dataset was utilized
through the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics [18, 19].
Kaplan-Meier survival plot was generated by CBioPortal
and log rank statistical test applied. Gene signatures were
generated using Biobase [39] and Lima [40] for primary
tumors with increased Top2a expression (Top2a high)
and primary tumors samples without increased Top2a
expression (Top2a low). Supervised hierarchical clustering
and principle component analysis was performed using
the top 100 genes that were significantly changed between
either human primary prostate tumors with or without
increased Top2a expression (p<0.05, fold change >1.5)
using gplots [41]. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
for oncogenic signatures of human high Top2a expression
profile was performed using JAVA based GSEA tool [38].

RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing
One microgram (1µg) of total RNA from MycCaP tumor tissue was prepared for Illumina paired-end
sequencing using a Hi-Seq 2000 sequencer (Illumina).
Complete descriptions for library preparation methods and
sequencing data analysis are provided as supplementary
online material.
Following ribosomal RNA depletion and
fragmentation of total RNA (500ng), first strand cDNA is
generated using reverse transcription and random primers
using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation
kit (Illumina, Inc.), following manufacturer’s instructions.
Second strand cDNA synthesis is followed by end
modification and ligation of indexed sequencing adapters.
The products are PCR amplified for 15 cycles, purified and
validated for size (200-400bp) and quantitated using an
Agilent High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer Chip and the Agilent
2100 expert software. The individual cDNA libraries are
normalized to 10 nM and combined as equal molar aliquots
into pools of 2-6 samples. Each pool is normalized to
10pM, loaded and clustered to individual lanes of a HiSeq
Flow Cell using an Illumina cBot (TruSeq PE Cluster Kit
v3), followed by 2 x 101 PE sequencing on a HiSeq2000
sequencer according to the manufacturer’s recommended
protocol (Illumina Inc.). The sequencing libraries were
prepared with the TruSeq Small RNA kit (Illumina
Inc), from 1ug total RNA. Following manufacturer’s
instructions, the first step involves ligation of 5’ and 3’
RNA adapters to the mature miRNAs 5ʹ-phosphate and
3ʹ-hydroxyl groups, respectively. Following cDNA
synthesis, the cDNA is then amplified with 11-13 cycles
of PCR using a universal primer and a primer containing
one of 48 index sequences. The 48 different indexed tags
allow pooling of libraries and multiplex sequencing. Prior
to pooling, each individual sample’s amplified cDNA
construct is visualized on a DNA-HS Bioanalyzer DNA
chip (Agilent Technologies) for mature miRNA and other

Western Blot Analysis

Spearman correlation analysis was used to validate a
significant positive correlation between Top2a and Ezh2
mRNA expression in two independent human cohorts
(MSKCC [16] and TCGA [18, 19]).

Whole Cell Lysate Preparation (WCL): Cells were
harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer (Sigma Aldrich,
USA) + 1X P-STOP + 1X PIC (Roche) for 30 minutes
on ice. Eppendorf tubes were vortexed every ten minutes
for 10 seconds. After cell lysis tubes were centrifuged at
13,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant of each
tube was collected and transferred to a new tube.
Histone Extraction: Histone extractions were
performed using the Epigentek (EpiQuik Total Histone
extraction kit OP-0006) histone extraction kit.
Protein concentrations of whole cell lysates (WCL)
and histone extractions were measured by the bradford
protein assay (Bio-Rad laboratories). Protein lysates
(50μg WCL, 5μg Histone Extraction) where separation
using 4-15% by SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). The
proteins were transferred from the SDS-PAGE gel onto
nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 µm) (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA) via the semi-dry method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
for 35 minutes at 15V. Membranes were blocked in either
5% skim milk or BSA in 0.1% tween-PBS (tPBS) for
1-hour at RT. Membranes were washed briefly 3x with
tPBS prior to primary antibody incubation at 4°C over
night. Membranes were then washed 3x10 minutes before
the addition of secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) diluted
in tPBS. After incubation at RT for 1-hour with agitation
the membranes were washed 3x10 minutes in tPBS. The
immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence with ECL detection reagents (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences, UK). The blots were exposed
to Bio film for 1 second-10 minutes. The films were
then developed in a Kodak film developer. To estimate
molecular weight of bands a pre-stained protein ladder
was used (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Quantitative real-time PCR
Synthesis of cDNA was performed according to
iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, USA). 1μg of RNA was added to a master mix
containing nuclease free H2O, and reagents (5X iScript
reaction mix + iScript reverse transcriptase) from the kit
in a total volume of 20μl. cDNA was diluted 1:4 prior
to qRT-PCR. PCR primers were designed with NCBI’s
primer blast tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/
primer-blast/), with a melting temperature 57-63°C and a
resulting product size of 75-200bp. Primers were obtained
from Integrated DNA technologies (Coralville, USA).
Primer sequences were Top2a (F: AGG ATT CCG CAG
TTA CGT GG, R: CAT GTC TGC CGC CCT TAG AA),
and GAPDH (F: GTCTTCACCACCATGGAGAAG,
R: CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACCTTGG). Each PCR
reaction was carried out in technical triplicates in a
10μl volume utilizing SYBR Green Master Mix (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, USA). GAPDH was used a
control gene. The resulting Ct-values for each gene were
normalized to the expression values of GAPDH. The fold
change of metastatic tumor samples was then calculated
relative to that of primary tumor samples.

In vitro cell death assays
Cells were incubated in the presence of either in
single or combination dose of Etoposide and GSK126
for 24 or 48 hours respectively. Viability of cells was
measured by trypan blue exclusion assay. Cells were
mixed at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio with trypan blue (0.4% in PBS)
(Corning Cellgro). Cell death was then determined by
counting a total of 100-cells in a haemocytometer using
a light microscope.

In vivo animal studies
The Institute Animal Care and Use Committee
at Roswell Park Cancer Institute approved all mouse
protocols used in this study. One million (1x106) MycCaP/AS cells, or five million (5x106) TRAMP C2 cells
were subcutaneously injected into intact FVB and C57Bl/6 male mice respectively. Treatment was initiated when
tumor size reached ~40mm2, and mice were randomized
into four treatment groups: (1) Vehicle (5% DMSO/PBS,
2x week, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection), (2) Etoposide
(10mg/kg, d1-5, i.p.), (3) DZNep (2mg/kg, 2x week, i.p.),
(4) combination. Mice were weighed weekly to monitor
for toxicity and tumor growth was assessed by serial
caliper measurements twice weekly.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were seeded into 6-well plates (BD
Bioscience), left to adhere, and treated as indicated.
Following treatments, adherent and non-adherent cells
were collected and washed in 1x PBS, and fixed in
50% ethanol at 4ºC overnight. Cells were stained with
propidium iodide solution containing RNase A (Sigma) for
15 minutes at 37ºC. DNA content analysis was performed
by using a FACS caliber cytometer.

Mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation at defined
time points. Tumor was fixed in 10% buffered formalin
overnight followed by an additional 24 hours in 70%
ethanol. For antigen retrieval, slides (4µM) were boiled for
10 minutes in 10mM sodium citrate (pH 6) solution for all
antibodies. ImmPRESS detection sytem (Vector Labs) was
used for detection of all primary antibodies. Staining was
visualized using 3,3’-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Sigma).
Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Quantitation
of IHC staining representative images (4-6) was obtained
using a Zeiss light microscope (Zeiss). Staining intensity
was scored by Aperio ImageScope (v11.1.2.760).
