ABSTRACT
DNA topoisomerases play a key role in tumor proliferation. Chemotherapeutics
targeting topoisomerases have been widely used in clinical oncology, but resistance
and side effects, particularly cardiotoxicity, usually limit their application. Clinical data
show that a decrease in topoisomerase (top) levels is the primary factor responsible
for resistance, but in cells there is compensatory effect between the levels of top1
and top2a. Here, we validated cyclizing-berberine A35, which is a dual top inhibitor
and preferentially targets top2a. The impact on the top2a catalytic cycle indicated
that A35 could intercalate into DNA but did not interfere with DNA-top binding and
top2a ATPase activity. A35 could facilitate DNA-top2a cleavage complex formation by
enhancing pre-strand and post-strand cleavage and inhibiting religation, suggesting
this compound can be a topoisomerase poison and had a district mechanism from
other topoisomerase inhibitors. TARDIS and comet assays showed that A35 could
induce cell DNA breakage and DNA-top complexes but had no effect on the cardiac
toxicity inducer top2β. Silencing top1 augmented DNA break and silencing top2a
decreased DNA break. Further validation in H9c2 cardiac cells showed A35 did not
disturb cell proliferation and mitochondrial membrane potency. Additionally, an
assay with nude mice further demonstrated A35 did not damage the heart. Our work
identifies A35 as a novel skeleton compound dually inhibits topoisomerases, and
predominantly and specially targets top2a by interfering with all cleavage steps and
its no cardiac toxicity was verified by cardiac cells and mice heart. A35 could be a
novel and effective targeting topoisomerase agent.

of the DNA duplex, followed by the crossing of another
double strand of DNA through the transiently broken
duplex. Two top2 isozymes are expressed in humans:
top2α and top2β. Top2α is most abundantly expressed in
rapidly growing tissues, and its expression is cell cycleregulated, peaking during G2/M. In contrast, top2β is
ubiquitously expressed in terminally differentiated cells
including cardiomyocytes and its expression levels
do not  exhibit any significant changes during the cell
cycle [2–5].

INTRODUCTION
DNA topoisomerases are essential enzymes for
cells to modulate DNA topology by regulating the
over- or under-winding of DNA strands during cellular
processes such as DNA transcription, replication, or
recombination [1]. Top1 is a nuclear enzyme that catalyzes
the relaxation of superhelical DNA by generating a
transient single strand nick. Top2 mediates the ATPdependent induction of coordinated nicks in both strands

Given that they are highly expressed in aggressive
cancer cells and are essential to cancer cell survival, top1
and top2α are potential drug targets for treating human
malignancies. Compared with top1, top2α is more
essential for cell viability because only top2α can drive
the separation of two DNA duplexes after replication
and its deletion is lethal for cell survival [6–8].
Chemotherapeutics targeting top1 and in particular top2α
have been of great utility in clinical oncology. Although
these drugs are highly effective, tumors frequently
recur and even become resistant, and the occurrence of
side effects, particularly cardiotoxicity and secondary
malignancies, tremendously limit their application. Some
studies have shown that decreased topoisomerase levels
in relapsed tumors contribute to the tumor resistance
[9, 10]; additionally, researchers also found that there
is a compensatory effect between top1 and top2α: when
the expression of one type of topisomerase is decreased,
the other will be increased [9, 11–13]. Some evidence
regarding the adverse effects, particularly anthracyclineinduced cardiotoxicity mediated by targeting top2
indicated that non-specific targeting of top2β is the initial
molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon [14].
Thus, to overcome the above-mentioned drug resistance
and cardiotoxicity, combinatorial targeting of top1 and
top2α is essential, but recent clinical data have shown
that the combination of top1 and top2α poisons might
lead to severe life-threatening neutropenia and anemia
resulting from the toxicity overlay of the two agents
[13]. Thus, it is extremely important to identify a
compound that simultaneously targets top1 and top2α.
Although some researchers have investigated compounds
that could target top1 and top2, they did not precisely
elucidate whether the top2 target is top2α or top2β
[15–18]. Recently, one study in the literature reported an
agent that could inhibit top1 and top2α, but it did not
further clarify its effects on top2β [19]. Additionally, the
predicted lack of cardiac toxicity of reported inhibitors
specifically targeting top2α was obtained only based on
a cell-free assay (DNA directly incubated with synthetic
topoisomerase in buffer); further validation in cardiac
cells and drugs effects on animal cardiac muscle were
not reported [20–23].
Berberine (BBR, Figure 1A, left), an isoquinoline
natural product extracted from Coptis chinensis, has
been extensively used as an anti-inflammatory [24],
cholesterol-lowering [25] and antineoplastic [26] research
agent. However, its anticancer activity is weak [26, 27].
Cyclizing-berberine is a novel skeleton compound
(berberine of 1, 13-cyclication) that is occasionally
obtained during the structural transformation of berberine
in the search for a highly effective cholesterol-lowering
agent. A screen found that this class of compound could
inhibit cell proliferation; this detection evoked our interest
to determine whether this novel structural class compound
induced anticancer activity.

Via
successive
structural
transformation
(A series of new cyclizing-berberine derivatives were
synthesized through variations at the 9-position) and
repetitive cytotoxicity assays, cyclizing-berberine
A35 (replacement of 9-methoxyl with an ester moiety)
(Figure 1A, right) emerged and contained a greater
number of aromatic rings that facilitate intercalation
into DNA or topoisomerase, and also displayed excellent
anticancer activity that was clearly better than its parent
berberine (data not shown). A toxicity assay further
confirmed its lower toxicity (300 mg/kg administration
by intraperitoneal injection; the mouse survival rate
was 100%).
In the present study, we evaluated the novel
skeleton compound A35 in a cell-free assay, a cell assay
and in further animal experiments and demonstrated
that A35 could target top1 and particularly top2α by
increasing pre-strand and post-strand cleavage and
inhibiting the religation. Additionally, we also illustrated
that A35 could specifically target top2α and not top2β;
meanwhile, we confirmed that A35 did not induce cardiac
cell injury in rat cardiomyocyte cells and nude mouse
hearts.

RESULTS
A35 is a dual inhibitor of top2α and top1
Given that A35 possesses a greater number of
aromatic rings and its structure is similar to known
topoisomerase2 inhibitors [22, 23], we first examined
the effects of A35 on top2α activity by top2α-mediated
relaxation assay. As shown in Figure 1B, A35 significantly
inhibited top2α relaxation activity in a concentrationdependent manner. The relaxed DNA was quantified by
software Image J and IC50 (a concentration resulting in
50% relaxed DNA reduction) was calculated as 0.56 μM
by SigmaPlot. At the same concentration (10 μM),
inhibitory activity of A35 on top top2α was much higher
than that of etoposide (VP16), indicating that A35 was a
powerful top2α inhibitor. Then, we utilized top1-mediated
cleavage assay with linear DNA as substrate to evaluate
the effect of A35 on top1, and results showed that A35
could induce linear DNA breakage in dose-dependent
manner (Figure 1C), although the DNA breakage effect
was weak and far less than the positive control TPT
(topotecan), a water-soluble derivative of alkaloid
camptoth ecin (CPT) and could stabilize top1 cleavage
complexes [28, 29], indicating A35 could inhibit top1
activity. Similarly top1-mediated relaxation assay showed
that the IC50 of A35 on top1 was 22.1 μM that was far
higher than the IC50 of A35 on top2α (data not shown).
These results showed that A35 could dually inhibit top2α
and top1, although the effect on top2α was be superior to
the effect on top1.

backbone; this can then interfere with top2-DNA binding.
The ability of A35 to intercalate DNA was assessed using a
top1 unwinding assay as described [20], pBR322DNA was
firstly relaxed by top1 and mAMSA (amsacrine) (a known
DNA intercalator) as a positive control [30] or A35 was
added, then we observed the negative supercoiling formed
after the addition of mAMSA or A35 (Figure 2A). The
relaxed DNA was quantified, and the dose-response
curve and IC50 (a concentration of 50% relaxed DNA
reduction) showed almost identical DNA intercalation
activity between A35 and mAMSA, indicating that A35
was a DNA intercalator.
Given that A35 could intercalate into DNA, we
utilized an EMSA assay [31, 32] to measure whether

Given that top2α is indispensable for cell division
and was strongly inhibited by A35, in the following
experiment we focused on investigating the effects of A35
on top2α. There are several steps in the top2α catalytic
cycle. As a consequence, multiple independent approaches
are required to determine the mechanisms underlying
the drug-mediated inhibition of top2α. For A35, its
intercalation into DNA is attributed to its polar structure,
and this intercalation might lead to the topoisomerase
DNA binding site being occupied or distortion of the DNA

interestingly we found that at 6 μM A35 seemingly
promoted the binding of DNA and top2α slightly, and at
the highest concentration of 120 μM the binding activity
decreased compared with 6 μM.
The effect of A35 on top2α ATP enzyme activity was
examined by thin layer chromatography with [γ-32P]-ATP

and results showed that novobiocin (a known top2α ATP
enzyme inhibitor) [33] significantly suppressed top2αmediated ATP hydrolysis, demonstrating that the assay
was credible. But in A35-treated groups, we did not
observe significant changes of ATP hydrolysis mediated
by top2α, indicating that A35 did not inhibit top2α ATP
enzyme activity (Figure 2C).

Usually pre-strand cleavage and post-strand
cleavage participated in the top2α-mediated DNA cleavage
process [20]. Interference with any step would induce the
occurrence of DNA cleavage and linear DNA formation.
As ATP is required for strand passage, in the absence of
ATP top2 binds DNA and establishes prestrand cleavagereligation equilibrium prior to strand passage. As seen in

Figure 3B, a significant increase in the amount of cleaved
linear DNA was observed by addition of A35 (120 μM and
30 μM) and the cleaved band presented in a dose-dependent
manner, indicating that A35 enhanced pre-strand cleavage
reaction. Just in accordance with previous description

and strand passage steps, had no effects on the formation
of cleaved DNA or on the levels of nicked circular DNA in
the pre-cleavage stage as a negative control.
To determine if A35 has similar effects on
post-strand passage DNA cleavage, we repeated the
above experiment, but with the addition of Adenylylimidodiphosphate(AMPPNP) in the reaction buffer [34].
The addition of this non-hydrolyzable ATP analog permits
strand passage to occur. In the presence of AMPPNP and
Mg2+, incubated with increasing concentrations of A35
led to cleaved DNA increased (Figure 3C), and indicated
that A35 also prompted post-strand cleavage complex
formation.
We subsequently examined the effects of A35
on top2α-mediated DNA religation. We kinetically
trapped top2α-DNA complexes in the presence of Ca2+.
After using EDTA to chelate the excess Ca2+ ions,
Mg2+ reintroduction triggered the religation of the
linear band [20]. To examine whether A35 impacts the
religation of DNA by top2α, we initiated reactions with
Mg2+ in the presence or absence of A35 (Figure 3D).
The experiments demonstrated that the religation of
DNA occurred almost immediately and was severely
hindered by the addition of A35. Together, these results
indicated that A35 could enhance top2α-mediated prestrand and post-strand DNA cleavage and inhibit DNA
religation.

breakage at each concentration and in a dose-dependent
manner: at the lowest concentration of 1.2 μM, the tail
moment was approximately 9-fold of the control, and at
6 μM and 10 μM the tail moments were up to 30-fold
of the control, indicating that A35 induced more double
strand breakage (Figure 4B, lower).
The cell-free assays showed that A35 could
induce DNA-top1 or -top2α complex formation. We
then utilized the TARDIS (trapped in agarose-DNA
immunostaining) assay to further clarify the effects in
cells. As shown in Figure 4C, top1-DNA and top2αDNA complexes were observed in a dose-dependent
manner after treatment with A35, and at 6 μM the
top2α-positive cells were up to 80% and top1-positive
cells were approximately 20% of the total. However,
we did not visualize the top2β-DNA complex at any
concentration of A35. To further ascertain top2β is
not the target of A35, we performed top2β-mediated
DNA cleavage assay in the presence of A35 to evaluate
the effect of A35 on DNA cleavage, and results also
demonstrated that A35 did not lead to DNA breakage
mediated by top2β and the positive (VP16) control
induced significant DNA  breakage (Figure 4D),
indicating A35 did not target top2β.
To verify top1 and top2α are the primary target
of A35 to induce DNA breakage followed by cell
death, we knocked down top1, top2α and top2β and
further assessed whether A35-induced cell proliferation
inhibition and DNA breakage that was lethal to cell
survival could be reversed,. As shown in Figure 4E,
the topoisomerases were knocked down, and we found
there was a compensatory effect between top1 and
top2α, specifically that when top1 decreased top2α
would increase and vice-versa. However, in the top2βsilenced cells, there were only minor changes in top2α
and top1 levels. To these topoisomerase knockdown
cells, we added 2 μM A35 for 24 hours and evaluated
levels of the double-strand break (DSB) damage marker
γ-H2AX. The results showed that γ-H2AX levels
increased in top1 knockdown cells and decreased in
top2α knockdown cells, but obvious changes were not
detected in top2β knockdown cells (Figure 4E). Then,
we examined the effects of A35 on cell proliferation
after topoisomerase silencing, and the results showed
that with the knockdown of top1, the proliferation
inhibitory activity induced by A35 was strengthened but
was reversed after top2α was silenced, and there was no
significant change in top2β-silenced cells (Figure 4F).
The alkaline and neutral comet assays also showed that
in top1-silenced cells, single and double strand DNA
breakage all increased, while in top2α-silenced cells
single and double strand DNA breakage decreased
(Figure 4G). These results indicated that top1 and top2α
were all targets of A35, but top2α was a more vital target
and A35 did not target top2β.

Compared with top1, top2α is preferentially and
specifically targeted in A35-induced cell DNA
strand breaks, top-DNA covalent complexes and
growth inhibition
Although the cell-free assay showed that A35
was a dual inhibitor against top1 and top2α, true target
identification should be obtained in a cell assay. First,
we used K562, HL60, Raji and Romas hematological
tumor cells as well as solid tumor cells including the
hepatic carcinoma cell lines HepG2, Bel7402 and
Bel7404 and colorectal cancer cell lines to evaluate the
growth inhibitory effects of A35. The results showed
that the IC50 for all cancer cells except for Bel7404 was
less than 2 μM, indicating good proliferation inhibitory
activity (Figure 4A). Given that the cell-free assay
showed that A35 induce top1 and top2α mediated DNA
single or double DNA cleavage, we examined DNA
single strand breakage with an alkaline comet assay [35]
and double strand breakage with a neutral comet assay
in cells treated with A35. The results showed that A35
could induce single strand DNA breakage, and at 1.2 μM
the tail moment (TM) was about 1.5 folds of control,
and at higher concentrations (6 μM and 10 μM) the
tail moments were approximately 3-fold of the control
(Figure 4B, upper). Neutral comet electrophoresis
indicated that A35 could induce obvious DNA double

tumor therapy. However, given their adverse effects,
the application of topoisomerase 2 inhibitors, especially
anthracyclines such as doxorubicin (DOX), has been
restricted primarily due to the serious cardiac toxicity that
results from targeting top2β. Although the above cell-free
and cell-based assays verified that A35 could not target
top2β, for further verifying the non-cardiotoxic effects

of A35 we utilized H9C2 cardiac myoblasts from rats to
perform the following assays. First, we evaluated whether
A35 exerted proliferation inhibitory effects on H9C2
cells, and the results showed that after 24 h treatment
with A35, at the concentrations of 2 μM and 5 μM cell
vitality was almost equal to the control, and at 10 μM
cell survival was approximately 90% of the control. After
treatment for 48 h, H9C2 cell survival was approximately
90% of the control at 2 μM and 5 μM and 80% at 10 μM
(Figure 5A), indicating that A35 barely interfered with
cardiac cell proliferation. However, in the doxorubicintreated group, we visualized obvious cardiac cell growth
inhibitory effects after 24 h of treatment, and at 48 h, most
cells were dead at higher concentrations. Specifically, after
24 h treatment cell survival was 70.2% of the control at
2 μM, 63.5% at 5 μM and 53.2% at 10 μM, and after 48 h
treatment cell survival was 40.3% at 2 μM, 12.5% at 5 μM
and 7.3% at 10 μM. Similarly, after the addition of DOX
for 48 h, obvious apoptosis occurred, and the apoptotic
cells were approximately 45% at 2 μM, 78% at 5 μM and
85% at 10 μM, but there was only 7–12% apoptotic cells
observed in the A35-treated group (Figure 5B).
A number of studies have suggested that
mitochondrial dysfunction is the primary molecular
mechanism underlying DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
Alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential were the
main effects of DOX in the mitochondria. Recent studies
showed that DOX-induced mitochondria dysfunction
is entirely attributable to the targeting of mitochondria
top2β, leading to mitochondrial nucleic acid synthesis
blockage and causing the collapse of membrane potential,
finally leading to whole-cell energy supply obstruction
and cell death [14, 36]. We detected the effects of A35
on mitochondrial membrane potential with JC-1. JC-1
is a fluorescent dye that exhibits potential-dependent
accumulation in the mitochondria and can selectively
enter the mitochondria as J-aggregates (JC-1 aggregates)
with intense red-orange fluorescence in normal cells. If
the membrane potential is disturbed, the dye remains in
the monomeric form as J-monomer, emitting only green
fluorescence. In our experiments, shown in Figure 5C, red
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

granular aggregates were observed in the cytoplasm after
excitation at 488 nm, both in untreated H9C2 cells or cells
treated with various concentrations of A35, indicating that
A35 did not alter the mitochondrial membrane potential
of H9C2 cells. However, in doxorubicin-treated cells,
at 2 μM red granular aggregates obviously decreased in
the cytoplasm, and at higher concentrations (5 μM and
10 μM), red fluorescence aggregates almost entirely
disappeared, indicating that cell mitochondria membrane
potency was dramatically destroyed. Given that top2 was
mainly located in the nucleus and doxorubicin itself emits
red fluorescence, we observed red fluorescence in cells,
particularly in the nuclei. Meanwhile, in the doxorubicintreated group, we observed cytoplasm that was distinctly
wrinkled, distorted and broken. In comparison, the
cytoplasm in A35-treated H9C2 cells was plump both at
low or high concentrations, indicating that A35 did not
injure cardiac cells and their mitochondria.
Then, we examined the signal proteins
associated with mitochondrial damage that lead to cell
apoptosis. It was previously reported that activated p53
(phosphorylated at Ser 15) and p53 levels were important
to induce cardiomyocyte mitochondrial damage and finally
cell death [37], and p53 levels are usually dependent on
the activation of MAPK family proteins such as p-38,
ERK and JNK. In our experiment, the phosphorylation
levels of p-38, ERK and JNK and p53 in H9C2 cells did
not significantly change following the addition of A35,
despite the fact that these protein levels were obviously
elevated in the doxorubicin-treated group. The levels of
downstream targeting protein of p53 such as Bcl-2 did not
change in A35-treated cells (Figure 5D).
Annexin V-PI was used to evaluate the apoptosis or
necrosis of tumor cells treated with A35, and the results
indicated that the apoptotic cells were approximately 90%
of total apoptotic and necrotic cells and increased in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 5E). We also observed
the final apoptosis event in which PARP was cleaved after
A35 treatment for 24 or 48 hours either in K562 or HepG2
cells (Figure 5F). Cleaved and activated caspase-7 that
could cleave PARP was also detected after A35 addition.

whose activation represents mitochondrial apoptosis.
The expression levels of the proteins that promote
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway activation, such as Bax
and p53 (although p53 is a mutant in K562 cells), were
not increased in the presence of A35, and the expression
of Bcl-2, a protein that suppresses mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway activation, did not change (Figure 5F).

mouse myocardium. The results indicated that A35 could
suppress tumor xenograft proliferation, and at 20 mg/kg the
inhibitory rate was approximately 55%, while at 10 mg/kg
the inhibitory rate was approximately 35% (Figure 6A). The
body weight curves indicated that the animals tolerated well
the A35 dosages administered (Figure 6B). When the tumor
sizes reached 1000 mm3, the mice were sacrificed, and tumors
and hearts were excised to be used for further analysis.
Tumor tissue was prepared as frozen sections for γ-H2AX
detection and for a TUNEL assay to detect apoptosis. The
results showed that A35 could significantly induce DNA
double breakage, and γ-H2AX-positive cells increased to
40%, and the TUNEL results indicated that A35 could induce
tumor cell apoptosis and the apoptotic cells comprised up to
approximately 70% of total cells (Figure 6C), indicating an
identical action mechanism as for the in vitro results.

examined A35 anticancer efficacy and its effects on the

is similar to known top2α inhibitor NK314 [22, 23].
After evaluating its effects on top1 and top2α activity,
unexpectedly we found that not only could A35 inhibit
top2α but it had an effect on top1, indicating that it is a
dual topoisomerase inhibitor and has distinct effects on
topoisomerases from NK314. Previously, some studies
demonstrated that decreased topoisomerase levels are
a major mechanism underlying relapse [9] and verified
the compensatory effects between top1 and top2, which
were also verified in the present study. Additionally, some
authors also proposed that a dual targeting topoisomerase
might increase overall anti-tumor activity, given that
top1 and top2 have overlapping functions in DNA
metabolism [41]. Thus, the novel skeleton compound A35
as a dual targeting top1 and top2α inhibitor might have the
potency to avoid resistance and produce more powerful
anticancer activity.
Given top2α is a more effective target based on
its preferential expression in proliferating cells and as
the sole enzyme to distort daughter chromosomes, and
the stronger effects of A35 on top2α; we focused on
studying the inhibitory effects of A35 on top2α. Top2

DISCUSSION
Cyclizing-berberine A35 is a site 1 and 13 cyclizing
berberine. The cyclizing endows this compound with
more planar structures that induce intercalation into free
DNA, and these aromatic rings enhance the potency of
intercalation into topoisomerase [38–40]. This structure

manipulates DNA topology in an ATP-dependent manner
via the mechanism known as the “catalytic cycle”. The
interruption of any step in the catalytic process might
obstruct enzyme activity. Our results showed that although
A35 could intercalate into DNA, it did not disrupt the
top2α-DNA interaction. The ATP hydrolysis assay also
demonstrated that A35 did not block top2α ATPase
activity. Cleavage assays demonstrated that A35 could
stabilize the intermediate DNA-top2α complex by exerting
its actions both in pre-strand and post-strand cleavage
steps and inhibiting religation. Considering all the results
above mentioned, Its mechanism is distinct from other
known top2α inhibitors, such as etoposide, which only has
a very low affinity for intact DNA and only inserts into
DNA cleavage sites and inhibits DNA religation [42, 43],
and doxorubicin, which at low concentrations (<1 μM)
only inhibits DNA religation and at higher concentrations
(>10 μM) it interferes with top2 binding to DNA to exert
anticancer effects [44]. Other reported inhibitors, such as
the quinolone CP-115, the ellipticines, azatoxins, and the
natural flavonoid genistein, either strengthen pre-strand
or post-strand cleavage to facilitate top-DNA complex
formation [45].
The A35 parental core berberine was reported to
inhibit top1 [46] and in our lab we did not observe any
inhibitory effects on top1 or top2α at concentration up to 80
μM (data not shown), a concentration at which A35 could
obviously suppress top1 and top2α activity, indicated a
higher topoisomerase inhibitory activity than berberine.
Although some studies showed that berberine structural
analog 5,6-dihydrocoralyne possessed inhibitory activity
against top1 and top2, they did not clarify the effect on top2
isoforms [47, 48]. Berberine and its structural analog trigger
mitochondria-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells, and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studies also found that mitochondria membrane potential
was severely destroyed [27, 49]; meanwhile, p53 was
activated, levels of Bax, which can trigger mitochondrial
caspase activation, increased and inhibitory protein Bcl2
levels decreased [27, 50, 51]. However, in A35-treated
cancer cells, although apoptosis appeared, the mitochondria
apoptosis pathway was not activated, which indicated the
distinct mechanism from its parental core berberine in
apoptosis induction. Usually except mitochondria caspase9,
some non-mitochondrial caspases such as caspase-2,
caspase-8 and caspase10 also play key role in activating
effector caspase-7 [52], thus we speculate A35-induced
caspase-7 activation and subsequent apoptosis might be
a result of activation of non-mitochondrial caspases. This
also arouses our interest and in the following study we will
continue working on this issue.
Human top2α and top2β share very similar catalytic
activities and are highly conserved, with 78% amino acid
identity [53]; many agents targeting top2α also interfere
with top2β, such as doxorubicin. However, as the sole
enzyme present in heart tissue, the targeting of top2β
would disrupt the normal catalytic cycle of top2β and then
cause DNA DSB formation and mitochondria destruction,
and damage to these organelles would activate the
mitochondria apoptosis pathway mediated by p53, which
underlies so-called cardiac toxicity [14]. Some reports
have also demonstrated that embryonic fibroblasts lacking
top2β were better protected against doxorubicin-induced
cytotoxicity [54], and top2β deletion mice better prevented
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy [5]. Another
advantage of only targeting top2α and not targeting top2β
is the potential to avoid secondary malignancies. Top2β
has been suggested as a major culprit in the development
of secondary malignancies [55]. Currently, many novel
18

compounds have also been demonstrated to specifically
target top2α, but these data were only from cell-free assays,
i.e., compound, extracted topoisomerase enzyme and DNA
plasmid directly reacted in buffer. However, validation
with cardiomyocytes and animal hearts has not been
reported. In our study, not only did we confirm the target in
a cell-free assay but also using rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes
and nude mice, and we demonstrated that A35 did not
induce DNA breakage, mitochondrial injury, apoptosis
and p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway
activation in cardiac cells, which are the main cellular
alterations following the targeting of top2β, although in the
DOX-treated group the above-mentioned effects were all
observed, which further indicated that there were no effects
of A35 on top2β at the cellular and animal levels.
In summary, as a novel and DNA intercalative agent,
A35 dually inhibits topoisomerase and preferentially and
specially targets top2α. It acts as a poison to promote
DNA-top complex formation and had no effect on other
catalytic steps mediated by top2α. Its distinct mechanisms
from other known poisons will be useful for its
combination with other topisomerase inhibitors. Although
A35 intensively induced cancer cell apoptosis, it did not
trigger the apoptosis of cardiac cells and mouse hearts and
did not damage the mitochondria either in cancer cells or
cardiac cells. Its further exploration might be helpful to
overcome top1 and top2 resistant and cardiac toxicity, A35
is a promising topoisomerase anticancer agent and worthy
to further develop in future.

Topoisomerase-mediated DNA relaxation assay
The DNA relaxation assay was based on a procedure
described previously [56]. Briefly, 2 μl of 10x reaction
buffer with 1 mM ATP (top2α) or without ATP (top1),
0.5 μg of supercoiled pBR322, and 1 unit of top2α
(Topogen) or top1 and compound were mixed in a total
of 20 μl of reaction buffer. Relaxation was performed at
37°C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 2.5 μl of
stop solution (100 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 50% glycerol,
0.05% bromophenol blue). Electrophoresis was performed
in a 1% agarose gel in 0.5x TBE at 4 V/cm for 1.5 hr.
DNA bands were stained with the nucleic acid dye EB
and photographed with 300 nm UV transillumination.
The DNA bands were qualified with software Image J.
The percent of relaxed DNA was calculated as: (R-R0)/
(Rcontrol-R0), where R is the intensity of relaxed DNA
incubated with top2α and compound, R0 is the intensity
of relaxed DNA of pBR322 and Rcontrol is the intensity
of relaxed DNA incubated with top1. The IC50 was
defined as the concentration of A35 that resulted in a 50%
reduction of relaxed DNA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Top1-mediated DNA cleavage

Reagents and cells

DNA cleavage assays were performed as described
previously [57–59] A 117-bp DNA oligonucleotide from
Sangon Biotech encompassing the previously identified
top1 cleavage sites identified in the 161-bp fragment
from pBluescript SK(−) phagemid DNA was employed.
This 117-bp oligonucleotide contains a single 5′-cytosine
overhang, which was 3′-end labeled by fill-in reaction
with [α-32P]-dGTP in reaction 2 buffer (50 mMTris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 100 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl) with 0.5 units
of DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment, New England
BioLabs). Unincorporated 32P-dGTP was removed
using mini Quick Spin DNA columns (Roche), and the
eluate containing the 3′-end-labeled DNA substrate was
collected. Approximately 3 nM of radiolabeled DNA
substrate was incubated with recombinant top1 (60U)
in 20 μl of reaction buffer [10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5),
50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 15 μg/ml
BSA] at 25°C for 30 min in the presence of various drug
concentrations. The reactions were terminated by adding
SDS (0.5% final concentration) followed by the addition
of two volumes of loading dye (80% formamide, 10 mM
sodium hydroxide, 1 mM sodium EDTA, 0.25% xylene
cyanol, and 0.25% bromophenol blue). Aliquots of each

impregnated cellulose plates (Sigma-Aldrich) and airdried. Reaction mixtures were resolved by developing
plates with freshly prepared NH4HCO3 (0.4 M). Plates
were air-dried and exposed to autoradiographic film. Spots
corresponding to free phosphate were excised from the
thin layer chromatography plates and quantified using a
scintillation counter.

Topoisomerase 1-mediated DNA
unwinding assay
To examine the effects of A35 on DNA intercalation,
a top1-based assay was carried out according to the
literature [20]. In brief, supercoiled plasmid pBR322 was
firstly relaxed with recombinant human top1 (4 units)
at 37°C for 30 min. Subsequently, A35 or mAMSA was
added to the reaction and incubated for a further 30 min
at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS
to a final concentration of 1% w/v, and top1 was digested
by the addition of proteinase K (50 μg) and incubation for
1 h at 56°C. Samples were resolved on a 1% w/v agarose
gel in 0.5x TBE at 4 V/cm for 2 hr and stained with EB.
The definition of the percent of relaxed DNA and IC50
was as described in the “Topoisomerase-mediated DNA
relaxation assay” section in the Methods.

Top2-mediated DNA cleavage
DNA cleavage assay was performed by using a
Top2α Drug Screening Kit (Topogen), 0.2 μg pBR322
DNA plasmid was incubated with top2α or top2β which
was obtained and purified as described previously [62] in
20 μl of assay buffer at 37°C for 30 min in the presence
or absence of A35 or etoposide. DNA cleavage products
were trapped by the addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS and
1.5 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K, and then incubation
continued for 60 min at 56°C to digest top2α. The samples
were mixed with 2.5 μl of loading buffer and subjected
to electrophoresis in 1.4% agarose containing 0.5 mg/ml
EB at 12 V for 15 hr. All DNA forms were separated and
migrated as follows: RLX, SC, LNR, and NC.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
The effect of A35 on the binding of top2α to DNA
was evaluated using an electrophoretic mobility shift
(EMSA) kit (Invitrogen) as previously described [60]
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Oligonucleotides
containing a strong top2 binding site corresponding to
residues 87–126 of the pBR322 plasmid were annealed,
and 1 nm was incubated with nuclear extracts (5 μg) from
K562 cells in reaction buffer (750 mM KCl, 0.5 mM
dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4) on ice
for 30 min. Then, the samples were electrophoresed on a
5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 100 V and 4°C
in TBE buffer for 1.5 h. DNA was stained with SYBR
Green and detected by 300 nm UV transillumination.
In A35-treated samples, A35 and nuclear extracts were
first incubated for 10 min on ice prior to the addition of
oligonucleotide probes, and incubation continued for
30 min on ice. In super shift experiments, an antibody
against top2 was first incubated with nuclear extracts
for 1 h on ice, and then 1 nm probes were added and
incubation continued for 30 min on ice.

ATP-independent pre-strand passage
cleavage assay
Top2α-mediated plasmid DNA cleavage in the absence
of nucleotide triphosphate was performed as described with
slight modifications [56, 63]. Top2α (8 μnits) was incubated
with 0.2 μg of pBR322 with increasing concentrations of
A35 or ICRF-193 in 20 μl of reaction buffer. The final buffer
contained 0.01 M Tris pH 7.7, 0.05 M NaCl, 0.05 M KCl,
0.1 mM EDTA, 0.005 M MgCl2 and 0.03 μg/μl bovine
serum albumin. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37°C
and terminated by addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS, followed by
addition of 1.5 μl of 0.25M EDTA and continued to culture
for 5 min at 37°C. Then, reactions were digested with 8 μg
of proteinase K and incubated for 60 min at 56°C. DNA
products were separated on a 1.4% gel containing 0.7 μg/μl
ethidium bromide.

Post-strand passage cleavage assay
A top2α-mediated post-strand passage cleavage
assay was performed as described above for pre-strand
passage cleavage with the exception that 1 mM AMPPNP
(Sigma) was added in the reactions [63].

ATPase assay
ATPase activity of top2α was examined by
measuring the liberated phosphate of [γ-32P]-ATP by thin
layer chromatography as previously described [20, 61].
Briefly, top2α (8 units) was incubated in reaction buffer
A (Topogen) in the presence of 1.2 μg pBluescript-KS(+)
plasmid DNA and the indicated drug for 10 min at room
temperature prior to initiating the reaction with the addition
of 3 μCi of [γ-32P]-ATP (PerkinElmer; 3000 Ci/mmol)
and continued to incubate at 37°C. Aliquots (2 μl) were
withdrawn at various time points (0, 5 min, 10 min. 15 min,
20 min) and loaded onto pre-washed polyethyleneiminewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ATP-independent DNA religation assay
Top2α-mediated religation of DNA in the absence of
ATP was performed as described previously [20]. Top2α
(8 units) was incubated with 0.2 μg of pBR322 plasmid
DNA in a reaction buffer containing 0.01 M Tris pH 7.7,
0.05 M NaCl, 0.05 M KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.005 M CaCl2
and 0.03 μg/μl of bovine serum albumin for 10  min at

37°C. Immediately after, various concentrations A35 or
control were added, followed by the addition of 2 μl of
0.1 M EDTA to the reactions. Then, the reactions were
re-initiated by the addition of 0.1 M MgCl2 (2 μl) and
transferred immediately onto ice. At the indicated time
points (15, 30 or 60 seconds), reactions were terminated
by the addition of 1% w/v SDS and incubation continued
at 37°C for 5 min. The reactions were then incubated with
proteinase K (8 μg) for 30 min at 56°C. DNA products
were separated on an agarose gel (1.4% w/v) containing
ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/μl).

Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated
Gene knockdown

Comet assay

Western blot

Top1- or Top2-mediated DNA breakage was
measured with a neutral comet assay (Trevigen) for DSB
detection or an alkaline comet assay for single-strand
break detection as described in the manufacturer’s
procedures and the literature [64]. The treated cells were
embedded in agarose on a slide and subjected to lysis
followed by electrophoresis under neutral or alkaline
conditions. During electrophoresis, the damaged and
fragmented negatively charged DNA migrated away
from the nucleus toward the anode. The amount of
migrated DNA was a measure of the extent of DNA
damage. To detect DNA, the slides were stained with
SYBR Gold (Life Technology) staining solution. The
slides were examined by fluorescence microscopy
(Olympus), and the results were analyzed with the comet
analysis software CASP to quantify DNA damage.
For each drug concentration, 3 independent assays
were conducted in which comet tails were analyzed
in a minimum of 50 randomly selected cells in each
assay, and parameter reflecting the DNA damage was
represented as TM (tail moments, percentage of DNA in
tail/tail length) [65].

Whole-cell lysates were used for immunoblotting as
described previously [67].

TARDIS assay

The in vivo efficacy of A35 was evaluated with
HepG2 xenografts in nude mouse (purchased from
Experimental Animals, Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences & Peking Union Medical College). First,
1 × 107 HepG2 cells suspended in 200 μl of PBS were
inoculated s.c. in the right armpits of nude mice. After 3
weeks, the tumors were removed from the nude mice and
dissected aseptically in sterile saline. Pieces of tumor
tissue (2 mm3 in size) were then transplanted into the
right armpits of nude mice with a trocar. Tumor-bearing
mice were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 5)
when the tumor size was about 100 mm3. A35 (10 or
20 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection
once a day until the mice were sacrificed. Tumor size
was measured every 3 days, and tumor volume was
determined as length × width2/2. Mice were killed
when the tumor volumes of the control group reached
1000 mm3; the tumor loads and hearts were isolated and
used in further assays.

Topoisomerase knockdown experiments were
carried out in the same manner as described previously
[66]. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized
by Ribo Technology Company using 2′-ACE protection
chemistry. The sequences targeting top1, 2α and 2β were,
respectively, 5′ GGACUCCAUCAGAUACUAUTT
3′, 5′GGUAUUCCUGUUGUUGAAC 3 ’and 5′
AGCCCGAUCCUUUCUUCAUUU 3′.

Measurement of mitochondrial membrane
potential
5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazo­
locar bocyanine iodide (JC-1) dye (sigma) exhibits
­potential-dependent accumulation in the mitochondria,
and JC-1 selectively enters the mitochondria and spontaneously forms complexes known as J-aggregates. If the
membrane potential is disturbed, the dye remains in the
monomeric form, emitting only green fluorescence. Thus,
this dye was employed to detect changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). JC-1 dye was added to
the culture medium at 10 μg/ml and incubated for 15 min
at 37°C. After mounting on the slides, the cells were
­immediately examined under a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus).

In vivo antitumor activity

The TARDIS assay is used to determine cleavable
complex formation and has been described in detail [35].
Briefly, cells treated with various concentrations of A35
for 1.5 hr were embedded in agarose on microscope
slides and subjected to a lysis procedure that removed
the cell membrane and soluble proteins in lysis buffer
(1% sarkosyl; 80 mM phosphate, pH6.8; 10 mM EDTA
plus protease inhibitors). To remove noncovalently
bound nuclear proteins, cells were washed with 1 M
NaCl plus protease inhibitors. Then, slides were
stained with primary antibody (specific for top1, top2α
or top2β, with a dilution of 1:200) and a fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated secondary antibody.
Finally, the slides were mounted with an anti-quenching
agent containing DAPI. Images were captured using a
fluorescence microscope that separately visualizes green
(FITC-stained) and blue (DAPI-stained) fluorescence.
