Abstract
Age is a major risk factor for the development of cancer. Senescent ﬁbroblasts, which accumulate with age,
secrete protumorigenic factors collectively referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP). Here, we examined the molecular mechanisms that control SASP activation, focusing on the known
SASP factor osteopontin (OPN). We found that expression of the canonical SASP members interleukin (IL)-6
and IL-8, but not OPN, were dependent upon a persistent DNA damage response (DDR) as evidenced by ATM
and NF-kB activation. Treatment with several histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors robustly activated SASP
in the absence of DNA breaks, suggesting that DDR-dependent SASP activation occurs in response to
chromatin remodeling rather than physical breaks in DNA. In the setting of HDAC inhibition, IL-6 and IL-8
expression remained dependent upon ATM and NF-kB, while OPN expression remained independent of these
factors. Further analysis revealed that HDAC1 inhibition was sufﬁcient to induce OPN expression, which is
interesting given that loss of HDAC1 expression correlates with increased OPN expression within the stromal
compartment of invasive breast cancers. Importantly, ﬁbroblasts treated with HDAC inhibitors promoted
tumor growth in vivo. Our ﬁndings therefore indicate that HDAC modulation plays an important role in
stromal cell activation, with important implications for the use of HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of cancer.

Introduction
Senescence within incipient tumor cells is a potent tumor
suppressive mechanism. Cells undergoing senescence are
characterized by a permanent cell-cycle arrest, ﬂattened cellular morphology, increased senescence-associated b-galactosidase (SA-bgal) activity, and in many instances the appearance of facultative heterochromatin domains known as
senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF; ref. 1).
Numerous oncogenic stimuli including activation of cellular
oncogenes, persistent DNA damage, and continued cellular
proliferation activate senescence (1). Yet the impact of senescence is context dependent. Thus, when activated in an incipient tumor cell, senescence is a potent tumor suppressor that
must be bypassed if cells are to complete the transformation
process (2). However, when senescence occurs within surAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Cell Biology and Physiology; 2Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology; 3Department of Medicine; and 4BRIGHT

rounding stromal cells, those cells function as potent tumor
promoters (3, 4).
Extensive microarray analyses have revealed that senescent
cells activate a conserved program that is characterized by
increased expression of numerous factors including inﬂammatory cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix
(ECM) remodeling enzymes that are highly reminiscent of
factors expressed in cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (CAF). This
expression proﬁle is collectively referred to as the senescenceassociated secretory phenotype (SASP; ref. 5). Many SASP
factors not only enforce the cell-cycle arrest that characterizes
senescence within the originating cell but they also impact the
surrounding milieu. For example, secreted mitogens stimulate
premalignant epithelial cell growth in vitro and in xenograft
models (3, 4), ECM remodeling enzymes such as matrix
metalloproteinases affect branching and migration (6), and
other factors including cytokines promote invasion (7, 8). The
ability of senescent ﬁbroblasts to inﬂuence tumorigenesis has
been documented in multiple systems; however, until recently,
the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating SASP activation were unknown.
In human cells, both the p53 and Rb pathways function
redundantly to activate cellular senescence (9, 10). Abrogation
of either pathway is insufﬁcient to bypass senescence following
a senescence-inducing stimulus. However, when both the p53
and Rb pathways are inactivated, cells bypass both telomeredriven replicative senescence and stress-induced premature

senescence, which can be induced by a wide range of cellular
stresses. Given the importance of the senescence effector
proteins in the activation of senescence, it was hypothesized
that their inhibition would result in loss of SASP activation.
Surprisingly, when a senescence-inducing dose of DNA damage
is delivered to p53/Rb-deﬁcient human cells, these cells continue to divide, yet still activate SASP factors interleukin (IL)-6
and IL-8 (7). Furthermore, when p53 and Rb are abrogated in
already senescent, SASP-expressing cells, SASP expression
remains (5), indicating that p53/Rb are not required to maintain SASP expression in senescent cells. Together these data
indicate that senescent cells robustly express SASP but that the
induction of senescence per se is not required to activate or
maintain SASP expression.
Investigation into the cellular signaling pathways that activate the SASP indicates that a persistent DNA damage
response (DDR) is sufﬁcient to activate some SASP factors.
Indeed, signaling downstream of ATM (including NBS1 and
Chk2) controls a subset of SASP factors, including IL-6 and IL-8
(7). The mechanisms linking DDR to SASP activation remain
unclear but DDR induces chromatin alterations that can
impact numerous transcription pathways. Therefore, transcriptional changes that occur in senescent cells may result
from speciﬁc chromatin modulations. Mounting evidence
implicates chromatin remodeling in the establishment of the
senescent state. In senescent cells, heterochromatic regions
referred to as SAHFs form at E2F promoters and functionally
repress cellular proliferation (11). In replicative senescence,
histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity diminishes (12) corresponding with an increase in histone acetylation. In addition,
a decline in global DNA methylation has been reported in
senescent cells [(13) and references therein]. Interestingly,
treatment with HDAC inhibitors including sodium butyrate
(NaB) or trichostatin A (TSA) induces senescence in some cell
types, further supporting the hypothesis that chromatin relaxation plays a causative role in senescence (12, 14).
A role for transcriptional control in the regulation of SASP
factors has also been suggested by recent work, particularly for
a number of inﬂammatory factors including IL-6, IL-8, and
CXCR2. Transcriptional regulation of such cytokines in other
biological settings by NF-kB and CEBPb applies to senescence
as well. In fact, these transcription factors occupy the promoters of several cytokines in senescent cells (15, 16). However, it
is unknown how these factors are activated in response to
senescence-inducing stimuli and subsequently direct transcriptional changes in senescence.
Osteopontin (OPN), also known as secreted phosphoprotein
1, is a multifunctional signaling molecule (17). Originally
identiﬁed in cancer cells (18), the physiologic function of OPN
is linked to matrix integrity and bone maintenance (19). Since
its initial identiﬁcation, OPN has been implicated in every stage
of tumorigenesis and is a prognostic factor for several malignancies (20). We previously reported that OPN levels increase
in senescent cells and showed that it is a critical mediator of
stromal–epithelial interactions in tumorigenesis (4). In addition, OPN expression in the stromal compartment of human
skin coincides with senescent markers, raising the possibility
that it plays an important role in the early stages of tumor-

igenesis (21). Despite the importance of senescence-derived
OPN, its regulation in senescent cells remains unknown. Here,
we report that following senescence-inducing stimuli, OPN
upregulation occurs independent of the senescence effector
pathways p53 and Rb, similar to what has been shown for other
SASP members including IL-6 and IL-8 (5). This ﬁnding shows
that senescence induction is not a prerequisite for SASP
activation following exposure to chronic cellular stress, including treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Further investigation revealed that contrary to the signature SASP members,
IL-6 and IL-8, OPN expression is insensitive to NF-kB and ATM
signaling. Thus, our results indicate that the SASP is controlled
by at least 2 independent transcription programs. Importantly,
agents capable of directly perturbing chromatin structure
without inducing DNA breaks were potent inducers of SASP,
including OPN expression. Speciﬁcally, ectopic expression of a
dominant negative form of HDAC1 leads to OPN mRNA
upregulation. Furthermore, treatment of ﬁbroblasts with
HDAC inhibitors led to a signiﬁcant paracrine stimulation of
tumor growth, which suggests that these inhibitors may
adversely impact the stromal compartment in the therapeutic
setting.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and treatments
Human foreskin BJ ﬁbroblasts and 293T cells were grown
as previously described (4). These cell lines were originally
obtained from Dr. Robert Weinberg's laboratory and were not
recently reauthenticated. Human AT ﬁbroblasts (GM09607)
were purchased from Coriell Institute, used within 6 months of
receipt and grown in minimum essential medium media
supplemented with 15% nonheat inactivated FBS (Sigma).
WI38 fetal lung ﬁbroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS (Sigma) and transduced with telomerase (pBabe vector
with hygromycin selection) and human papilloma virus 16
proteins E6 and E7 [expressed from the LXSN vector (22)].
Fibroblasts were mock- or bleomycin sulfate-treated (100
mg/mL; Sigma) for 24 hours. After 72-hour serum starvation,
RNA was collected with TRI Reagent (Ambion/Applied
Biosystems). Cells were incubated with 2 fresh changes of
4 mmol/L sodium butyrate (Sigma) for 72 or 144 hours,
6 mmol/L MS-275 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for 6 days, 3
mmol/L of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), or vorinostat (Selleck) for 6 days, or 1 mmol/L TSA (Sigma) for
3 days.
Plasmids
The IkBa mutant (IkBa-mut) in a pBabe construct (23) was
purchased from Addgene (plasmid 15291). The NF-kB promoter luciferase construct, pkB5-Fluc (Stratagene) and pRLCMV (Promega) were used in transient transfections. Two
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting the human
ATM gene (shATM-1:CCTTTCATTCAGCCTTTAGAA; shATM2: TGATGGTCTTAAGGAACATCT) were provided in the
pLKO.1 plasmid by the Washington University in St. Louis
Children's Discovery Institute and the RNA interference (RNAi)

Results
The senescence effector pathways p53 and Rb are not
required to activate OPN
Activation of senescence is accompanied by upregulation of
protumorigenic factors collectively referred to as the SASP (5).
Our previous work revealed that one member of this group,
OPN, stimulates preneoplastic keratinocyte growth and is a
critical stromal-derived protumorigenic factor in a xenograft
model (4). Given the signiﬁcance of OPN in this model and the
importance of the other senescence-secreted proteins, we
investigated the regulation of OPN in senescence. We initially
turned our attention to the senescence effector and tumorsuppressor proteins p53 and Rb. Importantly, in human cells,
inhibition of either the p53 or Rb pathways alone is insufﬁcient
to bypass senescence while concomitant abrogation of these
pathways allows cells to bypass senescence (30). Despite the
importance of p53 and Rb in the activation of senescence,
previous work has shown that they actively suppress the
activation of some SASP factors including IL-6 and IL-8 (5).
However, p53 regulates OPN expression in mouse embryonic
ﬁbroblasts, raising the possibility that it plays a role in the
regulation of OPN in senescence (31). To investigate the
requirement for p53 and Rb activity in senescence-associated
OPN regulation, we ectopically expressed a well-characterized
dominant negative p53 cDNA (p53-DD; ref. 22) or a cDNA
expressing a fusion protein consisting of a mutant form of
cyclin-dependent kinase 4R24C (Cdk4) and DK that inhibits Rb
(22; Fig. 1A). Abrogation of either the p53 or Rb pathway alone
had no impact on the induction of senescence. Indeed, exposure of control cells or cells expressing p53-DD or DK to
bleomycin induced robust senescence as evidenced by growth
inhibition, the appearance of large ﬂattened cells and the
induction of SA-bgal (data not shown and Fig. 1B). We found

that neither abrogation of p53 nor Rb reduced OPN transcripts
upon activation of senescence (Fig. 1C). On the contrary, in the
absence of p53 or Rb, OPN basal levels in vehicle-treated cells
increased (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C), and they were
further augmented upon bleomycin treatment and the induction of senescence, arguing that p53 and Rb are not only
dispensable for the senescence-associated stimulation of OPN
expression, but that they suppress it. As previously reported,
IL-6 and IL-8 levels were also increased in senescent cells when
p53 and Rb function was compromised (Supplementary Fig.
S1A; ref. 5), indicating that the p53 and Rb pathways actively
suppress a wide range of SASP members.
Previous work had indicated that while SASP factors are
robustly activated in senescent cells, the induction of senescence was dispensable for SASP activation (5, 7). We next
wished to address whether OPN expression was dependent on
senescence activation. To address this question, we treated
immortalized WI38 ﬁbroblasts expressing the papilloma virus
E6 and E7 proteins, which abrogate p53 and Rb, respectively,
with bleomycin. As expected, bleomycin treatment of E6/E7expressing cells did not induce senescence (Supplementary
Fig. S1D). We found that these cells failed to acquire the
ﬂattened cellular morphology of senescent cells and did not
stain positive for SA-bgal (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Despite
the fact that E6/E7 cells failed to enter senescence, analysis of
OPN, IL-6, and IL-8 revealed that these cells retained the ability
to activate the SASP (Supplementary Fig. S1E), indicating that
SASP expression does not require the activation of the senescence effector proteins p53 and Rb nor entry into senescence.
SASP is controlled by distinct regulatory mechanisms
NF-kB is a master regulator of cytokine production in
inﬂammatory responses (32) and was recently implicated in
the transcriptional control of some SASP members, including
IL-6 and IL-8 (8, 16). Like IL-6, OPN can participate in cellular
responses characterized by chronic inﬂammation (17), and

2254

Cancer Res; 72(9) May 1, 2012

NF-kB can directly activate OPN transcription under certain
conditions (33). Therefore, we investigated whether NF-kB
activates OPN transcription in senescent cells. NF-kB canonically resides in a complex with IkBa, which sequesters it in the
cytoplasm. Upon stimulation, IkBa is phosphorylated and
subsequently degraded, allowing NF-kB to translocate to the
nucleus where it activates target gene transcription (32). We
successfully blocked NF-kB signaling by stably expressing a
mutant of IkBa that cannot be phosphorylated (IkBa-mut),
thus trapping NF-kB in the cytoplasm (23). To conﬁrm that the
mutant was active, we examined its impact on an NF-kB
reporter plasmid containing 5 tandem NF-kB–binding elements. In BJ ﬁbroblasts, as expected, we found that expression
of the reporter plasmid was inhibited in IkBa-mut cells
compared with cells expressing a vector control (Fig. 2A).
To determine whether NF-kB activity was required to
activate OPN in senescent cells, BJ ﬁbroblasts expressing a
control vector or the IkBa-mut were treated with bleomycin.
We found that bleomycin treatment induced robust senescence in the control and IkBa-mut–expressing cells as evidenced by the induction of a ﬂattened morphology and the
induction of SA-bgal (Fig. 2B), indicating that this mode of NFkB inhibition does not abrogate the induction of senescence in
these cells. In agreement with previous reports (16), we found
that NF-kB activation is essential for the upregulation of IL-6
and IL-8 in senescence (Fig. 2C). Indeed, we found that IkBamut cells treated with bleomycin failed to upregulate IL-6 and
IL-8. In contrast, OPN levels remained unperturbed in IkBamut cells treated with bleomycin (Fig. 2C). Because the expression of the IkBa mutant precedes the exposure to bleomycin,
our ﬁndings indicate that NF-kB signaling is neither required
for the initiation nor maintenance of OPN levels in response to
DNA damage. Together these ﬁndings also indicate that SASP
is regulated by at least 2 distinct transcriptional pathways.
Having established that neither the p53 or Rb pathways nor
activation of NF-kB plays a role in OPN regulation following

Regulation of Stroma-Derived OPN

bleomycin treatment and SASP activation, we next turned our
attention to the putative role of the DDR. Senescence is
characterized by a robust and persistent DDR (34) that
includes the activation of the ATM kinase, which has been
implicated in SASP activation (7). To address whether ATM
activation was required for OPN upregulation in senescent
cells, we used ATM-speciﬁc shRNA constructs to deplete cells
of ATM by more than 80% (Fig. 2D). As expected (7), ATM
depletion had no impact on the induction of senescence (Fig.
2E) but resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in IL-6 and IL-8 levels
(Fig. 2F). In contrast, ATM depletion had no impact on OPN
expression following bleomycin treatment (Fig. 2F). These
results indicate that OPN expression, unlike IL-6 and IL-8, is

www.aacrjournals.org

not controlled by DDR or NF-kB signaling in senescence, but
instead is regulated by a distinct mechanism.
HDAC inhibition induces SASP
A wide variety of cellular stresses can induce senescence.
Previous work showed agents that impact HDAC activity,
including sodium butyrate (NaB) and trichostatin A (TSA),
induce senescence or a senescence-like state in the absence of
DNA damage (12, 14). These ﬁndings raised the possibility that
chromatin modulation rather than bona ﬁde DNA breaks were
responsible for activation of the SASP. Therefore, we examined
whether double-strand DNA breaks were required for SASP
expression. BJ ﬁbroblasts were treated with NaB, which

resulted in a robust cell-cycle arrest and ﬂattened cellular
morphology but failed to activate SA-bgal activity (Supplementary Fig. S2). To assess the presence of DNA double-strand
breaks, we evaluated levels of gH2AX, a phosphorylated form of
the histone variant H2AX that is widely recognized as a marker
of double-strand breaks and active DDR (35). As a control for
gH2AX induction, we analyzed irradiated cells by Western blot
analysis and noted a robust increase in gH2AX as expected. In
contrast, NaB treatment did not increase gH2AX levels compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3A). The comet assay, a
sensitive technique used to detect DNA breaks in individual
cells (36), corroborated these results (data not shown) in
agreement with previous ﬁndings (14). Next, we examined
OPN mRNA levels and observed robust induction despite the
lack of detectable DNA damage (Fig. 3B). In agreement with
previous ﬁndings, both IL-6 and IL-8 also increased in NaBtreated cells (8). Together these ﬁndings indicate that DNA
breaks are not required for SASP induction.
HDAC inhibition in tumor cells results in reduced cell
growth and tumor cell death. Thus, recent work in xenografts and human clinical trials has focused on the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibition (37). These ﬁndings
have led to the approval of one such compound, SAHA or
vorinostat, for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,
with several other classes of HDAC inhibitors currently in
clinical trials (38). Given the putative clinical importance of
these inhibitors and our ﬁndings with NaB, we tested
whether other HDAC inhibitors activated the SASP. Indeed,

we found that other HDAC inhibitors including TSA, MS275,
and vorinostat similarly increased OPN, IL-6, and IL-8 levels
(Fig. 3B). We obtained identical results when we treated
primary breast ﬁbroblasts with NaB and vorinostat (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that HDAC inhibition also
elicits a SASP response in primary stromal cells. Together,
these ﬁndings raise concern that HDAC inhibitors may
impact the tumor microenvironment.
Above we show that the SASP is induced in the absence of
DNA double-strand breaks; however, ATM is activated in
cells treated with chromatin relaxers (39), raising the possibility that the DDR required to activate IL-6 and IL-8 is
initiated by a more general mechanism such as chromatin
modulation independently of physical damage. Given that in
bleomycin-induced senescence, ATM and NF-kB are
required for IL-6 and IL-8 upregulation (Fig. 2), we next
investigated whether both ATM and NF-kB were also
required to regulate IL-6 and IL-8 in NaB-treated cells. We
treated cells that express the IkBa-mut or AT cells (genetically deﬁcient in ATM activity) with NaB as above. Although
NaB does not induce DNA double-strand breaks [(14) and
data not shown], we found that IL-6 and IL-8 upregulation
retained their requirement for both NF-kB and ATM (Fig. 3C
and D). In contrast, we observed a robust upregulation of
OPN in IkBa-mut–expressing ﬁbroblasts and AT cells following NaB treatment (data not shown). Together these

that chromatin modulation is central to the regulation of
SASP factors.
HDAC inhibition creates a protumorigenic
microenvironment
Our ﬁnding that HDAC inhibition stimulates the tumorpromoting SASP (Fig. 3B) led us to investigate their impact
in vivo. To investigate this, we treated BJ ﬁbroblasts with
NaB, which led to the robust upregulation of OPN, IL-6, and
IL-8 (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and examined whether these
ﬁbroblasts promoted tumor growth in vivo. Similar to our
previous report, we found that bleomycin-treated ﬁbroblasts
signiﬁcantly promote preneoplastic HaCaTCBR cell growth
when coinjected in xenografts (Fig. 4A and B). When cells
were injected in combination with vehicle-treated ﬁbroblasts, there was minimal growth. Signiﬁcantly, the presence
of ﬁbroblasts treated with NaB also led to a substantial
enhancement of HaCATCBR cell growth compared with cells
injected with vehicle-treated ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 4A and B),
arguing that HDAC inhibition is a potent SASP inducer in
vivo. To further corroborate our ﬁndings, we tested the only
HDAC inhibitor currently used in the clinic—vorinostat.
Upon treatment with vorinostat, BJ ﬁbroblasts activated the
SASP (Supplementary Fig. S4B) and promoted HaCATCBR
cell growth compared with their vehicle counterparts (Fig.
4C and D). Together, our results indicate that HDAC inhibition in the stroma activates a protumorigenic proﬁle and
leads to increased tumor growth in vivo.
HDAC1 inhibition activates OPN
There are 3 major groups of HDACs (excluding sirtuins) and
18 HDACs are present in the human genome. Most HDAC

inhibitors target multiple HDACs; we next examined whether a
speciﬁc HDAC was critical for OPN activation. A recent study
analyzing stromal changes in breast cancer identiﬁed OPN as a
key component of a stroma-derived prognostic predictor that
successfully clustered tumors by clinical outcome (29). Oncomine-based interrogation of the same data set revealed that
HDAC1 levels were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) lower in breast
cancer–associated stroma compared with normal stroma
(Fig. 5A). Given that the SASP is reminiscent of the expression
proﬁle observed in CAFs and that the HDAC inhibitors used in
our study target HDAC1, we examined whether HDAC1 played
an important role in OPN activation.
To determine whether HDAC1 levels changed in vehicle
versus bleomycin-treated cells, we examined HDAC1 mRNA
levels by qPCR. In agreement with our previous microarray
data (4), we observed a decrease in HDAC1 mRNA levels in
bleomycin-treated ﬁbroblasts compared with vehicle-treated
cells (Fig. 5B). When we immunoprecipitated HDAC1 from
vehicle and bleomycin-treated ﬁbroblasts and assayed for
deacetylase activity, we observed a consistent decrease in cells
treated with bleomycin (Fig. 5C), raising the possibility that
loss of HDAC1 activity speciﬁcally contributes to OPN activation following bleomycin treatment.
To directly test whether HDAC1 activity was important for
the increase in OPN expression, we ectopically expressed a
dominant-negative mutant of HDAC1 (HDAC1-DN; ref. 24) in
ﬁbroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Although overexpression
of HDAC1-DN signiﬁcantly reduced cell proliferation, it did not
result in growth arrest or SA-bgal expression [(40) and Supplementary Fig. S5B]. However, we observed that ectopic
expression of HDAC1-DN was sufﬁcient to induce signiﬁcant
upregulation in OPN mRNA levels (Fig. 5D), mirroring the
response to treatments with HDAC inhibitors (Fig. 3B). This

ﬁnding further shows that the induction of the SASP can be
decoupled from the induction of senescence. Importantly, this
is an HDAC1-speciﬁc effect because ectopic expression of an
HDAC3 mutant (Supplementary Fig. S4C) did not alter OPN
levels (Fig. 5D). Analysis of IL-6 and IL-8 expression in HDAC1DN–expressing cells revealed that loss of HDAC1 activity was
also sufﬁcient to increase IL-8 and to a lesser extent IL-6 while
HDAC3-DN had no impact on either IL-6 or IL-8. Together,
these ﬁndings suggest that chromatin alterations via manipulation of HDAC1 activity impact the regulation of the SASP
independent of the activation of senescence.

Discussion
Senescent ﬁbroblasts promote tumorigenesis in multiple
models (3, 4). In efforts to understand how this is accomplished, several groups have examined the expression proﬁle of
senescent cells and uncovered a signature secretory program
enriched in growth factors, cytokines, and proteases termed
the SASP (4, 5, 15, 16). Speciﬁc SASP components have been
directly implicated in senescent stromal-promoted tumorigenesis (4, 6, 8, 15). However, it is still unclear how the SASP is
activated. Initial ﬁndings showed that the transcription factors
NF-kB and C/EBPb directly bind the promoters of some of the
inﬂammatory cytokines expressed in senescent cells (8, 15, 16).
In addition, the DDR was identiﬁed as an upstream SASP
inducer (7). Indeed, the above-mentioned transcription factors
can be activated in response to DNA damage (41, 42), although
the mechanism of activation in senescence is not known. Using
OPN as a surrogate for SASP regulation, we found that the SASP
is not characterized by a single transcriptional axis, but is
instead controlled by at least 2 independent signaling cascades

2258

Cancer Res; 72(9) May 1, 2012

both of which may be activated in response to chromatin
changes.
OPN impacts a vast array of signaling pathways, hence its
transcription is governed by multiple mechanisms in a tissueand context-dependent manner (17). We show that following a
senescence-inducing dose of bleomycin, OPN expression is not
controlled by p53, Rb, or NF-kB (31, 33). The lack of p53 and Rb
involvement is in agreement with previous work showing that
these essential senescence effector pathways are dispensable
for activation of the SASP factors IL-6 and IL-8 (5). Furthermore, our work shows that OPN, like other SASP factors
including IL-6 and IL-8, is expressed in cells that are unable
to senesce due to abrogation of the p53 and Rb pathways. This
ﬁnding is signiﬁcant because it shows that while senescent
cells express SASP factors, the induction of senescence is not
required to activate the SASP. Thus, SASP activation may occur
in a wide variety of stromal cells undergoing cellular stress. It is
interesting to note that the SASP is highly reminiscent of the
expression proﬁle observed in CAF, which like senescent cells
stimulate tumor formation in xenograft models (43).
This work and that of others show p53 and Rb are uniformly
dispensable for SASP expression, yet it is clear that SASP
regulation is complex and several distinct mechanisms drive
expression of speciﬁc SASP factors. Indeed, we show that
although NF-kB directly activates IL-6 and IL-8 (Fig. 2 and
data not shown), it is not required for OPN upregulation in
senescence (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Similarly, ATM knockdown has a profound effect on IL-6 and IL-8 expression, yet
OPN increases to the same levels as in control cells (Fig. 2).
Together, these results indicate that IL-6 and IL-8 are activated
by the DDR and NF-kB as has been shown (7, 8), and OPN is not.
Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that subsets of SASP are

Regulation of Stroma-Derived OPN

regulated by discrete signaling pathways. In fact, the SASP is
deﬁned by distinct classes of proteins such as growth factors,
mitogens, and extracellular remodeling enzymes (4) whose
activation may be governed by several mechanisms. Indeed,
our work shows that OPN regulation is distinct from the
inﬂammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 (15, 16). Discovery of
putative activators of OPN and whether they control the
expression of other proteins belonging to the ECM core of the
SASP is the subject of ongoing work (4).
Despite the fact that IL-6 and IL-8 are regulated independently of OPN, following the induction of senescence, all 3
factors increase at the mRNA level, arguing that there must be a
common inducer of SASP. Our work shows that ATM and
NF-kB are not the sole SASP regulators, raising the possibility
that an upstream stimulus initiates multiple signaling cascades. Our experiments with HDAC inhibitors show that in the
absence of DNA breaks (as measured by H2AX phosphorylation and comet assays [see Fig. 3 and (14)], the SASP is still
activated. Interestingly, ATM and NF-kB are still required for
the upregulation of IL-6 and IL-8 (Fig. 3) in HDAC inhibitor–
induced SASP, thus lending additional support to the argument that DNA damage signaling, but not breaks per se,
activates the SASP. HDAC inhibition modiﬁes the chromatin
by inducing hyperacetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins (44), resulting in sustained transcriptional changes (44).
The data presented here ﬁt a model wherein ATM activation
upon bleomycin and NaB treatment occurs in response to
chromatin alteration. It is known that DNA breaks induce
changes in the surrounding chromatin, which facilitates signaling and repair; conversely, chromatin modiﬁcations trigger
the DNA damage checkpoint (45). Indeed, because treatment
with an HDAC inhibitor activates ATM (39), it is plausible that
chromatin relaxation in senescence induces ATM activation
and subsequent IL-6 and IL-8 expression.
Although it is unclear how chromatin changes are instituted
and maintained in senescence, there is ample evidence for their
presence (11, 46). It is conceivable that widespread chromatin
modiﬁcations impact promoter activity globally. However,
only 2% of the genes are differentially regulated in senescence
(4) making this unlikely. Furthermore, speciﬁc transcription
factors (e.g., NF-kB and C/EBPb) are required for expression of
some SASP factors, pointing to a regulated mechanism of
expression. Finally, our results show that only speciﬁc chromatin modiﬁers impact OPN expression. Speciﬁcally, inhibition of HDAC1 but not HDAC3, upregulates OPN, IL-6, and IL-8
mRNA levels. Furthermore, we observe a reduction in HDAC1
levels and activity in senescent cells compared with their
vehicle-treated counterparts. Together these data argue that
HDAC1 containing complexes drive chromatin alterations that
then drive OPN expression. HDACs role in transcriptional
regulation is not limited to SASP. Indeed, HDAC1 inhibition
results in an altered transcriptional proﬁle in HGPS cells (27).
In addition, HDAC1 is decreased in breast cancer stroma [Fig.
5A and (29)], which also undergoes profound transcriptional
changes that alter the microenvironment and contribute to
tumorigenesis. What initiates the changes in chromatin in
these different biological settings is currently unknown and the
triggers are likely to vary depending on the biological context. It

is known that HDAC1 binds Rb (47) and interestingly, individual inhibition of either Rb or HDAC1 leads to marked
upregulation of OPN mRNA levels (Figs. 1 and 5), raising the
possibility that in nonsenescent cells HDAC1 complexes occupy SASP promoters and actively repress transcription, but
upon senescence induction, they translocate preferentially to
E2F targets (47). It remains to be determined whether the RbHDAC1 complex is targeted to the promoters of OPN and other
SASP members or whether it controls upstream regulators.
Our results add an additional layer of complexity to HDACs
and their putative involvement in the tumor microenvironment. Recently, signiﬁcant effort has been invested in designing HDAC inhibitors as anticancer agents leading to the
approval of 1 compound, vorinostat (also known as SAHA),
for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (48) and
several others currently in clinical trials (49). Most studies
focus on the antiproliferative or apoptotic effects of these
reagents on tumor cells and report a minimal impact on
normal cells (48, 50, 51). Our studies suggest that the impact
of HDAC inhibition on normal cells is quite different. When
normal cells, including ﬁbroblasts are treated with HDAC
inhibitors they are relatively resistant to apoptosis (52) but
enter a senescence-like state (14). Moreover, regardless of the
effect on cell-cycle progression, all the HDAC inhibitors we
tested (Fig. 3B) robustly upregulate SASP expression and
promote tumor growth in vivo in a paracrine fashion (Fig. 4).
The half-life of the HDAC inhibitors used in the clinic is
relatively short (52), limiting the therapeutic window for solid
malignancies (53). However, the molecular responses as measured by overall hyperacetylation are sustained following
treatment with HDAC inhibitors. Our results indicate that the
transcriptional changes associated with HDAC inhibitor treatment are maintained in normal ﬁbroblasts, and previous
studies have shown that the SASP is a chronic response (7).
Therefore, it will be important to assess sustained molecular
changes in the stroma that may lead to increased tumor
formation following HDAC therapy. Our work underscores the
importance of examining the tumor microenvironment when
analyzing the proﬁle of therapeutic agents.
