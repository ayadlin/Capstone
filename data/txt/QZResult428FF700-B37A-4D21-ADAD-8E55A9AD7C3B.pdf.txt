Abstract
Author Manuscript

Despite major advances in understanding the molecular and genetic basis of cancer, metastasis
remains the cause of >90% of cancer-related mortality1. Understanding metastasis initiation and
progression is critical to developing new therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent metastatic
disease. Prevailing theories hypothesize that metastases are seeded by rare tumour cells with
unique properties, which may function like stem cells in their ability to initiate and propagate
metastatic tumours2–5. However, the identity of metastasis-initiating cells in human breast cancer
remains elusive, and whether metastases are hierarchically organized is unknown2. Here we show

at the single-cell level that early stage metastatic cells possess a distinct stem-like gene expression
signature. To identify and isolate metastatic cells from patient-derived xenograft models of human
breast cancer, we developed a highly sensitive fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based
assay, which allowed us to enumerate metastatic cells in mouse peripheral tissues. We compared
gene signatures in metastatic cells from tissues with low versus high metastatic burden. Metastatic
cells from low-burden tissues were distinct owing to their increased expression of stem cell,
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, pro-survival, and dormancy-associated genes. By contrast,
metastatic cells from high-burden tissues were similar to primary tumour cells, which were more
heterogeneous and expressed higher levels of luminal differentiation genes. Transplantation of
stem-like metastatic cells from low-burden tissues showed that they have considerable tumourinitiating capacity, and can differentiate to produce luminal-like cancer cells. Progression to high
metastatic burden was associated with increased proliferation and MYC expression, which could
be attenuated by treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. These findings support
a hierarchical model for metastasis, in which metastases are initiated by stem-like cells that
proliferate and differentiate to produce advanced metastatic disease.
To investigate differentiation in metastatic cells, we used a micro-fluidics-based platform
(Fluidigm) for multiplex gene expression analysis in individual cells. This facilitated a
systems-level approach to study the simultaneous expression of groups of genes and resolve
cellular diversity during breast cancer metastasis only achievable at the single-cell level. We
designed single-cell experiments to investigate 116 genes involved in stemness,
pluripotency, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mammary lineage specification,
dormancy, cell cycle and proliferation (Supplementary Table 1)6–10.

We first developed a single-cell gene expression signature from normal human breast
epithelium to generate a reference for analysing differentiation in metastatic cells. The breast
contains two epithelial lineages: the basal/myoepithelial lineage that contains stem cells, and
a luminal lineage that contains progenitor and mature cell populations. We sorted single
basal/stem, luminal, and luminal progenitor cells from reduction mammoplasty samples
from three individuals, and processed them according to established protocols (Fig. 1a)10–13.
Principal component analysis (PCA) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that
basal and luminal cells represent distinct populations in each individual, as expected (Fig.
1b, d). Forty-nine of the one-hundred and sixteen genes tested showed differential
expression between basal/stem and luminal cells, and were used to generate a 49-gene
differentiation signature. This signature included established lineage-specific genes such as
KRT5, TP63, MUC1, CD24 and GATA3 (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Table 2 and
Supplementary Data 1), validating our multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) approach.
Mice from three genetically distinct triple-negative (ER−PR−HER2−), basal-like patientderived xenograft (PDX) models (HCI-001, HCI-002 and HCI-010) were analysed
(Extended Data Table 1)14. We focused on this subtype since it is the most aggressive,
metastasis is frequent, and there are no targeted therapeutics to treat it15. These PDX models
maintain the essential properties of the original patient tumours, including metastatic

tropism, making them authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer
metastasis14.

To isolate metastatic cells from PDX mice, we first developed a highly sensitive, speciesspecific FACS-based assay. We annotated published microarray data to identify cell surface
genes highly expressed in PDX breast cancer cells14. This revealed as a top candidate
CD298 (also known as ATP1B3), which is a β-subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPases that are
essential for basic cellular function16. Using a human species-specific antibody, we found
that CD298 is expressed by >99.9% of cells in three different human mammary cell lines,
with no background in mouse lines or control mouse peripheral tissues (Fig. 2b and
Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). In dissociated PDX primary tumours, all cells either expressed
human CD298 or mouse major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), indicating that
CD298 could detect nearly all cells (>99.5%) that were not of mouse origin (Fig. 2a). We
therefore expected that this assay would capture the majority of metastatic cells in PDX
mice, with negligible false-positive rates. CD298 was also superior to commonly used
markers, such as human EpCAM, CD24 and MHC I (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

Author Manuscript

We detected metastatic cells in peripheral tissues of 70/100 (70%) PDX mice using this
assay, including the lung, lymph node, bone marrow, liver, brain and peripheral blood
(Extended Data Table 1). All animals were analysed when their primary tumour reached 20–
25 mm in diameter, and primary tumour growth kinetics were consistent within each model
(Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). Although animals were analysed at the same endpoint, we
observed variation in metastatic burden by FACS and histology (Fig. 2b, c). We exploited
this to investigate gene expression in advanced-stage metastatic disease (high burden) versus
earlier-stage metastatic disease (low burden). In total we analysed over 20 mice, and show
comprehensive analysis of 441 metastatic and 523 primary tumour cells from 12 animals.
The tissues were rank ordered by burden, from lowest (light grey) to highest (black)
(Extended Data Fig. 2e). Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in the blood, and disseminated
tumour cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow were not included in the ranking since overt
metastasis was never observed in these tissues.

Author Manuscript

Remarkably, PCA plots for individual animals showed that in tissues with low burden,
metastatic cells were very distinct from the primary tumour cells they were derived from
(Fig. 3a). By contrast, metastatic cells from higher burden animals were more similar to
primary tumour cells. This was also observed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering of
pooled cells from all animals, which showed that low-burden metastatic cells form a unique
cluster, while higher-burden metastatic cells cluster with primary tumour cells (Extended
Data Fig. 3a). Most strikingly, we found that this was due to a conserved basal/stem-cell
signature in low-burden metastatic cells across all animals and models. Analysis of genes
comprising the 49-gene differentiation signature showed that low-burden metastatic cells
expressed higher levels of 22 basal/stem-cell genes, including LGR5, BMI1, BCL2,
NOTCH4 and JAG1, and lower levels of seven luminal genes, such as MUC1, EMP1 and
CD24 (Fig. 3b). Focusing on clustering of only the metastatic cells (Fig. 3c), we discovered
considerable heterogeneity in differentiation, which directly correlated with metastatic
burden. Akin to the normal mammary gland, metastatic cells organized into two distinct
clusters, where low-burden metastatic cells were most basal/stem-like, and higher-burden

metastatic cells possessed a spectrum of progressively more luminal-like expression
patterns. This was also observed when lung metastatic cells from each PDX model were
analysed separately (Extended Data Fig. 4a and Supplementary Data 2), indicating that it is
a conserved phenomenon in each model. Some differences in gene expression were
observed between lung metastatic cells from different patient models, but they were not
sufficient to cluster cells separately by PDX model (Extended Data Fig. 4c, d and
Supplementary Data 3).

Author Manuscript

To investigate heterogeneity at the protein level, we performed immunostaining for KRT5
(basal) and MUC1 (luminal) (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Tumour cells found in
micrometastases from low-burden tissues were largely KRT5+ (95.8%) and MUC1−
(94.3%), while cells from high-burden tissues were heterogeneous for KRT5 and largely
MUC1+ (72.9%). This suggests that differentiation status also correlates with metastatic
burden at the protein level.

Author Manuscript

By single-cell analysis, low-burden metastatic cells expressed very high levels of the
pluripotency genes POU5F1 (also known as OCT4) and SOX2, suggesting that they may
exploit embryonic programs for self-renewal and maintenance (Fig. 3b). Low-burden
metastatic cells also expressed higher levels of typical EMT markers such as SNAI2, SKP2
and TWIST1, and lower levels of CDH1, which was observed in normal basal/stem cells
(with the exception of TWIST1) (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Table 2). This is consistent with
previous reports showing that EMT promotes stemness in the mammary gland, and suggests
that low-burden metastatic cells may utilize an EMT program to facilitate
dissemination17,18. Gene ontology enrichment revealed that genes involved in the DNA
damage response, chromatin modification, differentiation, apoptosis and the cell cycle were
differentially expressed in low-burden metastatic cells (Supplementary Data 4). Extended
Data Table 2 and Supplementary Data 5 list all 55 genes (of 116 analysed) that were
differentially expressed in low-burden metastatic cells.
The heterogeneity observed in metastatic cells raised the question of whether stem-like
metastatic cells directly give rise to luminal-like cells, or whether they originate from
distinct founder cells. To test first whether cells that disseminate at early phases of primary
tumour growth can produce luminal-like metastatic cells, we resected primary tumours when
they were only 10–12 mm in diameter and allowed metastases to grow for 8 weeks. Singlecell analysis of the resulting lung metastatic cells showed that 85.4% were luminal-like, and
clustered with high-burden metastatic cells from previous experiments (Extended Data Fig.
4b). This suggests that luminal-like metastases can derive from cells that disseminate at
earlier stages of primary tumour growth.

To test the growth and differentiation capacity of stem-like meta-static cells directly, we
transplanted low-burden metastatic cells into mammary glands. Remarkably, two of four
transplants produced large tumours (Extended Data Fig. 5a), by contrast with primary
tumour cells, which did not produce tumours even at 100-fold higher numbers. This is
consistent with previous reports indicating that PDX tumours are more efficiently
propagated as fragments than dissociated cells19. Single-cell analysis of the resulting tumour
cells showed that 98.7% of them were luminal-like, and clustered with primary tumour cells

and high-burden metastatic cells from previous experiments (Extended Data Fig. 5b). This
suggests that low-burden metastatic cells have considerable tumour-initiating capacity, and
can give rise to luminal-like tumour cells, supporting the hypothesis that stem-like metastatic cells give rise to luminal-like ones.

Author Manuscript

A compelling question raised in this study is whether stem-like cells are present in primary
tumours, or whether they evolve later through interaction with their new microenvironment.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering shows that 1.4% of primary tumour cells cluster with
low-burden metastatic cells and possess a basal/stem-like phenotype (Extended Data Fig.
3a). This is consistent with previous findings that rare invasive ‘leader’ cells on the
periphery of primary tumours express basal cell markers20. Interestingly, the most metastatic
PDX model (HCI-010) had the highest percentage of basal/stem-like primary tumour cells,
while the least metastatic model (HCI-002) had the lowest. This suggests that primary
tumours contain a rare subpopulation of stem-like cells, and that the percentage correlates
with metastatic potential. This led us to investigate whether enrichment of this stem-like
signature in primary tumours may be predictive of distant metastasis in human patient data
sets. By Kaplan–Meier analysis, we found that 16 of 55 genes associated with stem-like
metastatic cells were significantly prognostic (Supplementary Data 6). Future studies to
determine whether the frequency of stem-like cells in primary tumours can be used as a
predictive biomarker for metastasis may be clinically valuable.

Author Manuscript

Previous work has shown that metastatic cells in different organs display distinct gene
expression signatures2. Consistent with this, by supervised clustering of cells by target
organ, we found that metastatic cells in the brain, bone marrow and peripheral blood
displayed distinct gene expression patterns (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Brain metastatic cells
were the most distinct, and expressed the highest levels of stem cell, quiescence and antiapoptosis genes. In total, 80 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the
populations (Extended Data Fig. 6b, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Data 7).
CTCs are of particular clinical interest for use as a ‘liquid biopsy’ for diagnosis and
prognosis. Although only rare CTCs could be recovered, they most closely resembled lung
metastatic cells, and were least similar to brain metastatic cells (Extended Data Fig. 6c).
Interestingly, most CTCs and bone marrow DTCs clustered with ‘intermediate’ metastatic
cells, which may be because the cells were harvested from animals with intermediate burden
(Extended Data Fig. 2e). However, 16.7% and 10.7%, respectively, showed a more basal/
stem-like signature (Fig. 3c, basal/stem-like cluster), suggesting that these stem-like cells
may represent the true metastatic seeder cells.

Author Manuscript

We also observed a shift towards a more proliferative signature associated with increased
metastatic burden. Low-burden metastatic cells expressed higher levels of quiescence and
dormancy-associated genes, including CDKN1B, CHEK1, TGFBR3 and TGFB2 (Fig. 4a,
b)21,22. Higher-burden metastatic cells appeared to enter the cell cycle, expressing lower
levels of quiescence and dormancy-associated genes and higher levels of cell-cyclepromoting genes such as MYC and CDK2, as well as MMP1 and CD24, which have been
associated with reactivation after dormancy. This distinction was further corroborated by
unsupervised hierarchical clustering, showing that low- and high-burden meta-static cells

form distinct clusters based on differential expression of these genes (Fig. 4c). Of note, the
majority of metastatic cells in the dormant cluster were also in the basal/stem-cell cluster
depicted in Fig. 3c, demonstrating a correlation between dormancy and stem-cell-related
gene expression in metastatic cells. We also detected primary tumour cells (22.2%) with this
less-proliferative signature (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Immunostaining for MYC, phosphohistone H3 and Ki67 confirmed that micrometastases show lower MYC expression and
proliferative index (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 7a, b).

Author Manuscript

These findings prompted us to test whether blocking this switch from dormancy into the cell
cycle could inhibit metastatic progression. Since we observed high levels of both MYC and
CDK2 in more advanced stage metastatic cells (Fig. 4b), we chose to test dinaciclib, a CDK
inhibitor that has been shown to induce apoptosis in high MYC-expressing cancer cells via
synthetic lethality23,24. We hypothesized that apoptosis would be induced in metastatic cells
transitioning into proliferation, since they appear to upregulate MYC. We administered
dinaciclib to a total of 49 mice from two PDX models, HCI-001 and HCI-002, which were
from drug-naive patients. After a 4-week treatment course, we found that only 1 of 24 drugtreated animals displayed metastatic cells, in comparison to 44% (11/25) of vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 4e). Although tumour growth was delayed in drug-treated animals, many
developed sizeable tumours by the endpoint, suggesting that the effect was not simply due to
inhibition of the primary tumour (Extended Data Fig. 7c–e). By looking in high resolution at
gene expression in single metastatic cells, we have uncovered previously unrealized
diversity in differentiation and gene expression relating to the metastatic stage (Extended
Data Fig. 8), and demonstrate that this approach can facilitate the identification of new
potential drug targets with efficacy against metastatic disease.

METHODS
Cell line and animal experiments

Author Manuscript

All cell lines used in the study were pre-validated and grown using standard protocols that
can be found on the American Type Culture Collection. The University of California, San
Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) reviewed and approved
all animal experiments. PDX tumour tissues were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm
and serially passaged as ~8 mm3 tumour fragments into the cleared inguinal fat pads of prepubescent NOD/SCID mice following established protocols14. When tumours became
palpable, they were calipered weekly to monitor growth kinetics. Tumour fragments were
stored by freezing in 90% FBS and 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in liquid nitrogen.
Clinical details of patients used for generation of each PDX model are detailed elsewhere14.
All PDX animals were euthanized at the endpoint unless otherwise noted, when tumours
reached 20–25 mm. In resection experiments, tumours were surgically removed at 10–12
mm. Resected animals were replaced in the colony and allowed to grow metastases for 8
weeks, at which time lung tissues were harvested, digested, and analysed by FACS for
human cells.
For orthotopic transplant experiments for functional activity of metastatic cells, lymph node
metastatic cells from animals with <500 CD298+ metastatic cells in the lymph nodes were
isolated by FACS and pooled from several animals. CD298+ primary tumour cells from

matched animals were also isolated by FACS. Sorted cells were pelleted and resuspended in
1:1 Matrigel plus DMEM/F12 media. Sample dilutions were injected into cleared mammary
fat pads of 3.5-week-old NOD/SCID mice. Grafts were harvested 4.5 months later when
primary tumours reached 20 mm.
Dinaciclib treatment experiments

Author Manuscript

Dinaciclib was prepared and administered according to previously established protocols in
mice23,25. Dinaciclib was reconstituted in 20% hydroxypropyl β cyclodextrin (HPBCD).
Animals were randomly assigned into treatment or control groups when tumour cells were
transplanted, and mice were analysed using a single-blind design. The drug treatment course
was initiated when tumours became palpable. A total of 49 animals (HCI-001 and HCI-010)
were treated by i.p. injection three times per week at 30 mg kg−1 of drug, or vehicle
(HPBCD), a previously established dose in mice25. Animal group size was chosen by power
analysis, using a two-tailed α of 0.05 with 80% power, and the frequencies of metastasis that
we observed in each model (Extended Data Table 1). Animals were measured by caliper
twice weekly to record primary tumour growth. Mice were euthanized at the conclusion of a
4-week treatment course, or earlier if their tumours reached the IACUC-established ethical
endpoint (20 mm in diameter). Animals that developed adverse effects (for example, >20%
weight loss) were excluded from the study. Statistical significance between drug- and
vehicle-treated groups was examined by two-tailed, unpaired t-tests.
Bioinformatics and computational analysis of microarray data sets

Author Manuscript

Published microarray data sets (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession number
GSE32531) on the PDX models were downloaded from the GEO database14. Microarray
gene expression values were calculated by global median normalization and annotated with
GeneSpring GX 12.0 software (Agilent Technologies). Plasma membrane genes highly
expressed across all 15 PDX tumour samples and 12 original patient tumour samples
included in the study were rank ordered from highest to lowest expression across all the
samples using the GENE-E package26.

Author Manuscript

The prognostic value of each of the 55 genes characteristic of low-burden metastatic cells
(Extended Data Table 2) was determined by Kaplan–Meier analysis using KM-plotter online
software (http://kmplot.com/analysis/)27. The relationship of gene expression and distant
metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (n =1,610) was evaluated in an integrated multi-study
breast cancer microarray data set containing 13 breast cancer expression profiling data sets
from GEO. Kaplan–Meier estimates of DMFS were calculated by setting the software to
look for the optimal cut-off for separation of patients into high- and low-expressing groups.
The hazard ratio, log-rank P value, and number of patients in each group are shown on the
KM plot for each gene.
Tissue dissociation
All solid tissues, including primary tumour, liver, lungs, lymph nodes (axillary, brachial,
cervical, sciatic and lumbar) and brain were dissociated for FACS using the same protocol.
Briefly, tissues were mechanically chopped with scalpels, placed in culture medium
(DMEM/F12 with 5% FBS, 5 μg ml−1 insulin (UCSF Cell Culture Facility), 50 ng ml−1

They were then digested for 45 min at 37 °C. The resulting suspensions were resuspended in
2 U μl−1 DNase for 3 min at room temperature, washed and dissociated with 2 ml of 0.05%
trypsin/EDTA (UCSF Cell Culture Facility) for 10 min at 37 °C. Peripheral blood was
collected by effusion with 10 mM EDTA in D-PBS, followed by mixture with 2% dextran in
D-PBS for sedimentation of red blood cells using standard methods. After 1 h, supernatant
was collected and cells were pelleted at 1,500 r.p.m. for 5 min. Bone marrow was collected
by removing all tissue from femur and tibia and flushing marrow with 1 × PBS using a 27G
needle. Residual erythrocytes in peripheral blood, lung and tumour samples were lysed with
Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer for 5 min at room temperature. All samples not used
immediately were filtered through a 70 μm filter, and frozen in DMEM/F12 with 50% serum
and 10% DMSO, and stored in liquid N2.

Reduction mammoplasty samples were acquired from the Cooperative Human Tissue
Network (CHTN), a program funded by the National Cancer Institute. Tissues were washed
three to five times with PBSA (1× Dulbecco’s PBS supplemented with 200 U ml−1
penicillin, 200 μg ml−1 streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 5 μg ml−1 Fungizone (Invitrogen)).
Tissues were minced into small fragments and digested overnight in collagenase-Icontaining solution as previously described28. Digested organoids were pelleted in a
centrifuge at 100g for 3 min and frozen and stored in liquid N2 as described earlier.

Antibodies for the human antigens CD45 (Alexa-450, eBioscience), CD31 (Alexa-450,

eBioscience), CD117/cKit (FITC, eBioscience), CD24 (APC, eBioscience) and MHC I
(APC, eBioscience) were purchased commercially. For mouse antigens, CD45 (FITC,
eBioscience), Ter119 (FITC, eBioscience), CD31 (FITC, eBioscience) and MHC I (APC,
eBioscience) were used. All antibodies were validated in previous publications10–13, or in
this study directly (CD298). Antibody staining was performed in DMEM/5% FBS
supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. After 15 min on ice, stained cells were
washed of excess unbound antibodies and resuspended in medium. Flow sorting was done
using a BD FACSAriaII cell sorter (Becton Dickinson), and analysis was done on an LSRII
(Becton Dickinson). Forward-scatter height versus forward-scatter width (FSC-H versus
FSC-W) and side-scatter area versus side-scatter width (SSC-A versus SSC-W) were used to
eliminate cell aggregates and ensure single cell sorting. Dead cells were eliminated by
excluding Sytox positive (SYTOX Blue dead cell stain, Molecular Probes) cells, which
increased the efficiency of sorting robust, live cells for single-cell experiments.
Contaminating human or mouse haematopoietic and endothelial cells were excluded by
gating out Lin+ (CD45, Ter119, CD31) cells. In Fig. 2a, Sytox+mLin+ cells were pre-gated
out, and the percentages shown reflect the remaining population. Control mammary:

(Extended Data Fig. 2e, #Cells), the entire tissue sample was run through the flow
cytometer. A consistent number of live cells was found in tissues from each animal. In any
case where live cell yields deviated from the average by more than one standard deviation,
mice were excluded from the study (Supplementary Data 8 shows histograms for cell yields
from lung and lymph nodes). In Extended Data Table 1 and Fig. 4e, animals or tissues were

Single-cell gene-expression experiments were performed using Fluidigm’s 96.96 qPCR
DynamicArray microfluidic chips. Single cells were sorted by FACS into individual wells of
96-well PCR plates, using the FACSAriaII single-cell sorting protocol with specific
adjustments (device: 96-well PCR plate; precision: single-cell; nozzle: 100 μm).
Experiments were performed according to Fluidigm’s Advanced Development Protocol 41.
Each well of 96-well PCR plates was preloaded with 9 μl volume of RT-STA solution: 5 μl
of CellsDirect PCR mix (Invitrogen), 0.2 μl of SuperScript-III RT/Platinum Taq mix
(Invitrogen), 1.0 μl of a mixture of all pooled primer assays (500 nM), and 2.8 μl of DNA
suspension buffer (TEKnova). After sorting, PCR plates were frozen (−20 °C) or placed into
a thermocycler for combined reverse transcription (50 °C for 15 min, 95 °C for 2 min) and
target-specific amplification (20 cycles; each cycle: 95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 4 min).
Technical replicates were not performed, as the manufacturer recommends a greater number
of biological replicates in lieu of technical replicates yields more power and better sampling
of the target population. 3.6 μl of exonuclease reaction solution (2.52 μl H20, 0.36 Exo
reaction buffer, and 0.72 μl ExoI, New England BioLabs) was then added to remove
unincorporated primers (37 °C for 30 min, 80 °C for 15 min). Subsequently, each well was
diluted 1:3 with TE buffer (TEKnova). In a separate plate, a 2.7 μl aliquot from each sample
well was then mixed with 2.5 μl of SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix with Low Rox (Bio-Rad)
and 0.25 μl of Fluidigm’s DNA Binding Dye Sample Loading Reagent. Plates were
centrifuged to mix solutions. In another separate plate, individual primer assay mixes were
generated by loading 2.5 μl of Assay Loading Reagent (Fluidigm), 2.25 μl DNA Suspension
Buffer, and 0.25 μl of 100 μM primer pair mix. Before loading primer assays and sample
mixes into each chip, chips were primed by injecting control line fluid (Fluidigm) and
running the ‘Prime’ program in the IFX Controller HX. After priming, 5 μl of each sample
and primer mix were loaded into each well of the chips. Samples and assays were then
mixed in the chip by running the ‘Load Mix’ program in the IFC Controller HX. Chips were
transferred into the BioMark real-time PCR reader (Fluidigm) and run according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. A list of primer assays used in this study is provided in
Supplementary Table 1. All primer sequences were acquired through the Harvard Primer
bank, and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Primer assays were run on
Fluidigm’s dynamic arrays using an iterative approach, where genes that were not
informative were replaced in subsequent experiments. Thorough technical evaluations of the
micro-fluidics array technology, limits of detection, and efficiency of multiplex PCR in this
platform have been reported by Fluidigm and several independent reports29–31.

Computational analysis, display, and statistical assessment of single-cell PCR data sets

Author Manuscript

All single-cell PCR data were analysed using Fluidigm’s Real-time PCR analysis software,
using the Linear (Derivative) and User (Detectors) settings to generate Ct values for each
gene. Ct values were further processed in the R statistical language32, using algorithms we
generated. All code is provided in Supplementary Information, and published in GitHub
(https://github.com/) for upload into R. Single-cell multiplex qPCR data are available at the
NCBI GEO database (accession GSE70555). Over 20 mice were analysed, but data from 12
PDX mice are included (in which a similar gene set was analysed). Mammary epithelial
cells from three reduction mammoplasty patients were also analysed. In total, 268 mammary
cells from reduction mammoplasties, and 441 metastatic and 523 primary tumour cells from
PDX mice were analysed.

Author Manuscript

In normal mammary cell experiments, Ct values were normalized by subtracting the average
value of the basal/stem-cell population on a per-gene, per-array basis to correct for batch-tobatch differences in reverse transcription, pre-amplification, and real-time PCR. In PDX
experiments, Ct values were normalized by subtracting the average primary tumour
expression from the same individual animal on a per-gene basis, to identify conserved
differences in gene expression in metastatic cells relative to the primary tumour cells they
derive from, in addition to correction of batch-to-batch differences. Normalization using
housekeeping genes was not performed, as it is not recommended for single-cell qPCR33.
Normalized Ct values were converted to relative log2 expression values simply through
multiplication by −1. Low-quality samples were identified and removed from further
analysis in most experiments if less than 80% of the assayed genes amplified. Gene
expression data were displayed by PCA, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, supervised
clustering, and box plots. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed on both
metastatic cells and genes based on Pearson’s correlation distance metric and average
linkage, after z-score standardization of the log2 expression values for each gene across all
samples (Fig. 3c). In all other PDX heatmaps, genes were not clustered, but instead the gene
order was maintained for consistency. For all heatmaps, the limits of the blue/red colour
scale are set to span 90% of the data based on a normal distribution, to prevent outliers from
compressing the colours of the majority of the data. For PCA, in which missing data are not
easily accommodated, a lower limit of detection approach was taken, in which failed
reactions were set to a log2 expression value one lower than the minimum observed value
across all samples for each gene separately.

Author Manuscript

To identify gene expression differences between predefined populations, several statistical
tests were performed. For normal mammary cell experiments, we first performed threegroup comparisons between basal/stem, luminal, and luminal progenitor cells (both
parametric: analysis of variance (ANOVA); and non-parametric: Kruskal–Wallis). This
yielded a list of 49 differentially expressed genes (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 2). To
determine which genes were characteristic of each population, we subsequently performed
pair-wise tests (parametric: moderated t-test; and non-parametric: Mann–Whitney U test). In
metastatic cell versus primary tumour cell experiments, only pair-wise comparisons were
performed. Three-group comparisons were performed to compare lung metastatic cells from
the three PDX models, and five-group comparisons were performed to compare metastatic

cells from each tissue. In these analyses, ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis group tests were
performed followed by post-hoc pairwise analyses using Tukey and Chi-squared tests. In
low- versus high-burden metastatic cell comparisons, low burden was defined as <250
human cells detected in the entire tissue, and high burden was defined as >1,000 cells.
Intermediate burden was defined as in between 250 and 1,000 human cells detected. As we
were only analysing assays for which at least one cell yielded amplification, undetectable
amplification represented non-expression rather than technical error in the PCR reaction. To
capture non-expression in the statistical tests, failed reactions were set to a value 0.01 lower
than the lowest observed value across all samples for each gene separately. For the nonparametric tests described earlier, the specific value chosen is not important, while for the
parametric tests, this method is comparable to using a lower limit of detection. Our
algorithm selected the most appropriate test from which to report a P value based on the
type of data observed for that gene (non-parametric if>50% of samples failed for either
group, parametric otherwise). This criterion was chosen in an attempt to prevent a high
proportion of failed values masking group differences. All P values were also adjusted for
the fact that many genes were being simultaneously analysed by controlling the false
discovery rate (FDR) with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. To identify basal/stem-cellcharacteristic genes, we compared basal/stem (B) to both luminal (L) and luminal progenitor
cells (LP) (that is, B versus (L and LP)). Luminal genes were identified by performing L
versus B, and luminal progenitor genes by performing LP versus L (since they are a subset
of the L lineage). Log-fold changes were computed as a difference between the mean of the
log2-normalized expression values for one group versus the mean of the values for the other
group; failed reactions were first replaced using the lower limit of detection approach
described above.

Author Manuscript

Enrichment analysis of Biological Process gene ontology terms was performed using the
GOstats R package, using the conditional parameter. This was done to identify pathways
that were more represented in the set of significantly differentially expressed genes than
would be expected by chance alone.
Histological and immunofluorescent analysis

Author Manuscript

Tissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for paraffin
embedding. For histological analysis, sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin
using standard methods. Immunofluorescent staining was performed on lung tissues with
low and high metastatic burden. We defined low burden as fewer than 10 small detectable
lesions, containing fewer than 20 cells each. High burden was defined as greater than 25
lesions, with large numbers of cells (at least 1,000 in total). Metastatic lesions were
identified by the size of the nuclei, as tumour cell nuclei were 2–3 times larger than
surrounding nuclei in the lung. Metastatic lesions were also often encircled by basement
membrane and stroma, making them easily identifiable. Immunostaining on paraffinembedded tissue sections was performed using standard protocols, using citrate buffer (pH
6.0) and heating in a pressure cooker for 8 min. MUC1 (Sigma, HPA008855, 1:100) and
KRT5 (Biolegend, PRB-160P, 1:1,000) were stained using a three-step technique, where
primary antibodies were incubated overnight, followed by 1 h incubations with a
biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary (DAKO, 1:500) and subsequently a Streptavidin

Alexa-568 (Invitrogen, 1:1,000). MYC (abcam, ab32072,1:100) and phospho-histone H3
(Cell Signaling Technology, 1:100) were identified using a two-step technique, where
overnight primary antibody stains were followed by a 1 h incubation with a goat anti-rabbit
Alexa-568 secondary (Molecular Probes, 1:1,000). The number of positive nuclei was
counted in several fields for each group (tumour, high burden, and low burden), and
significance was calculated by single-factor ANOVA and pair-wise t-tests assuming equal
variance.

Extended Data Figure 8. Model for tumour cell heterogeneity during metastasic progression

Author Manuscript

a, Metastatic cells from animals with low metastatic burden (blue) are distinct from animals
with higher burden, due to their increased expression of stemness, anti-apoptosis, EMT, and
dormancy/ quiescence-related genes. In contrast, higher burden metastatic cells are more
heterogeneous, and comprise larger numbers of proliferative, differentiated cells (red).
Transplant experiments of stem-like metastatic cells showed that they have tumour-initiating
potential, and can produce luminal-like cancer cells. This strongly suggests that metastases
derive from stem-like cells, which differentiate and undergo a switch from dormancy into
proliferation as they colonize and produce more advanced metastatic tumours. Metastatic
progression was also associated with increased MYC expression, and could be attenuated
with CDK inhibition. We believe this is due to apoptosis of cells as they upregulate MYC,
since our previous work has shown that CDK inhibition induces apoptosis in high MYCexpressing cancer cells through synthetic lethality23. b, Comparison of gene signatures in
primary tumour and metastatic cells showed that 1.4% of primary tumour cells, and 16.7%
