BACKGROUND. It was recently reported that high expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c (PPARc) and low expression of cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) might be involved in the inhibition of ovarian tumor progression and
confirmed that PPARc activation could suppress COX-2 expression via the nuclear
factor-jB pathway in ovarian cancer cells.

METHODS. The current study investigated whether meloxicam, a selective COX-2

inhibitor, and ciglitazone, a ligand for PPARc, inhibit the growth of human ovarian cancer cell lines and aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of their
antitumor effect. Tumor growth and survival were examined in female nu/nu
mice xenografted with subcutaneous OVCAR-3 tumors or with intraperitoneal
DISS tumors and treated with meloxicam (162 ppm in diet, every day) or ciglitazone (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally once a week).

RESULTS. Both meloxicam and ciglitazone treatments significantly suppressed
the growth of OVCAR-3 tumors xenotransplanted subcutaneously and significantly prolonged the survival of mice with malignant ascites derived from DISS
cells as compared with controls. Meloxicam treatment decreased COX-2 expression in tumors by 2.5-fold compared with that observed in untreated tumors.
Although ciglitazone treatment did not alter COX-2 expression in tumors, it
reduced the expression of microsomal prostaglandin (PG) E synthase, which converts COX-derived PGH2 to PGE2. Both meloxicam and ciglitazone decreased
PGE2 levels in serum as well as in ascites. Reduced microvessel density and
induced apoptosis were found in solid OVCAR-3 tumors treated with either
meloxicam or ciglitazone.

CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that both meloxicam and ciglitazone produce antitumor effects against ovarian cancer in conjunction with reduced angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis. Cancer 2007;110:791–800.  2007 American

varian cancer is an insidious disease that has few specific symptoms in the early stages and most women with this disease
present with an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. The current
management of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer generally
includes cytoreductive surgery followed by combination chemotherapy. The combination of paclitaxel with a platinum analog is the
preferred chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with this disease.1 Although such management

induces favorable results in the treatment of ovarian
cancer, the long-term survival of ovarian cancer
patients remains unsatisfactory2 and an estimated
130,000 deaths per year still occur from ovarian cancer worldwide.3 Acquisition of drug tolerance by
ovarian cancer cells is regarded as 1 of the causes
underlying the failure to prolong the survival period
of ovarian cancer patients.4 Although it is important
to elucidate the mechanisms of drug resistance to
overcome it, new medications, especially medications distinct from the known chemotherapeutic
agents, remain to be developed with a view to
improving survival and cure rates in ovarian cancer.
Cyclooxygenase (COX) has 2 isoforms, the constitutive COX-1 and the inducible COX-2.5 COX-1 is
expressed in most tissues, whereas COX-2 is largely
absent but is primarily responsible for prostaglandins
(PGs) produced in inflammatory sites, suggesting
that COX-2 plays a critical role in inflammation.6
Epidemiologic studies have shown a 40% to 50%
reduction in mortality from colorectal carcinoma in
continuous users of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) compared with that of noncontinuous users.7 The antitumor effect of NSAIDs is due to
their inhibition of COX-2.8 Many lines of evidence
suggest that COX-2 might be involved in various
aspects of carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and recurrence.9,10 Shigemasa et al.11 reported that COX-2
expression might play an important role in the development of ovarian cancer. Ferrandina et al.12
demonstrated that increased COX-2 expression was
associated with chemotherapy resistance and outcome in ovarian cancer patients and then Denkert
et al.13 reported that COX-2 expression was an independent prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. Pharmacologic studies suggest that COX-2 is a useful
therapeutic target and COX-2 inhibitors reduce the
formation, growth and metastasis of experimental
tumors.14,15 Conversely, more recently COX-1 has
also been found to play an important role in the
growth of some types of malignant tumors via the
production of angiogenic growth factor.16,17
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c
(PPARc) is a member of a nuclear hormone receptor
superfamily and provides a strong link between lipid
metabolism and the regulation of gene transcription.18 Ligand-mediated activation of PPARc has
been linked to cellular differentiation, apoptosis, and
antiinflammatory responses.19 Significant evidence
from many experimental systems suggests that
PPARc plays an important role in carcinogenesis.
PPARc is up-regulated in malignant tissues, and
ligands for PPARc inhibit the growth of human colon,
breast, gastric, and lung cancer cells.19–22 We recently

reported that PPARc activation could suppress COX-2
expression via the nuclear factor-jB pathway in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting the potential of PPARc
ligands as a new agent in the treatment of ovarian
malignancies.23
Meloxicam is used worldwide as an NSAID and
is categorized as a selective COX-2 inhibitor. It has
been reported that meloxicam has an inhibitory
effect on colorectal cancer cells24 and nonsmall-cell
lung cancer cells.25 Conversely, ciglitazone is used
clinically as an antihyperglycemic agent and is categorized as a PPARc ligand. Ciglitazone decreases
COX-2 expression and induced apoptosis in human
colon cancer cells overexpressing COX-2.26 Although
there has been significant interest in the role of
COX-2 inhibitors and PPARc ligands in colon, breast,
and lung cancers,26–28 data on COX-2 inhibitors and
PPARc ligands in ovarian malignancies are quite
scant. In this study we investigated the effect of
meloxicam and ciglitazone on the growth of malignant ovarian tumors in vivo and aimed to elucidate
the molecular mechanism of their antitumor effect.
As a positive control for antitumor activity, we used
cisplatin (cis-diaminedichloroplatinum [II]), which is
a DNA-damaging agent used in the chemotherapy of
human malignancy and is considered 1 of the key
drugs for ovarian cancer treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines and Cell Culture
OVCAR-3 was obtained from the American TypeCulture Collection (Rockville, MD) and DISS was kindly
provided by Dr. Saga (Jichi Medical School, Tochigi,
Japan). Both cell lines were derived from human
epithelial ovarian adenocarcinoma, grown in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 lg/mL
streptomycin at 378C in a water-saturated atmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide/95% air. Both cell
lines grow in monolayer.

Animal Experimentation
Animal experiments were conducted in accordance
with the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation, Hirosaki University. Eight-week-old female BALB/c nu/
nu mice were used in this study. All mice were
group-housed in plastic cages with stainless-steel
grid tops in an air-conditioned and 12-hour lightdark cycle-maintained room at the Institute for Animal Experiments of Hirosaki University and consumed water and food ad libitum.

Cancer-Bearing Mouse Model
OVCAR-3 cells (5 3 106 cells) were inoculated subcutaneously in 500 lL of RPMI-1640 medium in the
back region of the nude mice. All the mice were
numbered, housed separately, and examined twice
weekly for tumor development. One week after
inoculation, small tumors were identified. Tumors
were grown until the longer dimension reached 2
mm before starting treatment. The experimental
mice were then divided into 4 groups containing 10
mice each (Day 0). Controls received only the basal
diet. Each mouse in the meloxicam group was
housed separately and given a solid diet supplemented with 162 ppm meloxicam (Boehringer Ingelheim,
Germany) every day until the end of the study.29
Consumption was monitored every day. The ciglitazone group was administered ciglitazone (TOCRIS
Bioscience, St. Louis, Mo) at a dose of 15 mg/kg intraperitoneally once a week until the end of the
study.30 The cisplatin group was administered cisplatin (Nippon Kayaku, Tokyo, Japan) at a dose of 5 mg/
kg intraperitoneally once on Day 0. The tumor
dimensions were measured twice weekly using a vernier caliper and tumor volume was determined by
external measurement according to the published
method. Volume was determined by the equation V
(mm3) 5 L 3 W2 3 0.5, in which L is length and W
is width.31 Serum PGE2 concentration was determined on Day 7 and the mice were sacrificed on Day
21 to remove the tumor for pathologic and biochemical studies. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the
removed tumors showed human ovarian epithelial
malignancy (data not shown).
Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Mouse Model
DISS cells (0.5 3 107 cells) were inoculated into the
peritoneal cavity of nude mice in 500 lL of sterile
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). It has been
reported that the average survival of DISS cell-transplanted mice is about 30 days.32 The experimental
mice were divided into 4 groups of 10 mice each. After confirming ascites on Day 7 the mice were treated in the same way as in the cancer-bearing mouse
model. Ascites was aspirated on Day 21 for the determination of PGE2 and VEGF concentrations, then the
survival time for each group was evaluated.
Western Blot Analysis
Removed tumor tissues were cut into small pieces
and homogenized in PIPA buffer in ice. The homogenate was incubated overnight at 48C followed by
centrifuging at 15,000g for 15 minutes at 48C. The
supernatant fluids (50 lg protein) were electrophoresed through a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-

793

polyacrylamide gel and blotted as described previously.23 The protein concentration was determined
using the Bradford method. The blots were probed
with the following primary antibodies: COX-2 (IBL,
Gunma, Japan) at 2 lg/mL, PPAR-g (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Mich) at 1 lg/mL, microsomal PGE
synthase (mPGES) (Cayman Chemical) at 1:1000, or
b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo) at 1:2000. The
membranes probed by COX-2, PPAR-g, and mPGES
were incubated for 2 hours with antirabbit immunoglobulin (Ig) G conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
and then immunoblots were visualized using diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Sigma-Aldrich) as a substrate of
peroxidase. b-Actin was used as a loading control.
The membranes probed by b-actin were incubated
for 1 hour with biotinylated antimouse immunoglobin, transferred to avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex
reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif), and
incubated in this solution for 30 minutes. DAB
(Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a substrate. Quantification of the results was performed by scanning the
membrane with Photoshop software (version 5.5;
Adobe Systems, San Jose, Calif) followed by densitometry with the public domain software NIH Image
(version 1.62; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
Md).

Measurement of PGE2 in Serum and Ascites and
Measurement of VEGF in Ascites
PGE2 concentrations were determined with PGE2 EIA
system (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. VEGF concentrations were determined using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems) as
described by Gu et al.33
Immunohistochemical Analysis and Microvessel Density
Six-lm sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were stained by the established method previously described.34 Sections were
incubated with antibodies specific for mPGES or
VEGF (R&D Systems) for 1 hour and CD31 (R&D
Systems) overnight. Slides were incubated with
biotinylated species-specific appropriate secondary
antibodies for 30 minutes and then exposed to avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories).
Sections were treated with 0.02% DAB as a chromogen and counterstained with hematoxylin. VEGF
expression was evaluated according to a scoring
method that uses the positive cell percentage and
the staining intensity as reported previously.29 Microvessel density was determined as follows. The highly
vascularized areas of the tumor stained with an antiCD31 antibody were identified and CD31-positive

794

microvessels were counted under high power in a
field of 0.75 mm2 area (3200 magnification). Single
endothelial cells or clusters of endothelial cells, with
or without a lumen, were considered individual vessels. Microvessel density was expressed as the vessel
number/high-power field in sections. Three fields
were counted per animal and the average was taken
as the microvessel density of each tumor.

Apoptosis
Apoptosis was measured in tissue sections by the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as
described by Gavrieli et al.35 with some modifications. Briefly, 6-lm sections were stripped from proteins by incubation with 10 mg/mL proteinase-K for
15 minutes and immersed in 0.3% H2O2 in methanol
for 15 minutes to block the endogenous peroxidase.
The sections were then incubated in TdT mixture
buffer (200 mM potassium cacodylate, 25 mM TrisHCl [pH 6.5], 0.25 mg/mL BSA, 1 mM CoCl2, 0.01
mM biotin-dUTP, and 520 U/mL TdT) at 378C for 1
hour. After rinsing in PBS the sections were exposed
to avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex at 378C for 30
minutes. Cells undergoing apoptosis were visualized
with DAB. The number of stained tumor cells was
counted in the 3 fields with highest activity under a
high-power field of 0.75 mm2 area (3200 magnification) and the results were averaged.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in tumor volume between the groups
were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Survival curves were calculated by the
Kaplan-Meier method, and the statistical significance
of differences in the cumulative survival curves
between the groups was evaluated by log-rank test.
Other statistical analyses were performed using the
Student t-test, chi-square test, or Fisher exact probability test. A result was deemed significant at P < .05.

RESULTS
Antitumor Effect of Meloxicam and Ciglitazone in

Carcinomatosis Mouse Model
In the cancer-bearing mouse model, at the end of
the experiment, the tumor volumes were 5.29  1.25,
3.32  0.89, 3.64  0.74, 2.99  0.77 cm3 (expressed
as mean  SD) in the control, cisplatin, meloxicam,
and ciglitazone groups, respectively (Fig. 1A). The
Mann-Whitney U test showed that tumor volume
curves at Days 8–21 in the cisplatin, meloxicam, and
ciglitazone groups were significantly lower (P < .0001)

2.5-fold and PPARc expression simultaneously increased approximately 2fold in tumors treated with meloxicam. PPARc expression increased 2.8-fold
but COX-2 expression did not alter in tumors treated with ciglitazone. Densitometric values represent the actin-corrected means of 6 blots. Blots shown

in the cisplatin, meloxicam, and ciglitazone groups,
compared with the control group (Fig. 1C). No significant difference in survival time was observed between
the cisplatin and meloxicam or ciglitazone groups.
Treatment with meloxicam or ciglitazone did not
result in weight reduction or gain and did not cause
any adverse effects.

Altered Expression of COX-2 and PPARc in Tumors
by Meloxicam or Ciglitazone Administration
To examine whether the expression of COX-2 and
PPARc in tumors is altered after meloxicam and ciglitazone treatment, COX-2 and PPARc expression was evaluated by Western blotting. This analysis revealed that
after ciglitazone treatment, PPARc expression increased
2.8-fold, whereas COX-2 expression did not change,
and that after meloxicam treatment COX-2 expression
decreased 2.5-fold and PPARc expression increased
2.2-fold (Fig. 2). There was no significant effect of
cisplatin on COX-2 and PPARc expression (Fig. 2).
Decreased PGE2 Concentration in Serum and Ascites
With Meloxicam or Ciglitazone Administration
The mean concentration of PGE2 in serum was
695  56 pg/mL for the control group, whereas it
was 104  25 pg/mL and 153  28 pg/mL for the
meloxicam and ciglitazone groups, respectively

(Fig. 3, black bars). The concentration of PGE2 in serum decreased significantly in the meloxicam and
ciglitazone groups compared with the control and
cisplatin groups. The mean concentration of PGE2 in
ascites was 708  256 pg/mL and 423  105 pg/mL
for the control and cisplatin groups, respectively,
whereas it was 152  85 pg/mL and 179  82 pg/mL
for the meloxicam and ciglitazone groups, respectively (Fig. 3, white bars). The concentration of PGE2
in ascites was significantly lower in the meloxicam
and ciglitazone groups than in the control and cisplatin groups.

Altered Expression of mPGES in Tumors Treated
With Ciglitazone
To determine whether the expression of mPGES (a
synthase that converts PGH2 to PGE2) alters in
tumors treated with meloxicam or ciglitazone, the
distribution of mPGES in tumors was immunohistochemically evaluated. In the control and meloxicam
groups, mPGES expression was evenly distributed in
the periphery and center of the tumor (Fig. 4A and
4C), whereas its expression was strong in tumor cells
close to the stroma in the cisplatin group (Fig. 4B).
In the ciglitazone group, overall mPGES expression
was decreased and it was faintly expressed only in
tumor cells close to the stroma (Fig. 4D). Western
blot analysis demonstrated that the amount of intratumoral mPGES was much lower in the ciglitazone
group compared with other groups (Fig. 4E).
Induction of Apoptosis and Reduced Microvessel Density

stained by the TUNEL method and the number of
TUNEL-positive cells per 0.75 mm2 was counted in a
high-power field. The incidence of TUNEL-positive
cells (number/mm2) was 12.8  1.3 for the control
group, 11.0  1.8 for the cisplatin group, 28.3  8.1
for the meloxicam group, and 29.7  10.5 for the
ciglitazone group (Fig. 5A). The incidence of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the meloxicam
and ciglitazone groups than in the control and cisplatin groups. We then examined the number of
microvessels identified with CD31 in tumor tissues
using immunostaining. Microvessel density (MVD)
(number/mm2) was 23.3  4.1 for the control group,
22.7  8.0 for the cisplatin group, 8.9  3.2 for the
meloxicam group, and 16.0  4.7 for the ciglitazone
group, showing a significant decrease in the meloxicam and ciglitazone groups as compared with the
control and cisplatin groups (Fig. 5B).

Decreased Expression of VEGF in Tumors and Ascites
With Meloxicam or Ciglitazone
The amount of VEGF in tumor tissues was semiquantified using immunohistochemical staining. The

amount of VEGF was 5.4  0.5 for the control group,
4.3  0.7 for the cisplatin group, 2.8  0.9 for the
meloxicam group, and 2.4  1.3 for the ciglitazone
group (Fig. 5C). The amount of VEGF was significantly lower in the meloxicam and ciglitazone groups
compared with the control and cisplatin groups. The
amount of VEGF in ascites measured by ELISA was
582.3  112.0 pg/mL for the control group, 391.3 
44.8 pg/mL for the cisplatin group, 254.3  41.1
pg/mL for the meloxicam group, and 109.0 
28.1 pg/mL for the ciglitazone group (Fig. 5D). The
values were significantly lower in the meloxicam and
ciglitazone groups than in the control and cisplatin
groups.

DISCUSSION
In this study it emerged that both meloxicam and
ciglitazone suppressed the growth of solid malignant
tumors and peritoneal carcinomatosa derived from
human ovarian cancer cells in conjunction with
reduction of angiogenesis and significant induction
of apoptosis. Their antitumor effect was comparable
to that of cisplatin (Fig. 1). This is the first report

describing the inhibitory effect of a COX-2 inhibitor
and a PPARc ligand on the growth of ovarian cancer.
As shown in Figure 3, meloxicam and ciglitazone
reduced PGE2 production in the serum of subcutaneously xenografted mice and in the malignant ascites. Western blot analysis revealed that meloxicam
not only down-regulated expression of COX-2 but
also up-regulated that of PPARc, whereas ciglitazone
up-regulated that of PPARc without modulating
COX-2 (Fig. 2). Thus, it is suggested that meloxicam
and ciglitazone led to inhibition of PGE2 by COX-2dependent and independent routes, respectively. It
has been shown that PGE2 enhances angiogenesis
through the induction of VEGF36 and represses apoptosis by maintaining Bc1-2 expression.37 Munkarah
et al.38 also reported that in vitro PGE2 treatment stimulated proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and
reduced apoptosis. PGE2 production is involved in
the ability of cancer cells to invade, metastasize, and
grow.39 Moreover, mPGES, which converts COXderived PGH2 to PGE2, plays an important role in

releasing PGE2 from cancer cells40 and its enhanced
expression is important in tumorigenesis. Cells overexpressing both COX-2 and mPGES produced more
PGE2, grew faster, and exhibited more aberrant morphology than those expressing either COX-2 or
mPGES,41 indicating the pivotal role of PGE2 in tumorigenesis. We found in this study that, whereas
meloxicam did not alter expression of mPGES in
OVCAR-3 tumors, ciglitazone treatment reduced its
expression in the tumors (Fig. 4), resulting in a
decrease in the level of PGE2. These results suggest
that meloxicam and ciglitazone elicit their antitumor
effects by suppressing PGE2 production via different
pathways. The PGE2 measured in serum and ascites
might come from circulating monocytes and peritoneal macrophages as well as from cancer cells.
Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in tumor development and progression. PGE2 is a potent inducer of
angiogenesis in vivo and induces expression of
angiogenic regulatory proteins such as VEGF.42
We examined whether meloxicam or ciglitazone

treatment in vivo reduced VEGF levels in the solid
tumors and the malignant ascites as well as MVD in
the solid tumors, and found significantly lower levels
of VEGF in meloxicam- or ciglitazone-treated tumors
and ascites, accompanied by a significant reduction
in MVD compared with the control and cisplatin
groups (Fig. 5). These results suggest that PGE2 plays
a role in mediating angiogenesis in ovarian cancer.
Additional mechanisms are undoubtedly involved in
mediating the angiogenic effects of PGE2 via COX-2dependent or -independent routes, but the present
results suggest that PGE2 affects angiogenesis partly
by enhancing VEGF secretion from tumor cells.
Naruse et al.43 reported that meloxicam markedly
reduced the expression of VEGF in a lung lesion metastatic from osteosarcoma compared with control
tissues. Celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, might suppress
growth of lung and breast tumors due to the potent
antiangiogenic activity it produces by reducing COX2-derived PGE2.28,44 Conversely, PPARc ligands also
play a potent role in modulating angiogenesis. They
not only inhibit VEGF receptor-2 expression but
also act as a blocker of VEGF-receptor signaling.45,46
Keshamouni et al.45 reported that PPARc ligands repress tumor growth by inhibition of angiogenesis via
blocking the production of ELR1CXC chemokines
mediated through antagonizing NF-jB activation.
Sarayba et al.46 also reported that pioglitazone, a
PPARc ligand, significantly decreased the density of
angiogenesis in a VEGF-induced neovascular model.
Taking these results together with ours suggests that
the suppressive effects of meloxicam and ciglitazone
on tumor growth might be due to decreased angiogenesis through inhibited VEGF production in relation to PGE2 reduction. We recently reported that in
ovarian cancer cells transfection of carbonyl reductase, which converts PGE2 to PGF2a, inhibited VEGF
production, resulting in induction of apoptosis and
inhibition of tumor growth.32
In this study both meloxicam and ciglitazone
induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Reduced
production of PGE2 after meloxicam or ciglitazone
treatment may be the mechanism underlying
enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. It has been shown
that PGE2 reduces the basal apoptotic rate by
increasing the level of antiapoptotic proteins such as
Bcl-2.37 Many pathways that mediate the apoptotic
effect of COX-2 inhibitors have been identified in colon cancer cells. Celecoxib may induce apoptosis in
part via a COX-2-dependent pathway that causes
activation of caspase-3 and -9 together with cytochrome c release, and in part a COX-2-independent
pathway such as down-regulation of cyclin A and B1
and up-regulation of p21, Waf1, and Kip1.47 Another

COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, is reported to induce apoptosis through a MEK/ERK pathway.48 Thus, a clear
picture of the exact pathways by which COX-2 inhibitors induce apoptosis has yet to emerge. Conversely, PPARc also plays a crucial role in apoptosis in
a variety of cells. PPARc activation resulted in enhanced apoptosis of some types of malignant cells
such as prostate cancer cells49 and gastric cancer
cells.50 Martelli et al.51 reported that apoptosis was
induced in thyroid carcinoma cells transfected with
PPARc. More recently, Yang and Frucht26 reported
that ciglitazone induced colon cancer cells to undergo apoptosis through the PPARc pathway mediated
by a caspase-independent mechanism. Taken together, the present results suggest that the suppressive effects of meloxicam and ciglitazone on tumor
growth might be related to the induction of apoptosis via PGE2 reduction. Anticancer drugs such as docetaxel induce apoptosis through a mild to moderate
reduction in PGE2 activity.52
In this study, meloxicam suppressed COX-2
expression in OVCAR-3 tumor (Fig. 2). The mechanisms of COX-2 regulation by NSAIDs vary between
NSAIDs and cell types.53 COX-2 regulation by
NSAIDs is via their inhibition of COX activity, whose
endproducts exert a feedback on COX-2 expression.53
In addition, regulation of COX activity is associated
with PPAR activation.54 The possibility may be suggested that decreased expression of COX-2 in tumors
treated with meloxicam is via PPARc activation (Fig. 2).
We conclude that meloxicam and ciglitazone
could be effective agents in human ovarian cancer
and should be clinically tested alone and in combination with other molecular-targeted agents or cytotoxic drugs.
