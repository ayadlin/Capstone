ABSTRACT
Background and Aims: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for
liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To gain a better understanding of
the pathogenesis of HBV infection, this study aimed to investigate the differentially
expressed proteins (DEPs) in liver tissues from patients with chronic hepatitis B
(CHB) infection.
Results: Seventy-one DEPs were identified. Overexpression of multi-drug
resistance protein 1 (MDR1) was validated by RT-qPCR and western blot analyses.
Moreover, its expression was increased at both the mRNA and protein levels in
response to overexpression of HBV large surface protein (LHBs). Furthermore,
screening of transcription factors suggested the possible involvement of hypoxiainducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) in the interaction between LHBs and MDR1. The function
of HIF-1α in the MDR1 activation was confirmed by EMSA and reporter gene analyses.
Materials And Methods: Liver samples from CHB patients and controls without
HBV infection were collected and subjected to isobaric tags for relative and absolute
quantitation (iTRAQ) and mass spectrometric analysis.
Conclusions: These results imply that LHBs, in association with HIF-1α, induces
MDR1 overexpression, which may contribute to the pathogenic changes in CHB
infection.

INTRODUCTION

the pathogenesis of HBV infection is of high priority in
order to facilitate an improved antiviral strategy.
Recently, approaches employed by comparative
proteomic analysis hold promise for performing largescale studies of protein profiles under various disease
conditions. To identify the proteomic profiles of HBV
infection, samples from HepG2.2.15 and HepAD38
cultured cell lines [6, 7], HBV transgenic mice [8], and
blood from HBV-infected patients [9] have been analyzed.
While these results provide important insights into the
interaction between HBV and cellular proteins, they do
not directly reflect the complexities of the interactions
between HBV and HBV-infected hosts. In this regard,
liver specimens obtained from patients with chronic
hepatitis B (CHB) infection offer a unique opportunity to
investigate the cellular molecular mechanisms involved

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the most
common infectious diseases worldwide, and an estimated
788,000 deaths result from HBV-related end-stage liver
disease (such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC)) each year [1, 2], creating a significant
socioeconomic burden to society. Effective antiviral
therapy may slow down the progression of liver injury and
prevent dismal complications, but the currently available
drugs [3] do not produce a sustained viral response in all
treated patients. In addition, significant side effects of
interferon [4] and the development of drug resistance to
nucleoside or nucleotide analogues limit the long-term
treatment course that is required for sustained suppression
of HBV replication [5]. Clearly, a better understanding of

in the pathogenesis of HBV infection. In this study, we
utilized isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation
(iTRAQ) coupled with liquid chromatography and twodimensional tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
analysis, an ultrasensitive and high-throughput proteomic
technology [10], to quantify differentially expressed
proteins (DEPs) unique to CHB infection.

PSMD14, PTBP1, RAB10, RPSA, RPS25, SND1,
SOD1,TUBB4B, MPO, and VTN) identified by MS analysis
were chosen from 71 DEPs for validation. RT-qPCR
was performed to detect their expression in liver tissues
from ten CHB patients and seven controls. As shown in
Figure 3A, the expression changes of their mRNAs were
consistent with the MS analysis findings. In addition, six
proteins (AP1B1, MDR1, OTUB1, PSMD14, SND1, and
FGB) were chosen for further verification using western
blot. This result showed that the expression of the first five
proteins was significantly higher in CHB patients than that in
controls, and the last one showed a marked downregulation
in CHB patient samples (Figure 3B), which were also
consistent with the MS analysis results (all P < 0.05).

RESULTS
Basic characteristics of the participants
A total of 128 individuals were included in this study,
including 102 patients with CHB and 26 controls without
HBV infection. As shown in Supplementary Table S1, the
age of patients with CHB was 37 ± 11.4 years old, and 73.1%
of them were male. In the control group, the mean age was
29 ± 14.1 years old, and 70.6% were male. Fifty-six CHB
patients were HBeAg-positive and 46 were HBeAg-negative;
the median HBV DNA level for all patients with CHB was
5.23 log copies/mL (range, 3.12 to 8.90 log copies/mL).

Differential MDR1 expression in hepatoma cell
lines
To seek an additional indication for a possible link
between MDR1 expression and HBV infection, MDR1
expression in several cell lines with or without HBV
expression were analyzed by RT-qPCR and western
blot. Figure 4A and 4B show that MDR1 expression
was significantly elevated in HepG2.2.1.5 cells at both
the mRNA and protein levels, compared to HepG2 cells.
Parallel results were observed in HepG2 (Figure 4C
and 4D) and Huh 7 (Figure 4E and 4F) cells, after
transfecting with pEcob6 (1.0 µg) plasmid, which
contained two copies of HBV DNA sequences in tandem.
The mRNA and protein levels of MDR1 in HepAD 38
cells (Figure 4G and 4H), when the secretion of HBV
was not blocked (cultured without tetracycline), were
higher than when the secretion of HBV was blocked (with
tetracycline) [11] (all P < 0.05).

iTRAQ identification and quantification of DEPs
To identify the DEPs in the liver samples of patients
with CHB, double 8-plex iTRAQ quantifications were
performed to eliminate the effect of patients’ HBeAg
status, each of which contains liver tissue samples from
seven randomly selected patients with CHB (iTRAQ
1 was performed with liver tissues that were HBeAgpositive CHB, iTRAQ 2 was with liver tissues that were
HBeAg-negative CHB) and seven non-HBV individuals
(Figure 1A). Figure 1B and 1C show the representative
mass spectrometric peaks of MDR1 in iTRAQ 1 and
iTRAQ 2 quantification, respectively. The relative
quantification for each of the seven CHB samples was
referred to its corresponding pooled sample (113 tag) of
seven controls, which were used as an internal reference,
using ratios of 114:113, 115:113, 116:113, 117:113,
118:113, 119:113, and 121:113. This strategy resulted in
the identification of 1486 unique proteins (Supplementary
Table S2), among which 71 (Supplementary Table S3)
displayed the same expression trend (elevated or reduced)
in at least 12 CHB samples (53 upregulated and 18
downregulated proteins). The majority of these proteins
were binding proteins, followed by catalytic and structured
enzymes. They are known for many biological functions,
such as metabolic processes, cellular processes, and
localization (Figure 2).

LHBs overexpression increased the expression
level of MDR1
Previous studies have reported that HBx protein
transactivates the human MDR1 gene [11]. Moreover,
LHBs also has been shown to be a strong transactivator
[12, 13]. We wondered whether LHBs is involved in
elevating MDR1 expression. Therefore, the pCMVtag2B-LS, pCMV-tag2B-MS, pCMV-tag2B-SS, and
pCMV-tag2B-X plasmids were respectively transfected
into the HepG2 and Huh 7 cell lines, in parallel with
control plasmid pCMV-tag2B transfection. As shown
in Figure 5A and 5B, the anti-flag band showed the
success of transfection and represented the corresponding
overexpressed protein in each plasmid. MDR1 expression
was remarkably increased in LHBs- and X proteinoverexpressing cells, compared to the MHBs- and
SHBs-overexpressing cells and the negative control (all
P < 0.05). However, its levels in X protein-overexpressing
cells seemed to be lower than that with LHBsoverexpression. In addition, this induction appeared to

and 5E) and protein (Figure 5D and 5F) levels, independent
of the HepG2 or Huh7 cell line.

MDR1 score in the group with higher LHBs concentrations
(OD values of LHBs ≥ 1) was significantly higher than that
in the group with lower LHBs concentrations (OD values of
LHBs < 1) (47.67 ± 9.927 vs. 11.00 ± 4.249, P = 0.0004).
The regression coefficient of MDR1 and LHBs was 0.76
(Figure 5I, P < 0.0001).

Relationship between serum LHBs and MDR1
expression in liver tissues from CHB patients

Proteomic analysis of transcription factors

To further investigate the association between
LHBs and MDR1, MDR1 was immunohistochemically
stained in liver tissue samples from 70 CHB patients
(Figure 5G), and the paired serum levels of LHBs were
detected by ELISA. As shown in Figure 5H, the average

Next, we characterized changes in the expression of
transcription factors between HepG2 cells transfected with
pCMV-tag2B-LS (1.0 μg) or pCMV-tag2B (1.0 μg) using the

Involvement of HIF-1α in LHBs-mediated
MDR1 induction

TranSignal Protein/DNA Array I. Of the 345 transcription
factors analyzed (Figure 6A, 6B and Supplementary
Table S4), 30 were upregulated and 3 were downregulated
by 5-fold or more in LHBs-overexpressing HepG2 cells
(Figure 6C and Supplementary Table S5). To narrow down
the candidate transcription factors, ten transcriptional factors
(seven ≥ 10-fold, three ≤ 0.2-fold) were selected for further
study (Figure 6A, 6B and Supplementary Table S6).

HIF-1α was significantly elevated at both the mRNA
(Figure 7A) and protein levels (Figure 7B) in the pCMVtag2B-LS-transfected cells, suggesting that LHBs induced
a high expression level of HIF-1α. To further confirm the
effect of LHBs on HIF-1α activation, we performed an
EMSA. As shown in Figure 8A, HIF-1α exhibited ten-fold
higher activity in the LHBs-overexpressing cells than in the
controls. These changes were in line with the array analysis
results. Next, a coreporter gene assay by cotransfecing
HepG2 cells with pCMV-tag2B-LS plasmid and the HRE
reporter (HRE-Luc)/pGL3-MDR1 plasmid were carried out.
Activation of the HRE and pGL3-MDR1 reporter activity
were detected in LHBs-overexpressing cells (Figure 8B
and 8C), which indicating that HIF-1α upregulation
mediated by LHBs was a critical factor for MDR1 gene
overexpression. Then, HepG2 cells were transfected
with pCMV-tag2B-LS and pCMV-tag2B-X plasmid
separately or mixed to explore the relationship between
the overexpression and the induction of MDR1. Figure 8D
shows that the HRE activity was 14-fold and 4-fold higher

transfected with the pCMV-tag2B-LS plasmid, compared
to HepG2 cells transfected with the pCMV-tag2B plasmid.

were similar to those shown by the protein/DNA array.

in LHBs- and X protein-overexpressed cells, respectively.
Similarly, the HRE activity was elevated by 14-fold when
the cells were cotransfected with the two plasmids.

MDR1 expression is preferably expressed in
the liver, and a basic function of MDR1 is to detoxify
hepatocytes through pumping out toxicants to protect
liver cells. HBV infection produces a huge pool of
HBsAg, including LHBs. These HBsAg particles cause
pathological injury to infected cells in both experimental
and clinical settings. One example is that the accumulation
of the pre-S1 protein was observed in the livers of HBV
transgenic mice that expressed the entire large HBsAg
protein, which induced significant liver injury resembling
the pathological changes of hepatitis [15]. Another example
is the observation of ground-glass cells in HBV-infected
livers, which give a distinct abnormal appearance that is
caused by the intracellular accumulation of HBsAg [16].
However, as evidenced by the high level of serum
HBsAg and that the majority of CHB patients do not
have prominent liver injury, we assume that the efficiency
of HBsAg particle secretion is generally sufficient. It is
conceivable that active HBV replication may cause stress in
infected cells that may trigger a cellular response in which

DISCUSSION
In this study, we used the iTRAQ proteomic method
to identify DEPs in the liver tissues from CHB patients
and controls without HBV infection. The expression levels
of 71 proteins were significantly altered between the two
groups. The altered expression levels of APCS, AP1B1,
CFL1, DBI, EIF4B, FGB, HSPB1, MAP4, MDR1,
MPO, NCL, OLA1, PSMD14, PTBP1, RPSA, RPS25,
SND1, and VTN were confirmed by real-time RT-qPCR
and western blot assays. First, we detected a consistent
association between LHBs and an elevated expression of
MDR1 in stably and transiently HBV DNA-transfected
cells and liver tissues from CHB patients. Furthermore, we
uncovered that the LHBs-induced upregulation of MDR1
expression was mediated through HIF-1α [14, 15].

MDR1 expression could be upregulated to deal with a high
intracellular HBsAg concentration. Thus, it seems to us that
the pathological changes generated by the accumulation of
HBsAg could also induce MDR1 expression to respond to
a viral insult. In our view, the elevated expression of MDR1
represents a natural cellular response to HBV infection,
but it may undermine the efficacy of antiviral agents in the
treatment of CHB infection.
Our investigation of transcription factors suggested
the possible involvement of HIF-1α in mediating the

elevation of MDR1 expression initiated by LHBs. The
increased expression of HIF-1α in LHBs-overexpressing
cells was validated by western blot and real-time PCR
assays, and HIF-1α transcriptional activity was confirmed
by EMSA and reporter gene analysis. HIF-1α has been
reported to be a common pathway for the infection of
human oncogenic viruses including HBV [17], suggesting
that HIF-1α regulates the overexpression of MDR1.
As previous studies have reported that HBx protein
transactivates the human MDR1 gene through HIF-1α,

which is thought to be responsible for chemotherapeutic
resistance in HCC [13], we further studied the relationship
of LHBs and X protein expression with this activation.
LHBs appears to be stronger than X protein in activating
HIF-1α.

OTUB1 was another upregulated protein found in
this study. It is a hydrolase that can specifically remove
‘Lys-48’-conjugated ubiquitin from proteins, and it
regulates the level of protein turnover by preventing
degradation [18]. The recruitment of OTUB1 to tumor

necrosis receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), a ubiquitin
ligase required for virus-triggered interferon response
factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation,
inhibited the ubiquitination of HSCARG, a newly reported
negative regulator of NF-κB in viral infection [19]. The
overexpression of  OTUB1 inhibited  virus-induced
activation of IRF3 and NF-κB, whereas knockdown
of OTUB1 had the opposite effects. These findings suggest

that OTUB1 may negatively regulate virus-triggered type
I interferon induction and the cellular antiviral response
by deubiquitinating TRAF3. Further studies are needed
to determine whether OTUB1 exerts a similar function
during HBV infection.
SND1 was also found to be upregulated in this
study. SND1 is related to pathways involved in Epstein–
Barr virus infection [20] and viral carcinogenesis. In

addition, immunohistochemical analysis of 109 HCC
liver samples documented higher SND1 expression in
81 cases (74%), compared to the normal liver, and SND1
expression was gradually increased with the stages and
grades of the disease. Moreover, the overexpression of
SND1 downregulated the tumor suppressor mRNA levels
in HCC cells, while knockdown of SND1 upregulated
them [21]. In the current study, SND1 expression was
higher in the liver tissues of HBV-infected patients, but
the exact impact on the course of HBV infection and
pathogenesis remains to be determined.
In this study, FGB was downregulated in the liver
tissues of CHB patients. This finding was consistent with a
published report, which showed that the level of FGB was
significantly decreased in the plasma of 116 HBV-infected
individuals by western blot analysis, compared with
70 normal subjects [22].
In conclusion, this study presented comparative
proteomic profiles of liver tissues from CHB patients
and individuals without HBV infection. Seventyone differentially expressed proteins that are possibly

associated with HBV infection were identified, and the
correlation between MDR1 and HBV infection was further
probed and confirmed. For the first time, we showed that
wild-type LHBs can transcriptionally elevate MDR1
expression through increasing HIF-1α expression and
activity. Therefore, an increased MDR1 expression in
response to HBV infection may compromise the efficacy
of antiviral agents in the treatment of CHB patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue collection
Patients with CHB were diagnosed according to the
guidelines of the American Association for the Study of
Liver Diseases, the European Association for the Study
of the Liver, and/or the Asian Pacific Association for
the Study of the Liver [23–25]. Controls without HBV
infection were recruited from those who tested negative
for HBV infection but had a liver rupture, cyst, or

biopsy from the CHB patients and through hepatectomy
from controls. All individuals in this study were negative
for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis virus C
infection. All the liver tissues were collected at the Second
Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University
from January 2013 to October 2015. This study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical
University in accordance with the principles stated in the
Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was
obtained from each participant.

Total protein from each liver tissue sample was
extracted using a Sample Grinding Kit (Amersham
Biosciences) that contained lysis buffer (7 M urea,
1 mg/mL DNase I, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysate was
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant
was collected, and then the concentration of the total
protein was determined by using a 2-D Quantification Kit
(Amersham Biosciences). All extraction steps were carried
out at 4°C.
Following the iTRAQ protocol (8-plex, Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), the prepared proteins
(100 μg) for each pool were precipitated, redissolved,
denatured, cysteine blocked, digested, and then labeled
with the iTRAQ tags as follows: seven controls without
HBV infection were pooled and labeled with the 113 tag;
CHB (HBeAg-positive) patients 1 to 7 were labeled with
the iTRAQ tags of 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, and 121,
respectively. In addition, duplicate labeling was performed
to eliminate the effects of the patients’ HBeAg status,

Cell lines and culture conditions
The human HCC cell lines HepAD38, Huh 7, HepG2,
and its derivative HepG2.2.1.5 cells were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All

Eagle’s medium (DMEM, HyClone, Waltham, MA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco,
San Diego, CA), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin at 37.0°C in 5% CO2. In addition, HepAD38
cells were cultured in the presence of 0.3 mg/mL tetracycline
and 400 mg/mL G418 (GIBCO BRL/Life Technologies).

using the prepared proteins from another set of samples
including seven controls without HBV infection and
seven CHB (but HBeAg-negative) patients with the same
order of iTRAQ tags. All labeled samples were selected
randomly from each group.
The prepared peptides were fractionated by
immobilized pH gradient (IPG) isoelectric focusing
[9] as follows: the pre-mixed iTRAQ-labeled peptide
samples were redissolved in 300 μL of 8 M urea and
1% Pharmalyte solution (Amersham Biosciences), and
then rehydrated on an IPG strip (pH 3–10, 18 cm long,
Amersham Biosciences) for 14 h at 30 V. Subsequently,
the peptides were focused for a total of 68 kV·h with
an IPGphor isoelectric focusing system (Amersham
Biosciences). The strips were removed and quickly cut
into 36 pieces of 5-mm fractions with 100 μL of Buffer
A (2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) for 1 h. Then,
these fractions were lyophilized and desalted with a
C-18 Discovery® DSC-18 SPE column (100 mg capacity,
Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich). Thereafter, all these desalted
fractions were lyophilized and stored at −20.0°C prior to
mass spectrometric analysis.

Approximately 30 µg of protein in each lane was
electrophoretically separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred
onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Amersham
Biosciences) for immunoblotting. Membranes were
blocked for 1 h in 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline
with Tween-20 (TBS-T) and incubated with primary
antibodies (1:100–1:1000 dilution) against AP1B1,
CEBPA, FGB, HIF-1α, HNF4A, MDR1, OTUB1,
PSMD14, SND1, STAT5B, flag, and β-actin (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA). After washing three times for
10 min with TBS-T buffer, the membranes were incubated
with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated IgG
antibody (goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit, or rabbit
anti-goat) (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) as
the secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) for 1 h at room
temperature. Finally, membranes were visualized on a
ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Quantification of target proteins was normalized against
β-actin and analyzed by density detection. All of the
western blotting analyses were repeated at least three times.

Mass spectrometry and database search

RNA extraction and quantitative reverse
transcription–polymerase chain reaction
(RT-qPCR)

Mass spectrometry was carried out with a QStar
Elite Hybrid ESI Quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass
spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA),
coupled to the online capillary liquid chromatography
Dionex Ultimate 3000 system (Amsterdam, The
Netherlands) [9]. In detail, purified peptide fractions
were resuspended in 20 μL of Buffer A, half of which
was injected into the liquid chromatography system.
Subsequently, the peptide mixtures were separated by a
C-18 PepMap column (Dionex) using a series of solvent
gradients of 2–100% Buffer B (98% acetonitrile and
0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 μL/min. For data
acquisition, positive ion survey scans were performed
using a selected mass range of 300–1,800 m/z. The two
most abundant charged peptides above 20 counts were
selected for tandem mass spectrometry at a dynamic
exclusion of 30 s with a mass tolerance of ± 50 mDa.
ProteinPilot software v2.0 (Applied Biosystems,
MDS-Sciex) was used to identify and quantify the proteins
using a threshold set at a 5% false discovery rate with 95%
confidence, and then the MS/MS data were searched on
the UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org/) [9, 26].
Protein identification was based on a selection threshold
of ProtScore > 1.3 (1.3/1) or < 0.77 (1/1.3), and at least
three unique peptides with 95% confidence were required
for quantitation. The relative quantification of proteins
was determined on the MS/MS scans using the ratios of
the peak areas of 113–119 Da and 121 Da, respectively.
A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Gibco-BRL,
Gaithersburg, MD), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. First-strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed
from 2 µg of total RNA using an A3500 Reverse
Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI). RTqPCR was performed on an ABI 7300 system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a TaqMan® TAMRA™
PROBE 5′FAMTM Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington,
MA) and gene-specific primers for the selected
genes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which are listed in
Supplementary Table S7.
Relative quantification of gene expression was
calculated with the 2−ΔΔCT method [27]. RT-qPCR
quantification of each of the targeted genes was repeated
at least three times.

Plasmid and transfecion
The plasmid pEcob6 was kindly provided by Tim
Harrison (The Royal Free Hospital, Universtiy of London,
UK), which contained two copies of tandem HBV DNA
sequences. Four amplified fragments (Supplementary
Table S8), following the template of pEcob6, were cloned
into the N-terminal Flag-tagged mammalian expression
vector pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to
construct LHBs (pCMV-Tag2B-LS)-, MHBs (pCMV-

Tag2B-MS)-, SHBs (pCMV-Tag2B-SS)- and X proteinexpressed plasmids (pCMV-Tag2B-X), respectively.
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates one day
before transfection at a density of 5 × 105/well. Then,
the plasmid was transfected into the prepared cells
using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen-Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in the presence of serum-free
medium. The transfected cells were harvested at 48 h posttransfection for further analysis.

IL, USA). In brief, 5 mg of nuclear extract was prepared
identically as in the protein/DNA assay, mixed with 10 µL
of binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl,
1 mM DDT, 1 mg of poly dI–dC, 2.5% glycerol, 5 mM
MgCl2, and 1 mM EDTA), and incubated with or without
1 µL of unlabeled competitor or mutant oligonucleotides
of HIF-1α (5′-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′)
for 10 min at room temperature. Then, the oligonucleotides
of biotin-labeled HIF-1α (5′-TCT GTA CGT GAC CAC
ACT CAC CTC-3′) were added and co-incubated for
another 20 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded
onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel and separated in 0.5 × TBE
at 4°C, followed by transfer to a PVDF membrane. After
crosslinking under ultraviolet light, the membrane was
probed with HRP-conjugated streptavidin solution (Pierce)
at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the membrane
was visualized by using HRP Substrate Working Solution
(Millipore) and imaged with a ChemiDoc MP imaging
system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
IHC evaluation of MDR1 was performed on 70
liver biopsy tissues from patients with CHB. Sections
were paraffin-embedded and baked at 60.0°C and then
were incubated overnight at 4.0°C with antibodies
against MDR1 (1:100 dilution). After incubation with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, the stained
sections were detected with an Envision/HRP system
(Dako-Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), evaluated, and
scored, respectively, by three qualified pathologists who
were blinded to the clinical data. The protein expression
levels of these sections were analyzed by using a semiquantitative scoring method that assessed both staining
intensity (scale: 0–3) and the percentage of positive cells
(0–100%), resulting in a final score ranging from 0 to 300
when multiplied.
The serum LHBs levels of patients whose liver
tissue was analyzed by IHC were measured using an
ELISA kit (Beijing Hotgen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing,
China) [28], with a minimum detection level of 5 ng/mL.
All measurements were carried out in triplicate.

Cotransfection and reporter gene analysis
HepG2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates one
day before transfection at 0.5 × 105 cells/well and then
transiently cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pCMV-tag2B
(blank vector as a negative control)/pCMV-tag2B-LS
and/or pCMV-tag2B-X/pGL3-MDR1 plasmid (Promega,
Madison, WI), 0.5 μg of hypoxia response element (HRE)
reporter plasmid (PGL4.42, Promega, Madison, WI), and
0.15 μg of pRL-SV40 plasmid, which expressed Renilla
luciferase for normalization (Promega). The luciferase
signal was detected and normalized with Renilla luciferase
using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega,
Madison, WI) 2 days after transfection. Each transfection
experiment was repeated at least three times.

Protein/DNA array analysis

Bioinformatics

Proteomic/DNA analyses were performed by
using a TranSignal Protein/DNA Array I (Panomics
Inc., Redwood City, CA). Briefly, nuclear proteins from
samples were extracted, quantified, incubated, and eluted.
Then, the bound probes were hybridized to a membrane
containing an array of 345 transcription factor consensus
binding sequences (Spin Column version, Panomics,
Freemont, CA). After washing, the DNA/protein array was
incubated with a HRP-conjugated streptavidin solution
(Pierce) and visualized by using a HRP Substrate Working
Solution (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The images of the
chemiluminescent signal were captured by a Syngene
GBox Imaging System (Cambridge, UK) and quantitated
with ScanAlyze software.

The Gene Ontology was analyzed by the
Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) Classification
System (http://www.pantherdb.org/) for molecular
functions, biological processes, and protein classes.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were carried out with Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences software, version 20.0
(Chicago, IL). Quantitative variables are presented as
mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (range).
Quantitative differences between groups were analyzed by
the Student’s t-test. Categorical variables were compared
using Pearson’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test, as
appropriate. Pearson’s correlation was used to evaluate
possible associations. P-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant, and all tests for significance were
two-tailed.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
EMSA was performed following the manufacturer’s
protocol with the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid
Detection Module (Pierce, Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford,
