BACKGROUND: Apricoxib, a novel once-daily selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, was investigated in combination
with erlotinib for recurrent stage IIIB/IV nonsmall cell lung cancer to determine the maximum tolerated dose, doselimiting toxicity, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) based on changes in urinary prostaglandin E2 metabolite
(PGE-M). METHODS: Patients received escalating doses of apricoxib (100, 200, and 400 mg/day) in combination
with erlotinib 150 mg/day until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Urinary PGE-M was used to assess biologic activity and inform the optimal biologic dose. RESULTS: Twenty patients were treated (3 at 100 mg; 3 at 200
mg; 14 at 400 mg apricoxib) with a median of 4 cycles (range, 2-14 cycles); 8 patients (40%) received prior EGFRdirected therapies. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Study drug-related adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea, rash, dry skin, anemia, fatigue, and increased serum creatinine; 4 patients had grade 3 drug-related AEs (diarrhea, perforated duodenal ulcer, hypophosphatemia, and deep vein thrombosis). The RP2D was 400 mg/day based
on safety, biologic activity based on decreases in urinary PGE-M, and pharmacokinetics. One patient had a partial
response, and 11 had stable disease. Stable disease was observed in patients who had received prior EGFR inhibitor
therapy but was greater in patients not previously treated with an EGFR inhibitor. Seventeen patients had elevated
urinary PGE-M at baseline, and 14 (70%) had a decrease from baseline, which was associated with disease control.
CONCLUSIONS: Apricoxib plus erlotinib was well tolerated and yielded a 60% disease control rate. A phase II trial is
currently investigating 400 mg/day apricoxib plus 150 mg/day erlotinib in patients selected based on change in uriC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Studies have shown that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) play an im-

portant role in the biology of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC),1,2 and EGFR inhibitors have demonstrated clinical activity, particularly in patients with EGFR mutations.3-6 Overexpression of COX-2 is associated with a poor prognosis in
NSCLC,1,7 and COX-2 inhibitors have demonstrated synergy when combined with EGFR inhibitors in preclinical models.8-10 Inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), can promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
and increase resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in lung cancer.8,11 These studies provide a strong rationale for combining a COX-2 inhibitor with an EGFR TKI for the treatment of NSCLC. The current phase I study investigated the combination of apricoxib plus erlotinib in patients with recurrent or stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

chemotherapy regimen or refused chemotherapy. Prior treatment with an EGFR TKI or ongoing treatment with erlotinib (150 mg/day) at study entry was allowed, but patients
with disease progression at study entry while actively receiving an EGFR inhibitor were excluded. No patient entered
the study on erlotinib. Of the 8 patients with prior erlotinib
or gefitinib treatment, 2 had a partial response, 3 had stable
disease (SD), and 2 had progressive disease as their best
response to prior EGFR TKI therapy. In 1 patient, the previous response to erlotinib was unknown. Patients must have
had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status of 0, 1, or 2 and adequate organ function.
Patients were ineligible if they had received prior
treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor for metastatic NSCLC,
radiation therapy <2 weeks prior to study entry, or chemotherapy, noncytotoxic investigational agents, or highdose corticosteroids within 3 weeks of initiating study
treatment. Patients were excluded if they had a history of
myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac intervention
within 12 months; a history of gastrointestinal bleeding,
ulceration, or perforation; or hypersensitivity to apricoxib,
erlotinib, aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Concurrent use of COX-2 inhibitors or other NSAIDs (within 2 days) or aspirin (within 7
days) of the first dose of study drug, antiplatelet drugs, or
anticoagulants was not permitted. Low-dose aspirin was
not allowed. Use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers
was prohibited during administration of erlotinib. Standard treatments for erlotinib-related rash and diarrhea were
recommended. Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) was
not allowed initially; however, after the occurrence of a
perforated duodenal ulcer in 1 patient in cohort 2, it was
suggested that patients be placed on PPIs after the pharmacokinetics (PK) blood draws for apricoxib and erlotinib
were completed. Repeat PK analysis of erlotinib following
initiation of a PPI was not performed. Solubility of apricoxib is not affected by pH, and therefore absorption would
not be expected to change in the presence of PPIs. The
study was approved by the institutional ethics review
boards, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Patient Selection
Adult (18 years of age) patients with histologically confirmed stage IIIB (pleural effusion) or stage IV NSCLC
that was measurable or evaluable by Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) were eligible. Patients
with central nervous system (CNS) metastases were eligible
if their CNS disease was asymptomatic and stable after radiotherapy for 2 weeks and they did not require corticosteroids for 1 week. Patients must have failed at least 1 prior

Study Design
This was a phase I, multicenter dose-escalation study
designed to determine the recommended phase II dose of
apricoxib (Tragara Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA) in
combination with a fixed dose of erlotinib (Tarceva; OSI
Pharmaceuticals, Melville, NY). This was defined either
by the optimal biologic dose (OBD) or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The OBD was defined as the dose at

Apricoxib is a novel once-daily selective COX-2 inhibitor not yet approved for patient use. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that apricoxib has potent analgesic,
anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects.12,13 In xenograft models of human NSCLC, apricoxib inhibited tumor growth more effectively than celecoxib.12 The
preclinical safety profile of apricoxib is consistent with a
selective COX-2 inhibitor with minimal gastrointestinal
toxicity at exposures demonstrating anti-inflammatory
and antitumor activity.13
Selection of patients based on tumor biology can
identify a subset of patients who are more likely to benefit
from EGFR and COX-2 targeted therapy. This concept
was recently validated in 2 large studies that selected
NSCLC patients to enrich the population for EGFR mutations. These studies demonstrated high response rates and
significant clinical benefit from EGFR TKIs.3,5 Similarly,
the combination of celecoxib plus carboplatin/gemcitabine
significantly improved survival in a subset of patients with
moderate to high COX-2 expression.7 Another promising
biomarker for COX-2 activity is the stable metabolite of
PGE2 (PGE-M).14 Urinary PGE-M correlates with intratumoral PGE2 levels,15 and patients with NSCLC have elevated levels of urinary PGE-M.14,16 More importantly, 2
studies have demonstrated that a decrease in urinary PGEM in response to treatment with celecoxib plus chemotherapy correlated with either an objective tumor response or
improved survival.15,17 These studies suggest that PGE-M
may predict response to COX-2 inhibition and may be a
useful biomarker for patient selection.
The primary objective of the current study was to
determine the recommended phase II dose of apricoxib in
combination with erlotinib (150 mg) as daily oral therapy
for advanced NSCLC. A secondary objective was to
explore the value of selecting patients for a subsequent
phase II study based on changes in urinary PGE-M during
treatment with apricoxib.

which the average urinary PGE-M level was reduced from
baseline by >75% in the first 3 patients in a dosing cohort
(cohorts 1 and 2) or the first 3 patients to exhibit a
decrease in PGE-M (amendment 3) and complete 1 cycle
of study treatment. The MTD was defined as the dose
level below the dose that caused dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT) in 1 of 3 or >1 of 6 patients in a dosing cohort.
Nine additional patients were enrolled at the recommended phase II dose to gather further PK data.
DLT was defined as a treatment-emergent adverse
event (TEAE) during cycle 1 that the investigator considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study
drug, including any of the following: grade 4 neutropenia
lasting at least 5 days; grade 3 febrile neutropenia or grade
4 thrombocytopenia of any duration; or grade 3 or greater
nonhematologic toxicities, including grade 3 or greater diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting despite adequate treatment.
Overall survival was not assessed.
Treatment
Cohorts of 3 patients received escalating doses of apricoxib
daily in a fasting condition during cycle 1 and thereafter
with food in combination with daily oral erlotinib (according to the manufacturersâ€™ recommendations, either 2 hours
after or 1 hour before meals) at a fixed dose of 150 mg, beginning on day 8 of cycle 1. Each cycle was 28 days. The
starting dose of apricoxib was 100 mg/day (administered as
a 100-mg tablet), with escalation to 200 mg/day in cohort
2. Thereafter, the dose-escalation schema was determined
based on an interim PK assessment (day 8, cycle 1) of dosing cohorts 1 and 2 to compare the human PK profile of
the milled apricoxib agent used in this study with the
unmilled agent used in earlier PK studies. Dose escalation to
400 mg/day in cohort 3 was based on the observation that
the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the
concentration time curve (AUC) in cohorts 1 and 2 were
<2 times the Cmax and AUC using the unmilled drug substance. Three to six patients were treated at each dose level
according to a 3 Ã¾ 3 design. Patients were removed from
the study if they had disease progression or intolerable toxicity, if they refused treatment, or at the investigatorâ€™s discretion. Patients could continue to receive study treatment
until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
Assessments
Patients were evaluated at baseline and every 2 cycles
thereafter by computed tomography for tumor response
and disease progression according to RECIST version
1.0.18 Objective responses were to be confirmed at least 4

weeks later, and in the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after
study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks (42 days).
Safety was assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE),
Version 3.0. Urine samples were collected for assessment
of PGE-M levels at baseline, end of cycle 1 (cohorts 1 and
2) or day 15 of cycle 1 (cohort 3Ã¾), day 1 of cycle 2, and
end of study. Where possible, tumor and/or plasma was
collected for determination of EGFR mutation status.
Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetic analysis of apricoxib was performed
using blood drawn on day 1 predose, days 1-3 postdose,
days 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1, and day 1 (predose) of each
subsequent cycle. PK analysis of erlotinib was performed
at steady state on day 1 of cycle 2. PK calculations were
performed using noncompartmental methods (WinNonlin, version 5.0.1, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain
View, CA). Full PK data were collected on all patients.
PGE-M Assay
Urinary PGE-M was quantified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry as previously described.14
The upper limit of normal (ULN) for urinary PGE-M in
men (10.4 ng/mg creatinine [Cr]) and women (6.0 ng/mg
Cr) had been previously established using this assay,14 and
these values were used to define elevated PGE-M among
patients enrolled in the current study.
EGFR Mutation Determination
Genomic DNA was extracted from 0.8-1.5 mL of plasma
using a QIAamp DNA Blood mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA). DNA was eluted in 50 lL of sterile ddH2O and the
concentration and purity measured by a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer.
Scorpion-ARMS for EGFR mutations

Specimens were analyzed for mutations in EGFR
using a DxS EGFR29 mutation test kit (DxS Ltd., Manchester, UK) following the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Each
EGFR test kit is supplied with probes specific for exon 19
deletions, T790M and L858R mutations. Each kit also
contains a control probe specific to a non-polymorphic
site used to assess total DNA content. Five microliters of
template DNA was used in each reaction. All reactions
were performed on an iQ5 Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction detection system (BioRad, Hercules, CA) using
these conditions: 95 C for 10 minutes, 45 cycles of 95 C
for 30 seconds, and 61 C for 60 seconds, with fluorescent

readings (set for FAM and HEX) collected after each
cycle. Data were analyzed using iQ5 Optical System software (version 2.0; (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The cycle
threshold (CT) was defined as the fractional cycle number
at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold, set
above baseline, as determined by the software. For each
probe set, a cutoff deltaCT, defined as the CT of the mutant minus the CT of the control, has been established by
the manufacturer as the point at which a positive signal
could be a result of background fluorescence of the primer
on wild-type DNA.
Statistical Design
Patients who completed at least 1 cycle (both drugs for at
least 21 of 28 days) and had at least 1 subsequent safety follow-up visit were included in the analysis for determining
the OBD and MTD. Patients were deemed not evaluable
and replaced if they failed to complete cycle 1 for reasons
other than toxicity. All patients who completed 2 cycles of
study treatment were considered evaluable for efficacy unless
there was clear evidence of clinical progression prior to completing cycle 2. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize
all safety, efficacy, and apricoxib and erlotinib blood concentration data using SAS statistical software (version 8.01).

RESULTS
Patients
A total of 27 patients signed informed consent and were
screened. Of these, 7 patients never received any study drug
(4 were ineligible, 1 had disease progression, 1 withdrew
consent, 1 was lost to follow-up), and 20 patients were enrolled and treated between October 2007 and January
2009. Baseline patient and disease characteristics for the 20
treated patients are shown in Table 1. Median age was 67.5
years, 65% of patients were female, and 40% of patients
were never smokers. The majority of patients had stage IV
NSCLC, and histopathology was varied. The majority of
patients had received at least 1 systemic chemotherapy regimen, and 8 (40%) patients had received prior EGFR TKI
therapy. Three patients were enrolled into cohort 1 (100
mg apricoxib), 3 into cohort 2 (200 mg), and 14 into
cohort 3 (400 mg). One patient in cohort 2 did not meet
all eligibility criteria because of the time frame of prior treatment with an NSAID but was enrolled by waiver. A dose of
400 mg apricoxib was selected for cohort 3 based on the interim PK and urinary PGE-M analysis of cohorts 1 and 2.
A median of 4 cycles (range 2-14 cycles) of apricoxib
and erlotinib were administered. Nineteen patients discontinued because of disease progression, and 1 patient

discontinued of a study drug-related adverse event (grade
3, perforated duodenal ulcer).
Safety
The most frequently reported TEAEs were rash, diarrhea,
dry skin, fatigue, anemia, anorexia, dyspnea, nausea, abdominal pain, anxiety, increased serum creatinine,
decreased appetite, and dizziness (Table 2). The majority
of TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity, and no grade
3 or 4 rash was reported. Grade 3 or greater TEAEs were
reported in 8 patients (Table 3), and 4 patients developed
grade 3 or greater study drug-related TEAEs (diarrhea, perforated duodenal ulcer, hypophosphatemia, and deep vein
thrombosis). Following occurrence of an ulcer in 1 patient
in cohort 2, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were suggested
for all patients in cohort 3. Eleven patients in cohort 3
received PPIs. All grade 3 or greater TEAEs resolved with
dose delays, no apricoxib dose modifications were required,
and there was no DLT at any dose level.
Four patients in cohort 3 had an increase in serum
creatinine. Three of the 4 patients had a grade 1 increase,
which returned to baseline without any change in drug dose.
One patient had a grade 2 increase (from baseline of 1.36 to
2.0 mg/dL) that decreased to baseline when apricoxib was
held. Apricoxib was restarted at the same dose level with no
further increase in the patientâ€™s serum creatinine.
Three patients had a serious adverse event (SAE).
One patient in cohort 2 had a study drug-related grade 3
perforated duodenal ulcer during cycle 3 and was hospitalized. In addition, 1 patient in cohort 3 had shortness of
breath, pleural effusion, and pneumonia requiring hospitalization during cycle 4; these events were considered
unrelated to the study drug and a result of disease progression. A second patient in cohort 3 had an SAE of disease
progression during cycle 5 that was unrelated to the study
drug. None of these SAEs occurred during cycle 1 and
therefore were not DLTs. There were 3 deaths in the study
or within 28 days of study discontinuation, all a result of
disease progression. No serious cardiac AEs or prolongation of QTc were reported.
Antitumor Activity
One patient had a partial response (PR), and 11 patients
had SD, for a disease control rate of 60% (Table 4). Median time to disease progression was 92 days (95% CI, 52118 days). The PR occurred in a female patient in
cohort 1; the duration of response was 302 days (from
date of confirmed PR to date of progression), and the
patient was progression free for 387 days (from date of

had a decrease from baseline, and 11 patients (55%)
had a >50% decrease from baseline urinary PGE-M,

its target at the doses tested, although there was no
clear dose-response relationship. Three patients had an
increase from baseline PGE-M, and 3 patients had no
change.
Exploratory analyses were conducted to determine if

associated with a favorable response to apricoxib plus

during treatment, 1 had SD.
Apricoxib Pharmacokinetics
Apricoxib is a potent COX-2 inhibitor with an IC50 of
1.5 nM for inhibition of PGE2 production in cells. As
shown in Figure 1, trough plasma levels of apricoxib
remained above 53 ng/mL (the IC50) for 24 hours. The
Cmax and AUC of apricoxib decreased slightly from 100

to 200 mg (likely due to high interpatient variability) but
demonstrated a somewhat dose-proportional increase
from 200 to 400 mg/day (Fig. 1). The 400-mg dose also
provided more sustained exposure over 24 hours compared
with lower doses, and some accumulation of drug was
observed by day 8. The day 1 cycle 2 steady-state AUC of
apricoxib in combination with erlotinib was similar to the
single-agent AUC shown in Figure 1 (day 1 of cycle 1).
EGFR Mutation Analysis
Three patients (15%) had EGFR mutations detected, and
none of these patients had received previous anti-EGFR
TKI therapy. Patient 005-006, a 77-year-old woman, had
an exon 21 mutation; patient 005-021, a 73-year-old
woman, had an exon 19 mutation; and patient 001-026, a
42-year-old woman, had an exon 21 mutation. Patients
005-006 and 005-021 had SD for 8 and 3 cycles, respectively, and patient 001-026 progressed at the first tumor
evaluation after cycle 2. No correlation between response
and mutation status can be drawn because of the small
number of mutations and the finding that the experimental kit used could not detect the T790M mutation because
of issues with the probe sensitivity.
Determination of the Recommended
Phase II Dose
No DLT occurred. Therefore, the recommended phase II
dose was determined by the observed biologic activity of

apricoxib based on changes from baseline urinary PGE-M
levels and the observed PK profile. Although the protocol
definition of the OBD (average decrease from baseline
PGE-M >75%) was not achieved in any dosing cohort,
there was a trend toward greater decreases in PGE-M in
individual patients in cohort 3 compared with cohort 2. Further dose escalation of apricoxib beyond 400 mg was not
undertaken because there was no clear increase in biologic
activity compared with 200 mg and because of the drugrelated SAE that occurred in cohort 2. Given that the 400mg dose resulted in an increase in systemic exposure and
maintained plasma levels above the threshold for COX-2 inhibition for a full 24 hours without resulting in any DLT,
400 mg was selected as the recommended phase II dose.

DISCUSSION
The combination of apricoxib and erlotinib was well tolerated. Overall, there was a slight increase in the incidence
and severity of TEAEs with increasing doses of apricoxib,
but no DLT was observed at the highest apricoxib dose
tested. The most frequently observed study drug-related
TEAEs (skin and gastrointestinal events) were consistent
with the known safety profile of EGFR inhibitors, and the
duodenal perforation and increased serum creatinine are
consistent with the safety profile of COX-2 inhibitors. After 1 patient in cohort 2 developed a perforated ulcer,
PPIs were suggested for all patients in cohort 3. This

occurred before the erlotinib prescribing information was
updated regarding coadministration of erlotinib and PPIs,
and future studies will address this issue. An increase in
gastrointestinal bleeding was reported previously with the
combination of a COX-2 inhibitor and erlotinib;19 however, that study allowed low-dose aspirin and anticoagulant therapy. Based on the favorable safety profile,
biologic activity, and PK profile of apricoxib, the recommended phase II dose of apricoxib was determined to be
400 mg/day in combination with 150 mg/day erlotinib.
A secondary objective of this study was to explore
selection of patients for the subsequent phase II study
based on the biomarker urinary PGE-M. In the absence of
patient selection, COX-2 and EGFR inhibitors have
demonstrated only modest antitumor activity in NSCLC.
Several single-arm phase II studies investigating combinations of COX-2 inhibitors with standard chemotherapy in
unselected NSCLC patients failed to demonstrate additive
benefit.7,15,17,20,21 Similarly, several single-arm phase II studies that combined gefitinib with either celecoxib or rofecoxib
demonstrated response rates similar to single-agent gefitinib.22-24 Therefore, patient selection is critical. In the case of
EGFR inhibitors, selection of patients with EGFR mutations has recently been shown to yield high response rates
and improved surival,3,5 whereas EFGR TKIs yield response
rates of only 10% to 15% in unselected populations. At initiation of the current study, there was insufficient data on

PGE-M to support its use as a method for selection. Urinary
PGE-M has been developed as a marker for evaluation of
COX-2 inhibition and has only been tested in the setting of
COX-2 inhibitors or other NSAIDS. Although a decrease in
urinary PGE-M in response to treatment with celecoxib plus
chemotherapy has been shown to correlate with objective tumor response and improved survival,15,17 we sought further
evidence to establish whether either baseline PGE-M or a
decrease in response to treatment with apricoxib could be
useful biomarkers for patient selection.

Exploratory analyses evaluating correlations between
PGE-M and disease control suggested that baseline PGE-M
may be a useful biomarker for patient selection, although
no firm conclusions can be drawn from that analysis.
Nevertheless, patients with elevated baseline PGE-M and
those who subsequently had a decrease from baseline
PGE-M during treatment appeared to have numerically
better disease control. However, it must be noted that
only 3 patients had normal baseline PGE-M at study
entry. Patients with no prior EGFR therapy also appeared
to benefit slightly more than those who had received prior
EGFR therapy. Finally, no conclusions can be drawn
regarding the subset of patients with an EFGR mutation.
Although 3 patients (15%) were found to have an EGFR
mutation using a plasma-based commercial assay, no correlation between response and EGFR mutational status
could be drawn because of the small sample size.
In summary, this phase I study demonstrated that
apricoxib could be safely administered in combination
with erlotinib to patients with advanced NSCLC. This
combination may overcome resistance and improve
response to erlotinib.11,25 A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study is currently ongoing to test the hypothesis that patients selected for treatment based on a
50% decrease from baseline PGE-M after a 5-day openlabel run-in of apricoxib will benefit from treatment with
daily apricoxib (400 mg) plus erlotinib (150 mg).
