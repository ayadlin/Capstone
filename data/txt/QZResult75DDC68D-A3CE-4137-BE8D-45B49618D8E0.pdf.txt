BACKGROUND: Advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS) is an incurable disease. A significant percentage of cases of ULMS express
estrogen and/or progesterone receptors (ER and/or PR). To the authors’ knowledge, the role of estrogen suppression in disease management is not known. METHODS: The authors performed a single-arm phase 2 study of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole at a dose
of 2.5 mg daily in patients with unresectable ULMS with ER and/or PR expression confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Tumor assessments were performed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Toxicity was monitored throughout treatment.
The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival at 12 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients was accrued, with a median of 2
prior treatment regimens (range, 0-9 treatment regimens). The median duration of protocol treatment was 2.2 months (range, 0.4
months-9.9 months). The 12-week progression-free survival rate was 50% (90% confidence interval, 30%-67%). The best response was
stable disease in 14 patients (54%; 90% CI, 36%-71%). Three patients, all of whom had tumors expressing ER and PR in > 90% of tumor
cells, continued to receive letrozole for > 24 weeks. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression
(85%). Letrozole was found to be well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Letrozole met protocol-defined criteria as an agent with activity in
patients with advanced ULMS. Patients with the longest progression-free survival rate were those whose tumors strongly and difC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS) is an uncommon disease, accounting for approximately 2% of all invasive uterine cancers.1 Although a small minority of patients with limited metastatic disease may experience prolonged disease-free survival
after surgical metastasectomy, the vast majority of patients with metastatic ULMS will eventually die of their disease. Systemic therapies, including cytotoxic chemotherapies such as the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel, doxorubicinbased regimens, and trabectedin, have all demonstrated benefit, but to the best of our knowledge none consistently led to
long-term disease control in the majority of patients.2-6 Similarly, pazopanib, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor, has been
approved for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma, including LMS of any site; however, the median progressionfree survival (PFS) is approximately 4.6 months in all soft tissue sarcomas.7 Novel approaches to treatment are therefore
needed.
In pathologic analysis of ULMS, estrogen receptors (ERs) and/or progesterone receptors (PRs) have been reported to
be expressed in 40% to 80% of cases.8-11 The biologic relevance of this expression as related to the underlying oncogenic
mechanisms that lead to the initiation and maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype in ULMS is unknown. Aromatase
inhibitors are a well-tolerated class of hormone-modulating agents approved for the management of postmenopausal
women with breast cancer in the adjuvant and metastatic settings.12-14 Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of
the aromatase enzyme system, blocking the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens by competitively inhibiting

the aromatase enzyme, binding to the heme of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues.
Anecdotal reports and a small retrospective series
have reported mixed activity of aromatase inhibitors in
patients with ULMS, although the extent and degree of
ER/PR expression has not been reported consistently.15-17
Despite these limited data, aromatase inhibitors are frequently used in the management of women with advanced
ULMS. In the current study, we report the results of what
to our knowledge is the first prospective clinical trial of an
aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, in postmenopausal women
with advanced ER-positive and/or PR-positive ULMS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Participants

The current study was a dual-institution, open-label,
single-arm phase 2 clinical trial. Eligible patients were
postmenopausal women with histologically or cytologically confirmed, ER-positive and/or PR-positive advanced
(metastatic and/or unresectable) leiomyosarcoma of uterine origin. ER and/or PR positivity was confirmed on either primary or metastatic tumor tissue. Patients must
have had measurable disease outside of a radiation field as
per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
(RECIST; version 1.0), a life expectancy > 3 months, and
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of  2. Patients may have received any
number of prior regimens of chemotherapy for the treatment of ULMS. Patients who previously received prior
hormonal therapy for the treatment of ULMS were
excluded. In addition, all patients were required to have
adequate renal, hepatic, and hematologic function.
All patients provided written informed consent
before enrollment on the trial and the study protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both
institutions.
Procedures

Eligible patients were treated on an outpatient basis.
Patients received letrozole at a dose of 2.5 mg orally by
continuous once-daily administration.
Tumor assessments according to RECIST (version
1.0) were performed by computed tomography/magnetic
resonance imaging at baseline, week 6, week 12, and then
every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients remained on protocol
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, which
every occurred first. Adverse events were monitored and
recorded throughout the study according to the National
Cancer

March 1, 2014

Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (version 3.0).
Pathologic Analysis

All cases were reviewed by a dedicated gynecologic or soft
tissue pathologist at the participating institutions (DanaFarber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women’s Hospital
Cancer Center or Massachusetts General Hospital) to
confirm the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. ER/PR expression was determined by the diagnostic pathologist as per
institutional standard immunohistochemical staining and
may have been performed either at the participating center (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women’s
Hospital Cancer Center or Massachusetts General Hospital) or at the hospital that rendered the initial diagnosis of
ULMS. Reported expression of ER and/or PR was
required for inclusion. When available, tumor tissue was
reviewed for the extent of ER/PR expression as reported
by the percentage of lesional material expressing each
marker as determined by a single pathologist (M.N.).
Cases were considered to have positive expression of
ER and/or PR if any staining of tumor cells was identified.
If positive, then the percentage of positive nuclei was
recorded.
Statistical Analysis

The primary objectives of the current study were to evaluate the clinical activity of letrozole in postmenopausal
women with advanced ER-positive and/or PR-positive
ULMS and to evaluate the safety of letrozole in this
patient population.
The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival (PFS) rate, defined as the percentage of patients who
were free of objective disease progression (as per RECIST
version 1.0) at 12 weeks. The study was designed to distinguish a favorable true PFS rate of 40% from a null rate
of 20% using a conventional 2-step phase 2 study design
model. The 40% PFS rate was chosen based on European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria.18 If at least 4 of the first 17 patients enrolled were free
of disease progression at 12 weeks, an additional 20
patients would be enrolled, for a total accrual goal of 37
patients. If  11 patients among 37 eligible patients were
free of disease progression at 12 weeks, letrozole was to be
considered effective and worthy of further study in
patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma. This statistical
model provided 10% type I error and 90% power. There
was a 54.9% probability of stopping early if the drug was
ineffective, a 9.5% probability of rejecting the treatment
if it was effective (true rate of 40%), and a 90.3%

using the Kaplan-Meier method, with 90% confidence
intervals (90%CI) calculated using the Greenwood formula. The associations between PR, ER, ECOG performance status, body mass index, mitotic rate, and PFS were
explored using Cox regression models.
RESULTS
Enrollment

A total of 19 eligible patients were enrolled in the first
stage between March 4, 2009 and February 4, 2010, 17 of
whom received at least 1 dose of letrozole. Two patients
were deemed to be ineligible after enrollment and before
receiving first dose of study drug. After 7 patients were
observed to be free of disease progression at 12 weeks, an
additional 9 patients were accrued, for a total of 28
patients enrolled and 26 treated patients. The study was
closed due to a decline in accrual and the concurrent observation of at least 11 patients being free of disease progression at 12 weeks, which was the protocol criterion for
efficacy.
Patient and Tumor Characteristics

Table 1 summarizes patient characteristics at the time of
study entry for all 26 eligible and treated patients. The
median age at study entry was 56 years (range, 44 years-74

postmenopausal (77%), with an ECOG performance status of 0 (65%). All patients had histologically confirmed
LMS of the uterus. Before study enrollment, patients had
received a median of 2 previous chemotherapeutic regimens (range, 0 regimens-9 regimens). Tumor characteris740

and 22 cases expressed both ER and PR.
Treatment and Best Response

The median duration of letrozole treatment for the entire
cohort was 10 weeks (range, 2 weeks-45 weeks). Best
response was stable disease in 14 patients (54%; 90% CI,
36%-71%). The 12-week PFS rate was 46% (90% CI,
29%-64%). This CI excluded the null rate of 20%. The
median duration of treatment was 2.2 months. The most
common reason for treatment discontinuation was disease
progression, which ultimately occurred in 22 of 26
patients (85%)

patients (12%) experienced grade 3 adverse events. One
patient died of progressive disease within 30 days of treatment and another patient developed colon cancer and was
removed from the study.
Progression-Free Survival

Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier PFS curve. The median
PFS was 12 weeks (90% CI, 6.6 weeks-13.6 weeks). The
actuarial 12-week PFS rate was 50% (90% CI, 30%67%) and the actuarial 24-week PFS rate was 17% (90%
CI, 4%-37%). Three patients were free of disease progression after 24 weeks on study. The tumor characteristics of
these cases are summarized in Table 4. Two of the 3
patients who remained free of disease progression at 24
weeks received letrozole as first-line systemic therapy. The
third patient had received 3 prior therapies (doxorubicin
in combination with ifosfamide, single-agent ifosfamide,
and gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel), with
treatment durations ranging from 1 month to 8 months.
In addition, 2 of the patients in this cohort had demonCancer

strated disease progression within the 3 months before
study enrollment.
There was no statistically significant relationship
noted between the mitotic rate and PFS (P 5 .65 using
the Cox regression model with the mitotic rate as a continuous variable, and log-rank P values of .46 and .74,
respectively, using a cutoff value of 20 or 10).
However, there was a significant association noted
between higher ER status, using a cutoff of 90% to divide
patients into 2 groups, and prolonged PFS (log-rank
P 5 .04). There was also a significant relationship noted
between PR status, similarly using a cutoff of 90%, and
PFS (log-rank P 5 .01). Although there was a trend toward improved PFS noted when using lower cutoffs of
50% and 80%, respectively, for ER and PR expression,
this difference was not statistically significant in this small
cohort. There was no significant relationship noted
between ECOG performance status, body mass index
(using a cutoff at the median of 32), or menopausal status
and PFS (log-rank P > .05).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first
prospective phase 2 trial of an aromatase inhibitor in
patients with metastatic ULMS. ULMs is the most common mesenchymal malignancy of the uterus. Despite
complete resection of disease localized to the uterus,
metastases occur in approximately 50% of patients within
3 years.19
Although systemic therapies can lead to disease
control in a subset of patients, the duration of benefit may
be limited, and cure is typically not possible. Therefore,
addition therapeutic options that balance disease control
with toxicity are needed. The progression free survival at
12 weeks (PFS12) is sufficient to justify this regimen as a
relatively nontoxic control arm for further studies and
there has been discussion within the National Cancer
Institute Gynecologic Cancer Steering Committee of
using this regimen as a treatment arm in adjuvant studies.
The characteristics of ULMS can vary widely, both
with regard to pathologic features and natural history.
Approximately 40% to 80% of ULMS express some
degree of ER and/or PR positivity. However, to the best
of our knowledge, the precise role of hormonal receptors
in the disease biology of ULMS remains unclear. One
single-institution retrospective study suggested that the
expression of ER and/or PR in LMS confined to the
uterus was associated with superior outcomes when
compared with cases that did not express ER/PR.11
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the
741

Original Article

first prospective evaluation of aromatase inhibition in
patients with ULMS expressing ER and/or PR by immunohistochemistry. It is interesting to note that our overall
patient population had a median PFS of 12 weeks; however, the 3 patients whose tumors demonstrated > 90%
expression of both ER and PR had significantly longer disease control in the current study: > 24 weeks. In addition,
2 of 3 of these patients had high mitotic rates (30 mitoses
and 40 mitoses per 10 high-power fields, respectively),
suggesting that traditional features that may be related to
more aggressive behavior may not apply to tumors that
retain high expression of ER and PR.
Two of the 3 patients in this latter group experienced clear disease progression within the 3 months
before study enrollment, suggesting that a subset of
ULMS may indeed be reliant on pathways related to ER/
PR and that suppression of estrogen may impact disease
progression in this subset of patients.
Previous reports evaluating the role of hormone suppression in patients with ULMS are primarily retrospective anecdotal case reports that have described unique
patients who experience disease control while receiving
aromatase inihibitors.15-20 These reports were limited by
the highly selective nature of case reports and often lacked
detailed additional pathologic details regarding tumor
characteristics, such as mitotic rate or degree of ER/PR
expression.
A retrospective series of aromatase inhibition in 40
patients with advanced ULMS reported an objective
response rate of 9%.17 All patients who achieved response
had tumors that expressed ER, which was defined as ER
staining in > 10% of tumor cells. Further detail on the
degree of ER expression or the mitotic rate was not
described.
Letrozole met our protocol definition as a potentially active agent in patients with advanced ULMS that
expresses ER and/or PR. The European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria of a PFS rate
of 40% at 12 weeks is based on second-line therapy in
patients with soft tissue sarcoma. It is interesting to note
that the median number of prior therapies in the current
study cohort was 2, suggesting that this population was
more heavily pretreated, although 2 of the 3 patients with
longer disease control received letrozole as first-line therapy. The current study data also suggest that the potential
benefit is somewhat limited in an unselected cohort of
patients with ER-positive/PR-positive metastatic ULMS.
We did observe a nonstatistically significant trend toward
longer PFS in patients with tumors that more strongly
expressed ER/PR, which may be related to the underlying
742

more favorable biology of these tumors. However, in
patients with very high expression of both ER and PR,
defined as > 90% of tumor cells, there was significantly
longer PFS, including among patients with active disease
progression at the time of study entry, suggesting that aromatase inhibition may play a role in disease control in this
highly selected population of patients with advanced
ULMS that strongly expresses ER and PR.
