Therapeutic PD-1 Pathway Blockade Augments with Other
Modalities of Immunotherapy T-Cell Function to Prevent
Immune Decline in Ovarian Cancer
Jaikumar Duraiswamy1, Gordon J. Freeman2, and George Coukos1,3

Abstract
The tumor microenvironment mediates induction of the immunosuppressive programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)
pathway, and targeted interventions against this pathway can help restore antitumor immunity. To gain insight
into these responses, we studied the interaction between PD-1 expressed on T cells and its ligands (PD-1:PD-L1,
PD-1:PD-L2, and PD-L1:B7.1), expressed on other cells in the tumor microenvironment, using a syngeneic
orthotopic mouse model of epithelial ovarian cancer (ID8). Exhaustion of tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL)
correlated with expression of PD-1 ligands by tumor cells and tumor-derived myeloid cells, including tumorassociated macrophages (TAM), dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). When combined
with GVAX or FVAX vaccination (consisting of irradiated ID8 cells expressing granulocyte macrophage colony—
stimulating factor or FLT3 ligand) and costimulation by agonistic a-4-1BB or TLR 9 ligand, antibody-mediated
blockade of PD-1 or PD-L1 triggered rejection of ID8 tumors in 75% of tumor-bearing mice. This therapeutic
effect was associated with increased proliferation and function of tumor antigen-speciﬁc effector CD8þ T cells,
inhibition of suppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and MDSC, upregulation of effector T-cell signaling molecules,
and generation of T memory precursor cells. Overall, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade enhanced the amplitude of tumor
immunity by reprogramming suppressive and stimulatory signals that yielded more powerful cancer control.

Introduction
At the time of diagnosis, more than 75% of patients with
ovarian cancer present with advanced stage III or IV disease
(1, 2). Despite appropriate surgery and receiving highly effective ﬁrst-line chemotherapy, approximately 70% of patients
with advanced-stage disease who achieve remission eventually
relapse (1, 2). Thus, there is an immediate need for therapeutic
targets for treating ovarian cancer (3). Our group and others
have reported that tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with
antitumor potential exist in patients with cancer (4–7). Studies
in a primary coculture system showed that TILs from many
patients with ovarian cancer secrete low to intermediate levels
of IFN-g and have limited proliferation in response to cognate
peptides (unpublished observation). The programmed cell

death-1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory surface receptor expressed by
T cells, B cells, natural killer T cells, monocytes, and dendritic
cells (DC), but not by resting T cells. PD-1 binds two ligands,
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2 called B7H1 and B7-DC, respectively (8, 9). Tumors can use the PD-1
inhibitory pathway to silence the immune system (8). The
expression of PD-L1 in tumors is inversely correlated with
survival of patients (10, 11). This indicates that, although
antitumor immunity is elicited against ovarian cancer, it is
counterbalanced by immunosuppressive factors.
In ovarian tumors, myeloid cells are one of the major
determinants of immune suppression. These include tumorassociated macrophages (TAM), immature/tolerogenic dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC;
refs. 12–21). In addition, CD4þCD25þFoxp3þ regulatory T cells
(Treg) play a critical role in the control of antitumor immune
responses, relying on PD-1, PD-L1, or CTL-associated antigen 4
(CTLA-4) to carry out these functions (22–27). Most studies
describe mechanisms for the accumulation of these immunosuppresive myeloid cells or Tregs. In this study, we show a
cross-regulation among these cell types using the ID8 syngeneic mouse model of epithelial ovarian cancer. We provide
evidence that T-cell dysfunction can be reversed by targeting
the PD-1 pathway simultaneously in all these cell types. We
found that expansion of ovarian antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ TILs
was dependent on the amount of PD-L1 signaling by tumor
cells, tumor-derived myeloid cells, and Tregs. Furthermore,
combining PD-1 blockade with a single dose of GVAX or FVAX

vaccination resulted in enhanced clonal expansion of antigenspeciﬁc CD8þ T cells and tumor control. Finally, we observed a
further boost of CD8þ T-cell function when PD-L1 blockade
was combined with both vaccination and a-4-1BB costimulation. Overall, our study shows that a-PD-L1 blockade therapy
greatly synergizes with other immunotherapy modalities.

Blocking and agonistic antibodies
Rat anti-mouse PD-1 (29F.1A12, at IgG2a, k), PD-L1 (10F.9G2,
rat IgG2b, k), PD-L2 [3.2, mouse immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)],
and isotype control antibodies were used (7). In addition, the
rat anti-mouse 4-1BB antibody from BioXcell was used.

Materials and Methods

Tumor experiments
C57BL6 mice (n ¼ 12) were given an intraperitoneal injection containing 5  106 ID8 cells. Two hundred micrograms of
rat a-mouse-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -PD-L2 antibodies as well as
100 mg of a-CTLA-4 (clone 9D9) or isotype control antibodies
were administered intraperitoneally, 4 weeks after tumor
inoculation ﬁve times on alternate days. For costimulation,
200 mg of a-4-1BB antibody (BioXcell) was given once together

Mice and tumor lines
All experiments were carried out using protocols approved
by the University of Pennsylvania Laboratory Animal
Resources policies. A mouse ovarian epithelial papillary serous
adenocarcinoma cell line (ID8) was obtained from Dr. K.F.

vaccination experiments, 106 irradiated (150 Gy) gene-modiﬁed ID8-GVAX or ID8-FVAX cells were given by intraperitoneally once, 3 weeks after tumor inoculation. Mice were

and are, thus, considered intrinsically nonimmunogenic, mimicking many human ovarian cancers lacking TILs (6). In this
orthotopic model of ovarian cancer, gross metastatic intraperitoneal nodules appear at approximately 28 days, and
tumor and ascites rapidly accumulate, leading to death at
55 to 60 days (Fig. 1A. We investigated the changes in the
frequency of TILs in ovarian tumors, ascites, and spleens of
mice from early (28 days) to late times of tumor growth (52
days). Interestingly, CD3þ (CD8þ and CD4þ) T cells inﬁltrating
during the early tumors were almost completely absent in
advanced tumors (Fig. 1B).
Interestingly, a high percentage of T cells in advanced
tumors were Tregs (31), whereas there were no detectable
CD8þ T cells left and the depletion of T cells was restricted to

PD-1 Blockade Restores Immune Function in Ovarian Cancer

tumors. Parallel to the observed disappearance of CD3þ TILs
and the increase in Tregs, we found a signiﬁcant increase in
MDSCs (CD11bþGr-1þ; P ¼ 0.024; Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig.
S1) and TAMs (CD11bþF4/80þ, P ¼ 0.048) in tumors, but no
signiﬁcant changes in CD11chi dendritic cells (P ¼ 0.10; data
not shown). Thus, lack of immunogenicity in established ID8
tumors seems to be acquired rather than intrinsic.
PD-1 ligands are present in the microenvironment of
ovarian tumors
Previous immunohistochemical studies have reported upregulation of PD-L1 in human ovarian cancers (10). Here, we
observed high levels of PD-L1 and moderate levels of PD-L2 on
ID8 tumor cells, as well as macrophages, dendritic cells, and
MDSCs derived from the same tumors (Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Similarly, myeloid cells derived from ascites
showed moderate expression of high levels of PD-L1 and PDL2; however, spleens showed low-level expression of only PDL1, but not PD-L2. Next, we found that PD-1 was expressed by
matched CD8þ T cells in tumor at both early and later stages
(Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. 2B), but PD-1 expression was not
detected in other organs except PD-1dim CD8þ T cells in the
liver at early stages of tumor. Thus, T cells speciﬁcally upregulate PD-1 in the tumor microenvironment where they are
likely to receive inhibitory signals.
PD-1 or PD-L1, but not PD-L2, blockade therapy causes
regression of ovarian tumors
We next tested whether the blockade of PD-1 could reverse
the decline of T-cell immunity and promote tumor rejection in
mice. In addition, we sought to compare the relative contribution of PD-L1 versus PD-L2. We inoculated C57BL/6 mice
intraperitoneally with ID8 tumor cells and then administered
a-PD-1, a-PD-L1, or a-PD-L2 antibodies starting on day 28
(Fig. 3A, left). Treatment with a-PD-1 or a-PD-L1 antibodies

PD-1 or PD-L1, but not PD-L2, blockade therapy prevents
immune decline in the tumor microenvironment
Next, we tested whether PD-1 blockade was associated with
reversal of immune decline in tumors and enhanced TIL
inﬁltration. We selected the more advanced treatment schedule (starting on day 28), as earlier. A week after completion of
the treatment (day 45), residual peritoneal tumor deposits
were resected and analyzed. The frequency of CD8þ and CD4þ
T cells (as well as total CD45þ leukocytes) was markedly
increased following the administration of a-PD-1 and a-PDL1. Interestingly, despite the lack of tumor response, there was
an increase in CD8þ and total CD45þ cells following a-PD-L2
(Fig. 4A). Importantly, PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade signiﬁcantly
reduced Tregs and, thereby, increased the CD8þ to Treg and
CD4þ to Treg ratios within the tumor (Fig. 4B). In contrast, no
such decrease in Tregs was seen after a-PD-L2 treatment and,
thus, there was no signiﬁcant change in the CD8þ or CD4þ to
Treg ratios.
In addition, we noticed PD-L1 surface expression on Tregs
(Supplementary Fig. S1). To understand whether PD-1–PD-L1
interactions contribute directly to the inhibitory function of
tumor Tregs, CD4þCD25þ Tregs isolated from ID8 tumors
were incubated with responder spleen CD8þ T cells stimulated

resulted in tumor rejection in 25% (3 of 12) of the mice, as
indicated by normalized mouse weights after treatment
(weight gain is due to ascites and is an accurate surrogate of
tumor growth in this model), and long-term survival. On the
contrary, a-PD-L2 antibody did not reject tumors. To test
whether PD-1–mediated TIL suppression was active at even
earlier stages of tumor development, we treated mice with
a-PD-L1, starting on day 21. PD-L1 blockade resulted in
tumor rejection in 60% (7 of 12) of the mice (Fig. 3A, right).
Thus, the PD-1 pathway is highly relevant, and is active very
early in the process of establishment of ovarian tumors.

Thus, PD-L1 blockade not only reduced the relative frequency
of Tregs in ID8 tumors, but also attenuated the suppressive
function of tumor-derived Tregs.
In addition, MDSCs were decreased speciﬁcally by PD-L1
blockade, which thereby increased the ratio of T cells to
MDSCs within the tumor (Fig. 4D). MDSCs suppress effector

T cells through the production of arginase-I (32, 33). Interestingly, we detected a signiﬁcantly lower number of arginase-I–
positive MDSCs in ID8 tumors after treatment with a-PD-L1
(Fig. 4E). To assess whether arginase-I is involved in the
mechanisms through which PD-L1þ MDSCs suppress TILs in
ID8 tumors, CD11bþ Gr1þ isolated from ID8 tumors were
further cultured with ID8 tumor cell supernatants in the
presence or absence of a-PD-L1 antibody. Arginase catalyzes
the conversion of arginine to ornithine and urea in the urea
cycle. Arginase activity was evaluated by measuring the urea
concentration in the media. We found that PD-L1 blockade
decreased the level and activity of arginase-I (Fig. 4F; P ¼

PD-1 Blockade Restores Immune Function in Ovarian Cancer

0.0003). Thus, PD-L1 blockade not only reduced the relative
frequency of CD11bþ Gr1þ cells, but also reduced their suppressive phenotype by reducing arginase-I activity, which
seems to be dependent, in part, on PD-1–PD-L1 interactions.
The earlier data indicate that PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade
signiﬁcantly attenuated the number and function of Tregs
and/or MDSCs. We, thus, tested whether the earlier changes
were associated with activation of CD8þ TILs. We detected
signiﬁcant upregulation of Ki67 and intracellular granzyme B,
as well increased levels of phosphorylated transcription factors, T-bet, Eomes and S6 kinase, and Akt, supporting the
theory that effective PD-1 blockade activated function and
survival pathways in CD8þ TILs (Fig. 4G; Supplementary Fig.
S4; refs. 34, 35).
Vaccination synergizes with PD-1 blockade to prevent
immune decline in tumors
We theorized that vaccine administered in combination
with PD-1 blockade could enhance the efﬁcacy of PD-1 blockade in preventing immune decline in tumors. Previous studies
have described a therapeutic efﬁcacy of B16 autologous melanoma tumor vaccines expressing either GM-CSF or FMS-like
tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3-ligand), when combined with the
blocking CTLA-4 (29, 32, 36–38). We transduced ID8 whole
tumor cells to express either GM-CSF (ID8-GVAX; Fig. 5A) or
Flt3L (ID8-FVAX; Fig. 5B) and used irradiated cells as vaccine in
combination with PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 blockade. Mice
received weekly vaccine, starting 3 weeks after tumor inoculation. A week later, mice were treated with PD-1–blocking
antibodies ﬁve times on alternate days. Although GVAX alone
had no effect on tumor growth or mouse survival, the addition
of GVAX doubled the effect of checkpoint blockade on mouse
survival. Fifty percent of mice that received GVAX plus PD-1 or
PD-L1 blockade rejected their tumors, whereas antibodies
alone resulted in 25% tumor rejection (Fig. 5A, left). In contrast,
a-PD-L2 did not show any positive interaction with vaccination. Similar results were obtained with FVAX (Fig. 5B, left).
Interestingly, the positive interaction between vaccine and
checkpoint blockade required full development of the vaccine
effect, and this was achieved by increasing the time interval
between vaccination and checkpoint blockade to 1 week (data
not shown).
Costimulatory signals further augment the combination
of vaccine plus PD-L1 blockade
The earlier results indicate that PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade can
prevent immune decline in tumors, and that addition of
vaccine further enhances this effect. Next, we hypothesized
that adding a costimulatory signal, 4-1BB (CD137), a TNF
receptor gene family member (33, 39–42), could further boost
TILs and enhance the effects of checkpoint blockade and

vaccination. Mice were vaccinated with GVAX or FVAX starting 3 weeks after tumor inoculation, and a week later, we
administered ﬁve doses of a-PD-L1 on alternate days plus a
single dose of a-4-1BB (200 mg) antibody with the ﬁrst dose of
a-PD-L1 (Fig. 5A right). Administration of the a-4-1BB antibody alone had no impact on tumor growth or survival.
Furthermore, addition of a-4-1BB antibody to PD-L1 blockade
had moderate impact on survival (Fig. 5A, right). Remarkably,
75% of mice receiving GVAX followed by a-PD-L1 plus a-4-1BB
antibodies rejected their tumors. Similar results were obtained
with FVAX (Fig. 5B, right).
In tumors, costimulatory signals could be provided by
properly activated antigen-presenting cells (APC), which
express the 4-1BB ligand as well as other important costimulatory ligands. Hypothesizing that similar therapeutic beneﬁt
as earlier could be obtained through T-cell costimulation by
TLR-activated APCs, we used an agonistic murine TLR9 ligand,
CpG 1668 (43). Mice were treated with ﬁve doses of CpG 1668
intraperitoneally (5 mg/mouse) in combination with a-PD-L1
antibody (Supplementary Fig. S5). Similar to a-4-1BB, we found
signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁt by adding CpG. Importantly, the
effect from this combination was seen only when CpG was
given in combination with a-PD-L1 antibody, but not if CpG
was administered earlier in combination with the vaccine,
indicating that CpG did not contribute at enhancing T-cell
priming. Thus, the therapeutic PD-L1 blockade has the potential to induce signiﬁcant tumor rejection, which can be maximized if PD-L1 blockade is preceded by tumor vaccination,
and accompanied by costimulation.
Combination therapy reprograms the tumor immune
microenvironment
We next asked what were the changes in the tumor microenvironment induced by the ineffective vaccines GVAX and
FVAX. Interestingly, vaccine alone increased signiﬁcantly the
frequency of TILs, especially CD8þ cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 5A;
Supplementary Fig. S7A). Because vaccines proved ineffective,
we asked whether this was associated with an increase in
immunosuppressive populations. Importantly, we noticed that
both GVAX and FVAX failed to reduce the frequency of Tregs in
tumors. Moreover, GVAX increased the frequency of the MDSC
population in tumor leukocytes (Fig. 6C). Conversely, FVAX
increased the frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)
levels in tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6), which have been
shown to have immunosuppressive properties (44). Thus,
vaccine alone increased not only TILs but also immunosuppressive cells.
Mice treated with GVAX or FVAX plus a-PD-L1 showed
signiﬁcantly increased inﬁltration of total inﬂammatory
CD45þ cells and T cells in tumors compared with mice treated
with a-PD-L1 (P < 0.01) or vaccine (P < 0.001) alone. Among

PD-1 Blockade Restores Immune Function in Ovarian Cancer

them, CD8þ T cells were more abundant than CD4þ T cells (Fig.
6A; Supplementary Fig. S7A). When PD-L1 blockade was
combined with GVAX or FVAX, there was a moderate reduction in Treg as well as MDSC levels in the tumor (Fig. 6B and 6C;
Supplementary Figs. S7B and C). The addition of a-4-1BB to
a-PD-L1 signiﬁcantly increased TILs relative to each agent
alone, both CD8þ and CD4þ. In addition, it markedly
reduced Tregs relative to each agent alone. Consequently,
the combination of a-4-1BB plus a-PD-L1 resulted in a
marked increase in the CD8/Treg and CD4:Treg ratios,
superior than each antibody alone. The combination of
a-PD-L1 and a-4-1BB with GVAX or FVAX yielded the
highest frequency in TILs, both CD8þ and CD4þ. Furthermore, the addition of vaccine did not increase Tregs when
a-PD-L1 and a-4-1BB were combined with GVAX or FVAX,
thus resulting in the highest CD8/Treg and CD4:Treg ratios
seen in this study. In addition, the triple combination yielded
the highest frequency of Ki67þ CD8þ T cells compared with
that seen with the other combinations (Figs. 6D; Supplementary Fig. 7D). Combination treatment (either GVAX or
FVAX plus a-4-1BB and a-PD-L1) also increased granzyme B
expression, suggesting an enhancement in cytolytic potential of effector T cells (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. S7D).
Increased phosphorylation of T-bet and Eomes was induced
by a-PD-L1 antibody alone, and addition of a-4-1BB to
a-PD-L1 produced only moderate further increases (Figs.
6E and 7E). Thus, the PD-L1 blockade induced TIL activation, and the combination of GVAX (or FVAX) and a-4-1BB
treatment resulted in a further stimulation of the proliferative and cytolytic capability of TILs. Taken together, these
changes could result in a more permissive environment for
immune-mediated tumor rejection.
Combination therapy results in maximal stimulation of
tumor-reactive CD8þ TILs
Given the signiﬁcant changes in the tumor microenvironment, we next tested whether the functional capacity of tumorreactive CD8þ TILs was increased following combination
therapy. Tumors from the various treatment groups were
freshly dissociated enzymatically, and total leukocytes isolated
from these tumors were seeded in primary mixed cocultures
and stimulated with Kb-restricted peptides of folate receptor-a
or mesothelin, two known ovarian tumor antigens expressed
by ID8 cells. TIL cultures derived from mice treated with GVAX
or FVAX showed minimally increased IFN-g þ and TNF-aþ
CD8þ TIL when stimulated with the FR-a (SSGHNECPV) and
mesothelin (LSIFKHKL and LIWIPALL) peptides (Fig. 7A and
B; Supplementary Fig. S8). TIL cultures derived from mice
treated with a-PD-L1 alone showed modestly increased IFN-

g þ and TNF-aþ CD8þ TIL when stimulated with the peptides.
TIL cultures derived from mice treated with GVAX (or FVAX)
plus a-PD-L1 (not shown) or a-4-1BB showed further
increased IFN-g þ and TNF-aþ CD8þ TIL when stimulated
with the peptides. However, when mice were treated with
a-PD-L1 combined with GVAX (or FVAX) and a-4-1BB, TILs
exhibited the highest numbers of IFN-g þ and TNF-aþ CD8þ T
cells ex vivo (Fig. 7A and B). Importantly, the increase in IFN-g
production by TILs speciﬁc to FR-a and mesothelin peptides
seemed to be correlated with a decrease in tumor load (Figs. 3
and 5). The functional status of CD8þ TILs was corroborated by
testing the phosphorylation status of key transcription factors.
Triple combination therapy showed signiﬁcant increases in
pT-bet and pS6K levels, although only modest increase in
pEomes (Fig. 7C).

Discussion
In this study, we show a critically important role of the PD-1
pathway in establishing an immune privilege site in the ovarian
cancer microenvironment. Although tumors were inﬁltrated
by T cells in very early stages of tumor orthotopic inoculation, a
progressive reduction was noted in the frequency of CD8þ cells
and the CD8:Treg ratio, until very few TILs were ﬁnally found in
advanced tumors. Most of these were Tregs. The role of Tregs
in mediating immune suppression and tumor growth has been
previously established in ovarian cancer (24, 31). A parallel
increase in MDSCs and TAMs completed the picture of a wellorganized tumor immune-suppressive environment. These
ﬁndings are important in two ways. First, they indicate that
lack of tumor immunogenicity is not intrinsic, but rather is
acquired, at least in ID8 ovarian tumors. Second, we found that
such progressive establishment of immune suppression can be
reversed by blocking the PD-1 pathway. Thus, PD-1, besides
mediating TIL exhaustion, can facilitate a profound depletion
of TILs. Importantly, this phenomenon was mediated by PDL1, as PD-L1 blockade produced similar results, but not PD-L2.
PD-1 blockade restored the immune decline and led to
expansion of TILs. An increase in the number of CD4þ and
CD8þ cells was associated with increased CD8/Treg and CD4:
Treg ratios. This was associated with a moderate clinical
response, together with molecular evidence of functional
activation of TILs. Reversal of decline was time-sensitive, as
PD-1 blockade was more effective in earlier times, when more
TILs were present in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover,
the therapeutic effect of blocking PD-1/PD-L1 correlated with
increased numbers of polyfunctional ovarian tumor-antigen
(mouse folate receptor-a and mesothelin) speciﬁc CD8þ T
cells. In addition, our study provides further insight that tumor
antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells upregulate the key effector and

memory precursor signaling molecules (T-bet, Eomesodermin,
Akt, and S6 kinase) upon PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. This is in
agreement with recent studies that described inhibition of
signaling pathways by PD-1/PD-L1–mediated T-cell exhaustion (45–50).
Given this observation, we theorized that expanding the
pool of tumor-reactive TILs through a whole-tumor antigen
vaccine (GVAX or FVAX) could be beneﬁcial in more
advanced time points of the disease. We found that, in fact,
although ineffective on its own, vaccine could double the
efﬁcacy of PD-L1 blockade. Importantly, vaccine inefﬁciency
was not due to its inability to expand tumor-reactive TILs.
Rather, increase in TILs was accompanied by a similar
(compensatory) increase in Treg and other immunospuppressive populations (such as MDSCs or pDCs). Thus, failure
of vaccines was due to their failure to reprogram the tumor
microenvironment, which continued to take advantage of
homeostatic anti-inﬂammatory mechanisms such as Treg,
MDSCs, and/or pDCs. Importantly, PD-L1 blockade again
was able to break these homeostatic mechanisms, to establish tumor rejection. In addition, we found that administration of agonistic 4-1BB stimulation and a-PD-L1 after vaccination produced maximal expansion of TILs and tumor
rejection. We acknowledge that the dose of 4-1BB antibody
(200 mg) used was high for human translation and that, in
humans, 4-1BB agonistic antibodies have resulted in liver
toxicity (51). However, we believe that our studies still
provide proof of principle for adding costimulation to
checkpoint blockade as a beneﬁcial therapeutic combination. Interestingly, similar beneﬁt was also obtained by
administering CpG, a TLR9 agonist, intraperitoneally.
In this model, PD-L1 blockade was very effective, whereas
PD-L2 blockade was ineffective. This effect is likely due to the
high expression level of PD-L1 in ID8 tumor cells as well as
tumor-derived myeloid cells. Although a-PD-L2 blockade
resulted in moderately increased levels of TIL inﬁltration
(CD45þ, CD8þ), proliferation (Ki67þCD8þ), and signaling
molecules (Eomes, Akt, and pS6 kinase), Treg and MDSC levels
were not reduced after a-PD-L2 blockade. In this regard, we
previously noticed low-level expression of PD-L2 in other types
of tumor models (23). Therefore, the lack of response to a-PDL2 blockade may be due to low-level expression of PD-L2,
lacking sufﬁcient endogenous response upon in vivo blocking
PD-L2. Although our studies provide strong evidence of a role
of PD-L1 in the syngeneic ovarian model, they do not allow us
to discern the relative contribution of PD-L1 expressed by
tumor cells versus tumor stroma or inﬁltrating leukocytes.
Future studies using PD-L1 knockout mice and bone marrow
chimeras will be required to clarify this point. PD-L1 blockade
overcame the upregulation of MDSCs and pDCs by GVAX and
FVAX, respectively. Previous studies reported that FVAX was
more effective in combination with blockade therapy than
GVAX (34). Our study used different clones of rat anti-mouse
PD-1 (RMP1-30) and rat anti-mouse PD-L1 (10F.9G2) compared with the Bioxcell antibodies a-PD-1 (RMP1-14) and
a-PD-L1 (9G2) used in their study, which may have accounted
for eliminating the differences previously observed between
the two vaccine preparations.

Our ﬁndings have important implications in understanding the immunobiology of ovarian cancer and developing
rational therapies. We have previously described the classiﬁcation of ovarian cancers in tumors with and tumors
without intraepithelial TILs (4). The present ﬁndings suggest
that tumors lacking intraepithelial TILs may have a very
active PD-L1–mediated suppression, leading to depletion of
TILs. This would be in agreement with observations by
Hamanishi and colleagues reporting that increased expression of PD-L1 (but not PD-L2) is associated with poor
survival in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, similar
to the lack of intraepithelial TILs (10). Our ﬁnding of high
frequency of Tregs in tumors lacking TILs is consistent with
an association of Tregs with poor outcome in human ovarian
cancer (4) and with the observation that, in these tumors, we
found increased expression of vascular endothelial growth
factor (4), which also correlates with Treg preponderance in
the tumor microenvironment (31). On the basis of the
present ﬁndings, human ovarian cancer lacking intraepithelial TILs should not lack intrinsic immunogenicity, consistent with the notion that most advanced ovarian cancers
express known tumor-associated antigens and harbor tons
of nonsynonymous mutations, which could give rise to
immunogenic epitopes. Rather, powerful immunosuppressive factors would eliminate TILs, suggesting that reversal of
these factors would restore immune recognition and attack.
PD-L1 blockade could be an important step toward reversing
such immunosuppressive environment, but additional maneuvers are likely required to optimize tumor immune attack.
In the present study, addition of a whole-tumor antigen
vaccine signiﬁcantly enhanced the ability of PD-L1 blockade.
Importantly, just as in human patients with ovarian cancer
treated with GVAX (37, 52), vaccine alone was ineffective in
the mouse, but was quite beneﬁcial in association with
checkpoint blockade. We found that the reason whole-tumor
vaccines were ineffective was because they elicited a significant activation of tumor microenvironment homeostatic
mechanisms, with increased MDSCs or pDCs and no
decrease in Tregs. Importantly, PD-L1 blockade abrogated
this rebound increase in immunosuppressive cells and
depleted Tregs, resulting in clinical beneﬁt. Concomitant
costimulation, through an agonistic antibody or CpG, further enhanced this beneﬁt. Whole-tumor antigens have been
proposed as better alternatives than molecularly deﬁned
vaccines and can be effective in inducing antitumor immune
responses in patients with ovarian cancer (53). The
increased availability of immunomodulatory antibodies
could provide a new role for whole-tumor antigen vaccines
according to our ﬁndings.
