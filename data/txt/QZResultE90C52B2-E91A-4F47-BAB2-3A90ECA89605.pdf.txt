ABSTRACT
Oxidative stress is known to be involved in impairment of osteogenesis and
age-related osteoporosis. Cordycepin is one of the major bioactive components of
Cordyceps militaris that has been shown to exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
activities. However, there are few reports available regarding the effects of cordycepin
on osteogenesis and the underlying mechanism. In this study, we investigated the
potential osteoprotective effects of cordycepin and its mechanism systematically using
both in vitro model as well as in vivo mouse models. We discovered that hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) induced inhibition of osteogenesis which was rescued by cordycepin
treatment in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). Cordycepin
exerted its protective effects partially by increasing or decreasing expression
of osteogenic and osteoclastogenesis marker genes. Treatment with cordycepin
increased Wnt-related genes’ expression whereas supplementation of Wnt pathway
inhibitor reversed its protective effects. In addition, administration of cordycepin
promoted osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs by reducing oxidative stress in both
ovariectomized and aged animal models. Taken together, these results support the
protective effects of cordycepin on oxidative stress induced inhibition of osteogenesis
by activation of Wnt pathway.

INTRODUCTION

Hedgehog pathways [2].
It is now known that human bone marrow (BM)
harbors a rare population of mesenchymal stem cells
(MSC) which retains ability to self-renew and to
differentiate into multiple tissues [6]. MSCs exhibit
immunomodulatory properties, thereby emerging as
attractive candidates for various therapeutic applications
[7], especially regenerative medicine. It has been shown
that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in children
with defective osteogenesis allowed engraftment of
functional donor MSCs, resulting in increased bone
marrow density [8]. Therefore, BM-MSCs are believed to
hold great therapeutic potential in fracture injury and bone
regeneration [9].
Cordycepin, a derivative of the nucleoside
adenosine, is one of the major bioactive components of

Oxidative stress is described as an imbalance
between excess production of ROS and free radicals
(FR) and insufficient antioxidant system function
[1]. Several pieces of evidence have suggested a link
between oxidative stress, bone formation and osteogenic
differentiation [2]. It has been reported that oxidative
stress impairs bone mineral density in aged human subjects
and reduces osteogenic differentiation of murine preosteoblastic and bone marrow-derived stromal cell lines
which can be restored by antioxidants [3-5], suggesting
that oxidative stress plays an important role in bone injury
and age-related osteoporosis. It is well documented that
ROS regulates various signaling pathways involved
in osteogenesis, including Wnt/β-catenin, MAPK and

Cordyceps militaris [10]. Cordycepin has been shown
to have a variety of biological functions, including antitumor, antiviral, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory
activities [11-14]. Importantly, cordycepin has been shown
to attenuate age-related oxidative stress and enhances
antioxidant capacity in rats [10]. It has also been shown
to prevent rat hearts from ischemia/reperfusion injury
partially by activating antioxidant defense response via
upregulation of heme oxygenase (HO-1) expression [15].
However, there are few reports available regarding the
effects of cordycepin on osteogenesis and its potential
mechanism.
Wnt pathway acts as a fundamental signaling
pathway that regulates cell proliferation, cell polarity and
cell fate determination during embryonic development
and tissue homeostasis [16]. Dysregulation of this
pathway has been linked to congenital malformation,
cancer, osteoporosis and other diseases [17]. Recently,
accumulating evidence showed that activation of
canonical Wnt signaling led to enhanced bone density
whereas disruption of its activation impaired osteogenesis
primarily through regulating its downstream target genes,
such as β-catenin, cyclin D1, etc [18, 19].
Ovariectomized (OVX) mice are female mice whose
ovaries have been removed. OVX mouse model has been
used as a typical experimental model for investigation of
postmenopausal osteoporosis due to estrogen deficiency
in women. In our study, we investigated the potential
osteoprotective effects of cordycepin and the underlying
mechanism systematically using BM-MSCs as in vitro

model and OVX as well as aged mouse model as in vivo
models.

RESULTS
Effects of H2O2 and cordycepin treatment on cell
viability of human BM-MSC
We first characterized BM-MSCs by flow cytometry
and observed that majority of the cells were CD73+,
CD90+, CD105+, CD34- and CD45-, which are typical
characteristic phenotypes of BM-MSCs (Figure 1a).
Oxidative damage was induced by treating BM-MSCs
with increasing concentrations of H2O2 (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and
2 mM) for 24 hours. 0.2 mM and higher concentrations
of H2O2 significantly decreased cell viability in these
cells (Figure 1b). Treatment with cordycepin alone at
concentration of 10 μg/mL or lower did not affect cell
viability (Figure 1c). Importantly, 5 μg/mL or 10 μg/mL of
cordycepin in cells with 0.2 mM H2O2 exposure increased
cell viability compared to cells without cordycepin
treatment, indicating that cordycepin can partially inhibit
H2O2 induced cytotoxicity (Figure 1d). Also, the BMMSCs presented healthy growth and the population
doubling time was ~64 hours (Figure S1).

Cordycepin protects against H2O2 induced
inhibition of osteogenic differentiation of human
BM-MSC in vitro

Effects of cordycepin on the expression of
osteogenic markers
Based on the dose-related protective effects of
cordycepin above, 10 μg/mL cordycepin was chosen for
the following studies. We further evaluated the effects
of 10 μg/mL cordycepin on the expression of osteogenic
marker genes using RT-PCR. The results showed that the
expression of two osteogenic genes, OPN and Collagen
I, were significantly upregulated in cordycepin treated
cells compared to cells treated with 0.2 mM of H2O2 alone
(Figure 3a). Additionally, cordycepin markedly increased
the expression of OPG but reduced expression of RANKL
compared to H2O2 alone treated cells (Figure 3b). OPG
inhibits osteoclast differentiation by binding to RANKL.
The ratio between mRNA expressions of OPG to RANKL
is usually used as an indicator of osteoclastogenesis
inhibition [20]. Therefore, the above results suggest that
10 μg/mL cordycepin enhances osteogenic differentiation
partially through promoting expression of osteogenic
markers and inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.

We investigated protective effects of cordycepin
against H2O2 induced inhibition of osteogenic
differentiation by measuring ALP activity and calcium
content. 0.2 mM and higher concentrations of H2O2
or 40 μg/mL and higher concentration of cordycepin
alone significantly decreased ALP activity and calcium
content whereas 10 μg/mL of cordycepin increased ALP
activity and calcium content (Figure 2a and 2b). Cotreatment of 10 μg/mL of cordycepin reversed H2O2induced dysfunction as demonstrated by increased ALP
staining, activity and calcium content (Figure 2c-2e).
ALP activity and calcium content, which are indicators
for early and late osteogenesis, are measured 8 and 16
days after cell culture, respectively. Meanwhile, as an
essential transcription factor for osteogenesis, runt-related
transcription factor 2 (Runx2) was examined as well. The
mRNA levels of Runx2 were inhibited in the presence
of 0.2 mM H2O2, while co-treatment with 10 μg/mL of
cordycepin successfully restored the mRNA levels of
Runx2 (Figure 2f).

10 μg/mL cordycepin markedly reduced intracellular ROS

Involvement of Wnt pathway in the
osteoprotective effects of cordycepin on human
BM-MSCs

[2]. Western Blot analysis showed that 0.2 mM of H2O2
treatment reduced protein level of Wnt pathway related
regulators β-catenin and cyclin D1, which was rescued
by 10 μg/mL cordycepin co-treatment (Figure 5a and
5b). Meanwhile, cordycepin successfully reversed the
H2O2-induced inhibition of expression of β-catenin in the
nucleus (Figure 5c and 5d), implicating the involvement

It has been reported that ROS regulates signaling
cascades implicated in osteogenesis, such as Wnt pathway

of Wnt pathway in the protective effects of cordycepin.
This was further verified by the results from two other
gene markers of Wnt signaling pathway, Axin2 and c-myc.
H2O2 treatment depressed the mRNA levels of both Axin2
and c-myc, while cordycepin co-treatment restored their
expressions to control level (Figure 5e). Additionally,
supplementation of Wnt pathway inhibitor, DKK1 (0.2
μg/mL), reversed the protective effects of cordycepin
as demonstrated by the decreased ALP activity, calcium
content and Runx2 mRNA levels compared to cordycepin
treated cells (Figure 5f, 5g and 5h), further confirming the
possible involvement of Wnt pathway.

and GSH levels. OVX or aged mice were injected with
either vehicle or increasing concentration of cordycepin
(1, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg). OVX or aged receiving vehicle
showed significantly higher MDA levels and lower GSH
levels compared with control or young non-treated mice
whereas cordycepin administration reversed these effects
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6). These results
suggest that cordycepin can attenuate oxidative stress in
vivo.

Cordycepin attenuates oxidative stress in vivo

To evaluate the effects of cordycepin on in vivo
osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, we measured the

DISCUSSION

mg/kg). As shown in Figure 7, specimens derived from
OVX or aged mice showed decreased calcium content
compared to control or young non-treated mice. Treatment
with increased concentration of cordycepin increased
calcium content in a dose dependent manner, suggesting
that cordycepin can promote osteogenesis in vivo.

Many reports have provided evidence that there
is a link between oxidative stress, bone formation
and osteogenic differentiation. It has been shown that
oxidative stress impairs osteogenic differentiation of
murine pre-osteoblastic and bone marrow-derived stromal
cell lines [3]. Exogenous addition of H2O2 (125-500 μM)
to human BM-MSCs reduced Alp activity, a marker for
osteogenic differentiation and abolishes osteogenesis
in osteoblast progenitors [21, 22]. Additionally, NOX4
(NADPH oxidase 4) knockout mice exhibit higher bone
density. NOX4 promotes the transformation of osteoblasts
to osteoclasts, thus limiting bone mass [23]. Consistent
with these findings, we observed that exposure to H2O2
(0.2 mM or higher concentration) increased intracellular
ROS levels and reduced ALP activity, calcium content as
well as Runx2 mRNA levels, suggesting that oxidative
stress inhibits osteogenesis in these BM-MSCs.
It has been reported that cordycepin can protect
against estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis in
OVX rats [24]. Another study showed that cordycepin
can prevent hearts from ischemia/reperfusion injury via
activation of Akt/GSK-3b/p70S6K pathways and HO-1
expression, an antioxidant enzyme, in rat hearts [15].
Additionally, cordycepin has been reported to exert
neuroprotective effects by inhibiting glutamate-induced
oxidative apoptosis in HT22 cells [14]. Our results showed
that co-treatment with cordycepin significantly promoted
osteogenesis by reducing production of ROS induced by
H2O2 exposure in BM-MSCs. However, treatment with
cordycepin alone did not have effects, demonstrating
that cordycepin can exert osteoprotective effects in the
presence of excess oxidative stress.

Cordycepin augments in vivo bone formation
induced by BM-MSCs
To further study the effects of cordycepin on in vivo
bone formation induced by BM-MSCs in OVX animal
model, H&E staining and micro-computed tomography
(micro-CT) examination were employed in OVX-treated
mice. As shown in the H&E staining images (Figure
8a), the control mice showed normal compactness of the
diaphysis and competent trabeculae, while OVX mice
showed sparse, uniform thinning of trabeculae. The
disappearance and loss of connectivity resulted in bigger
intertrabecular spaces. This was obviously improved
by MSC treatment, especially when co-treated with
cordycepin (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg). Micro-CT examination
was used to detect the bone mass and bone mineral
density in the experimental groups (Figure 8b). As shown
in Figure 8c and d, OVX treatment (n = 8) induced a
significant loss in bone volume and bone mineral density
compared to control (n = 8). MSC treatment (n = 8)
significantly increased the bone volume and bone mineral
density, while co-treatment with cordycepin at 5, 10 or
20 mg/kg further greatly improved bone volume and bone
mineral density in a dose-dependent manner. These results
indicate that cordycepin is able to augment in vivo bone
formation induced by MSCs.

Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are responsible for
bone formation and bone resorption, respectively, the
two critical processes involved in bone remodeling. OPG
inhibits osteoclast differentiation by binding to RANKL
(receptor activator of nuclear factor-B ligand), which
is critical for the maturation and activity of osteoclasts
[25]. Several studies have shown that ROS can increase
expression of RANKL in osteoblasts [21]. An increase
in OPG;RANKL ratio favors bone formation whereas
a decrease in this ratio favors bone resorption [20]. We
observed that cordycepin significantly increased OPN
expression but reversed the H2O2 induced RANKL
upregulation to control level. Moreover, cordycepin
upregulated the expression of OPG and Collagen I, two

osteogenesis marker genes. These results indicate that
cordycepin can inhibit osteoclastogenesis and promote
osteogenic differentiation by increasing or decreasing
related genes’ expression.
Current studies support that Wnt signaling pathway
plays important roles in osteogenic differentiation
and bone formation [26, 27]. Activation of canonical
Wnt signaling results in higher bone density whereas
disruption of its activation impairs osteogenesis [18,
19]. Wnt signaling pathway contributes to osteogenesis
primarily through activation of β-catenin, which induces
essential signals for osteogenic initiation and reduces the
expression of C/EBPa and PPARg, key suppressors of
osteogenesis [2]. In this study, treatment with cordycepin

increased protein expression of β-catenin and cyclin D1,
another key target gene of Wnt pathway [28]. Additionally,
supplementation of DDK1, a Wnt pathway inhibitor,
reversed osteoprotective effects of cordycepin. These
results suggest that Wnt- β-catenin signaling pathway may
be involved in cordycepin promoted osteogenesis of BMMSCs.
Growing evidence supports that oxidative stress is
one of the main contributing factors to decline in cellular
functions due to aging [29]. The increased oxidative
stress has been associated with the pathogenesis of agerelated bone loss in humans and mice [30]. Importantly,
cordycepin has recently been shown to mitigate agerelated oxidative stress by enhancing antioxidant capacity
in rats [10]. We observed similar osteoprotective effects
of cordycepin in both OVS and aged mouse models in our
study, suggesting the potential of cordycepin for future
clinical applications.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated the
osteoprotective effects of cordycepin against H2O2 induced
inhibition of osteogenesis by reducing oxidative stress
both in vitro and in vivo. Cordycepin exerts this protective
effects partially by increasing or decreasing expression
of osteogenic and osteoclastogenesis marker genes as
well as activating Wnt pathway activity. Cordycepin may
represent a valuable regenerative medicine or a therapeutic
reagent for treatment of age-related osteoporosis in
humans.

Cordycepin with 98% purification was obtained
following the extraction and separation using a column
chromatographic method [31].

Induction of osteoblast differentiation
Approximately 1×104 cells BM-MSCs were placed
in a 35 mm culture dish (Corning, Corning, USA).
Osteoblast differentiation was induced by culturing
cells in osteogenic medium composing of DMEM-high
glucose, 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, USA), 100-100 μg/
mL penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, USA),
50 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (Sigma, St. Louisa,
USA), L-glutamine (Sigma, St. Louisa, USA), 10-7 M
dexamethasone (Sigma, St. Louisa, USA), and 10 mM
β-glycerophosphate (Sigma, St. Louisa, USA) for 21 days.
Media was changed every 3 days.

Flow cytometry
BM-MSC cells were trypsinized and stained with
anti-CD34-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), CD45FITC, CD73-FITC, CD90-FITC, CD105 (endoglin)FITC, and were analyzed by FACScalibur flow cytometry
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell viability assay

Isolation and culture of human BM-MSC

For this experiment, the BM-MSC cells were treated
with different concentration of H2O2 (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and
2 mM) for 24 h. Different concentrations of cordycepin
(1, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 μg/mL) were supplemented in
the culture medium during the whole culture. MTT assays
were performed to measure cell survival. The absorbances
of all of the wells were recorded using a micro-plate
reader at 492 nm wavelength. The cell survival of the
control group, which was not exposed to either H2O2 or
cordycepin, was defined as 100%.

Bone marrow samples were obtained from 4 fetuses
(median gestational age, 1315 weeks; range, 1112 to
1413). Single-cell suspensions of fetal bone marrow were
prepared by flushing the bone marrow cells out of the
humeri and femurs using a syringe and 22-gauge needle
DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, USA)penicillin (100 U/mL)
(Sigma, St. Louisa, USA),, and streptomycin (100 μg/
mL) (Sigma, St. Louisa, USA),. All cultured cells were
incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37ºC and at 5%
CO2. To expand the cells through successive passages, they
were plated at 104 cells/cm2, grown to near confluence, and
harvested with the same protocol. To isolate individual
colonies, nucleated cells were plated in a 100-mm dish
at a density of 12 000/cm2 and were collected by cloning
cylinders (Sigma, St. Louisa, USA) and expanded.
Cultured fetal MSCs were recloned by single-cell sorting
using FACS Vantage (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,
USA).

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay
BM-MSC cells (3 × 103 cells/well) were incubated
in a 96-well plate overnight and treated with different
concentrations of H2O2 for 24h and/or the cordycepin in
the medium for the whole duration of culture. ALP activity
was measured in total cell lysates after homogenization in
a buffer containing 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.5% Triton
X-100, 10 mM Mg2+, and 5 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate
as substrates. The absorbance was read at 405 nm. The
ALP activity was normalized to total protein, which was
measured using the Bradford protein assay. The assay was

Calcium accumulation assay
To evaluate osteogenic differentiation, the calcium
content in BM-MSCs was measured using Calcium
Assay 16 days after cell culture (Genzyme Diagnostics,
Charlottetown, PE, Canada) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, samples were added with 1 M acetic
acid and placed on a vortex overnight at 4°C to extract
the calcium from the mineralized matrix. In a 96-well
clear polycarbonate plate, 15 μL cell extract was mixed
with 150 μL Calcium Assay reagent and incubated for
30 s at room temperature. The absorbance at 650 nm was
determined using a SpectraMAX 250 microplate reader.
The samples were measured in triplicate and compared
to the calcium calibration curve. The calcium content
was normalized by cell protein amount and expressed as
relative calcium content normalized to control sample.

Intracellular ROS levels determination
ROS level was measured using fluorescence
associated oxidation of dichlorodihydrofluorescein
(DCFH) to dichlorofluorescein (DCF; [32]). After treated
with H2O2 and/or cordycepin, cells cultured on 8×8
mm square glass coverslips were rinsed with ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated in
10 μM DCFH-DA (Sigma, St. Louisa, USA) for 15 min
at 37°C in the dark. Fluorescence was measured using
confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510) at excitation
and emission wavelengths of 495 and 535 nm for DCF
fluorescence. In average, ten BM-MSC cells/ microscope
field were quantified in three to four separate cultures
per treatment condition. Zeiss confocal microscope was
used to visualize DCF fluorescence. ImageJ was used to
quantify fluorescence intensity.

Nuclear fraction and western blot
Cell lysate from the tissues was extracted using
RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz, Dallas, USA) containing
1 % protease inhibitor cocktail. For β-catenin analysis
in the nucleus, cells were harvested and subjected to
nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation using NE-PER
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo
Scientific, USA) according to the instruction. Briefly,
cells were washed with PBS, centrifuged down and left
dry. Reagents CER I and CER II were added followed
by centrifugation. Supernatant that contains cytoplasmic
extract was discarded. Reagent NER was added to
dissolve the pallet, which contains nuclear extract.
Extracts were subjected to further western blot analysis
or stored at -80 oC for further use. For electrophoresis, a
total of 30 µg of protein were loaded onto a 12 % SDSPAGE gel. After transfer, membranes were blocked in 5
% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/Tween-20
(0.2 %) overnight at 4 ºC and then incubated with rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against β-catenin, cyclin-D1, H3
and GAPDH diluted in TBS/T for 1 h at37 ºC. After three
washes in TBS/T, the membranes were incubated with
anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
(Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing,
China) at a dilution of 1:2,000 in TBS/T for 40 min at

Real time-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from BM-MSCs treated
with H2O2 and/or cordycepin, using TRIZOL reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). 1 μg RNA was initially
reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript™
III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
USA). Real-time quantitative PCR reactions were set up
in triplicate with Ssofast Master Mix (Biorad) and run on
a LightCycler® 480 (Roche, New Yok, USA). The genes
osteopontin (OPN) and collagen I were measured to assess
osteogenic differentiation. For osteoclast differentiation,
osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of
nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) were measured.
The housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), was used as an endogenous

an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Zhongshan Golden
Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing China).

In vivo osteogenesis of MSCs under cordycepin
treatment

Animal experiments

A total of 1 × 106 MSCs was injected under the skin
of the mice. After anesthesia with subcutaneous injection
of a combination of 0.5 µL/g of tiletmine-zolazepam
and 0.5 µL/g xylazine, small skin incisions were made
and subcutaneous pouches were formed in the back of
experimental animals, into which the MSCs were injected.
After that, the skin incisions were closed with 4-0 nylons.
For the cordycepin treated group, the mice were treated
with cordycepin (1, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) during the whole
experiment. To measure the calcium contents of in vivo
implanted specimens, each sample was deparaffinized,
dried at 95oC for 1 h, weighed and decalcified in 1 mL of
Calci-clear Rapid. The calcium content of the supernatants
was determined by spectrophotometry using Methylxylene
blue method.

Ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model was
established as described before [33]. Briefly, forty eight
8-week-old, BALB/c female mice with similar weight
were obtained from Shanghai Jiaotong University. After
adaptation to the laboratory environment (a well-ventilated
controlled room at 20 °C on a 12-h light/dark cycle; the
animals were given free access to water and food) for 1
week, the mice experienced sham-operation (n = 10) or
were surgically ovariectomized (n = 40) under anesthesia
using pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg body weight, i.p.).
The ovariectomy operation was performed according to
Steven K. Boyd’s procedure [34]. For the aged animal
model, eight young BALB/c female mice (8-weekold) and forty old BALB/c female mice (one-year-old)
were obtained from Shanghai Jiaotong University and
acclimatized to the facility for at least 1 week prior to the
experiment. For in vivo osteogenesis experiments (Figure
7) in both mouse models, mice were divided into control
group (n = 8) or cordycepin treated groups (4 groups,
n=8 for each group). Experimental mice received i.p.
injection of 1, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg of cordycepin daily for
four months. For the experiments in Figure 8, the animals
received the different concentrations of cordycepin daily
until the end of experiment (8 weeks). This study was
carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations
in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
of the National Institutes of Health (Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals, 9th edition). The protocol
was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal
Experiments of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated
Sixth People’s Hospital. All surgery was performed under
sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made
to minimize suffering.

Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining
The femurs were cleaned and placed in decalcifying
solution and 10% formic acid in PBS for 24 h, then
dehydreated in 95% ethanol and embedded in paraffin. The
sections were cut and stained with H&E and examined by
light microscopy.

Micro-computed
examination

(micro-CT)

The femurs were evaluated by micro-CT (Scanco
Medical AG, Switzerland). The scanning parameters were
set at 50 kV, 100 μA. Images were reconstructed and
analyzed with Scanco Medical software. Fractional bone
volume is determined as bone volume per tissue volume,
while bone mineral density was calculated.

Statistical analysis

MDA, GSH measurement

Results are expressed as mean±SEM, and statistical
comparisons were performed using the Student t test.
Statistical difference was considered to be significant only
if P <0.05.

The activity of malondialdehyde (MDA) in whole
blood samples from OVX and aged mouse models
receiving i.p. injections of 1, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg of
cordycepin was determined using a lipid peroxidation
MDA assay kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The binding of thiobarbituric acid to MDA
results in a chromogenic complex that can be detected
at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer. The activity of
Glutathione (GSH) was determined using the GSH assay
kit. The GSH activity was determined by the reaction of
GSH with 5.50-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB)
to produce a product that could be measured using a
spectrophotometer at 412 nm.
