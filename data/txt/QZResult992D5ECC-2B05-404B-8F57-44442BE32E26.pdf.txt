ABSTRACT
The POU class 1 homeobox 1 (POU1F1, also known as Pit-1), pertaining to the
Pit-Oct-Unc (POU) family of transcription factors, has been related to tumor growth
and metastasis in breast. However, its role in response to breast cancer therapy is
unknown.
We found that Pit-1 down-regulated DNA-damage and repair genes, and
specifically inhibited BRCA1 gene expression, sensitizing breast cancer cells to
DNA-damage agents. Administration of 1α, 25-dihydroxy-3-epi-vitamin D3 (3-Epi,
an endogenous low calcemic vitamin D metabolite) reduced Pit-1 expression, and
synergized with cisplatin, thus, decreasing cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro,
and reducing tumor growth in vivo. In addition, fifteen primary cultures of human
breast tumors showed significantly decreased proliferation when treated with
3-Epi+cisplatin, compared to cisplatin alone. This response positively correlated with
Pit-1 levels.
Our findings demonstrate that high levels of Pit-1 and reduced BRCA1 levels
increase breast cancer cell susceptibility to 3-Epi+cisplatin therapy.

improved clinical outcome. Research has led to additional
classifications of breast cancer subtypes [3–6]. However,
some tumors do not respond well to treatment, even those
classified under subtypes with generally good prognosis.
For example, some estrogen receptor (ER) positive
tumors with high somatic mutation load are associated

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is currently treated according to the
biological characteristics of the tumor (i.e. Luminal,
HER2-enriched, basal-like, and normal breast-like)
[1–2], which has permitted personalized therapies and

with poor overall survival [7]. HER2 tumor subtype also
shows variable response to treatment depending on ER
and progesterone receptor (PR) expression [8]. The basallike subtype, often called triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC), usually has a bad prognosis because no targeted
therapy exists for this subgroup of patients [4]. The basallike subtype of tumors shows the highest frequency of
DNA loss and gain compared with other subtypes [9].
In breast cancer, at least 35 significantly mutated genes,
either by germline or somatic mutations, have been
identified [10–11]. Half of these genes, including BRCA1,
are associated with DNA-damage response [12]. BRCA1
is involved in the differentiation of breast epithelial
cells [13], and its mutation impairs luminal progenitor
cell differentiation and converts ER-positive luminal
tumors into basal-like cancer [14]. Recently, it has been
suggested that BRCA1 gene heterozygosity suffices for
cancer predisposition, by triggering genome instability
that accumulates over many cell divisions [15].
Numerous studies have demonstrated that the 1α,
25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol, 1, 25D) hormone,
which is the most biologically active form of vitamin D,
regulates calcium and phosphorus homeostasis as well as
other physiological and pathological processes including
cell proliferation and differentiation. This has led to
the study of its effects in cancer [16]. In human breast
cancer cells, 1, 25D inhibits cycle progression, induces
apoptosis, modulates cancer invasion and metastasis, and
inhibits angiogenesis [17]. In addition, 1, 25D and its
analogues can enhance, either synergistically or additively,
the antitumor properties of several antineoplastic agents
such as DNA-damaging agents (i.e., cisplatin) [18].
Nevertheless, its use in therapy has been limited because
of its hypercalcemic side effects.
In breast cancer, previous studies have demonstrated
that 1, 25D administration inhibits the Pit-1 transcription
factor at the transcriptional level [19]. Pit-1 (also
known as POU1F1) is expressed in the mammary
gland [20], and its deregulation induces a malignant
phenotype in breast cancer cells associated with tumor
growth and metastasis [21]. However, its role in
breast cancer  response  to  therapy  is unknown. The 1α,
25-dihydroxy-3-epi-vitamin D3 (3-Epi) is a low-calcemic
vitamin D metabolite that was initially identified in the
culture of human neonatal keratinocytes [22]. It has been
shown that 3-Epi has similar biological activity to 1, 25D
[23]. Therefore, this less calcemic vitamin D analogue,
could be appropriate for treatment of breast tumor with
elevated levels of Pit-1.
The present study evaluated the relationships
between Pit-1 and BRCA1 in breast cancer, and the
effect of the administration of cisplatin and 3-Epi in
breast cancer cell lines, primary cultures of human breast
tumors, and mice models. We show that Pit-1 inhibits
BRCA1 gene expression and sensitizes breast cancer cells

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to DNA-damage agents, such as cisplatin. In addition,
administration of 3-Epi synergizes with cisplatin, thus,
decreasing cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro,
and reducing tumor growth in vivo. Our results reveal
Pit-1 as a new marker for breast tumors susceptible to
3-Epi+cisplatin therapy.

RESULTS
Pit-1 sensitizes breast cancer cells to
DNA-damage
Pit-1 expression levels in breast cancer cell lines
were evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blot. Our
data showed Pit-1 mRNA and protein expression in all
breast cancer cell lines (Figure 1A-1B). Given that Pit-1
tends to have higher expression in aggressive cell lines, we
carried out a microarray analysis, qRT-PCR, and Western
blot in the low-aggressive MCF-7 (with low basal Pit-1
levels) cell line before and after Pit-1 overexpression.
With respect to control MCF-7 cells, we found that Pit-1
overexpression significantly (P < 0.05) decreased DNAdamage response genes, such as BRCA1, and RAD
family members, while it increased, but not significantly,
DNA-damage sensor genes, such as GADD45A
(Figure 1C-1D). Given that Pit-1 modify DNA-damage
response/sensor genes, we further evaluated the role of Pit1 on DNA-damage sensitivity. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells with low and high basal Pit-1 levels, respectively,
were manipulated to induce Pit-1 overexpression or Pit1 knockdown, and treated with the DNA-damage agent
cisplatin (10 μM for 48 hours) or UV radiation, followed
by Western blotting to determine phosphorylated histone
H2AX (p-H2AX), a well known DNA double-strand break
marker. Increased DNA-damage was found in cells with
high Pit-1 levels after chemical and radiation challenge
(Figure 1E).

Pit-1 inhibits BRCA1 in breast cancer cells and
human tumors
Given that Pit-1 reduced BRCA1 mRNA and protein
expression (Figure 1C-1D), and that BRCA1 is a key
protein in DNA-damage response, we evaluated the role
of Pit-1 in BRCA1 regulation. Real-time PCR showed
significantly (P < 0.001) decreased BRCA1 mRNA levels
after Pit-1 overexpression in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2A).
Pit-1 regulated BRCA1 at transcriptional level in MCF-7
cells, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) (Figure 2B-2C) and luciferase reporter assays
(Figure 2D-2E). We found specific Pit-1 binding to the
position located between -1025 to -1033 base pairs (bp)
from the start transcription site in the BRCA1 gene
promoter, as demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis
(Figure 2D-2E).

(P  <  0.001) increased rate of early apoptosis (annexin
V+/PI-) was observed in 3-Epi+cisplatin- treated cells,
compared to cells treated with cisplatin alone (Figure 5C,
and Supplementary Figure S1B). Protein analyses
demonstrated increased levels of cleaved PARP and
active caspase 3, and decreased levels of the anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 protein after 3-Epi+cisplatin treatment, compared
to cisplatin alone (Figure 5D, and Supplementary
Figure S1C).
To assess if 3-Epi+cisplatin produced more
DNA damage than cisplatin alone, DNA fragmentation
and DNA damage-induced proteins were evaluated.
By comet assay we showed that 3-Epi+cisplatin
treatment in MCF-7/Pit-1 cells induced a significantly
(P <  0.05) longer trailing tail, indicating increased
DNA fragmentation (Figure 6A). Immunofluorescence
analysis of p-H2AX showed increased DNA damage
after 3-Epi+cisplatin as compared to cisplatin alone
(Figure 6B). Proteins involved in DNA damage
and repair were also evaluated by Western blot in
MCF-7/Pit-1 cells. Figure 6C shows high basal
phosphorylation levels for ATM, BRCA1, and p53, as
well as increased ATM, ATR, Chk1, Chk2, BRCA1,
p53, Rb, and H2AX phosphorylation in cisplatin-treated
cells. Treatment with 3-Epi+cisplatin increased p-Chk1
and p-H2AX proteins, with respect to cisplatin alone.
To further compare the effect of treatments on MCF7/Pit-1 (overexpressing Pit-1) and wild MCF-7 cells, a
Western blot of Bcl-2, cleaved PARP, caspase 3 active,
p-Chk1, and p-H2AX proteins was also carried out.
Figure 6D  shows that high levels of Pit-1 potentiate

PCR and Western blot. We found VDR expression in
all cell lines evaluated, as previously demonstrated [24]
(Figure 3A-3B). Given that the use of 1, 25D in therapy is
limited because of its hypercalcemic side effects, we tested
to see if the 3-Epi vitamin D derivative (Figure 3C) had
similar biological properties. We carried out a luciferase
gene reporter assay and in vivo calcemic analysis in mice.
Both 3-Epi and 1, 25D regulated the CYP24A1 gene, a
classic 1, 25D target with similar EC50 (Figure  3D).
However, no significant hypercalcemic activity was
observed in mice treated with 3-Epi at doses of 1 μg/kg
weight (Figure 3E). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were
also treated with 1, 25D or 3-Epi (10 to 1000 nM), and
Pit-1 was evaluated by Western blot. Importantly, both
3-Epi and 1, 25D at 100 and 1000 nM reduced basal Pit-1
expression (Figure 3F), as previously demonstrated for 1,
25D [19].

3-Epi synergizes with cisplatin in Pit-1
sensitized cells
Using breast cancer cell lines with different levels
of Pit-1 (MCF-7, MCF-7/Pit-1, MDA-MB-231, and
MDA-MB-231/shPit-1), which therefore had different
sensitivity to DNA-damage agents (see Figure 1E), MTT
assays were performed to evaluate cell proliferation
after treatment with 3-Epi, cisplatin, and both together.
Proliferation response to 3-Epi and cisplatin was
better (reduced proliferation) in cells with high Pit-1
expression (Figure 4A–4F). Our data also indicated
synergy in cells treated with 3-Epi at doses of 100 nM
and 5 μM cisplatin, and this synergy was higher in cells
with elevated Pit-1 expression (combination index (CI):
0.03  in MCF-7/Pit-1 cells, and 0.12 in MDA-MB-231
cells) (Figure 4C, and 4G). Proliferation percentages in
control and treated cells, as well as the CI are shown in
Figure 4G.
To evaluate why combination of 3-Epi+cisplatin
synergistically reduced cell proliferation in cells with
Pit-1 overexpression, we first evaluated cell cycle. MCF7/Pit-1 cells were treated with 3-Epi, cisplatin, and
3-Epi+cisplatin, and subjected to flow cytometry using
propidium iodide (PI). 3-Epi did not significantly modify
cell cycle, in relation to control cells. As expected, cisplatin
reduced G2-M and increased S phases of cell cycle with
respect to control and 3-Epi-treated cells. The combination
of both drugs increased the G0–G1 phase as compared to
cisplatin administration alone (Figure 5A). Western blot
showed that 3-Epi+cisplatin reduced cyclin D expression
as compared to cisplatin alone, which seems to delay
entry of cells into G1 and S phases, as shown by reduced
expression of cyclin A (Figure 5B). To study the effect
of 3-Epi and cisplatin on apoptosis, MCF-7/Pit-1
cells were treated, stained with AnnexinV-FITC and
PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry. A significantly

Cisplatin+3-Epi reduced breast tumor growth
To explore the effect of 3-Epi and cisplatin on
tumor growth in vitro, MCF-7/Pit-1 cells were cultured
in matrigel. After forming three-dimensional (3D)
cultures, cells were treated for 4 days. Administration
of cisplatin+3-Epi significantly (P < 0.01) enhanced
the effect of cisplatin, thus, decreasing culture growth
(Figure 7A–7B). To further evaluate the effect of both
drugs on tumor growth in vivo, we used the SCID mouse
tumor xenograft model. SCID mice were subcutaneously
injected on day 0 with MCF-7/Pit-1 cells, and fifteen
days later treated intraperitoneally (i.p) with sesame oil,
3-Epi, cisplatin, and 3-Epi+cisplatin. Tumor growth at
day 35 (21 days after treatment) was significantly lower
in mice injected with MCF-7/Pit-1 cells and treated
with 3-Epi+cisplatin as compared to cisplatin alone
(P = 0.0093) (Figure 7C–7D). Representative images of
treated mice are shown in Figure 7D. Calcium in serum
was also determined at day 35 in MCF-7/Pit-1 injected
mice. Mice treated with 3-Epi and 3-Epi+cisplatin showed
no hypercalcemia (Figure 7E).

vitamin D derivative 3-Epi to breast cancer cells synergizes
with cisplatin, thus, increasing accumulation of cells at­
G0–G1 phase of cell cycle, DNA damage and apoptosis, and
decreasing tumor growth. In addition, primary cultures of
human breast tumors treated with 3-Epi+cisplatin presented
significantly less proliferation as compared to treatment with

expression levels.

after 3-Epi+cis as compared with cisplatin. C. Representative Western blot of Pit-1 levels in primary breast tumors. Pit-1 expression
was evaluated by quantitative Western blot. Values were corrected by GAPDH expression. D. Statistical analyses indicated that reduced
proliferation response to 3-Epi+cis as compared to cisplatin alone is correlated with Pit-1 levels.

Pit-1 inversely correlated with BRCA1 mRNA levels in
human breast tumors samples, which is in line with other
microarray datasets [25–27]. Reduction of BRCA1 levels
in mammary epithelial cells has been found to enhance
cell proliferation and down-regulate differentiation genes
[13]. It has also been found that treatment with a retroviral
vector expressing wild-type BRCA1 significantly inhibited
tumor growth and increased survival in mice with

agents. In fact, higher levels of Pit-1 were related to higher
sensitization to DNA-damage agents, such as ultraviolet
light radiation or cisplatin treatment.
Given that BRCA1 protein has a tumor-suppressive
role and is considered to be a “chromosome custodian”
[15], we delved into the relationships between Pit-1
and BRCA1. We found that Pit-1 negatively regulated
BRCA1 transcription in breast cancer cells, and that

established MCF-7 tumors [28]. Given that Pit-1 downregulates DNA-damage and repair genes (i.e. BRCA1)
and sensitizes breast cancer cells to DNA-damage agents,
in this study we used the antineoplastic drug, cisplatin,
which is frequently applied to BRCA1-associated breast
tumors [29].
Human breast tumors have recently been classified
by Santagata et al. [6] according to vitamin D, androgen,
and estrogen hormone receptor expression, suggesting
that combining VDR agonists (i.e. 1, 25D or analogues)
with standard chemotherapy treatment could inhibit
proliferation more effectively than chemotherapy alone
[6]. Therefore, we combined cisplatin with 3-Epi,
a 1, 25D natural derivative [30]. 1, 25D or some of its
analogues have been combined with cisplatin and other
chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of breast
cancer, showing synergism and potentiation of cisplatin
effect [17–18, 31–32]. However, the anti-tumor results
of this approach have been disappointing probably
because hypercalcemia concerns have led to the use
of 1, 25D in low doses [33–34]. Our data indicates that
3-Epi has similar biological properties without inducing
hypercalcemia at doses at least three times higher
than 1, 25D. In addition, 3-Epi has a greater metabolic
stability than 1, 25D because its inactivation by the
CYP24A1 catabolic enzyme is much slower [35]. Here,
we demonstrate that 3-Epi reduces Pit-1 expression in
MCF-7 cells, as demonstrated previously with 1, 25D
[19]. Treatment of MCF-7/Pit-1 and MDA-MB-231 cell
lines with 3-Epi+cisplatin showed synergy with respect
to cisplatin alone. Combined treatment decreased cell
proliferation and cyclin D expression, arresting cells
at G0 phase of cell cycle, as shown by reduced cyclin
A expression, and increased apoptosis.
In addition, comet assay, and p-H2AX
immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that
3-Epi+cisplatin significantly increased DNA damage
with respect to either drug alone. Our results clearly
demonstrated that the 3-Epi+cisplatin combination
was more effective in reducing tumor growth than
administration of either drug alone. Finally, using
primary cultures of human breast tumors, and given
that Pit-1 protein levels seem to be a better marker for
1, 25D-sensitivity than Pit-1 mRNA levels, we evaluated
cell proliferation after 3-Epi, cisplatin, and 3-Epi+cisplatin
treatment, and correlated the effect on cell proliferation
with Pit-1 protein expression. Cell proliferation was
significantly decreased after 3-Epi+cisplatin treatment as
compared to cisplatin alone, and this effect was positively
related to Pit-1 expression.
Our data correlate with previous studies showing
better response to cisplatin treatment in breast cancer
patients with low BRCA1 levels [29, 36], and studies
showing increased BRCA1 expression in breast cancer
cells after treatment with 1, 25D or vitamin D analogues

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[37–38]. Recently, BRCA1 and VDR association has been
demonstrated to activated genes involved in anti-tumor
effects of vitamin D, and that a complete knockdown
of BRCA1 abolishes the effects of vitamin D analogues
[39]. Our data also demonstrate that Pit-1 levels are
important to predicting treatment response, and, that
administration of 3-Epi+cisplatin in patients with elevated
Pit-1 levels could improve clinical outcomes in relation
to cisplatin alone. In addition, a recent study by Huang
et al. [40] has demonstrated that Pit-1 binds and represses
MRE11 gene expression, sensitizing breast cancer cells
to chemotherapeutic treatments. Although we cannot
conclude from our data that MRE11 is involved in the
sensitization of breast cancer cells to 3-Epi+cisplatin
in Pit-1 overexpressed cells, our findings are in line
with those observed by Huang et al. Further studies are
necessary to confirm this data.
In summary, our study demonstrates that Pit-1
transcriptionally represses BRCA1 expression, and
sensitizes breast cancer cells to combined treatment with
cisplatin and the low calcemic 3-Epi vitamin D metabolite.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
1, 25D and 3-Epi were synthesized at the
Department of Organic Chemistry (University of
Santiago de Compostela, Spain) as detailed in Supporting
Information. Cisplatin was obtained from Ferrer Farma
laboratories (Barcelona, Spain).

Cell lines, primary cultures, treatments, and
breast tumors cDNA samples
The human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines
MCF-7, T47D, Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 were obtained
from European Collection of Cell Culture (ECACC;
Porton Down, UK). The human breast adenocarcinoma
cell lines BT474, SKBR3, HCC1937 and HCC1187 were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC;
Manassas, USA). The HBL100 breast cancer cell line
was obtained from Cell Lines Service (CLS; Eppelheim,
Germany). All cells were grown as previously described
[21]. Three-dimensional cultures, isolation and culture
of primary breast tumors are described in supplementary
methods. Patient and tumor characteristics are shown
in Supplementary Table S1. Breast cancer cell lines
and primary cultures were treated for 48 h with ethanol
(control cells), 3-Epi (10, 100 and 500 nM), cisplatin (1, 5,
and 10 μM), and 3-Epi+cisplatin (100 nM+5 μM) in the
MTT assay. In all other in vitro experiments, 3-Epi was
used at 100 nM, cisplatin at 5 μM, and 3-Epi+cisplatin at
doses of 100 nM+5 μM, respectively, unless specifically
indicated. Cisplatin and 3-Epi were diluted in PBS

and ethanol, respectively. Treatment of cells with UV
radiation was carried out by exposure to 150 J/m2 of
UV radiation for 30 min. Pit-1 and BRCA1 mRNA
expression was evaluated by real-time PCR in human
breast tumors (n = 41, Tissue Scan cDNA array, Origene,
Rockville, USA).

Information. The pCYP24A1-luc vector (1 μg, kindly
provided by Dr. Aranda, Madrid) encodes the luciferase
gene under control of a consensus vitamin D response
element (CYP24A1), and is very responsive to 1, 25D
treatment.
ChIP assay was carried out in control and Pit-1
overexpressing MCF-7cells. Briefly, cells were fixed
for 10 min with paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS,
lysed andsonicated. Diluted soluble chromatin fractions
were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg polyclonal anti-Pit-1
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or control human
IgG (Sigma Aldrich, Madrid, Spain). The histone-DNA
crosslinks were reversed by 4 h incubation at 65°C. The
DNA from these samples was extracted through phenol/
chloroform and ethanol precipitated with 20 μg of
glycogen. The DNA extracted was then dissolved in 30 μl
of H2O. PCR was used to analyze the DNA fragment from
the ChIP assay. Five microliters of assayed DNA (ChIP
sample) and 5 μl of input/start material were used in each
50-μl reaction. Primers and PCR procedures are detailed
in Supporting Information.

RNA isolation, real-time PCR, mRNA
microarray, and Western blot
Total RNA from the cell lines and primary cultures
was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Barcelona,
Spain). cDNA synthesis was performed as described
elsewhere [21]. Pit-1, BRCA1, RAD1, RAD18, RAD51,
RAD52, RAD54B, GADD45A, GADD45B, GADD45G,
vitamin D receptor (VDR) and 18S mRNA levels were
quantified using real-time PCR. Microarray assay of
mRNA was performed using an Affymetrix Human Gene
1.0 ST Array (GEO database access no. GSE64101).
Western blotting was performed as previously described
[21]. Relative protein expression was quantified using
ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
USA). Pit-1 quantification in primary cultures of human
breast tumors was performed using the LI-COR Odyssey
software (Homburg, Germany). Primers and antibodies are
described in Supporting Information.

Cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis,
immunofluorescence (IF) and comet assays
Cell proliferation assays were carried out by MTT
assay, as previously described [41].
In order to determine whether the combination
of 3-Epi and cisplatin was additive, antagonist, or
synergistic, we used the CalcuSyn v2.0 software
programme (Biosoft, Ferguson, USA) as previously
described [42]. This program allows the calculation
of the combination index (CI) based on the algorithm
of Chou and Talalay. Combination index values less
than 1 indicate synergism, values equal to 1 indicate
an additive effect, whereas values greater than 1
indicate antagonism. Combination index values from
three independent experiments were generated. Results
were plotted as the mean values of duplicates from two
independent experiments.
For cell cycle analyses MCF-7/Pit-1 cells were
cultured, treated with different drugs for 24 hours,
and stained with propidium iodide (PI). For apoptosis
analyses, MCF-7/Pit-1 cells were incubated in the dark
with Annexin V-FITC (BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA),
and PI for 48 hours. DNA content, cell cycle analyses,
and apoptosis were done in a Guava EasyCyteTM (Merck
Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). For IF assays, MCF-7/
Pit-1 cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 24 hours,
treated with the drugs for 48 hours, and incubated
overnight with an anti-pH2AX antibody. Evaluation
of DNA fragmentation by comet assay was performed
using a protocol for the single cell gel electrophoresis as
previously described [42]. The average comet tail length
is indicated.

Plasmids, transfections, and luciferase
reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays
Transient transfections were performed in MCF-7
cells using the pcDNA3-Pit-1 overexpression vector
and the pcDNA3 empty vector as control. Stable
transfection of Pit-1 into MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/Pit1) was performed as previously described [21] and
briefly explained  in  Supplemental Information. Stable
clones of Pit-1 knock-down in MDA-MB-231 cells
(MDA-MB-231/shPit-1) were performed as described in
Supplemental Information. Stable Pit-1 overexpressing
MCF-7 (MCF-7/Pit-1) cells used for in vivo experiments
were transfected with pBABE-puro-Luc vector and
selected with puromicin to obtain MCF-7/Pit-1-luc cells.
For luciferase reporter assay, MCF-7 cells were cultured
as described above, and 12–24 h before transfection
2 × 105 cells per well were seeded in 24-well plates and
allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then transfected
with the pCYP24A1-luc vector, pcDNA3, pcDNA3-Pit-1
and pGL3B-hBRCA1 constructs (pGL3B-hBRCA1−1520/+1,
pGL3B-hBRCA1−1086/+1, pGL3B-hBRCA1−652/+1, and the
mutant pGL3B- hBRCA11520/+1mutvector) using JetPEI
transfection reagent (PolyPlus Transfection, Illrich,
France). The proximal promoter regions of the human
BRCA1 gene constructs, and site-directed mutagenesis
was carried out as described in Supplemental

Animal studies
Twenty four female mice, age-matched
between  6–8  weeks, homozygous for the severe
combined immune deficiency spontaneous mutation
(CB17-Prkdcscid, named SCID, PRBB, Barcelona,
Spain) were used for xenografting studies. SCID
mice were injected subcutaneously into the left and
right flanks with 7×106 MCF-7/Pit-1-luc (24 mice, 48
tumors). Fifteen days after cells injection, mice were
randomized into 4 groups of 6 mice each. One group
was treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 3-Epi every
other day (0.5 μg/kg weight, dissolved in sesame oil).
Another group was treated only twice with cisplatin
(7 mg/kg weight, i.p., days 0 and 7 of treatment). A third
group was treated with 3-Epi every other day (i.p., 0.5
μg/kg weight) + cisplatin only twice (7 mg/kg weight,
i.p., days 0 and 7 of treatment). Finally, a control group
was treated with vehicle (sesame oil). Tumor growth
was monitored every 7 days from day 15 (0 day of
treatment) until day 36 (21 days of treatment) using
in Vivo Imaging System (IVIS, Caliper Life Sciences,
Alameda, USA), and tumor volume was calculated.
An intensity map was obtained using the Living Image
software (Caliper Life Sciences). The software uses a
color-based scale to represent the intensity of each pixel
(ranging from blue representing low to red representing
high).
Calcium levels were evaluated in male swiss CD-1
mice. Mice (5 per group) were injected intraperitoneally at
several doses (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, or 1 μg/kg weight) either with
1, 25D or 3-Epi dissolved in sesame oil every other day for
three weeks. Control group was injected with sesame oil.
Calcium in serum was determined using the QuantiChom
Calcium Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA,
USA). Calcium levels were also evaluated in the mice
xenograft tumor model after treatments.
