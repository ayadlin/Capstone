BACKGROUND: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is an active agent for the treatment of CD33-postive acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
and may improve the outcome of specific patient subgroups when combined with conventional chemotherapy. However, to the best
of the authors’ knowledge, the effects of GO on levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) are unknown. METHODS: Pediatric patients
with AML who received GO, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy on the AML02 multicenter trial, were analyzed to
determine the effects of GO on MRD and outcome. RESULTS: Among 17 patients who received GO alone because of persistent leukemia, 14 had a reduction in their MRD level and 13 became MRD negative. Of the 29 who received chemotherapy in combination with
GO after responding poorly to chemotherapy, 28 demonstrated reduced MRD and 13 became MRD negative. Treatment with GO
effectively reduced MRD before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and was not found to be associated with increased
treatment-related mortality after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: GO is effective in reducing MRD levels in pediatric patients with
C 2013 American
AML and may improve the outcome of those patients at high risk of disease recurrence. Cancer 2013;119:4036-43. V

INTRODUCTION
Significant progress has been made in the treatment of childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) over the past 40 years;
recent trials have resulted in overall survival (OS) estimates of > 60%.1-6 However, induction chemotherapy is still based
on the “3 1 7” regimen (daunorubicin for 3 days plus cytarabine for 7 days) developed in the 1980s,7 and to the best of
our knowledge no benefit has been demonstrated when daunorubicin is replaced with idarubicin or mitoxantrone3,8-10 or
when the dose of cytarabine is intensified.2 Although some studies have suggested that high-dose anthracyclines improve
rates of disease remission and OS, this effect has not been observed in all studies and has not yet been demonstrated in
childhood AML.11-13 Similar to induction therapy, postremission therapy has not changed dramatically since the benefit
of intensive high-dose cytarabine-based postremission chemotherapy was demonstrated in the 1980s and 1990s.14,15
Thus, recent improvements in treatment outcome most likely reflect improved supportive care, refinement of risk classification, the use of minimal residual disease (MRD) to monitor response to therapy, and improved hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) rather than the use of new agents. However, it appears unlikely that survival estimates of 70%
can be surpassed with currently available agents.
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is a humanized anti-CD33-calicheamicin conjugate that reportedly induced complete responses in approximately 30% of patients with recurrent AML,16-18 leading to its approval by the US Food and
Drug Administration in 2000.19 Although concerns regarding hepatic venoocclusive disease tempered early enthusiasm,20,21 subsequent studies have suggested that lower doses5,22,23 or fractionated doses24 of GO could be safely given in
combination with chemotherapy; these results have led to several randomized trials. An interim analysis of one such trial

(Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] 106) demonstrated a greater rate of early death in the GO treatment
arm, leading to the withdrawal of this agent in 2010.
Nevertheless, the results of other studies have suggested
that the judicious use of GO may improve clinical outcomes in selected subgroups of newly diagnosed
patients.25-27 Because of renewed interest in GO,28,29 we
now report our experience with this agent in the St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude) AML02 trial.2
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Therapy

Between 2002 and 2008, 232 children with de novo AML
(n 5 206), therapy-related or myelodysplastic syndromerelated AML (n 5 12), or mixed-lineage leukemia
(n 5 14) were enrolled in the AML02 trial.2 Flow cytometry assay based on aberrant antigen expression was used to
measure MRD and could detect 1 leukemia cell per 1000
mononuclear bone marrow cells (0.1%).2 MRD levels < 0.1% were considered negative. MRD values were
available for 203 patients after induction 1 and for 194
patients after induction 2.30
As previously described, patients were randomly
assigned to receive daunorubicin (at a dose of 50 mg/m2
on days 2, 4, and 6) and etoposide (at a dose of 100 mg/
m2 on days 2-6) plus either high-dose cytarabine (at a

dose of 3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5) or lowdose cytarabine (at a dose of 100 mg/m2 every 12 hours
on days 1-10) during induction 1.2 Bone marrow was
examined on day 22 to evaluate response to induction 1.
During induction 2, patients received low-dose cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide (ADE), alone or in
combination with 3 mg/m2 of GO. Initially, the combination of ADE and GO was used only in patients with
MRD levels > 25% after induction 1 because the use of
this combination in patients with AML had not been
reported when the study opened in 2002. Patients with an
MRD level  0.1% after induction 2 were given GO at a
dose of 6 mg/m2 as induction 3. Because the combination
of ADE and GO was well tolerated, the protocol was
amended in 2005 to give ADE plus GO as induction 2 to
patients with an MRD level  1% after induction 1 and
to eliminate the use of single-agent GO as induction 3.
Consolidation therapy was based on the initial risk classification and response to therapy.2 The study and the
amendments were approved by the Institutional Review
Board, and written informed consent or assent, as appropriate, was obtained for all patients.
Statistical Analysis

Event-free survival (EFS) was analyzed from either the
completion of induction 1 or the initiation of transplant

to disease resistance or recurrence, secondary malignancy,
removal from the study due to toxicity, or death; in the
absence of adverse events, data were censored at the time
of last follow-up. OS was also analyzed from the time of
completion of induction 1 or the initiation of transplant
to death, and data were censored at the time of last followup. The Kaplan-Meier method31 was used to estimate
EFS and OS and the exact log-rank test was used to compare EFS and OS. The exact chi-square test was used to
compare specific categories of MRD change (negative,
decreased but not negative, and increased) in those treated
with ADE plus GO versus ADE alone as induction 2. The
exact Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare MRD
levels after induction 1 in patients given the combination
of ADE and GO versus ADE alone as induction 2. The
data were not adjusted for multiple testing. Analyses were
performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC) for Windows.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

After 1 course of induction therapy, MRD levels were< 0.1% in 128 patients, 0.1% to 1% in 24 patients,
and > 1% in 51 patients (Fig. 1). All patients with MRD
levels < 1% received ADE as induction 2. Before the protocol amendment, patients with MRD levels > 25%
(n 5 9 patients) received ADE plus GO as induction 2,
whereas those with MRD levels of 1% to 25% received
4038

ADE alone (n 5 22 patients) (Fig. 1). In addition,
patients with an MRD level  0.1% after induction 2
were given GO as induction 3 (n 5 17 patients), except
those patients who had received the combination of ADE
and GO. After the amendment, patients with MRD levels
of 1% to 25% received the combination of ADE and GO
as induction 2 (n 5 20 patients) (Fig. 1) and GO was no
longer given as induction 3.
Seventeen patients received GO at a dose of 6 mg/m2
as a single agent and 29 received the combination of ADE
plus GO as induction 2 (Fig. 1). High-risk features predominated in both groups (Tables 1 and 2). Of the 17
patients who received GO alone, 10 had high-risk features
(5 had FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem duplication [FLT3-ITD], 4 had megakaryoblastic leukemia, and 1
had myelodysplastic syndrome-related AML) and only 1
had a favorable karyotype (t(8;21)) (Table 1). Similarly, the
29 patients who received the combination of ADE plus
GO included 10 patients with FLT3-ITD, 8 with other
high-risk features, and only 2 with the t(8;21) karyotype
(Table 2). Among patients with induction 1 MRD levels of
1% to 25%, initial characteristics did not differ significantly between those who received ADE (22 patients) and
those who received ADE plus GO (20 patients) (P 5 .75).

became MRD negative (Table 1). However, 3 patients (1
with megakaryoblastic leukemia, 1 with FLT3-ITD, and
1 with no high-risk features), all with CD33-positive leukemia, responded poorly, having higher levels of MRD after receiving GO.
Among the 29 patients who received the combination of ADE plus GO as induction 2, 28 had decreased
MRD levels after treatment. MRD became negative in 9
of 20 patients with an MRD level < 25% and in 4 of 9

nonresponder was a patient with CD33-positive, FLT3ITD-positive AML who had an MRD level of 42.3% after
induction 1 and 46.1% after receiving the combination of
ADE and GO.
Overall, 42 patients had MRD levels of 1% to 25%
after induction 1; 22 of these patients received ADE
(before the amendment) and 20 received ADE plus GO as
induction 2. Induction 1 MRD levels were significantly

higher in patients who received the combination of ADE
plus GO than in those who received ADE alone (median,
9.5% [range, 1.0%-24.7%] vs 2.9% [range, 1.4%16.0%]; P < .01). Among the 20 patients with MRD levels of 1% to 25% after induction 1 who received the combination of ADE plus GO, 9 (45%) became MRD
negative, 11 (55%) had a reduction of their MRD level
but remained MRD positive, and none had an increased

had a reduction in their MRD level but remained MRD
positive, and 4 patients (18%) had increased levels of
MRD (Fig. 1). The 5-year OS and EFS estimates from

significantly, among patients treated with the combination of ADE plus GO compared with patients who

not found to be significantly different in patients who
received GO (29.5% 6 9.1%) versus those who did not

Patients who underwent HSCT were analyzed to
identify any associations between GO exposure and
HSCT outcome. Among the 203 patients with evaluable
MRD levels after induction 1, 60 received HSCT in first
remission: 32 patients had no exposure to GO whereas 28
patients received GO either alone or in combination with
ADE. Although there was no difference noted in the percentage of patients with high-risk features in the 2 treatment groups (22 of 32 patients vs 20 of 28 patients;
P 5 1), patients who received GO had significantly higher
induction 1 MRD levels than those who did not receive
GO (median, 15.3% [range, 0%-34.7%] vs 0% [range,
0%-2.0%]; P < .001). However, pretransplant MRD levels did not appear to differ according to GO exposure
(P 5 .20). Moreover, the 5-year OS (53.3% 6 10.1% vs
62.5% 6 11.0%; P 5 .41) and EFS (49.1% 6 10.1% vs

differ significantly between patients who had versus those
who had not received prior GO treatment (Figs. 3A and
B). The cumulative incidence of disease recurrence was

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we directly tested the effect of GO
on leukemic cells by measuring MRD levels before and after treatment. As a single agent, GO reduced MRD levels
in 14 of 17 patients who had persistent leukemia after 2
courses of ADE. Because of the absence of safety data
regarding the combination of ADE plus GO when this
clinical trial opened, this combination was initially limited to patients who had MRD levels > 25% after induction 1. The combination of ADE plus GO was found to
be well tolerated and effectively reduced the MRD level in
8 of 9 patients, with 4 of these highly refractory cases
becoming MRD negative. The safety of ADE plus GO
led us to amend the AML02 trial to prescribe this combination for patients with MRD levels > 1%. Thus, we had
2 nonrandomized comparison cohorts: patients with
MRD levels of 1% to 25% after induction 1 who received
ADE as induction 2 before the amendment and similar
patients who received the combination of ADE plus GO
as induction 2 after the amendment. Although the initial
characteristics of these 2 groups were not different, those
who received the combination of ADE plus GO had
higher induction 1 MRD levels compared with those who
received ADE alone. Despite these differences, all 20
patients who received the combination of ADE plus GO
had a reduction in their MRD levels, whereas 4 of the 22
patients who received ADE alone had increased MRD levels. Although these results suggest that the combination of
ADE plus GO may be more active than ADE alone, these
results must be interpreted with caution because this was
not a randomized trial. Nevertheless, it is encouraging
that even with the predominance of high-risk features and
the presence of high MRD levels after induction 1, 55%
of patients who received ADE plus GO were long-term
survivors at the time of last follow-up.
Among patients who underwent HSCT, those who
received GO had significantly higher induction 1 MRD
levels compared with patients with no exposure to GO.
However, the use of GO, either alone or in combination
with ADE, contributed to reductions in MRD levels,
resulting in similar pretransplant MRD levels in the 2
groups. Because pretransplant MRD is an important

predictor of outcome,32 it is not surprising that the posttransplant OS and EFS rates were similar in the 2 groups.
In addition, the cumulative incidence of disease recurrence did not differ, nor did the incidence of death from
other causes. These results suggest that the administration
of GO to patients who have poor responses to conventional chemotherapy may improve their outcome by
reducing MRD levels before transplant without increasing
transplant-related mortality.
The observed safety and activity of the combination
of ADE plus GO in the context of this trial supported its
use in a subsequent trial5 by the Children’s Oncology
Group. Pharmacogenetic data from these trials suggest
that coding variants in CD33 may alter the efficacy of
GO; for example, homozygous TT (Val14Val) at the
rs12459419 variant was associated with a poor response
to GO.33,34 In addition, other studies have demonstrated
that GO is beneficial when combined with conventional
chemotherapy in specific patient subgroups.25-27 In the
Medical Research Council AML15 trial, in which 1113
patients were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy
with or without GO, patients with low-risk karyotypes
were found to have a significant survival advantage when
treated with GO, and patients at intermediate risk
Cancer

demonstrated a trend toward improved survival.25 Among
280 adults with AML who were randomly assigned to
chemotherapy with or without fractionated, low-dose GO
in the Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA)-0701
study, those who received GO had significantly lower rates
of disease recurrence and higher EFS and OS estimates
compared with those who received chemotherapy only.26
Similarly, in the Medical Research Council AML16 trial,
the addition of GO reduced the frequency of disease
recurrence and was found to improve survival in older
patients with AML.27 By contrast, in the Nordic Society of
Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO-AML)
2004 trial, in which patients were randomly assigned to
receive postconsolidation single-agent GO versus no further therapy, GO was not shown to affect rates of disease
recurrence or survival, suggesting that its optimal use may
be as a component of combination chemotherapy rather
than as a single agent.35 In the aforementioned trials, as
well as in the current study, GO was not associated with an
increased risk of fatal toxicity.
AML continues to be difficult to treat, with few
options available for patients with recurrent or refractory
disease. The results described in the current study suggest
that GO may be useful in 2 settings. First, the

combination of GO with conventional chemotherapy was
found to be active in patients with AML that was very refractory to conventional therapy alone. In addition, the
use of GO appeared to be beneficial in reducing MRD
levels before transplant, which may have improved the
outcome after transplant. Thus, there are likely to be subsets of patients for whom the benefits of GO therapy outweigh the potential adverse effects.36 Future studies
should aim to identify these subsets of patients and examine the extent to which GO improves their outcomes. Furthermore, the results of the AML02 trial, as well as other
recent clinical trials of GO, support the development of
other CD33-directed therapies in the treatment of
patients with AML. Indeed, preclinical studies of such
therapies have recently been reported.37,38
