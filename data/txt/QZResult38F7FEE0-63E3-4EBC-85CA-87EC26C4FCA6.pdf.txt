Truncated-ERBB2 isoforms (t-ERBB2s), resulting from receptor proteolysis or alternative translation of the ERBB2 mRNA, exist in a
subset of human breast tumors. t-ERBB2s lack the receptor extracellular domain targeted by therapeutic anti-ERBB2 antibodies and
antibody–drug conjugates, including trastuzumab, trastuzumab-DM1 and pertuzumab. In clinical studies, expression of t-ERBB2 in
breast tumors correlates with metastasis as well as trastuzumab resistance. By using a novel immuno-microarray method, we detect
a signiﬁcant t-ERBB2 fraction in 18 of 31 (58%) of immunohistochemistry (IHC)3 þ ERBB2 þ human tumor specimens, and further
show that t-ERBB2 isoforms are phosphorylated in a subset of IHC3 þ samples (10 of 31, 32%). We investigated t-ERBB2 biological
activity via engineered expression of full-length and truncated ERBB2 isoforms in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs),
including HMEC and MCF10A cells. Expression of p110 t-ERBB2, but not p95m (m ¼ membrane, also 648CTF) or intracellular ERBB2s,
signiﬁcantly enhanced cell migration and invasion in multiple cell types. In addition, only expression of the p110 isoform led to
human breast epithelial cell (HMLE) xenograft formation in vivo. Expression of t-ERBB2s did not result in hyperactivation of the
phosphoinositide kinase-3/AKT or mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in these cells; rather, phosphoproteomic
array proﬁling revealed attenuation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in p110-t-ERBB2expressing cells compared to controls. Short hairpin-mediated silencing of STAT5 phenocopied p110-t-ERBB2-driven cell migration
and invasion, while expression of constitutively active STAT5 reversed these effects. Thus, we provide novel evidence that (1)
expression of p110 t-ERBB2 is sufﬁcient for full transformation of HMEC, yielding in vivo xenograft formation, and (2) truncated p110
t-ERBB2 expression is associated with decreased phosphorylation of STAT5.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 20% of breast cancers (BCs) harbor ampliﬁcation of
the ERBB2 proto-oncogene, yielding overexpression of ERBB2
(HER2) receptor. Before advent of ERBB2-targeted therapies,
patients with ERBB2 þ tumors experienced poor clinical outcome.1,2 The humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab
(Herceptin) targets the extracellular domain (ECD) of full-length
p185-ERBB2 receptor, and has improved prognosis for many
patients with ERBB2 þ BC.3–7 However, only subsets of ERBB2 þ
patients respond to ﬁrst-line trastuzumab, and resistance to
trastuzumab therapy occurs frequently.5,8–10
Several truncated ERBB2 isoforms have been described in
human BC, arising via alternative mRNA translation and metalloproteinase cleavage.11,12 Membrane-localized t-ERBB2 isoforms
(t-ERBB2s) can activate AKT and mitogen-activated protein
signaling in BC cells;13,14 however, they lack the bulk of receptor
ECD (including the target epitope of trastuzumab) and may confer
trastuzumab resistance;15 indeed, patients with t-ERBB2 þ BC
exhibit impaired trastuzumab response.13,16 Furthermore, t-ERBB2

expression correlates with increased nodal involvement, and
t-ERBB2s are more frequently expressed in metastases than
primary tumors.17–19 Importantly, t-ERBB2 expression is
associated with shorter progression-free and overall survival of
metastatic BC patients, including those treated with
trastuzumab.16,18,20
Three t-ERBB2s have been described in clinical specimens and
ERBB2-ampliﬁed cell lines (Figure 1a): p110 (also referred to as
611CTF17), which arises by alternative translation of ERBB2 mRNA;
p95m (m ¼ membrane, also 648CTF), arising via proteolytic
cleavage of full-length receptor;21 importantly, both p110 and
p95m isoforms contain receptor transmembrane (TM) domain.
p95cyto (cytoplasmic, 687CTF), an isoform lacking TM domain, is
expressed in the cytoplasm.11,12 Finally, roles for ERBB2 isoforms in
cell nuclei have also been described.22–24
Clinical testing for ERBB2 overexpression frequently relies on an
intracellular domain-speciﬁc antibody (HercepTest; Dako, Carpenteria, CA, USA),25,26 and thus cannot distinguish between ERBB2
isoforms. If t-ERBB2 expression impacts trastuzumab response,

isoforms. p185, p110 and p95m isoforms contain transmembrane domain, whereas p95cyto lacks this domain. p95n is targeted to the nucleus
by the addition of two tandem nuclear localization sequence motifs on the C terminus. ECD, extracellular domain; TKD, tyrosine kinase

capture antibody (green). The first detector antibody (red) conjugated to GO binds to the captured target substrate using a different epitope
than the capture antibody. The second detector antibody (blue) conjugated to HRP binds to a third epitope and completes the formation of
the immuno-complex necessary for signal generation. GO, glucose oxidase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; P, phosphorylated residue.
(d) Detection of t-ERBB2 isoforms in BT474 cells using the CEER assay. Total protein lysate from 25 BT474 cells (left panel) or protein lysate from
250 BT474 cells from which p185 ERBB2 was removed with an ECD targeting antibody (right panel) were tested for the expression of ERBB2
using antibodies targeting both the ERBB2-ECD and ICD. Following removal of p185 ERBB2 (right panel), primarily t-ERBB2 isoforms are
present, which are detected with the ERBB2-ICD targeting antibody (red signal is near maximal signal), but not with an ECD targeting antibody
(light blue is close to the background signal). The image for post-p185 ERBB2 removed BT474 profile is shown at a higher photomultiplier tube
(Photo Multiplier Tube, hence higher background signal) gain set as the signal was almost non-detectable with the ERBB2-ECD antibody.
Utilizing BT474 lysates with and without p185ERBB2 removal and ICD capture configuration, the number of t-ERBB2 per cell were determined
to be B5.3  104 receptors per cell, compared to 1.2  106 total ERBB2 receptors per cell. Therefore, the percentage of t-ERBB2 in BT474 cells is
determined to be approximately 4.3% (13/300).

accurate measurement of t-ERBB2s may inﬂuence choice of
targeted therapy, for example, therapeutic antibodies vs kinase
inhibitors.13,16 Therefore, methods distinguishing full-length from
t-ERBB2s in a sensitive and speciﬁc manner are needed. Herein, we
demonstrate a novel antibody-microarray format, Collaborative
Enzyme Enhanced Reactive Immunoassay (CEER),27 to quantify
total and phosphorylated t-ERBB2s in human BC, using frozen
primary specimens and ﬁne-needle aspirate (FNA) metastatic
biopsies. This method is able to detect and discern full length vs

t-ERBB2s with a high degree of sensitivity, using minute amounts
of biopsied tumor material.
Having conﬁrmed t-ERBB2 expression in a clinical cohort, we
next investigated functional effects of t-ERBB2s in HMLEs.28,29
cDNAs encoding ERBB2 isoforms were stably expressed in human
mammary epithelial cell lines, HMLE, HME and MCF10A. t-ERBB2
effects on cells were investigated in vitro using soft agar colony

engraftment of HMLE cells expressing t-ERBB2s was investigated

combined immune deﬁciency mice.
The signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)
transcription factor has an important role in directing differentiation of both normal and transformed breast epithelial cells,30 and
ERBB receptors (including ERBB2) can regulate phosphorylation of
STAT5.31 Levels of phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5) are inversely
correlated with BC tumor stage, and pSTAT5 predicts favorable
outcome in patients.30,32 In vitro, pSTAT5 inhibits BC cell migration
and invasion, potentially explaining its association with favorable
prognosis.33 Herein, we report attenuation of pSTAT5
accompanying p110-t-ERBB2 expression in multiple BC cell types.

RESULTS
Detection of t-ERBB2s in BC
Full-length and t-ERBB2s are present in cultured BC cell lines
SKBR3 and BT474 (Figure 1b). In addition, t-ERBB2s exist in a
subset of ERBB2-ampliﬁed human BC.16–18 Thus, we sought to
conﬁrm the expression of t-ERBB2s in a cohort of BC specimens,
using a novel antibody-capture, proximity-based immunemicroarray platform34 (CEER; Figure 1c). This assay requires
immunocomplex formation between target-speciﬁc capture antibody and two detector antibodies (one conjugated to glucose
oxidase and one to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)) by binding to a
single target protein.27,35,36 As shown in Figure 1d, the assay
detects total and phosphorylated t-ERBB2 using lysates from as
few as 250 BT474 cells (see Materials and methods and
Supplementary Figure 1A). Comparison of differential ERBB2
proﬁling (with ERBB2-ECD and ERBB2-intracellular domain (ICD)
captures) of BT474 cells with and without the removal of fulllength p185-ERBB2 demonstrated that approximately 4.3% of the
total ERBB2 receptors were t-ERBB2s (or B5.3  104 t-ERBB2
receptors per cell) in this ERBB2-ampliﬁed cell line, with about
1.2  106 total ERBB2 receptors per cell. The enrichment of t-ERBB2
was efﬁcient, as removal of p185-ERBB2 from lysates prepared
from 250 BT474 cells yielded substantially lower signal with
ERBB2-ECD capture antibody, indicating that the signal in ERBB2ICD antibody capture is predominantly from t-ERBB2. Levels of
expression and phosphorylation of t-ERBB2s were determined by
comparing values of both capture antibodies on samples before
and after p185-ERBB2 clearance by immunoprecipitation. Standard curves of levels of total ERBB2 and phosphorylated ERBB2
were generated as references, using CEER analysis of the BT474
cell line (Supplementary Figure 2).
Frozen BC specimens from 74 patients were scored for ERBB2
levels using standard immunohistochemical analysis (HercepTest)
and then analyzed using CEER (Table 1 and Supplementary Table
S1). In all, 24 samples were ERBB2 low/negative (score ¼ 0–1 by
immunohistochemistry (IHC)), 19 were IHC score ¼ 2 and 31 had
high-level expression of ERBB2 (IHC score ¼ 3 þ ). The numbers
and percentages of samples harboring t-ERBB2 receptors in each
IHC group are summarized in Table 1. In this cohort, two IHC ¼ 0/1
specimens had detectable full-length ERBB2 above background,
but none had t-ERBB2 above background cutoff (p185 level below
300 000 RTK ng  1 was considered background based on CEER
measurement of ERBB2 in T47D non-ampliﬁed cell line). In all,
15.7% (3 of 19) of IHC2 ERBB2 þ tumors expressed t-ERBB2,
whereas 58% (18 of 31) of IHC3 þ ERBB2 þ tumors expressed
t-ERBB2. The association of t-ERBB2 expression with IHC3 þ score
was statistically signiﬁcant (IHC3 þ cohort compared to others,
Po0.001). Furthermore, detection via pan-antiphosphotyrosine
antibody revealed that t-ERBB2 isoforms were phosphorylated in
subsets of ERBB2 IHC2 tumors (11%, 2 of 19 samples) and IHC3 þ
tumors (32%, 10 of 31). IHC3 þ score was signiﬁcantly associated with detectable phosphorylated t-ERBB2 (IHC3 þ cohort
compared to others, Po0.005). CEER-ERBB2 proﬁling and

Tumor samples scored by IHC for ERBB2 expression were measured by
CEER for t-ERBB2 and phosphorylated t-ERBB2. The number and
percentage positive for t-ERBB2 and phospho-t-ERBB2 are provided.
IHC3 þ score significantly associates with the presence of total
(Po0.0001) and phosphorylated (Po0.005) t-ERBB2 (two-tailed Fisher’s

immunoprecipitation-western blot analyses of ERBB2 isoforms in
three individual tumor samples are provided in Figures 2a and b,
respectively (values for these samples are highlighted in red;
Supplementary Table S1). Supplementary Table S1 provides
t-ERBB2 quantiﬁcation for all 74 samples. Lastly, FNAs of
metastatic lesions from eight BC patients were analyzed. Three
samples of ERBB2 IHC þ metastases showed varying degrees of
total and phosphorylated t-ERBB2 (Table S2), whereas t-ERBB2
were not detected in IHC  metastases (not shown).
Engineered expression of t-ERBB2s
Having conﬁrmed t-ERBB2 expression and phosphorylation in
human BC specimens, we sought to determine their biological
effects in HMLEs. cDNAs encoding p185, p110, p95m and p95cyto
were stably expressed using pLXSN retroviral vector (Figure 3a). In
addition, a nuclear isoform (p95n) was constructed by adding two
tandem nuclear localization sequences to the p95cyto C terminus
(see Figure 1a). Importantly, parental HMLEs lack detectable
endogenous t-ERBB2s (Figure 3a). Expression of p185-ERBB2 was
used as positive control, while non-transduced and empty-vectortransduced cells served as negative controls in experiments. As
shown in Figure 3a, western blotting of HMLE lysates conﬁrmed
the expression of ERBB2 isoforms in each stable pool of cells.
While protein expression levels varied slightly, comparable levels
of p110 compared to p95m and p95cyto compared to p95n were
achieved in these pooled populations. HMLE-p110 cells also
express the p95cyto isoform due to alternate translation from the
downstream AUG codon corresponding to methionine 687 in the
ERBB2 peptide sequence (see Figure 3b, upper left panel);
however, we have also engineered a version of p110 t-ERBB2
with a mutated 687 methionine codon (M687G) to prevent
translation of p95cyto (see western blot; Supplementary
Figure 1B). This construct has yielded the same phenotypic effects
in cells as the original (data not shown). Although an unknown
lower molecular weight band does appear in the p185 lysates,
repeated blots indicate that p110 and p95 isoforms are not
expressed in the p185-transduced population (see Supplementary
Figure 1B).
Subcellular localization of ERBB2 isoforms
Alternative translation of ERBB2 mRNA is responsible for the
generation of p110 (CTF611) t-ERBB2.12 This isoform lacks an
N-terminal leader peptide to facilitate canonical membrane
protein trafﬁcking.17 We investigated subcellular localization of
this isoform using two complementary methods, western blots of
cell protein fractions (Figure 3b) and immunoﬂuorescence

Figure 2. Detection of ERBB2 isoforms in primary human breast tumor samples. (a) CEER analysis of human tumor samples reveals the
presence and phosphorylation of t-ERBB2s. Lysates of tumors from three patients with high (no. 26811) or intermediate (nos. 24913 and
25882) ERBB2 expression as scored by IHC were tested. Assay configuration is illustrated below the CEER panels. Antibodies were arrayed in
triplicate at three concentrations. Left panel antibodies for total p185 ERBB2 assay: control IgG (pink arrows), ECD-ERBB2 (yellow arrows) and
cytokeratin (CK, green arrows). Center and right panel antibodies for total and phosphorylated t-ERBB2 assay: control IgG (pink arrows), ECDERBB2 (yellow arrows), ICD-ERBB2 (dark and light blue arrows) and phosphorylated ERBB2 (red arrows). Before t-ERBB2 CEER assay (center and
right panels), full-length p185 ERBB2 was removed with an N-terminal ECD-directed antibody. (b) Western blot analysis of ERBB2 isoforms in
human breast tumor samples with varying levels of ERBB2 (by IHC) assayed in part (a). Patient specimen lysates 26811, 24913 and 25882 were
probed with antibody against ICD-ERBB2. Patient 26811 with positive western analysis also showed high level of ERBB2 as well as t-ERBB2
expression by CEER, with the use of much less cell lysate. Using CEER configuration, a quantitative detection of full-length ERBB2 and t-ERBB2
was achieved in samples (24913 and 25882) with IHC2 þ status. Of note, t-ERBB2 was not detected by western blot analysis in these samples.
Furthermore, a robust phosphorylation of t-ERBB2 was observed in patient 26811, whereas lower level was detected in patient 24913.

confocal microscopy (Figure 3c). p185, p110 and p95m receptors
(those harboring TM domain) were localized to cell membranes.
The p95m cDNA used in this study also lacks a canonical
N-terminal leader peptide, yet this isoform also resides in the
plasma membrane. Thus, it is apparent that the TM domain is
sufﬁcient to drive plasma membrane localization of p110 t-ERBB2.
In contrast, p95cyto existed predominantly in the cytoplasm,
whereas engineered nuclear isoform p95n was predominantly
localized to the nucleus (this image is at  2 higher magniﬁcation

to enhance detail). Because of the loss of protein during the
extraction method for fractionation, some signal is lost for p185
ERBB2 in the p110 and p95m lanes.
p110-t-ERBB2 enhances cell migration and invasion in vitro
Expression of t-ERBB2 has been previously associated with
increased nodal involvement and metastasis,18 suggesting a role
for t-ERBB2s in the pathophysiology of BC migration and invasion.

HMLE cells were probed with anti-ERBB2 antibody in a western blot assay. Actin was blotted as loading control. (b) Recombinant HMLE cells
were fractionated into cytoplasmic ‘C’, membrane ‘M’ and nuclear ‘N’ fractions, followed by western blotting for ERBB2. Control antibodies
identify proteins restricted to the cytoplasm (GAPDH, actin), the plasma membrane (NaK-ATPase) and the nucleus (Lamin A/C). p110 HMLE
also express the p95cyto isoform due to translation from the AUG codon corresponding to methionine 687. (c) Confocal microscopy of
recombinant HMLE cells. Plasma membranes were stained with concanavalin A (green), followed by a mouse anti-ERBB2 antibody and antimouse Cy5 (red) for receptor labeling. p185, p110 and p95m reside primarily in the plasma membrane, whereas p95cyto and p95n reside in
the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. Images are representative of the population at large and were taken at  80 magnification on a Zeiss
confocal microscope. Cells expressing p95n were analyzed at higher magnification to confirm nuclear localization.

Therefore, we analyzed effects of t-ERBB2s using in vitro migration
and invasion assays. As shown in Figure 4a, p110 expression
enhanced migration of HMLEs compared to p185 ERBB2 (p110
compared to p185, P ¼ 0.04). While p95m increased migration
compared to parental and empty-vector HMLEs, its effect was not
signiﬁcant compared to p185. Neither p95cyto nor p95n
signiﬁcantly affected cell migration. To rule out cell type- or
population-speciﬁc effects, we also determined effects of p185
and p110 expression in HME and MCF10A cells. p110 t-ERBB2 also
signiﬁcantly increased migration of HME cells (Figure 4c) compared to p185. MCF10A migration was also enhanced by the
expression of p110 compared to p185 (mean number of cells per
ﬁeld ¼ 464 (p110) vs 182 (p185), P ¼ 0.004 (Student’s t-test)).
Invasion assays using Matrigel-coated ﬁlters (Figure 4b)
revealed that p110 and p95m isoforms increased HMLE invasion
compared to parental and vector control cells (p110 vs controls,
P ¼ 0.001; p95m vs controls, P ¼ 0.003); however, only p110
signiﬁcantly increased invasion compared to p185-expressing
cells (P ¼ 0.03). p110-expressing HME cells were also more invasive
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

than p185-expressing cells (Figure 4d). Importantly, the differences seen in these assays were not due to enhanced proliferation
by subsets of cells, as there was no signiﬁcant difference in the
proliferation rate of HMLE cells expressing the different isoforms
within the 36 h window of this assay (Supplementary Figure 3C).
In addition, the ability of HMLEs expressing different isoforms of
ERBB2 to form colonies in soft agar was assayed. The number of
colonies formed by HMLEs signiﬁcantly increased with the
expression of membrane-bound isoforms p185 (P ¼ 0.0001),
p95m (P ¼ 0.003) and p110-ERBB2 (P ¼ 0.0001) when compared
to vector control cells; however, this effect was not elicited by
intracellular t-ERBB2 species (Supplementary Figure 3A).
p110 t-ERBB2 promotes HMLE xenograft formation

promoting primary breast tumor formation.17 Thus, we

STAT5 phosphorylation is attenuated by p110-t-ERBB2 expression
On the basis of our in vitro and in vivo observations, we sought a
biological basis for p110-driven phenotypes. Unexpectedly, we did
not observe signiﬁcant changes in phosphorylation of MEK1/2,
ERK1/2 or AKT signaling proteins in p110- compared to p185expressing HMLE cells when examined by western blotting or CEER
(data not shown), in contrast to a published study using
engineered expression in MCF7 cells.14 In addition, there was no
signiﬁcant proliferation rate difference between the HMLE
populations (Supplementary Figure 3b). To determine potential
mechanisms by which p110 t-ERBB2 elicits phenotypes distinct
from p185, we used the Proteome Proﬁler array (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA; no. ARY003) to examine phosphorylation of
multiple signaling proteins in HMLE cells. Analysis revealed

decreased phosphorylation of STAT5 in HMLE cells expressing
p110 isoform, compared to p185-expressing and control HMLE
cells (Supplementary Figure 3B). Densitometric analysis revealed
approximately twofold reduction of pSTAT5 by this method.
Moreover, western blotting veriﬁed loss of pSTAT5 in p110expressing HMLE cells (Figure 6a), and CEER measurement
conﬁrmed approximate twofold decrease of pSTAT5 in p110-HMLE
compared to p185-HMLE (data not shown). pSTAT5 was also
decreased in an independent p110-expressing cell line, HME, when
compared to expression of p185 ERBB2 (Figure 6b), ruling out
population- and cell-type-speciﬁc effects. Loss of pSTAT5 has
previously been associated with increased tumor grade and poor
clinical outcome in human BC30,32 (see Discussion). To conﬁrm that
the decrease in pSTAT5 was sufﬁcient to effect STAT5-dependent
gene transcription, we analyzed levels of the STAT5-responsive
gene p21WAF1/CIP1. p21 protein was decreased in p110-expressing
HMLE cells compared to p185 and control HMLE cells (Figure 6c).
To determine if decreased pSTAT5 is sufﬁcient to elicit
phenotypes similar to those elicited by p110, we transduced

Figure 6d, HMLE cells transduced with shRNA virus have reduced
expression of STAT5 protein, compared to control cells with
transduced with non-silencing control shRNA. Importantly, STAT5silenced HMLE cells exhibited enhanced migration (Figure 6e, left
panels) and invasion (Figure 6e, right panels) when compared to
control cells using transwell assays in vitro, mimicking phenotypes
observed in p110-t-ERBB2-expressing cells. To conﬁrm the role of
pSTAT5 loss in the migration and invasion driven by p110
expression, we expressed a constitutively active mutant form of
STAT5b (STAT5b1*6) in HMLE cells also expressing p110 t-ERBB2.
Expression of constitutively active STAT5b in p110 HMLE reversed
the p110-driven migratory (Figure 7a) and invasive phenotypes
(Figure 7b).
DISCUSSION
Routine clinical testing of BC does not currently assess the
expression of t-ERBB2 vs p185-ERBB2.37 Although t-ERBB2s may
confer resistance to trastuzumab therapy, ERBB2 kinase inhibitors
Oncogene (2013) 2463 – 2474

including lapatinib inhibit the activity of t-ERBB2s.38 Therefore,
sensitive methods to accurately and reliably measure expression
of t-ERBB2s in BC are needed, and could potentially impact choice
of anti-ERBB2 therapy.
Recently, t-ERBB2 levels in clinical samples have been assessed
by antibody-based VeraTag assay.16 This method requires
formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded tissue that may alter
antigenicity due to ﬁxation and antigen retrieval procedures.
Therefore, detection of minor t-ERBB2 variants against the
background of predominant full-length ERBB2 proteins can be
challenging.
In contrast, CEER utilizes tissues (FNA or biopsy) without
ﬁxation, thus minimizing the probability of antigen modiﬁcation
during processing. Full-length ERBB2 proteins present in sample
lysate are removed immunomagnetically using an antibody
against the ECD of ERBB2 (as shown in Supplementary
Figure 1A), followed by detection of t-ERBB2 variants using three
different ICD antibodies. This conﬁguration combined with the
superior sensitivity of the proximity-mediated platform allows
minute amounts of t-ERBB2 to be efﬁciently detected and
quantiﬁed.

In a cohort of ERBB2 þ BC, 11% (2 of 19) of IHC2 þ tumors
expressed t-ERBB2 and 52% (16 of 31) of IHC3 þ tumors expressed
t-ERBB2. Furthermore, t-ERBB2 isoforms were phosphorylated in
IHC3 þ tumors (32%, 10 of 31) and a minority of IHC2 tumors (11%,
2 of 19 samples). An IHC 3 þ score was signiﬁcantly associated
with expression (Po0.0001) and phosphorylation (Po0.005) of
t-ERBB2s when compared to IHC 0/1 and 2 groups. In several
samples, t-ERBB2s accounted for 10–20% of total ERBB2 receptors
per cell, revealing a signiﬁcant fraction of t-ERBB2s in these
specimens (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1).17 Moreover,
t-ERBB2s were detectable in FNA samples of metastatic lesions
from several patients (Supplementary Table S2), suggesting
potential clinical application of this technology in monitoring
therapeutic response or progression of metastatic disease.
To examine effects of t-ERBB2 expression in human breast cells,
isoforms were stably expressed in HMLE, HME and MCF10A cells.
We conﬁrm association of p110 t-ERBB2 with the plasma
membrane, despite lack of a leader peptide sequence. Only the
membrane-bound isoforms of ERBB2 (p185, p110 and p95m)
elicited signiﬁcant phenotypes in the invasion, migration and soft
agar colony formation assays used in this study. It is important to
note that we chose to analyze the effect(s) of each t-ERBB2 alone;
it is possible that in ERBB2-ampliﬁed BC, there exists a mixed
population of different isoforms of the receptors that yield other
phenotypes. Although p185, p110 and p95m had similar effects
on soft agar colony formation by HMLEs, p110 consistently and
signiﬁcantly enhanced HMLE and HME migration and invasion
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

when compared to p185.17,39 To rule out cell-type-speciﬁc effects,
we also conﬁrmed increased migration driven by p110 in MCF10A
cells. Finally, only the expression of p110-t-ERBB2 led to HMLE
xenograft formation in vivo. Consistent with our data, p110-ERBB2
transgenic mice develop mammary adenocarcinomas with a
shorter latency than those in p185-ERBB2 transgenic animals.17
Combined, these data indicate that p110 t-ERBB2 is highly
tumorigenic compared to p185 and other isoforms,40 identifying
p110 as a potential therapeutic target in ERBB2 þ BC.
Unexpectedly, expression of t-ERBB2s did not result in
hyperactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase or AKT
signaling pathways, as was described in MCF7 cells.14
Importantly, MCF7 are a fully transformed human cell line with
an activating mutation in PI3KCA (among other genetic
alterations), possibly explaining the differences in our
observations using partially transformed HMLE cells. Rather,
p110 t-ERBB2 led to decreased pSTAT5 when compared to p185
ERBB2, in both HME and HMLE cells.
The role of STAT5 in human BC is currently controversial and
not fully understood. Activated STAT5 may promote survival and
antiapoptotic signaling in mammary cells, contributing to initial
neoplastic transformation. However, the presence of pSTAT5 is
inversely correlated with BC tumor stage.32 STAT5 is involved in
differentiation of breast epithelium; thus, tumors with high
pSTAT5 tend to be well-differentiated and have more favorable
prognostic characteristics compared to those lacking pSTAT5,30
implying a role for STAT5 in the pathophysiology of BC.
Accordingly, silencing of STAT5 in HMLE cells led to increased
cell migration and invasion, mimicking p110 t-ERBB2 phenotypes,
while expression of constitutively active STAT5 reversed p110driven migration and invasion. Deregulation of STAT5 signaling
has been implicated in motility, invasion and metastasis of BC
cells.33,41 Taken together, our data offer a mechanism by which
p110 t-ERBB2 may augment malignant phenotypes such as
migration and invasion, namely via perturbation of STAT5
signaling. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanism by
which p110 t-ERBB2 exerts effects on STAT5 phosphorylation is an
active area of research in our laboratory.
In summary, these data implicate p110-t-ERBB2 as a potential
driver of tumorigenesis, migration and invasion of human
mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), thus extending observations
from fully transformed BC cell lines and transgenic mice.
Perturbation of STAT5 signaling by p110 t-ERBB2 represents a
newly identiﬁed mechanism of t-ERBB2 activity in human mammary
cells. t-ERBB2s may be drivers of ERBB2 þ BC pathogenesis, and
could serve as biomarkers identifying patients that may differentially beneﬁt from anti-ERBB2 therapies (monoclonal antibodies
(Abs) vs TKIs).16,42 As shown here, the speciﬁc and sensitive CEER
detection method is able to detect and quantify t-ERBB2 isoforms in
human breast tumor samples using minute amounts of clinical
material, including metastasis samples. Accurate clinical
measurement of t-ERBB2 expression in human tumors may help
to guide appropriate ERBB2-targeted therapeutic approaches.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Multiplexed-microarray printing
Capture Abs were printed on nitrocellulose-coated glass slides (ONCYTE;
Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR, USA) using non-contact printers (Nanoplotter,
GeSiM); spot diameters were approximately 175 mm. Slides were kept in
desiccated chambers at 4 1C. Spots included tracking dye and speciﬁc
capture Abs. Approximately 500 pl of capture Abs were printed in triplicate
and serial dilution concentrations of 1, 0.5 and 0.25 mg ml  1. Puriﬁed
mouse-IgGs served as negative controls.

Antibody conjugation
Target-speciﬁc Abs and detector enzymes, glucose oxidase or HRP,
were activated with bi-functional crosslinker, succinimidyl-4-(NOncogene (2013) 2463 – 2474

maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, and coupled making
antibody–enzyme conjugates.35,36 Conjugates were high performance
liquid chromatography puriﬁed. Ab activities in puriﬁed conjugates were
determined by competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme
activities were detected by functional assays speciﬁc for detector enzymes.

CEER34
Immuno-microarray slides were rinsed twice with TBST (50 mM Tris/150 mM
NaCl/0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.2–7.4), blocked with 80 ml Whatman blocking
buffer for 1 h at room temperature (RT), and then washed 2  with TBST.34
Serially diluted lysate controls in 80 ml dilution buffer (2% bovine serum
albumin/0.1% Triton X-100/TBS, pH 7.2–7.4) and samples were added to
designated subarrays on slides, and then incubated for 1 h at RT. Slides
were washed 4  for 3 min, detector Abs were added in 80 ml reaction
buffer and incubated for 2 h at RT. After TBST wash to remove unbound
detector Abs, 80 ml of biotin-tyramide solution (5 mg ml  1 in 50 mM
glucose/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) prepared from 400 mg ml  1 in
ethanol solution (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) was added and
incubated for 15 min in darkness. The covalent coupling of the highly
reactive, short-lived biotin-tyramide radicals to nucleophilic redisues in the
proximity of interaction sites causes local deposition of biotinylated
tyramide. Subsequent incubation with ﬂuorescently labeled streptavidin
generates signals that can be captured by ﬂuorescence microarray scanner
for visualization and quantitation. Glucose-oxidase/HRP-mediated tyramide
signal ampliﬁcation process was terminated by washing with TBST 4  ,
3 min each. Local deposition of biotin-tyramide was detected by
incubation with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen, Grand Island,
NY, USA) at 0.5 mg ml  1 in 2% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Triton/TBS for
40 min. Upon completion of incubation, slides were washed 4  with TBST,
dried and kept in darkness until imaged via microarray scanner.

t-ERBB2 enrichment
Full-length p185-ERBB2 receptors were cleared from lysates using
magnetic-bead-coupled antibodies speciﬁc to ECD of ERBB2. Resulting
p185-ERBB2 depleted lysates, which contained t-ERBB2 receptor proteins
lacking the ECD, were used for subsequent quantiﬁcation of t-ERBB2
expression and phosphorylation.

Clinical samples
Flash-frozen BC tissues were obtained from subjects with invasive ductal
carcinoma, stages II or III (ILS Bio, Chestertown, MD, USA). Baseline ERBB2IHC status was available for all samples. Flash-frozen tissue samples were
lysed in 100 ml lysis buffer, kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged. Protein
concentrations of supernatants determined by BCA protein assay kit
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and stored at  80 1C before analysis. FNA
samples were collected according to an IRB-approved protocol from
subjects with progressive, measurable metastatic stage IIIB or stage IV BC.
Subjects had histologically or cytologically conﬁrmed invasive BC. FNA
samples were collected using G23-gauge needles. FNA samples were
immediately injected into vials containing lysis buffer and shipped
overnight for subsequent analysis.

used to determine statistical signiﬁcance when comparing the number of
positive samples in the IHC3 group vs IHC0/1 and IHC2 groups.

IP-western blotting
Cell lysates were incubated with magnetic bead-conjugated antibodies
against intracellular domain of ERBB2 overnight at 4 1C. Immunomagnetically enriched lysates were resuspended in sample buffer containing bmercaptoethanol, boiled 5 min, cooled to RT and loaded onto NuPage
(Invitrogen) 4–12% gel. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, washed, blocked with 5% milk and incubated with 11
then 21 Abs before detection process using nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.

Cells and culture
HMLE, HME and MCF10A cells were cultured in mammary epithelial growth
medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 1C.
Cells stably transduced with pLXSN vector encoding recombinant ERBB2
isoforms were selected using 0.5 mg ml  1 (HME and HMLE) or
0.75 mg ml  1 G418 (MCF10A), and were kept as pooled populations.
HMLE p110 cells with added pLVX-puro constructs were selected by the
addition of 0.5 mg ml  1 puromycin. BT474 and SKBR3 cells were cultured in
RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For proliferation
assays, 2500 HMLE cells were seeded in triplicate wells of 24-well plates.
Cells were trypsinized and counted 24 and 72 h later using a Coulter Z1
counter.

Cloning and vectors
ERBB2 cDNAs were expressed using pLXSN retroviral vector. p185, p110,
p95cyto and p95m were cloned using endogenous start codons from
ERBB2 mRNA sequence, whereas an AUG start codon was engineered to
initiate translation of p95m. Recombinant pLXSN vectors were packaged
using Phoenix cells, virus was harvested, followed by HMLE transduction.
Constitutively active STAT5b (STAT5b1*6) was cloned and expressed using
pLVX-puro vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) via similar
techniques. GIPZ shRNA lentiviral vectors targeting STAT5 (Open
Biosystems). Lentiviral particles were produced by cotransfection of GIPZ
vector DNA with packaging plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2 in 293 T cells.
Viruses were harvested and used to transduce HMLE cells using standard
techniques.

Immunoﬂuorescence confocal microscopy
HMLEs were grown on coverslips to B50% conﬂuence, washed with PBS
and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT. Slides were stained
using concanavalin-A-Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen; C11252) diluted in PBS
for 30 min at RT, followed by PBS wash. After permeabilization with Triton
X-100, anti-ERBB2 antibody (3B5; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; AB16901)
was applied in 5% bovine serum albumin-PBS for 1 h at RT, followed by
anti-mouse Cy5-conjugated antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for
30 min. Coverslips were washed, mounted on microslides and imaged
using Zeiss confocal microscope, followed by the AxioVision software
processing.

CEER data analysis

Subcellular fractionation and western blotting

Slides were scanned at three photomultiplier tubes gain settings to
increase effective dynamic range. Background-corrected signal intensities
were averaged from spots printed in triplicate. The relative ﬂuorescence
value of the respective reagent blank was subtracted from each sample.
Several criteria were used to ﬁlter data from further analyses, including
limits on spot footprints, coefﬁcient of variation for spot replicates, overall
pad background and intensity of reagent blank. For each assay, a standard
curve was generated from serially diluted BT474 lysates. Data were ﬁt to a
ﬁve-parameter equation derived as a function of capture–antibody
concentration and photomultiplier tubes. Each curve was plotted as a
function of log signal intensity, measured as relative ﬂuorescence unit
(RFU) vs log concentration of cell lysates and referenced to the standard
cell line, BT474. Individual predictions from each dilution and gain were
averaged into a single, ﬁnal prediction.

HMLEs were fractionated using QProteome cell-compartment kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA; no. 37502) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
SKBR3 and BT474 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Lysates were run on
4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, probed with anti-ERBB2 antibody (AB16901, 3B5; Abcam), anti-NaKpump antibody (ab7671; Abcam), anti-lamin A/C antibody (sc-7293; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin HRP antibody (Abcam) or anti-GAPDH
antibody (ab9482; Abcam) for fraction controls. Blots were developed
using standard chemiluminescence techniques.
For STAT5 and p21 western blots, total protein lysates from HMLE and
HME cells were used in techniques similar to above, and probed with
antiphospho-STAT5 Y699 antibody (antibody 5G4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA; no. sc-81524) or anti-p21 antibody (no. sc-397).

staining, numbers of visible colonies were counted. Experiments were
performed in triplicate, and one-way analysis of variance was used to
determine signiﬁcance.

Invasion and migration assays
In all, 50 000 serum-starved HMLEs were seeded into upper chambers of
transwells (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA). For invasion assays, ﬁlters
were overlaid with Matrigel. Media containing 20% fetal bovine serum was
added to lower chambers as chemoattractant. After 24 h (migration) or
36 h (invasion), cells on top of ﬁlters were scraped away; ﬁlters were ﬁxed
with methanol and stained with crystal violet. Filters were mounted on
microslides, images were taken at  10 magniﬁcation using light
microscopy. Migrating/invading cells were counted for each well.
Experiments were performed in triplicate, and one-way analysis of variance
and Student’s t-tests were used to determine signiﬁcance.

In vivo methods
Mammary fat pads 4 and 9 of female non-obese diabetic/severe combined
immune deﬁciencymice were injected with 3  106 HMLE cells: parental
(group 1); vector control (g2); p185-ERBB2 (g3); p110-t-ERBB2 (g4); p95m-tERBB2 (g5); p95cyto-t-ERBB2 (g6); p95n-t-ERBB2 (g7); and hRAS (g8). Six
mice per group were injected, yielding 12 potential xenografts per group.
Xenograft formation and growth was monitored until reaching 5% of
bodyweight, or for a maximum of 150 days. Cells were injected in 200 ml of
1:1 (v v  1) mix of Matrigel/CollagenI. Work was performed following
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.
