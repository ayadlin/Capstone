ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate of all gynecological cancers
with a high recurrence rate. It is important to understand the nature of recurring
cancer cells to terminally eliminate ovarian cancer. The winged helix transcription
factor Forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) has been reported to function as either oncogene
or tumor-suppressor in various cancers. In the current study, we show that FOXP1
promotes cancer stem cell-like characteristics in ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown
of FOXP1 expression in A2780 or SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells decreased spheroid
formation, expression of stemness-related genes and epithelial to mesenchymal
transition-related genes, cell migration, and resistance to Paclitaxel or Cisplatin
treatment, whereas overexpression of FOXP1 in A2780 or SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells
increased spheroid formation, expression of stemness-related genes and epithelial to
mesenchymal transition-related genes, cell migration, and resistance to Paclitaxel or
Cisplatin treatment. In addition, overexpression of FOXP1 increased promoter activity
of ABCG2, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, among which the increases in ABCG2, OCT4,
and SOX2 promoter activity were dependent on the presence of FOXP1-binding site.
In xenotransplantation of A2780 ovarian cancer cells into nude mice, knockdown of
FOXP1 expression significantly decreased tumor size. These results strongly suggest
FOXP1 functions as an oncogene by promoting cancer stem cell-like characteristics in
ovarian cancer cells. Targeting FOXP1 may provide a novel therapeutic opportunity
for developing a relapse-free treatment for ovarian cancer patients.

in ovarian cancer is very important in order to improve
clinical outcomes.
Previous studies reported that ovarian cancer
contained a small fraction of cells that exhibited
enhanced tumor initiating potential and stem cell-like
properties, thus called cancer stem cells (CSCs) [3–5].
CSCs derived from ovarian cancer are characterized by
their self-renewing capability, high tumorigenicity, and
resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [6]. CSCs
have been suggested as the cause of tumor metastasis
and tumor relapse because patients with residual ovarian
CSCs ultimately acquire chemoresistance after standard
combination of surgery and chemotherapy [7, 8].

INTRODUCTION
Among all gynecologic cancers, ovarian cancer
is a highly fatal disease and a major contributor to
cancer-related death in women [1]. Ovarian cancers are
asymptomatic or show vague symptoms in the early stage,
thus most ovarian cancers are detected at advanced stages
after cancer has spread beyond the primary tumor site [2].
The standard treatment for ovarian cancer is based on
the combination of surgery and chemotherapy. However,
the relapse rate is high after cytoreductive surgery and
systemic chemotherapy. Therefore, understanding the
mechanism of metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy

CSCs have also been reported to exhibit epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances motility
and invasiveness of cancer cells [9]. However, the
molecular mechanisms involved in the contribution of
CSCs to chemoresistance and relapses in ovarian cancer
have not been clearly identified. Therefore, molecular
understanding of CSC characteristics in ovarian cancer
is of critical importance in development of relapse-free
treatment for ovarian cancer patients.
The winged helix transcription factor Forkhead box
P1 (FOXP1) is one of four members of the subfamily P in
the FOX transcription factor family. FOXP transcription
factor is widely expressed and plays a key role in
development of the brain, heart, and lung in mammals.
Embryonic stem cell-specific isoform of FOXP1 is known
to stimulate the expression of transcription factor genes
required for maintaining pluripotency, such as OCT4,
NANOG, NR5A2, and GDF3 [10]. In cancer cells,
FOXP1 has been suggested as both a potential oncogene
and tumor suppressor depending on the cellular context.
High expression of FOXP1 in B cell lymphoma or
hepatocellular carcinoma was shown to play a role as an
oncogene, showing correlation with the worse outcome
[11, 12]. On the other hand, loss of FOXP1 expression
was reported in renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, lung
cancer, and endometrial cancer, with an association with
the worse outcome [13–17]. However, in ovarian cancer,
the precise role of FOXP1 in CSCs has not been clearly
characterized.
In this study, we explored the role of FOXP1
in ovarian cancer by examining the effects of FOXP1
expression on ovarian cancer cells. FOXP1 expression
in ovarian CSCs showed functional correlation with CSC
characteristics including spheroid formation, proliferation,
migration, EMT, and drug resistance. In addition,
overexpression of FOXP1 led to up-regulated expression
of ABCG2, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 genes. These
results strongly suggest that FOXP1 plays a role as an
oncogene in ovarian cancer and may be a valuable target
for development of therapeutics for treatment of CSCs in
ovarian cancer.

showed steady growth over time until day 20. Expression
of FOXP1 was analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting
on day 5, 10, 15, and 20 of spheroid culture. Expression
of FOXP1 at mRNA level and protein level started to
increase significantly on day 15 and further increased
on day 20 (Figure 1B and 1C). When spheroids were
subjected to immunocytochemistry analysis, FOXP1
expression increased along with the transcription factor
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) inside spheroids
(Figure 1D). To evaluate if hypoxia contributes to
expression of FOXP1, A2780 spheroid cells were treated
with Deferoxamine Mesylate/desferal (DFO) or cobalt
chloride, which have been known to increase expression
of HIF-1α [18]. Treatment of A2780 cells with DFO or
cobalt chloride led to increased expression of not only
HIF-1α but also FOXP1 (Figure 1E and 1F). These results
indicate a correlation of expression level of FOXP1 with
development of spheroids and hypoxia in A2780 ovarian
cancer cells.

FOXP1 promotes the spheroid formation of
ovarian cancer cells
To determine whether FOXP1 is involved in
the regulation of CSC-like characteristics, we tested
the effect of FOXP1 knockdown or overexpression
on spheroid formation in A2780 and SKOV3 ovarian
cancer cells. Knockdown of FOXP1 expression by
infecting A2780 cells or SKOV3 cells with lentiviral
shRNA against FOXP1 resulted in dramatically reduced
size of spheroids in comparison with control spheroids
(Figure 2A and 2B and Supplementary Figure 1). By
contrast, A2780 cells or SKOV3 cells infected with
viruses containing overexpression construct of FOXP1
generated noticeably larger spheroids (Figure 2A and
2B and Supplementary Figure 1). When the numbers
of spheroids generated from A2780 cells were counted,
A2780 cells with FOXP1 knockdown showed a
significant decrease in spheroid numbers, whereas A2780
cells with FOXP1 overexpression showed a significant
increase in spheroid numbers compared with those from
control A2780 cells (Figure 2C). When the number of
cells per spheroid was counted, spheroids from FOXP1silenced A2780 cells showed dramatically fewer cells,
whereas spheroids from FOXP1-overexpressing A2780
cells showed a significant increase in cell number
(Figure 2D). These results indicate that FOXP1 plays
a regulatory role in formation of spheroids from A2780
ovarian cancer cells.

RESULTS
FOXP1 expression increases during spheroid
culture of ovarian cancer cells
To determine whether expression of FOXP1 is
related to development of CSCs in ovarian cancer, the
expression levels of FOXP1 during the spheroid culture
of A2780 ovarian cancer cells were evaluated. When
A2780 cells were dissociated into single cells and seeded
into culture plates with a non-adhesive coating, spheroids,
known to contain the enriched CSC population [6],
appeared after 5-10 days of culture (Figure 1A). Spheroids

after FOXP1 knockdown or FOXP1 overexpression.
As shown in Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 2A,
FOXP1 knockdown decreased expression of stemnessrelated genes including OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and
ADLH1A1 in A2780 cells and SKOV3 cells. On the
contrary, overexpression of FOXP1 showed up-regulation
of stemness- or CSC-related genes including OCT4,
SOX2, KLF4, NANOG, ALDH1A1, and BMI-1 compared

with control spheroid cells (Figure 3A and Supplementary

from A2780 spheroid cells and subjected to Western
blotting analysis. As shown in Supplementary Figure 3,
strong expressions of FOXP1 and ALDH1A were detected
in non-isolated spheroid cells and ALDHhigh cells, but not
in ALDHlow cells. These results suggest that expression of

FOXP1 in ovarian cancer cells is required for maintaining
and inducing expression of stemness- or CSC-related
genes.
To evaluate the effect of FOXP1 expression on
EMT of ovarian cancer, expressions of EMT-related
genes were analyzed in A2780 cells and SKOV3
cells with knockdown or overexpression of FOXP1.
Knockdown of FOXP1 expression significantly
decreased expression of E-CADHERIN, VIMENTIN,
N-CADHERIN, SNAIL-1, SNAIL-2, TWIST-1, and

TWIST-2, whereas overexpression of FOXP1 significantly
increased expression of E-CADHERIN, VIMENTIN,
N-CADHERIN, SNAIL-1, SNAIL-2, TWIST-1, and
TWIST-2 in comparison with control cells (Figure 3B
and Supplementary Figure 2B). These results suggest that
FOXP1 stimulates expression of EMT-related genes in
ovarian cancer cells. Taken together, the results suggest
that FOXP1 expression is positively correlated with
expression of genes related to CSC-like characteristics in
in ovarian cancer cells.

ovarian cancer cells with or without FOXP1 knockdown (shFOXP1) or overexpression (FOXP1) was performed using probes for stemnessrelated genes A. or EMT-related genes B.

characteristics, the reporter assay was performed with
promoters of ABCG2, OCT4, NANOG, or SOX2 after cotransfection of reporter constructs with FOXP1 in A2780
ovarian cancer cells. As shown in Figure 6, overexpression
of FOXP1 significantly increased transcription activity of
ABCG2, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2. When FOXP1binding site was searched in each reporter constructs,
promoters of ABCG2, OCT4, and SOX2 showed putative
FOXP1-binding sites whereas NONOG promoter did not
(Supplementary Figure 5). Deletion of putative FOXP1bindings sites in ABCG2, OCT4, or SOX2 significantly
decreased FOXP1-mediated up-regulation of transcription
activity. These results suggest that FOXP1 may upregulate expression of ABCG2, OCT4, and SOX2 directly
and NANOG indirectly in ovarian cancer cells.

To determine whether FOXP1 is involved in the
progression of aggressiveness in ovarian cancer, we
tested the effect of FOXP1 expression on proliferation
and migration of ovarian cancer cells. To evaluate the
effect of FOXP1 expression on cell proliferation, A2780
cells or SKOV3 cells with FOXP1 knockdown or FOXP1
overexpression were cultured in comparison with control
cells, and cell numbers were monitored for 4 days.
As shown in Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure 4A,
A2780 and SKOV3 cells infected with lentiviruses against
FOXP1 showed a significant decrease of proliferation,
whereas FOXP1-overexpressing cells showed an increase
in proliferation in comparison with control cells. When
cell migration was measured by scratch wound healing
assay and transwell migration assay, FOXP1 knockdown
significantly decreased cell migration whereas FOXP1
overexpression increased cell migration in A2780 cells and
SKOV3 cells (Figure 4B–4E and Supplementary Figure
4B-4E). These results suggest that FOXP1 expression
stimulates cell proliferation and migration in ovarian
cancer cells.

FOXP1 knockdown inhibits the growth of A2780
ovarian cancer cells in xenotransplantation
To examine the role of FOXP1 in the growth of
ovarian cancer in vivo, the effect of FOXP1 knockdown
on growth of A2780 cells after injection into nude mice
was investigated. The same number of A2780 cells with or
without FOXP1 knockdown were injected into each side
of nude mice, and tumor growth in mice was observed
for 35 days. Measureable tumors were detected on day 14
after injection, and tumors were removed on day 35. As
shown in Figure 7A and 7B, the injection of control A2780
cells resulted in generation of noticeable sized tumors at
the site of injection, whereas the injection of A2780 cells
with FOXP1 knockdown generated much smaller tumors.
The time course follow-up of tumor volume showed that
tumors from A2780 cells with FOXP1 knockdown were
consistently smaller than tumors from control A2780
cells during development (Figure 7C). When tumors
were weighed on day 35 after sacrificing mice, tumors
from A2780 cells with FOXP1 knockdown weighed
significantly less than tumors from control A2780 cells.
These results suggest that FOXP1 expression is required
for in vivo growth of ovarian cancer.
Taken together, we showed correlation of FOXP1
expression with the promotion of CSC characteristics, such
as the enhancement of spheroid formation, proliferation,
and migration, in ovarian cancer cells. FOXP1 expression
promoted the expression of genes related to development
of CSC characteristics including stemness-related genes,
EMT-related genes, and drug resistance-related genes. In
addition, FOXP1 knockdown significantly inhibited in
vivo growth of ovarian cancer cells. These results strongly
suggest that FOXP1 functions as an oncogene in ovarian
cancer and can be a valuable target in development of
relapse-free treatment for ovarian cancer patients.

FOXP1 promotes resistance to chemotherapy in
ovarian cancer cells
To determine whether FOXP1 expression is involved
in regulation of chemoresistance, a key characteristic of
CSC, in ovarian cancer, the viability of A2780 or SKOV3
ovarian cancer cells was evaluated with FOXP1 knockdown
or overexpression in the presence of chemotherapy reagents
Paclitaxel or Cisplatin. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B,
the viability of A2780 cells or SKOV3 cells showed
a gradual decrease with increasing concentrations of
Paclitaxel or Cisplatin. Knockdown of FOXP1 expression
in A2780 cells or SKOV3 cells further decreased the
viability after Paclitaxel or Cisplatin treatment, indicating
a significant increase in the drug sensitivity. On the contrary,
overexpression of FOXP1 in A2780 cells or SKOV3
cells increased the resistance to Paclitaxel or Cisplatin
treatment. Gene expression analysis by RT-PCR showed
that knockdown of FOXP1 in A2780 cells or SKOV3 cells
resulted in decreased expression of ABCB1, ABCG2, or
ABCC6, whereas overexpression of FOXP1 in A2780 cells
or SKOV3 cells led to increased expression of ABCB1,
ABCG2, or ABCC6 (Figure 5C and 5D). These results
suggest that FOXP1 expression positively correlates
with expression of drug transporters and resistance to
chemotherapeutic reagents in ovarian cancer cells.

on the cellular context. High expression of FOXP1 was
reported in a variety of B-cell lymphomas, in which
FOXP1 plays an oncogenic role [19]. In contrast, FOXP1
was reported to act as a potential tumor suppressor in
prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, or breast cancer.
[20]. However, the function of FOXP1 in ovarian cancer
has not been clear. Previous studies of FOXP1 in ovarian
cancer have reported correlation of expression with the
degree or malignancies of ovarian cancer along with
contradictory observations [15, 21–25]. Recently, in
analysis of tissue samples from ovarian cancer patients,
Lin’s group reported negative correlation of nuclear
expression of FOXP1 with increasing tumor grade and
poor prognosis, suggesting that FOXP1 may function as a
tumor suppressor [23–25]. However, Giatromanolaki et al.
found no correlation between FOXP1 and overall survival
in low-risk, early-stage endometrial cancers [15]. On the
contrary, the prognosis of patients with chemoresistance
was very poor when FOXP1 was up-regulated in stage III

serous ovarian carcinoma, suggesting that FOXP1 may
function as an oncogene [22].
In the current study, we demonstrated that
FOXP1 functions as an oncogene in epithelial ovarian
cancer cells by promoting the CSC-like characteristics
including spheroid formation, cell proliferation, cell
migration, drug resistance, and tumorigenic potential. In
estrogen receptor α-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells,
overexpression of FOXP1 by exogenous transfection
increased cell proliferation whereas knockdown of FOXP1
expression by siRNA decreased proliferation of MCF-7
cells [26]. In glioblastoma with epidermal growth factor
receptor amplification, silencing FOXP1 expression
inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent
tumorigenicity [27]. In bone marrow-derived Ba/F3 cells,
FOXP1 was suggested as a therapy resistance marker as
FOXP1 protected cells against apoptotic cell death and
knockdown of FOXP1 decreased expression of genes
involved in cell migration [28]. These results suggest

that FOXP1 functions as an oncogene depending on the
cellular context.
Accumulating evidence suggests that epithelial
ovarian cancer is a CSC-driven disease [29, 30]. In
the current study, we showed FOXP1 up-regulated
transcription activity of ABCG2, OCT4, NANOG, and
SOX2 in A2780 ovarian cancer cells. The first report of
CSCs in epithelial ovarian cancer showed expression
of OCT4 and NANOG in self-renewing spheroids [6].
In embryonic stem cells, an evolutionarily conserved
alternative splicing variant of FOXP1 was shown to
induce the expression of pluripotency genes, including
OCT4 and NANOG, and promote the maintenance of
pluripotency [10]. However, embryonic stem cell-specific

splicing variant of FOXP1 was not detected in A2780
ovarian cancer cells (data not shown). A recent report
showed that SOX2 expression was associated with stem
cell state in human ovarian carcinoma [31]. Expression of
ABCG2, a drug resistance gene, in ALDH-positive cells
has been observed in normal stem cells, cancer stem cells,
and drug resistant cancers [32]. Though broader spectrum
of CSCs may need to be tested to evaluate how common
FOXP1 to core CSC transcription network, FOXP1 upregulates expression of CSC-related core transcription
factors, including ABCG2, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2,
in ovarian cancer cells.
Taken together, the current study demonstrated
that FOXP1 functions as an oncogene by promoting

viable cells under a microscope after trypan blue staining.

Chemotherapy resistance assay
To assess chemosensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to
Paclitaxel and Cisplatin, cells were seeded at 4×103 cells
per well (96-well plates, Corning) in 100 μL RPMI1640
medium supplemented with 2% FBS. Cells were treated
with 0 to 5 μM Paclitaxel and Cisplatin for 24 h (n = 3
per drug dose). Relative cell numbers were determined
by MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2, 5-diphenyl

expressed relative to vehicle (DMSO)-treated control.
After 24 h of drug treatment, cells were stained with 100
μL sterile MTT dye (0.5 mg/mL, Sigma) for 2 h at 37°C,
followed by removal of the culture medium and addition
of 100 μL DMSO. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm,
with 655 nm as the reference wavelength using a microplate spectrophotometer (Tecan, Morrisville, NC). The
relative percentage of cell viability was calculated by
dividing the absorbance of treated cells by that of the
control in each experiment.

RNA extraction and RT- PCR
Total RNA was extracted from 80–90% confluent
cultures using TRIzol reagent (Sigma) and reverse
transcribed into cDNA using the Reverse Transcription
cDNA Kit (#RT50KN; NanoHelix Co., Ltd). cDNA in 1
μL of the reaction mixture was amplified using the Ready2×-Go pre-mix PCR kit (#PMD008L; NanoHelix) and 10
pmol each of sense and antisense primers. The thermal
cycle profile was as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 30 s,
annealing at 54°C for 30 s depending on the primers used,
and extension at 72°C for 30 s. Each PCR reaction was
carried out for 25-30 cycles. Primer sequences are shown
in Supplementary Table 1. PCR products were analyzed by
1% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Lentiviral and retroviral infection
Lentiviral shRNA construct targeting FOXP1
was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Louis, MO). For
generation of lentiviral particles, 293FT cells were
transfected with the 6.67 μg targeted viral plasmid and
lentiviral packaging mix; 5 μg of VSV-G and 3.33 μg
of Δ8.9 using 15 μL Lipofectamine/Lipofectamine Plus
reagent. For retroviral overexpression of FOXP1, FOXP1
cDNA was subcloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of
the pMXs IRES GFP retroviral vector (#RTV-013; Cell
Biolabs, Inc.) and then transfected with the 5 μg targeted
viral plasmid, 5 μg of VSV and 5 μg of gag/pol into
293FT cells by using Lipofectamine/Lipofectamine Plus
reagent. The culture supernatants containing lentivirus
or retrovirus were harvested and concentrated using
the Lenti-X Concentrator (#631231; Clontech) and
Retro-X Concentrator (#631445; Clontech) at 48 h after
transfection. For lentiviral or retroviral transduction,
A2780 cells were infected with shRNA-bearing lentivirus
or pMXs-RNA-bearing retrovirus in the presence of 5
μg/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). FOXP1-silenced
or –overexpressed cells were selected for 10 days with
1μg/mL puromycin and then maintained in RPMI1640
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 μg/mL puromycin.

Computational searches for FOXP1 sequences
The FOXP1 binding motif was searched in binding
sites using the MatInspector application [33], a part of
GenomatixSuite software (Genomatix Software GmbH,
Germany). The matrices FOXP1_ES.01 (Genomatix
Matrix Library 8.2) were used with a core similarity
threshold of 0.75 and a matrix similarity threshold of
Optimal -0.02. Sequences bearing a match of any of
the four matrices were termed FOXP1 sequences. The
remaining sequences were classified as FOXP1 and
scanned for other TF binding sites motifs contained in the
Genomatix Matrix Library using the standard parameters,
as described previously [34].

ABCG2, OCT4, SOX2 promoter and deletion of
FOXP1 binding element promoter constructs
The human OCT4 and SOX2 promoter containing
the FOXP1 binding elements luciferase report plasmids
were cloned by PCR of human genomic DNA (forward:
5′-G CTCAGTCTTTGAGGGGATTGC-3′; reverse:
5′-CGAGAAGGCAAAATCTGAAGC-3′ for OCT4;
forward:
5′-GGAAGGAAACTTAGACGAGGC-3′;
reverse: 5′- CTTCTCTCCCTTTCTTTCTC-3′ for
SOX2) and excising the promoter fragment from the
above mentioned products and subcloned into the
Kpn1 (NEB #R3142) and HindIII (NEB #R3104)
site of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). ABCG2
promoter construct was a kind donation from Dr Ross
[35]. NANOG-Core promoter was purchased from
addgene (pNANOG-Luc; Plasmid #25900). Deletion

Cell proliferation assay
A2780 cells and SKOV3 cells were seeded in
12-well culture plates at a density of 1×104 cells/well,
cultured for 4 days in normal growth medium (RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100
U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). Cells were
harvested using trypsin/EDTA solution and washed twice

sequences in reporter constructs are as follows; human
ABCG2
promoter
(TTGATTTGTTTTTACTT,
TGGAAATGTTTTCATTT); human OCT4 promoter
(ATCTAAAAACAAGAGGG); human SOX2 promoter
(TAGCGACAACAAGAGAA).
Deletion
mutant
constructs were generated using the QuikChange II XL
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies)
according to the manufacture’s instruction. The intended
mutations were confirmed by sequencing.

RPMI medium with 10% FBS at a concentration of 1×105
cells/mL. Membrane filters (8-μm pore size) in disposable
96-well chemotaxis chambers (Neuro Probe, Gaithersburg,
MD) were pre-coated for 6 h with 20 μg/mL rat-tail
collagen at room temperature. Aliquots (50 μL per well) of
the cell suspension were loaded into the upper chambers,
and RPMI medium with 10% FBS or experimental
medium was placed in the lower chamber. After incubation
for 12 h at 37°C, the filters were disassembled, and the
upper surface of each filter was scraped free of cells by
wiping it with a cotton swab. The numbers of cells that
had migrated to the lower surfaces of each filter were
determined by counting the cells in three different places
under the microscope (×100 magnification) after staining
with Hoechst 33342 (10 μM).

Transactivation activity assay
A2780 (human ovarian cancer cells, ATCC,
Rockville, MD, USA) cells were plated in 12-well
culture plates at 3×105 cells per well. Transfection
experiments were performed 16 hours after cell seeding
using Lipofectamine/Lipofectamine plus according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the transfection
mixtures contained 400 ng of reporter construct (ABCG2
reporter constructs, pGL3-basic containing ABCG2
promoter WT and deletion of FOXP1 binding element
ABCG2 promoter; OCT4 promoter; deletion of FOXP1
binding element OCT4 promoter; NANOG; SOX2
promoter; deletion of FOXP1 binding element SOX2
promoter) and 400 ng of pCMV-Tag2B FOXP1 expression
plasmid, and 10 ng of internal control plasmid (pCMV-RL
vector containing Renilla luciferase, Promega). ABCG2
reporter construct was produced as described previously
[35]. Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested,
lysed, and centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 3 min at 4°C, and
the luciferase activity was determined according to the
manufacturer's instructions. All experimental values were
averaged from triplicate determinations per experimental
condition, and the experiments were performed in
triplicate. Subsequently, luciferase activity was measured
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega) using VICTOR3 (Perkin Elmer).

Immunofluorescence Staining
For immunofluorescence staining, cells were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed twice
with PBS, and blocked with 1% FBS in PBS for 30 min;
all procedures were performed at room temperature. The
fixed specimens were incubated with primary antibodies
for 1 h, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies
for 1 h. Primary antibodies (1:100) were detected by Alexa
Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated secondary
antibodies (1:1000) (Invitrogen, CA). The specimens
were finally washed and mounted in Vectashield
medium (Vector Laboratories, CA) with 4',6-diamidino2-phenylindole for visualization of nuclei. The stained
sections were visualized using laser scanning confocal
microscopy (Olympus FluoView FV1000).

Flow cytometry
ALDH activity was determined using the Aldefluor
assay kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC,
Canada) as described by the manufacturer. Analysis of
fluorescence intensity of the stained cells was performed
using a FACSAria-III cell sorter (BD Biosciences, CA).
ALDH activity of the sample was determined based on
the fluorescence intensity beyond the threshold defined by
the reaction with diethylaminobenzaldehyde. To prevent
cross-contamination between ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cells,
sorting gates of these two populations were set up at least
one log apart.

Scratch wound healing assay
Ovarian cancer cells were seeded into 6-well
plates and grown to confluence. A scratch wound was
introduced on the cell monolayer using a 200 μL pipette
tip. The cells were immediately rinsed with HBSS to
remove the cell debris and then grown in normal growth
media. Images using phase-contrast microscopy were
acquired immediately after the scratch at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h,
and 72 h for A2780 cells and at 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and
24 h for SKOV3 cells after introducing scratch wound.
For quantification, the wound gap was measured using
ImageJ software (ver 1.37), and the average wound gaps
are shown after normalization to 0h.

In vivo xenograft transplantation
Animal experiments were performed using a
protocol approved by the Pusan National University
Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. BALB/cnude mice (male, age 8-10 weeks, weight 22-24g) were
randomly divided into two groups (six mice in each
group). Mice in the control groups received subcutaneous
injection with control-shRNA-infected A2780 cells (1×103
cells per 200 mL PBS) and experimental groups received

subcutaneous injection of FOXP1-shRNA-infected
A2780 cells (1×103 cells per 200 mL PBS). Cells were
injected subcutaneously into the right and left side of the
flank region of 8-week-old male BALB/c-nude mice. On
indicated dates after injection of cells, tumors volumes
were determined using an external caliper. The following
formula was used for calculation of tumor volume: tumor
volume (mm3) = tumor length (mm) × tumor width (mm) ×
tumor width (mm)/2. All mice were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation on day 35 after injection. Subcutaneous tumors
were surgically excised, weighed, and photographed.
