ABSTRACT
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly cancers because
of a lack of early diagnotic markers and efficient therapeutics. The fluorinated analog
of deoxycytidine, gemcitabine and emerging FOLFIRINOX protocol (5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), irinotecan/SN-38, oxaliplatin and leucovorin) are the main chemotherapies
to treat PDAC. The ErbB2/HER2 oncogenic receptor is commonly overexpressed in
PDAC. In this context, we aimed to decipher the ErbB2-mediated mechanisms of
chemoresistance to the two main chemotherapy protocols used to treat PDAC.
ErbB2 knocking down (KD) in CAPAN-1 and CAPAN-2 cells led to an increased
sensitivity to gemcitabine and an increased resistance to irinotecan/SN-38 both
in vitro and in vivo (subcuteanous xenografts) This was correlated to an increase of
hCNT1 and hCNT3 transporters and ABCG2, MRP1 and MRP2 ATP-binding cassette
transporters expression and resistance to cell death. We also show that MRP2 is
repressed following activation of JNK, Erk1/2 and NF-κB pathways by ErbB2. Finally,
in datasets of human PDAC samples, ErbB2 and MRP2 expression was conversely
correlated. Altogether, we propose that ErbB2 mediates several intracellular
mechanisms linked to PDAC cell chemoresistance that may represent potential targets
in order to ameliorate chemotherapy response and allow stratification of patients
eligible for either gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX treatment.

main chemotherapeutic drug used in firstline in advanced
pancreatic cancer (PC). Despite the improvement of
patient’s quality of life, the gain in survival remains
short (6 additional months). This is mainly due to the
high resistance of PC cells to the drug [4]. In 2011, the
FOLFIRINOX regimen (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin,
irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) emerged as a new option in
patients with metastatic PC and a good performance
status [5]. FOLFIRINOX was associated with a survival
advantage but had increased toxicity. SN-38 which is the
active metabolite of irinotecan binds to the topoisomerase
I thereby (i) inducing DNA cleavage during S phase of cell
cycle and (ii) driving apoptosis [6]. Among SN-38-

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of
the most deadly cancers in western countries with an
extremely poor prognosis (survival rate of 6 months)
[1, 2]. Pancreatic cancers are projected to become the
second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030 [3].
This dramatic outcome is related to a lack of efficient
therapeutic tools and early diagnostic markers. At the time
of diagnosis, more than 80% of patients have metastasis
or locally advanced cancer. Only about 10 to 15% of
patients are considered eligible for surgical resection.

mediated chemoresistance mechanisms is the inactivation
of SN-38 by UDP-glucuronosyl transferase in the
liver [7]. Another mechanism related to chemoresistance
is the increase of multidrug resistance protein MDR1
(P-glycoprotein/ABCB1), MDR-related proteins MRP1/2
(ABCC1/2), or ABCG2 (BCRP) ATP-binding cassette
transporter expression [7]. These transporters play
important roles in normal physiology by exporting toxic
xenobiotics as well as many drugs used in clinics and
thereby reducing their efficiency [8].
Deciphering the mechanisms responsible for PDAC
cell resistance to chemotherapy is thus mandatory if one
wants to improve efficacy of the drugs and propose more
efficient therapies.
The ErbB2/HER2 type I transmembrane growth
factor receptor belongs to the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) family also comprising ErbB3
and ErbB4. The ErbB2 protein consists in an extracellular
domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular
tyrosine kinase domain. ErbB2 has no known ligand
and is described as a coreceptor which hetero-dimerizes
with the other ErbB receptors [9]. ErbB2 is commonly
overexpressed and frequently amplified in cancers,
including PDAC [10]. Notably, ErbB2 overexpression
was shown to be an independent factor for a worse
prognosis in PDAC [11]. The MUC4 membrane-bound
mucin, that is a membrane partner of ErbB2 [12], was
recently shown to regulate the hCNT1 transporter
expression via the NF-κB pathway leading to decreased
PC cell sensitivity to gemcitabine [13]. Previous studies
suggested the relationship of the ErbB2 receptor and
chemotherapeutic sensitivity to lapatinib eventually
combined with SN-38 in other epithelial cancers [14, 15].
However, the involvement of ErbB2 in chemo-resistance
in PDAC remains to be elucidated.
In this work, we demonstrate for the first time
that ErbB2 silencing leads to an increased sensitivity
of PC cells to gemcitabine via hCNT1/3 transporters.
Moreover, ErbB2 silencing induces PC cell resistance to
SN-38 treatment via an upregulation of MRP2 multidrug
resistance protein. Finally, we show that ErbB2 and
MRP2 expression is conversely correlated in human
PDAC samples.

marker BclXL, leading to a decrease of the Bax/BclXL
ratio, suggesting a lower susceptibility to apoptosis.
Additionally, the activation of the cell cycle and apoptosis
mediator p53 (phosphorylated p53/constitutive p53 ratio)
was decreased in ErbB2-KD cells (Figure 1B).
Measurement of ErbB2-KD sensitivity to
gemcitabine was studied in CAPAN-2 cells. IC50 showed
that the loss of ErbB2 leads to an increased sensitivity of
CAPAN-2 cells to gemcitabine (ErbB2-KD = 11 ± 0.8 nM
vs NT = 23.8 ± 1.9 nM) (Figure 1C).
The sensitivity to the drugs of the FOLFIRINOX
protocol showed no difference for 5-FU (ErbB2-KD  =
2.82 ± 0.6 μM vs NT = 2.96 ± 0.6 μM) or oxaliplatin
(ErbB2-KD = 2.14 ± 0.3 μM vs NT = 2.4 ± 0.3 μM) and
a mild increase of sensitivity to SN-38, the irinotecan
active metabolite, (NT 1.08 ± 0.09 nM vs ErbB2-KD
1.46 ± 0.05 nM). Using different combinations of 5-FU,
oxaliplatin and SN-38, we show that the lack of ErbB2
potentiates survival to SN-38 alone (6-fold, p < 0.001)
or combined with 5-FU (FIRI), oxaliplatin (IRINOX)
or both molecules (FIRINOX) (Figure 1D). H2A.X
phosphorylated at Ser139 is required for DNA repair
following double-stranded DNA breaks [16]. SN-38
treatment induced an increase of phospho-Ser139 H2A.X
foci in the nuclei of both NT and ErbB2-KD cells and an
increase of positive cells (Figure 1E and supplemental
Figure S1). This increase was higher in NT cells compared
to ErbB2-KD cells following SN-38 treatment suggesting
less DNA damage in ErbB2-KD cells. We also observed
a mild increase of phospho-Ser139 H2A.X in ErbB2-KD
cells following gemcitabine treatment.
By transient inhibition of ErbB2 using a siRNA
approach, we observed a decrease of cell survival
following gemcitabine treatment of PC cells compared to
control (Figure 1F). Moreover, we showed a significant
increase of survival rate of both CAPAN-1 and
CAPAN-2 cells following SN-38 treatment (Figure 1G).
We also confirmed the ErbB2-mediated alteration of
chemosensitivity in Panc1 and BxPC-3 cells (supplemental
Figure S2). Altogether these results indicate that ErbB2
may be involved in mediating PDAC cell sensitivity to
gemcitabine and SN-38.

CAPAN-2 cells (Figure 2C and 2D) and to an increase of
hCNT1 mRNA and protein only in CAPAN-2 cells (Figure
2D). CAPAN-1 cells expressed a high basal protein level
of hCNT1. Altogether, this suggests that ErbB2 inhibition
promotes gemcitabine sensitivity via hCNT1/3 transporters.

in both CAPAN-1 and CAPAN-2 cells (supplemental
Figure S3). Finally, implication of MRP1, MRP2 and
ABCG2 in SN-38 cell sensitivity was investigated using
specific siRNAs (Figure 3C). Knocking down of MRP1 or
MRP2 combined with ABCG2 reduced the survival rate
of ErbB2-KD CAPAN-2 cells that harbour an increased
expression of these channels (Figure 3C) as well as in
CAPAN-1 and CAPAN-2 cells (not shown). Interestingly,
MRP1 and MRP2 combined inhibition led to a synergistic
reduction of cell viability (##p < 0.01) whereas subsequent
inhibition of ABCG2 along with MRP1 and MRP2 did not
have any additional effect. SN-38 treatment led to a 50%
reduction of cell viability in ErbB2-KD cells transfected
with control siRNA. SiRNA targeting MRP1 and MRP2

led to a significant decrease (p < 0.01) of the NT tumor

Identification of the signaling pathways
mediating SN-38 resistance

DISCUSSION
Resistance to chemotherapeutic drug treatment
is a major challenge for clinicians in pancreatic cancer
because it is responsible for the inefficiency of therapies.
The characterization of chemoresistance molecular
mechanisms and identification of new therapeutic
tools and/or prognosis biomarkers for personalized
chemotherapy shall promote more successful therapy.
Our results show for the first time that the loss of
ErbB2 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine
treatment. We also show that hCNT1 and hCNT3
expression are upregulated. Previous work showed
that ErbB2 inhibition improved the cytoxic effect of
gemcitabine in prostate cancer cells [17]. We had also
previously showed that the human mucin MUC4 forms
a complex at the membrane with the oncogenic receptor
ErbB2 [12] and that loss of MUC4 in pancreatic cancer
cells led to an increased sensitivity to gemcitabine and
an increased expression of hCNT1 correlated to cell
survival [13]. Altogether, this supports the hypothesis of
ErbB2 and MUC4 acting as a complex to maintain a drug
resistant phenotype.
The loss of ErbB2 in CAPAN-2 pancreatic cancer
cells induces an increase of SN-38 chemoresistance. In
gastric cells, combination of trastuzumab (monoclonal
antibody targeting ErbB2) and SN-38 effects differ
depending on the order of trastuzumab and SN-38
administration. Sequential addition of SN-38 and
trastuzumab increases the effectiveness of treatment
while the reverse (trastuzumab and SN-38) reduces the
efficiency of SN-38 [18]. In the present work, treatment
with SN-38 follows the ErbB2 inhibition mimicking
the sequence trastuzumab/SN-38 leading to increased
resistance.
SN-38 is a topoisomerase I inhibitor displaying
antiproliferative effect by stabilizing topoI-DNA
complexes [19]. The action of SN-38 is optimal during
the replicative phase of the cell cycle (S-phase). The
loss of ErbB2 triggers a decrease of cell proliferation
characterized by a decrease of the S phase and G2/M and
an increase in the G1 phase [12] and could therefore reduce
the efficiency window of SN-38 cytotoxicity. Recently,
p53 mutant has been associated with gemcitabine
chemoresistance in PDAC [20] highlighting the relevance
of the p53 status on the PDAC cell response. Indeed, we
observed a decreased phosphorylation of p53 in ErbB2KD cells that are more sensitive to gemcitabine. Moreover,
p53 status is closely connected to an autophagy role in
pancreatic tumor development [21–23]. ErbB2 expression

We focused our studies on MRP2 transporter, for
which we confirmed its overexpression in ErbB2-KD
xenografts. In order to identify the molecular mechanisms
that control MRP2 expression, we investigated alterations
of the main signaling pathways in CAPAN-2 ErbB2-KD
cells compared to NT control cells. The results indicate
that the loss of ErbB2 led to a decrease of both Erk1/2,
JNK, p38 MAPK and Akt activation, and a decrease of
NF-κB p65 expression (Figure 5A).
Implication of Erk1/2, JNK and p38 kinases, and
NF-κB and Akt pathways in SN-38 resistance was then
investigated using specific siRNAs in CAPAN-2 and
CAPAN-1 cells. Our results indicate that JNK targeting
led to an increase of CAPAN-2 survival rate when treated
with SN-38 compared to control siRNA (**p < 0.001)
(Figure 5B). Erk1 targeting led to an increase of CAPAN-1
survival rate under the same conditions (**p < 0.001)
suggesting cell specificity of signaling pathways regulating
cell cytotoxicity (Figure 5B). SiRNA targeting NF-κB,
Akt or p38 did not alter SN-38 resistance (not shown).
Altogether, our results indicate that Erk and JNK regulate
SN-38 cytotoxicity in CAPAN-1 and CAPAN-2 cells.
Our results indicate that transient inhibition of
ErbB2, Erk1/2 and JNK using siRNA led to a significant
increase of MRP2 mRNA expression in CAPAN-2 cells
(4-, 2.1- and 2.3-fold, p < 0.01, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05,
respectively). The same effect was observed in CAPAN-1
except for JNK (Figure 5C). Altogether, our results
indicate that Erk, JNK and NF-κB negatively regulate
MRP2 expression in PC cells.

ErbB2, hCNT1, hCNT3, ABCG2, MRP1 and
MRP2 in PDAC datasets
Using PDAC datasets of the NCBI Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO, GSE28735) database, ErbB2, hCNT1,
hCNT3, ABCG2, MRP1 and MRP2 mRNA expression
was measured in 45 tumors (T) and adjacent non tumor
tissues (ANT). We observed that ErbB2, MRP1 and
MRP2 expression significantly differed (***p < 0.001)
with ErbB2 and MRP1 increased in tumor tissues

We confirmed these alterations in GSE16515 dataset

suppresses autophagy in mammary tumorigenesis [24]
suggesting a similar complex interplay involving ErbB2,
p53 and autophagy in pancreatic cancer.
In this report, we show that NF-κB, Erk and JNK
pathways are altered following the loss of ErbB2 in
PC cells and are involved in the complex regulation of
MRP2 channel. We previously showed a link between
these pathways using pharmacological inhibition of the
MAPK and JNK pathways that led to a strong decrease
of NF-κB expression [13]. JNK and ERK are implicated
in the SN-38 resistance in a cell specific manner. Notably,
CAPAN-2 cells, which express ErbB2, harbor an active
JNK signaling pathway. JNK signaling pathway role in
cell survival remains controversial as JNK orchestrates
or antagonizes cell proliferation/survival balance in a
stimuli- and tissue-specific manner [25]. JNK activation
was shown to be needed in the cytotoxic effect of SN-38
in myeloma [26] or glioblastoma [27].
We also observed that Erk promotes PC cell survival
in response to SN-38 treatment. On the contrary, in colon
cancer cells, treatment with an Erk inhibitor enhanced
SN-38 antitumor efficacy [28] indicating the cell-specific
role of Erk signaling pathway in chemotherapy response.
Indeed, in our work, we observe the involvement of either
JNK or Erk signaling pathways that is PC cell-dependent.
We also previously showed that NF-κB regulates
the hCNT1 transporter and mediates gemcitabine
resistance [13]. NF-κB also transcriptionally represses the
expression of MRP2 but is not involved in the cytotoxicity
to SN-38 treatment in PC cells.
Altogether, these data suggest that JNK, Erk and
NF-κB may not be attractive targets for overcoming drug
resistance because of the complex interplay between them
and their cell-specificity in cytotoxicity. However, c-fos
(activated by Erk) and c-Jun (activated by JNK) form the
downstream AP-1 complex activating the target genes.
We propose that targeting either the upstream ErbB2
receptor or the downstream AP-1 transcription factor,
should overcome these limitations.

The human genome contains 48 genes that encode
ABC transporters. The overexpression of these drug efflux
transporters confers a high degree of resistance to various
anticancer drugs [29]. We observed that mRNA levels
of MRP1 and MRP2 are altered in tumors compared to
adjacent non tumoral tissue.
CAPAN-2 ErbB2-KD cells strongly overexpressed
mRNA of ABCG2, MRP1 and MRP2 transporters. ABCG2
has been described as directly involved in acquired
resistance to SN-38 in colon cancer cells [30, 31].
Mohelnikova-Duchonova et al described the upregulation
of ABCG2 mRNA in PDAC and proposed that ABCG2
in tumors may contribute to the generally poor treatment
response [32]. However, we never observed the protein
expression of ABCG2 in PC cells. MRP1 and MRP2 are
two other important multidrug resistance transporters
as their substrates include many commonly used
chemotherapeutic drugs including SN-38 [8]. MRP2
correlates with unfavorable prognosis in a variety of
tumors such as gallbladder carcinoma or breast cancer
[33, 34]. MRP1 and MRP2 were previously shown to
be expressed in 83 and 91% of a PDAC cohort [35].
We propose that MRP1 and MRP2 contribute to PDAC
resistance to SN-38 treatment. The aberrant expression
of these two channels in PDAC might be considered as
a bad prognosis marker since they promote the irinotecan
therapeutic failure.
In this work, we used subcutaneous xenografts
which are a convenient model to study molecular
mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy in vivo.
However, this model does not recapitulate the whole
histopathological features of PDAC and notably the
tumour microenvironment involvement. Further studies
using pancreatic allografts in immune-deficient mice,
orthotopic xenografts and syngenic models will be useful
to address this question.
The National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Working
Group and the Biomarkers Consortium defined a
biomarker as “a characteristic that is objectively measured

as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic
processes, or a pharmacological response to a therapeutic
intervention (http://www.biomarkersconsortium.org)”
[36]. However, despite the discovery of thousands of
cancer markers over the past decades, no new major
cancer biomarkers have been approved for clinical use for
at least 25 years [37] supporting that it would be more
clinically relevant to optimize the use of existing markers
such as ErbB2, rather than describing new ones. Our
in vitro results show that ErbB2 expression in PC cells
is associated with gemcitabine resistance and SN-38
increased sensitivity (Figure 7). We propose that ErbB2
could be a potential marker of chemotherapy response
to stratify patients eligible for either gemcitabine or
FOLFIRINOX treatment. Additional preclinical studies
are requested to validate this hypothesis.

conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) were
used and immunoreactive bands were visualised using the
West Pico chemoluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific,
Pierce, Brebières, France). Chemo-luminescence was
visualised using LAS4000 apparatus (Fujifilm). Densities
of bands were integrated using Image Quant TL 8.1 (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences, Velizy-Villacoublay, France)
and represented as histograms. Three independent
experiments were performed.

Cytotoxicity assay
Cells were seeded in growth medium into
96-well plates at a density of 104 cells per well.
After  24 h  incubation, the medium was replaced
by fresh  medium containing gemcitabine, 5-FU,
oxaliplatin or SN-38 at the determined concentration
(range: 10 nM–20 μM) and incubated for 72 h at 37°C.
The viability of cells was determined using the 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described [13].
For drug combinations, concentrations corresponding to
40% cell survival were used as follows: 5-FU at 1 μM,
oxaliplatin at 1 μM and SN-38 at 20 nM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
CAPAN-1, CAPAN-2, BxPC-3 and Panc1 PC cell
lines were cultured as previously described [38, 39].
ErbB2-knocked down (KD) cells were obtained
following stable transfection of CAPAN-2 cells with
pGeneClipTM puromycin vector encoding ErbB2 ShRNA
(SA BiosciencesTM) as previously described [12].
The empty vector was used to raise control clones called
Non Targeting (NT). Four selected clones of NT and
ErbB2-KD cells were pooled in order to avoid clonal
variation. All cell lines were periodically authenticated by
morphologic inspection, expression profile of ErbB2 by
western blotting and tested negative every 6 months for
mycoplasma contamination using Mycoalert kit (Lonza).
All cells were maintained in a 37°C incubator with 5%
CO2 and cultured as the parental cells.

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction qRT-PCR
Total RNA from PC cells was prepared using
the NucleoSpin® RNA II kit (Macherey Nagel,
Hoerdt, Germany). cDNA was prepared as previously
described [42]. PCR was performed using SsoFastTM
Evagreen Supermix kit following the manufacturer’s
protocol using the CFX96 real time PCR system (BioRad). Primer information is given in Table 1. Each marker
was assayed in triplicate in three independent experiments.
Expression level of genes of interest was normalized to the
mRNA level of GAPDH housekeeping gene.

Western-blotting
Total cellular extracts and western blotting were
performed as previously described [40, 41] using
antibodies against phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204)
(clone 20G11, 1/500), Erk1/2 (clone I37F5, 1/500),
NF-κB Phospho-p65 (Ser536) (clone 93H1, 1/500),

or hCNT3 (HPA023311; 1/500), β-actin (A5441, 1/5000)
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Quentin Fallavier, France).
Antibodies were diluted in 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk
in Tris-Buffered Saline Tween-20 (TBS-T). Peroxydasewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RNA interference
Transient inhibitions of ABCG2 (sc-41151), MRP1
(sc-35962) MRP2 (sc-35963), Akt (sc-43609) and p38
(sc-29433) were performed using a pool of siRNA
designed  by Santa Cruz Biotechnology following cell
transfection with Effectene® (Qiagen) as described by the
manufacturer. Transient KD for ErbB2, Erk1 (MAPK3),
JNK1 (MAPK8), NF-κB (p105 NF-κB) was performed using
siRNA from Dharmacon (Thermo Scientific) following the
protocol described previously [41]. Controls were performed
using a Non-Targeting siRNA (NT) in both protocols. Cells
were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well into 6-well
plates for RNA and protein extraction, or at a density of 104
cells per well into 96-well plates for cytotoxic assay, and left
for 48 h at 37°C before gemcitabine treatment (100 nM) or
SN-38 (20 nM) for another 24 h at 37°C.

France). Once palpable tumors were developed
(250 mm3), gemcitabine (15 mg/kg), SN-38 (40 mg/kg)
or PBS (200 μl) were injected intra-peritoneously, twice
a week. Six mice were used per group. Tumor size was
evaluated by measuring the length (l) and the width (L)
twice a week and tumor volume was calculated with the
formula (l2 × L). All procedures were in accordance with
the guideline of animal care committee (Comité Ethique
Expérimentation Animale Nord Pas-de-Calais).

Immunofluorescence was performed on ErbB2KD and NT CAPAN-2 cells grown on Lab-Tek
Chamber Slides (Nunc). The cells were fixed with 4%
(v/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C, quenched
for 20 min with 50 mM NH4Cl in D-PBS+Mg2++Ca2+
(Life Technologies) and permeabilized with 0.2% (w/v)
saponin in D-PBS+Mg2++Ca2+ for 20 min. The saturation
step was performed for 20 min with D-PBS+Mg2++Ca2+
containing 3% (w/v) BSA and 0.2% saponin. Cells
were incubated overnight with an anti-phospho-Ser139
H2A.X antibody (Merck-Millipore #05-636) diluted to
1:500 in D-PBS+Mg2++Ca2+ containing 3% (w/v) BSA
and 0.2% (w/v) saponin. Alexa-633 conjugated goat
anti-mouse antibody was used as a secondary antibody.
F-actin staining was obtained by incubating cells with
Alexa-488 conjugated Phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Life
Technologies) for 20 min at room temperature. Slides
were mounted in mounting medium containing diamidino2-phenylindole and visualized with a Zeiss LSM 710
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy). Images
were captured and analysed with the Zeiss Efficient
Navigation software (ZEN, Carl Zeiss Microscopy). Three
independent experiments were performed.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Pancreatic tissues were fixed in 10% (w/v) buffered
formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut at 4 μm thickness
and applied on SuperFrost® slides (Menzel-Glaser,
Braunschweig, Germany). Manual IHC was carried out
as previously described [43]. The antibodies were used
as followed: anti-ErbB2 (1:200, DAKO), anti-hCNT1
(1:100, H-70), and anti-MRP2 (1:100, sc5770, santa
cruz). TUNEL assay was performed using ApopTag® Plus
Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Kit (Chemicon) following
manufacturer’s protocol.

Gene Expression Omnibus microarray
Public PC microarrays were analysed from the
NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://
www.ncbi.nml.nih.gov/geo/). Two sets of gene-expression
profiles from GEO containing both normal pancreas and
PC tissue were used: 45 tumors and adjacent non-tumor
tissues from PDAC cases (GSE28735) and 52 samples
(16 had both tumor and normal expression data, and
