Summary

Author Manuscript

Recent research has highlighted a strong correlation between tissue-specific cancer risk and the
lifetime number of tissue-specific stem cell divisions. Whether such correlation implies a high
unavoidable intrinsic cancer risk has become a key public health debate with dissemination of the
‘bad luck’ hypothesis. Here we provide evidence that intrinsic risk factors contribute only
modestly (<10~30%) to cancer development. First, we demonstrate that the correlation between
stem-cell division and cancer risk does not distinguish between the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic
factors. Next, we show that intrinsic risk is better estimated by the lower bound risk controlling for
total stem cell divisions. Finally, we show that the rates of endogenous mutation accumulation by
intrinsic processes are not sufficient to account for the observed cancer risks. Collectively, we
conclude that cancer risk is heavily influenced by extrinsic factors. These results carry immense
consequences for strategizing cancer prevention, research, and public health.

extensive controversy regarding the conclusion that this correlation implies a very high
unavoidable risk for many cancers that are due solely to the intrinsic baseline population size
67
of tissue-specific stem cells , . Much discussion has been made to argue against the ‘bad
5–13
luck’ hypothesis
, yet none offered specific alternatives to quantitatively evaluate the
contribution of extrinsic risk factors in cancer development. Applying several distinct
modeling approaches, we here provide strong evidence that unavoidable intrinsic risk factors
contribute only modestly (<10~30%) to the development of many common cancers.

Author Manuscript

We start by making the conservative and yet conventional assumption that errors occurring
during the division of cells, being routes of malignant transformation, can be influenced by
both intrinsic processes as well as extrinsic factors (Fig. 1). “Intrinsic processes” include
those that result in mutations due to random errors in DNA replication whereas “extrinsic
factors” are environmental factors that affect mutagenesis rates (such as UV radiation,
ionizing radiation, and carcinogens). For example, radiation can cause DNA damage, which
would primarily result in deleterious mutations with functional consequences on cancer
development only after cell division. Therefore, extrinsic factors may act through the
accumulation of genetic alterations during cell division to increase cancer risk. Accordingly,
intrinsic risk would result from those apparently uncontrollable intrinsic processes (Arrow 1,
Fig. 1) as well as from those highly modifiable and thus preventable extrinsic factors (Arrow
2, Fig. 1).

Correlation cannot differentiate risks

Author Manuscript

According to the above hypothesis, both intrinsic and extrinsic factors can impart cancer risk
through the accumulation of these errors, especially the ‘driver mutations’ (Arrow 3, Fig. 1).
As such, a correlational analysis between cancer risk and cell division, for either stem or
non-stem cells, is unable to differentiate between the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic
factors. This is best illustrated through a thought experiment where we consider a
hypothetical scenario of a sudden emergence of a very potent mutagen globally such as a
strong radiation burst from a nuclear fallout that quadruples the lifetime risks for all cancers.
In this scenario, it transpires that the proportion of cancer risk explained by intrinsic random
errors would be small (at most 1/4 even if we assume all the original risk was due to intrinsic
processes). However, if we conduct regression analyses on either the new hypothetical
cancer risks or the current cancer risks as reported, against the number of stem-cell
5
divisions , the correlations from both cases would be 0.81 (Fig. 2). This clearly argues
against the implication that ~2/3 of variation could be explained by division-related random
intrinsic errors and indicates that correlational analysis cannot distinguish between intrinsic
and extrinsic factors.

Extrinsic risks by tissue cell turnover
The above conclusion then raises the question of what proportion of total cancer risk is due
to extrinsic versus intrinsic factors. In a data-driven approach, we first re-examine the
quantitative relationship between the observed lifetime cancer risk and the divisions of the
5
normal tissue stem cells as reported , with a distinct alternative method. Our rationale is that
intrinsic risk, or indeed its upper bound, can be better estimated by the lowest boundary on

the plots of cancer risk vs. total tissue stem-cell divisions (red line in Fig. 3a). In other
words, intrinsic cancer risk should be determined by the cancer incidence for those cancers
with the least risk in the entire group controlling for total stem cell divisions (red dots in Fig.
3a). The argument here is that cancers with the same stem-cell divisions should share the
same base of intrinsic cancer risk (if the relationship is causal); if one or more cancers would
feature a much higher cancer incidence, for example, lung cancer among smokers vs. nonsmokers, then this most likely reflects additional (and probably extrinsic) risk factors
(smoking in this case). One could argue that the low-incidence tumor types may have lower
incidences because of additional genetic repair mechanisms that restrict evolving malignant
cells from accumulating sufficient numbers of genetic alterations required to become fully
tumorigenic; however, without more specific data on the operation of repair mechanisms,
these could drive the risk up or down, depending on whether they are less or more efficient
in any particular tissue. Since, according to our hypothesis, intrinsic risk from stem-cell
divisions would define the lowest bound for a given number of stem-cell divisions, we define
an “intrinsic” risk line for stem-cell divisions by regressing the smallest cancer risks on any
given number of stem-cell divisions (red line, Fig. 3a). The “intrinsic” risk lines themselves
are still likely overestimates for the intrinsic risk; however, we should suspect that any
cancer risk above that line implies additional biologic determinants, based on which we can
compute the percentage of cancer risk not explained by intrinsic “randomness”. As shown in
Fig. 3a, most cancer types have very high excess risks relative to the “intrinsic” risk line,
indicating large proportions of risks unaccounted by the intrinsic factors, typically larger
than 90%. Moreover, these estimated excess risks are very robust – with plausible
measurement errors added to the total stem-cell divisions, the resulting excess risks remain
essentially intact (Extended Data Table 1).

Although we preformed the initial analysis from a ‘stem-cell theory’ point of view, we
wanted to ensure that our results are independent to this specific theory. Furthermore, the
lack of reliable data on human tissue stem cell dynamics is a serious concern (see
Supplementary Information) rendering the analysis in Fig. 3a less determinate. Thus we
separately collected data for the total number of tissue cell divisions that is based on
homeostatic tissue cell numbers and their turn-over rates (see Supplementary Information),
and analyzed the relationship of cancer risk vs. total tissue cell divisions (Fig. 3b). This
approach allows for every dividing cell to be a potential cancer-initiating cell, which would
be an application of another cell-of-origin theory of cancer whereby tumors may originate
from a hierarchy of cells, from stem cells to committed progenitor cells to differentiated
4
cells . Mathematically, this can be considered also as an extreme form of stem cell theory
where the fraction of stem cells is 1 (this latter formulation then provides an upper bound of
the effects of the size of the stem cell population on cancer risk and the role of extrinsic
factors). The regression analysis between cancer risk and total tissue cell division shows a
high correlation of 0.75, establishing a strong quantitative relationship between cancer risk
and total cell division. To dissect the extrinsic vs intrinsic risks, we applied the same
rationale and regressed the smallest cancer risks on any given number of cell divisions (red
line, Fig. 3b). Although we could only find reliable turn-over data for a subset of tissues, it is
remarkable that the conclusion drawn here is nearly identical to that in Fig. 3a, i.e., large
proportions of risks that may not be attributable to intrinsic factors, are mostly higher than

90%. It is important to note that here we included breast and prostate cancers – two high5
incidence cancers missing in the original stem-cell analysis . Again, plausible measurement
errors have been added to the total cell divisions, and the excess risks remained almost
identical (Extended Data Table 1). In summary, irrespective of whether a subpopulation or
all dividing cells contribute to cancer, these results indicate that intrinsic factors do not play
a major causal role.

Epidemiological evidence

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In parallel, numerous epidemiological studies have established strong evidence that many
cancers have substantial risk proportions attributed to environmental exposures (Extended
Data Table 2). Particularly, for breast and prostate cancers, it has long been observed that
large international geographical variations exist in their incidences (5-fold for breast cancer,
14
25-fold for prostate cancer) , and immigrants moving from countries with lower cancer
incidence to countries with higher cancer rates soon acquire the higher risk of their new
15 16
country , . While several risk factors have been identified for these cancers, no single one
can account for their substantial extrinsic risk proportions, suggesting complex mechanisms
for their etiologies. Colorectal cancer is another high-incidence cancer that is widely
17
considered to be an environmental disease , with an estimated 75% or more colorectal
18
cancer risk attributable to diet . For many other cancers, known environmental risk factors
have also been identified. For example, for melanoma, its risk ascribed to sun exposure is
19
around 65–86% , and for non-melanoma basal and squamous skin cancers, ~90% is
20
attributable to UV . At least 75% of esophageal cancer, or head and neck cancer are caused
21 22
by tobacco and alcohol , . It is also well known that certain pathogens may dramatically
23
increase the risk of cancers. For instance, HPV may cause ~90% cases in cervical cancer ,
24
25
~90% cases in anal cancer , and ~70% in oropharyngeal cancer ; HBV and HCV may
26
account for ~80% cases of hepatocellular carcinoma ; and H pylori may be responsible for
27
65–80% of gastric cancer . These, along with many other reports, provide direct evidence
that environmental factors play important roles in cancer incidence and they are modifiable
through lifestyle changes and/or vaccinations.

Author Manuscript

Additionally, analyses of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
Program (SEER) in U.S. between 1973–2012 demonstrate that while many cancers maintain
relatively consistent age-adjusted incidence rates, e.g. esophagus cancer, incidences for some
cancers, including melanoma, thyroid, kidney, liver, thymus, small intestine, extranodal nonHodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), testis, anal and anorectal cancers, have been steadily
increasing and their current incidences are substantially higher than their historical minima
28
in the past 40 years (Extended Data Fig. 1). Moreover, the mortality trend of lung cancer
29
from 1930–2011 , which usually mirrors its incidence trend, shows more than 15-fold
increase for lung cancer risk. These significant increases in incidence suggest that
substantial risk proportions are attributable to changing environments (e.g. smoking and air
pollutants to lung cancers). Collectively, nearly all major cancers have been covered in these
epidemiological studies, further supporting the hypothesis of substantial extrinsic risks for
most cancers. Remarkably, it should be noted that most of these cancers from the
epidemiological and SEER results, except for small intestine (which starts from a very low
risk although it is increasing), are located above the red “intrinsic” risk lines in Figs. 3a & 3b

(blue points), and accounting for the external factors would move them closer to the
proposed ‘intrinsic’ line; thus further supporting the conjecture that the intrinsic line is
mainly defined by cancers without compelling known epidemiological risk whereas those
above are at higher risks due to extrinsic factors.

Analysis of mutational signatures

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Besides epidemiological studies, we evaluated recent studies on mutational signatures in
cancer. These are regarded as fingerprints left on cancer genomes by different mutagenic
30
31
processes , revealing ~30 distinct signatures among various cancers . Analysis of these
signatures was therefore used to shed light on the proportion of intrinsic versus extrinsic
origins of cancer. Two signature mutations, 1A/1B, demonstrated strong positive correlations
with age in the majority of cancers, suggesting that they are acquired at a relative constant
rate over the lifetime of cancer patients and thus likely result from intrinsic processes;
however, all other signature mutations (~30) lack the consistent correlations with age,
suggesting they are acquired at different rates in life and thus probably a consequence of
31
extrinsic carcinogen exposures . Indeed, several mutational signatures have been linked to
31
known factors such as UV and smoking . We therefore categorized the signatures into
intrinsic (type 1A/1B) and extrinsic mutations with known or unknown factors, and
summarized their corresponding percentages in the Extended Data Table 3. Significantly,
many cancers have substantial extrinsic mutations with known factors. More importantly,
15
cancers known to have substantial environmental risk proportions, e.g. Breast cancer ,
16
18
19
21
Prostate cancer , Colorectal cancer , Melanoma , Head & Neck cancer , Esophageal
22
23
26
27
cancer , Cervical cancer , Liver cancer , and Stomach cancer , all harbor large
percentages of total extrinsic mutational signatures. This suggests that the percentages of
total extrinsic mutational signatures can serve as a good surrogate for extrinsic cancer risks.
While a few cancers have relatively large proportions of intrinsic mutations (>50%), the
majority of cancers have large proportions of extrinsic mutations, for example, ~100% for
Myeloma, Lung and Thyroid cancers and ~80–90% for Bladder, Colorectal and Uterine
cancers, indicating substantial contributions of carcinogen exposures in the development of
most cancers.

Modeling theoretical intrinsic risk

Author Manuscript

Lastly, in another independent, model-driven approach to dissecting the risk contribution of
the intrinsic processes, we modeled the potential lifetime cancer risk due to intrinsic stemcell mutation errors by varying the number of hits (i.e. driver gene mutations), denoted by k,
required for cancer onset. We derived the probability distribution of the propagation of driver
gene mutations from one generation to the next, and subsequently established the theoretical
relation between cell divisions and the degree of lifetime cancer risk due to intrinsic cell
mutation errors alone, which we refer to as the theoretical lifetime intrinsic risk (tLIR). To
5
overcome the limitation of inaccurate estimation in the reported stem cell numbers , we
calculated tLIR using both the reported stem cell number (tLIRsc) and the total tissue cell
number (tLIRtt). The latter is equivalent to assuming all homeostatic tissue cells to be stem
cells, representing an extreme overestimation of tissue stem cells, which consequently leads
to a conservative estimation of the upper bounds in tLIR. The somatic mutation rate in

tumors is estimated to be 5 × 10−10 per nucleotide site per cell division – . Based on this,
in our initial calculation, we used an intrinsic mutation rate (r) of 1 × 10−8 per cell division,
which is equivalent to approximately 20 mutable nucleotide sites for each driver gene where
the driver will mutate if at least one site mutates. As shown in Figs. 4a and 4b, if only one hit
(that is, mutation of one designated driver gene) is required to develop cancer, i.e. k = 1, the
lifetime risk for almost all cancers is close to 100%. This confirms that one mutation is not
enough for cancer onset (otherwise everyone would theoretically acquire each type of
cancer). If two driver gene mutations are needed, k = 2, the modeled intrinsic risk becomes
small for cancers with small total number of stem-cell divisions; however it is still very large
for those with higher stem-cell divisions and even unreasonably large for some cancers by
surpassing the corresponding observed total lifetime cancer risks (Adjusted Basal, COAD,
Adjusted Melanoma, Small Intestine, AML and Duodenum). Therefore, it is unlikely that, at
least in these cancers, two hits will suffice to induce cancer. Now, if we consider the more
35
reasonable case where three mutations are required , k = 3, almost all modeled intrinsic
risks (both tLIRsc and tLIRtt) drops well below our earlier “intrinsic” risk lines estimated
conservatively from the observed data alone (red dashed lines estimated based on observed
data following the same mechanism as Fig. 3a). The lifetime risk drops even further for k =
4 and beyond. The extrinsic risks based on the tLIRsc and tLIRtt have been summarized in
the Extended Data Table 4. Therefore, this modeling approach demonstrates that cancer risk
due to intrinsic stem-cell mutation errors alone is low for almost all cancers that require over
2 mutations, indeed it is lower than the relatively conservative estimate based on data alone
(red lines). Since the driver-gene mutation rate in stem-cell division is a key parameter, we
further conducted sensitivity analyses with different rates (r = 1 × 10−10 to 1 × 10−6) to
examine how this may impact the tLIR (Extended Data Fig. 2 and 3). The results show that
for k = 3, when r < 1 × 10−7 (~200 sites for each driver-gene hit), almost all modeled
intrinsic risks are below the observed “intrinsic” risk line (red lines); when r = 1 × 10−6
(~2000 sites for each driver-gene hit), the majority of modeled intrinsic risks are still well
below the observed “intrinsic” risk lines, particularly those with small total number of
divisions (Extended Data Fig. 2). For k = 4, when r < 1 × 10−6, almost all modeled intrinsic
risks are below the observed “intrinsic” risk lines estimated through the data-driven
approach (Extended Data Fig. 3). These sensitivity analyses demonstrate that our
conclusions are highly robust, and that the attribution of intrinsic mutations to lifetime
cancer risk through stem-cell divisions, particularly for those cancers with low risk, is rather
small, even using widely different intrinsic mutation rates.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we find that a simple regression analysis cannot distinguish between intrinsic
and extrinsic factors. We have provided a new framework to quantify the lifetime cancer
risks from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors based on four independent approaches that are
data-driven and model-driven, with and without using the stem-cell estimations. Importantly,
these four approaches provide a consistent estimate of contribution of extrinsic factors of
>70–90% in most common cancer types. This concordance lends significant credibility to
the overall conclusion on the role of extrinsic factors in cancer development.

Derivation of the probability of possessing k hits after n cell divisions for one cell

Author Manuscript

Based on the theory of the clonal stem-cell origin of cancer, in a given tissue, the stem cell
would first go through m rounds of symmetric divisions (for each division, each stem cell
would divide into two daughter stem cells) to reach a total of S stem cells (S = 2m) at the
steady state. Subsequently, these S stem cells would go through a rounds of asymmetric
divisions (for each division, each stem cell would yield only one daughter stem cell)
throughout the lifetime of the tissue. This means the total number of lifetime stem cell
divisions/generations is: n = m + a. Information on the total number of symmetric and
asymmetric divisions as well as the total number of stem cells in steady state for various
tissues discussed in this work has been extracted from Table S1 of the supplementary
5
materials in Tomasetti and Vogelstein . With k hits (mutations of k predetermined driver
genes) on a stem cell required for cancer onset, the number of possible cell state at a given
(stem cell) generation would be k +1, including a zero state with no hit. If we assume that
once a hit occurs, it cannot be reversed and therefore be carried to all progeny cells, then a
cell state may only transit from lower to higher or equal levels from generation to
generation. In the Extended Data Fig. 4, we demonstrate with k = 3 the state transitions of
accumulating driver gene mutations. Let Xg denote the number of driver mutations
accumulated at generation g and r be the intrinsic driver gene mutation rate due to random
errors during DNA replication, the transition probabilities from generation g to g + 1 for all
possible states (0 ≤ i ≤ k) are derived as follows:

where n is the total number of divisions that one stem cell may experience during
its life time.
Derivation of the theoretical lifetime intrinsic risk (tLIR) of cancer for a given tissue

Author Manuscript

As mentioned afore, for stem cells in a specific tissue, we assume they undergo two phases
of divisions (Extended Data Fig. 5): (1) a total of m symmetric divisions before full tissue
development, and (2) a total of a asymmetric divisions for normal tissue turnovers. So in a
fully developed tissue, there are a total of S = 2m stem cells. For each stem cell, its
probability of possessing all k hits for cancer onset after n = m + a divisions is P(Xn = k),
which can be calculated from the previous part. Therefore, the theoretical lifetime intrinsic
risk (tLIR) of developing cancer, i.e., the probability of at least one stem cell containing k
hits during its life time, can be expressed as:

Estimating cancer risk for different tissues

Author Manuscript

The numbers of symmetric and asymmetric divisions for different tissues were adopted from
5
Table S1 in the supplementary materials of Tomasetti and Vogelstein . In particular, the
number of symmetric divisions, m, is equal to the integer part of log2 S where S is the
5
number of normal stem cells in tissue of origin in the Table S1 , and the number of
5
asymmetric divisions, a was the column labeled d in Table S1 . Sensitivity analyses have
been conducted for scenarios with a broad range of mutation rates, from 1 × 10−10 to 1 ×
10−6, and several required hits (k = 1, 2, 3, 4).
Lower-bound estimates of extrinsic risks with the SEER data

Author Manuscript

As a program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results Program) is a source of information on cancer incidence and survival in the
United States (http://seer.cancer.gov/). The age-adjusted cancer incidences were extracted
from the database “SEER 9 Regs Research Data, Nov 2014 Sub (1973–2012) <Katrina/Rita
28
Population Adjustment>”, by using the SEER*Stat 8.2.1 . For several cancers, it has been
observed that their incidence rates have increased dramatically during the past 40 years
(Extended Data Fig. 1). For these cancers, it is reasonable to conjecture that anything above
the historical minimum incidence should be attributed to some environmental/extrinsic
factors. Therefore, we can establish the following inequality:

Correspondingly, the lower bounds of contributions by extrinsic factors for these cancers can
be calculated. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 1, some cancers show substantial
contributions from extrinsic factors.
Data and Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

The observed life time cancer risks and the cumulative number of divisions (n) of all stem
cells per lifetime are adopted from Table S1 of the supplementary materials by Tomasetti
5
and Vogelstein . The total tissue cell divisions are from our evaluation of the data
(Supplementary Information). For the robustness analysis of Fig. 3 as tabulated in Extended
Data Table 1, error terms following the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard
deviations of 1 or 0.4 were added to the log10(total stem-cell division) or log10(total cell
division). These allows the number of total stem-cell and cell divisions to vary
approximately within a range of (1/100 ~ 100) or (1/5 ~ 5) fold(s), respectively. Based on the
new data set with measurement errors, the excess risks for each cancer were quantified. This
process is repeated for 1,000 times, based on which the mean, the 2.5% and the 97.5%
percentiles (namely the 95% confidence intervals) of the excess risk for each cancer are
tabulated. In computing the percent of intrinsic versus extrinsic mutations based on
mutational signatures from cancer genome, we define the intrinsic mutation as those with
signatures 1A/1B, and extrinsic mutation as all other mutational signatures (2–21, R1–R3,
U1 and U2). The corresponding data were obtained from the supplemental figures 59–88 in
31
Alexandrov et al . All statistical analyses and mathematical calculations were performed
using R version 3.1.2.

Extended Data Table 3

Percentages of intrinsic vs. extrinsic mutational
signatures (MS) with known and unknown causes in
different cancer types
Intrinsic MS includes signatures 1A/B, and extrinsic MS includes signatures 2–21, R1–R3,
U1 and U2, excluding signature 11 for Temozolomide, an alkylating agent used for
chemotherapy. The blue, yellow and red colors highlight cancers that are have substantial
extrinsic risk proportions based on epidemiological, MS with known causes and, MS with
unknown causes, respectively. (Data from the supplemental figures 59–88 in Alexandrov et

Figure 1. A schematic view of how intrinsic processes and extrinsic factors are related to cancer
risks through stem-cell division

Author Manuscript

This hypothesis maintains the strong role of stem-cell division in imparting cancer risk, but
it also illustrates the potential contributions of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, both
operating through stem-cell division. Other effects, e.g. through division of non-stem cells,
are not considered here.

Figure 2. Correlation analysis of stem-cell division and cancer risk does not distinguish
contribution of extrinsic vs. intrinsic factors to cancer risk

The black dots are data in Fig. 1 (also tabulated in Supplementary Table S1) of the original
5
work by Tomasetti and Vogelstein . The black line was their original regression line. The
blue diamonds represent the hypothesized quadrupled cancer risks due to hypothetical
exposure to an extrinsic factor such as radiation. The blue regression line for the
hypothetical risk data maintains the same correlation as the original black line, albeit
reflecting a much higher contribution of extrinsic factors to cancer risk.

Figure 3. Estimation of the proportion of lifetime cancer risk that is not due entirely to “bad
luck” based
5 on: (a). total tissue stem-cell divisions originally reported in Tomasetti and
Vogelstein , and (b). total tissue cell divisions

Here red dots are cancers used to compute the “intrinsic” risk linear regression lines (red
dashed lines). Blue dots are cancers known to have substantial extrinsic risks from
epidemiology studies. The numbers in parentheses are the estimated percentages of cancer
risks due to factors other than intrinsic risks.

Figure 4. Theoretical lifetime intrinsic risks (tLIR) for cancers based on different number of hits
(k) required for cancer onset

The green (a) and blue (b) dashed lines are the “intrinsic” risk lines estimated based on total
reported stem cell numbers and total homeostatic tissue cells, respectively. The intrinsic
stem cell mutation rate (r) is assumed to be 1 × 10−8 per cell division. The red dashed lines
are the “intrinsic” risk lines estimated based on the observed data using the same mechanism
as Fig. 3a. Adj. Basal and Adj. Melanoma represent cancer risks after adjusting for the effect
of sun exposure and UV.
