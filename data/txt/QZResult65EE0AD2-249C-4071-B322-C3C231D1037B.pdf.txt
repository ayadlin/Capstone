ABSTRACT
microRNAs constitute a complex class of pleiotropic post-transcriptional
regulators of gene expression involved in the control of several physiologic and
pathologic processes. Their mechanism of action is primarily based on the imperfect
matching of a seed region located at the 5’ end of a 21-23 nt sequence with a partially
complementary sequence located in the 3’ untranslated region of target mRNAs. This
leads to inhibition of mRNA translation and eventually to its degradation. Individual
miRNAs are capable of binding to several mRNAs and several miRNAs are capable
of influencing the function of the same mRNAs. In recent years networks of miRNAs
are emerging as capable of controlling key signaling pathways responsible for the
growth and propagation of cancer cells. Furthermore several examples have been
provided which highlight the involvement of miRNAs in the development of resistance
to targeted drug therapies. In this review we provide an updated overview of the
role of miRNAs in the development of melanoma and the identification of the main
downstream pathways controlled by these miRNAs. Furthermore we discuss a group
of miRNAs capable to influence through their respective up- or down-modulation the
development of resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

Immunotherapy is mostly based on immune checkpoint
inhibitors targeting CTLA4 and, more recently, PD1/PDL1
interaction [3]. Targeted therapies with MAPK pathway
kinase inhibitors (KIs) have been developed thanks to the
discovery that BRAF and NRAS mutations are among the
major oncogenic drivers of melanoma proliferation and
survival [4].
Approximately 50% of patients harbor v-raf
murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF)
V600 mutations [5]. In 90% of cases BRAF mutations
change Valine 600 into glutamic acid (V600E) [5]. Less
frequently substitution with other aminoacids (V600D,
V600R) is observed [5]. BRAFV600 mutated oncogenes
lead to the uncontrolled activation of the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway

Malignant melanoma is a neoplasm of melanocytes
and its incidence has increased dramatically over the
past few decades [1]. Surgery is still the main and
definitive treatment for early-stage melanoma, but it is
rarely curative for the advanced stages of melanomas
[1]. Chemotherapy represents the past for the treatment
of metastatic melanoma and it was based on 2 FDAapproved drugs: fotemustine, dacarbazine [2]. In recent
years, however, advances in the use of immunotherapy
and targeted therapy have revolutionized clinical history
of this disease thanks to their ability to significantly
enhance proportion and duration of objective responses
and to provide extended prolongation of patients’ survival.

and act as the main oncogenic drivers of melanoma
progression and proliferation [6]. These evidences lead
initially to the clinical development of BRAF inhibitors,
such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib, which are selective
inhibitors of BRAF-V600 mutated oncogenes and have
been approved by FDA [7, 8]. BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi)
are active only in melanoma cells bearing V600 BRAF
mutations, where this kinase is present as constitutively
active monomers. In contrast BRAFi exert a paradoxical
tumor promoting effect in RAS mutated melanomas where
they induce the allosteric activation of heterodimeric
complexes formed by mutated and wild-type BRAF
monomers [9]. Single-agent vemurafenib and dabrafenib
demonstrated unprecedented objective responses and
improvements in progression-free and overall survival in
patients with metastatic melanoma bearing BRAF V600E
mutation, as compared to old chemotherapy approaches
[10]. However, the duration of response was limited in
time and the median progression free-survival extended
only to 6-8 months because of the development of drug
resistance [11, 12].
Acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors is usually
characterized by reactivation of the MAPK pathway
[13, 14]. Furthermore, the scenario is complicated by
the paradoxical development of secondary skin tumors,
which may arise from the BRAF inhibitors-induced
activation of MAPK pathway in wild-type BRAF cells
[15]. For these reasons more recently the gold standard
of therapy for BRAF mutated melanoma has become
the combinations of different BRAF inhibitors (such as
vemurafenib, dabrafenib and very recently encorafenib)
with MEK inhibitors (such as trametinib, cobimetinib or
binimetinib) [16-20]. These combinations significantly
increase the percentage of objective responses, prolong
overall and progression-free survival compared to singleagent therapies and mitigate the emergence of resistance.
However, also dual inhibition inevitably fails in the long
term in the majority of cases [21, 22].
Several studies have been directed to understand
the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance.
The first studies conducted on acquired resistance to
BRAFi monotherapy identified NRAS or KRAS de
novo mutations, mutant BRAF V600E amplification
or its alternative splicing, MEK1/MEK2 mutations or
CDKN2A loss at the basis of resistance [21, 23-25]. All
these molecular alterations converge in the reactivation
of the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, Shi and colleagues,
through an intensive DNA deep sequencing analysis of a
large number of tumor samples from patients resistant to
different BRAFi monotherapies, confirmed that mutations
correlated to the MAPK pathway are evident in the
majority of cases (70%) [26]. Genetic alterations were
found also in the PI3K/PTEN/AKT signalling pathway
in 22% of cases [26]. The scenario is complicated by the
existence of concomitant genetic alterations in both core
drug escape pathways in 18% of cases, which occur in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the same tumor or among multiple tumors from the same
patient [26]. A more recent study also investigated the
mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK
inhibitors [22]. The analysis by whole exome sequencing,
conducted on melanoma tissues from 28 patients suffering
of double-drug disease progression, identified in the
majority of cases (about 68%) molecular alterations in
the MAPK and PI3K/PTEN/AKT signaling pathways,
as previously reported [26], i.e. same genetic alterations,
which occur in the resistance to BRAFi monotherapies
were evident also in the double-drug disease progression
[22]. These studies taken together suggest that also hitting
hard melanoma cells simultaneously with BRAFi+MEKi
combinations does not prevent the activation of escape
mechanisms leading eventually to the selection of
resistant cells bearing activation of the same survival and
proliferation pathways. The question then arises as to
which are these escape mechanisms.
In our opinion the answer can be found in a
better understanding of adaptive epigenetic and/or posttranscriptional mechanisms of resistance. In a significant
percent of cases of drug resistant melanomas (about 26%)
no new mutations have been found [26, 27]. Recent studies
showed that melanoma cells exposed to MAPK inhibitors
undergo early adaptive responses, which help the
emergence of drug resistant cells [28, 29]. We and others,
for example, identified the rapid phosphorylation of the
ErbB3 receptor and the activation of the downstream AKT
pathway as a key event responsible for the development
of resistance to targeted therapies in melanoma through
the activation of a feedback autocrine survival loop
involving increased production the ErbB3 ligand
neuregulin1 (NRG1) [30, 31]. Moreover, we demonstrated
that blocking ErbB3 activity with a combination of
neutralizing antibodies not only abolished early adaptive
responses, but also impaired the establishment of longterm resistance [30, 32].
We believe that a variety of post-transcriptional
adaptive changes orchestrate the development of drug
resistance, which involve also non-coding RNAs. In this
context since microRNAs are important multifunctional
post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression, which
play key-roles in various human cancers [33, 34] it is of
utmost importance to analyze their involvement in drug
resistance. Here we review the emerging role of miRNAs
as key players in melanoma progression and development
of resistance and discuss the potential diagnostic and
therapeutic implications.

MICRORNAS AS MAJOR POSTTRANSCRIPTIONAL MODULATORS OF
GENE EXPRESSION
During the last two decades small non-coding RNAs
have been described as the undisputed protagonists of
the eukaryotic post-transcriptional machinery regulation
22263

Oncotarget

[35]. Among them microRNAs (miRNAs) have become
the subject of the most intensive studies and nowadays
thousands of papers have been published on this matter.
Furthermore there are over 2500 known human miRNAs,
which are recorded in various online available databases
[36]. miRNAs are short RNA about 22 nucleotides long
which were found to be the most expressed class of noncoding RNAs in eukaryotic somatic tissues [33]. Their
main function is the modulation of gene expression
through mRNA silencing or degradation and usually
miRNAs have pleiotropic effects because a single miRNA
is potentially able to target simultaneously several
mRNAs [36, 37]. This feature explains how miRNAs are
such a powerful regulators of gene expression and the
complexity and multitude of cellular pathways they can
affect. miRNAs usually induce the block of translation
and the following destabilization of the mRNA target
through an imperfect binding to its 3’UTR [36]. The 5’end
domain (position 2 to 8) of each miRNAs is responsible
for the recognizing and is called “seed region” [38].
Mature miRNAs, which share identical sequences at
nucleotides 2-8 are generally considered to belong to the
same “miRNA family” [39]. Virtually all mRNAs have
conserved or non-conserved miRNAs binding sites and are

supposed to be under miRNA post-transcriptional control.
Hence, the biogenesis and the regulation of miRNAs
themselves are tightly regulated [39]. The locations of
miRNA sequences are in various genomic contexts and
they are all transcribed, capped and polyadenylated by
RNA polymerase II in a long primary transcript, called primiRNAs [36, 37]. This long transcript is processed into
the nucleus by the Drosha/DGCR8 complex, which chops
the pri-miRNAs generating the pre-miRNA 70 bp long
[36, 37]. pre-miRNAs are exported into the cytosol where
they are processed by the RNAse III Dicer endonuclease
originating the mature miRNA duplex [36, 37]. The mature
miRNA is ready to be loaded together with the Argonaute2
and the transactivation-responsive RNA-binding proteins
to form the RISC complex (RNA-induced silencing
complex) [36, 37]. This complex removes and degrades
the complementary strand and retains the fully functional
miRNA. The perfect or imperfect binding complementary
determines the mRNA fate; indeed in the first case it is
degraded while in the second case it is inhibited in its
translation [38].
miRNAs are classified as “intergenic” or “intronic”
or on the basis of their genomic location and are mostly
situated in clusters [40]. The first ones are transcribed from

their own promoters, while the second ones are encoded by
introns of noncoding or coding transcripts and thus share
the promoter with their host gene expression [40]. Human
miRNA gene clusters are generally co-transcribed, but the
individual mature miRNAs can also be regulated at posttranscriptional levels [39]. Several known transcription
factors, for example p53, MYC, ZEB1 and ZEB2, have
been described as positive or negative regulators of
miRNA expression [39]. Furthermore, miRNA regulation
can be exerted also by epigenetic control through DNA
methylation and histone modifications. miRNA regulation
at post-transcriptional level is carried out through various
mechanisms, such as RNA “tailing” through the addition
of untemplate nucleotide at the 3’ end or adenylation,
through RNA methylation or regulation of RNA stability
by several specific nucleases [39]. miRNAs dysregulation
plays a key-role in various human diseases, especially in
cancer [34]. Of note, different tumor types have specific
miRNA signatures compared not only to healthy tissues
but also to other cancers.
Calin and colleagues were the first to report in 2002
miRNA deregulation in human cancer identifying miR15a/16-1 cluster deletion in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
[41]. This deletion induces the overexpression of the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), which is a target of
these miRNAs [41]. Furthermore, the same investigators
demonstrated that more than half of the known miRNA are
located in genomic regions whose alteration is frequently
reported in human cancers [42]. Nowadays several cancerassociated miRNAs are known, which are described to act
as oncosuppressor miRNAs or oncomiRs. Examples of the
first ones are: miR-15/16, let-7, miR-200, miR-34, miR107 and miR-126, whereas examples of the second ones
are: miR-221/222, miR-21 and miR-10b [37].

respectively. Comparison of the first with the second
list revealed 18 miRNAs inversely regulated, namely
upregulated in early progression and downregulated when
MIA was knocked down and viceversa. In a third type
of analysis comparison of miRNA expression between
primary melanomas and metastatic samples led to the
identification of a smaller set of dis-regulated miRNA,
namely 11 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated which were
thus considered to be involved in metastatic colonization
of melanoma cells.
A similar study was carried out by Caramuta et al
[44], who compared miRNA expression profiles in clinical
samples of melanoma metastasis, melanoma cell lines
and normal melanocyte cultures. They focused on 167
miRNAs, which were clustered in relation with clinical
characteristics, patient survival, and mutational status for
BRAF and NRAS [44]. These researchers, performed
two types of analysis to identify miRNAs deregulated
in melanomas vs melanocytes. A significant analysis of
microarray (SAM) analysis identified 32 most important
deregulated miRNAs, of which 13 overexpressed and 19
down-regulated. In addition the Prediction Analysis of
Microarrays (PAM) method revealed a minimal miRNA
signature composed of 10 miRNAs capable to distinguish
the two groups with a prediction accuracy of 100%. Of
note, among these miRNAs, miR-126 had been identified
in the previous study by Mueller et al [43]. Furthermore,
applying the same PAM analysis Caramuta et al. identified
six candidates miRNAs that could predict disease outcome
[44]. Among them two were validated by RT-PCR, miR191 and miR-193b. High expression of miR-191 was
confirmed to be highly correlated with better survival,
while high expression of miR-193b was confirmed to
correlate with poorer survival respectively [44].
Chan et al analyzed the expression of a panel of 384
miRNAs between 42 patient derived primary melanomas
samples with three normal melanocyte control samples
and found eight miRNAs to be differentially expressed
[45]. Of these eight, two, miR-183 and miR-135b are
present in the signature identified by Muller et al [43],
while other two, namely miR-132 and miR-211 in the
signature by Caramuta et al [44]. The same authors
observed that miRNA expression profiles are able to
distinguish among melanoma subtypes such as acral
versus non non-acral melanomas [45]. Among their most
interesting observations was that out of 32 non-acral
melanoma samples genotyped for a KRAS oncogene
variant located in the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR)
and known to be affecting the binding site for miRNAs,
25% were positive for the KRAS-variant, thus suggesting
the association of this variant with the increased risk of
developing melanomas. When they compared the KRASvariant group and the non-KRAS-variant one, they found
the significant down-regulation of only one miRNA,
miR-137 [45]. Of notice, among the genes reported to
regulate or to be regulated by miR-137 the most relevant

MICRORNA DEREGULATION IN
MELANOMA DEVELOPMENT AND
PROGRESSION
In the last years several studies have analyzed the
involvement of miRNA in the progression of metastatic
melanoma [43-53]. We will summarize here below the
findings of a number of representative studies.
Mueller and colleagues were the first to study
differential miRNA expression between melanocytes and
melanoma cell lines through a microarray-based profiling
[43]. Using stringent criteria (up- or down-regulation more
than 10-fold) they identified 63 miRNAs deregulated
(49 up-regulated and 14 down-regulated) in primary
melanomas vs normal melanocytes, which were considered
to be associated to the early progression of melanoma. In
a second type of analysis the same authors compared the
miRNAome of HMB2 melanoma cells before and after
stable transfection of an antisense melanoma inhibitory
activity (MIA) construct. Here they observed a reverse
trend, namely 12 up- and 34 down-regulated miRNAs

is micropthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)
[54].
In addition to large profiling data above described
some specific miRNAs have been the object of further
investigations during the last years. Let-7a, for example,
which is a member of a known family of oncosuppressor
microRNAs, has been reported to be downregulated in
melanoma cells compared to melanocytes [55]. Moreover,
this miRNA targets human integrin β3, which has a wellknown role in melanoma progression and invasion.
Through experiments of transient in vitro overexpression
and luciferase assays, was it possible to link the upregulation of integrin β3 occurring in melanoma cells to
the amount of let-7a present in the cell, thus demonstrating
that this miRNA has an oncosuppressive role in melanoma
[55]. Moreover recent findings have attributed to this
miRNA a key role in regulating energy metabolism in
cancer cells by mediating mitochondrial ROS production
with the concomitant up-regulation of oxidative stress
responsive genes [56]. Another miRNA, which specifically
controls melanoma cell invasion is miR-339-3p. This
miRNA has been identified by a comprehensive functional
screen of a human miRNA mimetic library in a cell-based
assay for invasion [57]. This miRNA targets myeloid cell
leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1), a well-known oncogene
in several human malignancies, including melanoma [58].
In addition miR-339-3p enforced expression is able to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

affect melanoma cell invasion not only in vitro, but also
in a model of lung colonization in T-cells deficient mice
[57]. Moreover our group very recently identified a novel
oncosuppressive miRNA in metastatic melanoma, miR579-3p [59] whose involvement in melanoma progression
and development of drug resistance will be described in
detail below.
Conversely the following human poly-cistronic
miRNA clusters have been considered to play oncogenic
roles in melanoma. The miR-17/92 cluster, for example,
codes for miR-17, which has been shown to increase the
motility of melanoma cells. miR-17 targets ETV1, which
belongs to the ETS (E-twenty six) transcription factor
family, which has a suppressive role in melanoma [60].
mir-514a is a member of a cluster of miRNAs (miR506-514), which are involved in initiating melanocyte
transformation and promotion of melanoma growth [61].
miR-146a plays a dual role in melanoma malignancy.
Its upregulation during melanoma progression triggers
tumor growth through inhibition of lunatic fringe (LFNG)
and NUMB and activation of the NOTCH/PTEN/AKT
pathway. In contrast its downregulation in Circulating
Tumor Cells (CTC), suppresses tumor dissemination
through modulation of the expression of ITGAV and
ROCK1 [62, 63]. miR-638 is able to promote melanoma
metastasis since it is overexpressed in metastatic lesions
compared to primary melanomas [64]. This miRNA

downregulates TP53INP2 oncosuppressor thus protecting
melanoma cells from apoptosis and autophagia [64].
Lastly, Felicetti et al [65] showed that miR-222, a wellknown oncogenic miRNA, which is encoded together
with miR-221 [66], drives melanoma development and
dissemination. miR-222 is transported in exosomes to
drive melanoma malignancy from miR-overexpressing
cells to the recipient primary melanoma cells [65].
Furthermore it was possible to correlate miR-exosomal
expression to the reduction of known miR-222 target
genes, such as p27, and conversely to the induction of
the PI3K/AKT pathway, thus confirming its functional
implication in melanoma development, as like as in other
human cancers [65].

aberrant expression of a subset of miRNAs in pancreatic
cancer cells. Four miRNAs: miR-7-3, miR-34a, miR-181d,
and miR-193b, have been preferentially associated with
MAPK activity [69]; in particular that the promoter of host
genes for miR-7-3 and mir-34a are both downregulated by
the constitutive activation of MAPK [69]. Therefore there
seems to be a reciprocal capability of selected miRNAs to
regulated of MAPK pathway and viceversa.
The most thorough analysis of the relationship
between the oncogenic BRAF signaling and miRNAs
expression and function in metastatic melanoma was
carried out by Couts at al [70]. The high relevance in
melanoma of oncogenic BRAF-V600 mutations, which
occur in approximately 50% of cases and their impact on
the constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway provided
a strong rationale for this study. First of all miRNA
expression levels were compared between melanocytes
and six BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines through a
sensitive microarray profiling platform [70]. This led
to the identification of more than 30 miRNAs differing
between melanocytes and melanoma cells. Most of them
had not been previously described in melanoma, but were
known to be oncogenic or oncosuppressive in other human
cancers. Among them, for example, miR-17-92 was known
to be associated to tumor progression in lung, colon cancer,
B-cell lymphoma and glioblastoma [71]; whereas miR34a and let-7 family members are known oncosuppressor
miRNAs in lung, breast, prostate, gastric cancer,
pancreatic cancer and neuroblastoma [72, 73]. When
miRNAs expression was analyzed in the same melanoma
cell lines before and after treatment with MEK inhibitors
a reciprocal miRNAs deregulation was observed in more
than half of the cases, thus confirming the correlation

ONCOGENIC BRAF-V600 AND MAPK
SIGNALING ACT IN CONCERT WITH
MIRNA DEREGULATION TO AFFECT
MELANOMA DEVELOPMENT
The RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway has a
central role in sustaining the oncogenic and proliferative
phenotype of melanoma cells, as well as in other human
cancers [67]. For this reason, miRNA involvement in the
regulation of this pathway has been the focus of intensive
research efforts. Let-7 was the first miRNA to be described
to directly target KRAS, one of the most important
members of MAPK pathway, frequently mutated in human
cancers [68]. Furthermore, polymorphisms in KRAS
3’UTR alter let-7 binding, thus resulting in the aberrant
activation of the MAPK pathway in non-small cell lung
cancer [68]. On the reverse MAPK activity results in the

DEREGULATED MIRNAS CONVERGE
ON A SET OF KEY INTRACELLULAR
PATHWAYS

between miRNA deregulation and activation of the MAPK
pathway [70]. In order to provide functional insights on
the deregulated miRNAs, the authors transfected them in
melanoma cells and observed that 14 of them were able
to affect cell proliferation [70]. Seven miRNAs, which
were reduced by BRAF/MAPK signaling pathway, such
as let-7i, miR-34a and miR-22 effectively inhibited
melanoma cell proliferation. On the reverse, seven other
miRNAs, including miR-17 and miR-92/95, which were
up-regulated by BRAF/MAPK signaling pathway were
able to increase cell proliferation. Investigators then
proceeded to identify the molecular pathways and mRNAs
affected by the deregulated miRNAs and were able to
demonstrate through transient transfection and luciferase
experiments that BRAF/MAPK regulated miRNAs
converge on a complex combinatorial control of a specific
set of key cancer regulatory genes involved in cell cycle/
proliferation, adhesion/invasion, signaling and survival
[70]. It was thus possible to conclude that mutated BRAF
exerts multiple regulatory effects on melanomagenesis
through the induction or the repression of a complex
network of miRNAs whose targets are responsible for the
promotion or the suppression respectively of melanoma
growth. However, how this network of miRNAs is
regulated by the constitutive activation of the MAPK
pathway still remains an open question, which will require
further investigation. It has to be added that the association
of BRAF mutational status with miRNA deregulation was
also confirmed in other human cancers. For example in
colorectal cancer (CRC) it was observed that miR-31 is
up-regulated in V600E-BRAF mutated CRCs compared
to wild-type CRCs and this is related to cancer-specific
mortality [74]. As mentioned above the MAPK pathway
can be the reciprocal target of specific microRNAs. This
is the case of miR-340. Notably miR-340 is able to affect
the expression of 39 out of 45 total RAS-RAF-MAPK
components, such as BRAF, KRAS, NRAS and MYC,
thus reducing melanoma cell growth and migration [75].
Furthermore Liu and colleagues, through a screening
using a high-throughput quantitative real-time miRNA
PCR array, identified miR-524-5p as downregulated
in BRAF mutated melanoma cells but not in wild-type
BRAF cells [76]. miR-524-5p targets both BRAF and
ERK2 genes, which are the key regulators of the MAPK
pathway. Furthermore, the same authors demonstrated that
miR-enforced expression is able to affect melanoma cell
migration and proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, thus
confirming its effect on the inhibition of these two potent
oncogenic members of the MAPK pathway [76].
In conclusion, deregulation of the MAPK pathway
and miRNA epigenetic control strongly influence tumor
cell fate disrupting normal homeostasis in tumors addicted
to this pathway. We represent in the diagram in Figure
1 the most relevant miRNAs identified by the studies
described above, which are regulated or which regulate the
oncogenic BRAF V600/MAPK signaling in melanoma.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Both comprehensive miRNAome profiling studies
[43-53, 70] as well as individual miRNAs analyses [55-65]
described above have shown that deregulation of several
miRNAs contributes to the development of melanoma. The
emerging picture is rather complex because these studies
identified different subsets of miRNAs, thus mirroring the
great degree of heterogeneity of these tumors. However,
since it is known that different miRNAs can modulate the
activity of the same mRNAs or also of different mRNAs
coding for members of the same signaling pathways,
we decided to assessed whether the different miRNA
signatures observed in different studies correspond to
the involvement of the same key signaling pathways. To
test our this hypothesis we decided to analyze in a greater
detail the relationship among the miRNAs identified in the
studies described in the previous paragraphs.
Table 1 lists the most representative deregulated
microRNAs in melanoma subdivided on the basis of the
different studies analyzed: i) Group 1 - miRNA signature
associated with early progression of melanoma by a in
the large profiling approach described by Muller et al
[43]; ii) Group 2 - miRNAs deregulated in melanomas
vs melanocytes by Caramuta et al and Chan et al. [44,
45]; iii) Group 3 -miRNAs resulted to be deregulated by
studies involving individual miRNAs [55-65]; iv) Group
4- miRNA signature associated specifically with BRAF
activation and identified by Couts et al [70]. In table 1
underlined miRNAs are those with possible prognostic
and/or diagnostic role in melanoma as reported in some
published studies [77, 78]. As shown in Figure 2A and
2B, no miRNAs resulted to be in common among the four
groups; we found only one upregulated miRNA (miR126) in common between groups 1 and 2, one upregulated
miRNA in common between groups 3 and 4 (miR-222),
four down-regulated miRNAs (miR-196a, miR-374,
miR-454-3p and miR-324-5p) in common between the
same groups 1 and 2 and two downregulated miRNAs in
common between groups 2 and 4 (let-7i and miR-211).
In order to verify if the deregulated miRNAs,
reported in Table 1, are able to target same mRNAs and/
or signaling pathways, we predicted the putative target
mRNAs for all these miRNAs, subdivided in the four
groups indicated above, using three online available tools,
a) TargetScanHuman [79], b) PITA [80], and c) Miranda
[81]. We applied to our analysis stringent criteria, by
only selecting mRNAs predicted in common among
all three tools. Then, an enriched functional analysis of
pathways was performed by the Database for Annotation,
Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [82].
The results are shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
Interestingly, we observed a very high overlap among the
mRNAs targets of up- and down-regulated miRNAs [4322269

Oncotarget

45; 55-65, 70]. Most importantly, we identified a number
of commonly deregulated pathways where these targets
are involved (Figure 2C and 2D). In particular, concerning
pathways related to targets of up-regulated miRNAs we
observed (Figure 2C) that five pathways are common
among the four groups. Looking at pathways related to
targets down-regulated by miRNAs (Figure 2D), we found
that six pathways are common among all four groups. Of
note frequently deregulated pathways are Wnt signaling
and other cancer related pathways such as, axon guidance,
endocytosis, melanogenesis and calcium signaling (Table
2). The involvement of these pathways in melanoma
development and progression has been abundantly
reported in the literature [83-92]. Wnt signaling, for
example, plays a key role in melanoma development
through β-catenin physiological regulation of epidermal
melanogenesis [84]. Melanoma cells, indeed, exhibit upregulated melanogenesis and defective melanosomes [85].
Another example of deregulated pathway is represented by
axon guidance, a key element in the formation of neuronal
network guided by specific receptors, called plexins [89].

Interestingly both plexins and their guidance molecules
semaphorins are lost during melanoma progression [90,
91]. Most importantly plexins are known to be downregulated by oncogenic BRAF V600 in metastatic
melanoma [92], thus confirming the relevance of this
pathway underlined by our analysis.
In summary, our analysis demonstrates that, while
in different melanoma samples and cell lines there is
a limited or no overlap in the number of individual
miRNAs upregulated or downregulated, on the contrary
the same miRNAs converge on a constant set of
metabolic pathways, which are key to the development of
malignancy.

use of chemotherapy and targeted therapies [93]. However,
durable objective and clinical responses to these therapies
are plagued by the development of chemoresistance
which leads to disease relapse in virtually all metastatic
patients. Although this scenario is changing in recent
years due to the advent of immunotherapy, it has to be
stressed that immunotherapy is effective only in a subset
of patients. Therefore major efforts are still directed to
understand the molecular basis of drug resistance and to
develop combination therapies capable to revert acquired
resistance or, even better, to avoid the development
of resistance. In this context it is of interest to observe
that growing evidences point to miRNAs as key factors
controlling the emergence of drug resistance.
Garofalo et al. for example, first showed that
the oncogenic miR-221/222 induce TRAIL resistance
in aggressive non-small cell lung cancer through the
activation of the AKT pathway, by targeting PTEN and
TIMP3 tumor suppressors [94]. Furthermore, the same
group was able to show that the MET oncogene is involved
in miR-221/222 activation and that miR-130a, by targeting
MET, reduces TRAIL resistance in NSCLC cells through
down-regulation of miR-221/222 [95]. Other investigators,
demonstrated that miR-19 is involved in the regulation
of multidrug resistance (MDR) through the inhibition of
the oncosuppressor gene PTEN, thus increasing breast
cancer cells resistance to chemotherapeutic agents [96].
Most important miRNAs [61, 59, 94-104, 106, 108]
with an impact on the establishment of drug resistance
in human cancers are reported in Table 3 and 4. Coming
back to metastatic melanoma only few studies have
been published about the relationship between miRNAs
and drug resistance especially in the context of BRAFi/
MEKi based targeted therapies. miR-214, for example,
is supposed to play a role in chemoresistance because
it has been shown to reduce melanoma cells apoptosis
by facilitating survival in adhesion-lacking (anoikis)
conditions [105] and also because it is able to modulate
drug resistance in many other human cancers, such as
lung, ovarian, breast and cervical cancers [106]. However,
until now, no study of miR-214 involvement in melanoma
drug resistance has been published. In this regard it is
important to point out that some miRNAs, such as miR638 and miR-579-3p, have been also described to affect
melanoma cell apoptosis alone or in presence of BRAF
inhibitors treatments [59, 64].
Some miRNAs act as “facilitators” of drug
resistance. One such example was provided by Stark et
al. who suggested the potential involvement of mir-514a
in the modulation of sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors in
melanoma cells [61]. These investigators showed that
NF1, a known tumor suppressor [107], is a direct target
of miR-514a [61]. Both NF1 direct silencing by specific
silencing with siRNA, and miR-514a upregulation leading
to decreased NF1 levels were able to strongly decrease
drug sensitivity in short term “in vitro” cell proliferation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

assays [61]. However this study did not ask the direct
question of whether up- or down-regulation of miR-514a
expression is capable to affect the development of long
term resistance and the emergence of resistant melanoma
cell populations. Also no effort was made to determine
changes in the expression of miR-514a between “ drug
sensitive” vs “drug resistant” tumor samples derived from
patients.
Very recently, it has been shown that BRAF
inhibitors induce adaptive cell response via cytokine
production with a strong cross-talk with miRNAs
deregulation, which act as facilitators of drug resistance.
Vergani and colleagues proposed that BRAFi-resistant
melanoma cells up-regulate chemokine monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2), which in turn activate
the expression of miR-34a, miR-100 and miR-125b
[108]. These miRNAs activation is orchestrated by HIF1
transcription factor [109], which is also known to regulate
CCL2 secretion [108]. In line with these findings miR-34a,
miR-100 and miR-125b were found to be up-regulated in
BRAFi resistant melanoma cell lines and in the biopsies
from patients undergoing vemurafenib treatments [108].
Vergani and colleagues’ data are consistent with previous
published studies, which evaluated miR-125b, miR-34a
and miR-100 involvement in chemoresistance in other
tumors through the targeting of proapoptotic genes [108].
An opposite mechanism of action has been
attributed to miR-200c, member of a family of known
oncosuppressive miRNA [110]. This miRNA has been
proposed to counteract the establishment of drug resistance
in melanoma by directly targeting Bmi-1, a critical factor
involved in the maintenance of stem cells [111]. miR200c enforced expression reduced the expression of three
members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters,
which mediate chemoresistance in melanoma, thus
increasing both targeted therapies and chemotherapy
mediated reduction of melanoma cell growth [111]. Also,
the biological effects induced by miR-200c overexpression
were phenocopied by BMI inactivation. On the reverse,
loss of miR-200c increased Bmi-1 expression, thus
leading to downregulation of E-cadherin, uppregulation
of N-cadherin, and therefore mesenchymal to epithelial
transition (MET), upregulation of ABC transporters and
activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK survival pathways
[112]. Finally miR-200c was shown to be downregulated
in melanomas that acquire resistance to BRAF inhibitors
compared to pretreatment tumor biopsies, in which its
target genes are conversely up-regulated [112].
Finally, our group, which studies the mechanisms
responsible for the establishment of drug resistance
in melanoma [30, 32, 113], has identified a novel
miRNA, miR-579-3p as a master regulator of melanoma
progression and drug resistance [59]. This miRNA
belongs to the miR-548 family, which is emerging as a
new family with oncosuppressive role in several human
tumors, including breast, ovarian, brain, lung, colon and
22271

Oncotarget

cervical cancers [114]. We identified miR-579-3p through
the online algorithm miRò, by querying potential miRNA
deregulated during melanoma progression in relationship
with BRAF mutational status [115]. Of note we found that
this miRNA has two seed regions that match the 3’-UTR
of BRAF [79, 116]. We confirmed, through luciferase and
transient overexpression assays its ability to target miR579-3p and concordantly with these data the reduction of
melanoma cell growth and migration. In addition miR579-3p targets and inhibits the MDM2 oncoprotein [117].
Moreover, we found that low miR-579-3p expression
correlates with worse prognosis in melanoma patients and
that its expression is further decreased in BRAFi/MEKi
resistant melanoma cells. In this regard we observed that
miR-579-3p enforced expression both potentiates BRAF
and/or MEKi anti-proliferative effects and impairs the
establishment of resistance to BRAF inhibitors in longterm clonogenic assay. Most importantly using matched
tumor samples from melanoma patients before and after
development of resistance, we observed that miR-579-3p
is strongly downregulated in tumor biopsies from the same
patient after the development of resistance and that this
coincides with a reciprocal regulation of the expression
of its target oncogenes BRAF and MDM-2 [59]. We are
currently investigating the role of a large network of
deregulated miRNAs as major players in the establishment
of drug resistance in melanoma through the analysis of
the whole miRNome profile during the development of
resistance. Our unpublished results highlight a gradual
deregulation of a growing number of miRNAs, which
rewire a complex network of intracellular pathways.	
All together these studies point to the involvement of
a number of miRNAs either as promoters or as antagonists
of resistance (see Table 3 and 4) and show a complex
mechanism of regulation by which during the progression
of resistance the first groups undergoes upregulation
whereas the second undergoes downregulation. How
is this process coordinated and which are the main
mechanisms controlling the expression of this network of
miRNAs will require further studies.

Importantly, when normal expression of specific miRNAs
is restored in melanomas, reversion of the malignant
phenotype is observed both in in vitro and in in vivo
assays, which demonstrates the central role of miRNA in
disease pathogenesis.
miRNA deregulation, albeit heterogeneous in
different patients and tumor samples (see Figure 1 and 2),
constantly converges in a defined subset of intracellular
pathways. Indeed our bioinformatic analysis of profiling
data from different studies postulates the involvement
of specific pathways such as in particular Wnt, axon
guidance and exocytosis. Although this intriguing finding
will require further validations in the lab, we believe that
identification of pathways commonly deregulated by
miRNAs in melanoma may lead to a better understanding
of disease evolution and to the discovery of additional
targets for therapeutic intervention.
Most important for its therapeutic and diagnostic
implications is the increasing evidence that miRNA
deregulation is heavily responsible for the development
of resistance to target therapies. During the development
of resistance melanoma select cells with low expression
of selected miRNAs, such as miR-200c and miR-579-3p,
two potent oncosuppressors acting apparently on different
and complementary pathways [59, 111, 112]. Restoration
of their expression potentiates the effect of MAPK
pathway inhibitory drugs and impairs the establishment
of resistance. While it will be important in the future
to dissect the molecular mechanism leading to their
downregulation, from a therapeutic perspective our strong
hope is on the improvement of robust in vivo delivery
technologies for miRNA mimics capable to restore their
normal expression profile in the tumor [119]. Finally,
since miRNAs are very stable in human fluids compared
to mRNAs because they could be packaged in exosomes
or associated with RNA-binding proteins or lipoprotein
complexes, which protect them from degradation [120,
121], deregulated miRNA could be used as successful
biomarkers in patient plasma and serum, able to early
predict resistance to therapies [122-125].

CONCLUSIONS

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) allowed the
identification of four genetic subtypes of cutaneous
melanoma, BRAF mutant (the most common condition
responsible for more than 50% of cases), RAS mutant,
NF1 mutant, and Triple Wild-Type [118]. Mutations in
each of the major driver genes, BRAF, RAS, and NF1,
all contribute to deregulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway,
leading to uncontrolled cell growth. As recapitulated in
this review genetic changes trigger a complex rewiring
of intracellular pathways, which involve as major players
several microRNAs. How this is accomplished, i.e.
how MAPK/ERK deregulation influences the pattern of
microRNA expression remains still largely unexplored.
