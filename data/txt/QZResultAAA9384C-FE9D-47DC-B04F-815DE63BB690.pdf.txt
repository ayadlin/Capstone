ABSTRACT:
Limited improvement in long term survival of lung cancer patients has been
achieved by conventional chemotherapy or targeted therapy. To explore the potentials
of tumor initiating cells (TIC)-directed therapy, it is essential to identify the cell targets
and understand their maintenance mechanisms. We have analyzed the performance of
ALDH/CD44 co-expression as TIC markers and treatment targets of lung cancer using
well-validated in vitro and in vivo analyses in multiple established and patient-derived
lung cancer cells. The ALDHhiCD44hi subset showed the highest enhancement of stem
cell phenotypic properties compared to ALDHhiCD44lo, ALDHloCD44hi, ALDHloCD44lo
cells and unsorted controls. They showed higher invasion capacities, pluripotency
genes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factors expression, lower
intercellular adhesion protein expression and higher G2/M phase cell cycle fraction.
In immunosuppressed mice, the ALDHhiCD44hi xenografts showed the highest tumor
induction frequency, serial transplantability, shortest latency, largest volume and
highest growth rates. Inhibition of sonic Hedgehog and Notch developmental pathways
reduced ALDH+CD44+ compartment. Chemotherapy and targeted therapy resulted
in higher ALDHhiCD44hi subset viability and ALDHloCD44lo subset apoptosis fraction.
ALDH inhibition and CD44 knockdown led to reduced stemness gene expression and
sensitization to drug treatment. In accordance, clinical lung cancers containing a
higher abundance of ALDH and CD44-coexpressing cells was associated with lower
recurrence-free survival. Together, results suggested the ALDHhiCD44hi compartment
was the cellular mediator of tumorigenicity and drug resistance. Further investigation
of the regulatory mechanisms underlying ALDHhiCD44hi TIC maintenance would be
beneficial for the development of long term lung cancer control.

INTRODUCTION

properties such as self-renewal, differentiation, cell
mobility and toxicity resistance, designated as cancer
stem cells (CSC) or tumor initiating cells (TIC) [6, 7].
Inhibition of morphogenesis regulatory pathways such the
Hedgehog, Notch and Wnt/β-catenin pathways can retard
tumor transplantability, further supporting TIC-targeting
could be useful for lung cancer control [8-11]. However, a
deeper understanding of the cell targets and maintenance
mechanisms is essential for further therapy development.
Lung cancer cells expressing various molecules such
as CD133, CD166, ALDH, CXCR4, GLDC, etc. have
been shown to demonstrate TIC phenotypic characteristics

Lung cancer is the most common malignancy but
curative therapy for metastatic disease is limited. Although
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy achieves a higher
objective response rate and longer progression free
survival in cancers with epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)rearrangement, relapse is the rule after 10-14 months
due to drug resistance [1-5]. Increasing evidences have
shown in many cancers, enhanced tumorigenicity resides
in a tumor cell population that exhibits stem cell-like

[12-15]. On the other hand, to identify TIC with higher
specificity, more stringent selection strategies such as the
adoption of co-expressed markers and verification in larger
numbers of cell lines including patient-derived samples
are advocated. We have previously demonstrated lung
cancer cells with high CD44 expression were enriched
for stem cell-like properties [16]. Moreover, CD44 is
expressed in breast, colon and gastric cancer stem cells
[17-19]. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH) is expressed
in murine embryonic lungs and has been reported to
select for human lung TIC [15, 20, 21]. The specificity
of combined ALDH/CD44 expression as lung TIC marker
compared to either marker alone is not known. In this
study, we have used a range of established and patientderived lung cancer cell lines (PDCL) to show cells with
high ALDH and CD44 co-expression (ALDHhiCD44hi)
possessed in vitro and in vivo TIC properties with
enhanced tumorigenicity and drug resistance compared to
the low-expressing (ALDHloCD44lo) compartment or unselected cells. Simultaneous ALDH inhibition and CD44
depletion as well as pharmacologic inhibition of Hedgehog
or Notch attenuated TIC characteristics. In clinical lung
cancers, recurrence-free survival was longer for patients
with low abundance ALDH/CD44-coexpressing cells (p
= 0.053). Our data demonstrated lung TIC are enhanced
through ALDH and CD44 co-regulating pathways. Further
investigation of the ALDHhiCD44hi population would
enable a better understanding of TIC regulation and
facilitate development of therapeutic strategies for long
term lung cancer control.

only the ALDHhiCD44hi subset was able to differentiate
into all 4 cell populations with similar distribution profile
as the parental cell line while compositions of the other 3
subsets remained largely unchanged from their fresh, postsorting profiles (Figure 1C).
The ALDHhiCD44hi population showed expression
profiles that were characteristic of TIC. They had
significantly higher expression of the pluripotency genes
NANOG, POU5F1 and SOX2 at both the mRNA and
protein levels compared to ALDHloCD44lo and unsorted
populations (Figure 1D to F). They also showed higher
mRNA expression of the epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) transcription factors ZEB1 and SNAIL2,
the mesenchymal gene VIM, the DNA double strand break
repair gene RAD51, the TGFβ/IL6 axis gene IL6ST, and
a lower expression level of the cell adhesion molecule
CDH1 (Figure 1D & E).

ALDHhiCD44hi showed G2/M shift compared to
ALDHloCD44lo subset in cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis showed the ALDHhiCD44hi subset
of H1650 had a significantly higher proportion in G2/M
phase (14.57 ± 3.23%) compared to ALDHloCD44lo (3.74 ±
0.59%, p < 0.05) and unsorted controls (5.81 ± 0.23%, p <
0.01) while cells in G0/1 phase were less abundant (48.42
± 4.48%) than the other populations (ALDHloCD44lo,
71.84 ± 2.58%, p < 0.01; unsorted, 72.06 ± 9.98%, p <
0.05) (Figure 1G). Cell growth kinetics analysis showed
a higher growth rate of ALDHhiCD44hi than unsorted
and ALDHloCD44lo cells (Figure 1H). Correspondingly,
the mRNA expression of the G2/M phase cell cycle
genes CCNB1 and CCNB2 were significantly higher in
ALDHhiCD44hi than either ALDHloCD44lo or unsorted
cells (Figure 1I).

RESULTS
ALDHhiCD44hi population displayed in vitro TIC
properties

ALDHhiCD44hi subset showed the highest
tumorigenicity in immunosuppressed mice

The ALDH/CD44 co-expression profiles of 11
lung cancer cell lines including PDCL and drug-induced
resistant cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. In 6
cell lines, ALDH/CD44 co-expressing cells (ALDH+/
CD44+) comprised the smallest subset with ALDH/
CD44 non-expressing cells (ALDH-/CD44-) forming
the largest population (Supplementary Table S1).
Subsequently, the top/bottom 1 to 5% of cells showing
highest/lowest expression of the markers (ALDHhiCD44hi,
ALDHhiCD44lo, ALDHloCD44hi and ALDHloCD44lo) were
freshly isolated from H1650 and HCC827 cell lines for
further in vitro tests. In the spheroid formation assay, the
ALDHhiCD44hi populations generated more abundant
and larger spheroid bodies than the other 3 subsets
(Figure 1A). In the cell invasion assay, they demonstrated
the highest percentage of invading cells while the
ALDHloCD44lo subset showed the lowest (Figure 1B). In
vitro differentiation in normal culture conditions showed

To test for in vivo tumorigenicity, the 4 freshly
harvested ALDH/CD44 populations and unsorted
controls were transplanted subcutaneously into SCID
mice according to their assigned locations (Figure 2A &
B) from 3 established cell lines and 4 PDCLs. As shown
in Table 1, the ALDHhiCD44hi population of all analyzed
cell lines demonstrated higher graft rates, shorter latency
and larger volumes of xenografts compared to the same
dose of ALDHloCD44hi, ALDHhiCD44lo or ALDHloCD44lo
cells (Figure 2C & D). As few as 500 ALDHhiCD44hi cells
of HCC827 or H1650 but not other populations were able
to initiate tumors at this low seeding dose (Supplementary
Table S2). Interestingly, the HKULC3 cell line, which did
not form xenografts from 108 unsorted cells transplanted
in nude mice for 6 months in our previous study, was able
to initiate tumor in SCID mice from 4,000 ALDHhiCD44hi

cells in 3 months ([22] , Table 1).
Serial transplantation showed ALDHhiCD44hi–
derived tumors had increasing induction frequencies,
reduced latency and increased growth rates in
successive generations compared to the first-generation

transplants (Table 1, Figure 2E & F). In contrast, the
tumor frequencies of ALDHloCD44hi, ALDHhiCD44lo,
ALDHloCD44lo or unsorted cells decreased in the second
and tertiary generations (Table 1).

lung cancer cell populations with differential ALDH/CD44 expressions and unsorted cell controls were kept in serum-free non-adherent

unsorted control. C, In vitro differentiation assay. The 4 freshly isolated populations were separately cultured in adhesive plates containing
normal medium for 2 weeks. Cells were then freshly harvested and re-analyzed by flow cytometry for ALDH/CD44 expression profile. The

ALDHhiCD44hi population showed in vitro and in
vivo resistance to anti-cancer drugs

increase in ALDH+CD44+ proportions (Figure 3B). This
population was also higher in HCC827 induced for
cisplatin-resistance (HCC827-CR) (Figure 3C). Cell
viability to gefitinib treatment was significantly higher
for ALDHhiCD44hi compared to unsorted HCC827 cells
(Figure 3D). Conversely, the apoptotic fractions after
24 hrs cisplatin treatment were significantly higher in
ALDHloCD44lo (p < 0.05) and unsorted H1650 cells (TKIresistant, cisplatin-sensitive) (p < 0.01) while no effect was
observed in the ALDHhiCD44hi population (Figure 3E).
Amongst 5 TKI-treated mice bearing HCC827 xenografts,
only ALDHhiCD44hi-derived tumors persisted after 4-5

The response of ALDH/CD44 subsets to both
targeted drugs and cytotoxic chemotherapy were
compared using in vitro and in vivo models. Gefitinib
treatment of the TKI-sensitive HCC827 (EGFR exon19
deletion) led to significant elevation of ALDH+CD44+ and
ALDH+CD44- subsets (Figure 3A). In cells induced by
chronic exposure to increasing gefitinib dosage (HCC827GR), progressive resistance was associated with stepwise

effects of pharmacological inhibition of Hedgehog and
Notch pathways were analyzed. The expression of sonic
Hedgehog (SMO, GLI1) and Notch (NOTCH1, NOTCH3,
HEY1) pathway genes were significantly higher in
ALDHhiCD44hi compared to ALDHloCD44lo populations in
both H1650 and HCC827 (Figure 4A & B). Cyclopamine
treatment led to mRNA suppression of the Hedgehog
transcription factor GLI1 by >50% while RO4929097
suppressed the Notch transcription factor HES1 by 30%,
respectively (Figure 4C). These treatments resulted in
reduction of the ALDH+CD44+ in both cell lines as well as
inhibited spheroid formation, indicating their involvement

in ALDHhiCD44hi subset maintenance (Figure 4D to 4F).

CD44 knockdown and ALDH inhibition sensitized
tumor cells to in vitro anti-cancer drugs
To investigate the role of ALDH and CD44 in TIC
maintenance, ALDH enzymatic activity was completely
inhibited by DEAB and CD44 was down-regulated with
80-90% reduction in mRNA and protein expression
in multiple cancer cell lines (Figure 5A & B). These
treatments led to a variable reduction of developmental
regulatory genes expression by 30-50% including

lung cancers of mixed histological types showed
ALDH was expressed in 82 (42.5%) and CD44 in 119
(61.7%) cases, respectively (Supplementary Table S4).
ALDH and CD44 expression were both associated with
squamous cell carcinomas (χ2 test, p = 0.035 and p =
0.005, respectively). No association of either marker
with tumor differentiation, pathological stage, patient
gender or smoking history was found. There was no
correlation between cases that showed ALDH and
CD44 expression. Clinicopathological variables such as
gender, smoking history, age, pathological stage, tumor
type, differentiation, and ALDH or CD44 single marker
expression were included in Cox regression multivariate
analysis for recurrence-free survival (RFS), and results
showed the male gender (HR 2.89, 95% CI 1.48-5.63, p =
0.002) and advanced pathological stage (HR 1.96, 95% CI
1.50-2.56, p < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors
associated with shorter RFS.
In 43 (22.3%) tumors, neither ALDH nor CD44
was expressed. In 47 (24.4%) cases, ALDH/CD44 coexpressing cells were detected, including 27 (57.4%)
showing only a few scattered co-expressing cells (low
abundance) and 20 (42.6%) cases that showed large
aggregates or confluent sheets of such tumor cells
(high abundance) (Figure 6A to D). In this group,
survival analysis by log rank test showed there was no
association between RFS and ALDH or CD44 single
marker expression (Figure 6E & F). However, the low
abundance ALDH/CD44 co-expressing group had longer
RFS than the high abundance group (p = 0.053) (Figure
6G). The effect on overall survival did not reach statistical
significance (p = 0.141).

from ALDHhi/CD44hi cells had the highest tumor induction
and growth rate, lowest seeding dose, and shortest latency
in immunodeficient mice that could be serially passaged
for at least 3 generations. Early passage PDCL which are
generally believed to be less adapted to in vitro growth
conditions could be serially transplanted through the
ALDHhiCD44hi subset but much less readily through the
other 3 populations. Compared to CD44 or ALDH single
marker, tumorigenicity was enhanced in cells selected by
ALDHhiCD44hi combined marker ([16] and Supplementary
Table S3). Moreover, the ALDH+CD44+ population and
cell spheres formation were inhibited by pharmacological
disruption of developmental programs such as the sonic
Hedgehog and Notch pathways. The results of these
comprehensive assays showed under de novo experimental
conditions, tumor cells showing the highest expression of
ALDHhiCD44hi combined markers demonstrated enhanced
TIC properties. This marker combination has also been
shown to associate with TIC potentials in head and neck
as well as breast cancers [23, 24].
Interestingly, results of in vitro differentiation
studies were consistent with the expected identity of
ALDHhiCD44hi population as TIC as it yielded 4 progenies
distributed in proportions resembling the parental cell
line while the others remained largely as the original
phenotype lacking differentiation capacity. However,
in the xenografts, tumors derived from all populations
including ALDHloCD44lo showed similar ALDH/CD44
profiles (data not shown). This could be due to phenotypic
plasticity with conversion of non-TIC into TIC under
tumor microenvironment stimulation. Experimentally,
the TGFβ/IL6 axis has been proposed to be involved
in CSC maintenance. We found that exogenous TGFβ
stimulation of HCC827 induced a significant increase
of ALDH+CD44+ cells from 3.63% to 9.38% (p < 0.05)
(Supplementary Figure S1). TGFβ is shown to be involved
in CD44 regulation in breast CSC maintenance while
interleukin 6 (IL6) can promote growth and survival of
glioma stem cells [25, 26]. These data not only caution
against a purely in vitro approach in studying TIC
regulation but also indicate disrupting stroma-cancer
interactions is important in anti-TIC therapy.
One of the major implications of the CSC theory
is that chemotherapy or target therapy effects are mainly
incident on the non-TIC thus compromising long term
cancer control [27-29]. Our in vitro and in vivo results
argue in favor of this hypothesis. The IC50 of gefitinib
was almost 8.5 fold higher for TIC than unsorted cells
of HCC827, while cisplatin produced higher apoptotic
rate in non-TIC than TIC of H1650 (Figure 3). Only
subcutaneous xenografts derived from ALDHhiCD44hi
progenies persisted after intraperitoneal gefitinib
injection. The mechanism mediating the differential drug
resistance is likely to be multifactorial. In both animal
and human studies, ALDH mediates detoxification
and cyto-protection against multiple agents such as

DISCUSSION
Cellular heterogeneity encompassing a TIC
population that carries enhanced tumorigenic potentials has
been demonstrated in many cancers but the mechanisms
maintaining such populations remain unclear. To study the
regulatory mechanisms, the distinction of TIC from nonTIC is required but opinions differ on the most appropriate
method of TIC identification. Some investigators employ
the cell spheroid as an in vitro functional TIC indicator but
the TIC purity, particularly of large spheroids, has seldom
been documented and its applicability in mechanistic
studies is unclear. On the other hand, the employment
of cell surface markers allows the in vitro isolation of a
particular cell population but no single marker has been
found to be universally applicable for all cancers and the
specific scenario being investigated needs to be noted. In
this study, we have employed a series of well-validated
in vitro, in vivo and expression assays to demonstrate the
association of TIC properties with the ALDHhiCD44hi
phenotype in a panel of established lung cancer cell lines
as well as PDCL. Transplantation studies using multiple
cell lines and PDCL consistently showed tumors derived

aldehydes, alkylating drugs, oxidative stress, etc. On the
other hand, through the retinoid signaling pathway, it is
involved in self-renewal and tissue differentiation [30,
31]. For CD44, binding to hyaluronan increases NANOG
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, subsequently
leading to the upregulation and stabilization of multidrugresistant protein 1 (MDR1) for drug export [32]. CD44
interaction with POU5F1-SOX2-NANOG signaling also
plays a pivotal role in CSC maintenance from head and
neck cancers [33]. Together, these date suggest ALDH and
CD44 could mediate drug-resistance directly or through
stem cell regulatory programs. Indeed, in our study,
concomitant CD44 depletion and ALDH inhibition led to
sensitization of resistant cells to gefitinib and cisplatin, as
well as down-regulation of pluripotency genes NANOG,
SOX2 and POU5F1.
Other
potential
mechanisms
enhancing
tumorigenicity and drug resistance of the ALDHhiCD44hi
TIC include a higher G2/M fraction, elevated cyclin
B1 and B2 expression and correspondingly, a higher
population growth rate. This population also showed
elevated expression of the double strand break DNA
repair gene RAD51 which is associated with resistance
to radiation, chemotherapeutic agents and tyrosine
kinase inhibitor therapy [34-36]. Thus, enhanced DNA
damage repair and more rapid cell replenishment could
facilitate maintenance of the ALDHhiCD44hi population.
Furthermore, TGFβ-dependent IL6 secretion has been
shown to contribute to primary and acquired erlotinib
resistance in lung cancer patients [37]. Our data showed
ALDHhiCD44hi population had higher mRNA expression
of the IL6 co-receptor IL6ST, suggesting TGFβ-induced
resistance could reside mainly in TIC.
Expression profiling studies have shown
enrichment of embryonic or tissue stem cell signatures
is associated with increased risk of tumor metastasis,
poor morphological differentiation and adverse patient
outcomes, raising the possibility patient prognosis might
be predicted by an appropriate TIC marker. Previous
reports on the relevance of ALDH or CD44 single marker
have yielded controversial information. For example,
ALDH has been reported both as an adverse and a
favorable prognostic indicator [21, 38]. For CD44, our
previous study has shown a contradictory association
with well-differentiated AD and a longer patient survival
in lung adenocarcinomas [16]. In this study, there was
no statistical evidence of global ALDH and CD44 coregulated expressions. Notably, when analysis was
limited to tumors containing ALDH/CD44-coexpressing
cells, those with a higher abundance of TIC was observed
to associate with a shorter recurrence free survival (p =
0.053). The finding suggested ALDH/CD44 co-expression
could be a useful prognostic indicator and supported the
relevance of these molecules as lung TIC marker. Some
tumors lacked expression of either marker, suggesting
other lung TIC indicators remain to be described.

We have shown comprehensive in vitro, in vivo
data as well as clinical support that the ALDHhiCD44hi
compartment carries TIC capabilities and is the cellular
mediator of drug resistance in lung cancer. These findings
are useful in future studies addressing TIC-related cancer
biology and development of TIC-targeting therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Established human NSCLC cell lines were obtained
from ATCC. PDCL were raised from resected lung cancers
or malignant effusions and only 1st to 5th passage cells
were used for study. Gefitinib or cisplatin-resistant (-GR or
-CR) cells were generated by chronic graded exposure of
parental cells to increasing doses of the respective drugs.
Cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies
Inc.) or ACL4 with 10% FBS [22].

Flow cytometry and fluorescence activated cell
sorting (FACS)
ALDH activity was analyzed by the Aldefluor kit
(Stem Cell Technologies) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, cells were suspended with
activated Aldefluor substrate with or without
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) specific inhibitor
as control at 37˚C for 30 minutes. CD44 expression
was stained by anti-CD44-APC or anti-CD44-PE (BD
Pharmingen) as previously described [16]. Cells were
fixed and permeabilized (Invitrogen) before antibody
incubation for NANOG (Cell signaling), POU5F1
(Chemicon) and SOX2 (Cell signaling) analyses.
Corresponding isotype-matched immunoglobulins were
used as controls (BD Pharmingen). Non-viable cells were
identified by propidium iodide inclusion. Mouse cells were
gated out by Pacific blue-labeled anti-mouse CD31 and
lineage and H-2Kd staining (BioLegend). Flow cytometry
was performed using FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences)
and figures were produced using FlowJo (Tree star). Cells
showing ALDH and CD44 co-expression compared to
staining controls were designated as ALDH+CD44+, those
showing no expression of either marker as ALDH-CD44-,
and those showing either marker only as ALDH+CD44or ALDH-CD44+, respectively. For comparative studies
between different ALDH/CD44 populations, cells showing
the top/bottom 1 to 5% expression levels were freshly
isolated by FACS using BD Aria (BD Biosciences) and
designated accordingly as ALDHhiCD44hi, ALDHhiCD44lo,
ALDHloCD44hi and ALDHloCD44lo populations. Each
batch of cells was re-analyzed after collection to ensure a
purity of > 90%.

80 five times per week for 4-5 weeks [39, 40]. Gefitinib
was dissolved in DMSO; a mixture of 1% Tween 80 with
an equal volume of DMSO was used as vehicle control.

One thousand freshly isolated cells were cultured
in an ultra-low plate (Costar) with serum-free medium
containing FGF, EGF and IGF for 21 days as previously
described [16].

CD44 knockdown, ALDH, Hedgehog and Notch
pathways inhibition

Cell invasion assay

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting human
CD44 and non-targeting siRNA (Qiagen) were used
for CD44 knockdown. Transfection was performed
using Genemute (SignaGen Laboratories) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. DEAB (Sigma) was
constituted in 100% ethanol and diluted in media to 100
µM. The ALDEFLUOR Assay was used in conjunction
with flow cytometry to assess ALDH activity following
DEAB treatment. Cyclopamine (Selleck) or RO4929097
(Selleck) was used for inhibition of Hedgehog or Notch
pathway, respectively.

Cell invasion assay was performed using transwell®
(Costar) coated with matrigel (BD Pharmingen) according
to manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell cycle analysis
Freshly sorted cells were fixed in cold 70% ethanol,
incubated in PBS buffer containing 50 µg/mL propidium
iodide, 100 µg/mL RNAse A and 0.05% Triton X-100 at
37˚C for 45 minutes and analyzed using flow cytometry.
The proportion of cells in G0/G1, S and G2/M was
calculated by FlowJo (Tree star).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ALDH and
CD44 expression in clinical lung cancers
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues
from 193 surgically resected primary lung carcinomas
without neoadjuvent therapy were arrayed on tissue microarray (TMA) with each case represented by 3 to 5 tumor
cores. Tissues from fetal lung, reactive pulmonary lesions
and a representative lung cancer were included in each
TMA block for standardization. IHC for CD44 and ALDH
were performed separately using anti-CD44 standard form
(clone 156-3C11, 1:200 dilution, BiocareMedical) or
anti-ALDH1A1 (1:1000 dilution, Abcam) as previously
described [16]. Primary antibodies were replaced
by SignalStain® Antibody Diluent (Cell Signaling
Technology) in the negative controls. Expression levels
were semi-quantitatively analyzed using an automated
image capturing and analysis system (Aperio) [16].
Briefly, representative tumor areas in each tissue core
excluding stroma, necrosis or inflammatory regions were
gated on the scanned images. The staining intensities and
cell abundance in each annotated area were computed
using standard algorithms. Data from all tissue cores were
integrated and a single score reflecting the abundance
of ALDH or CD44-expressing cells, respectively, was
assigned to each case. For ALDH/CD44-coexpresssion
grading, only co-localized tumor cells with simultaneous
ALDH and CD44 staining were counted. Tumor typing
and pathological staging were according to W.H.O. criteria
[41]. Patient outcomes were collated by the clinician incharge.

Drug sensitivity and apoptosis assays
Drug sensitivity assay was performed by MTT test
and apoptosis was quantified by Annexin V-FITC and PI
staining as previously described [16].

Gene expression analysis
Gene mRNA expression was analyzed by
quantitative RT-PCR (QPCR) (7900HT, Applied
Biosystems) and SYBR green detection. Expressions of
GAPDH and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) were averaged
and used as internal controls. Primers were listed in
Supplementary Table S5.

In vivo tumorigenicity and TKI response
All animal experiments were approved and
performed according to guidelines by the Animal Ethics
Committee, the University of Hong Kong. Briefly, freshly
sorted cells mixed with an equal volume of matrigel (BD
Pharmingen) were injected subcutaneously at the back
of 6-week severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
mice. For serial transplantation, the previous generation
xenografts derived from the respective ALDH/CD44
subsets were digested to obtain single cell suspensions,
stained, subjected to FACS to isolate the parental subset
and transplanted into subsequent recipients. To investigate
the in vivo TKI response, mice bearing xenografts from
HCC827 were subjected to intraperitoneal gefitinib
(Selleck) injections at 50 mg/kg in 0.2 mL of 1% Tween
