ABSTRACT
Bevacizumab is the first-in-class antiangiogenic drug and is almost always
administrated in combination with cytotoxics. Reports have shown that bevacizumab
could induce a transient phase of vascular normalization, thus ensuring a better drug
delivery when cytotoxics administration is adjuvant. However, determining the best
sequence remains challenging. We have developed a mathematical model describing
the impact of antiangiogenics on tumor vasculature. A 3.4 days gap between
bevacizumab and paclitaxel was first proposed by our model. To test its relevance, 84
mice were orthotopically xenografted with human MDA-231Luc+ refractory breast cancer
cells. Two sets of experiments were performed, based upon different bevacizumab
dosing (10 or 20 mg/kg) and inter-cycle intervals (7 or 10 days), comprising several
combinations with paclitaxel. Results showed that scheduling bevacizumab 3 days
before paclitaxel improved antitumor efficacy (48% reduction in tumor size compared
with concomitant dosing, p < 0.05) and reduced metastatic spreading. Additionally,
bevacizumab alone could lead to more aggressive metastatic disease with shorter
survival in animals. Our model was able to fit the experimental data and provided
insights on the underlying dynamics of the vasculature’s ability to deliver the cytotoxic
agent. Final simulations suggested a new, data-informed optimal gap of 2.2 days. Our
experimental data suggest that current concomitant dosing between bevacizumab
and paclitaxel could be a sub-optimal strategy at bedside. In addition, this proof of
concept study suggests that mathematical modelling could help to identify the optimal
interval among a variety of possible alternate treatment modalities, thus refining the
way experimental or clinical studies are conducted.

INTRODUCTION

phase or vasculature normalization with increased tumor
blood perfusion, prior to exerting its antiangiogenics
properties [2–6]. This paradoxical action has been
considered as possibly generating a time-window to
administrate chemotherapeutic agents, thus suggesting
a paradigm shift from concomitant to sequential dosing.
Indeed, delaying chemotherapy could allow higher
quantities of drugs to reach the tumor, provided that their
administration coincides with this normalization phase. As
early as 2004, it has been shown that blocking VEGFR2

Launched in 2004, bevacizumab has been approved
since then in a variety of settings in solid tumors such as
colorectal, breast, lung or ovarian cancers, with mixed
and sometimes still questioned impact on survival [1]. Of
note, bevacizumab has always only been approved as a
concomitant administration with associated cytotoxics.
Several studies from independent academic groups have
suggested that anti-angiogenics could induce a transient

could decrease tumor hypoxia at the beginning of the
treatment, thus demonstrating that transient normalization
of tumor neo-vessels happens indeed with antiangiogenics
[7, 8]. This was already associated with improved
efficacy of combined radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
Indeed, because disrupted tumor vasculature may lead
to resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy due
to subsequent higher interstitial fluid pressure, and
reduced blood flow lowering drug delivery [9], alternate
scheduling with antiangiogenics could overcome these
resistances. Ever since, several groups have worked on
this issue, mostly as part of experimental therapeutics
[4, 6, 10]. Only few clinical trials have investigated on
alternate scheduling with bevacizumab. The BRANCH
study evaluated bevacizumab in rectal cancer patients
after standard concomitant dosing or alternative
sequential administration. Whereas concomitant dosing
was little effective, the sequential administration led
to 50% of tumor regression rate with 85% of 5-years
survival and better tolerance [11]. These promising results
supported the ongoing OBELICS study (Optimization of
BEvacizumab scheduLIng within Chemotherapy Scheme),
a phase-3 trial that will compare different sequences of
bevacizumab associated with chemotherapy [12]. Despite
these encouraging findings, the need for identifying proper
biomarkers to forecast bevacizumab impact on neovessels
remains critical [13] and until they are made available,
in silico tools could be helpful to optimize alternate
schedules. In contrast to the many pharmacodynamic
models describing the action of cytotoxics on tumor
growth [14], and despite substantial theoretical efforts in
the field of cancer modeling to simulate angiogenesis and
tumor-vasculature interactions [15–18], relatively few
mathematical models of anti-angiogenic therapy have been
actually confronted to experimental data [19, 20], and even
less have investigated combined effects of cytotoxics with
antiangiogenics [20, 21]. To address this issue, our group has
developed a phenomenological model describing the effect
of antiangiogenics on vasculature quality throughout time,
thus potentially forecasting when the normalization phase
occurs [22]. When coupled with an efficacy component,
this model should allow to compare in silico differences in
efficacy depending on the lag-time between cytotoxics and
antiangiogenics, thus helping in decision-making prior to
start the actual experiments. As a proof-of-concept study, the
aim of the present work was to confront model simulations
with experimental data generated in a canonical refractory
breast cancer mice model (i.e., MDA-MB231) treated with
a standard combo between anti-angiogenics and cytotoxics
(i.e. bevacizumab-paclitaxel doublet) in this setting.

(Supplementary Figures 1 and 2). These suggested
an optimal gap of 3.4 days, leading to a putative
reduction of 15.4% of the tumor mass as compared to a
concomitant administration. Although based on parameter
values that were not obtained from a quantitative fit to
experimental data, we used this value as a starting point
and fixed a time lag of 3 days in the BEVA/TXL group
of Experiment-1. In this experiment, no difference was
observed in carcass weight among the different treatment
groups (data not shown). Monitoring of tumor growth is
shown in Figure 1A. At the end of the treatment phase
(one week after the third cycle, i.e. D26), mean tumor
mass expressed as % of initial mass were 6339 ± 1999
(Control), 1270 ± 470 (Beva), 1222 ± 372 (TXL), 626
± 234 (BEVA-TXL), 549 ± 245 (BEVA/TXL) and 2260
± 553 (TXL/BEVA). A statistical difference was found
between the groups (p = 0.007, Anova on the Ranks).
Further Dunn’s multiple comparison testing showed that
all treatment groups but BEVA and TXL/BEVA were
different than Control (p < 0.05). At study conclusion
(D78), mean tumor sizes (% of the initial mass) in the
4 remaining groups were 5460 ± 2000 (TXL), 3857
± 1370 (BEVA-TXL), 3560 ± 970 (BEVA/TXL) and
8585 ± 4860 (TXL/BEVA). However, the differences
between the remaining groups at study conclusion
were not statistically significant (p = 0.788, Anova on
Ranks). Survival curves for Experiment-1 are displayed
in Figure 1B. Median survivals were 54 days (Control),
60 days (BEVA), 68 days (TXL), 68 days (TXL/BEVA),
74 days (BEVA/TXL) and 78 days (BEVA-TXL). A
statistical difference in survival was found between the
groups (p = 2.4 10-7), but further log rank testing showed
that survival in the BEVA group was not different than
Control (p = 0.0898), and no significant difference was
evidenced between the BEVA/TXL and the BEVA-TXL
groups (p = 0.214). Metastatic lesions were monitored and
measured using 3D imaging (Supplementary Figure 3).
Three main metastatic sites were found: lymph nodes,
peritoneal carcinosis, and lungs. All the animals had
at least one metastatic site. The kinetics of metastasis
apparition throughout time is displayed in Figure 2C–2E.
Marked differences were observed between the groups and
the metastatic sites, both in terms of time and number of
animals presenting with metastasis. In the Control group,
100% of the mice developed metastasis and all animals
developed secondary lesions on the 3 different sites. Time
to reach 50% animals with at least one metastatic lesion
were 29 days (Control), 33 days (BEVA, TXL, and TXL/
BEVA), 40 days (BEVA-TXL) and 47 days (BEVA/TXL).
Metastasis-free survival analysis (log-rank) revealed a
significant difference between all groups (p = 9.13 × 10-11,
0.0031 and 1.73 × 10-9 for the axillary, peritoneal and lung
locations, respectively). However, significant differences
between the BEVA/TXL and BEVA-TXL groups were
not obtained for any site. Nevertheless, only 30% of the
mice had axillary node invasion at study conclusion in the

To further quantify the metastatic dynamics, a metastatic
index was defined for each group and each location as
the area under the cumulative incidence divided by the
duration of the experiment (78 days in Experiment-1).
This new metrics thus represents the average fraction of
mice with metastasis over the experiment’s duration and
is reported in Figure 1F.
For Experiment-2, Figure 2A shows mean tumor
growth among the groups expressed as % of initial mass.
At the end of the treatment phase (one week after the
third cycle, i.e. day 38), a significant difference was found
between the groups (p = 0.032, Anova on the Ranks).

Further Dunn’s multiple comparison testing showed
that BEVA/TXL group, but not BEVA-TXL group, was
different than Control (p < 0.05). At study conclusion
(D52), mean tumor sizes (% of the initial mass) were
19173 ± 9325 (Control), 10832 ± 2929 (BEVA-TXL),
and 5186 ± 3341 (BEVA/TXL). A significant difference
was found again between the groups (p = 0.012, Anova on
the Ranks). Further Dunn’s multiple comparison testing
showed that BEVA/TXL group, but not BEVA-TXL
group, was different than Control (p < 0.05). The kinetic
of metastasis apparition throughout time depending on
the localization and the treatment group is displayed in
Figure 3B–3D. At study conclusion, in the Control and

and yielded a value of Q– of 0.203 (Figure 3C), suggesting
a 5-fold increase in drug delivery when bevacizumab was
administered first. Figure 3B shows further modeling using
model (2) with dynamic and semi-mechanistic evolution
of the quality of the vasculature depending on the vascular
variables of the model. This last model allowed inference
of unobserved quantities (such as U and S), generating
insights on the dynamics of the system (Supplementary
Figure 4). The dynamics of the quality of the vasculature
Q revealed interesting patterns (Figure 3D). First, it
exhibited an initial drop from a baseline value of 1 to a
low quality, consistently with the reported poor quality
of the tumor vasculature when untreated [8, 23–25].
Then, following the first injection of bevacizumab, the
number of unstable vessels U dropped (Supplementary
Figure 4) while keeping a relatively constant level of
stable vasculature S, resulting in an increase of the quality

BEVA-TXL groups, 100% and 68% of the mice developed
at least one metastasis whereas only 30% of the animals
in the BEVA/TXL group displayed a metastasis. Time
to reach 50% animals with at least one metastatic lesion
was 38 days (Control), 52 days (BEVA-TXL) and was not
reached by study conclusion for BEVA/TXL. Regarding the
metastatic index, the BEVA/TXL group exhibited smaller
values than BEVA-TXL for all locations (Figure 2E). The
animals were necropsied at D60 to compare macroscopic
search for metastatic lesions and 3D imaging. All the
lesions previously identified by bioluminescence were
confirmed upon autopsy (data not shown).
Our two mathematical models were able to fit the
data of Experiment-2, with model best-fits falling within
error bars for most of the measurements (Figure 3A
and 3B). Resulting parameter values are reported in the
Supplementary Table 1. Note that the growth and treatment
parameters were kept the same among the groups and
only the scheduling of the drugs was changed. The fit of
the simple model (1) allowed to quantitatively estimate
improvement of vasculature quality due to bevacizumab

improvement were observed in the BEVA/TXL schedule
(Figure 3D). The first peak corresponds to the action of
the bevacizumab alone on the reduction of U. The second
and larger peak occurred approximately at the time of the
cytotoxic injection. It can be explained as follows: the
important decrease in V after the cytotoxics administration
induced a loss in the stimulation term of the equation on
U. The decrease was more pronounced in the stimulation
term than in the inhibition term due to the 2/3 power in
the latter. This translated into an important drop in U and
therefore an increase of Q (Supplementary Figure 4 and
Figure 3D). Eventually, we could generate a posteriori
data-informed estimates of the best time window for
the post-bevacizumab administration of paclitaxel

(Figure 4). This gave a value of 2.2 days as the optimal
gap between administrations of the two drugs, yielding
a 68.3% tumor size reduction at day 52 when compared
to the concomitant schedule, representing an additional
16.5 points in size reduction. Interestingly, the model
also predicted that some sequential schedules could be
detrimental and provoke an increase when compared with
the concomitant schedule, such as an 8 days gap (+13.6%).

DISCUSSION
Attempts to determine a better way to use
bevacizumab are probably as old as the drug itself [26] and
several non-clinical models have suggested that although

In silico simulations first suggested a 3.4 days lag-time
when administrating bevacizumab and paclitaxel. For
practical reasons, a sharp 3-days sequence was tested
experimentally, and bevacizumab was administered I.P.
because previous reports have demonstrated that drug
distribution and antitumor efficacy after I.P. injection were
equivalent to that of I.V. route [32]. In Experiment-1, both
the BEVA-TXL and the BEVA/TXL groups displayed
significantly reduced tumor growth as compared with all
other treatment groups. However, despite a trend towards
reduced tumor growth at treatment conclusion (–12%)
and study conclusion (–9%), no statistical difference
was found in efficacy or survival with the BEVA/TXL
sequence over concomitant administration, much probably
because of the sub-optimal dosing of bevacizumab in this
first experiment (i.e., 10 mg/kg). Of note, the reversed
sequence TXL/BEVA showed limited efficacy because no
statistical difference was found with Control at treatment
conclusion, thus demonstrating that in addition to merely
sequencing the dosing, the order of administration does
matter indeed. Monitoring metastatic spreading showed
marked differences among the groups with sometimes
contradictory trends depending on the localization (Figure
2C–2E). Of note, BEVA monotherapy seemed to increase
the appearance of both lymph node and lung metastasis,
and to a lesser extent of peritoneal carcinosis. This
observation that antiangiogenics used alone could trigger
early metastatic processes has already been reported with
sunitinib in a renal carcinoma mice model [33]. However,
this is the first time that it is reported with bevacizumab,
and this observation is in line with the significant shorter
median survival (60 days) observed with the BEVA
group. Based on this first set of data, Experiment-2 was
performed with slight changes to achieve a better efficacy
with the BEVA/TXL sequence over the BEVA-TXL
concomitant group. Bevacizumab dosing was doubled to
20 mg/kg, and interval between two cycles was extended
to 10 days. With this new setting, Experiment-2 showed

empirical, alternate scheduling would perform better than
standard concomitant dosing [4, 5, 8, 11, 26]. Recently,
clinical data have shown that bevacizumab combined with
carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel doublet yielded higher survival
in patients with improved vascularization, probably
through increased drug delivery of the nanoparticles [27].
Defining better sequencing between bevacizumab and
cytotoxics can be done experimentally, i.e. by monitoring
changes in vascular density, hypoxia or tumor blood flow
to determine next when the cytotoxics should be given, or
in a merely empirical fashion, by testing and comparing
different sequences in a trial-and-error mode. In this
context, computational approaches could help, through in
silico modeling, to determine rapidly the best scheduling
among countless possibilities. For robustness purposes,
and since our data was composed of macroscopic tumor
growth kinetics, our mathematical model was deliberately
kept to a minimal number of parameters and specifically
designed for capturing normalization dynamics following
the administration of bevacizumab. Both cytotoxic and
anti-angiogenic properties of paclitaxel were integrated
in our model (27). However, for the sake of practical
usability and identifiability of the model, we skipped
the thorough mechanistic description of the process
as proposed by other models [15–18], or more detailed
modeling of the anti-VEGF effect of bevacizumab [28,
29] or paclitaxel tumor penetration [30]. Despite this,
considerable standard errors remained in the estimation
of the parameters, in part due to the large uncertainty in
the measurement themselves, which is intrinsic to the
measurement technique (kinetics of luciferin distribution
in heterogeneous tumor mass). This generic model was
customized to simulate a variety of sequences between
bevacizumab and paclitaxel. We chose this doublet
because it is the first-line treatment for HER2-negative
breast cancer extensively used in the clinics for a decade
now [31]. Similarly, MDA-MB-231 was chosen as a
canonical xenograft model for refractory breast cancer.

that the BEVA/TXL sequence was more efficient with a
statistically significant reduction of 48% and 53% of tumor
growth as compared with concomitant dosing at the end of
the treatment period and at study conclusion, respectively.
Similarly, the BEVA/TXL sequence led to fewer and
slightly delayed metastatic lesions, thus confirming the
model predictions that delayed administration of paclitaxel
achieves better antiproliferative efficacy. Based on the
collected data, new model simulations suggested eventually
that a 2.2 days delay (i.e., about 53 hours) should be used to
administrate paclitaxel. Our model could easily be adapted
to other drugs by changing the PK component adequately,
which could lead to different optimal windows in other
settings. Previous attempts to model combination therapies
between antiangiogenics and cytotoxics had first been
merely theoretical, i.e. with no quantitative comparison to
experimental data [15, 18, 34], apart from two recent studies
[20, 21]. Here, our mathematical model was able to fully
reproduce experimental data generated in xenografted mice,
thus illustrating its robustness and the fact that although not
mechanistic, it could mimic the different pharmacodynamic
effects of the combination, depending on dosing and
scheduling. As such, this model could be used in a
prospective way to refine bevacizumab-based combinational
regimen, rather than trying to find an optimal sequence in
an empirical fashion. Integrating modeling support is now
a rising trend not only in basic research, but as well now in
experimental and clinical oncology. To date, most resources
in computational oncology have focused on developing
highly sophisticated mechanistic models to better understand
tumor biology. In addition to useful but complex multi-scale
approaches, developing simplified PK/PD models with
tumor biology kept at its minimal expression to generate
configurable parameters is another appealing strategy [14].
Such simplified phenomenological modeling has already
proved to be capable of mimicking complicated phenomena
[35] and its ability to be implemented at bedside [36–38].
Here, this proof-of-concept study strongly suggests that
simplified modeling could help to address the issue of finding
the optimal dosing and scheduling with bevacizumab.

To model the combined action of antiangiogenics
and cytotoxics on tumor growth, we departed from the
Hahnfeldt model that is able to take into account the effect
of vasculature-targeting agents [19]. This model combines
Gompertz growth for the tumor volume V(t) (with t
denoting the time) with a dynamic carrying capacity K(t)
(instead of a constant K in the classic Gompertz model).
The dynamics of K(t) is governed by a balance between
endogenous stimulation and inhibition of angiogenesis,
with terms derived from biophysical considerations about
diffusion rates of stimulatory/inhibitory agents. The effect
of the cytotoxic drug (paclitaxel) was modeled similarly as
in [41] where the authors considered a delay in the effect the
drug, due to the fact that the cells are not directly removed
after cytotoxic administration because they only die when
reaching a specific step of the cell cycle. After being affected
by paclitaxel, the tumor cells thus stop proliferating and
go through three compartments Z1, Z2 and Z3 before being
removed from the system. Following reported observations,
we considered that paclitaxel also had an anti-angiogenic
effect [42]. Based on the literature [43], vascular endothelial
cells were estimated to be approximately 5 times more
sensitive to paclitaxel than tumor cells. The drugs delivery
was assumed to be modulated by the vascular capacity,
represented in the model by the variable K(t). Concentrations
of the cytotoxic and antiangiogenic drugs (respectively
denoted C(t) and A(t)) were given by their respective
pharmacokinetics models and parameters. To quantify the
effect of vascular normalization following bevacizumab
therapy as the key element of this work, we introduced a
new variable, the quality of the vasculature, denoted by
Q. We first considered a model where Q is constant in
time and depends on the scheduling. The model writes:

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Pharmacokinetics (PK) modeling
Plasma concentration of paclitaxel was described by
a two-phase profile (absorption and elimination) and was
characterized by a relatively fast elimination rate (terminal
half-life of 3 hours) [39]. PK parameters of plasma distribution
and elimination after intra-peritoneal administration were
taken from [39]. The PK of bevacizumab was characterized
by a one compartment model with absorption compartment
[40]. Supplementary Figure 5 depicts the concentration
profiles of the sequential and concomitant administrations for
the second experiment and the PK equations. PK parameters
are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

where V, K and Zi, i = 1,…,3 were expressed in
normalized units by the initial bioluminescence signal
corresponding to the number of injected cells. Thus, N
represents the fold increase of the total number of cells to
their initial value. Initial conditions at the first observation
time tI was thus taken to 1 for V. For K, it was determined
from a preliminary fit to the control data only. Critically, in
this first model, the expression of Q was given by:

we minimized the following objective function:

where Q is a constant parameter to be estimated
and BEVA-TXL and BEVA/TXL were respectively the
concomitant and adjuvant paclitaxel groups.
The previous approach, although able to quantify
the effect of vascular normalization on the drugs delivery
improvement by means of Q, is not suited for modeling
the dynamical changes of the vasculature quality, which
are responsible for the optimal therapeutic window in the
adjuvant administration of paclitaxel. Therefore, in line
with previous theoretical modeling investigations [22],
we enriched the model by means of a dynamic Q, linked
to the tumor-vasculature system in a semi-mechanistic
manner. Following biological rationales [8] and previous
theoretical work [18], the principle was to divide the
vasculature K(t) into two compartments: a stable one
S(t) (mature vessels) and an unstable one U(t) (immature
vessels), see Figure 5. The anti-angiogenic action of the
drugs was assumed to occur on U (rather than S), because
it represents the component of the vasculature directly
affected by neo-angiogenesis, and especially by VEGF
stimulation, which is the target of bevacizumab. Then, the
(macroscopic) quality of the vasculature was defined as
the ratio of the stable component of the vasculature over
the total amount of blood vessels. The equations write:

where g stands for the group (scheduling) index
ranging from l to G, i stands for the time point index
ranging from l to I, yig is the data point of group g at time
ti (mean over all the animals in the group). Due to the stiff
PK profiles (Supplementary Figure 5), simulations were
performed using the stiff ordinary differential equation
solver ode15s of Matlab, with a relative tolerance of 10-9
to avoid numerical issues. Preliminary fit investigations
constantly estimated τ to a negligible value (< 10-10),
consistently with the observations where no size decrease
was obtained. Therefore, we fixed its value to zero but
nevertheless kept it in the model as it could have nonzero
value in other situations. Values of the parameters resulting
from the fits are reported in Supplementary Table 1.

Animal experiments
All experiments were submitted and approved by
the local ethical committee of the institution (#CE14, Aix
Marseille Univ) and the French Ministère de L’Education
Nationale, de l ’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche
(MENESR) prior to starting the experiments. Experiments
were conducted in compliance with European regulations,
based on the UKCCCR guidelines for the welfare of
animals in experimental oncology [45]. Pathogen-free,
immuno-compromised 6-week-old female Nod Scid γ
(NSG) mice (Charles River Laboratories, France) were
kept in a sterile environment for 2 weeks upon reception.
Mice were maintained in sterilized filter-stopped cages
kept in a sterile and thermostated cabinet throughout

Parameters estimation
The parameters were taken the same for all the
groups, the only difference being the scheduling of the
therapy, and were estimated in two steps. In the first step,
manual exploration of the parameter space was conducted
in order to obtain visually acceptable fit between the
data and the model simulation. In a second step, an
optimization algorithm based on the fminsearch function
of Matlab (version R2015a, Mathworks Inc, NelderMead algorithm) was employed, following previously
reported methods [44]. Data from all the groups were
pooled together and the total sum of squared residuals was

the experiments. They were daily monitored for signs of
distress, decreased physical activity or any behavioral
change. Water was supplemented with paracetamol (eq.
80 mg/kg/day) to prevent metastatic disease-related pain
[46]. Animals were euthanized under anesthesia when
showing signs of distress, cachexia (i.e., loss of 10% of
body weight), or when tumor growth reached an apparent
mass of 2 g (i.e., 2 cm3). Bodyweights were monitored
twice a week as a surrogate marker for toxicity.

Monitoring for both primary tumor growth and
metastatic spreading started one week after engraftment.
Intra-peritoneal injection of firefly D-Luciferin (Perkin
Elmer, 150 mg/kg) was performed in mice before
starting imaging. Acquisitions started 12 minutes after
Luciferine injection, the delay required to reach a plateau
in bioluminescence signaling as shown in a previous
study using the same mammary fat pad model [47]. For
3D bioluminescence and search for metastatic lesions,
images were acquired at six different wavelengths (560
nm-660 nm) to discriminate signals depending on their
depth. Acquisition and data processing were performed
using IVIS Spectrum imager equipped with the Living
Image 4.2 software (PerkinElmer). For Experiment-2,
accuracy of the 3D imaging was compared with results
from necroscopic examination at study conclusion.

Xenograft
MDA-MB-231 cells were trypsinized, counted,
centrifuged (5 minutes, 1000 g) and washed twice with
sterile PBS. Cells were re-suspended in RPMI-1640 with
60% of Matrigel (BD Sciences France) and maintained in
ice-cooled conditions until engraftment. A volume of 50 μL
containing 80 000 cells (Experiment-1) and 120 000 cells
(Experiment-2) was injected in the mammary inguinal
right fat pad through the nipple under gas anesthesia (2%
sevofluran, (Abbott France)). A total of 84 tumor-bearing
mice were required to perform the experiments. However,
90 mice were initially xenografted, to ensure that 48
(Experiment-1) + 36 mice (Experiment-2) presenting with
positive and measurable tumors could be used, taking into
account an estimated 5% of possible failure during the
grafting procedure.

Treatments
In Experiment-1, 48 xenografted mice were divided
into 6 treatment groups (n = 8 mice per group): control
(saline injection), bevacizumab (BEVA), paclitaxel (TXL),
bevacizumab + paclitaxel given concomitantly (BEVATXL), bevacizumab followed by paclitaxel 3 days later
(BEVA/TXL), paclitaxel followed by bevacizumab

3 days later (TXL/BEVA). Treatments started 5 days after
xenografting (D5). Dosing for bevacizumab and paclitaxel
was 10 and 20 mg/kg respectively. A total of 3 cycles
administered on a weekly basis were performed (i.e., D5,
D12, D19). Based upon data collected from Experiment-1,
a second set of experiment was performed, with slights
changes in dosing, in sample size and inter-cure interval to
increase statistical power and to maximize the differences
between the groups. In Experiment-2, 36 xenografted
mice were divided into 3 groups (n = 12 mice per
group): control (saline), bevacizumab + paclitaxel given
concomitantly (BEVA-TXL) and bevacizumab followed
by paclitaxel 3 days later (BEVA/TXL). Treatment
started 11 days after xenografting (D11). Dosing for
bevacizumab and paclitaxel were 20 mg/kg for both
drugs. A total of 3 cycles administered every 10 days was
performed in Experiment-2 (i.e., D11, D21, D31). See the
Supplementary Figure 6 for a summary of the schedules.
All treatments were administered by intra-peritoneal route.

Inter-group differences in tumor growth were
tested by One-Way Anova with Tukey’s HSD Post Hoc
multiple comparison testing or Anova on Ranks with
Dunn’s method according to data distribution, using
Sigma Stat 4.0. software (Systat Software, Germany).
We calculated a new metastatic index defined for each
group and each location as the area under the cumulative
incidence divided by the duration of the experiment,
thus taking into account the dynamics of the metastatic
spreading (the higher the index, the more aggressive the
metastatic disease). Inter-group differences in survival
were analyzed by log-rank testing (R software 3.2.2, R
Core Team 2013, Vienna, Austria). Standard errors on the
parameters estimates were computed using previously
reported methods [44, 48].

CONCLUSIONS

7.	

In this pilot study, we have developed a simple
phenomenological model that can be used to simulate
the efficacy of different sequences between bevacizumab
and paclitaxel, so as to determine the optimal scheduling
between the drugs. This model has been voluntarily kept
to a maximal simplicity so as to ensure its applicability.
Although preliminary and performed on a single model,
two separate mathematically-driven studies in tumorbearing mice showed that experimental data matched
model predictions, thus confirming that delaying the
administration of paclitaxel after that of bevacizumab
improves the efficacy of this regimen. Beyond the
present issue of refining bevacizumab/paclitaxel dosing
and scheduling, our model could be further customized
to mimic the PK/PD relationships of antiangiogenics
associated with another chemotherapeutic regimen.
