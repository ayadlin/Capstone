ABSTRACT
Highly tumorigenic stem-like cells, considered tumor-initiating cells (TICs), are
the main cause of lung cancer initiation, relapse, and drug resistance. In this study,
we identified that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIγ (CaMKIIγ) was
aberrantly expressed in highly tumorigenic stem-like lung cancer cells, and was also
correlated with poor prognosis in human lung cancer. Functionally, CaMKIIγ enhanced
stem-like traits and the tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells in an Akt- and β-catenindependent manner. In addition, we found that CaMKIIγ upregulated Oct4 expression
via Akt-mediated histone acetylation. Taken together, our findings reveal a critical
role of CaMKIIγ in regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells
and offer a promising therapeutic target for TICs.

INTRODUCTION

For example, ectopic expression of Oct4, Nanog, or
c-Myc in lung cancer cells significantly increased the
CD133-expressing subpopulation, oncosphere formation,
tumorigenicity, and drug resistance, while knockdown
produced the opposite effect, supporting the notion that
iPSC factors play an essential role in high tumorigenicity
and stem-like traits [7-9]. In diverse human epithelial
cancers, iPSC factors are aberrantly activated or
expressed, and accompany high malignancy and poor
prognosis [10, 11]. However, the regulatory mechanism
of abnormal activation and expression of iPSC factors in
cancers is still unclear.
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is
a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase, consisting of
four homologous (CaMKIIα/β/γ/δ). Our previous papers
identified CaMKIIγ as a critical regulator of cell growth
and survival in leukemia, lung cancer, and liver cancer
[12-14]. In our recent study, CaMKIIγ was preferentially
expressed in TICs and associated with the β-catenin,
Stat3, and NF-κB signal pathways [12, 14]. However, the
precise function and molecular mechanism of CaMKIIγ in
stemness and tumorigenesis is unknown.
These exciting findings prompted us to
investigate whether CaMKIIγ is necessary for stem-

Phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer cells as a
consequence of genetic change and environmental
differences leads to formation of a tumor ecosystem
composed of various cell populations that have different
functions, like tumorigenesis, metastasis, relapse, and drug
resistance [1]. In the tumor ecosystem, highly tumorigenic
stem-like cells, considered tumor-initiating cells (TICs) or
cancer stem cells (CSCs), perform a vital role in tumor
initiation and development [2]. Such a population is
also responsible for tumor relapse after treatment. One
notable example is lung cancer, the leading annual cause
of cancer-related mortality worldwide [3]. Due to the
success of therapy targeted to driver genes, many patients
with lung cancer have a good initial response to therapy;
however, most experience a relapse within one year [4, 5].
Thus, specifically targeting the highly tumorigenic stemlike cell population has recently been suggested as a new
approach to treat lung cancer.
Transcription factors that are involved in cellular
reprogramming leading to generation of embryonic
stem-cell-like induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [6]
have been shown to be associated with TIC properties.

like and tumorigenic traits in cancers. The current study
demonstrated that CaMKIIγ was essential for maintaining
stem-like properties and the tumorigenicity of lung cancer
cells. We found that CaMKIIγ was highly activated
and expressed in highly tumorigenic and stem-like
cells enriched from culture conditioned for lung cancer
oncospheres. In vitro and in vivo assays indicated that
CaMKIIγ was required for stem-like and tumorigenic
characteristics of lung cancer cells. Next, we observed
that CaMKIIγ enhanced stem-like traits, including the
expression of iPSC factors and formation of oncospheres,
in an Akt- and β-catenin-dependent manner. Surprisingly,
our results revealed that CaMKIIγ regulated Akt-mediated
histone acetylation of iPSC factor Oct4 to improve its
expression. These observations highlight the importance
of CaMKIIγ in regulating the stemness and tumorigenesis
of lung cancer cells, illustrate a novel epigenetic regulation
of Oct4, and offer a new approach to target TICs in lung
cancer.

Lung cancer oncospheres display stem-like and
highly tumorigenic characteristics
Previous studies have shown that highly tumorigenic
stem-like cells, also called TICs, can be enriched in
serum-free medium with low adherence [15]. This
conditional culture induces highly tumorigenic cells
to form oncospheres within one or two weeks, while it
inhibits the growth of less tumorigenic cells. We harvested
oncospheres from three lung cancer cell lines (A549,
H1299, and HCC827) and one primary lung cancer sample
(ZRLC-1; Figure 1A). To evaluate the stem-like potential
of lung cancer oncospheres, we firstly detected the
fraction of stem-like surface-marker-positive populations,
like CD133+ or CD44+ cells, by flow cytometry. Stemlike markers varied in different lung cancer cell lines

and samples [2, 16, 17]. Our previous study indicated
that CD133 was the potential stem-like marker in A549,
H1299, and HCC827 cells, while CD44 was the marker in
ZRLC-1 cells. We observed that lung cancer oncospheres
contained higher percentages of CD133+ or CD44+ cells
than did parental cells (Figure 1B & S1A). Second, we
used real-time PCR to determine the mRNA expression
for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) factors, including
OCT4, MYC, KLF4, and NANOG, which were associated
with a stem-like phenotype. Results revealed that lung
cancer oncospheres showed enhanced expression of
these iPSC factors (Figure 1C). To identify the highly
tumorigenic potential of lung cancer oncospheres, we
subcutaneously implanted A549 oncosphere cells or
parental cells into NOD-SCID mice. As few as 2500
oncosphere cells were sufficient for tumor initiation in one
out of three hosts, whereas as many as 10000 parental cells
initiated one tumor in three hosts (Figure 1D & S1B). The
frequency of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) was calculated
by limiting dilution assay at approximately 1/2655 for
oncosphere cells and 1/32601 for parental cells (Figure
1E). Similar results were obtained in ZRLC-1 cells (Figure

S1C & D).

CaMKIIγ maintains stem-like and tumorigenic
traits of lung cancer cells
CaMKIIγ is required for the growth and survival
of non-small cell lung cancer cells and promotes colony
formation [14]. To assess the potential role of CaMKIIγ in
stem-like traits and tumorigenicity, we first tested mRNA
and protein expression in lung cancer oncospheres. A549
and H1299 oncospheres displayed a moderate increase in
activated and total CaMKIIγ expression compared with
parental cells, while HCC827, ZRLC-1, ZRLC-3 and
ZRLC-5 cells exhibited significantly enhanced expression
(Figure 2A & 2B). To evaluate whether CaMKIIγ was
increased in normal stem-like cells, we enriched sphere
cells from primary normal lung cells, ZRNL-4, ZRNL-18
and ZRNL-19, in serum-free medium with low adherence
and observed that CaMKIIγ was not highly expressed
or activated in normal lung sphere cells (Figure 2B). In
addition, CD133+/hi or CD44+/hi cells sorted from four

different lung cancer cells also showed higher activation
of CaMKIIγ than did CD133-/low or CD44-/low cells (Figure
2C & S2A). Then, we depleted CaMKIIγ in ZRLC1 and HCC827 cells for an in vitro assay of stem-like
potential and an in vivo assay of tumorigenicity. We found
that CaMKIIγ was necessary for oncosphere formation
in serum-free and low adherent culture (Figure 2D).
Additionally, CaMKIIγ knockdown sharply decreased
expression of two iPSC factors, Oct4 and c-Myc, at both
mRNA and protein levels (Figure 2E & 2F). Importantly,
tumorigenicity was also significantly inhibited upon
stable knockdown of CaMKIIγ in ZRLC-1 and HCC827
cells (Figure 2G & S2B). Based on the limiting dilution
assay, TICs frequency of CaMKIIγ-deleted cells was
1/75966 for ZRLC-1 (1/43259 for control cells) and
1/266829 for HCC827 (1/75966 for control cells; Figure
2H). Our results suggested that CaMKIIγ is required for
stem-like traits and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells.
To test whether ectopic expression of CaMKIIγ promotes
these properties, we overexpressed CaMKIIγ in A549
and H1299 cells. CaMKIIγ overexpression significantly
increased oncosphere formation in conditioned culture
(Figure 3B). Similarly, expression of two iPSC factors,
Oct4 and c-Myc, was enhanced and accompanied by
CaMKIIγ overexpression (Figure 3A). In the in vivo assay,
we observed that CaMKIIγ promoted tumorigenicity
in A549 and H1299 cells (Figure 3C & S3A), and
upregulated TICs frequency (Figure 3D). Sequential
histological analysis also demonstrated that positively
stained cells of Oct4 and c-Myc were significantly
accumulated in CaMKIIγ-overexpressed xenograft tumors,
compared with control tumors (Figure 3E).

support that KN93 impairs stem-like properties, including
the expression of iPSC factors and oncosphere formation,
and the transient inhibition of CaMKIIγ also irreversibly
reduces tumorigenic potential.

CaMKIIγ is correlated with the expression of
iPSC factors and prognosis in human lung cancer
To assess the relevance of CaMKIIγ and iPSC
factors in human lung cancer, we examined the mRNA
expression of CaMKIIγ and iPSC factors in eleven lung
cancer cell lines and twelve lung cancer samples. In cancer
cell lines, CaMKIIγ was positively correlated with OCT4
and NANOG expression, but was not correlated with MYC
or KLF4 (Figure 5A). In cancer samples, CaMKIIγ was
positively correlated with OCT4 and MYC (Figure 5B).
To further examine the relationship between CaMKIIγ
and two iPSC factors, we downloaded the expression data
of CaMKIIγ, OCT4, and MYC in lung cancer from the
Oncomine® microarray database for Pearson correlation
analysis. Our results revealed that CaMKIIγ was positively
correlated with MYC expression in most studies, and
CaMKIIγ was positively correlated with OCT4 in some
studies (Figure 5C & S5A). Furthermore, we obtained
the clinical data and CaMKIIγ expression of lung cancer
from Oncomine®. Results indicated that patients with high
pathological grade or high clinical stage showed higher
expression of CaMKIIγ than ones with low grade or low
stage (Figure 5D & S5B). Besides, CaMKIIγ expression
had no correlation with cancer type, like adenocarcinoma,
squamous cell carcinoma or large cell carcinoma (Figure
S5C). Surprisingly, in three groups of Oncomine® data,
we observed that patients with high CaMKIIγ expression
displayed a significant poor prognosis (Figure 5E).

CaMKIIγ inhibitor impairs stem-like properties
and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells

CaMKIIγ enhances stem-like traits in an Akt- and
β-catenin-dependent manner

To investigate whether KN93, an effective inhibitor
of CaMKII kinase activity, impairs stem-like and
tumorigenic properties, we treated lung cancer cells with
KN93 or KN92 (a structural analog with no corresponding
inhibitory effect) for in vitro and in vivo assays. In ZRLC1 and HCC827 cells, treatment with KN93 at 10 μM (IC50)
yielded a significant decrease in the mRNA and protein
expression of iPSC factors, especially Oct4 and c-Myc
(Figure 4A & 4B). Surprisingly, 10 μM KN93 completely
inhibited oncosphere formation in both cell lines. A
subsequent assay showed that 5 μM (half IC50) KN93 still
had an inhibitory effect on oncosphere formation (Figure
4C). To determine whether KN93-mediated impairment
of tumorigenic potential was transient or irreversible, we
exposed ZRLC-1 and HCC827 cells to KN93 for four
days, removed the inhibitor, and subcutaneously injected
the cells into nude mice. Tumorigenicity was significantly
reduced following KN93 treatment, compared with KN92
treatment (Figure 4D & S4A). Therefore, our results

The Akt-Oct4 circuit and Wnt-β-catenin-c-Myc
pathway have been implicated as important regulators
of stemness [18, 19]. The above results prompted us
to investigate the role of Akt and β-catenin signals
in the enhancement of stem-like traits, mediated by
CaMKIIγ. We observed that Akt and β-catenin signals
were activated in H1299 oncospheres (Figure 6A).
Furthermore, overexpression of CaMKIIγ activated Akt
and β-catenin signals in H1299 cells (Figure 6B), while
CaMKIIγ inhibitor reduced the activation in ZRLC1 cells (Figure 6C). To determine whether CaMKIIγactivated Akt and β-catenin signals were involved in the
regulation of Oct4 and c-Myc expression, we treated
CaMKIIγ-overexpressed cells with inhibitors of Akt and
β-catenin signals. We found that CaMKIIγ-overexpressed
cells displayed a significant decrease in Oct4 and c-Myc
expression following treatment with Akt and β-catenin

inhibitors (Figure 6D). Our results indicated that both
Akt and β-catenin signals are involved in the regulation
of Oct4 and c-Myc expression, and there may be crosstalk
between the Akt and β-catenin pathways. We also used
co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) to examine whether
CaMKIIγ interacted with Akt, and to test our Scansite
prediction that CaMKIIγ could phosphorylate Akt at the
Ser473 site. We discovered that CaMKIIγ interacted with
Akt in lung cancer cells (Figure 6E). In our previous study,
we also showed that CaMKIIγ interacted with β-catenin
[12]. These data suggested that Akt and β-catenin
might be substrates of CaMKIIγ kinase. To test whether
CaMKIIγ-regulated Akt and β-catenin signals participated
in oncosphere formation, we exposed CaMKIIγoverexpressed cells to Akt and β-catenin inhibitors for
an in vitro assay. The data showed that Akt and β-catenin
inhibitors antagonized the enhancement of oncosphere

formation mediated by CaMKIIγ in both A549 and H1299
cells (Figure 6G). To investigate the relationship between
CaMKIIγ and other pathways involved in stemness, like
Notch, or Hedgehog pathway, we used dual luciferase
reporter assay to detect the effect of CaMKIIγ on these
pathways and found that CaMKIIγ overexpression
promoted the expression of TOP and RBP-JK reporter
which represented Wnt and Notch pathway, while it had
no influence on GLI reporter for Hedgehog pathway
(Figure 6E & S6B).

enhance histone acetylation to improve transcription of
OCT4 and MYC. First, we tested common modifications
of histone in CaMKIIγ-overexpressed or -inhibited cells,
and observed that histone was dominantly acetylated
or de-acetylated when CaMKIIγ was overexpressed or
inhibited (Figure 7A & 7B). Second, to identify whether
de-acetylation mediated by KN93 could be secured by
histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA, we treated ZRLC-1
cells with KN93 or KN93+TSA, and then tested Oct4 and
c-Myc expression using western blots. Surprisingly, Oct4
expression reduced by KN93 was rescued following TSA
treatment, while TSA had no effect on c-Myc expression
(Figure 7C). Third, to further examine whether Akt was
involved in CaMKIIγ-triggered histone acetylation, we
exposed CaMKIIγ-overexpressed cells to Akt inhibitor
and found that CaMKIIγ-elevated histone acetylation was
antagonized by Akt in H1299 cells (Figure 7D). Fourth, to
demonstrate that CaMKIIγ-regulated Oct4 expression was
associated with histone acetylation, we used chromatin
immunoprecipitation (CHIP) technology to quantify
histone acetylation at the OCT4 gene in control cells,

CaMKIIγ-overexpressed cells, or CaMKIIγ-overexpressed
cells treated with Akt. Histone was significantly
acetylated in CaMKIIγ-overexpressed cells; acetylation
decreased following Akt inhibitor treatment (Figure 7E).
Next, we detected common histone acetyltransferases
QCN5L2, PCAF, and CBP, and observed that PCAF was
dominantly expressed in CaMKIIγ-overexpressed cells
and oncosphere cells (Figure 7F & 7G). Finally, we used
CHIP-PCR to quantify the enrichment of PCAF at the
OCT4 gene. CaMKIIγ overexpression promoted PCAF
binding to OCT4, which was reduced by Akt inhibitor
(Figure 7H). Collectively, we concluded that CaMKIIγ
regulates histone acetylation to enhance Oct4 expression
through Akt, as shown in Figure 8.

DISCUSSION
The current study defines a critical role of CaMKIIγ
in the stemness and tumorigenesis of lung cancer
cells. Although CSCs and TICs have not previously
been identified in lung cancer, several studies of other

Figure 8: Schematic model of epigenetic regulation of Oct4 expression. Schematic representation of how CaMKIIγ regulates

Oct4 expression in lung cancer cells. CaMKIIγ enhances Oct4 expression depending on the increase of histone acetylation, which is
mediated by acetylation transferases, especially for PCAF. Besides, Akt, activated by CaMKIIγ, is involved in this epigenetic regulation,
which can be suppressed by Akt inhibitor.

cancers have identified a small subpopulation of highly
tumorigenic and stem-like cells that are considered CSCs
or TICs. Such a subpopulation was significantly associated
with poor prognosis, drug resistance, and tumor relapse,
and is becoming a highlighted target for the treatment of
low-differentiated, drug-resistant, or recurrent lung cancer.
Glycine decarboxylase (GLDC), PKCι, Notch3,
and integrin β3-KRAS-RalB have been shown to play
important roles in the acquisition and maintenance of
stemness in lung cancer [2, 15, 16, 21]. Still, most targets
cannot be translated into clinical application, due to
similar expression or activation in normal stem cells. Here,
we identified CaMKIIγ as a potential target for stemness
and tumorigenesis.
Our previous study demonstrated that CaMKIIγ
was aberrantly activated and expressed in lung cancer
tissue, and that normal hematopoietic stem cells expressed
CaMKIIγ minimally or not at all [12, 14]. Furthermore, we
found that CaMKIIγ was preferentially expressed in highly
tumorigenic and stem-like cells, which were regarded
as CSCs or TICs, compared with parental cells. These
findings drove us to make a detailed study of the function
and regulatory mechanism of CaMKIIγ in stemness and
tumorigenesis.
Highly tumorigenic and stem-like cells are
commonly sorted or enriched by stem cell markers or
non-marker technology, like oncosphere formation or drug
resistance. Due to tumor heterogeneity, a standard set of
stem cell markers has not been identified for lung cancer.
CD166+, CD133+, CD44+, and CD24+ITGB4+NOTCHhi
cells have been labeled as CSCs or TICs in different
studies [2, 16], but few of these studies could be repeated
in lung cancer cell lines or samples. In addition, highly
tumorigenic and stem-like cells can be enriched following
serum-free and low adherent culture. After one or two
weeks of conditional culture, lung cancer oncospheres
formed and were collected for in vitro and in vivo assays.
In our study, we indicated that oncosphere cells displayed
stem-like traits, including higher expression of stem cell
markers and iPSC factors, and higher tumorigenicity
compared with parental cells. Importantly, our results
revealed that CaMKIIγ was highly activated and expressed
in lung cancer oncospheres, which were enriched from
lung cancer cell lines and primary lung cancer cells.
Next, we found that knockdown of CaMKIIγ in
lung cancer cells significantly reduced the expression of
iPSC factors (Oct4 and c-Myc), oncosphere formation,
and tumorigenicity. This suggested that CaMKIIγ was
necessary for maintaining stem-like and tumorigenic
properties. In contrast, ectopic expression of CaMKIIγ
enhanced these traits. Further, we treated lung cancer
cells with CaMKII inhibitor KN93, and observed that
expression of iPSC factors and ability of oncosphere
formation sharply decreased following KN93 treatment.
Moreover, inhibition of CaMKIIγ activity irreversibly
impaired tumorigenic potential. Thus, we concluded
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that CaMKIIγ maintains stem-like and tumorigenic
characteristics, depending on kinase activity and that iPSC
factors, especially Oct4 and c-Myc, may be the important
effectors regulated by CaMKIIγ.
The Akt-Oct4 circuit and Wnt-β-catenin-c-Myc
pathway have been implicated as important regulators of
stemness. In the present study, we discovered that Akt and
β-catenin signals were indeed involved in the enhancement
of Oct4 and c-Myc expression and oncosphere formation
mediated by CaMKIIγ. Additionally, Akt and β-catenin
signals may have a crosstalk on regulation of Oct4 and
c-Myc expression. In our previous study, we demonstrated
that CaMKIIγ interacts with β-catenin and promotes its
nuclear location. Here, we also certified that CaMKIIγ
interacted with Akt and used Scansite, an online tool,
to predict that CaMKIIγ could phosphorylate Akt at the
Ser 473 site (http://scansite.mit.edu). Therefore, we draw
a conclusion that CaMKIIγ enhances stem-like traits,
consisting of Oct4 and c-Myc expression and oncosphere
formation, in an Akt- and β-catenin-dependent manner.
Emerging
evidence
indicates
that
Akt
phosphorylates Oct4 at threonine 235 and facilitates
its nuclear localization. In the present study, we
investigated how Akt functioned with Oct4, except for
direct activation, and whether Akt could regulate Oct4
expression. A recent paper indicated that Akt stimulated
histone acetylation by increasing acetyl coenzyme
A (acetyl-CoA) availability [20]. We speculated that
CaMKIIγ-induced Akt activation could enhance histone
acetylation, to improve the transcription of OCT4. We
found that CaMKIIγ overexpression increased the histone
acetylation level at the OCT4 gene, while treatment with
Akt inhibitor decreased this OCT4 modification. KN93,
a CaMKII inhibitor, diminished acetylated histone,
which was restored by the histone deacetylase inhibitor,
TSA. Collectively, our data suggested that CaMKIIγ
orchestrated the epigenetic regulation of Oct4 expression,
depending on Akt signal.
Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog pathways have been
reported as important pathways in the stemness of lung
cancer [22, 23]. CaMKII is described as a mediator of noncanonical Wnt pathway [24]. Here, we investigated the
crosstalk between CaMKIIγ signaling and canonical Wnt
pathway. Results indicated that CaMKIIγ-Akt signaling
regulates canonical Wnt pathway, while the precise
mechanism needs further studies. Besides, depending
on the dual luciferase reporter assay, we concluded that
CaMKIIγ signaling activated Notch pathway, while it
had no influence on Hedgehog pathway. The mechanism
how CaMKIIγ regulates Notch pathway, needs further
study. Meanwhile, we also demonstrated that CaMKIIγAkt epigenetically enhanced Oct4 expression via histone
acetylation.
Finally, we determined whether there was a
correlation between CaMKIIγ, Oct4, and human lung
cancer prognosis. CaMKIIγ was positively correlated with

Ethics statement

Oct4 and c-Myc in lung cancer samples, and patients with
higher expression of CaMKIIγ had significantly worse
prognosis. In general, the clinical observations were in
accordance with the above results. Based on our findings
that CaMKIIγ maintains stem-like and tumorigenic
properties, depending on Akt and β-catenin, that CaMKIIγ
regulates Akt-mediated histone acetylation of Oct4, and
that CaMKIIγ is positively correlated with Oct4 and
poor prognosis, we propose that CaMKIIγ is a potential
biomarker for highly tumorigenic and stem-like cells.

Lung cancer samples were obtained from the
Department of Pathology, with patient written informed
consent. The Hospital’s ethics committee approved
all experiments. General information of 12 patients
was listed as follows. Stage: IA 4, IB 2, IIA 2, IIB 4,

Limiting dilution analysis
For the tumorigenicity of oncosphere cells, fourweek-old NOD-SCID mice were used with the approval
of animal ethics committee. Parental lung cancer cells
or oncosphere cells were diluted serially to the desired
cell doses (2.5×103, 5.0×103, 1.0×104, 1.0×105) and then
separately subcutaneously injected in the left and right
flanks of NOD-SCID mice. For the other xenograft
tumor experiments, four-week-old nude mice (BALB/c
nude) were used. Control or treated lung cancer cells
(with CaMKIIγ overexpression, knockdown or inhibitor
treatment) were diluted serially to the desired cell
doses (from 1.0×103 to 1.0×106) and then separately
subcutaneously injected in the left and right flank of nude
mice. The number of tumors formed out of the number
of sites injected was counted to determine the frequency
of TICs, which was calculated using the ELDA software
(http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/index.html).

Cell culture and oncosphere culture

Stable knockdown & overexpression
For stable knockdown, lung cancer cells were
transfected with control or CaMKIIγ shRNA using a
lentiviral system, which was constructed in our previous
study [14] and then cultured with puromycin (2.5 μg/
ml) for two weeks. Next, transduced cells were seeded in
96-well plates at a single cell per well dose, for colony
formation. The single colony wells were picked and
digested for further culture and detection of knockdown.
For stable overexpression, cells were transfected with
control or wild-type CaMKIIγ using a lentiviral system,
which was constructed in our previous study [14], and
then cultured with blasticidin (10 μg/ml) for two weeks.
