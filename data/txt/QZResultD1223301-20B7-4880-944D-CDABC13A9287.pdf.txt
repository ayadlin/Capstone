Abstract
RLIP76 is a multifunctional transporter protein that serves as
an energy-dependent efflux mechanism for endogenously generated toxic metabolites as well as exogenous toxins, including
chemotherapy drugs. Our recent studies in cultured cells,
syngeneic animal tumor model, and in xenograft model have
shown that RLIP76 serves a major cancer-specific antiapoptotic role in a wide variety of histologic types of cancer, including leukemia, melanoma, colon, lung, prostate, and ovarian
cancer. Results of present studies in cell culture and xenograft
model of Caki-2 cells show that RLIP76 is an important
anticancer for kidney cancer because inhibition of RLIP76
function by antibody or its depletion by small interfering RNA
or antisense DNA caused marked and sustained regression of
established human kidney xenografts of Caki-2 cells in nude
mouse. [Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4244–51]

Introduction
Almost 55,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with
kidney cancer each year, and early diagnosis and effective surgical
therapy are necessary for its cure. Surgical therapy frequently fails
in more advanced stages with involvement of renal vein, lymph
nodes, or invasion through the renal cortex (1–5). Highly drug/
radiation-resistant nature of kidney cancer compared with other
neoplasm is the major reason why there is still no effective and lifeprolonging traditional chemotherapy for kidney cancer. Introduction of multispecific kinase inhibitors sorafenib (BAY 43-9006;
Nexavar, Bayer) and sunitinib (SU011248; Sutent, Pfizer) to the
clinical arena has revolutionized the therapy of advanced kidney
cancer (6–12). It is likely that once the optimal drug dosage and
combinations are developed, these agents may have even more
substantial effect on survival in kidney cancer (10, 12). The most
recent approval of the drug temsirolimus (CCI-779; Torisel, Wyeth),
the first mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, offers an
alternative for patients failing the kinase inhibitors, although the
toxicity of this drug is greater (13–15). Torisel provides significantly
higher median overall survival and progression-free survival compared with IFN-a (15–17). Although prolonged remissions are
occasionally seen, the benefit offered by these agents is most often
short lived, and there is a clear need for development of more
effective therapies.
A potential approach for improving the therapeutic efficacy of
targeted therapy for kidney cancer could be to target the under-

lying mechanisms responsible for drug resistance or radiation resistance. Kidney cancer cells express high levels of multiple membrane transporters that can participate in drug resistance and may
also play some role in radiation resistance (18, 19). The majority
of these belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins. Clinically, however, inhibitors of ABC transporters have
not yet been successful in improving chemotherapeutic outcomes
(20, 21), indicating that other resistance mechanisms are involved
(22). Prominent among these other mechanisms are reduced
glutathione (GSH), glutathione synthetase, glutathione reductase,
glutathione S-transferases (GST), cytochrome P450s, g-glutamyl
transpeptidase, and the components of mercapturic acid pathway
including the transporters for GSH conjugates (GS-E).
RLIP76 (RALBP1 gene product) is a stress-responsive, multifunctional transporter protein for GS-E as well as several toxic
compounds, including chemotherapy drugs. It is frequently overexpressed in malignant cells and functions to oppose apoptosis by
limiting the accumulation of endogenous or exogenous toxic
electrophilic compounds in cells. RLIP76 was cloned originally as a
Ral-binding GTPase-activating protein through a yeast two-hybrid
screen (23). It is a 76-kDa protein, but it appears as a 95-kDa band
in SDS-PAGE (24). Tissue-purified as well as recombinant RLIP76
has been shown to function in isolated in vitro systems as well as
in vivo studies to be an ATP-dependent transporter of GS-E as
well as of the amphiphilic anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin
(Adriamycin), vincristine, vinblastine, and vinorelbine (24–28).
Studies showing the marked enhancement of vinorelbine efficacy
in lung cancer and colon cancer xenografts by concomitant depletion or inhibition of RLIP76 have confirmed the in vivo relevance of
these observations (29).
Recent studies have established that in human and rodent
tissues and cells, RLIP76 is a major GS-E transporter (24–28, 30–33).
Whereas several ABC transporters such as multidrug resistance
protein (MRP) 1, MRP3, MRP5, and BCRP do catalyze transport
of GS-E, individually, each transporter represents a fraction of the
total GS-E efflux capacity of cells (34, 35). In contrast, genetic
deletion of the non-ABC transporter RLIP76 (76-kDa splice variant
encoded by the human RALBP1 gene, functionally and structurally
homologous to corresponding splice variant in mouse and rat,
Ralbp1, which is encoded by the rodent Ralbp1 gene) causes loss of
about four fifths of total transport activity for GS-E. The loss
transport of GS-E in RLIP76 knockout mice results in accumulation
of GS-E and their electrophilic precursors (e.g., GS-HNE and 4HNE)
in the tissues of these animals (36), and GST activity is reversibly
inhibited due to accumulation of GS-E (37). These studies suggest that RLIP76 could be a very convenient single target that if
depleted or inhibited could cause global inhibition of the mercapturic acid pathway.
Complete and sustained regressions of human non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) and colon cancer xenografts by systemic
depletion or antibody-mediated inhibition clearly show the effectiveness of targeting the mercapturic acid pathway through RLIP76

RLIP76 and Kidney Cancer

(29). Syngeneic mouse B16 melanoma, a highly resistant malignancy, underwent a near complete regression (38); in addition, cell
culture studies have shown that inhibiting or depleting RLIP76
causes apoptosis in several histologic types of malignancy, including leukemia, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer. Significant expression of RLIP76 was previously shown in normal mouse kidney
tissues (25) but not directly in kidney cancer cells. Because preliminary studies in cultured kidney cancer cells confirmed high
expression of RLIP76, consistent with gene expression analyses, we
carried out the present studies to determine whether RLIP76
depletion can be used to target kidney cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. RPMI 1640 and DMEM, PBS, penicillin/streptomycin solution,
fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin-EDTA, and trypan blue were purchased
from Life Technologies, Inc. DMSO, G418 (geneticin), and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were obtained from
Sigma. Doxorubicin was obtained from Adria Laboratories. 14C-doxorubicin
(specific activity, 44.8 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Sciences.
Source of polyclonal rabbit anti-human rec-RLIP76 antibodies and protocol
for purification of IgG were the same as previously described (24). Terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
fluorescence detection kit was purchased from Promega. Dinitrophenyl
S-glutathione (DNP-SG) was synthesized from 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene
and GSH according to the method described by us previously (24). The
sources of other chemicals used in this study were the same as described
previously (24, 39).
Cell lines and cultures. Human kidney normal (mesangial) and cancer
(Caki-2) cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection. All cells were cultured at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated
FBS, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/L glucose, and 1.5 g/L
sodium bicarbonate.
Anti-RLIP76 antibodies. We have raised and purified polyclonal rabbit
anti-human RLIP76 IgG using procedures described previously (24) and
aliquots were stored at 86jC. All reagents for the preparation of
antibodies and storage were filtered through 0.22-Am filters and handled
under laminar flow hoods in a sterile manner. Aerobic, anaerobic, and
fungal cultures of random aliquots were performed at 2-mo intervals. The
integrity and purity of the antibodies were consistently checked by SDSPAGE and Western blot analysis against anti-IgG antibodies during these
studies. Protein A affinity-purified immunoglobulin fraction obtained from
the preimmune serum was used as control. Anti-RLIP76 IgG used in these
experiments was previously shown by Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion assay to be non–cross-reactive with any other proteins, including
P-glycoprotein or MRP1 (30, 40).
RLIP76 small interfering RNA preparation. RLIP76 small interfering
RNA (siRNA) was purchased from Dharmacon Research, as described
previously (41).
RLIP76 phosphorothioate antisense DNA preparation. RLIP76
antisense was purchased from Biosynthesis, Inc., as described previously
(38).
Drug sensitivity (MTT) assay. Cell number/mL in an aliquot of cells
growing in log phase was determined by counting trypan blue–excluding
cells in a hemocytometer, and 20,000 cells were plated into each well of 96well flat-bottomed microtiter plates. After 12 h of incubation at 37jC,
medium containing either preimmune IgG or anti-RLIP76 IgG was added to
cells. After 24 to 48 h of incubation, 20 AL of 5 mg/mL MTT were introduced
to each well and incubated for 2 h of exposure. The plates were centrifuged
and medium was decanted. Cells were subsequently dissolved in 100 AL
DMSO with gentle shaking for 2 h at room temperature followed by
measurement of absorbance at 570 nm (41). Eight replicate wells were
used at each point in each of three separate measurements. Measured
absorbance values were directly linked with a spreadsheet for calculation of

IC50, defined as the drug concentration that reduced formazan formation
by 50%. Depletion of RLIP76 expression in cells by RLIP76 siRNA and
RLIP76 antisense was measured as follows: cells were incubated for 3 h with
0 to 4 Ag/well of either RLIP76 siRNA or antisense in TransMessenger
Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) and Maxfect Transfection Reagent (Molecula,
Inc.), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s provided protocol.
Preparations of total crude membrane fractions for Western blot
analyses. Crude membrane fractions were prepared from the normal and
cancer cell lines using established procedures as described previously (38).
Levels of RLIP76 protein in normal and cancer cells were measured by
ELISA assay using anti-RLIP76 IgG as previously described (41). Purified recRLIP76 with purity assessed by amino acid composition analysis was used
to generate calibration curves.
Purification of RLIP76. DNP-SG affinity resin was prepared as
described previously (24). All buffers used for purification were prepared
fresh and filtered through sterilized 0.22-Am membrane. Affinity purification of RLIP76 from human kidney cells was carried out in a manner
identical to that described previously for human lung cancer cell lines (40).
Because polidocanol interfered with Bradford reagent, protein was
estimated by the method of Minamide and Bamburg (42). SDS-PAGE and
Western blot analyses were performed by the method as described
previously (24, 39).
Preparation of RLIP76 liposomes. rec-RLIP76 was purified by DNP-SG
affinity chromatography as previously described from transformed Escherichia
coli BL21 expressing the full-length (1,968 bp) RLIP76 cDNA in PET30a
(+) prokaryotic expression plasmid and purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE,
Western blot, amino acid composition analyses, and matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry. To prepare proteoliposomes,
purified RLIP76 was dialyzed against reconstitution buffer [10 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 4 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 100 mmol/L KCl,
40 mmol/L sucrose, 2.8 mmol/L h-mercaptoethanol, 0.05 mmol/L butylated
hydroxytoluene, 0.025% polidocanol]. An aqueous emulsion of soybean
asolectin (40 mg/mL) and cholesterol (10 mg/mL) was prepared in the
reconstitution buffer by sonication, from which a 100 AL aliquot was added to
0.9 mL of dialyzed purified RLIP76 protein. After sonication of the resulting
mixture for 30 s at 50 W, 200 mg of SM-2 Bio-beads preequilibrated with
reconstitution buffer (without polidocanol) were added to initiate vesiculation, and after 4 h of incubation at 4jC, SM-2 beads were removed by
centrifugation at 3,620  g and the vesicles (RLIP76 liposomes) were collected.
Control liposomes were prepared using an equal amount of crude protein
from E. coli not expressing RLIP76 (24).
Transport studies in artificial liposomes. Transport studies in
proteoliposomes were done by the same method as described previously
(24). No-protein proteoliposomes were used as negative controls.
Transport studies in inside-out vesicles. Inside-out vesicles (IOV) were
prepared from the human kidney cell lines as described by us for the K562
cells (24). Transport studies of doxorubicin and DNP-SG in IOV were
performed by the method as described previously (24). ATP-dependent
uptake of 14C-doxorubicin was determined by subtracting the radioactivity (cpm) of the control without ATP from that of the experimental containing ATP and the transport of doxorubicin was calculated in terms
of pmol/min/mg IOV protein. The transport of 3H-DNP-SG was measured
in a similar manner.
Animal model. Hsd: athymic nude nu/nu mice (f11 wk old) were
obtained from Harlan. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Thirty mice were divided into six groups of 5 animals (treated with
preimmune serum, scrambled siRNA, scrambled antisense DNA, RLIP76
antibodies, RLIP76 siRNA, and RLIP76 antisense). All 30 animals were injected
with 2  106 human kidney cancer cell (Caki-2) suspensions in 100 AL PBS
s.c. Animals were examined daily for signs of tumor growth. Treatment was
administered when the tumor surface area exceeded 42 mm2 (fday 22).
Treatment consisted of 200 Ag of either RLIP76 antibodies, siRNA, or
antisense in 100 AL PBS. Control groups were treated with 200 Ag/100 AL
of either preimmune serum, scrambled siRNA, or scrambled antisense DNA.
These animal studies are necessary for development of kidney cancer xenografts in nude mice. Tumors were measured in two dimensions by calipers

the software that automates this analysis.
Effect of RLIP76 antibody, siRNA, and antisense on apoptosis by
TUNEL assay. In these studies, we assessed whether cellular levels of
RLIP76 could be depleted by RLIP76 antibody–mediated, RLIP76 siRNA–
mediated, or RLIP76 antisense–mediated delivery to cultured kidney cancer
cells and assessed whether uptake is correlated with apoptosis by the
TUNEL assay. The Caki-2 kidney cancer cells (1  106) were grown on the
coverslips. The cells were treated with RLIP76 antibody (40 Ag/mL final
concentration) or transfected with either RLIP76 siRNA (20 Ag/mL final
concentration) or antisense (10 Ag/mL final concentration). After 24 h of
incubation, the medium was removed and cells were washed with PBS.
TUNEL assay was performed using Promega fluorescence detection kit
according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer and described by
us previously (39).
Annexin V apoptosis assays: effect of RLIP76 antibody, siRNA, and
antisense on apoptosis by FITC-labeled Annexin V conjugate assay.
Early apoptosis was measured by studying the loss of membrane asymmetry
using Annexin V staining analyzed by flow cytometry according to the
method of Hammill and colleagues (43). Briefly, Caki-2 cells (0.5  106/mL)
were grown in six-well plate and treated with preimmune serum, antiRLIP76 IgG, scrambled siRNA, RLIP76 siRNA, scrambled antisense,
and RLIP76 antisense ( final concentration: antibody, 40 Ag/mL; siRNA,
20 Ag/mL; and antisense, 10 Ag/mL). After 24 h of incubation, the cells were
harvested and centrifuged at 1,500  g for 5 min. Cells were washed once
with PBS and resuspended in 400 AL of cold Annexin binding buffer
containing 5 AL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 AL of 0.1 mg/mL propidium
iodide. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the dark
and analyzed by flow cytometry using a Beckman Coulter Cytomics FC500
flow cytometer. Results were processed using CXP2.2 analysis software from
Beckman Coulter (39).

Results and Discussion
Expression and transport function of RLIP76 in kidney cells.
Western blot analyses of membrane protein extracts from human
kidney normal (mesangial) and malignant (Caki-2) cells were
performed against anti-RLIP76 IgG, indicating relatively larger

amounts of RLIP76 in Caki-2 (f3-fold) versus mesangial cells
(Fig. 1A). The specificity of anti-RLIP76 IgG used for Western blot
analyses was evident from comparison of peptide bands seen in
Western blot analyses of crude protein fraction (Fig. 1) with those
seen in SDS-PAGE or Western blot analyses of the purified protein
(Fig. 1B and C, respectively). RLIP76 from human kidney normal
(mesangial) and cancer (Caki-2) cells was purified by an identical
protocol of GS-E affinity chromatography used by us previously to
purify rec-RLIP76 from transformed E. coli (24). In reduced
denaturing gels, purified RLIP76 from both mesangial and Caki-2
cells showed two bands corresponding to the M r values of 95 and
67 kDa (Fig. 1B) and both bands were recognized by anti-RLIP76
IgG in Western blot analyses (Fig. 1C). Previous studies in our
laboratory (24) and by other investigators (23) have shown that
although the estimated molecular weights of RLIP76 and its rat and
mouse orthologs (RalBP1 and RIP, respectively) are f76 kDa, these
proteins show bands at higher M r values (95 kDa) in SDS gels.
Lower molecular weight bands that arise from their proteolytic
fragmentation are also observed (23, 24, 40). Taken together, these
results indicated that GS-E affinity chromatography purification
yielded apparently homogenous RLIP76 from kidney cell lines.
The results of RLIP76 protein and transport activity are
presented in Table 1 and show that the amounts of total crude
membrane proteins obtained from 100  106 cells in log phase
growth were comparable for mesangial (7.73 F 0.52 mg) and Caki-2
(7.42 F 0.38 mg) cells. Although a relatively greater amount of
RLIP76 protein in Caki-2 (46 F 3 Ag) compared with mesangial
(17 F 2 Ag) cells. RLIP76 protein represented a 0.22% and 0.62%
of the total detergent-soluble protein from the membranes of
mesangial and Caki-2 cells, respectively. These values of percentage of total membrane protein are in the range of those seen in
both SCLC and NSCLC (0.53 F 0.04% in SCLC, n = 6, versus 0.57 F
0.07% in NSCLC, n = 6; ref. 38). We have shown that proteoliposomes reconstituted with RLIP76 mediate ATP-dependent transport of doxorubicin and other drugs (24, 44). To examine whether

Figure 1. RLIP76 levels in mesangial versus Caki-2 kidney carcinoma. A, aliquots of crude membrane fractions of cells, containing 200 Ag protein, were used for
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting against anti-RLIP76 IgG as primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody
and developed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol as chromogenic substrate. h-Actin was used as an internal control. DNP-SG-Sepharose affinity-purified RLIP76 from
mesangial (control) and Caki-2 (malignant) human kidney cells (5 Ag protein) was applied to SDS-PAGE (B) and subjected to Western blot analyses (C). Results were
quantified by scanning densitometry.

presented in Fig. 1B and C, respectively. For transport studies, IOVs prepared from 20  106 cells were enriched for IOVs by wheat germ agglutinin
affinity chromatography (24). Transport activity was calculated from measurements of uptake of 14C-doxorubicin (specific activity, 8.5  104 cpm/nmol)
and 3H-DNP-SG (specific activity, 3.6  103 cpm/nmol) into the IOVs (20 Ag/30 AL reaction mixture) in the presence or absence of 4 mmol/L ATP as
described (24). Each transport experiment was done in triplicates in three separate experiments (n = 9).

Figure 3. A, effect of RLIP76 antibody, siRNA, and antisense on apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Cells were grown on coverslips. For anti-RLIP76 IgG treatment,
cells were incubated with RLIP76 antibody (40 Ag/mL concentration) for 24 h; for siRNA treatment (20 Ag/mL final concentration), cells were transfected with
TransMessenger Transfection Reagent; and for antisense treatment (10 Ag/mL final concentration), cells were transfected with Maxfect Transfection Reagent before
TUNEL assay using Promega fluorescence detection kit and examined using Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning fluorescence microscope with filters 520 nm
and >620 nm. Photographs taken at identical exposure at 400 magnification are presented. Apoptotic cells showed green fluorescence. B, effect of RLIP76 antibody,
siRNA, and antisense on apoptosis and necrosis by flow cytometry. Caki-2 cells (0.5  106/mL) were grown in six-well plate and treated with preimmune serum,
anti-RLIP76 IgG, scrambled siRNA, RLIP76 siRNA, scrambled antisense, and RLIP76 antisense (final concentration: antibody, 40 Ag/mL; siRNA, 20 Ag/mL; antisense,
10 Ag/mL). After 24 h of incubation, the cells were harvested and centrifuged at 1,500  g for 5 min. Cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 400 AL
cold Annexin binding buffer containing 5 AL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 AL of 0.1 mg/mL propidium iodide. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the dark
and analyzed by flow cytometry using a Beckman Coulter Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer. Results were processed using CXP2.2 analysis software.

transport of 14C-doxorubicin and 3H-DNP-SG revealed greater transport of both substrates in Caki-2 cells containing greater amounts
of RLIP76 protein and a general correlation between RLIP76 protein level and transport activity (Table 1). Greater RLIP76 expression corresponded to greater transport activity.
RLIP76 inhibition or depletion caused cytotoxicity in
malignant cells. The cytotoxic effects of RLIP76 inhibition by
anti-human RLIP76 antibodies or the depletion of RLIP76 by using
either siRNA or antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide
(R508) was assessed by an established MTT cytotoxicity method
(41). Cells were treated with preimmune IgG, scrambled siRNA,
scrambled antisense, anti-RLIP76 IgG, RLIP76 siRNA, or RLIP76
antisense for 24 hours. The toxicity of all three targeting agents was
preferentially directed to the malignant cells compared with nonmalignant cells, an observation we have seen with other malignant
(lung, ovary, prostate, and breast) compared with nonmalignant
cell lines (29, 38). In contrast with the results seen with lung or
colon cancer previously (in which all three modalities gave similar
results), antisense was significantly more effective in killing kidney

cancer cells than the antibody (Fig. 2A), and this difference could
be related to factors in kidney cancers that reduce the effectiveness
of the antibody or perhaps due to a relatively greater role of some
intracellular function of RLIP76 in kidney cancers. Effect of RLIP76
antisense revealed almost complete depletion of RLIP76 protein in
Caki-2 cells after 24 hours at a concentration of 10 Ag/mL shown
by Western blot analyses (Fig. 2B). RLIP76 depletion by antisense
was also examined in Caki-2 cells by immunohistochemistry. As
shown in Fig. 2C, RLIP76 is immunohistochemically detectable in
Caki-2 cells treated with the scrambled antisense. This is in stark
contrast with RLIP76 antisense, which nearly completely depleted
RLIP76 (Fig. 2C) and caused extensive apoptosis (Fig. 3).
Apoptosis caused by inhibition or depletion of RLIP76. The
mechanism of cytotoxicity was assessed by determining apoptosis
through an immunohistochemical TUNEL assay (Fig. 3A) as well as
flow cytometry for Annexin V and propidium iodide (Fig. 3B). The
results of the TUNEL assay showed no detectable apoptosis in the
cells treated with preimmune IgG, scrambled siRNA, or scrambled
antisense. Apoptosis was, however, seen in Caki-2 cells treated with

anti-RLIP76 IgG, RLIP76 siRNA, or RLIP76 antisense. The Caki-2
cells were significantly more susceptible than mesangial cells to the
cytotoxicity of RLIP76 antibodies, siRNA, and antisense. We did not
see any apoptosis in mesangial cells by TUNEL (Fig. 3A). Because
TUNEL detects the last steps in apoptosis, we measured Annexin V
in cells counterstained with propidium iodide to examine for the
presence of cells at earlier stage of apoptosis; necrotic cells are
stained by propidium iodide. The Annexin V–positive fraction of
cells was unaffected either by preimmune serum or by scrambled
siRNA and scrambled antisense. The antisense approach caused
the most dramatic effect on apoptosis and necrosis at 24 hours
after exposure (Fig. 3B).
RLIP76 depletion caused regression of kidney cancer
xenografts in nude mice. The above observations of the
antineoplastic effects of RLIP76 depletion were examined in a
xenograft model of kidney cancer. Tumor-bearing animals with
established s.c. implanted tumors (f200 mm3; 40 mm2) were
treated with 200 Ag of either RLIP76 antibody, RLIP76 siRNA, or
RLIP76 antisense therapy on day 1 by i.p. injection. Treated animals
had rapid and dramatic reductions in tumors, whereas uncontrolled growth was observed in the control groups. The remarkable
contrast in the outcome of tumors in animals treated with RLIP76
antibody, RLIP76 siRNA, or RLIP76 antisense versus preimmune
serum, scrambled siRNA, or antisense was clearly evident for
kidney cancer cell lines (Fig. 4A). The RLIP76 antibody–treated,
RLIP76 siRNA–treated, or RLIP76 antisense–treated animals with
kidney cancer were still alive at 177 days without evidence of recur-

rence. In comparison, all control animals were censored by day 42
(see Supplementary Figure). Weight gain was comparable with
non–tumor-bearing controls, and no overt toxicity was evident.
The effectiveness of the RLIP76 antisense to deplete RLIP76 in
mouse tissues was shown in separate studies of non–tumorbearing C57B mice by sacrificing animals for analyses at 24 hours
after a single i.p. dose of RLIP76 antisense (200 Ag/100 AL PBS/
mice). Western blot analyses of tissues confirmed detectable level
of RLIP76 in tissues from scrambled antisense–treated animal
and undetectable RLIP76 in RLIP76 antisense–treated animals
(Fig. 4B).
Present studies show nearly complete and sustained regression
of xenografts of Caki-2 kidney cancer by targeted inhibition or
depletion of the mercapturic acid pathway transporter protein
RLIP76. All three agents exhibited marked antineoplastic effects.
These findings indicate that RLIP76 is a key survival protein for
kidney cancer cell and that its depletion/inhibition results in
regression of human kidney cancer xenografts without any
apparent toxicity to animals. Whereas the in vitro effect of the
antibody was relatively less than that of the antisense, the overall
in vivo efficacy was quite similar. RLIP76 performs transport
function when inserted in membrane (45), and other functions
inside the cell, including regulation of the chaperone response
to heat shock as a cytoplasmic binding protein for Hsf1 and
cell cycle–specific termination of endocytosis in conjunction with
cdc2 and GTPase activity toward cdc42 (46). Because the antibody functions to inhibit the transport activity of RLIP76 through

Figure 4. Treatment with RLIP76 antibody, siRNA, or antisense causes regression of established Caki-2 kidney cancer xenografts. A, for xenograft studies,
we used thirty 11-wk-old Hsd:athymic nude nu/nu mice (Harlan) and randomized five animals each into six groups as follows: (a ) preimmune serum, (b ) scrambled
siRNA, (c ) scrambled antisense DNA, (d) RLIP76 antibodies, (e) RLIP76 siRNA, and (f ) RLIP76 antisense. All 30 animals were injected with 2  106 human kidney
cancer cell (Caki-2) suspensions in 100 AL PBS s.c. into one flank of each nu/nu nude mouse. Animals were examined daily for signs of tumor growth. When tumors
reached a cross-sectional area of f42 mm2 (22 d later), animals were randomized to treatment groups as indicated in the figure. Treatment consisted of 200 Ag of
either RLIP76 antibodies, siRNA, or antisense in 100 AL PBS. Control groups were treated with 200 Ag/100 AL of either preimmune serum, scrambled siRNA, or
scrambled antisense DNA. Tumors were measured in two dimensions using calipers. Tumor measurements are presented with all control groups (preimmune IgG,
scrambled siRNA, or antisense) versus all treated groups (anti-RLIP76 IgG, RLIP76 siRNA, or antisense). B, the ability of the RLIP76 antisense (R508) to completely
deplete RLIP76 protein in RLIP76+/+ animals was tested in C57B mice sacrificed at 24 h after one dose of scrambled (control group) or R508 (0.2 mg in 0.1 mL PBS)
i.p. Kidney, brain, and heart tissues were removed from animals and membrane fraction was prepared for Western blot analysis, with application of 200 Ag crude protein
to SDS-PAGE and using anti-RLIP76 IgG as primary antibody, and h-actin was used as an internal control.

Figure 5. A model for regulation of
signaling by RLIP76. Stress (oxidant,
radiant, signaling) causes production of
lipid and other hydroperoxides (ROOH),
which are extremely reactive and capable
of propagating the chain reaction of lipid
peroxidation. The reduction of ROOH to
ROH through peroxidases (prominently
GSTs for lipid hydroperoxides) is linked
to the oxidation of GSH to glutathionyl
disulfide (GSSG ). E, electrophilic species
including epoxides and alkenals that
are generated as downstream (lower
energy) by-products of ROOH (such as
4-hydroxynonenal). These are conjugated
with GSH through GST-catalyzed reactions
to form GS-E, which are subsequently
transported out of the cell by RLIP76.
RLIP76 thus represents a mechanism
for coupling ATP hydrolysis-driven
transmembrane efflux of dianionic GS-E
with endocytosis of various receptor
ligand complexes. RLIP76 is bound to
the endocytosis complex through the
clathrin adaptor AP2 as well as a complex
of POB1/Epsin/Grb/Nck (23, 30).

binding to the cell surface epitope, which contains amino acids 171
to 185 (45), and does not deplete intracellular RLIP76 (or, presumably, interfere with its intracellular function), the somewhat
greater efficacy of siRNA and antisense compared with the
antibody suggests that in kidney cancer, intracellular functions of
RLIP76 are significant contributors to the stress defense functions
of RLIP76. The equal efficacy of the antibody and antisense in vivo
could be due either to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
or a greater role of the transport function of RLIP76 in vivo compared with cultured cells. Most importantly, equivalent outcomes
achieved by depleting or inhibiting RLIP76 offer strong evidence for
target specificity.
The marked effectiveness of this targeted therapy compares
quite favorably with other promising targeted agents in kidney cancer. ZD1839 (gefitinib, Iressa), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, caused
reduction in the rate of growth of SKRC-49 renal cell xenografts
in nude mice when administered by gavage daily for 15 days; the
combination of paclitaxel and ZD1839 was more effective in slowing growth, but regression was not observed (47). Ly294002, a
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, did cause delayed
and incomplete regression by 30 days in xenografts of 786-0
renal cell carcinoma (VHL deficient). When treatment was started
before established visible tumor was present (48). Verotoxin, a
Gb3 (globotriaosylceramide) targeting agent, did cause regression
of very small tumors, but if treatment was started at the time
of established ACHN renal cell tumors at least 6 to 7 mm in each
dimension (as in our case), only relatively little growth inhibition
was seen (49). An anti-CD26 monoclonal antibody was found
effective in xenografts of Caki-2 (VHL expressing), but growth
inhibition occurred rather than regression (50). The nuclear factornB (NF-nB) targeted drug BAY-11-7085 has recently been shown to
nearly completely inhibit the growth of established Caki-1 or 786-0
cell lines in xenografts but also did not cause regression (51).
Incomplete regression was seen by day 30 in xenografts of SKRC-52

(VHL deficient) renal cell carcinoma treated with DAPT (gsecretase inhibitor) targeted at interrupting Notch signaling
(52). Thus, targeted therapeutics for renal cell aimed at receptor
tyrosine kinase, PI3K/Akt, NF-nB, or Notch do not seem as effective as RLIP76 inhibition or depletion in comparable animal xenograft models.
The greater effectiveness of RLIP76 targeted therapy can be
understood in terms of a chemical as well as biochemical signaling
model (Fig. 5). Acute depletion or inhibition of RLIP76 causes
global changes in both chemical signaling as well as kinasemediated signaling. Levels of proapoptotic alkenals and reactive
oxygen species are increased several fold (36), and apoptosis has
been shown to occur as a response to acute RLIP76 inhibition or
depletion in NSCLC, SCLC, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate
cancer, and breast cancer previously (29, 38) and in kidney cancer
in present studies. Alkenals, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, are known
to play a key concentration-dependent role in regulation of cell
proliferation and apoptosis and are known to directly affect
signaling in both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. In
homozygous RLIP76 knockout mouse and mouse embryonic
fibroblast (MEF) studies, we have shown that levels of activated
mitogen-activated protein kinase, Akt, and c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase are markedly increased; despite this increase, these
knockout MEFs are an order of magnitude more sensitive to
chemotherapy drugs or radiation (31, 36). RLIP76 knockout MEFs
have near complete loss of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (31).
Because clathrin-dependent endocytosis plays a key role as the first
step in terminating ligand receptor signaling, an increase in these
signaling pathways that are downstream of ligand receptor
interactions is as expected; however, it is also apparent that these
compensatory mechanisms are insufficient to defend cells from
apoptosis caused by RLIP76 loss.
In conclusion, present studies show that inhibition or depletion of RLIP76 exerts antineoplastic effects in kidney cancer and

indicate that this GS-E and xenobiotic transporters occupy a very
important position in the hierarchy of stress defense mechanisms
necessary for cancer cell survival.
