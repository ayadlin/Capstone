ABSTRACT
Background: Tumor cells produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
which interact with the membrane or cytoplasmic VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) to
promote cell growth in an angiogenesis-independent fashion. Apatinib, a highly
selective VEGFR2 inhibitor, is the only effective drug for patients with terminal gastric
cancer (GC) who have no other chemotherapeutic options. However, its treatment
efficacy is still controversy and the mechanism behind remains undetermined. In this
study, we aimed to investigate the role of autocrine VEGF signaling in the growth of
gastric cancer cells and the efficacy of Apatinib treatment.
Methods: The expression of phosphor VEGFR2 in gastric cancer cell lines was
determined by real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. The gastric
cancer cells were administrated with or without recombination human VEGF (rhVEGF),
VEGFR2 neutralizing antibody, U73122, SU1498, and Apatinib. The nude mice were
used for xenograft tumor model.
Results: we found that autocrine VEGF induced high VEGFR2-expression,
promoted phosphorylation of VEGFR2, and further enhanced internalization of
pVEGFR2 in gastric cancer cells. The autocrine VEGF was self-sustained through
increasing VEGF mRNA and protein expression. It exerted pro-proliferative effect
through a PLC-ERK1/2 dependent pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in
VEGFR2 overexpressing gastric cancer cells, Apatinib inhibited cell proliferation in
vitro and delayed xenograft tumor growth in vivo. However, these effects were not
observed in VEGFR2 low expressing gastric cancer cells.
Conclusion: These results suggested that autocrine VEGF signaling promotes
gastric cancer cell proliferation and enhances Apatinib treatment outcome in VEGFR2
overexpression gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This study would enable
better stratification of gastric cancer patients for clinical treatment decision.

approximately 400,000 new cases in China annually,

advanced gastric cancer remains poor [3]. For instance,
the 5-year survival rate is only 17.0% for stage IIIC gastric

are needed to treat this lethal tumor.
Angiogenesis is important in some physiological
processes, including cell development, wound healing
and pathological processes, especially carcinogenesis
[5–7]. Angiogenesis is regulated markedly by signaling
through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
its receptors, VEGFR1 (Flt-1), VEGFR2 (KDR) and
VEGFR3 (Flt-4) [8]. Tumor cells produce VEGF, which
binds with VEGFRs on the stromal, endothelial and tumor
cells [9–10]. The interaction between VEGF and VEGFRs
results in the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells
to the region surrounding the tumor mass [11–12]. The
resultant neovascularization supplies nutrient to support
tumor proliferation, growth, and metastasis. Tumor
angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer progress.
Therefore, inhibition of VEGF signaling has become an
attractive anti-cancer approach.
Angiogenesis inhibitors (AIs) have been hailed
as the beginning of a new era in cancer therapy. Some
strategies targeting VEGF signaling pathway have been
developed, which include neutralizing antibodies to VEGF
or VEGFRs, soluble VEGFR/VEGFR hybrids and small
molecule VEGFR inhibitors [13]. Bevacizumab, the first
drug that inhibits VEGF signaling to be approved by the
FDA of the USA for cancer treatment, is a monoclonal
neutralizing antibody targeting VEGF [14]. CDP791 and
IMC-1121B both are humanized monoclonal antibodies,
could directly bind to the extracellular domain of VEGFR2
[15]. Aflibercept (VEGF Trap) is a recombinant fusion
protein of the human VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 extracellular
domains and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin
G1 (IgG1) [16]. Sorafenib and Sunitinib are multikinase
inhibitors with antiangiogenic and antitumor properties
that target VEGFRs and other kinases [17–18]. Although
these inhibitors could prolong the survival time of tumor
patients to a certain extent, the side effect of drugs had
adversely influences patient’s quality of life.
Apatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of
VEGFR2 that has anti-cancer activity in some solid tumors
[19]. Some studies have confirmed that Apatinib was a
more selective inhibitor of VEGFR2 than Sunitinib and
Sorafenib, with a 10 times binding affinity of Vatalanib
and Sorafenib [20]. Apatinib exhibited objective efficacy
in heavily pretreated, metastatic non-triple-negative
breast cancer with manageable toxicity, and it was a better
choice to be used in breast cancer with high angiogenesis
dependency [21–22]. In a phase III clinical trial, Apatinib
has been proven to be the only effective pharmacy in the
treatment of patients with terminal gastric cancer who do
not have other chemotherapeutic options [20]. Although
Apatinib has been confirmed effectively in the treatment
of solid tumors, our knowledge about the molecular
mechanism of the drug action remained obscure.
While the effects of VEGF on endothelial and
stromal cells in angiogenesis is well known, some studies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggest that autocrine VEGF signaling in cancer cells
plays an important role in affecting cell proliferation and
apoptosis [23–24]. Zhang et al [9] and Peng et al [25]
confirmed that autocrine VEGF signaling could promote
malignant cell proliferation. However, the autocrine VEGF
signaling on GC has not been investigated. In this study,
we investigated the role of autocrine VEGF signaling on
cell proliferation in gastric cancer cells and explored how
autocrine VEGF signaling modulates Apatinib efficacy in
the treatment of GC.

RESULTS
Differential expression of VEGF, pVEGFR2, and
VEGFR2 in gastric cancer cell lines
Some studies indicated that proteins on VEGF
signaling pathway were differentially expressed in cancer
cells. To determine these expression in gastric cancer
cell lines, we firstly detected the mRNA levels of VEGF
(Figure 1A, left panel) and VEGFR2 (Figure 1A, right
panel) in 5 gastric cancer cells (AGS, SGC-7901, BGC823, MGC-803, and HGC-27). We found that VEGF
and VEGFR2 mRNA levels were significantly higher
in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 than other cell lines. Then,
we detected the protein level of VEGF, pVEGFR2 and
VEGFR2 in these gastric cancer cell lines. The activated
VEGFR2, phosphorylation of VEGFR2 (pVEGFR2), were
differently expressed, while the higher level in SGC-7901
and BGC-823, and the lower level in MGC-803, AGS,
and HGC-27 (Figure 1B). The mRNA and protein level of
VEGFR1 were similarly with VEGR2 in all the cell lines
(data not shown). As Apatinib is a highly selective VEGF
receptor 2 inhibitor which has little affinity to VEGFR1,
we further focus on investigating the role of VEGFR 2 in
gastric cancer cell proliferation.
Since secretion of VEGF is required for autocrine
signaling, we assessed the amount of VEGF protein
secreted in cultured medium by ELISA assay. Gastric
cancer cells could secrete VEGF into the medium,
especially the BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cell lines (Figure
1C). According to the level of VEGFR2 and VEGF,
BGC-823, SGC-7901 and MGC-803 were chosen for
investigating the mechanism of autocrine VEGF signaling
in cell proliferation in gastric cancer.
As a receptor of VEGF, VEGFR2 located on
cell membrane; however, some studies indicated that
VEGFR2 could translocate into intracellular [24, 27].
To detect the expression levels of VEGF and VEGFR2
in the membrane, cytoplasm and nuclei, we performed
Western blot with fractionated membrane, cytoplasm and
nuclear proteins from SGC-7901, BGC-823 and MGC803. The data demonstrated that VEGFR2 was mostly
located in the cytoplasm and membrane, whereas the
activated form, pVEGFR2, was observed primarily in
the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 1D). Furthermore, the

secretion. VEGF-NA, VEGFR2-NA and SU1498
(inhibitor of VEGFR2) were used to block VEGFVEGFR2 signaling by neutralizing VEGF in extracellular,
blocking extracellular or intracellular fragment of
VEGFR2. We found that these inhibitors had no significant
effect on cell proliferation in MGC-803 cells which with
lower pVEGFR2 expression (Figure 2C), but significantly
decreased cell viability in SGC-7901 (Figure 2A) and
BGC-823 (Figure 2B), which have higher pVEGFR2
expression. By detecting VEGF protein level in cultural
medium, compare to SGC-7901 (Figure 2D) and BGC823 (Figure 2E), although VEGF protein level decreased
in MGC-803 (Figure 2F), it did not show statistical
significance. This demonstrated that inhibition of VEGFVEGFR2 signaling decreases secretion of its own ligand.

Autocrine VEGF signaling promoted cell

Some studies demonstrated that activated VEGFR2
could translocate into the nucleus and acted as a
transcription factor to modulate cell function [24, 27]. To
investigate whether this phenomenon also exists in gastric
cancer cells, SGC-7901, and BGC-823 cells were treated
with rhVEGF. Western blot and immunofluorescence
(IF) were performed to observe the localization of
pVEGFR2. After the administration with rhVEGF, the
nuclear expression of pVEGFR2 increased in SGC-7901
and BGC-823 (Figure 3A). In order to explore whether
blocking VEGFR2 could inhibit pVEGFR2 nuclear
translocation, cells were firstly administrated with
SU1498 which is a small molecular inhibitor of VEGFR2,
following the administration of rhVEGF. We found that
nuclear translocation of pVEGFR2 was suppressed by
SU1498. However, rhVEGF could not reverse the effects
(Figure 3B). These results were consistent with what we

To determine whether the increased expression of
VEGF and activated VEGFR2 are positively associated
with cell proliferation in gastric cancer cells, we treated
cells with recombination human VEGF (rhVEGF) to
characterize the VEGF-mediated cell proliferation. By
administrating SGC-7901, BGC-823, and MGC-803 cells
with rhVEGF, the cell viability was significantly increased
in BGC-823 (Figure 4A, middle panel) and SGC-7901
(Figure 4A, left panel) in a dose- and time-dependent
manner, but not in MGC-803 (Figure 4A, right panel).
On the base that gastric cancer cells overexpressing
VEGFR2 were responsive to rhVEGF treatment, we next
investigated whether the physiological concentration of
VEGF could promote gastric cancer cell proliferation.
We incubated cells with condition medium (CM), which
contains the physiological concentration of VEGF, with
the presence or absence of VEGF-neutralizing antibody.

The cell proliferation of SGC-7901 (Figure 4B, left panel)
and BGC-823 (Figure 4B, middle panel) in its CM was
significantly higher than those in basal medium (BM),
which was obviously revised by VEGF-NA. On the other
hand, the cell proliferation of MGC-803 was not enhanced
by its CM (Figure 4B, right panel). To elucidate whether
autocrine VEGF signaling initiated the self-sustainable
cell growth, we measured VEGF expression following
the rhVEGF stimulation in cells with higher activated
VEGFR2 expression and found that by triggering cells
with rhVEGF, the expression of VEGF increased at 12
hours and reached the peak at 48 hours (Figure 4C). We
further verified these findings by qRT-PCR assay (Figure
4D) and ELISA assay (Figure 4E).

823 cells for investigating this phenomenon. SGC-7901
and BGC-823 cells were treated with rhVEGF and the
potential signaling molecules were examined at different
time intervals. The expression of pVEGFR2 increased at
15 min after rhVEGF treatment in SGC-7901 and BGC803 cell lines and maintained at a high level in 30 min
and 60 min. Increased levels of phosphorylate-PLCγ1 and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were
also detected in SGC-7901 and BGC-803 cell lines. We
found that PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 were activated after the
treatment of rhVEGF (Figure 5A). These results suggested
that VEGFR2 signals activated at least partially through
PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 pathways in gastric cancer cells.
To further investigate the role of PLCγ1 in gastric
cancer cell proliferation, we treated gastric cancer cells
with a PLCγ1 inhibitor, U73122, to observe if it will
affect gastric cancer cell viability. Compared to the
control group (Dimethyl Sulphoxide (DMSO) used
only), U73122 significantly decreased SGC-7901 and
BGC-823 cell proliferation at the concentrations of 1μM,
2.5μM, and 5μM (Figure 5B), and rhVEGF could not
reverse the inhibitory effect of U73122 (Figure 5C). To
confirm whether U73122 could inhibit the activation of
PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 which induced by rhVEGF, cells
were treated with DMSO or 5μM of U73122 overnight,
followed by 30min exposure to rhVEGF. Again, without
U73122, rhVEGF induced the phosphorylation of
PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells.
However, administration with U73122 diminished the

Given that VEGFR2 activity was associated with
gastric cancer cell proliferation, we further investigated the
underlying mechanism in vitro. It has been demonstrated
that autocrine VEGF signaling promotes cell proliferation
through a Phosphoinositide phospholipase C γ1 (PLCγ1)
-dependent pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma
cells and neoplastic Barrett’s epithelial cells [9, 25].
However, whether this effect existed in GC has not been
investigated. In this study, we selected highly VEGFexpressed and VEGFR2-actived SGC-7901 and BGC-

reverse Apatinib’s inhibitory effect (Figure 6B) in these
cells. However, under the same concentration of Apatinib,
cell proliferation was not suppressed in MGC-803 cells
which had lower expression of VEGF signaling pathway
(Figure 6A right panel). Moreover, Apatinib decreased
VEGF secretion in a dose-dependent fashion in SGC-7901
(Figure 6B, left panel) and BGC-823 (Figure 6B, middle
panel), but did not suppress VEGF secretion of MGC803 cells (Figure 6B, right panel). We also confirmed that
PLCγ1-ERK1/2 signaling pathway was responsible for
the increment of cell proliferation induced by rhVEGF
stimulation. We treated cells with DMSO or 500 nM
of Apatinib overnight followed by 30min exposure to
rhVEGF. Without Apatinib, rhVEGF treatment induced
the phosphorylation of VEGFR2, PLCγ1, and ERK1/2
in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells. However, Apatinib
diminished the rhVEGF induced phosphorylated VEGFR2,
PLCγ1, and ERK1/2 to a sub-baseline level (Figure 6D).
Taken together, Apatinib inhibited cell proliferation and
VEGF secretion in cells that overexpressed VEGFR2,
pVEGFR2, and VEGF.

by injecting SGC-7901, BGC-823, and MGC-803 cells
subcutaneously into nude mice. When the mice developed
a palpable mass (diameter≥0.5cm), they were treated with
either Apatinib (50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle solution daily
until sacrifice. The tumors formed by SGC-7901 or BGC823 cell in mice which treated by Apatinib displayed a
substantial delayed in growth after 4 days of treatment,
as compared to the vehicle groups. The mean tumor
volumes and tumor weights were significantly decreased
between the vehicle and Apatinib-treated groups when
the mice were sacrificed (Figure 7A&7B). However, in
the xenograft tumor model formed by the MGC-803 cell
which with lower activated VEGFR2 expression, the
tumor growth, the mean tumor volumes, and tumor weight
between the vehicle and Apatinib-treated groups did not
show a significant difference (Figure 7A, 7B &7C). Using
IHC staining for the cell proliferating index Ki-67, we
found that Apatinib treatment reduced the number of Ki67 positive cells in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 tumors, but
not in the MGC-803 tumors (Figure 7D).

DISCUSSION

The efficacy of Apatinib on suppressing gastric
cancer growth in xenograft tumor models

In this study, we showed that gastric cancer cells
produced VEGF which promoted tumor cell growth
by activating VEGFR2. When activated by VEGF, the
VEGFR2 were phosphorylated and trans-localized from
cell membrane to cytoplasm and nucleus in gastric

To further explore the effect of Apatinib on gastric
cancer cells with different activated VEGF signaling
molecules, we established xenograft mouse tumor models

cancer cells. In addition, cell proliferation and secretion
of VEGF decreased when VEGFR2 inhibited by NA or
small molecular VEGFR2 inhibitors. We demonstrated
that autocrine VEGF signaling promoted gastric cancer
cell proliferation in a PLC-ERK1/2 dependent pathway.
Administrating gastric cancer cells with Apatinib
suppressed cell proliferation, decreased VEGF secretion,
and reduced VEGF, pVEGFR2, PLC and ERK1/2
expression in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that gastric cancer cells that overexpressed
VEGFR2 and VEGF were more sensitive to the growth
suppressive effects of Apatinib. In vivo, treatment with
Apatinib delayed VEGFR2 and VEGF overexpressing
gastric cancer cell xenograft tumor growth and decreased
tumor weight and volume.
It is well acknowledged that tumor-derived VEGF
mediated the functions of endothelial cells in the tumor
microenvironment [8]. However, little is known regarding
the role of autocrine VEGF signaling in gastric cancer
cells. There were increasing studies support the notion
that VEGF, acting as a growth factor, has a direct effect
on tumor cells and can sustain tumor cell growth in an
angiogenesis-independent fashion [26]. VEGF could
directly induce activation of VEGFR2 that lead to the
activation of downstream signaling molecules in a cell
proliferation pathway [27], suggesting that a functional
VEGF autocrine loop may exist in GC. In endothelial
cells, VEGF binding to VEGFR2 has been shown to
induce its phosphorylation and translocation from cell
surface to nucleus, where the VEGFR2 bind to the
promoter to regulate its own transcription [9, 27]. Nuclear
translocation of VEGFRs amplified angiogenesis and cell
proliferation effects [26]. In this study, by Western blot
and IF, we found that rhVEGF can activate VEGFR2 and
induced its nuclear translocation, suggesting the existence
of autocrine VEGF signaling loop in gastric cancer cells.
Autocrine VEGF signaling promotes tumor
cell proliferation and viability through angiogenesisindependent pathways in several tumor types [23–24].
In gastric cancer cell lines, we found that treatment
of rhVEGF increased cell viability, suggesting that
exogenous VEGF signaling contributes to epithelial
cell growth in gastric cancer cell lines. VEGFR2-NA
competitively binds to VEGFR2 on the cell surface
and inhibits the activation of VEGFR2. When treating
cells with VEGFR2-NA for 24 hours, exogenous VEGF
signaling did not increase cell viability. SU1498, the
VEGFR2 inhibitor, can enter to the cytoplasm, binds to
VEGFR2 fragments and inhibits the phosphorylation
of VEGFR2. In this study, the treatment of SU1498 for
24 hours significantly inhibited cell proliferation, but
exogenous VEGF signaling did not reverse the inhibitory
effects of SU1498. Moreover, we found that the use of
SU1498 decreased the production of VEGF. These results
indicated that VEGF signaling promotes gastric cancer
cell proliferation through an autocrine pathway. Therefore

agents that target VEGFR2 could be used for prevention
or treatment of GC.
To further explore the downstream molecular events
in autocrine VEGF signaling, we stimulated gastric cancer
cell with exogenous VEGF (rhVEGF) and observed
the effects of a series of pharmacologic inhibitors. We
found that VEGF signaling promotes gastric cancer cell
proliferation by inducing the phosphorylation of PLC and
ERK pathway. It is reported that VEGFR2 activated ERK
directly through Ras, or indirectly through the PLC/PKC
pathway [9, 28]. We observed that the inhibitor against
PLC significantly reduced the expression of activated
ERK, suggesting that VEGF activated ERK indirectly
through PLC in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, we
confirmed that after blocking PLC, the production of
VEGF decreased. These results suggested that inhibition
of PLC decreased ERK activation, cell proliferation and
VEGF secretion in gastric cancer cells.
Although Apatinib, a selective inhibitor of
VEGFR2, has been approved by the FDA of the USA for
the treatment of GC and confirmed to be a well effective
treatment for gastric cancer patients [14], the molecular
mechanism of Apatinib on the tumorigenesis of GC
is still obscure. In this study, we found that Apatinib
decreased cell proliferation and the production of VEGF
in a dose-dependent fashion in gastric cancer cells
which overexpressed VEGFR2 and VEGF, other than
in low expression gastric cancer cell. Similarly, in the
xenograft tumor models, treatment of Apatinib resulted
in a significant delay in growth of tumor which formed
by overexpressed other than low expressed VEGFR2 and
VEGF gastric cancer cells. In summary, we demonstrated
that Apatinib not only has anti-angiogenesis effects but
also possesses substantial angiogenesis-independent
effects. More importantly, we found that gastric cancer
cells that overexpressed VEGFR2 and VEGF were more
sensitive to the growth suppressive effects of Apatinib.
These findings may enable better stratification of gastric
cancer patients for clinical treatment decision.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Five human gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, SGC7901, BGC-823, MGC-803, and HGC-27) were obtained
from the Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Medical
Science (Shanghai, China). Cell lines were cultured in
RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco, Life technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc.), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100
mg/mL). Recombinant VEGF was from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN). Apatinib (HengRui Medicine Co.
LTD, Jiangsu, China), VEGF Receptor 2 neutralize
antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN.), SU1498

(Abcam plc, UK), U73122 (Sellock, Shanghai, China),
were also used in our study (Supplementary Table 1).

cells/well in 100μL CM or serum-free RIMP 1640 culture
medium in the presence or absence of rhVEGF-NA,
rhVEGF, VEGF receptor 2 neutralizing antibody, U73122,
SU1498 and Apatinib for 24 hours. Then, 10μL CCK-8
reagents (Dongjido, Japan) were added to each well for 2
hours incubation at 37 °C according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The absorbance was read at the wavelength
of 450 nm in an automated plate reader. The experiments
were repeated at least three times.

Western blot
Total protein, nuclear, cytoplasmic and membranous
protein was extracted from cell culture according to
instructions from respective protein extraction kits (Beibo,
China). The protein concentration was quantified using
an Enhanced BCA Protein Assay Kit. Fifty micrograms
of protein from each sample were separated on 8% SDSPAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P,
Millipore, US). The primary antibodies used were as follows:
anti-VEGF, anti-VEGF Receptor 2, anti-phosphorylated
VEGF Receptor 2, anti-PLCγ1, anti- phosphorylated
PLCγ1, anti-ERK1/2, anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2, antiGAPDH, anti-Tubulin, anti-Histone H3 (Cell Signaling
Technology Inc., US, Supplementary Table 2). The blots
were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence
detection system (Tanon 5200, Shanghai, China). The
experiments were repeated at least three times.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
Gastric cancer cells were administrated with
reagents for 4-6 hours, then washed with PBS 3 times and
replenish with serum-free RIMP 1640 medium. Cells were
incubated for 24 hours and media were collected for the
VEGF concentration assay using an ELISA kit (Novex,
Life technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Briefly,
a total of 100 μl/well condition medium and standard
samples were added to the antibody-coated 96 well plates
and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature, followed
by addition of the biotin-conjugated polyclonal antibody
specific for VEGF and incubation for 1 hour. Plates were
then washed and incubated with avidin conjugated to HRP
for 1 hour. The color was developed using TMB substrate,
stopped by adding sulfuric acid and measured using a plate
reader (infinite F50, Tecan) at a wavelength of 450 nm.
The experiments were repeated at least three times.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR)
Total RNAs were extracted from cell pellets by using
the RNA plus reagent kit (TaKaRa, Japan). Complementary
DNA was synthesized using oligodT primers according to the
protocol supplied with the Primer Script TM RT Reagent
(TaKaRa, Japan) (Supplementary Table 3). Expression of
VEGF was determined by quantitative real-time PCR using
Power SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems).
The ratio of target gene and GAPDH mRNA expression
in AGS cell was used as the normalization data. The
experiments were repeated at least three times.

Immunohistochemistry
Tumor masses from xenograft experiments were
processed using standard histological procedures, and tumors
were evaluated for Ki67 staining. For IHC, deparaffinized
sections were pretreated with 10 mM sodium citrate buffer
for antigen unmasking (pH 6.0, boiling temperature, 30
min), blocked in normal serum (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector
Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA), incubated with primary
antibodies at 4°C overnight, rinsed, and incubated with
secondary antibody (Vectastain ABC kit). Signals were
amplified using Vectastain ABC kit per manufacturer’s
instruction. Targeted protein was visualized using
diaminobenzidine as substrate. The results were interpreted
by two independent pathologists who were blinded to the
specific diagnosis and prognosis for each case. Counts reflect
the pathologists’ consensus. The intensity of IHC staining
was estimated by a semi-quantitative scoring method.

Immunofluorescence staining
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
20 minutes at room temperature. After washing with
PBS, the Triton-100 was applied for cell membrane
permeabilization for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Cells were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin to
block the nonspecific binding sites. Primary antibodies
were incubated with cells at 4°C overnight. After washing
with PBS, the cells were then incubated with the secondary
antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. 0.5μg/ml DAPI
was used to stain cell nucleus. Cells were observed and
photographs were taken in a fluorescence microscope. The
experiments were repeated at least three times.

Collection of condition medium
The gastric cancer cells were grown in 15cm
diameter cell culture dishes until around 80% confluency.
The medium was aspirated off, and the monolayer was
washed three times with PBS, once with serum-free
RIMP-1640, and then replenished with serum-free
RIMP-1640. After 48 hours incubation, the medium was
collected, filtered and stored at -80°C until use.

Cell counting Kit 8 (CCK8) assay
Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used
to examine cell proliferation ability. In brief, cells
were planted onto 96-well cell culture plates (Nest
Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China) at a density of 2×103

In conclusion, our study provided evidence of
angiogenesis independent VEGF effects in gastric cancer
cells. We demonstrated that VEGF, produced by gastric
cancer cells, activates VEGFR2-PLC-ERK pathway that
evokes cell proliferation and the production of VEGF.
We also found that Apatinib, a small molecular VEGFR2
inhibitor, can inhibit cell proliferation and the secretion
of VEGF. Gastric cancer cells that overexpressed VEGF
and VEGFR2 were more sensitive to the treatment of
Apatinib because of VEGF/VEGFR2 inhibition. These
results suggested that agents targeting molecules involved
in autocrine VEGF signaling might be used for prevention
and treatment of GC.
