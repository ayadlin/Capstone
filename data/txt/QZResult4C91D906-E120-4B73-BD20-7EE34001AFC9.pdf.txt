Abstract
Cancer stem–like cells (CSC) thought to contribute to head and neck squamous carcinomas (HNSCC) may
offer attractive therapeutic targets if a tractable approach can be developed. In this study, we report that
silencing c-Met is sufﬁcient to suppress sphere formation, tumor initiation, and metastatic properties of HNCSC. Pharmacologic inhibition of c-Met with the selective inhibitor PF-2341066 preferentially targeted CSC
and synergized with conventional chemotherapy to improve efﬁcacy in a mouse xenograft model of HNSCC,
impeding tumor growth and reducing metastasis. Mechanistic investigations showed that CSC elimination
was due to downregulation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in HN-CSC and that the Wnt pathway receptor FZD8
was essential for interactions of c-Met and Wnt/b-catenin signaling in HN-CSC. Notably, ectopic expression
of FZD8 rescued the impaired phenotype of HN-CSC where c-Met was inhibited. Furthermore, c-Met
upregulated FZD8 through the ERK/c-Fos cascade in HN-CSC. Taken together, our results offer a preclinical
proof-of-concept for targeting the c-Met/FZD8 signaling axis as a CSC-directed therapy to improve HNSCC
treatment. Cancer Res; 74(24); 7546–59. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is
the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with an incidence of
approximately 600,000 cases per year and mortality rate of
approximately 50% (1, 2). Despite advances in therapeutic
approaches over the past decades, little improvement has been
achieved in the survival rate for HNSCC (3). Mortality remains
high because of the emergence of therapy-resistant local
recurrences and the development of distant metastases (4).
Thus, a profound understanding of HNSCC tumorigenesis and
more effective therapeutic strategies are critical for improving
clinical outcome of this deadly disease.

Many human cancers contain cancer stem-like cells (CSC),
which are proposed to persist in tumors as a distinct population and cause relapse and metastasis by giving rise to new
tumors, thereby facilitating tumor growth (5–7) and resistance
to therapy (8, 9). Similar to other types of malignancies, recent
evidence suggests that CSCs play a pivotal role in the development and progression of HNSCC (4, 10–12). However, current treatments target the bulk of the tumor cells rather than
CSCs, which may explain the subsequent recurrence and
metastasis (13). Therefore, the development of therapies speciﬁcally targeting CSCs holds hope for the improvement of
cancer patient survival. Although it has been proposed that
targeting self-renewal pathways in CSCs, such as the Wnt,
Notch, and Hedgehog pathways (14), or speciﬁc CSC markers,
such as CD133 (15), CXCR1 (16, 17), and CD44 (18), may offer
therapeutic beneﬁts to cancer therapy, evidence for the beneﬁts of blocking these pathways and markers in HNSCC has not
been reported thus far.
Our previous study identiﬁed c-Met as a self-renewal marker
of CSCs in HNSCC patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX;
ref. 12). Consistently, recent studies have shown that c-Met is
also a biomarker in glioblastoma stem cell subtypes and
pancreatic CSCs (19–22). c-Met is activated and functional in
glioblastoma stem cells and its activity correlates with the
expression of other stem cell markers in clinical glioblastoma
specimens (22). These observations prompted us to deﬁne
whether the c-Met signaling axis may comprise an effective
target for CSC-directed therapy in HNSCC and to explore
the underlying mechanism of c-Met in the maintenance of
HNSCC patient-derived CSCs (HN-CSC).

Targeting the c-Met/FZD8 Axis Eliminates HNCSCs

Materials and Methods
Patient primary specimens
Patient primary HNSCC specimens were collected within
one hour after surgery under guidelines approved by the
Institutional Review and the Ethics Boards at Shanghai Jiao
Tong University School of Medicine (Shanghai, China). Written
informed consent was obtained from patients in all cases at the
time of enrollment. None of the patients had undergone
preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Histologic examination was carried out by two pathologists. Tumors were
graded according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer/
International Union Against Cancer staging system.
Single-cell suspensions derived from primary specimens
Primary HNSCC specimens were placed in PBS containing
125 mg/mL gentamicin and 1 mg/mL Amphotericin B and
washed 3 times, with 20 minutes for each wash. Tissues were
then minced completely using a sterile scalpel to yield 1–2 mm3
pieces and enzymatically digested with ultra-pure collagenase
IV (Worthington Biochemical Co.) in DMEM at 37 C for 120
minutes. Cells were ﬁltered through a 40 mm strainer after
incubation.
Sphere-forming assays
Single-cell populations were resuspended in culture media
containing 1% N2 supplement (Gibco), 2% B27 supplement
(Gibco), 20 ng/mL bFGF-2 (Invitrogen), and 20 ng/mL EGF
(Gibco) and plated in ultra-low attachment plates (Corning) at
a density of 1  103 (for sphere cells) or 1  104 (for bulk HNSCC
cells) cells per well. For subsequent passaging, the spheres were
collected and dissociated with 0.05% trypsin and then sieved
through a 40-mm strainer. Dissociated cells were washed with
serum-free Hank's balanced salt solution for cell sorting or
cultured in ultra-low attachment plates for subsequent experiments. To evaluate the sphere size, cells were plated in 96-well
ultra-low attachment plates (Corning) at a density of 1 cell per
well. The number of spheres formed was counted using an
inverted microscope.
Establishment of HNSCC PDXs
Necrotic tissues were removed from clinical tumor samples,
and then the samples were transferred to a sterile Petri dish
containing Medium 199 with 1:100 penicillin/streptomycin
and washed 3 times, with 30 minutes for each wash. The
clinical tumor samples were cut into approximately 3-mm
pieces, followed by subcutaneous implantation into the ﬂanks
of NOD/SCID mice. At 1–4 months after implantation, tumors
began to appear at the site of implantation. When the tumors
reached approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, they were excised,
dissected into 5-mm cubes, and implanted into another set of
mice using the same procedure. The passage harboring the
patient-derived material was termed P0, with subsequent
generations numbered consecutively (P1, P2, P3, and so on).
In this study, the third generation (P3) was expanded for drug
treatment. To date, we have established 15 PDXs from 47
HNSCC samples. Among them, three PDXs were selected
because we also succeeded to isolate CSCs from their corresponding patient samples.

Animal experiments
For in vivo limiting dilution injection, the indicated numbers
of cells were dissociated from spheres, differentiated cell
populations, or xenografts and suspended in serum-free
RPMI1640/Matrigel mixture (1:1 volume). The cells were then
injected into NOD/SCID mice, and tumor incidence was
evaluated weekly for 16 weeks. Tumor volume was measured
according to the equation: tumor volume ¼ (p/6)  (L  W2),
where L and W are the longer and shorter dimensions of the
tumor. For intracardiac injection, NOD/SCID mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 1.5% isoﬂuorane/air mixture. Approximately 1  105 sphere cells suspended in 100 mL Dulbecco PBS
solution were injected into the left ventricle of anesthetized
mice over about 1 minute. Ill or paralyzed animals were
sacriﬁced by ether inhalation. For bioluminescent imaging,
anesthetized mice were injected intraperitoneally with D-luciferin (150 mg/kg, Caliper Life Sciences) and placed in the lighttight box of the IVIS imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences). For
photon ﬂux counting, we used a charge-coupled device camera
system with a nose-cone isoﬂuorane delivery system and
heated stage for maintaining body temperature. Results were
analyzed after 2 to 12 minutes of exposure using Living Image
software provided with the Xenogen imaging system. Photon
numbers are shown as maximum number of radiance from one
of the pixels in the region of interest or the average radiance of
the entire area. Radiance is shown as photons/second/cm2/
steradian (photons/sec/cm2/sr).
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as the mean  SD for at least three
experiments for each group. Statistical differences were determined using ANOVA and the Student t test for independent
samples. Treatment differences with respect to survival were
assessed via the log-rank test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical software SAS 9.1.3 was used for all
analyses.
For more detailed methods, see Supplementary Experimental Procedures.

Results
Identiﬁcation and enrichment of CSCs directly from
clinical HNSCC specimens
We previously identiﬁed a c-MethighCD44high CSC population in HNSCC xenografts (12). To determine the potential of
the c-Met signaling axis in CSCs as a target for the treatment of
HNSCC, we using established CSC markers to isolate three HNCSC lines (HN-CSC#1, HN-CSC#2, and HN-CSC#3) from fresh
tissue samples derived from three patients (HN-0-22, HN-0-29,
and HN-0-46, respectively; Supplementary Table S1). These
HN-CSCs can efﬁciently form tumors that recapitulate the
heterogeneous morphology of the parental tumors upon xenografting in NOD/SCID mice (Supplementary Table S2 and
Supplementary Fig. S1A). To establish long-term cultures of
HN-CSCs, the lines were propagated as spheres in ultra-low
attachment plates (Fig. 1A) and could be passaged at least 18
generations with undiminished efﬁciency (data not shown).
Immunoﬂuorescent staining showed that the spheres have

high expression levels of several known HN-CSC markers,
including aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), c-Met, CD44,
and BMI-1 (Fig. 1B). When these spheres were cultured in the
presence of 10% serum as previously described (23, 24), they
began to attach onto the ﬂasks and grew as their differentiated
progenies. We analyzed the differential expression of ALDH, cMet, and CD44 between spheres and their differentiated progenies using ﬂow cytometry. The spheres contained a higher
proportion of CSCs than their differentiated progenies
(Fig. 1C–F). For example, more than 80% of sphere cells had
higher ALDH activity, but less than 0.5% of the cells maintained
this phenotype after 6 days of differentiation (Fig. 1C). A high
proportion of c-MethighCD44high cells was present in the
sphere cells shortly after isolation (Fig. 1E, panel 1), but the
proportion of double positive cells was progressively decreased
after differentiation under adherent conditions (Fig. 1E,

panels 2–4). The sphere cells expressed high levels of stem
cell–associated genes, such as BMI-1 (4, 25) and Oct-4 (26),
which declined under in vitro differentiation conditions
(Fig. 1G). Immunoﬂuorescent staining also showed that cells
differentiated for 6 days (differentiated-6d cells) have high
expression of the differentiated keratinocyte marker involucrin
(Supplementary Fig. S1B).
We further validated the enrichment of CSCs in sphere cells
using in vivo assays. As shown in Fig. 1H, tumors developed in
22 of 36 mice when 50–5  102 sphere cells were implanted,
whereas no tumor formation was observed when the same
number of differentiated-6d cells were injected, which is
consistent with increased CSC frequency under sphere-forming conditions. Four of 18 mice injected with 5  103 differentiated-6d cells developed tumors, but these tumors were
smaller than those derived from the same number of sphere

cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Intriguingly, sphere-derived
tumors grew faster and upon dissociation, generated secondary tumors with high efﬁciency, whereas a comparable size
of tumors derived from differentiated-6d cells did not (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Furthermore, sphere-derived tumors
recapitulated the patient tumor histology and cytoarchitecture (Supplementary Fig. S1A). These results suggest that
c-MethighCD44high cell–derived spheres are suitable and convenient source of HN-CSCs for subsequent experiments.
Knockdown of c-Met inhibits the properties of HN-CSCs
To examine the role of c-Met in HN-CSCs, we performed serial sphere propagation assays. Sphere cells derived
from HN-CSC#1, HN-CSC#2, and HN-CSC#3 were infected
with lentivirus expressing nonspeciﬁc shRNA (scramble) or
c-Met–speciﬁc shRNAs (shRNA1 and shRNA2). Knockdown

of c-Met resulted in approximately 80% reduction of c-Met
expression at the both protein and mRNA level (Supplementary Fig. S2). Cells expressing either scramble shRNA or cMet shRNA were allowed to form spheres again, and the
spheres were dissociated and passaged for three additional
generations. The scramble shRNA did not affect the sphereforming efﬁciency, whereas the c-Met-shRNAs signiﬁcantly
reduced the sphere formation (Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Although sphere cells with c-Met knockdown
retained limited sphere-forming potential, the size of the
resultant spheres was signiﬁcantly smaller (Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S3B). These results indicate that knockdown of c-Met inhibits CSC self-renewal.
To examine the role of c-Met in tumor initiation, seriallimiting dilutions of sphere cells expressing scramble shRNA
or c-Met shRNAs were subcutaneously inoculated into

NOD/SCID mice. As shown in Supplementary Table S3, 50
control sphere cells were able to form tumor, whereas sphere
cells with c-Met knockdown had a dramatic reduction in
tumorigenesis. To examine whether this phenomenon can be
observed in subsequent transplants, we isolated tumor cells
from mice with scramble shRNA and generated spheres
(referred to as 2 spheres). These 2 sphere cells were reinfected with scramble shRNA or c-Met shRNAs lentivirus.
As shown in Supplementary Table S3, scramble shRNAinfected 2 sphere cells maintained their potential to generate
tumors when as few as 50 cells were injected, whereas 2 sphere
cells with c-Met knockdown no longer possessed high tumorinitiating ability.
We used an orthotropic approach to assess the effect of
c-Met on primary tumor growth. To this end, 1  104 sphere
cells were co-infected with luciferase-expressing lentivirus
and scramble shRNA or c-Met-shRNAs and then inoculated
into the tongue of NOD/SCID mice (n ¼ 6 per group).
Knockdown of c-Met signiﬁcantly inhibited orthotropic
tumor growth and incidence (Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Fig. S3C). Tumors generated from control sphere cells were
conﬁrmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Supplementary Fig. S3E).
To examine whether knockdown of c-Met reduces the
metastatic ability of HN-CSCs, approximately 1  105 sphere
cells that were coinfected with lentivirus expressing scramble
shRNA or c-Met shRNA and luciferase were introduced into
NOD/SCID mice (n ¼ 6 per group) by intracardiac injection.
Knockdown of c-Met signiﬁcantly inhibited metastasis. Luciferase images of a representative mouse for each group at each
time point is shown (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S3D).
Metastatic tumors from control sphere cells were conﬁrmed
using H&E staining (Supplementary Fig. S3F).
Pharmacologic inhibition of c-Met preferentially targets
HN-CSCs
The c-Met signaling pathway has been explored as an
attractive target for multiple malignancies (27). We examined the therapeutic potential of c-Met inhibitor PF-2341066
on HN-CSCs and their corresponding differentiated-6d
cell progenies. Because tumor cells derived from patient
HN-0-22, HN-0-29, and HN-0-46 were resistant to both
5-ﬂuorouracil and cisplatin but sensitive to docetaxel (Supplementary Fig. S4), docetaxel was selected to clearly display
the differential effectiveness between PF-2341066 and conventional cancer treatments. We found that HN-CSC#1 cells
were more sensitive to PF-2341066 than docetaxel (Fig. 2E);
in contrast, the differentiated cells were more sensitive to
docetaxel (Fig. 2F). Similar results were observed with HNCSC#2 and HN-CSC#3 cells (data not shown).
To determine the effect of c-Met inhibitors on CSC selfrenewal, we exposed HN-CSC#1 cells to various concentrations
of PF-2341066. Sphere formation was inhibited in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, when cells dissociated from PF-2341066–treated primary spheres were cultured in the absence of PF-2341066, a signiﬁcant decrease in
the sphere formation also occurred in the secondary and
tertiary passages (Fig. 2H). Similar results were observed with

7550

Cancer Res; 74(24) December 15, 2014

HN-CSC#2 cells and HN-CSC#3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Similar results were also obtained with another c-Met inhibitor SU11274 (Supplementary Fig. S6). As expected, the concentration of PF-2341066 required for inhibiting sphere
formation was correlated with the reduced activity of c-Met,
ERK, and AKT (Fig. 2I).
Pharmacologic inhibition of c-Met eliminates CSCs
and enhances the therapeutic efﬁcacy of traditional
chemotherapy in HNSCC patient-derived tumor
xenografts
PDXs are considered to represent the heterogeneity of
human cancers and advanced preclinical models (28). To
explore the potential of c-Met inhibitors for CSC-directed
therapy in human HNSCC, we established a series of mouse
xenografts with clinical HNSCC specimens. Among them,
three PDXs generated from patient HN-0-22, HN-0-29, and
HN-0-46 were used to this study. When the PDX volume
reached approximately 100 mm3, mice were randomly stratiﬁed into four groups and treated as follows: (i) vehicle,
(ii) PF-2341066, (iii) docetaxel or cisplatin, (iv) a combination of PF-2341066 and docetaxel or cisplatin. The treatments had no apparent toxicity as determined by body
weight change. PF-2341066 treatment effectively inhibited
tumor growth, whereas treatment with either docetaxel
alone or in combination with PF-2341066 showed stronger
tumor-inhibitory effects (Fig. 3A and B and Supplementary
Fig. S7A). Moreover, cisplatin treatment did not signiﬁcantly
reduce tumor volume in either HN-0-22 PDX or HN-0-29
PDX, whereas PF-2341066 treatment in combination with
cisplatin remarkably inhibited the tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. S8). To determine whether PF-2341066 treatment reduces the CSC population in PDXs, mice bearing
HN-0-22 PDX were sacriﬁced 7 days after the ﬁnal treatments to allow for the turnover of tumor cells in response to
treatment in vivo, and single cells dissociated from the treated tumors were assessed by sphere formation assay, ﬂow
cytometric analysis for CSC markers, and tumor-initiation
assay. Consistent with decreased CSCs, both sphere formation and the percentage of ALDHhigh cells were signiﬁcantly
decreased in HN-0-22 PDX treated with PF-2341066 alone or
in combination with docetaxel (Fig. 3C–F). Intriguingly,
docetaxel treatment alone increased the ability of sphere
formation and the percentage of ALDHhigh cells (Fig. 3C–F),
though the volume of HN-0-22 PDX was notably decreased,
providing further evidence that traditional chemotherapy
reduces tumor bulk without signiﬁcantly affecting CSCs.
Using tumor-initiating assays, we found that docetaxel-treated cells underwent increased tumor formation even at
lower cell concentrations compared with the vehicle-treated
cells, whereas PF-2341066–treated cells had reduced tumorinitiating capacity. Combined use of PF-2341066 and docetaxel almost completely eliminated secondary tumor formation for at least 16 weeks (Fig. 3G). The average CSC
frequency was low in the groups treated with PF-2341066
alone and in combination with docetaxel, but was signiﬁcantly increased in the docetaxel-treated tumors (Fig. 3G).
Similar results were observed for HN-0-29 PDX and HN-0-46

detected in seven HNSCC PDXs including three models
selected for this study, excluding the possibility that the
inhibitory effects of PF-2341066 are due to the inhibition of
ALK (Supplementary Fig. S9). These preclinical data show
that pharmacologic inhibition of c-Met can reduce CSCs in a
human HNSCC xenograft model to enhance the therapeutic
efﬁcacy of conventional anticancer drugs.

PF-2341066 completely suppressed the metastasis development of HN-CSC#2 sphere cells, whereas docetaxel treatment
only reduced the metastatic tumor burden without signiﬁcant
effect on the metastatic ability of HN-CSC#2 sphere cells, as
evidenced by the reduced luciferase signals within similar
metastatic spread sites (Fig. 4A). On the sixth week after cell
injection, the mice alive in docetaxel-treated group rapidly

measurable signals developed relatively slowly from the 6th
week to 10th week, suggesting that PF-2341066 treatment
effectively inhibited the development of metastasis. Intriguingly, the combined therapy completely prevented the metastasis in the period of observation. The luciferase images of a
representative mouse for each group at each time point was
shown in Fig. 4A. The vehicle-treated mice had a median
survival of 31 days after cell implantation, and although
docetaxel-treated mice showed prolonged survival, possibly
due to the reduced metastatic tumor burden, their median
survival remained limited to 55 days. In contrast, treatment
with PF-2341066 either alone or in combination with docetaxel
signiﬁcantly prolonged the survival (Fig. 4C). Similar results
were observed for mice injected with HN-CSC#3 sphere cells,
though the sites of the lesions differed according to different
patient-derived CSCs (Fig. 4D–F). It is worth noting that PF2341066 completely deprived the metastatic ability of HN-

Downregulation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling is a crucial
step for elimination of HN-CSCs induced by c-Met
inhibition
Recent studies have shown that developmental pathways,
such as Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog and TGFb, play important roles
in the self-renewal and maintenance of CSCs (14, 23, 29–31). To
understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact
of c-Met on HN-CSCs, we performed RT2 Proﬁler PCR Array to
assess the expression of 84 stem cell signaling–associated
genes in HN-CSC#1, HN-CSC#2, and HN-CSC#3 sphere cells
treated with or without 1 mmol/L PF-2341066. Intriguingly, the
Wnt/b-catenin cascade emerged as the most downregulated
canonical pathway following c-Met inhibition. As shown in

Supplementary Fig. S11A, PF-2341066 remarkably inhibited the
expression of many Wnt signaling molecules. To validate the
ﬁndings, we introduced a lentiviral TCF/LEF TOP-luciferase
reporter into HN-CSC#1 cells. Inhibition of c-Met with either
PF-2341066 (Fig. 5A) or its speciﬁc shRNA1 (Fig. 5H) reduced
the reporter activity. Knockdown of c-Met with shRNA1 lentivirus prevented the nuclear translocation of b-catenin (Fig.
5B) and substantially reduced the expression of nuclear b-catenin and the downstream effector LEF-1 (Fig. 5C). Similar
results were obtained with HN-CSC#2 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S12A, S12B, and S12F).
To test the role of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in c-Met–maintained HN-CSCs, we inhibited Wnt/b-catenin signaling by
introducing lentivirus expressing either Axin (32) or DKK-1

(33, 34) in HN-CSCs. Viable sphere cells were re-sorted 2 days
after infection and then grown in ultra-low attachment plates
for 11 days. Axin or DKK-1 overexpression in HN-CSC#1 cells
signiﬁcantly reduced the sphere formation (Fig. 5D) and
tumor-initiating ability (Supplementary Table S5). Furthermore, treatment with HGF (40 ng/mL), the only known ligand
of c-Met, enhanced self-renewal and tumor-initiating ability of
EV-overexpressed HN-CSC#1 cells, but failed to rescue these
properties in HN-CSC#1 cells with Axin or DKK-1 overexpression (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Table S5). Similar results were
obtained with HN-CSC#2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S12C;
Supplementary Table S5). These data suggest that elimination
of HN-CSCs by c-Met inhibition is due to the downregulation of
Wnt/b-catenin signaling.

FZD8 mediates the interaction of c-Met and Wnt/
b-catenin signaling in HN-CSCs
According to the RT2 Proﬁler PCR Array results, the expression of FZD8, one of the Wnt receptors, was most robustly
reduced following PF-2341066 treatment. To validate the
results, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was
performed to determine the expression of all Wnt receptors
using the same samples analyzed by PCR array. FZD8 was the
most consistently and prominently downregulated gene in PF2341066–treated CSCs (Supplementary Fig. S11B and S11C).
Interestingly, PF-2341066 reduced the expression of FZD8 in a
dose-dependent manner in HN-CSC#1 cells (Fig. 5E). Moreover,
HN-CSCs infected with c-Met shRNA1 lentivirus had lower
FZD8 expression than those infected with scramble shRNA
lentivirus (Fig. 5F and G and Supplementary Fig. S12D). We
excluded the possibility that FZD8 mutation is responsible for
elevated FZD8 activity in HN-CSCs, as exome sequencing did
not reveal associated FZD8 mutation in randomly selected 7
HNSCC specimens, and 9 HNSCC PDXs including three models
used in this study. These data suggest that the expression of
FZD8 is regulated by c-Met activity in HN-CSCs.
To determine whether the expression of FZD8 is necessary
for c-Met–mediated Wnt/b-catenin signaling in HN-CSCs,
we designed lentiviruses expressing FZD8 shRNAs or FZD8
cDNA. Among the three shRNAs tested, FZD8 shRNA1 had
the most marked knockdown effect (Supplementary Fig.
S12E). FZD8 shRNA1 infection in HN-CSC#1 sphere cells
signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of nuclear b-catenin and the
downstream effector LEF-1 (Fig. 5G). Importantly, stimulation with 40 ng/mL HGF increased Wnt/b-catenin luciferase
reporter activity; furthermore, infection with FZD8-shRNA1
largely reversed the stimulatory effect, while conversely,
FZD8 cDNA rescued the downregulated Wnt reporter activity caused by c-Met knockdown (Fig. 5H). Similar results
were obtained using HN-CSC#2 sphere cells (Supplementary
Fig. S12F). Immunochemistry staining further showed that
the activity of c-Met had a signiﬁcant positive correlation
with FZD8 and nuclear b-catenin expression in primary
HNSCC samples (Supplementary Fig. S12G).
Ectopic expression of FZD8 rescues the effects of c-Met
inhibition in HN-CSCs
To determine the function of FZD8 in c-Met regulation
of HN-CSCs, FZD8 was knocked down using shRNA1 lentivirus. FZD8 knockdown not only decreased the size and
number of spheres formed in primary, secondary, and tertiary sphere-forming assays (Fig. 6A and B), but also reduced
the tumor-initiating ability (Supplementary Table S6). To
conﬁrm that FZD8 mediates the effects of c-Met in HN-CSCs,
we examined whether ectopic expression of FZD8 rescues
the impaired CSC phenotype caused by c-Met inhibition. To
this end, HN-CSC#1 sphere cells were infected with lentivirus expressing FZD8 cDNA or empty vector (EV). As shown
in Fig. 6C, PF-2341066 treatment only weekly reduced the
sphere-forming ability of FZD8-overexpressed CSCs. FZD8
overexpression rescued c-Met shRNA1-induced impairment of sphere formation (Fig. 6D), tumor incidence (Supplementary Table S3), and orthotropic tumor growth (Fig. 6E

7554

Cancer Res; 74(24) December 15, 2014

and Supplementary Fig. S13A). Furthermore, PF-2341066
treatment did not deprive the FZD8-overexpressed HNCSC#1 cells of metastatic ability, as assessed by bioluminescence assays (Fig. 6F and Supplementary Fig. S13B). As
expected, FZD8 overexpression in HN-CSC#1 sphere cells
rescued their metastatic ability impaired by c-Met knockdown with speciﬁc shRNA1 (Fig. 6G and Supplementary
Fig. S13C). Together, these data suggest that c-Met inhibition eliminates HN-CSCs by signaling mechanisms that involve FZD8.
c-Met functionally regulates FZD8 through an
ERK/c-Fos cascade in HN-CSCs
To explore the mechanism of c-Met–mediated FZD8
expression in HN-CSCs, we ﬁrst examined whether HGFstimulated c-Met activation affects the expression of proteins involved in sphere formation. Treatment with HGF
signiﬁcantly increased the expression of FZD8 and b-catenin
(Supplementary Fig. S14A) and also upregulated the phosphorylation of c-Met, ERK1/2, and AKT in HN-CSC#1 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S14B). Intriguingly, HGF/c-Met–induced FZD8 expression in HN-CSC#1 cells was signiﬁcantly
inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, but not the PI3K
inhibitor Wortmannin (Supplementary Fig. S14C), suggesting that the ERK pathway is speciﬁcally involved in the
c-Met–mediated upregulation of FZD8 in HN-CSCs. We
speculated that c-Met may affect the transcription of FZD8.
Indeed, HGF signiﬁcantly increased the luciferase activity of
longer FZD8 promoters (700/þ1, 600/þ1 and 500/þ1),
but not a truncated form of the FZD8 promoter (400/þ1;
Fig. 7A and B), suggesting that the 500/400 region
is critical for HGF/c-Met–induced FZD8 transcription in
HN-CSCs. By analyzing the sequence of the FZD8 promoter
region (500/300), we identiﬁed a potential AP1-binding
site (Supplementary Fig. S15A). Mutation of the AP1-binding
site in the FZD8 promoter (Fig. 7C) abolished FZD8 luciferase activity (Fig. 7D) and c-Met–induced sphere formation
(Supplementary Fig. S15B), indicating that this binding site
has a functional role in HN-CSCs.
The inducible transcriptional complex AP1, composed of
FOS and JUN proteins, is crucial for the progression and
metastasis of HNSCC (35). Interestingly, knockdown of cFos, but not c-Jun, with shRNA lentivirus signiﬁcantly
inhibited the sphere-forming ability of HN-CSCs (Fig. 7E),
suggesting that c-Fos is required for c-Met–induced expression of FZD8 in HN-CSCs. To conﬁrm that c-Fos operates
downstream of c-Met in HN-CSCs, HN-CSC#1 cells were
treated with either PF-2341066 or HGF. Phospho-c-Fos was
downregulated in a dose-dependent manner, whereas total
c-Fos levels remained unchanged (Fig. 7F). As expected, HGF
stimulation increased the phosphorylation level of c-Fos
(Supplementary Fig. S14B). Moreover, c-Met-shRNA1 transfection decreased the expression of phospho-c-Fos in HNCSCs (Fig. 7G), verifying that c-Fos phosphorylation is
dependent on c-Met activity.
To test whether the activity of c-Met affects c-Fos binding to
the FZD8 promoter in HN-CSCs, we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Anti-c-Fos antibody, but

than the nonpromoter region of FZD8 gene (Fig. 7H and I).
Treatment with 40 ng/mL HGF increased the binding afﬁnity
between c-Fos and the FZD8 promoter, which was abolished by
inhibition of c-Met or EKR signaling (Fig. 7H and I). Functionally, treatment with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 diminished
the HGF-stimulated sphere formation in HN-CSC#1 cells by
targeting FZD8 expression (Supplementary Fig. S15C), and
ERK activation by ectopic expression of MEK1 in HN-CSC#1
cells rescued their decreased sphere formation caused by cMet knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S15D). These results
indicate that c-Met regulates FZD8 through an ERK/c-Fos
cascade in HN-CSCs (Supplementary Fig. S15E), and suggests
that targeting this pathway may provide a potentially effective
strategy to treat this deadly disease.

Discussion
We previously determined that c-Met could serve as a
novel marker for HN-CSCs (12). The current study demonstrates the indispensable role of the c-Met/FZD8 axis for the
maintenance of HN-CSCs. From a clinical standpoint, the cMet inhibitor PF-2341066 blocking the c-Met/FZD8 axis may
synergize with conventional chemotherapy to treat human
HNSCC, which suggests the potential therapeutic applicability of our ﬁndings.
Differential therapeutic effects between the c-Met inhibitor
PF-2341066 and the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel were
demonstrated in HNSCC PDXs, a model with signiﬁcant translational relevance (28). Docetaxel treatment induced more
measurable primary responses but led to higher tumor-initiating activity in the secondary mice. In contrast, PF-2341066

Targeting the c-Met/FZD8 Axis Eliminates HNCSCs

displayed modest initial tumor response rates but signiﬁcantly inhibited secondary tumor formation. This difference is
explained by the fact that PF-2341066 reduced the CSC population, whereas more CSCs were enriched following docetaxel
treatment, which could be explained by effects on either CSC
proliferation or differentiation. Although c-Met inhibition has
a therapeutic effect on PDXs by targeting CSCs, PF-2341066
alone is difﬁcult to achieve a full pharmacologic control in vivo,
most likely attributable to the detrimental effects of the high
tumor burden. Our current study demonstrated that combined
treatment with both PF-2341066 and docetaxel signiﬁcantly
inhibited the growth of PDXs by targeting CSCs and abrogating
the bulk of the tumors.
Although lymph node metastases are common in patients
with HNSCC, up to 25% of patients with HNSCC develop
distant metastasis to the lung, liver, bone, and muscle (36).
We and others have previously demonstrated that CSCs may
play an important role in HNSCC invasion and metastasis
(12, 37). To explore the effect of c-Met inhibition on the
formation of experimental metastasis, and also to address the
contribution of c-Met to HNSCC metastasis independent of
tumor growth, we established an animal metastatic model by
intracardiac injection of HN-CSCs. PF-2341066 treatment
remarkably deprived the metastatic ability of HN-CSCs, supporting the hypothesis that agents that target CSCs may be
more effective when administered as adjuvants rather than in
the advanced tumor setting (13). In contrast, treatment with
docetaxel alone only reduced the metastatic tumor burden,
with no signiﬁcant effect on the metastatic ability of CSCs.
Combined therapy with PF-2341066 and docetaxel almost
completely blocked the metastasis development for at least
12 weeks, further supporting the idea that a combination of cMet inhibitors and conventional chemotherapeutic drugs
could increase the chance to eradicate the CSC population in
HNSCC. Our data also suggest that c-Met inhibitor could be
administered in the adjuvant setting to prevent the outgrowth
of micrometastasis tumor from primary HNSCC that has been
removed surgically.
We determined that the activation of FZD8-mediated
Wnt/b-catenin signaling is a prerequisite for c-Met–maintained self-renewal. Many studies have described the interplay of c-Met and Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells (38, 39);
however, the mechanism is not fully understood, particularly
in the context of HN-CSCs. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of several FZD receptors, including
FZD2, FZD4, and FZD7, in different types of cancers (40–42).
The present study shows that FZD8 has a high expression in
HN-CSCs and is signiﬁcantly correlated with c-Met in
patients with HNSCC. FZD8 is activated by the addition of
the c-Met ligand, HGF, though c-Met can function in the
absence of exogenous HGF, which might be explained by
HGF-independent manner in HN-CSCs (data not shown). We
demonstrated that the inhibition of c-Met suppresses FZD8
in HN-CSCs, and FZD8 overexpression can rescue the effects
of c-Met inhibition on HN-CSCs in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that FZD8 is a crucial mediator for c-Met–maintained
HN-CSCs. Thus, our study provides mechanistic insight to
explain the role of the c-Met/FZD8 axis in the maintenance

www.aacrjournals.org

of HNSCC patient-derived CSCs, which has applicability in
the context of c-Met inhibition. Besides FZD8, many other
Wnt signaling genes were downregulated in our RT2 Proﬁler
PCR array in the presence of c-Met inhibitor, such as
b-catenin, LEF1, LRP6, TCF7, and other FZD proteins. The
identiﬁcation of b-catenin, which functions within the Wnt
pathway, but is not a Wnt target gene, is particularly
interesting and indicates that other mechanisms may regulate Wnt signaling.
C-Fos, a member of the FOS family of transcription factors,
associates with members of the JUN family of transcription
factors to form heterodimeric activator protein-1 (AP-1) complexes to transcriptionally regulate target gene expression (43,
44). Intriguingly, c-Fos binds to the promoter region of the
FZD8 gene in HN-CSCs, which is regulated by c-Met. Moreover,
knockdown of c-Fos, but not c-Jun, signiﬁcantly inhibits the
sphere-forming ability of HN-CSCs. These results suggest that
c-Fos is required for c-Met–induced expression of FZD8 in HNCSCs. As FOS proteins do not form homodimers and require
heterodimerization with JUN proteins to bind DNA (43, 44),
future work should investigate the precise mechanism by
which c-Fos binds to the FZD8 gene promoter region in
HN-CSCs.
In conclusion, we provide evidence that targeting the c-Met/
Fzd8 axis in HNSCC eliminates the CSC population and thus
inhibits the development and metastasis of HNSCC. Our study
suggests that treatment with c-Met antagonists alone or in
combination with the available chemotherapy regimens may
offer improved treatment to HNSCC.
