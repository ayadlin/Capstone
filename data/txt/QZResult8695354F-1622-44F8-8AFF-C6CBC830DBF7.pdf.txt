Targeted Therapies in Squamous Cell
Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
Kathryn A. Gold, Ho-Young Lee, PhD, and Edward S. Kim, MD

Head and neck cancer is a challenging disease that is expected to account for greater than 500,000 new
cases worldwide in 2008. Toxicity has impeded advances in chemotherapy and radiation for head and neck
cancer, and the prognosis for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic disease remains poor. Over the
past decade, clinical research in head and neck cancer has focused on improving the efficacy of current
multimodal approaches by targeting cellular pathways associated with carcinogenesis. Blocking the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) have
emerged as primary strategies that account for the success of current targeted therapies in cancer. Recent
studies with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the EGFR, have demonstrated survival benefits
across the range of treatment settings in advanced head and neck cancer, and it is the only targeted therapy approved for use in this malignancy. In this review, the authors present the current development status
of targeted therapies, focusing on those that have potential to impact the management of head and neck
cancer in the near-term future. Trials are ongoing in all stages of disease and with a variety of modalities
and agents, and those trials should provide critical insight into the best way to use these agents to improve

Despite advances in local and systemic therapy, head and neck cancer remains a clinically challenging
disease. For the past decade, clinical research in head and neck cancer has focused on improving on the
benefits of chemotherapy and radiation by targeting the cellular pathways associated with carcinogenesis.
Recent studies with cetuximab (Erbitux; ImClone Systems Inc., New York, NY/Bristol-Myers Squibb,
New York, NY), a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), have demonstrated survival benefits across the range of treatment settings in advanced head and
neck cancer. Cetuximab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006, making
it the first and, currently, the only targeted biologic available for commercial use in head and neck cancer.
Other compounds that target EGFR along with novel compounds that target other cellular domains
that have been implicated in carcinogenesis remain under active clinical investigation in head and neck
cancer. In this review, we present the current development status of these targeted therapies, focusing on
those that are in the later stages of clinical development.

or adjunct (recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN) to conventional chemotherapeutics.

Natural History of Head and Neck Cancer
Head and neck cancers are a biologically similar group of
epithelial cancers that occur throughout the upper aerodigestive tract. The majority (90%-95%) are squamous cell
carcinoma (SCCHN), and their different primary sites
amid the complex anatomy of the head and neck give rise
to intricate patterns of local invasion and regional spread
that make treatment choices complicated. This distinction
also makes primary tumors more difficult to eradicate
once they have grown large enough to spread into adjacent
tissues and lymph nodes. Primary tumor sites include the
lip, oral cavity (mouth), nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses,
pharynx, and larynx. The pharynx, larynx, mouth, and
tongue each account for approximately 10,000 new cases
in the US annually.1
Overall, a cure is achieved in approximately 50% of
all patients with SCCHN. Approximately 33% of patients
present with early-stage disease (stages I and II) and have a
5-year survival rate of approximately 80%, another 50%
of patients have locally advanced (LA) disease (stages IIIIVB) and have a 5-year survival rate of approximately
50%, and 10% of patients have metastatic (stage IVC)
disease with only approximately 25% surviving past 5
years1 (Table 1).
In contrast to many other cancers in which metastasis is the primary cause of death, local recurrence is the
most common cause of treatment failure and death in
patients with head and neck cancers. Greater than 50% of
patients who die from head and neck cancer have locoCancer

regional disease as the only site of failure, and nearly 90%
of patients with distant failure also have persistent locoregional disease.2 Because of the frequency of local recurrence, locoregional control is a key treatment objective,
and localized treatment with radiotherapy and/or surgery
is a critical component of initial management. The 50%
of patients who develop recurrent disease have a very poor
prognosis, with a median overall survival (OS) of only 6
to 9 months, and <33% remain alive at 1 year.3 Patients
with recurrent and/or metastatic (RM) disease who
progress after treatment have the worst prognosis, with a
median OS of 3 to 4 months, and <5% remain alive at
1 year.4
Risk factors for SCCHN include cigarette, cigar, or
pipe smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.5 More
recently, it was demonstrated that human papillomavirus
(HPV), especially HPV type 16, plays a role in the pathogenesis of a subset of SCCHNs.6 HPV-associated cancers
are distinct epidemiologically, clinically, and molecularly
from HPV-negative tumors and are associated with
improved survival outcomes.7,8
It is believed that epithelial cancers such as SCCHN
develop from a series of genetic events that affect key molecules and biologic pathways.9 The expression of biologic
markers is associated with ‘early’ events in premalignant
lesions. These biomarkers of cancer progression include
mutations in the ras and Bcl-2 proto-oncogenes, inactivation of the tumor-suppressor genes (eg, p53), and
increased expression of the receptors involved in growth

and differentiation, such as EGFR and the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR).
Accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities, oncogene
activation, and differences in genetic susceptibility all
likely influence the prognosis for neoplastic tissues and
provide the scientific basis for biologically based anticancer strategies. Two primary strategies have emerged
that account for most of the success of current targeted
therapies: 1) blocking growth factor-based cellular signaling (eg, EGFR-associated) and 2) blocking angiogenesis-related cellular signaling (eg, VEGFR-associated).
Although many other biologic strategies continue to be
studied, most late-stage clinical trials are testing agents
that have activity related to either or both of these 2
strategies.

Current Treatment of Head and
Neck Cancer
SCCHN falls into 4 stages: 1) early-stage disease, 2) LA
disease, 3) RM disease, and 4) platinum-refractory disease
(Table 1). Cure is the primary objective of the initial therapeutic approach for patients who are diagnosed without
distant metastases. For patients with early-stage SCCHN
(stage I and most stage II), this objective is achieved readily with single-modality radiotherapy and/or surgery. For
LA SCCHN (stages III-IVB), which tends to be highly
sensitive to initial treatment strategies, a combination of
local therapy (radiotherapy and/or surgery) and systemic
chemotherapy usually is used. Accordingly, combinedmodality therapy (ie, induction and/or concurrent) has
emerged over the last decade as the standard therapy for
LA SCCHN.2 Finally, the goal of therapy for patients
with RM SCCHN is palliation. These patients generally
are treated with chemotherapy alone, beginning with a
platinum singlet or a platinum-based doublet, then proceeding to a variety of single agents upon platinum
failure.
Although the treatment of SCCHN remains multidisciplinary, it continues to evolve, and much clinical
research has focused on the ability of nonsurgical
approaches to obviate surgery. Multiple clinical trials
have demonstrated the ability of concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) to improve survival while preserving organ
function,2 although the significant late toxicities of CRT
may outweigh its potential benefits in many patients.
924

Three general approaches to CRT currently are used: 1)
surgery followed by adjuvant CRT, 2) definitive CRT
with surgery as an optional salvage or completion treatment, and 3) induction chemotherapy followed by definitive CRT. The induction approach is of increasing
interest, because it has the theoretical potential to
decrease the risk of distant failure, may rapidly reduce
tumor bulk, and may predict responsiveness to CRT.
Phase 2 studies have yielded encouraging results, and
the induction approach is the subject of several large
randomized trials.10,11
Despite much progress, toxicity has impeded advances with current approaches. Standard CRT is associated
with substantial toxicity, and efforts to improve its therapeutic index through increased exposure to chemotherapy
and/or radiation generally have not succeeded. Furthermore, although chemotherapy provides some benefit to
patients with RM SCCHN, their prognosis remains poor.
Additional treatment options are needed desperately for
these patients.
For these reasons, targeted agents have been the subject of great clinical interest. The results of recent phase 3
trials have confirmed these benefits for the anti-EGFR
MoAb cetuximab. However, results to date have demonstrated weak activity with these agents as monotherapies,
suggesting that combinations of targeted agents and conventional therapy will be necessary to achieve improved
outcomes. It is noteworthy that the necessity of combining local and systemic therapy in LA SCCHN results in a
level of complexity that makes performing and interpreting clinical trials very difficult. In addition, clinical trials
are testing cytotoxics, notably docetaxel and pemetrexed,
with promising results. Ongoing trials should provide
critical insight into the best ways to combine agents and
modalities to improve outcomes further in patients with
SCCHN.

motility, adhesion, invasion, induction of angiogenesis,
and inhibition of apoptosis.13 The overexpression of
EGFR has been documented in several malignancies,
including SCCHN, in which its overexpression consistently is high (>90%).13,14 Studies of tissue samples
from patients with SCCHN have indicated that the
expression of EGFR is higher in tumor tissue versus normal tissue15-17 and that increased levels of EGFR and its
ligand transforming growth factor a are strong predictors
of decreased disease-free survival.18
Given the apparent role of EGFR in tumorigenesis
and the high degree to which it appears to be overexpressed in SCCHN, blockade of EGFR pathways has
been investigated as a rational anticancer strategy.19 The

weight tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib (Iressa;

inhibit both EGFR and HER-2 (erbB-2) also are undergoing clinical trials in SCCHN. Of these, lapatinib
(Tykerb; GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, Pa) is furthest
along in clinical development (Table 2). Recent research
has demonstrated that the cancer-specific mutant EGFR
VIII may occur in >33% of SCCHN and, thus, may provide a promising target for therapy.20 An anti-EGFR VIII
vaccine (CDX-110) is undergoing phase 3 testing in
glioblastoma multiforme; whether this vaccine or EGFR
VIII-specific MoAbs could be effective in treating
SCCHN is unknown.

Cetuximab

Cetuximab is a human:murine MoAb of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype that appears to act through
multiple mechanisms; and, as an anti-EGFR MoAb,
cetuximab blocks the binding of natural ligands to the
EGFR, preventing EGFR dimerization, internalization,
and autophosphorylation and inhibiting subsequent activation of tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways.
Preclinical studies demonstrated that cetuximab inhibited
the growth of EGFR-expressing carcinoma cell lines
through cell cycle arrest, antiangiogenesis, antiapoptosis,
and inhibition of tumor cell invasion and metastasis.21-23
More recent data demonstrated that cetuximab may block
the nuclear import of EGFR, preventing activation of
DNA repair mechanisms that protect cells from radiationor chemotherapy-induced DNA damage.24 This finding
is consistent with animal studies, which demonstrated
that cetuximab augments the antitumor effects of both
radiotherapy25,26 and conventional chemotherapeutics.27,28 Cetuximab also may engage host-immune
functions, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity,
which are associated specifically with the IgG1 isotype.29
On the basis of the promising results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials, cetuximab has been
studied across the continuum of advanced SCCHN. To
our knowledge, 2 large phase 3 trials, 1 each in LA disease
and RM disease, and 11 phase 2 studies have been completed. One large phase 3 trial in LA SCCHN is ongoing
as well as numerous phase 2 studies, including 3 trials that
have enrolled >400 patients with LA laryngeal cancer to
specifically study the potential role of cetuximab therapy
in achieving larynx preservation. The FDA has approved
2 indications for cetuximab in SCCHN: 1) in combination with radiotherapy in patients with LA or regionally
advanced SCCHN and 2) as monotherapy in patients
with RM SCCHN for whom prior platinum-based therapy has failed.
Locally advanced SCCHN

The LA SCCHN indication for cetuximab is based
on a multinational, randomized phase 3 study comparing
radiotherapy plus cetuximab with radiotherapy alone in
the treatment of LA SCCHN.30 Patients were randomized to receive high-dose radiotherapy plus cetuximab (n
¼ 211 patients) or high-dose radiotherapy alone (n ¼ 213
926

patients). In the radiotherapy plus cetuximab group,
cetuximab therapy consisted of 8 total doses initiated 1
week before radiotherapy at a loading dose of 400 mg/m2
over a period of 120 minutes followed by weekly
60-minute infusions of 250 mg/m2 for the duration of
radiotherapy.
The results demonstrated that adding cetuximab to
radiotherapy significantly prolonged both locoregional
control and OS compared with radiotherapy alone. There
was a 32% reduction in the risk of locoregional failure
(hazards ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 0.52-0.89 [P ¼ .005]), resulting in a nearly 10month increase in median locoregional control with the
addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy (24.4 months vs
14.9 months). There was a 26% reduction in the risk of
death (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.57-0.97 [P ¼ .03]), resulting
in a nearly 20-month increase in median OS with the
addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy (49 months vs 29.3
months). To our knowledge, this improvement in OS is
the highest yet reported in a phase 3 trial in this setting.
Preservation of function also appeared to be improved
with cetuximab. Although the trial was not powered to
detect significance for this outcome, patients who received
cetuximab plus radiotherapy had a 49% reduction in the
risk of undergoing laryngectomy and a rate of larynx preservation nearly double that of the patients who received
radiotherapy alone (15.4% vs 8.6%). With the exception
of the expected cetuximab-related toxicities of acneiform
rash and infusion-related events, the incidence of severe
(grade 3-5) reactions was similar in the 2 treatment
groups. It is noteworthy that the clinical benefits of adding cetuximab to radiotherapy were achieved without
adversely affecting quality of life (QoL).31 On the basis of
these results, cetuximab plus radiotherapy has become a
valuable therapeutic option and a foundation for further
clinical research in patients with LA SCCHN.
Single-arm studies of cetuximab plus CRT in LA
SCCHN have produced encouraging efficacy with possibly higher toxicity than what was observed with CRT
alone. A large phase 3 study, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0522 (NCT00265941), currently is
ongoing to test this strategy (Table 3).32-34 Patients in
RTOG 0522 are being randomized to treatment with
concurrent boost radiotherapy (1.8 grays [Gy] per day
during Weeks 1-6; a boost of 1.6 Gy 4-6 hours later during Weeks 5 and 6; 70 Gy total to macroscopic disease)

Building on the results of earlier studies,35,36 the
Erbitux in First-Line Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer or ‘EXTREME’ study confirmed the benefit of adding cetuximab to chemotherapy
in patients with previously untreated (first-line) RM
SCCHN.37,38 To our knowledge, this phase 3 trial is the
first in this setting in >25 years to yield significantly
improved survival compared with standard platinumbased chemotherapy alone. In total, 442 patients with
RM SCCHN who were not amenable to local therapy
and had not received systemic therapy in this disease setting were randomized to treatment with either cetuximab
plus platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]; n ¼ 222 patients) or platinum-based chemotherapy alone (n ¼ 220 patients).
Patients received cetuximab at a dose of 400 mg/m2 followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly until progression or unacceptable toxicity and either carboplatin (area under the
serum concentration-time curve, 5; Day 1) or cisplatin
(100 mg/m2 intravenously; Day 1) plus 5-FU (1000 mg/

response rate (ORR). The addition of cetuximab to platinum-based chemotherapy reduced the overall risk of
death by 20% (HR, 0.797; 95% CI, 0.644-0.986 [P ¼
.036]) and prolonged the median OS by 36.5% or 2.7
months (10.1 months vs 7.4 months). The risk of disease
progression was reduced by 46% (HR, 0.538; 95% CI,
0.431-0.672 [P < .0001]), and the median PFS was
prolonged by 70% or 2.3 months (5.6 months vs 3.3
months). The ORR was increased by 83% (35.6% vs
19.5%; P ¼ .0001). These substantial clinical benefits
were achieved with no decrease in QoL associated with
the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy. Grade 3 and
4 adverse events were similar between the study arms, and
acne-like rash and infusion reactions were limited to the
patients who received cetuximab. The prolonged survival
and acceptable safety profile demonstrated in the trial
make cetuximab plus platinum-based chemotherapy an
important treatment option for these patients and suggest
that cetuximab added to platinum-based chemotherapy
may represent a new standard of care in the first-line
treatment of patients with RM SCCHN.
Platinum-refractory SCCHN

Having failed standard earlier line therapies, patients
with platinum-refractory disease have few good treatment
options; therefore, most novel therapies for SCCHN are
tested first in this setting. Although there is no recognized
standard treatment, cetuximab monotherapy is the only
therapy with an approved indication for platinum-refractory SCCHN. Three large, single-arm, phase 2 trials have
been reported testing cetuximab as monotherapy and
in combination with platinum chemotherapy in this
927

Review Article

setting.39-41 For comparable groups of patients, these
studies have reported an OS of approximately 6 months
that compared favorably to the 3.6 months observed in a
historic control group of 151 patients.4 It is worth noting
that the results for cetuximab monotherapy41 and cetuximab plus cisplatin39 were similar, suggesting that there
may be little advantage to combining the 2 agents. Grade
3 and 4 adverse events generally were similar across the 3
trials and were consistent with the toxicity profiles of the
individual agents.
In summary, a large body of clinical trial evidence
confirms the benefits of incorporating cetuximab into
therapy across the treatment spectrum of advanced
SCCHN (Table 3). Adverse effects are predictable and
manageable, consisting primarily of rash and infusion
reactions, and do not appear to exacerbate the toxicities of
chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although it is unclear
how this finding may impact clinical use of cetuximab,
Chung et al recently demonstrated an association between
geographic variations in the frequency of infusion reactions and preexisting IgE antibodies to galactose-a-1,3galactose that cross-react with cetuximab.42
Further elucidation of the role of cetuximab in the
management of SCCHN awaits the completion of
ongoing trials that are addressing its use as an addition to
standard CRT and induction regimens, as a component
of adjuvant and neoadjuvant approaches, and as a foundation for targeted agent combinations that might eliminate
or reduce the use of conventional chemotherapy. It is
noteworthy that the substantial clinical experience with
cetuximab in SCCHN also provides a benchmark against
which to compare other novel biologics that are being
tested in this disease.
Other anti–EGFR MoAbs

Two other anti-EGFR MoAbs, panitumumab (Vectibix, Amgen) and zalutumumab (HuMax-EGFr; GenMab MN Inc., Brooklyn Park, Minn), are being tested in
late-stage clinical trials (Tables 2 and 4), whereas the development of a fourth such antibody, matuzumab (EMD
72,000), has been discontinued. Both panitumumab and
zalutumumab are fully human MoAbs that, similar to
cetuximab, bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR.
The ongoing trials with these MoAbs should answer the
question of whether either provides a clinical advantage
over cetuximab in SCCHN.
928

Panitumumab is the subject of 2 randomized trials
each in LA SCCHN and RM SCCHN (Table 4). In the
LA setting, the phase 2 Radiotherapy Plus Panitumumab
Compared to Chemoradiotherapy With Unresected,
Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head
and Neck or ‘CONCERT2’ trial (National Clinical Trials
[NCT] no. NCT00547157) will evaluate 150 treatmentnaive patients for locoregional control after treatment
with either standard CRT (radiotherapy plus cisplatin) or
radiotherapy plus panitumumab.34 In a complementary
phase 2 trial (NCT00500760), 150 treatment-naive
patients are being randomized to receive standard CRT
with or without panitumumab, again with locoregional
control as the primary endpoint.34 In RM SCCHN, the
phase 3 Study of Panitumumab Efficacy in Patients with
Recurrent and/or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer or
‘SPECTRUM’ trial (NCT00460265) is randomizing 650
treatment-naive patients to cisplatin/5-FU with or without panitumumab, with OS as the primary endpoint.34 A

Head and Neck Cancer Evaluation of Response or
‘PARTNER’ trial (NCT00454779) in which 110 treatment-naive patients are being randomized to receive

PFS is the primary endpoint of that trial.
Zalutumumab is the subject of 2 large phase 3 trials,
1 in LA SCCHN and the other in the platinum-refractory
setting (Table 4). The Danish Head and Neck Cancer
Group recently initiated an open-label phase 3 trial
(NCT00496652) that will assess locoregional control and

Review Article

primarily as monotherapy, to our knowledge, neither has
met a primary endpoint in a late-stage clinical trial in this
disease to date. For example, in the recently reported
phase 3 Iressa Versus Methotrexate or ‘IMEX’ trial, which
randomized 486 patients with refractory SCCHN to
receive gefitinib versus methotrexate, no difference in OS,
the primary endpoint of the trial, was observed. The median OS was 5.6 months, 6 months, and 6.7 months; and
the 1-year survival rates were 16.7%, 17.8%, and 26.5%,
for the gefitinib at 250 mg, gefitinib at 500 mg, and methotrexate comparator arms, respectively.43 Despite disappointing results, these agents are being tested in several
ongoing trials that may help delineate roles for them in
the management of SCCHN (Table 4).
Both agents are being studied in early-stage as well
as advanced disease. In the only late-stage prevention trial
ongoing in SCCHN (NCT00402779), the ability of erlotinib monotherapy to reduce the incidence of oral cancer
is being studied in the high-risk setting of oral leukoplakia
with loss of heterozygosity in the intraepithelial neoplasia
of patients with a history of curatively treated oral cancer
and in patients with no history of oral cancer.34 Correlative analyses of this trial likely will provide an improved
understanding of the role of EGFR and other biologic factors in the early pathogenesis of SCCHN. In the adjuvant
setting, in what to our knowledge is 1 of the few trials
testing maintenance therapy in the curative setting
(NCT00412217), 300 patients at high risk for recurrence
after surgery will receive erlotinib monotherapy versus
standard-of-care therapy, with PFS as the primary endpoint.34 A similar population of 140 high-risk patients is
being randomized to postoperative CRT with or without
gefitinib in the phase 2 Postoperative Radiotherapy with
Cisplatin Alone or in Combination With Iressa in Upper
Aerodigestive Tract Carcinomas or ‘CARISSA’ trial
(NCT00169221).34
In advanced SCCHN, a phase 2 study
(NCT00410826) is randomizing 204 patients with LA
SCCHN to CRT with or without erlotinib, with complete response as the primary endpoint.34 In the refractory
setting, a phase 3 trial is assessing the OS of 330 patients
randomized to docetaxel with or without gefitinib. Kim et
al recently reported the results of a single-arm phase 2
study in patients with RM SCCHN who were treated
with the combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and erlotinib. Among the 47 patients now evaluable for efficacy,
930

there is a response rate of >60%, and the median OS and
PFS are 11 months and 6 months, respectively.44 These
encouraging results suggest the potential of combining a
taxane, cisplatin, and an anti-EGFR agent in the RM
setting.
Dual kinase inhibitors

It is believed that EGFR/HER-2 heterodimers may
potentiate receptor signaling and resistance to EGFR
inhibitors. Lapatinib (Tykerb; GlaxoSmithKline), a dual
kinase inhibitor that targets both EGFR and HER-2 and
may block dimerization, has been tested in SCCHN and
reportedly has a favorable safety profile but little activity
as a single agent in RM SCCHN.45 Currently, this agent
is being evaluated in a phase 3 trial (NCT00424255) as
adjuvant therapy in combination with CRT in almost
700 patients with high-risk LA SCCHN and in a randomized phase 2 trial (NCT00387127), also in combination
with radiotherapy and cisplatin, in 100 patients with LA
SCCHN.34 Another trial (NCT00498953) in 133
patients with LA SCCHN of the larynx and hypopharynx
(N ¼ 133 patients) is testing lapatinib in an induction
model with combination chemotherapy (docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU) followed by CRT with or without lapatinib,
with organ preservation as the primary endpoint.34
Another dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER-2,
BIBW 2992, may hold promise for activity against tumors
resistant to other EGFR inhibitors because of its potent
and irreversible binding of EGFR and HER-2. This agent
is being studied in 80 patients in a randomized phase 2
trial (NCT00514943) comparing it with cetuximab in
patients who have refractory SCCHN.34
Targeting Angiogenesis
Angiogenesis is required for tumor progression and metastasis, and inhibiting this process by blocking the proangiogenic factor VEGF and its receptors (VEFGR) has
become an intensive focus of clinical investigation. VEGF
expression is up-regulated in many tumors, favoring tumor vascularization and growth.46-48 Many ongoing trials
are testing the potential role of angiogenesis inhibitors in
SCCHN in combination with conventional approaches
and with other targeted agents.
The most well developed angiogenesis inhibitor, the
anti-VEFG MoAb bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech),
Cancer

Targeted Therapies for SCCHN/Gold et al

has FDA-approved indications in advanced colorectal,
lung, and breast cancer and is in late-stage development in
SCCHN. In an ongoing phase 3 trial conducted by
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
(NCT00588770), 400 patients with treatment-naive RM
SCCHN are being randomized to docetaxel/cisplatin/5FU with or without bevacizumab, with OS as the primary
endpoint.34 In LA SCCHN, bevacizumab is being tested
in a phase 2 trial (NCT00703976) randomizing 80
patients to radiotherapy/pemetrexed/cetuximab with or
without bevacizumab, with PFS as the primary
endpoint.34
Cediranib (Recentin; AstraZeneca), an oral, highly
potent, and selective VEGF signaling inhibitor of all 3
VEGFRs, has demonstrated activity across a broad range
of solid tumors and currently is in late-stage development
for colorectal and ovarian cancers. Cediranib is being
tested in the RM SCCHN setting as a monotherapy in a
single-arm phase 2 trial (NCT00458978), with the overall
response rate as the primary endpoint.34
Preclinical and early clinical evidence suggests that
combining anti-EGFR and antiangiogenesis may provide
a more active cancer treatment than either strategy alone.
It has been demonstrated that EGFR activation up-regulates VEGF, which, in turn, has been correlated with
resistance to anti-EGFR agents.49 In addition, in vitro
studies have demonstrated that the dual inhibition of
VEGFR and EGFR increases apoptosis, decreases cell
proliferation and vascular permeability, and improves
cytostatic activity.50 In a phase 1/2 study, Vokes et al combined erlotinib with escalating doses of bevacizumab
(maximum, 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in patients with refractory SCCHN (n ¼ 48 patients; phase 2 cohort).51
With the highest dose of bevacizumab, 14% of patients
achieved an objective response, and 54% had stable disease. The median PFS and OS were 3.8 months and 6.8
months, respectively. Several additional early-stage clinical trials are ongoing that are testing combinations of
angiogenesis and EGFR inhibitors in SCCHN, primarily
in the RM setting.

Multitargeted kinase inhibitors

Several novel oral agents are in clinical development
that affect multiple pathways and may provide a simpler
approach to blocking multiple targets. These agents
Cancer

March 1, 2009

include the oral kinase inhibitors sorafenib, sunitinib, and
vandetanib.
Sorafenib (Nexavar; Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Emeryville, Calif/Bayer Healthcare, Morristown, NJ) is an oral
kinase inhibitor that has been approved for metastatic
renal cell carcinoma and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. It affects multiple signaling pathways that are
associated with tumor angiogenesis and cell growth and
proliferation and inhibits the activity of VEGFR and the
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) as well
as the RAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
pathway. Promising early clinical results were obtained in
RM SCCHN with sorafenib monotherapy in treatmentnaive patients, yielding a median OS and time to progression of 8 months and 4 months, respectively.52 A nonrandomized phase 2 trial (NCT00494182) in a similar
RM SCCHN patient population currently is evaluating
the efficacy and safety of the combination of paclitaxel,
carboplatin, and sorafenib.34
Sunitinib (Sutent; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY),
which is approved by the FDA for renal cell carcinoma, is
an oral inhibitor of several receptor tyrosine kinases,
including b-Raf and c-Raf kinase, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3,
and PDGFR-b. By inhibiting the activity of these receptors, it is believed that sunitinib, such as sorafenib, exerts
anticancer effects through the inhibition of both angiogenesis and cell proliferation. Sunitinib monotherapy currently is being tested in a 37-patient, single-arm, phase 2
study (NCT00408252) in refractory SCCHN.34
Vandetanib (Zactima; AstraZeneca) is a selective
dual inhibitor of the EGFR and VEGF pathways. It is
being studied in combination with docetaxel in a 72patient, randomized, phase 2 trial (NCT00459043) in
refractory SCCHN.34

Other Potential Targets
Insulin growth factor type-1 receptor

The insulin growth factor type-1 receptor (IGF-1R)
is widely over expressed on human epithelial tumors.53,54
Binding of its ligand IGF stimulates signaling cascades
that include the insulin receptor substrate 1/phosphoinositide 3 kinase/AKT (protein kinase B)/mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2/son of sevenless/Ras/mitogenactivated protein kinase pathway, and preclinical studies
931

Review Article

have demonstrated that blockade of IGF-1R causes apoptosis of tumor cells, inhibits tumorigenesis, and prevents
tumor invasion and metastasis.53
Interactions between different families of receptors
may be integral to the regulation of their signaling in normal tissue and cancer tissue.55 For example, IGF-1R and
EGFR heterodimers activate IGF-1R and its downstream
mediators, in turn stimulating mTOR-mediated de novo
EGFR synthesis and antiapoptotic survivin proteins,
thereby promoting resistance to erlotinib.56,57 In this
model, the inactivation of IGF-1R increases sensitivity to
erlotinib. Through similar mechanisms, gefitinib appears
to inhibit nonsmall cell lung cancer cell proliferation and
induces apoptosis when IGF-IR signaling is suppressed,
suggesting that combined targeting of IGF-1R and EGFR
may be effective in enhancing antitumor activity.58
The MoAb IMC-A12 (ImClone Systems) is the
only IGF-1R inhibitor currently undergoing clinical
testing in SCCHN. In a randomized phase 2 trial
(NCT00617734) that addresses the potentially important
interactions described above, IMC-A12 is being evaluated
as a single agent and in combination with cetuximab in
patients with refractory SCCHN.34 Up to 90 patients will
be enrolled in the study, and PFS will be the primary
endpoint.
SRC Family Kinases

Src kinases are involved in the regulation of a variety
of normal cellular signal transduction pathways. Increased
Src activity up-regulates several signaling cascades associated with tumor development and progression, leading to
increased cell growth, migration, and invasion. The levels
of Src expression or activation in epithelial tumors generally correlate with disease progression.59 Several agents
with Src kinase inhibitory activity, including the oral
agents dasatinib and AZD0530, are in phase 2 development (Table 2).
Dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a
potent inhibitor of multiple oncogenic kinases—BCRABL, SRC, cKIT, PDGFR, and ephrin A—and is the furthest advanced of the agents targeting Src kinases in clinical development. Because of its ability to inhibit BCRABL, dasatinib initially was developed in leukemia, for
which it was approved by the FDA in 2006. Because dasatinib has demonstrated in vitro activity against cells that
are resistant to EGFR inhibition, it is of considerable in932

terest in SCCHN and other tumor types in which antiEGFR agents are active.60 The agent currently is in clinical testing for many solid tumors, including SCCHN, in
which it is being evaluated in 2 single-arm phase 2 trials in
the RM setting.
Proteasome

The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex that plays a critical role in the intracellular degradation of proteins responsible for regulated cell growth.61,62
In preclinical cancer models, proteasome inhibitors have
demonstrated antitumor effects associated with the induction of apoptosis and the sensitization of malignant cells
and tumors to the proapoptotic effects of conventional
cytotoxics and radiation therapy.61,62 This preclinical activity has been translated successfully to the clinic with the
injectable small-molecule proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge,
Mass). Currently approved for treating recurrent multiple
myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, bortezomib is being
tested in numerous clinical trials in solid tumors. In a
randomized phase 2 ECOG trial (NCT00103259), 102
patients with RM SCCHN are being randomized to
bortezomib with or without irinotecan, with objective
response as the primary endpoint.34 Bortezomib also is
being studied in single-arm phase 2 trials in SCCHN in
combination with docetaxel and with cetuximab and
radiation.
p53

The tumor-suppressor gene p53 plays a crucial role
in cell cycle control and apoptosis in response to foreign
DNA synthesis, and its dysfunction has been implicated
as a causative factor in many cancers. Mutations of p53
have been identified in 43% of invasive SCCHNs,63 and
their frequency is increased when there is a history of
tobacco use, with or without alcohol consumption.64
Novel p53-targeted approaches that have been investigated in SCCHN include ONYX-015, which is no longer
under development, and INGN 201.
INGN 201 (Ad-p53; Advexin) is a gene therapy in
which a replication-defective adenovirus serotype 5 vector
with a p53 combinational DNA insertion is administered
directly into the tumor to replace mutated p53 genes with
wild-type (normal) p53 genes. A phase 3 trial in refractory
SCCHN has been completed, and a phase 3 trial in RM

SCCHN is ongoing. On the basis of completed phase 3
results, which are not yet published, application for
approval of INGN 201 as monotherapy for refractory
SCCHN was filed with the FDA and the European Medical Evaluation Agency (EMEA) (Table 4). In practice, the
logistical issues associated with ensuring effective intratumoral administration of this type of therapy may limit its
feasibility. Should either the FDA or EMEA application
be approved, INGN 201 would be the first gene therapy
approved by a regulatory agency for any indication.

combined with the rich pipeline of ongoing clinical trials,
promise advances in the near future that should further
improve the benefits of therapy for patients with
SCCHN.

DISCUSSION
In summary, 1 targeted agent, the anti-EGFR MoAb
cetuximab, has been approved for commercial use in
SCCHN, and several others are in late-stage clinical trials.
The majority of the latter include compounds that target
EGFR and others directed against angiogenesis targets as
well as many that are active against multiple targets that
are involved in both tumor proliferation and angiogenesis.
Additional novel compounds under investigation in
SCCHN include the p53 gene therapy INGN 201, the
anti-IGF-1R MoAb IMC-A12, and bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor. Many of these agents have proven anticancer efficacy and safety, with approved indications in
other tumor types. Whether similar benefits will be
observed in SCCHN awaits the results of ongoing trials.
By demonstrating improved survival across the
treatment spectrum of advanced SCCHN, cetuximab has
proven the targeted therapy paradigm in this disease.
Ongoing clinical trials will define further the role of cetuximab in the management of patients with SCCHN. In
addition to serving as a benchmark against which to measure the clinical trial results of other targeted agents in
SCCHN, cetuximab also may provide a good foundation
upon which to build rational biologic combination therapies that potentially may obviate or reduce the need for
conventional cytotoxics. Indeed, although they were not
covered in this review, there are many early-stage clinical
trials that are exploring this biologic combination
approach. Finally, as in other tumor types, there is great
interest in SCCHN for identifying potential biomarkers
that are predictive of treatment outcomes. This is an area
of active research in SCCHN that eventually could
improve risk:benefit and cost:benefit ratios through a personalized medicine approach to therapy. These efforts,
