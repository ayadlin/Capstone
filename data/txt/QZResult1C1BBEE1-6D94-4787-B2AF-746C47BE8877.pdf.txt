Abstract
There is an urgent need for better therapeutic options for advanced melanoma
patients, particularly those without the BRAFV600E/K mutation. In melanoma cells, loss
of TRIM16 expression is a marker of cell migration and metastasis, while the BRAF
inhibitor, vemurafenib, induces melanoma cell growth arrest in a TRIM16-dependent
manner. Here we identify a novel small molecule compound which sensitized BRAF
wild-type melanoma cells to vemurafenib. High throughput, cell-based, chemical
library screening identified a compound (C012) which significantly reduced melanoma
cell viability, with limited toxicity for normal human fibroblasts. When combined with
the BRAFV600E/K inhibitor, vemurafenib, C012 synergistically increased vemurafenib
potency in 5 BRAFWT and 4 out of 5 BRAFV600E human melanoma cell lines (Combination
Index: CI < 1), and, dramatically reduced colony forming ability. In addition, this drug
combination was significantly anti-tumorigenic in vivo in a melanoma xenograft mouse
model. The combination of vemurafenib and C012 markedly increased expression
of TRIM16 protein, and knockdown of TRIM16 significantly reduced the growth
inhibitory effects of the vemurafenib and C012 combination. These findings suggest
that the combination of C012 and vemurafenib may have therapeutic potential for
the treatment of melanoma, and, that reactivation of TRIM16 may be an effective
strategy for patients with this disease.

Introduction

rising, particularly amongst young [2] and middleaged adults [3]. While early detection and removal by
surgical excision results in high cure rates, patients with
metastatic melanoma have limited effective treatment
options available. Approximately 50% of melanoma
patients harbour activating mutations in the v-raf murine
sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) protein,

Melanoma is a highly aggressive malignancy, and
although it accounts for only a small percentage of skin
cancers overall, it is responsible for the majority of skin
cancer deaths [1]. Furthermore, melanoma is an increasing
clinical problem with the global incidence of the disease

most commonly BRAFV600E, resulting in MAPK pathway
activation, while another 15–20% of patients possess
mutations in neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene
homolog (NRAS), activating both the MAPK and PI3K
pathways [1, 4]. Patients with the NRAS mutation
(mutually exclusive to BRAF mutations) have a worse
prognosis than BRAF mutant patients [5]. The remaining
patients that have neither gene mutation typically
have de-regulated kinases including amplification and
overexpression of PAK1 [6, 7], inactivation of the NF-1
tumor suppressor [8], loss of NF-1 associated with RAS
activation [9, 10] and cell cycle aberrations such as
CCND1 and CDK4 amplification [11].
As melanomas are deregulated via multiple
pathways and are able to by-pass mutant BRAF inhibitors
to reactivate oncogenic signalling [12–14], combination
treatment is essential to effectively treat the disease.
Therefore, an increased knowledge of the molecular
pathology of melanoma is required to understand how
drug combinations might contribute to an increased anticancer signal. Determination of patient subgroups that are
likely to respond to treatment is also important [15–17].
Whilst the advent of targeted therapies in the form of
BRAF inhibitors has yielded clinically meaningful benefit
for patients harbouring the BRAF mutation, patients that
do not have a druggable mutant kinase have few targeted
therapy options available. To date, there are no Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved targeted therapies
for NRAS mutant melanoma patients [18]. In clinical
trials, only one targeted therapy in the form of a MEK
inhibitor, binimetinib (MEK162), is currently being
investigated for NRASQ61 mutant patient treatment vs
dacarbazine (Clinical trial NCT01763164). The limited
availability of therapeutic options highlight BRAFWT/
NRAS mutant patients as a subgroup most in need of new
therapeutic treatment strategy and a better understanding
of disease pathology.
Treatment modalities for metastatic melanoma
involve immunotherapy, such as nivolumab and
ipilumamib [19]. However, identification of patient subgroups that are likely to respond to immune based therapy
is still largely unknown [20, 21]. This emphasises the
important role targeted therapies have to play in melanoma
treatment. Targeted BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, was
approved for BRAFV600mut patients by the FDA in 2011
and is in frequent clinical use. Vemurafenib has been
shown to improve median progression free survival
(6.9 vs 1.6 months) and median overall survival (13.6 vs
9.7 months) in patients compared to the previous standard
of care, dacarbazine [21]. Recent data has clearly indicated
the benefit of combining BRAF inhibitors with MEKinhibitors with the combination of dabrafenib, trametinib,
vemurafenib and cobimetinib improving overall survival

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

compared to BRAF-inhibitor monotherapy [22–24].
Treatment of NRASQ61 melanoma with the MEK
inhibitor, binimetinib (MEK162), is currently in clinical
trial and is the only targeted treatment for NRAS mutant
melanomas. There is an additional need for novel therapies
and approaches to the treatment of BRAF wild-type
melanomas including NRAS mutant melanoma. Moreover
even in BRAF mutant melanoma the vast majority of
patients still develop progressive disease after combined
BRAF and MEK-inhibition [21]. Thus, improvements in
the effectiveness of these targeted therapies in the form of
synergistic combination treatments are urgently required.
Identification of tumor suppressor proteins in
melanoma is informative of the steps in melanomagenesis
as it progresses from normal nevus to a malignant
melanoma. Members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family
of proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
numerous cancers, both as oncoproteins and tumor
suppressor proteins [25]. These proteins typically carry
a characteristic RING b-box-Coiled-coil organisational
structure [25, 26]. We have previously reported that
the expression of TRIM16 is significantly reduced
in vivo during the transition of normal skin to squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC), while increased expression of
this protein reduces SCC cell migration in vitro [27]. In
addition, we have observed that TRIM16 can act as a
tumor suppressor in the childhood cancer neuroblastoma
[28], via the binding and down-regulation of cytoplasmic
vimentin and nuclear E2F1 [28]. In melanoma, we have
shown TRIM16 protein expression to be significantly
associated with favourable prognosis in stage III melanoma
patients, while enforced expression identified TRIM16 as
a growth and metastasis suppressor, its effect mediated
via IFNβ1 transcriptional activation [29]. Moreover, we
showed high levels of TRIM16 in melanoma tissues from
patients treated with vemurafenib correlated with clinical
response. These data suggest the potential of TRIM16 as
a candidate tumor suppressor protein in melanoma and
that restoration of TRIM16 expression may be a potential
therapeutic strategy for melanoma treatment.
In this study, we have identified an anti-melanoma
compound (C012) through high throughput chemical
library screening. We have shown that C012 synergises
with vemurafenib, targeting both BRAF wild-type and
mutant cells. The combination of C012 with vemurafenib
decreased melanoma cell viability, and increased TRIM16
protein expression in vitro and in vivo. TRIM16 expression
was required for the maximal C012/vemurafenib
combination efficacy in vitro. Overall, our findings have
identified a novel small molecule with clinical potential in
the treatment of melanoma, including BRAFWT melanoma,
and provide mechanistic insights into the role of TRIM16
in this process.

and MM200 cell lines (Figure 2A iv–v) and low additive
BLISS scores (Figure 2B). Combination C012 and
vemurafenib treatment of Mel-JD cells yielded a 4-fold
decrease in cell viability (Figure 2A i) and showed the
highest BLISS synergy index of 0.33 (Figure 2B).
To further assess the synergistic relationship
between C012 and vemurafenib, drug combination
synergy studies were undertaken using the IC50 dose
of vemurafenib and C012 for each melanoma line and
performing a constant ratio dose range with assessment
of cell viability (Figure 2C). Synergy was determined
by using the Calcusyn algorithm and represented by
the combination index (CI) values at ED90 where a
CI < 0.9 indicates a synergistic relationship and CI
values > 1 indicate drug antagonism [31]. Synergy at
greater cytopathic drug concentrations (ED90 and above)
is considered more therapeutically relevant than ED50
synergy values [31]. At ED90 concentrations, synergy
was observed in all 5 BRAFWT melanoma cell lines and
in 4/5 BRAFV600E melanoma lines (Figure 2C). These
results demonstrate efficacy of combination C012 and
vemurafenib against a range of melanomas, irrespective
of BRAF/NRAS mutational status.
In order to assess the effect of combination
treatment on normal cells, standardised doses of C012 and
vemurafenib were used to treat normal fibroblasts, WI-38
and MRC-5 and normal human epidermal melanocytes
(NHEM). Combination treatment resulted in only minor
fold changes in cell viability compared to control and
single agent treatment (Supplementary Figure 1A i–iii).
BLISS additivity scores revealed no synergy with
combination treatment in non-malignant cells
(Supplementary Figure 1A iv).
To further assess the potential for synergy between
C012 and vemurafenib, clonogenicity assays were
performed. For this study, three BRAFWT/NRASQ61R
melanoma cell lines (Mel-JD, Mel-RM and ME4405) and
three BRAFV600E/NRASWT melanoma cell lines (MM200,
A375 and Mel-CV) were treated with C012/vemurafenib
as single agents or in combination. Four of six cell lines
exhibited a significant reduction in colony forming ability
as indicated by the Bliss additivity scores (Figure 3A
and 3B). Two cell lines, ME4405 and Mel-CV were
resistant to the C012/vemurafenib combination treatment
and displayed antagonism as assessed by a Bliss additivity
score of −0.17 (ME4405) and −0.25 (Mel-CV) (Figure 3A).
Thus, sensitivity or resistance to the combination did not
associate with mutant BRAF or NRAS status in melanoma
cell lines.

Identification of C012 as an anti-melanoma
compound
A high throughput screening of a 10,560 compound
library subset from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute,
for enhancers of the HDAC inhibitor, SAHA, identified
three candidate compounds that had single agent activity
towards a panel of melanoma cell lines. The compound
that was most efficacious over a range of melanoma
cells was identified as 2-(2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-9H-benzo
[d]imidazo[1,2-a]imidazol-9-yl)-N,N-diethylethanamine
(Figure 1A), subsequently referred to as C012. To
determine whether C012 had specific cytotoxicity to
melanoma cells over other cancer cells, C012 was
screened at 10 µM as a single agent for its effects on cell
viability using the Alamar Blue assay against a panel of
human cancer cell lines (neuroblastoma, breast, ovarian,
lung, liver), normal human fibroblasts (MRC-5 and WI-38)
and 10 human melanoma cell lines (Figure 1B). C012
demonstrated marked single agent activity against
melanoma cells, but showed reduced toxicity towards
normal fibroblasts and other cancer cell lines (P = 0.0001,
Figure 1B). This toxicity was not dependent on the BRAF
and NRAS mutational status, as indicated in Figure 1B.
Thus, the cytopathic effect of C012 as a single agent was
greater for melanoma cells compared to other cancer types
or normal fibroblasts.

C012 synergises with vemurafenib in BRAF
wild-type and mutant cell lines
Currently, single agent treatment of metastatic
melanoma leads to only transient tumor response;
therefore, C012 was tested for potential synergistic activity
in combination with clinically approved agents in the
treatment of melanoma. These include the MAPK pathway
targeting agents: vemurafenib, sorafenib and trametinib.
We also combined C012 with the PI3K inhibitor, PI-103,
and rapamycin, targeting the mTOR signal, which has
been shown to have pre-clinical significance in preventing
melanoma tumor growth [30]. C012 was used at an IC20
dose of 4 μM, in combination with these drugs at IC50
concentrations against Mel-JD and MM200 cell lines
(Figure 2A). Cell viability was assessed using the Alamar
Blue assay (Figure 2A). These cell lines were selected
as they exhibited similar cytotoxicity to C012 treatment
(Figure 1B) and represented the commonest mutant
melanoma pathologies: BRAFWT/NRASQ61R (Mel-JD)
and BRAFV600E/NRASWT (MM200). Notably, agents that
targeted the MAPK pathway (vemurafenib, sorafenib
and trametinib) were the most effective in combination
with C012 in both cell lines (Figure 2A i–iii) determined
by their respective Bliss additivity score (Figure 2B).
Combination of C012 with PI-103 or rapamycin yielded a

pathway, functioning as mutually exclusive aberrations
in melanoma not exposed to BRAF-inhibitors. NRAS
mutant melanoma cells treated with vemurafenib exhibit a
paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway due to CRAF/
BRAF dimerisation and CRAF transactivation [33, 34].
To understand the mechanism of action of the C012 and
vemurafenib combination, we used immunoblotting of
proteins in two BRAFWT/NRASQ61R (Mel-JD and Mel-RM)
and two NRASWT/BRAFV600E (MM200 and A375)
melanoma cell lines treated with combination C012/
vemurafenib to determine if the drug combination altered
MAPK pathway activity. We found no significant change
in levels of MEK and ERK phosphorylation with the
C012/vemurafenib combination treatment compared to
single agent vemurafenib treatment of BRAFWT/NRASQ61R
(Mel-JD and Mel-RM) cells (Supplementary Figure 2A)
which instead displayed the expected MAPK pathway

activation with vemurafenib treatment. In contrast,
NRASWT/BRAFV600E (MM200 and A375) cells showed
the expected decrease in MEK and ERK phosphorylation
(Supplementary Figure 2). These data suggest that the antimelanoma effect of combination C012 and vemurafenib
was not due to altered signalling of the MAPK pathway.
TRIM16 has been recently identified as a candidate
tumor suppressor gene in melanoma and is reactivated
by vemurafenib in BRAFV600E melanoma cells [29]. We
performed immunoblotting to assess TRIM16 protein
expression following C012, vemurafenib or C012 and
vemurafenib combination treatment of melanoma cell lines.
We showed an increase in TRIM16 protein expression
in the two BRAFWT/NRASQ61R cell lines, Mel-JD
cells (Figure 3C) and Mel-RM, with the combination
treatment (Supplementary Figure 2A). TRIM16 protein
levels increased with vemurafenib alone treatment of

The combination of C012 and vemurafenib
requires TRIM16 protein expression

MM200 and A375 cell lines, but not with combination
treatment (Supplementary Figure 2A). To determine
if the increase in TRIM16 protein was specific to the
combination of C012 and vemurafenib, we assessed
inhibitors, sorafenib, and trametinib for TRIM16
reactivation when combined with C012 (Figure 3C). We
found that the combination of C012 and vemurafenib,
but not C012 and trametinib or C012 and sorafenib, was
effective at reactivating TRIM16 (Figure 3C). Interestingly,
on examination of endogenous expression of TRIM16
protein, we observed that the two cell lines that were most
resistant to the combination treatment, ME4405 and MelCV (Figure 2A and 2B) also had the highest endogenous
expression levels of TRIM16 (Figure 3D). TRIM16 protein
did not increase in the control normal fibroblasts, MRC-5,
and there was no observed change in ERK phosphorylation
in the fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure 2B).

We have previously shown that TRIM16 is
significantly decreased during melanoma tumorigenesis
and is a candidate tumor suppressor in metastatic
melanoma [29]. To determine whether increased TRIM16
expression mediated the cytopathic effects of combination
C012 and vemurafenib treatment, we used two TRIM16specific siRNAs to knockdown TRIM16 for 24 hours
and then treated the two BRAFWT/NRASQ61R (Mel-JD
and Mel-RM) cell lines with the C012/vemurafenib
combination for an additional 48 hours. We found that
siRNAs specific to TRIM16 inhibited the cytopathic
effects of the drug combination in Mel-JD (***P < 0.001)
(Blue lines, Figure 4A) and Mel-RM (***P < 0.001) (Blue
lines, Supplementary Figure 3A) cell lines. Single agent

In vivo anti-tumor efficacy of C012 as a single
agent and combining with vemurafenib was evaluated
against a Mel-JD xenograft model. While C012 at a dose
of 15 mg/kg showed a modest anti-tumor activity with a
tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 33%, its combination
treatment significantly decreased tumor growth between
days 8–10, resulting in an overall TGI of 73.4% compared
to control **P < 0.01 (Figure 5A). Immunohistochemical
analysis of tumor samples showed a significant increase
in TRIM16 protein expression in the combination treated
group after 21 days of treatment with representative
immunohistochemistry for red chromogen TRIM16
staining is shown for each group (Figure 5B). Semiquantitative histological scoring data from all mice
representing 8 mice per treatment group (Figure 5C)
showed a statistically significant increase (**P < 0.01)
confirming the enhanced level of TRIM16 expression.
These data demonstrate that combination therapy with
C012 and vemurafenib had in vivo efficacy against
melanoma cells and suggest that induction of TRIM16
may be a necessary component of the therapeutic effect in
the Mel-JD BRAFWT/NRASQ61R melanoma subtype.

C012 and VEM also reached significance (**P < 0.01),
but to a lesser degree than combination treatment
(Figure 4A). Immunoblotting confirmed that the induction
of TRIM16 protein expression by combination treatment
of Mel-JD (Figure 4B) and Mel-RM (Supplementary
Figure 3B) cell lines was lost with TRIM16 siRNA
transfection. These data indicated that TRIM16 induction
by combination treatment is partially required for the
cytopathic combination drug effect. As TRIM16 protein
expression is known to induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma
[35], we overexpressed TRIM16 in low TRIM16
expressing melanoma cell lines, Mel-JD, A753 and G361
and showed an increase in apoptosis in the TRIM16
overexpressing cells compared to empty vector controls
(P < 0.05) (Supplementary Figure 4A). We next showed
that the combination treatment induced apoptosis in MelJD and Mel-RM cells as assessed by TUNEL assay in
Mel-JD cells (***P < 0.001) (Figure 4C) and Mel-RM
cells (*P < 0.05) (Supplementary Figure 3C). To determine
whether activation of the MAPK pathway was required for
cytopathic effects of the combination, the MEK inhibitor,
trametinib, was used to block the MAPK pathway and
cell viability was assessed in Mel-JD cells (Figure 4D).
Addition of trametinib had a modest but significant
inhibitory effect on the cytopathic activity of C012 and
vemurafenib combination therapy (P < 0.001).
Since TRIM16 is a regulator of IFNβ1 transcription
[29], we used IFNβ1-specific siRNA to determine whether
IFNβ1 transcription was necessary for the cytopathic
effects of the combination treatment. We showed that
IFNβ1 is also partially required for the cytopathic effect
of the combination. (***P < 0.001) (Supplementary
Figure 4B). Incomplete loss of TRIM16 protein (Figure 4B)
despite siRNA against TRIM16 may be explained by
the ability of VEM to stabilise TRIM16 protein [29].
Collectively, these data suggest that TRIM16 and
IFNβ1 activation are important to the drug combination
mechanism of action.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have identified a small molecule,
C012, which can synergistically promote the potency of
vemurafenib to increase drug efficacy in BRAFWT and
BRAFV600E melanoma cells. This synergistic relationship
was displayed by reduction in cell viability, colony
forming ability and by the induction of apoptosis in
cells treated with the drug combination. Mechanistically,
this combination effect is mediated, in part, by the
re-activation of TRIM16 expression, previously shown to
be a metastasis suppressor in melanomagenesis that can be
restored by vemurafenib in BRAFV600 melanoma in vitro
and in patients treated with vemurafenib [29].
We found that C012 combined most strongly
with vemurafenib and other MAPK pathway inhibitors
(sorafenib and trametinib), but with marginal combination
effect with AKT and mTOR pathway inhibitors (PI-103
and rapamycin) suggesting C012 synergistically promotes
cytotoxicity with MAPK pathway targeting agents.
Human melanocyte and fibroblast lines did not undergo
any appreciable increased cell death with combination
treatment suggesting a likely therapeutic index. More
intensive investigation is required to understand the full
molecular profile of C012 and vemurafenib particularly
which melanoma subtype that this combination may
benefit.
Reactivation of silenced tumor suppressors offers a
mechanism of re-establishing normal cellular signalling
and in some cases the induction of apoptosis. One such
example is the reactivation of p53 in melanoma, which,
though wild-type in 90% of melanomas, is inactivated by
aberrant expression of its regulator proteins [36]. A study

Combination of C012 and vemurafenib
treatment is anti-tumorigenic
To determine the potential application of C012
use in vivo, we performed microsomal stability assays
for assessment of oral administration, serum half-life
studies for compound administration intravenously,
and determination of its maximum tolerated dose. We
found the microsomal stability of C012 to be low at 13.5
minutes (Supplementary Figure 5A). We also assessed
the pharmacological properties of C012 by intravenous
administration and found the plasma half-life to be a
favourable 70 minutes with a Cmax of 1761 ng/mL (N = 3)
(Supplementary Figure 5B) and indicated this to be a more
effective route of C012 administration. We determined
the maximum tolerated dose of C012 to be 15 mg/kg
(Supplementary Table 1A and 1B).

of compounds that reactivate p53 in melanoma positively
identified nutlin-3a as a p53 reactivator and also found
potentiation of MEK inhibition upon p53 reactivation [37].
Here, we show that TRIM16 expression induced apoptosis
in a range of melanoma cell lines and that the specific
expression of TRIM16 with combination treatment was
required to induce maximal cytotoxic effect. In addition,
TRIM16 expression may potentiate the cytotoxic effect
of vemurafenib treatment on BRAFWT melanomas.
We found two melanoma cell lines were resistant to
combination treatment, both in clonogenicity and cell
viability assessment. Interestingly, these two lines showed
a markedly higher basal TRIM16 expression compared to
the sensitive lines. We hypothesize that these lines may
be intrinsically resistant to combination treatment due

to already high levels of TRIM16 activation and that the
apoptotic action of TRIM16 may be suppressed by other
means in these cells.
We have shown previously that high TRIM16
expression correlates with favourable patient prognosis in a
cohort of stage III melanoma patients [29]. As combination
treatment of vemurafenib and C012 increases TRIM16
protein expression, we investigated the tumor growth rate
of engrafted BRAFWT/NRASQ61R melanoma cells, sensitive
to the drug combination in vitro, in a xenograft model. We
observed that the combination of C012 and vemurafenib
significantly slowed tumor progression and caused an
initial decrease in tumor volume, in agreement with our
in vitro data. The combination effect is overcome, with
the tumor resuming growth and exhibiting the typical

adaptability of melanoma to circumvent drug treatment
[38]. However, the observation of a significant delay in
tumor growth with the combination treatment indicates
in vivo efficacy and potential for further drug development.
Encouragingly, tumor immunohistochemical staining
for TRIM16 expression showed a significant increase
in the combination treatment group supporting our
in vitro results which showed that induction of TRIM16
expression was required for the cytopathic effect of the
combination. Further studies are required to determine the
optimal drug dosing, timing, and pharmacokinetic profile
of C012 to gain maximum drug efficacy.
Clinically, vemurafenib is not currently used for
the treatment of non-BRAF mutant melanoma due to a

lack of efficacy and the paradoxical transactivation of
the key driver of melanomagenesis, the MAPK pathway,
and the subsequent cell proliferation [39]. However,
synergy between vemurafenib and small molecules in
NRAS driven melanoma has been described in vitro. One
study demonstrated a synergistic relationship between
metformin and vemurafenib in 7/8 BRAF wild-type/
NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines tested [40]. Despite
these results, the vast majority of studies investigating
novel drug combinations for vemurafenib do not assess
BRAFWT/NRASQ61R mutant melanoma cells. Our novel
mechanistic insight of the re-activation of TRIM16 in
this study provides a basis for further investigation of
small molecules that induce TRIM16 for the treatment

Figure 4: TRIM16 is partially required for combination of C012 and vemurafenib reduction in cell viability. (A) Mel-JD

cells were transfected with control siRNA or two specific TRIM16 siRNAs (TRIM16-1 and TRIM16-2) for 24 hours before DMSO control,
C012 (4 μM), VEM (5 μM) or combination treatment for an additional 48 hours. Cell viability was assessed by Alamar Blue and expressed
as percentage of DMSO control cells. (B) Western blotting was used to determine the corresponding protein expression of TRIM16 with
GAPDH as a loading control. (C) Mel-JD cells were treated as indicated for 72 hours and apoptosis measured using the TUNEL assay. (D)
Mel-JD cells were treated with standardized doses of C012 and VEM and an IC80 dose of TRA as indicated and cell viability was measured
by the Alamar Blue assay. Data represents mean + SEM and was analysed by the Student’s t-test ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.

of metastatic melanoma. It is unknown whether TRIM16
reactivation may potentiate other targeted anti-melanoma
therapy and may have a wider application in enhancing
drug treatments. It is also worth exploring the possibility
of IFNβ1 agonists as anti-melanoma agents as small
molecules eliciting the type 1 interferon response have
been investigated as candidate anti-viral agents [41] and
may have application to melanoma therapy. Furthermore,
the recent development of BRAF inhibitors that do
not trans-activate MAPK signalling termed ‘paradoxbreakers’ [42] may synergise with C012 and could offer
a combination therapy purposed for BRAFWT melanomas.
Further testing of C012 as a cationic amphiphile
is required to assess whether C012 mediates its effect
by membrane perturbation or by specific targeting of an

as yet unknown protein [43]. Further studies involving
optimization of C012 to sub-micromolar levels of activity
and structure-activity relationship (SAR) development,
correlation of SAR with unbound concentration and
efficacy in vivo and biomarker (TRIM16) response, would
further support a specific action of C012 and validate this
compound as a candidate for therapeutic development.
Such studies are beyond the scope of the current
manuscript but have been initiated and will be reported
on in due course.
Overall, our findings offer novel mechanistic
insights of potential therapeutic targets in melanoma.
Here, we implicate reactivation of TRIM16 as being
partially required for tumor targeting by the combination
therapy and suggest TRIM16 reactivation as an area

Figure 5: Combination of C012 and vemurafenib shows a decrease in tumor volume and increase in TRIM16
in vivo. (A) Female, 5 week old Balb-(c) nude mice were engrafted with 2 × 106 Mel-JD melanoma cells. A tumor volume of 250 mm3 was

established before randomization into DMSO control, C012 at 15 mg/kg (intravenous), vemurafenib (VEM) at 75 mg/kg (oral gavage) or
combination treatment groups (N = 8/group). Dosing was administered 5 days on, 2 days off for 21 days. Day 0-14 is shown and the tumor
growth inhibition (TGI) calculated. Tumors were excised at 21 days. (B) Immunohistochemistry for TRIM16 expression was performed on
excised tumors. TRIM16 expression can be seen with positive red chromogen staining. Representative examples are shown. (C) TRIM16
expression was quantified by assigning a staining intensity value by assessment of the average of three sections from each tumor sample.
Each section contained at approximately 100 cells. The histogram bars represent 8 individual tumor samples assessed from each treatment
group. Data represents mean + SEM and was analysed by the Student’s t-test **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.

proliferate for 4–6 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2 incubation,
after which time a measurement was taken to record the
colour change due to Alamar Blue dye cleavage. The
reading was normalized to the baseline reading for each well
and colorimetric changes were analysed compared to their
respective controls using GraphPad Prism version 6.01.
Apoptosis was measured by the quantification
of histone-complexed DNA fragments (mono- and
oligonucleosomes) from the cell cytoplasm using a cell
death detection ELISAPLUS kit from Roche Applied Science
(Mannheim, Germany) as per manufacturer instructions.
TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)
(Roche Diagnostics Australia) was used as a secondary
confirmation of apoptosis as per manufacturer’s instruction
and flow cytometry analysis using FACSCalibur flow
cytometry (BD BioSciences) as indicated.

a potential strategy for targeting BRAF wild-type and
mutant melanomas.

MATERIALs AND METHODS
High-throughput compound screening
A pilot screen of a library of 10,560 compounds
from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (Melbourne,
Australia), was screened for enhancers of the HDAC
inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), at
1.9 μM in a cell-based assay using MDA-MB-231 cells. A
total of 352 hit pick compounds (that reduced cell viability
< 40%) were selected and screened in the presence or
absence of SAHA. 24 compounds maintained < 40% cell
viability in the presence of SAHA and > 70% viability in
the absence of SAHA (at least 55% difference) giving a
hit rate of 0.23%. The 24 hit compounds were assessed for
the ability to enhance SAHA in melanoma cells, MM200
and Mel-JD. Three compounds showed single agent
anti-melanoma activity. One compound (C012) showed
significant synergy when combined with the BRAF
inhibitor, vemurafenib, and was selected for further assay.

Western blotting and immunohistochemistry
Protein lysate was standardized using the BCA
protein quantitation assay kit as per manufacturer’s
instructions (Thermo Scientific, IL, USA). Western
blotting used the following antibodies: polyclonal TRIM16
(Bethyl laboratories, TX, USA), rabbit polyclonal actin
antibody (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and anti- GAPDH
antibody (Abcam, NSW, Australia). Samples were run
on a Bio-Rad criterion (Tris-HCl) 10.5–14% gradient gel
(Bio-Rad, NSW, Australia).
Whole tissue sections from excised xenograft tumor
were probed with specific TRIM16 antibody at a 1:250
dilution (Bethyl laboratories, TX, USA) and IgG at a 1:500
dilution (Dako, VIC, Australia) was used as a negative
control. A rabbit-biotinylated secondary antibody was
used at 1:500 dilution (Dako, VIC, Australia). Samples
were blindly graded on an arbitrary scale of 0–2 in 0.25
increments, with 2 being the highest staining intensity
and 0 as negative staining. Tissues were graded at three
different tumor sites to allow for heterogeneity of staining
intensity within the tissue. Data were analysed using the
Student’s t-test. Results were considered statistically
significant with a p value of < 0.05.

Tissue culture, siRNA and plasmid transfection
Melanoma cell lines, CHL-1, IPC-298 and SK-Mel-2
were kindly gifted from Professor Grant MacArthur at the
Peter MacCallum Institute, Melbourne. Cell lines, Mel-JD,
Mel-RM, Mel-CV, M4405 and MM200 were kindly
gifted from Professor Xu Dong Zhang at the University
of Newcastle. Melanoma cell lines, A375 and G361
were purchased from ATCC. All lines were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (Life Technologies
Australia, VIC, Australia) supplemented with 5% foetal
calf serum and incubated at 37°C/5% CO2. TRIM161
siRNA
5′AGTAATTCACCATGCAGGTTT-3′,
TRIM16-2 siRNA 5′TCTCCCTCCTGCATTTGTGTT-3′
were custom designed and transfected at 20 nM using
lipofectamine 2000 as the transfection agent and siControl
non-targeting pool (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) as a
control. Smartpool ONTARGERTplus IFNβ1 siRNA was
used (Dharmacon, USA). TRIM16 over-expression was
achieved by transient transfection of the pcDNA3.1/mychis tag plasmid containing the full-length TRIM16 cDNA
under a CMV promoter using lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies Australia, VIC, Australia).

Drug treatment and colony forming assays
Standardized dosing of vemurafenib and C012 was
5 μM and 4 μM, respectively, for BRAFWT cell lines,
and 0.5 μM and 4 μM for BRAFMT cell lines. Treatment
duration was for 72 hours unless otherwise stated.
For colony forming assays, melanoma cells are
seeded at 100 cells/well in 6-well plates. Cells are cultured
with control (DMSO only), C012 at 4 µM, vemurafenib
at 0.5 µM (BRAFMT) or 5 µM (BRAFWT) or combination
C012/vemurafenib in 2 mL of media. Colonies were
allowed to form over 14 days and were then fixed and
stained with 2 mL of 6% gluteraldehyde and 0.5% crystal

Cell viability and apoptosis assays
Alamar Blue assays were performed on melanoma
cells had been treated with drugs for 72 hours, unless
otherwise stated. At the specified time, Alamar Blue was
added (1:10) dilution to proliferating cells in the culture
media and a baseline colorimetric measurement taken

Pharmacokinetic determination and in vivo
xenograft study

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS and funding

The pharmacokinetics of C012 was studied in
healthy Wistar Rats. Animals were supplied by Laboratory
Animal Services, the University of Adelaide, SA, Australia
and approval for the study was obtained from the ethics
committee of SA Pathology. After overnight fasting, C012
was administrated i.v. (5 mg/kg) via the tail vein. Blood
samples were collected at 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120,
180, 300 and 420 min after dosing. Plasma was separated
and stored at −20°C pending analysis. A Shimadzu Nexera
HPLC system was used to analyse the sample through a
Kinetex C18 1.7 u 50 × 2.1 mm column (Phenomenex, CA,
USA) at a mobile phase flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Mobile
phase A (MPA) was 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid
in water and mobile phase B (MPB) was 95% acetonitrile
and 0.1% formic acid. The mobile phase was run as
a gradient using the following timetable: 0.0–0.5 min
10% MPB; 0.5–3.0 min 10–55% MPB; 3.0–3.1 min
55–95% MPB; 3.1–3.4 min 95% MPB; 3.4–3.8 min 10%
MPB. C012 and internal standard were detected by a
triple TOF-MS 5600 (AB Sciex, Concord, ON, Canada)
in positive ESI mode following the mass transitions:
C012 m/z 377.2 t7 100.1. Peak areas were obtained from
known concentration calibrators of C012 and IS. These
were used to construct 2 non-zero 7-point calibration
curves from the C012/IS area ratios in the range 5–250
ng/mL and 250–2500 ng/mL respectively. The mean
values of concentration at each sampling time point were
used to conduct the pharmacokinetic analysis, which
was performed with Phoenix® WinNonlin® (Pharsight,
Certara™, L.P., NJ, USA) using a non-compartmental
model.
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of C012
in Balb-c nude mice treated at 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg
i.v. for a period of 2 weeks, 5 days on/2 days off (total
of 10 doses). Signs of toxicity were monitored by body
weight and physical symptoms. An MTD of 15 mg/kg was
determined and used for the subsequent xenograft study.
Mel-JD cells were engrafted into Balb-(c) nude mice
(2 × 106 cells) and tumor volume allowed to reach 200–
250 mm3. Vemurafenib was administered by oral gavage
(p.o.) at 75 mg/kg, C012 was administered by intravenous
(i.v.) injection at 15 mg/kg and relevant control vehicles
(5% DMSO in PBS, i.v., p.o.). All treatment groups were
given for a period of five days on/two days off for a total
of 14 days. Tumor volume was measured using callipers
every second day and animals were monitored for body
weight and physical symptoms. The percentage of tumor
growth inhibition was calculated using the following
formula %TGI = (1-{Tt/T0 / Ct/C0} / 1-{C0/Ct}) X 100
