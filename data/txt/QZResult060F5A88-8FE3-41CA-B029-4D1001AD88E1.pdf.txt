ABSTRACT
Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is a global health problem because of limited
treatments and poor prognosis. Annonaceous acetogenins (ACGs) has been reported
to exert anti-tumorigenic effects in cancer, yet the mechanism underlying its effects on
GC remains largely unknown. Notch signaling plays a critical role in cell proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis. Therefore, it may contribute to the development of GC.
This study aims to explore the role of Notch2 in ACGs’ activities in GC cells.
Results: ACGs inhibited GC cells’ viability in a dose dependent manner and led
to cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase with an increased Notch2
expression. Additionally, Notch2 siRNA reduced ACGs-induced cell growth inhibition
while Notch2 cDNA transfection did the opposite.
Materials and Methods: ACGs were administrated in GC cells and cell proliferation
was assayed by MTS, cell apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry.
Additionally, the expression of Notch2 and the downstream target Hes1 were
identified by Western blot. Furthermore, Notch2-siRNA transfection and Notch2-cDNA
were performed to investigate the role of Notch2 in the antitumor effect of ACGs.
Conclusions: Up-regulation of Notch2 by ACGs is a potential therapeutic strategy for GC.

INTRODUCTION

2,000~2,200 species, is the largest family in Magnoliales.
The whole plants, seeds or fruits of Annonaceous plants
have been widely explored as popular traditional medicines
for the treatment of pain, diarrhea, fever and hypotension.
Annonaceous acetogenins (ACGs) is a group of fatty acid
derivatives which are isolated from Annonaceae plants
[1]. In 1982, when the first ACGs compound, uvaricin,
was isolated, its excellent in-vivo anti-leukemia activity
aroused widespread interest amongst medicinal chemicals
and natural products to isolate and identify this class of
compounds [2]. The potentially useful applications of
ACGs were exhibited, such as cytotoxicity, anti-microbial,
anti-malarial, anti-feedant, anti-viral, anti-tumoral, antihelminthic, pesticidal, and immunosuppressive activities
[2, 3]. The powerful cytotoxicity against tumor made
ACGs as another “tomorrow anticancer star” after
paclitaxel. However, the antitumorigenic mechanism of
ACGs is still unclear.

Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common
malignancies in global scale. It also acts as one of major
causes of cancer-related death. Many current available
treatments for gastric cancer, such as surgery and
chemotherapy, are less optimal, and the prognosis of
GC is rather poor. This is because of lacking complete
understanding in the mechanisms for GC. Therefore, it is
critical to explore alternative treatments and develop more
effective therapies.
One promising candidate for chemopreventive
and chemotherapeutic drugs is traditional Chinese
medicine. A variety of novel natural compounds, such as
podophyllotoxin, paclitaxel, camptothecin, and vinblastine,
have been isolated and applied as agents for cancer
therapies. Annonaceae, belonged to soursop family or
custard apple family, with approximately 120 genera and

Notch signaling, a highly conservative signaling
pathway, is involved in a variety of cellular processes
including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis,
fate and survival rate. Additionally, the abnormity of
Notch signaling is associated with oncogenesis [4–6],
which usually manifests as abnormality of Notch signal
components like ligands, receptors, and downstream
proteins. The Notch signaling in mammals consists of
four receptors (Notch 1-4) and five ligands Delta-like
ligand 1/3/4 (DLL1/3/4) and Jagged (1/2) [7]. After the
interaction of the receptors to their ligands, the γ-secretase
cleaves the transmembrane domain of Notch receptor to
release the intracellular domain of Notch receptor (NICD),
which was translocated into the nucleus as a transcriptional
coactivator, regulating the expression of target genes, such
as the hairy enhancer of split (Hes) and Hes-related (Hey)
family [7]. Clearly, activated Notch receptor can play a
tumor suppressive or an oncogenic role depending on the
tumor type and cellular context [8, 9]. For example, Notch
acts as a tumor suppressor in squamous cell carcinoma of
skin [10], cervical uterus [11], hepatocellular carcinoma
and neuroendocrine tumors of lung and gastrointestinal
tract [12]. On the contrary, Notch may have oncogenic
impact on breast cancer [13], colorectal cancer [14],
neuroblastoma [15], and lung cancer [16]. At present, a
number of researches have been conducted to explore the
association between Notch signaling pathway and GC in
human. However, the function of components of Notch
pathway in GC is still controversial because of its indicated
different even opposite effects [17]. On one hand, Notch1
has been detected to be expressed in normal gastric
mucosa as well as most GC cell lines [18], on the other
hand, some data illustrated that there was no expression
in normal gastric mucosa [17]. The meta-analysis by Du
X et al. revealed that Notch1 was expressed in both GC
tissues and normal mucosa, while significantly higher
expression was found in cancer tissues than in normal
tissues, suggesting the activation of Notch1 in GC [19].
This is consistent with the oncogenic role of Notch1 in
many solid malignancies. As for Notch2, Sun et al. proved
that Notch2 was overexpressed in GC. Additionally, coexpression and nuclear co-translocation of Notch2 and
its downstream target protein Hes1 were seen to be more
frequent than Notch1 both in vitro and in vivo in GC [17],
suggesting that Notch2 signal pathway would be more
important in GC carcinogenesis and progression. Tseng et
al. showed that the activated Notch2 would promote both
cell proliferation and xenografted tumor growth of GC
cells through cyclooxygenase-2 [20]. Conversely, Guo et
al. showed that Notch2 as a tumor suppressor gene could
inhibit cell invasion of human GC [21]. No doubt that, it is
necessary to detect potential roles of Notch signaling and
the activation patterns in different tumor types without any
initial impression.
To date, the role of Notch2 signal pathway in the
antitumor activity of ACGs has not been investigated.

In this study, ACGs was administered in GC cells to
detect the cellular process affected by this compound and
whether it played a tumor suppressor role through the
regulation of Notch2.

RESULTS
The expression of Notch2 was increased or
decreased in GC cell lines
In order to evaluate the possible role of Notch2 in
gastric carcinogenesis, we screened a panel of 5 GC cell
lines for the relative expression of Notch2 at mRNA
level by quantitative real-time PCR and at protein
level by western blot. Compared with normal gastric
mucosa cell line GES-1, Notch2 expression varied
quantitatively with GC cell lines. Notch2 expression
was higher in AGS and SGC-7901 and lower in MGC803, MKN-28 and MKN-45 (Figure 1A), which was
consistent with the published results. IC50 of ACGs to
cells for 24 h was assayed by MTS. The IC50 of AGS
and MNK45 was approximately close with 5.02 ug/mL
and 6.25 ug/mL respectively (Figure 1B). Then AGS
(high Notch2 expression) and MKN-45(low Notch2
expression) were selected to perform in the following
experiments.

Cell growth inhibition by ACGs in a dosedependent manner
To investigate whether ACGs affects the viability of
GC cells, cells were treated by ACGs for 12, 24, 36 h with
2.5 μg/mL, 5 μg/mL, and 10 μg/mL respectively, and then
the growth of cells was measured by MTS. The inhibition
of cell growth by ACGs showed an increasing trend in a
dose-dependent manner in 24 h group and 36 h group in
both GC cell lines (Figure 2A). In addition, microscopy
images showed that ACGs treatment increased significant
cell shrinkage and decreased the cellular attachment in
comparison with the control group (Figure 2B).

Cell apoptosis induced by ACGs
In order to explore whether the cell growth
inhibition by ACGs was accompanied by the induction
of apoptosis, the effect of ACGs on GC cell death was
examined. After administration with 5 μg/mL ACGs for
12 h, 24 h, 36 h respectively, cells were stained with
Annexin V/PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. The
effect of induction of ACGs was detectable in all three
time points compared with the control group (Figure 3A).
Furthermore, GC cells were induced apoptosis by ACGs
in a dose-dependent manner after cells were treated with
different concentrations of 2.5, 5 and 10 μg/ml for 36 h
(Figure 3B).

Cell cycle was arrested in G0/G1 phase by ACGs

was increased in all ACGs-treated cells compared with
control group (Figure 5A). However, ACGs decreased
the expression of its down-stream target, Hes-1
(Figure 5B). The levels of Hes-1 did not correlate with
the level change of the Notch2 receptor. This discrepancy
may be attributed to the complicated cellular regulation of
Notch gene expression.

In order to explore whether the cell growth inhibition
by ACGs was accompanied by cell cycle arrest, the
effect of ACGs on GC cell cycle was examined. After
the treatment of ACGs with 2.5, 5 and 10 μg/ml for 36 h
respectively, the course of cell cycle was arrested in G0/G1
phase compared with the control group. The ratio of G0/G1
phase of AGS cell was increased to 67.52%, 69.18% and
74.19%, respectively. The ratio of G0/G1 phase of MKN45 cell was increased to 67.10%、70.75% and 73.98%,
respectively (Figure 4). These results suggested that ACGs
arrested the cell cycle of G0/G1 phase in GC cells.

siRNA mediated-down-regulation of Notch2
expression reduced ACGs-induced cell growth
inhibition in GC cells
To further study the tumor suppressive role of
notch2, Notch2-siRNA was conducted to evaluate the
effect of down-regulation of Notch2 signal pathway on
the antitumor activity of ACGs in vitro. As shown in
Figure 6, the expression of Notch2 was dramatically
decreased by Notch2-siRNA transfection and the growth
of cells transfected by Notch2-siRNA was considerably
faster than that of non-transfected cells. In addition, the
combination of Notch2-siRNA transfection and ACGs
treatment slightly inhibited cell growth compared with

ACGs increased Notch2 expression and
decreased Hes-1 expression
Based on above results, we wanted to clarify a
possibility that the effect of ACGs on Notch2 signaling.
Therefore, the expression of Notch2 was examined
after GC cells were respectively treated with 2.5, 5 and
10 μg/ml ACGs for 36h. The expression of Notch2

shown in Figure 7, Notch2 cDNA transfection induced upregulation of Notch2 protein confirmed by western blot,
and the growth of GC cells transfected with Notch2 cDNA
was considerably slower than that of non-transfected
cells. Moreover, this combination of over-expression
of Notch2 and ACGs treatment strongly inhibited cell
growth compared with ACGs-treated alone, suggesting
the combination promoted ACGs-induced cell growth
inhibition to a certain degree.

DISCUSSION

Notch signaling are complicated and the biologic effects
can exert opposite functions in time and context-dependent
manners [29, 30] even in the same tumor type [7]. For
instance, a tumor-suppressive function has been found
in skin and liver cancers, an oncogenic role in NSCLC
[7, 31] and a dual role in the same tumor type of colorectal
and pancreatic cancers [32, 33]. In addition, phenotypes
exhibited by the combined activation of multiple Notch
signaling may be different from either pathway alone
[34]. For example, Notch1 and Notch2 receptors work
oppositely on the survival of malignant mesothelioma cells
[35]. Notch2 receptor also shows the contrary functions
of endothelial cells growth compared with Notch1 and
Notch4 [36].
Mounting evidences suggested that Notch signaling
may participate in the regulation of GC progression
[17, 20, 37–39]. The intracellular domains of Notch1
and Notch2 receptors (N1ICD and N2ICD, respectively),
promoted cell proliferation and xenografted tumor
growth of human stomach adenocarcinoma SC-M1 cells
[20, 37]. The colony formation, invasion, migration, and
wound-healing abilities of SC-M1 cells were increased by
N2ICD expression, whereas these abilities were decreased
by Notch2 knockdown. Similarly, Notch2 knockdown
suppressed cancer progressions of AZ521 and AGS
GC cells [20]. In contrast, the findings of Bauer et al’s
study ascribed a tumor-suppressive role to Notch signal
pathway in GC, in which the close relationship of high
Notch1 and Notch2 expression was associated with early
tumor stages [40]. This result was essentially consistent
with a functional analysis of Notch2 in GC cell line MKN45, which indicated that down-regulation of Notch2 by
siRNA increased tumor cell invasion [21]. Additionally,
co-expression and nuclear co-translocation of Notch2

Annonaceous acetogenins (ACGs), which consists
of a series of natural products isolated exclusively from
Annonaceae species, exhibits significant cytotoxicity and
potent anticancer effect since 1900s [22]. There are more
evidences illustrating the anti-tumor effect of ACGs on
different cancers in the last 20 years [23]. AA005, which
mimics ACGs, induce colorectal cancer cell death [24]
and leads to the growth inhibition and autophagy in colon
cancer cells [21]. Similarly, Desacetyluvaricin, one of
ACGs components, inhibits the growth of colorectal cancer
cell line SW480 [25]. Thiophene-3-carboxamide analogue
of ACGs strongly inhibits the growth of human lung
cancer cell line NCI-H23 in the xenograft mouse without
critical toxicity [26]. The interactions among acetogenins
in Graviola (Annona muricata) leaves and flavonoids
synergistically confer protection against prostate cancer
[27]. Three new ACGs with mono-tetrahydrofuran rings
from graviola fruit (Annona muricata) demonstrate cell
growth inhibition in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells
[28] in a similar manner. In the current study, MTS assay
and flowcytometry analysis show that ACGs inhibited cell
growth and induce apoptosis in time and dose –dependent
manner. Additionally, cell cycle analysis indicated that
ACGs induced GC cells accumulation in G0/G1 phase
in a dose-dependent manner. Nevertheless, the exact
mechanisms of ACGs-induced these effects remain
obscure.
It is well known that Notch signal pathway is
involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis,
cell fate and maintenance of stem cells. Furthermore,
Notch signal pathway can exhibit tumor-suppressive or
oncogenic functions and the regulatory mechanisms of

cytometry for analyzing cell distribution at each phase of the cell cycle.

as well as the downstream target protein Hes-1 were
detected to be more frequent than Notch1 both in vitro and
in vivo in GC [17], suggesting that Notch2 mediated signal
pathway would be more vital in the tumorigenesis and
progression of GC. Consequently, Notch2 signal pathway
is clearly involved in the pathogenesis of GC, which is
intended to address whether ACGs may exert its antitumor
effect through Notch2 pathway.
In the current study, compared with normal gastric
mucosa cell, Notch2 expression was higher in AGS and
SGC-7901 and lower in MGC-803, MKN-28 and MKN45 confirmed by Q-PCR. AGS and MKN-45 were selected
to perform the subsequent experiments. We demonstrated
for the first time that ACGs treatment increased
Notch2 expression in a dose-dependent manner in GC
cells and induced apoptosis and arrested cell cycle in
G0/G1, suggesting regulation of Notch2 signaling may be
the antitumorigenic mechanism of ACGs. Furthermore,
loss-function by Notch2-siRNA and gain-function by
over-expression of Notch2-cDNA transfection in GC
cells were carried out prior to ACGs treatment. Notch2-

siRNA together with ACGs treatment reduced cell growth
inhibition to a greater degree compared with ACGs
alone. Conversely, the over-expression of Notch2 by
cDNA transfection promoted ACGs-induced cytotoxity
to a certain degree compared with ACGs alone. Taken
together, we strongly believe that up-regulation of Notch2
by ACGs is associated with cell growth inhibition and
linked mechanistically to apoptotic processes as well as
cell cycle G0/G1 arrest.
However, the levels of Hes-1 in GC cells did not
correlate with the level change of Notch2 receptor. This
discrepancy may be attributed to the complicated cellular
regulation of Notch gene expressions. The complicated
inter-relationship among the 4 Notch receptors in the
regulation of gene expression and cell function remain
elusive. Previous studies have demonstrated that the
activation of one Notch receptor can repress or induce the
other Notch signaling [41, 42]. Moreover, each of 4 Notch
receptors may have distinctly selective target sequence
[43, 44] and play a differential biological function.
Transcription factor Hes-1, a key repressor of its own

Western blot and compared with internal control β-actin. Control cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO. Each experiment was repeated three
times. (A) The expression of Notch2. (B) The expression of Hes-1.

promoter by a negative feedback loop, has a very short
half-life [45]. Consequently, the levels of Hes-1 might not
directly reflect the activation of Notch2 receptor.
From what has been discussed above, ACGs
treatment in GC cells in vitro resulted in enhanced cell
proliferation inhibition, apoptosis, G0/G1 arrest and Notch2
expression. In fact, each of these properties positively
correlated with the dose of ACGs, with more significant
effects at higher doses. Thus, ACGs stand a position that
might inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis and G0/
G1 arrest through directly or indirectly activating Notch2
expression. The combined treatment of GC with ACGs and
Notch2 signaling might exhibit synergistically therapeutic
potential than with higher doses of drug alone. It is also
possible not only to reduce drug adverse-effects, but also
to offer a novel and efficient therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of GC in the future. Further investigation is

needed to explore the mechanisms of which how ACGs
activates Notch2 signaling and how these changes lead to
increase cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis.
To our knowledge, this is the first investigation
regarding the effect of ACGs on GC cells through Notch2
signaling pathway. As demonstrated in the present study,
the molecular mechanism by which ACGs exerts its
inhibitory effects on GC cells through Notch2 will open
up a new era for developing novel therapeutic strategies.
More importantly, the up-regulation of Notch2 by ACGs
may be a potential strategy for chemosensitization of
metastatic GC cells to standard therapeutics. Nevertheless,
further in-depth studies together with preclinical animal
studies are needed to evaluate the cause-and-effect
relation of Notch2 regulation as well as ACGs-induced the
inhibition of cell growth and apoptosis in GC to determine
this novel hypothesis in future clinical trial.

Cell lines and culture

Annonaceous acetogenins

GC cell lines including AGS, MKN-28, MKN-45,
SGC-7901, MGC-803and normal gastric mucosa cell
GES-1 were cultured in high-glucose DMEM medium
(Hyclone, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(Zhejiang Tianhang Biological Technology Co., Ltd,
China), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL streptomycin
(in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 air at 37°C and
medium changed 24 h). Cells were passaged when the
confluence was about 90%. Cells were washed with PBS
(pH 7.2-7.4) and detached with 0.25% trypsin (Hyclone,
USA) for 2-3 min. Then the complete medium was used to
wash cells. Cells were used for experiments at logarithmic
growth phase.

Annonaceous acetogenins (ACGs) were kindly
provided by Dr. Xiangtao Wang (Institute of Medicinal
Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science
& Peking Union Medical College). The major components
of ACGs in this batch (No. 091) were list in Supplementary
Table 1 and K19 (43.124%) was the main component
named Bullatacin. HPLC finger print chromatogram was
determined at 210 nm for five batches (No.091, 092, 093,
094, 095) of total ACGs (Figure 8A) and K19 (Bullatacin)
was still the main component of all batches. The structure
of Bullatacin was shown in Figure 8B.

a microplate reader (Model 680, BIO-RAD, USA). The
average of the absorbance values of all wells was used
to calculate the inhibition rate of proliferation: inhibition
rate = (1-absorbance of experimental group/ absorbance of
control group) × 100%. Then the half maximal inhibitor
concentration (IC50) value was deduced.

Total RNA from cultured cells was extracted
using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) and was reversetranscribed by PrimeScript RT reagent Kit With
gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) according to
manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, real-time PCR was
performed for forty cycles to amplify N2ICD/Notchrelated genes (denaturation at 95°C for 5 s, annealing and
extension at 60°C for 34 s) in triplicate using PrimeScript
II Reverse Transcriptase (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) detected
y an ABI PRISM Stepone Plus Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems 7500, Foster City, CA,
United States) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
To test gene expression, relative quantitation of target gene
expression was determined by ΔΔCt (threshold cycle)
method. ∆Ct is the difference between Ct of target mRNA
and Ct of internal control for each group. The primers for
real-time PCR were listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Flow cytometry for cell apoptosis
To further explore the molecular mechanism
involved in ACGs inhibition of GC cells proliferation,
cell apoptosis was evaluated using FITC-Annexin V/PI
staining kit. After GC cells were treated 2.5 μg/ml, 5 μg/ml,
10 μg/ml ACGs respectively for 36h with 0.1% DMSO as
control, the cells were harvested and washed with PBS,
incubated with fluorescein-conjugated Annexin V and PI
for 15min and then analyzed by FACScan flow cytometer
equipped with the FACStation data management system
and cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA,
USA).

Flow cytometry for cell cycle

Cells (4000 cells/mL) were plated into a 96-well
plate with 100 μL suspension per well and cultured for
24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. ACGs powder was dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as 10 mM stock solution.
ACGs solution was sterilized with 0.22 μM membrane
filtration, aliquoted and then stored at -20°C. For use,
stock solution was thawed and diluted with high-glucose
DMEM in a series of final concentrations and the final
concentration of DMSO in the ACGs solution was <
1%. Solution with ACGs (0.15625 ug/ml~10 ug/ml)
was administered 100 μL per well to different wells with
0.1% DMSO as negative control group. Each of groups
comprised 3 sample wells. After ACGs was administered
in GC cells, cell viability was assessed with Cell Titer 96®
Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS,
Promega, USA). Briefly, 20 μL of Cell Titer 96® Aqueous
One Solution was added to each well. Following 1h in
culture, optical absorbance (A) at 490 nm was detected by

The flow cytometry was applied to investigate the
cell cycle perturbation of cells after ACGs treatment. In
brief, 1 × 105 cells were incubated with DMEM medium
without FBS for 24 h and treated with indicated doses
(2.5 μg/mL, 5 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL) of ACGs, respectively.
Cells were then harvested, PBS washed amd fixed in icecold 70% ethanol, stored at 4°C overnight and spinned
down at 2000rpm for 5min next day. After being washed
once with PBS, cell pellets were collected and suspended
in 50 ug/ml PI reagent (5 ug/ml RNase, 50 ug/ml
propidium iodide, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton-X 100,
pH = 7.4) in dark at 4°C for 30min. The determination of
DNA content was measured by Beckman Coulter Flow
Cytometer (Miami,FL, US). The proportion of cells at
each phase in cell cycle (G0/G1, S, G2/M) was scored by
MultiCycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego,
CA, US). Apoptotic peak was also determined from the

The human Notch2-cDNA fragment was amplified
by using a forward primer 5′-ATTTGCGGCCGCGCCA
TGCGAAAGCGTAAGC-3′ as well as a reverse primer 5′CCGCTCGAGCGCATAAACCTGCATGTTGTTGTGT
-3′, confirmed by sequencing, and then digested by Not
I and Xho I-. The 2.3-kb fragment was purified using a
PrimeScriptTM One Step RT-PCR Kit Ver.2.0 (Takara,
Japan) and was ligated to a Not I –Xho I-digested pCMVTag4 vector DNA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, United
States) to construct Notch2/pCMV-Tag4. Positive clones
were further verified by Not I -Xho I digestion, sequencing
and PCR.

Statistical analysis
Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation
(x ± s). Statistical analysis were performed on SPSS17.0.
Pair-wise comparisons (SNK-q test method), single factor
analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and inter-group
mean values were used on above results. The analyses
were performed using two-sided tests. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Western blotting
Cell samples were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer
(Biosharp, China). Total protein extracts were prepared
and concentrations were measured using Bradford
protein assay kit. Then protein was separated on 10%
polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically
to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes which were
blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS for 1.5h with
the following antibodies: anti-Notch2(1:1000), antiHes-1(1:1000), anti-βactin(1:1000). were incubated at 4°C
with antibodies to Notch2, Hes-1, β-actin(1:1000, Abcam)
and followed by a secondary antibodies (1:500) at room
temperature. Washed with TBST three times was required
after each step. The bands of proteins were confirmed by
luminescent visualization using an ECL western blotting
Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and
quantified using the Quantity One software package (West
Berkeley, CA, USA).

The transfection of Notch2-small interfering
RNA (siRNA)

These authors declare that they have no competing
financial interests.

Notch2-siRNA
(sc-40135,
Santa
Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc) is the target-specific 19-25 nt siRNA
designed to knock down human Notch2 gene expression.
For siRNA transfection, GC cells were seeded into 6-well
plates to be grown to sub-confluency and transiently
transfected with negative control siRNA (sc-44236, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) or Notch2-siRNA at 50 nM for
24 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, San Diego,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
The next day, the medium was changed to fresh medium
with or without ACGs (5 μg/ml), and the cells were
continually cultured for 24 h. The proteins were extracted
from cells to measure Notch2 expression by western blot
and the cell viability was detected by MTS assay.
