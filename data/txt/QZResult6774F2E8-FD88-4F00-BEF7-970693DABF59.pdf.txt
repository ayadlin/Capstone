BACKGROUND. Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy improves survival in
muscle-invasive urothelial cancer, with MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin) considered the standard regimen. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin
(GC) has similar efficacy and less toxicity than MVAC in metastatic disease, but is
untested as neoadjuvant treatment.

METHODS. The authors retrospectively evaluated patients with muscle-invasive
urothelial carcinoma who received neoadjuvant GC before radical cystectomy
between November 2000 and December 2006 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center. Post-therapy pathological downstaging to either residual disease at cystectomy (pT0) or no residual muscle-invasion (<pT2, ie, pT0, pTIS, pT1), chemotherapy delivery, and disease-free survival were the endpoints of interest. For
comparison, similar endpoints were assessed in a historical cohort treated with
neoadjuvant MVAC.

RESULTS. Four cycles of neoadjuvant GC were given over 12 weeks (n 5 42).

Attempts to improve survival have focused on perioperative chemotherapy in an attempt to eradicate micrometastases. A meta-analysis
of over 3000 patients from neoadjuvant studies demonstrated a statistically superior survival benefit from neoadjuvant cisplatin-based
combination chemotherapy compared with surgery alone.2

a standard of care for treatment of patients with
metastatic cancer.3 This consensus is supported by
the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)-8710 trial
that randomized patients with stage T2-T4a bladder
cancer to receive either radical cystectomy alone or 3
cycles of MVAC followed by cystectomy.4 Diseasespecific survival was superior for the patients receiving neoadjuvant MVAC (hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-2.45; P 5 .002). There was a
trend toward superior overall survival (overall survival, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.00-1.76) for MVAC-treated
patients, with a 5-year survival of 57% compared
with 43% for patients treated with surgery alone (P 5
.06). Pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy also
yields useful prognostic information. In the SWOG
study, patients without residual disease (pT0) at cystectomy had an improved 5-year survival (85%) over
those who had residual disease, and patients in the
MVAC arm more frequently achieved pT0 status
(38% vs 15%; P < .001).4
Despite these data, neoadjuvant chemotherapy
has met resistance in the oncology community.5
Commonly cited reasons for lack of neoadjuvant
therapy is that MVAC toxicity is too severe for routine
clinical use,3 or that delaying cystectomy leads to
progression.6 Better-tolerated neoadjuvant chemotherapy may encourage greater utilization and potentially better outcomes. Cisplatin and gemcitabine
therapy (GC) demonstrates efficacy similar to MVAC
in terms of response and long-term survival for metastatic disease, but with far less toxicity.7,8 It therefore appears to be an excellent candidate for
neoadjuvant therapy, but little information is available regarding optimum drug delivery, pathological
response, and disease-free survival.9
Here, we report our experience with neoadjuvant
GC before cystectomy in patients with clinical stage
pT2-pT4a, N0 bladder cancer. Our main outcome of
interest was the rate of pathologic downstaging to either pT0 or <pT2, because these endpoints are
directly related to 5-year survival. To provide side-byside assessments of similar therapy, we describe this
experience in the context of a historical cohort of
patients treated with neoadjuvant MVAC at our institution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Characteristics
Approval was obtained from the institutional review
board (IRB) of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) to review patients who had been treated
at MSKCC with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, either
MVAC or GC. For GC neoadjuvant therapy, both the

pharmacy database and the institutional surgical
database were queried for all patients who received
this chemotherapy at MSKCC’s Sidney Kimmel Center for Prostate and Urologic Cancers. Then, medical
records of bladder cancer patients treated with GC
chemotherapy between November 2000 and December 2006 were reviewed. These records were crossvalidated with a surgical database of MSKCC patients
undergoing radical cystectomy. The IRB approval
allowed us to capture patients with muscle-invasive
disease seen at our center who met 2 criteria: 1) they
were referred to a MSKCC medical oncologist for
neoadjuvant therapy from an outside physician or an
MSKCC urologist; and, 2) they received their chemotherapy at our center with GC. During the time period of this study and continuing to the present, it
has been our practice in medical oncology to discuss
neoadjuvant cisplatin-based regimens such as MVAC
and GC with patients who have muscle-invasive disease and who are eligible for neoadjuvant therapy.
Despite this discussion, no patients were treated
with MVAC during the actual study period.
Patients referred to the Center for muscle-invasive urothelial cancer identified at transurethral
resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) had an independent MSKCC pathology review by dedicated
genitourinary pathologists. Patients were then clinically staged with either computed tomography (CT)
or magnetic resonance imaging, and a repeat examination under anesthesia (EUA) by a MSKCC urologist. A repeat TURBT was performed at the time of
EUA at the surgeon’s discretion. All patients underwent postchemotherapy radical cystectomy with
pelvic lymphadenectomy. Pathologic staging was
retrieved from the postoperative pathology reports.
The study included patients with locally advanced
disease clinically suspicious for tumor involving the
anterior vagina or prostate (clinical stage T4a seen in
3 patients), but excluded patients with cT4b disease.
Patients were excluded if there was clinical indication
of metastatic disease, eg, any adenopathy >2 cm on
pretreatment imaging, or if they had nontransitional
cell carcinoma. These ineligible patients with more
advanced disease were recommended to have 6
cycles of systemic chemotherapy, the choice of which
depended on renal function and medical comorbidities, interest in conventional or investigational therapy, and perceived tolerance of chemotherapy.
Patients were evaluated for chemotherapy by an
MSKCC medical oncologist, typically recommending
GC chemotherapy consisting of 4 cycles at 21-day
intervals over 12 weeks. The 21-day schedule was
based on the evidence of greater drug exposure of
both cisplatin and gemcitabine compared with the

Neoadjuvant GC in Bladder Cancer/Dash et al

original 28-day schedule, with completion of 4 rather
than 3 cycles in 12 weeks.10,11 Two 21-day schedules
predominated: standard single-dose and ‘‘split-dose’’
cisplatin. The former consisted of 4 cycles of GC
with cisplatin at 70 mg/m2 and gemcitabine at 1000
mg/m2 on Day 1, and gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2
on Day 8.12 Split-dose GC consisted of 4 cycles of
cisplatin at 35 mg/m2 and gemcitabine at 1000 mg/
m2 on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle.13 Two patients
received all chemotherapy at local institutions, and 2
received the initial cycle at our institution but completed therapy locally. Specific drug doses were not
retrievable in 1 patient, who was excluded from the
dose-intensity analysis.
For the comparator cohort, our institutional
database was accessed for a previously reported
cohort of 111 patients treated with 4 cycles of MVAC
chemotherapy at 28-day intervals before cystectomy.
These patients had heterogeneous surgical management.14 In that study, some patients refused cystectomy or deferred surgery until progression. We were
able to identify 54 of 111 who underwent either a
partial or a radical cystectomy after MVAC. Our institutional database did not include complete data
regarding the delivered chemotherapy doses and the
toxicity related to the MVAC chemotherapy regimen,
thus precluding a toxicity comparison with GC. However, it did contain the dates of initiating MVAC
chemotherapy, the number of cycles, the date and
extent of cystectomy, and pathological endpoints.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used for all endpoints of
interest, including pathological outcome and survival. Disease-free survival was chosen as the endpoint of interest because of the relatively short
follow-up in the GC cohort. Kaplan-Meier analysis
was used to describe disease-free survival, but the
GC and MVAC groups were not compared statistically. Disease-free survival was defined as the time
from first chemotherapy to the appearance of local
or regional disease, metastases, or death. Superficial
urothelial cancer recurrences were not considered
events. Drug intensity over time was analyzed for 4
planned cycles of therapy in 41 patients, as previously reported by our group15 and others.11 The
last 2 cycles in the 2 patients treated with 6 cycles
before cystectomy were not included in the calculations.

RESULTS
Forty-two patients received neoadjuvant GC, and 54
received MVAC. Both cohorts had similar clinical

characteristics at presentation (Table 1). The GC
cohort of 42 patients was selected from a surgical
database of over 700 patients undergoing cystectomy
for all stages of bladder cancer during the study period. Forty-one patients received GC on the 21-day
schedule; 26 patients received standard-dose cisplatin, and 15 patients received the split-dose cisplatin
schedule. One patient was treated with the original
28-day GC schedule (Days 1, 8, 15).7 Two patients
received 6 rather than the usual 4 cycles of GC.
Three patients received only 3 of 4 planned cycles.
Reasons for early discontinuation were worsening renal function, dehydration with hypotension, and progressive urinary symptoms without tumor response
(1 patient). No patient who received neoadjuvant GC
as a bimodal approach to treating muscle-invasive
bladder cancer refused cystectomy. Nine patients
were hospitalized during treatment. The most
common causes were thromboembolic disease (3
patients) followed by emesis (2 patients).
Pathologic outcomes at cystectomy were contrasted with prechemotherapy clinical stage for GC
patients. (Table 2). Twenty-six percent (95% CI, 1442) of patients achieved pT0 stage and 36% (95% CI,
21-52) had <pT2 disease at cystectomy. Achievement
of <pT2 status was achieved in 13 of 27 patients
treated with standard-dose cisplatin and 2 of 15
receiving split-dose cisplatin; the small numbers of
patients precluded statistical analysis (Table 3). All
patients underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy, with a
median lymph node count of 15. Lymph node positivity (despite normal postchemotherapy scans) was
seen in 2 pT2 patients and 9 pT3 patients. Although

at diagnosis, the cystectomy specimens showed 2
patients with residual squamous differentiation and
1 with residual small cell carcinoma.
Of the 54 patients treated with neoadjuvant
MVAC and surgery, 33 underwent radical cystectomy,
and 21 underwent partial cystectomy after chemotherapy. The rate at which pT0 stage and <pT2 were
achieved was 28% (95% CI, 16-42) and 35% (95% CI,
23-49), respectively. Because these patients underwent either radical or partial cystectomy based on
response to chemotherapy, 15% of 33 patients (95%
CI, 5-32) who underwent radical cystectomy were
pT0, but 48% of 21 patients (95% CI, 26-70) were
stage pT0 after partial cystectomy.
Disease-free survival was assessed in relation to
pathological outcome. At last follow-up in the GC
cohort, 15 patients had developed recurrent disease,
of whom 10 died of disease, and 5 were alive with
disease. Twenty-six patients were without evidence of
disease. One patient died of unknown causes 3½
years after initial chemotherapy. All 15 patients who
were <pT2 stage at cystectomy remained diseasefree at last follow-up, with a median follow-up of 30
months (interquartile range [IQR], 14-37). All 11
patients with positive lymph nodes at cystectomy

recurred; 7 subsequently died of disease. Disease-free
survival curves for the GC and MVAC cohorts are
presented in Figure 1. The median follow-up for survivors was 24.2 months in the GC cohort and 48.1
months in the MVAC cohort.
In evaluating the ability to deliver the planned
GC chemotherapy, we found that the median time
from the first day of GC chemotherapy to the last
date of therapy was 77 days (IQR, 70-89). The median time from the date of the last drug administration to the date of radical cystectomy was 57 days
(IQR, 46-76). The median interval from first chemotherapy treatment to radical cystectomy was 138
days (IQR, 123-155). No significant differences were
observed in the duration of therapy for patients treated with conventional cisplatin dosing (n 5 27) versus a split-dose schedule (n 5 15) (Table 4).
The median time from first MVAC chemotherapy
to radical cystectomy was 126 days (IQR, 89-175).
This interval was 96 days (IQR, 80-163) among the 33
patients who underwent radical cystectomy versus

Dose-intensity of GC chemotherapy was
reviewed for a planned 4 cycles to be given over 12
weeks. All 42 study patients received at least 3 cycles
of neoadjuvant GC, 39 (93%) received 4 cycles, and 2
received 6 cycles. The achieved dose intensity for cisplatin was 90% (IQR, 75-100), translating into a median weekly cisplatin dose of 21 mg/m2/week (IQR,
18-23). The achieved dose intensity for gemcitabine
was 90% (IQR, 68-100), with a median dose of 615
mg/m2/week (IQR, 542-667). Cisplatin dose intensity
was slightly greater in patients receiving split-dose
cisplatin (93%) compared with conventional singledose cisplatin (88%).

DISCUSSION
This is the first comprehensive study demonstrating
that neoadjuvant GC chemotherapy can downstage
muscle-invasive bladder tumors to a degree observed
with MVAC.14 The proportion of patients with complete eradication of tumor (pT0) was 26% for GC in
this study and 28% for patients treated with MVAC in
our prior study. Elimination of muscle-invasive disease (<pT2) was also similar: 36% for GC and 35%
for MVAC. Although these results do not come from
a direct random comparison, the similarity of
responses in primary bladder tumors across 1 institution’s studies is not surprising, given the comparable activity of these 2 regimens in metastatic
cancer.7,8
Pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy
yields useful prognostic information. In the SWOG
study, patients without residual disease (pT0) at cystectomy had an improved 5-year survival (85%) over
those who had residual disease, and patients in the
MVAC arm more frequently achieved pT0 status
(38% vs 15%; P < .001).4 However, even less complete
downstaging to non–muscle-invasive disease (<T2) is
still prognostic. One analysis reported that patients
with only residual ‘‘superficial’’ disease (including

2475

pT0, pTcis, pTa, and pT1) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy experienced a 75% survival at 5 years, compared with 20% for those with residual muscleinvasive or lymph node–positive disease.16 Thus,
chemotherapy downstaging defines chemotherapy efficacy and is a surrogate for long-term survival.
At first glance, the pathologic complete response
rate (pT0) of 26% achieved with GC in this study
appears inferior to other studies in which 38% of
patients were reported to have achieved pT0 with
MVAC and 32% with CMV (cisplatin, methotrexate,
and vinblastine).4,17 A closer look at these trials suggests that the pT0 rates across studies are actually
similar. In the neoadjuvant CMV trial, only 206 of
246 patients receiving chemotherapy had surgery; 35
had tumor progression precluding cystectomy.18
Thus, the reported pT0 rate of 32% drops to 27%
(95% CI, 21-33) if the results are evaluated using an
intent-to-treat analysis. SWOG-8710 reported a pT0
rate of 38% (48 of 126) in patients undergoing surgery,4 but that drops to 32% (48 of 150; 95 CI, 25-40)
using an intent-to-treat analysis when all 150
patients receiving MVAC are included. Thus, these
data suggest that GC chemotherapy has activity
within the range of other neoadjuvant regimens
known to improve survival.
Similar to prior observations with MVAC,4,14 GC
patients with an excellent pathological response to
therapy did well. All 15 GC patients achieving <pT2
disease in this study remain disease-free. Although
the median follow-up is shorter than the previously
reported MVAC series, these results support the concept that sustained benefit in disease-free survival
follows downstaging to <pT2, and is similar across
active cisplatin-based regimens.16 Moreover, no
patient failed to undergo cystectomy because of progression during 12 weeks of neoadjuvant GC chemotherapy.
Drug delivery with the 21-day schedule of GC
was excellent. Forty-two patients received at least 3
cycles, and 39 (93%) received 4 cycles. This delivery
appears to be better than MVAC and CMV as
reported in randomized trials. SWOG-8710 reported
that 87% of patients randomized to MVAC received 1
full cycle of chemotherapy.4 The CMV trial reported
that 20% of patients received less than the 3
intended cycles, and approximately half the patients
received the planned dose of cisplatin.18 These
observations suggest that the GC regimen, better tolerated than MVAC in advanced disease, is superior to
CMV in the delivered number of cycles and possibly
better than MVAC.
In this study, dose intensity was higher using a
21-day schedule for GC than the original 28-day

2476

schedule. The achieved dose intensity for cisplatin
was 90% (IQR, 75-100), translating into a median
weekly cisplatin dose of 21 mg/m2/week (IQR, 1823), higher than cisplatin delivery seen in a prior
MVAC study from our center.15 Our results for GC
are similar to other studies following the 21-day GC
regimen of 70 mg/m2/cycle and a delivered cisplatin
dose of 21 mg/m2/week in bladder cancer and 23
mg/m2/week in nonsmall lung cancer.10,12,19 The
achieved dose intensity for gemcitabine was 90%
(IQR, 68-100), with a median dose of 615 mg/m2/
week (IQR, 542-667), exceeding that observed for
the 28-day GC schedule, with observed medians of
593 to 600 mg/m2/week.7,11 We also report on 15
patients treated with split-dose cisplatin who
achieved a 93% dose intensity. Although fewer
responses in the primary tumors were seen after
split-dose cisplatin than single-dose cisplatin (2 of
15 vs 13 of 27), the numbers of patients are too
small to compare statistically or draw inferences.
More study of the regimens is indicated to address
whether or not there is a schedule impact on tumor
response.
The neoadjuvant GC regimen was generally well
tolerated, but there were 9 hospitalizations among
the 42 patients. Thromboembolic events accounted
for 1 third of the complications, 2 were incidental
emboli detected on routine postchemotherapy CTs,
and no complication was life-threatening. Thromboembolic complications have been reported to
occur in 13% of urothelial cancer patients on cisplatin-based chemotherapy, so the rate of 7% seen in
our study is consistent with that observed in the literature.20
There are limitations to our study. This is a retrospective study with selection biases, and a comparison between the GC and MVAC cohorts is
limited because of historic rather than randomized
comparisons. As with all retrospective analyses,
this study may have missed patients receiving
bimodality therapy or patients who did not
undergo cystectomy despite cross-validation of the
pharmacy and surgical datasets. Outside of hospitalization rates, we did not have complete chemotherapy toxicity data. However, this regimen has
previously been studied in urothelial and nonsmall
lung cancer, and the toxicity profile has been well
characterized.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that GC
for muscle-invasive bladder cancer produces definitive clinical activity in the neoadjuvant setting, with
a pathological complete response rate similar to that
of MVAC and an excellent disease-free survival in
responding patients. By using the 21-day schedule,

GC could be given for 4 cycles in 12 weeks, with a
higher dose intensity than the typical 28-day schedule. This well-tolerated regimen is worthy of more
extended use and evaluation in the neoadjuvant
setting.
