Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a major role in the response to injury or infection and is
involved in the immune response, inflammation, and hematopoiesis. Its deregulation impacts numerous disease states, including many types of cancer. Consequently, modulating IL-6 may be an innovative therapeutic strategy in several

diseases. A review of relevant published literature regarding IL-6 and its receptor
was performed. In addition, a review of the relevance of this cytokine system to
human illness, particularly in cancer, was undertaken. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine
that is involved in the physiology of virtually every organ system. Aberrant expression of this cytokine has been implicated in diverse human illnesses, most notably
inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, coronary artery and neurologic disease,
gestational problems, and neoplasms. In cancer, high levels of circulating IL-6 are
observed in almost every type of tumor studied and predict a poor outcome.
Furthermore, elevated IL-6 levels are associated strongly with several of the striking
phenotypic features of cancer. Several molecules have been developed recently
that target the biologic function of IL-6. Early results in the clinic suggest that this
strategy may have a significant salutary impact on diverse tumors. The field of
cytokine research has yielded a deep understanding of the fundamental role of IL6 and its receptor in health and disease. Therapeutic targeting of IL-6 and its receptor in cancer has strong biologic rationale, and there is preliminary evidence
suggesting that targeting of the IL-6 system may be beneficial in the treatment of
cancer. Cancer 2007;110:1911–28.  2007 American Cancer Society.

nterleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a major
role in the response to injury or infection and is involved in the
immune response, inflammation, and hematopoiesis.1 IL-6 exhibits
functional pleiotropy and redundancy and induces a variety of
responses from many cell types. IL-6 is a vital regulator of physiologic functions in diverse organ systems, including the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the
hepatic system, and others.1 In addition, its dysregulation impacts
numerous disease states, including many types of cancer. Consequently, modulating IL-6 may be an innovative therapeutic strategy
in these diseases. Herein, we review the role of IL-6 in malignancy.

IL-6 Gene Regulation
IL-6 was cloned first by Hirano et al., in 1986.2 IL-6 gene transcription is induced in many different normal tissues in response to stimuli, such as RNA and DNA virus infection, bacterial endotoxin,
lipopolysaccharide, and serum; the inflammatory cytokines tumor

Efficient induction of the IL-6 promoter requires
the interaction of several different transcription factors, including the CAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/
EBP) family members and nuclear factor kB (NF-kB).3
NF-IL6 (C/EBP-b) and NF-kB interact with each other
to synergistically up-regulate the IL-6 promoter,3 just
like NF-IL6 (C/EBP-b) and NF-IL6b (C/EBP-d).4
The IL-6 promoter is inhibited by p53 and the
retinoblastoma (Rb) gene product.5,6 The overexpression of IL-6 in many malignancies may occur
as a result of the loss of one of these negative regulators of transcription (Table 1).

IL-6 Receptors and Signaling
The IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) is a member of the Class I
cytokine receptor family (Table 2). Functional Class I
receptors contain high-affinity ligand-binding components and signal-transducing components, and are
thus multichain receptor complexes that often share
the signal-transducing component. There are 2 distinct components of the IL-6R. The ligand-binding
portion of the IL-6R is an 80-kDa molecule that
associates directly with IL-6.7 It exists in both a
membrane-bound and a soluble form.8 The signaltransducing component of the IL-6R complex is glycoprotein 130 (gp130), sometimes called the IL-6Rb
chain.7,9 Gp130 alone is unable to bind IL-6, but
plays an important role in the formation of high-affinity IL-6 binding sites and transduction of the IL-6

IL-6 binding induces an active tetramer and an
inactive hexamer at supraoptimal
concentrations of IL-6
sIL-6R can bind IL-6 and induce homodimers or
heterodimers of gp130
IL-6/sIL6R complexes act as agonist for cells

All members of the IL-6 family of cytokines share
the gp130 molecule as a critical component for signal transduction, which explains the functional redundancy of cytokines in the IL-6 family. A soluble
form of the IL-6Ra chain was purified first from
human urine.12 Soluble IL-6Ra (sIL-6Ra) binds to IL6 and forms a circulating complex. This soluble complex then binds cells that express gp130 and induces
signal transduction and gene expression in the recipient cell (Fig. 3). These complexes may be very important proinflammatory mediators13 and can confer
IL-6 responsiveness to cells that express gp130,
but not to cells that express IL-6Ra alone. This process is referred to as trans-signaling.14,15 In addition
to sIL-6Ra, soluble gp130 (sgp130) also exists in

intrinsic kinase domain, several investigators have
shown that Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) of the JAK family are associated constitutively with gp130 and are activated in response to IL-6
family members.16 Activation of these kinases, in turn,
leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the latent cytoplasmic transcription factors called signal transducers and
activators of transcription (STATs).17 The main STAT
activated by IL-6 and gp130 receptor complexes is
STAT318 (Table 2, Fig. 3). In addition to STAT3, the Ras
protein also is activated in response to IL-6. After Ras
activation, hyperphosphorylation of mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) occurs as well as an increase in
its serine/threonine kinase activity. MAPK then phosphorylates the NF-IL6 transcription factor (nuclear factor for IL-6) on serine 231 and threonine 235, a process
that is essential for DNA binding.19 NF-IL6 has a basic
leucine zipper motif and is a member of the C/EBP
family of transcription factors. NF-IL6 binds and activates the promoter regions of various acute-phase protein genes in the liver.1 Thus, when IL-6 binds to a cell
through IL-6Ra/gp130 complexes, a series of events
takes place that leads to the activation of STATs and
NF-IL6, switching on target genes.

associated constitutively with gp130 and are activated in response to IL-6
family members. The Ras protein also is activated in response to IL-6, which
leads to hyperphosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and
activation of the nuclear factor for IL6 (NF-IL6) transcription factor.

A variety of events takes place downstream of
gp130 activation by ligand, including activation of
cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and modification of
transcription factors (Fig. 3). Although gp130 has no

Biologic Activities of IL-6
IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that affects virtually every organ system, most notably the immune
system. IL-6 is a potent and essential factor for the
normal development and function of both T and B
lymphocytes1 and has broad actions on cells of the
hematopoietic system. IL-6 also up-regulates the
multidrug resistance 1 (MDR-1) gene through activation of NF-IL6, which, in turn, transactivates the
MDR-1 gene through a Y-box motif.20
IL-6 is also a central regulator of the acute-phase
response in the liver and regulates fever. Human diseases that involve prolonged inflammation frequently
exhibit cachexia and loss of muscle mass, and IL-6
appears to be the mediator of these processes as
well.21 IL-6 may mediate loss of adipose tissue in part
by enhancing endogenous corticosteroid secretion. It
is noteworthy that high circulating levels of IL-6 also
have been linked to insulin resistance, high body mass
index, and obesity.22 Human adipose tissue expresses
IL-6, and adipocytes in culture express IL-6 constitutively.23 IL-6 also exerts its effects on the central nervous system, where it is known that cytokines from the
IL-6 family regulate glial cell activation.24

advanced age, such as decreased lean body mass,
low-grade anemia, lymphoproliferative disorders,
multiple myeloma, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer disease.34,35 Individuals with these pathologies exhibit
elevated serum IL-6 levels compared with the levels
in normal controls.
IL-6 contributes to the destruction of the joints
in rheumatoid arthritis25 and causes resorption of
osteoclasts in osteoporosis.33 Estrogen, which helps
prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women,
inhibits IL-6 gene expression. When estrogen is
removed, the repression of IL-6 expression is lost,
and elevated serum levels of IL-6 result in bone
resorption, which results in loss of bone mass.
It also is believed that IL-6 is involved in the pathology of several neurologic disorders, including
multiple sclerosis (MS). Patients with MS exhibit
higher mean levels of IL-6 in their cerebrospinal fluid
than normal controls.36 IL-6 may play a role in the
pathology of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis,
Alzheimer disease,35 Parkinson disease,37 and certain
dementias.35,37 A specific gene polymorphism in the
IL-6 promoter region (2174 CC genotype) is associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer
disease, particularly in women.38

IL-6 and Cancer
An elevated serum IL-6 level has been correlated
with an adverse prognosis in patients with several
different types of cancer, including but not limited to
multiple myeloma,39 lymphoma,40 ovarian cancer,41,42 prostate cancer,43 and metastatic renal cell
carcinoma.44 Because of the role of IL-6 in the acutephase response in the liver and in the regulation of
the systemic immune response, it is believed that
high serum levels of the cytokine contribute to
weight loss, night sweats, fever, and other paraneoplastic symptoms.45 IL-6 in the serum or plasma
from patients may be present in several different
forms, including high-molecular-weight complexes
that contain sIL-6R, anti-IL-6 antibodies, or small
chaperone proteins.46 To date, a role for IL-6 has
been implicated in almost every cancer examined
(Table 4).
Breast Cancer
Evidence suggests that IL-6 may have an inhibitory
effect on the growth of breast cancer cell lines, yet it
promotes the development of metastases. Singlenucleotide polymorphisms in the IL-6 promoter,
particularly the 2174 G/C polymorphism, have been
associated with an aggressive breast cancer pheno-

1915

type47 and with breast cancer susceptibility and
prognosis.48
For example, inflammatory breast cancer has a
higher metastatic potential than noninflammatory
breast cancer.49 IL-6 up-regulates proangiogenic
molecules, including vascular endothelial cell growth
factor (VEGF). Over-expression of IL-6 may contribute to angiogenesis and metastasis in breast cancer,
thereby contributing to metastatic potential.50 Moreover, IL-6 may be involved in stimulating aromatase
activity and, thus, in the conversion of estrogen precursors to estrogen.

Preclinical studies
IL-6 inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells either
alone or in combination with TNF-a and IL-1.51
Growth inhibition by IL-6 in breast cancer cell lines
like MCF-7 may be mediated through blocking key
intracellular signaling events after the activation of
the insulin-like growth factor-I tyrosine kinase receptor.52 IL-6 also may be involved in inducing migration and metastases, and it may confer multidrug
resistance in breast cancer cells.53 By using a nude
mouse model, Selander et al., demonstrated that
MDA-231 breast cancer cells with a dominant-negative gp130 protein (DN gp130) had markedly
decreased engraftment, size, and metastasis compared with control cells.54 Marked angiogenesis was
absent in tumors from DN gp130 animals. DN gp130
protein also inhibited the constitutive activation of
STAT3 in breast cancer cells.
In addition, IL-6 may impact estrogen regulation
through a variety of intermediaries, including aromatase. IL-6 appears to activate several enzyme complexes that are involved in the synthesis of estrogens.
IL-6 and sIL-6R have been identified as potent aromatase-stimulating factors.55 Prostaglandin E2, which
is believed to increase aromatase expression through
several aromatase promoters, may act in part by stimulating IL-6 production in fibroblasts.55 Estrone is
formed by aromatase; however, to reach its full biologic potency, it must be reduced to estradiol. IL-6 and
TNF-a may be key regulators in stimulating the conversion of estrone to estradiol.
Translational studies
High levels of IL-6 are associated with metastatic
breast cancer and correlated with poor survival in
multivariate analysis.56 Studies of patients with hormone-refractory breast cancer have indicated a
strong correlation between high serum IL-6 levels
and a poor prognosis. High levels of IL-6 in patients
with metastatic breast cancer, compared with
patients who had locoregional disease, confirmed a

1916

CANCER

correlation with poor survival in multivariate analysis.50,56 IL-6 also is more abundant in high-grade
tumors and was correlated inversely with estrogen
receptor expression.57 Other investigators have
demonstrated a reduction in the levels of IL-6 or sIL6Rs in patients who responded to therapy.58

Colorectal Cancer and Other Gastrointestinal Tumors
Preclinical studies
IL-6 exhibited growth-stimulatory effects on a panel of
colon cancer cell lines.59 The addition of IL-1 was
synergistic; however, TGF-b1 had the opposite effect.
The balance of these cytokines in this tumor may play
a more important role than any single cytokine. In
another study, the IL-6 growth-stimulating effect was
more pronounced in metastatic colon cancer cell
lines.60 The growth-stimulating effect of IL-6 may be
obviated by the immune-stimulating effect of IL-6. For
instance, Rabau et al.61 observed that mice treated
with human recombinant IL-6 had reduced implantation and growth of human colorectal cancer cell lines
accompanied by increased infiltration of lymphocytes
into the tumor site. Inflammatory bowel disease, like
colon cancer, exhibits increased IL-6 expression, which
results in increased expression and nuclear translocation of STAT3. This IL-6 production leads to the induction of antiapoptotic genes in T cells at the site,
resulting in the perpetuation of chronic inflammation
of the colon. It was suggested in recent studies that
inflammation and IL-6/sIL-6R expression play a role
in the pathogenesis of colon cancer.15,62
In cholangiocarcinoma cells, increased IL-6 and
myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) expression is a result
of silencing of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3
(SOC-3) gene by methylation. SOCS-3 normally suppresses the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway by using a
negative feedback loop.63 IL-6 also may enhance
cholangiocyte survival by altering microRNAs,
including let-7a, which contributes to the constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 by a mechanism that
involves the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF) gene.64
Translational correlations
In patients with gastrointestinal malignancies, IL-6
levels have been correlated with overall survival, time to
tumor progression, tumor burden, metastatic disease,
and malnourishment but were not an independent
prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.15,65
Glioma
IL-6 expression in glioma has been correlated with
tumor grade and vascularity.66,67 In a recent study,

IL-6 gene amplification was observed in patients
with glioblastoma who had the most malignant
tumors, and IL-6 gene amplification was associated
with decreased survival.66 IL-6 also can serve as an
autocrine growth factor and seems to be required for
glioma and spontaneous astrocytoma development
in mouse models.68 Although it remains unknown
exactly how IL-6 contributes to the malignant progression of gliomas, IL-6 up-regulates VEGF promoter activity and VEGF protein secretion in
glioblastoma cells through activation of STAT3.69 The
VEGF promoter does not contain STAT3 binding
sites. STAT3 appears to bind sp1 and forms a complex with sp1 and sp3 proteins to bind sequences at
280 to 250 in the VEGF promoter to activate transcription of the gene.69 Up-regulation of VEGF in
these cells may lead to increased angiogenesis and
metastasis. Further study is required to define the
role of IL-6 in glioma.

Leukemia
In the setting of leukemias, IL-6 appears to have
both stimulatory and suppressive effects.
Preclinical studies
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells
can express and secrete IL-6.70 IL-6 functions in
these cells as a stimulatory molecule and also is
involved in B-cell differentiation. IL-6 also inhibits
TNF-induced proliferation of B-CLL.
Translational studies
IL-6 levels are elevated in a significant subset of
patients with CLL, and these levels correlate with a
poor prognosis.71 Serum levels of IL-6 and sIL-6R
also are indicators of CLL activity. In addition, IL-6
levels are elevated in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. In this disease, both inhibitory and
stimulatory effects on clonogenic blast growth have
been reported.72
Lung Cancer
Unlike the situation in most other tumor types, IL-6
has an inhibitory effect on the growth of lung cancer.
The clinical correlative data suggest more of a role in
the inflammatory response, although some studies
suggest a correlation between IL-6 levels and disease
status.
Preclinical studies
Transfection of the IL-6 gene into Lewis lung carcinoma cells results in growth arrest. Moreover, antiIL-6 antibody has a growth-accelerating effect. Conversely, intracellular IL-6 may cause proliferation in a

select group of nonsmall cell lung cancer cell lines.
Thus, there may be 2 subtypes of lung cancer: an IL6-dependent type and an IL-6-independent type.73

Translational correlations
Patients with lung cancer have increased levels of
serum IL-6 that correlate with decreased survival and
weight loss.74 Katsumata et al., examined a large
cohort of patients with untreated primary lung cancer and observed increased levels of serum IL-6,
especially in patients who had large cell carcinoma
versus patients with other lung cancer types. Patients
who had high levels of IL-6 had significantly
decreased survival.75 Among patients with nonsmall
cell lung cancer who had significant weight loss
(>5%), there were increases in all of the inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, platelets,
and IL-6.74 Other investigators have reported elevated levels of IL-6 in the malignant pleural fluid
from patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer and a
correlation between IL-6 levels and weight loss.21,76
Lymphoma and Castleman Disease
Correlations between IL-6 and Hodgkin disease, nonHodgkin lymphomas, and lymphoproliferative diseases, such as Castleman disease, have been well
documented.40,45,77 Furthermore, recent clinical studies demonstrated that antitumor effects were
obtained through IL-6 inhibition.
Preclinical studies
Hodgkin disease-derived cell lines express both IL-6
and its receptor. Moreover, IL-6 messenger RNA
(mRNA) is expressed by Reed-Sternberg cells in
approximately 80% of patients examined.78 Proliferation of certain B-cell- and T-cell-derived human lymphoma cell lines from non-Hodgkin lymphomas can
be stimulated by autocrine-produced IL-6.79 IL-6
mRNA and protein expression also have been detected
by immunohistochemistry in malignant lymphoma
cells. Autoimmune deficiency syndrome-derived diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells are sensitive to
growth inhibition by TGF-b; however, IL-6 production
in these cells may overcome this inhibition by stimulating proliferative and antiapoptotic signals, particularly through the activation of STAT3.80
Transgenic mouse studies suggest that IL-6 overexpression is involved in lymphoproliferative disorders, such as Castleman disease.77 Patients may succumb to infections, or their disease may evolve to a
more aggressive form. An underlying etiology of multicentric Castleman disease is Kaposi sarcoma-associated human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), particularly in

1917

patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It has been established that HHV-8
encodes a viral IL-6, which activates gp130 directly
and promotes hematopoiesis and angiogenesis.81 The
signaling cascades of human IL-6 and viral IL-6 are
identical.81

Translational studies
In diffuse large cell lymphoma, serum levels of IL-6
can be used as a prognostic indicator of complete
response, failure-free survival, and overall survival.40,82 Likewise, serum IL-6 levels in Hodgkin disease correlate with survival and B symptoms.45,83
Moreover, high serum levels of IL-6 in indolent lymphoma correlate with shorter failure-free survival.84
In patients with plasma cell-type Castleman disease,
IL-6 is produced by the affected lymph nodes, and
serum IL-6 levels correlate positively with clinical
abnormalities.85
Clinical studies
In 1994, 11 HIV-1-positive patients with lymphoma
were treated with the murine anti-IL-6 monoclonal
antibody (MoAb), BE-8. There was 1 partial remission, and 5 patients had clinically stable disease. The
most dramatic effect in the study, however, was the
alleviation of fever and cachexia.86
Anti-IL-6 therapy in the treatment of B-lymphoproliferative disorders in 12 transplantation patients
whose conditions were refractory to reducing immunosuppression also was evaluated.87 In that study, 10
patients completed treatment with BE-8, and 2
patients discontinued treatment because of disease
progression. All patients tolerated the therapy without major side effects. Eight patients achieved a
response, with 5 patients achieving complete remission and 3 patients achieving partial remission.
Many of these responses were ongoing at 9 to 12
months.
Nishimoto et al.,88,89 successfully used a humanized anti-IL-6R antibody (MRA) to treat Castleman
disease. This molecule has been approved in Japan
as a therapy for Castleman disease (ACTEMRA 200
for intravenous infusion). In addition, a chimeric
anti-IL-6 antibody (CNTO 328) is in trial in the
United States and has demonstrated activity in lymphoma and Castleman disease.90,91

Melanoma
Preclinical studies
It appears that early-stage melanomas are inhibited
by IL-6, whereas metastatic melanoma cell lines

1918

CANCER

seem to be resistant to IL-6 growth inhibition.92
Thus, in melanoma, IL-6 is not a growth factor but a
growth inhibitor. B16 melanoma cells enter into
growth arrest at G0/G1 phase after transfection with
IL-6.93 In contrast, metastatic melanoma cell lines
appear to be resistant to IL-6 growth inhibition.
These metastatic melanoma cells express IL-6 mRNA
constitutively and also secrete IL-6. Why are they resistant to IL-6 growth inhibition? One possibility is
high levels of SOCS expression. The human melanoma cell line 1286 is resistant to IL-6 and oncostatin M (OSM), although it expresses gp130 and OSM
receptors. JAKs, STAT1, and STAT3 are not activated
by cytokine treatment of these cells. When these
cells, which contain a high constitutive level of
SOCS3, were treated with short-interfering RNA
against SOCS3, the cells became susceptible to IL-6
and OSM growth inhibition, and STAT1 and STAT3
phosphorylation was enhanced dramatically.94
In mouse models, administration of the combination of IL-6 and sIL-6R reduced metastases.95 This
is in contrast to IL-6 alone, which seems to increase
the metastatic potential of melanoma cell lines in
murine models.96 Therefore, the role of IL-6 and its
receptor in this malignancy is complex.

Translational studies
Patients with both localized and metastatic melanoma demonstrated significantly higher levels of serum IL-6 compared with normal controls, and these
high levels were correlated with a shorter time to tumor progression and resistance to biochemotherapy.97 It is noteworthy that an inverse correlation
between soluble epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and IL-6 was observed in patients with metastatic melanoma, and circulating IL-6 levels were
predictive of survival.98
Multiple Myeloma
One of the most studied tumor types in relation to
IL-6 is multiple myeloma. Preclinical, translational
correlations and early Phase I studies suggest
that blocking IL-6 production may lead to effective
therapy.
Preclinical studies
Human myeloma cell lines proliferate in response to
IL-6.39 Both paracrine and autocrine mechanisms
may be operative. The predominant source of IL-6
through the paracrine mechanism is bone marrow
stromal cells. The interaction between IL-6, other
cytokines, and sIL-6R within this milieu appears to
contribute to the pathogenic potential of IL-6. IL-1,

for example, triggers the production of IL-6. IFN-a
stimulates production of IL-6 through an autocrine
loop.99 IL-8 acts to attract the circulating malignant
plasma cell precursors into the IL-6-rich bone marrow.100 IL-10 may work in conjunction with IL-6 to
sensitize myeloma cells to other gp130 cytokine family members.101 sIL-6R binds to IL-6 and forms a
complex that activates the gp130 signal-transducer
chain, thus producing a 10-fold increase in the sensitivity of human IL-6-dependent cell lines.102,103
Whether IL-6 induces proliferation of multiple myeloma cells also may depend on the specific cellular
context, including CD45 expression.104
How IL-6 promotes downstream proliferation or
survival of multiple myeloma cells remains to be
fully elucidated. However, several investigators have
suggested that IL-6 promotes cell survival through
activation of STAT3 and up-regulation of proteins of
the bcl-2 family, eg, Mcl-1 and bcl-xl.105 It is noteworthy that Bcl-xl may contribute to chemotherapy
resistance in myeloma cell lines.106 IL-6 also may upregulate VEGF, thus stimulating angiogenesis in bone
marrow infiltrated by myeloma cells. Conversely, it
also has been noted that VEGF can induce expression of IL-6, suggesting that there is an IL-6/VEGF
feedback loop in the progression of myeloma.107 A
new receptor inhibitor (NRI) that was developed by
Yoshio-Hoshino et al., has been proven effective
against IL-6-dependent multiple myeloma in the
mouse. This new molecule is discussed in more
detail below.108

Translational correlations
Stage, progression of disease, disease parameters,
and survival all appear to have strong correlations
with IL-6 levels. Patients who have advanced-stage
disease (stage II/III), compared with patients who
have stage I disease or disease in a plateau stage,
have significantly higher levels of IL-6.109 Conventional prognostic parameters in myeloma eg, lactate
dehydrogenase, serum b2 microglobulin, and bone
marrow plasmacytosis, also have been correlated
strongly with high IL-6 levels.110 Furthermore, survival has been correlated with levels of both IL-6 and
sIL-6R,39,111 and resistance to chemotherapy reportedly was associated with high sIL-6R levels at the
time of diagnosis.111
Clinical studies
Dexamethasone, a commonly used therapy in myeloma, inhibits the production of IL-6 and IL-6R
gene expression in vitro. Bortezamib, the recently
approved proteasome inhibitor, may suppress multi-

IL-6 Treatment Strategies in Cancer/Hong et al.

ple myeloma progression by abrogating IL-6mediated signaling cascades.112
In 1 study, 10 patients with advanced and progressive multiple myeloma were treated with the BE8 antibody (murine antihuman IL-6 antibody). Three
patients showed marked inhibition of plasmablastic
proliferation, but none showed remission or
improvement based on standard clinical criteria113;
however, hypercalcemia and fever were reduced. In
another study, BE-8 was combined with dexamethasone and high-dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Thirteen of 16
refractory patients exhibited some clinical response,
with a complete response observed in 6 patients.114
In a similar study, BE-8 was given 1 day before dexamethasone therapy and was continued through highdose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation until hematologic recovery. BE-8 neutralized
IL-6 activity, as evidenced by decreased C-reactive
protein and significant reductions in mucositis and
fever. A median event-free survival of 35 months and
an overall survival rate of 68.2% at 5 years were
reported.115

Ovarian Cancer
Preclinical studies
Initial evidence for growth-stimulating effects of IL-6
in ovarian cancer came from incubating ovarian cancer cell lines with supernatant derived from human
peripheral blood monocytes. Several cell types that
have been associated with ovarian cancer, including
tumor-associated macrophages and human peritoneal mesothelial cells, have high levels of IL-6 secretion, suggesting a possible paracrine effect. However,
constitutive production of IL-6 also was noted from
ovarian cancer cell lines themselves, consistent with
an autocrine effect.116
Several studies have explored how IL-6 is regulated in ovarian cancer cell lines. Mutations of p53
have been implicated. In results that were analogous
to those reported for renal cell cancer, wild-type p53
protein inhibited IL-6 promoter activity in ovarian
carcinoma cell lines; and, conversely, p53 mutants
appeared to induce IL-6 promoter activity (through
alteration of AP-1 binding activity).117 Another possible mechanism that contributes to IL-6 over-expression in ovarian cancer may be the methylation of
SOCS proteins. SOCS1 and SOCS2, but not SOCS 3,
suppress the growth of ovarian and breast cancer cell
lines.118 The aberrant methylation of the SOCS1 and
SOCS2 genes correlated with transcriptional silencing
of these genes. Thus, hypermethylation and silencing
of specific SOCS genes may augment cytokine

1919

responsiveness, thereby contributing to oncogenesis.118 Evidence also has emerged to suggest that IL6 may mediate its downstream effects in ovarian
cancer through the JAK/STAT3-signal-transduction
cascade and also may be involved in hormone-stimulated growth of these cells.119 More recent studies
have suggested that autocrine IL-6 produced by ovarian cancer cell lines results in higher levels of phosphorylated nuclear STAT3. It is believed that STAT3
up-regulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 in these
cells, thus contributing to angiogenesis and metastasis.120 In mice, STAT3 expression was associated with
high levels of HER-2/neu, EGFR, and Ki-67; and
high nuclear expression was linked with poor overall
survival.121

Translational studies
Higher levels of IL-6 in either ascitic fluid or serum
appear to correlate with stage, tumor progression,
and reactive thrombocytosis. High serum levels of
IL-6 also correlate with bulky disease and progression of disease.41 Correlations between IL-6 levels
and survival have been inconsistent.41,42,122 It is noteworthy that patients who had high levels of IL-6 in
ascitic fluid had increased platelet counts and low
hemoglobin levels.122 Differences in the 2174 promoter region of the IL-6 gene also may help determine survival. The IL-6 2174 GG genotype was
associated significantly with longer overall survival in
women with ovarian cancer.123

Pancreatic Cancer
Preclinical studies
Preclinical and clinical investigations of IL-6 suggest
that this molecule has properties that are consistent
with a causative role in the phenotypic presentation
of pancreatic cancer, ie, progressive debilitation and
weight loss. For instance, IL-6 can induce cachexia
and fever, and its presence is highly correlated with
B symptoms (fever, weight loss) in patients with
recurrent lymphomas.45 Furthermore, in clinical studies in which recombinant human IL-6 has been
administered to patients, it has been demonstrated
that this molecule increases C-reactive protein levels
and decreases serum albumin levels.124 Human pancreatic carcinoma cells secrete IL-6, IL-10, and TGFb in culture. These cytokines work together to inhibit
immature monocyte-derived dendritic cell proliferation, and they down-regulate the expression of costimulatory molecules, such as CD40, CD80, and
human leukocyte antigen DR. These dendritic cells
are unable to mount a proper mixed lymphocyte
response in culture. Thus, cytokines secreted by pan-

1920

CANCER

November 1, 2007 / Volume 110 / Number 9

creatic carcinoma cells can inhibit the immune
response to the tumor.125 IL-6 and IL-1 also can upregulate VEGF expression in CAPAN-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells, suggesting a role for IL-6 in metastasis
and disease progression.126

Translational studies
Recently, we studied circulating levels of cytokines in
51 patients with pancreatic cancer127 who had circulating levels of IL-6 that were significantly higher
than the levels in normal controls (P < .05). Patients
with IL-6 levels >5.2 pg/mL had significantly lower
survival rates than patients with lower IL-6 levels
(P < .05). Higher IL-6 levels were associated with a
poor performance status and/or weight loss. In multivariate analysis, only a tumor classification of T4
and high IL-6 levels were selected as independent
prognostic factors for poor survival. In another study,
higher serum levels of IL-6 were observed in patients
who had pancreatic cancer compared with the levels
observed in patients who had gastric cancer.128 In
addition, cytokine profiles of pancreatic carcinoma
cell lines and of surgical specimens, including
tumoral versus nontumoral pancreatic tissue, indicated the over-expression of IL-6 in tumoral tissue,
and low circulating levels of IL-6 were associated
with increased survival.125
Prostate Cancer
Several investigators have suggested the involvement
of IL-6 in proliferation, metastases, growth of metastases in bone, androgen-independence, and the overall prognosis and survival of patients with prostate
cancer.
Preclinical studies
In vitro and immunohistochemical studies have
demonstrated that IL-6 and IL-6R are expressed or
secreted from prostate tissue and cell lines and that
IL-6 acts as an autocrine growth factor for this disease and blocks apoptotic signals from chemotherapeutic agents.129 The survival signal initiated by
autocrine IL-6 production in prostate cancer may be
mediated in part by the myeloid cell leukemia-1
(mcl-1) protein, an antiapoptotic member of the bcl2 family of proteins. Treatment of LNCap-IL-6-positive cells, a model for advanced prostate cancer, with
CNTO 328 anti-IL-6 antibody resulted in the downregulation of mcl-1 protein levels and the induction
of apoptosis.130 Prostate cancer cell lines that produce autocrine IL-6 include androgen-independent
and androgen-dependent cell lines.129 Although the
effect of IL-6 on androgen-dependent cell line

growth is controversial,131 a recent study provided
evidence supporting the contribution of IL-6 to the
development of androgen-independence. An androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line, LuCaP, was
transplanted into nude mice that were castrated and
treated with CNTO 328 (an IL-6 neutralizing antibody) for 18 weeks. Mice that were treated with
CNTO 328 had increased survival and inhibition of
tumor growth compared with mice that were treated
with an isotype-matched control antibody. In addition, treatment of the mice with CNTO 328 prevented LuCaP tumors in orchiectomized mice
(removal of the testes and, thus, androgens) from
becoming androgen-independent tumors.132 In a
separate study, treatment of LNCaP-IL-6-positive
cells with CNTO 328 resulted in a statistically significant inhibition of cell viability, in decreased protein
levels of bcl-2, and in the phosphorylation of the
extracellular regulated kinase 1 (ERK1)/ERK2 MAP kinases.133
Other IL-6 neutralizing agents have been studied
in prostate cancer, including Sant7, which is a modified IL-6 molecule that binds the IL-6R subunit and
blocks gp130 signaling while enhancing the sensitivity of the cells to etoposide and cisplatin.134 Tkip, a
novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is a peptide mimetic of SOCS1, inhibits proliferation of DU145 and
LNCaP cell lines, possibly by blocking constitutive
and IL-6-induced activation of STAT3, resulting in
reduced levels of cyclin D1 and, thus, failure to enter
the S-phase of the cell cycle.135

Translational correlations
Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates that IL6 and its receptor are expressed in both premalignant
and malignant prostate cells. Although there is
expression of IL-6 in the benign basal cells of the
prostate tissue, there is a marked increase in staining
in the intraluminal cells of malignant tissue. Clinical
correlations in patients with prostate cancer have
demonstrated associations between IL-6 levels and
hormone-refractory disease, bony metastases, and
disease aggressiveness.43,136 High IL-6 levels correlate
with both prostate cancer morbidity, including
cachexia, and mortality.45,136-138
Renal Cell Carcinoma
The importance of IL-6 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
has been well documented, and clinical studies targeting this molecule have begun.
Preclinical studies
Freshly isolated RCC tissues secrete active IL-6 and
express IL-6 mRNA. Furthermore, IL-6 is an auto-

IL-6 Treatment Strategies in Cancer/Hong et al.

crine growth factor for some RCC cell lines.139 Both
fresh RCC tissue and RCC cell lines have much
higher IL-6 expression than normal renal epithelium.140 This increase in IL-6 expression in RCC may
reflect a disruption of normal IL-6 gene regulation
that, in some cases, may relate to mutation in the
p53 tumor suppressor gene, because the presence of
wild-type p53 decreases levels of IL-6 expression.5,6
Recently, a novel spliced isoform of IL-6 mRNA
(truncated or tIL-6) with IL-6-inhibitory activity was
described in RCC.141
In addition to the autocrine effects of IL-6, IL-6
and VEGF release by RCC tumor cells may inhibit
antitumor cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses to RCC.
Irradiated RCC tumor antigen-expressing dendritic
cells failed to enhance the cytotoxic activity of autologous lymphocytes in 7 of 13 assays because of high
levels of IL-6 and VEGF produced by the tumor cells.
When tumor cells released low levels of IL-6, tumor
antigen-expressing
dendritic
cells
efficiently
enhanced CTL activity.142 Thus, IL-6 and VEGF
release by RCC may inhibit host immune responses
to the tumor.

Translational correlations
High circulating levels of IL-6 correlate with the presence of metastatic disease.143 High IL-6 levels predict a poor prognosis, and analysis has confirmed
that there is a linear correlation between stage,
grade, and tumor size and IL-6 levels.143 In a recent
study, it was demonstrated that IL-6, IL-10, and heatshock protein 90 were useful markers for the development and progression of RCC.144
Clinical trials
Studies examining the antitumor effect of human
recombinant IL-6 in RCC reported no objective clinical responses, and common side effects included
fever, fatigue, arthralgias, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis.145
BE-8, the murine MoAb against IL-6, was studied
in RCC.146 Three of 18 patients had a minor
response, and an additional 2 patients experienced
slight tumor reduction in the liver and lung. Reduction in C-reactive protein levels correlated with
response. It is noteworthy that all 18 patients had an
improvement in performance status associated with
a decrease in analgesic intake and normalization of
chronic fever. Toxicity was minimal.
Thus, anti-IL-6 therapy may have salutary effects
on secondary symptoms as well as antitumor activity
in RCC. Further studies with humanized antibody are
indicated.

1921

Cachexia and Performance Status
Weight loss is a hallmark of cancer, and it contributes significantly to cancer morbidity and mortality.
Interventions are poorly explored. Several studies
suggest
that
inhibiting
IL-6
may
alleviate
cachexia.147–149 IL-6 cytokine expression in the
spleen preceded the development of cachexia in
mice that were injected with a lung carcinoma cell
line.148 More profoundly, IL-6 gene knockout tumorbearing mice had attenuated cachexia. No attenuation was observed in mice that lacked host-derived
IL-12, IFN-g, or TNF-a.149
Serum IL-6 levels correlate with poor nutritional
status in patients with lung cancer.150 In addition,
levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-8 were elevated significantly in a group of cachectic patients with advanced
prostate cancer compared with noncachectic
patients.43,151 In pancreatic cancer, high IL-6 levels
correlate with a poor performance status and, in
some studies, with weight loss.127 CNTO 328 antibody treatment inhibits human tumor-induced
cachexia in nude mice.152 Several interesting studies
that have targeted IL-6 in hopes of attaining tumor
responses have demonstrated attenuation of
cachexia. In HIV-1-positive patients with immunoblastic or polymorphic large cell lymphoma, anti-IL6 exhibited a clear effect on lymphoma-associated
fever and cachexia.86 Taken together, these observations suggest that further studies should be conducted looking specifically for improvement in
cachexia and performance status as primary endpoints.

Exploiting IL-6 as a Therapeutic Target
Preclinical and translational findings support a role
for IL-6 in diverse malignancies and provide a biologic rationale for targeted therapeutic investigations.
Various compounds antagonize IL-6 production,
including corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, estrogens, and cytokines. Targeted
biologic therapies include IL-6-conjugated toxins and
MoAbs directed against IL-6 and IL-6R.

Monoclonal Antibodies Against IL-6
Most of the human clinical experience in directly inhibiting IL-6 for cancer therapy has been with the
use of murine or humanized MoAbs. Initial investigations used the murine antibody BE-8, although a
murine monoclonal has its limitations. BE-8 cannot
efficiently block daily production of IL-6 levels >8 mg
per day. Moreover, the short half-life of BE-8 (3-4
days) may not suppress delayed IL-6 production

IL-6 indicates interleukin 6; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IL-6R, interleukin 6 receptor; sJIA, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; Akt, protein kinase B.
* CNTO 328 is a chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody; BE-8 is a murine anti-IL-6 mAb; and MRA is a humanized anti-IL-6R antibody.

without repeated dosing,153 which is problematic,
because murine antibodies generally are neutralized
by human antimouse responses. CNTO 328, a chimerized (humanized) IL-6 antibody, contains the
antigen-binding region of the human immunoglobulin G k (IgGk) immunoglobulin and the variable antigen-binding region of the murine anti-IL6 antibody.
This antibody has a long half-life of about 2 weeks
without significant immunogenicity and, thus, may
be more beneficial clinically.154
Preliminary evidence of BE-8 and CNTO 328
antitumor activity has been demonstrated in a series
of early trials in patients with lymphoma, myeloma,
RCC, and Castleman disease (Table 5). Some patients
also demonstrated improved performance status and
amelioration of fever. These antibodies are tolerated
well with little in the way of toxicity.88,90,91

Antibodies Against IL-6R
In a study of Castleman disease, a humanized antiIL-6R MoAb (MRA) resulted in the immediate relief
of fever and fatigue.89 Improvements also were noted
in anemia, inflammatory signs and symptoms, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. This is not surprising,
because it is believed that Castleman disease is
driven by IL-6. This antibody has been approved in
Japan the for treatment of this disorder.
Humanized recombinant anti-IL-6R MoAb (MRA)
was used recently to treat systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA).26 Antibody treatment in these
children resulted in a significant reduction in disease
activity in 10 of the 11 children studied. Febrile episodes, the number of actively arthritic joints, and
levels of acute-phase proteins all were reduced. The
antibody was safe and well tolerated, and it provided

greater clinical benefit than conventional corticosteroids. Another recombinant humanized anti-IL-6R
antibody called tocilizumab prevents the activation of
gp130 and has demonstrated efficacy in sJIA in Japan
and in inflammatory disorders in Spain.155,156 A new
IL-6R inhibitor (called NRI) generated by genetically
engineering tocilizumab has been developed recently.
NRI consists of the variable heavy and variable light
chain of tocilizumab in a single-chain fragment dimerized by fusing it to the Fc portion of IgG1. It is
encoded by a single gene and, thus, is more amenable
to an adenoviral delivery system.108

Other Strategies for Inhibiting IL-6
Improved efficacy in clearing IL-6 may be achieved
by using a cocktail of MoAbs targeting different epitopes of the cytokine. In vivo studies, which used
simultaneous treatment with 3 anti-IL-6 antibodies
binding 3 distinct epitopes, induced the uptake of
trimeric immune complexes by the liver and elimination of IL-6 from the central compartment.157
Several existing therapies may mediate their
effects by reducing IL-6 levels. Steroids are one such
group of compounds. PS-341 (Bortezamib), a proteasome inhibitor that recently was approved for the
treatment of refractory multiple myeloma, inhibits
the IL-6 signaling cascade in vitro.158 Another compound that reportedly suppresses IL-6 levels is eicosapentaenoic acid, a derivative of fish oil.159
Resveratrol, a component of red grapes, berries, and
peanuts, inhibits the constitutive and the IL-6induced activation of STAT3 expression in multiple
myeloma cells, resulting in the down-regulation of
cell proliferation and the potentiation of apoptosis
induced by bortezamib and thalidomide.160

IL-6 Treatment Strategies in Cancer/Hong et al.

Atiprimod ([2-(3-Diethylaminopropyl)-8,8-dipropyl2-azaspiro4,5 decane dimaleate]) inhibits STAT3 and
protein kinase B (Akt), hence blocking IL-6 signaling.161,162 It induces apoptosis of multiple myeloma
cells in vitro161 and currently is in early clinical testing in multiple myeloma and other tumors. A
response already has been demonstrated in a carcinoid.163 Other small-molecule inhibitors eventually
may prove useful for therapeutically inhibiting IL-6
in various cancers. One example is 20S,21-epoxy-resibufogenin-3-acetate (ERBA),164 which is a nonpeptide antagonist of the IL-6R. ERBA apparently is
specific for IL-6, and does not affect other IL-6 family members. ERBA suppresses IL-6 binding to IL-6R
in a dose-dependent manner, and it is noteworthy
that ERBA markedly inhibited body weight loss in an
experimental model of colon 26-induced cancer
cachexia.
Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin
(DHMEQ),
which is derived from the structure of the antibiotic
epoxyquinomicin C, suppresses the constitutive activation of NF-kB in the estrogen-independent breast
adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231.165 MDAMB-231 cells secreted IL-6 and IL-8 without stimulation, and DHMEQ decreased the secretion levels
of both cytokines. DHMEQ significantly inhibited
the growth of tumors derived from MDA-MB-231
and MCF-7 cells that were grown in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. This molecule may
be another potential treatment for various breast carcinomas.54,165
Other targets or alternative approaches may have
theoretical benefit. One strategy would be to block
the effects of sIL-6R through a gp130-Fc fusion protein, which interferes with trans-signaling through
the IL-6/sIL-6R complex. A dominant negative form
of gp130 also may be useful in inhibiting the growthstimulatory effects of IL-6 on various tumors.166
New molecules that target IL-6 trans-signaling
through gp130 surface receptors include mini-gp130elastin-like peptide (ELP), which is a recombinant
protein that contains the first 3 domains of gp130
fused to 100 repeats of ELP. Mini-gp130-ELP binds
the IL-6/sIL-6R complex and is active biologically. It
inhibits IL-6 trans-signaling, as measured by its ability to inhibit sIL6R-mediated activation of STAT3
phosphorylation and proliferation in human hepatoma cells. ‘‘Molecular farming’’ using transgenic
tobacco plants provides a cost-effective strategy for
manufacturing large amounts of pure biologic proteins.166,167 Targeted biologic therapies include IL-6conjugated toxins (based on fusing the IL-6 gene to
Pseudomonas exotoxin or diphtheria toxin genes) and
new MoAbs directed against IL-6 and IL-6R.154

1923

The truncated form of IL-6 that is identified in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and renal cell
carcinoma potentially may be used to inhibit IL-6
bioactivity and to inhibit IL-6 binding to soluble receptor. Another strategy involves the induction of IL6 autoantibodies through vaccination with an engineered IL-6R antagonist.168

Summary
The 21st century has ushered in an inchoate understanding of targeted therapeutics in cancer. This field
is built on the fundamental knowledge of basic
mechanisms of tumor development gleaned from the
molecular and cellular biology arena.
IL-6 is one of the most ubiquitously deregulated
cytokines in cancer, and increased levels of IL-6 have
been observed in virtually every tumor studied. Perhaps this is not all that surprising considering the
pleiotropic nature of IL-6 and its involvement in the
normal regulation of almost every body part and system. In cancer patients, high levels of IL-6 predict an
adverse outcome and are believed to contribute to
weight loss, fever, and other paraneoplastic symptoms. On the basis of these observations, and given
the role of IL-6 in the immune response and in promoting cancer cell proliferation, strategies that target
IL-6 are emerging in the clinic. Examples of targeted
anti-IL-6 therapies include IL-6 conjugated to a toxin
and MoAbs against IL-6 or IL-6R. Although they still
are in a nascent stage of clinical investigation, some
of these strategies, eg, those that use MoAbs against
IL-6 or its receptor, already have demonstrated significant clinical antitumor activity against a variety
of malignancies, including but not limited to myeloma, lymphoma, and Castleman disease.
