ABSTRACT
Deregulation of the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signalling network is
a hallmark of oncogenesis. Also medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain
tumor in children, is characterized by high levels of AKT phosphorylation and activated
PI3K signalling in medulloblastoma is associated with enhanced cellular motility,
survival and chemoresistency underscoring its role of as a potential therapeutic target.
Here we demonstrate that GDC-0941, a highly specific PI3K inhibitor with good clinical
tolerability and promising anti-neoplastic activity in adult cancer, also displays antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in pediatric human medulloblastoma cell lines.
Loss in cell viability is accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of AKT, a downstream
target of PI3K. Furthermore, we show that GDC-0941 attenuates the migratory
capacity of medulloblastoma cells and targets subpopulations expressing the stem
cell marker CD133. GDC-0941 also synergizes with the standard medulloblastoma
chemotherapeutic etoposide. In an orthotopic xenograft model of the most aggressive
human medulloblastoma variant we document that oral adminstration of GDC-0941
impairs tumor growth and significantly prolongs survival. These findings provide a
rational to further investigate GDC-0941 alone and in combination with standard
chemotherapeutics for medulloblastoma treatment.

course [3, 4]. In cancerogenesis the Phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signalling pathway has been identified
as a key driver of cellular proliferation, migration and
angiogenesis. This also pertains to human medulloblastoma
in which activation of PI3K/AKT signaling has been linked
to enhanced tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistancy
[5–7]. Indeed, we and others have previously shown that
primary medulloblastoma of different genetic variants display
high levels of AKT phosphorylation [5–7]. Also PTEN, a
negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, is frequently
downregulated by promoter hypermethylation and/or allelic
losses of the chromosomal region 10q23 [5]. As a target for
cancer therapy PI3K/AKT is of particular interest as it serves
as an integration node in a network of tumor-promoting
signalling pathways including receptor tyrosine kinases.

INTRODUCTION
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant
brain tumor in children. Current medulloblastoma therapy
comprises surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy in
older children. Despite remarkably advances over the
past decades, long-term survival still range from 40% to
70% [1]. Moreover, survivors often suffer from long-term
treatment related neurological sequelae [2]. Thus novel
more specific therapies are urgently needed.
Medulloblastoma can be divided into 5 histological
and at least four biological subgroups – WNT, SHH, group 3
and group 4 - with distinct cellular origins, genetic changes,
gene-expression -methylation profiles as well as clinical

In medulloblastoma, increased copy number of the plateletderived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) and
overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) are associated with poor outcome [8] [9]. Also,
inhibition of tyrosine receptor-activation suppresses cancerpromoting functions in vitro and in vivo [10] [11].
Inspite of the pivotal role of PI3K/AKT in human
medulloblastoma, a xenograft model delineating in vivo
the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of PI3K
inhibition is currently lacking. This is in part due to the fact
that first generation PI3K inhibitors such as wortmannin,
LY294002 and PIK-75 are encumbered by high in vivo
toxicity, and broad off-target activity. [12–17]. Thus until
recently, efforts to further validate PI3K inhibition for
treatment of medulloblastoma have been thwarted by lack
of pharmaceutical inhibitors suitable for patient use. Taking
advantage of the novel, highly specific, clinical grade PanPI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 [18], we confirm that PI3K/
AKT signalling is indeed a critical target for anti-cancer
therapy in human medulloblastoma. In adult cancer GDC0941 has been well-tolerated and exhibited promising antineoplastic activity in phase I/Ib trials of ovarian breast, non
small cell lung cancer and multiple myeloma [19–22].
Here we present first evidence that in human
medulloblastoma, GDC-0941 inhibits proliferation,
induces apoptosis and acts synergistic with etoposide in
suppressing medulloblastoma cell viability. Moreover,
GDC-0941-mediated PI3K-inhibition reduces the
clonogenicity of medulloblastoma cells and leads to
significant reduction of CD133 expressing stem cell-like

medulloblastoma subpopulations. Most importantly we
demonstrate that in an orthotopic xenograft model of the
most aggressive c-myc-amplified human medulloblastoma
variant GDC-0941 adminstration result in tumor growth
delay and survival benefit underscoring the potential of
PI3K-inhibition for medulloblastoma therapy.

RESULTS
To analyse the potential of GDC-0941 in pediatric
medulloblastoma cell lines we have used a panel of human
medulloblastoma cell lines of which MEB-Med-8A, D283
Med, D341 exhibit distinct characteristics of the clinically
most aggressive genetic group 3 variant. The fourth cell
line Daoy is derived from TP53-mutated desmoplastic
medulloblastoma and displaying markers of SHH-group
tumors [23–30].

GDC-0941 treatment leads to profound
reduction of cell viability
In a dose-response study the cytotoxic capacity
of the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 was evaluated in the
medulloblastoma cell lines by MTS assay at 48 h under
standard growth conditions (Figure 1). The vehicle DMSO
served as control. The dose range chosen for in vitro and in
vivo studies was based on pharmakokinetic data available
form phase I/II studies as detailed in the discussion.
At GDC-concentrations corresponding to patient plasma
levels (1–2 μM) cell viability was substantially reduced in

± 1.9% in Daoy, 55.3 ± 2.3% in MEB-Med-8A and 66.2%
± 10% D283 Med with a negligible accentuation of the
observed inhibitory effect in the presence of a ten fold higher
GDC-0941 dose. In contrast at 1 μM GDC-0941, D341 Med
was largely unaffected with cell viability maintained as high
as 89.9 ± 4.5%. Yet, when escalating the drug dose by a log,
a decrease in cell viability to 71.3 ± 5.0% was achieved.

culture at the clinically relevant concentration of 1 μM
GDC-0941, cellular growth of MEB-Med-8A and D283
Med cells was significantly reduced with 51.1 ± 10.4% and
35.6 ± 5.8% inhibition of proliferation respectively. Daoy
cells proved themselves more GDC-resistant with 13.0 ±
1.47% inhibition of proliferation, while D341 Med cells
were essentially unaffected. Escalating the GDC-dose to
10 μM enhanced the attenuating effect on proliferation
to 34.3 ± 2.9% in Daoy and 15.7 ± 9.4% in D341 Med
cells. GDC-0941 also induced apoptosis in all four
medulloblastoma cell lines at a concentration corresponding
to patient plasma levels (Figure 2B). Thus after 48 h at 1 μM

of D283 Med cells were apoptotic. In Daoy and D341 cells

GDC-0941 displays anti-proliferative and

With the intent to further dissect the observed loss
in cell viability into anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
effects, we performed a flow cytometry-based combined

Figure 2: Determination of anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of GDC-0941 in medulloblastoma cells. In a

combined proliferation-apoptosis assay based on a CFSE-7AAD-Annexin-V staining the capacity of GDC-0941 to inhibit proliferation (A)
and induce apoptosis (B) in the stated medulloblastoma cell lines was determined. The cells were treated with 1 μM and 10 μM of GDC0941 for 24 and 48 h respectively. The vehicle DMSO served as control. In contrast to apoptosis, proliferation inhibition was normalized
to the control DMSO. All stated average values for proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction differed significantly (p < 0.05) from
the DMSO control except the value for induction of apoptosis at 1 μM for the cell line D341 Med. The data represents four independent
experiments. (C) upper panel - GDC-0941 induces a G1-phase cell cycle arrest. Daoy and MEB-Med8A cells were exposed to 1 and 10 μM

control. The lower panel in Figure 2C visualizes the effect of GDC-0941 on the adherent cell lines Daoy and MEB-Med-8A. Statistically

apoptosis rates were below 5%, which could be enhanced to
16.7 ± 9% for Daoy when escalating the drug dose by a log.

Aberrant activation of the transcription factor STAT3
is considered critical for medulloblastoma pathogenesis.
In keeping with these findings the four investigated
medulloblastoma cell lines display phosphorylation of
Tyr705 of STAT3 (Figure 3). A crosstalk between the
PI3K/AKT pathway and STAT3 signaling network has
recently been suggested [33] and indeed MEB-Med-8A
exhibit a reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3
protein levels upon GDC-0941 treatment, while in the other
medulloblastoma cell lines this interaction was not observed.

Treatment of medulloblastoma with GDC-0941
induces G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest
PI3K activity is known to be involved in cell cycle
progression [31, 32]. Because of their differential response
profile to GDC-0941 treatment, MEB-Med-8A and Daoy
were chosen to assess cell cycle distribution after 48 h of drug
treatment (Figure 2C, upper panel). Here we demonstrate that
PI3K inhibition arrests medulloblastoma cells at the G0/G1Phase checkpoint. (MEB-Med-8A G0/G1-Phase: DMSO
65.7% ± 1.9%, GDC-0941 1 μM 86.2% ± 1.1%; Daoy G0/
G1-Phase: DMSO 64.4% ± 0.9%, 1μM 73.8% ± 1.4%).

GDC-0941 treatment inhibits medulloblastoma
cell migration
Next we determined the potential of GDC-0941 to
inhibit tumour cell mobility in a standard scratch wound
assay (Figure 4). We chose the cell lines Daoy and MEBMed-8A because of their known migratory properties. At
1 μM GDC-0941 inhibited cellular migration with 137
± 63 μm in comparison to 456 ± 100 μm in the Daoy
control. MEB-Med-8A although characterized by slower
migratory capacity still exhibits a signficant difference
in migration of 11 ± 4 μm at 24 h of drug exposure in
comparison to 75 ± 1 μm in the respective control.
Escalating the dose 10 times did not lead to a further
reduction of the migratory potential neither in Daoy nor
in MEB-Med-8A cells.

The anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects
of GDC-0941 are associated with inhibition of
the PI3K/AKT pathway
Expression and constitutive activation of AKT,
a downstream target of the PI3K has been delineated
in primary medulloblastoma tumour samples [5–7],
In accordance with these findings, we show that the
four investigated medulloblastoma cell lines were
phosphorylated at the catalytic sites T308 and S473 of
AKT (Figure 3). Of note, treatment with 1 μM GDC-0941
led to marked reduction of AKTT308/S473 phosphorylation in
all four medulloblastoma cell lines as early as 1 hour after
drug exposure. Indeed AKT-phorphorylation was even
completely abrogated in D341 Med cells. Yet, only in the
three medulloblastoma lines MEB-Med-8A and D283 Med
and Daoy most responsive to GDC-mediated cytotoxic
effects, AKT protein synthesis itself was compromised in
addition to impaired phosphorylation.

GDC-0941 reduces the clonogenicity of
medulloblastoma cell lines
We also analyzed the capability of GDC0941 to interfere with clonogenicity of the adherent
medulloblastoma cell lines MEB-Med-8A and Daoy
(Figure 5). Treatment of MEB-Med-8A with 1 μM

Figure 3: The anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of GDC-0941 are associated with a reduction of AKT
phosphorylation. Daoy, MEB-Med-8A, D283 Med and D341 Med cells were treated with 1 μM of GDC-0941 for 1, 12, 24 and 48 h.
Total protein levels and the phosphorylation status of AKTT308/S473 and STAT3Y705 were determined by Western blot. GAPDH served as
loading control.

DISCUSSION

GDC-0941 resulted in a reduction of colony numbers
(NC: 41 ± 10) and colony size (ACS: 61 ± 9p2) in
comparison to control (NC: 60 ± 5; ACS: 104 ±
12p2). Also in Daoy, the colony size (155 ± 27p2) was
significantly smaller than in the control (358 ± 55p2)
whilst colony numbers were maintained (113 ± 6 vs
126 ± 10). Escalating the concentration of GDC-0941
to 10 μM enhanced the described effects on colony
number and size in both cell clines (MEB-Med-8A:
NC: 18 ± 4, ACS: 52 ± 8p2; Daoy: NC: 42 ± 4, ACS:
40 ± 5p2).

Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant
pediatric brain tumor that is often resistant to standard
therapy. Therefore novel treatment approaches intercepting
critical regulatory pathways in cancer development and
progression are warranted. Here we present first in vitro
and in vivo evidence that the clinically available panPI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 displays potent anti-neoplastic
activity in medulloblastoma and commends itself as a
possible adjunct to current medulloblastoma treatment.
Indeed in an orthotopic murine model of preestablished human medulloblastoma, treatment with
GDC-0941 results in significant survival benefit.
Humanized orthotopic models are key to evaluate tumor
growth and drug efficacy in the context of a tumorspecific micro-environment. This is particularly true
in brain tumors in which biodistribution of the drug is
of additional interest. Thus to allow for recovery of the
blood barrier, we delayed GDC-treatment for 1 week after
medulloblastoma-installation. Such “tumor growth delay”
studies also mimic the clinical situation of pre-established
tumors more adequately and are of stronger evidence in
drug testing than less stringent “tumor inhibition” studies
based on concomitant tumor and drug inoculation. [34].
Still we observed significant impairment of tumor-growth
after two weeks of GDC-therapy and provide first proof
that treatment with the pan PI3K-inhibitor GDC-0941
shows anti-neoplastic efficacy in an orthotopic humanized
medulloblastoma model even at a relatively low GDCdose compared to reports in other tumors [35]. For in vivo

GDC-0941 delays medulloblastoma growth
and prolongs survival in an orthotopic
medulloblastoma xenograft model
To assess in vivo efficacy of GDC-0941, an
orthotopic medulloblastoma model was established
(Figure  6). To this end 2 x 104 lentivirally transduced
MEB-Med-8A cells stably expressing luciferase were
injected into the cerebellum of immunocompromised mice
resulting in reliable tumor formation as early as one week
post transplantation. Animals with established tumors
received 100 mg/kg GDC-0941 or the pharmaceutical
vehicle once daily. Tumor growth was monitored by
bioluminescence, and mice were taken from the experiment
when clinical impairment due to tumor progression was
observed. Animals treated with GDC-0941 displayed
delayed tumor growth that resulted in significantly longer
survival (26.5 days; median) compared to control animals
(23.5 days).

assessment of GDC-efficacy we chose MEB-Med-8A, a
patient-derived human medulloblastoma line that based
on its molecular and genetic characteristics corresponds
to the most aggressive medulloblastoma group 3, which is
characterized by c-myc amplification and isochromosome
17. MEB-Med-8a derived tumors also mimic the clinical
presentation of this medulloblastoma variant by rapid
and invasive growth that leads to animal death within
2–3 weeks [23, 30]. Despite aggressive tumor growth
inside the spatially confined fossa cranii posterior housing

functions, oral administration of 100 mg/kg GDC-0941
corresponding to intermediate doses applied to patients
in phase Ib studies [19, 20] resulted in suppressed
medulloblastoma growth and significantly prolonged the
survival of treated animals. Yet, for critical appraisal of
delayed tumor progression after oral application of PI3K
inhibitors, one also needs to consider anti-angiogenic
activity as one of the potential underlying mechanisms.
Further studies are clearly warranted to dissect the in vivo
effects of GDC-0941 treatment on PI3K-activity or its
downstream elements in the tumormass itsself versus the
microtumorenvironment.

in vivo. For this purpose 2 x 104 MEB-Med-8A cells were transplanted into the cerebellum. The mice analyzed for tumor growth by
bioluminescent imagining at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks. One week after transplantation mice were treated with 100mg/kg of GDC-0941 once daily
until symptoms occurred. (A) depicts the normalized tumor growth delay while (B) shows the survival of treated and untreated animals via

shown represent six independent experiments.

Nonetheless, in our extensive in vitro analysis we
authenticate that exposure to 1 μM GDC-0941 corresponding
to patient plasma levels significantly diminishes viable
cell numbers in three of four medulloblastoma lines to
50–65%. Only in D341 previously shown to be resistant
to selected cytotoxic drugs 5 μM GDC-0941 were required
to achieve this level of suppression [36, 37]. We based
our choice of in vitro drug concentrations on the original
publication characterizing GDC-0941 as a potent and
selective inhibitor of class I PI3K kinase. In solid tumor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell lines including glioblastoma, cell proliferation was
inhibited at IC50s of 0.28–0.95 μM [18] which corresponds
to the reported GDC-0941 plasma levels in clinical phase
I studies [19, 20]. In these dose escalation trials in patients
with solid tumors, single doses of 15 to 600 mg GDC-0941
were applied. Plasma levels at doses not associated with
grade 3/4 toxicites ranged from 1–10 μM during the first
12 h. Our in vitro assessment reveals that GDC-0941 exerts
its profound cytotoxic activity against medulloblastoma
at concentrations within the reported patients’ plasma

range with little additional efficacy upon dose increase
even by a log.
Of note, at these dose levels GDC-0941 also
sensitizes medulloblastoma lines to etoposite resulting in
synergistic impairment of cell viability (Supplementary
Figure 1). Moreover, GDC-0941 also compromises the
clonogenicity of medulloblastoma cells and targets CD133positive stem cell-like medulloblastoma subpopulations
(Supplementary Figure 2). Further dissection of the antineoplastic activity revealed that GDC-0941 not only
arrests the proliferation of medulloblastoma cell lines
in G0/G1 phase but also induces marked cell death.
Beyond these anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects
GDC-0941 inhibits medulloblastoma cell migration a
pre-requirement for invasion and metastasis. Our results
corroborate most recent findings indicating that beyond
c-myc-amplified medulloblastoma, PI3K inhibition
also synergizes with hedgehog pathway inhibition and
restrains the growth of SHH-group tumors in a murine
allograft medulloblastoma model [27, 38]. Therefore
we hypothesize that loss of PTEN or activation of AKT
could potentially serve as a future biomarker for the
incorporation of GDC-0941 into the standard treatment
regimes for pediatric medulloblastoma.
For validation of GDC-capacity to inhibit the PI3K/
AKT signaling pathway, the phosphorylation status of the
most prominent PI3K downstream signaling molecule,
AKT, was selected as a valid marker for PI3K activity [14].
In line with previous reports documenting high activity
of the PI3K/AKT pathway in primary medulloblastoma,
our data document AKT expression and phosphorylation
of the sites T308 and S473 respectively in all four
medulloblastoma cell lines analyzed [5–7]. Phosphorylation
of these two sites regulates AKT activity and is critical
for the oncogenic potency of the protein [39, 40]. In our
experiments GDC-mediated anti-neoplastic effects were
associated with a reduction in AKT phosphorylation in
all investigated cell lines. Thus, in medulloblastoma we
delineate the capacity of GDC-0941 to inhibit intracellular
signal transduction cascades and underscore the current
concept that PI3K/AKT signaling plays a key role in
medulloblastoma proliferation, survival and migration
[5–7]. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to the PI3Kinhibitor revealed that apart from posttranslational
modifications such as reduced AKT phosphorylation, AKT
protein levels were suppressed in the highly GDC-0941sensitive cell lines, Daoy, MEB-Med-8A and D283 Med.
This observation is in line with the role of AKT as a main
regulator of protein expression via the mTOR signaling
complex and might explain the higher susceptibility of these
cell lines compared to D341 Med [41, 42].
In various cancer entities including medulloblastoma,
the transcription factor STAT3 as downstream target of
various receptor tyrosine kinases has been implicated in
the regulation of cellular programs including cell-cycle
progression, apoptosis, tumour angiogenesis and tumourwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell evasion of the immune system [43–47]. In accordance
with these findings the four tested medulloblastoma cell
lines are characterized by high STAT3 protein expression
and marked phosphorylation of tyrosine 705. Recent
proteomic data uncovered a crosstalk of the PI3K pathway
and the STAT3 signalling network and ascribed STAT3
a key role in PI3K-driven oncogenic transformation
[33]. Here we show that this interaction might also be of
relevance in some medulloblastoma. Indeed in MEB-Meb8A, the most susceptible cell line to GDC-0941-mediated
cytotoxicity, PI3K-inhibition led to concomitant loss of
STAT3 expression and phosphorylation. In view of future
clinical application however, it is noteworthy that in the
three other cell lines, STAT3 phosphorylation seems to
be independent of PI3K signalling. Thus, targeting PI3K
in combination with pathways signalling via STAT3
might enhance the anti-neoplastic activity and prove
therapeutical interest, Yet, whether PI3K/STAT3 crosstalk
is a common event in medulloblastoma needs to be further
elucidated.
In summary, we showed that inhibition of the PI3K
signaling cascade by GDC-0941 inhibits medulloblastoma
proliferation profoundly, induces significant cell death at
concentrations corresponding to patient plasma levels
and synergizes with a standard chemotherapeutic applied
in pediatric medulloblastoma. Moreover, GDC-0941
reduces CD133-positive stem cell-like subpopulations and
compromises the clonogenicity of medulloblastoma cells.
Beyond the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects,
GDC-0941 displays marked inhibition of medulloblastoma
cell migration, a pre-requisite for tumor invasion. Most
importantly, oral adminstration of GDC-0941 delays tumor
growth and promotes survival in an orthotopic model
of the most aggressive human medulloblastoma variant
characterized by c-myc amplification. Yet, we hypothesize
that benefit of PI3K-inhibitor treatment is not restricted
to c-myc-amplified medulloblatoma. WNT-, SHH- or
group 4 tumors that lack c-myc amplification but display
PI3K/AKT pathway activation might as well benefit from
PI3K inhibition. Thus our data provide a rationale to
further evaluate GDC-0941 in combination with standard
chemotherapy for the treatment of medulloblastoma.

186), D283 Med (HTB185) and D341 Med (HTB-187)
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.
The medulloblastoma cell line MEB-Med-8A was
generated by us from a large cell medulloblastoma (TP).
The medulloblastoma cell lines Daoy, D283 Med and
MEB-Med-8A were maintained in complete medium,
namely Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM,
Invitrogen) with L-glutamine supplemented with 1 mM
sodium pyruvate (PAA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Invitrogen). The medulloblastoma cell line D341 Med was
maintained in DMEM with L-glutamine supplemented
with 1mM sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin
and 10% human serum (PAA).

Cell cycle assay
Daoy (2x105/6 well) and MEB-Med-8A (3x105 /
well) cells respectively were plated in 6-well cell culture
dishes. After 48 h of treatment with GDC-0941 the cells
were exposed to 16 nM Hoechst 33342 and incubated
for 45min at 37°C. Both floating and attached cells were
harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry (Navious,
Beckman Coulter). Dead cells were stained by propidium
iodide. After gating on live cells, single cells were gated
using width and area parameters from Hoechst 33342.
The area parameter histogram was used to determine the
percentage of cells in G1, S and G2M phases.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was assessed with CellTiter 96
Aqueous One Solution Cell proliferation Assay (Promega)
which
contains
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium
(MTS). To ensure a linear growth curve over 48 h for
assessment of GDC-0941 inhibitor mediated effects, each
well of 96-well plates was seeded with 2.5x103 Daoy,
6x103 MEB-Med-8A, 104 D283 Med and 104 D341 Med
cells, respectively. After overnight culture in complete
medium, the cells were treated with increasing GDC-0941
concentrations. The vehicle dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
served as control. After 48 h MTS was added according
to the supplier’s protocol and the absorbance was measured
at 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Victor2 Wallac,
Perkin Elmer). Cell viability was calculated in percent of
control.

Immunoblotting analysis
Medulloblastoma cell lines were lysed in RIPA
buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Roche). Subsequently 25 μg of protein were
separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad). The
membranes were blocked for 1 h at RT in Tris-buffered
saline containing 0.1% tween-20 (TBST) supplemented
with 5% BSA. Thereafter, the membranes were incubated
with the primary antibodies (1/1000) overnight at 4°C
and subsequently with the respective secondary antibody
(1/10000) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity
was detected by chemiluminescence and quantified by
means of a ChemiDoc XRS Imaging System (Bio-Rad).

Combined cell proliferation and apoptosis assay
Medulloblastoma cells were stained with CFSE
according to the supplier’s instructions. Daoy (3x105/6
well), MEB-Med-8A (5x105/well), D283 Med (5x105/well)
and D341 Med (5x105/well) cells were seeded in 6-well
cell culture dishes in complete medium. After overnight
culture, the cells were treated with different concentrations
of GDC-0941 for a 24 and 48 h period. Thereafter floating
and attached cells were collected and stained with 7-AAD
and Annexin V antibodies (Annexin V-PE detection kit I,
BD Bioscience) and analysed by flow cytometry (Navios,
Beckman Coulter). Proliferation was traced by CFSE
staining and apoptosis was detected by combined 7AAD/
Annexin V staining and calculated in percent of control.

Colony formation assay
The cell lines Daoy (200 cells/6 well) and MEBMed-8A (1000 cells/6 well) were plated in six well cell
culture dishes. The cells were allowed to adhere and
were incubated for 12 h at 37°C. Thereafter the cells
were exposed to 1 and 10 μM of GDC-0941 respectively.
After 48 h the cells were washed with standard medium
to remove the inhibitor and cultured for another week.
Colony numbers and colony size were assessed by

In vivo inhibitor treatment

IMAGEJ. Particles smaller than 20 pixel2 were excluded
from the analysis since these represented mainly
staining artefacts, cell detritus or non-proliferating single
cells.

To study effects of the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 on
tumor growth in vivo we transplanted 2 x 104 MEB-Med8A cells into the cerebellum of NSG mice. Seven days
after transplantation the mice were randomly separated
into two groups. Group 1 was given the vehicle ELethanol (60:40; cremophor EL, 95% ethyl alcohol, Sigma)
while group 2 was exposed to 100 mg/kg GDC-0941. The
drug was administered once daily by oral gauge. Eventfree survival was defined as the time from transplantation
until symptom onset.

Lentiviral particles and stable cell lines
Lentivirale particles were generated by co-transfection
of HEK293T Lenti-X cells (Clontech) with packaging
plasmids (pMD2.G, pMDLg/pRRE, pRSV-REV, Addgen)
and the lentiviral transfervector (pLenti-III-UbC-Luc2,
Applied Biological Materials Inc.) expressing Luciferase 2.
After 48 and 72 hours the supernatants were pooled, filtered
through a 45 um filter and ultracentrifuged at 87076 g 4°C
for 2 h. The virus titers were determined by HIV p24 antigen
test (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics). MEB-Med-8A cells
were transduced with virus particles (MOI 5) and thereafter
selected with puromycin and validated for homogenous
luciferase activity (Invitrogen).

Statistical analysis
The two-sided Student’s t test was applied to
determine statistically significant differences between
two groups. For in vivo tumor growth and survival the
log-rank Test (Mantel-Cox) and Wilcoxon signed rank
test respectively were applied to determine statistically
significant differences. p < 0.05 (*) was considered as
statistically significant. The values stated within text and
figures are mean ± standard deviation.

Orthotopic transplantation and tumor
formation
Immunocompromised NSG mice were used for
transplantation. The animals were bred and housed in
a specific pathogen-free animal facility at the house for
experimental therapy of the University of Bonn. All
experiments were conducted according to protocols approved
by the institutional animal use and care committee of
Northrhine Westphalia (Germany). To establish intracranial
tumors, medulloblastoma cells were resuspended in PBS and
injected perpendicular to the cranial surface via 5 μL pst2
Hamilton 7105N syringe into the right cerebellar hemisphere
(1 mm to the right of the midline, 1 mm posterior to the
coronal suture, and 3 mm deep) of 5–9 week old anesthetized
NSG mice. fixed in a stereotaxic frame. After transplantation
the animals were monitored daily and sacrificed when
symptoms of tumor growth occured. All procedures were
in strict accordance with the University of Bonn Medical
Center Policy on the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals
(University of Bonn Medical Center Policy and Welfare
Committee, Document ID: 87-51.04.2011.A033).

In vivo bioluminescent imaging

REFERENCES

For the bioluminescent imaging the mice
were anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine. injected
intraperitoneally with 125 mg/kg D-luciferin. 15 min
after injection the animals were imaged using a IVIS
200 imaging station (Caliper Life Sciences). Regions of
interest were defined using living image software, and the
total photons/s/sr/cm2 (photons per second per steradian
per square cm) were recorded weekly to monitor tumor
growth and therapy response. To determine the growth rate
of the tumor the gain in bioluminescence per week was
calculated.
