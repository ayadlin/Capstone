Abstract
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently activated in human cancers, and several
agents targeting this pathway including PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have recently
entered clinical trials. One question is whether the efficacy of a PI3K pathway inhibitor can be predicted based
on the activation status of pathway members. In this study, we examined the mutation, expression, and phosphorylation status of PI3K and Ras pathway members in a panel of 39 pharmacologically well-characterized
human cancer cell lines (JFCR39). Additionally, we evaluated the in vitro efficacy of 25 PI3K pathway inhibitors
in addition to conventional anticancer drugs, combining these data to construct an integrated database of
pathway activation status and drug efficacies (JFCR39-DB). In silico analysis of JFCR39-DB enabled us to evaluate correlations between the status of pathway members and the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors. For example,
phospho-Akt and KRAS/BRAF mutations prominently correlated with the efficacy and the inefficacy of PI3K
inhibitors, respectively, whereas PIK3CA mutation and PTEN loss did not. These correlations were confirmed
in human tumor xenografts in vivo, consistent with their ability to serve as predictive biomarkers. Our findings
show that JFCR39-DB is a useful tool to identify predictive biomarkers and to study the molecular pharmacology of the PI3K pathway in cancer. Cancer Res; 70(12); 4982–94. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) are lipid kinases that
phosphorylate phosphoinositide at position D3 of the inositol
ring (1, 2). The catalytic subunit of class I PI3K is composed
of four isoforms (p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ, encoded
by PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, and PIK3CG). Among these isoforms, PIK3CA is often activated in cancer by gain-of-function
hotspot mutations (3, 4) and gene amplification (5, 6). On
the other hand, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted
on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates PIP3 at position D3 of the inositol ring to
generate PIP2. PTEN has been shown to be a tumor suppressor gene and is often inactivated by deletion or mutation

in cancer (7–9). Activation of PI3K and PTEN loss trigger
sequential phosphorylation of the PI3K downstream signal
cascade, including Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), and mediates a survival signal, as well as tumor proliferation (9). Therefore, the PI3K pathway is thought to be a
promising therapeutic target.
LY294002 and wortmannin are first-generation PI3K inhibitors, but neither has progressed to clinical trials because of
cytotoxicity to liver and skin (10, 11). We previously reported
a selective PI3K inhibitor, ZSTK474, which has potent antitumor activity and low toxicity in vivo (12). Subsequently,
several PI3K inhibitors have been developed, and some including NVP-BEZ235 and GDC-0941 have already entered
clinical trials (13–15). In addition to PI3K inhibitors, antitumor compounds targeting Akt and mTOR have been developed (15–18).
To develop a molecular-targeted anticancer drug, it is
highly desirable to develop predictive biomarkers for stratifying patients susceptible to the drug. In fact, mutations of
EGFR and KRAS are used to predict the efficacy of gefitinib
in lung cancer and that of cetuximab in colorectal cancer,
respectively (19–22). Moreover, Engelman and colleagues recently showed that tumor growth triggered by KRAS mutant
exhibited resistance to NVP-BEZ235 (23). On the other hand,
dysregulation of PIK3CA and PTEN has been reported to be
involved in resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies (24–26). As
mentioned above, PIK3CA mutation and PTEN loss trigger

Signaling Pathway Status and PI3K Inhibitor Efficacy

activation of the kinase cascade of the PI3K downstream
pathway. However, it is not well understood whether the
efficacy of PI3K pathway inhibitors could be predicted by
these upstream abnormalities and downstream activities of
the PI3K pathway.
We previously established a panel of 39 human cancer
cell lines (JFCR39) derived from various organs (27–29).
JFCR39, as well as NCI60 developed by National Cancer Institute, has been used as an in vitro tool to measure “fingerprints” of cytotoxic compounds. Fingerprints are defined as
the patterns of differential drug efficacy across a panel of
cell lines and have been found to reflect mechanisms of
drug action (27–30). ZSTK474 is a compound that we identified as a new PI3K inhibitor based on the similarity with
the fingerprint of LY294002 (12). In other words, each of the
JFCR39 cell lines showed similar responses to ZSTK474 and
LY294002, and the responses varied from cell line to cell
line. This suggested that the status of biological pathways
determining a cancer cell's response to PI3K inhibitors
(which may include the PI3K pathway) is heterogeneous
across these cell lines.
In the present study, taking advantage of JFCR39, we
examined the mutation and/or expression of upstream
regulators of the PI3K and Ras pathways, including four
PI3K isoforms (PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, and PIK3CG), PTEN,
the ERBB family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), KRAS
and BRAF, and the phosphorylation of downstream pathway
members including Akt, TSC2, GSK-3, mTOR, S6K1, mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellualr signal–
regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-1/2, and ERK1/2. Next,
we examined the fingerprints of 25 compounds targeting the
PI3K pathway as well as other conventional anticancer drugs.
We then combined the PI3K and Ras pathway database and
the drug database to develop an integrated database of pathway status and drug efficacies (JFCR39-DB). Using this database, we first evaluated the functional relationships among
these pathway inhibitors and those among drugs by comparing their fingerprints. Second, we evaluated the correlation
between PI3K pathway members and PI3K pathway inhibitors to identify candidate biomarkers for predicting their
efficacy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture
A panel of 39 human cancer cell lines, termed JFCR39,
were previously described (27, 28, 31). Cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) supplemented with 1 μg/mL kanamycin and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum (Moregate Exports) and incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO2. Authentication
of cell lines was done by short tandem repeat analysis using
PowerPlex16 Systems (Promega; data not shown).
Amplification of genomic DNA fragments
for sequencing
Extraction of genomic DNA was done using DNeasy
blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufac-

turer's instructions. Amplification of genomic DNA fragments was done using Pfu Ultra High-Fidelity DNA
polymerase (Agilent Technologies), FastStart High Fidelity
PCR System (Roche Applied Science), or AccuPrime Taq
DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen). Polymerases
and primer sequences used in each reaction are shown in
Supplementary Table S1.
Nucleotide sequence analysis
Sequencing reactions were done using BigDye Terminator
v3.1 and dGTP BigDye Terminator v3.0 (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were
shown in Supplementary Table S1. Nucleotide sequences
were analyzed using a 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and sequence files were edited using 4 Peaks software (Mekentosj B.V.).
Detection of lipid kinase activities of PI3K
p110α mutants
Determination of lipid kinase activities of PI3K p110α
was described as previously (32). In brief, HEK293T cells
were transfected with pFLAG-PIK3CA (with or without
mutation) and pc-PIK3R1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 hours of incubation, cells were harvested
and the lysates were immunoprecipitated by using FLAGTagged Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Sigma-Aldrich).
To detect kinase activity, we used the PI3K-HTRF assay
kit (Millipore) and EnVision 2103 Mutilabel Reader (PerkinElmer).
Preparation of total cell extract
Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4)], 50 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% w/v NP40, 0.1% w/v SDS,
50 mmol/L sodium fluoride, 30 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mmol/L sodium orthavanadate, 5 mmol/L EDTA,
0.1 trypsin inhibitor unit/mL aprotinin, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] and lysed by sonication in an ice
bath. Concentrations of proteins in the extracts were determined using a protein assay kit (Pierce).
Immunoblot analysis
Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE
and the separated proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon FL polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore).
The membrane was incubated with a primary antibody.
The antibodies for PI3K p110α, Akt, phospho-Akt (T308,
S473), phospho-GSK-3 (S9), phospho-TSC2 (T1462), phosphomTOR (S2448), phospho-S6K1 (T389), phospho-MEK1 (S217/
S221), and phospho-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204) were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technologies. The antibodies for PI3K
p110β, p110γ, and p110δ were purchased from Millipore.
The antibody for PTEN was purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Bound antibody was quantitatively
detected using an appropriate antimouse or rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor
680 (Invitrogen) and the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System
(LI-COR). Data shown are median values of three independent experiments.

sterile food and water ad libitum. Human tumor xenografts
were generated by s.c. inoculating nude mice with 3 mm ×
3 mm × 3 mm tumor fragments of human cancer cells. When
the tumors became 100 to 300 mm3 in size, ZSTK474 was p.o.
administered at 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg of body weight following the indicated schedule. The length (L) and width (W)
of the subcutaneous tumor mass were measured by calipers
in live mice, and the tumor volume (TV) was calculated as
TV = (L × W2)/2. Percent treated/control [T/C (%)] was calculated as (TVwith drug/TVcontrol) × 100. To assess toxicity, we
measured the body weight of the tumor-bearing mice. Mice
were finally sacrificed and tumors were excised and frozen in
liquid N2.

Results
Characterization of the mutation status of PIK3Cs,
PTEN, KRAS, and BRAF in JFCR39 cell lines
We first examined the mutation status of PI3K isoforms in
the JFCR39 cell lines (Table 1; Supplementary Table S2).
Analysis of genomic sequences of PIK3CA on exon 9 and exon
20 revealed the hotspot mutations (E545K in four cell lines
and H1047R in three cell lines). Analysis of the full coding
sequence of cDNA revealed four additional missense mutations: I391M, P449T, D549N, and L719F. Evaluation of relative
kinase activity of these mutants revealed that mutant P449T
exhibited gain of function (>2-fold) compared with wild-type
PI3Kα (Fig. 1A). The E545K mutation found in NCI-H460 genomic DNA was not detected in the cDNA, suggesting that
the allele with the E545K mutation was hardly transcribed
in NCI-H460 cells. Therefore, we concluded that seven cell
lines [HCT-116, SK-OV3, BSY-1 (H1047R), MKN-1, MCF7
(E545K), HCT-15 (E545K/D549N), and HT-29 (P449T)] expressed a gain-of-function mutant of PIK3CA. With regard
to two hotspot mutants (E545K and H1047R), we examined
the effect of three representative PI3K inhibitors on their enzymatic activity and found no striking difference in their efficacies compared with wild-type p110α (Fig. 1B).
In addition to PIK3CA, we examined the genomic sequences of all coding exons of PIK3CB, PIK3CD, and PIK3CG
genes and found five missense mutations in PIK3CB, three
in PIK3CD, and eight in PIK3CG (Table 1; Supplementary
Table S2). Most of these mutations were not registered in
the dbSNP database established by The National Center for
Biotechnology Information. Therefore, this study is the first
report showing that cancer cells harbor missense mutations
in PIK3CB, PIK3CG, and PIK3CD as well as in PIK3CA.
Next, we proceeded to examine the genomic sequences of
the PTEN gene and found that the PTEN gene was deleted in
three cell lines (BSY-1, SF539, and PC-3), and seven had missense or frameshift mutations.
We examined the genomic sequences of exon 1 (including
G12 and G13) and exon 2 (Q61) of KRAS and exon 15 (V600)
and exon 11 (G464, G466, and G468) of BRAF (Table 1). Eight
of 39 cell lines had a hotspot mutation in the G12, G13, or
Q61 residue. On the other hand, the BRAF mutation was observed in three cell lines including LOX-IMV1.

Signaling Pathway Status and PI3K Inhibitor Efficacy

Expression of PI3K isoforms, PTEN, Akt isoforms,
and ERBB-family RTKs
We next examined the protein expression of upstream
members of the PI3K pathway that would affect downstream activity, including PI3K isoforms (p110α/β/γ/δ),
PTEN, Akt isoforms (Akt1/2/3), and ERBB-family RTKs
(EGFR/ERBB2/ERBB3; Fig. 2A; Supplementary Data). As expected, p110α and p110β were widely expressed, whereas
p110γ and p110δ, which were thought to be expressed preferentially in leukocytes, were unexpectedly expressed in
most JFCR39 cell lines derived from solid tumors. PTEN expression was undetectable in all of three cell lines with the
deletion and in five of seven cell lines with a mutation,
whereas all of 29 cell lines lacking a mutation or deletion
expressed a certain amount of PTEN protein (Supplementary Fig. S1). Some of the cell lines exhibited overexpression
of Akt isoforms; SF268 and MCF-7 highly expressed Akt1,
whereas OVCAR3 and HBC5 highly expressed Akt2. EGFR
was expressed in a wide variety of cell lines, but in some
cell lines including NCI-H522 and MCF-7, EGFR expression
was absent or present at an extremely low level. ERBB3 was
highly expressed in a wide variety of cell lines derived from
ovarian, gastric, breast, and colorectal cancer cell lines, but
not in most brain cancer cell lines. On the other hand,
ERBB2 was highly expressed in two cell lines (SK-OV-3
and HBC5).
Activation status of downstream members of
the PI3K pathway
We examined the phosphorylation levels of PI3K downstream effectors including Akt (phosphorylated on T308
and S473), mTOR (S2448), S6K1 (T389), GSK-3β (S9), and
TSC2 (T1462; Fig. 2A). We also examined Ras downstream
effectors, phosphorylated MEK1/2 (S217/S221) and ERK1/2
(T202/Y204). Interestingly, the expression pattern of phosphorylated Akt (T308) was highly correlated with phosphorylated TSC2 (r = 0.70) and GSK-3β (r = 0.60), but not with
phosphorylated mTOR and S6K1 (Fig. 2A; Supplementary
Fig. S2). On the other hand, expression levels of phosphorylated Akt (T308) had a significant negative correlation with
phosphorylated ERK1/2 (r = 0.39).
Correlation between upstream abnormalities and
phosphorylation of downstream effectors
in the PI3K pathway
Correlation analysis between upstream abnormalities and
downstream activities revealed some interesting results
(Fig. 2B and C; Supplementary Table S3). For example,
phosphorylation levels of Akt (T308) (P = 0.0015) and
TSC2 (P = 0.011) were significantly higher and those of
MEK1/2 (P = 3.6 × 10−4) and ERK1/2 (P = 2.7 × 10−5) were
significantly lower in eight PTEN-negative cell lines than
those in 31 PTEN-expressing cell lines. This suggested that
PTEN loss conferred activation of PI3K downstream factors
and inactivation of the MAPK pathway. In contrast, phosphorylation levels of Akt (T308) (P = 4.1 × 10−4) and TSC2
(P = 0.0021) were significantly lower in cell lines having a mutation in either the KRAS or the BRAF gene, suggesting inac-

tivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in these cell lines. However,
mutation of PIK3CA did not have significant associations
with downstream activation, including phosphorylation
levels of Akt and MEK.
Determination of efficacy patterns of 25 PI3K pathway
inhibitors across JFCR39 cell lines, or fingerprints,
and evaluation of their modes of action
from their fingerprints
We next examined the efficacy of 25 PI3K pathway inhibitors (Table 2) in each of the JFCR39 cell lines. Then,
we compared the fingerprints of PI3K inhibitors with those
of other conventional anticancer drugs by cluster analysis
(Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S3A). Interestingly, 10 of 11
PI3K inhibitors were tightly clustered and the cluster also
included Akt inhibitor VIII (AKTi-1/2) and rapamycins,
suggesting similarity in the mechanisms of action across
these compounds. Moreover, their fingerprints were clearly
different from those of the remainder of the 10 Akt inhibitors, all of three MEK inhibitors, and other conventional
anticancer drugs. Furthermore, comparison of the fingerprints of 15 PI3K pathway inhibitors in the cluster revealed
that some pairs, including ZSTK474/GDC-0941 (r = 0.86),
wortmannin/PX-866 (r = 0.81), and PI103/PI3Kα inhibitor
IV (r = 0.80), exhibited extremely high correlations, suggesting a close similarity in the molecular mechanisms of
action between each pair of compounds (Supplementary
Fig. S3B–D).
Construction of an integrated database and
correlations between the status of pathway members
and the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors
We have thus far studied the drug efficacy data and the
signal pathway data with regard to JFCR39 cell lines. We
then combined these data to develop an integrated database (JFCR39-DB). Using JFCR39-DB, we studied the relationship between the activation status of the PI3K
pathway and the efficacy of PI3K pathway inhibitors. First,
we examined the correlation between the mutation status
of upstream members and drug efficacy. The Student t test
revealed no significant differences in the efficacies of all of
25 PI3K pathway inhibitors examined, in seven cell lines
expressing a gain-of-function mutant of PI3Kα, and in
the remainder of the 32 cell lines (Fig. 3B; Supplementary
Table S4). As mentioned before, we examined the effect of
three representative PI3K inhibitors on the enzymatic activity of two hotspot mutants of PI3Kα and found no striking
difference in their efficacies compared with wild-type p110α
(Fig. 1B). These results suggest that cancer cells expressing
mutant PI3Kα are susceptible to PI3K inhibitors to a similar
extent as those expressing wild-type PI3Kα. Moreover,

pathway inhibitors. In addition, the mutation status of other
PI3K isoforms did not exhibit striking correlations either.
On the other hand, cell lines having a mutation in either
KRAS or BRAF exhibited resistance to several PI3K pathway
inhibitors including ZSTK474 (Fig. 3B; Supplementary

mutation would be a biomarker for resistance to these PI3K
pathway inhibitors.
Correlation of the efficacy of PI3K pathway inhibitors
with protein expression levels of PI3K isoforms, Akt
isoforms, and ERBB-family RTKs
We next correlated the expression levels of the above proteins with the efficacy of PI3K pathway inhibitors (Fig. 3A).
As a result, we found that expression of p110α had a slight
positive correlation with four PI3K inhibitors including
IC87114 and LY294002. As for p110β, we found that its high
expression correlated with the efficacy of several Akt inhibitors including perifosine. As for Akt isoforms, we found that
high expression of Akt2 was associated with the efficacy
of five PI3K pathway inhibitors including TGX-221 and
LY294002. Correlation analysis between the expression levels
of ERBB-family RTKs and the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors
revealed no significant correlations with PI3K pathway inhibitors. However, high expression of EGFR correlated with resistance to other classes of anticancer drugs such as navelbine
(r = −0.49) and mitoxantrone (r = −0.43), suggesting that EGFR
would confer resistance to these drugs in cancer cells.
Correlation of the efficacy of PI3K pathway inhibitors
with phosphorylation levels of the PI3K/Akt and Ras/
MAPK pathways
Lastly, we correlated the phosphorylation levels of downstream members of the PI3K pathway with drug efficacy
(Fig. 3A). Of note, expression of Akt phosphorylated at S473
had significant correlations with 11 of 25 inhibitors including
ZSTK474 (r = 0.44; Fig. 3C) and wortmannin (r = 0.52). In
addition, phosphorylated TSC2 correlated with 7 of 25 inhibitors, including Akt inhibitor IX (r = 0.41) and CCI779
(r = 0.40). This result suggests that expression levels of Akt
phosphorylated at S473 and phosphorylated TSC2 would be
predictive markers for these PI3K pathway inhibitors.

Phosphorylated Akt levels and KRAS/BRAF mutation
correlated with the in vivo efficacy of ZSTK474
We have thus far studied correlations between the status
of pathway members and the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors
in vitro. The most prominent associations were that phosphorylated Akt correlated with the efficacy whereas KRAS/
BRAF mutation correlated with the inefficacy of PI3K inhibitors including ZSTK474. To test these correlations in vivo,
we inoculated 24 transplantable cell lines of JFCR39 and examined the antitumor effect of ZSTK474 (Supplementary
Fig. S4). We first confirmed that the in vitro efficacy pattern
across the 24 cell lines significantly correlated with the
in vivo efficacy pattern (200 mg/kg; P = 0.02), suggesting
that the in vivo efficacy of ZSTK474 reflected its in vitro
efficacy (Supplementary Fig. S5). Based on these data, we
examined the involvement of phosphorylated Akt and
KRAS/BRAF mutation in the efficacy of ZSTK474 in vivo
(Fig. 4). The Student t test revealed that cell lines having
a hotspot mutation in either KRAS (G12, G13, and Q61)
or BRAF (V600) exhibited inefficacy of ZSTK474 (P = 0.04;
Fig. 4B). Cell lines with PTEN loss such as PC-3 and
BSY-1 exhibited susceptibility to ZSTK474, but the difference was not statistically significant across the 24 cell
lines. On the other hand, expression levels of phosphorylated Akt in the xenografted tumors significantly correlated with susceptibility to ZSTK474 (Fig. 4C). These
results suggest that phosphorylated Akt and KRAS/BRAF
hotspot mutation could be used as a biomarker for predicting the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in the clinic.

Discussion
In this study, taking advantage of the JFCR39 cell line panel, we examined the drug efficacy of PI3K pathway inhibitors
as well as the status of PI3K and Ras pathway members,
and combined them to develop an integrated database. This

Signaling Pathway Status and PI3K Inhibitor Efficacy

database, designated as JFCR39-DB, enabled us to evaluate
correlations between the status of pathway members and
drug efficacy, as well as correlations among pathway members and among inhibitors in silico. First, comparison of the
status of pathway members revealed that PTEN loss significantly correlated with upregulated phosphorylation levels of
PI3K downstream members and with downregulated phosphorylation levels of Ras downstream members, whereas
KRAS/BRAF mutation exhibited an opposite tendency. Second, comparison of drug efficacies revealed that most PI3K
inhibitors and rapamycins were tightly clustered and were
clearly different from other classes of anticancer compounds,
suggesting a similarity in the mechanisms of action across
these compounds in the cluster. Third, correlation analysis
between the status of pathway members and drug efficacy
revealed that phosphorylated Akt and KRAS/BRAF hotspot
mutation correlated with the efficacy and the inefficacy of
PI3K inhibitors, respectively. These correlations were confirmed in xenografted human tumors in vivo, suggesting that
they could serve as predictive biomarkers for PI3K inhibitors.
Correlation analysis among the pathway members revealed that PTEN loss significantly correlated with the phosphorylation levels of Akt, GSK-3β, and TSC2, but PIK3CA
mutation did not exhibit such correlations, suggesting that
PTEN loss was directly connected with activation of these
downstream pathway members. Similar results were recently
shown by Vasudevan and colleagues using NCI60 cell lines
(34) and by Stemke-Hale and colleagues using clinical specimens and cell lines of human breast cancer (35), indicating
the significance of PTEN loss in the activation of the PI3K
pathway. Furthermore, we showed that PTEN loss was not
accompanied by activation of mTOR and S6K1, suggesting
the existence of upstream molecule(s) other than Akt that
may regulate the activation of mTOR and S6K1. Indeed,
mTOR is regulated by energy stress via AMPK and by hypoxia
via HIF1α, as well as by growth factor stimulation via PI3K/
Akt (13). Interestingly, PTEN loss was strongly associated
with inactivation of MAPK pathway components such as
MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Previously, Zimmermann and Moelling
reported that phosphorylation of Raf by Akt inhibited activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway (36), which supports our
observation. On the other hand, mutation in either KRAS or
BRAF was strongly correlated with inactivation of PI3K/Akt,
rather than activation of the MAPK pathway. This result
strongly suggests that gain-of-function mutations of KRAS
and BRAF confer inactivation on Akt and its downstream
pathway.

In this study, we performed a mutation analysis of all coding exons of PIK3CB, PIK3CD, and PIK3CG isoforms, which are
thought to be rarely mutated in cancer (3). Unexpectedly, we
found missense mutations in each isoform that were not registered in the SNP database. Although we could not determine
whether they were cancer-specific somatic mutations or derived from germline mutations that have not yet been registered in the SNP database, this is the first report showing that
cancer cells harbor missense mutations in these PI3K isoforms. The kinase activities of these mutants compared with
their wild-type analogues are under investigation. Cancer cells
having these mutations did not exhibit hyperphosphorylation
of Akt and its downstream factors, suggesting that they did
not activate the canonical PI3K pathway via Akt.
We previously showed that the fingerprints of antitumor
compounds across the JFCR39 cell panel can allow evaluation of similarities in the cellular mechanism of action by
which drugs exert their antitumor activity (28, 29). Comparison of drug fingerprints revealed that most PI3K inhibitors
and rapamycins were tightly clustered and their fingerprints
were clearly different from those of other classes of anticancer compounds, suggesting that they act by similar mechanisms, probably by blocking the PI3K/mTOR pathway.
Moreover, a fine comparison of the fingerprints of these
PI3K pathway inhibitors revealed that ZSTK474 and GDC0941, both of which are specific class I PI3K inhibitors that
do not inhibit other PI3K-related protein kinases including
mTOR (15, 37–39), show similar fingerprints (r = 0.86). On
the other hand, NVP-BEZ235, which is a more potent inhibitor of mTOR than of PI3K (40), exhibited high correlations
with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (r = 0.78), and the correlation was much higher than those with ZSTK474 (r = 0.67)
and GDC-0941 (r = 0.46). Thus, these results suggest that
comparison of fingerprints may accurately distinguish the
cellular target(s) that determine(s) the susceptibility of cancer cells to these drugs.
Using the integrated PI3K database, we correlated the status of these pathway members with the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors. We first found that either gain-of-function mutation of
PIK3CA or PTEN loss did not exhibit significant correlation
with the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors. Brachmann and colleagues recently reported that NVP-BEZ235 selectively induced
apoptosis in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer cells (41). However, in the present study, PIK3CA-mutant cell lines did not exhibit hypersensitivity but were susceptible to PI3K inhibitors
to a similar extent as those with wild-type PIK3CA. Indeed,
similar results were obtained in in vivo experiments using 24

of gain-of-function mutant of p110α to an extent comparable
to the wild-type (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that such PI3K
inhibitors can be used for these cancers. On the other hand,

and colleagues by using PX-866 and 13 human tumor

mutation in the inefficacy of these PI3K inhibitors.

Signaling Pathway Status and PI3K Inhibitor Efficacy

Of the PI3K pathway downstream members examined in
this study, it should be noted that Akt phosphorylated at
S473 had significant correlations with 6 of 11 PI3K inhibitors
including ZSTK474. Moreover, the correlation between phosphorylated Akt levels and the efficacy of ZSTK474 was confirmed in in vivo experiments using 24 human cancer
xenografts. This result indicated that the expression level of
Akt phosphorylated at S473 could be a candidate biomarker
for predicting the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors. The reason why
Akt phosphorylated at S473, but not T308, exhibited this correlation is unknown. Phosphorylation of the S473 residue of
Akt is known to be catalyzed by the TORC2 complex (whose
components include mTOR and rictor) and is required, in addition to T308, for full activation of Akt (43). It is intriguing
that the fully activated form of Akt correlated with the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors.
In summary, we constructed an integrated database of
PI3K and Ras pathway members and the efficacy of PI3K
pathway inhibitors in JFCR39 (JFCR39-DB). In silico correlation analysis using JFCR39-DB enabled us to extract two
candidates, phospho-Akt and KRAS/BRAF mutation, as predictive biomarkers for efficacy of PI3K inhibitors from various pathway members examined. Moreover, we confirmed
these correlations by in vivo studies using 24 xenografted
tumors. The utility of these candidate biomarkers should
be validated through clinical studies in future. In addition,
JFCR39-DB enabled us to study functional relationships

among pathway members and those among drugs. Therefore,
JFCR39-DB described here is a useful tool to identify predictive biomarkers, as well as to study the molecular pharmacology of the PI3K pathway in cancer.

Correction

Correction: Correlating Phosphatidylinositol
3-Kinase Inhibitor Efficacy with Signaling
Pathway Status: In silico and Biological
Evaluations
In this article (Cancer Res 2010;70:4982–94), which was published in the June 15, 2010
issue of Cancer Research (1), there are errors in Table 1, Figure 4, and Supplementary
Figure 1. In Table 1, the mutation "G13D" of the HCT-116 cell line located in the
column "PTEN" is incorrect; it should be located in the column "KRAS". In Figure 4C,
the Pearson correlation coefficient "r ¼ 0.51" should be "r ¼ 0.51". In Supplementary
Figure 1, the description "PTEN status" in the last line of the figure should be "PTEN
protein".
