ABSTRACT
Although radiation therapy is the most effective postoperative adjuvant treatment,
it does not substantially improve the long-term outcomes of glioma patients because
of the characteristic radioresistance of glioma. We found that R-Spondin1 (Rspo1)
expression was elevated in high-grade gliomas and was associated with worse overall
survival and disease-free survival. Rspo1 expression was also associated with reduced
survival rates in glioma patients after treatment with radiotherapy and temozolomide
(RT-TMZ). Importantly, Rspo1 was dramatically upregulated after radiation treatment
in patients with glioma. Rspo1 silencing by shRNA potentiated glioma cell death upon
radiation treatment. In a xenograft nude mouse model, combining radiation and
silencing of Rspo1 potentiated tumor growth inhibition. Thus, combining radiotherapy
with silencing of Rspo1 is a potential therapeutic approach.

findings that Rspo1 is protective against radiation-induced
gastrointestinal syndrome, we hypothesize that Rspo1
may be involved in the radioresistance of tumor cells to
radiation therapy.
Gliomas are the most common primary tumors
arising in the brain. Glioblastomas are high-grade gliomas
that are among the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat
human cancers [8]. Despite the use of conventional
therapeutic modalities, such as surgery, chemotherapy,
and radiotherapy, the prognosis of patients remains poor.
Radiation therapy is a core therapy for malignant glioma,
which consists of concomitant chemoradiotherapy with
temozolomide after debulking surgery [9]. However,
resistance to radiation occurs in most patients, and the
underlying molecular mechanisms of radioresistance are
not fully understood. New therapeutic strategies must be
developed for improved long-term management of these
tumors. Enhancing the effects of radiation, the primary
adjuvant treatment for glioma, may increase the survival
and quality of life of patients.

INTRODUCTION
The R-Spondin (roof plate-specific spondin)
family is a group of four secreted proteins (Rspo1–4)
known to be potent agonists of Wnt signaling with
important functions in development, stem cell survival
and differentiation, and oncogenesis [1]. All four Rspo
family members contain an N-terminal signal peptide
and a C-terminal region rich with positively charged
amino acids [2]. Rspo1, a secreted ~35 kDa molecule,
binds to leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled
receptor (LGR) 4–6 and synergizes with soluble Wnt3a to
induce LRP6 phosphorylation and promote cytoplasmic
stabilization as well as nuclear accumulation of β-catenin
for cellular proliferation, differentiation and stem cell
maintenance [3]. Transgenic expression of Rspo1 induces
significant enlargement of the small and large intestines
[4], whereas administration of recombinant or adenoviral
Rspo1 alleviates intestinal injury and oral mucositis
induced by chemoradiotherapy [5–7]. Based upon the

In this study, we observed that the expression
of Rspo1 was significantly associated with poor
overall survival and reduced survival of patients
with gliomas after treatment with radiotherapy and
temozolomide (RT-TMZ). In particular, we showed that
radiation treatment triggered significant upregulation of
Rspo1 in patients with gliomas, and increased cell death
was observed upon silencing of Rspo1 via shRNA. As a
result, we showed that the combination of radiotherapy
with Rspo1 silencing potentiated tumor growth inhibition
in a xenograft nude mouse model.

Immunoreactivity for the Rspo1 antigens was observed
in 28% (14/50) of the patients with WHO Grade
I  glioma,  36.36% (20/55) of the patients with WHO
Grade II glioma, 48.38% (30/62) of the patients with
WHO Grade III glioma, 55.88% (38/68) of the patients
with WHO Grade IV glioma and 7.5% (3/40) of normal
brain tissues from automobile accident victims without
glioma (Fig. 1A). Notably, the Rspo1 immunostaining
was much stronger in high-grade gliomas than in lowgrade gliomas (Fig. 1B). To confirm the upregulation of
Rspo1, real-time qRT-PCR analysis was performed using
normal brain tissue samples and glioma tissue samples.
Consistent with the results of the immunohistochemical
analysis, elevated levels of Rspo1 mRNA were detected
in high-grade glioma tissues compared with low-grade
gliomas and normal brain tissue samples (Fig. 1C). We
next examined the expression of Rspo1 in glioma cell
lines using Western blotting assays with anti-Rspo1
antibodies. Compared with normal brain tissue lysate,
elevated Rspo1 expression was observed in all six glioma
cell lines (Fig. 1D). These results were also confirmed by
real-time qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1E).

RESULTS
Overexpression of Rspo1 in human glioma
tissues and glioma cell lines
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to
determine the specific expression of Rspo1 protein in
human gliomas. Using an antibody against Rspo1 for
immunostaining, we examined tissue samples from 235
patients with a pathological diagnosis of astrocytic glioma.

Expression of Rspo1 correlates with
shortened survival and decreased survival
rates after RT-TMZ therapies

Rspo1 is upregulated in glioma tumor cells upon
treatment with radiation
To investigate whether radiation treatment can trigger
tumor-specific increases in Rspo1 levels in patients with
gliomas, we identified patients for whom tumor samples were
available both before and after radiation treatment. As shown
in Fig. 3A, Rspo1 protein was significantly upregulated after
radiation therapy as determined by immunohistochemical
analysis. Rspo1 upregulation was also confirmed at the
mRNA level by real-time qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3B). To
further investigate the role of Rspo1 in radiation-treated
glioma cells, we selected the glioma cell line U87 as our
study model. Both Rspo1 protein and mRNA levels were
increased upon exposure to radiation in U87 cells, and this
upregulation was concentration-dependent (Fig. 3C, 3D).
The upregulation of Rspo1 protein was also confirmed using
immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3E).

We also evaluated whether immunoreactivity
against Rspo1 was correlated with overall survival in
235 patients with glioma. We observed that upregulation
of Rspo1 predicted shorter overall survival and diseasefree survival in patients with gliomas (Fig. 2A and 2B).
Multivariate survival analysis using the Cox proportional
hazards model further indicated that upregulation of
Rspo1 was correlated with a higher hazard ratio (HR)
and poor clinical outcomes (overall survival, p = 0.008,
HR 7.778; for disease-free survival, p = 0.012,
HR 6.357) (Table 1). We therefore investigated the role
of Rspo1 in therapies using radiation concomitantly
with adjuvant temozolomide (RT-TMZ). We observed
that the one-year survival rates were 66.3% (61/92) for
patients  with negative Rspo1 expression and 23.86%
(21/88) for patients with positive Rspo1 expression
(p < 0.0001, Fig. 2C). These results highlight the clinical
importance of Rspo1 in determining the prognosis of
patients with gliomas and reveal a new target for glioma
therapy.

Silencing of Rspo1 potentiates radiation-induced
cell death and tumor growth inhibition

treatment suggests that the dependence on Rspo1 for

cells. Thus, we analyzed the effect of silencing Rspo1
by shRNA on radiation-induced cell death. U87 cells
were transfected with plasmids expressing Rspo1
shRNAs and treated with increasing doses of radiation.
Both Rspo1 shRNA1 and Rspo1 shRNA2 silenced
Rspo1 protein expression by over 80% compared
with nonsense control shRNA (Fig.  4A). Silencing of
Rspo1 was associated with a marked potentiation of

radiation-induced cell death, as shown by the loss of
cell permeability (Fig. 4B) and decrease in cell survival
(Fig. 4C). Furthermore, a clonogenic survival assay was
performed to measure radiation sensitivity. We found
that the survival fraction was significantly decreased
when Rspo1 was knocked down by Rspo1 shRNA in
U87 cells (Fig.  4D). Activation of the cell apoptosis
marker caspase 3 (Fig.  4E) and DNA fragmentation
(Fig. 4F) were increased accordingly.

section, and survival (C) were evaluated 48 h after treatment. The results were normalized against those obtained with control (untreated)
cells. Whereas control shRNA-transfected cells showed a general resistance to radiation treatment, Silencing of Rspo1 strongly induced
cell death and decreased cell survival in the presence of radiation. (D) Survival fraction curves of U87/control shRNA cells and U87/Rspo1

U87 cells were transfected as in B and C and treated with the indicated dose of radiation for 24 h. Active caspase 3 levels (E), normalized to
those in untreated cells, and DNA fragmentation (F) were evaluated as described in the Materials and Methods section. Whereas radiation
failed to induce apoptosis in control shRNA-transfected cells, Rspo1-silenced cells showed a strong increase in the apoptotic rate. The
results represent at least three separate experiments. Error bars: ± S.D. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01.

To test whether Rspo1 shRNA is toxic to normal
brain cells, we transfected Rspo1 shRNA into normal rat
astrocyte D1 TNC1 cells, which express very low levels
of Rspo1 (data not shown). We found that Rspo1 shRNA
had no effect on D1 TNC1 cell proliferation, as measured
by MTT assay (Supplemental Fig. S1A), and had no effect
on the radiation sensitivity of D1 TNC1 cells, as measured
by a clonogenic survival assay (Supplemental Fig. S1B).
We then assessed whether the in vitro effects
described above could be reproduced in vivo in a
therapeutic setting. Adenovirus particles encoding Rspo1
shRNA1 (Ad-Rspo1 shRNA1) and nonsense control
shRNA (Ad-Ctrl shRNA) were produced. U87 cells were
engrafted into nude mice, and animals with established
palpable tumors were treated once a week by i.p. injection
of Ad-Ctrl shRNA1 or Ad-Rspo1 shRNA1 at 1 × 108
pfu/mouse. These injections were administered alone
or in combination with 40 Gy of radiation. Single-agent
treatment (Ad-Rspo1 shRNA1 or radiation) according to
this administration protocol was associated with detectable
but weak tumor growth inhibition, which was resolved
during the treatment (Fig. 5A). However,  co-treatment
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of radiation and Ad-Rspo1 shRNA1 was associated with
stronger and prolonged tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 5A).
The stronger and prolonged effect was associated with
increased tumor apoptosis. We assessed the apoptosis
level in xenografted tumors after 48 h of treatment with
radiation alone, Ad-Rspo1 shRNA1 alone or a combination
of both agents. Similar results were observed when using
U343 cells (Supplemental Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 5B,
radiation alone or Ad-Rspo1 shRNA1 alone failed to
significantly induce caspase 3 activity in the tumors;
however, the combined treatment triggered significant
caspase 3 activation. The adenovirus infection rate after
48 h in tumor tissue was determined (Fig. 5C), and the
level of Rspo1 mRNA in the tumor was determined 48 h
after adenovirus infection (Fig. 5D).
We next tested whether overexpression of Rspo1
further increased radioresistance. We transfected the
Rspo1 plasmid into U87 cells and established stable
cell lines. Using a clonogenic survival assay, we found
that overexpression of Rspo1 further increased
the radioresistance of these cells (Supplemental
Fig. S3A and S3B).

DISCUSSION

induction of cell death upon silencing of Rspo1 by
shRNA. As a result, we showed that the combination of
radiation with silencing of Rspo1 potentiated the inhibition
of tumor growth in a xenograft nude mouse model. Our
results thus underscore an important role for Rspo1 in the
radioresistance of malignant gliomas and provide novel
evidence of the potential therapeutic utility of Rspo1 for
the treatment of malignant gliomas. Specifically, there is
no or very low Rspo1 expression in normal brain cells,
which indicates that inhibition may have no effect on
normal brain cells. When we inhibited Rspo1 using Rspo1
shRNA in normal rat astrocyte D1 TNC1 cells, we found
that Rspo1 inhibition did not have any effect on normal
rat astrocyte D1 TNC1 cells. These results indicated that
Rspo1 inhibition does not have toxic effects on normal
brain cells. However, whether neural stem cells express
Rspo1 and the role of Rspo1 in neural stem cells need
further study.
Rspo1 was originally identified as a growth factor
for intestinal crypt cells in a transgenic mouse model [4].

Although radiation therapy is the primary adjuvant
treatment modality known to increase the survival of
patients with malignant gliomas, it is not a cure, and
90% of tumors recur inside the irradiated tumor volume
[10, 11]. In this study, we showed that Rspo1 is frequently
upregulated in gliomas (43.4%, 102/235), particularly
in high-grade glioma (stages III and IV, 52.3%, 68/130),
and that a positive association exists between Rspo1
expression and advanced clinicopathological features. In
addition, Rspo1 immunoreactivity was inversely correlated
with overall survival and disease-free survival in patients
diagnosed with glioma, and it was associated with reduced
survival after RT-TMZ therapy, further underscoring
the clinical significance of Rspo1 in the pathogenesis,
prognosis and treatment of glioma. In particular, we
showed that radiation treatment triggered a significant
increase in the Rspo1 level in patients with gliomas. We
showed that this upregulation is associated with increased

Systemic administration of Rspo1 decreased the
histological and clinical manifestations of dextran sulfate
sodium-induced colitis [12] as well as chemotherapy- and
radiation-induced oral mucositis in mice [5]. Furthermore,
the blood level of Rspo1 was increased after exposure of
the mice to whole-body irradiation, and treatment with
adenovirally expressed Rspo1 or pure recombinant Rspo1
protein increased the survival rate of lethally irradiated
mice [6, 7]. All of these previous studies suggest that
Rspo1 plays an important role in radioresistance, allowing
tissue repair or regeneration. However, the role of Rspo1
in tumors is still unclear. For the first time, our studies
have shown that Rspo1 expression is correlated with the
radioresistance of advanced gliomas, which suggests that
Rspo1 protects not only normal tissue but also tumor
cells from radiation injury. Zhou et al. suggested using a
higher dose of chemoradiotherapy to destroy colon tumor
cells more effectively based on the chemoradioprotective
effects of Rspo1/Slit2 protein in normal tissue [7] Our
results thus indicate that treatment with Rspo1 may also
enhance tumor cell radioresistance, thereby interfering
with the therapeutic effect. It would be interesting to
determine whether a tumor therapy dosage window exists
between normal tissue radioprotection and tumor cell
radioresistance induced by Rspo1. Additionally, it would
be very interesting to test the radiation dose for tumor
therapy. Combined treatments involving tumor-specific
silencing of Rspo1 combined with non-tumor-specific
Rspo1 treatment would be useful, as such treatments could
both decrease tumor cell radioresistance and increase
normal cell radioprotection.
R-Spondins are a family of secreted proteins that
are potent activators of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway.
Rspo1 has been demonstrated to bind with high affinity
to the Wnt co-receptor, LRP6, to induce phosphorylation,
stabilization and nuclear translocation of cytosolic
β-catenin, thereby activating TCF/β-catenin-dependent
transcriptional responses in intestinal crypt cells [13, 14].
The mechanism by which Rspo1 regulates glioma cell
radioresistance requires further investigation. Recently,
Li et al. reported that Rspo1 is expressed by neurons in
the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH),
and injection of Rspo1 into the third cerebral ventricle
inhibited food intake [15]. The question of whether Rspo1
can protect normal brain tissue from radiation injury
requires further investigation.
In general, glioblastomas are considered
radioresistant tumors, as different radiation modalities
have failed to control them in the clinic. Multiple
mechanisms have been proposed to be associated with
radioresistance in human glioblastoma cells. Recently,
cancer cells with stem cell-like properties have been
described in a wide range of human tumors. The cancer
stem cell model suggests a hierarchical organization
of tumors in which a subpopulation of tumor cells at
the apex drives and maintains human tumors [16].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Glioma stem cells were also identified and were reported
to be more resistant to radiation compared with matched
non-stem glioma cells [17–19]. It would be very
interesting to test whether glioma stem cells express Rspo1
and whether Rspo1 inhibition increases the radiation
sensitivity of glioma stem cells.
Tumors are complex and diverse, and almost every
tumor is unique, which is why finding an effective cure for
all tumors is challenging. To increase our understanding of
tumors, similar tumors can be analyzed to determine their
common features. In the present study, we demonstrated
that a subpopulation of glioma cells express Rspo1, and
this subpopulation of gliomas is radioresistant. Silencing
of Rspo1 in this subpopulation of gliomas could produce
good therapeutic effects when combined with radiation
therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Informed consent was obtained from all patients
enrolled in this study, and the study protocol was approved
by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Guangdong
Medical College. The protocols for all animal studies were
also approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee
of Guangdong Medical College.

Immunohistochemical staining
Human glioma samples were obtained from the
Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College. The
pathological grade of these tumors was defined according
to the 2007 WHO criteria. Normal brain samples were
obtained from automobile accident victims without
glioma. Immunohistochemical staining was performed as
previously described.17 Tissue sections (5 μm thickness)
were deparaffinized, and endogenous peroxidase was
quenched using 3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min. The
sections were incubated in a solution of 10% BSA in PBS
at 37°C for 1 h to block non-specific binding; then, they
were incubated with IgG (control) or specific antibodies in
PBS containing 10% BSA at 4°C overnight. Subsequently,
the sections were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase
anti-rabbit antibody. Immunoreactivity was detected using
the ImmunoPure Metal-Enhanced Diaminobenzidine
(DAB) Substrate Kit (Pierce), and the tissue sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin. For determination of
Rspo1 immunoreactivity, cytosolic or nuclear staining
of yellowish or brownish granules was graded using
the following scale: 0 for background staining, 1 for
faint staining, 2 for moderate staining and 3 for strong
staining. The intensity of the immunoreactivity signal
was determined relative to that of U87 cells transfected
with the Rspo1 plasmid, which also served as a positive
staining control. The staining intensity of the control

was arbitrarily designated as 3. In addition, the number
of immunopositive cells expressed as a percentage
of the total cell number throughout the entire tissue
section was graded according to the following scale:
0 for < 5%, 1 for 5–25%, 2 for 26–50%, 3 for 50–75%
and 4 for 75%–100%. The immunostaining intensity and
the percentage of positive tumor cells were multiplied
to produce a weighted score for each tumor specimen.
Weighted scores of 0–2 and ≥ 3 were defined as negative
and positive staining, respectively. [20]

The relative expression levels of the samples are presented
using a semi-log plot.

Immunoblotting
For immunoblotting, the samples were subjected to
SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore)
and detected using the appropriate primary antibodies
followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG. The blotting signals
were detected using SuperSignal West Dura Extended
Duration Substrate (Pierce). Quantitative analysis of the
immunoblotting signals was performed by densitometry
using LAS4000 Image Software (Fuji Film).

Plasmids, antibodies and chemicals
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against Rspo1
was purchased from Thermo (U.S.). The Rspo1 shRNA1
target sequence was 5′- TACACTTGGTGCAGAAGTT -3′,
the
Rspo1
shRNA2
target
sequence
was
5′- TGCACTTGTTCATGTCGGG -3′, and the nonsense
shRNA sequence was 5′-TACGCATCCGCAACTGCAG-3′.
The rabbit anti-Rspo1 antibodies used for Western blotting,
immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical assays were
purchased from Abcam. The mouse anti-β-actin antibodies
used for the immunoblotting assay were purchased from
Sigma. The secondary antibodies anti-mouse IgG-HRP and
anti-rabbit IgG-HRP were purchased from Sigma.

Immunofluorescence staining
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS at room
temperature for 20 min. The samples were blocked with
1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) and incubated
with the appropriate primary antibody at 37°C for 1 h.
After extensive washing, the samples were incubated
with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG at 37°C
for 1 h. The cells were then washed and mounted for
observation under a scanning confocal microscope (TCS
SP2 Leica).

Cell culture

Cell death assay and conventional radiation
treatment

The human glioma cell lines U138, H-4, ­HS683, U-87, U-251, and U-343 were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The
cells were cultured according to the recommendations
from the ATCC. U87 cells were transfected with
plasmids containing Rspo1 shRNA or Ctrl shRNA using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Positive transfectants
were selected by incubating cells with 0.8 mg/ml G418
(GIBCO BRL) for two weeks to obtain a stable cell line
for Rspo1 silencing in subsequent assays.

Exponentially growing U87/v cells, U87/Rspo1
shRNA cells and U87/Rspo1 shRNA2 cells were
trypsinized and irradiated at 10, 20, 40, and 60 Gy. The
radiation was derived from a 4 MV Linear Accelerator
(Varian, USA), and the dose rate was 320 mu/min. After
irradiation, the cells were counted. For total cell death
assays, 5 × 103 cells per well were grown in 96-well plates
in serum-poor medium and treated with radiation. After
48 h, cell death was evaluated using the bioluminescence
cytotoxicity assay ToxiLight (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell survival was measured using the MTS assay
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (CellTiter
96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay,
Promega). Cells (3 × 103) were grown in a 96-well
plate in serum-poor medium for 16 h, treated with the
indicated radiation dose in serum-free medium, and
cultured for 48 h.
Caspase 3 activity was assayed using the caspase3/
CPP32 Fluorimetric Assay Kit (Gentaur Biovision,
Brussels, Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Caspase 3 activity (activity/min/μg of
protein) was calculated from a 1 h kinetic cycle reading
on a spectrophotometer (405 nm/510 nm, Infinite F500,
Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). DNA fragmentation

qRT-PCR
qRT-PCR was performed as described.17 Total
RNA was extracted using the Absolutely RNA Miniprep
Kit (Stratagene) and reverse transcribed using the
ThermoScript RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). The cDNA
was used in real-time PCR with SYBR-Green Master
PCR Mix (Applied Biosystems), and triplicate reactions
were performed. All RT2 and qPCR primer pairs were
purchased from SABiosciences. PCR and data collection
were performed using the Step-one qPCR System
(Stratagene). All expression levels were normalized to the
expression levels of endogenous β-actin, which served as a
control. The relative expression level for each target gene
was compared with that of the calibrator gene (β-actin)
and expressed as 2-(Ct-Cc) (Ct and Cc are the mean
threshold cycle differences after normalization to β-actin).

and W  =  width). Ten animals from each group were
sacrificed 48 h after the initial treatment to evaluate
caspase 3 activation in tumor tissue and to quantify
Rspo1 expression in engrafted tumor cells. The data
were analyzed using Student’s t-test, and p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

was measured by immunofluorescence staining with an
antibody against rH2X, and the staining sensitivity was
determined.

Clonogenic assay
Exponentially growing U87/v cells, U87/Rspo1
shRNA cells and U87/Rspo1 shRNA2 cells were
trypsinized and irradiated at 10, 20, 40, and 60 Gy. The
radiation was derived from a 4 MV Linear Accelerator
(Varian, USA), and the dose rate was 320 mu/min. After
irradiation, the cells were counted to determine the final
cell number required for each colony-forming experiment
in 6-well plates. For example, to obtain 150–250 colonies
per well in control wells after the incubation period,
1000 cells were plated. Each radiation dose and untreated
control was set up in triplicate wells. All plates were
incubated at 37°C for 8–14 days depending on the cell
growth rate. The plates were then fixed with 70% ethanol,
and the colonies were stained with 1% Giemsa solution.
Colonies that consisted of more than 50 cells were scored.
At least three independent experiments were performed
for each cell line. The cell survival curves were drawn by
plotting the means of three experiments.

Statistical analysis
Overall survival is represented in months and
defined as the interval between the date of the surgery
and the date of death or the last follow-up. Overall
survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier
method, and the difference in survival was evaluated
using the log-rank test. p < 0.05 and 0.01 were defined as
statistically significant and very significant, respectively.
All computations were performed using R 2.9.0 software
(http://www.r-project.org).

nonsense control shRNA and Rspo1 shRNA1 (sequence:
5′- TACACTTGGTGCAGAAGTT -3′) were purchased
from Vector Biolabs (U. S., PA), and 1 × 108 pfu adenoviral
particles containing the above-mentioned constructs were
injected into the tail vein of nude mice bearing tumors.
After 48 h, the tumors were collected for determination
of Rspo1 expression by immunofluorescence staining or
by qRT-PCR.

Six-week-old (18–20 g body weight) male athymic
nu/nu mice were obtained from SLAC Laboratory
Animals (China, Shanghai). The mice were housed
in sterilized filter-topped cages and maintained in a
pathogen-free animal facility. U87 cells were implanted
by s.c. injection of 107 cells in 100 μl of PBS into the
right flank of the mice. Once the tumors were established
(V≈100 mm3), the mice were treated with adenovirus
expressing Rspo1 shRNA and/or radiation for 2 weeks.
For the radiation treatment, the mice were anesthetized
using ketamine (100  mg/kg, i.p.), and the tumor area
was irradiated at 40 Gy. The radiation was derived from
a 4 MV Linear Accelerator (Varian, USA), and the dose
rate was 320 mu/min. Tumor sizes were measured with
a caliper. The tumor volume was calculated with the
formula V = [L × W2] × 0.52 (V = volume, L = length,
