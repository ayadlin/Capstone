since a significant number of novel kinases (71) remain
unconfirmed at the protein level [2], it is important to
gain a more complete functional understanding of the
human kinome. Furthermore, many of these are likely
to contribute to cancer and provide novel therapeutic
targets to circumvent the side effects of current
chemical and radiation therapies or the acquired
resistance to more specific therapies.
Over the past decade, our lab has developed a
number of new approaches for studying the role of the
cellular cytoskeleton and the subcellular domains that it
regulates during cell migration, neurogenesis and
cancer progression [14-22]. More specifically, we have
developed a unique method to purify and characterize
cell pseudopodia using a 3.0 Î¼m porous membrane
system. When attached to the top of these membranes
and subjected to a chemoattractant, cells begin to
protrude their pseudopodia through these pores - they
can then be mechanically isolated from the remainder
of the cell body [19-21]. We used these unique
approaches
to
probe
the
proteome
and
phosphoproteome of these subcellular structures. Our
ability to affinity purify pY proteins from isolated
pseudopodia proved to be a robust system to identify
proteins involved in cell migration. Also, the complete
solublization of pseudopodial proteins in SDS buffer

INTRODUCTION
The completion of the human genome has enabled
the identification of almost all protein kinase genes
(approximately 518 total). While this number is less
than originally predicted [1], it constitutes almost 2%
of the entire human genome [2]. Because kinases are
integral to almost all signaling processes in eukaryotic
cells via their role as posttranslational modifiers, it is
crucial to identify and characterize their molecular and
functional properties in order to more fully understand
human physiology and disease. For example, kinases
play central roles in cellular processes ranging from
cell-cycle progression to cell motility to cell
differentiation, and their proper function controls
development and homeostasis in the adult [3-8].
Additionally, dysregulation of kinase genes accounts
for the origin of many human diseases, making them an
important family of genes to comprehensively
understand - possibly leading to novel therapeutic
approaches for fighting multiple pathologies [9-13].
Well known kinases, such as Src, MAPK and, ErbB2
have well established roles during development and
cancer progression. Critical insights into their functions
and mechanisms of action have led to important
therapeutic strategies for fighting cancer [5]. Therefore,

that PEAK1 contains all three motifs YAVK, HCD,
and NFS. While the YAVK and HCD motifs are highly
conserved on the critical K and D residues, the D
residue in the NFS motif is replaced by N, which
classifies it as an atypical kinase [2]. However, little is
known about whether this amino acid substitution can
affect kinase catalytic activity or whether this PEAK1
residue (and/or others) may be mutated in human
cancers to confer full catalytic activity [2]. While we
were initially able to demonstrate tyrosine kinase
activity in the full-length protein that had been
immunoaffinity purified from mammalian cells, this
did not remove the possibility that other tyrosine
kinases bind and co-precipitate with PEAK1,
accounting for the detected activity. To address this
possibility, we generated a C-terminal construct that
included the kinase domain (a.a. 1289-1746) that was
expressed in and purified from E. coli. Notably, this
allowed us to generate large amounts of the purified
PEAK1 truncation mutant, and it also displayed
intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity in vitro [24].
In agreement with PEAK1 containing an actintargeting region, modulation of PEAK1 protein levels
affected the phosphorylation level of several known
cytoskeletal regulatory proteins including paxillin,
p130Cas and Erk, and it was found to associate with
the Crk adaptor protein. Crk regulates cell spreading

significantly improved our yield of pY proteins, which
can be tightly associated with the insoluble
cytoskeleton [23]. This approach allowed us to identify
many low abundance pY proteins involved in cell
migration and led to the discovery of the
phosphotyrosine protein and kinase, PEAK1
(pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1, KIAA2002,
sgk269). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that
PEAK1 is a new non-receptor tyrosine kinase that
operates within Src-p130Cas-Crk-Paxillin and RasRaf-Erk signaling pathways to regulate cell
proliferation, migration and cancer progression [24]
(Table 1).
PEAK1 is a member of the new kinase family three
(NKF3) and its domain structure is complex, with
predicted consensus binding and/or substrate sites for
Src, Erk, Shc
and Crk. Notably, PEAK1 is
ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting
that it has a major role in normal physiology [24]. In
addition, we determined that PEAK1 contains an Nterminal actin-targeting region and a functional Cterminal atypical kinase domain (Figure 1). All active
kinases are predicted to contain three motifs VAIK,
HRD, and DFG within the kinase domain [2]. Each
motif contains one highly conserved residue (VAIK:
K, HRD: D, DFG: D) that is predicted to be important
for full catalytic activity. Sequence analysis revealed

and migration by coupling critical signaling proteins
such as EGFR, ErbB2, PDGFR, C-Abl and p130Cas to
the cytoskeleton and focal adhesions [25]. p130Cas and
its family members are necessary for cell migration and
cancer progression in vitro and in vivo [26-28]. The
Src-p130Cas-Crk complex has been shown to modulate
Rac activity, pseudopodium protrusion, cell migration
and cancer progression [27-30]. We have also shown
that Src is necessary for growth factor- and integrininduced tyrosine phosphorylation of PEAK1 [24].
Together, these findings suggest that integrins and
growth factors may cooperate to activate Src, which in
turn phosphorylates p130Cas on Y165, Y249, or Y410
leading to Crk binding through its SH2 domain. Via its
association with the SH3 domain of Crk, we predict
that PEAK1 assists in the recruitment of Crk to the Srcp130Cas-Crk
scaffold.
PEAK1's
subsequent
phosphorylation by Src on Y665 may function to
facilitate its cytoskeletal or focal adhesion localization
and/or its kinase activation. It is very likely that these
PEAK1-mediated molecular interactions are critical for
the proper dynamic rearrangement of the actin
cytoskeleton and focal adhesions during cell migration,
as cells undergo a significant reduction in their
migratory potential when depleted of PEAK1 protein
[24]. It will be important for future studies to
characterize the role of PEAK1 during early,
proliferative versus late, metastatic stages of cancer
progression. Nevertheless, PEAK1 likely fulfills
several important molecular functions. First, it may
modulate protein-protein interactions by directly
phosphorylating components of the Src-p130Cas-Crk
scaffold via its tyrosine kinase activity. Second, given
that PEAK1 translocates to focal adhesions and the
actin cytoskeleton, it could provide a mechanism to
transport the Src-p130Cas-Crk scaffold to these
structures. Finally, it may deliver unique effector
proteins to these cytoskeletal structures, which in turn
may regulate cell migration and/or proliferation. In any
case, our observations that PEAK1 can interact with
and modulate the Src-p130Cas-Crk-Paxillin and RasRaf-Erk pathways downstream of integrins and
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) point to a central role
for this novel tyrosine kinase during cell migration and
proliferation in normal and transformed cells [24].
Although we are the first to clone and directly study
the function of PEAK1, several independent lines of
evidence also suggest that PEAK1 and its only family
member sgk223 (pragmin) (33% overall homology to
PEAK1) play integral roles in regulating cell motility
and tumor progression [31-32]. For example, sgk223

mediating signaling events through the Srcp130Cas-Crk
and
Ras-Raf-Erk
signaling
pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) and integrins. It is likely that
PEAK1 has both scaffolding and catalytic
functions in these pathways.
Predicted PEAK1-mediated steps during
RTK- or Integrin-induced tumor progression:
1) Ligand/RTK- or Integrin-induced binding of
activated Src (Y416).
2) Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of
p130Cas (Y165, Y249, Y410, etc.).
3) Binding of Crk (SH3 domain) to PEAK1
(P1153) and recruitment of the PEAK1/Crk
complex to phospho-p130Cas - PEAK1
enables multiple Crk molecules to bind to
multiple
phosphotyrosine
residues
on
p130Cas. Enhanced Crk activation and
binding to DOCK180 leads to Rac1 activation,
membrane protrusion and cell migration.
4) Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of
PEAK1 (Y665) leads to enhanced and/or
sustained Src phosphorylation (Y416) and
activation (possibly through PEAK1 tyrosine
kinase activity) - this further enhances
130Cas/Crk coupling and the subsequent
signaling events downstream of Crk
activation.
5) PEAK1 may also promote cell proliferation
and migration through the Ras/Raf/Erk
pathway downstream of RTKs and Integrins,
via its predicted Erk binding (P228) and
substrate (S779/T783) sites.

has been reported to be a novel effector of Rnd2
GTPase, and has also been shown to stimulate RhoA
activity in HeLa cells and mediate cancer cell invasion
in a Src-dependent manner [32]. More recently, sgk223
and PEAK1 were both identified in a quantitative
phosphoproteomics study as potential targets that
mediate Src-induced invasion in advanced colon
carcinoma cells [31]. We have recently demonstrated
that PEAK1 promotes proliferation, migration and
anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumor
formation in vivo [24]. While large shRNA genomic
screens have suggested that PEAK1 is involved in
cancer cell proliferation [33], our recent report is the
first to directly link PEAK1 function with cancer
progression and demonstrate that PEAK1 levels are
amplified in over 80% of colon cancer patients
(primary and metastatic lesions). Notably, this
underscores the importance of understanding the role
of PEAK1 in human cancers (Table 1).
While it is clear now that PEAK1 has intrinsic
tyrosine kinase activity in vitro, future studies should
probe the role of its kinase domain during tumor
progression and identify potential substrates of this
novel
cytoskeleton-associated
kinase.
More
comprehensive mechanistic studies are also warranted
in order to more completely understand how PEAK1
couples to multiple intracellular signaling pathways
and the actin cytoskeleton or focal adhesions to
promote cell proliferation and motility. Specifically, it
will be crucial to elucidate the differential roles for
PEAK1 in the Src-p130Cas-Crk-Paxillin and Ras-RafErk signaling pathways. Finally, understanding the
upstream regulators of PEAK1 and why it is
upregulated in human colon cancers (and whether it is
also upregulated in other human cancers) will likely
help clinical oncologists understand disease
progression. Importantly, PEAK1 is a critical regulator
of multiple cellular processes and its tyrosine kinase
domain may likely provide a novel therapeutic target
for controlling aberrant cellular functions that lead to
cancer.
