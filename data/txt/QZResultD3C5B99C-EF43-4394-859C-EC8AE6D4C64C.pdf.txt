ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSCs), which mediate drug resistance and disease recurrence
in several cancers, are therapeutically relevant to ovarian cancer (OC), wherein
approximately 80% of patients manifest with tumor recurrence. While there are
several markers for ovarian CSCs (OCSCs), the mechanism for their self-renewal
maintenance by unique driver/markers is poorly understood. Here, we evaluated
the role of hPaf1/PD2, a core component of RNA Polymerase II-Associated Factor
(PAF) complex, in self-renewal of OCSCs through marker and functional analyses,
including CRISPR/Cas9-silencing of hPaf1/PD2 in OCSCs and provided a possible
mechanism for maintenance of OCSCs. Expression of hPaf1/PD2 showed moderate to
intense staining in 32.4% of human OC tissues, whereas 67.6% demonstrated basal
expression by immunohistochemistry analysis, implying that the minor proportion
of cells overexpressing hPaf1/PD2 could be putative OCSCs. Isolated OCSCs showed
higher expression of hPaf1/PD2 along with established CSC and self-renewal
markers. Knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 in OCSCs resulted in a significant downregulation
of CSC and self-renewal markers, and impairment of in vitro tumor sphere (P < 0.05)
and colony formation (P = 0.013). Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that OCT3/4
specifically interacts with hPaf1/PD2, and not with other PAF components (Ctr9,
Leo1, Parafibromin) in OCSCs, suggesting a complex-independent role for hPaf1/
PD2 in OCSC maintenance. Moreover, there was a significant overexpression and
co-localization of hPaf1/PD2 with OCT3/4 in OC tissues compared to normal
ovary tissues. Our results indicate that hPaf1/PD2 is overexpressed in OCSCs and
maintains the self-renewal of OCSCs through its interaction with OCT3/4; thus,
hPaf1/PD2 may be a potential therapeutic target to overcome tumor relapse in OC.

INTRODUCTION

patients, treatment usually involves cisplatin and surgical
debulking if disease permits. For patients who do respond
to treatment, the majority of the patients still relapse
within 6–16 months [2].
This relapse may be attributable to a small
population of cancer cells that have the ability to selfrenew and differentiate, commonly known as cancer stem

Ovarian cancer (OC) has the highest mortality
rate among gynecologic cancers in the USA [1]. Due
to its asymptomatic nature, OC is often advanced or
metastatic at the time of diagnosis, with up to 70% of
patients presenting with extra-ovarian disease [1]. In these

cells (CSCs), which have been demonstrated in patients
with OC along with other solid tumors [3–5]. CSCs exhibit
dysregulated cellular pathways, and contribute to not only
disease recurrence, but also drug resistance [3, 6]. This
emphasizes the need to characterize this subset of cancer
cells. It is known that OCSCs express markers such as
CD133, CD44, CD24, CD117, ESA, and ALDH1 but the
mechanisms responsible for OCSC self-renewal remain
largely unknown [7, 8].
hPaf1 (human RNA Polymerase II-Associated
Factor 1)/PD2 (Pancreatic Differentiation 2) is the human
homolog of the yeast Paf1 and is a core component of the
PAF (RNA Polymerase II-Associated Factor) complex [9].
The hPAF complex plays a critical role in the recruitment
of RNA polymerase II to transcripts, thereby participating
in mRNA elongation and 3’ end processing [10, 11].
Moreover, hPaf1/PD2 mediates post-translational histone
modifications such as H3K4 di- and tri-methylation and
H2B monoubiquitination, thereby affecting chromatin
structure [12, 13]. In addition, PAF1 plays a gatekeeper
role for RNA Polymerase II promoter-proximal pausing
in metazoans, and its loss enhances the transcription of
thousands of genes [14, 15]. Apart from PAF complexdependent roles, several studies have documented that
hPaf1/PD2 can function independent of the complex in
specialized biological aspects of cancer, such as cell cycle
progression, acinar to ductal metaplasia in pancreatic
cancer, tumorigenicity, and metastasis [9, 16–18].
Another recent study has proposed that hPaf1/PD2 is a
novel marker for pancreatic CSCs that mediates their
drug resistance [19]. hPaf1/PD2 has also been shown to
regulate the self-renewal process of mouse embryonic
stem cells through its interaction with OCT3/4 [20].
However, the importance and specific function of hPaf1/
PD2 expression in OC and its CSC counterpart has not
been previously investigated.
In the present study, we investigated the involvement
of hPaf1/PD2 in the maintenance of OCSCs. We observed
that knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 resulted in downregulation
of CSC and self–renewal markers with a concomitant
loss of CSC phenotype. Further, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
silencing of hPaf1/PD2 in OC cells resulted in a significant
reduction in percentage of OCSCs. In addition, we
demonstrated the interaction of hPaf1/PD2 with OCT3/4
in OCSCs. Our results indicate that hPaf1/PD2 plays a
major role in the maintenance of self-renewal of OCSCs
through its interaction with OCT3/4.

pattern of hPaf1/PD2 in OC tissues with IHC and
investigated its functional role in OCSCs. Based on the
intensity of staining, tissues were categorized as hPaf1/
PD2negative/basal (intensity = 0), hPaf1/PD2low (intensity = 1)
and hPaf1/PD2high (intensity > 1) (Figure 1A and
Supplementary Table 1). We found that 67.6% (25 out
of 37) of OC tissues showed negative/basal expression
of hPaf1/PD2. Further, the remaining 32.4% (12 out of
37) tissues showed a differential pattern of hPaf1/PD2
staining, ranging from mild to moderate and intense
expression (Figure 1B). Thus, only a sub-population
of human OC tissues exhibited hPaf1/PD2 positive
expression, implying that hPaf1/PD2 overexpressing cells
could be putative OCSCs. This representation of hPaf1/
PD2 in a minor population of OC tissues is in accordance
with the ‘cancer stem cell model’ of tumor evolution [22].
However, basal expression of hPaf1/PD2 is required to
perform normal biological functions such as transcription
elongation and epigenetic modifications [10, 12].

Isolation and characterization of OCSCs from
OC cell lines
In order to determine if hPaf1/PD2 is indeed
overexpressed in OCSCs, we isolated OCSCs or side
population (SP) cells from two OC cell lines. Flow sorting
using Hoechst 33342 staining revealed that OVCAR3
exhibited 3% SP cells, whereas A2780 showed 0.6% SP
cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Isolated SP cells were
cultured under CSC-specific conditions and enriched with
cisplatin (IC20= 2 µM) treatment. Morphologically, SP/
CSCs were very different from non-side population (NSP)
cells: SP cells formed tight circular colonies referred to
as ‘cobblestone structure,’ whereas NSP cells resembled
differentiated cells (Supplementary Figure 2A).
With multiple rounds of cell divisions, the isolated
SP cells can give rise to a heterogeneous population of
CSCs and more differentiated progeny of CSCs by virtue
of their properties of self-renewal and asymmetric division
[23]. Given that CSCs are drug resistant, treatment with
a chemotherapeutic agent such as cisplatin, which is
lethal to differentiated cells, enriches CSCs [24]. This
was validated with an observed morphological difference
between SP cells, in the presence and absence of cisplatin.
OVCAR3 SP cells treated with cisplatin formed a more
‘cobblestone–like’ structure compared to SP cells without
cisplatin treatment (Supplementary Figure 2B). In vitro
tumor sphere formation is a measure of self-renewal and
tumorigenic potential of CSCs, which exploits the ability
of CSCs to grow in a non-adherent culture and form tumor
spheres. We observed a greater number and larger tumor
spheres with SP cells isolated from OVCAR3 compared to
NSP cells, which formed fewer and significantly smaller
tumor spheres (P < 0.02) (Supplementary Figure 2C).
These results indicate that the isolated SP cells represent a
truly distinct population of OCSCs.

ovarian cancer tissues using immunohistochemistry. Tissues were categorized as hPaf1/PD2negative/basal (intensity = 0), hPaf1/PD2low (intensity

cancer tissues was scored as actual percentages. A composite score (CS) was calculated by multiplying intensity and positivity, which
ranges between 0 and 3. The majority of samples (67.6%) exhibited negative /basal expression of hPaf1/PD2, whereas 32.4% showed
low-to-moderate and high expression. (A) Graphical representation of hPaf1/PD2 composite score versus categories of hPaf1/PD2 staining

hPaf1/PD2 is co-overexpressed with established
CSC markers and self-renewal markers in SP
compared to NSP cells

leads to loss of stemness in OCSCs, which affects their
proliferative capacity.
Further, using tumor sphere assay with OVCAR3
SP cells, we observed that hPaf1/PD2 knockdown resulted
in a significant decrease in the number as well as the
diameter of tumor spheres (P < 0.05) (Figure 4B). In
addition, knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 in OVCAR3 SP cells
resulted in greater cell death (Supplementary Figure 3A)
and downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2
(Supplementary Figure 3B), suggesting that silencing
of hPaf1/PD2 leads to greater apoptosis of SP cells.
These results indicate that hPaf1/PD2 plays a role in the
maintenance of OCSCs and that knockdown of hPaf1/PD2
severely affects the CSC phenotype.

We observed that hPaf1/PD2 was significantly
overexpressed in SP cells (OCSCs) isolated from
OVCAR3 compared to NSP cells (non-OCSCs). There
was also a higher expression of CSC markers such as
CD133, CD44, CD24, and ESA, as well as self-renewal
markers such as β-Catenin, SOX-2, OCT3/4, Sonic
Hedgehog (SHH), and Epidermal growth factor family
protein 2 (HER2) (Figure 2A). Similarly, hPaf1/PD2 was
overexpressed in SP cells isolated from A2780 compared
to NSP cells along with CSC markers such as CD133,
CD24, ESA, Lgr5, and self-renewal proteins such as
β-Catenin, SHH, OCT3/4, and SOX-9 by immunoblotting
(Figure 2B). Through immunofluorescence analysis,
we also found a significantly higher co-expression of
hPaf1/PD2 with CSC markers (ESA, and CD44) and
self-renewal proteins (OCT3/4, and SHH) in OVCAR3
SP cells compared to NSP cells (Figure 2C). Moreover,
we observed co-localization of OCT3/4 with hPaf1/PD2
in OVCAR3 SP cells (Figure 2C). These results suggest
that hPaf1/PD2 overexpressing SP cells are the putative
OCSCs because they exhibit higher expression of known
OCSC and self-renewal markers.

CRISPR/Cas9–mediated knockdown of hPaf1/
PD2 decreases the ovarian cancer stem cell
population
Since our experiments were uncovering a role of
hPaf1/PD2 in maintenance of the OCSC phenotype,
we next investigated the impact of loss of hPaf1/PD2
on OCSC population (SP). Utilizing the CRISPR/
Cas9 system, which has emerged as an efficient tool to
modulate gene expression [25, 26], we knocked down
hPaf1/PD2 in OVCAR3 using guide RNA specific for
hPaf1/PD2. We were unable to generate single cell clones
with complete knockout of hPaf1/PD2 as these single cell
clones did not survive, indicating that knockout of hPaf1/
PD2 might be lethal. However, immunoblotting revealed
a robust knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 in pooled population
of transfected OVCAR3 cells as compared to control cells
that were not transfected (Figure 4C). SP analysis in the
pooled population revealed that there was a significant
decrease in proportion of SP cells in OVCAR3 cells
with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated hPaf1/PD2 knockdown
as compared to control cells (P = 0.014) (Figure 4D),
further corroborating the role of hPaf1/PD2 in OCSC
maintenance.

Knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 affects the CSC
phenotype
To investigate whether hPaf1/PD2 plays a role in
the maintenance of OCSCs, we transiently knocked down
hPaf1/PD2 in OVCAR3 SP cells using specific siRNA.
We observed around 80% knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 in
SP cells (Figure 3A), and this knockdown resulted in
a significant reduction in expression of CSC markers
(CD44, CD133, and ESA) as well as of self-renewal
proteins (SHH, β-Catenin, OCT3/4, and SOX-2) analyzed
by immunoblotting (Figure 3A). Similarly, silencing of
hPaf1/PD2 resulted in a marked decrease in expression
of CSC markers (CD44, and ESA) and self–renewal
markers (OCT3/4, and β-Catenin) in OVCAR3 SP cells
analyzed by confocal microscopy (Figure 3B). These
results strongly suggest that hPaf1/PD2 is involved in the
maintenance of OCSCs.
To analyze the functional significance of hPaf1/
PD2 knockdown in OCSCs, we performed an in vitro
tumorigenicity assay (colony formation assay), indicative
of the proliferative capacity of cells, with hPaf1/PD2
silenced OVCAR3 SP cells. The cells transfected with
scramble (Scr) siRNA formed significantly larger and
more numerous colonies compared to hPaf1/PD2 siRNAtransfected cells (P = 0.013) (Figure 4A). It is important
to note that silencing of hPaf1/PD2 resulted in a loss of
characteristic ‘cobblestone-like’ morphology of CSCs
(Figure 4A). This indicates that silencing of hPaf1/PD2

hPaf1/PD2 interacts with OCT3/4 for the
maintenance of ovarian cancer stemness
It has been reported that hPaf1/PD2 is involved in
the maintenance of mouse embryonic stem cells through
its interaction with OCT3/4 [20]. Another study has
demonstrated the transcriptional regulation of OCT3/4
by members of the PAF complex in mouse embryonic
stem cells [27]. Moreover, OCT3/4 is a gatekeeper
for the process of self-renewal in stem cells [28, 29].
Since OCT3/4 showed co-localization and altered
expression along with hPaf1/PD2 in SP cells, we sought
to analyze the interaction between these two proteins.
Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assay showed
a clear interaction between hPaf1/PD2 and OCT3/4
in OVACR3 SP cells (Figure 5A and Figure 5B). In

addition, confocal microscopy revealed co-localization
of OCT3/4 with hPaf1/PD2 in the nuclear and the perinuclear area (Figure 5C). These results strongly suggest
the involvement of hPaf1/PD2 in maintenance of the self–
renewal characteristics of OCSCs through its interaction
with OCT3/4.

Previous studies from our lab have reported
that hPaf1/PD2 can function independent of the PAF
complex in stem cells despite being part of the PAF

complex (PAFC) [19, 20]. To determine whether hPaf1/
PD2 has PAFC independent functions in the context
of OCSCs, we analyzed the expression of other PAFC
components in hPaf1/PD2-silenced OVCAR3 SP cells
through immunoblotting. There was no significant
change in expression of other complex components
(Leo1, Ctr9, and Parafibromin) on knockdown of hPaf1/

PD2 (Figure 5D), suggesting uncoordinated expression
of PAFC components in OCSCs. We further found that
only hPaf1/PD2 interacts with OCT3/4, and there is no
interaction between OCT3/4 and other PAFC components
(Figure 5B). These results suggest that hPaf1/PD2
functions independently of the PAFC in the maintenance
of self-renewal of OCSCs.

focused on targeting these CSCs using molecularly
targeted agents. To date, several CSC markers, such as
CD44, CD133, CD24, ALDH1, and c-kit, have been
identified for OCSCs [3, 31]. However, CSC maintenance
drivers are poorly understood, making it difficult to
target this population. The majority of OC patients have
advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis,
and the standard of care consists of platinum based
chemotherapy with cytoreductive surgery in appropriate
surgical candidates. Despite significant improvements
in the overall survival of OC patients with conventional
therapy, more than 85% of cases relapse. This is in
part due to the development of therapy resistance [32],
which can be mediated by CSCs. Therefore, delineating
the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor relapse and
therapy resistance would pave avenues to devise effective

DISCUSSION
Emerging evidence demonstrates that cancer stem
cells (CSCs) are a small population of specialized cells

therapeutic strategies. In this study, we have investigated
the role of hPaf1/PD2 in the maintenance of self-renewal
of OCSCs.
First, we confirmed the expression of hPaf1/PD2
in clinical samples. Our immunohistochemical analysis
revealed that only a small number of patient tissues
exhibited moderate-to-strongly positive hPaf1/PD2
expression (32.4%), whereas the majority of patients’
tissues showed basal to negative expression (67.6%) in
epithelial OC cells. Previous studies have shown that
hPaf1/PD2 is involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis
[9, 18] and in regulating post-translational modifications
such as histone methylation and chromatin remodeling in
pancreatic cancer cells [12]. Our recent studies have also
shown an association between hPaf1/PD2 with CSCs and
disease aggressiveness [18, 19]. This is the first report to
show the associative and expressional variation of hPaf1/
PD2 in OC patient tissues. Our results demonstrate that
hPaf1/PD2 is overexpressed only in a subpopulation of
cells within the tumor, and that its degree of expression
varies from basal to moderate to strong in this
subpopulation of cells. Thus, hPaf1/PD2 may be important
for a specific population of cells such as CSCs, that can
be further exploited for therapeutic and functional studies.
Further, in addition to human primary pancreatic
and metastatic tumors, the 19q13 chromosomal
locus that contains hPaf1/PD2 gene has been shown
to be amplified in OC cells [33]. We thus wanted to
examine the relevance of hPaf1/PD2 in in vitro and in
vivo settings of OC. Therefore, the second objective
of our study was to isolate side population (SP) and
non-SP (NSP) cells from the A2780 and OVCAR3
cells and validate the expression of CSC markers. SP
cells isolated from both cell lines showed increased
expression of CSC markers (CD133, CD44, CD24,
ESA, and Lgr5), and self-renewal proteins (β-Catenin,
OCT3/4, SHH, SOX-2, SOX-9, and HER2), along
with hPaf1/PD2, as compared to NSP cells. Among
all these global CSC markers, we found hPaf1/PD2
to be significantly overexpressed in specific cells of
OC tissues and CSCs. The expressional co-relation of
hPaf1/PD2 with CSC and self-renewal markers in SP
cells suggested that the hPaf1/PD2 overexpressing SP
cells are putative OCSCs. Similar findings have been
reported by Bailey et al. for pancreatic CSCs, where
they documented that DCLK1 high cells/acetylated
tubulin high cells were also positive for CSC markers
such as CD133 or CD24/CD44/ESA [34]. Previously,
various CSC markers and self-renewal proteins such as
CD133, CD44, ALDH1, ESA, β-Catenin, and SHH were
found to be overexpressed in various cancers, including,
but not limited to, pancreatic, head and neck cancer,
prostate, breast, ovary, and lung cancer [3, 6, 35–39].
We examined the hPaf1/PD2 overexpressing SP cells
for in vitro tumor sphere-forming ability and found that
hPaf1/PD2 expressing SP cells displayed greater number
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of tumor spheres, compared to NSP cells isolated
from the same parental OC cells. Several studies have
documented the ability of CD133+ and CD44+ CSCs
to grow faster and to elicit a highly aggressive nature
compared to their corresponding negative population or
NSP cells [40, 41].
Third, we investigated the biological and
phenotypic effects of hPaf1/PD2 knockdown on the
OCSCs. We observed a marked decrease in expression
of CSC markers, including CD44, CD133, and ESA, as
well as self-renewal proteins such as SHH, β-Catenin,
OCT3/4, and SOX-2 following transient knockdown of
hPaf1/PD2 in OVCAR3 SP cells. Previously, Vaz et al.
had demonstrated that CD133 and MDR2 expression is
reduced upon knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 in pancreatic
CSCs [19]. Of note, through this report we found that
expression of self-renewal and established CSC markers
could be modulated upon hPaf1/PD2 silencing. We
also found that knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 in SP cells
reduced the number of colonies and tumor spheres
formed compared to their respective controls. These data
corroborate the critical role of hPaf1/PD2 in self-renewal
and the tumorigenic property of OCSCs. A similar
observation has been made in another study, wherein
siRNA directed against casein kinase 2 resulted in the
decreased tumor sphere-forming efficiency of SKOV3derived sphere-forming cells, indicating impaired selfrenewal abilities [42]. Further, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 resulted in a significant
decrease in SP in OC cells; further corroborating the role
of hPaf1/PD2 in OCSC maintenance. Our knockdown
studies also alluded to the underlying molecular
mechanisms of the role of hPaf1/PD2 in OCSCs (Figure
7). Specifically, knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 resulted in a
decrease of protein expression of OCT3/4, which has
previously been shown to be associated with maintenance
of self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells [20, 43]
and CSC [44, 45]. Indeed, our studies showed that hPaf1/
PD2 can physically interact with OCT3/4 and participate
in maintenance of OC stemness. On the other hand,
we were not able to detect any possible interaction of
OCT3/4 with other PAF complex components such as
Ctr9, Leo1, and Parafibromin. This suggested a complexindependent function for hPaf1/PD2 on OCT3/4 in
OCSCs.
Several studies have shown the importance of
OCT3/4 in maintaining the self-renewal property of stem
cells and that it is the master regulator of pluripotency
[28, 29]. Moreover, in addition to being expressed in a
large number of cancer cells, OCT3/4 has been reported
to be essential for eliciting CSC-related properties such as
self-renewal and CSC maintenance. Recent studies have
demonstrated OCT3/4 to be highly expressed in liver,
lung, and bladder CSCs and that OCT3/4 participates
in self-renewal, maintenance of CSCs, and regulation
of tumor progression and metastasis [44, 46, 47]. The
14815

interaction of OCT3/4 with hPaf1/PD2 reported here
alludes to a mechanistic role of hPaf1/PD2 in regulating
the self-renewal pathway of OCSCs via its interaction with
OCT3/4.
Finally, we demonstrated that hPaf1/PD2 is
significantly co-overexpressed with ESA and OCT3/4
in OC tissues compared to normal ovary tissues. In this
report, we have shown that hPaf1/PD2 co-localizes
with ESA, CD44, SHH, and OCT3/4 and that the same
markers were decreased upon hPaf1/PD2 knockdown.
This implies a functional and phenotypical relevance
of these established CSC markers with hPaf1/PD2
in OC. A study by Klun et al. has shown putative
CSC markers, such as Nanog, SOX-2, and SSEA-4
to be expressed in the borderline and high-grade OC
specimens [48], suggesting a critical role for these
CSC markers in OC.
In summary, we observed that hPaf1/PD2 is
differentially expressed in human OC tissues and is

overexpressed in OCSCs. Knockdown of hPaf1/PD2
affects the OCSC phenotype as it results in decreased
expression of CSC and self-renewal markers, reduced
colonies and tumor spheres in vitro, and decrease
in the proportion of OCSCs. Moreover, hPaf1/PD2
specifically interacts with OCT3/4 to elicit CSC function
and in clinical settings, hPaf1/PD2 co-expresses with
OCT3/4 and ESA in all stages of human OC with no
such co-expression in normal ovary specimens. It is
quite possible that OCSCs use each of these stem cell
markers with hPaf1/PD2 in a context-dependent manner.
In future studies, we plan to examine the mechanistic
relevance of hPaf1/PD2 with other CSC maintenance
markers. Our data indicate that hPaf1/PD2 is a novel
molecule that might be a maintenance driver for OCSCs,
and that it is responsible for OCSC maintenance through
its interaction with OCT3/4 (Figure 7). Our study also
strongly suggests that hPaf1/PD2 is a novel protein that
can be employed for therapeutic targeting of OCSCs.

Figure 7: Overall scheme depicting the role of hPaf1/PD2 in the maintenance of OCSCs. Ovarian cancer is heterogeneous,

consisting of multiple different cell types including but not limited to cancer cells and cancer stem cells. (A) OCSCs were isolated via
Hoechst33342 staining through flow cytometry and were enriched via culture in CSC-specific media in combination with cisplatin treatment.
(B) OCSCs possess the property of self-renewal which is maintained by hPaf1/PD2 through its interaction with OCT3/4. This interaction
possibly regulates the transcription of downstream self-renewal genes in OCSCs (indicated with the dotted line). (C) Knockdown of hPaf1/
PD2 was performed in OCSCs and its functional implications were analyzed. Loss of hPaf1/PD2 caused (D) a significant decrease in
proportion of OCSCs; (E) downregulation of OCT3/4 and other CSC and self-renewal markers; (F) impairment of colony formation; and
(G) reduction in tumor sphere formation ability of OCSCs; in turn resulting in impaired self-renewal capacity (indicated with the dotted
arrow). Overall, hPaf1/PD2 could be an important target to modulate the self-renewal capacity of OCSCs via its interaction with OCT3/4.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunoblot assay

Cell culture

OVCAR3 and A2780 cell lines were processed
for protein isolation and Western blotting using standard
procedures, as described previously [19]. The following
primary antibodies were used: anti-hPaf1/PD2, antiLeo1, anti-Parafibromin, anti-Ctr9 (Bethyl Laboratories,
Montgomery, TX, USA); anti-OCT3/4, anti-SOX-2,
anti-CD24, anti-ESA, anti-SHH, anti-HER2 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-CD44 (Cell
signalling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA); anti-CD133
(Abnova, Walnut, CA, USA); anti–β-Catenin (Sigma); and
anti-Lgr5, anti-SOX-9 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA)
overnight at 4°C. β-actin was used as a loading control.
The band intensity was quantified using ImageJ and the
normalization was performed as described previously [18].

Human OC cell lines OVCAR3 and A2780 were
obtained from ATCC. A2780 was cultured in DMEM
media (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and 1% penicillinstreptomycin solution (Sigma). OVCAR3 was cultured
in RPMI media (HyClone) supplemented with 20% FBS,
2 mM glutamine (Sigma), 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate
(HyClone), 2.5 g/L dextrose (Sigma), 10 mM HEPES
(Sigma), 10 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 0.01 mg/ml
bovine insulin (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin and 10 µg/ml
streptomycin (Sigma). Cells were subcultured by trypsinEDTA treatment with complete medium changed every
other day.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was
performed as described previously [49]. We used our inhouse generated, anti-PD2 mouse monoclonal antibody at
a dilution of 1:500 and performed overnight incubation
[9]. hPaf1/PD2 expression in human ovarian tissues
was scored by a UNMC pathologist using double blind
conditions. Each sample was given a composite score (CS)
based on intensity and extent of tissue staining. Intensity
was graded on a four-point scale of 0–3 (0− no staining, 1+
weakly positive, 2+ moderately positive and 3+ strongly
positive). The extent of hPaf1/PD2-positive staining in
human OC tissues was scored as actual percentages. A
composite score (CS) was calculated by multiplying the
intensity and positivity, which ranged between 0 and 3.

Human ovarian cancer tissues and tissue array
Paraffin embedded human OC tissues (n = 37) were
obtained from the UNMC tissue bank. Samples were
obtained following protocol approval by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) at the University of Nebraska
Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska. OC tissue array
(OV243), which consists of normal ovary tissues (n = 6)
and tissues of different OC stages (n = 18) was obtained
from US Biomax (Rockville, MD, USA).

Isolation of side population (SP) and non-side
population (NSP) from cancer cell lines
Side population (SP) cells or putative CSCs
were isolated using flow sorting following Hoechst
33342 (AnaSpec Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) staining
as described previously [19]. Gating to identify the
characteristic SP was aided with the inclusion of a
Verapamil (Sigma) control, a calcium channel blocker
that reverses the drug resistance phenotype. The
remaining population with higher intensity of Hoechst
stain that fell outside the gate was designated as the
‘non-side population’ (NSP).

Immunofluorescence analysis
Cells were plated, fixed and processed as described
previously [19]. Primary antibodies specific for rabbithPaf1/PD2 (1:100 in PBS), rabbit-SHH (1:100), mouseOCT3/4 (1:100), rabbit-β-Catenin (1:100), mouse-CD44
(1:250) and rabbit-ESA (1:1500) were used with a 4 h
incubation for cells. For the tissue array, we followed the
same procedure mentioned previously [49], but incubation
with primary antibodies was performed overnight at 4oC.
Following primary antibody incubation, the cells and
tissue sections were processed using standard procedures
as described previously [19].

CSC-specific cell culture
Stem cell-specific medium was used for the culture
of isolated SP and NSP cells as described previously
[19]. SP and NSP fractions obtained via flow sorting
from OVCAR3 and A2780 were grown in RPMI,
supplemented with 20% FBS and other OVCAR3
supplements and DMEM with 10% FBS, respectively,
for a day to allow the cells to acclimatise. The cells were
then transferred to a stem cell-specific medium. SP cells
were treated with 2 µM cisplatin (IC20) for enriching the
CSC population.

Knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 using specific siRNA
Transient knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 was
performed using hPaf1/PD2 siRNA (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), which is a pool of 3 target-specific
19–25 nt siRNAs. OVCAR3 SP cells were plated in a 6
well plate at a concentration of 0.6 million/well. On the
following day, the cells were serum starved for 4 h, and
14817

Oncotarget

Immunoprecipitation analysis

then transfected with hPaf1/PD2 siRNA or non-targeting
control siRNA (scramble siRNA) at a concentration of
100 pmol/ well. Serum containing medium was added
to the cells 4 hours after transfection. The medium was
changed every 24 h and lysates were collected 72 h after
transfection.

OVCAR3 SP cells were treated with an
amine reactive protein cross linker, DSP ((dithiobis
(succinimidyl propionate)) (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA), to stabilize the interaction
according to manufacturer’s instructions. The lysate
was collected in a non-denaturing immunoprecipitation
buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40,
10% Glycerol, 1 mM DTT). Immunoprecipitation was
performed with anti-hPaf1/PD2 (rabbit polyclonal, Bethyl
Laboratories) and anti-OCT3/4 (mouse monoclonal,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies as described
previously [12]. The immunoprecipitates or total cell
lysates were transferred onto the PVDF membrane after
being resolved on 10% SDS PAGE, and thereafter were
incubated overnight at 4oC with primary antibodies (antihPaf1/PD2, anti-OCT3/4, anti-Leo1, anti-Ctr9, antiparafibromin).

Colony formation assay (clonogenic assay) with
hPaf1/PD2 knockdown in SP cells
OVCAR3 SP cells were transfected with 100
pmol/ well of Paf1 siRNA or scramble (Scr) siRNA as
described in the previous section. 24 h later, the cells were
trypsinized and seeded at a density of 1000 cells/well in a
6 well plate in triplicates. The cells were cultured in CSCspecific media, with media changed once in two days.
After 2 weeks of growth, cells were imaged using the
Motic AE 2000 microscope with an attached Moticam5
camera to capture the gross morphological variations
between hPaf1/PD2 knockdown cells and scramble
siRNA transfected cells. Thereafter, the cells were fixed
with 100% methanol and stained with crystal violet stain
(0.1%, w/v in 20 nm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid;
Sigma) before the colonies started to merge. The staining
was quantified using ImageJ and the graph was plotted
using MedCalc software.

Statistical analysis
Student t-test was used to determine the statistical
significance between control and hPaf1/PD2 knockdown
group in all the experiments pertaining to this study.
Statistical analysis and generation of graphs were
performed using MedCalc software. P value of less than
0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Error
bars were given on the basis of calculated standard error
values.

Tumor sphere assay
OVCAR3 SP cells transfected with hPaf1/PD2
siRNA or Scr siRNA were seeded in triplicates in a 24 well
non-adherent plate (Corning Inc., Corning, New York,
USA) in CSC-specific media at a concentration of 100
cells/well. The cells in suspension culture were observed
under the microscope and fresh media was added every
alternate day without removing the existing media. A week
later, multiple images were taken per well for different
fields of view. The diameter of each tumor sphere was
measured using Motic Images Plus 2.0 ML software; the
dot plot depicting the diameter of tumor sphere in hPaf1/
PD2 knockdown cells and Scr siRNA treated cells was
plotted using MedCalc software.

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated hPaf1/PD2 knockdown

FINANCIAL SUPPORT

hPaf1/PD2 knockdown in OVCAR3 cells was
performed using CRISPR/Cas9 system [50]. Briefly,
cells were transfected with hPaf1/PD2 guide RNA
(5’- ACCTACCGCATCGACCCCAA -3’) containing
CRISPR/Cas9 vector (pSpCas9 BB-2A-GFP PX458)
(Genescript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). 72 h later, GFP
positive cells were isolated and the pooled population
was collected in a 12 well plate by flow sorting. Cells
were allowed to grow in to colonies, which were then
analyzed for expression of hPaf1/PD2 by immunoblot
analysis.
