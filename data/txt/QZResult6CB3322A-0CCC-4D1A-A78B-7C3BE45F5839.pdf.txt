ABSTRACT
Classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are hematopoietic stem cell
disorders that exhibit excess mature myeloid cells, bone marrow fibrosis, and
risk of leukemic transformation. Aberrant JAK2 signaling plays an etiological role
in MPN formation. Because neoplastic cells in patients are largely insensitive to
current anti-JAK2 therapies, effective therapies remain needed. Members of the
PIM family of serine/threonine kinases are induced by JAK/STAT signaling, regulate
hematopoietic stem cell growth, protect hematopoietic cells from apoptosis, and
exhibit hematopoietic cell transforming properties. We hypothesized that PIM kinases
may offer a therapeutic target for MPNs. We treated JAK2-V617F-dependent MPN
model cells as well as primary MPN patient cells with the PIM kinase inhibitors
SGI-1776 and AZD1208 and the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. While MPN model cells
were rather insensitive to PIM inhibitors, combination of PIM inhibitors with
ruxolitinib led to a synergistic effect on MPN cell growth due to enhanced apoptosis.
Importantly, PIM inhibitor mono-therapy inhibited, and AZD1208/ruxolitinib
combination therapy synergistically suppressed, colony formation of primary MPN
cells. Enhanced apoptosis by combination therapy was associated with activation of
BAD, inhibition of downstream components of the mTOR pathway, including p70S6K
and S6 protein, and activation of 4EBP1. Importantly, PIM inhibitors re-sensitized
ruxolitinib-resistant MPN cells to ruxolitinib by inducing apoptosis. Finally, exogenous
expression of PIM1 induced ruxolitinib resistance in MPN model cells. These data
indicate that PIMs may play a role in MPNs and that combining PIM and JAK2 kinase
inhibitors may offer a more efficacious therapeutic approach for MPNs over JAK2
inhibitor mono-therapy.

an elevated risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia.
Traditional therapies have included chemotherapy,
phlebotomy, and other palliative approaches to relieve
patient symptoms. Other than stem cell transplantation,
which is not an option for most patients, there is no
curative therapy for MPNs [4].
Classical MPNs are driven by aberrant JAK2
activation and signaling, presumably through known
JAK2 effector pathways including STAT5, ERK, and
Akt [5]. The JAK2-V617F activating mutation is observed

INTRODUCTION
Myeloproliferative neoplasms were first recognized
in 1951 and today, classical Philadelphia chromosomenegative MPNs include polycythemia vera (PV), essential
thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)
[1, 2]. These neoplasms are clonal hematopoietic stem/
progenitor cell diseases that lead to a combination of
erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and scarring
of the bone marrow [3]. Myelofibrosis patients also have

in nearly all cases of PV and about half of the cases of
ET and PMF [6]. In addition to JAK2-V617F, mutations
in exon 12 of JAK2 as well as JAK2 activating mutations
in other signaling proteins, such as Mpl and Lnk, are
found in MPNs [6–9]. CalR mutations are found in the
majority of MPN patients that do not contain a JAK2 or
Mpl mutation [10]. While the ability of mutant CalR to
activate STAT5 signaling is not completely clear, such
cells do express a gene expression profile consistent with
activation of the JAK2-STAT5 pathway as in JAK2mutant positive MPNs [11]. While this genetic data
alone suggests JAK2 activation plays an etiologic role in
MPNs, a plethora of mouse models have demonstrated
that expression of JAK2-V617F, as well as other JAK2activating mutations found in MPNs, can generate human
MPN-like phenotypes in mice [8, 9, 12–19].
The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was approved for
some myelofibrosis patients in 2011 and for hydroxyurea
resistant or intolerant PV patients in 2014 [20]. However,
ruxolitinib, like other clinically tested JAK2 inhibitors, is
unable to appreciably reduce allele burden in patients and
thus does not induce remission. However, it does reduce
constitutional symptoms associated with the disease, an
effect believed to be due to the ability of the drug to inhibit
JAK1 activation in the cytokine storm that is associated
with MPNs [21]. Importantly, it was reported that
ruxolitinib treatment might increase survival in high-risk
myelofibrosis patients [22–24]. Nonetheless, it became
evident that the neoplastic cells of MPN patients quickly
developed resistance to JAK2 inhibitors.
Because JAK2 signaling is not suppressed long term
and molecular remission is not observed in patients treated
with JAK2 inhibitors, combination therapies have been
investigated. Such combinations include JAK2 inhibitors
with other signaling inhibitors such as inhibitors of
PI3K/Akt and mTOR [25–29], as well as with drugs that
decrease JAK2 expression and thus sensitize cells to JAK2
inhibition [30–33]. STAT5 is required for JAK2-V617Finduced MPN in mice [34, 35], and a JAK/STAT gene
expression signature is observed in MPNs [11]. These
data suggest STAT5 transcriptional targets play a role in
MPNs and thus provide possible targets for therapeutic
intervention.
Members of the PIM family of proto-oncogenes
are STAT transcriptional targets [36–39]. PIMs are serine
threonine kinases that cooperate with cMyc to induce
lymphomagenesis in mice [40–43]. The anti-apoptotic
signaling activity of PIMs likely contributes to their
transforming activity [38, 44, 45]. PIMs are constitutively
active kinases, possibly because of the unique kinase
domain hinge region [46]. Thus, PIM activity is regulated
via protein expression through transcriptional activation
(e.g. JAK/STAT signaling) and regulation of protein
turnover [42, 44, 46, 47]. Recent work has determined
that PIM1 plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell
growth and viability [48]. This is presumably through
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

downstream pathways regulated by PIM kinase activity,
which include, among others, the apoptotic activity of
BAD and regulation of the mTOR pathway [42, 47]. PIM
family members are therapeutic targets to consider in
MPNs for numerous reasons, including their regulation of
expression/activity by JAK2/STAT signaling, their ability
to regulate hematopoietic stem cell growth, and their
ability to inhibit apoptosis and function as hematopoietic
oncogenes. Importantly, JAK2-V617F cannot induce
PIM1 expression or an MPN phenotype in mice lacking
STAT5 [35]. Finally, the lack of significant phenotype in
PIM triple knockout mice suggests specific targeting of
PIMs may not have overt adverse effects. Indeed, PIM
inhibitors have demonstrated effectiveness as a therapeutic
in a number of types of cancer models, including models
of various hematopoietic cancers [49–55].
In this study we utilized a highly specific and
effective PIM inhibitor, AZD1208 [52], and determined
its effect on MPN cells alone and in combination with
the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Our data suggest primary
MPN patient cells are sensitive to AZD1208 mono-therapy
while AZD1208 mono-therapy has limited effect on MPN
model cell lines. In combination with ruxolitinib, however,
AZD1208 synergistically enhances the inhibitory effect of
the JAK2 inhibitor in both MPN model cells and primary
cells from MPN patients. In addition, AZD1208 can
re-sensitize ruxolitinib resistant cells to undergo apoptosis
in the presence of the JAK2 inhibitor and exogenous PIM1
expression can induce ruxolitinib resistance in JAK2 or
Mpl driven cells. These data suggest targeting PIMs may
enhance the efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors in MPNs.

RESULTS
PIM inhibitors have little effect on MPN model
cell lines
To begin investigating the role of PIMs in signaling
by JAK2-V617F, we treated MPN model cells with the
pan PIM inhibitor SGI-1776 [56]. Even at single digit
micromolar doses, SGI-1776 had little effect on the
growth of MPN model cells, including JAK2-V617Fpositive HEL and SET2 cells (Fig. 1A). However, high
dose of SGI-1776 (10 μM) proved very toxic to these cells
(Fig. 1A). Given the high dose required and the fact that
SGI-1776 is also a potent inhibitor of TrkA and Flt3 [56],
we wanted to utilize a more effective and selective PIM
kinase inhibitor. AZD1208 is a recently developed, highly
effective, pan-PIM kinase inhibitor [52]. The IC50 of
AZD1208 for PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3 is 0.4 nM, 5.0 nM,
and 1.9 nM respectively, values that are over an order
of a magnitude improved compared to that reported for
SGI-1776 [52, 56]. After PIMs, the kinase with the next
highest affinity for AZD1208 has a binding constant that
is over 43-fold higher than observed for PIMs [52]. The

was determined to be 10 nM, 151 nM, and 102 nM,
respectively [52]. Thus, AZD1208 is a highly selective
and efficacious PIM inhibitor. We treated MPN model
cell lines, including JAK2-V617F-positive HEL, Uke1,
and SET2 cells, and BAF3 cells that are transformed by
the expression of JAK2-V617F (BaF3-JAK2-V617F),
with AZD1208 and again saw little effect on cell growth
and viability (Fig. 1B and not shown). In fact, the dose
response curve for AZD1208 in these MPN model cells,
which are routinely used to test MPN therapeutics, was not
a classical sigmoidal shape, but rather was nearly linear
(Fig. 1B). As seen in Fig. 1B, the IC50s of AZD1208 for
MPN model cell lines were approximately 10 μM. This
suggested that perhaps PIMs may not play a critical role in
the growth of these MPN cell lines, which are dependent
on signaling by JAK2-V617F.

PIM inhibitors. In HEL and SET2 cells combination
treatment effectively prevented the growth of the culture
of cells over the course of the experiment (HEL: 3 days,
SET2: 10 days) (Fig. 2A). While synergy was apparent
in the data, formal synergy analyses demonstrated that
this combination therapy indeed resulted in synergy
(combination index less than 1) in both HEL and Uke1
cells (Fig. 2B) in all combinations of drug concentrations
tested, with the exception of one combination in Uke1
cells. A combination of AZD1208 with ruxolitinib also
effectively prevented the growth of MPN model cell lines,
including HEL and BAF3-JAK2-V617F cells (Fig. 2C).
Similar results were observed with SET2 cells treated
with the inhibitors (data not shown). Again, combination
indices of less than one were obtained when these two
drugs were combined and used against both HEL and
Uke1 cells (Fig. 2D). This demonstrated combining these
two drugs also has a synergistic effect against MPN model
cell lines. Importantly, combining ruxolitinib and SGI1776 did not affect the growth of K562 cells, a myeloid
cell line that’s growth is not driven by JAK2-V617F but
rather by BCR-ABL (not shown) and ruxolitinib and
AZD1208 either in mono-therapy or in combination did
not have any effect on Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells (not
shown). This suggests that the combination of ruxolitinib
and PIM inhibitors does not have a non-specific effect on
cell growth.

PIM inhibitors synergize with JAK2 inhibition
against MPN cell growth and viability
While PIM inhibitors alone did not affect JAK2V617F-driven growth, we wanted to determine if PIM
inhibition could affect the extent of cell growth inhibition
elicited by a JAK2 inhibitor. In this combination therapy,
we observed synergistic effects on cell growth when the
JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was combined with either
SGI-1776 (Fig. 2A & 2B) or AZD1208 (Fig. 2C & 2D)

PIM inhibitors synergize with JAK2 inhibition
to induce apoptotic cell death

PIM inhibitors inhibit erythropoietinindependent colony formation of primary
MPN cells

The mechanism by which combination of PIM and
JAK2 inhibition inhibited cell growth appeared to be
induction of cell death. Combination of AZD1208 and
ruxolitinib induced augmented loss of cell viability over
time compared to either drug alone at the concentrations
used, as seen in BaF3-JAK2-V617F and HEL cells
(Fig. 3A). These results were also observed in SET2
cells treated with the inhibitors (data not shown). In
addition, combining the two drugs resulted in enhanced
apoptotic cell death as determined by annexin V
binding (Fig. 3B). While AZD1208 had no effect on
cell death at the concentrations utilized, ruxolitinib
alone and in a dose dependent manner enhanced the
percent of the cell population that was undergoing
apoptosis, as expected (Fig. 3B). However, the number
of cells undergoing apoptosis was further induced by
the presence of AZD1208, even though alone it did not
induce significant cell death, resulting in a synergistic
response (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained in all
JAK2-V617F-dependent MPN model cell lines tested,
including Uke1, BaF3-JAK2-V617F, and HEL (Fig. 3B)
and SET2 (Supplementary Fig. 1A). PARP cleavage
correlated with enhanced annexin binding in Uke1,
BAF3-JAK2-V617F, and HEL cells (Fig. 3C) and SET2
cells (Supplementary Fig. 1B), confirming combined
ruxolitinib and AZD1208 treatment led to enhanced
apoptotic cell death compared to ruxolitinib treatment
alone. A known PIM substrate is the pro-apoptotic
protein BAD [42, 44, 45, 47]. Because PIMs are known
to inactivate BAD by phosphorylation we analyzed the
status of BAD phosphorylation in drug treated cells.
A decrease in serine-112 phosphorylated BAD, which
was not due to a decrease in BAD protein, was observed
concomitant with an increase in the presence of cleaved
PARP (Fig.  3C and Supplementary Fig. 1B). In all
three lines tested BAD serine-112 phosphorylation was
decreased the most by combination of ruxolitinib and
AZD1208, corresponding to the enhanced apoptosis
detected in cells treated with the combination of drugs
(Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. 1A and 1B). Finally,
to determine if combining ruxolitinib and AZD1208
affected the growth rate by affecting the cell cycle in
addition to inducing apoptosis, we analyzed the cell
cycle in treated cells. Combination treatment had no
effect on the percent of cells in each phase of the cell
cycle compared to ruxolitinib treated cells (data not
shown). Together these data suggest the combinatorial
effect on cell growth and viability that is observed with
concomitant treatment with JAK2 and PIM inhibitors is
due to enhanced induction of apoptotic cell death.

In order to test the effect of PIM inhibition on
primary cells from MPN patients, we utilized the
characteristic ability of MPN progenitor cells to form
erythropoietin-independent erythroid colonies (EEC)
in methylcellulose [57, 58]. SGI-1776 inhibited EEC
formation of the two MPN patient (both JAK2-V617Fpositive) samples tested (Fig. 4A). Likewise, AZD1208
also inhibited EEC formation of cells from three
additional JAK2-V617F-positive MPN patients and in a
dose dependent manner (Fig. 4B) (see legend of Fig. 4
for more details). Interestingly, this is unlike what we
observed in cell lines where PIM inhibitors alone were
relatively ineffective (Fig. 1). Treatment of PBMCs from
healthy controls showed no inhibition of erythroid colony
formation by either SGI-1776 (Fig. 4A) or AZD1208
(Fig. 4B).
While JAK2 inhibitors inhibit EEC formation
of primary MPN progenitor cells, we next tested the
ability of PIM inhibition to augment the effect of JAK2
inhibition of EEC colony formation. To do this we
utilized concentrations of both AZD1208 and ruxolitinib
that would each elicit about 50% inhibition of colony
growth. Thus, for these experiments we utilized 100 or
200 nM AZD1208 and 10–100 nM ruxolitinib, with most
samples being treated with 100 or 200 nM AZD1208
and 50 nM ruxolitinib. Combining these two drugs
resulted in an augmented effect on the inhibition of EEC
formation of PBMCs isolated from MPN patients. Fig. 4C
shows the effect of AZD1208 and ruxolitinib, alone
and in combination, on EEC formation of primary cells
from twelve JAK2-V617F-positive MPN patients. The
response to drugs was somewhat variable, as expected
with primary cells from different patients, but in all cases
tested we observed a significant enhancement of growth
inhibition, and in many cases a synergistic response, by
the combination of ruxolitinib and AZD1208 (Fig. 4C).
Comparison of the amount of inhibition of colony
formation induced by JAK2 inhibition to the combination
treatment in all samples tested, demonstrated that the
combination treatment induced a statistically significant
enhancement of inhibition of primary MPN cell colony
formation (Fig. 4D).

Maximal effect was again observed upon co-treatment
with AZD1208 and ruxolitinib. Finally, we observed
inhibition of phosphorylation of 4EBP1 (Thr-37/
Thr-46) by both AZD1208 and ruxolitinib. While we
utilized an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated
Thr-37 and/or Thr-46 of 4EBP1, we also observed an
increase in the mobility of 4EBP1 that is indicative of
the loss of hyperphosphorylation of 4EBP1 (Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Fig. 2A). Again the combination of
AZD1208 and ruxolitinib provided maximally observed
decreases in 4EBP1 phosphorylation. The decreases
in phosphorylation of p70S6K, S6, and 4EBP1, which
were not due to a decrease in levels of these proteins
(Supplementary Fig. 2A and 2B), suggest that combining
AZD1208 and ruxolitinib enhances inhibition of
downstream components of the mTOR pathway. It
should be noted that while PIM protein levels can be
controlled by JAK2/STAT5 signaling, the low doses of
ruxolitinib utilized to demonstrate combinatorial effects
do not completely eliminate PIM protein expression
(Supplementary Fig. 2A). Finally, we observed similar
effects of AZD1208 and ruxolitinib on phosphorylation of
p70S6K and S6 in primary granulocytes from a PV patient

to ruxolitinib, as previously described [60]. JAK2
mutations were not selected for (or detected) in these
cells, consistent with Koppikar et al. [60]. Because PIM1
and 2 are regulated by STAT5 activation, and thus are
downstream effectors of JAK2 signaling, we checked
the expression of all three PIM family members in these
cells that are able to grow in the presence of high levels
of JAK2 inhibitor it is redundant and shouldn’t be there
and compared expression levels to ruxolitinib sensitive
cells. In general, and as expected, both PIM1 and PIM
2 mRNA levels were sensitive to ruxolitinib treatment
in ruxolitinib sensitive cells. This was observed in all
three lines tested, including HEL, SET2, and Uke1
(Supplementary Fig. 4A). PIM3 expression, however, was
less responsive to ruxolitinib, as inconsistent decreases
were observed. In ruxolitinib persistent cells growing
in the chronic presence of the drug, PIM mRNA levels
were elevated compared to the levels observed with acute
downregulation in drug sensitive cells (Supplementary
Fig. 4A). In all cell lines, mRNA levels of two PIM
family members reached 50% to nearly 100% that
observed as steady state levels of drug sensitive cells.
PIM1 and PIM2 protein levels were decreased by acute
high dose ruxolitinib treatment, while PIM3 protein
was not significantly affected (Supplementary Fig. 4B).
Expression of all three PIM family members was readily
observed in ruxolitinib persistent cells growing in 1 μM
ruxolitinib (Supplementary Fig. 4B and Supplementary
Fig. 6), where PIM protein levels were equal to or greater
than control/uninhibited levels (Supplementary Fig. 4B).
This suggested that the expression of PIMs may play a

Figure 6: MPN cells that persistently grow in the presence of JAK2 inhibitors are still sensitive to the combination
of ruxolitinib and AZD1208. A. Ruxolitinib persistent Uke1-R and BaF3-JAK2-V617F-R cells growing in 1 μM ruxolitinib were
plated in 1 μM ruxolitinib and 0.1 or 0.5 μM AZD1208, as indicated. Relative viable cells were determined by MTS assay after 72 hours.
B. Ruxolitinib persistent BaF3-JAK2-V617F-R cells were cultured in 1 μM ruxolitinib alone or with 0.25 or 0.5 μM AZD1208 and total
viable cells were determined over time by trypan blue exclusion. C. BaF3-JAK2-V617F-R cells growing in 1 μM ruxolitinib were treated
with ruxolitinib alone, 0.25 μM AZD1208, or the combination of the two drugs. Cell viability after two and four days was determined by
trypan blue exclusion. D. Apoptosis in BaF3-JAK2-V617F-R cells treated with 1 μM ruxolitinib, 0.25 μM AZD1208, or a combination of
the two drugs was detected with annexin V staining and flow cytometry after 24, 48, and 72 hours. Error bars indicate standard deviation.

role in the ruxolitinib resistant state. To test this we treated
ruxolitinib persistent cells, which were continuously
growing in the presence of ruxolitinib, with AZD1208.
AZD1208 treatment of ruxolitinib persistent Uke1
(Uke1-R) and BaF3-JAK2-V617F-R cells growing in
1 μM of ruxolitinib resulted in growth inhibition (Fig. 6A)
in a short term MTS assay. Similar results were obtained
with SET2-R and HEL-R cells (not shown) as well as
with the PIM inhibitor SGI-1776 (Supplementary Fig. 5).
To investigate longer-term growth we treated ruxolitinib
persistent BaF3-JAK2-V617F-R cells with AZD1208.
Over an eleven-day time course, persistent cells growing
in 1 μM ruxolitinib increased in cell number about
1000-fold that of the same cells treated with AZD1208
(Fig. 6B). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with
ruxolitinib persistent Uke1-R cells (not shown). AZD1208
treatment of ruxolitinib persistent BaF3-JAK2-V617F-R
cells resulted in a substantial loss in cell viability
(Fig. 6C) and this loss was due to a significant induction
of apoptosis (Fig. 6D). These ruxolitinib-persistent cells
growing in 1 μM ruxolitinib had a stable steady state level
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of annexin V positive cells (about 8%). However, the
addition of AZD1208 to these cells enhanced the percent
of annexin V positive cells to as high as 47% (Fig. 6D).
AZD1208 alone had no effect on ruxolitinib persistent
cells in the absence of the JAK2 inhibitor (Fig. 6C). Thus,
cells exhibiting ruxolitinib persistent growth, and which
maintain elevated PIM protein levels (Supplementary
Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 6), could be
re-sensitized to apoptosis by the concomitant treatment
with AZD1208. AZD1208 treatment of ruxolitinib
persistent cells did not affect the activation state of
JAK2 signaling effectors, suggesting AZD1208 is not
altering JAK2 activation and signaling in these cells
(Supplementary Fig. 6).

PIM1 expression is sufficient to induce

Our data suggest PIM inhibition synergizes with
ruxolitinib to induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in
MPN model cells. In addition, while JAK2 inhibition

is augmented in cells that are resistant to JAK2 inhibitors
(Supplementary Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 6).
Also, PIM proteins can function as oncogenes themselves
under certain conditions. Taken together, we wanted
to determine if aberrant PIM expression could induce
JAK2 inhibitor resistance. To do this we expressed PIM1
in BaF3 cells transformed to cytokine independence by
JAK2-V617F. These cells depend on activated JAK2
for growth, and our expression of PIM1 via a retroviral
promoter would effectively uncouple the expression of
PIM1 from the control of JAK2/STAT5 signaling. We
expressed both the long and short forms of PIM1 in these

experiments (Fig. 7A). PIM1L was expressed at a higher
level than PIM1S, which could only be detected following
proteasome treatment of cells (Fig. 7A). As expected,
proteasome treatment increased both exogenous and
endogenous PIM1 protein levels (Fig. 7A). Expression of
PIM1 in BaF3-JAK2-V617F cells did not alter their rate
of cytokine independent growth (Fig. 7B, first graph).
While BaF3-JAK2-V617F cells expressing a control
vector remain sensitive to the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib,
the expression of PIM1 in these cells led to an outgrowth
of cells that could persistently grow in the presence of
ruxolitinib (Fig. 7B, second and third graphs)). PIM1L was
much more effective at inducing ruxolitinib resistance than

Figure 7: Exogenous expression of PIM1 induces ruxolitinib resistance. A. PIM1L and PIM1S were expressed from a viral

promoter in BaF3-JAK2-V617F cells. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for PIM1, actin as a loading control, and MDM2 for a proteasome
inhibitor control. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was utilized to stabilize PIM1 expression for easier detection of PIM1S. The
exogenous PIM1 proteins were FLAG-tagged thus increasing their molecular weight and slowing their mobility in SDS-PAGE compared
to endogenous PIM1 proteins. Mobility of endogenous and exogenous PIM1 proteins are indicated with arrows. B. These cells from A.,
along with vector control, were cultured with DMSO or ruxolitinib (0.5 μM and 1.0 μM) and total viable cells were determined over time
by trypan blue exclusion. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.

PIM1S, presumably due to the higher level of exogenous
PIM1L. PIM1L expression was able to induce resistance
to 0.5 and 1.0 μM ruxolitinib, with continued proliferation
of the cells. Of note, expression of PIM1 proteins in
parental IL-3-dependent BaF3 cells did not induce
cytokine independent growth (not shown), suggesting the
outgrowth of PIM1-expressing JAK2-V617F-transformed
cells was not due to the ability of exogenous PIM1
to transform these cells on its own. Exogenous PIM1
expression similarly induced ruxolitinib resistance in 32D
myeloid cells transformed by the MPN oncogenic protein
Mpl-W515L (Supplementary Fig. 7). These data suggest
PIM proteins may be sufficient to induce JAK2 inhibitor
resistance and the expression of PIM proteins may play a
role, downstream of re-activated JAK2 signaling, in the
development of JAK2 inhibitor resistance.

were not inhibited at 1 μM. The ability of AZD1208 to
block primary MPN cell colony formation and not MPN
cell line growth may be due to the importance of PIMs
in the proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells [48], which are responsible for colony development
in hematopoietic colony formation assays. It is possible
AZD1208 may differentially target signaling pathways
in primary cells compared to cell lines. Alternatively, the
expression of PIM family proteins in erythroid progenitors
may be lower than in cell lines, thus making such cells
more sensitive to AZD1208. However, the lack of a
significant dose-response effect in cell lines (Fig. 1), in
particular at very high inhibitor doses, suggests PIM levels
would likely not be the sole reason for this discrepancy
in sensitivity to AZD1208. Complexity is added by the
fact that AZD1208 is a pan-PIM inhibitor of the three
PIM members [52]. It is quite possible that cell lines have
different signaling than primary cells that may make them
more resistant to PIM inhibition. For example, PIM and
Akt substrates overlap and thus differential Akt activity
in cell lines, compared to primary cells, could mask
the effect of PIM inhibition. With this said, it is worth
noting that our results suggest that experiments aimed at
the development of potential MPN therapeutics should
consider the use of primary samples, even in the face of
negative results with MPN cell lines. In a more general
sense, our results exemplify the potential to generate
mis-leading/less accurate conclusions from data solely
obtained using established cell lines.
PIM1 knockout and PIM1 transgenic expression
inhibits and enhances hematopoiesis, respectively,
providing evidence of a role for this serine threonine
kinase in hematopoietic malignancies [48]. Because
PIM1 transgenic overexpression in mice enhances
hematopoiesis, chronic PIM1 expression in MPNs by
constitutive JAK2/STAT5 signaling may contribute to
aberrant hematopoiesis in MPNs. As ruxolitinib monotherapy is unable to reduce allele burden/induce remission
in patients, a treatment strategy that increases neoplastic
stem/progenitor cell death is needed. The ability of
AZD1208 to enhance ruxolitinib-induced apoptosis of
JAK2-V617F-driven cells is thus significant (Fig.  3).
Using different small molecules, Huang et al. also
demonstrated PIM inhibition enhances the efficacy of
JAK2 inhibitor therapy [54]. Our work demonstrating
that AZD1208 synergizes with ruxolitinib to inhibit
primary MPN cell colony formation provides additional
and significant pre-clinical data that PIM inhibition may
increase the therapeutic efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors
(Fig. 4).
PIM inhibitor treatment in different hematological
disease models does not result in consistent effects on
cell signaling, and thus PIMs may play different roles in
different cancers. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the
PIM inhibitor SGI-1776 induces apoptosis by decreasing

DISCUSSION
The lack of efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors in patients is
a major roadblock in the development of effective targeted
therapies for MPNs. Because ineffective JAK2 inhibition
leaves JAK2 signaling intact, combination therapies are
actively being investigated. Heat shock protein inhibitors
and histone deacetylase inhibitors destabilize JAK2
and thus render cells more sensitive to JAK2 inhibitors
[30–33]. Combination therapies with agents that target
signaling molecules downstream of JAK2 have also been
investigated. Inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR, for example,
have been shown to be effective in MPN models and in
combination with JAK2 inhibitors [25–29].
In this report we demonstrate that PIM inhibitors
synergize with JAK2 inhibitors against MPN cell growth
and viability. We chose to target PIM kinases for numerous
reasons, including: 1. members of the PIM family of genes
are transcriptionally activated by JAK/STAT5 signaling
[42, 46, 47]; 2. PIMs are constitutively active kinases
regulated by expression through transcription and protein
stability [42, 44, 46, 47]; 3. STAT5 is required for MPN
formation in mouse models and PIM1 is not induced in
such models in the absence of STAT5 [34, 35]; 4. PIM
family members can function as hematopoietic oncogenes
[40–43, 49]; and 5. PIM1 regulates hematopoietic stem
cell growth [48].
Treatment of MPN cell lines with the PIM inhibitor
AZD1208 was rather ineffective at blocking cell growth,
with IC50 values of around 10 μM (Fig. 1). This is in
contrast to numerous AML cell lines that are sensitive to
AZD1208 treatment, suggesting the ability of AZD1208 to
inhibit malignant myeloid cell growth may be dependent
on factors such as the cellular driving mutation [52].
On the contrary, AZD1208 was much more effective at
inhibiting erythropoietin independent erythroid colony
formation of primary cells from MPN patients (Fig. 4). In
this assay, 0.1 - 0.2 μM consistently inhibited about 50% of
colony formation, whereas colonies from healthy controls

multiple myeloma the mechanism of action is by blocking
translation and inducing autophagy [55, 56]. However,
SGI-1776 is not specific for PIMs as it also inhibits c-Kit
and TrkA [56]. AZD1208 is a much more specific PIM
inhibitor and in AML it was determined that AZD1208
primarily blocks phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP1
resulting in inhibition of translation  [52]. It should be
noted that in order to demonstrate an augmented or
synergistic effect of combining PIM and JAK2 inhibition
to enhance the efficacy of targeting MPN cells, the dose
of ruxolitinib we utilized in our studies was suboptimal
for the effect under investigation (e.g.  decrease in
phosphorylation of biomarkers, apoptosis induction,
etc.). Thus, while JAK2 inhibition in MPN cells can
inhibit PIM expression (Supplementary Fig. 4B), low
drug concentrations do not eliminate all PIM protein,
which would remain active (Supplementary Fig. 2A),
as would be the case for incomplete target inhibition of
JAK2 inhibitors. With this said, it should be noted that
PIM3 expression is refractory to high dose ruxolitinib
treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4B). The decrease in
phosphorylation of p70S6K, S6, and 4EBP1 was only
consistently observed with AZD1208 in combination with
ruxolitinib (Fig. 5). Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 prevents
it from binding and inhibiting the translation initiation
factor eIF4E [61]. Thus AZD1208 was shown to decrease
cap-dependent translation in AML cells, an observation
made with inhibiting PIMs in other cell types [62, 63].
Our similar observation of a decrease in phosphorylation
of 4EBP1 as well as p70S6K and ribosomal protein S6,
suggests AZD1208 may be inhibiting cap-dependent
translation in JAK2-V617F-driven cells. Because the
loss of phosphorylation of these regulators of translation
is most prominent in cells treated with ruxolitinib and
AZD1208 in combination, it is possible the combinatorial
effects of these drugs may be due in part to inhibition of
this mTOR regulated pathway. Again, this is supported by
the synergy observed with JAK2 and mTOR inhibitors in
MPN cells and the observations made by Huang et al. [54].
Thus, as cancer cells have been shown to be more addicted
to protein translation than normal cells [64], eIF4E may be
a potential therapeutic target for MPNs, a concept strongly
supported by the recent determination that decreasing
cellular eIF4E levels can inhibit cellular transformation
in vivo without affecting normal development [65].
In addition to the observation, of ours and Huang
et al. [54], that downstream components of the mTOR
pathway in MPN cells are inhibited by PIM inhibitors, we
also observed a decrease in phosphorylation of BAD at
Ser-112, a known phosphorylation target of PIM. Since
this phosphorylation inhibits the pro-apoptotic activity
of BAD, decreased BAD phosphorylation would lead
to activation of BAD and subsequent apoptosis [42, 44,
45, 47]. The decrease in BAD Ser-112 phosphorylation
(Fig. 3C), along with the enhanced apoptosis (Fig. 3B)
and lack of effect on cell cycle (not shown), are consistent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with recent work that demonstrated that phosphorylation
of BAD plays a key role downstream of JAK2 in MPN
cell viability [66]. Thus, it is likely the decreased BAD
phosphorylation in response to AZD1208/ruxolitinib
combination therapy contributes to the enhancement of
apoptosis induced by the same concentration of ruxolitinib
alone (Fig. 3B). BAD phosphorylation at Ser-112 is also
regulated by activated Akt and ERK, likely explaining
the variable decrease in phosphorylated BAD by PIM
inhibition alone (at the doses analyzed) (Fig. 3C). This
is consistent with the concept proposed for the roles of
different JAK2 effector pathways in the inactivation
of BAD in MPN cells [66]. Unfortunately we have not
been successful at knocking down PIM proteins by RNA
interference approaches in our MPN cell lines to further
test some of our results, but previous work demonstrated
a small effect on the short term growth of HEL cells upon
transient knockdown of PIM1 and PIM2 [67], and more
recent work showed that targeting PIMs may sensitize
MPN cells to JAK2 inhibitors through down regulation
of c-Myc [54]. Taken together, these data suggest that
PIMs play a role in JAK2-V617F-mediated neoplastic
cell growth and may be a potential site for therapeutic
targeting to enhance the efficacy of ruxolitinib.
The persistent growth of JAK2-driven cells in drug
treated patients may be due to incomplete target inhibition
by JAK2 inhibitors. While JAK2 mutations can render
resistance to kinase inhibitors, such mutations have
never been found in patients treated with JAK2 inhibitors
[60, 68]. JAK2 heterodimerization with JAK1 and
Tyk2 may provide a mechanism of persistent growth
in the presence of JAK2 inhibitors, possibly through
transactivation of the complexed JAK family members
[60]. However, how JAK2 remains active in such
complexes in the presence of the inhibitor, which also
inhibits JAK1 in the case of ruxolitinib, is not known.
JAK2 is still required for this persistent state of resistance
suggesting such interactions with other JAK family
members may preclude the ability of current inhibitors
from accessing the ATP-binding site of JAK2, or that
JAK2 is functioning as a scaffold with its kinase activity
being compensated for by other complexed kinases.
Additional mechanisms of resistance that have been
proposed involve the activation of Ras effector pathways
by mutated Ras or GNB1 [66, 69]. These include the ERK
and AKT pathways, both of which are also effectors of
activated JAK2. Thus, JAK2 inhibitor resistance may be
maintained by alternative mechanisms of activation of
downstream effectors.
JAK2-dependent MPN cells that are developed
to be resistant to a JAK2 inhibitor are cross-resistant to
other JAK2 inhibitors [60], suggesting MPN patients
may be resilient to alternative JAK2 inhibitors following
initial resistance. While this will likely be true for many
patients, current clinical data does suggest alternative
JAK2 inhibitors may improve symptoms in some patients
40152

that are resistant to ruxolitinib [70, 71]. In addition, more
recently described type II inhibitors may be effective in
such patients (see below). Nonetheless, combination
therapies designed to target a key effector downstream of
JAK2 may be more effective because not only might such
therapies target JAK2 and augment the efficacy of JAK2
inhibitors, but such approaches may also render cells
less susceptible to drug resistance because of continuous
inhibition of JAK2 effector pathways. We demonstrate that
ruxolitinib-persistent (resistant) JAK2-V617F-dependent
cells are resensitized to the drug upon treatment with a
PIM inhibitor (Fig. 6). Circumventing the control of PIM1
expression by the JAK2/STAT5 pathway by expressing
exogenous PIM1 renders MPN model cells resistant to
ruxolitinib, providing evidence that PIMs could play a
role during a JAK2 inhibitor resistant state (Fig. 7 and
Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus, combination therapies that
include targeting PIMs may increase the efficacy of antiJAK2 therapy. The JAK2 inhibitors studied to date are
type I inhibitors which bind to the kinase when it is in
an activated state. Recently investigated type II inhibitors,
which bind to kinases in their inactive state, may offer
more effective JAK2 inhibition and greater therapeutic
efficacy [72, 73]. While type II JAK2 inhibitors may
possibly be more effective alone, future combination
therapies with such inhibitors may offer a potent antiMPN therapeutic approach.
In summary, our work utilizing MPN model cells
and primary cells from MPN patients demonstrates
that targeting PIM kinases may enhance the efficacy of
JAK2 inhibitor therapy in MPNs. This may be through
enhancing apoptosis of both JAK2 inhibitor sensitive and
resistant cells. Clinical testing of PIM inhibitors and JAK2
inhibitors in myelofibrosis was initiated in 2015 (http://
ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02370706).
