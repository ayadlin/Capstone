BACKGROUND: Several aromatase inhibitor studies have reported variations in the inhibitory potency of these agents
that could lead to differences in clinical outcomes. In the current study, the authors formally evaluated the activity of
anastrozole and exemestane in postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive, advanced breast cancer. METHODS: Postmenopausal women who had measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors and had not received previous endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive
either oral exemestane 25 mg daily or oral anastrozole 1 mg daily until they had disease progression. The primary
endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints included the clinical benefit rate (CBR),
time to progression (TTP), overall survival, and safety. Crossover to the other aromatase inhibitor was permitted at
the time of disease progression; ORR, CBR, and TTP after second-line treatment also were explored. RESULTS: In
total, 103 patients were enrolled. The median patient age was 71.6 years, 52.4% of patients had visceral disease, and
75.8% of patients had 2 disease sites. Half of the patients had received previous tamoxifen, and 60% had received previous chemotherapy. The efficacy observed in the exemestane and anastrozole groups was an ORR of 36.2% and 46%,
respectively; a CBR of 59.6% and 68%, respectively, and a TTP of 6.1 months and 12.1 months, respectively. At progression,
28 patients crossed over to the other aromatase inhibitor, including 16 patients who switched to exemestane (CBR,
43.7%; TTP, 4.4 months) and 12 patients who switched to anastrozole (CBR, 8.3%; TTP, 2 months). Both drugs were generally well tolerated, and no study drug-related serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 2
randomized trial, no significant differences in clinical activity were observed in favor of exemestane to justify a superiC 2011 American Cancer Society.

manipulation have contributed definitively to this gain.
The third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) after tamoxifen are being discussed as the mainstay of endocrine
therapy for postmenopausal patients with advanced breast
cancer.3 More recently, the 3 agents anastrozole, letrozole,
and exemestane also have improved disease-free survival
in patients with early stage disease.4
The steroidal AI exemestane differs from the nonsteroidal letrozole and anastrozole by irreversibly inactivating the aromatase. The magnitude of estrogen
suppression induced by exemestane is similar to that
induced by letrozole and slightly higher than that induced
by anastrozole.5 It is noteworthy that both exemestane
and 17-hydroexemestane, its principal metabolite, exert a
positive androgenic effect that is distinct from the effect of
the other AIs and has potential significance.6 Finally,
exemestane has demonstrated consistent activity in
patients who were pretreated with the nonsteroidal AIs
letrozole and anastrozole.7 All together, these data support
a possible advantage for exemestane as front-line antiaromatase therapy. To our knowledge, there are no randomized studies confronting 2 different classes of AIs as frontline endocrine therapy or as sequential therapy for patients
with advanced breast cancer.
We designed an exploratory open-label randomized
phase 2 study (Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group
[GEICAM] 2001/2003) to investigate the activity and
tolerability of exemestane and anastrozole as first-line hormone therapy and to explore the optimal AI sequence in
postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive,
advanced breast cancer, and cross-over was permitted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Postmenopausal women aged 18 years who had histologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were eligible if they were positive for estrogen receptor
(ER) or progesterone receptor (PgR) (either >10 fmol/mg
by biochemical assay or 10% positive cells by immunohistochemistry) had and adequate bone marrow reserve and
measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).8 Previous adjuvant tamoxifen was permitted if it was initiated at least 24 months
before recurrence. Previous neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was permitted if it had been completed 12 months
before the diagnosis of recurrent disease. A single line of
chemotherapy for metastatic disease with or without trastuzumab was allowed if it had been completed at least 4 weeks

242

before the beginning of the study drug and if the patient had
radiologically documented disease progression. Patients
were excluded from the study if they had received previous
hormone therapy for metastatic breast cancer or an AI in the
adjuvant setting, if they had rapid progressive disease or
known central nervous system metastases, if they had inadequate liver or renal function, or if they had had received any
investigational agent within 4 weeks of study enrollment.
This study was conducted in accordance with the
ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the
guidelines for good clinical practice. The protocol was
approved by all relevant ethics review boards and by the
Spanish Ministry of Health, and all patients provided
written informed consent before study enrollment.
Study Design and Treatment
This was a randomized, open-label cross-over, phase 2
study in which patients received exemestane 25 mg or
anastrozole 1 mg orally once daily until the developed disease progression. No other targeted therapies were administered. Randomization was performed and stratified
using the Pocock and Simon algorithm9 for 3 prognostic
factors: locally advanced or metastatic disease, previous
adjuvant tamoxifen therapy (yes or no), and previous
chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes or no).
The primary endpoint was the objective response rate
(ORR). Secondary endpoints included the clinical benefit
rate (CBR), time to progression (TTP), overall survival, and
toxicity. At the investigators’ discretion and upon disease
progression, patients were allowed to cross over and receive
the other AI until further disease progression; the ORR,
CBR, and TTP with second-line treatment were secondary
exploratory objectives.
In the event of any study drug-related, grade 3 toxicity according to National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) (version 2.0),10 dosing was
omitted for a maximum of 2 weeks. Upon resolution of
the toxicity, treatment was reinitiated. Patients who had
any study drug-related grade 4 toxicity discontinued participation in the study.
Study Assessments
At baseline, all patients had a disease assessment by physical examination and an appropriate radiologic test. In
addition, Eastern Cooperative Oncology performance status, hematology, blood chemistry, and coagulation profiles were obtained before randomization. All assessments
were repeated every 3 months until patients developed disease progression. The same assessment method that was

used to determine disease status at baseline was used consistently for efficacy evaluation throughout the study.
Patients who were positive for ER and/or PgR, had
measurable disease, had baseline tumor measurements,
had at least 1 tumor assessment, and had received at least
4 weeks of treatment were eligible for the response analyses. Tumor response (complete response [CR] plus partial
response [PR]) was assessed according to RECIST.9 Tumor response had to be confirmed at least 4 weeks after a
documented response. The CBR was defined as a response
plus stable disease that lasted 6 months. TTP was measured from the time of randomization until the time of
documented progressive disease, including death from
any cause. Survival was measured from the time from randomization until death from any cause.
Patients who received at least 1 dose of exemestane
or anastrozole were evaluable for safety. Adverse events
were assessed using the NCI-CTC grading system10 and
was recorded at each patient visit.

Statistical Considerations
A randomized, phase 2 design was chosen not to enable
comparison of the efficacy of the 2 drugs but to explore
whether the exemestane activity and safety precluded a
comparison with anastrozole in a formal, randomized,
phase 3 trial to demonstrate the superiority of exemestane
over anastrozole.
A Simon 2-stage design method was used to calculate
the sample size in the exemestane arm with the null hypothesis of an objective response rate (ORR) equal to 10% against
the alternative hypothesis that the ORR is not equal to 25%.
Twenty-one patients were accrued in the first stage, and, if
2 or more patients had a response, then 29 additional patients
were enrolled in the second stage, resulting in a sample size of
50 patients. No minimum response criteria were proposed for
anastrozole, because it was considered the gold standard.
ORR and CBR were calculated with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the TTP was analyzed using
the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% CIs. For hypothesis
generation, the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests
were used for exploratory analyses comparing the TTP
between treatment arms in both the first-line setting and
in patients who crossed to the other agent.

patients to receive anastrozole) in 13 Spanish centers. Six
patients (4 in the exemestane arm and 2 in the anastrozole
arm) were not evaluable for response, including 1 patient
who lacked evidence of metastatic disease, 2 patients who
had negative or unknown ER and PgR status, and 3 other
patients who lacked evidence of measurable disease.
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics for
the 103 patients. All patient characteristics were well balanced between the 2 arms. The median patient age was
71.6 years. Half of the patients had visceral metastasis,
and the majority had at least 2 involved sites of disease.
Half of the patients had received previous tamoxifen, and
almost 66% had been exposed previously to chemotherapy for early or advanced breast cancer.
Efficacy
Seventeen patients in the exemestane arm achieved a
response (36.2%; 95% CI, 18.5%-45.9%), including 3
CRs (6.4%). In the anastrozole arm, there were 23
responses (46%; 95% CI, 32.2%-59.8%), including 7
CRs (14%). The CBRs were 59.6% and 68% in the
exemestane and anastrozole arms, respectively. Table 2

Efficacy at Cross-Over
Of 88 patients who progressed on first-line endocrine therapy, 28 patients (31.8%) switched to the other AI within 1
month. Among the 12 patients who crossed from exemestane to anastrozole, only 1 achieved tumor stabilization
(which lasted 6.2 months), and no objective responses were
observed. All of the other 11 patients progressed within 5
months. Sixteen patients switched from anastrozole to
exemestane. One patient obtained a partial remission in
lung and soft tissue. In addition, 7 patients had stable disease that lasted >6 months for a total CBR of 43.7%.
The median TTP for anastrozole and exemestane as
second-line therapy (see Fig. 2) was 2.0 months (95% CI,
1.17-2.84 months) and 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.34-6.47
months), respectively. An exploratory analysis indicated
an HR of 4.01 (95% CI, 1.64-9.81; log-rank P ¼ .002).

Safety
Both compounds were well tolerated with generally mild
adverse events in the 2 arms (see Table 3). None of the
reported grade 4 adverse events were considered related to
study drug.
Serious adverse events were reported in 35% of
patients and were distributed equally between both arms.
Two of those events were considered related to study drug
(hypertension and arthralgia, both in patients who were
receiving exemestane). Dyspnea, which was the most
common serious adverse event, occurred in 8 patients, all
of whom had lung or pleural involvement from their
breast cancer at baseline, and those events were considered
disease-related. There were no treatment discontinuations
or deaths related to study drug.

DISCUSSION
This randomized, open-label, phase 2 trial was designed
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of exemestane in
patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
and to make a ‘‘go/no-go’’ decision for a formal phase 3
comparison of this drug versus anastrozole, thus comparing 2 mechanistically different AIs. Both the ORR, which
was primary objective of the study (36.2% and 46% for
exemestane and anastrozole, respectively), and the CBR
(59.6% and 68%, respectively) were lower numerically in
the exemestane group. The median time to progression
also was worse numerically for the exemestane group (6.1
months and 12.1 months, respectively), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (HR, 1.13;
95% CI, 0.75-1.72; P ¼ .558) in an exploratory analysis.
The observed results prompted us to discard the planned
phase 3 trial.
Other investigators have studied third-generation
AIs in patients with advanced breast cancer. The 2 nonCancer

January 1, 2012

steroidal AIs letrozole and anastrozole were compared in a
large phase 3 study by Rose et al.11 In that study, a total of
713 postmenopausal patients with metastatic disease who
progressed to tamoxifen were randomized. No significant
differences were observed in the primary objective, TTP
(24.7 weeks for letrozole vs 24.6 weeks for anastrozole), or
in any other efficacy measurement, excluding a modestly
increased response rate in favor of letrozole (19.1% vs
12.3%). Campos et al12 randomized 130 postmenopausal
patients with visceral (liver and/or lung), measurable,
metastatic breast cancer to a second-line endocrine therapy with exemestane or anastrozole. Again, neither the
response rate (11% vs 20%) nor the CBR (38% vs 46%)
differed statistically, but both were numerically higher in
favor of anastrozole. Ongoing trials in early stage breast
cancer are exploring the clinical implications related to
the differences in potency with the different AIs.13 The
first analysis from the MA.27 trial at a median follow-up
of 4 years indicates that there are no differences between
exemestane and anastrozole as adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early
breast cancer.14 However, the results observed in metastatic disease do not justify further studies in this setting.
In the current study, both exemestane and anastrozole were well tolerated, as expected. There were no study
drug-related deaths. Hot flashes, nausea, arthralgia, and
weight gain were among the most commonly reported
events related to study drug. Serious adverse events, irrespective of causality, were infrequent; and only 2 serious
adverse events were related to exemestane or anastrozole.
At the time of this analysis, 88 patients had progressed to first-line endocrine therapy, and 28 patients
(31.8%) had switched to the other AI as stipulated in the
study protocol. Among the 16 patients who switched to
exemestane, 7 patients (43.7%) obtained a clinical benefit
as opposed to only 1 of 12 patients who switched to anastrozole after failure on exemestane (8.3%). The median
TTP also was significantly better for exemestane as a
cross-over option to first-line progression (4.41 months vs
2.0 months; HR, 4.01; 95% CI, 1.64-9.81; P ¼ .002).
Although, at the time of this analysis, 12 patients had not
progressed to first-line therapy, the second-line results
must be considered as definitive; because, based on those
results, the investigators decided to close the cross-over
option, because better endocrine therapy options could be
offered to patients who progressed on exemestane.
The activity of exemestane after reversible aromatase
inhibition was reported first by Lonning et al,7 who demonstrated a 6.6% ORR and a 24.3% CBR in a series that

245

Original Article

included 136 patients who progressed to aminoglutethimide and 105 patients who progressed to a third-generation AI (anastrozole, letrozole, or vorozole). In general,
exemestane appeared to be more effective after aminoglutethimide than the more effective AI in terms of ORR
(8.1% and 4.8%, respectively) and CBR (27.2% and
20.4%, respectively). This partial noncross-resistance
between exemestane and the third-generation, nonsteroidal AIs (anastrozole or letrozole) has been detailed by
other investigators in small series.15,16 Recently, a large
phase 3 trial compared exemestane with fulvestrant, an
ER down-regulator (Faslodex; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, Del), as second-line endocrine therapy
for patients who progressed on anastrozole or letrozole.17
The median TTP for both agents was equivalent (3.7
months in both arms; P ¼ .65) as was the ORR (6.7% vs
7.4% for exemestane and fulvestrant, respectively; P ¼
.74) and the CBR (32% for both arms).
Conversely, only 1 previous study analyzed the activity of the nonsteroidal inhibitors after exemestane. Bertelli et al18 reported a 56% CBR and a median TTP of 9.3
months with the nonsteroidal AIs among 18 patients who
previously had progressed to exemestane. Although these
results may appear contradictory to ours, it must be noted
that 17 patients in that study received letrozole, and only
1 patient received anastrozole as salvage therapy.
It is noteworthy that the current study is the first to
report numerical differences in activity between 2 of the
third-generation AIs; although, in an exploratory analysis,
exemestane appeared to be more effective than anastrozole
patients progressed to the other agent. Is this difference in
activity supported by their mechanistically different aromatase blockage, or could it be the result of differences in estrogen suppression potency? Enhanced sensitivity to residual
estrogen levels has been suggested as a mechanism of breast
cancer progression to AIs.19-21 Compared with anastrozole,
exemestane is a more potent estrogen suppressor agent, and
a greater reduction in estrogen levels could reverse this
adaptive hypersensitivity mechanism. In addition, the mild
androgenic activity of exemestane may induce a second antitumor effect. A better understanding of these mechanisms
will be of great help in the design of new therapeutic strategies in both the adjuvant and advanced setting. Some of
these hypotheses are being explored in several early stage
breast cancer studies, because they support the rationale for
sequential AI strategies (the MA.27 trial) and intermittent
AI strategies (the Study of Letrozole Extension trial).
In conclusion, in this phase 2 randomized trial,
we did not observe any difference in clinical activity in

246

favor of exemestane to justify a superiority phase 3 trial
design in the first-line setting. Although it was not the
primary objective of the current study, we observed a dissimilar tumor behavior based in the sequential AI
approach that we used.
