BACKGROUND. The molecular classification system categorizes invasive breast
carcinomas according to their key driving biomarkers. In the current study, the
authors evaluated whether response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was correlated
with the molecular classification groups.

METHODS. Using immunohistochemistry, the molecular classification group
(luminal-A, luminal-B, HER-2–variant, HER-2–classic, and basal phenotype) was
retrospectively determined in 68 breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant
treatment.

RESULTS. A total of 28 carcinoma patients (41.2%) achieved a compete pathologic
response (CPR), including 2 of 15 patients classified as having luminal-A (13.3%),
4 of 16 patients classified as having luminal-B (25.0%), 10 of 12 patients classified
as having HER-2–classic (83.3%), none of the 4 patients classified as having HER2–variant, and 12 of 21 patients classified as having basal phenotype (57.1%) neoplasms. The CPR rate among patients with the HER-2–classic and basal neoplasms was 67% (22 of 33 neoplasms), compared with 17.1% (6 of 35 neoplasms)
in the non-HER-2–classic/basal combined group (P < .001). Eleven carcinomas
were initially diagnosed as invasive lobular carcinomas (pleomorphic and classic), 4 of which were luminal-A, 4 of which were luminal-B, 2 of which were
HER-2–classic, and 1 of which was basal. On review, only 3 of these 11 cases
remained classified as classic lobular carcinoma, all of which were classified as
luminal-A, and none of these patients achieved a CPR. Four of the other 8
patients achieved a CPR.

CONCLUSIONS. The molecular classification system is useful for identifying carcinoma patients who are most likely and those who are least likely to achieve a
CPR. In the current study, all the morphologically classic lobular carcinomas
were classified as luminal-A neoplasms, which may explain the low rate of CPR
reported. Cancer 2007;110:1687–96.  2007 American Cancer Society.

eoadjuvant chemotherapy is frequently administered to patients
with large or locally advanced invasive breast carcinoma.1 Its
main benefit is to extend the range of patients eligible for breastconserving surgery by surgically downsizing carcinomas.2–7 This
benefit is almost exclusively restricted to the subgroup of patients
who achieve a complete pathologic response (CPR).5,8–14 In this setting, CPR is a robust prognostic marker and is used as a surrogate

clinical endpoint.15 Predictive markers of CPR such
as estrogen receptor (ER) status, HER-2, vascular
space invasion, and tumor necrosis factor have been
the focus of numerous studies over the years.16–24
The majority of these factors have functioned less
than optimally when evaluated outside the initial
study setting.
Invasive breast carcinomas are biologically
diverse. Gene profiling and genomic studies have
revealed the existence of several molecularly distinct
groups of carcinomas, each with their own unique
set of central, key molecular alterations. These molecular subgroups have distinctive clinical associations including statistically significantly different
rates of disease-free and overall survival.25–31 It is
no coincidence that the major subgroups of carcinoma identified by molecular techniques segregate
roughly into the major therapeutic taxonomic
groups. Subsequently, immunohistochemistry (IHC)
has been shown to reliably identify the major molecular subgroups of invasive breast carcinoma.32–35
What to our knowledge was the most thorough of
these studies was published by the Nottingham
Breast Study Group.36 The authors applied 26 IHC
assays to 1076 carcinomas. Using hierarchical clustering and artificial neural networks, they corroborated the gene array-based classification system and
identified the characteristic driving biomarkers of
each group.
Molecular taxonomic classification provides the
framework of a single system by which all invasive
carcinomas can be systematically grouped according
to the key molecular alterations of the individual
neoplasm. Such an approach may be beneficial with
regard to predictive stratification for a CPR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy across the entire biologic spectrum of invasive carcinomas. The goal of the current
study was to evaluate the utility of the molecular
classification system as a predictive marker of CPR
in a wide group of patients with locally advanced
breast carcinoma who were treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Approval for the study was granted by the William
Beaumont Hospital Human Investigations Committee (HIC# E2005-096). Sixty-eight patients who were
initially diagnosed between July 1, 2001 and December 30, 2005 by core needle biopsy or open biopsy
and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed
by surgical resection were retrieved from the William
Beaumont Hospital Tumor Registry. Patients included
in the study had histologically confirmed, invasive,

clinical stage II or III primary breast carcinoma.
None of the patients received prior treatment or had
a previous ipsilateral in situ or invasive breast carcinoma. Clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not included in this study. The pretreatment
diagnosis was established based on large-bore core
needle or open biopsy specimens (none were fineneedle aspiration biopsies). All pertinent dates
including birth date, date of the initial diagnosis, and
dates of definitive surgery were obtained from the
clinical record. Stage of disease was assigned using
the 6th edition of the American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) staging manual.37
The following features were recorded for each
case:
(1) Initial diagnosis (morphologic type and grade of
invasive carcinoma, as obtained from the surgical
pathology report).
(2) Review diagnosis (morphologic type and grade
of invasive carcinoma according to the World
Health Organization38). Grade was assigned
using the system of Elston and Ellis.39 Invasive
lobular carcinoma was restricted to neoplasms
with classic, dyshesive, or trabecular infiltration
patterns by uniform, pure nuclear grade 1, small
round cells that resembled mast cells.40–42
Carcinomas with a predominantly lobular-type
infiltration pattern and focal (>1%) ductal differentiation were classified as ductal-not otherwise
specified (NOS). Neoplasms with a dyshesive
growth pattern by cells with greater degrees of
cellular atypia and pleomorphism (so-called
grade 2 or pleomorphic lobular carcinomas) also
were classified as ductal-NOS neoplasms.43,44
(3) Angiolymphatic invasion and tumor necrosis.45
(4) Type of definitive surgical specimen (mastectomy
vs lumpectomy) and total number of breast specimen blocks submitted.
(5) CPR or total therapy effect, which was defined as
the absence of invasive carcinoma cells and the
presence of fibrous stroma, clusters of foamy
macrophages, and calcifications.
(6) Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Agents and
delivery schedule were selected at the discretion
of the treating oncologist based on patient and
relevant pathologic factors including ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER-2 assay results. All
HER-2-positive (as detected by IHC and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH]) patients
received trastuzumab. Agents and delivery schedule were at the discretion of the treating oncologist and reflected the standard of care at the time
of diagnosis (Table 1). Regimens were combined

into 3 groups for statistical analysis: the anthracycline and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) group; the anthracycline and taxane group; and the anthracycline,
taxane, and trastuzumab group.
(7) ER, PR, and HER-2 status. For ER and PR, positive results were set at a 6 fmol/mg cytosolic

methods and an Allred et al. score of 3 using
serial dilutions (Table 1).46 Immunoreactivity
was quantified with image analysis (Cass 200

were assessed immunohistochemically using
the Herceptest kitTM (Dako Corporation, Carpenteria, Calif ). The Pathvysion kitTM (Vysis Inc,
Downers Grove, Ill) FISH assay was used to
assess HER-2 gene amplification. Fluorescent
signals were evaluated and scored on an Ariol
image analyzer (Applied Imaging, San Jose,
Calif ). At least 20 computer tiles were scored in
each case.

Molecular Classification
IHC was retrospectively applied to pretreatment biopsy specimens to classify each carcinoma molecularly using the panel of antibodies and the system of
the Nottingham Breast Study Group.36 Antibody
clones and optimization parameters for our laboratory are listed in Table 2. Sections measuring 4-lm
thick were cut and dried for 1 hour. Deparaffinization
was achieved using a series of graded alcohols and
xylene baths. Antigen retrieval was applied using a
pressure cooker (Biocare, Redwood City, Calif) for 4
minutes at 1128C. A Dako autostainer instrument
was used to apply the primary antibodies for 30 minutes and all washes. A 1-step polymer detection system (Envision Kit; Dako Corporation) was applied
with diaminobenzene chromogen. Slides were counterstained in Meyer hematoxylin. Carcinomas were
classified into 1 of 5 molecular groups based on the
key driving molecular events or proteins in invasive
breast carcinomas as described by the Nottingham

Group classification was based on the combined presence and absence of characteristic key proteins or
gene alterations (Table 3). Low-level hormone or
HER-2 receptor expression or low-level HER-2 gene
amplification (in the absence of strong protein
expression) did not exclude a carcinoma from a specific molecular group.
Statistical analysis was performed using the
Systat 11TM software program (Systat Software Inc.,
San Jose, Calif.) and included the Pearson chi-square
test, Fisher exact test (with Yates correction), and
logistical regression analysis.

RESULTS

diagnosed with stage II disease and 42 patients
(61.8%) were diagnosed with stage III disease (Table
3) (P 5 .052) (Table 4). Sixty-three carcinomas (92.7%)
were diagnosed on review as ductal carcinoma, 3 as
lobular carcinoma (4.4%), and 2 as mucinous carcinoma (2.9%). Mucinous carcinomas were grouped
with ductal carcinomas for the purposes of statistical
analyses. Seven carcinomas were grade 1 (10.2%), 16
were grade 2 (23.5%), and 45 (66.2%) were grade 3.
The percentage of grade 3 carcinomas was significantly greater than that for grade 1 and grade 2 neoplasms (P < .001).

Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Eight patients (11.8%) received a regimen containing
anthracycline and 5-FU; 39 patients (57.3%) received
a regimen that contained anthracycline and taxane;
and 21 patients (30.9%) received a regimen containing anthracycline, taxane, and trastuzumab. The
mean and median intervals between the time of the
initial diagnosis and definitive surgery were 24.7
weeks and 23.1 weeks, respectively (range, 16.1–40.9
weeks; SD, 5.9 weeks).

Definitive Resection Specimens
Nineteen patients (27.9%) underwent partial mastectomy and 49 patients (72.1%) underwent mastectomy.
The mean and median numbers of breast resection
specimen tissue blocks submitted per patient were 40
and 36, respectively (range, 21–83 resection specimen
blocks; SD, 13 resection specimen blocks).

Receptor and Molecular Groups
Thirty-one carcinomas (45.6%) were molecularly classified as luminal-A or luminal-B neoplasms (15 as luminal-A [22.1%] and 16 as luminal-B [23.5%]). Twenty
carcinomas (29.4%) were found to be HER-2 positive
(12 HER-2–classic cases [17.7%] and 4 HER-2–variant
cases [5.9%]), and 21 carcinomas (30.9%) were classified as basal phenotype. The distribution of carcinomas
among the 3 major molecular groups (luminal-A/luminal-B, HER-2, and basal phenotype) was statistically
similar (P 5 .731). All 3 cases diagnosed as lobular carcinoma on review were luminal-A neoplasms. Vascular
space invasion was identified in 5 carcinomas (7.4%), 3
of which were luminal-B and 2 of which were basal
phenotype. Thirteen carcinomas had tumor necrosis
(19.1%), 8 of which were basal phenotype, 3 of which
were HER-2-classic, and 2 of which were luminal-B.
The mean and median hormone receptor and
HER-2 assay values for the 5 molecular groups are
listed in Table 5. Sixty-five of the 68 study group
patients (95.6%) underwent a HER-2 FISH assay. The
distribution of molecular groups according to hormone receptor and HER-2 status is listed in Table 6.
The distribution of carcinomas across the 5 hormone
receptor and HER-2 status groups was found to be

statistically similar (P 5 .053). Of the 21 basal phenotype carcinomas, 13 (62%) were ER negative, PR negative, and HER-2 negative; 5 carcinomas (23.8%) were
ER positive, PR negative, and HER-2 negative; 2 (9.5%)
were ER negative, PR negative, and HER-2 positive;
and 1 carcinoma (4.8%) was ER positive and HER-2
positive. All 4 (100%) of the HER-2 variant group carcinomas were ER positive and HER-2 positive.

CPRe
A CPR in the breast and axillary lymph nodes was
obtained in 28 of the 68 patients (41.2%). The mean
number of resection specimen tissue blocks submitted
per case in which a CPR was documented was 40.9
and the mean number in non-CPR cases was 39.5
(P 5 .66). Twenty-two of the 28 CPR carcinomas
(78.6%) were HER-2–classic (10 carcinomas) or basal
phenotype (12 carcinomas) (Table 7). Ten of the CPR
carcinomas (35.7%) were ER negative and HER-2 positive. Twenty-seven CPR carcinomas (96.4%) were
graded as grade 2 or 3 ductal carcinoma on review diagnosis, 1 was a grade 1 ductal carcinoma (3.6%), and
none were diagnosed as lobular carcinoma. The molecular classification group with the highest percentage of CPR carcinomas was the HER-2–classic group

(10 of 12 carcinomas; 83.3%), followed by the basal
phenotype group (12 of 21 carcinomas; 57.1%),
whereas the luminal-A group had the lowest rate of
CPR carcinomas (2 of 15 carcinomas; 13.3%).
Eleven neoplasms were initially diagnosed as
lobular carcinoma, 8 of which were diagnosed as
high grade (grade 2) or pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. Four of these 11 patients (36.3%) sustained a
CPR. The slides of these 11 carcinomas were carefully reviewed. Using the review diagnosis classification criteria, 3 carcinomas were diagnosed as classic
lobular carcinoma, all of which were in the luminalA molecular group, and none of which achieved a
CPR. Three carcinomas had a prominent dyshesive
invasion pattern with focal ductal differentiation and
were classified as grade 1 ductal carcinoma on
review diagnosis. Two of these 3 neoplasms were
luminal-B, 1 of which achieved a CPR. The other 5
carcinomas were classified on review diagnosis as
grade 2 or grade 3 ductal carcinoma with high grade
nuclear pleomorphism and a prominent dyshesive
invasive growth pattern. Two of these 5 carcinomas
were luminal-B, 2 were HER-2-classic, and 1 was basal phenotype. Patients with both HER-2-classic and
the basal phenotype carcinomas achieved a CPR.

Three of the 8 patients treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy regimens containing anthracycline
and 5-FU (37.5%); 12 of the 39 patients treated
with anthracyclines and taxanes (30.8%); and 13 of
the 21 patients treated with anthracycline, taxane,
and trastuzumab (61.2%) achieved a CPR. None the
3 patients with HER-2-positive (low-level amplified)
basal phenotype carcinomas who received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy with trastuzumab achieved a CPR.
Factors found to be significantly associated with
CPR on univariate analysis were HER-2-classic or
basal phenotype molecular classification (P < .001),
HER-2 positivity (P 5 .040), and ER negativity
(P 5 .002). Carcinomas graded as grade 2 or 3 ductal
carcinoma on review diagnosis (P 5 .170) and treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens
(P 5 .063) were not found to be significantly associated with achieving a CPR. Factors found to be significantly associated with a CPR on univariate analysis
were carried forward for logistical regression multivariate analysis. When ER status, HER-2 status, and molecular classification group were evaluated in a single
model against each other, only the HER-2-classic and
basal phenotype molecular groups were found to be
significantly associated with CPR (P 5 .010) (Table 8).

DISCUSSION
The molecular taxonomic classification system, initially described by Sorlie et al., separates invasive
breast carcinomas according to their central, key,
molecular alterations.25–36 Not surprisingly, these
molecular groups segregate roughly into the main
neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens given to contemporary breast carcinoma patients. We retrospectively applied this molecular classification system to
a broad group of breast carcinoma patients who
were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy to evaluate its predictive utility with regard to obtaining a
CPR and found that it was useful from 2 perspectives. It identified the subset of carcinoma patients
most likely to achieve a CPR from neoadjuvant therapy (those with HER-2–classic; 83.3%) and conversely, it also identified the group of carcinoma
patients who were least likely to sustain a CPR (those
with luminal-A neoplasms; 13.3%).
Over the past 20 years, there has been a large
effort by authors to identify predictive markers associated with CPR. Factors including ER and PR levels,
HER-2/neu gene status, the grade and subtype of
invasive carcinoma, extensive tumor necrosis, vascular space invasion, and proliferation markers have
been linked inconsistently with CPR.16–24 Although
initially promising, many of these factors failed to
maintain significance in subsequent studies. One
reason for this poor reproducibility is that the number and array of chemotherapeutic agents and delivery schedules has increased over time.9,10,12,53,54
Many of these factors, such as ER or HER-2/neu
gene status, function as predictive markers of
response to a single therapeutic agent and lose their
predictive power when applied to neoplasms that are
outside the response boundaries of the chemotherapeutic agent. A second likely underlying issue is that
each individual factor is not sufficiently accurate to
exclude all cases in which a positive (or negative)
result is an epiphenomenon, secondary event rather
than a central key driving molecular alteration.
Similar to prior authors, we found that HER-2and
ER status were significantly associated with CPR.9,55,56
However, when these 2 factors were evaluated with
the molecular classification system on a single multivariate analysis model, only the molecular classification system remained significantly associated with
CPR. Recent studies have shown higher rates of CPR
and survival in HER-2–positive patients who received
trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, with no significant differences noted between
patients with low-level and those with high-level
gene-amplified neoplasms.9,56,57 It is important to
point out that none of these studies reported an

improved outcome or CPR in 100% of the patients
who received trastuzumab. It is possible that HER-2
positivity alone is insufficient to identify the subgroup
of patients who will benefit from trastuzumab. None
of the 7 HER-2–positive patients whose carcinomas
were HER-2–variant or basal phenotype carcinomas
and who received trastuzumab sustained a CPR.
We believe the molecular classification system is
an advancement forward over standard predictive
markers. It provides the framework by which all invasive carcinomas can be systematically grouped based
on their key molecular alterations, which offers a
clearer picture for selecting and tailoring chemotherapy components for an individual patient. In addition,
because it uses the results of a cluster of markers as
the basis on which carcinomas are classified, the
impact of epigenetic alterations of individual markers
such as ER or HER-2 are minimized. Evidence of the
impact of epigenetic genetic pressure can be observed
in the basal phenotype and HER-2–variant molecular
groups. Of the 21 basal phenotype carcinomas
reported in the current study, 6 (28.6%) were (lowlevel) ER positive and 3 (14.3%) were HER-2 positive
with low-level gene amplification. All 4 of the HER-2–
variant carcinomas were ER positive and had lowlevel amplification of HER-2. All 4 carcinoma patients
failed to achieve a CPR, 3 of whom had no evidence
of a response to chemotherapy (data not shown).
All 3 morphologically classic lobular carcinomas
were luminal-A neoplasms. Other authors have
reported that lobular carcinoma patients rarely
achieve a CPR and for this reason patients with invasive lobular carcinoma should be excluded from
receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.58–62 The results
of the current study strengthen this recommendation.
They also provide a plausible explanation for this
association. We suggest the low rate of CPR noted in
lobular carcinoma patients is driven by their luminalA status, which overall was found to have the lowest
rate of CPR (13.3%) of any molecular group. The current study also brings cautionary attention in this
regard to those neoplasms diagnosed as high grade or
so-called pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. This
recently described morphology consists of cytologically high-grade carcinoma that infiltrates in a dyshesive, lobular pattern of invasion.43,44 Of the 11
carcinomas initially diagnosed as lobular carcinoma, 8
were considered to be high grade (grade 2) or pleomorphic lobular carcinoma, 4 of which (50%)
achieved a CPR. This CPR rate stands in strong contrast to the 3 classic lobular carcinomas that were all
luminal-A type; none of the patients achieved a CPR.
Four of the 8 carcinomas initially diagnosed as a high
grade or pleomorphic lobular carcinoma were lumi-

nal-B group neoplasms, 2 were HER-2–classic, 1 was
basal phenotype, and 1 was luminal A. These results
suggest that high-grade or pleomorphic carcinomas
are a mixture of molecular groups and are not a
unique and distinctive type of carcinoma. From the
perspective of denying neoadjuvant chemotherapy
based on the morphologic type of invasive carcinoma,
we recommend abandoning the term ‘‘pleomorphic
lobular carcinoma’’ and that lobular carcinoma be restricted to pure classic lobular pattern neoplasms.
In summary, the molecular classification system
identifies subgroups of invasive carcinoma patients
who are most likely and least likely to achieve a CPR
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We believe this
approach is a step forward toward tailored, more
precise therapies for individual patients.
