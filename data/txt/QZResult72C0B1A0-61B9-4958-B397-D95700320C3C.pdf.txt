ABSTRACT
Basal-like breast cancers (BBCs) are enriched for increased EGFR expression and
decreased expression of PTEN. We found that treatment with metformin and erlotinib
synergistically induced apoptosis in a subset of BBC cell lines. The drug combination
led to enhanced reduction of EGFR, AKT, S6 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, as well as
prevented colony formation and inhibited mammosphere outgrowth. Our data with
other compounds suggested that biguanides combined with EGFR inhibitors have the
potential to outperform other targeted drug combinations and could be employed
in other breast cancer subtypes, as well as other tumor types, with activated EGFR
and PI3K signaling. Analysis of BBC cell line alterations led to the hypothesis that
loss of PTEN sensitized cells to the drug combination which was confirmed using
isogenic cell line models with and without PTEN expression. Combined metformin and
erlotinib led to partial regression of PTEN-null and EGFR-amplified xenografted MDAMB-468 BBC tumors with evidence of significant apoptosis, reduction of EGFR and AKT
signaling, and lack of altered plasma insulin levels. Combined treatment also inhibited
xenografted PTEN null HCC-70 BBC cells. Measurement of trough plasma drug levels
in xenografted mice and a separately performed pharmacokinetics modeling study
support possible clinical translation.

growth factor receptor (EGFR), loss of expression of
phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
ten (PTEN), as well as mutation of BRCA1, PIK3CA and
p53 [2–5]. More recently, it has been shown that many
BBCs harbor decreased expression of the PTPN12 tyrosine
phosphatase and inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase
type II (INPP4B), leading respectively to increased growth
factor and PI3K pathway activation [6–8]. Overall, BBCs
have the highest PI3K/AKT pathway activity among
the different breast cancer subtypes [1]. While we await

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 80% of breast cancers classified by
gene expression as basal-like are identified clinically as
triple negative [1]. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs)
are defined by a lack of estrogen receptor expression and
progesterone receptor expression, as well as an absence of
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2/HER2)
amplification. BBCs are heterogeneous, but common
molecular aberrations include overexpression of epidermal

clinical exploitation of these findings, BBCs retain a high
rate of recurrence and death [9].
EGFR, due to its oncogenic properties and its
overexpression in BBCs, provides an opportunity for
targeted therapies [10]. Recently published data from the
work of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicates that
approximately 23% of BBCs harbor EGFR gene copy
number gain [1]. Although EGFR expression correlates
with poor prognosis, clinical trials incorporating EGFR
inhibitors in TNBC have yielded only modest clinical
results [11]. This may be due to the heterogeneous nature
of BBCs in which not only the expression of EGFR is
variable but also the activity of EGFR and dependence
of the tumor on that activity. Furthermore, plausible
explanations for primary resistance to single agent EGFR
targeted therapy include continued activation of alternate
receptors tyrosine kinases [e.g. c-Met and insulin-like
growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)], signal feedback, or decoupling EGFR from downstream AKT signaling through
loss of PTEN or INPP4B [7, 12–15]. Therefore, rational
drug combinations with the goal of potentiating the effect
of EGFR inhibitors in BBCs should be explored.
Metformin, a type 2 diabetes drug, has demonstrated
antitumor effects in multiple cancer models [16–18].
Metformin has been shown to reduce EGFR, mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT signaling in
breast cancer cell lines, and selectively induced apoptosis
in TNBC cells [19, 20]. However, the clinical relevance
of these in vitro findings remains uncertain due to the
high doses of metformin required. Recently, metformin
was shown to selectively kill tumor initiating cells at
doses as low as 100 µM with corresponding potentiation
of chemotherapy efficacy in xenograft models [21]. In
addition, epidemiologic studies show that diabetic patients
taking metformin have a lower mortality rate as well as
a decreased risk of developing breast cancer [22, 23],
although these results remain debatable due to possible
methodology shortcomings [24, 25]. To clarify such
ambiguity, continued research into the potential use of
metformin as a cancer therapeutic is worthwhile.
The mechanisms of metformin’s anti-neoplastic
properties are controversial. Metformin can reduce
circulating glucose and insulin levels by inhibiting
gluconeogenesis in the liver. This is accomplished
through metformin’s ability to indirectly activate
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by inhibiting
oxidative phosphorylation in cells [26]. In cancer cells,
this inhibition leads to reduced ATP production and
cellular energy crisis[27]. Among its many substrates,
activated AMPK inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin
complex-1 (mTORC1) output and lipogenesis by
phosphorylating tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) and
acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC), respectively [28, 29]. In
addition, metformin has recently been shown to directly
inhibit mTORC1 activity in a RAG GTPase dependent
manner and indirectly through the p53-REDD1 axis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[30, 31]. Metformin has been shown to inhibit tumors in
mice both by decreasing circulating growth factors and
by directly inhibiting tumor cell growth and survival
pathways. In one study, metformin delayed the outgrowth
of tumors in PTEN heterozygous mice without altering the
plasma insulin or IGF-1 levels [32]. In contrast, metformin
prevented tumor formation in a toxin-mediated mouse
model of lung cancer while reducing circulating IGF-1 and
insulin levels, but without demonstrated ability to activate
AMPK in lung tissue [18]. Although these data have not
led to a unified mechanism of how metformin could inhibit
or prevent human cancers, epidemiologic and preclinical
evidence has inspired ongoing clinical trials.
Metformin’s ability to activate AMPK, as well as
deactivate EGFR, AKT and mTORC1 provides a rationale
for assessing whether metformin can synergize with EGFR
inhibition to treat BBCs. In this study, we demonstrated
that erlotinib (an EGFR kinase inhibitor) and metformin
synergistically inhibited the growth and induced cell death
in a subset of BBC cell lines with accompanying enhanced
reduction of EGFR, AKT and mTORC1 signaling. We
showed in an isogenic MCF10A cell model that loss
of PTEN sensitized cells to the drug combination and
conversely, introducing PTEN into PTEN-null tumor
cell lines desensitized cells to the drug combination.
This synergy was confirmed in vivo by demonstrating
significant reduction in tumor burden after combined drug
treatment as compared to treatment with either drug alone.

RESULTS
A subset of BBC lines is sensitive to combined
treatment with metformin and erlotinib
To investigate the cell signaling status of various
direct and indirect targets of erlotinib and metformin in
BBCs, we examined the phosphorylation levels of EGFR,
AMPK, AKT, S6 and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) in
a panel of breast cancer cell lines. In general, there is
increased phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, S6 and 4EBP1
in breast cancer cell lines compared with immortalized
non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells
(HMEC-hTERT), as well as a significant decrease in
AMPK phosphorylation at Thr172 (Fig. 1A). Although
the luminal breast cancer lines MCF7 and T47D expressed
very low levels of total EGFR, they exhibited significant
EGFR phosphorylation. The consistent activation of
EGFR and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway
across various BBC lines, as well as a decrease in AMPK
signal, provided a strong rationale for testing combined
treatment with erlotinib and metformin.
To investigate whether combined metformin and
erlotinib treatment is effective in BBCs, a panel of 17 breast
cancer cell lines (16 BBC lines and one luminal line) was
screened for synergy over a range of metformin (0.5 to
4 mM) and erlotinib (2 to 4 µM) doses. We found that the

drug combination is synergistic in 8 of the lines (47.1%),
additive in 4 (23.5%) and antagonistic in 5 others (29.4%)
(Table 1). To test that the observed synergy was not due to
off target effects of erlotinib, we repeated the experiment
using BIBW-2992 (a dual EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase
inhibitor) and metformin in HER2-negative MDA-MB-468
cells and obtained similar results (Suppl. Table 1). These
results demonstrate that inhibition of EGFR combined
with the effects of metformin can synergistically inhibit
the growth of a subset of BBC cell lines.
To probe what may contribute to the combined
drug synergy, we assessed the expression of OCT1,
OCT2, liver kinase beta 1 (LKB1) and PTEN in the BBC

lines. The OCTs are cation transporters of metformin
and their expression varies in different tissues [33–36].
We found that the majority of cell lines, including
HMEC-hTERT, expressed significant amounts of both
OCT1 and OCT2, indicating that differential sensitivity
to the drug combination was not due to limitations in
metformin transport (Fig. 1B). BT-549, with almost no
expression of either OCT protein, is one of the lines
in the “additive group” which is consistent with the
existence of known additional metformin transporters
(e.g. OCT3) [33]. In addition, analysis of RNA-seq
results of the TCGA BBC data with z-score threshold of
±1 using the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal [37] showed

expression of these OCT proteins, including OCT3
[[1]; data not shown]. This suggests that metformin
can effectively enter breast cancer cells. While we
found reduced LKB1 expression (upstream of AMPK)
in multiple cell lines, only SUM-149 cells completely
lacked LKB1 expression. We also noted that all the
lines with known PTEN mutations fall into either the
synergistic or additive category with the exception of
the HCC-38 cell line, which upon review of the Sanger
database contains an interchromosomal breakpoint
within PTEN (Table 1), and confirmed that all the PTEN
mutant lines lack PTEN expression (Fig.  1B). Therefore
PTEN mutation was noted as a possible determinant of
sensitivity to combined treatment.

MDA-MB-468 cells, highly sensitive to the drug
combination, have known mutational abrogation of
PTEN and p53, as well as amplification of EGFR. MDAMB-468 cells therefore serve as a good model for TNBC
with highly active EGFR signaling. MDA-MB-468 cells
showed dose-dependent response (reduction of EGFR
signaling) to erlotinib ranging from 2.5 to 40 µM but doses
required to significantly inhibit EGFR phosphorylation
are higher than what is achievable in patients treated
with approved doses and schedules (Fig. 2A). According
to the erlotinib product information (Roche), the median
minimum and maximum steady state plasma levels of

erlotinib, in patients treated at a dose of 150 mg daily,
are 2.7 µM and 4.6 µM respectively. The incomplete
blockade of EGFR signaling by erlotinib in vitro at
doses corresponding to median clinically achievable
plasma levels highlights a need to identify a synergistic
combination. We then investigated the effect of metformin
on MDA-MB-468 cells and compared metformin’s effects
with those of another AMPK agonist, 5-aminoimidazole4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR). As expected, there
was a dose-dependent phosphorylation of AMPK and
ACC, a downstream substrate of AMPK, when treated
with metformin or AICAR (Fig. 2B). However, there
was a strong dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the
phosphorylation of S6 using metformin that was not
observed when cells were treated with AICAR, indicating
this inhibitory effect on S6 in MDA-MB-468 cells was
AMPK independent (Fig. 2B).
To test whether metformin and erlotinib could
cooperate in sustained inhibition of relevant signaling
pathways, we analyzed cell signaling changes 24 hours
after various drug treatments (metformin, erlotinib,
AICAR and rapamycin) in MDA-MB-468 cells. We
included AICAR and rapamycin since metformin has
been shown to directly or indirectly act on their targets.
We observed potentiation of erlotinib-induced inhibition
of EGFR, ERK1/2 and AKT signaling with the addition
of metformin which was not observed in the other tested
drug combinations: erlotinib and rapamycin, erlotinib and
AICAR, or metformin and rapamycin (Fig. 2C). Although
rapamycin is effective at inhibiting the mTORC1 S6
output, it is a poor inhibitor of 4EBP1 phosphorylation
(Fig. 2C). Metformin, on the other hand, decreased
phosphorylation of both S6 and 4EBP1 when used alone,
and both outputs were further inhibited when metformin
was combined with erlotinib. AICAR treatment lacked
these effects, again indicating that the enhanced inhibition
on cell signaling with metformin observed is not solely
AMPK-dependent (Fig. 2C). We confirmed the same
potentiation of inhibitory effects on AKT, S6 and 4EBP1
signaling in another BBC cell line, BT-20, which also has
a strong basal EGFR signal output (Fig. 2D). We used
an RTK antibody array to simultaneously assess whether
other signaling pathways are changed by combination
treatment, and found the levels of phosphorylated RTKs
such as HER2, HER3, IGF-IR, and InsR were generally
weak in MDA-MB-468 cells, and no significant changes
were found (Suppl. Fig. 1A).

only partially inhibited proliferation and was unable to
induce apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis showed
significant increased expression of cleaved-caspase 3 for
cells under combination treatment as compared with single
agent treatments (Suppl. Fig. 1B). We also performed a
cytotoxic clonogenic assay in MDA-MB-468 cells and
observed that the combination treatment of metformin
and erlotinib significantly reduced, and almost eliminated,
colony formation as compared with single agent treatments
(Fig. 3B). We included rapamycin for comparison and
observed that the metformin and erlotinib combination
was superior to the rapamycin and erlotinib combination
at a dosage that resulted in similar S6 inhibition. We also
compared the effect of metformin and erlotinib versus
their combinations with other inhibitors of relevant
pathways revealed in our signaling experiment in MDAMB-468 cells. These combinations include combining
metformin with MK2206 (an allosteric AKT inhibitor),
metformin with GSK1120212 (an allosteric MEK1 and
MEK2 inhibitor), and erlotinib with AZD8055 (an ATPcompetitive mTOR kinase inhibitor). We found that when
these drugs were all used at their IC40 concentrations,
the combination of metformin with erlotinib was superior
to all other combinations tested as measured by growth
inhibition over 6 days in MDA-MB-468 cells (Suppl.
Fig. 2).
To investigate the effect of the drug combination
on an enriched cancer stem cell population that forms
mammospheres in non-attaching and serum-free culture
conditions, we performed mammosphere formation
assays in the presence of different drug treatments.
We observed complete inhibition of mammosphere
formation in MDA-MB-468 cells treated with both drugs
while treatment with metformin or erlotinib as single
agents only partially inhibited mammosphere formation
(Fig. 3C). The ability of the combination to inhibit
mammosphere outgrowth was confirmed in other BBC
cell lines and suggested a more indiscriminant effect
since the inhibition was seen in lines that showed only
additive, or even antagonistic effects in our cell viability
assays (Suppl. Fig. 3A-B).
To further confirm the ability of the drug combination
of metformin and erlotinib to induce apoptosis, we tested
the eight cell lines that were synergistically inhibited by the
drug combination in the cell viability assay (Table 1) using
flow cytometry to assay for cell death. Six of the eight cell
lines (MDA-MB-468, HCC-1937, L56BrC1, HCC70,
MCF7 and BT-20) exhibited significant cell death, ranging
from 13.6 % to 55.4%, under the combination treatment as
compared with no increase in cell death with single drug
treatments (Fig. 3D).
To further explore whether AMPK is involved in
the synergistic effect from the combination treatment,
we knocked down AMPK-a1 using lentiviral shRNA.
Although AMPK-a1 knockdown generally made the
MDA-MB-468 cells more resistant to metformin

for each cell line. (E), MDA-MB-468 cells were transduced with scramble PLKO.1 and AMPK-a1 shRNA lentiviruses and subjected to
puromycin selection. Cells were further treated with vehicle control, 1 mM metformin (M1), 4 uM erlotinib (E4), or combination (M1+E4).

treatment groups. Mean +

and different doses of phenformin. Mean +

treated with phenformin for 24 hr. (G), MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with vehicle control, 1 mM metformin (M1), 4 uM erlotinib (E4),
or combination (M1+E4) in growth medium (containing 10% FBS, 4 mM glutamine) supplemented with 25 mM, 5 mM or 0 mM glucose.
Mean +
− S.D. of Annexin-V positive cells were shown (n=3).

(Suppl.  Fig. 4), the combination of metformin and
erlotinib still produced synergistic cell death (Fig. 3E). We
also tried a more potent biguanide phenformin. 0.1 mM
of phenformin induced strong AMPK phosphorylation
comparable to 0.8 mM, but the synergistic effect from
combination with erlotinib was only evident at higher
doses as 0.4 or 0.8 mM (Fig. 3F). These data along with

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the data from AICAR (Fig. 2C) suggest that AMPK
activation is not solely responsible for the synergistic
effect for the combination of metformin or phenformin
with erlotinib.
Recent studies show that carbon sources affect the
sensitivity to metformin [27, 38, 39]. We tested the effect
of glucose on the synergism of metformin and erlotinib

10508

PTEN is one determinant of sensitivity to

combination. 25 mM is the high glucose concentration
in regular DMEM medium for MDA-MB-468, and 5
mM of glucose is close to physiological level found in
serum. We found that the synergistic effect at 5 mM was
comparable to 25 mM (Fig. 3G), but diminished in culture
medium without glucose, although cells were generally
more sensitive to either drug alone or combination under
extreme low glucose condition.
Consistent with endogenous BIM expression
in cancer cells being a determinant of apoptotic
responsiveness to kinase inhibitors, including EGFR
inhibitors [40], we observed that the two lines that
did not show evidence of apoptosis upon combined
drug traetment (MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-435S)
expressed the lowest amount of endogenous BIM protein
(Suppl. Fig. 5). All together, these results show that
metformin combined with erlotinib synergize to inhibit
a subset of breast cancer cell lines grown and assayed in
multiple in vitro contexts.

To further investigate whether PTEN affects
sensitivity towards the drug combination, we utilized
isogenic cell line models. We first compared a PTENnull MCF10A line, derived by deletion of exon 2 of
PTEN on both alleles, with its parental MCF10A line.
In addition, we compared the MCF10A parental line
with the PTEN-null line engineered to overexpress both
dominant negative p53 (dnp53) and wild type EGFR
(named “ΔPTEN-dnp53-EGFR”) [41], mimicking these
common concurrent genetic alterations present in BBCs
(Fig. 4A). We observed that the combination treatment
induced cell death in the PTEN-null isogenic cells
and MCF10A ΔPTEN-dnp53-EGFR cells while only
inhibiting proliferation in the PTEN wild type MCF10A
parental cells (Fig. 4B). Both PTEN-null cell lines

were also more sensitive towards metformin treatment
as compared with the parental line. We then looked for
differential inhibition of signaling pathways between the
cell lines. As expected, phosphorylation of EGFR and
AKT were both significantly upregulated in the ΔPTENdnp53-EGFR line and substantially inhibited by treatment
with erlotinib (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the synergy of the
combined treatment could be clearly observed through
enhanced inhibition of S6 in ΔPTEN-dnp53-EGFR cells
as compared with single agent treatments, and this effect
was less pronounced in the MCF10A parental line. To
assess the converse isogenic experiment, we introduced
PTEN into the PTEN-null cell lines MDA-MB-468 and
HCC-1937 which, in both cases, resulted in reduced AKT
phosphorylation and a decrease in synergy (increased
CI) to the drug combination (Suppl. Fig. 6A-D). These
results indicate that loss of PTEN sensitizes breast cancer
cells to combined metformin and erlotinib treatment and
supports the assertion that PTEN status is one determinant
of combined drug treatment sensitivity.
To test whether other PI3K pathway alterations
can induce the synergism, and whether such synergism is
applicable to other cancer types, we treated glioma cancer
cell line H4, lung cancer cell line NCI-H1975, and ovarian
cancer cell line CAOV-3 with metformin or phenformin
(when cell line is resistant to metformin), and erlotinib.
Based on cBio cancer genomics portal [37], H4 cell line
has PTEN homozygous deletion and EGFR amplification;
NCI-H1975 and CAOV-3 both have a PIK3CA mutation
and an EGFR mutation. All three cell lines showed
synergistic and/or additive cell death under combination
treatment (Suppl. Fig. 7), which further confirms that
PTEN status and/or PI3K pathway alteration may be one
of the determinants for the synergism between biguanide
and erlotinib combination, and such synergism can be
applied to cancer types other than breast cancer.

their last treatment) were low [metformin (0.17 µM) and
erlotinib (0.12 µM)]. We asked if altered circulating insulin
played a role in the observed tumor regression but found
that trough plasma insulin levels were not significantly
different between the cohorts (Suppl. Fig. 8). Combined
treatment using a 5-fold lower dose of metformin
(50 mg/kg/day) also inhibited xenografted PTEN null
HCC-70 BBC cells (Suppl. Fig. 9). To thoroughly
understand the drug concentration in plasma, we treated
mice with metformin 50 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg erlotinib and
conducted a pharmacokinetics study (Suppl. Fig. 10). For
erlotinib the Cmax was 7283 ± 1344 ng/mL (18.5 uM) and
the trough level was < 0.25 ng/ml with a terminal half-life of
1.5 hours. For metformin, the Cmax was 1828 ± 259 ng/mL
(14.2 uM), the trough level was 2.9 ± 0.4 ng/ml and the
terminal half-life was 3 hours. There was no accumulation
of either drug consistent with pulse daily dosing
(see supplemental PK data for full modeling details).

Metformin and erlotinib combined to inhibit cell
signaling and induce apoptosis in vivo
Tumors were harvested 24 hours after their last
treatment and assessed by immunohistochemcial staining.
The apoptosis marker, cleaved caspase 3, revealed
significantly more apoptosis (13.6%) in the combined
treated tumors (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, Ki-67 and
phospho-Histone H3 staining showed that proliferation
was not preferentially affected (data not shown). As
expected, control tumors showed very high activation
of EGFR as shown by intense membranous staining of
p-EGFR at the Tyr1143 residue. Erlotinib alone, and
metformin alone (to a lesser extent), reduced EGFR
phosphorylation, while the combined treatment completely
inhibited EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 5D; Suppl. Fig. 11).
Control tumors showed almost no AMPK phosphorylation
while metformin, as shown in both single and combined
treatments, significantly activated AMPK. We found highly
phosphorylated AKT in the control tumors as shown by
intense membranous staining (Fig. 5D). Erlotinib alone
partially reduced AKT phosphorylation and surprisingly,
metformin alone also significantly inhibited AKT
phosphorylation in these tumors. Importantly, we observed
almost complete inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in
tumors treated with the combined therapy. These signaling
changes were all consistent with what was observed in vitro.
These results show that the combination of metformin and
erlotinib synergize to trigger significant apoptosis that
neither drug alone can achieve, while collaborating to inhibit
both upstream and downstream PI3K pathway signaling.

Combination treatment of metformin and
erlotinib induces tumor regression in a mouse
orthotopic transplant model
Next, we assessed the efficacy of the combination
treatment in vivo using an orthotopic transplant MDAMB-468 cell xenograft model. The combination treatment
resulted in tumor regression (28% decrease by volume)
while the individual treatments each only marginally
slowed tumor growth (68% increase by volume in the
cohort treated by metformin and 35% increase by volume
in the cohort treated by erlotinib) over a course of 21 days
(Fig. 5A). Tumor weights at the end of the experiment
confirmed a significant reduction of tumor burden
(69% reduction compared with control) with the drug
combination as compared with single agent treatments
(Fig. 5B). We did not observe any toxicity in any of the
cohorts. Measured plasma trough levels of both drugs

suggests that single agent targeted therapies are unlikely
to be effective in most patients. We show, for the first
time, that metformin can synergize with a targeted drug,
erlotinib, to induce tumor regression in an orthotopic
transplanted BBC model while demonstrating that loss of
PTEN is one potential marker of sensitivity.
We demonstrated that metformin and erlotinib can
have synergistic or additive effects in a significant subgroup
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of BBC cell lines. It was encouraging to find that in most
of the “synergistic” cases, the synergy was caused, at least
in significant part, by induction of apoptosis. Our screen
across a panel of 17 breast cancer lines with known PTEN
mutation status and differential effects seen in the isogenic
cell lines with and without PTEN expression are evidence
that PTEN is a candidate biomarker of sensitivity towards
the drug combination. PTEN expression was present
10511

Oncotarget

among all the cell lines in the antagonistic group with the
exception of HCC-38. Possible explanations for the lack of
synergy in PTEN-null HCC-38 cells include 1) the fact that
it harbors a fusion gene comprised partly of the SLC22A1
gene (which codes for OCT1) fused with CUTA (from
the Sanger mutation database), 2) it has the lowest level
of phosphorylated EGFR among the 17 cell lines (data
not shown) and, 3) existence of other unknown genetic
alterations in the relevant signaling pathways. Further
investigation of the mechanism of resistance towards the
combination treatment in HCC-38 cells is warranted.
Since loss of PTEN increases the synergy of the
drug combination and gain of PTEN decreases the
synergy, the synergy is likely in part due to activation of
the PI3K pathway and thus dependent on a subset of its
signal outputs. Inhibition of one PI3K output, mTOR,
has previously shown to synergize with EGFR inhibition
[42] so one obvious explanation for the observed synergy
is metformin’s ability to directly and indirectly inhibit
mTOR [30, 31]. Although we also confirmed the ability
of metformin to inhibit S6 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation
independently of AMPK activation, the observation that
erlotinib in combination with metformin outperformed
erlotinib in combination with either rapamycin or
AZD8055 (TORC kinase inhibitor) suggests that
additional factors are contributing to our observed synergy.
One observed difference between combining erlotinib with
metformin as opposed to specific mTOR inhibition was a
significant additional decrease in EGFR phosphorylation.
This potentiation of the inhibitory effect of erlotinib on
EGFR by metformin was also not observed when erlotinib
was combined AICAR so it is unlikely due to activation of
AMPK. These observations are novel and require further
study. We also showed that metformin treatment combined
with either an AKT or MEK inhibitor in place of erlotinib
generated an inferior inhibitory effect. These results
may be explained by the fact that there was no observed
stimulatory feedback when erlotinib was combined with
metformin. In fact, the combination of metformin and
erlotinib resulted in potentiation of decreased AKT and
EGFR phosphorylation instead of previously described
feedback resulting in increased phosphorylation of
AKT with rapamycin treatment or increase EGFR
phosphorylation with AKT inhibitor treatment [43, 44].
No other signaling pathway alterations were detected in
RTK antibody array.
Data from TCGA confirms that activation of the
PI3K-AKT pathway is high in the majority of BBCs as
compared with other subtypes of breast cancer [1]. Using
the cBIO Cancer Genomic Portal, we confirmed the wellestablished enrichment of relatively increased EGFR
mRNA in BBC [RNAseq z-score > 1 in 14/81 (28%) of
BBC versus 6/324 (2%) of luminal cases. p < 0.0001 by
Fisher Exact Probability Test] [37]. More importantly, 21
out of 23 of the BBC with “high” EGFR mRNA levels
have a concurrent alteration in the PI3K pathway (PTEN,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

INPP4B, AKT1/2/3, or PIK3CA; data not shown). Instead
of PTEN mutation, BT-20 (a basal line) and MCF7 (a
luminal line) cells in the “synergistic group” harbor
PIK3CA mutations and increased phosphorylation of
EGFR. Thus it is reasonable to suggest that erlotinib and
metformin could have therapeutic potential in any breast
cancer driven by activated EGFR and PI3K pathways.
Importantly, we observed in our short panel of breast
cancer cell lines that although expression of EGFR was
much lower in the luminal cell lines, the phosphorylation
status was very comparable to that of the basal-like lines.
This observation is consistent with the TCGA proteomic
breast cancer data in which, despite the difference in
total EGFR mRNA levels between basal and luminal
cases, levels of phosphorylated EGFR between basal and
luminal subtypes were similar (26% of basal and 24%
of luminal case with p-EGFR protein z-scores > 1) [37].
One could further speculate that the synergy between
EGFR inhibition and metformin may occur in other tumor
types enriched for concurrent EGFR and PI3K pathway
activation, including squamous cell cancers, colorectal
cancer, glioblastoma with EGFR vIII amplification, and
lung cancer with EGFR exon 18 through 21 mutations.
In fact, we detected synergistic cell death from three
other cancer lines H4, CAOV-3 and NCI-H1975, which
harbor either PTEN or PI3KCA mutation and EGFR
amplification or mutation. There is a recent study showing
that metformin synergizes with another EGFR inhibitor
gefitinib in lung cancer cell lines [45].
We also investigated if LKB1, upstream of AMPK,
played any role in the observed synergy. Reducing the
LKB1 protein level via shRNA in MDA-MB-468 cells
showed no effect on synergy towards the drug combination
(data not shown) suggesting that either metformin requires
only a small amount of basal LKB1 to activate AMPK or
metformin’s antineoplastic effects are largely independent
of LKB1. Our cell signaling data suggest that the synergy
is independent of LKB1 and is further supported by our
observation that the drug combination has an additive
effect on SUM-149 cells, which lacks LKB1 expression.
Our data are consistent with the previous observation that
metformin and phenformin were able to delay outgrowth
of PTEN deficient and LKB1 hypomorphoic xenografts in
the absence of significant changes in insulin levels [32].
It has been shown that metformin can inhibit
tumor initiating cells and prevent relapses in vivo when
combined with chemotherapy [21]. In our study, we
found that metformin or erlotinib alone can inhibit
mammosphere formation in multiple BBC cell lines. This
confirms previous findings that EGFR inhibition leads to
reduced mammosphere formation in breast cancer cells
when co-cultured with mesenchymal stem cells [46]. We
showed that combining the two drugs was significantly
more potent compared with either alone and completely
prevented mammosphere formation in multiple BBC
cell lines. The reason for this result warrants further
10512

Oncotarget

investigation and supports the hypothesis that the drug
combination may help prevent relapses in BBC patients.
It is controversial whether the effects of metformin
at high concentrations have translational value.
Metformin was used at doses of 0.5 to 4 mM in many
of our in vitro studies. Although much higher than the
plasma level in patients (about 10 µM) [47], these doses
are lower than most of the published in vitro data, with the
notable exception of metformin’s ability to inhibit tumor
initiating cells [21]. AMPK activation was demonstrated
in muscle biopsies from patients given typical diabetic
doses of metformin which agrees with our data showing
that much lower levels (micromolar) of metformin are
needed in vivo to obtain the same cell signaling changes
which require millimolar concentrations in vitro [48].
Increased p-AMPK (Thr 172) immunohistochemical
staining was also seen in the HCC-70 xenografted tumors
treated with 50 mg/kg/day of metformin (data not shown).
Therefore, the higher concentrations of metformin needed
for in vitro experiments are likely, at least in part, due
to artifacts of non-physiologic tissue culture conditions
[27]. Recently there have been two reports showing that
intermediate concentrations of metformin (300–500
µM) can reprogram cancer cell metabolism [49, 50].
Furthermore, we had the observation that glucose levels
can affect the inhibitory effect of metformin on breast
cancer cells in vitro as others have observed in other
settings [Fig. 3G; [27, 38, 39]]. Under physiological
level of glucose (5 mM), we still observed similar level
of synergism. Although cells in low glucose medium are
more sensitive to treatment, the synergism diminishes
compared to normal glucose level.
There is also evidence that metformin can accumulate
within tissues leading to higher concentrations than plasma
levels [51]. Our immunohistochemistry results demonstrate
that the drug-induced signaling alterations of EGFR, AKT,
and AMPK were maintained 24 hours after administering
the last dose of metformin and erlotinib, corresponding
to the concurrently measured low micromolar plasma
levels of each drug, which is consistent with their reported
half-lives in mice of about 3 hours. We did not observe
differences in plasma insulin levels between the mouse
cohorts, suggesting that the observed signaling effects were
due to a direct interaction of the drugs with tumor cells.
However, the potential effects of altered growth factor
levels by metformin cannot be completely discounted by
our data, especially given the rapid kinetics of growth
factor levels (e.g. the half-life of insulin in mice is 10 min)
[52]. Despite the limitations of our studies, our aggregate
observations, and the ability of the drug combination to
induce apoptosis with resulting tumor regression in vivo,
demonstrates translational potential.
Our study provides evidence that combination
therapy with metformin and erlotinib could have
therapeutic efficacy in cancers driven by EGFR and
PI3K signaling, including a subset of BBC patients, and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

provides a rationale for clinical study. Both metformin
and erlotinib are well-tolerated orally administered ­FDAapproved drugs that can be easily translated into clinical
trials and could serve as a platform for the addition of
other targeted drugs and chemotherapy.

Statement of significance
BBCs make up the large majority of the triple
negative clinical subtype of breast cancers (TNBCs)
and are aggressive tumors deficient of effective targeted
therapies. Our in vitro and in vivo data show that
combining metformin with erlotinib may be considered in
strategies to treat TNBCs, with loss of PTEN expression
as one candidate biomarker of sensitivity.

(metformin  = 0.5 mM, erlotinib = 4 µM, rapamycin  =
10 nM) and their combinations for 3 days. Colonies were

RTK signaling antibody array
MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-well plate and

erlotininb (4 µM) and their combination for 24 hours. The
samples were processed according manufacture’s protocol
(Cell Signaling).

Analysis of cytotoxic interactions between
metformin and erlotinib

Mammosphere formation assay
Cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/well in
ultralow attachment 6-well plate in DMEM/F12 media
supplemented with B27, EGF (20 ng/ml), insulin
(10 µg/ml) and hydrocortisone (70 ng/ml) and allowed to
grow for 6 days. The majority of cells could not survive
under non-attachment conditions and only cells capable
of forming mammospheres proliferated. The number of
mammospheres was counted 6 days after the start of the
drug treatments.

Each cell line seeded at 10,000 cells/well in 48-well
plates was treated with the following drug treatments:
metformin (0.5, 1, 2, 4 mM), erlotinib (2, 4 µM) and
combination of metformin and erlotinib at all these doses.
6 replicates were used for each treatment. Cell viability
was assessed by crystal violet assay after 6 days of drug
treatments. The combination index (CI) reflecting additive
(0.8–1.2), synergistic (< 0.8) and antagonistic (>1.2),
was obtained by using the software Compusyn (version
3.01). We have modified the stringency of the analysis by
defining “additive” as cell lines having CI between 0.8
and 1.2 instead of exactly at 1. This experiment was also
carried out in PTEN-null MDA-MB-468 cells and HCC1937 cells retrovirally transfected with the plasmids 1066
pBabe puroL PTEN (plasmid #10785 from Addgene) and
pBabe -puro (plasmid #1764 from Addgene).

Flow cytometry
Cells were seeded at 60,000 cells/well and treated
with metformin (0.5, 1 or 2 mM) or erlotinib (4 µM) and
their combination. Cells were then trypsinized and stained
with both FITC Annexin V antibody and propidium iodide
(PI) to assay for cell death after 3 days using the FITC
Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (Becton Dickenson).
Procedures were carried out according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis was performed on a BD FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (Becton Dickenson) and the results were
analyzed using the software FlowJo (Tree Star Inc) .

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed with 2X Laemmli buffer. 25  µg
of total proteins were separated by electrophoresis
and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes.
Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies
followed by secondary antibodies and then developed with
an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

In vivo drug treatment study
All animal experiments were conducted according
to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) at Columbia University
Medical Center. 1 million MDA-MB-468 cells mixed
with Matrigel were injected into the mammary fat pad
of each mouse and allowed to grow into tumors with size

of approximately 125 mm3. The mice were randomized
into 4 groups (6 to 7 animals per group) and treated with
metformin alone (250 mg/kg/day), erlotinib alone (50 mg/
kg/day), metformin and erlotinib, or DMSO through
daily oral gavage (6 days per week). Tumor size was
measured every 3 days up to 21 days. 24 hours after the
final drug treatments, tumors were excised and weighted
by a digital scale. Trough plasma levels of metformin
and erlotinib were assessed by ultra performance
liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry
using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB C18 column, an Agilent
1290 UPLC and an Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer. Cmax levels of metformin and erlotinib
were simulated based on individualized compartmental
pharmacokinetic parameters for each drug derived
from earlier reports [51, 54] using a model developed
previously [55] and the MW-Pharm pharmacokinetic
software (Mediware). Plasma insulin level was measured
by ALPCO Insulin Assay according to manufacturer’s
instructions (ALPCO Diagnostics). Excised tumors were
fixed in 10% formalin and stained with various antibodies
for immunohistochemical analysis.
