BACKGROUND. Adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AIs), instead of or after tamoxifen,
are effective in decreasing recurrence in postmenopausal women with estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. An understanding of which patients are at
risk of early recurrence while they are receiving tamoxifen may improve clinical
decision making.

METHODS. The patients who were included in this study were women aged 50
years with early-stage, ER-positive breast cancer diagnosed between 1986 and
1999 and had been treated with tamoxifen. Characteristics of the patients with
early recurrences (within 2.5 years of diagnosis), late recurrences (between 2.5
years and 5 years) and no recurrence within 5 years were compared. Logistic
regression analyses were conducted to identify which groups were at risk of early
recurrence.
RESULTS. Among 3844 women, 304 women (7.9%) developed disease recurrence
within 2.5 years. Higher than average rates of recurrence within 2.5 years were
observed in cohorts with lymph node (N)-positive tumors (11.5%), grade 3 histol-

(14.9%). In multivariate analyses, only pathologically N-positive tumors (1–3 vs 0
2.23 [P 5 .03]) and low-positive ER status (OR, 2.04; P 5 .01) were associated with
recurrence within 2.5 years compared with recurrence between 2.5 years and 5
years. Other clinical and pathologic variables were not predictive of early recurrence.

CONCLUSIONS. Subgroups of women with early ER-positive breast cancer may be
identified who are at increased risk of recurrence within 2.5 years of diagnosis
despite tamoxifen. It remains to be proven whether upfront AI therapy results in
an advantage to these women. Cancer 2008;112:1437–44.  2008 American

of tamoxifen.1–5 American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend that all eligible women
receive therapy with AIs either instead of or after tamoxifen.6 To our knowledge, the optimal treatment
strategy has not been determined to date, and crosstrial comparisons have not demonstrated conclusively whether AI monotherapy or sequential tamoxifen-AI therapy is superior. A potential advantage of
sequential therapy is a reduced risk of toxicity
because of a shorter exposure to either agent. Trials
of sequential tamoxifen-AI therapy have reported an
overall survival benefit,7,8 whereas trials of AI monotherapy versus tamoxifen1,9 have yet to report a survival advantage. A disadvantage of initiating therapy
with tamoxifen may be that women who experience
an early recurrence while they are receiving tamoxifen may lose the opportunity to benefit from adjuvant AI therapy.
Understanding the timing of breast cancer recurrence may be helpful for clinicians in choosing
among various adjuvant endocrine options. The 5year and 10-year risks of breast cancer recurrence
rates are well defined,10,11 and it is known that
patients with ER-positive breast cancer have a relatively constant risk of recurrence between 5 years
and 10 years after diagnosis.12,13 In this study, we
evaluated factors associated with early versus late recurrence among postmenopausal women with ERpositive breast cancer who received tamoxifen to
identify those at risk of early recurrence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study participants were women residents of British
Columbia aged 50 years who had ER-positive breast
cancer diagnosed between 1986 and 1999 and who
received a prescription for tamoxifen from the British
Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) within 1 year of diagnosis. The date of diagnosis was defined as the
earlier of Class IV/V cytology, positive pathology, or,
in the absence of the former, clinical diagnosis.
Women were included if they had breast cancer with
T1/T2 pathologic tumor classification, N0 to N3a
lymph node status, and negative for metastasis
(M0).14 Women were excluded if they had a prior or
synchronous contralateral breast cancer, noninvasive
disease alone, ER-negative or ER-unknown status,
advanced stage (including clinical or pathologic T3/
T4 and clinical N2, N3, or M1 disease), or if they
were referred to the BCCA only after recurrence.
Patients who died of a nonbreast cancer death or
developed a contralateral, new, primary breast cancer
within 5 years of diagnosis and before a recurrence
event also were excluded. Patients underwent defini-

tive surgery, including axillary lymph node dissection, and received adjuvant radiation and systemic
therapy as described in the BCCA cancer management guidelines, which evolved over time.15–17
Data were abstracted from the prospectively
assembled BCCA Breast Cancer Outcomes Unit database, which contains demographic, pathologic, staging, treatment, and outcomes information on all
patients who have been diagnosed with breast cancer
since January 1, 1989 and referred to a BCCA facility.
Pathology characteristics abstracted included lymph
node status (positive or negative), the number of axillary lymph nodes removed and involved with cancer, tumor size, histologic grade, ER status, and the
presence of lymphatic or vascular invasion in the primary tumor (Table 1). Before April 1991, ER status
was determined by dextran-coated charcoal assay,
and tumors were considered ER-positive if they
scored >10 fmol/mg cytosol protein. After April 1991,
ER staining was changed to the Abbott enzyme immunoassay monoclonal biochemical method, and
tumors were considered ER-positive if they
scored >15 fmol/mg. ER staining using the immunohistochemical (IHC) method replaced the biochemical method after April 1992 and was graded
according to the following scale, which was modified
from the Allred scoring system: ER 0, <10% of cells
stained positive (corresponding to Allred score, 0–2);
ER 11, from 10% to 20% of cells stained positive
(Allred score, 3–4); ER 21, from 20% to 60% of cells
stained positive (Allred score, 5–6); and ER 31, from
60% to 100% of cells stained positive (Allred score, 7–
8). The majority of patients had a pathology review
on referral to the BCCA and, if it was done, then the
review diagnosis was used to describe pathologic
characteristics.
The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival. A breast cancer recurrence was defined either
as a local (breast or chest wall), regional (ipsilateral
axillary, infraclavicular, internal mammary, or supraclavicular), or distant recurrence (any other site,
including contralateral lymph nodes) or as death
from breast cancer in the absence of a recorded recurrence. Subsequent contralateral breast cancer was
not included as an endpoint, because the objective
of the study was to characterize patterns of recurrence in the primary breast only. Patients were
assigned to 1 of 3 groups according to their recurrence status. Group 1 (early recurrence) experienced
a breast cancer recurrence within 2.5 years of diagnosis, Group 2 (late recurrence) experienced a recurrence between 2.5 years and 5 years after diagnosis,
and Group 3 (no recurrence) included women who
had no documented recurrence within the first 5

years. Women who experienced a recurrence >5
years after diagnosis were included in Group 3. Univariate analysis was performed on selected patient,
tumor, and treatment characteristics. Chi-square
tests and analyses of variance were conducted to
compare the distribution of characteristics between
the 3 groups.
Because the proportional hazards assumption
required for a Cox regression model was not met, binary logistic regression analyses were chosen to estimate the likelihood of an early event by comparing
Group 1 (early recurrence) with Group 3 (no recurrence) and by comparing Group 1 (early recurrence)
with Group 2 (late recurrence). A variable’s effect on
early recurrence was estimated by the model’s odds
ratio (OR). A 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was
calculated for each OR. Women were excluded from
the multivariate analyses if values for any of the
selected variables were unknown.
Annual recurrence ratios (for each year after diagnosis) were defined as the fraction of patients who
recurred during each 1-year interval. All statistical
analyses were performed with SPSS (version 14.0)
software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). This study was
approved by the Research Ethics Board of the BCCA,
University of British Columbia.

RESULTS
There were 3844 women who met the study eligibility criteria and were included in the study. The median follow-up of the patients who remained alive
was 9.1 years, and all patients had a minimum 5
years of follow-up. The median age was 65 years and
was similar between the 3 recurrence-timing cohorts.

All patients received tamoxifen, and 15.4% of patients
received chemotherapy. In total, 28.6% of patients
had stage I breast cancer, 58.3% of patients had stage
II breast cancer, and 13% of patients had stage III
breast cancer.14 Table 1 shows the distributions of
age and pathologic and treatment characteristics for
the 3 recurrence-timing cohorts. There were 304
patients (7.9%) who developed disease recurrence
within the first 2.5 years of diagnosis (Group 1), 283
patients (7.4%) who developed disease recurrence
between 2.5 years and 5 years of diagnosis (Group 2),
and 3257 patients (84.7%) who experienced no recurrence within the first 5 years. Compared with
patients who developed disease recurrence between
2.5 years and 5 years, patients with early recurrence
were more likely to have higher histologic grade, to
have low ER positivity, to have higher lymph node
burden, and to undergo mastectomy (Table 1). The
distribution of all variables differed significantly
between patients who recurred early (Group 1) and
those who did not develop a recurrence (Group 3),
with the exception of surgical margin status, the
number of lymph nodes removed, and the receipt of
adjuvant chemotherapy.
Table 2 shows the proportions of patients that
developed disease recurrence within 2.5 years,
developed disease recurrence between 2.5 years
and 5 years, and did not recur within 5 years, overall and for selected subgroups defined by lymph
node involvement, grade, and ER positivity. Overall,
7.9% of patients developed disease recurrence
within 2.5 years of diagnosis. A higher rate of recurrence was observed in patients with lymph nodepositive disease, grade 3 histology, or low-positive
ER status.

Multivariate comparisons of the characteristics
between Groups 1 and 3 and between Groups 1 and
2 are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Grade 3
tumors (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.88–3.42), low ER level
(OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.56–3.32), and positive lymph
nodes were associated significantly with an increased
risk of recurrence within 2.5 years compared with no
recurrence within 5 years (Table 3). Women who had
low-positive ER tumors and those with involved axil-

lary lymph nodes were significantly more likely to
have an early recurrence rather than a later recurrence (Table 4). Compared with the lymph node-negative cohort, patients who had from 4 to 9 positive
lymph nodes were twice as likely to have an early recurrence rather than a later recurrence (OR, 2.23;
95% CI, 1.22–4.09). With from 1 to 3 positive lymph
nodes, the OR for early recurrence was 1.60 (95% CI,

from 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes was associated with
a high recurrence risk (5% per year), which persisted to 10 years after diagnosis. Women who had
from 1 to 3 involved lymph nodes had a 3% to 4%
per year risk of recurrence that persisted to 10 years.
Women who had lymph node-negative tumors had a
persistent approximately 2% per year recurrence risk.

DISCUSSION

FIGURE 3. Annual breast cancer recurrence rates according to lymph

This study demonstrated that, among women with
ER-positive, early-stage breast cancer who received

node (N) classification for women with N0 tumors (n 5 1819), N1 tumors
(n 5 1522), or N2 tumors (n 5 405).

Risk of Early Recurrence on Tamoxifen/Kennecke et al.

treatment with definitive local therapy plus tamoxifen,
lymph node-positive status, grade 3 tumors, or lowpositive ER level tumors had a high absolute rate of
breast cancer recurrence within 2.5 years after diagnosis. Lymph node positivity and low-positive ER levels
also were associated significantly with the risk of early
recurrence compared with delayed recurrence
between 2.5 years and 5 years. The impact on timing
of recurrence of locally advanced presentation was
not assessed, because these patients were excluded
from the study.
Analyses of annual breast cancer recurrence rates
demonstrated the differing effects of grade, ER level,
and lymph node status on the timing of recurrence.
The risk of recurrence for high-grade and low-positive
ER tumors peaked during the second year after diagnosis and declined thereafter. In contrast, a high positive lymph node count was associated with a high
early recurrence risk that remained high throughout
the follow-up interval.
Previous studies demonstrated that high grade is
prognostic of poorer outcomes among women with
ER-positive early breast cancers.18–20 Low ER levels,
as determined by both biochemical and IHC
assays21,22 also reportedly are predictive of poorer
outcomes among tamoxifen-treated patients. In a
report from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group, tamoxifen-treated patients who had
tumors with ER levels >100 fmol/mg cytosol of protein experienced fewer recurrences (49%  10) compared with patients who had tumors that expressed
ER levels from 10 to 100 fmol/mg (36%  8).11
Although the benefits of therapy should be determined from prospective trials, the absolute 2.5-year
risk estimates presented in Table 2 may allow the
calculation of the theoretical absolute benefit of
upfront AI in place of tamoxifen. For example,
assuming a hazards ratio of 0.83 with upfront AI
instead of tamoxifen,4 if a postmenopausal woman
with from 4 to 9 positive lymph nodes and a 17.5%
risk of recurrence within the first 2.5 years were treated with an AI instead of tamoxifen, then the absolute benefit potentially would be 2.9% at 2.5 years. If
a woman with lymph node-negative breast cancer
and a 3.9% risk of recurrence within the first 2.5
years were treated with an AI instead of tamoxifen,
then her absolute benefit would be only 0.66%.
The risk-benefit calculations described above
were based on retrospective data, and only randomized prospective trials can determine whether AI
therapy is more beneficial than tamoxifen independent of the risk of early recurrence as identified in the
current study. This appears to be the true: In a subset analysis of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in

1443

Combination (ATAC) trial, there was a trend toward a
benefit for anastrozole in all subgroups based on
grade; however, the benefit was significant only in
the moderately differentiated subgroup.4,9 In the
lymph node-positive subset, there was a trend toward superiority for anastrozole; however, in the
lymph node-negative subset, there was a significant
benefit.4,9 This pattern was reversed in the Breast
Intergroup (BIG) 1–98 trial, in which letrozole was
superior to tamoxifen in the lymph node-positive
subsets but not in the lymph node-negative subsets,1
which the investigators believed was because of a
lack of events in the early analysis. It should be
noted that these subgroup analyses often were not
predefined and were exploratory and under-powered.
Central subset analyses of tumor blocks of
patients enrolled in the ATAC and BIG 1–98 trials23,24
demonstrated that AIs were superior to tamoxifen irrespective of the degree of positivity of ER, HER-2 status,
and progesterone receptor (PgR) status. In the neoadjuvant literature, Ellis et al. reported that letrozole was
superior to tamoxifen at all levels of ER expression
between Allred scores of 3 and 8.25 In the Immediate
Preoperative Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, or Combined
with Tamoxifen trial, anastrozole was equivalent to tamoxifen at high ER levels and was slightly better than
tamoxifen at lower ER levels26; however, those differences were not statistically significant.
Because PgR and HER-2 levels were not available
for the majority of patients in the current study, their
prognostic value for early recurrence could not be
assessed. Among 728 patients with known negative
HER-2 status in the current study, there were 75
patients in Group 1 (10.3%), 69 patients in Group 2
(9.5%), and 584 patients in Group 3 (80.2%). This distribution did not differ significantly from distribution
in the overall cohort reported herein (7.9%, 7.4%,
and 84.7%, respectively). Because of small sample
sizes, multivariate analyses of the residual effects of
grade, ER level, and the number of involved lymph
nodes could not be carried out in the HER-2 negative
subset.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the risk of early recurrence among a geographically defined population of postmenopausal women
with ER-positive breast cancer who were treated with
tamoxifen. Until recently, the timing of recurrence
has not been an important clinical factor in the
selection of adjuvant hormone therapy. However, in
the era of multiple effective adjuvant hormone strategies, the timing of recurrence may have clinical
relevance. The current study illustrates that, among
women with ER-positive, tamoxifen-treated, earlystage breast cancer, standard pathologic markers

may be used to identify subgroups at higher risk of
early recurrence. Current and planned randomized
trials, including those evaluating molecular markers
as selection criteria for adjuvant therapy, are awaited
to better define the optimal short- and long-term
hormone therapeutic strategy for patients with ERpositive breast cancer. ER-positive breast cancer
undoubtedly is a heterogeneous disease; and, as our
understanding of the various subgroups improves, a
‘‘1-size-fits-all’’ approach to hormone therapy may
give way to individualized therapeutic strategies.
