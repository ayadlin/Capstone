Abstract
There is growing evidence that antiangiogenic therapy stimulates cancer cell invasion and metastasis. However,
the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for these changes have not been fully deﬁned. Here, we report
that anti-VEGF therapy promotes local invasion and metastasis by inducing collagen signaling in cancer cells. We
show that chronic VEGF inhibition in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDA) induces hypoxia, a less differentiated mesenchymal-like tumor cell phenotype, TGF-b expression, and
collagen deposition and signaling. In addition, we show that collagen signaling is critical for protumorigenic activity
of TGF-b in vitro. To further model the impact of collagen signaling in tumors, we evaluated PDA in mice lacking
Sparc, a protein that reduces collagen binding to cell surface receptors. Importantly, we show that loss of Sparc
increases collagen signaling and tumor progression. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that collagen actively
promotes PDA spread and that enhanced disease progression associated with anti-VEGF therapy can arise from
elevated extracellular matrix–mediated signaling. Cancer Res; 74(4); 1032–44. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor growth beyond a few millimeters in diameter
requires the establishment of a tumor-associated vasculature
(1). This neovascularization is mediated by the activity of
soluble growth factors, most notably VEGF, on existing endothelium (2). The reliance of tumors on a blood supply suggests
that blocking angiogenesis would restrain tumor growth and
dissemination (1, 3). Indeed, transplantation, genetic, and
pharmacologic approaches using animal models have demonstrated that blocking tumor angiogenesis represents a viable
therapeutic avenue, and several antiangiogenic agents are in
various phases of clinical testing or are approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA; refs. 4, 5). The vast
majority of these target VEGF or its receptors, VEGF receptors
1 and 2 (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2).
Despite the progress from conception to FDA-approved
therapy, preclinical success has not always translated to a
robust clinical response for drugs that inhibit angiogenesis (5).

Tumors that do respond to antiangiogenic treatment often
eventually relapse. Even more challenging, patients with glioblastoma multiforme treated with the anti-VEGF monoclonal
antibody (mAb) bevacizumab had rapid tumor dissemination
following a period of primary tumor response (6). A similar
effect was observed in preclinical models of glioblastoma
multiforme and pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (PNET)
using the anti-VEGFR2 antibody DC101 and the small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib (7). These observations
suggest that antiangiogenic therapy can, in some patients,
promote tumor growth and spread.
The effect of anti-VEGF therapy on progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has not been studied in
detail. PDA results in almost a quarter million deaths yearly
worldwide. In the United States, approximately 90% of patients
diagnosed with PDA present with metastatic disease and have
a median survival of less than 1 year (8). Preclinical studies have
shown that antiangiogenic therapy can suppress the growth of
PDA xenografts and prolong the survival of mice bearing PDA
tumors (9, 10). Yet, in two separate phase III trials, patients with
metastatic PDA failed to show any increase in overall survival
when bevacizumab was added to the standard of care agent
gemcitabine (CALGB 80303) or gemcitabine þ erlotinib (AViTA;
refs. 11, 12).
Tumors develop and progress in the context of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM of several different cancer
types, especially PDA, is robust and rich in ﬁbrillar collagens,
which have been proposed to be a major barrier to chemoresponse (13, 14). Collagen signaling facilitates TGF-b–mediated
changes in tumor cell phenotype and can promote tumor cell
survival and chemoresistance. This is particularly relevant to
PDA, which is a desmoplastic disease (13, 15). Each cell in the

Collagen Signaling Drives PDA

PDA microenvironment interacts with ﬁbrillar collagen, which
has the potential to impact cell signaling events via cross-talk of
its receptors with other signal cascades (15). Our goal was to
study the biology of anti-VEGF therapy in a robust preclinical
model of PDA and determine whether therapy-induced hypoxia
drives changes in the ECM that contribute to the poor response
of these tumors to therapy.
We assessed the effect of the anti-VEGF mAb, mcr84 (16), in
a clinically relevant genetically engineered mouse model
(GEMM) of PDA. We found that mcr84 induced hypoxia,
restrained tumor growth, and prolonged survival; yet, tumors
from mcr84-treated mice exhibited a less differentiated phenotype and had increased metastatic burden. Furthermore,
these tumors contained higher levels of ﬁbrillar collagen and
elevated collagen signaling, which includes activation of discoidin domain receptor 1 (Ddr1), protein tyrosine kinase 2
(Pyk2), and pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 (Peak1).
We also found that secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine
(Sparc) blocked collagen I from binding to Ddr1, and that PDA
tumors grown in Sparc/ mice (17, 18) exhibited increased
collagen signaling and enhanced disease progression, similar
to tumors from mice treated chronically with anti-VEGF
therapy. Our ﬁndings support that collagen enhances PDA
and that Sparc functions to limit collagen-induced activation
of Ddr1. Furthermore, these studies suggest that VEGF-blockade can promote tumorigenicity of PDA cells by promoting
hypoxia-induced collagen production and stimulation of Ddr1.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
mPLR cell line isolation. Isogenic cell lines were derived
from 5-week-old KIC transgenic (LSL-KrasG12D; Cdkn2alox/lox;
p48Cre) and Sparc/; KIC (LSL-KrasG12D; Cdkn2alox/lox;
p48Cre; Sparc/) mice. Mouse pancreata from 5-week-old
Sparcþ/þ; KIC and Sparc/; KIC mice were minced and then
subjected to digestion with 1% collagenase type I, Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), 10 mmol/L
HEPES, 1% FBS, and PBS at 37 C until a single-cell suspension was obtained. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at low
speed to pellet large debris, resuspended in wash buffer, and
passed through a 70-mm cell strainer. The resulting cell
suspension was plated at low density to isolate tumor cell
populations using cloning rings. Cells were conﬁrmed to be
tumor cells by immunocytochemistry and PCR. These cell
lines were expanded and stained for tumor cell markers. Cell
lines were conﬁrmed to be pathogen-free before use. Clones
mPLRB8 (Sparcþ/þ) and mPLR6C (Sparc/) were used in
subsequent experiments. Cells were cultured in DMEM
containing 5% FBS and maintained at 37 C in a humidiﬁed
incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% air.
Animal studies
All animals were housed in a pathogen-free facility with
access to food and water ad libitum. Experiments were
approved and performed in accordance with the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX). LSL-KrasG12D;
Cdkn2alox/lox; p48Cre (KIC) mice were generated as previously

www.aacrjournals.org

described (19, 20). Of note, 28- to 30-day-old mice were
randomized to receive treatment as indicated in Table 1. mcr84
and 1D11 were puriﬁed in our laboratory from tissue culture
supernatant using Protein A or G afﬁnity chromatography.
The hybridoma producing 1D11 (21) was obtained from the
Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (http://dshb.biology.
uiowa.edu/). For endpoint studies, experiments were stopped
after 4 weeks of therapy. For survival studies, therapy was
maintained until mice were moribund. At the time of sacriﬁce,
all mice were subjected to careful necropsy where visible metastases were noted and organs were harvested for tissue analysis.
Liver micrometastasis was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) on the anterior lobes of the liver as well as quantitative
PCR (qPCR) for recombined Cdkn2a (Ink4a/Arf) allele.
Histology. Formalin-ﬁxed tissues were embedded in parafﬁn, sectioned, and stained with Masson's Trichrome, Alcian
Blue-PAS, or Picrosirius Red by the Molecular Pathology Core
(University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies against: phospho-Ddr1 (Tyr792; Cell Signaling Technology; #11994), Ddr1
(D1G6; Cell Signaling Technology; #5583), phospho-Src
(Tyr416; Cell Signaling Technology; #2101), phospho-Pyk2
(Tyr402; Cell Signaling Technology; #3291), phospho-p130 Cas
(Tyr165; Cell Signaling Technology; #4015), a-amylase
(D55H10; Cell Signaling Technology; #3796), vimentin (Millipore; AB5733), endomucin clone V.5C7 (Millipore; MAB2624),
NG2 clone 132.38 (Millipore; 05-710), Peak1 (Millipore; 09-274),
and phospho-Peak1 (Tyr665; Millipore; #ABT52). Fluorescent
images were captured with Photometric Coolsnap HQ camera
using NIS Elements AR 2.3 Software (Nikon). Color images were
obtained with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope by using a
Nikon Digital Dx1200me camera and ACT1 software (Universal
Imaging Corporation). Pictures were analyzed using NIS
Elements (Nikon).
Immunocytochemistry
Cell lines were cultured in 4-well chamber slides. Cells were
then ﬁxed with methanol, washed with PBS, permeabilized
with PBSþ0.1% Triton X-100, and then blocked with
TBSþTween 20 (TBST)þ20% Aquablock. Antibodies diluted
in TBSTþ5% bovine serum albumin were added and allowed
to incubate overnight at 4 C. Cells were then washed with
PBS and incubated overnight with the appropriate secondary
antibodies. Following another round of washes with PBS,
coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Hypoxia studies
Hypoxia studies with pimonidazole in vivo. Three mice
per group were injected intravenously with 60 mg/kg of
pimonidazole (30 mg/mL in 0.9% saline, Hypoxyprobe Plus;
HPI Inc.) that was allowed to circulate for 90 minutes before
sacriﬁcing animals. Frozen tissue sections were interrogated
with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated anti-pimonidazole primary antibody (Chemicon) and endothelial cell
markers (CD31, Dianova; Meca-32, DSHB; or endomucin, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Eight images per tissue area were
obtained and analyzed by using NIS Elements.

Hypoxia studies with hypoxic chamber in vitro. Cell
lines were grown in 4-well chamber slides in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 1% O2 in a modular
incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberger) for 48 hours. For
control conditions, cells were cultivated in an incubator with
a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 20% O2
(normoxic conditions). Immunocytochemical analysis was
conducted for the validation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a
(HIF-1a) induction.
Liquid colony-forming assay
Cell lines were cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates at low
density (250 cells/well) in 2 mL of 5% DMEM. Cells were plated
on respective culture conditions and allowed to settle for 72 to
96 hours, or until signiﬁcant colony formation. Cells were then
ﬁxed with 10% formalin and stained with crystal violet. Images
were analyzed with ImageJ or NIS Elements.
Sircol collagen assay
Cell lines were prepared as indicated by the Sircol manual
(Sircol Collagen Assay Kit; Oubis Ltd.). Sircol dye reagent is
used to saturate the collagen in a sample. The principle of the
Sircol collagen assay is the binding of a dye to collagen. A

by centrifugation, eluted with alkali, and measured by using a
spectrophotometer at 555 nm. The intensity of color measurement is proportional to the collagen concentration in a sample.
Western blot analysis
Subconﬂuent monolayers of cells were lysed, supernatants
were recovered by centrifugation, protein concentrations were
measured, and equal amounts of total protein were separated
by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad) followed by a blockade in 5% milk in TBST. The membranes were incubated
overnight at 4 C with primary antibody. The membranes were
then incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)–conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce Biotechnology).
Speciﬁc bands were detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on
autoradiographic ﬁlm.

Results
Angiogenic stress and elevated VEGF in murine PDA
model
Human PDAs frequently contain an activating mutation in
the oncogene KRAS, and an inactivating mutation in the tumor
suppressor CDKN2A (INK4A/ARF; refs. 22, 23). Mice that harbor
analogous genetic alterations speciﬁcally in the pancreas (LSLKrasG12D; Cdkn2alox/lox; p48Cre, abbreviated here as KIC) develop

www.aacrjournals.org

aggressive, invasive pancreatic tumors (19, 24). Histologic
analysis of pancreatic tissue harvested from KIC animals
revealed that these mice develop pancreatic intraepithelial
lesions that progress to invasive carcinoma by the time the
mice are 4- 8-week old (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Alcian BluePAS staining of mucin-containing ducts showed the loss of
normal ductal architecture and function during the progression of PDA in KIC mice (Supplementary Fig. S1A), whereas
Picrosirius Red and trichrome analysis revealed that KIC
tumors have more collagen than WT pancreata (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
We evaluated vascular parameters in normal pancreatic and
PDA tissue at various time points (Fig. 1). NG2þ pericytes were
localized to endomucin-expressing endothelial cells in normal
pancreatic tissue and in pancreatic tissue harvested from 4and 7-week-old KIC mice (Fig. 1A). We found that microvessel
density was signiﬁcantly lower in PDA tissue than normal
pancreas (Fig. 1B). However, endothelial cells in the tumors
were proliferative (Fig. 1C) and displayed an angiogenic phenotype, typiﬁed by the presence of sprouts, which were not
present in the vasculature of normal pancreas (Fig. 1D). We
also observed that the expression level of VEGF was higher in
PDA tissue than normal pancreatic tissue (Fig. 1E).
VEGF blockade prolongs PDA survival and increases
hypoxia, TGF-b activity, and collagen deposition
To determine the contribution of VEGF to PDA progression,
KIC mice (4-week old) were treated with saline, mouse chimeric r84 (mcr84), or mcr84 þ gemcitabine (Fig. 2A–H

inhibits VEGF stimulation of VEGFR2 (16). Four weeks of
therapy with mcr84 or mcr84 þ gemcitabine reduced tumor
burden as assessed by amylase expression (Fig. 2A and B) and
total pancreas weight (Fig. 2C). Anti-VEGF therapy alone
reduced primary tumor weight by 36% (P < 0.05 vs. saline),
whereas mcr84 þ gemcitabine reduced tumor weight by 65%
(P < 0.0001 vs. saline; Fig. 2C). To determine whether anti-VEGF

was maintained until animals were moribund (Table 1). The
median survival of each treatment cohort was determined.
Mice that received saline had a median survival of 56 days,

while treatment with mcr84 or the combination extended
median survival to 56 and 82 days, respectively (Fig. 2D).
However, at the time of sacriﬁce, liver metastatic burden was
higher in mice receiving mcr84. The extent of liver metastasis
was determined by qPCR for the recombined Cdkn2a allele
(Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S2A) and histologic evaluation
of macrometastases (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The incidence
of metastasis calculated by histology was 35%, 63%, and 46% in

The observation that anti-VEGF therapy did not reduce
metastatic burden is similar to prior studies (7, 25), which
reported that anti-VEGF therapy drove phenotypic changes in
tumor cells consistent with a loss of differentiation. To

after treatment with mcr84, we evaluated histology (H&E
and trichrome) of the primary tumors and expression of
epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Tumors harvested
from mice in the survival study treated with mcr84 alone
or in combination with gemcitabine displayed a loss of
differentiation by histology (Fig. 2F) and a dramatic increase
in Masson's Trichrome stain, an indicator of collagen deposition (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Consistent with
the histologic changes, expression of E-cadherin, a typical
marker of epithelial cells, was reduced while expression of
the mesenchymal markers, zeb1 and vimentin, were elevated

Therapy-induced hypoxia is a predicted outcome of VEGF
blockade and has been reported to drive an aggressive tumor
phenotype (7, 25, 26). To validate the general mechanism of
mcr84, microvessel density and the level of hypoxia were
determined. mcr84 alone or in combination with gemcitabine
signiﬁcantly reduced tumor microvessel density (Fig. 3A). This
was coupled with an elevation in hypoxia as measured by
companion studies using pimonidazole (Fig. 3B). Concordant
with the induction of hypoxia, the expression of collagen I, HIF1a, and hexokinase II were elevated in tumors from mice

(27) that stimulates collagen expression and deposition (28),
was elevated signiﬁcantly following mcr84 therapy (Fig. 3C).
These results suggest that anti-VEGF therapy induces hypoxia,
which in turn drives TGF-b–stimulated activity including
collagen deposition and epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT). To model this in vitro, primary murine KIC PDA cells
were plated on collagen and treated with TGF-b under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We found that hypoxia stimulated soluble collagen secretion by PDA cells and primary

to the in vivo observations, in vitro stimulation with TGF-b
drove morphologic changes consistent with a loss of differentiation and promoted loss of E-cadherin, gain of vimentin
expression, and protection from hypoxia-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 3D and E). To determine whether collagen was critical to
the effect of TGF-b, cells were plated on plastic or collagen and
stimulated with TGF-b. TGF-b treatment in the absence of
collagen resulted in induction of apoptosis but limited change
in expression of E-cadherin or vimentin. In contrast, cells
plated on collagen and treated with TGF-b underwent EMT

and were protected from TGF-b–induced apoptosis (Fig. 3F
and G).
To evaluate the contribution of TGF-b to the tumor cell
changes in vivo, we treated KIC mice with 1D11, a mAb that
binds and inhibits each isoform of mouse TGF-b (21). KIC
mice were treated with saline (n ¼ 4), mcr84 þ gemcitabine
(n ¼ 5), 1D11 (n ¼ 7), 1D11þmcr84 (n ¼ 7), or the triple
combination (n ¼ 8) for 4 weeks starting at 4 weeks of age
(Table 1). 1D11 did not reduce primary tumor growth and
abrogated the survival beneﬁt of mcr84 þ gemcitabine
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). However, blockade of TGF-b
with 1D11 reduced liver metastatic events more than treatment with mcr84 and dramatically curtailed mcr84-induced
collagen deposition (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4B
and S4C).
To determine whether TGF-b blockade affected collagen
signaling, we analyzed the activation status of the collagen
receptor Ddr1 and signaling intermediates (Pyk2 and Src)
thought to function downstream of this receptor (29). Tumors
from mice treated with mcr84 þ gemcitabine had elevated
levels of phosphorylated Ddr1, Pyk2, and Src. Treatment with
1D11 signiﬁcantly reduced the level of each phosphorylated
target (Fig. 4B–D). We also evaluated the level of active
pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase I (Peak1), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase previously linked to Src activity and
ECM signaling (30, 31). Phosphorylated Peak1 levels were also
elevated in tumors from mice treated with mcr84 þ gemcitabine but reduced to baseline levels by TGF-b blockade (Fig. 4E).
In addition, the mesenchymal marker vimentin was elevated by
mcr84 in combination with gemcitabine and this was reduced
by TGF-b blockade (Fig. 4F). These results suggest that collagen levels and collagen-mediated signaling increase in PDA
tumors treated with anti-VEGF therapy and that blockade of
collagen deposition via TGF-b inhibition decrease collagenmediated signaling.
Sparc inhibits collagen–Ddr1 interaction
Because of the challenges of interpreting the effect of loss of
collagen signaling in the context of TGF-b inhibition (32), we
sought to model enhanced collagen signaling in PDA using
mice deﬁcient in secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine
(Sparc). Structural studies indicate that SPARC and the discoidin domain receptors (DDR) bind to the same epitope
(GVMGFO) on ﬁbrillar collagens (33, 34). To determine whether SPARC interferes with collagen binding to DDR1, we evaluated the effect of recombinant human SPARC on the binding
of human DDR1/Fc to immobilized collagen I in an ELISA-type
assay. SPARC reduced DDR1 binding to collagen in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). To assess the effect of
Sparc in vivo, we crossed Sparc/ animals with KIC mice. The
absence of endogenous Sparc resulted in reduced survival and
increased primary tumor size (Fig. 5B and C and Supplementary Fig. S5A). In addition, tumors in Sparc/ mice were less
differentiated as determined by reduced mucin expression by
Alcian Blue-PAS histology (Fig. 5D). The increase in progression in the absence of Sparc correlated with a greater activation
of Ddr1 and increased staining of mesenchymal marker
(vimentin). This suggests that the elevation of collagen signal-

www.aacrjournals.org

ing is due to increased collagen binding to the surface of tumor
cells in the Sparc/ KIC model (Fig. 5E–J). Consistent with
this, the activation of Ddr1, Src, Pyk2, and Peak1 was elevated in
tumors from Sparc/ animals (Fig. 5E–H), whereas the level of
total Peak1 was not different between tumors in Sparcþ/þ and
Sparc/ mice (Fig. 5I). In addition, vimentin levels were
elevated in tumors from Sparc/ mice (Fig. 5J).
Increased collagen deposition and signaling drives DDRmediated PDA progression
To investigate how Sparc interferes with collagen-stimulated Ddr1 signaling, primary cell lines developed from Sparcþ/þ
and Sparc/ KIC tumors were plated on ﬁbronectin and
stimulated with soluble collagen (Fig. 6). These PDA cells
differentially express collagen receptors, Sparc, and collagen
(Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C). Maximal activation of DDRs
occurs after 4 hours (35). We found that a 4-hour stimulation
with collagen resulted in robust activation of Ddr1, Pyk2, Src,
and Peak1 (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, Peak1 activation seems to be
more potently induced by collagen I rather than collagen IV
(Fig. 6B; ref. 35) and collagen-induced Peak1 activation was
elevated in cells that lack Sparc (Fig. 6C and Supplementary
Figs. S5C and S6A). We also found that activation of Peak1 by
collagen was sensitive to Ddr1 blockade by an anti-DDR1
antibody (36) or recombinant human SPARC (Fig. 6D and
Supplementary Fig. S6B). Ddr1 blockade had functional consequences as it reduced collagen-supported colony-forming
capabilities of primary PDA cell lines (Fig. 6E), as well as
migration in the presence of Ddr1 inhibitors (Supplementary
Fig. S6B).

Discussion
The goal of this project was to assess the effect of anti-VEGF
therapy on PDA and determine whether changes in ECM
contribute to tumor response to therapy. We found that the
anti-VEGF mAb mcr84 reduced microvessel density, induced
hypoxia, restrained tumor growth, and prolonged survival, yet,
tumors from mcr84-treated mice exhibited epithelial plasticity
and were more aggressive. We observed that VEGF inhibition
increased TGF-b–dependent collagen deposition and collagen
I–mediated signaling through Ddr1. Furthermore, we provide
evidence that the recently identiﬁed kinase Peak1 is a signaling
intermediate downstream of Ddr1 and that the matricellular
protein Sparc reduces collagen I signaling through Ddr1. These
ﬁndings highlight that collagen signaling through Ddr1 is a
critical feature in the response of PDA to therapy and are
summarized in Fig. 6F.
Numerous reports (7, 26, 37–40) have identiﬁed increased
tumor aggressiveness in murine models of cancer after antiangiogenic therapy. In each of these studies, therapy-induced
hypoxia is a central mechanistic feature of the resulting tumor
phenotype. Hypoxia-driven expression and/or activation of
speciﬁc signaling cascades (e.g., c-Met, Axl, and CTGF), recruitment of tumor promoting immune cells, or induction of cell
survival pathways including autophagy are supported by
these and other reports (41–43). Our study is the ﬁrst to show
that hypoxia-induced driven changes in the ECM contribute
to the aggressiveness of tumors after anti-VEGF therapy.

Importantly, therapies that drive hypoxia do not always
increase epithelial plasticity and tumor aggressiveness. For
example, we have found that some antiangiogenic strategies,
including PG545, a heparanase inhibitor and BIBF1120, a
multi-angiokinase inhibitor, potently increase hypoxia but do
not increase epithelial plasticity or metastasis in pancreatic
tumors in mice (20, 44). Interestingly, neither strategy
increased collagen deposition.
Our studies relied on the use of the KIC model of PDA. One of
the notable features of the KIC model is that the tumors often
exhibit histologic features (sarcomatoid change) that are associated with aggressive clinical behavior in human cancers.
Concordantly, PDAs arise in the KIC model with short latency,
are desmoplastic and lethal (19, 24, 32). Tumors are ﬁrst
detected at 3 to 4 weeks of age and deaths from cancer occur
by 8 to 10 weeks. These features make the KIC model particularly well-suited for endpoint and survival studies, which can
be performed more rapidly and efﬁciently in this model than in

1040

other PDA GEMMs. Furthermore, human PDA displays a
spectrum of histologies and response characteristics that
mirror those of the KIC GEMM. In addition, this model
incorporates the two most common genetic lesions present
in human PDA tumors (e.g., KRAS activation and INK4a loss).
We attempted to evaluate the contribution of TGF-b to PDA
progression in the context of anti-VEGF therapy. Our studies
show that TGF-b is a major driver of collagen deposition;
however, TGF-b has pleiotropic effects that include tumor
suppression even in established KIC tumors. Thus, blockade of
TGF-b increased tumor progression and reduced animal survival, results that are consistent with Hezel and colleagues (32).
Importantly, we found that TGF-b blockade resulted in a
reduction in metastatic burden in the liver as assessed by
qPCR. We propose that inhibition of Ddr1 might be a functional alternative to direct TGF-b inhibition. In support of
this, we identiﬁed that collagen I signaling enhanced the
tumorigenic properties of TGF-b in vitro. In addition, collagen

multiple cell types (45), including stromal and tumor cells,
though tumor cells often lose SPARC expression via hypermethylation (46, 47) and this correlates directly with poor
chemoresponse (48). We found that Sparc blocked collagen I
from binding to Ddr1, and that PDA tumors grown in Sparc/
mice exhibited increased collagen signaling and enhanced
disease progression. This is supported by the following observations: (i) the amino acids that comprise the Sparc-binding
region on ﬁbrillar collagens is the same sequence recognized by
Ddr1 (34, 49); (ii) collagen is associated preferentially with cell
surfaces instead of being deposited into the ECM in the
absence of Sparc (50); (iii) TGF-b–induced EMT is potentiated
by collagen interaction with the cell surface (29); (iv) loss of
Sparc expression by tumor cells correlates with the switch of
TGF-b from a suppressor to a promoter of PDA (46, 47); and (v)
pancreatic tumor cells are more aggressive in preclinical
models of PDA in the absence of Sparc (51, 52). Furthermore,
these results are consistent with reports that collagen is
associated with cellular processes that are prominent in PDA,
including EMT and chemoresistance (13, 29). Activation of
DDR signaling is likely context-dependent and may preferentially affect the cell that produces the collagen. Multiple cell
types, including tumor cells, secrete collagen I in the tumor
microenvironment. It is plausible that this collagen provides
autocrine stimulation, especially in the absence of Sparc (50).
In aggregate, these studies suggest that inhibition of collagen
signaling through the DDRs will enhance therapeutic response
in PDA. Furthermore, SPARC inhibition of DDR activation by
collagen provides a potential explanation for the observations
that SPARC expression correlates with chemoresponse in
patients with PDA (48).
How Ddr1 promotes tumor progression is unclear; although,
we identiﬁed that collagen-stimulated Ddr1 activation induces
signaling through Pyk2 and Peak1. Peak1, a recently described
kinase, has been implicated in invasion and tumor progression
in colon and PDA xenografts (30). Inhibition of Peak1 or Ddr1
activity is an attractive strategy to potentially reduce collagen
signaling in tumors. No Peak1 selective inhibitors have been
described, however, the number of DDR-selective small-molecular inhibitors is increasing (53, 54). Some of these inhibitors
including 3-(2-(Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-6-yl)-ethynyl) ben-

zamide 7rh (7-4104; ref. 53) have shown potent inhibition of
colony formation and anchorage-independent growth in
tumor cells in vitro and favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic
characteristics (53).
In summary, our ﬁndings demonstrate that collagen signaling enhances PDA, and suggest that VEGF-blockade can
promote tumorigenicity of a subset of PDA cells by promoting hypoxia-induced collagen production and stimulation of
Ddr1.
