BACKGROUND: Previous reports from these authors found that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
(PPARc) suppressed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study sought to identify the molecular target of PPARc and characterize
its antitumor effect in HCC. METHODS: Optimal PPARc binding activity was obtained using the PPARc agonist rosiglitazone (100 lM)
as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Under PPARc activation, 114 PPARc downstream targets associated with cancer development were identified by oligonucleotide microarray and Gene Ontology analysis. Among them, Cbp/p300-interacting
transactivator, with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain, 2 (CITED2) was the most prominent PPARc-bound target, as determined
by chromatin immunoprecipitation–polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: CITED2 messenger RNA and protein was significantly
down-regulated in primary HCCs compared with their adjacent nontumor tissues. PPARc induced expression of CITED2 in HCC cell
lines after adenovirus-PPARc transduction. The biological function of CITED2 was evaluated by loss- and gain-of-function assays.
CITED2 knockdown in the hepatocyte cell line LO2 and HCC cell line Hep3B significantly increased cell viability and clonogenicity,
and promoted G1-S phase transition in both cell lines. In contrast, ectopic expression of CITED2 in HepG2 and BEL7404 HCC cell lines
significantly suppressed cell growth. The tumor suppressive effect of CITED2 was associated with up-regulation of cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors p15INK4B, p21Wat1/Cip1, p27Kip1, antiproliferative regulator interferon alpha 1, proapoptotic mediators including tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A), TNFRSF25, caspase-8, granzyme A, and the tumor suppressor gene maspin. CITED2 was also associated with the down-regulation of cell cycle regulator cyclin D1, oncogene telomerase reverse
transcriptase, and proinvasion/metastasis gene matrix metallopeptidase 2. CONCLUSIONS: CITED2 is a direct effector of PPARc for

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide.1 Most patients with HCC
are diagnosed at advanced stages, when treatment options are very limited. The prognosis of HCC is poor with an
extremely high fatality rate (overall ratio of mortality to incidence of 0.93).2 Although HCC can be eradicated by surgery
at an early stage, there is a high incidence of recurrence following tumor resection.3 Therefore, it is crucial to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms underlying HCC for development of more specific and effective therapies.
The peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor gamma (PPARc) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, activation
of which mediates diverse biological processes including lipid metabolism, insulin sensitization, and anti-inflammation. It
also inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation of cancer cells.4,5 Recent evidence suggests that activation of PPARc
by agonists such as thiazolidinediones produces tumor suppressive effects in many human malignant cell types.6 We and
others previously showed that rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione-class drug, inhibited hepatocarcinogenesis in vitro and in
vivo by inducing cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.7-9 However, the PPARc regulatory network and its molecular targets
in liver cancer remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified the PPARc downstream targets relevant to carcinogenesis, by using oligonucleotide microarray and gene ontology analysis. Among the identified targets and consistent with the
major function of PPARc in HCC suppression,7-9 Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator, with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain, 2 (CITED2) was identified as a direct effector of PPARc in HCC cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). With the observation that CITED2 is significantly downregulated in primary HCCs compared with paired adjacent normal tissues, we further demonstrated the tumor
suppressive properties of CITED2 through gain- or loss-of-CITED2 function analyses, which are at least in part mediated

by the suppression of cell proliferation and inhibition of
cell cycle G1-to-S phase transition. Moreover, the molecular basis of CITED2 as a potential tumor suppressor in
HCC was also elucidated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human Liver Cell Culture

Human HCC cell lines (BEL7404, Hep3B, HepG2,
Huh7, PLC5, SKHep1, and SUN449) and a nontumorigenic hepatocyte cell line (LO2) were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco BRL, Rockville, Md) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco BRL).
PPARc Binding Activity Assay

To determine the optimal PPARc transcription factor
DNA binding activity in HCC cells, the PPARc agonist
rosiglitazone was used to stimulate PPARc/DNA binding
activity. Hep3B cells (80% confluent) were exposed to
100 lM rosiglitazone for various times (3, 8, 12, or 24
hours). The PPARc/DNA binding activity in nuclear
extract was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assay (Cayman Chemical,
Ann Arbor, Mich).
Oligonucleotide Microarray Procedure and Data
Analysis

Gene expression profiles of Hep3B cells with or without
rosiglitazone-induced PPARc/DNA binding activity were
analyzed using the Human Exonic Evidence-Based Oligonucleotide Chip (HEEBOChip) according to protocols
from the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility (http://
www.microarray.org). The DNA probe was prepared
from 50 lg of total RNA labeled with cyanine 5 deoxyuridine triphosphate (Cy5-dUTP; red) or Cy3-dUTP
(green) by reverse transcription (Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ). Two labeled complementary DNA
(cDNA) samples were competitively hybridized to the
microarray. A dye-swap microarray experiment was conducted in independent sample to exclude bias of dye label
factor. Signal intensities were analyzed using a GenePix
4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices,
Palo Alto, Calif). Gridding was performed using GenePix
Pro 5.0 (Axon Instruments), and array data were presented as the log base2 ratio of the Cy5/Cy3 signals.10
Gene expression patterns between treated samples and
controls were analyzed using unsupervised hierarchical
clustering. Statistically significant differences were
assessed by the t statistic using Significance Analysis of
Microarrays (SAM) software.11

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation

A ChIP assay was performed on Hep3B cells treated with
or without 100 lM rosiglitazone for 3 hours using the
Red ChIP Kit (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium). Immunoprecipitation was performed using 5 lg of PPARc antibody
(sc-7196; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif)
for each aliquot (300 lL). The immunoprecipitated
DNA was amplified with primers flanking the predicated
PPARc binding sites. The primer sequences are as follows:
CITED2 (forward: 50 -GCAAAAACGGAAGGACTG
GAA-30 , reverse: 50 -GCGCCGTAGTGTATGTGCT-30 ),
Kruppel-like factor 10 (KLF10) (forward: 50 -CCGGGAA
CACCTGATTTTCAT-30 , reverse: TACAGTAGATGG
CGCTGGTG-30 ), growth arrest and DNA-damage–
inducible protein 45 (GADD45A) (forward: 50 -GCCTG
TGAGTGAGTGCAGAA-30 , reverse: CCCCACCTTAT
CCATCCTTTC-30 ). The final PCR products were
resolved on 1% agarose gels by gel electrophoresis.
Adenovirus-Mediated PPARc Gene Transfer

Recombinant adenovirus encoding PPARc1 (Ad-PPARc)
and recombinant adenovirus encoding E. coli b-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) as a control were generously provided by
Dr. J. K. Reddy (Department of Pathology, Northwestern
University, the Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago,
Ill). Recombinant adenovirus of 75 multiplicities of infection (MOI) was transduced into Hep3B cell lines as
described.9
cDNA Synthesis, Quantitative PCR, and Reverse
Transcription PCR

Total RNA was extracted using RNA Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). The messenger RNA (mRNA)
expression level of CITED2 was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) or semiquantitative reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The primer sequences are
as follows: CITED2 (forward: 50 -GCAAAAACGGAAG
GACTGGAA-30 , reverse: 50 -GCGCCGTAGTGTAT
GTGCT-30 ).
Western Blot Analysis

Total protein was extracted and protein concentration
was measured by Bradford assay (DC protein assay; BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif). Protein lysate was
resolved by sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with antibodies to PPARc (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), p15INK4B, p21Wat1/Cip1, p27Kip1, cyclin
D1 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, Mass),
CITED2, or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (Abcam, Hong Kong, China).

Construction of CITED2 Expression Vector

The CITED2 expression vector was generated by PCR
cloning using the pcDNA3.1 TOPO TA Expression Kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). The CITED2 cDNA was
obtained by RT-PCR using normal human liver RNA as a
template (Ambion, Austin, Tex). The PCR products were
subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 TOPO vector, and clones
were screened and sequenced using vector-specific
primers.
Short Hairpin RNA Knockdown

The RNA interference experiment was performed using a
human short hairpin (shRNA) construct against CITED2
in a pGFP-V-RS vector (Origene, Rockville, Md). The
sh-CITED2 was 29-base oligomer as follows: 50 CTGTGCTAATAGTTATATTCAGTACATGA-30 . A
noneffective scrambled shRNA was used as control
(Origene).
Gene Transfection

Liver cell lines (LO2, Hep3B, HepG2, and BEL7404)
were transfected with expression vector or shRNA construct using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen), and were
treated with G418 (0.4 mg/mL) for selection of stably
transfected clones.
Cell Viability Assay

Cell viability was determined using CellTitre 96 aqueous
one solution cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison,
Wis).
Colony Formation Assay

LO2 and Hep3B (2  105 cells/well) cells were transfected with 2.5 lg sh-CITED2 or sh-scramble vector
using lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). Transfected cells
were selected with G418 (0.4 mg/mL; Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) for 2 weeks. Surviving colonies (with > 50 cells
per colony) were counted and analyzed after staining with
gentian violet. The experiment was performed in 3 independent triplicates.
Cell Cycle Analysis

Transiently transfected cells were trypsinized, washed in
phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in ice-cold 70%
ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline. DNA was labeled
with propidium iodide. Cell cycle distribution was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Data
acquisition and analysis were performed using the ModFitLT software (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, Calif).

considered to be of biological significance.
Statistical Analysis

Data were presented as mean  standard deviation (SD).
The paired t test was performed to compare the CITED2
expression level in paired human liver tumors and their
corresponding normal counterparts. The student t test
was applied to analyze the functional effect of CITED2
on cell viability, clonogenicity, and cell cycle progression.
All analyses were performed using SPSS software (version
13.0; SPSS, Chicago, Ill). Statistical significance was
accepted at the level of P < .05.
RESULTS
Rosiglitazone Induces PPARc/DNA Binding
Activity

To test the effect of rosiglitazone-mediated stimulation of
PPARc/DNA binding affinity in liver cancer, we treated
Hep3B cells with the PPARc agonist rosiglitazone (100
lM)12 for various time points. The results showed that
PPARc/DNA binding activity reached a maximal level after 3 hours of treatment, and remained elevated for at least
24 hours (Fig. 1A).
PPARc Activation Modulates Cancer-Associated
Genes and Networks

To identify novel PPARc downstream targets, gene
expression profiles of untreated and rosiglitazone-treated
Hep3B cells were analyzed using an oligonucleotide
microarray. Upon PPARc stimulation, a total of 573
genes were differentially expressed ( 4-fold changes),
wherein 244 genes were up-regulated and 329 genes were
down-regulated as identified by unsupervised hierarchical
clustering.
We further classified the PPARc-regulated gene candidates according to their biological functions by
GoMiner and Gene Ontology analysis. The results
showed that one-fifth (114 of 573) of the differentially
expressed candidates are involved in tumorigenesis with
functional roles in signal transduction (47.4%), cell cycle
control (16.9%), apoptosis (16.9%), cell proliferation
(11.7%), cell adhesion/metastasis (2.6%), and angiogenesis (4.5%). In addition, KEGG pathway analysis of these
cancer-associated genes revealed their involvement in the
P53 signaling pathway, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway, TGF-b (transforming
growth factor beta) signaling pathway, and extracellular

significantly induced binding of PPARc to the CITED2

selected for further functional investigation in HCC.

CITED2 Is a Novel Direct Target Gene of PPARc

Down-Regulation of CITED2 in Primary HCCs
and HCC Cell Lines

To further explore the key direct targets of PPARc among
the tumor-associated candidates, we performed computational prediction of PPARc binding sites of tumor-associated candidates using MatInspector. For each candidate
promoter sequence, locations approximately 2 kilobases
upstream of the transcription start site were analyzed. A
potential PPARc binding site was considered when both
matrix similarity and core similarity scored > 0.8. Incidentally, CITED2, GADD45A, and KLF10, transcriptionally activated upon PPARc stimulation (Fig. 1B),
were predicted to have the binding sites of PPARc in their
promoter regions (Fig. 1C). For validation of direct interaction, ChIP-PCR was performed on untreated and rosiglitazone-treated Hep3B cells, using primers flanking the
putative PPARc binding sites of CITED2, GADD45A,
and KLF10 (Fig. 1C). The results clearly demonstrate the

The mRNA expression level of CITED2 was determined
in a total of 30 paired liver tumor samples and 9 human
cell lines. As shown by qPCR, the CITED2 mRNA level
was significantly lower in tumors than in their adjacent
nontumor tissues (P < .0001, Fig. 2A). Protein level of
CITED2 was also detected in 10 paired HCC samples.
The CITED2 protein expression is significantly downregulated in HCC tumors compared with the adjacent
nontumor tissues (P < .05, Fig. 2B,C). Moreover, downregulation of CITED2 was observed in 7 HCC cell lines
including BEL7404, Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7, PLC5,
SKHep1, and SUN449 compared with that in normal
liver tissue (Fig. 2D). On the basis of their expression
level, we selected Hep3B, HepG2, and Huh7, which exhibit low CITED2 expression, for further validating the
interplay of PPARc and CITED2.

Knockdown of CITED2 Induces Cell Proliferation

To evaluate the effect of CITED2 on cell growth, we stably transfected sh-CITED2 into LO2 and Hep3B cells,
knockdown of CITED2 in these cells was evidenced by
western blot (Fig. 3A). CITED2 depletion caused a significant increase of colony formation in LO2 cells (increase
by 138%, P < .01) and in Hep3B cells (increase by 25%,
P < .05) (Fig. 3B,C). The effect of CITED2 knockdown
on promoting cell proliferation was further confirmed by
a significant increase of cell viability in CITED2-ablated
LO2 cells (P < .05) and Hep3B cells (P < .01) (Fig. 3D).
Knockdown of CITED2 Promotes Cell Cycle
Progression

We examined the contribution of cell cycle to the observed
growth induction of knockdown CITED2 in sh-CITED2
transfected cells (Fig. 4A). FACS analysis of sh-CITED2
transfected LO2 cells revealed a significant decrease in the
number of cells accumulating in G1 phase (66.5  1.6 versus 70.5  1.2, P < .01) compared to sh-scramble–
transfected LO2 cells (Fig. 4B,C). Concomitant with this
1222

inhibition, there was a significant increase in the number of
cells in S phase (25.2  0.7 versus 22.6  0.7, P < .01)
(Fig. 4C) under the same conditions. Induction of the G1S phase transition was further confirmed by analysis, using
western blot, of the key G1-S phase regulators. Knockdown
of CITED2 reduced the protein expression of negative cell
cycle regulators p15INK4B, p21Wat1/Cip1, and p27Kip1, but
enhanced the level of cyclin D1 which is an important regulator to facilitate G1-S phase transition (Fig. 4D,E).

interaction between PPARc and each of these effectors
was confirmed by ChIP-PCR analysis (Fig. 1). Among
these targets, CITED2 is the most significant novel
PPARc-bound gene. CITED2 has been reported to play
an essential role in liver development. CITED2-deficient
mice display fetal liver hypoplasia with increased cell apoptosis and disrupted cell-cell contact.14 CITED2 also
plays a major role in shear-induced down-regulation of
MMP-1 and MMP-13 via a TGF-b–dependent pathway.15 CITED2 knockdown increases the invasiveness of
colon cancer cell lines.16 We examined CITED2 mRNA
expression in paired primary HCC specimens and found
that CITED2 transcription was significantly reduced in
primary HCC tumors compared with their adjacent nontumor tissues, with the implication that CITED2 may
function as a tumor suppressor in liver cancer development. To better define the effect of CITED2 in liver carcinogenesis, we examined the functional consequences of
CITED2 knockdown and overexpression in the human
liver cell lines. Depletion of CITED2 dramatically
induced colony formation in both cell lines (Fig. 2). In
agreement with the promoted clonogenicity, knockdown
of CITED2 also caused an increase in cell viability
(Fig. 2). On the other hand, ectopic expression of CITED2
in the HCC cell lines HepG2 and BEL7404 significantly
suppressed the cell viability of both cell lines, confirming
the antiproliferative effect of CITED2 in HCC.
Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance of
CITED2 as a novel tumor suppressor in liver cancer.

To investigate the mechanism by which CITED2
regulates cell growth, we performed FACS; cell cycle distribution analysis revealed that knockdown of CITED2
significantly reduced the proportion of cells in G1 phase,
with a concomitant increase of cells in S phase, inferring
that knockdown of CITED2 promoted cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase. To explore the molecular mechanism underlying G1-S phase transition, we examined the
regulatory proteins that control the G1-S checkpoint in
cells. The increased G1-S phase transition by CITED2
knockdown was associated with down-regulation of
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15INK4B, p21Wat1/Cip1,
and p27Kip1, and up-regulation of cyclin D1 (Fig. 4D,E),
thereby promoting cell proliferation. Conversely, overexpression of CITED2 in HepG2 and BEL7404 cells
enhanced expression of p21Wat1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 (Fig. 5),
thus inhibiting cell proliferation. The role of p15INK4B,
p21Wat1/Cip1, p27Kip1, and cyclin D1 as major players in
G1 arrest has been well accepted.17 p21Wat1/Cip1 and
p27Kip1 are potent inhibitors of cyclin D/Cdk4 and cyclin
E/Cdk2 activities, p15INK4B is an important inhibitor of
cyclin D/CDK4/6 activity,17 whereas cyclin D1 protooncogene is an important regulator of G1-S phase progression and serves as a cell cycle regulatory switch in actively
proliferating cells.18 Thus, results from assays of the
loss- and gain-of-CITED2 function suggested that the
mechanism of CITED2-mediated cell cycle arrest is most
likely associated with deregulation of cell cycle regulators
in HCC.
To further elucidate the molecular basis of the antiHCC effect of CITED2, we conducted a cancer pathway
cDNA array. The data showed that the growth inhibition
by CITED2 in HCC was correlated with induction of the
antiproliferative regulator IFNA1, proapoptotic mediators including TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF25, CASP8, and
GZMA, and a tumor suppressor gene SERPINB5, but
caused inhibition of the oncogene TERT and proinvasion/metastasis genes MMP2 (Fig. 7). IFNA1 has been
shown to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.19
TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF25, and CASP8 have been
reported to be key extrinsic proapoptotic mediators.20
Therefore, CITED2 enhanced TNFRSF1A and
TNFRSF25 expression, which can cause cleavage of
downstream effector CASP8, resulting in apoptosis.21
GZMA plays a pivotal role as an apoptotic inducer to trigger cell senescence in hematopoietic malignancy.22,23
SERPINB5 is a tumor suppressor in human breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers.24-26 TERT is a direct target
of c-Myc, an oncogenic transcription factor, and functions as a potential oncogene.27 MMP2 has been well

documented to play an important role in promoting cancer invasion and metastasis.28-30 Taken together, the antiHCC effect of CITED2 is in part mediated through upregulation of IFNA1, TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF25, CASP8,
GZMA, and SERPINB5, and down-regulation of TERT
and MMP2, which in turn suppresses HCC cell growth
(Fig. 7).
In conclusion, we have applied an integrated
approach to identify for the first time the direct effectors
of PPARc, and CITED2 plays a critical role in HCC as a
novel tumor suppressor through regulating cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, which provides new
mechanistic insight into the antitumor effect of PPARc.
