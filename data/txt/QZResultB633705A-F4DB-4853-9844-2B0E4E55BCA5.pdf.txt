ABSTRACT:
The extreme aggressiveness of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has
been associated with blocked gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) and
the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). We examined whether disturbed GJIC is
responsible for a CSC phenotype in established and primary cancer cells and patient
tissue of PDA using interdisciplinary methods based in physiology, cell and molecular
biology, histology and epigenetics. Flux of fluorescent dyes and gemcitabine through
gap junctions (GJs) was intact in less aggressive cells but not in highly malignant
cells with morphological dysfunctional GJs. Among several connexins, only Cx43 was
expressed on the cell surface of less aggressive and GJIC-competent cells, whereas
Cx43 surface expression was absent in highly malignant, E-cadherin-negative and
GJIC-incompetent cells. The levels of total Cx43 protein and Cx43 phosphorylated at
Ser368 and Ser279/282 were high in normal tissue but low to absent in malignant
tissue. si-RNA-mediated inhibition of Cx43 expression in GJIC-competent cells
prevented GJIC and induced colony formation and the expression of stem cell-related
factors. The bioactive substance sulforaphane enhanced Cx43 and E-cadherin levels,
inhibited the CSC markers c-Met and CD133, improved the functional morphology of
GJs and enhanced GJIC. Sulforaphane altered the phosphorylation of several kinases
and their substrates and inhibition of GSK3, JNK and PKC prevented sulforaphaneinduced CX43 expression. The sulforaphane-mediated expression of Cx43 was not
correlated with enhanced Cx43 RNA expression, acetylated histone binding and Cx43
promoter de-methylation, suggesting that posttranslational phosphorylation is the
dominant regulatory mechanism. Together, the absence of Cx43 prevents GJIC and
enhances aggressiveness, whereas sulforaphane counteracts this process, and our
findings highlight dietary co-treatment as a viable treatment option for PDA.

INTRODUCTION

epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in the regulation
of Cx43 protein levels, because previous findings
demonstrated that the HDAC inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate
increased the expression of Cx43 in pancreatic cancer
cells and promoted the growth inhibition of xenograft
tumors [26]. Similarly, the hypermethylation of the Cx43
promoter was correlated with low Cx43 expression in
human gliomas and lung cancer [23, 27].
In the present study, we demonstrate that the degree
of CSC features and gemcitabine resistance directly
correlates with dysfunctional GJIC due to low or absent
Cx43 protein levels. Our results provide new mechanistic
insight into stem cell signaling and suggest a dietary
strategy consisting of sulforaphane-containing cruciferous
vegetables for the restoration of defective GJIC in
pancreatic cancer, which could promote re-sensitization
to current chemotherapeutics.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one
of the most aggressive malignancies and is typically
diagnosed in an advanced state [1]. Gemcitabine is the
standard therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer [2]
but neither gemcitabine nor the newer FOLFIRINOX
combination therapy do not directly target cancer stem cell
(CSC) pathways responsible for growth, metastasis, high
resistance toward current cancer therapeutics and relapse
[3-5].
The mustard oil sulforaphane, which is present in
high concentrations in broccoli and its sprouts [6], has
well-documented cancer preventive efficacy and was
recently shown to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs)
[7]. Our recent results demonstrated that sulforaphane
sensitizes pancreatic CSCs to chemotherapy by inhibiting
their self-renewal potential, apoptosis resistance and NFκB activity [8-11]. Based on several promising animal
and epidemiological studies, prospective clinical trials
with sulforaphane-enriched broccoli sprout extracts are
ongoing in the U.S. to examine the effect on atypical nevi,
bladder and prostate cancer [12], and a pilot study recently
began at our clinic to evaluate the effect of this nutritional
strategy on patients with advanced PDA.
The inhibition of gap junctional intercellular
communication (GJIC) may be involved in the autonomous
behavior of CSCs, because GJIC confers features absent
in stem cells, namely contact inhibition [13], apoptosis
sensitivity [14] and terminal differentiation [15]. Gap
junctions (GJs) are channels in the plasma membrane that
allow direct communication between cells by the passive
transport of small molecules and ions [16]. Gemcitabine
and other chemotherapeutics also diffuse from cell-tocell via GJs [17], and this so-called “bystander effect”
leads to a higher cellular concentration of cytotoxic
agents [18]. GJs are formed by a family of more than 20
different connexins, and altered connexin expression is
involved in carcinogenesis and therapy resistance [19].
The absence of GJs is a common feature of pluripotent
stem cells. However, cells derived from stem cells, e.g.,
progenitor cells, have functional GJs, suggesting that
GJIC develops during differentiation [20-22]. Recently,
in human spheroidal glioma cultures, reduced GJIC and
very low levels of Cx43 were identified as mediators
of self-renewal, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity by
influencing E-cadherin expression, a marker of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) [23]. The phosphorylation
of Cx43, the most ubiquitously expressed connexin, has
been implicated in the regulation of GJIC at several stages,
e.g., the export of the protein to the plasma membrane, the
formation and activity of GJs and connexin degradation
[24]. For example, the inactivation of ERK1/2 and p38
MAP kinases by sulforaphane has been suggested to
inhibit H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Cx43 and a
block of GJIC in rat normal liver cells [25]. In addition,

RESULTS
The loss of GJIC correlates with a CSC-like
phenotype and gemcitabine resistance.
To evaluate the relationship between GJIC and
therapy resistance, 3 established human PDA cell lines
with different levels of therapy sensitivity were treated
with 50, 100 or 3,000 nM gemcitabine and cell viability
was examined using the MTT assay 72 h after treatment.
At the lowest dose, cell viability was reduced from 100
% to 34, 82 and 95% in sensitive BxPc-3, the derived
gemcitabine-resistant subclone BxPc-3-GEM and
resistant AsPC-1 cells, respectively, with a comparable
response at higher gemcitabine concentrations (Fig.
1A). This result was confirmed by measuring apoptosis
with annexin staining and FACS analysis (Fig. 1A). The
gemcitabine resistance of the PDA cell lines correlated
with the amount of CSC features, such as p53 and K-ras
status, morphology, self-renewal potential, tumorigenicity,
and the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin (Table
S1). In the following experiments, these cells were used
as in vitro models for PDA with low (BxPc-3), median
(BxPc-3-GEM) and high (AsPC-1) CSC characteristics.
We microinjected the membrane-impermeable but GJpermeable fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow [30] and
documented diffusion of fluorescence to neighboring
cells by fluorescence microscopy and video recording.
For data analysis gray values of fluorescence intensity
were evaluated by image processing and the gray value
of the directly injected cell was set to 100% (Fig. 1B, C).
The gray values of direct neighboring cells in the first
row surrounding the injected cell were 50, 20 and 0%
in BxPc3, BxPc-3-GEM and AsPC-1 cells, respectively.
The staining of indirect neighbors located in the second
row was detectable in BxPc-3 cells only. This result is

reflected by the evaluation of the means of gray values
of all neighboring cells in each cell line, which was
highest in BxPc-3 cells (Fig. 1D). The blockade of GJs
with 18αGA was used as negative control and completely
prevented the diffusion of Lucifer Yellow in all cell
lines as expected (Fig. 1C, D). These observations were
strengthened by co-incubation studies with fluorescencelabeled cells followed by examination of the fluorescence

intensity in unlabeled target cells and by co-incubation of
gemcitabine-treated and -untreated cells and studying the
gemcitabine bystander effect (Fig. S1).
To evaluate whether the reduced expression of a
specific connexin is responsible for impaired GJIC, we
studied the expression patterns of the standard connexins
Cx32, 26, 36, 45 and 43 by Western blot analysis. While
Cx26, 32 and 36 levels were enhanced in BxPc-3-GEM
and AsPC-1 cells compared to BxPc-3 and non-malignant,
immortalized pancreatic ductal CRL-4023 cells, Cx43 and
45 levels were diminished in the more malignant cells,
with the strongest effects observed for Cx43 compared
to BxPc-3 and CRL-4023 cells (Fig. 2A). Because the
expression of connexins on the cell surface is essential for
GJ functionality, we evaluated the cell surface expression
by double immunofluorescence stainings for the cell
surface marker EpCAM combined with either Cx26,
32, 36, 43 or 45. In line with the Western blot results,
fluorescence microscopy revealed strong expression of
Cx43 on the cell surface of BxPc-3 cells; however, this
expression was diminished in BxPc-3-GEM and totally
absent in AsPC-1 cells (Fig. 2B). The staining patterns of
all other connexins were diffuse in all cell lines without
obvious cell surface expression (Fig. S2), which argues
against a major role in conferring functional GJs. In
addition, electron microscopy revealed the presence
of functional GJs in BxPc-3 cells, as closely apposed
membranes separated by a faint gap were visible (Fig.
2C). In contrast, gap-like structures between neighboring
AsPC-1 cells were characterized by constant spacing and
gaps filled with contrasting material. These gaps were too
wide for regular GJ arrays; therefore, our data suggest that

Figure 1: Loss of GJIC correlates with a CSCphenotype. (A) BxPc-3, BxPc-3-GEM and AsPC-1 human

PDA cells were treated with gemcitabine (GEM) at the indicated
concentrations. Seventy-two hours later, viability was measured
with the MTT assay and apoptosis by annexin staining followed
by FACS analysis. Specific apoptosis was calculated using
the formula 100× [(experimental apoptosis %) - spontaneous
apoptosis of CO (%)] / [100 - spontaneous apoptosis of CO
%]. (B) After microinjection of Lucifer Yellow the diffusion of
dye from the injected cell to neighboring cells was detected by
fluorescence microscopy and video recording in the presence or
absence of the gap junction blocker 18αGA (10 mM), which was
incubated for 30 min prior to the injection of Lucifer Yellow.

non-functional GJs are present in AsPC-1 cells, which is
most likely due to the absence of Cx43 on the cell surface.
In surgically resected human pancreas tissue we
found high levels of Cx43 phosphorylated at Ser 368 and at
Ser 279/282 in non-malignant pancreas tissue derived from
6 organ donors but not in malignant PDA tissue derived
from 6 patients (Fig. 3A, B). These data were confirmed in
additional PDA tissues derived from 3 patients, in which
total Cx43 was completely absent in the malignant parts of
the sections but present in the non-malignant parts of each
individual tissue (Fig. 4A). This correlated to expression
of E-cadherin, which was expressed in normal pancreas
tissue, but not in malignant pancreas tissue, as examined

by double immunofluorescence staining of total Cx43 and
E-Cadherin followed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.
4B).

The inhibition of Cx43 prevents GJIC and
promotes tumor aggressiveness.
To further elucidate the function of Cx43 for GJIC
and CSC features in pancreatic cancer, we knocked down
Cx43 in low-malignant BxPc-3 cells by Cx43-directed
siRNAs. Compared to the non-specific control siRNA, 2 of
5 tested specific siRNAs completely downregulated Cx43
protein expression at a concentration of 50 pmol, and the
strongest effects were observed 3 days after transfection,
as evaluated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A, Fig. S3).
For subsequent experiments, siRNA-transfected BxPc-3
cells were microinjected with Lucifer Yellow, followed
by video analysis of dye diffusion and analysis of gray
values. Compared to cells transfected with control siRNA,
the specific siRNA targeting Cx43 decreased the average
staining of the neighboring cells in the first cell row from
50 to 30% and in the second row from 20 to 15% (Fig.
5B). In parallel, the viability of Cx43 siRNA-transfected
BxPc-3 cells increased and the gemcitabine bystander
effect was completely abolished, as measured by the coincubation of gemcitabine-treated and non-treated cells
(Fig. 5C). Furthermore, the downregulation of Cx43
enhanced the colony-forming capacity (Fig. 5D) and led
to the induction of stem cell-associated factors including
Oct-3/4, Nanog, SOX2 and TP65 as well as the EMTrelated transcription factor Snail, as measured using an
antibody protein array (Fig. 5E).

Sulforaphane enhances Cx43 protein levels
and GJIC and changes Cx43 phosphorylation
patterns.

The expression and cellular localization of Cx43 (Cell Signaling)
was analyzed by double immunofluorescence staining using

In an attempt to enhance Cx43 expression to
restore GJIC and to inhibit CSC features, we performed
treatments with sulforaphane, and examined the
expression of Cx43 by Western blot analysis. Compared
to untreated control cells, sulforaphane strongly increased
the amount of total Cx43 in all cell lines examined (Fig.
6A). Basal Cx43 phosphorylated at Ser 368 was highest
in BxPc-3 cells. Sulforaphane led to a time-dependent
increase of the low basal levels of Cx43 phosphorylated
at Ser 368 already 2 h after treatment in BxPc-3-GEM and
AsPC-1 cells, whereas the high basal expression in BxPc3 cells was not further increased, but rater decreased.
Moreover, the expression of Cx43 phosphorylated at Ser
279/282 was increased by sulforaphane treatment in all
3 cell lines. Sulforaphane also induced the expression of
E-cadherin in all 3 cell lines, but stronger expression was
observed in the 2 more aggressive cell lines demonstrating
lower basal levels. To evaluate whether sulforaphane1624

mediated induction of Cx43 expression was accompanied
by enhanced GJIC, we microinjected Lucifer Yellow
into untreated or sulforaphane-treated BxPc-3-GEM
cells. Video analysis of dye diffusion and the analysis of
gray values revealed that sulforaphane increased GJIC
(Fig. 6B). The results of electron microscopy correlated
with these findings, as the contrasting material in gaplike structures between neighboring AsPC-1 cells was
diminished after sulforaphane treatment (Fig. 6C)
compared to untreated AsPC-1 cells (Fig. 2C). Finally,
inhibition of GSK3, PKC and JNK by the inhibitors BIO,
staurosporine and SP600125, respectively, diminished
the sulforaphane-induced expression of total Cx43 and
of Cx43 phosphorylated at Ser 368 as shown in AsPC-1
cells (Fig. 6D). This result, together with the finding that
sulforaphane influences the phosphorylation of numerous
kinases and their substrates in a time-dependent manner

(Fig. S4) suggests that postranslation phosphorylation is
involved in enhanced expression of Cx43. In contrast,
sulforaphane did not upregulate Cx43 mRNA expression,
as measured by qRT-PCR (Fig. S5); did not increase the
demethylation of the Cx43 promoter, as measured by
quantitative methylation analysis of the GJA1 (Cx43)
gene (Fig. S6); and did not enhance the binding of
acetylated histones to the GJA1 promoter as measured
by chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histones
3 and 4 followed by the analysis of several regions
surrounding the GJA1 transcription start site by qPCR
(Fig. S7). Remarkably, enhanced methylation of the Cx43
promoter in untreated AsPC-1 cells compared to BxPc3 and BxPc-3-GEM cells was detected (Fig. S6), which
may be responsible for the non-detectable expression
of Cx43 mRNA in AsPC-1 cells (Fig. S5). Therefore,
elevated Cx43 protein levels after sulforaphane were most
likely due to the altered phosphorylation and stabilization

were treated with non-specific siRNAs (siCO) or specific

expression of Cx43 was analyzed by Western blot on days 1, 2

in Fig. 3A. (B) BxPc-3 cells were treated with 50 pmol siRNA

at a ratio of 1:1 for 24 h. The viability of untreated cells (CO,

assay. (D) Three days after transfection with siCO or siCx43,

of Cx43 protein; although the phosphorylation pattern of
Cx43 varied between cell lines, which is in line with a
recent report [31].
To further highlight these findings in primary
CSC-marker-positive cells, we selected primary CSCs
by transplantation of freshly resected PDA tissue from
two patients to immunodeficient mice. For enrichment
of CSCs we subtransplanted the xenografts for several
rounds. During subtransplantation, the tumor morphology
and tumor stroma were largely preserved, as ensured
by Trichrome staining of the primary tumors and its
xenografts (Fig. 7A and data not shown), whereas the
latency and the tumor take rate increased (data not shown).
Accordingly, the CSC marker c-Met was enriched from
17% in the primary tumor to 32% in xenografts at passage
3. The expression of Cx43 phosphorylated at Ser 368 was
also detected in the primary tumor tissue and its xenografts;
however, quantitative evaluation was not possible due to
the expression of Cx43 between neighboring cells. To

examine the effect of sulforaphane on CSC features, we
further enriched CSC-marker positive cells from passage
7 xenografts of the 2 patient tumors by isolation of tumor
cells and in vitro spheroidal culture (Fig. 7B). This culture
technique favored the growth of CSCs, because the
ability to grow anchorage-independent is considered as a
property of CSCs, and this is reflected by the enhanced
expression of the CSC markers c-Met (~ 75%) and CD133
(~ 80%), as detected by the preparation of cytospins and
immunohistochemistry (Fig. 7C). Moreover, the treatment
of the spheroidal cultures with sulforaphane for 24 h
increased the expression level of Cx43 phosphorylated
at Ser 368, E-cadherin and active caspase 3, whereas
the levels of c-Met and CD133 decreased. These results
demonstrate that Cx43 expression is low in primary CSCs,
but can be increased by sulforaphane treatment, which is
associated with inhibition of CSC and EMT markers and
induction of apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
We examined GJIC in human pancreatic cells and
tissues and found a direct correlation among low Cx43
protein levels, blocked GJIC, gemcitabine resistance, CSC
features and EMT marker expression. In particular, less
malignant and GJIC-competent BxPc-3 cells expressed
Cx43 protein at a high level on the cell surface and
showed morphologically intact GJs; however, Cx43
was not expressed in highly malignant AsPC-1 cells
with blocked GJIC and morphologically non-functional
GJs. BxPc-3-GEM cells were intermediate malignant
subclones of BxPc-3 cells and exhibited weaker
expression of Cx43, which was primarily localized to the
cytoplasm rather than to the cell surface. These findings
suggest that cytoplasmic localization of Cx43 induces
the dysregulation of GJs by Cx43 withdrawal from the
cell membrane during early tumor progression (BxPc3-GEM), which may be followed by complete silencing
of Cx43 expression in later tumor stages (AsPC-1). In
this regard, changes in Cx43 expression and localization
during pancreatic cancer progression have been recently
described in the murine system and suggest a potential
role for GJs and Cx43 in mediating interactions between
and amongst the stromal and epithelial cells [32]. Another
suggested mechanism for Cx43 translocation from the
cell surface, along with the reduction of GJIC, involves
the hypophosphorylation of Cx43, as demonstrated
in oncogene-transformed rat liver epithelial cells and
the occurrence of phosphorylated (P1, P2 P2´, P3) and
unphosphorylated P0 Cx43 immunoreactive bands in
Western blot analysis [33]. This hypothesis corresponds
to our stainings of human pancreatic cancer tissues, in
which the high expression of Cx43 phosphorylated at Ser
368 and Ser 279/282 was detected in non-malignant tissue
only. The key phosphorylation events at different Cx43
serine residues responsible for regulating the GJ life cycle
are complex and differentially regulated between different
cell types and amino acid residues, and were therefore not
examined in detailed in the present report. However, the
underlying signaling pathways of Cx43 phosphorylation
appear to involve MAPK activity [31]. In this regard,
the activity of JNK, ERK and p38 MAP kinases and
the subsequent enhanced phosphorylation of Cx43 have
been shown to inhibit Cx43 protein expression [25, 34].
In our studies, the sulforaphane-mediated elevated levels
of Cx43 were prevented by inhibitors of GSK3, JNK and
PKC, which suggests the involvement of these kinases in
phosphorylation of Cx43, which may lead to enhanced
protein levels. This suggestion is underlined by our finding
that sulforaphane influenced the phosphorylation patterns
of several kinases and their substrates in a time-dependent
manner.
To demonstrate the strong impact of Cx43 on GJIC in
pancreatic cancer, we inhibited Cx43 expression by siRNA
transfection in GJIC-competent BxPc-3 cells, leading

to a completely abrogated GJIC, which was associated
with a higher basal viability, resistance to gemcitabine,
enhanced clonogenic potential and the induction of
stem cell-associated factors. This finding is supported
by observations made by Yu and colleagues [23], who
identified the expression of Cx43 in more differentiated
and GJIC-competent human glioma cells, while glioma
stem cells were GJIC-incompetent and Cx43 negative.
Hence, adenoviral reconstitution of Cx43 expression
in glioma stem cells inhibited their capacity for selfrenewal, invasiveness and tumorigenicity by influencing
E-cadherin expression [23]. As an underlying mechanism
for reduced Cx43 expression in glioma stem cells, these
previous authors suggested that hypermethylation of
the promoter of the GJ protein α1, which encodes Cx43
[23], may regulate this process. This hypothesis was
evaluated by measuring the immunoprecipitation of
methylated DNA (MeDIP) followed by PCR amplification
of 2 potentially methylated regions in the GJA1 (Cx43)
promoter. We confirmed this result in our system and
used quantitative EpiTYPER methylation profiling of the
region surrounding the Cx43 transcription start site. We
also detected enhanced Cx43 promoter methylation in
CSC-like AsPC-1 cells compared to the less malignant
BxPc-3 and BxPc-3-GEM cells. Thus, strongly enhanced
promoter methylation of Cx43 may be responsible for
the observed absent RNA and protein expression of
Cx43 in AsPC-1 cells. However, it remains unclear how
dysfunctional GJIC supports a CSC phenotype and tumor
progression. A reasonable explanation is that dysfunctional
GJIC prevents influences from surrounding normal tissue
cells [35], thereby enabling CSCs to escape growth control
mechanisms and apoptosis induction [20, 36].
We demonstrated that sulforaphane stimulated the
elevated expression of defective Cx43 in established
and primary models of pancreatic CSCs along with the
restoration of defective GJIC, the activation of E-cadherin
protein and the inhibition of the CSC markers CD133
and c-Met. A main underlying mechanism for these
observations may be postranscriptional phosphorylation,
because inhibition of GSK3, JNK and PCS inhibited
the sulforaphane-induced expression of Cx43 and
sulforaphane influenced the phosphorylation of several
kinases and their substrates. We did not observe an effect
of sulforaphane on Cx43 RNA expression, promoter
methylation or promoter binding of acetylated histones;
therefore, the epigenetic regulation of Cx43 expression by
sulforaphane may be excluded. However, our data do not
exclude the possibility that sulforaphane generally affects
epigenetic regulation, as demonstrated by our Western blot
experiments showing enhanced acetylation of histones
3 and 4 after sulforaphane treatment of PDA cells. In
addition, work by others has demonstrated the inhibition
of DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase by
sulforaphane [37, 38]. Our results also do not exclude the
involvement of histone acetylation in the basal regulation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of Cx43 expression in pancreatic cancer, which has been
suggested by a recent study showing that the HDAC
inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate increases Cx43 expression and
suppresses the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells
[26].
The present data demonstrate that reduced Cx43
protein levels are major mediators of blocked GJIC, which
confer a CSC-like phenotype in PDA. However, dietary
sulforaphane enhances Cx43 protein levels, restores
GJIC and inhibits CSC features; therefore, a diet rich in
cruciferous vegetables containing sulforaphane and related
mustard oils may be considered as a supportive nutritional
strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy in patients
suffering from pancreatic cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Established Cell Lines.
Established human BxPc-3 and AsPC-1 PDA cell
lines and immortalized CRL-4023 hTERT-HPNE human
PDA cells were obtained from ATCC. BxPc-3-GEM
subclones were selected from parental BxPc-3 cells
by continuous culturing in increasing concentrations
of gemcitabine up to 100 nM for several months. Cells
were cultured in DMEM (PAA, Pasching; Austria)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (SigmaAldrich, Steinheim; Germany) and 25 mmol/L HEPES
(PAA, Pasching; Austria). Cells were authenticated by a
commercial service (Multiplexion, Heidelberg, Germany).
Monthly tests ensured a mycoplasma-free cell culture.

Reagents.
A 126 mM gemcitabine solution (Eli Lilly,
Indianapolis, IN, USA) used for patients was diluted in
cell culture medium to a 100 µM stock solution. The
gap junction inhibitor 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (18GA;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; USA) [39] was diluted
in DMSO to a 70 mM stock. D,L-sulforaphane (>90%
pure, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim; Germany) was dissolved
to create a 50 mM stock solution in EtOH. 5-Aza-2’deoxycytidine (>97% pure, Sigma) was dissolved in acetic
acid:water (1:1) to create a 50 ng/ml stock solution. The
GSK-3 inhibitor BIO and the JNK-inhibitor SP600125
(Selleckchem.com, München, Germany) were dissolved
in DMSO to 10 mM stocks and the PKC-inhibitor
staurosporine (Selleckchem.com) was dissolved in DMSO
to a 1 mM stock. The final concentrations of the solvents
in medium were 0.1% or less.

Primary Antibodies.

medium. Lucifer Yellow dye (Sigma Aldrich, Germany)
was injected with a customized iontophoresis device for
90 s at a constant current of 10 nA. The distribution of
Lucifer Yellow was examined by fluorescence microscopy
(Zeiss, Oberkochen; Germany) in combination with a
CCD Kappa CF 15 DRE camera (Kappa GmbH, Gleichen,
Germany) and a video recorder, as recently described
[42]. Pictures were extracted from the videos between
the onset (t = 0 s) and the end of the injection (t = 100
s). The fluorescence signal was analyzed at 100 s by
calculating the gray values of the directly injected cell and
the 1st and 2nd cellular neighbors using customized image
data processing software (Histo 3.0, University Hospital
Heidelberg, Germany). The gray value of the directly
injected cells was set to 100%, and the gray value of the
10th neighboring cell was set to 0%. To block GJIC, the
cells were treated with 10 µM 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid
(18αGA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; USA) 30 min
prior to microinjection.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) were used
against Cx32, Cx26 (Invitrogen, Camarillo, California;
USA), c-Met, total Cx43 (#3512, Cell Signaling
Technology, Boston, MA, USA), Cx43 phosphorylated
at Ser 368 (#ab47368; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), Cx45
phosphorylated at Ser 279/282 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc. Heidelberg, Germany), Cx45, CD44 (GeneTex,
Irvine, California, USA), acetyl-Histone H3 and acetylHistone H4 (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany),
E-cadherin (Cell Signaling), Ki67 (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA) and the cleaved fragment of activated
human caspase-3 (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Mouse
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used against Cx36,
total Cx43 (which does not detect Cx43 phosphorylated
at Ser 368, #138300; Invitrogen, Camarillo, California;
USA), CD133 (Abcam), β-Actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA), EpCAM and the epithelial glycoprotein Egp34
(kindly provided by G. Moldenhauer and described [40]).
Another rabbit monoclonal antibody (mAb) was used
to detect Cx43 phosphorylated at Ser 368 (#GTX48551
(Gene Tex (Irvine, California, USA).

Electron Microscopy.
Cells were processed for electron microscopy
according to standard procedures. Briefly, the 3-step
fixation process included 1 h on ice in 2.5% glutaraldehyde
(EM-grade, Sigma) buffered to pH 7.2 with 40 mM Nacacodylate, 2.4 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl and 58 mM
sucrose, followed by 1 h on ice in 1% aqueous OsO4 and
overnight at 4°C in 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate. After
dehydration in graded steps of ethanol, the adherent
cells were flat-embedded in epoxy resin (Polysciences,
Eppelheim, Germany). Ultrathin sections parallel to
the substrate-plane were prepared at a 40-nm nominal
thickness, post-stained in Reynold’s lead citrate and
4% aqueous uranyl acetate and viewed with an EM900
transmission electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany) at 80 kV. Images were captured on image plates
at 16,000× primary magnification and were scanned with
a 15-µm step-size (Ditabis Micron, Pforzheim, Germany).

Primary Spheroidal Cells.
Surgical
non-diagnostic
specimens
were
mechanically minced, and 2×107 cells placed in Matrigel
were transplanted to the flanks of 6-week-old NMRI
(nu/nu) female mice. The tumor take rate was 60%, and
after the development of a tumor, the xenografts were
resected, minced and subtransplanted to new mice.
Subtransplantation was repeated until stably growing
xenograft lines after passage 3 were obtained. Pancreatic
cancer spheres were generated from 2 established
xenograft lines, as recently described [4, 41], and the
primary spheroidal cultures were used for experiments
between days 7 and 30 of culture. Patient material was
obtained under the approval of the ethical committee of the
University of Heidelberg after written informed consent
was obtained from patients. Diagnoses were established
by conventional clinical and histological criteria according
to the World Health Organization (WHO). All surgical
resections were indicated according to the principles and
practice of oncological therapy. Animal experiments were
also approved by the ethical committee.

Antibody Protein Array.
Nitrocellulose membranes, on which capture
antibodies were spotted, and reagents for detection
were obtained as a kit (Human pluripotent stem cell
antibody array, Human phospho-kinase array) from
R&D Systems(Wiesbaden, Germany). According to the
manufacturer’s instructions, protein extracts were prepared
and then incubated with the nitrocellulose membranes, and
specific protein binding was detected with biotinylated
secondary antibodies using streptavidin-HRP and
chemiluminescence detection reagents.

Microinjection of Lucifer Yellow.
The tip of an ultrathin self-made glass pipette was
positioned in the intracellular space of a single cell in a
subconfluent cell layer in 35-mm dishes. The position was
controlled by measuring the membrane potential via the
wire in the pipette and the ground electrode in the culture

Protein Isolation and Western Blot Analysis.

The Gemcitabine Bystander Effect.

Whole-cell extracts were prepared using a standard
protocol, and proteins were detected by Western blot
analysis using specific primary antibodies as described
above. Goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary
antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
(Santa Cruz, CA; USA) and Luminata Forte Western HRP
Substrate (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA; USA)
were used for detection.

Cells were cultured in T75 flasks at concentrations
of 4 to 6×106 cells per flask. Confluent cells were left
untreated or were treated with 3 µm gemcitabine for 24 h.
Treated cells were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with untreated
cells and were seeded in 6-well plates at a concentration
of 7×105 cells/ml. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were
trypsinized and seeded at a concentration of 4×104 cells/
ml. Next, at 24 or 72 h after co-cultivation, viability was
measured using the MTT assay. Untreated cells were used
as a control and set to 100%. To measure GJIC by flow
cytometry, untreated cells were stained with CellTracker
Red CMTPX (Invitrogen, Eugene, Oregon; USA), cocultured and subjected to annexin staining and FACS
analysis of gated CellTracker Red-labeled cells only.

MTT Assay.
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 4×103 cells/
well and treated with gemcitabine 24 h later. After an
additional 72 h, viability was determined using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay, as previously described [8].

Immunohistochemistry of Established Cell Lines.

Annexin Staining and FACS Analysis of
Apoptosis.

Immunofluorescence staining was performed in
established cell lines growing in chambers of the Nunc
Lab-Tek Chamber Slide system (Sigma-Aldrich).
According to a standard protocol, 95% EtOH served
as a fixative, and 0.2% Triton X-100 was used for
permeabilization [45]. Nuclei were stained with DAPI
(4,6-diamidino-2’-phenylindol, 1 µg/ml). The binding
of primary antibodies was detected using the following
secondary Abs: goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 IgG, goat
anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 IgG, goat anti-mouse Alexa
Fluor 594 IgG and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488
IgG (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA; USA). Omission of the
primary Ab served as a negative control. The signal was
detected using a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope
(Leica, Wetzlar; Germany). Images of representative fields
were captured using a SPOTTM FLEX 15.2 64 Mp shifting
pixel digital color camera (Diagnostic, Instruments, Inc.
USA) and analyzed with SPOT Basic/Advanced 4.6
software.

Apoptosis was detected by annexin staining and
flow cytometry as previously described [43] using a BD
LSR II flow cytometer and FACS Diva software (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA; USA). Specific apoptosis was
evaluated with the following formula: 100× [(experimental
apoptosis %) - (spontaneous apoptosis of CO %)] / [100 spontaneous apoptosis of CO %].

FACS Analysis of GJIC.
FACS analysis of GJIC was performed as recently
described [30]. In brief, 3×105 cells/well in a 6-well plate
were labeled for 30 min at 37°C with 3 µM Calcein-AM
(Acetoxymethyl ester; Merck, Darmstadt; Germany) or
5 µM CellTracker Red CMTPX (Invitrogen, Eugene,
Oregon; USA) diluted in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen).
Calcein-loaded donor cells were trypsinized and plated on
top of the CellTracker Red-stained acceptor cells at a ratio
of 1:10. After 6 h of co-incubation, cells were trypsinized,
and single- and double-fluorescent cells were evaluated by
FACS analysis.

Immunohistochemistry of Primary Tissue and
Primary Cells.
Frozen 6-µm tissue sections from normal and
malignant human pancreas tissue obtained from
healthy organ donors, patients with PDA, primary
mouse xenografts or spheroidal cultures cytospinned
to glass slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.
Peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.03% hydrogen
peroxide. Immunohistochemistry was performed using
EnVision+System-HRP (AEC)
(DakoCytomation,
Carpinteria, CA; USA). After staining with primary
antibodies, the signal was detected as described above
for the established cell lines. The omission of the primary
Abs was used as a negative control. Patient material was

Colony Forming Assay.
Three days after siRNA transfection, 1×103 BxPc3-GEM cells/well were seeded into 6-well tissue culture
plates (BD Falcon, San José, CA, USA), and colony
forming assays were performed as previously described
[44].
