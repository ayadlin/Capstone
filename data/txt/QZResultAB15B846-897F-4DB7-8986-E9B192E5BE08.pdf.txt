ABSTRACT
Polyglutamylation of antifolates catalyzed by folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase
(FPGS) is essential for their intracellular retention and cytotoxic activity. Hence, loss
of FPGS expression and/or function results in lack of antifolate polyglutamylation
and drug resistance. Members of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway are negative
regulators of hematopoiesis and deregulation of this pathway is considered a major
contributor to leukemogenesis. Here we show that FPGS gene expression is inversely
correlated with the binding of a Smad4/Ets-1 complex to exon12 of FPGS in both
acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and acute myeloid leukemia blast specimens. We
demonstrate that antifolate resistant leukemia cells harbor a heterozygous point
mutation in exon12 of FPGS which disrupts FPGS activity by abolishing ATP binding,
and alters the binding pattern of transcription factors to the genomic region of exon12.
This in turn results in the near complete silencing of the wild type allele leading to a
97% loss of FPGS activity. We show that exon12 is a novel intragenic transcriptional
regulator, endowed with the ability to drive transcription in vitro, and is occupied by
transcription factors and chromatin remodeling agents (e.g. Smad4/Ets-1, HP-1 and
Brg1) in vivo. These findings bear important implications for the rational overcoming
of antifolate resistance in leukemia.

INTRODUCTION

fold higher potency to their intracellular target enzyme [2].
Hence, FPGS plays a key role in intracellular retention and
antitumor activity of polyglutamatable antifolates [5]. The
accumulation of antifolate polyglutamates has been well
recognized as an important determinant in the treatment
outcome of cancer patients including acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) [6-8] and solid tumors including lung
cancer and osteosarcoma [9]. Although antifolates
including methotrexate (MTX) are a key component in
ALL chemotherapy, acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
was found to have intrinsic resistance to these important
antimetabolites. Comparison of leukemia blasts obtained
from AML patients at daignosis to those derived from
ALL patients demonstrates that AML blasts accumulate
significantly less long-chain MTX polyglutamates than
ALL blasts [10].
We have previously shown that loss of FPGS

Folates are essential vitamins which serve as
cofactors in a variety of key processes such as de
novo nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis
and DNA methylation [1, 2]. Antifolates are folate
antagonists rationally designed to inhibit key enzymes
in the folate metabolic pathway and thus disrupt DNA
replication [1]. Polyglutamatable antifolates undergo a
unique metabolic process known as polyglutamylation,
in which several glutamate residues are attached to the
γ-carboxyl of the glutamate moiety of the antifolate; this
metabolic conversion is catalyzed by the ATP-dependent
enzyme folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS).
Polyglutamylation renders antifolates polyanions which,
on the one hand, are no longer recognized by efflux
transporters [3, 4], and on the other hand, display ~100www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activity is a predominant mechanism underlying
resistance to polyglutamatable antifolates, where 11 out
of 14 antifolate-resistant human ALL sublines displayed
drug resistance based on impaired FPGS activity [11].
Thus far, three naturally occurring mutations have been
shown to underlie loss of FPGS function in leukemia
cells: C388F decreased the affinity of FPGS for glutamate
by 23-fold [11]. Additionally, C209R and G569C, each
identified in separate alleles of FPGS in a single antifolateresistant subline, resulted in ≤13% residual FPGS activity
compared to the wild type enzyme [12].
The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling
pathway has key roles in cell differentiation, apoptosis,
development and carcinogenesis [13]. The intracellular
effectors of TGF-β signaling are the Sma- and Madrelated (Smad) transcription factors (TFs). While Smad4
is constitutively expressed, it translocates to the nucleus
only when in complex with phosphorylated Smads, which
are activated by TGF-β (Smad2 and Smad3) or in response
to bone morphogenetic proteins (Smad1, Smad5 and
Smad8) [14]. In the nucleus, Smads bind directly to their
DNA-binding site as heterodimers or interact with various
coactivators/repressors [15-18]. TGF-β is considered
the most potent negative regulator of hematopoiesis and
induces cell cycle arrest in committed progenitors by
down-regulating cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and
c-myc [19] and is considered to have a negative impact
on cell proliferation primarily in the myeloid cell lineage
[19].
Here we show that Smad proteins are involved in the
selective silencing of the WT allele of FPGS by binding to
an intragenic regulatory element in exon12 of FPGS and
consequent recruitment of epigenetic modifiers. We further
demonstrate that FPGS gene expression is inversely
correlated with the binding of a Smad4/Ets-1 complex to
exon12 in both ALL cells and AML blast specimens.

polyglutamatable antifolate plevitrexed. We first screened
the entire FPGS coding region for inactivating mutations
by cDNA sequencing. Six heterozygous point mutations
were identified in these three antifolate-resistant sublines
and were mapped to each of the FPGS alleles, as detailed
in Table 1.
To explore the possible deleterious effect that these
mutations may have on the structure and/or catalytic
activity of FPGS, amino acid conservation analysis was
performed for the mutated residues by multiple-alignment
of the human FPGS (hFPGS) with FPGS from various
species ranging from bacteria to mammals (Table 1).
Moreover, to further assess the impact of the mutations
on protein structure and enzyme function, a 3D model
of the hFPGS was built based on the Lactobacillus casei
(L. casei) FPGS template, as detailed in Materials and
Methods (Figure 1A). The mutation identified in MTA
C-3 cells (i.e. G1088A leading to a R363Q substitution)
resulted in the replacement of an arginine residue, which
is absolutely conserved among all of species analyzed
here, by glutamine. In FPGS from L. casei, this arginine
residue was shown to form a hydrogen bond with ATP,

Missense point mutations are a predominant
mechanism underlying loss of FPGS activity,
leading to resistance to polyglutamatable
antifolates in leukemia cells

To explore the mechanisms underlying loss of FPGS
function in human T-ALL cells displaying resistance to
polyglutamylation-dependent antifolates, we studied
the previously described human leukemia antifolateresistant sublines MTAR1.5, MTA C-3 and ZD1694 C-9
[11]. These clonal sublines, which lost over 97% of
their cellular FPGS activity consequently displayed high
levels of resistance to the polyglutamylation-dependent
antifolate ZD1694 (>470-fold compared to parental
CCRF-CEM cells), while retaining sensitivity to the nonwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

diagram of the full hFPGS model, created based upon the crystal
structure of the L.casei FPGS, with an emphasis on the position
of the mutations identified in the current study (marked with
red circles). The full side chain of the highlighted residues is
presented and colored by element. The mutated amino acids are
labeled by red circles and designated as follows: 1. R363, 2.

denoted by light blue. A close-up view at the putative interaction
of R363 (B) and Q363 (C) with ATP (marked by an arrow) is

thus stabilizing it in its binding pocket [20]. Analysis of
the R363Q substitution in the 3D model illustrates that
while the distance between the native arginine residue
and the ATP is compatible with hydrogen bond formation
(i.e. 2.6Å, Figure 1B), the mutant glutamine residue faces
in the opposite direction, causing a clash with the ATP
molecule (Figure 1C). MTAR1.5 cells harbor 2 mutations;
the first, R356P, affects a non-conserved residue. However,
the substitution of the arginine, located in an α-helix at the
surface of the protein, with a proline is likely to introduce
a bend and thereby have a deleterious effect on protein
structure (Figure 1A). The second mutation, A379T,
affects a highly conserved small non-polar residue (100%
alanine/glycine conservation) which is located at the
ATP-binding pocket (Figure 1A). The substitution of an
alanine with a polar threonine may cause the formation
of a new hydrogen bond or the disruption of hydrophobic
interactions, thereby altering protein structure. ZD1694
C-9 cells harbor three mutations; the V217M substitution
naturally exists in many species, therefore the substitution
of valine with a methionine is not expected to have a
deleterious effect on protein structure/function. The allele
harboring the V217M mutation harbors an additional
E287K substitution that affects a conserved negatively
charged residue (80% aspartate/glutamate conservation).
However, this residue is located at the protein surface
hence the E287K mutation may not affect protein structure
or catalytic activity (Figure 1A). The second FPGS allele
in ZD1694 C-9 cells harbors an A562S substitution which
cannot be evaluated by bioinformatics tools since it resides
in the C-terminus of the hFPGS - a domain only shared by
mammals.
While both MTAR1.5 and ZD1694 C-9 sublines
harbor missense mutations in both FPGS alleles, MTA C-3
cells harbor only a single heterozygous mutation (Table
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

1) and it was therefore surprising that these antifolateresistant cells have lost >97% of their cellular FPGS
activity. We thus investigated the molecular mechanism
underlying the near complete loss of FPGS function in
these drug-resistant cells.

The wild-type FPGS allele is selectively silenced in
MTA C-3 cells while the expression of the mutant
(G1088A) allele is fully retained
The cDNA sequencing trace of exon12 in MTA
C-3 cells revealed a markedly higher representation
of the mutant A1088 allele over the WT G1088 allele,
represented by the height of the nucleotide peak which
could not be detected in parental CCRF-CEM cells (Fig
2A). To corroborate this finding, relative allele expression
was determined by TA-cloning of a cDNA PCR product
spanning a region containing the G1088A mutation,
followed by sequencing of individual cDNA clones.
This analysis of multiple FPGS cDNA clones revealed
that the WT allele constitutes only 10% of all FPGS
transcripts (n=60), whereas the remaining 90% of FPGS
transcripts harbored the G1088A mutation (Fig. 2B). To
assess whether the WT allele is silenced or, alternatively,
the mutant allele is overexpressed, we quantified their
expression by real-time PCR using allele-specific primers,
designed to diagnostically discern between the WT and
mutant FPGS alleles. The expression levels of the WT
and mutant alleles in MTA C-3 cells were compared to
the expression of the WT allele in parental CCRF-CEM
cells (transcribed from both alleles of the FPGS gene) by
real-time PCR analysis. If both the WT and mutant alleles
in MTA C-3 are fully transcribed, each allele should
yield 50% of the expression of FPGS in CCRF-CEM;

into the first exon [21]. We therefore sequenced a 300bp
DNA fragment upstream to the first methionine, the entire
exon1 as well as the entire 3’-UTR; we found that the
MP of FPGS was free of mutations, whereas the 3’-UTR
contained the single nucleotide polymorphism ss1509426
(T1956C) in both parental and MTA C-3 cells. Thus, no
sequence alterations in these regulatory elements could
account for the differences in the expression of the WT
and mutant FPGS alleles in MTA C-3 cells.

this analysis revealed that while the mutant allele is fully
transcribed (46±2%, Fig. 2C), the WT allele is completely
silenced (1.1±0.2%, Fig. 2C). Selective silencing of the
WT allele should result in a 50% decrease in total FPGS
mRNA levels, therefore we determined FPGS expression
in MTA C-3 cells compared to their parental counterpart;
indeed, total FPGS mRNA levels in MTA C-3 cells were
reduced by ~40% (Figure 2D). These results establish that
the WT FPGS allele is exclusively silenced in MTA C-3
cells.
Alterations in the expression levels or posttranslational modifications of trans-acting elements could
not account for this differential allele-specific silencing
since they should equally affect the WT and mutant FPGS
alleles. Hence, to explore the mechanism underlying
differential FPGS allele expression in MTA C-3 cells, we
first searched for sequence alterations in transcriptional
and post-transcriptional cis-regulatory elements (i.e.
promoter and 3’-UTR). In this respect, Freemantle and
Moran previously showed that the minimal promoter (MP)
of FPGS resides 43bp upstream to the first methionine of
the mitochondrial leader sequence and extends 150bp

Exon12 of FPGS has transcriptional regulatory
capability
Recently it was shown that treatment of
cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors such as
suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA) increases the
intracellular accumulation of long-chain MTX
polyglutamates [22]. Hence, we postulated that epigenetic
alterations, including DNA methylation and repressive
histone modifications, may possibly account for the
selective silencing of the WT allele in MTA C-3 cells.

To explore this hypothesis, we screened the FPGS gene
for CpG islands and found two such elements: one
encompassing the promoter region (Figure 3A) and
another spanning the entire surroundings of exon12
(Figure 3B). To explore whether or not allele-specific
methylation in the FPGS promoter or exon12 can account
for the selective silencing of the WT allele in MTA C-3
cells, the methylation status of these regions was assessed
by bisulfite sequencing analysis. We found that the
promoter of FPGS is completely unmethylated (Figure
3C), whereas heavy methylation was found from intron
11 throughout exon12 in both the WT and mutant alleles in
MTA C-3 and CCRF-CEM cells (Figure 3D). The G1088A
mutation, found within the CpG island, disrupts a CpG
dinucleotide, hence enabling us to verify that both alleles
were represented during the cloning and sequencing in
the bisulfite sequencing analysis of exon12 (Figure 3D).
We confirmed that this methylation is not limited to cell
lines by determining the methylation status of exon12 in
leukemic cells from an adult AML patient and white blood
cells from a healthy individual. Indeed, exon12 was found
to be methylated in human cells as well (Figure 3D).
Recent studies have shown that not only promoters
but also intragenic and intergenic regions are widely
modulated during various physiological processes and
diseases. In particular, it is becoming increasingly clear
that DNA methylation in the gene body is not just a
passive witness of gene transcription but it appears to be
actively involved in multiple gene regulation processes
[23]. Moreover, intragenic CpG island methylation
was recently shown to mark transcriptional regulatory
elements, especially when the CpG island is evolutionarily
conserved [24]. Therefore, we performed an alignment of
the hFPGS with various FPGS proteins from different
mammals to assess which exons are homologous to human
exon12, and then determined the presence of a putative
CpG island in the genomic region of these homologues. A
putative CpG island (highlighted by a dark black line) was

found to encompass the exons that are homologous to the
human exon12 among various mammals including cattle,
dog, common marmoset, rabbit, tree-shrew and rhinoceros
(Figure 3E).
Given that our results suggest a transcriptional
regulatory role for exon12 of FPGS, we determined
the ability of the WT and mutant exon12 to initiate and
actively drive transcription of a luciferase reporter gene.
The sequences of the WT and mutant exon12 were cloned
and served as the promoters of the luciferase reporter
gene and luciferase expression driven by these exons was
compared to: 1) a random 150bp fragment from FPGS
intron 14, 2) a luciferase vector lacking a promoter (i.e.
pGL3-basic) as well as 3) an SV-40 promoter. The WT
and mutant exon12 displayed as much as 24% of the
promoter activity of the SV-40 promoter, whereas the
150bp fragment from intron14 of FPGS had no promoter
activity, being comparable to the promoterless vector (Fig.
4).

The WT allele of FPGS is selectively bound by
transcription factors and epigenetic modifying
agents at the exon12 region
The sole difference we observed between the WT
and the mutant R363Q allele in MTA C-3 cells was the
G1088A mutation, which resides in exon12. This exon
can effectively drive gene transcription (Figure 4), hence
we hypothesized that the cis/trans-regulatory elements
responsible for differential allele expression reside within
exon12. We thus analyzed by bioinformatics the mutation
region for the loss or de novo formation of binding sites
for TFs. This analysis revealed that WT exon12 harbors
binding sites for both avian erythroblastosis virus E26
(v-ets) oncogene homolog-1 (Ets-1) (EBS, Figure 5A)
and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) (GC-box, Figure 5A). In
contrast, whereas these binding sites are disrupted by the

Figure 4: Luciferase reporter gene assay. The promoter activity of the WT and mutant exon12 of FPGS was determined by luciferase
reporter gene analysis, and was compared to the activity of the SV-40 promoter, the luciferase vector without a promoter (Basic) or to a
150bp DNA fragment from intron14 of FPGS. Results shown are the ratio of the Luciferase to Renilla readings, and are the means of three
independent experiments performed in duplicates ± S.D.

mutation, a known consensus sequence for the binding of
TFs of the Smad family is newly formed (SBE, Figure
5A). Therefore, we determined the actual binding of Ets1, Sp1, Smad2 and Smad4 (Smad 3 is not expressed in
these cells and thus was not used) to the WT and mutant
alleles by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis,
followed by allele specific real-time PCR. Expectedly, this
ChIP analysis revealed that Ets-1 and Sp1 bind to the WT
allele 15- and 20-fold over the mutant allele, respectively
(representing 1.4 and 1.9% of the input, respectively; Fig.
5B). Furthermore, Smad4, which is known to interact with
Ets-1 [15], was also found to differentially bind the WT
allele (4-fold over the mutant allele, representing 2.1% of
the input in the WT allele), whereas Smad2 was found to
bind both alleles equally (Figure 5B). Smad proteins were
previously shown to be important factors in promoting
and maintaining epigenetic gene silencing [18, 25, 26] and
have also been suggested to be involved in the recruitment
of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP-1), a known marker of
gene repression, by promoting histone H3K9 methylation
[18]. Therefore, we further determined, by ChIP analysis,
the binding of the following epigenetic markers of gene
silencing to exon12 of FPGS: 1) Brahma-related gene
1 (Brg-1) as a marker of the nucleosome positioning
complex SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/
SNF) in addition to histone H3 and histone H3K9me2
modification as markers of high nucleosome density and
repressive histone modifications; 2) HP-1α as a marker
of heterochromatin and gene repression; and 3) RNA
polymerase II (PolII), as a marker of RNA polymerase
stalling/pausing due to high nucleosome abundance [27,
28]. Indeed, Brg-1, HP-1α, and PolII exhibited >25-fold
higher abundance on the WT allele compared to the
mutant allele, and H3 had a >7-fold higher abundance
on the WT allele (Figure 5B). Moreover, at the WT allele
we found H3K9me2 to constitute 54% of the detected
histone H3, whereas at the mutant allele only 14% of the
detected histone H3 was found to harbor this epigenetic
modification. The αA-crystallin (CRYAA) promoter is
known to be methylated in most cells [29]; we hence
used the CRYAA gene as a negative control for protein
occupancy in our ChIP experiments. Protein binding to
the mutant allele of FPGS in MTA C-3 cells resembled the
binding to CRYAA (i.e. residual ~0.1%), with the exception
of Smad2 and Smad4, which bind the mutant allele 9-16
fold over CRYAA (Figure 5B).
Exon12 is ~7kb downstream to the FPGS promoter,
suggesting that it may affect allele expression by DNA
looping with the MP of FPGS. We hence expected to find
in the promoter the same binding of the TFs and epigenetic
modifiers which were found in the WT FPGS allele,
although most do not have a binding site in the promoter
sequence. While exon12 of FPGS was highly occupied
by TFs, the MP of FPGS had 7-20 fold lower binding of
these proteins to give a maximum input percentage of
0.27 (Figure 5C). Since the MP did not exhibit substantial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

protein binding as would be expected from a promoter,
we searched for additional regulatory elements. In this
respect, Leclerc et al (2006) showed that a crucial FPGS
promoter element resides ~2500bp upstream of the
first methionine in CCRF-CEM cells [30]. Therefore,
the binding of these proteins to the upstream promoter
element (UPE) was evaluated by ChIP analysis. Indeed,
the same binding pattern was detected in this promoter
region compared to the binding to exon12, with higher
occupancy than in the MP (Figure 5C). In contrast to MTA
C-3 cells, CCRF-CEM cells fully express the FPGS gene.
We therefore further postulated that the binding of TFs to
exon12 in CCRF-CEM cells should resemble the binding
to the mutant exon12, with the exception of Smad2/4.
ChIP analysis confirmed that there is only residual protein
binding at exon12 of FPGS in CCRF-CEM cells (signal to
noise ratio ≤1, Fig. 5D). Consistently, the binding of these
proteins to the MP of FPGS or to the UPE in CCRF-CEM
was also undetected (<1.5-fold over background, Fig. 5EF).
To explore the clinical relevance of our findings,
which suggested that the expression of FPGS is repressed
by a Smad4/Ets-1 complex, we studied the binding of
these TFs to exon12 of FPGS in blast cells from AML
patients. We first determined FPGS expression in white
blood cells from adult AML patients at diagnosis (N=9)
compared to healthy volunteers (N=7). We found that
most of the AML patient blast specimens (N=7) expressed
increased FPGS mRNA levels (≥200% relative to healthy
controls), whereas 2 patient specimens, designated
AML1 and AML2, displayed substantially low levels of
FPGS (i.e. 40% and 25% of control FPGS expression,
respectively) (Table 2). We therefore performed ChIP
analysis to determine the actual binding of H3, Smad4
and Ets-1 to exon12 of FPGS in AML1 and AML2
patient specimens, compared to an AML3 patient sample
which expressed high levels of FPGS (208% of healthy
controls). Strikingly, leukemic blast cells from both
AML1 and AML2 patient specimens exhibited extremely
high abundance of Smad4 at the genomic region of FPGS
exon12, representing 71% and 4.8% of the input, with a
signal to noise ratio of 394 and 38, respectively (Figure
5G). This was in sharp contrast to the binding of Smad4
to exon12 in AML3 patient specimen, which displayed
only a negligible binding representing 0.8% of the input
with a signal to noise ratio of 1. The binding of Smad4 in
AML1 and AML2 patient blasts was accompanied with
Ets-1, though to a lesser extent, representing 4.3% and
1.7% of the input, respectively, with a signal to noise ratio
of 16 and 2.7 (Figure 5G). Consistently, the signal to noise
ratio of the binding of Ets-1 to exon12 in AML3 patient
specimen was 1. In addition, the binding of Smad4/Ets1 was highly correlated with the presence of H3 in the
region of exon12 in AML1 patient specimen with a signal
to noise ratio of 350 (Figure 5G).

DISCUSSION

the actual binding of TFs to exon12 or to the MP of
FPGS. The consensus site for Smads is present only in
the mutant FPGS allele, which could explain the binding
of Smad2 and Smad4 to the mutant allele in MTA C-3
cells demonstrated by ChIP analysis. However, we found
that Smad2 and Smad4 bind the WT FPGS as well. Smads
were shown to have low binding affinity to DNA, thus
requiring additional cofactors for DNA binding [15], and
are known to interact with Sp1 [17] and Ets-1 [15]. Indeed,
the latter TFs were selectively bound to the WT allele,
thus providing a plausible explanation for the preferential
binding of Smad4 to the WT allele over the mutant allele.
Additionally, genome-wide analysis of Smads binding
established that Smad4 is found in regions distant from
the transcription start site and in GC-rich motifs [34], both
of which are characteristics of the exon12 region of FPGS.
In the current study we found that Smad4 can
bind the WT FPGS allele in vivo and recruit epigenetic
modifying proteins, leading to the near complete silencing
of the WT FPGS allele. We further demonstrate the
binding of Smad4 and Ets-1 to the genomic region of
exon12 of FPGS in AML patient blasts exhibiting low
FPGS expression, while no such binding was detected in
an AML patient specimen with high FPGS levels. Thus,
the current study establishes Smads as novel negative
regulators of FPGS gene expression. This implies that a
combination regimen consisting of both antifolates along
with TGF-β inhibitors in the treatment of leukemia may
have a substantial synergistic therapeutic impact on patient
outcome. Consistently, the TGF-β signaling pathway has
been successfully targeted in hepatocellular carcinoma
cells and triple-negative breast cancer cells with a small
molecular inhibitor (LY2157299) or with a humanized
neutralizing antibody against TGF-β receptor type II
[35, 36]. Such targeted combination chemotherapy may
improve the treatment efficacy of both ALL and AML
via two approaches: 1) ALL patients could be tested for
Smad4-binding to exon12 of FPGS at diagnosis and/or
upon relapse, thereby allowing clinicians to personalize
the treatment protocol for individual ALL patients. 2) It

In the current study we explored the molecular
mechanism underlying antifolate resistance in leukemia
cells harboring a heterozygous G1088A mutation in
FPGS. We found that the WT FPGS allele was selectively
silenced presumably due to the binding of Smad4 to the
genomic region of WT exon12. We further show that
FPGS expression is inversely correlated with the binding
of Smad4 to exon12 in leukemic blast cells from adult
AML patient specimens.
Our search for the mechanism underlying the
selective silencing of the WT allele of FPGS in MTA-C3
cells led us to discover a heavily methylated CpG island
in the region encompassing intron 11 through exon12 of
the FPGS gene in human leukemia cell lines and in human
peripheral white blood cell samples (i.e. healthy donor
and an AML patient). In addition, bioinformatics analysis
revealed that exon12 harbors a putative GC-box sequence,
which we found to be occupied by the TF Sp1 (17-fold
over the negative control) upon ChIP analysis. Although
the functional role of intragenic binding of TFs has not
been extensively reported, Sp1 and Smads were previously
shown to regulate transcription via intragenic binding
sites [31, 32]. These findings suggested that exon12 of
FPGS has a transcriptional regulatory role. A careful
examination of the UCSC database revealed several points
to support our hypothesis that exon12 acts as a regulator
of FPGS transcription: 1) Exon12 emerges upon DNaseI
hypersensitivity assays along with the MP of FPGS;
indeed, DNase I hypersensitivity is an established feature
of regulatory elements [33]. 2) Histone modifications
which are characteristic of promoter/enhancer elements
including H3K4me3 and H3K4ac are observed in exon12
in various tumor cell lines. 3) A high occupancy of TFs in
exon12 was reported in ChIP-seq experiments compared
to other regions of the FPGS gene.
In this respect, since our findings indicate that
exon12 may play an important role in regulating FPGS
gene expression, we performed ChIP analysis to confirm

may enable the inclusion of antifolates in the treatment of
AML, a hematological malignancy which is known to be
inherently resistant to antifolate treatment due to low levels
of FPGS activity [10]. FPGS is crucial for the maintenance
of the intracellular folate pool, which is critical for de novo
nucleotide biosynthesis and DNA replication [1], thus it is
not surprising that we found FPGS to be overexpressed in
most of the specimens from adult AML patients (7 out of
9 patients studied). This is in concordance with previous
reports in which FPGS was found to be overexpressed
in many hematopoietic malignancies, and to a lower
extent in normal bone marrow [37]. From a physiological
perspective, we propose that part of the TGF-β response,
which induces cell cycle arrest in hematopoietic cells,
leads to silencing of FPGS expression via binding of
Ets-1, Smad2 and Smad4 to exon12 of FPGS, thereby
resulting in reduced intracellular nucleotide pools.
DNA-looping between distant regulatory elements
within the ORF and the promoter is known to contribute
to transcriptional regulation [38], hence, exon12 of FPGS
may interact with the promoter, with the cooperation of
the highly bound Smad4/Ets-1 complex. This Smad4/
Ets-1 complex can also promote allele-specific silencing
by recruiting epigenetic modifiers. However, whereas
these TFs highly bind exon12, they were found at a
much lesser extent in the MP (~2% of input in exon12
compared to ~0.3% of input in the MP). The promoter of
FPGS was previously explored in CCRF-CEM leukemia
cells by Leclerc et al, with constructs harboring promoter
segments up to 8kb upstream of the transcriptional
start site, revealing an 800bp domain located ~2.5kb
upstream of the transcription start site with an important
regulatory role [30]. We thus evaluated Ets-1, Smad2
and Smad4 occupancy in this upstream region, and
indeed found a significant abundance of these TFs in the
UPE. Bioinformatics analysis identified binding sites
for these factors in the UPE, allowing for this genomic
region to interact with exon12 by cross-talk between the
same TFs. This is further substantiated by the fact that
in CCRF-CEM parental cells Ets-1 and Smads do not
bind to exon12 and accordingly, the MP and UPE are
also devoid of these proteins. The putative interaction
of exon12 with the promoter presumably directs the
epigenetic modifiers to allow specific allele silencing.
The SWI/SNF complex can either promote transcription
by nucleosome removal or suppress transcription by
nucleosome positioning, depending on the interacting
protein partners (reviewed by Narlikar et al, 2002 [39]).
This complex was shown to interact with methyl CpG
binding proteins to repress gene expression [40] and since
exon12 is highly methylated, it may recruit the transacting factors necessary for transcriptional repression.
High nucleosome density impairs the unwinding of the
two DNA strands during transcription and was shown
to induce PolII stalling as well as pausing [27, 28]. We
consistently found here 50-fold higher levels of PolII
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

occupancy on the WT allele, when compared to the
mutant allele. Another support to the epigenetic silencing
of the WT allele is that the sequences of both WT and
mutant alleles had the same promoter activities in driving
luciferase reporter transcription. Since luciferase reporter
analysis is performed using a vector transiently introduced
into the cells, nucleosomes cannot be recruited and cannot
influence gene expression. Therefore, if indeed epigenetic
modifications are the mechanism underlying silencing of
the WT allele, no differences in luciferase reporter activity
are expected between the WT and mutant alleles.
In this study we also demonstrate that inactivating
FPGS mutations constitute a dominant mechanism of
antifolate resistance in leukemia cells, illustrated by the
fact that all antifolate-resistant cells that were examined
harbored inactivating mutations in the ORF of FPGS.
We have previously shown (Liani et al., 2003) that loss
of FPGS activity is a dominant mechanism of resistance
to polyglutamatable-antifolates in leukemia cells and
our conclusion was that inactivating mutations are not a
common mechanism of loss of FPGS function in antifolate
resistance [11]. However, the screening for inactivating
mutations at that time was performed by the single-strand
conformational polymorphism (SSCP) method, which
is based on conformational changes induced by singlebase mutations. Clearly, since various mutations may
not necessarily introduce a conformational change in
the DNA fragment under study, this SSCP method is not
sufficiently sensitive as the direct sequencing method in
detecting mutations. Hence, we were now able to detect
multiple single nucleotide substitutions in the FPGS gene
in various antifolate resistant leukemia sublines. In this
respect, we identified a total of six missense mutations
in the coding region of FPGS, which further expand the
list of hFPGS mutations including three other missense
mutations previously reported to result in the loss of FPGS
activity in antifolate resistant cells [11, 12]. Two of the
mutations that we identified here, in two independent
antifolate-resistant sublines, affected the ATP-binding
pocket of FPGS. The R363Q substitution found in MTA
C-3 cells is predicted to impair ATP-binding by interfering
with an important hydrogen bond formed between the
conserved arginine residue at position 363 and ATP.
The A379T substitution found in MTAR1.5 cells resides
at close vicinity to the ATP-binding pocket and may
disrupt substrate entry or release from this pocket. The
A562S substitution, found in MTAR1.5 cells, could not be
analyzed using bioinformatics tools. However, substitution
of the G569 residue located near the A562 residue, with
a cysteine, resulted in the loss of 87% of FPGS activity
in antifolate resistant human leukemia cells [12], strongly
indicating that this region is highly important for FPGS
activity. Polymorphisms affecting FPGS protein activity
have recently been reported in the general population,
suggesting different antifolate sensitivities in patients
undergoing antifolate-containing chemotherapy [41].

Since we used single-step selection to isolate two of the
antifolate resistant clonal sublines, the mutations that we
identified were most likely preexisting variants rather than
newly induced by the exposure to antifolates. Therefore,
we suggest that in addition to the variations in FPGS
activity between patients, the tumor itself, in a single
patient, is composed of multiple genomically unstable
cells which may display distinct sensitivities to antifolates
due to high frequency of alterations in the coding sequence
of the FPGS gene. Some of these cells can survive the
chemotherapeutic treatment and can result in a relapse
of the disease. Recent studies support this notion hence
establishing the striking intratumor genomic heterogeneity
when analyzing multiple regions of the same tumor in
individual cancer patients [42].
In summary, we found that in addition to loss of
FPGS enzyme activity, single nucleotide substitutions
in FPGS can result in alterations in allele expression.
This is due to a unique transcriptional regulatory role of
the downstream exon12 discovered herein, which is a
binding site for a Smad4/Ets-1 complex. The current study
constitutes the first report of the impact of the TGF-β/
Smad signaling pathway on FPGS gene expression.
These novel findings have important ramifications for the
rational overcoming of FPGS-based antifolate resistance
in leukemia.

Department of Hematology Oncology, Rambam Medical
Center, Haifa, Israel. The samples were previously derived
as part of the routine clinical management and were used
in the current study after receiving approval from the local
institutional review board (study no. 2902) at the Rambam
Medical Center and informed consent in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. White blood cells were
isolated from peripheral blood of patients or healthy
controls by a standard Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) gradient density centrifugation. The cells
were frozen in aliquots in fetal calf serum supplemented
with10% DMSO until analysis.

DNA sequencing and real-time PCR analysis
Cells (5x106) from the mid-log phase of growth
were harvested and total RNA was isolated using the
TRI Reagent kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). cDNA
synthesis was carried out using the High-Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems-Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and PCR was performed using
ReddyMix PCR Mastermix (Thermo scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). Sequencing was performed using a 3500xL
Genetic Analyzer for Resequencing & Fragment Analysis
(Applied Biosystems-Life Technologies). The primers
used for DNA sequencing are depicted in Table 3.
Real-time PCR was performed using an Applied
Biosystems-Life Technologies 7300 Real-Time PCR.
Quantitative PCR reaction (20μl) contained: 5ng of cDNA,
150nM of primers and 1x PerfeCTa qPCR FastMix, UNG,
ROX (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The
primers used for quantification of FPGS gene expression
were FPGS RT Fw and Rv. The primers used for allelic
quantification in MTA C-3 cells were exon12 WT Fw and
Rv and exon12 RQ Fw and Rv for the detection of the
WT and mutant alleles, respectively. Allele-specific PCR
was performed at a high Tm (70°C), and allele and gene
expression levels were normalized to β-2-microglobulin
(β2M) which was used as an internal control. To compare
the expression levels of the WT and mutant alleles of
FPGS in MTA C-3 cells to the expression of the WT allele
in CCRF-CEM cells, we first performed a real-time PCR
on known template amounts and compared the threshold
cycle (Ct) values obtained with each primer. We found
that the primers detecting the WT allele reached the Ct
value one cycle earlier than the primers detecting the RQ
allele. We then calculated the delta-Ct for each sample by
subtracting the Ct of the β2M gene from the WT/mutant
allele Ct. To compensate for the differences in primers Ct
values, we added one cycle to the delta Ct values obtained
with the WT allele primer. The results were then calculated
relative to the expression of the WT allele in CCRF-CEM
cells based on the 2-ΔΔCt method.
The primer sequences used for real-time PCR are
depicted in Table 3. Each experiment was performed

to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For the luciferase assay, MTA C-3 cells were
electroporated with 10µg of each vector together with
0.2µg of pRLO-Renilla vector (0.234kV). Thirty-six hours
following transfection, luciferase activity was determined
using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
on a GloMax 20/20 luminometer (Promega).

Cloning analysis
To determine relative allele expression in MTA C-3
cells, a PCR reaction was performed using the primers
FPGS 3 Fw and FPGS 3 Rv, spanning the region of the

in each experiment at least 20 clones were sequenced.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis
ChIP analysis on patient specimens and cell lines
was performed by harvesting 1-2×106 cells for each IP and
fixation with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. Cross-linking
was quenched with 125mM glycine for 5 min and fixed
cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were
then lysed with buffer A (5mM PIPES, pH 8.0, 85mM KCl
and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min on ice. The fraction
of crude nuclei was sedimented by microcentrifugation
(5000rpm, 5min, 4°C), washed with Nonidet P-40-free
buffer A, resuspended in buffer B (10mM EDTA, 50mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 1% SDS), and incubated on ice
for 10 min. The fraction of crude nuclei was sonicated
on ice ten times for 10s each with 10s intervals (Misonix
Microson, amplitude 3), followed by centrifugation
(16,000×g, 10min, 4°C). A 1/10 aliquot was preserved as
an input sample. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold in
immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (16.7mM Tris, pH 8.1,
167mM NaCl, 1.2mM EDTA, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton
X-100). Pre-clearing was performed by incubation of the
diluted protein-DNA samples with 10μl of MagnaBind
protein G beads (30min, 4°C; Thermo Scientific) to
eliminate unspecific adsorption to the beads. Samples were
then incubated with antibodies against histone H3 (2μg),
H3K9me2 (2μg), Sp1 (4μg), Smad2 (4μg), Smad4 (4μg),
Ets-1 (4μg), HP-1α (4μg), Brg-1 (4μg) and PolII (2μg)
(overnight, 4°C). Histone H3 and H3K9me2 antibodies
were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA), HP-1α

collect immune complexes, samples were incubated with
20μl of MagnaBind protein G beads (2h, 4°C), following
which 5 consecutive washes were performed (1ml wash,
5min each) with the following buffers: 1) low salt buffer
(20mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 2mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl,
0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100); 2) high salt buffer (the
same buffer except for the inclusion of 300mM NaCl);
3) LiCl buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.25M LiCl,
1mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1% deoxycholate);
4) TE buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.1); the
last wash was repeated twice. Immune complexes were
eluted twice by the addition of 100μl of elution buffer
(0.1M NaHCO3, 1% SDS) and incubated for 15 min with
rotation mixing at room temperature. To reverse crosslinking, the samples and input were incubated at 65°C for
2h in 200mM NaCl. Next, 40mM Tris-Cl (pH 6.5), 10mM
EDTA, and 20μg of pronase were added to each sample
which was then incubated at 42°C for 45 min. DNA was
isolated from each sample using the DNA Wizard® SV
Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). All buffers
were supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete
mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet, Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA).
Analysis of protein occupancy was performed using
real-time PCR. Occupancy was calculated as percent
of input for each of the genomic regions which were
analyzed. When occupancy was presented as percent
of CRYAA, we first determined the percent of input for
exon12, MP and UPE and then divided the results with
the percent of input for the CRYAA gene, obtained for each
antibody. The primer sequences used for real-time PCR

Statistical Analyses
We used a 1-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test to
examine the significance of the difference between the
control and treatment groups (N≥3). A difference was
considered significant if the P value obtained was < 0.05.
