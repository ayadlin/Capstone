ABSTRACT
Recent studies have shown that MMP-14 is highly expressed in a panel of human
solid tumors and poses as a potential molecular target for anticancer drugs. Currently,
major strategies for targeted therapeutics have mainly focused on the use of antibody
or ligand-based agents. For seeking an alternative approach, it is of interest to employ
endogenous proteins as drug delivery carriers. Considering the facts that TIMP2,
the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2, shows specific interaction with MMP14 and that Lidamycin (LDM), an extremely potent cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic,
consists of an apoprotein (LDP) and a highly active enediyne (AE); we designed and
prepared a TIMP2-based and enediyne-integrated fusion protein LDP(AE)-TIMP2 by
DNA recombination and molecular reconstitution consecutively. Furthermore, the
MMP-14 binding attributes of the active fusion protein were determined and its
therapeutic efficacy against human esophageal carcinoma KYSE150 xenograft and
human fibrosarcoma HT1080 xenograft models in nude mice was investigated. It is
suggested that TIMP2, the endogenous and MMP-14 binding protein, might serve as
a guided carrier for targeted therapeutics.

Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)
are endogenous proteins which can inhibit the activity
of MMPs. Previous studies have shown that when the
balance between TIMPs and MMPs is altered, it could
bring about the degradation of the extracellular matrix and
induce tumor cell invasion, migration or other receptormediated changes [6]. The pleiotropic activities of the
four-member TIMP family are perplexing, and hinge
upon direct interactions with tumor cells as well as on
the sophisticated interactions with other extracellular
components to a certain extent [7]. Among the TIMP
family members, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase
2 (TIMP2) is a distinguished one, because it not only
correlates with matrix remodeling and angiogenesis
suppressing, but also participates in the process of tumor
growth, inflammation and other diseases [8]. Extensive
study revealed that TIMP2 possesses the potential as
an anticancer agent. TIMP2 can bind to tumor cells in a
specific and saturable mode; whereas, the identification
of cell surface binding proteins for TIMP2 is complicated
by the presence of MMP-14, which is remained poorly
characterized [9]. In vitro study, MMP-14 is known as

INTRODUCTION
The development of targeted therapeutics,
for instance, antibody-based drugs, has made great
progress in recent years [1]. Besides antibody-based
drugs, exploring and developing new approaches,
such as, the use of endogenous proteins for targeted
cancer therapy are attractive and urgently needed. In
particular, it is essential to seek or design more efficient
carriers for drug delivery in association with the tumor
microenvironment.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zincdependent endopeptidases [2, 3]; among the MMP
members, the membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP/MMP14 plays a vital role in formation and progression of
most form of human tumors [4]. MMP-14 is not or low
expressed in majority of normal tissues, but widely
expressed and critical to the acquisition of the invasive
and metastatic phenotype of prostate, breast, melanoma
and ovarian carcinomas [5]; therefore, targeting MMP-14
is an effective approach to cancer therapy.

an important activator of pro-MMP-2 at the cell surface
via the involvement of TIMP2 [10]; for this reason, the
interactions among MMP-14, TIMP2 and MMP-2 are of
importance in cancer cell invasion and migration. In order
to develop a new strategy for targeted therapy, we tried to
design and construct fusion proteins on the basis of the
MMP-14/TIMP2/MMP-2 tri-molecular interaction model
[4]. Briefly, the study takes MMP-14 as the molecular
target and employs the TIMP2-based fusion protein as the
targeted drug carrier.
Lidamycin (LDM, also called C-1027) is an
antitumor antibiotic with extremely potent cytotoxicity.
The LDM molecule consists of an active enediyne
chromophore (AE, 843 Da) which is responsible for
the highly potent bioactivity, and a non-covalently
bound apoprotein (LDP, 10, 500 Da) which provides a
hydrophobic domain for stabilizing and protecting the
former [11]. As reported, AE and LDP can be dissociated
and reassembled in vitro under certain conditions; notably,
the reconstituted LDM displays similar properties to that
of natural LDM [12]. LDP and various LDP-containing
fusion proteins can be prepared by DNA recombination.
Furthermore, enediyne-integrated analogues can be
prepared by assembling AE into the engineered LDPcontaining fusion proteins.
In the present study, TIMP2-based and LDPcontaining fusion proteins, including LDP-TIMP2 and
TIMP2-LDP, were generated through the Pichia pastoris
expression system; and then the enediyne-integrated
analogues LDP(AE)-TIMP2 and TIMP2-LDP(AE)
were prepared as the above-mentioned procedure,
respectively. The study provides evidence that LDPTIMP2 possesses preferable targeting property than
TIMP2-LDP; additionally, the enediyne-integrated
analogue LDP(AE)-TIMP2 shows potent antitumor
efficacy in vitro and in vivo.

Seven cancer cell lines were analyzed for MMP2 and MMP-14 expression levels by Western blotting
analysis. As shown in Figure 2A, high level expression
of MMP-2 was found in six of the tested cell lines,
including KYSE150, H460, HT1080 and others. Higher
level expression of MMP-14 was detected in three of
the six cell lines, namely, KYSE150, HT1080 and A431
cells. The Co-IP results in Figure 2B showed the binding
capability of LDP-TIMP2 to both MMP-14 and MMP-2 in
KYSE150 cells. In addition, the binding of LDP-TIMP2 to
MMP-14 in KYSE150 cells was more intensive than that
in H460 cells.
To compare the binding efficiency of LDP-TIMP2
and TIMP2-LDP to various cancer cell lines, KYSE150,
HT1080 and H460 cells were examined by ELISA. At the
same time, the protein LDP was used as control. As shown
in Figure 2C, both of the fusion proteins bound to the
three tested cell lines positively. In addition, the binding
intensity of LDP-TIMP2 was stronger than that of TIMP2LDP in KYSE150 cells.
The binding capability of FITC-labeled LDP-TIMP2
to KYSE150, HT1080 and H460 cells was evaluated by
FACS analysis (Figure 2D). As shown, the binding and
uptake occurred in a concentration-dependent manner
in the three tested cell lines; moreover, the intensity was
much higher in KYSE150 cells. As presented in Figure 2E,
the binding and uptake of LDP-TIMP2 in KYSE150 cells
were further confirmed by using laser scanning confocal
microscope (LEICA TCS SP5). When FITC-labeled LDPTIMP2 incubated with KYSE150 cells at 37°C for 1 h,
it clearly showed that the fluorescence distributed on cell
membrane and in cytoplasm.

Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry
On the basis of the above binding affinity assessment
in vitro, we tested the binding capability of LDP-TIMP2
and LDP to human cancer specimens through tissue
microarray of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and
matched adjacent tissues. The scanning pattern image of
LDP-TIMP2 was presented in Figure 3A. The evaluation
standards were presented in Figure 3B. According to
the evaluation standards, the classification of samples
was shown in Figure 3C. As shown in Figure 3D, the
representative results between tumors and their matched
adjacent tissues denoted significant difference. Evidently,
it suggests that the fusion protein LDP-TIMP2 binds
to tumor tissue preferably as compared with matched
adjacent tissue.

RESULTS
Construction, preparation and characterization
of fusion proteins and their enediyne-integrated

As shown in Figure 1A, The DNA fragments
encoding for fusion proteins LDP-TIMP2 and TIMP2LDP were obtained by genetic engineering. The primary
determination of protein expression strains was analyzed
by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, which were presented
at Figure 1B and Figure 1C. The purity of LDP-TIMP2
and TIMP2-LDP was assayed by HPLC and shown in
Figure 1D and 1E. Following, the enediyne-integrated
fusion proteins were prepared by assembling the active
AE molecule of LDM into LDP-TIMP2 and TIMP2-LDP,
respectively. The result of reverse-phase HPLC in Figure
1F and 1G showed that the AE molecule was assembled
successfully.

an endothelial tube formation assay was used to evaluate the
anti-angiogenic function of TIMP2-based fusion proteins.
Determined by total tube length and number of junctions,
both LDP-TIMP2 and TIMP2-LDP inhibited tube formation
and their efficacy were stronger than that of LDP (Figure 5A
and 5C). Moreover, both LDP-TIMP2 and TIMP2-LDP
suppressed HUVEC cells proliferation as determined by

that to HT1080 and H460 tumors, by contrast, TIMP2LDP showed little accumulation in tumor location. This
observation was consistent with in vitro results, which
further indicated that LDP-TIMP2 was more suitable than
TIMP2-LDP as a targeting delivery carrier.

strategy for inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis [13,

administered intravenously, once a week, a total of 2
injections. For the control group, mice were injected with
physiological saline. As shown in Figure 5A, the enediyneintegrated fusion protein LDP(AE)-TIMP2 markedly
inhibited the growth of KYSE150 xenograft. Determined
by the end of the experiment, LDP(AE)-TIMP2 at doses
of 0.20 mg/kg, 0.35 mg/kg and 0.50 mg/kg inhibited the
growth of KYSE150 xenograft by 64%, 76% and 82%,
respectively; while LDM inhibited tumor growth by
60%. No deaths and no major body weight changes were
found in mice of treated groups (Figure 5B). These results
suggested that the TIMP2-based and enediyne-integrated
protein LDP(AE)-TIMP2 was highly effective against
esophageal squamous carcinoma xenograft.

therapeutic efficacy in HT1080 xenograft in athymic mice.

By histopathological examination, no toxicopathological changes were found in the heart, lung,
liver, small intestine, kidney and femur bone marrow of
the athymic mice treated with various dosage levels of
LDP(AE)-TIMP2. This indicated that the administered
doses of tested agents were well tolerated.

DISCUSSION
Currently, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
are known to be one of the most prominent family of
proteinases associated with tumorigenesis; particularly,
its family member MMP-14 causes much attention as
a promising drug target for its membrane-anchored
characteristic and the effects in promoting various cancers
progression [17]. As reported, MMP-14 plays a pivotal
role in conferring tumor cells with the capability to
degrade extracellular matrix ingredients, correlating with
tumor invasion and metastasis; MMP-14 is also involved

in regulating the release of angiogenic factors in tumor
microenvironment and promoting blood vessel formation
associated with tumor growth [18, 19]. Recent studies
indicated that higher expression of MMP-14 is related
to poorer prognosis and shorter survival time in patients
with some types of cancer. Studies on the mechanism of
activation have shown that MMP-14 plays a role as the
receptor for TIMP2 [20], while the N-terminal domain of
TIMP2 can bind with the catalytic domain of MMP-14,
as well as MMP2, resulting in the formation of a MMP14/TIMP2/MMP-2 tri-molecular complex. This provides
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

evidence that TIMP2 can bind to MMP-14 in a unique
manner, accordingly, TIMP2 may be able to serve as a
MMP-14 directed carrier for targeted drug delivery.
In tumor microenvironment, the relation of
cancer cells and the stroma is highly complicated and
it keeps changing over time. Collaborative interactions
among cancer cells with cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs), vascular system as well as a dynamic network
of the extracellular matrix (ECM), might promote tumor
formation, unlimited progression or eventual metastasis
[21]. As shown, normal tissue fibroblasts primarily

suppress tumor formation; however, CAFs can probably
involve in tumorigenesis [22]. Moreover, uneven or
defective vascular system can generate distinct TME,
promoting tumor heterogeneity and finally affecting
the pre-clinical or clinical therapeutic effects. Besides
tumor cells, different types of stromal cells produce and
release a number of specific MMPs and their natural
inhibitors, and the delicate balance between MMPs and
TIMPs potentially determines the progression of tumors.
Accumulating studies have provided firm supports
for the important roles of TIMPs in the TME. Among
the four members of human TIMP family, TIMP2 has
been investigated as a promising antitumor agent for its
essential functions in tissue remodeling, tumor growth
and angiogenesis inhibition [23]. TIMP2 can increase
cell-cell adhesion, effectively inhibiting tumor growth,
migration, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT). TIMP2 can reduce the phosphorylation of ERK
and AKT, subsequently, suppress endothelial growth and
angiogenesis [24]. TIMP2 can also bind to the integrinα3β1 receptor [25], which causes the signaling cascades,
eventually lead to the hypo-phosphorylation of VEGFR-2
and the up-regulation of the anti-migration factor, RECK.
Targeted therapy encompasses a wide variety of
strategies. Especially, entire monoclonal antibody or
antibody fragment-based drugs have been found to be
effective in this area [26, 27]; furthermore, antibody
and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapeutics have
been applied for cancer treatment [28-30]. In recent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

years, several MMP-14-directed antibodies have been
developed and their reactivity with the target have been
reported [4, 5, 31]. In addition, the underlying molecular
mechanisms of antibody action have been investigated
[32, 33], however, antibody-drug conjugate and fusion
protein targeting MMP-14 have not yet been reported.
Based upon these, it is interesting to seek an alternative
and effective way for targeting MMP-14, therefore, we put
forward a new strategy for MMP-14 targeted therapy that
uses TIMP2 as the binding molecule on the basis of its
specific interaction with MMP-14 to prepare relevant drug
conjugates or fusion proteins.
LDM is known for its extremely potent cytotoxicity
against cultured cancer cells, compared in terms of IC50
values, the cytotoxicity is over 1, 000 times more potent
than that of doxorubicin. In our laboratory, we have
designed a variety of antibody or ligand-based targeted
drugs, for instance, EGFR/HER2 bispecific and enediyneenergized fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE [34], gelatinase
targeting diabody-based fusion protein dFv-LDP-AE
[35], as well as a novel polymer-protein conjugate, DexrLDP-AE [36]; accordingly, obtained preferable targeted
attributes and significant therapeutic efficacy in nude mice
xenograft models. In this study, we constructed a TIMP2based and enediyne-integrated fusion protein LDP(AE)TIMP2 that targets MMP-14; actually, it is a TIMP2-drug
conjugate (TDC) in nature, close to ADC in many aspects.
For the purpose of avoiding the renaturation troubles of
inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli expression system,
26329

we employed Pichia pastoris secretory expression system
to produce the fusion protein, further guaranteeing the
biologic activity of each component. In summary, we
consider that the TIMP2-based and enediyne-integrated
fusion protein LDP(AE)-TIMP2 could be a promising
agent in cancer targeted therapy; without doubt, further
validations of the drug are also needed.

phosphate buffer, pH 6.0), and incubated in Erlenmeyer
flasks on a rotary shaker for 36 h (30°C, 280 rpm). The
cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3, 000 × g for
5 min and resuspended in BMMY medium (1% Yeast
extract, 2% Bacto peptone, 1% Methanol, 1.34% YNB,
4 × 10−5 % Biotin, with 100 mM Potassium phosphate
buffer, pH 6.0). The culture was maintained for another
96 h with the addition of 1% (v/v) pure methanol at every
24 h to sustain the induction conditions. Subsequently, the
culture was harvested by centrifugation (3, 000 × g for
10 min) at room temperature (RT), and the supernatant
collected both from pre-induced and induced cultures
was analyzed for the expression of the proteins by SDSPAGE under denaturing conditions. Cell growth and
recombinant proteins production during the induction
phase were optimized in shake flasks by analyzing the
effect of pH, temperature, induction time as well as the
addition of methanol [37, 38]. The fusion proteins were
purified by affinity chromatography (His Trap HP, GE
Healthcare) according to the operation manual. The
protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein
assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
The AE of LDM was separated by C4 column (GE
Healthcare) with a 22% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroactic
acid mobile phase. For preparation of enediyne-integrated
fusion proteins LDP(AE)-TIMP2 and TIMP2-LDP(AE),
the AE-containing solution was added to LDP-TIMP2/PBS
(10 mM pH7.4) or TIMP2-LDP/PBS, respectively, with the
molecular ratio of 3:1, and incubated at 4°C for more than
12 h while rocking. Finally, free AE was removed with a
Sephadex G-75 column (GE Healthcare). The resultant
enediyne-integrated fusion proteins named LDP(AE)-TIMP2
and TIMP2-LDP(AE) were confirmed by reverse-phase
HPLC using a Vydac C4 300A column (Grace), respectively.
Absorbance at 340 nm was measured accordingly.

supplemented with 10% (v/v) of heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Gibco; Life Technologies), penicillin
G (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL). The human
pancreatic carcinoma cell line PANC-1 was cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Hyclone; Thermo
Fisher Scientific) supplemented with the same ingredients.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were
cultured in VascuLife basal medium (LIFELINE Cell
Technology) supplemented with LifeFactorsR. All cell
lines were cultured in an incubator, maintained at 37°C
with 5% CO2.

Construction of expression vectors
As shown in Figure 1A, the full gene fragments of
the fusion proteins LDP-TIMP2 and TIMP2-LDP mainly
consist of the gene encoding TIMP2 (194 amino acids),
apoprotein LDP (110 amino acids) and the linker peptide
(GlyGlyGlyGlySer)2. After molecular biology process, the
resultant 942-bp fragments were digested by SnaB I/Not
I, inserted into expression vector to generate expression
plasmids pHBM-LDP-TIMP2 and pHBM-TIMP2-LDP.
DNA sequencing determination was accomplished by the
method provided by Invitrogen Corp.

Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation
analyses
Cell lysates were collected for analysis of MMP2 and MMP-14 protein levels. After the cultured cells
reached approximately 85% confluence, the culture
supernatant was removed and the cells were washed
three times with PBS. Then the total cellular protein was
obtained using an ice-cold high efficiency RIPA tissue/
cell lysis buffer supplemented with 1% (v/v) of protease
inhibitor at 4°C for 20 min (Beijing Solarbio Science &
Technology Co., Ltd). After centrifugation at 4°C (15, 000
× g for 15 min), the supernatant was harvested and the total
protein was quantified. The same amount of protein for
each cell sample (30 μg) was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto a PVDF membrane, then blocked
with 5% skim milk for 2 h, incubated with respective
primary antibody (MMP-2 antibody, 1/1000 dilution, Cell
Signaling Technology; MMP-14 antibody, 1/1000 dilution,

were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence
kit (Merck Millipore, USA). At least three independent
experiments were carried out in Western blotting analysis.
For co-immunoprecipitation assay, KYSE150 and
H460 cells were pretreated as those in Western blotting.
Thereafter, 200 μg of protein samples extracting from cell
lysates were incubated with 50 μg LDP-TIMP2 protein
at 4°C for 2 h under rotation, followed by overnight
incubation with 0.3 μg anti-MMP-2 or anti-MMP-14
antibody at 4°C under rotation. Subsequently, 40 μL of
Protein A+G Agarose (Beyotime, China) were added at
4°C for 2 h under rotation. The pellets were collected by
centrifugation (1, 000 × g for 5 min) and washed with PBS
5 min each for five times. Then, the cells were resuspended
in 40 μL of electrophoresis loading buffer and boiled for
10 min. Finally, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis
were performed as described above. The mouse antiHis tag monoclonal antibody (1/2000 dilution; Abmart
Biotechnology) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
were used for detecting LDP-TIMP2 protein [34].

and matched adjacent tissues (OD-CT-DgEso03-002) were
provided and processed by Shanghai Outdo Biotech Co.,
Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Briefly, the main experimental
procedure is as follows: sections were proceeded as
dewaxing, microwave antigen retrieval, endogenous
peroxidase blocking, and then incubated with the primary
antibody (fusion protein LDP-TIMP2 or protein LDP)
overnight, and the second antibody (His-Tag mAb/HRP
Conjugated) for 0.5 h, respectively. Finally, the specimens
were determined with DAB detection and hematoxylin
staining.

In vivo imaging of fluorescein-labeled proteins
The tumor-targeting ability of LDP-TIMP2 and
TIMP2-LDP was investigated using KYSE150, HT1080
and H460 xenografts in athymic mice. When the solid
tumors reached a volume of about 100-200 mm3, FITClabeled LDP-TIMP2 (or TIMP2-LDP) was injected into
the tail veins of mice (n = 3) at a dosage of 30 mg/kg.
Following, the mice were anesthetized by isofluorane at a
series of time intervals and placed in the imaging chamber
of an IVIS-200 system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA, USA) for
observation. The images were also processed with imaging
system software.

Binding affinity analyses of fusion proteins
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was
used for measuring the binding efficiency of LDP, TIMP2LDP and LDP-TIMP2 to tumor cells. Cells (1 × 104 per
well) were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C
with 5% CO2 for 24 h. After fixed with 4% formaldehyde
at 4°C for 30 min and blocked with 1% BSA/PBS at
4°C overnight, the cells were incubated with serial
concentrations of proteins at 37°C for 2 h, and then, mouse
anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (1/2000 dilution) at 37°C
for 2 h and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (1/2500 dilution) at 37°C for 2 h, respectively.
Subsequently, 3, 3′, 5, 5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Soluble
TMB Substrate Solution; Tiangen Biotechnology, Beijing,
China) was added at RT for 20 min, and followed by the
addition of stop solution (2 M H2SO4). The absorbance
at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader
(Multiskan MK3; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA).
All assays were carried out in triplicate.
For flow cytometry analysis, cell suspensions
(5 × 105 cells/sample) were incubated with various
concentrations of FITC-labeled LDP-TIMP2 at RT for 2 h
with slow shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation
(1, 000 rpm for 5 min). After three times of PBS washing,
cells were resuspended in 500 μL of PBS, and analyzed
using a flow cytometer (BD FACS Calibur).
The laser scanning confocal microscope-based
analysis was also designed to examine binding and uptake
ability of KYSE150 cells to LDP-TIMP2 [39].

In vitro anti-angiogenic analyses
Tube formation assay was performed as the
following protocol [40, 41]. Briefly, matrigel membrane
matrix (Vigorous Biotechnology Beijing Co., Ltd) was
thawed at 4°C overnight. A 48-well plate and 200 μL
pipette tips were also placed on ice during the entire
experiment. The plate was coated with 150 uL of matrigel
per well and incubated at 37°C for 4 h to allow gelation
to occur. Then, HUVEC cells (3 × 104 per well) were
plated to the top of the gel in the presence of the LDP,
different concentrations of LDP-TIMP2 and TIMP2-LDP,
respectively. Tube formation was observed after 18 h
and photographed by using an inverted microscope. For
comparison of the effect of the tested agents, tube length
and number of junctions were determined using Image J
software. Each treatment was performed in triplicate.

Cell viability assay
For the MTT assay, tumor cells were trypsinized
and seeded at a density of 4, 000 per well in a 96-well
plate, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 12 h.
Then different concentrations of drugs were added in
triplicate, respectively. After 48 h, cells were incubated
with MTT solution (20 μL, 5 mg/mL) for an additional 4
h. Following, the culture supernatant was removed, 150
μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added to each
well and agitated for 10 min. The absorbance (A) was
recorded at 570 nm with a microplate reader (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, USA). Untreated cells served as control.

For the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo,
Japan) assay. Briefly, human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVEC) were seeded at 3, 000 cells/well into a 96well plate, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 overnight.
Then, the culture supernatant was removed, fresh medium
as well as various treatments were added in triplicate,
respectively. After 48 h incubation, the culture supernatant
was removed, 100 μL of fresh medium containing 10%
CCK-8 reagent was added and incubated for 4 h. The
absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate
reader. Untreated cells served as control. The relative cell

euthanized. Specimens of the tumor and various organs
were taken and fixed in 10% formalin. Then the paraffinembedded specimens were cut into sections of 5 μm in
thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E).
Histopathological changes were observed with the Leica
microscope.

Statistical analysis
All of the experimental data were presented as
the mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed with
Graphpad Prism 5 software. One-way ANOVA followed
by Student’s t-test was used to compare the effect of
treatment with the control, and P values less than 0.05
were defined to be statistically significant.

Animal models for therapeutic efficacy
KYSE150 and HT1080 xenograft models were
used for evaluation of in vivo antitumor efficacy. Female
athymic nude mice (BALB/c, nu/nu, 18-22 g) were
purchased from the Institute for Experimental Animals,
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union
Medical College. All experimental protocols were in
accordance with the regulations of Good Laboratory
Practice for non-clinical laboratory studies of drugs issued
by the National Scientific and Technologic Committee
of People’ Republic of China. The 6- to 8-week-old
athymic mice were inoculated subcutaneously (s. c.) with
exponentially growing human esophageal carcinoma
KYSE150 cells (2 × 106 cells per mouse) and human
fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (2 × 106 cells per mouse),
respectively.
After about 2 weeks, the grown tumors were excised
aseptically. After removing the necrotic parts, the semitransparent tumor mass was cut into pieces about 2 mm3
in size, and transplanted subcutaneously using a trocar
separately into the right flanks of mice. When tumors
reached about 100 mm3 in size, mice were randomly
divided into several groups (n = 6 per group) and treated
with LDP-TIMP2, TIMP2-LDP, natural LDM, or different
dosages of LDP(AE)-TIMP2, respectively. The tested
agents were injected intravenously through the lateral tail
vein, a total of 2 injections with a 7 or 6 day interval. One
group of mice was given physiological saline, serving
as control. During the experiment period, tumor sizes
were measured with a caliper, and tumor volumes were
calculated using the formula: V (mm3) = 0.5 × a × b2,
where a, and b indicated the long and the perpendicular
short diameters of the tumor, respectively. The inhibition
rate of tumor growth was calculated as: 100 × {1-[(tumor
volume final-tumor volume initial for the treated group)/
(tumor volume final-tumor volume initial for the control
group)]}. At the end of the experiment, the mice were
