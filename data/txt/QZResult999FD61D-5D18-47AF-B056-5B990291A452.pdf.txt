Abstract
PTEN loss or PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation correlates with human prostate cancer progression and
metastasis. However, in preclinical murine models, deletion of Pten alone fails to mimic the signiﬁcant metastatic
burden that frequently accompanies the end stage of human disease. To identify additional pathway alterations
that cooperate with PTEN loss in prostate cancer progression, we surveyed human prostate cancer tissue
microarrays and found that the RAS/MAPK pathway is signiﬁcantly elevated in both primary and metastatic
lesions. In an attempt to model this event, we crossed conditional activatable K-rasG12D/WT mice with the prostate
conditional Pten deletion model. Although RAS activation alone cannot initiate prostate cancer development, it
signiﬁcantly accelerated progression caused by PTEN loss, accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and macrometastasis with 100% penetrance. A novel stem/progenitor subpopulation with mesenchymal
characteristics was isolated from the compound mutant prostates, which was highly metastatic upon orthotopic
transplantation. Importantly, inhibition of RAS/MAPK signaling by PD325901, a mitogen–activated protein
(MAP)–extracellular signal–regulated (ER) kinase (MEK) inhibitor, signiﬁcantly reduced the metastatic progression initiated from transplanted stem/progenitor cells. Collectively, our ﬁndings indicate that activation of
RAS/MAPK signaling serves as a potentiating second hit to alteration of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT axis, and
cotargeting both the pathways is highly effective in preventing the development of metastatic prostate cancers.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common male malignancy and a
frequent cause of mortality in Western countries (1). During
late-stage disease, oncogenic signaling pathways act collaboratively to promote metastasis and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) development. Alteration of the PTEN/
PI3K/AKT pathway is well correlated with prostate cancer
development with about 70% of late-stage samples showing
PTEN loss or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation (2).
The Pten-null prostate cancer model mimics human disease,
including hyperplasia, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia,

and invasive carcinoma, with deﬁned kinetics (3). However,
inactivation of Pten alone (3–5) or in combination with homozygous deletion of p53 (6, 7) or Nkx3.1 (8) fails to recapitulate
the critical aspect of end-stage human prostate cancer, that is,
signiﬁcant metastatic burden. Thus, identiﬁcation of signaling
mechanisms that collaborate with alteration of the PI3K
pathway in promoting prostate cancer metastasis is critical
for modeling late stage of human disease and for testing
therapeutic strategies.
Despite the low frequencies of RAS mutations (9–12) and
RAS fusion events (13), compelling evidence suggests that RAS/
MAPK pathway activation plays a signiﬁcant role in human
prostate cancer progression, particularly, in metastasis and
CRPC development. Enhanced RAS signaling can reduce
dependency for androgens in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell
line (14), whereas inhibition of RAS can restore hormone
dependence in C42 cells, a line that is otherwise hormone
independent (14, 15). Furthermore, patients who have failed
hormone ablation therapy display augmentation of p-mitogen–activated protein kinase (MAPK) levels, a downstream
target of RAS signaling (16). Finally, RAS activation in the
DU145 human prostate cancer cell line can promote metastasis to the brain and bone (17). Despite these in vitro observations, it is unclear that (i) whether activation of the RAS/MAPK
pathway is sufﬁcient to initiate the full spectrum of prostate
cancer development and (ii) whether the RAS/MAPK pathway

can collaborate with the PTEN/PI3K pathway in promoting
metastasis and CRPC development.
We hypothesized that activating the RAS/MAPK pathway in
conjunction with reduced Pten dosage may promote metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we incorporated the activating KrasG12D/WT allele (18), as a means to activate the RAS/MAPK
axis, to the Pten-null prostate cancer model that we generated
previously (3). We report here the important collaborative
effects of RAS/MAPK and PTEN/PI3K pathways in promoting
prostate cancer metastasis and potential molecular mechanisms underlying such collaboration. Collectively, our results
suggest that RAS/MAPK pathway activation may serve as a
critical "second hit" to PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway alterations to
androgen-dependent prostate cancer and CRPC.

Methods
Human tissue microarray and bone metastasis samples
Human prostate cancer tissue microarrays (TMA) are composed of 194 patients and 388 cores (19). Histopathologic
composition of the array is outlined in Supplementary Fig.
S1. All bone metastasis are from patients with prostate cancer
with abnormal bone scans.
Mouse strains, tissue collection and reconstitution
Mutant mice with prostate-speciﬁc deletion of Pten were
generated as previously described under a mixed background
(3). To generate the Pb-Creþ;PtenL/L;K-rasG12D/W or Pb-Creþ;
PtenL/W;K-rasG12D/W mice, Pb-Creþ;PtenL/W male mice were
bred with female Cre;PtenL/L;K-rasG12D/W mice (20). To generate Pb-Creþ;PtenL/L;K-rasG12D/W;LSL-Rosa26-LacZ or Pb-Creþ;
PtenL/L;K-rasG12D/W;LSL-Rosa26-Luc mice, Creþ;PtenL/L;KrasG12D/W male mice were bred with female, Cre;PtenL/L;
LSL-Rosa26-LacZ (21) or Cre;PtenL/L;LSL-Rosa26-Luc (LSLRosa26-Luc was obtained from National Cancer Institute
eMICE Strain 01XAC). All animal housing, breeding, and
surgical procedures were conducted under the regulation of
the Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine at the University of
California at Los Angeles (UCLA; Los Angeles, CA).
mRNA extraction and microarray hybridization
RNA was extracted from pooled lobes resected from mutant
prostates. Microarrays were conducted in the UCLA Clinical
Microarray Facility using Affymetrix mouse 430 2 arrays. In
brief, total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen). Array hybridization, washing, and scanning were
carried out as per the manufacturer's instructions. For genes
represented by multiple probes, its expression was represented
by the average of its probe expressions. Microarray data are
available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE34839).
Rank–rank analysis
In rank–rank geometric overlap analysis (RRHO), genes in
human data sets derived from the studies of Lapointe and
colleagues (22) and Taylor and colleagues (2) were ranked on
the basis of their log-transformed P values of t test comparing
between 2 subgroups/genotypes as previously described (23,
24).

Immunohistochemistry and LacZ detection
To detect LacZþ cells, frozen sections were ﬁxed in
methanol, followed by X-gal staining (25) for 6 to 12 hours,
and then counterstained with Fast Red. Immunohistochemistry was carried out as previously described (3, 26) using the
following antibodies: PTEN (Cell Signaling Technology;
9559), p-MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology; 4376), androgen
receptor (AR; Santa Cruz; sc-816), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma;
C1801), E-cadherin (Cell Signaling Technology; 610181),
vimentin (Abcam; ab39376), p-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology; 3787), Ki67 (Vector; VP-RM04), and p63 (BD Transduction; 559952).
FACS analysis and cell sorting
Cell isolation was carried out as previously described (26)
using the following ﬂuorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS)
antibodies: Sca1-PE (BD Pharm; 553336), CD49f-APC (Biolegend; 313610), EpCAM-APC/Cy7 (Biolegend; 118218), and
CD24-PE/Cy7 (Biolegend; 101822).
Real time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from the mouse prostate or from
the sorted cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and puriﬁed
using an RNeasy Mini column (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturers' protocols. One microgram of puriﬁed total
RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA by the High-Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) with the
random primers and MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase. The
relative gene expressions were measured by real-time PCR
using the gene-speciﬁc primers and iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad) compared with the RPL13a RNA quantity for each
cDNA sample as an endogenous control. Primers used for cell
lineage marker expression were used as previously described
(27) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers
as follows: Cdh1: F, CAGGTCTCCTCATGGCTTTGC, R,

Orthotopic injections, bioluminescence imaging, and
measurement of lung lesions
Prostate sphere cells or subpopulations of primary cancer
cells were isolated from Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W;LSL-Luc mutant
prostates. Prostate orthotopic injections were carried out
using approximately 2,000 cells in 50% Matrigel/media using
a 10 mL Hamilton syringe (Microliter #701). Tumor development was then monitored using bioluminescence detection (Xenogen IVIS, Caliper Life Sciences). For measurement
of lung lesions, accumulated lesion area per mouse was
measured and then calculated as a percentage of total lung
section area. Tibial, orthotopic injections to NOD;SCID;
IL2rg-null recipients were carried out using a 10 mL Hamilton syringe (Microliter #701) to deliver no more than 1,000
Pten/;K-rasG12D cells injected in 10 mL volume of 50%
Matrigel/media.
Drug treatment
NOD;SCID;IL2rg-null mice with various orthotopic transplantations were treated with rapamycin (4 mg/kg/d, intraperitoneally) and/or PD325901 (5 mg/kg/d, per os) daily for 14
days.

Results
RAS/MAPK pathway is activated in human primary and
metastatic prostate cancer lesions
Of several well-known pathway alterations found in human
prostate cancers is the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway, showing
frequencies of 43% and 90% alteration in primary and metastatic lesions, respectively (2). To investigate the potential
collaboration between the PTEN/PI3K and RAS/MAPK pathways, we assessed the correlation between PTEN loss and
MAPK activation using (i) a human prostate cancer TMA
composed of 194 patients and 388 cores (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1) and (ii) 30 human prostate cancer bone
metastasis specimens obtained from 4 U.S. medical institutions (Fig. 1B). While p-MAPK levels were not signiﬁcantly
elevated in untreated specimens, levels were signiﬁcantly
increased in neoadjuvant-treated (neoadjuvant hormone therapy) and recurrent patients with CRPC as compared with
benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens, coinciding with at
least a 1-fold reduction in PTEN expression (Fig. 1A,  , P <
0.05;  , P < 0.005). In metastatic bone lesions, we observed
elevated p-MAPK staining in 80% (24 of 30) of samples (Fig.
1B), a ﬁnding similar to what was reported previously for
lymph node metastasis (28). In nearly all bone lesions, PTEN
expression was low or negative (Fig. 1B, right). Interestingly,
prominent p-MAPK expression was found near the basal
compartment, corresponding to the potential transient
amplifying stem/progenitor cell populations in human bone
metastatic lesions (Fig. 1B, arrow). Collectively, these data
indicate that the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway is highly
active in human prostate cancer speciﬁcally in patients who
have received anti-androgen therapy. These data also suggest that there may be selection for coinciding activation of
PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK signaling in patients with latestage disease.

PTEN loss and RAS activation cooperate in accelerating
primary and metastatic prostate cancer progression
To assess the role of RAS pathway activation in promoting
prostate cancer development and metastasis, we conditionally
activated K-ras in the prostatic epithelium by crossing the KrasG12D/W (K-rasL/W; ref. 29) allele to the Pb-Cre line (Cþ; ref. 30).
While RAS activation was sufﬁcient to enhance p-MAPK levels,
it failed to promote signiﬁcant cell proliferation, AKT activation, and prostate cancer development (Supplementary Fig.
S2). Therefore, activation of the RAS pathway alone is not
sufﬁcient to induce prostate cancer. To assess RAS/MAPK
activation as an additional hit to PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway
alteration in promoting prostate cancer progression, we
crossed Pb-Creþ;PtenL/L mice (Cþ;PtenL/L) with K-rasL/W mice
to generate Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutants. In comparison to Cþ;
PtenL/L mutants, simultaneously deleting Pten and activating
K-ras led to early lethality (Fig. 2A, comparing red and green
lines) with enhanced progression at both gross (Fig. 2B; arrows,
anterior lobes; solid black arrowheads, dorsolateral lobes) and
histologic levels (Fig. 2C). While pathology in Cþ;PtenL/L
mutants was predominantly adenocarcinoma localized to the
dorsolateral lobes, Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutants showed invasive carcinoma both in the dorsolateral and anterior lobes as
early as 4 weeks with poorly differentiated carcinoma occurring by 10 weeks (Fig. 2B and C).
Because partially reduced PTEN expression occurs frequently during human prostate cancer progression (Fig. 1B; refs. 31,
32), we then considered whether loss of a single Pten allele
could also cooperate with RAS activation. While under the
genetic background we studied, neither Cþ;PtenL/WT (3, 26, 24)
nor Cþ;K-rasL/WT mutants showed little evidence of cancer
when older than 1 year (data not shown and Supplementary
Fig. S2), Cþ;PtenL/W;K-rasL/W mice developed focal neoplastic
expansions by 10 weeks, invasive carcinoma by 20 weeks
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B), and lethality around 40
weeks (Fig. 2A, orange line) accompanied by PTEN loss and pAKT-S473 activation (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Importantly, in contrast to micrometastasis seen in 15% to
30% of age- and genetic background–matched Cþ;PtenL/L mice
(3), both Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W and Cþ;PtenL/W;K-rasL/W mutants
developed macrometastatic lesions in the lung and liver with
100% penetrance (Fig. 3A). Lesions were largely pan-cytokeratin positive (Fig. 3A) with activated MAPK and PTEN loss (Fig.
3B). Interestingly, AR expression was highly heterogeneous in
lung lesions (Fig. 3A) and primary tumor samples from Cþ;
PtenL/W;K-rasL/W mutants (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Moreover,
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that Cþ;PtenL/L;KrasL/W mutant prostates have reduced expression of AR target
genes (Supplementary Fig. S3C), in comparison to Cþ;PtenL/L
mutants, including Mme, Msmb, and Nkx3.1 (Supplementary
Fig. S3C).
Importantly, cells with genotype of Creþ, Pten deletion and
activated K-ras were detected in 4 of 6 bone marrow ﬂushes of
Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W or Cþ;PtenL/W;K-rasL/W mutants (Fig. 3C).
However, because of early lethality of these animals, we did not
observe overt metastasis in the bone at the histologic level or by
bone imaging (data not shown). Collectively, our results indicate that the cooperation between PTEN loss and RAS

RAS activation promotes Pten-null epithelial cells to
undergo EMT and acquisition of a human prostate
cancer signature
A striking feature found in Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W and Cþ;PtenL/W;
K-rasL/W prostates was the mesenchymal morphology associated with the aggressive behavior of cancer cells, similar to
poorly differentiated human cancers (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Similar to human prostate cancer, we observed a loss of p63
expression in the basal compartment of cancerous acini of
Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutants (Supplementary Fig. S5A). We
also observed further reduction of p53 and p27 in Cþ;PtenL/L;

deletion (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Consistent with EMT

phenotype, we observed enhanced N-cadherin expression in
transition regions, especially in poorly differentiated cancer,
indicating that many of these cells displayed neuroendocrine
expansion. Interestingly, synaptophysin-positive cells were
generally rare in this new model (Supplementary Fig. S5C).
To assess the role of Ras activation in promoting EMT in
Pten-null epithelium, we examined regions with morphologic
transition using the epithelial (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal
markers (vimentin; Fig. 4A). While adenocarcinoma and mesenchymal cancer regions showed distinct marker expression,
transition regions showed coexpression of both epithelial and
mesenchymal markers (Fig. 4A, yellow in overlay).
To ascertain that the observed mesenchymal pathology
occurred as a result of a true EMT, and not expansion of the
native stromal compartment, we crossed a Cre-activatable
LacZ reporter line (LSL-Rosa26-LacZ; ref. 25) onto the

compound mutant line. Because LacZ expression is activated
by the same Cre recombinase, LacZþ cells could be used for
lineage tracing for those Pten-null and Ras-activated epithelial
cells. Analysis of Cþ;PtenL/L;LSL-Rosa26-LacZ mutant prostates
showed LacZ-positive regions to be restricted to prostate
epithelium (data not shown); however, Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W;
LSL-Rosa26-LacZ prostates showed expansion of LacZ-positive
cells from epithelial acini (Fig. 4B, arrows) to regions with
mesenchymal morphology (Fig. 4B, arrowheads in middle).
These data indicate that RAS activation facilitates EMT of Ptennull epithelial cells.
We then conducted unbiased microarray analysis on ageand genetic background–matched Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W and
Cþ;PtenL/L prostates (n ¼ 3; 10 weeks) and found that 370
and 336 genes were signiﬁcantly up- and downregulated for
more than 3-fold, respectively, due to RAS activation. Among
those upregulated genes, 11 were EMT-associated genes (P
¼ 1.7e-13, Fisher's exact test; Fig. 4C). We further validated

1882

Cancer Res; 72(7) April 1, 2012

the array analysis by real-time PCR using independent
prostate samples from Cþ;K-rasL/W, Cþ;PtenL/L, and Cþ;
PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutants at 10 weeks of age. Prostates from
Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutants showed signiﬁcantly enhanced
expression of EMT markers including Snail (Snail), vimentin
(Vim), Fibronectin (Fn1), MMP2 (Mmp2), Twist (Twist1),
Zeb1 (Zeb1), and Foxc2 (Foxc2; Fig. 4D). Thus, at the gene
expression level, Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutants display an
EMT signature.
Because of the association of PTEN/PI3K/AKT and RAS/
RAF/MAPK pathway alterations in human prostate cancer
progression, we hypothesized that murine prostate cancer
with concomitant PTEN and RAS pathway alterations may
closely resemble gene signatures of end-stage human prostate cancers. To test this hypothesis, we used RRHO analysis
to compare the overlap of differentially expressed genes in
human primary versus metastatic tumors from either the
data sets in the study of Lapointe and colleagues (22) or
Taylor and colleagues (2) with either Pb-Cþ;PtenL/L or Pb-Cþ;
PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutants. The heatmap signals on the bottom left (blue circle) and top right (red circle) corners
indicate that primary human tumors shared the greatest
overlap with Pb-Cþ;PtenL/L primary tumors whereas the
human metastatic data set overlapped more with the signature derived from Pb-Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutants (Supplementary Fig. S6A).
On the basis of previously published RAS signature gene sets
(33), several gene sets were noted to be altered to a greater
extent in Pten;K-ras metastatic lesions, similar to that of human
disease, as exempliﬁed by the downregulation of ﬁbroblast
growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) expression and enhanced
UBE2C expression, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme known to
be overexpressed in human prostate cancer (Supplementary
Fig. S6B; ref. 34). Together, these analyses provide strong
support of our hypothesis that the Pten;K-ras model closely
mimics the biology of human prostate cancer, especially
metastatic disease.
Pten loss and Ras activation cooperate to enhance stem/
progenitor activity
Recent studies suggest that EMT is associated with the
formation of breast cancer stem cells (35) and the progression
of prostate cancer (19, 36). To test whether RAS activation
induces EMT in Pten-null prostatic stem/progenitor cells and
consequently promotes prostate cancer progression and
metastasis, we characterized prostatic stem/progenitor cells
in vitro sphere-forming analysis. Our previous study indicates
that LSChigh (LinSca1þCD49fhigh) stem/progenitor cells have
high sphere-forming activity and are both necessary and
sufﬁcient for initiating Pten-null prostate cancers (26). Similar
to Pten-null prostates, the compound Pten;K-ras prostates
showed signiﬁcant expansion of the leukemia stem cell
(LSC)high subpopulation (Fig. 5A, left;  , P < 0.01, n ¼ 4) and
further enhanced sphere-forming activity (Fig. 5A, right,  , P <
0.01). However, different from Pten-null prostates, the LSClow
(LinSca1þCD49flow) subpopulation isolated from the compound mutants had signiﬁcantly enhanced sphere-forming
activity in free-ﬂoating conditions (Fig. 5A, right;  , P <

we isolated LinEpCAMlowCD24low cells from the above
mutants and found that only LinEpCAMlowCD24low cells (Fig.

signiﬁcant sphere-forming activity (P < 0.001; Fig. 5A, right).
Using real-time PCR analysis, we afﬁrmed that LSChigh and
LSClow subpopulations corresponded to the basal (Ck5, p63,

Psca), respectively, whereas the EpCAMlow/CD24low subpopulation corresponded to mesenchymal cells on the basis of the
heightened gene expression of Ar, Mmp2, N-cadherin, Snail,

was observed in the lymph nodes, lung, and liver of mice that
received Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W sphere cells. The metastatic
lesions maintained morphology similar to the primary cancers
(data not shown). Importantly, recipients of either Cþ;K-rasL/W
or Cþ;PtenL/L sphere cell transplants revealed no detectable
macrometastasis or morbidity by 10 weeks posttransplantation (data not shown), suggesting that concomitant alteration
of both PTEN/PI3K and RAS/MAPK pathways in stem/progenitor cells is required for the metastasis development in the
orthotopic transplantation models.

Pten Loss and RAS Activation Cooperate to Promote Metastasis

To further support our hypothesis that stem/progenitor
cells can reconstitute both EMT and metastatic phenotypes,
we FACS sorted the LSChigh, LSClow and EpCAMlow/CD24low
mesenchymal subpopulations from Cþ;K-rasL/W, Cþ;PtenL/L,
and Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutant prostates at 8 to 10 weeks of
age (Supplementary Fig. S7B and data not shown), followed by
orthotopic transplantation. Consistent with our previous studies, transplantation of Pten-null LSChigh cells could form adenocarcinoma (ref. 26; Fig. 6A, right) but without detectable
metastasis. However, in the recipients of Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W
LSChigh cells and EpCAMlow/CD24low mesenchymal cells, we
observed similar EMT and metastatic phenotypes (Fig. 6B).
PCR genotyping of resected metastatic lesions validated the
presence of Cþ;Pten/;K-rasG12D/W cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Therefore, both LSChigh and EpCAMlow/CD24low
stem/progenitor cells isolated from Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W
mutant mice have enhanced prostate capacity to reconstitute
EMT and drive distant metastasis compared with stem/progenitor cells with either PI3K activation or RAS/MAPK activation alone.

Pharmacologic targeting of RAS/MAPK signaling
inhibits metastatic disease initiated from stem/
progenitor cells
Because transplantation of stem/progenitor cells isolated
from Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W mutants yielded metastatic disease
with reliable kinetics, we investigated whether targeting of the
PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK signaling pathways could inhibit
such a phenotype. To noninvasively monitor metastasis in vivo,
we crossed the Rosa26-Luc reporter line onto the compound
mutant mice so both primary and metastatic lesions can be
easily monitored via bioluminescence imaging (BLI; Fig. 7A
and data not shown). We ﬁrst tested the ability of mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin (4 mg/kg/d, intraperitoneally) and MEK
inhibitor PD325901 (5 mg/kg/d, per os) to effectively inhibit the
PI3K and RAS pathways in vivo, using Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W
mutant mice. As shown in Fig. 7B, left, these small-molecule
inhibitors could hit their respective pathways in vivo, indicated
by the reduction of their downstream surrogate markers p-S6
and p-MAPK staining. Coinciding with efﬁcient reduction of
phospho-targets, we observed marked reduction of Ki67þ cells

NOD;SCID;IL2rg-null male mice were then orthotopically

primary disease and progression to lung metastasis, as indicated by BLI signals (Fig. 7C, left, n ¼ 10), mice receiving
combination treatment showed both reduced primary tumor
burden and little detectable signal in the thoracic region (Fig.

revealed that combination treatment signiﬁcantly abolished

test our hypothesis that RAS/MAPK pathway activation is
critical for the promotion of metastatic disease, we treated
transplantation recipients with only the MEK inhibitor. After 3
to 4 weeks of daily treatment with PD325901, we observed a
similar reduction in metastasis (Fig. 7C, n ¼ 10), although the
effect on primary cancers were less signiﬁcant compared with
the combination treatment. Together these data suggest that
the RAS/MAPK pathway activation, in collaboration with PTEN
loss or PI3K pathway activation, indeed, plays an essential role
in the development of metastatic prostate cancers and that
cotargeting both the pathways may be effective in preventing
metastasis or slowing down tumor progression.

Discussion
The study of molecular mechanisms underlying late-stage
metastatic prostate cancer has been challenging partly as a
result of the paucity of prostate cancer models that recapitulate
the multistep process of the metastasis. While alterations in the

PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling axis occur frequently in human
disease, such pathway alterations are not sufﬁcient to manifest
a signiﬁcant metastatic phenotype in preclinical animal models (3–5, 38). In this study, we identiﬁed signiﬁcant enhancement of RAS signaling in both recurrent primary tumors and
bone metastasis. In consideration of these ﬁndings, we evaluated the possibility that RAS/MAPK activation could serve as
a critical, additional hit to alteration of PTEN/PI3K/AKT
signaling in promoting prostate cancer progression and metastasis (Fig. 7D). Through coordinate Pten deletion and KrasG12D/W activation, we observed markedly enhanced tumor
progression compared with Pten deletion alone. Striking features
of Cþ;PtenL/L;K-rasL/W and Cþ;PtenL/W;K-rasL/W mutants included
the presence of EMT and signiﬁcant metastatic burden. Importantly, our study also showed that both LSChigh epithelial and
EpCAMlow/CD24low mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells have
sphere-forming activity in vitro and could reconstitute both local
invasive and distance metastatic disease in vivo.
EMT has been postulated to play a critical role in the process
of metastasis (39–41). Expression of EMT markers is correlated
with human prostate cancer progression as exempliﬁed by the
enhanced levels of the Twist (36) and N-cadherin (19) in latestage primary and metastatic diseases. Moreover, monoclonal
antibody targeting of N-cadherin signiﬁcantly delays progression in prostate cancer xenograft models (19). However, as few
preclinical prostate cancer models progress from invasive
carcinoma to EMT and metastasis, the functional signiﬁcance
and the pathways involved with EMT have been difﬁcult to
study. Using the Pten;p53 prostate cancer model (6), a recent
study derived lineage-speciﬁc cell lines which could metastasize upon orthotopic injection into immunocompromised
hosts (7). However, the interpretation of these ﬁndings is
confounded by the fact that primary Pten;p53 mutant tumors
rarely show extensive metastasis and that derived cell lines
may undergo in vitro adaptation or acquire additional mutations. Therefore, the new Pten-null;K-ras activated model
provides a unique opportunity for studying the signiﬁcant
impact of EMT in prostate cancer progression in vivo and the
pathway that regulates the EMT biology in the context of PTEN
loss. Because both K-ras and B-raf alterations occur in primary
and metastatic prostate cancer (2), it will be important to
model these alterations and determine whether these genetic
changes have distinct or overlapping roles in prostate cancer
development.
Cells with qualities of stemness and invasiveness have also
been postulated to confer greater therapeutic resistance, particularly, in recurrent disease (42). If true, then such a hypothesis would explain the relatively poor response that therapies
have toward metastatic cancers in comparison with differentiated primary tumors. Recent studies using breast cancer cell

lines treated with paclitaxel or 5-ﬂuorouracil, showed a 5-fold
increase in CD44þ/CD24low cells (43) whereas primary breast
cancer samples isolated from chemotherapy-treated patients
showed a 7-fold increase in the same cell population (44). That
the CD44þ/CD24low cells share a stem cell signature and
mesenchymal characteristics suggests that EMT may be
involved in the formation of cancer stem cells and therapeutic
resistance. In prostate cancer, such studies are far fewer in
number; however, the CD44þCD24low subpopulation isolated
from prostate cancer cell lines has been attributed to both
stemness and invasiveness mediated by EMT (45) and correlated with poor clinical outcome in patients with prostate
cancer (46). In our study, we have identiﬁed signiﬁcant expansion of EpCAMlow/CD24low mesenchymal cells that have
sphere-forming activity and can lead to the regeneration of
primary and metastatic lesions upon orthotopic transplantation. It will be interesting to test whether this is the population
responsible for therapeutic resistance.
Because our model is based on the coordinate loss of Pten
and Ras activation, we tested the effectiveness of combined
mTOR and MEK inhibition on stem/progenitor cell–mediated
transplantations. We observed near complete inhibition of
metastatic lung lesions in treatment cohorts. Previous studies
have shown that combined pharmacologic targeting of mTOR
and MEK may lead to reduced primary tumor progression (31).
Thus, to further test that RAS/MAPK signaling serves as a
critical step in the metastatic process, we also treated animals
with MEK inhibitor alone. Remarkably, using only PD325901,
we also observed near-complete abolishment of metastasis,
possibly as a result of impeding Ras-dependent EMT (Fig. 7D).
Collectively, our observations indicate that in Pten-null;Ras
activated prostate cancer, the RAS/MAPK pathway plays a
signiﬁcant role in metastasis.
