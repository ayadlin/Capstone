Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The bis-benzylidine piperidone RA190 covalently binds to cysteine 88 of ubiquitin receptor
RPN13 in the 19S regulatory particle and inhibits proteasome function, triggering rapid
accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. Multiple myeloma (MM) lines, even those resistant to
bortezomib, were sensitive to RA190 via endoplasmic reticulum stress-related apoptosis. RA190
stabilized targets of human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoprotein, and preferentially killed HPVtransformed cells. After oral (p.o.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) dosing of mice, RA190 distributed to
plasma and major organs excepting brain, and inhibited proteasome function in skin and muscle.
RA190 administration profoundly reduced growth of multiple myeloma and ovarian cancer
xenografts, and oral RA190 treatment retarded HPV16+ syngeneic mouse tumor growth, without
impacting spontaneous HPV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, suggesting its therapeutic potential.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Protein degradation is exquisitely regulated within the cell to maintain protein homeostasis
and eliminate misfolded or damaged proteins (Schwartz and Ciechanover, 2009). Targeted
degradation of regulatory proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is central to many
signaling cascades including those that govern cell proliferation and is exploited by many
infectious agents (Ciechanover, 1998; Ruschak et al., 2011). Typically, degradation of a
target protein is signaled by repeated covalent linkage of ubiquitin, as mediated by an E3
ubiquitin ligase. Proteins marked with ubiquitin chains, especially those linked via lysine 48,
are recognized by two proteasome subunits, RPN10 and RPN13 within the 19S regulatory
particle (RP) (Deveraux et al., 1994; Husnjak et al., 2008; Sakata et al., 2012; Schreiner et
al., 2008). The RP recycles ubiquitin by its removal from the target protein, which is
unfolded upon transit into the 20S core particle (CP) of the proteasome, where it is
degraded. RPN13 docks into the RP via RPN2 with its ubiquitin-binding Pru domain and
uses a nine helix C-terminal domain (Chen et al., 2010b) to recruit UCH37 to proteasome,
where it enhances its deubiquitinase activity (Hamazaki et al., 2006; Qiu et al., 2006; Yao et
al., 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The CP contains three catalytic subunits, β1, β2 and β5, with caspase, trypsin, and
chymotrypsin-like activities respectively (Schwartz and Ciechanover, 2009). Degradation
occurs processively via nucleophilic attack of the substrate amide bond by a Thr within the
β-subunit active site. Bortezomib and carfilzomib principally inhibit chymotrypsin-like
proteolysis (Bedford et al., 2011).
Bortezomib was approved for the treatment of relapsed MM and mantle cell lymphoma
(Bedford et al., 2011), and carfilzomib was recently approved for patients with MM
progression while on or after treatment with bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent.
Their efficacy has been attributed to the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and UPR
upon accumulation of protein aggregates, inhibition of NF-κB and TNFα signaling,
increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and stabilization of tumor suppressors such as
p53 (Chen et al., 2010a). In HPV-related cancers, the E6 viral oncoprotein drives
transformation by coopting the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP to polyubiquitinate targets,
notably p53 and PDZ-family members, for rapid degradation (Moody and Laimins, 2010),
and HPV-transformed cells are preferentially sensitive to bortezomib (Lin et al., 2009;
Schwartz and Ciechanover, 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Bortezomib induces thrombocytopenia and neuropathy associated with off-target activity
(Aratsu-Kapur et al, 2011), and the emergence of disease resistance remains a clinically
significant problem (Ruschak et al., 2011). Carfilzomib has similar issues. Additional orally
delivered drugs targeting distinct activities of the proteasome are needed to increase dosing
flexibility, overcome resistance and reduce side effects (Chauhan et al., 2005).

RESULTS
Activity of bis-benzylidine piperidone derivatives against cancer cells
We recently described a series of 1,3-diphenylpropen-1-one (chalcone) based derivatives
bearing a variety of amino acid substitutions on the amino group of the 4-piperidone,
including RA1 which inhibits ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation and preferentially kills
cervical cancer cells (Bazzaro et al., 2011). Their α,β ketone represents the minimal
molecular determinant for inhibition, which occurs without impacting CP activity (Anchoori
et al., 2011). To improve activity and solubility, and to probe their pharmacophore, here we
generated a series of derivatives with varying substituents in the aromatic ring to modulate
the acceptor character of the enone system including o- and p-halogens, and different amino

acids at the amine functionality of 4-piperidone (see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). Since our previous work suggested its importance for proteasome inhibitory
activity (Bazzaro et al., 2011), most RA compounds incorporated phenylalanine and/or
substituted phenylalanine. To overcome the poor solubility and pharmacokinetics of our
previous generation molecules, we employed an amide in lieu of a urea linkage between
amino acids and 4-piperidone. We synthesized RA166 and RA201 with chlorine and
fluorine at the ortho position of the aromatic rings and phenylalanine attached to the 4piperidone, and additional compounds in which histidine or tyrosine (RA213) are substituted
for phenylalanine, as well as RA181 with no substituent. Earlier studies suggested the value
of two chlorine atoms on each phenyl moiety and thus we synthesized RA190 and
RA190Ac, which differ in the phenylalanine and amide conjugation compared to the urea
conjugation in our early generation molecule RA1 (Bazzaro et al., 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Using a variety of cancer cell lines, cell viability was determined by an XTT assay after 48
hr treatment with titrations of each compound (Table S1). Activity against several cell lines
known to be sensitive to proteasome inhibitors was observed, including those derived from
cervical cancer (HeLa, CaSki and SiHa), MM (ANBL6, MM.1S, NCI-H929, U266 and
RPMI-8226), colon cancer (HCT116), and ovarian cancer (ES2 and OVCAR3) (Table S1,
Figure 1A and B). As RA190 consistently exhibited the most potent anti-proliferative effects
against MM lines (IC50 ≤0.1 μM) and HPV-transformed cells (IC50 ≤0.3 μM), it was the
focus for further analysis. RA190 was less efficacious against HPV− (IC50 >5 μM for HT3
and C33A, Table S1) than HPV+ (HeLa, CaSki and SiHa) cervical cancer cell lines.
Likewise, the HPV16-immortalized oral keratinocyte line HOK-16B was more sensitive to
RA190 than either HaCaT cells (HPV−, spontaneously immortalized keratinocytes) or FaDu
(HPV− head and neck cancer cells).
MM cells may acquire bortezomib resistance by several mechanisms (Kuhn et al., 2012; Ri
et al., 2010). We tested RA190 potency against two MM cell lines that developed resistance
after extended culture in bortezomib (Kuhn et al., 2012), and it was equally efficacious
against both the bortezomib-resistant derivative lines and the parental lines, consistent with a
mode of action distinct from bortezomib (Figure 1A). Furthermore, combination of RA190
and bortezomib provides a synergistic effect on the loss of cervical cancer cell viability
(Figure S1A).
RA190 triggers accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since compounds related to RA190 are proteasome inhibitors (Anchoori et al., 2011), we
examined its impact on the levels of polyubiquitinated proteins in HeLa and CaSki cells by
anti-K48-linked ubiquitin immunoblot analysis. RA190 treatment of HeLa cells (4 hr)
dramatically increased the levels of K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins similarly to
bortezomib (Figure 1C), and in a dose dependent manner. However, accumulated K48
polyubiquitinated proteins observed following exposure to RA190 exhibited a higher
molecular weight than seen in bortezomib-treated cells (Figure 1C) and occurred more
rapidly (Figure S1B). These results suggest that the toxicity exerted by RA190 for cervical
cancer cells is associated with a prior accumulation of high molecular weight
polyubiquitinated proteins and occurs by a mechanism distinct to bortezomib. Indeed, unlike
bortezomib, RA190 does not inhibit CP chymotryptic, tryptic and PGPH activities (Figure
S1C). Inhibition of RP deubiquitinase activity can produce a similar accumulation of high
molecular weight polyubiquitinated protein as seen for RA190 (Koulich et al., 2008).
However, the degradation of Ub-AMC by either purified recombinant UCH37 (with or
without the addition of RPN13), or purified RP was minimally impacted by RA190
suggesting that it does not inhibit the RP deubiquitinases (Figures S1D and S1E).

RA190 stabilizes tetraubiquitin-fused luciferin

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A tetraubiquitin-firefly luciferase (4UbFL) reporter, in which four copies of ubiquitin
(G76V) are genetically fused to the N-terminus of firefly luciferase (FL), is rapidly degraded
by the proteasome whereas FL alone has a much longer half-life. Importantly, treatment of
cells expressing 4UbFL with proteasome inhibitors results in its stabilization and an increase
in luciferase activity, providing a validated approach to assess proteasome function in live
cells (Luker et al., 2003). Two days after transfection with either 4UbFL or FL expression
vectors, HeLa cells were treated for 4 hr with bortezomib and luciferase-driven
bioluminescence was dramatically increased in cells expressing 4UbFL but not FL (Figure
1D). Thus the ratio of bioluminescence observed in cells transfected with 4UbFL versus FL
was used to assess the proteasome inhibition by the active compounds in the series,
revealing RA190 as more potent than others, including RA166 and RA201 (Figure 1D).
RA190 covalently binds to the RP subunit RPN13

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Removal of the olefin bond from RA190 by treatment with β-mercaptoethanol (forming
RA190ME) significantly reduced its potency in both cell killing and polyubiquitin
accumulation assays (Figure 1C, Figure S1F), suggesting it is a Michael acceptor with olefin
bonds that are susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Elimination of the enone moiety (RA190R)
or conversion of the carboxyl moiety to oxime (RA190O) dramatically reduced activity in
cell killing and functional assays (Figure S1F, see Figure S1G for chemical structures).
Furthermore, wash out studies are also consistent with RA190 acting as an irreversible
inhibitor (Figure S1H).
To identify its cellular target, biotin was covalently linked to RA190 via its free amine
functionality (RA190B). Biotinylation of RA190 did not affect its potency in cell killing and
functional assays (Figure S2A–C). HeLa cell lysate was treated with RA190B, subjected to
SDS-PAGE, and probed with streptavidin-peroxidase following protein transfer to a PVDF
membrane. The streptavidin-peroxidase bound to biotinylated cellular proteins, but a
striking new band at 42 kDa appeared in RA190B treated samples (Figure 2A). Importantly,
RA190 was competitive for this interaction suggesting specificity. RA190B bound to the 42
kDa protein in a purified RP preparation, and the interaction was similarly competed by
RA190 (Figure 2B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Within the RP there are four proteins (intrinsic ubiquitin receptors RPN10 and RPN13,
deubiquitinase UCH37 and shuttling ubiquitin receptor HHR23B) with a molecular weight
similar (37–45 kDa) to the cellular target of RA190. These proteins were over-expressed
separately in 293TT cells, and the lysates labeled with RA190B and probed with
streptavidin-peroxidase. Enhanced labeling of a specific band with RA190B was observed in
cell lysates over-expressing RPN13, but not the others (Figure 2C).
To eliminate the possibility that another RP component was required for RA190B
interaction, RPN13 or an irrelevant protein (L2) was over-expressed in bacteria. Cell lysate
harvested from bacteria either with or without IPTG induction of ectopic protein expression
was labeled with RA190B and probed by blotting with streptavidin-peroxidase. RA190B
reacted strongly with a 42 kDa protein only in lysates of bacteria expressing RPN13 (Figure
2D). Furthermore, this interaction was competed with by unlabeled RA190 and the presence
of RPN13 was confirmed by Western blot with RPN13-specific monoclonal antibody
(Figure 2E and F). These findings suggest that RA190 covalently binds directly to RPN13.
However glycerol gradient separation studies indicate that RA190 does not displace RPN13
from proteasome (Figure S2D).

RA190 ligates to RPN13 Pru domain

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RPN13 contains an N-terminal Pru (pleckstrin-like receptor for ubiquitin) domain that binds
to ubiquitin (Husnjak et al., 2008; Schreiner et al., 2008) and the RP (Gandhi et al., 2006;
Hamazaki et al., 2006; Ito et al., 2001; Schreiner et al., 2008) and a C-terminal domain that
recruits UCH37 to the proteasome (Hamazaki et al., 2006; Qiu et al., 2006; Yao et al.,
2006). We used NMR to determine whether RA190 targets a specific RPN13 functional
domain. Unlabeled RA190 was incubated overnight at 10-fold molar excess and 4°C
with 15N labeled RPN13, 15N labeled RPN13 (1–150), which includes its Pru domain,
or 15N labeled RPN13 (253–407), which includes its UCH37-binding domain. Unreacted
RA190 was removed by dialysis and HSQC spectra acquired to evaluate the effect of
RA190 on the three RPN13 constructs. The spectrum acquired on full length RPN13 after
incubation with RA190 exhibited significant signal loss for specific amino acids in its Pru
domain, but not its UCH37-binding domain (Figure 3A and S3A). Moreover, RA190
significantly affected NMR spectra recorded on RPN13 Pru domain (Figure 3B and S3B),
but not RPN13 (253–407) (Figure S3C). These data indicate that RA190 interacts with
RPN13 Pru domain.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

β-mercaptoethanol prevented the effect of RA190 on 15N labeled RPN13 Pru domain
(Figure S3D). To test whether RA190 interacts covalently with RPN13 Pru domain, we
compared LC high resolution mass spectra acquired on our 15N labeled RPN13 samples
with and without RA190 incubation (Figure 3C). Unmodified RPN13 was present in each of
the samples exposed to RA190 along with an additional species at a molecular weight
shifted by 561.4 Da for the full length protein (Figure 3C, upper right panel) and 559.8 Da
for RPN13 Pru domain (Figure 3C, lower left panel); the expected molecular weight shift
caused by RA190 attachment is 561.31 Da. Thus, one RA190 molecule adducted to RPN13
Pru domain.
RA190 adducts to RPN13 C88
We used site-directed mutagenesis and NMR to determine the site of RA190 ligation.
RA190 no longer interacts with RPN13 Pru domain when its four native cysteines are
replaced with alanine (RPN13 Pru C/A). 15N labeled RPN13 Pru C/A incubated with RA190
exhibited no changes in HSQC experiments compared to RPN13 Pru C/A alone (Figure
S3E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Inspection of RPN13 NMR spectra acquired with and without RA190 revealed C88 to be
significantly affected (Figure 3A and 3B) and we tested whether this cysteine is required for
the interaction. RA190 did not cause changes to NMR spectra recorded on 15N labeled
RPN13 Pru C88A (Figure S3F) and only one species of the correct molecular weight for
RPN13 Pru C88A was observed by mass spectrometry (MS, Figure S3G). By contrast,
RPN13 Pru C60,80,121A, in which only C88 was preserved, exhibited significant spectral
changes upon incubation with RA190 (Figure 3D) and a molecular weight shift of 559.9 Da
by MS (Figure 3C, lower right panel). These data indicate that RA190 ligates to RPN13
C88.
Model of RPN13 Pru adducted with RA190
We quantified the RA190 effect on RPN13 Pru by integrating the NMR signal of spectra
acquired on free and RA190-adducted RPN13 Pru (Figure 3B and S3B). The ratio of these
values was plotted for each backbone (Figure 4A) and side chain (Figure 4B) amide group.
This analysis highlighted RPN13 Pru amino groups that are significantly affected by RA190,
and was used to generate model structures of RPN13 Pru adducted with RA190 in
HADDOCK (Dominguez et al., 2003). The amino acids most affected by RA190 map to a
region opposite RPN13 ubiquitin-binding loops that includes C88. Despite its small size and

covalent attachment, RA190 addition to RPN13 led to signal loss (Figure 3A and 3B), which
suggests that it may adopt multiple configurations when adducted to RPN13. Our structure
calculations yielded four major RA190 conformations when adducted to RPN13 C88 Sγ
(Supplemental Experimental Procedures, Figure 4C, and Figure S4A–C). We selected for
visualization the lowest energy structure (Figure 4C), which was also most consistent with
our NMR data (Figure 4A and 4B). Rpn13 UCH37-binding domain abuts the Pru domain
(Chen et al., 2010b) and the region targeted by RA190 is within the inter-domain contact
surface (Figure S4D). An NMR spectrum from a mixture of RA190-modified and
unmodified RPN13 provides evidence that RPN13 inter-domain interactions are abrogated
by RA190 (Figure S4E).
RA190 causes endoplasmic reticulum stress

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum triggers the UPR,
which attempts to restore homeostasis by translation attenuation and up regulation of
chaperones. However when the UPR fails to restore homeostasis, it promotes apoptosis.
Proteasome inhibition creates endoplasmic reticulum stress by blocking the removal of
misfolded proteins, enhancing IRE1α-mediated splicing of the mRNA coding for active
transcription factor XBP1, one of the main UPR branches, and elevating expression of
Activating Transcription Factor-4 (ATF-4) and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP)-10,
both transcription factors driving apoptosis. Treatment of MM.1S and HeLa cells with
RA190 caused up regulation of ATF-4 protein levels and CHOP-10 and XBP1s mRNA
levels prior to apoptosis (Figure 5A–E). Bax is a critical element in the induction of
apoptosis by UPR, and RA190 treatment of MM.1S cells significantly elevated Bax protein
levels (Figure 5F). Conversely, UPR-induced cell death is typically p53-independent.
Isogenic HCT116 cells in which both alleles of wild-type TP53 had been eliminated by
homologous recombination, or HCT-116 cells into which mutant p53 was introduced,
exhibited similar sensitivity to bortezomib and RA190 as the parental line (Figure S5A),
consistent with p53-independent cell death in response to an unresolved UPR.
RA190 elevates p53 and p53-regulated genes in cervical cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

E6-mediated degradation of p53 and other targets via the proteasome is a hallmark of high
risk HPV types and critical to transformation (Chen et al., 2010a), suggesting that
stabilization of E6 targets and consequent pro-apoptotic signaling may account for the
greater sensitivity of HPV-transformed cells to RA190. However, combination of RA190
and bortezomib was synergistic (CI=0.4) for killing of HeLa cells in vitro, suggesting
distinct targets (Figure S1A). We therefore investigated whether RA190, like bortezomib,
could restore the levels of wild-type p53 in HPV-transformed cervical cancer cells (Lin et
al., 2009). Treatment of HeLa, CaSki and SiHa cells for 24 hr with RA190 elevated p53
levels as with bortezomib (Figure 5G, top panel). Rapid and time-dependent recovery of p53
levels was observed within 2 hr of RA190 treatment, reaching maximal levels by 6 hr
(Figure 5G, bottom panel). p53-targets p21 and Puma (Vousden and Lu, 2002), including
their ubiquitinated forms, were also increased in a time dependent manner (Figures 5H and
S5B). Treatment of HeLa cells with RA190 or bortezomib increased levels of pro-apoptotic
factors targeted by E6 for degradation (Moody and Laimins, 2010), notably Bax and Bak
(Figure 5H), and the tumor suppressor hDLG-1 in HeLa (Figure 5H) and CaSki cells (not
shown). Thus RA190 stabilizes multiple E6 targets (Moody and Laimins, 2010), including
pro-apoptotic and tumor suppressor proteins, through proteasome inhibition.
RA190 induces apoptosis and display of HSP90 on the surface of dying tumor cells

MM and HeLa cells indicate that RA190, and bortezomib trigger extensive apoptosis
(Figures 6A, B). Activation of ICE family members such as caspase-3 and -7 cleave PARP
to 85 kDa and 25 kDa fragments driving apoptosis. The ability of RA190 to trigger
caspase-3 activity (Figures 6C, D) and PARP cleavage (Figures 6E, F) in MM lines and
cervical cancer is consistent with apoptotic cell death.
Bortezomib treatment of MM cells elevates expression and surface exposure of HSP90 in
association with ‘immunogenic’ cell death (Spisek and Dhodapkar, 2007). RA190 treatment
of HeLa cells for 24 hr produced cell surface HSP90 on 54.2% of cells, whereas 12.8% of
bortezomib-treated cells and only 3% of control cells displayed HSP90, demonstrating that
this phenomenon is not restricted to MM cells. Notably, cisplatin did not induce surface
display of HSP90 suggesting that not all types of killing impact cells in this way (Figure
6G). A time course experiment in HeLa cells demonstrated initiation of surface HSP90 by 6
hr and strong up-regulation by 12 hr following RA190 treatment (Figure 6G), indicating a
similar time course to Annexin V-staining (not shown), and more rapid onset than for
bortezomib treatment.
Pharmacokinetics and safety of RA190

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Upon formulation in 20% (w/v) β-hydroxyisopropyl-cyclodextrin in water, mice were
treated with various single oral and i.p. doses of RA190. With i.p. administration of 10 mg/
kg RA190, peak plasma levels (Cmax) were observed in 2 hr, and then declined multiexponentially with distribution (T1/2, α) and terminal (T1/2, β) half-lives of 4.2 and 25.5 hr,
respectively (Figure S6). After p.o. administration of 20 mg/kg, RA190 plasma
concentrations rose rapidly during the first hour and then declined exponentially with a
T1/2, β of 2.6 hr. Based on the RA190 AUC values, the bioavailability of RA190 delivered
p.o. relative to i.p. was 7.2%. RA190 was detected in kidney (0.61 μg/g), liver (0.57 μg/g),
lung (0.66 μg/g), and spleen (0.59 μg/g), but not brain 48 hr after mice were given a single
i.p. dose of 10 mg/kg RA190.
To examine its safety/toxicity profile, mice were given three doses of 40 mg/kg RA190 p.o.
or vehicle alone every third day and euthanized on day 12. Blood was harvested and blood
chemistry and hematologic analyses performed (Tables S2). No significant difference
between the panels of tests was observed between the vehicle and RA190-treated groups,
except for a small reduction in triglycerides. The histopathology of the lungs, kidney, spleen
and liver was unremarkable in both the vehicle and RA190-treated animals. Similar studies
performed in mice bearing TC-1 tumors and treated with either RA190 or bortezomib also
suggest that RA190 has a promising safety profile (Table S3).

Proteasome inhibition in vivo by RA190
Naked 4UbFL reporter plasmid DNA was delivered either by gene gun into the skin or in
vivo electroporation in muscle (Figure 7), and the level of luciferase in the mouse was
assessed before and after drug treatment by bioluminescence imaging. To examine whether
RA190 was able to inhibit proteasome function in vivo, mice (10/group) were injected i.p.
with RA190 (40 mg/kg), bortezomib (1.5 mg/kg) or vehicle one day after intra muscular
(i.m.) electroporation with 4UbFL reporter plasmid (Figure 7A). At 4 hr after treatment,
mice treated with RA190 exhibited 4-fold higher levels of bioluminescence compared to
vehicle alone, whereas bortezomib elevated it only 2-fold. One day post treatment, both
RA190 and bortezomib-treated animals exhibited a similar 4-fold increase in
bioluminescence, suggesting continued inhibition of proteasome function (Figure 7A). The
level of bioluminescence observed in the vehicle-treated mice decreased steadily over 48 hr
suggesting a slow loss of transfected cells. At 48 hr after RA190 treatment, the mice still
show a significant increase in bioluminescence despite the short half-life of RA190 in blood

(Figure 7A), possibly reflecting slow regeneration of new proteasomes or the continued
presence of RA190 or active metabolites in tissues. Since papillomavirus infections are
typically restricted to skin and mucosa, the 4UbFL reporter plasmid was delivered into the
skin by gene gun (Best et al., 2009; Trimble et al., 2003). Similar stabilization of the 4UbFL
reporter was observed, albeit of shorter duration, suggesting that both RA190 and
bortezomib were also active in skin (Figure 7B).
Oral administration of RA190 increased the bioluminescence produced by mice transduced
with 4UbFL plasmid either intra muscularly (i.m.) by electroporation (Figure 7C) or in skin
via gene gun (Figure 7D). Again, the elevation of bioluminescence in skin was of shorter
duration than for the i.m. studies, possibly reflecting a more rapid turnover of skin cells, as
compared to transduced muscle cells of electroporated animals. Topical administration of
RA190 at 4% in Cremophor-EL also stabilized the 4UbFL reporter in skin (Figure 7E).
RA190 treatment inhibits tumor growth in mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NOG mice carrying an NCI-H929 MM line that expresses luciferase received RA190 or
vehicle 20 mg/kg/day i.p. daily for 7 days. Prior to and at the end of the treatment, mice
were imaged for bioluminescence. RA190 showed potent anti-tumor activity, even with a 3
day break in the middle of treatment (Figure 8A and B). We have previously described the
susceptibility of human ovarian cancer lines to proteasome inhibition. Nude mice carrying
ES2-luciferase tumor i.p. were treated with RA190 or vehicle for 14 days and
bioluminescence was imaged weekly. Treatment with RA190 significantly inhibited the ES2
tumor growth (Figure 8C and D).
C57BL6 mice carrying HPV16 E6 and E7-transformed and syngeneic tumor TC-1, which
spontaneously induces E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses, were treated with either RA190
(i.p., 20 mg/kg) or vehicle daily for 7 days, and the tumors harvested. Tumor lysates probed
by Western blot for polyubiquitinated proteins were dramatically elevated in the RA190
treatment group, suggesting RA190 can access solid tumor to block proteasome function
(Figure S7A). Oral administration to tumor-bearing mice of RA190 (40 mg/kg every third
day) significantly inhibited (p<0.001) TC-1 tumor growth as compared to treatment with
vehicle alone (Figure 8E). The final tumor weights after the 14 day treatment period were
1873±180 mg in vehicle treated mice and 727±101 mg in the RA190 treated mice
(p<0.001). Weight gain and the spontaneous E7-specific CD8+ T cell response did not differ
significantly between the vehicle- and RA190-treated mice (Figure 8F and Figure S7B).

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Bortezomib improves clinical outcomes for MM and mantle cell lymphoma patients, but a
significant fraction of patients are resistant or become resistant. This has driven efforts to
develop second generation pharmaceuticals with a distinct mechanism of proteasome
inhibition (Ruschak et al., 2011). The empty p-orbital on boron of bortezomib accepts
electrons from the hydroxyl group of a key active site threonine to form a pseudo-covalent
bond. Several epoxide or peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitors bind to the active site
covalently, but the reactivity of the aldehyde and epoxide groups towards non-specific
targets and consequent short half-life in vivo are important pharmacologic limitations
(Ruschak et al., 2011). Covalent inhibitors typically contain Michael acceptors that can be
more readily modified structurally to react selectively to target nucleophiles than highly
reactive alkylating agents. The bis-benzylidine piperidone RA190 is a Michael acceptor that
we have engineered over several iterations and it exhibits specificity against proteasome
ubiquitin receptor RPN13.

We show that RA190 adducts to RPN13 cysteine 88 in the ubiquitin- and proteasomebinding Pru domain, rather than the UCH37-interaction domain. Further, we have implicated
residues surrounding C88 as interacting with RA190, and found evidence of conformational
freedom in the docking site. Although C88 and the surrounding interaction surface of
RPN13 have been implicated in proteasome binding (Chen et al., 2010b; Schreiner et al.,
2008), we were unable to detect RPN13 displacement from proteasome by RA190. RPN13
binds sub-stoichiometrically to proteasome (Sakata et al., 2012) and exists free of
proteasome in cells (Hamazaki et al., 2006). In this free form, its Pru and UCH37-binding
domains interact, which restricts accessibility to the ubiquitin-binding loops and reduces
affinity of RPN13 for ubiquitin 26-fold (Chen et al., 2010b). Docking into proteasome
appears to abrogate RPN13 inter-domain interaction and thus promote ubiquitin binding
(Chen et al., 2010b). Our results provide evidence that RPN13 inter-domain interactions are
abrogated by RA190, which could therefore promote more promiscuous interactions
between ubiquitinated proteins and extra-proteasomal RPN13 as well as interfere with
substrate exchange to factors downstream of RPN13. Future experiments are needed to test
this model however.

To understand the pharmacophore of RA190, we evaluated analogs while keeping the basic
benzylidine piperidone skeleton intact. Substitution of L- for D-phenylalanine or conversion
of its carboxyl moiety to oxime reduced the potency of RA190. Elimination of Michael
acceptor properties by addition of thiol or complete removal of the enone moiety nullified
drug activity in cytotoxic and functional assays, demonstrating the importance of the enone
moiety.
Although the IC50 of RA190 is higher than the licensed proteasome inhibitors, oral
administration was effective. When formulated in 20% (w/v) β-hydroxyisopropylcyclodextrin in water, the oral availability was only approximately 7% that of the i.p.
delivery of RA190. While this suggests additional formulation studies are required for
RA190, it proved sufficient for significant anti-tumor effects and proteasomal inhibition in
vivo. RA190 was also effective via topical administration at 4% in Cremophor, suggesting
potential for treatment of HPV+ intraepithelial neoplasia for cancer prevention.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The mechanism of MM killing by licensed proteasome inhibitors via the induction of
endoplasmic reticulum stress, UPR- and p53-independent apoptosis is well documented, and
is also seen in response to RA190. This mechanism is potentially also active in HPV+
cervical cancer cells, but their relative sensitivity to RA190 compared to HPV− lines
suggests recovery of E6 targets is a factor. Indeed, stabilization of p53 is associated with the
expression of downstream mediators such as p21 and Puma, which arrest cell cycle
progression and promote apoptosis. However, an siRNA knockdown study did not support a
role for the recovery of wild-type p53 levels alone in bortezomib-mediated death of HeLa
cells (Chen et al., 2010a). Thus other E6 targets recovered by RA190, like Bak, Bax and
hDLG-1, may act in concert with p53 and UPR to trigger rapid apoptosis upon RA190
treatment.
Most cell lines of HPV− solid tumors were less sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, some of
the most rapidly growing with high rates of protein synthesis, including those derived from
ovarian and colon cancer, were more sensitive like HPV+ lines. This likely reflects a rapid
buildup of toxic polyubiquitinated protein aggregates seen in MM, termed aggresomes
(Hideshima et al., 2005), stressing the endoplasmic reticulum and triggering of the UPR
(Bazzaro et al., 2006; Bazzaro et al., 2008). Interestingly, frequent amplification of RPN13
has been described in both ovarian (Fejzo et al., 2013) and colon cancer (Chen et al., 2009),
suggesting a dependence upon the proteasome that may confer sensitivity to RA190 and
other proteasome inhibitors.

The side effects of bortezomib and carfilzomib, including neuropathy and
thrombocytopenia, remain important clinical concerns (Ruschak et al., 2011). Alternative
proteasome inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action are potential solutions. RPN13 is
one of two major ubiquitin receptors in the RP (Deveraux et al., 1994; Husnjak et al., 2008;
Sakata et al., 2012; Schreiner et al., 2008), and Rpn13 KO mice are viable suggesting that
RA190 may have a favorable toxicity profile (Al-Shami et al., 2010). Indeed, oral RA190
treatment was well tolerated, producing no significant difference in hematologic or clinical
chemistry parameters as compared with vehicle, and it did not impact weight gain or
compromise spontaneous anti-tumor immunity, further suggesting a promising safety
profile. Tumor specific cellular immunity is associated with better clinical outcomes but
most chemotherapies are immunosuppressive. That the spontaneous E7-specific CD8+ T cell
response to TC-1 tumor was not compromised by RA190 therapy is important given the
potential for such responses to help control HPV+ disease. Indeed, it may therefore be
possible to combine treatment of cervical cancer with RA190 and therapeutic vaccines
targeting HPV E6 and/or E7 (Welters et al., 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Clinical resistance to bortezomib often develops, and this has driven further efforts to
generate new proteasome inhibitors with distinct chemistry and proteasome targets (Ruschak
et al., 2011). While carfilzomib has a distinct chemistry, it also targets PSMB5, and
resistance has been associated with PSMB5 mutation and/or overexpression. RA190 was
synergistic with bortezomib for killing of HeLa cells in vitro, suggesting different targets.
With a distinct chemistry and target, RA190 can overcome at least some forms of resistance
to bortezomib as its potency remained in two bortezomib-resistant MM lines. Importantly,
while RA190 induces a similar buildup of polyubiquitinated proteins, the molecular weight
of the accumulated polyubiquitinated proteins was higher than for bortezomib.
Accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, cell surface display of HSP90 and apoptosis
occurred more rapidly upon treatment with RA190 than for bortezomib, consistent with
blockade of the proteasomal recognition of polyubiquitinated proteins and/or trimming of
the ubiquitin chains by the RP.
In conclusion, the ubiquitin receptor RPN13 is a promising target for cancer treatment.
Intriguingly, we note that RPN13 is amplified, overexpressed and required in both ovarian
(Fejzo et al., 2013) and colon cancer (Chen et al., 2009), suggesting its importance in cancer
biology. Given the issues of drug resistance, route of delivery and significant side effects of
the licensed proteasome inhibitors, RA190 may be complementary to, or advantageous over,
targeting the 20S proteasome subunit.

utilized at the concentration recommended by the manufacturer.
Enzymatic assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Reaction mixtures contained 500 nM of the purified 19S RP (R&D systems) in 19S enzyme
assay buffer and 1 μM Ub-AMC. Release of free AMC by the enzyme reaction was
determined by measuring its fluorescence at 380 nm (excitation) and 440 nm (emission).
The 20S proteolytic activity assays were performed as described in (Bazzaro et al., 2011).
Biotin labeling assay
Human cells (5×106 HeLa or 293TT cells) were lysed using 500 μL MPER (Pierce). E.coli
expressing RPN13 or L2 (500 μL culture) were harvested by centrifgation and re-suspended
in 500 μL BPER (Pierce). Lysates were centrifuged (10,000 g, 2 min, 4 °C) to remove cell
debris. Lysate supernatant (200 μL) was pre-cleared with streptavidin-Dynabeads (20 μL)
for 1 hr at 4°C, and incubated with compounds at 4°C for 1 hr. Alternatively, pure 19S RP
(R&D systems, E-366) (500 ng) in 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 15 %
Glycerol was incubated with compounds for 1 hr at room temperature. Samples were boiled
in Laemmli buffer, separated using 4–15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF
membrane overnight at 4°C (24 V). The membrane was blocked with 5% BSA in PBST for
1 hr, washed and probed with HRP-streptavidin (1:10,000 in PBST) for 1 hr at room
temperature. After washing, the blot was developed using HyGLO chemiluminescent
detection reagent (Denville).
Recombinant RPN13 preparation and NMR

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Human RPN13 full length, RPN13 (1–150), RPN13 (253–407), and His-tagged UCH37
were prepared as described (Chen et al., 2010b; Schreiner et al., 2008). NMR spectra were
acquired at 25°C or 10°C and at 850 or 900 MHz. RPN13 Pru~RA190 complexes were
generated by HADDOCK 2.1 (Dominguez et al., 2003) and CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). A
homology model of human RPN13 Pru domain was generated by Schrödinger based on
murine RPN13 Pru (PDB entry 2R2Y) (Schreiner et al., 2008). Ambiguous Interaction
Restraints (AIRs) were imposed to restrict RPN13 Pru active residues to be within 2.0 Å of
any RA190 atom (Dominguez et al., 2003).
Animal studies
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Johns Hopkins University. Nude, C57BL/6, Balb/c
female mice were purchased from the NCI-Frederick, MD and NOG mice were bred in-

previously (Trimble et al., 2003) or electroporation (ElectroSquarePorator 833, BTX-2
Needle array 5 mm gap, Harvard apparatus) delivered as eight pulses at 106 V for 20 ms
with 200 ms intervals. Bioluminescence images were acquired for 10 min with a Xenogen
IVIS 200 (Caliper, Hopkinton, MA) (Luker et al., 2003). C57BL/6 mice were challenged
subcutaneously with 5 ×104 TC-1 cells/mice and E7-specific CD8+ T cell response and
tumor size was measured as described previously (Trimble et al., 2003). Nude mice were
inoculated with 1×106 ES2-Luciferase cells i.p. in 100 μL PBS. At day 3 mice were imaged
for basal level luciferase activity. NOG mice (5 per group) were inoculated with 1×106 NCIH929-GFP-Luc cells i.v., and imaged for basal luciferase activity after 4 weeks.
Statistical analysis
Results are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was
calculated using Prism (V.5 Graphpad, San Diego, CA) as p≤0.05.

SIGNIFICANCE

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A greater requirement by cancer cells for proteasome function provides a therapeutic
window for bortezomib and carfilzomib by triggering endoplasmic reticulum stress,
unresolved unfolded protein response (UPR) and cell death. Bortezomib and carfilzomib
inhibit 20S proteasome activity and are licensed for the treatment of MM, but side effects
of thrombocytopenia and neuropathy, intravenous administration and disease resistance
suggest a need for alternative inhibitors. RPN13/ADRM1 encodes a proteasome ubiquitin
receptor and is frequently amplified in ovarian and colon cancer. Bis-benzylidine
piperidone, RA190, adducts cysteine 88 of RPN13, triggering rapid accumulation of high
molecular weight polyubiquitinated proteins, UPR and apoptosis. RA190 is orally
available, exhibits a promising toxicity profile and is active against cervical and ovarian
cancer and bortezomib-resistant MM cells.

(A) RPMI-8226, ANBL6 and their respective in vitro selected bortezomib-resistant cell lines
RPMI-8226-V10R and ANBL6-V10R were treated with the indicated compounds for 48 hr
and percent cell viability was measured by XTT assay and presented as mean ±SD. (B) The
indicated MM cell lines was treated with the indicated compounds for 48 hr and cell
viability was measured by XTT assay and presented as mean ±SD. (C) HeLa cells were
treated with RA190 (190), RA190ME (190ME) or bortezomib (Bz) for 4 hr (left) or 12 hr
(right) at the concentrations indicated and their lysates were probed with anti-K48-linked
ubiquitin antibody by immunoblot. An immunoblot of β-tubulin was used to confirm
equivalent protein loading. (D) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either
tetraubiquitin-fused firefly luciferase (4UbFL) or FL plasmids. After 48 hr, the transfected
cells were treated with various concentrations of the indicated compounds for 4 hr, and
luciferase activity was measured. Data is shown as a ratio of 4UbFL to FL and expressed as
a fold change ±SD compared to untreated cells. See also Figure S1 and Table S1.

Figure 2. RA190 binds covalently to RPN13

(A) HeLa cell lysate was labeled with RA190B alone or in the presence of competitor
RA190 at the indicated concentrations for 1 hr at 4°C. After labeling, equal aliquots were
boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane
and probed with streptavidin-peroxidase for the recognition of biotinylated proteins. (B) As
for (A) except that the labeling was performed with 500 ng purified 19S proteasome, 10 μM
RA190B (190B) and 100 μM RA190 (190). (C) 293TT cells were transfected with plasmid
expressing RPN13, RPN10, UCH37 or HHR23B, or luciferase as a control. At 48 hr posttransfection, cell lysates were labeled with RA190B (20 μM), separated by SDS-PAGE,
transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with streptavidin-peroxidase. (D) Lysates of
IPTG induced and un-induced bacteria transduced with expression vector for RPN13 or L2
were labeled with RA190B (20 μM), separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF
