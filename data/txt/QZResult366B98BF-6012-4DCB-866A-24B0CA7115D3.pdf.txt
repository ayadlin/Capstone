ABSTRACT
Obesity greatly influences risk, progression and prognosis of breast cancer. As
molecular effects of obesity are largely mediated by adipocytokine leptin, finding
effective novel strategies to antagonize neoplastic effects of leptin is desirable to
disrupt obesity-cancer axis. Present study is designed to test the efficacy of honokiol
(HNK), a bioactive polyphenol from Magnolia grandiflora, against oncogenic actions
of leptin and systematically elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our results show
that HNK significantly inhibits leptin-induced breast-cancer cell-growth, invasion,
migration and leptin-induced breast-tumor-xenograft growth. Using a phospho-kinase
screening array, we discover that HNK inhibits phosphorylation and activation of
key molecules of leptin-signaling-network. Specifically, HNK inhibits leptin-induced
Wnt1-MTA1-β-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo. Finally, an integral role of miR34a in HNK-mediated inhibition of Wnt1-MTA1-β-catenin axis was discovered. HNK
inhibits Stat3 phosphorylation, abrogates its recruitment to miR-34a promoter and
this release of repressor-Stat3 results in miR-34a activation leading to Wnt1-MTA1-βcatenin inhibition. Accordingly, HNK treatment inhibited breast tumor growth in dietinduced-obese mouse model (exhibiting high leptin levels) in a manner associated
with activation of miR-34a and inhibition of MTA1-β-catenin. These data provide first
in vitro and in vivo evidence for the leptin-antagonist potential of HNK revealing a
crosstalk between HNK and miR34a and Wnt1-MTA1-β-catenin axis.

INTRODUCTION

and 33% are overweight. Worldwide approximately 500
million adults are obese and 1.1 billion are overweight [1,
2]. Multitudes of epidemiological studies have shown that
obesity greatly influences risk, progression and prognosis
of various cancers including breast cancer [3, 4]. Results
from the Million Women study examining breast cancer
incidence and mortality in relation to obese state show
that approximately half of the cancers in postmenopausal
women can be attributed to high BMI [5]. Advanced

Obesity has emerged as a global health problem
with prevalence rates dramatically increasing in the
last two decades in the United States and many other
countries. According to WHO criterion for classifying
obesity [body mass index (BMI) <18.5 (underweight);
18.5-24.9 (normal); 25.0-29.9 (overweight); ≥ 30.0 kg/m2
(obese)], an estimated 36% of American adults are obese

grade and stage including lymph node metastasis are more
prevalent in obese women with invasive breast cancer
which partly explains why obese women in the highest
quintile of BMI have double the death rate from breast
cancer when compared with women in the lowest quintile
[6, 7]. In addition to being associated with postmenopausal
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, obese state
is also associated with ER-negative breast cancer with
high S-phase fraction, histological grade, mitotic cell
count, expression levels of proliferation markers, and a
larger tumor size [8].
Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipocytes,
typically associated with obese state, greatly alters
the local and systemic secretion of biologically active
polypeptides, adipocytokines such as leptin. Acting
by endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine mechanisms,
dysregulated leptin affect various oncogenic processes [9,
10]. High level of plasma leptin is linked with increased
risk and poor prognosis for breast carcinogenesis in
epidemiological studies [11, 12]. We and others have
established that high leptin levels (hyperleptinemia)
associated with obese state stimulate breast cancer cell
proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis,
thereby promoting breast tumor growth and metastasis
[13-19]. Given that leptin and leptin-signaling pathway
are prime targets for disrupting obesity-breast cancer link,
developing effective, non-endocrine, non-toxic agents for
prevention of the neoplastic effects of leptin are highly
important.
The importance of active constitutive agents in
natural products has become increasingly apparent
owing to their potential cancer preventive as well as
therapeutic properties [20, 21]. Traditional asian medicine
has successfully used cones, bark and leaves from
Magnolia plant species for their anti-thrombocytic, antiinflammatory, anxiolytic, anti-depressant, antioxidant,
antispasmodic, antibacterial and anticancer effects [2225]. Medicinal benefits of Magnolia species have been
assigned to honokiol (HNK), a natural phenolic compound
isolated from an extract of seed cones from Magnolia
grandiflora [26]. Previous studies from our lab have
shown that HNK inhibits breast carcinogenesis in vitro
and in vivo [27, 28]. In the present study, we specifically
investigated the potential of HNK to inhibit oncogenic
effects of highly-active leptin signaling pertaining to obese
state and examine the underlying molecular mechanisms.
Our in vitro and in vivo analyses show that HNK inhibits
breast tumorigenesis in obese state, inhibits leptin-induced
Wnt1-MTA1-β-catenin signaling via miR-34a activation
in a Stat3-dependent manner.

Honokiol impedes leptin-induced clonogenicity,
anchorage-independent growth, invasion, and
migration of breast cancer cells and inhibits
breast tumor progression in athymic nude mice
treated with leptin
Multiple epidemiological, clinical and preclinical
studies have shown the importance of adipocytokine
leptin in mediating the molecular effects of obesity [11,
12]. Recent studies from our lab and others have revealed
myriad oncogenic effects of leptin including induction
of growth, epithelial- mesenchymal-transition (EMT),
invasion and migration potential of breast cancer [13-19].
Here, we specifically examined if HNK could inhibit the
oncogenic effects of leptin on breast cancer growth and
metastatic properties using well-characterized human
breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDAMB-468 and T47D) as models. We first examined the
effect of HNK on leptin-induced cell-viability, clonogenic
potential and anchorage-independent growth of breast
cancer cells. Treatment with 5 µM HNK resulted in
significant (50-60%) inhibition of leptin-induced cellviability, clonogenicity and soft-agar colony-formation
(Figure 1A, 1B and Supplementary Figure 1). Next,
we investigated the efficacy of HNK to block leptininduced invasion and migration of breast cancer cells
using Matrigel invasion and spheroid migration assay.
Breast cancer cells exhibited augmentation of invasion
and migration potential upon leptin treatment which was
effectively inhibited with HNK treatment (Figure 1C, 1D).
We further investigated the in vivo physiological relevance
of our in vitro findings by evaluating whether HNK
treatment had inhibitory effects on the development of
breast carcinoma in leptin-treated nude mouse models. As
evident in Figure 1E, breast tumor growth was significantly
accelerated in leptin-treated experimental group in
comparison to the control group. Displaying noteworthy
in vivo efficacy against oncogenic effects of leptin, HNK
treatment reduced breast tumor growth in leptin + HNK
treated experimental group (Figure 1E). Ki-67, a nuclear
non-histone protein, is one of the major markers of
tumor proliferation [29] used as a decision-making tool
for adjuvant therapy [30]. The immunohistochemical
assessment of tumor proliferation showed higher Ki-67
in the leptin-treated group as compared with the control
group. Co-treatment with HNK and leptin exhibited
reduced levels of Ki-67 in comparison to leptin-treated
group (Figure 1F). Together, these results demonstrate that
HNK treatment results in effective suppression of leptininduced breast tumor growth suggesting that HNK is a
novel and effective leptin-antagonist.

selected proteins using phosphoprotein arrays. Breast
cancer cells were treated with 5 µM HNK for 6h and
subjected to phospho-protein analysis. We discovered
that phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt-S473)
and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β-S21/S9) was
significantly decreased in breast cancer cells treated with
HNK. In addition, expression level of total β-catenin was
also considerably reduced upon HNK treatment (Figure
2A, 2B, and Supplementary Figure 2). Previous studies
from our lab have implicated Akt-GSK3β and β-catenin
in oncogenic function of leptin [15, 31, 32]. We show
that leptin transmits signals via both MTA1 (metastasis
associated antigen)-Wnt1 and Akt pathways that cause the

phosphorylation, hence inactivation of GSK3β leading
to dissociation of GSK3β-Axin destruction complex.
Inactivation of destruction complex allows accumulation
and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, alteration of
responsive gene expression and ultimately induces growth
and metastatic progression of breast tumors in response
to leptin treatment [15]. Our finding that HNK modulates
Akt, GSK3β, and β-catenin, key components of leptinsignaling network in breast cancer cells, prompted us to
further explore whether HNK treatment can also inhibit
MTA1, Wnt1, β-catenin and cyclin D1 in the presence
of leptin. Treatment of breast cancer cells with leptin
exhibited striking increase in MTA1, Wnt1, β-catenin
and cyclin D1 expression in comparison to untreated
cells. HNK treatment efficiently inhibited leptin-induced
expression of MTA1, Wnt1, β-catenin and cyclin D1
(Figure 2C, 2D and Supplementary Figure 3). Given our
previous findings that nuclear translocation of β-catenin
is integral to leptin-induced gene activation [15], we
investigated the effect of HNK on leptin-induced nuclear
translocation of β-catenin. Treatment of MCF7 and MDAMB-231 cells with leptin showed nuclear accumulation
of β-catenin and co-treatment with HNK inhibited leptininduced expression and nuclear translocation of β-catenin
(Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure 4). Figure 2F shows
a schematic representation of leptin-induced β-catenin
pathway and the effect of HNK on this pathway.

on breast tumor progression in hyperleptinemic obese
state, we utilized diet-induced obesity model. High-fat
diet fed (HFD) mice exhibited a significant increase in
leptin level (ND = 6.1 ± 0.6 ng/ml vs. HFD = 35± 4.3
ng/ml) and increased body weight (ND = 18 ± 1.5 g vs.
HFD = 34± 2.2 g) in comparison to normal-diet (ND)
group (Supplementary Figures 5 and 6). Oral HNK
administration significantly inhibited the accelerated
breast tumor growth observed in HFD group (Figure 4A).
Next, we examined the effect of HNK on the expression
of important leptin-signaling molecules. Breast tumors
from HFD group exhibited elevated expression of MTA1,
β-catenin and cyclin D1 which was efficiently abrogated
by HNK treatment (Figure 4B). HNK treatment also
inhibited transcriptional upregulation of MTA1, β-catenin
and cyclin D1 in HFD tumors (Figure 4C, 4E). Tumors
from HFD and ND groups treated with vehicle and HNK
were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. Higher
percentage of tumor cells showed increased expression
of MTA1, β-catenin and cyclin D1 in HFD group as
compared to ND group. It is important to note that HNK
treatment inhibited the expression of MTA1, β-catenin and
cyclin D1 in ND group as well as HFD group (Figure 4D).
Collectively, the findings presented here show that HNK
treatment inhibits tumor progression in hyperleptinemic
(high-leptin) obese conditions and abrogate activation of
leptin-signaling molecules.

Honokiol administration abrogates leptin-induced
MTA1-Wnt1-β-catenin-cyclin D1 axis in vivo
and inhibits breast tumor progression in obese
hyperleptinemic state

Inhibition of Wnt1-β-catenin axis contributes to
HNK-mediated inhibition of breast cancer growth
Wnt1 expression is upregulated in various cancers
including breast cancer [33]. We previously show that
leptin induces canonical activation of Wnt1 signaling
through β-catenin-dependent mechanisms in breast
cancer cells [15]. Given our in vitro and in vivo results
showing that HNK inhibits Wnt1-β-catenin axis and its
important role in oncogenic function of leptin, we decided
to examine whether inhibition of Wnt1-β-catenin axis is
integral for HNK-mediated inhibition of breast cancer
growth, invasion and migration. We reasoned that targeted
inhibition of this signaling using a small molecule inhibitor
might be able to potentiate HNK-mediated growth
inhibition whereas treatment with purified Wnt1 might
interfere with HNK efficacy. Utilizing a peptidomimetic
small molecule (ICG-001) that has been shown to inhibit
β-catenin signaling [34, 35], we observed that combined
treatment of ICG and HNK resulted in further reduction
of growth in comparison to HNK treatment alone. Owing
to its oncogenic function [33], Wnt1 treatment resulted
in increased growth of breast cancer cells and Wnt1
treatment abrogated HNK-mediated growth inhibition
(Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 5B, HNK inhibited
migration of breast cancer cells which was additionally
reduced with ICG co-treatment while Wnt1 co-treatment

Our studies show that HNK treatment inhibits
leptin-induced breast tumor progression in vivo (Figure
1E). We utilized tumor tissue samples from the same
experiment to examine the effect of HNK treatment on
the expression and activation of important leptin-signaling
molecules. Tumors from the leptin-treated mice exhibited
increased expression of MTA1, β-catenin and cyclin
D1 in comparison to the vehicle-treated group. HNK
treatment resulted in effective inhibition of leptin-induced
MTA1, β-catenin and cyclin D1 (Figure 3A). Also, leptin
treated tumors showed transcriptional upregulation of
MTA1, β-catenin and cyclin D1 while HNK treatment
inhibited their leptin-induced expression (Figure 3B).
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that tumors from
leptin-treated mice exhibited higher number of tumor cells
showing increased expression of MTA1, Wnt1, β-catenin
and cyclin D1 as compared to tumors from vehicle-treated
group. Tumors from HNK+leptin treatment group showed
very low percentage of tumor cells showing expression
of MTA1, Wnt1, β-catenin and cyclin D1 providing
physiological relevance to our in vitro findings (Figure
3C). To further investigate the efficacy of HNK treatment

HNK inhibits Wnt1-β-catenin axis via
upregulation of miR-34a in a Stat3-dependent
manner

interfered with HNK-mediated inhibition of migration.
Wnt1 treated cells exhibited increased migration (Figure
5B). Effective inhibition of invasion of breast cancer cells
was observed with HNK treatment. Supplementation
of HNK with ICG resulted in more effective inhibition
of invasion of breast cancer cells (Figure 5C). Wnt1
treatment alone increased invasion of breast cancer cells.
Wnt1 abrogated HNK-mediated inhibition of invasion of
breast cancer cells (Figure 5D). Based on our studies, we
propose a model in which inhibition of Wnt1-β-catenin
axis is important for HNK-mediated inhibition of breast
cancer growth, invasion and migration.

In recent years, microRNAs (miRs) have been
recognized as important regulators of diverse biological
processes as individual miRs can repress multiple genes.
miRs are small (~21-mer) regulatory RNA molecules that
bind to the 3’untranslated regions (3’UTR) of specific
mRNAs and trigger mRNA degradation or translational
repression [36]. While several miRNAs have been
proposed to regulate various aspects of breast cancer
growth and metastatic progression [37], miR-34a has
emerged as an important tumor suppressor affecting tumor
cell apoptosis, proliferation, migration and invasion and,
importantly, is downregulated in aggressive breast tumors
[38]. We discovered that HNK treatment increases the

expression of miR-34a in breast cancer cells (Figure 6A).
It is interesting to note that leptin treatment decreased
miR-34a expression while HNK increased miR-34a
expression. Cells treated with a combination of leptin
and HNK showed a mitigated response to HNK (Figure
6B). These findings were validated utilizing breast tumors
from our in vivo studies. Analysis of breast tumors
showed elevated levels of miR-34a in HNK-treated
normal-diet (ND) group. Breast tumors from high-fat-diet
(HFD)-induced obese hyperleptinemic mice exhibited
lower miR-34a expression which could be rescued
with HNK treatment (Figure 6C). To further explore
the role of miR-34a in HNK function, we searched for
potential downstream target genes using (i) bioinformatic

algorithms (TargetScan, RNA22, and miRBase); and (ii)
analyzing the gene expression profile induced by miR34a from previous microarray profile studies [39, 40].
Interestingly, Wnt1 ranked high in the list of miR-34a
predicted target genes and we found a miR-34a binding
site at nucleotides 263-269 of the Wnt1 3’UTR (Figure
6D). We further examined the role of miR-34a in HNKmediated inhibition of Wnt1-β-catenin axis. Ectopic miR34a expression (in the form of a mimic molecule) further
enhanced HNK-mediated inhibition of Wnt1- MTA1β-catenin axis while expression of miR-34a-inhibitor
abrogated the effect of HNK on Wnt1-MTA1-β-catenin
axis (Figure 6E, 6F, 6G). These studies presented miR34a as an important node in HNK-mediated inhibition of

Wnt1-MTA1-β-catenin axis in breast cancer cells.
Our previous studies have put forth Stat3 activation
as an integral event in leptin signaling mediating oncogenic
actions of leptin in breast cancer [14]. As evident in
Figure 6H, leptin increased Stat3 phosphorylation while
HNK treatment effectively inhibited leptin-induced Stat3
phosphorylation. We also showed that high leptin levels (in
vitro and in vivo) resulted in reduced expression of miR34a (Figure 6B, 6C). A recent study reported a connection
between Stat3 and miR-34a where Stat3 directly repressed
miR-34a expression [41]. Analysis of miR-34a genomic
region showed a phylogenetically conserved Stat3-binding
site located in the first intron in close proximity to the
first exon (Figure 6I). Accordingly, treatment of breast
cancer cells with Stattic (a small-molecule inhibitor of
Stat3) inhibited phosphorylation of Stat3 and increased
expression of miR-34a, which was further increased
with co-treatment with HNK (Figure 6I). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that breast cancer
cells treated with leptin and IL-6 (used as a positive
control) showed increased recruitment of Stat3 at the miR34a promoter while HNK treated cells showed decreased
Stat3 recruitment. HNK treatment effectively reduced
Stat3 binding to miR-34a promoter even in the presence of
leptin (Figure 6I). Inhibition of Stat3 via si-Stat3 (Figure

6J) or Stattic treatment also potentiated HNK-mediated
inhibition of MTA1 and β-catenin expression in breast
cancer cells (Figure 6K, 6L). These results showed the
mechanistic insight underlying miR-34a regulation by
HNK. HNK inhibits Stat3 phosphorylation, abrogates
its recruitment to miR-34a promoter and this release of
repressor-Stat3 results in miR-34a activation. Collectively,
the findings presented here suggest that HNK inhibits
leptin-induced tumor progression and provide in vitro as
well as in vivo evidence for the involvement of miR-34a as
a regulator of HNK-mediated inhibition of Wnt1-MTA1β-catenin axis, and uncover a novel mechanism of HNK
action through inhibition of Stat3 leading to miR-34a
activation (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION
Exhibiting multiple molecular changes capable of
altering not only the tumor cell characteristics but also
various aspects of tumor microenvironment, obesity
is a complex physiologic state. Obese state results in
up to 2.12-fold increase in the relative risk of cancerrelated mortality [42]. Considering the pandemic nature
of obesity (approximately two-thirds of US adults are
overweight or obese), a 2.12-fold increase in relative risk

Figure 7: Schematic representation of the crosstalk between HNK and Stat3-miR-34a and Wnt1-MTA1-β-catenin
axes. Leptin treatment induces phosphorylation of Stat3 leading to increased recruitment of Stat3 to miR34a resulting in repression of

miR34a. Inhibition of miR34a allows increased levels of Wnt1 expression in the presence of leptin. Leptin treatment results in stabilization
and nuclear localization of βcatenin increasing activation of Wnt/βcatenin responsive genes. Honokiol treatment inhibits leptin-induced
phosphorylation of Stat3, releases Stat3 from the conserved Stat3-binding site located in the first intron of miR-34a hence releasing the
repressive effects of Stat3 and increasing miR34a expression. miR34a represses Wnt1 expression. Honokiol treatment results in abrogation
of Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway even in the presence of leptin.

of cancer-related mortality is a very significant medical
problem. Obesity-related changes include hypertrophy
and hyperplasia of adipocytes leading to adipocytokine
dysregulation manifested by high levels of leptin in obese
state. Leptin has been identified as a key member of the
obesity-breast cancer molecular network influencing
several aspects of breast cancer initiation, growth,
metastatic progression as well as response to therapy [1319]. Developing novel strategies to block specific biologic
mechanism(s) by which leptin contributes to breast cancer
progression and prognosis is essential for individualizing
care for improving outcomes among obese breast cancer
patients.
It is recognized that an ideal strategy to inhibit
oncogenic effects of leptin should be safe, highly
efficacious, and lacks toxicity through long-term use.
Leptin antagonism using pharmacologic agents, such
as soluble LRs (leptin receptors), synthetic leptinantagonists, and anti-LR monoclonal antibodies (anti-LR
mAbs) [19], although shown to work in certain conditions,
are not generally accepted. Given the importance of leptin
in driving obesity-breast cancer axis and the current lack
of effective, clinically viable leptin-antagonists, it is
imperative to develop novel leptin-antagonists that can
potentially be utilized for clinical use. The importance of
active constitutive agents in natural products has become
increasingly apparent owing to their potential cancer
preventive as well as therapeutic properties [20, 21]. Our
findings showing the ability of bioactive small-molecule
agent Honokiol (HNK) to effectively inhibit breast
carcinogenesis in a non-toxic, non-endocrine manner
[27, 28] render this agent of potential interest in the
treatment of breast cancer and spur our interest in further
investigating whether HNK is capable of inhibiting breast
cancer in obese hyperleptinemic state.
We show that HNK effectively inhibits leptininduced growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in
vivo. Importantly, oral HNK treatment also efficiently
abrogates breast tumor growth in HFD-induced obesehyperleptinemic mice. These findings provide strong
evidence supporting the efficacy of HNK as a novel leptinantagonist warranting further mechanistic investigations.
Therefore, studies are designed to decipher the key
nodes of leptin-antagonist function of HNK to facilitate
establishing surrogate biomarkers for its efficacy and
help in clinical development of this bioactive molecule
as a leptin-antagonist. Phosphokinase array studies lead
us to novel discoveries that HNK specifically inhibits
the kinase pathway previously revealed by our group for
its integral role in leptin function. Indeed, we recently
presented in vitro and in vivo evidence showing that
Wnt1-MTA1-β-catenin pathway plays an important role in
mediating oncogenic actions of leptin [15]. HNK inhibits
leptin-induced Wnt1, MTA1 and β-catenin expression in
breast cancer cells. These studies provide an interesting
mechanism by which HNK-mediated inhibition of Stat3,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in a concerted action, results in concomitant upregulation/
activation of miR-34a which is turn results in inhibition
of Wnt1. We also identify that Wnt1/β-catenin inhibition
is important for HNK function as co-treatment with
exogenous Wnt1 interferes with HNK-mediated growth
inhibition whereas ICG-001 potentiates HNK efficacy. In
vivo analyses of tumor xenografts from leptin-treated mice
and obese-mice (physiologically hyperleptinemic) provide
further evidence of the involvement of miR-34a, Wnt1MTA1-β-catenin axes. Based on these data, we propose
a model depicting a series of events including a feedforward interaction of pStat3 and miR-34a, where pStat3
acts as a repressor of miR-34a, and effect of miR-34a
on Wnt1-MTA1-β-catenin axis leading to its inhibition,
which is important in HNK function.
Our studies offer the first evidence of the ability of
HNK to activate miR-34a. This is an important finding
as miR-34a has been reported as a tumor suppressor
directly regulating various genes involved in diverse
cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration,
invasion and EMT in many cancer types including breast
cancer [43]. Recent studies have also shown that CD44
is a direct and functional target of miR-34a and enforced
expression of miR-34a inhibits cancer stem cells, tumor
regeneration and metastasis in prostate, osteosarcoma and
renal carcinoma [44-46]. Our in silico analysis supports
a previous finding showing that 3’untranslated region of
Wnt1 is a functional target of miR-34a in dendritic cell
differentiation [47]. Our previous studies have shown that
Wnt1 regulates MTA1-β-catenin axis in breast cancer cells
[15]. Here, we show that enforced miR-34a upregulation
indeed potentiates HNK-mediated inhibition of Wnt1MTA1- β-catenin axis while miR-34a inhibitor abrogates
effect of HNK on Wnt1-MTA1- β-catenin axis. miRNAs
are known to form negative or positive feedback loops
with the transcription factors they directly or indirectly
target allowing them to regulate multiple biological
functions in response to initiating signals. The miR-34a
also displays significant induction by tumor suppressor
p53 whereas it is repressed by Snail which itself is
downregulated via miR-34a [43]. We show a role of Stat3
in HNK-mediated activation of miR-34a where inhibition
of repressive effects of Stat3 brings about miR-34a
induction. Given the wide tumor-suppression activity of
miR-34a, several concepts including nanovector-miRNA
based delivery strategies of miRNA mimics have been put
forth for systemic delivery of miR-34a. Though attractive,
some of the concerns associated with nanovectors are low
payload, complexity of the physical state of lipid carriers,
and physicochemical stability. In light of these issues, a
bioactive strategy such as HNK which is effective as well
as non-toxic will have tremendous translational potential
as an activator of miR-34a in cancer cells.
In conclusion, we uncover a novel role of HNK as
an effective leptin-antagonist that inhibits leptin-induced
growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, which
16406

Clonogenicity and anchorage-independent and
cell-viability assays

involves activation of miR-34a facilitating HNK-mediated
inhibition of Wnt1-MTA1-β-catenin axis. We demonstrate
a negative regulatory role of Stat3 participating in HNKmediated activation of miR-34a whereby release of Stat3
from miR-34a promoter lifts the repressive effects of
Stat3. Our results thus demonstrate the integral role of
a previously unrecognized functional crosstalk between
HNK and Stat3-miR-34a and Wnt1-MTA1-β-catenin
axes. Considering the rising obesity pandemic and the
fact that ~100,000 cancer-related deaths/year are attributed
to obesity, our study demonstrating the efficacy of HNK
towards breast cancer in obese state has important clinical
implications and far-reaching impact. Although our
studies are focused on breast cancer, we anticipate that
the findings may apply broadly to other types of cancers.
Knowledge gained from these studies lays foundation for
future clinical studies investigating potential of HNK in
preventing breast cancer progression in obese state and
advances the field in a new direction.

To perform clonogenicity assay [13], breast cancer
cells were treated with 100 ng/ml leptin and 5µM HNK
alone or in combination as indicated for 10-days; colonies
were counted. Anchorage-independent growth of breast
cancer cells in the presence of leptin and/or HNK was
assayed by colony formation in soft agar [27]. Cell
viability assay was performed using a commercially
available XTT assay kit (Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, IN).

Invasion and spheroid migration assay
For an in vitro model system for metastasis, a
Matrigel invasion assay[31] was performed by using a
Matrigel invasion chamber from BD Biocoat Cellware
(San Jose, CA). The slides were coded to prevent counting
bias, and the number of invaded cells on representative
sections of each membrane were counted under light
microscope. The number of cells invaded Matrigel for
each experimental sample represents the average of
triplicate wells. Spheroids were formed following our
previous protocol [28] and treated with leptin and/or HNK
as indicated. After 48 hours of incubation, spheroids were
fixed with 10% buffered formalin in PBS and stained with
crystal violet. The migration of cells from spheroids was
observed under light microscope.
