BACKGROUND: Although convincing data exist regarding the prognostic utility of positron emission tomographic (PET)-computed
tomographic (CT) imaging in Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, its prognostic utility both during treatment and
immediately after treatment have not been systematically evaluated in a large mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patient cohort to support
its use in clinical practice. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine the prognostic utility of PET-CT
imaging in a uniform MCL patient cohort undergoing dose-intensive chemotherapy (R-HyCVAD) in the frontline setting. The primary
study endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). PET-CT images were centrally reviewed for the purposes of this study using standardized response criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with advanced stage MCL with PET-CT data
were identified. With median follow-up of 32 months, 3-year PFS and OS estimates were 76% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64%84%) and 84% (95% CI, 72%-90%), respectively. Interim PET-CT status was not associated with PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.9; 95% CI,
0.3-2.7; P ¼ .8) or OS (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.1-2.9; P ¼ .5). Post-treatment PET-CT status was statistically significantly associated with PFS
(HR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.0-13.6; P ¼ .001) and trended toward significant for OS (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 0.8-9.6; P ¼ .07). CONCLUSIONS: These
data do not support the prognostic utility of PET-CT in pretreatment and interim treatment settings. A positive PET-CT after the
completion of therapy identifies a patient subset with an inferior PFS and a trend toward inferior OS. Cancer 2012;118:3565-70.

INTRODUCTION
Dose-intensive treatment approaches and those that incorporate myeloablative chemotherapy with autologous stem cell
transplant (ASCT) are now largely considered to be the standard of care for fit patients with mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL) in the frontline setting. Whereas standard dose chemotherapy (CHOP  R: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone  rituximab or purine-based immunochemotherapy) results in a median progression-free survival
(PFS) ranging from 12 to 18 months, treatments such as Hyper-CVAD  R (cyclophosphamide-fractionated, doxorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone  rituximab alternating with cytarabine, methotrexate  rituximab) and/or ASCT appear
to significantly improve patient outcomes (PFS ranging 40-60 months).1-12 Recent large retrospective comparisons by
our group and the National Cancer Centers Network demonstrate superior PFS with dose-intensive treatment approaches
(compared with standard dose R-CHOPlike regimens).5,13 Yet despite the advances achieved with R-HyperCVAD and/
or ASCT, patients still commonly relapse over time, although some patients enjoy long disease-free intervals in excess of
10 years. Finding reliable prognostic indicators in that setting would be very helpful in the management of MCL patients.
Clinical models such as the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index were developed specifically to
risk stratify MCL patients for overall survival (OS).14 The cohort from whom this model was developed was based on 455
patients, of whom 33% received a rituximab-containing regimen, 18% underwent ASCT, and none was treated with
HyperCVAD. Validation of the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index has been reported with conflicting results. Both our group and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center lymphoma group were independently unable to validate Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index for OS and PFS in MCL patients treated
with R-HyperCVAD.15-17 Our research has therefore focused on the identification and validation of risk factors for failure

specifically in MCL patients treated with intensive
approaches. One such largely untested (but promising)
approach is the use of 18F fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
(FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) to identify
MCL patients with inferior outcomes who are thus candidates for novel approaches and research protocols.
Although MCL is reported to be an FDG-avid nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtype, PET-computed tomography (CT) is not currently recommended in the
modified international working group response criteria to
stage, survey, and assess treatment response in MCL.
PET-CT is however widely used for these purposes in
clinical practice.18 Although convincing data exist regarding the prognostic utility of PET-CT imaging in diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; post-treatment) and
Hodgkin Lymphoma (interim and post-treatment), the
role of PET in other lymphomas is still debated.19-27
Intriguing data have shed some light recently in follicular
lymphoma as part of the PRIMA trial subset analysis.27
Results showed that 99% of patients had PET-positive
disease at baseline and that negative post-treatment PET
correlated highly with superior outcome. Data in MCL
are still sparse; we therefore conducted a retrospective
cohort study to examine the prognostic utility of PET-CT
imaging in a uniform MCL patient cohort undergoing
dose-intensive chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

We conducted a 2-center (John Theurer Cancer Center
and University of Pennsylvania) retrospective cohort
study to test the association between PET-CT status and
patient outcomes in a uniformly treated MCL patient
population undergoing dose-intensive chemotherapy (rituximab-HyperCVAD / rituximab-araC/methotrexate)
administered in the frontline setting. The protocol was
approved by the institutional review boards of Hackensack University Medical Center and the University of
Pennsylvania.
Exposure of Interest

The exposures of interest were the subject’s pretreatment,
interim treatment, and post-treatment PET-CT scans.
Pretreatment PET-CTs were performed within 4 weeks
before the initiation of immunochemotherapy. Interim
scans were performed after 2 to 3 cycles of R-HyperCVAD (after cycle 1B or 2A). Post-treatment scans were
performed within 8 weeks of the completion of R-HyperCVAD. To meet inclusion criteria, patients were required
to have baseline PET-CT imaging and PET-CT
3566

performed at either the interim or post-treatment time
point. For this study, all scans were reviewed by 1 of 3
radiologists with expertise in nuclear medicine. Scan
results were dichotomized based on standardized response
criteria proposed by the Imaging Subcommittee of International Harmonization Project in Lymphoma.18 In addition, at each time point the concomitant maximum
standard update value (SUV max) was recorded at a suspected site of disease. To minimize bias, radiologists were
blinded to clinical outcomes at the time of PET-CT
review.
Study Outcomes

The primary endpoints for this study were PFS and OS.
PFS was defined as the time (in months) from the initiation of systemic immunochemotherapy to the time of
documented disease progression or death. Disease progression was defined based on the international working
group response criteria.28 OS was defined as the time (in
months) from the initiation of systemic immunochemotherapy to death. To assess for the primary endpoints, the
medical records were independently screened by 2 investigators, and agreement between reviewers was required to
assign an event. If the reviewers disagreed regarding case
status, the decision was arbitrated by a third investigator
(A.G.). In addition to consulting the medical record, the
Social Security Death Index database was used to confirm
death status and the date of death for all subjects. Patients
with documented disease progression or death or who
were lost to follow-up were censored from further
analysis.
Statistical Analysis

We first described the survival experience for the study
cohort using the Kaplan-Meier method. We then
described the survival experience for subjects stratified on
their PET-CT status at defined time points (interim treatment and post-treatment). Once the proportional hazards
assumption was addressed, the likelihood ratio (LR) test
was used to compare outcomes for subjects based on their
PET-CT. By using Cox regression, we performed a univariate analysis to identify potential predictors of survival
in this patient cohort. The variables included were pretreatment Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score, b2 microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), and PET-CT status. Variables significant in univariate analysis were planned to be selected for inclusion
in a multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of survival. All tests were 2-sided at the 5% level.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 9.2
(StataCorp, College Station, Tex).

RESULTS
Patient Population

A total of 148 patients were identified in our MCL
Outcomes Database with newly diagnosed MCL treated
at either the John Theurer Cancer Center or University of
Pennsylvania Medical Center between 2000 and 2010.
Of these, 93 patients were treated with R-HyperCVAD in
the frontline setting, and 53 R-HyperCVAD–treated
patients had PET-CT data available for review. Overall
treatment response rate was 92% (81% complete response
þ 11% partial response). Baseline characteristics of the 53
patients included in this analysis are presented in Table 1.
With a median follow-up of 32 months, 3-year PFS and
OS estimates were 76% (95% confidence interval [CI],
64%-84%) and 84% (95% CI, 72%-90%), respectively.
For the entire study cohort, median OS and PFS have not
yet been reached.
PET-CT Central Review

A total of 152 PET-CT scans for 53 patients treated
with R-HyperCVAD (42 John Theurer Cancer Center þ 11 University of Pennsylvania) were reviewed
for this analysis (5 patients did not have interim
PET-CT data collected or available for review, and 2
patients did not have post-treatment PET data collected or available for review). Pretreatment PETCTs were FDG avid in 92% of MCL patients, with
a median SUV max of 8.1 (range, 2.5-36.7) at a suspected site of disease. Interim and post-treatment
PET-CT scans were positive in 35% and 16% of
patients, respectively. Median SUV max for interim
and post-treatment PET-CTs were 3.2 (range, 2.025.6) and 3.1 (range, 1.6-32.7), respectively. Patients
with a negative baseline PET-CT were included in
subsequent analyses, because information regarding
the false-negative rate of PET-CT in MCL is
unknown.

Survival Analysis

Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression survival analyses were
used to test the association between PET-CT and survival.
Figure 1 depicts the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the
cohort based on post-treatment PET-CT status. Posttreatment PET-CT was able to identify MCL patients
with a statistically significantly inferior PFS (P ¼ .0002,
LR test) and a trend toward an inferior OS (P ¼ .08, LR
test). The median PFS and OS survival based on posttreatment PET-CT status (positive vs negative) were PFS:
11.1 months vs not reached and OS: 56.9 months vs not
reached, respectively.
On the basis of these results, univariate analyses
were performed using Cox regression to examine the utility of variables reported in the literature to be prognostic
for survival in MCL. Cutpoints for this analysis were prespecified before performing this analysis. In addition to
PET-CT status, we also included Mantle Cell Lymphoma
International Prognostic Index score (range, 0-11; low
0-3 vs intermediate 4-5 vs high risk 5-11), b2 microglobulin

(1.5  upper limit of normal [ULN] vs >1.5  ULN),
LDH (1.0  ULN vs > 1.0  ULN), and pretreatment
SUV max (6 vs >6).
We found that interim PET-CT status was not associated with PFS (HR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.3-2.7; P ¼ .8) or
OS (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.1-2.9; P ¼ .5). Post-treatment
PET-CT status was statistically significantly associated
with PFS (HR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.1-13.6; P ¼ .001; Harrell
C ¼ 0.70) and trended toward significant for OS (HR,
2.8; 95% CI, 0.8-9.6; P ¼ .07). Mantle Cell Lymphoma
International Prognostic Index score, LDH/ULN, b2
microglobulin/ULN, and pretreatment SUV max were
not statistically significantly associated with either PFS or
OS in this patient population. Because only post-treatment PET-CT was significant for PFS in univariate analysis, multivariate analysis was not performed. In addition,
achievement of complete response (vs partial response)
by international working group response criteria was not
statistically significantly associated with PFS in this cohort
(HR, 0.73; P ¼ .5; 95% CI, 0.25-2.2).
DISCUSSION
Over the past decade, the use and utility of FDG-PET
imaging in the management of lymphoma has markedly
expanded.18,29 Upon careful review of the literature, the
level of evidence to support this practice varies widely
across the spectrum of NHL and Hodgkin lymphoma
subtypes.18 Whereas in DLBCL (staging and post-therapy
FDG-PET),20,21,25,30-33 Hodgkin lymphoma (interim
and post-therapy FDG-PET),19,22,26 and follicular lymphoma (PRIMA data, post-therapy PET)27 there is a robust literature to support the use of PET-CT to identify
patients at high risk for failure, the data in other lymphoma subtypes are limited by the lack of prospective
data, the heterogeneity of patient populations/treatment
strategies, and most importantly, the lack of uniformity in
the way FDG-PET imaging is interpreted.
In the case of MCL, the most recent update to the
Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma justifiably
did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of
FDG-PET for staging, during therapy or after therapy,
outside of the context of a clinical trial. This recommendation is in part because of paucity of data and conflicting
results available in the literature.34-41
Karam et al found an association between pretreatment SUV max (<5 vs 5) at diagnosis and survival
(event-free survival [EFS] and OS).38 Similar results were
recently described the GOELAMS group, which proposed a clinical prognostic model based on pretreatment
SUV max (6 vs >6) and International Prognostic Index
3568

in 44 heterogeneously treated (57% underwent ASCT)
MCL patients.34 The model (not yet validated) is
reported to risk-stratify patients (low, intermediate, and
high risk) for EFS. Alternatively, Schaffel et al examined
the prognostic value of FDG-PET in 75 uniformly treated
patients treated with induction [R-CHOP ! Rituxan,
Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, Etoposide (RICE)] followed
by ASCT.40 In that data set, pretreatment FDG-PET
(stratified by median SUV max) was not associated with
PFS or OS.
In the Memorial Sloan-Kettering data set, FDGPET studies were performed before start of therapy (RCHOP 14) and before ASCT (post-RICE) and demonstrated that a negative FDG-PET postinduction (postRICE) was associated with superior PFS and OS.40 This
association was most pronounced in the subset of patients
with a partial response by international working group
response CT criteria with positive FDG-PET imaging. By
using international working group response þ PET criteria, Brepoels et al did not find an association between
PET-CT status (interim or post-treatment) and PFS in 37
heterogeneously treated MCL in the frontline setting.35
Our study is unique, as it is the first large series of
MCL patients treated uniformly with R-HyperCVAD to
examine the correlation between PET-CT and outcome
in the frontline setting.
There are several limitations to our study. Most
importantly, these data were collected retrospectively,
relying on existing records, which can result in a data set
that is less complete and less accurate. To address this, a
full time data coordinator (T.Z.) attempted to obtain
missing records, contact subjects lost to follow-up, and
confirm all outcomes using resources such as the Social
Security Death Index database. Not all subjects in our
database treated with R-HyperCVAD had PET-CT
imaging performed at the specified time points. To
address the possibility for confounding bias, we compared
demographic information (median age, sex, performance
status, and Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score) and survival outcomes between eligible
subjects with and without PET-CT imaging and could
not detect a significant difference in PFS (HR, 1.3; P ¼
.5) or OS (HR, 1.5; P ¼ .4), suggesting that the patient
populations are similar, and missing or unavailable data
are likely nondifferential. Our chart review suggested that
insurance regulations and physician practice style were the
most common reasons for lack of PET imaging and not
clinical differences in the patient population. In addition,
because the study cohort included patients who reached
post-treatment PET (presumably a select group of
Cancer

PET-CT and Outcome Association in MCL/Mato et al

patients who tolerated and responded R-HyperCVAD),
this would make the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the
cohort better than those derived from an intent-to-treat
analysis. Because our study population was treated at 2
centers, our findings may not be generalizable to other
centers and patient populations. Heterogeneity of treatment approach has been a major limitation in previous
work in this area. To address this issue, our inclusion criteria were limited to patients treated in a uniform manner
with a standard frontline approach. Since the data came
from 2 centers it allowed us to more closely monitor the
completeness and integrity of the data collection.
Although standard PET response criteria were used, and
images were centrally reviewed to minimize misclassification, we did not test for inter-rater reliability between
radiologists. In addition, because the data set comprises
patients from 2 centers over a prolonged time period,
small differences in the technical aspect of PET imaging
may also impact these results.
Our study has several strengths. To begin with, we
used established, objective criteria to define PET-CT
status. Therefore the patient population, treatment
approach, and response criteria are clearly defined and
hence reproducible for future prospective validation studies. Although >90% of PET-CT imaging included in this
analysis was performed at our centers, we obtained images
performed at outside institutions/radiology centers and
reviewed outside images for this analysis to minimize misclassification bias. In addition, our radiologist collaborators were blinded to the outcome of interest when
determining PET-CT status to minimize selection bias.
We chose a cohort study design to maximize analytical
efficiency.
Conclusions

These results build upon previous work, which has examined the correlation between FDG-PET and outcomes in
MCL. We conclude that that PET-CT performed after
the completion of dose-intensive immunochemotherapy
is an independent predictor of PFS, with a trend toward
predicting OS in MCL patients. Performing a midtreatment (interim) PET-CT in this patient population does
not have prognostic utility for PFS or OS and therefore is
not clinically indicated. Although MCL is reported to be a
universally FDG-avid NHL subtype, we found that 8% of
patients with biopsy-proven MCL had pretreatment
FDG-PET imaging that did not demonstrate FDG avidity at baseline. Therefore, pretreatment FDG-PET is recommended if this modality is used for risk stratification
after the completion of systemic immunochemotherapy.
This information should be incorporated into the design
Cancer

of future prospective clinical trials to validate these results.
We are currently examining the relation of novel computer-assisted quantitative FDG-PET/CT measures of
total tumor volume and total tumor metabolic burden
with clinical outcome in patients with MCL.
