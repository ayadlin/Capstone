Abstract
An inverse relationship exists between the consumption of garlic and the risk of certain cancers. The
present study was aimed at investigating the effect of garlic constituent diallyl trisulfide (DATS) on 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)–induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and tumor promotion in mouse skin and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Pretreatment of mouse skin with
different garlic-derived allyl sulfides showed DATS to be the most potent in suppressing TPA-induced COX2 expression. DATS significantly attenuated the DNA binding of activator protein-1 (AP-1), one of the transcription factors that regulate COX-2 expression, in TPA-stimulated mouse skin. DATS also diminished
TPA-induced expression of c-Jun and c-Fos, the principal components of AP-1, and blunted the activation
of c-Jun NH 2-terminal kinase (JNK) and Akt. Pharmacologic inhibition of JNK or Akt by SP600125 or
LY294002, respectively, resulted in diminished AP-1 DNA binding, reduced levels of c-Jun and c-Fos, and
inhibition of COX-2 expression in TPA-treated mouse skin. The JNK or Akt kinase assay, taking c-Jun fusion
protein as a substrate, revealed that TPA induced JNK- or Akt-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation in mouse
skin, which was significantly attenuated by DATS or respective pharmacologic inhibitors. Evaluation of antitumor-promoting effect of DATS on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene–initiated and TPA-promoted mouse
skin carcinogenesis showed that pretreatment with DATS significantly reduced the incidence and multiplicity of papillomas. Taken together, the inhibitory effects of DATS on TPA-induced AP-1 activation and COX-2
expression through modulation of JNK or Akt signaling may partly account for its antitumor-promoting
effect on mouse skin carcinogenesis. Cancer Res; 70(5); 1932–40. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
A perilous loop exists between inflammation and cancer
(1, 2). One of the well-defined molecular links between inflammation and cancer is the proinflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is a rate-limiting enzyme in
the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (3). The levels of COX-2
are transiently elevated in cells or tissues stimulated with different growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines, endotoxin,
and tumor promoters (4). COX-2 is aberrantly overexpressed

in various premalignant and malignant tissues (4). Mice genetically engineered to overexpress cox-2 are highly susceptible to spontaneous skin tumor formation (5), whereas cox-2
knockout animals are less prone to develop chemically induced skin tumors (6). Selective COX-2 inhibitors have been
shown to possess antitumor-promoting activities in different
organ-specific cancers including that of skin (7). As
evidenced by numerous epidemiologic and laboratory studies, targeted inhibition of COX-2 represents one of the most
pragmatic approaches to prevent tumor promotion (3, 4).
Topical application of a prototype tumor promoter 12O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces the expression of COX-2 in mouse skin (8). Mechanistically,
the expression of COX-2 in TPA-stimulated mouse skin involves excessive activation of intracellular signal transduction
pathways comprising proline-directed serine/threonine kinases and their downstream transcription factors (4, 8–12).
The 5′-flanking region of murine cox-2 contains binding sites
for various transcription factors, including NF-κB and activator protein-1 (AP-1; ref. 13). TPA has been shown to activate
NF-κB (8, 10) and AP-1 (9, 14) in mouse skin through activation
of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Of the MAPK
family members, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK;
ref. 8) and p38 MAPK (10) predominantly regulate the activation of NF-κB, whereas c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK; ref. 14)

and p38 MAPK (9) regulate AP-1 DNA binding in TPA-treated mouse skin. TPA also phosphorylates another upstream
kinase Akt, thereby leading to enhanced DNA binding of
NF-κB and elevated expression of COX-2 in mouse skin
(15). In the present study, we report that activated Akt also
transmits signals to the downstream transcription factor
AP-1 and regulates the subsequent expression of COX-2
in TPA-stimulated mouse skin.
One of the potential sources of chemopreventive phytochemicals is garlic, which contains organosulfur compounds,
such as diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), and diallyl trisulfide (DATS; refs. 16, 17). Among the garlic-derived
allyl compounds, DATS is the most potent in suppressing
constitutive expression of COX-2 in immortalized human
embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) cells (18). Whereas DAS and
DADS have been reported to inhibit chemically induced
mouse skin tumor promotion (19), the anti-inflammatory
and antitumor-promoting effects of DATS in mouse skin
have not been investigated yet. Here, we report that topical
application of DATS inhibits TPA-induced tumor promotion
and COX-2 expression in mouse skin, which seemed to be
mediated through blockade of AP-1 activation via downregulation of Akt and JNK signaling pathways.

Materials and Methods
Materials. DAS, DADS, and DATS (LKT Laboratories),
TPA (Alexis Biochemicals), LY294002 and SP600125 (Tocris),
and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and β-actin
antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.) were purchased. Primary
antibodies for IκBα, phospho-IκBα, ERK, p38 MAPK, JNK,
c-Jun, p65, and purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)–cJun fusion protein were procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. COX-2 antibody was from Cayman Chemical Co. Akt
and phospho-Akt antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. c-Fos antibody was obtained from Lab Vision. Lamin
B antibody and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antirabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased
from Zymed Laboratories. Oligonucleotide probes containing
NF-κB or AP-1 consensus sequence were acquired from Promega. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit and [γ-32P]
ATP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.
Animal treatment. Female ICR mice (6–7 wk) were supplied from Sankyo Laboservice Corp., Inc. and housed in climate-controlled quarters with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle.
DATS (5 or 25 μmol in 0.2 mL vehicle) and SP600125 (4 μmol
in 0.2 mL vehicle) were applied topically to the shaved dorsal
skin 30 min before TPA (10 nmol), whereas LY294002
(10 μmol in 0.2 mL vehicle) was cotreated with TPA. Control
animals were treated with 10% DMSO in acetone. All experiments were performed using three animals per group.
Western blot analysis. Dorsal skins of mice treated with
vehicle or TPA in the presence or absence of DATS,
SP600125, or LY294002 were excised and fat was removed
on ice. Collected epidermis was used to prepare whole tissue
lysate, cytosolic, and nuclear protein extracts as described
(11). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and im-

munoblot analysis was performed according to the procedure described earlier (11). Immunoblot membranes were
incubated for 4 h at room temperature with 1:1,000 dilution
of primary antibodies for COX-2, Akt, and JNK and for 12 h at
4°C with 1:1,000 dilution of primary antibodies for lamin
B, p65, phospho-JNK, phospho-Akt, c-Jun, and c-Fos. Immunoblots were then probed with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated rabbit or mouse secondary antibodies for 1 h
and visualized according to the procedure described previously (11).
Immunohistochemical staining. Sections (4 μm) of 10%
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin tissues from mice
(n = 3 per group) treated with vehicle or TPA in the presence
or absence of DATS (25 μmol), SP600125 (4 μmol), or
LY294002 (10 μmol) were subjected to immunohistochemical
analysis for detecting the epidermal expression of COX-2,
phospho-JNK, c-Jun, and c-Fos following the procedure described earlier (11). The quantification of immunohistochemical data was achieved by counting the positively stained cells
as percent of total epidermal cells from 10 microscopic fields
of immunostained tissues.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Epidermal nuclear
extracts were prepared from mice treated with vehicle or
TPA in the presence or absence of DATS, SP600125, or
LY294002 for 2 h. Oligonucleotides for NF-κB (5′-GAGGGGATTCCCTTA-3′) and AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAAC-3′) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with
nuclear proteins from different treatment groups. The DNA
binding of NF-κB and AP-1 was assessed by electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described (11).
In vitro radioactive kinase assay. The catalytic activities
of JNK and Akt in mouse skin treated with TPA for 2 h in the
presence or absence of DATS, SP600125, or LY294002 were
examined by in vitro kinase assay using GST–c-Jun as the
substrate protein for both JNK and Akt following the protocol
described previously (11). Briefly, epidermal extract (200 μg)
was immunoprecipitated with Akt (for Akt kinase assay) or
JNK (for JNK kinase assay) antibody. The immunoprecipitate
was suspended in 50 μL of reaction mix containing 47 μL of
1× kinase buffer, 1 μg of GST–c-Jun fusion protein, and 10 μCi
[γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30°C for 45 min. The kinase reaction was stopped by adding 2.5× SDS loading dye, boiled at
99°C for 5 min, and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 2 min. The
supernatant was separated by gel electrophoresis followed by
gel staining and destaining as described (11). The destained
gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film to detect the phosphorylated GST–c-Jun in the autoradiogram.
Two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis. Female ICR mice
were randomly divided into five groups, each consisting of
18 animals. Mice from groups II, III, and IV were treated on
their shaven backs with single topical application of DMBA
(0.2 μmol) dissolved in 0.2 mL of acetone/DMSO (85:15, v/v)
and animals in groups I and V were treated only with vehicle.
One week after initiation with DMBA, animals in groups II, III,
and IV were treated topically with TPA (10 nmol) twice a week
for 20 wk. DATS was applied topically at doses of 5 and 25 μmol
30 min before each TPA treatment to animals in groups III and
IV, respectively, until the termination of experiment at 20th

week. Animals in groups I and V were treated with vehicle
alone and DATS (25 μmol), respectively, twice a week for
20 wk. Tumors of at least 1 mm diameter were counted every
week until 20 wk.
Statistical analyses. Values were expressed as the mean ±
SEM of at least three independent experiments. The intensity
of different immunoblots was measured by using Gel-Pro image density analyzer, and statistical analysis was performed
by using Microsoft Excel.

Results
Topically applied DATS inhibited TPA-induced COX-2
expression in mouse skin. As an initial approach, the relative potency of DAS, DADS, and DATS (25 μmol each) in suppressing COX-2 expression in TPA-treated mouse skin was
evaluated. Pretreatment with DADS or DATS, but not DAS,
significantly attenuated TPA-induced expression of COX-2.
DATS was found to be more potent than DADS (Fig. 1A),
and its effect was dose dependent (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 1C) verified the pronounced in-

hibitory effect of DATS on TPA-induced COX-2 expression.
Thus, DATS significantly reduced the epidermal COX-2 positivity compared with TPA treatment alone (Fig. 1D). DATS
alone had no effect on COX-2 induction in mouse skin.
DATS attenuated TPA-induced activation of AP-1 in
mouse skin. One of the major transcription factors that regulate the expression of COX-2 is AP-1, which on activation
bind to the 5′-flanking region of cox-2 gene promoter (13,
20). Pretreatment with DATS negated the AP-1 DNA binding
(Fig. 2A) in TPA-stimulated mouse skin. DATS also diminished TPA-induced expression of c-Jun and c-Fos in mouse
skin as determined by immunoblot (Fig. 2B) as well as immunohistochemical analyses (Fig. 2C).
TPA-induced activation of JNK was abrogated by DATS
in mouse skin. The activation of AP-1 in TPA-treated mouse
skin often involves amplification of signaling mediated through
upstream p38 MAPK (9) and JNK (14). Although pretreatment
with DATS significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of
JNK (Fig. 3A), it barely affected the phosphorylation of p38
MAPK (data not shown) in TPA-treated mouse skin. The inhibitory effect of DATS on TPA-induced phosphorylation of JNK

was further confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. As
shown in Fig. 3B, pretreatment with DATS significantly diminished TPA-induced phosphorylation of JNK in comparison
with TPA treatment alone. Assessment of JNK activity by an
in vitro JNK kinase assay using GST–c-Jun fusion protein as
a substrate showed that TPA enhanced the catalytic activity
of JNK in mouse skin, which was significantly attenuated by
pretreatment with DATS (Fig. 3C).

JNK is involved in TPA-induced activation of AP-1 and
expression of COX-2 in mouse skin. To examine the role of
JNK in TPA-induced activation of AP-1 and expression of
COX-2 in mouse skin, we used the pharmacologic inhibitor
(SP600125) of JNK. Pretreatment with a topical dose
(4 μmol) of SP600125 abrogated TPA-induced phosphorylation of JNK as assessed by immunoblot (Fig. 4A, left) and

DATS inhibited DMBA-initiated and TPA-promoted
mouse skin tumorigenesis. The inhibitory effects of DATS
on TPA-induced COX-2 expression prompted us to investigate the effect of this organosulfur compound on mouse skin
tumor promotion. The onset of papillomagenesis in DMBAinitiated mouse skin occurred 6 weeks after TPA treatment,
which resulted in a 100% incidence (Fig. 6A) with an average
of 21.89 ± 1.16 papillomas per mouse at the 20th week
(Fig. 6B). Although DATS (5 μmol) did not affect the tumor
incidence, it reduced the multiplicity of skin tumors by
25.63%. Pretreatment with the higher dose (25 μmol) of
DATS reduced both the incidence (Fig. 6A) and the multiplicity (Fig. 6B) of papillomas by 22.22% and 71.08%, respectively.

initiation, animals were treated with vehicle or DATS (5 or 25 μmol) 30 min

pretreatment also attenuated TPA-induced Akt activity

phytochemicals provided one of the rational approaches for
molecular target-based cancer chemoprevention (7, 21). Garlic has been used as a food additive since the prehistoric time.
The oil-soluble fraction of garlic contains organosulfur compounds, which possess chemopreventive properties (16, 17).
Among the organosulfur compounds, DATS bearing three sulfur atoms and two allyl moieties exhibits the most potent chemopreventive and anticarcinogenic activities (18, 22–25). In
the present study, we examined the anti-inflammatory and
antitumor-promoting effects of DATS in TPA-stimulated
mouse skin with special focus on its underlying molecular mechanisms. We initially assessed the effect of DATS, at different
dose ranges, on TPA-induced COX-2 expression in mouse skin.
Based on our preliminary data, we selected 5 or 25 μmol DATS
as suitable doses for assessing its anti-inflammatory and antitumor-promoting activities.
Because aberrant expression of COX-2 is causally linked to
tumor promotion (12, 26), the inhibitory effect of DATS on
TPA-induced COX-2 expression in mouse skin delineates its
anti-inflammatory and antitumor-promoting properties. Our
finding is in good agreement with the study by Elango and colleagues (18) who showed that DATS suppressed the constitutive expression of cox-2 mRNA in HEK-293T cells. The
proximal promoter region of COX-2 gene contains a canonical TATA box and various consensus sequences for interacting with a variety of transcription factors, including
NF-κB and AP-1 (13, 20). Although DATS inhibited the
activation of AP-1, it barely blocked the DNA binding and
nuclear localization of NF-κB in TPA-treated mouse skin.5
However, DATS has been reported to inhibit NF-κB activation in cultured cells in vitro (24). Although it is generally
considered that the nuclear translocation and DNA
binding of NF-κB are critical events for the induction of
NF-κB–dependent gene expression (27), several other

Antitumor Promotion with DATS in Mouse Skin

studies have shown that the downregulation of NF-κB DNA
binding is not necessarily associated with its reduced
transcriptional activity (28, 29). Moreover, the efficient
transcriptional activation of NF-κB depends on the phosphorylation of its active subunit p65/RelA (30). Thus, it
is worthwhile to further investigate the effects of DATS
on the phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of
NF-κB in TPA-stimulated mouse skin.
In addition to the inhibition of AP-1 DNA binding, the
downregulation of TPA-induced c-Jun and c-Fos expression
suggests AP-1 as one of the molecular targets of DATS in attenuating inflammation. Because certain organosulfur compounds have been found to directly interact with free
sulfhydryl groups (31), DATS may modify critical cysteine
residues present in the DNA binding domains of c-Jun and
c-Fos, thereby inactivating AP-1.
It has been reported that the activation of AP-1 and expression of COX-2 in TPA-treated mouse skin are regulated
by various upstream kinases, including p38 MAPK (9) and
JNK (14). In accordance with our previous report (14), the
present study further confirmed the role of JNK in regulating
AP-1 activation and COX-2 expression in mouse skin treated
with TPA. Although DATS failed to modulate TPA-induced
p38 MAPK activation (data not shown), the compound significantly attenuated the phosphorylation and the catalytic activity of JNK in TPA-stimulated mouse skin. In contrast,
DATS induces apoptosis in various cancer cells through upregulation of JNK (32, 33).
Recent reports have shown that Akt, another upstream kinase, regulates COX-2 expression in various cells in culture and
in animal studies (34, 35). The significant decrease in TPAinduced COX-2 expression in female ICR mouse skin treated
with LY294002 agrees with our previous study showing
that pharmacologic inhibition of Akt abrogated TPAinduced COX-2 expression in male HR-1 hairless mouse skin
(15). Our findings that the pharmacologic inhibition of Akt abrogated the DNA binding of AP-1, the expression of c-Jun and
c-Fos, and the level of COX-2 suggest that Akt functions as an
upstream signaling molecule to activate AP-1 and induce COX2 in TPA-stimulated mouse skin. The inhibition of Akt-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun in TPA-treated mouse skin by
DATS, therefore, supports the notion that the compound inhibits TPA-induced AP-1 activation and COX-2 expression in
mouse skin by blocking the Akt signaling. DATS also induced
apoptosis in human prostate cancer PC-3 and DU-145 cells
through inactivation of Akt (36). Therefore, Akt may act as a
potential upstream target for antiproliferative as well as antiinflammatory and antitumor-promoting activities of DATS.
In the present study, SP600125 and LY294002 were applied to
mouse skin following a pretreatment and cotreatment protocol,
respectively. According to our previous studies, pretreatment

with SP600125 (14), but not with LY294002 (37), significantly attenuated TPA-induced COX-2 expression in mouse skin. We
therefore examined if cotreatment with LY294002 may have
any effect on TPA-induced AP-1 activation and COX-2 expression. We found that cotreatment with LY294002 not only downregulated Akt phosphorylation but also attenuated the activity
of Akt kinase, with subsequent inhibition of AP-1 activation and
COX-2 expression in TPA-stimulated mouse skin.
Several studies have shown the involvement of Akt (38, 39)
and JNK (14, 40) in TPA-induced AP-1 activation. Our findings
that JNK and Akt regulate TPA-induced AP-1 activation in
mouse skin in vivo and that DATS inhibits both JNK- and
Akt-mediated AP-1 activation suggest a possible cross talk between the JNK and Akt signaling pathways in TPA-treated
mouse skin. Whereas JNK has been reported to act downstream
of Akt (41), our study shows no such inhibitory effect of
LY294002 or SP600125 on the phosphorylation of JNK or
Akt, respectively (data not shown), suggesting that TPAinduced JNK or Akt signaling converges independently on the
downstream transcription factor AP-1 in mouse skin. In line
with our observation, Beales and Ogunwobi (42) showed that
pharmacologic inhibition of either JNK or Akt failed to inhibit
the phosphorylation of Akt or JNK, respectively, in glycineextended gastrin-stimulated human colon cancer (HT-29) cells.
The inhibition of COX-2 expression or activity is critical for
not only alleviating inflammation but also preventing tumor
promotion (4, 21). Thus, the inhibitory effects of DATS on
TPA-induced COX-2 expression may account for its antitumorpromoting potential in mouse skin in vivo. The significant
decrease in the incidence and the multiplicity of papillomas
in DMBA-initiated and TPA-promoted mouse skin suggest
DATS as a potential cancer chemopreventive agent. In conclusion, DATS suppressed TPA-induced expression of COX-2 by
inactivating AP-1 via blockade of upstream JNK and Akt signaling pathways, which provides a mechanistic basis of antiinflammatory and antitumor-promoting activities of DATS in
mouse skin in vivo.
