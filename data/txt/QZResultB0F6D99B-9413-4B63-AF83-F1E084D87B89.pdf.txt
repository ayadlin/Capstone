Abstract
Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with distinct
histologic subtypes. Targeted therapies such as endocrine
therapy and growth factor receptor inhibitors have had a significant impact on the treatment of metastatic breast cancer
patients. Unfortunately, resistance to these agents eventually
occurs, and currently represents a significant clinical problem
in the management of breast cancers. Inhibitors of histone
deacetylases (HDACi) exhibit anticancer activity in a variety
of tumor cell models and have been shown to target mechanisms of resistance to a number of targeted agents. It is unclear, however, if there are specific breast cancer subtypes
for which an HDACi may be more or less effective. Here, we
report that the class I isoform–selective HDACi entinostat
(SNDX-275) preferentially inhibits cell proliferation/survival
and inactivates downstream signaling in erbB2-overexpressing compared with basal breast cancer cells. SNDX-275
reduces the levels of both erbB2 and erbB3, as well as significantly decreases P-erbB2, P-erbB3, P-Akt, and P-MAPK in
erbB2-overexpressing cells. Additionally, SNDX-275 promotes
apoptosis and induces cell cycle arrest predominantly at G1
phase in erbB2-overexpressing cells, whereas SNDX-275 mainly induces G2-M arrest in basal breast cancer cells. The cellular bias of SNDX-275 is shown to be related partly to the levels
of erbB3 expression that directly impact the ability of SNDX275 to inhibit proliferation/survival of the erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. These findings show that SNDX-275
may be developed as a novel therapeutic agent to treat breast
cancers with coexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3. [Cancer

Introduction
Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with distinct
histologic subtypes. Gene microarray-profiling studies of invasive
breast carcinomas have identified five distinct subtypes [luminal A,
luminal B, erbB2-overexpressing, basal (or “triple negative”), and
normal breast like] that are associated with different clinical outcomes (1–3). Although luminal A and normal breast-like subtypes
have a better prognosis, erbB2-overexpressing and basal breast
cancers have the least favorable prognosis. Recent advances in
our understanding of breast cancer biology have led to improved
patient survival with target therapies, for example, antiestrogen
agents (tamoxifen) in the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)–

positive breast cancers (4); anti-erbB2 antibody (trastuzumab or
Herceptin) for breast cancer patients with erbB2 amplification and/
or overexpression (5). Trastuzumab has been successfully used
in metastatic breast cancer patients with erbB2-overexpressing
tumors as monotherapy (6) and in combination with chemother‐
apy (5, 7); however, both primary and acquired resistances to trastuzumab are common (8), and currently represent a significant
clinical problem. It is critical to explore novel therapies targeting
erbB receptors for breast cancer treatment.
Alterations in chromatin structure by histone modification play
a vital role in regulation of gene transcription. Acetylation of core
nucleosomal histones is regulated by the opposing behaviors of
histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDAC; refs.
9, 10). Studies indicate that deregulation of acetylation and deacetylation plays an important role in aberrant gene expression in human cancers (11, 12). Although targeting any component, such as
DNA, transcription factor, or modifying enzyme, which contributes
to aberrant gene expression in tumorigenesis might be a good therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment, HDACs represent relatively
easier tractable enzymes. Thus, HDACs have recently become
promising molecular targets, and a variety of inhibitors of HDACs
are actively under investigation as potential anticancer agents
(13, 14). HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have been found to possess anticancer activity in a variety of tumor cell models via influencing cell
cycle progression, apoptosis, differentiation, and tumor angiogenesis (15, 16).
HDACis, differing in respect to their antitumor activity, toxicity,
stability, and specificity, can be divided into several structural classes (15, 17, 18). SNDX-275 (entinostat; formerly MS-275) is a synthetic benzamide derivative class I–selective HDACi. It inhibits
cancer cell growth accompanied by an induction of the cyclindependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21waf1, which is one of the most
commonly induced genes by HDACi (19). SNDX-275 exhibits both
in vitro and in vivo activities against various cancer types, including
colorectal, lung, ovary, and pancreatic cancers (20), pediatric solid
tumors (21), leukemia (20, 22–24), and prostate cancer (25). In
breast cancer, SNDX-275 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and/or promote apoptosis by up-regulating expression of
transforming growth factor β type II receptor (26, 27) or tumor
necrosis factor-α–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (28, 29), or inducing degradation of DNA methyltransferase I (30). Thus far, little
is known about the specificity of an HDACi against breast cancer
subtypes. A recent report indicates that class II HDACis may exert
particular antiproliferative effects in ER positive breast cancer cells
(31). However, there is no report indicating whether SNDX-275 has
any preference against different subtypes of breast cancers, and it
is unclear whether SNDX-275 might target erbB receptors, such as
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), erbB2, and erbB3, in
breast cancer cells. In the current studies, we have investigated
the potential therapeutic efficacy of SNDX-275 on erbB2-overexpressing and basal breast cancer cells, focusing on the effects of

SNDX-275 on the activation and expression of erbB receptors and
their downstream signaling pathways.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies. MISSION Nontarget shRNA, which does not
target human and mouse genes, control vector (pLKO.1-ConshRNA), was
obtained from Sigma Co. The lentiviral vector pLKO.1-puro containing a
human-specific erbB3 shRNA (pLKO.1-ErbB3shRNA) and lentivirus packaging plasmids pCMV-VSVG and pCMV-ΔA.9 were kindly provided by
Dr. Haihua Gu (Department of Pathology, University of Colorado Denver
School of Medicine, Aurora, CO). SNDX-275 (N-(2-Aminophenyl)-4[N-(pyridine-3-ylmethoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl]benzamide) was provided
by Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., dissolved in DMSO to make a 20 mmol/L
stock solution, and stored at −20°C.
Antibodies were obtained as follows: erbB2 (EMD Chemicals, Inc.); erbB3
and P-erbB2 (LabVision Corp.); P-erbB3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3,
P-MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), P-Akt (Ser473), Akt,
Acetyl-Histone H3, Histone H3, HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.); CyclinD1, E2F1, and p21waf1 p27kip1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) monoclonal antibody
(BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc.); and EGFR, P-EGFR (Tyr1068), and
β-actin (Sigma Co.). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Co.
unless otherwise specified.
Cells and cell culture. The human breast cancer cell lines SKBR3,
BT474, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, BT20, and MDA-MB-231 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HEK293T human
embryonic kidney cells were kindly provided by Dr. Haihua Gu. All cells
were maintained in DMEM: Nutrient Mix F-12 (D-MEM/F-12 1:1; Invitrogen
Corp.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen Corp.).
All cell lines were cultured in a 37°C humidified atmosphere containing
95% air and 5% CO2 and were split twice a week.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, reverse transcription-PCR, and
cDNA cloning. Total RNA was extracted from SKBR3 cells using TRIZOL
(Invitrogen Corp.). First strand of cDNA was generated using AMV Reverse
Transcriptase (Promega Corp.), and the entire coding sequence of human
erbB3 was amplified by PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase
(New England BioLabs, Inc.) with the primer set: forward primer 5′-ATAGTCGACATGAGGGCGAACGACGCTC-3′; reverse primer 5′-GCGGGTACCTTACGTTCTCTGGGCATTA-3′. The amplified fragments were purified and
digested with Sal I and Kpn I (New England BioLabs, Inc.), and inserted into
the mammalian expression vector pDsRed-Monimer-N1 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) using Quick Ligation kit (New England BioLabs, Inc.). After verification by DNA sequencing, the recombinant with accurate sequence of
human erbB3 cDNA was nominated as pDsRed-erbB3.
Production of lentivirus containing specific shRNA. The lentiviral
vector pLKO.1-ConshRNA or pLKO.1-ErbB3shRNA and packaging plasmids
pCMV-VSVG and pCMV-ΔA.9 were cotransfected into 293T cells using FuGENE-6 (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). After 24 h, the culture media were replaced with fresh DMEM/F12 medium. The virus in conditioned medium
were harvested in 3 consecutive d, and then filtered with low protein binding filters (Millex-hV 0.45 mm polyvinylidene difluoride, Millipore Corp.)
before they were aliquot and stored at −80°C freezer.
Knockdown of erbB3 expression. Before infection, the ConshRNA or
ErbB3shRNA lentivirus–containing media (5 mL each tube) were thawed
completely at room temperature. Another 5-mL fresh DMEM/F12 medium
(10% FBS) and polybrene (8 μg/mL) were added into the virus-containing
media. Then, the cell culture media were replaced with the ConshRNA or
ErbB3shRNA lentivirus–containing media. After 24 h, the virus-infected
cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/mL) for 48 h and subjected to
required experiments.
Cell proliferation assay. The CellTiter96 AQ nonradioactive cell proliferation kit (Promega Corp.) was used to determine cell viability (32, 33).
Briefly, cells were plated onto 96-well plates for 24 h, and then grown in
either DMEM/F12 medium with 0.5% FBS as control, or the same medium
containing a series doses of SNDX-275 and incubated for another 72 h. After reading all wells at 490 nm with a microplate reader, the percentages of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (21). November 1, 2009

surviving cells from each group relative to controls, defined as 100% survival, were determined by reduction of MTS (inner salt).
Flow cytometry analysis. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow
cytometric analysis as described (34). In brief, cells grown in 100-mm culture dishes were harvested by trypsinization and fixed with 70% ethanol.
Cells were stained for total DNA content with a solution containing
50 μg/mL propidium iodide and 100 μg/mL RNase I in PBS for 30 min
at 37°C. Cell cycle distribution was then analyzed at the Core Facility of
University of Colorado Cancer Center with a FACScan flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences).
Quantification of apoptosis. An apoptosis ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics
Corp.) was used to quantitatively measure cytoplasmic histone-associated
DNA fragments (mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes) as previously
reported (33, 34).
Western blot analysis. Protein expression levels were determined by
Western blot analyses as described (32, 33). Briefly, cells were lysed in a
buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP40,
50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/mL leupeptin, and 25 μg/mL aprotinin. The lysates were centrifuged at full speed for 20 min and the supernatants were collected for
protein concentration determination by the Coomassie Plus protein assay
reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.). Equal amounts of cell lysates were subjected
to Western blot analysis with specific antibodies as described in the figure
legends.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses of the experimental data were
performed using a two-sided Student's t test. Significance was set at a
P value of <0.05.

Results
SNDX-275 selectively inhibits cell proliferation/survival of
erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells in vitro. To explore
whether SNDX-275 might be a potential therapeutic agent against
erbB2-overexpressing and basal breast cancers, we investigated its
antiproliferative/antisurvival activities in erbB2-overexpressing
(SKBR3, BT474, MDA-MB-453) and basal (MDA-MB-468, BT20,
MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines. SNDX-275 inhibited proliferation of all cells in a dose-dependent manner. The erbB2overexpressing cells were much more sensitive than basal cells
to SNDX-275-induced growth inhibition (Fig. 1A). The IC50 values
were 0.4 to 1.2 μmol/L for erbB2-overexpressing cells, and 2.5 to
4.5 μmol/L for basal cells. As a class I HDACi, SNDX-275 showed
equal efficiency in inducing histone H3 acetylation in both erbB2overexpressing and basal breast cancer cells (Fig. 1B and C);
however, SNDX-275 exhibited different effects on the downstream
signaling pathways. Although SNDX-275 significantly decreased the
levels of P-Akt in SKBR3, BT474, and MDA-MB-453 cells in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1B), it was less effective on modulation of
P-Akt in MDA-MB-468, BT20, and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C).
SNDX-275 also reduced the levels of P-MAPK in SKBR3 and
MDA-MB-453 cells, but had no significant effects on P-MAPK in
all basal breast cancer cells tested. Thus, SNDX-275 preferential inhibition of cell proliferation/survival of erbB2-overexpressing cells
correlated with inactivation of the downstream signaling Akt and/
or MAPK.
SNDX-275 blocks cell cycle progression and selectively induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in erbB2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells. To determine the molecular mechanisms by
which erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells were more sensitive to SNDX-275–mediated inhibitory effects, we first studied
whether SNDX-275 might induce apoptosis in these breast cancer
cells. Apoptosis-specific ELISA revealed that SNDX-275 dramatic‐
ally induced apoptosis in SKBR3, BT474, and MDA-MB-453 cells,

HDACi Down-regulates erbB3 Expression

Figure 1. SNDX-275 preferably inhibits proliferation/survival of erbB2-overexpressing compared with basal breast cancer cells. A, the indicated cells were plated onto
96-well plates with complete medium (DMEM/F12, 10% FBS). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with control medium (DMEM/F12, 0.5% FBS) or same medium
containing the indicated concentrations of SNDX-275 for another 72 h. The percentages of surviving cells from each cell line relative to controls, defined as 100%
survival, were determined by reduction of MTS. Points, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. B and C, cells treated with the indicated concentrations of
SNDX-275 for 24 h were collected and subjected to Western blot analyses of P-Akt, Akt, P-MAPK, MAPK, Acetyl-Histone H3, Histone H3, or β-actin.

but only marginally promoted apoptosis in MDA-MB-468, BT20,
and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2A). The induction fold of apoptosis
was 8.25 for SKBR3, 18.25 for BT474, and 9.98 for MDA-MB-453
cells. In contrast, the fold of apoptosis induction was significantly
less in all three basal lines (2.4 for MDA-MB-468, 3.5 for BT20, and
3.3 for MDA-MB-231 cells) compared with that of SKBR3 cells (P <
0.001). Furthermore, Western blot analyses indicated that treatment with SNDX-275 in erbB2-overexpressing, but not basal,
breast cancer cells induced PARP cleavage and activation of both
caspase-8 and caspase-3 evidenced by the increases of cleaved
caspase-8 and caspase-3 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that SNDX-275 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in erbB2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells. Next, we investigated whether SNDX-275 might have
different modulation on cell cycle progression. SNDX-275 predominantly induced G1 arrest and exhibited a less significant effect
on G2-M arrest in SKBR3, BT474, and MDA-MB-453 cells, whereas
in the basal cells SNDX-275 mainly arrested the cells at G2-M
phase (Fig. 3A). These data correlated well with the Western blot
analyses on several key molecular markers regulating cell cycle
progression. Consistent with a previous report showing that the
CDK inhibitor p21waf1 is one of the most commonly induced genes
by HDACi (19), we did discover a significant induction of p21waf1
by SNDX-275 (Fig. 3B and C), which may contribute to the cell
cycle G2-M arrest we observed in all cells. Cyclin D1 and E2F1

www.aacrjournals.org

are two important positive regulators at the G1-S checkpoint of
cell cycle. Treatment with SNDX-275 reduced the levels of both
cyclin D1 and E2F1 in a dose-dependent manner only in the
erbB2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3B). E2F1 reduction was also
found in one of the basal cell lines (MDA-MB-468), which might
explain why SNDX-275 induced minor G1 arrest in MDA-MB-468
cells (Fig. 3C and A). Collectively, our results show that SNDX275 selectively induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in erbB2overexpressing cells, and blocks cell cycle progression in both
erbB2-overexpressing and basal breast cancer cells.
SNDX-275 treatment results in down-regulation of both
erbB2 and erbB3, but not EGFR in breast cancer cells. Basal
breast cancer cells lack expression of ER, progestrone receptor,
and erbB2, but often overexpress EGFR and/or cytokeratin 5/6
(1). In contrast, erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells generally
have little EGFR expression, but frequently coexpress with erbB3
(35, 36). To study why these two subtypes showed distinct sensitivity to SNDX-275, we concentrated our following experiments on
erbB receptors, and wondered whether this HDACi might possess
particular effects on the expression and/or activation of the erbB
receptors. In erbB2-overexpressing cells, the levels of P-erbB2,
erbB2, P-erbB3, and erbB3 were all significantly reduced in a
dose-dependent manner upon SNDX-275 treatment (Fig. 4A). In
contrast, SNDX-275 had no significant effects on the levels of both

275 did not reduce the expression levels of HDAC1, HDAC2,
or HDAC3 in all three basal breast cancer cells. Thus, there is a
correlation between SNDX-275–induced HDAC1 and HDAC2
reduction and its inhibitory effects on erbB2/erbB3 and their
downstream signaling.
Elevated expression of erbB3 activates Akt signaling and
attenuates SNDX-275–induced apoptosis in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. To determine whether down-regulation
of erbB3 is required for SNDX-275–induced apoptosis in erbB2overexpressing cells, exogenous expression of erbB3 via transient
transfection was performed in SKBR3, BT474, and MDA-MB-453
cells. Transfection with pDsRed-erbB3, compared with transfection
with the control vector, significantly abrogated SNDX-275–mediated
antiproliferative/antisurvival effects (Fig. 5A). At the molecular level, elevated expression of erbB3 completely reverted SNDX-275–
mediated reduction in P-erbB3 and P-Akt, but had little effect
on the reduction of P-erbB2 and P-MAPK by SNDX-275 (Fig. 5B,
left). Moreover, forced expression of erbB3 also decreased the levels of cleaved PARP, caspase-8, caspase-3–induced by SNDX-275

caspases in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Cells cultured with

were collected and subjected to apoptosis ELISA (A). Columns, mean of three

P-EGFR and EGFR in those basal cells, although at the highest concentration (5 μmol/L) we tested, SNDX-275 marginally decreased
the levels of P-EGFR and EGFR in MDA-MB-468 cells and MDAMB-231 cells, respectively (Fig. 4B). It seemed SNDX-275 preferably
targeted erbB2/erbB3 receptors rather than EGFR. To further support this hypothesis, additional experiments were performed to
evaluate whether SNDX-275 might have any effects on EGFR expression in those erbB2-overexpressing cells. Although EGFR
expression was clearly observed in the control cells, it was undetectable with 1-minute exposure and showed fine signals with a
longer exposure time (15 minute) in SKBR3, BT474, and MDAMB-453 cells (Fig. 4C), confirming that the erbB2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells indeed have little EGFR expression. Nonetheless, the expression levels of EGFR remained unchanged upon
SNDX-275 treatment in all three lines (Fig. 4C). Thus, the discrimination effects on erbB receptors by SNDX-275 might account for
its distinct activities on the downstream signaling Akt and MAPK.
The class I HDAC contains HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and
HDAC8 (17, 37, 38). SNDX-275 preferentially inhibits HDAC1 compared with HDAC3, and has little or no effect on HDAC8 (39). We
next explored the potential effects of SNDX-275 on HDAC1,
HDAC2, and HDAC3 in these breast cancer cells. SNDX-275 treatment had no effect on HDAC3, but resulted in gradually reduction
of HDAC1 in SKBR3, BT474, and MDA-MB-453 cells. Although similar reduction of HDAC2 was observed in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-453
cells, the expression levels of HDAC2 in BT474 cells remained unchanged upon SNDX-275 treatment (Fig. 4D). In contrast, SNDX-

HDACi Down-regulates erbB3 Expression

(Fig. 5B, right), suggesting a weakened apoptosis. Specific apoptosis ELISA further confirmed that transfection with pDsRed-erbB3,
not the control vector, significantly reduced SNDX-275–induced
apoptosis (Fig. 5C). Collectively, elevated expression of erbB3 attenuates SNDX-275–induced apoptosis via activation of Akt in
erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.
Specific knockdown of erbB3 expression enhances SNDX275–induced apoptosis in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells. We next investigated whether knockdown of erbB3 expression may have synergistic antiproliferative/antisurvival effects with
SNDX-275. Specific knockdown of erbB3 was achieved with a lentiviral system containing human erbB3 shRNA. As shown in Fig. 6A,
erbB3 shRNA, but not control shRNA, dramatically decreased
erbB3 expression levels in SKBR3, BT474, and MDA-MB-453 cells.
In contrast, erbB2 levels remained unchanged in all cells, suggesting that the erbB3 shRNA was specific and efficient. Specific knockdown of erbB3 did not induce apoptosis. Consistent with previous
data, SNDX-275 treatment alone reduced erbB3 and erbB2 expression; induced PARP, caspase-8, and caspase-3 cleavage (but no caspase-9 cleavage); and promoted apoptosis in all three cell lines.

Importantly, combination of erbB3 knockdown and SNDX-275
treatment further increased the levels of cleaved PARP, caspase-8,
caspase-3, and induced caspase-9 cleavage (Fig. 6A), and significantly accelerated apoptosis compared with either erbB3 knockdown or SNDX-275 treatment alone (Fig. 6B). On the downstream
signaling pathways, either erbB3 knockdown or SNDX-275 treatment alone reduced the levels of P-Akt, and their combination
further reduced P-Akt levels. Although SNDX-275 treatment alone
decreased P-MAPK in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-453, but not BT474
cells, which was consistent with previous data (Fig. 1B), specific
knockdown of erbB3 alone decreased P-MAPK only in BT474
cells. The combination of erbB3 knockdown and SNDX-275 treatment had no further significant effects on P-MAPK (Fig. 6A). Although elevated expression of erbB3 via transfection attenuated
SNDX-275–induced histone H3 acetylation (Fig. 5B), erbB3 knockdown strikingly increased the levels of histone H3 and its acetylation upon SNDX-275 treatment. Thus, specific knockdown of
erbB3 expression enhances SNDX-275–induced apoptosis and inactivation of the downstream signaling Akt in erbB2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells.

Discussion
Coexpression of erbB family members is common in human
breast cancer. Novel strategies that simultaneously target multiple
erbB receptors have drawn great interest. Agents that inhibit both
EGFR and erbB2 tyrosine kinase activities have been developed
(40). One of these new agents, lapatinib (GlaxoSmithKline), has
been approved by Food and Drug Administration to treat metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress erbB2
(41). However, only a minority of erbB2-altered breast cancers have
coexistent overexpression of EGFR. Most metastatic breast cancers
show expression for either EGFR or erbB2, and less often for both
(42). In contrast, coexpression of erbB3 and erbB2 is frequently observed in breast cancers (35) and breast cancer cell lines (36). It has
been reported that erbB2 requires erbB3 to promote breast cancer
cell proliferation (43), and erbB3 plays an important role in erbB2altered breast cancers (44). Our recent studies indicate that expression of erbB3 contributes to erbB2-mediated tamoxifen resistance
(33). Thus, novel strategies or agents simultaneously targeting both

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (21). November 1, 2009

erbB3 and erbB2 may have a broader impact on treatment of
breast cancer.
In an attempt to identify novel therapeutic agents for erbB2overexpressing and basal breast cancers, we have discovered that
the class I HDACi SNDX-275 exhibits a greater efficacy against
erbB2-overexpressing cells. At its clinically achievable range
(≤1 μmol/L; ref. 45), SNDX-275 strongly inhibits proliferation of
erbB2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1A), which is accompanied by significant reduction of cyclin D1 and E2F1 (Fig. 3B). Mechanistically,
SNDX-275 inactivates the Akt and/or MAPK signaling via downregulation of both erbB3 and erbB2 (Figs. 1B and 4A). In contrast,
SNDX-275 has little effect on EGFR. More importantly, elevated expression of erbB3 abrogates and specific knockdown of erbB3 enhances SNDX-275–mediated inactivation of Akt and Akt-induced
apoptosis in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. These significant findings not only confirm that erbB3 is required for
erbB2-mediated breast cancer cell proliferation and survival, but
also suggest that targeting erbB3 may be an excellent therapeutic

strategy against breast cancers with coexpression of erbB3 and
erbB2.
Interestingly, we have repeatedly observed that SNDX-275 specifically reduced the protein levels of endogenous erbB3, but not
the exogenous erbB3 via transient transfection, and therefore, it
had no effect on the P-Akt levels increased by elevated expression
of erbB3 (Fig. 5B). The similar discrimination effects of SNDX-275
on endogenous and exogenous erbB2 were also found (data not
shown). These results suggest that the mechanisms of SNDX275–mediated reduction of erbB2 and erbB3 may be independent
of protein degradation, and it might modulate expression of certain microRNAs that specifically target both erbB2 and erbB3.
We are currently testing this novel hypothesis.
It has been reported that LAQ824 and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) are able to down-regulate erbB2 in SKBR3 and

BT474 cells via acetylation of heat shock protein (hsp) 90 (46,
47). This hsp90 acetylation reduces the chaperone association with
its client erbB2, shifts the binding of erbB2 from hsp90 to hsp70,
and subsequently promotes ubiquitylation-dependent degradation
of erbB2 (46, 47). As two broad spectrum HDACis, both LAQ824
and SAHA inhibit the activity of HDAC6, which is the major HDAC
that modulates hsp90 activity (48, 49). However, as a specific class I
HDACi, SNDX-275 has no effect on HDAC6 (17). Thus, SNDX-275–
mediated reduction of erbB2 protein is through an HDAC6-independent mechanism. Although LAQ824 slightly reduces the levels
of erbB3 (47), it remains unknown about the activity of SAHA toward erbB3 in breast cancer cells. To the best of our knowledge,
SNDX-275 is the first agent with a strong activity of dual-targeting
both erbB3 and erbB2 in breast cancer cells. Consistent with previous reports (46, 47), we have found that SNDX-275 induces cell

enhances SNDX-275–induced inhibition of downstream
signaling and apoptosis in erbB2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells. SKBR3, BT474, and MDA-MB-453 were
infected with lentivirus containing either ConshRNA or
ErbB3shRNA. After 24 h, virus-infected cells were
selected with puromycin (1 μg/mL) for 48 h, and then
cultured with DMEM/F12 (0.5% FBS) in the presence
or absence of SNDX-275 for 24 h. Cells were collected and
subjected to Western blot analyses of erbB3, erbB2, PARP,
caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, P-Akt, Akt,
P-MAPK, MAPK, Acetyl-Histone H3, Histone H3, or β-actin
(A) or apoptosis ELISA (B).

cycle G 2 -M arrest in SKBR3, BT474, and MDA-MB-453 cells
(Fig. 3A). Nonetheless, SNDX-275 predominantly arrests the cells
at G1 phase, which is associated with a significant reduction in cyclin D1 and E2F1 (Fig. 3B). LAQ824 and SAHA do not arrest cells at
G1 phase (46, 47), suggesting that these two HDACis might not affect the expression of cyclin D1 and E2F1 in SKBR3 and BT474
cells. Because of their ability to down-regulate erbB2, both
LAQ824 and SAHA show synergistic cytotoxic effects against breast
cancer with erbB2 amplification and/or overexpression when combined with trastuzumab or other drugs (46, 47). Because SNDX-275
dual-targets erbB3 and erbB2, and results in significant inactivation of Akt and/or MAPK, it should have a better synergism with
trastuzumab and other chemotherapeutic agents. Indeed our recent studies indicate that SNDX-275 and trastuzumab exhibit
synergistic antiproliferative/antisurvival activities in SKBR3 and
BT474 cells.4 It will be interesting to explore whether SNDX275 also has synergistic anticancer activities with another
erbB2-targeted therapy, lapatinib, and if SNDX-275 can overcome
trastuzumab resistance, and enhance trastuzumab-mediated
growth inhibition in those trastuzumab-resistant cells.
Up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-α–related apoptosisinducing ligand has been reported as one of the molecular mechanisms by which HDACi, including SNDX-275, induces apoptosis in
breast cancer cells (28, 29). Those studies were mainly performed
in ER-positive and basal breast cancer cells with higher concentrations of SNDX-275. It is not known whether SNDX-275 can also in-

duce tumor necrosis factor-α–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
expression in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. To date,
the molecular mechanisms of SNDX-275–induced down-regulation
of erbB3 remain unclear. Studies on such molecular mechanisms
may provide new avenues to identify novel strategies targeting
erbB3 and the downstream signaling, which may enhance erbB2targeted therapies in breast cancer patients whose tumors have coexpression of both erbB3 and erbB2.
In summary, our results show that the class I HDACi SNDX-275
preferably inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis of
erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells via down-regulation of
erbB3 expression and inactivation of the Akt and/or MAPK signaling. SNDX-275 treatment causes cell cycle arrest predominantly at
G1 phase in erbB2-overexpressing cells associated with reductions
of both cyclin D1 and E2F1 and an up-regulation of p21waf1. These
data suggest that SNDX-275 may be developed as a novel therapeutic agent to treat breast cancers with coexpression of both erbB3
and erbB2.
