Abstract
Constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants
(AR-V) lacking the ligand-binding domain have been implicated in the pathogenesis of castration-resistant prostate cancer
and in mediating resistance to newer drugs that target the
androgen axis. AR-V regulates expression of both canonical AR
targets and a unique set of cancer-speciﬁc targets that are
enriched for cell-cycle functions. However, little is known
about how AR-V controls gene expression. Here, we report that
two major AR-Vs, termed AR-V7 and ARv567es, not only homodimerize and heterodimerize with each other but also heterodimerize with full-length androgen receptor (AR-FL) in an

androgen-independent manner. We found that heterodimerization of AR-V and AR-FL was mediated by N- and C-terminal
interactions and by the DNA-binding domain of each molecule, whereas AR-V homodimerization was mediated only by
DNA-binding domain interactions. Notably, AR-V dimerization
was required to transactivate target genes and to confer castrationresistant cell growth. Our results clarify the mechanism by which
AR-Vs mediate gene regulation and provide a pivotal pathway for
rational drug design to disrupt AR-V signaling as a rational strategy
for the effective treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Cancer Res;

Introduction

some patients present with therapy-resistant disease, and most
initial responders develop acquired resistance within months of
therapy initiation (3, 4). The resistance is typically accompanied by increased prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA), indicating
reactivated AR signaling (3, 4). Accumulating evidences indicate that prostate tumors can adapt to these androgen-directed
therapies, including abiraterone and enzalutamide, by signaling through constitutively active alternative splicing variants of
AR (AR-V; refs. 5–17).
To date, 15 AR-Vs have been identiﬁed (18). Structurally,
AR-Vs have insertions of cryptic exons downstream of the
exons encoding the DNA-binding domain (DBD) or deletions
of the exons encoding the ligand-binding domain (LBD),
resulting in a disrupted AR open reading frame and expression
of LBD-truncated AR (6, 7, 9, 15, 19, 20). Because the Nterminal domain, which contains the most critical transactivation domain of the receptor (AF1), and the DBD remain intact
in the majority of the AR-Vs, many AR-Vs display ligandindependent transactivation. AR-V7 (aka AR3) and ARv567es
(aka AR-V12) are two major AR-Vs expressed in clinical specimens (7–10, 15, 17). They localize primarily to the nucleus,
activate target gene expression in a ligand-independent manner, and promote castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer
cells both in vitro and in vivo (7, 9, 15, 19–21). Strikingly,
patients with high levels of expression of AR-V7 or detectable
expression of ARv567es in prostate tumors have a shorter survival than other CRPC patients (8). Moreover, AR-V7 expression in circulating tumor cells of CRPC patients is associated
with resistance to both abiraterone and enzalutamide (17).
These ﬁndings indicate an association between AR-V expression and a more lethal form of prostate cancer, and also
highlight the importance of AR-Vs in limiting the efﬁcacy of
androgen-directed therapies.

Recurrence with lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) after androgen deprivation therapy remains the major
challenge in treatment of advanced prostate cancer (1, 2).
Signiﬁcant advances in our understanding of continued androgen receptor (AR) signaling in CRPC have led to the development and FDA approval of two next-generation androgendirected therapies, the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone and the potent AR antagonist enzalutamide (3, 4). These
drugs heralded a new era of prostate cancer therapy. However,

AR-V7 and ARv567es can regulate the expression of both canonical AR targets and a unique set of targets enriched for cell-cycle
function independent of the full-length AR (AR-FL; refs. 7, 10, 15).
AR-V7 and ARv567es can also activate AR-FL in the absence of
androgen by facilitating AR-FL nuclear localization and coregulate
the expression of canonical AR targets (5). It has long been
appreciated that dimerization is required for AR-FL to regulate
target gene expression (22), but little is known about AR-V
dimerization. Coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous ARv567es
and AR-FL (15) and co-occupancy of the PSA promoter by AR-V7
and AR-FL (5) suggest that AR-Vs may form heterodimers with
AR-FL. However, whether AR-Vs homodimerize or heterodimerize with each other and whether the dimerization is required for
AR-Vs to regulate target genes and to confer castration-resistant
cell growth are currently unknown.
Dimerization of AR-FL is mediated mainly through N/C-terminal interactions, via the FxxLF motif in the N-terminal domain
and the coactivator groove in the LBD, and DBD/DBD interactions, via the dimerization box (D-box; ref. 22). Because the FxxLF
motif and the D-box (Fig. 1A) are maintained in the majority of
the AR-Vs identiﬁed, we hypothesize that these AR-Vs can form
heterodimers with each other as well as homodimers via DBD/
DBD interactions and that they can also form heterodimers with
AR-FL via DBD/DBD and N/C interactions. In the current study,
we tested this hypothesis by using the bimolecular ﬂuorescence
complementation (BiFC) and bioluminescence resonance energy
transfer (BRET) assays, which have complementary capabilities
for characterizing protein–protein interactions in live cells. BiFC
allows direct visualization of subcellular locations of the interactions (23), while BRET allows real-time detection of complex
formation (24, 25).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
LNCaP, PC-3, DU145, VCaP, and HEK-293T cells were
obtained from the ATCC, and cultured as described (26). C4-2
was provided by Dr. Shahriar Koochekpour (Roswell Park Cancer
Institute, Buffalo, NY). All the cell lines were authenticated on
April 1, 2015 by the method of short tandem repeat proﬁling at
the Genetica DNA Laboratories. Enzalutamide was purchased
from Selleck Chemicals.
Plasmid construction
To generate different BiFC fusion constructs of AR-FL, AR-V7,
and ARv567es, we PCR ampliﬁed the AR-FL, AR-V7, and ARv567es
cDNAs from their respective expression construct, and cloned the
PCR amplicons separately into a TA-cloning vector (Promega).
Fusion constructs of AR-FL, ARv567es, and AR-V7 with either VN or
VC were generated by subcloning the cDNAs from the TA plasmids into the SalI and XhoI sites of the pBiFC-VN155 and pBiFCVC155 vectors. The mutant BiFC-AR-V and BiFC-AR-FL constructs
with mutations at the FxxLF motif (F23,27A/L26A) and/or D-box
(A596T/S597T) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis by
using the Q5 site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England BioLabs). BRET-fusion constructs of AR-FL, AR-V7, and ARv567es were
generated by subcloning the AR-FL, AR-V7, and ARv567es cDNA
from the respective TA plasmids into the BamHI and XbaI sites of
the pcDNA3.1-RLuc8.6 and TurboFP635 vectors (24). The doxycycline-inducible ARv567es lentiviral construct was generated by
subcloning the ARv567es cDNA from its TA plasmid ﬁrst into the
pDONR221 vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently into the doxycycline-inducible pHAGE-Ind-EF1a-DEST-GH lentiviral construct

Reporter gene assay was performed as previously described
(28) with either an androgen-responsive element-luciferase plasmid (ARE-luc) containing three ARE regions ligated in tandem to
the luciferase reporter or a luciferase construct driven by three
repeats of an AR-V–speciﬁc promoter element of the ubiquitinconjugating enzyme E2C (UBE2C) gene (UBE2C-luc). To ensure

was added at 24 hours after transfection. At 48 hours after
transfection, cells were ﬁxed with 70% ethanol, and incubated
with a pan-AR antibody (PG-21, Millipore; 1:200) overnight at
4 C and subsequently with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen; 1:1,000) for 1 hour at room

Cells were cotransfected with different BiFC fusion constructs.
At 48 hours after transfection, cells were incubated with
Hoechst33342 (Invitrogen) and observed by ﬂuorescence microscopy (Olympus). For ﬂow cytometry quantitation of BiFC signals,
the pDsRed2-C1 construct (Clontech) was cotransfected with the
BiFC fusion constructs. At 48 hours after transfection, cells were
trypsinized, and the Venus and DsRed ﬂuorescence were analyzed
by ﬂow cytometry.

Quantitative RT-PCR and cell growth assay
Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed as described
(30), and the qPCR primer probe sets were from IDT. Cell
growth was determined by the sulforhodamine (SRB) assay as
described (31). To ensure an even transduction efﬁciency,
we conducted the transduction of the cells with packaged
lentivirus in bulk, and then split the transduced cells for
qRT-PCR and SRB assays.
BRET assay
Cells were either transfected with an RLuc BRET fusion plasmid
or cotransfected with an RLuc and a TFP BRET fusion plasmid. At
72 hours after transfection, cells were detached with 5 mmol/L
EDTA in PBS and resuspended in PBS with 1% sucrose. Cells were
counted and seeded in triplicate into a 96-well white-wall microplate at 105 cells per well. Freshly prepared coelenterazine (Nanolight Technology) in water was added to the cells at a ﬁnal
concentration of 25 mmol/L. BRET readings at 528 nm and 635 nm
were obtained immediately with a Synergy 2 microplate reader
(BioTek). The BRET ratio was calculated by subtracting the ratio of
635-nm emission and 528-nm emission obtained from cells
coexpressing the RLuc and TFP fusion proteins from the background BRET ratio resulting from cells expressing the RLuc fusion
protein alone in the same experiment: BRET ratio ¼ (emission at
635 nm)/(emission at 528 nm)  (emission at 635 nm RLuc
only)/(emission at 528 nm RLuc only).

Results
Characterization of AR-FL and AR-Vs in BiFC fusion proteins
For BiFC analysis of interaction between proteins A and B, the
two proteins are fused separately to either the N- or C-terminal
fragment of the Venus ﬂuorescent protein (VN or VC, Fig. 1B). If
the two proteins dimerize, the interaction allows regeneration of
the Venus ﬂuorescent protein to emit ﬂuorescent signal (23).
Because BiFC depends on the relative orientation of the fusion
proteins (23), we generated all possible combinations of N- and
C-terminal fusions by cloning the AR-FL, ARv567es, or AR-V7 cDNA
either in front of or after VN or VC. Different pairs of fusion
protein constructs were transfected into the AR-null PC-3 cells (to
avoid confounding effect of endogenous AR), and the fusion
protein constructs exhibiting the highest BiFC signals (Fig. 1C)
were chosen for further analysis. The transactivating abilities of
the fusion proteins were tested by the reporter gene assay.
Although the protein fusion affected the relative activities of the
fusion proteins (Figs. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1), all the
fusion proteins can transactivate target genes. Immunoﬂuorescence assay further showed that the AR-FL and AR-Vs in the fusion
proteins have the same subcellular localizations as the respective
nonfusion AR isoform (Fig. 1E). Collectively, the data indicated
that AR-FL and AR-Vs are functional in the fusion proteins.
BiFC detection of AR-V/AR-FL heterodimerization
To assess the ability of AR-V7 and ARv567es to heterodimerize
with AR-FL, we cotransfected the AR-V- and AR-FL BiFC fusion
constructs into PC-3 cells and quantitated the Venus ﬂuorescence
signal by ﬂow cytometry. Both AR-V7 and ARv567es dimerized with
AR-FL, and the dimerization did not require androgen (Fig. 2A
and B). To delineate the dimerization interface, we generated
mutant BiFC-AR-V constructs with mutations at the FxxLF motif
(F23,27A/L26A) and/or D-box (A596T/S597T). FxxLF motif
and D-box mediate AR-FL homodimerization through N/C and
DBD/DBD interactions, respectively (22). Only mutating both
motifs abolished AR-V/AR-FL dimerization (Fig. 2A and B),
indicating that both N/C and DBD/DBD interactions mediate

the dimerization. Mutating one motif did not lead to signiﬁcant
change of BiFC signal (Fig. 2A and B), likely due to compensation
of the loss of one mode of interaction by the other. Similar results
were obtained in DU145 and HEK-293T cells (Supplementary
Figs. S2 and S3). Intriguingly, although ARv567es/AR-FL dimerization was observed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, AR-V7/
AR-FL dimerization was detected primarily in the nucleus in the
vast majority of the cells (Figs. 2A and B, Supplementary Figs. S2A,
S2B, S3A, and S3B).
Pretreatment of cells with DHT attenuated AR-V7/AR-FL dimerization, and this effect was blocked by the antiandrogen enzalutamide (Fig. 2C). Conversely, DHT pretreatment produced minimal effect on the dimerization of AR-V7 and the FxxLF-motif–
mutated AR-FL (Fig. 2D), which lost the ability to homodimerize
upon androgen treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4B; ref. 32).
These data indicate that AR-V7 may compete with AR-FL for
dimerizing with AR-FL. Notably, the expression of each of the
wild-type and mutant fusion proteins was conﬁrmed by Western
blotting (Fig. 2E). Collectively, our data demonstrated androgenindependent dimerization between AR-V and AR-FL, and indicated that AR-V/AR-FL dimerization may attenuate androgen
induction of AR-FL homodimerization.

when expressed alone (Figs. 3B and C and Supplementary
Figs. S2C, S2D, S3C, and S3D). The homodimerization can
also occur when AR-V is coexpressed with AR-FL and even
when it is expressed at a much lower level than AR-FL
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Moreover, AR-V7 and ARv567es can
heterodimerize (Fig. 3D). Mutating D-box, but not the FxxLF
motif, abolished AR-V/AR-V interactions, indicating that ARVs homodimerize and heterodimerize with each other
through DBD/DBD interactions. Interestingly, similar to
AR-V7/AR-FL dimerization, AR-V7/AR-V7 dimerization was
detected primarily in the nucleus (Figs. 3B and Supplementary
Figs. S2C and S3C). However, ARv567es/ARv567es and AR-V7/
ARv567es dimerization were observed in both the nucleus and
the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C and D and Supplementary Figs. S2D
and S3D).
Characterization of AR-FL and AR-Vs in BRET fusion proteins
We then used the newest BRET system, BRET6 (24), to conﬁrm
the BiFC results. BRET6 is based on energy transfer between the
Rluc8.6 Renilla luciferase (Rluc) energy donor and the turbo red
ﬂuorescent protein (TFP) energy acceptor when the donor and
acceptor are brought into close proximity by their fused proteins
(Fig. 4A). Similar to BiFC, BRET also depends on the relative
orientation of the fusion proteins. We therefore generated all
possible combinations of N- and C-terminal fusions by cloning
the AR-FL, ARv567es, or AR-V7 cDNA either in front of or after Rluc

or TFP. Different pairs of the fusion protein constructs were
transfected into the AR-null HEK-293T cells (to avoid confounding effect of endogenous AR), and the fusion protein constructs
exhibiting the highest BRET signals (Fig. 4B) were chosen for
further analysis. The expression of these fusion proteins was
conﬁrmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, their
abilities to transactivate were validated by luciferase assay with
the cotransfection of the ARE-luc plasmid (Fig. 4D), indicating
that AR-FL and AR-Vs are functional in the BRET fusion proteins.
BRET conﬁrmation of AR-V/AR-FL and AR-V/AR-V dimerization
Figure 5 shows the BRET saturation curves for different combinations of the BRET fusion proteins in HEK-293T cells. The BRET
ratios increased hyperbolically and rapidly saturated with the
increase in the ratio of energy acceptor to energy donor, indicating
speciﬁc protein–protein interaction (33). Similar to the BiFC data,
mutating the FxxLF-motif and/or the D-box inhibited AR-V/AR-FL
and AR-V/AR-V dimerization (Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, the
BRET data conﬁrmed the BiFC results, showing the ability of
AR-Vs to heterodimerize with AR-FL and to homodimerize.
ARv567es/ARv567es interaction was further demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation assay (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Dimerization is required for AR-V action
To assess the requirement of dimerization for AR-V action, we
ﬁrst performed reporter gene assay with the wild-type or the
dimerization mutants of AR-V. As shown in Fig. 6A, the dimerization mutants completely lost the ability to transactivate, indi-

cating a requirement of dimerization for AR-V transactivation. We
then analyzed the ability of the wild-type and dimerization
mutants of AR-Vs to regulate target gene expression and castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer cells. To this end, we
infected the AR-FL–expressing LNCaP cells with lentivirus encoding AR-V7 or doxycycline-inducible ARv567es. Mutation of the
FxxLF motif alone or both the FxxLF motif and D-box attenuated
AR-V induction of androgen-independent expression of the
canonical AR target PSA and the AR-V–speciﬁc target UBE2C (Fig.
6B) as well as castration-resistant cell growth (Fig. 6C). The data
indicated the requirement of dimerization for AR-Vs to regulate
target genes and to confer castration-resistant cell growth.

Discussion
The current study represents the ﬁrst to show the dimeric nature
of AR-Vs in live cells. Using BiFC and BRET assays, we showed that
AR-V7 and ARv567es not only homodimerize and heterodimerize
with each other but also heterodimerize with AR-FL. The dimerization does not require androgen. By mutating the FxxLF motif in
the N-terminal domain and/or D-box in DBD of AR-Vs, we further
showed that AR-V/AR-FL dimerization is mediated by both N/C
and DBD/DBD interactions, whereas AR-V/AR-V dimerization is
through DBD/DBD interactions. Because AR-Vs lack the C-terminal domain, the N/C interactions between AR-V and AR-FL is
mediated presumably via the FxxLF motif of AR-V and the
C-terminal domain of AR-FL. Signiﬁcantly, dimerization mutants
of AR-Vs lose the ability to transactivate target genes and to confer

castration-resistant cell growth, indicating the requirement of
dimerization for important functions of AR-Vs.
Our ﬁnding on AR-V/AR-FL interaction is in accordance with
the previous reports on ARv567es and AR-FL coimmunoprecipitation (15) as well as on AR-V7 and AR-FL co-occupancy of the PSA
promoter (5), providing a direct evidence for their dimerization.
Interestingly, we found that the androgen-independent dimerization between AR-V and AR-FL may mitigate androgen induction of AR-FL homodimerization. This could constitute a mechanistic basis for the ability of AR-Vs to attenuate androgen
induction of AR-FL activity (5). To date, functional studies of
AR-Vs have been focused mostly on their ability to regulate gene
expression independent of AR-FL. Because AR-Vs are often coexpressed with AR-FL in biologic contexts, it is conceivable that the
ability of AR-Vs to heterodimerize with and activate AR-FL in an
androgen-independent manner could be equally important as
their AR-FL–independent activity to castration resistance.
We and others showed previously that AR-V7 and ARv567es
localize constitutively to the nucleus and can facilitate AR-FL
nuclear entry (5, 15), indicating that the initial interaction
between AR-V and AR-FL is likely to be in the cytoplasm. This
is supported by our data showing both cytoplasmic and nuclear
localization of ARv567es/AR-FL dimerization. Intriguingly, AR-V7/
AR-FL dimerization is detected primarily in the nucleus in the vast
majority of the cells. This may be due to the regeneration of the
Venus ﬂuorescent protein from the VN and VC fragments being
slower than AR-V7/AR-FL nuclear translocation. Interestingly,
AR-V7/AR-V7 dimerization was also detected primarily in the
nucleus, whereas ARv567es/ARv567es and AR-V7/ARv567es dimeriza-

tion were observed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
Whether this is also due to slower regeneration of the Venus
ﬂuorescent protein than AR-V7/AR-V7 nuclear translocation or
AR-V7 entering the nucleus as a monomer requires further investigation. In addition, the majority of the posttranslational modiﬁcation sites of AR-FL are retained in AR-Vs (34). These posttranslational modiﬁcations regulate AR-FL transactivating activity, possibly via the interaction of AR-FL with other proteins or
with itself (34). It is very likely that these posttranslational
modiﬁcations may impact AR-V dimerization and transactivation
and therefore deserve further investigation.
We reported previously that AR-V binds to the promoter of its
speciﬁc target UBE2C without AR-FL, but co-occupies the promoter of the canonical AR target PSA with AR-FL in a mutually
dependent manner (5). Furthermore, knockdown of AR-FL and
AR-V both result in reduced androgen-independent PSA expression, but only AR-V knockdown downregulates UBE2C expression (5). The data, together with the ﬁndings from the current
study, indicate that AR-Vs regulate their speciﬁc targets as an AR-V/
AR-V dimer but control the expression of canonical AR targets as
an AR-V/AR-FL dimer. Interestingly, while mutating D-box alone
does not signiﬁcantly mitigate AR-V/AR-FL dimerization, the
mutation abolishes the ability of AR-V to induce the expression
of PSA and UBE2C as well as to promote castration-resistant cell
growth. A plausible explanation is that, although D-box–mutated
AR-V can dimerize with AR-FL, the dimer cannot bind to DNA
to regulate the expression of target genes. This, together with
the ﬁnding that D-box–D-box interactions are required for
the formation of androgen-induced AR-FL intermolecular N/C

interactions (32), indicates that disrupting D-box–D-box interactions could lead to inhibition of not only AR-V/AR-V dimerization and transactivation but also AR-FL activation induced by
either AR-Vs or androgens. Thus, disrupting D-box–D-box interactions may represent a more effective means to suppress AR
signaling than targeting the LBD of AR.
In summary, we demonstrated the dimeric nature of AR-Vs in
live cells and identiﬁed the dimerization interface. Signiﬁcantly,
we showed that proper dimerization is required for AR-V functions. The research therefore represents a key step in delineating
the mechanism by which AR-Vs mediate gene regulation. This is
vital for developing effective therapeutic strategies to disrupt AR-V
signaling and provide more effective treatments for prostate
cancer.
