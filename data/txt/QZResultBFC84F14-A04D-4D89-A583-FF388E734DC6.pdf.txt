ABSTRACT
Castration resistance is a major obstacle to hormonal therapy for prostate cancer
patients. Although androgen independence of prostate cancer growth is a known
contributing factor to endocrine resistance, the mechanism of androgen receptor
deregulation in endocrine resistance is still poorly understood. Herein, the CAMK2N1
was shown to contribute to the human prostate cancer cell growth and survival
through AR-dependent signaling. Reduced expression of CAMK2N1 was correlated to
recurrence-free survival of prostate cancer patients with high levels of AR expression
in their tumor. CAMK2N1 and AR signaling form an auto-regulatory negative feedback
loop: CAMK2N1 expression was down-regulated by AR activation; while CAMK2N1
inhibited AR expression and transactivation through CAMKII and AKT pathways.
Knockdown of CAMK2N1 in prostate cancer cells alleviated Casodex inhibition of
cell growth, while re-expression of CAMK2N1 in castration-resistant cells sensitized
the cells to Casodex treatment. Taken together, our findings suggest that CAMK2N1
plays a tumor suppressive role and serves as a crucial determinant of the resistance
of prostate cancer to endocrine therapies.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Prostate cancer is one of the most common
malignancies in men. As the average life expectancy
has been prolonged, the incidence and mortality rates
of prostate cancer have increased significantly in recent
years [1]. The progression of prostate cancer normally
goes from castration-sensitive to castration-resistant,
inevitably developing highly metastatic properties [2].
Prostate tumors initially respond to hormonal intervention
therapies, however, as androgen-independence emerges,
tumors develop resistance [3]. The main treatments for
advanced prostate cancer consist of hormone therapy,
chemotherapy and/or radiation. Unfortunately, although
the diagnosis of cancer has advanced, limited therapy
options stall are stalling the survival rates in patients [4,
5].
The CAMK2N1 gene, cloned and characterized as
an inhibitor of CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase II), has been shown to affect tumorigenesis
and tumor growth [6, 7]. In a prior study, we demonstrated
that CAMK2N1 expression was reduced in prostate
cancer, and re-introduction of CAMK2N1 significantly
impaired human prostate cancer cell proliferation and
tumor growth in vivo [8]. Genome-wide gene profiling
revealed that CAMK2N1 regulated the expression of key
genes associated with cell-cycle progression and apoptosis
[8]. Furthermore, CAMK2N1 suppressed androgen
receptor (AR) mRNA levels and AR regulators such as
IGF-1, ErbB2, AKT, and HSP27 [8]. This data suggests
that CAMK2N1 plays an important role in the progression
of prostate cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms
and functional link between CAMK2N1 and AR signaling
is still unknown.
In this study, we observed CAMK2N1 and AR
signaling form an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop
in human prostate cancer cells. CAMK2N1 expression
was inversely correlated with AR levels in prostate
cancer, and patients with higher CAMK2N1 expression
in their tumor have improved recurrence-free survival.
Importantly, ectopic expression of CAMK2N1 in
castration-resistant prostate cancer cells sensitized cells to
response to anti-androgen treatment. Taken together, our
findings revealed a tumor suppressive role for CAMK2N1
and established CAMK2N1 as molecular determinant in
hormone sensitivity of prostate cancer.

A significant negative correlation between
CAM2KN1 and AR in clinical prostate cancer
specimens
The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated
transcription factor, which plays critical roles in normal
prostate development and prostate tumorigenesis [3].
The growth of advanced prostate cancer (both castrationsensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) and castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC)) depends on androgen receptor
signaling. In our prior study, CAMK2N1 suppressed
the expression of AR (mRNA levels) and AR regulators
including IGF-1, ErbB2, JAK and HSP27 [8]. However,
the clinical significance of these observations has not
been investigated. We first performed in silico analysis
for AR and CAMK2N1 expression on a clinical geneexpression array dataset composed of 154 patient samples
with follow-up information (Supplemental Figure 1A) [9].
The Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to evaluate the
difference in recurrence-free survival associated with high
versus low expression of AR and CAMK2N1 gene. Genes
that correspond to the AR and CAMK2N1 signature were
used to assign the samples as high (upper 25th percentile)
or low (lower 75th percentile) [10]. In Kaplan-Meier
analysis for AR, patients with tumors expressing high AR
(n = 39) had significantly lower recurrence-free survival
(p = 0.0006) (Figure. 1A). In recurrent patients with high
AR expression (p = 0.023), there was a significant trend
toward improved survival of those patients with high
expression of CAMK2N1 (n = 19) compared to those with
low CAMK2N1 expression (n = 20) in tumors (Figure.
1B). As revealed by IHC to determine the expression of
AR and CAMK2N1 in the prostate cancer specimens
(n=70) [8]. AR and CAMK2N1 were inversely correlated
in human prostate cancer (r = -0.384, p = 0.0027) (Figure.
1C-D). Taken together, these results suggested a functional
interaction between CAMK2N1 and AR during prostate
cancer progression.

CAMK2N1 expression was down-regulated by
androgen/AR signaling
The inverse correlation between AR and CAMK2N1
raised a possibility that CAMK2N1 may functionally
interact with androgen/AR signaling. To explore this
possibility, we first determined whether androgen
signaling affects CAMK2N1 expression. Castrationsensitive prostate cancer cells LNCaP and castrationresistant prostate cancer cells C4-2 were treated with
1-10 nM of R1881 for 6-10 hrs and the total RNA was
isolated. As shown in Fig. 2A-B, Supplemental Figure
2A, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that CAMK2N1 mRNA

levels were decreased upon androgen treatment in LNCaP
cells. In addition, we searched the microarray data in the
public domains for effects of androgens on CAMK2N1
mRNA expression in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines
[11, 12], and similar observation was also made in this
database (Supplemental Figure 2B). Next, our western
blot and qRT-PCR analysis showed that CAMK2N1
protein and mRNA levels were decreased in cells treated
with androgen, and androgen inhibition of CAMK2N1
was alleviated by shRNA-mediated AR knockdown (Fig.
2C-E). Collectively, these observations indicate that
CAMK2N1 is an androgen-responsive gene, which is
down regulated by AR activation.
We further performed luciferase reporter assays
to evaluate the effect of androgen/AR signaling on

CAMK2N1 transactivation. The CAMK2N1 promoter
reporters (-39~-1011, -1112~-2006) were assessed in
AR-positive LNCaP cells and AR-negative PC3 cells.
R1881 repressed activity of CAMK2N1 gene reporters
(-39~-1011, but not -1112~-2006) in the presence of AR
(Fig. 2F-H). Taken together, these findings indicated that
CAMK2N1 expression and transactivation were downregulated by androgen/AR signaling.

PCR analysis in LNCaP cells with stable knockdown
of CAMK2N1. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells treated with
AR agonist R1881 increased AR protein expression and
decreased p21 expression. Depletion of CAMK2N1
further enhanced AR expression levels in the presence and
absence of the ligand. As shown in Fig. 3B-F, cells treated
with AR agonist R1881 increased AR, AR target genes
such as PSA and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels, and decreased

p21 mRNA levels, and depletion of CAMK2N1 further
enhanced AR, PSA and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels in the
presence and absence of the ligand.

assays to evaluate the effect of CAMK2N1 on AR

reporters including PSA-Luc and MMTV-Luc (Fig. 3GJ). Knockdown of CAMK2N1 increased R1881-induced
PSA-Luc activity by 2-fold (Fig. 3G) and MMTV-Luc
by 24-fold (Fig. 3H). Conversely, Overexpression of
CAMK2N1 reduced R1881-induced reporter activity by
50% (Fig. 3I-J). To examine the interaction between AR
and CAMK2N1 in the context of local chromatin, we
conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.
AR has been previously shown to bind to the enhancer

elements of the PSA gene (-4153/-3570 bp) [13, 14]. Thus
we performed ChIP analysis using anti-AR antibody to
pull down PSA enhancer elements. As shown in Fig. 3K,
shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous CAMK2N1
increased AR binding to the PSA enhancer elements in
an androgen-dependent manner. Taken together, these
observations suggested that CAMK2N1 inhibits AR
expression and AR-dependent transactivation.

a subset of genes that were AR, AKT, pAKTser473, Bcl-2,

of CAMK2N1 by shRNA in LNCaP cells resulted in
increased AR, pAKTser473, and Bcl-2 expression and
decreased p21 and Bax expression (Fig. 4A). Conversely,
overexpression of CAMK2N1 in LNCaP cells led to an
opposite effect on protein expression of these genes (Fig.

CAMKII is a ubiquitous serine/threonine protein
kinase that phosphorylates nearly 40 different proteins,
including enzymes, ion channels, kinases and transcription
factors [6, 7]. Previous study demonstrated that CAMKII
regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway by phosphorylating
AKT at Ser473 [15]. Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation
and activity suppresses AR levels in prostate cancer [16].
The current study demonstrated that CAMK2N1, the
inhibitor of CAMKII, inhibited AKT phosphorylation
at Ser473 and repressed AR expression and activity. In
order to further explore the functional interaction between
CAMK2N1 and AR, we conducted luciferase reporter and
Western blot to determine whether CAMK2N1-mediated
suppression of AR activity is dependent on CAMKII and
AKT signaling. As shown in Fig. 4C-D, Fig. 4G-H and
Supplemental Figure 3G, knockdown of CAMK2N1
increased R1881-induced PSA-Luc activity, whereas
addition of CAMKII inhibitor (KN-93) or AKT inhibitor
VIII abrogated the effects of CAMK2N1 knockdown on
AR activity. Conversely, overexpression of CAMK2N1
decreased R1881-induced PSA-Luc activity, while
transient transfection of LNCaP cells with constitutively
active CAMKIIβ or AKT (myrAKT) resulted in increased
PSA-Luc activity (Fig. 4E-F and Fig. 4I-J). This data
indicates that CAMK2N1-mediated suppression of
AR transactivation is dependent on CAMKII and AKT
signaling pathways.
We further analyzed the expression of CAMKIIα,
CAMKIIβ, CAMKIIγ and CAMKIIδ genes in prostate
cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2, DU145, and PC3) by
qRT-PCR (Supplemental Figure 3A-C). The prostate
cancer cells exhibited increased expression of CAMKIIβ
(Supplemental Figure 3A) compared to RWPE1, a normal
prostate cell line. CAMKIIα expression was not detected
in all prostate cell lines tested. Next, we used qRTPCR to determined whether suppression of CAMKII is
mediated by CAMK2N1. We observed that knockdown of
CAMK2N1 in LNCaP and C4-2 cells increased expression
of CAMKII, while overexpression of CAMK2N1 in
DU145 and PC3 cells decreased expression of CAMKII
(Supplemental Figure 3D-F). These findings indicate
that CAMK2N1 inhibits the expression of CAMKII
(particularly the CAMKIIβ isoform) in prostate cancer
cells.

cell growth [17]. AR antagonist Casodex, a pharmaceutical
drug commonly is used as an anti-androgen therapy to
treat recurrent prostate cancer. The growth of castrationsensitive cells is inhibited by Casodex. To further
investigate whether CAMK2N1 inhibition of castrationsensitive cell proliferation is dependent on AR, we
knocked down CAMK2N1 in LNCaP cells followed by
R1881 or Casodex treatment. As shown in Figure. 5AB, we observed that depletion of CAMK2N1 increased
LNCaP cell growth in the presence of R1881, while
alleviated inhibition of cell growth to Casodex. Taken
together, this data suggests that AR-dependent signaling
was involved in CAMK2N1 repression of castrationsensitive cell proliferation.
FACS analysis was performed to further characterize
the effects of CAMK2N1 on cell-cycle progression. We
knocked down CAMK2N1 in LNCaP cells followed by
R1881 treatment. Depletion of CAMK2N1 reduced the
proportion of cells in G0/G1 but increased the proportion
of cells in S-phase in the presence of R1881, while
androgen-deprivation alleviated the effects of knockdown
CAMK2N1, suggesting that AR-dependent signaling
was involved in CAMK2N1 repression of cell cycle
progression (Fig. 5C).

CAMK2N1 contributes to castration-resistant
cell growth through AR-dependent signaling, and
re-introduction of CAMK2N1 revert castrationresistance of prostate cancer cells
To further validate CAMK2N1-regulated signaling
pathways in CRPC cells, a subset of genes that were AR,
AKT, pAKTser473, Bcl-2, p21 and Bax were determined
by Western blot. Depletion of CAMK2N1 by shRNA in
C4-2 cells resulted in increased AR, pAKTser473, and
Bcl-2 expression and decreased p21 and Bax expression
(Fig. 6A). Conversely, overexpression of CAMK2N1 in
C4-2 cells led to an opposite effect on protein expression
of these genes (Fig. 6B).
AR has been reported to promote cell proliferation
and plays a critical role in the development of CRPC [3,
18]. Knockdown of AR in castration-resistant C4-2 cells
reduced cell growth [19]. To further investigate whether
CAMK2N1 inhibition of CRPC cell proliferation is
dependent on AR, we first knocked down CAMK2N1 in
C4-2 cells. Depletion of CAMK2N1 increased C4-2 cell
growth and promoted cell cycle progression (Fig. 6E,
Supplemental Fig. 4B). Furthermore, we overexpressed
CAMK2N1 with simultaneous depletion of AR in
C4-2 cells. CAMK2N1 inhibited cell proliferation in
the presence of endogenous AR (Fig. 6C), while AR
knockdown alleviated the CAMK2N1 repression. This
data suggests that AR-dependent signaling was involved
in CAMK2N1 repression of cell proliferation.
One of the hallmarks of prostate cancer treatment

CAMK2N1 contributes to castration-sensitive cell
growth through AR-dependent signaling
To determine the functional significance of
CAMK2N1 in regulating the proliferation of AR-positive
CSPC cells, we conducted MTT assays and found that
knockdown of CAMK2N1 in LNCaP cells using shRNAs
increased cell proliferation (Fig. 5A-B, Supplemental Fig.
4A).

failure is the development of castration resistance to antiandrogen therapies. Ligand-independent AR activation
contributed to the development of castration resistance
[18, 20]. It has been shown that AKT phosphorylation
and activity stimulated ligand-independent AR activation
could contribute to castration resistant growth of
prostate cancer cells [21, 22]. In our study, CAMK2N1mediated suppression of AR activation is dependent
on the AKT pathway. To explore whether CAMK2N1

inhibits ligand-independent AR activation and reverts
castration resistance, we conducted MTT assays in C4-2
cells treated with Casodex. As a competitive inhibitor of
AR, Casodex prevents androgen binding to the AR by
blocking its binding sites to the target gene promoter [23].
As a result, castration-resistant cells are refractory to this
treatment [24, 25]. As shown in Figure. 6D, we observed
that overexpression of CAMK2N1 induced inhibition
of growth to Casodex in castration-resistant C4–2 cells,

indicating that expression of CAMK2N1 can restore
Casodex sensitivity of prostate cancer cells.
Since elevated cell death may also contribute
to impaired tumor growth, we determined whether
CAMK2N1 induces apoptosis through AR by Annexin
V staining assays. We overexpressed CAMK2N1 with

simultaneous depletion of AR in C4-2 cells. CAMK2N1
induced cell apoptosis from 3%~8% in the presence of
endogenous AR, while AR knockdown alleviated the
CAMK2N1 induction from 8%~11% (Fig. 6F). This data
suggests that AR-dependent signaling was involved in
CAMK2N1 induction of cell apoptosis.

DISSCUSSION

in castration-resistant cells, indicating that re-expression
of CAMK2N1 can restore Casodex sensitivity of prostate
cancer cells. This study revealed a novel mechanism of
CAM2KN1 underlying the development of castration and
anti-androgen resistance.
In summary, we identify a biochemical and
functional link between CAMK2N1 with reduced
expression in advanced prostate cancer and androgen
receptor signaling in prostate cancer. Furthermore, loss
of CAMK2N1 expression contributes to prostate cancer
growth and survival independent of androgen signaling
and re-introduction of CAMK2N1 sensitizes castrationresistant prostate cancer cells to anti-androgen therapy.
Our results provide a compelling rationale for targeting
the functional interaction between CAMK2N1 and AR
signaling in clinical development to treat castrationresistant prostate cancer.

AR plays a critical role in the development of
CRPC. In CSPC, AR promotes cell proliferation through
regulation of the G1/S transition [3, 18]. In CRPC, AR is
thought to remain active through a variety of potential
mechanisms including AR gene amplification, mutations,
abnormal activation, and AR activator overexpression
[4, 18]. Upregulation of AR activation in the absence of
androgen is one of the mechanisms that lead to abnormal
AR activation, which promotes CRPC development [26].
It has been previously shown that AKT serves as positive
regulator of AR activity [22]. PI3K/AKT signaling
pathways cooperate in prostate cancer progression and its
transition to castration resistant disease [27]. Inhibition of
PI3K/AKT pathways acts combinatory to inhibit tumor
growth, cellular proliferation and migration of prostate
cancer [28]. Overexpression of CAMK2N1 suppressed
AKT and AR suggests that the loss of CAMK2N1 in
advanced prostate cancer could be the primary cause of
enhanced kinase signaling, which consequently leads to
abnormal activation of AR.
Patients with high levels of AR expression in their
tumors are usually associated with decreased recurrencefree survival [29]. Thus, blocking AR expression and
activation in clinical practice has become one of the most
effective approaches in prostate cancer therapy. Herein,
we provided evidence showing in human prostate cancer
tissue endogenous CAMK2N1 expression was inversely
correlated with AR. Recurrent patients with high AR levels
had an improved recurrence-free survival if their tumor
also expressed high CAMK2N1 protein levels. In prostate
cancer cells, CAMK2N1 and AR signaling form an autoregulatory negative feedback loop, where CAMK2N1
is down regulated by AR activation in response to
androgen, while CAMK2N1 inhibits AR expression and
activity through the CAMKII and AKT pathway. We
speculate that activation of AR upon androgen binding
inhibits CAMK2N1 gene expression in CSPC, and
androgen ablation therapy promoted the expression of
CAMK2N1, further causing inhibition of AR expression
and activation. At the CRPC stage, abnormal activation
of AR independent of androgen stimulus leads to the
reduced CAMK2N1 expression, which further enhances
AR expression and activation.
Androgen ablation therapy is the frontline treatment
for patients with advanced prostate cancers including
metastatic and castration-resistant diseases. Since the
majority of patients eventually develop castration-resistant
cancer despite of initial favorable response, identification
of molecules and mechanisms involved in castration
resistance is critical for developing effective treatment
of this deadly disease. We observed that knockdown of
CAMK2N1 alleviated inhibition of growth to Casodex
in castration-sensitive LNCaP cells and overexpression
of CAMK2N1 induces inhibition of growth to Casodex

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, Plasmid construction, Reporter
genes, Reagents, Expression vectors, and DNA
transfection
Human prostate cancer LNCaP cells were obtained
from ATCC and maintained in in RPMI 1640 medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS or 10% charcoal/
dextran stripped FBS (cFBS). C4-2 was maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
FBS. The CAMK2N1 human cDNA clone was purchased
from OriGene Technologies and subcloned into the EcoRI/
XhoI site of MSCV-IRES-GFP (Addgen) retroviral
vector. pGIPZ lentiviral vector, pGIPZ-shCAMK2N1-1
(shCA-1,
5’-TCAATAACAACCCGCTTGC-3’),
pGIPZ-shCAMK2N1-3
(shCA-3,
5’-TAGACACCAGGAGGTGCCT-3’) were purchased
from Thermo Scientific. PSA-Luc MMTV-Luc, ARE4Luc reporter genes were described [30]. AKT inhibitor
VIII was purchased from Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA).
LNCaP infected with GIPZ-Vector, shCA-1, shCA-3. C4-2
infected with MSCV-IRES-GFP, MSCV-CAMK2N1IRES-GFP, pGIPZ-Vector, shCA-1, shCA-3. GFP positive
cells were selected by FACS (Fluorescence Activated cell
sorter).

Cell Proliferation Assays
2×103 stable cells were seeded in 96-well plate in
normal growth medium, and cell growth was measured
daily by MTT assays using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide.

Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Analysis

RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) Assays

Cell cycle parameters were determined by flow
cytometry. Stable cells were processed by standard
methods using propidium iodide staining of nuclear DNA.
Each sample was analyzed by flow cytometry with a
FACScan Flow Cytometer (Becton-Dickinson Biosciences,
Mansfield, MA) using a 488 nm laser. Histograms were
analyzed for cell cycle compartments using ModFit
version 2.0 (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). A
minimum of 20,000 events were collected to maximize
statistical validity of the compartmental analysis. The PEAnnexin-V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences) was
used to detect apoptosis by flow cytometry [31].

Total RNA was isolated and reversely transcribed
to cDNA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and iScript
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions [35]. qRT-PCR was carried out in Bio-Rad
CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System with iQ SYBR
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Relative gene expression
was normalized to 18s rRNA and calculated by using the
2-∆∆Ct method.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining

Western Blot
Western blots were performed on DU145, PC3 and
LNCaP cells as indicated. Cells were pelleted and lysed
in buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Tween 20)
supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Antibodies used for
Western blots were: CAMK2N1 (SC-161427, Santa Cruz)
and AR (SC-13062, Santa Cruz).

Immunohistochemical analysis of human prostate
cancer was conducted using a polyclonal CAMK2N1
antibody 8. Human prostate cancer tissue arrays were
purchased from Biomax. FOUR-micrometer sections
were prepared from paraffin-embedded C4-2 Tumor
tissues derived from nude mice, and tissues were extracted
from paraffin. Tumor tissues were stained with primary
antibody including Ki67 (RM-9106-S1, Thermo), Bcl-2
(SC-7382, Santa cruz), Bax (SC-7480, Santa cruz), p21
(SC-6246, Santa cruz).

Luciferase Assays

Nude Mice Study

Cells were seeded at a density of 1 x 105 cells in a
24-well cell culture plate on the day prior to transfection
with Superfect according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For reporter gene assays, a doseresponse was determined in each experiment with 50
and 200 ng of expression vector and promoter reporter
plasmids (0.5 μg). Luciferase activity was normalized for
transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase reporter as
an internal control. The fold effect of expression vector
was determined with comparison to the value of the empty
expression vector cassette and statistical analyses were
performed using the t-test [32, 33].

2 × 106 C4-2 cells knockdown CAMK2N1 were
implanted subcutaneously into 4-6-week-old castrated mal
nude mice purchased from Beijing HFK Bio-Technology.
co., LTD. Tumor growth was measured using a digital
caliper every 5 days for 4-5 weeks. Tumor weight was
measured when mice were sacrificed on day 32 after cell
implantation.
