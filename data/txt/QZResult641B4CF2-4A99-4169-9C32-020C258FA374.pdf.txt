Abstract
Many cancer drugs impact cancer cell redox regulatory mechanisms and disrupt redox homeostasis.
Pharmacodynamic biomarkers that measure therapeutic efﬁcacy or toxicity could improve patient management.
Using immunoblot analyses and mass spectrometry, we identiﬁed that serpins A1 and A3 were S-glutathionylated
in a dose- and time-dependent manner following treatment of mice with drugs that alter reactive oxygen or
nitrogen species. Tandem mass spectrometry analyses identiﬁed Cys256 of serpin A1 and Cys263 of serpin A3 as the
S-glutathionylated residues. In human plasma from cancer patients, there were higher levels of unmodiﬁed serpin
A1 and A3, but following treatments with redox active drugs, relative S-glutathionylation of these serpins was
higher in plasma from normal individuals. There is potential for S-glutathionylated serpins A1 and A3 to act as
pharmacodynamic biomarkers for evaluation of patient response to drugs that target redox pathways. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Preclinical and early clinical testing of novel anticancer
drugs can be signiﬁcantly enabled by the inclusion of direct
or surrogate biomarkers that correlate with pharmacologic
effects (1, 2). Incorporation of such biomarkers can enhance
data interpretation, provide an explanation for either positive
or negative correlations with efﬁcacy or toxicity, and aid in
early decision candidate selection. In complex diseases such as
cancer, recent trends in drug development have moved toward
targeted therapies to provide maximal therapeutic response
while minimizing side effects. Failure of early stage clinical
trials incurs great expense and there is merit in including
biomarkers, both to estimate treatment efﬁcacy and to identify
patients with phenotypic characteristics that might predict
response outcomes or toxicities.
In evaluating drug response, a single biomarker can lend
itself to quantitative measurements through dose and time
response studies. The metabolism of many drugs leads to
production of electrophilic species that can generate reactive

oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS; RNS). These can directly
inﬂuence redox balance in both blood and tissue compartments. Biologic sensing of redox changes is most actively
monitored through select cysteine residues in various proteins.
Although there is debate as to the precise deﬁnition of what
constitutes redox sensing versus redox signaling (3), there is
little doubt that cysteines at various oxidation states are
integral. S-glutathionylation is a posttranslational modiﬁcation that occurs when a cysteine in a low pK environment
forms a disulﬁde bond with GS. This is reversible and the
resultant S-glutathionylation cycle has the potential to selectively regulate the function of numerous enzymes, receptors,
structural proteins, transcription factors, and transport proteins. Moreover, posttranslational modiﬁcation may alter a
variety of protein–protein interactions (4). The activities of
serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are regulated by modiﬁcations of key cysteines (5, 6), in which, for example, S-glutathionylation of serpin A1 results in conformational changes that
weaken its afﬁnity for its target protease, thereby reducing its
effectiveness in preventing proteolytic activity (7).
Vertebrate serpins are classiﬁed into 6 subgroups and
represent approximately 2% of the total protein in human
plasma (8). Although most are deﬁned by their inhibitory
activities, certain serpins have noninhibitory roles as hormone
transporters (9), molecular chaperones (10), or tumor suppressors (11). Moreover, serpins can inﬂuence myeloproliferation and hematopoetic progenitor cell mobilization. Serpins A1
and A3 have redox-sensitive cysteines and are downregulated
in bone marrow during mobilization of hematopoetic progenitor cells into the peripheral bloodstream (12), implicating a
regulatory function for S-glutathionylation and redox homeostasis in the marrow compartment. This is consistent with the

fact that certain redox active drugs [including the glutathione
disulﬁde mimetic NOV-002 (13) and the GSH peptidomimetic,
Telintra (14)] have both preclinical and clinical myeloproliferative effects (15).
In this study, we have identiﬁed the S-glutathionylation of
plasma serpins A1 and A3 as potential quantiﬁable response
biomarkers for assessing response to 2 different types of drugs
that either directly or indirectly impact redox status. NOV-002
is a formulation of disodium glutathione disulﬁde (GSSG) that
in combination protocols is in phase II trials for the treatment
of breast cancer. NOV-002 causes a redox regulation of protein
thiols that persists in plasma for approximately 4 hours and in
rodents and humans stimulates proliferation of bone marrow
progenitor cells (13). PABA/NO is a diazeniumdiolate that
acts as a direct nitrogen monoxide (NO) donor and is in
development as an anticancer drug. We show that plasma
serpin S-glutathionylation correlates with drug treatment in
vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, analysis of cancer patient
plasma samples suggests disease-speciﬁc variation in unmodiﬁed and S-glutathionylated serpin proﬁles correlating with
drug concentrations.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Reduced GSH was from Sigma, NOV-002 provided by Novelos Therapeutics, and PABA/NO from Dr. Larry Keefer (National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, MD; refs. 16, 17).
Animal and human plasma studies
Mice were treated with an intravenous bolus of 25 mg/kg
NOV-002 and after 1 hour blood was collected via orbital bleed in
heparin-coated tubes. Plasma was separated by centrifugation
and proteins separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred for immunoblot analyses. Human blood samples were obtained with
informed consent from 8 cancer-free volunteers and 47 oncology
patients with various types/stages of cancer: 20 acute myeloid
leukemia (AML); 10 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); 1
multiple myeloma (MM); 4 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS);
3 chronic lymphoblastic leukemia; 1 chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML); 2 lung carcinomas; 2 urothelial carcinomas; 1 leiomyosarcoma; 1 neuroblastoma; 1 spindle cell carcinoma, 1 invasive
ductal carcinoma. Eight to 10 cc of blood was collected into
Vacutainer tubes containing EDTA. Plasma was separated via
centrifugation and treated with NOV-002 or PABA/NO at 37 C.
Immunoblot analysis
Equal amounts of puriﬁed recombinant serpins A1/A3
or total plasma protein, as determined by Bradford assay
(Bio-Rad Laboratories), were separated on nonreducing
SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and
probed with a monoclonal anti-GSSG antibody (Virogen) to
detect S-glutathionylation, or polyclonal antibodies for serpins
A1 and A3 (R&D systems), glutaredoxin1 (Abcam) or GSTP
(MBL). Equal loading was estimated by polyclonal rabbit
albumin antibody (Abcam). Secondary antibodies were from
Amersham Biosciences.

Identiﬁcation of S-glutathionylated plasma proteins
Plasma S-glutathionylated protein bands were isolated
from gels run simultaneously with immunoblots and trypsin
digested. Peptide mass was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization, time-of-ﬂight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry at the Proteomics Core Facility. Protein identiﬁcation
was done using software from the NCBI protein database.
Immunoprecipitation
Human plasma samples (2 mg) were treated with 50 mmol/L
of NOV-002 for 60 minutes at 37 C. Biotinylated rabbit polyclonal antibodies to serpins A1 and A3 (Abcam, 5 mg) were used
to pull-down respective proteins by overnight incubations at
4 C. Antibody complexes were isolated through incubation
with NeutrAvidin agarose resin (Thermo Scientiﬁc) for 2 hours.
Resin-bound complexes were washed 5 with immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mmol/L HEPES, 300 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
Triton, 10% glycerol) and proteins eluted in nonreducing SDSsample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated
by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and S-glutathionylation of serpins
A1 and A3 evaluated by immunoblot.
In vitro S-glutathionylation assays
Puriﬁed serpin A1 or A3 (50 ng) was incubated at 37 C in 50
mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 1 mmol/L GSH
with either NOV-002 or PABA/NO. Samples were run on
nonreducing SDS-PAGE gels for subsequent transfer and
immunoblot analysis.
Tandem mass spectroscopy
Puriﬁed serpins A1 and A3 were treated with 100 mmol/L
PABA/NO or 1 mmol/L NOV-002 for 30 minutes at 37 C,
digested with Lys-C and analyzed via liquid chromatography
(LC)–electrospray ionization (ESI)–tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ,
Thermo Finnigan) coupled to an LC Packings nano LC system.
S-glutathionylated serpin A3 peptides required additional
trypsin digestion (See Supplementary Data for instrument
settings).
Spectroscopic analysis of serpin A1 and A3 in vitro
The effect of serpin S-glutathionylation on enzyme secondary structure was examined by circular dichroism (CD) measurements carried out on a 202 AVIV Associates CD spectrometer using a semi-micro quartz rectangular 1  10  40 mm
cuvette. Serpins A1 and A3 (2 mg/mL) were S-glutathionylated by treatment with 40 mmol/L PABA/NO and 1 mmol/L
GSH for 30 minutes in 20 mmol/L PB, pH 7.4, at 37 C. Excess
PABA/NO and GSH were eliminated using Biospin-6 (Bio-Rad)
SEC micro-spin columns.
Puriﬁed native and S-glutathionylated serpins A1 and A3
(95% homogeneous, 40 mmol/L in 20 mmol/L PB, pH 7.4)
were maintained at 22 C using a Pelletier element. Spectra
were recorded while scanning in the far-ultraviolet region
(190–260 nm), with bandwidth of 1.0 nm, step size of 0.5 nm,
integration time of 30 seconds. Protein tryptophanyl ﬂuorescence was recorded on a QM-4 spectroﬂuorometer (PTI) using
10  10  40-mm quartz cuvette, excitation and 2.5 and 5.0 nm

were trypsin digested and peptide mass analyzed by MALDITOF. Protein identiﬁcation (Fig. 1C, Table) used software from
the NCBI protein database. Complement C3 appears as a
common S-glutathionylated protein throughout the analysis,
even before drug treatments. Proteins bands B and D were
identiﬁed as serpin A1, whereas band C was identiﬁed as serpin
A3. Murine contrapsin is homologous to human serpin A3. Ex
vivo treatment of mouse plasma with various concentrations of
NOV-002 showed similar S-glutathionylation induction. Quantiﬁcation of band densities showed increasing serpin S-glutathionylation with dose exposure (Fig. 1B).
Extending these analyses, puriﬁed human plasma samples
were similarly treated ex vivo with NOV-002. Anti-PSSG immunoblots showed the induction of several distinct S-glutathionylated protein bands with a proﬁle similar to in vitro and in
vivo in mouse plasma assays. Basal levels of S-glutathionylated
proteins were detected in both mouse and human untreated
samples, most likely the result of ex vivo processing. Treatment
with 40 mmol/L NOV-002 caused a time-dependent increase
in the relative amount (as normalized to albumin loading
control) of S-glutathionylated proteins that peaked between
approximately 40 to 60 minutes and gradually decreased with

emission slits. To minimize effects of protein tyrosines and
phenylalanines, an excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used.
Background spectra were subtracted from ﬁnal emission data.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software). P values lower than 0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant. Parametric data were statistically evaluated using t
tests and nonparametric data were evaluated using Mann–
Whitney or Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test tests,
based on data distribution. Multiple comparisons were analyzed using ANOVAs with Dunnett's Multiple Comparison tests
or Kruskall–Wallis tests with Dunn's multiple Comparsion test.
Corrections were applied based on program recommendation.
Relative S-glutathionylation levels induced in cancer were
analyzed using 2-way ANOVAs.

Results
In vivo treatment with NOV-002 leads to S-glutathionylation
of a limited subset of plasma proteins in mice (Fig. 1A).
Immunoblots from animals detected 4 prevalent S-glutathionylated proteins within 15 minutes of treatment. Excised bands

Figure 1. NOV-002 treatment induces serpin A1 and A3 S-glutathionylation in vivo in mouse plasma and ex vivo in human plasma. Immunoblot analyses of
S-glutathionylated proteins (PSSG) from wild-type mice treated in vivo with an intravenous bolus of 25 mg/kg NOV-002 at time points following 1 hour
(A) and wild-type mouse plasma treated ex vivo with various concentrations of NOV-002 (B). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identiﬁed S-glutathionylated
mouse plasma proteins (C). Human plasma was treated ex vivo with 40 mmol/L NOV-002 for 0 to 240 minutes and evaluated by immunoblot for
S-glutathionylated proteins (D). Albumin immunoblotting determined equal protein loading. For immunoprecipitation (IP), human plasma was treated
with 40 mmol/L NOV-002 for 1 hour and biotinylated serpin A1 and A3 antibodies were used to pull-down total unmodiﬁed and modiﬁed serpins.
S-glutathionylated proteins were evaluated by immunoblot (E). Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-serpin A1 or A3 as a loading control. Due to high
homology, there is signiﬁcant cross reactivity of anti-A1 and A3. IB, immunoblot.

were needed to induce minimum (at 25 mmol/L PABA/NO)
and maximum (at 75 mmol/L PABA/NO) S-glutathionylation
levels of both serpins A1 and A3. However, drug-induced Sglutathionylation levels of serpin A3 became relatively saturated between 25 and 50 mmol/L PABA/NO, suggesting that
serpin A3 S-glutathionylation may be more time dependent.
We evaluated the effects of S-glutathionylation on serpin
secondary structure. Tryptophanyl ﬂuorescence of serpin A3
was lower than that of serpin A1 indicating a quenching in the
former. Tryptophanyl ﬂuorescence of S-glutathionylated serpin A3 had an increased intensity and a shift of emission
maximum from 328 to 336 nm, interpreted as tryptophanyl
exposure to a more polar environment, decrease of quenching
and structural change (Fig. 2C). The CD spectrum (far UV, 190–
260 nm) of S-glutathionylated serpin A1 was similar to that of
native protein, consistent with a minimal increase in the
a-helical content (206–220 nm) of the protein (Fig. 2D). This
suggested a minor decrease in tryptophanyl ﬂuorescence
caused by S-glutathionylation, indicating a reasonably intact
tertiary and quaternary structure. In contrast, the CD spectrum
of S-glutathionylated serpin A3 was distinct from that of the
native protein, consistent with an increase in the b-strand
content of the protein and altered protein folding (Fig. 2D).
These ﬂuorescent analyses conﬁrmed that S-glutathionylation
affects the tertiary structure of serpin A3.
S-glutathionylated recombinant serpins A1 and A3 were
analyzed using MS/MS to identify S-glutathionylated cysteines.
Puriﬁed recombinant serpins A1 and A3 were incubated at

additional time (Fig. 1D). This indicated a relatively rapid
turnover rate involving the S-glutathionylation and deglutathionylation of proteins following drugs.
Immunoprecipitation of serpins A1 and A3 from human
plasma conﬁrmed that both these proteins are S-glutathionylated (Fig. 1E). Due to high sequence homology (46%)
between human serpins A1 and A3, a certain extent of antibody
cross-reactivity may be anticipated. In particular, the immunoprecipitating serpin A3 antibody also pulled down serpin A1,
as evidenced in the PSSG blot. Protein bands correspond with
the approximate expected molecular weights of serpins A1 and
A3 (seen on PSSG immunoblots). Detection of multiple protein
bands on immunoblots probed with serpin antibodies is not
uncommon. Serpins and serpin/protease complexes undergo
gradual proteolysis at the serpin active site producing cleavage
products, perhaps explaining the multiple protein bands
detected on serpin immunoblots (18).
Puriﬁed recombinant A1 and A3 protein was treated in vivo
and in vitro with agents known to induce protein S-glutathionylation (13, 19). In the presence of PABA/NO and GSH, both
serpins A1 and A3 were S-glutathionylated in a time- (Fig. 2A)
and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Serpin A1 was
rapidly S-glutathionylated within 1 minute and peaked at
approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Following this, S-glutathionylated protein levels gradually declined. Alternatively, serpin A3
showed a more gradual increase in S-glutathionylation over a
30-minute time course, suggesting unique protein properties
despite high sequence homology. Similar drug concentrations

37 C for 30 minutes the presence of 100 mmol/L PABA/NO and
10 mmol/L GSH. Analyses of (RLGMFNIQHCK) of serpin A1
(Fig. 3A and B) indicated that an additional approximately 305
Da at Cys256, representing GSH, in addition to the Cys alone
(103 Da) and water (18 Da), was present only in the drugtreated serpin A1 (Fig. 3B). MS/MS analyses similarly identiﬁed
Cys263 of (DEELSCTVVELK; Fig. 3C and D) treated serpin A3 to
be modiﬁed by the addition of GSH, indicated by an additional
approximately 305 Da (Fig. 3D). These data provided a platform
to develop analytical methods for quantiﬁcation of S-glutathionylated serpins in biologic ﬂuids.
Human plasma samples from 47 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatments and 8 cancer-free patients
were analyzed for total and S-gluathionylated serpin A1 and
A3 protein. Immunoblot densitometry showed signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.05) elevated amounts of each unmodiﬁed serpin in
cancer patients (Fig. 4A and B). All protein bands were
normalized to an albumin loading control as well as an
internal standard, permitting comparison across membranes. Levels of S-glutathionylated serpins A1 and A3
did not correlate with total serpin levels. In fact, serpin
S-glutathionylation proﬁles were distinct between patients,
suggesting that individual patients with speciﬁc disease and
treatment proﬁles have unique serpin S-glutathionylation.
However, when analyzing all cancers in a group, the overall
ratio of S-glutathionylated serpin A1 (PSSGa and PSSGc) and
A3 (PSSGb) to unmodiﬁed serpin A1 and A3, respectively,
was signiﬁcantly decreased (P < 0.05) in cancer patients
(Fig. 4C). Thus, in reference to the total amount of serpin, the
fraction of serpin protein subject to S-glutathionylation was
lower in cancer patients. Table 1 summarizes the relative
fold change in protein expression of unmodiﬁed serpins and
S-glutathionylated serpins in total cancer as compared with
cancer-free, in addition to AML and ALL as individual
groups. While general trends remain consistent between
all cancers, discrepancies in signiﬁcance may suggest disease-speciﬁc proﬁles. Of particular interest, levels of basal
S-glutathionylated serpins were signiﬁcantly lower in ALL
patients as compared with AML and cancers as a group.
Ex vivo treatment of patient plasma with NOV-002 for 60
minutes at 100 mmol/L proportionally enhanced levels of
S-glutathionylated A1 and A3 [Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary Fig. S1 (lighter exposures)]. Figure 5B shows the relative
quantities of S-glutathionylated serpin A1 (PSSGa and PSSGc)
and A3 (PSSGb) after NOV-002 treatment from samples of 47
cancer and 8 cancer-free patients, determined by densitometry
measurements normalized to both albumin loading controls
and an internal standard incorporated on all gels. S-glutathionylated serpin A1 (PSSGa and PSSGc) and A3 (PSSGb) levels
were signiﬁcantly increased (P < 0.05) in response to NOV-002.
Two-way ANOVA analyses show that ex vivo treatment of
plasma with 100 mmol/L NOV-002 resulted in signiﬁcantly
higher relative increases (P < 0.05) in serpin A1 S-glutathionylation (PSSGa/A1 and PSSGc/A1) in cancer-free plasma as
compared with cancer patients (Fig. 5C). Thus, in response to
treatment, serpin S-glutathionylation and disease status are
interrelated and showed altered redox homeostasis in cancer
patients. NOV-002 treatment also induced S-glutathionylation

www.aacrjournals.org

of albumin, as evidenced by the doublet band detected only at
high drug concentrations. Critically, NOV-002 treatment did
not alter serpin stability, as indicated by total serpin immunoblotting. Treatment with 40 mmol/L NOV-002 for 0 to 240
minutes did not change levels of unmodiﬁed serpin A1 or A3 (P
> 0.05) (Fig. 5D). Additional analyses using treated and untreated plasma samples from cancer and cancer-free patients
supported these data (Fig. 5E). Treatment with Velcade,
vinblastine, Taxol, or tamoxifen did not induce changes in
plasma serpin A1 or A3 S-glutathionylation (Supplementary
Fig. S2A–D).
GSTP and Grx1 are involved in the forward and reverse
reactions of S-glutathionylation. Relative protein levels were
determined via densitometry and then normalized to an
albumin loading control, as well as an internal standard
incorporated into all gels. Plasma protein levels of GSTP
were signiﬁcantly decreased (P < 0.05) in cancer patients as
compared with cancer free. Conversely, plasma Grx1 levels
were signiﬁcantly elevated (P < 0.05) in cancer patients (Fig.
6). These data are consistent with the interpretation that
the decreased relative ratio of S-glutathionylated to unmodiﬁed serpin in cancer patient plasma may be linked with
diminished GSTP levels and a relatively enhanced rate of
serpin deglutathionylation, as a consequence of elevated
Grx1.

Discussion
There is expanding interest in adopting a redox-modulating
platform in drug discovery/development in cancer (20). In this
study we used 2 drugs that alter redox homeostasis through
distinct mechanisms. NOV-002 is an oxidized glutathione
mimetic that modiﬁes extra- and intracellular ratio of GSH:
GSSG (13, 21). PABA/NO releases NO to raise levels of RNS and
ROS (19). Increased efﬁcacy and limited off-target toxicities
could be facilitated by the identiﬁcation of plausible pharmacodynamic biomarkers (preferably through noninvasive
approaches) that serve as predictors of drug response. Initially
using mice, we identiﬁed S-glutathionylated serpins A1 and A3
as quantiﬁable response biomarkers. These preclinical observations were extended to human plasma samples in which
correlative associations with drug exposure and disease status
were identiﬁed. Moreover, variations in the expression of
unmodiﬁed and/or S-glutathionylated serpin proﬁles were
identiﬁed and may reﬂect aberrant redox homeostasis in some
cancers.
Because of the variable valence states of sulfur, cysteinetargeted oxidation has evolved as a critical regulator of protein
function in a number of signal transduction pathways. Protein
S-glutathionylation is cyclical in nature [the forward reaction is
catalyzed by GST, the reverse by glutaredoxin (22)], providing
the framework for reversible signaling (23). A number of
protein clusters with roles in cell survival pathways are
characteristically sensitive to posttranslational modiﬁcation,
including enzymes with catalytically important cysteines, signaling proteins, and transcription factors. Serine proteinase
inhibitors are susceptible to modulation by redox conditions
(7, 24, 25). MS/MS analyses identiﬁed Cys256 of serpinA1 and

Cys263 of serpin A3 as S-glutathionylation targets. Cys256 of fulllength serpin A1 has previously been shown to be redox
sensitive (7, 26). However, the present data provided are the
ﬁrst to report a similar redox-sensitive cysteine in serpin A3.
Oxidation of cysteine residues in serpins inhibits their activity
(7, 24–26). From a functional basis, members of the serpin
family are involved in regulation of myeloproliferation and
hematopoetic progenitor cell (HPC) mobilization (12, 27).

Downregulation of serpins A1 and A3 in bone marrow occurs
during progenitor cell mobilization and inﬂuences marrow
microenvironment and migratory behavior of HPCs (12). Our
data show that serpin A1 and A3 S-glutathionylation following
NOV-002 or PABA/NO treatment alters their structure, and
such factors may alter the role of serpins involved in myeloproliferative pathways. To interrogate the speciﬁcity of
these effects for ROS/RNS active drugs, we investigated

Figure 5. Ex vivo treatment with NOV-002 induces serpin A1 and A3 S-glutathionylation and results in greater relative increases in serpin A1 glutathionylation
in cancer-free human plasma. Cancer (samples 2–8) and cancer-free (sample 1) human plasma samples were treated with 100 mmol/L NOV-002 for
60 minutes (A). S-glutathionylation (PSSG), serpin A1, serpin A3, and albumin levels (loading control) were evaluated by immunoblot. Levels of Sglutathionylated serpin A1 (PSSGa and PSSGc) and serpin A3 (PSSGb) after NOV-002 treatment (both cancer and cancer free) were determined by
densitometry normalized to both albumin loading controls and an internal standard on all gels (B). Relative S-glutathionylation levels in reference to total
unmodiﬁed serpin levels induced in response to NOV-002 treatment in cancer patient plasma as compared with those induced in cancer-free plasma
were analyzed using 2-way ANOVAs (C). To conﬁrm that S-glutathionylation of serpins does not alter serpin A1 and A3 protein stability, plasma was treated
with 40 mmol/L NOV-002 for 0 to 240 minutes (D). The relative quantity of serpins A1 and A3 in treated and untreated samples (both cancer and cancer free)
after 100 mmol/L NOV-002 treatment for 1 hour was normalized to both albumin loading controls and an internal standard on all gels (E). Data are mean for 8

(Supplementary Fig. S2) the effects of Velcade (proteasome
inhibitor), vinblastine and Taxol (antimicrotubule drugs), or
tamoxifen (estrogen receptor antagonist). Although these
drugs may produce low levels of ROS indirectly, the data
suggest that there is no dose effect response on plasma serpin
S-glutathionylation proﬁles.
Immunoblots of S-glutathionylated serpins revealed proteins of various molecular weights. Different segments of the
A1 molecule may possess unique biologic properties that may
or may not be linked to protease inhibitor activity. Low
molecular weight fragments of serpin A1, generated by complexing with neutrophil elastase or by macrophage metalloelastase attack, possess chemoattractant properties (28). In this
context, serpin S-glutathionylation may have a mechanistic
connection with the in vivo myeloproliferative activity of

NOV-002 (13). The redox-sensitive serpin, bomapin, is directly
involved in the responsiveness of myeloid progenitor cells to
their microenvironment (29). Posttranslational regulation of
serpins in the peripheral circulation may indicate a role in the
control of proteolytic pathways. Whatever the functional association, as the plasma half-life of S-glutathionylated proteins is
approximately 4 hours (19), our mouse studies provided evidence that these posttranslationally modiﬁed proteins could
be viable as pharmacodynamic biomarkers in a clinical setting.
There is precedent for using posttranslationally modiﬁed
proteins as biomarkers. In initial trials of the CML therapeutic
imatinib levels of phosphorylated CRKL correlated directly
with BCR-ABL inhibition and proved useful in determining
appropriate dosing strategies (30, 31). In addition, success of
small-molecule inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor

protein and elevated levels of Grx1. Human plasma samples from cancerfree patients (represented in lanes 1 and 3) and cancer patients

(geﬁtinib, erlotinib) and Src kinases (dasatinib) can be linked
with phosphorylation of downstream markers such as ERK1/2,
FAK, or paxillin (32, 33).
Our patient proﬁle data showed that baseline protein
levels of both serpin A1 and A3 were elevated in the plasma
of cancer patients. Elevated serpin A1 expression in tumors
has been correlated with poor prognosis and highly invasive,
metastatic adenocarcinomas (34–36) and with poor
response in MM (37). Although the functional importance
of serpins A1 and A3 in cancer is not yet clearly deﬁned,
serpin A1 has inhibitory activity against cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (38), suggesting that the
tumor-promoting effect of serpin A1 could be related to a
decreased immune response against malignant cells. Serpin
A1 overexpression may also be a useful biomarker in insulinomas (39). In leukemias, in which the cancer is of bone
marrow origin, further deﬁning a role of serpin A1 and A3
S-glutathionylation in myeloproliferation may be valuable
with regard to development of tailored treatment strategies.
Chronic oxidative stress, characterized by excessive cellular
ROS levels, occurs in several hematopoietic malignancies
including ALL, MDS, CML, and AML (40–42). While ROS is
involved in normal hematopoiesis, imbalances of ROS
results in redox dysregulation and may inﬂuence downstream redox-mediated signaling events, including S-glutathionylation of serpins. Our data suggest that ALL patients
have lower basal levels of glutathionylated serpins A1 and
A3, perhaps indicating that certain myeloid leukemias might
respond preferentially to redox-targeted therapeutics.
Analyses of cancer patients as a group showed that their
overall ratio of S-glutathionylated serpins to unmodiﬁed
serpins was decreased. Furthermore, ex vivo drug-induced
S-glutathionylation was blunted in cancer patient plasma,
results consistent with a disrupted redox homeostasis associated with cancer. High levels of oxidative stress markers in
patient sera often correlate with similar markers within
tumors, suggesting the usefulness of patient serum in assessing redox state. Further correlative analysis of patient
samples estimated levels of enzymes associated with the

www.aacrjournals.org

forward and reverse reactions of the S-glutathionylation
cycle. Levels of GSTP (forward reaction) were signiﬁcantly
decreased in cancer patient plasma compared with cancer
free, whereas Grx1 (reverse reaction) levels were elevated.
These results are consistent with the relative ratios of
S-glutathionylated to unmodiﬁed serpin proteins found in
cancer patient plasma samples. Modulation of Grx1 levels,
either by overexpression or RNAi knockdown, directly inﬂuences S-glutathionylation of inhibitory NF-kb kinase by
respectively decreasing or catalyzing its posttranslational
modiﬁcation (43). However, reports indicate a dual role for
Grx1, as a glutathionylating enzyme under ROS or as a
deglutathionylase when the oxidative signal or stress subsides (44). Earlier results have shown that the glutathione
conjugate of cisplatin can inhibit the enzyme activity of Grx
(45). However, there were no indications that the parent
drug (or related platinum analogs) had inhibitory effects.
The drug concentrations used in this study are generally too
low to cause enzyme inhibition, either for GSTP (13) or of
Grx (45).
This article provides evidence supporting the usefulness of
posttranslationally modiﬁed serpins as pharmacodynamic
biomarkers. Optimization of detection and characterization
protocols will provide promising opportunity in a clinical
setting in which serpin S-glutathionylation may be directly
used to infer patient response to redox-modulating therapeutics. The ability to detect S-glutathionylated serpin peptides, as
we have shown in our MS/MS studies, may provide a platform
to develop increased sensitivity of detection for quantiﬁcation
of S-glutathionylated serpins in biologic ﬂuids.
