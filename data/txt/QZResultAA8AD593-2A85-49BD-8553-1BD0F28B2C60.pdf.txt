BACKGROUND: Premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy are at risk for amenorrhea and impaired fertility.
The objective of the current study was to assess levels of mullerian inhibitory substance (MIS), estradiol (E2), folliclestimulating hormone (FSH), and menstrual status, in women undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: A nested
prospective cohort study was conducted in women aged <40 years with breast cancer (BC) who were undergoing
adjuvant chemotherapy (n ¼ 26). Serum MIS, FSH, and E2 were measured before chemotherapy (baseline) and at
Weeks 6, 12, 36, and 52. Controls were 134 age-matched women with known fertility. Hormone levels were compared
between the cases and controls at baseline. Differences between amenorrhea and age subgroups were tested using
the nonparametric Wilcoxon 2-sample test using a 2-sided a of 0.05. RESULTS: Subjects with BC and age-matched
controls had similar baseline MIS levels (median, 0.94 ng/mL vs 0.86 ng/mL;, P > .05). Serum MIS decreased significantly at 6 weeks and remained suppressed for 52 weeks. E2 levels decreased, and FSH levels increased during
chemotherapy; however, at 52 weeks, the levels returned to baseline. At 52 weeks, only 1 patient had MIS above the
lower normal range, 15 had return of menstrual function, 11 had premenopausal levels of FSH, and 13 had follicular
phase levels of E2. In women aged <35 years, 25% remained amenorrheic, whereas in women aged >35 years, 50%
were amenorrheic. Amenorrheic and menstruating women were found to have similar MIS values at baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In young women with BC, chemotherapy decreases MIS rapidly and dramatically. Rapid
reductions in MIS do not appear to be predictive of subsequent menstrual function. Ovarian reserve and endocrine

Due to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of early breast cancer (BC) there are now more than 2.4 million

BC survivors in the United States.1 Premenopausal women diagnosed with BC are often concerned about long-term consequences of chemotherapy, such as early menopause and infertility.2,3 Even for women who remain premenopausal after
chemotherapy, there is an increased risk of early onset menopause compared with women with BC who do not receive
chemotherapy.4 The risk of chemotherapy-related amenorrhea (CRA), menopause, and infertility are associated with
patient age and type of treatment received, with age >40 years being the strongest predictor of ovarian failure.5 For
women aged <40 years, identifying patients early who are at greatest risk of CRA may alter treatment decisions; therefore,
early predictors of CRA risk are needed.
Serum mullerian inhibitory substance (MIS), also known as anti-mullerian hormone, has emerged as a valuable
marker for ovarian reserve in healthy women and helps to predict oocyte quality and yield in in vitro fertilization (IVF).6
MIS is secreted by ovarian granulosa cells of primordial, preantral, and small antral follicles. After puberty and before perimenopause, the MIS level remains stable in healthy women. MIS levels are consistent throughout the menstrual cycle and
correlate well with other markers, such as antral follicle counts (AFC), and measurements of inhibin B.7 MIS is considered

to be a direct marker of ovarian reserve, as it is produced
by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-sensitive early
antral follicles. It has been suggested that MIS may be a
more sensitive predictor of ovarian reserve than the other
markers.
Published studies evaluating fertility preservation
methods have used menstrual status and traditional
markers of ovarian endocrine function such as estradiol
(E2) and FSH to help predict future fertility potential.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been a
paucity of data regarding how menstrual status, ovarian
endocrine function, or markers of ovarian reserve are
affected by chemotherapy and if any hormonal parameters
help predict future fertility potential. In a prior study of
20 cancer survivors who maintained menses after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, MIS and AFC were found to
be lower than in age-matched controls. The authors concluded that further studies should assess the predictive
value of these markers for pregnancy potential in this
population.8
The primary objective of the current study was to
evaluate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on markers
of ovarian reserve and endocrine function in women with
BC who were aged <40 years. We evaluated the predictive
potential of changes in these biomarkers for determining
future menstrual status.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects were premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant
chemotherapy for early stage BC who participated in a
randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase 3 trial comparing zoledronic acid (at a dose of 4 mg intravenously every 3 months) versus placebo for 1 year.9 Patients were
enrolled from March 2002 to June 2006 after surgery but
before the initiation of chemotherapy. At the time of
enrollment, information regarding demographics, reproductive and menstrual history, tobacco exposure, alcohol
intake, medications taken, and tumor characteristics was
collected. The protocol was initially limited to Columbia
University Medical Center (CUMC) in New York City
and then was open to 4 additional sites in the Northeast.
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of CUMC and the
additional sites approved the protocol.
Fasting morning serum samples were collected at
baseline (before chemotherapy) and at 6, 12, 24, 36, and
52 weeks and stored in aliquots at 80 C until measurement. At each time point, serum MIS, FSH, and E2 levels
were measured and menstrual status was determined.

Baseline and follow-up blood draws were not timed with
menstrual cycles to coordinate study visits with routine
physician office visits and due to the irregularity of menstrual cycles, especially during the chemotherapy. It has
been established that MIS levels remain relatively constant
throughout the menstrual cycle, but FSH and E2 levels
fluctuate depending on different phases of the menstrual
cycle.
MIS was measured using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc,
Webster, Tex) with sensitivity of 0.05 ng/mL. E2 was
measured using a radioimmunoassay (Siemens Medical
Solutions Diagnostics, Los Angeles, Calif) with a sensitivity of 5 pg/mL. FSH was measured using chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays (Immulite; Siemens Medical
Solutions Diagnostics, Los Angeles, Calif) with a sensitivity of 20 pg/mL or 0.1 mIU/mL. All serum analyses were
performed in batches at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center research laboratories. Women were classified as
menstruating if they had at least 1 menstrual cycle after
chemotherapy.
Of 86 patients who completed all endpoints, 26
were aged <40 years and were included in this analysis; all
were treated with 6 months of chemotherapy. The ages
ranged from 27 to 40 years, with 24 patients between the
ages of 30 to 40 years, and the 2 youngest patients were
aged 27 years and 29 years (Table 1). In addition to chemotherapy, 14 patients were subsequently treated with
tamoxifen and 3 patients were treated with an aromatase
inhibitor (AI). No patient received gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists.
Controls were selected from women seeking infertility treatment at the Center for Women’s Reproductive
Care of Columbia University. A total of 134 women ages
30 to 40 years with only male factor infertility had MIS
levels assessed before undergoing IVF, and had proven fertility with documented pregnancies after IVF. These
women all had spontaneous regular menstrual cycles, but
may have been undergoing stress related to infertility.
Their serum samples were collected on Days 2 to 5. The
MIS levels of these healthy fertile women were compared
with those of BC patients at baseline and after
chemotherapy.
Statistical Analysis
At each time point, the medians and standard deviations
of serum MIS, FSH, and E2 were calculated for all cancer
patients and also in subgroups categorized according to
age and menstrual status. Patients were categorized as

women. CRA was defined as the absence of menses at 52
weeks. For patients with MIS values of <0.05 ng/mL, the
value was imputed to be 0.01 for the purpose of statistical
analysis.
Differences between the amenorrhea and age subgroups on all time points were tested with the nonparametric Wilcoxon 2-sample test using a 2-sided a of 0.05.
The Wilcoxon test was also used to test for differences on
change in hormone levels at different time points before,
during, and after chemotherapy.

months before pregnancy. The median MIS value was
0.94 ng/mL and values ranged from 0.2 ng/mL to 7.7 ng/
mL. Compared with these age-matched fertile women,
patients with early stage BC had similar baseline MIS levels (median, 0.86 ng/mL; range, 0.07-9.1 ng/mL [P
>.05]) (Table 2). However, 29% of cancer patients had
baseline MIS levels <0.2 ng/mL, which was the lower
limit of healthy controls; of these women, 86% were aged
>35 years of age. There was no significant difference in
MIS levels between younger women (aged 35 years) and
older women (aged >35 years) both in healthy fertile controls (median, 1.0 ng/mL vs 0.88 ng/mL; P >.05) and
breast cancer patients at baseline (median, 1.7 ng/mL vs
0.5 ng/mL; P >.05).

Effect of Chemotherapy on MIS Levels
MIS levels decreased sharply and rapidly after the initiation of chemotherapy (median, 0.08 ng/mL [range,
<0.05-0.21 ng/mL] after 6 weeks of chemotherapy and
0.05 ng/mL [range, <0.05-0.07 ng/mL] after 12 weeks of
chemotherapy, compared with 0.86 ng/mL [range, 0.079.1 ng/mL] before the initiation of chemotherapy;
P <.05, respectively). At 36 and 52 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy, MIS levels remained suppressed
(median, 0.05 ng/mL [range, <0.05-1.7 ng/mL] at 36
weeks and 0.07 ng/mL [range, <0.05-1.16 ng/mL] at 52
weeks). At 52 weeks, only 1 patient had an MIS level
above the sensitivity limit of 0.05 ng/mL (Fig. 1A)
(Table 2).

Relation Between Menstrual Status
and Hormonal Levels
At Week 52, 11 of 26 cancer patients (42%) remained
amenorrheic. In the group of patients aged <35 years,
only 25% of women remained amenorrheic. In women
aged >35 years, 50% of patients stopped menstruating.
Compared with other women, the amenorrheic group
had similar MIS levels at baseline (median, 0.98 ng/mL vs
0.97 ng/mL; P >.05) and at 52 weeks (median, 0.06 ng/

the amenorrheic and menstruating groups (median, 4.5
mIU/mL vs 6.8 mIU/mL at baseline, 11 mIU/mL vs 24
mIU/mL at Week 52; P >.05 respectively). More women
in the amenorrheic group had FSH levels within the postmenopausal range (>20 mIU/mL) at 52 weeks than

women in the menstruating group (60% in the amenorrheic group vs 23% in the menstruating group). Each
group had a similar number of patients with follicular
phase levels of E2 (>50 pg/mL) at 52 weeks (50% in the
amenorrheic group vs 57% in the menstruating group).
Despite the finding that only 1 patient had MIS
level above the lower normal range of 0.05 ng/mL at 52
weeks, 15 patients had resumed menstrual function, 11
patients had premenopausal levels of FSH (<20 mIU/
mL), and 13 patients had follicular phase levels of E2
(>50 pg/mL).
Pregnancy After Chemotherapy
One 31-year-old patient was pregnant 2 years after the
completion of chemotherapy. Before the initiation of
chemotherapy, her MIS level was 5.9 ng/mL, the FSH
level was 3.2 IU/mL, and the E2 level was 288 pg/mL. At
52 weeks, her MIS level was 0.09 ng/mL, the FSH level
was 24 IU/L, and the E2 level was 35 pg/mL, despite
resuming regular menstrual cycles.

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study indicate that both women
who regain their menses after chemotherapy and those
who do not have rapid declines in MIS to the undetectable
range as early as 6 weeks after initiating treatment. MIS
levels in all cancer patients remained low despite normalization of FSH and E2 after treatment. Baseline MIS levels in BC patients were similar to age-matched fertile
controls. Therefore, neither baseline nor change in MIS
appears to be predictive of the potential for future return
of menses in women undergoing chemotherapy.
The finding in the current study that ovarian function was intact before the initiation of therapy is consistent with prior studies in BC patients. In the study by
Lutchman Singh et al10, markers for ovarian reserve were
tested in 22 women ages 22 to 42 years with BC before
and after chemotherapy, and before and after a transient
ovarian stimulation after chemotherapy. The baseline levels and response to ovarian stimulation in BC patients
were compared with age-matched controls. They found
that ovarian function in cancer patients was not significantly different from controls. However, another study in
women with hematologic malignancies found that MIS
levels before chemotherapy were lower than in controls,
even though the control group was older.11 This may
indicate that in hematologic malignancies the ovaries may
be affected as part of the disease process or that patients

may be sicker as a result of the systemic nature of hematologic malignancies.
Chemotherapy disrupts ovarian function by depleting the primordial follicle pool in a drug- and dosedependent manner.12 Analyses of ovarian function after
cancer therapy have mostly described the prevalence of
ovarian failure after treatment, although follicular depletion may occur despite maintenance of regular menstrual
cycles.13,14 In a small study of 3 patients, Oktay et al demonstrated that with each cycle of chemotherapy the MIS
levels fall significantly, also dropping to undetectable by 6
weeks in women who have disruption of their menses.
However, they found less of a decline in the 1 woman
who maintained her periods throughout treatment.15
The results of the current study have demonstrated
that diminished ovarian reserve, or decreased MIS levels,
may be the only persistent change that can be detected after gonadotoxic damage from chemotherapy. Although
many women experienced the return of menstrual function and had normal E2 and FSH levels 6 months after
the completion of chemotherapy, their MIS levels
remained undetectable. This pattern of early MIS decline
is similar to the perimenopausal transition changes associated with natural ovarian aging. A recent study on healthy
perimenopausal women demonstrated a linear decline in
MIS profiles to values below detection at a time 5 years
before the final menstrual period (FMP),16 whereas mean
serum E2 levels were sustained until approximately 2 years
before the FMP.17 The decrease in MIS that was observed
with advancing age may be present before changes in
other ovarian aging-related markers, including AFC,
FSH, and inhibin B.16
The results of the current study indicate that baseline MIS level is not a useful predictive marker for subsequent menstrual status after chemotherapy. Amenorrheic
patients had similar baseline MIS levels compared with
menstruating patients. This result is different from 2 previous studies on women with BC. In the study by Anderson et al,18 among approximately 40 premenopausal BC
patients treated with various chemotherapy regimens, prechemotherapy MIS levels were found to be lower among
women who became amenorrheic at 6 months after chemotherapy compared with those who resumed menses (0.58
ng/mL vs 1.9 ng/mL; P ¼ .0007). Anders et al19 demonstrated that prechemotherapy median MIS levels were
lower among women with CRA compared with those
who resumed menses (0.16 ng/mL vs 1.09 ng/mL; P ¼
.02). The major difference between the current study and
these 2 previous studies is the age of the patients. In both

2103

the analysis by Anderson et al18 and Anders et al,19
women up to age 52 years were included. The women
who became amenorrheic were older (age 44.4 years 
0.9 years vs 36.7 years  1.2 years; P <.0001). All 3 studies indicate that older women have a higher risk of developing amenorrhea than a younger cohort. The younger
age of the patients in the current study may best represent
the cohort of patients who have future reproductive needs.
Although chemotherapy causes profound damage to the
ovarian reserve, as indicated by the undetectable MIS levels months after the completion of chemotherapy, pregnancy can still occur. However, the dramatic decrease in
MIS levels in patients with normal menstrual cycles and
E2 levels suggest a dissociation in hormonal parameters in
women having undergone chemotherapy; with more
subtle alterations in ovarian reserve occurring as reflected
by MIS levels.
In response to the growing recognition of issues
related to fertility and cancer treatment, the American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has published
guidelines recommending that oncologists discuss with
patients the possibility of infertility when treatment
occurs during their reproductive years.20,21 Furthermore,
ASCO guidelines recommend that oncologists be prepared to discuss possible fertility preservation options or
to refer to a reproductive specialist.20 However, there is a
lack of awareness among cancer patients and their oncologists of fertility preservation options.21 In a survey of 440
BC survivors who registered with Young Survival Coalition, 247 women (56%) recalled that they had desired a
future pregnancy at the time of diagnosis, but only 43
women (10%) took steps to preserve fertility.22
For young women looking for fertility preservation
methods before the start of chemotherapy, the most reliable method is embryo freezing, although many other
options are currently under investigation. Oocyte or ovarian tissue cryopreservation and GnRH agonist or antagonist therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy are all
active areas of research.5 BC patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for embryo or oocyte
cryopreservation should be induced by the method that
leads to the least increase in E2 levels. Oktay et al reported
using a combined letrozole-FSH protocol for ovulation
induction in these patients that produced results comparable to those of standard IVF, without a significant increase
in E2 levels.23 After following 79 patients who underwent
ovarian stimulation with this protocol for a median interval of 23.4 months, they concluded that the letrozoleFSH protocol does not increase the risk of cancer recur-

2104

rence nor compromise survival compared with BC
patients who underwent no fertility-preserving
procedure.24
It is possible that endocrine therapies administered
to some of the patients during the second 6 months of the
study could have influenced the serum hormone levels we
measured. Selective estrogen receptor modulators such as
tamoxifen have been reported to increase circulating estrogen levels and decrease FSH levels, and AIs have been
shown to profoundly decrease estrogen levels and increase
FSH levels.25 To the best of our knowledge, there have
been only limited data demonstrating the effect of these
adjuvant hormonal therapy on MIS levels, although theoretically, MIS levels should not be altered by these therapies. One study of patients receiving tamoxifen without
previous chemotherapy demonstrated stable MIS levels
throughout the 12-month follow-up period.18
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is 1
of the first prospective studies investigating the effect of
chemotherapy on ovarian reserve, specifically using MIS as
a serum marker. The BC patients were younger than in previous studies, which alleviated the concern for natural aging
as a confounding factor. We also had a large cohort of
healthy women with only male factor infertility as a control
group. All women were treated with a 6-month chemotherapy regimen that included alkylating agents, and this
ensured that any differences we observed in the current
study was not caused by the difference in duration of treatment. However, we realize that our study has some limitations, including a small sample size, only 1 year of followup, and hormonal levels that were not measured consistently in the early follicular phase of menstrual cycles. Due
to the short period of follow-up, the menstrual status was
not well established in some women. Although we classified
women as menstruating if they had at least 1 menstrual
cycle after chemotherapy, we realized that some of these
women might not have subsequent regular cycles.
Conclusions
Chemotherapy decreases ovarian reserve rapidly and dramatically. Although the secretory function of the ovary
may recover to some extent and menses may return after
the completion of chemotherapy treatment, ovarian
reserve remains persistently affected. Neither baseline nor
change in MIS predicts return of menstrual function, suggesting that ovarian reserve and endocrine function may
be affected differently or may recover differently from
chemotherapy. Even in this very young cohort, age
remains an important factor for the recovery of endocrine
