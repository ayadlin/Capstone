International network of cancer genome projects
The International Cancer Genome Consortium*

Abstract

Author Manuscript

The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) was launched to coordinate large-scale
cancer genome studies in tumors from 50 different cancer types and/or subtypes that are of clinical
and societal importance across the globe. Systematic studies of over 25,000 cancer genomes at the
genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic levels will reveal the repertoire of oncogenic mutations,
uncover traces of the mutagenic influences, define clinically-relevant subtypes for prognosis and
therapeutic management, and enable the development of new cancer therapies.
The genomes of all cancers accumulate somatic mutations1. These include nucleotide
substitutions, small insertions and deletions, chromosomal rearrangements and copy number
changes that can affect protein-coding or regulatory components of genes. In addition,
cancer genomes usually acquire somatic epigenetic “marks” compared to non-neoplastic
tissues from the same organ, notably changes in the methylation status of cytosines at CpG
dinucleotides.

A subset of the somatic mutations in cancer cells confers oncogenic properties such as
growth advantage, tissue invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, and evasion of apoptosis2.
These are termed “driver” mutations. The identification of driver mutations will provide
insights into cancer biology and highlight novel drug targets and diagnostic tests.
Knowledge of cancer mutations has already led to the development of specific therapies,
such as trastuzumab for HER2/neu positive breast cancers3 and imatinib, which targets
BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia4,5. The remaining
somatic mutations in cancer genomes that do not contribute to cancer development are
called “passengers”. These mutations provide insights into the DNA damage and repair
processes that have been operative during cancer development, including exogenous
environmental exposures6,7. In most cancer genomes, it is anticipated that passenger
mutations, as well as germline variants not yet catalogued in polymorphism databases, will
substantially outnumber drivers.
Large-scale analyses of genes in tumors have revealed that the mutation load in cancer is
abundant and heterogeneous8-13. Preliminary surveys of cancer genomes have already
demonstrated their relevance in identifying new cancer genes that constitute potential
therapeutic targets for several types of cancer, including PIK3CA14, BRAF15, NF110,

KDR10, PIK3R19, and histone methyltransferases and demethylases16,17. These projects
have also yielded correlations between cancer mutations and prognosis, such as IDH1 and
IDH2 mutations in several types of gliomas13,18. Advances in massively parallel
sequencing technology have enabled sequencing of entire cancer genomes 19-22.

Author Manuscript

Following the launch of comprehensive cancer genome projects in the United Kingdom
(Cancer Genome Project)23 and the United States (The Cancer Genome Atlas)24, cancer
genome scientists and funding agencies met in Toronto (Canada) in October 2007 to discuss
the opportunity to launch an international consortium. Key reasons for its formation were:
(1) the scope is huge; (2) independent cancer genome initiatives could lead to duplication of
effort or incomplete studies; (3) lack of standardization across studies could diminish the
opportunities to merge and compare datasets; (4) the spectrum of many cancers is known to
vary across the world; (5) an international consortium will accelerate the dissemination of
datasets and analytical methods into the user community.
Working groups were created to develop strategies and policies that would form the basis
for participation in the ICGC. The goals of the Consortium (Box 1) were released in April
2008 (http://www.icgc.org/files/ICGC_April_29_2008.pdf). Since then, working groups and
initial member projects have further refined the policies and plans for international
collaboration.

Bioethical Framework

Author Manuscript

ICGC members agreed to a core set of bioethical elements for consent as a precondition of
membership (Box 2). The Ethics and Policy Committee has created patient consent
templates for both prospective collection and retrospective use of samples and data for
ICGC projects. Differences in project-specific requirements and national legal frameworks
may require some local amendments, while still reflecting the core principles of ICGC.

Author Manuscript

The ICGC recognizes a delicate balance between protecting participants' personal data and
sharing these data to accelerate cancer research. Data access policies have been drawn up
that are respectful of the rights of the donors, while allowing ICGC data derived from
samples to be shared ethically among a wide research community. Two levels of access have
been implemented. For data that cannot be used to identify individuals, “Open access”
datasets are publically available. These include data such as gender, age range, histology,
normalized gene expression values, epigenetic datasets, somatic mutations, summaries of
germline data, and study protocols. “Controlled access” datasets contain germline genomic
data and detailed clinical information that are associated to a unique individual whose
personal identifiers have been removed. To access controlled datasets researchers must seek
authorizations by contacting the Data Access Compliance Office (DACO) (http://
www.icgc.org/daco). An independent International Data Access Committee (IDAC)
oversees the work of the DACO and provides assistance with resolving issues that arise.

Pathology and Clinical Annotation
Large-scale genomic studies of human tumors rely on the availability of fresh frozen tumor
tissue. To address the paucity of samples that meet ICGC standards, many projects have

Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 October 15.

Page 3

Author Manuscript

initiated prospective collections of high quality source material. Accordingly, the ICGC
recommended procedures to promote consistency of sample processing throughout the
Consortium and ensure a series of quality features such as high tissue integrity and tumor
cell content. Each project will need to include diverse data types such as environmental
exposures, clinical history of participants, tumor histopathology, and clinical outcomes.
Tumors display considerable clinical and biological heterogeneity which has resulted in a
variety of tumor classifications. Within the ICGC, special measures are taken to promote the
consistency of diagnosis. These include the coordination of diagnostic criteria among groups
investigating tumors that are related, and policies that all samples will be reviewed by at
least two independent reference pathologists. Furthermore, images of the stained tumor
sections (or blood smear or cytospins for hematological neoplasias), from which diagnoses
were made, will be stored and made available to the community.

Author Manuscript

Although different tumor types may require specific procedures for tumor acquisition or
compilation of clinical and environmental data, ICGC has set guidelines regarding the use of
common definitions and data standards. This will allow ICGC data users to identify
correlations between tumor-specific molecular changes with clinical and histopathological
data including prognosis, prediction of therapy response and tumor classification schemes
for diagnosis.

Study Design and Statistical Issues

Author Manuscript

To identify cancer-related genes, one needs to detect genes that are mutated at a higher
frequency than the background mutation rate. Given that several driver genes have been
found to be mutated at low frequencies, ICGC will identify somatic mutation observed in at
least 3% of tumors of a given subtype. ICGC determined that 500 samples would be needed
per tumor type (although for rare tumor types, a smaller sample size may be justified). In
practice, the degree of heterogeneity of a given tumor type is difficult to know in advance,
such that some particularly heterogeneous tumor types may require larger sample
collections.

Cancer Genome Analyses

Author Manuscript

High-quality catalogues of somatic mutations from whole cancer genomes will ultimately be
the ICGC standard. Shotgun sequencing employing second generation technologies can
detect all classes of somatic mutation implicated in cancer. Moreover, if the level of
coverage is sufficient, comprehensive high quality catalogues of somatic mutations from
individual cancer genomes can be acquired with >90% sensitivity and >95% specificity. In
order to achieve this, it will be necessary to sequence both the genome of the cancer and of a
normal tissue from the same individual to distinguish germline variants. Although a few
genomes of this standard have already been generated, the cost and the continuing
technology development will mean that interim analyses of particularly informative sectors
of the genome will be carried out, for example of all coding exons and microRNAs.
For each individual cancer genome, the catalogue of somatic mutations will be
supplemented by genome-wide information on the state of methylation of CpG

dinucleotides. The optimal strategies and technologies to achieve this are not yet clear.
Moreover, the genomes of individual cancers will be accompanied, where possible, by
analyses of the transcriptome. Although conventional array-based approaches currently
predominate, it is preferable that RNA sequencing becomes the standard as sequencing has a
greater dynamic range25 and provides additional information including novel transcripts and
sequence variants26.

ICGC Datasets

Author Manuscript

The distributed nature of the Consortium coupled with the large size of the datasets makes it
cumbersome to store all data in a single centralized repository. For this reason, the ICGC has
adopted a “franchise” database model for integrating the information and making it available
to the public. Under this model, each member project releases tumor information by copying
it into its local franchise database after it has been quality checked. Each franchise database
shares a common schema to describe the specimens, the associated clinical information, and
their genome characterization data. ICGC primary data files, including sequencing traces,
are sent to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and/or the European
Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) for archiving, while interpreted data sets, such as somatic
mutation calls, are stored in franchise databases. The ICGC franchise databases and web
portal use BioMart27, a data federation technology originally developed for use in
Ensembl28, and since adopted for use by multiple model organism and genome databases.
The management of the ICGC data flow is the responsibility of the ICGC Data Coordination
Center (DCC) located at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research.

Author Manuscript

The DCC also operates the ICGC data portal which allows researchers to access both Open
and Controlled access portions of the ICGC data. The portal provides a variety of user
interfaces that range from simple gene-oriented queries (“Show me all the non-silent coding
mutations identified in PIK3R1 for all cancers.”) to queries that integrate genomic, clinical,
and functional information (“Show me all members of the toll receptor pathway having
deletions in stage III breast cancer.”). These queries will be distributed across the franchise
databases in a manner that is invisible to the user. The portal will also provide links to the
primary files at NCBI and EBI, interfaces for generating tabular reports, data dumps in
common bioinformatics formats, and other visualizations including genome browser tracks,
pathway diagrams and survival curves. The portal is available via a link at http://
www.icgc.org.
At the time of this publication, the following cancer and reference datasets will be available
through the ICGC web portal:

Initial data releases from ICGC members for breast cancer (UK), liver cancer
(Japan), and pancreatic cancer (Australia and Canada);

Author Manuscript

The current version of the web portal provides an entry point to the open access data tier via
interactive query as well as bulk download of data files. We expect that in mid 2010 both
open access and controlled data will be available.
The ICGC recently established a bioinformatics analysis working group to compare
pipelines, analytic methods, consistency within and among algorithms, and establish
guidelines or best practices for the Consortium. Over time, significant resources will be
deployed to develop strategies to analyze the large complex datasets generated by ICGC
member projects, and provide value-added views of cancer genomic data by integrating
them with other biological and epidemiological datasets.

Data Release and IP Policies

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The data release policies of the ICGC are intended to maximize public benefit while, at the
same time, protecting the interests and rights of sample donors and their relatives. Members
of the ICGC are committed to the principles of rapid data release (with appropriate
controlled access mechanisms), in concordance with the Toronto Statement33. ICGC
members encourage the scientific community to use any data that targets specific genes and
mutations, without any restrictions. In order to allow ICGC members the opportunity to be
the first to publish global analyses from datasets they generate, the Consortium has also
agreed that member projects may specify conditions that include a time limit during which
other data users are asked to refrain from publishing global analyses (defined by several
ICGC member projects as 100 tumors and matched controls), a provision referred to as a
“publication moratorium”. In order to allow time for a dataset to be analyzed and submitted
for publication, ICGC members will have at most one year after released datasets reach the
specified threshold before third parties are permitted to submit manuscripts describing
global analyses. Further details on data release guidelines for data producers, users and
reviewers are available http://www.icgc.org. Users of ICGC data are expected to respect
these terms and to cite this manuscript and the source of pre-publication data, including the
version of the dataset. In cases of uncertainty, scientists using ICGC data are encouraged to
contact the member projects to discuss publication plans.
ICGC members believe that maximum public benefit will be achieved if the data remain
publicly accessible without patent restrictions hence no claims to possible intellectual
property (IP) derived from primary data (including somatic mutations) will be made. Users

of ICGC data (including ICGC members) may elect to perform further research and to
exercise their IP rights on these downstream discoveries. If this occurs, users are expected to
implement licensing policies that do not obstruct further research.

Initial ICGC Projects

Author Manuscript

Currently nine countries and two European consortia have initiated cancer genome projects
under the umbrella of the ICGC. The initial projects, listed in an online table that
accompanies this article, will analyze tumor types found around the globe and throughout
the human body affecting a diversity of organs including blood, brain, breast, kidney, liver,
pancreas, stomach, oral cavity, and ovary. Over time, the ICGC will investigate fifty or more
types and subtypes of cancer in adults and children. In the case of tumors with multiple
subtypes, analyses should be focused on subtypes that may be defined on pathological,
molecular, etiological or geographical differences. It is expected that some cancer types will
be studied in parallel in different parts of the world, as the mutation profiles may differ
among populations. The consortium has enabled the coordination of initial projects
analyzing similar cancers in different countries, and in some cases, the redirection of
resources to launch new projects.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)

Author Manuscript

TCGA is a comprehensive program in cancer genomics that is jointly supported and
managed by the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research
Institute of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. TCGA began in 2006 as a pilot focused on
three projects, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary,
and lung squamous carcinoma, and has recently expanded to produce comprehensive
genomic data sets for at least 10 additional cancers in the next two years. Given TCGA's
contributions in launching the ICGC and cooperation to ensure that its policies (posted at
http://cancergenome.nih.gov) are coordinated with those of the ICGC, TCGA's participation
in the ICGC is considered to be equivalent to that of a full member. TCGA, however, is not
able to join the ICGC formally at this time, because of technical and legal issues in the U.S.
related to the mechanisms of the distribution of controlled-access data, although such data
are directly available to investigators at http://cancergenome.nih.gov/dataportal. The
National Institutes of Health policies relating to distribution of controlled-access datasets are
being reviewed with the intent of enabling researchers to integrate and analyze across
databases, for example, using the franchise model adopted by the ICGC. Meanwhile, TCGA
is ensuring that projects are coordinated and data sets are compatible with those of the
Consortium.

ICGC in the Next Decade
A large proportion of common cancers affecting patients around the world have been or will
soon be selected for comprehensive cancer genome studies. Further efforts will be needed to
leverage support and expertise to tackle the remaining tumor types, including rare cancers.
The challenges of the ICGC are daunting due to the scope of the initiative, the complexity
that is inherent to the heterogeneity of cancer and the limitations of current technologies to
provide accurate long-range assemblies of highly rearranged chromosomes found in tumor

cells. These challenges underscore the importance of continued international coordination
and further engagement of the scientific community in the next decade.

Moving Towards Clinical Applications

Author Manuscript

ICGC catalogues, which are expected to grow exponentially, will have immediate relevance
in the cancer research community. Early insight into the biology of somatic mutations will
come from functional studies in cell-based and animal models of tumors. Mutation screens
in retrospective tumor banks linked to registries or clinical trials having significant clinical
data will inform on the potential clinical utility of somatic mutations as biomarkers for
prognosis or drug-response. Germline variants identified by ICGC projects may allow the
discovery of genes predisposing to familial malignancies, such as PALB2 and pancreatic
cancer12,34. High throughput screens of RNAi or small molecule libraries, and the
adaptation of existing model systems, will play a major role in refining potential therapeutic
candidates for further study35.

Author Manuscript

Translating these discoveries into clinical practice will require more sophisticated clinical
trials that take into account the increases in phenotypic subdivisions, additional coordination
to identify subjects having tumors with similar profiles, and increased use of biomarkers,
genomic analyses, informatics and other technologies in the clinical development of new
therapeutics. Given the tremendous potential for relatively low-cost genomic sequencing to
reveal clinically useful information, we anticipate that in the not so distant future, partial or
full cancer genomes will routinely be sequenced as part of the clinical evaluation of cancer
patients and as part of their on-going clinical management. The successful and appropriate
translation of cancer genome research into clinical practice will raise important social and
ethical questions. It will be essential to combine the expertise of oncologists, biostatisticians,
pathologists, geneticists, policy-makers and members of the biopharmaceutical industry to
meet this challenge by developing new policies and clinical paradigms that enable rapid
translation of many new biomarkers and cancer targets into new clinical tests and
therapeutic interventions that will benefit cancer patients.

include the full range of somatic mutations such as single-nucleotide variants,
insertions, deletions, copy number changes, translocations and other
chromosomal rearrangements, and to have the following features:
–

Comprehensiveness, such that most cancer genes with somatic
abnormalities occurring at a frequency of greater than 3% are discovered;

–

High resolution, ideally at a single nucleotide level;

–

High quality, using common standards for pathology and technology;

–

Data from matched non-tumor tissue, to distinguish somatic from
inherited sequence variants and aberrations;

–

Generate complementary catalogues of transcriptomic and epigenomic
datasets from the same tumors.

Author Manuscript

•

Make the data available to the entire research community as rapidly as possible,
and with minimal restrictions, to accelerate research into the causes and control
of cancer.

•

Coordinate research efforts so that the interests and priorities of individual
participants, self-organizing consortia, funding agencies and nations are
addressed, including use of the burden of disease and the minimization of
unnecessary redundancy in tumor analysis efforts.

•

Support the dissemination of knowledge and standards related to new
technologies, software, and methods to facilitate data integration and sharing
with cancer researchers around the globe.

Box 2
Core Bioethical Elements
For prospective research, ICGC members should convey to potential participants, that:

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

•

The ICGC is a coordinated effort among related scientific research projects
being carried on around the world

•

Participation in the ICGC and its component projects is voluntary

•

Samples and data collected will be used for cancer research, which may include
whole genome sequencing

•

The patient's care will not be affected by their decision regarding participation

•

The samples collected will be in limited quantities; access to them will be
tightly controlled and will depend on the policy and practices of the ICGCmember project. At least a small percentage of the samples may be shared with
laboratories in other countries for the purposes of performing quality control
studies

•

Data derived from the samples collected and data generated by the ICGC
members will be made accessible to ICGC members and other international
researchers through either an open or a controlled access database under terms
and conditions that will maximize participant confidentiality

•

The researchers accessing data and samples will be required to affirm that they
will not attempt to re-identify participants

•

There is a remote risk of being identified from data available on the databases

Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 October 15.

Page 9

Author Manuscript

•

Once data are placed in open databases, those data cannot be withdrawn later

•

In controlled access databases the links to (local) data that can identify an
individual will be destroyed upon withdrawal. Data previously distributed will
continue to be used

•

ICGC members agree not to make claims to possible IP on primary data

•

No profit from eventual commercial products will be returned to subjects
donating samples

For retrospective research, the above guidelines remain the same, with the exception that
where the individual is no longer a patient, there will not be a concern that their care
could be affected by participation.
For research involving samples and data from deceased individuals:

Author Manuscript

•

Where required by law or ethics, consent should always be obtained from the
families of a deceased individual if their samples and data are to be used; if reconsent is not required, however, ethics review is sufficient

•

Ethics committee review should be sought for all research proposing the use of
existing sample and data collections

•

Existing collections are a limited and valuable resource; access to them will be
tightly controlled.

For research using anonymized samples, ethics review may be required in some
jurisdictions.
