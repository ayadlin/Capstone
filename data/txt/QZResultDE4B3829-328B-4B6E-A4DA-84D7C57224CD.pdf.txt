Metastatic disease remains the primary cause of death for breast cancer patients. The
different steps of the metastatic cascade rely on reciprocal interactions between cancer cells
and their microenvironment. Within this local microenvironment and in distant organs,
immune cells and their mediators are known to facilitate metastasis formation1,2. However,
the precise contribution of tumor-induced systemic inflammation to metastasis and the
mechanisms regulating systemic inflammation are poorly understood. Here, we show that
tumors maximize their chance to metastasize by evoking a systemic inflammatory cascade
in mouse models of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis. We mechanistically demonstrate
that IL1β elicits IL17 expression from γδ T cells, resulting in systemic, G-CSF-dependent
expansion and polarization of neutrophils in mammary tumor-bearing mice. Tumor-induced
neutrophils acquired the ability to suppress cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, which limit the
establishment of metastases. Neutralization of IL17 or G-CSF and absence of γδ T cells
prevented neutrophil accumulation and down-regulated the T cell-suppressive phenotype of
neutrophils. Moreover, the absence of γδ T cells or neutrophils profoundly reduced
pulmonary and lymph node metastases without influencing primary tumor progression. Our
data indicate that targeting this novel cancer cell-initiated domino effect within the immune
system – the γδ T cell-IL17-neutrophil axis – represents a new strategy to inhibit metastatic
disease.

In breast cancer patients, increased neutrophil abundance predicts worsened metastasisspecific survival3,4. Currently, the role of neutrophils in metastasis is controversial, since
both pro- and anti-metastatic functions have been described5-7. We found a profound
systemic expansion of neutrophils in mammary tumor-bearing K14cre;Cdh1F/F;Trp53F/F
(KEP) mice8, as compared to wild-type (WT) littermates (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b).
Neutrophils, defined as CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6C+F4/80− cells, accumulated throughout
every organ examined (Extended Data Fig. 1c, d). We also investigated our recently
described KEP-based model of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis9 (Fig. 1a), where
systemic neutrophil expansion was observed as well (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1e, f).
Neutrophil expansion was tumor-induced, because surgical removal of the primary tumor
resulted in their immediate reduction (Extended Data Fig. 1g).
To determine the functional significance of neutrophils in metastasis, neutrophils were
depleted using anti-Ly6G antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). Treatment was initiated
when tumors were palpable and continued until mice developed overt metastatic disease.
Neutrophil depletion did not influence tumor growth (Extended Data Fig. 2d), tumor
histopathology (Extended Data Fig. 2e) or microvessel density (Extended Data Fig. 2e, f).
By contrast, neutrophil depletion resulted in significant reduction in both pulmonary and
lymph node metastasis (Fig. 1c). These data indicate that neutrophils assist the spread of
cancer cells to multiple locations.
Next, we evaluated the role of neutrophils in different phases of the metastatic cascade.
Neutrophils were depleted during primary tumor growth (early phase) or after removal of
the primary tumor (late phase) (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, neutrophil depletion decreased multiorgan metastasis in the early phase, but not the late phase (Fig. 1d). Metastatic nodule size
was not affected (Extended Data Fig. 2g), suggesting that neutrophils facilitate multi-organ
metastasis during the early steps of the metastatic cascade.

To understand the mechanism by which neutrophils facilitate metastasis, their phenotype
was investigated. Previous reports identified the hematopoietic stem cell marker, cKIT, on
pro-metastatic myeloid cells6,10-12, and CD11b+VEGFR1+ cells have been implicated in the
pre-metastatic niche10,13,14. A greater proportion of neutrophils from tumor-bearing KEP
mice expressed cKIT, while both neutrophils and monocytes from WT and KEP mice
expressed VEGFR1 (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). In the metastasis model, cKIT+ neutrophils
also expanded systemically, as tumors grew larger (Extended Data Fig. 3c) and reduced to
baseline levels after tumor resection (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Nuclear morphological
analysis revealed characteristics of immature cells15, including banded, circular and nonsegmented nuclei, whereas most WT neutrophils appeared hyper-segmented (Extended Data
Fig. 3e), suggesting that KEP mammary tumors promote the release of immature neutrophils
into circulation.
Next generation sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on circulating neutrophils from WT
and tumor-bearing KEP mice, revealing 100 differentially expressed genes (Extended Data
Fig. 4a and Extended Data Table 1). Several genes upregulated in neutrophils from KEP
mice, including Prok2/Bv8, S100a8 and S100a9 (Fig. 2a), have previously been linked to
metastasis6,14. Nos2, the gene encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), was the

most strongly upregulated gene by more than 150-fold (Fig. 2a). Because iNOS suppresses
T cells16-18, we hypothesized that neutrophils promote metastasis via immunosuppression.
Indeed, neutrophils from KEP mice inhibited the CD3/CD28-induced proliferation of naïve
splenic CD8+ T cells ex vivo when compared with WT neutrophils, and an iNOS inhibitor
reversed this effect (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4b). In lungs of control and neutrophildepleted tumor-bearing mice, the proportions of CD8+ T cells did not differ (Extended Data
Fig. 4c). However, the effector phenotype of CD8+ T cells was markedly enhanced upon
neutrophil depletion, as evidenced by a significantly greater proportion of CD62L−CD44+
and IFNγ+ cells (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4d, e). To further establish a mechanistic
link between neutrophils and CD8+ T cell activity, we depleted both cell populations in the
metastasis model. Combined depletion of neutrophils and CD8+ T cells reversed the
metastasis phenotype of neutrophil depletion alone (Fig. 2d), without affecting primary
tumor growth (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Depletion of CD8+ T cells alone did not alter tumor
growth or multi-organ metastasis (data not shown). These data suggest that neutrophils
facilitate cancer cell spread by suppressing CD8+ T cells. As such, neutrophils in the KEP
model can be categorized as a subpopulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs)15.

We then asked how mammary tumors induce systemic neutrophil expansion. Cytokine
profile comparison of WT mammary glands and KEP mammary tumors showed that GMCSF and G-CSF levels – two key regulators of neutrophil biology19 – were not significantly
increased in KEP tumors (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). However, expression of IL1β, IL6, and
IL12p40, a subunit of IL23, was increased (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). These cytokines are
known to stimulate IL17 from lymphocytes20-23. In inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis,
lymphocyte-derived IL17 regulates neutrophil expansion via systemic induction of GCSF21,22,24. We hypothesized that the same inflammatory cascade is important in breast
cancer metastasis. Indeed, serum levels of IL17A and G-CSF were higher in tumor-bearing
KEP mice than in WT mice (Fig. 3a). Neutralization of IL17A in tumor-bearing KEP mice
decreased G-CSF serum levels, while G-CSF blockade did not affect IL17A levels (Fig. 3a),
indicating that IL17 is upstream of G-CSF. Inhibition of either cytokine reduced circulating
neutrophils, lowered cKIT+ neutrophil proportions (Fig. 3b) and reversed neutrophil
phenotype (Fig. 3c). Injection of recombinant G-CSF to anti-IL17-treated tumor-bearing
KEP mice overcame the effects of anti-IL17 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5c-e).
Additionally, treatment of WT mice with recombinant G-CSF resulted in neutrophil
expansion, increased presence of cKIT+ neutrophil proportions, and changed neutrophil
phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 5c-e). These data demonstrate a requirement for the IL17-GCSF signaling cascade in both neutrophil expansion and phenotype.
Next, we determined the source of IL17. As T cells are known to produce IL1720,21,23,
splenic CD3+ T cells were analyzed using a T cell-specific gene expression array. This
analysis validated upregulation of IL17-related cytokines in T cells from tumor-bearing KEP
mice (Extended Data Fig. 5f). We then asked whether lymphocytes are the only source of
IL17 and whether they drive metastasis. KEP mice were crossed with Rag1−/− mice, which
lack T and B cells. Tumor initiation, proliferation and histology were the same between
KEP;Rag1+/− and KEP;Rag1−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 6a and data not shown).

However, KEP;Rag1−/− mice exhibited lower levels of IL17A and G-CSF in serum (Fig.
3d), decreased neutrophil counts (Fig. 3e) and altered neutrophil phenotype (Fig. 3f). TGFβ1
levels were unchanged between KEP;Rag1+/− and KEP;Rag1−/− mice (Extended Data Fig.
6b), suggesting that unlike other models25, TGFβ plays a lesser role in modulating
neutrophil phenotype than IL17-induced G-CSF. Importantly, KEP;Rag1−/− mice displayed
less pulmonary and lymph node metastases (Fig. 3g). The metastasis phenotype in
KEP;Rag1−/− mice was validated in the metastasis model where Rag1−/− mice were
recipients of transplanted KEP tumor fragments, resulting in reduced pulmonary metastasis
(Extended Data Fig. 6c). Thus, IL17-producing lymphocytes drive neutrophil accumulation,
phenotype and metastasis.

Direct ex vivo intracellular cytokine staining was performed to determine which T
lymphocyte subset produces IL17. Both CD4+ T cells and γδ T cells expressed IL17A (Fig.
4a), and both IL17-producing subpopulations were increased in various organs of tumorbearing KEP mice when compared to WT mice (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7a). In
primary tumors, the abundance of γδ and CD4+ T cells was too low (<0.2% and <2% of all
live cells, respectively) to reliably assess IL17 expression. γδ T cells exhibited higher IL17A
levels than CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 7b). Both cell populations were
depleted to determine their functional importance. CD4+ T cell depletion lowered cKIT+
neutrophils, but failed to significantly influence total neutrophil expansion, IL17A or G-CSF
levels (Extended Data Fig. 7c-e). Conversely, depletion of γδ T cells decreased IL17A and
G-CSF serum levels (Fig. 4c), reduced circulating neutrophils, lowered cKIT+ neutrophil
proportions (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 7c) and reversed neutrophil phenotype (Fig.
4e). These data indicate that IL17-producing γδ T cells promote neutrophil expansion and
phenotypic alterations. IL17-producing γδ T cells in tumor-bearing KEP mice were CD27−,
mostly Vγ4+, and a proportion expressed CCR6, IL1R1 and RORγt (Extended Data Fig. 8a,
b) similar to other inflammatory diseases21.
We then asked how KEP mammary tumors activate IL17-producing γδ T cells. Based on
literature20-23 and cytokine analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b), we focused on IL23 and
IL1β. IL17A expression by γδ T cells, G-CSF serum levels and neutrophil expansion was
decreased by neutralization of IL1β, but unaffected by inhibition of IL23 (Fig. 4f-h).
Macrophages were the most abundant IL1β-expressing cell type in KEP tumors (Extended
Data Fig. 8c, d). These data provide a mechanistic link between mammary tumors and γδ T
cells.
Depletion of γδ T cells in the early phase of the metastasis model did not affect tumor
histopathology, microvessel density, or primary tumor growth (Extended Data Fig. 8e and
data not shown). Importantly, however, pulmonary and lymph node metastasis were
significantly decreased in γδ T cell-depleted mice (Fig. 4i). These data were validated with
Tcrδ−/− mice, which lack γδ T cells. KEP tumor fragments were orthotopically transplanted
into Tcrδ+/− and Tcrδ−/− mice and resected following outgrowth. Genetic elimination of γδ
T cells also resulted in a significant reduction in pulmonary metastasis (Fig. 4j) without
affecting primary tumor growth (Extended Data Fig. 8f). These data confirmed a prometastatic role for γδ T cells.

In summary, we show that mammary tumor-induced, IL17-producing γδ T cells drive
systemic expansion and polarization of neutrophils towards a CD8+ T cell-suppressive
phenotype and subsequent metastasis formation in distant organs (Extended Data Fig. 9).
The importance of neutrophils during the early steps of the metastatic cascade and the
upregulation of Bv8/Prok2, S100a8 and S100a9 in neutrophils suggest that neutrophils may
help to establish the pre-metastatic niche6,10,14; although, the role of these neutrophilderived factors and others remains to be established in the KEP model. In breast cancer
patients, independent clinical studies consistently point towards a pro-metastatic role for
neutrophils, γδ T cells and IL173,4,26-29. Here, we establish a mechanistic connection
between these independent clinical observations. In infection and inflammatory disorders,
the γδ T cell-IL17-neutrophil axis drives disease pathogenesis21,23,30. We now demonstrate
that this targetable pathway also perpetuates breast cancer metastasis.

The generation and characterization of K14cre;CdhF/F;Trp53F/F (KEP) mice – a conditional
model of invasive lobular breast cancer – has been described8. KEP mice were back-crossed
onto the FVB/N background. KEP mice were crossed with Rag1−/− mice (FVB/N; a gift
from L. Coussens)32 to generate KEP;Rag1+/− and KEP;Rag1−/− mice33. The onset of
mammary tumor formation was monitored twice weekly by palpation and caliper
measurements starting at four months of age. Tcrδ−/− mice on the FVB/N background were
a gift from A. Hayday34. The spontaneous metastasis model has also been described9.
Briefly, this model is based on the orthotopic transplantation of KEP tumor pieces into
10-12 week old female recipient FVB/N mice, Rag1−/− mice, Tcrδ+/− or Tcrδ−/− mice.
These tumor pieces are allowed to grow out, then surgically removed at 100 mm2, after
which 100% of mice develop overt metastatic disease.
To deplete immune cells or neutralize cytokines, mice were injected i.p. with an initial 400
μg followed by 100 μg thrice weekly for anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8; BioXCell), 200 μg twice
weekly for anti-CD8 (clone 2.43; BioXCell), or 100 μg twice weekly for anti-γδTCR (clone
GL3; purified by the NKI protein facility). For cytokine neutralization experiments, KEP
mice were injected i.p. with 50 μg twice weekly for anti-IL17A (clone 17F3; BioXCell), 50
μg thrice weekly for anti-G-CSF (clone 67604; R&D Systems), 50 μg twice weekly antiIL23p19 (clone G23-8; eBioscience), or 50 μg twice weekly anti-IL1β (clone B122;
BioXCell). Control mice received equal amounts of isotope control antibodies or equal
volumes of PBS. Where indicated, WT and KEP mice were injected i.p. with 5 μg rG-CSF
(Peprotech) for 4 consecutive days and were sacrificed on the 5th day. Tumor-bearing KEP
mice injected with rG-CSF received anti-IL17 at the same schedule as above. Antibody
injections began when K14cre;CdhF/F;Trp53F/F mammary tumors reached 25 mm2 until
sacrifice at 225 mm2, or transplanted tumors reached 9 mm2 where indicated until surgery at
100 mm2. Three independent K14cre;CdhF/F;Trp53F/F donor tumors were tested in
neutrophil depletion experiments resulting in the same outcome. One of these donor tumors
was used throughout the remainder of the study. Blood samples were taken before and
during antibody injections for flow cytometry analyses. Animals were randomized before

beginning the treatment schedule. Mice were kept in individually ventilated and open cages
and food and water were provided ad libitum. Animal experiments were approved by the
Animal Ethics Committee of the Netherlands Cancer Institute and performed in accordance
with institutional, national and European guidelines for Animal Care and Use.

Formalin-fixed tissues were processed by routine procedures. H&E staining was performed
as described9. Citrate antigen retrieval was used for all staining procedures. Neutrophils
were detected using either anti-Ly6B (clone 7/4; Cedarlane) or anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8; BD
Biosciences), when primary tumors reached 100 mm2. Quantitative analysis of neutrophil
abundance was performed by counting cells in 5 high-power (40×) fields of view (FOV) per
tissue. Metastases were detected using anti-cytokeratin 8 (clone Troma 1; DHSB University
of Iowa). In the metastasis model, the total number of cytokeratin 8+ nodules was scored in
one lung section of each animal. The size of each nodule was measured using ImageJ, then
represented as arbitrary units. Lymph node metastases were scored as positive or negative
based on the presence of cytokeratin 8+ metastases. Mice that developed overt metastatic
disease (i.e. respiratory distress or 225 mm2 axillary lymph node metastasis) were included
in the analysis; mice that were sacrificed as a result of local recurrence were excluded.
Vimentin, E-cadherin and CD34 staining was performed as previously described9 and
scored independently by two blinded researchers. Microvessel density was scored by
averaging the total number of blood vessels from 5 fields of view for each tumor section.
For metastasis quantification in K14cre;CdhF/F;Trp53F/F;Rag1+/− and
K14cre;CdhF/F;Trp53F/F;Rag1−/− mice, single lung or lymph node sections were scored as
positive or negative based on the presence of cytokeratin 8+ metastases. Stained slides were
digitally processed using the Aperio ScanScope and captured using ImageScope software
version 11.0.2. Brightness and contrast for representative images were adjusted equally
among groups.
Flow cytometry and intracellular staining
Tissues were collected in ice-cold PBS. Blood samples were collected in tubes containing
heparin. Tumors and lungs were mechanically chopped using a McIlwain tissue chopper
(Mickle Laboratory Engineering Co.). Tumors were digested for 1 hour at 37 °C in 3 mg/mL
collagenase type A (Roche) and 25 μg/mL DNAse (Sigma) in serum-free DMEM medium.
Lungs were digested for 30 minutes at 37 °C in 100 μg/mL Liberase TM (Roche). Enzyme
activity was neutralized by addition of cold DMEM/8% FCS and suspension was dispersed
through a 70 μm cell strainer. Spleen, lymph nodes and liver were mashed through a 70 μm
cell strainer. All single cell suspensions were treated with NH4Cl erythrocyte lysis buffer.
Cells were stained with directly conjugated antibodies (listed below) for 30 minutes at 4 °C
in the dark in PBS/1% BSA. 7AAD (1:20; eBioscience) or Fixable Viability Dye eFluor®
780 (1:1000; eBioscience) was added to exclude dead cells. For intracellular staining, single
cell suspensions were stimulated in IMDM containing 8% FCS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100
μg/mL streptomycin, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 50 ng/mL PMA, 1 μM ionomycin and
(1:1000) Golgi-Plug™ (BD Biosciences) for 3 hours at 37 °C. Surface antigens were stained
first, followed by fixation and permeabilization using the Cytofix/Cytoperm™ kit (BD
Biosciences) and followed by staining of intracellular proteins. All experiments were

RNA-Seq and gene ontology analysis
Ly6G+ neutrophils were isolated by magnetic column (Miltenyi) from blood of mice. KEP
mice with mammary tumors around 225 mm2 in size and age-matched WT mice were used.
Purity of isolated neutrophils was validated by flow cytometry and only samples greater than
90% purity were used. RNA was isolated using Trizol and then treated with DNase I
(Invitrogen). Samples were put over a Qiagen RNeasy column for cleanup. RNA quality was
confirmed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer from Agilent. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using
the reagents provided in the Illumina TruSeq™ RNA Sample Preparation Kit, following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were PCR amplified for 12 cycles and sequenced on an
Illumina HiSeq 2000 System with TruSeq reagent kits and software, generating 51bp reads.
Sequence reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (NCBI build 37) using TopHat.
HTSeq-count was then used to generate a list of the total number of uniquely mapped reads
for each gene and sample. Sequence reads were normalized to 10 million reads per sample
and log2 transformed with the formula, log2(((expression gene × ÷ library size)106)+1),
where the library size was the sum of all expression values per sample. In order to determine
which genes were differentially expressed between samples, the R package Limma was
used. Absolute gene expressions were used as input and genes with no expression in any
sample were removed from the dataset. Voom was used to transform the count data to log2
counts per million and estimation of the variance. The p value was set to a cut-off of 0.05
resulting in 100 significant, differentially expressed genes. Unsupervised clustering was
performed on these 100 genes and the data were transformed into a heat-map.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Blood neutrophils from WT mice and splenic CD8+ T cells from WT mice were isolated by
magnetic column (Miltenyi). Blood neutrophils from KEP mice with mammary tumors
around 225 mm2 in size were also used. CD8+ T cells were labeled with Cell Trace CFSE
following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Equal numbers of cells (2×105) were
co-cultured in a 96-well flat bottom plate. CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were added
according to manufacturer’s instruction, and the iNOS inhibitor, L-NMMA (Sigma), was
added at 0.5 mM where indicated. After 48 hours, T cell proliferation was evaluated on a
BD LSRII flow cytometer using Diva software using the following antibodies: CD8a-PE
(1:600; clone 53-6.7), CD11b-APC (1:400; clone M1/70), Ly6C-eFluor 450 (1:400; clone
HK1.4), Ly6G-AlexaFluor 700 (1:400; clone 1A8) and 7AAD viability marker. Data
analyses were performed using FlowJo Software version 9.7.1. Proliferation index was
calculated using the formula, (% of proliferated, co-cultured CD8+ T cells) ÷ (% of
proliferated CD8+ T cells without co-culture) × 100, for each replicate experiment.
Cytokine analysis
Multiplex quantification of cytokines and chemokines in mammary glands and tumors was
performed using the premixed 24-plex Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine Assay (Bio-Rad)
according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Proteins lysates were prepared as previously
described31. Unsupervised clustering was performed on normalized, median centered data
then converted to a heat-map using Genesis software. For IL17A and G-CSF serum levels,
BD Cytometric Bead Arrays were used as directed and analyzed on a Cyan flow cytometer
with Summit software (Beckman Coulter). Data analyses were performed using FlowJo
Software version 9.7.1. For TGFβ1, a DuoSet ELISA kit was purchased from R&D Systems
and performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

PCR array
The spleens of three wild-type or K14cre;CdhF/F;Trp53F/F mammary tumor-bearing mice
were pooled and labeled with anti-CD3 antibodies. CD3+ T cells were sorted using a BD
FACSAria II. RNA was isolated with Trizol as above. Gene expression differences were
analyzed using a mouse T cell-specific PCR array from Qiagen according to their
instructions and software. Genes exhibiting a three-fold change were considered biologically
relevant.
Statistical analysis
Data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7. Applied analyses are
indicated in corresponding legends. Sample sizes were based on previous experience with
the models9,31,33. Differences with a p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Extended Data Figure 9. The γδ T cell-IL17-neutrophil axis promotes metastatic breast cancer

Mammary tumors evoke a systemic inflammatory cascade that is initiated by IL1β
production. Tumor-derived IL1β activates γδ T cells to produce IL17. Increased systemic
IL17 levels lead to upregulation of G-CSF, which subsequently causes neutrophil expansion
and alteration of neutrophil phenotype. These phenotypically altered neutrophils produce
iNOS that suppresses the activity of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells. As a result of this systemic
inflammatory cascade, the chance that disseminated cancer cells can establish metastases in
distant organs is maximized.

Figure 1. Neutrophils promote breast cancer metastasis

a, Spontaneous metastasis model. Tumor fragments from KEP mice are orthotopically
transplanted into WT recipient mice (designated by #1), allowed to proliferate (#2), then
surgically resected (#3)9. Metastases develop in 100% of recipient mice. Antibody-mediated
depletion experiments were performed in three ways: from palpable tumors to metastasisrelated sacrifice (continuous treatment), during primary tumor growth (early phase), or after
surgery until metastasis-related sacrifice (late phase). b, Neutrophil proportions in lungs at
the indicated tumor size (n = 6, 5, 6 and 8 mice for 0, 9, 25 and 100 mm2, respectively;
