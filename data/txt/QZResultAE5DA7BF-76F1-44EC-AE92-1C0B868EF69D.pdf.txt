most effective treatment for early-stage prostate cancer includes
suppression of AR function either by blocking androgen signaling
with the anti-androgens bicalutamide (Casodex) or flutamide or by
inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to the potent androgen
dihydrotestosterone with finasteride. As prostate cancer cells are
dependent on AR signaling for survival and growth, either the
removal of androgen or blocking dihydrotestosterone synthesis
leads to the induction of apoptosis in clinical prostate cancer as
well as in cell culture and animal models of prostate cancer (7, 8).
However, f30% of these patients show relapse of the disease
within 3 years as a result of the emergence of androgenindependent prostate cancer cells, which are either AR positive
or AR negative (9, 10). The molecular mechanisms dictating the
progression from androgen dependence to androgen independence
are unclear due to the lack of suitable experimental models
and molecular markers (11). In general, however, AR can be activated despite androgen blockade therapy in AR-positive prostate
cancer (12). This is attributed to an increased sensitivity of AR
to low concentrations of androgen due to mutations in AR,
AR partner-protein interactions, or post-translational modifications; these underlying factors function to promote androgen
depletion-independent signaling (13). Thus, alternative therapeutic
approaches to inhibit AR function in a ligand-independent manner
are needed to treat prostate cancer.
The proapoptotic protein prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4)
was originally identified in prostate cancer cells undergoing
apoptosis in response to ionomycin, which elevates intracellular
Ca2+ levels (14). Par-4 is up-regulated in the rat ventral prostate
after castration, and pretreatment of rats with the calcium channel blocker nifedipine prevents castration-inducible Par-4 upregulation as well as apoptosis and involution of the ventral
prostate (14). In a cell type– and inducer-specific manner, Par-4
expression is essential for apoptosis by cytokines, such as tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand,
which act via the death receptor signaling pathway, as well as by
doxorubicin, etoposide, UV irradiation, growth factor deprivation,
and ionizing radiation, which act via the intrinsic mitochondrial
pathway (15, 16). The exact point at which Par-4 converges on
these pathways is not yet delineated. Interestingly, ectopic Par-4
selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal
cells, and this cancer-selective function is mediated by its central
core domain designated as the SAC domain (17). Both protein
kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation, which results in the activation of
Par-4, and nuclear entry are essential for apoptosis by either
ectopic Par-4 or its SAC domain in cancer cells (18). Similar to the
findings with ectopic Par-4, endogenous Par-4 confers apoptosis by
a mechanism that requires PKA phosphorylation of its T155
residue as well as nuclear translocation for inhibition of NF-nB
transcription activity (18). Par-4 action may be also mediated by
interactions via its leucine zipper domain with partner proteins,

Abstract
Deletion or mutation of the androgen receptor (AR) renders
prostate tumors refractory to apoptosis by androgen ablation,
the mainstay of prostate cancer therapy. To identify novel
therapeutics that can induce apoptosis regardless of the AR
status of prostate cancer cells, we screened dietary herbal
compounds using a reporter assay for the prostate apoptosis
response-4 (Par-4) gene, which induces p53- and PTENindependent and cancer-selective apoptosis. One of the
compounds, withaferin A (WA), a major constituent of
the dietary compound Withania somnifera, induced Par-4–
dependent apoptosis in androgen-refractory prostate cancer
cells and regression of PC-3 xenografts in nude mice.
Interestingly, restoration of wild-type AR in PC-3 (AR negative)
cells abrogated both Par-4 induction and apoptosis by WA.
Individually, WA and anti-androgens induced neither Par-4
nor apoptosis in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells,
yet in combination, WA and anti-androgen synergistically
induced Par-4 and apoptosis in androgen-responsive prostate
cancer cells. Thus, when judiciously combined with antiandrogens, WA inhibits survival of both androgen-responsive
and androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells by a Par-4–
dependent mechanism. As Par-4 up-regulation induces apoptosis in most tumor cells, our findings can be extended to
high-throughput screens to identify synergistic combinations
for both therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant cancers.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in men in the United States (1). About 234,460 new cases of
prostate cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States alone,
and the numbers are projected to increase as longevity expands the
aging population (1). Both androgen and its cognate receptor
[androgen receptor (AR)] are recognized risk factors in the
development of prostate cancer (2–5). These observations are
further corroborated by genetic evidence from transgenic mouse
models, suggesting that increased AR signaling in the prostate is
linked to an increase in precancerous lesions (6). Accordingly, the

Apoptosis by Withaferin A

such as ~ protein kinase C (19) or Amida (20) in the cytoplasm and
WT1 (21), THAP (22), or ZIPK/Daax (23) in the nucleus. Endogenous Par-4, however, is phosphorylated and inactivated by AKT
and sequestered by 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm (24), thereby explaining
why cancer cells survive in the presence of endogenous Par-4.
Our laboratory is interested in identifying natural agents with
therapeutic potential against cancer and preferably minimal toxicity against normal cells. Because Par-4 induces cancer-selective
apoptosis, we screened a panel of natural dietary compounds for
Par-4 induction to identify compounds with apoptotic potential in
prostate cancer cells. Our studies identified withaferin A (WA), a
major constituent of the medicinal plant Withania somnifera, as
the only compound in this panel that induced Par-4 expression in
prostate cancer cells. The crystal structure of WA indicates that
it is a highly oxygenated C-28 ergostane-type steroid with a 22,26lactone and a 1-oxo-group (25). The ethnobotanical history of
WA-containing herbal preparations in the treatment of cancer,
inflammatory conditions (26, 27), and neurologic disorders (28),
and the growth-inhibitory properties in tumor cell culture studies
(29–31) prompted us to determine the mechanism of action of WA
in prostate cancer cells. Our results suggest that WA induces
apoptosis of prostate cancer cells and that this action is dependent
on Par-4 function in both androgen-responsive and androgenrefractory prostate cancer cells.

derivative found in the seed of Psoralea corylifolia; ref. 36) was isolated
from Rasagenthi lehyam (37) and its purity and structure was confirmed
by high-pressure liquid chromatography; and WA, genistein (isoflavone
from soy beans; ref. 38), gingerol (vanilloid from ginger; ref. 39),
plumbagin (naphthoquinone from the Plumbaginaceae and Drosereceae
group of plants; ref. 40), rutin (bioflavanoid from the buckwheat plant
Fagopyrum esculentum; ref. 41), and diosgenin (steroidal saponin from
fenugreek; ref. 42) were from Chromadex (Santa Ana, CA). Caspase-3
inhibitor zDEVD-FMK was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).
Androgen antagonist and hydroxyl flutamide were purchased from Sigma
Chemical. Based on initial optimization studies, we used 4 Amol/L
amounts of WA, 1 Amol/L flutamide, or 2 Amol/L WA in combination
with 1 Amol/L flutamide or 2 Amol/L Casodex.
Cell viability and apoptotic assays. Cells were treated with WA or
vehicle (DMSO) for 12 or 24 h, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) or apoptotic assays [Annexin V-FITC
or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL)] were done as described previously (32, 37, 43).
Western blot analysis. Cells were treated with WA (at the IC50
concentration for each cell line based on initial optimization studies) for
various time intervals, and cell lysates were subjected to Western blot
analysis using antibodies for Par-4, Bcl-2, and AR from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); cleaved (active) caspase-8 and cleaved
(active) caspase-3 from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); or h-actin from Sigma
Chemical as a loading control.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from cells
after the indicated treatments using Trizol (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO).
The RNA (1 Ag) was subjected to reverse transcription using the avian
myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase kit from Roche (Indianapolis, IN).
Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized by PCR using the forward primer
(5¶-GGCACACCTGGGAGCCGGATCC-3¶) and the reverse primer (5¶-CGCAGCTTCCTCTTCTCGATCT-3¶) for Par-4 and the GC-RICH PCR kit from
Roche to amplify the products. PCR amplification of glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was similarly done as a control
using 5¶-AAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3¶ and 5¶-CAGGGATGATGTTCTGGAGAGC-3¶ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The
optimized thermal cycling conditions were 95jC for 5 min followed by
28 cycles of amplification at 55jC, 68jC, and 95jC, each for 1 min.
PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, stained
with ethidium bromide, and documented by photography. Nucleotide
sequencing of the PCR products was done at the University of California
(Davis, CA).
Transient transfection and luciferase assays. Prostate cancer cells (at
80-90% confluency) were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus
reagents (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with 4 Ag of either the Par-4
promoter-luciferase construct or the NF-nB-luciferase construct (containing
two tandem NF-nB-responsive sites) in the presence of h-galactosidase
control or vector containing Renilla luciferase to normalize for transfection
efficiency as described previously (17). Transfected cells were treated with
WA or vehicle (DMSO) as indicated, and the cells were harvested after
24 h for luciferase or h-galactosidase activity assays.
Xenograft studies. We tested the effect of WA on tumors derived from
PC-3 cells in 5 to 6 week male nude (nu/nu) mice ( from Charles River
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), in accordance with the University of
Kentucky Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. About 5  106 cells
were injected s.c. into 20 animals, and tumors were allowed to grow until
they reached a volume of 50 mm3. At this time, the animals were
randomized into two groups, with 10 mice in each group, and WA (5 mg/kg
body weight, dissolved in DMSO and diluted by PBS) or same amount of
DMSO was dissolved in PBS given intratumorally 5 days a week for up to 4
weeks. WA dose was determined based on our initial optimization of
experiments in mice. Tumor volume was measured daily over the
observation period.
Immunocytochemical analysis. PC-3 cells, grown in chamber slides,
were treated with WA and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence for
active forms of caspase-8 and caspase-3 or for Par-4 using primary
antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A secondary antibody

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, plasmid constructs, and small interfering RNA duplexes.
PC-3, LNCaP, and PzHPV-7 cells were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The highly aggressive LNCaP-derivative
LN3 cells were from Curtis Pettaway (The University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center, Dallas, Houston, TX). CWR22RV-1 cells were
kindly provided by Dr. Michael Sramkoski (Case Western Reserve University,
Cleveland, OH). PC-3 and CWR22Rv-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); LNCaP and LN-3 cells
were grown in DMEM supplemented with glutamine in 10% FBS and
antibiotics; and PzHPV-7 cells were grown in keratinocyte serum-free
medium from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). In experiments that
examined the role of dihydrotestosterone and AR in WA action, the
androgen-responsive cells were grown in 10% charcoal stripped–serum
containing medium lacking phenol red in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (Sigma Chemical). The small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide
duplexes for human Par-4, mouse Par-4, AR, or scrambled control were
from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette,CO). Human and mouse Par-4 show >85%
similarity at the amino acid level. Importantly, all critical domains,
especially those involved in the induction of apoptosis, are conserved in
human and mouse Par-4. The human Par-4 siRNA sequence targets
human Par-4 RNA at an area that shows maximal divergence from mouse
Par-4; accordingly, only 11 of 19 nucleotides are similar in human and
mouse Par-4 siRNA. The human Par-4 siRNA inhibits human Par-4,
whereas the mouse Par-4 siRNA does not inhibit human Par-4, as
confirmed by previous studies (24). Therefore, mouse Par-4 siRNA was
used as a control in the studies done in PC-3 and CWR22Rv1 cells. The
wild-type (WT) AR expression construct was from Gerhard Coetzee
(University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). The Par-4 promoterluciferase construct contained f2 kb of human Par-4 promoter region
upstream of the first ATG codon (Genbank accession no. AF541923) to
drive luciferase expression in pGL3 (vector from Pierce Biotechnology,
Rockford, IL).
Natural dietary compounds, caspase inhibitors, or AR inhibitors.

epigallocatechin-3-gallate (polyphenol from green tea; ref. 33), lycopene

grape skin; ref. 35), were from Sigma Chemical; psoralidin (coumestan

conjugated with the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488 (green) or Alexa Fluor
594 (red) from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) was used to detect the
primary antibody. Immunocytochemical with normal rabbit antibody was
used as a control. For protein localization, nuclei were stained with
propidium iodide or 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI)
for 20 min after cell fixation.
Fluorometry for caspase-3 activation. Caspase activation was
analyzed using the ApoAlert caspase-3 fluorescent assay kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Cell lysates
were treated with caspase-3 inhibitor and reaction buffer, and after
incubation for 30 min on ice, caspase-3 substrate (DEVD-AFC) was added
and incubated for 1 h at 37jC. The samples were transferred to
96-well plates and read in a fluorometer with an excitation wavelength of
400 nm and emission wavelength of 505 nm. Nonconjugated AFC supplied
with the kit was used to construct the calibration curve, and the caspase-3
activity was read against the calibration curve.
Statistical analysis. All experiments were done at least thrice to
ascertain the reproducibility of the results. The data shown are
representative of three experiments. The apoptosis data shown are a mean
of four readings from each of the three experiments (total of 12 readings)
FSD error bars. The Student’s t test was used to calculate statistical
significance.

induces p53- and PTEN-independent apoptosis of cancer cells
and tumor regression (44, 45), we developed a cell-based assay
using Par-4 expression as a molecular indicator to screen for
natural dietary compounds with apoptotic potential. The ARnegative (androgen refractory) prostate cancer cells, PC-3, which
lack p53 and PTEN function and are sensitive to apoptosis by
Par-4 (17), were transfected with either the Par-4 promoterluciferase reporter construct or the control pGL3-luciferase
construct lacking the Par-4 promoter to test a panel of natural
dietary compounds for induction of Par-4. The transfectants were
treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or various natural dietary
compounds for 6 h, and induction of the Par-4 promoter was
analyzed by luciferase assays. As seen in Fig. 1A, luciferase
activity was induced by the Par-4 promoter in response to WA,
not plumbagin (5 Amol/L), diosgenin (10 nmol/L), genistein
(30 Amol/L), rutin (60 Amol/L), psoralidin (15 Amol/L), gingerol
(40 Amol/L), curcumin (4 Amol/L), resveratrol (1 Amol/L), lycopene (1 Amol/L), or epigallocatechin-3-gallate (30 Amol/L). In
contrast, WA did not induce luciferase activity in cells transfected
with the pGL3 control vector (data not shown). To verify induction
of endogenous Par-4 by WA, parental PC-3 cells were treated with
the various compounds for 12 or 24 h, and whole-cell lysates were
examined for Par-4 expression by Western blot analysis. As seen
in Fig. 1B, Par-4 expression was induced by WA, but not by the
other compounds. Thus, the Par-4 reporter assay was effective in
identifying WA as a prospective natural product that may regulate
apoptosis via Par-4.

Results

whether inhibition of cell viability by WA was a consequence of
apoptosis, we treated PC-3, CWR22Rv-1, and PzHPV-7 cells with
WA for 24 h and measured apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 2B, WA
induced significant dose-dependent apoptosis in PC-3 cells
relative to CWR22Rv-1 cells and PzHPV-7 cells. Moreover, WA
induced time-dependent apoptosis over a 24-h period in PC-3
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2) and also translocated Par-4 to the
nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S3). Together, these findings suggest
that WA causes apoptosis in androgen-refractory prostate cancer
cells.
To ascertain the effect of WA on prostate tumor growth, we
tested the effect of WA on PC-3 xenografts in nude mice. The
animals were injected intratumorally with WA or vehicle and
tumor volumes were measured up to 4 weeks after the injections.
As seen in Fig. 2C, tumors injected with vehicle continued to grow,
whereas tumors injected with WA showed significant (P < 0.001)
growth inhibition. Importantly, the WA-treated tumors failed to
regrow during the 8-week observation period. When sections of the
tumors were tested for Par-4 expression and apoptosis, a
significant number of cells in the WA-treated tumors showed
Par-4 up-regulation (Supplementary Fig. S4) and apoptosis (Fig. 2C,
inset) relative to vehicle-treated tumors. Thus, WA caused
induction of Par-4 expression, apoptosis, and regression of
experimental tumors.
Role of Par-4 in the apoptotic action of WA. To determine
whether Par-4 induction was causally involved in the apoptotic
action of WA, we knocked down Par-4 expression in PC-3 cells
by using human Par-4 siRNA and then treated the cells with
vehicle or WA for 24 h. Cells transfected with mouse Par-4
siRNA or vector alone were used as control. The effect of Par-4

To study the kinetics of Par-4 induction by WA, PC-3 cells
were treated with WA (4 Amol/L) for various time intervals and
Par-4 expression was examined by Western blot analysis. As seen
in Fig. 1C, WA up-regulated Par-4 within 3 h of treatment and
maximal up-regulation was seen at 24 h. Next, to ascertain that
Par-4 is up-regulated by WA at the RNA and promoter level,
PC-3 cells were treated with WA (4 Amol/L), and RNA from the
cells was examined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).
Alternatively, cells were transiently transfected with either the
Par-4 promoter-luciferase reporter or control pGL3-luciferase
construct and treated with WA (4 Amol/L), and lysates were
harvested for luciferase assays. RT-PCR analysis indicates that
WA caused up-regulation of Par-4 RNA relative to the GAPDH
control in PC-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Consistently,
robust induction of Par-4 promoter activity by WA relative to
vehicle-treated cells was noted (Fig. 1D). Together, these findings
indicate that WA consistently up-regulates Par-4 expression in
PC-3 cells.
WA induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. To determine
whether WA inhibited prostate cancer cell survival, we did cell
viability assays. Prostate cancer cells PC-3 and DU145 (both of
which lack AR), PC-3 transfectants stably expressing ectopic
WT AR (PC-3/AR), prostate cancer cells LNCaP and CWR22Rv-1
(both of which express AR mutant), and normal/immortalized
prostate cancer cells PzHPV-7 were treated with various concentrations of WA for 24 h, and cell viability was quantified. WA
caused significant inhibition of cell viability in the androgenrefractory PC-3 and DU145 cells relative to the AR-transfected PC3/AR cells, LNCaP or CWR22Rv-1 (androgen responsive) prostate
cancer cells, and immortalized PzHPV-7 cells (Fig. 2A). To resolve

role of Par-4 in caspase activation, we knocked down endogenous
Par-4 in PC-3 cells using either human Par-4 siRNA or mouse Par-4
siRNA for control, treated the cells with WA, and did immunocytochemical for activated caspase-8 or caspase-3. As seen in Fig. 3B,
siRNA for human Par-4, but not mouse Par-4, prevented the
activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 by WA. These results indicate
that Par-4 induction is necessary for caspase-8 and caspase-3
activation by WA in PC-3 cells.
Because Par-4-inducible apoptosis involves inhibition of both
NF-nB transcription activity (44) and downstream targets of
NF-nB, including Bcl-2 (46), we examined whether WA regulated NF-nB activation and Bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, WA
inhibited NF-nB-dependent luciferase activity (Supplementary
Fig. S7) and caused down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression (Supplementary Fig. S8) in PC-3 cells. To determine whether Par-4 function
was essential for inhibition of NF-nB signaling, we knocked down
Par-4 expression in PC-3 cells by using Par-4 siRNA, transfected the
cells with the NF-nB-luciferase construct, treated the cells with WA,
and did luciferase assays for NF-nB activity and Western blot
analysis for Bcl-2 expression. WA failed to inhibit NF-nB activity
(Fig. 3C) and Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 3D) in cells where Par-4
expression was knocked down with human Par-4 siRNA but not
when Par-4 levels were unaffected with mouse or control Par-4
siRNA. These findings imply that Par-4 function is necessary for

siRNA was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D, bottom)
and, after treatment with WA, Par-4 levels were inhibited in
human Par-4 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2D). Importantly, we noted
that WA-inducible apoptosis was inhibited in cells transfected
with human Par-4 siRNA but not in cells transfected with
control mouse Par-4 siRNA (Fig. 2D, top). Moreover, transfection
with dominant-negative Par-4 abrogated WA-inducible apoptosis
in PC-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results indicate that
Par-4 is essential for WA-inducible apoptosis.
WA induces caspase signaling and inhibits NF-KB activity by
a Par-4–dependent pathway. In studies aimed at identifying the
downstream signaling pathways involved in WA-inducible apoptosis of PC-3 cells, we noted that WA caused the activation of
caspase-3, as judged by immunocytochemical fluorometry assays
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Moreover, inhibition of caspase-3 activity
by zDEVD-FMK led to inhibition of WA-inducible apoptosis
(Fig. 3A), implying that caspase-3 activation was essential for
WA-inducible apoptosis. Interestingly, Western blot analysis for
Par-4 in cells treated with WA and the caspase-3 inhibitor indicated
that WA induces Par-4 expression despite inhibition of caspase-3,
implying that Par-4 induction occurs upstream of caspase-3
activation in the apoptotic pathway induced by WA. Further
immunocytochemical studies indicated that WA induces the
activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 (Fig. 3B). To determine the

Figure 4. AR inhibits Par-4–dependent
apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. A, PC-3
cells were transfected with either control
vector or WT AR expression construct and
then treated with WA (8Amol/L) or vehicle
for 24 h. Whole-cell extracts were
examined by Western blot analysis for AR
and actin (bottom ), or the cells were
subjected to apoptosis assays (top).
B, CWR22Rv-1 cells were treated with

cells were subjected to apoptosis assays
after 12 h (top ). C, CWR22Rv-1 cells were
transfected with siRNA for AR or
scrambled siRNA duplexes for control, and
the cells were then treated with WA or

examined by Western blot analysis for AR,

expression (Fig. 4B); however, the combination of anti-androgen
and WA down-regulated AR and up-regulated Par-4 expression in
the AR-mutant cells.
We also knocked down AR expression in CWR22Rv-1 cells with
AR siRNA to directly validate the role of AR in Par-4 induction and
sensitivity to WA-mediated apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 4C, WA upregulated Par-4 expression and induced apoptosis in CWR22Rv-1
cells transfected with AR siRNA but not in cells transfected with
control siRNA. It is important to note that WA induces AR
expression in CWR22Rv-1 cells, which in turn down-regulates
Par-4 expression. This may be the reason for the resistance of the
CWR22Rv-1 cells to WA. These results indicate that AR signaling
prevents Par-4 induction and apoptosis by WA; therefore,
inhibition of AR signaling restores Par-4 induction and sensitivity
to WA.
Finally, we sought to determine whether Par-4 function was
essential for induction of apoptosis by the combination of WA and
flutamide in androgen-responsive cells. CWR22Rv-1 cells were
transfected with either human Par-4 siRNA or mouse Par-4 siRNA
and then treated with either the combination of flutamide and WA
or vehicle. Inhibition of endogenous Par-4 with human Par-4
siRNA, but not with mouse siRNA, was confirmed by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 4D). When the cells were scored for apoptosis, we
noted that the combination of flutamide and WA induced
apoptosis in cells transfected with mouse Par-4 siRNA but not in

WA to down-regulate prosurvival NF-nB activity and Bcl-2
expression in PC-3 cells.
AR prevents Par-4 induction and apoptosis by WA. As WA
induced apoptosis in androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells, but
not in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells, we sought to
directly address whether AR modulates sensitivity to WA. PC-3 cells
were transfected with an expression construct for either WT AR or
control vector, and AR expression was verified by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 4A). The transfectants were then treated with WA and
scored for apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 4A, WA-inducible Par-4
expression and apoptosis were significantly inhibited (P < 0.001) in
transfectants expressing WT AR relative to those expressing the
control vector, suggesting that AR may confer resistance to
apoptosis by WA.
Next, we determined the role of AR in resistance to WAmediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells that express endogenous AR (i.e., androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells CWR22Rv-1,
LNCaP, and LN-3). First, we asked whether inhibition of AR
signaling with anti-androgen could render CWR22Rv-1 cells
susceptible to WA-inducible apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 4B, neither
anti-androgen ( flutamide) nor WA caused apoptosis in the
androgen refractory prostate cancer cells. However, the combination of anti-androgen and WA caused significant induction of
apoptosis in the cells (Fig. 4B). Moreover, Western blot analysis
indicated that neither WA nor anti-androgen induced Par-4

WA failed to induce apoptosis in immortalized prostate epithelial
cells, except at very high toxic doses. However, further studies using
a broad panel of cell lines and in vivo models are essential to
determine whether WA shows differential effects in normal and
cancer cells.
Although several previous reports have described the growthinhibitory potential of WA, the present study shows for the first
time that WA inhibits cell viability by inducing apoptosis.
Moreover, the mechanism of apoptosis involves induction of Par-4,
activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, and inhibition of the
prosurvival activity of NF-nB. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Par-4
results in abrogation of WA-inducible caspase activation and
inhibition of NF-nB activity, thereby positioning Par-4 induction by
WA as an essential event upstream of caspase activation and NF-nB
inhibition. Thus, WA, acting via induction of endogenous Par-4,
activates a caspase-8- and caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway
in prostate cancer cells.
AR function is integrally linked to prostate cancer progression.
Initially, androgen independence was believed to be a consequence of AR loss, but it is now apparent that AR is expressed
in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. There is a growing
consensus, therefore, that the lack of responsiveness to antiandrogen therapy is a function of either enhanced sensitivity of
AR to androgen levels (owing to mutations) or post-translational
alterations in AR (13). Accordingly, both androgen-responsive or
androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells have been identified in
clinical specimens as well as in cell lines derived and established
from advanced prostate cancer, as exemplified by the ARnegative PC-3 and DU145 cells and the LNCaP and CWR22Rv-1
(AR mutant) cells. Our findings suggest that, similar to ARnegative cells, AR-mutant cells, in which AR expression is
knocked down by RNAi or AR signaling is ablated by antiandrogens, allow WA to induce Par-4. By contrast, AR-mutant
cells with functionally active AR signaling do not allow WA to
induce apoptosis. These findings on the suppression of Par-4
expression by AR signaling are consistent with our previous
observation that castration, which depletes androgen and AR
signaling, causes induction of Par-4 in the rat ventral prostate
and that implantation of testosterone pellets prevents Par-4
induction following castration (47). Thus, AR signaling inhibits
Par-4 induction by WA. Further studies should uncover the
proximal events responsible for induction of the Par-4 promoter
by WA and its suppression by AR signaling.
Most prostate tumors initially respond to androgen ablation
therapy but later convert to androgen depletion-independent
growth. At this advanced stage, AR inhibitors fail to function
effectively, leaving little to no recourse for the patient. Because AR
impedes the action of WA, but a combination of anti-androgens
and WA induces apoptosis in androgen-independent prostate
cancer cells, our studies underscore the significance of screening
new compounds to identify synergistic combinations for prostate
cancer therapy.

cells transfected with human Par-4 siRNA (Fig. 4D; Supplementary
Fig. S9). Together, these findings suggest that inhibition of AR
signaling facilitates Par-4–dependent apoptosis of androgenresponsive prostate cancer cells.

Discussion
Our findings suggest that WA preferentially induces apoptosis in
androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells but not in androgenresponsive (WT AR or AR mutant) prostate cancer cells and normal/immortalized prostate epithelial cells. Interestingly, treatment
of androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells with anti-androgens
( flutamide and Casodex; data not shown), which on their own do
not cause apoptosis, rendered the cells amenable to apoptosis by
WA. Apoptosis by WA required the up-regulation of Par-4
expression for inhibition of NF-nB activity and for activation of
the caspase cascade. Thus, this study identified, for the first time,
the mechanism of apoptosis by WA. Moreover, our findings
indicate that despite AR-mutation, prostate cancer cells are
responsive to AR signaling, which sustains cell survival even in
the presence of anti-androgens, and that a combination of WA and
anti-androgens can synergistically induce Par-4 expression and
apoptosis. Because androgen depletion independence is a critical
determinant of aggressive prostate cancer that is refractory to
conventional treatment, our findings provide new insight for the
treatment of such tumors using a combinatorial approach with
natural compounds, such as WA, which may work synergistically
with anti-androgens to inhibit cell survival.
As Par-4 is induced exclusively by apoptotic agents (14), we used
the Par-4 promoter construct to screen a panel of natural products
for apoptotic activity in cancer cells. Moreover, mutations in the
Par-4 gene have not been reported in cancer cells, but the protein
is rendered inactive by binding and phosphorylation by Akt activity,
which is elevated in cancer cells (24). Par-4 function is essential for
the induction of apoptosis by a broad range of agents, implying
that endogenous Par-4 must be activated in response to these
apoptotic agents (16). Two potential modes of Par-4 activation are
the following: (a) up-regulation of Par-4 above the necessary
thresholds to override inhibition by Akt, translocate Par-4 to the
nucleus, and induce apoptosis (45) and (b) inhibition of Akt to
release Par-4 for apoptosis (24). Our studies indicate that, from the
compounds tested in this screen, only WA was able to induce Par-4
expression. Several other compounds from this panel have been
reported in the literature to cause either growth-inhibitory or
apoptotic effects in cancer cells, yet these compounds did not
induce Par-4 expression. Apparently, these compounds induce
apoptosis either by inhibiting Akt activity to release active Par-4 for
apoptosis or by triggering a Par-4–independent mechanism. Our
ongoing studies are poised to address the mechanism of prostate
cancer cell apoptosis by the natural compounds that did not
induce Par-4 expression. As Par-4 can induce apoptosis in the
absence of p53 or PTEN function, both of which are often lost in
cancer, our findings using the Par-4 reporter can be extended to
high-throughput screens of natural compounds and small molecules for their anticancer/apoptotic potential. Most importantly,
because ectopic Par-4 expression induces apoptosis exclusively in
cancer cells and not in normal cells, the ideal compounds
identified in the Par-4 reporter assays would preferentially induce
Par-4–dependent apoptosis without activating other apoptotic
pathways that would compromise cancer cell selectivity and
consequently induce toxicity in normal cells. In the present study,
