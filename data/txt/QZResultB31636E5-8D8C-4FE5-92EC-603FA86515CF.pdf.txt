Abstract
Canonical Wnt signaling is deregulated in several types of human cancer where it plays a central role in tumor
cell growth and progression. Here we report the identification of 2 new small molecules that specifically inhibit
canonical Wnt pathway at the level of the destruction complex. Specificity was verified in various cellular
reporter systems, a Xenopus double-axis formation assay and a gene expression profile analysis. In human
colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, the new compounds JW67 and JW74 rapidly reduced active b-catenin with a
subsequent downregulation of Wnt target genes, including AXIN2, SP5, and NKD1. Notably, AXIN2 protein levels
were strongly increased after compound exposure. Long-term treatment with JW74 inhibited the growth of
tumor cells in both a mouse xenograft model of CRC and in ApcMin mice (multiple intestinal neoplasia, Min). Our
findings rationalize further preclinical and clinical evaluation of these new compounds as novel modalities for
cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 71(1); 197–205. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
b-Catenin is a key component of the Wnt pathway that
upon Wnt activation translocates to the nucleus where it activates gene transcription in association with TCF/LEF transcription factors. In the inactive state of Wnt signaling, b-catenin is
located in the cytoplasm in a large protein complex with AXIN,
APC, GSK-3b, and others that facilitates b-catenin phosphorylation and its subsequent degradation in the proteasome.
Canonical Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in embryonic
development, and in a deregulated stage, Wnt signaling is a
common denominator in a variety of tumors (1–3). Wntactivating mutations are present in a variety of cancers
including colon cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, Wilms tumor of the kidney, medulloblastoma, melanoma, non–small cell lung cancer, ovarian endometriod
cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer, pancreas adenocarcinoma,

and prostate cancer (1). About 90% of sporadic colon cancers
show aberrant Wnt signaling (2, 4, 5), whereas all pancreatic
adenocarcinomas exhibit alterations in Wnt/Notch signaling
(6). Frequently, mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC), b-catenin, or AXIN genes lead to the accumulation of
nuclear b-catenin and contribute to tumor initiation and
progression (5). Furthermore, alterations in extracellular proteins that silence Wnt signaling, including secreted frizzled
related proteins (7), Dickkopf (DKK; ref. 8), and members of
the Wnt inhibitor factor (WIF) family (9), may lead to an
abnormal pathway activity (10).
Blocking canonical Wnt activity in colorectal and other Wntderegulated cancers has been shown to cause cell-cycle arrest
in the G1 phase, which is likely a crucial step in tumor cell
growth inhibition (11, 12). Because elevated levels of b-catenin
in the nucleus seem to be a common feature of abnormal
canonical Wnt signaling (1), downregulation of canonical Wnt
activity by reducing the presence of nuclear b-catenin represents a promising therapeutic strategy. In recent years, several
classes of small molecules have been shown to act as Wnt
inhibitors that exert their inhibitory effects at various levels of
the Wnt signaling pathway (13–21). Recently, 2 groups of
chemical substances, IWR-1 and XAV939, were identified that
stabilize the destruction complex (22, 23). Mathematical modeling prediction of destruction complex activity showed that
AXIN2 functions as a critical rate limiting factor (24). By
blocking the PARP domain of Tankyrase, XAV939 and IWR1 are thought to alter the poly-ADP ribosylation (PARsylation)
and ubiquitination of AXIN2 that results both in its increased
stability and in inhibition of the canonical Wnt signaling.
In this study, we present 2 novel small molecules that
strongly and specifically reduce levels of active b-catenin
in vitro and in vivo. Their specificity and tumor growth

Results
High-throughput screen for inhibitors of the canonical
Wnt signaling
To screen for small molecule inhibitors of canonical
Wnt signaling, a synthetic TCF-responsive promoter
[SuperTOPFlash (ST-Luc); 7 TCF-binding sites; refs. 25,
26] was coupled to a destabilized d1EGFP gene (Fig. 1A).
The construct was stably transfected into HEK293 cells. These
cells were activated using conditioned media from L Wnt3aexpressing cells (27) and sorted by FACS to create the stable
reporter cell line ST-d1EGFP HEK293. In the reporter line, the
expression of d1EGFP peaked at 24 hours (35% d1EGFPpositive cells), and detectable reporter expression disappeared
within 24 hours after the removal of Wnt-containing medium
(Fig. 1B, top). The ST-d1EGFP HEK293 cell line was used for
screening 37,000 compounds, selected on the basis of structural diversity, stability, and molecular mass. A hit cutoff was
set to below IC90 (dotted line in Fig. 1B, bottom). The initial
screen yielded 77 primary hits.
JW67 and JW74 are efficient and specific inhibitors of
the canonical Wnt signaling in vitro and in vivo
In the following rescreening tests of the 77 primary hits, we
used luciferase reporter assays, including Renilla expression as
an internal reference, for 3 cell signaling pathways to examine
the compound specificity: (i) HEK293 cells that were transiently transfected with Wnt signal inducible ST-Luc, (ii) Shh
Light II cells (Gli1-Luc) were used as a stable reporter line for
the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway; and (iii) HEK293
cells with transiently transfected NF-kB luciferase reporter
(NF-kB-Luc) were used to test the NF-kB pathway. The reporter cells were induced with 30% Wnt3a conditioned media
(Wnt3a-CM), 50% Shh-CM (Gli-Luc), or 10 ng/mL of TNFa (NFkB-Luc), respectively, and incubated in the presence of various
compound concentrations. A low effect in ST-Luc or unspecific
repression of the Shh- or NF-kB pathways excluded most of the
primary hits and yielded 2 lead compounds named JW67 and

JW74 (Fig. 1D). Compounds JW67 and JW74 showed a reduction of canonical Wnt signaling in the ST-Luc assay with IC50
values of 1.17 mmol/L and 790 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S1A). JW67 or JW74, at concentrations 1 to
10 mmol/L, showed no significant inhibitory effects in the
assays when measuring Shh-Luc (Fig. 2B and Supplementary
Fig. S2A), NF-kB activity (Fig. 2C), or Renilla readout.
To examine the in vivo efficacy and specificity of the compounds JW67 and JW74 in obstructing canonical Wnt signaling,
a Xenopus laevis axis duplication assay was carried out. Injection of ectopic X. laevis Wnt8 (XWnt8) mRNA into the ventral
blastomeres of 4-cell stage embryos activates the canonical
Wnt pathway and induces a secondary body axis. This assay
thus provides a reliable method to test biological effects of
compounds with potential effects on Wnt signaling. A coinjection of 10 pg of XWnt8 with 0.4 pmol of JW67 resulted in a
57% reduction of double-axis formation compared with DMSO
controls (n ¼ 123), whereas JW74 showed a reduction of 87%
at 0.4 pmol (n ¼ 535; Fig. 2D, top and bottom). In summary,

JW67 and JW74 increase concentration of AXIN2 and
decrease the active form of b-catenin in SW480
colorectal cancer cells
Next, we questioned which level of activation of canonical
Wnt signaling was specifically targeted by the 2 compounds.
Downstream of the receptor level, the activity of GSK-3b can
be inhibited by LiCl, resulting in inefficient phosphorylation of
b-catenin and its subsequent degradation that ultimately
leads to the activation of Wnt target genes (28, 29).
HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with ST-Luc,
induced with 25 mmol/L of LiCl and exposed to various doses
of the compounds. Both compounds, JW67 and JW74, antagonized LiCl-induced activation of the canonical Wnt signaling
with IC50 values of 690 and 420 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 3A
and Supplementary Fig. S1B). These results indicated that the
2 compounds exerted their effects at the level of the b-catenin
destruction complex (GSK-3b/AXIN/APC) or downstream of
it. Downstream of the destruction complex, Wnt signaling can
be readily activated by the overexpression of normal fulllength b-catenin or by b-catenin carrying stabilizing alanine
point mutations at the N-terminal phosphorylation sites (S33,
S37, T41, S45; dominant, active b-catenin, da-Cat). HEK293
cells were transiently transfected with ST-Luc/Renilla and
with plasmids encoding full-length b-catenin or da-Cat. Plasmid amounts used for transfections were diminished to
nanograms per well in a 48-well plate to obtain reporter
induction in the range of 10 to 20 fold. The activity of STLuc after overexpression of normal full-length b-catenin was
significantly reduced by both compounds at 10 mmol/L (Shapiro–Wilk test failed, Mann–Whitney rank-sum test: JW67,
P ¼ 0.001; JW74, P ¼ < 0.001; Fig. 3B, left, and Supplementary
Fig. S2A). However, Wnt activation induced by da-Cat was
not significantly antagonized by the compounds (Fig. 3B, right;
Shapiro–Wilk tests failed, Mann–Whitney: JW67, P ¼ 0.126;
JW74, P ¼ 0.928; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Thus, both compounds may affect the steady-state level of b-catenin through
N-terminal phosphorylation, most likely through activity by
the GSK-3b/AXIN/APC destruction complex.
Next, we tested JW67 and JW74 in the colorectal cancer
(CRC) cell lines SW480 and DLD-1 that contain mutations in
the APC gene that leads to an elevated level of nuclear
b-catenin and aberrant canonical Wnt signaling. SW480 cells
were treated for 24 hours with the compounds at various
concentrations and alterations in central components of the
canonical Wnt pathway were examined using Western blot
analysis. Antibodies against AXIN2, total b-catenin and an
active non-phosphorylated form of b-catenin [active b-catenin
(ABC)], revealed that upon compound treatment the active
form of b-catenin in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments was reduced, whereas cytoplasmic AXIN2 accumulated
remarkably (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3A–C). JW67
increased the steady-state expression of AXIN2 at a minimum
of 1 mmol/L, whereas JW74 increased AXIN2 at 0.1 mmol/L.
JW67 and JW74 decreased ABC levels at 1 mmol/L, and total
b-catenin was mildly reduced by JW67 but strongly decreased
by JW74 (both 5 and 10 mmol/L). At the same time, the
concentration of phosphorylated b-catenin (p-b-catenin),
which represents its degradable form, was elevated.

Overall reduction of the nuclear and cytoplasmic b-catenin was further confirmed by immunofluorescence in SW480
cells, using an anti-b-catenin antibody after 48-hour incubations with 5 or 10 mmol/L of compounds (equal shutter
speed; Supplementary Fig. S5). Moreover, confocal microscopy (different automatic shutter speeds) revealed that the
remaining b-catenin was found to be concentrated in adherence junctions (Fig. 4, arrowheads). AXIN2 was simultaneously reduced in the nucleus and elevated in the
cytoplasm when compared with the controls. Strikingly,
the confocal imaging of double-stained cells revealed aberrant foci in the cytoplasm containing abundant b-catenin
and AXIN2 (arrows in Fig. 4). JW74 treatment yielded most of
such foci that may represent clustered destruction complexes. Taken together, our data may suggest that JW67 and
JW74 primarily act on the stabilization of AXIN2 directly or
through other components leading to enhanced b-catenin
degradation in APC mutant CRCs (Fig. 3D).
Next, we tested whether the increase of AXIN2 and the
phosphorylated b-catenin resulted from altered activities of
major kinases or phosphatases. A diverse panel of phosphatases and kinases was exposed to 10 mmol/L of JW74 in vitro.
None of the tested enzyme activities were considerably influenced by JW74 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
JW67 and JW74 affect the expression of Wnt target
genes and reduce cell growth of colon cancer cell lines
To measure the effect of JW67 and JW74 on Wnt target
genes, a real-time RT-PCR analysis was carried out on the
colorectal cell lines SW480 and DLD-1. A dose-dependent
reduction of AXIN2, SP5, and NKD1 was seen after 72-hour
incubation with 10 or 25 mmol/L of the compounds (Fig. 5A).
JW67 reduced expression of AXIN2 (32%) in SW480 cells (25
mmol/L) and AXIN2 (65%), SP5 (37%), and NKD1 (52%) in DLD1 cells (10 mmol/L). JW74 reduced the expression of AXIN2
(40% and 64%), SP5 (26% and 37%), and NKD1 (24% and 46%)
in SW480 cells (10 and 25 mmol/L, respectively), whereas 10
mmol/L of JW74 reduced the expression of AXIN2 (72%), SP5
(37%), and NKD1 (61%) in DLD-1 cells. At a 10-mmol/L dose,
the effect of both compounds was stronger in DLD-1 than in
SW480 cells, which may be caused by a more extensive
deletion of the APC gene in SW480 than in DLD-1 cells (30).
To gain a general overview of affected gene expression, an
Illumina array was carried out in biological triplicates. Alterations of gene expression were assayed in SW480 cells by using
10 or 25 mmol/L of JW74. JW67 at 10 mmol/L was tested in a
similar setting by using DLD-1 cells. Known Wnt target genes,
as listed on the Wnt homepage (31), were affected by the 2
compounds, including, for example, in the case of JW74treated cells: AXIN2, SP5, NKD1, FZD2, FZD4, DKK1, IL8, EGFR,
CYR61, EFNB2, FOSL1, PTTG1, SNAI2, SALL4, MET, PLAUR,
WISP3, WIF, PITX2, RUNX2, MMP7, ID2, TCF7, BIRC5, CD44,
and CDH13 (Supplementary Table 1). As expected for a
specific inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, some of the
altered genes were found to be differentially expressed in
Ls174T CRC cell line expressing an inducible dominant,
negative form of TCF4 (11). Interestingly, JW74 treatment
in SW480 cells strongly reduced the expression of several

liver metastasis of CRC (32–34).
Next, we tested a panel of CRC cell lines with different
mutations in the Wnt pathway stably transfected with ST-Luc
and Renilla: APC truncated SW480 cells (mutated in codon
1,338), HCT-15 cells (mutated in codon 1,417), and 2 cell lines
with a point mutation in the CK1a-dependent phosphorylation site S45 of b-catenin (HCT116 with 1 mutated allele and
Ls174T with 2 mutated alleles; ref. 35). After 48-hour incubation with various concentrations of JW67 or JW74, dosedependent reductions of the Wnt dependent ST-Luc activities
were quantified (Fig. 5A, right). Corresponding to the real-time
RT-PCR experiment, JW67 affected the reporter signal in
SW480 only at the concentration 25 mmol/L whereas JW74
was effective in the range 2.5 to 10 mmol/L. A more potent
effect was observed in HCT116 cells.
Upon inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling, an arrest in the
G1 phase of the cell cycle can be observed in CRC cell lines (11).
Therefore, the effect of JW67 and JW74 on proliferation was
tested in SW480 cells in an MTS assay. A concentrationdependent reduction in proliferation was shown after
treatment with JW67 and JW74 with GI50 values of 7.8 and
11.8 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. 5B). Control SW480 cells underwent 1.3 cell doublings (mean ¼ Abs490t72 =Abs490t0 ) within

(10–25 mmol/L) may be explained by the hydrophobic properties of the 2 compounds and their poor solubility. JW67: clog P
¼ 1.8, and JW74: clog P ¼ 6.1 (ChemBioDraw; CambridgeSoft).
Plain precipitation of both compounds was observed at 25
mmol/L in aqueous solution (PBS). Only a minor growth
reduction was observed in control cells lacking endogenous
canonical Wnt activity such as HeLa and the human hepatocyte cell line THLE2. In addition, reduced proliferation in the
presence of 5 mmol/L of JW67 or JW74 was monitored over
several passages (1:4 splitting) in SW480 cells. The reduced
growth rate of treated cells persisted during the 9 passages
and resulted in increasingly diluted cell numbers (Fig. 5C).
Abnormal quantities of detached cells, indicating apoptosis or
necrosis, were not seen in any of the proliferation assays.
Next, cell-cycle progression after compound exposure was
measured by bromodeoxyuridine BrdU) labeling of cultured
cells that were counterstained with propidium iodide (PI).
FACS analysis of double-labeled SW480 cells after a 72-hour
treatment with 25 or 10 mmol/L of either JW67 or JW74
showed that the percentage of cells in the S phase decreased
whereas the G1 compartment increased compared with the
DMSO control (Fig. 5D). A 25 mmol/L solution of JW74 nearly
halved the percentage of S-phase cells from 28.4% to 16.2% and

increased G1-phase cells from 37.3% to 46.4%. Taken together,
these data indicate that compounds JW67 and JW74 reduce
growth of SW480 CRC cells in vitro by inhibiting cell-cycle
progression at the G1/S phase as expected for an antagonist of
canonical Wnt signaling.

Following cell culture experiments, the in vivo efficacy of the
compound JW74 was tested using SW480 cell xenografts. JW67
was not included in the xenograft experiment because of a
lower effect in real-time RT-PCR and the reporter assays. A
total of 107 SW480 cells were injected subcutaneously into

were initiated after 7 days when palpable tumors were detected in 50% of the mice. A relatively high dose of JW74 (150
or 300 mg/kg) was used because of a rapid compound
degradation in the organism as indicated in the human liver
microsome analysis (t1/2 ¼ 2.5 minutes) and in pharmacokinetic analyses (after per oral injections: t1/2 ¼ 30 minutes and
intravenous injections: t1/2 ¼ 15 minutes; Supplementary
Fig. S7A). Animals were sacrificed after 29 days. Blood plasma
was harvested and isolated tumors were measured for size and
weight. A reduction of 33% and 35% in mean tumor size was
observed at doses 150 and 300 mg/kg, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6). The statistical significance was calculated
only when the 2 groups (150 and 300 mg/kg) were pooled
together (Mann–Whitney: P ¼ 0.045; Supplementary Fig. S2D).

No obvious adverse side effects, such as weight loss, were
observed during treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7E). The
presence of JW74 in tumors and plasma was identified by
mass spectrometry (ref. 36; Supplementary Fig. S7A and B).
The compound concentration in tumors was in the range 4.2

Next, RNA was isolated from representative tumors (n ¼ 5),
and real-time RT-PCR revealed that SP5 mRNA, a target gene
of canonical Wnt signaling, was downregulated in tumors
treated with JW74 (Supplementary Fig. S7D). Altogether, the
xenograft experiment indicated that JW74 reduced growth of
SW480 CRC cells by in vivo inhibition of Wnt signaling.
JW74 inhibit tumor formation and growth in the small
intestine and colon of ApcMin mice
ApcMin mice (multiple intestinal neoplasia, Min) harbor
mutations in one allele of the Apc tumor suppressor gene
and these mice develop polyposis and colon adenocarcinoma
because of frequent spontaneous mutations in the second
allele (37). Thus, the ApcMin mouse line provides an excellent
animal model for human colon cancer. We tested the effect of
JW74 on tumor formation in these mice after combined
subcutaneous (age ¼ 5–21 days) and oral applications (21
days to 9 weeks; 150 mg/kg of JW74 in 1% Tween-80 or DMSO,
respectively). The small intestine and colon was dissected at
9 weeks and investigated by microscopy. The frequency,
distribution, and size of the tumors were quantified. Effects
on body weight (Supplementary Fig. S8B) or other considerable discomforts were not noticed in the animals. As no
significant difference in tumor frequency in the small intestine
could be seen between sexes (Supplementary Fig. S2E), the
data were combined in 1 group. A significant reduction of
tumor number in the small intestine was detected after
injections with 150 mg/kg of JW74 (mean ¼ 36.1; and median
¼ 35) when compared with the control group (Fig. 6A, left and
right; mean ¼ 74.8, median ¼ 45; Shapiro–Wilk tests failed,
Mann–Whitney: P ¼ 0.036; Supplementary Fig. S2E). When
divided by sex, only the female group achieved significance
(control vs. treatment; Shapiro–Wilk tests failed, Mann–Whitney: P ¼ 0.031; Supplementary Fig. S2E). The small intestine
was divided into several sections according to the distance
from the ventricle (in cm). In mice treated with JW74, the last
two third of the small intestine had substantially fewer total
tumors numbers than the control (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the
tumors could be sorted by size into size classes (in mm2). The
tumors frequencies, especially among those between 0.10 and
3.20 mm2, were drastically reduced after JW74 treatment
(Fig. 6C). In addition, when tumor frequency and size were
combined as a total tumor load (sum of all tumors in mm2/n),
the inhibition of formation and growth of tumors in the small
intestine by JW74 was again clearly documented (control: 38.1
mm2; and JW74: 16.4 mm2; Supplementary Fig. S8A). Next, the
occurrence of tumors was examined in the colon. A statistically
significant reduction of the number of tumors in the colon was
accomplished after JW74 treatment (mean ¼ 0.42; and
median ¼ 0) when compared with the control (mean ¼
1.78; and median ¼ 1; Shapiro–Wilk tests failed, Mann–

Whitney: P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. S2F). The
results from the ApcMin experiments proved that JW74 has
the capacity to reduce the development of intestinal cancer.

Discussion
In this work, 2 chemotypes, JW67 and JW74, were identified
that specifically inhibit canonical Wnt signaling, decreased
Wnt-dependent transcription in CRC cell lines that resulted in
a reduced cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and inhibited polyp
formation in ApcMin mice.
Although a detailed mechanism of action will be investigated in further studies, the inhibitory effect of JW67 and JW74
in LiCl-activated cells and in APC mutant cells indicates that
the compounds may influence the multiprotein complex
consisting of b-catenin/GSK-3b/AXIN/APC /CK1 that controls the degradation of b-catenin. Indeed, submicromolar
concentrations of JW67 or JW74 in CRC APC mutant cells
resulted in the reduction of nuclear active b-catenin that was
accompanied with an increased steady-state level of cytoplasmic AXIN2 and phosphorylated b-catenin. Large foci with
colocalized AXIN2/b-catenin in the cytoplasm, which formed
even in the presence of truncated APC, may therefore represent abnormal b-catenin destruction complexes. Moreover,
the compound treatment not only increased the phosphorylation of b-catenin and inhibited cell growth in CRC APC
mutant cell lines such as SW480 but also reduced canonical
Wnt-signaling in CRC cell lines with point mutations in the
b-catenin gene. The ST-Luc activity was reduced in the
HCT116 line carrying a single point mutation at S45 (CK1a
phosphorylation site) in one b-catenin allele and in Ls174T
line with the same mutation in both alleles. Both these lines
thus retain b-catenin that can be phosphorylated in other
phosphorylation sites (e.g. S33, S37, T41; ref. 38). We further
note that Wnt induction by overexpression of wild-type
b-catenin was counteracted by JW67 or JW74 in ST-Luc
assays. In striking contrast, the compounds had insignificant
effect upon transiently transfected b-catenin with all mutated
phosphorylation sites (S33, S37, T41, and S45). The 2 compounds thus may affect phosphorylation of b-catenin by
several mechanisms, including altered phosphatase activity
or an increased GSK-3b activity, stabilization of the b-catenin
destruction complex, or an augmented negative regulatory
feedback loop involving AXIN2. We hypothesize that the
observed high amount of AXIN2 augments the formation of
the multiprotein degradation complex as illustrated in the
scheme (Fig. 3D). At present, we conduct several experiments
with the aim to identify the compounds’ direct targets.
Potential targets may include proteins such as AXIN2, components that affect AXIN2 stability or other hitherto unknown
proteins interacting with the degradation complex.
Two recent studies present novel small molecule inhibitors
of the canonical Wnt pathway that increase AXIN2 levels
despite APC mutations (22, 23). XAV939 inhibits the PARP
domain of Tankyrase 1 and 2 that destabilizes AXIN2 by
PARsylation (23). IWR-1 also stabilizes endogenous TNKS1
and TNKS2 proteins and increases AXIN2 protein, although
the precise mechanism remains elusive (22). Neither JW67 nor

JW74 is structurally similar to IWR-1 or XAV939 and shows
efficacy in submicromolar concentrations in similar assays.
The decreased rate of polyp formation in ApcMin mice,
particularly in the colon after treatment with JW74,
classifies this compound among the small molecules that
are plausible candidates for future human therapy of CRC.
The dose of 150 mg/kg of JW74 in ApcMin model reduced the
small intestinal adenoma by 48% (calculated from mean
values in Fig. 6A) and is comparable, for example, with
celecoxib (150 or 500 mg/kg: 71%; ref. 39) or rofecoxib, an
analog of celecoxib (75 mg/kg: 45%; ref. 40). It is noteworthy
that JW74 becomes rapidly cleared from the blood stream
because of poor in vivo stability (Supplementary Fig. 7A). At
present, we test a large panel of structural analogues that may
yield a stabilized structure and thus an increased efficacy in
vivo. Investigation of the chemical space that influences the
b-catenin destruction complex seems to be an increasingly
important entry point for pharmacologic interventions of the
canonical Wnt signaling.
