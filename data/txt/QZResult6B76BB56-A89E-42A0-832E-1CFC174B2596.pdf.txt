Abstract
Author Manuscript

The Snail1 transcriptional repressor plays a key role in triggering epithelial to mesenchymal
transition. Although Snail1 is widely expressed in early development, in adult animals it is limited
to a subset of mesenchymal cells where it has a largely unknown function. Using a mouse model
with inducible depletion of Snail1, here we demonstrate that Snail1 is required to maintain
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). This effect is associated to the responsiveness to TGF-β1 which
shows a strong Snail1 dependence. Snail1-depletion in conditional knock-out adult animals causes
a significant decrease in the number of bone marrow-derived MSCs. In culture, Snail1-deficient
MSCs prematurely differentiate to osteoblasts or adipocytes and, in contrast to controls, are
resistant to the TGF-β1-induced differentiation block. These results demonstrate a new role for
Snail1 in TGF-β response and MSC maintenance.

INTRODUCTION
Snail1 is a transcriptional factor that initiates the epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and enables epithelial cells to acquire migratory properties (1, 2). Accordingly,
Snail1 ectopic transfection represses the expression of epithelial genes such as E-cadherin
(3, 4), a key element for maintaining the epithelial phenotype. Snail1 also participates in the
expression of mesenchymal genes, both indirectly, releasing the inhibition caused on
transcriptional activators by E-cadherin, and also directly through the binding to
mesenchymal promoters (5, 6). Besides the effects on EMT, Snail1 provides additional
functions since it bestows epithelial cells with a higher resistance to apoptosis and cancer
stem cell characteristics (1, 2). Probably reflecting these pleiotropic functions, Snail1 is
subjected to a tight control, affecting both the transcription of the gene and the stability of
the protein (2).

Author Manuscript

Although Snail1 is expressed at different stages during embryo development and is required
for specific processes, such as gastrulation or generation of left-right asymmetry (7, 8), the
expression of this protein is very restricted in adult mice (9). For instance, Snail1 is not
expressed by tissue-resident fibroblasts and is only detected in these cells when activated;
thus, during the process of wound-healing or in the stroma of several types of epithelial
tumors (9). Even in these neoplasias, Snail1 is only detected in the tumor-stroma interface in
areas of invasion, or in cells next to areas of inflammation (9-11). These results indicate that
Snail1, although required for triggering EMT, is not necessary for maintain the
mesenchymal phenotype. Accordingly, in cultured primary fibroblasts Snail1 expression is
not constitutive and is dependent on serum (8, 12).

Author Manuscript

Therefore, the specific properties that Snail1 confers to mesenchymal cells are still a matter
of research. Genetic Snail1 depletion in murine embryo fibroblasts has revealed a role for
this gene in the control of genes essential for invasion, such as membrane type-1 matrix
metalloprotease (12). However, other functions of Snail1 in these cells have not been
characterized and evidence that Snail1 controls stem cell-like properties has not been
reported yet. Here we have analyzed the role of Snail1 in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
using a mouse model with inducible depletion of Snail1. Our results indicate that Snail1
expression is required to maintain MSCs in adult animals and for the complete response to
TGF-β in these cells.

RESULTS
Snail1 induced the expression of activation markers in fibroblasts

Author Manuscript

We analyzed the expression of Snail1 protein in a panel of fibroblastic lines in culture. The
basal levels of Snail1 in these cells differ, with the highest expression observed in NIH-3T3
(Fig 1A). Moreover, as reported in epithelial cells (13), Snail1 protein increased following
treatment with TGF-β1 in all the cell lines examined (Fig 1A). A kinetic analysis performed
in L1 cells indicated that Snail1 was up-regulated after 30 minutes of incubation with TGFβ1, much faster than S100A4, a marker of active fibroblasts (Fig 1B).

To check if Snail1 over-expression mimics the effects of TGF-β1, Snail1 was ectopically
expressed in 3T3-L1 and C2C12 and the selected populations were analyzed by western
blot. Snail1 transfectants showed elevated expression of S100A4 as well as TGFB1 and
TGFB2 genes and TGF-β1 and -β2 precursor proteins (Figs 1C and D). Therefore Snail1 is
not only activated by TGF-β1 but also induces the expression of this cytokine.
Snail1 is relevant for TGF-β1-induced stimulation in the expression of TGFB1 gene (Fig
1E). Preventing Snail1 up-regulation with a specific shRNA impaired the increased TGFB1
expression caused by TGF-β1 (Fig 1E), indicating that Snail1 is required for perpetuating
this cycle. Moreover, Snail1 shRNA also blocked the TGF-β1-induced up-regulation in
S100A4 mRNA (Fig 1E).
Snail1 prevents the differentiation of mesenchymal cells

Author Manuscript

Under appropriate conditions, 3T3-L1 cells rapidly differentiate to an adipocytic phenotype,
a conversion blocked by incubation with TGF-β1 (14). Ectopic expression of Snail1 to levels
comparable to those obtained by treatment with the cytokine prevented the morphological
differentiation of these cells, as assessed by Oil Red-O staining (Fig 2A). Similar to TGF-β1,
ectopic Snail1 blocked the induction of adipocytic markers, such as Glut4 or C/EBP2,
although did not modify the levels of other proteins, such as the glucocorticoid receptor or
pyruvate kinase (PyrK) (Fig 2B). A transcriptionally inactive Snail1 mutant with a proline to
alanine substitution in position 2 (P2A), unable to repress E-cadherin and other target genes
(3), did not block differentiation. Although not as much as the L1 cells transfected with the
control plasmid, L1 cells expressing Snail1-P2A mutant were stained with Oil Red-O and
showed Glut 4 expression (Figs 2A and C).

Author Manuscript

Similar assays were performed with the C2C12 cell line that differentiates to myotubes after
reaching confluence and serum starved. The Snail1 protein levels inversely correlated with
differentiation: four days after reaching confluence the levels of the protein were downregulated with respect to day 0, in contrast to those of the myotube marker myogenin, which
was up-regulated (Fig S1B). Ectopic expression of Snail1 also blocked the differentiation of
these cells, since it prevented the formation of myotubes (Fig S1A) and the increase in two
characteristic markers, myogenin and Myf-6 (Fig S1C).

Author Manuscript

A similar inhibition was also observed in the differentiation of cultured murine MSC
obtained from mouse bone marrow. TGF–β1 induced a rapid increase in Snail1 expression
in these cells (Fig S2A) and blocked its conversion to osteoblasts or adipocytes (see below).
MSCs differentiation into these two phenotypes was accompanied with a down-regulation in
Snail1 protein (Fig 3A). When ectopically expressed, in non-differentiated MSCs Snail1
induced an up-regulation of markers of activated fibroblasts, such S100A4, and of MSCs,
such as CD29, CD44 or CD105 (15) (Fig 3B, top panel, and Fig 3H). TGFB1 and TGFB2
RNA levels were also slightly increased (Fig 3B, bottom panel) as well as active TGF-β1 in
the cell medium (97 ± 9 versus 70 ± 15 pg/ml, as calculated by ELISA). Even although
differences in active TGF-β1 were low, MSC-Snail1 cells showed increased endogenous
activation of TGF-β receptor with respect to controls, determined analyzing Smad2
phosphorylation (Fig 3C). This result was due to a greater sensitivity to TGF-β1 in MSCSnail1 cells than in control MSCs (Fig S2B). The relevance of endogenous TGF-β signaling

for Snail1 expression was also examined using two TGF-β receptor inhibitors, SB505124
(SB) (16) and LY-2157299 (LY2) (17), These compounds did not modify the Snail1 protein
levels in preconfluent C2C12 and only did it very slightly in L1 or MSCs cells (Fig S3A),
Their effect on markers of activated fibroblasts, such as S100A4 or CD29, was also low. As
a control, both inhibitors prevent the up-regulation in phosphoSmad2, Snail1 or CD29
caused by TGF-β (Fig S3B). Therefore, these results indicate that autocrine TGF-β did not
significantly contribute to Snail1 expression in these cells.

Author Manuscript

Overexpression of Snail1 completely prevented MSCs from differentiating to osteoblasts, as
determined by staining with the specific dye Alizarin Red (Fig 3D), measuring the activity
of the osteoblast marker alkaline phosphatase (AP) (Fig 3E) or analyzing the expression of
Osterix (Osx) transcriptional factor (Fig 3E, side). Similar results were obtained when these
cells were challenged to differentiate to adipocytes: Snail1-expressing MSCs did not show
evidence of differentiation, as assessed by Oil Red-O staining and Glut 4 levels (Fig 3F and
G).

Author Manuscript

Up-regulated expression of TGF-β1 was retained in Snail1-transfected MSCs when induced
to differentiate to osteoblasts (Fig 3E). Since TGF-β1 prevented MSCs osteogenic
differentiation (Fig S4A), we asked whether the ability of Snail1 to block this process was
due to the expression of this cytokine. Supplementation of the differentiation medium with
the TGF-β receptor inhibitors SB or LY2 did not prevent the block caused by Snail1 overexpression on MSC differentiation to osteoblasts, as shown by Alizarin Red staining (Fig
S4A) or measuring AP activity (Fig S4B). As expected, these inhibitors counteract the TGFβ block of osteoblast conversion (Figs S4A and B). SB did not affect the up-regulation in
CD44 or S100A4 promoted by Snail1 although it prevented that caused by TGF–β (Fig
S4C). As shown above, both inhibitors also avoided TGF-β-dependent up-regulation in
Snail1 or CD29 or the increase in Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig S3B).These results indicate
that Snail1 block of osteoblastic differentiation is not due to TGF-β1 secretion.

Author Manuscript

Next we examined the relevance of other signaling elements in Snail1-induced block of
differentiation. Activation of PI3Kinase/Akt pathway is required for TGF-β1 expression in
MSCs (18). As in epithelial cells (19), Snail1 over-expression down-regulated PTEN levels
and stimulated Akt activity, determined measuring the extent of the phosphorylation at the
key residue Ser473 (Fig 4A). The widely used PI3 Kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY-294002 (LY)
blocked the Snail1-dependent activation of Akt and also the induction of CD44 and S100A4
but not that of CD29 or CD105 (Fig 4A). PI3K and Akt inhibition significantly reversed the
effects of Snail1 on osteogenic differentiation; upon incubation with LY Snail1-transfected
MSCs were stained with Alizarin Red and showed up-regulated AP activity with respect to
untreated Snail1-MSCs (Figs 4B and C). Two other inhibitors of PI3K/Akt pathway,
wortmannin and the Akt-inhibitor MK2066 (MK) also avoided the Snail1 action (Figs 4B
and C). Conversely, ectopic expression of an activated form of Akt prevented osteoblast
differentiation (Figs 4C and D) although it did not stimulate Snail1 expression (Fig 4E),
further indicating that Akt works downstream Snail1 in the prevention of MSCs
differentiation.

The ability of MSCs to differentiate to chondrocytes was also analyzed. Ectopic expression
of Snail1 in the MSCs did not affect the number of chondrocytes generated from them, as
determined by staining with the specific dye Alcian Blue (Fig S5A). Expression of Snail1
was not decreased but rather up-regulated during differentiation into chondrocytes,
concomitantly to Col II, a marker of this process (Fig S5B). The detection of Snail1 in
embryonic or adult chondrocytes (Fig S5C and D) also supports the conclusion that, in
contrast to the observed inhibitory effects on MSC conversion into adipocytes or osteoblasts,
Snail1 does not prevent the process of differentiation to chondrocytes. Snail1 was also
expressed by primary chondrocytes in culture and declined when the cells became senescent
(Fig S5E).
Snail1 depletion affects the number of bone marrow MSCs in vivo

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We next analyzed MSCs obtained from murine bone marrow of mice deficient for Snail
expression. For this, we engineered a mouse bearing Snail1 null and Snail1 floxed alleles,
combined with a tamoxifen inducible Cre recombinase under the control of the ubiquitously
active β-Actin promoter (β-act/Cre-ER). To avoid embryonic lethality (7), Snail1 was
depleted by injecting tamoxifen in two month-old Snail1Flox/−, β-Act-Cre-ER mice (adult
animals); Snail1Flox/+, β-Act-Cre-ER were used as controls. After one week, MSCs were
harvested from femur marrow. FACS analysis revealed that the number of cells negative for
the hematopoietic marker CD45 and positive for CD105 or CD90, two markers of MSCs
(15, 20), was much lower in Snail1-KO mice than in controls (Fig 5A). Snail1-depleted
animals presented lower number of bone marrow cells capable to attach to the plate, a
characteristic of MSCs (only 33 % ± 11 of the number obtained in control animals). As
expected, Snail1 protein was not detected in cells obtained from Snail1-null animals (Fig
5B); two other MSC markers, CD29 and CD44, were also absent from these cells. A similar
down-regulation was also detected in S1004A protein (Fig 5B) and in the expression of
TGFB1 and TGFB2 genes (Fig 5C).
To check whether the effect of Snail1 was cell autonomous, similar analyses were
performed in MSCs isolated from Snail1Flox/− mice prior to injection of tamoxifen and
treated with hidroxi-tamoxifen (TAM-OH) in culture. Three days after addition of this drug,
Snail1 protein was totally down-regulated as well as CD29, CD44 and S100A4 (Fig 5D).
TGFB1 and TGFB2 RNAs were also markedly decreased in Snail1-KO cells (Fig 5E).
Snail1-depleted cells also showed a slower proliferation with a higher number of cells in G1
than control cells (76 compared with 52%), without signs of apoptosis.

Author Manuscript

Snail1-KO cells (Snail1Flox/− treated with TAM-OH) differentiated faster than controls
(Snail1Flox/+). Snail1 KO MSCs were stained with the osteoblast specific dye Alizarin Red
(Fig 6A) and showed increased levels of AP activity (Fig 6B) three days after addition of the
differentiation medium. After ten days of incubation the differences were lower, since
control cells had also undergone differentiation (see Fig 3D and E). Similar effects were
obtained when these cells were challenged to differentiate into adipocytes. At day four,
when no accumulation of fat was detected in control cells, Snail1-KO cells were strongly
stained with Oil Red-O (Fig 6C), and showed up-regulated expression of Glut4 with respect
to control cells (Fig 6D).

Snail1-depleted MSCs showed signs of spontaneous differentiation even when cultured in
DME medium. Fifteen days after reaching confluency these cultures presented areas with fat
droplets (Fig S6A) and had an up-regulated expression of the adipocytic protein Glut4 (Fig
S6B). In contrast, these cells did not differentiate to chondrocytes, even when cultured in the
optimal conditions, as visualized staining with the specific dye Alcian Blue (Fig S6C).
Snail1 depletion prevents TGF-β1-block of MSCs differentiation

Author Manuscript

As mentioned above (Fig S2A), Snail1 was quickly up-regulated by TGF-β1 in MSCs, much
faster than S100A4. We examined the relevance of Snail1 for the TGF-β1 response in these
cells. Addition of TGF-β1 (one day before challenging the MSCs with the differentiation
medium) prevented the conversion of MSCs into osteoblasts. On the contrary, MSCs
deficient for Snail1 were resistant to TGF-β1 block and showed elevated AP (Fig 6B) and
Alizarin Red stainning (Fig 6E). We observed similar results when MSCs were induced to
differentiate to adipocytes: in contrast to control cells, MSCs deficient for Snail1
differentiated even in the presence of TGF-β (Fig S7).

Author Manuscript

TGF-β1 responses were examined in undifferentiated MSCs. Although initial effects of
TGF-β1, such as Smad2 phosphorylation, were detected, Snail1-depleted cells showed no or
severely impaired up-regulation of different TGF-β1 targets, such as CD44, CD29, CD105,
S100A4, PAI-1, TGFB1 or TGFB2, as determined by RT-PCR (Fig 6F) or Western Blot
(Fig 6G). However, unresponsiveness to TGF-β1 was not general, since Smad7 expression
was stimulated by TGF-β1 in Snail1-KO MSCs. Snail1-depleted MSCs did not show
increased Akt activity or PTEN down-regulation upon TGF-β1 stimulation, in contrasts to
control MSCs (Fig 6H, upper panel). This PTEN down-regulation by TGF-β1 was
associated to lower mRNA levels (Fig 6H, lower) and Snail1 binding to PTEN promoter
(Fig 6I); as expected, these two TGF-β1 effects were not observed in Snail1-depleted cells.

Author Manuscript

Addition of PI3K/Akt inhibitors blocked the TGF-β1-induced up-regulation of a subset
(CD44, S100A4, PAI-1) of Snail1-dependent genes (Fig 7A). More importantly, both LY
and MK precluded the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation caused by TGF-β1 (Fig 7B and
C), suggesting that Akt activation was also required for the TGF-β induced block of this
conversion. We noticed that TGF-β only stopped differentiation when added before starting
this process since, when supplemented one day after the differentiation medium, cells
matured normally (Fig 7B and C). Therefore, in these experiments, and in those previously
described for Snail1 transfectants (see Figure 4), PI3K/Akt inhibitors were supplemented to
the medium only during the first days of the differentiation (from D-1 to D+2). When added
at later times (D+4), they did not prevent the TGF-β block; on the contrary, LY downregulated the accumulation of differentiation markers in control cells (Fig 7C and D),
suggesting an additional role for Akt in the late steps of differentiation. In accordance with
its lack on effect on differentiation, at D+1 TGF-β1 did not up-regulate Akt activity (Fig
7E). The initial responses to this cytokine, such as Smad2 phosphorylation were identical at
both times.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

In this article we have analyzed the relevance of Snail1 expression in fibroblastic cells. Our
results show that besides increasing markers of activated fibroblasts, Snail1 controls the
differentiation of mesenchymal cell lines. Snail1 declines during the process of
differentiation; a modest Snail1 ectopic up-regulation, similar to that obtained upon
incubation with TGF-β, was sufficient to block differentiation of 3T3-L1 or C2C12 to
adipocytes or myotubes, respectively. Similar and more relevant results were obtained in
murine MSCs. In these cells, Snail1 ectopic expression prevented their conversion into
osteoblasts or adipocytes, whereas Snail1 depletion accelerated them. In contrast, Snail1
ectopic expression did not block the differentiation of MSCs to chondrocytes whereas this
process did not happen in Snail1-depleted MSCs. These results are compatible with those
published by Nieto and co-workers showing that a forced expression of Snail1 modulates
bone growth by controlling chondrocyte proliferation and inhibiting osteoblast
differentiation (21, 22). Actually, MSCs conversion into osteoblast or chondrocytes, besides
being inversely controlled by Snail1, is also differently sensitive to TGF- β; whereas
osteoblastic differentiation was inhibited by TGF-β, chondrocytic conversion required the
addition of TGF-β to the differentiation medium. Accordingly, and contrary to what happens
in the other cases, Snail1 expression is up-regulated in chondrocytes with respect to MSCs,
and is required for chondrocytic differentiation (Fig S6C). Therefore, our results indicate
that, as discussed below, Snail1 is necessary for a full TGF-β response in MSCs and for the
control of MSC differentiation by this cytokine.

Author Manuscript

Genetic depletion of Snail1 expression in adult mice confirmed these results. Upon
tamoxifen injection and Snail1 obliteration, the number of bone marrow MSCs was
markedly decreased. The effect of Snail1 on bone marrow MSCs is cell autonomous, since
depletion of Snail1 in vitro also affected the expression of MSCs makers in this population
and accelerated their differentiation to osteoblasts or adipocytes when challenged with the
appropriate stimulus. These results strongly indicate that Snail1 is required for the
maintenance of MSCs. Curiously, another member of the Snail1 family, Slug (Snail2), has
been implicated in adipogenesis since Snail2 knock out animals show decreased adipose
tissue and Snail2 over-expression enhances adipogenesis (23). These results suggest a
different action of both Snail proteins in this process: whereas Snail1 would be required for
the maintenance of the undifferentiated phenotype by MSCs, Snail2 would be necessary for
the specific induction of the adipogenic program. It is possible that this Snail2 effect would
be dependent on the repression of Snail1 expression, since Snail1 promoter contains a
functional E-box, putative binding site for Snail2 (24). In any case, these results point to an
important role of Snail proteins in the control of adipogenesis.

Author Manuscript

Snail1 expression is required for a full TGF-β response. In our assays,1) Snail1 was rapidly
up-regulated by this cytokine and stimulated TGF- β synthesis and sensitivity; 2) it was
required for the activation of many TGF- β targets in MSCs; and 3) it was necessary for the
control by this cytokine of MSCs differentiation. However, although Snail1 plays a role in
TGF- β-induced gene activation, this does not imply that Snail1-depleted cells are totally
resistant to this cytokine. Snail1-KO cells showed initial responses, as indicated by the
Smad2 phosphorylation and Smad7 up-regulation in response to the cytokine.

Page 8

Author Manuscript

Our results show that Snail1 and TGF-β1 participate in a self-stimulatory loop amplifying
the expression of both proteins, since TGF-β1 stimulates its own synthesis and Snail1
enhances the expression of its inducer, TGF-β1. TGF-β1 is a potent inhibitor of adipogenesis
and osteoblastogenesis; however, the effect of Snail1 on MSCs differentiation was not
dependent on the expression of this cytokine. Although the increase in active TGF-β1 in the
supernatant in MSCs upon Snail1 transfection was relevant since it stimulated Smad2
phosphorylation, inhibition of TGF-β receptor did not prevent Snail1 block of osteoblastic
differentiation.

Author Manuscript

The lack of response to TGF-β1 in gene induction and differentiation is associated to the
inability to down-regulate PTEN and activate Akt. As previously reported in other cell
systems (25-27), TGF-β1 stimulated Akt activity in MSCs, as well as it decreased the levels
of PTEN, a direct Snail1 transcriptional target (13). Snail1-dependent PTEN depletion
contributes to Akt up-regulation in other cells systems (13, 28), although a transcriptionalindependent activation of Akt has also been reported (29) and is probably necessary for the
complete stimulation of this protein kinase. In Snail1-depleted MSCs TGF-β was unable to
stimulate Akt. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway prevented Snail1 or TGF-β
activation of several target genes and, more importantly, impeded the Snail1 or TGF-β1
block of osteogenic differentiation. It is noteworthy that TGF-β effects on differentiation are
temporally controlled, and when cells had initiated the conversion, they became insensitive
to TGF-β block. Concomitantly, TGF-β did not stimulate Akt activity at these later times.

Author Manuscript

The specific role of Akt in MSCs differentiation is still controversial and has been suggested
to regulate it both positively and negatively (30, 31). Our results suggest a dual action of this
protein kinase since, besides being relevant for the maintenance of MSCs, it is also required
for completion of the differentiation (see Fig 7). It is possible that, as shown for another
Snail1-governed cellular conversion, EMT, different Akt isoforms play a contrary role in the
control of this process (32). Recent results indicating an opposite action of Akt1 and Akt2
on osteoblastic differentiation (33) support this hypothesis. . Alternatively, the same Akt
isoform might play both roles, cooperating with Snail1 in the nucleus (29) in the
maintenance of the undifferentiated phenotype, and acting in the cytosol, independently of
Snail1 to complete the process. More research should be performed to characterize the
specific function of Akt isoforms in the maintenance and differentiation of MSCs, as well as
to characterize the TGF-β- and Snail1-sensitive genes controlling MSC conversion in the
different phenotypes. In any case, our results indicate a crucial role for Snail1 in MSCs,
integrating TGF-β and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and maintaining these cells in the
multipotent state.

Actin-CreER, Snail1 null (Snail1−), Snail1 flox were further analyzed. Animals bearing one
copy of the wild-type Snail1 gene were used as controls. Activation of Cre recombinase was
induced in 2 months-old animal by four peritoneal injections of tamoxifen (0.1 mg per g of
mouse weight, dissolved in corn oil) at alternative days. All mice involved in this study were
maintained in a rodent barrier facility in order to guarantee the specific pathogen free health
status of the animals. All animal experiments were previously approved by the Animal
Research Ethical Committee from the PRBB.
MSCs Culture and Differentiation

Author Manuscript

Murine Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) were obtained as indicated (35) and cultured in
DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). When indicated, cell medium was
supplemented with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) (Peprotech), SB-505124 (5 μM), LY-294002 (25 μM),
Wortmannin (1 μM) (all from Sigma), MK-2206 (10 μM) (Selleck), or LY-2157299 (2 μM)
(a kind gift of Dr. E. Batlle, IRB, Barcelona). Osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was
performed adding 100 nM dexamethasone, 10 mM β–glycerophosphate, 50 μM L-ascorbic
acid-2- phosphate to a confluent culture for three days. Cells were cultured in DMEM plus
10% FBS for ten additional days and either stained with by Alizarin Red or used to prepare
cell extracts in 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 to assay Alkaline
Phosphatase activity. Enzymatic activity was determined using p-nitrophenylphosphate as
substrate in 50 mM 2-amino-2- methylpropanol and 2 mM MgCl2 at pH 10.5.The amount of
p-nitrophenyl released was estimated measuring the absorbance at 410 nm.

Author Manuscript

For adipogenic differentiation, cell were incubated with 1 μM dexamethasone, 0.2 mM
indomethacin, 0.1 mg/ml insulin, 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine in DME medium plus
10% FBS. Stimulation was started when cells reached full confluency; cells were grown for
three days in induction medium, for five days in maintenance medium (DMEM plus FBS
and insulin) and switched again to the induction medium for three additional days. After 14
days, adipocytic differentiation was assessed staining with by Oil Red-O or determining
Glut4 expression by western blot.

Author Manuscript

MSCs were differentiated to chondrocytes using the micromass culture technique. 2.5 × 105
cells were pelleted under low-speed centrifugation, and the mass of cells was formed at the
bottom of the conical centrifuge tube was maintained in the chondrogenic medium for 2
weeks. The chondrogenic medium consists in DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with 10
ng/ml TGF-β3 (Peprotech), 1.25 mg/ml BSA, 0.2 mM ascorbic acid, 0.1 μM dexamethasone
and 5 μg/ml Insulin. Regular DMEM was used as control. After 14 days, the specimens were
fixed, dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. Alcian blue staining was used to
assess the formation of extracellular matrix, which is the mark of chondrogenic
differentiation. Cells were counterstained with Nuclear Red (Sigma). Alternatively, cell
extracts were prepared and analysed by western blot with the indicated antibodies.
Other methods are detailed in Supplementary Information.

Fig 1. Snail1 induces the expression of markers of activated fibroblasts

Author Manuscript

Cell populations were transfected with either pcDNA3-Snail1-HA or pcDNA3 control, or
with shRNAs specific for Snail1 or a scrambled control. Where mentioned, cell lines were
treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 24 hours or for the time indicated. Protein (A, B, D and E,
lower panel) or RNA (C, and E upper panel) levels were determined by western blot o semiquantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Pyruvate Kinase (PyrK) was used as loading control in
the western blots; HPRT, in the RT-PCR analysis. The results are representative of three
experiments.

Fig 2. Snail1 prevents the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes

Author Manuscript

Control cells or 3T3-L1 transfected with control plasmid, Snail1 wild-type or P2A mutant
were cultured in regular DME medium or in differentiation medium for two days after the
cells arrived to confluence. Culture medium was replaced by DME medium plus 10% FBS
(see Methods) and after two more days cells were either stained with Oil Red (panel A) or
homogenized in order to get protein cell extracts (panels B and C). Protein expression was
determined using antibodies against Snail1, C/EBPα, Glut4, Glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
or PyrK as loading control. When indicated, TGF- β1 (5 ng/ml) was supplemented to the
medium at the same moment that the cells arrived to confluence and two days later. The
figure shows representative results of at least three experiments performed.

Murine MSCs were transfected with pcDNA3-Snail1-HA or the empty plasmid as control.
Protein expression was determined by western blot with the indicated antibodies from
extracts prepared from MSCs differentiated to osteoblasts (for 10 days) or adipocytes (14
days) as indicated in Methods (A), or not-differentiated (B top, and C). As control for
differentiated cells in panel A (not differentiated), cells were incubated with DMEM plus
FBS rather than differentiation medium. RNA was also extracted from MSCs transfected or
not with Snail1-HA before being challenged to differentiate and analyzed by RT-PCR for
TGFB1 and TGFB2 expression (B, bottom). In panel C, TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) was added to the
cell medium 24 hours before preparing the extracts. (D-G); cells were differentiated to
osteoblasts (D and E) or adipocytes (F and G); to determine osteoblast differentiation, cells
were stained with Alizarin Red (D); alternatively, cell extracts were prepared and AP
activity was determined (E, left) or Osx RNA analyzed (E, right). Adipocytes were stained
with Oil Red-O (F); the presence of the differentiation marker Glut4 was determined by
western blot (G).

(A); the expression of the indicated proteins was determined in undifferentiated MSCs
treated with LY (25 μM) for 24 hours before preparing the extracts. As in Figs 3A and B,
cells were pretreated for 15 hours in DMEM medium plus 2% FBS. (B and C); Snail1transfected MSCs were incubated in osteoblasts differentiation medium for 10 days in the
presence of LY, MK, or Wortmannin from one day before adding the medium until two days
later (see also Fig 7). Differentiation was determined staining with Alizarin Red (B) or
measuring AP activity (C). Results are representative, or show the average ± range of three
experiments. (D, E); a constitutively active form of Akt (CA-Akt), tagged with an HAepitope, was transfected to MSCs. Cells were selected, challenged to differentiate for ten
days and stained with Alizarin Red (D). The expression of CA-Akt was checked by western
blot (E); since Thr308 and Ser473 are mutated in this form (36), CA-Akt activity was
determined analyzing S6 phosphorylation.

Fig 5. Snail1 controls the number of bone marrow MSCs in vivo

Author Manuscript

Femur marrow cells were isolated from Snail1Flox/+ or Snail1Flox/− animals one week after
injection of tamoxifen. (A); cells were analyzed by FACS analysis with antibodies against
CD45 and CD105 or CD45 and CD90 antibodies. The percentage of CD45-/CD105+ or
CD44-/CD90+ cells is presented for both types of animals. The results show the average ±
SD of three experiments performed (B and C) Cells were attached to the cell culture plates
and grown for other seven days. Protein extracts (panel B) or total RNA (panel C) was
prepared and analyzed. In parallel experiments, bone marrow MSCs were obtained from
FloxSnail1/del animals prior to treatment with tamoxifen (TAM); cells were then incubated
with hidroxi-tamoxifen (TAM-OH) (1 μM) for two days. Twenty four hours later, the
indicated proteins (D) or RNAs (E) were analyzed as above.

Fig 6. Snail1 depletion promotes the premature differentiation of MSCs and inhibits the
response to TGF-β1

Author Manuscript

MSCs were obtained from Snail1Flox/− animals prior to treatment with tamoxifen, grown to
confluency and incubated with TAM-OH for two days. TAM-OH was removed and, after 24
hours, cells were supplemented with the osteoblasts differentiation medium (A, B and E).
The extent of differentiation was determined staining with Alizarin Red (A, E) or measuring
AP (B). When indicated cells were treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) one day before adding
TAM-OH as indicated in Methods. (C, D); similar experiments were carried out but
differentiating cells to adipocytes as described in Fig 3. Differentiation was determined by
Oil Red-O staining (C) four days after initiating the process (note that the result presented in
Fig 3 was obtained after 14 days) or analyzing Glut4 expression. (F-H); two days after
removal of TAM-OH cells were treated with TGF-β1 for 24 hours; the levels of the
indicated RNAs (F and H, lower panel) or proteins (G and H, upper panel) were determined
as previously described. (I); chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed
in control or Snail1-depleted MSCs treated or not with TGF-β as indicated in Methods, to
determine Snail1 binding to PTEN promoter. The results show the average ± SD of three
experiments performed.

induced to differentiate to osteoblasts; one day before adding the differentiation medium
(D-1) TGF-β1 was supplemented with LY or MK when indicated and maintained until D+2.
Differentiation was assessed by Alizarin Red Staining (B, D) or measuring AP activity (C)
at D+10. Alternatively, TGF-β1 was added at D+1 and maintained until D+8, or LY added
at D+4. Panel E; MSCs, one day before reaching confluence and adding the differentiation
medium (D-1) or one day after (D+1), were incubated with TGF-β for 20 hours. Cell
extracts were prepared an analysed by western blot.
