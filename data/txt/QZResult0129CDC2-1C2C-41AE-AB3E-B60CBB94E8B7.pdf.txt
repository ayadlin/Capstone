ABSTRACT
DDX3X (DDX3), a human RNA helicase, is over expressed in multiple breast cancer
cell lines and its expression levels are directly correlated to cellular aggressiveness.
NZ51, a ring-expanded nucleoside analogue (REN) has been reported to inhibit the
ATP dependent helicase activity of DDX3. Molecular modeling of NZ51 binding to DDX3
indicated that the 5:7-fused imidazodiazepine ring of NZ51 was incorporated into the
ATP binding pocket of DDX3. In this study, we investigated the anticancer properties
of NZ51 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. NZ51 treatment decreased
cellular motility and cell viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with IC50 values
in the low micromolar range. Biological knockdown of DDX3 in MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cells resulted in decreased proliferation rates and reduced clonogenicity.
In addition, NZ51 was effective in killing breast cancer cells under hypoxic conditions
with the same potency as observed during normoxia. Mechanistic studies indicated
that NZ51 did not cause DDX3 degradation, but greatly diminished its functionality.
Moreover, in vivo experiments demonstrated that DDX3 knockdown by shRNA resulted
in reduced tumor volume and metastasis without altering tumor vascular volume
or permeability-surface area. In initial in vivo experiments, NZ51 treatment did not
significantly reduce tumor volume. Further studies are needed to optimize drug
formulation, dose and delivery. Continuing work will determine the in vitro-in vivo
correlation of NZ51 activity and its utility in a clinical setting.

percentage of all breast cancers. Thus, investigations
aimed at identifying etiological agents that contribute to
breast cancer biogenesis must be undertaken if the vast
majority of breast cancer patients are to be helped. One
such agent is the environmental pollutant, benzo[a]pyrene
diol epoxide (BPDE), which can form stable DNA adducts
[5–7]. Previously, our laboratory reported the oncogenic
role of BPDE in human breast epithelial cells [8] and
identified an RNA helicase, DDX3X (DDX3), as a
contributing factor [9]. We demonstrated that DDX3 was

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer
related death in American women [1]. A number of factors
such as nulliparity, age, hormonal factors, alcohol intake
and environmental factors, alone or in combination,
have been associated with breast cancer incidence and
progression [2–4]. Although genetic predispositions to
breast cancer are directly correlated to a high likelihood
of incidence, these cases represent a relatively low

upregulated after exposing immortalized non-tumorigenic
breast epithelial cells, MCF 10A, to BPDE. Furthermore,
stable over-expression of DDX3 in MCF 10A induced
an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
promoted aggressive properties including increased
motility, invasiveness and colony formation in soft agar.
Also, DDX3 over-expression downregulated E-cadherin
expression resulting in the translocation of β-catenin into
the nucleus [9]. Importantly, we demonstrated that DDX3
expression directly correlated with high-grade human
patient breast tumors indicating a potential role in breast
tumorigenesis [9].
DDX3 is a multifunctional protein that belongs
to the aspartate-glutamate-alanine-aspartate (D-EA-D) box RNA helicase family [10, 11]. The putative
functions of DDX3 have been associated with a variety
of cellular functions, including cell-cycle arrest, cellular
proliferation, and apoptosis under various conditions
[12–14]. It has also been demonstrated that DDX3 gene
mutations are associated with medulloblastoma [15].
Recent evidence indicates that DDX3 interacts with
hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein to maintain both
genomic-length HCV RNA and its replicon RNA and
that DDX3 is required for HCV virus replication [16,
17]. Evidence also demonstrates that DDX3 is required
for the export of unspliced/partially spliced HIV-1
RNAs from the nucleus  to the cytoplasm [18] and
facilitates translation of HIV-1 mRNAs [19]. It has been
reported that knockdown of DDX3 suppressed HIV-1
replication [18, 20]. Based on the findings of DDX3′s
involvement in HIV, Venkat and colleagues, in pursuit of
anti-HIV agents, reported two ring-expanded nucleosides
(RENs), one of which is NZ51, as DDX3 inhibitors and
demonstrated REN’s mode of action as an inhibition of
the unwinding activity of DDX3 helicase [21]. RENs
mimic the natural 5:6-fused purine nucleoside analogs
with a 5:7-fused imidazodiazepine ring system. Recently,
a series of tricyclic 5:7:5-fused heterocyclic analogs,
which contain the 5:7-fused skeleton, were structurally
designed to target DDX3 for anti-cancer activity [22–
24]. An additional series of DDX3 inhibitors have been
reported, which were found through a high throughput
screening study of compound libraries [25–28].
Given the current interest in DDX3 functions in
cancer biogenesis, we investigated the utility of NZ51 as a
potential anti-cancer drug [21]. NZ51 contains a 5:7-fused
imidazodiazepine ring system with a C18 alkyl chain
tail. We demonstrated that NZ51 treatment decreased
DDX3 activity, suppressed cell cycle, inhibited breast
cancer cell proliferation, and reduced breast cancer cell
motility. However, NZ51 treatment had little effect on
primary tumor growth rates in a mouse model system.
Investigation is ongoing to determine the possible causes
of NZ51 inactivity in animal models.

Knockdown of DDX3 decreases cell proliferation
and clonogenicity in MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cells
To evaluate the function of DDX3 expression in
cancer cell proliferation, DDX3 was knocked down
in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines
with a lentiviral shDDX3 construct. As shown in
Figure  1A–1B, MDA-MB-231 had relatively high
levels of endogenous DDX3 and the corresponding
shDDX3 treatment knocked down DDX3 in MDAMB-231 cells to an estimated 50–60% at both the
mRNA and protein level. A subsequent study indicated
that the growth rate of MDA-MB-231-shDDX3
cells was slower, compared to control (Figure 1C).
In order to check the effect of DDX3 knockdown
on clonogenic ability, MDA-MB-231-shDDX3 and
MCF-7-shDDX3 cell lines along with control cell
lines were cultured for 1–2 weeks. We observed that
DDX3 knockdown caused over 90% decrease in
colony forming ability for MDA-MB-231 cells and
a 40% decrease for MCF-7 cells (Figure  1D–1E).
These results are an indication that DDX3 has important
functions during breast cancer cell growth and
proliferation.

Knockdown of DDX3 in MDA-MB-231 cells
decreases metastasis in a preclinical breast
cancer model
To biologically characterize the role of DDX3 in
breast cancer biogenesis, we generated xenografts in
female SCID mice using MDA-MB-231-shDDX3 or
MDA-MB-231-shLuc cells. As shown in Figure 2A,
the tumor growth rate for MDA-MB-231-shDDX3
(60% decrease in DDX3 transcript), as anticipated from
the in vitro study (Figure 1D), was initially slower than
that of MDA-MB-231-shLuc during the first 6 weeks
of the study. After 6 weeks of growth, the growth rate
of  the MDA-MB-231-shDDX3 derived tumors was
similar to MDA-MB-231-shLuc derived tumors. To
validate the potential differential metastatic properties
of these tumors (Figure 2B), animals were euthanized
when tumor volumes reached approximately 250
mm3. Autopsies revealed that animals inoculated
with MDA-MB-231-shLuc cells had, on average, 17
metastatic foci in the lungs while mice that received
MDA-MB-231-shDDX3 cells (Figure 2B) had fewer
metastatic lesions. This indicates that lowering DDX3
expression abrogates metastatic progression under
these conditions.

DDX3 knockdown effect on tumor vascular
permeability and vascular volume

Molecular modeling of interactions of NZ51 with
DDX3

As tumors generated from DDX3 knockdown
cells exhibited reduced metastatic load, we wanted to
determine whether there were any alterations to the
tumor microenvironment. To characterize these changes,
a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was carried
out to visualize tumor vasculature, vascular volume (VV)
and permeability-surface area products (PS) (Figure 2C).
A comparison of the permeability-surface area products
and vascular volume of tumors generated using MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-231-shDDX3 cells (Figure 2C),
indicated no significant differences in these parameters
in our model. This indicated that DDX3 expression may
not be the primary driver of vascularization in these
tumors and the reduced metastatic load could be due to
altered cellular changes induced by decreased DDX3
expression.

To understand the inhibition activity of NZ51
on DDX3, as demonstrated in a previous study [21],
using the Autodock Vina molecular modeling program,
we generated an energy-minimized NZ51-DDX3
interaction model with binding energy of −6 to −6.5
Kcal/mol using an open crystal structure of DDX3
(PDB ID: 2I4I) [29]. The docking results indicated that
NZ51 (Figure 3A) fits into the ATP binding site with
its lipophilic octadecyl tail (blue) close to lipophilic
amino acid residues including Ile 522, Val 526 and
Leu 559 (within 4 angstrom) (Figure 3B). The hydrogen
binding interactions between NZ51 main skeleton and
polar amino acid residues in the binding pocket include
interactions of HOH 685 with both N-H at position 6
of NZ51 (2.4 Å) and N-H at position 7 of NZ51
(3.2 Å), HOH 683 with N-H at position 6 (2.2 Å), N-H

of NZ51 (2.8 Å), Gly 229 C=O (3.5 Å) and Glu 285
side chain C=O (3.7 Å). Also, the aerial view indicates
that the imidazole-diazepine ring system can be stacked
with phenol ring of Tyr 200 to enhance tighter binding
(Figure 3C). In conclusion, the modeling study indicates
that thermodynamically favorable, hydrophobic and
hydrophilic interactions between NZ51 and the amino
acid residues of the ATP binding site of DDX3 can occur
and thus, such a favorable binding of NZ51 at this site
may explain the inhibition of ATP-dependent helicase
activity of DDX3.

To study the effects of NZ51 on cell growth and
proliferation, non-tumorigenic immortalized breast
cells (MCF 10A and MCF 12A) and breast cancer cells
(MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231) were used.
Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that DDX3 protein
expression levels directly correlates to the tumorigenicity
and aggressiveness of breast cancer cell lines [9]. To
investigate the cell growth inhibitory activity of NZ51 on
these various breast cancer cell lines, cell viability assays
were performed following treatment with increasing
concentrations of NZ51. The results showed that the
viabilities of non-tumorigenic immortalized cell lines with
very low DDX3 expression, MCF 10A and MCF 12A, were
unaffected at all NZ51 concentrations tested (Figure 4A).
However,  NZ51 inhibited  cell  proliferation of MCF-7,
MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells with IC50 values

indicated that the possible inhibition of DDX3 activity by
NZ51 in breast cancer cells resulted in growth inhibition.

(Figure 4B). Day 3 mirrored the results seen at day 2 for
MCF-7 cells but the degree of change in cells entering
G2/M was much smaller. Thus, NZ51 treatment of
MCF-7 cells had its most effective impact on the cell
cycle during day 1 where 8 and 12 μM concentrations
of NZ51 caused an accumulation of cells in G1 arrest
and a loss of cells in S phases. For MDA-MB-231
cells, treatment with 12  μM NZ51 had the largest
impact by day 3 at which time most of the cells were
arrested in G1 phase and the least were in S and G2/M
phases (Figure 4C). In general, these results indicated
that treatment of these breast cancer cell lines with
12  μM of NZ51 had a differential effect on the cell
cycle after day 1. The comparatively more aggressive
MDA-MB-231 cell line was more profoundly affected
at later time points. This might be a reflection of its
relatively higher expression of DDX3 in MDA-MB-231
cells compared to MCF-7 cells.

NZ51 treatment causes cell arrest at G1 phase
To determine whether NZ51′s inhibition was
related to arrest of the cell cycle, flow cytometry was
used to quantitate the cell cycle phase percentage
distributions following treatment with different
concentrations of NZ51. As shown in Figure 4B, at day
1, treating MCF-7 cells with increasing concentrations
of NZ51 resulted in an increase in the percentage of
cells in G1 phase with proportional decreases in the
percentage of cells in S and G2/M phases. By day 2,
increasing NZ51 concentration had less of an effect on
the percentage of MCF-7 cells in G1 or S phases but
did lower the percentage of cells entering G2/M phase

action of NZ51. Based on the molecular modeling profile,
NZ51 binds the nucleoside-binding site of DDX3. This
could lead to either the destabilization/degradation of DDX3
or abrogation of its functional activity. Towards determining
the action of NZ51, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were
incubated with 5 μM and 10 μM of NZ51 respectively for
different time intervals (12, 24, 48 and 72 hr). Following
incubation, total proteins were extracted and scored on
immunoblots for DDX3 levels. As shown in Figure 6A,
DDX3 levels were higher in treated cells (as early as 12 hr)
than the DMSO controls. This appears to indicate that the
binding of NZ51 to DDX3 results in a decreased turnover of
DDX3 protein. As reported earlier, over expression of DDX3
in MCF 10A cells decreased expression of E-cadherin levels
[9]. To confirm if the resulting DDX3-NZ51 complex
was functionally active, we scored for E-cadherin levels,
a down-stream target of DDX3 [9]. As demonstrated
in Figure 6A, E-cadherin levels remained constant,
indicating the DDX3-NZ51 complex was not functionally
active. In addition, functional E-cadherin promoter-reporter
assays supported our initial findings that the elevated DDX3
levels in the NZ51 treated MCF-7 cells were not functionally
active (Figure 6C). Taken together, these results indicate
that binding of NZ51 to DDX3, although reducing DDX3

To further examine how NZ51 treatment inhibited
cell proliferation along with cell motility, “woundhealing” assays were performed. The results indicated that
DMSO treated MCF-7 cells nearly completely filled the
“wound” by 60 hr (Figure 5). In stark contrast, treatment 
of MCF-7 cells with NZ51 greatly hindered the motility/
proliferation of these cells and 20–30% of the wound
remained unfilled at 60 h (Figure  5). Similar results
were observed in the NZ51 treated MDA-MB-231 cells
versus DMSO treated cells (Figure 5) and again motility/
proliferation was hindered as can be seen at the 60 h time
point where 40–50% of the “wound” remains unresolved
(Figure 5). These results are a further indication that NZ51
treatment of breast cancer cell lines impairs their ability to
proliferate as well as hindering their motility.

Cellular effects of NZ51 on breast cancer

cancer cell lines, we investigated the possible mechanism of

added to the cells at 10 μM and incubated for 72 hr. As
shown in Figure 6B & 6D, NZ51 was able to decrease the
viable cell fraction by approximately 50%, indicating that
NZ51 retains its activity under both normoxic and hypoxic
conditions, thus making it an excellent drug candidate for
breast cancer treatment.

Effect of hypoxia on the functional activity of
NZ51 to induce cell death
During solid tumor biogenesis, regions of hypoxia
develop within the tumor due to inadequate and poorly
formed vasculature. These regions have been shown to
be resistant to chemotherapy and radiation and have also
been closely linked to malignant progression [30, 31]. To
evaluate the efficacy of NZ51 to induce cell death under
hypoxic conditions, MDA-MB-231 cells engineered to
express a hypoxia induced fluorescent protein (tdTomato)
were used (Figure 6B) [32]. Following confirmation of

HIV-1′s replication cycle [18]. Our molecular modeling
studies of a DDX3 interaction with NZ51 showed that
NZ51 can be incorporated into the DDX3 ATP binding
region with multiple favorable hydrogen and hydrophobic
bonding interactions which supported the hypothesis that
NZ51 can directly interact with DDX3 and inhibit its
activity by blocking or displacing ATP and thus arrogate
DDX3 unwinding helicase function.
Given our initial finding that DDX3 participates
in cellular transformation, proliferation, motility, tumor
growth rate, and metastatic progression, we explored
NZ51 as a potential inhibitor of DDX3. We found that
NZ51 inhibited cell growth of breast cancer cell lines
with high DDX3 expression (MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and
MDA-MB-231) but not against two non-cancerous breast
cell lines (MCF 10A and MCF 12A) with low DDX3
expression. We further evaluated the effects of NZ51 on the
cell cycle, which indicated that NZ51 mediated an increase
in the percentage of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells in
G1 phase and the accumulation was directly correlated
to the NZ51concentration. However, for MCF-7 cells
this phenomenon was only confirmed at day 1 of NZ51
treatment and there were no significant changes at day 2
or day 3 after treatment. This could be due to less effective
drug concentration caused by NZ51 metabolism and/or
sequestration into a subcellular compartment. In further
support for the utility of NZ51, a wound-healing assay
demonstrated that NZ51 decreased the cell migration of
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5). At the cellular
level, NZ51 may be stabilizing DDX3 protein levels, i.e.,
slow its turnover rate, while abolishing its function as
determined by an E-cadherin reporter assays. This could
be due to altered protein confirmation in the presence of
NZ51 that abrogates DDX3′s normal interactions with
cellular macromolecules, thereby blocking its degradation
and inactivating its functions. Under these same conditions
no change in E-cadherin or actin levels was seen, which
points to the fact that NZ51 is not likely a general inhibitor
of cellular protein degradation processes.
As is customary with any chemotherapeutic agent,
it is advantageous to demonstrate if the drug will be active
in a tumor’s hypoxic pockets since hypoxic regions are
well known to contribute to radiation and chemotherapy
resistance as well as metastatic progression. Thus, drugs
that are effective in killing hypoxic tumor cells greatly aid
in eradicating the cancer. Our results demonstrated that
NZ51 is active in both normoxic and hypoxic environments,
which indicate that NZ51 can kill breast cancer cells
regardless of the oxygenation status of the cells.
As the data from the present studies indicated that
NZ51 could be a very promising candidate for anticancer
drug development, we investigated the antitumor activity
in vivo to confirm whether NZ51 can reduce the tumor
volume in a mouse model. However, our in vivo mouse
model drug therapy experiment showed that NZ51 treated

tumor volumes after injection of DMSO and NZ51 into
MDA-MB-231 inoculated athymic nu/nu mice were
performed (Supplementary Figure 1). However there was
no significant difference in tumor growth rates between
control and NZ51 treated mice. This could be due to
several factors including lack of efficient drug delivery,
rapid clearance, and drug degradation.

DISCUSSION
Recently, our laboratory reported that DDX3 could
have important cellular functions that participate in or
even drive breast cancer carcinogenesis [9]. Our data
also demonstrated that DDX3 expression levels can be
directly correlated with the invasiveness of patient breast
cancer samples [9]. We also demonstrated that stable
over-expression of DDX3 in MCF 10A cells induced
an EMT and promoted aggressive properties such as
increased motility and invasion as well as the ability to
form colonies in soft agar, all of which are characteristic
features of cellular transformation.
The present work provides corroborating evidence
that DDX3 is required for cancer cell proliferation both
in vitro and in vivo and targeting DDX3 with a small
molecule inhibitor, NZ51, could be a viable option
for breast cancer treatment. As a first step towards
determining the biological functions of DDX3, we
knocked down DDX3 mRNA and protein levels in both
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. The obtained data
showed that the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231shDDX3 cells was significantly reduced. Additionally,
knockdown of DDX3 decreased the clonogenicity of
both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, an
orthotopic xenograft mouse model was used to assess the
effect of DDX3 knockdown on the in vivo growth rate and
metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231-shDDX3 versus
MDA-MB-231 tumors. This study was further supported
by the clonogenicity data indicating that DDX3 expression
levels could be an important marker that is associated with
tumor growth rate. Most importantly, the decreased DDX3
protein expression levels of MDA-MB-231-shDDX3
tumors resulted in reduced metastatic lesions to the lungs
indicating a possible function of DDX3 during metastatic
progression. Interestingly, decreased DDX3 expression
levels in MDA-MB-231-shDDX3 cells did not change the
tumor vascular volume or the permeability-surface area
product indicating that there is little or no role of DDX3
in promoting angiogenesis during tumor growth and
progression in the model system used [33, 34].
A small molecule inhibitor of DDX3, referred to as
NZ51, was initially investigated as an anti-HIV-1 agent
targeting DDX3. The rationale for this targeted approach
was based on the finding that DDX3 was necessary for the
transporting of unspliced or partially spliced HIV-1 virus
mRNA from the nucleus to cytoplasm and thus vital to

mice developed tumors with sizes comparable to those of
untreated animals. Considering the chemical structure of
NZ51, it is possible that the water insolubility may hinder
its distribution in vivo and development of a drug delivery
system such as PLGA nanoparticles may overcome this
problem.
In conclusion, the evidence from this study
indicates that NZ51 shows excellent in vitro inhibition
of proliferation rates of cancer cells expressing relatively
high levels of DDX3. However, further experiments will
have to be carried out to determine its efficacy in animals.

resuspended in DNA staining solution (5 μg/ml propidium
iodide, 0.5 mg/ml RNase A) for 1 h at room temperature.
Cell cycle acquisition was performed on a FACScan I or
FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Independent triplicate experiments were performed. Data
was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.,
Ashland, OR).

Colony-formation assays
MCF-7, MCF-7-shDDX3, MDA-MB-231, and
MDA-MB231-shDDX3 cells were seeded at a density
of 200 cells/well in 6 well plates in 2 mL of medium.
Following incubation for 2 weeks, the colonies were
stained with 0.5% crystal violet and counted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
MCF-7 cells were maintained in modified Eagle’s
medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS). MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Roswell
Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI-1640) containing
10% FBS. MCF 10A and MCF 12A cells were cultured
in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
and F12 medium (DMEM/F12 50/50) supplemented with
5% horse serum, hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), insulin
(10 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), penicillin
(100 I.U./ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). MDAMB-468 cells were cultured in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium
with 10% FBS. All medium are from Cellgro, Herndon,
VA, USA. All cell lines were obtained from ATCC and
cultured under standard sterile cell culture conditions in a
humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.

Wound-healing assay
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in
6-well plates until about 70–80% confluency was reached
at which point a 10 μL pipette tip was used to create a
scratch/wound with clear edges across the width of a well.
Wells were treated either with vehicle control (DMSO)
or 10 μM NZ51 and photomicrographs were taken over a
60 h time period. A Nikon TS100 inverted microscope was
used to measure and photograph the cell migration from
the wound/scratch edge every 12 hr. All experiments were
performed in triplicates.

DDX3 knockdown by shRNA
DDX3 shRNA lentiviral constructs have been
described previously [9]. Briefly, the construct has a U6
promoter driving DDX3 shRNA and a PGK promoter
driving EGFP. The control was a shLuc lentiviral vector.
Stable shLuc and shDDX3 clones were generated in
MCF-7 (MCF-7-shDDX3 and MCF-7-shLuc) and MDAMB-231 (MDA-MB-231-shDDX3 and MDA-MB-231shLuc) cell lines using lentivirus transduction.

Cell proliferation assay
MCF 10A, MCF 12A, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and
MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured at a density of 1 × 103
cells per well in flat-bottomed 96-well plates. After 72 h
of treatment with NZ51 at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10 and
20 μM, MTS solution was added to each well, cells were
incubated for an additional 2 h and the cell viability was
determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm
using a Victor3 V1420 multiplate counter (Perkin Elmer,
Waltham, MA). MDA-MB-231 cells (parental, control and
shDDX3) were plated at 1 × 105 cells per well in 6-well
plates and allowed to grow for 4 days. MTS assays were
performed after 1, 2, 3 and 4 days of growth.

Immunoblotting
Following treatment of NZ51, cells were washed
with PBS, trypsinized and harvested for protein expression
analysis. Standard SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting
protocols were followed throughout. The primary
antibodies used were monoclonal antibodies against
DDX3, actin and E-cadherin. The secondary antibody
used was anti-mouse-HRP antibody and visualized using
Chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

Flow cytometry analysis
MCF-7 (5 × 104 cells per well) and MDA-MB-231
cells (1 × 105 cells per well) were plated in 6-well plates

Molecular modeling

was detailed in our earlier reports [33, 34], except that
we used 250, 500, and 1,000 ms for relaxation delays.
Three-dimensional angiograms were acquired using a
gradient-echo sequence with the following parameters:
echo time = 2.5 ms, repetition time = 8 ms, number of
averages = 4, and matrix size = 256 × 128 × 64. Data
were analyzed with in-house software written in the IDL
programming environment (Exelis Visual Information
Solution, Inc., Boulder, CO) and 3D images were visualized
with the Amira graphic package (Visage Imaging Inc., San
Diego, CA).

The Autodock Vina program was used to perform
the molecular modeling. The crystal structure of DDX3
(in the open confirmation) was obtained from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB ID: 2I4I) [29]. NZ51, was docked into the
nucleoside-binding site. The grid box of the ATP-binding
site was generated according to the position of AMP within
its confirmed binding site. Autodock uses a scoring function
based on amber force field, which estimates the lowest free
energy of binding of a ligand (NZ51) to its target (DDX3).

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction

NZ51 treatment efficacy
Athymic NCr-nu/nu mice 4–5 weeks old were
purchased from NCI Fredrick. The mice were anesthetized
using 2.5% isoflurane and one million MDA-MB-231
cells were injected in the second thoracic fat pad using
an insulin syringe. Mice were randomly grouped into
two groups. Treatment started 18 days after tumor cell
inoculation with daily DMSO (vehicle control) or NZ51
(80 mg/kg) intraperitoneal injections for 18 days. Tumor
dimensions were measured weekly with a digital caliper
and volumes calculated using the formula: V = (ab2)/2
[36]. Mice were sacrificed when the longest tumor
diameter reached 10 mm.

RNA from breast cancer cells was extracted according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
and cDNA was generated with qScript cDNA synthesis kit
(Quanta BioSciences, Gaithersburg, MD), followed by qPCR
using SYBR green (Quanta BioSciences, Gaithersburg, MD)
on an iCycler5 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Amplification of
36B4, a housekeeping gene, was used for normalizing gene
expression values.

Orthotopic xenograft models
All animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with guidelines from the Johns Hopkins
Animal Care and Use Committee; mice were maintained
under pathogen-free conditions and given food and water
ad libitum.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed a minimum
of three times. Linear regression analysis was used
to compute the concentration of test agent needed
to reduce mitochondrial activity by 50%, termed the
midpoint cytotoxicity. Unpaired, t-test was performed
for flow cytometric analysis. P-values ≤  0.05%
were considered significant. VV and PS values were
compared between MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231shDDX3 xenografts using nonparametric Mann-Whitney
U test.

Evaluation of DDX3-knockdown on metastatic
progression
One million of MDA-MB-231-shLuc and MDAMB-231 shDDX3 cells were inoculated in the second left
thoracic mammary fat pad of 4–6 weeks old female SCID
mice. Mice were monitored weekly and tumor volumes
were measured and evaluated by formula: V = (ab2)/2 [36].
Lung metastases were stained using H&E staining of lung
sections.
