Abstract
The stress-inducible chaperone protein HSP70 (HSPA1) is
implicated in melanoma development, and HSP70 inhibitors
exert tumor-speciﬁc cytotoxic activity in cancer. In this study, we
documented that a signiﬁcant proportion of melanoma tumors
express high levels of HSP70, particularly at advanced stages, and
that phospho-FAK (PTK2) and BRAF are HSP70 client proteins.
Treatment of melanoma cells with HSP70 inhibitors decreased
levels of phospho-FAK along with impaired migration, invasion,

and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the HSP70 inhibitor
PET-16 reduced levels of mutant BRAF, synergized with the BRAF
inhibitor PLX4032 in vitro, and enhanced the durability of
response to BRAF inhibition in vivo. Collectively, these ﬁndings
provide strong support for HSP70 inhibition as a therapeutic
strategy in melanoma, especially as an adjuvant approach for
overcoming the resistance to BRAF inhibitors frequently observed
in melanoma patients. Cancer Res; 76(9); 2720–30. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

referred to as HSP70) might provide a novel therapeutic avenue,
both alone and in combination with current therapies.
The HSP70 family has over 10 members, many of which show
tissue-speciﬁc expression and/or organelle-speciﬁc localization
(2, 3). In contrast with constitutively expressed forms like HSPA5
(Bip, GRP78), HSPA8 (HSC70), and HSPA9 (GRP75), all of
which are required for cell viability, the major stress-induced
form, HSP70, is expressed at extremely low levels in unstressed
cells and is not required for life (4). Consequently, HSP70
inhibitors show tumor-selective cytotoxicity, with limited toxicity
in normal, nontransformed cells (5). We have developed and
characterized a series of HSP70 inhibitors, beginning with the
"ﬁrst-in-class" compound, PES (2-Phenylethynesulfonamide,
empirical formula C8H7NO2S, molecular weight 181.2). PES
binds speciﬁcally to the lesser-conserved substrate-binding
domain (SBD) of HSP70, and it does not bind to family members
like BiP and GRP75, or to the chaperone HSP90 (6). We found
that PES is broadly cytotoxic to cancer but not normal cells, and it
markedly protects Em-myc mice from lymphoma, without any
evidence of organ or general toxicity (6). Subsequently, we have
developed and characterized two derivatives of PES, called PES-Cl
and PET-16, which show superior cytotoxicity and enhanced
efﬁcacy as anticancer agents, both in vitro and in vivo (7–9). The
chemical structures of PES, PES-Cl, and PET-16 are depicted
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Notably, silencing or deletion of HSP70
(HSPA1A/A1B) in tumor cells reduces the cytotoxicity of these
compounds, supporting the premise that they are speciﬁc for
HSP70 and are not other family members (6, 9). Mechanistically,
these compounds are cytotoxic by virtue of their ability to inhibit
proteasome function, alter the solubility and proper folding of
HSP70 client proteins, and via their ability to inhibit autophagy, a
cancer-critical survival pathway (6–8, 10). We elucidated the

Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive and usually fatal malignancy. Advanced melanomas have multiple oncogenic drivers,
and despite advances with BRAF and immune checkpoint inhibitors, resistance to therapy is a signiﬁcant problem (1). Given the
incomplete efﬁcacy and durability of current treatment options,
and the enormous propensity of melanomas for resistance, there
is an urgent need to identify new molecular targets for melanoma.
In this work, we test the hypothesis that the major stress-inducible
heat shock protein 70 (also called HSP72 or HSPA1A but hereafter

A Novel HSP70 Inhibitor for Treatment of Melanoma

mechanism of action of PES, PES-Cl, and PET-16 using a combination of isothermal calorimetry and by solving the crystal
structure of PET-16 bound to the SBD of the closely related
bacterial orthologue of HSP70, DnaK. These analyses revealed
that PET-16 interacts with loop alpha-beta of the SBD and functions as an allosteric regulator to prevent allosteric cycling of
HSP70 (9). The speciﬁcity of PES derivatives for HSP70, and their
efﬁcacy on tumor lines in vitro, provided us a unique opportunity
to study the role of this chaperone in melanoma.
In this work, we conducted the ﬁrst tumor microarray of
melanoma for HSP70, using an antibody speciﬁc for the major
stress-induced form that does not cross-react with other isoforms
(11). We show that HSP70 is highly expressed in a large percentage of melanomas, and that expression of this protein increases
with advanced stage. We use the technique of reverse phase
protein array (RPPA) in melanomas to identify HSP70 client
proteins, and identify pFAK and BRAF as two melanoma-relevant
and speciﬁc client proteins of HSP70. We show that inhibition of
pFAK using the HSP70 inhibitor PET-16 leads to decreased ability
of melanomas to migrate, invade, and metastasize in vivo. In
addition, we show that the V600E mutant form of BRAF, present
in up to 50% of melanoma tumors, is a client of HSP70. Along
these lines, we show that PET-16 synergizes with BRAF inhibitors,
retains cytotoxicity in melanomas resistant to BRAF inhibitors,
and extends the durability of treatment with BRAF inhibitors.
These combined data augur well for the eventual use of HSP70
inhibitors for melanoma therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, treatments, and reagents
All human melanoma cell lines were obtained from the Wistar
Institute collection and were conﬁrmed by genotyping. These cells
were maintained in MCDB153 (Sigma)/Leibovitz's L-15 (Cellgro)
medium (4:1 ratio) supplemented with 2% FCS and 2 mmol/L
CaCl2. H1299 cells, B16-F10, and ﬁbroblasts were obtained from
the ATCC within 6 months of their use, and were maintained in
DMEM (Invitrogen). The FS5 cell line, kindly provided by Ashani
Weeraratna (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA), was maintained in
RPMI 1640, and the Yumm1.7 cell line (kindly provided by Marcus
Bosenburg, Yale University, New Haven, CT) was maintained in
DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen). All the above media were supplemented
with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin. Cell stocks were ﬁngerprinted using AmpFLSTR Identiﬁler
PCR Ampliﬁcation Kit from Life Technologies at The Wistar
Institute Genomics Facility. PET-16 (Triphenyl(phenylethynyl)
phosphonium bromide; Sigma; catalog #S16773) and vemurafenib/PLX4032 (S1267; Selleckchem) were prepared as 50 mmol/L
stock solutions in DMSO and stored at -80 C.
Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and shRNA
Western blotting was performed as described (7). Primary
antibodies used in this study include HSP70 (4873S; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-HA (3724; Cell Signaling Technology),
total FAK (EMD Millipore; 05-537), FAK Tyr-397-P (44-625G;
Invitrogen), BRAF (sc-5284; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and
GAPDH (14C10; Cell Signaling Technology; 2118). Secondary
antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used at a
dilution of 1:10,000 (Jackson Immunochemicals). ECL (Amersham; RPN2232) was applied to blots, and protein levels were
detected using autoradiography. Densitometry quantiﬁcation of

protein signals was performed using ImageJ software (NIH). For
IP westerns, 1,000 mg of lysate was immunoprecipitated as
described (12) with 0.5 mg of antisera to HSP70, followed by
SDS-PAGE, transfer, and Western analysis using antisera to total
FAK, FAK Tyr-397-P, and BRAF. The 1205Lu cell line with shRNA
knockdown of PTK2/FAK was generated by infection with the
lentiviral vector pLKO.1-puro carrying either of two shRNA
sequences against human PTK2: shRNA (CCGGTCGAATGATAAGGTGTA; TRCN0000001620 and CAACAGGTGAAGAGCGATTAT; TRCN0000194984). Stable cells were selected using
puromycin (1 mg/mL), and PTK2/FAK knockdown was conﬁrmed
by Western blot.
Cell viability assays and drug synergy testing
Human melanoma cells were plated at 2,000 cells per well in
96-well plates. After 24 hours, cells were treated with serial
dilutions of individual drugs or combinations of two drugs at
a constant molar ratio. After 72 hours, cell viability was measured
with Alamar blue (Life Technologies; DAL1025) using a SynergyHT plate reader (BioTek). Combination index (CI) values,
established by the Chou–Talalay method (13), were calculated
using the CompuSyn software package (CompuSyn). BRAF inhibitor–resistant cells were generated by growing parental cells in the
presence of 1 mmol/L, 5 mmol/L, or 10 mmol/L PLX4720 for at least
four passages. Resistance was conﬁrmed by IC50 analysis.
Immunoﬂuorescence, immunohistochemistry, and tumor
tissue microarray
Immunoﬂuorescence of ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections was performed as previously described (14). The following
primary antibodies were used: FAK Tyr-397-P (44-625G; Invitrogen), FAK Tyr-397-P (700255; Life Technologies), SQSTM1/p62
(ab56416; Abcam), and SQSTM1/p62 (sc-28359; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 0.9-mm
cores of 77 nevi, 8 in-situ, 50 invasive, and 103 metastatic malignant melanomas constructed at the Fox Chase Cancer Center
(Philadelphia, PA); full details about these samples are previously
described (15). Paired melanoma tissue specimens before and
after vemurafenib treatment were obtained at the Abramson
Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA. All samples were procured under
approved Institutional Review Board protocols at the relevant
institution. The HSP70 monoclonal antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology; 4873S) is speciﬁc for the major stress-induced
form of HSP70, and does not cross-react with other family
members (11). This was incubated with the tissue after heatinduced epitope retrieval with citrate buffer (pH 6.0). The samples
were incubated with primary antibody overnight followed by
incubation with a biotinylated secondary antibody (Jackson
Immuno Research; 1:200) for 30 minutes. Detection was performed using Nova Red for 15 minutes, and the slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin (Fisher Scientiﬁc). Immunohistochemical stain for HSP70 was interpreted semiquantitatively by
assessing the intensity and extent of staining on the tissue sections
present on the slides according using the H-Score method as
previously described (16). HSP70 expression was scored in
blinded manner by a board-certiﬁed dermatopathologist (Xiaowei Xu, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA).
Organotypic three-dimensional skin reconstructs
Human skin reconstructs were generated as previously
described (17). Brieﬂy, dermal reconstructs consisted of rat tail

type I collagen contracted for 4 days with embedded dermal
ﬁbroblasts (7.5  104 per dish) before seeding 1205Lu cells
(0.83  105) together with keratinocytes (4.17  105) on top of
the dermal reconstructs over a 4-day period in media before air
exposure until day 18 to allow epidermal differentiation. During
the last 7 days, skin reconstructs were treated with DMSO or
PET-16 that were added to the medium. At day 18, skin reconstructs were harvested and ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
for 2 to 3 hours, embedded into parafﬁn, sectioned (5 mm), and
then stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
RPPA
Triplicate samples of WM793 and 1205Lu cells were treated
with vehicle, 1 mmol/L, 3 mmol/L, 5 mmol/L, and 10 mmol/L PET16 for 24 hours. Following standard protocols of the RPPA Core
Facility at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), cells were
lysed on ice, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation and
denatured in SDS sample buffer, and then submitted for analysis
as described (18, 19). The pair-wise group comparisons were done
using two-sample t test, and the Benjamini–Hochberg method
was used for correction for multiple testing. Proteins that for a
PET-16 concentration passed FDR < 5% in both cell lines, and fold
change > 1.2 threshold in at least one cell line were considered
signiﬁcantly differentially expressed. Data were visualized as
expression heatmaps using Microsoft Excel.
Wound healing, invasion, and Transwell migration assay
For wound-healing assays, melanoma cells were seeded in 24well plates and grown to 90% to 95% conﬂuency. Subsequently, a
scratch was placed in the middle of the well with a sterile 200 mL
pipette tip. After washing once with serum-free media, the respective treatments were performed. Media with DMSO were added to
control wells, and media with different drugs were added to
respective wells before starting the time-lapse imaging. The concentrations of drug used were shown not to induce cell death using
live/dead staining (Calcein/PI; Sigma Aldrich). Images were captured every 15 minutes for 72 hours. Each reading was performed
in triplicate. For Transwell migration assays, 6-well Transwell
assay dishes (3414; Corning Life Sciences) were used to examine
the migration of melanoma cells. 1205Lu cells were pretreated
with PET-16 for 24 hours, and then seeded onto the ﬁlters in
serum-free media at 20  104 cells/well. Media containing 20%
FCS were placed in the lower well to act as a chemoattractant.
Following a 24-hour incubation period at 37 C, the inserts were
removed and washed three times in PBS. Cells remaining on the
upper surface of the insert (nonmigrated cells) were removed
gently using a cotton swab, and cells on the lower surface were
stained with the Differential Quick Stain Kit (24606-250; Polysciences, Inc.). After staining, inserts were rinsed three times by
dipping into PBS and left to air-dry. Colored cells that had
migrated through the pores of the polycarbonate membrane were
visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope.
Experimental lung metastasis, allograft and xenograft
models
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed in an
Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care–accredited facility. B16-F10 cells were pretreated
with DMSO, 3 mmol/L PES-CL, or 3 mmol/L PET-16 for 24 hours

2722 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

and were injected (2.5  105 cells/100 mL PBS) into the tail vein of
C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory). At day 7, weekly intraperitoneal injections with DMSO vehicle, 20 mg/kg PES-CL, or
5mg/kg PET-16 were initiated in randomly assigned groups of 10
mice for each treatment arm (n ¼ 10). After 3 weeks, the mice were
euthanized, the lungs were harvested, photographed, and embedded in parafﬁn for further immunohistochemical analysis. For the
allograft model, 1  106 of pooled, transfected Yumm1.7 mouse
melanoma cells engineered to express high level of HSP70 versus a
parental cell line were subcutaneously injected into the right ﬂank
of C57Bl/6 mice. For the next 20 days, tumor burden was
monitored twice a week by volume calculation using caliper
measurements. For the xenograft model, 5  105 of 1205Lu
human melanoma cells were subcutaneously injected into the
right ﬂank of female NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice
at a Matrigel/culture medium ratio of 1:1. When tumors reached
an average tumor volume of approximately 120 to 200 mm3,
animals were randomized into treatment groups. Mice were
treated with (i) PET-16 (5 mg/kg per i.p. injection twice a week,
n ¼ 10), (ii) vemurafenib/PLX4720 (200 mg/kg of PLX-containing chow, n ¼ 10), (iii) vemurafenib/PLX4720 (200 mg/kg of
PLX-containing chow) plus 5 mg/kg PET-16 (n ¼ 10), and (iv)
with PET-16 (10 mg/kg per i.p. injection twice a week, n ¼ 5).
Buffered saline (n ¼ 10) and normal chow served as vehicle
controls. Tumor growth was measured every 3 to 4 days using
calipers; tumor volumes were calculated according to the formula
V ¼ (L x W x W)/2 (mm3), where V is tumor volume, L is tumor
length, and W is tumor width. At day 27, the study was completed,
and the tumors were harvested and embedded in parafﬁn for
further immunohistochemical analysis.
Statistical analysis of data
For in vitro studies, the Student t test was performed using at
least three independent experiments. For animal experiments,
tumor weight was compared using t test between two groups. The
effect of treatment on the change of tumor volume was examined
using mixed model analysis. For TMA scores from human tissues,
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare TMA scores
between melanoma and nevi. Cuzik's trend test was used to
examine the trend of TMA scores from the tissues without melanoma to tissues with different stage of melanoma. Paired t test
was used to compare TMA scores between before and after
therapy. A P value < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Results
HSP70 is markedly overexpressed in metastatic melanoma
There are some reports that show that HSP70 (HSPA1A/B) is
overexpressed in melanoma, and may be associated with drugresistant melanoma (20–22). However to date, no studies have
performed a comprehensive staining for the major, heat shock
inducible form of HSP70 protein in melanoma tumors versus
benign nevi. Toward this end, we used an HSP70 monoclonal
antibody speciﬁc for the cytosolic stress-induced form of this
protein, and not cross-react with other family members, in order
to stain a TMA composed of 77 nevi, 8 melanoma in situ, 50
invasive primary melanomas, and 103 metastatic melanomas.
There was a statistically signiﬁcant difference in HSP70 staining in
melanomas compared with nevi (mean  SD score melanoma vs.
nevi P ¼ 0.0003; Fig. 1A–C). In addition, there was a signiﬁcant
correlation between HSP70 expression and increasing stage of

A Novel HSP70 Inhibitor for Treatment of Melanoma

cancer, and the highest median scores for HSP70 were in metastatic melanoma (Cuzik's trend test, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1D).
We next determined whether HSP70 mRNA levels correlated
with patient survival using the program PrognoScan, which
analyzes expression data and survival information from The
Cancer Genome Atlas database (23). This analysis revealed that
in 38 melanoma samples, the increased level of HSP70 mRNA was
signiﬁcantly associated with poorer survival (P ¼ 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S2). This association did not hold true for other
family members (not shown). These data support the assignment
of HSP70 as a potential marker of melanoma aggressiveness, but
they do not reveal whether HSP70 overexpression is a driver, or a
consequence, of melanoma progression. To address this issue, we
generated matching melanoma cell lines that express low and
high levels of HSP70, and compared their tumorigenic properties.
Speciﬁcally, we obtained the Yumm1.7 murine melanoma cell
line generated from the BRAF-V600E/PTEN conditional knockout
mouse (24). This cell line expresses modest levels of HSP70, and it
was used to create pooled subclones that express high levels of

HA-tagged HSP70 (Yumm1.7-HSP70; Fig. 1E, inset). Parental
Yumm1.7 and HSP70-overexpressing cell lines were injected
into C57Bl/6 mice as xenografts, and tumor volume was assessed
over time. Notably, there was a marked increase in melanoma
growth rate, tumor volume, and tumor weight in two independent lines that overexpress HSP70 compared with vector-alone
controls (Fig. 1E and F). We also noted increased Ki67 staining,
indicative of proliferating cells, as well as decreased staining for
cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptotic cells, in tumors that
overexpress HSP70, relative to parental controls (Fig. 1G). These
data support HSP70 as a signiﬁcant driver of melanoma growth
and progression.
Phospho-FAK and BRAF-V600E are "clients" of HSP70
To determine the underlying mechanism whereby increased
HSP70 is associated with melanoma tumorigenesis, we sought to
identify melanoma-relevant `client' proteins for HSP70. In this
case, we deﬁne a "client" protein as one whose solubility/folding
requires HSP70, and that interacts with HSP70. To identify these,

we ﬁrst used the technique of reverse RPPA (19, 25) in order to
identify proteins whose signal was decreased following 24-hour
treatment with different concentrations of PET-16. This analysis
revealed 34 proteins that showed signiﬁcantly decreased expression in two different cell lines at several different doses of PET-16
after 24 hours, representing candidate HSP70 client proteins
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Expressions for six of these proteins
that had a FDR <5% in both cell lines and a fold change > 1.5 are
depicted (Fig. 2A). Of these six, we selected two for further analysis
due to their signiﬁcance to melanoma and metastasis: these were
phospho-FAK (p-FAK/PTK2) and BRAF. Western analysis to conﬁrm RPPA results revealed a marked decrease in the level of p-FAK
(Y397) and BRAF following 24 hours of PET-16 treatment in three
different melanoma lines with mutant (1205Lu and WM793) and
wild-type (WM852) BRAF (26; Fig. 2B). To conﬁrm this ﬁnding,
we performed immunoﬂuorescence for p-FAK in PET-16–treated
cells. This analysis revealed a dramatic loss of p-FAK staining in
WM793 and WM852 cell lines after PET-16 treatment (Fig. 2C);

2724 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

notably, this loss of p-FAK staining was evident after as little as
2-hour exposure to PET-16 (A. Budina-Kolomets, unpublished
data). Immunoprecipitation–Western blot analysis conﬁrmed
that both p-FAK and BRAF were detectable in a complex with
HSP70 (Fig. 2D and E; Supplementary Fig. S4A). These analyses
conﬁrm p-FAK and BRAF as HSP70 client proteins.
HSP70 inhibitors block melanoma migration, invasion, and
metastatic capability
Given the role of FAK (particularly the autophosphorylated,
activated p-Y397 form) in tumor-invasive phenotypes, we next
sought to assess the impact of PET-16 on migration and invasion.
We ﬁrst performed conventional "scratch-wound" assays wherein
the ability of tumor cells to migrate and ﬁll in an area is assessed by
time-lapse microscopy. For these studies, we were careful to use
concentrations, and timepoints of PET-16 treatment were not
cytotoxic, and that did not inhibit cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C). These scratch-wound assays revealed

that after PET-16 treatment, the ability of 1205Lu cells to migrate
and ﬁll in a wound was markedly impaired (Fig. 3A). By 48 hours,
the DMSO control sample was completely ﬁlled in, whereas the
PET-16 sample was less than 50% completed (Fig. 3B). Time-lapse
microscopy conﬁrmed that PET-16–treated cells continued to
proliferate, while ceasing to migrate (see Supplementary Movie).
To extend this ﬁnding, we performed Transwell migration assays.
Again, at doses that are noncytotoxic or cytostatic, we noted
signiﬁcantly impaired migration of 1205Lu cells following treatment with PET-16 (Fig. 3C).
We next assessed the impact of low doses of PET-16 on the
ability of metastatic melanoma to invade in three dimensional
(3D) skin reconstructions. The skin reconstructions recapitulate
human skin by including keratinocytes, ﬁbroblasts, and melano-

ma cells, embedded in a collagen matrix (17). Highly invasive
melanoma tumors then invade into the ﬁbroblast/collagen
matrix, reminiscent of the actual scenario in the skin. Skin reconstructs made with the 1205Lu melanoma and treated with DMSO
showed extensive ability to invade into the ﬁbroblast layer (Fig.
3D, left). In contrast, 1205Lu cells treated with 0.5 mmol/L PET-16
failed to invade (right). The depth of invasiveness in multiple skin
reconstructs was measured, and the difference in invasiveness
between DMSO and PET-16–treated cells was highly signiﬁcant
(0.08 mm vs. 0.01 mm; P < 0.05; Fig. 3E). Similar ﬁndings
were made in the primary melanoma line FS5 (Supplementary
Fig. S4D). Boyden chamber assays were then used to measure
the ability of melanoma cells to migrate and invade through
a collagen matrix. These assays conﬁrmed that melanoma

FAK is required for the ability of PET-16 to inhibit melanoma invasiveness. A, Western blot analysis of the level of total FAK in pooled 1205Lu cells infected

assay of 1205Lu cells described in A treated with DMSO or 0.5 mmol/L of PET-16 for 24 hours. Equal numbers of cells were seeded in the Boyden chamber

quantiﬁed in ﬁve different ﬁelds for each experimental group and averaged. Data are the averaged results of three independent experiments. Error bars, SE.

invasiveness is markedly impeded by PET-16 (Fig. 3F and G).
Time course analyses indicated that invasion of 1205Lu cells was
impaired after as little as 2 hours of incubation with PET-16
(Supplementary Fig. S4E and S4F). We next sought to determine
whether the inhibition of invasiveness by PET-16 was due to the
speciﬁc inhibition of p-FAK. To address this, we silenced FAK in
1205Lu cells using either of two different short hairpins, and
assessed the ability of PET-16 to inhibit invasion. As expected,
silencing of FAK with either of two short hairpins (Supplementary
Fig. S4G) markedly diminished the ability of cells to invade in
Boyden chamber assays (Fig. 4A and B). Notably, however,
silencing FAK diminished the ability of PET-16 to further inhibit
invasion, and the percent inhibition of invasion by PET-16 was
markedly greater in shControl cells, compared with shFAK (P ¼
0.005; Fig. 4B and C). These data point to FAK as a signiﬁcant
target for the ability of PET-16 to inhibit melanoma invasion and
migration.
We next sought to assess the ability of HSP70 inhibitors to
inhibit melanoma metastasis. To do this, we utilized the B16F10 melanoma cell line, which is commonly used in metastasis
assays because it is pigmented and easy to track as lung metastases after tail vein injection. We ﬁrst established the IC50 for
PET-16 and PES-Cl in the B16-F10 cell line. We found that this
cell line shows an IC50 of 15.5 mmol/L and 17.5 mmol/L for PESCl and PET-16, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B).
We pretreated B16-F10 cells for 24 hours with dilution vehicle
alone, or 3 mmol/L of either PES-Cl or PET-16; this low dose
caused no loss of cell viability of B16-F10 cells, even when cells
were treated every other day for 10 days (Supplementary Fig.
S5C). Cells were treated for 24 hours and then injected into the
tail veins of C57Bl/6 mice; after 1 week, mice were treated once
per week with intraperitoneal doses of dilution vehicle, PES-Cl
(20 mg/kg) or PET-16 (5 mg/kg; Fig. 5A). After three treatments,
we analyzed the lungs of these mice for the number and size of
metastases. Treatment with DMSO resulted in lungs that were
full of melanoma tumors after 3 weeks (Fig. 5B). However,
treatment with either PES-Cl or to a greater extent PET-16
resulted in a profound reduction in the number and volume of
metastases in mice. This was evident visually by melanin pig-

2726 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

ment (Fig. 5B), and by hematoxylin and eosin staining of
sectioned lungs (Fig. 5B, bottom plots). Quantiﬁcation of metastases in PES-Cl and PET-16–treated mice revealed a marked
decrease in metastases in these mice, compared with control
(Fig. 5C). Immunoﬂuorescent staining of the melanoma tumors
in treated mice revealed that phospho-FAK staining was markedly reduced in the tumors of treated mice, conﬁrming that the
drugs reached these tumors (Fig. 5D). We conﬁrmed that the
autophagy scaffold protein p62SQSTM1, which accumulates and
aggregates following PET-16 treatment, showed accumulation in
the tumors of treated mice, especially in mice treated with PET16 (Supplementary Fig. S5D and S5E).
The HSP70 inhibitor PET-16 synergizes with BRAF inhibitors
in vitro and enhances the efﬁcacy of BRAF inhibition in vivo
In addition to p-FAK, our data indicated that BRAF is a client of
HSP70. To explore this further, we obtained ﬁve matched pairs of
melanoma biopsy samples from patients, prior to treatment
with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (before therapy), and after
resistance and relapse from therapy (after therapy). These
matched samples were stained with HSP70 antibody and scored
in a blinded manner. Notably, in all ﬁve matched samples, the
level of staining of HSP70 (red stain) increased signiﬁcantly
following the emergence of resistance (Fig. 6A), in a manner that
was statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.05; Fig. 6B). To extend this
ﬁnding, we next assessed the IC50 for the BRAF inhibitor Vemurafenib (PLX4032) in the presence and absence of PET-16. At a
constant molar ratio of 10:1 (PET-16:PLX4032), the IC50 for
PLX4032 decreased 4-fold and 8-fold, respectively, in 1205Lu
and WM35 cells, suggesting that these two drugs cooperate (Fig.
6C and D). We next assessed synergy using the CI analysis in ﬁve
different melanoma cell lines with mutant BRAF, as per ref.13.
Notably, there was evidence for synergy of PET-16 and PLX4032 in
all ﬁve cell lines, and there was strong synergy (cI<0.5) in two
lines, WM35 and WM164 (Fig. 6E). Synergy was evident at several
different ratios of each drug (Supplementary Table S1), and was
consistent using an independent assay for cell viability (Trypan
Blue; Supplementary Fig. S7C). Recent studies indicate that other
autophagy inhibitors can synergize with BRAF inhibitors,

the tail vein of C57Bl/6 mice. At day 7, weekly treatment was initiated with PES-Cl and PET-16 at the doses indicated. After 3 weeks, the lungs of mice were
assessed for the presence of metastatic nodules. B, representative images of lung metastases (top) and hematoxylin and eosin staining (bottom) from C57Bl/6 mice

mediated by the induction of ER stress (27); however, we found
limited evidence that PET-16 causes signiﬁcant ER stress in melanoma (Supplementary Fig. S6).
It next became logical to test the efﬁcacy of combination
therapy using these two compounds. Toward this end, we analyzed subcutaneous tumors from the 1205Lu cell line in immunocompromised mice; this cell line was chosen because it shows
only moderate sensitivity to BRAF inhibition (28). Forty mice
were injected subcutaneously with 1205Lu cells, and tumors were
allowed to engraft for 8 days, after which mice were randomly
separated into four groups. Each group of 10 mice was treated
twice weekly with intraperitoneal doses of dilution vehicle alone,
PET-16 (5 mg/kg), PLX4720 in chow (PLX4032 is the clinical
analogue of PLX4720), or the combination of PET-16 (5 mg/kg)
plus PLX4720 in chow (Fig. 6F). There were linear increases in
tumor volume in DMSO-treated mice, whereas PLX4720 led to an
initial decrease in tumor volume, followed by waning antitumor
efﬁcacy with time (blue line; Fig. 6G). Addition of low-dose
(5 mg/kg) PET-16 greatly enhanced the efﬁcacy of PLX4720
[P < 0.0001 comparing PLX4720 vs. PET-16 (5 mg/kg) plus
PLX4720; Fig. 6G, red line]. Immunoﬂuorescence and IHC analyses conﬁrmed markedly decreased p-FAK and BRAF staining in
PET-16–treated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). We
did not observe any weight loss or signs of toxicity for any of these
treatment arms (A. Budina-Kolomets; unpublished data). As a
ﬁnal conﬁrmation of the usefulness of PET-16 for melanoma
treatment, we analyzed the efﬁcacy of this compound in tumors
with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. We found no difference in the cytotoxicity of PET-16 in tumor cells resistant to

PLX4032, compared with parental tumor lines (Fig. 6H). These
data support the use of HSP70 inhibitors for melanoma therapy.

Discussion
It is well established that one of the best markers for the
detection of tumor versus normal cells is the stress-induced heat
shock protein HSP70 (5). In this study, we chose to focus on
HSP70 and melanoma, due to the enormous propensity in this
tumor type for aneuploidy and mutation, both of which lead to
considerable proteotoxic stress (29). Currently, the role for HSP70
in melanoma is not clear. Two studies showed that HSP70 overexpression occurs in melanoma and is associated with BRAF
mutation (20) and drug resistance (21). In contrast, another study
found high levels of HSP70 associated with improved prognosis,
especially in patients with tumors greater than 1.5 mm in size
(22). In this study, we provide evidence that HSP70 supports
melanoma progression. We show that HSP70 overexpression
causes increased tumor proliferation and decreased apoptosis,
and that this protein shows the highest expression in metastatic
melanoma. The reasons for the discrepancies regarding the role of
HSP70 in melanoma are unclear, but may reﬂect the fact that this
protein can localize to different compartments in the cell. When
HSP70 localizes to cytosolic, nuclear, and lysosomal compartments, it promotes cancer progression; alternatively, this protein
can be extracellular and promote antitumor immunity (30).
One consistent ﬁnding among multiple groups is that silencing
or inhibiting HSP70 in melanoma cell lines and other tumors
leads to senescence and apoptosis (7, 31–34). Both a peptide

A Novel HSP70 Inhibitor for Treatment of Melanoma

aptamer that binds and inhibits this chaperone (35) and a smallmolecule inhibitor of HSP70 (36) have shown anticancer efﬁcacy
in an allograft model of mouse melanoma. HSP70 is an obligate
co-chaperone for HSP90, and targeting HSP90 has shown significant promise in the treatment of melanoma (37, 38). Therefore,
HSP70 is a compelling new therapeutic target for this tumor. The
group of Garrido showed previously that a peptide–aptamer
inhibitor of HSP70 was efﬁcacious against the murine melanoma
allograft model B16-F10, grown subcutaneously. Interestingly, in
the tumors of treated mice, this group noted that regression of the
tumors was accompanied by signiﬁcant immune cell inﬁltration
(35). To explore this same possibility, we analyzed PET-16–
treated melanoma tumors and found that these treated tumors
also showed marked accumulation of leukocytes inﬁltrating the
tumors, compared with the vehicle controls (Supplementary Fig.
S5F, arrows). These data indicate that HSP70 inhibitors may affect
immune cell recruitment, and they support the testing in preclinical models of combinations of HSP70 inhibitors with immune
checkpoint antibodies. We are currently pursuing this avenue.
In this work, we show that pFAK is a novel HSP70 client protein
and that inhibition of p-FAK by PET-16 explains part of the
mechanism for reduced invasiveness following HSP70 inhibition.
We should note however that two other proteins implicated in
melanoma metastasis were identiﬁed in our RPPA assay as downregulated following PET-16 treatment: ERBB3 and FOXM1 (Supplementary Fig. S3; refs. 39, 40). Therefore, it remains formally
possibly that the inactivation of these proteins also contributes to
the ability of PET-16 to inhibit melanoma metastasis. We also ﬁnd
that mutant B-RAF is an HSP70 client protein, and that treatment
of tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo leads to markedly decreased
expression of mutant B-RAF. Further, we ﬁnd that PET-16 synergizes with PLX4032 in ﬁve different melanoma cell lines, and that
PET-16 improves the durability of response to BRAF inhibition.
There are two possible explanations for this synergy. The ﬁrst is
that PET-16 and BRAF inhibit BRAF in parallel. The second is that
common mechanisms for resistance to BRAF inhibitors include
overexpression of AKT, mTOR, C-RAF, and RB (41); these were all
identiﬁed as HSP70 client proteins in our RPPA analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3). The emergence of resistance to BRAF inhibitors is a signiﬁcant clinical problem, so the identiﬁcation of
compounds like PET-16 is an important advance.
