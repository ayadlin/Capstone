ABSTRACT
Neuroblastoma (NB), which accounts for about 15% of cancer-related mortality
in children, is the most common childhood extracranial malignant tumor. In NB,
somatic mutations of the tumor suppressor, p53, are exceedingly rare. Unlike in
adult tumors, the majority of p53 downstream functions are still intact in NB cells
with wild-type p53. Thus, restoring p53 function by blocking its interaction with
p53 suppressors such as MDM2 is a viable therapeutic strategy for NB treatment.
Herein, we show that MDM2 inhibitor SAR405838 is a potent therapeutic drug for
NB. SAR405838 caused significantly decreased cell viability of p53 wild-type NB cells
and induced p53-mediated apoptosis, as well as augmenting the cytotoxic effects of
doxorubicin (Dox). In an in vivo orthotopic NB mouse model, SAR405838 induced
apoptosis in NB tumor cells. In summary, our data strongly suggest that MDM2specific inhibitors like SAR405838 may serve not only as a stand-alone therapy, but
also as an effective adjunct to current chemotherapeutic regimens for treating NB
with an intact MDM2-p53 axis.

p53 is a major tumor suppressor that induces cell
growth arrest, apoptosis, and senescence, along with
being one of the most important regulators of multiple
signaling pathways [3-5]. According to previous studies,
p53 is mutated in over 50% of all cancers. However, p53
mutations are exceedingly rare in NB, with less than 2%
occurrence in primary tumors [6, 7]. p53 is reported to
irreversibly induce apoptotic responses in NB cells once
stabilized [8-15], suggesting that the stabilization of
p53 is a possible therapeutic strategy for NB treatment.
The cellular expression, function, and stabilization of

INTRODUCTION
Arising from the sympathetic nervous system,
neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonic tumor that accounts
for about 15% of cancer-related deaths in children [1, 2].
Despite encouraging progress in the outcome during the
past years, the overall survival rate for high-risk NB
patients remains dismal. Current therapies for high-risk
NB, with frequent recurrence and formidable chemoresistance, are still insufficient. Thus, novel targeted
therapies for high-risk NB are urgently needed.

p53 are governed by a complex regulatory network. Of
the factors that regulate p53 activities, Murine double
minute 2 homolog (MDM2) is one of the major negative
regulators [16]. MDM2 binds to p53 and mediates its
poly-ubiquitination and degradation, thus, inhibiting p53
tumor suppressor function [2, 7, 16-23].
In NB cells, MYCN down-regulates p53 and
up-regulates MDM2 at the transcriptional level [24,
25]. PPM1D inhibits p53 tumor suppressor function
by dephosphorylating p53 at Ser15 [26, 27]. UBE2N
promotes the formation of monomeric p53 that results in
cytoplasmic translocation and subsequent loss of tumor
suppressor function [20]. DUSP26 inhibits p53 tumor
suppressor function by dephosphorylating p53 at Ser37
and Ser46 [28, 29]. USP7, an MDM2 deubiquitinase,
deubiquitinates MDM2 and prolongs its half-life to
inhibit the p53 tumor suppressor function [21]. The
overexpression of MDM2 is a typical example of nonmutational p53 inactivation in NB cells, indicating that
the inhibition of p53-MDM2 interactions is capable of
restoring p53 tumor suppressor function. p53-MDM2
binding antagonists are a novel class of anti-tumor
therapeutics in malignancies with intact p53 function,
and has been proposed to be a potential strategy for NB
therapy [9].
Several MDM2 inhibitors, such as Nutlin-3a,
MI-219, MI-63, RG7388, RITA and MLN-8237, etc.,
have all been evaluated previously. However, of the
well-studied MDM2 inhibitors, Nutlin-3a may result in
acquired chemo-resistance, and MI-63 fails to demonstrate
in vivo efficacy. Additionally, many drugs are restricted
from clinical applications due to poor absorption, toxicity
to normal tissues, and the development of resistance [3036]. Thus, an ideal MDM2 inhibitor should have both
efficient antitumor activity and minimal/improved toxicity.
SAR405838 (MI-773), currently in phase-І clinical
trials, is a novel, potent, and orally available MDM2
antagonist that blocks the interaction between MDM2 and
p53. It showed significant antitumor effects by stabilizing
p53 function. Moreover, SAR405838 is effective in
liposarcoma, lymphoma, and leukemia with negligible
toxicity in animal xenograft models [30, 37, 38]. In this
paper, we evaluate the effects of SAR405838 on NB
cell lines. Our results demonstrated that SAR405838
induces p53-mediated apoptosis in NB, suggesting that
this inhibitor is a potential therapeutic tool to add to the
armamentarium for NB patients.

lines. In total, we selected one p53 mutant (SK-N-AS)
and three p53 wild-type (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, and LAN-6) cell lines. The cell viabilities of SY5Y and IMR-32
were greatly reduced both in a dose-dependent manner
with increasing concentrations of SAR405838 and in a
time-dependent manner with increasing treatment time
(Figure 1A). This effect was attenuated in LA-N-6 due
to its innate chemo-resistance; however, when compared
to a lack of SAR405838 treatment, differences were
still observed. In contrast, the p53 mutant cell line,
SK-N-AS, exhibited no reduced cell viability with
SAR405838 treatment (Figure 1A, 1C). The IC50
of SAR405838 in all four cells lines was calculated
(Figure 1B), and our results indicate that SAR405838
inhibits cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner
in NB p53 WT cell lines, but not in p53 mutant lines.
These results were validated by the flow cytometry that
SAR405838 promoted apoptosis in p53 WT cell line
IMR-32, but not in the p53 mutant cell line SK-N-AS
(Supplementary Figure S1).

MDM2 inhibitor SAR405838 inhibits colony
formation ability of the p53 WT NB cell lines
To evaluate whether SAR405838 could inhibit the
colony formation abilities of NB cell lines, we performed
soft agar assays. In this assay, we found that the p53 WT
cell lines (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, and LA-N-6), but not
the p53 mutant one (SK-N-AS), showed a significantly
decreased ability to form colonies after SAR405838
treatment compared with vehicle-treated control
(Figure 2A). Colony numbers were calculated in each
group (Figure 2B), revealing that SAR405838 significantly
attenuated anchorage-independent growth of the p53 WT
NB cells in a dose-dependent manner.

SAR405838 induces p53-mediated apoptosis in
p53 WT NB cell lines
According to prior studies, SAR405838
inhibits MDM2 from ubiquitinating and binding to
p53, consequently, stabilizing it [39]. As a result, we
hypothesized that SAR405838 could block the p53/
MDM2 axis and promote activation of the p53 pathway
in the p53 WT NB cells. The level of p53 and downstream
p21, BAX, PUMA, as well as MDM2 and the apoptosis
related protein PARP and Caspase 3, were examined by
immunoblotting assays. Consistent with our hypothesis,
SAR405838 induced p53 accumulation in all p53 WT NB
cell lines (Figure 3A), whereas the p53 level in SK-N-AS
cells was not affected (Figure 3B). Moreover, in strong
contrast to the control (0 h), all the cell lines except SK-NAS demonstrated obvious PARP and Caspase 3 cleavage
with increasing treatment time. Our data indicates that
SAR405838 promotes p53-mediated apoptosis in the p53
WT NB cells.

SAR405838 enhances the cytotoxic effect of dox
in the p53 WT NB cell lines

Luciferase-transduced SH-SY5Y cells were surgically
injected into the left renal capsule of nude mice. Two weeks
after injection, tumor signals were detected by bioluminescent
imaging (data not shown). Mice were randomly divided
into two groups and treated with either dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) (carrier control) or SAR405838 (intraperitoneally
injected 30 mg/kg daily for 3 days). Then, tumors from the
mice treated with SAR405838 were harvested and analyzed
for p53 pathway and apoptotic effectors. Consistent with
the in vitro data, SAR405838 induced p53, MDM2, p21,
BAX and PUMA expression, as well as PARP and Caspase
3 cleavage in NB tumor cells of the xenograft mouse model
(Figure 5). These results demonstrate that SAR405838 can
effectively induce p53-mediated apoptosis in the p53 WT NB
tumors developed in the xenograft mouse model.

In the treatment of high-risk NB, the effects of
monotherapies are less effective due to the development of
chemo-resistance [40]. Since most cancers rapidly acquire
chemo-resistance, the best strategies are combination
therapies. We evaluated the combination effects of
SAR405838 and the traditional anti-NB chemotherapy
drug doxorubicin (Dox) via a panel of three p53 WT NB
cell lines: IMR-32, SH-SY5Y, and LA-N-6. In the chemosensitive cell lines (IMR-32 and SH-SY5Y) we observed
that SAR405838 enhanced Dox-induced p53, MDM2,
p21, BAX and PUMA expressions, and augmented Doxinduced PARP and Caspase 3 cleavage compared to
the effects of Dox alone (Figure 4A, 4B). Then, to test
whether SAR405838 could overcome established chemoresistance in NB cells, the chemo-resistant LA-N-6 cell
line was treated with varying doses of Dox with or without
SAR405838. Remarkably, the addition of SAR405838
augmented Dox-induced cell apoptosis in LA-N-6 cells,
suggesting that SAR405838 sensitized LA-N-6 cells to
Dox-induced apoptosis. Together, these results indicate
that the addition of SAR405838 greatly augmented Doxinduced apoptosis in all p53 WT NB cell lines, suggesting
that the combination of SAR405838 with Dox not only
induces stronger apoptosis in the p53 WT NB cells, but
also effectively combats established chemo-resistance
compared to single drug treatment.

Intact p53-MDM2 axis is required for
SAR405838 to induce p53 target gene expression
in NB cells
To determine whether SAR405838 inhibits cell
proliferation and induces apoptosis in a p53 dependent
manner, we generated a p53-knockout SH-SY5Y cell
line using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genomic editing
technology (Supplementary Figure S2). We found that p53
knockout blocked the ability of SAR405838 to induce p53
target gene expression at both the protein (Figure 6A) and
transcription (Figure 6B) level. These results suggest that
SAR405838 causes p53 activation in NB cells.

potently stabilize p53 in p53 WT NB cell lines [22, 41]. We
compared the inhibitory effect of SAR405838 with RG7388
and Nutlin-3 on one p53 wild-type NB cell line, IMR-32.
We found that these three compounds had similar
inhibitory effect on the cell proliferation (Figure 7A)
and p53 target gene expression as well as PARP and
Caspase 3 cleavage (Figure 7B). These data suggest

that SAR405838 has similar efficacy as RG7388 and
Nutlin-3 in vitro.

DISCUSSION
p53, regulated by multilateral upstream signals, is a
crucial cellular tumor suppressor [14, 42, 43]. A strategy

to restore p53 activity could be a promising therapeutic
option for NB since more than 98% of p53 downstream
functions are still intact in NB [44]. MDM2 is the major
negative regulator of p53 tumor suppressor. Recently,
small molecule inhibitors interfering with the p53/MDM2
axis are generating intense interest. SAR405838 is the
latest oral MDM2 antagonist that attracted our attention
because it has demonstrated high efficacy in multiple
cancer models. SAR405838 effectively stabilizes p53
and activates the p53 pathway, resulting in abrogated
cellular proliferation, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis
in liposarcoma, lymphoma and leukemia with an intact
MDM2-p53 axis [30, 37, 38]. The chemical structure
of SAR405838 not only mimics three key amino acid
residues of p53, but also induces refolding of the short,
unstructured MDM2 N-terminus to achieve its improved
affinity and efficacy [30, 38]. In addition, compared
to already available intraperitoneally injected MDM2
inhibitors, SAR405838 should have better absorption
and a higher potential for clinical applications since
it is orally available. In addition, prior studies suggest
that SAR405838 is more potent than relevant MDM2
inhibitors such as Nutlin3a and MI-63, since under
identical conditions, lower SAR405838 concentrations
are needed to produce the same effect compared with
those of Nutlin3a and MI-63 [35]. In addition, when

compared with other MDM2 antagonists RG7388 and
Nutlin-3, which have demonstrated significant efficacy
in a variety of cancer types in vitro [45-47], SAR405838
had shown a similar inhibitory effect on NB cells.
With the collaborations of cooperative group trials
in the US and around the world, low and intermediate
risk NB have overall good outcomes. However, high-risk
NB still demonstrates a need for marked improvement
in outcomes, and novel, mechanism-based therapeutic
trials could play an important role to bridge this gap. We
investigated whether SAR405838 could be an effective
agent and demonstrate prominent anti-proliferative effects
and induction of apoptosis in p53 WT cell lines. Also, as
high-risk NB is often associated with chemo-resistance,
we were pleased to note that SAR405838 could sensitize
chemo-resistant cell line LA-N-6 to Doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis. These results suggest that SAR405838 could
potentially be beneficially combined with existing
treatment regimens for high-risk NB.
Here, we report the inhibitory effects of the MDM2
inhibitor SAR405838 (a potent p53 stabilizer) on NB
cells. SAR405838 inhibits cell proliferation, induces
apoptosis and upregulates mRNA and protein expression
of the p53 pathway on p53 WT NB cell lines. Moreover,
consistent with our in vitro data, SAR405838 is capable
of inducing p53-mediated apoptosis in an orthotopic NB

overcome the chemo-resistance in the NB cell line LAN-6, the combination with Dox did lessen this concern,
sensitizing NB cells to Dox-mediated cytotoxic effect.

In conclusion, our preclinical studies provide the
rationale to evaluate MDM2 inhibitor SAR405838 in the
therapeutic regimen of NB patients with intact MDM2-p53
axis.

FACDiva software v.6.0.

Colony formation assay
The soft agar assay for detecting colony formation
abilities was performed as previously described [20].
Namely, a 5% (w/v) base agar layer was made by adding
agar (214220, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) into
distilled water and then autoclaving the mixture for 50
min before cooling in a 56 °C water bath. This solution
was then mixed with RPMI and 10% FBS to a final
concentration of 0.5%. To make the bottom agar layer, 2
mL of the 0.5% agar/RPMI solution were added to each
well and cooled until semi-solid. The top agar layer was
made of 1.5 ml 0.3% agar, and each NB cell line was
counted and added to the mixture at 1 × 104 cells/well
along with the indicated concentrations of SAR405838.
Cells were grown at 37 °C for 2 to 3 weeks, and
subsequently stained with 500 µL of 5 mg/mL Thiazolyl
Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT, M5655, Sigma).
Images were captured by the microscope, and colonies
were counted after 4 hours. Each assay was performed in
triplicate.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was calculated using the Cell Counting
Kit-8 (CCK-8, WST-8[2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2, 4-disulfophenyl)-2 H-tetrazolium,
monosodium salt]) (Dojindo Laboratories, Rockville,
MA, USA). Cells were plated and grown in 96-well
clear-bottom plates starting at 1 × 104 cells/well. After 24
hours of incubation, the medium was changed. Increasing
concentrations of SAR405838, Dox, or a combination
of both were added to the wells, and the cells were then
incubated for another 24 hours or 72 hours. Then, a
mixture of 10 µL of CCK-8 and 190 µL of RPMI with
10% or 20% FBS were added into each well respectively.
After 1 hour of incubation, the absorbance was measured
at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Each experiment was
performed in duplicates of six and background reading of
the medium was subtracted from each well to standardize
the results.

Protein immunoblotting
Cells were lysed and then separated by SDSPAGE. After each treatment, cells were washed
twice with ice cold PBS and then lysed on a rotator
at 4 °C for 30 min in cooled RIPA buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 50 mM sodium
fluoride, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1
mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 µg/mL leupeptin, 1%
NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail 2 and 3 (p5726 and p0044, Sigma)).
We collected cell pellets after centrifuging for 5 min
at 6,000 rpm and then lysed the cells on ice for 30
min followed by centrifuging for 15 min at 13,000
rpm to collect supernatants as cell lysates. Protein
concentration in cell lysates were measured using
Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA, USA), and samples were mixed in a 3:1 ratio
(v/v) with 4 × loading buffer, respectively, and heated
at 100 °C for 6 min. Lysates were separated by SDSPAGE, transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidence fluoride)
membranes (BioRad), blocked with 5% milk for one
hour at room temperature (25 °C), and probed with
appropriate dilutions of indicated primary antibodies
overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then incubated
with anti-mouse or rabbit IgG conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1hr.
The ECL-Plus Western detection system (GE Health
Care, Buckinghamshire, UK) was then used for
chemiluminescent visualization.

Cell imaging
A total of four NB cell lines were seeded in 96-well
plates at appropriate concentrations. After 24 hours of
treatment with indicated concentrations of SAR405838,
cell morphologies were observed and captured using an
optical microscope.

Flow cytometry and propidium iodide (PI)
staining assay
The experiment was performed as described
previously [48]. Briefly, cells were seeded with 1 × 106
cells/ 6 cm dish, After 24 h in culture, cells were treated
with 10 μM of SAR405838 for 0 or 24 hours. Cells
were trypsinized, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium,
and then centrifuged at 200 g for 3 min at 4 °C. Cells
were then washed with cold 1× PBS (add 1% BSA)
twice, and resuspended at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml
in 1× binding buffer (51-66121E; BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA). Afterwards, 100 μl of non-fixed cell
suspension was transferred into a new tube and stained
with 5 μl of 50 μg/mL PI staining solution (51-66211E;
BD Biosciences). The cells in the tubes were gently
vortexed and incubated for 15 min at RT (25 °C) in the
dark. Unstained cells were used as a negative control,
and untreated cells were used as a control for treated
cells. Then flow cytometry analyses were performed on

Antitumor efficacy in an orthotopic mouse model
of NB

AG, 3’-CCAGCCCATGATGGTTCTGAT; and5’-TCAAC
GCACA
GTACGAGCGG,
3’-AGG
CACC
TAATTGGGCTCC; respectively. These sets of primers
were synthesize by Sigma-ALDRICH. Then, primers
and templates were mixed according to the SensiFAST
SYBR Hi-ROX One-Step Kit (BIO-73005, BIOLINE).
The mRNA level for each gene was detected by Applied
Biosystems™ Real-Time PCR Instruments.

Four to six-week-old female athymic NCR nude
mice were purchased from Taconic (Taconic, Hudson, NY,
USA) and maintained under barrier conditions (pathogenfree conditions provided by plastic cages with sealed air
filters). The preclinical mouse model of NB was established
using orthotopic (intrarenal) implantation of the NB cells as
described previously [49]. Briefly, a transverse incision was
created over the left flank of the nude mouse and 1.5 × 106
human luciferase-transduced SH-SY5Y cells in 0.1 ml of
PBS were surgically injected into the left renal capsule and
toward the superior pole of the left kidney of the nude mice.
After engrafting for 4 to 5 weeks, mice bearing
tumors with similar sizes (using bioluminescent imaging
to monitor tumor growth) were randomly divided into
two groups and treated with either DMSO or SAR405838
(30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection once daily). Three
days later, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors
were harvested and lysed for immunoblotting. All mice
were handled according to protocols approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Baylor College of Medicine.

Statistical analysis
All values were presented as mean ± standard
deviation (SD). A two-tailed Student’s t-test was used
to determine the statistical significance among drug
treatment groups. Each assay was repeated at least twice,
and representative results were presented. P <0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant. The IC50 value
was calculated by Prism 5 (Graphpad Software Inc., La
Jolla, CA).

Generation of the TP53 gene knockout cell
line through CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genomic
editing technology

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING
We appreciate Dr. Andrew Davidoff (St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA) and
Dr. Robert Seeger (Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles,
Los Angeles, CA, USA) for providing the neuroblastoma
cell lines described in this paper. Dr. Yonghua Shi and
Xinfang Mao were recipients of the China Scholarship
Council training grant (#201408655107 (Y.S.);
#201408655087 (X.M.)).

The lentiviral vector with p53 gRNA
(CCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAAC)
and
Cas9-2Apuromycin expression cassettes was transfected with
packaging vectors (Hgpm, Tat-1b, Rev-1b and VSVG)
into 293T cells. After 24 hours of incubation, the viral
supernatants were collected. The viral supernatants mixed
with 4 μg/ml polybrene were used to transduce SH-SY5Y
cells (2.5 × 106 cells/ dish). The transduced cells were
then selected by treating cells with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin
for 3 to 4 days. The single cell clone with p53 knockout
was verified by PCR flanking the target site followed by
cloning the PCR products and sequencing analysis.

GRANT SUPPORT
This work was supported by the National Science
Foundation of China 31300741 (T.Y.), the NIH/NINDS
grant 1R01NS072420 (J.Y.), 1R21NS085467 (J.Y.) and
1R21NS094654 (J.Y.), and the Cancer Prevention and
Research Institute of Texas grant RP110187 (J.G.N.).

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNAs were extracted from cell lines using
TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen™ Ambion™). RNA purity
and quantity were determined using a spectrophotometer
measuring absorbance at 260/280 nm. The sequences for
TP53, MDM2, CDKN1A, BAX and BBC3 were retrieved
from GenBank of National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) database. Based on NCBI database,
primers of TP53, MDM2, CDKN1A, BAX and BBC3
were designed as 5’-CAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGT,
