ABSTRACT
Retinoblastoma (RB) arises from the retina, and its growth usually occurs
under the retina and toward the vitreous. Ideal therapy should aim to inhibit the
tumor and protect neural cells, increasing the patient’s life span and quality of life.
Previous studies have demonstrated that Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is associated
with neurogenesis, neovascularization and tumorigenesis. However, at present, the
bioactivity of TSP-1 in retinoblastoma has not been defined. Herein, we demonstrated
that TSP-1 was silenced in RB cell lines and clinical tumor samples. HDAC inhibitor,
Trichostatin A (TSA), could notably transcriptionally up-regulate TSP-1 in RB cells,
WERI-Rb1 cells and Y79 cells. Moreover, we found human recombinant TSP-1
(hTSP-1) could significantly inhibit the cell viability of RB cells both in vitro and
in vivo. Interestingly, hTSP-1 could significantly induce the expression of γ-H2AX, a
well-characterized in situ marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in RB cells.
The DNA NHEJ pathway in WERI-Rb1 cells could be significantly inhibited by hTSP-1.
A mutation in Rb1 might be involved in the hTSP-1-medicated γ-H2AX increasing in
WERI-Rb1 cells. Furthermore, hTSP-1 could inhibit RB cells while promoting retinal
neurocyte survival in the neuronal and retinoblastoma cell co-culture system. As such,
TSP-1 may become a therapeutic target for treatment of retinoblastoma.

TSP-1, a matricellular protein, plays multiple
roles in tumor development [3, 4]. It is clear that TSP-1
is involved in inhibiting angiogenesis both in vitro and
in vivo [4–5]. However, the expression level of TSP-1
is different in divergent types of tumors. For example,
TSP-1 is highly expressed in the cells of thyroid cancer,
breast and colon cancer, and glioma [6–9]. In contrast,
TSP-1 is silenced in a subset of undifferentiated,
advanced-stage tumors and neuroblastoma cell lines [10].
Currently, the expression level of TSP-1 in retinoblastoma
remains unclear, although some studies have indicated
that TSP-1 is present in the intraocular fluids and drainage
pathway, where it might function in maintaining the
anti-angiogenic environment and in intraocular pressure
control, respectively [11].
Moreover, the role of TSP-1, which has been
identified either as a tumor suppressor or as a tumor
promoter, in cancer progression remains controversial
[4]. Some studies have demonstrated that TSP-1 promotes
tumor growth by enhancing cell migration, invasion and

INTRODUCTION
Retinoblastoma is a pediatric eye tumor arising
in the retina, representing the most common childhood
intraocular malignancy. Despite a good understanding
of its etiology, mortality from retinoblastoma is
approximately 70% in countries of low and middle
income. Worldwide, most of the estimated 9000 newly
diagnosed patients every year will unfortunately die
[1]. Currently, several treatments are available for
retinoblastoma, including chemotherapy, radioactive
plaque, external beam radiotherapy, cryotherapy and
surgery [2]. However, each of these therapies has major
drawbacks for pediatric patients. Ideal therapeutic agents
for the treatment of tumors should possess the following
properties: inhibition of the proliferation of tumor cells
and protection of neurons against the excitotoxicity
induced by retinoblastoma cells. New adjuvant treatments
with better safety and efficacy profiles are needed for
retinoblastoma.

proliferation [12, 13]. TSP-1 promoted tumor cell invasion
and metastasis by cooperating with VEGF, FGF2, and
TGF-β2 [14, 15]. TSP-1 levels were higher in patients
with advanced breast cancer vs. patients with early breast
cancer [16]. Elevated secretion of TSP-1 has sometimes
been considered a predictive factor in diagnosis [3].
However, multiple evidences exist indicating that TSP-1
inhibited angiogenesis by direct effects on endothelial cell
migration and survival by activating CD36, caspase-3 and
VEGFR-2 [17, 18]. Conflicting results have been obtained,
indicating that TSP-1 could paracrinically inhibit tumor
angiogenesis and suppress the growth of solid tumors by
the BMP4/thrombospondin-1 loop [19]. In addition, TSP1 might be associated with DNA damage. TSP-1 could
stimulate phosphorylation of p47 and increase production of
superoxide, which induced cell death [20]. TSP-1 signaling
could correspondingly increase high radiosensitivity.
Conversely, soft tissues in TSP-1-null mice are remarkably
resistant to radiation injury [21]. Guo’s study directly
demonstrated that intact TSP-1 and its active type I repeat
peptides could cause DNA disability and result in notably
DNA fragments in endothelial cells [22]. Moreover, one
patent related to TSP-1 in cancer therapy has been approved
by the U.S. FDA [23]. Knockdown of TSP-1 resulted in a
reduction in the adhesion and migration/invasion of human
thyroid cancer cells [6]. Currently, the bioactivity of TSP-1
in retinoblastoma has been not well defined.
Furthermore, more evidence has indicated that TSP1 plays an important role in neural development and neural
protection [24]. Blake et al reported that TSP-1 promoted
neural cell migration by binding to ApoER2 in postnatal
neuronal migration [25]. TSP-1 astrocyte-secreted proteins
could promote CNS synaptogenesis [26, 27]. TSP-1 is
necessary for synaptic plasticity and functional recovery
after stroke [28, 29]. Additionally, our previous study
proved that TSP-1 secreted by bone marrow stromal cells
could contribute to retinal ganglion cell neurite outgrowth
and survival [30]. The treatment of retinoblastoma by
surgery or other procedures often causes damage to the
neurocytes of the retina. Therefore, determining the
bioactivity of TSP-1 in retinoblastoma might be helpful
not only for tumor therapy but also for retinal protection.
Based on the evidence above, we sought to
determine the expression profile and bioactivity of TSP-1
in retinoblastoma cells both in vitro and in vivo conditions,
and examined the possible underlying mechanisms of
TSP-1-mediated anti-retinoblastoma action.

oncologists. A lobular type of human breast cancer tissue
sample was used as a positive control. Our results showed
that TSP-1 was silenced in the human retinoblastoma,
whereas it was expressed in the human breast cancer
(Figure 1A). Moreover, we measured TSP-1 expression
level in other 3 samples and WERI-Rb1 cells by RT-PCR
and western blot. As shown in Figure 1B, TSP-1 was
absent in the three clinical RB samples (Line1-3) and
WERI-Rb1 cells (Line 4), compared to Hela cells (Line 5).
Epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to be
responsible for the silencing of TSP-1 in a variety of
human cancers [10, 31]. Thus, to examine the role of
DNA demethylation and histone deacetylase activity
played in the silencing of the TSP-1 gene, WERI-Rb1
cells were treated with the demethylating agent 5-AzadC and the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA, alone or in
combination. Our results showed that TSP-1 was notably
induced by TSA (500 nM) in WERI-Rb1 cells, whereas
treatment with 5-Aza-dC (5 μM) had no effect on TSP-1
expression (Figure 1C). As shown in Figure 1D, TSP-1
was induced by TSA in a dose-dependent manner. WERIRb1 cells treated with 250 nM TSA markedly expressed
TSP-1, compared to the controls by RT-PCR assay. To
further validate the expression level of TSP-1 in the
retinoblastoma cells, we analyzed its expression level in
two kinds of RB cell lines, WERI-Rb1 and Y79. Realtime RT-PCR assay indicated the mRNA level of TSP-1
was barely detectable in both WERI-Rb1 and Y79 cells,
however, significantly up-regulated upon 250 nM TSA
treatment for 48 hours (Figure 1E). Moreover, TSA has
shown stronger effect in inducing the expression of TSP1 on Y79 cells (by 3.25-fold) than on WERI-Rb1 cells
(by 1.18-fold) (*p<0.05). Furthermore, western blot and
immunohistofluorescence assay also demonstrated that
the expression level of TSP-1 in both WERI-Rb1 and Y79
cells was time-dependently increased after treatment with
TSA (Figure 1F and 1G).
Moreover, we examined acetylated histone H3, as
well as total histone H3 levels, to demonstrate that the
inhibition of histone deacetylase by TSA resulted in a
global increase in histone acetylation. Western blot was
performed to assay the expression of acetylated histone
H3, acetylated at Lys14, 27, 56 and K18, in WERIRb1 cells after treatment with 250 nM TSA at different
time points. As shown in Figure 2A, the basal levels of
acetylated histone were quite low in the control cells,
compared to the expression of histone H3. Acetylated
histone H3, at Lys14, 27, 56 and K18, was dramatically
increased at 6 h and 12 h and then decreased to basal
levels at 24 h in TSA-treated WERI-Rb1 cells, compared
to the untreated cells. To determine which HDAC
isoform was responsible for the induction of TSP-1 gene
expression, we also examined the effects of treatment with
the HDAC inhibitor TSA on the expression of the various
HDAC genes by RT-PCR assay. As shown in Figure 2B,
TSA remarkably reduced the expression levels of HDAC4

and HDAC8. Except for the expression changes in
HDAC4 and HDAC8, the expression of the other HDAC
genes was not altered to a significant extent (data not
shown). Western blot assay also confirmed this outcome
(Figure 2C).

To further define that histone deacetylation is
involved in TSP-1 silencing, WERI-Rb1 cells transfected
with the construct, which contains human TSP-1 promoter
sequences from -2033 to +750 and a chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase (CAT)-encoding reporter gene, were

CAT assay. As shown in Figure 2D, TSA significantly
increased CAT activity in WERI-Rb1 cells in a dosedependent manner, compared to the controls (Control, 0;
250 nM, 6.711±1.757; 500 nM, 11.987±4.49; respectively.

cells. Figure 3A shows the microscopic photographs of
WERI-Rb1 cells and Y79 cells treated with 25 nM hTSP1 for 120 h. Both the WERI-Rb1 and Y79 cells treated
with hTSP-1 were much more scattered than the controls,
which characteristically grew in loose, grape-like clusters.
Furthermore, many cells presented massive membrane
blebs among the cells treated with hTSP-1, while such
blebs were completely absent in the untreated control
cells, which might be a characteristic feature of apoptosis
as part of a necrotic process. The growth-inhibitory effects
of hTSP-1 on the human retinoblastoma cell lines WERIRb1 and Y79 was evaluated in vitro at different time points
using a CCK8 assay. Cell viability was represented by
quantile normalization in log2 scale. As shown in Figure
3B, the viability of WERI-Rb1 cells treated with hTSP1 was significantly reduced continuously (hTSP-1, 24 h,
-0.232±0.109; 48 h, -0.313±0.050; 72 h, -0.292±0.049;
96, -0.432±0.089; 120 h, -0.425±0.041, respectively),

hTSP-1 inhibits cell viability and induces cell
cycle arrest in WERI-Rb1 cells in vitro
TSA could induce the re-expression of TSP-1 in both
WERI-Rb1 cells and Y79 cells. However, TSA induced
global acetylation in cells, which affected a massive
number of genes. Thus, to evaluate the exact effects of
TSP-1 on retinoblastoma cells, in parallel, hTSP-1 was
added to the medium of the WERI-Rb1 cells and Y79

compared to the controls (Control, 0) (*p<0.05, **p<0.01),
demonstrating that hTSP-1 could significantly inhibit the
growth of WERI-Rb1 cells. Consistently, incubation with
the exogenous hTSP-1 could also markedly inhibit the cell
viability of Y79 cells (hTSP-1, 24 h, -0.107±0.038; 48 h,
-0.241±0.094; 72 h, -0.408±0.102; 96, -0.381±0.114; 120
h, -0.489±0.083, respectively) (*p<0.05, **p<0.01).
In addition, the incidence of early and late
apoptosis induced by hTSP-1 in both WERI-Rb1 cells
and Y79 cells was quantified by flow cytometry after
Annexin V and PI staining. As shown in Figure 3C
and 3E, TSP-1 could induce apoptosis in RB cells.
Late but not early apoptosis was significantly induced
in both WERI-Rb1 cells and Y79 cells followed 48
hours incubation with hTSP-1 (For WERI-Rb1, Early
apoptosis: hTSP-1, 1.496±0.69%, Control, 0.72±1.96%,
p>0.1; Late apoptosis: hTSP-1, 10.366±3.2%, Control,
2.8±2.5%, *p<0.05) (For Y79, Early apoptosis: hTSP1, 1.547±0.43%, Control, 2.166±1.36%, p>0.1; Late
apoptosis: hTSP-1, 14.4±1.14%, Control, 1.176±1.15%,
**p<0.01). Moreover, as shown in Figure 3F, there
was a decrease in the number of WERI-Rb1 cells in
the G0/G1 phase (hTSP-1, 28.74±7.30%, Control,
42.74±5.70%, *p<0.05) and an increase in the number
of cells in the S phase (hTSP-1, 47.00±4.83%, Control,
32.83±6.63% *p<0.05), whereas there was no significant
difference in the number of cells in the G2 phase (hTSP1, 24.26±2.48%, Control, 24.43±2.97%, P>0.1). Similar
result was obtained from Y79 cells treated with hTSP-1,
demonstrating an S phase arrested (G0/G1 phase: hTSP-1,
68.56±2.42%, Control, 82.81±6.11%, *p<0.05. S phase:
hTSP-1, 22.19±3.00%, Control, 15.11±1.68%, *p<0.05.
G2 phase: hTSP-1, 8.47±2.92%, Control, 5.88±2.33%,
p>0.1) (Figure 3G). These results showed that hTSP-1
could induce the impairment of cell cycle progression
and induce S-phase arrest in WERI-Rb1 cells and Y79
cells. Taken together, these results indicated that TSP-1
could also significantly affect proliferation and viability
and thus might be a potential therapeutic candidate for the
treatment of resistant retinoblastoma.

cells and Y79 cells treated with hTSP-1 by 2.86-fold
and 2.49-fold, respectively, compared to the controls
(**p<0.01), consistent with previous report that intact
TSP-1 significantly induced increasing of P21 and DNA
fragmentation in endothelial cells [20, 34]. Therefore,
these results indicated that TSP-1 might be involved
in DNA DSBs repair in both WERI-Rb1 cells and Y79
cells. Dual immunofluorescence of γ-H2AX and DAPI
confirmed that γ-H2AX was present in most WERI-Rb1
cells as well as Y79 cells treated with hTSP-1 (Figure 4C).
The ratio of γ-H2AX foci-positive cells is represented as
a histogram. As shown in Figure 4D, hTSP-1 significantly
resulted in a marked increase in γ-H2AX staining (WERIRb1: 16.53±5.41%, Y79: 22.79±4.62%), compared to the
controls (WERI-Rb1: 2.90±1.20%, Y79: 14.98±2.93%,
**p<0.01).
DNA DSBs repair includes homologous
recombination (HR) and DNA non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ) [35]. To reveal whether TSP-1 was
involved in both pathways, we further assessed NHEJ
and HR activities of WERI-Rb1 cells. The structure of
the NHEJ and HR substrate and the strategy to measure
NHEJ and HR have been described previously [36,
37] and are depicted in Figure 4E; this strategy was
previously developed and has been successfully used
to define the roles of BRCA1, Rb1, Mre11, XRCC4
and Ku80 in the control of DNA DSBs repair in human
cells [32, 35, 38–40]. For NHEJ, the plasmid pEPINHEJ contains a human S/MAR [41], which stably and
independently replicates in WERI-Rb1 cells. Moreover,
there are two I-SceI recognition sites before the reporter
gene GFP. An artificial ATG (ATGART) between the
two sites induces a translational shift, hence preventing
GFP luciferase reporter gene expression. After digestion
with I-SceI, fully complementary cohesive 3-OH singlestranded ends of four bases are produced upon double
cleavage. If rejoining of the double-stranded ends by
NHEJ occurs, then the intact GFP can be translated and
expressed in cells. Alternatively, error-prone NHEJ at
either of the single I-SceI sites can disrupt ATGART,
which also allows for the expression of GFP. In contrast,
precise re-ligation at a single I-SceI site cannot be
detected directly by flow cytometry analysis using this
system. The prevalence of GFP-positive cells represents
the overall proficiency of NHEJ. For HR, the plasmid
pEPI-HR is similar to the NHEJ substrate, which
contains two GFP cDNA fragments after the promoter:
GFP1 occurs at +1 to +400 bp, and GFP2 covers the
whole cDNA. There is an inserter between GFP1 and
GFP2, which results in the abnormal expression of GFP.
After digestion with I-SceI, HR ends are produced. If
HR occurs, GFP is expressed by sharing an extensive
sequence homology. The prevalence of GFP-positive
cells represents the overall proficiency of HR.
To define the role of TSP-1 in the DSB repair
pathway, WERI-Rb1 cells carrying the episomally

hTSP-1 might affect the repair of DNA DSBs by
attenuating the NHEJ of WERI-Rb1 cells
Previous studies have reported that failure of
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair could induce
S-phase arrest in the cell cycle [32]. To elucidate the
mechanism of TSP-1-mediated S-phase arrest in RB cells,
we analyzed the state of DNA DSBs in cells following
exposure to hTSP-1. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B,
hTSP-1 could significantly increase the expression of
γ-H2AX in both WERI-Rb1 cells and Y79 cell by 7.53fold and 10.1-fold, respectively, compared to the controls
at 48 h after treatment (*p<0.05). In addition, P21, which
accumulated at DNA damage sites and was colocalized
with γ-H2AX [33], was also up-regulated in WERI-Rb1

The mutation of Rb1 might be involved in TSP1-mediated DNA DSBs repair in WERI-Rb1 cells

replicating pEPI-NHEJ or pEPI-HR substrate were
treated with 25 nM hTSP-1. At twenty-four hours
after treatment, the cells were transfected with the
I-SceI endonuclease-expressing plasmid. At 48 h after
transfection, the cells were harvested and analyzed
by flow cytometry. Comparison with the data in
Figure 4F demonstrated that the relative efficiency
of NHEJ in the WERI-Rb1 cells treated with hTSP1 (0.192±0.040%) was significantly lower than in the
controls (0.037±0.016%) (*p<0.05). In contrast, the
rejoining levels in the cells revealed that hTSP-1 had no
differential effects on HR in WERI-Rb1 cells (hTSP-1,
0.053±0.040%; control, 0.030±0.024%, p>0.05). Thus,
these findings provided direct evidence that TSP-1
might inhibit DNA NHEJ pathway in WERI-Rb1 cells.
In addition, we performed NHEJ and HR assay in Y79.
However, transfection efficiency in Y97 cells (1%) is
notably low than that of WERI-Rb1 cells (12%). The
efficiency of DNA DSBs repair in the assay is very low
too. Thus, the results from Y79 cells are not significant
in NHEJ and HR assay.

As previous study, the bioactivity of TSP-1mediated DNA repair is associated with cell type [22].
Therefore, we further investigated whether the mutation
of Rb1 is involved in TSP-1-mediated DNA repair in
RB cells. We measured γ-H2AX in RKO cells, a line of
poorly differentiated colon carcinoma cells. Our data is
consistent with the previous report that TSP-1 is silenced
in RKO cells by high DNA methylation [42] (Figure
5A). Interestingly, as shown in Figure 5B, hTSP-1 could
not alter the expression level of γ-H2AX in RKO cells,
compared to that of the controls. Thus, attenuating DNA
DSBs repair by TSP-1 might be specific to RB cells.
Because the up-regulation of γ-H2AX TSP-1mediated occurs in RB cells instead of RKO cells, we
speculated that Rb1, a transcription co-regulator, might
be involved in this process. To elucidate this hypothesis,
WERI-Rb1 cells were transfected with the pEPI-GFP-Rb1
plasmid, expressing wide-type Rb1 and GFP, or the pEPI-

the hTSP-1-induced up-regulation of γ-H2AX in WERI-Rb1 cells. GAPDH was shown as an internal control. Asterisks indicate statistically

vector. GFP-positive cells represented cells expressing
exogenous Rb1. Following treatment with hTSP-1, whole
lysates of WERI-Rb1 cells with and without exogenous
Rb1 were extracted at 48 h post-treatment. Western blot
analysis indicated that exogenous Rb1 could significantly
attenuate the hTSP-1-induced up-regulation of γ-H2AX in
WERI-Rb1 cells (wild-type Rb1, 1.15±0.18), compared
to the control cells (vector, 3.36±0.25) (Figure 5C, 5D)
(**p < 0.01). The expression of γ-H2AX in Y79 was
not changed, which might be caused by low transfect
efficiency (data not shown). Therefore, these results
suggested that a mutation of Rb1 might be involved in the
TSP-1-mediated DNA DSBs repair in WERI-Rb1 cells.

To validate our findings of TSP-1-mediated
inhibition of retinoblastoma cells, we performed a
tumor-response experiment using our mice xenograft
model. A total of 2×105 WERI-Rb1 cells were injected
into the vitreous of right eyes. Two weeks after tumor
implantation, the nude mice were randomized to different
groups receiving injections of hTSP-1 or balanced salt
solution for two weeks. Figure 7A showed that the degree
of exophthalmos in the WERI-Rb1 implantation mice
treated with hTSP-1 was clearly smaller than that of the
controls. In addition, hematoxylin and eosin staining of
representative retinoblastoma tumor showed the structure
of right eye was destroyed. Briefly, fundus photography
showed that tumor growth was significantly inhibited
in mice treated with hTSP-1, compared with that in the
control mice (Figure 7B) (black arrowhead). Because
the degree of exophthalmos was positively related to the
growth of tumors, we used axial length and volume of
the eyeball, which were previously used in clinical and
experimental assays [43, 44], to represent tumor growth.
In hTSP-1 group, the axial length ratio of eyeballs (LTSP/L
) was 1.33±0.132, compared to the controls
1-right TSP-1-left
(LCON-right/LCON-left), in which it was 1.51±0.301 (**p<0.01)
(Figure 7C). Furthermore, the volume ratio of eyeballs
(VTSP-1-right/VTSP-1-left) was 2.37±0.645, and for the control
groups, the volume ratio of eyeballs (VCON-right/VCON-left)
was 3.58±1.903 (**p<0.01) (Figure 7D). These data were
consistent with our results from WERI-Rb1 cells in vitro,
suggesting that TSP-1 suppressed tumor growth, compared
to the controls.

hTSP-1 could inhibit WERI-Rb1 cells and
promote retina neurocyte survival in the
neuronal and retinoblastoma cell co-culture
system
Based on previous studies, in which TSP-1 could
promote retinal neural survival [28–30], we further
defined whether TSP-1 could play the role of a doubleedged sword in the inhibition of retinoblastoma growth
and the protection of neurocytes. Therefore, a coculture system was established to mimic physiological
conditions, in which WERI-Rb1 cells were cultured
in the top chamber and retinal neurons in the bottom
chamber. The cells were treated with 25 nM hTSP-1 for
4 days. As shown in Figure 6A and 6B, the expression
of synaptophysin, a downstream protein of TSP-1
involved in synaptogenesis [26], in retinal neurocytes
was notably up-regulated by TSP-1 according to
immunohistochemical analysis and western blot assay
(Figure 6A, 6B). Moreover, the results of the CCK8 assay revealed that the cell viability of neurocytes
treated with hTSP-1 was not affected on the first day,
compared to the controls. However, at days 2, 3 and 4
after treatment, hTSP-1 could significantly increase
the viability of neurocytes, compared to the controls
by quantile normalization in log2 scale (hTSP-1, D2,
0.188±0.104, D3, 0.212±0.099, D4, 0.183±0.049,
respectively; Control, 0; *p<0.05, **p<0.01)(Figure
6C). In contrast, the growth of WERI-Rb1 cells in the top
chamber was significantly inhibited by hTSP-1 beginning
on the second day after treatment, compared with the
controls (hTSP-1, D1, -0.0178±0.03, D2, -0.182±0.103,
D3, -0.312±0.023 and D4, -0.364±0.044, *p<0.05,
**p<0.01)(Figure 6C). Moreover, hTSP-1 exerted
significantly neuroprotective activity and inhibition
effect on Y79 cells too (For retinal neurons: hTSP-1,
D1, 0.034±0.093 D2, 0.042±0.033; D3, 0.064±0.034;
D4, 0.190±0.098, respectively; Control, 0; *p<0.05;
For Y79: D1, -0.083±0.059, D2, -0.473±0.079; D3,
-0.352±0.072; D4, -0.415±0.195, respectively; Control,
0; *p<0.05, **p<0.01) (Figure 6D). Therefore, our data
indicated that TSP-1 suppressed RB cells growth and had
neuroprotective ability in this co-culture system.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, our results showed that TSP-1
might be a therapeutic target to suppress retinoblastoma
growth. First, we found that TSP-1 was silenced in RB
tumors cells by histone deacetylation. HDAC inhibitor
TSA could significantly induce the re-expression of
TSP-1 in WERI-Rb1 cells and Y79 cells. hTSP-1 could
significantly suppress the growth of RB cells both in vitro
and in vivo. In addition, using a retinoblastoma-neuronal
co-culturing system, we also demonstrated that TSP-1
could significantly inhibit RB cells while promoting retinal
neurocyte survival. These results indicated therapeutic
potential of TSP-1 in the treatment of retinoblastoma.
Moreover, we revealed a mechanism, which we believe
to be novel, by which TSP-1 could significantly induce
γ-H2AX foci, which is a well-characterized in situ marker
of DNA DSBs in both WERI-Rb1 cells and Y79 cells.
Consistent with role of γ-H2AX, TSP-1 inhibited the DNA
NHEJ pathway in WERI-Rb1 cells. Apoptosis assay also
demonstrated that TSP-1 could induce apoptosis in RB
cells. Furthermore, our study revealed that the mutation
of Rb1 might be involved in the TSP-1-medicated DNA

DSBs repair in WERI-Rb1 cells. Thus, our present
findings provided direct biochemical and functional
evidence supporting the notion that TSP-1 might be a
therapeutic target to suppress retinoblastoma growth by
regulation of DNA DSBs repair.
The first thrombospondin to be identified, TSP1, is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and has complex
effects on tumor development [3]. Our data showed
that TSP-1 was silenced in both WERI-Rb1 cells and
Y79 cells. Moreover, our results indicated that the
mechanism of TSP-1 silencing of WERI-Rb1 cells was
involved in histone deacetylation, different from that of
other neuroblast tumors. Yang et al reported that DNA
methylation played a dominant role in neuroblastoma cells
[10].
TSP-1 appears to play numerous and complex
roles in cancer growth and metastasis. The multimodular
structure of TSP-1 confers to these molecules anti-tumoral
as well as pro-tumoral properties [3, 45]. This apparent
discrepancy depends on the cell type or tissue studied. At
present, only several studies have demonstrated that TSP-1
is involved in DNA damage. Guo et al reported that TSP-1
analogues induced programmed cell death in endothelial
cells, based on morphological changes, assessment
of DNA fragmentation, and internucleosomal DNA

cleavage. Intact TSP-1 also induced DNA fragmentation
in endothelial cells [22]. However, the mechanism of
DNA repair TSP-1-medicated remains obscure. There is
a report indicating that TSP-1 might stimulate reactive
oxygen species production by signal-regulatory protein-α
in ischemia reperfusion injury. Our data demonstrated that
TSP-1 could significantly increase the expression levels
of γ-H2AX and P21, which are markers of DNA DSBs in
WERI-Rb1 cells and Y79 cells. Moreover, TSP-1 might
significantly inhibit DNA NHEJ pathway, whereas it did
not affect HR events in WERI-Rb1 cells. Therefore, TSP-1
may be involved in DNA DSBs repair in RB cells.
Interestingly, TSP-1 did not affect the expression of
γ-H2AX in RKO cells, indicating that the attenuation of
the DNA DSBs repair pathway by TSP-1 was specific to
RB cells. Consistent with our hypotheses, exogenous Rb1
could attenuate the increase of γ-H2AX in WERI-Rb1 cells
after TSP-1 treatment. Thus, these results indicated that
a mutation of Rb1 might be involved in TSP-1-mediated
suppression of DNA DSBs repair. Currently, it has been
clear that the complex of the Rb1 binding transcript factor
E2F plays a crucial role in regulating transcription. Much
evidence has demonstrated that the complex of Rb1 and
E2F regulates many downstream target genes that are
involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication

[46]. However, the direct evidence of Rb1 and TSP-1 in
DNA DSBs repair has been not reported yet. One study
indicated that the suppression of TSP-1 could be achieved
by an alternative mechanism involving the inactivation of
both p53 and pRb [47]. In addition, Thrombospondin-1
signaling through CD47 inhibits self-renewal by negative
regulating c-Myc and other stem cell transcription factors,
such as, c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4, and Sox2 [48]. Therefore, we
speculate that TSP-1 is not only a matricellular protein
associated with cell migration and invasive, but also a
possible transcription factor in regulation of other genes.

There might be a complicated mechanism of TSP-1mediated DNA DSBs repair in retinoblastoma cells, which
is required to be investigated in the future.
Furthermore, it is well known that retinoblastoma
develops in the retina, which develops rapidly in early
life, and results in neural damage [42]. Some reports
have indicated that TSP-1 plays a key role in neural
development and promoting synaptic activity [24, 49–50].
Synaptic activity could suppress Puma-induced neuronal
apoptosis [28]. An increase in synaptic activity could
enhance neuronal survival [28, 29]. Compared with WT

retina, TSP-1 null retina fails to recover from the laserinduced injury, resulting in irreversible damage [51].
Moreover, TSP-1 counteracts the increased neuronal
excitability and neuronal death induced by TNFα. The role
of TSP-1 in controlling the balance between excitation
and inhibition could facilitate the recovery of normal
synaptic activity after injury [52]. Remotely activated ACs
promoted the recovery of excitatory input on surviving
motor neurons by the up-regulation of TSP-1 expression
[53]. Here, using two kinds of co-culture system, our data
showed that TSP-1 prolonged retinal neurocyte survival
and effectively inhibited the proliferation of WERI-Rb1
cells and Y79 cells. Therefore, TSP-1 might be a potent
therapeutic target for suppressing the growth of tumors
while protecting normal retina cells.
In summary, this study provided direct biochemical
and genetic evidence supporting the notion that TSP-1 is
silenced by histone demethylation in retinoblastoma cells.
Moreover, TSP-1 could significantly inhibit cell growth of
RB cells. Moreover, the expression level of γ-H2AX and
P21, well-characterized in situ markers of DNA DSBs, was
significantly decreased in RB cells. DNA NHEJ pathway
in WERI-Rb1 cells is significantly inhibited by TSP-1 too.
Therefore, our results revealed that TSP-1 is not only a
potential target gene in the treatment of retinoblastoma but
also a mechanism of TSP-1-mediated anti-retinoblastoma
effects. Thus, these findings warrant future clinical
investigations of the suppression of retinoblastoma and
neuroprotection with TSP-1 during retinal irradiation in
the pediatric population.

(Minneapolis, MN, USA). (B) Primary mice retinal
neurocytes were cultured as described previously [33].
It has been provided by the animal center of Zhongshan
Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, China (C) Coculture system cells were cultured in a transwell system
(0.4-μM pore size; BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA, USA)
in the presence or absence of 25 nM hTSP-1 for 4 days,
respectively.
Fresh tissue samples (retinoblastoma) from patients,
after diagnosis and verification by oncologists, were
obtained from Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yatsen University. All the patients included in this study
required enucleation treatment because of the massive
retinoblastoma classified as Group E or some eyes with
advanced Group D according to the IIRC (the International
Intraocular Retinoblastoma Classification). The samples
were collected after a signed consent form was obtained
from the patients or their parents/guardians. The present
study was approved and monitored by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhongshan
Ophthalmic Center, and it adhered to the provisions of
the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human
subjects.

Cell viability assayed by CCK-8
The viability of WERI-Rb1 and Y79 cells and mice
retinal neurocytes was assessed by a Cell counting Kit-8
(CCK8) assay (Dojindo, Japan). The CCK8 reagent was
added to each well and cells were incubated for 2 h at
37°C. The absorbance (optical density) at 450 nm was
measured. Cell viability was determined by the optical
density ratio of a treated culture over an untreated control
and represented by quantile normalization in log2 scale.

Real-time RT-PCR
The total RNA of cells or tissues was isolated using
TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays
were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol for
the SYBR Prime Script TM RT-PCR Kit (Takara, China).
Real-time PCR was employed to measure the expression of
TSP-1 using the Roche 480 system (Roche, USA). Relative
target gene expression was quantitated according to the
comparative ΔCT method, i.e., normalized to an endogenous
control gene, β-actin, and relative to a calibrator after
calculating the efficiency coefficient: relative expression =
2-ΔCT, where ΔCT = CT (target gene)-CT (β-actin). The
results are presented as the inverse of the normalized Ct
value (InvCt) or as the relative fold change compared with an
unstimulated control. The following primer pairs were used:

harvested and assayed after 24 h. At twenty-four hours
after transfected cells were maintained in complete RPMI
medium, CAT assays (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Western blot analysis

Immunohistofluorescence assay

Cells or tissues were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Western blotting was
carried out by standard protocols. The following primary
antibodies were used: mouse anti-TSP-1 (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA); rabbit anti-HDAC4 (Signalway
Antibody, Pearland, TX); rabbit anti-GAPDH, rabbit
anti-P21, rabbit anti-HDAC8 (Proteintech Group,
Chicago, IL); rabbit anti-acetylated histone H3, rabbit
anti-acetylated histone H3 (Lys14, 27, 56 and K18),
rabbit anti-phospho-H2AX ser-139 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA), synaptophysin (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA). Proteins were visualized with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit, antimouse IgG, (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA)
followed by use of the ECL chemiluminescence system.
Western blot data was subjected to densitometry analysis
by computerized image analysis and software (Gel-Pro
Analyzer software ver.6.0, Media Cyberetics, USA).

WERI-Rb1 cells, Y79 cells or tissue sections were
fixed in methanol and then were characterized by staining
with mouse anti-TSP-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA)
[54], synaptophysin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA
and rabbit anti-phospho-H2AX ser-139 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA), respectively. Secondary antimouse antibodies (CST, Lenexa, KS, USA) were added at
room temperature, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI.
The cells were counterstained with the fluorescent nuclearbinding label 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were
obtained by fluorescence microscopy.

Quantitative NHEJ and HR assay
Seven days after transfection of pEPI-NHEJ or pEPIHR into WERI-Rb1 cells or Y79 cells by electroporation,
the cells were treated with hTSP-1 and scrambled controls.
At twenty-four hours after treatment, pRFP–ISceI–GR
(purchased from Addgene, USA) was transfected into the
cells. To allow for ISceI expression and NHEJ or HR, the
cells were grown in full medium. If NHEJ or HR occurred,
the normal expression of GFP could be observed. The intact
pEGFP-N1 was used as the positive control, and treatment
with PBS and no plasmid was used as the negative control.
Forty-eight hours later, the cells were harvested and
subjected to two-color fluorescence analysis. The green
fluorescent cells represented the efficiency of NHEJ and
HR. For each analysis, 200,000 cells were processed.

Plasmid construction
The NHEJ reporter plasmid pEPI-NHEJ, used as
a substrate for the quantitative NHEJ assay, was derived
from pEPI-EGFP (generously provided by Dr. H.J. Lipps),
which contains a human scaffold/matrix-attached region
(S/MAR) and allows for sustained episomal replication
without chromosomal integration in human cells [35].
A 52-bp fragment containing an ISceI recognition site
and chromosomally integrated GFP-based reporter was
inserted into the unique NheI site of plasmid pEPI-EGFP.
The HR reporter plasmid pEPI-HR, used as a substrate for
the quantitative HR assay, was derived from pEPI-EGFP
and pDRGFP [30] (purchased from Addgene, USA).
The S/MAR fragment was obtained from pEPI-EGFP by
restriction digestion with BglII and EcorI. The HR fragment
was obtained by restriction digestion with SppI and AgeI.
Then two fragments were ligated with T4 Ligase. The
mitotic stability of the episomal plasmid was determined
by quantifying the copy number of the episomal plasmid
using real time PCR analysis of extrachromosomal plasmid
extracted up to 35 days after transfection.
The plasmid pEPI-GFP-Rb1 was derived from
pEPI-GFP [35], which human Rb1 cDNA was inserted in
pEPI-GFP by restrictional digested sites, KpnI and BamHI.

Cell cycle assay
WERI-Rb1 cells or Y79 cells were harvested,
fixed with 75% ice-cold ethanol in PBS and kept at 4°C.
Prior to analysis, cells were washed twice with PBS and
then incubated for 30 min in a propidium iodide staining
solution containing 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, 1 mM
ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.1% Triton
X-100™ and 1 mg/ml ribonuclease A (RNase A) (all
from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri). The staining
fluorescence intensity was measured using a cytomics
FC500 MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Inc, USA)
and used to determine the G1/M ratio.

Assessment of apoptosis
WERI-Rb1 cells or Y79 cells were harvested and
then stained with Annexin V and PI using fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Annexin V and PI
(Annexin-V-PI Kit, Roche, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. Apoptosis was quantified

TSP-1 promoter-reporter assay
In each transfection, 2×106 WERI-Rb1 cellsor Y79
cells were electroporated with 10 μg of -2033/+750 human
TSP-1 promoter CAT (Addgene, USA). The cells were

Murine xenograft model of retinoblastoma

This work was supported by the grant from the
National Natural Science Foundation (Project: 81170850).

The experimental procedures were approved through
the Ethical Committee of Sun Yat-sen University (2014007).
Swiss background nu/nu mice were obtained from the
Center of Experimental Animals of Sun Yat-sen University
and were kept in a conventional environment in cages with
filter tops. The WERI-Rb1 cells were re-suspended as a
single-cell suspension in PBS. Using a Hamilton needle,
2×105 WERI-Rb1 cells were injected into the vitreous
space of the right eyes of nude mice under sterile conditions
using a dissecting microscope; the left eyes were used as
untreated controls. The mice were observed weekly for
tumor development. Two weeks after cell implantation,
the nude mice were randomized (6 mice for each group)
to a treatment group receiving vitreous injections two
times per week of 2 μl of hTSP-1 at a dose of 2 μM or to a
control groups receiving balanced salt solution. All of the
animals underwent serial ophthalmologic examinations. At
day 30 after Weri-Rb1 cell implantation, the globes were
enucleated rand fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h.
They were then were processed into paraffin-embedded
sections, and sequential meridian sections (5 μm thick) were
creating through the optic disc. The sections were stained
with H&E (hematoxylin and eosin).
