BACKGROUND: In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the association of measurable
tumor responses with overall survival (OS) is unknown. The authors retrospectively evaluated the TAX327 phase 3
trial to study this relation. METHODS: Eligible patients for this analysis included those with World Health Organization
(WHO)-defined measurable metastatic disease randomized to receive either docetaxel or mitoxantrone. OS was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the prognostic relation of WHO-defined radiologic response with OS
was performed by using Cox proportional hazards regression. Landmark analyses evaluated survival from baseline
and at 2, 3, 4, and 6 months after baseline. RESULTS: Four hundred twelve patients enrolled on the TAX327 trial had
measurable tumors. Thirty-seven patients exhibited a complete or partial objective response (CR/PR, 9.0%), 116 had
stable disease (SD, 28.2%), 99 had progressive disease (PD, 24%) and 160 (38.8%) did not have a after-baseline
objective assessment. Partial responders demonstrated longer median OS (29.0 months) than patients with SD (22.1
months) or those with PD (10.8 months) or those who were not assessed (12.7 months). These results remained after
landmark analysis. The authors found a significant association between 30% prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
declines and radiologic response, with 30% PSA declines occurring in all patients with CR/PR, 79.8% of patients
with SD, and 34.4% with PD. Radiologic response remained a significant but modest post-treatment prognostic factor
for OS after adjusting for treatment, pain response, and 30% PSA decline (P ¼ .009). CONCLUSIONS: In men with
metastatic CRPC and measurable disease receiving chemotherapy, objective tumor response was prognostic for OS

KEYWORDS: castration-resistant prostate cancer, measurable disease, WHO response, PSA response, overall survival.

The determination of objective response to therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
is plagued by the presence of nonmeasurable bony metastatic disease in the majority of patients who are beginning chemotherapy.1,2 Retrospective studies of the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)-9916 and the TAX327 trials, which compared docetaxel-based with mitoxantrone-based chemotherapy, demonstrated that a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
decline 30% or 50% within 3 months had a moderate degree of surrogacy for extended overall survival (OS) in the setting of cytotoxic chemotherapy.3,4 Retrospective analyses of these trials have also demonstrated that an increase in PSA at
3 months correlates with poor overall survival (OS).5,6 A recent retrospective study demonstrated that progression-free
survival (PFS), defined by a composite endpoint (progression by bone scan, PSA criteria by PSA working group, and
measurable tumor progression), also correlates with poorer OS.7 However, assessment of bone-scan progression may be
hampered by the bone healing or flare response, and PSA progression may not apply in the setting of biologic agents.8
Tumor progression may not be optimally reflected by clinical progression (pain progression or skeletal events).9 Although
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and functional imaging are emerging as promising surrogates for clinical outcomes, further
validation is required, and their role in clinical decisions is unclear.10-12

An inexpensive, readily available and objectively
measured clinical parameter that enhances the ability to
predict enhanced OS is desirable. A small, but substantial
proportion, of men have measurable soft tissue, lymph
node, or visceral metastasis. Although objective evaluation
of measurable soft tissue or visceral disease is feasible, the
correlation of objective responses with long-term outcomes is unclear.13-15 Measurable tumor response may
complement and enhance the power of PSA decline and/
or pain improvement as an intermediate surrogate for
long-term outcomes.4,16 We, therefore, conducted a retrospective study of the TAX327 trial to identify a potential association between measurable tumor responses
(with or without PSA decline) and OS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population in the TAX327 Trial and
Eligibility for Retrospective Analysis
The TAX327 trial was a randomized 3-arm trial of 1006
men that compared first-line docetaxel-prednisone every
3 weeks (D3W), weekly docetaxel-prednisone (DW),
or mitoxantrone-prednisone (MP) every 3 weeks in
patients with progressive metastatic CRPC. Patients were
recruited from March 2000 through June 2002 after institutional internal review board approval at participating
institutions.1,17 Eligible men had metastatic prostatic
adenocarcinoma and evidence of progression despite
androgen-deprivation therapy defined clinically or by radiographic or PSA criteria. Treatment was continued for
up to 30 weeks or until toxicity, progression, or death.
Imaging studies were performed at intervals of 6 to 9
weeks and repeated after 4 weeks to identify those with a
response. For patients with at least 1 bidimensionally
measurable lesion, tumor response was evaluated by
World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, for which
the product of the largest diameter and its perpendicular
are summed for predefined lesions.18 Four WHO
response categories are defined: complete response (CR),
partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive
disease (PD). CR requires disappearance of all known disease, PR is a 50% decrease in tumor area, and PD is
25% increase in area or the appearance of 1 new
lesion, each maintained for at least 2 successive evaluations. A PSA response was defined as a reduction from
baseline of 50% that was maintained for 3 weeks, a
pain response was defined as a 2-point reduction in the
present pain index (PPI) score from baseline without an
increase in the analgesic score or as a reduction of 50%

3964

in the analgesic score without an increase in the PPI score,
either of which was maintained for 3 weeks. To be eligible for the current retrospective analysis, patients were
required to have measurable tumors at baseline according
to WHO criteria. The present analysis includes updated
survival data that includes information on 867 deaths
known to have occurred by March 2007.17
Statistical Considerations
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS. As it
is possible that there may be a time bias related to objective response status, and because date of response was not
recorded (ie, only best objective response while on study
was recorded), a landmark analysis was performed at 60,
90, 120, and 180 days after baseline.19 In essence, this
resets the baseline date to the landmark date, and data
analysis is performed from that point forward. Responses
by WHO criteria (CR, PR, SD, PD, or not evaluable
[NE]) were assessed as categorical variables because degree
of tumor shrinkage was not available. The chi-square test
was used to test for associations between tumor response
and other outcomes of interest, such as PSA decline and
pain response, as well as baseline prognostic factors of interest, such as risk groups and presence of metastases in
bone, liver, and lymph nodes.8,20,21 Best overall response
was assessed as a prognostic factor for OS by using Cox
proportional hazards regression. For the multivariate
model, only patients who were evaluable for pain response,
30% PSA decline, and objective tumor response were
included (ie, n ¼ 168 for OS from baseline and n ¼ 120
for OS from day 180). All models included stratification
factors for baseline pain and Karnofsky performance status
in accordance with the initial analysis. Assessment of objective tumor response as a potential surrogate for OS was performed by using the likelihood reduction factor (LRF) on
the full model.22 The LRF is a measure of the effect of the
prognostic factor (ie, tumor objective response status) on
the outcome (ie, OS) and is measured on a scale from 0
to 1. Although no definitive guidelines exist, an optimal
surrogate will have an LRF close to 1.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of 1006 patients enrolled in the TAX327 trial, 412
(41%) patients were evaluable at baseline for objective
tumor response assessment (Table 1), 369 of whom had
died as of the updated dataset in March 2007. These
patients were evenly distributed among the 3 treatment

Association of Objective Responses
With Survival
The 594 patients who were inevaluable (IE) for response
had longer median OS (19.2 months vs 15.3 months) and
were more likely to have censored survival data (16.2% vs
10.4%) than response evaluable patients. Of patients
evaluable for tumor response, those with an objective
response had longer median survival from baseline (29.0
months) than those with stable disease (22.1 months),
who in turn had longer survival than those patients with
either PD (10.8 months) or NE disease (12.7 months;
Fig. 1a and b). For D3W patients only, median survival
from baseline was 29.0, 23.4, 12.9, 13.1 months for CR/
PR (n ¼ 17), SD (n ¼ 40), PD (n ¼ 26), and NE (n ¼
58) patients, respectively. This corresponds to hazards
ratios of 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.86;
P ¼ .016), 0.48 (95% CI, 0.30-0.77; P ¼ .003), and 1.45
(95% CI, 0.89-2.38; P ¼ .14) for D3W patients with
CR/PR, SD, and PD, respectively compared with NE
patients. There was no significant difference in OS among
patients having CR/PR between the different treatment
groups (P ¼ .96). Results were very similar at each landmark time; thus, only OS from baseline and at 180 days
are discussed.

Association of Objective Response With
PSA Response and Pain Response
There was a statistically significant association (P < .001)
between objective tumor response and 30% and 50%
PSA declines (Table 3). There were 361 patients evaluable
for both PSA and objective tumor measurements. Of
these patients, all 32 patients who had an objective tumor
response also had a confirmed 30% PSA reduction
within 3 months (all 32 patients also had PSA reductions
of 50%; however, a confirmatory 50% PSA measurement occurred in only 31 of these 32 patients). In addition, confirmatory 30% PSA reductions were observed
in 79 of 99 (79.8%) patients with objective SD, 31 of 90
(34.4%) patients with objective PD, and 28 of 140
(20.0%) of NE patients. Similar results were observed
when employing confirmed 50% reduction in PSA,
with 31 of 32 (96.9%) of CR/PR patients, 69 of 99
(69.7%) of SD patients, 22 of 90 (24.4%) of PD patients,
and 21 of 140 (15.0%) of NE patients having a PSA
response. The sole patient with an objective tumor
response without a confirmed PSA response attained a

more than 3 weeks later. Objective tumor response was

20 of 43 (46.5%) of SD patients, 11 of 55 (20.0%) of PD

3 categories of response (pain, PSA, and objective), only 4
attained all of these responses, indicating the relative rarity
of this event.

Predictive Factors for Objective Response
A recent analysis of the same TAX327 trial identified the
following 4 factors as predictive for 30% PSA declines
and OS: baseline pain, visceral metastases, anemia, and
progression by new bone-scan lesions at baseline.23 Based
on these factors, 3 risk groups were identified with different outcomes: good (0-1 factors), intermediate (2 factors),
and poor (3-4 factors). These risk groups were also significantly associated with objective tumor response and
tumor nonprogression (P < .001, for both). Objective
response rate and tumor nonprogression rate were 23 of
128 (18.0%) and 65 of 128 (50.8%) for the good prognosis group, 9 of 136 (6.6%) and 46 of 136 (33.8%) for the
intermediate prognosis group, and 5 of 148 (3.4%) and
42 of 148 (28.4%) in the poor prognosis group. Among
D3W patients only, the objective response and tumor
nonprogression rates were 10 of 46 (21.7%) and 25 of 46
(54.4%), 6 of 48 (12.5%) and 17 of 48 (35.4%), and 1 of
47 (6.7%) and 15 of 47 (31.9%), for the good, intermediate, and poor prognosis groups, respectively. The median
OS demonstrated a substantial divergence for patients
based on tumor response status and risk group (Fig. 2a).
The possibility of differential objective response
based on the presence of concurrent bone metastasis was
studied. There were 342 patients eligible for objective
response assessment with bone metastases present at

baseline, whereas 70 patients did not have bone metastases. No patient with bone metastasis at baseline had a CR,
24 (7.0%) patients had a PR, and 86 (25.2%) patients
had SD. Seventy patients evaluable for objective response
did not have bone metastases at baseline, of whom 3
(4.3%) had a CR, 10 (14.3%) had a PR, and 30 (42.9%)
had SD. Thus, both a favorable risk group and lack of
bone metastases at baseline appeared to predict objective
tumor response, and all 3 of these variables were independently prognostic for OS (Fig. 2b). In addition, the
Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-2 recommended prognostic groups also appeared to predict for
objective responses; those with lymph node only metastasis, bone plus lymph node, and those with visceral metastasis demonstrated responses in 23.8%, 8.9%, and 5.2%,
respectively (Table 3).8
Combinations of Objective, PSA, and Pain
Responses as Prognostic Factors for Survival
The final multivariate model included only patients who
were evaluable for pain response, 30% PSA decline, and
objective tumor response (ie, n ¼ 168 for OS from baseline and n ¼ 120 for OS from day 180). Objective tumor
response (P ¼ .018), pain response (P ¼ .004), and
30% PSA declines (P ¼ .0012) were all independently
significant prognostic factors for OS (Table 4). Objective
tumor response remained a significant but modest posttreatment prognostic factor for OS after adjusting for

treatment, pain response, and 30% PSA decline (P ¼
.009). However, when studying the 168 patients eligible
at baseline for evaluating all 3 types of response (15% of
the total population studied), the LRF for the impact of
objective tumor response on OS improvement ranged
from 0.08-0.17.
Patients who did not achieve an objective tumor
response, 30% PSA decline, or pain response had the
shortest median survival of only 6.8 months from baseline
(Table 5). In comparison, the median survival from baseline of patients with both objective tumor response and
30% PSA declines was the longest at 29.0 months (95%
CI, 19.7-39.5). When examining OS based on objective
tumor PD versus non-PD, those with non-PD (n ¼ 153)
demonstrated a median OS from baseline of 22.4 months
(Table 5). Patients with both non-PD and 30% PSA
declines (n ¼ 111) demonstrated a median OS of 23.0
months. Pain response did not appear to be associated
with an extension of survival in patients with non-PD.
There were 31 patients who had a best objective response
of PD, yet achieved a 30% reduction in PSA. All 31 had
bone metastases at baseline, 29 had lymph node metastases, and 30 had soft tissue disease, while only 3 and 10
patients, respectively, had liver and visceral metastases. Of
these 31 men, 29 are known to have died, and median
survival from baseline was 14.1 months (95% CI, 11.015.8). Of note, bone-scan progression was not evaluated
separately from the overall WHO criteria in this trial to

accurately assess for bone-scan flare. In contrast, 59 men
(58 known to have died) had a best objective response of
PD and failed to achieve a 30% PSA response. The median survival from baseline of these 59 men was 9.4 (95%
CI, 5.6-11.6) months.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating an
association between objective tumor response and OS in
the setting of modern chemotherapy for metastatic
CRPC. This retrospective analysis of the TAX327 trial
identified an association of objective tumor responses by
WHO criteria and favorable survival. Those exhibiting
both WHO responses and 30% PSA declines demon-

strated the best median OS (29 months), whereas those
with 30% PSA decline without objective responses
demonstrated a median OS of 20.4 months. We also
noted improved survival among patients who achieved
SD radiologically as their best response, which has important prognostic and treatment implications for the clinic.
The proportion of patients with measurable tumors may
be higher with improved computerized tomography (CT)
technology and after administration of docetaxel, eg, in
the recent trial comparing second-line cabazitaxel versus
mitoxantrone, the proportion of patients with measurable
disease was >50%.24 Therefore, the use of objective tumor response as a signal of activity may increase as a function of optimized radiographic imaging and in more
heavily pretreated settings. Moreover, the evaluation of
objective response entails no additional costs in addition
to routine CT imaging, whereas CTCs or functional
imaging incur substantial additional costs. However, we
recognize that the lack of measurable disease in the

majority of men with metastatic CRPC will limit the use
of radiographic response as a surrogate and that the major
clinical use of this assessment will be for prognostic purposes and in the early assessment of efficacy among men
with measurable disease. A higher proportion of patients
with objective responses in addition to PSA declines may
provide a signal of better antitumor activity in the context
of cytotoxic agents. Therefore, these data may assist in
screening the activity of new cytotoxic agents in phase 2
trials through the use of composite measures of response
(pain, PSA, radiologic, and circulating tumor cell alterations for example).11
These data are consistent with those for other metastatic solid tumors that have been used to evaluate the relation between objective response and either OS or PFS.25-27
Conversely, a retrospective study of 124 men with metastatic CRPC treated on 3 different protocols elicited the
difficulties of categorizing changes in the individual sites
of disease into a CR, PR, or SD, which were thought to
render the best overall response parameter of limited
value.15 For noncytotoxic agents (ie, antiangiogenic
agents, immunologic agents, cytostatic targeted therapies), the relation between radiographic response, PFS,
and OS is unknown at this time in CRPC. While all
patients with measurable tumors and objective responses
exhibited PSA declines, only a proportion of patients with
PSA declines exhibited objective responses. Objective
responses appeared to indicate a better quality of response
translating to better OS. Intriguingly, a small subset of 31
patients that exhibited PSA declines 30% coupled with
PD of measurable tumors demonstrated a median survival

of 14.5 months. Notably, progression by composite criteria including objective progression has been found to
predict OS.7 Future studies employing current Prostate
Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-2 criteria may be better
able to evaluate this issue.8 The clinical relevance of
responses in small-volume measurable disease in the
context of large-volume bony metastatic disease may be
questioned. However, objective responses appear to be
associated with better OS with or without underlying
bone metastasis, although absolute survival is shorter in
those with bone metastasis. Those with no bone metastasis
had a higher chance of objective response, and such responders displayed the best median survival of approximately 41 months (Fig. 2b).
Limitations of this retrospective analysis include
response evaluation by WHO criteria, not RECIST.28,29
The TAX327 trial employed WHO criteria (see methods)
for the objective evaluation of responses and was conducted before the widespread adoption of RECIST criteria. The date of first objective response was not captured;
hence, a time bias is still possible, even though extensive
landmark analysis was performed and no time bias was
detectable. Only grouped response was measured (ie, CR/
PR/SD/PD) and not percentage of tumor shrinkage—
hence some details may be lost. However, the measurement of percentage declines in dimensions (employed
extensively in the setting of antiangiogenic agents for renal
cell carcinoma) is still not widely adopted, especially in
the setting of cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is unclear
whether examining percentage declines in tumor size will
better discriminate between outcomes in the setting of

chemotherapy for metastatic CRPC, although this may be
an appropriate issue to evaluate in a more modern trial
where these parameters may be available and measurable
disease more prevalent using modern CT imaging. The
category of SD is defined according to older WHO criteria and consists of a heterogeneous group of patients
because the absolute percentage increase or decrease in
size and the duration of SD are not captured in this database. Although we have examined categories of objective
response or progression, we were unable to evaluate the
surrogate association of time to objective progression or
radiographic progression-free survival with OS given the
high degree of censoring in this trial postprogression and
the definition of progression in TAX327, which included
PSA measures. At the time of conduct of the TAX327
trial, no effective second-line agents were available, which
probably enhanced our ability to detect an association
between objective response and OS. In the current era, the
availability of effective second-line chemotherapy (cabazitaxel) and immunotherapy (sipuleucel-T), which yields
delayed survival benefits, may confound the association
between response to a front-line cytotoxic agent and survival. A limited number of all men (412 of 1006, 41%)
enrolled on the TAX327 trial had measurable disease and
were eligible for this analysis, and 160 (38.8%) of these
men were not evaluable because of removal or censorship
from trial before objective evaluation or confirmatory
radiologic evaluation. The censorship in this trial and in
many other phase 3 studies as well as the lack of measurable disease at baseline in many men with CRPC reduce
the performance and generalizability of radiographic
response as an effective broad surrogate of OS. Furthermore, the 594 patients who were inevaluable at baseline
for objective response had longer median OS (19.2
months vs 15.3 months; Table 1), suggesting that patients
with measurable tumors may have biologically more
aggressive disease. Thus, as a stand-alone endpoint, radiographic response cannot be recommended as a primary
endpoint in phase 2 or 3 trials in CRPC. Finally, the total
number of patients with an objective response was small
(37 of 412 evaluable, or 9.0%, and only 3.7% of all 1006
patients entered on the TAX327 trial). The assessment of
surrogacy is limited by the small number of patients (n ¼
168) evaluable for all 3 categories of response (pain, PSA,
and objective), and because percentage tumor shrinkage
was not captured, and WHO response criteria were used
and not RECIST. However, its association with OS outcomes suggests the utility of radiologic response along
with other criteria in the selection of cytotoxic agents.

To conclude, in men with metastatic CRPC and
measurable disease receiving chemotherapy, objective tumor response was prognostic for OS and appears to complement PSA and pain responses in the assessment of patient
benefit over time. The validation of our findings in a separate dataset in the frontline as well as second-line setting is
warranted, particularly in a large sample of patients with
measurable disease, given that measurable tumors are being
detected more commonly with current radiologic technology and criteria. With validation, objective responses may
help expedite drug development by assisting in identifying
more promising agents in screening phase 2 trials.
