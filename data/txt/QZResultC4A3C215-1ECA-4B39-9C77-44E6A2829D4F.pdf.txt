BACKGROUND: Biliary tract adenocarcinoma (BTA) is an uncommon tumor with a poor prognosis and no standard,
systemic chemotherapy. The combined cisplatin, epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and gemcitabine (PEFG) regimen is an
effective, upfront treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. In this study, the authors assessed the activity and
safety of this combination regimen in patients with advanced BTA. METHODS: PEFG (cisplatin 40 mg/m2 and epirubicin 40 mg/m2 on Day 1; gemcitabine 600 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8; and 5-fluorouracil [FU] 200 mg/m2 daily as a
continuous infusion) was administered to chemotherapy-naive patients who had a cytologic or histologic diagnosis
of locally advanced or metastatic BTA, aged 75 years, and a performance status (PS) >60 either until they had evidence progressive disease or for a maximum of 6 months. Tumor size was assessed every 2 months during treatment.
RESULTS: Between May 1999 and December 2005, 37 patients (62% metastatic) who had a median age of 62 years
and a median PS of 90 received the PEFG regimen at the authors’ institution. Primary tumor sites were the intrahepatic bile duct in 10 patients (27%), the extrahepatic bile duct in 8 patients (22%), the gallbladder in 12 patients
(32%), and the ampulla of Vater in 7 patients (19%). A partial response was observed in 16 patients (43%), and stable
disease was observed in 12 patients (32%). The median overall survival (OS) was 12.1 months, and the 1-year OS rate
was 52%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.9 months, and the 6-month PFS rate was 67%. The main
grade 3/4 toxicity was neutropenia in 18% of cycles followed by thrombocytopenia in 9% of cycles, nausea/vomiting
in 5% of cycles, and febrile neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, and stomatitis in 2% of cycles. CONCLUSIONS: The current
results demonstrated that PEFG was an active regimen with a manageable toxicity profile for patients with advanced

Biliary tract adenocarcinoma (BTA) is an uncommon tumor with a poor prognosis and a median survival that rarely

exceeds 6 months. Although surgical resection is a potentially curative therapy, <25% of patients are resectable at presentation; and, among those patients, the recurrence rate are high.1 Glimelius et al2 demonstrated an improvement of quality
of life for patients with BTA who received 5-fluorouracil (FU)-based chemotherapy versus best supportive care. However,
no standard chemotherapy has been identified that clearly can prolong survival.
Fluoropyrimidines have been considered the basis of palliative chemotherapy despite a low response rate (range, 0%10%).3-5 In a few recent phase 2 trials that investigated different chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine, platinum
analogs, S1, exatecan, irinotecan, fluoropyrimidines, and mitomycin C, an objective response rate (ORR) ranging from
5% to 35% with a median survival of 5 to 8 months was reported.6-16 Some of these drugs seem to be more active in combination because of synergic, additive mechanisms that were demonstrated in preclinical studies.17-20 Different combination chemotherapy regimens containing gemcitabine, anthracyclines, platinum analogs, S1, fluoropyrimidines, and
mitomycin C reportedly produced ORRs between 15% and 45%, a median survival of 6 to 11 months, and a 1-year survival rate that ranged from 20% to 40%.21-37
The combined regimen of cisplatin, epirubicin, FU, and gemcitabine (PEFG) is an effective, upfront treatment for
advanced pancreatic cancer.38,39 Because this combination regimen contains the most active drugs commonly

administered in the therapeutic approach of biliary tract
cancer, we decided to assess its activity against BTA. The
results of this study are reported.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
The PEFG regimen was administered to chemotherapynaive patients aged <76 years who had a Karnofsky performance status (PS) >60; cytologically or histologically
proven, locally advanced or metastatic BTA; measurable
lesions on computed tomography; and adequate bone
marrow (absolute neutrophil count 1500 cells/mm3;
platelet count 100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin
10 g/dL), kidney function (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/
dL), and liver function (serum total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL
and serum transaminase levels 3 times the upper limit of
laboratory normal). This trial was approved by an internal
review board. All participating patients were required to
provide written informed consent.
Treatment Plan
The PEFG regimen consisted of 40 mg/m2 cisplatin (Cisplatino-TEVA; Pharmachemie BV, Haarlem, the Netherlands) and 40 mg/m2 epirubicin (Farmarubicina;
Pharmacia & Upjohn SpA, Milan, Italy) given intravenously on Day 1, 600 mg/m2 gemcitabine (Gemzar; Eli
Lilly, Fegersheim, France) given over 1 hour on Days 1
and 8, and 200 mg/m2 FU (Fluorouracile-TEVA; Pharmachemie BV) on Days 1 through 28 as a protracted infusion for the duration of chemotherapy by using an
indwelling, implanted central venous catheter. Cycles
were repeated every 28 days for a maximum of 6 cycles or
until there was evidence of either unacceptable side effects
or progressive disease (PD). Hydration, antiemetic treatment, drug dilution, and guidelines for dose reduction
and treatment delay have been reported previously.38,39
Study Evaluations
Assessment of disease, including CA 19.9 measurement
and computed tomography studies of the abdomen and
chest, was done at baseline, every 6 to 8 weeks during
chemotherapy, and every 3 months thereafter or if clinical
PD was suspected. Complete blood, platelet, and differential counts were obtained every week, and a biochemistry
profile was obtained each month. Patients who had at
least 1 measurable indicator lesion according to World
Health Organization criteria were assessable for response
evaluation.40 Responses were confirmed by computed to-

mography studies at least 6 weeks later. Toxicity was
graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0).41 Progression-free
survival (PFS) was calculated as the interval between the
initiation of treatment and the occurrence of PD or death,
and overall survival (OS) was measured from the initiation of treatment to the date of death or the last follow-up
assessment.
Statistical Design
Because this was an observational study, no statistical
design was used. Descriptive analyses of toxicity, response
rate, PFS, and OS are reported. In univariate analyses, survival curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier
method and were compared by using the log-rank test. All
probability values were determined from 2-sided tests.
Analyses were done with the Statistica 4.0 statistical package for Microsoft Windows.

RESULTS
Efficacy and Activity Analyses
Between May 1999 and December 2005, 37 consecutive
patients at a single institution received the PEFG regimen.
Patients’ characteristics are summarized in Table 1. One
hundred eighty-three courses of chemotherapy (range,
1-8, courses per patient; median, 6 courses per patient)
were administered. Therapy was discontinued before
completion in 15 patients, including 9 patients who had
radiologic PD, 2 patients who had clinical PD, 2 patients
who refused to continue chemotherapy, 1 patient who
discontinued treatment because of toxicity, and 1 patient
who had stage III disease and became resectable after 4
chemotherapy cycles and underwent curative surgery.
Table 2 and Figure 1 summarize the outcome measures. Sixteen patients (43%) obtained a partial response
with a median duration of 6.8 months (range, 2.2-70
months). A partial response was observed in 6 of 7
patients who had cancer of the ampulla of Vater, in 4 of
12 patients who had gallbladder cancer, and in 6 of 18
who had cancer of the bile duct. Twelve patients (32%)
had stable disease with a median duration of 6.2 months
(range, 3.1-27 months). Nine patients had PD. Twentyfive patients (67%) had a basal CA 19-9 concentration
that was over normal limits. A CA 19-9 concentration
that was decreased 50% from baseline was observed in
13 of 25 patients (52%), including 6 patients (24%) who
had had a decrease 90%.

detected. The median OS was 10.7 months for patients
with a CA 19-9 reduction 50% from baseline and 6.5
months for patients without a reduction 50% (P ¼ .40).
Patients with a CA 19-9 reduction at nadir 90% had significantly better OS than patients with a CA 19-9 reduction between 50% and 89% (median OS, 14.8 months vs
8.1 months; P ¼ .01). Among 16 patients who had a partial
response to chemotherapy, 9 patients (56%) had basal CA
19-9 values >1.0 times the upper normal limit on at least 1
follow-up CA 19-9 measurement. In these patients, an
increased CA 19-9 value or a decrease <50% was observed
in 3 patients, a decrease between 50% and 89% was
observed in 2 patients, and a decrease >89% was observed
in 4 patients. Among 12 patients who had stable disease, 7
patients (58%) had basal CA 19-9 values >1.0 times the
upper normal limit on at least 1 follow-up CA 19-9 measurement. In these patients, an increased CA 19-9 value or
a decrease <50% was observed in 2 patients, a decrease
between 50% and 89% was observed in 3 patients, and a
decrease >89% was observed in 2 patients. Among 9
patients who had PD, 7 patients (77%) had basal CA 19-9
values >1.0 times the upper normal limit on at least 1 follow-up CA 19-9 measurement. All of these patients had
increased CA 19-9 values or had a decrease <50%.

cin, 4 patients received PEFG, 3 patients received gemcitabine and FU, and 1 patient received gemcitabine alone)
without obtaining any radiologic response. The median
time from progression to death was 5.8 months for
patients who received salvage therapy and 5 months for
patients who did not receive second-line therapy.
Safety and Toxicity
Table 4 summarizes the main hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities that were observed. Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity consisted of neutropenia in 18% of cycles,
febrile neutropenia and anemia in 2% of cycles, and
thrombocytopenia in 9% of cycles. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicity consisted of nausea and vomiting in 5% of
cycles, stomatitis and fatigue in 2% of cycles, and diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, and pulmonary edema in 1%
of cycles.
Growth factors were received for 1 to 3 days by 2
patients for 6 cycles (3%). Erythrocyte and platelet transfusions were received by 2 patients for 3 cycles and by 1
patient for 1 cycle, respectively. Erythropoietin was
received by 4 patients. No treatment-related deaths were
observed.

DISCUSSION
The current results demonstrated that the PEFG regimen
was active in the treatment of biliary tract cancer and

produced a 43% response rate and an additional stable
disease rate of 32%, for an overall disease control rate of
75%. Fifty-two percent of patients had a 50% decrease
in CA 19-9 concentration compared with baseline, 19%
of patients had a PFS >12 months, and the median survival was 12.1 months. These results compare favorably
with reported ORRs between 10% and 45%22,27-33 and a
median survival between 8 months and 11 months22,27-33
observed in the majority of reported clinical trials that
included 2-drug combinations. The role of chemotherapy
in advanced biliary tract cancer remains to be defined, and
no standard regimen has been identified. Furthermore,
neither prognostic nor predictive factors for response to
chemotherapy have been recognized. In our exploratory
analysis, we were unable to identify individual candidate
factors other than disease site as predictors of response to
chemotherapy. The results suggest that cancer of the
ampulla of Vater is more responsive to treatment. However, the sample size of each subgroup was too small to
allow reliable conclusions. In our series, changes in serum
CA 19-9 concentration were correlated with radiologic
findings and OS. A major biochemical response (ie, a
reduction 90% in CA 19-9 concentration at nadir compared with the baseline value) appeared to correlate with
to better OS in biliary tract cancer, as we observed previously in pancreatic cancer.42 Clinical trials are difficult to
perform because of the relative rarity and heterogeneity of
these tumors and because of the patient population. In the
last 22 years, there were >100 clinical trials, including
only 2 phase 2 randomized trials10,33 and 1 phase 3 trial,36
with a mean of 25 patients per trial and with limited sample sizes in various disease subgroups.17 Comparisons
across trials are difficult because of the heterogeneity of

2212

the patient populations and the inclusion criteria. In consideration of these limitations and the observational nature of the current study, our findings should be
considered with caution, and definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. Nevertheless, the current survey provides
interesting observations and may contribute to debate on
the optimal therapeutic management in BTA. A wide
range of response rates and OS data was reported in different clinical trials using a regimen of epirubicin, cisplatin,
and FU (ORR 10%-40%; median OS, 5-11
months).25,35-37 Combinations of gemcitabine plus either
oxaliplatin or capecitabine22,32 yielded an ORRs from
31% to 33% and a median PFS of 5.7 to 7 months. The
PEFG regimen produced better ORR and PFS with
respect to all of those combinations, suggesting the contribution of each single agent in improving antitumor activity. Conversely, the median OS reportedly was better on
gemcitabine-based combinations with respect to the 4drug regimen (14-15.4 months vs 12.1 months).22,32
However, OS data are particularly difficult to interpret
because of the different patient populations and the possible impact of salvage therapy that was not described in
those trials.22,32 Furthermore, the impact of 3-drug or 4drug chemotherapy regimens on ORR and PFS has only
been suggested.17
Our current results confirm that the PEFG regimen
is a manageable and safe regimen, as reported previously
in advanced pancreatic cancer.38,39 Episodes of grade 3
and 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, albeit common, were not complicated and did not require hospitalization. Conversely, nonhematologic toxicity appears to be
less frequent with the PEFG regimen compared
with other gemcitabine-based regimens (hand-foot
syndrome, 3% vs 9%; peripheral neuropathy, 0% vs
7%-14%).6,22,28,31,32 In pancreatic cancer, a modified
PEFG regimen produced reductions in hospital admissions and toxicity without compromising activity.43,44
The regimen’s manageability and patient compliance may
be improved further by substituting FU with oral fluoropyrimidines, which can overcome catheter-related risks
without compromising treatment activity.45,46
Despite the observational nature of this study, the
PEFG regimen appears to have interesting activity against
BTA with manageable toxicity, which may be improved
further with the modified schedule that is used in pancreatic cancer.43-45 In the absence of evidence-based treatment guidelines, this regimen may represent a therapeutic
option for the management of patients with biliary tract
cancer.
