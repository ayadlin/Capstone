ABSTRACT
Clinical treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) thus far encounters a huge challenge
due to oxaliplatin-resistance. As crucial rate-limiting enzymes in aerobic glycolysis
and glutaminolysis, pyruvate kinase M2 type (PKM2) and kidney-type glutaminase
(GLS1) are proposed to carry important implications in colorectal carcinogenesis and
drug-resistance. This study aimed to explore the possible association of oxaliplatinresistance with aerobic glycolysis/glutaminolysis indexed by PKM2/GLS1 expression.
PKM2 and GLS1 expression was quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
Western blot techniques in CRC cell lines. The abilities of cell formation, kinetics,
migration, invasion, survival and apoptosis, as well as permeability glycoprotein (Pgp)
expression were inspected before and after knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression.
In addition, the influence of knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression was evaluated
in vivo. Differentiated PKM2 and GLS1 expression in both THC8307 and THC8307/
Oxa cell lines was identified. In the THC8307 cell line, PKM2 and GLS1 can accelerate
malignant behaviors, increase oxaliplatin-resistance, upregulate Pgp expression,
and inhibit cell apoptosis. Contrastingly in the THC8307/Oxa cell line, knockdown
of PKM2/GLS1 expression can restrain malignant behaviors, reestablish oxaliplatinsensitivity, downregulate Pgp expression, and induce cell apoptosis. In xenograft,
knockdown of PKM2/GLS1 expression can significantly inhibit tumor growth, reduce
Pgp expression, and increase tumor apoptosis. Taken together, the present findings
enriched our knowledge by demonstrating a significant association of PKM2 and GLS1
with oxaliplatin-resistance in CRC. We further propose that knockdown of PKM2/GLS1
expression may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy toward effective treatment
for CRC.

understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying
chemotherapy resistance of oxaliplatin is still poor
[4–7].
It is widely recognized that some alterations are
necessitated for cancer cells to adapt in response to
chemotherapeutic stress for survival [8]. Also, there are
several existing contributors to oxaliplatin-resistance,
and ATP is persistently involved in almost all processes
[9]. For instance, Zhou et al. reported that intracellular
ATP concentration was a critical determinant of
chemoresistance of oxaliplatin in colon cancer cells
[10]. Chemotherapy sensitivity of drug-resistant cells

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most
common cancer around the world. Globally, over 1
million people are newly diagnosed to develop CRC
per annum [1]. In China, the incidence of CRC is
rapidly escalating, especially in underdeveloped areas
[2]. Currently, oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is a
chief therapeutic strategy for CRC, and it receives an
intense attention in the medical literature [3]. However,
oxaliplatin-resistance thus far poses a huge challenge
for CRC treatment in routine clinical practice, and the

could be elevated after consuming ATP. In contrast,
chemotherapy resistance of drug-sensitive cells might
be augmented after supplying exogenetic ATP [10].
Generally, there are two major sources of ATP in tumor
cells: aerobic glycolysis and glutamine metabolism [11].
For aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate kinase (PK) is a key
kinase, and PKM2 is one of PK’s four isoforms. PKM2
is proposed to play a key role in cancer metabolism and
account for the “Warburg” effect [12]. Experimental
data are accumulating suggesting that PKM2 possesses
multiple non-metabolic functions during carcinogenesis
and chemoresistance [13]. For glutamine metabolism, a
growing number of studies have underscored the close
relationship between kidney-type glutaminase (GLS1)
expression and human cancer [14–16]. Moreover, GLS1
was also found to be highly associated with drugresistance. Fu et al. found that downregulating GLS1
could re-sensitize the Taxol-resistant breast cancer
cells to Taxol [17]. Moreover, Guo et al. observed that
inhibiting GLS1 could dramatically sensitize the PP242induced cell death in ovarian cancer, and substantially
reduce the phosphorylated STAT3 expression [18].
To explore the possible association of oxaliplatinresistance with aerobic glycolysis and glutamine
metabolism, we sought to employ small interfering
RNA (siRNA) to knockdown the expression of PKM
and GLS1. Then, malignant behaviors, 50% inhibiting
concentration (IC50), permeability glycoprotein (Pgp)
expression, and cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo were
observed and tested, striving to elucidate the potential
molecular mechanisms of oxaliplatin-resistance in CRC
cells.

Differentiated PKM2/GLS1 expression in CRC
cell lines
As indicated by qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse
transcription - polymerase chain reaction) technique,
PKM2 mRNA expression was 3.7 ± 0.53 (mean ±
standard deviation, similarly hereinafter) and 2.56 ±
0.11 in CRC cell line (THC8307) and in oxaliplatinresistant CRC cell line (THC8307/Oxa), respectively,
as compared with that in the HCMEC cell line. PKM2
expression was significantly higher in the THC8307 cell
line than in the THC8307/Oxa cell line, and it was also
significantly higher in the THC8307/Oxa cell line than in
the HCMEC cell line (both p < 0.05). Similarly, GLS1
mRNA expression was 3.34 ± 0.38 and 9.69 ± 0.17 in
the THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa cell lines respectively,
as compared with that in the HCMEC cell line, the
differences being statistically significant (both p < 0.05)
(Figure 1A). Subsequently, protein expression quantified
by Western blot (WB) technique further confirmed the
differentiated expression of GLS1 and PKM2 in CRC cell
lines (Figure 1B).

Knockdown of PKM2/GLS1 expression
After siRNA transfection, PKM2/GLS1 expression
was further confirmed in the THC8307 and THC8307/
Oxa cell lines. As shown in Figure 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D,
PKM2/GLS1 expression was successfully inhibited
in the THC8307 cell line, as shown by WB technique.

Figure 1: (A) The qRT-PCR technique showed differentiated expression of PKM2 and GLS1 in CRC cell lines. PKM2 mRNA expression

in the THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa cell lines were 3.7 ± 0.53 (mean ± standard deviation) and 2.56 ± 0.11 folded higher than that in the
HCMEC cell line (*p < 0.05). PKM2 mRNA expression in the THC8307 cell line was also higher than that in the THC8307/Oxa cell line
(*p < 0.05). GLS1 mRNA expression in the THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa cell lines were 3.34 ± 0.38 and 9.69 ± 0.17 folded higher than
that in the HCMEC cell line (**p < 0.01). By contrary with PKM2, GLS1 mRNA expression in the THC8307 cell line was lower than that
in the THC8307/Oxa cell (**p < 0.01). (B) Compared with the HCMEC, PKM2 and GLS1 expression was elevated in two CRC cell lines THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa). PKM2 expression was higher in the THC8307 cell line than that in the THC8307/Oxa cell line, while GLS1
expression was higher in the THC8307/Oxa cell line than that in the THC8307 cell line.

that PKM2 expression was significantly inhibited after PKM2-siRNA (siPKM2) in the THC8307 cell line. (C-D) WB technique showed that
GLS1 expression was significantly inhibited after GLS1-siRNA (siGLS1) in the THC8307 cell line. The expression of PKM2/GLS1 was
remarkably decreased in the siRNA group, compared with that in the NCsiRNA group (**p < 0.01). (E-F) qRT-PCR technique confirmed
PKM2/GLS1 mRNA expression was significantly inhibited after PKM2-siRNA (siPKM2)/GLS1-siRNA (siGLS1) in the THC8307/Oxa
cell line, which did not affect GLS1/PKM2 mRNA expression (**p < 0.01). The combination of PKM2-siRNA with GLS1-siRNA achieved
the optimal siRNA efficiency in the downregulation of PKM2/GLS1 (**p < 0.01). (G) WB technique confirmed the siRNA efficiency in
PKM2/GLS1 downregulation in the THC8307/Oxa cell line.

Simultaneously, in the THC8307/Oxa cell line, PKM2/
GLS1 expression was decreased based on qRT-PCR
and WB techniques, especially in the siPKM2+siGLS1
group. Moreover, no interference phenomena appeared in
two siRNAs, and the THC8307/Oxa cells were qualified
to carry out subsequent investigations after knockingdown PKM2/GLS1 expression (Figure 2E, 2F and 2G).

cell migration ability (Figure 3E, 3F) and cell invasion
ability (Figure 3G, 3H), as compared with the THC8307
and HCMEC cell lines (p < 0.05). Drug resistance examined
by MTS showed that with the increase of oxaliplatin
concentration, cell survival rate in the THC8307 cell line
was critically inhibited. In contrast, the THC8307/Oxa cell
line had a higher survival rate than the THC8307 cell line
(Figure 3I). The following results on IC50 illustrated that the
THC8307/Oxa cell line had significant higher IC50 than the
THC8307 cell line, as presented in Table 1.

Malignant behaviors of CRC cell lines
Colony formation, wound healing, Transwell test,
MTS test and IC50 calculation were performed in both
THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa cell lines. Before knockingdown PKM2/GLS1 expression, the THC8307/Oxa cell
line exhibited the most significant cell formation ability

Figure 3: (A-B) Cell formation values in the HCMEC, THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa cells were 0.66 ± 0.07, 0.94 ± 0.09 and 2.28 ± 0.21,

with the increase in oxaliplatin concentration. In comparison, the THC8307/Oxa cell line displayed a higher survival rate than that in the

ability (Figure 4C, 4D, 5C and 5D), cell migration ability
(Figure 4E and 5E) and cell invasion ability (Figure 4F
and 5F) were identified in the siPKM2+siGLS1 group,
as compared with the other treatment groups. Similarly,
MTS test demonstrated that cell survival rate in the

siPKM2+siGLS1 group was dramatically inhibited in
the THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa cell lines (Figure 4G
and 5G). Correspondingly, the siPKM2+siGLS1 group
in the THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa cell lines exhibited
the lowest IC50 (Table 2 and Table 3).

grew in a similar tendency, while tumor growth was
retarded significantly in group IV at the 17th day (Figure
8A). Consistently, at the 28th day, the mean volume and
weight of tumors in group IV were intensely smaller
than that in the other three xenograft groups (Figure 8A,
8B and 8C).

Immunofluorescence assay confirmed that the
THC8307/Oxa cell line exhibited more Pgp expression
(Figure 6A, 6B). After knocking-down PKM2/GLS1
expression in the THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa cell
lines, Pgp expression was significantly decreased in the
siPKM2+siGLS1 group (Figure 6C, 6D, 6E and 6F).

Detection of PKM2, GLS1 and Pgp in xenograft
by IHC analyses

Annexin V/PI assay
Annexin V/PI assay revealed that the THC8307/
Oxa cell line (apoptosis rate: 1.98 ± 0.28) had a more
anti-apoptosis ability, as compared with the THC8307
cell line (apoptosis rate: 3.75 ± 0.12). After knockingdown PKM2/GLS1 expression in the THC8307 and
THC8307/Oxa cell lines, apoptosis rate was significantly
boosted in the esiPKM2+siGLS1 group (Figure 7A1,
A2, B1 and B2).

IHC analyses were used to quantify the expression
of PKM2, GLS1 and Pgp in xenograft. As shown in Figure
9A and 9B, PKM2 and GLS1 expression in xenograft was
significantly reduced in group IV, which further reinforced
the efficiency of knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression.
Simultaneously, Pgp expression was also decreased in
xenograft.

Knockdown of PKM2/GLS1 expression inhibits

Apoptosis rate in xenograft by Tunel assay
Tunel assay was employed to detect apoptosis rate
in xenograft. As shown in Figure 9C and 9D, apoptosis
rate in xenograft was 4.0 ± 0.5, 9.0 ± 1.0, 29.0 ± 1.2, and
50.0 ± 1.5 in group I, II, III and IV, respectively. Apoptosis
rate in group IV was significantly augmented, as compared
with that in the other three xenograft groups.

Four different groups of CRC xenograft were
successfully established using the THC8307/Oxa
cells, that is, THC8307/Oxa negative control (group
I); NcsiRNA (100 μg/0.02 mL) plus oxaliplatin (5 mg/

DISCUSSION

sought to investigate the possible contributory role of
PKM2 and GLS1 expression in oxaliplatin-resistance
CRC.
Our initial findings identified significantly
elevated expression of PKM2 in the THC8307 cell line
relative to the HCMEC cell line, at both mRNA and
protein levels, which supported the notion that PKM2
might participate in the development of CRC. Further,
we found that PKM2 expression was significantly higher
in the THC8307 cell line than in the THC8307/Oxa cell
line, the finding in agreement with that in the study by
Martinez et al., who reported that PKM2 downregulation
was involved in oxaliplatin-resistance in CRC [28, 29].
In the case of GLS1, it is believed to act as an oncogene
and promote tumor growth [30, 31]. In the present study,
GLS1 expression was significantly high in the THC8307
cell line compared with the HCMEC cell line, implying
a contributory role of GLS1 in colorectal carcinogenesis.
However, GLS1 expression was observed to be
increased in the THC8307/Oxa cell line relative to the
THC8307 cell line, antilogous for PKM2. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first report that has explored
the association of GLS1 expression with oxaliplatinresistance in CRC.

Cancer is increasingly recognized as a metabolic
disease featured by energy imbalance [19]. At the initial
stage of tumor development, it is widely believed that
mitochondria dysfunction occurs and ATP synthesis
disrupts. As a consequence, tumor cells instead resort
to aerobic glycolysis and glutamine metabolism as
alternative ATP sources [20]. Aerobic glycolysis and
glutaminolysis may contribute to the oxaliplatinresistance of cancer cells through several manners,
such as the increase of lactate production and export,
the restriction on DNA oxidant drug efficiency, the
inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation rate, and so on
[21, 22]. Some investigators have proposed a workable
strategy by focusing on restoring energy balance in
order to delay tumor growth and reverse drug resistance
[23, 24]. It is hence vital to detect and characterize
some key modulators in aerobic glycolysis and
glutaminolysis to elucidate the possible relationship
between metabolic profiles and oxaliplatin-resistance
in CRC [25]. Since PKM2 and GLS1 separately are two
important rate-limiting enzymes in aerobic glycolysis
and glutaminolysis [26, 27], we in the present study

possessed more anti-apoptosis ability, as compared with that in the THC8307 cell line (apoptosis rate: 3.75 ± 0.12). (A2) The apoptosis
rate in the THC8307, NCsiRNA, siPKM2, siGLS1 and siPKM2 plus siGLS1 were 2.85 ± 0.12, 2.98 ± 0.15, 10.08 ± 0.4, 13.11 ± 0.25 and

Considering the important role of PKM2 and
GLS1 in CRC growth based on above evidence, we were
inspired to investigate the influence of knocking-down
PKM2/GLS1 expression in CRC cells. To fully address
this issue, we have successfully constructed two siRNAs
that were specifically targeted on PKM2 and GLS1,
and found that both siRNAs could normally take effect
without interference. After knocking-down PKM2/GLS1
expression, reduced IC50 was observed in both THC8307
and THC8307/Oxa cell lines, suggesting that PKM2/
GLS1 downregulation could enhance the sensitivity for
oxaliplatin and/or reverse drug-resistance in CRC cell
lines. These observations agreed with the findings of
previous studies that reported similar consequences of
siPKM2 and siGLS1 in lung cancer and breast cancer
cells [32, 33]. Then, a serial of malignant behaviors in

CRC cells were inspected in the present study. After
knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression, both THC8307
and THC8307/Oxa cell lines exhibited huge inhibitory
efficiencies on cell formation ability, kinetic ability,
migration ability, invasion ability and survival ability.
These phenomena appear to be a clear explanation as to
the anomaly of aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis,
insufficiency of ATP synthesis, inequality of energy
supply and generation in tumor cells [34].
As an energy-dependent transport protein, Pgp
is involved in multi-drug resistance in cancer, and it
further results in chemotherapy failure [35]. In the
present study, immunofluorescence assay revealed
that Pgp expression was significantly increased in the
THC8307/Oxa cell line, but significantly decreased
in both THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa cell lines after

PKM2/GLS1 downregulation was observed to inhibit
Pgp expression, strengthen drug sensitivity in the
THC8307 cell line and inverse oxaliplatin-resistance in
the THC8307/Oxa cell line. These observations were in
line with the findings of previous studies that reported
that PKM2 can enhance chemosensitivity to cisplatin
through interacting with the mTOR pathway in cervical
cancer, and GLS1 downregulation could re-sensitize the
Taxol-resistant breast cancer cells to Taxol [17, 26].
Anti-apoptosis represents another important
mechanism for oxaliplatin-resistance [36]. As revealed
by Annexin V/PI assay, apoptosis rate in the THC8307/
Oxa cell line was lower than that in the THC8307 cell
line, which can aid in explaining elevated oxaliplatinresistance in the THC8307/Oxa cell line. Then, after
knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression, apoptosis
rate was significantly augmented in both THC8307 and
THC8307/Oxa cell lines.
Finally, we examined the efficiency of knockingdown PKM2/GLS1 expression in vivo, and found that
their knockdown exerted a significant tumor-inhibitory
impact in xenograft. Correspondingly, Pgp expression

was suspended, and apoptosis rate was elevated. There
is strong agreement between in vivo and in vitro data,
indicating the robustness of our findings.
A major drawback of the present study is that only
one cell type (THC8307) was employed to investigate
the relationship between PKM2/GLS1 expression and
oxaliplatin-resistance in CRC. Bearing this drawback
in mind, we will design a protocol for following
investigations more elaborately and make results more
reliable.
In summary, the present findings enriched our
knowledge by demonstrating a significant association of
two key rate-limiting enzymes, PKM2 and GLS1, with
oxaliplatin-resistance in CRC. Moreover, differentiated
expression of PKM2 and GLS1 in CRC cell lines can
increase oxaliplatin-resistance by raising Pgp expression
and inhibiting cell apoptosis, whereas in drugresistance CRC cell lines, the knockdown of PKM2/
GLS1 expression can restore oxaliplatin-sensitivity by
degrading Pgp expression and inducing cell apoptosis.
This present study deepens our understanding of
molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy
resistance of oxaliplatin in CRC cells by proposing that

for CRC in clinical practice.

the methods described previously [39–41]. The HCMEC
cell line was used as the negative control.

Detection of Pgp expression

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Pgp expression was detected by immunofluorescence
assay before knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression.
Both THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa cell lines were
cultured in 6-well plates. After incubating and washing,
the plate was blocked with 1% non-fat milk for 30
min, followed by administration of anti-Pgp antibody
(1:50, abcam, ab10333). Then, a horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) antibody was added (1:2000, Thermo Scientific,
A16072). After knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression
in the THC8307 cell line, Pgp expression was re-tested by
immunofluorescence assay. The protocols were performed
according to the methods described previously [42]. The
HCMEC cell line was used as the negative control.

Cell lines and reagents
Highly differentiated CRC cell line (THC8307)
and oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cell line (THC8307/Oxa)
were purchased from the Saierbio Co., Ltd. (Saierbio,
Tianjin, China). Normal human colon mucosa epithelial
cell line (HCMEC) was kindly provided by Sun Yat-sen
University Cancer Center. Oxaliplatin was purchased
from the Sanofi-Avenitis (Sanofi-aventis US LLC,
Bridgewater, NJ, USA). Anti-PKM2 was purchased from
the Santa Cruz Co., Ltd. (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA,
USA). The other antibodies were purchased from the
Abcam (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). All study protocols
followed standard guidelines, and were approved by
the Human Research Ethics Committees of Sun Yat-sen
University.

Detection of apoptosis rate
Apoptosis rate of two CRC cell lines (THC8307
and THC8307/Oxa) was investigated by Annexin V/PI
assay before knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression, as
previously described [43]. After knocking-down PKM2/
GLS1 expression in the THC8307 cell line, apoptosis
assay was re-examined by Annexin V/PI assay. The
HCMEC cell line was used as the negative control.

Detection of PKM2/GLS1 expression
Both qRT-PCR and WB techniques in two CRC
cell lines, THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa, were performed
to quantify the PKM2/GLS1 expression, as previously
described [37, 38]. The HCMEC cell line was used as the
negative control.

CRC xenografts
Sixteen 4-week-old SCID mice with body weight
of approximately 20 g were purchased from the Animal
Center of Sun Yat-sen University, and they were raised
under specific pathogen-free conditions. For tumor
establishment, 2 × 107 THC8307/Oxa cells per mL were
washed twice with PBS, and were injected subcutaneously
in a volume of 0.1 mL into the flank of mice. After
inoculation, tumor-bearing mice were divided randomly
into 4 treatment groups: THC8307/Oxa negative control
(group I); NcsiRNA (100 μg/0.02 mL) plus oxaliplatin (5
mg/kg) (group II); siPKM2 (100 μg/0.02 mL) plus siGLS1
(100 μg/0.02 mL) (group III); siPKM2 (100 μg/0.02 mL)
plus siGLS1 (100 μg/0.02 mL) plus oxaliplatin (5 mg/
kg) (group IV). Animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with the public health service policy, and they
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees
of Sun Yat-sen University. Mice bearing tumors were
observed, and tumor size was measured once every 3 days
using vernier caliper. At the end of the experiments (at
the 28th day), all animals were killed, and the tumors from
each animal were removed and prepared [44].

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection of
PKM2/GLS1
The GLS1/PKM2-siRNAs were chemically
synthesized by the Sigma Chemical Co.,Ltd. (St. Louis,
MO, USA). The sequences of siRNAs were as follows:
for GLS1-siRNA1: 5′- GUU GAA AGA GUG UAU
GGA UdT dT -3′ (forward) and 5′- AUC CAU ACA
CUC UUU CAA CdT dT -3′ (reverse); for PKM2siRNA2: 5′ ‑GAA UGA AUG UGG CUC GUC UdT dT
-3′ (forward) and 5′- AGA CGA GCC ACA UUC AUU
CdT dT -3′ (reverse). Then, the efficiency of siRNA
transfection of PKM2/GLS1 in the THC8307 cell line
was examined by WB technique. The NcsiRNA was
used as the negative control.

Detection of malignant behaviors in CRC cells
Colony formation, cell scratch, Transwell test, MTS
test and IC50 calculation were performed in two CRC cell
lines - THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa, before knockingdown PKM2/GLS1 expression. After its knockdown in
the THC8307 cell line, all phenotype experiments were
re-performed. All protocols were performed according to
