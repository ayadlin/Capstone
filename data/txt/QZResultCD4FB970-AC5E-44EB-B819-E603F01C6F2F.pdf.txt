BACKGROUND. Observational data are used increasingly to assess the effectiveness
of therapies. However, selection biases are likely to have an impact on results
and threaten the validity of these studies.

METHODS. The primary objective of the current study was to explore the effect of
selection biases in observational studies of treatment effectiveness in cancer care.
Patients were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End ResultsMedicare linked database. The following groups of patients were included: 5245

cancer, 43,847 men with active treatment versus observation for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, and 4860 patients with lymph node-positive colon
were compared by therapy for the outcomes of cancer-specific mortality, othercause mortality, and overall mortality.

RESULTS. In all comparisons, the observational data produced improbable
results. For example, when evaluating outcomes of men who were treated with
and without androgen deprivation for locally advanced prostate cancer, men who
underwent androgen deprivation had higher prostate cancer mortality (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.92) despite clinical trial evidence that
this treatment improves cancer mortality. Controlling for comorbidity, extent of

here has been a growing interest in using observational data to
study cancer outcomes. This interest is driven in part by the
availability of population-based data—in particular, data from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Tumor Registry
that have been merged with Medicare charge data.1 These databases
have the advantages of excellent external validity, and they allow for
the study of populations that often are not included in clinical trials,
such as the elderly, minorities, and patients with higher burdens of
comorbidities. In addition, large administrative databases can provide information on patterns of care and treatment compliance2–4;
can detect rare toxicities and assess treatment toxicities in representative, population-based cohorts5–9; and can permit the comparison
of toxicities across different patient populations.5,8–10 However, more
recently, administrative datasets are being used to compare the

effects of different treatments on overall survival.
This approach has been used across many tumor
types, including breast, lung, colon, rectal, prostate,
and ovarian cancers.11–19
Selection biases, particularly confounding by indication, are the primary threat to the validity of
using observational data to estimate benefits of
therapies.20,21 These biases can operate in several
ways. For example, in a comparison between therapies where 1 therapy is considered potentially more
efficacious (eg, adjuvant chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy), a bias may be expected whereby patients
with poorer prognosis cancers would be more likely
to receive that therapy. Alternatively, in a comparison
involving potentially more toxic treatments versus
less toxic treatments (eg, invasive surgery vs radiation treatment or chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy), a selection bias may be expected whereby
patients with better underlying health—those considered more likely to tolerate the treatment—would be
more likely to receive the more toxic therapy. Investigators clearly are aware of these potential biases and
use statistical techniques to address them. Multivariate analyses, stratification, matching, restricting, and
propensity analyses often are used adjusting for information available in the datasets, such as age; ethnicity; neighborhood socioeconomic level; and prior
diagnoses, procedures, and hospitalizations.11–13,22,23
Nevertheless, unmeasured confounders are likely to
persist.
In this article, we explore the strong effects of
selection biases in observational studies. We hypothesized that we would obtain results from observational analyses that were implausible when
considered in the light of published data from clinical trials. We also hypothesized that the usual means
of dealing with selection biases, such as controlling
for patient and tumor characteristics using multivariate and propensity analyses, would not eliminate the
improbable results. We present several examples,
including reanalyses of previously published data, to
illustrate the effects of common selection biases. For
the first example, we selected a situation in which
we believed that selection biases might produce implausible results compared with results from a randomized controlled trial. For the second and third
examples, we reanalyzed previously published data.
In all cases, we examined cancer mortality, noncancer mortality, and overall mortality. We reasoned that
any real benefit of cancer therapy could be manifested only through differences in cancer-specific
mortality but that selection biases might result in differences in noncancer mortality that would be as
great or greater than the differences in cancer mor-

tality, calling into question the reliability of using
mortality endpoints to assess treatment efficacy in
nonrandomized data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
Our approach was similar in all cases and was analogous to approaches that have been used by previous
investigators,11–17,24–27 in that we compared the effectiveness of different cancer therapies on outcomes.
We used the merged SEER-Medicare database as our
data source, which also has been used in prior outcome studies.11–17,24–27 The SEER Program is a
national population-based tumor registry run by the
National Cancer Institute that collects information
on incident cancer cases. Patients in the SEER database who are eligible for Medicare have been linked
to their Medicare records.1
Example 1: Androgen-deprivation therapy versus none
after primary radiation therapy for locally advanced
prostate cancer
This analysis included 5245 men with locally
advanced prostate cancer (either tumor [T] classified
as T2/T3 with a Gleason score of 8–10 or tumor classified as T4) in the SEER-Medicare database who
were recipients of primary radiation therapy, aged
66 years, and diagnosed between 1992 and 1999.
Patients were excluded if they had primary surgical
therapy, if they had health maintenance organization
(HMO) coverage, or if they were not enrolled in
Medicare Parts A and B for the 12 months before to
the 6 months after their cancer diagnosis. Prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and androgen deprivation
were defined as described previously.10 Briefly, radical prostatectomy was defined from SEER coding on
site-specific surgery or any of the following codes
from Medicare claims: Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 55,810, 55,812, 55,815, 55,801,
55,821, 55,831, 55,842, 55,845; or International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-09) procedure code 60.5. Radiation therapy was identified
from SEER coding on site-specific surgery or any of
the following codes from Medicare claims: CPT
codes 77,401 through 77,499 and codes 77,750
through 77,799; and ICD-09 codes 92.21 through
92.29, V58.0, V66.1, and V67.1. Androgen deprivation
was defined as either orchiectomy or at least 1 claim
for a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH) agonist within 6 months of diagnosis. GNRH codes are
any of the following Healthcare Common Procedure
Coding System (HCPCS) codes: J9202, J1950, J9217,
J9218, and J9219. Comorbidity scores were calcu-

lated by using Klabunde’s adaptation of the Charlson
comorbidity index.28,29
A series of Cox proportional-hazards models
were developed that incorporated increasing numbers of covariates. Men who underwent androgen deprivation were compared with men who did not
receive androgen deprivation for the outcomes of
mortality from prostate cancer, other-cause mortality,
and all cause mortality. We adjusted for the following
variables: T classification, histologic grade (low, moderate, poorly differentiated; unknown), year of diagnosis, age (continuous), comorbidity (0, 1–2, 3),
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic, other), SEER region, census tract education
(percent of individuals living in a given census tract
with <12 years of education, divided into quartiles),
census tract poverty (percent of individuals living in
a given census tract living below the poverty level,
divided into quartiles), number of claims for prostate-specific antigen measurements in the 12 months
before diagnosis (continuous), and number of provider visits in the 12 months before diagnosis (continuous). Missing values were coded as unknown and
were included in the analyses. Follow-up was
through December 31, 2000.
The propensity that a patient would receive adjuvant androgen deprivation was generated from the
logistic regression model that incorporated the
potential confounding factors listed in Table 1.13,30–32
Then, we grouped the patients into 5 strata representing quintiles of the propensity score. The Cochran Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test was used to
determine whether the covariates were balanced after adjusting for propensity quintiles. The covariates
that retained a significant difference between the
treated and untreated groups were adjusted together
with propensity scores in the Cox proportionalhazards model. We also noted the association
between treatment and mortality within each stratum of propensity quintiles.

Example 2: Active treatment versus observation for men
with localized prostate cancer
For this example, we reanalyzed previously published
data.19 The original study compared survival between
men who were treated actively for prostate cancer
(surgery or radiation) with men who were observed.
We replicated the methods in that study as described
below. In brief, the study population included men
between ages 65 years and 80 years with an incident
prostate cancer diagnosed between 1991 and 1999 in
the SEER-Medicare database. Men who had moderately to well differentiated, nonmetastatic T1 or T2
tumors were included. Men were excluded if they

were diagnosed at autopsy or death, if they had Medicare entitlement based on endstage renal disease, or
if they died within 1 year of diagnosis. Patients were
excluded if they had HMO coverage or if they were
not enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B from the 3
months before to the 6 months after their cancer diagnosis. Patients were considered to have received
active treatment if they received external-beam
radiation therapy, had radiation implants, or underwent radical prostatectomy. Cox models were developed to compare outcomes of men with active
treatment versus observation. The final models
adjusted for year of diagnosis, age, race, urban residence, marital status, income, education, SEER
region, tumor size, tumor grade, and patient comorbidity, as described in detail in the original study.
We replicated the previously published analyses
and added the following additional analyses: In addition to the endpoint of overall survival, we developed
Cox models for the endpoints of prostate cancer survival and other-cause mortality. We plotted survival
curves from stratified Cox proportional-hazards models, adjusting for age, comorbidity, SEER region, and
year of diagnosis. These survival curves are presented
for type of therapy (radical prostatectomy, radiation,
or observation) and for a noncancer control population. The noncancer control population was selected
as follows: From the 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries who did not have any cancer in the SEER-Medicare data, we selected men ages 65 years to 80 years
who were resident in a SEER area from 1991 through
1999. Noncancer controls were assigned randomly to
match the distribution of year of diagnosis for the
cancer cohort. If men were not enrolled in Medicare
Parts A and B, if they were enrolled in an HMO from
3 months before study entry to 6 months after study
entry, or if the died within 1 year of study entry, then
they were excluded. From these noncancer controls,
a cohort of 43,847 men was built to match the age
distribution of the patients with prostate cancer.
Among these, 12,234 men died during follow-up. We
also developed Cox models with the endpoints of
mortality from heart disease, other cancers, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, pneumonia, diabetes, accident, other infections, and dementia to illustrate the effects of confounding.

Example 3
In our third example, we also reanalyzed previously
published data.13 The original study evaluated survival associated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy among elderly patients with
lymph node-positive colon cancer. We replicated the

methods as described in the original report.13
Patients were included who met the following criteria: first diagnosis of primary colon cancer between
1992 and 1996, aged 65 years, and stage III disease.
Men were excluded if they were enrolled in an HMO
or if they were not covered by Medicare Parts A and
B from 12 months before diagnosis until 16 months
after diagnosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU
was identified by claims with an HCPCS J-code of
J9190 within 120 days of diagnosis. We constructed
Cox models to estimate both overall survival, as
reported previously, and other-cause and colon cancer-specific survival for patients who did and did not
receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Cox models were
adjusted for year of diagnosis, age, sex, urban residence, SEER region, lymph nodes, tumor grade,
extent of disease, comorbidity, and propensity score.

RESULTS
Androgen Deprivation for Prostate Cancer
In our first analysis, we evaluated the outcomes of
men who did or did not receive androgen deprivation
after primary radiation therapy for locally advanced
(stage III) prostate cancer. Randomized clinical trial
data have demonstrated a survival benefit for androgen deprivation in this population.33–35 Patients who
underwent androgen deprivation had higher grade
tumors, were more educated, had more frequent phy-

sician visits, and were diagnosed more recently than
patients who did not receive androgen deprivation
(P < .0001 for each) (Table 1). After adjusting for propensity score, imbalances remained in the year of diagnosis and in the number of provider visits before
diagnosis. Then, we performed a series of Cox models
that incorporated increasing numbers of covariates.
The results of those survival analyses are shown in
Table 2. In the unadjusted analysis, men who underwent androgen deprivation had a higher risk of death
from prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35; 95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 1.11–1.64). After adjusting for all measurable confounders, a persistent effect
of higher prostate cancer mortality was observed
among men who underwent androgen deprivation
(HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.32–2.01). There was no significant
difference observed in other-cause mortality between
men who did and men who did not undergo androgen
deprivation.
Next, we conducted a propensity analysis to
adjust for unmeasured confounders.30–32 Propensity
scores are an individual patient’s likelihood of receiving a treatment calculated from a logistic regression
model that is based on their covariate information.
We show the results first with the propensity score as
a covariate in our model and then with the results
stratified into quintiles based on propensity score. In
each analysis, prostate cancer mortality consistently
was higher among men underwent androgen depri-

score along with the imbalanced covariates, the HR
for prostate cancer mortality was 1.65 (95% CI, 1.33–
2.03).

Active Therapy Versus Observation for
Localized Prostate Cancer
In the second example, we compared the outcomes
of men who received active therapy versus men who
were observed for localized prostate cancer. We repli-

cated the methods in the original study and were
able to reproduce the cohort of patients and point
estimates of survival.19 Then, we expanded on the
previously published results by performing Cox analyses that demonstrated mortality from prostate cancer and mortality from other causes in addition to
all-cause mortality. Table 3 presents the results of the
survival analyses. In the unadjusted and adjusted
analyses, patients who received active therapy had
significantly lower all-cause mortality (adjusted HR,

0.68; 95% CI, 0.65–0.70) compared with patients on
observation from prostate cancer, as reported in the
original study. However, patients who received active
therapy had had lower mortality from all other
causes (unadjusted HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.50–0.54;
adjusted HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.65–0.71). The confounding between overall health status and active therapy
for prostate cancer also is demonstrated in Figure 1,
which shows that patients who underwent radical
prostatectomy for prostate cancer actually had better
survival than a control population without cancer. To
explore the association further between active therapy and cause of death, we performed Cox models
for other individual causes of death. The HRs with
95% CIs are plotted in Figure 2. For each individual
cause of death, such as diabetes or pneumonia,
active treatment for prostate cancer was associated
with a significant mortality benefit, similar to the
benefit observed for overall mortality or mortality
from prostate cancer.

Chemotherapy for Lymph Node-positive Colon Cancer
In our last example, we also reanalyzed data that
were published previously in an analysis of outcomes
for patients with lymph node-positive colon cancer.13
The original study reported that patients who
received fluorouracil-based chemotherapy had a significantly lower hazard of death (HR, 0.66; 95% CI,
0.60–0.73) than patients who did not receive chemotherapy. We extended on the previous work and performed Cox regression models to estimate colon
cancer-specific mortality and other-cause mortality
in addition to the previously published overall mortality. We reasoned that, if the lower hazard of death

was because of treatment alone, then deaths from
other causes would not be related to chemotherapy
use. The results are shown in Table 4. We observed a
strong association between fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and other-cause mortality (HR, 0.48; 95%
CI, 0.41–0.56). For colon cancer mortality, fluorouracil chemotherapy also was associated with a survival
benefit (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72–0.89), although the
effect was not as strong as that for overall survival.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we selected several examples in
which we had a priori reasons to suspect that selection biases would influence outcomes. We believed
that there may have been strong selection biases
both on extent and aggressiveness of the tumor and
on the underlying health of the patient. We reasoned
that the bias for patients with more aggressive cancer
to receive more therapy would result in an implausibly worse survival among more extensively treated
patients. The selection bias favoring the treatment of
healthier patients would result in improved survival
among treated patients. These biases could work in
isolation or could be present simultaneously. Because
these biases could have opposite effects on survival
and, thus, tend to cancel each other out, we segregated survival by measuring 3 types of mortality: allcause mortality, mortality from cancer, and mortality
from all causes other than the cancer. This allowed
us to estimate the impact of the 2 proposed selection
biases. Selection biases for poorer prognosis tumors
would be reflected best in cancer-specific mortality,
whereas biases involving the selection of healthier
patients would be reflected in mortality from all
other causes.

* Overall, 2464 men received chemotherapy, and 2396 did not. The total number of deaths from all causes was 1103 with chemotherapy and 1539 without; the number of colon cancer deaths was 805 with
chemotherapy and 876 without; and the number of deaths from other causes was 298 with chemotherapy and 663 without.

Adjusted for year of diagnosis; age; sex; urban residence; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results region; no. of lymph nodes; tumor grade; extent of disease; and comorbidity score.

In the comparison of men with prostate cancer
who received either active therapy or observation, we
hypothesized that healthier men who were diagnosed
with prostate cancer would be more likely to receive
active treatment, which would result in improvements in both all-cause survival and in deaths from
causes other than prostate cancer. We did demonstrate a large effect of active therapy on deaths from
all causes. In fact, active therapy for prostate cancer
had at least as much effect on deaths from diseases
like pneumonia and cardiovascular disease as it did
on deaths from prostate cancer. It is important to
consider how odd these results actually are. It is not
plausible that prostate cancer therapy improves survival from causes other than prostate cancer. The
most likely explanation is that selection biases are responsible for the effects observed. More noteworthy,
these biases persist after statistical adjustment for all
measured confounders. It is also possible that active
therapy is a marker for overall quality of care.
Two potential explanations for why controlling
for reported comorbidity does not adequately control
for selection biases are the lack of information on
functional status and the lack of information on selfreported health. Measures of functional status, such
as the Activities of Daily Living score, the Karnofsky
performance status scale, or the Barthel index, independently can predict future physical function, morbidity, and mortality.36–38 Self-rated health, which
typically is assessed by using a 4- or 5-point scale
from excellent to poor, also has been demonstrated
as a strong predictor of survival in several observational studies.39–42 Most relevant to our current stu-

dies, self-rated health remains a strong predictor of
survival even after controlling for comorbidity and all
other measurable factors that may affect survival.
The best example is the Cardiovascular Health Study,
which included a rich variety of clinical information
from physical examination, laboratory assessments,
and noninvasive testing, such as cardiac ejection
fraction.43 Self-rated health still was a strong, independent predictor of survival. This means that there
is information available to individual patients about
their health that is not captured even with extensive
medical assessment and yet is reflected in a simple,
subjective health assessment. The information reflected by patients’ self-rated health also presumably
is accessible to the clinicians advising them if the
physicians inquire. That information could guide
treatment decisions, and patients who have more robust underlying health may be more likely to choose
more invasive and more extensive treatments. Given
the effect of competing risks on outcomes of treatment, such decision making may be entirely appropriate.44
A similar line of reasoning can be used to explain
the inability to completely control for the selection
biases whereby those with more aggressive tumors
tend to receive more extensive treatments (ie, confounding by indication). The information reported in
SEER on tumor characteristics is extensive and
includes tumor stage, size, histologic type, histologic
grade, and the number of positive lymph nodes.
However, it would be naive to assume that experienced clinicians would not make more subtle distinctions in tumor prognosis than could be made

based only on the information found in SEER. The
example of androgen deprivation for the treatment
of prostate cancer illustrates how difficult it can be
to control for tumor aggressiveness. We observed
that, whereas clinical trials have demonstrated a survival benefit of androgen deprivation, our observational data indicate that androgen deprivation is
associated with worse tumor-specific survival.17–19
Presumably, the finding that men with more aggressive tumors were more likely to receive androgen
deprivation could not be captured entirely by the
extent-of-disease characteristics available in the
SEER data.
Just as adjusting for comorbidity and tumor
characteristics did not completely remove selection
biases, statistical adjustment using propensity scores
did not substantially alter the findings. Some reports
have suggested that propensity scores can eliminate
up to 90% of the bias resulting from confounding
covariates.45–48 In our examples, adjustment for propensity score had little effect on the HRs. A recent
study evaluated the effects of variable choice in propensity analyses.49 The authors suggested that variables unrelated to the exposure but related to the
outcome always should be included in propensity
score analyses, because they will decrease the variance without increasing bias. It is not clear that the
datasets currently used for observational studies of
cancer treatment, such as the SEER-Medicare linked
data, can furnish such a variable. None of the cancer
treatment outcome studies that we reviewed
included such a variable.11–19 Other techniques, like
instrumental variable analyses, take an analogous
approach to minimize bias in observational studies.
However, statistical techniques cannot eliminate all
bias and confounding.
Our final example of fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for colon cancer is a less extreme and perhaps
more representative situation. We note that our analyses lead to the same conclusion as the original study—
that chemotherapy for lymph node-positive colon cancer is associated with improved survival. These observational analyses in older patients are consistent with
data from randomized clinical trials in younger
patients, which have demonstrated conclusively that
5-FU chemotherapy for colon cancer is associated
with a 33% lower mortality rate.50 Other well designed
observational studies also have produced results that
closely approximate data from randomized clinical
trials.51,52 However, in the colon cancer example, the
strength of the association between chemotherapy
and survival is strongest for noncancer deaths, which
presumably are not being prevented with chemotherapy. Thus, our findings call into question the reliability

of using overall survival as the primary endpoint. Our
results with the other examples raise the possibility
that this finding may have resulted from a chance
alignment of confounders.
We have drawn several major conclusions. First,
the results of observational studies that compare outcomes of different therapies should be viewed with
some skepticism. Such publications may result from
an interaction of selection biases with publication
bias. Analyses that make sense are followed up and
ultimately published, whereas analyses that produce
implausible results, such as some of the examples
presented here, are more likely to be discarded or
rejected for publication if they are pursued.
Second, any analyses of observational data for
treatment outcome, at a minimum, should attempt
to segregate the outcome measurements into those
that possibly may be caused by the treatments versus
those that could not be caused by the treatments.
Most prior publications on cancer treatment outcomes only assessed all-cause mortality.11–17 Examination of treatment effects on mortality from cancer
versus other causes may produce clues for the presence of unmeasured selection biases. This would
hold not just for cancer therapies but also for observational studies of outcomes from therapies for any
condition. There are many clinical situations, particularly in the treatment of the elderly, in which data
from clinical trials are nonexistent, and observational
studies may be the only potential method to assess
benefits of treatment. We suggest that disease-specific survival, other-cause survival, and overall survival
all should be provided in any studies of treatment
outcomes. Finally, the strong yet implausible treatment effects observed in our analyses should reinforce the caution and modesty of all investigators
assessing outcomes from observational data.
