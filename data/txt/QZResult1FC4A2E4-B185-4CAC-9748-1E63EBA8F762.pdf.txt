Abstract
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation induces excitotoxicity,
contributing to post-stroke brain injury. Hitherto, NMDAR deactivation failed in
clinical trials due to insufficient pre-clinical study designs and drug toxicity. Flupirtine
is an indirect NMDAR antagonist being used as analgesic in patients. Taking into
account its tolerability profile, we evaluated effects of flupirtine on post-stroke
tissue survival, neurological recovery and brain remodeling. Mice were exposed to
stroke and intraperitoneally treated with saline (control) or flupirtine at various
doses (1-10 mg/kg) and time-points (0-12 hours). Tissue survival and cell signaling
were studied on day 2, whereas neurological recovery and tissue remodeling were
analyzed until day 84. Flupirtine induced sustained neuroprotection, when delivered
up to 9 hours. The latter yielded enhanced neurological recovery that persisted over
three months and which was accompanied by enhanced angioneurogenesis. On the
molecular level, inhibition of calpain activation was noted, which was associated with
increased signal-transducer-and-activator-of-transcription-6 (STAT6) abundance,
reduced N-terminal-Jun-kinase and NF-κB activation, as well as reduced proteasomal
activity. Consequently, blood-brain-barrier integrity was stabilized, oxidative stress
was reduced and brain leukocyte infiltration was diminished. In view of its excellent
tolerability, considering its sustained effects on neurological recovery, brain tissue
survival and remodeling, flupirtine is an attractive candidate for stroke therapy.

Introduction

preclinical safety evaluations.
The triaminopyridine derivative flupirtine is an
indirect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
antagonist that reduces glutamatergic neurotransmission
by activation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels
(Kir), thus stabilizing the resting membrane potential
and enhancing the Mg2+ block [3, 4]. Upon stimulation
of neuronal Kv7 potassium channels and subsequent
reduction of excessive neuronal action potential
generation, flupirtine induces pain relief and muscle
relaxation [5-7].
In view of its excellent tolerability, flupirtine has
been used for several decades in human patients. During

Following the great advancement of recanalizing
therapies in the recent past, which allow to obtain a
significant percentage of patients without major deficits
by combination of tissue-plasminogen activator-induced
thrombolysis and interventional clot removal [1, 2],
there remains a major need of establishing restorative
therapies for sustained neurological recovery in patients
with persistent neurological deficits. To that end, the
identification of candidate drugs that are already approved
by local authorities is highly attractive because clinical
studies may be implemented without time-consuming

this time, flupirtine gained interest not only as an analgetic
but also as a potential neuroprotective compound. Since
the 1990-ies, flupirtine has been demonstrated to protect
against slowly progressive neuronal degeneration [8-12]
and hypoxic-ischemic injury [13-18]. In vitro studies
suggested that the neuroprotective effects in hypoxiaischemia are due to prevention of intracellular calcium
overload and oxidative stress reduction [14-17].
As a matter of interest, only two studies analyzed
flupirtine-induced neuroprotection in vivo in models of
global or permanent focal cerebral ischemia [13, 16]. In
these studies, pre-treatment with flupirtine reduced both
neurological impairment and histological brain injury for
up to two weeks. In these models, reduction of brain injury
was not observed when flupirtine was given after stroke
induction. Thus, the therapeutic potential was considered
low. Taking into account the excellent tolerability
profile of flupirtine, considering the potential impact of
NMDAR antagonists in the post-acute ischemic phase,
we systematically reevaluated the therapeutic potential of
flupirtine after transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice,
followed by an analysis of mechanisms involved in both
acute neuroprotection and post-acute brain remodeling.

Flupirtine
enhances
neuroregeneration

Studying acute neuroprotection is not sufficient
in order to assess the therapeutic potential of a drug,
which is one reason for negative clinical trials despite
positive results in rodent stroke models. As such, brain
injury and post-ischemic angioneurogenesis was analyzed
three months after focal cerebral ischemia. Brain injury
as shown by neuronal density was significantly reduced
due to treatment with flupirtine, suggesting that flupirtine
when given no later than 9 h induces stable and sustained
neuroprotection in our model (Figure 3A). In this context,
analysis of post-ischemic angioneurogenesis revealed
significantly increased numbers of new-born CD31+ cells
(Figure 3B; endothelial cell marker), Dcx+ cells (Figure
3C; immature neuronal marker) and NeuN+ cells (Figure
3D; mature neuronal marker), albeit the latter was low
in number. Consequently, flupirtine treatment is not only
associated with neuroprotection but also with increased
post-ischemic angioneurogenesis, which might affect each
other mutually.

Results

Flupirtine induces stabilization of the bloodbrain-barrier and reduction of oxidative stress
and intracerebral inflammation

Flupirtine induces acute neuroprotection, reduces
motor coordination impairment and ameliorates
rt-PA-induced toxicity

Although flupirtine is known to act via indirect
antagonism of NMDAR, effects on blood-brain-barrier
(BBB) integrity and reduction of post-ischemic oxidative
stress as well as inflammation within the ischemic lesion
site have not been studied, yet. Consequently, we assessed
BBB integrity as well as oxidative and inflammatory
stress at 48 h after stroke induction in brain lysates. Acute
treatment with flupirtine 9 h post-stroke significantly
reduced extravasation of Evans blue when compared to
controls, suggesting that flupirtine enhances BBB integrity
(Figure 4A). Likewise, treatment with flupirtine reduced
oxidative stress within the ischemic lesion site (Figure
4B). Intracerebral inflammatory response as analyzed by
flow cytometry was significantly reduced after treatment
with flupirtine when compared to controls (Figure 4C),
suggesting that flupirtine reduces both post-ischemic
oxidative stress and inflammation.

Before assessing the therapeutic time window dose
response experiments were performed, for which flupirtine
was injected during reperfusion using a dose between
1-10 mg/kg BW following the protocol from Block et
al. who used 5 mg/kg BW [13]. Whereas a dose of both
5 and 10 mg/kg BW reduced infarct volumes on day 2
post-stroke, no effect was observed with 1 mg/kg BW
(Figure 1A). Since no signs of toxicity were obvious after
treatment with either of the aforementioned doses, future
experiments were done using 10 mg/kg BW. Application
of the latter proved to be neuroprotective when given
no later than 9 h post-stroke (Figure 1B-1C), as shown
by infarct volume analysis as well as by assessment of
TUNEL+ cells on day 2. Interestingly, the same treatment
paradigm proved to be successful to reduce rt-PA-mediated
acute brain toxicity (Figure 1D), again suggesting possible
clinical feasibility of flupirtine.
Reduction of infarct volumes does not necessarily
reflect reduction of motor coordination impairment.
Consequently, motor coordination was analyzed for as
long as twelve weeks after induction of stroke. Treatment
of mice with flupirtine at a dose of 10 mg/kg BW at 9
h post-stroke (which was the experimental paradigm
used for the remaining studies) resulted in better test

signaling pathways involving calpains as well as c-JunN-terminal kinases (JNK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
[19-21]. Cerebral ischemia has been shown to reduce
levels of the transcription factor signal-transducerand-activator-of-transcription-6 (STAT6) [22], which
is also degraded by calpain [23]. Recently, STAT6 has
been demonstrated to inhibit JNK and NF-κB signaling
pathways under inflammatory conditions outside the CNS
[24]. We therefore analyzed whether or not flupirtine
affects these cell signaling pathways after induction of
cerebral ischemia.
Analysis of calpain activity 48 h post-stroke
revealed significantly increased protease activity in control
animals, whereas treatment with flupirtine reduced calpain
activity (Figure 5A). In this context, induction of cerebral
ischemia resulted in activation of the JNK (expressed as
abundance of phosphorylated c-Jun) and NF-κB pathway,
which is controlled by its physiological inhibitor IκB-α
(Figure 5B-5C). Expression of the latter was reduced
in controls (Figure 5B-5C). Treatment with flupirtine,
however, reversed the aforementioned effects, i.e. both
JNK and NF-κB signaling pathways were inhibited by
flupirtine. Interestingly, stroke-induced reduction of
STAT6 was significantly reversed by flupirtine as well
(Figure 5B-5C). Since NF-κB signaling is associated with
activation of the proteasome, which is one key component
in developing ischemic brain injury [25], chymotrypsinlike activity was measured in brain lysates. Two days after
stroke, proteasome activity was significantly reduced when
compared to controls (Figure 5D). These data suggest that
flupirtine indirectly exerts post-ischemic neuroprotection
via reduction of calcium-induced activation of JNK
and NF-κB signaling pathways associated with reduced
proteasomal activity.

into account the overall low frequency of side effects with
no clinically relevant drug interactions [7] and both high
bioavailability after oral/rectal administration as well as
a high distribution volume into virtually all extravascular
and intravascular compartments [6]. Indeed, derivatives
of flupirtine such as retigabine have been approved for
treatment of CNS disorders such as epilepsy [28], again
underlying the therapeutic potential of flupirtine and
derivatives for treatment of ischemic stroke.
Stimulation or inhibition of NMDAR remains a
double-edged sword. As such, stimulation of NMDAR
can induce both cell survival or cell death depending on
NMDA concentrations. Previous in vitro data suggest that
modest stimulation or inhibition of NMDAR promote
neuronal survival, whereas high concentrations of NMDA
or appropriate inhibitors induce cell death [29, 30].
Likewise, complete inhibition or knockout of the NMDAR
induces cell death during ontogenesis of the brain [31,
32]. Hence, the hypothesis on extrasynaptic versus
synaptic stimulation of NMDAR has been suggested with
stimulation of synaptic NMDAR to induce pro-survival
cascades such as ERK and stimulation of extrasynaptic
receptors to induce death signal cascades [21, 26].
Neuroprotection due to flupirtine treatment might thus
indirectly inhibit extrasynaptic NMDAR, contributing to
neuronal survival. The latter in turn is a consequence of
decreased calcium concentrations [16].
Calcium is one key factor in excitotoxic ischemic
brain injury, among which the activation of calpains
is crucial. As such, an NMDA-induced increase in
intracellular calcium with subsequent activation of calpain
is the most important signaling pathway contributing to
post-ischemic proteolysis and ultimately cell death [33,
34]. Consequently, calpain activity is significantly induced
by treatment with flupirtine in our study. Among a great
deal of substrates to calpain degradation, STAT proteins
such as neuroprotective STAT6 are critically involved
[23]. STAT6 expression has recently been shown to be
reduced within the ischemic rodent brain after induction
of stroke [22], and treatment with flupirtine reverses
this effect. Moreover, STAT6 has been described to
inhibit JNK and NF-κB signaling pathways [24], which
are critically involved in progression of ischemic brain
injury [20, 35-37]. Treatment with flupirtine inhibits these
pathways and reduces proteasomal activity, which in
turn regulates NF-κB signaling via degradation of IκB-α
[38]. Reduced proteasomal activity after treatment with
flupirtine is thus one critical component contributing to
tissue injury during cerebral ischemia.
Although the aforementioned mechanisms
underlying flupirtine-induced neuroprotection are most
likely not exclusive by nature of indirect NMDAR
antagonism, they seem to significantly have an impact
on readout parameters of assessing post-ischemic brain
injury. In this context, subacute treatment with flupirtine
did not only reduce infarct volumes and stabilized BBB

Discussion
The present study analyzed the therapeutic potential
of flupirtine and its underlying mechanisms during
an observation period of three months after induction
of stroke. We show that flupirtine induces sustained
neuroprotection and neuroregeneration in a dosedependent manner when given no later than nine hours
post-stroke. In this context, flupirtine reduces calcium
dependent calpain activation followed by restoration of
STAT6 and subsequent inhibition of both JNK and NF-κB
pathways. Inhibition of the latter is associated with poststroke activation of the proteasome and thus helps reduce
post-ischemic brain injury.
Excitotoxicity after cerebral ischemia has long been
in focus of experimental stroke research. Yet, the majority
of neuroprotective trials have failed in clinical settings due
to narrow time window, side effects and low number of
patients as well as inappropriate quality standards [26].
Despite recent reports on liver toxicity of flupirtine [27],
the therapeutic potential of flupirtine is intriguing taken

integrity but also reduced the inflammatory response and
oxidative stress within the ischemic lesion site, most likely
due to reduced proteasome-NF-κB and JNK signaling. Of
note, the dosage used for the present study was of clinical
relevance where dosages of some hundred milligrams are
in order to achieve pain reduction [7], albeit the present
work did not study effects of retard pills of flupirtine.
More importantly, these acute and profound effects were
associated with sustained and stable neurological recovery
for at least three months involving enhanced post-ischemic
angioneurogenesis. The herein described and sustained
neuroprotection is, however, in contrast to previous reports
on flupirtine-induced neuroprotection after experimental
stroke [13, 16]. These studies demonstrated reduced postischemic brain injury for up to two weeks when flupirtine
was applied before induction of stroke, but failed to do
so when flupirtine was injected after stroke induction. On
the contrary, the present study successfully demonstrates
flupirtine-induced neuroprotection after treatment no
later than nine hours post-stroke. The reason for this
discrepancy might be due to different animal strains
(Wistar rats and NMRI mice) and stroke models (transient
global cerebral ischemia and permanent focal cerebral
ischemia) used. Consequently, further pre-clinical studies
are in order to further validate the therapeutic potential of
flupirtine.
In conclusion, subacute treatment with flupirtine is
an intriguing adjuvant tool next to thrombolysis inducing
long-term neuroprotection and enhanced neurological
recovery after transient focal cerebral ischemia. In light
of already been approved by local authorities in Europe as
an analgesic, adjuvant treatment of stroke with flupirtine
next to thrombolysis appears to be a feasible tool in
stroke treatment. However, further pre-clinical studies
are in order to further evaluate the therapeutic potential
of flupirtine before the path can be set for clinical trials.

Experimental mice received intraperitoneal (i.p.)
treatment with either flupirtine or normal saline. Treatment
was performed during reperfusion, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h and 12
h post-stroke. In dosage finding experiments, flupirtine
dosages ranged between 1 mg and 10 mg per kg BW. The
majority of experiments were performed using a flupirtine
dose of 10 mg per kg BW at 9 h after stroke induction. For
some experiments, intravenous injection of rt-PA (10 mg/
kg BW) or saline during reperfusion via cannulation of the
femoral vein was performed.

Induction of transient focal cerebral ischemia
Cerebral ischemia was induced as previously
described [39]. Briefly, mice were set under anesthesia
using a volatile mixture of isoflurane (1.5%), oxygen
(30%) and nitrogen (remainder). Using the thread
occlusion model, a silicon-coated nylon filament (Doccol,
USA) was inserted into the left common carotid artery
and gently pushed upwards towards the left middle
cerebral artery (MCA). The thread was kept in situ for
30 min under constant Laser Doppler flow control using
a probe (Perimed, Sweden) that was placed on the intact
skull covering the left MCA territory. A Laser Doppler
flow drop towards 30% of its initial arbitrary value was
regarded as successful induction of stroke. After thread
removal, blood flow was observed for an additional 15min period in order to guarantee reperfusion.

Assessment of brain injury and post-ischemic
angioneurogenesis
Acute brain injury was assessed on day 2 poststroke via determination of infarct volumes. Brains were
removed and cut into slices of 2 mm each. Thereafter,
slices were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC, 2%) followed by a computer-based
analysis of ischemic lesion volumes using ImageJ
software. For immunohistochemical analyses, mice were
sacrificed and transcardially perfused with saline and 4%
paraformaldehyde [40]. Brains were removed and cryostat
sections of 20 µm each were generated. Three sections per
animal were used for tissue processing for each staining.
Quantitative analyses were performed using well-defined
regions of interests (ROIs) at AP + 0.14 mm, ML ± 1.52.25 mm and DV - 2.5-3.25 mm. Four ROIs per section
were used for statistical analysis.
In order to further assess acute brain injury next
infarct volume analysis, TUNEL staining on day 2 poststroke was performed. Sections were incubated with
proteinase K (7 min, 37°C), followed by exposure to TdT
enzyme reaction according to the manufacturer’s manual
(Roche, Germany). Thereafter, sections were repeatedly
washed followed by staining with a streptavidinAlexa488-conjugated secondary antibody (2 h at room

Further immunohistochemical stainings were
done with incubation periods of 18 h (4°C) for primary
antibodies followed by repeated washing steps and an
additional incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 h at

assessment of post-ischemic angioneurogenesis, mice
received daily single injections of bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU; 50 mg/kg BW) from days 8 to 40. The primary
antibodies were as follows: monoclonal mouse antiBrdU antibody (1:400; Roche, Switzerland), monoclonal
rat anti-BrdU antibody (1:400; Abcam, UK), goat

performed using an elevated steel grid on which the mouse
was placed. Test parameters include the total number of
steps for each forelimb during the process of moving
forward. From the total amount of right forelimb steps,
the relative percentage of foot fault errors (i.e. when
animals misplaced their forelimbs) for the right forelimb
was calculated. Data is given as percentage of foot fault
errors for the right impaired forelimb referring to the total
amount of right forelimb steps.

Behavioral tests

The extent of post-ischemic burst within the
ischemic hemisphere was indirectly assessed at 48
h post-stroke using measurement of peroxidized
fatty acids of phospholipids. During this process,
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) such as
malondialdehyde (MDA) are formed. The latter reacts
with thiobarbituric acid giving rise to a chromogenic
compound, which can be photometrically measured at 532
nm [42, 43]. Data are given as MDA equivalents using
1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane as standard.

Analysis of blood-brain-barrier integrity
Integrity of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) was
analyzed 48 h after induction of stroke as previously
described [41]. Briefly, Evans blue (2%; 2 mL/kg BW)
was intravenously injected 2 h before sacrifice of animals.
Left hemispheres were weighed, homogenized in 2 mL
of 50% trichloroacetic acid and used for photometric
analysis of Evans blue extravasation. A luminescence
spectrophotometer (excitation 620 nm and emission 680
nm) was used for measurements. Values are given as (µg)
Evans blue dye per (g) tissue.

Analysis of TBARS formation

Assessment of post-ischemic neurological
impairment was done using well-defined behavioral tests
such as the rota rod, tight rope, corner turn and foot fault
test [39]. Animals were trained 1-2 days before induction
of stroke in order to ensure proper test performance. The
tests were done on days 7, 14, 28, 56 and 84 after stroke
induction. As for the corner turn test, the mouse was
placed into an apparatus consisting of two vertical boards
forming an angle of 30°. Test parameter was the mouse’s
side chosen to leave the corner once it made contact to
the boards with its whiskers. Ten trials were performed on
each day. The laterality index was calculated as follows:
(number of left turns – number of right turns)/10 with
indices approximating 1.0 demonstrating severe motor
coordination deficits. Rota rod test performance was
analyzed using a rota rod with accelerating velocity (440 rpm). Maximal velocity was achieved after 260 s and
maximal testing time was 300 s. The time until the animal
dropped was recorded and used for statistical analysis.
Mice were tested twice per time point and means were
calculated. Likewise, the tight rope test was performed
twice per time point for which the animal was placed in
the middle of a 600 mm long rope that was attached to a
platform on either side. Two parameters were assessed,
i.e. whether or not the animal reached the platform and
the time spent on the rope. Maximal testing time was
60 s. Test results are given according to a validated

Flow cytometry analysis
Flow cytometry analysis for determination of
absolute amounts of leukocytes (CD45+high) within the
ischemic hemisphere was previously described [40, 44].
Briefly, mice were sacrificed 48 h after stroke induction
followed by perfusion with PBS and preparation of left
ischemic hemispheres that were then homogenized,
centrifuged and resuspended in 30% percoll (GE
Healthcare, Sweden) that included 70% percoll below
and centrifugation of samples for 20 min at 2,400 rpm at
RT. After washing, cells were incubated with a rat antiCD45 (BioLegend, Germany) antibody for 30 min (4°C).
Countbright counting beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) were included for quantitative analysis.

Determination of protease activities

Statistical analysis

Measurement of both calpain and proteasome
activities were done at 48 h post-stroke as previously
described [43, 45]. Briefly, protease activities were
fluorimetrically determined in brain homogenates (100
mmol/L Tris-HCl, 145 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L EDTA
and 0.5% Triton X-100 at pH 7.4) using a fluorescence
microtiter plate reader at 37°C with λexc.=355 nm and
λem.=460 nm. Thereafter, lysates were used for either
determination of calpain or proteasome activity. For
detection of calpain activity, samples were incubated
with a buffer of 100 mM Tris-HCl, 145 mM NaCl and
10 mM EDTA at pH 7.4 that was supplemented with 50
μM of Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (Bachem, Switzerland)
as reaction substrate (with or without addition of 10
mM Ca2+). Proteasomal activity (i.e., chymotrypsinlike activity) was performed using a measurement
buffer consisting of 50 mmol/L Tris, 20 mmol/L KCl, 1
mmol/L magnesium acetate, 2 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 1
mmol/L leupeptin, 1 mg/mL aprotinin (Sigma-Aldrich,
Taufkirchen, Germany) and 1 mmol/L PMSF (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany). Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC served
again as substrate. As Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC is not
specific for proteasome activity, the proteasome inhibitor
MG-132 (1 mmol/L; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to some
samples. Protease activities are given in picomol per min
per milligram protein.

Data presented in this work are given as means ±
standard deviation (SD). The Student’s t test was used for
comparison between two groups. For comparison between
more groups a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Tukey’s post hoc tests was done. A p-value of
< 0.05 was regarded statistically significant.

Western blotting
Blotting was performed 48 h after stroke induction
using ischemic left hemispheres. The latter were
homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.0,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors)
followed by centrifugation steps. The supernatants were
used for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis where equal amounts
of protein (40 µg) were loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide
gels. Proteins were transferred onto membranes, which
were incubated overnight (4°C) with the following
primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-pSTAT6
(Tyr641; Abcam, UK), mouse monoclonal anti-NF-κB p65
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Germany), rabbit polyclonal
anti-phospho-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse
monoclonal anti-IκB-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Membranes were then incubated with a peroxidasecoupled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed several
times, immersed in ECL solution and exposed to ECLHyperfilm. Thereafter, membranes were scanned and
used for densitometric quantitative analysis of protein
abundance.
