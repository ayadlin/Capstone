ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths.
Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) has been used for photodynamic therapy. Mesenchymal
cancer cells adapt to tumor microenvironments for growth and metastasis possibly in
association with miRNA dysregulation. In view of the effect of PPIX on cancer-related
genes, and its potential to inhibit tumor growth and migration/invasion, this study
investigated whether PPIX enables mesenchymal liver tumor to restore dysregulated
miRNAs, and if so, whether it sensitizes the cancer cells to chemotherapy. In addition,
we explored new target(s) of the miRNA(s) that contribute to the anti-cancer effects.
Of the ten miRNAs predicted by the 3’-UTR of HIF-1α mRNA, PPIX treatment increased
miR-199a-5p, leading to the inhibition of E2F3 expression which is upregulated in
mesenchymal liver tumor. miR-199a-5p levels were downregulated in HCC with E2F3
overexpression. An approach modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition provided
the expected changes in miR-199a-5p and E2F3 in vivo. PPIX prevented tumor cell
growth and migration/invasion, and had a synergistic anti-cancer effect when
combined with chemotherapeutics. In a xenograft model, PPIX treatment decreased
overall growth and average tumor volume, which paralleled E2F3 inhibition. Overall,
PPIX inhibited growth advantage and migratory ability of cancer cells and sensitized
mesenchymal liver tumor cells to chemotherapeutics.

an anti-tumor effect in colon cancer cells. However, it
was unclear whether PPIX has an effect against tumor
cells with the EMT phenotype. In the present study, we
investigated whether PPIX treatment antagonizes the
proteins specifically overexpressed during the process of
EMT, and if so, whether PPIX sensitizes tumor cells to
chemotherapy.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) bind with the 3′-untranslated
region (3’-UTR) of complementary target mRNAs
and cause degradation and/or translational repression
[6]. Dysregulation of miRNAs is a common feature of
malignant tumors, and may function to promote oncogene
activation and/or downregulate tumor suppressors [7, 8].
A specific miRNA expression profile is developmentally
controlled and is changed with differentiation in different
cell types. Aberrant expression of miRNAs may contribute
to tumor cell proliferation and migration/invasion [7, 9].

INTRODUCTION
Aggressive tumor cells are often resistant to
chemotherapeutic agents and may undergo the epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) process through increases
of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1/2 (Zeb1/2),
snail, and twist, and the loss of E-cadherin [1]. In
addition, EMT promotes cancer cell migration, invasion,
and metastasis [2]. Several porphyrin-based chemicals
have been approved for the treatment of certain cancers
(Photofrin® and Foscan®) or actinic keratosis (Levulan®
and Metvix®) due to their light-absorbing properties [3, 4].
Silencing of ferrochelatase, an enzyme responsible for the
last step of heme biosynthesis, promoted 5-aminolevulinic
acid (ALA)-induced photodynamic anti-cancer effect
by increasing intracellular protoporphyrin IX (PPIX)
content [5]. In a previous study, we found that PPIX has

Previously, we found that PPIX suppresses HIF-1α by
inhibiting the chaperone activity of HSP90 [10]. We
also observed that PPIX treatment with cobalt chloride
decreased HIF-1α level at time zero in an experiment
using cycloheximide, indicative of an additional inhibition
of de novo protein synthesis. Since HIF-1α levels are
controlled by transcriptional and translational mechanisms
[11], we wondered whether the effect of PPIX on HIF-1α
could also result from post-transcriptional alterations by
miRNAs.
Microenvironments where a supply of oxygen and
nutrients are considerably limited play a crucial role in
angiogenesis and cancer cell migration/invasion [12,
13]. The E2F transcriptional factors are the downstream
targets of a certain tumor suppressor (i.e., retinoblastoma
gene), playing a role in cell proliferation, apoptosis,
differentiation, and tumor development [14, 15]. Since
aggressive functions of cancer cells with phenotypic
changes are orchestrated by various molecules and
signaling pathways in the need of adaptation to tumor
microenvironments, we were interested in other molecules
regulated in conjunction with HIF-1α accumulation,
and found that E2F3 expression was also controlled by
common miRNAs interacting with the HIF-1α mRNA.
Of the miRNAs putatively interacting with the
HIF-1α mRNA, we narrowed our focus to the effect of
PPIX on miR-199a-5p because the particular miRNA
regulates cancer-related genes and its expression levels
decrease in various cancers including liver, colon, breast,
bladder, and testicular cancers [16–19]. In addition,
treatment of cancers with miR-199a-5p mimic enhances
chemosensitivity by regulating autophagy [17, 20]. We
discovered that PPIX treatment markedly increased miR199a-5p levels in tumor cells, and this effect resulted in
the inhibition of E2F3, a key regulator of G1/S transition
and tumor growth [21]. Moreover, our results obtained
from cell-based studies and/or animal experiments indicate
that PPIX sensitizes a mesenchymal type of cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic agents so that combinatorial treatments
of PPIX with representative chemotherapeutics may
synergistically inhibit growth advantage and migrating
capability of malignant liver tumor cells.

repression (PLC/PRF-5 is classified as an epithelial cell
type despite slight expression of vimentin [22]). Of note,
PPIX treatment (3 μM) almost completely inhibited HIF1α overexpressed in SK-Hep1, SNU398, and SNU449
cells (Figure 1B). Moreover, PPIX downregulated
Zeb1/2, snail, slug, and twist levels in SK-Hep1 cells in a
concentration- and time-dependent manner (Figure 1C and
1D), consistent with the finding that hypoxia facilitates
EMT with HIF-1α overexpression [23, 24].
To
determine
whether
PPIX
treatment
chemosensitizes mesenchymal liver tumor cells to anticancer agents, we next assessed the effect of PPIX alone
or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents on the
cytotoxicity of a representative mesenchymal liver tumor
cell. In this experiment, we used doxorubicin and cisplatin
because these agents alone or in combination with others
have been widely applied for cancer chemotherapy but
elicit chemoresistance through miRNA dysregulation [20,
25, 26]. Although PPIX treatment alone was moderately
cytotoxic to SK-Hep1, a combinatorial treatment of
PPIX with either doxorubicin or cisplatin synergistically
enhanced cytotoxic activities as compared to each
treatment alone (Figure 1E). Our results indicate that
PPIX has a cytotoxic and chemosensitizing effect on
mesenchymal liver tumor cell.

Upregulation of miR-199a-5p by PPIX
Since miRNAs orchestrate post-transcriptional
regulation of HIF-1α, we were interested in the effect of
PPIX on the expression of miRNAs that interact with the
3’-UTR region of HIF-1α mRNA. Analysis of TargetScan
6.1 database and miRanda enabled us to extract the known
or putative miRNAs predicted to bind to the mRNA
(Figure 2A). Of the miRNAs extracted using computer
algorithms, PPIX treatment substantially increased miR199a-5p levels and to moderate degrees those of miR-519d
and -20b in SK-Hep1 cells (Figure 2B and 2C). Since
the rest of the miRNAs were unchanged in subsequent
experiments, we narrowed our focus to miR-199a-5p,
a liver-enriched miRNA, because fold-increase of the
miRNA was the greatest and basal expression of the other
miRNAs was relatively low. We also confirmed the ability
of PPIX to increase miR-199a-5p in other mesenchymal
tumor cells, SNU878 and SNU449 (Figure 2D).

HIF-1α overexpression in mesenchymal HCC
cells and chemosensitization by PPIX

Identification of E2F3 as a new target
of miR-199a-5p

To confirm the relationship between EMT and HIF1α, we measured basal HIF-1α expression in a series of
liver tumor cell lines, and found that HIF-1α levels were
greater in cancer cells with mesenchymal phenotype (i.e.,
SNU398, SNU449, SNU878, and SK-Hep1) than in those
with epithelial phenotype (i.e., Hep3B, HepG2, and PLC/
PRF5) (Figure 1A). Mesenchymal characteristics were
verified by vimentin upregulation as well as E-cadherin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Given the effect of PPIX on miR-199a-5p
expression along with its dysregulation in HCC, we next
explored the novel target(s) of miR-199a-5p to find the
underlying basis of PPIX’s anti-cancer effect. First, we
created an integrative network using putative targets of
the miRNAs affected by PPIX (i.e., miR-199a-5p, -519d,
and -20b) because combinatorial regulation is a feature

multiple targets in similar signaling pathways (Figure 3A).
In this approach, we focused on 25 candidate genes that
have the potential to be controlled by miR-199a-5p in
association with cancer growth or EMT. Forty three genes
were additionally chosen as putative targets of miR519d and -20b. In the integrated analysis, E2F3, HIF1-α,
ACVR1B, and FZD4 were linked as key molecules to

Specifically, E2F3 was a key bridging molecule to the cell

directly binding to the 3’-UTR of its mRNA; miR-199a-5p
mimic decreased luciferase expression from Luc-E2F3 3’UTR in HEK293 cells, whereas scrambled control miRNA
transfection had no effect (Figure 3B). Consistently, treatment
with anti-miR-199a-5p significantly enhanced luciferase
activity in HepG2 cells, confirming the ability of miR-199a5p to inhibit E2F3. In addition, treatment of SK-Hep1 cells
with PPIX notably diminished E2F3 levels, beginning from
1 h up to 12 h (Figure 3C upper). PPIX inhibition of E2F3
was verified in other mesenchymal tumor cell lines (Figure
3C lower). Treatment of HepG2 cells with anti-miR-199a5p diminished the inhibitory effects of PPIX on E2F3 and
HIF-1α (Figure 3D), supporting the role of PPIX in E2F3 and
HIF-1α inhibition, as mediated by increase of miR-199a-5p.

on DNA synthesis using [3H]-thymidine incorporation
assay. PPIX treatment inhibited the serum-inducible
rate of DNA synthesis in SK-Hep1 cells (Figure 5A,
left). Consistently, miR-199a-5p mimic transfection
(48 h) significantly diminished tumor cell proliferation
(Figure 5A, middle). Knockdown of E2F3 (siE2F3) also
suppressed the rate of DNA synthesis (Figure 5A, right),
suggesting that E2F3 attribute at least in part to cancer
cell proliferation. Thus, the ability of PPIX to inhibit
cancer cell may be associated with E2F3 suppression by
miR-199a-5p. In addition, transfection with miR-199a5p mimic significantly inhibited migration of SK-Hep1
cells (Figure 5B). Furthermore, we verified the ability of
PPIX to inhibit serum-induced tumor cell migration and
invasion (Figure 5C). Together, these results show that
increase of miR-199a-5p contributes to the inhibition of
tumor cell growth and migration, which may account for
the anti-tumor effect of PPIX.

Upregulation of E2F3 in human HCC samples
and in an animal model
To understand biological relevance of the identified
target in clinical situations, E2F3 levels were compared in
the samples obtained from a group of HCC patients (Figure
4A). E2F3 protein levels were significantly upregulated in a
large fraction of human tumor specimens (51 out of 59 sets of
paired HCC and adjacent non-tumor samples). In the existing
GEO database (GSE25097), E2F3 mRNA levels were also
greater in HCC than in adjacent non-tumor liver tissues
(Figure 4B). In an effort to confirm a clinical relevance of
miR-199a-5p dysregulation and E2F3 upregulation, we
measured miR-199a-5p expression in human samples (n =
59, in each group); miR-199a-5p levels were significantly
lower in HCC specimens than in adjacent non-tumor liver
tissues, indicative of miR-199a-5p dysregulation in tumor
samples (Figure 4C). Moreover, E2F3 was upregulated
when miR-199a-5p level was low in the HCC samples
(Figure 4D). To assess whether E2F3 levels were higher in
an aggressive type of cancer, we comparatively evaluated the
protein levels in a set of epithelial and mesenchymal liver
tumor cells. E2F3 levels were greater in all of the classified
mesenchymal tumor cell lines compared with the epithelial
ones (Figure 4E) (The basal E2F3 levels were inconsistent
in Hep3B). As a continuing effort to find the link between
EMT and E2F3 overexpression in liver tumor, we took an
advantage of the ability of Gα12 to promote EMT of liver
tumors [27]. Interestingly, Gα12-depletion using a shRNA
approach (shR) in a SK-Hep1-xenograft model significantly
increased miR-199a-5p level (Figure 4F). Immunoblottings
verified decreases of E2F3 and HIF-1α in shR xenograft
tissues, showing that an approach modulating EMT provided
the expected changes in both miR-199a-5p level and E2F3
expression in vivo.

The effects of PPIX on mesenchymal tumor
xenograft model
To understand the miR-199a-5p-mediated anti-cancer
effect of PPIX more in depth, we used a mesenchymal
tumor xenograft animal model derived from SK-Hep1.
Approximately 90% of BALB/c nude mice formed visible
and palpable tumor mass two weeks after an injection of
SK-Hep1 cells (n = 8 or 9, in each group). PPIX treatment
(0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg body weight, P.O. every other day
for two weeks) significantly reduced the overall tumor
growth rate and tumor weight (Figure 6A). We verified a
significant increase of miR-199a-5p in the tumor specimens
after treatments with PPIX (1.0 mg/kg) (Figure 6B). PPIX
treatment also tended to increase miR-519d and -20b
levels. Immunoblottings confirmed decreases in E2F3
and HIF-1α levels after PPIX treatments (Figure 6C).
Moreover, PPIX at the dose of 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg suppressed
the induction of E2F3, Ki-67, and CD31 in the xenograft
tumors (Figure  6D), verifying the ability of PPIX to
inhibit tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. With the
repression of molecular markers, PPIX facilitated tumor
cell death, as shown by increased intensities of TUNEL
staining (Figure 6D). The lack of changes in body weight,
serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase
activities, and total bilirubin content supported that PPIX
treatments had no deleterious effect on liver function (Figure
6E and 6F). These results provide an evidence that PPIX
effectively inhibits the growth and angiogenic advantage
of mesenchymal liver tumor cell as a consequence of the
increase of miR-199a-5p targeting E2F3 and HIF-1α.

HCC patients is mainly associated with late diagnosis,
tumor metastasis, and recurrence after surgical resection
[28]. Promising therapy for HCC metastasis is currently
very limited. Moreover, EMT phenotype represents
chemoresistance, metastasis, and poor prognosis in
HCC. Identification of chemicals that have the ability
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to specifically inhibit the targets responsible for tumor
aggressiveness would benefit from HCC therapy [28].
Our results demonstrate that PPIX treatment inhibited
the expression of vimentin, Zeb1/2, snail, slug, and
twist, EMT markers upregulated in mesenchymal HCC
cells, supportive of its anti-cancer potential against HCC

with EMT phenotype. Consistently, PPIX exhibited a
potent anti-cancer activity in the mesenchymal liver
tumor cell.
Unfortunately, liver cancers are resistant to most
of chemotherapeutic agents and a promising therapy for
HCC metastasis is yet unavailable. Although cancer cells
display chemoresistance against doxorubicin and cisplatin
[29–31], several studies have reported regimens using the
drugs as an alternative therapy of HCC [31, 32]. It has been
shown that HIF-1α and P-glycoprotein levels are positively
correlated with each other and their overexpression
facilitates multidrug resistance in cancer [33]. An important
aspect of our study is that PPIX treatment synergistically
enhanced the anti-cancer effect of doxorubicin or cisplatin
in a mesenchymal tumor cell line. Additionally, we found
that PPIX treatment inhibited P-glycoprotein in a timedependent manner (Supplementary Figure 1). Since the
uses of doxorubicin or cisplatin have been limited due to
lack of efficacy and dose-related adverse events including
cardiomyopathy, nephrotoxicity, and myelosuppression
[34, 35], our results raised potential of PPIX as an adjuvant
for anti-cancer therapy. It is expected that therapeutically
applicable doses of the anti-cancer agents may be reduced
when applied in combination with PPIX, to avoid serious
adverse effects of chemotherapy. Previously, we showed
that hemin, a derivative of PPIX, inhibits HIF-1α and
restrains neo-angiogenesis [36]. High levels of PPIX
may cause apoptosis of cancer cells in p53-dependent or
-independent pathways [37]. However, it remains obscure
how certain porphyrins inhibit cell growth and cancer
progression. Since PPIX treatment inhibits the expression
of major EMT markers increased in mesenchymal cells, the
target of PPIX is likely to be associated with repression of
the proteins.
Mature miRNAs bind imprecisely with the 3’-UTR
regions of complementary target mRNAs and manage
diverse enzymatic and regulatory functions. TargetScan
6.1 and miRanda computer algorithms enabled us to
select the putative miRNAs interacting with the 3’-UTR
of HIF-1α mRNA, and discover the unexpected ability
of PPIX to increase miR-199a-5p, -519d, and -20b.
Among them, miR-199a-5p is one of the most abundant
miRNAs in the liver. miR-199a-5p and miR-199a-3p
are both processed from the same precursor, and their
levels are lessened in several human cancers including
HCC [34, 35]. Cisplatin treatment decreases miR-199a5p, which may account for cancer chemoresistance in
advanced HCC in association with autophagy activation
[20]. Consistently, it has been shown that delivery of miR199a-5p sensitizes cancer cells to doxorubicin [18, 26]. In
our previous study, metabolite of oltipraz (M2) was found
to elevate miR-199a-5p and -20a/b levels, leading to the
inhibition of HIF1A translation in colon cancer cells [38].
Here, we report the much greater effect of PPIX on miR199a-5p (i.e., ~20 fold increase). Our findings showing
a substantial increase of miR-199a-5p by PPIX and the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

link between miR-199a-5p dysregulation and HCC may
explain the effectiveness of this agent in mesenchymal
HCC, substantiating the therapeutic potential of PPIX as a
chemosensitizing agent. p53 may interact with Drosha and
facilitate the processing of primary miRNA to precursor
form [39]. Since PPIX causes cancer cell apoptosis by
interacting with p53 [37], we speculate that p53 may be a
regulator of pri-miR-199a-5p processing.
An important finding of this study is the identification
of E2F3 as a new target of miR-199a-5p and of the
inhibitory effect of PPIX on E2F3. Interestingly, all of
the miRNA candidates, except miR-18a/b, targeting
HIF-1α have the same putative binding sites in the 3’UTR region of E2F3 mRNA. Thus, HIF-1α and E2F3
may share common roles in the progression of cancers
through the miRNAs identified. The E2F transcriptional
factors are downstream targets of the firstly identified
retinoblastoma gene (a tumor suppressor), playing a role
in cell survival, death, and differentiation [14]. Of eight
E2F members, E2F1–3 isoforms work as transcriptional
activators, whereas E2F4–8 isoforms act as transcriptional
repressors [40]. In particular, E2F3a, a major form of E2F3
expressed in quiescent cells, plays a role in regulating G1/S
transition, facilitating tumor growth and apoptosis [21, 41].
In the current study, we found E2F3 overexpression with
decrease of miR-199a-5p in mesenchymal liver tumors.
Thus, inhibition of E2F3 by PPIX through miR-199a-5p
may contribute to suppressing mesenchymal liver tumor
growth advantage. Other miRNAs such as miR-20a, -34a,
-125b, -200b, -217, and -503 may also suppress E2F3 and
induce cancer cell apoptosis [42–44].
PPIX treatment elicits cancer cell apoptosis through
its interaction with HSP90, causing p53 accumulation
in cells by interrupting the binding between p53 and
human double minute 2 [37]. While p53 represses HIF1α transcriptional activity via p300 [45], HIF-1α stabilizes
wild-type p53 [46]. Thus, the inhibitory effect of PPIX
on HIF-1α could result from the stabilization of p53.
Moreover, their interaction becomes more complicated
because p53 and HIF-1α are simultaneously activated in
several stress conditions [23, 45, 46]. Consistently, HIF1α knockdown partially inhibited the proliferation of
HCT116, an epithelial cancer cell line, in our previous
experiment [36]. HCC cells frequently harbor mutated
forms of p53 (i.e., null or minimal p53 activity) [47].
In our study, PPIX treatment inhibited HIF-1α in
mesenchymal cells having mutated forms of p53 (SNU398
and SNU449), implying that HIF-1α inhibition by PPIX
may not solely depend on p53 accumulation.
PPIX distributes reasonably well within tissues and
is metabolized quickly in normal tissue [8]. According to
a study describing sono-dynamically induced anti-tumor
effect of PPIX on hepatoma-22, PPIX in the plasma
decreased at an early time presumably due to its rapid
distribution, and the concentration maintained from 4 h
to 72 h [48]. In a preliminary experiment, treatment with
3927

Oncotarget

0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg PPIX resulted in a comparable effect on
E2F3, whereas 0.1 mg/kg PPIX had a mild effect. Since
PPIX began to inhibit HIF-1α from the dose of 0.3 mg/kg,
we chose 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg in the xenograft experiment.
Our results indicate a saturating and threshold effect of
PPIX on E2F3 at the dose of 0.3 mg/kg, showing that
PPIX sensitivity may be higher to E2F3 than HIF-1α.
The effectiveness of PPIX at the relatively low dose on
tumor was also verified by the outcomes of TUNEL, Ki67 and CD31 assays as well as qRT-PCR for miR-199a5p. CD31 is basally undetectable in SK-Hep1 despite its
endothelial origin [49–51]. Thus, increase of CD31 in the
xenograft assay represents angiogenic effect [52]. Overall,
our findings support the conclusion that PPIX inhibits
mesenchymal tumor growth and angiogenesis, which may
depend on the increase of miR-199a-5p.
The synergistic increase in the anti-cancer efficacy
of doxorubicin or cisplatin by PPIX in mesenchymal liver
tumor cells shown in our data indicates that PPIX may
be utilized for the treatment of aggressive HCC. This is
supported by the ability of PPIX to increase a specific
miRNA involved in the chemoresistance. Moreover,
PPIX inhibited E2F3 as well as HIF-1α overexpressed
in mesenchymal liver tumor cells. Thus, PPIX may be
utilized as an adjuvant of cancer therapy to not only
enhance chemosensitivity, but promote its anti-tumor
and anti-angiogenesis activities. Our study opens up
the possibility of PPIX as a potential candidate in the
treatment of advanced HCC.

Xenograft mouse model
Animal studies were conducted in accordance with
the institutional guidelines for care and use of laboratory
animals. To generate a xenograft tumor model, SK-Hep1
cells (1 × 107 cells) were subcutaneously injected into the
left flank of mice (n = 10, in each group). Mice with a
tumor volume >150 mm3 were selected two weeks after
the injection and randomly divided into three groups
(n = 8 or 9, in each group). PPIX (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg
body weight) dissolved in 40% polyethylene glycol 400
was orally administered to the mice every other day for
2 weeks. In a xenograft tumor model, shCon or shR
(Gα12)-SK-Hep1 (1 × 107 cells) were subcutaneously
injected into the left flank of mice (n = 10, in each group).
Tumor volumes were calculated using the following
formula: tumor volume (cm3) = 0.52 × (width)2 × (length).
