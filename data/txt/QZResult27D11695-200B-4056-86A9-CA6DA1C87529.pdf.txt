ABSTRACT
Cancer cells can acquire resistance to a wide variety of diverse and unrelated
drugs, this phenomenon is termed multidrug resistance (MDR). Multidrug resistance
has been an obstacle to the success of cancer chemotherapy. The present study
investigated the reversal effect of Y6, a new compound obtained by chemically
modifying the structure of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) extracted from green
tea. Y6 was proven to be effective in inhibiting cell proliferation and reversing drug
resistance in doxorubicin (DOX) resistant human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (BEL7404/DOX). BEL-7404/DOX cells were treated with either doxorubicin combination
regimen (doxorubicin plus Y6 or epigallocatechin-3-gallate or verapamil separately)
or doxorubicin alone. The results showed that cell proliferation was inhibited and late
cell apoptosis increased in the combination treatment group, especially in the group
treated with doxorubicin plus Y6. Further analysis revealed that the expressions of
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and multidrug resistance 1/P-glycoprotein decreased at
both messenger RNA and protein levels by treatments with combined drugs compared
to doxorubicin alone. Our results indicated that Y6, as a drug resistance reversal agent,
increased the sensitivity of drug resistant cells to doxorubicin. The mechanisms of
actions of Y6 in reversal effect were associated with the decreased expression of
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and multidrug resistance 1/P-glycoprotein.

INTRODUCTION

estimated to occur in China [1]. Among the liver cancers,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major histological
subtype. Various anticancer drugs such as tamoxifen,
octreotide, interferon, and interleukin-2 are used in the
treatment of HCC; however, these drugs are not specific
for HCC and demonstrate low treatment efficacy [2].

Liver cancer is a malignancy of high incidence and
mortality. It is estimated that nearly 750,000 new cases
and more than 690,000 cancer deaths occur annually
worldwide. Unfortunately, half of these cases were

RESULTS

Multidrug resistance (MDR) to anticancer drugs is the
most common cause of failure in cancer chemotherapy [3].
The mechanisms of resistance to anticancer drugs
consist of changes of pharmacokinetic or tumor microenvironment, cancer cell-specific factors which include
increased drug efflux or decreased drug influx, drug
inactivation, drug target modification, and apoptosis evasion
[4]. Of these mechanisms, the increased drug efflux/
reduced drug accumulation in the tumor cell appears to be
a very common mechanism of MDR. Hydrophobic drugs
are expelled from cells by activation of energy-dependent
transport systems [5, 6]. The first of these transporters to be
identified was P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the human
MDR1 gene [7]. P-gp is a member of the large adenosine
triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins,
also known as ABCB1. P-gp/ABCB1 has a molecular weight
of 170 kDa and comprises of two nucleotide-binding domains
(NBD1 and NBD2) and two transmembrane-binding domains
(TMD1 and TMD2) [8, 9]. P-gp/ABCB1 utilizes energy from
the hydrolysis of ATP to efflux drugs from intracellular to
extracellular matrix, leading to decreased intracellular drug
concentration [10]. Overexpression of P-gp/ABCB1 can
produce MDR in cancer cells [11].
Over the past few decades, efforts were made to
look for new compounds as resistance reversal agents to
overcome MDR in tumor cells. Verapamil was one of the
first generation of these MDR reversal agents [12]. But the
effective concentration of verapamil in reversing MDR
in vitro was too high to be achieved in vivo [13]. The dose
of verapamil required was much larger than the clinically
safe dose, resulting in toxic reactions in almost all patients.
Although second and third generations of reversal agents
were explored, they were inhibited respectively by P450 3A4
enzymes and by anticancer drugs [14–16]. In order to obtain
more effective and safer resistance reversal agents, some
natural products and their derivatives have been considered
for use in combination with anticancer drugs [17].
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of the MDR
reversal modulators (Figure 1A) [18]. It is the most abundant
catechin in green tea polyphenols. A previous study revealed
that EGCG could significantly inhibit the proliferation
of human HCC cell BEL-7404/DOX in vitro and the
tumor growth of the xenograft mouse model when it was
administrated at lower doses with doxorubicin, compared
to treatment with doxorubicin alone [19]. However, many
phenolic hydroxyl groups are included in the structure of
EGCG, which makes the compound unstable due to rapid
oxidation, low lipid solubility, low bioavailability, and short
duration of action. Therefore, its application became limited
[20]. Y6 is an ethylation product of EGCG with strong
stability (Figure 1B). The above limitations were overcome
in Y6 because most of the phenolic hydroxyl groups were
replaced by ethyl groups. In the present study, we evaluate
the potential effect of Y6 as a reversal agent that specifically
reverses ABC transporter-mediated MDR in vitro.

Y6 improved the chemosensitivity of BEL-7404/
DOX cells to doxorubicin treatment
HCC cell lines (parental BEL-7404 and doxorubicinselected resistant BEL-7404/DOX cells) were used to

examine the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin, EGCG, and
Y6 on cell proliferation using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol2-y1)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. As
shown in Figure 2, higher concentration of doxorubicin
is required to inhibit the same ratio of BEL-7404/DOX
cell proliferation than that required in BEL-7404 cells. The
IC50 value (44.14 µM) for doxorubicin in the BEL-7404/
DOX cells was 29.2 times higher than that (1.51 µM) in
the parental BEL-7404 cells (Table 1). The IC50 values of
Y6 and EGCG in this pair of cell groups were > 50 μM.
The concentrations for combined use with doxorubicin
were non-cytotoxic and below the IC10 values (Figure 2).
The non-toxic doses of verapamil, EGCG, and Y6
were individually combined with a series of doxorubicin
concentrations, and were used to treat BEL-7404 cells
and BEL-7404/DOX cells. Among them, verapamil, a
known chemosensitizer, was used as the positive control
inhibitor of P-gp in this experiment. The MTT assay
results showed that the IC50 values for doxorubicin was
significantly reduced from 44.14 to 8.39 μM by verapamil,
to 8.04 μM by EGCG, and to 5.74 μM and 4.36 μM by Y6
(10 μM) and Y6 (15 μM) respectively in the BEL-7404/
DOX cells compared with doxorubicin alone, representing
drug resistance folds decreasing from 29.2 to 5.6, 5.3,
3.8, and 2.9 respectively (Table 1). Combination groups
were compared with the doxorubicin alone group, and the
differences were statistically significant (*p < 0.05). These
results indicated that the capability of Y6 in reversing drug
resistance was higher than that of EGCG combined with
doxorubicin (#p < 0.05) (Table 1, Figure 2).

Y6 induced apoptosis in BEL-7404/DOX cells
The induction of cell apoptosis is a common
mechanism for many anti-tumor drugs. To examine whether
Y6 can induce cell apoptosis, we detected apoptotic cells in
HCC BEL-7404/DOX cells treated with verapamil (10 μM),
EGCG (10 μM), and Y6 (10 and 15 μM) in combination
with doxorubicin (10 μM) and compared with doxorubicin
(10 μM) alone. The cells that treated with verapamil were
served as the positive controls of P-gp inhibitors. BEL-7404/
DOX cells were incubated in anoxic condition for 48 h, then
subjected to Annexin V-FITC labeling and Propidium iodide
(PI) staining as described in the Materials and Methods
section. We used flow cytometry analysis to determine
the apoptotic rate of BEL-7404/DOX cells treated with
the drug combinations or doxorubicin alone. The results
showed that after treatment with any drug combination, the

expressions of hif-1α and MDR1 genes were investigated
by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) analysis after drug treatment. The results
showed that the expression of hif-1α was significantly
lower in the combination drug therapy groups
(doxorubicin plus EGCG, verapamil, or Y6) than in the
doxorubicin alone group. Expression of hif-1α was 0.90
in BEL-7404/DOX cells treated with doxorubicin (10 μM)
alone, but it decreased to 0.65 with verapamil (10 μM),
to 0.49 with EGCG (10 μM), to 0.19 with Y6 (10 μM),
and to 0.10 with Y6 (15 μM). For the MDR1 gene, the
expressions were significantly lower in the combination
drug therapy groups (doxorubicin plus EGCG or Y6,
excluding verapamil) than that in the doxorubicin alone
group. The expression of MDR1 was shown to be 0.71
in BEL-7404/DOX cells treated with doxorubicin
(10 μM) alone, but it decreased to 0.39 with EGCG
(10  μM), to 0.25 with Y6 (10 μM), and to 0.19 withY6
(15 μM). The differences were statistically significant not
only in hif-1α, but also in MDR1, when compared with
the doxorubicin group (p < 0.05) (Table 3, Figure 4).

number of cells increased in late apoptotic stage (Table 2,
Figure 3). Only 12.17% of cells showed apoptotic signals
when treated with doxorubicin alone, but the percentage
increased to 17.91% with verapamil (10 μM), to 19.52%
with EGCG (10 μM), to 27.89% with Y6 (10 μM) and to
40.03% withY6 (15 μM). The differences were statistically
significant when compared with the doxorubicin group
(*p < 0.05). Furthermore, at the same concentration, Y6 had
a higher effect than verapamil and EGCG on the induction
of apoptosis in the late apoptotic stage, and the differences
were statistically significant (#p < 0.05). In addition, the
higher the concentrations of Y6, the more cell apoptosis in
the BEL-7404/DOX cells.

with BEL-7404 cells [21, 22]. Therefore, differences in

DISCUSSION

By combining non-cytotoxic concentrations of Y6
(below the IC10 values) with doxorubicin, we determined
that Y6 potentiated the doxorubicin cytotoxic effects on
cancer cells. Our MTT assay result showed that Y6 and
EGCG could enhance the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin by
reversing multidrug resistance in BEL-7404/DOX cells.
In addition, flow cytometric analysis result revealed that
Y6 increased cell apoptosis in the late apoptotic stage. The
reversal effects of Y6 were higher than that of EGCG both
in MTT assay and in flow cytometric analysis experiments.
Our study demonstrated that Y6 has excellent ability in
increasing cell sensitivity to doxorubicin and inducing
apoptotic cell death.
Hypoxia is a common feature in solid tumors and
is generally associated with tumor chemo-resistance
[25, 26]. Hypoxia may reduce tumor sensitivity to radiation
therapy and chemotherapy by deprivation of the oxygen
essential for the cytotoxic actions directly, and lead to
increasing resistance by inducing proteomic and genomic
changes indirectly [27]. In the study by Du Cetal, hypoxia
was shown to enhance tumor development in HCC [28].

Nature is an endless source of organic compounds
for development of new drugs including resistance reversal
agents for cancer. EGCG, from the Chinese green tea, is
the effective ingredient for reversing anti-cancer drug
resistance. Alkylate modification is one way to remedy the
EGCG’s defects of low lipid solubility and stability [23].
Previous studies have shown that the ethylated and propyl
derivatives of EGCG had strong reversal effect, while
EGCG-methylated derivatives had no effect on the MDR
in hepatocellular carcinoma cells [24]. However, with the
increase of carbon chain, the toxicity to normal hepatocyte
is also increased. Therefore, the propyl derivatives were
more appropriate to be the potential anticancer drugs [24].
We synthesized six different EGCG-ethylated derivatives.
Among them, Y6 had not only more stable features but
also better lipid solubility when compared with EGCG
and other EGCG-ethylated derivatives. In this study, we
elucidated the effect and mechanism of Y6 in reversing
drug resistance in BEL-7404/DOX cells.

In the experiment by Yu G et al, the chemosensitivity to
5-FU or cisplatin in HBx-HepG2 cells was measured by
MTT assay in different hypoxic (5% O2, 3% O2, or 1%
O2) conditions. The results revealed that under hypoxic
conditions, particularly at 1% O2, the cancer killing effects
of 5-FU or cisplatin were prominently abrogated [29].
Therefore our experiment adopted the hypoxic condition
of 1% O2 to imitate the hypoxic environment of solid
tumors in vivo. HIF-1 is a central component of hypoxic
adaptation. It has been presented as an important mediator
of hypoxia-regulated gene expression and can activate the
transcription of genes that are important to cell viability,
invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis [30–32]. Hypoxia
may significantly increase the protein expression level of
HIF-1α [29]. The activation of HIF-1 is closely related to
the increased of expression of MDR1 gene and its product
P-gp protein [33–38]. P-gp protein was the first transporter
to be identified that associated to MDR. It was also the
most representative and widely studied in reversing
resistance. Previous study showed that expression of HIF1α and MDR1/P-gp could be regarded as a predictive
marker of chemotherapy resistance, and HIF-1α inhibition
was use to reverse multidrug resistance by reducing
expression of MDR1/P-gp [39]. Other studies revealed
that the expressions of hif mRNA and its encoded protein
were decreased after treatment with verapamil [40], but
there was no decrease in the level of P-gp protein [41].
To investigate whether the effect of Y6 on the
reversal of resistance was associated with decreased
P-gp expression via the HIF-1α-mediated pathway, we
measured the mRNA expressions of hif-1α and MDR1
genes by quantitative RT-PCR analysis and expressions
of their encoded proteins of HIF-1α and P-gp by Western

blotting. The BEL-7404/DOX cells were pretreated in
hypoxic condition before experiment. The results of our
study revealed that expressions of hif-1α gene and its
encoded protein were significantly down-regulated upon
the treatment with doxorubicin plus Y6. We also observed
a significant decreased expression of MDR1 gene and its
encoded protein P-gp in parallel with a decrease in HIF1α expression in BEL-7404/DOX cells. The coincident
decline of HIF-1α and MDR1/P-gp expression treated
with Y6 suggested a positive correlation between the
two proteins. Y6 were more potent in decreasing the
expressions of HIF-1α and P-gp both in gene and in
protein level than EGCG. The strong reversal effect of Y6
was most likely due to the decline of P-gp transporter.
In conclusion, the present investigation suggested
that Y6 might reverse P-gp-mediated MDR. Y6 in
combination with doxorubicin could increase the
cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in vitro. The mechanisms of
Y6 in reversing MDR are likely to be related to the HIF1α-MDR1/P-gp pathway. Y6, as a novel inhibitor resulting
from the modification of natural product, may become
an effective drug to overcome MDR in the treatment of
hepatocellular carcinoma.

RNA was reverse transcribed (RT) to cDNA by using the
PrimeScript and RT Primer Mix (including Oligo dt Primer
and Random 6 mers). For PCR amplification of cDNA,
2 μL of cDNA liquid was added to 23 μL of PCR reaction
media (including SYBR Premix Ex Taq, PCR Forward/
Reverse Primer, and double distilled water). PCRs were
carried out in the conditions according to the instructions:
initial denaturation (95°C for 30 s) followed by 40 cycles
of denaturation (95°C for 5s), and hybridization-extension
(60°C for 31s) using Applied Biosystems7300 Real Time
PCR System. The gene names (including target genes
hif-1α and MDR1 and housekeeping gene ACTB), access
number, primer sequence, and amplifying size are listed
in Table 4. In the results, transcription levels of target
genes were normalized to those of ACTB to compensate
for difference in efficiency of reverse transcription and
input RNA amounts; they were expressed relative to the
control. The relative quantitation of target gene expression
was calculated by the comparative ΔΔCT method.

Cell viability assay
The cytotoxicity of drugs to HCC cells (BEL-7404
and BEL-7404/DOX) was measured by the MTT assay
[39]. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density
of 5000 cells/well for 48 h. The cells were treated with
various concentrations of Y6, EGCG, verapamil, and
doxorubicin, or doxorubicin in combination with Y6,
EGCG, and verapamil for 48 h in hypoxic condition. Then
MTT (20 μL; 5 mg/mL) was added to each well for an
additional 4 h. The medium was removed and 100 μL of
DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the formazan
crystals that had formed. The optical density at 490nm was
measured on a multi-well plate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). The percentage of cell survival was calculated using
the background-corrected absorbance, as follows: % Cell
viability = (ODexperimental/ODcontrol) × 100.
All experiments were repeated 3 times. IC50 values
are drug concentrations at which there is 50% reduction in
optical density. The fold of drug resistance was calculated
as the IC50 of BEL-7404/DOX divided by the IC50 of BEL7404. The degree of reversal of drug resistance (reversal
fold or RF) was calculated as the IC50 with doxorubicin
alone divided by the IC50 with doxorubicin in combination
with other drugs (Y6, EGCG, and verapamil).

Western blot analysis
The BEL-7404/DOX cells were incubated in hypoxia
(1% O2) for 48 h, and then were treated with medium
alone, medium with doxorubicin alone, doxorubicin+Y6,
doxorubicin+EGCG, or doxorubicin+verapamil for
48 h. Subsequently, the cells were subjected to Western blot
analysis. Cells with different treatments were lysed in an
ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1%
SDS, sodium orthovanadate, sodium fluoride, EDTA,
leupeptin, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, and 1×phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail at 4°C for 30 min. Cell lysates were
centrifuged at 4°C with 13,000 rpm/min for 10 min.
Supernatant of cell lysates was transferred to the Eppendorf
tube and measured for protein concentrations.
Twenty-five micrograms of protein liquid from
each sample were placed in electrophoresis tanks in
a 10–12% SDS polyacrylamide gel. The cell lysates
were separated on the SDS polyacrylamide gel and then
transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose
membrane, which was pre-hybridized in methyl alcohol.
The membrane was submerged in 5% skim milk for 1 h,
and then transferred to a solution containing 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST
buffer) and a primary antibody and incubated overnight at
4°C. After washing with the TBST buffer, the membrane

Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining assay
The Bel-7404/DOX cells were incubated for 48 h,
and then were treated with medium alone, medium with
doxorubicin alone, doxorubicin+Y6, doxorubicin+EGCG,
or doxorubicin+verapamil for 48 h. Subsequently, the cells
were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. The Bel-7404/
DOX cells were suspended in Annexin V Binding Buffer at
a concentration 0.25~1.0 × 107 cells/ml. Five μL of FITC
and 10 μL of PI were added to 100μL of cell suspension per
tube in turn. The cells were mixed in vortex and incubated
for 15 minutes at room temperature (25°C) in the dark.
Annexin V Binding Buffer (400 μL) was added to each
tube. The mixed cell suspensions were analyzed by flow
cytometry. The fluorescence of the sample was detected by
Epics XL Flow Cytometry (Beckman Coulter) (Ex = 488 nm
and Em = 525 nm for Annexin V-FITC; Ex = 488 nm and
Em = 620 nm for PI).

RT-PCR analysis
The BEL-7404/DOX cells were incubated
in hypoxia (1% O2) for 48 h, and then were treated
